12,,
13,,
14,,This book was transcribed from scans of several different copies of the
15,,original found at the Internet Archive. The typesetters of the original
16,,book represented the letter ā (with a macron above) as â (with
17,,"circumflex above) when italicized, but this etext uses the macron"
18,,throughout. Words in italics in this etext were italicized in the
19,,original book. I have corrected obvious misspellings but I’ve left
20,,"variant spellings alone. Some words and names, like _yojana_ and"
21,,"_Garuda_, were spelled two different ways in the same text. I have"
22,,spelled them consistently to avoid confusion.

276,SECTION I.,
277,SECTION I.,"Entering the extensive forest of Dandaka, the irrepressible and"
278,SECTION I.,self-composed Rāma saw the collection of asylums belonging unto the
279,SECTION I.,"ascetics, strewn with Kuça and bark, and environed by spiritual energy;"
280,SECTION I.,"incapable of being beheld; like the solar disc in the heavens,—the"
281,SECTION I.,refuge of all creatures—with their ornamented yards; filled with a great
282,SECTION I.,"many deer, and abounding in multitudes of birds; in which Apsarās always"
283,SECTION I.,danced and which they held in respect; (asylums) beauteous with spacious
284,SECTION I.,"rooms for fire-sacrifice, with sacrificial necessaries, deer-skins,"
285,SECTION I.,"Kuça, faggots, water-pitchers, fruits and roots; surrounded by mighty"
286,SECTION I.,and sacred forest-trees; crowned with lucious fruits; honored with Vāli¹
287,SECTION I.,and Homa²; holy; resounding with the sounds of Vedic recitations;
288,SECTION I.,scattered with divers blossoms; and containing tanks filled with
289,SECTION I.,"lotuses; with ancient ascetics living on fruits and roots, having their"
290,SECTION I.,"senses under control, wearing bark and black deer-skins, and possessing"
291,SECTION I.,the splendour of the sun or fire; and adorned by great and holy sages
292,SECTION I.,living upon regulated fare. Beholding that collection of asylums
293,SECTION I.,"belonging unto the ascetics, resembling the regions of Brahmā, resonant"
294,SECTION I.,with the voices of Vedic recitations; and grateful; with highly pious
295,SECTION I.,"Brāhmanas versed in the Vedas,—the exceedingly energetic and graceful"
296,SECTION I.,"Rāghava entered the same, having first unstrung his mighty bow."
297,SECTION I.,"Thereupon, seeing the righteous Rāma resembling the moon risen, as well"
298,SECTION I.,"as Lakshmana and the illustrious Vaidehi, those Maharshis endeued with"
299,SECTION I.,"spiritual intuition, came forward (to meet the incomers); and, having"
300,SECTION I.,"uttered benedictions, those persons of rigid vows, received them. And"
301,SECTION I.,"those dwellers of the wood, struck with wonder, beheld Rāma’s tender"
302,SECTION I.,"grace and lovliness and elegance of dress. And struck with astonishment,"
303,SECTION I.,"those inhabitants of the woods of pre-eminent piety saw Vaidehi,"
304,SECTION I.,"Lakshmana and Rāma, with winkless eyes. And those persons of exalted"
305,SECTION I.,"virtue, engaged in the welfare of all creatures, made Rāghava, their"
306,SECTION I.,"guest, sit down in their thatched cottage. Then, having received Rāma"
307,SECTION I.,"respectfully according to scriptural prescription, those virtuous ones"
308,SECTION I.,"of eminent piety, resembling fire, procured water (for Rāma). And,"
309,SECTION I.,"experiencing great delight, those high-souled ones, uttering"
310,SECTION I.,"benedictions, procured wild fruits, flowers and roots; and, having"
311,SECTION I.,"assigned an asylum (unto Rāma), those persons cognizant of"
312,SECTION I.,"righteousness, said with joined hands, ""Possessed of high fame, thou,"
313,SECTION I.,"the protector of righteousness, art the refuge of these people. Thou"
314,SECTION I.,"shoudst be honored and worshipped, being their king, holding the rod,"
315,SECTION I.,"and their superior. O Rāghava, it is because he that governs his"
316,SECTION I.,"subjects, is a fourth part of Indra himself, that the king, being bowed"
317,SECTION I.,"down unto by all, enjoys the choicest things. And we, being in thy"
318,SECTION I.,"dominions, ought to be protected by thee. Whether living in the city or"
319,SECTION I.,"in the woods, thou, lord of men, art our sovereign. We have renounced"
320,SECTION I.,"chastising others; and, O monarch, we have conquered our anger, and"
321,SECTION I.,"subdued our passions. Therefore, even as a child in its mother’s womb"
322,SECTION I.,"(should be protected by her), should we be protected by thee."" Having"
323,SECTION I.,"said this, they entertained Rāghava, along with Lakshmana, with fruits"
324,SECTION I.,and roots and flowers and diverse other edibles procurable in the woods.
325,SECTION I.,"In the same way, other ascetics of accomplished purposes, living lives"
326,SECTION I.,"of integrity, duly pleased that lord, Rāma, resembling Vaiçyānara."

339,SECTION II.,"Having received the homage of the ascetics, Rāma about sun-rise, having"
340,SECTION II.,"greeted them all, entered into the forest. And Rāma, followed by"
341,SECTION II.,"Lakshmana, saw the heart of the forest abounding in various kinds of"
342,SECTION II.,"beasts,—ranged by bears and tigers, with its trees and shrubs torn and"
343,SECTION II.,"trampled, its pools turbid, and its birds crying. And, having in company"
344,SECTION II.,"with Sitā arrived at that forest abounding in terrible beasts, Kākutstha"
345,SECTION II.,"saw a man-eater, resembling a mountain-summit, emitting tremendous"
346,SECTION II.,"roars, with hollow eyes, a huge face, frightful, having a deformed"
347,SECTION II.,"belly, disgusting, dreadful, Cyclopean, mis-shapen, of a horrible sight,"
348,SECTION II.,"clad in a tiger-skin, besmeared with fat, covered with blood, capable of"
349,SECTION II.,"frightening all creatures, with his mouth widely extended, like unto the"
350,SECTION II.,"Destroyer himself, and uttering loud shouts,—who stood piercing with his"
351,SECTION II.,"iron dart three lions, four tigers, two leopards, four Prishatas, and"
352,SECTION II.,the huge tusked head of an elephant dripping fat. Having seen Rāma and
353,SECTION II.,"Lakshmana, as well as Sitā the daughter of Mithilā, he growing angry,"
354,SECTION II.,"rushed (against them), like the Destroyer himself rushing against"
355,SECTION II.,"creatures at the universal dissolution. Uttering a dreadful yell, and,"
356,SECTION II.,"as if making the earth tremble, he took Vaidehi on his waist, and, going"
357,SECTION II.,"a little distance, said, ""O ye wearing bark and matted locks, O ye of"

366,SECTION II.,"vaunting speech of the impious Virādha, as he said this, Janaka’s"
367,SECTION II.,"daughter, Sitā, began to tremble from fear, like a plantain tree shaken"
368,SECTION II.,"by the wind. Seeing the graceful Sitā on the waist of Virādha, Rāghava"
369,SECTION II.,"with a blank countenance said unto Lakshmana, ""O amiable one, behold the"
370,SECTION II.,"daughter of king Janaka, my wife of pure ways, an illustrious princess"
371,SECTION II.,"brought up in luxury—on Virādha’s waist O Lakshmana, what had been"
372,SECTION II.,"wished for by Kaikeyi with reference to us, (hath taken place), and the"
373,SECTION II.,dear boon (that she had asked) hath born fruit. That far-sighted lady—my
374,SECTION II.,second mother—who had not been satisfied with having secured the kingdom
375,SECTION II.,"in the interests of her son, and by whom I that was dear unto her above"
376,SECTION II.,"all other creatures, had been banished to the woods, hath to-day her"
377,SECTION II.,"wishes crowned with success. O Sumitra’s son, nothing can impart unto me"
378,SECTION II.,greater anguish than the touching of Vaidehi by another— which surpasses
379,SECTION II.,"my father’s demise and my having been deprived of the kingdom."" As"
380,SECTION II.,"Kākutstha with his eyes flooded with tears was speaking thus, Lakshmana"
381,SECTION II.,"flying into a rage, spoke like unto a confined elephant: ""Why dost thou,"
382,SECTION II.,"O Kākutstha, being the lord of all creatures and resembling Vasava"
383,SECTION II.,"himself,—and also backed by myself, thy servant,— grieve like one"
384,SECTION II.,"forlorn? The earth shall drink the gore of this Rākshasa, Virādha, when"
385,SECTION II.,"deprived of life, after he hath been slain with a shaft by my angry"
386,SECTION II.,self. That ire of mine which I had conceived against Bharata hankering
387,SECTION II.,"after the kingdom, will I discharge on Virādha; even as the weilder of"
388,SECTION II.,the thunder holt hurls his weapon at a hill. Let my mighty arrow
389,SECTION II.,acquiring velocity from the speed imparted to it through the energy of
390,SECTION II.,"my arms, light on his huge breast, and force his life from forth his"
391,SECTION II.,body; and let him whirling (at length fall down to the earth).

399,SECTION III.,"you,—who are ye and whither are ye going?"" Thereupon, the highly"
400,SECTION III.,"energetic Rāma answered the Rākshasa with a flaming face, when he had"
401,SECTION III.,thus asked (Rāma)— that he belonged to the Ikshwāku race. “Know us that
402,SECTION III.,"are in ihe forest, for Kshatriyas of respectable character. I also am"
403,SECTION III.,"anxious of knowing who thou art, that goest about the Dandakas."" Virādha"
404,SECTION III.,"answered Rāma having truth for his prowess, ""Ah! I will tell thee, O"
405,SECTION III.,"king. Do thou, O Rāghava understand! I am son unto Java, and my mother"
406,SECTION III.,is Satarhadā. All the Rākshasas of the earth have called me Virādha.
407,SECTION III.,"Having gratified Brahmā by my asceticism, I received (this boon) that"
408,SECTION III.,none in the world would be able lo slay me by mangling my body with
409,SECTION III.,"weapons. Forsaking this fair one, do ye renouncing all hope (of either"
410,SECTION III.,"recovering her or vanquishing me), speedily flee away to that place"
411,SECTION III.,"whence ye had come;—else I shall deprive you of your lives."" Thereat,"
412,SECTION III.,Rāma with his eyes reddened through wrath replied unto that Rākshasa of
413,SECTION III.,"a deformed shape, the wicked Virādha—saying, “Little! shame on thee of"
414,SECTION III.,base purposes! Thou surely seekest thy own death; and (death) thou shall
415,SECTION III.,"get in battle. Stay! Thou escapest me not with life."" Then stringing his"
416,SECTION III.,"bow, Rāma, speedily aiming at the Rākshasa, pierced him with sharpened"
417,SECTION III.,"shafts; and (then) from his bow-string let go seven shafts, having their"
418,SECTION III.,"feathered parts plaited with gold, furnished with great velocity, and"
419,SECTION III.,"coursing like Suparna or the wind. Thereat, resembling flames, those"
420,SECTION III.,"arrows furnished with peacocks’ feathers, pierced Virādha’s body, and"
421,SECTION III.,"fell to the earth, covered with blood. On being thus pierced, the"
422,SECTION III.,"Rākshasa set Vaidehi down, and, upraising a dart, rushed in wrath"
423,SECTION III.,"towards Rāma and Lakshmana. And sending forth a mighty roar, he took up"
424,SECTION III.,a dart resembling the banner of Sakra; and he then appeared like the
425,SECTION III.,Destroyer³ with opening mouth. Then the brothers showered a blazing
426,SECTION III.,"volley of shafts on the Rākshasa, resembling the Destroyer himself. And"
427,SECTION III.,"stationing himself at a spot, the Rākshasa, laughing terribly, yawned,"
428,SECTION III.,and as he yawned the flest-coursing shafts fell off from his person. And
429,SECTION III.,"by virtue of the bestowal of the boon (by Brahmā), the Rākshasa Virādha"
430,SECTION III.,"drew up his vital energies, and, lifting up a pike, darted at the"
431,SECTION III.,descendants of Raghu. That best of those bearing arms cut off with two
432,SECTION III.,arrows that dart resembling the thunder-bolt and flaming in the sky. And
433,SECTION III.,"the dart severed by the shafts of Rāma, fell to the earth, as falls a"
434,SECTION III.,"crag severed by the thunderbolt. Thereat, swiftly raising up a sword,"
435,SECTION III.,"resembling a black snake, each (of the Rāghavas) approached his"
436,SECTION III.,"antagonist, and began to assail him hastily. Thus hard beset, that"
437,SECTION III.,"terrible one, seizing them both with his arms, attempted to make away"
438,SECTION III.,"with those foremost of men, who, however, retained their calmness."
439,SECTION III.,"Reading his purpose, Rāma spake unto Lakshmana, ""Let the Rākshasa bear"

441,SECTION III.,"bear us wherever he likes. Even this, by which the ranger of the night"
442,SECTION III.,"is proceeding, is our way."" And lifting up (Rāma and Lakshmana) by his"
443,SECTION III.,"might and prowess, as if they were striplings, that haughty ranger of"
444,SECTION III.,the night laid them on his shoulders. And having deposited the Rāghavas
445,SECTION III.,"on his ihoulders, Virādha—ranger⁴ of night—sending up dreadful shouts,"
446,SECTION III.,directed his course towards the forest. And he at length entered the
447,SECTION III.,"forest resembling a mighty mass of clouds, furnished with various kinds"

481,SECTION IV.,left arm; while Rāma at once broke the Rākshasa’s right one. On his arms

486,SECTION IV.,trod on him over the ground. Although he was sore pierced by full many
487,SECTION IV.,"an arrow and cut sorryly by scimitars, and pressed down on the earth in"
488,SECTION IV.,"various ways, yet the Rākshasa expired not. Seeing him utterly incapable"
489,SECTION IV.,"of being killed, and resembling a hill, that inspirer of hope in times"
490,SECTION IV.,"of peril, the graceful (Rāma), said, ""O foremost of men, in consequence"

496,SECTION IV.,"Virādha’s throat. Having heard Rāghava’s words, the Rākshasa spake"

567,SECTION V.,many a high-souled personage dressed in the same way. And from a
568,SECTION V.,"distance, (Rāma) saw the car stationed in the sky yoked with green"

579,SECTION V.,seeming as if the sun had fallen from the heavens. The steeds standing
580,SECTION V.,in the sky are for certain those of which we had formerly heard as
581,SECTION V.,"belonging unto Sakra of many sacrifices. And, thou foremost of men,"
582,SECTION V.,"these youths environing (the celestial) by hundreds, wearing earrings,"
583,SECTION V.,"and bearing swords in their hands, are broad of chest, have arms"

586,SECTION V.,"chains of blazing sheen; and, O son of Sumitrā, their beauty appears"
587,SECTION V.,that of five and twenty. And even this is the ever-enduring age of the
588,SECTION V.,"celestials, as these foremost of men of sweet looks appear. O Lakshmana,"
589,SECTION V.,"stay here awhile with Vaidehi, so long as I do not gather who it is that"

595,SECTION V.,"he shall have vanquished (his foe in fight), and won success, shall I"
596,SECTION V.,readily show myself unto him. He shall have to achieve an act incapable

598,SECTION V.,"and conversing with him, the weilder of the thunderbolt—subduer of"
599,SECTION V.,enemies—repaired to heaven in a car yoked with steeds. When the
600,SECTION V.,"thousand-eyed one had gone away, Rāghava accompanied by his companions"

609,SECTION V.,became anxious to go to the minor celestial regions and this supreme
610,SECTION V.,"heaven (of Brahmā), after I had seen thee, righteous and high-souled,"
611,SECTION V.,"who art my dear guest now. O foremost of men, I have for aye attained"
612,SECTION V.,the excellent regions of Brahmā. and Nākaprishtha. Do thou receive them
613,SECTION V.,"as pertaining to me."" Thus addressed by the sage, Sarabhanga, that best"
614,SECTION V.,"of men, Rāghava, versed in every branch of learning, said, ""O mighty"
615,SECTION V.,"anchoret, I shall acquire all those regions myself. I now wish that thou"
616,SECTION V.,"mayst direct me as to my abode in this forest."" Thus accosted by Rāghava"

670,SECTI0N VI.,"having thee for their lord, are being sorely troubled by Rākshasas, as"

675,SECTI0N VI.,Chitrakuta. We cannot bear the terrible affliction of the ascetics in

681,SECTI0N VI.,"Hearing these words of the sages and ascetics, that righteous-souled one"
682,SECTI0N VI.,"addressed them, saying, ""It doth not behove you to speak thus. I should"

684,SECTI0N VI.,view to my own purpose. I have entered this forest in obedience to the
685,SECTI0N VI.,"mandate of my father, with the object (at the same time) of putting an"
686,SECTI0N VI.,end to these ravages of the Rākshasas on you. I have at my own will come
687,SECTI0N VI.,hither for securing your interest. Then shall my stay in the woods be

706,SECTION VII.,"forest abounding in blossoms and fruits and trees, Rāma saw in a recess"

708,SECTION VII.,"an ascetic seated in the lotus-attitude⁹ for warding off evil, even"
709,SECTION VII.,"Sutikshna, ""O thou conversant with righteousness, speak to me, O"
710,SECTION VII.,"Maharshi, O thou that hast truth for thy prowess."" Thereupon, eying Rāma"
711,SECTION VII.,"keenly, that calm (ascetic)—the foremost of those practising"
712,SECTION VII.,"righteousness, embracing him with his arms, said, ""Welcome, thou"
713,SECTION VII.,"foremost of the Raghus, O Rāma, thou the best of those practising"
714,SECTION VII.,righteousness. This asylum now hath been furnished with its master in
715,SECTION VII.,"consequence of thy visit. O illustrious one, O hero, expecting thee, I"
716,SECTION VII.,"have not yet ascended heaven, renouncing on earth this body of mine. I"
717,SECTION VII.,"had (already) heard that, coming to Chitrakuta, (thou hadst been staying"
718,SECTION VII.,"there), having been deprived of the kingdom. Here came, O Kākutstha, the"
719,SECTION VII.,"Sovereign of the celestials of an hundred sacrifices. Coming to me, that"
720,SECTION VII.,"mighty deity, the Sovereign of the celestials, said that I had acquired"
721,SECTION VII.,"all the worlds by my pious acts. Do thou, by my grace, in company with"
722,SECTION VII.,"thy wife and Lakshmana, dwell delightfully in those regions won by my"
723,SECTION VII.,"asceticism, containing Devarshis."" Thereupon the self-possessed Rāma"
724,SECTION VII.,"answered that blazing and truth-telling Brahmana of fiery austerities,"
725,SECTION VII.,"like Vasava answering Brahma, saying, ""O mighty ascetic, I myself will"
726,SECTION VII.,win those regions. I wish to be directed to a dwelling in this forest.
727,SECTION VII.,"Thou art possessed of ability in respect of everything, and art (at the"
728,SECTION VII.,"same time) engaged in the welfare of all beings,—this hath been told"

730,SECTION VII.,"addressed by Rāma, that Maharshi known over all the worlds, spoke sweet"
731,SECTION VII.,"words ia great joy, ""O meritorious Rāma, even this is the asylum (for"
732,SECTION VII.,thee). Do thou live here pleasantly. It is inhabited by numbers of
733,SECTION VII.,saints and is always provided with fruits and roots. This forest is
734,SECTION VII.,"haunted by herds of deer that range here without doing harm to any one,"
735,SECTION VII.,"although they possess great energy; and go away, having bewitched people"
736,SECTION VII.,"(by their beauty). Save what comes from these deer, there is no other"
737,SECTION VII.,"evil to be encountered here."" Hearing those words of the Maharshi, the"
738,SECTION VII.,"placid elder brother of Lakshmana, taking up his bow with the arrow set,"
739,SECTION VII.,"said ""O exalted one, if by means of sharpened shafts blazing like"
740,SECTION VII.,"lightning, I slay those herds of deer when they come, it shall impart"
741,SECTION VII.,"pain unto thee,—and what can be more unfortunate than this? Therefore I"

744,SECTION VII.,"finished them, along with Sitā and Lakshmana fixed his quarters in the"

800,SECTION IX.,"righteousness), yet thou art on the eve of entering into"
801,SECTION IX.,"unrighteousness. But thou couldst by refraining from action, eschew this"
802,SECTION IX.,unrighteousness that springs from an evil begot of desire. This evil
803,SECTION IX.,"begot of desire is threefold. One prominent evil is falsehood, and both"
804,SECTION IX.,"the others are of weightier significance, —association with others’"
805,SECTION IX.,"wives, and vindictiveness without any (basis of) hostility. Falsehood, O"
806,SECTION IX.,"Rāghava, hath never been thine, nor can it ever be thine (in the"
807,SECTION IX.,"future). Nor yet, O foremost of men, canst thou ever even in fancy be"
808,SECTION IX.,"(guilty of) going after others’ wives, which marreth all religious"
809,SECTION IX.,"merit. These, O Rāma, are by no means in thee. O King’s son, thou ever"
810,SECTION IX.,and a day directest thy attentions unto thy own wife. And thou art
811,SECTION IX.,righteous and truthful and doest the will of thy sire. In thee are
812,SECTION IX.,established virtue and truth—and every thing; and by help of thy
813,SECTION IX.,"conquered senses, thou, O mighty-armed one, art capable of bearing"
814,SECTION IX.,"everything. And, O thou of a gracious presence, thine is control over"
815,SECTION IX.,sense. The third evil that leads men through ignorance to bear hostility
816,SECTION IX.,"towards others without any (cause of) hostility, is now present (unto"
817,SECTION IX.,"thee). Thou hast, O hero, for the protection of the saints dwelling in"
818,SECTION IX.,"the forest of Dandaka, promised the slaughter of Rākshasas in battle."
819,SECTION IX.,"And it is for this reason that equipped with bows and arrows, thou hast"
820,SECTION IX.,along with thy brother set out for the forest known as Dandaka. Seeing
821,SECTION IX.,"thee set out, my mind reflecting on thy truthfulness as well as thy"
822,SECTION IX.,"happiness in this world and welfare in the next, is wrought up with"
823,SECTION IX.,"anxiety. And, O hero, I do not relish this journey to Dandaka. Thereof I"
824,SECTION IX.,will tell thee the reason. Do thou listen to me as I tell thee. Bearing
825,SECTION IX.,"bows and arrows in thy hands, thou hast come to the wood along with thy"
826,SECTION IX.,brother; and (it may well happen) that seeing grim rangers of the
827,SECTION IX.,"forest, thou mayst discharge thy shafts. And even as the vicinity of"
828,SECTION IX.,"faggots increases the energy of (ire, the proximity of (the bow)"
829,SECTION IX.,"enhances the strength and energy of the Kshatriya. Formerly, O"
830,SECTION IX.,"long-armed one, in a sacred wood haunted by beasts and birds, there"
831,SECTION IX.,lived a truthful ascetic of a pure person. Intending to disturb his
832,SECTION IX.,"austerities, Sachi’s lord, Indra, bearing a sword in his hand, came to"
833,SECTION IX.,"the asylum in the guise of a warrior. And in that asylum, that excellent"
834,SECTION IX.,scimitar was deposited as a trust with that righteous person practising
835,SECTION IX.,"asceticism. Receiving that weapon, that ascetic intent upon preserving"
836,SECTION IX.,"his trust, rangeth the forest, maintaining his faith. And intent upon"
837,SECTION IX.,"preserving his trust, he goeth nowhere for procuring fruits and roots"
838,SECTION IX.,without that sword deposited with him as a trust. Constantly carrying
839,SECTION IX.,"the sword, by degrees, the ascetic, foregoing all thoughts about"
840,SECTION IX.,"asceticism, had his mind involved in fierce sentiments. Thus in"
841,SECTION IX.,"consequence of bearing that weapon, that ascetic taken up with fierce"
842,SECTION IX.,"thoughts, losing his sobriety and led astray from righteousness, went to"
843,SECTION IX.,"hell. This ancient story anent the carrying of arms, asserts that even"
844,SECTION IX.,"as fire worketh change in a piece of wood, the presence of arms worketh"
845,SECTION IX.,alteration in the mind of him bearing them. From affection and the high
846,SECTION IX.,"honor in which I hold thee, I merely remind thee of this matter. I do"
847,SECTION IX.,"not teach thee. Equipped with bows as thou art, thou shouldst renounce"
848,SECTION IX.,all thoughts of slaying without hostility the Rākshasas residing in
849,SECTION IX.,Dandaka. Without offence none should be slain.—It is the duty of
850,SECTION IX.,Kshatriya heroes by means of their bows to protect persons of subdued
851,SECTION IX.,"souls, come by any calamity. Where are arms? And where is the forest?"
852,SECTION IX.,Where is Kshatriya virtue? And where is asceticism? These arc opposed to
853,SECTION IX.,"each other,—let us, therefore, honor the morality that pertains to this"
854,SECTION IX.,"place. From following arms, one’s sense gets befouled and deformed."
855,SECTION IX.,"Again going to Ayodhyā, thou wilt observe the duties of Kshatriyas. Then"
856,SECTION IX.,"my mother-in-law and father-in-law shall experience enduring delight,"
857,SECTION IX.,"if, having renounced the kingdom, thou lead the life of an ascetic."
858,SECTION IX.,Interest springs from righteousness; and happiness also results
859,SECTION IX.,therefrom. One attains everything through righteousness—in this world
860,SECTION IX.,"the only substantial thing. Repressing self by diverse restrictions,"
861,SECTION IX.,intelligent people attain righteousness; but virtue crowned with
862,SECTION IX.,"felicity, is incapable of being attained by following pleasure. O mild"
863,SECTION IX.,"one, ever cherishing thy heart in purity, do thou practise piety, in the"
864,SECTION IX.,wood of asceticism. Everything—the three worlds—are truly known unto
865,SECTION IX.,thee. I have spoken this through feminine fickleness. Who can speak of
866,SECTION IX.,"righteousness unto thee? Reflecting on and understanding things, do thou"

990,SECTION XI.,hermitage in a southerly direction; and thou wilt come to the hermitage
991,SECTION XI.,of the brother of the auspicious Agastya situated on a land covered with
992,SECTION XI.,"trees, graced with _Pippali_ woods, abounding in fruits and flowers,"
993,SECTION XI.,"charming, and resonant with the notes of various birds. There are many"
994,SECTION XI.,"tanks containing delightful waters, swarming with swans and Karandavas,"
995,SECTION XI.,"and beauteous with Chakravakas. Passing a night there, do thou, O Rāma,"
996,SECTION XI.,"in the morning, taking a southerly course, go by the skirts of the"
997,SECTION XI.,"forest tract. Passing a _yojana_, thou shalt come upon Agastya’s asylum,"
998,SECTION XI.,located at a charming woodland graced with many a tree. There Videha’s
999,SECTION XI.,daughter and Lakshmana shall experience delight in thy company. O
1000,SECTION XI.,"magnanimous one, if thou intend to see the mighty ascetic, Agastya, in"
1001,SECTION XI.,"that charming woodland, containing a great many trees, then do thou make"
1002,SECTION XI.,up thy mind to set out this very day.” Hearing these words of the
1003,SECTION XI.,"anchoret, Rāma, saluting him, along with his brother, set off for"
1004,SECTION XI.,"Agastya’s (place) with his younger brother and Sitā. And, pleasantly"
1005,SECTION XI.,"proceeding by the way directed by Sutikshna, seeing pirturesque woods,"
1006,SECTION XI.,"hills resembling clouds, watery expanses and streams flowing by their"
1007,SECTION XI.,"path; Rāma filled with delight said these words unto Lakshmana, “Surely"
1008,SECTION XI.,"we see the asylum of that high-souled one, the ascetic, Agastya’s"
1009,SECTION XI.,brother of pious acts. These trees standing by thousands on the way
1010,SECTION XI.,"bending beneath the weight of fruits and flowers, hear the signs that"
1011,SECTION XI.,had been mentioned to me as belonging to this wood. And from the wood is
1012,SECTION XI.,wafted by the wind the pungent odour of ripe _pippalis_. And here and
1013,SECTION XI.,"there are found heaps of fire-wood, and torn _Darva_ are seen, of the"
1014,SECTION XI.,lustre of lapises. And the top of the column of smoke belonging unto the
1015,SECTION XI.,"fire lit in the asylum in this wood, appears like the peak of a dark"
1016,SECTION XI.,"mountain. And twice-born ones, having performed their ablutions in"
1017,SECTION XI.,"sacred and retired bathing places, are offering flowers gathered by"
1018,SECTION XI.,"themselves, O placid one, from what I had heard from Sutikshna, this"
1019,SECTION XI.,would appear to be the asylum of Agastya’s brother. The righteous
1020,SECTION XI.,"Agastya it is who, wishing for the welfare of the worlds, destroying by"
1021,SECTION XI.,"virtue of his austerities a Daitya resembling Death, hath rendered this"
1022,SECTION XI.,"quarter habitable. Once on a time here dwelt together two mighty Asuras,"
1023,SECTION XI.,brothers given to slaughtering Brāhmanas—the wily Vātāpi and Ilwala.
1024,SECTION XI.,"Wearing the form of a Brāhmana, and speaking Sanskrit, the cruel one"
1025,SECTION XI.,"used to invite Vipras to a _Srāddha_. And, cooking his brother wearing"
1026,SECTION XI.,"the shape of a sheep, he used to feed the twice-born ones according to"
1027,SECTION XI.,"the rites prescribed for _Srāddhas_. Then when the Vipras had fed,"
1028,SECTION XI.,"Ilwala said,— ""O Vātāpi, come out, uttering a loud sound."" Hearing his"
1029,SECTION XI.,"brother’s words, Vātāpi, bleating like a sheep, came out, riving their"
1030,SECTION XI.,"bodies. In this way, thousands of Brāhmanas gathered together, were"
1031,SECTION XI.,destroyed by flesh-eating ones wearing shapes at will. (And it came to
1032,SECTION XI.,"pass that once upon a time) the Maharshi Agastya, having been invited to"
1033,SECTION XI.,"a Srāddha, fed on the mighty Asura. Thereupon uttering—’Finished’ and"
1034,SECTION XI.,"offering water to wash hands with, Ilwala said unto his brother, ’Come"
1035,SECTION XI.,"out’! And, as that brother of Vātāpi, given to slaughtering Vipras was"
1036,SECTION XI.,"speaking thus, that foremost of ascetics, the intelligent Agastya, said"
1037,SECTION XI.,"with a laugh, ’Where is the power of coming out, of the Rākshasa, thy"
1038,SECTION XI.,"brother wearing the shape of a sheep, who hath gone to Yama’s abode?’"
1039,SECTION XI.,"Hearing his words, from wrath the ranger of the night prepared to assail"
1040,SECTION XI.,"the ascetic, and he rushed against that foremost of the twice-born ones."
1041,SECTION XI.,"And, being consumed by that ascetic of flaming energy with his eyes"
1042,SECTION XI.,"resembling fire, the Rākshasa met his end. This asylum graced with pools"
1043,SECTION XI.,and groves belongs to the brother of him who hath performed this arduous
1044,SECTION XI.,feat from compassion for the Vipras’. As Rāma was thus conversing with
1045,SECTION XI.,"Sumitrā’s son, the sun set and evening approached. Then, duly performing"
1046,SECTION XI.,"his afternoon adorations along with his brother, Rāma entered the"
1047,SECTION XI.,"hermitage, and saluted the ascetic. Well received by the ascetic,"
1048,SECTION XI.,"Rāghava spent there a night, eating fruits and roots. When the night had"
1049,SECTION XI.,"passed away, and the solar disc arose, Rāghava greeted Agastya’s"
1050,SECTION XI.,"brother, saying, ""O reverend Sir, I salute thee. I have pleasantly"
1051,SECTION XI.,"passed the night. I greet thee; I shall go to behold my preceptor, thy"
1052,SECTION XI.,"elder brother."" Thereat, on the ascetic’s saying, ’Go thou,’ the"
1053,SECTION XI.,descendant of Raghu went away by the prescribed route. And Rāma viewed
1054,SECTION XI.,"the forest, and Nihāras, and Panaças, and Sālas, Vanjulas and Tinisas,"
1055,SECTION XI.,"and Chirivilwas, and Madhukas, and Vilvas, and Tindukas,—all in full"
1056,SECTION XI.,"flower, and graced with blossoming creepers, and trees in the wood by"
1057,SECTION XI.,"hundreds, roughly handled by elephants with their trunks, and graced by"
1058,SECTION XI.,"monkeys, and resounding with the voices of an hundred maddened warblers."
1059,SECTION XI.,"Then the lotus-eyed Rāma said unto that enhancer of auspiciousness, the"
1060,SECTION XI.,"heroic Lakshmana, who was by him, and was following him at his back,"
1061,SECTION XI.,"""The leaves of these trees are glossy, and the beasts and birds are"
1062,SECTION XI.,"mild, even as (we had been told). The asylum of the pure-hearted"
1063,SECTION XI.,Maharshi must not be far. This asylum capable of removing the fatigue of
1064,SECTION XI.,"the weary, belonging to him that is known among men as Agastya by his"
1065,SECTION XI.,"own acts, is seen, with the (neighbouring woods) filled with smoke, and"
1066,SECTION XI.,"itself decorated with bark and wreaths, containing herds of mild deer,"
1067,SECTION XI.,and ringing with the notes of various birds. This is the asylum of that
1068,SECTION XI.,"pious one, who destroying (the Asura resembling) Death, hath, desirous"
1069,SECTION XI.,"of the welfare of mankind, rendered the Southern quarter habitable, and"
1070,SECTION XI.,through whose potency the Rākshasas from fear barely cast their eyes in
1071,SECTION XI.,"this direction, but do not approach. Ever since that one of pious ways"
1072,SECTION XI.,"possessed himself of this quarter, the rangers of the night have"
1073,SECTION XI.,"foregone their hostility, and assumed a peaceful attitude. This Southern"
1074,SECTION XI.,"quarter rendered safe (by Agastya),and incapable of being harassed by"
1075,SECTION XI.,"those ones of tortuous ways, is celebrated over the three worlds in"
1076,SECTION XI.,conection with the name of the reverend ascetic. And this graceful
1077,SECTION XI.,asylum ranged by mild beasts belongs to that long-lived one of renowned
1078,SECTION XI.,"achievements— Agastya—in obedience to whose command, the Vindhya"
1079,SECTION XI.,mountain—foremost of its kind—which had always obstructed ihe way of the
1080,SECTION XI.,"Sun, doth not increase. This pious one honored of men, ever engaged in"
1081,SECTION XI.,"the welfare of the righteous, shall do good unto us, who have come to"
1082,SECTION XI.,"him. I shall adore the mighty ascetic, Agastya, and, O mild one, O"
1083,SECTION XI.,"master, here pass away the remainder of the term of my banishment. Here"
1084,SECTION XI.,"celestials with the Gandharbas, and Siddhas and eminent saints,"
1085,SECTION XI.,"observing restrictions in respect of food, adore Agastya. And the"
1086,SECTION XI.,"ascetic is such that a liar cannot live here, nor a cunning or a crafty"
1087,SECTION XI.,"person, nor a wicked wight, nor one that is given to unrighteousness."
1088,SECTION XI.,"And adoring righteousness, celestials, and Yakshas, and Nāgas, and"
1089,SECTION XI.,"birds, live here restricting their fare. And high-souled Siddhas and"
1090,SECTION XI.,"eminent saints, renouncing their bodies, repair to celestial regions in"
1091,SECTION XI.,"cars resembling the sun. And adored by auspicious individuals, the"
1092,SECTION XI.,"deities here confer on them the states of Yakshas and celestials, and"

1307,SECTION XV.,Then repairing to Panchavati filled with various animals and beasts of

1309,SECTION XV.,"come to the place to which we had been directed by the ascetic. This, O"
1310,SECTION XV.,"amiable one, is Panchavati furnished with blossoming woods. Do thou cast"

1313,SECTION XV.,"thyself Sitā and I may dwell happily, which is graced with the garniture"
1314,SECTION XV.,"of woods and delightful with liquid lapses, and whose neighbourhood"
1315,SECTION XV.,"yields fuel, flowers, Kuça and water."" Thus addressed by Rāma, Lakshmana"
1316,SECTION XV.,"with joined hands, said unto Kākutstha in the presence of Sitā, ""O"
1317,SECTION XV.,"Kākutstha, even if I were to stay with thee for an hundred years, I"
1318,SECTION XV.,"shall remain thy servant. Thyself selecting some beauteous spot, do thou"
1319,SECTION XV.,"tell me—’Construct (an asylum).’"" Well pleased with the words of"
1320,SECTION XV.,"Lakshmana, that highly effulgent one, after due reflection, selected a"
1321,SECTION XV.,site having every recommendation. Going to that romantic spot for
1322,SECTION XV.,"rearing an asylum, Rāma, taking the hand of Sumitra’s son in his, said"
1323,SECTION XV.,"unto him, ""This place is level, graceful, and surrounded with blossoming"
1324,SECTION XV.,trees. Do thou duly construct an asylum at this spot. Hard by is seen a
1325,SECTION XV.,"beautiful pool, embellished with lotuses, resembling the sun, and"
1326,SECTION XV.,"breathing balmy perfume. And, as told by that pure-hearted ascetic,"
1327,SECTION XV.,"Agastya, this is the graceful Godavari, bordered by flowering"
1328,SECTION XV.,"trees;—swarming with swans and Kārandavas, delighted with Chakravākas;"
1329,SECTION XV.,"thronged with herds of deer¹⁴, not far, yet not so very near. And"
1330,SECTION XV.,resounding with the cries of peacocks; charming; elevated; containing
1331,SECTION XV.,"full many a cave; do thou, O amiable one, behold these hills, covered"
1332,SECTION XV.,with trees in full flower; and they are shining like elephants painted
1333,SECTION XV.,"with diverse colors by persons with the utmost care; adorned with Sālas,"
1334,SECTION XV.,"palmyras, Tamālas, dates, Panasas, Nivāras, Tinisas, and Punnāgas. And"

1339,SECTION XV.,"spot abounds in beasts and birds. Here will I dwell, O Sumitra’s son, in"
1340,SECTION XV.,"company with this bird¹⁵."" Thus addressed by Rāma, the exceedingly"
1341,SECTION XV.,"powerful Lakshmana, slayer of hostile heroes, in a short time raised an"
1342,SECTION XV.,asylum for his brother. And the exceedingly stout Lakshmana created
1343,SECTION XV.,"there for Rāghava a spacious hut thatched with leaves made of clay,"
1344,SECTION XV.,"furnished with pillars, constructed with long bamboos, graceful,—spread"
1345,SECTION XV.,"with Sami boughs; tightly fastened with strong cords; covered with Kuçā,"
1346,SECTION XV.,"reeds, and leaves; with its floor well leveled; and charming; beautiful"
1347,SECTION XV.,"to look at, and exceedingly excellent. And then going to the river"
1348,SECTION XV.,"Godavari, the lovely Lakshmana, performing his bath, and securing"
1349,SECTION XV.,"lotuses and fruits, came back (to the asylum). Then offering flowers,"
1350,SECTION XV.,"and duly performing rites for the peace (of the habitation), Lakshmana"
1351,SECTION XV.,showed the asylum which he had made unto Rāma. Seeing the beautiful
1352,SECTION XV.,"asylum along with Sitā, Rāghava experienced high raptures. And joyfully"
1353,SECTION XV.,"embracing Lakshmana with his arms, Rāma said these exceedingly calm and"
1354,SECTION XV.,"solemn words, ""Pleased am I with thee. Thou hast done a great deed, my"
1355,SECTION XV.,brother; for which I have granted thee my embrace by way of reward.
1356,SECTION XV.,"While thou, his son, skilled in reading thought, grateful, and cognizant"

1374,SECTION XVI.,"once on a time, when the night had passed away and day broke, that son"
1375,SECTION XVI.,of Raghu went to the romantic river Godāvari for performing his bath.
1376,SECTION XVI.,And as the humble son of Sumitrā Rāma’s puissant brother bearing a water

1380,SECTION XVI.,the entire auspicious year. Now people have their persons rendered rough
1381,SECTION XVI.,from dew; the earth is replenished with corn; water is difficult of
1382,SECTION XVI.,being used; and fire becomes enjoyable. And men having worshipped the
1383,SECTION XVI.,gods and the Pitris by celebrating Agrayana on the occasion of partaking
1384,SECTION XVI.,"new rice, have at this season, their sins purged off. The provinces"
1385,SECTION XVI.,"overflow with food, and abound in milk and articles prepared there-"

1387,SECTION XVI.,the sun having veered steadily to the quarter presided over by the
1388,SECTION XVI.,"Destroyer¹⁶, the north appears like a female without her _tilaka_¹⁷."
1389,SECTION XVI.,"Naturally abounding in snow, and now having the sun at a great distance,"
1390,SECTION XVI.,the mountain Himavān¹⁸ justly beareth that name. At miday the days are
1391,SECTION XVI.,"delightful to a degree to range in, feel highly agreeable, and have"
1392,SECTION XVI.,pleasant suns; while shade and water are uncomfortable. And the days now
1393,SECTION XVI.,"have mild suns, are covered with dew, severely cold, with the forests"
1394,SECTION XVI.,"remaining idle¹⁹, and the lotuses destroyed by frost. And now at night"
1395,SECTION XVI.,people cannot lie down in unsheltered places; and the nights are
1396,SECTION XVI.,inferred from the presence of Pushyā. And at night the atmosphere (being
1397,SECTION XVI.,covered with vapour) looks brown; and it is bitter cold then; and the
1398,SECTION XVI.,hours are long. And the good fortune of the Moon hath fallen to the Sun;
1399,SECTION XVI.,and the disc of the former is reddish with vapour; and like unto a glass
1400,SECTION XVI.,"breathed upon, it doth not shine clearly. And the moonlight furnished by"
1401,SECTION XVI.,vapour doth not appear pleasant; and like Sitā pallid because of
1402,SECTION XVI.,"(exposure to) sunshine, is perceptible, but doth not look beauteous. And"
1403,SECTION XVI.,"at this season the western wind naturally of gelid feel, being permeated"
1404,SECTION XVI.,"at present with cold, blows with double coldness. And the forests"
1405,SECTION XVI.,"enveloped in mist, and stocked with wheat and barley, look brilliant at"
1406,SECTION XVI.,"sunrise, with Kraunchas and cranes crying (in chorus). Golden-hued paddy"
1407,SECTION XVI.,"slightly inclined, appear graceful, with their heads like unto"
1408,SECTION XVI.,"date-flowers filled with rice. And the sun although high advanced, yet"
1409,SECTION XVI.,"having its rays covered with thick mist, appeareth like the moon. And"
1410,SECTION XVI.,"feeble at the first part of the day, and of agreeable touch at mid-day,"
1411,SECTION XVI.,"the sunshine, being surcharged with mist, appeareth palish over the face"
1412,SECTION XVI.,"of the earth. And in the woods, swards covered with green grass, and"
1413,SECTION XVI.,"with dew-drops on it, look handsome on the morning sun brightening it"
1414,SECTION XVI.,"up. And wild elephants waxing exceedingly thirsty, draw away their"
1415,SECTION XVI.,"trunks, just as they touch beautifully clear and cold water. And those"
1416,SECTION XVI.,"aquatic fowls seated by, do not dip themselves in the water, like unto"
1417,SECTION XVI.,"cravens shunning fight. And the rows of trees, shorn of their blossoms,"
1418,SECTION XVI.,"on being enveloped with dew at night and mist at morn, look as if they"
1419,SECTION XVI.,were fast asleep. And the streams appear with their waters enveloped in
1420,SECTION XVI.,"vapour,and the cranes, perceived through their cries, and their banks"
1421,SECTION XVI.,"having their sands wet. And what on account of the snow-fall, what of"
1422,SECTION XVI.,"the mildness of the sun, and what through the cold, water even when it"
1423,SECTION XVI.,"is on a mountain top, tastes sweet. And lotuses afflicted by the cold,"
1424,SECTION XVI.,"with the stalks only left, and with their petals dropping down and their"
1425,SECTION XVI.,"pericarps and filaments shrivelled up, do not appear beautiful. And, O"
1426,SECTION XVI.,"foremost of men, at this season, influenced by regard for thee, Bharata"
1427,SECTION XVI.,"undergoing affliction of spirit, is performing mortifications in the"
1428,SECTION XVI.,"city. And forsaking kingdom, and dignity, and the many and various"
1429,SECTION XVI.,"enjoyments, Bharata practising asceticism and restraining himself in"
1430,SECTION XVI.,"respect of food, in this winter lieth down on the bare earth. And he"
1431,SECTION XVI.,"also, for certain, at this hour of the day, surrounded by his subjects,"
1432,SECTION XVI.,daily wendeth to the river Sarayu for performing his ablutions. Brought
1433,SECTION XVI.,"up in luxury, and exceedingly tender, how can he, afflicted with cold,"
1434,SECTION XVI.,perform his ablutions during the latter part of the night? Of eyes
1435,SECTION XVI.,"resembling lotus petals, grey-hued, endued with grace, with a navel"
1436,SECTION XVI.,"depressed, and mighty, Bharata understandeth righteousness, is"
1437,SECTION XVI.,"truth-speaking, of restrained senses (in respect of others’ wives) and"
1438,SECTION XVI.,"also of subdued senses. And he speaketh fair, and is sweet-tempered, and"
1439,SECTION XVI.,"long-armed and the vanquisher of foes. And renouncing various pleasures,"
1440,SECTION XVI.,he hath devoted himself unto the noble one. Thy high-souled brother hath
1441,SECTION XVI.,"secured heaven, since he, resorting to asceticism, is imitating thee"
1442,SECTION XVI.,that resident in the woods. The saying that people follow their mother
1443,SECTION XVI.,"and not their father, is falsified in the case of Bharata. How can"
1444,SECTION XVI.,"mother Kaikeyi, whose husband is Daçaratha and son the righteous"
1445,SECTION XVI.,"Bharata, have such crooked way?"" As the virtuous Lakshmana was speaking"
1446,SECTION XVI.,"thus from affection, Rāghava, not bearing the blame cast upon his mother"
1447,SECTION XVI.,"(Kaikeyi), said, ""My brother, thou shouldst by no means, tax our second"
1448,SECTION XVI.,"mother. Do thou talk of that lord of the Ikshwāku race, Bharata. Albeit"
1449,SECTION XVI.,"my mind is firm as regards my sojourn in the woods, yet is my mind"
1450,SECTION XVI.,"unsteady, being inflamed with affection for Bharata. I remember his dear"
1451,SECTION XVI.,"sweet words, taking the heart, resembling ambrosia, filling the soul"
1452,SECTION XVI.,"with delight. When shall I, O son of Raghu, meet with the high-souled"
1453,SECTION XVI.,"Bharata, and the heroic Satrughna, and thyself?²⁰"" Having bewailed thus,"
1454,SECTION XVI.,"Kākutstha, coming to the river Godavari, there performed his ablutions"
1455,SECTION XVI.,in company with younger brother and Sitā. Then having offered his
1456,SECTION XVI.,"adorations with water unto the gods and the Pitris, those sinless hymned"
1457,SECTION XVI.,the risen sun as well as the celestials. Having with Sitā as the second

1485,SECTION XVII.,And honored of the Maharshis Rāma happily dwelt in that cottage; and
1486,SECTION XVII.,seated with Sitā that mighty-armed one looked like the Moon in

1495,SECTION XVII.,"lotus, and becoming like Kandarpa himself, and resembling Indra, the"
1496,SECTION XVII.,Rākshasi was maddened with desire. Rāma was graced with a beauteous
1497,SECTION XVII.,"countenance, that Rākshas had a hideous face; Rāma had a slender waist,"
1498,SECTION XVII.,"she had a huge abdomen; he had expansive eyes, she had terrible eyes; he"
1499,SECTION XVII.,"was gifted with an elegant head of hair, she had coppery hair; Rāma was"
1500,SECTION XVII.,"of a dear presence, she was of an unsightly presence; Rāma had a"
1501,SECTION XVII.,"sonorous voice, she had a hedeous voice; Rāma was youthful, the Rākshasi"
1502,SECTION XVII.,"was an old hag; Rāma had mellifluous accents, she had harsh accents;"
1503,SECTION XVII.,"Rāma was ever abiding by justice, she was unruly; Rāma was handsome, she"

1525,SECTION XVII.,and the brothers Khara and Dushana renowned in conflict (are also my

1562,SECTION XVIII.,"Thus accosted by the Rākshasi, Sumitri’s son, Lakshmana versed in"

1702,SECTION XX.,"Having said this in wrath, those fourteen Rākshas uplifting their"
1703,SECTION XX.,weapons and daggers rushed towards Rāma and discharged darts at the
1704,SECTION XX.,invincible Rāghava. Thereupon Kākutstha by means of shafts decked with
1705,SECTION XX.,"gold, cut off those fourteen darts of theirs. Seeing this, that"
1706,SECTION XX.,"exceedingly energetic one, waxing highly enraged, took out fourteen"

1708,SECTION XX.,"hurls the thunderbolt, Rāghava drawing his bow and taking his aim at the"
1709,SECTION XX.,"Rākshasas, let go those shafts. And those Rākshasas, their breasts"
1710,SECTION XX.,"pierced with vehemence, and themselves bathed in blood, fell down to the"
1711,SECTION XX.,"earth, like snakes dropping down from an ant hill. And with their"

1738,SECTION XXI.,"irrepressible one, wiping her eyes, spoke unto Khara, ""Having had my"
1739,SECTION XXI.,"nose and ears cut off, I had come hither, covered with blood; and thou"
1740,SECTION XXI.,hadst consoled me. And thou also hadst despatched fourteen heroic
1741,SECTION XXI.,"Rākshasas, for my behoof, for slaying the terrific Rāghava along with"

1743,SECTION XXI.,"and _pathsas_ in their haads, have been slain in conflict by means of"
1744,SECTION XXI.,weapons penetrating into the vitals. Seeing those possessed of great
1745,SECTION XXI.,"speed, in a moment laid low on the ground,—as well as (witnessing)"
1746,SECTION XXI.,"Rāma’s mighty deed, great fear hath taken possession of me. O ranger of"

1750,SECTION XXI.,"alligators and affright for billows? And these Rākshasas, living on"
1751,SECTION XXI.,"flesh who had arrived at that place, have been slain by Rāma with"
1752,SECTION XXI.,sharpened shafts. If thou hast any kindness for me as well as those sons
1753,SECTION XXI.,"of Rākshasas and, O ranger of mght, if thou hast strength and energy to"
1754,SECTION XXI.,"cope with Rāma, do thou kill this thorn of the Rākshasas, who hath set"
1755,SECTION XXI.,up his dwelling in the forest of Dandaka. If thou do not to-day slay
1756,SECTION XXI.,"that destroyer of foes,²⁶ Rāma, I shall banishing shame, give up my life"
1757,SECTION XXI.,"in thy very presence. Meseems, thou backed by thy forces²⁷ art incapable"
1758,SECTION XXI.,of staying in battle before Rāma in high encounter. Thou plumest thyself
1759,SECTION XXI.,on being a hero; but art really none such. Prowess hath been falsely
1760,SECTION XXI.,"attributed unto thee. Go off from Janasthāna without delay, along with"
1761,SECTION XXI.,"thy friends. O Stainer of thy line, do thou in battle slay those"

1802,SECTION XXII.,And thereupon in a passion Khara ascended that car resembling a peak of

1805,SECTION XXII.,"flowers and trees and stones, and the sun and the moon and gold, and"

1808,SECTION XXII.,"beholding that mighty army consisting of cars and arms and pennons,"
1809,SECTION XXII.,"Khara as well as Dushana, said unto that multitude of Rākshasas, ""March"

1812,SECTION XXII.,"with clubs and _pattisas_ and darts and sharpened axes, and scimitars"

1815,SECTION XXII.,"fearful to behold, griped fast. And those following the will of Khara"

1817,SECTION XXII.,"rushing out, Khara’s car remaining a little away (from the press),"

1853,SECTION XXIII.,there appeared evening hued like a cloth soaked in blood. And facing
1854,SECTION XXIII.,"Khara, terrible beasts and birds set up cries. Kankas, Gomayas and"
1855,SECTION XXIII.,"vultures, portending fear, began to cry. Ever inauspicious in war,"
1856,SECTION XXIII.,"jackals presaging evil, with their mouths belching forth flame, howled"
1857,SECTION XXIII.,"in the face of the forces. And comets, resembling _parighas_ appeared"

1859,SECTION XXIII.,was no _parva_. And the winds blew violently; and the sun was without
1860,SECTION XXIII.,"lustre. And when there was no night, stars wearing the sheen of"
1861,SECTION XXIII.,"fireflies, began to fall. And in the tanks fishes and fowls were inert,"
1862,SECTION XXIII.,and the lotuses were withered. And at that hour the trees were shorn of
1863,SECTION XXIII.,fruits and flowers; and without wind there arose dust dusky like clouds.
1864,SECTION XXIII.,And the parrots uttered wild notes—_chichikuchi_. And meteors of
1865,SECTION XXIII.,terrific aspects fell with loud noises. And the earth with her

1867,SECTION XXIII.,"roaring from his car, his left arm shook, and his voice fell, and as he"
1868,SECTION XXIII.,"surveyed around, his eyes moistened, and his head ached; yet through"
1869,SECTION XXIII.,"ignorance, he did not desist. Witnessing these mighty portents capable"

1873,SECTION XXIII.,"dreadful to behold, that have appeared. Even the stars will I bring down"

1885,SECTION XXIII.,"anxious to see the encounter, there came high-souled saints, and"
1886,SECTION XXIII.,"celestials, and Gandharbas, and Siddhas, with the Charānas. And these"

1915,SECTION XXIV.,When Khara of fierce prowess had come to the asylum Rāma in company with
1916,SECTION XXIV.,his brother saw all those evil prognostics. And beholding those dreadful
1917,SECTION XXIV.,"portents, Rāma exceedingly distressed, apprehending some calamity to the"
1918,SECTION XXIV.,"Rākshasas, observed unto Lakshmana, ""O mighty armed one, behold these"
1919,SECTION XXIV.,"great presages that have taken place, capable of annihilating all"
1920,SECTION XXIV.,"beings, and which have for their object the utter extermination of the"
1921,SECTION XXIV.,"Rakhasas! Yonder threatening clouds of assinine sable, showering down"
1922,SECTION XXIV.,"blood and uttering loud sounds are ranging the welkin. And, O discerning"
1923,SECTION XXIV.,"one, rejoicing at the prospect of my fight, all these arrows emit smoke,"
1924,SECTION XXIV.,"and my bows plaited on the back with gold, are restless. Meseems from"
1925,SECTION XXIV.,the noise of the wild birds that impending on us is danger and
1926,SECTION XXIV.,"uncertainty to life. Without doubt, there shall take place a mighty"
1927,SECTION XXIV.,"conflict. At this critical time, my arm shaking momentarily, betokens, O"
1928,SECTION XXIV.,"hero, victory unto us, and defeat unto the enemy. And thy face appeareth"
1929,SECTION XXIV.,"pleasant with a delightful lustre. O Lakshmana, the pallid face of those"
1930,SECTION XXIV.,"that prepare for conflict, auger shortening of life. We can hear the"
1931,SECTION XXIV.,"shouts of the Rākshasas as they roar, as also the blasts of the trumpets"
1932,SECTION XXIV.,of those doomed to be wounded blown by Rākshasas of remorseless deeds. A
1933,SECTION XXIV.,"considerate person that wisheth for his welfare, apprehending peril,"
1934,SECTION XXIV.,should prevent disaster ere it arrives. Therefore bearing arrows in thy
1935,SECTION XXIV.,"hand, and equipped with thy bow, do thou, taking Videha’s daughter, take"
1936,SECTION XXIV.,"refuge in the mountain cavern, covered with trees and difficult of"
1937,SECTION XXIV.,"access. That thou shouldst act contrary to my words, is what I do not"
1938,SECTION XXIV.,"wish. Swearing by my feet, go thou without delay, my brother. Thou art"
1939,SECTION XXIV.,"both strong and a hero: Thou canst, without doubt, slay these"
1940,SECTION XXIV.,"(Rākshasas). But I wish to slay all these rangers of the night myself."""
1941,SECTION XXIV.,"Thus accosted by Rāma, Lakshmana, taking arrows and a bow, took refuge"
1942,SECTION XXIV.,"in an inaccessible cave along with Sitā. Thereupon, saying, ""Ah! we have"
1943,SECTION XXIV.,"spoken it sharp,"" Rāma put on his mail. And adorned with that mail"
1944,SECTION XXIV.,resembling fire Rāma appeared in the dark like a mighty flame streaming
1945,SECTION XXIV.,"up. And uplifting his bow, and taking his arrows, that powerful one"
1946,SECTION XXIV.,"stood there, feeling all directions with the twangs of his bow-string."
1947,SECTION XXIV.,"Then the high-souled gods and Gandharbas, Siddhas and Charanas came"

1949,SECTION XXIV.,"saints of the world, and the foremost Brahmarshis, of pious acts, coming"
1950,SECTION XXIV.,"together, spoke unto one another, saying, ""Hail to cows and Brāhmanas,"
1951,SECTION XXIV.,and all those in whom are established the worlds! May Rāghava vanquish
1952,SECTION XXIV.,"in fight those rangers of the night, the progeny of Pulastya, even as"
1953,SECTION XXIV.,"the discus-handed Vishnu routed in battle the foremost Asuras!"" Having"
1954,SECTION XXIV.,"said this, they again spoke, eying one another, ""There are fourteen"
1955,SECTION XXIV.,"thousand of the Rākshasas of dreadful deeds, while the righteous Rāma is"
1956,SECTION XXIV.,"single. How can fight take place (between two such parties)?"" Having"
1957,SECTION XXIV.,"said this, the Rajarshis, Siddhas, multitudes of the beet of the"
1958,SECTION XXIV.,"twice-born ones, and celestials stationed in the sky were moved with"
1959,SECTION XXIV.,curiosity (as to the issue of the conflict). Then seeing Rāma filled
1960,SECTION XXIV.,"with energy, remaining in the field, all beings from fear experienced"
1961,SECTION XXIV.,great pain. And the peerless grace of Rāma of energetic deeds became
1962,SECTION XXIV.,"like unto that of the high souled infuriated Rudra.³² While the gods,"
1963,SECTION XXIV.,"Gandharbas and Charanas were thus conversing, the forces of the"
1964,SECTION XXIV.,"Rākshasas sending up solemn sounds, furnished with horrible armour, arms"
1965,SECTION XXIV.,"and flags, conversing in heroic parlance, roaring at each other,"
1966,SECTION XXIV.,"stretching bows, momentarily yawning,³³ sending forth shouts, and"
1967,SECTION XXIV.,blowing trumpets. The universal uproar filled that (entire) forest.
1968,SECTION XXIV.,Scared and terrified at the hubbul the rangers of the wood fled to
1969,SECTION XXIV.,quarters free from noise; nor did they cast their eyes backward. And
1970,SECTION XXIV.,"that army resembling the ocean, and rife with sounds, equipped with"
1971,SECTION XXIV.,"various weapons, with furious speed came towards Rāma. And Rāma also"
1972,SECTION XXIV.,"versed in warfare, casting his eyes arround, found the forces of Khara"
1973,SECTION XXIV.,"ready for fight.³⁴ Then stretching his dreadful bow, and swiftly taking"
1974,SECTION XXIV.,"out shafts, (Rāma) for compassing the destruction of the entire body of"
1975,SECTION XXIV.,"the Rākshasas, waxed furiously enraged. And like unto the flaming fire"
1976,SECTION XXIV.,"at the universal dissolution, he, growing wroth, was incapable of being"
1977,SECTION XXIV.,"looked at. And seeing him filled with energy, the sylvan deities were"
1978,SECTION XXIV.,extremely pained.³⁵ And the aspect of the enraged Rāma appeared like
1979,SECTION XXIV.,"that of the holder of Pināka, intent upon destroying Daksha’s sacrifice."
1980,SECTION XXIV.,"Furnished with bows and ornaments and cars and mail hued like fire, that"

1999,SECTION XXV.,"Coming to the asylum, Khara in company with those that went before him,"
2000,SECTION XXV.,"saw that slayer of foes, the enraged Rāma, holding his bow. And seeing"
2001,SECTION XXV.,"him, Khara possessing a shrill voice, raising his bow, commanded unto"
2002,SECTION XXV.,"the charioteer to drive towards Rāma,—"" Drive on!"" At Khara’s command,"
2003,SECTION XXV.,the charioteer drove the steeds to where the mighty-armed Rāma stood
2004,SECTION XXV.,"alone, holding his bow. And seeing him (Khara) entered the field, all"
2005,SECTION XXV.,"those rangers of the night—the counselors—uttering mighty shouts,"
2006,SECTION XXV.,environed him round. And Khara stationed on his car in the midst of
2007,SECTION XXV.,Rākshasas appeared like red bodied one risen in the midst of the stars.
2008,SECTION XXV.,"Then in battle Khara, afflicting Rāma of incomparable energy with a"

2010,SECTION XXV.,"night, waxing exceeding wroth, showered various weapons on that terrible"
2011,SECTION XXV.,"bowman, the invincible Rāma. And wrought up with rage, the Rākshasas in"
2012,SECTION XXV.,"battle assailed him with iron clubs, and darts, and _prāsas_, and"
2013,SECTION XXV.,"swords, and axes. And resembling clouds (in hue), the exceedingly strong"
2014,SECTION XXV.,"Rākshasas, having huge bodies, darted towards Kākutstha by means of"
2015,SECTION XXV.,"steeds and cars. And mounted on elephants resembling mountain-peaks,"
2016,SECTION XXV.,"numbers of Rākshasas, intent upon slaying Rāma in battle, showered"
2017,SECTION XXV.,"arrows on him, as mighty clouds pour down showers on the monarch of"
2018,SECTION XXV.,mountains. And Rāma was hemmed in by all those fierce-looking Rākshasas
2019,SECTION XXV.,even as in the evening Mahādeva is surrounded by his courtiers. And as
2020,SECTION XXV.,"the ocean resisteth the tide of a river, Rāghava by means of arrows"
2021,SECTION XXV.,"resisted the weapons discharged by the Yatudhānas. As a mighty mountain,"
2022,SECTION XXV.,"assailed by the thunderbolt, doth not feel pain, Rāma, having his person"
2023,SECTION XXV.,"pierced by terrible flaming weapons, did not feel pain. And pierced, and"
2024,SECTION XXV.,"with his person covered with blood, Rāma, the descendant of Raghu,"
2025,SECTION XXV.,"resembled the sun enveloped in evening clouds. And seeing him single,"
2026,SECTION XXV.,"surrounded by many thousands, the Gods, Gandharbas, Siddhas, and supreme"
2027,SECTION XXV.,"saints became sorrowful. Then Rāma getting enraged, bringing his bow to"
2028,SECTION XXV.,"a circle, discharged sharpened shafts by hundreds and by thousands. And"
2029,SECTION XXV.,"as if in sport, Rāma in the conflict shot irrisistible (shafts)"
2030,SECTION XXV.,"furnished with Kanka feathers, and decked with gold, irrisistible,"
2031,SECTION XXV.,"capable of inflicting extreme pain, and resembling the noose of Death."
2032,SECTION XXV.,"And sportively discharged by Rāma, those arrows deprived the Rākshasas"
2033,SECTION XXV.,"of their lives, like the noose forged by death. And piercing the persons"
2034,SECTION XXV.,"of the Rākshasas, those arrows, soaked in blood, going up to the sky,"
2035,SECTION XXV.,"appeared with the splendour of flaming fire. And innumerable shafts,"
2036,SECTION XXV.,"exceedingly fierce, capable of depriving the Rākshasas of their lives,"
2037,SECTION XXV.,were let go from the circle of his bow. And with those Rāma severed
2038,SECTION XXV.,"bows, in battle by hundreds and by thousands and flag ends, and shields,"
2039,SECTION XXV.,"and mail, and many arms with embellished hands, resembling the trunks of"
2040,SECTION XXV.,elephants. And the arrows of Rāma discharged from the string pierced and
2041,SECTION XXV.,"cut off steeds mailed in gold, yoked unto cars, together with the"
2042,SECTION XXV.,charioteer; and elephants with their riders; and horsemen with horses.
2043,SECTION XXV.,"And slaying foot-soldiers, he despatched them to the abode of Yama. And"
2044,SECTION XXV.,"cut off with _nālikas_ and, _nārāchas_, and sharp-pointed _vikirnas_,"
2045,SECTION XXV.,the rangers of the night uttered dreadful howls of distress. And like a
2046,SECTION XXV.,"withered wood afflicted by fire, that host harassed by the various"
2047,SECTION XXV.,"marrow-piercing³⁶ shafts shot by Rāma, did not attain ease. And some"
2048,SECTION XXV.,"heroic rangers of the night possessed of great strength, waxing furious,"
2049,SECTION XXV.,"threw³⁷ at Rāma _prasas_, and darts and axes. Thereupon resisting by"
2050,SECTION XXV.,"means of shafts those weapons of theirs, the mighty-armed Rāma endeued"
2051,SECTION XXV.,"with prowess, took their lives in the conflict, and cut off the heads"
2052,SECTION XXV.,"(of warriors). And having their heads, and shields and bow-strings,"
2053,SECTION XXV.,"severed, they fell as fall on the earth trees thrown down by blasts from"
2054,SECTION XXV.,"the wings of Suparna.³⁸ Those rangers of the night that remained there,"
2055,SECTION XXV.,"wounded by arrows, and losing heart, fled with speed to Khara, to seek"
2056,SECTION XXV.,"his protection. Thereat, encouraging them, Dushana, taking his bow, ran"
2057,SECTION XXV.,"furiously in high rage against Rāma, like the enraged Destroyer himself."
2058,SECTION XXV.,"And rallied again (by Dushana) and, their fear dispelled through their"
2059,SECTION XXV.,"having found refuge with him, they armed with _sālas_, _tālas_, and"
2060,SECTION XXV.,"crags, darted against Rāma. And bearing in their hands darts, and clubs,"
2061,SECTION XXV.,"and nooses, those exceedingly strong ones showered in battle shafts and"
2062,SECTION XXV.,weapons. And the Rākshasas discharged vollies of trees and crags. And
2063,SECTION XXV.,"capable of making one’s hair stand on end, that battle was dreadful and"
2064,SECTION XXV.,furious and now on the side of Rāma and now again on that of the
2065,SECTION XXV.,"Rākshasas. And waxing exceedingly wroth, they bore on him hard from all"
2066,SECTION XXV.,"sides. Then finding all directions entirely covered with Rākshasas, and"
2067,SECTION XXV.,"showers of shafts, that one gifted with mighty strength, sending up a"
2068,SECTION XXV.,"terrific shout, fixed (on the bow-string) the exceedingly effulgent"
2069,SECTION XXV.,Gandharba weapon (for discharging it) among the Rākshasas. Then
2070,SECTION XXV.,thousands of shafts went forth from the circle of his bow; and all
2071,SECTION XXV.,"directions were covered with thronging arrows. And those Rākshasas,"
2072,SECTION XXV.,afflicted with arrows could not see Rāma how he took out his dread
2073,SECTION XXV.,"shafts, nor how he discharged those excellent shafts; they only saw him"
2074,SECTION XXV.,drawing his bow. And the darkness spread by the arrows enveloped the sky
2075,SECTION XXV.,with the sun. And Rāma stationed there continued pouring in shafts. And
2076,SECTION XXV.,"the earth was covered with shafts shot, and alighting, and alighted"
2077,SECTION XXV.,"simultaneously. And at places were seen Rākshasas by thousands slain,"
2078,SECTION XXV.,"falling, enfeebled, torn and riven. And cut off by Rāma with arrows,"
2079,SECTION XXV.,"darts and _Patticas_ in that battle the fearful field was scattered,"
2080,SECTION XXV.,"heads with turbans, arms with finger-fences; torn thighs and arms, and"
2081,SECTION XXV.,"various ornaments, horses, excellent elephants and cars, shattered in"
2082,SECTION XXV.,"numbers, chouris, fans, and umbrellas, and pennons of various"

2102,SECTION XXVI.,"all sides they incessantly showered darts and _patticas_, and scimitars,"
2103,SECTION XXVI.,"stones, and trees, and shafts. Thereupon by means of shafts the"
2104,SECTION XXVI.,righteous Rāghava resisted that mighty destructive shower of trees and
2105,SECTION XXVI.,"stones. Resisting that shower, Rāma with his eyes staring, and"
2106,SECTION XXVI.,"resembling a bull, flew into a great rage, for the purpose of slaying"
2107,SECTION XXVI.,"the whole body of Rākshasas. Then influenced by wrath, and flaming in"
2108,SECTION XXVI.,energy he on all sides covered the army along with Dushana with arrows.
2109,SECTION XXVI.,"Then the general, Dushana, destroyer of enemies, getting wroth, opposed"
2110,SECTION XXVI.,Rāghava with arrows resembling thunderbolts. Then heroic Rāma highly
2111,SECTION XXVI.,"angered, severed his (Dushana’s) mighty bow with shafts sharp as razors,"
2112,SECTION XXVI.,and slew his four horses by means of as many shafts. And having slain
2113,SECTION XXVI.,"the steeds, he (Rāma) cut off the head of the charioteer by means of a"
2114,SECTION XXVI.,"crescent-shaped weapon, and pierced the (Rākshasa Dushna) in the breast"
2115,SECTION XXVI.,"with a brace of shafts. His bow cut off, his steeds together with the"
2116,SECTION XXVI.,"charioteer slain, and himself deprived of his car, he (Dushana) took a"
2117,SECTION XXVI.,"_parigha_ resembling a mountain peak, able to make one’s down stand on"
2118,SECTION XXVI.,"end plated with gold, capable of afflicting celestial hosts, studded"
2119,SECTION XXVI.,"with sharp iron _sankus_, and graced with the fat of foes;—of the touch"

2121,SECTION XXVI.,"in that encounter the _parigha_ resembling a mighty snake, that ranger"
2122,SECTION XXVI.,"of the night of cruel deeds Dushana, rushed towards Rāma. And as Dushana"
2123,SECTION XXVI.,"was rushing forward, Rāghava by means of a couple of shafts cut off his"
2124,SECTION XXVI.,two arms with the ornaments. And the huge _parigha_ escaping from
2125,SECTION XXVI.,(Dushana’s grasp) fell forward on the field like the banner of Sakra.
2126,SECTION XXVI.,"And like a mighty elephant whose husks have fallen off, Dushana, on his"
2127,SECTION XXVI.,"arms having been severed, fell down to the earth. Seeing Dushana down on"
2128,SECTION XXVI.,"the ground, and slain in battle, all creatures, saying, ""well done!"""
2129,SECTION XXVI.,"""well done!"" paid homage unto Kākutstha. In the meantime, three"
2130,SECTION XXVI.,"generals, getting wroth, being entrapped in the noose of death, rushed"
2131,SECTION XXVI.,"against Rāma in a body—viz; Mahākapāla, Sthulākshya, and the mighty"
2132,SECTION XXVI.,"Pramāthi the Rākshasa, Mahākapāla, upraising a large dart, and"
2133,SECTION XXVI.,"Sthulākshya, taking a _pathica_, and Pramāthi, an axe. And as soon as"
2134,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāghava beheld them advance, he resisted them by means of sharp and"
2135,SECTION XXVI.,"keen-edged shafts, even as one receives guests that have come. And"
2136,SECTION XXVI.,"Raghu’s son split Mahākapāla’s head,—afflicted Pramāthi with countless"
2137,SECTION XXVI.,"shafts, and lodged the eyes of Sthulākshya with sharp shafts. And they"
2138,SECTION XXVI.,fell down to the earth like mighty trees of many boughs. Thereat
2139,SECTION XXVI.,"instantly inflamed with wrath, Rāma by means of five thousand shafts,"
2140,SECTION XXVI.,sent as many thousands of Dushana’s followers to Yama’s abode. Hearing
2141,SECTION XXVI.,"that Dushana had been slain, Khara, waxing wroth, commanded his mighty"
2142,SECTION XXVI.,"generals, saying, ""Fighting with that vile man, Rāma, along with his"
2143,SECTION XXVI.,"mighty forces Dushana hath been slain in battle, together with his"
2144,SECTION XXVI.,followers. Let all the Rākshasas slay him with weapons of various
2145,SECTION XXVI.,"shapes."" Having said this in wrath, Khara darted towards Rāma. And"
2146,SECTION XXVI.,"discharging choice shafts, Syenagāmi Prithugriva, Jajnasatru, Vihangama,"
2147,SECTION XXVI.,"Durjaya, Paravirāksha, Parusha, Kālakārmuka, Hemamāli, Mahāmāli,"
2148,SECTION XXVI.,"Sarpāsya, and Rudhirāçana,—these twelve generals endeued with mighty"
2149,SECTION XXVI.,"prowess accompanied with their forces, proceeded vehemently against"
2150,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāma, discharging excellent shafts. Threat with shafts resembling fire,"
2151,SECTION XXVI.,"and decked with diamonds and with gold, (Rāma) possessed of energy"
2152,SECTION XXVI.,destroyed the rest of his (Khara’s) forces. And as the thunderbolt
2153,SECTION XXVI.,"slayeth the mighty, Asuras, those shafts studded with gold, and like"
2154,SECTION XXVI.,"onto smoking fire, slew those Rākshasas. And in in the field Rāma slew"
2155,SECTION XXVI.,"an hundred Rākshasa with an hundred Karnis, and a thousand (again) with"
2156,SECTION XXVI.,"a thousand. And, their armour and ornaments severed, and their bows"
2157,SECTION XXVI.,"broken in shivers, those rangers of the night fell down on the earth,"
2158,SECTION XXVI.,"bathed in blood. And as a spacious dais is covered with Kuça, the entire"
2159,SECTION XXVI.,field was scattered with the Rākshasas fallen in battle with hair
2160,SECTION XXVI.,"dishevelled, and covered with blood. And at that time that fearful"
2161,SECTION XXVI.,"forest, with the Rākshasas slaughtered, and with its clay mired with"
2162,SECTION XXVI.,"flesh and blood, resembled hell itself. Fourteen thousand Rākshasas of"
2163,SECTION XXVI.,"dreadful deeds were slain by Rāma single, a human being, fighting,"
2164,SECTION XXVI.,(moreover) on foot. And the remnant of his (Khara’s) forces were that
2165,SECTION XXVI.,"mighty car-warrior, Khara himself, and the Rākshasa, Triçira; and (on"
2166,SECTION XXVI.,the other side) was that destroyer of foes—Rāma. The rest of the
2167,SECTION XXVI.,"Rākshasas, gifted with great prowess, terrible and difficult of being"
2168,SECTION XXVI.,"withstood, were all slain in battle by The dear brother of Lakshmana."
2169,SECTION XXVI.,Then seeing that dreadful army destroyed in terrible conflict by the
2170,SECTION XXVI.,"mighty Rāma, Khara ascending a great car, advanced before Rāma, like"
2171,SECTION XXVI.,Indra with the upraised thunderbolt.

2182,SECTION XXVII.,prowess; and thyself desist from this rashness. Behold the mighty-armed
2183,SECTION XXVII.,Rāma brought down in battle. I swear (unto thee) truly; I touch this
2184,SECTION XXVII.,"weapon, (to say) that I will slay Rāma, who deserves to be slain by all"
2185,SECTION XXVII.,"the Rākshasas. Either I shall prove his death in battle, or he shall"
2186,SECTION XXVII.,"prove mine. Restraining thy martial ardour, do thou for a while become a"

2188,SECTION XXVII.,"repair unto Janasthāna; or I being slain, thou shalt enter the field"
2189,SECTION XXVII.,"(against him)."" Thus satisfied by Triçara, from his desire to meet with"
2190,SECTION XXVII.,"death, the latter, on being permitted with ""Go,"" proceeded towards Rāma."
2191,SECTION XXVII.,"And like a hill with three summits, Triçira rushed towards Rāma on an"
2192,SECTION XXVII.,effulgent car yoked with steeds. And as a mighty cloud pours down
2193,SECTION XXVII.,"shower, (Triçira) discharging vollies of shafts, uttered a roar"
2194,SECTION XXVII.,resembling the sound of a wet kettledrum. And seeing that the Rākshasa
2195,SECTION XXVII.,"Triçira was advancing, Rāghava resisted (his attack) by discharging"
2196,SECTION XXVII.,"sharpened shafts. And that encounter of those exceedingly powerful ones,"
2197,SECTION XXVII.,"Rāma and Triçira was fierce, like unto that between a lion and an"
2198,SECTION XXVII.,elephant. Then struck on the forehead by a brace of shafts shot by
2199,SECTION XXVII.,"Triçira, the wrathful Rāma enraged, and inflamed with anger, said, ""Ah!"
2200,SECTION XXVII.,such is the strength of the heroic Rākshasas! I have been wounded in the
2201,SECTION XXVII.,forehead with shafts resembling flowers. Do thou also take the arrows
2202,SECTION XXVII.,"shot from my bow."" Saying this, (Rāma) enraged, and influenced by wrath,"
2203,SECTION XXVII.,wounded Triçira in the breast with fourteen arrows. And that energetic
2204,SECTION XXVII.,"one by means of four shafts having their joints bent, brought down his"
2205,SECTION XXVII.,four steeds. And by means of eight arrows (Rāma) laid low the charioteer
2206,SECTION XXVII.,from the front of the car. And Rāma with a shaft severed his upraised
2207,SECTION XXVII.,standard. Then as that ranger of the night was descending from his
2208,SECTION XXVII.,"broken car, Rāma pierced his breast with arrows,—and thereat he was"
2209,SECTION XXVII.,"stupified. Thereupon, that one of immeasurable prowess, out of anger by"
2210,SECTION XXVII.,"means of three shafts possessed of celerity, brought down Triçira’s"
2211,SECTION XXVII.,"three heads. And that ranger of the night present in the field,"

2226,SECTION XXVIII.,"Rākshasa host—even Dushana and Triçira—slain by the mighty Rāma alone,"
2227,SECTION XXVIII.,"and seeing the great courage that was made in the army, that Rākshasa,"
2228,SECTION XXVIII.,"Khara, was seized with despondency. Then as Namuchi advances against"
2229,SECTION XXVIII.,"Vāsava, Khara stretching his powerful bow, advanced against Rāma. And"
2230,SECTION XXVIII.,"Khara hurled at Rāma nārāchas reveling in blood, resembling infuriated"
2231,SECTION XXVIII.,"venomous snakes. And repeatedly twanging his bow, Khara, mounted on his"
2232,SECTION XXVIII.,"car, began to range the field, displaying his weapons through his"
2233,SECTION XXVIII.,acquired skill. And that mighty car-warrior covered all sides with his
2234,SECTION XXVIII.,"shafts. And seeing this, Rāma of a tremendous bow with shafts incapable"
2235,SECTION XXVIII.,"of being borne, and resembling tongues of flaming fire, entirely"
2236,SECTION XXVIII.,"enveloped the welkin, even as a cloud poureth down showers. And with the"
2237,SECTION XXVIII.,"sharpened shafts shot by Khara and Rāma, the entire firmament on all"
2238,SECTION XXVIII.,sides was thronged. And as each enraged was engaged in coping with the
2239,SECTION XXVIII.,"other, the sun, enveloped in a net-work of shafts, did not appear. And"
2240,SECTION XXVIII.,"as a mighty elephant is struck with the goad, Rāma in the conflict"
2241,SECTION XXVIII.,attacked (his opponent) with _nālikas_ and _nārāchas_ and sharp-pointed
2242,SECTION XXVIII.,"_vikirna_. And as that Rākshasa sat on his car, bow in hand, all"
2243,SECTION XXVIII.,"creatures saw him, as if he were the very Destroyer with the noose in"
2244,SECTION XXVIII.,his hand. And at this time Khara thought that Destroyer of all his
2245,SECTION XXVIII.,"forces, established in his manliness, the exceedingly powerful Rāma to"
2246,SECTION XXVIII.,"be overcome with fatigue. And seeing that one powerful like the lion,"
2247,SECTION XXVIII.,"and gifted with the vigorous gait of the lion, Rāma was not moved, as a"
2248,SECTION XXVIII.,lion seeing a puny deer (is not moved). And then as an insect falls into
2249,SECTION XXVIII.,"a flame, Khara mounting a mighty car, resembling the sun, approached"
2250,SECTION XXVIII.,"Rāma. And, displaying his lightness of hand, Khara severed the bow of"
2251,SECTION XXVIII.,"the magnanimous Rāma, with the arrow (fixed on it) at the place where it"
2252,SECTION XXVIII.,"is grasped. Then taking up seven other shafts, resplendent like the"
2253,SECTION XXVIII.,"thunderbolt of Sakra, Khara, enraged, sent them into (Rāma’s)"
2254,SECTION XXVIII.,"main-joints, and then afflicting Rāma of unparalleled energy with a"
2255,SECTION XXVIII.,"thousand shafts, Khara sent up in that conflict a loud shout. And riven"
2256,SECTION XXVIII.,"by the shafts discharged by Khara, Rāma’s mail resembling the sun fell"
2257,SECTION XXVIII.,"to the ground. And pierced with those arrows, all over his body, and"
2258,SECTION XXVIII.,"inflamed with rage, Rāghava appeared in the field, like a smokeless"
2259,SECTION XXVIII.,"flaming fire. Then that destroyer of foes, Rāma, for compassing the end"
2260,SECTION XXVIII.,"of his enemy, stringed another mighty bow, sending forth solemn"
2261,SECTION XXVIII.,"sounds,—the redoubtable Vaishnava bow that had been conferred on him by"
2262,SECTION XXVIII.,"the Maharshi. And uplifting that superior bow, Rāma rushed against"
2263,SECTION XXVIII.,"Khara. Then with shafts having bent knots and golden feathers, Rāma,"
2264,SECTION XXVIII.,"wrought up with rage, severed in battle Khara’s standard. And on that"
2265,SECTION XXVIII.,exceedingly graceful golden standard being hewn down it seemed as if the
2266,SECTION XXVIII.,sun dropped to the earth at the behest of the celestials. And thereat
2267,SECTION XXVIII.,"Khara, understanding the import of things, fired with wrath, pierced"
2268,SECTION XXVIII.,"Rāma’s breast with five arrows, like one striking an elephant with a"
2269,SECTION XXVIII.,goad. And Rāma on being pierced with a good many shafts discharged from
2270,SECTION XXVIII.,"Khara’s bow, and having his body bathed in blood, was highly wroth."

2388,SECTION XXX.,"field, Khara from wrath, with accents rendered harsher, fell to"
2389,SECTION XXX.,"censuring (Rāma). ""Thou art wondrous proud: and thou art fearless albeit"

2396,SECTION XXX.,"looking about him on all sides in the field for a weapon, he uprooted"

2398,SECTION XXX.,"uttering a roar, that exceedingly powerful one aiming at Rāma discharged"
2399,SECTION XXX.,"it, exclaiming,—""Dead thou art."" And as it descended, the puissant Rāma"
2400,SECTION XXX.,"cut it off by means of a multitude of shafts, got into a mighty rage for"
2401,SECTION XXX.,"the purpose of slaying Khara in battle. Then Rāma perspiring, with eyes"
2402,SECTION XXX.,"reddened in wrath, pierced Khara in battle with a thousand shafts. And"
2403,SECTION XXX.,"blood mixed with froth gushed by the sides of the shafts, like torrents"
2404,SECTION XXX.,flowing from fountain in a hill⁴⁴ stupified in battle by the shafts shot
2405,SECTION XXX.,"by Rāma, and maddened by the smell of blood, Khara furiously made for"
2406,SECTION XXX.,"Rāma. And as he (Khara) was rushing on, bathed with blood, Rāma equipped"
2407,SECTION XXX.,"with arms, suddenly summoning his strength walked backward two or three"
2408,SECTION XXX.,paces. Then with the view of bringing about (Khara’s end) Rāma took up
2409,SECTION XXX.,in the conflict an arrow resembling fire or another weapon of Brahmā
2410,SECTION XXX.,"himself. And that righteous one shot at Khara that (arrow), which had"
2411,SECTION XXX.,been conferred on him by the intelligent Maghavān. And discharged by
2412,SECTION XXX.,Rāma from his bent bow that mighty arrow with the roaring of the
2413,SECTION XXX.,thunderbolt fell at Khara’ s breast. And burning in the fire of the
2414,SECTION XXX.,"arrow, Khara fell down on the earth, like the giant Andhaka⁴⁵ in the"
2415,SECTION XXX.,"forest of Sweta, consumed by Rudra. And threat Khara slain fell down"
2416,SECTION XXX.,"like Vritra slain by the thunder-bolt, or Namuchi by foam,⁴⁶ or Vala by"
2417,SECTION XXX.,"Indra’s _Acani_. After this, the celestials, assembled with the"

2419,SECTION XXX.,"blossoms on Rāma. ""In over half a moment Rāma by means of sharpened"

2425,SECTION XXX.,"with supreme saints, with Agastya (at their head), gladly paying homage"
2426,SECTION XXX.,"unto Rāma, said the following words, ""It is for this that the chastiser"

2478,SECTION XXXI.,"sable-hued, of high fame, and of matchless prowess and vigor. It is he"

2483,SECTION XXXI.,"body of the immortals? Again hearing Rāvana’s words, Akampana described"
2484,SECTION XXXI.,"the strength and energy of that high-souled one. (He) is named Rāma, and"
2485,SECTION XXXI.,is exceedingly energetic; the foremost of all bowmen— furnished with
2486,SECTION XXXI.,celestial panoply; and is possessed of pre-eminent prowess in warfare.

2495,SECTION XXXI.,"the Rākshasas go, they see Rāma stationed before them. In this way, O"

2517,SECTION XXXI.,"his wife. Without Sitā, Rāma shall cease to exist."" Thereupon, the lord"
2518,SECTION XXXI.,"of the Rākshasas, Rāvana, happened to relish those words; and reflecting"
2519,SECTION XXXI.,"(a while), that mighty-armed one addressed Akampana, saying, ""Excellent"

2521,SECTION XXXI.,this very morning with a glad heart bring Vaidehi to this spacious
2522,SECTION XXXI.,"palace."" Saying this, Rāvana departed, lighting up all sides, on a"
2523,SECTION XXXI.,"sun-shiny car, yoked with mules. And coursing the firmament, that mighty"
2524,SECTION XXXI.,car of that foremost of Rākshasas looked like the Moon among clouds. And
2525,SECTION XXXI.,"proceeding far, he, approaching the asylum (of Taraka’s son), presented"
2526,SECTION XXXI.,himself before him. And Māricha entertained the king with meats and
2527,SECTION XXXI.,drinks passing human. And having entertained him personally with a seat
2528,SECTION XXXI.,"and water (to wash the feet), Māricha spoke these pregnant words, ""O"
2529,SECTION XXXI.,"king, O lord of the Rākshasas, is it well with the worlds? I am filled"
2530,SECTION XXXI.,"with fear: I apprehend that all is not right, since thou hast come"
2531,SECTION XXXI.,"hither (alone) in such post-haste speed."" Thus addressed by Māricha, the"
2532,SECTION XXXI.,"highly energetic Rāvana, versed in speech, said, ""My child, the guards"
2533,SECTION XXXI.,(of Janasthāna) have been slain by Rāma of untiring energy; and all
2534,SECTION XXXI.,"Janasthāna, incapable of being slain, hath (by him) been brought down in"
2535,SECTION XXXI.,"battle. Do thou, therefore, assist me in carrying away his wife."""
2536,SECTION XXXI.,"Hearing these words of the lord of Rākshasas, Māricha said, ""What enemy"
2537,SECTION XXXI.,"of thine in the guise of a friend, hath spoken of Sitā unto thee? And, O"
2538,SECTION XXXI.,"foremost of monarchs, who, having been, entertained by thee, doth not"
2539,SECTION XXXI.,"bear thee good will?⁴⁸ Tell me, who is it that hath told thee, ’Bring"
2540,SECTION XXXI.,Sitā hither?’ Who is it that hath set his heart on severing the summit
2541,SECTION XXXI.,of the entire Rākshasa world? He must be thy enemy that excites thee to
2542,SECTION XXXI.,this. Of this there is not the least doubt. He wishes to extract through
2543,SECTION XXXI.,thy agency the fangs of a venomous snake. Who (intends) to lead thee
2544,SECTION XXXI.,"astray by imposing on thee such a deed? Who, king, hath struck in the"
2545,SECTION XXXI.,"head, thee that wast slumbering in peace? Rāghava in war is like a mad"
2546,SECTION XXXI.,"elephant, having an unblemished ancestry for his trunk, perspiration for"
2547,SECTION XXXI.,his temporal exudation; and arms resting well beside him for his tusks.
2548,SECTION XXXI.,"O Rāvana, thou art not competent even to look at him. Thou ought not to"
2549,SECTION XXXI.,"rouse up the sleeping man-lion, that slayer of skillful Rākshasas"
2550,SECTION XXXI.,"resembling deer, with his sport in the field, for his joints and down;"
2551,SECTION XXXI.,arrows for his body and sharp scimitar for his teeth. O Sovereign of the
2552,SECTION XXXI.,"Rākshasas, thou ought not to plunge thyself into this dreadful, and"
2553,SECTION XXXI.,"abysslesss ocean, having the bow for its alligators, activity of arms"
2554,SECTION XXXI.,"for its shine, arrows for its billows, and engagement for its waters. Be"
2555,SECTION XXXI.,"propitious, O lord of Lankā! O foremost of Rākshasas, with a contented"
2556,SECTION XXXI.,"heart, thou hadst better go thy way to Lankā. Do thou ever sport with"
2557,SECTION XXXI.,"thy own wives: let Rāma in company with his wife, sport in the woods."""
2558,SECTION XXXI.,"Thus addressed by Māricha, the ten-throated Rāvana desisted, and entered"

2612,SECTION XXXII.,nature; the slaughterer of Brāhmanas; of cruel deeds; harsh and
2613,SECTION XXXII.,"kindless, and ever bent on doing evil unto all creatures; and railing"
2614,SECTION XXXII.,furiously at all creatures; the inspirer of fear in all beings. And the
2615,SECTION XXXII.,"Rākshasi beheld her exceedingly powerful and cruel brother, wearing"

2617,SECTION XXXII.,"garland,—seated, like the Destroyer at the time (of dissolution) ready"
2618,SECTION XXXII.,(to destroy); the exalted chief of Rākshasas; the delight of the race of

2637,SECTION XXXIII.,"without any control whatever, thou dost not see that a dreadful disaster"
2638,SECTION XXXIII.,is impending. The subjects do not esteem a monarch that is given to
2639,SECTION XXXIII.,"sensual enjoyments, is intent upon satisfying his lust and is covetous"
2640,SECTION XXXIII.,like the fire in a cemetery. The king that doth not act at the proper
2641,SECTION XXXIII.,"time, finds destruction along with his kingdom and acts. Even as"
2642,SECTION XXXIII.,"elephants shun the muddy river, do people shun from a distance, the"
2643,SECTION XXXIII.,"ruler that doth not send out spies, who showeth not himself (unto his"
2644,SECTION XXXIII.,"subjects), and who hath lost his independence. Like unto rocks in the"
2645,SECTION XXXIII.,"sea, those monarchs that do not administer their dominions, that are not"
2646,SECTION XXXIII.,"dependent, do not prosper. Having incurred the hostility of the gods,"
2647,SECTION XXXIII.,"the Dānavas and the Gandharbas of subdued souls and senses, how canst"
2648,SECTION XXXIII.,"thou, who art fickle, and hast not employed spies, become the king? And,"
2649,SECTION XXXIII.,"O Rākshasa, thou art childish and foolish; and doth not know what thou"
2650,SECTION XXXIII.,shouldst. How canst thou then become the king? O thou best of
2651,SECTION XXXIII.,"conquerers, those kings whose spies, exchequer and morality are not"
2652,SECTION XXXIII.,"free, are like the common herd. It is because kings know distant dangers"
2653,SECTION XXXIII.,"through spies, therefore they are styled far-sighted. I believe thou"
2654,SECTION XXXIII.,"hast no spies, and that thy counsellors are common folks, since although"
2655,SECTION XXXIII.,"Janasthāna with thy kinsman is destroyed, yet thou takest it not to"
2656,SECTION XXXIII.,"heart. Fourteen thousands of Rākshasas of dreadful deeds, with Khara and"
2657,SECTION XXXIII.,"Dushana, have all been slain by Rāma single-handed; Rāma of untiring"
2658,SECTION XXXIII.,energy hath inspired the saints with courage; the Dandakas have been
2659,SECTION XXXIII.,"benefitted; and Janasthāna hath been harassed. But thou, covetous and"
2660,SECTION XXXIII.,"intoxicated and in the power of others, dost not understand that a great"
2661,SECTION XXXIII.,danger is overhanging (thee). People do not in times of peril assist a
2662,SECTION XXXIII.,"sovereign that is wrathful, stingy, intoxicated, haughty and deceitful."
2663,SECTION XXXIII.,Even his own kindred slay a sovereign that sets inmense store by his own
2664,SECTION XXXIII.,"self, is of light worth, regards himself highly, and irascible. They do"
2665,SECTION XXXIII.,not serve him; nor do they fear when he intimidates them. Such an one is
2666,SECTION XXXIII.,speedily dethroned; and reduced to poverty and becomes like a straw.
2667,SECTION XXXIII.,"Even dry wood may serve a purpose; or stone, or dust; but no purpose is"
2668,SECTION XXXIII.,capable of being served by a sovereign that hath been cast off his

2670,SECTION XXXIII.,"trodden, a king that hath been dethroned, although able, is of no"
2671,SECTION XXXIII.,"consequence. But a king that keeps his wits about him, understands"
2672,SECTION XXXIII.,"everything, is of controlled senses, and grateful, and of virtuous"
2673,SECTION XXXIII.,"character, endureth for ever. That king is honored by men, that sleeping"
2674,SECTION XXXIII.,"with his eyes, is awake as respects his eye of duty, and (the effects"
2675,SECTION XXXIII.,"of) whose anger and favor, are seen (by all). But, thou Rāvana, who hast"
2676,SECTION XXXIII.,"not by means of spies, acquainted thyself with the slaughter of"
2677,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rākshasas, art of evil understanding and bereft of all these virtues,"
2678,SECTION XXXIII.,"given to disgracing others, ignorant of the proper distribution of time"
2679,SECTION XXXIII.,"and place,⁵⁰ and never taking care to distinguish merits and defects,"
2680,SECTION XXXIII.,"thou, thy kingdom being in danger, wilt speedily meet with disaster."" On"
2681,SECTION XXXIII.,"his vices having been thus celebrated by her (Surpanakhā), that lord of"

2698,SECTION XXXIV.,"battle, and Dushana and Triçira. Do thou, O thou of a pleasing person,"
2699,SECTION XXXIV.,"tell me the truth. And who hath deformed thee?"" Thus addressed by the"
2700,SECTION XXXIV.,"lord of the Rākshasas, the Rākshasi, transported with rage, commenced to"
2701,SECTION XXXIV.,"duly narrate all about Rāma. ""Rāma the son of Daçaratha is long-armed,"
2702,SECTION XXXIV.,"of expansive eyes, clad in bark and dark deer-skin, and like Kandarpa in"
2703,SECTION XXXIV.,"grace. And drawing a bow resembling that of Sakra, decked with golden"
2704,SECTION XXXIV.,"rings, he discharges blazing _nārachas_, like unto serpents of virulent"
2705,SECTION XXXIV.,"poison. I do not see in the field, Rāma drawing his bow: I only see the"
2706,SECTION XXXIV.,host being slaughtered by a shower of shafts. And as Indra destroys (a
2707,SECTION XXXIV.,"field of) goodly crops, by pouring down hail stones, fourteen thousand"
2708,SECTION XXXIV.,"Rākshasas of dreadful prowess, as well as Khara and Dushana were in a"
2709,SECTION XXXIV.,little over a moment slain with sharp shafts by Rāma alone fighting on
2710,SECTION XXXIV.,"foot. And he hath reassured the saints, and after having been deformed,"
2711,SECTION XXXIV.,"I alone from fear of slaying a woman, have been let off by the"
2712,SECTION XXXIV.,high-souled Rāma knowing self. His brother is endeued with mighty
2713,SECTION XXXIV.,"energy, and in merit, is of equal prowess; and he is devoted to his"
2714,SECTION XXXIV.,"brother, and beareth him regard; the puissant one is named Lakshmana."
2715,SECTION XXXIV.,"And wrathful and invincible and victorious, and powerful, and"
2716,SECTION XXXIV.,"intelligent and mighty, (he) is Rāma’s right-arm—his life ranging"
2717,SECTION XXXIV.,"externally. And Rāma’s virtuously wedded beloved wife, having expansive"
2718,SECTION XXXIV.,"eyes, and a face resembling the full-moon, is ever to the welfare of her"
2719,SECTION XXXIV.,"lord. And that fair-haired, fair-nosed, and fair-thighed illustrious one"
2720,SECTION XXXIV.,"possessed of beauty, graceth the forest like a goddess,—as if a goddess"
2721,SECTION XXXIV.,"of wealth herself. Of the lustre of burnished gold, with her finger"
2722,SECTION XXXIV.,"nails reddish and projecting, and graceful, that surpassingly lovely"
2723,SECTION XXXIV.,wench is named Sitā—the slender waisted daughter of Videha. And neither
2724,SECTION XXXIV.,"a goddess, nor a Gandharbi, nor a Yakshi, nor a Kinnari, had I seen"
2725,SECTION XXXIV.,"before on earth, possessed of such beauty. He that shall have Sitā for"
2726,SECTION XXXIV.,"his spouse, and who shall be warmly embraced by her, shall live longer"

2728,SECTION XXXIV.,"girl, unparalleled on earth in loveliness, who can well pride herself on"
2729,SECTION XXXIV.,"her person, is a worthy wife for thee; and thou too art a fit husband"
2730,SECTION XXXIV.,"for her. It is to bring over for thee that one of spacious hips, and a"
2731,SECTION XXXIV.,"high and well-developed bust, that I had put forth my endeavours. But, O"
2732,SECTION XXXIV.,mighty-armed one I have been disfigured by the wicked Lakshmana. As soon
2733,SECTION XXXIV.,"as thou hast seen Vaidehi having a countenance resembling the full moon,"
2734,SECTION XXXIV.,thou shalt be afflicted with the shafts of Cupid. If it is thy purpose
2735,SECTION XXXIV.,"to have her for thy wife, at once stretch forth thy right leg, for"
2736,SECTION XXXIV.,"attaining success. If, O lord of Rākshasas, thou relishest my speech, do"

2738,SECTION XXXIV.,"their incapacity, do thou, O lord of Rākshasas, for making her thy wife,"
2739,SECTION XXXIV.,by force carry away the frail Sitā of a blameless person. Hearing that

2758,SECTION XXXV.,and garnished with spectral faces as well as arrow decked with
2759,SECTION XXXV.,"gold,—resembling a mass of clouds, the graceful ruler of the"
2760,SECTION XXXV.,Rākshasas—younger brother to the Lord of wealth—proceeded in that

2767,SECTION XXXV.,"mounted on that chariot coursing at will, appeared beautiful like a mass"
2768,SECTION XXXV.,"of clouds in the sky, with cranes, in the midst of lightning. And that"
2769,SECTION XXXV.,"one possessed of prowess beheld the shore of the sea, containing crags,"
2770,SECTION XXXV.,scattered with trees bearing fruits and flowers of various kinds by
2771,SECTION XXXV.,"thousands, bordered all around with pools furnished with cool and"
2772,SECTION XXXV.,"delightful waters, ornamented with spacious asylums having daises,"
2773,SECTION XXXV.,"graced with woods of plantain, beauteous with cocoanuts, and blossoming"
2774,SECTION XXXV.,"_sāla_ and palmyra, and _tamāla_, trees, grateful with supreme saints"
2775,SECTION XXXV.,"rigidly restraining their fear, and with serpents and fowls of fair"
2776,SECTION XXXV.,feathers and Gandharbas and Kinnaras by thousands; and pleasant with
2777,SECTION XXXV.,"Siddhas and Chāranas, that have controlled their lust; with those"
2778,SECTION XXXV.,"descendants of Brahmā—the Vaikhanas, the Māshas, the Vālakhilyas, and"
2779,SECTION XXXV.,"the Marichipas; swarming with females, divinely beautiful, dight with"
2780,SECTION XXXV.,"gorgeous ornaments and garlands, and Apsarās skilled in sport, by"
2781,SECTION XXXV.,"thousands; frequented by the wives of the celestials, and honored by"

2785,SECTION XXXV.,"cool by the influence of the ocean. And as he proceeded, the younger"
2786,SECTION XXXV.,"brother of the Lord of wealth, saw on all sides spacious cars capable of"

2788,SECTION XXXV.,"with trumpet notes,—and Gandharbas and Apsarās. And surveying by"
2789,SECTION XXXV.,"thousands woods of sandal exuding gum at their roots,⁵¹ and of choice"
2790,SECTION XXXV.,"_aguru_, grateful unto the sense of smell; and woods and groves of"
2791,SECTION XXXV.,"excellent and odorous takkola fruits; blossoms of the Tamāla, and"

2793,SECTION XXXV.,the best corals in masses;⁵² summits of gold and silver;⁵³ charming
2794,SECTION XXXV.,"pellucid rills at places; and cities filled with corn and wealth,"
2795,SECTION XXXV.,"abounding in gems of women, and thronged with horses, elephants and"
2796,SECTION XXXV.,cars—Rāvana on the shore of the ocean beheld around a level and soft
2797,SECTION XXXV.,"scene, resembling heaven itself—where breezes of delicate feel kept"
2798,SECTION XXXV.,"breathing. And there he saw a fig tree, hued like clouds, surrounded by"
2799,SECTION XXXV.,"ascetics; its branches stretched around an hundred Yoyanas, and the"
2800,SECTION XXXV.,"exceedingly powerful Garuda had ascended one of its boughs, taking an"
2801,SECTION XXXV.,"elephant and a huge tortoise, for the purpose of devouring them. And"
2802,SECTION XXXV.,"that best of birds, the powerful Suparna by his weight suddenly broke a"
2803,SECTION XXXV.,branch containing full many leaves. And it came to pass that
2804,SECTION XXXV.,"Vaikhānasas, Māshas, Vālakhilyas, Marichipas, Ayas, and Dhumras,—saints"
2805,SECTION XXXV.,"of the highest order—had assembled there. Thereat, moved by"
2806,SECTION XXXV.,"commisseration (for the ascetics), the virtuous Garuda, taking with"
2807,SECTION XXXV.,promptitude the broken bough measuring an hundred Yoyanas as well as the
2808,SECTION XXXV.,"elephant and the tortoise, by one leg, at length eating up the animals,"
2809,SECTION XXXV.,"and by means of the bough, exterminating the country of the"
2810,SECTION XXXV.,Nishadas—that best of birds attained unequalled delight in consequence
2811,SECTION XXXV.,"of having rescued the mighty ascetics. Thereat, attaining double energy"
2812,SECTION XXXV.,by virtue of that delight that intelligent one set his heart on bringing
2813,SECTION XXXV.,"ambrosia. And tearing off the iron links of the network, and bursting"
2814,SECTION XXXV.,"into the repository of gem, he carried away secreted ambrosia from the"
2815,SECTION XXXV.,residence of the great Indra. Kuvera’s younger brother beheld this fig
2816,SECTION XXXV.,"tree, named Subhadra, graced with the Maharshi, on which Suparna had"
2817,SECTION XXXV.,"left his mark. Then repairing to the other shore of that lord of rivers,"
2818,SECTION XXXV.,"the ocean, Rāvana saw an asylum lying in the forest in a charming and"
2819,SECTION XXXV.,"sacred recess. And there he saw a Rākshasa, named Māricha, clad in a"
2820,SECTION XXXV.,"dark deer-skin, bearing a head of matted locks, subsisting on restricted"
2821,SECTION XXXV.,"fare. And approaching Rāvana duly, the Rākshasa, Māricha, received the"

2849,SECTION XXXVI.,"fourteen thousands of Rākshasas of dreadful deeds, heroic,"
2850,SECTION XXXVI.,"high-spirited,— Rākshasas possessed of exceeding prowess; while residing"
2851,SECTION XXXVI.,"n Janasthāna of late,—clad in mail and equipped with various weapons,"
2852,SECTION XXXVI.,"headed by Khara, met with Rāma in the field. Getting enraged, Rāma in"
2853,SECTION XXXVI.,"conflict without returning any harsh speech, by means of his shafts shot"
2854,SECTION XXXVI.,"from his bow, —hath, a human being, and fighting on foot, with his"

2856,SECTION XXXVI.,"And Khara hath been slain in battle, and Dushana also hath been brought"
2857,SECTION XXXVI.,"down. And having slain Triçira too, (Rāma) hath rid the Dandaka of all"

2859,SECTION XXXVI.,"Kshatriyas, the weak Rāma, living in company with his wife hath effected"
2860,SECTION XXXVI.,"the destruction of this army. He is of a vile character, crabbed,"
2861,SECTION XXXVI.,"foolish, covetuous, of uncontrolled senses, bereft of morality, sinful,"
2862,SECTION XXXVI.,"and ever engaged in the evil of all creatures,—by whom, violently"
2863,SECTION XXXVI.,without hostility my sister hath been deformed in the forest by having
2864,SECTION XXXVI.,her nose and ears cut off. Of him will I carry off by force from
2865,SECTION XXXVI.,"Janasthāna, his wife, Sitā, resembling the daughter of a celestial. Be"
2866,SECTION XXXVI.,"thou my help in it. For certain, O exceedingly strong one, if thou help"
2867,SECTION XXXVI.,"me at my side, if my brothers also back me, I do not think much of all"
2868,SECTION XXXVI.,"the celestials. Therefore, be thou my help; for, thou art capable, O"
2869,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasa. In prowess in battle, and in indomitableness, there is none"
2870,SECTION XXXVI.,"like thee. Thou art a mighty hero commanding resources, and conversant"
2871,SECTION XXXVI.,"with potent illusory displays. Taking this to my heart, I have come to"
2872,SECTION XXXVI.,"thee, O ranger of the night. Do thou listen as to the business in which"
2873,SECTION XXXVI.,"by my command thou art to help me. Becoming a golden deer, marked with"
2874,SECTION XXXVI.,"silver spots, do thou range about in Rāma’s asylum in presence of Sitā."
2875,SECTION XXXVI.,"Seeing thee helpless, in the shape of a deer, Sitā will say unto her"
2876,SECTION XXXVI.,"lord and Lakshmana also,—""Do ye catch it."" And when they shall have"
2877,SECTION XXXVI.,"departed, I shall carry off from the empty asylum, Sitā without let,"
2878,SECTION XXXVI.,like Rāhu depriving the Moon of his splendour. Then when Rāma shall be
2879,SECTION XXXVI.,"sore afflicted because of the carrying off of his wife, I shall easily,"
2880,SECTION XXXVI.,"crowning my soul with success, safely bear away Sitā. Hearing Rāma’s"
2881,SECTION XXXVI.,"words, the face of the high-souled Māricha became blank and he was"
2882,SECTION XXXVI.,"seized with apprehension. And licking up his dried lips, with winkless"
2883,SECTION XXXVI.,"eyes, (Māricha) as if dead, and exceedingly distressed, eyed Rāvana,"
2884,SECTION XXXVI.,"steadily. And alarmed because of Rāvana, with his mind depressed,"
2885,SECTION XXXVI.,"Māricha who well knew Rāma’s prowess in the forest, with joined hands in"

2905,SECTION XXXVII.,"sovereign who is wicked, whimsical and of evil intent like thee,"
2906,SECTION XXXVII.,bringeth about his own destruction as well as that of his kingdom and
2907,SECTION XXXVII.,"relatives. Rāma, the enhancer of Kauçalya’s delight hath not been"
2908,SECTION XXXVII.,"abandoned by his father, nor is he devoid of propriety of conduct; he is"
2909,SECTION XXXVII.,"not avaricious, wicked nor the destroyer of Kastriya race. He does not"
2910,SECTION XXXVII.,"lack religious merits or accomplishments, nor is he of a harsh"
2911,SECTION XXXVII.,temperament and intent on causing misery unto creatures. Finding his
2912,SECTION XXXVII.,truthful sire imposed on by Kaikeyi he has sojourned unto woods. For
2913,SECTION XXXVII.,compassing the welfare of his father Daçaratha and Kaikeyi he hath
2914,SECTION XXXVII.,"entered the forest of Dandaka. Rāma, O my child is not harsh or foolish;"
2915,SECTION XXXVII.,nor has he not control over his senses. Far from speaking untruth he
2916,SECTION XXXVII.,does not know false stories even. It doth not behove thee therefore to
2917,SECTION XXXVII.,"use such improper language towards him. He is an incarnation of virtue,"
2918,SECTION XXXVII.,"pious and truthful, and lord of all men as Bāsava of all celestials. How"
2919,SECTION XXXVII.,"dost thou then wish to carry away by force his Vaidehi, protected by"
2920,SECTION XXXVII.,"virtue of her own chastity, like unto the rays of Sun? It doth not"
2921,SECTION XXXVII.,behove thee to enter that fire of Rāma who hath arrows for rays and bow
2922,SECTION XXXVII.,"and scimitar for fuel. It doth not behove thee, O Rāvana, to approach"
2923,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāma renouncing thy kingdom, happiness and love of life, who is like"
2924,SECTION XXXVII.,"unto death itself and has bow for his widened and flaming mouth, and"
2925,SECTION XXXVII.,"arrows for his rays and who is irrepressible, of mighty prowess, holding"
2926,SECTION XXXVII.,bows and arrows and repulsing the forces of the enemy. Incomparable is
2927,SECTION XXXVII.,his power; daughter of Janaka is his wife and lives in the forest
2928,SECTION XXXVII.,confiding in the mighty strength of his bow; thou shalt not be able to
2929,SECTION XXXVII.,carry her away. She is the beloved wife of that best of men having a
2930,SECTION XXXVII.,leonine chest—and he holds his wife dearer than his life and is ever
2931,SECTION XXXVII.,"attached unto her. And young Sitā beloved of the mighty Rāma, and like"
2932,SECTION XXXVII.,unto the rays of flaming fire is ever incapable of being carried away by
2933,SECTION XXXVII.,thee. Of what avail is this vain attempt O Rākshasa chief? No sooner
2934,SECTION XXXVII.,Rāma shall see you in the battle thou shalt meet with thy end. Hard it
2935,SECTION XXXVII.,"is to attain life, happiness and kingdom, so it behoveth thee to act"
2936,SECTION XXXVII.,"properly, after consulting with thy ministers headed by Bivishana,"
2937,SECTION XXXVII.,judging Rāma’s merits and demerits and ascertaining his and thy own
2938,SECTION XXXVII.,strength and as well as thy welfare. Methinks thy approaching conflict
2939,SECTION XXXVII.,with the son of the Koçala chief forebodes no good unto thee; hear again

2947,SECTION XXXVIII.,
2948,SECTION XXXVIII.,Once on a time I was engaged in travelling all over the earth. I had in
2949,SECTION XXXVIII.,"my body, resembling a huge mountain, the strength of a thousand Nāgas. I"
2950,SECTION XXXVIII.,"had _parigha_ in my hands, crown on my head and golden ear-rings on my"
2951,SECTION XXXVIII.,ears and my body was of a dark blue colour like that of a cloud. Causing
2952,SECTION XXXVIII.,fright unto the people I used to wander through the forest of Dandaka
2953,SECTION XXXVIII.,and live upon the flesh of the Rishis. The pious ascetic Viswamitra
2954,SECTION XXXVIII.,"being afraid of me went in person to the king Daçaratha and said, ""When"
2955,SECTION XXXVIII.,"I shall remain absorbed in meditation on the occasion of parva, let Rāma"
2956,SECTION XXXVIII.,"protect me O king, Truly am I afraid of this Māricha."" Being thus"
2957,SECTION XXXVIII.,"addressed by the ascetic the virtuous-souled king Daçaratha replied,"
2958,SECTION XXXVIII.,"saying ""Rāghava is still under twelve years of age and hath not been"
2959,SECTION XXXVIII.,"well disciplined in military arts. But I have soldiers enough, and if"
2960,SECTION XXXVIII.,"permitted by thee, O thou best of ascetics, I shall with my four-fold"
2961,SECTION XXXVIII.,"forces kill thy enemies, the rangers of the night."" Being thus addressed"
2962,SECTION XXXVIII.,"that ascetic spoke unto the monarch, saying, ""True it is that thou wert"
2963,SECTION XXXVIII.,the protector of the celestials in the War and thy exploits are well
2964,SECTION XXXVIII.,"known to the world, but no one shall be able to withstand the Rākshasas"
2965,SECTION XXXVIII.,"but Rāma. The highly energetic Rāma, though a boy is sufficiently"
2966,SECTION XXXVIII.,"qualified to defeat the enemies; therefore, O Destroyer of foes, let thy"
2967,SECTION XXXVIII.,soldiery remain here and let me proceed along with Rāma. May God bless
2968,SECTION XXXVIII.,"thee."" Saying this the ascetic Viswamitra being pleased went to his"
2969,SECTION XXXVIII.,asylum along with Rāma. Afterwards having been initiated for the
2970,SECTION XXXVIII.,sacrifice in the forest of Dandaka Rāma having unstrung his mighty bow
2971,SECTION XXXVIII.,came to the ascetic to protect the sacrifice. He had a gold chain round
2972,SECTION XXXVIII.,"his neck, a crest on his head and a bow in his hands; he had a pair of"
2973,SECTION XXXVIII.,"beautiful eyes, and only one piece of cloth; his countenance was of"
2974,SECTION XXXVIII.,green hue and exquisite beauty and even then mustaches or other signs of
2975,SECTION XXXVIII.,manhood did not appear on his face. Beautifying the entire forest of
2976,SECTION XXXVIII.,Dandaka with his own splendour Rāma appeared like the newly risen moon.
2977,SECTION XXXVIII.,Thereupon I resembling a cloud and having golden ear locks entered the
2978,SECTION XXXVIII.,asylum being proud of my power on account of the boons offered unto me
2979,SECTION XXXVIII.,by Brahmā. Seeing me enter he took up his dart and attached string unto
2980,SECTION XXXVIII.,his bow with proper care. Being under the influence of sheer foolishness
2981,SECTION XXXVIII.,I passed by him as a child and darted towards the sacrificial altar of
2982,SECTION XXXVIII.,Viswamitra. Thereupon he wounded me with a sharpened sword capable of
2983,SECTION XXXVIII.,doing away with the enemies and threw me away into the ocean situated at
2984,SECTION XXXVIII.,a distance of hundred yojanas. He had no mind of killing me then and for
2985,SECTION XXXVIII.,this he saved my life. I was thrown however into the deep ocean being
2986,SECTION XXXVIII.,hindered by the velocity of his arrows and having lost my consciousness.
2987,SECTION XXXVIII.,Regaining my sense after a long while I returned the city of Lankā.
2988,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Myself saved thus, my followers however were all killed by Rāma of"
2989,SECTION XXXVIII.,unwearied activity though a mere child and a novice in the art of
2990,SECTION XXXVIII.,warfare. It is for this that I do prevent thee; thou shalt be
2991,SECTION XXXVIII.,overwhelmed with calamities and meet with destruction if dost thou
2992,SECTION XXXVIII.,engage thyself in battle with him. In vain shalt thou bring about the
2993,SECTION XXXVIII.,affliction of the mirthful and sportive Rākshasas ever witnessing social
2994,SECTION XXXVIII.,festivities. And in vain shalt thou for Sitā compass the destruction of
2995,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the city of Lankā, adorned with diverse jewels and filled with golden"
2996,SECTION XXXVIII.,"edifices. Pious men living with a vicious man, meet with destruction for"
2997,SECTION XXXVIII.,"his sins, though they themselves do not commit any misdeed, like unto"
2998,SECTION XXXVIII.,fish (devoured by Garuda) living in a lake where snakes dwell. Thus
2999,SECTION XXXVIII.,"shalt thou witness that for thy own folly the rangers of the night,"
3000,SECTION XXXVIII.,adorned with celestial ornaments and having their body pasted with
3001,SECTION XXXVIII.,"sandal, have been killed and brought down to the earth. And they"
3002,SECTION XXXVIII.,"deprived of shelter have fled away to different directions, some with"
3003,SECTION XXXVIII.,"their wives and some alone, having their wives carried away (by the"
3004,SECTION XXXVIII.,"enemies). Thou shalt further observe that all edifices of Lankā, being"
3005,SECTION XXXVIII.,enveloped with arrows and flaming fire have been burnt down to ashes.
3006,SECTION XXXVIII.,There is no greater sin on earth than carrying away another’s wife.
3007,SECTION XXXVIII.,There are a thousand ladies in thy seraglio O king. Being attached unto
3008,SECTION XXXVIII.,"thy wives do thou preserve the race of the Rākshasas, thy own line, thy"
3009,SECTION XXXVIII.,"wished for life, kingdom, wealth and dignity. Do not bring about Rāma’s"
3010,SECTION XXXVIII.,mischief if dost thou wish to live happily with thy wives and friends. I
3011,SECTION XXXVIII.,am thy friend and do ask thee again and again to desist (from thy evil
3012,SECTION XXXVIII.,intentions); if dost thou encroach upon Sitā surely shalt thou along
3013,SECTION XXXVIII.,with thy kinsmen go to the abode of Yama being enfeebled by the arrows
3014,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of Rāma."""

3021,SECTION XXXIX.,I was however somehow saved by Rāma in that conflict. Listen what
3022,SECTION XXXIX.,happened afterwards. I was not humbled even by the danger of my life.
3023,SECTION XXXIX.,Once again I entered the forest of Dandaka accompanied by two Rākshasas
3024,SECTION XXXIX.,"assuming the shape of deer. I had a flaming tongue, huge teeth,"
3025,SECTION XXXIX.,sharpened horns and lived on the flesh of ascetics. Assuming such a
3026,SECTION XXXIX.,terrible appearance I began to traverse with great vehemence the
3027,SECTION XXXIX.,"_Tirtha_, _Agnihotri_ and the place of worship; eating the flesh and"
3028,SECTION XXXIX.,drinking the blood of the ascetics after killing them I began to hinder
3029,SECTION XXXIX.,all religious services. I had a most ugly figure and was maddened with
3030,SECTION XXXIX.,"drinking blood, and all the animals of the forest were exceedingly"
3031,SECTION XXXIX.,frightened at me. White I was thus traversing the forest of Dandaka
3032,SECTION XXXIX.,throwing obstacles in the way of religious services I saw the pious
3033,SECTION XXXIX.,"ascetic Rāma living on a restricted fare, the honored Sitā and the"
3034,SECTION XXXIX.,"mighty Lakshmana, taking recourse to asceticism, moderate in eating and"
3035,SECTION XXXIX.,ever engaged in the welfare of created beings. Remembering his former
3036,SECTION XXXIX.,"enmity and aggrandisement, I, being extremely wrathful, in my deer shape"
3037,SECTION XXXIX.,"and with my sharpened horns, darted towards him with a view to kill him,"
3038,SECTION XXXIX.,considering through my ignorance the effulgent Rāma as none other but an
3039,SECTION XXXIX.,ascetic living in the forest. Then stringing his huge bow he darted
3040,SECTION XXXIX.,three sharpened arrows at me. Those three terrible arrows with bent
3041,SECTION XXXIX.,"knots resembling thunder-bolts, killing enemies and drinking blood and"
3042,SECTION XXXIX.,"having the motion of Garuda and air, coalescing with each other came"
3043,SECTION XXXIX.,"before us. Wicked as I am, I was fully aware of his prowess having been"
3044,SECTION XXXIX.,"frightend by him on a former occasion, and so I saved myself by"
3045,SECTION XXXIX.,"escaping, but those two Rākshasas were killed. O Rāvana, any how saved"
3046,SECTION XXXIX.,from the arrows of Rāma and having got my life back I have resorted to
3047,SECTION XXXIX.,the life of an ascetic and have been carrying on asceticism here being
3048,SECTION XXXIX.,absorbed in _Yoga_.
3049,SECTION XXXIX.,
3050,SECTION XXXIX.,From that very day I see Rāma wearing bark and deer skin even in the
3051,SECTION XXXIX.,very trees before me like unto Death with the noose in his hands.
3052,SECTION XXXIX.,Terrified as I am I always seeing thousands of Rāma around me. Me seems
3053,SECTION XXXIX.,"the entire forest is inhabited by Rāma only. O king of Rākshasas, I see"
3054,SECTION XXXIX.,Rāma even in the quarter where there is no Rāma. Seeing him in my dreams
3055,SECTION XXXIX.,even I look around like one awaken. O Rāvana what more shall I speak
3056,SECTION XXXIX.,"unto thee, I am so much afraid of Rāma that such words as Ratna (jewel)"
3057,SECTION XXXIX.,Ratha (chariot) which begin with the letter Ra administer consternation
3058,SECTION XXXIX.,unto me. I am fully apprised of the prowess of that descendant of Raghu;
3059,SECTION XXXIX.,it doth not behove thee to enter into conflict with him; he can destroy
3060,SECTION XXXIX.,"Vāli and Namuchi. Rāvana, whether dost thou fight with Rāma or not, do"
3061,SECTION XXXIX.,not mention him unto me if dost thou wish to see me. Many persons pious
3062,SECTION XXXIX.,and devoted to asceticism on this earth have met with destruction for
3063,SECTION XXXIX.,another’s misdeeds. And I shall meet with a similar fate for thy sins. O
3064,SECTION XXXIX.,"thou the ranger of night do whatever thou likest, I shall not follow"
3065,SECTION XXXIX.,thee. Truely is that highly intelligent and effulgent Rāma of mighty
3066,SECTION XXXIX.,"prowess, like death itself unto the rangers of night. Though the wicked"
3067,SECTION XXXIX.,"Khara of Janasthāna hath been slain by him on Surpanakhā’s account, yet"
3068,SECTION XXXIX.,how is he to blame for it? Do thou truly speak. Thou art my friend; it
3069,SECTION XXXIX.,is for this and for thy welfare that I speak this truth unto thee. If
3070,SECTION XXXIX.,"dost thou not follow my words, thyself with all thy kinsmen, shall be"
3071,SECTION XXXIX.,slain in battle by Rāma.

3081,SECTION XL.,"Moreover he addressed him with the following harsh words. ""O, Māricha,"
3082,SECTION XL.,"what thou hast spoken unto me, shall bear no fruit like unto seeds sown"
3083,SECTION XL.,into a desert-land. I shall not be frightened thereby to fight with that
3084,SECTION XL.,foolish Rāma—a human being of vicious deeds. Surely shall I before thee

3086,SECTION XL.,"whose words he has sojourned into woods renouncing his father mother,"

3088,SECTION XL.,"Māricha; even Indra, with the celestials and Ashuras shall not be able"
3089,SECTION XL.,to shake it. It would have been proper for thee to give vent to these

3091,SECTION XL.,"propriety or impropriety of my action, its way or losses. A wise"
3092,SECTION XL.,counsellor who wishes prosperity unto himself should always communicate
3093,SECTION XL.,unto his master his desire with joined hands whenever asked to do so. It
3094,SECTION XL.,is always proper to speak before monarchs such pleasant and favourable
3095,SECTION XL.,words as are intended for the welfare of the master and are sanctioned
3096,SECTION XL.,by the royal etiquette. A respectable king doth not receive with good
3097,SECTION XL.,grace friendly words even when they are expressed disrespectfully.
3098,SECTION XL.,"Sovereigns of superb prowess assume the semblance of five deities—Agni,"

3102,SECTION XL.,on all occasions. Thou art ignorant of kingly morality and fully
3103,SECTION XL.,absorbed in illusion. It is for this that thou dost out of thy

3105,SECTION XL.,"not ask thee O, Rākshasa about the propriety (of my conduct or about my"

3107,SECTION XL.,to do at my request in my aid; assuming the shape of a deer having
3108,SECTION XL.,golden skin painted with silvery drops do thou proceed to the asylum of
3109,SECTION XL.,"Rāma, and ranging at large before Vaidehi do thou after captivating her"
3110,SECTION XL.,"take thy wished-for way. Vaidehi, being struck with wonder seeing thee a"
3111,SECTION XL.,"golden deer capable of illusions, shall request Rāma to get thee soon"
3112,SECTION XL.,"for her. Kākuthstha issuing out of the asylum, thou shalt, at great"

3140,SECTION XLI.,himself happy at thy welfare? Who hath pointed out unto thee the way of
3141,SECTION XLI.,thy death under the cover of thy means? O Ranger of night surely do thy
3142,SECTION XLI.,weak enemies wish to bring about thy destruction by making thee enter
3143,SECTION XLI.,into a conflict with a powerful man. What little-minded man of evil

3146,SECTION XLI.,"Thou dost not exterminate thy counsellors O Rāvana, albeit they are"

3150,SECTION XLI.,"they are quite unmindful, though thou shouldst by every means be brought"

3152,SECTION XLI.,"night, ministers by the grace of their sovereign attain virtue, wealth,"
3153,SECTION XLI.,desires and fame. But those objects are never attained O Rāvana when
3154,SECTION XLI.,they are not in good odour with their sovereign; moreover the subjects
3155,SECTION XLI.,meet with dangers when he is devoid of all qualities. O thou the best of
3156,SECTION XLI.,"conquerors, the king is the root of virtue and fame unto the subjects;"
3157,SECTION XLI.,"he should therefore be always protected by them. O ranger of night,"
3158,SECTION XLI.,"proud kings of cruel temperament, acting against the subjects can never"

3160,SECTION XLI.,with their end like unto a chariot driven into a wild track by an
3161,SECTION XLI.,"unskilled charioteer. Many a pious person, on this earth, ever engaged"
3162,SECTION XLI.,"in the performance of religious services, have, for the folly of other"
3163,SECTION XLI.,"persons, met with destruction along with their relatives. Verily the"
3164,SECTION XLI.,"subjects, O Rāvana, can never expect to prosper under the regime of"
3165,SECTION XLI.,hot-natured sovereigns acting against their subjects like unto deer
3166,SECTION XLI.,"under the protection of a jackal. All the Rākshasas shall surely die, O"
3167,SECTION XLI.,"Rāvana whose lord art thou, foolish, cruel and under the control of thy"
3168,SECTION XLI.,passions. I shall not be the least sorry if I do meet with a sudden
3169,SECTION XLI.,accident—what I do deplore most is that thou shalt meet in no time with
3170,SECTION XLI.,destruction along with thy soldiery. Compassing my end Rāma shall
3171,SECTION XLI.,enterminate thee in no time—and blessed I shall be being killed by an
3172,SECTION XLI.,enemy in the conflict. Surely dost thou know that no sooner shall I see
3173,SECTION XLI.,Rāma I shall be done away with; thou shalt carrying away Sitā meet with
3174,SECTION XLI.,thy end along with thy kinsmen. And if dost thou bring Sitā with me from
3175,SECTION XLI.,"the asylum, none shall be saved,—me, thyself, the city of Lankā, and the"
3176,SECTION XLI.,Rākshasas. Thou dost not relish my words O ranger of the night though
3177,SECTION XLI.,"prevented by me, who wishes thee welfare; those men who range on the"
3178,SECTION XLI.,"verge of death, well-nigh finishing the term of their existence do not"

3202,SECTION XLII.,unto a heavenly car set out for the hermitage. And beholding diverse
3203,SECTION XLII.,"towns, forests, mountains, rivers, kingdoms and cities they reached the"
3204,SECTION XLII.,forest of Dandaka and the asylum of Rāma. And descending now from the
3205,SECTION XLII.,golden car the lord of Rākshasas together with Māricha beheld Rāma’s

3208,SECTION XLII.,"which we have come here."" Hearing the words of Rāvana, the Rākshasa"
3209,SECTION XLII.,Māricha assuming the wonderful shape of a (golden) deer began to range
3210,SECTION XLII.,at large before Rāma’s hermitage. The points of its horns were like unto
3211,SECTION XLII.,"(two) excellent jewels, its countenance was diversified with white and"
3212,SECTION XLII.,"black colour, its face was like a red lotus, its ears were like unto two"
3213,SECTION XLII.,"blue lotuses, its neck was little raised, its belly was like a saphire,"
3214,SECTION XLII.,"its sides were like unto Madhuka flowers, its color was like that of a"
3215,SECTION XLII.,"filament of a lotus, its hoops were like unto _Baidurjas_ (a gem of a"
3216,SECTION XLII.,dark color); of lean thighs; of firm joints; its tail having the
3217,SECTION XLII.,diversified color of a rainbow was upraised. It was of a pleasant and
3218,SECTION XLII.,cool hue and crested with various jewels.
3219,SECTION XLII.,
3220,SECTION XLII.,And in no time the Rākshasa assumed the shape of a beautiful deer. To
3221,SECTION XLII.,"tempt Vaidehi that ranger of the night, assuming a beautiful countenance"
3222,SECTION XLII.,"painted with diverse metals, illumining the beautiful forest and Rāma’s"
3223,SECTION XLII.,"asylum with its beauty, and ranging at large on the green field and"
3224,SECTION XLII.,"living on grass, began to proceed. That one of lively presence having"
3225,SECTION XLII.,its body painted with hundreds of silver drops and living on twigs of
3226,SECTION XLII.,trees began to range in the forest. Sometimes walking into the plantain
3227,SECTION XLII.,"house, sometimes walking around the forest of _Karnikā_, sometimes"
3228,SECTION XLII.,"coming within the compass of Sitā’s vision, that best of deer having its"
3229,SECTION XLII.,back painted with gold began to range slowly around the hermitage. It
3230,SECTION XLII.,"began to walk at pleasure near Rāma’s asylum. Sometimes going, sometimes"
3231,SECTION XLII.,"stopping, at one time running very swiftly and receding the next moment,"
3232,SECTION XLII.,"that best of deer began to range at large. Sometimes playing around,"
3233,SECTION XLII.,sometimes lying on earth and sometimes following the deer-herd having
3234,SECTION XLII.,come within the threshhold of the asylum and then followed again by them
3235,SECTION XLII.,that Rākshasa assuming the form of a deer came back to see Sitā. He then
3236,SECTION XLII.,began to range at large in the beautiful forest (extending far and
3237,SECTION XLII.,wide). Seeing him other forest-deer came (by him) and smelling him fled
3238,SECTION XLII.,"away into different quarters. That Rākshasa, though expert in killing"
3239,SECTION XLII.,"deer, did not eat them up, though touching, inorder to hide his real"
3240,SECTION XLII.,"self. In the meantime Vaidehi, of auspicious looks whose eyes inebriate"
3241,SECTION XLII.,"like wine, being engaged in plucking flowers, was going sometimes to the"
3242,SECTION XLII.,"_Karnika_ grove and sometimes to the mangoe grove. That best of women,"
3243,SECTION XLII.,ever inured to living in the forest and possessed of a graceful
3244,SECTION XLII.,"countenance, walking and plucking flowers, saw that jewelled deer,"
3245,SECTION XLII.,having its body deversified with pearls and diamonds. It had beautiful
3246,SECTION XLII.,teeth and lips and had its down resembling silver. She began to behold
3247,SECTION XLII.,with affection and with her eyes expanded with surprise. That illusive
3248,SECTION XLII.,deer seeing Rāma’s wife began to move around as if lighting up that
3249,SECTION XLII.,forest (with the fire of its beauty). Beholding that deer ornamented

3260,SECTION XLIII.,having the color of her body like that of pure gold became immensely

3262,SECTION XLIII.,"their hands. ""Do thou come soon, do thou come soon, O son of the"
3263,SECTION XLIII.,"worshipful Sire, along with thy younger brother"" —having called (her"
3264,SECTION XLIII.,husband) again and again in this strain she continued beholding that
3265,SECTION XLIII.,deer. Being thus called by the daughter of the king of Videha those two
3266,SECTION XLIII.,"best of men Rāma and Lakshmana, casting their looks around beheld that"
3267,SECTION XLIII.,"deer. Seeing him Lakshmana, struck with fear, said ""Methinks, this deer"
3268,SECTION XLIII.,"is the Rākshasa Māricha. This vicious Māricha, O Rāma, assuming the"
3269,SECTION XLIII.,shape of a deer oftentimes kills at pleasure the kings who come here
3270,SECTION XLIII.,"a-hunting. He is cognizant of illusions, by virtue of which he has"
3271,SECTION XLIII.,"assumed this shape, O best of men; its countenance is perfectly fine"
3272,SECTION XLIII.,like the abode of Gandharbas and resplendent like the Sun; there is no
3273,SECTION XLIII.,"such jewelled deer on earth. O Rāghava, O Lord of earth, there is no"
3274,SECTION XLIII.,"doubt that this is nothing but illusion."" When Lakshmana spake thus Sitā"
3275,SECTION XLIII.,with a pure smile being under the influence of enchantment contradicted
3276,SECTION XLIII.,"him, and being pleased said ""O son of the worshipful Sire, this deer"
3277,SECTION XLIII.,"hath attracted my mind, get it for me, pray, O thou of mighty arms; it"
3278,SECTION XLIII.,shall be an object of sport for us. Many a beautiful deer range at large
3279,SECTION XLIII.,"in the vicinity of our hermitage such as _Chamara_, _Srimara_, _Rik_,"
3280,SECTION XLIII.,"_Prishata_, _Bānara_, and _Kinnara_. They are all very beautiful and of"
3281,SECTION XLIII.,"mighty strength; but O Prince, I have never seen before the like of this"
3282,SECTION XLIII.,"deer. In energy, strength and beauty it stands above all deer. Its"
3283,SECTION XLIII.,"entire body is diversified with various colors, nay, it is a jewel"
3284,SECTION XLIII.,"itself. It moves before me, beautifying the forest with its"
3285,SECTION XLIII.,"resplendance, like unto Moon himself. Ah! what beauty, what beautiful a"
3286,SECTION XLIII.,"lustre, how musical a voice, this wonderful deer of variegated"
3287,SECTION XLIII.,"countenance, hath indeed captivated my heart! If canst thou get by this"
3288,SECTION XLIII.,"deer alive, O what wonder, what surprise! When shall we regain our"
3289,SECTION XLIII.,"kingdom after the expiry of the term of our banishment, this deer shall"
3290,SECTION XLIII.,"beautify the interior of our palace. O Lord, truly shall this celestial"
3291,SECTION XLIII.,"deer create surprise in Bharata, yourself, me and my mothers-in-law. O"
3292,SECTION XLIII.,"best of men, if canst thou not get hold of it alive its skin shall also"
3293,SECTION XLIII.,look very beautiful (to us). Spreading on Kuça the skin of this golden
3294,SECTION XLIII.,deer when killed do I wish to invoke the Almighty. It looks (no doubt)
3295,SECTION XLIII.,unseemly and terrible and smacks of wilfulness on the part of a wife to
3296,SECTION XLIII.,"command her husband in this way, but I am sunk in surprise seeing the"
3297,SECTION XLIII.,"countenance of the deer."" Rāma’s heart was struck with surprise"
3298,SECTION XLIII.,"beholding that wonderful deer having its down resembling gold, horns"
3299,SECTION XLIII.,"resembling exquisitely fine diamonds, color like that of the newly risen"
3300,SECTION XLIII.,"Sun, and resplendance like that of the orbit of the planets. Being"
3301,SECTION XLIII.,"enchanted by its beauty and spurred on by Sitā’s words, Rāghava pleased,"
3302,SECTION XLIII.,"spake unto his younger brother saying ""Behold, O Lakshmana, it has"
3303,SECTION XLIII.,immensely excited Vaidehi’s desire. On account of its exquisite beauty
3304,SECTION XLIII.,it shall loose its life to-day. It has its equal no where on the
3305,SECTION XLIII.,earth—neither in the celestial garden nor in the Chaittraratha forest.
3306,SECTION XLIII.,The hairs of its body being arranged in regular and contrary courses and
3307,SECTION XLIII.,being painted with golden drops do indeed look very beautiful. Do thou
3308,SECTION XLIII.,"see, while expanding its mouth, its tongue comes out resembling flaming"
3309,SECTION XLIII.,fire like unto a thunder-bolt reaving the mass of clouds. Its face is
3310,SECTION XLIII.,"like a glass made of best blue saphire, its belly resembling a conch and"
3311,SECTION XLIII.,"pearl, and it is very difficult to ascertain its shapes. Beholding it"
3312,SECTION XLIII.,who is there (on earth) whose heart is not enamoured? Its beauty
3313,SECTION XLIII.,resembles the rays of gold and is variegated with diverse hues of
3314,SECTION XLIII.,jewels. Whose heart is not enveloped with surprise beholding such a
3315,SECTION XLIII.,"celestial beauty, O Lakshmana? Princes, with bows in their hands,"
3316,SECTION XLIII.,while-a hunting in a deep forest destroy deer either for flesh or for
3317,SECTION XLIII.,sport. Moreover while engaged in sporting they collect many a jewel and
3318,SECTION XLIII.,"various metals as gold and silver, in the woods. There is not the least"
3319,SECTION XLIII.,doubt that these wild riches filling up their coffers are comparatively
3320,SECTION XLIII.,far better (than the wealth acquired by other sources) like unto the
3321,SECTION XLIII.,"objects of enjoyment, enjoyed at their fancy by the people inhabiting"
3322,SECTION XLIII.,the celestial region. The object which persons desirous of acquiring
3323,SECTION XLIII.,"wealth follow without any discretion in their actions, is the true"
3324,SECTION XLIII.,definition of wealth given by the political economists. Vaidehi of
3325,SECTION XLIII.,slender waist desireth to sit with me on the exquisitely fine golden
3326,SECTION XLIII.,"skin of this gem of a deer, meseems no deer skin is so comfortable to"
3327,SECTION XLIII.,"touch as this—neither the skin of _Kādali_, _Priaki_, _Prabeni_ nor of"
3328,SECTION XLIII.,_Abiki_. Truly handsome in this deer and the one that rangeth in the
3329,SECTION XLIII.,"welkin, indeed these two deer only are celestial—the one that rangeth in"
3330,SECTION XLIII.,the sky⁵⁴ (Mrigashirā) and this that rangeth on earth. And if it be a
3331,SECTION XLIII.,"Rākshasa’s illusion as thou sayest, O Lakshmana, then it must be killed"
3332,SECTION XLIII.,by me. This cruel vicious-souled Māricha made away with many eminent
3333,SECTION XLIII.,"ascetics, while traveling in the forest; and this Rākshasa assuming the"
3334,SECTION XLIII.,shape of an illusive deer destroyed many kings —mighty archers while
3335,SECTION XLIII.,a-hunting in this forest; it is for this that this deer must be killed.
3336,SECTION XLIII.,Formerly this _Bātapi_⁵⁵ entering into the womb of twice-born ones used
3337,SECTION XLIII.,to come out reaving them like unto the embryo of a mule. Once on a time
3338,SECTION XLIII.,this Bātapi approached the eminent saint Agastya and was devoured by
3339,SECTION XLIII.,"him. After the _Sradha_ ceremony had been over, finding that Bātapi"
3340,SECTION XLIII.,desirious of assuming the shape of a Rākshasa the great saint Agastya
3341,SECTION XLIII.,"said smiling ""Being blinded with thy prowess O Bātapi, thou hast"
3342,SECTION XLIII.,destroyed many eminent twice-born ones on this earth and for this that I
3343,SECTION XLIII.,"do digest thee. Truly that Rākshasa O, Lakshmana, who wisheth to surpass"
3344,SECTION XLIII.,one like me who hath controlled his senses and is ever engaged in pious
3345,SECTION XLIII.,offices shall meet with his end like unto this Bātapi. Therefore this
3346,SECTION XLIII.,Māricha approaching me shall be killed by me like unto Bātapi being
3347,SECTION XLIII.,devoured by Agastya. Do thou therefore vigilently protect Vaidehi with
3348,SECTION XLIII.,"mail and armours on. It is our prime duty, O descendant of Raghu, to"
3349,SECTION XLIII.,protect Jānaki. I shall either kill this deer or shall get hold of it.
3350,SECTION XLIII.,"Look, O Lakshmana, Vaidehi is extremely anxious to get the skin of this"
3351,SECTION XLIII.,"deer, I shall therefore proceed at once, O son of Sumil to catch this"
3352,SECTION XLIII.,deer. The skin of this deer is the best of its kind; for certain shall
3353,SECTION XLIII.,"it loose its life today. As long as I do not kill this deer, O"
3354,SECTION XLIII.,"Lakshmana, do thou with Sitā remain with vigilance in this asylum. I"
3355,SECTION XLIII.,shall in no time come back with its skin after killing it with one
3356,SECTION XLIII.,"arrow. Do thou stay here, O Lakshmana, with Jānaki in constant fear and"
3357,SECTION XLIII.,"vigilance, along with the mighty Yatāyu, intelligent and e engaged in"
3358,SECTION XLIII.,pious offices.

3372,SECTION XLIV.,"his bow bent at three places, which served him as an ornament,—as well"
3373,SECTION XLIV.,as a couple of quivers that one of fierce energy sallied out. Seeing

3379,SECTION XLIV.,"seeming to have got beyond arrow range, and at others tempting Rāma (by"

3381,SECTION XLIV.,deer) seemed to course the welkin; and in the forest now he became
3382,SECTION XLIV.,visible and now vanished from sight. And like the autumual lunar disc
3383,SECTION XLIV.,"enveloped by indented clouds, he momentarily showed himself, and anon"
3384,SECTION XLIV.,discovered himself at a distance. And Māricha wearing the shape of a
3385,SECTION XLIV.,"deer, showing himself and disappearing from sight, drew Rāghava a long"
3386,SECTION XLIV.,"way from the hermitage. Thereat Rāma, eagerly anxious to secure the"
3387,SECTION XLIV.,"deer, being foiled by the deer, and in consequence growing enraged,"
3388,SECTION XLIV.,"wearied out, rested under a shadow, on a sward. And that ranger of the"
3389,SECTION XLIV.,"night, wearing the form of a deer, maddening Rāma, discovered himself"
3390,SECTION XLIV.,(again) at a distance surrounded by (other) deer. And Rāma desirous of
3391,SECTION XLIV.,"taking (the beast), seeing him again, set off at speed. At the very"
3392,SECTION XLIV.,moment the deer disappeared from fear; and again showed himself at a
3393,SECTION XLIV.,"distance behind a tree. And seeing him, the exceedingly energetic and"
3394,SECTION XLIV.,"strong Rāghava, determined to slay him, growing wroth, taking out a"
3395,SECTION XLIV.,"flaming shaft, resembling the rays of the sun, powerfully drew his bow,"
3396,SECTION XLIV.,"and firmly setting the shaft, and aiming it at the deer, let go the"
3397,SECTION XLIV.,"blazing and burning weapon forged by Brahmā, resembling a flaming"
3398,SECTION XLIV.,"serpent. And that best of arrows, like unto a thunderbolt, deeply"
3399,SECTION XLIV.,"pierced the breast of Māricha, wearing the shape of a deer. Thereat"
3400,SECTION XLIV.,"bounding up high as a palmyra palm, that one whose saws had almost run"
3401,SECTION XLIV.,"out, uttered terrible sounds, lying on the earth. And while on the point"
3402,SECTION XLIV.,"of death, Māricha renounced his counterfeit shape. And remembering the"
3403,SECTION XLIV.,"words of Rāvana, the Rākshasa reflected, ""By what means can Sitā send"
3404,SECTION XLIV.,"away Lakshmana, and Rāvana carry off Sitā staying in solitude?"" And"
3405,SECTION XLIV.,"pierced to the marrow by that peerless shaft, Māricha, renouncing his"
3406,SECTION XLIV.,"deer form, resumed his Rākshasa lineaments; and giving up his life"
3407,SECTION XLIV.,"attaining a huge person, considering the time had come (for availing"
3408,SECTION XLIV.,"himself of the advice tendered by Rāvana), began to cry with the voice"
3409,SECTION XLIV.,"of Rāghava, ""Ah Sitā! Ah Lakshmana!"" And seeing that grim-visaged"
3410,SECTION XLIV.,"Rākshasa lying low on the ground, with his person bathed in blood, and"
3411,SECTION XLIV.,"rolling hither and thither, Rim a proceeded towards the asylum, thinking"
3412,SECTION XLIV.,of Sitā. and revolving within himself Lakshmana’s words. While returning

3416,SECTION XLIV.,Lakshmana. I do not know what shall Sitā do hearing the cry? And what
3417,SECTION XLIV.,"shall the mighty-armed Lakshmana do?"" While pondering thus the hairs of"

3440,SECTION XLV.,"desire, for fine, O Lakshmana, Rāma’s destruction? Truely being under"
3441,SECTION XLV.,the influence of lust for me thou dost not follow Rāghava! For this thou
3442,SECTION XLV.,dost welcome Rāma’s disaster; thou hast no affection for him. For this
3443,SECTION XLV.,it is that thou dost sit here without anxiety not seeing the highly
3444,SECTION XLV.,"effulgent (Rāma). Rāma, following whom thou hast repaired unto this"
3445,SECTION XLV.,"forest, being in danger, of what avail is life unto me?"" Vaidehi"
3446,SECTION XLV.,"Speaking thus being influenced by sorrow, and with tears in her eyes,"
3447,SECTION XLV.,"like unto a deer, Lakshmana spake unto her saying ""O Vaidehi,"
3448,SECTION XLV.,"celestials, Dānavas, Gandharbas, Rākshasas, Asuras, or Pannagas, there"
3449,SECTION XLV.,is none who can defeat thy husband. There is not the least doubt in
3450,SECTION XLV.,"this. Worshipful madam! Celestials, Dānavas, Gandharbas, Rākshasas,"
3451,SECTION XLV.,"Picachas, men, Kinnaras, animals, or birds, there is none among them,"
3452,SECTION XLV.,"who can withstand Rāghava, who equals the lord of celestials in warfare."
3453,SECTION XLV.,In fact there is none who can do away with Rāma in battle. It doth not
3454,SECTION XLV.,behove thee therefore to accost me thus. Nor do I dare leave thee here
3455,SECTION XLV.,"alone in this forest without Rāma. Even the mighty heroes, as the Lord"
3456,SECTION XLV.,"of celestials, cannot subdue his prowess with all their strength. Even"
3457,SECTION XLV.,"the Almighty Himself, with the celestials and the three worlds, cannot"
3458,SECTION XLV.,defeat him. Do thou therefore renounce grief and console theyself.
3459,SECTION XLV.,Sooner shall thy husband return killing the best of deer. It is not his
3460,SECTION XLV.,voice nor one sent by any deity. It is but an illusion of that Rākshasa
3461,SECTION XLV.,"(Māricha). O Vaidehi, thou hast been left unto my charge by the"
3462,SECTION XLV.,"high-souled (Rāma)—I therefore do not dare leave thee behind, O thou the"
3463,SECTION XLV.,jewel of a damsel. We have made these night-rangers our enemies. For
3464,SECTION XLV.,"compassing the destruction of Khara, O worshipful one, and devastating"
3465,SECTION XLV.,"Janasthāna, Rākshasas oftentimes use improper words unto us in this"
3466,SECTION XLV.,"extensive forest. O Vaidehi, to create mischief unto the pious is the"
3467,SECTION XLV.,only amusement of these Rākshasas—thou shoudst not therefore be anxious
3468,SECTION XLV.,"for this."" Being thus addressed by him her eyes were reddened with ire,"
3469,SECTION XLV.,"and she spake these harsh words unto the truthful Lakshmana saying ""O"
3470,SECTION XLV.,cruel one! O thou the destroyer of thy line! it is a disgrace unto thee
3471,SECTION XLV.,"that thou wishest to protect me (killing Rāma). Methinks, this mighty"
3472,SECTION XLV.,"disaster of Rāma is welcome unto thee, or else why shouldst thou seeing"
3473,SECTION XLV.,"this, speak thus, O Lakshmana. It is not a wonder that an evil desire"
3474,SECTION XLV.,lurks in thee who art a hypocrite and a cruel-hearted enemy. Verily art
3475,SECTION XLV.,"thou a monster of wickedness, that Rāma repairing unto woods, thou hast,"
3476,SECTION XLV.,"being lustful for me, followed him alone. Or hast thou been engaged by"
3477,SECTION XLV.,Bharata to act thus? But thy or Bharata’s intention shall not be
3478,SECTION XLV.,"satisfied, O Saumitre. How shall I desire another man after serving the"
3479,SECTION XLV.,lotus-eyed Rāma of dark blue hue as my husband? I shall renounce my life
3480,SECTION XLV.,"before thee, therefore, O Lakshmana; without Rāma I shall not maintain"
3481,SECTION XLV.,"my being for a moment on this earth."" Hearing these brazen words of"
3482,SECTION XLV.,"Sitā, capable of making one’s down stand on end, the self-controlled"
3483,SECTION XLV.,"Lakshmana with joined hands spake unto her saying ""Thou art a very"
3484,SECTION XLV.,"Goddess unto me, I therefore dare not answer thee. What thou hast"
3485,SECTION XLV.,"spoken, O Maithelee, is nothing surprising for females. Such is the"
3486,SECTION XLV.,"nature of womankind on this earth. Women by nature are crooked, fickle,"
3487,SECTION XLV.,"devoid of religious knowledge, and bring about difference between father"
3488,SECTION XLV.,"and son. O Vaidehi, O daugther of Janaka, truly am I incapable of"
3489,SECTION XLV.,putting up with these words of thine. They have pierced through both of
3490,SECTION XLV.,my ears like a heated _Nārācha_. However the deities ranging in this
3491,SECTION XLV.,woodland are my witnesses— may they hear thee. I spoke what was fair and
3492,SECTION XLV.,have been thus addressed by thee with these harsh words. I do alawys
3493,SECTION XLV.,obey my superior’s commands. Fie on thee! Thy destruction is near at
3494,SECTION XLV.,"hand that dost thou suspect me, being influenced by this womanish"
3495,SECTION XLV.,"nature. I shall go where Kākuthstha is, may good betide thee, O thou the"
3496,SECTION XLV.,"best of damsels! May the deities of the forest protect thee, O thou of"
3497,SECTION XLV.,expansive eyes! Many a bad omen appear before me. May I see thee again
3498,SECTION XLV.,"when I shall come back with Rāma."" Being thus accosted by Lakshmana the"
3499,SECTION XLV.,"daughter of Janaka replied weeping and being bathed in tears. ""Without"
3500,SECTION XLV.,"Rāma, O Lakshmana, I shall drink virulent poison, enter fire or dive"
3501,SECTION XLV.,into the Godaveri. I shall destroy this body either by hanging or by
3502,SECTION XLV.,falling down from the top of a high object. I shall never be able to
3503,SECTION XLV.,"touch another man but Rāma."" Speaking thus unto Lakshmana, Sitā, being"
3504,SECTION XLV.,"enveloped with grief, weeping, struck her belly⁵⁶ with her hands. Seeing"
3505,SECTION XLV.,"the daughter of Janaka of expansive eyes weep thus in pitiable accents,"
3506,SECTION XLV.,Lakshmana losing his attention began to console her. Afterwards the
3507,SECTION XLV.,"pure-hearted Lakshmana, having control over his senses, saluting Sitā"
3508,SECTION XLV.,"with clasped palms and bending low a little proceeded where Rāma was,"
3509,SECTION XLV.,casting again and again his glance upon her as he went.
3510,SECTION XLV.,
3511,SECTION XLV.,"⁵⁶ Properly it should be ""struck her breast."" But it has a special"
3512,SECTION XLV.,"significance here, i. e.—she would not be satisfied until her"
3513,SECTION XLV.,belly be filled with all the Rākshasas slain.—T.

3520,SECTION XLVI.,Having been addressed with those harsh words the younger brother of
3521,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāghava, enraged, proceeded at once, being anxious to see Rāma."
3522,SECTION XLVI.,"Thereupon the ten-necked one, availing of this opportunity came before"
3523,SECTION XLVI.,Vaidehi assuming the semblance of a mendicant. Wearing a soft silken
3524,SECTION XLVI.,"cloth, with a lock of hair on his head with an umbrella and shoes and"
3525,SECTION XLVI.,"having on his left shoulder a rod and _Kamandalu_, the highly powerful"
3526,SECTION XLVI.,one assuming the appearance of a wandering devotee carrying three long
3527,SECTION XLVI.,bamboo staves appeared before Vaidehi in the forest when there was none
3528,SECTION XLVI.,of the brothers by her. He saw there the young and pious daughter of the
3529,SECTION XLVI.,king like unto an evening void of both sun and moon and as the highly
3530,SECTION XLVI.,terrible Rāhu eyes Rohini forsaken by Moon. Seeing that terrible one the
3531,SECTION XLVI.,"doer of evil deeds, the trees of Janasthāna did not move nor the wind"
3532,SECTION XLVI.,"did blow. Seeing him eye Sitā with his blood-red eyes, the fast"
3533,SECTION XLVI.,streaming river Godaveri even slackened its course out of fear. In the
3534,SECTION XLVI.,"mean time the Ten-necked Rāvana, enquiring about Rāma’s weak points"
3535,SECTION XLVI.,appeared before Vaidehi in the guise of a mendicant. Like unto _Sani_
3536,SECTION XLVI.,"approaching _chitra_, that impious one, assuming the appearance of a"
3537,SECTION XLVI.,"pious man like a well covered with grass, approached Vaidehi who was"
3538,SECTION XLVI.,"bewailing her husband. And seeing that pious spouse of Rāma—Vaidehi,"
3539,SECTION XLVI.,"Rāvana stood before her. Her lips and teeth were extremely fine, her"
3540,SECTION XLVI.,face resembled the full moon and her eyes were like lotus-petals. She
3541,SECTION XLVI.,"had a yellow silken cloth on and sat in the thatched cottage,"
3542,SECTION XLVI.,overwhelmed with grief and bathed in tears. And that ranger of the night
3543,SECTION XLVI.,with a pleased heart approached Vaidehi. Seeing her that Lord of
3544,SECTION XLVI.,Rākshasas was pierced with the shafts of passion. And speaking highly of
3545,SECTION XLVI.,"her, surpassing in beauty the three worlds and resembling by the"
3546,SECTION XLVI.,excellence of her own person the very goddess of wealth herself Rāvana
3547,SECTION XLVI.,"uttering the name of God spake unto her saying, ""O thou having the color"
3548,SECTION XLVI.,"of gold and silver, O thou wearing silken cloth, O thou appearing like a"
3549,SECTION XLVI.,"lotus wearing a garland of lotus-petals, O thou of beautiful"
3550,SECTION XLVI.,"countenance! Art thou Bashfulness, Beauty, Fame, Wealth, Apsara, Dignity"
3551,SECTION XLVI.,or Rati herself who is ranging at will in this forest? All thy teeth are
3552,SECTION XLVI.,"equal having their tops like unto the buds of _Kunda_ flower, beautiful"
3553,SECTION XLVI.,"and yellow. Thy eyes are expansive, clear, of bloody hue, and having"
3554,SECTION XLVI.,black pupils. Thy hip is fleshy and spacious. Thy thighs are like those
3555,SECTION XLVI.,"of elephants, round, fleshy and perfectly strong. Thy nipples are bulky,"
3556,SECTION XLVI.,"pointed, highly captivating like cold palm fruits, beautiful and"
3557,SECTION XLVI.,ornamented with diverse jewels. O thou of beautiful smile! O thou of
3558,SECTION XLVI.,"beautiful teeth! O thou of beautiful eyes! O fine damsel, thou dost"
3559,SECTION XLVI.,carry away my heart like unto a river carrying away its banks by its
3560,SECTION XLVI.,"stream. The lock of thy hair is exquisitely fine, thy breast very close"
3561,SECTION XLVI.,and thy waist is so thin that they may be got round even by fingers.
3562,SECTION XLVI.,"There is none so beautiful like thee—a Goddess, a Gandharbhi, a Yakshi"
3563,SECTION XLVI.,or a Kinnari. I had never seen before on this earth a damsel so
3564,SECTION XLVI.,"beautiful as thou. This thy beauty the best on earth, thy youth, thy"
3565,SECTION XLVI.,grace and thy abode in the forest do agitate my mind. So it is well for
3566,SECTION XLVI.,thee to come (with me); it doth not behove thee to remain here. This is
3567,SECTION XLVI.,the abode of terrible Rākshasas wearing shapes at will. Picturesque
3568,SECTION XLVI.,"palaces, prosperous cities and sweet-smelling gardens are worthy of thy"
3569,SECTION XLVI.,"abode. O thou of dark-blue eyes, fine is thy garland, fine is the smell"
3570,SECTION XLVI.,of thy person and fine is thy apparel—methinks fine is thy husband too.
3571,SECTION XLVI.,"O thou of pure smile! whom dost thou belong to?—Rudras, Marutas, or"
3572,SECTION XLVI.,"Vasus— Meseems, O fine damsel thou art a very gooddes. No one comes"
3573,SECTION XLVI.,"here—the Gandharbas, the celestials or Kinnaras; this is an abode of the"
3574,SECTION XLVI.,Rākshasas; how dost thou come here? Art thou not afraid of these
3575,SECTION XLVI.,"monkeys, lions, tigers, wolves, bears, herons and hyenas? Alone in this"
3576,SECTION XLVI.,"forest, art thou not afraid of these terrible elephants of fierce motion"
3577,SECTION XLVI.,and maddened with the exuding of their temporal juice? Who art thou?
3578,SECTION XLVI.,Whose wife? What for dost thou range alone in this forest of Dandaka
3579,SECTION XLVI.,"frequented by terrible Rākshasas?"" Thus addressed was Vaidehi by the"
3580,SECTION XLVI.,vicious-souled Rāvana. Seeing him come under the guise of a twice-born
3581,SECTION XLVI.,"one, Maithelee worshipped him with diverse articles necessary for"
3582,SECTION XLVI.,serving a guest. Offering him a seat first and afterwards inviting him
3583,SECTION XLVI.,"to wash his feet she said unto that one of placid look ""cooked rice is"
3584,SECTION XLVI.,"ready."" Seeing Rāvana approach with _Kamandalu_ and wearing a red cloth"
3585,SECTION XLVI.,"under the guise of a Brahmana, Maithelee could not pass by him any way,"
3586,SECTION XLVI.,and considering him a twice-born one by various signs invited him as if
3587,SECTION XLVI.,"a Brahmana saying, ""O Brahmana, do thou sit on this seat facing the"
3588,SECTION XLVI.,right; do thou take this water (to wash thy feet); do thou enjoy these
3589,SECTION XLVI.,"well-cooked eatables growing in the forest and intended for thee."""
3590,SECTION XLVI.,"Jānaki the wife of Lord of men inviting him thus, Rāvana, casting a look"
3591,SECTION XLVI.,"upon her, addressed himself for his own destruction, to carry her away."
3592,SECTION XLVI.,She was anxiously expecting the return of Rāma who had gone a-hunting
3593,SECTION XLVI.,with Lakshmana; she looked around and behold but on all sides the
3594,SECTION XLVI.,spacious yellow forest-land—there was neither Rāma nor Lakshmana.

3603,SECTION XLVII.,"guest and a Bhahmin; he may curse me if I do not speak to him."" Thinking"
3604,SECTION XLVII.,"this for a moment Sitā said ""May good betide thee! I am the daughter of"
3605,SECTION XLVII.,"the high-souled Janaka, the king of Mithilā, the beloved Queen of Rāma"
3606,SECTION XLVII.,and my name is Sitā. Dwelling in the palace of Ikshakus for twelve
3607,SECTION XLVII.,"years, I enjoyed many things passing human and had all my desires"
3608,SECTION XLVII.,satisfied. On the thirteenth year king (Daçaratha) counselled with his
3609,SECTION XLVII.,ministers about the installation of Rāma. Accordingly everything
3610,SECTION XLVII.,"necessary for the installation being made ready, Kaikeyi, one of my"
3611,SECTION XLVII.,"mothers-in-law, begged of her husband a boon. Bringing my father-in-law"
3612,SECTION XLVII.,"under control by means of her virtuous deeds, Kaikeyi begged, of that"
3613,SECTION XLVII.,"truthful, best of monarchs, two boons namely the exile of my husband"
3614,SECTION XLVII.,"into the woods and the installation of Bharata, and said ""I shall never"
3615,SECTION XLVII.,"eat, drink or sleep and (if Rāma be installed) I shall end my life."""
3616,SECTION XLVII.,"Kaikeyi speaking thus, that lord of earth, my father-in-law begged her"
3617,SECTION XLVII.,to accept diverse riches; but Kaikeyi did not agree. Then the highly
3618,SECTION XLVII.,"effulgent Rāma, my husband was twenty-five years old, and myself was"
3619,SECTION XLVII.,eighteen years old counting from my birth. My husband is known all over
3620,SECTION XLVII.,"the world under the name of Rāma. He is truthful, good-natured, of pure"
3621,SECTION XLVII.,"character, ever engaged in the welfare of all created beings, of"
3622,SECTION XLVII.,mighty-arms and expansive eyes. Our father the king Daçaratha was
3623,SECTION XLVII.,"entirely under the control of passions, and hence for the satisfaction"
3624,SECTION XLVII.,of Kaikeyi did not install Rāma. When Rāma came to his father for being
3625,SECTION XLVII.,"installed Kaikeyi spoke unto my husband the following cruel words, ""Do"
3626,SECTION XLVII.,"thou hear, O Rāghava, how I have been ordered by thy Sire. This kingdom,"
3627,SECTION XLVII.,"rid of thorns is to be conferred on Bharata, and thou shalt have to"
3628,SECTION XLVII.,sojourn into woods for years nine and five. Do thou therefore repair
3629,SECTION XLVII.,"unto forest, O Kākuthstha and save thy Sire from untruth."" Whereto Rāma"
3630,SECTION XLVII.,fearlessly replied ’So be it!’ Hearing her words my husband of firm vows
3631,SECTION XLVII.,acted accordingly. He always maketh gifts and taketh none. He always
3632,SECTION XLVII.,speaketh truth and never telleth an untruth. This is his best
3633,SECTION XLVII.,"observance, O Brahmana. His half-brother named Lakshmana is of mighty"
3634,SECTION XLVII.,prowess. That best of men is Rāma’s help and the destroyer of foes in
3635,SECTION XLVII.,battle. That brother of his named Lakshmana is of firm resolution and
3636,SECTION XLVII.,given to asceticism. With a bow in hand he hath followed (Rāma) flying
3637,SECTION XLVII.,as an exile unto woods along with me. Thus that one (Rāma) of firm
3638,SECTION XLVII.,resolution and ever engaged in pious offices wearing matted hair and
3639,SECTION XLVII.,assuming the semblance of an ascetic hath entered this forest of Dandaka
3640,SECTION XLVII.,along with myself and his younger brother. O thou the best of twice-born
3641,SECTION XLVII.,"ones, we three being deprived of our kingdom by Kaikeyi have been living"
3642,SECTION XLVII.,in this dense forest by virtue of our effulgence. Do thou take heart for
3643,SECTION XLVII.,a moment and live here. Instantly shall my husband return with good many
3644,SECTION XLVII.,wild fruits and roots and with sufficient meat after killing many a
3645,SECTION XLVII.,"deer, hog and _Gosamp_. Truly do thou relate unto me thy name, _Gotra_"
3646,SECTION XLVII.,"and lineage. O thou twice-born one, why dost thou range alone in this"
3647,SECTION XLVII.,"forest of Dandaka?"" Sitā the wife of Rāma speaking thus, the mighty Lord"
3648,SECTION XLVII.,"of Rākshasas—Rāvana replied with these harsh words—""0 Sitā I am that"
3649,SECTION XLVII.,"Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, whom fear the celestials, Asuras and"

3652,SECTION XLVII.,"beautiful damsel from various quarters, do thou become my foremost Queen"
3653,SECTION XLVII.,"amongst them. That great city in the midst of the ocean, Lankā,"
3654,SECTION XLVII.,"encircled on all sides by the sea and situated on the summit of a hill,"
3655,SECTION XLVII.,"is my capital. There shalt thou with me, Sitā, walk in gardens, and thus"

3657,SECTION XLVII.,"wife, O Sitā, five thousand maid-servants decorated with divers"
3658,SECTION XLVII.,"ornaments shall serve thee."" That blameless daughter of Janaka, being"
3659,SECTION XLVII.,"thus addressed by Rāvana, was highly enraged, and, passing by him,"
3660,SECTION XLVII.,"replied, ""I am a dependant ot Rāma, who is incapable of being shaken,"
3661,SECTION XLVII.,"like unto a mighty mountain, incapable of being agitated, like unto a"

3664,SECTION XLVII.,"like unto a fig tree. I am dependant of that lion among men, Rāma, of"
3665,SECTION XLVII.,"mighty arms, of a spacious breast and treading like a lion, I am a"
3666,SECTION XLVII.,"dependant of that son of a king, Rāma, of mighty arms, having control"
3667,SECTION XLVII.,"over his passions, whose face resembles the full moon and whose fame"
3668,SECTION XLVII.,hath spread far and wide over the earth. Why dost thou being a tiger
3669,SECTION XLVII.,wish for a she-lion? Thou shalt not be able to touch me like unto the
3670,SECTION XLVII.,"rays of the sun. O thou wretched Rākshasa, when thou hast desired to"
3671,SECTION XLVII.,"steal away Rāghava’s beloved spouse, surely dost thou see these trees"
3672,SECTION XLVII.,(before thee) as made of gold. Dost thou wish to uproot the teeth from
3673,SECTION XLVII.,"the mouth of a lion, that enemy of deer, or from that of a serpent? Dost"
3674,SECTION XLVII.,"thou wish to clasp with thy hands the Mandara hill, or dost thou wish to"
3675,SECTION XLVII.,walk in peace after drinking poison? Dost thou wish to rub thy eyes with
3676,SECTION XLVII.,pins and lick a razor with thy tongue? Thou dost wish to swim across an
3677,SECTION XLVII.,"ocean, having a rock tied unto thy neck. Thou dost wish to get at the"
3678,SECTION XLVII.,"Sun and Moon, to bind a flaming fire with a piece of cloth and walk"
3679,SECTION XLVII.,"through iron-spikes, as thou hast wished to come by the worthy spouse of"
3680,SECTION XLVII.,"Rāma. Mighty is the difference between Rāma and thee, like unto that"
3681,SECTION XLVII.,"between a lion and a jackal, a sea and a rivulet, nectar and gruel, gold"
3682,SECTION XLVII.,"and iron, sandal and mud, an elephant and a cat, a crow and Garuda, a"
3683,SECTION XLVII.,"peacock and a _madgie_ (an acquatic bird), or a duck and a vulture. Even"
3684,SECTION XLVII.,"if thou dost steal me, that mighty archer Rāma, gifted with the prowess"
3685,SECTION XLVII.,"of the lord of celestials, living, surely shall I die, like unto a gnat"
3686,SECTION XLVII.,"sucking clarified butter."" Addressing those words unto that wicked"

3704,SECTION XLVIII.,"Thereat, that one carried by men, renouncing out of my fear this wealthy"

3713,SECTION XLVIII.,even the leaves of the trees do not flutter and the currents of the
3714,SECTION XLVIII.,rivers are stopped. Beyond the ocean stands my beautiful capital Lankā
3715,SECTION XLVIII.,"like unto Indra’s Amarāvati, (the capital of the Lord of celestials),"

3721,SECTION XLVIII.,"Sitā, O thou the daughter of a king, in this city shalt thou dwell with"
3722,SECTION XLVIII.,"me. O large-minded damsel, thou shalt never think of earthly women. O"

3724,SECTION XLVIII.,"human, thou shalt not any more think of Rāma—a human being of brief"
3725,SECTION XLVIII.,"existence. Placing his beloved son on the throne, king Daçaratha hath"

3735,SECTION XLVIII.,"Being thus addressed by him, Vaidehi exceedingly wroth and with"

3738,SECTION XLVIII.,after introducing as thy brother that highly worshipful Kuvera adored by
3739,SECTION XLVIII.,"all the deities. O Rāvana, surely shall all the Rākshasas meet with"
3740,SECTION XLVIII.,"death, who have such a stupid, harsh and lustful person like thee for"
3741,SECTION XLVIII.,"their king. One can breathe on this earth carrying away Indra’s wife,"
3742,SECTION XLVIII.,"Sachi—but stealing me, the wife of Rāma, no body shall be able to live"
3743,SECTION XLVIII.,"in peace. O Rākshasa, it might be possible for one to live on this earth"
3744,SECTION XLVIII.,"treating contemptuously the wife of the holder of thunder-bolt, but"
3745,SECTION XLVIII.,insulting me none shall escape the hands of Death even if he drinketh

3753,SECTION XLIX.,Hearing those words of Sitā the highly powerful Ten-necked one striking
3754,SECTION XLIX.,"his hands together, increased his body too high. Thereupon, that one"
3755,SECTION XLIX.,"skilled in speech again spake unto Maithilee, ""Methinks thou hast run"
3756,SECTION XLIX.,mad. Hast thou not heard of my valour and prowess? Stationing myself in
3757,SECTION XLIX.,the welkin I can with my hands raise up the earth. I can drink up the
3758,SECTION XLIX.,waters of the ocean. And engaged in conflict I can destroy Death itself.
3759,SECTION XLIX.,With my sharpened shafts I can pierce the Sun and cut asunder the earth.
3760,SECTION XLIX.,"Thou art mad with thy beauty. Do thou look upon me, who am capable of"
3761,SECTION XLIX.,"illusions."" When he had spoken thus, his yellow eyes became blood-red"
3762,SECTION XLIX.,"with rage and assumed the semblance of flaming fire. Thereat Rāvana, the"
3763,SECTION XLIX.,"younger brother of the Lord of wealth, changing his placid countenance,"
3764,SECTION XLIX.,instantly assumed his own terrible shape resembling that of Yama. Highly
3765,SECTION XLIX.,"exercised with ire, that ranger of the night became of ten countenances"
3766,SECTION XLIX.,and twenty arms; his eyes were bloody and he appeared beautiful like
3767,SECTION XLIX.,"unto blue clouds, being dressed in gold-hued apparel. Leaving aside the"
3768,SECTION XLIX.,"semblance of a mendicant, that lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana, increasing in"
3769,SECTION XLIX.,"bulk, assumed his own shape. And wearing a blood-red cloth he stood"
3770,SECTION XLIX.,there fixing his look upon that jewel of a damsel—Maithili. Thereupon
3771,SECTION XLIX.,"Rāvana spake unto Maithili like unto the rays of the sun, having a head"
3772,SECTION XLIX.,"of black hair and wearing apparel and ornaments, saying, ""O thou fine"
3773,SECTION XLIX.,"damsel, if thou dost wish to have a husband known all over the world, do"
3774,SECTION XLIX.,thou surrender thyself unto me. I am a worthy husband (or thee. Do thou
3775,SECTION XLIX.,"serve me for ever, thy praiseworthy husband. O fine lady, I shall never"
3776,SECTION XLIX.,"do what thou dost not like. Renouncing thy attachment for a man, do thou"
3777,SECTION XLIX.,"place thy love in me. O foolish girl, worthy of being adored by the"
3778,SECTION XLIX.,"learned, for what quality art thou attached unto Rāma of a limited life,"
3779,SECTION XLIX.,"who hath been deprived of his kingdom and hath his desire frustrated,"
3780,SECTION XLIX.,"and who of an evil intent, hath, at the words of his wife, renouncing"
3781,SECTION XLIX.,"his kingdom and kinsmen, been living in this forest—the abode of"
3782,SECTION XLIX.,"voracious animals."" Speaking thus unto Maithili, sweet-speeched and"
3783,SECTION XLIX.,"worthy of being sweetly addressed, that highly wicked Rākshasa, Rāvana,"
3784,SECTION XLIX.,"being exercised with lust, approached towards Sitā and got hold of her,"
3785,SECTION XLIX.,like unto Budha holding Rohini in the sky. With his left hand he held
3786,SECTION XLIX.,"her, having eyes like unto lotus-petals, by the hair, and with his right"
3787,SECTION XLIX.,"hand got hold of her thighs. Seeing Rāvana of sharpened teeth, and"
3788,SECTION XLIX.,"mighty arms, resembling the summit of a mountain and like unto death"
3789,SECTION XLIX.,"itself, the deties of the forest became highly terrified and fled in"
3790,SECTION XLIX.,different directions. Instantly appeared there the celestial car of
3791,SECTION XLIX.,"Rāvana, decked in gold, drawn by asses and making a terrible sound."
3792,SECTION XLIX.,"Thereupon, that one emmiting terrible accents, remonstrated with Vaidehi"
3793,SECTION XLIX.,"in harsh words and clasping her ascended the car. The virtuous Sitā,"
3794,SECTION XLIX.,"being thus caught by Rāvana,began to cry aloud, addressing Rāma, who had"
3795,SECTION XLIX.,"gone away to a distant forest. Rāvana, racked with lust, rose high up"
3796,SECTION XLIX.,"with her like unto the wife of a _Pannaga_, though she tried her best"
3797,SECTION XLIX.,"(to get rid of him), for she was not in the least attached unto him."
3798,SECTION XLIX.,"Being thus carried away by the ethereal track by that Lord of Rākshasas,"
3799,SECTION XLIX.,"Sitā began to cry aloud, like one mad, distressed and of deranged"
3800,SECTION XLIX.,"senses. ""Ah! mighty Lakshmana, ever ministering unto the satisfaction of"
3801,SECTION XLIX.,"thy superiors, dost thou not know that I have been stolen away by a"
3802,SECTION XLIX.,"Rākshasa assuming shapes at will? O Rāghava, for virtue hast thou"
3803,SECTION XLIX.,"renounced thy life, happiness and wealth,—dost thou not see that I have"
3804,SECTION XLIX.,been carried away by one of mighty iniquity? O thou the subduer of
3805,SECTION XLIX.,"foes,thou dost always control the rebellious,—why dost thou not punish"
3806,SECTION XLIX.,such a vicious Rākshasa? The vicious do not instantaneously meet with
3807,SECTION XLIX.,the fruits of their actions; as for corn to ripen requires the
3808,SECTION XLIX.,"assistance of time. For this iniquitous deed, which thou hast"
3809,SECTION XLIX.,"perpetrated, availing of the time and losing thy sense, thou shalt meet"
3810,SECTION XLIX.,"with a mighty disaster from Rāma, bringing about thy end. Ah! being the"
3811,SECTION XLIX.,"virtuous wife of the virtuous and far-famed Rāma, I have been stolen"
3812,SECTION XLIX.,away. Now hath the desire of Kaikeyi and other relations been fulfilled.
3813,SECTION XLIX.,I invoke this Janasthāna and these flowery Karnikās to tell Rāma that
3814,SECTION XLIX.,"Rāvana hath stolen away Sitā. I invoke thee, O Godavari, having swans"
3815,SECTION XLIX.,"and cranes sporting in thy stream, to tell Rāma that Rāvana hath stolen"
3816,SECTION XLIX.,away Sitā. I salute and invoke the deities that live in this forest of
3817,SECTION XLIX.,many trees to tell my husband of my being stolen away (by Rāvana). I do
3818,SECTION XLIX.,"seek the refuge of all deer, birds and other animals that live in this"
3819,SECTION XLIX.,"forest, and may they all communicate unto Rāma the news of his dear"
3820,SECTION XLIX.,"spouse being carried away, and tell him that Sitā, losing her control,"
3821,SECTION XLIX.,"hath been stolen away by Rāvana. Even if I am taken away by Yama, and if"
3822,SECTION XLIX.,"the mighty-armed Rāma is apprised of it, surely shall he bring me back"
3823,SECTION XLIX.,"by the display of his prowess."" Racked with sorrow that one of expansive"
3824,SECTION XLIX.,"eyes, while thus bewailing in piteous accents, she espied Yatāyu, the"
3825,SECTION XLIX.,"king of vultures, seated on a tree. Thereat the daughter of Janaka,"
3826,SECTION XLIX.,"brought under the control of Rāvana and terrified, began to cry and"
3827,SECTION XLIX.,"utter those piteous words—""O worshipful Yatāyu, do thou see that this"
3828,SECTION XLIX.,vicious lord of Rākshasas hath ruthlessly carried me away like one
3829,SECTION XLIX.,"having no husband. Thou wilt not be able to withstand this mighty,"
3830,SECTION XLIX.,wicked and cruel night-ranger wearing emblems of conquest and having a
3831,SECTION XLIX.,scimitar in his hand. Do thou relate unto Rāma and to Lakshmana

4032,SECTION LII.,hill aflame with fire. And coppery fragrant lotus-leaves belonging to
4033,SECTION LII.,the eminently auspicious Vaidehi showered upon Rāvana. And her
4034,SECTION LII.,"gold-glowing silken cloth, flying in the air, appeared like clouds"
4035,SECTION LII.,colored by the sunken sun. And her blameless countenance on Rāvana’s lap
4036,SECTION LII.,"in the sky did not appear beauteous without Rāma,—like a lotus without"
4037,SECTION LII.,its stalk; it appeared like the moon risen tearing away dark clouds. And
4038,SECTION LII.,in the aerial regions her countenance on Rāvana’s lap furnished with a
4039,SECTION LII.,"fair forehead and graceful hair glowing like the interior of a lotus,"
4040,SECTION LII.,"without scars, graced with white, shining, stainless teeth, having"
4041,SECTION LII.,"excellent eyes,—lovely like the moon, having a shapely nose, a rubeous"
4042,SECTION LII.,"upper lip,—wearing the splendour of gold in the sky,—that captivating"
4043,SECTION LII.,"countenance of hers in consequence of her weeping, and of being stained"
4044,SECTION LII.,"with tears, as also owing to the violence it had undergone at the hands"
4045,SECTION LII.,of the lord of Rākshasas—did not appear beautiful without Rāma; like the
4046,SECTION LII.,"moon risen during the day. And furnished with the hue of gold, Mithilā’s"
4047,SECTION LII.,"daughter beside the dark-bodied lord of the Rākshasas, looked like a"
4048,SECTION LII.,"golden girth round a sable elephant. And Janaka’s daughter, yellow-hued"
4049,SECTION LII.,"like lotus, having the lustre of gold.—and adorned with shining"
4050,SECTION LII.,"ornaments, coming in contact with Rāvana, appeared like lightning"
4051,SECTION LII.,embosomed among clouds. And in consequence of Vaidehi’s ornaments
4052,SECTION LII.,"sending sounds, the lord of Rākshasas resembled an entirely dark"
4053,SECTION LII.,"rumbling cloud. And as Sitā was being borne away, showers of blossoms,"
4054,SECTION LII.,"falling off from her head, were scattered all around on the earth"
4055,SECTION LII.,"beneath. And that blossomy shower all around, drawn up by the vehemence"
4056,SECTION LII.,"of the ten-headed Rāvana, again alighted beside him. And the showers of"
4057,SECTION LII.,"blossoms scattered around Vaiçravana’s younger brother, looked like rows"
4058,SECTION LII.,of burning stars round the foremost of mountains.⁵⁸ And the bangles
4059,SECTION LII.,"studded with gems, loosened from Vaidehi’s feet, fell on the earth, like"
4060,SECTION LII.,"the lightning circle.⁵⁹ Of hue like the light red of tender twigs,"
4061,SECTION LII.,"Vaidehi set off the dark-bodied lord of Rākshasas, as does a golden"
4062,SECTION LII.,"cover an elephant. Vaiçravana’s younger brother carried away Sitā, who,"
4063,SECTION LII.,"like a mighty meteor, filled the heavens with her splendour. And like"
4064,SECTION LII.,"stars of exhausted religious merit dropping down from the sky, her fiery"
4065,SECTION LII.,ornaments began to fall to the earth with sounds. And the chain of the
4066,SECTION LII.,"splendour of the moon, removed from Vaidehi’s breast, falling down,"
4067,SECTION LII.,shone like the Gangā dropping from the sky. The trees filled with
4068,SECTION LII.,"various fowls, with their tops waving because of the wind blowing on"
4069,SECTION LII.,"high and swaying them, seemed to say, ""No fear,"" [unto Sitā.] And the"
4070,SECTION LII.,"pools with their lotuses faded and their fishes agitated, seemed to"
4071,SECTION LII.,sorrow for the desponding daughter of Mithilā as for their friend. And
4072,SECTION LII.,"following Sitā’s shadow, lions, and tigers, and other beasts and birds,"
4073,SECTION LII.,"rushed from all sides in wrath. And the mountains, with their faces"
4074,SECTION LII.,"washed with water-falls representing tears, and their summits resembling"
4075,SECTION LII.,"uplifted arms, seemed to lament for Sitā, as she was being carried away."
4076,SECTION LII.,"And beholding Vaidehi carried away, the glorious Sun, oppressed with"
4077,SECTION LII.,"sadness, had his rays dimmed and his disc darkened. ""Virtue is not; and"
4078,SECTION LII.,"where is truth? And there is neither sincerity nor kindness,—in a case"
4079,SECTION LII.,in which Rāvana is carrying away Rāma’s Vaidehi thus did all creatures
4080,SECTION LII.,"lament in numbers. And the young of deer, afflicted with fear, wept with"
4081,SECTION LII.,"woe-begone faces. And the sylvan deities, looking up now and again with"
4082,SECTION LII.,"eyes betokening fear, had their persons all in a tremble. For compassing"
4083,SECTION LII.,"his own destruction, the Ten-headed one carried away the intelligent"
4084,SECTION LII.,"Vaidehi, bewailing bitterly, Sitā, who had come by such misfortune,"
4085,SECTION LII.,"sweet-voiced, crying, ""O Lakshmana"" ""O Rāma,"" and casting glances on the"
4086,SECTION LII.,"ground many a time and oft,—the ends of her hair waving and her _tilika_"
4087,SECTION LII.,"wiped out. Then oppressed with the load of fear, Sitā of luminous"
4088,SECTION LII.,"smiles,—Mithilā’ s daughter, bereft of her friends —not beholding either"
4089,SECTION LII.,"Rāma or Lakshmana, became pale of countenance."

4103,SECTION LIII.,"possessed her. Her eyes expressing rage, weeping and fright, Sitā, as"
4104,SECTION LIII.,"she was being carried away, weeping piteously, spoke to the grim-eyed"
4105,SECTION LIII.,"lord of the Rākshasas, saying, ""Dost thou not, O base wretch, Rāvana,"
4106,SECTION LIII.,"feel shame on account of this act—thou, who, knowing that I was alone,"
4107,SECTION LIII.,"fliest away, carrying me? Coward that thou art, thou it was, who,"
4108,SECTION LIII.,"desirous of carrying me off, by the shape of a deer, hadst, by thy"
4109,SECTION LIII.,[powers of] illusion taken away my lord. And he also that endeavoured to
4110,SECTION LIII.,"rescue me, has been slain by thee—the ancient king of vultures, who was"
4111,SECTION LIII.,"the friend of my father-in-law. Great, forsooth, is found to be thy"
4112,SECTION LIII.,"might, thou vilest of Rākshasas; in that thou hast carried me off by"
4113,SECTION LIII.,"simply declaring thy name, but hast not won me in war. Why dost thou"
4114,SECTION LIII.,"not, O execrable one, take shame unto thyself, having perpetrated such a"
4115,SECTION LIII.,heinous act—having carried off another’s wife in the absence of her
4116,SECTION LIII.,"husband? This fell and foul act of thine fraught with unrighteousness,"
4117,SECTION LIII.,heroic persons shall bruit about the world. Fie on thy heroism and thy
4118,SECTION LIII.,"truth,—of which thou didst apeak at that time; and fie also on this"
4119,SECTION LIII.,"character of thine, calculated to sully thy line in this world. What can"
4120,SECTION LIII.,"I do (unto thee), as thou proceedest with speed? But stay thou for a"
4121,SECTION LIII.,moment; and thou shalt not return with life. Shouldst thou come within
4122,SECTION LIII.,"the range of the vision of those sons of the king, thou couldst not,"
4123,SECTION LIII.,"although thou shouldst happen to be accompanied with thy army, live for"
4124,SECTION LIII.,a moment. Even as a bird cannot bear the touch of a flaming fire in a
4125,SECTION LIII.,"forest, thou canst never bear the touch of their arrows. Effecting thy"
4126,SECTION LIII.,"own welfare, do thou, O Rāvana, leave me. If thou do not let me go, my"
4127,SECTION LIII.,husband along with his brother would strive for thy destruction. As
4128,SECTION LIII.,"intent upon sensul enjoyment, thou endeavourest to ravish me, this very"
4129,SECTION LIII.,"endeavour of thine, O mean wight, shall come to naught. Not beholding my"
4130,SECTION LIII.,"lord resembling a celestial, I cannot, come under the sway of my enemy,"
4131,SECTION LIII.,bear to live long. As one dwelling on earth perceives objects in their
4132,SECTION LIII.,"reversed relations at the time of one’s death, so thou dost not perceive"
4133,SECTION LIII.,what is for thy good or profit. Those moribund do not relish what would
4134,SECTION LIII.,do them good. I see thee with the noose of Death wound round thy neck.
4135,SECTION LIII.,"As, O ranger of night, thou art not affected with fear, albeit the"
4136,SECTION LIII.,"situation is one calculated to raise one’s apprehensions, it is clear"
4137,SECTION LIII.,"that thou wilt see the golden trees, the dreadful river Vaitarani"
4138,SECTION LIII.,"flowing with blood, the terrible wood, O Rāvana, rife with leaves in the"
4139,SECTION LIII.,"shape of swords, and a sharp Sālmali containing blossoms of shining"
4140,SECTION LIII.,"gold, having lapises for its leaves, and bearing iron thorns. But, O"
4141,SECTION LIII.,"shameless one, like a person that hath drunk poison, having done this"
4142,SECTION LIII.,"wrong unto that high-souled one, thou wilt not be able to save thyself."
4143,SECTION LIII.,"O Rāvana, thou art fast fettered in the noose of Death. Having done this"
4144,SECTION LIII.,"foul turn unto that high-souled one, repairing whither, shalt thou"
4145,SECTION LIII.,"obtain respite? Shall not that strong and heroic Rāghava, skilled in all"
4146,SECTION LIII.,"weapons, who without his brother, in the twinkling of an eye, in battle"
4147,SECTION LIII.,"slew fourteen thousand Rākshasas, slay thee, who carriest away his"

4149,SECTION LIII.,"lap of Rāvana, overwhelmed with fear and grief, indulged in piteous"
4150,SECTION LIII.,lamentations. And the wicked (Rāvana) with a shaking frame carried away
4151,SECTION LIII.,"the daughter of the king extremely distressed, speaking much, and"
4152,SECTION LIII.,"speaking piteously, uttering lamentations, and putting forth endeavours"

4160,SECTION LIV.,"Carried away (by Rāvana), Vaidehi, not finding any defender, saw five"

4162,SECTION LIV.,"expansive eyes and surpassing charms, in the hope that they might convey"
4163,SECTION LIV.,"the intelligence unto Rāma, flung off in their midst her gold-gleaming"
4164,SECTION LIV.,"silken sheet, and elegant ornaments. But the Ten headed one owing to"
4165,SECTION LIV.,hurry did not observe the throwing of the cloth along with the
4166,SECTION LIV.,ornaments. Those foremost of monkeys having tawny eyes observed with
4167,SECTION LIV.,winkless eyes the large-eyed Sitā as she was giving way to grief. And
4168,SECTION LIV.,"the lord of Rākshasas, passing beyond Pampā, directed his course towards"
4169,SECTION LIV.,"the city of Lankā, taking Mithilā’s daughter along with him, indulging"
4170,SECTION LIV.,"in lamentations. Experiencing the height of delight, Rāvana ravished"
4171,SECTION LIV.,"her, taking her on his lap, like a sharp-toothed serpent of virulent"
4172,SECTION LIV.,"poison. And speedily, like an arrow shot from a bow, he, coursing the"

4174,SECTION LIV.,"And coming to the abode of Varuna, that refuge of rivers, the"
4175,SECTION LIV.,"exhaustless ocean—the home of whales and alligators, he crossed over it."
4176,SECTION LIV.,"In consequence of the carrying away of Vaidehi, Varuna’s abode, from"
4177,SECTION LIV.,"grief, had all its waves stilled and its fishes and mighty snakes"
4178,SECTION LIV.,"inert.—And the Chāranas uttered in the heavens these words, ""O"
4179,SECTION LIV.,"Ten-headed one, this is thy end."" Thus did the Siddhas then say. And"
4180,SECTION LIV.,"taking Siti on his lap, representing his own Death,—who endeavoured (to"
4181,SECTION LIV.,"liberate herself), Rāvana entered the city of Lankā. And entering the"
4182,SECTION LIV.,"city of Lankā, vast, with all its highways well-arranged, and with"
4183,SECTION LIV.,"people thronging its gates, he entered his own inner apartment. Then"
4184,SECTION LIV.,"Rāvana set Sitā there, having eyes with dark outer corners, exercised"
4185,SECTION LIV.,with grief and dole; as if Maya had set his own Asura Illusion (in his
4186,SECTION LIV.,own palace). Then the Ten-headed one spoke unto some female friends of
4187,SECTION LIV.,"terrible visages, ""Let no man or woman behold Sitā without my"
4188,SECTION LIV.,"permission. And I command that, should she ask for pearls, or rubies, or"
4189,SECTION LIV.,"gold, or apparel, or ornaments, the same should be rendered unto her."
4190,SECTION LIV.,"She that, whether knowingly or unknowingly should say anything"
4191,SECTION LIV.,"unpleasant to Vaidehi, would hold her life cheap."" Having said this unto"
4192,SECTION LIV.,"the Rākshasis, the puissant lord of the Rāksahsas, went out of the inner"
4193,SECTION LIV.,"apartment, and thought within himself as to what was to be done (next)."
4194,SECTION LIV.,And he saw eight flesh-eating Rākshasas of wondrous prowess. And seeing
4195,SECTION LIV.,"them, the exceedingly powerful (Rāvana), blinded by the bestowal of the"
4196,SECTION LIV.,"boon, after extolling their strength and heroism, addressed them,"
4197,SECTION LIV.,"saying, ""Equipped with various weapons, do ye speedily take yourself to"
4198,SECTION LIV.,"Janasthāna,— that field of carnage—which ere this contained the abode of"
4199,SECTION LIV.,"Khara; and casting off fear at a distance, do ye sojourn in vacant"
4200,SECTION LIV.,Janasthāna with all its Rākshasas slain (by Rāma). A great many troops
4201,SECTION LIV.,"endeued with exceeding prowess, who had been posted in Janasthāna, have,"
4202,SECTION LIV.,"along with Dushana and Khara, been slain by the shafts of Rāma. Hence"
4203,SECTION LIV.,"unprecedented is my wrath, towering above my patience; and great and"
4204,SECTION LIV.,fierce also is the hostility I have conceived against Rāma. I wish to
4205,SECTION LIV.,avenge myself on my mighty enemy. Sleep find I none without slaying my
4206,SECTION LIV.,"foe in fight. Slaying that slayer of Khara and Dushana, Rāma, I shall"
4207,SECTION LIV.,attain delight like unto that attained by a pauper on gaining riches.
4208,SECTION LIV.,"Staying in Janasthāna, ye shall gather true information touching Rāma as"
4209,SECTION LIV.,"to what he is about. Repair all ye rangers of the night carefully, and"
4210,SECTION LIV.,strive yourselves always for slaying Rāma. I have been well acquainted
4211,SECTION LIV.,"with your strength in many a field, and it is for this that I set ye in"
4212,SECTION LIV.,"Janasthāna."" Hearing these agreeable and weighty words of Rāvana, those"
4213,SECTION LIV.,"Rākshasas, bowing down unto Rāvana, left Lankā, and in a body invisibly"
4214,SECTION LIV.,proceeded in the direction of Janasthāna. Having obtained Mithilā’s
4215,SECTION LIV.,"daughter, Rāvana experienced great joy in establishing her (in his own"
4216,SECTION LIV.,"house); and having created high hostility with Rāma, Rāvana through"
4217,SECTION LIV.,blindness rejoiced greatly.

4227,SECTION LV.,"of Kāma, hastily entered his charming mansion, with the intention of"
4228,SECTION LV.,"seeing Sitā. And entering that apartment, Rāvana—lord of Rākshasas—saw"

4230,SECTION LV.,"countenance, oppressed with a load of grief, like unto a bark sinking in"
4231,SECTION LV.,the ocean through the violence of the winds; like unto a doe separated

4233,SECTION LV.,"disconsolate in consequence of stress of sorrow, remaining with her head"
4234,SECTION LV.,"bent down, that ranger of the night, the lord of the Rākshasas, forcibly"
4235,SECTION LV.,"shewed unto her that mansion resembling the mansion of the celestials,"
4236,SECTION LV.,"thick with palaces and lordly piles, inhabited by thousands of females;"
4237,SECTION LV.,containing birds of vaious kinds; furnished with various gems; with
4238,SECTION LV.,"beautiful pillars of ivory gold and crystal and silver, studded with"
4239,SECTION LV.,diamonds and lapises. Rāvana in company with Sitā ascended the beautiful
4240,SECTION LV.,"golden stairs, resounding with the sounds of kettle-drums and"
4241,SECTION LV.,embellished with ornaments of burnished gold. And those loftly edifices
4242,SECTION LV.,"had excellent windows made of ivory and silver, and covered with golden"
4243,SECTION LV.,nets. The ground all over was decorated with ambrosia and gems. The
4244,SECTION LV.,Ten-headed one in his own mansion shewed unto Maithilee large tanks and
4245,SECTION LV.,pools covered with various kinds of flowers. (All this) Rāvana shewed
4246,SECTION LV.,unto Sitā overmastered by sorrow. And after having shewed unto Vaidehi
4247,SECTION LV.,"the whole of that goodliest of mansions, that wicked one, with the"
4248,SECTION LV.,"intention of tempting Sitā, spoke unto her, saying, ""O Sitā, leaving out"
4249,SECTION LV.,"old men and boys, I am the lord of thirty two _kotis_ of night-rangers"
4250,SECTION LV.,of terrible deeds. And a thousand come forward whenever required for any
4251,SECTION LV.,"service.—If such is my sovereignty, all this is established in thee, O"
4252,SECTION LV.,"large-eyed lady, as well as my life. Thou art dearer unto me than life."
4253,SECTION LV.,"O Sitā, be thou the mistress of those numerous excellent women who are"

4255,SECTION LV.,act otherwise? Do thou relish my speech. Do thou bend thy mind towards

4260,SECTION LV.,"Serpents, find I any one that can match me in prowess. What wilt thou do"
4261,SECTION LV.,"with Rāma a human being of short life, poor, of small prowess,"
4262,SECTION LV.,"practising mendicancy? O Sitā, bend thy mind unto me. I am a fit husband"
4263,SECTION LV.,"for thee. O timed one, youth is uncertain. Sport with me here. And, O"
4264,SECTION LV.,"thou of a handsome countenance, do not wish for the sight of Rāghava. O"
4265,SECTION LV.,"Sitā, what power hath he to come hither even in thought? None can fetter"
4266,SECTION LV.,"the exceedingly fleet wind in the sky, or hold the bright flame of a"
4267,SECTION LV.,"burning fire. O beauteous one, in these three worlds I find no one that"
4268,SECTION LV.,"can by his might carry thee away, who art protected by my arms. Do thou"
4269,SECTION LV.,govern at Lankā this extensive kingdom. The like of me and celestials
4270,SECTION LV.,and all that are mobile and immobile shall be thy servants. Laving thy
4271,SECTION LV.,"limbs with water, do thou gratify me. The evil that thou hadst done,"
4272,SECTION LV.,hath been expiated by thy life in the forest: now do thou reap the fruit
4273,SECTION LV.,"of thy good deeds. Here are garlands furnished with divine fragrance,"
4274,SECTION LV.,"and, O Maithili, superb ornaments. Enjoy thou all those along with me. O"
4275,SECTION LV.,"thou of shapely hips, the car called Pushpaka, resembling the sun, which"
4276,SECTION LV.,"(formerly) belonged to my brother Vaiçravana, was through my prowess won"
4277,SECTION LV.,by me in fight. And vast and beautiful is that car furnished with the
4278,SECTION LV.,"speed of the mind. Do thou, O Sitā, at thy pleasure sport on it along"
4279,SECTION LV.,"with me. Thy face stainless and lovely to look at, resembling the lotus,"
4280,SECTION LV.,"doth not, O thou of a comely countenance, O magnificent damsel, appear"
4281,SECTION LV.,beautiful in consequence of thy being exercised with grief. When Rāvana
4282,SECTION LV.,"had spoken thus, that best of females Sitā muffling up her moon-like"
4283,SECTION LV.,"countenance with the ends of her cloth, began to shed gentle tears."
4284,SECTION LV.,"Thereat the heroic ranger of the night, Rāvana, said unto Sitā,"
4285,SECTION LV.,"distressed, sunk in thought, and deprived of her splendour through"
4286,SECTION LV.,"anxiety, ""O Vaidehi, banish bashfulness, which stands in the way of"
4287,SECTION LV.,one’s duty. The yearning I feel after thee is in consonance with what
4288,SECTION LV.,the sages prescribe. These tender feet of thine I press upon my heads.

4304,SECTION LVI.,"bridge of righteousness, like unto a mountain, ever bearing regard"
4305,SECTION LVI.,"towards the truth, and renowned among men, whose son is Rāghava. He is"

4307,SECTION LVI.,"worlds. He is long-armed, of expansive eyes,—like unto a celestial—he is"
4308,SECTION LVI.,"my husband. Born in the race of the Ikshwākus, he hath the shoulders of"
4309,SECTION LVI.,a lion and is possessed of exceeding effulgence—the same that along with
4310,SECTION LVI.,"his brother, Lakshmana, shall take thy life. If thou hadst wronged me"
4311,SECTION LVI.,"forcibly in his presence, thou wouldst have lain in battle in Janasthāna"
4312,SECTION LVI.,"even as Khara."" All the mighty Rākshasas of grim visages, whom thou hast"
4313,SECTION LVI.,"extolled (before me) shall be deprived of their venom before Rāma, as"
4314,SECTION LVI.,serpents are before Suparna. The shafts decorated with gold shot by the
4315,SECTION LVI.,"bow-string of Rāghava, shall pierce their bodies, as the waves of the"
4316,SECTION LVI.,"Ganga (beat against) her banks, Although, O Rāvana, thou mayst be"
4317,SECTION LVI.,"incapable of being slain either by the gods or the Asuras, yet having"
4318,SECTION LVI.,"roused the high hostility of Rāghava, thou wilt not be able to liberate"
4319,SECTION LVI.,thy life. The strong Rāghava will compass the end of what remains of thy
4320,SECTION LVI.,"life. Like the life of a beast tied to the sacrificial stake, thy own is"
4321,SECTION LVI.,"incapable of being reclaimed, Should Rāma look at thee with eyes aglow"
4322,SECTION LVI.,"with anger, thou, O Rākshasa, wouldst be consumed even as Manmatha was"
4323,SECTION LVI.,"by Rudra. He who is able to bring down the Moon or destroy him, and to"
4324,SECTION LVI.,"drink up the ocean dry, will surely liberate Sitā from here. Thy days"
4325,SECTION LVI.,"are numbered, and auspiciousness hath bidden thee adieu. Thou art shorn"
4326,SECTION LVI.,"of strength, and thy senses have been dulled. And it is owing to thee"
4327,SECTION LVI.,that Lankā shall be subject to widowhood. That thou by force hast for

4332,SECTION LVI.,"in conflict, he will take thy prowess and strength, thy hauteur and"
4333,SECTION LVI.,"wickedness out of thy person. When urged by the Destroyer, the"

4339,SECTION LVI.,"a sacrifice beauteous with ladles, and vessels, and sanctified by the"
4340,SECTION LVI.,"twice-born ones. So I, the religiously wedded wife of that one, ever"
4341,SECTION LVI.,"intent on virtue, and (always) firm in my vows, is incapable, thou"
4342,SECTION LVI.,"vilest of Rākshasas, of being touched by thee, a sinner. How can the"
4343,SECTION LVI.,"female that hath always sported with her mate amidst lotuses, cast her"
4344,SECTION LVI.,eyes on a shag staying among rushes. Do thou either bind or destroy this
4345,SECTION LVI.,"body deprived of sensation. This body will I not protect, nor yet this"
4346,SECTION LVI.,"life, O Rāvana; and I shall not be able to bring blame on myself in this"
4347,SECTION LVI.,"world."" Having said these harsh words in wrath, Videha’s daughter,"
4348,SECTION LVI.,"Jānaki, did not there again say anything unto Rāvana. Hearing Sitā’s"
4349,SECTION LVI.,"words, harsh and calculated to make one’s down stand on end, Rāvana"
4350,SECTION LVI.,"answered her in words tending to excite one’s apprehension, ""Hear, O"
4351,SECTION LVI.,"Maithili, my words. O damsel if, O thou of sweet smiles, within this"
4352,SECTION LVI.,"time thou do not turn thyself unto me, the cooks shall cut thee off in"
4353,SECTION LVI.,"pieces to serve my morning meal."" Having herself spoken thus,"
4354,SECTION LVI.,"Rāvana,—challenger of foes— growing exceedingly wroth, addressed the"
4355,SECTION LVI.,"Rākshasis in these words, ""Ye frightful Rākshasis terrible to behold,"
4356,SECTION LVI.,"subsisting on flesh and gore, do ye at once crush her pride."" As soon as"
4357,SECTION LVI.,"he had said this, those frightfnl and terrible Rākshasis with joined"
4358,SECTION LVI.,"hands encircled Maithili. Then the grim-visaged king Rāvana, as if"
4359,SECTION LVI.,"riving the earth by his tread, proceeding a pace or two, said, ""Do ye"
4360,SECTION LVI.,"take Maithili to the wood of _Asokas_. There surrounding her, do ye"
4361,SECTION LVI.,"secretly guard her; and there (sometimes) by storming, and (at others)"
4362,SECTION LVI.,"by means of soft speech, do ye all strive to bring Mithilā’s daughter,"
4363,SECTION LVI.,"like a wild female elephant, under your sway."" Thus commanded by Rāvana,"
4364,SECTION LVI.,"those Rākshasis taking Maithili along with them, went to the _Asoka_"
4365,SECTION LVI.,"wood, abounding with trees granting every desire, and filled with"
4366,SECTION LVI.,various kinds of fruits and flowers; and frequented by fowls fraught
4367,SECTION LVI.,with juices at all seasons. And as a doe comes under the subjection of
4368,SECTION LVI.,"tigresses, Janaka’s daughter, Maithili, her frame worked up with grief,"
4369,SECTION LVI.,came under the sway of the Rākshasis. And like a female deer fast bound
4370,SECTION LVI.,"by a trap, Janaka’s timid daughter Maithili, agitated by the mighty"
4371,SECTION LVI.,"grief, did not attain respite. And greatly up-braided by the fierce eyes"
4372,SECTION LVI.,"(of the Rākshasis), Maithili did not know repose; and, afflicted with"
4373,SECTION LVI.,"grief and fear, she, remembering her beloved lord along with Lakshmana"
4374,SECTION LVI.,swooned away.

4383,SECTION LVI.,"path. On Sitā having entered Lankā, the great father addressed the"
4384,SECTION LVI.,"gratified Devendra of an hundred sacrifices, ""For bringing about the"
4385,SECTION LVI.,"weal of the three worlds, and the woe of the Rākshasas, Sitā hath been"
4386,SECTION LVI.,"taken into Lankā by the wicked-minded, Rāvana. Devoted unto her husband,"
4387,SECTION LVI.,"the exalted lady always brought up in happiness, not seeing her husband,"
4388,SECTION LVI.,"and seeing (on the other hand) environed by numbers of Rākshasis,—is"
4389,SECTION LVI.,hungering after the sight of her lord. The city of Lankā is situated on
4390,SECTION LVI.,the shores of the lord of rivers and streams. How can Rāma get a

4394,SECTION LVI.,hath arisen as to Sitā putting a period to her existence. Having thyself
4395,SECTION LVI.,"from here, do thou see the fair-faced Sitā. Having entered the city of"
4396,SECTION LVI.,"Lankā, offer excellent clarified butter."" Thus addressed by the reverend"
4397,SECTION LVI.,"chastiser of Paka, Devendra in company with sleep, approached the city"
4398,SECTION LVI.,"ruled by Rāvana. He then addressed sleep, saying, ""Go thou; and stupify"
4399,SECTION LVI.,"the Rākshasas."" Thus accosted by Maghavat, that goddess, exceedingly"
4400,SECTION LVI.,"delighted, for securing success to the work of the celestials, covered"
4401,SECTION LVI.,"the Rākshasas with stupor. In the meanwhile, that god, the thousand-eyed"
4402,SECTION LVI.,"lord of Sachi went to (Sitā) staying in the woods, and spoke unto her"
4403,SECTION LVI.,"these words, ""I am the sovereign of the celestials. Good betide thee! I"
4404,SECTION LVI.,"am here, O thou of luminous smiles! For securing success unto the work"
4405,SECTION LVI.,"of the magnanimous Rāghava, I will lend my aid unto thee. Do not, O"
4406,SECTION LVI.,"daughter of Janaka, grieve. Through my grace, he shall along with his"
4407,SECTION LVI.,"forces cross over the ocean. And, O excellent wench, I have by my"
4408,SECTION LVI.,"supernal power, stupified the Rākshasis. And, O Sitā, for this reason, I"
4409,SECTION LVI.,"along with sleep, taking these rice,—rice boiled in clarified butter,"

4413,SECTION LVI.,"addressed, Sitā, alarmed, said, ""How can I know thee for Devendra,"
4414,SECTION LVI.,"Sachi’s husband, staying here? By the side of Rāma and Lakshmana, I had"
4415,SECTION LVI.,"beheld the signs of the celestials. If, O Devendra, thou art thyself the"
4416,SECTION LVI.,"sovereign of the celestials, show those unto me."" Hearing Sitā’s words,"
4417,SECTION LVI.,the lord of Sachi did accordingly. He did not touch the earth with his
4418,SECTION LVI.,"feet, and his eyes remained winkless. He bloomed in youth, and the"
4419,SECTION LVI.,"blossoms did not fade on his attire. Thereupon knowing him for Vasava,"
4420,SECTION LVI.,"Sitā was overjoyed. And weeping, she spoke regarding Rāghava, ""By luck"
4421,SECTION LVI.,it is that I had heard of that mighty-armed one along with his brother.
4422,SECTION LVI.,"As is my father-in-law, the king, as is the master of Mithilā, so art"

4425,SECTION LVI.,"_pāyasa_ cooked with milk, which hath been offered unto me, and which"

4453,SECTION LVII.,"Mithilā’s daughter and commissioned by herself, must have come near me."
4454,SECTION LVII.,"Surely, the Rākshasas in a body are desirous of slaying Sitā. Becoming a"
4455,SECTION LVII.,"golden deer, Māricha, having allured me far, transformed himself into a"

4457,SECTION LVII.,"’Ah! Lakshmana, slain am I.’ It is doubtless, we having left (Sitā),"
4458,SECTION LVII.,whether all is well with her. I having raised the hostility of the
4459,SECTION LVII.,Rākshasas for the sake of Janasthāna; and many and dreadful are the
4460,SECTION LVII.,"omens I see (around me)."" Thus reflecting as he heard the bowlings of"
4461,SECTION LVII.,"the jackals, the self-possessed Rāma with hasty steps returned to the"
4462,SECTION LVII.,"asylum. Rāghava went back to Janasthāna, alarmed in consequence of his"
4463,SECTION LVII.,having been drawn away by the Rākshasa in the form of a deer. And birds
4464,SECTION LVII.,and beasts approached that high-souled one distressed and depressed in
4465,SECTION LVII.,spirit; and staying on his left set up frightful cries. As he was
4466,SECTION LVII.,"witnessing the exceedingly dreadful signs, Rāghava saw Lakshmana coming"
4467,SECTION LVII.,with a lacklustre (countenance); and Lakshmana came up to Rāma. And
4468,SECTION LVII.,"depressed in spirit, he was rendered still more sad by that one who,"

4470,SECTION LVII.,"(Lakshmana) had come, leaving Sitā in that solitary wood frequented by"
4471,SECTION LVII.,"Rākshasas, his brother fell to reprimanding him. And taking Lakshmana’s"

4622,SECTION LX.,"having an auspicious countenance. O _Bilya_, tell me pray, if thou hast"
4623,SECTION LX.,"seen her, wearing silken cloth, resembling cool leaves and having breast"
4624,SECTION LX.,"like unto _Bilya_ fruits. Or, O Aryunā, she was very fond of thee, tell"
4625,SECTION LX.,me if liveth that daughter of Janaka of slender frame. This _Kakuva_
4626,SECTION LX.,knoweth for certain about Maithilee having thighs like unto _Kakuva_.
4627,SECTION LX.,"Yon stands beautifully that _Banaspati_ being enveloped with creepers,"
4628,SECTION LX.,flowers and leaves and filled with the hum of _Vramaras_. Surely doth
4629,SECTION LX.,"this _Tilaka_ know about her who was fond of her. O _Asoka_, who doth"
4630,SECTION LX.,"remove sorrows, do thou make good thy name by making me, who am"
4631,SECTION LX.,"exercised with grief, see instantly my beloved (spouse). O _Tala_, if"
4632,SECTION LX.,thou hast any pity on me do thou tell me whether thou hast beheld that
4633,SECTION LX.,fair damsel having breast resembling ripe _Tala_ fruits. Do thou tell me
4634,SECTION LX.,"without fear, O Jāmbhu, if thou hast seen my dear one resembling in hue"
4635,SECTION LX.,"the river Jāmbhu. O _Karnikar_, thou appearest very beautiful with this"
4636,SECTION LX.,"blossoming flowers, tell me if thou hast seen my dear devoted wife who"
4637,SECTION LX.,"was fond of thee."" Thus the highly famous Rāma asking about Sitā,"
4638,SECTION LX.,"nearing the various trees such as mangoe, Nipa, Mahasālā, Panaça,"
4639,SECTION LX.,"Kurava, Pomegranate, Vakula, Pumnaga, Sandal and Keta began to traverse"
4640,SECTION LX.,"the forest like a maniac. Again addressed he the diverse animals—""O"
4641,SECTION LX.,"deer, knowest thou for certain about Jānaki having the eyes of a doe; is"
4642,SECTION LX.,"she engaged in play with the does? O elephant, methinks thou dost know"
4643,SECTION LX.,about the daughter of Janaka having thighs resembling thy trunk; pray
4644,SECTION LX.,"tell me if thou hast beheld her. O tiger, fearlessly do thou relate unto"
4645,SECTION LX.,"me if thou hast seen my beloved Maithilee, having a countenance"
4646,SECTION LX.,resembling Moon. O dear! O thou having eyes like unto lotuses! why dost
4647,SECTION LX.,thou fly away? Surely have I seen thee. Why dost thou not address me
4648,SECTION LX.,"hiding thyself behind the tree? Wait, wait, O thou fair damsel, thou"
4649,SECTION LX.,hast no compassion for me! Never hadst thou mock me before in this way!
4650,SECTION LX.,"Why dost thou neglect me now? O exquisitely fair damsel, truly have I"
4651,SECTION LX.,found thee out from this thy yellow silken cloth. I have seen thee
4652,SECTION LX.,"flying away. Stand if thou hast any love for me. Or, O thou having a"
4653,SECTION LX.,"sweet smile, thou art not she; truly thou hast been killed or else thou"
4654,SECTION LX.,wouldst not have neglected me at this time of dire affliction. True it
4655,SECTION LX.,is that she hath been devoured in my absence by the Rākshasas living on
4656,SECTION LX.,"flesh having torn into pieces her limbs. Truly hath her face, resembling"
4657,SECTION LX.,"the full-moon, having beautiful teeth a fine nose and white Kundalas,"
4658,SECTION LX.,become of pale countenance being brought under the possession of the
4659,SECTION LX.,Rākshasas. Her neck had the hue of sandal and was adorned with
4660,SECTION LX.,"necklace—that beautiful tender neck was eaten up by the Rākshasas, my"
4661,SECTION LX.,beloved wife wailing. Her arms were tender like leaves and adorned with
4662,SECTION LX.,"various ornaments; truly have the Rākshasas eaten them up, shaken as"
4663,SECTION LX.,"they were, by throwing them here and there. Alas! did I leave her alone"
4664,SECTION LX.,only to be devoured by the Rākshasas? And she hath been eaten up like
4665,SECTION LX.,"one weak and helpless albeit she has many friends. O Lakshmana, O thou"
4666,SECTION LX.,"of mighty-arms, hast thou seen where my dear wife is? O dear! O Sitā!"
4667,SECTION LX.,"where hast thou gone?"" Bewailing again and again in this strain Rāma"
4668,SECTION LX.,"began to range the forest. Sometimes leaping, sometimes walking in an"
4669,SECTION LX.,"uncertain direction, again and again he looked like one void of sense."
4670,SECTION LX.,And again intent on searching Sitā he furiously engaged in traversing
4671,SECTION LX.,"the rivers, mountains, fountains and the woods. He could not wait"
4672,SECTION LX.,paitently anywhere. Entering a vast forest he searched every nook and
4673,SECTION LX.,corner for Maithilee; his desire was not satisfied and he again engaged
4674,SECTION LX.,with great labour in the finding out of his dear spouse.

4680,SECTION LXI.,
4681,SECTION LXI.,Beholding the hermitage and cottage desolate and the seats strewn here
4682,SECTION LXI.,"and there, Rāma the son of Daçaratha looked around. And finding Sitā"
4683,SECTION LXI.,nowhere he raised up his beautiful arm and broke out into lamentations
4684,SECTION LXI.,"saying, ""O Lakshmana where is Sitā? Where has she gone hence? O"
4685,SECTION LXI.,"Saumitri, who hath carried away my dear one or who hath devoured her? O"
4686,SECTION LXI.,"Sitā, if wishest thou to mock me, hiding thyself behind the tree,"
4687,SECTION LXI.,enough—enough it is—console me who am exercised with grief. O pleasant
4688,SECTION LXI.,"Sitā, without thee these faithful little deer have engaged in meditation"
4689,SECTION LXI.,"being bathed in tears. Without Sitā I shall not breathe, O Lakshmana. A"
4690,SECTION LXI.,mighty grief hath overtaken me in consequence of her being carried away.
4691,SECTION LXI.,My father the monarch shall surely behold me in the next world and ask
4692,SECTION LXI.,"me ’I engaged thee in the observance of a vow; without fulfilling that,"
4693,SECTION LXI.,why hast thou come here? O shame on thee!’ For certain shall my father
4694,SECTION LXI.,"address me with these words relating to my passionate, false and base"
4695,SECTION LXI.,conduct. All my desires have now been baffled and I have lost all
4696,SECTION LXI.,"control over myself and have been exercised with grief. O fine damsel, O"
4697,SECTION LXI.,"thou of slender waist, where dost thou repair leaving me behind like"
4698,SECTION LXI.,unto fame renouncing a person of vicious nature? Without thee I shall
4699,SECTION LXI.,"renounce my own life."" Being desirous of seeing Sitā, Rāma afflicted"
4700,SECTION LXI.,"with grief began to bewail in this strain, but did not behold the"
4701,SECTION LXI.,daughter of Janaka. Being sunk in grief on Sitā’s account he became worn
4702,SECTION LXI.,"out like unto an elephant fallen in mud. Thereat for his well being,"
4703,SECTION LXI.,"Lakshmana spoke unto him saying, ""O thou of mighty intellect— do not"
4704,SECTION LXI.,grieve. Do thou put forth thy endeavours along with me. There is that
4705,SECTION LXI.,"high hill, O hero, containing many a cave. Maithili who is fond of"
4706,SECTION LXI.,"ranging the forest and ever delighteth in beholding the flowery woods,"
4707,SECTION LXI.,must have entered therein or have gone to the watering-place blooming
4708,SECTION LXI.,with flowerets and lotuses. She has gone to the river abounding in fish
4709,SECTION LXI.,and _Banjulas_ or has hidden herself somewhere in the forest to frighten
4710,SECTION LXI.,"us and to know, O best of men, how we can search her out. O thou of"
4711,SECTION LXI.,"great beauty, let us soon engage in quest of her. O Kākuthstha, if"
4712,SECTION LXI.,"thinkest thou that she is somewhere in this forest, we shall leave no"
4713,SECTION LXI.,"quarter untried. Do thou not grieve."" After Lakshmana had spoken thus"
4714,SECTION LXI.,"out of fraternal affection, Rāma, with a composed heart, set out along"
4715,SECTION LXI.,with him in quest of Sitā. And searching every nook and corner of the
4716,SECTION LXI.,"mountains, rivers, ponds, table-lands, hills and summits they found Sitā"
4717,SECTION LXI.,nowhere. And searching thus all the mountains Rāma spake unto Lakshmana
4718,SECTION LXI.,"saying ""Behold not I the auspicious Vaidehi on this mountain, O"
4719,SECTION LXI.,"Saumitri."" Ranging the entire forest of Dandaka, Lakshmana, sore"
4720,SECTION LXI.,"distressed, spake unto his brother of flaming energy, saying ""Surely"
4721,SECTION LXI.,shalt thou come by Maithili the daughter of Janaka like unto the mighty
4722,SECTION LXI.,"armed Vishnu obtaining this earth after having bound Vāli."" Being thus"
4723,SECTION LXI.,"addressed by the heroic Lakshmana, Rāghava, greatly afflicted with"
4724,SECTION LXI.,"sorrow, replied in piteous accents—""O thou of mighty intellect I have"
4725,SECTION LXI.,"searched every nook of this forest, this pool abounding in blown"
4726,SECTION LXI.,"lotuses, and this mountain containing many a cave and fountain; but"
4727,SECTION LXI.,"nowhere have I seen Vaidehi dearer than my life."" Thus bewailing Rāma,"
4728,SECTION LXI.,"racked with sorrow consequent on Sitā, being carried away, became poorly"
4729,SECTION LXI.,and afflicted with grief and swooned away for sometime. He lost his
4730,SECTION LXI.,sense and his whole frame was worked with grief. Being grfeatly anxious
4731,SECTION LXI.,and breathless he sighed hot and fast and began to lament. And sobbing
4732,SECTION LXI.,again and again the lotus-eyed Rāma bewailed with his voice choked with
4733,SECTION LXI.,"the vapour of grief, exclaiming ""Ah Sitā!"" Thereat his dear brother"
4734,SECTION LXI.,"Lakshmana, aggrieved, consoled him with joined hands. But passing by the"
4735,SECTION LXI.,words dropping from Lakshmana’s lips Rāma again and again bewailed not
4736,SECTION LXI.,beholding his dear Sitā.

4745,SECTION LXII.,"Pierced with the shafts of Manmatha, Rāghava, as if beholding Sitā"
4746,SECTION LXII.,"though he actually did not see her, uttered the following piteous"
4747,SECTION LXII.,"accents—""O my dear, thou delightest greatly in flowers. Covering thy own"
4748,SECTION LXII.,person with _Asoka_ twigs thou art increasing my grief. Thy thighs are
4749,SECTION LXII.,like unto the trunks of plantain trees and thou hast hidden thyself
4750,SECTION LXII.,"behind the plantain grove. But I percieve thee, O fair one, thou art"
4751,SECTION LXII.,"incapable of keeping thyself hidden. O auspicious one, thou hast entered"
4752,SECTION LXII.,"smiling the _Karnikar_ grove. No more with thy pastime, O dear one,"
4753,SECTION LXII.,leading to my death. Moreover it is not proper to sport in this way in a
4754,SECTION LXII.,"hermitage. I know it full well, O my dear, that thou art by nature fond"
4755,SECTION LXII.,"of pastimes. But O thou of expansive eyes, this cottage lieth desolate,"
4756,SECTION LXII.,do thou come here. Evident it is that Sitā hath either been devoured by
4757,SECTION LXII.,"the Rākshasas or carried away by them, and therefore she doth not"
4758,SECTION LXII.,"approach me, O Lakshmana, who am thus bewailing. These deer, O"
4759,SECTION LXII.,"Lakshmana, with tearful eyes have been as if declaring that Sitā hath"
4760,SECTION LXII.,"been devoured by the night-rangers. O chaste one, O thou of exquisitely"
4761,SECTION LXII.,"fine hue, O worshipful madam, whither hast thou repaired? O Sitā, truly"
4762,SECTION LXII.,hath the desire of Kaikeyi been fulfilled to-day. I came out with Sitā
4763,SECTION LXII.,and shall return home without her. How shall I enter again that inner
4764,SECTION LXII.,apartment void of Sitā? Surely shall the people blame me as being cruel
4765,SECTION LXII.,and destitute of energy. That I have no prowess hath already been
4766,SECTION LXII.,manifested in the destruction of Sitā. When the king Janaka shall come
4767,SECTION LXII.,"to me after my return home from exile, to ask me of my welfare how shall"
4768,SECTION LXII.,I meet him? And surely shall he be overwhelmed with grief on his
4769,SECTION LXII.,daughter’s account when he shall find me without Sitā. Blessed is my
4770,SECTION LXII.,father since he is in heaven now. I shall not repair to that city
4771,SECTION LXII.,protected by Bharata. Without her even the heaven itself appears to me
4772,SECTION LXII.,as desolate. Do thou therefore repair to the city of Ayodhya leaving me
4773,SECTION LXII.,in this forest. By no means shall I breathe without her. Embracing him
4774,SECTION LXII.,"warmly do thou tell Bharata, as instructed by me— ’Rāma hath given thee"
4775,SECTION LXII.,permission to administer this kingdom.’ As ordered by me do thou with
4776,SECTION LXII.,"proper respect salute all my mothers Kauçalya, Kaikeyi and Sumitrā and"

4778,SECTION LXII.,"of foes, do thou relate at length unto my mother the story of Sitā’s"
4779,SECTION LXII.,"destruction."" Rāma bewailing thus, being overwhelmed with grief on"

4791,SECTION LXIII.,"grief after causing sorrow unto his brother. Sunk in the abyss of grief,"
4792,SECTION LXIII.,"Rāma, sighing hot and weeping piteously, spoke unto Lakshmana who was"
4793,SECTION LXIII.,"equally aggrieved, words worthy of being said on that occasion. ""Me"
4794,SECTION LXIII.,"thinks there is none other on this earth like me, the perpetrator of"
4795,SECTION LXIII.,vicious crimes. My heart or soul is not riven though crushed again and
4796,SECTION LXIII.,again without respite with a multitude of doleful events. Surely did I
4797,SECTION LXIII.,"perpetrate many a vicious deed in my previous birth, the fruit of which"
4798,SECTION LXIII.,I do now suffer and in consequence whereof misfortune after misfortune
4799,SECTION LXIII.,"hath befallen me. Coming within the compass of my remembrance, the loss"
4800,SECTION LXIII.,"of my kingdom, the death of my father, the separation of my mother and"
4801,SECTION LXIII.,"other kinsmen culminates my grief. Repairing unto woods, O Lakshmana, in"
4802,SECTION LXIII.,"Sitā’s company my grief was assuaged, nay I did not suffer physical"
4803,SECTION LXIII.,affliction even. Without Sitā these sorrows have grown anew like unto
4804,SECTION LXIII.,"fire flaming again by means of fuel. Truly my wife, timid as she is,"
4805,SECTION LXIII.,hath been carried away by a Rākshasa by the etherial track. Alas I
4806,SECTION LXIII.,"doubtless it is, that one of pleasant accents, wept piteously out of"
4807,SECTION LXIII.,fear many a time and oft. For certain my dear wife’s breast round and
4808,SECTION LXIII.,"sprinkled as it was with red sandal paste, was bathed in blood (while"
4809,SECTION LXIII.,devoured by the Rākshasas)—but there is no death for me. That
4810,SECTION LXIII.,countenance the beauty of which was enhanced by a head of curly hair and
4811,SECTION LXIII.,"which used to emit forth tender, soft and clear accents, hath become"
4812,SECTION LXIII.,"pale, being taken possession of by the Rākshasas like unto the Moon"
4813,SECTION LXIII.,almost devoured by Rāhu. Surely have the Rākshasas subsisting on gore
4814,SECTION LXIII.,drunk her blood in the sky tearing oft the neck of my dear one ever
4815,SECTION LXIII.,devoted to pious observances. Surely did that one of beautifully
4816,SECTION LXIII.,expansive eyes cry aloud poorly like unto a hind when she was drawn
4817,SECTION LXIII.,hither and thither by the Rākshasas encircling her in the forest in my
4818,SECTION LXIII.,"absence. O Lakshmana, sitting at the foot of this hill with me that"
4819,SECTION LXIII.,"large-hearted, pious Sitā, of smilling countenance, used to address thee"
4820,SECTION LXIII.,"on many a topic. This is Godavari, the best of rivers, my dear wife took"
4821,SECTION LXIII.,delight in her— has she gone there?—But she never goes there alone. Or
4822,SECTION LXIII.,has Jānaki having eyes resembling lotus-petals hath gone to bring
4823,SECTION LXIII.,"lotuses? But how is that possible, she never goes without me to bring"
4824,SECTION LXIII.,lotuses. Hath she entered at her pleasure this forest filled with many
4825,SECTION LXIII.,flowery trees and diverse birds? But that is not possible too—she is
4826,SECTION LXIII.,"timid and feareth much to enter alone in this forest. O Aditya, knowest"
4827,SECTION LXIII.,thou the pious and vicious actions of men; beareth thou testimony to the
4828,SECTION LXIII.,"truth and untruth of their actions—do thou tell me, pray, who am striken"
4829,SECTION LXIII.,"with grief, whither hath my dear one repaired, or whether hath she been"
4830,SECTION LXIII.,"killed? O Air, there is nothing on earth which is not within the compass"
4831,SECTION LXIII.,"of thy vision, do thou relate unto me whether Sitā preserving the fame"
4832,SECTION LXIII.,"of my ancestry, hath been killed or carried away or if she waiteth on"
4833,SECTION LXIII.,"the way."" After Rāma had bewailed thus being beside himself with grief,"
4834,SECTION LXIII.,"Saumitri, ever treading the right path and not of poorly mind spoke"
4835,SECTION LXIII.,"words worthy of being said on that occasion.—""Do thou take heart"

4837,SECTION LXIII.,high energy are never exhausted on the earth even in the face of arduous

4852,SECTION LXIV.,Godaveri. Reconnoitering full well the river containing many a
4853,SECTION LXIV.,"watering-place Lakshmana spake unto Rāma saying, ""Searched have I all"

4855,SECTION LXIV.,she did not hear. I cannot trace whither hath Vaidehi of slender waist
4856,SECTION LXIV.,"repaired ever assuaging our mental affliction."" Hearing Lakshmana’ s"

4864,SECTION LXIV.,concerning her and accosted by Rāma in piteous accents. Being thus
4865,SECTION LXIV.,"disappointed by the river in beholding Sitā, Rāma racked with her"
4866,SECTION LXIV.,"separation spake unto Lakshmana saying ""O thou of auspicious looks, this"
4867,SECTION LXIV.,"river Godavari doth give no reply. But O Lakshmana, returning without"
4868,SECTION LXIV.,her what shall I say unto Janaka and Vaidehi’s mother? Where hath that
4869,SECTION LXIV.,Vaidehi gone who used to assuage my grief who had been deprived of
4870,SECTION LXIV.,kingdom and living in this forest on wild fruits and vegetables? Nights
4871,SECTION LXIV.,"shall appear too long unto me, keeping late hours being deprived of my"
4872,SECTION LXIV.,kinsmen and relatives and not beholding Vaidehi. I can range this
4873,SECTION LXIV.,"Mandākini, this Janasthāna and this Pasrabana hill if I can find Sitā"
4874,SECTION LXIV.,"there. Behold, O hero, the high deer have been casting their looks again"
4875,SECTION LXIV.,"and again at men; methinks from their gestures, they intend speaking"
4876,SECTION LXIV.,"something uoto me."" Beholding them, Rāghava, the best of men, looked at"
4877,SECTION LXIV.,"them and said in accents choked with vapour—""Where is Sitā?"" Being thus"
4878,SECTION LXIV.,addressed by that Lord of men the deer rose up all on a sudden and
4879,SECTION LXIV.,looked up to the sky facing the south and proceeded to the direction by
4880,SECTION LXIV.,which Maithili had been carried away. And moving by that way these deer
4881,SECTION LXIV.,eyed the Lord of men and again and again fixed their looks upon that way

4883,SECTION LXIV.,He marked with attention their movements and cries and spake unto his
4884,SECTION LXIV.,"elder brother like one aggrieved saying—""Being accosted by thee"
4885,SECTION LXIV.,with—’Where is Sitā?’ these deer have stood up all on a sudden and have
4886,SECTION LXIV.,been pointing to the south and earth— let us therefore proceed in this

4890,SECTION LXIV.,"and casting his look upon the earth. While proceeding thus, conversing"
4891,SECTION LXIV.,with each other the two brothers beheld some flowers scattered on the
4892,SECTION LXIV.,high-way.
4893,SECTION LXIV.,
4894,SECTION LXIV.,"Beholding a collection of flowers scattered on earth, Rāma, exceedingly"
4895,SECTION LXIV.,"sorry, spake unto Lakshmana in piteous accents saying ""O Lakshmana, 1"
4896,SECTION LXIV.,have come to know that these are the flowers of the forest I gave
4897,SECTION LXIV.,"Vaidehi; with these she decorated her hair. Me thinks the sun, the air"
4898,SECTION LXIV.,"and the famed earth have preserved them for my well-being."" Having"
4899,SECTION LXIV.,"spoken these words unto Lakshmana, the best of men, the virtuous-souled"

4903,SECTION LXIV.,"with my separation?"" Exceedingly wroth he accosted the mountain like"
4904,SECTION LXIV.,"unto a lion addresing a little deer, saying ""Show me my graceful Sitā"
4905,SECTION LXIV.,"hued like gold before I crush down thy summits."" Being thus addressed by"
4906,SECTION LXIV.,Rāma on Maithili’s account the mountain did not show him Sitā. Again
4907,SECTION LXIV.,"addressed him Rāma—""Thou shalt by the fire of my arrows, be reduced to"
4908,SECTION LXIV.,ashes—thy twigs and leaves shall be totally destroyed and no one shall
4909,SECTION LXIV.,"resort to thee. O Lakshmana, I shall dry up this river Godavari if it"
4910,SECTION LXIV.,"telleth me not about Sitā having a moon-like countenance."" Rāma,"
4911,SECTION LXIV.,"exceedingly wroth, cast his looks around as if desiring to burn"
4912,SECTION LXIV.,everything with his eyes and beheld footprints of the Rākshasas on the
4913,SECTION LXIV.,"earth as well as those of Sitā moving wildly hither and thither,"
4914,SECTION LXIV.,"terrified and desirous to see Rāma, while pursued by the Rākshasas."
4915,SECTION LXIV.,"Beholding these footmarks, the snapped bow, the quiver and the chariot"
4916,SECTION LXIV.,"broken into many pieces, Rāma, terrified spake unto his dear brother."
4917,SECTION LXIV.,"""Behold O, Lakshmana, the remnants of Vaidehi’s golden ornaments, strewn"
4918,SECTION LXIV.,"hither and thither, and diverse garlands. Behold O Saumitri, the earth"
4919,SECTION LXIV.,"covered with drops of blood resembling golden drops. Methinks, O"
4920,SECTION LXIV.,"Lakshmana, Vaidehi hath been devoured by the Rākshasas assuming shapes"
4921,SECTION LXIV.,"at will, having sundered her in pieces. O Saumitri, there took place a"

4936,SECTION LXIV.,who hath been killed with reins and lash in hands? These foot-marks must
4937,SECTION LXIV.,"be some Rākshasa’s. I made these Rākshasas my fatal enemies, assuming"
4938,SECTION LXIV.,shapes at will and of crooked hearts. Poor Sitā must have been either
4939,SECTION LXIV.,"dead, carried away by them or devoured. Virtue did not save her from"

4943,SECTION LXIV.,well-being? For this it is that people through ignorance disregard the

4954,SECTION LXIV.,the welkin be filled up with my arrows. Motionless shall I make all the

4956,SECTION LXIV.,planets and overshadow the Moon. Stopping the course of the wind and
4957,SECTION LXIV.,destroying the rays of the Sun and fire I shall envelope the earth with

4963,SECTION LXIV.,"meet with my prowess, if they do not give back my Sitā, ever advancing"
4964,SECTION LXIV.,"my wellfare. None shall be able to range the welkin. Behold Lakshmana,"

4966,SECTION LXIV.,shall be disturbed and dislodged and the animals and birds shall be
4967,SECTION LXIV.,confused and destroyed. Stretching the bow to my ears I shall make the
4968,SECTION LXIV.,"world, for Sitā’s sake, void of Pisachas and Rākshasas with my arrows"
4969,SECTION LXIV.,incapable of being withstood by created beings. To-day shall the

4971,SECTION LXIV.,"through my ire. Three worlds destroyed on account of my wrath,"
4972,SECTION LXIV.,"celestials, Dānavas, Pisachas or Rākshasas,—none shall be saved. The"

5013,SECTION LXV.,wheels. Surely here took place a conflict. O thou the foremost of those
5014,SECTION LXV.,"skilled in speech, it appeareth from these signs that this skrimish did"

5243,SECTION LXIX.,"Having offered him the gift of water, those two descendants of Raghu"
5244,SECTION LXIX.,wended their way in that forest in quest of Sitā and proceeded towards
5245,SECTION LXIX.,"the south-west.⁶⁶ Then turning to the south, with bow and arrows in"
5246,SECTION LXIX.,"hand, they reached a track not wended by the people. It was a ghastly,"
5247,SECTION LXIX.,"impenetrable forest, covered on all sides with groves, trees and"
5248,SECTION LXIX.,"creepers. Proceeding by the southerly direction, those two mighty ones,"
5249,SECTION LXIX.,"passed hastily by that terrible, dreary forest. Thereupon, the highly"
5250,SECTION LXIX.,"effulgent descendants of Raghu entered the dense forest of _Krauncha_,"
5251,SECTION LXIX.,situated at a distance of six miles from _Janasthāna_. It was a dense
5252,SECTION LXIX.,"forest like unto a collection of clouds, as if smiling on all sides"
5253,SECTION LXIX.,blooming with charming flowers of diverse hues and frequented by various
5254,SECTION LXIX.,"animals and birds. Waiting for sometime here and there they, exercised"
5255,SECTION LXIX.,"with Sitā’s ravishment, explored the entire forest in quest of Vaidehi."
5256,SECTION LXIX.,Proceeding three Krosas towards the East and passing by the forest of
5257,SECTION LXIX.,Krauncha the two brothers descried on their way the asylum of Matanga.
5258,SECTION LXIX.,Having seen that dreary forest frequented by various animals and birds
5259,SECTION LXIX.,"and covered with diverse trees and dense groves, the two sons of"
5260,SECTION LXIX.,"Daçaratha beheld a cave in the mountain, deep as the region under the"
5261,SECTION LXIX.,earth and ever enveloped with darkness. Arriving there they espied hard
5262,SECTION LXIX.,"by a grim visaged Rākshasi, having a formidable figure, ever causing"
5263,SECTION LXIX.,"fright unto persons of feeble courage, loathesome, terrible-looking,"
5264,SECTION LXIX.,"having a huge belly, sharpened teeth, a high person and rough skin,"
5265,SECTION LXIX.,devouring voracious animals and looking fearful with dishevelled hair.
5266,SECTION LXIX.,"Beholding there the two brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana, she neared the"
5267,SECTION LXIX.,"heroes and saying, ’come, we shall sport’ assailed Lakshmana who had"
5268,SECTION LXIX.,been going before his brother. And embracing him she spake unto Saumitri
5269,SECTION LXIX.,"the following words—""My name is Ayomukhee; it is a great gain to thee"
5270,SECTION LXIX.,"that thou hast become my beloved one, O my lord. Do thou sport with me,"
5271,SECTION LXIX.,"for ever, O hero, in these mountainous strongholds and on the banks of"
5272,SECTION LXIX.,"the rivers."" Thereat, exercised with ire, Lakshmana, the subduer of"
5273,SECTION LXIX.,"foes, uplifting his dagger, chopped off her nose, ears and breast."
5274,SECTION LXIX.,"Having her nose and ears cut off, that terrible-looking Rākshasi,"
5275,SECTION LXIX.,"emitting fearful cries, fled away whence she had come. On her departure,"
5276,SECTION LXIX.,"proceeding quickly, the two brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana, the conquerors"
5277,SECTION LXIX.,"of foes, reached a dense forest. Thereupon the highly effulgent and"
5278,SECTION LXIX.,"truthful Lakshmana, possessing a pure character, spake, with folded"
5279,SECTION LXIX.,"hands, unto his brother of flaming energy—""My left arm is throbbing, my"
5280,SECTION LXIX.,mind is filled with anxiety and I perceive before me many a bad omen. Do
5281,SECTION LXIX.,"thou put on thy habiliments, O worshipful one, and act by what I say for"
5282,SECTION LXIX.,thy well-being. Methinks from these bad omens some calamity shall soon
5283,SECTION LXIX.,"befall us. O Rāma, this terrible bird _Banchulaka_ is emitting fearful"
5284,SECTION LXIX.,"cries as if announcing our victory in the conflict."" Thereupon while"
5285,SECTION LXIX.,they began to explore the entire forest with their prowess there arose a
5286,SECTION LXIX.,terrible sound as if breaking down the wood. The forest was enveloped on
5287,SECTION LXIX.,all sides with a mighty wind and everywhere was audible a roar filling
5288,SECTION LXIX.,"the wood-land. With a view to ascertain whence the sound proceeded,"
5289,SECTION LXIX.,"Rāma, with a dagger in hand, along with his younger brother, espied a"
5290,SECTION LXIX.,"Rākshasha of huge proportions, having big thighs. The two brothers"
5291,SECTION LXIX.,"beheld that Rākshasa stationed before them, having a huge body, devoid"
5292,SECTION LXIX.,of head and neck and therefore a headless demon and having its mouth on
5293,SECTION LXIX.,its belly. Its body resembled a huge mountain and was covered with
5294,SECTION LXIX.,sharpened down; its look was terrible like unto sable cloud and its roar
5295,SECTION LXIX.,"resembled the muttering where of. Its one terrible, expansive eye,"
5296,SECTION LXIX.,"seeing all, was on the forehead placed on its breast and shone forth"
5297,SECTION LXIX.,like unto the flaming fire and it had huge yellow eye-lashes. Its mouth
5298,SECTION LXIX.,was greatly widened and covered with rows of huge teeth and it was again
5299,SECTION LXIX.,and again licking that terrible mouth. And stretching forth its two huge
5300,SECTION LXIX.,"arms extending over a _yojana_ it was devouring bears, lions and deer."
5301,SECTION LXIX.,"It was catching and throwing with its huge hands many an animal, bird"
5302,SECTION LXIX.,and bear. Hindering the way-fare it was awaiting those two brothers. And
5303,SECTION LXIX.,"proceeding a _Krosa_, they espied that fearful, grim-visaged, headless"
5304,SECTION LXIX.,"demon, hindering all creatures with its arms, terrible-looking and"
5305,SECTION LXIX.,"appearing like a _kavanda_ from its very situation. Thereupon that one,"
5306,SECTION LXIX.,"of huge arms, stretching them forth, got hold of those two descendants"
5307,SECTION LXIX.,of Raghu crushing them with its strength. Those two highly powerful
5308,SECTION LXIX.,"brothers, of mighty arms, with daggers and bows in their hands, were"
5309,SECTION LXIX.,assailed and got hold of by that Rākshasha. Rāma was heroic and patient
5310,SECTION LXIX.,by nature and consequently was not much afflicted; but Lakshmana was a
5311,SECTION LXIX.,mere boy and impatient by nature and was consequently greatly afflicted.
5312,SECTION LXIX.,"Being greatly distressed, the younger brother of Rāghava spake unto him,"
5313,SECTION LXIX.,"saying ""Do thou behold me, O hero, brought under the hold of this"
5314,SECTION LXIX.,"Rākshasha, and re-nouncing me only, O Rāghava, do thou get thyself off."
5315,SECTION LXIX.,"And offering me as sacrifice, do thou escape at thy ease. Methinks for"
5316,SECTION LXIX.,"certain, O Kākuthstha, thou shalt soon come by Vaidehi and regain thy"
5317,SECTION LXIX.,"anscestral kingdom. But remember me always, O Rāma, when thou shalt find"
5318,SECTION LXIX.,"thyself placed on the throne."" Being thus addressed by Lakshmana, Rāma"
5319,SECTION LXIX.,"spake unto Saumitri—""Fear not in vain, O hero; persons of thy prowess"
5320,SECTION LXIX.,"are never afflicted (with fear)."" Meanwhile the wicked headless, demon,"
5321,SECTION LXIX.,"of huge arms, the foremost of Dānaves, addressed the two brothers Rāma"
5322,SECTION LXIX.,"and Lakshmana —""Who are ye two youthful figures having the neck of a"
5323,SECTION LXIX.,bull and with mighty daggers and bows in your hands? Arriving in this
5324,SECTION LXIX.,fearful place ye have by chance come within the compass of my vision.
5325,SECTION LXIX.,"Tell me now what have ye to do here, and what for have ye come? I have"
5326,SECTION LXIX.,"been waiting here being hungry, and ye have come here having daggers and"
5327,SECTION LXIX.,bows with arrows in your hands like unto two oxen having sharpened
5328,SECTION LXIX.,"horns. Nearing me quickly, it will be hard for ye to draw your vital"
5329,SECTION LXIX.,"breath."" Hearing those words of the vicious-souled _Kavandha_, Rāma"
5330,SECTION LXIX.,"having his countenance dried up, bespake Lakshmana—""O thou, having truth"
5331,SECTION LXIX.,"for thy prowess, again and again, greater and worse calamities have been"
5332,SECTION LXIX.,threatening us. We have already met with a dire disaster leading to our
5333,SECTION LXIX.,"death, consequent on my separation from my dear one. Mighty is the"
5334,SECTION LXIX.,"course of Destiny in all creatures, O Lakshmana. Do thou O best of men,"
5335,SECTION LXIX.,behold even thyself and me stricken with calamity. But O Lakshmana it is
5336,SECTION LXIX.,not very difficult for destiny to afflict all creatures. Under the
5337,SECTION LXIX.,"influence of destiny even the mighty heroes, well habited in armours are"
5338,SECTION LXIX.,"distressed like unto a bridge of sands."" Addressing these words unto"
5339,SECTION LXIX.,"Saumitri, the resolute, powerful and highly famous son of Daçaratha,"
5340,SECTION LXIX.,"having truth for his prowess, composed himself by dint of his own"
5341,SECTION LXIX.,understanding.

5355,SECTION LXX.,"have been chosen by Destiny as my food."" Hearing those words Lakshmana,"
5356,SECTION LXX.,"sore distressed and determined to display his valour, addressed Rāma"
5357,SECTION LXX.,"with words worthy of being said on that occasion. ""This vile Rākshasa"
5358,SECTION LXX.,shall seize both of us; let us sunder soon its two huge arms with our
5359,SECTION LXX.,"daggers. This grim-visaged Rākshasa, of huge proportions, gifted only"
5360,SECTION LXX.,"with the strength of arms, defeating all other persons, hath addressed"
5361,SECTION LXX.,itself at last to destroy us. It is odious for the Kshatryas to make
5362,SECTION LXX.,away with those who cannot defend themselves like unto animals brought
5363,SECTION LXX.,"for sacrifice.""⁶⁷ Hearing their conversation, the Rākshasa, inflamed"
5364,SECTION LXX.,"with rage, widening its terrible mouth, prepared to devour them up.⁶⁸"
5365,SECTION LXX.,"Thereat Rāma and Lakshmana, cognizant of time and place, pleased,⁶⁹"
5366,SECTION LXX.,"sundered its arms off its shoulders with their daggers. Rāma, stationed"
5367,SECTION LXX.,on the right side⁷⁰ cut off in no time its right arm with his dagger and
5368,SECTION LXX.,"the heroic Lakshmana, the left one. Having got its arms dissevered, the"
5369,SECTION LXX.,"terrible-voiced, _Kavandha_, of huge arms,roaring like unto the"
5370,SECTION LXX.,"muttering of clouds and resounding the heaven, earth and all the"
5371,SECTION LXX.,"quarters, fell flat on the ground. Beholding both its arms cut off, the"
5372,SECTION LXX.,"demon, with its person bathed in blood, asked them poorly—"" Who are ye?"""
5373,SECTION LXX.,"Being thus accosted by _Kavandha_, the mighty Lakshmana, gifted with"
5374,SECTION LXX.,"auspicious marks, spake unto it, about Kākuthstha. ""He is a descendant"
5375,SECTION LXX.,"of the Ikshwākus known on earth by the name of Rāma, and know me as his"
5376,SECTION LXX.,"younger brother, by name—Lakshmana. Being thwarted by mother (Kaikeyi)"
5377,SECTION LXX.,"in his accession of kingdom, he, renouncing all, hath fled as an exile"
5378,SECTION LXX.,"unto woods, and hath, along with me and his spouse, been ranging this"
5379,SECTION LXX.,"forest. While living in the dense forest the wife of Rāma, effulgent"
5380,SECTION LXX.,like unto the celestials hath been ravished by a Rākshasa. Searching
5381,SECTION LXX.,"her, have we come here. Who art thou? And what for art thou ranging this"
5382,SECTION LXX.,"forest like unto a headless demon, having thy thighs broken and thy"
5383,SECTION LXX.,"flaming face placed on thy breast?"" Being thus addressed by Lakshmana"
5384,SECTION LXX.,"with these goodly words, _Kavandha_, pleased, recollecting the words of"
5385,SECTION LXX.,"Indra, bespake him,—""O two best of men, ye are welcome! By my good luck"
5386,SECTION LXX.,it is that I do behold you. By my good fortune ye have dissevered my
5387,SECTION LXX.,"shoulders to-day. Do ye hear. I shall relate truly unto you how have I,"
5388,SECTION LXX.,"by my haughtiness, come by this unsightly shape."""
5389,SECTION LXX.,
5390,SECTION LXX.,⁶⁷ The purport is:—Lakshmana wanted to chop off the arms of
5391,SECTION LXX.,_Kavandha_ and not to put an end to its life as it was not capable
5392,SECTION LXX.,"of fighting, being a headless demon. And it is not proper for the"

5408,SECTION LXXI.,"O mighty armed Rāma of great prowess, formerly my beauty, beyond"
5409,SECTION LXXI.,"conception, was known all over the three worlds, like unto the beauty of"
5410,SECTION LXXI.,"the Sun, the Moon and Indra. I used to frighten everywhere the ascetics"
5411,SECTION LXXI.,living in the forest by turning this my beauty into a terrific form.
5412,SECTION LXXI.,Once on a time assuming this terrible shape I assailed and enraged the
5413,SECTION LXXI.,great ascetic _Sthulashira_ collecting diverse wild fruits. Thereupon he
5414,SECTION LXXI.,"imprecated curses upon me, saying ""Do thou retain this ghastly shape"
5415,SECTION LXXI.,"hated of all mankind."" Upon my praying unto that angry ascetic for my"
5416,SECTION LXXI.,"relief from that curse, he said—""Thou shalt regain thy stalwart and"
5417,SECTION LXXI.,beautiful shape when thou shalt be burnt by Rāma in a dense forest
5418,SECTION LXXI.,"having got thy arms dissevered by him. O Lakshmana, know me to be the"
5419,SECTION LXXI.,beautiful son of Danu. Through Indra’s curse in the battle field I have
5420,SECTION LXXI.,been metamorphosed into my present shape. After I had pleased him with
5421,SECTION LXXI.,"hard austerites, the Grand-Father of the celestials conferred on me a"
5422,SECTION LXXI.,long life. And therefore I was inflamed with pride and assailed Indra in
5423,SECTION LXXI.,"a conflict, thinking within me, ’I have gained a long life—what can"
5424,SECTION LXXI.,"Indra do me?’ Thereupon by his thunderbolt, having hundred edges, hurled"
5425,SECTION LXXI.,"off his hands, my thighs were shattered and my head thrusted into my"
5426,SECTION LXXI.,"body. Myself praying for the close of my life, he did not despatch me to"
5427,SECTION LXXI.,"the abode of Yama. He only said ""May the words of the Grand Sire prove"
5428,SECTION LXXI.,"true."" Whereto I replied ’How shall I live long without any food, being"
5429,SECTION LXXI.,"smitten by thee having a thunderbot in thy hand, and having my head,"
5430,SECTION LXXI.,thighs and mouth crushed down?’ Thereat Indra made my hands extending
5431,SECTION LXXI.,"over a _Yajana_ and placed my mouth, having sharpened teeth, on my"
5432,SECTION LXXI.,"belly. Thenceforth, stretching out my long arms I used to devour all"
5433,SECTION LXXI.,"lions, tigers, wolves and deer ranging the forest. Indra said to me,"
5434,SECTION LXXI.,"Thou shalt attain to heaven when Rāma, along with Lakshmana, shall cut"
5435,SECTION LXXI.,"off thy arms in a battle.’ Acting under the conviction that Rāma,"
5436,SECTION LXXI.,"resolved to destroy my person, shall surely come within the compass of"
5437,SECTION LXXI.,"my arms, I do always assail with relish, O worshipful one, O thou best"
5438,SECTION LXXI.,"of kings, every animal I meet with in this forest. Thou art that Rāma."
5439,SECTION LXXI.,"May good betide thee, O Rāghava. Verily did the great ascetic speak unto"
5440,SECTION LXXI.,me that none should be able to assail me but Rāma. Being cremated by
5441,SECTION LXXI.,"you, I shall counsel you best and tell you with whom you should contract"
5442,SECTION LXXI.,"friendship."" Being thus addressed by Danu, the virtuous-souled Rāghava"
5443,SECTION LXXI.,"spake before listening Lakshmana, ""My renowned spouse Sitā was easily"
5444,SECTION LXXI.,ravished by Rāvana after I had gone out of Janasthāna along with my
5445,SECTION LXXI.,brother. I know that Rākshasa’s name only—but do not know his
5446,SECTION LXXI.,"whereabouts, his figure and his prowess. It behoveth thee to show proper"
5447,SECTION LXXI.,"compassion for us, who have been stricken with grief, who are helpless,"
5448,SECTION LXXI.,have been ranging this forest in this way and are ever engaged in the
5449,SECTION LXXI.,"well-being of others⁷¹ O, hero, we shall burn thee after collecting all"

5452,SECTION LXXI.,Sitā? And where? If dost thou know it truly do thou perform us this good
5453,SECTION LXXI.,"service."" Thereat the Rākshasa, skilled in speech, spake unto Rāghava,"
5454,SECTION LXXI.,"addressing him thus—""I am not gifted with divine fore-sight and"
5455,SECTION LXXI.,therefore do not know where Maithilee is. I shall let you know of him
5456,SECTION LXXI.,"who shall be able to tell you all about her, after I resume my original"
5457,SECTION LXXI.,"shape, being burnt (by thee). I shall furthermore tell thee, O Rāma, who"
5458,SECTION LXXI.,knows that Rākshasa. Without being burnt I am incapable of being
5459,SECTION LXXI.,cognizant of that highly powerful Rākshasa who hath carried away thy
5460,SECTION LXXI.,"Sitā. By the influence of curse, I have lost my fore-sight and by my own"
5461,SECTION LXXI.,improper actions I have been transformed into this ugly figure. Do thou
5462,SECTION LXXI.,cremate me according to the prescribed rites after throwing me into the
5463,SECTION LXXI.,"ditch before the sun, with his worn out carriers descends into the"
5464,SECTION LXXI.,"western horizon. Being burnt by thee in the ditch, with due ceremonials,"
5465,SECTION LXXI.,"O descendant of Raghu, I shall mention, unto thee, one who knows that"
5466,SECTION LXXI.,"Rākshasa. O Rāghava, O fleet-footed hero, do thou contract friendship"
5467,SECTION LXXI.,with him gifted with good qualities and he shall assist thee. There is
5468,SECTION LXXI.,"nothing unknown to him, O Rāghava in the three worlds. Formerly for some"
5469,SECTION LXXI.,"reasons he had travelled all over them."""
5470,SECTION LXXI.,
5471,SECTION LXXI.,⁷¹ This Sloka may be rendered in another way:—Do thou continue
5472,SECTION LXXI.,"benifitting us by showing proper compassion for us, who are"

5482,SECTION LXXII.,"After _Kavandha_ had spoken thus, the two best of men, Rāma and"
5483,SECTION LXXII.,Lakshmana took him to a mountain-cave and placed on fire. Lakshmana
5484,SECTION LXXII.,"kindled the funeral pile, which was ablaze on all sides. Thereupon the"
5485,SECTION LXXII.,fire began to burn down slowly the huge and corpulent body of _Kavandha_
5486,SECTION LXXII.,like unto a lump of clarified butter. Afterwards the highly powerful
5487,SECTION LXXII.,"demon, shaking the funeral pile, rose up quickly like a smokeless flame"
5488,SECTION LXXII.,"of fire, wearing a clean cloth and a celestial garland. And the graceful"
5489,SECTION LXXII.,"demon, wearing an unsullied cloth and having all its limbs crested with"
5490,SECTION LXXII.,"diverse ornaments, rose from the pile high up in the welkin with a"
5491,SECTION LXXII.,"delighted heart. Thereupon mounting on a famed car, brilliant and drawn"
5492,SECTION LXXII.,by swans⁷² and lighting up all the quarters with the effulgence of his
5493,SECTION LXXII.,"person, that highly powerful one, stationing himself in the heaven,"
5494,SECTION LXXII.,"addressed Rāma, saying:—""Do thou hear truly, O Rāghava, of the means by"
5495,SECTION LXXII.,"which thou shalt come by Sitā. There are six expedients,⁷³ O Rāma, by"
5496,SECTION LXXII.,"virtue of which kings acquire all objects. He, in whom misfortune hath"
5497,SECTION LXXII.,"culminated, should seek the company of one such.⁷⁴ Thou hast, O Rāma"
5498,SECTION LXXII.,"along with Lakshmana, met with the culmination of misfortune and for"
5499,SECTION LXXII.,which thou hast been assailed with such a disaster as the ravishment of
5500,SECTION LXXII.,"thy spouse. O thou best of my friends, it behoveth thee, therefore to"
5501,SECTION LXXII.,make friends with such a person. Or else I do not find any means for thy
5502,SECTION LXXII.,"success. Do thou hear, O Rāma, what I relate. There liveth with four"
5503,SECTION LXXII.,"monkeys a heroic, self-controlled monkey by name Sugriva, on that best"
5504,SECTION LXXII.,"of mountains _Rishyamuka_, situated on the banks of the lake Pampā,"
5505,SECTION LXXII.,"being driven by his enraged brother Vāli, the son of Indra. That mighty,"
5506,SECTION LXXII.,"powerful, effulgent lord of monkeys, of immeasurable prowess and"
5507,SECTION LXXII.,"truthful vows, humble, patient, intelligent, great, expert, bold,"
5508,SECTION LXXII.,"graceful and puissant, hath been banished by his brother, O hero, for"
5509,SECTION LXXII.,kingdom. Surely he shall befriend and assist thee in thy search for
5510,SECTION LXXII.,"Sitā. Do thou not plunge thy soul in grief. O thou best of Ikshwākus,"
5511,SECTION LXXII.,"none can withstand destiny on this earth, truly unavoidable is it"
5512,SECTION LXXII.,"course. Do thou proceed soon, O hero, to Sugrivā of mighty prowess, and"
5513,SECTION LXXII.,"repairing hence even to-day do thou contract friendship with him, taking"
5514,SECTION LXXII.,vow in the presence of flaming fire⁷⁵ that ye shall not envy each other.
5515,SECTION LXXII.,"Despise not that kingly monkey Sugrivā, because he is grateful, capable"
5516,SECTION LXXII.,"of assuming shapes at will, seeking protection and powerful. Ye too are"
5517,SECTION LXXII.,"able to accomplish his wished-for object. Benefitted by thee or not, he"
5518,SECTION LXXII.,shall engage in thy service. He was begotten of the Sun unto the wife of
5519,SECTION LXXII.,_Rikhyraja_. He hath been roaming the bank of Pāmpa being in constant

5521,SECTION LXXII.,that monkey ranging the wood and inhabiting the Rishyamuka mountain
5522,SECTION LXXII.,"after placing thy weapon in the very presence of fire as a witness,"
5523,SECTION LXXII.,because that best of monkeys knoweth minutely all the abodes of
5524,SECTION LXXII.,"Rākshasas, living on human flesh. There is no place under the sun of"
5525,SECTION LXXII.,"many rays, O Rāghava, O slayer of foes, unknown to him. Exploring, with"
5526,SECTION LXXII.,"all his monkeys, the rivers, huge mountains, strongholds and caves, he"

5558,SECTION LXXIII.,Having pointed out unto Rāma the expedient for finding out Sitā the wise
5559,SECTION LXXIII.,"_Kavandha_ began with the following significant words:—""This is the way,"
5560,SECTION LXXIII.,"O Rāma, leading to the mount Rishyamuka, where stand, beautifying the"
5561,SECTION LXXIII.,"West, the _Jambu_,⁷⁶ _Priāla_,⁷⁷ _Panaca_,⁷⁸ _Nagrodha_,⁷⁹ _Plaksha_,⁸⁰"

5564,SECTION LXXIII.,"_Agnimukhya_,⁹¹ _Asoka_, _Raktachandan_,⁹² _Pāribhadraka_,⁹³ and many"
5565,SECTION LXXIII.,"other trees. Ascending those trees or lowering them by force on earth,"
5566,SECTION LXXIII.,do thou proceed living on those fruits like unto ambrosia. Passing by
5567,SECTION LXXIII.,"this forest, O Kākuthstha, thou shalt reach another abounding in trees"
5568,SECTION LXXIII.,blooming with flowers like unto the garden of celestials and _Uttarkuru_
5569,SECTION LXXIII.,where in all the months of the year the trees produce fruits and honey
5570,SECTION LXXIII.,and where all the seasons dwell as in the forest of _Chaitkraratha_.⁹⁴
5571,SECTION LXXIII.,There stand beautifully many a tree lowered down with the burden of
5572,SECTION LXXIII.,"fruits, containing towering branches, dense as a collection of clouds or"
5573,SECTION LXXIII.,"a mountain. Ascending those trees and lowering them, Lakshmana shall"
5574,SECTION LXXIII.,"offer thee, fruits like unto ambrosia. O heroes, ranging from forest to"
5575,SECTION LXXIII.,"forest, from high mountains to hillocks, ye shall get at the lake Pampā,"
5576,SECTION LXXIII.,void of gravels and acquatic plants and hence there is no danger of
5577,SECTION LXXIII.,"falling down to the people, having level watering-places, covered with"
5578,SECTION LXXIII.,sands and blooming with red and white lotuses. There emit forth musical
5579,SECTION LXXIII.,"notes, swans, frogs, cranes and ospreys sporting in the lake Pampā. They"
5580,SECTION LXXIII.,"are not filled with terror in view of human beings, inexperienced as"
5581,SECTION LXXIII.,"they are in the matter of destruction. O Rāghava, do ye fare on those"
5582,SECTION LXXIII.,plump birds like unto a lump of clarified butter and diverse fishes such
5583,SECTION LXXIII.,"as _Rohita_,⁹⁵ _Chakratunda_,⁹⁶ and _Nala_.⁹⁷ O Rāma, the devoted"
5584,SECTION LXXIII.,"Lakshmana, shall offer unto thee, various other best fishes, devoid of"
5585,SECTION LXXIII.,"scale and fins, plump, filled with bones, having destroyed them with"
5586,SECTION LXXIII.,"shafts and roasted them in fire. And after thou hadst feasted on them,"
5587,SECTION LXXIII.,"Lakshmana shall bring thee water for drinking on a lotus leaf, smelling"
5588,SECTION LXXIII.,"like a lotus, coming in contact with flowers, delicious, pleasantly"
5589,SECTION LXXIII.,"cold, wholesome, void of impurities, transparent like silver and"
5590,SECTION LXXIII.,crystal. And while roaming in the evening he shall point out unto thee
5591,SECTION LXXIII.,fat monkeys ranging in the wood and lying in the hollows of mountains.
5592,SECTION LXXIII.,"And thou too, O best of men, shalt behold those fat monkeys, who had"
5593,SECTION LXXIII.,"drunk water, roaring like unto oxen appearing on the banks of a river to"
5594,SECTION LXXIII.,"drink water. And rambling in the evening, thou shalt assuage thy grief"
5595,SECTION LXXIII.,"beholding the pleasant water of Pampā and blossoming trees. There, O"
5596,SECTION LXXIII.,"Rāghava, the _Tilakas_ and _Naktamalakas_, crested with flowers and full"
5597,SECTION LXXIII.,blown white and red lotuses shall mitigate thy sorrows. There liveth no
5598,SECTION LXXIII.,person who wears garlands of those flowers. Garlands strung with those
5599,SECTION LXXIII.,"flowers never wither away, O Rāghava, because the disciples of the great"
5600,SECTION LXXIII.,ascetic Matanga lived there with concentrated hearts. Drops of
5601,SECTION LXXIII.,"perspiration, falling on the earth from the persons of those ascetics"
5602,SECTION LXXIII.,worn out with the burden of the wild fruits collected by them for their
5603,SECTION LXXIII.,"spiritual guide, have been transformed by virtue of their asceticism"
5604,SECTION LXXIII.,"unto these garlands. These garlands do never wither, O Rāghava, because"
5605,SECTION LXXIII.,of their origination from those drops of perspiration. Even at the
5606,SECTION LXXIII.,"present day, O Kākuthstha, there liveth an immortal mendicant woman, by"
5607,SECTION LXXIII.,"name _Savari_, who had waited in attendance upon those departed ones."
5608,SECTION LXXIII.,"Beholding thee, O Rāma,who art adored of all creatures like unto the"
5609,SECTION LXXIII.,"Deity Himself, that mendicant woman, ever engaged in pious observances,"
5610,SECTION LXXIII.,"shall attain to the abode of celestials. O Rāma, turning to the western"
5611,SECTION LXXIII.,"bank of Pāmpa, thou shalt, O Kākuthshtha, behold the incomparable and"
5612,SECTION LXXIII.,secret asylum of Matanga. Fearing the divine authority of that great
5613,SECTION LXXIII.,"ascetic Matanga, the elephants, though there are many, dare not cross"
5614,SECTION LXXIII.,"the threshold of his asylum. O Rāghava, this forest is widely known as"
5615,SECTION LXXIII.,"Matanga-wood. Thou shalt sport, O Rāma, with a delighted heart in that"
5616,SECTION LXXIII.,forest resembling the celestial garden—_Nandana_ and filled with various
5617,SECTION LXXIII.,birds. There stands in front of Pampā the highly inaccessible mount
5618,SECTION LXXIII.,"_Rishyamuka_, ornamented with many a blossoming tree and guarded on all"
5619,SECTION LXXIII.,sides by little serpents. That mount is highly munificient. It was
5620,SECTION LXXIII.,"created by Brahmā in the days of yore. A person, sleeping on the summit"
5621,SECTION LXXIII.,"of that hill and dreaming of an accession of wealth, really gets at it"
5622,SECTION LXXIII.,after the dream is over. A perpetrator of iniquitous deeds and engaged
5623,SECTION LXXIII.,"in impious observances ascending that hill, the Rākshasas seize upon"
5624,SECTION LXXIII.,"him, asleep, and bruise him. Thou shalt hear the terrible roar of the"
5625,SECTION LXXIII.,"young elephants ranging in the asylum of Matanga, situated on the banks"
5626,SECTION LXXIII.,"of Pampā. Thou shalt furthermore observe many a quickly moving,"
5627,SECTION LXXIII.,"infuriated elephant, resembling clouds in hue and with red temporal"
5628,SECTION LXXIII.,"juice oozing out of their heads, roaming here and there sometimes"
5629,SECTION LXXIII.,"separately and again in a band. Those mighty elephants, roaming the"
5630,SECTION LXXIII.,"forest, return to their woody homes, drinking the pleasant, pure and"
5631,SECTION LXXIII.,"sweet smelling water of Pampā. And do thou assuage thy grief, beholding"
5632,SECTION LXXIII.,"there the bears, wolves and _Rurus_ of a tender countenance like unto"
5633,SECTION LXXIII.,"sapphire, who are harmless and never afraid of human beings. There is a"
5634,SECTION LXXIII.,"huge cave, O Rāma, in that mountain, covered on all sides with rocks and"
5635,SECTION LXXIII.,where it is very hard to enter. At the entrance of that cave lies a
5636,SECTION LXXIII.,"beautiful, wide lake of cool water, hedged on all sides with trees"
5637,SECTION LXXIII.,abounding in fruits. There liveth with other monkeys the virtuous-souled
5638,SECTION LXXIII.,"_Sugriva_, who sometimes resideth on the summit of the hill."" Having"
5639,SECTION LXXIII.,"thus addressed Rāma and Lakshmana, _Kavandha_, highly powerful"
5640,SECTION LXXIII.,resembling the sun in effulgence and wearing garlands appeared beautiful
5641,SECTION LXXIII.,"on the sky. Thereupon Rāma and Lakshmana, preparing to proceed spoke"
5642,SECTION LXXIII.,"unto that great one stationed in the sky, saying, ""Do thou go."" Whereto"
5643,SECTION LXXIII.,"_Kavandha_ replied, saying ""Do ye proceed to make good your end"" and"
5644,SECTION LXXIII.,"bidding them adieu, who were well pleased, departed. Regaining his"
5645,SECTION LXXIII.,"pristine beauty and shining in grace and effulgence that _Kavandha_, who"
5646,SECTION LXXIII.,"was on the sky, fixing his looks upon Rāma, and pointing out unto him"
5647,SECTION LXXIII.,"his way, said ""Do thou make friends with (Sugriva)""."

5703,SECTION LXXIV.,"towards the West. They wending their way desirous of seeing Sugriva,"

5705,SECTION LXXIV.,"summits of the mountains, blossoming with flowers and abounding in"
5706,SECTION LXXIV.,fruits tasting sweet like unto honey. Passing the night on the summit of
5707,SECTION LXXIV.,a hill those two descendants of Rāghu arrived at the western bank of

5711,SECTION LXXIV.,that one of perfect asceticism beheld those highly intelligent Rāma and
5712,SECTION LXXIV.,Lakshmana than she rose up with folded hands and touching their feet
5713,SECTION LXXIV.,offered them duly water for washing their feet and mouth. Thereupon Rāma

5719,SECTION LXXIV.,"attendance upon thy spiritual guide borne fruits?"" Being thus accosted"
5720,SECTION LXXIV.,"by Rāma that old _Savari_, of accomplished asceticism and recognised by"
5721,SECTION LXXIV.,"the _Sidhas_, approaching Rāma spake:—""Favoured with thy presence my"
5722,SECTION LXXIV.,"asceticism hath attained to its consummation. Blessed is my birth,"
5723,SECTION LXXIV.,fruitful is my service unto my spiritual guides and accomplished is my
5724,SECTION LXXIV.,"asceticism. O best of men, thou art the foremost of celestials;"

5729,SECTION LXXIV.,"_Chitrakuta_, the ascetics whom I served, ascending celestial cars of"
5730,SECTION LXXIV.,"incomparable lustre, departed to heaven. Those great ascetics, cognizant"

5732,SECTION LXXIV.,receive with great reverence that guest together with Lakshmana. On
5733,SECTION LXXIV.,"beholding him, thou shalt attain to that best land of the celestials"
5734,SECTION LXXIV.,"whence none returneth. O best of men, I was thus told, by those great"
5735,SECTION LXXIV.,"ascetics, and for thee I have collected various wild fruits growing on"
5736,SECTION LXXIV.,"the banks of Pampā."" Being thus addressed by _Savari_, the"
5737,SECTION LXXIV.,virtuous-souled Rāghava spake unto her conversant with the knowledge of
5738,SECTION LXXIV.,"past and future, saying, ""I have heard from Danu, in truth, about thy"
5739,SECTION LXXIV.,divine authority as well as that of thy spiritual guides. If thou
5740,SECTION LXXIV.,"purposest so I wish to witness it with my own eyes."" Hearing these"
5741,SECTION LXXIV.,"accents dropping from Rāma’s lips, _Savari_ showing unto them the vast"
5742,SECTION LXXIV.,"forest said, ""Do thou behold, O Rāghava, this forest, crowded with deer"
5743,SECTION LXXIV.,and birds resembling a dense cloud. This forest is known as Matanga’s
5744,SECTION LXXIV.,wood. Here in this forest the pure-souled preceptors sacrificed unto
5745,SECTION LXXIV.,fire their persons consecrated by the _Mantras_ as Mantra itself. This
5746,SECTION LXXIV.,"is that altar _Pratyaksthali_, ascending which my worshipful preceptors"
5747,SECTION LXXIV.,used to offer flowers unto the deities with hands trembling with toil.
5748,SECTION LXXIV.,"Behold, O best of Raghus, this altar of incomparable beauty, by virtue"
5749,SECTION LXXIV.,"of their asceticism, hath been still shedding its lustre on all the"
5750,SECTION LXXIV.,"sides. Behold, again, the seven seas have appeared here in conjunction,"
5751,SECTION LXXIV.,"at their very thought, worn out with fasts and therefore incapable of"
5752,SECTION LXXIV.,"moving on. Even those barks, which they used to place on these trees"
5753,SECTION LXXIV.,"after ablution have not yet been dried up. These flowers, of blue colour"
5754,SECTION LXXIV.,"which they offered unto the deities, being engaged in divine services,"
5755,SECTION LXXIV.,have not yet been withered away. Thou hast observed this entire forest
5756,SECTION LXXIV.,and heard every thing worth hearing. I purpose now to renounce my body
5757,SECTION LXXIV.,"being commanded by thee. I wish to approach those pure-souled ascetics,"
5758,SECTION LXXIV.,"whom I used to wait upon, and whom these asylums belong to. Hearing with"
5759,SECTION LXXIV.,"Lakshmana the speech of that pious one, Rāma gained an excess of joy and"
5760,SECTION LXXIV.,"exclaiming, ""Wonderful it is!"" again spake unto _Savari_ of keen"
5761,SECTION LXXIV.,"austerities,—""O gentle one, I have been worshipped by thee. Do thou"
5762,SECTION LXXIV.,"repair at thy ease and pleasure."" Being thus addressed and ordered by"
5763,SECTION LXXIV.,"Rāma, _Savari_, wearing matted locks, rags and the skin of an antelope,"
5764,SECTION LXXIV.,surrendered herself unto fire and rose high up in the welkin like onto

5766,SECTION LXXIV.,"garlands, sprinkled with sandal-paste and wearing celestial cloth she"
5767,SECTION LXXIV.,appeared of exquisite grace and lighted up the quarters like unto
5768,SECTION LXXIV.,"lightning. By virtue of her devout meditation, _Savari_ repaired to that"

5779,SECTION LXXV.,of those great ascetics. Thinking within himself about the divine
5780,SECTION LXXV.,"authority of those great ones, the virtuous-souled Rāma spake unto"
5781,SECTION LXXV.,"Lakshmana, devoted and ever engaged in his well-being.—""Beheld have I, O"
5782,SECTION LXXV.,"gentle one, the wondrous asylum of the pure-souled ascetics filled with"
5783,SECTION LXXV.,"diverse birds and tigers rambling friendly with antelopes. O Lakshmana,"
5784,SECTION LXXV.,we have performed ablutions in the sacred waters of these seven seas and
5785,SECTION LXXV.,offered oblations unto our manes. Our misfortunes have ended and
5786,SECTION LXXV.,prosperity hath appeared and my mind is now filled with ecstacy of
5787,SECTION LXXV.,"delight. Me-thinks, best of men, auspiciousness shall soon appear unto"
5788,SECTION LXXV.,"us; do thou come, therefore, we shall proceed towards the picturesque"
5789,SECTION LXXV.,"lake Pampā. Yon appeareth in view, at no distance, the mount Rishyamuka."
5790,SECTION LXXV.,"Here dwells with four monkeys, the virtuous-souled Sugriva— Suryya’s"
5791,SECTION LXXV.,"son, in constant fear of Vāli. I am in a hurry to behold Sugriva the"
5792,SECTION LXXV.,"best of monkeys, for my business—Sitā’s quest—is entirely at his hands."""
5793,SECTION LXXV.,"Unto the heroic Rāma, speaking thus, Saumitri said.—""Let us depart soon,"
5794,SECTION LXXV.,"I am in haste too."" Issuing out of Matanga’s asylum, the mighty Rāma,"
5795,SECTION LXXV.,"lord of men, repaired with Lakshmana to the lake Pampā. Exercised with"
5796,SECTION LXXV.,"grief, he arrived at the bank of that best of lakes, beholding (as he"
5797,SECTION LXXV.,"passed along), vaious trees and pools, the mighty forest covered on all"
5798,SECTION LXXV.,sides with huge trees and flowers and resounding with the noise of
5799,SECTION LXXV.,"lapwings, peacocks, woodpeckers and various other birds and rattling of"
5800,SECTION LXXV.,"the bamboos. Beholding, from distance, Pampā of sweet, cool and pure"
5801,SECTION LXXV.,"water, Rāma performed ablution at the Matanga Sara (a portion of Pampā)"
5802,SECTION LXXV.,"and paced slowly towards the lake. Thereupon Daçaratha’s son, stricken"
5803,SECTION LXXV.,"with grief, bathed in Pampā, covered with lotuses. It was adorned on all"
5804,SECTION LXXV.,"sides with _Tilakas_, _Asokas_, _Punagas_, _Uddalas_ and _Vakulas_. It"
5805,SECTION LXXV.,"was a lake girt on all sides with pictueresque gardens, having its"
5806,SECTION LXXV.,"waters undulating beautifully and transparent like unto crystal, and"
5807,SECTION LXXV.,covered all around with soft sands. It was filled with fish and
5808,SECTION LXXV.,"tortoise, adorned with trees on its banks, encircled with creepers"
5809,SECTION LXXV.,"embracing her like companions and frequented by _Gandharbas_,"
5810,SECTION LXXV.,"_Kinnaras_, serpents, _Yakshas_ and Rāshasas. It was covered with trees"
5811,SECTION LXXV.,"and creepers of various kind, of cool water, and enveloped with beauty."
5812,SECTION LXXV.,"It was, somewhere, of red hue, in contact with water lillies, somewhere"
5813,SECTION LXXV.,"white with _Kumudas_, somewhere blue with blue lotuses like unto a"
5814,SECTION LXXV.,blanket of diverse hues. It was filled with white and red lotuses and
5815,SECTION LXXV.,encircled with blossoming mangoe groves and resounding with the music of
5816,SECTION LXXV.,"the peacocks. Beholding Pampā, ornamented like a damsel with _Tilakas_,"
5817,SECTION LXXV.,"_Bijapuras_,⁹⁸ fig-trees, _Sukladrumas_,⁹⁹ flowery _Karavis_, blossoming"
5818,SECTION LXXV.,"_Punnagas_, groves of _Malati_¹⁰⁰ and _Kunda_,¹⁰¹ _Vandhiras_,¹⁰²"

5820,SECTION LXXV.,"and various others trees, Rāma the mighty son of Daçaratha began to"
5821,SECTION LXXV.,"lament with Lakshmana. ""There stands on its bank the mount Rishyamuka,"
5822,SECTION LXXV.,abounding in various metals and covered with trees of varieagated
5823,SECTION LXXV.,flowers as mentioned before (by _Kavandha_). There dwelleth the famous
5824,SECTION LXXV.,"lord of monkeys, Sugrivā, the heroic son of the great Rikshyaraja. O"
5825,SECTION LXXV.,"best of men, do thou approach the chief of monkeys."" Rāma, having truth"
5826,SECTION LXXV.,"for his prowess, again spake unto Lakshmana, saying, ""O Lakshmana, how"
5827,SECTION LXXV.,"shall I live without Sitā, who have been deprived of my kingdom, who am"
5828,SECTION LXXV.,"poorly and have Sitā for my life?"" Having said this unto Lakshmana, who"
5829,SECTION LXXV.,"had nothing else in view, that best of Raghus, racked with sorrow and"
5830,SECTION LXXV.,"grief and oppressed by Cupid, entered the lake Pampā graced with"
5831,SECTION LXXV.,"lotuses. Proceeding slowly, observing the forest, Rāma beheld and"
5832,SECTION LXXV.,"entered with Lakshmana Pampā, girt on all sides with beautiful woods and"

5865,SECTION I.,Repairing with Lakshmana to the lake Pampā filled with red and white
5866,SECTION I.,lotuses and fish Rāma having his senses agitated began to lament. And
5867,SECTION I.,beholding there that lake his senses were stirred with delight. Troubled
5868,SECTION I.,"with passion he spake unto Saumitri saying,—""Behold, O Saumitri, how"
5869,SECTION I.,"beautifully appeareth Pampā of transparent water like unto Baidurja,"
5870,SECTION I.,graced with full-blown red and white lotuses and various trees. Observe
5871,SECTION I.,"again, O son of Sumitra, the picturesque wood-land around the lake,"
5872,SECTION I.,"where trees, crowned with large branches resembling the summits of a"
5873,SECTION I.,"mountain, appear like so many hills. Mental agony arising from Sitā’s"
5874,SECTION I.,"ravishment and Bharata’s grief, have been grinding me who am already"
5875,SECTION I.,stricken with sorrrow. Verily conduceth to my felicity the pleasant lake
5876,SECTION I.,"Pampā of cool water, scattered with various flowers, covered with"
5877,SECTION I.,"lotuses, highly graceful, girt with variegated woods abounding in"
5878,SECTION I.,"voracious animals and frequented by deer and birds. This green common,"
5879,SECTION I.,"chequered with yellow and blue, appeareth of enhanced beauty by the"
5880,SECTION I.,various flowers of the trees as if covered with a blanket of diverse
5881,SECTION I.,hues. The tops of the trees rich with flowery bunches are gnarled with
5882,SECTION I.,"creepers of blossoming tips. Now hath appeared, O Saumitri, the fragrant"
5883,SECTION I.,"spring of pleasant breezes, when greatly prevaileth the influence of"
5884,SECTION I.,"Cupid and the trees are graced with fruits and flowers. Behold, O"
5885,SECTION I.,"Saumitri, the beauty of the woods, showering flowers like unto clouds"
5886,SECTION I.,"pouring forth rain. Various trees growing on rocky surfaces, moved by"
5887,SECTION I.,"the wind have been scattering flowers on the earth. Behold, O Saumitri,"
5888,SECTION I.,"the wind is sporting as it were with flowers dropt, dropping and hanging"
5889,SECTION I.,"on the trees. The bees, driven off and singing, pursue the wind, moving"
5890,SECTION I.,the flowery branches of the trees. While issuing out of the mountainous
5891,SECTION I.,hollows the wind is singing as it were and making the trees dance with
5892,SECTION I.,"the musical notes of the delighted cuckoos. The wind, making the tops of"
5893,SECTION I.,"the trees collide with each other, is as it were stringing them"
5894,SECTION I.,"together. The sandal-cool wind, of pleasant touch, ever removing the"
5895,SECTION I.,"exhaustion of toil, is blowing everywhere carrying with it pure"
5896,SECTION I.,fragrance. The trees in this nectar-smelling forest are sounding as it
5897,SECTION I.,were with the hum of bees. Hillocks overtopped with picturesque and
5898,SECTION I.,flowery trees stand beautifully on this mountainous expanse. Trees with
5899,SECTION I.,"flowery tops, tossed by the airy currents and crested with the bees, are"
5900,SECTION I.,"as if dancing in accompaniment with melodious strains. Behold, the"
5901,SECTION I.,_Karnikaras_ covered with flowers appear on all sides like unto human
5902,SECTION I.,beings decorated with golden ornaments and wearing yellow cloths. This
5903,SECTION I.,"spring, O Saumitri, sounded by the musical notes of the birds hath been"
5904,SECTION I.,kindling my grief who am without Sitā. Cupid hath been smiting me the
5905,SECTION I.,"more who am stricken with grief, and the cuckoos have been defying me,"
5906,SECTION I.,"displaying their mirth, O Lakshmana. At the pleasant fountains the"
5907,SECTION I.,delighted _Dātyuahas_ with their warblings have been afflicting me who
5908,SECTION I.,"am possessed by Cupid. Formerly my dear one, while in the asylum,"
5909,SECTION I.,"delighted with the music of these birds, used to attain to a greater joy"
5910,SECTION I.,"addressing me to hear them. Behold, birds of variegated hues, emitting"
5911,SECTION I.,"forth diverse notes have been alighting upon the trees, groves and"
5912,SECTION I.,"creepers from various quarters. O Saumitri, birds and bees of melodious"
5913,SECTION I.,notes accompanied by their co-mates and delighted with their mutual
5914,SECTION I.,companionship are on the banks of this lake. There live happily flocks
5915,SECTION I.,of delighted vultures. The trees sounded by the lascivious murmurs of
5916,SECTION I.,_Datyuhas_ and _Punskokilas_ have been kindling my amour. The fire of
5917,SECTION I.,"spring having clusters of Asokas as its embers, the hum of bees as its"
5918,SECTION I.,"sound, the redness of the twigs as its flame, hath been burning me. O"
5919,SECTION I.,"Saumitri, of what avail is this life unto me, not beholding Sitā of"
5920,SECTION I.,"sweet accents, having eyes with their eye-lashes, and a head of curly"
5921,SECTION I.,"hair. O blameless one, this season, when the groves become charming and"
5922,SECTION I.,"the border-lands resound with melodious strains of the cuckoos, is the"
5923,SECTION I.,"most beloved of my dear one. Methinks, this fire of distress,"
5924,SECTION I.,originating from amorous trouble and enhanced by the influence of
5925,SECTION I.,"spring, shall soon burn me down. My amorous feelings shall attain to an"
5926,SECTION I.,"intense height, as I do not behold Sitā before, whereas see the"
5927,SECTION I.,"beautiful trees around. Sitā, away from my vision and the spring, drying"
5928,SECTION I.,"up perspiration, have been both inciting my _amour_. That one having the"
5929,SECTION I.,"eyes of a fawn and ruthless vernal breeze, O Saumitri, have been"
5930,SECTION I.,oppressing me who am overpowered with anxiety and grief. These peacocks
5931,SECTION I.,"and pea-hens unfurling their wings like unto crystal lattices, have been"
5932,SECTION I.,dancing hither and thither. These maddened peacocks encircled by the
5933,SECTION I.,"pea-hens, have been aggravating my amorous desire who am already"
5934,SECTION I.,"possessed by the Cupid. Observe, O Lakshmana, there danceth with her"
5935,SECTION I.,"dancing mate on the mountainous expanse, the pea-hen, troubled with"
5936,SECTION I.,amorous sentiments. The peacock unfolding his charming wings is moving
5937,SECTION I.,after his dear mate mocking me as it were with his cry. Surely the
5938,SECTION I.,Rākshasa hath not brought my dear one in this forest of peacocks and
5939,SECTION I.,therefore they dance with their mates in this picturesque forest land.
5940,SECTION I.,It is unbearable for me to live without Sitā in this season of flowers.
5941,SECTION I.,"Behold, O Lakshmana, this attachment is to be seen even amongst the"
5942,SECTION I.,brutes. The pea-hen being influenced by passion is approaching her mate.
5943,SECTION I.,Sitā of expansive eyes would have thus neared me being influenced by
5944,SECTION I.,_amour_ had she not been carried away. In this season of spring flowers
5945,SECTION I.,of this forest are of no avail to me. These pleasant flowers of the
5946,SECTION I.,trees have been uselessly falling on the earth with the bees. The birds
5947,SECTION I.,exciting my desire have been delightedly warbling in flocks as if
5948,SECTION I.,"welcoming each other. Surely Sitā, under the influence of another"
5949,SECTION I.,"person, is lamenting in the same strain, as I do, if spring hath"
5950,SECTION I.,appeared there. Even if spring hath not appeared there how can Sitā
5951,SECTION I.,having eyes resembling full-blown lotuses live in my separation? If
5952,SECTION I.,"spring is there, what can it do her having a beautiful hip and loins,"
5953,SECTION I.,who hath already been overpowered by a mighty enemy? Surely shall my
5954,SECTION I.,"dear wife of a slender make, having eyes like lotus-petals and of sweet"
5955,SECTION I.,"accents renounce her life at the appearance of this spring? Methinks,"
5956,SECTION I.,"for certain, the chaste Sitā shall not be able to maintain her being at"
5957,SECTION I.,my separation. Vaidehi’s attachment is entirely centred in me and mine
5958,SECTION I.,"in her. This cool breeze of a pleasant touch, carrying the fragrance of"
5959,SECTION I.,flowers appears like a fire-brand unto me who am thinking of my spouse.
5960,SECTION I.,"That breeze appeareth painful unto me in Sitā’s absence which, ere this,"
5961,SECTION I.,had been regarded by me as a source of pleasure in her company. This
5962,SECTION I.,bird set up a cry in the sky at that time¹⁰⁷ and now sitting on the tree
5963,SECTION I.,is crying delightedly. This bird flying up in the sky brought about
5964,SECTION I.,Sitā’s ravishment and this bird shall take me to her having expansive
5965,SECTION I.,"eyes. Hear, O Lakshmana, the maddening notes of those birds sitting on"
5966,SECTION I.,the tops of the flowery trees and setting up their melody. The
5967,SECTION I.,_Vramaras_ are approaching the _Tilakas_ tossed by the wind like unto
5968,SECTION I.,"intoxicated damsels. This _Asoka_, enhancing the desires of the amorous,"
5969,SECTION I.,"stands here, as if remonstrating with me by its clusters shaken by the"
5970,SECTION I.,"wind. There appear, O Lakshmana, those blossoming mangoe trees like unto"
5971,SECTION I.,"persons, exercised with passion and smeared with unguents of sandal."
5972,SECTION I.,"Behold, O Saumitri, O foremost of men, the _kinnaras_ are ranging at"
5973,SECTION I.,large in this varieagated forestland on the banks of Pampā. Here the
5974,SECTION I.,fragrant red lotuses are shedding forth their splendour like unto the
5975,SECTION I.,newly risen sun. Here appeareth beautifully the lake Pampā of
5976,SECTION I.,"transparent water, filled with blue and fragrant lotuses, swans and"
5977,SECTION I.,_Karandhabas_ and abounding in red lotuses like unto the virgin rays of
5978,SECTION I.,the sun and having their filaments crushed by the bees. And the
5979,SECTION I.,"beautiful woods around the lake have been manifesting their beauty,"
5980,SECTION I.,filled with _chakrabakas_ and the herds of elephants and deer desirous
5981,SECTION I.,"of drinking water. Behold, Lakshmana, the picturesque view of the"
5982,SECTION I.,lotuses oscillated by the ripples driven to and fro by the wind. I do
5983,SECTION I.,"not delight in my life, not beholding Sitā, having expansive eyes like"
5984,SECTION I.,unto lotus-petals and ever fond of lotuses. O how wily is the course of
5985,SECTION I.,"Kāma who hath been presenting unto my mind that auspicious one, hard to"
5986,SECTION I.,attain and of sweet-accents! Had I not been overpowered by this season
5987,SECTION I.,"of spring with blossoming trees, I would have been able to put up with"
5988,SECTION I.,the present amorous infliction. The objects which appeared beautiful
5989,SECTION I.,"unto me while in the company of Sitā, now seem shorn of all grace in her"
5990,SECTION I.,"separation. My eyes pant for beholding those lotus-petals, O Lakshmana,"
5991,SECTION I.,because of their resemblance with Sitā’s eyes. Issuing out of the trees
5992,SECTION I.,"and touching the filaments, the pleasant wind is blowing like unto"
5993,SECTION I.,"Sitā’s breath. Behold O Lakshmana, the flowery branches of the"
5994,SECTION I.,_Karnikaras_ on the summits of the mountain situated on the southern
5995,SECTION I.,"bank of Pampā. This prince of mountains, beautified with various metals,"
5996,SECTION I.,hath been throwing up dusts of diverse colors driven by the wind. O
5997,SECTION I.,"Saumitri, these mountainous expanses are burning in beauty with"
5998,SECTION I.,blossoming and beautiful _Kinsukas_ void of leaves. These fragrant
5999,SECTION I.,"_Malatis_, _Mallikas_, _Karavis_ and lotuses, growing on the banks of"
6000,SECTION I.,"Pampā, and fostered by Pampā’s water, and _Ketakis_, _Sindhubaras_,"

6010,SECTION I.,and blossoming tree growing on the banks of Pampā and gnarled by
6011,SECTION I.,"creepers having flowery tips. Like unto inebriate damsels, these"
6012,SECTION I.,"creepers are embracing the trees, hard by, having their branches tossed"
6013,SECTION I.,"by the wind. The breeze, delighted with various tastes is passing from"
6014,SECTION I.,"tree to tree, mountain to mountain and forest to forest. Some fragrant"
6015,SECTION I.,"trees, covered with flowers and some with buds, appear beautifully"
6016,SECTION I.,"green. Saying, ’this is sweet’, ’this is pleasant’ and ’this is"
6017,SECTION I.,"full-blown,’ the attached bees are falling to the trees. And rising"
6018,SECTION I.,again they are approaching the other trees growing on the banks of
6019,SECTION I.,"Pampā. This forestland, strewn with flowers dropping spontaneously from"
6020,SECTION I.,"the trees like unto a bed sheet, hath become pleasant. O Saumitri, the"
6021,SECTION I.,"mountainous levels variegated with flowers, are appearing like unto"
6022,SECTION I.,"beds. Behold O Saumitri, the origination of flowers in the trees at the"
6023,SECTION I.,"expiry of the winter. The trees as if vieing with each other, have"
6024,SECTION I.,"blossomed in this season of flowers. The trees, O Lakshmana, with bees"
6025,SECTION I.,humming around and with flowery branches are as if welcoming each other.
6026,SECTION I.,"This swan, hath been sporting with its mate in the lucid water of Pampā"
6027,SECTION I.,"exciting my amour. Truly does this lake like unto Mandākini itself,"
6028,SECTION I.,deserve the accomplishments that are known all over the world. O best of
6029,SECTION I.,"Raghus, I do not desire Ayodhya or the dignity of Indra if that chaste"
6030,SECTION I.,"Sitā, be found here and if I can live with her. I shall renounce all"
6031,SECTION I.,desires and thoughts if I can sport with her in this picturesque and
6032,SECTION I.,"green forest-land. These trees, clothed in diverse flowery attires, have"
6033,SECTION I.,"been exciting my thought in this forest, who have been deprived of my"
6034,SECTION I.,"dear one. O Saumitri, behold this Pampā of cool water, enveloped on all"
6035,SECTION I.,"sides with lotuses, and frequented by _Chakrabakas_, _Karandavas_,"
6036,SECTION I.,"_Chraunchas_, _Plabas_ and high deer. Its beauty hath been further"
6037,SECTION I.,enhanced by the birds caroling. Diverse delighted birds have been
6038,SECTION I.,"exciting my passion, reminding me of my dear spouse, of blameless"
6039,SECTION I.,"countenance, having a moonlike face and eyes resembling lotus-petals."
6040,SECTION I.,"Behold on the yonder mountainous expanse of various colors, stags"
6041,SECTION I.,sporting with hinds and myself on the other hand forsaken by Vaidehi
6042,SECTION I.,having eyes resembling those of an antelope. These deer ranging hither
6043,SECTION I.,and thither have been distressing my soul. It is then only that I shall
6044,SECTION I.,attain to mental quietitude if I can behold Sitā on this charming
6045,SECTION I.,mountainous expanse filled with birds and deer. It is then that I shall
6046,SECTION I.,"draw my vital breath, O Saumitri, if Vaidehi, of slender waist, with me,"
6047,SECTION I.,enjoyeth the fine breeze of Pampā dispersing the fragrance of lotuses
6048,SECTION I.,"and _Saugandhikas_ and ever assuaging grief. Blessed are they, O"
6049,SECTION I.,Lakshraana who enjoy this wild breeze of Pampā. How hath that
6050,SECTION I.,"exquisitely fine daughter of Janaka, my beloved spouse, having eyes"
6051,SECTION I.,"resembling lotus-petals, brought under the control of another person,"
6052,SECTION I.,"been living forsaken by me? What shall I speak unto that virtuous,"
6053,SECTION I.,truthful king Janaka when he shall interrogate me about Sitā’s welfare
6054,SECTION I.,in an assembly? Where is that Sitā now who followed me in the track of
6055,SECTION I.,"virtue, who am unfortunate and have been exiled unto woods by my Sire?"
6056,SECTION I.,"How shall I keep up (my being) being poorly, O Lakshmana, being forsaken"
6057,SECTION I.,"by that Sitā who followed me, deprived of kingdom and sense? My heart is"
6058,SECTION I.,"sinking not beholding her fine spotless countenance, having eyes"
6059,SECTION I.,resembling lotuses and smelling sweet. When shall I hear again O
6060,SECTION I.,"Lakshmana, the sweet incomparable and auspicious accents of Vaidehi,"
6061,SECTION I.,intervened by smiles and couched in an elegant and easy style? That
6062,SECTION I.,chaste and exquisitely fine damsel even when afflicted in the woods used
6063,SECTION I.,to welcome me under the influence of Cupid as if she were delighted and
6064,SECTION I.,"had her sorrows removed. O son of a king, what shall I speak unto"
6065,SECTION I.,Kauçalya in Ayodhya when she will ask mc of her high-souled
6066,SECTION I.,"daughter-in-law’s welfare and whereabouts? Do thou proceed, O Lakshmana,"
6067,SECTION I.,and join Bharata gifted with fraternal affection. I am incapable of
6068,SECTION I.,"living any more without that daughter of Janaka."" Thereupon Lakshmana"
6069,SECTION I.,addressed unto the high-souled Rāma who was thus bewailing like one
6070,SECTION I.,"helpless with the following pregnant and immutable words. ""Forsake thy"
6071,SECTION I.,"grief, O Rāma. May good betide thee. Do not grieve O best of men. Even"
6072,SECTION I.,the sinless persons lose their seuse when they are afflicted with grief.
6073,SECTION I.,Remembering the grief consequent on separation do thou forsake thy
6074,SECTION I.,attachment unto thy dear one. Out of an excess of oil even the wick
6075,SECTION I.,"burneth itself. O worshipful one, even if he hideth himself in the"
6076,SECTION I.,"region under the earth or in a darker quarter, Rāvana shall not be able"
6077,SECTION I.,to draw his breath. Do thou procure information about that
6078,SECTION I.,vicious-souled Rākshasa; either he shall give up Sitā or meet with
6079,SECTION I.,"destruction. Unless he gives back Sitā, forsooth I shall kill him even"
6080,SECTION I.,"if he enters with her into Diti’s womb. Do thou, console thyself and"
6081,SECTION I.,"renounce thy poorliness of mind, O worshipful one. Without sufficient"
6082,SECTION I.,endeavours even men of energy do not regain their lost ends. O
6083,SECTION I.,worshipful one mighty is the course of energy. And than this there is no
6084,SECTION I.,greater power on earth. And there is nothing unattainable in this world
6085,SECTION I.,to one gifted with energy. Persons endowed with zeal do never wear away
6086,SECTION I.,in their actions. And resorting to this energy only that we shall regain
6087,SECTION I.,Jānaki. Do thou not percieve that thou art high-souled and highly
6088,SECTION I.,"educated? And leaving behind grief do thou forsake thy amorous madness."""
6089,SECTION I.,"Being thus accosted by Lakshmana, Rāma having his mind stricken with"
6090,SECTION I.,"sorrow, attained to mental quietitude renouncing grief and dolour."
6091,SECTION I.,"Thereupon Rāma, of unimaginable prowess, passed slowly by the pleasant"
6092,SECTION I.,and charming Pampā with banks girt with trees shaken by the wind.
6093,SECTION I.,
6094,SECTION I.,"Thereupon the high-souled Rāma, stricken with grief passed along"

6097,SECTION I.,"unagitated mind, intent upon Rāma’s welfare and wending like unto an"
6098,SECTION I.,"infuriated elephant, cheered him up by means of moral and heroic"
6099,SECTION I.,"counsels. Beholding their countenances passing strange, that mighty"
6100,SECTION I.,"chief, of monkeys, while ranging near the mount Rishyamuka, became"
6101,SECTION I.,"highly terrified and motionless. Observing them range there, that"
6102,SECTION I.,"high-souled monkey, wending slowly like unto an elephant and stricken"
6103,SECTION I.,"with fear and grief, became exceedingly sorry. Espying the highly"
6104,SECTION I.,"powerful Rāma and Lakshmana there, monkeys, terrified, entered into that"
6105,SECTION I.,"holy and pleasant asylum, a worthy refuge and having its inside always"
6106,SECTION I.,frequented by them.
6107,SECTION I.,
6108,SECTION I.,¹⁰⁷ This refers to the time when Rāma was united with Sitā _i. e._ at

6110,SECTION I.,sky set up an inauspicious cry indicating that in no distant time

6123,SECTION II.,stand (patiently) at any place. Beholding those two of great prowess he
6124,SECTION II.,could not make up his mind to remain there and the heart of that
6125,SECTION II.,"terrified monkey, sank. Pondering over what is more and what is less"
6126,SECTION II.,important the virtuous-souled Sugriva became highly anxious along with
6127,SECTION II.,"that monkey-herd. Beholding Rāma and Lakshmana, Sugriva, the king of"

6147,SECTION II.,"anxious. I do not observe here, O gentle one, the wicked-souled Vāli,"
6148,SECTION II.,thy elder brother of impious actions and whom thou dost fear and I do
6149,SECTION II.,"not percieve any terror proceeding from him. O monkey-chief, truly"
6150,SECTION II.,manifest is thy monkey-hood and it is through thy light-heartedness that
6151,SECTION II.,thou art incapable of fixing thy soul. Gifted with intellect and
6152,SECTION II.,knowledge do thou perform all by means of gestures. A king void of sense
6153,SECTION II.,"cannot govern all creatures."" Hearing those pregnant words of"
6154,SECTION II.,"Hanumān,Sugriva said in better accents—""Who is not terified beholding"
6155,SECTION II.,"those two mighty armed heroes, having expansive eyes, with bows, arrow,"
6156,SECTION II.,and daggers in their hands like unto two sons of a celestial? Methinks
6157,SECTION II.,these two best of men have been despatched by Vāli. Kings have many
6158,SECTION II.,friends. And it is not proper for me to place confidence in them. People
6159,SECTION II.,"should know that enemies, always treacherous by nature, range under"
6160,SECTION II.,"false guises. And those foes, availing of their credulity, bring about"
6161,SECTION II.,their destruction whenever opportunity presents itself. Vāli is
6162,SECTION II.,"eminently expert in despatching business. Monarchs, cognizant of many a"
6163,SECTION II.,"wily expedient, bring about others’ destruction. It is proper to discern"
6164,SECTION II.,"them by means of disguised spies. O monkey, do thou proceed under a"
6165,SECTION II.,"false guise and come by their intentions, examining them aright by their"
6166,SECTION II.,"countenances, gestures and words. Do thou ascertain their intention. If"
6167,SECTION II.,"dost thou find them delighted, secure their confidence in my favour, by"
6168,SECTION II.,eulogizing me again and again and giving out unto them my views. O best
6169,SECTION II.,"of monkeys,do thou ask them why they have entered this forest, if thou"
6170,SECTION II.,dost perceive that these two archers are pure-souled. Do thou determine
6171,SECTION II.,the fairness and unfairness of their purpose by means of their gestures
6172,SECTION II.,"and conversation."" Being commanded by that chief of monkeys, the son of"
6173,SECTION II.,Maruta purposed to approach Rāma and Lakshmana. Assenting to the words
6174,SECTION II.,"of the terrified and unconquerable Sugriva and saying ’Be it so,’"
6175,SECTION II.,"Hanumān, the high-souled monkey proceeded where the heroic Rāma was with"
6176,SECTION II.,Lakshmana.

6185,SECTION III.,"Thereupon renouncing his monkey shape, the son of Maruta, not confidihg"
6186,SECTION III.,"in them, assumed the semblance of a mendicant. Approaching them humbly,"
6187,SECTION III.,"Hanumān paid obeisance unto them. And he eulogized them truly in words,"
6188,SECTION III.,"sweet and pleasant. Greeting duly those two heroes, having truth for"
6189,SECTION III.,"their prowess, that best of monkeys addressed them in sweet accents in"
6190,SECTION III.,"consonance with Sugriva’s instructions. ""Ye are ascetics of celebrated"
6191,SECTION III.,"austerities, resembling the Rajarshis and celestials and best of"
6192,SECTION III.,"Brahmacharis, why have ye come here causing fear unto these deer and"
6193,SECTION III.,other wild animals of the forest? Surveying around the trees grown on
6194,SECTION III.,"the banks of Pampā, ye have enhanced the beauty of this lake of"
6195,SECTION III.,"auspicious water. Who are ye two youthful figures of mighty arms,"
6196,SECTION III.,"wearing bark, patient, sighing and troubling these wild animals? Heroic,"
6197,SECTION III.,"of leonine looks, gifted with mighty strength and prowess, slayers of"
6198,SECTION III.,"foes, and holding a bow like unto that of Sakra; graceful, of a pleasant"
6199,SECTION III.,"countenance, of prowess like unto a mighty bull, having hands resembling"
6200,SECTION III.,"the trunks of elephants, effulgent, great among men, youthful,"
6201,SECTION III.,"beautifying this chief of mountains with the effulgence of your persons,"
6202,SECTION III.,"worthy of having kingdoms, and like unto celestials, why have ye come"
6203,SECTION III.,"here? Having eyes resembling lotus-petals, heroic, wearing matted locks,"
6204,SECTION III.,"resembling each other, have ye come here from the celestial region?"
6205,SECTION III.,Verily the Sun and the Moon have come down to the earth of their own
6206,SECTION III.,"accord. Of spacious breast, heroic, having leonine shoulders, gifted"
6207,SECTION III.,"with high energy, stout like unto plump bulls and human albeit looking"
6208,SECTION III.,"like celestials, why are not your long, round arms, resembling"
6209,SECTION III.,_Paridhas_ and deserving all ornaments adorned? Methinks ye two are
6210,SECTION III.,"perfectly able to protect this entire earth, filled with forests and"
6211,SECTION III.,"oceans, and intersected by the mountains Vindhya and Meru. These thy"
6212,SECTION III.,painted and smooth bows appear like unto the thunder-bolts of Indra
6213,SECTION III.,adorned with gold. And these beautiful quivers are filled to the brim
6214,SECTION III.,with sharpened and deadly shafts like unto flaming fire and serpents.
6215,SECTION III.,"And these two daggers, of mighty proportions, furnished with burning"
6216,SECTION III.,"gold, appear like unto serpents, let loose. Why do ye not answer me"
6217,SECTION III.,"accosting you thus? A certain heroic and virtuous monkey-chief, by name"
6218,SECTION III.,"Sugriva, hath been journeying on this earth, distressed at heart, being"
6219,SECTION III.,driven away by his brother. I have come here being despatched by that
6220,SECTION III.,"high-souled Sugriva—my name is Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys. That"
6221,SECTION III.,virtuous-souled Sugriva desires to make friends with you. And know me to
6222,SECTION III.,"be his counsellor—a monkey, the son of _Pavana_, ranging every where at"
6223,SECTION III.,"my will, coming here, under the guise of a mendicant, from the mount"
6224,SECTION III.,"Rishymuka, for the welfare of Sugriva."" Having addressed thus those two"
6225,SECTION III.,"heroes—Rāma and Lakshmana, Hanumān, conversant with words and skilled in"
6226,SECTION III.,"speech, did not speak again. Hearing those words, the effulgent Rāma,"
6227,SECTION III.,"with a delighted countenance, spake unto his younger brother,"
6228,SECTION III.,"Lakshmana—sitting by him. ""He is the counsellor of the high-souled"
6229,SECTION III.,"Sugriva, the lord of monkeys and hath approached me, soliciting my"
6230,SECTION III.,"friendship in his (Sugriva’s) favour. Do thou welcome, with pleasant"
6231,SECTION III.,"words, O Saumitri, this monkey—Sugriva’s minister, the subduer of foes,"
6232,SECTION III.,affectionate and skilled in speech. None can speak thus who hath not
6233,SECTION III.,"mastered the _Rig-veda_, borne well the _Yajur-veda_ and acquainted"
6234,SECTION III.,himself thoroughly with the _Shyam-veda_. Forsooth he hath studied well
6235,SECTION III.,"all the Grammars, for he hath not used a single inelegant word though he"
6236,SECTION III.,hath addressed me with a number of them. And no defect was perceived on
6237,SECTION III.,"his countenance, eyes, forehead, brows or on any of his limbs. His"
6238,SECTION III.,"words,—few, beyond all suspicion, pleasant, and uttered in a mild"
6239,SECTION III.,"tone,—came out readily of his throat and breast. He has uttered accents,"
6240,SECTION III.,"wonderful, ready, accomplished, auspicious and captivating. Whose heart"
6241,SECTION III.,"is not moved by these wonderful words, proceeding from heart, throat and"
6242,SECTION III.,"brain)? Even an enemy, who hath his sword uplifted, (is moved). O"
6243,SECTION III.,"sinless one, how doth that monarch accomplish his objects who hath not"
6244,SECTION III.,"got such a messenger? Indeed whose emissaries are so accomplished, all"
6245,SECTION III.,"his missions are fulfilled only by virtue of their words."" Thus"
6246,SECTION III.,"addressed, Saumitri, skilled in speech, welcomed that monkey—Sugriva’s"
6247,SECTION III.,counsellor and son of Pavana. ’O learned one! We knew well the
6248,SECTION III.,accomplishments of the high-souled Sugriva. We shall find out that king
6249,SECTION III.,"of monkey herds. O Hanumān, O best of monkeys, we shall go by whatever"
6250,SECTION III.,"thou shalt say, under the instructions of Sugriva."" Hearing these"
6251,SECTION III.,"skillful words, that son of Pavana, delighted, revolving within him the"
6252,SECTION III.,"means for Sugriva’s conquest, purposed to bring about a friendly union"
6253,SECTION III.,between them.

6262,SECTION IV.,"Sugriva. Hanumān, getting exceedingly delighted, remembered Sugriva."
6263,SECTION IV.,"""Since this one of successful acts hath been come by and also this"
6264,SECTION IV.,"business is in hand, the high-souled Sugriva will most probably obtain"
6265,SECTION IV.,"the monarchy."" Then transported with joy, that foremost of monkeys,"
6266,SECTION IV.,"Hanumān, in these words, replied unto Rāma, deft in speech, saying, ""Why"
6267,SECTION IV.,"is it, that accompanied with thy younger brother, hast thou come to this"
6268,SECTION IV.,"dense and trackless forest, garnished with the wood-lands of Pampā, and"
6269,SECTION IV.,"rilled with various kinds of ferocious beasts?"" Hearing those words of"
6270,SECTION IV.,"his, Lakshmana, directed by Rāma, informed (Hanunān) of all about Rāma,"
6271,SECTION IV.,"the son of Daçaratha. ""There was a king named Daçaratha. Possessed of"
6272,SECTION IV.,"effulgence, and attached unto righteousness, he, in consonance with his"
6273,SECTION IV.,"proper duties, for aye, governed the four orders. He hath no hater; nor"
6274,SECTION IV.,doth he hate any one. And in relation to all creatures he was like
6275,SECTION IV.,another great-father. And he celebrated _Agnishtoma_ and other
6276,SECTION IV.,"sacrifices with presents (to Brāhmanas). This one is his eldest son,"
6277,SECTION IV.,"named Rāma, famous among men. He is the refuge of all creatures, and"
6278,SECTION IV.,competent to carry out the injunctions of his father. The eldest son of
6279,SECTION IV.,"Daçaratha, he is foremost of all his sons in merit. He bears marks of"
6280,SECTION IV.,"royalty, and hath the prosperity of a kingdom. Deprived of his kingdom,"
6281,SECTION IV.,"in company with myself, he hath come hither with the view of dwelling in"
6282,SECTION IV.,"this wood. And, O highly exalted one, this one of subdued senses is"
6283,SECTION IV.,followed by his wife Sitā even as at the decline of day the exceedingly
6284,SECTION IV.,effulgent Sun is followed by (his spouse) Splendour. I am the younger
6285,SECTION IV.,brother of this one endeued with gratitude and of various lore. Subdued
6286,SECTION IV.,"by his virtues, I, Lakshmana by name, have dedicated myself to his"
6287,SECTION IV.,"service. Worthy of happiness, homage, and intent upon the welfare of all"
6288,SECTION IV.,"beings, deprived of wealth and living in the forest, he hath his wife"
6289,SECTION IV.,"carried off by a Rākshasa, wearing shapes at will. Nor have we yet (been"
6290,SECTION IV.,able) to ascertain who is that Rākshasa that hath carried off his wife.
6291,SECTION IV.,"A son of Diti named Danu, had, by virtue of an imprecation, undergone"
6292,SECTION IV.,Rākshasa-hood. He it is who had related unto us all about the capable
6293,SECTION IV.,"Sugriva.— ""That exceedingly puissant one shall have a knowledge of the"
6294,SECTION IV.,"ravisher of thy wife."" Having said this, Danu beaming (with a halo) went"
6295,SECTION IV.,to heaven. Thus have I related unto thee all as it fell out. Both Rāma
6296,SECTION IV.,and myself have saught the shelter of Sugriva. Having given away profuse
6297,SECTION IV.,"wealth and attained high fame, this one who formerly was the lord of the"
6298,SECTION IV.,"worlds, now wishes to make Sugriva his master. That one attached unto"
6299,SECTION IV.,"virtue, that refuge (of all)—the son of that shelter (of all beings)"
6300,SECTION IV.,"hath come under the protection of Sugriva. That spiritual guide, who ere"
6301,SECTION IV.,now was worthy of being the shelter (of all) and who (actually) was the
6302,SECTION IV.,"refuge (of all creatures)—Rāghava, hath saught the shelter of Sugriva."
6303,SECTION IV.,That Rāma in whose happiness and favor the subjects found their
6304,SECTION IV.,"felicity, seeketh the good graces of Sugriva. Famed over the three"
6305,SECTION IV.,"worlds, the eldest son of that monarch who had always and for aye"
6306,SECTION IV.,"honored all the kings of the earth crowned with every virtue,—viz. Rāma,"
6307,SECTION IV.,"hath sought the protection of Sugriva, lord of monkeys. On Rāma being"
6308,SECTION IV.,"overwhelmed with sorrow, tried by grief, and having come under his"
6309,SECTION IV.,"refuge, it behoveth Sugriva along with the leaders of bands to show"
6310,SECTION IV.,"favor unto Rāma."" When Sumatra’s son shedding tears had spoken thus,"
6311,SECTION IV.,"that one skilled in speech, Hanumān, answered in these words, ’Persons"
6312,SECTION IV.,"of such a stamp, endeued with understanding, of controlled anger and"
6313,SECTION IV.,"subdued senses, should be seen by the master of monkeys; and such come"
6314,SECTION IV.,within one’s ken through blessed luck. He also hath been driven out of
6315,SECTION IV.,"his kingdom, and hath incurred the hostility of Vāli. And his wife torn"
6316,SECTION IV.,"away from him, he dwelleth in this wood, in fear, having been"
6317,SECTION IV.,"exceedingly harassed by his brother. That son of the Sun, Sugriva, along"
6318,SECTION IV.,"with us, will help thee in seeking out Sitā. Having said these sweet and"
6319,SECTION IV.,"hurried words, Hanumān said unto Rāghava, ’I will (now) repair unto"
6320,SECTION IV.,"Sugriva.’ When Hanumān had said this, the righteous Lakshmana duly"
6321,SECTION IV.,"paying homage unto the former, addressed Rāghava, saying, ’From the glad"
6322,SECTION IV.,"way in which this son of the god of the wind is speaking, it appears"
6323,SECTION IV.,"that he also seeks thy service; and, arriving (at this region) thou"
6324,SECTION IV.,"also, Rāghava, hast reaped success. He speaketh openly with a delightful"
6325,SECTION IV.,light in his countenance; and cheerfulness. (It seems) that the heroic
6326,SECTION IV.,"Hanumān, son unto the God of wind doth not speak anything that is"
6327,SECTION IV.,false.’ Then that vastly wise one Hanumān the son of the wind god
6328,SECTION IV.,"departed, taking with him the heroic descendants of Raghu, for"
6329,SECTION IV.,(presenting them) unto the monarch of monkeys. Renouncing the guise of a
6330,SECTION IV.,"beggar, and assuming the form of a monkey, that foremost of monkeys went"
6331,SECTION IV.,"away, placing those heroes on his back. And then the heroic monkey, the"
6332,SECTION IV.,"son of the wind-god, of wide fame, and great prowess, with his mind"
6333,SECTION IV.,"perfectly pure, considering himself as crowned with success, and"
6334,SECTION IV.,"experiencing exceeding delight, arrived at that best of mountains in"

6343,SECTION V.,informed the king of monkeys of (the arrival of) the descendants of
6344,SECTION V.,"Raghu. ""O exceedingly wise one, this one that hath come here is Rāma"
6345,SECTION V.,"having truth for his prowess. This is Rāma having truth for his prowess,"
6346,SECTION V.,"in company with his brother, Lakshmana. Rāma the son of Daçaratha, is"
6347,SECTION V.,"born in the race of the Ikshwākus. Ever doing the will of his sire, he"
6348,SECTION V.,"has been sent hither, in order that his father’s verity may stand in"
6349,SECTION V.,"tact. Rāma, who hath come to the forest, is the son of him who hath"
6350,SECTION V.,"propitiated Fire with _Rājasuyas_ and horse sacrifices,—dispensing"
6351,SECTION V.,Dakshinas and kine by hundreds and thousands—and who hath governed the
6352,SECTION V.,earth by asceticism and truthful speech. His son Rāma hath come to the
6353,SECTION V.,forest through a woman. While that high-souled one having his senses
6354,SECTION V.,"under control was dwelling in the woods, his wife was carried off by"
6355,SECTION V.,Rāvana; and he (Rāma) hath (in consequence) sought thy protection. Do
6356,SECTION V.,"thou, granting an interview unto the brothers Rāma and Lakshmana—both of"
6357,SECTION V.,"them worthy of homage— who are eager for thy friendship, receive them"
6358,SECTION V.,"respectfully."" Hearing Hanumān’s words, Sugriva—lord of monkeys,"
6359,SECTION V.,"becoming visible (at his will), gladly spake unto Rāghava, ""Sir, you are"
6360,SECTION V.,"versed in morality, and bear love towards all. The son of the wind-god"
6361,SECTION V.,"hath faithfully described your virtues unto me. That you, O lord, are"
6362,SECTION V.,anxious to contract friendship with me who am a monkey does me honor and
6363,SECTION V.,"is my gain. If you relish friendship with me, do you take this stretched"
6364,SECTION V.,"arm and my hand with yours,—and bind yourself fast with a vow."" Hearing"
6365,SECTION V.,"these sweet words of Sugriva, (Rāma) exceedingly delighted, pressed"
6366,SECTION V.,"Sugriva’s hand with his. And contracting friendship with Sugriva, Rāma"
6367,SECTION V.,"experiencing great joy embraced him warmly. Then that subduer of foes,"
6368,SECTION V.,"Hanumān, leaving off the guise of a beggar, in his native shape produced"
6369,SECTION V.,a fire with two pieces of wood. Then worshipping that flaming fire with
6370,SECTION V.,"flowers, he, well pleased, carefully placed it between them (Rāma and"
6371,SECTION V.,Sugriva.) Then Sugriva and Rāghava went round the fire; and (thus) they
6372,SECTION V.,"were fastened in friendship. And with delighted hearts, both of them—the"
6373,SECTION V.,"monkey and Rāghava began to gaze at each other, yet they did not feel"
6374,SECTION V.,"satiated. ""Thou art the friend of my heart. Our happiness and misery are"
6375,SECTION V.,"common,""—Sugriva, rejoicing greatly, said these words unto Rāghava. Then"
6376,SECTION V.,"spreading a beautifully blossoming spray of Sāla, full of foliage,"
6377,SECTION V.,"Sugriva made an awning and sat down with Rāghava. Hanumān, the son of"
6378,SECTION V.,the wind-god with great joy gave unto Lakshmana a bough of a sandal
6379,SECTION V.,"tree, plentifully blossoming. Next Sugriva, feeling high rapture, with"
6380,SECTION V.,"his eyes expanded with joy, answered Rāma blandly in sweet words,"
6381,SECTION V.,"saying, ""Oppressed have I been, O Rāma; and here am always afflicted"
6382,SECTION V.,"with fear. Deprived of my wife, I have, agitated with apprehension,"
6383,SECTION V.,"sought refuge in this dense wilderness. I am afflicted with fright, and"
6384,SECTION V.,"worried by fear, with my senses bewildered in this wood. Wronged have I"
6385,SECTION V.,"been by Vāli, my brother; and I have incurred his hostility, O Rāghava."
6386,SECTION V.,"And, O exalted one, do thou dispell the fear of me, who am tormented"
6387,SECTION V.,"with fear on account of Vāli. And, O Kākutstha, it behoves thee so to"
6388,SECTION V.,"act that I may not become subject to fear."" Thus addressed, the powerful"
6389,SECTION V.,"Kākutstha, knowing righteousness, and devoted to virtue, answered"
6390,SECTION V.,"Sugriva, smiling, ""O mighty monkey, that the outcome of amity is good"

6396,SECTION V.,"Vāli. Do thou today behold Vāli slain with sharpened shafts, resembling"
6397,SECTION V.,"venomous snakes,—like unto a torn hill lying on the ground."" Hearing"
6398,SECTION V.,"those words of Rāghava fraught with his welfare, Sugriva supremely"
6399,SECTION V.,"rejoiced, said these words, informed with rapture, ""Thou hero! Thou lion"
6400,SECTION V.,among men! by thy grace shall I obtain both my beloved and my monarchy.
6401,SECTION V.,"O God among men, do thou so deal with that foe, my elder brother, that"

6413,SECTION VI.,"hath related (unto me), the reason of thy arrival in this lone forest."
6414,SECTION VI.,"Thy wife, Maithili, daughter unto Janaka, separated from thee as well as"
6415,SECTION VI.,"the intelligent Lakshmana, and weeping (in consequence) was carried off"
6416,SECTION VI.,"by a Rāksha. Seeing for opportunities of doing mischief that Rāksha,"
6417,SECTION VI.,"having slain Jatāyu, hath caused unto thee the grief that comes of"
6418,SECTION VI.,separation from one’s wife. But thou wilt soon be relieved from the
6419,SECTION VI.,sorrow that comes of separation from one’s wife. Her will I bring like
6420,SECTION VI.,"unto the ravished Devaçruti. O repressor of foes, whether she be in the"
6421,SECTION VI.,"nether regions or under the sky, I will, bringing thy wife, make her"
6422,SECTION VI.,"over unto thee. O Rāghava, know my words to be true. O mighty-armed one,"
6423,SECTION VI.,"like unto poison, thy wife is incapable of being digested even by the"
6424,SECTION VI.,"gods and Asuras with Indra (at their head). O mighty-armed one, leave"
6425,SECTION VI.,"off sorrow, I will bring back thy beloved. From guess I find that it was"
6426,SECTION VI.,doubtless Mithilā’s daughter whom I saw when she was being carried away
6427,SECTION VI.,"by that Rāksha of terrific deeds. She was crying, ’Rāma, Rāma,"
6428,SECTION VI.,"Lakshmana, Lakshmana,’ and in the lap of Rāvana she looked like the wife"
6429,SECTION VI.,of the Snake-chief. Seeing me along with my four counsellors stationed
6430,SECTION VI.,"at the hill, she dropped down her scarf and her ornaments. All these, O"
6431,SECTION VI.,"Rāghava, I have taken and kept (with me). I will bring them. It behoveth"
6432,SECTION VI.,"thee to recognise them."" Thereupon Rāma spoke unto the sweet-speeched"
6433,SECTION VI.,"Sugriva, ’Bring (them), at once, my friend. Why dost thou tarry?’ Having"
6434,SECTION VI.,"been thus addressed, Sugriva swiftly entered a deep cavern in the"
6435,SECTION VI.,"mountain, with the view of doing what was dear unto Rāghava. Then taking"
6436,SECTION VI.,"the scarf as well as the ornaments. ""Look at this,"" (Saying this) the"
6437,SECTION VI.,"monkey held them before Rāma. And taking the sheet and the ornaments,"
6438,SECTION VI.,"(Rāma) had his eyes filled with tears, like the moon covered by the dew."
6439,SECTION VI.,"And from affection for Sitā, (Rāma,) his eyes filled with tears,"
6440,SECTION VI.,"deprived of patience, fell down to the ground. And placing the elegant"
6441,SECTION VI.,"ornaments on his bosom, he sighed again and again, like an enraged"
6442,SECTION VI.,"serpent in a hole. And seeing Sumitra’s son at his side, Rāma shedding"

6445,SECTION VI.,"fall from her person to the earth. Surely Sitā, while being ravished,"

6472,SECTION VII.,"manliness capable of pleasing others, I will speedily act so that thou"
6473,SECTION VII.,mayst be pleased. Do not be overwhelmed with grief: summon the fortitude
6474,SECTION VII.,that is in thee. Such lightness of sense doth not become persons like
6475,SECTION VII.,thee. I also have experienced mighty disaster arising out of separation
6476,SECTION VII.,"from my wife; but I do not weep in this wise,— nor do I forsake my"
6477,SECTION VII.,"fortitude. A despicable monkey as I am, I do not grieve for her,—and"

6482,SECTION VII.,"with firmness of understanding by help of their intellect, do not in"

6489,SECTION VII.,thou have recourse to manliness. It doth not behove thee to let grief
6490,SECTION VII.,"overcome thee. Those that indulge in sorrow, know no happiness; and"

6551,SECTION VIII.,Seeing Rāma seated at his ease in that best of mountains abounding in
6552,SECTION VIII.,"_Sāla_ flowers, and cheerful like the ocean, Sugriva from love spoke"
6553,SECTION VIII.,"unto Rāma sweet and excellent words, of which the letters vibrated with"

6569,SECTION VIII.,"dislodged hill."" Hearing Rāghava’s words, Sugriva—lord of hosts—felt"

6571,SECTION VIII.,overwhelmed am I by grief. Thou art the succour of those afflicted with

6579,SECTION VIII.,"speak aloud. And Sugriva suddenly restrained, before Rāma, the force of"

6588,SECTION VIII.,fear that oppresses me. My adherents are only these headed by Hanumān.
6589,SECTION VIII.,It is for this that although reduced to the greatest straits I have been
6590,SECTION VIII.,able to preserve my life. These affectionate apes protect me on all

6592,SECTION VIII.,"In brief, Vāli my elder brother, famed for his prowess, is my foe. Even"

6595,SECTION VIII.,"thee, the way in which my grief might be removed. Whether in joy or in"
6596,SECTION VIII.,"sorrow, a friend is the refuge of his friend."" Hearing these words, Rāma"

6605,SECTION VIII.,"Kākutstha, Sugriva, along with the four (other) monkeys, experienced"

6624,SECTION IX.,"to an encounter. My brother, who was fast asleep, hearing those dreadful"

6626,SECTION IX.,"rushed out in wrath, for the purpose of slaying that foremost of Asuras,"
6627,SECTION IX.,"he was opposed by his wives as well as myself, who humbled himself"
6628,SECTION IX.,"before him. But moving them aside, that exceedingly powerful one sallied"
6629,SECTION IX.,out. Thereupon out of affection I also went out with Vāli. And seeing my
6630,SECTION IX.,"brorher and me present from a distance, the Asura, seized with a panic,"
6631,SECTION IX.,fled with speed. And as he was rushing on in fear and when we had
6632,SECTION IX.,"proceeded further, the moon arising, discovered the way. And the Asura,"
6633,SECTION IX.,coming by a capacious and impregnable hole covered with grass (on the
6634,SECTION IX.,"surface), entered it amain; and we remained there. Seeing his enemy"
6635,SECTION IX.,"enter the hole, Vāli, overcome by anger, and with his senses agitated,"
6636,SECTION IX.,"spoke unto me, saying, ""Do thou, O Sugriva, carefully stay at the mouth"
6637,SECTION IX.,"of the hole, while I entering in, slay my foe in battle."" Hearing his"
6638,SECTION IX.,"speech, that subduer of foes was besought by me (for permission to enter"
6639,SECTION IX.,the cave along with him). But making me swear by touching his feet he
6640,SECTION IX.,"entered the cave. And after he had entered the cave, and as I remained"
6641,SECTION IX.,"at its mouth, a space of over a complete year rolled away. And seized"
6642,SECTION IX.,"with sorrow (I reflected), ’As I do not see my brother, he must be"
6643,SECTION IX.,"lost’—and my mind was alarmed, apprehending his death. After a long"
6644,SECTION IX.,"time, I saw frothy blood issuing from the cave. Thereat I was greatly"
6645,SECTION IX.,aggrieved. And roars of Asuras also reached my ears; but I could not
6646,SECTION IX.,"hear the cries of my superior, engaged in conflict. And from these signs"
6647,SECTION IX.,"concluding my brother to be slain, I, closing the mouth of the cavern"
6648,SECTION IX.,"with a crag, huge as a hill, and afflicted with grief, after performing"
6649,SECTION IX.,"his watery rites, came (back) to Kishkindhi, O my friend. And although I"
6650,SECTION IX.,"carefully concealed (the matter), the counselors heard it all. There"
6651,SECTION IX.,"they, assembled together, installed me (in the kingdom). And, as I was"
6652,SECTION IX.,"ruling the kingdom with justice, it came to pass that after having slain"
6653,SECTION IX.,"his foe, the Dānava, that monkey (Vāli) came to Kishkindhā. Then seeing"
6654,SECTION IX.,"me installed, he, with his eyes reddened in wrath, slaying my"

6656,SECTION IX.,"chastising him, yet my mind influenced by a sense of my brother’s"

6762,SECTION XI.,"a monarch of mountains in a mighty forest, —the great refuge of"
6763,SECTION XI.,"asceticism, the worker of the weal (of all), an Asura, celebrated by the"
6764,SECTION XI.,name of Himavān containing great cascades and furnished with many
6765,SECTION XI.,fountains and caves. He can compass thy incomparable pleasure.
6766,SECTION XI.,"Concluding that the ocean was afraid, that foremost of Asuras, presented"
6767,SECTION XI.,"himself in the wood of Himavān, like a shaft shot from a bow. Thereupon"
6768,SECTION XI.,Dundhuvi began to throw down many white crags resembling the foremost of
6769,SECTION XI.,"elephants; and sent up shouts. Then resembling white clouds, mild and"
6770,SECTION XI.,"possessed of a pleasing shape, Himavān, stationed on the summit, spoke,"
6771,SECTION XI.,"""O Dundhuvi, O thou that art attached to righteousness, it behoveth thee"
6772,SECTION XI.,not to distress me. I am the refuge of all those ascetics who are not
6773,SECTION XI.,"expert in military arts."" Hearing those words of that intelligent lord"
6774,SECTION XI.,"of mountains Dundhuvi, with reddened eyes, said:—""Afraid of me and hence"
6775,SECTION XI.,"void of energy if thou art incapable of fighting with me, do thou name"
6776,SECTION XI.,him who is ready to fight with me who am desirous of entering into
6777,SECTION XI.,"conflict."" Hearing these words the virtuous-souled Himavān, skilled in"
6778,SECTION XI.,"speech, spoke unto that great Asura, exercised with ire. ""O greatly wise"
6779,SECTION XI.,"one, there lives in Kishkindhā, of incomparable beauty, the mighty and"
6780,SECTION XI.,"highly graceful monkey—the son of Sakra, by name Vāli. That mighty wise"
6781,SECTION XI.,"one, skilled in warfare, is capable of fighting with thee on equal terms"
6782,SECTION XI.,like unto Namuchi with Vasava. Do thou speedily repair unto him if dost
6783,SECTION XI.,thou wish for a conflict. He is always expert in military exploits and
6784,SECTION XI.,"is hard to repress."" Hearing Himavān’s words, Dundhuvi, inflamed with"
6785,SECTION XI.,"ire, went to Kishkindhā—Vāli’s capital. Assuming the figure of a"
6786,SECTION XI.,"terrible buffaloe, with sharpened horns like unto a cloud big with"
6787,SECTION XI.,"water, ranging on the sky in the rainy season, and approaching the gate"
6788,SECTION XI.,"of Kishkindhā that highly powerful one set up a terrible roar, shakiag"
6789,SECTION XI.,the earth like unto the sound of a kettle-drum. Like onto an elephant he
6790,SECTION XI.,"felled, out of haughtiness, the trees around, and rent the earth with"
6791,SECTION XI.,his hoofs scraping it with his horns. Vāli was in the female-apartment
6792,SECTION XI.,"at that time, and unable to bear the sound came out with his wives like"
6793,SECTION XI.,onto the Moon with stars. Thereupon that lord of monkeys and other wild
6794,SECTION XI.,"animals, spoke openly unto Dundhuvi, saying, ""O Dundhuvi, obstructing"
6795,SECTION XI.,"this my city-gate, why dost thou set up a terrible roar? Dost thou know"
6796,SECTION XI.,"my mighty strength? Do thou save thy own life."" Hearing those words of"
6797,SECTION XI.,"that intelligent lord of monkeys, Dundhuvi, with reddened eyes spoke:—""O"
6798,SECTION XI.,"hero, it becometh thee not to speak thus before thy wives. Do thou enter"
6799,SECTION XI.,into conflict with me and thy prowess shall be ascertained thereafter.
6800,SECTION XI.,"Or I shall suppress my wrath for this night and do thou, O monkey, enjoy"
6801,SECTION XI.,"till the rise of the Sun. Embracing all the monkeys, inviting all thy"
6802,SECTION XI.,"friends, do thou, that art the lord of the monkey herds, honor them with"
6803,SECTION XI.,gifts. Do thou survey Kiskindhā and make thy children kings. And do thou
6804,SECTION XI.,"enjoy with thy wives—it is me that shall crush down thy pride. He, who"
6805,SECTION XI.,"destroyeth a person who is given up to drinking, reckless, emaciated and"
6806,SECTION XI.,"deprived of weapons, and one like thee, sunk in the abyss of"
6807,SECTION XI.,"voluptuousness, committeth the sin consequent upon the destruction of an"
6808,SECTION XI.,"embryo,"" Whereto replied Vāli, laughing, unto that wicked lord of"
6809,SECTION XI.,"Asuras, leaving aside all his wives, headed by Tāra. ""If thou art not"
6810,SECTION XI.,"afraid of fighting, do not consider me as one given up to drinking only."
6811,SECTION XI.,"Do thou regard this my attachment as a draught in this conflict, to be"
6812,SECTION XI.,"drunk by the heroes."" Saying this, Vāli, taking his golden garland,"
6813,SECTION XI.,"conferred on him by his father Mahendra, addressed himself for the"
6814,SECTION XI.,"conflict. Holding him by the horns, Vāli, that lord of monkeys, setting"
6815,SECTION XI.,"up a terrible roar, hurled Dundhuvi resembling a mountain. And bellowing"
6816,SECTION XI.,"a thundering voice, Vāli crushed (him) down. And blood began to trickle"
6817,SECTION XI.,down from the pores of his ears. Both of them desired to subdue each
6818,SECTION XI.,other—and thus there arose a terrible conflict between Vāli and
6819,SECTION XI.,"Dundhuvi. Thereupon fought Vāli equalling Sakra in prowess, by fists"
6820,SECTION XI.,"knees, legs, stones and trees. And thus there was a skirmish between the"
6821,SECTION XI.,monkey chief and the Asura. And in this conflict Asura’s strength was
6822,SECTION XI.,"greatly reduced, while that of Sakra’s son was highly enhanced. Holding"
6823,SECTION XI.,up Dundhuvi he threw him on the ground. And in that dreadful skirmish
6824,SECTION XI.,Dundhuvi was greatly reduced. And there was a profusion of blood falling
6825,SECTION XI.,from the ears of that one crushed down. Thereupon that one of mighty
6826,SECTION XI.,arms fell down to the earth and breathed his last. And taking up with
6827,SECTION XI.,"his arms that lifeless one, the mighty Vāli hurled him with great force"
6828,SECTION XI.,"at distance of a _yojana_. While thus thrown down by force, drops of"
6829,SECTION XI.,"blood, falling from his mouth, driven by the wind, fell upon the asylum"
6830,SECTION XI.,"of the great Saint Matanga. O great one, beholding the drops of blood"
6831,SECTION XI.,"there, the great ascetic, angered, thought within himself—""Who might be"
6832,SECTION XI.,"the author of this sprinkling of blood? Who is that wicked-souled,"
6833,SECTION XI.,"vicious-minded, stupid person, who hath all on a sudden sprinkled me"
6834,SECTION XI.,"with blood?"" Saying this, that best of saints issued out (of the"
6835,SECTION XI.,"hermitage) and surveyed a lifeless buffalo lying on the earth, like unto"
6836,SECTION XI.,a huge mountain. And apprehending by virtue of his asceticism that this
6837,SECTION XI.,"hath been committed by a monkey, he imprecated a mighty curse on the"
6838,SECTION XI.,"perpetrator (of that iniquitous deed).—""He shall not enter here who hath"
6839,SECTION XI.,spoiled the sanctity of my forest with showers of blood. And surely he
6840,SECTION XI.,shall be killed (on entering). Forsooth shall that wicked one cease to
6841,SECTION XI.,"exist if he strideth within a _yojana_ around my asylum, who hath felled"
6842,SECTION XI.,these trees by throwing the body of the Asura. His counsellors or any
6843,SECTION XI.,"one related to him, who shall resort to this my forest (shall meet with"
6844,SECTION XI.,the self-same fate). They shall not live here; hearing this from me let
6845,SECTION XI.,"them take their own ways. And even if they live here, forsooth, shall I"
6846,SECTION XI.,curse them too. This my forest is being protected by me every day like
6847,SECTION XI.,"unto my own son— and the monkeys are always used to destroy its leaves,"
6848,SECTION XI.,"trees and roots. Forgive them I to-day—but if I find any tomorrow, he"
6849,SECTION XI.,"shall be turned into stone for many thousand years."" Hearing those words"
6850,SECTION XI.,"of the saint, the monkey herd issued out (of the forest). And beholding"
6851,SECTION XI.,"them (coming out of the forest) Vāli spoke—""Why have ye all—the dwellers"
6852,SECTION XI.,"of the Matanga forest approached me—Is it all well with you?"" Thereupon"
6853,SECTION XI.,"they related unto Vāli, wearing a golden garland, the cause of the"
6854,SECTION XI.,"Saint’s curse by him and other monkeys. Hearing those words, Vāli"
6855,SECTION XI.,approached that great ascetic and solicited him with folded hands.
6856,SECTION XI.,"Disregarding him, the ascetic entered into his asylum and Vāli was"
6857,SECTION XI.,"overwhelmed with the fear of curse. O Lord of men, afraid of the curse"
6858,SECTION XI.,that monkey chief purposed to repair unto the mount Rishyamuka. Knowing
6859,SECTION XI.,"for certain, O Rāma, that he shall not enter this forest, I have been"
6860,SECTION XI.,"living here with my ministers, devoid of fear and grief. Here is the"
6861,SECTION XI.,"collection of Dundhuvi’s bones, killed on account of his own"
6862,SECTION XI.,"haughtiness, resembling a huge mountain. These are the seven huge _Sala_"
6863,SECTION XI.,"trees, clothed in branches, which Vāli could simultaneously divest of"
6864,SECTION XI.,"leaves by virtue of his prowess. I have related unto thee, O Rāma, the"
6865,SECTION XI.,"incomparable prowess of his. Do thou tell me now, O hero, how canst thou"
6866,SECTION XI.,"destroy him in the conflict?"" Unto Sugriva speaking thus, Lakshmana"
6867,SECTION XI.,"smiling replied:—""Performing what, shalt thou confide in (Rāma’s"
6868,SECTION XI.,"ability) to destroy Vāli?"" Thereupon Sugriva bespake him—"" These seven"
6869,SECTION XI.,"_Sala_ trees, before thee, the mighty Vāli, formerly pierced, all at a"
6870,SECTION XI.,"time, with one shaft. If Rāma can aim at one of these only with one"
6871,SECTION XI.,"arrow and if he can, O Lakshmana, throw the bones of this dead buffalo"
6872,SECTION XI.,"at a distance of two hundred bows—I shall consider Vāli slain."" Having"
6873,SECTION XI.,"addressed Rāma thus, Sugriva, having blood-red eyes, thought aside for a"
6874,SECTION XI.,"moment and again spoke unto Kākuthstha:—""He is heroic and proud of his"
6875,SECTION XI.,prowess—his heroism and strength are known all over the world. He is a
6876,SECTION XI.,mighty monkey and incapable of being repressed in a battle. His actions
6877,SECTION XI.,are such as are above the power of the celestials. Revolving them within
6878,SECTION XI.,myself and terrified I have repaired to this mount Rishyamuka. And
6879,SECTION XI.,"thinking of that lord of monkeys, unconquerable and irrepressible I dare"
6880,SECTION XI.,"not leave this Rishyamuka. And exercised with fear and anxiety,"
6881,SECTION XI.,"therefore, I have been wandering in this mighty forest along with my"
6882,SECTION XI.,"devoted counsellors, headed by Hanumān. And having secured in thee a"
6883,SECTION XI.,"worthy and sincere friend, O best of men, O thou that art loving unto"
6884,SECTION XI.,"thy friends, I have taken thy shelter like unto Himāvat himself."
6885,SECTION XI.,"Cognizant am I of the prowess of my highly powerful and wicked brother,"
6886,SECTION XI.,"but I have never witnessed thine in a conflict, O Rāghava. I do not"
6887,SECTION XI.,"compare thee with Vāli, nor do I disregard or frighten thee—forsooth"
6888,SECTION XI.,"have I greatly been alarmed by his terrible actions. O Rāghava, thy"
6889,SECTION XI.,"words, patience and figure are the proofs of thy heroism—truly do they"
6890,SECTION XI.,"bespeak of thy valour like unto fire hidden by ashes."" Hearing those"
6891,SECTION XI.,"words of the high-souled Sugriva, Rāma, smiling, spoke unto that monkey,"
6892,SECTION XI.,"saying—""O monkey, if thou dost not confide in my valour, soon shall I"
6893,SECTION XI.,"create thy confidence about my warlike abilities."" Having thus addressed"
6894,SECTION XI.,"Sugriva and consoling him, the highly powerful Rāghava, of mighty"
6895,SECTION XI.,"arms—Lakshmana’s elder brother, lifting up easily with his thumb the"
6896,SECTION XI.,dried frame of that Asura— Dundhuvi—hurled it at a distance of ten
6897,SECTION XI.,"_yojanas_. Beholding that Asura’s body thrown thus, Sugriva, again"
6898,SECTION XI.,"addressed unto the heroic Rāma, before Lakshmana and the monkey herd,"
6899,SECTION XI.,"the following pregnant words:—""Friend, formerly this body was wet and"
6900,SECTION XI.,"corpulent, and it was thrown with great difficulty by my brother Vāli,"
6901,SECTION XI.,"mad with voluptuousness. And O Rāghava, it is now divested of flesh and"
6902,SECTION XI.,hence light like unto grass and consequently it has been hurled by thee
6903,SECTION XI.,"with ease, O descendant of Raghu. And unable am I to ascertain who is"
6904,SECTION XI.,"the mightier? There is a good deal of difference, O Rāghava, between a"
6905,SECTION XI.,"body, wet and dried. There is still doubt, O worshipful one, which of"
6906,SECTION XI.,you is the mightier? Truly shall thy strength be manifested in the
6907,SECTION XI.,piercing of one of these _Sala_ trees. Having stringed the bow like unto
6908,SECTION XI.,"the trunk of an elephant and stretching it to thy ears, do thou shoot"
6909,SECTION XI.,this mighty arrow. Doubt that is none that this arrow flung by thee
6910,SECTION XI.,shall bore this _Sala_ tree. There is no need of discussion any more; do
6911,SECTION XI.,"thou perform O king, what dost thou think proper for me, contracted, as"
6912,SECTION XI.,"thou hast, friendship with me, with a solemn vow. Like unto the sun"
6913,SECTION XI.,"amongst the planets, like unto the Himalaya amongst the mountains, like"
6914,SECTION XI.,unto the lion amongst the quadrupeds thou art the foremost of men in
6915,SECTION XI.,"prowess."""
6916,SECTION XI.,
6917,SECTION XI.,
6918,SECTION XI.,
6919,SECTION XII.,SECTION XII.
6920,SECTION XII.,
6921,SECTION XII.,
6922,SECTION XII.,"Wearing those pleasant words of Sugriva, the highly effulgent Rāma, to"
6923,SECTION XII.,"create his confidence, took up his bow. That one, conferring honors upon"
6924,SECTION XII.,"others, holding his terrible bow and a shaft, darted it towards the"
6925,SECTION XII.,"_Sāla_, filling all the quarters with a sound. The arrow, clear as the"
6926,SECTION XII.,"gold itself, hurled by that one of mighty strength, perforating the"
6927,SECTION XII.,"trees,entered into the mountainous expanse and the sevenfold regions of"
6928,SECTION XII.,"the earth. And that shaft, gifted with wonderful velocity, piercing all"
6929,SECTION XII.,the trees entered again into the quiver. Having beheld those seven trees
6930,SECTION XII.,"bored by Rāma’s arrow, that monkey chief attained to an excess of"
6931,SECTION XII.,"surprise. Thereupon Sugriva, exceedingly glad, and delighted with his"
6932,SECTION XII.,"actions, bowing down his head on the earth and stretching his ornamented"
6933,SECTION XII.,"person on the ground, addressed with clasped hands, that heroic"
6934,SECTION XII.,"descendant of Raghu—Rāma, the foremost of those conversant with"
6935,SECTION XII.,"religious lore, with the following pious words—""O best of men, O lord,"
6936,SECTION XII.,"what of Vāli, thou art capable of destroying with thy arrows, in the"
6937,SECTION XII.,"conflict, even the celestials headed by Indra. O Kākutstha, who can"
6938,SECTION XII.,"stand before thee in a battle, who hath pierced the seven trees, and the"
6939,SECTION XII.,"mountain, and the earth with one arrow? Obtaining thee as my friend like"
6940,SECTION XII.,"unto Mahendra and Varuna, my grief hath been removed and I have attained"
6941,SECTION XII.,"to an excess of delight. Do thou, O Kākutstha, even to-day destroy, for"
6942,SECTION XII.,"my welfare, my brother Vāli. This I do pray unto thee with folded"
6943,SECTION XII.,"hands."" Thereupon embracing- Sugriva, of a pleasant countenance and like"
6944,SECTION XII.,"unto Lakshmana, the highly wise Rāma spoke unto him, saying, ""Soon shall"
6945,SECTION XII.,"we repair unto Kishkindhā.—Do thou go before, Sugriva, and invite thy"
6946,SECTION XII.,"false brother, Vāli, to battle."" Thereupon proceeding quickly to"
6947,SECTION XII.,"Kishkindhā, Vāli’s capital—they all stood waiting in that dense forest,"
6948,SECTION XII.,"hiding themselves under the trees. With a view to call Vāli, Sugriva,"
6949,SECTION XII.,"tying fast his cloth (around the waist) set up a terrible roar, as if"
6950,SECTION XII.,"rending the sky (therewith). Hearing the terrible uproar of his brother,"
6951,SECTION XII.,"the mighty Vāli, highly angered, issued out of his city, like unto the"
6952,SECTION XII.,Sun from the western shores (where he sets). Thereupon there arose a
6953,SECTION XII.,mighty conflict between Vāli and Sugriva like unto the planets Mercury
6954,SECTION XII.,"and Mars fighting with each other on the sky. The two brothers,"
6955,SECTION XII.,"exercised with ire, struck each other with palms like unto Acani and"
6956,SECTION XII.,"with fists resembling adamant. Thereupon Rāma, with bow in hand, beheld"
6957,SECTION XII.,"those two heroes resembling each other, like unto two Açwins. And"
6958,SECTION XII.,Rāghava did not discharge that mortal shaft untill he could perfectly
6959,SECTION XII.,"ascertain who was Vāli and who was Sugriva. In the mean time, being"
6960,SECTION XII.,"defeated by Vāli, Sugriva fled away and not beholding Rāghava, proceeded"
6961,SECTION XII.,"towards Rishyamuka. And wearied, worn out with blows, and having his"
6962,SECTION XII.,"person bathed in blood, he, followed by Vāli, angered, entered that"
6963,SECTION XII.,"mighty forest. Beholding him enter that forest, the highly powerful Vāli"
6964,SECTION XII.,"could not pursue him there for fear of the curse but said:—""Thou art"
6965,SECTION XII.,"released to-day."" And Rāghava too, with his brother and Hanumān, entered"
6966,SECTION XII.,"that forest, where the monkey chief Sugriva was. Beholding Rāma approach"
6967,SECTION XII.,"with Lakshmana, Sugriva, stricken with shame and casting his looks on"
6968,SECTION XII.,"the earth, addressed him poorly, with the following words:—""Accosting me"
6969,SECTION XII.,"with ’do thou call (Vāli),’ displaying thy valour and making me struck"
6970,SECTION XII.,"by the enemy, what improper, conduct hast thou shown by me? Thou"
6971,SECTION XII.,"shouldst have spoken me then truly, O Rāghava, —""I shall not destroy"
6972,SECTION XII.,"Vāli"" and I would not have gone there. The high-souled Sugriva speaking"
6973,SECTION XII.,"thus poorly, Rāghava again spoke unto him, saying:—""Do thou hear, O"
6974,SECTION XII.,"Sugriva, O worshipful one, why I did not discharge my arrow then. By"
6975,SECTION XII.,"ornaments, dress, stature and movements thyself and Vāli are just the"
6976,SECTION XII.,"same, O Sugriva. By voice, by words, by looks or by valour, O monkey, I"
6977,SECTION XII.,"could not make out any distinction. O best of monkeys, being thus"
6978,SECTION XII.,surprised by the similarity of your countenances I could not discharge
6979,SECTION XII.,that foe-destroying and quick-coursing shaft. I was so afraid of thy
6980,SECTION XII.,resemblance with Vāli that I thought that lest the mortal shaft might
6981,SECTION XII.,"destroy thee. O hero, O lord of monkeys, if any disaster befalleth thee,"
6982,SECTION XII.,"who art already overwhelmed with miseries, through my ignorance or"
6983,SECTION XII.,"childishness, they shall be known all over the world. Mighty is the sin"
6984,SECTION XII.,that ariseth from the destruction of one who hath been offered shelter.
6985,SECTION XII.,"Myself, Lakshmana, and that exquisitely fine damsel—Sitā—are all at thy"
6986,SECTION XII.,service—thou art our only refuge in this forest. Do thou again enter
6987,SECTION XII.,"into conflict, therefore, and do not fear, O monkey. And do thou behold"
6988,SECTION XII.,"even, in this very moment, Vāli, moving restlessly on the breast of the"
6989,SECTION XII.,"earth, wounded by my shaft. Do thou make some mark on thy person, O lord"
6990,SECTION XII.,"of monkeys, by which I shall be able to recognize thee when engaged in a"
6991,SECTION XII.,"duel (with thy brother). O Lakshmana, plucking this auspicious _Gaja_"
6992,SECTION XII.,"flower, do thou put it round the neck of the high-souled Sugriva."""
6993,SECTION XII.,Thereat that highly graceful one with the garland around his neck
6994,SECTION XII.,appeared like unto a cloud. And appearing in a graceful person and
6995,SECTION XII.,attentive to Rāma’s words he again entered Kishkindhā with him.
6996,SECTION XII.,
6997,SECTION XII.,
6998,SECTION XII.,
6999,SECTION XIII.,SECTION XIII.
7000,SECTION XIII.,
7001,SECTION XIII.,
7002,SECTION XIII.,"Thereupon the high-souled Rāma, along with Sugriva, proceeded from the"
7003,SECTION XIII.,"mount Rishyamuka to Kishkiudhā, maintained by Vāli’s prowess, raising up"
7004,SECTION XIII.,his gold crested mighty bow and taking his battle arrows like unto
7005,SECTION XIII.,"Aditya. The mighty Sugriva, bending low, proceeded before the"
7006,SECTION XIII.,high-souled Rāma and Lakshmana. They were followed by the heroic
7007,SECTION XIII.,"Hanumān, the mighty Nala and Neela, and the highly powerful Tāra, the"
7008,SECTION XIII.,"leader of the monkey herd. They beheld as they proceeded, trees, lowered"
7009,SECTION XIII.,"down with the weight of flowers, rivers of clear water flowing to the"
7010,SECTION XIII.,"ocean, mountain hollows, hills, caves, cavities, and principal peaks and"
7011,SECTION XIII.,"charming rills. They beheld on their way, pools filled with water clear"
7012,SECTION XIII.,"as _Baidurya_ and beautified with lotuses—full blown and buds, and"
7013,SECTION XIII.,"resounded with the cries of _Kārandhabas_, swans, geese, _Banchulas_,"
7014,SECTION XIII.,"water-fowls, _Chakrabakas_, and various other birds. They surveyed all"
7015,SECTION XIII.,"around in the forest-land, deer ranging fearlessly at large and grazing"
7016,SECTION XIII.,on tender grass. They beheld frightful wild elephants having white
7017,SECTION XIII.,"teeth, ranging alone—the destroyers of river banks and enemies of pools."
7018,SECTION XIII.,"And observing many an infuriated monkey like unto elephants, resembling"
7019,SECTION XIII.,so many moveable mountains riving the mountainous expanses crusted with
7020,SECTION XIII.,"dust, and many other wild beasts and birds the followers of Sugriva"
7021,SECTION XIII.,"wended their way. They proceeding quickly, Rāma, the descendant of"
7022,SECTION XIII.,"Raghu, beholding the forest filled with trees, spake unto Sugriva,"
7023,SECTION XIII.,"saying—""These trees skirted by plantain groves, dense as a collection of"
7024,SECTION XIII.,"clouds, appear as clouds in the sky. Great is my curiosity, O friend, to"
7025,SECTION XIII.,"learn what are these. And I wish to have my curiosity removed by thee."""
7026,SECTION XIII.,"Hearing the words of the high-souled Rāghava, Sugriva began to describe"
7027,SECTION XIII.,"that great forest.—""In this extensive asylum, O Rāghava, removing the"
7028,SECTION XIII.,toil (of the travellers) filled with gardens and trees and abounding in
7029,SECTION XIII.,"delicious fruits, roots and water, dwelt seven Saints, having control"
7030,SECTION XIII.,"over their senses. Those seven Saints, dwelling on the mountain, passed"
7031,SECTION XIII.,days and nights in water with their heads down and after seven nights
7032,SECTION XIII.,"used to live upon air. In this wise, passing seven hundred years they"
7033,SECTION XIII.,"repaired bodily unto heaven. By virtue of their asceticism, this asylum"
7034,SECTION XIII.,"is walled by trees and incapable of being conquerred even by Indra, the"
7035,SECTION XIII.,celestials and the Asuras. Birds or other wild animals do not enter this
7036,SECTION XIII.,asylum; whoever entereth this by mistake never returneth. There is
7037,SECTION XIII.,"audible, O Rāghava, the sound of the dressing of Apsarās. their"
7038,SECTION XIII.,sweet-winged accents and that of their music and drums; and herein
7039,SECTION XIII.,pervadeth the celestial fragrance. Hereburneth the fire _Tretā_; and the
7040,SECTION XIII.,smoke and cloud sable like unto the wings of a pigeon envelope the tops
7041,SECTION XIII.,"of the trees. And there appear the trees, having their tops saturated"
7042,SECTION XIII.,"with smoke and cloaked with clouds, like unto so many _Baidurya_ hills."
7043,SECTION XIII.,"Do thou, O Rāghava, O virtuous-souled one, make obeisance unto them"
7044,SECTION XIII.,"along with thy brother Lakshmana, with concentrated heart and folded"
7045,SECTION XIII.,"palms. There resteth no sin in their persons, O Rāma, who bow unto those"
7046,SECTION XIII.,"self-controlled Saints."" Thereupon Rāma, along with his younger brother"
7047,SECTION XIII.,"Lakshmana, made obeisance unto those high-souled ones. And having paid"
7048,SECTION XIII.,homage (unto the sacred memory of those great ones) the virtuous-souled
7049,SECTION XIII.,"Rāma, his (younger) brother Lakshmana, Sugriva and other monkeys,"
7050,SECTION XIII.,proceeded with delighted hearts. And wending a distant way from that
7051,SECTION XIII.,"hermitage of the seven great ones, they beheld Kishkindhā, hard to"
7052,SECTION XIII.,"conquer and occupied by Vāli. Thereupon, Rāma, his younger brother and"
7053,SECTION XIII.,"the monkeys taking their weapons, entered, to encompass the destruction"

7064,SECTION XIV.,"his looks all around in the forest, Sugriva, having a huge neck and fond"
7065,SECTION XIV.,"of woods, became exceedingly enraged. Setting up a terrible uproar and"
7066,SECTION XIV.,"rending the sky with his cry (Sugriva) encircled by his kinsmen, invited"
7067,SECTION XIV.,"(Vāli) to battle. Thereupon roaring like unto a huge cloud, preceded by"
7068,SECTION XIV.,"a mighty wind, Sugriva, gifted with leonine motion, and resembling the"
7069,SECTION XIV.,"newly risen Sun, finding Rāma expert in business, spake unto him,"
7070,SECTION XIV.,"saying:—""Thou hast readied Kishkindhā, Vāli’s capital, adorned with"
7071,SECTION XIV.,"gold, filled with pennons and instruments and surrounded by monkeys. Do"
7072,SECTION XIV.,"thou make good thy promise, O hero, thou hadst made before to encompass"
7073,SECTION XIV.,the destruction of Vāli like unto the season making the creepers filled
7074,SECTION XIV.,"with fruits."" Being thus accosted by Sugriva, the virtuous-souled"
7075,SECTION XIV.,"Rāghava, the slayer of foes, addressed him with the following"
7076,SECTION XIV.,"words:—""Uprooting the _Gaja_ creeper, Lakshmana, hath placed it around"
7077,SECTION XIV.,thy neck as an emblem (to distinguish thee). Thou dost appear more
7078,SECTION XIV.,"beautiful, O hero, with this creeper around thy neck like unto the sun"
7079,SECTION XIV.,"on the sky engarlanded by the stars. I shall, O monkey, by the discharge"
7080,SECTION XIV.,of one shaft in the conflict destroy thy fear and enmity proceeding from
7081,SECTION XIV.,"Vāli. Do thou show me, O Sugriva, thy enemy, in the guise of a brother."
7082,SECTION XIV.,Wounded (by my shaft) Vāli shall roll in the dust in the forest. And if
7083,SECTION XIV.,"regaining his life he comes in thy view, do thou leave this field,"
7084,SECTION XIV.,showering abuses upon me. Thou didst behold seven _Talas_ riven by a
7085,SECTION XIV.,single shaft of mine and did thou therefore consider Vāli destroyed
7086,SECTION XIV.,"to-day by my prowess in the conflict. Though fallen in distress before,"
7087,SECTION XIV.,"I never spoke an untruth, being always guided by an inclination to"
7088,SECTION XIV.,acquire virtue. Like unto the deity of hundred sacrifices causing the
7089,SECTION XIV.,"rice fields bring forth their fruits by means of profuse showers, I"
7090,SECTION XIV.,shall fulfill my promise by dint of my prowess. Do thou therefore
7091,SECTION XIV.,"renounce all doubts about it. Do thou call Vāli, wearing a golden"
7092,SECTION XIV.,"garland. Do thou make such a sound, O Sugriva, as may bring out that"
7093,SECTION XIV.,"monkey chief (from his city). He hath subdued his breath, is proud of"
7094,SECTION XIV.,victory and fond of warfare; thou couldst not repress him before.
7095,SECTION XIV.,"Forsooth that Vāli shall come out, leaving the company (of his wives)."
7096,SECTION XIV.,"Hearing the war cry of his enemy, he shall never put up with it,"
7097,SECTION XIV.,"specially, as he boasteth of his prowess before his wives."" Hearing"
7098,SECTION XIV.,"Rāma’s words. Sugriva, having a gold-yellow hue, set up a terrible roar,"
7099,SECTION XIV.,"as if riving the sky. Terrified by that sound, the kine, losing their"
7100,SECTION XIV.,"countenance do move hither and thither like unto damsels, oppressed on"
7101,SECTION XIV.,account of their kings’ neglecting (to protect them). And the deer fly
7102,SECTION XIV.,away like unto the horses defeated in a warfare. And the birds fall down
7103,SECTION XIV.,"on the earth, like unto planets, losing their purity. Thereupon"
7104,SECTION XIV.,"confiding in Rāma’s words, that son, of Suryya (Sun) having his energy"
7105,SECTION XIV.,enhanced by means of his prowess resembling the ocean agitated by the
7106,SECTION XIV.,"wind, began to roar like unto cloud."

7111,SECTION XV.,
7112,SECTION XV.,
7113,SECTION XV.,"While residing in the female apartment, Vāli heard the uproar of that"
7114,SECTION XV.,"high-souled Sugriva—his wrathful brother. And hearing that mighty roar,"
7115,SECTION XV.,"shaking the whole world of creation, his pride was in no time, crushed"
7116,SECTION XV.,"and he attained an excess of ire. Thereupon, Vāli, having a golden hue,"
7117,SECTION XV.,"greatly exercised with wrath, instantly lost the effulgence of his"
7118,SECTION XV.,person like unto the sun possessed by Rāhu. And looking terrible by his
7119,SECTION XV.,teeth and having eyes resembling burning fire in consequence of ire he
7120,SECTION XV.,"appeared like unto a pond, having the lotuses thereof uprooted with"
7121,SECTION XV.,"their stalks and fibres. And hearing that unbearable sound, the monkey,"
7122,SECTION XV.,"issued out speedily, as if riving the earth with his foot marks."
7123,SECTION XV.,"Embracing him warmly and showing her affection, Tārā, afraid and"
7124,SECTION XV.,"mortified, addressed him with the following words, presaging his future"
7125,SECTION XV.,"welfare:—""Do thou renounce, O hero, this thy ire, coming like the course"
7126,SECTION XV.,"of a river, like unto one, leaving aside the garland, which he used in"
7127,SECTION XV.,"the night, after rising from bed. O monkey chief, do thou engage with"
7128,SECTION XV.,"him in conflict, tomorrow. O hero, thy enemy is very insignificant and"
7129,SECTION XV.,hence there will be no deterioration on thy part. Thy hastily issuing
7130,SECTION XV.,"out doth not please me; do thou hear, why I do prevent thee. Formerly"
7131,SECTION XV.,this Sugriva invited thee angrily to battle and being defeated and
7132,SECTION XV.,"wounded by thee fled away. That one, who had been defeated and harassed"
7133,SECTION XV.,"by thee formerly, is now calling thee. Indeed it hath excited my fear."
7134,SECTION XV.,"His pride, his energy, and his terrible uproar do indicate that there is"
7135,SECTION XV.,nothing insignificant (at the bottom). I do not think Sugriva has come
7136,SECTION XV.,here without any to assist him. Forsooth he hath taken shelter of some
7137,SECTION XV.,"body, and securing which he hath been setting up such a terrible uproar."
7138,SECTION XV.,That monkey is clever by nature and gifted with intellect. And Sugriva
7139,SECTION XV.,shall not desire friendship with any one without having a test of his
7140,SECTION XV.,"prowess. Hearken, O hero, I shall relate unto thee today, the auspicious"
7141,SECTION XV.,"words, I heard ere this, from the prince Angada. He hath related unto me"
7142,SECTION XV.,"all about Sugriva, what be heard from bis emmissaries while journeying"
7143,SECTION XV.,in the forest. The two heroic sons of the king of Ayodhyā—Rāma and
7144,SECTION XV.,"Lakshmana, incapable of being defeated in a battle and born in the race"
7145,SECTION XV.,"of Ikshawkus, have repaired unto woods. To accomplish Sugriva’s welfare,"
7146,SECTION XV.,"those two heroes, hard to repress, have come here. He is the main stay"
7147,SECTION XV.,of thy brother in the battle; Rāma hath sprung up like unto the fire of
7148,SECTION XV.,dissolution and is the repressor of enemy’s prowess. He is the refuge of
7149,SECTION XV.,the saints and the prime shelter of the afflicted. He is the protector
7150,SECTION XV.,of those grinded by their enemies and is the only possessor of fame. He
7151,SECTION XV.,is gifted with knowledge and intellect and ever abideth by his sire’s
7152,SECTION XV.,"commandments. Like unto Himalaya, the king of mountains, containing"
7153,SECTION XV.,"diverse metals, he is the mine of various accomplishments. It doth not"
7154,SECTION XV.,"behove thee therefore to enter into conflict with that high-souled Rāma,"
7155,SECTION XV.,"incomparable in prowess and hard to conquer in battle. Hearken, O hero,"
7156,SECTION XV.,I desire to speak something more —I do not wish to excite thy wrath. Do
7157,SECTION XV.,"thou instantly confer upon Sugriva, the dignity of heir apparent (to thy"
7158,SECTION XV.,"throne). O hero, O king; do not quarrel with thy younger brother. I do"
7159,SECTION XV.,consider it thy welfare to contract friendship with Rāma and regain
7160,SECTION XV.,"Sugriva’s affections, renouncing all thy inimical feelings. This thy"
7161,SECTION XV.,"younger brother, even when remaining at a distance, should always be"
7162,SECTION XV.,"maintained by thee. Whether by thee, or at a distance, he is always thy"
7163,SECTION XV.,best friend—I do not find his equal on earth. By conferring on him gifts
7164,SECTION XV.,and honors do thou receive him back. And do thou renounce thy enmity and
7165,SECTION XV.,"let him sit by thee. Methinks, that large-necked Sugriva is thy best"
7166,SECTION XV.,friend—there is no other resource for thee than to secure thy brother’s
7167,SECTION XV.,"friendship. If thou dost wish to go by my desire, if thou dost regard me"
7168,SECTION XV.,"as thy well-wisher, do thou perform what I do request thee for thy"
7169,SECTION XV.,welfare. Be pleased and hear my beneficial words. It doth not behove
7170,SECTION XV.,thee to yield to the influence of ire —thy conflict with that son of the
7171,SECTION XV.,"king; of Koçala, gifted with the prowess of Sakra, will not conduce to"
7172,SECTION XV.,"thy welfare."" Thereupon Tārā spoke unto Vāli these suitable and"
7173,SECTION XV.,"well-meaning words—but they did not satisfy him, possessed by Kāla, as"
7174,SECTION XV.,"he was, on the eve of his destruction."

7179,SECTION XVI.,
7180,SECTION XVI.,
7181,SECTION XVI.,"After Tārā, having a moon-like countenance, had spoken thus, Vāli,"
7182,SECTION XVI.,"remonstrated with her and said—""O thou of exquisite loveliness, my"
7183,SECTION XVI.,"brother, and specially my enemy, is roaring lowly and haughtily—and how"
7184,SECTION XVI.,"shall I put up with it? O timid damsel, heroes, who have never been"
7185,SECTION XVI.,"defeated and have never fled away from the battle field, had rather meet"
7186,SECTION XVI.,with death than put up with this ignominy. I am incapable of bearing
7187,SECTION XVI.,"this proud uproar of Sugriva, having a defective neck and desirous of"
7188,SECTION XVI.,"entering into conflict with me. Fearing danger from Rāghava, thou needst"
7189,SECTION XVI.,not entertain any anxiety on my account. Why shall that virtuous-souled
7190,SECTION XVI.,and grateful Rāma perpetrate iniquity? Do thou therefore return with my
7191,SECTION XVI.,other wives. Why do thou follow me again? Thou hast already shown thy
7192,SECTION XVI.,"friendship and respect for me. I shall repairing thither, only fight"
7193,SECTION XVI.,with Sugriva. I shall crush down his pride and not destroy him. I shall
7194,SECTION XVI.,deal with him mercifully in the battle as thou dost wish and being
7195,SECTION XVI.,"struck with fists and trees he shall fly away. Forsooth, that"
7196,SECTION XVI.,vicious-souled one shall not be able to withstand my pride and
7197,SECTION XVI.,"proficient skill in warfare. O Tārā, thou hast already displayed thy"
7198,SECTION XVI.,"attachment unto me by giving me good counsels. By my life, do thou go"
7199,SECTION XVI.,"back with the other members of my household, I shall only return after"
7200,SECTION XVI.,"bringing about the discomfiture of my brother in the battle."" Thereupon,"
7201,SECTION XVI.,"Tārā, dexterous and of sweet accents, embracing Vāli, went round him,"
7202,SECTION XVI.,with tears trickling from her eyes. And having performed _Sastayana_ or
7203,SECTION XVI.,"the ceremony of benediction, that one gifted with a knowledge of"
7204,SECTION XVI.,"Mantras, and desirous of Vāli’s success, went, overwhelmed with grief,"
7205,SECTION XVI.,to the inner-apartment in the company of other females. After Tārā had
7206,SECTION XVI.,"departed to her own quarters with her female companions, he issued out"
7207,SECTION XVI.,"of the city sighing like an enraged serpent. And the quick-paced Vāli,"
7208,SECTION XVI.,"exceedingly wroth, sighing, cast his looks around with a view to behold"
7209,SECTION XVI.,"his enemy. And that highly efiulgent one espied Sugriva, having a golden"
7210,SECTION XVI.,"yellow hue, tightly clothed, standing firm on the earth and shining like"
7211,SECTION XVI.,"unto burning gold. And beholding Sugriva stationed thus, the greatly"
7212,SECTION XVI.,"enraged Vāli, of mighty arms, put on his clothes tightly well. Highly"
7213,SECTION XVI.,"powerful and closely habited, he, clinching his fists, proceeded towards"
7214,SECTION XVI.,"Sugriva, and waited for the action. Sugriva too, clinching his fist and"
7215,SECTION XVI.,"exceedingly wroth, proceeded towards Vāli, wearing a golden garland. And"
7216,SECTION XVI.,"beholding Sugriva, adept in warfare, having his eyes reddened with ire,"
7217,SECTION XVI.,"advance quickly, Vāli spake:—""Behold, I have clinched this terrible"
7218,SECTION XVI.,"fist, arranging close my fingers; and one blow from me will take away"
7219,SECTION XVI.,"thy life."" Being accosted thus by Vāli, Sugriva, exercised with wrath,"
7220,SECTION XVI.,"spake unto him, saying,—""This my fist shall strike thee on thy head"
7221,SECTION XVI.,"taking away thy life."" Thereupon being struck by Vāli, waxing wroth and"
7222,SECTION XVI.,approaching him quickly he began to vomit out gore like unto a mountain
7223,SECTION XVI.,"having springs. And Vāli too was struck down by Sugriva, fearlessly"
7224,SECTION XVI.,"taking up a _Sāla_ tree, like unto a mountain clapped by a thunderbolt."
7225,SECTION XVI.,Being thus smitten by the tree and overwhelmed with the strike of _Sāla_
7226,SECTION XVI.,he was troubled like unto a heavily laden boat in the midst of an ocean.
7227,SECTION XVI.,And these (two brothers) gifted with mighty strength and prowess and
7228,SECTION XVI.,"motion of _Suparna_, and having huge persons fought with each other like"
7229,SECTION XVI.,unto the Sun and Moon on the sky. They were inimical to each other and
7230,SECTION XVI.,"intent on finding their mutual dark sides. And Vāli, gifted with"
7231,SECTION XVI.,"strength and prowess, fared better in the conflict, and that highly"
7232,SECTION XVI.,"powerful son of Sun—Sugriva, was worsted. And having his pride crushed"
7233,SECTION XVI.,"down by Vāli and strength greatly reduced, Sugriva in anger pointed him"
7234,SECTION XVI.,out unto Rāma. Thereupon there took place a mighty conflict between them
7235,SECTION XVI.,"like unto _Vitra_ and _Vasava_ by means of trees with branches, hills,"
7236,SECTION XVI.,"nails, hard as thunderbolts, fists, knees, legs and arms. And these two"
7237,SECTION XVI.,"monkeys ranging in the forest, fought with each other, having their"
7238,SECTION XVI.,"persons bathed in blood, and roaring like unto clouds. And Rāghava again"
7239,SECTION XVI.,"and again beheld the weak points of that monkey chief Sugriva, losing"
7240,SECTION XVI.,his strength by and by. And beholding that chief of monkeys greatly
7241,SECTION XVI.,"distressed, the highly powerful and heroic Rāma cast his looks upon his"
7242,SECTION XVI.,"shaft, having the destruction of Vāli in view. And fixing on his bow an"
7243,SECTION XVI.,"arrow resembling a serpent, he stretched it like unto Death drawing out"
7244,SECTION XVI.,his cycle of time. Being terrified by the sound of his stringing of the
7245,SECTION XVI.,"bow the birds and beasts, dismayed as on the eve of dissolution, fled"
7246,SECTION XVI.,"away into different quarters. And a mighty shaft, like onto thunderbolt"
7247,SECTION XVI.,"and resembling flaming fire, being hurled by Rāma, alighted on the"
7248,SECTION XVI.,breast of Vāli. Being wounded by that shaft that highly powerful chief
7249,SECTION XVI.,"of monkeys, gifted with prowess fell down on the earth. Like unto"
7250,SECTION XVI.,"Sakra’s banner in the full-moon of Aswin, Vāli, with his throat choked"
7251,SECTION XVI.,"with vapor, losing all sense and sighing hard, fell dead down to the"
7252,SECTION XVI.,ground. As the great God Hara emitted forth fire with smoke from his
7253,SECTION XVI.,"mouth, so that best of men like unto Death hurled an excellent, flaming"
7254,SECTION XVI.,"and foe-destroying shaft, resembling gold and death itself. Thereupon"
7255,SECTION XVI.,"being bathed in blood that son of Vāsava, fell senseless on the ground,"
7256,SECTION XVI.,in the conflict like unto a blossoming Asoka growing on a hill and
7257,SECTION XVI.,Sakra’s banner struck down on the earth.
7258,SECTION XVI.,

7260,SECTION XVI.,
7261,SECTION XVII.,SECTION XVII.
7262,SECTION XVII.,
7263,SECTION XVII.,
7264,SECTION XVII.,"Thereupon Vāli, adept in warfare, wounded by Rāma’s shaft, fell down to"
7265,SECTION XVII.,"the ground like unto a felled tree. Ornamented with burning gold, he"
7266,SECTION XVII.,stretched the whole length of his person on the ground like unto the
7267,SECTION XVII.,"banner of the Lord of celestials, loosened and thrown (off the chariot)."
7268,SECTION XVII.,"That lord of monkeys being levelled to the ground, his kingdom appeared"
7269,SECTION XVII.,"like unto the sky, shorn of the Moon. Though struck down to the earth,"
7270,SECTION XVII.,"neither vitality, effulgence nor prowess did renounce the body of that"
7271,SECTION XVII.,high-souled one. That excellent gold and jewel-crested garland conferred
7272,SECTION XVII.,"on him by Sakra maintained the vitality, effulgence and prowess of that"
7273,SECTION XVII.,"lord of monkeys. Being adorned with that golden garland, that heroic"
7274,SECTION XVII.,"lord, of monkey-herds, appeared like unto an evening cloud. Though"
7275,SECTION XVII.,"felled to the ground, his beauty appeared as if divided into three,"
7276,SECTION XVII.,"namely, his garland, his body and the shaft piercing his heart. The"
7277,SECTION XVII.,arrow thrown off Rāma’s bow pointing out unto him the way to the
7278,SECTION XVII.,"celestial region, became an excellent means to that hero. Beholding the"
7279,SECTION XVII.,"broad-chested and mighty-armed Vāli, Mahendra’s son, wearing a golden"
7280,SECTION XVII.,"garland and having a flaming countenance and yellow eyes, thus struck"
7281,SECTION XVII.,"down to the earth, resembling a flameless fire in the field of battle,"
7282,SECTION XVII.,"like unto Yayati, slipped from the abode of the celestials on the wane"
7283,SECTION XVII.,"of his peity, like unto a tree falling down to the earth at the time of"
7284,SECTION XVII.,"Dissolution, hard to repress as Mahendra himself, incapable to withstand"
7285,SECTION XVII.,"like Upendra, Rāma, followed by Lakshmana, approached and beheld him."
7286,SECTION XVII.,And paying respects unto that hero falling on the earth like unto a
7287,SECTION XVII.,flameless fire and eying him again and again those two highly powerful
7288,SECTION XVII.,"brothers, Rāma and Lakshmana neared him. And beholding that highly"
7289,SECTION XVII.,"powerful Rāghava and Lakshmana, Vāli addressed them with the following"
7290,SECTION XVII.,"bold and pious words. And thereupon Vāli, of mitigated prowess, waning"
7291,SECTION XVII.,"vitality, motionless and stretched on the ground, spoke unto Rāma, proud"
7292,SECTION XVII.,"of warfare, saying these pregnant words.—""What merit hast thou reaped by"
7293,SECTION XVII.,"destroying me, who was not engaged in fight with thee? I was exercised"
7294,SECTION XVII.,"with ire, being engaged in conflict (with another person) and for thee I"
7295,SECTION XVII.,"have met with destruction. People speak highly of thee, O Rāma, on this"
7296,SECTION XVII.,"earth, describing thee as coming of a high family, gifted with manliness"
7297,SECTION XVII.,"and prowess, ever engaged in the welfare of thy subjects, compassionate,"
7298,SECTION XVII.,"energetic, of firm resolution and knowing time. Punishment, control of"
7299,SECTION XVII.,"passions, forgiveness, piety, firmness, truth, prowess and suppression"
7300,SECTION XVII.,of the wicked—these all are the royal virtues. And knowing thy high
7301,SECTION XVII.,"pedigree, and all these thy accomplishments I approached Sugriva with a"
7302,SECTION XVII.,"hostile intention, albeit prevented by Tārā. Before I saw thee I had"
7303,SECTION XVII.,"thought within myself:—’Forsooth Rāma shall not destroy me, engaged as I"
7304,SECTION XVII.,am with another person and hence not prepared to fight with him.’ I do
7305,SECTION XVII.,now know thee as one who hath spoliated his soul through impious
7306,SECTION XVII.,"actions, feigning religion while in truth an irreligious person,"
7307,SECTION XVII.,"resorting to all vicious deeds, like unto a well crusted with grass,"
7308,SECTION XVII.,unrighteous while passing under the cloak of honesty and religion like
7309,SECTION XVII.,unto a hidden fire. I have not done thee any wrong either in thy kingdom
7310,SECTION XVII.,or in thy city. Nor have I passed by thee. Why hast thou then destroyed
7311,SECTION XVII.,"me, who am a monkey ranging always in the woods, living on fruits and"
7312,SECTION XVII.,roots and who have come here to fight with anpther person? It appears
7313,SECTION XVII.,"that thou art of a kingly father and of a graceful countenance. And, O"
7314,SECTION XVII.,"king, there are marks of piety on thy person. Who, born in the race of"
7315,SECTION XVII.,"Kshatryas, versed in religious lore, having his doubts removed and marks"
7316,SECTION XVII.,"of peity on his person, perpetrates such an iniquitous deed? Thou art"
7317,SECTION XVII.,born in the family of Raghus and known all over the world as being
7318,SECTION XVII.,pious. Being clothed in righteousness why dost thou commit such an
7319,SECTION XVII.,"unrighteous act? Chastisement, charity, forgiveness, piety, truthfulness"
7320,SECTION XVII.,"firm- ness, prowess and the punishment of the iniquitous are the virtues"
7321,SECTION XVII.,"of a king, O prince. We are, O Rāma, wild beasts ranging in the forest"
7322,SECTION XVII.,"and living on roots and fruits—our nature is such—but thou art a man, O"
7323,SECTION XVII.,"king. Land, gold and silver are the causes of dissension. But who is"
7324,SECTION XVII.,there who is avaricious enough to get by our forest habitations and
7325,SECTION XVII.,fruits? The royal virtue consists in humbly and freely administering
7326,SECTION XVII.,"discipline, favour and punishment. Kings by no means, should follow"
7327,SECTION XVII.,"their whims. But thou art angry and unsteady by nature, capricious,"
7328,SECTION XVII.,perfectly narrow-minded in the discharge of thy royal duties and dost
7329,SECTION XVII.,use thy bow and shafts (any where and every time). Thou hast no
7330,SECTION XVII.,"attachment for virtue, no comprehension of right things and art always"
7331,SECTION XVII.,"guided by thy passions albeit thou art a lord of men. O Kākutstha,"
7332,SECTION XVII.,"destroying me sinless, with thy shaft and perpetrating such a digraceful"
7333,SECTION XVII.,"act, how shalt thou relate it unto the pious. Those, who commit treason,"
7334,SECTION XVII.,"destroy Brahmins and kine, who are theives and always engaged in the"
7335,SECTION XVII.,"destruction of animals, and who are athiests and marry before their"
7336,SECTION XVII.,"elder brothers are married, do all go to hell. The villainous, the"
7337,SECTION XVII.,"avaricious, those who kill their friends and elope with their"
7338,SECTION XVII.,"preceptor’s wives, do always visit the land of the vicious. And there is"
7339,SECTION XVII.,not the least doubt about it. My skin is npt worthy of thy touch and my
7340,SECTION XVII.,bones and hairs should always be avoided by the Virtuous. And my flesh
7341,SECTION XVII.,is not worthy of being eaten by persons of thy piety. A hedge-hog a
7342,SECTION XVII.,"porcupine, an iguana, a hare and a tortoise—these five animals only,"
7343,SECTION XVII.,"having five toes, are worthy of being eaten by the Kshatryas and"
7344,SECTION XVII.,"Brahmins, O Rāghava. The wise, O R£ma, do not touch my skin and bones"
7345,SECTION XVII.,and my flesh is not worthy of being taken—I am that (monkey) having five
7346,SECTION XVII.,toes who have been killed by thee. Alas! disregarding the well meaning
7347,SECTION XVII.,"and truthful words of Tārā, I have placed myself under the control of"
7348,SECTION XVII.,"_Kāla_ (Death). O Kākuthstha, the Earth hath got thee as her husband"
7349,SECTION XVII.,like unto a good natured damsel being wedded to a husband who hath
7350,SECTION XVII.,"forsaken his own religion. How art thou, who art wicked, narrow-minded,"
7351,SECTION XVII.,"a liar and ever intent upon bringing about others’ misfortune, born of"
7352,SECTION XVII.,the loins of the high-souled Daçaratha? I have been killed by an
7353,SECTION XVII.,"elephant—Rāma, disregarding the virtue of the pious, breaking the chord"
7354,SECTION XVII.,"of character, and neglecting the goad of religion. Perpetrating this"
7355,SECTION XVII.,"inauspicious, and improper act, blamed of the worthy what shalt thou"
7356,SECTION XVII.,speak unto the pious when thou shalt return in their company? The
7357,SECTION XVII.,"prowess, thou hast displayed towards me, careless, O Rāma thou dost"
7358,SECTION XVII.,"never employ for the suppression of the iniquitous. O son of a king,"
7359,SECTION XVII.,"hadst thou fought with me openly thou wouldst have, forsooth, seen the"
7360,SECTION XVII.,"abode of Death being killed by me. O Rāma, like unto a serpent"
7361,SECTION XVII.,"destroying persons asleep, thou, that art under the control of vice,"
7362,SECTION XVII.,"hast killed me, who am hard to repress, keeping thyself out of my sight"
7363,SECTION XVII.,"in the battle. I have been killed by thee, desirous of encompassing"
7364,SECTION XVII.,"Sugriva’s well being. Hadst thou apprized me of thy object before, I"
7365,SECTION XVII.,"would have got thee thy Maithili in the course of a day, and brought, by"
7366,SECTION XVII.,"the neck, that vicious-souled Rākshasa—Rāvana, the ravisher of thy"
7367,SECTION XVII.,spouse without putting an end to his life in the battle. Whether in the
7368,SECTION XVII.,"deep ocean or in the region under the earth, I shall bring thy Maithili"
7369,SECTION XVII.,like unto an _Ashyatari_.¹¹⁰ It is perfectly proper that Sugriva shall
7370,SECTION XVII.,inherit my kingdom on my ascension to heaven. And it is equally improper
7371,SECTION XVII.,that I have been viciously killed by thee in the battle. Every one in
7372,SECTION XVII.,time meets with death and hence there is nothing to be sorry for me. But
7373,SECTION XVII.,do thou think of a proper reply thou shalt give to the people (when
7374,SECTION XVII.,"asked about the cause of my destruction)."" Having said this, that"
7375,SECTION XVII.,"high-souled Son of monkey-chief, greatly distressed being wounded by"
7376,SECTION XVII.,"(Rāma’s) shaft and having his countenance dried up, became silent,"
7377,SECTION XVII.,"fixing his look upon Rāma, resembling the sun."
7378,SECTION XVII.,
7379,SECTION XVII.,"¹¹⁰ Here is an allusion. A prince of _Daityas_, named Hayagriva, stole"
7380,SECTION XVII.,the _Vedas_ at the end of _Kalpa_; in the recovery of them he was
7381,SECTION XVII.,slain by Vishnu after his descent as _Matshya_.—T.

7385,SECTION XVIII.,SECTION XVIII.

7387,SECTION XVIII.,
7388,SECTION XVIII.,"And thus Rāma was addressed by Vāli, wounded and senseless, with those"
7389,SECTION XVIII.,"modest, pious and auspicious words. And being thus reproached he spoke"
7390,SECTION XVIII.,"unto that excellent lord of monkeys, gifted with virtue and other"
7391,SECTION XVIII.,"accomplishments, resembling the Sun shorn of its lustre, a cloud which"
7392,SECTION XVIII.,"has already discharged its waters and fire extinguished.—""Not cognizant"
7393,SECTION XVIII.,"of virtue, knowledge, passion and custom, why dost thou blame me like a"
7394,SECTION XVIII.,"child? Why dost thou purpose to address me thus out of fickleness,"
7395,SECTION XVIII.,consequent upon thy monkeyhood not asking thy wise elders recognized by
7396,SECTION XVIII.,"the preceptors? This land, abounding in hills and woods, belongs to the"
7397,SECTION XVIII.,Ikswakus. Along with it was conferred on them the power of administering
7398,SECTION XVIII.,"favour and chastisement unto beasts, birds and human beings. The"
7399,SECTION XVIII.,"upright, virtuous and truthful king Bharata, cognizant of virtue,"
7400,SECTION XVIII.,knowledge and passion and ever engaged in adminstering favour and
7401,SECTION XVIII.,"punishment, governs this kingdom. That king is said to be cognizant of"
7402,SECTION XVIII.,"time and place; in him dwelleth modesty, truthfulness, prowess and a"
7403,SECTION XVIII.,"love for discipline. Ourselves and other kings, being commanded by him"
7404,SECTION XVIII.,"to practise piety, have been journeying in this wide world desirous of"
7405,SECTION XVIII.,"multiplying virtue. That foremost of monarchs, Bharata—lover of virtue,"
7406,SECTION XVIII.,"governing this entire earth, who dares perpetrate an iniquity? Stationed"
7407,SECTION XVIII.,in the excellent virtue of our own and placing Bharata’ s commandments
7408,SECTION XVIII.,"on our heads, we shall consider how we shall punish them who go astray"
7409,SECTION XVIII.,(from the path of virtue). Thou hast oppressed virtue and perpetrated a
7410,SECTION XVIII.,gross iniquity. Thou hast placed thyself under the control of thy
7411,SECTION XVIII.,"passions and deviated from the track of royal duties. The elder brother,"
7412,SECTION XVIII.,"father, and the instructor—these three should always be regarded in the"
7413,SECTION XVIII.,light of a father if they tread the paths of virtue and morality. A
7414,SECTION XVIII.,"younger brother, a son and an accomplished follower should always be"
7415,SECTION XVIII.,regarded as sons. And virtue is always at the bottom of all such
7416,SECTION XVIII.,"considerations. O monkey, the religion of the good is indeed very subtle"
7417,SECTION XVIII.,and can comprehend great things—the immortal soul can understand what is
7418,SECTION XVIII.,"good or bad. Fickle as thou art, how canst thou comprehend what is"
7419,SECTION XVIII.,"proper, consulting with thy monkey companions who are equally stupid and"
7420,SECTION XVIII.,"light-hearted, like unto one, born blind, leading with another such? I"
7421,SECTION XVIII.,do fairly speak unto thee that it is not anger only that has led me to
7422,SECTION XVIII.,bring about thy destruction. Do thou consider why I have killed
7423,SECTION XVIII.,thee—thou hast ravished thy brother’s wife renouncing that ever-existing
7424,SECTION XVIII.,"virtue. Thou, the perpetrator of many evil deeds, hast got by Rumā, the"
7425,SECTION XVIII.,"wife of thy brother —the high-souled Sugriva. O monkey, thou hast thus"
7426,SECTION XVIII.,violated the path of virtue. And thus I have punished thee who hast
7427,SECTION XVIII.,"ravished thy elder brother’s spouse. O thou, the leader of"
7428,SECTION XVIII.,monkey-herds—I find no other alternative than to punish him who acts
7429,SECTION XVIII.,against humanity and violates the sacred sanctions of custom. I am a
7430,SECTION XVIII.,Kshatrya coming of a high pedigree. I cannot put up with thy immoral
7431,SECTION XVIII.,conduct. _Sastras_ sanction the destruction of one who under the
7432,SECTION XVIII.,"influence of passion ravishes his own daughter, sister and younger"
7433,SECTION XVIII.,"brother’s wife. This is Bharata’s commandment—the lord of earth, and we"
7434,SECTION XVIII.,have been satisfying his orders. Thou hast disregarded virtue. A wise
7435,SECTION XVIII.,"man, living in virtue, cannot let go one who hath passed by the"
7436,SECTION XVIII.,sanctions of morality. Bharata hath sanctioned the destruction of the
7437,SECTION XVIII.,"amorous; and we, O lord of monkeys, following his orders, though proper,"
7438,SECTION XVIII.,to encompass the destruction of one like thee who hath spoliated virtue
7439,SECTION XVIII.,"and morality. Like unto Lakshmana, I have contracted friendship with"
7440,SECTION XVIII.,"Sugriva. And with a view to regain his wife and kingdom, he resolved to"
7441,SECTION XVIII.,engage in my well-being. I too also promised the same before the
7442,SECTION XVIII.,monkeys. And how can a man of my position neglect to make good his
7443,SECTION XVIII.,"promise? For these causes of very great moment, favoured by virtue, I"
7444,SECTION XVIII.,have administered unto thee this condign punishment. Do thou now approve
7445,SECTION XVIII.,it. Thy discomfiture is quite of a piece with the sanctions of morality—
7446,SECTION XVIII.,"and to assist friends is one of the codes of religion. Hear, Manu hath"
7447,SECTION XVIII.,composed a couple of couplets tending to the purification of character
7448,SECTION XVIII.,"and highly prized by the virtuous as well as myself. Those who,"
7449,SECTION XVIII.,"perpetrating iniquity, bear with fortitude the punishment, inflicted by"
7450,SECTION XVIII.,their soverign get at the abode of the celestials being purified like
7451,SECTION XVIII.,"unto the pious. People are freed from their sins, when they confessing"
7452,SECTION XVIII.,"their crimes, are either punished or forgiven. But the monarch who doth"
7453,SECTION XVIII.,"not punish the perpetrator of an evil deed, is visited by a mighty sin."
7454,SECTION XVIII.,"Formerly an iniquity, like one perpetrated by thee, was committed by a"
7455,SECTION XVIII.,devotee who was punished severely by my forefather _Māndhāta_. And other
7456,SECTION XVIII.,lords of earth punish in the same way the authors of misdeeds. What
7457,SECTION XVIII.,"more, the perpetrators of crime, themselves undergo penances and are"
7458,SECTION XVIII.,"thus released from their sins. Therefore do not repent any more, O best"
7459,SECTION XVIII.,"of monkeys. The punishment, I have inflicted on thee, is in consonance"
7460,SECTION XVIII.,"with the sanctions of morality. We are not our own masters. Hearken, O"
7461,SECTION XVIII.,"best of monkeys, there is another argument (for thy destruction); and"
7462,SECTION XVIII.,"hearing which, O great hero, it behoveth thee to renounce thy ire. Many"
7463,SECTION XVIII.,"persons living on flesh, either lying in ambush, or openly catch and"
7464,SECTION XVIII.,"pierce by means of net, noose and trap, many a deer, terrified and"
7465,SECTION XVIII.,"trusted, taking to their heels or quarrelling with their companions,"
7466,SECTION XVIII.,"careful or careless. They are not to blame in this and I do not cherish,"
7467,SECTION XVIII.,"O best of monkeys, any mortification or ire for this. And even many"
7468,SECTION XVIII.,"royal ascetics, versed in religious lore, go a-hunting; and hence thou"
7469,SECTION XVIII.,"hast been killed by me with a shaft, O monkey, in the conflict. And I am"
7470,SECTION XVIII.,"justified in killing thee, whether thou dost fight or not since thou art"
7471,SECTION XVIII.,"a monkey. There is no doubt, O best of monkeys, that the monarchs confer"
7472,SECTION XVIII.,life and piety auspicious and hard to attain. It doth not therefore
7473,SECTION XVIII.,"behove any one to injure them, to blame them and to use improper words"
7474,SECTION XVIII.,by them—since they are the celestials ranging on this earth under the
7475,SECTION XVIII.,semblance of man. Not knowing virtue and growing angry why dost thou
7476,SECTION XVIII.,"blame me who am following the religion of my forefathers?"" Being thus"
7477,SECTION XVIII.,"accosted by Rāma, Vāli, greatly mortified and informed of the principle"
7478,SECTION XVIII.,"of religion, observed no delinquency in Rāghava. Thereupon that lord of"
7479,SECTION XVIII.,"monkeys spake unto Rāma, with folded hands, saying ""There is not the"
7480,SECTION XVIII.,"least doubt, O best of men, in all that thou hast said. An inferior"
7481,SECTION XVIII.,person can by no means address his superior improperly. It doth not
7482,SECTION XVIII.,"behove thee, O Rāghava, therefore to blame me for those unpleasant words"
7483,SECTION XVIII.,"which I used towards thee, out of foolishness. Thou hast acquired a"
7484,SECTION XVIII.,practical mastery over the principles of religion and art ever engaged
7485,SECTION XVIII.,in the welfare of thy subjects. Thy eternal power of ascertaining the
7486,SECTION XVIII.,crime and meeting its condign punishment is perfectly clear. Do thou
7487,SECTION XVIII.,know me as the foremost of sinners and one who hath deviated from the
7488,SECTION XVIII.,"track of morality. Do thou conduct me, with pious words, to a better"
7489,SECTION XVIII.,"land."" Vāli, having his throat choked with vapour, addressed again and"
7490,SECTION XVIII.,"again, Rāma, with piteous accents, saying:—""I do not mourn so much for"
7491,SECTION XVIII.,"me, Tārā, or other friends as for my son Angada, eldest and wearing a"
7492,SECTION XVIII.,"golden _Angada._¹¹¹ Brought up by me from his very infancy, he shall by"
7493,SECTION XVIII.,"my separation, wear away like unto a pond having its liquid contents"
7494,SECTION XVIII.,"drunk up by an elephant. He is my only son, dear and born of Tārā. A"
7495,SECTION XVIII.,"mere child and of unripe understanding as he is, that one of mighty"
7496,SECTION XVIII.,"strength should always be protected by thee, O Rāma. Do thou regard"
7497,SECTION XVIII.,"favourably Sugriva and Angada. Thou art their protector, and chastiser"
7498,SECTION XVIII.,"punishing them for their sins. O king, O lord of men, it behoveth thee"
7499,SECTION XVIII.,to regard Sugriva and Angada in the same light in which thou regardest
7500,SECTION XVIII.,Bharata and Lakshmana. It behoveth thee to so arrange as Sugriva may not
7501,SECTION XVIII.,"disregard that chaste Tārā who is blameable for my folly only. He, who"
7502,SECTION XVIII.,"is favoured by thee, abideth by thy commandments and acteth after thy"
7503,SECTION XVIII.,"heart, can acquire kingdom, attain to heaven, and govern the earth."
7504,SECTION XVIII.,"Desiring to have my destruction brought about by thee, I entered into"
7505,SECTION XVIII.,"conflict with my brother Sugriva, albeit prevented by Tārā."" Having"
7506,SECTION XVIII.,"addressed Rāma thus, the lord of monkeys stopped. Thereupon Rāma"
7507,SECTION XVIII.,"consoled Vāli, of clear understanding with the following moral words,"
7508,SECTION XVIII.,"acceptable unto the Saints. ""O best of monkeys, do thou not consider"
7509,SECTION XVIII.,"ourselves as well as thyself blameable. We are more conversant, than"
7510,SECTION XVIII.,"thou, with the principles of religion. They never lose their virtue"
7511,SECTION XVIII.,being proficient in the mode of ascerting crime and punishing it—one
7512,SECTION XVIII.,administering punishment unto the criminal and the criminal receiving
7513,SECTION XVIII.,it. And therefore receiving punishment (from me) thou hast been released
7514,SECTION XVIII.,from thy sins and acquired a knowledge of religion. Do thou therefore
7515,SECTION XVIII.,"renounce thy grief, thy illusion and the fear that is lurking in thy"
7516,SECTION XVIII.,"heart. It is impossible for thee, O foremost of monkeys, to withstand"
7517,SECTION XVIII.,"the course of dispensation. There is not the least doubt, O lord of"
7518,SECTION XVIII.,"monkeys, that Angada shall be brought up by me and Sugriva in the same"
7519,SECTION XVIII.,"way as he was by thee."" Hearing these sweet, collected and pious words"
7520,SECTION XVIII.,"of the high-souled Rāma,—the represser of the enemies in a battle,—the"
7521,SECTION XVIII.,"monkey again addressed him with the following pregnant words—""O lord, O"
7522,SECTION XVIII.,"thou having Mahendra’s prowess, I do propitiate thee for my having"
7523,SECTION XVIII.,"insulted thee with improper words, senseless as I was being wounded by"
7524,SECTION XVIII.,"shafts. Do thou forgive me, O lord of monkeys."""

7532,SECTION XIX.,
7533,SECTION XIX.,"Being thus accosted with reasonable words, that lord, of monkeys, lying"
7534,SECTION XIX.,"on the ground and wounded with shafts, gave no reply. Having his limbs"
7535,SECTION XIX.,"dissevered by stones, being struck with trees and wounded by Rāma’s"
7536,SECTION XIX.,"shaft, he became sensetess at the approach of death. His spouse Tārā"
7537,SECTION XIX.,"heard that Vāli, the foremost of monkeys, had been killed in the"
7538,SECTION XIX.,conflict by Rāma’s shaft. Hearing the heart-rending news of her
7539,SECTION XIX.,"husband’s demise, she, big with a child, issued out of the mountain cave"
7540,SECTION XIX.,"with a troubled heart. And beholding Rāma with a bow in his hand, the"
7541,SECTION XIX.,"mighty monkeys, followers of Angada, fled away, terrified. Thereupon"
7542,SECTION XIX.,Tārā observed those monkeys flying away terrified like unto deer
7543,SECTION XIX.,"alienated from their herd, having lost their king. And the chaste lady,"
7544,SECTION XIX.,"racked with sorrow, spoke unto those monkeys, afraid of Rāma, wounded"
7545,SECTION XIX.,"with shafts and exercised with grief, saying:—""O monkeys, why are ye"
7546,SECTION XIX.,"dying away, terrified and distressed, leaving behind that foremost of"
7547,SECTION XIX.,"kings before whom ye were used to fight? Hath Vāli been killed by Rāma,"
7548,SECTION XIX.,"waiting at a distance with fleet and distant coursing shafts, being"
7549,SECTION XIX.,"requested by Sugriva for kingdom?"" Hearing the words of that wife of the"
7550,SECTION XIX.,"monkey, they, wearing shapes at will, addressed that damsel with words,"
7551,SECTION XIX.,"worthy of being said on that occasion,—""O thou, having thy son alive, do"
7552,SECTION XIX.,"thou go back and bring up thy son Angada. Death himself, under Rāma’s"
7553,SECTION XIX.,"semblance, hath snatched away Vāli. He was killed by (Rāma’s) shafts,"
7554,SECTION XIX.,"resembling thunderbolts, as if clapped by thunder itself, having bored"
7555,SECTION XIX.,"trees and big stones (hurled by Vāli). That king of monkeys, having"
7556,SECTION XIX.,"Sakra’s prowess, being made away with, this host of monkeys have been"
7557,SECTION XIX.,taking to their heels being overwhelmed with consternation. Let the
7558,SECTION XIX.,heroes defend the city and install Angada on the throne. And on his
7559,SECTION XIX.,being installed the monkeys shall serve Vāli’s son. O thou having a fine
7560,SECTION XIX.,"countenance, the monkeys shall enter this stronghold, although it is a"
7561,SECTION XIX.,"favourite place with thee. Herein dwell many forest-rangers, wifeless"
7562,SECTION XIX.,"and having wives. And we are really afraid of them, avaricious, and"
7563,SECTION XIX.,"formerly deprived of their wealth by us."" Hearing those words of the"
7564,SECTION XIX.,"monkeys, lying at a little distance, that lady, smiling sweet, spoke"
7565,SECTION XIX.,"unto them, words worthy of herself—""That great lord of monkeys, my"
7566,SECTION XIX.,"husband, being dead, what shall I do with my son, my kingdom and myself?"
7567,SECTION XIX.,"I shall place myself at the feet of that high-souled one, who hath been"
7568,SECTION XIX.,"killed by Rāma’s shaft."" Having said this, (Tārā) proceeded, overwhelmed"
7569,SECTION XIX.,"with grief, weeping and striking her bead with her hands. While"
7570,SECTION XIX.,"proceeding, she espied her husband lying on the ground like unto the"
7571,SECTION XIX.,destroyer of the lords of monkeys who have never been discomfitted in a
7572,SECTION XIX.,"battle field, hurling mountains like unto Vāsava hurling thunderbolts;"
7573,SECTION XIX.,emitting a roar like unto a big cloud assisted by a mighty wind;
7574,SECTION XIX.,resembling Sakra in prowess and like unto a cloud accompanied by rain;
7575,SECTION XIX.,the represser of repressers; a mighty hero discomfitted by an equally
7576,SECTION XIX.,powerful one; like unto a lion killed by a tiger for flesh; worshipped
7577,SECTION XIX.,"of all mem; like unto a _chaitya,_¹¹² adorned with pennons and altars,"
7578,SECTION XIX.,scattered and broken by Garuda with a view to kill serpents. And she
7579,SECTION XIX.,"espied Rāma reclining his person on a mighty bow, his younger brother"
7580,SECTION XIX.,and her husband’s younger brother. Passing them by and getting at her
7581,SECTION XIX.,"husband and beholding him killed in battle, she, losing her senses fell"

7609,SECTION XX.,beholding thee on the ground it hath not been sundered into thousand
7610,SECTION XX.,pieces being overwhelmed with grief. Sugriva’s wife was carried away and
7611,SECTION XX.,"banished by thee and this is the result of thy action, O foremost of"

7619,SECTION XX.,"person, and perpetrating such an iniquitous deed, Kākuthstha doth never"
7620,SECTION XX.,"relent. Unused to miseries before how shall I, being an object"

7622,SECTION XX.,"How shall the heroic and youthful Angada, brought up in luxury and"
7623,SECTION XX.,"happiness, be regarded by his uncle, senseless with wrath? Do thou cast"
7624,SECTION XX.,"for good, O my son, thy looks towards thy pious sire, for since now it"

7685,SECTION XXI.,respect) not mother. There is no other resource for me tending to my
7686,SECTION XXI.,welfare both in this world and the next than taking refuge onto this

7698,SECTION XXII.,"affectionately saying:—""O Sugriva, do thou not take to thy heart the"
7699,SECTION XXII.,"improper conduct I have shown towards thee, being attracted by"
7700,SECTION XXII.,"inevitable foolishness, subject as I was to sin. Methinks, O brother, it"
7701,SECTION XXII.,is not our fortune to enjoy at the same time the double bliss of
7702,SECTION XXII.,"fraternal affection and the enjoyment of kingdom, or else why has it"
7703,SECTION XXII.,happened otherwise? Do thou acquire to-day this kingdom of the
7704,SECTION XXII.,forest-ranges and know me as one who hath departed to the abode of
7705,SECTION XXII.,"Death. Soon shall I renounce my life, kingdom, my exquisite grace and my"
7706,SECTION XXII.,"blameless fame. It behoveth thee, O hero, O king, to perform what I"
7707,SECTION XXII.,"shall speak unto thee in this plight, however difficult it might be. Do"
7708,SECTION XXII.,thou behold Angada fallen on the ground with tears in his eyes—a little
7709,SECTION XXII.,"boy, incapable, brought up in luxury and deserving happiness. Do thou"
7710,SECTION XXII.,"maintain this my son, dearer than my life, like unto thy own son, born"
7711,SECTION XXII.,"of thy loins, satisfying all his wants in my absence. O best of monkeys,"
7712,SECTION XXII.,"like unto me, thou art his father, protector, conferrer of gifts and"
7713,SECTION XXII.,remover of fear. This graceful son of Tārā equals thee in prowess and
7714,SECTION XXII.,shall precede thee in the destruction of Rākshasas. This youthful
7715,SECTION XXII.,"Angada, Tārā’s son, gifted with energy and strength, shall perform"
7716,SECTION XXII.,befitting exploits displaying his prowess in the battle. Surasen’s
7717,SECTION XXII.,daughter is wonderfully expert in ascertaining subtle things and giving
7718,SECTION XXII.,"counsels in the time of danger. Do thou, without the least doubt perform"
7719,SECTION XXII.,what shall the chaste lady instruct thee to do; for Tārā’s advice never
7720,SECTION XXII.,goes without effect. It behoveth thee to perform Rāghava’s service
7721,SECTION XXII.,fearlessly or else thou shalt be visited with sin: on his being insulted
7722,SECTION XXII.,"thou shalt be injured. O Sugriva, do thou put on this celestial golden"
7723,SECTION XXII.,garland—herein dwelleth the bounteous Sree who shall renounce me after
7724,SECTION XXII.,"my death."" Having been accosted thus by Vāli, out of fraternal"
7725,SECTION XXII.,"affection, Sugriva renouncing joy again became pale like unto the Moon"
7726,SECTION XXII.,"possessed by Rāhu. Renouncing his inimical feelings, being thus"
7727,SECTION XXII.,addressed by Vāli and carrying out his words energetically Sugriva
7728,SECTION XXII.,accepted the golden garland as ordered (by him). And conferring (upon
7729,SECTION XXII.,"Sugriva) that golden garland and beholding his son before him, Vāli,"
7730,SECTION XXII.,"resolved upon death, spake unto Angada, saying:—""Do thou place thyself"
7731,SECTION XXII.,"now under the control of Sugriva, ascertaining time and place, putting"
7732,SECTION XXII.,"up with misery for thy welfare and injury. O thou having long arms,"
7733,SECTION XXII.,"Sugriva shall not regard thee much, if dost thou remain in the same wise"
7734,SECTION XXII.,"in which thou hadst been brought up by me before.¹¹³ O slayer of foes,"
7735,SECTION XXII.,"do thou never mix with Sugriva’s enemies, and place thyself always under"
7736,SECTION XXII.,"Sugriva’s control, having subdued thy senses and being intent upon thy"
7737,SECTION XXII.,master’s (Sugriva’s) welfare. Do thou not cultivate too much of
7738,SECTION XXII.,friendship nor be wanting in it—for both of these extremes are sources
7739,SECTION XXII.,"of disasters. Do thou therefore follow the golden mean."" After he had"
7740,SECTION XXII.,"said this, his eyes became expanded, his teeth were opened and his"
7741,SECTION XXII.,appearance became ghastly. And greatly pained by shafts he breathed his
7742,SECTION XXII.,"last. And thereupon, the monkeys, the foremost of those who go jumping,"
7743,SECTION XXII.,"having lost their chief, bewailed and cried. On that monkey chiefs"
7744,SECTION XXII.,"departure to the land of celestials, Kishkindhā was divested of her"
7745,SECTION XXII.,"lord, and gardens, hills and woods were all rendered lonely. That best"
7746,SECTION XXII.,"of monkeys, who fought a dreadful battle with the high-souled"

7760,SECTION XXII.,¹¹³ The significance of the passage is as follows:—Thou wert a mere

7771,SECTION XXIII.,"addressed her deceased lord, known all over the world, saying:—""O hero,"
7772,SECTION XXIII.,"disregarding my words, thou art lying on the uneven earth, hard and"
7773,SECTION XXIII.,"filled with gravels. O lord of monkeys, the earth is dearer unto thee"
7774,SECTION XXIII.,"than I, since thou art lying there embracing her and art not welcoming"
7775,SECTION XXIII.,"me. O hero, O dear, O brave lord, wonder it is that God under the"
7776,SECTION XXIII.,"semblance of Rāma, hath placed himself under the control of Sugriva;"
7777,SECTION XXIII.,"hithertofore he shall be regarded as a hero. Why art thou not awake,"
7778,SECTION XXIII.,"hearing the bewailings of bears and monkeys who used to wait upon thee,"
7779,SECTION XXIII.,"powerful, as well as that of Angada and myself? Alas! thou art lying on"
7780,SECTION XXIII.,"this bed of the heroes, being slain in the battle, where formerly, thy"
7781,SECTION XXIII.,"enemies destroyed by thee, used to lie down. thou born of a pure family,"
7782,SECTION XXIII.,"O thou that art fond of warfare, O my dear, O conferror of honors,"
7783,SECTION XXIII.,"whither hast thou departed making me husbandless? Let not the wise,"
7784,SECTION XXIII.,"henceforth, confer their daughters upon the heroes. Alas! behold me, the"
7785,SECTION XXIII.,"wife of a hero, made a widow in no time. Shattered is my honor and"
7786,SECTION XXIII.,destroyed is my happiness and I am sunk in the deep abyss of grief.
7787,SECTION XXIII.,"Forsooth, this my firm heart is not sundered into hundred pieces,"
7788,SECTION XXIII.,"beholding my husband slain! Thou art my friend, my dear husband and a"
7789,SECTION XXIII.,"great hero—and thou hast met with destruction, being struck by another"
7790,SECTION XXIII.,"man. A husbandless woman is always styled by the wise as widow, although"
7791,SECTION XXIII.,"she might have a son and enough of riches. O hero, thou art lying down"
7792,SECTION XXIII.,"in a pool of blood issuing out of thy own person, like unto thy own bed"
7793,SECTION XXIII.,having a red-dyed bed-sheet. Thy body is on all sides besmeared with
7794,SECTION XXIII.,"blood and dust and I am incapable of embracing thee with my arms, O best"
7795,SECTION XXIII.,"of monkeys. Surely hath Sugriva satisfied his hostile intention to-day,"
7796,SECTION XXIII.,"whose fear hath been removed by one shaft, discharged by Rāma. Thyself"
7797,SECTION XXIII.,"departing to the land of the dead, I have been eying thee simply, being"
7798,SECTION XXIII.,"prevented from touching thy person by the shaft piercing thy heart"".¹¹⁴"
7799,SECTION XXIII.,Thereupon Neela took out that shaft from the person of (Vāli) like unto
7800,SECTION XXIII.,a flaming serpent lurking in a mountain cave. There beamed the shaft
7801,SECTION XXIII.,"extracted from his body like unto the rays of the Sun, stationed on the"
7802,SECTION XXIII.,"summit of the setting hill. And there poured forth from all his wounds,"
7803,SECTION XXIII.,"streams of blood, like unto showers of melted copper and other metals"
7804,SECTION XXIII.,"falling from a mountain. And (Tārā) washed, with tears, her heroic"
7805,SECTION XXIII.,husband’s body covered with dust and wounded with weapons. Beholding her
7806,SECTION XXIII.,"husband thus slain and besmeared with blood, she spake unto her son,"
7807,SECTION XXIII.,"Angada, having coppery eyes,saying:—""Behold this terrible declining"
7808,SECTION XXIII.,stage of thy Sire. Here is the end of his hostilities collected by his
7809,SECTION XXIII.,"impious actions. O my son, do thou bow unto thy kingly father, the"
7810,SECTION XXIII.,"conferrer of honors, who hath departed to the abode of Death, having a"
7811,SECTION XXIII.,"flaming person like unto the rising Sun."" Thus accosted, Angada rose up"
7812,SECTION XXIII.,"and, saying, ""I (do touch my Sire’s feet),"" embraced his father’s feet"
7813,SECTION XXIII.,"with his plump arms. (Thereupon Tārā said)—""Saying ’Do thou live long’"
7814,SECTION XXIII.,"why dost thou not welcome Angada, to-day as before, who hath bowed unto"
7815,SECTION XXIII.,"thee? I am with my son, standing by thee who art dead, like unto a cow"
7816,SECTION XXIII.,"with her calf, having the bull slain by a lion. How hast thou, without"
7817,SECTION XXIII.,"me, thy wife, bathed in the water of Rāma’s shafts, at the end of thy"
7818,SECTION XXIII.,battle-like sacrifice? Why do I not behold here that favourite golden
7819,SECTION XXIII.,"garland of thine, which was conferred on thee by the lord of celestials,"
7820,SECTION XXIII.,"pleased in a battle? Royal grace hath not renounced thee, O conferrer of"
7821,SECTION XXIII.,"honors, albeit thou art dead, like unto the rays not quitting the king"
7822,SECTION XXIII.,"of mountains, even after the Sun is set. Thou didst not act by my"
7823,SECTION XXIII.,"wholesome words, nor could I prevent thee. And I am now destroyed with"
7824,SECTION XXIII.,"my son, along with thee in the battle. Truly hath Sree (goddess of"
7825,SECTION XXIII.,"wealth) renounced me."""

7835,SECTION XXIV.,"Beholding Tārā emerged in a deep and mighty ocean of grief, Vāli’s"
7836,SECTION XXIV.,"younger brother was overwhelmed with penitence, in consequence of the"
7837,SECTION XXIV.,unbecoming destruction of his brother. And seeing her countenance full
7838,SECTION XXIV.,"of tears, the high-souled (Sugriva), racked with grief and repentance,"
7839,SECTION XXIV.,"approached slowly Rāma along with his followers. And nearing him, with a"
7840,SECTION XXIV.,"bow in his hand, having arrows like unto serpents, famed and having"
7841,SECTION XXIV.,"auspicious marks on his person, he spake unto Rāghava, seated there,"
7842,SECTION XXIV.,"saying—""O lord of men, thou hast fulfilled thy promise by carrying it"
7843,SECTION XXIV.,"out into practice; and as for wretched me, O son of a king, I shall"
7844,SECTION XXIV.,"refrain today from all enjoyments. This queen lamenting piteously, these"
7845,SECTION XXIV.,"subjects and retinue bewailing, being overwhelmed with grief, this king"
7846,SECTION XXIV.,"being slain, how can kingdom please me? O Rāma out of anger, and"
7847,SECTION XXIV.,"passion, and on account of my being insulted by him, I did formerly"
7848,SECTION XXIV.,desire to bring about my brother’s destruction. But that lord of
7849,SECTION XXIV.,"monkey-herds being slain, best of Ikshwākus, I am truly pierced to the"
7850,SECTION XXIV.,"quick with anguish. I do prefer living for good in the mount Rishyamuka,"
7851,SECTION XXIV.,"earning my livelihood somehow or other, to the accession of heaven by"
7852,SECTION XXIV.,destroying (Vāli). This highly intellectual and high-souled one spake
7853,SECTION XXIV.,"unto me ""Do thou range at large, I do not wish to destroy thee."" Such"
7854,SECTION XXIV.,"words were really becoming of him, O Rāma. And these words and this"
7855,SECTION XXIV.,"action become me (vile as I am). How can a brother, O Rāma, however"
7856,SECTION XXIV.,"avaricious he night be, relish the destruction of his qualified brother,"
7857,SECTION XXIV.,"comparing the happiness of a kingdom, with the grief (consequent upon"
7858,SECTION XXIV.,"his brother’s demise)? He did not desire to slay me, lest his greatness"
7859,SECTION XXIV.,"might be spoiled; but alas! through my wicked sense, I performed an"
7860,SECTION XXIV.,iniquity by taking the life of my brother. Being struck by him with
7861,SECTION XXIV.,"branches of trees, while I fled away and wept, he, consoling me, said"
7862,SECTION XXIV.,"only ""Do not do this again. "" He all along maintained his fraternal"
7863,SECTION XXIV.,"feelings, his honesty and piety; but (woe to me) I have displayed my"
7864,SECTION XXIV.,"wrath, passion and monkey-hood. O friend, like unto the lord of"
7865,SECTION XXIV.,"celestials perpetrating sin by destroying Biswarupa, I have been, by"
7866,SECTION XXIV.,"bringing about the destruction of my brother, visited with this sin,"
7867,SECTION XXIV.,"beyond comprehension, avoidable, undesirable and invisible. Indra’s sin"
7868,SECTION XXIV.,"was shared by earth; water, trees and women; but who is there who will"
7869,SECTION XXIV.,bear and desire to participate this monkey’s sin? Perpetrating such an
7870,SECTION XXIV.,"improper and irreligious act, tending to the decay of my family, I do"
7871,SECTION XXIV.,not deserve the respect of my subjects and the heir-apparentship; what
7872,SECTION XXIV.,"of kingdom, O Rāghava. I am the perpetrator of a vile and disgraceful"
7873,SECTION XXIV.,"sin, blamed of all in this world. And like unto a current of rain going"
7874,SECTION XXIV.,"downwards, this mighty grief hath overcome me. This mighty and"
7875,SECTION XXIV.,"infuriated elephant of a sin, having the destruction of a brother as its"
7876,SECTION XXIV.,"body, repentence, as its trunk, head, eyes and tusks, hath been crushing"
7877,SECTION XXIV.,"me like unto the banks of a river. Alas! O best of kings, this"
7878,SECTION XXIV.,unbearable sin hath been driving away all pious feelings from my heart
7879,SECTION XXIV.,"like unto alloy leaking out of discolored gold when molten in fire, O"
7880,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāghava. Methinks, for me, O Rāghava, these mighty monkeys and Angada"
7881,SECTION XXIV.,are almost half-dead (with grief). A good-natured and obedient son is
7882,SECTION XXIV.,"rare. Where is to be found Angada’s equal? O hero, there is no such land"
7883,SECTION XXIV.,where I may meet again my brother. The heroic Angada shall not live
7884,SECTION XXIV.,"to-day—and if he lives, his mother shall live to bring him up. Forsooth,"
7885,SECTION XXIV.,"without her son, she shall not live long. Therefore shall I enter this"
7886,SECTION XXIV.,flaming fire with a view to place myself on the same level with my
7887,SECTION XXIV.,brother and his son and all these mighty monkeys shall engage in quest
7888,SECTION XXIV.,"of Sitā, abiding by thy commandments. O son of a king, they shall all"
7889,SECTION XXIV.,"carry out thy orders even in my absence, do thou,therefore, order me (to"
7890,SECTION XXIV.,"enter fire) who am the destroyer of my own race, have performed an"
7891,SECTION XXIV.,"inquity and do not deserve living any more."" Hearing the words of Vāli’s"
7892,SECTION XXIV.,"younger brother, who was bewailing thus, Rāma, the heroic descendant of"
7893,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāghu and the slayer of foes, remained stupified for some time with"
7894,SECTION XXIV.,"tears in his eyes. In the mean-time, Rāma, patient like unto the"
7895,SECTION XXIV.,"protector of the world, worked with curiosity, looked again and again"
7896,SECTION XXIV.,towards the bewailing Tārā sunk in the gulf of disaster. Thereupon the
7897,SECTION XXIV.,"principal counsellors raised up the brave spouse of the lord of monkeys,"
7898,SECTION XXIV.,"having graceful eyes and lying ou the earth, embracing her husband. And"
7899,SECTION XXIV.,"snatched away from her husband and trembling, she beheld Rāma, with bow"
7900,SECTION XXIV.,"and arrows in his hand, burning like unto the Sun by virtue of his own"
7901,SECTION XXIV.,"effulgence. And beholding him gifted with all royal marks, having"
7902,SECTION XXIV.,"beautiful eyes and never seen before, that one, having the eyes of a"
7903,SECTION XXIV.,"fawn, thought within herself. ""This great one must be Kākuthstha."" And"
7904,SECTION XXIV.,"the worshipful Tārā, worked with grief, and overwhelmed with disasters,"
7905,SECTION XXIV.,"bewailing, neared quickly that high-souled one, resembling the lord of"
7906,SECTION XXIV.,celestials and hard to approach. And having reached the pure-souled
7907,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāma, who had his ends fully attained in battle, the high-minded Tārā,"
7908,SECTION XXIV.,"having her frame worked with grief, spake unto him, saying:—""Thou art"
7909,SECTION XXIV.,"immeasurable, hard to approach, highly pious, prudent, of controlled"
7910,SECTION XXIV.,"senses and increasing fame, forgiving like unto earth and of blood-red"
7911,SECTION XXIV.,"eyes. Thou hast bow and arrows in hand, art highly powerful and of a"
7912,SECTION XXIV.,tough body. And renouncing human grace that hast assumed the grace of a
7913,SECTION XXIV.,celestial person. Do thou slay me with that self-same shaft with which
7914,SECTION XXIV.,"my dear one was slain. And thus slain, O hero, I shall be near him, for"
7915,SECTION XXIV.,Vālii doth not relish the company of any other woman but me. O thou
7916,SECTION XXIV.,"having eyes resembling clean lotus-petals, this (hero) departing to the"
7917,SECTION XXIV.,"abode of celestials and not beholding me there, shall not delight in the"
7918,SECTION XXIV.,"company of _Apsarās_, wearing diversified garments and copper-colored"
7919,SECTION XXIV.,"corronets. Even in the land of celestials, O hero, Vāli shall turn pale"
7920,SECTION XXIV.,"with grief in my separation, like unto thee in the picuresque dale of"
7921,SECTION XXIV.,"the Lord of mountains, separated from the daughter of the king of"
7922,SECTION XXIV.,Videha. Thou knowest well that a handsome man is greatly afflicted with
7923,SECTION XXIV.,"the separation of his spouse; and knowing this, do thou slay me, and"
7924,SECTION XXIV.,Vāli shall not be tormented with grief consequent upon my absence.
7925,SECTION XXIV.,"High-souled as thou art, thou art thinking that thou shalt, slaying me,"
7926,SECTION XXIV.,be visited with a sin arising from the destruction of a female. But do
7927,SECTION XXIV.,"thou kill me, O son of a king, knowing me as the soul of Vāli, and thou"
7928,SECTION XXIV.,shalt not be responsible for destroying a woman. According to the Vedas
7929,SECTION XXIV.,"and various other sacred texts, wives are inseparably blended with their"
7930,SECTION XXIV.,husbands. And the wise say that there is no other gift better than that
7931,SECTION XXIV.,"of a wife in this world. Thou shalt, O hero, confer me religiously upon"
7932,SECTION XXIV.,my dear one and by this gift thou shalt be saved from the sin consequent
7933,SECTION XXIV.,"upon killing me. It doth not behove thee not to kill me, who am"
7934,SECTION XXIV.,"exercised with grief, without my lord, snatched away from him and"
7935,SECTION XXIV.,"reduced to such a (pitiable) plight. O lord of men, I cannot live long"
7936,SECTION XXIV.,"without that highly intelligent lord of monkeys, having an elephantine"
7937,SECTION XXIV.,"gait and wearing an excellent golden garland."" Thus accosted, the"
7938,SECTION XXIV.,"high-souled lord consoling Tārā, spake unto her the following"
7939,SECTION XXIV.,"well-meaning words.—""Do thou not lose thyself, O wife of a hero. This"
7940,SECTION XXIV.,whole world of creation is being guided by God’s dispensation. And by
7941,SECTION XXIV.,Him is administered misery or happiness as people say. These three
7942,SECTION XXIV.,worlds cannot neglect His dispensations and are entirely subject to Him.
7943,SECTION XXIV.,Thy son shall attain to the heir apparentship of the throne and thou
7944,SECTION XXIV.,shalt enjoy excellent joy therefrom. This hath been decreed by the
7945,SECTION XXIV.,"Almighty. Wives of heroes do never relent."" Being thus consoled by the"
7946,SECTION XXIV.,"high-souled (Rāma) gifted with prowess, and the slayer of foes, Tārā,"
7947,SECTION XXIV.,"the wife of a heroic husband, and wearing a graceful garment, ceased"
7948,SECTION XXIV.,bewailing.

7952,SECTION XXV.,SECTION XXV.

7954,SECTION XXV.,
7955,SECTION XXV.,"Thereupon, Kākutstha, with Lakshmana, equally aggrieved, said, consoling"
7956,SECTION XXV.,"Sugriva, and Tārā together with Angada.—""Grief and lamentations do not"
7957,SECTION XXV.,tend to the welfare of the deceased. It therefore behoveth ye to perform
7958,SECTION XXV.,the after ceremonies. Ye have satisfied the worldly practice with a
7959,SECTION XXV.,profuse discharge of tears. It is not proper to delay the performance of
7960,SECTION XXV.,"appointed actions. Time is the prime cause in this world, and the source"
7961,SECTION XXV.,of the accomplishment of actions. And Time it is that leads men to
7962,SECTION XXV.,"actions. No one is the lord of another person, and no one leads him to"
7963,SECTION XXV.,actions. People are subject to their actions of previous existence and
7964,SECTION XXV.,Time aids them. Even the Eternal being cannot withstand the ways of
7965,SECTION XXV.,Time. He never decayeth and no one else can withstand the course of
7966,SECTION XXV.,"Time. It hath no friend, no cause and no one can overcome it. It hath no"
7967,SECTION XXV.,"kinsman, no relation; even it is not subject to itself. The wise can"
7968,SECTION XXV.,"percieve the work of Time. Piety, wealth and desire are all subject to"
7969,SECTION XXV.,"it. Vāli, the lord of monkeys, hath attained to his own true state,"
7970,SECTION XXV.,"reaping the fruits of his actions, acquired by virtue of his royal"
7971,SECTION XXV.,"accomplishments —namely, forgiveness and charity. The abode of the"
7972,SECTION XXV.,"celestials, which was conquered by this high-souled one by his former"
7973,SECTION XXV.,"piety, hath now been occupied by him after resigning his body. This is"
7974,SECTION XXV.,the best course of Time that hath been attained to by the lord of
7975,SECTION XXV.,monkey-herds. No more with lamentations therefore; do thou perform the
7976,SECTION XXV.,"actions that are worthy of being performed on this occasion."" After Rāma"
7977,SECTION XXV.,"had spoken thus, Lakshmana, the slayer of foes, addressed Sugriva,"
7978,SECTION XXV.,"senseless with grief, with the following sound words:—""Sugrivā, do thou"
7979,SECTION XXV.,perform the funeral ceremonies of Vāli along with Tārā and Angada. Do
7980,SECTION XXV.,thou collect for cremation many a dry fuel and celestial sandal. Do thou
7981,SECTION XXV.,"console the unfortunate Angada, who is beside himself with grief. Do not"
7982,SECTION XXV.,"conduct thyself like an ignorant person, for this city is now under"
7983,SECTION XXV.,"thee. Let Angada bring clothes, garlands, scents, clarified butter, oil"
7984,SECTION XXV.,"and other necessary articles. O Tārā, do thou go and bring soon a"
7985,SECTION XXV.,conveyance; for speediness is a special virtue on an occasion like this.
7986,SECTION XXV.,Let the monkeys dress themselves who can convey this hearse. The
7987,SECTION XXV.,"powerful and the capable only shall carry Vāli"". Having thus addressed"
7988,SECTION XXV.,"Sugriva, Lakshmana, the enhancer of Sumitra’s joy and the destroyer of"
7989,SECTION XXV.,"foes, stood before his elder brother. And hearing the words of"
7990,SECTION XXV.,"Lakshmana, the counsellor respectfully entered the cave with a view to"
7991,SECTION XXV.,bring the conveyance. And taking that conveyance carried by the monkeys
7992,SECTION XXV.,"and worthy of being carried by the heroes, he issued out again of the"
7993,SECTION XXV.,cave. It had a celestial throne and was like unto a war-chariot and had
7994,SECTION XXV.,trees and birds painted on it. It was painted on all sides with the
7995,SECTION XXV.,"figures of foot soldiers, had latticed windows and was like unto the car"
7996,SECTION XXV.,of the _Siddhas_—spacious and artistically and stoutly built by artizans
7997,SECTION XXV.,with beautiful carvings like unto a wooden hill. It was ornamented with
7998,SECTION XXV.,"excellent ornaments and beautiful garlands, sprinkled with red sandal"
7999,SECTION XXV.,and skirted with strong ribs. It was covered with flowers and
8000,SECTION XXV.,"lotus-garlands, crusted with precious clothes and had the colour of the"
8001,SECTION XXV.,"rising Sun. Beholding such a conveyance, Rāma spake unto Lakshmana,"
8002,SECTION XXV.,"saying—""Do thou soon conduct the funeral service of Vāli."" Thereupon"
8003,SECTION XXV.,"Sugriva, along with Angada, placing Vāli on the conveyance, began to"
8004,SECTION XXV.,bewail.
8005,SECTION XXV.,
8006,SECTION XXV.,"And placing the lifeless body of Vāli on it, he covered it with various"
8007,SECTION XXV.,"ornaments, garlands, and clothes. Thereat Sugrira, the king of monkeys,"
8008,SECTION XXV.,"ordered for the performance of Vāli’s funeral rites. ""Let the monkeys go"
8009,SECTION XXV.,"before, scattering many a precious jewel and let the conveyance follow"
8010,SECTION XXV.,them. Let the monkeys perform the obsequies of our master with such
8011,SECTION XXV.,"grandeur as befits the riches of the kings on this earth."" With a view"
8012,SECTION XXV.,"to perform the funeral ceremonies of Vāli, the . counsellors and other"
8013,SECTION XXV.,"monkeys, having lost their king and embraced Angada, proceeded weeping."
8014,SECTION XXV.,"And other subject monkeys followed them. And all other she-monkeys,"
8015,SECTION XXV.,"headed by Tārā, having lost their lord, bewailed, exclaiming again and"
8016,SECTION XXV.,"again—""O hero, O hero"".—And they, thus bewailing piteously, followed"
8017,SECTION XXV.,"their lord. And in response to the bewailings of she-monkeys, hills and"
8018,SECTION XXV.,"forests, as if, bewailed on all sides. Monkeys, ranging in the forest,"
8019,SECTION XXV.,made funeral piles on the banks of the hill-streams and in solitary
8020,SECTION XXV.,"watery nooks. Thereupon laying down from their shoulders the conveyance,"
8021,SECTION XXV.,"those foremost of monkeys stationed themselves in a corner, being"
8022,SECTION XXV.,"stricken with grief. And Tārā, beholding her husband’s body on the"
8023,SECTION XXV.,"conveyance, placed his head on her lap and bewailed, overwhelmed with"
8024,SECTION XXV.,"grief. ""O lord of monkeys! O my lord! O my dear one! O thou used to"
8025,SECTION XXV.,luxuries! O thou having long arms! O my darling! behold me. Why dost
8026,SECTION XXV.,"thou not behold these monkeys, racked with sorrow? O conferrer of"
8027,SECTION XXV.,"honors, thy countenance looks as if beaming with joy; although thou art"
8028,SECTION XXV.,"dead, and thou appearest as if alive, having the hue of the setting Sun."
8029,SECTION XXV.,"O monkey, Death himself, under the semblance of Rāma, is attracting"
8030,SECTION XXV.,"thee, who with one shaft in the battle, hath rendered us all widows. O"
8031,SECTION XXV.,"best of kings, these she-monkeys cannot go by jumping. Dost thou not"
8032,SECTION XXV.,"percive that they have travelled so far on foot? Those thy wives, having"
8033,SECTION XXV.,"moon-like countenances, have always thy welfare in view. Why dost thou"
8034,SECTION XXV.,"not, O best of monkeys, cast thy looks towards them and Sugriva? O king,"
8035,SECTION XXV.,"these thy counsellors, thy wives headed by Tārā, and all these citizens"
8036,SECTION XXV.,"are bewailing around thee. O slayer of foes, do thou despatch thy"
8037,SECTION XXV.,"counsellors to the city and we shall all enjoy in this forest, excited"
8038,SECTION XXV.,"with _amour_."" The other she-monkeys, worked with sorrow, raised up Tārā"
8039,SECTION XXV.,bewailing thus being exercised with grief consequent upon the demise of
8040,SECTION XXV.,"her husband. Thereupon Angada along with Sugriva, overwhelmed with"
8041,SECTION XXV.,"grief, weeping, placed his Sire’s body on the funeral pile. And putting"
8042,SECTION XXV.,"fire duly, he circumambulated his Sire, bound for a journey for good."
8043,SECTION XXV.,"Having duly cremated Vāli’s body,the foremost of monkeys arrived at a"
8044,SECTION XXV.,river of auspicious water with a view to perform the watery ceremony.
8045,SECTION XXV.,"And all these monkeys along with Sugriva and Tārā, placing Angada before"
8046,SECTION XXV.,"them, sprinkled water. And the highly powerful Kākuthsha, equally"
8047,SECTION XXV.,"aggrieved like Sugriva, being as poorly, cronducted duly the obsequious"
8048,SECTION XXV.,"ceremonies of Vāli. Thereupon cremating Vāli, gifted with unequalled"
8049,SECTION XXV.,"prowess, slain with one shaft of the foremost of Ikswakus, and like unto"
8050,SECTION XXV.,"flaming fire, Sugriva appeared before Rāma who was in the company of"
8051,SECTION XXV.,Lakshmana.
8052,SECTION XXV.,
8053,SECTION XXV.,
8054,SECTION XXV.,
8055,SECTION XXVI.,SECTION XXVI.
8056,SECTION XXVI.,
8057,SECTION XXVI.,
8058,SECTION XXVI.,"And thereupon those foremost of monkeys waited there, surrounding"
8059,SECTION XXVI.,"Sugriva exercised with grief and wearing wetted cloth. And they all,"
8060,SECTION XXVI.,"approaching the mighty-armed Rāma of unwearied actions, stationed"
8061,SECTION XXVI.,themselves with folded hands like unto the great ascetics around the
8062,SECTION XXVI.,"Grand-Father (of the celestials). Thereupon Hanumān, the son of Marut,"
8063,SECTION XXVI.,resembling a golden hill and having a countenance resembling the rising
8064,SECTION XXVI.,"Sun, spake with folded hands, saying:—""By thy assistance, O Kākuthstha,"
8065,SECTION XXVI.,"O lord, this great ancestral kingdom of the highly powerful monkeys,"
8066,SECTION XXVI.,"having sharpened teeth, incapable of being acquired by the high-souled"
8067,SECTION XXVI.,"ones, hath been attained to (by Sugriva). Being commanded by thee, he"
8068,SECTION XXVI.,"along with his friends, entering this city, shall perform the royal"
8069,SECTION XXVI.,"duties. And being duly bathed he shall worship thee particularly, with"
8070,SECTION XXVI.,"garlands, jewels, scents and _oshadhis_. It behoveth thee to enter this"
8071,SECTION XXVI.,pleasant mountain cave and satisfy these monkeys by installing (Sugriva
8072,SECTION XXVI.,"on the throne)."" Being thus accosted by Hanumān, the highly intelligent"
8073,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāghava, skilled in speech and the slayer of foes, replied:— ""O gentle"
8074,SECTION XXVI.,"Hanumān, abiding by my Sire’s mandate, I shall not enter a hamlet or a"
8075,SECTION XXVI.,"city for these fourteen years. Let Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys,"
8076,SECTION XXVI.,enter this magnificent celestial cave and do ye all instal him speedily
8077,SECTION XXVI.,"on the throne."" Having thus addressed Hanumān, Rāma spake unto Sugriva,"
8078,SECTION XXVI.,"saying:—""Conversant with customs as thou art, do thou instal this"
8079,SECTION XXVI.,"generous and heroic Angada, gifted with prowess and honoring customs, as"
8080,SECTION XXVI.,the heir-apparent of the throne. This brave and eldest son of thy elder
8081,SECTION XXVI.,"brother— Angada, is truly worthy of the heir-apparentship. O gentle one,"
8082,SECTION XXVI.,"this month of _Srābana_, which is the first of those four months which"
8083,SECTION XXVI.,"make up the rainy season, hath set in and this is not the time therefore"
8084,SECTION XXVI.,to institute any enquiry about Sitā. Do thou therefore enter thy
8085,SECTION XXVI.,auspicious city and I shall live in this mountain along with Lakshmana.
8086,SECTION XXVI.,"Pleasant indeed is this mountain cave, spacious, filled with air, water"
8087,SECTION XXVI.,and many lotuses. Thou shalt engage in endeavours to bring about the
8088,SECTION XXVI.,"destruction of Rāvana, after _Kartika_ sets in. This is not the proper"
8089,SECTION XXVI.,"time, O gentle one, and do thou enter thy own city. And being installed"
8090,SECTION XXVI.,"on the throne do thou enhance the joy of thy friends."" Being thus"
8091,SECTION XXVI.,"commanded by Rāma, Sugriva, the foremost of monkeys entered the pleasant"
8092,SECTION XXVI.,"city of Kishkindhā, reared by Vāli. Encircling that lord of monkeys"
8093,SECTION XXVI.,"thousands of them entered the city. Beholding the lord of monkeys, the"
8094,SECTION XXVI.,"subjects bowed unto him, lowering their heads on the ground. Welcoming"
8095,SECTION XXVI.,"the subjects and raising them up, the highly powerful Sugriva entered"
8096,SECTION XXVI.,"the pleasant inner apartment of his brother. On his entering the city,"
8097,SECTION XXVI.,"his friends installed the highly powerful foremost of monkeys—Sugriva,"
8098,SECTION XXVI.,on the throne like unto the celestials placing the thousand-eyed Deity
8099,SECTION XXVI.,(on the kingdom). The monkeys brought for him a copper-colored golden
8100,SECTION XXVI.,"umbrella, white chowries, a magnificent golden staff, diverse jewels,"
8101,SECTION XXVI.,"various seeds and medicating drugs, roots and flowers of glomerous fig"
8102,SECTION XXVI.,"trees, white clothes, white sandal paste, fragrant garlands, flowers"
8103,SECTION XXVI.,"growing in water and on land, celestial sandal and various scents, fried"
8104,SECTION XXVI.,"grain, gold, _Priyangu_ honey,¹¹⁵ clarified butter, curd, tiger-skin, a"
8105,SECTION XXVI.,"pair of excellent sandals, _gorochana_¹¹⁶ and red _Arsenic._ Carrying"
8106,SECTION XXVI.,"all those things there came sixteen maids, highly delighted. Thereupon"
8107,SECTION XXVI.,those monkeys pleased the foremost of twice-born ones with jewels
8108,SECTION XXVI.,"clothes and eatables, with a view to instal that best of monkeys. And"
8109,SECTION XXVI.,"these conversant with _mantras_ threw clarified butter, sanctified by"
8110,SECTION XXVI.,"_mantras_, into flaming fire burning on a _Kuça_ bed. And placing him on"
8111,SECTION XXVI.,"an excellent throne facing the east, uttering duly _mantras_ in that"
8112,SECTION XXVI.,golden room situated on the summit of the picturesque palace and
8113,SECTION XXVI.,"beautified with magnificent coverlets and garlands, and collecting pure"
8114,SECTION XXVI.,"water from various rivers, sacred places and oceans, those foremost of"
8115,SECTION XXVI.,"monkeys kept it in golden jars. Gaya, Gabaksha, Gabaya, Sarava,"
8116,SECTION XXVI.,"Gandhamadana, Main da, Divida, Hanumān and Jambuban, installed Sugriva"
8117,SECTION XXVI.,with auspicious horns of a bull and golden jars according to the rites
8118,SECTION XXVI.,prescribed by _Sastras_ and sanctioned by the great saints like unto the
8119,SECTION XXVI.,"celestials installing the thousand eyed Deity with pure, fragrant water."
8120,SECTION XXVI.,"Sugriva being installed thus, these high-souled and foremost of monkeys,"
8121,SECTION XXVI.,"by hundreds and thousands, began to clatter with delight. Abiding by"
8122,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāma’s words, Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, embracing Angada, conferred"
8123,SECTION XXVI.,on him the heir-apparentship of the throne. And Angada being thus
8124,SECTION XXVI.,"installed, those best of monkeys, highly delighted, adored the"
8125,SECTION XXVI.,"high-souled Sugriva, extolling him again and again. Angada and Sugriva"
8126,SECTION XXVI.,"being thus established, they all, greatly delighted, praised again and"
8127,SECTION XXVI.,"again the high-souled Rāma and Lakshmana. And the city of Kishkindhā,"
8128,SECTION XXVI.,"filled with stoutly built people and adorned with pennons and flags,"
8129,SECTION XXVI.,appeared beautiful in the mountain cave. Communicating unto the
8130,SECTION XXVI.,"high-souled Rāma the news of installation, the highly powerful lord of"
8131,SECTION XXVI.,"monkey hosts (Sugriva) getting back his wife Rumā, regained the kingdom"
8132,SECTION XXVI.,like unto the lord of celestials.

8154,SECTION XXVII.,"unto his humble younger brother Lakshmana, the enhancer of wealth, the"
8155,SECTION XXVII.,"following sound words, worthy of being spoken on that occasion—""O"
8156,SECTION XXVII.,"Saumitri, O slayer of foes, in this pleasant and spacious mountain cave"
8157,SECTION XXVII.,"filled with air, we shall pass the rainy season. O son of a king, this"
8158,SECTION XXVII.,"summit of the hill is excellent and picturesque, beautified with white,"
8159,SECTION XXVII.,"black and coppery stones, filled with diverse metals and river frogs,"
8160,SECTION XXVII.,"covered with diverse trees and pleasant creepers, resounded with the"
8161,SECTION XXVII.,musical notes of various birds and cries of peacocks and beautified with
8162,SECTION XXVII.,"various flowery trees,such as _Malati_, _Kundas_, _Sindubara_,¹¹⁷"
8163,SECTION XXVII.,"_Sirisa_,¹¹⁸ _Kadamba_, _Arjuna,_¹¹⁹ and _Sarja_.¹²⁰ O son of a king,"
8164,SECTION XXVII.,this pond filled with full blown lotuses shall always be near our cave.
8165,SECTION XXVII.,"This cave shall be worthy of our habitation, O gentle one, having its"
8166,SECTION XXVII.,"north-eastern part low and the western part high. There is, O Saumitri,"
8167,SECTION XXVII.,"at the entrance of the cave, a level, beautiful, spacious stone, black"
8168,SECTION XXVII.,"like unto collyrium. Behold O my brother, on the north, the summit of"
8169,SECTION XXVII.,"the hill, resembling collyrium and a rising cloud. There appears on the"
8170,SECTION XXVII.,south a beautiful white hill resembling the Kailaça filled with various
8171,SECTION XXVII.,"metals. Behold before the cave the mudless stream, flowing towards the"
8172,SECTION XXVII.,east like unto _Janhavi_¹²¹ in the _Trikuta_¹²² mountain. This rivulet
8173,SECTION XXVII.,"appears like unto a damsel ornamented and clothed, being filled with"
8174,SECTION XXVII.,"various trees, such as—_Sandal_, _Tilaka_, _Sāla_, _Tamalas_,"
8175,SECTION XXVII.,"_Atimuktas_,¹²³ _Padmaka_, _Saralas_,¹²⁴ _Asokas_, _Bāneeras,_¹²⁵"
8176,SECTION XXVII.,"_Timidas_, _Vakulas_, _Ketakas,_ _Hintalas_, _Tinicas_, _Neepas_,"

8180,SECTION XXVII.,"having picturesque banks, and various jewels, is as it were laughing on"
8181,SECTION XXVII.,"all sides. Here it appears covered with violet lotuses, here with red"

8183,SECTION XXVII.,and picturesque stream is filled with various water fowls and
8184,SECTION XXVII.,_Chakravakas_ and served by many a saint. Behold there the rows of
8185,SECTION XXVII.,pleasant sandal trees and those _Kukuvas_ which have grown up as it were
8186,SECTION XXVII.,"like unto mental emotion. Picturesque indeed is this place, O slayer of"

8192,SECTION XXVII.,"monkeys, getting back his wife, regaining his kingdom, and attaining to"
8193,SECTION XXVII.,"regal splendour."" Having said this, Rāghava, along with Lakshmana, dwelt"
8194,SECTION XXVII.,in that _Prasravana_ hill abounding in caves and bowers. He did not
8195,SECTION XXVII.,attain to a best felicity although he lived in that pleasant hill filled
8196,SECTION XXVII.,"with many things. Pondering over the ravishment of his spouse, dearer"
8197,SECTION XXVII.,"than his life, beholding the setting of the Sun in particular, he did"
8198,SECTION XXVII.,"not go to sleep, although he laid himself on the bed in the night. His"
8199,SECTION XXVII.,"younger brother Lakshmana, equally aggrieved, spoke unto Kākutstha, thus"
8200,SECTION XXVII.,bewailing being exercised with grief and almost beside himself with
8201,SECTION XXVII.,"sorrow, consequent upon Sitā’s bereavement, saying:—""It doth not behove"
8202,SECTION XXVII.,"thee to lament thus, being exercised with grief—it is not unknown unto"
8203,SECTION XXVII.,"thee that people, thus bewailing do exhaust themselves by and by. O"
8204,SECTION XXVII.,"Rāghava, thou art devoted to pious actions and the services of the Deity"
8205,SECTION XXVII.,"in this world— and pious, energetic and dost believe in the existence of"
8206,SECTION XXVII.,God. Without being persevering thou shalt not be able to destroy in

8208,SECTION XXVII.,grief and take recourse to energy and thou shalt be able to slay that
8209,SECTION XXVII.,"Rākshasa with all his family. What of the destruction of Rāvana, thou"
8210,SECTION XXVII.,"art O Kākutstha, capable of uprooting the earth with oceans, forests and"

8212,SECTION XXVII.,"encompass the destruction of Rāvana with his kingdom and kinsmen. I,"
8213,SECTION XXVII.,"too, am exciting thy latent energy like unto fire hidden in ashes with"
8214,SECTION XXVII.,oblations. Welcoming the auspicious and well-meaning accents of
8215,SECTION XXVII.,"Lakshmana, Rāghava again spake unto him the following affectionate"
8216,SECTION XXVII.,"words:— ""O Lakshmana, truly do thy words become thee, affectionate,"
8217,SECTION XXVII.,"devoted, truthful and intent on my welfare as thou art. Renouncing this"
8218,SECTION XXVII.,"grief standing in the way of all business, I shall call forth, the more,"
8219,SECTION XXVII.,this my energy on the occasion of displaying my prowess. I shall live
8220,SECTION XXVII.,"here, awaiting the autumn and abiding by thy words and awaiting as well"
8221,SECTION XXVII.,Sugriva’s pleasure and the clear currents of the rivers. Heroes
8222,SECTION XXVII.,receiving favours always return them; the ungrateful lose the friendship
8223,SECTION XXVII.,"of the honest."" Considering Rāma’s words as highly sound and welcoming"
8224,SECTION XXVII.,"them therefore, Lakshmana, with folded hands, spake unto Rāma of"
8225,SECTION XXVII.,"graceful appearance, displaying his own intelligence—""O lord of men, I"
8226,SECTION XXVII.,fully approve of all thou hast said. The monkey-chief shall soon engage
8227,SECTION XXVII.,"in our service. Resolved on the destruction of thy enemy, do thou spend"
8228,SECTION XXVII.,"here this rainy season awaiting the autumn. Subduing thy wrath, and"

8267,SECTION XXVIII.,"torn cloth, the sky is enveloped with cool clouds, coppery with the rays"

8269,SECTION XXVIII.,"breezes as its breath, sprinkled with sandal-like evening rays and"
8270,SECTION XXVIII.,"covered with yellow clouds, is appearing as it were like one stricken"
8271,SECTION XXVIII.,"with _amour_. The earth, afflicted with perspiration and filled with new"

8273,SECTION XXVIII.,_Ketaka_ smelling breezes may be drunk up in the cavity formed by
8274,SECTION XXVIII.,"putting the hands together, like unto cold water discharged off the"

8276,SECTION XXVIII.,"_Ketakas_ and rid of its enemies like unto Sugriva, hath been bathed"
8277,SECTION XXVIII.,"with showers. These hillocks, having clouds for dark deer-skins, heavy"

8279,SECTION XXVIII.,appearing like so many _Brahmins_ who have finished their studies. The
8280,SECTION XXVIII.,"sky, being struck by thunders like unto so many golden lashes, is, as"

8308,SECTION XXVIII.,"water, are constantly moving, sometimes resting on the high summits of"
8309,SECTION XXVIII.,"the mountains and emitting a muttering sound. And rows of cranes, fond"
8310,SECTION XXVIII.,"of clouds, rising up in the sky, delighted and moved by the wind, are"
8311,SECTION XXVIII.,"appearing like a garland of white lotuses, spread along the welkin. And"
8312,SECTION XXVIII.,"the earth, covered with green grass and variegated with newly born"
8313,SECTION XXVIII.,"insects, is appearing like a damsel clothed with a white blanket spotted"
8314,SECTION XXVIII.,here and there with lac. (In this part of the year) sleep is gradually
8315,SECTION XXVIII.,"overcoming the great God _Nārāyana_, the river is flowing speedily"
8316,SECTION XXVIII.,"towards the ocean, the delghted cranes are approaching the clouds and"
8317,SECTION XXVIII.,the damsels are proceeding towards their lovers. The peacocks are
8318,SECTION XXVIII.,"dancing at the forest skirts, the _Kadamva_ trees are covered with"
8319,SECTION XXVIII.,"flowers, the bulls have become attached unto kine and the earth has"
8320,SECTION XXVIII.,become charming with corns and forests. The rivers are flowing by; the
8321,SECTION XXVIII.,clouds are discharging waters; the infuriated elephants are emitting
8322,SECTION XXVIII.,"terrible roars; the forest-lands are growing more charming; persons,"
8323,SECTION XXVIII.,"separated from their wives, are growing more anxious; the peacocks are"
8324,SECTION XXVIII.,dancing with delight and the monkeys are greatly comforted for Sugriva’s
8325,SECTION XXVIII.,"attaining to the kingdom. By the fountains in the forests, the"
8326,SECTION XXVIII.,infuriated elephants delighted with the fragrance of the _Ketaka_
8327,SECTION XXVIII.,"flowers and maddened with the noise of the water falls, are emitting"
8328,SECTION XXVIII.,"terrible roars along with the peacocks. The black bees, resorting to the"
8329,SECTION XXVIII.,"branches of the _Kadamba_ trees and overwhelmed with showers, are, as"
8330,SECTION XXVIII.,"if, slowly discharging their temporal juice— namely the honey of flowers"
8331,SECTION XXVIII.,collected by them ere while. The branches of rose-apple trees containing
8332,SECTION XXVIII.,enough of fruits like unto a collection of char coal are so appearing as
8333,SECTION XXVIII.,"if the black bees are drinking the juice thereof. The dense clouds,"
8334,SECTION XXVIII.,"ornamented with pennon-like lightnings and emitting terrible roars, are"
8335,SECTION XXVIII.,"appearing like so many elephants, mad after fighting. The infuriated"
8336,SECTION XXVIII.,"lord of elephants, following in the track and ranging in the hills and"
8337,SECTION XXVIII.,"forests, hearing the muttering of clouds and taking it for the uproar of"
8338,SECTION XXVIII.,"another elephant, has turned back, with a view to enter into conflict"
8339,SECTION XXVIII.,"with him. Somewhere the bees are humming, somewhere the peacocks are"
8340,SECTION XXVIII.,dancing —somewhere are ranging the infuriated elephants—and in this way
8341,SECTION XXVIII.,the forest-land has assumed diverse appearances. It appears like unto a
8342,SECTION XXVIII.,"drinking-place,covered with _Kadambas_, _Sarjas_, _Arjunas_ and lotuses"
8343,SECTION XXVIII.,"growing on land, filled with water resembling honey and with the dance"
8344,SECTION XXVIII.,"and cries of mad peacocks. The birds, having their wings discolored,"
8345,SECTION XXVIII.,"being wet with water, delighted and thirsty, are drinking the drops of"
8346,SECTION XXVIII.,clear water falling on leaves and discharged by the Lord of
8347,SECTION XXVIII.,"celestials.¹²⁶ The sonorous humming of the bees, being accompanied by"
8348,SECTION XXVIII.,"the gutteral sound of the frogs and the mutterings of the clouds,"
8349,SECTION XXVIII.,"resembling the sound of _Mridangas_, an organised music, as if, hath"
8350,SECTION XXVIII.,"begun in the forest. Sometimes dancing, sometimes setting up loud cries,"
8351,SECTION XXVIII.,"sometimes placing themselves against the tops of the trees, the"
8352,SECTION XXVIII.,"peacocks, having beautifully ornamented exteriors, have commenced music"
8353,SECTION XXVIII.,in the forest. And rising from their perpetual sleep by the muttering of
8354,SECTION XXVIII.,"clouds, the frogs, assuming various shapes and making diverse sounds,"
8355,SECTION XXVIII.,are setting up cries being distressed with new watery showers. The
8356,SECTION XXVIII.,"rivers, carrying _Chakrabākas_ as their breast and leaving behind their"
8357,SECTION XXVIII.,"old banks, are approaching, being excited, their own lord with various"
8358,SECTION XXVIII.,"new presents. Clouds, big with new waters coming in contact with violet"
8359,SECTION XXVIII.,"ones are appearing as such; and sometimes, touching the hills burnt by"
8360,SECTION XXVIII.,"forest-fire, are appearing like deep-rooted hills. The elephants are"
8361,SECTION XXVIII.,"ranging in this charming forest-land, carrying the fragrance of _Neepas_"
8362,SECTION XXVIII.,"and _Arjunas_, having its green swards filled with _Indragopas_¹²⁷ and"
8363,SECTION XXVIII.,"with delighted, peacocks dancing all around. The black bees, delighted,"
8364,SECTION XXVIII.,"are drinking honey, embracing the shower-distressed and new filaments of"
8365,SECTION XXVIII.,the lotuses and _Kadamva_ flowers. (In this season) the elephants are
8366,SECTION XXVIII.,"infuriated, the bulls are delighted, the lions have grown more powerful,"
8367,SECTION XXVIII.,"the hills are charming— the kings are devoid of all active pursuits, and"
8368,SECTION XXVIII.,the Lord of celestials is engaged in sport with clouds. The clouds
8369,SECTION XXVIII.,"ranging in the welkin and discharging heavy showers, are roaring like"
8370,SECTION XXVIII.,"unto ocean; and the rivers, ponds and pools are deluging the earth with"
8371,SECTION XXVIII.,their watery contents. (In this season) heavy showers set in—the wind
8372,SECTION XXVIII.,bloweth mightily and the rivers breaking down their banks flow quickly
8373,SECTION XXVIII.,"blockading the wayfares. The mountains are, as if, displaying their own"
8374,SECTION XXVIII.,"beauty and grace being as it were bathed by the cloud-like jars,"
8375,SECTION XXVIII.,conferred by the lord of celestials and brought by the wind like unto a
8376,SECTION XXVIII.,king sprinkled by men. The sky is enveloped with clouds and neither the
8377,SECTION XXVIII.,sun nor the stars can be seen— the earth is satisfied with new
8378,SECTION XXVIII.,showers—and the quarters being covered with darkness cannot be seen. The
8379,SECTION XXVIII.,"high summits, of the mountains, being washed by showers and beautified"
8380,SECTION XXVIII.,"by far-stretching waterfalls resembling pearls, are appearing more"
8381,SECTION XXVIII.,"graceful. The heavy mountain waterfalls, losening the rocks and"
8382,SECTION XXVIII.,"stretching over the caves filled with the cries of peacocks, are"
8383,SECTION XXVIII.,"appearing like a pearl-necklace. And the quick streaming waterfalls, of"
8384,SECTION XXVIII.,"the mountains, washing the summits of the hills, and resembling the"
8385,SECTION XXVIII.,"pearls, are being deposited in the cave at the foot. And watery drops"
8386,SECTION XXVIII.,resembling the pearls of the necklaces used by celestial damsels are
8387,SECTION XXVIII.,pouring on all sides. The setting of the Sun is announced by the birds
8388,SECTION XXVIII.,"taking to their nests, lotuses growing pale and _Mālatis_ blossoming."
8389,SECTION XXVIII.,"The royal marches are all stopped, and the soldiers, who have already"
8390,SECTION XXVIII.,marched are waiting in the way—hostility and wayfares have been equally
8391,SECTION XXVIII.,blockaded by water. This month of _Bhādra_ is the time of studying for
8392,SECTION XXVIII.,"those Brahmins, who chant _Sāma Vedas_. Having roofed all his houses and"
8393,SECTION XXVIII.,"stored up his food, Bharata, the king of Koçala hath set upon the"
8394,SECTION XXVIII.,performance of _Ashara_ sacrifices. The river _Saraju_ is now brimful
8395,SECTION XXVIII.,with water. Seeing me return as if Ayodhya herself is making a
8396,SECTION XXVIII.,delightful noise. Clearly manifest are now all the signs of the rainy
8397,SECTION XXVIII.,"season and Sugriva, rid of his enemies, established on the vast kingdom,"
8398,SECTION XXVIII.,"and regaining his wives, hath attained to best felicity. And I am, O"
8399,SECTION XXVIII.,"Lakshmana, waning everyday like unto the banks of a river, being"
8400,SECTION XXVIII.,separated from my spouse and deprived of my vast kingdom. Immense is my
8401,SECTION XXVIII.,"grief, inaccessible is this rainy season and mighty is my enemy, Rāvana;"
8402,SECTION XXVIII.,methinks it is impossible for me to bring about the discomfiture of my
8403,SECTION XXVIII.,foe. Owing to the unfitness of the season (for marching against my foe)
8404,SECTION XXVIII.,"and the wayfares being inacessible, I cannot possibly request Sugriva"
8405,SECTION XXVIII.,(to march) although he is prepared to abide by my mandate. Moreover
8406,SECTION XXVIII.,"after a good deal of affliction he has regained his wives, and my"
8407,SECTION XXVIII.,service is of very great difficulty; so I do not wish to request that
8408,SECTION XXVIII.,"monkey-chief now. Forsooth, shall Sugriva think of the benefits (he has"
8409,SECTION XXVIII.,"received from me) after enjoying rest for sometime, when the time for"
8410,SECTION XXVIII.,"action shall arrive. Therefore I shall, O Lakshmana, live here, awaiting"
8411,SECTION XXVIII.,the pleasure of Sugriva and the clear currents of the rivers (the
8412,SECTION XXVIII.,"autumn). Heroes receiving benefits, do always return them. The"
8413,SECTION XXVIII.,"ungrateful lose the good wishes of the great ones."" Being thus accosted,"
8414,SECTION XXVIII.,"Lakshmana, with folded hands, respecting highly his words, spake unto"
8415,SECTION XXVIII.,"the graceful Rāma, pointing out his own welfare. ""Forsooth shall that"
8416,SECTION XXVIII.,lord of monkeys carry out all thy wishes. Do thou therefore spend here
8417,SECTION XXVIII.,"the rainy season, awaiting the autumn."""

8431,SECTION XXIX.,"conversant with effects proper to the time or season, approaching the"
8432,SECTION XXIX.,"Lord of monkeys, addressed him with various sound, reasonable and"
8433,SECTION XXIX.,"pleasant words, well-meaning, true and teaching the means of acquiring"
8434,SECTION XXIX.,"forgiveness, piety and wealth. Acquiring riches Sugriva hath grown"
8435,SECTION XXIX.,"careless for the collection of righteousness and wealth, is following"
8436,SECTION XXIX.,"the track of the vicious, and is addicted to the satisfaction of sensual"
8437,SECTION XXIX.,appetites—having all his actions stopped and desires attained—and given
8438,SECTION XXIX.,"to enjoyments with damsels. Having attained all his desires and wishes,"
8439,SECTION XXIX.,"his own wife and the much-desired-for Tārā, Sugriva is sporting with"
8440,SECTION XXIX.,"them, day and night, without any affliction, like unto the Lord of"

8442,SECTION XXIX.,"affairs at the hands of the counsellors, without looking to them, and"
8443,SECTION XXIX.,confiding fully in their abilities he is living like one under the
8444,SECTION XXIX.,"influence of passions—""Thou hast attained thy kingdom, fame, and thy"
8445,SECTION XXIX.,vast ancestral wealth. It now behoveth thee to perform thy duties by thy
8446,SECTION XXIX.,"friends. Truly doth his kingdom, fame and prowess increase who is"
8447,SECTION XXIX.,cognizant of the seasonableness of time and doth good to his friends. O
8448,SECTION XXIX.,"king, truly doth he attain to a vast kingdom, who hath the same wealth,"
8449,SECTION XXIX.,"soldiery and body with his friends. It becometh thee, therefore, who art"
8450,SECTION XXIX.,"crowned with a good character, and who dost wend a blameless track, to"
8451,SECTION XXIX.,work out thy friend’s well-being (as promised by thee). He who doth not
8452,SECTION XXIX.,"engage in the service of his friends renouncing all business, becometh"
8453,SECTION XXIX.,"void of all energy and involved in unnecessary troubles. And he, who"
8454,SECTION XXIX.,"engageth in his friend’s service after the proper season is over, does"
8455,SECTION XXIX.,"nothing to his well-being, though he performs a great thing. O slayer of"
8456,SECTION XXIX.,"foes, soon shall the time for performing thy friend’s service, be over;"
8457,SECTION XXIX.,"do thou therefore encompass Rāghava’s good, namely the searching out of"
8458,SECTION XXIX.,"Vaidehi. O king, Rāma, conversant with the seasonableness of time and"
8459,SECTION XXIX.,"wise as he is, is not informing thee of it, though the proper time is"
8460,SECTION XXIX.,"past; and though he is in hurry, he is waiting for thee. Rāghava as well"
8461,SECTION XXIX.,"as Lakshmana, who are the instruments of thy attaining to this vast"
8462,SECTION XXIX.,"kingdom, and thy friends for so long a time, are persons of incomparable"
8463,SECTION XXIX.,prowess by virtue of their unequalled accomplishments. He hath already
8464,SECTION XXIX.,"performed thy service, and it behoveth thee now, O lord of monkeys, to"
8465,SECTION XXIX.,"command the foremost of monkeys to engage in his service. To engage, out"
8466,SECTION XXIX.,"of season, in a service, uncalled for, is not blameable; but to defer"
8467,SECTION XXIX.,the performance of an action in proper time after promising is indeed an
8468,SECTION XXIX.,"object of censure. O lord of monkeys, thou dost engage even in the"
8469,SECTION XXIX.,"service of one who doth thee no good, then why shalt thou not engage in"
8470,SECTION XXIX.,the benefit of Rāma who hath favoured thee by encompassing the
8471,SECTION XXIX.,destruction (of Vāli) and securing for thee thy kingdom? O lord of
8472,SECTION XXIX.,"monkeys and bears, truly thou art gifted with prowess and strength, why"
8473,SECTION XXIX.,dost thou not prepare thyself for satisfying Daçarathee’s commands?
8474,SECTION XXIX.,"Daçarathee himself is capable of subduing the celestials, Asuras and"
8475,SECTION XXIX.,great serpents—he is simply awaiting the fulfilment of thy promise. He
8476,SECTION XXIX.,hath performed a great service at the risk of his life—we shall
8477,SECTION XXIX.,therefore find out Vaidehi whether she is in this earth or in the
8478,SECTION XXIX.,"welkin. Even the celestials, Dānavas, Gandharbas, Asuras, Marutas,"
8479,SECTION XXIX.,Yakshas are afraid of him in the battlefield—what of the insignificant
8480,SECTION XXIX.,"Rākshasas. O lord of monkeys, it therefore behoveth thee to do good by"
8481,SECTION XXIX.,"all means unto the powerful Rāma, who benefitted thee before. O lord of"
8482,SECTION XXIX.,"monkeys, who is there amongst us, who shall not at thy command proceed"
8483,SECTION XXIX.,"unto water, sky or the region under the earth? O blameless one, there"
8484,SECTION XXIX.,"are more than one _koti_ of invincible monkeys under thee, do thou"
8485,SECTION XXIX.,"command, who shall proceed and to what quarter?"" Hearing these words of"
8486,SECTION XXIX.,"Hanumān, said on a very proper occasion, the intelligent Sugriva, made"
8487,SECTION XXIX.,up his mind for a worthy end. Thereupon the highly intelligent Sugriva
8488,SECTION XXIX.,"ordered the ever active Neela, to collect soldiers from various"
8489,SECTION XXIX.,"quarters. ""Do thou so arrange as all my hosts and soldiers with their"
8490,SECTION XXIX.,commanders soon come here. Do thou soon bring here at my behest all the
8491,SECTION XXIX.,energetic and quick-coursing monkeys and commanders spreading their
8492,SECTION XXIX.,conquests to the end of the earth. (After their arrival) do thou thyself
8493,SECTION XXIX.,inspect and count all those monkeys. He who shall not reach here within
8494,SECTION XXIX.,fifteen days shall be punished with the loss of his life. There is no
8495,SECTION XXIX.,"need of scrutinizing my orders. Abiding by my order, do thou see along"
8496,SECTION XXIX.,"with Angada all the elderly monkeys."" Having thus arranged, that best of"

8510,SECTION XXX.,"regaining his sense after sometime, the highly intelligent king—Rāghava"
8511,SECTION XXX.,began to think of Vaidehi although always present in his mind. And
8512,SECTION XXX.,beholding the clear sky void of lightnings and clouds and filled with
8513,SECTION XXX.,"the noise of _Sārasas_, Rāghava began to lament piteously, stationing"
8514,SECTION XXX.,himself on the summit of the hill ornamented with metals of golden hue.
8515,SECTION XXX.,And beholding the autumnal sky he engaged in the meditation of his
8516,SECTION XXX.,"beloved spouse. How shall that _Sārasa_-voiced damsel be pleased to-day,"
8517,SECTION XXX.,"who, while sporting in the hermitage, used to warble like _Sārasas_, to"
8518,SECTION XXX.,"invite them. Beholding _Asana_ trees, as if covered with golden flowers"
8519,SECTION XXX.,and not beholding me how shall that damsel be pleased? How that
8520,SECTION XXX.,"exquisitely fine damsel having a sweet voice shall be pleased to-day,"
8521,SECTION XXX.,who used formerly to awake at the sounds of the drakes? Hearing the
8522,SECTION XXX.,"noise of her companions—_Chakrabākas_, how shall that one, of expansive"
8523,SECTION XXX.,"eyes resembling lotuses, live? Without her having the eyes of a fawn, I"
8524,SECTION XXX.,"do not attain to felicity to-day, ranging at large by ponds, streams,"

8526,SECTION XXX.,"approach of the autumn, distress her the more on account of my"
8527,SECTION XXX.,"separation and her personal charms."" Thus bewailed that best son of a"
8528,SECTION XXX.,king like unto the bird _Sāranga_ soliciting water from the lord of
8529,SECTION XXX.,"celestials. And the graceful Lakshmana, returning from the picturesque"
8530,SECTION XXX.,"mountain-summits where he had sojourned in quest of fruits, beheld his"
8531,SECTION XXX.,"elder brother. And beholding in that lonely forest his brother, racked"
8532,SECTION XXX.,with anxious thoughts hard to bear and almost beside himself (with
8533,SECTION XXX.,"grief) the high-minded Saumitri, prompted by his brother’s grief, spoke"
8534,SECTION XXX.,"unto him very poorly, saying:—""O worshipful one, what hast thou"
8535,SECTION XXX.,perpetrated by placing thyself under the control of passions and
8536,SECTION XXX.,defeating thy manliness? Thy deep and devout meditation hath been
8537,SECTION XXX.,purloined by thy grief; and it is by religious contemplation that thy
8538,SECTION XXX.,"grief shall be terminated now. O brother, after going through the"
8539,SECTION XXX.,"ceremonies of bathing and so forth, and acquiring peace, do thou bring"
8540,SECTION XXX.,all thy time under thy control by virtue of the concentration of soul;
8541,SECTION XXX.,"and being of unmitigated strength do thou resort to power and help, the"
8542,SECTION XXX.,"key-notes for the accomplishment of thy great object. O lord of men,"
8543,SECTION XXX.,"Jānaki, husbanded by thee, is not capable of being easily possessed by"
8544,SECTION XXX.,"others. O hero who getting at a flame of fire, doth not burn himself?"""
8545,SECTION XXX.,"Thereupon Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana, gifted with royal marks, addressing"
8546,SECTION XXX.,"him with natural and resolute words and saying:— ""What thou hast said,"
8547,SECTION XXX.,"is sound, well-meaning, sanctioned by polity and speaks of piety, wealth"
8548,SECTION XXX.,"and forgiveness. It should therefore, without the least doubt, be"
8549,SECTION XXX.,performed by me. It behoveth me to engage in contemplation about the
8550,SECTION XXX.,eternal truth regarding the Deity and in ascetic observances. Or else O
8551,SECTION XXX.,"Prince, it is not proper to think of the fruits of a difficult, highly"
8552,SECTION XXX.,"developed and energetic action."" Thereupon thinking of Maithelee, having"
8553,SECTION XXX.,"eyes resembling lotus-petals, Rāma spoke unto Lakshmana with a dried"
8554,SECTION XXX.,"countenance. ""Having satisfied the earth with a profuse discharge of"
8555,SECTION XXX.,"water, produced crops and thus, finished his work, the thousand eyed"
8556,SECTION XXX.,"Deity is sitting silent. O son of a king, the clouds, muttering a long"
8557,SECTION XXX.,"and deep sound and approaching the hills and trees, are calmed having"
8558,SECTION XXX.,discharged their liquid contents. Having made the ten quarters dark
8559,SECTION XXX.,"blue, the clouds, resembling blue lotuses, have become calm, like unto"
8560,SECTION XXX.,"elephants without temporal juice. O gentle one, high gales accompanied"
8561,SECTION XXX.,"with rains, big with water and fragrant with _Kutaja_ and _Arjuna_"
8562,SECTION XXX.,"flowers being driven before hither and thither, have now become silent O"
8563,SECTION XXX.,"innocent Lakshmana, the sounds of clouds, elephants, peacocks, and"
8564,SECTION XXX.,"fountains, have been all stopped. Hills, having variegated summits,"
8565,SECTION XXX.,"being washed by dense clouds and thus free from dirt and impurities, do"
8566,SECTION XXX.,appear elegant being sprinkled by the rays of the Moon. Forsooth hath
8567,SECTION XXX.,"the autumn set in, dividing its grace in the branches of _Saptachada_"
8568,SECTION XXX.,"trees, in the rays of the Sun and Moon with stars and in the gaits of"
8569,SECTION XXX.,the excellent elephants. Surely hath the autumnal grace resorted to many
8570,SECTION XXX.,things. And it hath appeared more profusely in the lotuses blossomed by
8571,SECTION XXX.,the first rays of the Sun. Scented sweet with the flower of _Saptachada_
8572,SECTION XXX.,"trees, borowing the musical notes of bees, following the wind and"
8573,SECTION XXX.,"subduing the pride of infuriated elephants, the autumn is appearing very"
8574,SECTION XXX.,elegant. The swans are playing with _Chakrabakas_ having splendidly
8575,SECTION XXX.,"spacious wings, fond of cupid, crusted with the filaments of lotuses,"
8576,SECTION XXX.,and arriving at the banks of the rivers. The autumnal grace is appearing
8577,SECTION XXX.,"more elegant being divided in infuriated elephants, in proud kine, and"
8578,SECTION XXX.,"in streams of clear currents. Beholding the sky divested of clouds,"
8579,SECTION XXX.,without manifesting the beauty of their tails and renouncing their
8580,SECTION XXX.,"attachment unto their beloved mates, amusements and beauty, the peacocks"
8581,SECTION XXX.,are as if all engaged in meditation in the forest. The forest-lands are
8582,SECTION XXX.,"as if a-blaze with many a sweet-scented picturesque _Priyaka_ trees,"
8583,SECTION XXX.,having a golden hue and their tops lowered down with the weight of
8584,SECTION XXX.,"flowers. The gaits, of the elephants rendered idle with a profuse"
8585,SECTION XXX.,"discharge of temporal juice, fond of forests and water lilies, smelling"
8586,SECTION XXX.,the fragrance of the flowers of _Saptachhada_ trees and accompanied by
8587,SECTION XXX.,"their mates, have become slow. The sky is clear like unto a sword—the"
8588,SECTION XXX.,"streams have become of feeble currents—the wind, cool and scented with"
8589,SECTION XXX.,"the fragrance of white esculent waterlilies, is blowing—and quarters"
8590,SECTION XXX.,have become devoid of darkness. The mud has been dried up by the rays of
8591,SECTION XXX.,the Sun and the earth is filled with dust—this is the time for
8592,SECTION XXX.,"preparation for inimical kings (to enter into conflict). The bulls,"
8593,SECTION XXX.,"having their beauty enhanced by the autumn, and their body covered with"
8594,SECTION XXX.,"dust, delighted, infuriated and hence desirous of entering into"
8595,SECTION XXX.,"skirmish, have been setting up terrible roars in the midst of kine. The"
8596,SECTION XXX.,"she-elephants, moving slowly, fond, passionate and accompanied by other"
8597,SECTION XXX.,"members, have been following their passionate mates, in the forest,"
8598,SECTION XXX.,"embracing them. Leaving behind their excellent ornaments—the tails, the"
8599,SECTION XXX.,"peacocks, getting at the banks of the rivers, have been going away"
8600,SECTION XXX.,poorly and with depressed hearts as if being remonstrated with by the
8601,SECTION XXX.,_Sārasas_. Having terrified the _Kārandavas_ and _Chakrabakas_ with
8602,SECTION XXX.,"their mighty roars, the elephants, having cleft trunks and being"
8603,SECTION XXX.,"agitated again and again, have been drinking water in the ponds filled"
8604,SECTION XXX.,with full blown lotuses. The drakes have been jumping delightedly into
8605,SECTION XXX.,"the rivers, mudless, covered with sands, full of clear water, filled"
8606,SECTION XXX.,with kine and resounded with the notes of _Sārasas_. Now hath stopped
8607,SECTION XXX.,"the noise of rivers, clouds, fountains, water, the high winds, the"
8608,SECTION XXX.,peacocks and the mirthless frogs. And venomous snakes of vareiagated
8609,SECTION XXX.,"colors, having lived for a pretty long time during the rains without"
8610,SECTION XXX.,"food, have on the approach of the autumn, come out of their dens,"
8611,SECTION XXX.,"hungry, in quest of their prey. The red-dyed evening hath renounced the"
8612,SECTION XXX.,"welkin, being delighted at the touch of the rays of the Moon and opening"
8613,SECTION XXX.,a little her eyes—the stars. Having the rising Moon for her elegant
8614,SECTION XXX.,"countenance, the stars for her excellent open eyes and the rays for a"
8615,SECTION XXX.,"piece of white garment, the night appeareth like a damsel wearing a"
8616,SECTION XXX.,"white cloth. Having fed on ripe white rice, the excellent rows of"
8617,SECTION XXX.,delighted _Sārasas_ are flying quickly up to the sky like unto a
8618,SECTION XXX.,"well-strung garland shaken by the wind. The water, of the lake filled"
8619,SECTION XXX.,"with sleeping drakes and water lilies, is appearing like the sky in the"
8620,SECTION XXX.,"night, devoid of clouds and filled with the Full Moon and stars. The"
8621,SECTION XXX.,"ponds, having the drakes scattering hither and thither for their girdles"
8622,SECTION XXX.,"and engarlanded with full blown lotuses and water lilies, are appearing"
8623,SECTION XXX.,like so many damsels ornamented with diverse ornaments. The sound set up
8624,SECTION XXX.,by the wind in the dawn like unto that of a pipe accompanied by the
8625,SECTION XXX.,"music of a trumpet, being mixed with the noise of the caves and bulls"
8626,SECTION XXX.,are as if multiplying each other. The banks of the rivers are being
8627,SECTION XXX.,dressed by the newly blossomed flowers shaken by the mild breezes and
8628,SECTION XXX.,"Kāças. like unto clean, washed silken clothes. The black bees, bold,"
8629,SECTION XXX.,"given to drinking honey, rendered yellow with the filaments of lotuses"
8630,SECTION XXX.,"and _Asana_ flowers, delighted and accompanied by their mates are"
8631,SECTION XXX.,"following the wind in the forest. The clear water, the blossoming"
8632,SECTION XXX.,"flowers, the noise of _Craunchas_, the ripe white rice, the mild"
8633,SECTION XXX.,"breezes, the clear Moon announce the approach of the Autumn—the removers"
8634,SECTION XXX.,"of the rains. The rivers, having fishes for their girdles, have become"
8635,SECTION XXX.,of slackened course like unto damsels moving slowly in the dawn being
8636,SECTION XXX.,"enjoyed by their husbands. The mouths of the rivers, filled with"
8637,SECTION XXX.,"_Chakrabākas_, covered with aquatic plants and clothed with _Kāças_ are"
8638,SECTION XXX.,appearing like unto the countenances of damsels pasted with yellow
8639,SECTION XXX.,pigments. The most powerful Cupid hath taken up his terrible bow in this
8640,SECTION XXX.,forest filled with _Asana_ flowers appearing like unto arrows and the
8641,SECTION XXX.,hum of delighted bees. Having satisfied the people with a profuse
8642,SECTION XXX.,"discharge of water, filled the rivers and pools and covered the earth"
8643,SECTION XXX.,"with crops, the clouds have disappeared renouncing the sky. The rivers"
8644,SECTION XXX.,in this season of autumn have been gradually showing their banks. O thou
8645,SECTION XXX.,"of excellent looks, the ponds (in this season) appear exquisitely fine,"
8646,SECTION XXX.,"being filled with _Kurara_ birds and _Chakrabākas_. O son of king, this"
8647,SECTION XXX.,"is the time of preparation for inimical kings, desirous of defeating one"
8648,SECTION XXX.,"another. O son of a king, this is the best time for royal marches, but I"
8649,SECTION XXX.,do not find Sugriva preparing himself for that end. There appear on the
8650,SECTION XXX.,"summits of the hills flowers _Asanas_, _Saptaparnas_, _Kavidāras_,"
8651,SECTION XXX.,"_Bandhugeebas_, and _Tamālās_. Behold, O Lakshmana, the banks of the"
8652,SECTION XXX.,"rivers filled with swans, _Sārasas_, _Chakrabākas_ and _Kuraras_."
8653,SECTION XXX.,"Stricken as I am with grief, these four months, the season of rains,"
8654,SECTION XXX.,"appeared unto me like a hundred year, not beholding Sitā. Like unto"
8655,SECTION XXX.,"_Chakrabākas_ following their mates, Sitā, taking the terrible forest of"
8656,SECTION XXX.,"Dandaka for a picturesque garden, used to follow me there. O Lakshmana,"
8657,SECTION XXX.,"Sugriva, is not inclined to show any commiseration towards me, who am"
8658,SECTION XXX.,"separated from my beloved spouse, deprived of my kingdom, banished and"
8659,SECTION XXX.,"striken with sorrow. Regarding me as one without any to back him,"
8660,SECTION XXX.,"deprived of his kingdom, insulted by Rāvana, wretched, of a distant"
8661,SECTION XXX.,"land, under the influence of amour and therefore seeking his help,"
8662,SECTION XXX.,"(Sugriva hath not felt pity for me). O subduer of foes, O thou of"
8663,SECTION XXX.,"excellent looks, for these reasons, I have been insulted by that"
8664,SECTION XXX.,vicious-souled king of monkeys—Sugriva. Having appointed the time to
8665,SECTION XXX.,"institute enquiries about Sitā, that wicked-minded one hath now forgot"
8666,SECTION XXX.,it on the accession of his new dignity. Do thou therefore repair to
8667,SECTION XXX.,"Kishkindhā and speak of me unto that stupid lord of monkeys—Sugriva,"
8668,SECTION XXX.,"addicted to rural enjoyments. And do thou tell him—’He, who breaks his"
8669,SECTION XXX.,"promise made unto a powerful benefactor who solicits his favour, is"
8670,SECTION XXX.,regarded by people as vile. He is a true hero and an excellent person
8671,SECTION XXX.,who verifies his words whether good or bad. Ungrateful they are who do
8672,SECTION XXX.,"not, after attaining their ends, engage in the service of those of their"
8673,SECTION XXX.,friends who have not accomplished their objects; even those living on
8674,SECTION XXX.,raw flesh do not feed on their gore after their death’. And ask him if
8675,SECTION XXX.,he wishes to behold in battle-field the golden bow resembling a
8676,SECTION XXX.,"lightning. And ask him more, if he wishes to hear the terrible twang of"
8677,SECTION XXX.,"my bow resembling the noise of thunder, when I am enraged in battle. O"
8678,SECTION XXX.,"hero, O son of a king, when apprised of my prowess assisted by thee,"
8679,SECTION XXX.,will he not recapitulate in his mind (that he may be destroyed by us
8680,SECTION XXX.,"like unto Vāli)? O conqueror of enemies’ cities, does not that lord of"
8681,SECTION XXX.,"monkeys, after accomplishing his object, think of the conditions under"
8682,SECTION XXX.,which our friendship was contracted? Does not that lord of monkeys think
8683,SECTION XXX.,"that he has spent four months in enjoyments, having promised and"
8684,SECTION XXX.,"appointed the season, after rains, (for making) enquiries about Sitā""?"
8685,SECTION XXX.,"Does not Sugriva feel pity for us, who are racked with sorrow, being"
8686,SECTION XXX.,"addicted to drinking with friends and counsellors? Do thou go, O hero, O"
8687,SECTION XXX.,thou of mighty strength and relate unto Sugriva these my angry words. ’O
8688,SECTION XXX.,"Sugriva, do not neglect thy promise and wend the way trodden by Vāli. I"
8689,SECTION XXX.,killed Vāli only with my shaft in the battle-field; but if thou dost
8690,SECTION XXX.,deviate from the path of truth I shall destroy thee along with thy
8691,SECTION XXX.,"kinsmen and relatives.’ O thou best of men, do thou speedily relate unto"
8692,SECTION XXX.,"him all those benefits which we shall reap by his actions, for the"
8693,SECTION XXX.,"proper season is well-nigh past. O best of monkeys, do thou carry out"
8694,SECTION XXX.,thy promise remembering the eternal existence of virtue. Do thou not
8695,SECTION XXX.,"behold the spirit of Vāli in the abode of Death, being killed by the"
8696,SECTION XXX.,"shaft discharged by me."" Beholding his elder brother thus enraged and"
8697,SECTION XXX.,"bewailing, the fiery-spirited Lakshmana, the best of men, became enraged"
8698,SECTION XXX.,with Sugriva.
8699,SECTION XXX.,

8701,SECTION XXX.,
8702,SECTION XXXI.,SECTION XXXI.
8703,SECTION XXXI.,
8704,SECTION XXXI.,
8705,SECTION XXXI.,"Lakshmana again addressed his high-minded elder brother, the son of a"
8706,SECTION XXXI.,"king, influenced by passion, stricken with grief, and poorly, with the"
8707,SECTION XXXI.,"following words. ""That monkey shall not follow the actions of the pious,"
8708,SECTION XXXI.,shall not think of the great fruit (the accession of kingdom) reaped by
8709,SECTION XXXI.,our friendship; he shall not enjoy the riches of the monkey-kingdom
8710,SECTION XXXI.,because he has not the right understanding to make good his promise.
8711,SECTION XXXI.,Owing to the wane of his understanding in consequence of thy favour he
8712,SECTION XXXI.,is addicted to rural enjoyments and hath forgot to return thy benefits.
8713,SECTION XXXI.,"O hero, killed let him espy his elder brother Vāli. It is not proper to"
8714,SECTION XXXI.,confer kingdom upon that wicked-minded one. I am unable to bear the
8715,SECTION XXXI.,outburst of my ire—forsooth shall I kill to-day—that liar Sugriva. May
8716,SECTION XXXI.,the son of Vāli with other principal monkeys engage in quest of that
8717,SECTION XXXI.,"daughter a king."" Beholding him rise up from the seat with bow in his"
8718,SECTION XXXI.,hand and greatly wrought up with anger and hearing him thus announce his
8719,SECTION XXXI.,"intention about the destruction of Sugriva, Rāma, the slayer of foes,"
8720,SECTION XXXI.,spake unto him the following humble words worthy of being spoken on that
8721,SECTION XXXI.,"occasion. ""Persons like thee on this earth do not perpetrate the crime"
8722,SECTION XXXI.,of destroying their friends. He is truly a great hero and an excellent
8723,SECTION XXXI.,"person who subdues anger by his right understanding, O Lakshmana, it is"
8724,SECTION XXXI.,not proper for thee to bring about the destruction of thy friend; do
8725,SECTION XXXI.,thou follow thy former friendship and good feelings. Avoiding harsh
8726,SECTION XXXI.,"words do thou address Sugriva, who has violated his promise, with"
8727,SECTION XXXI.,"soothing words."" Being thus duly counselled by his elder brother, that"
8728,SECTION XXXI.,"best of men, the heroic Lakshmana—the slayer of foes, entered the city."
8729,SECTION XXXI.,"Thereupon the highly intelligent Lakshmana of right understanding, and"
8730,SECTION XXXI.,"ever intent upon the welfare of his brother, taking up a bow like unto"
8731,SECTION XXXI.,"Indra’s, resembling the summit of a hill and terrible as Death himself,"
8732,SECTION XXXI.,"entered, wrought up with ire, the abode of the king of monkeys like the"
8733,SECTION XXXI.,hill Mandāra. Intelligent like _Vrihaspati_ and ever abiding by his
8734,SECTION XXXI.,"elder brother’s behest, Lakshmana, revolving in his mind what he should"
8735,SECTION XXXI.,"say as well as Sugriva’s answers, and enveloped with the fire of anger"
8736,SECTION XXXI.,"arising from the excitement of his brother’s _amour_, and therefore"
8737,SECTION XXXI.,"displeased, proceeded quick as air. And on he proceeded, felling down by"
8738,SECTION XXXI.,"his velocity, _Sāla_, _Tāla_, and _Asvakarna_ trees, throwing aside the"
8739,SECTION XXXI.,"mountain summits and other trees, breaking rocks into pieces with his"
8740,SECTION XXXI.,feet and striding very quickly like unto a fleet-coursing elephant. And
8741,SECTION XXXI.,"that best of Ikshwākus, beheld that splendid city of the king of"
8742,SECTION XXXI.,"monkeys, hard to enter, surrounded by monkey-herds, and mountains. And"
8743,SECTION XXXI.,"having his lips swollen with anger for Sugriva, Lakshmana beheld the"
8744,SECTION XXXI.,terrible monkeys walking outside the city. Beholding that best of
8745,SECTION XXXI.,"men—Lakshmana, the monkeys resembling elephants entered the mountainous"
8746,SECTION XXXI.,stronghold and took up the summits of the hill and huge trees. And
8747,SECTION XXXI.,"observing them armed, Lakshmana was doubly inflamed with anger like unto"
8748,SECTION XXXI.,"fire kindled with fuels. And beholding Lakshmana, highly enraged,"
8749,SECTION XXXI.,"terrible as Death himself at the time of dissolution, the monkeys"
8750,SECTION XXXI.,"stricken with fear, fled away, by hundreds, into various quarters."
8751,SECTION XXXI.,"Thereat those foremost of monkeys, entering the palace of Sugriva,"
8752,SECTION XXXI.,"communicated unto him, Lakshmana’s ire and approach. That amorous chief"
8753,SECTION XXXI.,"of monkeys, attached unto Tārā, paid no heed to the words of those"
8754,SECTION XXXI.,"foremost of monkeys. Thereupon those terrible monkeys, resembling hills,"
8755,SECTION XXXI.,"elephants and clouds, went out of the city being commanded by the"
8756,SECTION XXXI.,"minister. Some of them had sharpened teeth and nails, some were"
8757,SECTION XXXI.,"grim-visaged, some had teeth like those of tigers, some had the strength"
8758,SECTION XXXI.,"of ten elephants, some had the strength of a hundred elephants and some"
8759,SECTION XXXI.,"had that of a thousand elephants. Thereupon Lakshmana, angry, espied the"
8760,SECTION XXXI.,city of _Kishkindhdā_ hard to enter and surrounded by mighty monkeys
8761,SECTION XXXI.,with trees in their hands. And getting over the ditch around the city
8762,SECTION XXXI.,"walls, those terrible-looking monkeys stationed themselves openly. And"
8763,SECTION XXXI.,"meditating upon Sugriva’s error and his brother’s interest, the"
8764,SECTION XXXI.,"self-controlled Lakshmana, heroic, proceeded onwards. Sighing hot and"
8765,SECTION XXXI.,"hard, that best of men—Lakshmana, with reddened eyes appeared like unto"
8766,SECTION XXXI.,"smoky fire. He appeared like unto a terrible serpent of five mouths,"
8767,SECTION XXXI.,"having the top of the arow for his tongue, the bow for his expanded hood"
8768,SECTION XXXI.,and his own prowess for the poison. Beholding him like the flaming fire
8769,SECTION XXXI.,"of dissolution and enraged lord of serpents, Angada, out of fear, became"
8770,SECTION XXXI.,"exceedingly sorry. Thereupon the far-famed Lakshmana, having his eyes"
8771,SECTION XXXI.,"reddened with ire, spoke unto Angada, saying""—O child, do thou inform"
8772,SECTION XXXI.,"Sugriva of my arrival. O conqueror of foes, do thou tell him:—"
8773,SECTION XXXI.,"Lakshmana, the younger brother of Rāma, being stricken with grief on"
8774,SECTION XXXI.,"account of his brother’s disaster, hath come to thee and is waiting at"
8775,SECTION XXXI.,"the gate. If it pleaseth thee, do thou make good thy promise.’ Saying"
8776,SECTION XXXI.,"these words do thou speedily return, O my child, O conqueror of foes."""
8777,SECTION XXXI.,"Hearing Lakshmana’s words, Angada, overwhelmed with grief, aproaching"
8778,SECTION XXXI.,his uncle said—’Saumitree hath arrived here.’ Being greatly agitated
8779,SECTION XXXI.,"with harsh words, Angada, with a pale and poorly countenance issued out"
8780,SECTION XXXI.,"speedily and approaching, touched first the king’s feet and afterwards"
8781,SECTION XXXI.,with reverence Rumā’s feet. That one of exceeding prowess first touched
8782,SECTION XXXI.,the feet of his uncle then saluted again his mother and afterwards
8783,SECTION XXXI.,touching the feet of Rumā related unto them every thing in full. That
8784,SECTION XXXI.,"monkey, possessed by _amour_ and under the influence of liquor, being"
8785,SECTION XXXI.,asleep could not hear (what Angada had said). Beholding Lakshmana highly
8786,SECTION XXXI.,"enraged, the monkeys, possessed by fear, began to make noise as they"
8787,SECTION XXXI.,"were welcoming him. They, approaching Lakshmana began to set up a"
8788,SECTION XXXI.,terrible roar like unto thunder and resembling the uproar of lions and
8789,SECTION XXXI.,the noise of water-falls. By that terrible sound awoke that
8790,SECTION XXXI.,"monkey-chief, having coppery eyes, agitated, adorned with garlands and"
8791,SECTION XXXI.,"possessed by liquor. Hearing the words of Angada, the two counsellors of"
8792,SECTION XXXI.,"Sugriva, intelligent and of magnificent looks, along with him,"
8793,SECTION XXXI.,approached that lord of monkeys. And those two ministers _Yaksha_ and
8794,SECTION XXXI.,"_Pravaba_, to give him proper counsels, informed (that monkey-chief) of"
8795,SECTION XXXI.,the arrival of Lakshmana. Satisfying Sugriva with words pointing out his
8796,SECTION XXXI.,"welfare, they sitting by him, spake unto that lord of wind resembling"
8797,SECTION XXXI.,"the king of celestials, saying:—""Of those two great and truthful"
8798,SECTION XXXI.,"brothers Rāma and Lakshmana, who are born as men, worthy of attaining to"
8799,SECTION XXXI.,"kingdom and who have gained for thee thy kingdom, Lakshmana, with a bow"
8800,SECTION XXXI.,"in his hand, is waiting at thy gate. And afraid of whom, the monkeys,"
8801,SECTION XXXI.,"trembling, are setting up terrible roars. That Lakshmana, Rāghava’s"
8802,SECTION XXXI.,"brother, having words for his charioteer, and perseverance for his"
8803,SECTION XXXI.,"chariot, hath approached thee at his brother’s command. O blameless"
8804,SECTION XXXI.,"king, by that Lakshmana—Tārā’s darling, Angada hath been despatched unto"
8805,SECTION XXXI.,"thee. O king, of monkeys, that highly powerful one, having his eyes full"
8806,SECTION XXXI.,"of ire, is waiting at thy gate, as if burning down with his eyes all the"
8807,SECTION XXXI.,"monkeys. O king, along with thy children and friends do thou repair unto"
8808,SECTION XXXI.,him speedily and bowing unto him with thy head down do thou pacify his
8809,SECTION XXXI.,"wrath. And do thou, O king, with a composed heart, perform what the"
8810,SECTION XXXI.,virtuous-souled Rāma hath ordered thee to do and thus fulfil thy
8811,SECTION XXXI.,promise.

8814,SECTION XXXI.,
8815,SECTION XXXII.,SECTION XXXII.
8816,SECTION XXXII.,
8817,SECTION XXXII.,
8818,SECTION XXXII.,"Hearing the words of Angada as well as of Lakshmana’ s wrath, the"
8819,SECTION XXXII.,"self-controlled Sugriva along with his counsellors, left his seat."
8820,SECTION XXXII.,"Ascertaining the weight and lightness of the present occasion, that one,"
8821,SECTION XXXII.,expert in counsels and abiding by their advice spake unto the expert
8822,SECTION XXXII.,"counsellors, saying:—""I have not done him any wrong, nor have I spoken"
8823,SECTION XXXII.,unto him any improper word. I do not know why Rāghaya’s brother
8824,SECTION XXXII.,Lakshmana hath become offended with me. Lakshmana hath been falsely
8825,SECTION XXXII.,"apprised of my imaginary weakness by my enemies, always looking to my"
8826,SECTION XXXII.,"dark sides. It behoveth ye all, to ascertain now speedily according to"
8827,SECTION XXXII.,your knowledge and right understanding (the cause of Lakshmana’s wrath).
8828,SECTION XXXII.,I do not fear Lakshmana or Rāghava; but friends enraged without any
8829,SECTION XXXII.,cause do invariably produce fear. It is easy to contract friendship but
8830,SECTION XXXII.,"very difficult to sustain it; for owing to the fickleness of our minds,"
8831,SECTION XXXII.,a very slight cause brings about separation. I have not done him any
8832,SECTION XXXII.,good proportionate to what the high-souled Rāma had done for me; and it
8833,SECTION XXXII.,"is for this reason that I am afraid of him."" Being thus addressed by"
8834,SECTION XXXII.,"Sugriva—Hanumān, the foremost of monkey-counsellors, spoke, according to"
8835,SECTION XXXII.,"his own understanding, saying:—""It is no wonder, O lord of monkeys, that"
8836,SECTION XXXII.,"thou hast not forgot the unexpected benefit, (thou hadst received at the"
8837,SECTION XXXII.,"hands of Rāma). To encompass thy well-being, Vāli, powerful as the Lord"
8838,SECTION XXXII.,"of celestials, was fearlessly destroyed by the heroic Rāghava. There is"
8839,SECTION XXXII.,"not the least doubt, that Rāghava, out of love, is enraged with thee,"
8840,SECTION XXXII.,"and hath despatched his younger brother Lakshmana, the enhancer of"
8841,SECTION XXXII.,"prosperity. O thou foremost of those conversant with time, the"
8842,SECTION XXXII.,"auspicious autumn, green with _Saptachhada_ flowers, hath set in and"
8843,SECTION XXXII.,"thou, given up to enjoyments, doth not percieve it. The sky, having the"
8844,SECTION XXXII.,"clouds removed, is full of clear stars and planets. The quarters, the"
8845,SECTION XXXII.,"ponds and rivers are all clear. O best of monkeys, finding thee"
8846,SECTION XXXII.,"forgetful, Lakshmana hath come here to inform thee that the proper time"
8847,SECTION XXXII.,hath arrived. Do thou patiently hear all these harsh words of the
8848,SECTION XXXII.,"high-souled Rāma, racked with sorrow and separated from his spouse,"
8849,SECTION XXXII.,"which Lakshmana, shall relate unto thee. Thou hast acted improperly"
8850,SECTION XXXII.,"towards him, and I do not find any thing tending to thy welfare but thy"
8851,SECTION XXXII.,satisfying Lakshmana with folded hands. The kings should be addressed
8852,SECTION XXXII.,with auspicious words by their counsellors always ministering unto them
8853,SECTION XXXII.,"proper counsels. And it is for this reason, I am addressing thee with"
8854,SECTION XXXII.,"these sound words. Rāghava, taking up his bow, while enraged, can bring"
8855,SECTION XXXII.,"under subjection the entire world, inhabited by the celestials, _Asuras_"
8856,SECTION XXXII.,"and _Gandharbas_. Remembering his former service, it doth not behove"
8857,SECTION XXXII.,"thee, grateful as thou art, to excite his wrath, who should be pleased"
8858,SECTION XXXII.,"again. Bowing unto him, with thy children and friends, do thou, O king,"
8859,SECTION XXXII.,"satisfying thy promise, seek his shelter like unto a wife placing"
8860,SECTION XXXII.,"herself under the control of her husband. O lord of monkeys, it doth not"
8861,SECTION XXXII.,"behove thee, to neglect even in thought, the behests of Rāma and his"
8862,SECTION XXXII.,younger brother; for thou art fully aware of the prowess of Rāghava like
8863,SECTION XXXII.,"unto the lord of celestials, and passing human power."

8867,SECTION XXXIII.,SECTION XXXIII.
8868,SECTION XXXIII.,
8869,SECTION XXXIII.,
8870,SECTION XXXIII.,"Thereupon, Lakshmana, the slayer of foes, commanded, entered, at the"
8871,SECTION XXXIII.,"behest of Rāma, the pleasant city of Kishkindhā situated in the centre"
8872,SECTION XXXIII.,"of caves. Beholding Lakshmana, the highly powerful monkeys, having huge"
8873,SECTION XXXIII.,"persons and waiting at the gate, stood all with folded hands. And seeing"
8874,SECTION XXXIII.,"Daçaratha’s son highly enraged and sighing again and again, the monkeys"
8875,SECTION XXXIII.,stood silent and did not interrupt him. The graceful Lakshmana espied
8876,SECTION XXXIII.,that huge picturesque and celestial cave adorned with jewels and flowery
8877,SECTION XXXIII.,"gardens. It was filled with palatial buildings, various jewels and"
8878,SECTION XXXIII.,"flowery trees, producing at all times wished-for fruits. It was"
8879,SECTION XXXIII.,beautified with good-looking monkeys—children of the celestials and
8880,SECTION XXXIII.,_Gandharbas_ wearing celestial garlands and clothes and assuming shapes
8881,SECTION XXXIII.,"at will. It was fragrant with the sweet smell of sandal wood, _Aguru_"
8882,SECTION XXXIII.,and lotuses and its highways were equally fragrant with the smell of
8883,SECTION XXXIII.,honey. And Lakshmana beheld there many spacious buildings like unto the
8884,SECTION XXXIII.,hills _Vindhya_ and _Meru_ and rivers of clear water. And he also
8885,SECTION XXXIII.,"surveyed the picturesque dwellings of Angada, Mainda, Divida, Gavaya,"
8886,SECTION XXXIII.,"Gabaksha, Gaja, Sarava, Vidhutmali, Sampāti, Suryaksha, Hanumān,"
8887,SECTION XXXIII.,"Beerabahu, Subahu, Nala, Kumuda, Sushena, Tārā, Jambabān, Dadhibaktra,"
8888,SECTION XXXIII.,"Neela, Sunetra and Supātala like unto sable clouds adorned with"
8889,SECTION XXXIII.,"excellent garlands, filled with rice and jewels and beautiful damsels."
8890,SECTION XXXIII.,Unobstructed the highly powerful Saumitri entered the picturesque abode
8891,SECTION XXXIII.,of Sugriva like unto the Sun entering into a collection of dense clouds.
8892,SECTION XXXIII.,The abode of this lord of monkeys was like unto the palace of the Lord
8893,SECTION XXXIII.,"of celestials, ornamented with the tops of white buildings resembling"
8894,SECTION XXXIII.,the summits of the Kailaça hill and flowery trees producing at all
8895,SECTION XXXIII.,"times, wished-for fruits; covered with beautiful trees having cool"
8896,SECTION XXXIII.,shades and bearing celestial fruits and flowers resembling the
8897,SECTION XXXIII.,"molten-gold. And that virtuous-souled one, crossing the seven rooms"
8898,SECTION XXXIII.,filled with conveyances and seats beheld the secret apartment (of that
8899,SECTION XXXIII.,"monkey-chief), having many a gold and silver bed-steads with excellent"
8900,SECTION XXXIII.,coverlets and fine seats. No sooner had he entered the inner apartment
8901,SECTION XXXIII.,"than he heard a musical sound, well-measured and accompanied by the"
8902,SECTION XXXIII.,music of the stringed instrument. And that highly powerful one beheld in
8903,SECTION XXXIII.,the abode of Sugriva many a beautiful damsel proud of their youth and
8904,SECTION XXXIII.,"beauty, sprung from respectable families, adorned with splendid"
8905,SECTION XXXIII.,"ornaments, engaged in stringing excellent garlands. And he observed"
8906,SECTION XXXIII.,"Sugriva’s servants, well fed, contented, not hurry in offering their"
8907,SECTION XXXIII.,services and without splendid ornaments. Hearing the sounds of women’s
8908,SECTION XXXIII.,"girdles and their _Nupurs_,¹²⁸ the graceful Lakshmana became highly"
8909,SECTION XXXIII.,"ashamed. And highly enraged at the sound of the ornaments, the hero"
8910,SECTION XXXIII.,filled all the quarters with the twang of his bow. Lakshmana of
8911,SECTION XXXIII.,"mighty-arms stood silent in a nook, thinking of his improper conduct of"
8912,SECTION XXXIII.,"entering into (Sugriva’s) seraglio, albeit he was wrought up with ire in"
8913,SECTION XXXIII.,"consequence of Sugriva’s neglecting Rāma’s service. Thereupon Sugriva,"
8914,SECTION XXXIII.,"the lord of monkeys, being apprised of Lakshmana’s approach by the twang"
8915,SECTION XXXIII.,"of his bow and terrified, trembled on his throne, and thought"
8916,SECTION XXXIII.,"aside:—""Forsooth hath Saumitri, fond of his brother, come, whose"
8917,SECTION XXXIII.,approach was announced by Angada before. Informed before by Angada of
8918,SECTION XXXIII.,"his approach, and made doubly sure by the twang of the bow, that monkey"
8919,SECTION XXXIII.,"came to know of Lakshmana’s arrival and turned pale. Thereupon Sugriva,"
8920,SECTION XXXIII.,"the foremost of monkeys, wrought up with fear, addressed the fine"
8921,SECTION XXXIII.,"looking Tārā with the following well-meaning words:—""O beautiful lady,"
8922,SECTION XXXIII.,"dost thou know, why hath the mild-natured younger brother of Rāma,"
8923,SECTION XXXIII.,"arrived here enraged? O blameless lady, dost thou perceive any cause of"
8924,SECTION XXXIII.,"the Prince’s wrath? Forsooth, that best of men, is not enraged for a"
8925,SECTION XXXIII.,"slight cause. Considering aright, dost thou speedily inform me if I have"

8927,SECTION XXXIII.,"him in person and pacify him with soothing words. Beholding thee, that"
8928,SECTION XXXIII.,pure-souled one shall not be worked with ire; great men do never behave
8929,SECTION XXXIII.,roughly towards the females. Approaching him do thou console him and
8930,SECTION XXXIII.,thereafter I shall see that conqueror of foes having eyes resembling
8931,SECTION XXXIII.,"lotus-petals."" Thereupon Tārā, with faltering feet and eyes wild with"
8932,SECTION XXXIII.,"wine, the golden chains of her zone flowing (about her hips),—graced"
8933,SECTION XXXIII.,"with auspicious marks, saught Lakshmana’s presence with downcast looks."
8934,SECTION XXXIII.,"Beholding Tārā, the queen of the lord of monkeys, Lakshmana, the"
8935,SECTION XXXIII.,"high-souled son of a king, restraining his anger on the approach of a"
8936,SECTION XXXIII.,"female, stood with his head hung down, conducting himself like an"
8937,SECTION XXXIII.,"ascetic. Renouncing modesty under the influence of liquor, and finding"
8938,SECTION XXXIII.,"the king’s son well pleased, Tārā spake unto Lakshmana, bold and loving"
8939,SECTION XXXIII.,"words, in order to console him. ""O son of a king, what is the cause of"
8940,SECTION XXXIII.,thy wrath? Who is there who hath not abode by thy commands? Who can
8941,SECTION XXXIII.,"remain without anxiety, beholding fire in a forest filled with dried"
8942,SECTION XXXIII.,"trees?"" Hearing the soothing words of Tārā, Lakshmana, undaunted, spoke"
8943,SECTION XXXIII.,"again, greatly manifesting his friendship:—""O thou intent on thy"
8944,SECTION XXXIII.,"husband’s welfare, dost thou not perceive that thy husband is by and by"
8945,SECTION XXXIII.,"losing piety and wealth, being addicted to amorous enjoyments? O Tārā,"
8946,SECTION XXXIII.,thy husband doth not think of us who are moved with sorrow— but is
8947,SECTION XXXIII.,"addicted to sensual enjoyments only, being surrounded by parasites."
8948,SECTION XXXIII.,(Having promised that he would institute enquiries about Sitā after four
8949,SECTION XXXIII.,"months), that lord of monkeys hath well-nigh spent the entire period,"
8950,SECTION XXXIII.,being influenced by liquor and addicted to enjoyments along with thee.
8951,SECTION XXXIII.,"For the attainment of piety and wealth, drinking is not a proper course."
8952,SECTION XXXIII.,"It is by drinking that people lose piety, wealth and desire. He who doth"
8953,SECTION XXXIII.,"not return the services of his benefactor, loseth piety. He who loseth"
8954,SECTION XXXIII.,"friendship with a qualified friend, loseth wealth. He is the best friend"
8955,SECTION XXXIII.,who is gifted with wealth and is truthful; and thy husband hath
8956,SECTION XXXIII.,"relinquished such a friend gifted with these two qualities. And,"
8957,SECTION XXXIII.,"therefore, he doth not abide by the virtue of preserving friendship. O"
8958,SECTION XXXIII.,"thou expert in business, this being the case, do thou advise us as to"
8959,SECTION XXXIII.,"what we should do."" Hearing the sweet words of Lakshmana consonant with"
8960,SECTION XXXIII.,"piety and wealth, Tārā again addressed him about Rāma’s business, yet"
8961,SECTION XXXIII.,"remaining unaccomplished, with words inspiring confidence,—""O son of a"
8962,SECTION XXXIII.,"king, this is not the time for displaying thy wrath; it is not proper to"
8963,SECTION XXXIII.,"be angry with one’s own friends. O hero, it behoveth thee to put up with"
8964,SECTION XXXIII.,"the error of him who hath thy welfare in view. O prince, who,"
8965,SECTION XXXIII.,"accomplished with excellent virtues, gets enraged with one of inferior"
8966,SECTION XXXIII.,"merits? O prince, who, like thee, an offspring of asceticism, is worked"
8967,SECTION XXXIII.,up with ire against the virtue of forgiveness? I know the (cause of the)
8968,SECTION XXXIII.,wrath of that heroic monkey’s friend. I know the time for action. I know
8969,SECTION XXXIII.,"what thou hast done for us. I know what is due from us to thee. And, O"
8970,SECTION XXXIII.,"foremost of men, I also know the irrisistible force of Kāma. I know by"
8971,SECTION XXXIII.,"whom Sugriva has been taken captive, and that his heart is not now in"
8972,SECTION XXXIII.,"the work. As thou hast come under the governance of anger, thy mind has"
8973,SECTION XXXIII.,not felt the influence of desire. Even a human being that hath conceived
8974,SECTION XXXIII.,"love, does not stay for place or time or interest. Do thou forgive that"
8975,SECTION XXXIII.,"lord of the monkey race, thy brother, influenced by carnality, who is by"
8976,SECTION XXXIII.,"thee, and who through the urgency of lust, has banished shame. Even"
8977,SECTION XXXIII.,"Maharshis finding delight in religion and asceticism, setting their"
8978,SECTION XXXIII.,"hearts upon satisfying lust, (ultimately) become fast bound by"
8979,SECTION XXXIII.,"ignorance. But this is a monkey, volatile by nature, and hath,"
8980,SECTION XXXIII.,"furthermore, been enjoying regal state—why should _he_ not act thus?"
8981,SECTION XXXIII.,Having thus said unto Lakshmana of immeasurable intelligence words
8982,SECTION XXXIII.,"fraught with high import, that female monkey, her eyes drooping with"
8983,SECTION XXXIII.,"languor, again sadly spake in this wise for the behoof of her husband,"
8984,SECTION XXXIII.,"""O foremost of men, although Sugriva has come under the sway of desire,"
8985,SECTION XXXIII.,"he hath, to secure thy good, ere this issued orders for preparations to"
8986,SECTION XXXIII.,"be made. And monkeys by hundreds and thousands and _kotis_, inhabiting"
8987,SECTION XXXIII.,"various mountains, possessed of exceeding prowess, have already arrived"
8988,SECTION XXXIII.,"(here). Do thou therefore, O mighty-armed one, come. (Having rushed"
8989,SECTION XXXIII.,"towards the inner apartment), thou hast not suffered in character. For"
8990,SECTION XXXIII.,"the good to behold others’ wives in a friendly spirit, cannot bring on"
8991,SECTION XXXIII.,"unrighteousness."" Permitted by Tārā, that long-armed repressor of foes,"
8992,SECTION XXXIII.,"urged on by (the required) speed, entered the inner apartment. There"
8993,SECTION XXXIII.,"seated on a superb seat spread with a costly carpet, he found Sugriva"
8994,SECTION XXXIII.,"resembling the sun himself, his person decked with noble ornaments, of a"
8995,SECTION XXXIII.,"dignified presence, famous, wearing gay garlands and attire, invincible"
8996,SECTION XXXIII.,like unto the great Indra. And surrounded by dames adorned with elegant
8997,SECTION XXXIII.,"ornaments and wreaths, Sugriva with his eyes still more reddened in"
8998,SECTION XXXIII.,"wrath, looked like the Destroyer himself. Then deeply embracing Umā, the"
8999,SECTION XXXIII.,"large-eyed hero of the hue of fine gold, seated on an excellent seat,"
9000,SECTION XXXIII.,saw the powerful Saumitri having expansive eyes.

9011,SECTION XXXIV.,"Daçaratha’s son, wroth, and breathing hard, and flaming up in energy,"
9012,SECTION XXXIV.,and burning in consequence of the calamity that had overtaken his
9013,SECTION XXXIV.,"brother, that chief of monkeys started up, leaving his golden seat, like"
9014,SECTION XXXIV.,unto the mighty ornamented standard of the great Indra. And as Sugriva
9015,SECTION XXXIV.,"rose up, Umā and the other females rose up, like unto stars appearing in"
9016,SECTION XXXIV.,"the sky when the full moon has risen. And with eyes reddened, and his"
9017,SECTION XXXIV.,"hands folded, the graceful Sugriva came (before Lakshmana) and stood"
9018,SECTION XXXIV.,there like a mighty Kalpa tree. And the wrathful Lakshmana spake unto
9019,SECTION XXXIV.,"Sugriva stationed among women, having Umā for his second, and resembling"
9020,SECTION XXXIV.,"the moon with the stars, saying,—""The king that is nobly endowed by"
9021,SECTION XXXIV.,"heredity, and is kind, that hath subdued his senses,and is grateful and"
9022,SECTION XXXIV.,"truth-telling, obtains renown in this world. And who is more wicked than"
9023,SECTION XXXIV.,"that king who, rooted in unrighteousness, makes false promises unto"
9024,SECTION XXXIV.,friends intent upon his welfare? He that speaks a falsehood with
9025,SECTION XXXIV.,"reference to a horse, becomes guilty of the deaths of an hundred horses:"
9026,SECTION XXXIV.,"he committing himself to a falsehood relative to a cow, reapeth the"
9027,SECTION XXXIV.,demerit of slaying a thousand kine; while he that uttereth an untruth
9028,SECTION XXXIV.,"touching a person, destroys self as well as his kindred. That ungrateful"
9029,SECTION XXXIV.,"wight that, having at first attained benefit at the hands of his"
9030,SECTION XXXIV.,"friends, doth not requite it, is, O lord of monkeys, worthy of being"
9031,SECTION XXXIV.,"slain by all creatures. Seeing an ingrate wretch, the wrathful Brahmā"
9032,SECTION XXXIV.,"sang the (previous) _sloka_, bowed down unto by all the worlds. Do thou"
9033,SECTION XXXIV.,"understand that, O monkey. The pious provide deliverance for the"
9034,SECTION XXXIV.,"cow-killer, the wine-biber, the thief, and the violator of vows; but for"
9035,SECTION XXXIV.,the ungrateful person there is no deliverance whatever. Thou art ignoble
9036,SECTION XXXIV.,"and ungrateful and lying, O monkey, since, having been formerly"
9037,SECTION XXXIV.,"benefitted by Rāma, thou dost not requite his services. Having been"
9038,SECTION XXXIV.,"benefitted by Rāma, thou, anxious to repay his kindness, shouldst exert"
9039,SECTION XXXIV.,"thyself in search of Sitā. But, of false promises, thou hast been"
9040,SECTION XXXIV.,"indulging in gross enjoyments,—nor doth Rāma know thee for a serpent,"
9041,SECTION XXXIV.,"croaking like a frog.¹²⁹ A sinful wretch and of wicked soul, thou hast"
9042,SECTION XXXIV.,obtained the kingdom of the monkeys through the agency of the eminently

9044,SECTION XXXIV.,"offices rendered unto thee by the high-souled Rāghava; and therefore,"
9045,SECTION XXXIV.,"slain by means of sharpened shafts, thou shalt soon see Vāli. The way"
9046,SECTION XXXIV.,"that hath been wended by the slain Vāli, is not yet narrowed. Do thou, O"
9047,SECTION XXXIV.,"Sugriva, desist in time: do not walk in the wake of Vāli. Do not behold"

9077,SECTION XXXV.,"exigencies, who is fatigued, and who is not satisfied with the pleasures"
9078,SECTION XXXV.,"of Kāma. Nor, O Lakshmana, doth it behove thee, without ascertaining the"
9079,SECTION XXXV.,"exact import of things, to become suddenly subject to wrath, like any"
9080,SECTION XXXV.,"inferior person. O chief of men, persons endowed with the quality of"
9081,SECTION XXXV.,"goodness, like unto thee, do not suffer themselves to come under the"
9082,SECTION XXXV.,"sway of passion, without (at first) needfully revolving matters. I crave"

9085,SECTION XXXV.,"for compassing Rāma’s welfare, Sugriva can resign Umā and myself, and"
9086,SECTION XXXV.,"Angada, and the kingdom and wealth and corn and animals. Slaying that"
9087,SECTION XXXV.,"worst of Rākshasas, Sugriva will bring Rāghava with Sitā, like unto the"
9088,SECTION XXXV.,"moon accompanied by Rohini. Without slaying hundreds, of thousands of"
9089,SECTION XXXV.,"Kotis, and thirty six Ayutas, thousands, and hundreds of irrepressible"
9090,SECTION XXXV.,"Rākshasas wearing shapes at will, (Rāma) can not slay Rāvana, by whom"

9241,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Then Sugriva in a loud voice summoned the foremost monkeys, saying,"
9242,SECTION XXXVIII.,"""Come (hither)."" Hearing his words, those monkeys that could present"

9245,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the Sun, ""Do, ye monkeys, bring hither a car."" bearing his words,"
9246,SECTION XXXVIII.,"monkeys uniting vigor with celerity, brought a car lovely to behold."

9251,SECTION XXXVIII.,"chowris waving around, with conchs and trumpets blowing, eulogized by"
9252,SECTION XXXVIII.,"bards, Sugriva marched out, having obtained supreme regal"
9253,SECTION XXXVIII.,auspiciousness. And surrounded by hundreds of high-spirited apes and
9254,SECTION XXXVIII.,"armed people, he proceeded whither Rāma was staying.— And having arrived"
9255,SECTION XXXVIII.,"at the excellent spot which was the home of Rāma, that highly energetic"
9256,SECTION XXXVIII.,"one alighted from the car along with Lakshmana. And having come to Rāma,"
9257,SECTION XXXVIII.,Sugriva (stood) folding his hands. And when Sugriva had folded his
9258,SECTION XXXVIII.,"hands, the monkeys also did so. And beholding the mighty host of the"
9259,SECTION XXXVIII.,"monkeys resembling a tank filled with lotus buds, Rāma was well-pleased"
9260,SECTION XXXVIII.,with Sugriva. And raising up the monkey-king who had bent his head at
9261,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Rāma’s feet, Rāghava embraced him from love and regard. Having embraced"
9262,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Sugriva, that righteous one said unto him, ""Be seated."" And seeing"
9263,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Sugriva seated on the ground, Rāma said, ""He, O best of monkeys, is a"
9264,SECTION XXXVIII.,"king who, O hero, in season follows righteousness, pleasure and profit,"
9265,SECTION XXXVIII.,"always dividing the same (among all.) He that, renouncing righteousness"
9266,SECTION XXXVIII.,"and the good, devotes himself to pleasure solely, is like a man that"

9438,SECTION XL.,"and the Saraswati, and the Sindhu, and the Sona with water resembling"

9442,SECTION XL.,containing mines of silver; and mountains and cities embosmed in the

9450,SECTION XL.,"that are accessible by crags and bounds,—and the island of Yava, adorned"
9451,SECTION XL.,"by seven several kingdoms, and the island of Suvarna, and"
9452,SECTION XL.,"Rupayaka,—thronged by gold miners. And, going beyond the island of Yava,"
9453,SECTION XL.,"(one comes upon) the hill called Sisira, which pierceth the heavens by"

9455,SECTION XL.,"fastnesses, cascades and woods, do ye together search for the renowned"
9456,SECTION XL.,"wife of Rāma. Then, arriving at the rapid red waters going under the"
9457,SECTION XL.,"name of Sona,and repairing to the other shore of the ocean, the abode of"
9458,SECTION XL.,"Siddhas and Charanas, do ye search all round for Rāvana in company with"
9459,SECTION XL.,Sitā in the sweet sacred spots and picturesque woods. And ye should
9460,SECTION XL.,"explore forests, mountain-sprung streams, wild tracts subject to storms,"
9461,SECTION XL.,and mountains containing caverns. Then it behoves you to examine
9462,SECTION XL.,"horrible ocean islands, heaving with waves, terrific, resounding,—of"
9463,SECTION XL.,"haughty bearing in consequence of winds. There, huge-bodied Asuras,"
9464,SECTION XL.,"hungering for a long period, permitted by Brahma, capture creatures,"
9465,SECTION XL.,"resorting to shades. And adroitly arriving at that great sea, like unto"
9466,SECTION XL.,"clouds at the universal dissolution, inhabited by mighty snakes, sending"
9467,SECTION XL.,"loud sounds,—and there, after passing the terrific sea of red waters"
9468,SECTION XL.,"called Yellow, ye will behold a mighty knarled Sālmali, There, built by"
9469,SECTION XL.,"Viçwakarman, peak-like, gigantic, resembling Kailaça, (towereth) the"
9470,SECTION XL.,"mansion of Vinatā’s offspring, named Mandeha. There, grim Rākshasas"
9471,SECTION XL.,"named Mandehas, resembling hills, of diverse shapes, capable of"
9472,SECTION XL.,"inspiring fear, hang head foremost on the rocks. Day after day at"
9473,SECTION XL.,"sunrise, these Rākshasas heated (by solar rays) and struck dead by"
9474,SECTION XL.,"Brahma energy,¹³⁴ again and again (hang on the crags). Then wilt thou, O"
9475,SECTION XL.,"thou that art hard to repress, proceeding, view the sea named Kshiroda,"
9476,SECTION XL.,"having the hue of pale clouds, and looking like a necklace, because of"
9477,SECTION XL.,the ripples (on its surface). In it there are the mighty white mountains
9478,SECTION XL.,"going by the name of Rishada, covered with trees bearing oderous"
9479,SECTION XL.,"blossoms; as well as the tank known under the name of Sudarçana,"
9480,SECTION XL.,swarming with swans and shining silver lotuses having golden filaments.
9481,SECTION XL.,"Desirous of sport, resort to this tank delighted troops of Vivudhas and"
9482,SECTION XL.,"Chāranas, Yakshas, Kinnaras and Apsarās. Leaving behind Kshiroda, ye"
9483,SECTION XL.,"monkeys, ye will soon after behold the Jalada sea, striking terror into"
9484,SECTION XL.,"all beings. There presideth that mighty ire-born Energy of him,¹³⁵"
9485,SECTION XL.,(embodied in) the mouth of a mule. This wondrous (universe) containing
9486,SECTION XL.,"mobile and immobile things and fraught with great impetus, is the"
9487,SECTION XL.,aliment of this Energy. There are heard the cries of feeble creatures
9488,SECTION XL.,"inhabiting the sea, who began to wail on witnessing the mouth of the"
9489,SECTION XL.,"mule. On the north of the Swādu sea, lie thirteen _yojanas_ (of land),"
9490,SECTION XL.,"named Jātarupaçila,¹³⁶ exceeding spacious, and of the splendour of gold."
9491,SECTION XL.,"There, ye monkeys, ye will behold that serpent, the holder of"
9492,SECTION XL.,"Earth—resembling the moon, and with expansive eyes like"
9493,SECTION XL.,"lotus-petals—seated at the summit of the mount,— that one worshipped of"
9494,SECTION XL.,"all deities, having a thousand heads,— the god Ananta, clad in blue"
9495,SECTION XL.,apparel. And by the dais (there) at the top of the mount is the golden
9496,SECTION XL.,"palm, planted by that high souled one,—which is like a banner. The chief"
9497,SECTION XL.,of the celestials reared it in the Eastern region. After that is the
9498,SECTION XL.,"fair Rising mountain. Its golden peak measuring a hundred _yojanas_,"
9499,SECTION XL.,"reaching unto the heavens, rises nobly, with mountains at its base; and"
9500,SECTION XL.,"looks beautiful with Sālas, palms, Tamālas, and flowering"
9501,SECTION XL.,"Karnikāras,—golden, splendid and resembling the sun. There,¹³⁷ spreading"
9502,SECTION XL.,"a _yojana_ around, towering up ten, is the peak named Saumanasa—all"
9503,SECTION XL.,"certainly of gold. There, formerly on the occasion of invading the earth"
9504,SECTION XL.,"with three paces, that foremost of persons, Vishnu, planting his first"
9505,SECTION XL.,"foot, planted the other on the summit of Meru. The sun, having passed by"
9506,SECTION XL.,"Jamvudwipa on the north, and, arriving at that mighty and eminent"
9507,SECTION XL.,"summit, (Saumanasa), again becometh visible to the dwellers of"
9508,SECTION XL.,"Jamvudwipa. There are seen those Vālakhilya Maharshis, named"
9509,SECTION XL.,"Vaikhānasas,—wearing the hue of the sun, leading an ascetic mode of"
9510,SECTION XL.,"life. This is the island of Sudarçana, before which all creatures"
9511,SECTION XL.,inspire energy and have their sight granted to them. You should search
9512,SECTION XL.,for Rāvana with Vaidehi all round the top of that mountain as well as in
9513,SECTION XL.,its forests and woods. (Here) the first twilight enfolded in the glory
9514,SECTION XL.,"of the golden hill and that of the high-souled Sun, appeareth roseate."
9515,SECTION XL.,"As this is the first gateway of both Earth and Heaven, and as the sun"

9517,SECTION XL.,"the breast of its mountain, and fountains, and caves for Rāvana in"
9518,SECTION XL.,"company with Vaidehi. Beyond that, is the exceedingly impassable Eastern"
9519,SECTION XL.,"quarter, thronged by the celestials,—covered with darkness and devoid of"

9548,SECTION XLI.,the South others competent to perform tlie several tasks entrusted to
9549,SECTION XLI.,them. And appointing the exceedingly mighty Angada as the leader of
9550,SECTION XLI.,"those heroic monkeys, that hero, the lord of monkey bands, conversant"
9551,SECTION XLI.,"with the countries intended to be explored, despatched heroes endowed"
9552,SECTION XLI.,"with speed and prowess, headed by Angada, Nila the son of Fire, and the"
9553,SECTION XLI.,"monkey Hanumān, and the exceedingly energetic Jambavān, son unto the"

9557,SECTION XLI.,"describe unto the monkey-chiefs those tracts in those directions, that"
9558,SECTION XLI.,"were difficult of access. ""Ye will behold Vindhya having an hundred"
9559,SECTION XLI.,"summits, and brushed with various trees and shrubs, and the romantic"
9560,SECTION XLI.,"river Narmada, frequented by mighty serpents; and the Godāvari,¹³⁸ and"
9561,SECTION XLI.,"that mighty river, the captivating Krishnaveni, and the Mekhalas and"

9565,SECTION XLI.,"Dandaka, with mountains, rivers and caverns; and the river Godāvari,¹⁴⁰"
9566,SECTION XLI.,"and the Andhras, and Paundras, the Cholas, the Pandyas, and the Keralas."
9567,SECTION XLI.,"Then shall ye repair to the mountain Ayomukha,¹⁴¹ plated with ore,"
9568,SECTION XLI.,"having taking summits, graceful, furnished with picturesque flowering"
9569,SECTION XLI.,"woods,— the mighty mountain having groves of excellent sandal. At the"
9570,SECTION XLI.,"foot of the Malaya mountain endeued with exceeding energy, ye will"
9571,SECTION XLI.,"behold the noble stream Kāveri, of pleasant waters, where sport troops"
9572,SECTION XLI.,"of Apsarās. (There) you will see that foremost of saints, Agastya,"
9573,SECTION XLI.,"resembling the sun. Permitted by that gratified high-souled one, ye will"
9574,SECTION XLI.,"cross over the great river, Tāmraparni, abounding in alligators. Like a"
9575,SECTION XLI.,"youthful female in relation to her lover, she (Tāmraparni), with both"
9576,SECTION XLI.,"her waters as well as islets concealed under beautiful sandal woods,"
9577,SECTION XLI.,"bathes in the sea. Proceeding (therefrom), the monkeys shall see the"
9578,SECTION XLI.,grand golden gates belonging to the walls of the capital of the Pāndyas.
9579,SECTION XLI.,"Then arriving at the main, ye shall ascertain your ability or otherwise"
9580,SECTION XLI.,"of crossing the same. In the bosom of the deep there, Agastya hath"
9581,SECTION XLI.,"placed that foremost of mountains—the charming Mahendra, having"
9582,SECTION XLI.,"picturesque plateaus; golden, and beautiful,—with a portion of it sunk"
9583,SECTION XLI.,"in the great ocean. For aye, He of a thousand eyes at _Parvas_ visiteth"
9584,SECTION XLI.,this mountain embellished by various blossoming trees and creepers;
9585,SECTION XLI.,"beauteous with divinities, and saints, and the foremost Yakshas and"
9586,SECTION XLI.,Apsarās; thronged by numbers of Siddhas and Charanas; and of surpassing
9587,SECTION XLI.,loveliness. On its other shore is an island extending over an hundred
9588,SECTION XLI.,"_yojanas_, inaccessible to men¹⁴² and of splendid aspect. Do ye explore"
9589,SECTION XLI.,"it all round. There, in particular, ye must every way search for Sitā."
9590,SECTION XLI.,"That country belongs to the impious Rāvana, worthy of being slain—the"
9591,SECTION XLI.,"lord of Rākshasas, like unto the thousand-eyed (deity) in splendour. In"
9592,SECTION XLI.,"the midst of the Southern sea belonging to him (Rāvana), there is a"
9593,SECTION XLI.,"Rākshasi, named Angā, who procureth her prey by casting her shadow."
9594,SECTION XLI.,Having (by your search) satisfied yourselves as to those countries where
9595,SECTION XLI.,"ye might suspect Sitā to be, do ye, your doubts dispelled, proceeding"
9596,SECTION XLI.,"beyond that, (Lankā), search for the spouse of that monarch endeued with"
9597,SECTION XLI.,"unbounded energy. In the sea extending over an hundred _yojanas_, a"
9598,SECTION XLI.,"lovely hill, named Pushpitaka, the abode of Siddhas and Chāranas;"
9599,SECTION XLI.,"resembling the rays of the sun or the moon,— resting on the waters of"
9600,SECTION XLI.,"the ocean, looks splendid, piercing the heavens with its giant peaks. Of"
9601,SECTION XLI.,"this (mountain), there is a particular golden summit, which the sun"
9602,SECTION XLI.,approaches. It is incapable of being beheld by the ungrateful or the
9603,SECTION XLI.,"atheistical. Bowing your heads down unto this hill, let the monkeys"
9604,SECTION XLI.,"search on. Leaving behind that irrepressible one, (ye will come upon) a"
9605,SECTION XLI.,"mountain difficult of approach, extending over fourteen _yojanas_, named"
9606,SECTION XLI.,"Suryyavān. Passing by that also, (ye will see) a mountain, named Vidyut,"
9607,SECTION XLI.,"filled with trees, beautiful at all seasons, and bearing all desirable"
9608,SECTION XLI.,"fruits. There, feeding upon excellent and costly fruits and roots, and"
9609,SECTION XLI.,"drinking delicious honey, let the monkeys pass beyond it. There is the"
9610,SECTION XLI.,"hill named Kunjara, grateful both to the eye and the mind,—where"
9611,SECTION XLI.,Viçwakarmā had built the abode of Agastya.¹⁴³ There (rises) that stately
9612,SECTION XLI.,"golden pile, adorned with various gems, extending over one _yojana_, and"
9613,SECTION XLI.,"ten in height. In it¹⁴⁴ also there is that palace, which is the abode of"
9614,SECTION XLI.,"snakes; having spacious ways, incapable of being captured, guarded"
9615,SECTION XLI.,"around, and protected by dreadful snakes and sharp-toothed serpents of"
9616,SECTION XLI.,"virulent poison; where dwelleth Vāsuki, the exceedingly terrible king of"
9617,SECTION XLI.,"snakes. Proceeding heedfully, ye must explore that Bhogavati palace; as"
9618,SECTION XLI.,"also whatever concealed places may lie there. Going beyond that place,"
9619,SECTION XLI.,"(ye will see) the mighty mountain named Rhrishava, in the form of a"
9620,SECTION XLI.,"bull, full of all gems, and possessed of grace,— where are produced"
9621,SECTION XLI.,"excellent _Goçirshaka_, _Padmaka_, and _Haricyāma_ sandals, and which in"
9622,SECTION XLI.,"effulgence resembles fire. But, seeing that sandal, ye must by no means"
9623,SECTION XLI.,"ask any questions: certain Gandharbas, named Rohitas, are on guard over"
9624,SECTION XLI.,"that wood—the lords of Gandharbas, in splendour like unto five"
9625,SECTION XLI.,"suns,—Cailusha, Grāmani, Ciksha, Cuka, and Babhru. After that,"
9626,SECTION XLI.,"(Rhishava), at the extremity of the Earth is the abode of persons of"
9627,SECTION XLI.,"pious acts, whose bodies are composed of the Sun, the Moon and Fire. And"
9628,SECTION XLI.,there reside persons who have won the heavenly regions. After that are
9629,SECTION XLI.,"the awful regions of the ancestral manes, which ye must not approach."
9630,SECTION XLI.,"This is the metropolis of Yama, covered by deep gloom. Ye heroic monkey"
9631,SECTION XLI.,"chiefs, ye can seek thus far. Further there is no course for those"
9632,SECTION XLI.,"endeued with motion. Having examined all these, as well others that may"
9633,SECTION XLI.,"come within your ken, it behoves you, after having ascertained Vaidehi’s"
9634,SECTION XLI.,"course, to return (hither). He that, returning within a month, shall"
9635,SECTION XLI.,"say,—""I have seen Sitā,"" shall pass his days in happiness, enjoying"
9636,SECTION XLI.,affluence like mine own and indulging all pleasures. He shall be dearer
9637,SECTION XLI.,"unto me than life itself, and none dearer (unto me) than he; and"
9638,SECTION XLI.,"although he might commit innumerable wrongs, still should he become my"

9683,SECTION XLII.,"mountain ranges, and extremely difficult of access,—and proceeding at a"
9684,SECTION XLII.,"little more to the west, it behoves you to have a view of the sea. And"
9685,SECTION XLII.,"proceeding on, ye monkeys, ye shall see (the ocean), whose waters abound"
9686,SECTION XLII.,"in whales and alligators, ye monkeys.¹⁴⁷ Then the apes shall sport in"
9687,SECTION XLII.,"tracts covered by _Ketakas_, and dense with _Tomālas_ and woods of"

9690,SECTION XLII.,"and the delightful Jatāpura, and Avanti, and Angalapā, as well as in the"
9691,SECTION XLII.,"wood (called) Alakshita, and spacious monarchies, and emporiums. There"
9692,SECTION XLII.,"is a mighty mountain where the Sindhu falls into the sea, Somagiri by"
9693,SECTION XLII.,name; having an hundred summits and tall trees. In its plateaus there
9694,SECTION XLII.,are certain birds (called) Sinhas. These lift up to their nests whales

9699,SECTION XLII.,swiftly search its golden summit towering to the sky and filled with
9700,SECTION XLII.,"graceful trees. Proceeding further, the monkeys shall behold the golden"
9701,SECTION XLII.,summit of Pāriyātra rising from the sea and extending over an hundred
9702,SECTION XLII.,_yojanas_. There dwell all around in a body four and twenty _kotis_ of
9703,SECTION XLII.,"ascetic Gandharbas, resembling fire, dreadful, practicising impiety, and"
9704,SECTION XLII.,like unto flames of fire. The monkeys of dreadful prowess should not

9706,SECTION XLII.,that country. Those heroes are hard to approach; and they are truthful
9707,SECTION XLII.,and possessed of great might. And there they of dreadful prowess stow
9708,SECTION XLII.,away their fruits and roots. There ye should needfully search for
9709,SECTION XLII.,Jānaki. Ye have no fear whatever from them; do ye only follow your
9710,SECTION XLII.,"native nature as monkeys. There, in hue like lapises, abounding in"
9711,SECTION XLII.,"various kinds of trees and plants, is a mighty hill of an adamantine"
9712,SECTION XLII.,"basis, called Vajra; beautiful, famous, and measuring an hundred"

9714,SECTION XLII.,the caves. On the fourth side of the Ocean is a mountain named
9715,SECTION XLII.,Chakravān. There Viçwakarmā forged the discus (called) _Sahasrāra_.
9716,SECTION XLII.,"There, slaying Panchajana and the Dānava, Hayagriva,¹⁴⁸ the Best of male"

9720,SECTION XLII.,"mountain named Varāha, having golden peaks and measuring four and sixty"
9721,SECTION XLII.,"_yojanas._ In it is a city named Prāgjyotisha, all of gold. There dwells"
9722,SECTION XLII.,the wicked Dānava named Naraka.¹⁴⁹ There do ye everywhere search for

9733,SECTION XLII.,sides and embellished by blossoming golden trees. In the midst of them
9734,SECTION XLII.,"is established as king, Meru, best of mountains. Formerly the Sun being"
9735,SECTION XLII.,"well pleased, conferred a boon on this mountain, and he addressed the"
9736,SECTION XLII.,"mountain, saying,—’By my grace all the hills that are under thy"
9737,SECTION XLII.,"protection, shall be golden day and night; and also those gods"
9738,SECTION XLII.,"Gandharbas and Dānavas that shall dwell in thee, shall be filled with"

9740,SECTION XLII.,"excellent mountain Meru, Viçwadevas, the Vasus, the Maruts and the"
9741,SECTION XLII.,"celestials, adore the Sun in the western twilight. Adored by them, the"
9742,SECTION XLII.,"Sun, becoming invisible, repaireth to the Setting hill.¹⁵⁰ In half a"
9743,SECTION XLII.,"_muhurta_, the Sun swiftly passes over this (mountain), measuring, as it"
9744,SECTION XLII.,"does, ten thousand _yojanas_. On its peak rises an edifice; resembling"
9745,SECTION XLII.,the sun (in splendour); consisting of palatial mansions built by
9746,SECTION XLII.,"Viçwakarmā; and graced by goodly trees rife with various birds,—the"
9747,SECTION XLII.,"residence of the high-souled Varuna, bearing the noose in his hand."
9748,SECTION XLII.,"Between Meru and the Setting hill, towers a tall palm having ten heads."
9749,SECTION XLII.,"Golden and graceful, it shineth on a variegated dais. In all these,"
9750,SECTION XLII.,"difficult of access, as also in rivers and tanks, ye should thoroughly"
9751,SECTION XLII.,search for Rāvana along with Vaidehi. There dwells there the righteous
9752,SECTION XLII.,"and famous Merusāvarni, sanctified by virtue of his own asceticism, and"
9753,SECTION XLII.,"like unto Brahmā, himself.¹⁵¹ Bowing down your heads to the earth, ye"
9754,SECTION XLII.,"should ask the Maharshi Merusāvarni, resembling the sun, touching"
9755,SECTION XLII.,"Mithilā’s daughter. On the departure of night, the sun dispells the"
9756,SECTION XLII.,"darkness of the world to this extent, and then enters the Setting hill."
9757,SECTION XLII.,"Ye foremost of monkeys, the monkeys are able to proceed thus far. Beyond"
9758,SECTION XLII.,"this, of what is sunless and boundless I know nothing. Having come to"
9759,SECTION XLII.,"Vaidehi and Rāvana’s mansions, and arrived at the Setting-hill, do ye"
9760,SECTION XLII.,return on the month being complete. Ye must not stay above a month; and
9761,SECTION XLII.,"if ye do, ye must be slain by me. And along with you goeth that hero, my"

9765,SECTION XLII.,certainly constitute the measure whereby to ascertain the wisdom or

9837,SECTION XLIII.,"by troops of Apsarās. There king Vaiçravana, the lord of Yakshas, bowed"
9838,SECTION XLIII.,"down unto by all creatures,—the graceful giver of riches—sporteth along"
9839,SECTION XLIII.,with the Guhyakas. In the offshoots belonging to Kailāça resembling the
9840,SECTION XLIII.,"moon, as also in their caverns,do ye thoroughly search for Rāvana in"
9841,SECTION XLIII.,"company with Vaidehi. And coming to the Krauncha mountain,ye"
9842,SECTION XLIII.,"shou1d,having your wits about you, enter its inaccessible cavern; for"
9843,SECTION XLIII.,that is well known as difficult of entrance. There dwell certain
9844,SECTION XLIII.,"Maharshis, high-souled, of effulgence resembling that of the"
9845,SECTION XLIII.,"sun—complete god-like shapes,—who are sought by the deities themselves."
9846,SECTION XLIII.,"And ye should thoroughly explore the other caves of Krauncha, its"
9847,SECTION XLIII.,plateaus and peaks; its passes and sides. (Then is) the treeless
9848,SECTION XLIII.,Mānasa—abode of birds—the scene of Kāma’s austerities. Way there is none
9849,SECTION XLIII.,"for creatures, or for gods, or for Rākshasas. That also must be explored"
9850,SECTION XLIII.,"by you,—that mountain with plains and plateaus. Going beyond Krauncha,"
9851,SECTION XLIII.,"(ye shall see) the mountain, named Maināka. There is the residence of"
9852,SECTION XLIII.,"the Dānava, Maya, reared by himself. Maināka also with its plains,"
9853,SECTION XLIII.,"plateaus and woods must be searched by you. There are all over, the"
9854,SECTION XLIII.,homes of females with faces resembling those of horses. Going beyond
9855,SECTION XLIII.,"that part, (ye shall come to) the asylum inhabited by Siddhas; where are"
9856,SECTION XLIII.,"ascetics—Vālakhilyas, Siddhas and Vaikhānasas. Saluting those Siddhas,"
9857,SECTION XLIII.,"who have been cleansed of their sins on account of their asceticism, ye"
9858,SECTION XLIII.,should in humble guise ask them concerning Sitā. There is the Vaikhānasa
9859,SECTION XLIII.,tank filled with golden lotuses; and ranged by graceful cranes of the
9860,SECTION XLIII.,"hue of the infant sun. Kuvera’s vehicle, the elephant known (by the name"
9861,SECTION XLIII.,"of) Sārvabhauma, ever rangeth that country in company with"
9862,SECTION XLIII.,"she-elephants. Going beyond that expanse of water, (ye come upon) a sky"
9863,SECTION XLIII.,"void of stars, and where the sun and the moon have been put out; and"
9864,SECTION XLIII.,"that land is visible by the rays, as if of the sun, proceeding from (the"
9865,SECTION XLIII.,"persons of) self-luminous, god-like ones, who are reposing there, after"
9866,SECTION XLIII.,"achieving success in austerities. Leaving behind that region, (you come"
9867,SECTION XLIII.,to) a stream named Sailodā. On its both banks are bamboos named Kichaka.
9868,SECTION XLIII.,These take the Siddhas to the other shore and bring them back again.
9869,SECTION XLIII.,"There (are seen) the northern Kurus, the abode of those that have"
9870,SECTION XLIII.,acquired religious merit. And there are tanks there with their waters
9871,SECTION XLIII.,crowned with golden lotuses. There are rivers by thousands with copious
9872,SECTION XLIII.,"blue lapis leaves. And the pools here,resembling the tender sun, are"
9873,SECTION XLIII.,embellished with assemblages of golden red lotuses. And that tract is
9874,SECTION XLIII.,"every where filled with costly gems, and jewels, and woods of blue"

9877,SECTION XLIII.,"are crowded with lovely hills of gold, bright as fire, furnished with"
9878,SECTION XLIII.,"all kinds of precious stones. And the trees there, thronged with birds,"
9879,SECTION XLIII.,"bear flowers and fruits daily; and, charged with savoury juices,"
9880,SECTION XLIII.,"publishing superb perfumes, and of delicious feel, they confer every"
9881,SECTION XLIII.,"wish. Other excellent trees bring forth attires of divers kinds, and"
9882,SECTION XLIII.,"ornaments decked with pearls and lapises,—coveted alike by males and"
9883,SECTION XLIII.,females¹⁵³. And other excellent trees bear fruits fit to be partaken at
9884,SECTION XLIII.,all seasons. And other excellent trees bring forth precious beds dight
9885,SECTION XLIII.,with costly jewels and furnished with variegated covers. And other trees
9886,SECTION XLIII.,"bring forth charming wreaths, and costly drinks, and various kinds of"
9887,SECTION XLIII.,"viands. And females adorned with every accomplishment, and endowed with"
9888,SECTION XLIII.,"youth and beauty, and Gandharbas and Kinnaras, and Siddhas and Nāgas and"
9889,SECTION XLIII.,"Vidyādharas, of blazing splendour, ceaselessly sport there in company"
9890,SECTION XLIII.,"with females. And all of righteous deeds, and all engaged in amorous"
9891,SECTION XLIII.,"disports, and all furnished with desire and profit,—dwell in that place"
9892,SECTION XLIII.,in association with their females. And there are continually heard there
9893,SECTION XLIII.,the sounds of instruments and the voice of song mixed with sweet
9894,SECTION XLIII.,"hilarous laughter, capable of taking all creatures. No one is depressed"
9895,SECTION XLIII.,there; nor doth any one there want any desirable object; and day after
9896,SECTION XLIII.,day the delightful qualities find their developement there. Passing
9897,SECTION XLIII.,beyond that is the Northern ocean. In the bosom (of the deep) is the

10155,SECTION XLVIII.,"had been searched all through, the dwellers of the woods entered another"
10156,SECTION XLVIII.,"fearful mountain cavern. And after having searched (that place) also,"

10444,SECTION LIII.,Therefore even on this sacred shore of the sea shall I sit down to

10446,SECTION LIII.,"principal monkeys pathetically observed,— “Sugriva is harsh by nature,"
10447,SECTION LIII.,"and Rāghava loveth his wife dearly. The time appointed having passed by,"
10448,SECTION LIII.,"seeing us (come) without attaining success in the task, and seeing us"
10449,SECTION LIII.,"arrive without obtaining a sight of Vaidehi, (Sugriva) shall certainly"
10450,SECTION LIII.,slay us from the desire of doing what is agreeable to Rāghava. Those who
10451,SECTION LIII.,"have transgressed, cannot come to the side of their master. Having come"
10452,SECTION LIII.,"hither as the principal servants of Sugriva, we shall either see Sitā or"
10453,SECTION LIII.,"obtain information concerning her, or else, O hero, we shall repair to"
10454,SECTION LIII.,the mansion of Yama.” Hearing the speeches of the monkeys afflicted with
10455,SECTION LIII.,"fear, Tāra said,—""No use of indulging in grief. If ye relish it, let us"
10456,SECTION LIII.,"all entering the cave, dwell there. This place abounding in flowers and"
10457,SECTION LIII.,"waters, meats and drinks,— which hath been brought forth by the power of"
10458,SECTION LIII.,"illusion, is incapable of being approached. Here we have no fear from"
10459,SECTION LIII.,"Purandara, or Rāghava, or the king of monkeys.” Hearing the welcome"
10460,SECTION LIII.,"words of Angada, the monkeys, being convinced, said,—“Do thou this very"

10476,SECTION LIV.,"When Tāra, bright as the moon, had spoken thus, Hanumān felt as if"

10478,SECTION LIV.,Vāli’s son as endowed with intelligence consisting of eight elements;

10486,SECTION LIV.,"under contribution the second of the four means,¹⁷⁴ had created division"

10490,SECTION LIV.,fight than even thy sire; and thou art also able to hold the
10491,SECTION LIV.,"monkey-kingdom as firmly as he. But, O foremost of monkeys, the monkeys"
10492,SECTION LIV.,"are always inconstant in character. Bereft of their wives and sons, they"
10493,SECTION LIV.,shall not bear thy behest. And they shall never take to thee. This I
10494,SECTION LIV.,tell thee in presence of all. And I will tell thee what. Thou neither by
10495,SECTION LIV.,"the virtues of conciliation, charity and the rest, nor by chastisement,"
10496,SECTION LIV.,"shalt succeed in drawing to thy side this Jāmbavān, or Nila, or the"
10497,SECTION LIV.,"mighty ape Suhotra, or myself. A strong one wronging another that is"
10498,SECTION LIV.,"weak, can live; therefore a weak person anxious for self-preservation,"
10499,SECTION LIV.,should never wrong (a strong individual). Thou considerest that this
10500,SECTION LIV.,"cave may serve for thy protectress,¹⁷⁵ having heard of it (said by"
10501,SECTION LIV.,Tāra); but to rive the same is but light work for the shafts of
10502,SECTION LIV.,"Lakshmana. Formerly this was cleft a little by Indra, with his"
10503,SECTION LIV.,thunderbolt hurled (against it)¹⁷⁶; but now Lakshmana would pierce it
10504,SECTION LIV.,"like a leaf-stalk, by means of his keen arrows. Lakshmana hath many an"
10505,SECTION LIV.,"iron arrow like Indra’s thunderbolt or that of the sky,¹⁷⁷ capable of"
10506,SECTION LIV.,"riving even mountains. O subduer of enemies, soon as thou shalt set up"

10508,SECTION LIV.,"Remembering their wives and sons, ever anxious (on account of Sugriva),"
10509,SECTION LIV.,"pining for domestic happiness, and aggrieved (at their pitiable plight),"
10510,SECTION LIV.,they shall turn their backs upon thee. Then forsaken by thy kindred as
10511,SECTION LIV.,"well as friends seeking thy welfare, thou shalt be struck with affright"
10512,SECTION LIV.,"even at a quaking blade of grass. If thou make head (against Sugriva),"
10513,SECTION LIV.,"the sharpened shafts of Lakshmana, terrible, of exceeding impetuosity"

10516,SECTION LIV.,"(before him) along with us, he shall establish thee in the kingdom, in"
10517,SECTION LIV.,"consideration of thy being the next heir. A righteous sovereign, steady"
10518,SECTION LIV.,"in vow, clean, and truthful in promise, thy uncle, who cherishes"

10552,SECTION LV.,"that, while her son is living, appropriateth the beloved queen of his"

10562,SECTION LV.,"soul who hath run amuck of morality? Meritorious or otherwise, how can"
10563,SECTION LV.,"Sugriva, having installed in the kingdom me, son (of his enemy) and the"
10564,SECTION LV.,"enemy sprung in his race,—suffer me to live? How can I, whose counsels"
10565,SECTION LV.,"have been revealed, who have transgressed, and who have been deprived of"
10566,SECTION LV.,"my power, repairing to Kishkindhā like one forlorn and feeble, live? For"
10567,SECTION LV.,"the sake of his kingdom, Sugriva, wily, cunning and cruel, shall put me"
10568,SECTION LV.,in solitary confinement. For me fasting to death is better than being
10569,SECTION LV.,confined and suffering the consequent misery. Do ye grant me your
10570,SECTION LV.,"permision; and go to your homes, ye monkeys. I vow before you, to the"
10571,SECTION LV.,palace I will never repair. At this very spot will I fast for death; as
10572,SECTION LV.,death is good for me. Bowing unto the king as well as unto the powerful
10573,SECTION LV.,"Rāghava, ye should communicate my well-being unto Sugriva—lord of"
10574,SECTION LV.,apes—and my health and peace unto my mother Uma. And it behoves you also
10575,SECTION LV.,"to console my mother, Tārā. Naturally fond of her son, and overflowing"
10576,SECTION LV.,"with tenderness, that lorn one, hearing of my death at this place, shall"
10577,SECTION LV.,"certainly renounce her life."" Having said this, Angada, saluting the"
10578,SECTION LV.,"elders, with a woebegone face entered the earth covered with grass. When"
10579,SECTION LV.,"he had entered, those foremost monkeys, stricken with sorrow, weeping"
10580,SECTION LV.,shed warm tears from their eyes. And censuring Sugriva and praising
10581,SECTION LV.,"Vāli, they, surrounding Angada, determined to starve themselves to"
10582,SECTION LV.,"death. Taking to heart the speech of Vāli’s son, those prime monkeys,"
10583,SECTION LV.,"sipping water, sat down facing the East. And sitting on the edge of the"
10584,SECTION LV.,"water on grass pointing to the south, the foremost monkeys, wishing for"
10585,SECTION LV.,"surcease, thought within themselves,—""Even this is fit for us."" And as"
10586,SECTION LV.,"they spoke of the exile of Rāma and the demise of Daçaratha, the carnage"
10587,SECTION LV.,"in Janasthāna, the slaying of Jatāyu, the ravishment of Vaidehi, the"
10588,SECTION LV.,"slaughter of Vāli, and the ire of Rāma, the monkeys were seized with"
10589,SECTION LV.,"fear. When those monkeys resembling mountain-summits had entered in,"
10590,SECTION LV.,"they set up cries, which, like unto the rumbling of clouds, making the"
10591,SECTION LV.,"sky resound, made that mountain with its rills reverberate."

10600,SECTION LVI.,happened to come to that quarter. And that long-lived bird was named
10601,SECTION LVI.,"Sampāti, the beautiful brother of Jatāyu, famous for his strength and"
10602,SECTION LVI.,"prowess. Issuing from a cavern of the mighty mountain Vindhya, he,"
10603,SECTION LVI.,"seeing the monkeys seated, well pleased, said— ""Verily man¹⁷⁸ reapeth"

10605,SECTION LVI.,"ordained to that end, comes to me after a long time. I shall feed on"
10606,SECTION LVI.,"these monkeys, one by one, slaying them one after another."" Eying those"
10607,SECTION LVI.,"apes, the bird expressed himself thus. Hearing this speech of the bird"
10608,SECTION LVI.,"coveting his food, Angada faintly spoke to Hanumān, ""Behold! through"
10609,SECTION LVI.,"Sitā’s simplicity¹⁷⁹ this one—the very son of the Sun, Yama—hath come to"
10610,SECTION LVI.,"this place, to exterminate the monkeys. Rāma’s work hath not been done;"

10612,SECTION LVI.,"the monkeys. Ye have in detail heard all that, inspired with the desire"
10613,SECTION LVI.,"of doing what is good unto Vaidehi, that king of vultures, Jatāyu, did"
10614,SECTION LVI.,"here. In this way, all creatures, even the brute species, compass the"
10615,SECTION LVI.,"welfare of Rāma, renouncing their lives, as we do. It is because of the"
10616,SECTION LVI.,"love and tenderness¹⁸⁰ they bear towards (Rāma), that people do good"
10617,SECTION LVI.,"unto each other. And therefore the righteous Jatāyu, of his own accord"
10618,SECTION LVI.,"laying down his life, hath done the pleasure of Rāma. We also, overcome"
10619,SECTION LVI.,"with fatigue and (almost) dying, have come to this forest; but Mithilā’s"
10620,SECTION LVI.,"daughter we find not. Happy is that king of vultures, having been slain"
10621,SECTION LVI.,"by Rāvana in battle. He hath got quit of the fear of Sugriva, and hath"
10622,SECTION LVI.,also attained supreme state. In consequence of the death of Jatāyu and
10623,SECTION LVI.,"that of king Daçaratha, as well as owing to the ravishment of Vaidehi,"
10624,SECTION LVI.,(the lives of) the monkeys have come into jeopardy. Rāma’s and
10625,SECTION LVI.,"Lakshmana’s abode in the forest with Sitā, Rāghava’s slaying of Vāli"
10626,SECTION LVI.,"with a shaft, the slaughter of innumerable Rākshasas by the enraged"
10627,SECTION LVI.,"Rāma, and (finally) this mishap—all these owe their orgin to the"
10628,SECTION LVI.,"bestowal of the boon on Kaikeyi."" Seeing the monkeys stretched on the"
10629,SECTION LVI.,"earth, and hearing their piteous words describing their grief, that"
10630,SECTION LVI.,"magnanimous king of vultures, with his mind agitated, said (this). And"
10631,SECTION LVI.,"hearing the words that issued from Angada’s mouth, the sharp-beaked and"
10632,SECTION LVI.,"high-toned vulture, said,— ""Who is it that, making my mind tremble,"
10633,SECTION LVI.,"speaketh of the death of my brother, Jatāyu, dearer unto me than life?"
10634,SECTION LVI.,How happened in Janasthāna the fight between the Rākshasa and the
10635,SECTION LVI.,vulture? It is after a long time that to-day I hear the name of my

10638,SECTION LVI.,"of my younger brother, cognizant of qualities and worthy of being"
10639,SECTION LVI.,"extolled by reason of his prowess. Ye foremost of monkeys, I wish to"

10641,SECTION LVI.,"could Daçaratha, whose beloved eldest son is Rāma, dear unto his"
10642,SECTION LVI.,"superiors, be the friend of my brother? I can not move in consequence of"
10643,SECTION LVI.,my wings having been burnt by the solar rays. But I wish that ye may

10672,SECTION LVII.,"monarch of all this earth, descendant of the Ikshwākus, the great and"
10673,SECTION LVII.,"graceful car-warrior, Rāma, son unto Daçaratha, intent upon the"

10675,SECTION LVII.,"the woods of Dandaka in company with his brother, Lakshmana and his wife"
10676,SECTION LVII.,Vaidehi. And his spouse was forcibly carried away from Janasthāna. And
10677,SECTION LVII.,"the friend of Rāma’s father, the king of vultures, named Jatāyu, saw"
10678,SECTION LVII.,"Videha’s daughter, Sitā, as she was being carried away in the sky. And"
10679,SECTION LVII.,"after having thrown down Rāvana from his car, and placed Maithili on the"
10680,SECTION LVII.,"ground, (that vulture) old and overcome with fatigue was (at length)"

10683,SECTION LVII.,"hath attained excellent state. Then Rāghava made friends with my uncle,"
10684,SECTION LVII.,the high-souled Sugriva; and he also slew my sire. My father had
10685,SECTION LVII.,"debarred Sugriva from the kingdom along with his counsellors; but Rāma,"
10686,SECTION LVII.,"having slain Vāli, installed him (Sugriva). And established in the"
10687,SECTION LVII.,"monarchy by him (Rāma), Sugriva is (now) the master of the monkeys and"

10742,SECTION LVIII.,"your relation of Rāma, I conclude that she must be Sitā. Now listen to"
10743,SECTION LVIII.,me as I tell you about the abode of that Rākshasa. Son unto Viçravana
10744,SECTION LVIII.,"and brother unto Vaiçravana, the Rākshasa named Rāvana resides in the"
10745,SECTION LVIII.,"city of Lankā. And the lovely city of Lankā, reared by Viçwakarma, lieth"
10746,SECTION LVIII.,a full hundred _yojanas_ hence on an island in the sea; furnished with
10747,SECTION LVIII.,"golden gateways, filled with variegated daises, lordly gold-gleaming"
10748,SECTION LVIII.,palaces; and girt round with great walls hued like sunshine. There
10749,SECTION LVIII.,"stayeth Vaidehi, forlorn and clad in a silken cloth,—confined in the"
10750,SECTION LVIII.,"inner apartment of Rāvana, and carefully guarded by Rākshasis. In Lankā"
10751,SECTION LVIII.,"protected all round by the sea, ye shall behold Janaka’s daughter,"
10752,SECTION LVIII.,"Maithili. At the end of the ocean after a full hundered _yojanas_,"
10753,SECTION LVIII.,"arriving at its southern shore, ye shall see Rāvana. Ye monkeys, do ye"
10754,SECTION LVIII.,hie thither speedily with vigor. I perceive by my knowledge that having
10755,SECTION LVIII.,"seen (that place), ye shall come back. The first course belongs to"
10756,SECTION LVIII.,"fork-tailed shrikes and others living on grain; the second, to those"
10757,SECTION LVIII.,that live on animals and fruits; the third is ranged by Bhāshas; the
10758,SECTION LVIII.,"fourth by Kraunchas, Kuvaras and hawks; the fifth by vultures; the sixth"
10759,SECTION LVIII.,belongs to swans endowed with youth and beauty; and the next to the
10760,SECTION LVIII.,Vainateyas. We have derived our origin from Vainateya.¹⁸³ (By
10761,SECTION LVIII.,"despatching you thither), I shall avenge the heinous deed perpetrated by"
10762,SECTION LVIII.,"the cannibal, as well as the wrong done by Rāvana unto my brother."
10763,SECTION LVIII.,"Resting here, I see Rāvana and Jānaki. We have excellent _Sauparna_¹⁸⁴"
10764,SECTION LVIII.,"clairvoyance. For this reason, as well as owing to the energy consequent"
10765,SECTION LVIII.,"on our feeding on certain kinds of flesh, we, ye monkeys, can see a"
10766,SECTION LVIII.,little further than an hundred _yojanas_. Therefore (the Deity) hath
10767,SECTION LVIII.,ordained such food for us as are fraught with the power of making one
10768,SECTION LVIII.,see from a great distance. And the abode of cocks and others being
10769,SECTION LVIII.,"underneath trees, their sight is limited to the extent which they"
10770,SECTION LVIII.,require to see. Do ye look about for means to cross over the salt
10771,SECTION LVIII.,"waters. Having met with Vaidehi, do ye, having achieved success, come"
10772,SECTION LVIII.,back. I wish to be taken by you to the ocean—abode of Varuna. I will
10773,SECTION LVIII.,"offer water unto (the manes of) my high-souled brother, who hath gone to"
10774,SECTION LVIII.,"heaven."" Thereat those heroes, the monkeys possessed of exceeding"
10775,SECTION LVIII.,"energy, carried to the destined spot on the shore of the ocean, Sampāti,"
10776,SECTION LVIII.,whose wings had been scathed. Then carrying that lord of vultures back

10811,SECTION LIX.,are exceedingly wrathful; fear is excessive in deer; and we have
10812,SECTION LIX.,"excessive hunger. Once on a time my son, going forth about sunrise to"
10813,SECTION LIX.,procure food for me who was suffering from hunger and (accordingly)
10814,SECTION LIX.,"eager for it, came back in the evening without any flesh. Hurt (by my"

10822,SECTION LIX.,"in splendour. Seeing them, I had made up my mind that they should serve"

10873,SECTION LX.,"came to know Maithili. My body being affected by solar heat, and my"
10874,SECTION LX.,"wings burnt by the rays of the sun, O sinless one, I formerly fell to"
10875,SECTION LX.,"this summit of Vindhya. On regaining my senses after six nights, during"
10876,SECTION LX.,"which I was insensible, I looked around in bewilderment, but could not"
10877,SECTION LX.,"recognise anything whatever. Then closely viewing oceans and mountains,"

10880,SECTION LX.,"crested with summits, I for certain concluded it to be Vindhya on the"

10882,SECTION LX.,"by the celestials, and here dwelt a saint named Niçākara, of fierce"

11140,SECTION LXV.,course thus far. But such a bound shall not bring success on our

11189,SECTION LXVI.,"famous by the cognomen of Garutroin, is the foremost of birds. Many a"

11192,SECTION LXVI.,strength that is in his wings is equal to the might and virtue of thy

11194,SECTION LXVI.,"and thy understanding, thy energy, and thy vigour, O foremost of"

11196,SECTION LXVI.,"thyself furnished with everything that is noble or great, (for this"
11197,SECTION LXVI.,"feat)? That foremost of Apsarās,—the famous Punjikathalā, more famed"
11198,SECTION LXVI.,"under the name of Anjanā, is the spouse of the monkey Kesarin. Famed"
11199,SECTION LXVI.,"over the three worlds, and incomparable on earth by virtue of her"
11200,SECTION LXVI.,"beauty, by an imprecation, my son, she was born in the monkey-race,"

11205,SECTION LXVI.,of clouds in the rainy season. And it came to pass that as that one of
11206,SECTION LXVI.,"expansive eyes was standing on the summit of the mount, the Wind gently"
11207,SECTION LXVI.,stole away her elegant yellow cloth with crimson skirts. And he had a
11208,SECTION LXVI.,"sight of her fair and fine face, together with her well-developed"
11209,SECTION LXVI.,breasts. And soon as the Wind saw that illustrious one of spacious hips
11210,SECTION LXVI.,"and slender waist, and whose every limb was lovely,— he was amain"
11211,SECTION LXVI.,"overcome by desire. And all his frame possessed by _Manmatha_, and"
11212,SECTION LXVI.,"deprived of self, the Wind embraced that blameless one by means of his"
11213,SECTION LXVI.,"long arms. Thereat, influenced by fear, that one of excellent vows"
11214,SECTION LXVI.,"said,— ’Who is it that desireth to lay violent hands upon my chastity?’"
11215,SECTION LXVI.,"Hearing Anjanā’s words, the Wind answered,— ’I do not wrong thee, O thou"
11216,SECTION LXVI.,"of shapely hips. Let not fear enter thy heart. As, O famous damsel, by"
11217,SECTION LXVI.,"embracing thee, I have mentally entered into thy womb, thou shalt bear a"
11218,SECTION LXVI.,"son, intelligent and endeued with prowess. And, gifted with great"
11219,SECTION LXVI.,"strength, and possessing exceeding energy, and having vast vigor, he"
11220,SECTION LXVI.,"shall equal me in bounding and leaping.’ Thus addressed, O mighty"
11221,SECTION LXVI.,"monkey, thy mother, O long-armed one, O foremost of monkeys, gave birth"
11222,SECTION LXVI.,"to thee in a cave. And in that mighty forest, thou, a child, desirous of"
11223,SECTION LXVI.,"eating, seeing the Sun risen, and taking him to be a fruit, sprang up"

11234,SECTION LXVI.,"the Wind being mollified, Brahmā conferred on him a boon, saying,—’O"
11235,SECTION LXVI.,"child, O thou of true prowess, (thy son) shall be incapable of being"

11333,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys, endued with immeasurable might, storming. And, hearing his"
11334,SECTION LXVII.,"speech capable of removing the grief of kindred, that best of monkeys"
11335,SECTION LXVII.,"Jambavān, transported with joy, said,—""O hero! O son of Kesari! O"
11336,SECTION LXVII.,"offspring of the Wind! the huge sorrow of thy kindred hath, my child,"
11337,SECTION LXVII.,"been destroyed by thee. And these foremost of monkeys assembled, who"
11338,SECTION LXVII.,"wish for thy welfare, shall, with intent minds, perform acts tending to"
11339,SECTION LXVII.,"thy weal,—so that thou mayst succeed in thy undertaking. And by the"
11340,SECTION LXVII.,"grace of the saints, and with the permission of the aged monkeys, and by"
11341,SECTION LXVII.,"the blessing of the superiors, do thou bound over the mighty main. Till"
11342,SECTION LXVII.,"thou return, we shall stay on one leg.²⁰⁷ The lives of all these rangers"
11343,SECTION LXVII.,"of the forest shall go along with thee."" Then that tiger-like monkey"
11344,SECTION LXVII.,"said unto those rangers of the woods,—""None in this world would be able"
11345,SECTION LXVII.,"to sustain my impetus in the act of bounding. Here are these summits,"
11346,SECTION LXVII.,"firm and spacious, of this mountain, Mahendra, thronged with crags. I"
11347,SECTION LXVII.,"shall rush forward from these summits of Mahendra, interspersed with"
11348,SECTION LXVII.,trees and adorned with masses of ore. And as I leap over a hundred
11349,SECTION LXVII.,"_yojanas_, these mighty summits shall sustain my impetus."" Then he"
11350,SECTION LXVII.,"equalling the Wind, that monkey, the son of the Wind-god, pounder of"
11351,SECTION LXVII.,"enemies, ascended that best of mountains, Mahendra; covered with various"
11352,SECTION LXVII.,"trees and flowers, furnished with swards; ranged by deer; containing"
11353,SECTION LXVII.,plants and blossoms with trees bearing fruits and flowers daily; having
11354,SECTION LXVII.,tigers and lions and infuriated elephants; swarming with maddened birds;
11355,SECTION LXVII.,"and abounding with fountains. Ascending (Mahendra), that foremost of"
11356,SECTION LXVII.,"monkeys endeued with exceeding strength, and resembling Mahendra himself"
11357,SECTION LXVII.,"in prowess, began to range from one mighty summit to another. Thereat,"
11358,SECTION LXVII.,"hurt by the arms of that high-souled one, that mighty mountain began to"
11359,SECTION LXVII.,"cry,²⁰⁸ like a mighty mad elephant tormented by a lion. And water rushed"
11360,SECTION LXVII.,out of masses of rocks scattered around. And that mighty mountain had
11361,SECTION LXVII.,its deer and elephants afflicted with afright; and its giant trees
11362,SECTION LXVII.,shaken: and its spacious uplands deserted by various Gandharva couples
11363,SECTION LXVII.,"engaged in drinking and dalliance, and by birds flying away, and by"
11364,SECTION LXVII.,"bevies of Vidyādharas; and its huge serpents distressed, and its cliffs"

11366,SECTION LXVII.,"bodies half issuing (from their holes), the mountain seemed as if it"
11367,SECTION LXVII.,shone with pennons displayed. And the heap of crags forsaken by saints
11368,SECTION LXVII.,"exercised with fear and agitation, looked doleful, like a wayfarer left"

11400,SECTION I.,intelligent and staid one began to range at ease in lapis-hued lawns
11401,SECTION I.,"resembling water, like a lion bursting in energy. And on the level of"
11402,SECTION I.,"that foremost of mountains, filled with nonpareil Nāgas, and embellished"

11405,SECTION I.,"Yakshas and Kinnaras and Gandharvas and Pannagas, excellently"

11407,SECTION I.,"joining his hands to the Sun, Mahendra, Wind,²¹¹ the Self-create, and"
11408,SECTION I.,"all Beings, he set his heart upon his journey. Then having,with his face"
11409,SECTION I.,"to the East, joined his palms to his Sire, that blessed one began to"
11410,SECTION I.,attain proportions for journeying towards the South. And sure as the sea
11411,SECTION I.,"increases on the occasion of a _Parva_, (Hanumān) determined on his"
11412,SECTION I.,"leap, experiencing exhilaration, began, in the midst of the foremost"
11413,SECTION I.,"monkeys, to increase for the behoof of Rāma. Attaining measureless"
11414,SECTION I.,"magnitude, he desirous of crossing over the ocean, pressed the mountain"
11415,SECTION I.,"with his arms and legs. And roughly handled by the monkey, the mountain"
11416,SECTION I.,anon shook for a while; and all the blossoms showered down from the tops
11417,SECTION I.,of the trees. And covered all over with heaps of fragrant flowers thrown
11418,SECTION I.,"off from the trees, the entire mountain wore one floral look. And"
11419,SECTION I.,"afflicted by that one of first-rate prowess, that mountain shed water,"
11420,SECTION I.,"like an elephant in rut. And hard beset by that powerful one, the"
11421,SECTION I.,"mountain Mahendra put out the golden, silvern and collyrium sheen (that"
11422,SECTION I.,appertained thereto). And the mountain began to cast forth huge crags
11423,SECTION I.,containing red arsenic; and its middle resembled smoke embosoming a
11424,SECTION I.,sparkling flame. And sore tormented by the monkey engaged in harassing
11425,SECTION I.,"them, all the creatures dwelling in the caverns cried in frightful"
11426,SECTION I.,tones. And that mighty chorus²¹² of the creatures consequent on the
11427,SECTION I.,"mountain’s agony filled the entire earth, all the cardinal points, and"
11428,SECTION I.,the groves. And snakes bringing out their spacious hoods marked with
11429,SECTION I.,"blue streaks, vomitting fierce fire, began to bite at the rocks with"
11430,SECTION I.,"their fangs. And those gigantic crags, bit at by those enraged (snakes)"
11431,SECTION I.,"of virulent venom, flamed up with fire and were shivered unto a thousand"

11433,SECTION I.,"with the virtue of neutralizing poison, could not tame the fierceness of"
11434,SECTION I.,"the venom of those serpents. Then, conceiving that the mountain was"
11435,SECTION I.,"being riven by Brahma Rākshasas, the ascetics, becoming agitated, as"
11436,SECTION I.,"well as the Vidyādharas together with their females, began to flee away."
11437,SECTION I.,"And forsaking their golden seats and cans on the drinking grounds, and"
11438,SECTION I.,"costly vessels, and water-pots plated with gold, and diverse suckable"

11442,SECTION I.,flew into the firmament. And fair ones decked in chains and bangles and
11443,SECTION I.,"Keyuras and bracelets,²¹³ struck with amaze, with a smile rose in the"

11445,SECTION I.,"Vidyadharas and Maharshis, mounted into the sky, gazing at the mountain."
11446,SECTION I.,"And they heard the words of spirit-pervaded ascetics, and Chāranas, and"
11447,SECTION I.,"Siddhas, stationed in the azure sky: ""This mountain-like Hanumān, son of"
11448,SECTION I.,"the Wind, endeued with exceeding vehemence, is anxious to cross over the"
11449,SECTION I.,main—abode of Varuna. And undertaking an arduous task in the interests
11450,SECTION I.,"of Rāma and monkeys, this one wishes to go to the other shore of the sea"
11451,SECTION I.,"hard to reach."" Hearing this speech of the ascetics, the Vidyādharas saw"
11452,SECTION I.,in the mountain that foremost of monkeys of immeasurable might. And that
11453,SECTION I.,one resembling fire shook and bristled his down; and he set up a
11454,SECTION I.,"tremendous roar resembling a mighty (rumbling) cloud. And springing up,"
11455,SECTION I.,"he lashed his tail furnished all over with hair and folds, like the king"
11456,SECTION I.,of birds handling a serpent. And the tail of that one endued with
11457,SECTION I.,"exceeding impetus, bent and brandished, seemed like a gigantic serpent"
11458,SECTION I.,carried off by Garuda. And the monkey planted his arms resembling mighty
11459,SECTION I.,"clubs, fast (on the mountain); and his waist became slender; and his"
11460,SECTION I.,"legs were contracted. And contracting his arms²¹⁴ and neck, that"
11461,SECTION I.,"graceful and powerful one summoned energy, and strength, physical and"
11462,SECTION I.,"mental. And looking at his way from a distance, Hanumān, raising his"
11463,SECTION I.,"eyes up, and fixing his gaze at the sky, suspended his breath in his"
11464,SECTION I.,"breast. And planting his feet firmly, that one endowed with mighty"
11465,SECTION I.,"strength, Hanumān, foremost of monkeys, contracting his ears up, sprang"
11466,SECTION I.,"forward; and that best of monkeys spoke unto the monkeys, saying,— ""As a"
11467,SECTION I.,"shaft shot by Rāghava, courses like the wind, so will I course to Lankā"
11468,SECTION I.,"ruled by Rāvana. And if I fail to find Janaka’s daughter in Lankā, I"
11469,SECTION I.,shall with the self-same speed repair to the regions of the celestials.
11470,SECTION I.,"And if I do not find Sitā in Lankā, after taking so much trouble, I"
11471,SECTION I.,"shall bring the Rākshasa king bound. Either attaining complete success,"
11472,SECTION I.,"I shall come hither (back); or uprooting Lankā, with Rāvana in it, I"
11473,SECTION I.,"shall carry it hither."" Having observed this, the monkey Hanumān,"
11474,SECTION I.,"foremost of monkeys, endowed with speed, without pausing for thought,"
11475,SECTION I.,suddenly sprang up. And that powerful monkey deemed himself like unto
11476,SECTION I.,"Suparna. And as he flew up, the trees situated in that mountain, in"
11477,SECTION I.,"consequence of his violent rush, shrinking their boughs, rolled over on"
11478,SECTION I.,all sides. And drawing up blossoming trees filled with maddened
11479,SECTION I.,"lapwings, by the vehemence of his flight, he coursed on in the clear"
11480,SECTION I.,"sky. And those trees borne up by the vehemence of his flight, followed"
11481,SECTION I.,"the monkey for a while, like friends following a friend that hath set"
11482,SECTION I.,out for a far country. And pulled up by the impetus of his (rushing)
11483,SECTION I.,"thighs, _Sālas_ and other mighty trees followed Hanumān, as an army"
11484,SECTION I.,follows its monarch. And surrounded by innumerable trees having their
11485,SECTION I.,"tops crested with flowers, Hanumān wearing a mountain-like appearance,"
11486,SECTION I.,"was wonderful to behold. And those trees that were more ponderous,"
11487,SECTION I.,"plunged into the salt sea, as plunged the mountains into Varuna’s abode,"
11488,SECTION I.,afflicted with the fear of Mahendra.²¹⁵ And strewn with various sprouts
11489,SECTION I.,"and buds and blossoms, the monkey resembling a mass of clouds, looked"
11490,SECTION I.,lovely like a hill filled with glow-worms. And uprooted by the force of
11491,SECTION I.,"his rush, those trees, their flowers fallen off, plunged into the sea,"
11492,SECTION I.,like friends returning to their homes (after having accompanied their
11493,SECTION I.,"friend some way). And blown by the wind caused by the monkey, the"
11494,SECTION I.,various variegated flowers of the trees in consequence of their
11495,SECTION I.,"lightness, showered down on the sea. And covered with heaps of fragrant"
11496,SECTION I.,"flowers of diverse hues, the monkey resembled a mass of clouds"
11497,SECTION I.,embellished by lines of lightning. And the waters (of the ocean) strewn
11498,SECTION I.,"with blossoms carried off by his motion, appeared like the sky garnished"
11499,SECTION I.,with charming stars (cresting the same). And his arms stretched in the
11500,SECTION I.,"sky, seemed like five-hooded snakes issuing from a mountain. And he"
11501,SECTION I.,appeared as if he was drinking up the mighty deep with its multitudes of
11502,SECTION I.,"waves, or as if that redoubtable monkey was desirous of sucking up the"
11503,SECTION I.,"sky itself. And as he coursed the orbit of air, his eyes flashing like"
11504,SECTION I.,"lightning, resembled two craters²¹⁶ aglow on a mountain. And the eyes of"
11505,SECTION I.,that foremost of tawny-hued ones resembled the sun and the moon
11506,SECTION I.,"stationed in a vast yellow aureola. And beside his coppery nose, his"
11507,SECTION I.,"face looked coppery, as looks the solar disc on the approach of eve. And"
11508,SECTION I.,"the uplifted tail of the Wind-god’s offspring engaged in bounding,"
11509,SECTION I.,appeared beautiful in the sky like the raised standard of Sakra. And the
11510,SECTION I.,"exceedingly wise son of the Wind, Hanumān, having white teeth, with his"
11511,SECTION I.,"tail coiled up, looked handsome like the sun with his disc. And on"
11512,SECTION I.,"account of his waist being deeply coppery, that mighty monkey appeared"
11513,SECTION I.,like a mountain running a mighty torrent mixed with minerals and red
11514,SECTION I.,chalk. And the wind that had got into the armpits of that leonine monkey
11515,SECTION I.,"who was crossing over the main, roareth like clouds. And as a meteor"
11516,SECTION I.,"consisting of many smaller ones, darting from above falleth down (to the"
11517,SECTION I.,"earth), rushed on that foremost of monkeys. And then that stalwart"
11518,SECTION I.,"monkey resembling the careering sun, resembled a mad elephant fettered"
11519,SECTION I.,"by the middle, whose bulk has increased immensely. And as he coursed"
11520,SECTION I.,"above, on account of the reflection cast by his body (on the bosom of"
11521,SECTION I.,"the deep), the monkey²¹⁷ looked like a bark swayed by the breeze. And"
11522,SECTION I.,"wherever that mighty monkey went about the sea, the state of things"
11523,SECTION I.,appeared to undergo a violent convulsion owing to impetus imparted by
11524,SECTION I.,"his body. And that mighty monkey possessed of exceeding speed, rushed"
11525,SECTION I.,"on, raising multitudes of surges on the sea by his breast resembling"
11526,SECTION I.,"rock. And the wind begot of the monkey as well as that of the clouds,"
11527,SECTION I.,"issuing out, made the dread-sounding ocean roll violently. And pushing"
11528,SECTION I.,"up multitudes of high-heaving billows from the salt waters, that"
11529,SECTION I.,"tiger-like monkey rushed on, separating earth and heaven. And that one"
11530,SECTION I.,endeued with vehement speed passed over surges in the mighty main
11531,SECTION I.,resembling Mandara or Meru; as if counting them²¹⁸. And the waters
11532,SECTION I.,"lashed up to the clouds by the force (of his speed), looked like"
11533,SECTION I.,autumnal clouds overspreading the sky. And then whales and alligators
11534,SECTION I.,"and fishes and tortoises appeared plainly visible, like the persons of"
11535,SECTION I.,"individuals, when the cloth hath been taken off them. And sea-serpents,"
11536,SECTION I.,"seeing that tiger-like monkey proceeding in the sky, took him for"
11537,SECTION I.,"Suparna himself. And the shadow of the leonine monkey, measuring ten"
11538,SECTION I.,"_yojanas_ in width and thirty length, seemed the more handsome in"
11539,SECTION I.,consequence of his deed. And that shadow resembling masses of white
11540,SECTION I.,"clouds, falling on the salt waters and following the wind-god’s son,"
11541,SECTION I.,seemed exceedingly beautiful. And that exceedingly energetic mighty
11542,SECTION I.,"monkey possessed of a gigantic body, appeared splendid in the"
11543,SECTION I.,"unsupported aerial way, like a winged mountain. And the deep beside the"
11544,SECTION I.,"course that was being vehemently pursued by that elephantine monkey, was"
11545,SECTION I.,suddenly turned into a water-course.²¹⁹ And coursing through the regions
11546,SECTION I.,"of fowls like the monarch of the feathered race, Hanumān, pushing away"
11547,SECTION I.,"masses of clouds, resembled the wind himself, And collossal clouds"
11548,SECTION I.,"scattered by the monkey, pale and crimson and blue and _mangistha_-hued,"
11549,SECTION I.,"looked exceedingly lovely, And now entering into the clouds, and now"
11550,SECTION I.,"emerging from them, he looked like the moon, sometimes hid and sometimes"
11551,SECTION I.,"visible. And beholding that monkey engaged in bounding with celerity,"
11552,SECTION I.,"gods, Gandharbas and Dānavas began to strew blossoms (on him). And as he"
11553,SECTION I.,"was leaping,the Sun did not burn him; and the Wind ministered unto him,"
11554,SECTION I.,"for the success of Rāma’s work. And the saints hymned his praises, as he"
11555,SECTION I.,"was leaping on in the sky. And applauding the ranger of forests, they"
11556,SECTION I.,"raised the voice of song. And _nagas_ and Yakshas, and various (races"
11557,SECTION I.,"of) Rākshasas, eulogized (him), on beholding that tiger-like monkey,"
11558,SECTION I.,"Hanumān, in the act of bounding. And Hanumān, that lord of monkeys,"
11559,SECTION I.,"being engaged in the act of bounding, the Ocean, wishing glory unto the"
11560,SECTION I.,"race of the Ikshwākus, thought within himself, ""Truly shall I be blamed"
11561,SECTION I.,of all persons if I do not assist this lord of monkeys— Hānuman. Reared
11562,SECTION I.,"I have been by Sagara, the foremost of the race of the Ikshwākus—and"
11563,SECTION I.,this monkey is their counsellor. It therefore doth not behove me to tire
11564,SECTION I.,him out. It becometh me to do that by which the monkey may take rest in
11565,SECTION I.,"me and, relieved, may happily traverse the remaining way."" Having"
11566,SECTION I.,"arrived at this wholesome resolution, the Ocean spake unto that best of"
11567,SECTION I.,"mountains, Maināka, hued in gold and situate in the waters, saying, ""O"
11568,SECTION I.,"lord, thou hast been placed here by the king of celestials as an outer"
11569,SECTION I.,"gate against the Asuras inhabiting the region under the earth. Thou too,"
11570,SECTION I.,"from then, hast been waiting at this gate, unapproachable by the Asuras,"
11571,SECTION I.,rising up again and again and whose prowess is well-known (unto the Lord
11572,SECTION I.,"of celestials). O mountain, thou art capable of expanding thyself"
11573,SECTION I.,"upwards, downwards and on thy sides. I do command thee therefore, O best"
11574,SECTION I.,"of mountains, to rise up. That best of monkeys, the energetic Hanumān,"
11575,SECTION I.,"the performer of mighty deeds, engaged in Rāma’s service, worn out with"
11576,SECTION I.,"fatigue, waiteth above thee. Beholding the exhaustion of that leader of"
11577,SECTION I.,"monkeys, it behoveth thee to rise up."" Hearing the speech of the Ocean,"
11578,SECTION I.,"the golden mountain Maināka, covered with tall trees and creepers, rose"
11579,SECTION I.,up instantly from his watery bed. Like unto the Sun of bright rays
11580,SECTION I.,"rising out of the watery expanse, he uplifted himself from the Ocean."
11581,SECTION I.,"Being thus commanded by the Ocean, the great mountain, covered on all"
11582,SECTION I.,"sides with water, immediately brought forth his peaks. The sky was as if"
11583,SECTION I.,"cleft by these golden summits like unto the rising of the Sun, inhabited"
11584,SECTION I.,by _Kinnaras_ and large Serpents. The golden summits of that mountain
11585,SECTION I.,"being thus lifted up, the dark-blue sky assumed the golden hue. And by"
11586,SECTION I.,those highly resplendent golden peaks that best of mountains assumed the
11587,SECTION I.,brilliance of a thousand suns. Beholding before him that up-heaved
11588,SECTION I.,"mountain in the midst of the salt Ocean, Hanumān regarded it, as a"
11589,SECTION I.,"barrier for aye. Like unto Wind dispersing clouds, that mighty monkey"
11590,SECTION I.,with great velocity crushed down those up-lifted peaks with his breast.
11591,SECTION I.,"Being thus crushed down by that monkey, the best of mountains, being"
11592,SECTION I.,"apprized of his prowess, began to shout with joy. Thereupon, with a glad"
11593,SECTION I.,heart assuming the semblance of a man and stationing himself upon his
11594,SECTION I.,"own summit, that mountain-chief addressed Hanumān, saying, ""O best of"
11595,SECTION I.,"monkeys, forsooth hast thou been engaged in this arduous task. Coming"
11596,SECTION I.,down on my peak do thou take rest. This ocean was reared by one born in
11597,SECTION I.,the family of Raghus. And beholding thee engaged on Rāma’s behoof he is
11598,SECTION I.,worshipping thee. The best and everlasting virtue consists in returning
11599,SECTION I.,benefits unto one who hath benefitted us. Bent on returning benefits
11600,SECTION I.,"unto Raghu’s race, he deserveth respect from thee. And to welcome thee"
11601,SECTION I.,properly I have been despatched by him with the message—’Traversing over
11602,SECTION I.,a hundred _yojanas_ this monkey hath been worn out with fatigue; let him
11603,SECTION I.,voyage to the remaining way after resting for a while on thy summit. Do
11604,SECTION I.,"thou therefore, O best of monkeys, remain here and take rest. And"
11605,SECTION I.,"feasting on these many fragrant and sweet fruits and roots, O foremost"
11606,SECTION I.,"of monkeys, do thou relieve thyself of the toil and proceed. O leader of"
11607,SECTION I.,"monkeys, my relation with thee is replete with many virtues and known"
11608,SECTION I.,"all over the three worlds. O Son of Maruta, O best of monkeys, I know"
11609,SECTION I.,thee to be the foremost of all monkeys. Even an ordinary guest should be
11610,SECTION I.,"adored by him who abideth by virtue, what of thee great as thou art? O"
11611,SECTION I.,"thou lion among monkeys, thou art the son of Maruta, the foremost of"
11612,SECTION I.,celestials and art his equal in speed. Thou that art conversant with
11613,SECTION I.,"virtue, being worshipped, Maruta himself receiveth offerings. Thou art"
11614,SECTION I.,"therefore worthy of my adoration. Hearken, there is another reason for"
11615,SECTION I.,"it. O worshipful one, in olden times, the mountains, gifted with wings,"
11616,SECTION I.,began to range all quarters with velocity like unto Garuda. They moving
11617,SECTION I.,"thus, the celestials, the asceties, and all creatures became almost"
11618,SECTION I.,"faint with fear of their falling down. Highly enraged therefore, the"
11619,SECTION I.,"thousand-eyed Deity, the performer of hundred sacrifices, sundered with"
11620,SECTION I.,"his thunderbolt, the wings of hundreds and thousands of them. When with"
11621,SECTION I.,"his thunderbolt, the Lord of celestials, wroth, approached me, I was all"
11622,SECTION I.,on a sudden thrown down by the high-souled Wind. O best of monkeys I was

11626,SECTION I.,"monkeys, is pregnant with many virtues. The time for returning benefits"
11627,SECTION I.,"having arrived, O high-souled one, it behoveth thee to afford me and the"
11628,SECTION I.,"ocean, satisfaction with a blessed heart. O best of monkeys, relieve"
11629,SECTION I.,"thyself of the fatigue and accept my affectionate offerings, who am"
11630,SECTION I.,"worthy of thy respect.²²⁰ Happy am I to see thee."" Being thus accosted"
11631,SECTION I.,"by Maināka, the best of mountains, Hanumān, the foremost of monkeys"
11632,SECTION I.,"said, saying:—""Pleased am I and thou hast shown me enough of"
11633,SECTION I.,hospitality. Do thou give up thy wrath.²²¹ Business wants me to go soon
11634,SECTION I.,and the time is well-nigh spent. Besides I have promised that I shall
11635,SECTION I.,"not halt at any intermediate place."" Thereupon touching the hill with"
11636,SECTION I.,"his hand that highly energetic monkey wended, smiling, his aerial way."
11637,SECTION I.,Thereat the ocean and the mountain respectfully looked towards him and
11638,SECTION I.,adored and welcomed him with blessings worthy of the occasion. Leaving
11639,SECTION I.,"the mountain and the ocean and rising high up, he proceeded in the clear"
11640,SECTION I.,welkin traversing the aerial way.²²² Rising high up and casting his look
11641,SECTION I.,"down on the hill, that foremost of monkeys proceeded by the unsupported"
11642,SECTION I.,"aerial track. Beholding this singularly arduous work of Hanumān, the"
11643,SECTION I.,"celestials, the _Siddhas_ and the ascetics all praised him. All the"
11644,SECTION I.,"celestials and others living on its summit, were highly pleased with the"
11645,SECTION I.,mountain arrayed in gold and having beautiful sides. And the
11646,SECTION I.,thousand-eyed Vasava was also pleased. And greatly pleased that highly
11647,SECTION I.,"intelligent Sachi’s lord, himself, addressed that best of mountains"
11648,SECTION I.,"having picturesque sides, saying:—""Greatly delighted am I, O lord of"
11649,SECTION I.,"mountains, O thou having golden peaks. ’No fear’ I do declare unto thee."
11650,SECTION I.,"Proceedest thou therefore, at thy ease, O gentle one! Greatly hast thou"
11651,SECTION I.,"helped Hanumān, crossing fearlessly and unceasingly, over hundred"
11652,SECTION I.,"_yojanas_ to that he might not fall in danger. This monkey, is goiug in"
11653,SECTION I.,"the interests of Rāma, Daçaratha’s son—and thou hast welcomed bin to the"
11654,SECTION I.,"best of thy might. Therefore I am greatly pleased with thee."" Beholding"
11655,SECTION I.,"that lord of celestials the performer or an hundred sacrifices, highly"
11656,SECTION I.,"gratified, that best of mountains attained to an excess of joy. And"
11657,SECTION I.,having received boons (from Indra) the Mountain occupied again its
11658,SECTION I.,pristine place. And Hanumān in a short time crossed over the main.
11659,SECTION I.,"Thereupon the celestials along with Gandharvas, Siddhas and the"
11660,SECTION I.,"ascetics, spake unto Surasā the mother of serpents, resembling the Sun,"
11661,SECTION I.,"saying:—""The highly effulgent son of Wind named Hanumān is crossing over"
11662,SECTION I.,the main. Thou art required to throw obstacles in his way for a while.
11663,SECTION I.,"Assuming therefore the semblance of a terrible, grim-visaged Rākshasa,"
11664,SECTION I.,resembling a huge mountain and having terrible teeth and a face with
11665,SECTION I.,"coppery eyes, do thou touch the welkin. We are anxious to learn if he"
11666,SECTION I.,"defeateth thee by some means or cometh by grief."" Thus addressed the"
11667,SECTION I.,"Worshipful Surasā, having been honored by the celestials, deformed and"
11668,SECTION I.,"horrible and capable of exciting the fear of all beings, and obstructing"
11669,SECTION I.,"Hanumān as he was coursing on, said,—""O foremost of monkeys, thou hast"
11670,SECTION I.,"been ordained as my fare by the gods themselves. I will eat thee up,—do"
11671,SECTION I.,thou enter my mouth. Even this is the boon that was conferred on me by
11672,SECTION I.,"the Deity."" Having delivered herself thus speedily, the opening her"
11673,SECTION I.,"mouth wide, stood before the son of the wind-god."" Thus accosted by"
11674,SECTION I.,"Surasā, (Hanumān) with a glad countenance, said,—""Rāma, son unto"
11675,SECTION I.,"Daçaratha, had entered the Dandaka forest in company with his brother,"
11676,SECTION I.,"Lakshmana, and his wife, Vaidehi. He having created hostility with the"
11677,SECTION I.,"Rākshasas, his illustrious wife, Sitā, while he was engrossed in some"
11678,SECTION I.,"work, was carried away by Rāvana. At Rāma’s command, I go to her as his"
11679,SECTION I.,"envoy. It behoveth thee, living in (Rāma’s) dominions, to lend him thy"
11680,SECTION I.,"help. Or having seen Mithilā’s daughter, as well as Rāma of untiring"
11681,SECTION I.,"deeds, I will enter thy mouth. This I promise thee truly."" Thus"
11682,SECTION I.,"addressed by Hanumān, Surasā, capable of wearing forms at will,"
11683,SECTION I.,"said,—""None shall pass me without being devoured by me,—even this is the"
11684,SECTION I.,"boon that I have received."" Then seeing him go away, the mother of the"
11685,SECTION I.,"Nāgas, Surasā, derious of essaying the strength of Hanumān, spoke. ""O"
11686,SECTION I.,"best of monkeys, thou shalt have to go, to-day, after entering my mouth."
11687,SECTION I.,"Even this is the boon that was conferred on me by the Deity."" Having"
11688,SECTION I.,"said this swiftly, she extending her capacious mouth wide, stood in"
11689,SECTION I.,"front of the wind-god’s son. Thus addressed by Surasā, that foremost of"
11690,SECTION I.,"monkeys, waxing wroth, said,—""Extend thy mouth so, that thou mayst"
11691,SECTION I.,"contain me."" Having said this unto Surasā, having her mouth measuring"
11692,SECTION I.,"ten _yojanas_, Hanumān enlarged himself as many _yojanas_. Thereat"
11693,SECTION I.,Surasā enlarged her month twenty _yojanas_. And beholding her²²³
11694,SECTION I.,"extended mouth with a long tongue, wondrous dreadful, like unto hill"
11695,SECTION I.,"itself, and resembling clouds, measuring twenty _yojanas_, the"
11696,SECTION I.,"intelligent son of the wind-god, Hanumān, enlarged, made himself measure"
11697,SECTION I.,"thirty _yojanas_. Threat, Surasā, extended her mouth forty _yojanas_,"
11698,SECTION I.,and thereupon the heroic Hanumān attained the altitude of fifty
11699,SECTION I.,_yojanas_. And Surasā enlarged her mouth sixty _yojanas_; and the heroic
11700,SECTION I.,Hanumān anon heightened himself seventy _yojanas_. And Surasā widened
11701,SECTION I.,her mouth eighty _yojanas_; and Hanumān like unto Fire raised himself
11702,SECTION I.,ninety _yojanas_. And Surasā enlarged her mouth an hundred _yojanas_.
11703,SECTION I.,"Thereat diminishing his person like unto a cloud, the wind-god’s son at"
11704,SECTION I.,that moment measured one thumb only. Then entering her month and coming
11705,SECTION I.,"out of it, that exceedingly powerful and graceful one, stationing"
11706,SECTION I.,"himself in the sky spoke thus. ""0 descendant of Daksha, I have entered"
11707,SECTION I.,into thy mouth. I bow down unto thee. I will repair to where Vaidehi is.
11708,SECTION I.,Thy boon hath proved true. Seeing him out of her mouth like the Moon out
11709,SECTION I.,"of the mouth of Rāhu, the venerable Surasā spoke unto the monkey in her"
11710,SECTION I.,"native form, saying,—""For compassing thy end, go, O foremost of monkeys,"
11711,SECTION I.,"O mild one, at thine ease. And bringing unto Vaidehi tidings touching"
11712,SECTION I.,"the high-souled Rāghava do thou meet her."" Witnessing that third act²²⁴"
11713,SECTION I.,"of Hanumān’s hard to perform, all beings extolled the monkey exclaming,"
11714,SECTION I.,"""Excellent! Excellent!"" Then he, resembling the wind in rush, arrived at"
11715,SECTION I.,"the irrepressible ocean—abode of Varuna—went on, enveloping the welkin,"
11716,SECTION I.,"on the aerial way, visited by showers, ranged by fowls and Gandharbas,"
11717,SECTION I.,"graced by the iris; embellished by shining vehicles rolling on, drawn by"
11718,SECTION I.,"lions, or elephants, or tigers, or bird-serpents; presided over by"
11719,SECTION I.,eminently pious and righteous persons who have won the regions of
11720,SECTION I.,heaven; and therefore appearing as if adorned by the (five) Fires; of
11721,SECTION I.,the touch of _Açani_ or _Vayra_; (ever) served by Fire bearing
11722,SECTION I.,sacrificial oblations; garnished by planets and stars and astral
11723,SECTION I.,"luminaries, and the Sun and the Moon; thronged with Maharshis, and"
11724,SECTION I.,"Gandharbas and Nāgas, and Yakhas; and pure, and speckless;—the support"
11725,SECTION I.,of the universe—inhabited by Viçwāvasu; lorded over by the elephants of
11726,SECTION I.,"the king of the celestials; the orbit of the Sun and Moon, endowed with"
11727,SECTION I.,auspiciousness constituting the canopy of this live world; blameless;
11728,SECTION I.,"and made by Brahmā; crowded with countless heroes, and Vidyādharas. And"
11729,SECTION I.,"the wind-god’s son Hanumān, scattering clouds like the very Wind"
11730,SECTION I.,"himself, coursed on in the aerial way like Garuda. And mighty clouds,"
11731,SECTION I.,"hued like _Kālāguru_²²⁵ red, and yellow and sable, on being dispersed by"
11732,SECTION I.,"the monkey, burst into brilliance. And again and again entering into the"
11733,SECTION I.,"clouds and emerging out of them, he resembled the Moon during the rains"
11734,SECTION I.,now entering (into clouds) and now issuing out of them. And everywhere
11735,SECTION I.,"Hanumān, son unto the wind-god coursing through the unsupported sky,"
11736,SECTION I.,looked like the monarch of mountains furnished with wings. And it came
11737,SECTION I.,"to pass that beholding him in the act of bounding, a Rākshasi named"
11738,SECTION I.,"Sinhikā, of great age, and capable of wearing forms at will, thought"
11739,SECTION I.,"within herself,—""Today after a long lapse of time I shall have my fare."
11740,SECTION I.,"This mighty creature hath after a long time come within my power."""
11741,SECTION I.,"Having thought thus in her mind, she seized (Hanumān’s) shadow.²²⁶ On"
11742,SECTION I.,"his shadow being secured, the monkey reflected,—""As a mighty bark is"
11743,SECTION I.,"retarded in its course in the sea by adverse wind, have I, my prowess"
11744,SECTION I.,"paralysed, been suddenly obstructed in my career."" Then looking above"
11745,SECTION I.,"and below and sideways, the monkey saw a mighty creature arisen from the"
11746,SECTION I.,"salt waters. And seeing that one of a distorted countenace, the"
11747,SECTION I.,"wind-god’s son thought,—""This one is, without doubt, the creature of"
11748,SECTION I.,"wonderful form, possessed of exceeding prowess,—given to securing its"
11749,SECTION I.,"prey by means of its shadow,—which had been described by the"
11750,SECTION I.,"monkey-king. And concluding her to be Sinhikā, from her act,²²⁷ the"
11751,SECTION I.,"intelligent monkey attaining a gigantic body, increased himself, like a"
11752,SECTION I.,mass of clouds during the rains. And seeing the enlarged body of the
11753,SECTION I.,"mighty monkey, she extended her mouth measuring the sky and the nether"
11754,SECTION I.,"regions. And roaring like unto a mass of clouds, she rushed against the"
11755,SECTION I.,"monkey. Thereat, that intelligent and mighty monkey marked her deformed"
11756,SECTION I.,"and huge mouth, her body and its asticulated members. And the"
11757,SECTION I.,"redoubtable monkey hard as the thunderbolt, contracting himself in a"
11758,SECTION I.,"moment, threw himself into her mouth. And the Siddhas and Charanas saw"
11759,SECTION I.,"him sink in her mouth, as the full Moon is taken by Rāhu during a"
11760,SECTION I.,"Parva.— Then tearing her limits by means of his sharp claws, the monkey,"
11761,SECTION I.,"endowed with the celerity of thought, vehemently sprang forward. Then"
11762,SECTION I.,"slaying her by his acuteness of sight, endurance and skill, that heroic,"
11763,SECTION I.,self-controlled monkey again began to swell himself amain. Her heart
11764,SECTION I.,"having been crushed out by Hanumān, she, rendered lifeless, fell into"
11765,SECTION I.,the water. The self-create had created him for compassing her
11766,SECTION I.,"destruction. And seeing Sinhikā speedily slain by the monkey, and"
11767,SECTION I.,"fallen, creatures ranging the sky addressed that foremost of monkeys,"
11768,SECTION I.,"saying,—""Terrible is the deed that thou hast performed to day. Mighty"
11769,SECTION I.,was the creature that hath been slaughtered by thee. Compass thou thine
11770,SECTION I.,"wished-for end without let, O foremost of monkeys. He, O chief of"
11771,SECTION I.,"monkeys, that, like thee, is endowed with endurance, sharp sightedness,"
11772,SECTION I.,"sense, and ability, doth not feel depressed in action."" Honored by these"
11773,SECTION I.,"and wished well as to his purpose, that monkey, worthy of being honored,"
11774,SECTION I.,"set out, enveloping the sky, like him that subsisteth on serpents.²²⁸"
11775,SECTION I.,And it came to pass that as he had almost arrived at the other shore (of
11776,SECTION I.,"the ocean), he looking about on all sides at the end of an hundred"
11777,SECTION I.,_yojanas_ saw a range of woods. And as he went on. that best of monkeys
11778,SECTION I.,"saw an island decked with diverse trees, and groves pertaining Malaya."
11779,SECTION I.,"And he surveyed the sea, and lands bordering thereon, and trees growing"
11780,SECTION I.,"on the sea shore, and the countenances of the spouses of the Sea, And"
11781,SECTION I.,"surveying his own person resembling a mighty mass of clouds, and as if"
11782,SECTION I.,"closing up the sky, that self-possessed one ascertained his course of"
11783,SECTION I.,"action. ""Soon as the Rākshasas shall behold my enlarged body and the"
11784,SECTION I.,"vehemence of my motion, they shall be seized with curiosity concerning"
11785,SECTION I.,"me."" Thus thought that magnanimous one. Thereat diminishing that person"
11786,SECTION I.,"of his resembling a mountain, that self-possessed one, purged of"
11787,SECTION I.,"ignorance, resumed his natural shape. And diminishing that form into the"
11788,SECTION I.,"smallest compass, Hanumān remained in his native form, like that"
11789,SECTION I.,"depriver of Vāli’s prowess, Hari, after he had placed his three steps."
11790,SECTION I.,"And thus wearing various graceful forms, that one, acting after"
11791,SECTION I.,"reflection, having come to the other shore of the ocean incapable of"
11792,SECTION I.,"being reached by others,— on looking over his (immensely magnified"
11793,SECTION I.,"person), reduced his body (to its former size). And that high-souled one"
11794,SECTION I.,"resembling a cloudy pavilion, alighted on the (foremost) summit of the"
11795,SECTION I.,"splendid mountain, Samva; crested with picturesque peaks; and abounding"
11796,SECTION I.,"in _ketakas_, _uddālakas_ and cocoanuts. And reaching the shore of the"
11797,SECTION I.,"sea, and beholding Lankā on the top of that foremost of mountains, the"
11798,SECTION I.,"monkey, renouncing his native form, fell on that mountain, agitating"
11799,SECTION I.,birds and beasts. And having by main force bounded over the ocean
11800,SECTION I.,"heaving with surges, and rife with Dānavas and Panagas, he alighting on"
11801,SECTION I.,"the shore of the mighty main, beheld Lankā like unto Amarāvati."

11924,SECTION II.,"mountain, for a while bethought himself as to the success of Rāma.²³² ""I"
11925,SECTION II.,"cannot in this form succeed in entering the city of the Rākshasas,"
11926,SECTION II.,"guarded by wily and powerful Rākshasas. I should, while engaged in"
11927,SECTION II.,"searching for Jānaki, deceive all the strong and highly energetic"
11928,SECTION II.,"Rākshasas gifted with prowess. For attaining this mighty object, it"
11929,SECTION II.,"behoveth me to enter Lankā, at night in a shape invisible yet well"
11930,SECTION II.,"suited to the end in view."" And beholding the city in that state,"
11931,SECTION II.,"difficult of being subdued by the celestials and Asuras (combined),"
11932,SECTION II.,"Hanumān, sighing momentarily, thought within himself,—""How can I,"
11933,SECTION II.,"without being discovered by the impious lord of Rākshasas, Rāvana,"
11934,SECTION II.,"succeed in seeing Janaka’s daughter, Maithili? How can the work of Rāma"
11935,SECTION II.,cognizant of self (be so managed that it) may not be brought to naught?
11936,SECTION II.,How can I see Janaka’s daughter singly in secret? Actions on the very
11937,SECTION II.,"eve of success, on being obstructed by adverse season and place, and"
11938,SECTION II.,"through the agency of unreflecting envoys, come to nought, even as"
11939,SECTION II.,darkness is dispelled on sunrise. And in respect of what should be
11940,SECTION II.,"undertaken and what not, even the certain decision (of a master assisted"
11941,SECTION II.,"by his counsellors), because of a heedless messenger, doth not appear in"
11942,SECTION II.,"all its beauty: messengers (foolish) yet proud of their knowledge, bring"
11943,SECTION II.,every business to nought. How can I so manage that my business may not
11944,SECTION II.,suffer? How can I avoid recklessness? How can my bounding over the deep
11945,SECTION II.,"bear fruit? On my being seen by the Rākshasas, the work of Rāma"
11946,SECTION II.,"cognizant of self, desirous of the destruction of Rāvana, shall be"
11947,SECTION II.,"marred. Even if I wear a Rākshasa form, I cannot anywhere remain"
11948,SECTION II.,undiscovered by the Rākshasas. What shall I say of any other form? Even
11949,SECTION II.,"the wind, I conceive, doth not stray here, unperceived. Nothing whatever"
11950,SECTION II.,is here that is unknown to the Rākshasas of redoubtable deeds. Should I
11951,SECTION II.,"stay here embodied in my native form, I shall come by destruction; and"
11952,SECTION II.,"the interest also of my master shall suffer. Therefore, diminishing"
11953,SECTION II.,"myself, I shall at night, for compassing the welfare of Rāghava, enter"
11954,SECTION II.,Lankā in my own form. Entering at night Rāvana’s capital difficult of
11955,SECTION II.,"access, I shall, obtaining entry into every dwelling seek Janaka’s"
11956,SECTION II.,"daughter."" Having made up his mind thus, the heroic Hanumān, extremely"
11957,SECTION II.,"eager to see Vaidehi, wished for the setting of the sun. On the sun"
11958,SECTION II.,"having set, at night the Wind-god’s son, contracting his person,"
11959,SECTION II.,"reducing himself to the dimensions of a cat, became wonderful to behold."
11960,SECTION II.,"And at dusk, the powerful Hanumān, springing up, entered the charming"
11961,SECTION II.,city of Lankā with its well divided highways; furnished with rows of
11962,SECTION II.,"edifices having golden pillars, and net-works,—resembling the metropolis"
11963,SECTION II.,of the Gandharbas. And he saw that splendid city containing
11964,SECTION II.,"seven-storied and eight*storied edifices, studded with crystal and"
11965,SECTION II.,adorned with gold. And the dwellings of the Rākshasas were embellished
11966,SECTION II.,with these (ornaments). And graceful golden gateways belonging to the
11967,SECTION II.,Rākshasas everywhere lent splendour unto Lankā adorned all over.
11968,SECTION II.,"Beholding Lankā, wonderful and of inconceivable loveliness, the mighty"

11974,SECTION II.,"And as if ministering unto him,²³³ the Moon furnished with many"

12023,SECTION III.,"endowed with prowess thought within himself,—""This city protected by the"

12025,SECTION III.,being forcibly subdued by any other. This place can be easily entered by
12026,SECTION III.,"Kumuda, and Angada, as well as by that mighty monkey, Sushena; and also"

12028,SECTION III.,"Sun, and that monkey, Kuçaparva, as well as of that foremost of monkeys,"
12029,SECTION III.,"Rikshya, and myself."" And having witnessed the prowess of Rāghava, as"
12030,SECTION III.,"well as the vigor of Lakshmana, the monkey was filled with joy. And that"
12031,SECTION III.,redoubtable monkey beheld the metropolis of the monarch of the
12032,SECTION III.,"Rākshasas; having for her cloth the sea; for her pendants, cow-stalls"
12033,SECTION III.,"and stables; for her breasts, turrets mounted on the walls for"
12034,SECTION III.,"discharging missils,—decked out like a damsel; with her darkness"
12035,SECTION III.,dispelled by bright lights and the mighty planets. And as he was
12036,SECTION III.,"entering, that tiger-like mighty monkey son unto the Wind-god was met by"
12037,SECTION III.,"the city in her native shape. And seeing that best of monkeys, Lankā,"
12038,SECTION III.,"ruled by Rāvana, arising of herself with her countenance rendered"
12039,SECTION III.,"deformed, stood before the heroic son of the Wind; and, emitting a"

12047,SECTION III.,Who art thou that having deformed eyes stayest at the gate of this city?

12049,SECTION III.,"Hanumān’s speech, Lankā, capable of wearing forms at will, waxing wroth"
12050,SECTION III.,"addressed the Wind-god’s offspring, saying,—""I, who am incapable of"

12056,SECTION III.,"the Wind-god,—foremost of monkeys—exerting himself (to secure victory),"
12057,SECTION III.,stood like another hill. And seeing her appear in the form of a deformed
12058,SECTION III.,"female, that foremost and best of monkeys endeued with intelligence,"
12059,SECTION III.,"possessed of prowess, said,—""I will behold the city of Lankā, crowned"

12063,SECTION III.,"Hearing these words of his, Lankā capable of wearing forms at will,"
12064,SECTION III.,"again addressed him in a speech fraught with disonant letters: ""O thou"

12066,SECTION III.,"instance) vanquishing me, thou canst not to-day behold this city ruled"
12067,SECTION III.,"by the monarch of the Rākshasas."" Thereat that tiger of a monkey said"
12068,SECTION III.,"unto that female ranger of the night,—""After seeing this city, O gentle"
12069,SECTION III.,"one, I shall go away even as I have come."" Thereupon, setting up a"
12070,SECTION III.,"mighty and terrible roar, Lankā filled with vehemence, struck at Hanumān"
12071,SECTION III.,"with her palm. And that tiger-like monkey, the energetic offspring of"
12072,SECTION III.,"the wind-god, on being lustily struck by Lankā, emitted a tremendous"
12073,SECTION III.,"roar. And (Hanumān) fastened the fingers of his left hand into a box,"
12074,SECTION III.,"and transported with rage, dealt it unto her. And considering that she"
12075,SECTION III.,"was a female, he did not give way to excessive wrath. And struck at (by"
12076,SECTION III.,"Hanumān), that ranger of the night, of a deformed face, her body"
12077,SECTION III.,"overcome, suddenly dropped to the earth. And the energetic and heroic"
12078,SECTION III.,"Hanumān, seeing her measure her length,—in consideration of her being a"
12079,SECTION III.,"female, was filled with compassion. Thereat, exceedingly agitated, Lankā"
12080,SECTION III.,"addressed the monkey, Hanumān, in humble words, with their letters"
12081,SECTION III.,"faltering,—""O mighty-armed one, be propitious unto me! Do thou save me,"
12082,SECTION III.,"O best of monkeys, O placid one. Those that are gifted with strength and"
12083,SECTION III.,"are endeued with exceeding vigor, ever bear regard unto the dignity of"

12085,SECTION III.,"gifted with wondrous strength, vanquished me myself, who am the City of"
12086,SECTION III.,"Lankā. Listen to this narration, which I, O foremost of monkeys, deliver"

12088,SECTION III.,"When a certain monkey shall by his prowess, bring thee under his sway,"
12089,SECTION III.,then shalt thou understand that a fear is come unto the Rākshahas’. And
12090,SECTION III.,"that time, O placid one, hath come unto me, in consequence of my meeting"
12091,SECTION III.,with thee. The truth ordained by the self-create knoweth no turning. The
12092,SECTION III.,destruction of the unrighteous king Rāvana together with all the
12093,SECTION III.,"Rākshasas, hath come about in consequence of Sitā (having been carried"
12094,SECTION III.,"away). Therefore, O best of monkeys, do thou enter the city ruled by"

12232,SECTION V.,"appearing clear because of his shining appearance, appeared the"

12244,SECTION V.,"(Rākshasas), some inebriate with wine and others with wealth; and"
12245,SECTION V.,abounding in cars and horses and golden seats; and fraught with the
12246,SECTION V.,"grace got of heroism. And (Rākshasas) were parleying,—moving about their"
12247,SECTION V.,"plump arms,—railing at each other; and throwing intemperate speeches at"
12248,SECTION V.,each other. And (Hanumān saw) Rākshasas striking at their chests (by way
12249,SECTION V.,"of challenge), sinking on the persons of their beloved, wearing diverse"
12250,SECTION V.,"habiliments, or stretching their tough bows. And (he) saw debonair"
12251,SECTION V.,"damsels daubing their frames with pastes; and others, again,"
12252,SECTION V.,"sleeping,—and fair-faced wenches smiling,—and others sighing hard under"

12255,SECTION V.,sighs²⁴⁸—looked exceedingly beautiful like a lake in which serpents are
12256,SECTION V.,sighing forth. And in that apartment (Hanumān) saw persons of commanding

12261,SECTION V.,rejoiced exceedingly. And he saw some having beautiful forms; and others
12262,SECTION V.,"deformed,—and both possessed of splendour. And (Hanumān) saw there their"

12264,SECTION V.,spotless character; possessing great potency; like unto stars in point
12265,SECTION V.,"of excellency of conduct,—displaying side-glances and other tokens of"
12266,SECTION V.,"dalliance, —engaged in dear drinking. And at dead of night Hanumān saw"
12267,SECTION V.,"some females blazing in beauty, affected simultaneously with bashfulness"
12268,SECTION V.,"and bliss, on being embraced by their paramours, like birds embracing"
12269,SECTION V.,their mates. And the sensible Hanumān saw there other females seated in
12270,SECTION V.,"stately halls,— lying in happiness on the laps of their lovers,—beloved"
12271,SECTION V.,"of their lords—intent on virtue,—married women,—under the influence of"
12272,SECTION V.,"Madana. And Hanumān saw some without sheets, like unto golden"
12273,SECTION V.,"streaks,—paragons among women— of the hue of molten gold,—and some of a"
12274,SECTION V.,"moon-like complexion, endeued with loveliness,—bereft of their beloved."
12275,SECTION V.,And that exceedingly heroic monkey saw females in their homes
12276,SECTION V.,experiencing the height of joy in the company of their beloved dear unto
12277,SECTION V.,their souls; charming with blossoms; filled with gladness; and
12278,SECTION V.,enchaining the hearts of their lords with their loveliness. And Hanumān
12279,SECTION V.,"saw crowds of faces like unto the Moon displayed,—with elegant eyes"
12280,SECTION V.,"furnished with lovely lashes, and side-long looks; and multitudes of"

12544,SECTION IX.,"daughter, the large eyed Sitā, that slayer of enemies, Hanumān, ranged"
12545,SECTION IX.,all through (this edifice). And Hanumān beheld the goodly edifice where
12546,SECTION IX.,the Rākshasas used to dwell in common. And (at length) that one came
12547,SECTION IX.,"upon the mansion itself of the lord of Rākshasas, having three-tusked"
12548,SECTION IX.,"and four-tusked elephants, and protected by persons with upraised arms,"
12549,SECTION IX.,and covering a capacious area. And (Hānuman beheld) the residence of
12550,SECTION IX.,"Rāvana, thronged with his Rākshasi wives, as well as with princesses"
12551,SECTION IX.,"forcibly brought thither (by him),— like unto the sea teeming with"
12552,SECTION IX.,"alligators and _makaras_, abounding in _timingilas_ and fishes and"
12553,SECTION IX.,"snakes, and agitated by the force of the wind. The same enchanting"
12554,SECTION IX.,"splendour that is in Vaiçravana or the ray-riding Moon, remained ever"
12555,SECTION IX.,constant and abiding in Rāvana’s abode. And the prosperity of king
12556,SECTION IX.,"Kuvera, or Yama, or Varuna, was here present in the house of the"
12557,SECTION IX.,"Raksha,—or even surpassed by the prosperity (of Rāvana). In the midst of"
12558,SECTION IX.,"that mansion the Wind-god’s offspring found another,²⁶¹ excellently"
12559,SECTION IX.,"constructed, having innumerable mad elephants;—that noble car"
12560,SECTION IX.,"embellished with all gems, entitled _Pushpaka_, which had been"
12561,SECTION IX.,"constructed in heaven by Viçwakarmā for Brahmā himself,— which Kuvera"
12562,SECTION IX.,"obtained from the Great-father through high austerities,—and which,"
12563,SECTION IX.,"vanquishing Kuvera by his prowess, the Rākshasa chief got possession of."
12564,SECTION IX.,"And the mighty monkey ascended the splendid car _Pushpaka_, containing"
12565,SECTION IX.,"figures of wolves,—made of _Kārttaswara_ and _Hiranya_; graced with"
12566,SECTION IX.,ranges of goodly pillars; as if blazing in splendour; throughout
12567,SECTION IX.,"garnished with narrow secret rooms and saloons, piercing the heavens,"
12568,SECTION IX.,"and resembling Meru or Mandara, and like unto the flaming Sun; skilfully"
12569,SECTION IX.,reared by Viçwakarma; with golden staircases and graceful and grand
12570,SECTION IX.,"raised seats, rows of golden and crystal windows, and daises composed of"
12571,SECTION IX.,"sapphires, emeralds and other superb gems; embellished with noble"
12572,SECTION IX.,"_vidrumas_, costly stones, and round pearls, as also with plastered"
12573,SECTION IX.,"terraces; pasted with red sandal, like unto gold, and furnished with a"
12574,SECTION IX.,sacred aroma; and resembling the sun new risen. And stationed
12575,SECTION IX.,"thereon,²⁶² Hanumān smelt the rich odour of viands and drinks that was"
12576,SECTION IX.,"spreading on all sides;— and like one dear friend smelling another, he"
12577,SECTION IX.,"also smelt the mighty Air, impregnated with aroma, which seemed like"
12578,SECTION IX.,"embodied Odour. And (the Air) said unto Hanumān,—""Come here, where that"
12579,SECTION IX.,"Rāvana is."" Then (descending from _Pushpaka_ and repairing to that"
12580,SECTION IX.,"sleeping apartment of Rāvana), Hanumān saw the same, grand and graceful;"
12581,SECTION IX.,belonging to Rāvana; of transcendent beauty; comely like unto a lovely
12582,SECTION IX.,lady; diversified with jewelled staircases; illumined with heaps of
12583,SECTION IX.,"gems; with its terraces constructed of crystal; having statues of ivory,"
12584,SECTION IX.,"pearls, diamonds, coral, silver and gold; adorned with jewelled pillars;"
12585,SECTION IX.,and embellished all round with pillasters; and upheld on all sides by
12586,SECTION IX.,"straight, elevated and gorgeously ornamented pillars of equal"
12587,SECTION IX.,"dimensions, resembling prodigious wings,—(the mansion) appearing to"
12588,SECTION IX.,tower to the sky; containing spacious and parti-colored woolen cloths
12589,SECTION IX.,"bearing the marks of the Earth;²⁶³ extensive as the Earth is, with"
12590,SECTION IX.,kingdoms and dwellings; resounding with the roars of infuriated
12591,SECTION IX.,elephants; redolent of divine fragrance; furnished with gay canopies;
12592,SECTION IX.,inhabited by the sovereign of the Rakshas; cloudy with _aguru_ and
12593,SECTION IX.,_dhupa_; spotless; of a swan-like whiteness; engarlanded with flowers
12594,SECTION IX.,and leaves like unto the dappled and brilliant cow (of Vasishtha);
12595,SECTION IX.,bringing delight unto the heart; and enhancing the grace (of all
12596,SECTION IX.,creatures); removing sorrow; noble; and the generatrix of Grace herself.
12597,SECTION IX.,"And as soon as Hanumān entered the mansion protected by Rāvana, it like"
12598,SECTION IX.,"a mother regaled his senses with their proper objects. ""This must be"
12599,SECTION IX.,"_swarga_, or the region of the immortals, or the city of Amarāvati, or"
12600,SECTION IX.,"the supreme Siddhi—""²⁶⁴ thought the Wind-god’s offspring. And he saw the"
12601,SECTION IX.,"golden lamps (shorn of their brightness),²⁶⁵ like unto gamblers worsted"
12602,SECTION IX.,"at dice by others exceedingly skilful, and, in consequence, plunged in"
12603,SECTION IX.,thought. And (Hanumān) conceived that (Rāvana’s sleeping apartment) was
12604,SECTION IX.,"in a conflagration, on account of the display of the lamps, Rāvana’ s"
12605,SECTION IX.,"energy, and the splendour of the ornaments. And when the night had been"
12606,SECTION IX.,"half spent, (Hanumān) saw thousands of superb dames, adorned in various"
12607,SECTION IX.,"attires, and bearing apparels of diverse hues, and wreaths,—who having"
12608,SECTION IX.,"given up sport, and come under the influence of wine and sleep,— were"
12609,SECTION IX.,fast asleep on woolen sheets. And in consequence of the silence that
12610,SECTION IX.,"reigned (in that apartment) embellished with (ornaments), it resembled a"
12611,SECTION IX.,"large lotus-grove, where the swans and the black bees are silent. And"
12612,SECTION IX.,the Wind-god’s offspring beheld the countenances of those beauteous
12613,SECTION IX.,"women, with closed eyes,—having their lashes shut through languor; and"
12614,SECTION IX.,odorous with lotus-perfume. And their faces appeared like lotuses
12615,SECTION IX.,"blowing on the expiry of night and closing their petals by night. ""These"
12616,SECTION IX.,"lotus-faces like unto very lotuses themselves, ever the six-footed"
12617,SECTION IX.,"ones²⁶⁶ seek once and again."" Thus thought with discrimination the"
12618,SECTION IX.,"graceful, mighty monkey; and on account of their perfections, he"
12619,SECTION IX.,confessed those countenances to be equal to water-sprung²⁶⁷ (lotuses).
12620,SECTION IX.,"And that apartment, in consequence of being graced by those women,"
12621,SECTION IX.,"appeared splendid, like the autumnal, complacent sky decorated with the"
12622,SECTION IX.,"stars. And surrounded by them, the Rākshasa chief resembled the fair"
12623,SECTION IX.,"Moon encircled by the stars. ""Those stars that drop from the firmament"
12624,SECTION IX.,"on their virtue deteriorating, have assembled here in a body,"" thus"
12625,SECTION IX.,"thought the monkey at that time. And the shine, form, and splendour of"
12626,SECTION IX.,"those females resembled, forsooth those of magnificently displayed,"
12627,SECTION IX.,noble and lustrous stars. And on account of their having been bereft of
12628,SECTION IX.,"consciousness through sleep, induced by fatigue brought on by drink (and"
12629,SECTION IX.,"dance), their hair was dishevelled, and their full wreaths and goodly"
12630,SECTION IX.,ornaments lay scattered about. And some of those paragons had got their
12631,SECTION IX.,"beauty-spots, smudged; and some, their bangles loosening off; some,"
12632,SECTION IX.,their chains running to one side. And others had their pearl necklaces
12633,SECTION IX.,"burst,— and their cloths getting away (from their persons), and the"
12634,SECTION IX.,chains of their zones straying irregularly;—resembling way-worn mares.
12635,SECTION IX.,"And others again were without their ear-rings, and had their garlands"
12636,SECTION IX.,"torn and crushed; and resembled blossoming creepers, trodden down in a"
12637,SECTION IX.,vast forest by mighty elephants. And the pearl chains of some sinning
12638,SECTION IX.,"females resembling moon beams, having got topsy-turvy, was lying like"
12639,SECTION IX.,sleeping swans between the breasts of the damsels. And the lapis chains
12640,SECTION IX.,of some resembled water-crows;²⁶⁸ and the fine golden chains turned
12641,SECTION IX.,upside down of others appeared like ruddy geese. And those ladies
12642,SECTION IX.,"resembled rivers having hips for banks; containing swans and Karandavas,"
12643,SECTION IX.,and beautified with ruddy geese. And those sleeping females appeared
12644,SECTION IX.,like streams; having _Kinkinis_ for their ripples; and large gold
12645,SECTION IX.,lotuses;²⁶⁹ marks²⁷⁰ of amorous encounter on their persons for ferocious
12646,SECTION IX.,"aquatic animals; and perfections,²⁷¹ for their banks. And on the tender"
12647,SECTION IX.,"frames, as well as on the tops of the breasts, of some graceful"
12648,SECTION IX.,"scratches consequent on pressure, appeared like ornaments. And the"
12649,SECTION IX.,scarf-ends of some stirred by the air that was blowing about their
12650,SECTION IX.,"faces, flapped on them again and again. And at the nether part of the"
12651,SECTION IX.,"faces of Rāvana’s wives, they (the scarf-ends)appeared beauteous like"
12652,SECTION IX.,"uplifted streamers of exceeding elegance, composed of many-hued golden"
12653,SECTION IX.,"yarn. And the ear-rings of some dames possessed of a pleasant sheen,"
12654,SECTION IX.,"stirred by the air that was breathing about their faces, were undulating"
12655,SECTION IX.,"gently. And the sweet breath of their faces, naturally fragrant, and"
12656,SECTION IX.,"redolent of sugar and dsava, was then regaling Rāvana. And out of fear"
12657,SECTION IX.,"sprung from sleep and intoxication, some of Rāvana’s wives were again"
12658,SECTION IX.,"and again smelling the faces of those, co-wives with them, taking the"
12659,SECTION IX.,faces to belong to Rāvana. And from their hearts being firmly fixed on
12660,SECTION IX.,"Rāvana, those excellent women, having their sense af separateness"
12661,SECTION IX.,"removed, (albeit thus dealt with), did what was dear unto them.²⁷² And"
12662,SECTION IX.,"other females, making their gay scarf-ends (for their sheets), and"
12663,SECTION IX.,"making their arms, their pillows, were lying down there. And some were"
12664,SECTION IX.,"lying on others’ bosoms and others again, on the arms of the latter. And"
12665,SECTION IX.,"some lay on the laps of others; and others, again, on the breasts of the"
12666,SECTION IX.,"latter. And they reposed on each other’s thighs, flanks, waists, and"
12667,SECTION IX.,"backs; and coming under the influence of wine and amour, they lay on"
12668,SECTION IX.,"each other’s persons. And those females having elegant waists, receiving"
12669,SECTION IX.,"pleasure from the contact with others’ persons, were sleeping there,"
12670,SECTION IX.,with their hands fastened by each other. And that garland of females
12671,SECTION IX.,"strung by the threads of their hands, appeared beauteous, like a real"
12672,SECTION IX.,"wreath strung on a thread, with maddened black bees (seated thereon)."
12673,SECTION IX.,And that multitude of females in a medley appeared like an assemblage of
12674,SECTION IX.,"blooming plants in the month of Chaitra,²⁷³ with its wreaths formed in"
12675,SECTION IX.,"consequence of their coming in contact with one another, and of its"
12676,SECTION IX.,"clusters touching each other, on account of the breeze blowing;—with the"
12677,SECTION IX.,"plants encircling the graceful (necks of the trees),—and rife with"
12678,SECTION IX.,Bhramaras chasing each other.—And although the ornaments of those women
12679,SECTION IX.,"wearing ornaments, attires and wreaths, were put on proper places; yet"
12680,SECTION IX.,"(on account of the profusion of the ornaments themselves, as well as"
12681,SECTION IX.,"because of the circumstance of the dames’ sleeping),²⁷⁴ it was difficult"
12682,SECTION IX.,to ascertain which ornament belonged to one damsel and which to another.
12683,SECTION IX.,"And it seemed as if, Rāvana having attained rest (through sleep), the"
12684,SECTION IX.,"flaming golden lamps furnished with various rays, were gazing at the"
12685,SECTION IX.,"girls with winkless eyes. Daughters of Rājarshis, of Vipras, of Daityas,"
12686,SECTION IX.,"of Gandharbas. and of Rākshasas, having come under the influence of"
12687,SECTION IX.,"desire, had become his wives. And all those women had been procured by"
12688,SECTION IX.,Rāvana because he sought fight (with their relations) and some haughty
12689,SECTION IX.,"dames, rapt with desire, had of themselves come to this place. And there"
12690,SECTION IX.,"was no woman there, who had been won by force by (Rāvana), possessed as"
12691,SECTION IX.,he was of prowess; but they had all been subdued by his qualities. And
12692,SECTION IX.,"save the surpassingly worthy daughter of Janaka, no female (had been"
12693,SECTION IX.,"brought), who had set her heart on another, or who had known any other"
12694,SECTION IX.,"before. And there was none who, being his wife, was not of high"
12695,SECTION IX.,extraction; none who was defective in grace; none who was not of
12696,SECTION IX.,sterling merit; none who was not decked out in ornaments and attire; and
12697,SECTION IX.,none who was infirm; and none who was not an object of desire of her
12698,SECTION IX.,"lover. And the lord of monkeys endowed with uprightness of sense,"
12699,SECTION IX.,"thought,—""If the righteously wedded wife of Rāghava were as one of the"
12700,SECTION IX.,"wives of the king of the Rākshasas, it would well for him."" Again"
12701,SECTION IX.,"reflected he,— ""Sitā is crowned with chastity and other virtues; and the"
12702,SECTION IX.,"powerful lord of Lankā, assuming an illusory form, hath with much ado"
12703,SECTION IX.,"perpetrated this ignominious act."""

12848,SECTION X.,an excellent bed; adorned with ornaments containing pearls and jewels;
12849,SECTION X.,and as if decorating that charming mansion with her grace. And the
12850,SECTION X.,"monkey saw there the yellow-hued Mandodari, having the splendour of"
12851,SECTION X.,"gold; the object of (Rāvana’s) desire; beautiful exceedingly,—the"
12852,SECTION X.,"mistress of the inner apartment,—lying down. And seeing (Mandodari)"
12853,SECTION X.,"adorned with ornaments, the offspring of the Wind-god guessed,—""This one"
12854,SECTION X.,"endowed with the wealth of youth and beauty might be Sitā."" And"
12855,SECTION X.,"demonstrating great joy, that leader of monkey-bands rejoiced"
12856,SECTION X.,"exceedingly. And thereat, (Hanumān) struck at his arms with his hands,"
12857,SECTION X.,"kissed his tail, exhibited signs of glee, frolicked, sang, darted"
12858,SECTION X.,"towards the pillars, shot up to the top thereof, and jumped down to the"

12883,SECTION XI.,"Then resigning that line of thought,²⁸² that mighty monkey, regaining"
12884,SECTION XI.,"his equanimity, set out in another direction of thought touching Sitā."
12885,SECTION XI.,"""Separated from Rāma, that lady is incapable²⁸³ of of sleeping, or"
12886,SECTION XI.,"eating, or decorating (her person), or drinking. And she is incapable of"
12887,SECTION XI.,"associating with any other person, although he were the sovereign of the"
12888,SECTION XI.,celestials himself. And even in all heaven there is none who is equal to
12889,SECTION XI.,"Rāma. She is some other."" Assuring himself of this, that foremost of"
12890,SECTION XI.,"monkeys, eager to behold Sitā, again began to range in that place set"
12891,SECTION XI.,apart for drinking. Some were tired out with sporting; some with
12892,SECTION XI.,singing; some with dancing; and some were fast asleep through
12893,SECTION XI.,"intoxication. And some supported themselves on _murajas_, _mridangas_,"
12894,SECTION XI.,or _chelikas_; and some women were sleeping on excellent sheets. And
12895,SECTION XI.,that leader of monkey-bands saw (that place of drinking) filled with
12896,SECTION XI.,"thousands of women, adorned with ornaments engaged (in their sleep) in"
12897,SECTION XI.,depicting each other’s loveliness; and explaining the sense of songs;
12898,SECTION XI.,conversant with season and place; understanding the meanings of words
12899,SECTION XI.,chiming in with season and place²⁸⁴; and skilful at play. And at other
12900,SECTION XI.,"places also he saw thousands of superb and youthful dames fast asleep,—"
12901,SECTION XI.,employed in talking of each others beauty. And that leader of monkey
12902,SECTION XI.,"bands saw (women) versed in season and place, and understanding the"
12903,SECTION XI.,meanings of words consonant with season and place. And in the midst of
12904,SECTION XI.,"them all, the lord of the Rākshasas looked splendid like an ox in a"
12905,SECTION XI.,"spacious stall in the midst of stately kine. And surrounded by them, the"
12906,SECTION XI.,"Rākshasa chief appeared beautiful like a gigantic elephant in a forest,"
12907,SECTION XI.,surrounded by female elephants. And in the abode of the huge-bodied
12908,SECTION XI.,"Rākshasa chief, this tiger-like monkey saw that place of drinking,"
12909,SECTION XI.,furnished with every object of desire. And in that place set apart for
12910,SECTION XI.,"drinking, he saw heaps of the flesh of buffaloes, deer, and boars,"
12911,SECTION XI.,arranged separately. And that tiger-like monkey saw in capacious golden
12912,SECTION XI.,"vessels flesh of fowls and peacocks, which remained (after the repast)."
12913,SECTION XI.,"And Hanumān saw the flesh of boars, and _Vādhrinasas_²⁸⁵ _Sulyas_, deer,"
12914,SECTION XI.,"and peacocks, seasoned with curds and _Sauvarchala_;²⁸⁶ and"
12915,SECTION XI.,"_Krikalas_,²⁸⁷ and goats of various kinds.-flesh of hare"
12916,SECTION XI.,"half-fed,—_Ekaçalyas_,²⁸⁸ and buffaloes,—all chopped and dressed; and"
12917,SECTION XI.,lickable and drinkable viands sharp and mild; and edibles sharp and
12918,SECTION XI.,"mild; and _Rāgakhāndavas_²⁸⁹ containing sugar and acid, capable of"
12919,SECTION XI.,improving a vicious palate. And with large and costly stray bangles and
12920,SECTION XI.,"bracelets; and scattered cans,— and diverse kinds of fruit; and wreaths"
12921,SECTION XI.,"of flowers, the pavement attained exceeding beauty. And with elegantly"
12922,SECTION XI.,"jointed bedsteads, arranged (around), the scene of wassail appeared"
12923,SECTION XI.,"aflame without fire. And with meat consisting of many ingredients,"
12924,SECTION XI.,"fraught with diverse tastes, seasoned with many substances, and dressed"
12925,SECTION XI.,"by skilful cooks,—arranged separately in the scene of revel; and with"
12926,SECTION XI.,"noble and pleasant wines, natural²⁹⁰ and artificial,—_āsavas_ from"
12927,SECTION XI.,sugar; and _Mādhvika_²⁹¹ and _āsavas_ from flowers and fruits; and
12928,SECTION XI.,"impregnated separately with different kinds of fragrant dust,—the"
12929,SECTION XI.,"pavement, furnished with inuumerable garlands, surrounded with golden"
12930,SECTION XI.,"water-vessels and crystal bowls, and golden water-pots, looked"
12931,SECTION XI.,exceedingly beautiful. And the monkey saw that foremost of all places
12932,SECTION XI.,"set apart for drinking, containing silvern and golden jars. And that"
12933,SECTION XI.,"mighty monkey saw golden wine-vessels studded with gems, all filled with"
12934,SECTION XI.,"wine; and some with half full of liquor, some with their wine entirely"
12935,SECTION XI.,"exhausted, and some full of liquor. And (at some spots) he saw various"
12936,SECTION XI.,"kinds of viands, and at others wines ranged in rows, and at others the"
12937,SECTION XI.,wine-vessels remaining half full. And there were many bedsteads
12938,SECTION XI.,"belonging to fair ones, remaining vacant; and at some places excellent"
12939,SECTION XI.,"women were sleeping touching each other. And at one place, a female,"
12940,SECTION XI.,"borne down by the force of sleep, forcibly possessing herself of"
12941,SECTION XI.,"another’s cloth, and wrapping herself therewith,—went to the bed of that"
12942,SECTION XI.,"one, and was indulging in sleep.—And with their breath, their variegated"
12943,SECTION XI.,"wreaths and the cloth on their persons were stirring gently, as if with"
12944,SECTION XI.,a mild-blowing breeze. And laden with the odours of cool sandal and of
12945,SECTION XI.,"sweet-tasting _Sidhu_;²⁹² and of diverse wreaths and flowers, and with"
12946,SECTION XI.,"perfumes of various kinds,—and entranced²⁹³ with (the aroma of _sandals_"
12947,SECTION XI.,"suitable for use after ablution, and of _dhupas_, the air, impregnated"
12948,SECTION XI.,"with excellent scent, was there breathing around the car Pushpaka. And"
12949,SECTION XI.,"in the residence of the Raksha, there were some wenches sable, yet"
12950,SECTION XI.,exceedingly witching; and some were dark-hued; and the frames of some
12951,SECTION XI.,"were of a golden brilliance. And their beauty, in consequence of their"
12952,SECTION XI.,"coming under the governance of sleep, and their being bereft of their"
12953,SECTION XI.,"senses by Madana, resembled that of lotuses in a sleep. Thus that highly"
12954,SECTION XI.,energetic monkey saw everything thoroughly in the inner apartment of
12955,SECTION XI.,"Rāvana,—but he saw not Janaka’s daughter. And seeing those females, that"
12956,SECTION XI.,"mighty monkey, apprehending loss of righteousness, was seized with an"
12957,SECTION XI.,"exceeding great fear²⁹⁴. ""Beholding a female, who is the religiously"
12958,SECTION XI.,"wedded wife of another, while she is asleep²⁹⁵, verily causeth loss of"
12959,SECTION XI.,righteousness. My sight surely never seeketh others’ wives; but I have
12960,SECTION XI.,"beheld this one that hath ravished another’s spouse."" And that"
12961,SECTION XI.,"intelligent one, intent on attaining a knowledge of things capable of"
12962,SECTION XI.,"being arrived at on grounds of judgment, again reflected effectively as"
12963,SECTION XI.,"to his course of action: ""All these unsuspecting wives of Rāvana have"
12964,SECTION XI.,been beheld by me; yet there are no signs that my mind hath undergone
12965,SECTION XI.,any alteration. In respect of the enlistment of the senses on behalf of
12966,SECTION XI.,"any course of action good or evil, it is verily mind which is the cause;"
12967,SECTION XI.,and herein my mind is righteously disposed. And I could not search for
12968,SECTION XI.,"Vaidehi elsewhere; for in the matter of search, people always search for"
12969,SECTION XI.,women even among women. And people search for creatures among the
12970,SECTION XI.,species to which they happen to belong: none searcheth for a lost lady
12971,SECTION XI.,among female deer. Therefore have I with a pure heart explored the
12972,SECTION XI.,"entire inner apartment of Rāvana; but Janaka’s daughter I see not."" And"
12973,SECTION XI.,"Hanumān endowed with prowess saw the daughters of gods, and Gandharbas,"
12974,SECTION XI.,"and Nāgas; hut he saw not Jānaki. And not seeing her, that hero, having"
12975,SECTION XI.,"beheld other magnificent dames, coming out of that place, set about"
12976,SECTION XI.,"searching for Sitā (afresh). And leaving the place of wassail, the"
12977,SECTION XI.,"graceful offspring of the Wind-god, taking extreme care, again began to"
12978,SECTION XI.,search for Sitā all about (another quarter).

13024,SECTION XII.,"And remaining in that mansion, (Hanumān) desirous of getting a sight of"
13025,SECTION XII.,"Sitā graced with a fair presence, went into bowers, and picture"
13026,SECTION XII.,"galleries, and night-houses;²⁹⁶ but her he did not find. And not finding"
13027,SECTION XII.,"the beloved (spouse) of Raghu’s son, that mighty monkey"
13028,SECTION XII.,"reflected,—""Surely Sitā is not alive,—for although I have searched"
13029,SECTION XII.,"(through and through), yet Mithilā’s daughter I have failed to find. And"
13030,SECTION XII.,"that girl solicitous for the preservation of her chastity, and staying"
13031,SECTION XII.,"in the prime path of virtuous woman,—that chaste one—hath, for certain,"
13032,SECTION XII.,"been slain by this chief of the Rākshasas, (ever) finding delight in"
13033,SECTION XII.,"iniquity. And seeing the wives of the Rākshasa monarch,—of frightful"
13034,SECTION XII.,"forms,— monstrous; of lurid hue; having huge faces; with large horrid"
13035,SECTION XII.,"eyes,—the daughter of Janaka hath given up the ghost from fright."
13036,SECTION XII.,"Failing to see Sitā, and (thereby) annuling my prowess, and having long"
13037,SECTION XII.,"spent the appointed space in company with the monkeys, way have I none"
13038,SECTION XII.,"to present myself before Sugriva, that monkey being puissant and given"
13039,SECTION XII.,to meting out sharp chastisement. Having searched the inner apartment
13040,SECTION XII.,"through, and seen the wives of the Rākshasa, I do not see the chaste"
13041,SECTION XII.,"Sitā. Therefore vain is the trouble that I take. What, alas! shall the"
13042,SECTION XII.,"monkeys assembled tell me when I shall go (to them)? ’O hero, tell us"
13043,SECTION XII.,"what thou hast done, repairing there.’ And not having seen Janaka’s"
13044,SECTION XII.,"daughter, what shall I answer? The term fixed (by Sugriva) having been"
13045,SECTION XII.,"past, certainly meet it is that I should fast to death. And what shall"
13046,SECTION XII.,"the aged Jambhavān, and what shall Angada, say? And what, again, shall"
13047,SECTION XII.,the assembled monkeys say to me when I shall have crossed over the main?
13048,SECTION XII.,But perseverence is the source of good fortune; and perseverence
13049,SECTION XII.,"bringeth about supreme happiness. Search again I will, where I have not"
13050,SECTION XII.,"yet searched. Perseverence, for certain, ever bringeth people to all"
13051,SECTION XII.,"profitable objects. Whatever one doeth with vigor, beareth fruit."
13052,SECTION XII.,Therefore will I put forth fresh dear efforts vigorously. I will search
13053,SECTION XII.,such places held by Rāvana as I have not yet seen. I have again searched
13054,SECTION XII.,"the picture-galleries and the sporting-structures, and edifices, and"
13055,SECTION XII.,"roads passing through gardens, as well as the cars."" Having thought"
13056,SECTION XII.,"thus, Hanumān again set about searching the subterranean abodes,"
13057,SECTION XII.,"religious buildings, and many-storied mansions. And flying up, and"
13058,SECTION XII.,"coming down, and staying, and going at places, and opening doors, and"
13059,SECTION XII.,"shutting others, and entering and issuing out, and falling down as if"
13060,SECTION XII.,"darting up, that mighty monkey began to range on all sides. There was"
13061,SECTION XII.,"not even space measuring four fingers in that inner apartment of Rāvana,"
13062,SECTION XII.,to which the monkey did not repair. And he saw the abodes of the
13063,SECTION XII.,"nobility, the daises, the trees by the crossings the holes, and the"
13064,SECTION XII.,"tanks. And Hanumān saw there Rākshasas of various forms, frightful and"
13065,SECTION XII.,deformed; but he saw not Janaka’s daughter. And Hanumān saw there the
13066,SECTION XII.,wives of Vidyādharas; but he saw not Rāghava’s beloved. And Hanumān saw
13067,SECTION XII.,there transcendentally beautiful women—daughters of Nāgas—having
13068,SECTION XII.,countenances resembling the moon; but he saw not Janaka’s daughter. And
13069,SECTION XII.,Hanumān saw there daughters of Nāgas forcibly brought by the lord of the
13070,SECTION XII.,Rākshasas; but he saw not Janaka’s daughter. Having seen other beauteous
13071,SECTION XII.,"females, and not seeing her, the mighty-armed son of the Wind-god was"
13072,SECTION XII.,oppressed with sadness. Seeing that the endeavours of the monarch of
13073,SECTION XII.,"monkeys, as well as the bounding over the main, had come to nought, the"
13074,SECTION XII.,offspring of the Wind-god was plunged in thought. Descending from the
13075,SECTION XII.,"aerial car, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god, his senses deprived by"
13076,SECTION XII.,"sorrow, was again wrought up with anxiety."
13077,SECTION XII.,
13078,SECTION XII.,²⁹⁶ Intended for stay at night.—T.

13084,SECTION XIII.,
13085,SECTION XIII.,"Allighting from the car, Hanumān possessed of vigorous activity,—leader"
13086,SECTION XIII.,"of monkey-bands—nearing the wall, looked like lightning within a mass of"
13087,SECTION XIII.,"clouds.²⁹⁷ And having gone round the mansions of Rāvana, and not seeing"
13088,SECTION XIII.,"Jānaki, the monkey Hanumān said,—""Striving after Rāma’s welfare, I have"
13089,SECTION XIII.,"again searched through Lankā; but I do not see Videha’s daughter,"
13090,SECTION XIII.,"Jānaki, having all her limbs endeued with loveliness. And I have"
13091,SECTION XIII.,"explored pools, and watery expanses, and tanks, and rivers, and streams,"
13092,SECTION XIII.,"and marshes, and woods, and citadels, and mountains, yea,—all this"
13093,SECTION XIII.,earth; but Jānaki I do not find. The vulture-king Sampati had told that
13094,SECTION XIII.,Sitā was in the mansion of Rāvana. But why do I not see her (here)? Or
13095,SECTION XIII.,"doth Maithili Sitā, daughter unto Janaka,²⁹⁸ sprung in the Videha line,"
13096,SECTION XIII.,"forcibly carried off (by Rāvana) and completely in his power, abide by"
13097,SECTION XIII.,"the mandate (of that monarch)? I conceive that while taking Sitā, the"
13098,SECTION XIII.,"Raksha darted upward, he being influenced by fear of Rāma’s shafts; (and"
13099,SECTION XIII.,"accordingly losing control over his movements), she fell off by the way."
13100,SECTION XIII.,Or I fancy that while that noble lady was being carried away along the
13101,SECTION XIII.,"way ranged by Siddhas, she lost her life on beholding the ocean. Or I"
13102,SECTION XIII.,"think that on account of the vehement speed assumed by Rāvana, and also"
13103,SECTION XIII.,"oppressed with his arms, that large-eyed noble lady hath been bereft of"
13104,SECTION XIII.,"her life. For certain, while (Rāvana) was soaring higher and higher,"
13105,SECTION XIII.,"Janaka’s daughter, rolling (on the car), dropped down into the sea."
13106,SECTION XIII.,"Alas! trying to preserve her chastity. the forlorn Sitā, practising"
13107,SECTION XIII.,"self-mortification, hath been devoured by this abject-minded Rāvana. Or"
13108,SECTION XIII.,"that dark-eyed innocent one, hath been eaten up by tbe wives of the"
13109,SECTION XIII.,"Rākshasa chief, actuated by wicked motives.²⁹⁹ (Ever) contemplating"
13110,SECTION XIII.,"Rāma’s countenance, resembling the full Moon, with eyes like"
13111,SECTION XIII.,"lotus-leaves, she, exercised with sorrow, hath breathed her last."
13112,SECTION XIII.,Bewailing much with exclamations of ’Oh Rāma and Lakshmana!’ ’Ah
13113,SECTION XIII.,Ayodhyā!’ that lady Vaidehi hath renounced her body. Or secretly kept in
13114,SECTION XIII.,"Rāvana’s mansion, that girl, like a female parrot in a cage, is weeping"
13115,SECTION XIII.,"bitterly. How can the slender-waisted wife of Rāma, born in the race of"
13116,SECTION XIII.,"Janaka, furnished with eyes resembling lotus petals, come under the sway"
13117,SECTION XIII.,of Rāvana? I shall not be able to say of Rāma’s beloved wife that she
13118,SECTION XIII.,"hath been sullied,³⁰⁰ or that I have seen her, or yet that she is dead."
13119,SECTION XIII.,To say this is censurable; not to say it is also such. What is my
13120,SECTION XIII.,course? I find myself in a false position. Things having drifted to this
13121,SECTION XIII.,"pass, what should I say, now that the time hath come?’ Thus thinking,"
13122,SECTION XIII.,"Hanumān again reflected,—""If without seeing Sitā, I repair to the abode"
13123,SECTION XIII.,"of the lord of monkeys, what then shall I gain as the object of my"
13124,SECTION XIII.,exertions? This my bounding over the main comes to nought; as also my
13125,SECTION XIII.,entry into Lankā and the sight of the Rākshasas. And what shall Sugriva
13126,SECTION XIII.,say? Or the assembled monkeys; or those twin sons of Daçaratha; to me
13127,SECTION XIII.,"when I shall have come to Kishkindhā? And if going there, I should say a"
13128,SECTION XIII.,harsh speech unto Kākutstha—’I have not seen Sitā’—he shall renounce his
13129,SECTION XIII.,"life. Hearing harsh, terrible, unsufferable, fierce and foul words"
13130,SECTION XIII.,"concerning Sitā, calculated to set the senses on fire, he shall not"
13131,SECTION XIII.,"exist. And seeing him come under misery, with his mind expiring, the"
13132,SECTION XIII.,"intelligent Lakshmana, firmly attached (unto Rāma), shall also cease to"
13133,SECTION XIII.,"exist. And hearing that his two brothers are dead, Bharata also shall"
13134,SECTION XIII.,"give up existence. And seeing Bharata dead, Satrughna shall also"
13135,SECTION XIII.,"renounce his life. And beholding their sons dead, their mothers,"
13136,SECTION XIII.,"Kauçalyā, Sumitrā and Kaikayi, shall, certainly, resign their lives. And"
13137,SECTION XIII.,"seeing Rāma in that plight, the lord of the monkeys, Sugriva, grateful"
13138,SECTION XIII.,"and having his heart fast fixed in truth, shall give up his life. And"
13139,SECTION XIII.,"Umā, aggrieved, heart-wrung, distressed and bereft of happiness, and"
13140,SECTION XIII.,"assuming the garb of a female ascetic, because of grief for her husband,"
13141,SECTION XIII.,"shall resign her existence. And oppressed with grief arising from Vāli,"
13142,SECTION XIII.,"and weighed down by sorrow, the queen Tārā, also, resolving on death"
13143,SECTION XIII.,shall cease to exist. And in consequence of the death of his father and
13144,SECTION XIII.,"mother and the calamity befalling Sugriva, the prince Angada also shall"
13145,SECTION XIII.,next forego his existence. And the dwellers of the woods overwhelmed
13146,SECTION XIII.,"with grief got of (the decease of) their master, shall strike at their"
13147,SECTION XIII.,heads with their clenched fists and hands. And the monkeys
13148,SECTION XIII.,affectionately cherished by the famous lord of the monkeys with soothing
13149,SECTION XIII.,"words gifts and regard, shall resign there lives. And no more in woods,"
13150,SECTION XIII.,"and rocks, or secret spots, shall the foremost monkeys, assembled"
13151,SECTION XIII.,"together, indulge in sports. And they, along with their sons and wives,"
13152,SECTION XIII.,"and counsellors, distressed on account the disaster that hath overtaken"
13153,SECTION XIII.,"their master,—shall fall from the tops of mountains down to places even"
13154,SECTION XIII.,"or uneven. And the monkeys shall take poison, or hang themselves, or"
13155,SECTION XIII.,"enter into flaming fire, or fast, or fall on their own weapons. I fancy"
13156,SECTION XIII.,that a loud wailing shall arise on my return (to that place); and the
13157,SECTION XIII.,race of Ikshwāku as well as the rangers of the woods shall meet with
13158,SECTION XIII.,destruction. Therefore I will not repair hence to the city of
13159,SECTION XIII.,Kishkindhā; nor can I see Sugriva without Mithilā’s daughter. On my not
13160,SECTION XIII.,"going there and staying here, those righteous-souled Mahārathas as well"
13161,SECTION XIII.,"as the fast-fleeting monkeys, shall preserve their lives through hope"
13162,SECTION XIII.,(of hearing tidings concerning Sitā.) And not having seen Janaka’s
13163,SECTION XIII.,"daughter, I will lead the _Vānaprastha_ mode of life, partaking (of"
13164,SECTION XIII.,"fruits) falling into my hands or mouth, restraining my senses, and"
13165,SECTION XIII.,staying at the foot of trees. Preparing a funereal pile on a tract
13166,SECTION XIII.,"bordering on the sea, abounding in fruits, and flowers, and water, I"
13167,SECTION XIII.,"will enter into flaming fire. And as I sit to fast, and for effecting"
13168,SECTION XIII.,the separation of self from my body and centering my identity in the
13169,SECTION XIII.,spirit crows and beasts of prey shall feed on my body. And I think the
13170,SECTION XIII.,"sages have enjoyed another way of exit. I shall, failing to see Janaki,"
13171,SECTION XIII.,"enter into water. My illustrious and exalted garland of fame, begot of"
13172,SECTION XIII.,"excellent acts, hath perished for good in consequence of my not seeing"
13173,SECTION XIII.,"Sitā.³⁰¹ Or restraining myself, I shall become an ascetic living"
13174,SECTION XIII.,"underneath trees; but return I will not, without obtaining a sight of"
13175,SECTION XIII.,"that dark-eyed damsel. If I return without seeing Sitā, all the monkeys"
13176,SECTION XIII.,with Angada shall cease to exist. Incalculable are the ills of my
13177,SECTION XIII.,"putting a period to my existence; (on the other hand) if I live, I may"
13178,SECTION XIII.,"come by good. Therefore my life I will maintain. If I live, it may"
13179,SECTION XIII.,"conduce to happiness."" Having thus indulged in a variety of harassing"
13180,SECTION XIII.,"thoughts in his mind, that foremost of monkeys could not cross over to"
13181,SECTION XIII.,"the other shore (of the sea of distress). Then summoning energy, that"
13182,SECTION XIII.,"elephantine monkey endeued with fortitude reflected,— ""Or I shall slay"
13183,SECTION XIII.,the Ten-necked Rāvana possessed of great strength. Sitā hath been
13184,SECTION XIII.,carried off; but by this I shall avenge myself. Or throwing him
13185,SECTION XIII.,"repeatedly into the sea, I (shall take him) and present him to Rāma,"
13186,SECTION XIII.,"even as one presents a beast unto Paçupat.""³⁰² Reflecting thus, the"
13187,SECTION XIII.,"monkey, not finding Sitā, —agitated with sorrow and anxiety,"
13188,SECTION XIII.,"thought,—""So long as I do not find the illustrious spouse of Rāma, Sitā,"
13189,SECTION XIII.,I will explore the city of Lankā again and again. If in consonance with
13190,SECTION XIII.,"Simpāt’s speech, I bring Rāma hither, Rāghava, not seeing his wife,"
13191,SECTION XIII.,"shall burn all the monkeys. (Therefore) even here I shall stay,"
13192,SECTION XIII.,restraining my fare and mortifying my senses. All those principal
13193,SECTION XIII.,monkeys ought not to lose their lives because of any act to which I may
13194,SECTION XIII.,"commit myself. This is the asoka wood, extensive and containing mighty"
13195,SECTION XIII.,"trees. This I shall explore, as it hath not yet been searched by me. And"
13196,SECTION XIII.,"saluting the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, the twin Açwins, (and Rāma"
13197,SECTION XIII.,"and Lakshmana), I enhancing the sorrow of the Rākhas, shall go into it."
13198,SECTION XIII.,"Having vanquished the Rākshas, I will bestow on Rāma the lady of the"
13199,SECTION XIII.,"Ikshwāku race like the fruit of asceticism conferred on an ascetic."""
13200,SECTION XIII.,"Having thus reflected for a space, the mighty-armed offspring of the"
13201,SECTION XIII.,"Wind-god, his senses agitated with anxiety, arose. ""I bow unto Rāma with"
13202,SECTION XIII.,"Lakshmana, and unto the revered daughter of Janaka, I bow unto Rudra,"
13203,SECTION XIII.,"and Indra, and Yama, and Wind-god, and I bow unto the Moon, unto Fire"
13204,SECTION XIII.,"and unto the Maruts."" Having bowed unto them all, as also unto Sugriva,"
13205,SECTION XIII.,"the offspring of the Wind-god, surveying all the cardinal points,"
13206,SECTION XIII.,mentally entered the _Asoka_ wood. Having mentally entered the _Asoka_
13207,SECTION XIII.,"wood, that monkey, son unto the Wind-god, reflected as to what he should"
13208,SECTION XIII.,"do next. The sacred _Asoka_ wood, sanctified with every purifying rite"
13209,SECTION XIII.,"and abounding in woods, needs must be full of Rākshas. And warders,"
13210,SECTION XIII.,"directed there to, forsooth, protect the trees; and that worshipful Soul"
13211,SECTION XIII.,of the universe³⁰³ does not breathe here vigorously. I contract my
13212,SECTION XIII.,"person in the interests of Rāma, and in order that Rāvana may not see"
13213,SECTION XIII.,me. May all the deities along with the saints confer success on me. And
13214,SECTION XIII.,"may the revered self-create Brahmā, and the deities, and the ascetics,"
13215,SECTION XIII.,"and Fire, and wind, and the much invoked bearer of the _Vajra_,³⁰⁴ and"
13216,SECTION XIII.,"the noose-handed Varuna, and the Moon and the Sun, the high-souled"
13217,SECTION XIII.,"Açwinis, and all the Maruts—(confer) success (on me)! And all beings,"
13218,SECTION XIII.,"and the lord of them all,³⁰⁵ and others that, albeit not specified in"
13219,SECTION XIII.,"the scriptures, are yet visible in the way,—will confer success on me."
13220,SECTION XIII.,"When shall I behold the blameless face of that noble lady,—with its"
13221,SECTION XIII.,"protruding nose; having luminous smiles, having eyes resembling"
13222,SECTION XIII.,lotus-petals; and bright as the complacent lord of stars? Ah! to-day how
13223,SECTION XIII.,shall feeble forlorn one that hath been borne down by the force of the

13258,SECTION XIV.,"Having reflected for a while, and mentally met with her, that highly"
13259,SECTION XIV.,energetic one leapt from the wall of Rāvana’s mansion on to that (of the
13260,SECTION XIV.,"_Asoka_ wood). And all his frame filled with delight, that mighty"
13261,SECTION XIV.,"monkey, stationed on the wall, saw various trees having their tops"
13262,SECTION XIV.,"furnished with flowers through spring and the other seasons,—_salas_ and"
13263,SECTION XIV.,"_asokas_, _bhavyas_, _champakas_, _udalakas_, and _nāgas_, and those"
13264,SECTION XIV.,bearing fruits resembling the mouths of monkeys; and those relative to
13265,SECTION XIV.,mango woods.—with hundreds of plants. And (Hanumān) leapt into the
13266,SECTION XIV.,garden like an arrow let go from the bow string. Entering into the
13267,SECTION XIV.,"grove, variegated all over; resonant with the notes of birds; filled on"
13268,SECTION XIV.,all sides with golden and silvern trees; many-hued with birds and
13269,SECTION XIV.,"beasts; containing dainty tracts of trees like unto the risen Sun,—the"
13270,SECTION XIV.,"powerful Hanumān saw the place surrounded with various kinds of trees,"
13271,SECTION XIV.,"having fruits and flowers; frequented by maddened coels and _bhramaras_,"
13272,SECTION XIV.,"with creatures expressing happiness by their movements, birds and beasts"
13273,SECTION XIV.,overflowing with spirits; echoing with the cries of peacocks; furnished
13274,SECTION XIV.,with various species of fowls. And as he was searching for that
13275,SECTION XIV.,"surpassingly beautiful and blameless daughter of the king, that monkey"
13276,SECTION XIV.,awakened the monkeys that were sleeping sweetly. And blown against by
13277,SECTION XIV.,"the wind caused by the wings of the birds as they flew upwards, various"
13278,SECTION XIV.,and variegated trees showered down blossoms. And in the midst of the
13279,SECTION XIV.,"_Asoka_ wood, Hanumln, son unto the Wind-god, covered over with flowers,"
13280,SECTION XIV.,"looked lovely like a hill strewn with blossoms. And all creatures,"
13281,SECTION XIV.,"beholding that monkey embosomed among trees and darting on all sides,"
13282,SECTION XIV.,took him for spring. And strewn with several masses of blossoms loosened
13283,SECTION XIV.,"from the trees, the Earth appeared beauteous like a damsel dight with"
13284,SECTION XIV.,ornaments. And shaken in diverse ways by the motion of the light
13285,SECTION XIV.,"fleeting monkey, the trees showered many-hued flowers. And with their"
13286,SECTION XIV.,"leaves and tops torn, and their flowers and fruits shrivelled up, the"
13287,SECTION XIV.,trees looked like worsted gamblers bereft of their clothes. And shaken
13288,SECTION XIV.,"by Hanumān vehemently moving about, those excellent trees crowned with"
13289,SECTION XIV.,"fruits, speedily cast off fruits, flowers and foliage. And moved by the"
13290,SECTION XIV.,"Wind god’s offspring, the trees with their trunks left, and forsaken by"
13291,SECTION XIV.,the fowls were incapable of harbouring any creatures. And like youthful
13292,SECTION XIV.,"fair ones with hair dishevelled, their paste worn off, their upper lips"
13293,SECTION XIV.,with fair teeth sucked of their moisture; and having their persons torn
13294,SECTION XIV.,with nails and teeth; appeared the _Asoka_ wood with its trees
13295,SECTION XIV.,"shattered; and itself ground with the tail, hands and legs (of Hanumān)."
13296,SECTION XIV.,"And that monkey with his vehemence scattered the clusters of shrubs,"
13297,SECTION XIV.,like the wind violently scattering clouds in the rainy season. And
13298,SECTION XIV.,"ranging there, the monkey saw beautiful pavements, jewelled, silvern aud"
13299,SECTION XIV.,golden. And he saw there various pools filled with excellent water and
13300,SECTION XIV.,having steps crusted with jewels. Their sandy soil was filled with
13301,SECTION XIV.,"pearls and corals, and the ground inside was made of crystal. And their"
13302,SECTION XIV.,banks were decked with diverse golden trees. They were beautified with
13303,SECTION XIV.,"full blown lotuses, water-lilies, _Chakravakas_ and _Natyuhas_³⁰⁶ and"
13304,SECTION XIV.,filled with the notes of swans and _Sārasas_. They were encircled on all
13305,SECTION XIV.,"sides with big tanks having trees on their banks and water, clear and"
13306,SECTION XIV.,"sweet like unto nectar. They were entwined with hundreds of creepers,"
13307,SECTION XIV.,covered with _Santāna_³⁰⁷ flowers and filled with diverse groves and
13308,SECTION XIV.,_Karaviras_ serving the purpose of windows.³⁰⁸ And thereupon that
13309,SECTION XIV.,foremost of monkeys beheld there a mountain—the most picturesque in the
13310,SECTION XIV.,"world, resembling clouds, having high summits, covered on all sides with"
13311,SECTION XIV.,peaks and filled with hilly abodes and various trees. And that monkey
13312,SECTION XIV.,beheld there a river falling down from the mountain like unto a damsel
13313,SECTION XIV.,falling down from the lap of her beloved. And the branches of the trees
13314,SECTION XIV.,touching the water (of the stream) resembled a fair damsel prevented by
13315,SECTION XIV.,her dear companions from forsaking the company of her beloved). And that
13316,SECTION XIV.,great monkey beheld further down the stream turning back like unto the
13317,SECTION XIV.,"damsel, pleased, going back to her dear one. And that foremost of"
13318,SECTION XIV.,"monkeys, Hanumān, the son of Maruti, beheld, at some distance, ponds"
13319,SECTION XIV.,filled with lotuses and various birds. And he saw a big artificial pond
13320,SECTION XIV.,full of cool water having stairs crusted with excellent jewels and its
13321,SECTION XIV.,sandy banks filled with pearls. It was embellished (on all sides) with
13322,SECTION XIV.,"various animals, diverse trees and big mansions made by Viswakarma³⁰⁹"
13323,SECTION XIV.,himself. It was adorned all around with artificial fqrests and all the
13324,SECTION XIV.,"trees there bore flowers and fruits, spreading their branches like unto"
13325,SECTION XIV.,umbrellas and having golden and silvern pavements under them. And that
13326,SECTION XIV.,great monkey beheld there one golden _Singsapa_³¹⁰ tree surrounded on
13327,SECTION XIV.,"all sides with golden pavements. And he saw the glebe, the hill streams"
13328,SECTION XIV.,and many a golden tree resembling fire. By the lustre of all those trees
13329,SECTION XIV.,that heroic monkey appeared as if made of gold like unto the Sun by the
13330,SECTION XIV.,"touch of the mount Sumeru. And having seen those beautiful golden trees,"
13331,SECTION XIV.,shaken by the wind and making a sound like that of a _Kinkini_;³¹¹
13332,SECTION XIV.,having flowery tops and new leaves he was greatly amazed. And climbing
13333,SECTION XIV.,"that _Singsapa_ tree enveloped with leaves that monkey, gifted with"
13334,SECTION XIV.,"velocity, reflected—""Perchance I may see Vaidehi, exercised with grief,"
13335,SECTION XIV.,anxious to behold Rāma and wandering hither and thither at her pleasure.
13336,SECTION XIV.,Certainly this is the picturesque _Asoka_ forest of that vicious-souled
13337,SECTION XIV.,"one, embellished with sandal, _Champakas_ and _Vakulas_. Here is a"
13338,SECTION XIV.,"beautiful pond abounding in lotuses, thronged with birds and forsooth"
13339,SECTION XIV.,shall that royal spouse Jānaki repair hither. She is the beloved queen
13340,SECTION XIV.,"of Rāghava and expert in walking in the garden. And separated from Rāma,"
13341,SECTION XIV.,certainly shall Jānaki repair hither. Or she having the eyes of a young
13342,SECTION XIV.,"antelope and adept in roaming in the forest, exercised with thought"
13343,SECTION XIV.,"touching Rāma, shall come here. Or she having beautiful eyes and fond of"
13344,SECTION XIV.,"ranging in the forest, racked with sorrow in consequence of Rāma’s"
13345,SECTION XIV.,"separation, doth always frequent this forest.³¹² Ere this, the chaste"
13346,SECTION XIV.,"and worshipful spouse of Rāma—Janaka’s daughter, used to love always the"
13347,SECTION XIV.,birds and animals of the forest. (The morning hath set in) and surely
13348,SECTION XIV.,the beautiful and graceful daughter of Janaka fond of performing
13349,SECTION XIV.,"morning³¹³ ablutions, shall come to this river of pure water to perform"

13388,SECTION XV.,"various trees, fragrant with celestial odours and was embellished on all"
13389,SECTION XV.,"sides. It resembled _Nandana_ or the celestial garden, and was filled"

13391,SECTION XV.,notes of _Kokilas_; adorned with the ponds abounding in silvern

13393,SECTION XV.,various houses having spacious courtyards; adorned with beautiful
13394,SECTION XV.,flowers of all seasons and trees bearing fruits. And the beauty of the
13395,SECTION XV.,blossoming _Asokas_ resembled the effulgence of the Sun. And stationed
13396,SECTION XV.,there Māruti beheld trees as if devoid of leaves on account of the
13397,SECTION XV.,"hundreds of birds, adorned with various flowers, resorting there. And he"
13398,SECTION XV.,"saw there the earth touched by _Asoka_ trees, the removers of grief,"
13399,SECTION XV.,having flowers growing from the roots and lowered down with their
13400,SECTION XV.,weight. And the entire quarter was as if ablaze with the beauty of the
13401,SECTION XV.,flowery _Karnikaras_ and _Kingsukas_. And there appeared in beauty many
13402,SECTION XV.,"flowery _Punnagas_, _Saptaparnas_, _Champakas_, and _Udalakas_ having"
13403,SECTION XV.,"deeply expanded roots. And there was a thousand of _Asoka_ trees, some"
13404,SECTION XV.,"of whom were 1ike gold, some were like the flame of fire and some were"
13405,SECTION XV.,like dark-blue collyrium. It was like the garden of _Nandana_ or like
13406,SECTION XV.,that of Kuvera or perhaps it surpassed the both in excellence. And
13407,SECTION XV.,"enveloped in charming, celestial grace beyond conception and having"
13408,SECTION XV.,flowers for stars that forest appeared like a second sky. Aud covered
13409,SECTION XV.,with hundreds of pearl-like flowers the forest looked like the fifth

13411,SECTION XV.,"honey-smelling trees, and filled with diverse notes and various animals"
13412,SECTION XV.,and birds. And that fragrant garden was rendered more charming with
13413,SECTION XV.,various other fragrances. And that foremost of monkeys beheld in that
13414,SECTION XV.,"garden of Asoka, a round palace, situated at a distance, fragrant as the"
13415,SECTION XV.,_Gandhamādana_ mountain and high as the lord of mountains. (The palace)
13416,SECTION XV.,was white as the Kailaça hill and built on a thousand pillars. All its
13417,SECTION XV.,stairs were made of coral and its pavements made of burning gold. Its
13418,SECTION XV.,beauty was as if burning all along and stealing the vision of the
13419,SECTION XV.,lookers-on. It was spotless and on account of its height touched the
13420,SECTION XV.,"welkin. And thereupon he beheld there (Sitā) wearing a soiled cloth,"
13421,SECTION XV.,"poorly, greatly reduced by fast, sighing again and again and encircled"
13422,SECTION XV.,by a band of Rākshasees. She was (however) spotless like unto the rays
13423,SECTION XV.,of the moon on the first lunar day. And her graceful beauty could with
13424,SECTION XV.,great difficulty be perceived like unto the flame of fire enveloped with
13425,SECTION XV.,smoke. And wearing a shattered and soiled yellow cloth and divested of
13426,SECTION XV.,all ornaments she appeared like a lotus stalk without lotuses.³¹⁴
13427,SECTION XV.,"Oppressed, racked with grief, weakened and chaste as she was, she"
13428,SECTION XV.,appeared like Rohini possessed by _Ketu_. She was greatly reduced by
13429,SECTION XV.,"fast, stricken with grief and anxious thoughts, disturbed with sorrow"
13430,SECTION XV.,and was poorly and her eyes were always full of tears. Separated from
13431,SECTION XV.,her kith and kin and not beholding Rāma and Lakshmana³¹⁵ but the
13432,SECTION XV.,"Rākshasees, she appeared like a hind surrounded by dogs. Her braid of"
13433,SECTION XV.,long hair resembling a black serpent falling on her back it appeared as

13436,SECTION XV.,and therefore she was (now) greatly oppressed with sorrow. And beholding
13437,SECTION XV.,"that one of expansive eyes rendered pale and feeble, Hanumān, by various"
13438,SECTION XV.,"conclusive arguments reflected within himself ""She must be Sitā, for"
13439,SECTION XV.,"this damsel looks just like her, whom I saw, when she was ravished by"
13440,SECTION XV.,"Rāvana, assuming shapes at will. Having the countenance of the"
13441,SECTION XV.,"full-moon, beautiful eye brows, round breast, she is as if dispelling"
13442,SECTION XV.,the darkness from all quarters by virtue of her grace. Her throat was
13443,SECTION XV.,"yellow, and her lips were like _Bimbas_.³¹⁶ She was of middle stature"
13444,SECTION XV.,and her limbs were all well built. She had eyes resembling lotus petals
13445,SECTION XV.,and was like the beloved wife of Manmatha—Rati and was adorable unto the
13446,SECTION XV.,whole creation like the rays of the full-moon. That one having a
13447,SECTION XV.,graceful person was seated on the earth like a female ascetic having her
13448,SECTION XV.,senses restrained. And she was sighing again and again like the timid
13449,SECTION XV.,daughter-in-law of the lord of serpents.³¹⁷ Entangled by a mighty web of
13450,SECTION XV.,grief her grace was greatly lessened and she appeared like the flame of
13451,SECTION XV.,fire enveloped in smoke. She was like unto _Smriti_ of doubtful
13452,SECTION XV.,"meanings, fallen wealth, lost respect, hope without any desire for gain,"
13453,SECTION XV.,"_Sidhi_³¹⁸ of many troubles, sullied understanding and fame soiled with"

13455,SECTION XV.,"able to attend upon Rāma, and she having the eyes of a young hind, being"
13456,SECTION XV.,oppressed by the Rākshasees was casting her looks hither and thither.
13457,SECTION XV.,"And with a displeased countenance, having dark-blue and curling eye"
13458,SECTION XV.,"lashes, and eyes full of tears, she was sighing again and again. Worthy"
13459,SECTION XV.,"of wearing ornaments but now without any, poorly, crusted with"
13460,SECTION XV.,"execrations, she appeared like the rays of the stars enveloped by"
13461,SECTION XV.,dark-blue clouds. And beholding Sitā in that pitiable plight like unto
13462,SECTION XV.,"learning for want of practice, (Hanumān) was puzzled with doubts. And"
13463,SECTION XV.,seeing her without ornaments he could with great difficulty make her out
13464,SECTION XV.,like unto words having different meanings without the knowledge of
13465,SECTION XV.,"grammar. And beholding that blameless daughter of the king, having"
13466,SECTION XV.,"expansive eyes, Hanumān, by various reasonings, reflected—""Forsooth she"
13467,SECTION XV.,"must be Sitā. I see at her person all these ornaments, of which Rāma"
13468,SECTION XV.,mentioned unto me at the time of my departure. I behold on her ears
13469,SECTION XV.,excellent ear-rings and nicely placed _Svadangstras_³¹⁹ and on her arms
13470,SECTION XV.,jewelled ornaments rendered dark-blue by dirt for constant use. Verily
13471,SECTION XV.,these are the ornaments Rāma mentioned unto me. I do not perceive them
13472,SECTION XV.,which had been cast off by her. But these are the rest there is not the
13473,SECTION XV.,"least doubt about it. The monkeys had seen, her excellent yellow cloth"
13474,SECTION XV.,"made of golden fibres, on the hill. They had seen also her excellent"
13475,SECTION XV.,"ornaments, which cast off by her, fell on the earth with a sound. Her"
13476,SECTION XV.,cloth hath been shattered by constant use but her grace hath not been
13477,SECTION XV.,rendered worse than its color. This one having a golden countenance must
13478,SECTION XV.,"be the beloved queen of Rāma, who, albeit separated from him, hath not"
13479,SECTION XV.,disappeared from his mind. This is that damsel on whose account Rāma
13480,SECTION XV.,"being simultaneously burnt by affection, pity, grief and"
13481,SECTION XV.,"amour,—affection in consequence of his beloved spouse being ravished,"
13482,SECTION XV.,"pity for his inability to protect one dependent on him, grief for the"
13483,SECTION XV.,loss of his beloved wife and amour for his dear one. Verily it appeareth
13484,SECTION XV.,"from the grace of her person, from her well developed limbs and from"
13485,SECTION XV.,Rāma’s beauty that this worshipful damsel having dark-blue eyes must be
13486,SECTION XV.,"his spouse. She has her mind fixed in him, and he in her and it is for"
13487,SECTION XV.,this that she and the virtuous-souled (Rāma) have been still maintaining
13488,SECTION XV.,their being. Indeed my master Rāma hath performed a mighty task for
13489,SECTION XV.,"breathes he still in her separation, without consuming himself in"
13490,SECTION XV.,"grief."" And having beheld Sitā in this plight, that son of the Wind-god"
13491,SECTION XV.,approached Rāma in mind and showered praises on his master.

13525,SECTION XVI.,family and other auspicious marks they are equal and hence Rāghava
13526,SECTION XVI.,"deserveth Vaidehi and this one of dark-blue eyes is his."" And having"
13527,SECTION XVI.,"seen her, gold-hued and conducing to the happiness of the people like"
13528,SECTION XVI.,"unto the Goddess of wealth, Hanumān approached Rāma in his mind and"
13529,SECTION XVI.,"said:—""For this (damsel) was killed the mighty Vāli and Kavanda—Rāvana’s"
13530,SECTION XVI.,"equal in prowess. (For her too) was destroyed in battle, the terribly"
13531,SECTION XVI.,"powerful Rākshasa—Virādha, by Rāma putting forth his energy, like unto"
13532,SECTION XVI.,_Shambara_ killed by Mahendra. (It was for her) that fourteen thousand
13533,SECTION XVI.,Rākshasas of terrible deeds were destroyed at _Janasthāna_ with arrows
13534,SECTION XVI.,"resembling the flame of fire. And Khara was killed in battle, and"
13535,SECTION XVI.,"Trisharā was discomfitted and the mighty Dushana by Rāma, knowing his"

13538,SECTION XVI.,Vāli. And it is for this (damsel) of expansive eyes that I have crossed
13539,SECTION XVI.,the effulgent lord of rivers and have seen this city. And methinks it
13540,SECTION XVI.,would have been all proper had Rāma turned on her account the whole
13541,SECTION XVI.,earth bounded by oceans. If the kingdom over the three worlds and the
13542,SECTION XVI.,"daughter of Janaka be compared together, the former is not equal to one"
13543,SECTION XVI.,"hundredth part of Sitā. This Sitā, the daughter of the high-souled"
13544,SECTION XVI.,"Janaka, the pious King of Mithilā, firmly attached unto her husband,"
13545,SECTION XVI.,"rose, covered with dust, out of the earth, in a field delved by a"
13546,SECTION XVI.,furrow. She is the well-known eldest daughter-in-law of the king
13547,SECTION XVI.,"Daçaratha, of an adorable character and unchecked prowess. And She is"
13548,SECTION XVI.,"the beloved spouse of the pious and grateful Rāma, knowing his ownself,"
13549,SECTION XVI.,and has been brought under the control of the _Rākshasees_. Renouncing
13550,SECTION XVI.,"all luxuries, and considering not the least about miseries, she actuated"
13551,SECTION XVI.,by her husband’s love entered the solitary forest. And satisfied with
13552,SECTION XVI.,"fruits and roots and ever engaged in her husband’s service, she lived in"
13553,SECTION XVI.,the forest as much delighted as she was in her house. And that one of a
13554,SECTION XVI.,"golden hue, never used to afflictions and who was wont to converse"
13555,SECTION XVI.,"always with a delighted countenance, hath now been suffering"
13556,SECTION XVI.,incomparable miseries. Like unto a thirsty wight longing for an abode
13557,SECTION XVI.,"where he might get a drink, Rāghava panteth after seeing her, gifted"
13558,SECTION XVI.,with an exalted character and oppressed by Rāvana. As a monarch who had
13559,SECTION XVI.,"lost his kingdom, is greatly delighted when he regaineth it, forsooth"
13560,SECTION XVI.,"shall Rāghava, in like manner, be pleased when he shall come by her. She"

13564,SECTION XVI.,"flowers—forsooth she doth not behold, but is engaged with all her heart"
13565,SECTION XVI.,in medidations only touching Rāma. Husband enhanceth the beauty of a

13570,SECTION XVI.,"is greatly pained knowing that she, having dark-blue eyes, resembling"

13572,SECTION XVI.,"patient as the Earth, having eyes resembling lotuses, who was ere this"
13573,SECTION XVI.,"protected by Rāghava and Lakshmana, is now being guarded by Rākshasees"

13576,SECTION XVI.,"water-lily crushed with frost, and hath come by a miserable plight like"
13577,SECTION XVI.,"unto a doe seperated from her mate. The branches of the _Asoka_ trees,"

13593,SECTION XVII.,"sunk in water. While beholding Vaidehi, Hanumān,the son of Maruta,"
13594,SECTION XVII.,"observed at some distance, a number of grim-visaged Rākshasees. Some had"
13595,SECTION XVII.,"one ear, some one eye, some had big ears some were without ears; some"
13596,SECTION XVII.,had formidable ears and some had a nose projecting upwards. And some had
13597,SECTION XVII.,"the upper part of their bodies unusually long and bulky, some had a long"
13598,SECTION XVII.,"and slender neck, some had dishevelled hair, and some one’s person was"
13599,SECTION XVII.,"so thickly covered with hairs, that she appeared to have been cloaked in"
13600,SECTION XVII.,"a blanket. Some had long ears some had a long forehead, some had a long"
13601,SECTION XVII.,"belly, some had long breasts; some had long lips; some had their lips"
13602,SECTION XVII.,"and chins stuck together, some had a long countenance and some had long"
13603,SECTION XVII.,"knees. Some one was of short stature, some were tall, some crooked, some"
13604,SECTION XVII.,"grim-visaged, some dwarfish, some one was of terribly dark colour; some"
13605,SECTION XVII.,had a disfigured countenance; some had coppery eyes and a fearful face.
13606,SECTION XVII.,"Some were terrible-looking, some copper-colored, some black, some angry"

13610,SECTION XVII.,"like that of a buffallo, some like that of a goat, and some like that of"

13612,SECTION XVII.,"elephant, some those of a horse and some had their heads placed on their"
13613,SECTION XVII.,breasts. Some one had only one hand some had only one leg. Some had ears
13614,SECTION XVII.,"like those of a horse, some like those of a cow, some like those of an"
13615,SECTION XVII.,"ass, some like those of an elephant and others had ears like those of a"
13616,SECTION XVII.,"lion. Some had very big noses, some had crooked and others were without"

13618,SECTION XVII.,on their foreheads. Some had their legs like those of elephants some had

13623,SECTION XVII.,"had the face of a goat, some that of an elephant some that of a cow,"
13624,SECTION XVII.,some that of a boar some that of a horse and some that of an ass. Some
13625,SECTION XVII.,"of the Rākshasees were grim-visaged and some hot-natured, quarrelsome"
13626,SECTION XVII.,and had darts and maces in their hands. And some terrible Rākshasees of
13627,SECTION XVII.,"disfigured countenances, had smoky-coloured hairs. And they were all"
13628,SECTION XVII.,"continually drinking wine—always fond of liquor and meat, and all their"
13629,SECTION XVII.,bodies were sprinkled with blood for their living on gore and flesh. And
13630,SECTION XVII.,that foremost of monkeys found all these grim-visaged Rākshasees seated
13631,SECTION XVII.,around that mighty tree enveloped with branches. And the graceful
13632,SECTION XVII.,Hanumān observed at the foot of that tree that worshipful and blameless
13633,SECTION XVII.,"daughter of the king Janaka. She was bereft of all effulgence, racked"
13634,SECTION XVII.,with grief and all her hairs were soiled with dirt. She appeared like a
13635,SECTION XVII.,star fallen down on the earth on the wane of virtue. And famed though
13636,SECTION XVII.,"she was all over the world for her chastity, it was difficult for her"
13637,SECTION XVII.,now to see her husband. She had no excellent ornaments—her attachment
13638,SECTION XVII.,unto her husband was the only ornament. She was imprisoned by the lord
13639,SECTION XVII.,"of Rākshasas and separated from all her friends, she appeared like a"
13640,SECTION XVII.,"she-elephant separated from her band and bound and attacked by a lion,"
13641,SECTION XVII.,and like the rays of the Moon enveloped with clouds at the expiry of the
13642,SECTION XVII.,rainy season. Her beauty was greatly faded (in consequence of her
13643,SECTION XVII.,husband’s separation) like unto a stringed instrument for want of a
13644,SECTION XVII.,player. And ever engaged in her husband’s welfare she was thoroughly
13645,SECTION XVII.,unworthy of being brought under the control of the Rākshasas. Being sunk
13646,SECTION XVII.,in the abyss of grief and encircled by those Rākshasees she appeared in
13647,SECTION XVII.,the forest of Asoka like unto Rohini possessed by Rāhu. And Hanumān
13648,SECTION XVII.,beheld her there like a creeper divested of flowers. And having her
13649,SECTION XVII.,person soiled with dirt and shorn of all ornaments she appeared in her
13650,SECTION XVII.,hidden grace like unto a lotus covered with clay. And the monkey
13651,SECTION XVII.,"Hanumān, beheld that damsel, having the eyes of a young antelope,"
13652,SECTION XVII.,clothed with a soiled and shattered cloth. And though the countenance of
13653,SECTION XVII.,"that worshfpful one was shorn of all grace, her heart did not loose its"
13654,SECTION XVII.,"loftiness in consequence of her husband’s prowess. And Sitā, of"
13655,SECTION XVII.,"dark-blue eyes, was protected by virtue of her own character. And"
13656,SECTION XVII.,"beholding Sitā, having the eyes of a young antelope, and terrified and"
13657,SECTION XVII.,casting her looks hither and thither like a hind and burning down the
13658,SECTION XVII.,trees enveloped with leaves by her breath; like unto a mass of grief and
13659,SECTION XVII.,"an upheaval of sorrow; having well-proportioned limbs, and appearing"
13660,SECTION XVII.,"graceful without ornaments, Māruti attained to an excess of delight. And"
13661,SECTION XVII.,"beholding her having inebriete eyes, Hanumān shed tears of delight and"
13662,SECTION XVII.,bowed unto Rāghava. And having offered his obeisance unto Rāma and
13663,SECTION XVII.,"Lakshmana the powerful Hanumān, greatly delighted in seeing Sitā;"
13664,SECTION XVII.,remained there hidden.

13673,SECTION XVIII.,"hour of the night, he heard the chantings of the Vedas by the Rākshasas,"
13674,SECTION XVIII.,"conversant with the six supplementary parts of the Vedas,³²⁰ engaged in"
13675,SECTION XVIII.,the performance of sacrificial rites and knowing Brahmā. And thereupon
13676,SECTION XVIII.,"the mighty Ten-headed Rākshasa, having huge arms, awoke with the sounds"
13677,SECTION XVIII.,"of those auspicious instruments pleasant unto ears. And awaking, that"
13678,SECTION XVIII.,"great and powerful lord of Rākshasas, having his cloth and garlands"
13679,SECTION XVIII.,"loosened, began to think of Vaidehi. And that Rākshasa, puffed up with"
13680,SECTION XVIII.,"pride, was passionately attached unto her and so he could not restrain"
13681,SECTION XVIII.,"his amour in him. And so adorned with all ornaments, he, casting his"
13682,SECTION XVIII.,looks on the roads containing jewelled and golden gates and appearing in
13683,SECTION XVIII.,"grace, entered the forest of Asoka, filled with various trees containing"
13684,SECTION XVIII.,fruits and flowers of all seasons and with ponds; beautified with
13685,SECTION XVIII.,various flowers; variegated with inebriete and wondrous birds; filled
13686,SECTION XVIII.,with various beautiful wolves; thronged with various deer and covered
13687,SECTION XVIII.,with fruits fallen on the earth. And one hundred damsels followed in the
13688,SECTION XVIII.,train of the son of Pulastya³²¹ like unto the damsels of the celestials
13689,SECTION XVIII.,"and Gandharvas following Mahendra. And among those fair ones, some"
13690,SECTION XVIII.,carried _chowries_ and some fans. And some carrying water in golden jars
13691,SECTION XVIII.,headed the train while others carrying the golden throne covered with a
13692,SECTION XVIII.,coverlet followed it. And a favourite damsel carried in her right hand a
13693,SECTION XVIII.,jewelled drinking bowl filled with wine. And another carrying the white
13694,SECTION XVIII.,"umbrella having golden ribs resembling the full moon and goose, followed"
13695,SECTION XVIII.,"in the train. And in this wise the excellent wives, of Rāvana, having"
13696,SECTION XVIII.,"their eyes rendered sleepy with sleep and wine, followed their heroic"
13697,SECTION XVIII.,husband like unto lightnings following the cloud. Their necklaces and
13698,SECTION XVIII.,"_keyuras_ were displaced, paste faded, hair dishevelled and they had"
13699,SECTION XVIII.,"drops of sweat on their faces. With sleep and intoxication, were reeling"
13700,SECTION XVIII.,"those fair ones of beautiful countenances, having their hairs with"
13701,SECTION XVIII.,garlands disbanded and their persons wet with perspiration. And in this
13702,SECTION XVIII.,"way those beloved wives, (of Rāvana) having inebriete eyes, followed,"
13703,SECTION XVIII.,"out of amour and reverence, their husband. And their mighty husband,"
13704,SECTION XVIII.,brought under the control of amour and having his mind firmly attached
13705,SECTION XVIII.,"unto Sitā, proceeded slowly. And that monkey, son of Māruta, heard the"
13706,SECTION XVIII.,sound of _kanchees_ and _nupuras_ of those excellent damsels. And the
13707,SECTION XVIII.,"monkey Hanumān also beheld Rāvana, of extraordinary deeds and of"
13708,SECTION XVIII.,"inconceivable prowess and strength, at the gate. His whole body was seen"
13709,SECTION XVIII.,on all sides by the light of the lamps lighted with perfumed oil and
13710,SECTION XVIII.,"carried by the Rākshasees before. He was inflamed with amour, pride and"
13711,SECTION XVIII.,haughtiness and his expansive eyes were coppery and idle. And he
13712,SECTION XVIII.,"appeared like Cupid himself just appearing in view, leaving behind his"
13713,SECTION XVIII.,"bow and arrows. And holding his excellent robe, covered with flowers,"
13714,SECTION XVIII.,"washed, set with jewels and white as the foam of the churned nectar, he"
13715,SECTION XVIII.,"placed it in its proper place. And Hanumān, hiding himself on the tree,"
13716,SECTION XVIII.,"in the midst of many leaves and flowers, tried to recognise him as he"
13717,SECTION XVIII.,"approached. And beholding him, that foremost of monkeys saw that highly"
13718,SECTION XVIII.,"famous king Rāvana, surrounded by his excellently beautiful and youthful"
13719,SECTION XVIII.,"wives, enter that forest of enjoyment filled with birds and animals."
13720,SECTION XVIII.,"There was a warder by name Sankukarna in that forest—highly powerful,"
13721,SECTION XVIII.,wearing various ornaments and addicted to drinking. And by him was seen
13722,SECTION XVIII.,that lord of Rākshasas—the son of _Visravasa_. And that highly energetic
13723,SECTION XVIII.,monkey beheld that effulgent (Rāvana) surrounded by excellent damsels
13724,SECTION XVIII.,like unto moon encircled by stars. And beholding him the monkey
13725,SECTION XVIII.,"reflected—""This must be Rāvana—for he is the person whom I saw sleeping"
13726,SECTION XVIII.,"in an excellent apartment in that city."" Thinking this, that highly"
13727,SECTION XVIII.,effulgent son of Māruta—Hanumān leaped (high upon another branch). And
13728,SECTION XVIII.,"effulgent as he was, that highly intelligent monkey hid himself on a"
13729,SECTION XVIII.,"branch covered with leaves, being unable to stand before the effulgence"
13730,SECTION XVIII.,"of that Rākshasa. And Rāvana proceeded in that way, being anxious to"
13731,SECTION XVIII.,"behold the blue-eyed Sitā, having spacious breast, excellent hips and a"

13774,SECTION XIX.,petals crushed by the trunks of elephants. And her grace greatly
13775,SECTION XIX.,famished by the absence of her husband she appeared like a river whose
13776,SECTION XIX.,liquid contents were dried up. And not cleaning her limbs she appeared
13777,SECTION XIX.,"like a dark night. And that one of graceful limbs, tender and worthy of"
13778,SECTION XIX.,"living in a jewelled abode, being stricken with grief, seemod like a"

13781,SECTION XIX.,"band and tied to a pillar, was overwhelmed with grief and was sighing"
13782,SECTION XIX.,"again and again. A long lock of dark-blue hair, taken not the least care"
13783,SECTION XIX.,"of, was on her back; and with this she appeared like unto the earth"
13784,SECTION XIX.,covered with dark-blue forests at the expiration of the rainy season.
13785,SECTION XIX.,"With fasts and grief, anxiety and fear, she was greatly weakened and"

13807,SECTION XX.,is the virtue of the Rākshasas that they always visit others’ wives or
13808,SECTION XX.,"come by them by force. In spite of this, O Maithilee, I do not touch"

13883,SECTION XXI.,"damsel, devoted unto her husband, began to think of him. Placing a twig"
13884,SECTION XXI.,"before, that one, of beautiful smile, said—""Do thou take back thy mind"

13900,SECTION XXI.,"thou, for the destruction of the race of the Rākshasas, considering that"

13902,SECTION XXI.,to naught when they are placed at the hands of a vicious and illiterate
13903,SECTION XXI.,"king. Obtaining thee, (therefore) as her king and for thy folly only,"
13904,SECTION XXI.,"this city of Lankā, abounding in jewels, shall soon be ruined. O Rāvana,"
13905,SECTION XXI.,"every one delighteth in the destruction of that inconsiderate being, who"
13906,SECTION XXI.,bringeth about his own destruction and is engaged in the perpetration of
13907,SECTION XXI.,"evil deeds. And in this way, thyself, the perpetrator of vicious acts,"
13908,SECTION XXI.,"meeting with thy end, those persons who had been tyranized by thee,"
13909,SECTION XXI.,"shall, delightedly, say—""Oh! blessed are we since this terrible"
13910,SECTION XXI.,(Rākshasa) hath met with his end. With wealth or riches thou shalt not
13911,SECTION XXI.,"be able to tempt me. As the rays of the sun belong to him, so I am"
13912,SECTION XXI.,Rāghava’s only. Having laid my head on the beautiful arms of that lord
13913,SECTION XXI.,"of men, how shall I place it again on another’s? Like unto the knowledge"
13914,SECTION XXI.,"of one God monopolized by the Brahmanas only, I am the spouse of that"
13915,SECTION XXI.,"lord of earth only, cognisant of higher truths and marrying me according"
13916,SECTION XXI.,"to the pious ceremonials. May good betide thee, O Rāvana. Do thou take"
13917,SECTION XXI.,"me unto Rāma, stricken with grief as I am, like unto a she-elephant"
13918,SECTION XXI.,anxiously waiting in the forest brought to the lord of elephants. It
13919,SECTION XXI.,"behoveth thee to make friends with Rāma, that best of men, if dost thou"
13920,SECTION XXI.,desire to maintain thy empire and dost not wish to bring about thy own
13921,SECTION XXI.,"destruction. It is known to the world, that Rāma knoweth well the"
13922,SECTION XXI.,sanctions of religion and is kind unto them who seek his shelter. Do
13923,SECTION XXI.,"thou seek his friendship, if dost thou wish to maintain thy life. Do"
13924,SECTION XXI.,thou propitiate him therefore who is kind to his dependents and it
13925,SECTION XXI.,becometh thee to take me respectfully unto him. Thou shalt meet with thy
13926,SECTION XXI.,well-being if dost thou in this wise confer me on that best of Raghus.
13927,SECTION XXI.,"And mighty is the disaster that shall befall thee, if dost thou follow"

13931,SECTION XXI.,"of the twang of Rāma’s bow, like unto the sound of the thunderbolt"
13932,SECTION XXI.,"hurled by Indra. Soon shall arrows, bearing the names of Rāma and"
13933,SECTION XXI.,"Lakshmana and having fiery heads like those of snakes, alight here. And"
13934,SECTION XXI.,covered with _kanka_ leaves they shall undoubtedly cover the whole city
13935,SECTION XXI.,and devastate it by destroying all the Rākshasas. Like unto Garuda
13936,SECTION XXI.,"pulling up the snakes, the Garuda-like Rāma shall pull up thy snake-like"

13939,SECTION XXI.,"with three foot-steps, my husband, the conqueror of foes, shall recover"
13940,SECTION XXI.,"me from thee. Janasthāna hath been devastated, the host of Rākshasas"
13941,SECTION XXI.,"hath been killed, and thou hast been disabled. Truly thou hast"
13942,SECTION XXI.,"perpetrated an impious deed. O Rākshasa, those two lions among men going"

13945,SECTION XXI.,"standing before a tiger, it would have been impossible for thee, to wait"
13946,SECTION XXI.,there in the presence of Rāma and Lakshmana. If dost thou engage in
13947,SECTION XXI.,"conflict with them, thy wealth and friends shall be of no avail unto"
13948,SECTION XXI.,thee (and thou shalt be dis-comfitted) like unto one-handed Asura Vitra

13952,SECTION XXI.,"Kuvera, or whether dost thou, terrified, take refuge unto the assembly"
13953,SECTION XXI.,"of Varuna, thou shalt, for certain, be destroyed by the son of"

13967,SECTION XXII.,is brought under his influence. (But for thee) the more kindly I have
13968,SECTION XXII.,"been behaving towards thee, the more roughly I have been treated. Truly"
13969,SECTION XXII.,doth my love for thee keep in control the wrath like unto a good
13970,SECTION XXII.,"charioteer restraining the swerving stead. O mighty is _amour_ unto men,"
13971,SECTION XXII.,"for on whom this _amour_ falleth, albeit she is an object of wrath,"
13972,SECTION XXII.,"becomes an object of kindness and affection. O thou of fair countenance,"
13973,SECTION XXII.,"it is for this reason, that I do not destroy thee, although thou, who"
13974,SECTION XXII.,"art engaged in false asceticism, art worthy of being killed and"
13975,SECTION XXII.,"dishonored. O Maithilee, for each and every one of all those harsh words"
13976,SECTION XXII.,"which thou hast used by me, dost thou deserve death."" Having spoken thus"
13977,SECTION XXII.,"unto Vaidehi, Rāvana, the lord of Rākhasas, having his wrath subdued,"
13978,SECTION XXII.,"again bespake Sitā: ""I shall wait for those two months, of which I have"
13979,SECTION XXII.,"made a contract, after which thou shalt have to share my bed, O thou of"
13980,SECTION XXII.,a comely presence. And even then if thou dost refuse to regard me as thy
13981,SECTION XXII.,"husband, my cooks shall mince thy limbs with steel and serve thee for my"
13982,SECTION XXII.,"morning meal."" Beholding the lord of Rākshasas remonstrate with the"
13983,SECTION XXII.,"daughter of Janaka in this wise, the daughters of the celestials and"
13984,SECTION XXII.,"Gandharbas became exceedingly sorry. Some with lips, some with eyes, and"
13985,SECTION XXII.,"some with gestures of their faces, they all consoled Sitā, thus"
13986,SECTION XXII.,"distressed by that Rākshasa. And thus consoled by them, and being proud"
13987,SECTION XXII.,"of her good conduct and her husband’s heroism, Sitā thus addressed"
13988,SECTION XXII.,"Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, ""Forsooth there is no person in this city"
13989,SECTION XXII.,who desireth thy welfare and therefore preventeth thee from such an
13990,SECTION XXII.,"impious deed. Who is there in the three worlds, who even dcsireth me in"
13991,SECTION XXII.,"mind, who am the spouse of the virtuous-souled (Rāma) like unto Indra’s"
13992,SECTION XXII.,"Sachee. O thou the vilest of the Rākshasas, for using those vicious"
13993,SECTION XXII.,"words towards the spouse of Rāma, of immeasured prowess, repairing"
13994,SECTION XXII.,whither shalt thou escape vengeance? Like unto an infuriated elephant
13995,SECTION XXII.,"encountering a hare in the forest, thou shalt O Vile! a hare as thou"
13996,SECTION XXII.,"art, meet with that elephant-like Rāma. Thou art not ashamed of railing"
13997,SECTION XXII.,"that lord of Ikshwākus, so long as dost thou not come within his ken. O"
13998,SECTION XXII.,"base! why do not thy grim, terrible, coppery eyes, looking so viciously"
13999,SECTION XXII.,"at me, fall down on earth. O vicious wretch, I am the spouse of that"
14000,SECTION XXII.,virtuous souled (Rāma) and daughter-in-law of Daçaratha—using these vile
14001,SECTION XXII.,"words towards me, why dost not thy tongue fall off? O Ten-necked one, I"
14002,SECTION XXII.,can instantly reduce thee to ashes but for Rāma’s mandate and my ascetic
14003,SECTION XXII.,observances. Thou couldst not have ravished me in the presence of the
14004,SECTION XXII.,highly intelligent Rāma. And undoubtedly for thy destruction this hath
14005,SECTION XXII.,been brought about by God. Thou art heroic and Kuvera’s brother and
14006,SECTION XXII.,"great in prowess, why didst thou then take me by stealth after"
14007,SECTION XXII.,"despatching Rāma away from the hermitage?"" Hearing those words of Sitā,"
14008,SECTION XXII.,"Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas, whirling his grim eyes, looked towards"
14009,SECTION XXII.,the daughter of Janaka. He was like unto a mass of blue clouds and his
14010,SECTION XXII.,arms and necks were long and spacious. He was gifted with elephantine
14011,SECTION XXII.,gaits and his tongues and eyes were sharp and flaming. The top of his
14012,SECTION XXII.,crown was shaking and he had charming garlands around his neck and his
14013,SECTION XXII.,person sprinkled with paste. He had crimson-coloured garlands and
14014,SECTION XXII.,clothes on and his charming arms were adorned with ornaments. Encircled
14015,SECTION XXII.,"with a sword-belt around his waist he appeared like unto Mandara,"
14016,SECTION XXII.,entwined by a snake at the time of the churning of the ocean. With his
14017,SECTION XXII.,"two plump arms, that lord of Rākshasas appeared like unto the hill"
14018,SECTION XXII.,Mandara with its two huge summits. And adorned with a pair of
14019,SECTION XXII.,_Kundalas_³²⁵ resembling the newly risen Sun he looked like a hill
14020,SECTION XXII.,covered with two Asoka trees enveloped with crimson flowers and leaves.
14021,SECTION XXII.,He was like unto _Kalpa_³²⁶ tree and spring incarnate. And albeit
14022,SECTION XXII.,"adorned, he looked terrible like unto a _Caitya_³²⁷ on the"
14023,SECTION XXII.,"cremation-ground. And having his eyes red hot with ire, sighing again"
14024,SECTION XXII.,"and again like unto a snake and casting his looks upon Sitā, Rāvana"
14025,SECTION XXII.,"addressed her again, saying,—""O thou following asceticism, this thy vow"
14026,SECTION XXII.,is without any meaning and beyond the pale of morality. Even shall I
14027,SECTION XXII.,destroy thee to-day like unto the Sun dispelling darkness with his
14028,SECTION XXII.,"rays."" Having thus addressed Maithilee, the inimical king Rāvana cast"
14029,SECTION XXII.,his looks towards the grim-visaged Rākshasees. And among those
14030,SECTION XXII.,"Rākshasees, some had huge ears, some had ears like those of kine, some"
14031,SECTION XXII.,"had ears as long as arms, some had long ears and others were without"
14032,SECTION XXII.,any. And some had legs like those of an elephant; some had like those of
14033,SECTION XXII.,"a cow and some had legs covered with hairs. And some had one eye, some"
14034,SECTION XXII.,"had one leg, some had capacious legs and some were without any. And some"
14035,SECTION XXII.,had huge heads and necks and some had breast and belly beyond
14036,SECTION XXII.,proportions and some had faces and eyes above human size. Some had huge
14037,SECTION XXII.,tongues and nails. And some were without noses. And some had leonine
14038,SECTION XXII.,"faces, some had faces like those of kine and some had those of boars."
14039,SECTION XXII.,"And casting his look towards such Rākshasees, he said—""Ye Rākshasees, do"
14040,SECTION XXII.,"ye all endeavour to bring Sitā, the daughter of Janaka, under my"
14041,SECTION XXII.,"control. By good or bad conduct, by conciliation or gift, by threat or"
14042,SECTION XXII.,"blandishment, do ye so endeavour as Vaidehi’s soul might be bent unto"
14043,SECTION XXII.,"me."" And having ordered thus again and again, that lord of Rākshasas,"
14044,SECTION XXII.,"stricken with amour and ire, addressed Sitā, roaring fiercely. And"
14045,SECTION XXII.,"thereupon approaching speedily and embracing the Ten-necked one, one"
14046,SECTION XXII.,"Rākshasee named Dhānyamalini bespake him:—""Do thou sport with me, O"
14047,SECTION XXII.,great king. What shalt thou do with her?—O lord of Rākshasas—a human
14048,SECTION XXII.,"being,poorly and of a pale countenance. O great king, forsooth, the"
14049,SECTION XXII.,celestials have not destined for her enjoyment all those objects which
14050,SECTION XXII.,thou hast procured by thy prowess. And again he who desireth for an
14051,SECTION XXII.,unwilling dame burneth his own person—and he who desireth for a willing
14052,SECTION XXII.,"damsel, attaineth excess of delight."" Having said this, the Rākshasee"
14053,SECTION XXII.,"took away Rāvana by force. And that Rākshasa too, resembling a mass of"
14054,SECTION XXII.,"clouds, laughing, turned back. And that Ten-necked one, strode away as"

14074,SECTION XXIII.,Having spoken thus unto Maithilee and commanded the host of the
14075,SECTION XXIII.,"Rākshasees, Rāvana, a terror unto his enemies, went away. And after that"
14076,SECTION XXIII.,"lord of Rākshasas had gone away and entered his inner apartment, the"
14077,SECTION XXIII.,hideous Rākshasees drew near Sitā. And approaching Sitā that terrible
14078,SECTION XXIII.,"host, almost faint with ire, addressed Vaidehi with the following harsh"
14079,SECTION XXIII.,"words—""Thou dost not regard it highly, Sitā, that thou shalt become the"
14080,SECTION XXIII.,"chosen wife of that high-souled, and great Rāvana, the Ten-necked son of"
14081,SECTION XXIII.,"Pulastya."" Thereupon another Rākshasee name4 Ekjatā, with eyes rendered"
14082,SECTION XXIII.,"coppery with ire, addressing Sitā, having a small navel, said,—""Pulastya"
14083,SECTION XXIII.,"is the fourth of the six Prajāpatis,³²⁸ a mind-born son of Brahmā and"
14084,SECTION XXIII.,"celebrated in the world. And the glorious ascetic, by name Bishravā. was"
14085,SECTION XXIII.,"the mind-born son unto Pulastya, effulgent like unto Prajāpatis. O"
14086,SECTION XXIII.,large-eyed damsel! Of Visravā came Rāvana terrible unto his enemies. And
14087,SECTION XXIII.,it behoveth thee to become the consort of that lord of Rākshasas. Scorn
14088,SECTION XXIII.,"not the words I say unto thee, O thou of comely presence."" Thereupon"
14089,SECTION XXIII.,"another Rākshasee named Harijatā, having the eyes of a cat, and whirling"
14090,SECTION XXIII.,"them with ire, said—""It becometh thee to be the wife of that lord of"
14091,SECTION XXIII.,Rākshasas who smote the thirty three celestials and their lord in
14092,SECTION XXIII.,"battle. Dost thou not desire to be his wife, who is heroic, of"

14094,SECTION XXIII.,"away in scorn from his beloved wife, highly esteemed, the mighty king"
14095,SECTION XXIII.,"Rāvana, desireth for thee. And leaving his inner apartment enriched with"
14096,SECTION XXIII.,"thousand of females and adorned with various jewels, Rāvana shall adore"

14098,SECTION XXIII.,by his terrible prowess subdued the Gandharbas³²⁹ and Nāgas³³⁰ in
14099,SECTION XXIII.,"battle, hath stood by thee. O foolish damsel, why dost thou not wish to"

14125,SECTION XXIV.,"O Sitā, to live in his inner apartment, liked by all and abounding in"
14126,SECTION XXIV.,"costly bedsteads. O woman, thou regardest highly to be the wife of a"

14128,SECTION XXIV.,"thou spend happily thy days with our lord—Rāvana, the Rākshasa chief,"
14129,SECTION XXIV.,"who makes his own the treasures of the three worlds. Thou art a woman, O"

14131,SECTION XXIV.,"thou of a blameless countenance, who is a man, deprived of his kingdom,"
14132,SECTION XXIV.,"overwhelmed with disasters and hath his desires frustrated."" Hearing the"
14133,SECTION XXIV.,"words of those Rākshasees, the lotus-eyed Sitā, with her eyes full of"
14134,SECTION XXIV.,"tears said.—""What ye have all said and which is against human usage and"
14135,SECTION XXIV.,"vicious, doth not find place in my mind. A woman cannot be the wife of a"
14136,SECTION XXIV.,"Rākshasa. Eat me up if you will, I will never follow your words. Poor or"
14137,SECTION XXIV.,"deprived of kingdom, he who is my hunband, is my preceptor. I am ever"
14138,SECTION XXIV.,"devoted unto him, like Subarchalā³³¹ unto the Sun. Like unto the great"

14145,SECTION XXIV.,"by Rāvana, almost beside themselves with ire, again covered her with"
14146,SECTION XXIV.,reproaches rough and rude. And Hanumān remained all along speechless and
14147,SECTION XXIV.,hidden on the _Shingshapa_ tree. And that monkey heard all those demons
14148,SECTION XXIV.,"remonstrate with Sitā in this way. And those, influenced with ire,"
14149,SECTION XXIV.,"approached the trembling Sitā and encircling her, licked again and again"
14150,SECTION XXIV.,"their long and burning lips. And taking up instantly spears, they"
14151,SECTION XXIV.,"exceedingly wroth, menaced her, saying—""She is not worthy of having"
14152,SECTION XXIV.,"Rāvana, the lord of the Rākshasas, as her lord."" Being thus remonstrated"
14153,SECTION XXIV.,"with by those terrible Rākshasees, that excellent damsel, shedding"
14154,SECTION XXIV.,"tears, neared the _Singshapa_ tree. And the large-eyed Sitā, encircled"
14155,SECTION XXIV.,"by the Rākshasees, remained there sunk in grief. And all those hideous"
14156,SECTION XXIV.,"demons, showered reproaches, from all sides, on her, greatly reduced, of"
14157,SECTION XXIV.,"a poorly countenance, and wearing a soiled cloth. Thereupon a"
14158,SECTION XXIV.,"grim-visaged demon, angry, having hideous teeth and a huge belly"
14159,SECTION XXIV.,"extending downwards, by name Vinatā, spake, saying:—""O Sitā, thou hast"
14160,SECTION XXIV.,"shown enough of attachment towards thy husband. But, O gentle dame,"
14161,SECTION XXIV.,excess of any thing tends to evil. We are satisfied. And may good betide
14162,SECTION XXIV.,"thee! Thou hast acted worthily like a woman. Do thou hear, O Maithilee,"
14163,SECTION XXIV.,"what I say for thy welfare. Do thou accept, Rāvana, the lord of the"
14164,SECTION XXIV.,"Rākshasa host, as thy husband. He withstands powerfully his enemies like"
14165,SECTION XXIV.,"unto Vāsava, the lord of the celestials, charitable, kind unto all, and"
14166,SECTION XXIV.,"sweet-speeched. And forsaking Rāma, a poor wight, do thou take Rāvana"
14167,SECTION XXIV.,(as thy husband). Having thy person sprinkled with celestial paste and
14168,SECTION XXIV.,"adorned with excellent ornaments, do thou from to-day O Vaidchi, O thou"
14169,SECTION XXIV.,"of comely presence, become the queen of all the worlds, like unto Sachee"

14172,SECTION XXIV.,say and if dost thou not follow it we shall all instantly banquet on
14173,SECTION XXIV.,"thee."" And thereupon another Rākshasee named Vikatā, having her breast"
14174,SECTION XXIV.,"hanging long, exercised with ire, and clinching her fist, addressed,"
14175,SECTION XXIV.,"roaring, Sitā—""O foolish daughter of the king of Mithilā, we have put up"
14176,SECTION XXIV.,"with all thy foolish words only out of compassion, and because thou art"
14177,SECTION XXIV.,a feeble being. It will not lead to thy well-being if thou dost not hear
14178,SECTION XXIV.,"our words. Thou hast been brought here, the other side of the ocean,"
14179,SECTION XXIV.,difficult of being approached by others. Thou hast come within the
14180,SECTION XXIV.,"terrible abode of Rāvana O Maithilee, and hast been shut up in his room"
14181,SECTION XXIV.,"guarded by us all. And even, Purandara’s³³³ self cannot save you. Do"
14182,SECTION XXIV.,"thou therefore hear, O Maithilee, my well-meaning words. Why dost thou"
14183,SECTION XXIV.,shed tears? Renounce thy useless grief. Do thou become happy and
14184,SECTION XXIV.,"delighted, renouncing thy continued melancholy. Do thou sport, O Sitā,"
14185,SECTION XXIV.,"at thy pleasure, with the lord of the Rākshasas. We know, for certain, O"
14186,SECTION XXIV.,"timid damsel, that the youth of the females, is very transient. And so"
14187,SECTION XXIV.,"long as thy youth doth not fade, do thou pass thy days happily, O thou"
14188,SECTION XXIV.,"having inebrite eyes, with the lord of Rākshasas, in picturesque"
14189,SECTION XXIV.,"gardens, and mountain forests. Do thou take, O fair damsel, Rāvana, the"
14190,SECTION XXIV.,"lord of the Rākshasas, for thy husband, and thousands of females shall"
14191,SECTION XXIV.,"be placed at thy service. If dost thou not follow, what I say, O"
14192,SECTION XXIV.,"Maithilee, I shall taking out thy heart, banquet on it."" Thereupon"
14193,SECTION XXIV.,"another grim-visaged Rākshasee, named, Chandodorā, shaking her terrible"
14194,SECTION XXIV.,"spear, said—""Beholding this Sitā having the eyes of a young antelope and"
14195,SECTION XXIV.,"her breast trembling with fear, my earnest desire, as I am _enciente_,"
14196,SECTION XXIV.,"hath been to banquet on her large eyes, lever, spleen, her plump hands,"
14197,SECTION XXIV.,"heart, other limbs and head."" Thereupon another Rākshasee named Praghasā"
14198,SECTION XXIV.,"said—""I shall grind the throat of this cruel woman. What are you doing,"
14199,SECTION XXIV.,sitting there? Ye shall then relate unto the king that the woman is
14200,SECTION XXIV.,"dead. And undoubtedly he shall say ’Do ye eat her up.’"" And thereupon"
14201,SECTION XXIV.,"another Rākshasee named Ajāmukhee said ""I do not like quarrels. Let us"
14202,SECTION XXIV.,all divide her into equal portions. Bring soon our favourite drink and
14203,SECTION XXIV.,"various garlands."" Then followed another Rākshasee by name"
14204,SECTION XXIV.,"Surpanakhā,—""I do fully concur with what Ajāmukhee hath said. Bring soon"
14205,SECTION XXIV.,"wine, the remover of all griefs. Banquetting on human flesh I shall"
14206,SECTION XXIV.,"dance before the queen Nikumbhilā."" Being thus threatened by those"
14207,SECTION XXIV.,"grim-visaged Rākshasees Sitā, resembling the daughter of a celestial,"
14208,SECTION XXIV.,"renouncing patience, began to weep."

14223,SECTION XXV.,And those hideous Rākshasees thus threatning her with reproaches rude
14224,SECTION XXV.,"and rough, the daughter of the king Janaka began to weep. And being thus"
14225,SECTION XXV.,"addressed by those Rākshasees, Vaidehi, of subdued soul, being greatly"
14226,SECTION XXV.,"terrified, said, having her voice choked with vapour,—""A woman can never"
14227,SECTION XXV.,"be the wife of a Rākshasa. Eat me up if you will, I shall never follow"
14228,SECTION XXV.,"your words."" And being surrounded by the Rākshasees and threatened by"
14229,SECTION XXV.,"Rāvana, Sitā, resembling the daughter of a celestial, stricken with"
14230,SECTION XXV.,"grief, could not console herself. And trembling, she shrank from their"
14231,SECTION XXV.,presence like unto a strayed fawn surrounded by wolves. And resorting to
14232,SECTION XXV.,"a flowery branch of an _Asoka_ tree, she sunk in grief, thought upon her"
14233,SECTION XXV.,"lord. With tears she bathed her beautiful breast and oppressed with woe,"
14234,SECTION XXV.,she could not reach the other bank of the ocean of grief. Like a
14235,SECTION XXV.,"plantain tree shaken by the breeze, she shook and fell down trembling"
14236,SECTION XXV.,"(on the earth). And being afraid of the Rākshasees, her cheeks forsook"
14237,SECTION XXV.,"their native hue. And herself trembling, her pretty long lock of hair"
14238,SECTION XXV.,also shook and appeared like a serpent moving this way and that.
14239,SECTION XXV.,"Overwhelmed with grief and beside herself with ire, the daughter of the"
14240,SECTION XXV.,"king of Mithilā, wept and exclaimed sorrowfully,—""O mother Kausalyā! O"
14241,SECTION XXV.,queen Sumitra! true is the saying of the wise that death doth never
14242,SECTION XXV.,approach untimely the male or the female. Or else I would not have lived
14243,SECTION XXV.,"for a moment, separated from Rāma and oppressed by the Rākshasees as I"
14244,SECTION XXV.,"am. Limited is my virtue, and therefore I am to die the death of a poor"
14245,SECTION XXV.,deserted thing like unto a bark driven by the blast in the midst of the
14246,SECTION XXV.,ocean. Debarred from my husband’s sight and tortured by the hideous
14247,SECTION XXV.,"demons, I shall sink, oppressed with woes, like unto the banks of a"
14248,SECTION XXV.,"river, washed by the water. Oh blest are they who have been resting"
14249,SECTION XXV.,"their eyes upon my grateful and sweet-speeched lord of leonine gaits,"
14250,SECTION XXV.,having eyes resembling lotus petals! And separated frpm Rāma of subdued
14251,SECTION XXV.,"soul, it is as difficult for me to breathe as for him who hath drank up"
14252,SECTION XXV.,virulent poison. What mighty iniquity had I perpetrated in my previous
14253,SECTION XXV.,existence that I have met with this terrible disaster! I wish to
14254,SECTION XXV.,renounce my life under this load of grief—but alas! I am surrounded by
14255,SECTION XXV.,the Rākshasees and cannot meet Rāma. Oh! cursed is this subject human

14259,SECTION XXV.,
14260,SECTION XXVI.,SECTION XXVI.
14261,SECTION XXVI.,
14262,SECTION XXVI.,
14263,SECTION XXVI.,"Saying this, the daughter of the king Janaka, bathed her countenance"
14264,SECTION XXVI.,with tears and hanging down her head began to lament. And she began to
14265,SECTION XXVI.,"roll on the earth like unto a colt as if she was mad, possessed by a"
14266,SECTION XXVI.,"devil and had lost her sense. ""I, the spouse of Rāma, who was drawn away"
14267,SECTION XXVI.,"at a distance by the Rākshasa (Māricha) assuming shapes at will, was"
14268,SECTION XXVI.,"seized and borne away by Rāvana. A captive of the Rākshasas, subject to"
14269,SECTION XXVI.,"their terrible threats and taunts, sunk in grief and anxiety,—I desire"
14270,SECTION XXVI.,"not to keep my life. Of what avail are wealth, ornament and life unto"
14271,SECTION XXVI.,"me, who am living in the midst of the Rākshasas and separated from Rāma,"
14272,SECTION XXVI.,"of the mighty car? Forsooth my life is made of stone, imperishable and"

14274,SECTION XXVI.,"me! who am unchaste and vile and my life is vicious, since breathe I"
14275,SECTION XXVI.,still in the absence of my lord. What of fixing my fancy on that
14276,SECTION XXVI.,"night-ranger, my meaner foot even shall not touch him? That (demon) who"
14277,SECTION XXVI.,"is courting me in this terrible way, doth not know himself, his own race"
14278,SECTION XXVI.,"and that I loathe him so much. What more shall I speak unto you, I shall"
14279,SECTION XXVI.,"never consent to Rāvana’s prayer, I might be rent from limb to limb or"
14280,SECTION XXVI.,"burnt in fire. Rāghava is grateful, true, wise and kind. I fear it is"
14281,SECTION XXVI.,through my ill-luck that he doth not feel pity for me. Will he not take
14282,SECTION XXVI.,me back who alone slew the thousands of the Rashasas in Janasthāna? I
14283,SECTION XXVI.,"have been captured by Rāvana, a Rākshasa of feeble prowess. Forsooth my"
14284,SECTION XXVI.,lord is capable of slaying this Rāvana in conflict. Will not that Rāma
14285,SECTION XXVI.,"regain me, by whom was killed in the forest of Dandaka, Virādha, the"
14286,SECTION XXVI.,foremost of the Rākshasa crew? Although situated in the midst of the
14287,SECTION XXVI.,"ocean, Lankā is unapproachable by others, but Rāghava’s arrows shall"
14288,SECTION XXVI.,"also reach here. (I am at a loss to ascertain) why Rāma of firm prowess,"
14289,SECTION XXVI.,"doth not regain me, his beloved spouse who have been borne away by the"
14290,SECTION XXVI.,"Rākshasa. Methinks Rāma doth not know that I am here, or else, powerful"
14291,SECTION XXVI.,"as he is, he would not have put up with this insult. That lord of"
14292,SECTION XXVI.,"vultures, who could have informed Rāghava, of my being borne away by the"
14293,SECTION XXVI.,"Rākshasa, was killed by Rāvana in the battle. O great was the work done"
14294,SECTION XXVI.,"by him, who, old as he was, for my sake, addressed himself to bring"
14295,SECTION XXVI.,"about Rāvana’s destruction. If Rāghava could know that I was here, he,"
14296,SECTION XXVI.,"exceedingly wroth, would have cleared the earth with his arrows, of the"
14297,SECTION XXVI.,"Rākshasas. He would have then burnt down the city of Lankā, dried up the"
14298,SECTION XXVI.,deep and blotted out the name and fame of Rāvana. And from each ruined
14299,SECTION XXVI.,home would have risen the Rākshasa widows’ groans and cries like unto
14300,SECTION XXVI.,"those of mine. And instituting enquiries, along with Lakshmana, he shall"
14301,SECTION XXVI.,soon reduce Lankā to this plight. And observed by them the enemy shall
14302,SECTION XXVI.,"not live for a moment. And in no time, shall Lankā, assume the"
14303,SECTION XXVI.,"appearance of a cremation ground, having all her high ways enveloped"
14304,SECTION XXVI.,"with smoke issuing out of the funeral pyres, and filled with vultures."
14305,SECTION XXVI.,And soon shall this desire of mine be fulfilled. All these words of mine
14306,SECTION XXVI.,do sound improbable now but they all indicate your misfortune. Besides
14307,SECTION XXVI.,"from these bad omens, that are to be seen here, it appeareth, that Lankā"
14308,SECTION XXVI.,"shall soon be shorn of her grace. The lord of the Rākshasas, the vicious"
14309,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāvana being killed, forsooth shall Lankā, divested of wealth, appear"
14310,SECTION XXVI.,"like a widow. This Lankā, which is now full of pious ceremonies, shall,"
14311,SECTION XXVI.,"on the death of the Rākshasas and their master, appear like a"
14312,SECTION XXVI.,"husbandless woman. For certain, shall I soon hear the cries and groans"
14313,SECTION XXVI.,"in every house, of the daughters of the Rākshasas worn with grief. If"
14314,SECTION XXVI.,"that heroic Rāma, having dark-blue eyes, comes to know that I am in the"
14315,SECTION XXVI.,"abode of the Rākshasas, the city of Lankā shall be burnt down with his"
14316,SECTION XXVI.,arrows and shall be stricken with darkness and shorn of grace and all
14317,SECTION XXVI.,the foremost of the Rākshasas shall be destroyed. The time which was
14318,SECTION XXVI.,"appointed by the vile and cruel Rāvana, hath arrived. And that vicious"
14319,SECTION XXVI.,wretch hath resolved to destroy me now. There is no crime which cannot
14320,SECTION XXVI.,be perpetrated by those vicious demons. Mighty is the disaster that
14321,SECTION XXVI.,shall arise on account of this crime—the Rākshasas who live on flesh do
14322,SECTION XXVI.,not know what virtue is. Forsooth shall the Rākshasa serve me for his
14323,SECTION XXVI.,morning meal. What shall I do without my lord of comely presence?
14324,SECTION XXVI.,"Debarred from my husband’s presence, stricken with grief and not"
14325,SECTION XXVI.,"beholding Rāma, having dark-blue eyes, I shall soon meet with death."
14326,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāma, the elder brother of Bharata, doth not know that I am still alive"
14327,SECTION XXVI.,or else he and Lakshmana would have ransacked the whole world for me. Or
14328,SECTION XXVI.,"renouncing his body on this earth for my grief, the heroic elder brother"
14329,SECTION XXVI.,"of Lakshmana, hath repaired to the celestial region. Blessed are the"
14330,SECTION XXVI.,"celestials, Gandharbas, Siddhas and mighty ascetics who are beholding my"
14331,SECTION XXVI.,heroic lotus-eyed Rāma. Or that highly intelligent royal ascetic
14332,SECTION XXVI.,"deairous of securing piety and freed from the troubles of life, hath no"
14333,SECTION XXVI.,need of a wife like me. Or people have fancy for what they see and which
14334,SECTION XXVI.,disappeateth as soon as the object is out of sight. The ungrateful are
14335,SECTION XXVI.,"capable of renouncing their love, but not Rāma. Or there might be some"
14336,SECTION XXVI.,folly in me. Or on the wane of my good luck have been separated irom the
14337,SECTION XXVI.,excellent Rāma. Death is more preferable unto me than life since I have
14338,SECTION XXVI.,"been separated trom the high-souled heroic Rāma, of unblemished"
14339,SECTION XXVI.,"character and the slayer of foes. Or those two brothers, the foremost of"
14340,SECTION XXVI.,"men, laying aside their weapons, and living on fruits and roots, have"
14341,SECTION XXVI.,been wandering in the forest. Or those two heroic brothers Rāma and
14342,SECTION XXVI.,"Lakshmana, have been, by treachery, put to death, by the vicious-souled"
14343,SECTION XXVI.,"Rāvana, the lord of Rākshasas. At this time of distress, I do with all"
14344,SECTION XXVI.,"my heart long lor death,—(but alas!) even death is not approaching me in"
14345,SECTION XXVI.,"this my misery. Oh blessed are those high-souled, great ascetics abiding"
14346,SECTION XXVI.,"by truth and having their senses in control, who have no objects of love"

14358,SECTION XXVII.,"Being thus addressed angrily by Sitā, some of those Rākshasees, beside"
14359,SECTION XXVII.,"themselves with ire, proceeded to relate this unto the vicious-souled"
14360,SECTION XXVII.,Rāvana. And approaching Sitā those grim-visaged demons again addressed
14361,SECTION XXVII.,"her with words rude and rough. ""O vile Sitā, O thou bent on committing"
14362,SECTION XXVII.,"sin, we Rākshasees shall to-day devour thy flesh to the best of our"
14363,SECTION XXVII.,"satisfaction."" Beholding those vile demons threaten Sitā, a Rākshasa"
14364,SECTION XXVII.,"matron, wise and old, named, Trijatā cried—""O vile demons, do ye eat"
14365,SECTION XXVII.,"your own persons³³⁴ but do not devour Sitā, the daughter of Janaka and"
14366,SECTION XXVII.,the esteemed daughter-in-law of the king Daçaratha. I dreamt a terrible
14367,SECTION XXVII.,dream last night which made my down stand on their end. And in that
14368,SECTION XXVII.,dream I foresaw the overthrow of the Rākshasa race and the conquest of
14369,SECTION XXVII.,"her husband."" And being thus addressed by Trijatā, those demons,"
14370,SECTION XXVII.,"exercised with wrath and terrified, accosted her with the following"
14371,SECTION XXVII.,"words,—""Do thou relate (unto us) what sort of dream didst thou dream"
14372,SECTION XXVII.,"last night."" And hearing those words proceeding from the mouths of the"
14373,SECTION XXVII.,"Rākshasees, Trijatā began to describe the dream she had at the latter"
14374,SECTION XXVII.,"end of the night,—""I saw Rāma, wearing garlands and clothed in white,"
14375,SECTION XXVII.,"ride in a celestial charriot, along with Lakshmana, made of ivory,"
14376,SECTION XXVII.,traversing the etherial regions and drawn by a hundred steeds. I saw in
14377,SECTION XXVII.,"my dream to-night, that Sitā, clad in the purest white, appearing on a"
14378,SECTION XXVII.,"snow-white hill beaten by the waves of the ocean, had at last met Rāma,"
14379,SECTION XXVII.,like unto light joined to the Sun. And I again saw Rāma and Lakshmana
14380,SECTION XXVII.,"appear in effulgence, seated on a huge elephant, having four tusks and"
14381,SECTION XXVII.,"resembling a bull. Thereupon those two (brothers), resplendant like unto"
14382,SECTION XXVII.,"the Sun by their own effulgence, and wearing white garlands and clothes,"
14383,SECTION XXVII.,"appeared near Janaka’s daughter. And the lotus eyed Jānaki, on the top"
14384,SECTION XXVII.,"of the hill situate on the welkin, first fell on the lap of her husband"
14385,SECTION XXVII.,and then stationed herself on the neck of the elephant guided by her
14386,SECTION XXVII.,husband. Then I saw Sitā rubbing the Sun and the Moon with her two
14387,SECTION XXVII.,"hands. And then that best of the elephants, with those two princes and"
14388,SECTION XXVII.,"the large eyed Sitā on him, stood high above Lankā. I again saw Rāma,"
14389,SECTION XXVII.,"clad in white, and adorned with garlands, ride along with Lakshmana in a"
14390,SECTION XXVII.,charriot drawn by eight white bullocks. I again saw that highly
14391,SECTION XXVII.,"energetic, best of men—Rāma, having truth for his prowess, along with"
14392,SECTION XXVII.,"his brother Lakshmana and Sitā flee to Northern realms, ascending a"
14393,SECTION XXVII.,celestial flowery charriot resembling (in brightness) the Sun. And I saw
14394,SECTION XXVII.,"Rāvana too, shaved and shorn, besmeared with oil, wearing a crimson"
14395,SECTION XXVII.,"cloth, drinking honey, wearing a garland of Karavira flowers, fall down"
14396,SECTION XXVII.,"on earth from the flowery charriot. And dragged by a woman, shaved,"
14397,SECTION XXVII.,"wearing a red cloth and garlands and sprinkled with crimson paste,"
14398,SECTION XXVII.,Rāvana was again seen by me riding in a charriot drawn by asses. And
14399,SECTION XXVII.,"quaffing oil, laughing and dancing, that one of agitated senses,"
14400,SECTION XXVII.,forgetting himself sped on the charriot to the South.³³⁵ And I again saw
14401,SECTION XXVII.,"Rāvana, the lord of the Rākshasas, stricken with fear, fall, headless,"
14402,SECTION XXVII.,"down on the earth. And then rising all on a sudden, and uttering obscene"
14403,SECTION XXVII.,"and inconsistent words like unto a maniac, Rāvana overwhelmed with fear,"
14404,SECTION XXVII.,"and amazement, and intoxicated, fell into a mass of dirt, stinking and"
14405,SECTION XXVII.,resembling the very hell. And again proceeding to the South he entered
14406,SECTION XXVII.,"into a lake devoid of mud and water. And a dark woman, clad in a crimson"
14407,SECTION XXVII.,"cloth, and bedaubed with mud, dragged the Ten-necked demon, entwining"
14408,SECTION XXVII.,herself round his neck. Then followed the mighty Kumvakarna³³⁶ and all
14409,SECTION XXVII.,"the sons of Rāvana, shaved and shorn and besmeared with oil. And they"
14410,SECTION XXVII.,"all proceeded southward—the Ten-necked demon on on a boar, Indrajit³³⁷"
14411,SECTION XXVII.,"on a porpoise, and Kumvakarna on a camel. I saw only Biveesana, with a"
14412,SECTION XXVII.,"white umbrella and accompanied by four courtiers, range in the welkin."
14413,SECTION XXVII.,And there was audible in the large assembly sound of music and stringed
14414,SECTION XXVII.,"instruments. And all the Rākshasas wearing crimson clothes and garlands,"
14415,SECTION XXVII.,were quaffing oil. I saw the royal and picturesque city Lankā with her
14416,SECTION XXVII.,"steeds, cars and elephants, drowned in the ocean, having her gateways"
14417,SECTION XXVII.,"and ornamented arches broken. And in Lankā, covered with dust, Rākshasa"
14418,SECTION XXVII.,"women, laughing; and making terrible sound, were engaged in quaffing"
14419,SECTION XXVII.,"oil. I saw all the leading Rākshasas—Kumvakarna and others, dark-hued"
14420,SECTION XXVII.,"and wearing crimson clothes, emerged in an abyss of cow dung. Do ye"
14421,SECTION XXVII.,"therefore fly at some distance, and will find that Rāghava shall regain"
14422,SECTION XXVII.,Sitā. And exercised with ire he shall destroy you all along with the
14423,SECTION XXVII.,"Rākshasas. Rāghava shall never brook, his esteemed and beloved spouse,"
14424,SECTION XXVII.,"living in the forest, being taunted and threatened by you. No more with"
14425,SECTION XXVII.,rough words therefore; do you console the lady and humbly pray her to
14426,SECTION XXVII.,"forgive you. This I think proper. Surely shall she, divested of"
14427,SECTION XXVII.,"misfortune, be reconciled to her beloved and excellent husband,"
14428,SECTION XXVII.,"regarding whom, in her misery, I have dreamt such a dream. Ye"
14429,SECTION XXVII.,"Rākshasees! You have threatened her, do ye implore her forgiveness—no"
14430,SECTION XXVII.,"more with harsh words. Forsooth, from Rāghava shall proceed the mighty"
14431,SECTION XXVII.,"disaster of the Rākshasas. If Maithilee, the daughter of the king"
14432,SECTION XXVII.,"Janaka, be pleased with you (for your imploring her forgiveness) you"
14433,SECTION XXVII.,might be saved from the mighty disaster. I do not perceive any
14434,SECTION XXVII.,inauspicious mark on the person of this large-eyed dame. It appears from
14435,SECTION XXVII.,the paleness of her countenance that she hath been overcome by
14436,SECTION XXVII.,"misfortune. And I saw (in my dreamt this worshipful damsel, unworthy of"
14437,SECTION XXVII.,"any misfortune, stationed in the welkin. Verily I do perceive, before"
14438,SECTION XXVII.,"me, the satisfaction of Vaidehi’s end, the destruction of the lord of"
14439,SECTION XXVII.,"the Rākshasas and the conquest of Rāghava. Behold I there, her left eye,"
14440,SECTION XXVII.,"spacious, as a lotus-petal, is dancing to hear this pleasant dream"
14441,SECTION XXVII.,announcing the satisfaction of her own end. And her left arm is also
14442,SECTION XXVII.,"dancing with joy, all on a sudden. And her excellent beautiful left"
14443,SECTION XXVII.,"thigh, resembling the trunk of an elephant, is also dancing as if"
14444,SECTION XXVII.,"indicating, that she shall at no distant date, be reconciled to Rāghava."
14445,SECTION XXVII.,"And the birds, again and again, entering their nests, and highly"
14446,SECTION XXVII.,delighted are pouring forth their notes announcing the advent of a happy

14665,SECTION XXXI.,"noble and pious king named Daçaratha, highly glorious amongst the"
14666,SECTION XXXI.,"Ikshawkus, the lord of the warrior-cars, steeds and elephants. Devoid of"

14669,SECTION XXXI.,marks; highly beautiful; the foremost of the kings; famous all over the
14670,SECTION XXXI.,world of many oceans; the conferrer of happiness and himself happy. His
14671,SECTION XXXI.,"eldest and most beloved son was the Moon-bright Rāma, wise and the"
14672,SECTION XXXI.,foremost of those who know the science of the bended bow. He was the
14673,SECTION XXXI.,"protector of his own character, of his own kinsmen, of the whole world"
14674,SECTION XXXI.,of creation and of virtue and subduer of foes. And banished by his old
14675,SECTION XXXI.,"and truthful sire’s commands, that hero, along with his wife and brother"
14676,SECTION XXXI.,(Lakshmana) repaired to the forest. And while roaming a-hunting in the
14677,SECTION XXXI.,forest he slew many a heroic Rākshasa wearing shapes at will. And having
14678,SECTION XXXI.,heard of the destruction of the Rākshasas of Janasthāna and of Khara and
14679,SECTION XXXI.,"Dushana, the illusive Rāvana, assuming shapes at will, beguiling Rāma,"
14680,SECTION XXXI.,"in the forest, stole away his consort—the Janaka’s daughter. And roaming"
14681,SECTION XXXI.,"the country around in quest of the blameless and worshipful Sitā, Rāma"
14682,SECTION XXXI.,found a firm friend in Sugriva. And bringing about the destruction of
14683,SECTION XXXI.,"Vāli, Rāma, the conqueror of others’ cities, conferred the"
14684,SECTION XXXI.,"monkey-kingdom upon the high-souled Sugriva. And by Sugriva’s decree,"
14685,SECTION XXXI.,"thousands of monkeys, wearing shapes at will, have been searching that"
14686,SECTION XXXI.,worshipful dame in various directions. And by Sampati’s counsel and for
14687,SECTION XXXI.,"that large eyed dame, I have leapt a hundred leagues across the deep. I"
14688,SECTION XXXI.,"have at last got her. And such were the form, grace and the marks that"
14689,SECTION XXXI.,"Rāghava mentioned unto me."" Having said this, the foremost of the"
14690,SECTION XXXI.,monkeys ceased. And greatly wondered was Sitā hearing those words.
14691,SECTION XXXI.,"Thereupon that timid dame, having good curling hair, raising up her face"

14706,SECTION XXXII.,"agitated. And she saw there the humble, sweet-speeched monkey, appearing"
14707,SECTION XXXII.,graceful like unto a collection of full-blown _Asoka_ flowers and having
14708,SECTION XXXII.,eyes resembling burning gold. And observing that foremost of the
14709,SECTION XXXII.,"monkeys, sitting humbly, that daughter of the king of Mithilā, again"
14710,SECTION XXXII.,"greatly amazed, thought.—""This monkey is the most terrible of his race"
14711,SECTION XXXII.,"and therefore hard to be got at and looked at."" Thinking this she again"
14712,SECTION XXXII.,sank in fear. And stricken with grief she again bewailed in piteous
14713,SECTION XXXII.,"accents exclaiming,—""O Rāma! O Lakshmana!"" And she wept silently and"
14714,SECTION XXXII.,"lowly. And then beholding that best of monkeys approach her humbly, the"
14715,SECTION XXXII.,"fair daughter of the Mithili’s king, thought,—""Is this a dream mine eyes"
14716,SECTION XXXII.,"have seen?"" And she again looked towards that Wind-god’s son, the"
14717,SECTION XXXII.,"foremost of the monkeys, the best of those gifted with intelligence,"
14718,SECTION XXXII.,"having a huge disfigured countenance, highly accomplished and wearing a"
14719,SECTION XXXII.,dress mentioned before. And beholding him Sitā was almost out of breath
14720,SECTION XXXII.,with fear. And regaining soon her sense the large-eyed damsel again
14721,SECTION XXXII.,"thought, —""I have seen a very inauspicious dream to-day—to see a monkey"
14722,SECTION XXXII.,"in a dream is reckoned inauspicious by the sages. May good betide Rāma,"
14723,SECTION XXXII.,"Lakshmana and my Sire the king of Janaka. It is no dream, I have not"
14724,SECTION XXXII.,"slept, worn with grief and trouble as I am. Apart from my lord having"
14725,SECTION XXXII.,"the countenance of the full-moon, I have no happiness. Thinking of Rāma"
14726,SECTION XXXII.,"always and uttering his name, each sight I see and each sound I hear"
14727,SECTION XXXII.,brings him to my eye or ear. And therefore his form appearing in my mind
14728,SECTION XXXII.,"is distressing me to-day, who am entirely sunk in his thoughts. And"
14729,SECTION XXXII.,thinking of him always I see him before me and hear his words. Methinks
14730,SECTION XXXII.,this is but a phantom of the mind. And thinking this I still behold the
14731,SECTION XXXII.,same. But an imaginary object can never have a form. And I still find a
14732,SECTION XXXII.,"distinct form addressing me. Be glory to Vāchaspati, Indra, the self"

14743,SECTION XXXIII.,"approached Sitā and joining reverentially his palms, addressed her with"
14744,SECTION XXXIII.,"the following sweet words,—""Who art thou, O thou having eyes like lotus"

14758,SECTION XXXIII.,"tears and sighs, by the earth thou art treading and by calling on a"
14759,SECTION XXXIII.,monarch’s name it appears that thou art not a celestial.³⁴⁶ But from the
14760,SECTION XXXIII.,marks on thy person it appeareth that thou art either the consort or the

14763,SECTION XXXIII.,"From thy wretched plight, thy unrivalled beauty and thy ascetic garb,"
14764,SECTION XXXIII.,"thou art, I ween, for certain, the queen of Rāma."" Hearing those words"
14765,SECTION XXXIII.,"of Hanumān and greatly delighted at Rāma’s name, Vaidehi spoke unto"
14766,SECTION XXXIII.,"him—""I am the daughter-in-law of Daçaratha, knowing his own self, the"
14767,SECTION XXXIII.,"foremost of the kings of the world and the slayer of the enemy’s host,"
14768,SECTION XXXIII.,and the daughter of Janaka the high-souled king of Videha. My name is
14769,SECTION XXXIII.,Sitā and I am the consort of the highly intelligent Rāma. I lived twelve
14770,SECTION XXXIII.,"years in Rāghava’s abode, enjoying every earthly comfort and satisfying"
14771,SECTION XXXIII.,"every desire. And at the beginning of the thirteenth year the king,"
14772,SECTION XXXIII.,"advised by his priest, arranged for the installation of the descendant"
14773,SECTION XXXIII.,of Ikswakus (Rāma) on the throne. And while the articles for the
14774,SECTION XXXIII.,"installation were being collected, the queen Kaikeyi addressed her lord"
14775,SECTION XXXIII.,saying—’I shall not drink or eat for days and this shall be the end of
14776,SECTION XXXIII.,my existence if Rāma be installed. If thou dost not wish to falsify the
14777,SECTION XXXIII.,"vow³⁴⁷ thou made unto me, O best of kings, let Rāma then repair to the"
14778,SECTION XXXIII.,"forest."" The monarch was truthful and remembering his vow and hearing"
14779,SECTION XXXIII.,the unpleasant and vile words of Kaikeyi lost himself (in grief). And
14780,SECTION XXXIII.,"thereupon the old king abiding by truth, weeping, begged of his elslest"
14781,SECTION XXXIII.,"son, the kingdom. The graceful Rāma liked his sire’s command more than"
14782,SECTION XXXIII.,"the installation, and resolving within him, promised to obey his words."
14783,SECTION XXXIII.,"Rāma, having truth for his prowess, never, for his life, takes back what"
14784,SECTION XXXIII.,"he gives, never speaks an untruth and always speaks truth. And leaving"
14785,SECTION XXXIII.,"aside his costly attire, the highly glorious (Rāma) renounced with all"
14786,SECTION XXXIII.,his heart the kingdom and gave me over to his mother. But myself wearing
14787,SECTION XXXIII.,"the garb of an ascetic, repaired speedily before him. Separated from"

14789,SECTION XXXIII.,"son of Sumitrā,the enhancer of friends’ joys, to follow his elder"
14790,SECTION XXXIII.,"brother, dressed himself in bark and _kusa_. And thus abiding by our"
14791,SECTION XXXIII.,"sire’s behest, and taking firm vows we entered a dreary forest never"

14793,SECTION XXXIII.,"in the forest of Dandaka, I, his consort, was stolen by the"

14820,SECTION XXXIV.,"Lakshmana, the beloved follower of thy husband, worn with grief, bows"
14821,SECTION XXXIV.,"his reverential head unto thee."" Hearing of the welfare of those two"
14822,SECTION XXXIV.,"lions among men, the worshipful dame, with all her frame worked up with"
14823,SECTION XXXIV.,"rapture, again spake unto Hanumān, saying—""Verily the wise saw of the"
14824,SECTION XXXIV.,people appears to me to be true that once in a hundred years true joy
14825,SECTION XXXIV.,"appears to a living man"". Sitā, at that time, attained such a wonderful"
14826,SECTION XXXIV.,"joy, as would have been acquired by her in the company (of Rāma and"
14827,SECTION XXXIV.,Lakshmana). And they confidingly conversed with each other. Hearing
14828,SECTION XXXIV.,"those words of Sitā,racked with sorrow, Hanumān, the son of the Wind-god"
14829,SECTION XXXIV.,drew a little nearer to her. The more Hanumān approached her the more
14830,SECTION XXXIV.,"Sitā suspected him as Rāvana. ""Alas! Alas! why have I spoken to him? It"
14831,SECTION XXXIV.,"is the Rāvana, who hath appeared again in a new disguise."" And leaving"
14832,SECTION XXXIV.,"off the Asoka branch, that one having a blameless person, overwhelmed"
14833,SECTION XXXIV.,"with grief, sat down on the earth. In the meantime the mighty-armed"
14834,SECTION XXXIV.,"monkey bowed unto Janaka’s daughter, but she, worked up with fear, did"
14835,SECTION XXXIV.,"not cast again her looks towards him. And beholding him bow unto her,"
14836,SECTION XXXIV.,"Sitā, having a moon-like countenance, sighing, spake unto that monkey in"
14837,SECTION XXXIV.,"sweet accents—""If thou art that Rāvana’s self, who, changing thy shape"
14838,SECTION XXXIV.,"by magic art, want to distress me again—this thy vile deed doth not"
14839,SECTION XXXIV.,"behove thee. Thou art surely that Rāvana, whom I saw at Janasthāna, in a"
14840,SECTION XXXIV.,"mendicant’s guise, renouncing his own shape, O night-ranger, O thou"
14841,SECTION XXXIV.,wearing shapes at will! it doth not behove thee to distress me who am
14842,SECTION XXXIV.,"poorly and famished with fasts. But no, thou canst not be (the fiend)"
14843,SECTION XXXIV.,"whom I suspect, since I have such joy from seeing thee. And may good"
14844,SECTION XXXIV.,"betide thee if thou art Rāma’s messenger. I do ask thee, O foremost of"
14845,SECTION XXXIV.,"monkeys, something about Rāma that is pleasant unto me. O monkey, do"
14846,SECTION XXXIV.,thou relate the glories of my dear Rāma. Thou art (thus) shaking my mind
14847,SECTION XXXIV.,"O gentle one, like unto water breaking down the banks of a river. Alas!"
14848,SECTION XXXIV.,"this dream has afforded me immense pleasure since, I, who have been"
14849,SECTION XXXIV.,"separated from my lord for so long a time, have beheld this monkey sent"
14850,SECTION XXXIV.,by Rāghava. I do not sink even if I can behold in dream the heroic
14851,SECTION XXXIV.,Rāghava along with Lakshmana—but dream even is jealous of my well-being.
14852,SECTION XXXIV.,Nor do I regard this as dream. To behold a monkey in a dream doth not
14853,SECTION XXXIV.,lead to prosperity—whereas I have attained it.³⁴⁸ Or is it mental
14854,SECTION XXXIV.,derangement? Or have I been possessed by a devil? Or have I run mad? Or
14855,SECTION XXXIV.,is it the sultry vapour floating over sands and appearing at a distance
14856,SECTION XXXIV.,"like water? No, it is not madness—for derangement of mind is the sign of"

14858,SECTION XXXIV.,"monkey."" Thinking thus in many a way and ascertaining the strength (of"
14859,SECTION XXXIV.,the monkey and the Rākshasa) Sitā took him for the lord of the
14860,SECTION XXXIV.,"Rākshasas, wearing shapes at will. And having arrived at this decision,"
14861,SECTION XXXIV.,"Janaka’s daughter—Sitā, ceased from talking with that monkey. And"
14862,SECTION XXXIV.,"apprised of Sitā’s thought, Hanumān, the Wind god’s son, (replied) in"

14872,SECTION XXXIV.,"assuming the shape of a dear, Rāghava was taken away from the hermitage"
14873,SECTION XXXIV.,and thou wert stolen away from that lonely place. And soon shall that
14874,SECTION XXXIV.,"powerful (hero) destroy Rāvana in the battle, with fiery arrows,"
14875,SECTION XXXIV.,discharged angrily. I have been sent by him as a messenger to thee. Worn
14876,SECTION XXXIV.,"with grief in thy separation he hath enquired of thy welfare, as well"

14941,SECTION XXXV.,"eyes, nails and palms) are copper-colored— three are cool and three"
14942,SECTION XXXV.,"(voice, navel and gait) are grave. His belly and throat have three folds"
14943,SECTION XXXV.,"of skin. The sole of the foot, the lines thereon and the nipples are"
14944,SECTION XXXV.,"equally bended. His neck, eyes and back are short. He has three locks of"
14945,SECTION XXXV.,hair on his head. He has four lines on his thumb indicating his
14946,SECTION XXXV.,"proficiency in the four Vedas. His body is four hands tall; arms, thighs"
14947,SECTION XXXV.,"and cheeks are plump; eye-brows, the hollows of the nose, eyes, ears,"
14948,SECTION XXXV.,"lips, nipples; wrists, knee-joints, scrotums, hips, hands, feet are all"
14949,SECTION XXXV.,"equally proportioned. Four teeth by the side of each row, are gifted"
14950,SECTION XXXV.,with auspicious marks of the _Sāstras_. His gaits are like those of a
14951,SECTION XXXV.,"lion, tiger, elephant or a bull. His lips and jaws are fleshy and"
14952,SECTION XXXV.,"elevated. His nose is long; words, countenance, nails, down and skin are"
14953,SECTION XXXV.,"all cool; his two arms, two little fingers, two thighs and two legs are"
14954,SECTION XXXV.,"long; his face, eyes, mouth tongue, lips; palate, nipples, nails and"
14955,SECTION XXXV.,"feet are like lotuses, his breast, forehead, neck, arms, navel feet,"
14956,SECTION XXXV.,"back and ears are spacious. He is gifted with grace, fame and"
14957,SECTION XXXV.,"effulgence. His paternal and maternal race are pure. His armpit, belly,"
14958,SECTION XXXV.,"breast, nose, shoulders and forehead are high; his fingers, hairs, down,"
14959,SECTION XXXV.,"nails, skin, beard, eye-sight and intellect are thin and sharp. Rāghava,"
14960,SECTION XXXV.,"with a due division of his time is engaged in acquiring piety, wealth"
14961,SECTION XXXV.,"emancipation and desires. He is truthful and graceful, amasses wealth"
14962,SECTION XXXV.,and thereby protects his subjects. He is cognizant of the divisions of
14963,SECTION XXXV.,time and country and dear unto all. His stepbrother Saumitri is gifted
14964,SECTION XXXV.,"with incomparable prowess and is his equal in attachment, beauty and"
14965,SECTION XXXV.,accomplishments. The person of that graceful one is gold-hued whereas
14966,SECTION XXXV.,that of the highly famous Rāma is green. And those two lions among men
14967,SECTION XXXV.,had no other delight but seeing thee. And they ransacking the whole
14968,SECTION XXXV.,world in quest of thee met us in the forest. And ranging the earth for
14969,SECTION XXXV.,"thee they beheld Sugriva, of comely presence, the lord of monkeys, at"
14970,SECTION XXXV.,"the foot of the mount Rishvamuka covered with trees, banished by his"
14971,SECTION XXXV.,elder brother and resorting there in his fear. And we were serving that
14972,SECTION XXXV.,"truthful Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, driven from the kingdom by his"
14973,SECTION XXXV.,"elder brother. And beholding those two best of men, wearing bark and"
14974,SECTION XXXV.,"with bows in their hands, that best of monkeys, stricken with fear,"
14975,SECTION XXXV.,leaped above and stationed himself on the crest of the hill. He then
14976,SECTION XXXV.,"sent me to them. And thereupon by Sugriva’s decree I, approached with"
14977,SECTION XXXV.,"joined palms, those two foremost of men gifted with beauty and royal"
14978,SECTION XXXV.,"marks. And they were pleased by me, being informed of the real facts."
14979,SECTION XXXV.,And then placing those two best of men on my back I arrived at the top
14980,SECTION XXXV.,of the hill and communicated the truth unto the high-souled Sugriva. And
14981,SECTION XXXV.,conversing with each other those two lords of men and monkeys attained
14982,SECTION XXXV.,great delight. And they consoled each other narrating their respective
14983,SECTION XXXV.,"misfortunes. And Rāma then consoled Sugriva, driven away by his greatly"
14984,SECTION XXXV.,powerful elder brother Vāli on his wife’s account. Thereupon Lakshmana
14985,SECTION XXXV.,"related unto Sugriva, the lord of monkeys, the grief, of Rāma of"
14986,SECTION XXXV.,"unwearied actions, in consequence of thy being borne away (by Rāvana)."
14987,SECTION XXXV.,"And hearing Lakshmana’s words, the lord of monkeys became pale, like"
14988,SECTION XXXV.,unto the radiant Sun possessed by Rāhu. And collecting all those
14989,SECTION XXXV.,"ornaments which were thrown off by thee on the earth, when thou wert"
14990,SECTION XXXV.,"borne away, the leaders of the monkey hosts, delighted brought them"
14991,SECTION XXXV.,before Rāma. But they could not make out thy whereabouts. And all those
14992,SECTION XXXV.,"ornaments, which were handed over to Rāma, were collected by me when"
14993,SECTION XXXV.,"they fell tinkling on the ground, Rāma being beside himself with grief."
14994,SECTION XXXV.,"And placing them on his lap, the god-like Rāma bewailed in various"
14995,SECTION XXXV.,accents. And they inflamed the more Dacarathee’s³⁵⁵ grief. And being
14996,SECTION XXXV.,overwhelmed with grief that high-souled one laid himself low on the
14997,SECTION XXXV.,"ground. And consoling him in various words, I raised him up again. And"
14998,SECTION XXXV.,"looking again and again with Saumitri, at those costly ornaments,"
14999,SECTION XXXV.,"Rāghava handed them over to Sugriva. Rāghava burns in grief, O"
15000,SECTION XXXV.,"worshipful dame, in thy absence, like unto a volcanic mountain burning"
15001,SECTION XXXV.,"with a perpetual fire. For thee, sleeplessness, grief and anxiety are"
15002,SECTION XXXV.,distressing Rāghava like unto three fires³⁵⁶ burning down the fire
15003,SECTION XXXV.,temple. Rāghava is moved by thy separation like unto a huge mountain
15004,SECTION XXXV.,"shaken by a terrible earth-quake. O daughter of a king, he is ranging at"
15005,SECTION XXXV.,"large in many a beautiful forest, river and fountain—but he finds"
15006,SECTION XXXV.,"delight nowhere. O daughter of the king Janaka, bringing about the"
15007,SECTION XXXV.,"destruction of Rāvana, with all his kith and kin, Rāghava, the foremost"
15008,SECTION XXXV.,"of men, shall soon regain thee. And thus Rāma and Sugriva entered into a"
15009,SECTION XXXV.,"friendly covenant, to encompass Vāli’s destruction and to institute"
15010,SECTION XXXV.,enquiries about thee. And thereupon returning to Kishkindhā with those
15011,SECTION XXXV.,"two heroic princes, the lord of monkeys killed Vāli in battle. And"
15012,SECTION XXXV.,"destroying Vāli by his prowess in battle, Rāma made Sugriva king over"
15013,SECTION XXXV.,"all monkeys and bears. And in this way, O dame, the alliance between"
15014,SECTION XXXV.,"Rāma and Sugriva was made. And know me as Hanumān, their messenger who"
15015,SECTION XXXV.,"hath come to thee. Regaining his own kingdom, Sugriva summoned all the"
15016,SECTION XXXV.,mighty monkeys and despatched them in various quarters in quest of thee.
15017,SECTION XXXV.,"And the highly powerful monkeys, resembling mountains, commanded by that"
15018,SECTION XXXV.,"lord of monkeys, proceeded to all the regions of the earth. And"
15019,SECTION XXXV.,"terrified by Sugriva’s decrees, those monkeys, since then, have been"
15020,SECTION XXXV.,ransacking the whole earth for thee. And I am one of them. And the
15021,SECTION XXXV.,"beautiful and mighty son of Vāli, by name Angada, hath proceeded with"
15022,SECTION XXXV.,"three armies under him. And many were the days and nights that we spent,"
15023,SECTION XXXV.,overwhelmed with grief and having lost our way on that best of mountains
15024,SECTION XXXV.,_Vindhya_. We gave up all our hopes for the accomplishment of our end
15025,SECTION XXXV.,and our appointed time was well-nigh spent. And in fear of that lord of
15026,SECTION XXXV.,monkeys we addressed ourselves to put an end to our lives. Ranging the
15027,SECTION XXXV.,"mountain strongholds, rivers and fountains and not finding thy"
15028,SECTION XXXV.,"reverence, we were ready to do away with our existence. And on the crest"
15029,SECTION XXXV.,of that hill we took to fasting. And beholding those foremost of monkeys
15030,SECTION XXXV.,"engaged in fasting Angada, sunk in grief, bewailed, O Vaidehi,"
15031,SECTION XXXV.,"mentioning thy rape, the destruction of Vāli in that way, our fastings"
15032,SECTION XXXV.,"and _Yatāyu’s_ death. While we were thus waiting, ready for death and"
15033,SECTION XXXV.,"giving up all hopes for the fulfillment of our master’s behest, there"
15034,SECTION XXXV.,"appeared,as if the cause of our success, the mighty and powerful"
15035,SECTION XXXV.,"vulture,the brother of _Yatāyu_, by name Sampāti. And hearing of the"
15036,SECTION XXXV.,"destruction of his brother, he in wrath, said—’By whom and where hath my"
15037,SECTION XXXV.,"younger brother been killed? I wish to hear this from you, the foremost"
15038,SECTION XXXV.,of monkeys.’ And Angada related unto him verily _Yatāyu’s_ destruction
15039,SECTION XXXV.,"at Janasthāna, for thee, by that grim-visaged Rākshasa. And hearing of"
15040,SECTION XXXV.,"_Yatāyu’s_ death, Aruna’s son became afflicted with sorrow and informed"
15041,SECTION XXXV.,"us, O thou exquisitely fine damsel, of thy stay in the abode of Rāvana."
15042,SECTION XXXV.,"And hearing those words of Sampāti, enhancing our delight, we all,"
15043,SECTION XXXV.,"headed by Angada, left that place. And leaping from the crest of Vindhya"
15044,SECTION XXXV.,mountain we reached the excellent brink of the Ocean. Being greatly
15045,SECTION XXXV.,"anxious to behold thee and delighted, those plump monkeys headed by"
15046,SECTION XXXV.,"Angada, arrived at the banks of the main. And worked up with a strong"
15047,SECTION XXXV.,"desire to see thee, they again engaged in anxious thought. And beholding"
15048,SECTION XXXV.,"the ocean, the monkey hosts lost their heart. And removing their fear, I"
15049,SECTION XXXV.,"leaped a hundred leagues across the deep and entered Lankā, at night,"
15050,SECTION XXXV.,"infested with demons. I have seen Rāvana, and thee stricken with grief."
15051,SECTION XXXV.,"O thou of a blameless person, I have related all unto thee in regular"
15052,SECTION XXXV.,"order. Do thou speak to me, O worshipful dame, I am Dāçarathee’s"
15053,SECTION XXXV.,"messenger. Do thou know me as the Wind-god’s son, the counsellor of"
15054,SECTION XXXV.,"Sugriva, who am engaged in Rāma’s service and have come here for thee."
15055,SECTION XXXV.,"It is all well with thy Kākuthstha, the foremost of those using weapons,"
15056,SECTION XXXV.,"as well as with Lakshmana, O worshipful dame, gifted with auspicious"
15057,SECTION XXXV.,"marks, engaged in the worship of his superiors and in the well being of"
15058,SECTION XXXV.,"thy lord. By Sugriva’s decree, I alone have reached here. And I, ranging"
15059,SECTION XXXV.,"alone and wearing shapes at will, have come to this southern quarter, to"
15060,SECTION XXXV.,"find out thy whereabouts. By my good luck I shall be able, with thy"
15061,SECTION XXXV.,"news, to remove the grief of those monkey hosts who are lamenting for"
15062,SECTION XXXV.,"thee. By my good fortune, my crossing over the main, hath not become"
15063,SECTION XXXV.,"fruitless. I shall be praised there, O worshiful dame, for I have been"
15064,SECTION XXXV.,able to see thee. And the highly powerful Rāghava shall soon regain
15065,SECTION XXXV.,"thee, destroying, with all his sons and friends, Rāvana the king of"
15066,SECTION XXXV.,"Rākshasas. There is a hill, O Vaidehi, named Mālyabāna, the foremost of"
15067,SECTION XXXV.,"all the mountains. There lives my father, the great monkey _Kesari_."
15068,SECTION XXXV.,"Being commanded by the celestial ascetics, he once repaired thence to"
15069,SECTION XXXV.,the mount _Gokarna_ and at the holy watering place of the lord of the
15070,SECTION XXXV.,rivers he brought about the destruction of (the Asura) _Samvasādana_. O
15071,SECTION XXXV.,"Vaidehi, I was born, on the field, of that monkey. And I am known all"
15072,SECTION XXXV.,"over the world as Hanumān by my own actions. To create thy confidence, O"
15073,SECTION XXXV.,"Vaidehi, I have related thy lord’s accomplishments. And forsooth, thou"
15074,SECTION XXXV.,"shall soon be taken, O worshipful dame, by Rāghava."" Having her"
15075,SECTION XXXV.,"confidence formed by these reasonings and various marks, Sitā, worn with"
15076,SECTION XXXV.,"grief, took him for Rāma’s messenger. And Jānaki attained an excess of"
15077,SECTION XXXV.,delight and shed tears of joy from her eyes having curling eye-lashes.
15078,SECTION XXXV.,"And the beautiful countenance of that large-eyed dame, having spacious"
15079,SECTION XXXV.,"eyes, appeared like the Moon released from the hold of Rāhu. She then"
15080,SECTION XXXV.,took him for a real monkey and none else. Thereupon Hanumān again spoke
15081,SECTION XXXV.,"unto her, having a comely presence,—""I have related unto thee all this."
15082,SECTION XXXV.,"Do thou be consoled, O Maithilee! Tell me now, what am I to do and what"
15083,SECTION XXXV.,dost thou like. I shall soon repair hence. When the Asura _Samvasādana_
15084,SECTION XXXV.,was destroyed in conflict by that best of monkeys at the desire of the
15085,SECTION XXXV.,"celestial ascetics, I was born of the Wind, O Maithilee. I look like a"

15114,SECTION XXXVI.,"taking the ring that used to deck her lord’s finger and looking at it,"

15119,SECTION XXXVI.,"applauded that great monkey—""O foremost of monkeys, thou art brave,"
15120,SECTION XXXVI.,"powerful and wise, since thou hast alone smitten this abode of the"
15121,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasas. Thou hast, with thy laudable prowess, leaped, a hundred"

15123,SECTION XXXVI.,"_Goshpada_.³⁵⁷ O foremost of monkeys, I do not consider thee as an"

15125,SECTION XXXVI.,"monkeys, thou art worthy of my welcome, since thou hast been despatched"
15126,SECTION XXXVI.,"by Rāma, knowing self. Rāma, hard of being got at, hath not sent thee,"
15127,SECTION XXXVI.,"specially to me, without a trial of thy prowess. By my good luck, is it"
15128,SECTION XXXVI.,all well with the virtuous-souled and truthful Rāma and the highly

15130,SECTION XXXVI.,"lives untouched by ill, then why does he not burn the earth, encircled"
15131,SECTION XXXVI.,"by the ocean, with his ire like unto the fire of dissolution? Or they"
15132,SECTION XXXVI.,are capable of His comfitting the celestials in a battle but me-thinks
15133,SECTION XXXVI.,"by my ill-luck, the end of my miseries hath not arrived as yet. Is Rāma"
15134,SECTION XXXVI.,greatly pained? Does he grieve? Is that foremost of men making
15135,SECTION XXXVI.,preparations for my rescue? Has he forgotten his work being overwhelmed
15136,SECTION XXXVI.,with fear and poorliness of heart? Is that son of the king performing
15137,SECTION XXXVI.,"still his manly duties? Is that slayer of foes, desirous of acquiring"
15138,SECTION XXXVI.,"victory, pleasing his friends still with forgiveness and gifts and"
15139,SECTION XXXVI.,"dealing his enemies with punishment, sowing dissensions amongst them,"
15140,SECTION XXXVI.,and with other expedients? Is he still gaining friends and are friends
15141,SECTION XXXVI.,gathering around him? Is he welcoming his friends and are they honoring
15142,SECTION XXXVI.,him the more? Is that son of the king invoking the blessings of the
15143,SECTION XXXVI.,celestials? Hath he attained manliness and assistance from the
15144,SECTION XXXVI.,celestials? Hath Rāghava lost all his affection for me for my living at

15146,SECTION XXXVI.,"ever used to happiness and unused to misery, been enfeebled by this"
15147,SECTION XXXVI.,"disaster? Is he informed always of the welfare of Kauslaya, Sumitrā and"
15148,SECTION XXXVI.,"Bharata? Is not Rāghava, worthy of honors, beside himself with grief in"

15150,SECTION XXXVI.,"his brother, send out one Aksauhini of terrible soldiers under the"
15151,SECTION XXXVI.,"command of his ministers for my rescue? Will not the graceful Sugriva,"
15152,SECTION XXXVI.,the lord of the monkeys come to help me with hosts of monkeys having
15153,SECTION XXXVI.,"huge teeth and nails? Will not the heroic Lakshmana, the enhancer of"
15154,SECTION XXXVI.,"Sumitrā’s joy, conversant with the use of weapons, burn down the"
15155,SECTION XXXVI.,Rākshasas with his shafts? Shall I not behold soon that Rāvana with his

15160,SECTION XXXVI.,"kingdom for virtue and repairing, on foot with me even to the forest,"

15163,SECTION XXXVI.,"messenger, I shall keep my life so long I do not hear anything about my"
15164,SECTION XXXVI.,"dear one."" Having addressed that lord of monkeys with these highly sound"
15165,SECTION XXXVI.,"and sweet accents, that graceful and worshipful dame ceased, with a view"
15166,SECTION XXXVI.,to hear again from him pleasant tales regarding Rāma. And hearing the
15167,SECTION XXXVI.,"words of Sitā the terribly powerful Māruti, placing his joined palms on"
15168,SECTION XXXVI.,"his head said,—""The lotus-eyed Rāma doth not know that thou art here,"
15169,SECTION XXXVI.,and hence he hath not been able to rescue thee like unto Purandara
15170,SECTION XXXVI.,regaining Sachee. And hearing about thee from me soon shall Rāghava come
15171,SECTION XXXVI.,assisted by a large army of monkeys and bears. And impeding the course
15172,SECTION XXXVI.,"of the unagitated deep and building, by means of his terrible shafts, a"
15173,SECTION XXXVI.,"bridge across it, Kākuthstha, shall divest the city Lankā of all the"
15174,SECTION XXXVI.,"Rākshasas. And forsooth shall Rāma destroy them, even if the celestials,"
15175,SECTION XXXVI.,"or Death himself stand in his way. O worshipful dame, stricken with"
15176,SECTION XXXVI.,"grief in thy absence, Rāma is restless like unto an elephant smitten by"
15177,SECTION XXXVI.,"a lion. I can swear, O worshipful dame, by the mounts Mandāra, Malaya,"
15178,SECTION XXXVI.,"Vindya, Sumeru, Dardura and all the fruits and roots, that thou shalt"
15179,SECTION XXXVI.,"behold like unto the rising of the full moon, the countenance of Rāma"
15180,SECTION XXXVI.,"having beautiful eyes, graceful, _Bimba_-like lips and beautified with"
15181,SECTION XXXVI.,"beautiful _kundalas_. Thou shalt soon behold, O Vaidehi, Rāma, on the"
15182,SECTION XXXVI.,"mount Prasravana, like unto the performer of hundred sacrifices seated"
15183,SECTION XXXVI.,on the back of the elephant (_Airavata_). Rāghava doth not take meat nor
15184,SECTION XXXVI.,drink honey—he takes every day in the evening boiled rice and such wild
15185,SECTION XXXVI.,fruits as are sanctioned by the _Sastras_. His heart is so much attached
15186,SECTION XXXVI.,"unto thee, that he does not drive away even flies, insects and snakes"
15187,SECTION XXXVI.,"from his body. Rāma is always engaged in meditations, overwhelmed with"
15188,SECTION XXXVI.,"grief, and he has no other thought but seeing thee. Rāma hath no sleep"
15189,SECTION XXXVI.,and even when asleep that best of men awakes exclaiming in sweet
15190,SECTION XXXVI.,"accents, ’O Sitā!’. He always welcomes thee sighing and saying ""O my"
15191,SECTION XXXVI.,"dear love!"" whenever he beholds any fruit, flower or any object liked by"
15192,SECTION XXXVI.,"the ladies. O worshipful dame, he is always lamenting, exclaiming ’O"
15193,SECTION XXXVI.,"Sitā!’ and that high-souled son of the king, to regain thee, hath"
15194,SECTION XXXVI.,"resorted to ascetic observances."" On hearing about Rlma, Sitā was"
15195,SECTION XXXVI.,greatly delighted and she was equally grieved on hearing of his sorrow.
15196,SECTION XXXVI.,And it appeared like the rising of the moon and the appearance of the

15230,SECTION XXXVII.,soon regain me for pure is my soul and he is gifted with many
15231,SECTION XXXVII.,"accomplishments. Rāghava hath in him, O monkey, energy, manliness,"
15232,SECTION XXXVII.,"strength, kindness, gratitude and prowess. He brought about without his"
15233,SECTION XXXVII.,"brother’s aid, the destruction of the fourteen thousand Rākshasas at"
15234,SECTION XXXVII.,Janasthāna. What enemy is not troubled at this? The disaster-creating
15235,SECTION XXXVII.,Rākshasas can never be compared with that best of men. I am cognizant of
15236,SECTION XXXVII.,"his prowess as Sachee is of Indra’s. O monkey, Rāma the Sun, with his"
15237,SECTION XXXVII.,"arrow-like rays, shall dry up the water—the inimical Rākshasas."" Saying"
15238,SECTION XXXVII.,"this she was overwhelmed with grief on Rāma’s account, and Hanumān again"
15239,SECTION XXXVII.,"spoke unto her having her countenance bathed in tears,—""No sooner shall"
15240,SECTION XXXVII.,Rāghava hear from me than he shall speedily repair hither followed by a
15241,SECTION XXXVII.,huge army of monkeys and bears. Or I shall release thee even to-day from
15242,SECTION XXXVII.,the grasp of that Rākshasa and these miseries. Do thou place thyself on
15243,SECTION XXXVII.,"my back, O thou of a blameless person. And having thee on my back I"
15244,SECTION XXXVII.,shall leap over the main. I am capable of carrying the city of Lankā
15245,SECTION XXXVII.,"even with Rāvana. I shall restore thee to-day, O Maithili, unto Rāghava"
15246,SECTION XXXVII.,"on the mount Prasravana, like unto fire carrying unto Indra, the"
15247,SECTION XXXVII.,"sacrificial offerings. Thou shalt behold to-day, O Vaidehi, Rāma along"
15248,SECTION XXXVII.,"with Lakshmana, making preparations (for the destruction of his enemy)"
15249,SECTION XXXVII.,"like unto Vishnu, engaged in the destruction of demons. (And thou shalt"
15250,SECTION XXXVII.,"observe) that highly powerful one, anxious to behold thee and seated"
15251,SECTION XXXVII.,like unto Purandara on the summit of that foremost of mountains. Do thou
15252,SECTION XXXVII.,"place thyself on my back, O worshipful dame, do thou not neglect it, O"
15253,SECTION XXXVII.,"beautiful lady, and be thus reconciled unto Rāma like unto Rohini"
15254,SECTION XXXVII.,"restored to the Moon. By the time, that we will take in talking thus,"
15255,SECTION XXXVII.,thou shalt reach Rāma like Rohini restored to the Moon. Do thou
15256,SECTION XXXVII.,therefore place thyself on my back and I shall cross the ocean sailing
15257,SECTION XXXVII.,"by the aetherial way. O fair one, carrying thee from this place, none"
15258,SECTION XXXVII.,amongst the inhabitants of Lankā shall be able to follow me. In the same
15259,SECTION XXXVII.,"way I have come here I shall return by the welkin, O Vaidehi placing"
15260,SECTION XXXVII.,"thee on my back."" Hearing those surprising words from that best of"
15261,SECTION XXXVII.,"monkeys, Maithilee, having her entire frame worked up with joy, again"
15262,SECTION XXXVII.,"bespake Hanumin—""Hanumān, how darest thou take me to such a long"
15263,SECTION XXXVII.,"distance? O lord of monkey hosts, this attests to thy monkey hood. O"
15264,SECTION XXXVII.,"foremost of monkeys, little-bodied as thou art, how dost thou desire, to"
15265,SECTION XXXVII.,"take me hence to my husband the lord of men?"" Hearing the words of Sitā,"
15266,SECTION XXXVII.,"the graceful son of the Wind-god Hanumān reflected aside—""This is my"
15267,SECTION XXXVII.,first insult. The lotus-eyed dame is not cognizant of my prowess or
15268,SECTION XXXVII.,strength. Vaidehi should therefore learn that I can assume shapes at
15269,SECTION XXXVII.,"will."" Thinking thus, Hanumān, the foremost of the monkeys and the"
15270,SECTION XXXVII.,"slayer of foes, showed himself unto Sitā, in his true shape. And leaping"
15271,SECTION XXXVII.,"down from the tree, that best of monkeys began to increase himself to"
15272,SECTION XXXVII.,create Sitā’s confidence. His person appeared like the hill Mandāra and
15273,SECTION XXXVII.,the flaming fire. And that best of monkeys having a copper-colored
15274,SECTION XXXVII.,"countenance, thunder-like nails and teeth and mountain-like huge body,"
15275,SECTION XXXVII.,"appeared before Sitā and said—""I am capable of carrying this Lankā with"
15276,SECTION XXXVII.,"her lord, the mountains, forests gardens, buildings, walls and"
15277,SECTION XXXVII.,"gate-ways. Do thou therefore confide in me, O worshipful dame, and be"
15278,SECTION XXXVII.,"not suspicious. And O Vaidehi, do thou remove Rāma’s grief as well as"
15279,SECTION XXXVII.,"Lakshmana’s."" Beholding the Wind-god’s own begotten son, Hanumān,"
15280,SECTION XXXVII.,"resembling a huge mountain, Sitā, the daughter of Janaka, having eyes"
15281,SECTION XXXVII.,"resembling lotus-petals, said,—""O great monkey, I know thy strength and"
15282,SECTION XXXVII.,"bravery, thy air-like motion and thy wonderful fire-like energy. What"
15283,SECTION XXXVII.,ordinary man can come here crossing the incomparable ocean. O lord of
15284,SECTION XXXVII.,"monkey hosts, I understand that thou art capable of returning and thou"
15285,SECTION XXXVII.,shalt be able to carry me. But I should consider now how the work might
15286,SECTION XXXVII.,"be accomplished. O foremost of monkeys, I should not go with thee."
15287,SECTION XXXVII.,Perhaps I might lose my sense with thy air-like velocity. When moving
15288,SECTION XXXVII.,"terribly thou shalt proceed high up in the welkin, perhaps I shall then"
15289,SECTION XXXVII.,fall down. No sooner I shall fall down into the ocean infested with fish
15290,SECTION XXXVII.,and other animals than I shall be an excellent food unto them. O slayer
15291,SECTION XXXVII.,"of foes, I shall not be able to accompany thee. For seeing thee carry a"
15292,SECTION XXXVII.,"woman; they shall surely suspect thee. And finding me stolen, those"
15293,SECTION XXXVII.,"terribly powerful Rākshasas commanded by the vicious-souled Rāvana,"
15294,SECTION XXXVII.,"shall follow thee. O hero, carrying me and encircled by those heroic"
15295,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rākshasas with maces and darts in their hands, thou shalt be beset with"
15296,SECTION XXXVII.,dangers. And on the sky the Rākshasas shall be armed with weapons and
15297,SECTION XXXVII.,thou shalt be without any. How shalt thou be able to fight and protect
15298,SECTION XXXVII.,me at the same time. And when thou shalt be engaged in conflict with
15299,SECTION XXXVII.,"those Rākshasas of terrible deeds, I, O foremost of monkeys, stricken"
15300,SECTION XXXVII.,"with fear, shall fall down from thy back. O foremost of monkeys those"
15301,SECTION XXXVII.,terrible and powerful Rākshasas shall be able to defeat thee a little.
15302,SECTION XXXVII.,And when thou shalt be defeated in battle I shall fall down and those
15303,SECTION XXXVII.,vicious Rākshasas shall carry me away from thy hands or destroy me.
15304,SECTION XXXVII.,Victory or defeat is uncertain in a battle. I shall thus be distressed
15305,SECTION XXXVII.,by those Rākshasas setting up terrible roars and thy endeavours shall be
15306,SECTION XXXVII.,"fruitless, O best of monkeys. Thou art capable of destroying the"
15307,SECTION XXXVII.,Rākshasas very easily (I admit)—but Rāma’s fame shall then be soiled if
15308,SECTION XXXVII.,dost thou bring about their destruction. Or the Rākshasas taking me away
15309,SECTION XXXVII.,"shall keep me in such a secret place, that neither the monkeys nor"
15310,SECTION XXXVII.,Rāghava shall be able to ascertain my whereabouts. And all thy
15311,SECTION XXXVII.,preparations for me shall thus be useless. And mighty shall be the
15312,SECTION XXXVII.,"result of Rāma’s coming with thee. O large armed one, the life of"
15313,SECTION XXXVII.,"Rāghava of unmitigated prowess, those of his brothers and of thy royal"
15314,SECTION XXXVII.,race are all subject to me. And when they shall give up their hopes of
15315,SECTION XXXVII.,"releasing me, they, worn out with grief and anxiety shall renounce their"
15316,SECTION XXXVII.,"lives along with the monkeys and bears. O monkey, being guided by my"
15317,SECTION XXXVII.,"love for my husband, I do not like willingly to touch any body’s person"
15318,SECTION XXXVII.,"but Rāma’s. When Rāvana, by force touched my person, I had no other"
15319,SECTION XXXVII.,"help, for I was then without my lord and therefore was subject to"
15320,SECTION XXXVII.,"another person. If Rāma can take me away from here, destroying the"
15321,SECTION XXXVII.,Ten-necked one with all the Rākshasas—he shall then perform the worthy
15322,SECTION XXXVII.,action. I have heard of and myself seen the prowess of the highly-souled
15323,SECTION XXXVII.,"(Rāma) unconquerable in a battle. There is none amongst the celestials,"
15324,SECTION XXXVII.,"Gandharbas, Nāgas and the Rākshasas who can match him in a conflict"
15325,SECTION XXXVII.,"Beholding that highly powerful Rāghava, in a conflict, like unto Vāsava"
15326,SECTION XXXVII.,"in prowess, holding a wonderful bow and followed by Lakshmana, who can"
15327,SECTION XXXVII.,withstand his prowess resembling the flaming fire? O foremost of
15328,SECTION XXXVII.,"monkeys, who can withstand Rāghava in a conflict, followed by Lakshmana"
15329,SECTION XXXVII.,moving like an infuriated elephant and showering shafts like unto the
15330,SECTION XXXVII.,rays of the sun at the time of Dissolution? O best of monkeys do thou
15331,SECTION XXXVII.,speedily bring here my dear one along with Lakshmana and the lord of
15332,SECTION XXXVII.,"monkey hosts. O heroic monkey, do thou soon satisfy me, who am stricken"
15333,SECTION XXXVII.,with grief in consequence of my long separation from Rāma.
15334,SECTION XXXVII.,
15335,SECTION XXXVII.,
15336,SECTION XXXVII.,
15337,SECTION XXXVIII.,SECTION XXXVIII.
15338,SECTION XXXVIII.,
15339,SECTION XXXVIII.,
15340,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Hearing those words, that foremost of monkeys, skilled in speech, was"
15341,SECTION XXXVIII.,"greatly delighted and again addressed Sitā in the following words,—""O"
15342,SECTION XXXVIII.,"worshipful lady, O thou of an auspicious presence, what thou hast said,"
15343,SECTION XXXVIII.,speaks well for a feminine nature and the modesty of a chaste damsel.
15344,SECTION XXXVIII.,"And because thou art a female, thou art not capable of crossing on my"
15345,SECTION XXXVIII.,"back, the main extending over a thousand leagues. The second argument—I"
15346,SECTION XXXVIII.,"shall not touch any other person’s body than Rāma’s, which thou hast"
15347,SECTION XXXVIII.,"produced, O Jānaki! O thou gifted with modesty! truly becometh thee, who"
15348,SECTION XXXVIII.,"art the spouse of that high-souled one. Who else than thee, O worshipful"
15349,SECTION XXXVIII.,"one, can give expression to such words? Truly shall Kākutstha hear from"
15350,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the beginning to the end, O worshipful dame, of thy actions before me,"
15351,SECTION XXXVIII.,"and all thou hast said. For many reasons, I gave vent to such words, O"
15352,SECTION XXXVIII.,"lady,—I am anxious to compass Rāma’s end, and my heart is melted with"
15353,SECTION XXXVIII.,"affection. It is very difficult to enter this city of Lankā, it is"
15354,SECTION XXXVIII.,equally hard to cross over the main —but I am capable of doing all
15355,SECTION XXXVIII.,"these, and hence I gave utterance to all those words. I wish to take"
15356,SECTION XXXVIII.,thee even today to the descendant of Raghu. It is for my devotion unto
15357,SECTION XXXVIII.,him and regard for thee that I said so and for nothing else. If thou
15358,SECTION XXXVIII.,"dost not wish to go with me, O thou of a blameless person, do thou give"
15359,SECTION XXXVIII.,"me such a token as might create Rāghava’s confidence."" Being thus"
15360,SECTION XXXVIII.,"accosted by Hanumān, Sitā resembling the daughter of a celestial, spoke,"
15361,SECTION XXXVIII.,"gently, words with their letters strung on the vapour of grief,—""Do thou"
15362,SECTION XXXVIII.,mention unto my dear lord (in my words) what had happened unto me while
15363,SECTION XXXVIII.,"living in the hermitage at the foot of the mount _Pratyanga_, situate on"
15364,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the north-east of Chitrakuta, abounding in roots, fruits and water. ’At"
15365,SECTION XXXVIII.,no distance from that place frequented by the ascetics flowed the sacred
15366,SECTION XXXVIII.,stream Mandākini. While ranging in that woodland fragrant with the odour
15367,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of many flowers, thou, having thy person wet in consequence of thy sport"
15368,SECTION XXXVIII.,"in the water, didst sit on my lap. A crow, at that time, longing to feed"
15369,SECTION XXXVIII.,"on my flesh, tore my breast With its beak. And I threatened it with a"
15370,SECTION XXXVIII.,pebble. But it continued tearing my breast as if it sat there to feed on
15371,SECTION XXXVIII.,"my flesh and therefore did not fly off. Being enraged with that bird, as"
15372,SECTION XXXVIII.,"I tried to tighten the cloth around my waist, it gave way a little, and"
15373,SECTION XXXVIII.,"thou, rising up from thy seat and looking at me, didst laugh over it."
15374,SECTION XXXVIII.,"And I was greatly enraged with thy laughter and ashamed, and, being"
15375,SECTION XXXVIII.,"wounded by the crow, I approached thee. Thereupon, tired as I was, I sat"
15376,SECTION XXXVIII.,"on thy lap, and, exercised with ire, I was consoled by thee laughing."
15377,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Now I, having my countenance bathed in tears, gently rubbed my eyes. And"
15378,SECTION XXXVIII.,"I was seen by thee, O my lord, in that wise, greatly enraged with the"
15379,SECTION XXXVIII.,"crow. O Rāghava, I slept for sometime, at thy lap, out of exhaustion,"
15380,SECTION XXXVIII.,"and thyself in turn, slept at mine, O elder brother of Bharata. In the"
15381,SECTION XXXVIII.,"meantime, that crow again suddenly approaching, tore my breast with its"
15382,SECTION XXXVIII.,"beak, as I awoke and was rising up from thy lap, O Rāghava. Thereupon"
15383,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Rāghava awoke with the shedding of blood. Beholding my breast wounded,"
15384,SECTION XXXVIII.,"that larged-armed hero wroth like a serpent, sighing, said,—O thou"
15385,SECTION XXXVIII.,"having thighs like the trunk of an elephant, by whom hath thy breast"
15386,SECTION XXXVIII.,been wounded? Who wants to play with an angry five-hooded
15387,SECTION XXXVIII.,"serpent?—Thereupon, casting his looks around, he espied the crow,"
15388,SECTION XXXVIII.,"sitting in my front with its claws besmeared with blood. That crow, best"
15389,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of birds, was the son of the lord of the celestials in disguise. And"
15390,SECTION XXXVIII.,"gifted with air-like velocity, he speedily entered inside the earth."
15391,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Thereupon that large-eyed hero, best of the intelligent, with his eyes"
15392,SECTION XXXVIII.,"whirling with ire, resolved to destroy that crow. And taking a blade of"
15393,SECTION XXXVIII.,"_Kuça_ off his seat, he tied it to a _Brahma_ weapon. And that blade,"
15394,SECTION XXXVIII.,"facing the bird, appeared with its flaming face, like the fire that"
15395,SECTION XXXVIII.,would destroy the world. And he hurled that burning blade at the crow.
15396,SECTION XXXVIII.,"And it pursued the crow high up in the welkin. Being thus pursued, that"
15397,SECTION XXXVIII.,"crow, in order to save himself, traversed various regions. And being"
15398,SECTION XXXVIII.,"then renounced by his father (Indra) and the great ascetics, he, ranging"
15399,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the three worlds, at last resorted to his (Rāma’s) shelter. And, placing"
15400,SECTION XXXVIII.,"himself on the earth, he sought his shelter, and Kākutstha, out of"
15401,SECTION XXXVIII.,"mercy, saved him, albeit worthy of being killed. And he spoke unto him,"
15402,SECTION XXXVIII.,"greatly famished, of a pale countenance and lying on the earth,—It is"
15403,SECTION XXXVIII.,"impossible to render this _Brahma_ weapon fruitless. Therefore, do thou"
15404,SECTION XXXVIII.,speak (as to what is to be done.)—He then destroyed the right eye of the
15405,SECTION XXXVIII.,"crow. Having given up his eye, he saved himself. Then bowing unto Rāma"
15406,SECTION XXXVIII.,"as well as king Daçaratha, the crow, liberated by that hero, went to his"
15407,SECTION XXXVIII.,own abode. ’Thou hadst on my behalf discharged the Brahma weapon even at
15408,SECTION XXXVIII.,"a crow. Why then, O lord of earth, dost thou forbear him who had carried"
15409,SECTION XXXVIII.,"me off from thee? O foremost of men, do thou dispense unto me thy"
15410,SECTION XXXVIII.,"kindness capable of inspiring hope. O lord, possessing a lord in thee, I"
15411,SECTION XXXVIII.,(now) appear as if I had none. That kindness is a prime virtue—I have
15412,SECTION XXXVIII.,heard even from thee; and I know that thou art exceedingly energetic and
15413,SECTION XXXVIII.,"possessed of great strength and high courage,—unfettered by"
15414,SECTION XXXVIII.,"considerations of time and space, incapable of being agitated, thou in"
15415,SECTION XXXVIII.,"gravity resemblest the ocean, and like unto that lord of the earth"
15416,SECTION XXXVIII.,"furnished with seas—Vāsava. O Rāghava, being thus the foremost of those"
15417,SECTION XXXVIII.,"acquainted with weapons, powerful, and possessed of strength, wherefore"
15418,SECTION XXXVIII.,"dost thou not direct thy weapon against the Rākshasas?’ Neither _Nāgas_,"
15419,SECTION XXXVIII.,"nor Gandharbas, nor the gods, nor the Maruts, are competent to resist"
15420,SECTION XXXVIII.,the onset of Rāma in battle. If that puissant one still retains any
15421,SECTION XXXVIII.,"regard for me, why doth he not by means of sharpened shafts make root"
15422,SECTION XXXVIII.,"and branch work with the Rākshasas? And why, taking the permission of"
15423,SECTION XXXVIII.,"his brother, that repressor of foes, the heroic Lakshmana gifted with"
15424,SECTION XXXVIII.,"great strength, doth not deliver me? If those foremost of men be indeed"
15425,SECTION XXXVIII.,"equal to Indra and the Wind, and incapable of being repressed even by"
15426,SECTION XXXVIII.,"the celestials, wherefore do they disregard me? Surely I must be guilty"
15427,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of some great crime, since although capable, those subduers of enemies"
15428,SECTION XXXVIII.,do not look at me.’ Hearing Vaidehi’s piteous words uttered with tearful
15429,SECTION XXXVIII.,"eyes, that leader of monkey-bands, the exceedingly energetic Hanumān,"
15430,SECTION XXXVIII.,"said,—""O exalted one, I swear by truth, Rāma turneth away his"
15431,SECTION XXXVIII.,countenance (from every work) in consequence of grief for thee. And Rāma
15432,SECTION XXXVIII.,"being seized with sorrow, Lakshmana burns in grief. Now that I have been"
15433,SECTION XXXVIII.,"able to obtain a sight of thee, this is no season for sorrow. O"
15434,SECTION XXXVIII.,"auspicious one, even now thou shalt witness the end of this woe. Filled"
15435,SECTION XXXVIII.,"with hope from my sight of thee, those foremost of persons, those mighty"
15436,SECTION XXXVIII.,"princes, shall reduce the worlds to ashes. And, O thou of expansive"
15437,SECTION XXXVIII.,"eyes, slaying in battle the wicked Rāvana with his allies, Rāghava shall"
15438,SECTION XXXVIII.,take thee back to his palace. Now tell me what I shall communicate unto
15439,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Rāghava, and the highly powerful Lakshmana, and the energetic Sugriva,"
15440,SECTION XXXVIII.,"and all the assembled monkeys."" Thus addressed, Sitā again spoke unto"
15441,SECTION XXXVIII.,"him, saying,—Do thou on my behalf, bowing down the head, enquire after"
15442,SECTION XXXVIII.,the welfare of that protector of men whom Kaucalyā hath brought forth.
15443,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Do thou on my behalf, and on account of my words, enquire after the"
15444,SECTION XXXVIII.,"welfare of him, who, renouncing wreaths and gems of all kinds, and"
15445,SECTION XXXVIII.,"beloved damsels possessed of transcendent beauty, and wealth such as is"
15446,SECTION XXXVIII.,"difficult to obtain on this spacious earth; and who, honoring and bowing"
15447,SECTION XXXVIII.,"unto his father and mother, followed Rāma,—in whom Sumitra hath an"
15448,SECTION XXXVIII.,"excellent son,—of that righteous one, who, espousing the cause of his"
15449,SECTION XXXVIII.,"brother, renouncing choice happiness, followeth his brother to the"
15450,SECTION XXXVIII.,"forest, ministering unto him; who is lion-shouldered, long-armed,"
15451,SECTION XXXVIII.,"intelligent, and of a prepossessing presence; who beareth himself"
15452,SECTION XXXVIII.,"towards Rāma as if he were his sire, and towards me, as if I were his"
15453,SECTION XXXVIII.,mother; of that heroic Lakshmana who did not know when I was ravished
15454,SECTION XXXVIII.,"away;—the servant of the elders, crowned with auspiciousness,—who is"
15455,SECTION XXXVIII.,competent and reineth in his tongue; who is the foremost of those dear
15456,SECTION XXXVIII.,"unto the king’s son,³⁵⁸ and worthy of my father-in-law; who is dearer"
15457,SECTION XXXVIII.,"[unto Rāma) than even my own self; of Lakshmana, brother into Rāma; that"
15458,SECTION XXXVIII.,"energetic one who undertaketh even such tasks as he is not equal to, and"
15459,SECTION XXXVIII.,"seeing whom Rāghava hath forgotten his deceased sire³⁵⁹,—him for the"
15460,SECTION XXXVIII.,"sake of my words, thou must ask as to his welfare. Lakshmana is always"
15461,SECTION XXXVIII.,"mild and pure, and dear unto Rāma. Do thou speak to him so, that, O best"
15462,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of monkeys, he may remove my miseries. O leader of monkey-bands, do thou"
15463,SECTION XXXVIII.,bring about success on this undertaking. From this preliminary endeavour
15464,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of thine, Rāghava shall take pains on my behalf.—This also shalt thou"
15465,SECTION XXXVIII.,"say again and again unto that hero—my lord,—’O son of Daçaratha, I shall"
15466,SECTION XXXVIII.,keep on this life for another month; and this I swear unto thee by truth
15467,SECTION XXXVIII.,"that I will not live beyond this month. O hero, even as Vishnu rescued"
15468,SECTION XXXVIII.,"Kauçiki from the nether regions,³⁶⁰ it behoveth thee to rescue me, who"
15469,SECTION XXXVIII.,"have ignominiously been confined by the impious Rāvana.""— Thereupon,"
15470,SECTION XXXVIII.,"saying,—""Hand this unto Rāghava,"" Sitā gave to Hanumān a noble and"
15471,SECTION XXXVIII.,"excellent jewel for the head³⁶¹, which was tied up in her attire. Then"
15472,SECTION XXXVIII.,"taking that best of gems, the hero tried to fix it on his finger; but it"
15473,SECTION XXXVIII.,"did not enter into it.³⁶² And taking the gem, and bowing unto Sitā and"
15474,SECTION XXXVIII.,"going round her, that foremost of monkeys remained by her side in humble"
15475,SECTION XXXVIII.,"guise. And experiencing rapture in consequence of his seeing Sitā, he"
15476,SECTION XXXVIII.,"mentally presented himself before Rāma, and Lakshmana graced with"
15477,SECTION XXXVIII.,"auspicious marks. And taking that costly and superb gem, which by virtue"
15478,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of some power, king Janaka’s daughter had managed to hide (from the gaze"
15479,SECTION XXXVIII.,"of the Rāshasis), Hanumlān, feeling delighted like one, shaken by the"
15480,SECTION XXXVIII.,"wind blowing on the top of the foremost of mountains, and then getting"
15481,SECTION XXXVIII.,"away from it, prepared to set out."

15511,SECTION XXXIX.,"remove (my) misery. O Hanumān, undergoing toils, be thou instrumental in"
15512,SECTION XXXIX.,"removing my misery."" Saying, ""So be it,"" the Wind-god’s offspring of"
15513,SECTION XXXIX.,"terrible prowess, bowing down the head, prepared to depart. Seeing that"
15514,SECTION XXXIX.,"(Hanumān) was about to set out, that exalted one, Mithilā’s daughter,"
15515,SECTION XXXIX.,"addressed that monkey, son unto the Wind-god, in words choked by the"
15516,SECTION XXXIX.,"vapour of grief,—""O Hanumān, do thou communicate good news to both Rāma"
15517,SECTION XXXIX.,"and Lakshmana, to Sugriva with his counsellors, and to all the aged"
15518,SECTION XXXIX.,"monkeys. And, O best of monkeys, in consonance with righteousness,"
15519,SECTION XXXIX.,communicate good tidings (unto Rāma). And it behoveth thee to strive so
15520,SECTION XXXIX.,that the mighty-armed Rāghava may rescue me from this sea of sorrow.
15521,SECTION XXXIX.,"And, O Hanumān, do thou speak so that the illustrious Rāma may deliver"
15522,SECTION XXXIX.,me while I am still alive; and thereby do thou reap righteousness. Ever
15523,SECTION XXXIX.,"breathing high spirits, Dācarathi,³⁶³ hearing my words, shall attain an"
15524,SECTION XXXIX.,access of manliness for my deliverance. Soon as Rāghava shall hear words
15525,SECTION XXXIX.,"couching tidings of me, that hero shall duly resolve on displaying his"
15526,SECTION XXXIX.,"prowess."" Hearing this speech of Sitā, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god,"
15527,SECTION XXXIX.,"with his joined hands raised to his head, said,—""Soon shall Kākutstha"
15528,SECTION XXXIX.,"come, surrounded by the foremost monkeys and bears; and, vanquishing the"
15529,SECTION XXXIX.,"foe in fight, shall remove thy grief. Find I none either among men, or"
15530,SECTION XXXIX.,"Asuras, or celestials, that dares remain before him as he discharges his"
15531,SECTION XXXIX.,"shafts. For thee, in especial, he can stand in conflict even the Sun,"
15532,SECTION XXXIX.,"Indra, nay—Yama himself, that offspring of the Sun. For thee, he"
15533,SECTION XXXIX.,"prepareth himself to conquer the Earth bounded by the main; and victory,"
15534,SECTION XXXIX.,"thou daughter of Janaka, shall be Rāma’s."" Hearing his words excellently"
15535,SECTION XXXIX.,"spoken and thoroughly true, Jānaki honored them highly, and spoke (as"
15536,SECTION XXXIX.,"follows). And gazing at him once and again as he prepared to go away,"
15537,SECTION XXXIX.,Sitā from affection honored the speech which had been uttered (by
15538,SECTION XXXIX.,"Hanuroan) out of attachment unto his master,— ""If thou wish it, O hero,"
15539,SECTION XXXIX.,"do thou, O subduer of enemies, stay here for one day. Having rested in"
15540,SECTION XXXIX.,"some hidden nook, thou wilt depart to-morrow. O monkey, (if thou dost"
15541,SECTION XXXIX.,"remain), thy vicinity shall for a moment remove the huge grief of me of"
15542,SECTION XXXIX.,"slender luck. But even if thou go (passing to-day here), I have, O"
15543,SECTION XXXIX.,"tiger-like monkey, doubts as to thy return; and, accordingly, doubt,"
15544,SECTION XXXIX.,"certainly, as to my life. And the grief incident to my not seeing thee"
15545,SECTION XXXIX.,"shall burn me greatly, even, O monkey, as grief burneth one that is"
15546,SECTION XXXIX.,"already consumed by sorrow over and over again. And, O hero, O lord of"
15547,SECTION XXXIX.,"monkeys, this doubt is also before me. How, alas! shall the mighty lord"
15548,SECTION XXXIX.,"of monkeys, albeit backed by the monkeys and bears, cross over the"
15549,SECTION XXXIX.,"mighty main hard to cross,—and (how shall) those forces consisting of"
15550,SECTION XXXIX.,bears and monkeys or those sons of the best of men (cross over the
15551,SECTION XXXIX.,"same)? In all the three worlds, Vinatā’s offspring, thyself, and the"
15552,SECTION XXXIX.,"Wind-god, have alone the power of crossing over the deep.—Then, for the"
15553,SECTION XXXIX.,"accomplishment of this work, difficult to compass, what, O hero, O thou"
15554,SECTION XXXIX.,"best of those conversant with business, what way dost thou see as to its"
15555,SECTION XXXIX.,"success? Or thou alone, O destroyer of hostile heroes, art quite enough"
15556,SECTION XXXIX.,"for the fulfilment of this purpose; and thou shalt reap, in the shape of"
15557,SECTION XXXIX.,"fame, the fruit of thy achievement. But if (Rāma) himself together with"
15558,SECTION XXXIX.,"all his forces, conquering Rāvana and (recovering me) in battle,"
15559,SECTION XXXIX.,"returned victorious to his own city,—this would be worthy of himself. If"
15560,SECTION XXXIX.,"blocking up Lankā with his army, that afflictor of hostile hosts,"
15561,SECTION XXXIX.,"Kākutstha took me (hence), that would be worthy of him. Do thou,"
15562,SECTION XXXIX.,"therefore, adopt such means that the high-souled heroic warrior may have"
15563,SECTION XXXIX.,an opportunity of putting forth prowess. Hearing those words fraught
15564,SECTION XXXIX.,"with sense and reason and informed with affection, Hanumān, by way of"
15565,SECTION XXXIX.,"reply said mildly,—""O revered lady, that foremost of monkeys—the lord of"
15566,SECTION XXXIX.,"bears and monkeys—Sugriva, possessed of truth, hath made up his mind on"
15567,SECTION XXXIX.,"thy behalf. That destroyer of Rākshasas, O daughter of Videha, environed"
15568,SECTION XXXIX.,"by thousands of millions of monkeys, will come hither without delay. And"
15569,SECTION XXXIX.,"exceedingly powerful and mighty monkeys possessed of prowess, and"
15570,SECTION XXXIX.,"speeding far with the rapidity of thought, are in his command. Nothing"
15571,SECTION XXXIX.,"can impede their courses, either upward, or downward, or tending in both"
15572,SECTION XXXIX.,directions; and those ones of measureless energy never experience
15573,SECTION XXXIX.,depression in the most arduous undertakings. Braced by their exalted
15574,SECTION XXXIX.,"spirits, these, resorting to the aerial way, have many a time and oft"
15575,SECTION XXXIX.,circumambulated the Earth containing mountains and meads. There are (in
15576,SECTION XXXIX.,"that army) rangers of woods, some equal and some superior to me. And"
15577,SECTION XXXIX.,near Sugriva there are none who are inferior to me. And since even I
15578,SECTION XXXIX.,"have reached this place, what shall I say of those ones endowed with"
15579,SECTION XXXIX.,immense might? Nor are superior (monkeys) sent on errands; it is only
15580,SECTION XXXIX.,"the inferior ones that are sent. Then, O exalted one, thou needst not"
15581,SECTION XXXIX.,grieve: let thy sorrow depart. Those leaders of monkey-herds will come
15582,SECTION XXXIX.,"to Lankā by one bound; and, like unto the risen Sun and Moon, those"
15583,SECTION XXXIX.,"leonine men, having large numbers to back them, will come to thy side,"
15584,SECTION XXXIX.,"riding my back. Those heroes and foremost of men, Rāma and Lakshmana"
15585,SECTION XXXIX.,"both, coming to the city of Lankā, shall destroy her by means of their"
15586,SECTION XXXIX.,"shafts. And slaying Rāvana together with his adherents, Raghu’s son,"
15587,SECTION XXXIX.,"taking thee, O paragon among women, shall return to his own city."
15588,SECTION XXXIX.,"Therefore, do thou take heart, good betide thee! Do thou remain, eagerly"
15589,SECTION XXXIX.,wishing for the time. It will not be long before thou shalt behold Rāma
15590,SECTION XXXIX.,resembling flaming fire. On the lord of Rākshasas being slain along with
15591,SECTION XXXIX.,"his counsellors and friends, thou shalt meet with Rāma, even as Rohini"
15592,SECTION XXXIX.,"meeteth with the Moon. O worshipful one, speedily shalt thou behold the"
15593,SECTION XXXIX.,"other shore of thy misery, O Maithili; and thou shalt see Rāvana slain"
15594,SECTION XXXIX.,"by Rāma by might of arm."" Having thus solaced Videha’s daughter,"
15595,SECTION XXXIX.,"Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god, again spoke unto Vaidehi, saying,—""Soon"
15596,SECTION XXXIX.,"shalt thou behold that destroyer of foes, Rāghava of subdued soul, and"
15597,SECTION XXXIX.,"the bow-bearing Lakshmana also, come to the gate of Lankā. And soon"
15598,SECTION XXXIX.,"shalt thou behold the assembled heroic monkeys, endowed with the prowess"
15599,SECTION XXXIX.,"of lions and tigers, and the splendour of the monarch of monkeys, and"
15600,SECTION XXXIX.,"having nails and teeth for their arms. And thou shalt, O noble one,"
15601,SECTION XXXIX.,"behold innumerable companies of choice monkeys, resembling hills and"
15602,SECTION XXXIX.,"clouds,—roaring on the plateaus of Malaya in Lankā."
15603,SECTION XXXIX.,
15604,SECTION XXXIX.,"Like an elephant tormented by a lion, Rāma afflicted in the vitals by"

15607,SECTION XXXIX.,"as Sachi meeteth with Sakra, shalt thou, O auspicious one, meet with thy"
15608,SECTION XXXIX.,lord. Who is greater than Rāma? And who is equal to Sanmitri?³⁶⁴ And
15609,SECTION XXXIX.,"these brothers resembling Fire and the Wind, are thy help. O revered"
15610,SECTION XXXIX.,"one, thou wilt not have to dwell long in this extremely dreadful place"
15611,SECTION XXXIX.,inhabited by the Rākshasas. The arrival of thy beloved one is not

15631,SECTION XL.,"onto Rāma, and tell him also for a sign that he had in ire buried the"
15632,SECTION XL.,"dart which destroyed a single eye of the crow. And tell him also,³⁶⁵—’On"

15644,SECTION XL.,"not live. This Rākshasa king is dreadful. (This being so), if I hear"

15646,SECTION XL.,"pathetic and uttered with tears, the highly energetic Hanumān, son unto"
15647,SECTION XL.,"the Wind-god, said,—""My revered one, I swear unto thee by truth itself"
15648,SECTION XL.,that Rāma neglecteth every business because of grief for thee. And Rāma

15707,SECTION XLI.,"resembling Nandana itself, containing various trees and plants, and"
15708,SECTION XLI.,"captivating to eye and heart,—will I destroy; even as fire destroyeth a"

15710,SECTION XLI.,"the Rākshasa monarch shall summon up an army consisting of horses,"
15711,SECTION XLI.,"elephants, and mighty cars, equipped with tridents, iron axes and other"

15797,SECTION XLII.,"affluent with elegant foliage, under which Sitā herself hath (always"
15798,SECTION XLII.,"rested), hath been spared by him. It behoveth thee to order sharp"
15799,SECTION XLII.,"chastisement to be inflicted on that one of a fierce form, who, having"
15800,SECTION XLII.,"carried on converse with Sitā, hath laid thy wood waste. Who, O"
15801,SECTION XLII.,"Sovereign of the Rākshasas,that hath not his life severed from"
15802,SECTION XLII.,"him,—converseth with Sitā, who hath captivated thy heart?"" Hearing the"
15803,SECTION XLII.,"speeches of the Rākshasis, Rāvana, lord of Rākshasas, with his eyes"
15804,SECTION XLII.,"rolling in rage, flamed up like the fire of a funeral pyre. And as fall"
15805,SECTION XLII.,"drops of lighted oil from a flaming lamp,fell drops of tears from the"
15806,SECTION XLII.,eyes of the enraged Rāvana. And that highly energetic one ordered his
15807,SECTION XLII.,"heroic servants, resembling himself, to punish Hanumān. And from that"
15808,SECTION XLII.,"mansion speedily issued eighty thousand of those retainers, carrying in"
15809,SECTION XLII.,"their hands maces and mallets³⁷⁰,—having huge bellies, and large teeth,"
15810,SECTION XLII.,"of dreadful forms, and possessed of unwieldy strength,—all eager to"
15811,SECTION XLII.,engage in the conflict and take Hanumān. And having come near that
15812,SECTION XLII.,"monkey staying at the main entrance, those swelling spirits rushed on,"
15813,SECTION XLII.,"even as insects rush into a flame. And equipped with variegated maces,"
15814,SECTION XLII.,"and bludgeons, and golden _angadas_,³⁷¹ and arrows resembling the Sun,"
15815,SECTION XLII.,"they approached that foremost of monkeys. And accoutred in maces, axes,"
15816,SECTION XLII.,"and javelins, and bearing bearded darts and lances in their hands, they"
15817,SECTION XLII.,suddeuly surrounded Hanumān and remained before him. And the graceful
15818,SECTION XLII.,"and energetic Hanumān also, resembling a hill, flourishing his tail over"
15819,SECTION XLII.,"the ground, sent up tremendous roars. And attaining mighty proportions,"
15820,SECTION XLII.,"Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god, brandished his tail, filling Lankā with"
15821,SECTION XLII.,"sounds. And at the sounds of his flourishing, as well as with those"
15822,SECTION XLII.,"resounding ones set up by himself, birds began to drop down from the"
15823,SECTION XLII.,"sky. And he loudly proclaimed,—""Victory to the exceedingly strong Rāma"
15824,SECTION XLII.,"and to the mighty Lakshmana! And victory unto king Sugriva, protected of"
15825,SECTION XLII.,"Rāghava! I am the servant of the Sovereign of Kerala, Rāma of untiring"
15826,SECTION XLII.,"deeds,— (I am) Hanumān, the destroyer of hostile hosts, offspring of the"
15827,SECTION XLII.,"Wind-god. And a thousand Rāvanas cannot cope with me in conflict, when I"
15828,SECTION XLII.,shall hurl crags and trees by thousands. In the very presence of all the
15829,SECTION XLII.,"Rakshas, shall I, having desolated the city of Lankā and paid my"
15830,SECTION XLII.,"reverence to Maithili, go away, my end being compassed."" They were"
15831,SECTION XLII.,struck with affright at his roars; and they beheld Hanumān elevated as
15832,SECTION XLII.,an evening cloud. And now knowing for certain that the monkey had been
15833,SECTION XLII.,"despatched by his master, the Rākshasas commenced assailing him with"
15834,SECTION XLII.,"various kinds of dire arms.³⁷² Environed on all sides by those heroes,"
15835,SECTION XLII.,"that exceedingly powerful one, staying by the main entrance, took up a"
15836,SECTION XLII.,"terrific bolt. And taking that bolt, like Vinatā’s offspring handling a"
15837,SECTION XLII.,"darting serpent, he slew those rangers of the night. And grasping (the"
15838,SECTION XLII.,"bolt), the Wind-god’s son began to range the welkin and destroy (the"
15839,SECTION XLII.,"Rākshasas), like the thousand-eyed (deity) slaughtering Daityas with his"
15840,SECTION XLII.,"thunder-bolt. And having slain those Rākshasas, who were the retainers"
15841,SECTION XLII.,"of Rāvana, the heroic offspring of the Wind-god—foremost of"
15842,SECTION XLII.,"heroes—desirous of fight, stood at the gate. Then certain Rākshasas,"
15843,SECTION XLII.,"getting off from the field in fear, informed Rāvana of the destruction"
15844,SECTION XLII.,of all his servants. Hearing that a mighty host of the Rākshasas had
15845,SECTION XLII.,"been slain, the king, with his eyes whirling in ire, ordered Prahasta’s"

15865,SECTION XLIII.,"day will I demolish this structure."" Having thought thus in his heart,"
15866,SECTION XLIII.,"that foremost of monkeys, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god, displaying his"
15867,SECTION XLIII.,"strength, bounded unto the Chaitya³⁷³ building, elevated like a summit"
15868,SECTION XLIII.,"of Meru. And having ascended the edifice resembling a mountain, that"
15869,SECTION XLIII.,"leader of monkey-bands, possessed of wondrous energy, looked like"
15870,SECTION XLIII.,another Sun risen (in the sky). And having broken down that superb
15871,SECTION XLIII.,"edifice, the irrepressible Hanumān, flaming in auspicionsness, resembled"
15872,SECTION XLIII.,(the mountain) Pariyātra. And magnifying his dimensions through his
15873,SECTION XLIII.,"energy, the offspring of the Wind-god fearlessly fell to striking his"
15874,SECTION XLIII.,"arms with his hands, and thus filling Lankā, with the sounds. And at"
15875,SECTION XLIII.,"those sounds of striking arms, capable of striking deafness into the"
15876,SECTION XLIII.,"hearer, birds began to drop down there, as well as the warders of the"
15877,SECTION XLIII.,"religious mansion, with their senses overwhelmed. ""Victory unto Rāma"
15878,SECTION XLIII.,versed in arms! And unto Lakshmana endowed with immense strength! And
15879,SECTION XLIII.,"victory unto king Sugriva, who is protected by Rāghava! Hanumān, son"
15880,SECTION XLIII.,"onto the Wind-god, destroyer of hostile hosts, is the slave of Rāma of"
15881,SECTION XLIII.,untiring deeds. And not a thousand Rāvanas can cope with me in conflict
15882,SECTION XLIII.,as I hurl stones and trees by thousands. Having destroyed the city of
15883,SECTION XLIII.,"Lankā and paid my respects to Mithilā’s daughter, I, my object gained,"
15884,SECTION XLIII.,"shall depart in the presence of all the Rākshasas."" Having spoken thus,"
15885,SECTION XLIII.,"that one of a prodigious person, seated on the _Chaitya_, emitted"
15886,SECTION XLIII.,"tremendous roars, striking terror into the Rakshas. In consequence of"
15887,SECTION XLIII.,"that mighty cry, an hundred guards attached to the _Chaitya_ sallied"
15888,SECTION XLIII.,"out, taking various weapons—bearded darts, scimitars and axes; and they"
15889,SECTION XLIII.,"surrounded the Wind-god’s offspring, as he went on increasing his body."
15890,SECTION XLIII.,"And they encountered that foremost of monkeys with various maces, and"

15895,SECTION XLIII.,"piller of the edifice, plated with gold, and having an hundred borders,"
15896,SECTION XLIII.,"began to whirl it (in the air).³⁷⁵ And the fire generated there thus,"

15899,SECTION XLIII.,"slaying Asuras with his thunderbolt,—remaining in the sky,"

15950,SECTION XLIV.,"Hanumān of terrific prowess, uprooting a large _sāla_, began to whirl it"

16050,SECTION XLVI.,"intelligence, nor their strength, nor their courage, nor their capacity"
16051,SECTION XLVI.,to change shapes. Therefore ye should know him as some great being
16052,SECTION XLVI.,"staying in the form of a monkey. Exerting yourself to the uttermost, do"
16053,SECTION XLVI.,"ye chastise him. These three worlds combined, with Indra, celestials and"
16054,SECTION XLVI.,"mortals, are incapable of long staying before you in the field of"
16055,SECTION XLVI.,"battle. Still a person versed in polity, albeit anxious to secure"
16056,SECTION XLVI.,"victory in battle, should carefully preserve self, as success in war is"
16057,SECTION XLVI.,"unstable."" Thereupon, they, possessed of the energy of fire, accepting"
16058,SECTION XLVI.,"the words of their master,rushed forth vehemently, accompanied with"
16059,SECTION XLVI.,"cars, mad elephants, fleet steeds, sharp and whetted weapons,—and forces"
16060,SECTION XLVI.,"of all kinds. Then those heroes saw that effulgent mighty monkey,"
16061,SECTION XLVI.,"shining in his native splendour, like unto the risen sun,— possessed of"
16062,SECTION XLVI.,"great strength and immense speed, and magnanimity of mind,—seated at the"
16063,SECTION XLVI.,"gate. And soon as they saw him, they, frightened at his appearance,"
16064,SECTION XLVI.,assailed him with their respective terrible weapons. And Durdhasa
16065,SECTION XLVI.,discharged at Hanumān’s head five white iron³⁸² arrows with yellow
16066,SECTION XLVI.,"heads, and possessing the lustre of lotus-leaves. Having been pierced in"
16067,SECTION XLVI.,"the head with those shafts, the monkey, roaring, leapt into the sky,"
16068,SECTION XLVI.,making the ten cardinal points resound. Then the exceedingly powerful
16069,SECTION XLVI.,"and heroic Durdhara, mounted on a car, with his bow stringed, came"
16070,SECTION XLVI.,"forward, showering innumerable arrows by hundreds. Thereat, even as the"
16071,SECTION XLVI.,"wind driveth away rain-pouring clouds at the end of the rainy season,"
16072,SECTION XLVI.,"the monkey, remaining in the sky, resisted (his antagonist) as he kept"
16073,SECTION XLVI.,"on pouring his shafts. And sore beset by Durdhara, the Wind-god’s son"
16074,SECTION XLVI.,"again emitted cries, and that puissant one also increased himself. Then"
16075,SECTION XLVI.,"darting far up in the air, the monkey suddenly descended on the car of"
16076,SECTION XLVI.,"Durdhara with extreme vehemence, like unto a mass of lightning alighting"
16077,SECTION XLVI.,"on a mountain.—Thereat his eight steeds getting mangled, and the wheels"
16078,SECTION XLVI.,"and pole of his car having been broken, Durdhara leaving the car, fell"
16079,SECTION XLVI.,"down to the earth, deprived of life. Seeing him down on the earth, those"
16080,SECTION XLVI.,"irrepressible subduers of enemies, Virupāksha and Yupāksha, waxing"
16081,SECTION XLVI.,"wroth, sprang up. And springing up suddenly, they by means of maces,"
16082,SECTION XLVI.,"dealt blows on the chest of the monkey, who was staying in the unclouded"
16083,SECTION XLVI.,sky. Thereat resisting the furious rush of those gifted with ebullient
16084,SECTION XLVI.,"energy, that exceedingly powerful one descended to the earth with the"
16085,SECTION XLVI.,violence of the Fair-feathered (bird).³⁸³ Then getting at and uprooting
16086,SECTION XLVI.,"a _sāla_ tree, that monkey, the Wind-god’s offspring, slew both of those"
16087,SECTION XLVI.,heroic Rākshasas. Learning that those three had been slain by the monkey
16088,SECTION XLVI.,"gifted with speed, the mighty and onrushing Praghasa laughing in scorn"
16089,SECTION XLVI.,advanced (in the encounter). And the energetic Bhāsakarna also came
16090,SECTION XLVI.,"forward in rage, taking a dart. And (they) meeting together, Praghasa"
16091,SECTION XLVI.,"assailed the famous, tiger-like monkey with a sharp-edged axe, and"
16092,SECTION XLVI.,Bhāsakarna (attacked) the elephantine monkey with a javelin. And with
16093,SECTION XLVI.,"his limbs wounded by them, and his hair wetted with blood, that monkey"
16094,SECTION XLVI.,"resembling in splendour the infant sun, grew furiously enraged. And that"
16095,SECTION XLVI.,"elephantine monkey, the heroic Hanumān, uprooting a mountain-peak, with"
16096,SECTION XLVI.,"beasts, snakes, and trees (in it), slew those Rākshasas; and, crushed by"
16097,SECTION XLVI.,"that mountain-summit, they were reduced to powder. On those five"
16098,SECTION XLVI.,"generals having fallen, the monkey slew the remaining forces. And as the"
16099,SECTION XLVI.,"thousand-eyed Deity destroyed Asuras, the monkey destroyed steeds with"
16100,SECTION XLVI.,"steeds, elephants with elephants, warriors with warriors, and cars with"
16101,SECTION XLVI.,"cars. And with horses and elephants, swift steeds, with broken wheels"
16102,SECTION XLVI.,"and mighty cars, and Rākshasas slain, all the ways were blocked up. And"
16103,SECTION XLVI.,having destroyed in battle the heroic generals with all their forces and
16104,SECTION XLVI.,"vehicles, that hero in the same way rested at the gate like Kāla himself"
16105,SECTION XLVI.,"engaged in destroying people, when he hath gained respite."

16120,SECTION XLVII.,Hearing that the five generals had been slain by Hanumān alone with
16121,SECTION XLVII.,"their vehicles and followers, the king, gazing at prince Aksha, who was"
16122,SECTION XLVII.,"ready and eager to go to battle, commanded him to take the field. And"
16123,SECTION XLVII.,"that puissant one of a bow decked with gold, on being commanded (by"
16124,SECTION XLVII.,"Rāvana) with a glance, started up, like unto fire on being fed by"
16125,SECTION XLVII.,clarified butter by foremost regenerate persons on the sacrificial
16126,SECTION XLVII.,"ground. And that best of Nairitas³⁸⁴ possessed of prowess, ascending a"
16127,SECTION XLVII.,"car resembling the infant sun in effulgence, and surrounded all round"
16128,SECTION XLVII.,"with networks of burnished gold, sallied forth in quest of that mighty"
16129,SECTION XLVII.,"monkey. And (that warrior) in prowess resembling an immortal, sallied"
16130,SECTION XLVII.,"out ascending that car, obtained with long-contianed asceticism,"
16131,SECTION XLVII.,"embellished with a network of glowing gold, furnished with pennons,"
16132,SECTION XLVII.,"having a standard studded with gems, nicely yoked with eight excellent"
16133,SECTION XLVII.,"steeds having the fleetness of thought, incapable of being overpowered"
16134,SECTION XLVII.,"either by celestials or Asuras, competent to course over uneven ground,"
16135,SECTION XLVII.,"of the lustre of lightning, sky-ranging, completely garnished, equipped"
16136,SECTION XLVII.,"with quivers, with swords fastened to the banners in eight directions,"
16137,SECTION XLVII.,"with darts and lances arranged in proper places, splendid with every"
16138,SECTION XLVII.,"object in full measure, bearing golden threads, wearing the brilliancy"
16139,SECTION XLVII.,"of the sun and moon, and possessing the effulgence of the sun. And"
16140,SECTION XLVII.,filling the firmament and the earth containing mountains with sounds
16141,SECTION XLVII.,"proceeding from steeds, elephants and mighty cars,—he, accompanied by"
16142,SECTION XLVII.,"his forces, presented himself before the capable monkey, who was seated"
16143,SECTION XLVII.,"at the gate. And coming before the monkey, Aksha, having the gaze of a"
16144,SECTION XLVII.,"lion,with eyes betokening regard, gazed at Hanumān resembling the Fire"
16145,SECTION XLVII.,"on the occassion of the universal dissolution at the end of a _yuga_,"
16146,SECTION XLVII.,"intent on destroying creatures, and who was seated and was influenced"
16147,SECTION XLVII.,alike by surprise and regard. And seriously considering the impetuosity
16148,SECTION XLVII.,of the high-souled monkey as well as his prowess in relation to a
16149,SECTION XLVII.,"foe,—as also his own strength, he increased (in strength) like the Sun"
16150,SECTION XLVII.,"on the expiration of a Yuga. And growing enraged, (Aksha), staying"
16151,SECTION XLVII.,"calmly in the field, with concentrated soul, challenged Hanumān"
16152,SECTION XLVII.,"difficult to resist in conflict and of prowess worthy to witness, with"
16153,SECTION XLVII.,"three whetted shafts. And finding the monkey proud and untiring, capable"
16154,SECTION XLVII.,"of vanquishing his foe, and possessed of exalted spirits, Aksha took up"
16155,SECTION XLVII.,"his bow and held his arrows in his hands. And wearing a golden corslet,"
16156,SECTION XLVII.,"_angadas_, and earings, and possessed of fiery vigor, he closed with the"
16157,SECTION XLVII.,"monkey; and their meeting was something unparalleled on this earth,—and"
16158,SECTION XLVII.,was calculated to raise the respect³⁸⁵ even of the celestials and the
16159,SECTION XLVII.,"Asuras. And witnessing the mighty conflict of the prince and the monkey,"
16160,SECTION XLVII.,"Earth emitted cries, and the Sun did not burn, and the Wind did not"
16161,SECTION XLVII.,"blow, and the mountains shook, and the welkin sounded, and the main was"
16162,SECTION XLVII.,"vexed. And that hero, skilled in aiming, fixing and discharging arrows,"
16163,SECTION XLVII.,shot at the monkey’s head three fine-headed feathered shafts plated with
16164,SECTION XLVII.,"gold near the feathers, and resembling venomous serpents. And with his"
16165,SECTION XLVII.,rolling eyes washed with blood in consequence of the shafts having
16166,SECTION XLVII.,"alighted at his head, Hanumān, resembling a new-risen Sun having arrows"
16167,SECTION XLVII.,"for its rays, looked splendid like the light-engarlanded Sun. And seeing"
16168,SECTION XLVII.,"in battle that son of the foremost of monarchs, with his excellent"
16169,SECTION XLVII.,"weapons upraised and his beautiful bow, that best of the counsellors of"
16170,SECTION XLVII.,"the lord of monkeys, rejoiced, and intent on encounter, increased"
16171,SECTION XLVII.,"himself. And with his ire heightened, that one endowed with energy and"
16172,SECTION XLVII.,"prowess, like unto the ray-decorated (Sun) on the crest of Mandara,³⁸⁶"
16173,SECTION XLVII.,"began to burn with the fiery rays of his eyes, Aksha, along with his"
16174,SECTION XLVII.,forces and vehicles. And as a mass of clouds showereth rain on a high
16175,SECTION XLVII.,"hill, the arrow-showering Rākshasa resembling clouds, having the bow for"
16176,SECTION XLVII.,"his rain-bow, discharged shafts at that foremost of monkeys,"
16177,SECTION XLVII.,"representing a mountain. And then the monkey, having sounds like those"
16178,SECTION XLVII.,"of clouds, beholding in battle Aksha of terrific prowess in conflict,"
16179,SECTION XLVII.,"and strong in energy, strength and shafts, sent up shouts from elation"
16180,SECTION XLVII.,of spirits. And as an elephant approacheth a deep pit covered over with
16181,SECTION XLVII.,"grass, (Aksha) from a spirit of childishness elated in conflict with his"
16182,SECTION XLVII.,"prowess, with his ire heightened, and eyes resembling blood, drew near"
16183,SECTION XLVII.,"the monkey in the field. And as Aksha went on hastily pouring shafts,"
16184,SECTION XLVII.,"that one uttering roars resembling the rumbling of clouds, looking"
16185,SECTION XLVII.,"terrible in consequence of his arms and thighs flung about, darted into"
16186,SECTION XLVII.,"the sky with exhuberant energy. And as he leapt up, that strong and"
16187,SECTION XLVII.,powerful one—foremost of Rākshasas—that car-warrior and the best of
16188,SECTION XLVII.,"choice car-warriors—rushed at (Hanumān), showering arrows on him, like a"
16189,SECTION XLVII.,cloud showering hail-stones on a mountain. And dashing in the midst of
16190,SECTION XLVII.,"the arrows like the wind, and thus baffling them, the heroic monkey of"
16191,SECTION XLVII.,"dreadful prowess in conflict, and endowed with the speed of thought,"
16192,SECTION XLVII.,began to range the path of the air. And witnessing Aksha with regardful
16193,SECTION XLVII.,"eyes, as that one intent on contest, taking his bow, was covering the"
16194,SECTION XLVII.,"sky with various excellent arrows, the Wind-god’s offspring was plunged"
16195,SECTION XLVII.,"in thought. Wounded in the arm with shafts by that high-souled, noble"
16196,SECTION XLVII.,"prince, that mighty-armed one, capable of adequately appreciating the"
16197,SECTION XLVII.,"nature of actions, thought on (Aksha’s) prowess in battle. ""This"
16198,SECTION XLVII.,"exceedingly powerful one, endowed with the splendour of the infant sun,"
16199,SECTION XLVII.,is doing dire deeds incapable of being done by a boy; and I am loth to
16200,SECTION XLVII.,slay one that hath shown himself equal to every martial feat. This one
16201,SECTION XLVII.,"is high-souled, mighty in energy, of concentrated self, and capable of"
16202,SECTION XLVII.,"bearing extreme hardships in war; without doubt, by virtue of his"
16203,SECTION XLVII.,"actions, he is worthy of being honored by Nāgas, Yakshas and ascetics."
16204,SECTION XLVII.,"With his mind braced by prowess and hope, that foremost of heroes eyeth"
16205,SECTION XLVII.,"me staying in the fore-front. The prowess of this light-handed (one), I"
16206,SECTION XLVII.,"ween, maketh even the hearts of the celestials and Asuras tremble. If I"
16207,SECTION XLVII.,"disregard him, he shall certainly vanquish me, for his prowess in battle"
16208,SECTION XLVII.,increaseth (fast). Therefore I must even slay him: it is not proper to
16209,SECTION XLVII.,"suffer an increasing fire."" Thus reflecting on the strength of his foe"
16210,SECTION XLVII.,"and having ascertained his line of action, that puissant one endowed"
16211,SECTION XLVII.,"with great strength, summoned energy and set his heart on slaying him"
16212,SECTION XLVII.,"(his antagonist). And remaining in the path coursed by the air, that"
16213,SECTION XLVII.,"heroic monkey, the offspring of the Wind-god, with his slaps slew his"
16214,SECTION XLVII.,"eight powerful and excellent steeds, capable of bearing pressure and"
16215,SECTION XLVII.,trained to diverse circular movements. And successfully assailed by the
16216,SECTION XLVII.,"councilor of that lord of monkeys, the car with its seat smashed, and"
16217,SECTION XLVII.,"its pole broken, and deprived of its steeds, fell to the earth from the"
16218,SECTION XLVII.,"sky. Thereat, forsaking that car, the mighty car-warrior sprang up into"
16219,SECTION XLVII.,"sky with his bow and holding his sabre,—and (resembled) an ascetic of"
16220,SECTION XLVII.,"fierce energy consequent on austerities, going up to heaven, renouncing"
16221,SECTION XLVII.,"his body. Then the monkey possessed of the energy and vigor of the Wind,"
16222,SECTION XLVII.,"approaching him as he was ranging the air coursed by the king of birds,"
16223,SECTION XLVII.,"the Wind and the Siddhas, at length fast caught hold of his legs. And as"
16224,SECTION XLVII.,"the foremost of birds, Garuda taking a mighty serpent, whirls it, that"
16225,SECTION XLVII.,"foremost of monkeys, resembling his sire in prowess, whirling Aksha in"
16226,SECTION XLVII.,"the conflict, violently dropped him on the earth. And with his arms,"
16227,SECTION XLVII.,"thighs and chest crushed, bleeding, (having his bones and eyes smashed,"
16228,SECTION XLVII.,"his joints riven, and his tendons snapped, the Rākshasa lay on the"
16229,SECTION XLVII.,"earth, slain by the offspring of the Wind-god. And tormenting him"
16230,SECTION XLVII.,"(Aksha) on the earth, that mighty monkey caused great fright unto the"
16231,SECTION XLVII.,ruler of the Rākshasas; and he was gazed at by the assembled Maharshis
16232,SECTION XLVII.,"and the orbit-coursing ones and all beings with Yakshas and Pannagas,"
16233,SECTION XLVII.,"come to see him. And on the prince being slain, that monkey was gazed at"
16234,SECTION XLVII.,"by the celestials with Indra, who had been seized with extreme"
16235,SECTION XLVII.,wonderment. And having slain in battle prince Aksha resembling a son of
16236,SECTION XLVII.,"the celestials and possessed of blood-red eyes, the hero (again) neared"
16237,SECTION XLVII.,"the same gate, and waited there like _Kāla_ bent upon destroying all"

16299,SECTION XLVIII.,"Hearing the words of his father, (Indrajit) gifted with celestial"

16306,SECTION XLVIII.,"the lord of the celestials, ascended a car drawn by four horses, having"
16307,SECTION XLVIII.,sharpened teeth and resembling Garuda in velocity. And that master of a
16308,SECTION XLVIII.,"car and foremost of bowmen, conversant with the use of all weapons —the"
16309,SECTION XLVIII.,best of those using swords—proceeded soon in his car where Hanumān was.
16310,SECTION XLVIII.,"And hearing the sound of his car and the twang of his bow, that heroic"
16311,SECTION XLVIII.,monkey attained an excess of delight. And taking up a bow and sharpened

16313,SECTION XLVIII.,"And as he issued out for battle, greatly delighted, with arrows in his"
16314,SECTION XLVIII.,"hands, all the quarters became dark, and jackals began to set up"

16316,SECTION XLVIII.,"_Maharshis_, the planets, and the Siddhas, and the birds, covering the"
16317,SECTION XLVIII.,"welkin, and, greatly delighted, began to make a noise. And beholding"
16318,SECTION XLVIII.,"that car having a flag like that of Indra, approach very quickly, the"
16319,SECTION XLVIII.,monkey began to emit terrible roars and increase himself. And Indrajit
16320,SECTION XLVIII.,"too, seated on the celestial car and having a painted bow, began to"
16321,SECTION XLVIII.,"stretch it, emitting a sound resembling that of thunder. Thereupon"
16322,SECTION XLVIII.,closed in conflict those two greatly powerful (heroes)—gifted with swift
16323,SECTION XLVIII.,"movements and fearless in battle—the monkey, and the son of the lord of"
16324,SECTION XLVIII.,"Rākshasas, like unto the lords of celestials and Asuras. And baffling"
16325,SECTION XLVIII.,"the shafts of that hero of a mighty car, an accomplished bowman and a"
16326,SECTION XLVIII.,"finished warrior, the immeasurably powerful monkey increasing himself"
16327,SECTION XLVIII.,began to range in the welkin.³⁹⁴ Thereupon the heroic (Indrajit)—slayer
16328,SECTION XLVIII.,"of foes—began to discharge incessantly shafts, large, sharp,"
16329,SECTION XLVIII.,"well-feathered, painted in gold and swift-coursing like unto thunder."
16330,SECTION XLVIII.,"And hearing again the noise of his car, the sounds of drums, bugles, and"
16331,SECTION XLVIII.,"war-drums, and the twangs of the bow, he again leaped up (in the sky)."
16332,SECTION XLVIII.,"And baffling the aim of (Indrajit), who had always an eye on it, that"
16333,SECTION XLVIII.,great monkey ranged at a distance from those shafts. And again facing
16334,SECTION XLVIII.,"the arrows and stretching his hands, the Wind-god’s son again leaped up."
16335,SECTION XLVIII.,"And those two heroes,gifted with swift movements and versed in the art"
16336,SECTION XLVIII.,"of war, engaged in a combat, admired of all beings. And Hanumān could"
16337,SECTION XLVIII.,"not find out the short-comings of the Rākshasa, nor could that"
16338,SECTION XLVIII.,high-souled one detect the weak points of the son of the Wind-god. And
16339,SECTION XLVIII.,"these two gifted with celestial prowess, engaged in conflict, became"
16340,SECTION XLVIII.,unbearable unto each other. And seeing him unhurt though aimed at with
16341,SECTION XLVIII.,"infallible arrows, the high-souled (Indrajit), controlling his senses,"
16342,SECTION XLVIII.,engaged in deep and devout meditation³⁹⁵ (to realize the true identity
16343,SECTION XLVIII.,"of Hanumān). Thereupon, that son of the lord of Rākshasas pinned his"
16344,SECTION XLVIII.,"thoughts upon that foremost of monkeys, and, finding him incapable of"
16345,SECTION XLVIII.,"being slain, he began to devise plans how he could be bound. And that"
16346,SECTION XLVIII.,"hero, foremost of those versed in the use of weapons, discharged at that"
16347,SECTION XLVIII.,"best of monkeys the highly powerful weapon conferred on him by Brahmā,"
16348,SECTION XLVIII.,the Great-father of the celestials. And knowing him incapable of being
16349,SECTION XLVIII.,"slain, Indrajit conversant with the use of weapons, bound that"
16350,SECTION XLVIII.,large-armed son of the Wind-god with that weapon. And being bound up by
16351,SECTION XLVIII.,"that Rākshasa with the weapon, the monkey became motionless and fell"
16352,SECTION XLVIII.,down on the earth. And thinking that he was bound up with a Brahmā
16353,SECTION XLVIII.,"weapon, he did not feel the least pain in consequence of Brahmā’s"
16354,SECTION XLVIII.,blessing. And that heroic monkey began to think of the boons conferred
16355,SECTION XLVIII.,on him by the Great-father of the celestials. And thinking that the
16356,SECTION XLVIII.,weapon was conferred by the Self-create and consecrated by sacred
16357,SECTION XLVIII.,"Mantras, Hanumān began to think of boons conferred by the Great-father."
16358,SECTION XLVIII.,"""In consequence of the power of the Lord of creation I am incapable of"
16359,SECTION XLVIII.,"extricating myself from these bonds."" (Knowing this by means of devout"
16360,SECTION XLVIII.,"meditation,he reflected again,)—""This has been ordained by Him, and I"
16361,SECTION XLVIII.,"must put up with this pain for sometime."" Revolving well the power of"
16362,SECTION XLVIII.,"the weapon, the boon of the Great-father, and his own prowess to"
16363,SECTION XLVIII.,"extricate himself from the bonds, the monkey followed the Great-father’s"
16364,SECTION XLVIII.,"behest,—""I do not fear though bound by this weapon, since I am being"
16365,SECTION XLVIII.,"protected by Brahmā, Indra and the Wind-god. It will be better if I am"
16366,SECTION XLVIII.,"carried off by the Rākshasas, for I shall reap very great benefit by my"
16367,SECTION XLVIII.,conversation with the lord of Rākshasas. Therefore let the enemies carry
16368,SECTION XLVIII.,"me."" Having resolved this, the considerate (monkey)—slayer of"
16369,SECTION XLVIII.,foes—remained motionless. And being ruthlessly bound by the foes and
16370,SECTION XLVIII.,"remonstrated with by them, he began to moan piteously. And beholding"
16371,SECTION XLVIII.,"that slayer of foes motionless, the Rākshasas bound him up with cotton"
16372,SECTION XLVIII.,and bark. And he gladly allowed himself to be tied up and rebuked by his
16373,SECTION XLVIII.,"enemies, thinking that he might converse with the lord of the Rākshasas,"
16374,SECTION XLVIII.,"if he, out of curiosity, should like to see him. Being bound with bark,"
16375,SECTION XLVIII.,"that powerful (monkey) got himself freed from the binding of the weapon,"

16379,SECTION XLVIII.,binding force of the Brahmā weapon became powerless when there was any
16380,SECTION XLVIII.,"other binding. ""Alas, (those Rakshas) have rendered my mighty deed"
16381,SECTION XLVIII.,fruitless. They know not the action of Mantras.³⁹⁶ And on the Brahma

16383,SECTION XLVIII.,"we have all been placed in a critical predicament."" On being released"
16384,SECTION XLVIII.,"from the weapon, Hanumān did not betray any signs of his liberation,"
16385,SECTION XLVIII.,albeit he was pulled by the Rākshasas and pained by the bonds they had
16386,SECTION XLVIII.,"bound him with. And the monkey, Hanumān, was pulled by those cruel"

16388,SECTION XLVIII.,And seeing (Hanumān) freed from the (Brahmā) weapon yet bound by the

16391,SECTION XLVIII.,related unto the ruler of Rakshas everything touching that foremost of
16392,SECTION XLVIII.,"choice monkeys, resembling a mad elephant who was in bonds. ""Who is he?"
16393,SECTION XLVIII.,And whose son? And wherefrom? And what’s his errand? And by whom is he
16394,SECTION XLVIII.,"backed?""—thus did the heroic Rākshasas converse on beholding Hanumān."
16395,SECTION XLVIII.,"And others said,—""Kill him,"" ""Burn him""—""Eat him up."" The Rākshasas,"
16396,SECTION XLVIII.,"growing enraged, thus said unto each other.—Having passed some way, that"
16397,SECTION XLVIII.,magnanimous one saw there old servants sitting at the feet of the lord
16398,SECTION XLVIII.,"of Rākshasas,—as well as a mansion embellished with countless jewels."
16399,SECTION XLVIII.,And the exceedingly energetic Rāvana saw that foremost of monkeys
16400,SECTION XLVIII.,dragged hither and thither by Rākshasas of frightful forms. And that
16401,SECTION XLVIII.,"best of monkeys too saw that lord of Rākshasas, endowed with strength"
16402,SECTION XLVIII.,and energy and resembling the resplendent son. And with his reddened

16681,SECTION LII.,"consider what is proper or otherwise, and then do thou mete out"
16682,SECTION LII.,"punishment to the envoy."" Hearing Vibhishana’s speech, Rāvana lord of"
16683,SECTION LII.,"Rākshasas, overcome with a mighty wrath, answered,—""O slayer of foes, to"
16684,SECTION LII.,"slay the sinful doth not cause sin. Therefore shall I slay this monkey,"
16685,SECTION LII.,"worker of iniquity."" Hearing these words grounded in unrighteousness,"
16686,SECTION LII.,"evil every way, and worthy of the base, that foremost of intelligent"
16687,SECTION LII.,"ones, Vibhishana, spoke words couching supreme import,—""O lord of Lankā,"
16688,SECTION LII.,"be propitious. O Sovereign of Rākshasas, listen to speech containing the"
16689,SECTION LII.,"significance of virtue and profit. O king, an envoy is not to be put to"
16690,SECTION LII.,death on the occasion of his discharging his proper functions. This
16691,SECTION LII.,righteous people say everywhere unto all. Surely this is an overgrown
16692,SECTION LII.,enemy; and he hath perpetrated immense injury (unto us). But say the
16693,SECTION LII.,"good, envoys are not to be slain, albeit many are the punishments that"
16694,SECTION LII.,"have been assigned for messengers. Disfigurement of the body, stripes,"
16695,SECTION LII.,"shaving of the head,—one of these or all combined,—these are said to be"
16696,SECTION LII.,the punishments that should be inflicted on envoys. But I have not heard
16697,SECTION LII.,of the punishment of death being a penalty of the envoy. Why doth one
16698,SECTION LII.,"like thee, having one’s intelligence rendered meek as respects"
16699,SECTION LII.,"righteousness and profit, and capable of proceeding on certain decisions"
16700,SECTION LII.,"on the merits or otherwise of things,—come under the sway of passion?"
16701,SECTION LII.,Those possessed of power never give way to anger. Neither in religious
16702,SECTION LII.,"discussion, nor in social concerns, nor in appropriating the right sense"
16703,SECTION LII.,"of the scriptures, is there any that can approach thee, O hero. Verily"
16704,SECTION LII.,thou art the foremost among celestials and Asuras. Invincible to the
16705,SECTION LII.,"gods and Asuras themselves gifted with prowess, high spirits and"
16706,SECTION LII.,"intelligence, thou hast in battle oftentimes put to the rout the chiefs"
16707,SECTION LII.,of celestials and monarchs. Those heroes that have heretofore mentally
16708,SECTION LII.,"entertained enmity against such a one as thou, foe of deities and"
16709,SECTION LII.,"Daityas,—heroic and valient and unconquerable, have not been deprived by"
16710,SECTION LII.,thee of their lives.⁴⁰⁸ Nor do I see any good that may likely accrue to
16711,SECTION LII.,us from the slaying of this monkey. Let thy vengeance descend on those
16712,SECTION LII.,"that have despatched the monkey. Whether honest or otherwise, this one"
16713,SECTION LII.,hath been commissioned by others. Advocating interest not his own and
16714,SECTION LII.,"identifying himself with another, an envoy doth not merit the being put"
16715,SECTION LII.,"to death. O king, if this one be slain, no other sky-ranger whatever"
16716,SECTION LII.,"would show himself unto us. Therefore, O captor of hostile capitals, do"
16717,SECTION LII.,not seek to slay this one. Thou shouldst spend thyself on celestials
16718,SECTION LII.,"with Indra (at their head). On his being killed, another see I not who,"
16719,SECTION LII.,"O thou that lovest warfare, can move those haughty sons of a king to"
16720,SECTION LII.,"take up arms against thee. And, O bringer-in of joy unto the heart, it"
16721,SECTION LII.,"is not proper for thee, invincible to celestials and Asuras gifted with"
16722,SECTION LII.,"prowess, high spirits and intelligence, to disappoint the Nairitas (as"
16723,SECTION LII.,"to their eagerness for encounter). They are devoted to thy good, and are"
16724,SECTION LII.,"heroic and intent on thy well-being, born in lines having high and fiery"
16725,SECTION LII.,"virtues, and endowed with intelligence, —the flower of those bearing"
16726,SECTION LII.,arms—and have been maintained by thee. Therefore let a portion of the
16727,SECTION LII.,"forces, having received thy order, march to-day, and bring (hither)"
16728,SECTION LII.,those foolish princes. It is meet that thou shouldst display thy prowess
16729,SECTION LII.,"before foes."" Thereat, the lord of the night-rangers, that potent enemy"
16730,SECTION LII.,"of the celestials and the foremost of Rākshasa monarchs, lending free"
16731,SECTION LII.,"play to his intellect, accepted the excellent words of his younger"

16752,SECTION LIII.,any chastisement save slaying. Certainly the tail is a darling ornament
16753,SECTION LIII.,to a monkey. Therefore let his tail be set on fire anon; and this having

16755,SECTION LIII.,"and acquaintances see him crest-fallen, with his person deformed."" And"
16756,SECTION LIII.,"the lord of Rākshasas ordered,—""With his tail in flames, let this one be"
16757,SECTION LIII.,"taken all round Lankā containing terraces."" Hearing his words, the"
16758,SECTION LIII.,"Rākshasas, cruel through wrath, cover up his (Hanumān’s) tail with worn"
16759,SECTION LIII.,"pieces of cotton cloth. Thereat, even as fire in a forest increaseth on"
16760,SECTION LIII.,"getting dry fuel, the mighty monkey grew in dimensions on his tail being"
16761,SECTION LIII.,"wrapped up. And having soaked (the cloth) in oil, they set fire to it."
16762,SECTION LIII.,"Thereat with his soul overpowered with rage and hatred, and his"
16763,SECTION LIII.,"countenance like the risen sun, he lashed them with his flaming tail."
16764,SECTION LIII.,And those—rangers of the night—those Rākshasas—old and young and
16765,SECTION LIII.,"females—again bringing that foremost of monkeys, grew exceedingly glad."
16766,SECTION LIII.,"And that hero (being bound), entertained a purpose in harmony with the"
16767,SECTION LIII.,"season. ""Albeit bound, the Rākshasas cannot forsooth cope with me."
16768,SECTION LIII.,"Snapping these bonds, I shall, darting up, again slaughter these."
16769,SECTION LIII.,Although agreeably to the mandate of their master these wicked-minded
16770,SECTION LIII.,"ones have bound me, yet have they not been able to clear scores with me."
16771,SECTION LIII.,I can slay all these Rākshasas in battle; but I suffer this
16772,SECTION LIII.,(maltreatment) for not marring the (pure delight) Rāma shall derive from
16773,SECTION LIII.,my deed.⁴⁰⁹ I shall once more range around Lankā. Let this be so. At
16774,SECTION LIII.,night I could not satisfactorily examine the fortifications.⁴¹⁰ For
16775,SECTION LIII.,"certain, by me is to be beheld Lankā when night hath departed. Let them"
16776,SECTION LIII.,bind me anew. The Rākshasas pain me by setting fire to my tail; but my
16777,SECTION LIII.,"mind doth not tire."" Then the Rākshasas, rejoicing greatly, went off,"
16778,SECTION LIII.,"taking that mighty monkey endowed with strength, an elephant (in"
16779,SECTION LIII.,"prowess) among monkeys. And blowing conchs and trumpets, and bruiting it"
16780,SECTION LIII.,"abroad by various actions,⁴¹¹ those Rākshasas of cruel deeds took"
16781,SECTION LIII.,"(Hanumān) about the city (of Lankā). And led by those Rākshasas, that"
16782,SECTION LIII.,"subduer of enemies, Hanumān, experienced delight, and going about the"
16783,SECTION LIII.,"mighty metropolis of the Rākshasas, the redoubted monkey surveyed"

16785,SECTION LIII.,"thronged with edifices, crossings, by-ways, and the interiors of"

16787,SECTION LIII.,"monkey, saying,—""This is a spy."" On Hanumān’s tail being in flames,"
16788,SECTION LIII.,Rākshasis of frightful eyes related unto that exalted lady⁴¹² tidings of
16789,SECTION LIII.,"this great mishap. ""O Sitā, the copper-faced monkey with whom thou hadst"

16791,SECTION LIII.,"cruel words, like unto loss of life, Vaidehi, burning in grief,"
16792,SECTION LIII.,"approached the Fire. And wishing for the welfare of the mighty monkey,"
16793,SECTION LIII.,that large-eyed lady with an intent mind began to pray unto that bearer
16794,SECTION LIII.,"of sacrificial offerings,—""If I have served my lord, if I bear a"
16795,SECTION LIII.,"character, if I have ascetic merit, if I have been the wife of one"

16797,SECTION LIII.,the welfare of the monkey unto that one having eyes like those of a
16798,SECTION LIII.,"young deer, the Fire flamed up,—and Hanumān’s sire, albeit furnished"
16799,SECTION LIII.,"with fire and a tail, blew ice cold before that worshipful one,"
16800,SECTION LIII.,"breathing health (unto Hanumān). On his tail flaming, the monkey"
16801,SECTION LIII.,"reflected,—""This fire is flaming. Why doth it not then burn me all over?"
16802,SECTION LIII.,"I see it of exceeding brightness, yet it paineth me not. (On the"
16803,SECTION LIII.,"contrary), at the end of my tail it seemeth like a mass of ice. Or this"
16804,SECTION LIII.,"is clearly due to Rāma’s power, even like the wonder (that I witnessed)"
16805,SECTION LIII.,while bounding over the main—the mountain under the lord of streams.⁴¹³
16806,SECTION LIII.,If the Ocean and the intelligent Maināka could show such regard for
16807,SECTION LIII.,"Rāma, what may not the Fire do (for him?) Fire doth not burn me for"
16808,SECTION LIII.,"Sitā’s (absolute) goodness, for Rāghava’s prowess, and for (his)"
16809,SECTION LIII.,"friendship with my sire."" Then the elephantine monkey again reflected"
16810,SECTION LIII.,"for a while,—""Why should one like me suffer one’s self to be bound by"
16811,SECTION LIII.,"vile Rākshasas? Therefore it is meet that I should, displaying my"
16812,SECTION LIII.,"prowess, avenge (this wrong)."" Thereat that vehement and mighty monkey"
16813,SECTION LIII.,"snapped his bonds, and furiously springing into the sky, the terrible"
16814,SECTION LIII.,monkey uttered a shout. And then the graceful son of the Wind-god
16815,SECTION LIII.,"arrived at the gate of the city resembling a hill, where Rakshas there"
16816,SECTION LIII.,"were none. And after having attained the magnitude of a mountain, anon"
16817,SECTION LIII.,that self-controlled one diminished himself and cast off his bonds. And
16818,SECTION LIII.,"having freed himself, the graceful one again became mountain-like; and"
16819,SECTION LIII.,"eying around, he saw a bolt standing against the gate. And that"
16820,SECTION LIII.,"mighty-armed one, the Wind-god’s son, taking up that bolt of burnished"
16821,SECTION LIII.,"iron, again slaughtered the guards. And having slain the warders, that"
16822,SECTION LIII.,one of terrific prowess crowned with a luminous wreath forged from his
16823,SECTION LIII.,"flaming tail, and appearing like the sun garlanded with glory, once"
16824,SECTION LIII.,again cast his eyes over Lankā.

16896,SECTION LIV.,"and lapises and pearls and silver, runing down in streams from the"
16897,SECTION LIV.,"mansions. And as Fire is not cloyed with wood and straw, Hanumān never"
16898,SECTION LIV.,at all felt satiety on slaying those foremost of Rākshasas. And the
16899,SECTION LIV.,Earth could not contain the Rākshasas slain by Hanumān. And as Rudra had

16905,SECTION LIV.,"representing sacrificial offerings, spread his magnitude, touching the"

16908,SECTION LIV.,"mighty Fire completely encompassing the entire Lankā, increased (in"
16909,SECTION LIV.,"volume), riving the mundane Egg with various sounds resembling"

16921,SECTION LIV.,"power,—now come hither in its own illusory nature, assuming a"
16922,SECTION LIV.,"monkey-form?"" Seeing that city suddenly consumed, with her souls,"
16923,SECTION LIV.,"dwellings, and trees, Rākshasas of note, assembled together, thus talked"
16924,SECTION LIV.,"unto each other. And then Lankā, suddenly consumed with Rākshasas,"
16925,SECTION LIV.,"horses, cars, serpents, crowds of birds, beasts and trees, began to"
16926,SECTION LIV.,"bewail tumultuously and loud in forlorn guise,—""O father! O son! O love!"
16927,SECTION LIV.,O friend! O lord of my life and frame! all our religious merit is
16928,SECTION LIV.,"abolished."" Indulging in various lamentations, the Rakshas thus created"
16929,SECTION LIV.,"a mighty and frightful uproar. And with the flames encircling her, and"
16930,SECTION LIV.,"her foremost heroes fallen, and her warriors destroyed, Lankā, overcome"
16931,SECTION LIV.,"by the might of Hanumān’s wrath, became as if she had been blighted by"
16932,SECTION LIV.,an imprecation. Then the mighty-minded Hanumān beheld the Rākshasas in
16933,SECTION LIV.,"terror and trepidation and castdown, and Lankā marked by fire and bright"
16934,SECTION LIV.,"flames, even as the Self-sprung eyeth the world destroyed by his rage."
16935,SECTION LIV.,"And devastating the forest filled with many excellent trees, slaying"
16936,SECTION LIV.,"many a terrible Rākshasa in conflict, and burning down the city of Lankā"
16937,SECTION LIV.,"filled with picturesque houses, the monkey, Hanumān, Wind-god’s son,"
16938,SECTION LIV.,"stationed himself there. And destroying many a Rākshasa, felling many"
16939,SECTION LIV.,"trees in the forest and setting fire to the houses of the Rākshasas, the"
16940,SECTION LIV.,high-souled (monkey) became engaged in thoughts touching Rāma. Thereupon
16941,SECTION LIV.,"all the celestials praised highly the high-souled, excellent and mighty"
16942,SECTION LIV.,"son of the Wind-god, foremost of heroic monkeys, gifted with the"
16943,SECTION LIV.,"velocity of the Wind. And all the celestials, the foremost ascetics, the"
16944,SECTION LIV.,"_Gandharbas_, the _Vidhyādharas_, the _Pannagas_, and all other great"

16946,SECTION LIV.,"slain the Rākshasas in conflict and burnt the grand city of Lankā, the"
16947,SECTION LIV.,great monkey appeared there. And seated on the variegated top of a
16948,SECTION LIV.,"splendid and high mansion, the foremost of monkeys, spreading the rays"
16949,SECTION LIV.,"of his burning tail, looked like unto the sun of many rays. And having"
16950,SECTION LIV.,"consumed the city of Lankā, the great monkey quenched the fire of his"

16975,SECTION LV.,cannot be spoken by them. He is the proper person who can subdue his
16976,SECTION LV.,rising ire by means of forgiveness as a serpent leaves off his worn
16977,SECTION LV.,"skin. O fie on me who am vicious-minded, shameless and the perpetrator"
16978,SECTION LV.,"of a mighty iniquity. Not thinking of Sitā, I have slain my master with"
16979,SECTION LV.,"fire. Forsooth hath the worshipful Jānaki been burnt, since the whole"
16980,SECTION LV.,"city of Lankā hath been devastated with fire. And she being burnt,"
16981,SECTION LV.,foolishly have I spoilt the work of my master. I have defeated the great
16982,SECTION LV.,"object for which I have laboured so much. In burning down Lankā, I have"
16983,SECTION LV.,"not saved Sitā. To have burnt down Lankā is assuredly a trifle, but in"
16984,SECTION LV.,"my ire I have lost my great object. Forsooth hath Janaki been consumed,"
16985,SECTION LV.,since I behold no spot in Lankā which is not made desolate with fire— in
16986,SECTION LV.,fact the whole city hath been reduced to ashes. As I have committed such
16987,SECTION LV.,"an injury under the influence of my perverse understanding, it behoveth"
16988,SECTION LV.,me to relinquish my life here. I shall jump into this flame or into a
16989,SECTION LV.,"submarine fire, or I shall resign my mortal frame to the animals that"
16990,SECTION LV.,"infest the ocean. For, living, I shall not be able to face that lord of"
16991,SECTION LV.,"monkeys, and how shall I, having spoilt their work utterly, show myself"
16992,SECTION LV.,unto those foremost of men? I have through my culpable passion furnished
16993,SECTION LV.,"an illustration of the reckless monkey-nature, which is well known over"
16994,SECTION LV.,"the three worlds. Fie on this activity, born of (the quality of)"
16995,SECTION LV.,"passion, which is the source of incompetence and rashness; since"
16996,SECTION LV.,"although capable, I did not protect Sitā. On Sitā having met with"
16997,SECTION LV.,"destruction, both of them⁴¹⁷ shall cease to exist; and on their ceasing"
16998,SECTION LV.,"to exist, Sugriva shall die along with his friends. And hearing these"
16999,SECTION LV.,"tidings, how shall the righteous Bharata, attached unto his brother"
17000,SECTION LV.,"(Rāma), along with Satrughna, live? And on the virtuous Ikshwāku race"
17001,SECTION LV.,"being extinct, without doubt, all the subjects shall be overwhelmed with"
17002,SECTION LV.,"grief. Therefore, I of curst luck hath had my harvest of virtue and"
17003,SECTION LV.,"profit taken away; and being under the influence of baleful passion, I"
17004,SECTION LV.,"am the cause of the destruction of creatures."" As he was reflecting"
17005,SECTION LV.,"thus, he bethought him of auspicious omens which he had witnessed since."
17006,SECTION LV.,"""Or it may be that one of charming limbs hath been preserved by her"
17007,SECTION LV.,"proper energy. The blessed one may not have met with her end, for fire"
17008,SECTION LV.,doth burn fire. And Fire should not touch the spouse of that virtuous
17009,SECTION LV.,"one of immeasurable energy,—who is protected by by her own character."
17010,SECTION LV.,"And that bearer of sacrificial offerings hath not burnt me, is owing to"
17011,SECTION LV.,Rāma’s power and the virtue of Vaidehi. And why should she that is a
17012,SECTION LV.,"very goddess unto the three brothers, Bharata and the others, and that"
17013,SECTION LV.,"hath enchanted the mind of Rāma, meet with destruction? And when that"
17014,SECTION LV.,"everywhere unspent Lord, having burning for his office, hath not"
17015,SECTION LV.,"consumed my tail, why shoud he burn the exalted lady?"" Then Hanumān with"
17016,SECTION LV.,wonder again thought of the sight of the golden mountain under the
17017,SECTION LV.,"water.⁴¹⁸ ""By virtue of her asceticism, veracity, and devotion unto her"
17018,SECTION LV.,"lord, she it is that can consume Fire, but Fire cannot burn her."" And as"
17019,SECTION LV.,Hanumān was thinking of the magnitude of that revered lady’s religious
17020,SECTION LV.,"merit, he heard the converse there of high-souled Chāranas. ""Ah! hard is"
17021,SECTION LV.,the feat that Hanumān hath forsooth achieved. He hath created a terrific
17022,SECTION LV.,and fierce conflagration in the abode of the Raksha. The females of
17023,SECTION LV.,"Rakshas accompanied by boys and old folks, are flying amain; and in"
17024,SECTION LV.,consequence of the hubbub it seems as if (Lankā) is in lamentation
17025,SECTION LV.,through her mountain-caverns. Burnt is this city of Lankā with her
17026,SECTION LV.,"turrets, walls and gateways; and we are astonished that Jānaki is not"
17027,SECTION LV.,"burnt."" These words resembling ambrosia Hanumān heard (at that time);"
17028,SECTION LV.,and his mind was filled with joy. And what through the auspicious omens
17029,SECTION LV.,"that he had witnessed, and what through the speech of the saints,"
17030,SECTION LV.,"Hanumān was delighted (beyond measure). Then the monkey, with his end"
17031,SECTION LV.,"attained, knowing that the king’s daughter was unhurt, became bent upon"
17032,SECTION LV.,returning after seeing her once again.

17045,SECTION LVI.,"Then seeing Jānaki seated at the foot of the Sinsapa tree, (Hanumān)"
17046,SECTION LVI.,"saluting her said,—""By luck it is that I see thee unhurt."" Then eying"
17047,SECTION LVI.,"him again and again as he was on the point of departing, Sitā said unto"
17048,SECTION LVI.,"Hanumān in words informed with affection for her husband,—""If, my child,"
17049,SECTION LVI.,"it liketh thee, do thou, O stainless one, stay here today in some"
17050,SECTION LVI.,"retired spot. To-morrow having refreshed thyself, thou shalt set out."
17051,SECTION LVI.,"Thy vicinity, O monkey, for a while beguiles me of slender luck of my"
17052,SECTION LVI.,"measureless grief. Thou wilt go, O powerful monkey; but ere thou return,"
17053,SECTION LVI.,"it is, O foremost of monkeys, doubtful whether I shall live. And, O"
17054,SECTION LVI.,"hero, the not seeing thee shall try me sorely, who have fallen from one"
17055,SECTION LVI.,"misfortune into a greater one, and who, my mind distracted, have been"
17056,SECTION LVI.,"exercised by sorrow. And, O hero, this mighty doubt is (ever) present"
17057,SECTION LVI.,before me. How shall that exceedingly powerful one or that host of
17058,SECTION LVI.,"monkeys or those two sons of that man of men, albeit backed by mighty"
17059,SECTION LVI.,"monkeys, cross over the ocean incapable of being crossed? Three beings"
17060,SECTION LVI.,"have the power to bound over the deep;— Vinatā’s offspring, thou, and"
17061,SECTION LVI.,"the Wind-god. Then in this business at hand hard to accomplish, what"
17062,SECTION LVI.,"means dost thou, versed in business, see, whereby the end may be"
17063,SECTION LVI.,"attained?— O slayer of hostile heroes, thou alone art quite competent to"
17064,SECTION LVI.,perform this task; and thou shalt attain fame through thy rising
17065,SECTION LVI.,"prowess. But if blocking up Lankā with his forces, that afflictor of"
17066,SECTION LVI.,"enemies, Kākutstha, taketh me (from hence,) then that shall be worthy of"
17067,SECTION LVI.,him.—Therefore do thou so order things that that powerful and
17068,SECTION LVI.,"high-souled hero in conflict, may act as becomes himself."" Hearing her"
17069,SECTION LVI.,"resonable, affectionate and pregnant speech, that hero, Hanumin,"
17070,SECTION LVI.,"answered,—""O noble lady, that lord and foremost of monkeys, Sugriva"
17071,SECTION LVI.,"gifted with strength, is determined on thy behalf. And that master of"
17072,SECTION LVI.,"monkeys, Sugriva, O Vaidehi, surrounded by thousands and Kotis of"
17073,SECTION LVI.,"monkeys, shall speedily come here (for the purpose). And those best of"
17074,SECTION LVI.,"men, those heroes, Rāma and Lakshmana, coming together, shall afflict"
17075,SECTION LVI.,Lankā with their arrows. And slaughtering the Rākshasa with his own
17076,SECTION LVI.,"adherents, Raghu’s son, O exceedingly fair one, shall ere long take thee"
17077,SECTION LVI.,"back to his palace.—O gentle damsel, do thou console thyself. Remain,"
17078,SECTION LVI.,expecting the hour. Soon shalt thou see Rāvana slain in battle by Rāma.
17079,SECTION LVI.,"On the lord of Rākshasas being slain along with his sons, councilors,"
17080,SECTION LVI.,"and friends, thou shalt meet with Rāma as Rohini meeteth with the Moon."
17081,SECTION LVI.,"At once shall Kākutstha come, accompanied by the foremost of"
17082,SECTION LVI.,"monkeys,—who, conquering (Rāvana) in conflict, shall remove thy grief."""
17083,SECTION LVI.,"Having thus consoled Videha’s daughter, Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god,"
17084,SECTION LVI.,"setting his heart upon departure, saluted Vaidehi. And having soothed"
17085,SECTION LVI.,"Vaidehi, and displayed his surpassing strength, having rendered the city"
17086,SECTION LVI.,"disconsolate, and baffled Rāvana, exhibited his terrific might, and"
17087,SECTION LVI.,"saluted Vaidehi, Hanumān became bent upon returning, crossing over the"
17088,SECTION LVI.,"mid-sea. Then that repressor of foes, the powerful monkey, anxious to"
17089,SECTION LVI.,"see his master, ascended Aristha, foremost of mountains; (as if covered)"
17090,SECTION LVI.,"with a sheet consisting of blue woods of tall _padmakas_, and clouds"
17091,SECTION LVI.,"lying in the interspace between peaks,—and displayed from love by the"
17092,SECTION LVI.,glad light of the Sun; appearing to be beholding with the minerals
17093,SECTION LVI.,scattered about serving for its eyes; seeming to be reciting aloud in
17094,SECTION LVI.,"consequence of the solemn sound of waters, to be carolling clearly"
17095,SECTION LVI.,"through its many fountains, and to stay with uplifted arms by means of"
17096,SECTION LVI.,_devadarus_; appearing to be crying distressfully on account of cascades
17097,SECTION LVI.,sounding all round; seeming to be trembling in consequence of verdant
17098,SECTION LVI.,"autumnal woods waving, and to be piping on account of _kichakas_ vocal"
17099,SECTION LVI.,through the breeze; eloquent; with the foremost poisonous serpents
17100,SECTION LVI.,appearing to be sighing forth ire; appearing to be sunk in contemplation
17101,SECTION LVI.,on account of caverns covered with snow and looking solemn in
17102,SECTION LVI.,consequence; as if moving about by means of hills looking like its
17103,SECTION LVI.,cloud-legs; seeming to yawn in the sky with peaks towering
17104,SECTION LVI.,"heavenwards,—scattered with summits, and graced with innumerable caves;"
17105,SECTION LVI.,"surrounded with _sālas_, palms, _tamālas_, Karnas, and bamboos; graced"
17106,SECTION LVI.,"with spreading and flowering underwoods; abounding in various beasts,"
17107,SECTION LVI.,"and decked with mineral streams,—containing numerous rills,— thronged"
17108,SECTION LVI.,"with collections of crags; frequented by Maharshis, and Yakshas, and"
17109,SECTION LVI.,Gandharbas and Kinnaras and serpents; impracticable in consequence of
17110,SECTION LVI.,plants and trees; with caverns harbouring lions; filled with tigers and
17111,SECTION LVI.,other (ferocious beasts); and furnished with trees having tasteful
17112,SECTION LVI.,fruits and roots. And the Wind-god’s offspring—foremost of
17113,SECTION LVI.,monkeys—ascended that mountain. Aud on the lovely level of that
17114,SECTION LVI.,"mountain, the crags, crushed with sounds under the tread of that one"
17115,SECTION LVI.,"burning to behold Rāma and wrought up with excess of joy, were scattered"
17116,SECTION LVI.,"all round. And ascending that lordly hill, the mighty monkey magnified"
17117,SECTION LVI.,"himself, desirous of going from the southern to the northern shore of"
17118,SECTION LVI.,"the salt waters. And getting to the top of the mountain, that hero, son"
17119,SECTION LVI.,"unto the Wind-god, cast his eyes upon the dreadful main inhabited by"
17120,SECTION LVI.,"terrible snakes. And that foremost of monkeys, offspring of the"
17121,SECTION LVI.,"Wind-god,⁴¹⁹ (mentally) went from the south to the north, as if it were"
17122,SECTION LVI.,"the air. And then that best of mountains, sore pressed by the monkey,"
17123,SECTION LVI.,"began to emit cries, and with various creatures (on it), entered"
17124,SECTION LVI.,"underneath the Earth, with its peaks tottering and its trees toppling."
17125,SECTION LVI.,"And borne down by the violence of his thighs, trees bearing flowers,"
17126,SECTION LVI.,"being shattered, as if destroyed by Sakra’s weapon, fell to the ground."
17127,SECTION LVI.,"And the dreadful yells of mighty lions in pain, inhabiting caves,"
17128,SECTION LVI.,"entered the ear, piercing the heavens. And Vidyādharis with their"
17129,SECTION LVI.,"attires falling off and their ornaments disordered, suddenly rose from"
17130,SECTION LVI.,the mountain⁴²⁰ unto the sky. And exceedingly powerful and mighty snakes
17131,SECTION LVI.,"of virulent venom,—having flaming tongues, with their hoods and necks"
17132,SECTION LVI.,"tortured, began to roll (on the earth). And Kinnars and serpents,"
17133,SECTION LVI.,"Gandharbas, Yakshas and Vidyādharas, forsaking that foremost of"
17134,SECTION LVI.,"mountains in affliction, took refuge in the sky. And that graceful"
17135,SECTION LVI.,"mountain also, tormented by that powerful one, entered the nether"
17136,SECTION LVI.,"regions with its tall trees and summits. And that mountain, which"
17137,SECTION LVI.,"(heretofore) had measured ten _yojanas_ in area and thirty in height,"
17138,SECTION LVI.,became level with the earth. And desirous of crossing over the salt
17139,SECTION LVI.,"waters, with their shores menaced by sounding (waves), the monkey rose"
17140,SECTION LVI.,to the sky.
17141,SECTION LVI.,
17142,SECTION LVI.,"⁴¹⁹ _Māruta_—this term is used twice in this sloka, once for Hanumān,"

17151,SECTION LVII.,SECTION LVII.
17152,SECTION LVII.,
17153,SECTION LVII.,
17154,SECTION LVII.,"And springing up like unto a winged hill, that one endowed with energy,"
17155,SECTION LVII.,"the untiring Hanumān, began to swim on the ocean of the firmament having"
17156,SECTION LVII.,"for its blown lotuses and lilies, snakes, Yakshas and Gandharbas; with"
17157,SECTION LVII.,the Moon for its comely _Kumuda_;⁴²¹ and with the Sun for its
17158,SECTION LVII.,_Kārandavas_; charming to behold; having Tishya and Srāvana for its
17159,SECTION LVII.,"swans, clouds for its mosses and grass, _Punarvasu_ for its mighty fish,"
17160,SECTION LVII.,"the red-bodied one⁴²² for its huge aquatic animal, Airāvata for its"
17161,SECTION LVII.,"spacious island, Swāti for its sportive swan, breezes for its billows,"
17162,SECTION LVII.,and moonlight for its cool waters. And as if swallowing up the welkin
17163,SECTION LVII.,"and touching the lord of stars, abolishing the sky decorated with stars"
17164,SECTION LVII.,"and the solar disc, and cleaving the clouds, the unfatigued Hanumān"
17165,SECTION LVII.,began to cross over that sea. And (on all sides) mighty masses of
17166,SECTION LVII.,"clouds, sable, crimson, blue, Mangistha-hued, and green-red, looked"
17167,SECTION LVII.,exceedingly beautiful. And now entering into clouds and now imerging
17168,SECTION LVII.,"from them, he, again and again becoming visible and lost to sight,"
17169,SECTION LVII.,"looked like the Moon. And that one clad in white raiment, coursing"
17170,SECTION LVII.,"through diverse clouds, the hero’s body was (alternately) visible and"
17171,SECTION LVII.,"invisible, like unto the Moon in the sky. And the Wind-god’s son went on"
17172,SECTION LVII.,"in the sky, scattering the clouds and descending again and again. And"
17173,SECTION LVII.,"sending up mighty sounds, that exceedingly energetic one gifted with a"
17174,SECTION LVII.,"powerful voice like that of the clouds, having slain the foremost"
17175,SECTION LVII.,"Rākshasas and rendered his name famous, having filled the city with"
17176,SECTION LVII.,"lamentations and afflicted Rāvana, having distressed the mighty heroes"
17177,SECTION LVII.,"and paid obeisance unto Vaidehi,—again held his course along the"
17178,SECTION LVII.,mid-ocean. And touching Maināka—foremost of mountains—that one endowed
17179,SECTION LVII.,with prowess proceeded amain like an iron dart let go from a string. And
17180,SECTION LVII.,"from a distance approaching and beholding that mighty mountain,"
17181,SECTION LVII.,"Mahendra, resembling clouds, that redoubted monkey began to roar. And"
17182,SECTION LVII.,"having a lusty voice resembling that of clouds, that monkey, roaring,"
17183,SECTION LVII.,"filled all quarters with his lofty shouts. And arriving at that place,"
17184,SECTION LVII.,"he, eager to behold his friends, emitted tremendous roars, and began to"
17185,SECTION LVII.,flourish his tail. And as he went on roaring in the path ranged by
17186,SECTION LVII.,"Suparna, the firmament with the solar disc seemed to be rent by his"
17187,SECTION LVII.,shouts. And (it came to pass that) those powerful and heroic (monkeys)
17188,SECTION LVII.,that had formerly stationed themselves on the northern shore of the
17189,SECTION LVII.,"ocean, anxious to see the Wind-god’s offspring, heard the sounds"
17190,SECTION LVII.,"proceeding from Hanumān’s vehement speed, resembling the rumbling of"
17191,SECTION LVII.,"clouds agitated by the winds. And all those rangers of woods, (staying)"
17192,SECTION LVII.,"dispirited, heard the roars of that foremost of monkeys, like unto the"
17193,SECTION LVII.,roaring of rain-pouring clouds. And hearing those sounds as he kept
17194,SECTION LVII.,"crying, those monkeys (sitting) around, eager to see their friend,"
17195,SECTION LVII.,"became extremely anxious. And that best of monkeys, Jambavān, with a"
17196,SECTION LVII.,"joyful heart addressing all the monkeys, said,—""Hanumān hath succeeded"
17197,SECTION LVII.,"completely. There is no doubt about this. If he were unsuccessful, he"
17198,SECTION LVII.,"would not utter shouts as these."" And hearing the sounds produced by the"
17199,SECTION LVII.,"violent movements of the arms of that high-souled (hero), as well as the"
17200,SECTION LVII.,"shouts of that magnanimous one, the monkeys, filled with delight, leapt"
17201,SECTION LVII.,"up on all sides. And they, eager to have a sight of Hanumān, joyfully"
17202,SECTION LVII.,went from mountain-top to mountain-top and from peak on to peak. And
17203,SECTION LVII.,"influenced by joy, the monkeys remained holding a bough at the top of a"
17204,SECTION LVII.,"tree, and waving their clean apparels. And as the wind roareth in a"
17205,SECTION LVII.,"cavern, roared the powerful Hanumān, son unto the Wind-god. And seeing"
17206,SECTION LVII.,"that mighty monkey resembling a mass of clouds, alighting, those monkeys"
17207,SECTION LVII.,stood joining their hands. And then the vehement monkey resembling a
17208,SECTION LVII.,"hill, having leapt up from that mountain, alighted on the top of that"
17209,SECTION LVII.,"(other) mountain⁴²³ filled with trees. And bursting with delight,"
17210,SECTION LVII.,"(Hanumān) dropped near a fountain, like unto a hill whose wings have"
17211,SECTION LVII.,"been clipped. Then with joyful hearts, all the principal monkeys stood"
17212,SECTION LVII.,"encircling the high-souled Hanumān. And surrounding him, they"
17213,SECTION LVII.,"experienced excess of delight, and drew near the newcomer with joyful"
17214,SECTION LVII.,"faces. And bringing fruits and roots, the monkeys honored that chief of"
17215,SECTION LVII.,"monkeys, the offspring of the Wind-god. And some, filled with delight,"
17216,SECTION LVII.,"sent shouts, and some raised ululations; and the foremost monkeys"
17217,SECTION LVII.,"fetched branches of trees.⁴²⁴ And that mighty monkey, Hanumān, saluted"
17218,SECTION LVII.,"his superiors and the aged, headed by Jambavān; as well as Prince"
17219,SECTION LVII.,"Angada. And honored by the monkeys, as he very well deserved to be, and"
17220,SECTION LVII.,"gratified by them, (he) briefly said—""Seen have I the exalted lady."" And"
17221,SECTION LVII.,"taking Vāli’s son by the hand, he sat him down in a charming tract of"
17222,SECTION LVII.,"the woodland belonging to the mountain Mahendra.—Then asked (by them),"
17223,SECTION LVII.,"Hanumān addressed those foremost monkeys,—""I have seen Janaka’s daughter"
17224,SECTION LVII.,in the Açoka woods. That blameless one is guarded by dreadful Rākshasis.
17225,SECTION LVII.,"The girt weareth a single braid of hair, and burneth to attain a sight"
17226,SECTION LVII.,"of Rāma. She is faint in consequence of fasting, and dirty, weareth"
17227,SECTION LVII.,"matted locks and is emaciated."" Hearing the words, ""I have seen"" from"
17228,SECTION LVII.,"the Wind-god’s offspring resembling ambrosia, all the monkeys were"
17229,SECTION LVII.,"filled with rejoicing. And thereupon, some of mighty ones roared, and"
17230,SECTION LVII.,"some shouted, aid some blustered, and some raised ululations, and others"
17231,SECTION LVII.,stormed (in return). And some elephantine monkeys in joy upraised their
17232,SECTION LVII.,"tails, and some lashed with their long and broad tails. And others,"
17233,SECTION LVII.,"transported with joy, bounding up to the mountain-summit, touched that"
17234,SECTION LVII.,"foremost of monkeys, the handsome Hanumān. And when Hanumān had ended,"
17235,SECTION LVII.,Angada said these excellent words in the midst of the heroic
17236,SECTION LVII.,"monkeys,—""There is none, O monkey, that is like unto thee in strength"
17237,SECTION LVII.,"and prowess. As having bounded over the spacious main, thou hast come"
17238,SECTION LVII.,"back (here), thou art, O excellent monkey, the only giver of our lives."
17239,SECTION LVII.,"By thy grace it is that, our end attained, we shall meet with Rāghava."
17240,SECTION LVII.,Oh for thy fidelity! Oh for thy prowess! Oh for thy fortitude! By luck
17241,SECTION LVII.,"hast thou seen that exalted one, the illustrious wife of Rāma, by luck"
17242,SECTION LVII.,it is that Kākutstha shall forego his sorrow in consequence of
17243,SECTION LVII.,"separation from Sitā."" Then surrounding Angada, Hanumān, and Jāmbavān,"
17244,SECTION LVII.,"the monkeys, exceedingly rejoiced, sat down upon a spacious stone. And"
17245,SECTION LVII.,"having sat them down on the spacious rock, the monkeys became eager to"
17246,SECTION LVII.,"hear of the bounding of the main and of (Hanumān’s) seeing Lankā, Sitā"
17247,SECTION LVII.,"and Rāvana. And they stood with joined hands, looking wistfully into"
17248,SECTION LVII.,"Hanumān’s face. And the graceful Angada was there, surrounded by many"
17249,SECTION LVII.,"monkeys, and honored by them, even as the lord of celestials is honored"
17250,SECTION LVII.,"in heaven by the celestials. When the famous and renowned Hanumān, and"

17268,SECTION LVIII.,"headed by Hanumān, rejoiced exceedingly. And when the high-souled"
17269,SECTION LVIII.,"delighted monkeys had sat them down, Jāmbavān, glad at heart, asked that"
17270,SECTION LVIII.,"offspring of the Wind, the happy Hanumān, all about his proceeding: ""How"
17271,SECTION LVIII.,hast thou seen the worshipful one? How doth she fare there? And how doth
17272,SECTION LVIII.,the cruel Ten-necked one bear himself towards her? Do thou truthfully
17273,SECTION LVIII.,"relate all this unto us, O mighty monkey. How couldst thou track the"
17274,SECTION LVIII.,exalted lady? And what did she say in reply (to thy querries)? Having
17275,SECTION LVIII.,"learnt the real state of things, we shall decide what is to be done. And"
17276,SECTION LVIII.,"do thou also tell us what we, repairing there, shall unfold unto that"
17277,SECTION LVIII.,"one of controled self and what we shall keep to ourselves."" Thus"
17278,SECTION LVIII.,"directed by him, that one (Hanumān) with his down standing on end,"
17279,SECTION LVIII.,"bowing down the head unto that revered one, Sitā, replied,—""In your"
17280,SECTION LVIII.,"sight, I bounded up with a concentrated mind, eager to reach the"
17281,SECTION LVIII.,"southern shore of the ocean. As I voyaged on, a great impediment"
17282,SECTION LVIII.,"occurred in the way. I saw a goodly and noble golden peak, standing,"
17283,SECTION LVIII.,obstructing my way. I found the mountain as an obstacle to my course.
17284,SECTION LVIII.,"Nearing the grand and splendid golden mount, I thought within myself,—’I"
17285,SECTION LVIII.,"will rive this.’ And the sun-like summit of that mighty mountain,"
17286,SECTION LVIII.,"Prahasta, was cleft in a thousand fragments by my tail. Seeing his own"
17287,SECTION LVIII.,"condition, that mighty mountain, gladdening my heart, addressed me with"
17288,SECTION LVIII.,"the sweet speech,—’O son, know me for thy uncle. I am a friend unto the"
17289,SECTION LVIII.,"Wind,— famed as Maināka, and living in the great deep. Formerly all the"
17290,SECTION LVIII.,foremost mountains were furnished with wings. And (once on a time) they
17291,SECTION LVIII.,"began to range the earth at will, committing devastations. Hearing of"
17292,SECTION LVIII.,"the conduct of the mountains, that possessor of the six kinds of riches,"
17293,SECTION LVIII.,"Indra the Great, the swayer of Paka, with his thunderbolt cut off by"
17294,SECTION LVIII.,"thousands the pinions of the mountains. At that time, my son, I, having"
17295,SECTION LVIII.,"been delivered by thy sire, the high-souled Wind-god, was cast into the"
17296,SECTION LVIII.,"abode of Varuna. O repressor of foes, I shall have to assist Rāghava."
17297,SECTION LVIII.,"Rāma is the foremost of the righteous, and possessed of prowess like"
17298,SECTION LVIII.,that of Mahendra himself.’ Having heard this from the magnanimous
17299,SECTION LVIII.,"Maināka, I apprised the mountain of my mission, and my thoughts held"
17300,SECTION LVIII.,"their course. Having given me his permission, the magnanimous Maināka,"
17301,SECTION LVIII.,"the mountain that had put on the form of a man, vanished, and, assuming"
17302,SECTION LVIII.,"his mountain-form, went into the vast sea. And I, summoning my best"
17303,SECTION LVIII.,"celerity, began to journey the remainder of my way. And having swiftly"
17304,SECTION LVIII.,"proceeded long in the path, I saw the exalted lady, Surasā, mother of"
17305,SECTION LVIII.,"the serpents. And that worshipful one stationed in the sea, said,—’By"
17306,SECTION LVIII.,"the celestials hast thou, O best of monkeys, been assigned as my food."
17307,SECTION LVIII.,Therefore shall I eat thee up. Thou hast been ordained as mine by the
17308,SECTION LVIII.,"gods.’ Thus addressed by Surasā, I, remaining in humble guise with"
17309,SECTION LVIII.,"joined hands, and with my countenance turned pale, I uttered these"
17310,SECTION LVIII.,"words,—’Rāma, the graceful son of Daçaratha, repressor of foes—hath"
17311,SECTION LVIII.,"entered the woods of Dandaka, in company with his brother Lakshamana and"
17312,SECTION LVIII.,Sitā. His wife Sitā hath been carried off by the wicked Rāvana. At
17313,SECTION LVIII.,"Rāma’s mandate I go to her as an envoy. In this business, thou, O chaste"
17314,SECTION LVIII.,"one, shouldst help Rāma. Or having seen Mithilā’s daughter, as well as"
17315,SECTION LVIII.,"Rāma of untiring deeds, I shall come to thy mouth,—this I promise unto"
17316,SECTION LVIII.,"thee truly.’ Thus accosted by me, Surasā, wearing forms at her will,"
17317,SECTION LVIII.,"said,—’None is able to escape me. Even this is the boon that I have"
17318,SECTION LVIII.,"received.’ Having been thus addressed by Surasā, I attained the"
17319,SECTION LVIII.,magnitude of ten _yojanas_; and then anon I dilated to another ten. But
17320,SECTION LVIII.,she opened her mouth wider than my magnitude. Seeing her stretched
17321,SECTION LVIII.,"mouth, I again diminished myself, and on the instant again reduced"
17322,SECTION LVIII.,"myself to the measure of a thumb. And speedily entering her mouth, I"
17323,SECTION LVIII.,immediately came out. Then the exalted Surasā again spoke unto me in her
17324,SECTION LVIII.,"native shape,—’Thy end having been attained, go, O mild one, O foremost"
17325,SECTION LVIII.,"of monkeys, according to thy pleasure. Bring about the meeting of"
17326,SECTION LVIII.,"Vaidehi with the high-souled Rāghava. Be thou blessed, O mighty-armed"
17327,SECTION LVIII.,"one. I am well pleased with thee, O monkey.’ Then I was praised by all"
17328,SECTION LVIII.,"beings, with,—’Excellent!’ ’Excellent!’ Then like unto Garuda I again"
17329,SECTION LVIII.,"sprang up into the air. But now my shadow was overtaken by somebody,"
17330,SECTION LVIII.,"though I saw no one. And my velocity being deprived, I looked at the ten"
17331,SECTION LVIII.,cardinal points; but I found there naught which could deprive me of my
17332,SECTION LVIII.,"speed. Then I thought,— ’What is this obstacle that hath suddenly arisen"
17333,SECTION LVIII.,"in respect of my course? No form find I here?’ And as I stood aggrieved,"
17334,SECTION LVIII.,my glance fell downwards. Then I saw there a dreadful Rākshasi supine on
17335,SECTION LVIII.,"the flood. And laughing (scornfully), that grim one said these"
17336,SECTION LVIII.,"inauspicious words unto me, who was inert, although undaunted,—""Whither"
17337,SECTION LVIII.,"art thou bound, O thou of a gigantic body? Desired by me, who am hungry,"
17338,SECTION LVIII.,"do thou becoming my food, gratify this body deprived of diet for a long"
17339,SECTION LVIII.,"time.’ Saying, ’Well,’ I accepted her speech, increasing my body at will"
17340,SECTION LVIII.,more than the capacity of her mouth; and her huge and dreadful mouth
17341,SECTION LVIII.,"extended wide to eat me up. She did not understand me,⁴²⁵ nor that I had"
17342,SECTION LVIII.,altered my shape. Then in the twinkling of an eye contracting my vasty
17343,SECTION LVIII.,"shape, I, extracting her heart, darted into the sky. Thereat, throwing"
17344,SECTION LVIII.,"about her arms, that terrific one dropped into the salt waters. On that"
17345,SECTION LVIII.,"chaste one, resembling a hill, having her heart torn, I heard the meek"
17346,SECTION LVIII.,"speech of magnanimous persons, who had come there of themselves,—’This"
17347,SECTION LVIII.,"dreadful Rākshasi, Sinhikā, hath been swiftly slain by Hanumān.’ Having"
17348,SECTION LVIII.,"slain her, I again, remembering the delay that had occurred touching my"
17349,SECTION LVIII.,"work, set out on the great road, and at length saw the southern shore of"
17350,SECTION LVIII.,"the sea, covered with mountains; where is situated the city of Lankā. On"
17351,SECTION LVIII.,"the sun having set, I entered the city of the Rākshasas—their"
17352,SECTION LVIII.,home—unnoticed by the Rākshasas of terrific vigor. I had entered in when
17353,SECTION LVIII.,"a certain female casting forth violent laughter, and wearing the"
17354,SECTION LVIII.,"splendour of clouds at the end of a Kalpa, presented herself before me."
17355,SECTION LVIII.,And striking with my left clenched fist that exceedingly dreadful
17356,SECTION LVIII.,"(form), having flames for her hair, who had sought to take my life,—and"
17357,SECTION LVIII.,"vanquishing her (thus), I entered (Lankā) at dusk. Then that one"
17358,SECTION LVIII.,"affrighted addressed me, saying,—’I, O hero, am, the city of Lankā."
17359,SECTION LVIII.,Vanquished have I been by thy prowess. Thou shalt everywhere conquer all
17360,SECTION LVIII.,the Rākshasas’. There I wandered all the night (seeking for Janaka’s
17361,SECTION LVIII.,daughter) and (at length) entered Rāvana’s inner apartment; but that one
17362,SECTION LVIII.,"of a Diity waist I found not. And not finding Sitā in Rāvana’s abode, I"
17363,SECTION LVIII.,was cast in a sea of sorrow; nor found I how to cross over it. And as I
17364,SECTION LVIII.,"was sorrowing, I saw a mansion with a charming grove encircled by a wall"
17365,SECTION LVIII.,"of excellent gold. And leaping over the wall, I saw a grove rife with"
17366,SECTION LVIII.,trees; and (at last) saw in the midst of an _açoka_ wood a great
17367,SECTION LVIII.,"_Sinçapā_. And ascending the tree, I saw a golden tract of plantains;"
17368,SECTION LVIII.,and hard by from the _Sinçapā_ tree I espied that transcendentally
17369,SECTION LVIII.,"beautiful one, dark-blue, having eyes resembling lotus-petals, with her"
17370,SECTION LVIII.,"face faded in consequence of fasting, clad in the same single piece of"
17371,SECTION LVIII.,"cloth, her hair covered with dust,—her limbs emaciated by the heat of"
17372,SECTION LVIII.,"sorrow and grief,—Sitā, ever engaged in the welfare of her lord;"
17373,SECTION LVIII.,surrounded by cruel and deformed Rākshasis living upon blood and
17374,SECTION LVIII.,"flesh,—like unto deer environed by tigresses. And I managed too swiftly"
17375,SECTION LVIII.,"to present myself before that one, menaced momentarily in the midst of"
17376,SECTION LVIII.,"the Rākshasis, wearing a single braid of hair; woe-begone; ever thinking"
17377,SECTION LVIII.,"of her lord; her limbs discolored by lying down on the ground, like unto"
17378,SECTION LVIII.,"a lotus on the approach of winter,—having eyes resembling those of a"
17379,SECTION LVIII.,"young deer, who had turned her face away from all the enjoyments offered"
17380,SECTION LVIII.,"by Rāvana, and who had resolved to put a period to her existence. Seeing"
17381,SECTION LVIII.,"that lady the illustrious wife of Rāma in that condition, I seeing her"
17382,SECTION LVIII.,remained even on that _Sinçapā_ tree. Then I heard in Rāvana’s mansion
17383,SECTION LVIII.,loud and solemn sounds mixed with the tinklings of zones and bangles.
17384,SECTION LVIII.,"Thereat exceedingly agitated, I changed my proper shape; and remained"
17385,SECTION LVIII.,like a bird in a dark part of the _Sinçapā_ tree. Then the wives of
17386,SECTION LVIII.,Rāvana along with Rāvana himself of exceeding strength came to that
17387,SECTION LVIII.,place where Sitā was. And seeing the lord of Rākshasas the exceedingly
17388,SECTION LVIII.,beauteous Sitā contracted her thighs and covered her full breasts with
17389,SECTION LVIII.,her arms. And seeing Sitā flurried and extremely excited and casting
17390,SECTION LVIII.,"about her gladness up and down, not finding any relief and trembling"
17391,SECTION LVIII.,"forlorn, the Ten-necked one said unto her undergoing extreme"
17392,SECTION LVIII.,"anguish,—""Without saying anything, I fall down (here). O fair one, do"
17393,SECTION LVIII.,"thou regard me. If, O haughty one, thou do not honor me from pride of"
17394,SECTION LVIII.,"heart, I shall, O Sitā, two months hence, see thy blood."" Hearing these"
17395,SECTION LVIII.,"words of the wicked Rāvana, Sitā, growing exceeding wroth, spoke these"
17396,SECTION LVIII.,"excellent words,—""O worst of Rākshasas, having used improper speech"
17397,SECTION LVIII.,"towards the wife of Rāma of measureless prowess, and the daughter-in-law"
17398,SECTION LVIII.,"of Daçaratha, lord of the Ikshwāku line, why hast thou not thy tongue"
17399,SECTION LVIII.,"fallen off? Fie upon the prowess of thee that, O wretch, hast carried me"
17400,SECTION LVIII.,off while my husband was away; and not being seen of that high-souled
17401,SECTION LVIII.,"one. Thou art never like Rāma,—thou art not even fit to be his slave."
17402,SECTION LVIII.,"Rāghava is invincible, truthful, heroic and (even) hungering for"
17403,SECTION LVIII.,"warfare."" Thus addressed in harsh speech by Jānaki, the Ten-necked one"
17404,SECTION LVIII.,"flamed up in wrath, like Fire in a funeral pyre. And with his wicked"
17405,SECTION LVIII.,"eyes whirling in rage, he raised the clenched fist of his right hand to"
17406,SECTION LVIII.,"slay Mithilā’s daughter; but then the females set up a cry of ""Oh"" and"
17407,SECTION LVIII.,"""Alas."" And rising up in the midst of the females, the wife of the"
17408,SECTION LVIII.,"wicked-minded one, the excellent one, named Mandodari, prevented him."
17409,SECTION LVIII.,"And she spoke soft words unto him influenced by lust.—""O thou that"
17410,SECTION LVIII.,resemblest Indra the Great in prowess. Do thou to-day sport with me.
17411,SECTION LVIII.,"Jānaki is not superior to me. And, O lord, do thou sport with the"
17412,SECTION LVIII.,"daughters of celestials and Gandharbas, and with the daughters"
17413,SECTION LVIII.,"themselves of Yakshas. What wilt thou do with Sitā?"" Then that"
17414,SECTION LVIII.,exceedingly powerful ranger of the night was speedily raised up and
17415,SECTION LVIII.,"taken (back) to his residence. On the Ten-necked one having departed,"
17416,SECTION LVIII.,the Rākshasis of fearful faces fell to railing at Sitā in cruel and
17417,SECTION LVIII.,"rough words,—But Jānaki heeded their speech as a straw; and their fury"
17418,SECTION LVIII.,"was lost upon Sitā. Desisting from their unavailing railing, the"
17419,SECTION LVIII.,flesh-feasting Rākshasis imparted unto Rāvana the mighty intent of Sitā.
17420,SECTION LVIII.,"Then, they all failing in their hope and deprived of energy, and tired,"
17421,SECTION LVIII.,"came under the sway of sleep. And on their sleeping, Sitā intent on the"
17422,SECTION LVIII.,"welfare of her lord, lamenting piteously, in forlorn guise, and striken"
17423,SECTION LVIII.,"with extreme sorrow, mourned profusely. Then sitting up in their midst,"
17424,SECTION LVIII.,"Trijatā spoke,—""Do ye without delay fall to your own selves; but never"
17425,SECTION LVIII.,"(eat up) the dark-eyed Sitā, the chaste daughter unto Janaka and the"
17426,SECTION LVIII.,daughter-in-law of Daçaratha. In truth I have seen a dismal dream
17427,SECTION LVIII.,capable of making one’s hair stand on end; (presaging) destruction unto
17428,SECTION LVIII.,"Rākshasas and victory unto the husband of this one. For protecting us,"
17429,SECTION LVIII.,"Rākshasis from Rāghava, let us solicit Vaidehi. Even this is relished by"
17430,SECTION LVIII.,"me. If we relate such a dream unto the aggrieved one, she, being freed"
17431,SECTION LVIII.,"from her diverse woes, shall attain the height of joy. Propitiated by"
17432,SECTION LVIII.,"our bowing down, Janaka’s daughter, Maithili, shall rescue the Rākshasis"
17433,SECTION LVIII.,"from a mighty fear."" Thereat, that bashful maiden, rejoiced at the"
17434,SECTION LVIII.,"prospect of her husband’s victory, said,—’If all this prove true, then"
17435,SECTION LVIII.,"for certain, (ye shall) meet with succour at my hands. Witnessing such a"
17436,SECTION LVIII.,hard condition of Sitā I began to reflect; nor did my my mind attain
17437,SECTION LVIII.,ease or freedom from thought. And I cast about for finding means of
17438,SECTION LVIII.,addressing Jānaki. And I began by extolling the Ikshwāku race. Hearing
17439,SECTION LVIII.,"the words that I uttered, embellished with descriptions of the virtues"
17440,SECTION LVIII.,"of Rājarshis, that exalted lady replied with her eyes covered with"
17441,SECTION LVIII.,"tears. ""Who art thou? And how hast thou, O foremost of monkeys, found"
17442,SECTION LVIII.,thy way here? And what is thy delight in Rāma? This it behoveth thee to
17443,SECTION LVIII.,"relate unto me."" Hearing her speech, I too said,— ’O revered one, thy"
17444,SECTION LVIII.,"husband, Rāma, hath found a help-mate in a one endowed with terrific"
17445,SECTION LVIII.,"strength, named Sugriva —redoubtable, the highly powerful lord of the"
17446,SECTION LVIII.,"monkeys. Do thou know me as Hanumān his servant, despatched here by thy"
17447,SECTION LVIII.,"spouse—Rāma of unwearied actions. O famed damsel, that highly effulgent"
17448,SECTION LVIII.,"son of Daçaratha—the foremost of men, hath sent as a token this ring. I"
17449,SECTION LVIII.,"desire to know, O worshipful dame, what behest of thine may I obey now."
17450,SECTION LVIII.,Shall I carry thee to Rāma and Lakshmana on the northern shore of the
17451,SECTION LVIII.,"Ocean?"" Hearing this and revolving within herself Sitā, Janaka’s"
17452,SECTION LVIII.,"daughter, replied—""Discomfitting Rāvana, may Rāghava himself carry me"
17453,SECTION LVIII.,"hence.’ And bowing my head unto that worshipful and blameless dame, I"
17454,SECTION LVIII.,wanted of her a token as might conduce to Rāghava’s pleasure. Whereto
17455,SECTION LVIII.,replied Sitā—’O thou of mighty-arms do thou take this excellent jewel
17456,SECTION LVIII.,for which thou shalt be highly regarded by Rāma’. Having said this that
17457,SECTION LVIII.,"best of fair ones gave me the excellent jewel, and wrought up with"
17458,SECTION LVIII.,"anxiety, related unto me the story of crow (for Rāma’s information)."
17459,SECTION LVIII.,"Thereupon bent on returning here, I, with a fixed mind, circumambulated"
17460,SECTION LVIII.,and bowed unto that worshipful dame. And revolving within herself she
17461,SECTION LVIII.,"again replied— ’Hanumān, do thou relate this unto Rāghava in such a wise"
17462,SECTION LVIII.,"that the heroes Rāma and Lakshmana, along with Sugriva might instantly"
17463,SECTION LVIII.,come here. Or else there remain two months more of my life. Rāghava
17464,SECTION LVIII.,shall not see me and I shall quit my life like one having no husband.
17465,SECTION LVIII.,Hearing those piteous accents I was worked up with ire and at once
17466,SECTION LVIII.,resolved upon destroying the city of Lankā. Thereupon my body increased
17467,SECTION LVIII.,like unto a mountain and desirous of entering into conflict I began to
17468,SECTION LVIII.,lay waste the forest. The whole forest was devastated—the birds and deer
17469,SECTION LVIII.,"strayed away in fear and the Rākshasees, having terrible faces, awaking,"
17470,SECTION LVIII.,"beheld all that. And beholding me in the forest, they all, gathering,"
17471,SECTION LVIII.,"instantly conveyed the message unto Rāvana. O King, O thou of mighty"
17472,SECTION LVIII.,"prowess, this thy forest and castle has been broken down by the"
17473,SECTION LVIII.,"vicious-souled monkey not knowing thy strength. O King, he has been"
17474,SECTION LVIII.,"impelled by his vicious sense, to do thy mischief. Do thou order for his"
17475,SECTION LVIII.,head so that he might not return. Hearing this the lord of the Rākshasas
17476,SECTION LVIII.,despatched a chosen band of demons named _Kinkaras_.⁴²⁶ I despatched
17477,SECTION LVIII.,with my mace in no time eighty thousand of them no sooner than they
17478,SECTION LVIII.,"entered the forest with darts and maces. And the few, who were saved,"
17479,SECTION LVIII.,proceeded very quickly unto Rāvana and related unto him the destruction
17480,SECTION LVIII.,of the soldiers by me. Thereupon I thought of destroying the
17481,SECTION LVIII.,_Chaitya_⁴²⁷ palace and destroyed with the pillar all the Rākshasas
17482,SECTION LVIII.,stationed there. Excited with wrath I destroyed that palace; the best in
17483,SECTION LVIII.,"the whole city of Lankā. Thereupon (Rāvana) despatched _Jambhumāli_, the"
17484,SECTION LVIII.,"son of _Prahasta_. With my fierce mace I destroyed that mighty Rākshasa,"
17485,SECTION LVIII.,"versed in the art of war, along with his retinue and surrounded by a"
17486,SECTION LVIII.,"band of terrible and grim-visaged demons. Hearing this, Rāvana, the lord"
17487,SECTION LVIII.,of Rākshasas sent the highly powerful sons of the ministers followed by
17488,SECTION LVIII.,a regiment of infantry. But I despatched them to the abode of Death by
17489,SECTION LVIII.,means of my dart. And hearing of the destruction in battle of the
17490,SECTION LVIII.,ministers’ sons of feeble prowess Rāvana sent five heroic commanders.
17491,SECTION LVIII.,But I slew all of them along with their hosts. Thereupon the Ten necked
17492,SECTION LVIII.,demon sent his highly powerful son _Aksha_ in the battle followed by a
17493,SECTION LVIII.,"number of Rākshasas. No sooner the princely son of Mandodari, versed in"
17494,SECTION LVIII.,"the art of war, rose high up in the welkin than I got hold of his legs"
17495,SECTION LVIII.,and whirling him for hundred times ground him to the dust. And hearing
17496,SECTION LVIII.,"of the discomfiture of Aksha, Rāvana, exercised with ire, sent his"
17497,SECTION LVIII.,"second son, the highly powerful Indrajit incapable of being repressed in"
17498,SECTION LVIII.,battle. And discomfitting that best of Rākshasas with his host I
17499,SECTION LVIII.,attained to an excess of delight. That hero of great prowess and
17500,SECTION LVIII.,mighty-arms with a number of other proud heroes was despatched by Rāvana
17501,SECTION LVIII.,in great confidence. And beholding my unbearable prowess and his own
17502,SECTION LVIII.,"soldiers slain, speedily he went away fettering me with his Brahmā"
17503,SECTION LVIII.,weapon. Thereat the other Rākshasas bound me up with a rope and carried
17504,SECTION LVIII.,me to Rāvana. And thereupon I was welcomed by the vicious-souled Rāvana
17505,SECTION LVIII.,and was asked why I did come to Lankā and slay the Rākshasas. Whereto I
17506,SECTION LVIII.,"replied,—""I have done all this for Sitā. To behold her I have come here,"
17507,SECTION LVIII.,"O hero. I am the monkey Hanumān, the own begotten son of Maruta. Do thou"
17508,SECTION LVIII.,know me as Rāma’s ambassador and the minister of Sugriva. And on Rāma’s
17509,SECTION LVIII.,embassy have I come here before thee. Do thou hear of my mission—I do
17510,SECTION LVIII.,"relate unto thee, O lord of Rākshasas, the message which the monkey"
17511,SECTION LVIII.,"chief hath commanded me to communicate unto thee. O great hero, Sugriva"
17512,SECTION LVIII.,hath asked of thy welfare and hath desired me to communicate unto thee
17513,SECTION LVIII.,"these well meaning words, conducing to the acquirement of piety, wealth"
17514,SECTION LVIII.,and desires. While I lived on the mount Rishyamuka covered with huge
17515,SECTION LVIII.,trees I made friends with Rāghava dreadful in conflict. He hath spoken
17516,SECTION LVIII.,"to me, O king, ’My spouse hath been taken away by a Rākshasa. It"
17517,SECTION LVIII.,behoveth thee to promise me thy help in this.’ And in the presence of
17518,SECTION LVIII.,"fire, Rāma, along with Lakshmana, contracted friendship with me who had"
17519,SECTION LVIII.,been deprived of his kingdom by Vāli. And he hath made me lord over all
17520,SECTION LVIII.,the monkeys after slaying Vāli in conflict with a single shaft. It
17521,SECTION LVIII.,therefore behoveth us to assist him by all means. And by virtue of this
17522,SECTION LVIII.,contract I have despatched Hanumān unto thee as an envoy. Do thou
17523,SECTION LVIII.,therefore speedily bring back Sitā and return her unto Rāghava before
17524,SECTION LVIII.,the heroic monkeys discomfit thee. Who knoweth not the prowess of the
17525,SECTION LVIII.,monkeys who in the days of yore used to visit the celestials invited?’
17526,SECTION LVIII.,With these words the king of the monkeys hath despatched me unto thee.
17527,SECTION LVIII.,And thereupon he eyed me as if burning me with the looks of his angry
17528,SECTION LVIII.,"eyes. And the vicious-souled demon—Rāvana, of terrible deeds, ordered"
17529,SECTION LVIII.,"for my destruction, not knowing my prowess. Thereupon Bivishana, the"
17530,SECTION LVIII.,high-souled brother of that lord of the Rākshasas interceded on my
17531,SECTION LVIII.,"behalf in the following strain— ’O thou foremost of the Rākshasas, do"

17533,SECTION LVIII.,pale of royal policy. The destruction of an envoy is not sanctioned by
17534,SECTION LVIII.,"the royal morality, O Rākshasa. They communicate simply the mandate of"
17535,SECTION LVIII.,"their masters. O thou of incomparable prowess, there is no sanction for"
17536,SECTION LVIII.,the destruction of a messenger albeit he perpetrateth a mighty iniquity.
17537,SECTION LVIII.,"Sometimes they have however been disfigured."" Being thus accosted by"
17538,SECTION LVIII.,"Bivishana, Rāvana ordered all the demons, saying ""Burn down this"
17539,SECTION LVIII.,"monkey’s tail.’ Hearing his mandate, the Rākshasas, of well-protected"
17540,SECTION LVIII.,"armour and terrible prowess, enveloped my tail with the fibres of"
17541,SECTION LVIII.,"cotton, silk and jute. And then striking me with their clenched fists"
17542,SECTION LVIII.,they put fire to my tail. Although bound and fettered with many ropes I
17543,SECTION LVIII.,did not feel the least anguish for I was very much anxious to behold the
17544,SECTION LVIII.,city during the day. And thereupon fettering me and putting fire to my
17545,SECTION LVIII.,tail and announcing me in the public streets those heroic Rākshasas got
17546,SECTION LVIII.,at the city gate. And thereupon contracting again my huge person and
17547,SECTION LVIII.,relieving myself of the fetters I stood again in my pristine state. And
17548,SECTION LVIII.,taking up iron darts I slew all the Rākshasas there. And leaping over
17549,SECTION LVIII.,"with great velocity the city gate, I, with my burning tail, burnt down"
17550,SECTION LVIII.,the whole city from the palace to its outer gate like unto the fire of
17551,SECTION LVIII.,dissolution devastating the entire creation. And I was not the least
17552,SECTION LVIII.,flurried at it. ’Forsooth hath Jānaki been destroyed—for behold I
17553,SECTION LVIII.,nothing in Lankā which hath not been burnt down—indeed the whole city
17554,SECTION LVIII.,hath been reduced to ashes. For certain have I burnt down Sitā while
17555,SECTION LVIII.,burning the city Lankā—and I have thus baffled the great work of Rāma.’
17556,SECTION LVIII.,"While I was reflecting thus, being overwhelmed with grief, I heard the"
17557,SECTION LVIII.,"auspicious accents of the _Charanas_, exciting my wonder, ’Jānaki hath"
17558,SECTION LVIII.,not been burnt down.’ Hearing those wonderful words I regained my sense.
17559,SECTION LVIII.,I was then convinced by an auspicious sign that Jānaki  was not burnt
17560,SECTION LVIII.,"down, for I was not reduced to ashes albeit my tail was burning. My"
17561,SECTION LVIII.,heart was excited with joy and the wind spread its delicious fragrance.
17562,SECTION LVIII.,"And by virtue of those manifest omens, by my confidence in the prowess"
17563,SECTION LVIII.,"of Rāma; and Sitā, and the voice of ascetics, I was greately delighted"
17564,SECTION LVIII.,"at heart. And beholding Vaidehi again, I left her. And thereupon"
17565,SECTION LVIII.,"ascending the mount Aristha I began to leap, desirous of beholding you."
17566,SECTION LVIII.,"And following the track of the Wind, the Sun, the Moon, Gandharbas, and"

17689,SECTION LX.,that he would himself rescue Sitā. How would he now falsify his own

17782,SECTION LXII.,some being drunk and delighted struck others down in mad fury. And some
17783,SECTION LXII.,lost their steps. Some roared and some delightedly set up the music of

17786,SECTION LXII.,spoke contrary to what they had done—and others put a different

17788,SECTION LXII.,"of Dadhimukha, were repressed by those terrible monkeys with censure and"
17789,SECTION LXII.,"thrown up in the sky by their knee-joints. And terrified, they fled to"

17846,SECTION LXIII.,"long to know everything, O monkey."" Being thus addressed hopefully by"
17847,SECTION LXIII.,"the high-souled Sugriva, Dadhimukha, gifted with an intelligence of a"
17848,SECTION LXIII.,"very high order, rose up and spoke—""Neither thyself, nor Vāli, the lord"
17849,SECTION LXIII.,"of the monkeys, O king, allowed that orchard to be freely used by the"
17850,SECTION LXIII.,monkeys—but that hath been now laid waste by them. I prevented them
17851,SECTION LXIII.,"along with these attendants, but disregarding me, they drank and feasted"
17852,SECTION LXIII.,"there at their pleasure. They were prevented, O lord, in their act of"
17853,SECTION LXIII.,"devastation, by these guards, but those monkeys, without caring for me"
17854,SECTION LXIII.,"the least, feasted there. Some of them went beyond the pale of good"
17855,SECTION LXIII.,"conduct, others ate at their pleasure, and all frowned (at us). And when"
17856,SECTION LXIII.,"these attendents, being insulted by them, were greatly wroth, they were"
17857,SECTION LXIII.,"driven out of the garden, by those powerful and enraged monkeys. And"
17858,SECTION LXIII.,"they were greatly assailed by those many thousand heroic monkeys, worked"
17859,SECTION LXIII.,"up with ire and having reddened eyes. Some had their arms broken, some"
17860,SECTION LXIII.,had their knee-joints crushed and some of them were thrown up in the
17861,SECTION LXIII.,"sky. Thyself their lord living, these heroes are beaten, and the entire"
17862,SECTION LXIII.,"_Madhuvana_ is being freely enjoyed by them."" The highly intelligent"
17863,SECTION LXIII.,"Lakshmana, the slayer of foes, addressed Sugriva, the foremost of the"
17864,SECTION LXIII.,"monkeys, while he was thus being informed, saying,—""O king, why hath"
17865,SECTION LXIII.,"this monkey, the guard over the forest, come to thee, and what sorrow"
17866,SECTION LXIII.,"hath led him to give vent to these expressions?"" Being thus addressed by"
17867,SECTION LXIII.,"the high-souled Lakshmana, Sugriva, skilled in the art of speech,"
17868,SECTION LXIII.,"replied,—""O worshipful Lakshmana, the heroic monkey Dadhimukha speaks"
17869,SECTION LXIII.,that the war-like monkeys headed by Angada have drunk honey. They would
17870,SECTION LXIII.,not have engaged in such an unfair proceeding had they been unsuccessful
17871,SECTION LXIII.,in their mission. They have surely achieved success while they have thus
17872,SECTION LXIII.,been bent upon devastating the orchard. For this the warders were struck
17873,SECTION LXIII.,on their knee-joints for obstructing their revelry and for this they
17874,SECTION LXIII.,went so far as to disregard the powerful monkey Dadhimukha. I myself
17875,SECTION LXIII.,appointed this monkey the lord of my orchard. Forsooth hath Hanumān
17876,SECTION LXIII.,espied the worshipful Sitā and none else. There is none else but Hanumān
17877,SECTION LXIII.,"who is the instrumental of this work, for that best of monkeys hath in"
17878,SECTION LXIII.,"him a high intellect, knoweth the art of success, is gifted with"
17879,SECTION LXIII.,"courage, strength and prowess and is conversant with Sastras. That work"
17880,SECTION LXIII.,is sure to succeed whose leading spirits are the mighty Jambavāna and
17881,SECTION LXIII.,"Angada, and worker is Hanumān. Forsooth that orchard hath been laid"
17882,SECTION LXIII.,waste by these heroes headed by Angada. And ransacking the southern
17883,SECTION LXIII.,"quarter, those leading monkeys have come back and delightedly entered"
17884,SECTION LXIII.,the _Madhuvana_. And the whole orchard has been explored and enjoyed by
17885,SECTION LXIII.,those monkeys and the attendants beaten and wounded on their
17886,SECTION LXIII.,"knee-joints. To communicate unto me this intelligence, this monkey of"
17887,SECTION LXIII.,"known prowess, and sweet accents, named Dhadimukha, hath come here. O"
17888,SECTION LXIII.,"thou of mighty arms, O son of Sumitrā, forsooth they have beheld Sitā,"
17889,SECTION LXIII.,"since the monkeys, just on their return, have engaged in drinking honey."
17890,SECTION LXIII.,"O best of men, they are all well-known monkeys and without espying"
17891,SECTION LXIII.,Vaidehi they would not have engaged in the destruction of that orchard

17901,SECTION LXIII.,"Hanumān, and proud like lions, what they have settled for the regaining"

17917,SECTION LXIV.,And entering that forest he beheld all the leaders of the monkeys
17918,SECTION LXIV.,"spending the hours delightedly, having passed urine, the outcome of"

17920,SECTION LXIV.,"addressed Angada, with the following words—""O gentle one, do thou not"
17921,SECTION LXIV.,"take offence, for these monkeys, protecting the garden enraged,"
17922,SECTION LXIV.,"unweetingly prevented thee. O thou of great strength, thou art worn out"
17923,SECTION LXIV.,"with thy long journey, do thou drink thy own honey, thou art our prince"
17924,SECTION LXIV.,and the master of this garden. It behoveth thee to forgive us for our
17925,SECTION LXIV.,"wrath arising out of ignorance. Like unto thy sire before, thyself and"
17926,SECTION LXIV.,"Sugriva are the lords of these monkey hosts, O thou foremost of them,"
17927,SECTION LXIV.,"and none else. O innocent prince, I have related all about this unto thy"

17929,SECTION LXIV.,"rangers, as well as of thine accompanied by them, and the destruction of"
17930,SECTION LXIV.,"this garden by you all, he was not the least offended, rather delighted."
17931,SECTION LXIV.,"And worked up with joy thy uncle Sugriva, the lord of earth and monkeys,"

17934,SECTION LXIV.,"them all, saying—""O ye leaders of the monkey hosts, I fear, Rāma hath"

17936,SECTION LXIV.,"infer this. And our work finished, O slayer of foes, it doth not behove"
17937,SECTION LXIV.,us to remain here (any longer). You have all drunk honey at your
17938,SECTION LXIV.,pleasure and there is nothing left and you should now go where the
17939,SECTION LXIV.,"monkey king Sugriva is. O leading monkeys, I shall follow what you will"
17940,SECTION LXIV.,in a band desire me to do. In actions I am surbordinate unto you all. I
17941,SECTION LXIV.,am not justified to command although I am a prince. You are all of
17942,SECTION LXIV.,"accomplished actions, it is not proper to repress you forcibly. """
17943,SECTION LXIV.,"Hearing those sweet words of the prince Angada, the monkeys delightedly"
17944,SECTION LXIV.,"replied, saying—""O king, O foremost of monkeys, who else can speak thus"
17945,SECTION LXIV.,"being a master? Any one else, we think, is proud of his wealth. Such"
17946,SECTION LXIV.,like words become thee only and none else. Thy humility speaks of thy
17947,SECTION LXIV.,"future greatness. We are all anxious to go there, where Sugriva, the"
17948,SECTION LXIV.,"king of the monkeys, is. Verily we speak unto thee, O foremost of"
17949,SECTION LXIV.,"monkeys, that without thy permission, none amongst us, is capable of"
17950,SECTION LXIV.,"advancing a single step."" They addressing him thus, Angada replied—""All"
17951,SECTION LXIV.,"right, let us all go."" Saying this he leaped up in the sky and was"
17952,SECTION LXIV.,"followed by all those monkeys, clouding the welkin as if with stones"
17953,SECTION LXIV.,"thrown up by a tool. And placing before them Angada and Hanumān, the"
17954,SECTION LXIV.,monkeys leaping vehemently up in the sky roared like unto clouds driven
17955,SECTION LXIV.,"by the wind. And Angada nearing, Sugriva, the lord of the monkeys, spoke"
17956,SECTION LXIV.,"unto the lotus-eyed Rāma, stricken with grief, saying—""May good betide"
17957,SECTION LXIV.,thee. Do thou console thyself. The worshipful dame has been found out;
17958,SECTION LXIV.,there is not the least doubt about it. Or else they would not have come
17959,SECTION LXIV.,as the time is already past. I (further more) infer this from Angada’s
17960,SECTION LXIV.,"joy, O thou of auspicious presence. Without being successful in his"
17961,SECTION LXIV.,"mission, the large-armed prince, Angada, the foremost of the monkeys,"
17962,SECTION LXIV.,would not have come to me. If the monkeys had engaged in such an unfair
17963,SECTION LXIV.,"proceeding without being successful in their mission, Angada would have"
17964,SECTION LXIV.,looked poorly and his mind would have been over-whelmed with grief and
17965,SECTION LXIV.,forgetfulness. And without beholding the daughter of the king Janaka
17966,SECTION LXIV.,they would not have dared to destroy _Madhuvana_ obtained and preserved
17967,SECTION LXIV.,"by my forefathers. Do thou console thyself, O Rāma, by whom Kauçalyā"
17968,SECTION LXIV.,"hath become the mother of a good son. O thou, rigidly observing any"
17969,SECTION LXIV.,"religious vow or obligation, forsooth hath Hanumān beheld the worshipful"
17970,SECTION LXIV.,dame and none else. No other wight is so qualified an instrument in
17971,SECTION LXIV.,"encompassing this end. O thou of excellent intellect, Hanumān knoweth"
17972,SECTION LXIV.,"the art of success, is gifted with intellect, perseverance and courage"
17973,SECTION LXIV.,"and is versed in _Sastras_. That work cannot fail, which is worked out"
17974,SECTION LXIV.,by Jambavān and Angada and presided over by Hanumān. Be not laden with
17975,SECTION LXIV.,"anxiety, O thou of unmitigated prowess. These monkeys have come here"
17976,SECTION LXIV.,excited with pride and drink. They would not have come with such a
17977,SECTION LXIV.,grandeur had they been but unsuccessful. From their breaking down the
17978,SECTION LXIV.,orchard and drinking honey I inferred so. Thereupon he heard in the sky

17989,SECTION LXIV.,"thus by the Wind-god’s son, Lakshmana, greatly pleased, respectfully"
17990,SECTION LXIV.,"looked towards Sugriva. And Rāghava too, the slayer of foes, worked up"

18009,SECTION LXV.,"him. Hearing their words, Hanumān, the Wind-god’s son, versed in the art"

18011,SECTION LXV.,direction (where she liveth) began to relate how he succeeded in
18012,SECTION LXV.,beholding Sitā. And conferring on (Rāma) the heavenly jewel set on a
18013,SECTION LXV.,"golden leaf and burning with its own effulgence, Hanumān, with folded"
18014,SECTION LXV.,"hands, began—""Anxious to behold Sitā, the daughter of the king Janaka,"

18016,SECTION LXV.,"way and by and by reached Lankā, the capital of the vicious-souled"

18021,SECTION LXV.,"the grim-visaged Rākshasees. And that worshipful dame, O hero, ever used"

18034,SECTION LXV.,"O thou best of men, I beheld the daughter of Janaka in this plight,"
18035,SECTION LXV.,engaged in hard austerities and ever devoted unto thee. O thou of great
18036,SECTION LXV.,"intelligence, O Rāghava, offering me (this jewel) as a token, she wanted"
18037,SECTION LXV.,"me to relate unto thee, the occurrence at the mount _chitrakuta_"
18038,SECTION LXV.,"regarding the crow. And Jānaki addressing me said—’O Wind-god’s son, do"

18121,SECTION LXVII.,"Daçaratha, that crow, bidding adieu, went to its quarter. O Rāghava,"
18122,SECTION LXVII.,"thou art the foremost of those skilled in the use of weapons, powerful"
18123,SECTION LXVII.,"and gifted with an excellent character, why dost thou not discharge"
18124,SECTION LXVII.,"weapons towards the Rākshasas? The celestials, the Gandharvas, the"
18125,SECTION LXVII.,"Asuras, the Marutas—none of them is qualified, O Rāma, to equal thee in"
18126,SECTION LXVII.,"conflict. If thou, gifted with great prowess, hast any affection for me,"
18127,SECTION LXVII.,"do thou speedily, with well-armed shafts, destroy Rāvana in conflict."
18128,SECTION LXVII.,"And obtaining the behests of his brother, why doth not Lakshmana, the"
18129,SECTION LXVII.,"subduer of foes and best of men, protect me, O Rāghava? Those two best"
18130,SECTION LXVII.,"of men, gifted with the effulgence of Wind and Fire, and incapable of"
18131,SECTION LXVII.,"being repressed even by the celestials, are disregarding me. Forsooth"
18132,SECTION LXVII.,"have I perpetrated a mighty iniquity since those two slayers of foes,"
18133,SECTION LXVII.,"being capable, do not protect me.’ Hearing those sweet and piteous"
18134,SECTION LXVII.,"accents of Vaidehi I again spoke unto that worshipful dame,"
18135,SECTION LXVII.,"saying—’Forsooth can I swear by thee, O worshipful dame, that Rāma is"
18136,SECTION LXVII.,sorely stricken with grief in thy absence. And Lakshmana too relenteth
18137,SECTION LXVII.,heavily beholding him laden with sorrow. It doth not behove thee to
18138,SECTION LXVII.,relent any more as I have succeeded in finding thee out. Thou shalt at
18139,SECTION LXVII.,"this very moment behold the end of thy grief. And those two princes, the"
18140,SECTION LXVII.,"foremost of men and slayers of foes, actuated with energy on hearing"
18141,SECTION LXVII.,"that I have seen thee, shall reduce Lankā to ashes. And slaying in"
18142,SECTION LXVII.,"conflict the terrible Rāvana, with his kith and kin, Rāghava, in sooth,"
18143,SECTION LXVII.,"O excellent damsel, shall take thee back to his own city. O thou of a"
18144,SECTION LXVII.,"blameless person, do thou confer on me such a token, as might be"
18145,SECTION LXVII.,"recognized by Rāma and conduce to his pleasure.’ Thereat, casting her"
18146,SECTION LXVII.,"looks around, she took out an excellent jewel from her cloth, worthy of"
18147,SECTION LXVII.,"being set on her braid and conferred it on me, O thou of great strength."
18148,SECTION LXVII.,"And O thou, the most favourite of the Raghu race, taking for thee that"
18149,SECTION LXVII.,"gem with my hands and bowing unto her, I addressed myself speedily for"
18150,SECTION LXVII.,departure. And thereupon beholding me ready to depart and increase in
18151,SECTION LXVII.,"bulk and about to leap up in the welkin, Sitā, the daughter of the king"
18152,SECTION LXVII.,"Janaka, poorly, bathed in tears, overwhelmed with sorrow and having her"
18153,SECTION LXVII.,"voice choked with grief, spake, saying—’Blessed art thou O great monkey,"
18154,SECTION LXVII.,since thou shalt behold the large-armed and the lotus-eyed Rāma and the
18155,SECTION LXVII.,"highly famed Lakshmana, my lord’s younger brother.’ And being thus"
18156,SECTION LXVII.,"accosted by Maithili, I said—’Do thou speedily place thyself on my back,"
18157,SECTION LXVII.,"O worshipful dame, O thou the daughter of king Janaka, and I shall soon"
18158,SECTION LXVII.,"show thee, O great dame, O thou having dark blue eyes, thy lord along"
18159,SECTION LXVII.,with Sugriva and Lakshmana.’ Whereto she replied—’This is not the pious
18160,SECTION LXVII.,"course, O great monkey, O thou the foremost of thy race, that I shall,"
18161,SECTION LXVII.,"of my own accord, place myself on thy back. And although before this I"
18162,SECTION LXVII.,"was touched by the demon, O hero, it was because I could not help"
18163,SECTION LXVII.,"otherwise subject as I was to circumstances. Do thou thyself repair, O"
18164,SECTION LXVII.,"foremost of monkeys, where those two princes are.’ Addressing me with"
18165,SECTION LXVII.,"these words she again said—’O Hanumān, do thou relate my well-being unto"
18166,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāma and Lakshmana of leonine prowess, and Sugriva accompanied by his"
18167,SECTION LXVII.,followers. Do thou so describe as the large-armed Rāghava may save me
18168,SECTION LXVII.,from this ocean of grief. Do thou narrate unto Rāma this my terrible
18169,SECTION LXVII.,"sorrow and the affliction by the she-demons. May good betide thee, on"
18170,SECTION LXVII.,"thy way, O foremost of the monkeys.’ Thus the worshipful Sitā gave vent"
18171,SECTION LXVII.,to these piteous accents. Hearing these words do thou believe that it is
18172,SECTION LXVII.,"all well with her."""
18173,SECTION LXVII.,
18174,SECTION LXVII.,"Whereupon, O foremost of men, out of thy love and adoring me for thy"
18175,SECTION LXVII.,"friendship, that worshipful dame— addressed me again, saying—""Do thou"
18176,SECTION LXVII.,"thus speak every thing unto Rāma, the son of Daçaratha, so that he might"
18177,SECTION LXVII.,"soon take me hence, slaying Rāvana in battle. O heroe, O slayer of foes,"
18178,SECTION LXVII.,"if it pleaseth thee, thou mayst relieve thyself of the toil by living in"
18179,SECTION LXVII.,"a secret nook and then proceed to-morrow. O monkey, in thy company, I do"
18180,SECTION LXVII.,"momentarily forget the weight of my grief, unfortunate as I am. O thou"
18181,SECTION LXVII.,"gifted with great prowess, thyself departing, I shall wait for thy"
18182,SECTION LXVII.,"return, but doubt I very much whether I shall live till then. Burnt I"
18183,SECTION LXVII.,"shall be with the fear of not beholding thee again, wretched and striken"
18184,SECTION LXVII.,"with grief as I am. And so I shall be, hereafter, overwhelmed with a"
18185,SECTION LXVII.,"mightier grief. O hero, besides, I entertain a grave doubt about thy"
18186,SECTION LXVII.,"assistants, the monkeys and bears. I do not know how shall the host of"
18187,SECTION LXVII.,monkeys and bears and those two princes cross over the mighty main? O
18188,SECTION LXVII.,innocent monkey of all the creatures three only are qualified to cross
18189,SECTION LXVII.,"over the ocean, thyself, Garuda and the Wind. O thou foremost of those"
18190,SECTION LXVII.,"skilled in speech, what hast thou settled about the accomplishment of"
18191,SECTION LXVII.,this hard work? True it is that thou art alone qualified to accomplish
18192,SECTION LXVII.,"this work, O thou the slayer of inimical heroes—but such manifestation"
18193,SECTION LXVII.,"of thy prowess shall increase thy glory only. But if Rāma, obtaining"
18194,SECTION LXVII.,"victory, can take me hence to his own city, it shall redound to his"
18195,SECTION LXVII.,"glory. It doth not behove the heroic Rāghava, to take me away by"
18196,SECTION LXVII.,"stealth, like unto Rāvana capturing me from the forest under a disguise."
18197,SECTION LXVII.,"Truly it shall be his becoming work, if Kākutstha, the repressor of"
18198,SECTION LXVII.,"enemy’s host, can take me away, enveloping the city Lankā with his army."
18199,SECTION LXVII.,Do thou therefore initiate that work as becometh that high-souled hero
18200,SECTION LXVII.,"and may display his prowess."" Hearing these sound reasonable and"
18201,SECTION LXVII.,"affectionate words I gave her the last reply, saying—’O worshipful dame,"
18202,SECTION LXVII.,"Sugriva, the foremost of the monkeys, the lord of monkey and bear hosts"
18203,SECTION LXVII.,"and gifted with manliness, hath resolved upon rescuing thee. He hath"
18204,SECTION LXVII.,under his command a number of mighty and courageous monkeys gifted with
18205,SECTION LXVII.,great prowess and quick-coursing like imagination. Their course is never
18206,SECTION LXVII.,thwarted—whether going upwards or downwards—or moving tortuously. They
18207,SECTION LXVII.,are never exhausted in their actions— highly courageous and of
18208,SECTION LXVII.,"measureless prowess. And those great and powerful monkeys, coursing in"
18209,SECTION LXVII.,"the air, have again and again circumambulated the earth. Sugriva hath"
18210,SECTION LXVII.,"many monkeys—my equal—and greater than I, but none of inferior strength."
18211,SECTION LXVII.,While I have crossed over the main—what of these mighty heroes? The
18212,SECTION LXVII.,leading heroes are never sent on a mission but only those of inferior
18213,SECTION LXVII.,"merit. No more of bewailing, O worshipful dame. Do thou remove thy"
18214,SECTION LXVII.,grief. And with one leap these leaders of monkey-hosts shall reach
18215,SECTION LXVII.,"Lankā. O great damsel, these two princes, placing themselves on my back"
18216,SECTION LXVII.,shall come to thee like unto the rising Sun and Moon. Thou shalt soon
18217,SECTION LXVII.,behold before Lankā’s gate Rāghava the slayer of foes resembling a lion
18218,SECTION LXVII.,and Lakshmana with a bow in his hand. And thou shalt soon observe in a
18219,SECTION LXVII.,"band the heroic monkeys, gifted with the strength of lions and tigers,"
18220,SECTION LXVII.,and having nails and teeth for their weapons. And thou shalt soon hear
18221,SECTION LXVII.,"the roaring of the leading monkeys on the summit of mount Malaya,"
18222,SECTION LXVII.,resembling the muttering of the clouds. And thou shalt soon behold
18223,SECTION LXVII.,"Rāghava, the slayer of foes, installed along with thee on the throne of"
18224,SECTION LXVII.,"Ayodhya after returning from the forest."" And that daughter of the king"
18225,SECTION LXVII.,of Mithilā although heavily laden with sorrow in thy absence was greatly
18226,SECTION LXVII.,comforted and pleased by my auspicious words boding the fulfilment of
18227,SECTION LXVII.,her desire.
