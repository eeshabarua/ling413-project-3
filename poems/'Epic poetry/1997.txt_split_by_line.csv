165,CANTO I.,
166,CANTO I.,
167,CANTO I.,"The glory of Him who moves everything penetrates through the universe,"
168,CANTO I.,and shines in one part more and in another less. In the heaven that
169,CANTO I.,"receives most of its light I have been, and have seen things which he"
170,CANTO I.,who descends from thereabove neither knows how nor is able to recount;
171,CANTO I.,"because, drawing near to its own desire,[1] our understanding enters so"
172,CANTO I.,"deep, that the memory cannot follow. Truly whatever of the Holy Realm I"
173,CANTO I.,could treasure up in my mind shall now be the theme of my song.
174,CANTO I.,
175,CANTO I.,[1] The innate desire of the soul is to attain the vision of God.
176,CANTO I.,
177,CANTO I.,
178,CANTO I.,"O good Apollo, for this last labor make me such a vessel of thy power"
179,CANTO I.,as thou demandest for the gift of the loved laurel.[1] Thus far one
180,CANTO I.,"summit of Parnassus has been enough for me, but now with both[2] I need"
181,CANTO I.,"to enter the remaining, arena. Enter into my breast, and breathe thou"
182,CANTO I.,in such wise as when thou drewest Marsyas from out the sheath of his
183,CANTO I.,"limbs. O divine Power, if thou lend thyself to me so that I may make"
184,CANTO I.,"manifest the image of the Blessed Realm imprinted within my head, thou"
185,CANTO I.,"shalt see me come to thy chosen tree, and crown myself then with those"
186,CANTO I.,"leaves of which the theme and thou will make me worthy. So rarely,"
187,CANTO I.,"Father, are they gathered for triumph or of Caesar or of poet (fault"
188,CANTO I.,"and shame of the human wills), that the Peneian leaf[3] should bring"
189,CANTO I.,"forth joy unto the joyous Delphic deity, whenever it makes any one to"
190,CANTO I.,long for it. Great flame follows a little spark: perhaps after me
191,CANTO I.,"prayer shall be made with better voices, whereto Cyrrha[4] may respond."
192,CANTO I.,
193,CANTO I.,[1] So inspire me in this labor that I may deserve the gift of the
194,CANTO I.,laurel.
195,CANTO I.,
196,CANTO I.,
197,CANTO I.,"[2] The Muses were fabled to dwell on one peak of Parnassus, Apollo on"
198,CANTO I.,the other. At the opening of the preceding parts of his poem Dante has
199,CANTO I.,invoked the Muses only.
200,CANTO I.,
201,CANTO I.,
202,CANTO I.,"[3] Daphne, who was changed to the laurel, was the daughter of Peneus."
203,CANTO I.,
204,CANTO I.,
205,CANTO I.,"[4] Cyrrha, a city sacred to Apollo, not far from the foot of"
206,CANTO I.,"Parnassus, and here used for the name of the god himself."
207,CANTO I.,
208,CANTO I.,
209,CANTO I.,"The lamp of the world rises to mortals through different passages, but"
210,CANTO I.,from that which joins four circles with three crosses it issues with
211,CANTO I.,"better course and conjoined with a better star, and it tempers and"
212,CANTO I.,seals the mundane wax more after its own fashion[1] Almost such a
213,CANTO I.,passage had made morning there and evening here;[2] and there all that
214,CANTO I.,"hemisphere was white, and the other part black, when I saw Beatrice"
215,CANTO I.,"turned upon the left side, and looking into the sun: never did eagle so"
216,CANTO I.,fix himself upon it. And even as a second ray is wont to issue from the
217,CANTO I.,"first, and mount upward again, like a pilgrim who wishes to return;"
218,CANTO I.,"thus of her action, infused through the eyes into my imagination, mine"
219,CANTO I.,"was made, and I fixed my eyes upon the sun beyond our use. Much is"
220,CANTO I.,"allowed there which here is not allowed to our faculties, thanks to the"
221,CANTO I.,"place made for the human race as its proper, abode.[3] Not long did I"
222,CANTO I.,"endure it, nor so little that I did not see it sparkling round about,"
223,CANTO I.,"like iron that issues boiling from the fire. And on a sudden,[4] day"
224,CANTO I.,"seemed to be added to day, as if He who is able had adorned the heaven"
225,CANTO I.,with another sun.
226,CANTO I.,
227,CANTO I.,"[1] In the spring the sun rises from a point on the horizon, where the"
228,CANTO I.,"four great circles, namely, the horizon, the zodiac, theequator, and"
229,CANTO I.,"the equinoctial colure, meet, and, cutting each other, form three"
230,CANTO I.,"crosses. The sun is in the sign of Aries, “a better star,” because the"
231,CANTO I.,"influence of this constellation was supposed to be benignant, and under"
232,CANTO I.,it the earth reclothes itself. It was the season assigned to the
233,CANTO I.,"Creation, and to the Annunciation."
234,CANTO I.,
235,CANTO I.,
236,CANTO I.,"[2] There, in the Earthly Paradise; here, on earth. It is the morning"
237,CANTO I.,"of Thursday, April 123. The hours from the mid-day preceding to this"
238,CANTO I.,dawn are undescribed.
239,CANTO I.,
240,CANTO I.,
241,CANTO I.,"[3] The Earthly Paradise, made for man in his original excellence."
242,CANTO I.,
243,CANTO I.,
244,CANTO I.,"[4] So rapid was his ascent to the sphere of fire, drawn upward by the"
245,CANTO I.,eyes of Beatrice.
246,CANTO I.,
247,CANTO I.,
248,CANTO I.,"Beatrice was standing with her eyes wholly fixed on the eternal wheels,"
249,CANTO I.,and on her I fixed my eyes from thereabove removed. Looking at her I
250,CANTO I.,inwardly became such as Glaucus[1] became on tasting of the herb which
251,CANTO I.,made him consort in the sea of the other gods. Transhumanizing cannot
252,CANTO I.,be signified in words; therefore let the example[2] suffice for him to
253,CANTO I.,whom grace reserves experience. If I was only what of me thou didst the
254,CANTO I.,"last create,[3] O Love that governest the heavens, Thou knowest, who"
255,CANTO I.,"with Thy light didst lift me. When the revolution which Thou, being"
256,CANTO I.,"desired, makest eternal,[4] made me attent unto itself with the harmony"
257,CANTO I.,"which Thou attunest and modulatest, so much of the heaven then seemed"
258,CANTO I.,"to me enkindled by the flame of the sun, that rain or river never made"
259,CANTO I.,so broad a lake.
260,CANTO I.,
261,CANTO I.,[1] A fisherman changed to a sea-god. The story is in Ovid
262,CANTO I.,"(Metamorphoses, xiii.)."
263,CANTO I.,
264,CANTO I.,
265,CANTO I.,"[2] Just cited, of Glauens."
266,CANTO I.,
267,CANTO I.,
268,CANTO I.,"[3] In the twenty-fifth Canto of Purgatory, Dante has said that when"
269,CANTO I.,the articulation of the brain is perfect God breathes into it a new
270,CANTO I.,"spirit, the living soul; and he means here that, like St. Paul caught"
271,CANTO I.,"up into Paradise, he cannot tell “whether in the body or Out of the"
272,CANTO I.,"body.” (2 Corinthians, xii. 3)."
273,CANTO I.,
274,CANTO I.,
275,CANTO I.,[4] The desire to be united with God is the source of the eternal
276,CANTO I.,revolution of the heavens. “The Empyrean . . . is the cause of the most
277,CANTO I.,swift motion of the Primum Mobile. because of the most ardent desire of
278,CANTO I.,every part of the latter to be conjoined with every part of that most
279,CANTO I.,"divine quiet heaven.”—Convito, 14."
280,CANTO I.,
281,CANTO I.,
282,CANTO I.,The novelty of the sound and the great light kindled in me a desire
283,CANTO I.,"concerning their cause, never before felt with such acuteness."
284,CANTO I.,"Whereupon she, who saw me as I see myself, to quiet my perturbed mind"
285,CANTO I.,"opened her mouth, ere I mine to ask, and began, “Thou thyself makest"
286,CANTO I.,"thyself dull with false imagining, so that thou seest not what thou"
287,CANTO I.,"wouldst see, if thou hadst shaken it off. Thou art not on earth, as"
288,CANTO I.,"thou believest; but lightning, flying from its proper site, never ran"
289,CANTO I.,as thou who thereunto[1] returnest.”
290,CANTO I.,
291,CANTO I.,"[1] To thine own proper site,—Heaven, the true home of the soul."
292,CANTO I.,
293,CANTO I.,
294,CANTO I.,If I was divested of my first doubt by these brief little smiled- out
295,CANTO I.,"words, within a new one was I the more enmeshed. And I said, “Already I"
296,CANTO I.,rested content concerning a great wonder; but now I wonder how I can
297,CANTO I.,"transcend these light bodies.” Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,"
298,CANTO I.,"directed her eyes toward me, with that look which a mother turns on her"
299,CANTO I.,"delirious son, and she began, “All things whatsoever have order among"
300,CANTO I.,themselves; and this is the form which makes the universe like to God.
301,CANTO I.,"Here[1] the high creatures[2] see the imprint of the eternal Goodness,"
302,CANTO I.,which is the end for which the aforesaid rule is made. In the order of
303,CANTO I.,"which I speak, all natures are arranged, by diverse lots, more or less"
304,CANTO I.,near to their source;[3] wherefore they are moved to diverse ports
305,CANTO I.,"through the great sea of being, and each one with an instinct given to"
306,CANTO I.,it which may bear it on. This bears the fire upward toward the moon;
307,CANTO I.,this is the motive force in mortal hearts; this binds together and
308,CANTO I.,unites the earth. Nor does this bow shoot forth.[4] Only the created
309,CANTO I.,"things which are outside intelligence, but also those which have"
310,CANTO I.,"understanding and love. The Providence that adjusts all this, with its"
311,CANTO I.,own light makes forever quiet the heaven[5] within which that revolves
312,CANTO I.,"which hath the greatest speed. And thither now, as to a site decreed,"
313,CANTO I.,the virtue of that cord bears us on which directs to a joyful mark
314,CANTO I.,"whatever it shoots. True is it, that as the form often accords not to"
315,CANTO I.,"the intention of the art, because the material is deaf to respond, so"
316,CANTO I.,"the creature sometimes deviates from this course; for it has power,"
317,CANTO I.,"though thus impelled, to incline in another direction (even as the fire"
318,CANTO I.,"of a cloud may be seen to fall[6]), if the first impetus, bent aside by"
319,CANTO I.,"false pleasure, turn it earthwards. Thou shouldst not, if I deem"
320,CANTO I.,"aright, wonder more at thy ascent, than at a stream if from a high"
321,CANTO I.,"mountain it descends to the base. A marvel it would be in thee, if,"
322,CANTO I.,"deprived of hindrance, thou hadst sat below, even as quiet in living"
323,CANTO I.,fire on earth would be.”
324,CANTO I.,
325,CANTO I.,[1] In this order of the universe.
326,CANTO I.,
327,CANTO I.,
328,CANTO I.,"[2] The created beings endowed with souls,—angels and men."
329,CANTO I.,
330,CANTO I.,
331,CANTO I.,"[3] The source of their being, God."
332,CANTO I.,
333,CANTO I.,
334,CANTO I.,[4] This instinct directs to their proper end animate as well as
335,CANTO I.,"inanimate things, as the bow shoots the arrow to its mark."
336,CANTO I.,
337,CANTO I.,
338,CANTO I.,"[5] The Empyrean, within which the Primum Mobile, the first moving"
339,CANTO I.,"heaven, revolves."
340,CANTO I.,
341,CANTO I.,
342,CANTO I.,[6] Contrary to its true nature.

356,CANTO II.,
357,CANTO II.,"O ye, who are in a little bark, desirous to listen, following behind my"
358,CANTO II.,"craft which singing passes on, turn to see again Your shores; put not"
359,CANTO II.,"out upon the deep; for haply losing me, ye would remain astray. The"
360,CANTO II.,"water that I sail was never crossed. Minerva inspires, and Apollo"
361,CANTO II.,"guides me, and nine Muses point out to me the Bears."
362,CANTO II.,
363,CANTO II.,"Ye other few, who have lifted tip your necks be. times to the bread of"
364,CANTO II.,"the Angels, oil which one here subsists, but never becomes sated of it,"
365,CANTO II.,"ye may well put forth your vessel over the salt deep, keeping my wake"
366,CANTO II.,before you on the water which turns smooth again. Those glorious ones
367,CANTO II.,"who passed over to Colchos wondered not as ye shall do, when they saw"
368,CANTO II.,Jason become a ploughman.
369,CANTO II.,
370,CANTO II.,The concreate and perpetual thirst for the deiform realm was bearing us
371,CANTO II.,"on swift almost as ye see the heavens. Beatrice was looking upward, and"
372,CANTO II.,"I upon her, and perhaps in such time as a quarrel[1] rests, and flies,"
373,CANTO II.,"and from the notch is unlocked,[2] I saw myself arrived where a"
374,CANTO II.,"wonderful thing drew my sight to itself; and therefore she, from whom"
375,CANTO II.,"the working of my mind could not be hid, turned toward me, glad as"
376,CANTO II.,"beautiful. “Uplift thy grateful mind to God,” she said to me, “who with"
377,CANTO II.,the first star[3] has conjoined us.”

388,CANTO II.,"It seemed to me that a cloud had covered us, lucid, dense, solid, and"
389,CANTO II.,"polished, like a diamond which the sun had struck. Within itself the"
390,CANTO II.,"eternal pearl had received us, even as water receives a ray of light,"
391,CANTO II.,remaining unbroken. If I was body (and here[1] it is not conceivable
392,CANTO II.,"how one dimension brooked another, which needs must be if body enter"
393,CANTO II.,"body) the desire ought the more to kindle us to see that Essence, in"
394,CANTO II.,which is seen how our nature and God were united. There will be seen
395,CANTO II.,"that which we hold by faith, not demonstrated, but it will be known of"
396,CANTO II.,itself like the first truth which man believes.[2]

414,CANTO II.,"She smiled somewhat, and then she said, “If the opinion of mortals errs"
415,CANTO II.,"where the key of sense unlocks not, surely the shafts of wonder ought"
416,CANTO II.,"not now to pierce thee, since thou seest that the reason following the"
417,CANTO II.,senses has short wings. But tell me what thou thyself thinkest of it.”
418,CANTO II.,"And I, “That which here above appears to us diverse, I believe is"
419,CANTO II.,"caused by rare and dense bodies.” And she, “Surely enough thou shalt"
420,CANTO II.,"see that thy belief is submerged in error, if then listenest well to"
421,CANTO II.,the argument that I shall make against it. The eighth sphere[1]
422,CANTO II.,"displays to you many lights, which may be noted of different aspects in"
423,CANTO II.,"quality and quantity. If rare and dense effected all this,[2] one"
424,CANTO II.,"single virtue, more or less or equally distributed, would be in all."
425,CANTO II.,Different virtues must needs be fruits of formal principles;[3] and by
426,CANTO II.,"thy reckoning, these, all but one, would be destroyed. Further, if"
427,CANTO II.,"rarity were the cause of that darkness of which you ask, either this"
428,CANTO II.,"planet would be thus deficient of its matter through and through, or"
429,CANTO II.,"else as a body distributes the fat and the loan, so this would"
430,CANTO II.,"interchange the leaves in its volume. If the first were the case, it"
431,CANTO II.,"would be manifest in the eclipses of the sun, by the shining through of"
432,CANTO II.,"the light, as when it is poured out upon any other rare body. This is"
433,CANTO II.,"not so; therefore we must look at the other, and if it happen that I"
434,CANTO II.,"quash this other, thy opinion will be falsified. If it be that this"
435,CANTO II.,"rare passes not through,[4] there needs must be a limit, beyond which"
436,CANTO II.,its contrary allows it not to pass further; and thence the ray from
437,CANTO II.,"another body is poured back, just as color returns through a glass"
438,CANTO II.,which hides lead behind itself. Now thou wilt say that the ray shows
439,CANTO II.,"itself dimmer there than in the other parts, by being there reflected"
440,CANTO II.,"from further back. From this objection experiment, which is wont to be"
441,CANTO II.,"the fountain to the streams of your arts, may deliver thee, if ever"
442,CANTO II.,"thou try it. Thou shalt take three mirrors, and set two of them at an"
443,CANTO II.,"equal distance from thee, and let the other, further removed, meet"
444,CANTO II.,"thine eyes between the first two. Turning toward them, cause a light to"
445,CANTO II.,"be placed behind thy back, which may illumine the three mirrors, and"
446,CANTO II.,return to thee thrown back front all. Although the more distant image
447,CANTO II.,"reach thee not so great in quantity, thou wilt then see how it cannot"

482,CANTO II.,"by various differences, dispose the distinctions which they have within"
483,CANTO II.,themselves unto their ends and their seeds.[4] These organs of the

487,CANTO II.,thou mayest know to keep the ford alone. The motion and the virtue of
488,CANTO II.,"the holy spheres must needs be inspired by blessed motors, as the work"
489,CANTO II.,"of the hammer by the smith. And the heaven, which so many lights make"
490,CANTO II.,"beautiful, takes its image from the deep Mind which revolves it, and"
491,CANTO II.,makes thereof a seal. And as the soul within your dust is diffused
492,CANTO II.,"through different members, and conformed to divers potencies, so the"
493,CANTO II.,"Intelligence[5] displays its own goodness multiplied through the stars,"
494,CANTO II.,itself circling upon its own unity. Divers virtue makes divers alloy
495,CANTO II.,"with the precious body that it quickens, in which, even as life in you,"
496,CANTO II.,"it is bound. Because of the glad nature whence, it flows, the virtue"
497,CANTO II.,"mingled through the body shines,[6] as gladness through the living"

568,CANTO III.,"untasted never is understood, it will be gracious to me, if thou"

570,CANTO III.,"promptly, and with smiling eyes, “Our charity locks not its door to a"

578,CANTO III.,"appears so low, is forsooth given to us, because our vows were"

585,CANTO III.,"those other shades she first smiled a little; then answered me so glad,"
586,CANTO III.,"that she seemed to burn in the first fire of love, “Brother, virtue of"
587,CANTO III.,"charity[4] quiets our will, and makes us wish only for that which we"
588,CANTO III.,"have, and for aught else makes us not thirsty. Should we desire to be"

638,CANTO III.,sacred veils was taken. But after she too was returned unto the world

699,CANTO IV.,
700,CANTO IV.,"[1] Plato, in his Timaeus (41, 42), says that the creator of the"
701,CANTO IV.,"universe assigned each soul to a star, whence they were to be sown in"
702,CANTO IV.,the vessels of time. “ He who lived well during his appointed time was
703,CANTO IV.,"to return to the star which was his habitation, and there he would have"
704,CANTO IV.,a blessed and suitable existence.” Dante's doubt has arisen from the
705,CANTO IV.,"words of Piccarda, which implied that her station was in the sphere of"
706,CANTO IV.,the Moon.
707,CANTO IV.,
708,CANTO IV.,
709,CANTO IV.,[2] The conception that the souls after death had their abode in the
710,CANTO IV.,"stars would be a definite heresy, and hence far more dangerous than a"
711,CANTO IV.,"question concerning the justice of Heaven, for such a question might be"
712,CANTO IV.,consistent with entire faith in that justice.
713,CANTO IV.,
714,CANTO IV.,
715,CANTO IV.,"“Of the Seraphim he who is most in God, Moses, Samuel, and whichever"

717,CANTO IV.,"another heaven than those spirits who just now appeared to thee, nor"
718,CANTO IV.,have they more or fewer years for their existence; but all make
719,CANTO IV.,"beautiful the first circle, and have sweet life in different measure,"
720,CANTO IV.,through feeling more or less the eternal breath.[1] They showed
721,CANTO IV.,"themselves here, not because this sphere is allotted to them, but to"
722,CANTO IV.,afford sign of the celestial condition which is least exalted. To speak
723,CANTO IV.,"thus is befitting to your mind, since only by objects of the sense doth"
724,CANTO IV.,it apprehend that which it then makes worthy of the understanding. For
725,CANTO IV.,"this reason the Scripture condescends to your capacity, and attributes"
726,CANTO IV.,"feet and hands to God, while meaning otherwise; and Holy Church"
727,CANTO IV.,represents to you with human aspect Gabriel and Michael and the other
728,CANTO IV.,"who made Tobias whole again.[2] That which Timaeus, reasons of the"
729,CANTO IV.,"souls is not like this which is seen here, since it seems that he"
730,CANTO IV.,"thinks as he says. He says that the soul returns to its own star,"
731,CANTO IV.,"believing it to have been severed thence, when nature gave it as the"
732,CANTO IV.,form.[3] And perchance his opinion is of other guise than his words
733,CANTO IV.,"sound, and may be of a meaning not to be derided. If he means that the"
734,CANTO IV.,"honor of their influence and the blame returns to these wheels, perhaps"
735,CANTO IV.,"his bow hits on some truth. This principle, ill understood, formerly"
736,CANTO IV.,"turned awry almost the whole world, so that it ran astray in naming"

760,CANTO IV.,iniquity. But in order that your perception may surely penetrate unto
761,CANTO IV.,"this truth, I will make thee content, as thou desirest. Though there be"
762,CANTO IV.,"violence when he who suffers nowise consents to him who compels, these"
763,CANTO IV.,"souls were not by reason of that excused; for will, unless it wills, is"
764,CANTO IV.,"not quenched,[2] but does as nature does in fire, though violence a"
765,CANTO IV.,"thousand times may wrest it. Wherefore if it bend much or little, it"
766,CANTO IV.,"follows the force; and thus these did, having power to return to the"
767,CANTO IV.,"holy place. If their will had been entire, such as held Lawrence on the"
768,CANTO IV.,"gridiron, and made Mucius severe unto his hand, it would have urged"
769,CANTO IV.,"them back, so soon as they were loosed, along the road on which they"
770,CANTO IV.,"had been dragged; but will so firm is too rare. And by these words, if"

776,CANTO IV.,"proofs of faith; as St. Thomas Aquinas says, “The merit of faith"
777,CANTO IV.,"consists in believing what one does not see.” But in this case, as"
778,CANTO IV.,"Beatrice goes on to show, mere human intelligence if Sufficient to see"

787,CANTO IV.,thyself thou wouldst not issue forth therefrom ere thou wert weary. I
788,CANTO IV.,"have put it in thy mind for certain, that a soul in bliss cannot lie,"
789,CANTO IV.,since it is always near to the Primal Truth; and then thou hast heard
790,CANTO IV.,from Piccarda that Constance retained affection for the veil; so that
791,CANTO IV.,"she seems in this to contradict me. Often ere now, brother, has it"
792,CANTO IV.,"happened that, in order to escape peril, that which it was not meet to"
793,CANTO IV.,do has been done against one's liking; even as Alcmaeon (who thereto
794,CANTO IV.,"entreated by his father, slew his own mother), not to lose piety,"
795,CANTO IV.,"pitiless became. On this point, I wish thee to think that the violence"
796,CANTO IV.,"is mingled with the will, and they so act that the offences cannot be"
797,CANTO IV.,excused. Absolute will consents not to the wrong; but the will in so
798,CANTO IV.,"far consents thereto, as it fears, if it draw back, to fall into"
799,CANTO IV.,"greater trouble. Therefore when Piccarda says that, she means it of the"
800,CANTO IV.,absolute will; and I of the other so that we both speak truth alike.”
801,CANTO IV.,
802,CANTO IV.,Such was the current of the holy stream which issued from the fount

809,CANTO IV.,"grace for grace, but may He who sees and can, respond for this. I"
810,CANTO IV.,clearly see that our intellect is never satisfied unless the Truth
811,CANTO IV.,"illume it, outside of which no truth extends. In that it reposes, as a"
812,CANTO IV.,"wild beast in his lair, soon as it has reached it: and it can reach it;"
813,CANTO IV.,"otherwise every desire would be in vain. Because of this,[1] the doubt,"
814,CANTO IV.,"in likeness of a shoot, springs up at the foot of the truth; and it is"
815,CANTO IV.,nature which urges us to the summit from height to height. This[2]
816,CANTO IV.,"invites me, this gives me assurance, Lady, with reverence to ask you of"
817,CANTO IV.,another truth which is obscure to me. I wish to know if man can make
818,CANTO IV.,"satisfaction to you[3] for defective vows with other goods, so that in"

864,CANTO V.,"man, sacrifice is made of this treasure, which is such as I say, and it"
865,CANTO V.,is made by its own act. What then can be rendered in compensation? If

884,CANTO V.,“Two things combine in the essence of this sacrifice; the one is that
885,CANTO V.,"of which it consists, the other is the covenant. This last is never"
886,CANTO V.,cancelled if it be not kept; and concerning this has my preceding
887,CANTO V.,speech been so precise. On this account it was necessary for the
888,CANTO V.,"Hebrews still to make offering, although some part of the offering"
889,CANTO V.,"might be changed, as thou shouldst know.[1] The other, which as the"
890,CANTO V.,"matter[2] is known to thee, may truly be such that one errs not if for"

1229,CANTO VII.,"error, till it pleased the Word of God to descend where He, by the sole"
1230,CANTO VII.,"act of His eternal love, united with Himself in person the nature which"

1234,CANTO VII.,"united with its Maker, became sincere and good, as it had been created;"
1235,CANTO VII.,"but by itself it had been banished from Paradise, because it turned"
1236,CANTO VII.,aside from the way of truth and from its own life. The punishment
1237,CANTO VII.,"therefore which the cross afforded, if it be measured by the nature"
1238,CANTO VII.,"assumed, none ever so justly stung; and, likewise, none was ever of"
1239,CANTO VII.,"such great wrong, regarding the Person who suffered, with whom this"
1240,CANTO VII.,nature was united. Therefore from one act issued things diverse; for
1241,CANTO VII.,unto God and unto the Jews one death was pleasing: by it earth trembled
1242,CANTO VII.,and the heavens were opened. No more henceforth ought it to seem
1243,CANTO VII.,"perplexing to thee, when it is said that a just vengeance was afterward"
1244,CANTO VII.,"avenged by a just court,"
1245,CANTO VII.,
1246,CANTO VII.,"“But I see now thy mind tied up, from thought to thought, within a knot"

1249,CANTO VII.,"should will only this mode for our redemption.' This decree, brother,"
1250,CANTO VII.,stands buried to the eyes of every one whose wit is not full grown in
1251,CANTO VII.,"the flame of love. Truly, inasmuch as on this mark there is much"
1252,CANTO VII.,"gazing, and little is discerned, I will tell why such mode was most"
1253,CANTO VII.,"worthy. The Divine Goodness, which from Itself spurns all rancor,"
1254,CANTO VII.,burning in Itself so sparkles that It displays the eternal beauties.
1255,CANTO VII.,"That which distils immediately[1] from It, thereafter has no end, for"
1256,CANTO VII.,"when It seals, Its imprint is not removed. That which from It"
1257,CANTO VII.,"immediately rains down is wholly free, because it is not subject unto"
1258,CANTO VII.,"the power of the new things.[2] It is the most conformed to It, and"
1259,CANTO VII.,therefore pleases It the most; for the Holy Ardor which irradiates
1260,CANTO VII.,every thing is most living in what is most resemblance to Itself. With
1261,CANTO VII.,"all these things[3] the human creature is advantaged, and if one fail,"
1262,CANTO VII.,he needs must fall from his nobility. Sin alone is that which
1263,CANTO VII.,"disfranchises him, and makes him unlike the Supreme Good, so that by"
1264,CANTO VII.,"Its light he is little illumined. And to his dignity he never returns,"
1265,CANTO VII.,"unless, where sin makes void, he fill up for evil pleasures with just"
1266,CANTO VII.,"penalties. Your nature, when it sinned totally in its seed,[4] was"
1267,CANTO VII.,"removed from these dignities, even as from Paradise; nor could they be"
1268,CANTO VII.,"recovered, if thou considerest full subtly, by any way, without passing"
1269,CANTO VII.,by one of these fords:—either that God alone by His courtesy should
1270,CANTO VII.,"forgive, or that man by himself should make satisfaction for his folly."
1271,CANTO VII.,"Fix now thine eye within the abyss of the eternal counsel, fixed as"
1272,CANTO VII.,closely on my speech as thou art able. Man within his own limits could
1273,CANTO VII.,"never make satisfaction, through not being able to descend so far with"
1274,CANTO VII.,"humility in subsequent obedience, as disobeying he intended to ascend;"
1275,CANTO VII.,and this is the reason why man was excluded from power to make
1276,CANTO VII.,satisfaction by himself. Therefore it behoved God by His own paths[5]
1277,CANTO VII.,"to restore man to his entire life, I mean by one, or else by both. But"
1278,CANTO VII.,"because the work of the workman is so much the more pleasing, the more"
1279,CANTO VII.,"it represents of the goodness of the heart whence it issues, the Divine"
1280,CANTO VII.,Goodness which imprints the world was content to proceed by all Its
1281,CANTO VII.,paths to lift you up again; nor between the last night and the first
1282,CANTO VII.,day has there been or will there be so lofty and so magnificent a
1283,CANTO VII.,procedure either by one or by the other; for God was more liberal in
1284,CANTO VII.,"giving Himself to make man sufficient to lift himself up again, than if"
1285,CANTO VII.,only of Himself He had pardoned him. And all the other modes were
1286,CANTO VII.,"scanty in respect to justice, if the Son of God had not humbled himself"

1493,CANTO VIII.,"I see it in myself, it is the more grateful to me; and this also I hold"
1494,CANTO VIII.,"dear, that thou discernest it, gazing upon God.[2] Thou hast made me"
1495,CANTO VIII.,glad; and in like wise do thou make clear to me (since in speaking thou
1496,CANTO VIII.,bast moved me to doubt) how bitter can issue from sweet seed.” This I
1497,CANTO VIII.,"to him; and he to me, “If I am able to show to thee a truth, thou wilt"
1498,CANTO VIII.,"hold thy face to that which thou askest, as thou dost hold thy back."
1499,CANTO VIII.,"The Good which turns and contents all the realm which thou ascendest,"
1500,CANTO VIII.,makes its providence to be a power in these great bodies.[3] And not
1501,CANTO VIII.,"the natures only are foreseen in the Mind which by itself is perfect,"
1502,CANTO VIII.,but they together with their salvation.[4] For whatsoever this bow
1503,CANTO VIII.,"shoots falls disposed to its foreseen end, even as a thing directed to"
1504,CANTO VIII.,"its aim. Were this not so, the heavens through which thou journeyest"
1505,CANTO VIII.,would produce their effects in such wise that they would not be works
1506,CANTO VIII.,"of art but ruins; and that cannot be, if the Intelligences which move"
1507,CANTO VIII.,"these stars are not defective, and defective also the prime"
1508,CANTO VIII.,Intelligence which has not made them perfect.[5] Dost thou wish that
1509,CANTO VIII.,"this truth be made still clearer to thee?” And I, “No, truly; because I"
1510,CANTO VIII.,see it to be impossible that Nature should weary in that which is
1511,CANTO VIII.,"needful.”[6] Whereupon he again, “Now say, would it be worse for man on"
1512,CANTO VIII.,"earth if he were not a citizen?”[7] “Yes,” answered I, “and here I ask"
1513,CANTO VIII.,"not the reason.”[8] “And can he be so, unless he live there below in"
1514,CANTO VIII.,divers manner through divers offices?[9] No; if your master[10] writes
1515,CANTO VIII.,"well of this.” So he went on deducing far as here; then he concluded,"
1516,CANTO VIII.,“Hence it behoves that the roots of your works must be diverse.[11]
1517,CANTO VIII.,"Wherefore one is born Solon, and another Xerxes, another Melchisedech,"
1518,CANTO VIII.,"and another he who, flying through the air, lost his son. The revolving"
1519,CANTO VIII.,"nature, which is the seal of the mortal wax, performs its art well, but"
1520,CANTO VIII.,does not distinguish one inn from another.[12] Hence it happens that
1521,CANTO VIII.,"Esau differs in seed from Jacob, and Quirinus comes from so mean a"
1522,CANTO VIII.,father that he is ascribed to Mars. The generated nature would always
1523,CANTO VIII.,"make its path like its progenitors, if the divine foresight did not"
1524,CANTO VIII.,"conquer. Now that which was behind thee is before thee, but that thou"
1525,CANTO VIII.,"mayest know that I have joy in thee, I wish that thou cloak thee with a"
1526,CANTO VIII.,"corollary.[13] Nature, if she find fortune discordant with herself,"
1527,CANTO VIII.,"like every other seed out of its region, always makes bad result. And"
1528,CANTO VIII.,if the world down there would fix attention on the foundation which
1529,CANTO VIII.,"nature lays, following that, it would have its people good. But ye"
1530,CANTO VIII.,"wrest to religion one who shall be born to gird on the sword, and ye"
1531,CANTO VIII.,make a king of one who is for preaching; wherefore your track is out of
1532,CANTO VIII.,the road.”

1535,CANTO VIII.,

2592,CANTO XIII.,to have was all infused. by that Power which made one and the other;
2593,CANTO XIII.,"and therefore thou wonderest at that which I said above, when I told"
2594,CANTO XIII.,that the good which in the fifth light is inclosed had no second. Now
2595,CANTO XIII.,"open thine eyes to that which I answer to thee, and thou wilt see thy"
2596,CANTO XIII.,belief and my speech become in the truth as the centre in a circle.
2597,CANTO XIII.,
2598,CANTO XIII.,“That which dies not and that which can die are naught but the splendor
2599,CANTO XIII.,of that idea which in His love our Lord God brings to birth;[1] for
2600,CANTO XIII.,that living Light which so proceeds from its Lucent Source that It is
2601,CANTO XIII.,"not disunited from It, nor from the Love which with them is intrined,"
2602,CANTO XIII.,"through Its own bounty collects Its radiance, as it were mirrored, in"
2603,CANTO XIII.,"nine subsistences, Itself eternally remaining one. Thence It descends"
2604,CANTO XIII.,"to the ultimate potentialities, downward from act to act, becoming such"
2605,CANTO XIII.,that finally It makes naught save brief contingencies: and these
2606,CANTO XIII.,contingencies I understand. to be the generated things which the
2607,CANTO XIII.,heavens in their motion produce with seed and without.[2] The wax of
2608,CANTO XIII.,"these, and that which moulds it, are not of one mode, and therefore"
2609,CANTO XIII.,under the ideal stamp it shines now more now less;[3] whence it comes
2610,CANTO XIII.,to pass that one same plant in respect to species bears better or worse
2611,CANTO XIII.,"fruit, and that ye are born with diverse dispositions. If the wax were"
2612,CANTO XIII.,"exactly worked,[4] and the heavens were supreme in their power, the"
2613,CANTO XIII.,whole light of the seal would be apparent. But nature always gives it
2614,CANTO XIII.,"defective,[5] working like the artist who has the practice of his art"
2615,CANTO XIII.,and a hand that trembles. Nevertheless if the fervent Love disposes and
2616,CANTO XIII.,"imprints the clear Light of the primal Power, complete perfection is"
2617,CANTO XIII.,acquired here.[6] Thus of old the earth was made worthy of the complete
2618,CANTO XIII.,perfection of the living being;[7] thus was the Virgin made
2619,CANTO XIII.,impregnate;[8] so that I commend thy opinion that human nature never
2620,CANTO XIII.,"was, nor will be, what it was in those two persons."
2621,CANTO XIII.,
2622,CANTO XIII.,[1] The creation of things eternal and things temporal alike is the
2623,CANTO XIII.,"splendid manifestation of the idea which the triune God, in His love,"
2624,CANTO XIII.,"generated. The living light in the Son, emanating from its lucent"
2625,CANTO XIII.,"source in the Father, in union with the love of the Holy Spirit, the"
2626,CANTO XIII.,"three remaining always one, pours out its radiance through the nine"
2627,CANTO XIII.,"orders of the Angelic Hierarchy, who distribute it by means of the"
2628,CANTO XIII.,Heavens of which they axe the Intelligences.
2629,CANTO XIII.,
2630,CANTO XIII.,
2631,CANTO XIII.,"[2] Through the various movements and conjunctions of the Heavens, the"
2632,CANTO XIII.,"creative light descends to the lowest elements, producing all the"
2633,CANTO XIII.,varieties of contingent things.
2634,CANTO XIII.,
2635,CANTO XIII.,
2636,CANTO XIII.,"[3] The material of contingent or temporal things, and the influences"
2637,CANTO XIII.,"which shape them, are of various sort, so that the splendor of the"
2638,CANTO XIII.,Divine idea is visible in them in different degree.
2639,CANTO XIII.,

2644,CANTO XIII.,"[5] Nature, the second Cause, never transmits the whole of the Creative"
2645,CANTO XIII.,light.
2646,CANTO XIII.,
2647,CANTO XIII.,
2648,CANTO XIII.,"[6] If, however, the first Cause acts directly,—the fervent Love"
2649,CANTO XIII.,"imprinting the clear Light of the primal Power,—there can be no"
2650,CANTO XIII.,imperfection in the created thing; it answers to the Divine idea.
2651,CANTO XIII.,
2652,CANTO XIII.,
2653,CANTO XIII.,"[7] Thus, by the immediate operation of the Creator, the earth of which"
2654,CANTO XIII.,Adam was formed was made the perfect material for the f ormation of the
2655,CANTO XIII.,creature with a living soul.
2656,CANTO XIII.,

2661,CANTO XIII.,"“Now, if I should not proceed further, 'Then how was this man without"
2662,CANTO XIII.,"peer?' would thy words begin. But, in order that that which is not"
2663,CANTO XIII.,"apparent may clearly appear, consider who he was, and the occasion"
2664,CANTO XIII.,"which moved him to request, when it was said to him, 'Ask.' I have not"
2665,CANTO XIII.,"so spoken that thou canst not clearly see that he was a king, who asked"
2666,CANTO XIII.,"for wisdom, in order that he might be a worthy king; not to know the"
2667,CANTO XIII.,"number of the motors here on high, or if necesse with a contingent ever"
2668,CANTO XIII.,"made necesse;[1] non si est dare primum motum esse,[2] or if in the"
2669,CANTO XIII.,semicircle a triangle can be made so that it should not have one right

2671,CANTO XIII.,"prudence is that peerless seeing, on which the arrow of ray intention"
2672,CANTO XIII.,strikes.[4] And if thou directest clear eyes to the 'has arisen' thou
2673,CANTO XIII.,"wilt see it has respect only to kings, who are many, and the good are"
2674,CANTO XIII.,"few. With this distinction[5] take thou my saying, and thus it can"
2675,CANTO XIII.,"stand with that which thou believest of the first father, and of our"
2676,CANTO XIII.,"Delight.[6] And let this be ever as lead to thy feet, to make thee move"
2677,CANTO XIII.,"slow as a weary man, both to the YES and to the NO which thou seest"
2678,CANTO XIII.,not; for he is very low among the fools who affirms or denies without
2679,CANTO XIII.,"distinction, alike in the one and in the other case: because it"
2680,CANTO XIII.,"happens, that oftentimes the current opinion bends in false direction,"
2681,CANTO XIII.,and then the inclination binds the understanding. Far more than vainly
2682,CANTO XIII.,"does he leave the bank, since he returns not such as be sets out, who"
2683,CANTO XIII.,"fishes for the truth, and has not the art;[7] and of this are manifest"
2684,CANTO XIII.,"proofs to the world Parmenides, Melissus, Bryson,[8] and many others"
2685,CANTO XIII.,"who went on and knew not whither. So did Sabellius, and Arius,[9] and"
2686,CANTO XIII.,those fools who were as swords unto the Scriptures in making their
2687,CANTO XIII.,straight faces crooked. Let not the people still be too secure in
2688,CANTO XIII.,"judgment, like him who reckons up the blades in the field ere they are"
2689,CANTO XIII.,ripe. For I have seen the briar first show itself stiff and wild all
2690,CANTO XIII.,"winter long, then bear the rose upon its top. And I have seen a bark"
2691,CANTO XIII.,"ere now ran straight and swift across the sea through all its course,"
2692,CANTO XIII.,to perish at last at entrance of the harbor. Let not dame Bertha and
2693,CANTO XIII.,"master Martin, seeing one rob, and another make offering, believe to"

2774,CANTO XIV.,their turning and in their marvellous melody. Whoso laments because man

2780,CANTO XIV.,thrice sung by each of those spirits with such a melody that for every
2781,CANTO XIV.,merit it would be a just reward. And I heard in the divinest light of
2782,CANTO XIV.,"the small circle a modest voice,[1] perhaps such as was that of the"
2783,CANTO XIV.,"Angel to Mary, make answer, “As long as the festival of Paradise shall"
2784,CANTO XIV.,"be, so long will our love radiate around us such a garment. Its"
2785,CANTO XIV.,"brightness follows our ardor, the ardor our vision, and that is great"
2786,CANTO XIV.,in proportion as it receives of grace above its own worth. When the
2787,CANTO XIV.,"glorious and sanctified flesh shall be put on us again, our persons"
2788,CANTO XIV.,will be more pleasing through being all complete; wherefore whatever of
2789,CANTO XIV.,"gratuitous light the Supreme Good gives us will be increased,—light"
2790,CANTO XIV.,"which enables us to see him; so that our vision needs must increase,"
2791,CANTO XIV.,"our ardor increase which by that is kindled, our radiance increase"
2792,CANTO XIV.,"which comes from this. But even as a coal which gives forth flame, and"
2793,CANTO XIV.,"by a vivid glow surpasses it, so that it defends its own aspect,[2]"
2794,CANTO XIV.,"thus this effulgence, which already encircles us, will be vanquished in"
2795,CANTO XIV.,appearance by the flesh which all this while the earth covers. Nor will
2796,CANTO XIV.,"so great a light be able to fatigue us, for the organs of the body will"
2797,CANTO XIV.,be strong for everything which shall have power to delight us.” So
2798,CANTO XIV.,sudden and ready both one and the other choir seemed to me in saying
2799,CANTO XIV.,"“Amen,” that truly they showed desire for their dead bodies, perhaps"
2800,CANTO XIV.,"not only for themselves, but also for their mothers, for their fathers,"
2801,CANTO XIV.,and for the others who were dear before they became sempiternal flames.

2812,CANTO XIV.,"as at rise of early evening new appearances begin in the heavens, so"
2813,CANTO XIV.,"that the sight seems and seems not true, it seemed to me that there I"
2814,CANTO XIV.,"began to see new subsistences, and a circle forming outside the other"
2815,CANTO XIV.,"two circumferences. O true sparkling of the Holy Spirit, how sudden and"
2816,CANTO XIV.,"glowing it became to mine eyes, which, vanquished, endured it not! But"

2825,CANTO XIV.,"with that speech which is one in all men,[2] I made to God a holocaust"
2826,CANTO XIV.,such as was befitting to the new grace; and the ardor of the sacrifice
2827,CANTO XIV.,was not yet exhausted in my breast when I knew that offering had been
2828,CANTO XIV.,accepted and propitious; for with such great glow and such great
2829,CANTO XIV.,"ruddiness splendors appeared to me within two rays, that I said, “O"

2865,CANTO XIV.,"holy praise, because there came to me “Arise and conquer!” as unto one"

2944,CANTO XV.,"went on, “Grateful and long hunger, derived from reading in the great"
2945,CANTO XV.,"vouime where white or dark is never changed,[1] thou hast relieved, my"
2946,CANTO XV.,"son, within this light in which I speak to thee, thanks to Her who"
2947,CANTO XV.,clothed thee with plumes for the lofty flight. Thou believest that thy
2948,CANTO XV.,"thought flows to me from that which is first; even as from the unit, if"
2949,CANTO XV.,"that be known, ray out the five and six. And therefore who I am, and"
2950,CANTO XV.,"why I appear to thee more joyous than any other in this glad crowd,"
2951,CANTO XV.,thou askest me not. Thou believest the truth; for the less and the
2952,CANTO XV.,"great of this life gaze upon the mirror in which, before thou thinkest,"
2953,CANTO XV.,"thou dost display thy thought. But in order that the sacred Love, in"
2954,CANTO XV.,"which I watch with perpetual sight, and which makes me thirst with"
2955,CANTO XV.,"sweet desire, may be fulfilled the better, let thy voice, secure, bold,"
2956,CANTO XV.,"and glad, utter the wish, utter the desire, to which my answer is"
2957,CANTO XV.,already decreed.”

2959,CANTO XV.,"[1] In the mind of God, in which there is no change."
2960,CANTO XV.,
2961,CANTO XV.,
2962,CANTO XV.,"I turned me to Beatrice, and she heard before I spoke, and smiled to me"
2963,CANTO XV.,a sign which made the wings to my desire grow: and I began thus: “When
2964,CANTO XV.,"the first Equality appeared to you, the affection and the intelligence"
2965,CANTO XV.,became of one weight for each of you; because the Sun which illumined
2966,CANTO XV.,and warmed you is of such equality in its heat and in its light that
2967,CANTO XV.,"all similitudes are defective. But will and discourse in mortals, for"
2968,CANTO XV.,"the reason which is manifest to you, are diversely feathered in their"
2969,CANTO XV.,"wings.[1] Wherefore I, who am mortal, feel myself in this"
2970,CANTO XV.,"inequality,[2] and therefore I give not thanks, save with my heart, for"
2971,CANTO XV.,"thy paternal welcome. Truly I beseech thee, living topaz that dost"
2972,CANTO XV.,"ingem this precious jewel, that thou make me content with thy name?” “O"
2973,CANTO XV.,"leaf of mine, in whom, while only awaiting, I took pleasure, I was thy"
2974,CANTO XV.,"root.” Such a beginning he, answering, made to me. Then he said to me:"
2975,CANTO XV.,"“He from whom thy family is named,[3] and who for a hundred years and"
2976,CANTO XV.,"more has circled the mountain on the first ledge, was my son and was"
2977,CANTO XV.,thy great-grandsire. Truly it behoves that thou shorten for him his
2978,CANTO XV.,"long fatigue with thy works. Florence, within the ancient circle"
2979,CANTO XV.,"wherefrom she still takes both tierce and nones,[4] was abiding in"
2980,CANTO XV.,"sober and modest peace. She had not necklace nor coronal, nor dames"
2981,CANTO XV.,"with ornamented shoes, nor girdle which was more to be looked at than"
2982,CANTO XV.,the person. Not yet did the daughter at her birth cause fear to the
2983,CANTO XV.,"father, for the time and dowry did not evade measure on this side and"
2984,CANTO XV.,that.[5] She had not houses void of families;[6] Sardanapalus had not
2985,CANTO XV.,yet arrived[7] there to show what can be done in a chamber. Not yet by
2986,CANTO XV.,"your Uccellatoio was Montemalo surpassed, which, as it has been"
2987,CANTO XV.,"surpassed in its rise, shall be so in its fall.[8] I saw Bellineoin"
2988,CANTO XV.,"Berti[9] go girt with leather and bone,[10] and his dame come from her"
2989,CANTO XV.,"mirror without a painted face. And I saw them of the Nerli, and them of"
2990,CANTO XV.,"the Vecchio,[11] contented with the uncovered skin,[12] and their dames"
2991,CANTO XV.,with the spindle and the distaff. O fortunate women! Every one was sure
2992,CANTO XV.,of her burial place;[13] and as yet no one was deserted in her bed for
2993,CANTO XV.,"France.[14] One over the cradle kept her careful watch, and,"
2994,CANTO XV.,"comforting, she used the idiom which first amuses fathers and mothers."
2995,CANTO XV.,"Another, drawing the tresses from her distaff, told tales to her"
2996,CANTO XV.,"household of the Trojans, and of Fiesole, and of Rome.[15] A"
2997,CANTO XV.,"Cianghella,[16] a Lapo Salterello would then have been held as great a"

3195,CANTO XVI.,"lawyer named Baldo, “qui fuit magnus canis.” He became one of the"
3196,CANTO XVI.,priors of Florence in 1311. He of Signa is supposed to have been one

3204,CANTO XVI.,"Montemurlo would still belong to its Counts, the Cerchi would be in the"

3215,CANTO XVI.,"covers and uncovers the shores without a pause, so fortune does with"
3216,CANTO XVI.,"Florence. Wherefore what I shall tell of the high Florentines, whose"
3217,CANTO XVI.,"fame is hidden by time, should not appear to thee a marvellous thing. I"
3218,CANTO XVI.,"saw the Ughi, and I saw the Catellini, Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and"
3219,CANTO XVI.,"Alberichi, even in their decline, illustrious citizens; and I saw, as"
3220,CANTO XVI.,"great as they were old, with those of the Sannella, those of the Area,"
3221,CANTO XVI.,"and Soldanieri, and Ardinghi, and Bostiebi.[7] Over the gate which at"
3222,CANTO XVI.,present is laden with new felony[8] of such weight that soon there will
3223,CANTO XVI.,"be jettison from the bark,[9] were the Ravignani, from whom the Count"
3224,CANTO XVI.,"Guido is descended,[10] and whosoever since has taken the name of the"
3225,CANTO XVI.,"high Bellincione. He of the Pressa knew already bow one needs to rule,"
3226,CANTO XVI.,and Galigaio already had in his house the gilded hilt and pummel.[11]
3227,CANTO XVI.,"Great were already the column of the Vair,[12] the Sacchetti, Giuochi,"
3228,CANTO XVI.,"Fifanti, and Barucci, and Galli, and they who blush for the bushel.[13]"
3229,CANTO XVI.,"The stock from which the Calfucci sprang was already great, and already"
3230,CANTO XVI.,the Sizii. and Arrigucci had been drawn to curule chairs.[14] Oh how
3231,CANTO XVI.,great did I see those who have been undone by their pride![15] and the
3232,CANTO XVI.,balls of gold[16] made Florence flourish with all their great deeds. So
3233,CANTO XVI.,"did the fathers of those who always,when your church is vacant, become"
3234,CANTO XVI.,"fat, staying in consistory.[17] The overweening race which is as a"
3235,CANTO XVI.,"dragon behind him who flies, and to him who shows tooth or purse is"
3236,CANTO XVI.,"gentle as a lamb,[18] already was coming up, but from small folk, so"
3237,CANTO XVI.,that it pleased not Ubertin Donato that his father-in-law should
3238,CANTO XVI.,afterwards make him their relation.[19] Already had Caponsacco
3239,CANTO XVI.,"descended into the market place down from Fiesole, and already was"
3240,CANTO XVI.,"Giuda a good citizen, and Infangato.[20] I will tell a thing incredible"
3241,CANTO XVI.,and true: into the little circle one entered by a gate which was named
3242,CANTO XVI.,for those of the Pear.[21] Every one who bears the beautiful ensign of
3243,CANTO XVI.,the great baron[22] whose name and whose praise the feast of Thomas
3244,CANTO XVI.,"revives, from him had knighthood and privilege; although to-day he who"
3245,CANTO XVI.,binds it with a border unites himself with the populace.[23] Already
3246,CANTO XVI.,there were Gualterotti and Importuni; and Borgo[24] would now be more
3247,CANTO XVI.,"quiet, if they had gone hung for new neighbors. The house of which was"
3248,CANTO XVI.,"born your weeping,[25] through its just indignation which has slain"
3249,CANTO XVI.,"you, and put an end to your glad living, was honored, both itself and"
3250,CANTO XVI.,"its consorts. O Buondelmonte, how ill didst thou flee its nuptials"
3251,CANTO XVI.,through the persuasions of another! [26] Many would be glad who now are
3252,CANTO XVI.,"sorrowful, if God had conceded thee to the Ema[27] the first time that"
3253,CANTO XVI.,thou camest to the city. But it behoved that Florence in her last peace
3254,CANTO XVI.,should offer a victim to that broken stone which guards the bridge.[28]

3261,CANTO XVI.,

3263,CANTO XVI.,[3] The Conti Guidi had been compelled to sell to the Florentines their
3264,CANTO XVI.,"stronghold of Montemurlo, because they could not defend it from the"
3265,CANTO XVI.,Pistoians. The Cerchi and the Buondelmonti had been forced by the
3266,CANTO XVI.,Florentine Commune to give up their fortresses and to take up their
3267,CANTO XVI.,"abode in the city, where they became powerful, and where the bitterness"

3704,CANTO XIX.,"describe, no voice ever reported, nor ink wrote, nor was it ever"
3705,CANTO XIX.,"conceived by the fancy; for I saw, and also heard the beak speaking,"

3734,CANTO XIX.,"which was woven of praise of the Divine Grace, become, with songs such"
3735,CANTO XIX.,"as he knows who thereabove rejoices. Then it began, “He who turned the"
3736,CANTO XIX.,"compasses at the verge of the world, and distributed within it so much"
3737,CANTO XIX.,"occult and manifest, could not so imprint His Power on all the universe"
3738,CANTO XIX.,that His Word should not remain in infinite excess.[1] And this makes
3739,CANTO XIX.,"certain that the first proud one, who was the top of every creature,"
3740,CANTO XIX.,"through not awaiting light, fell immature.[2] And hence it appears,"
3741,CANTO XIX.,that every lesser nature is a scant receptacle for that Good which has
3742,CANTO XIX.,"no end and measures Itself by Itself. Wherefore our vision, which needs"
3743,CANTO XIX.,"must be some ray of the Mind with which all things are full, cannot in"
3744,CANTO XIX.,its own nature be so potent that it may not discern its origin to be
3745,CANTO XIX.,far beyond that which is apparent to it.[3] Therefore the sight which
3746,CANTO XIX.,your world receives[4] penetrates into the eternal justice as the eye
3747,CANTO XIX.,"into the sea; which, though from the shore it can see the bottom, on"
3748,CANTO XIX.,"the ocean sees it not, and nevertheless it is there, but the depth"
3749,CANTO XIX.,conceals it. There is no light but that which comes from the serene
3750,CANTO XIX.,"which is never clouded; nay, there is darkness, either shadow of the"
3751,CANTO XIX.,"flesh, or its poison.[5] The hiding place is now open enough to thee,"
3752,CANTO XIX.,which concealed from thee the living Justice concerning which thou
3753,CANTO XIX.,"madest such frequent question;[6] for thou saidest,—'A man is born on"
3754,CANTO XIX.,"the bank of the Indus, and no one is there who may speak of Christ, nor"
3755,CANTO XIX.,"who may read, nor who may write; and all his wishes and acts are good"
3756,CANTO XIX.,"so far as human reason sees, without sin in life or in speech. He dies"
3757,CANTO XIX.,"unbaptized, and without faith: where is this Justice which condemns"
3758,CANTO XIX.,"him? where is his sin if he does not believe?' Now who art thou, that"
3759,CANTO XIX.,wouldst sit upon a bench to judge a thousand miles away with the short
3760,CANTO XIX.,"vision of a single span? Assuredly, for him who subtilizes with me,[7]"

4009,CANTO XX.,"eye more enkindled, the blessed ensign answered me , in order not to"
4010,CANTO XX.,keep me in wondering suspense: “I see that thou believest these things
4011,CANTO XX.,"because I say them, but thou seest not how; so that, although believed"
4012,CANTO XX.,"in, they are hidden. Thou dost as one who fully apprehends a thing by"
4013,CANTO XX.,"name, but cannot see its quiddity unless another explain it. Regnum"
4014,CANTO XX.,"coelorum[4] suffers violence from fervent love, and from a living hope"
4015,CANTO XX.,which vanquishes the divine will; not in such wise as man overcomes
4016,CANTO XX.,"man, but vanquishes it, because it wills to be vanquished, and,"
4017,CANTO XX.,"vanquished, vanquishes with its own benignity. The first life of the"
4018,CANTO XX.,"eyebrow and the fifth make thee marvel, because thou seest the region"
4019,CANTO XX.,of the Angels painted with them. From their bodies they did not issue
4020,CANTO XX.,"Gentiles, as thou believest, but Christians, in firm faith, one in the"
4021,CANTO XX.,"Feet that were to suffer, one in the Feet that had suffered.[5] For the"
4022,CANTO XX.,"one from Hell, where there is never return to righteous will, came back"
4023,CANTO XX.,"to his bones; and that was the reward of living hope; of living hope,"
4024,CANTO XX.,"which put its power in prayers made to God to raise him up, so that it"
4025,CANTO XX.,"might be possible his will should be moved.[6] The glorious soul,"
4026,CANTO XX.,"whereof I speak, returning to the flesh, in which it remained short"
4027,CANTO XX.,"while, believed in Him who was able to aid it; and in believing was"
4028,CANTO XX.,"kindled to such fire of true love, that at the second death it was"
4029,CANTO XX.,"worthy to come to this sport. The other, through grace which distils"
4030,CANTO XX.,from a fount so deep that creature never pushed the eye far as its
4031,CANTO XX.,"primal wave, there below set all his love on righteousness; wherefore"
4032,CANTO XX.,"from grace to grace God opened his eye to our future redemption, so"
4033,CANTO XX.,"that he believed in it, and thenceforth endured no more the stench of"
4034,CANTO XX.,"paganism, and reproved therefor the perverse folk. More than a thousand"
4035,CANTO XX.,"years before baptizing,[7] those three ladies whom thou sawest at the"
4036,CANTO XX.,"right wheel[8] were to him for baptism. O predestination, how remote is"
4037,CANTO XX.,thy root from the sight of those who see not the entire First Cause!
4038,CANTO XX.,"And ye, mortals, keep yourselves restrained in judging; for we who see"
4039,CANTO XX.,"God know not yet all the elect. And unto us such want is sweet, for our"
4040,CANTO XX.,"good is perfected in this good, that what God wills we also will.”"
4041,CANTO XX.,
4042,CANTO XX.,"[1] So, seemed the image (that is, the eagle), satiated with its bliss,"
4043,CANTO XX.,whether in the speech or the silence imposed upon it by the Eternal
4044,CANTO XX.,"Pleasure, in accordance with which all things fulfil their ends."
4045,CANTO XX.,
4046,CANTO XX.,

4075,CANTO XX.,"string accompany a good singer, whereby the song acquires more"
4076,CANTO XX.,"pleasantness, so it comes back to my mind that, while it spake, I saw"

4091,CANTO XXI.,"Now were my eyes fixed again upon the countenance of my Lady, and my"
4092,CANTO XXI.,"mind with them, and from every other intent it was withdrawn; and she"
4093,CANTO XXI.,"was not smiling, but, “If I should smile,” she began to me, “thou"
4094,CANTO XXI.,"wouldst become such as Semele was when she became ashes; for my beauty,"
4095,CANTO XXI.,"which along the stairs of the eternal palace is kindled the more, as"
4096,CANTO XXI.,"thou hast seen, the higher it ascends, is so resplendent that, if it"

4102,CANTO XXI.,
4103,CANTO XXI.,"[1] The seventh splendor is Saturn, which was in the sign of the Lion,"
4104,CANTO XXI.,"whence its rays fell to earth, mingled with the strong influences of"
4105,CANTO XXI.,the sign.

4107,CANTO XXI.,
4108,CANTO XXI.,He who should know what was the pasture of my sight in her blessed

4111,CANTO XXI.,obey my celestial escort.
4112,CANTO XXI.,
4113,CANTO XXI.,"Within the crystal which, circling round the world, bears the name of"
4114,CANTO XXI.,"its shining leader, under whom all wickedness lay dead,[1] I saw, of"
4115,CANTO XXI.,"the color of gold through which a sunbeam is shining,[2] a stairway"
4116,CANTO XXI.,"rising up so high that my eye followed it not. I saw, moreover, so many"
4117,CANTO XXI.,"splendors descending, along the steps, that I thought every light which"
4118,CANTO XXI.,appears in heaven was there diffused.

4121,CANTO XXI.,

4123,CANTO XXI.,[2] As in a painted window.

4126,CANTO XXI.,"And as, according to their natural custom, the rooks, at the beginning"

4128,CANTO XXI.,"then some go away without return, others wheel round to whence they had"
4129,CANTO XXI.,"set forth, and others, circling, make a stay; such fashion it seemed to"
4130,CANTO XXI.,"me was here in that sparkling which came together, so soon as it struck"
4131,CANTO XXI.,on a certain step; and that which stopped nearest to us became so
4132,CANTO XXI.,"bright that I said in my thought, “I clearly see the love which thou"
4133,CANTO XXI.,"signifiest to me. But she, from whom I await the how and the when of"
4134,CANTO XXI.,"speech and of silence, stays still; wherefore I, contrary to desire, do"
4135,CANTO XXI.,"well that I ask not.” Whereupon she, who saw my silence, in the sight"
4136,CANTO XXI.,"of Him who sees everything, said to me, “Let loose thy warm desire.”"
4137,CANTO XXI.,
4138,CANTO XXI.,"And I began, “My own merit makes me not worthy of thy answer; but for"
4139,CANTO XXI.,"her sake who concedes to me the asking, O blessed life, that keepest"
4140,CANTO XXI.,"thyself hidden within thine own joy, make known to me the cause which"
4141,CANTO XXI.,has placed thee so near me; and tell why in this wheel the sweet
4142,CANTO XXI.,"symphony of Paradise is silent, which below through the others so"
4143,CANTO XXI.,"devoutly sounds.” “Thou hast thy hearing mortal, as thy sight,” it"
4144,CANTO XXI.,replied to me; “therefore no song is here for the same reason that
4145,CANTO XXI.,Beatrice has no smile. Down along the steps of the holy stairway I have
4146,CANTO XXI.,"thus far descended, only to give thee glad welcome with my speech and"
4147,CANTO XXI.,with the light that mantles me; nor has more love made me to be more
4148,CANTO XXI.,"ready, for as much and more love is burning here above, even as the"
4149,CANTO XXI.,"flaming manifests to thee; but the high charity, which makes us ready"
4150,CANTO XXI.,"servants to the counsel that governs the world, allots here,[1] even as"
4151,CANTO XXI.,"thou observest.” “I see well,” said I, “O sacred lamp, how the free"
4152,CANTO XXI.,will of love suffices in this Court for following the eternal
4153,CANTO XXI.,"Providence. But this is what seems to me hard to discern, why thou"
4154,CANTO XXI.,alone wert predestined to this office among thy consorts.” I had not
4155,CANTO XXI.,"come to the last word before the light made a centre of its middle,"
4156,CANTO XXI.,whirling like a swift milestone. Then the love that was within it
4157,CANTO XXI.,"answered, “A divine light strikes upon me, penetrating through this"
4158,CANTO XXI.,"wherein I embosom me: the virtue of which, conjoined with my vision,"
4159,CANTO XXI.,lifts me above myself so far that I see the Supreme Essence from which
4160,CANTO XXI.,"it emanates. Thence comes the joy wherewith I flame, because to my"
4161,CANTO XXI.,"vision, in proportion as it is clear, I match the clearness of my"
4162,CANTO XXI.,"flame. But that soul in Heaven which is most enlightened,[2] that"
4163,CANTO XXI.,"Seraph who has his eye most fixed on God, could not satisfy thy demand;"
4164,CANTO XXI.,because that which thou askest lies so deep within the abyss of the
4165,CANTO XXI.,"eternal statute, that from every created sight it is cut off. And when"
4166,CANTO XXI.,"thou retumest to the mortal world, carry this back, so that it may no"
4167,CANTO XXI.,more presume to move its feet toward such a goal. The mind which shines
4168,CANTO XXI.,"here, on earth is smoky; wherefore consider how there below it can do"
4169,CANTO XXI.,that which it cannot do though Heaven assume it.”
4170,CANTO XXI.,
4171,CANTO XXI.,[1] Assigns its part to each spirit.
4172,CANTO XXI.,

4174,CANTO XXI.,[2] With the Divine light.
4175,CANTO XXI.,
4176,CANTO XXI.,
4177,CANTO XXI.,"So did its words prescribe to me, that I left the question, and drew me"
4178,CANTO XXI.,"back to ask it humbly who it was. “Between the two shores of Italy, and"
4179,CANTO XXI.,"not very distant from thy native land, rise rocks so lofty that the"
4180,CANTO XXI.,"thunders sound far lower down, and they make a height which is called"
4181,CANTO XXI.,"Catria, beneath which a hermitage is consecrated which is wont to be"
4182,CANTO XXI.,devoted to worship only.”[1] Thus it began again to me with its third
4183,CANTO XXI.,"speech, and then, continuing, it said, “Here in the service of God I"
4184,CANTO XXI.,"became so steadfast, that, with food of olive juice alone, lightly I"
4185,CANTO XXI.,"used to pass the heats and frosts, content in contemplative thoughts."
4186,CANTO XXI.,That cloister was wont to render in abundance to these heavens; and now
4187,CANTO XXI.,it is become so empty as needs must soon be revealed. In that place I
4188,CANTO XXI.,"was Peter Damian,[2] and Peter a sinner had I been in the house of Our"
4189,CANTO XXI.,Lady on the Adriatic shore.[3] Little of mortal life was remaining for
4190,CANTO XXI.,"me, when I was sought for and dragged to that hat[4] which ever is"
4191,CANTO XXI.,"passed down from bad to worse. Cephas[5] came, and the great vessel of"
4192,CANTO XXI.,"the Holy Spirit[6] came, lean and barefoot, taking the food of"
4193,CANTO XXI.,whatsoever inn. Now the modern pastors require one to hold them up on
4194,CANTO XXI.,"this side and that, and one to lead them, so heavy are they, and one to"
4195,CANTO XXI.,"support them behind. They cover their palfreys with their mantles, so"
4196,CANTO XXI.,"that two beasts go under one skin. O Patience, that endurest so much!”"
4197,CANTO XXI.,At this voice I saw more flamelets from step to step descending and
4198,CANTO XXI.,"revolving, and each revolution made them more beautiful. Round about"
4199,CANTO XXI.,"this one they came, and stopped, and uttered a cry of such deep sound"
4200,CANTO XXI.,"that here could be none like it, nor did I understand it, the thunder"
4201,CANTO XXI.,so overcame me.
4202,CANTO XXI.,
4203,CANTO XXI.,[1] Catria is a high offshoot to the east from the chain of the
4204,CANTO XXI.,"Apennines, between Urbino and Gubbio. Far up on its side lies the"

4242,CANTO XXII.,"which is wont to reassure him, said to me, 11 Knowest thou not, that"

4244,CANTO XXII.,whatever is done here comes from good zeal? How the song would have
4245,CANTO XXII.,"transformed thee, and I by smiling, thou canst now conceive, since the"

4247,CANTO XXII.,"prayers, already would be known to thee the vengeance which thou shalt"

4256,CANTO XXII.,"and attempts not to ask, he so fears the too-much. And the largest and"
4257,CANTO XXII.,the most luculent of those pearls came forward to make of its own
4258,CANTO XXII.,"accord my wish content. Then within it I heard, “If thou couldst see,"
4259,CANTO XXII.,"as I do, the charity which burns among us, thy thoughts would be"
4260,CANTO XXII.,"expressed. But that thou through waiting mayst not delay thy high end,"

4272,CANTO XXII.,"fixed their feet, and held a steadfast heart.” And I to him, “The"
4273,CANTO XXII.,"affection which thou displayest in speaking with me, and the good"
4274,CANTO XXII.,"semblance which I see and note in all your ardors, have so expanded my"
4275,CANTO XXII.,"confidence as the sun does the rose, when she becomes open so much as"

4277,CANTO XXII.,"me if I have power to receive so much grace, that I may see thee with"
4278,CANTO XXII.,"uncovered shape.” Whereon he, “Brother, thy high desire shall be"
4279,CANTO XXII.,"fulfilled in the last sphere, where are fulfilled all others and my"
4280,CANTO XXII.,"own. There perfect, mature, and whole is every desire; in that alone is"
4281,CANTO XXII.,"every part there where it always was: for it is not in space, and hath"
4282,CANTO XXII.,"not poles; and our stairway reaches up to it, wherefore thus from thy"
4283,CANTO XXII.,sight it conceals itself. Far up as there the patriarch Jacob saw it
4284,CANTO XXII.,stretch its topmost part when it appeared to him so laden with Angels.
4285,CANTO XXII.,But now no one lifts his feet from earth to ascend it; and my Rule is

4292,CANTO XXII.,soft that a good beginning suffices not below from the springing of the

4347,CANTO XXII.,comes glad through this round aether.” With my sight I returned through
4348,CANTO XXII.,"each and all the seven spheres, and saw this globe such that I smiled"
4349,CANTO XXII.,at its mean semblance; and that counsel I approve as best which holds
4350,CANTO XXII.,it of least account; and he who thinks of other things may be called
4351,CANTO XXII.,truly worthy. I saw the daughter of Latona enkindled without that
4352,CANTO XXII.,shadow which had been the cause why I once believed her rare and dense.
4353,CANTO XXII.,"The aspect of thy son, Hyperion, here I endured, and I saw how Maia and"
4354,CANTO XXII.,Dione[1] move around and near him. Then appeared to me the
4355,CANTO XXII.,"temperateness of Jove, between his father and his son,[2] and then was"
4356,CANTO XXII.,clear to me the variation which they make in their places. And all the
4357,CANTO XXII.,"seven were displayed to me,[[how great they are and how swift they are,"
4358,CANTO XXII.,and how they are in distant houses. While I was revolving with the
4359,CANTO XXII.,"eternal Twins, the little threshing-floor[3] which makes us so fierce"
4360,CANTO XXII.,"all appeared to me, from its hills to its harbors."
4361,CANTO XXII.,
4362,CANTO XXII.,"[1] The mothers of Venus and Mercury, by whose names these planets are"

4381,CANTO XXIII.,
4382,CANTO XXIII.,

4384,CANTO XXIII.,"sweet brood through the night which hides things from us, who, in order"
4385,CANTO XXIII.,to see their longed-for looks and to find the food wherewith she may
4386,CANTO XXIII.,"feed them, in which heavy toils are pleasing to her, anticipates the"
4387,CANTO XXIII.,"time upon the open twig, and with ardent affection awaits the sun,"
4388,CANTO XXIII.,fixedly looking till the dawn may break; thus my Lady was standing
4389,CANTO XXIII.,"erect and attentive, turned toward the region beneath which the sun"
4390,CANTO XXIII.,"shows least haste;[1] so that I, seeing her rapt and eager, became such"
4391,CANTO XXIII.,"as he who in desire should wish for something, and in hope is"
4392,CANTO XXIII.,satisfied. But short while was there between one and the other WHEN:
4393,CANTO XXIII.,"that of my awaiting, I mean, and of my seeing the heavens become"
4394,CANTO XXIII.,"brighter and brighter. And Beatrice said, “Behold the hosts of the"
4395,CANTO XXIII.,"triumph of Christ, and all the fruit harvested by the revolution of"
4396,CANTO XXIII.,"these spheres.”[2] It seemed to me her face was all aflame, and her"

4398,CANTO XXIII.,description.

4425,CANTO XXIII.,"She said to me, “That which overcomes thee is a power from which naught"
4426,CANTO XXIII.,defends itself. Here is the Wisdom and the Power that opened the roads
4427,CANTO XXIII.,"between heaven and earth, for which there had already been such long"
4428,CANTO XXIII.,desire.”
4429,CANTO XXIII.,
4430,CANTO XXIII.,"As fire from a cloud unlocks itself by dilating, so that it is not"
4431,CANTO XXIII.,"contained therein, and against its own nature falls down to earth, so"
4432,CANTO XXIII.,"my mind, becoming greater amid those feasts, issued from itself; and"
4433,CANTO XXIII.,what it became cannot remember.
4434,CANTO XXIII.,
4435,CANTO XXIII.,“Open thine eyes and look at what I am; thou hast seen things such that
4436,CANTO XXIII.,thou art become able to sustain my smile.” I was as one who awakes from
4437,CANTO XXIII.,a forgotten dream and endeavors in vain to bring it back again to
4438,CANTO XXIII.,"memory, when I heard this invitation, worthy of such gratitude that it"
4439,CANTO XXIII.,is never effaced from the book which records the past. If now all those
4440,CANTO XXIII.,tongues which Polyhymnia and her sisters made most fat with their
4441,CANTO XXIII.,"sweetest milk should sound to aid me, one would not come to a"
4442,CANTO XXIII.,thousandth of the truth in singing the holy smile and how it made the
4443,CANTO XXIII.,holy face resplendent. And thus in depicting Paradise the consecrated
4444,CANTO XXIII.,"poem needs must make a leap, even as one who finds his way cut off. But"
4445,CANTO XXIII.,whoso should consider the ponderous theme and the mortal shoulder which
4446,CANTO XXIII.,therewith is laden would not blame it if under this it tremble. It is
4447,CANTO XXIII.,"no coasting voyage for a little barque, this which the intrepid prow"
4448,CANTO XXIII.,"goes cleaving, nor for a pilot who would spare himself."
4449,CANTO XXIII.,
4450,CANTO XXIII.,“Why doth my face so enamour thee that thou turnest not to the fair
4451,CANTO XXIII.,garden which beneath the rays of Christ is blossoming? Here is the
4452,CANTO XXIII.,"rose,[1] in which the Divine Word became flesh: here are the lilies[2]"
4453,CANTO XXIII.,"by whose odor the good way was taken.” Thus Beatrice, and I, who to her"
4454,CANTO XXIII.,"counsel was wholly prompt, again betook me unto the battle of the"
4455,CANTO XXIII.,feeble brows.
4456,CANTO XXIII.,
4457,CANTO XXIII.,[1] The Virgin.
4458,CANTO XXIII.,

4462,CANTO XXIII.,"to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge"
4463,CANTO XXIII.,"by us in every place.” In the Vulgate the words are, “odorem notitiae"
4464,CANTO XXIII.,suae manifestat per nos.”
4465,CANTO XXIII.,
4466,CANTO XXIII.,
4467,CANTO XXIII.,"As my eyes, covered with a shadow, have ere now seen a meadow of"
4468,CANTO XXIII.,"flowers in a sunbeam which streamed bright through a rifted cloud, so"
4469,CANTO XXIII.,saw I many throngs of splendors flashed-upon from above with burning
4470,CANTO XXIII.,"rays, without seeing the source of the gleams. O benignant Power which"
4471,CANTO XXIII.,"so dost impress them, upwards didst thou exalt thyself to bestow space"
4472,CANTO XXIII.,"there for my eyes, which were powerless.[1]"
4473,CANTO XXIII.,
4474,CANTO XXIII.,"[1] The eyes of Dante, powerless to endure the sight of the glorified"
4475,CANTO XXIII.,"body of Christ, when that is withdrawn on high, are able to look upon"
4476,CANTO XXIII.,those whom the light of Christ illumines.
4477,CANTO XXIII.,
4478,CANTO XXIII.,
4479,CANTO XXIII.,The name of the fair flower which I ever invoke both morning and
4480,CANTO XXIII.,"evening, wholly constrained my mind to gaze upon the greater fire.[1]"
4481,CANTO XXIII.,"And when the form and the glory of the living star, which up. there"
4482,CANTO XXIII.,"surpasses as here below it surpassed, were depicted in both my eyes,"
4483,CANTO XXIII.,"through the mid heavens a torch, formed in a circle in fashion of a"
4484,CANTO XXIII.,"crown, descended, and engirt it, and revolved around it. Whatever"
4485,CANTO XXIII.,"melody sounds sweetest here below, and to itself most draws the soul,"
4486,CANTO XXIII.,"would seem a cloud which, rent apart, thunders, compared with the sound"
4487,CANTO XXIII.,of that lyre wherewith was crowned the beauteous sapphire by which the
4488,CANTO XXIII.,"brightest Heaven is ensapphired. “I am angelic Love, and I circle round"
4489,CANTO XXIII.,the lofty joy which breathes from the bosom which was the hostelry of
4490,CANTO XXIII.,"our desire; and I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while thou shalt follow"
4491,CANTO XXIII.,thy Son and make the supreme sphere more divine because thou enterest
4492,CANTO XXIII.,"it.” Thus the circling melody sealed itself up, and all the other"
4493,CANTO XXIII.,lights made resound the name of Mary.
4494,CANTO XXIII.,
4495,CANTO XXIII.,"[1] The Virgin,—Rosa mistica,—the brightest of all the host that"
4496,CANTO XXIII.,remained.

4499,CANTO XXIII.,"The royal mantle[1] of all the volumes[2] of the world, which is most"

4501,CANTO XXIII.,"inner shore so distant above us that sight of it, there where I was,"
4502,CANTO XXIII.,did not yet appear to me. Therefore my eyes had not the power to follow
4503,CANTO XXIII.,"the incoronate flame, which mounted upward following her own seed. And"
4504,CANTO XXIII.,"as a little child which, when it has taken the milk, stretches its arms"
4505,CANTO XXIII.,"toward its mother, through the spirit that flames up outwardly, each of"
4506,CANTO XXIII.,"these white splendors stretched upward with its summit, so that the"
4507,CANTO XXIII.,deep aflection which they had for Mary was manifest to me. Then they
4508,CANTO XXIII.,"remained there in ray sight, singing “Regina coeli “ so sweetly that"
4509,CANTO XXIII.,never has the delight departed from me. Oh how great is the plenty that
4510,CANTO XXIII.,is heaped up in those most rich chests which were good laborers in
4511,CANTO XXIII.,sowing here below! Here they live and enjoy the treasure that was
4512,CANTO XXIII.,"acquired while weeping in the exile of Babylon, where the gold was left"
4513,CANTO XXIII.,"aside.[3] Here triumphs, under the high Son of God and of Mary, in his"
4514,CANTO XXIII.,"victory, both with the ancient and with the new council, he who holds"
4515,CANTO XXIII.,the keys of such glory.[4]

4549,CANTO XXIV.,
4550,CANTO XXIV.,[1] A carol was a dance with song; here used for the souls who composed

4557,CANTO XXIV.,revolved round Beatrice with a song so divine that my fancy repeats it
4558,CANTO XXIV.,"not to me; therefore the pen makes a leap, and I write it not, for our"
4559,CANTO XXIV.,"imagination, much more our speech, is of too vivid color[1] for such"
4560,CANTO XXIV.,"folds. “O holy sister mine, who so devoutly prayest to us, by thy"

4562,CANTO XXIV.,"it had stopped, the blessed fire directed to my Lady its breath, which"
4563,CANTO XXIV.,"spoke thus as I have said. And she, “O light eternal of the great man"
4564,CANTO XXIV.,"to whom our Lord left the keys, which he bore below, of this marvellous"
4565,CANTO XXIV.,"joy, test this man on points light and grave, as pleases thee,"
4566,CANTO XXIV.,"concerning the Faith, through which thou didst walk upon the sea. If he"
4567,CANTO XXIV.,"loves rightly, and hopes rightly, and believes, it is hidden not from"

4569,CANTO XXIV.,"But since this realm has made citizens by the true faith, it is well"
4570,CANTO XXIV.,that to glorify it speech of it should fall to him.”[2]
4571,CANTO XXIV.,
4572,CANTO XXIV.,"[1] The figure is a little obscure; pieghe, “folds,” is a rhyme-word;"
4573,CANTO XXIV.,the meaning seems to be that as folds cannot be painted properly with
4574,CANTO XXIV.,"bright hues, so our imagination and our speech are not delicate enough"
4575,CANTO XXIV.,for conceiving and depicting such exquisite delights.
4576,CANTO XXIV.,
4577,CANTO XXIV.,
4578,CANTO XXIV.,"[2] The meaning seems to be,—Thou knowest that he has true faith, but"
4579,CANTO XXIV.,"because by its means one becomes a citizen of this realm, it is well"
4580,CANTO XXIV.,that he should celebrate it.
4581,CANTO XXIV.,

4585,CANTO XXIV.,"so, while she was speaking, I was arming me with every reason, in order"
4586,CANTO XXIV.,"to be ready for such a questioner, and for such a profession."
4587,CANTO XXIV.,
4588,CANTO XXIV.,"“Say thou, good Christian, declare thyself; Faith,—what is it?” Whereon"
4589,CANTO XXIV.,I raised my brow to that light whence this was breathed out. Then I
4590,CANTO XXIV.,"turned to Beatrice, and she made prompt signals to me that I should"
4591,CANTO XXIV.,"pour the water forth from my internal fount. “May the Grace,” began I,"
4592,CANTO XXIV.,"“which grants to me that I confess myself to the high captain, cause my"
4593,CANTO XXIV.,"conceptions to be expressed.”[1] And I went on, “As the veracious pen,"
4594,CANTO XXIV.,"Father, of thy dear brother (who with thee set Rome on the good track)"
4595,CANTO XXIV.,"wrote of it, Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and evidence"
4596,CANTO XXIV.,of things not seen:[2] and this appears to me its essence.” Then I
4597,CANTO XXIV.,"heard, “Rightly dost thou think, if thou understandest well why he"
4598,CANTO XXIV.,"placed it among the substances, and then among the evidences.” And I"
4599,CANTO XXIV.,thereon: “The deep things which grant unto me here the sight of
4600,CANTO XXIV.,"themselves, are so hidden to eyes below that there their existence is"
4601,CANTO XXIV.,"in belief alone, upon which the high hope is founded, and therefore it"
4602,CANTO XXIV.,takes the designation of substance; and from this belief we needs must
4603,CANTO XXIV.,"syllogize, without having other sight, wherefore it receives the"
4604,CANTO XXIV.,"designation of evidence.”[3] Then I heard, “If whatever is acquired"
4605,CANTO XXIV.,"below for doctrine, were so understood, the wit of sophist would have"
4606,CANTO XXIV.,no place there.” Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love; then
4607,CANTO XXIV.,"it added, “Very well have the alloy and the weight of this coin been"
4608,CANTO XXIV.,"now run through, but tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?” And I,"
4609,CANTO XXIV.,"“Yes, I have it so shining and so round that in its stamp nothing is"
4610,CANTO XXIV.,uncertain to me.” Then issued from the deep light which was shining
4611,CANTO XXIV.,"there, “This precious jewel, whereon every virtue is founded, whence"
4612,CANTO XXIV.,"came it to thee?” And I, “The abundant rain of the Heavenly Spirit,"
4613,CANTO XXIV.,"which is diffused over the Old and over the New parchments, is a"
4614,CANTO XXIV.,syllogism[4] which has proved it to me so acutely that in comparison
4615,CANTO XXIV.,"with it every demonstration seems to me obtuse.” I heard then, “The Old"
4616,CANTO XXIV.,"and the New proposition[5] which are so conclusive to thee,—why dost"
4617,CANTO XXIV.,"thou hold them for divine speech?” And I, “The proofs which disclose"
4618,CANTO XXIV.,"the truth to me are the works[6] that followed, for which nature never"
4619,CANTO XXIV.,"heated iron, nor beat anvil.” It was replied to me, “Say, what assures"
4620,CANTO XXIV.,thee that these works were? The very thing itself which requires to be
4621,CANTO XXIV.,"proved, naught else, affirms it to thee.” “If the world were converted"
4622,CANTO XXIV.,"to Christianity,” said I, “without miracles, this alone is such that"
4623,CANTO XXIV.,the others are not the hundredth part; for thou didst enter poor and
4624,CANTO XXIV.,"fasting into the field to sow the good plant, which once was a vine and"
4625,CANTO XXIV.,now has become a thornbush.”

4631,CANTO XXIV.,
4632,CANTO XXIV.,
4633,CANTO XXIV.,[3] The argument is as follows: The things of the spiritual world
4634,CANTO XXIV.,"having no visible existence upon earth, the hope of blessedness rests"
4635,CANTO XXIV.,"only on belief unsupported by material proof; this belief is Faith, and"
4636,CANTO XXIV.,"since on it alone are the high hopes founded, it is properly called"
4637,CANTO XXIV.,"their substance, that is, their essential quality. And since all our"
4638,CANTO XXIV.,reasoning concerning spiritual things must be drawn not from visible
4639,CANTO XXIV.,"things, but from the convictions of Faith, our faith is also properly"
4640,CANTO XXIV.,called evidence.
4641,CANTO XXIV.,
4642,CANTO XXIV.,
4643,CANTO XXIV.,[4] The evidence afforded by the Old and the New Testament that they

4663,CANTO XXIV.,"that which thou so believedst that thou, toward the sepulchre, didst"
4664,CANTO XXIV.,"outdo younger feet,”[1] began I, “thou wishest that I should declare"
4665,CANTO XXIV.,"here the form of my ready belief, and also thou inquirest the cause of"
4666,CANTO XXIV.,"it. And I answer: I believe in one God, sole and eternal, who, unmoved,"
4667,CANTO XXIV.,moves all the Heavens with love and with desire; and for such belief
4668,CANTO XXIV.,"have I not only proofs physical and metaphysical, but that truth also"
4669,CANTO XXIV.,"gives it to me which hence rains down through Moses, through Prophets,"
4670,CANTO XXIV.,"and through Psalms, through the Gospel, and through you who wrote after"

4672,CANTO XXIV.,"and these I believe one essence, so one and so threefold that it will"

4701,CANTO XXV.,"voice, with other fleece, Poet will I return, and on the font of my"
4702,CANTO XXV.,baptism will I take the crown; because there I entered into the faith
4703,CANTO XXV.,"which makes the souls known to God, and afterward. Peter, for its sake,"
4704,CANTO XXV.,thus encircled my brow.
4705,CANTO XXV.,
4706,CANTO XXV.,Then a light moved toward us from that sphere whence the first-fruit
4707,CANTO XXV.,"which Christ left of His vicars had issued. And my Lady, full of"
4708,CANTO XXV.,"gladness, said to me, “Look, look! behold the Baron for whose sake"
4709,CANTO XXV.,Galicia is visited there below.”[1]
4710,CANTO XXV.,
4711,CANTO XXV.,"[1] It was believed that St. James, the brother of St. John, was buried"
4712,CANTO XXV.,"at Compostella, in the Spanish province of Galicia. His shrine was one"
4713,CANTO XXV.,of the chief objects of pilgrimage during the Middle Ages.
4714,CANTO XXV.,
4715,CANTO XXV.,
4716,CANTO XXV.,"Even as when the dove alights near his companion, and one, turning and"
4717,CANTO XXV.,"cooing, displays its affection to the other, so by the one great Prince"
4718,CANTO XXV.,"glorious I saw the other greeted, praising the food which feasts them"
4719,CANTO XXV.,"thereabove. But after their gratulation was completed, silent coram"
4720,CANTO XXV.,"me,[1] each stopped, so ignited that it overcame my sight. Smiling,"
4721,CANTO XXV.,"then Beatrice said, “Illustrious life, by whom the largess of our"
4722,CANTO XXV.,"basilica has been written,[2] do thou make Hope resound upon this"
4723,CANTO XXV.,height; thou knowest that thou dost represent it as many times as Jesus
4724,CANTO XXV.,to the three displayed most brightness.”[3] “Lift up thy head and make
4725,CANTO XXV.,thyself assured; for that which comes up here from the mortal world
4726,CANTO XXV.,needs must be ripened in our rays.” This comfort from the second fire
4727,CANTO XXV.,came to me; whereon I lifted up my eyes unto the mountains which bent
4728,CANTO XXV.,them down before with too great weight.
4729,CANTO XXV.,
4730,CANTO XXV.,"[1] “Before me.” Here, as sometimes elsewhere, it is not evident why"
4731,CANTO XXV.,Dante uses Latin words.
4732,CANTO XXV.,
4733,CANTO XXV.,
4734,CANTO XXV.,"[2] The reference is to the Epistle of James, which Dante, falling into"
4735,CANTO XXV.,"a common error, attributes to St. James the Greater. The special words"
4736,CANTO XXV.,"be had in mind may have been: “ God, that giveth to all men liberally,”"
4737,CANTO XXV.,"i. 5; and “ Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and"
4738,CANTO XXV.,"cometh down from the Father of lights,” i. 17. By “basilica” is meant"
4739,CANTO XXV.,the court or church of heaven.
4740,CANTO XXV.,
4741,CANTO XXV.,
4742,CANTO XXV.,"[3] Peter, James, and John, were chosen by their Master to be present"
4743,CANTO XXV.,"at the raising of the daughter of Jairus, and to witness his"
4744,CANTO XXV.,"Transfiguration. Peter personifying Faith, John personifying Love, it"
4745,CANTO XXV.,was natural to take James as the personification of Hope.
4746,CANTO XXV.,
4747,CANTO XXV.,
4748,CANTO XXV.,"“Since, through grace, our Emperor wills that thou, before thy death,"
4749,CANTO XXV.,"come face to face with his Counts in the most secret hall, so that,"
4750,CANTO XXV.,"having seen the truth of this Court, thou mayest therewith confirm in"
4751,CANTO XXV.,"thyself and others the Hope which there below rightly enamours, say"
4752,CANTO XXV.,"what it is, and how thy mind is flowering with it, and say whence it"
4753,CANTO XXV.,came to thee;” thus further did the second light proceed. And that
4754,CANTO XXV.,"compassionate one, who guided the feathers of my wings to such high"
4755,CANTO XXV.,"flight, thus in the reply anticipated me.[1] “The Church militant has"
4756,CANTO XXV.,"not any son with more hope, as is written in the Sun which irradiates"
4757,CANTO XXV.,"all our band; therefore it is conceded to him, that from Egypt be"
4758,CANTO XXV.,"should come to Jerusalem to see, ere the warfare be at end for him. The"
4759,CANTO XXV.,"other two points which are asked not for sake of knowing, but that he"
4760,CANTO XXV.,"may report how greatly this virtue is pleasing to thee, to him I leave,"
4761,CANTO XXV.,"for they will not be difficult to him, nor of vainglory, and let him"
4762,CANTO XXV.,"answer to this, and may the grace of God accord this to him.”"
4763,CANTO XXV.,
4764,CANTO XXV.,"[1] Beatrice answers the question to which the reply, had it been left"
4765,CANTO XXV.,"to Dante, might seem to involve self-praise."
4766,CANTO XXV.,
4767,CANTO XXV.,
4768,CANTO XXV.,"As a disciple who follows his teacher, prompt and willing, in that"
4769,CANTO XXV.,"wherein he is expert, so that his worth may be disclosed: “Hope,” said"
4770,CANTO XXV.,"I, “is a sure expectation of future glory, which divine grace produces,"
4771,CANTO XXV.,"and preceding merit.[1] From many stars this light comes to me, but be"
4772,CANTO XXV.,instilled it first into my heart who was the supreme singer[2] of the
4773,CANTO XXV.,"supreme Leader. Sperent in te,[3] 'who know thy name,' he says in his"
4774,CANTO XXV.,"Theody,[4] and who knows it not, if he has my faith? Thou afterwards"
4775,CANTO XXV.,"didst instil it into me with his instillation in thy Epistle, so that I"
4776,CANTO XXV.,"am full, and upon others shower down again your rain.”"
4777,CANTO XXV.,
4778,CANTO XXV.,[1] These words are taken directly from Peter Lombard (Liber

4794,CANTO XXV.,"followed me far as the palm, and to the issue of the field, wills that"
4795,CANTO XXV.,"breathe anew to thee, that thou delight in it; and it is my pleasure,"

4880,CANTO XXVI.,"consumed on me, it is well that thou make up for it by discourse. Begin"
4881,CANTO XXVI.,"then, and tell whereto thy soul is aimed, and make thy reckoning that"

4883,CANTO XXVI.,thee through this divine region has in her look the virtue which the
4884,CANTO XXVI.,"band of Ananias had.”[1] I said, “According to her pleasure, or soon or"

4886,CANTO XXVI.,with the fire wherewith I ever burn! The Good which makes this court
4887,CANTO XXVI.,"content is Alpha and Omega of whatsoever writing Love reads to me,"
4888,CANTO XXVI.,either low or loud.” That same voice which had taken from me fear of
4889,CANTO XXVI.,"the sudden dazzling, laid on me the charge to speak further, and said,"
4890,CANTO XXVI.,“Surely with a finer sieve it behoves thee to clarify; it behoves thee
4891,CANTO XXVI.,"to tell who directed thy bow to such a target.” And I, “By philosophic"
4892,CANTO XXVI.,"arguments and by authority that hence descends, such love must needs be"
4893,CANTO XXVI.,"impressed on me; for the good, so far as it is good, in proportion as"
4894,CANTO XXVI.,"it is understood, kindles love; and so much the greater as the more of"
4895,CANTO XXVI.,"goodness it includes within itself. Therefore, to the Essence (wherein"
4896,CANTO XXVI.,is such supremacy that every good which is found outside of It is
4897,CANTO XXVI.,"naught else than a beam of Its own radiance), more than to any other,"
4898,CANTO XXVI.,the mind of every one who discerns the truth on which this argument is
4899,CANTO XXVI.,founded must needs be moved in love.[2] Such truth to my intelligence

4901,CANTO XXVI.,sempiternal substances.[3] The voice of the true Author makes it plain
4902,CANTO XXVI.,"who, speaking of Himself, says to Moses, 'I will make thee see all"
4903,CANTO XXVI.,"goodness.'[4] Thou, too, makest it plain to me, beginning the lofty"
4904,CANTO XXVI.,"proclamation which there below, above all other trump, declares the"
4905,CANTO XXVI.,"secret of this place on high.”[5] And I heard, “By human understanding,"
4906,CANTO XXVI.,"and by authorities concordant with it, thy sovran love looks unto God;"

4972,CANTO XXVI.,"evident to me, through its covering, how gladly it came to do me"

4974,CANTO XXVI.,"better discern thy wish, than thou whatever thing is most certain to"
4975,CANTO XXVI.,thee; because I see it in the truthful mirror which makes of Itself a
4976,CANTO XXVI.,"likeness of other tbings, while nothing makes for It a likeness of"
4977,CANTO XXVI.,Itself.[1] Thou wouldst hear how long it is since God placed me in the
4978,CANTO XXVI.,lofty garden where this Lady disposed thee for so long a stairway; and
4979,CANTO XXVI.,how long it was a delight to my eyes; and the proper cause of the great
4980,CANTO XXVI.,"wrath; and the idiom which I used and which I made. Now, my son, the"
4981,CANTO XXVI.,"tasting of the tree was not by itself the cause of so long an exile,"
4982,CANTO XXVI.,but only the overpassing of the bound. There whence thy Lady moved

4986,CANTO XXVI.,tongue which I spoke was all extinct long before the people of Nimrod
4987,CANTO XXVI.,attempted their unaccomplishable work; for never was any product of the

5047,CANTO XXVII.,"came such as Jove would become, if be and Mars were birds, and should"
5048,CANTO XXVII.,interchange feathers.[1] The Providence which here apportions turn and
5049,CANTO XXVII.,"office, had imposed silence on the blessed choir on every side, when I"
5050,CANTO XXVII.,"heard, “If I change color, marvel not; for, while I speak, thou shalt"
5051,CANTO XXVII.,"see all these change color. He who on earth usurps my place, my place,"
5052,CANTO XXVII.,"my place, which is vacant in the presence of the Son of God, has made"
5053,CANTO XXVII.,"of my burial-place a sewer of blood and of stench, wherewith the"
5054,CANTO XXVII.,"Perverse One who fell from here above, below there is placated.”"

5059,CANTO XXVII.,"With that color which, by reason of the opposite sun, paints the cloud"

5061,CANTO XXVII.,"like a modest lady who abides sure of herself, and at the fault of"
5062,CANTO XXVII.,"another, in bearing of it only, becomes timid, even thus did Beatrice"
5063,CANTO XXVII.,change countenance; and such eclipse I believe there was in heaven when
5064,CANTO XXVII.,the Supreme Power suffered.
5065,CANTO XXVII.,
5066,CANTO XXVII.,"Then his words proceeded, in a voice so transmuted from itself that his"
5067,CANTO XXVII.,countenance was not more changed; “The Bride of Christ was not nurtured
5068,CANTO XXVII.,"on my blood, on that of Linus and of Cletus, to be employed for acquist"
5069,CANTO XXVII.,of gold; but for acquist of this glad life Sixtus and Pius and Calixtus
5070,CANTO XXVII.,and Urban[1] shed their blood after much weeping. It was not our
5071,CANTO XXVII.,intention that part of the Christian people should sit on the right
5072,CANTO XXVII.,"hand of our successors, and part on the other; nor that the keys which"
5073,CANTO XXVII.,were conceded to me should become a sign upon a banner which should
5074,CANTO XXVII.,fight against those who are baptized;[2] nor that I should be a figure
5075,CANTO XXVII.,"on a seal to venal and mendacious privileges, whereat I often redden"
5076,CANTO XXVII.,"and flash. In garb of shepherd, rapacious wolves are seen from"
5077,CANTO XXVII.,"here-above over all the pastures: O defence of God, why dost thou yet"
5078,CANTO XXVII.,lie still! To drink our blood Cahorsines and Gascons are making
5079,CANTO XXVII.,"ready:[3] O good beginning, to what vile end behoves it that thou fall!"
5080,CANTO XXVII.,But the high Providence which with Scipio defended for Rome the glory
5081,CANTO XXVII.,"of the world, will succor speedily, as I conceive. And thou, son, who"
5082,CANTO XXVII.,"because of thy mortal weight wilt again return below, open thy mouth,"
5083,CANTO XXVII.,and conceal not that which I conceal not.”

5103,CANTO XXVII.,"become adorned, and flaked with the triumphant vapors[2] that had made"
5104,CANTO XXVII.,"sojourn there with us. My sight was following their semblances, and"
5105,CANTO XXVII.,"followed, till the intermediate space by its greatness pre. vented it"
5106,CANTO XXVII.,"from passing further onward. Whereon my Lady, who saw me disengaged"

5115,CANTO XXVII.,"end;[1] so that I saw beyond Cadiz the mad track of Ulysses, and near"
5116,CANTO XXVII.,on this side the shore[2] on which Europa became a sweet burden. And
5117,CANTO XXVII.,more of the site of this little threshing-floor would have been
5118,CANTO XXVII.,"discovered to me, but the sun was proceeding beneath my feet, a sign"
5119,CANTO XXVII.,and more removed.[3]
5120,CANTO XXVII.,
5121,CANTO XXVII.,"[1] From Dante's first look downward from the Heavens, at the end of"
5122,CANTO XXVII.,"Canto XXII, to the present moment, he had moved over the arc which the"
5123,CANTO XXVII.,first climate describes from its middle to its end. The old geographers
5124,CANTO XXVII.,"divided the earth into seven zones, called climates, by circles"
5125,CANTO XXVII.,parallel to the equator. The first climate extended twenty degrees to
5126,CANTO XXVII.,"the north of the equator. The sign of the Gemini, in which Dante was"
5127,CANTO XXVII.,"revolving in the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, is in the zone of the"
5128,CANTO XXVII.,Heavens corresponding to the first climate. As each climate extended on
5129,CANTO XXVII.,"the habitable hemisphere for one hundred and eighty degrees, the arc"
5130,CANTO XXVII.,"from its middle to its end would be of ninety degrees, comprised"
5131,CANTO XXVII.,"between Jerusalem and Cadiz, and the time required for passing through"
5132,CANTO XXVII.,"it would be six hours, one fourth of the diurnal revolution of the"
5133,CANTO XXVII.,Heavens.

5137,CANTO XXVII.,
5138,CANTO XXVII.,
5139,CANTO XXVII.,[3] The Sun in Aries was separated by Taurus from Gemini; hence not all
5140,CANTO XXVII.,of the hemisphere of the earth seen from Gemini was illuminated by the
5141,CANTO XXVII.,"sun, which was some three hours in advance."
5142,CANTO XXVII.,
5143,CANTO XXVII.,
5144,CANTO XXVII.,"My enamoured mind, that ever dallies with my Lady, was more than ever"
5145,CANTO XXVII.,burning to bring back my eyes to her. And if nature has made bait in
5146,CANTO XXVII.,"human flesh, or art in its paintings, to catch the eyes in order to"
5147,CANTO XXVII.,"possess the mind, all united would seem naught compared to the divine"
5148,CANTO XXVII.,pleasure which shone upon me when I turned me to her smiling face. And
5149,CANTO XXVII.,"the virtue with which the look indulged me, tore me from the fair nest"
5150,CANTO XXVII.,"of Leda,[1] and impelled me to the swiftest heaven.[2]"

5160,CANTO XXVII.,"which of them Beatrice chose for a place for me. But she, who saw my"
5161,CANTO XXVII.,"desire, began, smiling so glad that God seemed to rejoice in her"
5162,CANTO XXVII.,"countenance, “The nature of the world[1] which quiets the centre, and"
5163,CANTO XXVII.,"moves all the rest around it, begins here as from its, starting-point."
5164,CANTO XXVII.,"And this heaven has no other Where than the Divine Mind, in which the"
5165,CANTO XXVII.,"love that revolves it is kindled, and the virtue which it rains down."
5166,CANTO XXVII.,"Light and love enclose it with one circle, even as this does the"
5167,CANTO XXVII.,"others, and of that cincture He who girds it is the sole"
5168,CANTO XXVII.,Intelligence.[2] The motion of this heaven is not marked out by
5169,CANTO XXVII.,"another, but the others are measured by this, even as ten by a half and"
5170,CANTO XXVII.,"by a fifth.[3] And how time can hold its roots in such a flower-pot,"
5171,CANTO XXVII.,"and in the others its leaves, may now be manifest to thee."

5177,CANTO XXVII.,Empyrean God himself is the immediate governor.
5178,CANTO XXVII.,
5179,CANTO XXVII.,
5180,CANTO XXVII.,[3] The reversal of magnitudes makes this image obscure. The motion of
5181,CANTO XXVII.,"the Crystalline Heaven, the swiftest of all, determines the slower"
5182,CANTO XXVII.,"motions of the Heavens below it, and divides them; as five and two"
5183,CANTO XXVII.,divide ten. The fixed unit of time is the day which is established by
5184,CANTO XXVII.,the revolution of the Primum Mobile.

5189,CANTO XXVII.,"will in men, but the continual rain converts the true plums into"
5190,CANTO XXVII.,wildings. Faith and innocence are found only in children; then both fly
5191,CANTO XXVII.,"away ere yet the cheeks are covered. One, so long as he stammers,"
5192,CANTO XXVII.,"fasts, who afterward, when his tongue is loosed, devours whatever food"
5193,CANTO XXVII.,"under whatever moon; and one, while stammering, loves his mother and"
5194,CANTO XXVII.,"listens to her, who, when speech is perfect, desires then to see her"
5195,CANTO XXVII.,buried. So the skin of the fair daughter of him who brings morning and
5196,CANTO XXVII.,"leaves evening, white in its first aspect, becomes black.[2] Do thou,"
5197,CANTO XXVII.,"in order that thou make not marvel, reflect that on earth there is no"
5198,CANTO XXVII.,one who governs; wherefore the human family is gone astray. But ere
5199,CANTO XXVII.,January be all un-wintered by that hundredth part which is down there
5200,CANTO XXVII.,"neglected,[3] these supernal circles shall so roar that the storm which"
5201,CANTO XXVII.,"is so long awaited shall turn the sterns round to where the prows are,"

5205,CANTO XXVII.,[1] The connection of the ideas presented in what precedes with this
5206,CANTO XXVII.,"denunciation of covetousness, or selfishness, is not at first apparent."
5207,CANTO XXVII.,"But the transition is not unnatural, from the consideration of the"
5208,CANTO XXVII.,"Heaven which pours down Divine influence, to the thought of the"

5210,CANTO XXVII.,in which they are blinded to heavenly and eternal good.

5231,CANTO XXVIII.,After she who imparadises my mind had disclosed the truth counter to
5232,CANTO XXVIII.,"the present life of wretched mortals, as he, who is lighted by a candle"
5233,CANTO XXVIII.,"from behind, sees its flame in a mirror before he has it in sight or in"
5234,CANTO XXVIII.,"thought, and turns round to see if the glass tell him the truth, and"
5235,CANTO XXVIII.,sees that it accords with it as the note with its measure;[1] I thus my
5236,CANTO XXVIII.,"memory recollects that I did, looking into the beautiful eyes,"
5237,CANTO XXVIII.,"wherewith Love made the cord to ensnare me.[2] And when I turned, and"
5238,CANTO XXVIII.,mine were touched by that which is apparent in that revolving sphere
5239,CANTO XXVIII.,"whenever one gazes fixedly on its gyration, I saw a Point which was"
5240,CANTO XXVIII.,raying out light so keen that the sight on which it blazes must needs
5241,CANTO XXVIII.,close because of its intense keenness. And whatso star seems smallest
5242,CANTO XXVIII.,"here would seem a moon if placed beside it, as star with star is"
5243,CANTO XXVIII.,placed. Perhaps as near as a halo seems to girdle the light which
5244,CANTO XXVIII.,"paints it, when the vapor that bears it is most dense, at such distance"
5245,CANTO XXVIII.,round the Point a circle of fire was whirling so swiftly that it would
5246,CANTO XXVIII.,have surpassed that motion which with most speed girds the world; and
5247,CANTO XXVIII.,"this was by another circumcinct, and that by the third, and the third"
5248,CANTO XXVIII.,"then by the fourth, by the fifth the fourth, and then by the sixth the"
5249,CANTO XXVIII.,"fifth. Thereon the seventh followed, so spread now in compass that the"
5250,CANTO XXVIII.,messenger of Juno entire[3] would be narrow to contain it. So the
5251,CANTO XXVIII.,"eighth and the ninth; and each was moving more slowly, according as it"
5252,CANTO XXVIII.,was in number more distant from the first.[4] And that one had the
5253,CANTO XXVIII.,clearest flame from which the Pure Spark was least distant; I believe
5254,CANTO XXVIII.,"because it partakes more of It. My Lady, who saw me deeply suspense in"
5255,CANTO XXVIII.,"doubt, said, “On that Point Heaven and all nature are dependent. Gaze"
5256,CANTO XXVIII.,"on that circle which is most conjoined to It, and know that its motion"
5257,CANTO XXVIII.,is so swift because of the burning love whereby it is spurred.” And I
5258,CANTO XXVIII.,"to her, “If the world were set in the order which I see in those"
5259,CANTO XXVIII.,"wheels, that which is propounded to me would have satisfied me; but in"
5260,CANTO XXVIII.,the world of sense the revolutions may be seen so much the more divine
5261,CANTO XXVIII.,as they are more remote from the centre.[5] Wherefore if my desire is
5262,CANTO XXVIII.,"to have end in this marvellous and angelic temple, which has for"
5263,CANTO XXVIII.,"confine only love and light, I need yet to hear why the example and the"
5264,CANTO XXVIII.,"exemplar go not in one fashion, because I by myself contemplate this in"
5265,CANTO XXVIII.,"vain.” “If thy fingers are insufficient for such a knot, it is no"
5266,CANTO XXVIII.,"wonder, so hard has it become through not being tried.” Thus my Lady;"
5267,CANTO XXVIII.,"then she said, “Take that which I shall tell thee, if thou wouldest be"
5268,CANTO XXVIII.,"satisfied, and make subtle thy wit about it. The corporeal circles[6]"
5269,CANTO XXVIII.,are wide and narrow according to the more or less of virtue which is
5270,CANTO XXVIII.,spread through all their parts. Greater goodness must make greater
5271,CANTO XXVIII.,"welfare; the greater body, if it has its parts equally complete,"
5272,CANTO XXVIII.,"contains greater welfare. Hence this one,[7] which sweeps along with"
5273,CANTO XXVIII.,"itself all the rest of the universe, corresponds to the circle[8] which"
5274,CANTO XXVIII.,"loves most, and knows most. Therefore, if thou compassest thy measure"
5275,CANTO XXVIII.,"round the virtue, not round the seeming of the substances which appear"
5276,CANTO XXVIII.,"circular to thee, thou wilt see in each heaven a marvellous agreement"
5277,CANTO XXVIII.,"with its Intelligence, of greater to more and of smaller to less.”[9]"

5308,CANTO XXVIII.,that of those which love and know least.
5309,CANTO XXVIII.,
5310,CANTO XXVIII.,
5311,CANTO XXVIII.,As the hemisphere of the air remains splendid and serene when Boreas
5312,CANTO XXVIII.,"blows from that cheek wherewith he is mildest,[1] whereby the mist"
5313,CANTO XXVIII.,"which first troubled it is cleared and dissolved, so that the heaven"
5314,CANTO XXVIII.,"smiles to us with the beauties of all its flock, so I became after my"
5315,CANTO XXVIII.,"Lady had provided me with her clear answer, and, like a star in heaven,"
5316,CANTO XXVIII.,the truth was seen.

5322,CANTO XXVIII.,"And after her words had stopped, not otherwise does molten iron throw"
5323,CANTO XXVIII.,out sparks than the circles sparkled. Every scintillation followed its
5324,CANTO XXVIII.,"flame,[1] and they were so many that their number, was of more"
5325,CANTO XXVIII.,thousands than the doubling of the chess. I heard Hosaimah sung from
5326,CANTO XXVIII.,"choir to choir to the fixed Point that holds them, and will forever"
5327,CANTO XXVIII.,"hold them, at the Ubi[2] in which they have ever been. And she, who saw"
5328,CANTO XXVIII.,"the dubious thoughts within my mind, said, “The first circles have"
5329,CANTO XXVIII.,shown to thee the Seraphim and the Cherubim. Thus swiftly they follow
5330,CANTO XXVIII.,"their own bonds,[3] in order to liken themselves to the Point so far as"
5331,CANTO XXVIII.,"they can, and they can so far as they are exalted to see. Those other"
5332,CANTO XXVIII.,"loves, which go round about them, are called Thrones of the divine"
5333,CANTO XXVIII.,"aspect, because they terminated the first triad.[4] And thou shouldst"
5334,CANTO XXVIII.,know that all have delight in proportion as their vision penetrates
5335,CANTO XXVIII.,into the True in which every understanding is at rest. Hence may be
5336,CANTO XXVIII.,"seen how beatitude is founded on the act which sees, not on that which"
5337,CANTO XXVIII.,"loves, which follows after. And merit, which grace and good will bring"
5338,CANTO XXVIII.,"forth, is the measure of this seeing; thus is the progress from grade"
5339,CANTO XXVIII.,to grade.
5340,CANTO XXVIII.,
5341,CANTO XXVIII.,[1] The innumerable sparks each moved in accord with the gyration of
5342,CANTO XXVIII.,its flaming circle. The doubling of the chess alludes to the story that
5343,CANTO XXVIII.,"the inventor of the game asked, as his reward from the King of Persia,"
5344,CANTO XXVIII.,"a grain of wheat for the first square of the board, two for the second,"
5345,CANTO XXVIII.,and so on to the last or sixty-fourth square. The number reached by

5364,CANTO XXVIII.,"Then, in the two penultimate dances, the Principalities and Archangels"

5366,CANTO XXVIII.,"upward gazing, and downward prevail, so that toward God they all are"
5367,CANTO XXVIII.,"drawn, and they all draw. And Dionysius[2] with such great desire set"
5368,CANTO XXVIII.,"himself to contemplate these orders, that he named and divided them, as"
5369,CANTO XXVIII.,"I. But Gregory[3] afterward separated from him; wherefore, so soon as"
5370,CANTO XXVIII.,"he opened his eyes in this Heaven, he smiled at himself. And if a"

5403,CANTO XXIX.,"countenance painted with a smile, was Beatrice silent, looking fixedly"
5404,CANTO XXIX.,"upon the Point which had overcome me. Then she began: “I speak, and I"
5405,CANTO XXIX.,"ask not what thou wishest to hear, for I have seen it where every WHERE"
5406,CANTO XXIX.,"and every WHEN are centred. Not for the gain of good unto Himself,"
5407,CANTO XXIX.,"which cannot be, but that His splendor might, in resplendence, say,"
5408,CANTO XXIX.,"Subsisto; in His own eternity, outside of time, outside of every other"
5409,CANTO XXIX.,"limit, as pleased Him, the Eternal Love disclosed Himself in new loves."
5410,CANTO XXIX.,"Nor before, as if inert, did He lie; for the going forth of God upon"
5411,CANTO XXIX.,these waters had proceeded neither before nor after.[2] Form and
5412,CANTO XXIX.,"matter, conjoined and simple, came forth to existence which had no"
5413,CANTO XXIX.,"defect, as three arrows from a three-stringed bow; and as in glass, in"
5414,CANTO XXIX.,"amber, or in crystal a ray shines so that there is no interval between"
5415,CANTO XXIX.,"its coining and its complete existence, so the triform effect[3] rayed"
5416,CANTO XXIX.,"forth from its Lord into its. existence all at once, without"
5417,CANTO XXIX.,"discrimination of beginning. Order was concreate, and established for"
5418,CANTO XXIX.,"the substances, and those were top of the world in which pure act was"
5419,CANTO XXIX.,produced.[4] Pure potency held the lowest part;[5] in the middle such a
5420,CANTO XXIX.,"bond unites potency with act, that it is never unbound.[6] Jerome has"
5421,CANTO XXIX.,"written to you of the Angels, created a long tract of centuries before"
5422,CANTO XXIX.,the rest of the world was made. But this truth[7] is written on many
5423,CANTO XXIX.,pages by the writers of the that Holy Spirit: and thou wilt thyself
5424,CANTO XXIX.,"discover it, if thou watchest well for it; and even the reason sees it"
5425,CANTO XXIX.,"somewhat, for it would not admit that the motors could be so long"
5426,CANTO XXIX.,without their perfection.[8] Now thou knowest where and when these
5427,CANTO XXIX.,"loves were elected, and how; so that three flames of thy desire are"
5428,CANTO XXIX.,already quenched.
5429,CANTO XXIX.,
5430,CANTO XXIX.,"[1] When at the spring equinox, the sun being in the sign of Aries or"
5431,CANTO XXIX.,"the Ram, and the moon in that of Libra or the Scales, opposite to each"
5432,CANTO XXIX.,"other on the horizon, the one just rising and the other setting, they"
5433,CANTO XXIX.,seem as if held for a moment in a balance which hangs from the zenith.
5434,CANTO XXIX.,
5435,CANTO XXIX.,

5450,CANTO XXIX.,
5451,CANTO XXIX.,

5455,CANTO XXIX.,
5456,CANTO XXIX.,"[7] The truth here set forth (contrary to Jerome's assertion), the"
5457,CANTO XXIX.,creation of the Angels was contemporaneous with that of the creation of
5458,CANTO XXIX.,the rest of the Universe of which they were the Intelligences.

5466,CANTO XXIX.,"began this art which thou beboldest, with such great delight that they"
5467,CANTO XXIX.,never cease from circling. The origin of the fall was the accursed
5468,CANTO XXIX.,pride of him whom thou hast seen opprest by all the weights of the
5469,CANTO XXIX.,world. Those whom thou seest here were modest in grateful recognition
5470,CANTO XXIX.,of the goodness which had made them ready for intelligence so great;
5471,CANTO XXIX.,wherefore their vision was exalted with illuminant grace and with their
5472,CANTO XXIX.,"merit, so that they have full and steadfast will. And I wish that thou"
5473,CANTO XXIX.,"doubt not, but be certain, that to receive grace is meritorious in"

5481,CANTO XXIX.,because on earth it is taught in your schools that the angelic nature
5482,CANTO XXIX.,"is such that it understands, and remembers, and wills, I will speak"
5483,CANTO XXIX.,"further, in order that thou mayest see the truth pure, which there"
5484,CANTO XXIX.,"below is mixed, through the equivocation in such like teaching. These"
5485,CANTO XXIX.,"substances, from the time that they were glad in the face of God, have"
5486,CANTO XXIX.,"not turned their sight from it, from which nothing is concealed."
5487,CANTO XXIX.,"Therefore they have not their vision interrupted by a new object, and"
5488,CANTO XXIX.,therefore do not need because of divided thought to recollect.[1] So
5489,CANTO XXIX.,"that there below men dream when not asleep, believing and not believing"
5490,CANTO XXIX.,to speak truth; but in the one is more fault and more shame.[2] Ye
5491,CANTO XXIX.,below go not along one path in philosophizing; so much do the love of
5492,CANTO XXIX.,appearance[3] and the thought of it transport you; and yet this is
5493,CANTO XXIX.,endured hereabove with less indignation than when the divine Scripture
5494,CANTO XXIX.,"is set aside, or when it is perverted. Men think not there how much"
5495,CANTO XXIX.,"blood it costs to sow it in the world, and how much he pleases who"
5496,CANTO XXIX.,"humbly keeps close to its side. Every one strives for appearance, and"
5497,CANTO XXIX.,"makes his own inventions, and those are discoursed of by the preachers,"
5498,CANTO XXIX.,and the Gospel is silent. One says that the moon turned back at the
5499,CANTO XXIX.,"passion of Christ and interposed herself, so that the light of the sun"
5500,CANTO XXIX.,reached not down; and others that the light hid itself of its own
5501,CANTO XXIX.,"accord, so that this eclipse answered for the Spaniards and for the"
5502,CANTO XXIX.,Indians as well as for the Jews. Florence hath not so many Lapi and
5503,CANTO XXIX.,Bindi[4] as there are fables such as these shouted the year long from
5504,CANTO XXIX.,"the pulpits, on every side; so that the poor flocks, who have no"
5505,CANTO XXIX.,"knowledge, return from the pasture fed with wind; and not seeing the"
5506,CANTO XXIX.,"harm does not excuse them. Christ did not say to his first company,"
5507,CANTO XXIX.,"'Go, and preach idle stories to the world,' but he gave to them the"
5508,CANTO XXIX.,"true foundation; and that alone sounded in their cheeks, so that in the"
5509,CANTO XXIX.,battle for kindling of the faith they made shield and lance of the
5510,CANTO XXIX.,"Gospel. Now men go forth to preach with jests and with buffooneries,"
5511,CANTO XXIX.,"and provided only there is a good laugh the cowl puffs up, and nothing"
5512,CANTO XXIX.,"more is required. But such a bird is nesting in the tail of the hood,"
5513,CANTO XXIX.,"that if the crowd should see it, they would see the pardon in which"
5514,CANTO XXIX.,"they confide; through which such great folly has grown on earth, that,"
5515,CANTO XXIX.,"without proof of any testimony, men would flock to every indulgence. On"
5516,CANTO XXIX.,"this the pig of St. Antony fattens, and others also, who are far more"

5539,CANTO XXIX.,concept that could go so far. And if thou considerest that which is
5540,CANTO XXIX.,revealed by Daniel thou wilt see that in his thousands[2] a determinate
5541,CANTO XXIX.,number is concealed. The primal light that irradiates it all is
5542,CANTO XXIX.,received in it by as many modes as are the splendors with which the
5543,CANTO XXIX.,"light pairs itself.[3] Wherefore, since the affection follows upon the"
5544,CANTO XXIX.,"act[4] that conceives, in this nature the sweetness of love diversely"
5545,CANTO XXIX.,glows and warms. Behold now the height and the breadth of the Eternal

5572,CANTO XXX.,"and this world now inclines its shadow almost to a level bed, when the"
5573,CANTO XXX.,"mid heaven, deep above us, begins to become such that some one star"
5574,CANTO XXX.,loses its show so far as to this depth;[1] and as the brightest
5575,CANTO XXX.,"handmaid of the sun comes farther on, so the heaven is closed from"
5576,CANTO XXX.,"light to light, even to the most beautiful. Not otherwise the Triumph,"
5577,CANTO XXX.,"that plays forever round the Point which vanquished me, seeming"
5578,CANTO XXX.,"enclosed by that which it encloses, little by little to my sight was"
5579,CANTO XXX.,"extinguished;[2] wherefore my seeing nothing, and my love constrained"
5580,CANTO XXX.,me to turn with my eyes to Beatrice. If what has been said of her so
5581,CANTO XXX.,"far as here were all included in a single praise, it would be little to"
5582,CANTO XXX.,furnish out this turn. The beauty which I saw transcends measure not
5583,CANTO XXX.,"only by us, but truly I believe that its Maker alone can enjoy it all."
5584,CANTO XXX.,
5585,CANTO XXX.,"[1] When it is noon,—the sixth hour,—six thousand miles away from us to"
5586,CANTO XXX.,"the east, it is about daybreak where we are; the shadow of the earth"

5597,CANTO XXX.,deprives my mind of its very self. From the first day that I saw her
5598,CANTO XXX.,"face in this life, even to this look, the following with my song has"
5599,CANTO XXX.,"not been interrupted for me, but now needs must my pursuit desist from"

5607,CANTO XXX.,"of love, love of true good, full of joy; joy which transcends every"

5626,CANTO XXX.,"vivid light shone round about me, and left me swathed with such a veil"
5627,CANTO XXX.,of its own effulgence that nothing was visible to me.
5628,CANTO XXX.,

5631,CANTO XXX.,“The Love which quieteth this Heaven always welcomes to itself with
5632,CANTO XXX.,"such a salutation, in order to make the candle ready for its flame.” No"
5633,CANTO XXX.,sooner had these brief words come within me than I comprehended that I
5634,CANTO XXX.,was surmounting above my own power; and I rekindled me with a new
5635,CANTO XXX.,"vision, such that no light is so pure that my eyes had not sustained"
5636,CANTO XXX.,"it. And I saw light in form of a river, bright with effulgence, between"
5637,CANTO XXX.,two banks painted with a marvellous spring. Out of this stream were
5638,CANTO XXX.,"issuing living sparks, and on every side were setting themselves in the"
5639,CANTO XXX.,"flowers, like rubies which gold encompasses. Then, as if inebriated by"
5640,CANTO XXX.,"the odors, they plunged again into the wonderful flood, and as one was"

5646,CANTO XXX.,"thirst, in thee be slaked.” Thus the Sun of my eyes said to me; thereon"
5647,CANTO XXX.,"she added, “The stream, and the topazes which enter and issue, and the"
5648,CANTO XXX.,"smiling of the herbage, are foreshadowing prefaces of their truth;[1]"

5662,CANTO XXX.,"of my eyes, stooping to the wave which flows in order that one may be"
5663,CANTO XXX.,"bettered in it. And even as the eaves of my eyelids drank of it, so it"
5664,CANTO XXX.,seemed to me from its length to become round. Then as folk who have
5665,CANTO XXX.,"been under masks, who seem other than before, if they divest themselves"
5666,CANTO XXX.,"of the semblance not their own in which they disappeared, thus for me"
5667,CANTO XXX.,"the flowers and the sparks were changed into greater festival, so that"

5669,CANTO XXX.,

5676,CANTO XXX.,girdle for the sun. Its whole appearance is made of a ray reflected
5677,CANTO XXX.,"from the summit of the First Moving Heaven,[1] which therefrom takes"
5678,CANTO XXX.,its life and potency. And as a hill mirrors itself in water at its
5679,CANTO XXX.,"base, as if to see itself adorned, rich as it is with verdure and with"
5680,CANTO XXX.,"flowers, so ranged above the light, round and round about, on more than"
5681,CANTO XXX.,"a thousand seats, I saw mirrored all who of us have returned on high."
5682,CANTO XXX.,"And if the lowest row gather within itself so great a light, how vast"
5683,CANTO XXX.,is the spread of this rose in its outermost leaves! My sight lost not
5684,CANTO XXX.,"itself in the breadth and in the height, but took in all the quantity"
5685,CANTO XXX.,and the quality of that joy. There near and far nor add nor take away;

5694,CANTO XXX.,"drew me, and said, “Behold, how vast is the convent of the white"

5762,CANTO XXXI.,"Surely what with it and the joy I was well pleased not to hear, and to"

5764,CANTO XXXI.,"in looking round, and hopes now to report how it was, so, journeying"
5765,CANTO XXXI.,"through the living light, I carried my eyes over the ranks, now up, now"
5766,CANTO XXXI.,"down, and now circling about. I saw faces persuasive to love,"

5783,CANTO XXXI.,re-enkindled wish to ask my Lady about things concerning which my mind
5784,CANTO XXXI.,"was in suspense. One thing I was meaning, and another answered me; I"
5785,CANTO XXXI.,"was thinking to see Beatrice, and I saw an old man, robed like the"
5786,CANTO XXXI.,people in glory. His eyes and his cheeks were overspread with benignant
5787,CANTO XXXI.,"joy, in pious mien such as befits a tender father. And, “Where is she?”"
5788,CANTO XXXI.,"on a sudden said I. Whereon he, “To terminate thy desire, Beatrice"
5789,CANTO XXXI.,"urged me from my place, and if thou lookest up to the third circle from"
5790,CANTO XXXI.,"the highest step, thou wilt again see her upon the throne which her"
5791,CANTO XXXI.,"merits have allotted to her.” Without answering I lifted up my eyes,"
5792,CANTO XXXI.,"and saw her as she made for herself a crown, reflecting from herself"
5793,CANTO XXXI.,the eternal rays. From that region which thunders highest up no mortal
5794,CANTO XXXI.,"eye is so far distant, in whatsoever sea it loses itself the lowest,[1]"
5795,CANTO XXXI.,"as there from Beatrice was my sight. But this was naught to me, for her"

5811,CANTO XXXI.,"And the holy old man, “In order that thou mayest complete perfectly,”"

5836,CANTO XXXI.,"circles even to the most remote, until thou seest upon her seat the"
5837,CANTO XXXI.,Queen to whom this realm is subject and devoted.” I lifted up my eyes;
5838,CANTO XXXI.,and as at morning the eastern parts of the horizon surpass that where
5839,CANTO XXXI.,"the sun declines, thus, as if going with my eyes from valley to"
5840,CANTO XXXI.,"mountain, I saw a part on the extreme verge vanquishing in light all"
5841,CANTO XXXI.,the other front. And even as there where the pole which Phaeton guided
5842,CANTO XXXI.,"ill is awaited,[1] the flame is brighter, and on this side and that the"
5843,CANTO XXXI.,"light grows less, so that pacific oriflamme was vivid at the middle,"
5844,CANTO XXXI.,and on each side in equal measure the flame slackened. And at that mid
5845,CANTO XXXI.,"part I saw more than a thousand jubilant Angels with wings outspread,"
5846,CANTO XXXI.,"each distinct both in brightness and in act. I saw there, smiling at"
5847,CANTO XXXI.,"their sports and at their songs, a Beauty[2] which was joy in the eyes"
5848,CANTO XXXI.,of all the other saints. And if I had such wealth in speech as in
5849,CANTO XXXI.,"imagining, I should. not dare to attempt the least of its"
5850,CANTO XXXI.,"delightfulness. Bernard, when he saw my eyes fixed and intent upon its"
5851,CANTO XXXI.,"warm glow, turned his own with such affection to it, that he made mine"

5873,CANTO XXXII.,"who opened it and who pierced it. Beneath her, in the order which the"

5875,CANTO XXXII.,"Rebecca, Judith, and she[1] who was great-grandmother of the singer"
5876,CANTO XXXII.,"who, through sorrow for his sin, said Miserere mei,[2] thou mayest see"
5877,CANTO XXXII.,"thus from step to step in gradation downward, as with the name of each"
5878,CANTO XXXII.,I go downward through the rose from leaf to leaf. And from the seventh
5879,CANTO XXXII.,"row downwards, even as down to it, Hebrew women follow in succession,"
5880,CANTO XXXII.,dividing all the tresses of the flower; because these are the wall by
5881,CANTO XXXII.,which the sacred stairways are separated according to the look which
5882,CANTO XXXII.,"faith turned on Christ. On this side, where the flower is mature with"
5883,CANTO XXXII.,"all its leaves, are seated those who believed in Christ about to come."
5884,CANTO XXXII.,"On the other side, where the semicircles are broken by empty spaces,"
5885,CANTO XXXII.,are those who turned their faces on Christ already come.[3] And as on
5886,CANTO XXXII.,"this side the glorious seat of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats"
5887,CANTO XXXII.,"below it, make so great a division, thus, opposite, does that of the"
5888,CANTO XXXII.,"great John, who, ever holy, endured the desert and martyrdom, and then"
5889,CANTO XXXII.,Hell for two years;[4] and beneath him Francis and Benedict and
5890,CANTO XXXII.,"Augustine and others are allotted thfis to divide, far down as here"
5891,CANTO XXXII.,from circle to circle. Now behold the high divine foresight; for one
5892,CANTO XXXII.,and the other aspect of the faith will fill this garden equally. And
5893,CANTO XXXII.,know that downwards from the row which midway cleaves[5] the two
5894,CANTO XXXII.,"divisions, they are seated for no merit of their own, but for that of"
5895,CANTO XXXII.,"others, under certain conditions; for all these are spirits absolved"
5896,CANTO XXXII.,"ere they had true election. Well canst thou perceive it by their looks,"
5897,CANTO XXXII.,"and also by their childish voices, if thou lookest well upon them and"
5898,CANTO XXXII.,"if thou listenest to them. Now thou art perplexed, and in perplexity"
5899,CANTO XXXII.,art silent; but I will loose for thee the strong bond in which thy
5900,CANTO XXXII.,subtile thoughts fetter thee.[6] Within the amplitude of this realm a
5901,CANTO XXXII.,"casual point can have no place,[7] any more than sadness, or thirst, or"
5902,CANTO XXXII.,"hunger; for whatever thou seest is established by eternal law, so that"
5903,CANTO XXXII.,here the ring answers exactly to the finger. And therefore this
5904,CANTO XXXII.,"folk,[8] hastened to true life, is not sine causa more and less"
5905,CANTO XXXII.,excellent here among itself. The King through whom this realm reposes
5906,CANTO XXXII.,in such great love and in such great delight that no will is
5907,CANTO XXXII.,"venturesome for more, creating all the minds in His own glad aspect,"
5908,CANTO XXXII.,diversely endows with grace according to His own pleasure; and here let
5909,CANTO XXXII.,the fact suffice.[9] And this is expressly and clearly noted for you in
5910,CANTO XXXII.,"the Holy Scripture in those twins who, while within their mother, had"
5911,CANTO XXXII.,"their anger roused.[10] Therefore, according to the color of the hair"

5915,CANTO XXXII.,vision.[12] Thus in the fresh centuries the faith of parents alone
5916,CANTO XXXII.,"sufficed, together with innocence, to secure salvation. After the first"
5917,CANTO XXXII.,"ages were, complete, it was needful for males with their innocent"
5918,CANTO XXXII.,plumage to acquire virtue through circumcision. But after the time of
5919,CANTO XXXII.,"grace had come, without perfect baptism in Christ, such minocence was"

6003,CANTO XXXII.,"the other rests that leader, under whom the ingrate, fickle and"

6103,CANTO XXXIII.,"my memory and by sounding a little in these verses, more of Thy victory"
6104,CANTO XXXIII.,shall be conceived.
6105,CANTO XXXIII.,
6106,CANTO XXXIII.,"I think that by the keenness of the living ray which I endured, I"
6107,CANTO XXXIII.,should have been bewildered if my eyes had been averted from it. And it
6108,CANTO XXXIII.,comes to my mind that for this reason I was the more hardy to sustain
6109,CANTO XXXIII.,"so much, that I joined my look unto the Infinite Goodness."
6110,CANTO XXXIII.,
6111,CANTO XXXIII.,"O abundant Grace, whereby I presumed to fix my eyes through the Eternal"
6112,CANTO XXXIII.,Light so far that there I consumed my sight!
6113,CANTO XXXIII.,
6114,CANTO XXXIII.,In its depth I saw that whatsoever is dispersed through the universe is
6115,CANTO XXXIII.,"there included, bound with love in one volume; substance and accidents"
6116,CANTO XXXIII.,"and their modes, fused together, as it were, in such wise, that that of"
6117,CANTO XXXIII.,which I speak is one simple Light. The universal form of this knot[1] I
6118,CANTO XXXIII.,"believe that I saw, because in saying this I feel that I more at large"
6119,CANTO XXXIII.,rejoice. One instant only is greater oblivion for me than five and
6120,CANTO XXXIII.,twenty centuries to the emprise which made Neptune wonder at the shadow
6121,CANTO XXXIII.,of Argo.[2]
6122,CANTO XXXIII.,
6123,CANTO XXXIII.,[1] This union of substance and accident and their modes; the unity of
6124,CANTO XXXIII.,creation in the Creator.
6125,CANTO XXXIII.,
6126,CANTO XXXIII.,
6127,CANTO XXXIII.,"[2] The mysteries of God vanish in an instant from memory, but the"
6128,CANTO XXXIII.,larger joy felt in recording them is proof that they were seen.
6129,CANTO XXXIII.,
6130,CANTO XXXIII.,
6131,CANTO XXXIII.,"Thus my mind, wholly rapt, was gazing fixed, motionless, and intent,"
6132,CANTO XXXIII.,and ever with gazing grew enkindled. In that Light one becomes such
6133,CANTO XXXIII.,that it is impossible he should ever consent to turn himself from it
6134,CANTO XXXIII.,for other sight; because the Good which is the object of the will is
6135,CANTO XXXIII.,"all collected in it, and outside of it that is defective which is"
6136,CANTO XXXIII.,perfect there.
6137,CANTO XXXIII.,
6138,CANTO XXXIII.,"Now will my speech be shorter, even in respect to that which I"
6139,CANTO XXXIII.,"remember, than an infant's who still bathes his tongue at the breast."
6140,CANTO XXXIII.,Not because more than one simple semblance was in the Living Light
6141,CANTO XXXIII.,"wherein I was gazing, which is always such as it was before; but"
6142,CANTO XXXIII.,"through my sight, which was growing strong in me as I looked, one sole"
6143,CANTO XXXIII.,"appearance, as I myself changed, was altering itself to me."
6144,CANTO XXXIII.,
6145,CANTO XXXIII.,Within the profound and clear subsistence of the lofty Light appeared
6146,CANTO XXXIII.,to me three circles of three colors and of one dimension; and one
6147,CANTO XXXIII.,"appeared reflected by the other, as Iris by Iris,[1] and the third"
6148,CANTO XXXIII.,appeared fire which from the one and from the other is equally breathed
6149,CANTO XXXIII.,forth.
6150,CANTO XXXIII.,
6151,CANTO XXXIII.,[1] As one arch of the rainbow by the other.
6152,CANTO XXXIII.,
6153,CANTO XXXIII.,
6154,CANTO XXXIII.,"O how short is the telling, and how feeble toward my conception! and"
6155,CANTO XXXIII.,this toward what I saw is such that it suffices not to call it little.
6156,CANTO XXXIII.,
6157,CANTO XXXIII.,"O Light Eternal, that sole dwellest in Thyself, sole understandest"
6158,CANTO XXXIII.,"Thyself, and, by Thyself understood and understanding, lovest and"
6159,CANTO XXXIII.,"smilest on Thyself! That circle, which, thus conceived, appeared in"
6160,CANTO XXXIII.,"Thee as a reflected light, being somewhile regarded by my eyes, seemed"
6161,CANTO XXXIII.,"to me depicted within itself, of its own very color, by our effigy,"
6162,CANTO XXXIII.,wherefore my sight was wholly set upon it. As is the geometer who
6163,CANTO XXXIII.,"wholly applies himself to measure the circle, and finds not by thinking"
6164,CANTO XXXIII.,"that principle of which he is in need, such was I at that new sight. I"
6165,CANTO XXXIII.,"wished to see how the image accorded with the circle, and how it has"
6166,CANTO XXXIII.,"its place therein; but my own wings were not for this, had it not been"
6167,CANTO XXXIII.,that my mind was smitten by a flash in which its wish came.
6168,CANTO XXXIII.,
6169,CANTO XXXIII.,"To my high fantasy here power failed; but now my desire and my will,"
6170,CANTO XXXIII.,"like a wheel which evenly is moved, the Lovee was turning which moves"
6171,CANTO XXXIII.,the Sun and the other stars.
6172,CANTO XXXIII.,
6173,CANTO XXXIII.,
6174,CANTO XXXIII.,
6175,CANTO XXXIII.,
6176,CANTO XXXIII.,
6177,CANTO XXXIII.,
