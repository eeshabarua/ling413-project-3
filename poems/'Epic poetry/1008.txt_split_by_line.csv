136,CANTO I,
137,CANTO I,"In the midway of this our mortal life,"
138,CANTO I,"I found me in a gloomy wood, astray"
139,CANTO I,Gone from the path direct: and e’en to tell
140,CANTO I,"It were no easy task, how savage wild"
141,CANTO I,"That forest, how robust and rough its growth,"
142,CANTO I,"Which to remember only, my dismay"
143,CANTO I,"Renews, in bitterness not far from death."
144,CANTO I,"Yet to discourse of what there good befell,"
145,CANTO I,All else will I relate discover’d there.
146,CANTO I,"How first I enter’d it I scarce can say,"
147,CANTO I,Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh’d
148,CANTO I,"My senses down, when the true path I left,"
149,CANTO I,"But when a mountain’s foot I reach’d, where clos’d"
150,CANTO I,"The valley, that had pierc’d my heart with dread,"
151,CANTO I,"I look’d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad"
152,CANTO I,"Already vested with that planet’s beam,"
153,CANTO I,Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.
154,CANTO I,
155,CANTO I,"Then was a little respite to the fear,"
156,CANTO I,"That in my heart’s recesses deep had lain,"
157,CANTO I,"All of that night, so pitifully pass’d:"
158,CANTO I,"And as a man, with difficult short breath,"
159,CANTO I,"Forespent with toiling, ’scap’d from sea to shore,"
160,CANTO I,"Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands"
161,CANTO I,"At gaze; e’en so my spirit, that yet fail’d"
162,CANTO I,"Struggling with terror, turn’d to view the straits,"
163,CANTO I,That none hath pass’d and liv’d. My weary frame
164,CANTO I,"After short pause recomforted, again"
165,CANTO I,"I journey’d on over that lonely steep,"
166,CANTO I,The hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent
167,CANTO I,"Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,"
168,CANTO I,"And cover’d with a speckled skin, appear’d,"
169,CANTO I,"Nor, when it saw me, vanish’d, rather strove"
170,CANTO I,To check my onward going; that ofttimes
171,CANTO I,With purpose to retrace my steps I turn’d.
172,CANTO I,
173,CANTO I,"The hour was morning’s prime, and on his way"
174,CANTO I,"Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,"
175,CANTO I,"That with him rose, when Love divine first mov’d"
176,CANTO I,Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope
177,CANTO I,"All things conspir’d to fill me, the gay skin"
178,CANTO I,"Of that swift animal, the matin dawn"
179,CANTO I,"And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas’d,"
180,CANTO I,"And by new dread succeeded, when in view"
181,CANTO I,"A lion came, ’gainst me, as it appear’d,"
182,CANTO I,"With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,"
183,CANTO I,That e’en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf
184,CANTO I,"Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem’d"
185,CANTO I,"Full of all wants, and many a land hath made"
186,CANTO I,Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear
187,CANTO I,"O’erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall’d,"
188,CANTO I,"That of the height all hope I lost. As one,"
189,CANTO I,"Who with his gain elated, sees the time"
190,CANTO I,"When all unwares is gone, he inwardly"
191,CANTO I,"Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,"
192,CANTO I,"Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,"
193,CANTO I,"Who coming o’er against me, by degrees"
194,CANTO I,Impell’d me where the sun in silence rests.
195,CANTO I,
196,CANTO I,While to the lower space with backward step
197,CANTO I,"I fell, my ken discern’d the form one of one,"
198,CANTO I,Whose voice seem’d faint through long disuse of speech.
199,CANTO I,"When him in that great desert I espied,"
200,CANTO I,"“Have mercy on me!” cried I out aloud,"
201,CANTO I,“Spirit! or living man! what e’er thou be!”
202,CANTO I,
203,CANTO I,"He answer’d: “Now not man, man once I was,"
204,CANTO I,"And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both"
205,CANTO I,"By country, when the power of Julius yet"
206,CANTO I,Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past
207,CANTO I,"Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time"
208,CANTO I,Of fabled deities and false. A bard
209,CANTO I,"Was I, and made Anchises’ upright son"
210,CANTO I,"The subject of my song, who came from Troy,"
211,CANTO I,When the flames prey’d on Ilium’s haughty towers.
212,CANTO I,"But thou, say wherefore to such perils past"
213,CANTO I,Return’st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount
214,CANTO I,"Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?”"
215,CANTO I,"“And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,"
216,CANTO I,From which such copious floods of eloquence
217,CANTO I,Have issued?” I with front abash’d replied.
218,CANTO I,“Glory and light of all the tuneful train!
219,CANTO I,May it avail me that I long with zeal
220,CANTO I,"Have sought thy volume, and with love immense"
221,CANTO I,Have conn’d it o’er. My master thou and guide!
222,CANTO I,Thou he from whom alone I have deriv’d
223,CANTO I,"That style, which for its beauty into fame"
224,CANTO I,"Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled."
225,CANTO I,"O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!"
226,CANTO I,For every vein and pulse throughout my frame
227,CANTO I,"She hath made tremble.” He, soon as he saw"
228,CANTO I,"That I was weeping, answer’d, “Thou must needs"
229,CANTO I,"Another way pursue, if thou wouldst ’scape"
230,CANTO I,"From out that savage wilderness. This beast,"
231,CANTO I,"At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none"
232,CANTO I,"To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:"
233,CANTO I,"So bad and so accursed in her kind,"
234,CANTO I,"That never sated is her ravenous will,"
235,CANTO I,Still after food more craving than before.
236,CANTO I,To many an animal in wedlock vile
237,CANTO I,"She fastens, and shall yet to many more,"
238,CANTO I,"Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy"
239,CANTO I,Her with sharp pain. He will not life support
240,CANTO I,"By earth nor its base metals, but by love,"
241,CANTO I,"Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be"
242,CANTO I,The land ’twixt either Feltro. In his might
243,CANTO I,"Shall safety to Italia’s plains arise,"
244,CANTO I,"For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,"
245,CANTO I,"Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell."
246,CANTO I,He with incessant chase through every town
247,CANTO I,"Shall worry, until he to hell at length"
248,CANTO I,"Restore her, thence by envy first let loose."
249,CANTO I,"I for thy profit pond’ring now devise,"
250,CANTO I,"That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide"
251,CANTO I,"Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,"
252,CANTO I,"Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see"
253,CANTO I,"Spirits of old tormented, who invoke"
254,CANTO I,"A second death; and those next view, who dwell"
255,CANTO I,"Content in fire, for that they hope to come,"
256,CANTO I,"Whene’er the time may be, among the blest,"
257,CANTO I,Into whose regions if thou then desire
258,CANTO I,"T’ ascend, a spirit worthier then I"
259,CANTO I,"Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,"
260,CANTO I,"Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,"
261,CANTO I,"Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,"
262,CANTO I,"Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,"
263,CANTO I,That to his city none through me should come.
264,CANTO I,"He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds"
265,CANTO I,"His citadel and throne. O happy those,"
266,CANTO I,Whom there he chooses!” I to him in few:
267,CANTO I,"“Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,"
268,CANTO I,I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse
269,CANTO I,"I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,"
270,CANTO I,"That I Saint Peter’s gate may view, and those"
271,CANTO I,"Who as thou tell’st, are in such dismal plight.”"
272,CANTO I,
273,CANTO I,"Onward he mov’d, I close his steps pursu’d."
274,CANTO I,
275,CANTO I,
276,CANTO I,
277,CANTO I,
278,CANTO II,CANTO II
279,CANTO II,
280,CANTO II,
281,CANTO II,"Now was the day departing, and the air,"
282,CANTO II,"Imbrown’d with shadows, from their toils releas’d"
283,CANTO II,All animals on earth; and I alone
284,CANTO II,"Prepar’d myself the conflict to sustain,"
285,CANTO II,"Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,"
286,CANTO II,Which my unerring memory shall retrace.
287,CANTO II,
288,CANTO II,O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe
289,CANTO II,Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept
290,CANTO II,"Safe in a written record, here thy worth"
291,CANTO II,And eminent endowments come to proof.
292,CANTO II,
293,CANTO II,"I thus began: “Bard! thou who art my guide,"
294,CANTO II,"Consider well, if virtue be in me"
295,CANTO II,"Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise"
296,CANTO II,"Thou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius’ sire,"
297,CANTO II,"Yet cloth’d in corruptible flesh, among"
298,CANTO II,"Th’ immortal tribes had entrance, and was there"
299,CANTO II,"Sensible present. Yet if heaven’s great Lord,"
300,CANTO II,"Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew’d,"
301,CANTO II,"In contemplation of the high effect,"
302,CANTO II,"Both what and who from him should issue forth,"
303,CANTO II,It seems in reason’s judgment well deserv’d:
304,CANTO II,"Sith he of Rome, and of Rome’s empire wide,"
305,CANTO II,In heaven’s empyreal height was chosen sire:
306,CANTO II,"Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain’d"
307,CANTO II,"And ’stablish’d for the holy place, where sits"
308,CANTO II,Who to great Peter’s sacred chair succeeds.
309,CANTO II,"He from this journey, in thy song renown’d,"
310,CANTO II,"Learn’d things, that to his victory gave rise"
311,CANTO II,And to the papal robe. In after-times
312,CANTO II,"The chosen vessel also travel’d there,"
313,CANTO II,"To bring us back assurance in that faith,"
314,CANTO II,Which is the entrance to salvation’s way.
315,CANTO II,"But I, why should I there presume? or who"
316,CANTO II,"Permits it? not, Aeneas I nor Paul."
317,CANTO II,"Myself I deem not worthy, and none else"
318,CANTO II,"Will deem me. I, if on this voyage then"
319,CANTO II,"I venture, fear it will in folly end."
320,CANTO II,"Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know’st,"
321,CANTO II,"Than I can speak.” As one, who unresolves"
322,CANTO II,"What he hath late resolv’d, and with new thoughts"
323,CANTO II,"Changes his purpose, from his first intent"
324,CANTO II,"Remov’d; e’en such was I on that dun coast,"
325,CANTO II,"Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first"
326,CANTO II,So eagerly embrac’d. “If right thy words
327,CANTO II,"I scan,” replied that shade magnanimous,"
328,CANTO II,"“Thy soul is by vile fear assail’d, which oft"
329,CANTO II,"So overcasts a man, that he recoils"
330,CANTO II,"From noblest resolution, like a beast"
331,CANTO II,At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.
332,CANTO II,"That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,"
333,CANTO II,"I will instruct thee why I came, and what"
334,CANTO II,"I heard in that same instant, when for thee"
335,CANTO II,"Grief touch’d me first. I was among the tribe,"
336,CANTO II,"Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest"
337,CANTO II,"And lovely, I besought her to command,"
338,CANTO II,Call’d me; her eyes were brighter than the star
339,CANTO II,Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft
340,CANTO II,Angelically tun’d her speech address’d:
341,CANTO II,“O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame
342,CANTO II,"Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!"
343,CANTO II,"A friend, not of my fortune but myself,"
344,CANTO II,On the wide desert in his road has met
345,CANTO II,"Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn’d."
346,CANTO II,"Now much I dread lest he past help have stray’d,"
347,CANTO II,"And I be ris’n too late for his relief,"
348,CANTO II,"From what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,"
349,CANTO II,"And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,"
350,CANTO II,"And by all means for his deliverance meet,"
351,CANTO II,Assist him. So to me will comfort spring.
352,CANTO II,I who now bid thee on this errand forth
353,CANTO II,Am Beatrice; from a place I come
354,CANTO II,"Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence,"
355,CANTO II,Who prompts my speech. When in my Master’s sight
356,CANTO II,"I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.”"
357,CANTO II,
358,CANTO II,"(Note: Beatrice. I use this word, as it is pronounced in the Italian,"
359,CANTO II,"as consisting of four syllables, of which the third is a long one.)"
360,CANTO II,
361,CANTO II,
362,CANTO II,"She then was silent, and I thus began:"
363,CANTO II,"“O Lady! by whose influence alone,"
364,CANTO II,Mankind excels whatever is contain’d
365,CANTO II,"Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,"
366,CANTO II,"So thy command delights me, that to obey,"
367,CANTO II,"If it were done already, would seem late."
368,CANTO II,No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;
369,CANTO II,"Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth"
370,CANTO II,"To leave that ample space, where to return"
371,CANTO II,"Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.”"
372,CANTO II,
373,CANTO II,"She then: “Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,"
374,CANTO II,"I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread"
375,CANTO II,Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone
376,CANTO II,"Are to be fear’d, whence evil may proceed,"
377,CANTO II,"None else, for none are terrible beside."
378,CANTO II,"I am so fram’d by God, thanks to his grace!"
379,CANTO II,That any suff’rance of your misery
380,CANTO II,"Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire"
381,CANTO II,Assails me. In high heaven a blessed dame
382,CANTO II,"Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief"
383,CANTO II,"That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,"
384,CANTO II,That God’s stern judgment to her will inclines.
385,CANTO II,"To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:"
386,CANTO II,“Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid
387,CANTO II,And I commend him to thee.” At her word
388,CANTO II,"Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,"
389,CANTO II,"And coming to the place, where I abode"
390,CANTO II,"Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,"
391,CANTO II,She thus address’d me: “Thou true praise of God!
392,CANTO II,Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent
393,CANTO II,"To him, who so much lov’d thee, as to leave"
394,CANTO II,For thy sake all the multitude admires?
395,CANTO II,"Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,"
396,CANTO II,"Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,"
397,CANTO II,"Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?”"
398,CANTO II,Ne’er among men did any with such speed
399,CANTO II,"Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,"
400,CANTO II,"As when these words were spoken, I came here,"
401,CANTO II,"Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force"
402,CANTO II,"Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all"
403,CANTO II,"Who well have mark’d it, into honour brings.”"
404,CANTO II,
405,CANTO II,"“When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes"
406,CANTO II,Tearful she turn’d aside; whereat I felt
407,CANTO II,"Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will’d,"
408,CANTO II,"Thus am I come: I sav’d thee from the beast,"
409,CANTO II,Who thy near way across the goodly mount
410,CANTO II,Prevented. What is this comes o’er thee then?
411,CANTO II,"Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast"
412,CANTO II,Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there
413,CANTO II,And noble daring? Since three maids so blest
414,CANTO II,"Thy safety plan, e’en in the court of heaven;"
415,CANTO II,And so much certain good my words forebode.”
416,CANTO II,
417,CANTO II,"As florets, by the frosty air of night"
418,CANTO II,"Bent down and clos’d, when day has blanch’d their leaves,"
419,CANTO II,Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;
420,CANTO II,"So was my fainting vigour new restor’d,"
421,CANTO II,"And to my heart such kindly courage ran,"
422,CANTO II,That I as one undaunted soon replied:
423,CANTO II,"“O full of pity she, who undertook"
424,CANTO II,My succour! and thou kind who didst perform
425,CANTO II,So soon her true behest! With such desire
426,CANTO II,"Thou hast dispos’d me to renew my voyage,"
427,CANTO II,That my first purpose fully is resum’d.
428,CANTO II,Lead on: one only will is in us both.
429,CANTO II,"Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.”"
430,CANTO II,
431,CANTO II,"So spake I; and when he had onward mov’d,"
432,CANTO II,I enter’d on the deep and woody way.
433,CANTO II,
434,CANTO II,
435,CANTO II,
436,CANTO II,
437,CANTO III,CANTO III
438,CANTO III,
439,CANTO III,
440,CANTO III,“Through me you pass into the city of woe:
441,CANTO III,Through me you pass into eternal pain:
442,CANTO III,Through me among the people lost for aye.
443,CANTO III,Justice the founder of my fabric mov’d:
444,CANTO III,"To rear me was the task of power divine,"
445,CANTO III,"Supremest wisdom, and primeval love."
446,CANTO III,"Before me things create were none, save things"
447,CANTO III,"Eternal, and eternal I endure."
448,CANTO III,All hope abandon ye who enter here.”
449,CANTO III,
450,CANTO III,Such characters in colour dim I mark’d
451,CANTO III,Over a portal’s lofty arch inscrib’d:
452,CANTO III,"Whereat I thus: “Master, these words import"
453,CANTO III,Hard meaning.” He as one prepar’d replied:
454,CANTO III,“Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;
455,CANTO III,Here be vile fear extinguish’d. We are come
456,CANTO III,Where I have told thee we shall see the souls
457,CANTO III,"To misery doom’d, who intellectual good"
458,CANTO III,Have lost.” And when his hand he had stretch’d forth
459,CANTO III,"To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer’d,"
460,CANTO III,Into that secret place he led me on.
461,CANTO III,
462,CANTO III,Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans
463,CANTO III,"Resounded through the air pierc’d by no star,"
464,CANTO III,"That e’en I wept at entering. Various tongues,"
465,CANTO III,"Horrible languages, outcries of woe,"
466,CANTO III,"Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,"
467,CANTO III,"With hands together smote that swell’d the sounds,"
468,CANTO III,"Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls"
469,CANTO III,"Round through that air with solid darkness stain’d,"
470,CANTO III,Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.
471,CANTO III,
472,CANTO III,"I then, with error yet encompass’d, cried:"
473,CANTO III,“O master! What is this I hear? What race
474,CANTO III,"Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?”"
475,CANTO III,
476,CANTO III,He thus to me: “This miserable fate
477,CANTO III,"Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv’d"
478,CANTO III,"Without or praise or blame, with that ill band"
479,CANTO III,"Of angels mix’d, who nor rebellious prov’d"
480,CANTO III,"Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves"
481,CANTO III,"Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,"
482,CANTO III,"Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth"
483,CANTO III,"Of Hell receives them, lest th’ accursed tribe"
484,CANTO III,Should glory thence with exultation vain.”
485,CANTO III,
486,CANTO III,"I then: “Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,"
487,CANTO III,That they lament so loud?” He straight replied:
488,CANTO III,“That will I tell thee briefly. These of death
489,CANTO III,No hope may entertain: and their blind life
490,CANTO III,"So meanly passes, that all other lots"
491,CANTO III,"They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,"
492,CANTO III,Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.
493,CANTO III,"Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.”"
494,CANTO III,
495,CANTO III,"And I, who straightway look’d, beheld a flag,"
496,CANTO III,"Which whirling ran around so rapidly,"
497,CANTO III,That it no pause obtain’d: and following came
498,CANTO III,"Such a long train of spirits, I should ne’er"
499,CANTO III,"Have thought, that death so many had despoil’d."
500,CANTO III,
501,CANTO III,"When some of these I recogniz’d, I saw"
502,CANTO III,"And knew the shade of him, who to base fear"
503,CANTO III,"Yielding, abjur’d his high estate. Forthwith"
504,CANTO III,I understood for certain this the tribe
505,CANTO III,Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing
506,CANTO III,"And to his foes. These wretches, who ne’er lived,"
507,CANTO III,"Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung"
508,CANTO III,"By wasps and hornets, which bedew’d their cheeks"
509,CANTO III,"With blood, that mix’d with tears dropp’d to their feet,"
510,CANTO III,And by disgustful worms was gather’d there.
511,CANTO III,
512,CANTO III,Then looking farther onwards I beheld
513,CANTO III,A throng upon the shore of a great stream:
514,CANTO III,Whereat I thus: “Sir! grant me now to know
515,CANTO III,"Whom here we view, and whence impell’d they seem"
516,CANTO III,"So eager to pass o’er, as I discern"
517,CANTO III,Through the blear light?” He thus to me in few:
518,CANTO III,"“This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive"
519,CANTO III,Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.”
520,CANTO III,
521,CANTO III,"Then with eyes downward cast and fill’d with shame,"
522,CANTO III,"Fearing my words offensive to his ear,"
523,CANTO III,"Till we had reach’d the river, I from speech"
524,CANTO III,Abstain’d. And lo! toward us in a bark
525,CANTO III,"Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,"
526,CANTO III,"Crying, “Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not"
527,CANTO III,Ever to see the sky again. I come
528,CANTO III,"To take you to the other shore across,"
529,CANTO III,"Into eternal darkness, there to dwell"
530,CANTO III,"In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there"
531,CANTO III,"Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave"
532,CANTO III,These who are dead.” But soon as he beheld
533,CANTO III,"I left them not, “By other way,” said he,"
534,CANTO III,"“By other haven shalt thou come to shore,"
535,CANTO III,Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat
536,CANTO III,Must carry.” Then to him thus spake my guide:
537,CANTO III,"“Charon! thyself torment not: so ’tis will’d,"
538,CANTO III,Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.”
539,CANTO III,
540,CANTO III,Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks
541,CANTO III,"Of him the boatman o’er the livid lake,"
542,CANTO III,Around whose eyes glar’d wheeling flames. Meanwhile
543,CANTO III,"Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang’d,"
544,CANTO III,"And gnash’d their teeth, soon as the cruel words"
545,CANTO III,"They heard. God and their parents they blasphem’d,"
546,CANTO III,"The human kind, the place, the time, and seed"
547,CANTO III,That did engender them and give them birth.
548,CANTO III,
549,CANTO III,Then all together sorely wailing drew
550,CANTO III,"To the curs’d strand, that every man must pass"
551,CANTO III,"Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,"
552,CANTO III,"With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,"
553,CANTO III,"Beck’ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar"
554,CANTO III,"Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves,"
555,CANTO III,"One still another following, till the bough"
556,CANTO III,Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;
557,CANTO III,E’en in like manner Adam’s evil brood
558,CANTO III,"Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,"
559,CANTO III,"Each at a beck, as falcon at his call."
560,CANTO III,
561,CANTO III,"Thus go they over through the umber’d wave,"
562,CANTO III,And ever they on the opposing bank
563,CANTO III,"Be landed, on this side another throng"
564,CANTO III,"Still gathers. “Son,” thus spake the courteous guide,"
565,CANTO III,"“Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,"
566,CANTO III,"All here together come from every clime,"
567,CANTO III,And to o’erpass the river are not loth:
568,CANTO III,"For so heaven’s justice goads them on, that fear"
569,CANTO III,Is turn’d into desire. Hence ne’er hath past
570,CANTO III,"Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain,"
571,CANTO III,Now mayst thou know the import of his words.”
572,CANTO III,
573,CANTO III,"This said, the gloomy region trembling shook"
574,CANTO III,"So terribly, that yet with clammy dews"
575,CANTO III,"Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,"
576,CANTO III,"That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,"
577,CANTO III,"Which all my senses conquer’d quite, and I"
578,CANTO III,"Down dropp’d, as one with sudden slumber seiz’d."
579,CANTO III,
580,CANTO III,
581,CANTO III,
582,CANTO III,
583,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
584,CANTO IV,
585,CANTO IV,
586,CANTO IV,Broke the deep slumber in my brain a crash
587,CANTO IV,"Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,"
588,CANTO IV,"As one by main force rous’d. Risen upright,"
589,CANTO IV,"My rested eyes I mov’d around, and search’d"
590,CANTO IV,"With fixed ken to know what place it was,"
591,CANTO IV,Wherein I stood. For certain on the brink
592,CANTO IV,"I found me of the lamentable vale,"
593,CANTO IV,"The dread abyss, that joins a thund’rous sound"
594,CANTO IV,"Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,"
595,CANTO IV,"And thick with clouds o’erspread, mine eye in vain"
596,CANTO IV,"Explor’d its bottom, nor could aught discern."
597,CANTO IV,
598,CANTO IV,“Now let us to the blind world there beneath
599,CANTO IV,Descend;” the bard began all pale of look:
600,CANTO IV,"“I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.”"
601,CANTO IV,
602,CANTO IV,"Then I his alter’d hue perceiving, thus:"
603,CANTO IV,"“How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,"
604,CANTO IV,Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?”
605,CANTO IV,
606,CANTO IV,He then: “The anguish of that race below
607,CANTO IV,"With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear"
608,CANTO IV,Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way
609,CANTO IV,"Urges to haste.” Onward, this said, he mov’d;"
610,CANTO IV,And ent’ring led me with him on the bounds
611,CANTO IV,"Of the first circle, that surrounds th’ abyss."
612,CANTO IV,"Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard"
613,CANTO IV,"Except of sighs, that made th’ eternal air"
614,CANTO IV,"Tremble, not caus’d by tortures, but from grief"
615,CANTO IV,"Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,"
616,CANTO IV,"Of men, women, and infants. Then to me"
617,CANTO IV,The gentle guide: “Inquir’st thou not what spirits
618,CANTO IV,"Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass"
619,CANTO IV,"Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin"
620,CANTO IV,"Were blameless; and if aught they merited,"
621,CANTO IV,"It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,"
622,CANTO IV,The portal to thy faith. If they before
623,CANTO IV,"The Gospel liv’d, they serv’d not God aright;"
624,CANTO IV,"And among such am I. For these defects,"
625,CANTO IV,"And for no other evil, we are lost;"
626,CANTO IV,"Only so far afflicted, that we live"
627,CANTO IV,Desiring without hope.” So grief assail’d
628,CANTO IV,"My heart at hearing this, for well I knew"
629,CANTO IV,Suspended in that Limbo many a soul
630,CANTO IV,"Of mighty worth. “O tell me, sire rever’d!"
631,CANTO IV,"Tell me, my master!” I began through wish"
632,CANTO IV,"Of full assurance in that holy faith,"
633,CANTO IV,"Which vanquishes all error; “say, did e’er"
634,CANTO IV,"Any, or through his own or other’s merit,"
635,CANTO IV,"Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?”"
636,CANTO IV,
637,CANTO IV,"Piercing the secret purport of my speech,"
638,CANTO IV,"He answer’d: “I was new to that estate,"
639,CANTO IV,When I beheld a puissant one arrive
640,CANTO IV,"Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown’d."
641,CANTO IV,"He forth the shade of our first parent drew,"
642,CANTO IV,"Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,"
643,CANTO IV,"Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv’d,"
644,CANTO IV,"Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,"
645,CANTO IV,"Israel with his sire and with his sons,"
646,CANTO IV,"Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,"
647,CANTO IV,"And others many more, whom he to bliss"
648,CANTO IV,"Exalted. Before these, be thou assur’d,"
649,CANTO IV,No spirit of human kind was ever sav’d.”
650,CANTO IV,
651,CANTO IV,"We, while he spake, ceas’d not our onward road,"
652,CANTO IV,Still passing through the wood; for so I name
653,CANTO IV,Those spirits thick beset. We were not far
654,CANTO IV,"On this side from the summit, when I kenn’d"
655,CANTO IV,"A flame, that o’er the darken’d hemisphere"
656,CANTO IV,Prevailing shin’d. Yet we a little space
657,CANTO IV,"Were distant, not so far but I in part"
658,CANTO IV,"Discover’d, that a tribe in honour high"
659,CANTO IV,"That place possess’d. “O thou, who every art"
660,CANTO IV,"And science valu’st! who are these, that boast"
661,CANTO IV,"Such honour, separate from all the rest?”"
662,CANTO IV,
663,CANTO IV,He answer’d: “The renown of their great names
664,CANTO IV,"That echoes through your world above, acquires"
665,CANTO IV,"Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc’d.”"
666,CANTO IV,Meantime a voice I heard: “Honour the bard
667,CANTO IV,Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!”
668,CANTO IV,"No sooner ceas’d the sound, than I beheld"
669,CANTO IV,"Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,"
670,CANTO IV,Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.
671,CANTO IV,
672,CANTO IV,"When thus my master kind began: “Mark him,"
673,CANTO IV,"Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,"
674,CANTO IV,"The other three preceding, as their lord."
675,CANTO IV,"This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:"
676,CANTO IV,Flaccus the next in satire’s vein excelling;
677,CANTO IV,The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.
678,CANTO IV,"Because they all that appellation own,"
679,CANTO IV,"With which the voice singly accosted me,"
680,CANTO IV,"Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.”"
681,CANTO IV,
682,CANTO IV,So I beheld united the bright school
683,CANTO IV,"Of him the monarch of sublimest song,"
684,CANTO IV,That o’er the others like an eagle soars.
685,CANTO IV,"When they together short discourse had held,"
686,CANTO IV,"They turn’d to me, with salutation kind"
687,CANTO IV,Beck’ning me; at the which my master smil’d:
688,CANTO IV,Nor was this all; but greater honour still
689,CANTO IV,"They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;"
690,CANTO IV,And I was sixth amid so learn’d a band.
691,CANTO IV,
692,CANTO IV,Far as the luminous beacon on we pass’d
693,CANTO IV,"Speaking of matters, then befitting well"
694,CANTO IV,"To speak, now fitter left untold. At foot"
695,CANTO IV,"Of a magnificent castle we arriv’d,"
696,CANTO IV,"Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round"
697,CANTO IV,Defended by a pleasant stream. O’er this
698,CANTO IV,As o’er dry land we pass’d. Next through seven gates
699,CANTO IV,"I with those sages enter’d, and we came"
700,CANTO IV,Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.
701,CANTO IV,
702,CANTO IV,"There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around"
703,CANTO IV,"Majestically mov’d, and in their port"
704,CANTO IV,Bore eminent authority; they spake
705,CANTO IV,"Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet."
706,CANTO IV,
707,CANTO IV,"We to one side retir’d, into a place"
708,CANTO IV,"Open and bright and lofty, whence each one"
709,CANTO IV,Stood manifest to view. Incontinent
710,CANTO IV,There on the green enamel of the plain
711,CANTO IV,"Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight"
712,CANTO IV,I am exalted in my own esteem.
713,CANTO IV,
714,CANTO IV,Electra there I saw accompanied
715,CANTO IV,"By many, among whom Hector I knew,"
716,CANTO IV,"Anchises’ pious son, and with hawk’s eye"
717,CANTO IV,"Caesar all arm’d, and by Camilla there"
718,CANTO IV,Penthesilea. On the other side
719,CANTO IV,"Old King Latinus, seated by his child"
720,CANTO IV,"Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,"
721,CANTO IV,"Who Tarquin chas’d, Lucretia, Cato’s wife"
722,CANTO IV,"Marcia, with Julia and Cornelia there;"
723,CANTO IV,"And sole apart retir’d, the Soldan fierce."
724,CANTO IV,
725,CANTO IV,"Then when a little more I rais’d my brow,"
726,CANTO IV,"I spied the master of the sapient throng,"
727,CANTO IV,Seated amid the philosophic train.
728,CANTO IV,"Him all admire, all pay him rev’rence due."
729,CANTO IV,"There Socrates and Plato both I mark’d,"
730,CANTO IV,"Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,"
731,CANTO IV,"Who sets the world at chance, Diogenes,"
732,CANTO IV,"With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,"
733,CANTO IV,"And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,"
734,CANTO IV,"Zeno, and Dioscorides well read"
735,CANTO IV,In nature’s secret lore. Orpheus I mark’d
736,CANTO IV,"And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,"
737,CANTO IV,"Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,"
738,CANTO IV,"Galenus, Avicen, and him who made"
739,CANTO IV,"That commentary vast, Averroes."
740,CANTO IV,
741,CANTO IV,Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;
742,CANTO IV,"For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes"
743,CANTO IV,My words fall short of what bechanc’d. In two
744,CANTO IV,The six associates part. Another way
745,CANTO IV,"My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,"
746,CANTO IV,Into a climate ever vex’d with storms:
747,CANTO IV,And to a part I come where no light shines.
748,CANTO IV,
749,CANTO IV,
750,CANTO IV,
751,CANTO IV,
752,CANTO V,CANTO V
753,CANTO V,
754,CANTO V,
755,CANTO V,From the first circle I descended thus
756,CANTO V,"Down to the second, which, a lesser space"
757,CANTO V,"Embracing, so much more of grief contains"
758,CANTO V,"Provoking bitter moans. There, Minos stands"
759,CANTO V,"Grinning with ghastly feature: he, of all"
760,CANTO V,"Who enter, strict examining the crimes,"
761,CANTO V,"Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,"
762,CANTO V,According as he foldeth him around:
763,CANTO V,"For when before him comes th’ ill fated soul,"
764,CANTO V,It all confesses; and that judge severe
765,CANTO V,"Of sins, considering what place in hell"
766,CANTO V,"Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft"
767,CANTO V,"Himself encircles, as degrees beneath"
768,CANTO V,He dooms it to descend. Before him stand
769,CANTO V,Always a num’rous throng; and in his turn
770,CANTO V,"Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears"
771,CANTO V,"His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl’d."
772,CANTO V,
773,CANTO V,“O thou! who to this residence of woe
774,CANTO V,"Approachest?” when he saw me coming, cried"
775,CANTO V,"Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,"
776,CANTO V,“Look how thou enter here; beware in whom
777,CANTO V,Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad
778,CANTO V,Deceive thee to thy harm.” To him my guide:
779,CANTO V,“Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way
780,CANTO V,By destiny appointed; so ’tis will’d
781,CANTO V,Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more.”
782,CANTO V,
783,CANTO V,Now ’gin the rueful wailings to be heard.
784,CANTO V,Now am I come where many a plaining voice
785,CANTO V,Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came
786,CANTO V,Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan’d
787,CANTO V,A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
788,CANTO V,By warring winds. The stormy blast of hell
789,CANTO V,With restless fury drives the spirits on
790,CANTO V,Whirl’d round and dash’d amain with sore annoy.
791,CANTO V,"When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,"
792,CANTO V,"There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,"
793,CANTO V,And blasphemies ’gainst the good Power in heaven.
794,CANTO V,
795,CANTO V,I understood that to this torment sad
796,CANTO V,"The carnal sinners are condemn’d, in whom"
797,CANTO V,Reason by lust is sway’d. As in large troops
798,CANTO V,"And multitudinous, when winter reigns,"
799,CANTO V,The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;
800,CANTO V,So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.
801,CANTO V,"On this side and on that, above, below,"
802,CANTO V,It drives them: hope of rest to solace them
803,CANTO V,"Is none, nor e’en of milder pang. As cranes,"
804,CANTO V,"Chanting their dol’rous notes, traverse the sky,"
805,CANTO V,Stretch’d out in long array: so I beheld
806,CANTO V,"Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on"
807,CANTO V,By their dire doom. Then I: “Instructor! who
808,CANTO V,"Are these, by the black air so scourg’d?”—” The first"
809,CANTO V,"’Mong those, of whom thou question’st,” he replied,"
810,CANTO V,“O’er many tongues was empress. She in vice
811,CANTO V,"Of luxury was so shameless, that she made"
812,CANTO V,"Liking be lawful by promulg’d decree,"
813,CANTO V,To clear the blame she had herself incurr’d.
814,CANTO V,"This is Semiramis, of whom ’tis writ,"
815,CANTO V,That she succeeded Ninus her espous’d;
816,CANTO V,"And held the land, which now the Soldan rules."
817,CANTO V,"The next in amorous fury slew herself,"
818,CANTO V,And to Sicheus’ ashes broke her faith:
819,CANTO V,"Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.”"
820,CANTO V,
821,CANTO V,"There mark’d I Helen, for whose sake so long"
822,CANTO V,The time was fraught with evil; there the great
823,CANTO V,"Achilles, who with love fought to the end."
824,CANTO V,"Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside"
825,CANTO V,"A thousand more he show’d me, and by name"
826,CANTO V,"Pointed them out, whom love bereav’d of life."
827,CANTO V,
828,CANTO V,When I had heard my sage instructor name
829,CANTO V,"Those dames and knights of antique days, o’erpower’d"
830,CANTO V,"By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind"
831,CANTO V,Was lost; and I began: “Bard! willingly
832,CANTO V,"I would address those two together coming,"
833,CANTO V,Which seem so light before the wind.” He thus:
834,CANTO V,"“Note thou, when nearer they to us approach."
835,CANTO V,"Then by that love which carries them along,"
836,CANTO V,Entreat; and they will come.” Soon as the wind
837,CANTO V,"Sway’d them toward us, I thus fram’d my speech:"
838,CANTO V,"“O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse"
839,CANTO V,"With us, if by none else restrain’d.” As doves"
840,CANTO V,"By fond desire invited, on wide wings"
841,CANTO V,"And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,"
842,CANTO V,"Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;"
843,CANTO V,"Thus issu’d from that troop, where Dido ranks,"
844,CANTO V,They through the ill air speeding; with such force
845,CANTO V,My cry prevail’d by strong affection urg’d.
846,CANTO V,
847,CANTO V,“O gracious creature and benign! who go’st
848,CANTO V,"Visiting, through this element obscure,"
849,CANTO V,"Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru’d;"
850,CANTO V,"If for a friend the King of all we own’d,"
851,CANTO V,"Our pray’r to him should for thy peace arise,"
852,CANTO V,Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.
853,CANTO V,()f whatsoe’er to hear or to discourse
854,CANTO V,"It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that"
855,CANTO V,"Freely with thee discourse, while e’er the wind,"
856,CANTO V,"As now, is mute. The land, that gave me birth,"
857,CANTO V,"Is situate on the coast, where Po descends"
858,CANTO V,To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.
859,CANTO V,
860,CANTO V,"“Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt,"
861,CANTO V,"Entangled him by that fair form, from me"
862,CANTO V,"Ta’en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:"
863,CANTO V,"Love, that denial takes from none belov’d,"
864,CANTO V,"Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,"
865,CANTO V,"That, as thou see’st, he yet deserts me not."
866,CANTO V,Love brought us to one death: Caina waits
867,CANTO V,"The soul, who spilt our life.” Such were their words;"
868,CANTO V,"At hearing which downward I bent my looks,"
869,CANTO V,"And held them there so long, that the bard cried:"
870,CANTO V,“What art thou pond’ring?” I in answer thus:
871,CANTO V,"“Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire"
872,CANTO V,Must they at length to that ill pass have reach’d!”
873,CANTO V,
874,CANTO V,"Then turning, I to them my speech address’d."
875,CANTO V,And thus began: “Francesca! your sad fate
876,CANTO V,Even to tears my grief and pity moves.
877,CANTO V,"But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,"
878,CANTO V,"By what, and how love granted, that ye knew"
879,CANTO V,Your yet uncertain wishes?” She replied:
880,CANTO V,“No greater grief than to remember days
881,CANTO V,"Of joy, when mis’ry is at hand! That kens"
882,CANTO V,Thy learn’d instructor. Yet so eagerly
883,CANTO V,"If thou art bent to know the primal root,"
884,CANTO V,"From whence our love gat being, I will do,"
885,CANTO V,"As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day"
886,CANTO V,"For our delight we read of Lancelot,"
887,CANTO V,"How him love thrall’d. Alone we were, and no"
888,CANTO V,Suspicion near us. Ofttimes by that reading
889,CANTO V,"Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue"
890,CANTO V,Fled from our alter’d cheek. But at one point
891,CANTO V,"Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,"
892,CANTO V,"The wished smile, rapturously kiss’d"
893,CANTO V,"By one so deep in love, then he, who ne’er"
894,CANTO V,"From me shall separate, at once my lips"
895,CANTO V,All trembling kiss’d. The book and writer both
896,CANTO V,Were love’s purveyors. In its leaves that day
897,CANTO V,"We read no more.” While thus one spirit spake,"
898,CANTO V,"The other wail’d so sorely, that heartstruck"
899,CANTO V,"I through compassion fainting, seem’d not far"
900,CANTO V,"From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground."
901,CANTO V,
902,CANTO V,
903,CANTO V,
904,CANTO V,
905,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
906,CANTO VI,
907,CANTO VI,
908,CANTO VI,"My sense reviving, that erewhile had droop’d"
909,CANTO VI,"With pity for the kindred shades, whence grief"
910,CANTO VI,"O’ercame me wholly, straight around I see"
911,CANTO VI,"New torments, new tormented souls, which way"
912,CANTO VI,"Soe’er I move, or turn, or bend my sight."
913,CANTO VI,"In the third circle I arrive, of show’rs"
914,CANTO VI,"Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang’d"
915,CANTO VI,"For ever, both in kind and in degree."
916,CANTO VI,"Large hail, discolour’d water, sleety flaw"
917,CANTO VI,Through the dun midnight air stream’d down amain:
918,CANTO VI,Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.
919,CANTO VI,
920,CANTO VI,"Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,"
921,CANTO VI,Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
922,CANTO VI,Over the multitude immers’d beneath.
923,CANTO VI,"His eyes glare crimson, black his unctuous beard,"
924,CANTO VI,"His belly large, and claw’d the hands, with which"
925,CANTO VI,"He tears the spirits, flays them, and their limbs"
926,CANTO VI,"Piecemeal disparts. Howling there spread, as curs,"
927,CANTO VI,"Under the rainy deluge, with one side"
928,CANTO VI,"The other screening, oft they roll them round,"
929,CANTO VI,"A wretched, godless crew. When that great worm"
930,CANTO VI,"Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op’d"
931,CANTO VI,"His jaws, and the fangs show’d us; not a limb"
932,CANTO VI,"Of him but trembled. Then my guide, his palms"
933,CANTO VI,"Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth"
934,CANTO VI,"Rais’d them, and cast it in his ravenous maw."
935,CANTO VI,"E’en as a dog, that yelling bays for food"
936,CANTO VI,"His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall"
937,CANTO VI,"His fury, bent alone with eager haste"
938,CANTO VI,To swallow it; so dropp’d the loathsome cheeks
939,CANTO VI,"Of demon Cerberus, who thund’ring stuns"
940,CANTO VI,"The spirits, that they for deafness wish in vain."
941,CANTO VI,
942,CANTO VI,"We, o’er the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt"
943,CANTO VI,"Of the heavy tempest passing, set our feet"
944,CANTO VI,"Upon their emptiness, that substance seem’d."
945,CANTO VI,
946,CANTO VI,They all along the earth extended lay
947,CANTO VI,"Save one, that sudden rais’d himself to sit,"
948,CANTO VI,Soon as that way he saw us pass. “O thou!”
949,CANTO VI,"He cried, “who through the infernal shades art led,"
950,CANTO VI,"Own, if again thou know’st me. Thou wast fram’d"
951,CANTO VI,Or ere my frame was broken.” I replied:
952,CANTO VI,“The anguish thou endur’st perchance so takes
953,CANTO VI,"Thy form from my remembrance, that it seems"
954,CANTO VI,As if I saw thee never. But inform
955,CANTO VI,"Me who thou art, that in a place so sad"
956,CANTO VI,"Art set, and in such torment, that although"
957,CANTO VI,"Other be greater, more disgustful none"
958,CANTO VI,Can be imagin’d.” He in answer thus:
959,CANTO VI,"“Thy city heap’d with envy to the brim,"
960,CANTO VI,"Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,"
961,CANTO VI,Held me in brighter days. Ye citizens
962,CANTO VI,Were wont to name me Ciacco. For the sin
963,CANTO VI,"Of glutt’ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,"
964,CANTO VI,"E’en as thou see’st, I with fatigue am worn;"
965,CANTO VI,Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these
966,CANTO VI,Have by like crime incurr’d like punishment.”
967,CANTO VI,
968,CANTO VI,"No more he said, and I my speech resum’d:"
969,CANTO VI,"“Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,"
970,CANTO VI,"Even to tears. But tell me, if thou know’st,"
971,CANTO VI,What shall at length befall the citizens
972,CANTO VI,Of the divided city; whether any just one
973,CANTO VI,"Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,"
974,CANTO VI,Whence jarring discord hath assail’d it thus?”
975,CANTO VI,
976,CANTO VI,He then: “After long striving they will come
977,CANTO VI,To blood; and the wild party from the woods
978,CANTO VI,Will chase the other with much injury forth.
979,CANTO VI,"Then it behoves, that this must fall, within"
980,CANTO VI,Three solar circles; and the other rise
981,CANTO VI,"By borrow’d force of one, who under shore"
982,CANTO VI,Now rests. It shall a long space hold aloof
983,CANTO VI,"Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight"
984,CANTO VI,"The other oppress’d, indignant at the load,"
985,CANTO VI,"And grieving sore. The just are two in number,"
986,CANTO VI,"But they neglected. Av’rice, envy, pride,"
987,CANTO VI,"Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all"
988,CANTO VI,On fire.” Here ceas’d the lamentable sound;
989,CANTO VI,And I continu’d thus: “Still would I learn
990,CANTO VI,"More from thee, farther parley still entreat."
991,CANTO VI,"Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,"
992,CANTO VI,"They who so well deserv’d, of Giacopo,"
993,CANTO VI,"Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent"
994,CANTO VI,Their minds on working good. Oh! tell me where
995,CANTO VI,"They bide, and to their knowledge let me come."
996,CANTO VI,"For I am press’d with keen desire to hear,"
997,CANTO VI,If heaven’s sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
998,CANTO VI,Be to their lip assign’d.” He answer’d straight:
999,CANTO VI,“These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes
1000,CANTO VI,Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.
1001,CANTO VI,"If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them."
1002,CANTO VI,"But to the pleasant world when thou return’st,"
1003,CANTO VI,"Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there."
1004,CANTO VI,"No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.”"
1005,CANTO VI,
1006,CANTO VI,"This said, his fixed eyes he turn’d askance,"
1007,CANTO VI,"A little ey’d me, then bent down his head,"
1008,CANTO VI,And ’midst his blind companions with it fell.
1009,CANTO VI,
1010,CANTO VI,"When thus my guide: “No more his bed he leaves,"
1011,CANTO VI,Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. The Power
1012,CANTO VI,"Adverse to these shall then in glory come,"
1013,CANTO VI,"Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,"
1014,CANTO VI,"Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,"
1015,CANTO VI,And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend
1016,CANTO VI,The vault.” So pass’d we through that mixture foul
1017,CANTO VI,"Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile"
1018,CANTO VI,"Touching, though slightly, on the life to come."
1019,CANTO VI,"For thus I question’d: “Shall these tortures, Sir!"
1020,CANTO VI,"When the great sentence passes, be increas’d,"
1021,CANTO VI,"Or mitigated, or as now severe?”"
1022,CANTO VI,
1023,CANTO VI,He then: “Consult thy knowledge; that decides
1024,CANTO VI,"That as each thing to more perfection grows,"
1025,CANTO VI,It feels more sensibly both good and pain.
1026,CANTO VI,Though ne’er to true perfection may arrive
1027,CANTO VI,"This race accurs’d, yet nearer then than now"
1028,CANTO VI,They shall approach it.” Compassing that path
1029,CANTO VI,"Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse"
1030,CANTO VI,Much more than I relate between us pass’d:
1031,CANTO VI,"Till at the point, where the steps led below,"
1032,CANTO VI,"Arriv’d, there Plutus, the great foe, we found."
1033,CANTO VI,
1034,CANTO VI,
1035,CANTO VI,
1036,CANTO VI,
1037,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
1038,CANTO VII,
1039,CANTO VII,
1040,CANTO VII,“Ah me! O Satan! Satan!” loud exclaim’d
1041,CANTO VII,"Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:"
1042,CANTO VII,"And the kind sage, whom no event surpris’d,"
1043,CANTO VII,To comfort me thus spake: “Let not thy fear
1044,CANTO VII,"Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none"
1045,CANTO VII,To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.”
1046,CANTO VII,"Then to that sworn lip turning, “ Peace!” he cried,"
1047,CANTO VII,“Curs’d wolf! thy fury inward on thyself
1048,CANTO VII,"Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound"
1049,CANTO VII,Not without cause he passes. So ’tis will’d
1050,CANTO VII,"On high, there where the great Archangel pour’d"
1051,CANTO VII,Heav’n’s vengeance on the first adulterer proud.”
1052,CANTO VII,
1053,CANTO VII,As sails full spread and bellying with the wind
1054,CANTO VII,"Drop suddenly collaps’d, if the mast split;"
1055,CANTO VII,So to the ground down dropp’d the cruel fiend.
1056,CANTO VII,
1057,CANTO VII,"Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,"
1058,CANTO VII,"Gain’d on the dismal shore, that all the woe"
1059,CANTO VII,Hems in of all the universe. Ah me!
1060,CANTO VII,Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap’st
1061,CANTO VII,"New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!"
1062,CANTO VII,Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?
1063,CANTO VII,
1064,CANTO VII,"E’en as a billow, on Charybdis rising,"
1065,CANTO VII,Against encounter’d billow dashing breaks;
1066,CANTO VII,"Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,"
1067,CANTO VII,"Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,"
1068,CANTO VII,"From one side and the other, with loud voice,"
1069,CANTO VII,"Both roll’d on weights by main forge of their breasts,"
1070,CANTO VII,"Then smote together, and each one forthwith"
1071,CANTO VII,"Roll’d them back voluble, turning again,"
1072,CANTO VII,"Exclaiming these, “Why holdest thou so fast?”"
1073,CANTO VII,"Those answering, “And why castest thou away?”"
1074,CANTO VII,"So still repeating their despiteful song,"
1075,CANTO VII,They to the opposite point on either hand
1076,CANTO VII,"Travers’d the horrid circle: then arriv’d,"
1077,CANTO VII,"Both turn’d them round, and through the middle space"
1078,CANTO VII,Conflicting met again. At sight whereof
1079,CANTO VII,"I, stung with grief, thus spake: “O say, my guide!"
1080,CANTO VII,"What race is this? Were these, whose heads are shorn,"
1081,CANTO VII,"On our left hand, all sep’rate to the church?”"
1082,CANTO VII,
1083,CANTO VII,He straight replied: “In their first life these all
1084,CANTO VII,"In mind were so distorted, that they made,"
1085,CANTO VII,"According to due measure, of their wealth,"
1086,CANTO VII,"No use. This clearly from their words collect,"
1087,CANTO VII,"Which they howl forth, at each extremity"
1088,CANTO VII,"Arriving of the circle, where their crime"
1089,CANTO VII,Contrary’ in kind disparts them. To the church
1090,CANTO VII,"Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls"
1091,CANTO VII,"Are crown’d, both Popes and Cardinals, o’er whom"
1092,CANTO VII,Av’rice dominion absolute maintains.”
1093,CANTO VII,
1094,CANTO VII,"I then: “Mid such as these some needs must be,"
1095,CANTO VII,"Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot"
1096,CANTO VII,Of these foul sins were stain’d.” He answering thus:
1097,CANTO VII,"“Vain thought conceiv’st thou. That ignoble life,"
1098,CANTO VII,"Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,"
1099,CANTO VII,And to all knowledge indiscernible.
1100,CANTO VII,Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:
1101,CANTO VII,"These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,"
1102,CANTO VII,"Those with close-shaven locks. That ill they gave,"
1103,CANTO VII,"And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world"
1104,CANTO VII,"Depriv’d, and set them at this strife, which needs"
1105,CANTO VII,No labour’d phrase of mine to set if off.
1106,CANTO VII,"Now may’st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,"
1107,CANTO VII,"The goods committed into fortune’s hands,"
1108,CANTO VII,For which the human race keep such a coil!
1109,CANTO VII,"Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,"
1110,CANTO VII,"Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls"
1111,CANTO VII,Might purchase rest for one.” I thus rejoin’d:
1112,CANTO VII,
1113,CANTO VII,“My guide! of thee this also would I learn;
1114,CANTO VII,"This fortune, that thou speak’st of, what it is,"
1115,CANTO VII,Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?”
1116,CANTO VII,
1117,CANTO VII,He thus: “O beings blind! what ignorance
1118,CANTO VII,Besets you? Now my judgment hear and mark.
1119,CANTO VII,"He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,"
1120,CANTO VII,"The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers"
1121,CANTO VII,"To guide them, so that each part shines to each,"
1122,CANTO VII,Their light in equal distribution pour’d.
1123,CANTO VII,By similar appointment he ordain’d
1124,CANTO VII,Over the world’s bright images to rule.
1125,CANTO VII,Superintendence of a guiding hand
1126,CANTO VII,"And general minister, which at due time"
1127,CANTO VII,May change the empty vantages of life
1128,CANTO VII,"From race to race, from one to other’s blood,"
1129,CANTO VII,Beyond prevention of man’s wisest care:
1130,CANTO VII,"Wherefore one nation rises into sway,"
1131,CANTO VII,"Another languishes, e’en as her will"
1132,CANTO VII,"Decrees, from us conceal’d, as in the grass"
1133,CANTO VII,The serpent train. Against her nought avails
1134,CANTO VII,"Your utmost wisdom. She with foresight plans,"
1135,CANTO VII,"Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs"
1136,CANTO VII,The other powers divine. Her changes know
1137,CANTO VII,Nore intermission: by necessity
1138,CANTO VII,"She is made swift, so frequent come who claim"
1139,CANTO VII,"Succession in her favours. This is she,"
1140,CANTO VII,"So execrated e’en by those, whose debt"
1141,CANTO VII,To her is rather praise; they wrongfully
1142,CANTO VII,"With blame requite her, and with evil word;"
1143,CANTO VII,"But she is blessed, and for that recks not:"
1144,CANTO VII,Amidst the other primal beings glad
1145,CANTO VII,"Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults."
1146,CANTO VII,"Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe"
1147,CANTO VII,"Descending: for each star is falling now,"
1148,CANTO VII,"That mounted at our entrance, and forbids"
1149,CANTO VII,Too long our tarrying.” We the circle cross’d
1150,CANTO VII,"To the next steep, arriving at a well,"
1151,CANTO VII,That boiling pours itself down to a foss
1152,CANTO VII,Sluic’d from its source. Far murkier was the wave
1153,CANTO VII,Than sablest grain: and we in company
1154,CANTO VII,"Of the’ inky waters, journeying by their side,"
1155,CANTO VII,"Enter’d, though by a different track, beneath."
1156,CANTO VII,"Into a lake, the Stygian nam’d, expands"
1157,CANTO VII,"The dismal stream, when it hath reach’d the foot"
1158,CANTO VII,Of the grey wither’d cliffs. Intent I stood
1159,CANTO VII,"To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried"
1160,CANTO VII,"A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks"
1161,CANTO VII,Betok’ning rage. They with their hands alone
1162,CANTO VII,"Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,"
1163,CANTO VII,Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.
1164,CANTO VII,
1165,CANTO VII,"The good instructor spake; “Now seest thou, son!"
1166,CANTO VII,"The souls of those, whom anger overcame."
1167,CANTO VII,"This too for certain know, that underneath"
1168,CANTO VII,"The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs"
1169,CANTO VII,"Into these bubbles make the surface heave,"
1170,CANTO VII,As thine eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turn.
1171,CANTO VII,Fix’d in the slime they say: “Sad once were we
1172,CANTO VII,"In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,"
1173,CANTO VII,Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:
1174,CANTO VII,Now in these murky settlings are we sad.”
1175,CANTO VII,Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.
1176,CANTO VII,But word distinct can utter none.” Our route
1177,CANTO VII,"Thus compass’d we, a segment widely stretch’d"
1178,CANTO VII,"Between the dry embankment, and the core"
1179,CANTO VII,"Of the loath’d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes"
1180,CANTO VII,Downward on those who gulp’d its muddy lees;
1181,CANTO VII,"Nor stopp’d, till to a tower’s low base we came."
1182,CANTO VII,
1183,CANTO VII,
1184,CANTO VII,
1185,CANTO VII,
1186,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
1187,CANTO VIII,
1188,CANTO VIII,
1189,CANTO VIII,"My theme pursuing, I relate that ere"
1190,CANTO VIII,"We reach’d the lofty turret’s base, our eyes"
1191,CANTO VIII,"Its height ascended, where two cressets hung"
1192,CANTO VIII,"We mark’d, and from afar another light"
1193,CANTO VIII,"Return the signal, so remote, that scarce"
1194,CANTO VIII,The eye could catch its beam. I turning round
1195,CANTO VIII,"To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir’d:"
1196,CANTO VIII,“Say what this means? and what that other light
1197,CANTO VIII,In answer set? what agency doth this?”
1198,CANTO VIII,
1199,CANTO VIII,"“There on the filthy waters,” he replied,"
1200,CANTO VIII,"“E’en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,"
1201,CANTO VIII,If the marsh-gender’d fog conceal it not.”
1202,CANTO VIII,
1203,CANTO VIII,"Never was arrow from the cord dismiss’d,"
1204,CANTO VIII,"That ran its way so nimbly through the air,"
1205,CANTO VIII,"As a small bark, that through the waves I spied"
1206,CANTO VIII,"Toward us coming, under the sole sway"
1207,CANTO VIII,"Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:"
1208,CANTO VIII,"“Art thou arriv’d, fell spirit?”—“Phlegyas, Phlegyas,"
1209,CANTO VIII,"This time thou criest in vain,” my lord replied;"
1210,CANTO VIII,"“No longer shalt thou have us, but while o’er"
1211,CANTO VIII,The slimy pool we pass.” As one who hears
1212,CANTO VIII,"Of some great wrong he hath sustain’d, whereat"
1213,CANTO VIII,Inly he pines; so Phlegyas inly pin’d
1214,CANTO VIII,In his fierce ire. My guide descending stepp’d
1215,CANTO VIII,"Into the skiff, and bade me enter next"
1216,CANTO VIII,Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem’d
1217,CANTO VIII,"The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark’d,"
1218,CANTO VIII,"Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,"
1219,CANTO VIII,More deeply than with others it is wont.
1220,CANTO VIII,
1221,CANTO VIII,While we our course o’er the dead channel held.
1222,CANTO VIII,"One drench’d in mire before me came, and said;"
1223,CANTO VIII,"“Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?”"
1224,CANTO VIII,
1225,CANTO VIII,"I answer’d: “Though I come, I tarry not;"
1226,CANTO VIII,"But who art thou, that art become so foul?”"
1227,CANTO VIII,
1228,CANTO VIII,"“One, as thou seest, who mourn: “ he straight replied."
1229,CANTO VIII,
1230,CANTO VIII,"To which I thus: “ In mourning and in woe,"
1231,CANTO VIII,"Curs’d spirit! tarry thou. I know thee well,"
1232,CANTO VIII,E’en thus in filth disguis’d.” Then stretch’d he forth
1233,CANTO VIII,Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage
1234,CANTO VIII,"Aware, thrusting him back: “Away! down there"
1235,CANTO VIII,"To the’ other dogs!” then, with his arms my neck"
1236,CANTO VIII,"Encircling, kiss’d my cheek, and spake: “O soul"
1237,CANTO VIII,Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom
1238,CANTO VIII,Thou was conceiv’d! He in the world was one
1239,CANTO VIII,For arrogance noted; to his memory
1240,CANTO VIII,No virtue lends its lustre; even so
1241,CANTO VIII,Here is his shadow furious. There above
1242,CANTO VIII,How many now hold themselves mighty kings
1243,CANTO VIII,"Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,"
1244,CANTO VIII,Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!”
1245,CANTO VIII,
1246,CANTO VIII,I then: “Master! him fain would I behold
1247,CANTO VIII,"Whelm’d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.”"
1248,CANTO VIII,
1249,CANTO VIII,He thus: “Or ever to thy view the shore
1250,CANTO VIII,"Be offer’d, satisfied shall be that wish,"
1251,CANTO VIII,Which well deserves completion.” Scarce his words
1252,CANTO VIII,"Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes"
1253,CANTO VIII,"Set on him with such violence, that yet"
1254,CANTO VIII,For that render I thanks to God and praise
1255,CANTO VIII,“To Filippo Argenti:” cried they all:
1256,CANTO VIII,And on himself the moody Florentine
1257,CANTO VIII,"Turn’d his avenging fangs. Him here we left,"
1258,CANTO VIII,Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear
1259,CANTO VIII,"Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,"
1260,CANTO VIII,Whereat mine eye unbarr’d I sent abroad.
1261,CANTO VIII,
1262,CANTO VIII,"And thus the good instructor: “Now, my son!"
1263,CANTO VIII,"Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam’d,"
1264,CANTO VIII,"With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.”"
1265,CANTO VIII,
1266,CANTO VIII,"I thus: “The minarets already, Sir!"
1267,CANTO VIII,"There certes in the valley I descry,"
1268,CANTO VIII,"Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire"
1269,CANTO VIII,"Had issu’d.” He replied: “Eternal fire,"
1270,CANTO VIII,"That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame"
1271,CANTO VIII,Illum’d; as in this nether hell thou seest.”
1272,CANTO VIII,
1273,CANTO VIII,"We came within the fosses deep, that moat"
1274,CANTO VIII,This region comfortless. The walls appear’d
1275,CANTO VIII,As they were fram’d of iron. We had made
1276,CANTO VIII,"Wide circuit, ere a place we reach’d, where loud"
1277,CANTO VIII,The mariner cried vehement: “Go forth!
1278,CANTO VIII,The’ entrance is here!” Upon the gates I spied
1279,CANTO VIII,"More than a thousand, who of old from heaven"
1280,CANTO VIII,"Were hurl’d. With ireful gestures, “Who is this,”"
1281,CANTO VIII,"They cried, “that without death first felt, goes through"
1282,CANTO VIII,The regions of the dead?” My sapient guide
1283,CANTO VIII,Made sign that he for secret parley wish’d;
1284,CANTO VIII,"Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus"
1285,CANTO VIII,They spake: “Come thou alone; and let him go
1286,CANTO VIII,Who hath so hardily enter’d this realm.
1287,CANTO VIII,Alone return he by his witless way;
1288,CANTO VIII,"If well he know it, let him prove. For thee,"
1289,CANTO VIII,"Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark"
1290,CANTO VIII,"Hast been his escort.” Now bethink thee, reader!"
1291,CANTO VIII,What cheer was mine at sound of those curs’d words.
1292,CANTO VIII,I did believe I never should return.
1293,CANTO VIII,
1294,CANTO VIII,“O my lov’d guide! who more than seven times
1295,CANTO VIII,"Security hast render’d me, and drawn"
1296,CANTO VIII,"From peril deep, whereto I stood expos’d,"
1297,CANTO VIII,"Desert me not,” I cried, “in this extreme."
1298,CANTO VIII,"And if our onward going be denied,"
1299,CANTO VIII,Together trace we back our steps with speed.”
1300,CANTO VIII,
1301,CANTO VIII,"My liege, who thither had conducted me,"
1302,CANTO VIII,Replied: “Fear not: for of our passage none
1303,CANTO VIII,"Hath power to disappoint us, by such high"
1304,CANTO VIII,Authority permitted. But do thou
1305,CANTO VIII,Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit
1306,CANTO VIII,"Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur’d"
1307,CANTO VIII,I will not leave thee in this lower world.”
1308,CANTO VIII,
1309,CANTO VIII,"This said, departs the sire benevolent,"
1310,CANTO VIII,And quits me. Hesitating I remain
1311,CANTO VIII,At war ’twixt will and will not in my thoughts.
1312,CANTO VIII,
1313,CANTO VIII,"I could not hear what terms he offer’d them,"
1314,CANTO VIII,"But they conferr’d not long, for all at once"
1315,CANTO VIII,To trial fled within. Clos’d were the gates
1316,CANTO VIII,By those our adversaries on the breast
1317,CANTO VIII,Of my liege lord: excluded he return’d
1318,CANTO VIII,To me with tardy steps. Upon the ground
1319,CANTO VIII,"His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras’d"
1320,CANTO VIII,"All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:"
1321,CANTO VIII,“Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?”
1322,CANTO VIII,"Then thus to me: “That I am anger’d, think"
1323,CANTO VIII,No ground of terror: in this trial I
1324,CANTO VIII,"Shall vanquish, use what arts they may within"
1325,CANTO VIII,"For hindrance. This their insolence, not new,"
1326,CANTO VIII,"Erewhile at gate less secret they display’d,"
1327,CANTO VIII,Which still is without bolt; upon its arch
1328,CANTO VIII,Thou saw’st the deadly scroll: and even now
1329,CANTO VIII,"On this side of its entrance, down the steep,"
1330,CANTO VIII,"Passing the circles, unescorted, comes"
1331,CANTO VIII,One whose strong might can open us this land.”
1332,CANTO VIII,
1333,CANTO VIII,
1334,CANTO VIII,
1335,CANTO VIII,
1336,CANTO IX,CANTO IX
1337,CANTO IX,
1338,CANTO IX,
1339,CANTO IX,"The hue, which coward dread on my pale cheeks"
1340,CANTO IX,"Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,"
1341,CANTO IX,"Chas’d that from his which newly they had worn,"
1342,CANTO IX,"And inwardly restrain’d it. He, as one"
1343,CANTO IX,"Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye"
1344,CANTO IX,"Not far could lead him through the sable air,"
1345,CANTO IX,And the thick-gath’ring cloud. “It yet behooves
1346,CANTO IX,We win this fight”—thus he began—” if not—
1347,CANTO IX,"Such aid to us is offer’d.—Oh, how long"
1348,CANTO IX,"Me seems it, ere the promis’d help arrive!”"
1349,CANTO IX,
1350,CANTO IX,"I noted, how the sequel of his words"
1351,CANTO IX,Clok’d their beginning; for the last he spake
1352,CANTO IX,Agreed not with the first. But not the less
1353,CANTO IX,My fear was at his saying; sith I drew
1354,CANTO IX,"To import worse perchance, than that he held,"
1355,CANTO IX,His mutilated speech. “Doth ever any
1356,CANTO IX,Into this rueful concave’s extreme depth
1357,CANTO IX,"Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain"
1358,CANTO IX,Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?”
1359,CANTO IX,
1360,CANTO IX,"Thus I inquiring. “Rarely,” he replied,"
1361,CANTO IX,"“It chances, that among us any makes"
1362,CANTO IX,"This journey, which I wend. Erewhile ’tis true"
1363,CANTO IX,"Once came I here beneath, conjur’d by fell"
1364,CANTO IX,"Erictho, sorceress, who compell’d the shades"
1365,CANTO IX,Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh
1366,CANTO IX,"Was naked of me, when within these walls"
1367,CANTO IX,"She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit"
1368,CANTO IX,From out of Judas’ circle. Lowest place
1369,CANTO IX,"Is that of all, obscurest, and remov’d"
1370,CANTO IX,Farthest from heav’n’s all-circling orb. The road
1371,CANTO IX,Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.
1372,CANTO IX,"That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round"
1373,CANTO IX,"The city’ of grief encompasses, which now"
1374,CANTO IX,We may not enter without rage.” Yet more
1375,CANTO IX,"He added: but I hold it not in mind,"
1376,CANTO IX,For that mine eye toward the lofty tower
1377,CANTO IX,"Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top."
1378,CANTO IX,Where in an instant I beheld uprisen
1379,CANTO IX,At once three hellish furies stain’d with blood:
1380,CANTO IX,In limb and motion feminine they seem’d;
1381,CANTO IX,Around them greenest hydras twisting roll’d
1382,CANTO IX,Their volumes; adders and cerastes crept
1383,CANTO IX,"Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound."
1384,CANTO IX,
1385,CANTO IX,He knowing well the miserable hags
1386,CANTO IX,"Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:"
1387,CANTO IX,“Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left
1388,CANTO IX,"This is Megaera; on the right hand she,"
1389,CANTO IX,"Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone"
1390,CANTO IX,"I’ th’ midst.” This said, in silence he remain’d"
1391,CANTO IX,Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves
1392,CANTO IX,"Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais’d,"
1393,CANTO IX,"That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound."
1394,CANTO IX,“Hasten Medusa: so to adamant
1395,CANTO IX,Him shall we change;” all looking down exclaim’d.
1396,CANTO IX,"“E’en when by Theseus’ might assail’d, we took"
1397,CANTO IX,"No ill revenge.” “Turn thyself round, and keep"
1398,CANTO IX,Thy count’nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire
1399,CANTO IX,"Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return"
1400,CANTO IX,"Upwards would be for ever lost.” This said,"
1401,CANTO IX,"Himself my gentle master turn’d me round,"
1402,CANTO IX,"Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own"
1403,CANTO IX,He also hid me. Ye of intellect
1404,CANTO IX,"Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal’d"
1405,CANTO IX,Under close texture of the mystic strain!
1406,CANTO IX,
1407,CANTO IX,And now there came o’er the perturbed waves
1408,CANTO IX,"Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made"
1409,CANTO IX,"Either shore tremble, as if of a wind"
1410,CANTO IX,"Impetuous, from conflicting vapours sprung,"
1411,CANTO IX,"That ’gainst some forest driving all its might,"
1412,CANTO IX,"Plucks off the branches, beats them down and hurls"
1413,CANTO IX,Afar; then onward passing proudly sweeps
1414,CANTO IX,"Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly."
1415,CANTO IX,
1416,CANTO IX,"Mine eyes he loos’d, and spake: “And now direct"
1417,CANTO IX,"Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,"
1418,CANTO IX,"There, thickest where the smoke ascends.” As frogs"
1419,CANTO IX,"Before their foe the serpent, through the wave"
1420,CANTO IX,"Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one"
1421,CANTO IX,Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits
1422,CANTO IX,"Destroy’d, so saw I fleeing before one"
1423,CANTO IX,Who pass’d with unwet feet the Stygian sound.
1424,CANTO IX,"He, from his face removing the gross air,"
1425,CANTO IX,"Oft his left hand forth stretch’d, and seem’d alone"
1426,CANTO IX,By that annoyance wearied. I perceiv’d
1427,CANTO IX,"That he was sent from heav’n, and to my guide"
1428,CANTO IX,"Turn’d me, who signal made that I should stand"
1429,CANTO IX,"Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full"
1430,CANTO IX,Of noble anger seem’d he! To the gate
1431,CANTO IX,"He came, and with his wand touch’d it, whereat"
1432,CANTO IX,Open without impediment it flew.
1433,CANTO IX,
1434,CANTO IX,“Outcasts of heav’n! O abject race and scorn’d!”
1435,CANTO IX,"Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,"
1436,CANTO IX,“Whence doth this wild excess of insolence
1437,CANTO IX,Lodge in you? wherefore kick you ’gainst that will
1438,CANTO IX,"Ne’er frustrate of its end, and which so oft"
1439,CANTO IX,Hath laid on you enforcement of your pangs?
1440,CANTO IX,What profits at the fays to but the horn?
1441,CANTO IX,"Your Cerberus, if ye remember, hence"
1442,CANTO IX,"Bears still, peel’d of their hair, his throat and maw.”"
1443,CANTO IX,
1444,CANTO IX,"This said, he turn’d back o’er the filthy way,"
1445,CANTO IX,"And syllable to us spake none, but wore"
1446,CANTO IX,The semblance of a man by other care
1447,CANTO IX,"Beset, and keenly press’d, than thought of him"
1448,CANTO IX,Who in his presence stands. Then we our steps
1449,CANTO IX,"Toward that territory mov’d, secure"
1450,CANTO IX,After the hallow’d words. We unoppos’d
1451,CANTO IX,There enter’d; and my mind eager to learn
1452,CANTO IX,"What state a fortress like to that might hold,"
1453,CANTO IX,"I soon as enter’d throw mine eye around,"
1454,CANTO IX,And see on every part wide-stretching space
1455,CANTO IX,Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.
1456,CANTO IX,
1457,CANTO IX,"As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles,"
1458,CANTO IX,"Or as at Pola, near Quarnaro’s gulf,"
1459,CANTO IX,"That closes Italy and laves her bounds,"
1460,CANTO IX,The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;
1461,CANTO IX,"So was it here, save what in horror here"
1462,CANTO IX,"Excell’d: for ’midst the graves were scattered flames,"
1463,CANTO IX,"Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn’d,"
1464,CANTO IX,That iron for no craft there hotter needs.
1465,CANTO IX,
1466,CANTO IX,"Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath"
1467,CANTO IX,"From them forth issu’d lamentable moans,"
1468,CANTO IX,Such as the sad and tortur’d well might raise.
1469,CANTO IX,
1470,CANTO IX,"I thus: “Master! say who are these, interr’d"
1471,CANTO IX,"Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear"
1472,CANTO IX,The dolorous sighs?” He answer thus return’d:
1473,CANTO IX,
1474,CANTO IX,"“The arch-heretics are here, accompanied"
1475,CANTO IX,"By every sect their followers; and much more,"
1476,CANTO IX,"Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like"
1477,CANTO IX,With like is buried; and the monuments
1478,CANTO IX,"Are different in degrees of heat. “This said,"
1479,CANTO IX,"He to the right hand turning, on we pass’d"
1480,CANTO IX,Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.
1481,CANTO IX,
1482,CANTO IX,
1483,CANTO IX,
1484,CANTO IX,
1485,CANTO X,CANTO X
1486,CANTO X,
1487,CANTO X,
1488,CANTO X,"Now by a secret pathway we proceed,"
1489,CANTO X,"Between the walls, that hem the region round,"
1490,CANTO X,"And the tormented souls: my master first,"
1491,CANTO X,I close behind his steps. “Virtue supreme!”
1492,CANTO X,I thus began; “who through these ample orbs
1493,CANTO X,"In circuit lead’st me, even as thou will’st,"
1494,CANTO X,"Speak thou, and satisfy my wish. May those,"
1495,CANTO X,"Who lie within these sepulchres, be seen?"
1496,CANTO X,"Already all the lids are rais’d, and none"
1497,CANTO X,O’er them keeps watch.” He thus in answer spake
1498,CANTO X,"“They shall be closed all, what-time they here"
1499,CANTO X,"From Josaphat return’d shall come, and bring"
1500,CANTO X,"Their bodies, which above they now have left."
1501,CANTO X,The cemetery on this part obtain
1502,CANTO X,"With Epicurus all his followers,"
1503,CANTO X,Who with the body make the spirit die.
1504,CANTO X,Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon
1505,CANTO X,"Both to the question ask’d, and to the wish,"
1506,CANTO X,Which thou conceal’st in silence.” I replied:
1507,CANTO X,"“I keep not, guide belov’d! from thee my heart"
1508,CANTO X,"Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,"
1509,CANTO X,A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.”
1510,CANTO X,
1511,CANTO X,“O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire
1512,CANTO X,"Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!"
1513,CANTO X,Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance
1514,CANTO X,Declares the place of thy nativity
1515,CANTO X,"To be that noble land, with which perchance"
1516,CANTO X,I too severely dealt.” Sudden that sound
1517,CANTO X,"Forth issu’d from a vault, whereat in fear"
1518,CANTO X,I somewhat closer to my leader’s side
1519,CANTO X,"Approaching, he thus spake: “What dost thou? Turn."
1520,CANTO X,"Lo, Farinata, there! who hath himself"
1521,CANTO X,Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all
1522,CANTO X,Expos’d behold him.” On his face was mine
1523,CANTO X,Already fix’d; his breast and forehead there
1524,CANTO X,"Erecting, seem’d as in high scorn he held"
1525,CANTO X,E’en hell. Between the sepulchres to him
1526,CANTO X,"My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,"
1527,CANTO X,This warning added: “See thy words be clear!”
1528,CANTO X,
1529,CANTO X,"He, soon as there I stood at the tomb’s foot,"
1530,CANTO X,"Ey’d me a space, then in disdainful mood"
1531,CANTO X,"Address’d me: “Say, what ancestors were thine?”"
1532,CANTO X,
1533,CANTO X,"I, willing to obey him, straight reveal’d"
1534,CANTO X,"The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow"
1535,CANTO X,"Somewhat uplifting, cried: “Fiercely were they"
1536,CANTO X,"Adverse to me, my party, and the blood"
1537,CANTO X,From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad
1538,CANTO X,"Scatter’d them.” “Though driv’n out, yet they each time"
1539,CANTO X,"From all parts,” answer’d I, “return’d; an art"
1540,CANTO X,"Which yours have shown, they are not skill’d to learn.”"
1541,CANTO X,
1542,CANTO X,"Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,"
1543,CANTO X,"Rose from his side a shade, high as the chin,"
1544,CANTO X,"Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais’d."
1545,CANTO X,"It look’d around, as eager to explore"
1546,CANTO X,If there were other with me; but perceiving
1547,CANTO X,"That fond imagination quench’d, with tears"
1548,CANTO X,Thus spake: “If thou through this blind prison go’st.
1549,CANTO X,"Led by thy lofty genius and profound,"
1550,CANTO X,Where is my son? and wherefore not with thee?”
1551,CANTO X,
1552,CANTO X,"I straight replied: “Not of myself I come,"
1553,CANTO X,"By him, who there expects me, through this clime"
1554,CANTO X,"Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son"
1555,CANTO X,Had in contempt.” Already had his words
1556,CANTO X,"And mode of punishment read me his name,"
1557,CANTO X,Whence I so fully answer’d. He at once
1558,CANTO X,"Exclaim’d, up starting, “How! said’st thou he HAD?"
1559,CANTO X,No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye
1560,CANTO X,The blessed daylight?” Then of some delay
1561,CANTO X,"I made ere my reply aware, down fell"
1562,CANTO X,"Supine, not after forth appear’d he more."
1563,CANTO X,
1564,CANTO X,"Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom"
1565,CANTO X,"I yet was station’d, chang’d not count’nance stern,"
1566,CANTO X,"Nor mov’d the neck, nor bent his ribbed side."
1567,CANTO X,"“And if,” continuing the first discourse,"
1568,CANTO X,"“They in this art,” he cried, “small skill have shown,"
1569,CANTO X,That doth torment me more e’en than this bed.
1570,CANTO X,But not yet fifty times shall be relum’d
1571,CANTO X,"Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,"
1572,CANTO X,Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.
1573,CANTO X,"So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,"
1574,CANTO X,"As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,"
1575,CANTO X,Against my kin this people is so fell?”
1576,CANTO X,
1577,CANTO X,"“The slaughter and great havoc,” I replied,"
1578,CANTO X,“That colour’d Arbia’s flood with crimson stain—
1579,CANTO X,"To these impute, that in our hallow’d dome"
1580,CANTO X,Such orisons ascend.” Sighing he shook
1581,CANTO X,"The head, then thus resum’d: “In that affray"
1582,CANTO X,"I stood not singly, nor without just cause"
1583,CANTO X,Assuredly should with the rest have stirr’d;
1584,CANTO X,"But singly there I stood, when by consent"
1585,CANTO X,"Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz’d,"
1586,CANTO X,The one who openly forbad the deed.”
1587,CANTO X,
1588,CANTO X,"“So may thy lineage find at last repose,”"
1589,CANTO X,"I thus adjur’d him, “as thou solve this knot,"
1590,CANTO X,"Which now involves my mind. If right I hear,"
1591,CANTO X,"Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time"
1592,CANTO X,"Leads with him, of the present uninform’d.”"
1593,CANTO X,
1594,CANTO X,"“We view, as one who hath an evil sight,”"
1595,CANTO X,"He answer’d, “plainly, objects far remote:"
1596,CANTO X,So much of his large spendour yet imparts
1597,CANTO X,The’ Almighty Ruler; but when they approach
1598,CANTO X,"Or actually exist, our intellect"
1599,CANTO X,"Then wholly fails, nor of your human state"
1600,CANTO X,Except what others bring us know we aught.
1601,CANTO X,"Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all"
1602,CANTO X,"Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,"
1603,CANTO X,When on futurity the portals close.”
1604,CANTO X,
1605,CANTO X,"Then conscious of my fault, and by remorse"
1606,CANTO X,"Smitten, I added thus: “Now shalt thou say"
1607,CANTO X,"To him there fallen, that his offspring still"
1608,CANTO X,"Is to the living join’d; and bid him know,"
1609,CANTO X,"That if from answer silent I abstain’d,"
1610,CANTO X,’Twas that my thought was occupied intent
1611,CANTO X,"Upon that error, which thy help hath solv’d.”"
1612,CANTO X,
1613,CANTO X,But now my master summoning me back
1614,CANTO X,"I heard, and with more eager haste besought"
1615,CANTO X,"The spirit to inform me, who with him"
1616,CANTO X,Partook his lot. He answer thus return’d:
1617,CANTO X,
1618,CANTO X,“More than a thousand with me here are laid
1619,CANTO X,"Within is Frederick, second of that name,"
1620,CANTO X,"And the Lord Cardinal, and of the rest"
1621,CANTO X,"I speak not.” He, this said, from sight withdrew."
1622,CANTO X,But I my steps towards the ancient bard
1623,CANTO X,"Reverting, ruminated on the words"
1624,CANTO X,"Betokening me such ill. Onward he mov’d,"
1625,CANTO X,And thus in going question’d: “Whence the’ amaze
1626,CANTO X,That holds thy senses wrapt?” I satisfied
1627,CANTO X,"The’ inquiry, and the sage enjoin’d me straight:"
1628,CANTO X,“Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard
1629,CANTO X,"To thee importing harm; and note thou this,”"
1630,CANTO X,"With his rais’d finger bidding me take heed,"
1631,CANTO X,
1632,CANTO X,"“When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam,"
1633,CANTO X,"Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life"
1634,CANTO X,The future tenour will to thee unfold.”
1635,CANTO X,
1636,CANTO X,Forthwith he to the left hand turn’d his feet:
1637,CANTO X,"We left the wall, and tow’rds the middle space"
1638,CANTO X,"Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;"
1639,CANTO X,Which e’en thus high exhal’d its noisome steam.
1640,CANTO X,
1641,CANTO X,
1642,CANTO X,
1643,CANTO X,
1644,CANTO XI,CANTO XI
1645,CANTO XI,
1646,CANTO XI,
1647,CANTO XI,"Upon the utmost verge of a high bank,"
1648,CANTO XI,"By craggy rocks environ’d round, we came,"
1649,CANTO XI,Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow’d:
1650,CANTO XI,And here to shun the horrible excess
1651,CANTO XI,"Of fetid exhalation, upward cast"
1652,CANTO XI,"From the profound abyss, behind the lid"
1653,CANTO XI,"Of a great monument we stood retir’d,"
1654,CANTO XI,Whereon this scroll I mark’d: “I have in charge
1655,CANTO XI,"Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew"
1656,CANTO XI,From the right path.—Ere our descent behooves
1657,CANTO XI,"We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,"
1658,CANTO XI,"To the dire breath accustom’d, afterward"
1659,CANTO XI,Regard it not.” My master thus; to whom
1660,CANTO XI,Answering I spake: “Some compensation find
1661,CANTO XI,That the time past not wholly lost.” He then:
1662,CANTO XI,“Lo! how my thoughts e’en to thy wishes tend!
1663,CANTO XI,"My son! within these rocks,” he thus began,"
1664,CANTO XI,"“Are three close circles in gradation plac’d,"
1665,CANTO XI,As these which now thou leav’st. Each one is full
1666,CANTO XI,Of spirits accurs’d; but that the sight alone
1667,CANTO XI,"Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how"
1668,CANTO XI,And for what cause in durance they abide.
1669,CANTO XI,
1670,CANTO XI,"“Of all malicious act abhorr’d in heaven,"
1671,CANTO XI,The end is injury; and all such end
1672,CANTO XI,Either by force or fraud works other’s woe
1673,CANTO XI,"But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,"
1674,CANTO XI,To God is more displeasing; and beneath
1675,CANTO XI,The fraudulent are therefore doom’d to’ endure
1676,CANTO XI,Severer pang. The violent occupy
1677,CANTO XI,All the first circle; and because to force
1678,CANTO XI,"Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds"
1679,CANTO XI,Hach within other sep’rate is it fram’d.
1680,CANTO XI,"To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man"
1681,CANTO XI,Force may be offer’d; to himself I say
1682,CANTO XI,"And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear"
1683,CANTO XI,"At full. Death, violent death, and painful wounds"
1684,CANTO XI,Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes
1685,CANTO XI,"By devastation, pillage, and the flames,"
1686,CANTO XI,"His substance. Slayers, and each one that smites"
1687,CANTO XI,"In malice, plund’rers, and all robbers, hence"
1688,CANTO XI,The torment undergo of the first round
1689,CANTO XI,In different herds. Man can do violence
1690,CANTO XI,To himself and his own blessings: and for this
1691,CANTO XI,He in the second round must aye deplore
1692,CANTO XI,"With unavailing penitence his crime,"
1693,CANTO XI,"Whoe’er deprives himself of life and light,"
1694,CANTO XI,"In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,"
1695,CANTO XI,And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.
1696,CANTO XI,"To God may force be offer’d, in the heart"
1697,CANTO XI,"Denying and blaspheming his high power,"
1698,CANTO XI,And nature with her kindly law contemning.
1699,CANTO XI,And thence the inmost round marks with its seal
1700,CANTO XI,"Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak"
1701,CANTO XI,Contemptuously’ of the Godhead in their hearts.
1702,CANTO XI,
1703,CANTO XI,"“Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,"
1704,CANTO XI,"May be by man employ’d on one, whose trust"
1705,CANTO XI,"He wins, or on another who withholds"
1706,CANTO XI,Strict confidence. Seems as the latter way
1707,CANTO XI,Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.
1708,CANTO XI,Whence in the second circle have their nest
1709,CANTO XI,"Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,"
1710,CANTO XI,"Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce"
1711,CANTO XI,"To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,"
1712,CANTO XI,With such vile scum as these. The other way
1713,CANTO XI,"Forgets both Nature’s general love, and that"
1714,CANTO XI,Which thereto added afterwards gives birth
1715,CANTO XI,"To special faith. Whence in the lesser circle,"
1716,CANTO XI,"Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,"
1717,CANTO XI,The traitor is eternally consum’d.”
1718,CANTO XI,
1719,CANTO XI,"I thus: “Instructor, clearly thy discourse"
1720,CANTO XI,"Proceeds, distinguishing the hideous chasm"
1721,CANTO XI,And its inhabitants with skill exact.
1722,CANTO XI,"But tell me this: they of the dull, fat pool,"
1723,CANTO XI,"Whom the rain beats, or whom the tempest drives,"
1724,CANTO XI,"Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,"
1725,CANTO XI,Wherefore within the city fire-illum’d
1726,CANTO XI,"Are not these punish’d, if God’s wrath be on them?"
1727,CANTO XI,"And if it be not, wherefore in such guise"
1728,CANTO XI,Are they condemned?” He answer thus return’d:
1729,CANTO XI,"“Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,"
1730,CANTO XI,Not so accustom’d? or what other thoughts
1731,CANTO XI,Possess it? Dwell not in thy memory
1732,CANTO XI,"The words, wherein thy ethic page describes"
1733,CANTO XI,"Three dispositions adverse to Heav’n’s will,"
1734,CANTO XI,"Incont’nence, malice, and mad brutishness,"
1735,CANTO XI,And how incontinence the least offends
1736,CANTO XI,"God, and least guilt incurs? If well thou note"
1737,CANTO XI,"This judgment, and remember who they are,"
1738,CANTO XI,"Without these walls to vain repentance doom’d,"
1739,CANTO XI,Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac’d
1740,CANTO XI,"From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours"
1741,CANTO XI,Justice divine on them its vengeance down.”
1742,CANTO XI,
1743,CANTO XI,"“O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,"
1744,CANTO XI,"Thou so content’st me, when thou solv’st my doubt,"
1745,CANTO XI,That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.
1746,CANTO XI,"Yet somewhat turn thee back,” I in these words"
1747,CANTO XI,"Continu’d, “where thou saidst, that usury"
1748,CANTO XI,Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot
1749,CANTO XI,Perplex’d unravel.” He thus made reply:
1750,CANTO XI,"“Philosophy, to an attentive ear,"
1751,CANTO XI,"Clearly points out, not in one part alone,"
1752,CANTO XI,How imitative nature takes her course
1753,CANTO XI,From the celestial mind and from its art:
1754,CANTO XI,"And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,"
1755,CANTO XI,"Not many leaves scann’d o’er, observing well"
1756,CANTO XI,"Thou shalt discover, that your art on her"
1757,CANTO XI,"Obsequious follows, as the learner treads"
1758,CANTO XI,"In his instructor’s step, so that your art"
1759,CANTO XI,Deserves the name of second in descent
1760,CANTO XI,"From God. These two, if thou recall to mind"
1761,CANTO XI,"Creation’s holy book, from the beginning"
1762,CANTO XI,Were the right source of life and excellence
1763,CANTO XI,To human kind. But in another path
1764,CANTO XI,The usurer walks; and Nature in herself
1765,CANTO XI,"And in her follower thus he sets at nought,"
1766,CANTO XI,Placing elsewhere his hope. But follow now
1767,CANTO XI,My steps on forward journey bent; for now
1768,CANTO XI,The Pisces play with undulating glance
1769,CANTO XI,"Along the’ horizon, and the Wain lies all"
1770,CANTO XI,O’er the north-west; and onward there a space
1771,CANTO XI,Is our steep passage down the rocky height.”
1772,CANTO XI,
1773,CANTO XI,
1774,CANTO XI,
1775,CANTO XI,
1776,CANTO XII,CANTO XII
1777,CANTO XII,
1778,CANTO XII,
1779,CANTO XII,The place where to descend the precipice
1780,CANTO XII,"We came, was rough as Alp, and on its verge"
1781,CANTO XII,"Such object lay, as every eye would shun."
1782,CANTO XII,
1783,CANTO XII,"As is that ruin, which Adice’s stream"
1784,CANTO XII,"On this side Trento struck, should’ring the wave,"
1785,CANTO XII,Or loos’d by earthquake or for lack of prop;
1786,CANTO XII,"For from the mountain’s summit, whence it mov’d"
1787,CANTO XII,"To the low level, so the headlong rock"
1788,CANTO XII,"Is shiver’d, that some passage it might give"
1789,CANTO XII,To him who from above would pass; e’en such
1790,CANTO XII,Into the chasm was that descent: and there
1791,CANTO XII,At point of the disparted ridge lay stretch’d
1792,CANTO XII,"The infamy of Crete, detested brood"
1793,CANTO XII,Of the feign’d heifer: and at sight of us
1794,CANTO XII,"It gnaw’d itself, as one with rage distract."
1795,CANTO XII,To him my guide exclaim’d: “Perchance thou deem’st
1796,CANTO XII,"The King of Athens here, who, in the world"
1797,CANTO XII,"Above, thy death contriv’d. Monster! avaunt!"
1798,CANTO XII,"He comes not tutor’d by thy sister’s art,"
1799,CANTO XII,But to behold your torments is he come.”
1800,CANTO XII,
1801,CANTO XII,"Like to a bull, that with impetuous spring"
1802,CANTO XII,"Darts, at the moment when the fatal blow"
1803,CANTO XII,"Hath struck him, but unable to proceed"
1804,CANTO XII,Plunges on either side; so saw I plunge
1805,CANTO XII,The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim’d:
1806,CANTO XII,"“Run to the passage! while he storms, ’tis well"
1807,CANTO XII,That thou descend.” Thus down our road we took
1808,CANTO XII,"Through those dilapidated crags, that oft"
1809,CANTO XII,"Mov’d underneath my feet, to weight like theirs"
1810,CANTO XII,"Unus’d. I pond’ring went, and thus he spake:"
1811,CANTO XII,
1812,CANTO XII,"“Perhaps thy thoughts are of this ruin’d steep,"
1813,CANTO XII,"Guarded by the brute violence, which I"
1814,CANTO XII,"Have vanquish’d now. Know then, that when I erst"
1815,CANTO XII,"Hither descended to the nether hell,"
1816,CANTO XII,This rock was not yet fallen. But past doubt
1817,CANTO XII,"(If well I mark) not long ere He arrived,"
1818,CANTO XII,Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil
1819,CANTO XII,"Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds"
1820,CANTO XII,"Such trembling seiz’d the deep concave and foul,"
1821,CANTO XII,"I thought the universe was thrill’d with love,"
1822,CANTO XII,"Whereby, there are who deem, the world hath oft"
1823,CANTO XII,"Been into chaos turn’d: and in that point,"
1824,CANTO XII,"Here, and elsewhere, that old rock toppled down."
1825,CANTO XII,But fix thine eyes beneath: the river of blood
1826,CANTO XII,"Approaches, in the which all those are steep’d,"
1827,CANTO XII,Who have by violence injur’d.” O blind lust!
1828,CANTO XII,O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on
1829,CANTO XII,"In the brief life, and in the eternal then"
1830,CANTO XII,Thus miserably o’erwhelm us. I beheld
1831,CANTO XII,"An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,"
1832,CANTO XII,As circling all the plain; for so my guide
1833,CANTO XII,Had told. Between it and the rampart’s base
1834,CANTO XII,"On trail ran Centaurs, with keen arrows arm’d,"
1835,CANTO XII,As to the chase they on the earth were wont.
1836,CANTO XII,
1837,CANTO XII,At seeing us descend they each one stood;
1838,CANTO XII,"And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows"
1839,CANTO XII,And missile weapons chosen first; of whom
1840,CANTO XII,One cried from far: “Say to what pain ye come
1841,CANTO XII,"Condemn’d, who down this steep have journied? Speak"
1842,CANTO XII,"From whence ye stand, or else the bow I draw.”"
1843,CANTO XII,
1844,CANTO XII,To whom my guide: “Our answer shall be made
1845,CANTO XII,"To Chiron, there, when nearer him we come."
1846,CANTO XII,"Ill was thy mind, thus ever quick and rash.”"
1847,CANTO XII,
1848,CANTO XII,"Then me he touch’d, and spake: “Nessus is this,"
1849,CANTO XII,"Who for the fair Deianira died,"
1850,CANTO XII,And wrought himself revenge for his own fate.
1851,CANTO XII,"He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,"
1852,CANTO XII,Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs’d;
1853,CANTO XII,"That other Pholus, prone to wrath.” Around"
1854,CANTO XII,"The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts"
1855,CANTO XII,At whatsoever spirit dares emerge
1856,CANTO XII,"From out the blood, more than his guilt allows."
1857,CANTO XII,
1858,CANTO XII,"We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,"
1859,CANTO XII,"Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,"
1860,CANTO XII,And with the notch push’d back his shaggy beard
1861,CANTO XII,"To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view"
1862,CANTO XII,"Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim’d:"
1863,CANTO XII,"“Are ye aware, that he who comes behind"
1864,CANTO XII,Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead
1865,CANTO XII,"Are not so wont.” My trusty guide, who now"
1866,CANTO XII,"Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,"
1867,CANTO XII,"Thus made reply: “He is indeed alive,"
1868,CANTO XII,And solitary so must needs by me
1869,CANTO XII,"Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc’d"
1870,CANTO XII,"By strict necessity, not by delight."
1871,CANTO XII,"She left her joyful harpings in the sky,"
1872,CANTO XII,Who this new office to my care consign’d.
1873,CANTO XII,"He is no robber, no dark spirit I."
1874,CANTO XII,"But by that virtue, which empowers my step"
1875,CANTO XII,"To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,"
1876,CANTO XII,"One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,"
1877,CANTO XII,"Who to the ford may lead us, and convey"
1878,CANTO XII,"Across, him mounted on his back; for he"
1879,CANTO XII,Is not a spirit that may walk the air.”
1880,CANTO XII,
1881,CANTO XII,"Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus"
1882,CANTO XII,"To Nessus spake: “Return, and be their guide."
1883,CANTO XII,"And if ye chance to cross another troop,"
1884,CANTO XII,"Command them keep aloof.” Onward we mov’d,"
1885,CANTO XII,"The faithful escort by our side, along"
1886,CANTO XII,"The border of the crimson-seething flood,"
1887,CANTO XII,Whence from those steep’d within loud shrieks arose.
1888,CANTO XII,
1889,CANTO XII,"Some there I mark’d, as high as to their brow"
1890,CANTO XII,"Immers’d, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:"
1891,CANTO XII,"“These are the souls of tyrants, who were given"
1892,CANTO XII,To blood and rapine. Here they wail aloud
1893,CANTO XII,"Their merciless wrongs. Here Alexander dwells,"
1894,CANTO XII,"And Dionysius fell, who many a year"
1895,CANTO XII,Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. That brow
1896,CANTO XII,"Whereon the hair so jetty clust’ring hangs,"
1897,CANTO XII,Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks
1898,CANTO XII,"Obizzo’ of Este, in the world destroy’d"
1899,CANTO XII,By his foul step-son.” To the bard rever’d
1900,CANTO XII,"I turned me round, and thus he spake; “Let him"
1901,CANTO XII,"Be to thee now first leader, me but next"
1902,CANTO XII,To him in rank.” Then farther on a space
1903,CANTO XII,"The Centaur paus’d, near some, who at the throat"
1904,CANTO XII,Were extant from the wave; and showing us
1905,CANTO XII,"A spirit by itself apart retir’d,"
1906,CANTO XII,"Exclaim’d: “He in God’s bosom smote the heart,"
1907,CANTO XII,Which yet is honour’d on the bank of Thames.”
1908,CANTO XII,
1909,CANTO XII,"A race I next espied, who held the head,"
1910,CANTO XII,And even all the bust above the stream.
1911,CANTO XII,’Midst these I many a face remember’d well.
1912,CANTO XII,"Thus shallow more and more the blood became,"
1913,CANTO XII,So that at last it but imbru’d the feet;
1914,CANTO XII,And there our passage lay athwart the foss.
1915,CANTO XII,
1916,CANTO XII,“As ever on this side the boiling wave
1917,CANTO XII,"Thou seest diminishing,” the Centaur said,"
1918,CANTO XII,"“So on the other, be thou well assur’d,"
1919,CANTO XII,"It lower still and lower sinks its bed,"
1920,CANTO XII,"Till in that part it reuniting join,"
1921,CANTO XII,Where ’tis the lot of tyranny to mourn.
1922,CANTO XII,There Heav’n’s stern justice lays chastising hand
1923,CANTO XII,"On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,"
1924,CANTO XII,"On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts"
1925,CANTO XII,Tears ever by the seething flood unlock’d
1926,CANTO XII,"From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,"
1927,CANTO XII,"Pazzo the other nam’d, who fill’d the ways"
1928,CANTO XII,"With violence and war.” This said, he turn’d,"
1929,CANTO XII,"And quitting us, alone repass’d the ford."
1930,CANTO XII,
1931,CANTO XII,
1932,CANTO XII,
1933,CANTO XII,
1934,CANTO XIII,CANTO XIII
1935,CANTO XIII,
1936,CANTO XIII,
1937,CANTO XIII,"Ere Nessus yet had reach’d the other bank,"
1938,CANTO XIII,"We enter’d on a forest, where no track"
1939,CANTO XIII,Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there
1940,CANTO XIII,"The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light"
1941,CANTO XIII,"The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform’d"
1942,CANTO XIII,"And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns"
1943,CANTO XIII,"Instead, with venom fill’d. Less sharp than these,"
1944,CANTO XIII,"Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide"
1945,CANTO XIII,"Those animals, that hate the cultur’d fields,"
1946,CANTO XIII,Betwixt Corneto and Cecina’s stream.
1947,CANTO XIII,
1948,CANTO XIII,"Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same"
1949,CANTO XIII,Who from the Strophades the Trojan band
1950,CANTO XIII,Drove with dire boding of their future woe.
1951,CANTO XIII,"Broad are their pennons, of the human form"
1952,CANTO XIII,"Their neck and count’nance, arm’d with talons keen"
1953,CANTO XIII,"The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings"
1954,CANTO XIII,These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.
1955,CANTO XIII,
1956,CANTO XIII,The kind instructor in these words began:
1957,CANTO XIII,"“Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now"
1958,CANTO XIII,"I’ th’ second round, and shalt be, till thou come"
1959,CANTO XIII,Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well
1960,CANTO XIII,"Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,"
1961,CANTO XIII,As would my speech discredit.” On all sides
1962,CANTO XIII,"I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see"
1963,CANTO XIII,From whom they might have issu’d. In amaze
1964,CANTO XIII,"Fast bound I stood. He, as it seem’d, believ’d,"
1965,CANTO XIII,That I had thought so many voices came
1966,CANTO XIII,"From some amid those thickets close conceal’d,"
1967,CANTO XIII,And thus his speech resum’d: “If thou lop off
1968,CANTO XIII,"A single twig from one of those ill plants,"
1969,CANTO XIII,The thought thou hast conceiv’d shall vanish quite.”
1970,CANTO XIII,
1971,CANTO XIII,"Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,"
1972,CANTO XIII,"From a great wilding gather’d I a branch,"
1973,CANTO XIII,And straight the trunk exclaim’d: “Why pluck’st thou me?”
1974,CANTO XIII,"Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,"
1975,CANTO XIII,These words it added: “Wherefore tear’st me thus?
1976,CANTO XIII,Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?
1977,CANTO XIII,"Men once were we, that now are rooted here."
1978,CANTO XIII,"Thy hand might well have spar’d us, had we been"
1979,CANTO XIII,"The souls of serpents.” As a brand yet green,"
1980,CANTO XIII,That burning at one end from the’ other sends
1981,CANTO XIII,"A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind"
1982,CANTO XIII,"That forces out its way, so burst at once,"
1983,CANTO XIII,Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.
1984,CANTO XIII,
1985,CANTO XIII,"I, letting fall the bough, remain’d as one"
1986,CANTO XIII,"Assail’d by terror, and the sage replied:"
1987,CANTO XIII,"“If he, O injur’d spirit! could have believ’d"
1988,CANTO XIII,"What he hath seen but in my verse describ’d,"
1989,CANTO XIII,He never against thee had stretch’d his hand.
1990,CANTO XIII,"But I, because the thing surpass’d belief,"
1991,CANTO XIII,"Prompted him to this deed, which even now"
1992,CANTO XIII,"Myself I rue. But tell me, who thou wast;"
1993,CANTO XIII,"That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,"
1994,CANTO XIII,In the upper world (for thither to return
1995,CANTO XIII,Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.”
1996,CANTO XIII,
1997,CANTO XIII,"“That pleasant word of thine,” the trunk replied"
1998,CANTO XIII,"“Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech"
1999,CANTO XIII,"Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge"
2000,CANTO XIII,"A little longer, in the snare detain’d,"
2001,CANTO XIII,"Count it not grievous. I it was, who held"
2002,CANTO XIII,"Both keys to Frederick’s heart, and turn’d the wards,"
2003,CANTO XIII,"Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,"
2004,CANTO XIII,"That besides me, into his inmost breast"
2005,CANTO XIII,Scarce any other could admittance find.
2006,CANTO XIII,"The faith I bore to my high charge was such,"
2007,CANTO XIII,It cost me the life-blood that warm’d my veins.
2008,CANTO XIII,"The harlot, who ne’er turn’d her gloating eyes"
2009,CANTO XIII,"From Caesar’s household, common vice and pest"
2010,CANTO XIII,"Of courts, ’gainst me inflam’d the minds of all;"
2011,CANTO XIII,"And to Augustus they so spread the flame,"
2012,CANTO XIII,That my glad honours chang’d to bitter woes.
2013,CANTO XIII,"My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought"
2014,CANTO XIII,"Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,"
2015,CANTO XIII,"Just as I was, unjust toward myself."
2016,CANTO XIII,"By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,"
2017,CANTO XIII,"That never faith I broke to my liege lord,"
2018,CANTO XIII,"Who merited such honour; and of you,"
2019,CANTO XIII,"If any to the world indeed return,"
2020,CANTO XIII,"Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies"
2021,CANTO XIII,Yet prostrate under envy’s cruel blow.”
2022,CANTO XIII,
2023,CANTO XIII,"First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words"
2024,CANTO XIII,"Were ended, then to me the bard began:"
2025,CANTO XIII,"“Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,"
2026,CANTO XIII,If more thou wish to learn.” Whence I replied:
2027,CANTO XIII,“Question thou him again of whatsoe’er
2028,CANTO XIII,"Will, as thou think’st, content me; for no power"
2029,CANTO XIII,"Have I to ask, such pity’ is at my heart.”"
2030,CANTO XIII,
2031,CANTO XIII,He thus resum’d; “So may he do for thee
2032,CANTO XIII,"Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet"
2033,CANTO XIII,"Be pleas’d, imprison’d Spirit! to declare,"
2034,CANTO XIII,How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;
2035,CANTO XIII,And whether any ever from such frame
2036,CANTO XIII,"Be loosen’d, if thou canst, that also tell.”"
2037,CANTO XIII,
2038,CANTO XIII,"Thereat the trunk breath’d hard, and the wind soon"
2039,CANTO XIII,Chang’d into sounds articulate like these;
2040,CANTO XIII,
2041,CANTO XIII,Briefly ye shall be answer’d. When departs
2042,CANTO XIII,"The fierce soul from the body, by itself"
2043,CANTO XIII,"Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf"
2044,CANTO XIII,"By Minos doom’d, into the wood it falls,"
2045,CANTO XIII,"No place assign’d, but wheresoever chance"
2046,CANTO XIII,"Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,"
2047,CANTO XIII,"It rises to a sapling, growing thence"
2048,CANTO XIII,"A savage plant. The Harpies, on its leaves"
2049,CANTO XIII,"Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain"
2050,CANTO XIII,"A vent to grief. We, as the rest, shall come"
2051,CANTO XIII,"For our own spoils, yet not so that with them"
2052,CANTO XIII,We may again be clad; for what a man
2053,CANTO XIII,Takes from himself it is not just he have.
2054,CANTO XIII,Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout
2055,CANTO XIII,"The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,"
2056,CANTO XIII,Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.”
2057,CANTO XIII,
2058,CANTO XIII,Attentive yet to listen to the trunk
2059,CANTO XIII,"We stood, expecting farther speech, when us"
2060,CANTO XIII,"A noise surpris’d, as when a man perceives"
2061,CANTO XIII,The wild boar and the hunt approach his place
2062,CANTO XIII,"Of station’d watch, who of the beasts and boughs"
2063,CANTO XIII,Loud rustling round him hears. And lo! there came
2064,CANTO XIII,"Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,"
2065,CANTO XIII,That they before them broke each fan o’ th’ wood.
2066,CANTO XIII,"“Haste now,” the foremost cried, “now haste thee death!”"
2067,CANTO XIII,"The’ other, as seem’d, impatient of delay"
2068,CANTO XIII,"Exclaiming, “Lano! not so bent for speed"
2069,CANTO XIII,"Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo’s field.”"
2070,CANTO XIII,"And then, for that perchance no longer breath"
2071,CANTO XIII,"Suffic’d him, of himself and of a bush"
2072,CANTO XIII,One group he made. Behind them was the wood
2073,CANTO XIII,"Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,"
2074,CANTO XIII,As greyhounds that have newly slipp’d the leash.
2075,CANTO XIII,"On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,"
2076,CANTO XIII,And having rent him piecemeal bore away
2077,CANTO XIII,"The tortur’d limbs. My guide then seiz’d my hand,"
2078,CANTO XIII,"And led me to the thicket, which in vain"
2079,CANTO XIII,Mourn’d through its bleeding wounds: “O Giacomo
2080,CANTO XIII,"Of Sant’ Andrea! what avails it thee,”"
2081,CANTO XIII,"It cried, “that of me thou hast made thy screen?"
2082,CANTO XIII,For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?”
2083,CANTO XIII,
2084,CANTO XIII,"When o’er it he had paus’d, my master spake:"
2085,CANTO XIII,"“Say who wast thou, that at so many points"
2086,CANTO XIII,Breath’st out with blood thy lamentable speech?”
2087,CANTO XIII,
2088,CANTO XIII,"He answer’d: “Oh, ye spirits: arriv’d in time"
2089,CANTO XIII,"To spy the shameful havoc, that from me"
2090,CANTO XIII,"My leaves hath sever’d thus, gather them up,"
2091,CANTO XIII,And at the foot of their sad parent-tree
2092,CANTO XIII,"Carefully lay them. In that city’ I dwelt,"
2093,CANTO XIII,"Who for the Baptist her first patron chang’d,"
2094,CANTO XIII,Whence he for this shall cease not with his art
2095,CANTO XIII,To work her woe: and if there still remain’d not
2096,CANTO XIII,"On Arno’s passage some faint glimpse of him,"
2097,CANTO XIII,"Those citizens, who rear’d once more her walls"
2098,CANTO XIII,"Upon the ashes left by Attila,"
2099,CANTO XIII,Had labour’d without profit of their toil.
2100,CANTO XIII,I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.”
2101,CANTO XIII,
2102,CANTO XIII,
2103,CANTO XIII,
2104,CANTO XIII,
2105,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
2106,CANTO XIV,
2107,CANTO XIV,
2108,CANTO XIV,Soon as the charity of native land
2109,CANTO XIV,"Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter’d leaves"
2110,CANTO XIV,"Collected, and to him restor’d, who now"
2111,CANTO XIV,Was hoarse with utt’rance. To the limit thence
2112,CANTO XIV,"We came, which from the third the second round"
2113,CANTO XIV,"Divides, and where of justice is display’d"
2114,CANTO XIV,Contrivance horrible. Things then first seen
2115,CANTO XIV,"Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next"
2116,CANTO XIV,"A plain we reach’d, that from its sterile bed"
2117,CANTO XIV,Each plant repell’d. The mournful wood waves round
2118,CANTO XIV,"Its garland on all sides, as round the wood"
2119,CANTO XIV,"Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge,"
2120,CANTO XIV,Our steps we stay’d. It was an area wide
2121,CANTO XIV,"Of arid sand and thick, resembling most"
2122,CANTO XIV,The soil that erst by Cato’s foot was trod.
2123,CANTO XIV,
2124,CANTO XIV,Vengeance of Heav’n! Oh ! how shouldst thou be fear’d
2125,CANTO XIV,"By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!"
2126,CANTO XIV,
2127,CANTO XIV,"Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,"
2128,CANTO XIV,"All weeping piteously, to different laws"
2129,CANTO XIV,"Subjected: for on the’ earth some lay supine,"
2130,CANTO XIV,"Some crouching close were seated, others pac’d"
2131,CANTO XIV,"Incessantly around; the latter tribe,"
2132,CANTO XIV,"More numerous, those fewer who beneath"
2133,CANTO XIV,"The torment lay, but louder in their grief."
2134,CANTO XIV,
2135,CANTO XIV,O’er all the sand fell slowly wafting down
2136,CANTO XIV,"Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow"
2137,CANTO XIV,"On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush’d."
2138,CANTO XIV,"As in the torrid Indian clime, the son"
2139,CANTO XIV,Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band
2140,CANTO XIV,"Descending, solid flames, that to the ground"
2141,CANTO XIV,Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop
2142,CANTO XIV,To trample on the soil; for easier thus
2143,CANTO XIV,"The vapour was extinguish’d, while alone;"
2144,CANTO XIV,"So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith"
2145,CANTO XIV,"The marble glow’d underneath, as under stove"
2146,CANTO XIV,"The viands, doubly to augment the pain."
2147,CANTO XIV,"Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,"
2148,CANTO XIV,"Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off"
2149,CANTO XIV,"The heat, still falling fresh. I thus began:"
2150,CANTO XIV,"“Instructor! thou who all things overcom’st,"
2151,CANTO XIV,"Except the hardy demons, that rush’d forth"
2152,CANTO XIV,"To stop our entrance at the gate, say who"
2153,CANTO XIV,"Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not"
2154,CANTO XIV,"The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,"
2155,CANTO XIV,As by the sultry tempest immatur’d?”
2156,CANTO XIV,
2157,CANTO XIV,"Straight he himself, who was aware I ask’d"
2158,CANTO XIV,"My guide of him, exclaim’d: “Such as I was"
2159,CANTO XIV,"When living, dead such now I am. If Jove"
2160,CANTO XIV,"Weary his workman out, from whom in ire"
2161,CANTO XIV,"He snatch’d the lightnings, that at my last day"
2162,CANTO XIV,"Transfix’d me, if the rest be weary out"
2163,CANTO XIV,At their black smithy labouring by turns
2164,CANTO XIV,"In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;"
2165,CANTO XIV,"“Help, help, good Mulciber!” as erst he cried"
2166,CANTO XIV,"In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts"
2167,CANTO XIV,"Launch he full aim’d at me with all his might,"
2168,CANTO XIV,He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.”
2169,CANTO XIV,
2170,CANTO XIV,"Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais’d"
2171,CANTO XIV,Than I before had heard him: “Capaneus!
2172,CANTO XIV,"Thou art more punish’d, in that this thy pride"
2173,CANTO XIV,"Lives yet unquench’d: no torrent, save thy rage,"
2174,CANTO XIV,Were to thy fury pain proportion’d full.”
2175,CANTO XIV,
2176,CANTO XIV,Next turning round to me with milder lip
2177,CANTO XIV,"He spake: “This of the seven kings was one,"
2178,CANTO XIV,"Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,"
2179,CANTO XIV,"As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,"
2180,CANTO XIV,And sets his high omnipotence at nought.
2181,CANTO XIV,"But, as I told him, his despiteful mood"
2182,CANTO XIV,Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.
2183,CANTO XIV,Follow me now; and look thou set not yet
2184,CANTO XIV,"Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood"
2185,CANTO XIV,Keep ever close.” Silently on we pass’d
2186,CANTO XIV,To where there gushes from the forest’s bound
2187,CANTO XIV,"A little brook, whose crimson’d wave yet lifts"
2188,CANTO XIV,"My hair with horror. As the rill, that runs"
2189,CANTO XIV,"From Bulicame, to be portion’d out"
2190,CANTO XIV,Among the sinful women; so ran this
2191,CANTO XIV,"Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank"
2192,CANTO XIV,"Stone-built, and either margin at its side,"
2193,CANTO XIV,Whereon I straight perceiv’d our passage lay.
2194,CANTO XIV,
2195,CANTO XIV,"“Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate"
2196,CANTO XIV,"We enter’d first, whose threshold is to none"
2197,CANTO XIV,"Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,"
2198,CANTO XIV,"As is this river, has thine eye discern’d,"
2199,CANTO XIV,O’er which the flaming volley all is quench’d.”
2200,CANTO XIV,
2201,CANTO XIV,"So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,"
2202,CANTO XIV,"That having giv’n me appetite to know,"
2203,CANTO XIV,"The food he too would give, that hunger crav’d."
2204,CANTO XIV,
2205,CANTO XIV,"“In midst of ocean,” forthwith he began,"
2206,CANTO XIV,"“A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam’d,"
2207,CANTO XIV,Under whose monarch in old times the world
2208,CANTO XIV,"Liv’d pure and chaste. A mountain rises there,"
2209,CANTO XIV,"Call’d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,"
2210,CANTO XIV,Deserted now like a forbidden thing.
2211,CANTO XIV,"It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn’s spouse,"
2212,CANTO XIV,Chose for the secret cradle of her son;
2213,CANTO XIV,"And better to conceal him, drown’d in shouts"
2214,CANTO XIV,"His infant cries. Within the mount, upright"
2215,CANTO XIV,"An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns"
2216,CANTO XIV,"His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome"
2217,CANTO XIV,As in his mirror looks. Of finest gold
2218,CANTO XIV,"His head is shap’d, pure silver are the breast"
2219,CANTO XIV,And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.
2220,CANTO XIV,"And downward all beneath well-temper’d steel,"
2221,CANTO XIV,"Save the right foot of potter’s clay, on which"
2222,CANTO XIV,"Than on the other more erect he stands,"
2223,CANTO XIV,"Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;"
2224,CANTO XIV,"And from the fissure tears distil, which join’d"
2225,CANTO XIV,Penetrate to that cave. They in their course
2226,CANTO XIV,Thus far precipitated down the rock
2227,CANTO XIV,"Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;"
2228,CANTO XIV,Then by this straiten’d channel passing hence
2229,CANTO XIV,"Beneath, e’en to the lowest depth of all,"
2230,CANTO XIV,"Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself"
2231,CANTO XIV,Shall see it) I here give thee no account.”
2232,CANTO XIV,
2233,CANTO XIV,Then I to him: “If from our world this sluice
2234,CANTO XIV,Be thus deriv’d; wherefore to us but now
2235,CANTO XIV,Appears it at this edge?” He straight replied:
2236,CANTO XIV,"“The place, thou know’st, is round; and though great part"
2237,CANTO XIV,"Thou have already pass’d, still to the left"
2238,CANTO XIV,"Descending to the nethermost, not yet"
2239,CANTO XIV,Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.
2240,CANTO XIV,"Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,"
2241,CANTO XIV,It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.”
2242,CANTO XIV,
2243,CANTO XIV,Then I again inquir’d: “Where flow the streams
2244,CANTO XIV,Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one
2245,CANTO XIV,"Thou tell’st not, and the other of that shower,"
2246,CANTO XIV,"Thou say’st, is form’d.” He answer thus return’d:"
2247,CANTO XIV,“Doubtless thy questions all well pleas’d I hear.
2248,CANTO XIV,Yet the red seething wave might have resolv’d
2249,CANTO XIV,"One thou proposest. Lethe thou shalt see,"
2250,CANTO XIV,"But not within this hollow, in the place,"
2251,CANTO XIV,"Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,"
2252,CANTO XIV,Whose blame hath been by penitence remov’d.”
2253,CANTO XIV,He added: “Time is now we quit the wood.
2254,CANTO XIV,Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give
2255,CANTO XIV,"Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;"
2256,CANTO XIV,For over them all vapour is extinct.”
2257,CANTO XIV,
2258,CANTO XIV,
2259,CANTO XIV,
2260,CANTO XIV,
2261,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
2262,CANTO XV,
2263,CANTO XV,
2264,CANTO XV,One of the solid margins bears us now
2265,CANTO XV,"Envelop’d in the mist, that from the stream"
2266,CANTO XV,"Arising, hovers o’er, and saves from fire"
2267,CANTO XV,Both piers and water. As the Flemings rear
2268,CANTO XV,"Their mound, ’twixt Ghent and Bruges, to chase back"
2269,CANTO XV,"The ocean, fearing his tumultuous tide"
2270,CANTO XV,"That drives toward them, or the Paduans theirs"
2271,CANTO XV,"Along the Brenta, to defend their towns"
2272,CANTO XV,"And castles, ere the genial warmth be felt"
2273,CANTO XV,"On Chiarentana’s top; such were the mounds,"
2274,CANTO XV,"So fram’d, though not in height or bulk to these"
2275,CANTO XV,"Made equal, by the master, whosoe’er"
2276,CANTO XV,"He was, that rais’d them here. We from the wood"
2277,CANTO XV,"Were not so far remov’d, that turning round"
2278,CANTO XV,"I might not have discern’d it, when we met"
2279,CANTO XV,"A troop of spirits, who came beside the pier."
2280,CANTO XV,
2281,CANTO XV,"They each one ey’d us, as at eventide"
2282,CANTO XV,"One eyes another under a new moon,"
2283,CANTO XV,"And toward us sharpen’d their sight as keen,"
2284,CANTO XV,As an old tailor at his needle’s eye.
2285,CANTO XV,
2286,CANTO XV,"Thus narrowly explor’d by all the tribe,"
2287,CANTO XV,"I was agniz’d of one, who by the skirt"
2288,CANTO XV,"Caught me, and cried, “What wonder have we here!”"
2289,CANTO XV,
2290,CANTO XV,"And I, when he to me outstretch’d his arm,"
2291,CANTO XV,"Intently fix’d my ken on his parch’d looks,"
2292,CANTO XV,"That although smirch’d with fire, they hinder’d not"
2293,CANTO XV,But I remember’d him; and towards his face
2294,CANTO XV,"My hand inclining, answer’d: “Sir! Brunetto!"
2295,CANTO XV,And art thou here?” He thus to me: “My son!
2296,CANTO XV,"Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto"
2297,CANTO XV,Latini but a little space with thee
2298,CANTO XV,"Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.”"
2299,CANTO XV,
2300,CANTO XV,"I thus to him replied: “Much as I can,"
2301,CANTO XV,"I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,"
2302,CANTO XV,"That I here seat me with thee, I consent;"
2303,CANTO XV,"His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain’d.”"
2304,CANTO XV,
2305,CANTO XV,"“O son!” said he, “ whoever of this throng"
2306,CANTO XV,"One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,"
2307,CANTO XV,"No fan to ventilate him, when the fire"
2308,CANTO XV,Smites sorest. Pass thou therefore on. I close
2309,CANTO XV,"Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin"
2310,CANTO XV,"My troop, who go mourning their endless doom.”"
2311,CANTO XV,
2312,CANTO XV,I dar’d not from the path descend to tread
2313,CANTO XV,"On equal ground with him, but held my head"
2314,CANTO XV,"Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise."
2315,CANTO XV,
2316,CANTO XV,"“What chance or destiny,” thus be began,"
2317,CANTO XV,“Ere the last day conducts thee here below?
2318,CANTO XV,"And who is this, that shows to thee the way?”"
2319,CANTO XV,
2320,CANTO XV,"“There up aloft,” I answer’d, “in the life"
2321,CANTO XV,"Serene, I wander’d in a valley lost,"
2322,CANTO XV,Before mine age had to its fullness reach’d.
2323,CANTO XV,But yester-morn I left it: then once more
2324,CANTO XV,"Into that vale returning, him I met;"
2325,CANTO XV,And by this path homeward he leads me back.”
2326,CANTO XV,
2327,CANTO XV,"“If thou,” he answer’d, “follow but thy star,"
2328,CANTO XV,Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:
2329,CANTO XV,Unless in fairer days my judgment err’d.
2330,CANTO XV,"And if my fate so early had not chanc’d,"
2331,CANTO XV,"Seeing the heav’ns thus bounteous to thee, I"
2332,CANTO XV,Had gladly giv’n thee comfort in thy work.
2333,CANTO XV,"But that ungrateful and malignant race,"
2334,CANTO XV,"Who in old times came down from Fesole,"
2335,CANTO XV,"Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,"
2336,CANTO XV,Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.
2337,CANTO XV,Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour’d crabs
2338,CANTO XV,It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.
2339,CANTO XV,"Old fame reports them in the world for blind,"
2340,CANTO XV,"Covetous, envious, proud. Look to it well:"
2341,CANTO XV,Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways. For thee
2342,CANTO XV,"Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,"
2343,CANTO XV,That thou by either party shalt be crav’d
2344,CANTO XV,With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far
2345,CANTO XV,From the goat’s tooth. The herd of Fesole
2346,CANTO XV,"May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,"
2347,CANTO XV,"If any such yet spring on their rank bed,"
2348,CANTO XV,"In which the holy seed revives, transmitted"
2349,CANTO XV,"From those true Romans, who still there remain’d,"
2350,CANTO XV,When it was made the nest of so much ill.”
2351,CANTO XV,
2352,CANTO XV,"“Were all my wish fulfill’d,” I straight replied,"
2353,CANTO XV,“Thou from the confines of man’s nature yet
2354,CANTO XV,Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind
2355,CANTO XV,"Is fix’d, and now strikes full upon my heart"
2356,CANTO XV,"The dear, benign, paternal image, such"
2357,CANTO XV,"As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me"
2358,CANTO XV,The way for man to win eternity;
2359,CANTO XV,"And how I priz’d the lesson, it behooves,"
2360,CANTO XV,"That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,"
2361,CANTO XV,"What of my fate thou tell’st, that write I down:"
2362,CANTO XV,And with another text to comment on
2363,CANTO XV,"For her I keep it, the celestial dame,"
2364,CANTO XV,"Who will know all, if I to her arrive."
2365,CANTO XV,This only would I have thee clearly note:
2366,CANTO XV,That so my conscience have no plea against me;
2367,CANTO XV,"Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar’d."
2368,CANTO XV,Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.
2369,CANTO XV,"Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,"
2370,CANTO XV,The clown his mattock; all things have their course.”
2371,CANTO XV,
2372,CANTO XV,Thereat my sapient guide upon his right
2373,CANTO XV,"Turn’d himself back, then look’d at me and spake:"
2374,CANTO XV,“He listens to good purpose who takes note.”
2375,CANTO XV,
2376,CANTO XV,"I not the less still on my way proceed,"
2377,CANTO XV,"Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire"
2378,CANTO XV,Who are most known and chief among his tribe.
2379,CANTO XV,
2380,CANTO XV,"“To know of some is well;” thus he replied,"
2381,CANTO XV,“But of the rest silence may best beseem.
2382,CANTO XV,Time would not serve us for report so long.
2383,CANTO XV,"In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,"
2384,CANTO XV,"Men of great learning and no less renown,"
2385,CANTO XV,By one same sin polluted in the world.
2386,CANTO XV,"With them is Priscian, and Accorso’s son"
2387,CANTO XV,Francesco herds among that wretched throng:
2388,CANTO XV,"And, if the wish of so impure a blotch"
2389,CANTO XV,"Possess’d thee, him thou also might’st have seen,"
2390,CANTO XV,Who by the servants’ servant was transferr’d
2391,CANTO XV,"From Arno’s seat to Bacchiglione, where"
2392,CANTO XV,"His ill-strain’d nerves he left. I more would add,"
2393,CANTO XV,But must from farther speech and onward way
2394,CANTO XV,"Alike desist, for yonder I behold"
2395,CANTO XV,A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.
2396,CANTO XV,"A company, with whom I may not sort,"
2397,CANTO XV,"Approaches. I commend my TREASURE to thee,"
2398,CANTO XV,Wherein I yet survive; my sole request.”
2399,CANTO XV,
2400,CANTO XV,"This said he turn’d, and seem’d as one of those,"
2401,CANTO XV,Who o’er Verona’s champain try their speed
2402,CANTO XV,"For the green mantle, and of them he seem’d,"
2403,CANTO XV,Not he who loses but who gains the prize.
2404,CANTO XV,
2405,CANTO XV,
2406,CANTO XV,
2407,CANTO XV,
2408,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
2409,CANTO XVI,
2410,CANTO XVI,
2411,CANTO XVI,"Now came I where the water’s din was heard,"
2412,CANTO XVI,"As down it fell into the other round,"
2413,CANTO XVI,Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:
2414,CANTO XVI,"When forth together issu’d from a troop,"
2415,CANTO XVI,"That pass’d beneath the fierce tormenting storm,"
2416,CANTO XVI,"Three spirits, running swift. They towards us came,"
2417,CANTO XVI,"And each one cried aloud, “Oh do thou stay!"
2418,CANTO XVI,Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem
2419,CANTO XVI,To be some inmate of our evil land.”
2420,CANTO XVI,
2421,CANTO XVI,"Ah me! what wounds I mark’d upon their limbs,"
2422,CANTO XVI,"Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!"
2423,CANTO XVI,E’en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.
2424,CANTO XVI,
2425,CANTO XVI,"Attentive to their cry my teacher paus’d,"
2426,CANTO XVI,"And turn’d to me his visage, and then spake;"
2427,CANTO XVI,“Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:
2428,CANTO XVI,"And were ’t not for the nature of the place,"
2429,CANTO XVI,"Whence glide the fiery darts, I should have said,"
2430,CANTO XVI,That haste had better suited thee than them.”
2431,CANTO XVI,
2432,CANTO XVI,"They, when we stopp’d, resum’d their ancient wail,"
2433,CANTO XVI,"And soon as they had reach’d us, all the three"
2434,CANTO XVI,Whirl’d round together in one restless wheel.
2435,CANTO XVI,"As naked champions, smear’d with slippery oil,"
2436,CANTO XVI,Are wont intent to watch their place of hold
2437,CANTO XVI,"And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;"
2438,CANTO XVI,"Thus each one, as he wheel’d, his countenance"
2439,CANTO XVI,"At me directed, so that opposite"
2440,CANTO XVI,The neck mov’d ever to the twinkling feet.
2441,CANTO XVI,
2442,CANTO XVI,"“If misery of this drear wilderness,”"
2443,CANTO XVI,"Thus one began, “added to our sad cheer"
2444,CANTO XVI,"And destitute, do call forth scorn on us"
2445,CANTO XVI,"And our entreaties, let our great renown"
2446,CANTO XVI,"Incline thee to inform us who thou art,"
2447,CANTO XVI,That dost imprint with living feet unharm’d
2448,CANTO XVI,"The soil of Hell. He, in whose track thou see’st"
2449,CANTO XVI,"My steps pursuing, naked though he be"
2450,CANTO XVI,"And reft of all, was of more high estate"
2451,CANTO XVI,Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste
2452,CANTO XVI,"Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call’d,"
2453,CANTO XVI,Who in his lifetime many a noble act
2454,CANTO XVI,"Achiev’d, both by his wisdom and his sword."
2455,CANTO XVI,"The other, next to me that beats the sand,"
2456,CANTO XVI,"Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,"
2457,CANTO XVI,"In the’ upper world, of honour; and myself"
2458,CANTO XVI,"Who in this torment do partake with them,"
2459,CANTO XVI,"Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife"
2460,CANTO XVI,"Of savage temper, more than aught beside"
2461,CANTO XVI,Hath to this evil brought.” If from the fire
2462,CANTO XVI,"I had been shelter’d, down amidst them straight"
2463,CANTO XVI,"I then had cast me, nor my guide, I deem,"
2464,CANTO XVI,Would have restrain’d my going; but that fear
2465,CANTO XVI,"Of the dire burning vanquish’d the desire,"
2466,CANTO XVI,Which made me eager of their wish’d embrace.
2467,CANTO XVI,
2468,CANTO XVI,"I then began: “Not scorn, but grief much more,"
2469,CANTO XVI,"Such as long time alone can cure, your doom"
2470,CANTO XVI,"Fix’d deep within me, soon as this my lord"
2471,CANTO XVI,"Spake words, whose tenour taught me to expect"
2472,CANTO XVI,"That such a race, as ye are, was at hand."
2473,CANTO XVI,"I am a countryman of yours, who still"
2474,CANTO XVI,"Affectionate have utter’d, and have heard"
2475,CANTO XVI,Your deeds and names renown’d. Leaving the gall
2476,CANTO XVI,"For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide"
2477,CANTO XVI,"Hath promis’d to me. But behooves, that far"
2478,CANTO XVI,As to the centre first I downward tend.”
2479,CANTO XVI,
2480,CANTO XVI,"“So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,”"
2481,CANTO XVI,He answer straight return’d; “and so thy fame
2482,CANTO XVI,"Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,"
2483,CANTO XVI,"If courtesy and valour, as they wont,"
2484,CANTO XVI,"Dwell in our city, or have vanish’d clean?"
2485,CANTO XVI,"For one amidst us late condemn’d to wail,"
2486,CANTO XVI,"Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,"
2487,CANTO XVI,Grieves us no little by the news he brings.”
2488,CANTO XVI,
2489,CANTO XVI,"“An upstart multitude and sudden gains,"
2490,CANTO XVI,"Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee"
2491,CANTO XVI,"Engender’d, so that now in tears thou mourn’st!”"
2492,CANTO XVI,"Thus cried I with my face uprais’d, and they"
2493,CANTO XVI,"All three, who for an answer took my words,"
2494,CANTO XVI,"Look’d at each other, as men look when truth"
2495,CANTO XVI,"Comes to their ear. “If thou at other times,”"
2496,CANTO XVI,"They all at once rejoin’d, “so easily"
2497,CANTO XVI,"Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,"
2498,CANTO XVI,"Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!"
2499,CANTO XVI,"Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,"
2500,CANTO XVI,"Returning to behold the radiant stars,"
2501,CANTO XVI,"When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,"
2502,CANTO XVI,See that of us thou speak among mankind.”
2503,CANTO XVI,
2504,CANTO XVI,"This said, they broke the circle, and so swift"
2505,CANTO XVI,"Fled, that as pinions seem’d their nimble feet."
2506,CANTO XVI,
2507,CANTO XVI,Not in so short a time might one have said
2508,CANTO XVI,"“Amen,” as they had vanish’d. Straight my guide"
2509,CANTO XVI,Pursu’d his track. I follow’d; and small space
2510,CANTO XVI,"Had we pass’d onward, when the water’s sound"
2511,CANTO XVI,"Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce"
2512,CANTO XVI,Heard one another’s speech for the loud din.
2513,CANTO XVI,
2514,CANTO XVI,"E’en as the river, that holds on its course"
2515,CANTO XVI,"Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,"
2516,CANTO XVI,"On the left side of Apennine, toward"
2517,CANTO XVI,"The east, which Acquacheta higher up"
2518,CANTO XVI,"They call, ere it descend into the vale,"
2519,CANTO XVI,"At Forli by that name no longer known,"
2520,CANTO XVI,"Rebellows o’er Saint Benedict, roll’d on"
2521,CANTO XVI,"From the’ Alpine summit down a precipice,"
2522,CANTO XVI,Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;
2523,CANTO XVI,"Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,"
2524,CANTO XVI,"That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,"
2525,CANTO XVI,So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn’d.
2526,CANTO XVI,
2527,CANTO XVI,"I had a cord that brac’d my girdle round,"
2528,CANTO XVI,Wherewith I erst had thought fast bound to take
2529,CANTO XVI,The painted leopard. This when I had all
2530,CANTO XVI,Unloosen’d from me (so my master bade)
2531,CANTO XVI,"I gather’d up, and stretch’d it forth to him."
2532,CANTO XVI,"Then to the right he turn’d, and from the brink"
2533,CANTO XVI,"Standing few paces distant, cast it down"
2534,CANTO XVI,"Into the deep abyss. “And somewhat strange,”"
2535,CANTO XVI,"Thus to myself I spake, “signal so strange"
2536,CANTO XVI,"Betokens, which my guide with earnest eye"
2537,CANTO XVI,Thus follows.” Ah! what caution must men use
2538,CANTO XVI,"With those who look not at the deed alone,"
2539,CANTO XVI,But spy into the thoughts with subtle skill!
2540,CANTO XVI,
2541,CANTO XVI,"“Quickly shall come,” he said, “what I expect,"
2542,CANTO XVI,"Thine eye discover quickly, that whereof"
2543,CANTO XVI,"Thy thought is dreaming.” Ever to that truth,"
2544,CANTO XVI,"Which but the semblance of a falsehood wears,"
2545,CANTO XVI,"A man, if possible, should bar his lip;"
2546,CANTO XVI,"Since, although blameless, he incurs reproach."
2547,CANTO XVI,But silence here were vain; and by these notes
2548,CANTO XVI,"Which now I sing, reader! I swear to thee,"
2549,CANTO XVI,So may they favour find to latest times!
2550,CANTO XVI,That through the gross and murky air I spied
2551,CANTO XVI,"A shape come swimming up, that might have quell’d"
2552,CANTO XVI,"The stoutest heart with wonder, in such guise"
2553,CANTO XVI,"As one returns, who hath been down to loose"
2554,CANTO XVI,"An anchor grappled fast against some rock,"
2555,CANTO XVI,"Or to aught else that in the salt wave lies,"
2556,CANTO XVI,Who upward springing close draws in his feet.
2557,CANTO XVI,
2558,CANTO XVI,
2559,CANTO XVI,
2560,CANTO XVI,
2561,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
2562,CANTO XVII,
2563,CANTO XVII,
2564,CANTO XVII,“Lo! the fell monster with the deadly sting!
2565,CANTO XVII,"Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls"
2566,CANTO XVII,"And firm embattled spears, and with his filth"
2567,CANTO XVII,"Taints all the world!” Thus me my guide address’d,"
2568,CANTO XVII,"And beckon’d him, that he should come to shore,"
2569,CANTO XVII,Near to the stony causeway’s utmost edge.
2570,CANTO XVII,
2571,CANTO XVII,"Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear’d,"
2572,CANTO XVII,"His head and upper part expos’d on land,"
2573,CANTO XVII,But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
2574,CANTO XVII,"His face the semblance of a just man’s wore,"
2575,CANTO XVII,So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
2576,CANTO XVII,The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
2577,CANTO XVII,"Reach’d to the armpits, and the back and breast,"
2578,CANTO XVII,"And either side, were painted o’er with nodes"
2579,CANTO XVII,And orbits. Colours variegated more
2580,CANTO XVII,Nor Turks nor Tartars e’er on cloth of state
2581,CANTO XVII,"With interchangeable embroidery wove,"
2582,CANTO XVII,Nor spread Arachne o’er her curious loom.
2583,CANTO XVII,"As ofttimes a light skiff, moor’d to the shore,"
2584,CANTO XVII,"Stands part in water, part upon the land;"
2585,CANTO XVII,"Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,"
2586,CANTO XVII,The beaver settles watching for his prey;
2587,CANTO XVII,"So on the rim, that fenc’d the sand with rock,"
2588,CANTO XVII,Sat perch’d the fiend of evil. In the void
2589,CANTO XVII,"Glancing, his tail upturn’d its venomous fork,"
2590,CANTO XVII,With sting like scorpion’s arm’d. Then thus my guide:
2591,CANTO XVII,"“Now need our way must turn few steps apart,"
2592,CANTO XVII,"Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.”"
2593,CANTO XVII,
2594,CANTO XVII,Thereat toward the right our downward course
2595,CANTO XVII,"We shap’d, and, better to escape the flame"
2596,CANTO XVII,"And burning marle, ten paces on the verge"
2597,CANTO XVII,"Proceeded. Soon as we to him arrive,"
2598,CANTO XVII,A little further on mine eye beholds
2599,CANTO XVII,"A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand"
2600,CANTO XVII,Near the wide chasm. Forthwith my master spake:
2601,CANTO XVII,“That to the full thy knowledge may extend
2602,CANTO XVII,"Of all this round contains, go now, and mark"
2603,CANTO XVII,The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.
2604,CANTO XVII,"Till thou returnest, I with him meantime"
2605,CANTO XVII,"Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe"
2606,CANTO XVII,The aid of his strong shoulders.” Thus alone
2607,CANTO XVII,Yet forward on the’ extremity I pac’d
2608,CANTO XVII,"Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe"
2609,CANTO XVII,Were seated. At the eyes forth gush’d their pangs.
2610,CANTO XVII,Against the vapours and the torrid soil
2611,CANTO XVII,Alternately their shifting hands they plied.
2612,CANTO XVII,Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply
2613,CANTO XVII,"Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore"
2614,CANTO XVII,"By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round."
2615,CANTO XVII,
2616,CANTO XVII,"Noting the visages of some, who lay"
2617,CANTO XVII,"Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,"
2618,CANTO XVII,"One of them all I knew not; but perceiv’d,"
2619,CANTO XVII,That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch
2620,CANTO XVII,"With colours and with emblems various mark’d,"
2621,CANTO XVII,On which it seem’d as if their eye did feed.
2622,CANTO XVII,
2623,CANTO XVII,"And when amongst them looking round I came,"
2624,CANTO XVII,"A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,"
2625,CANTO XVII,That wore a lion’s countenance and port.
2626,CANTO XVII,"Then still my sight pursuing its career,"
2627,CANTO XVII,"Another I beheld, than blood more red."
2628,CANTO XVII,A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
2629,CANTO XVII,"And one, who bore a fat and azure swine"
2630,CANTO XVII,"Pictur’d on his white scrip, addressed me thus:"
2631,CANTO XVII,"“What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know,"
2632,CANTO XVII,"Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here"
2633,CANTO XVII,Vitaliano on my left shall sit.
2634,CANTO XVII,A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
2635,CANTO XVII,"Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming"
2636,CANTO XVII,“O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch
2637,CANTO XVII,"With the three beaks will bring!” This said, he writh’d"
2638,CANTO XVII,"The mouth, and loll’d the tongue out, like an ox"
2639,CANTO XVII,"That licks his nostrils. I, lest longer stay"
2640,CANTO XVII,"He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,"
2641,CANTO XVII,Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn’d.
2642,CANTO XVII,
2643,CANTO XVII,My guide already seated on the haunch
2644,CANTO XVII,Of the fierce animal I found; and thus
2645,CANTO XVII,He me encourag’d. “Be thou stout; be bold.
2646,CANTO XVII,Down such a steep flight must we now descend!
2647,CANTO XVII,Mount thou before: for that no power the tail
2648,CANTO XVII,"May have to harm thee, I will be i’ th’ midst.”"
2649,CANTO XVII,
2650,CANTO XVII,"As one, who hath an ague fit so near,"
2651,CANTO XVII,"His nails already are turn’d blue, and he"
2652,CANTO XVII,"Quivers all o’er, if he but eye the shade;"
2653,CANTO XVII,Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.
2654,CANTO XVII,"But shame soon interpos’d her threat, who makes"
2655,CANTO XVII,The servant bold in presence of his lord.
2656,CANTO XVII,
2657,CANTO XVII,"I settled me upon those shoulders huge,"
2658,CANTO XVII,"And would have said, but that the words to aid"
2659,CANTO XVII,"My purpose came not, “Look thou clasp me firm!”"
2660,CANTO XVII,
2661,CANTO XVII,"But he whose succour then not first I prov’d,"
2662,CANTO XVII,"Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,"
2663,CANTO XVII,"Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:"
2664,CANTO XVII,“Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres
2665,CANTO XVII,"Of ample circuit, easy thy descent."
2666,CANTO XVII,Think on th’ unusual burden thou sustain’st.”
2667,CANTO XVII,
2668,CANTO XVII,"As a small vessel, back’ning out from land,"
2669,CANTO XVII,"Her station quits; so thence the monster loos’d,"
2670,CANTO XVII,"And when he felt himself at large, turn’d round"
2671,CANTO XVII,"There where the breast had been, his forked tail."
2672,CANTO XVII,"Thus, like an eel, outstretch’d at length he steer’d,"
2673,CANTO XVII,Gath’ring the air up with retractile claws.
2674,CANTO XVII,
2675,CANTO XVII,Not greater was the dread when Phaeton
2676,CANTO XVII,"The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,"
2677,CANTO XVII,"Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;"
2678,CANTO XVII,"Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv’d,"
2679,CANTO XVII,"By liquefaction of the scalded wax,"
2680,CANTO XVII,"The trusted pennons loosen’d from his loins,"
2681,CANTO XVII,"His sire exclaiming loud, “Ill way thou keep’st!”"
2682,CANTO XVII,"Than was my dread, when round me on each part"
2683,CANTO XVII,"The air I view’d, and other object none"
2684,CANTO XVII,"Save the fell beast. He slowly sailing, wheels"
2685,CANTO XVII,"His downward motion, unobserv’d of me,"
2686,CANTO XVII,"But that the wind, arising to my face,"
2687,CANTO XVII,Breathes on me from below. Now on our right
2688,CANTO XVII,I heard the cataract beneath us leap
2689,CANTO XVII,"With hideous crash; whence bending down to’ explore,"
2690,CANTO XVII,New terror I conceiv’d at the steep plunge:
2691,CANTO XVII,"For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:"
2692,CANTO XVII,"So that all trembling close I crouch’d my limbs,"
2693,CANTO XVII,"And then distinguish’d, unperceiv’d before,"
2694,CANTO XVII,By the dread torments that on every side
2695,CANTO XVII,"Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound."
2696,CANTO XVII,
2697,CANTO XVII,"As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,"
2698,CANTO XVII,"But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair"
2699,CANTO XVII,"The falconer cries, “Ah me! thou stoop’st to earth!”"
2700,CANTO XVII,"Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky"
2701,CANTO XVII,"In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits"
2702,CANTO XVII,At distance from his lord in angry mood;
2703,CANTO XVII,So Geryon lighting places us on foot
2704,CANTO XVII,"Low down at base of the deep-furrow’d rock,"
2705,CANTO XVII,"And, of his burden there discharg’d, forthwith"
2706,CANTO XVII,"Sprang forward, like an arrow from the string."
2707,CANTO XVII,
2708,CANTO XVII,
2709,CANTO XVII,
2710,CANTO XVII,
2711,CANTO XVIII,CANTO XVIII
2712,CANTO XVIII,
2713,CANTO XVIII,
2714,CANTO XVIII,There is a place within the depths of hell
2715,CANTO XVIII,"Call’d Malebolge, all of rock dark-stain’d"
2716,CANTO XVIII,"With hue ferruginous, e’en as the steep"
2717,CANTO XVIII,That round it circling winds. Right in the midst
2718,CANTO XVIII,"Of that abominable region, yawns"
2719,CANTO XVIII,"A spacious gulf profound, whereof the frame"
2720,CANTO XVIII,"Due time shall tell. The circle, that remains,"
2721,CANTO XVIII,"Throughout its round, between the gulf and base"
2722,CANTO XVIII,"Of the high craggy banks, successive forms"
2723,CANTO XVIII,"Ten trenches, in its hollow bottom sunk."
2724,CANTO XVIII,
2725,CANTO XVIII,"As where to guard the walls, full many a foss"
2726,CANTO XVIII,"Begirds some stately castle, sure defence"
2727,CANTO XVIII,"Affording to the space within, so here"
2728,CANTO XVIII,Were model’d these; and as like fortresses
2729,CANTO XVIII,"E’en from their threshold to the brink without,"
2730,CANTO XVIII,Are flank’d with bridges; from the rock’s low base
2731,CANTO XVIII,"Thus flinty paths advanc’d, that ’cross the moles"
2732,CANTO XVIII,"And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,"
2733,CANTO XVIII,That in one bound collected cuts them off.
2734,CANTO XVIII,"Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves"
2735,CANTO XVIII,From Geryon’s back dislodg’d. The bard to left
2736,CANTO XVIII,"Held on his way, and I behind him mov’d."
2737,CANTO XVIII,
2738,CANTO XVIII,"On our right hand new misery I saw,"
2739,CANTO XVIII,"New pains, new executioners of wrath,"
2740,CANTO XVIII,That swarming peopled the first chasm. Below
2741,CANTO XVIII,"Were naked sinners. Hitherward they came,"
2742,CANTO XVIII,"Meeting our faces from the middle point,"
2743,CANTO XVIII,With us beyond but with a larger stride.
2744,CANTO XVIII,"E’en thus the Romans, when the year returns"
2745,CANTO XVIII,"Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid"
2746,CANTO XVIII,"The thronging multitudes, their means devise"
2747,CANTO XVIII,For such as pass the bridge; that on one side
2748,CANTO XVIII,"All front toward the castle, and approach"
2749,CANTO XVIII,"Saint Peter’s fane, on th’ other towards the mount."
2750,CANTO XVIII,
2751,CANTO XVIII,"Each divers way along the grisly rock,"
2752,CANTO XVIII,"Horn’d demons I beheld, with lashes huge,"
2753,CANTO XVIII,That on their back unmercifully smote.
2754,CANTO XVIII,Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!
2755,CANTO XVIII,None for the second waited nor the third.
2756,CANTO XVIII,
2757,CANTO XVIII,"Meantime as on I pass’d, one met my sight"
2758,CANTO XVIII,"Whom soon as view’d; “Of him,” cried I, “not yet"
2759,CANTO XVIII,Mine eye hath had his fill.” With fixed gaze
2760,CANTO XVIII,I therefore scann’d him. Straight the teacher kind
2761,CANTO XVIII,"Paus’d with me, and consented I should walk"
2762,CANTO XVIII,"Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,"
2763,CANTO XVIII,"Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down."
2764,CANTO XVIII,But it avail’d him nought; for I exclaim’d:
2765,CANTO XVIII,"“Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,"
2766,CANTO XVIII,"Unless thy features do belie thee much,"
2767,CANTO XVIII,Venedico art thou. But what brings thee
2768,CANTO XVIII,Into this bitter seas’ning? “ He replied:
2769,CANTO XVIII,“Unwillingly I answer to thy words.
2770,CANTO XVIII,"But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls"
2771,CANTO XVIII,"The world I once inhabited, constrains me."
2772,CANTO XVIII,Know then ’twas I who led fair Ghisola
2773,CANTO XVIII,"To do the Marquis’ will, however fame"
2774,CANTO XVIII,The shameful tale have bruited. Nor alone
2775,CANTO XVIII,Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn
2776,CANTO XVIII,Rather with us the place is so o’erthrong’d
2777,CANTO XVIII,"That not so many tongues this day are taught,"
2778,CANTO XVIII,"Betwixt the Reno and Savena’s stream,"
2779,CANTO XVIII,To answer SIPA in their country’s phrase.
2780,CANTO XVIII,"And if of that securer proof thou need,"
2781,CANTO XVIII,Remember but our craving thirst for gold.”
2782,CANTO XVIII,
2783,CANTO XVIII,"Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong"
2784,CANTO XVIII,"Struck, and exclaim’d, “Away! corrupter! here"
2785,CANTO XVIII,Women are none for sale.” Forthwith I join’d
2786,CANTO XVIII,"My escort, and few paces thence we came"
2787,CANTO XVIII,To where a rock forth issued from the bank.
2788,CANTO XVIII,"That easily ascended, to the right"
2789,CANTO XVIII,"Upon its splinter turning, we depart"
2790,CANTO XVIII,"From those eternal barriers. When arriv’d,"
2791,CANTO XVIII,Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass
2792,CANTO XVIII,"The scourged souls: “Pause here,” the teacher said,"
2793,CANTO XVIII,"“And let these others miserable, now"
2794,CANTO XVIII,"Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,"
2795,CANTO XVIII,For that together they with us have walk’d.”
2796,CANTO XVIII,
2797,CANTO XVIII,"From the old bridge we ey’d the pack, who came"
2798,CANTO XVIII,"From th’ other side towards us, like the rest,"
2799,CANTO XVIII,"Excoriate from the lash. My gentle guide,"
2800,CANTO XVIII,"By me unquestion’d, thus his speech resum’d:"
2801,CANTO XVIII,"“Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,"
2802,CANTO XVIII,And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.
2803,CANTO XVIII,How yet the regal aspect he retains!
2804,CANTO XVIII,"Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won"
2805,CANTO XVIII,The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle
2806,CANTO XVIII,"His passage thither led him, when those bold"
2807,CANTO XVIII,And pitiless women had slain all their males.
2808,CANTO XVIII,There he with tokens and fair witching words
2809,CANTO XVIII,"Hypsipyle beguil’d, a virgin young,"
2810,CANTO XVIII,Who first had all the rest herself beguil’d.
2811,CANTO XVIII,Impregnated he left her there forlorn.
2812,CANTO XVIII,Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.
2813,CANTO XVIII,Here too Medea’s inj’ries are avenged.
2814,CANTO XVIII,"All bear him company, who like deceit"
2815,CANTO XVIII,To his have practis’d. And thus much to know
2816,CANTO XVIII,"Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those"
2817,CANTO XVIII,Whom its keen torments urge.” Now had we come
2818,CANTO XVIII,"Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten’d path"
2819,CANTO XVIII,Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.
2820,CANTO XVIII,
2821,CANTO XVIII,"Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,"
2822,CANTO XVIII,"Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,"
2823,CANTO XVIII,"With wide-stretch’d nostrils snort, and on themselves"
2824,CANTO XVIII,Smite with their palms. Upon the banks a scurf
2825,CANTO XVIII,"From the foul steam condens’d, encrusting hung,"
2826,CANTO XVIII,That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.
2827,CANTO XVIII,
2828,CANTO XVIII,"So hollow is the depth, that from no part,"
2829,CANTO XVIII,"Save on the summit of the rocky span,"
2830,CANTO XVIII,Could I distinguish aught. Thus far we came;
2831,CANTO XVIII,"And thence I saw, within the foss below,"
2832,CANTO XVIII,"A crowd immers’d in ordure, that appear’d"
2833,CANTO XVIII,Draff of the human body. There beneath
2834,CANTO XVIII,"Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark’d"
2835,CANTO XVIII,"One with his head so grim’d, ’twere hard to deem,"
2836,CANTO XVIII,If he were clerk or layman. Loud he cried:
2837,CANTO XVIII,"“Why greedily thus bendest more on me,"
2838,CANTO XVIII,"Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?”"
2839,CANTO XVIII,
2840,CANTO XVIII,"“Because if true my mem’ry,” I replied,"
2841,CANTO XVIII,"“I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,"
2842,CANTO XVIII,And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.
2843,CANTO XVIII,Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.”
2844,CANTO XVIII,
2845,CANTO XVIII,Then beating on his brain these words he spake:
2846,CANTO XVIII,"“Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,"
2847,CANTO XVIII,Wherewith I ne’er enough could glut my tongue.”
2848,CANTO XVIII,
2849,CANTO XVIII,My leader thus: “A little further stretch
2850,CANTO XVIII,"Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note"
2851,CANTO XVIII,"Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,"
2852,CANTO XVIII,"Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,"
2853,CANTO XVIII,"Now crouching down, now risen on her feet."
2854,CANTO XVIII,"Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip"
2855,CANTO XVIII,"Answer’d her doting paramour that ask’d,"
2856,CANTO XVIII,"‘Thankest me much!’—‘Say rather wondrously,’"
2857,CANTO XVIII,And seeing this here satiate be our view.”
2858,CANTO XVIII,
2859,CANTO XVIII,
2860,CANTO XVIII,
2861,CANTO XVIII,
2862,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
2863,CANTO XIX,
2864,CANTO XIX,
2865,CANTO XIX,"Woe to thee, Simon Magus! woe to you,"
2866,CANTO XIX,"His wretched followers! who the things of God,"
2867,CANTO XIX,"Which should be wedded unto goodness, them,"
2868,CANTO XIX,"Rapacious as ye are, do prostitute"
2869,CANTO XIX,For gold and silver in adultery!
2870,CANTO XIX,"Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours"
2871,CANTO XIX,Is the third chasm. Upon the following vault
2872,CANTO XIX,"We now had mounted, where the rock impends"
2873,CANTO XIX,Directly o’er the centre of the foss.
2874,CANTO XIX,
2875,CANTO XIX,"Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,"
2876,CANTO XIX,"Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,"
2877,CANTO XIX,"And in the evil world, how just a meed"
2878,CANTO XIX,Allotting by thy virtue unto all!
2879,CANTO XIX,
2880,CANTO XIX,"I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides"
2881,CANTO XIX,"And in its bottom full of apertures,"
2882,CANTO XIX,"All equal in their width, and circular each,"
2883,CANTO XIX,Nor ample less nor larger they appear’d
2884,CANTO XIX,Than in Saint John’s fair dome of me belov’d
2885,CANTO XIX,"Those fram’d to hold the pure baptismal streams,"
2886,CANTO XIX,"One of the which I brake, some few years past,"
2887,CANTO XIX,To save a whelming infant; and be this
2888,CANTO XIX,A seal to undeceive whoever doubts
2889,CANTO XIX,The motive of my deed. From out the mouth
2890,CANTO XIX,"Of every one, emerg’d a sinner’s feet"
2891,CANTO XIX,And of the legs high upward as the calf
2892,CANTO XIX,The rest beneath was hid. On either foot
2893,CANTO XIX,"The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints"
2894,CANTO XIX,"Glanc’d with such violent motion, as had snapt"
2895,CANTO XIX,"Asunder cords or twisted withs. As flame,"
2896,CANTO XIX,"Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along"
2897,CANTO XIX,"The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;"
2898,CANTO XIX,"So here, from heel to point, glided the flames."
2899,CANTO XIX,
2900,CANTO XIX,"“Master! say who is he, than all the rest"
2901,CANTO XIX,"Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom"
2902,CANTO XIX,A ruddier flame doth prey?” I thus inquir’d.
2903,CANTO XIX,
2904,CANTO XIX,"“If thou be willing,” he replied, “that I"
2905,CANTO XIX,"Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,"
2906,CANTO XIX,He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.”
2907,CANTO XIX,
2908,CANTO XIX,I then: “As pleases thee to me is best.
2909,CANTO XIX,Thou art my lord; and know’st that ne’er I quit
2910,CANTO XIX,Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.”
2911,CANTO XIX,"Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn’d,"
2912,CANTO XIX,"And on our left descended to the depth,"
2913,CANTO XIX,A narrow strait and perforated close.
2914,CANTO XIX,"Nor from his side my leader set me down,"
2915,CANTO XIX,"Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb"
2916,CANTO XIX,"Quiv’ring express’d his pang. “Whoe’er thou art,"
2917,CANTO XIX,"Sad spirit! thus revers’d, and as a stake"
2918,CANTO XIX,"Driv’n in the soil!” I in these words began,"
2919,CANTO XIX,"“If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.”"
2920,CANTO XIX,
2921,CANTO XIX,"There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive"
2922,CANTO XIX,"A wretch for murder doom’d, who e’en when fix’d,"
2923,CANTO XIX,"Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays."
2924,CANTO XIX,
2925,CANTO XIX,He shouted: “Ha! already standest there?
2926,CANTO XIX,"Already standest there, O Boniface!"
2927,CANTO XIX,By many a year the writing play’d me false.
2928,CANTO XIX,"So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,"
2929,CANTO XIX,For which thou fearedst not in guile to take
2930,CANTO XIX,"The lovely lady, and then mangle her?”"
2931,CANTO XIX,
2932,CANTO XIX,"I felt as those who, piercing not the drift"
2933,CANTO XIX,"Of answer made them, stand as if expos’d"
2934,CANTO XIX,"In mockery, nor know what to reply,"
2935,CANTO XIX,"When Virgil thus admonish’d: “Tell him quick,"
2936,CANTO XIX,"I am not he, not he, whom thou believ’st.”"
2937,CANTO XIX,
2938,CANTO XIX,"And I, as was enjoin’d me, straight replied."
2939,CANTO XIX,
2940,CANTO XIX,"That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,"
2941,CANTO XIX,And sighing next in woeful accent spake:
2942,CANTO XIX,“What then of me requirest?” If to know
2943,CANTO XIX,"So much imports thee, who I am, that thou"
2944,CANTO XIX,"Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn"
2945,CANTO XIX,"That in the mighty mantle I was rob’d,"
2946,CANTO XIX,"And of a she-bear was indeed the son,"
2947,CANTO XIX,"So eager to advance my whelps, that there"
2948,CANTO XIX,"My having in my purse above I stow’d,"
2949,CANTO XIX,And here myself. Under my head are dragg’d
2950,CANTO XIX,"The rest, my predecessors in the guilt"
2951,CANTO XIX,Of simony. Stretch’d at their length they lie
2952,CANTO XIX,Along an opening in the rock. ’Midst them
2953,CANTO XIX,"I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,"
2954,CANTO XIX,"For whom I took thee, when so hastily"
2955,CANTO XIX,I question’d. But already longer time
2956,CANTO XIX,"Hath pass’d, since my souls kindled, and I thus"
2957,CANTO XIX,"Upturn’d have stood, than is his doom to stand"
2958,CANTO XIX,"Planted with fiery feet. For after him,"
2959,CANTO XIX,"One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,"
2960,CANTO XIX,"From forth the west, a shepherd without law,"
2961,CANTO XIX,Fated to cover both his form and mine.
2962,CANTO XIX,"He a new Jason shall be call’d, of whom"
2963,CANTO XIX,In Maccabees we read; and favour such
2964,CANTO XIX,"As to that priest his king indulgent show’d,"
2965,CANTO XIX,Shall be of France’s monarch shown to him.”
2966,CANTO XIX,
2967,CANTO XIX,"I know not if I here too far presum’d,"
2968,CANTO XIX,"But in this strain I answer’d: “Tell me now,"
2969,CANTO XIX,What treasures from St. Peter at the first
2970,CANTO XIX,"Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys"
2971,CANTO XIX,Into his charge? Surely he ask’d no more
2972,CANTO XIX,"But, Follow me! Nor Peter nor the rest"
2973,CANTO XIX,"Or gold or silver of Matthias took,"
2974,CANTO XIX,When lots were cast upon the forfeit place
2975,CANTO XIX,Of the condemned soul. Abide thou then;
2976,CANTO XIX,Thy punishment of right is merited:
2977,CANTO XIX,"And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,"
2978,CANTO XIX,Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir’d.
2979,CANTO XIX,"If reverence of the keys restrain’d me not,"
2980,CANTO XIX,"Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet"
2981,CANTO XIX,Severer speech might use. Your avarice
2982,CANTO XIX,"O’ercasts the world with mourning, under foot"
2983,CANTO XIX,"Treading the good, and raising bad men up."
2984,CANTO XIX,"Of shepherds, like to you, th’ Evangelist"
2985,CANTO XIX,"Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,"
2986,CANTO XIX,"With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,"
2987,CANTO XIX,"She who with seven heads tower’d at her birth,"
2988,CANTO XIX,"And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,"
2989,CANTO XIX,Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.
2990,CANTO XIX,"Of gold and silver ye have made your god,"
2991,CANTO XIX,"Diff’ring wherein from the idolater,"
2992,CANTO XIX,"But he that worships one, a hundred ye?"
2993,CANTO XIX,"Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,"
2994,CANTO XIX,"Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,"
2995,CANTO XIX,Which the first wealthy Father gain’d from thee!”
2996,CANTO XIX,
2997,CANTO XIX,"Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath"
2998,CANTO XIX,"Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang"
2999,CANTO XIX,Spinning on either sole. I do believe
3000,CANTO XIX,"My teacher well was pleas’d, with so compos’d"
3001,CANTO XIX,"A lip, he listen’d ever to the sound"
3002,CANTO XIX,Of the true words I utter’d. In both arms
3003,CANTO XIX,"He caught, and to his bosom lifting me"
3004,CANTO XIX,Upward retrac’d the way of his descent.
3005,CANTO XIX,
3006,CANTO XIX,"Nor weary of his weight he press’d me close,"
3007,CANTO XIX,"Till to the summit of the rock we came,"
3008,CANTO XIX,Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.
3009,CANTO XIX,His cherish’d burden there gently he plac’d
3010,CANTO XIX,"Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path"
3011,CANTO XIX,Not easy for the clamb’ring goat to mount.
3012,CANTO XIX,
3013,CANTO XIX,Thence to my view another vale appear’d
3014,CANTO XIX,
3015,CANTO XIX,
3016,CANTO XIX,
3017,CANTO XIX,
3018,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
3019,CANTO XX,
3020,CANTO XX,
3021,CANTO XX,"And now the verse proceeds to torments new,"
3022,CANTO XX,Fit argument of this the twentieth strain
3023,CANTO XX,"Of the first song, whose awful theme records"
3024,CANTO XX,The spirits whelm’d in woe. Earnest I look’d
3025,CANTO XX,"Into the depth, that open’d to my view,"
3026,CANTO XX,"Moisten’d with tears of anguish, and beheld"
3027,CANTO XX,"A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,"
3028,CANTO XX,In silence weeping: such their step as walk
3029,CANTO XX,Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.
3030,CANTO XX,
3031,CANTO XX,"As on them more direct mine eye descends,"
3032,CANTO XX,Each wondrously seem’d to be revers’d
3033,CANTO XX,"At the neck-bone, so that the countenance"
3034,CANTO XX,Was from the reins averted: and because
3035,CANTO XX,"None might before him look, they were compell’d"
3036,CANTO XX,To’ advance with backward gait. Thus one perhaps
3037,CANTO XX,"Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos’d,"
3038,CANTO XX,But I ne’er saw it nor believe it so.
3039,CANTO XX,
3040,CANTO XX,"Now, reader! think within thyself, so God"
3041,CANTO XX,Fruit of thy reading give thee! how I long
3042,CANTO XX,"Could keep my visage dry, when I beheld"
3043,CANTO XX,"Near me our form distorted in such guise,"
3044,CANTO XX,That on the hinder parts fall’n from the face
3045,CANTO XX,The tears down-streaming roll’d. Against a rock
3046,CANTO XX,"I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim’d:"
3047,CANTO XX,"“What, and art thou too witless as the rest?"
3048,CANTO XX,"Here pity most doth show herself alive,"
3049,CANTO XX,"When she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his,"
3050,CANTO XX,Who with Heaven’s judgment in his passion strives?
3051,CANTO XX,"Raise up thy head, raise up, and see the man,"
3052,CANTO XX,"Before whose eyes earth gap’d in Thebes, when all"
3053,CANTO XX,"Cried out, ‘Amphiaraus, whither rushest?"
3054,CANTO XX,‘Why leavest thou the war?’ He not the less
3055,CANTO XX,"Fell ruining far as to Minos down,"
3056,CANTO XX,Whose grapple none eludes. Lo! how he makes
3057,CANTO XX,"The breast his shoulders, and who once too far"
3058,CANTO XX,"Before him wish’d to see, now backward looks,"
3059,CANTO XX,"And treads reverse his path. Tiresias note,"
3060,CANTO XX,"Who semblance chang’d, when woman he became"
3061,CANTO XX,"Of male, through every limb transform’d, and then"
3062,CANTO XX,Once more behov’d him with his rod to strike
3063,CANTO XX,"The two entwining serpents, ere the plumes,"
3064,CANTO XX,"That mark’d the better sex, might shoot again."
3065,CANTO XX,
3066,CANTO XX,"“Aruns, with rere his belly facing, comes."
3067,CANTO XX,"On Luni’s mountains ’midst the marbles white,"
3068,CANTO XX,"Where delves Carrara’s hind, who wons beneath,"
3069,CANTO XX,"A cavern was his dwelling, whence the stars"
3070,CANTO XX,And main-sea wide in boundless view he held.
3071,CANTO XX,
3072,CANTO XX,"“The next, whose loosen’d tresses overspread"
3073,CANTO XX,"Her bosom, which thou seest not (for each hair"
3074,CANTO XX,"On that side grows) was Manto, she who search’d"
3075,CANTO XX,"Through many regions, and at length her seat"
3076,CANTO XX,"Fix’d in my native land, whence a short space"
3077,CANTO XX,My words detain thy audience. When her sire
3078,CANTO XX,"From life departed, and in servitude"
3079,CANTO XX,"The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn’d,"
3080,CANTO XX,Long time she went a wand’rer through the world.
3081,CANTO XX,Aloft in Italy’s delightful land
3082,CANTO XX,"A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,"
3083,CANTO XX,"That o’er the Tyrol locks Germania in,"
3084,CANTO XX,"Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,"
3085,CANTO XX,"Methinks, and more, water between the vale"
3086,CANTO XX,Camonica and Garda and the height
3087,CANTO XX,Of Apennine remote. There is a spot
3088,CANTO XX,"At midway of that lake, where he who bears"
3089,CANTO XX,"Of Trento’s flock the past’ral staff, with him"
3090,CANTO XX,"Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each"
3091,CANTO XX,Passing that way his benediction give.
3092,CANTO XX,A garrison of goodly site and strong
3093,CANTO XX,"Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos’d"
3094,CANTO XX,"The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore"
3095,CANTO XX,"More slope each way descends. There, whatsoev’er"
3096,CANTO XX,"Benacus’ bosom holds not, tumbling o’er"
3097,CANTO XX,"Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath"
3098,CANTO XX,Through the green pastures. Soon as in his course
3099,CANTO XX,"The steam makes head, Benacus then no more"
3100,CANTO XX,"They call the name, but Mincius, till at last"
3101,CANTO XX,Reaching Governo into Po he falls.
3102,CANTO XX,"Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat"
3103,CANTO XX,"It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh"
3104,CANTO XX,"It covers, pestilent in summer oft."
3105,CANTO XX,"Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw"
3106,CANTO XX,’Midst of the fen a territory waste
3107,CANTO XX,And naked of inhabitants. To shun
3108,CANTO XX,"All human converse, here she with her slaves"
3109,CANTO XX,"Plying her arts remain’d, and liv’d, and left"
3110,CANTO XX,"Her body tenantless. Thenceforth the tribes,"
3111,CANTO XX,"Who round were scatter’d, gath’ring to that place"
3112,CANTO XX,"Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos’d"
3113,CANTO XX,On all parts by the fen. On those dead bones
3114,CANTO XX,"They rear’d themselves a city, for her sake,"
3115,CANTO XX,"Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,"
3116,CANTO XX,"Nor ask’d another omen for the name,"
3117,CANTO XX,"Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,"
3118,CANTO XX,Ere Casalodi’s madness by deceit
3119,CANTO XX,Was wrong’d of Pinamonte. If thou hear
3120,CANTO XX,Henceforth another origin assign’d
3121,CANTO XX,"Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,"
3122,CANTO XX,That falsehood none beguile thee of the truth.”
3123,CANTO XX,
3124,CANTO XX,"I answer’d: “Teacher, I conclude thy words"
3125,CANTO XX,"So certain, that all else shall be to me"
3126,CANTO XX,"As embers lacking life. But now of these,"
3127,CANTO XX,"Who here proceed, instruct me, if thou see"
3128,CANTO XX,Any that merit more especial note.
3129,CANTO XX,For thereon is my mind alone intent.”
3130,CANTO XX,
3131,CANTO XX,"He straight replied: “That spirit, from whose cheek"
3132,CANTO XX,"The beard sweeps o’er his shoulders brown, what time"
3133,CANTO XX,"Graecia was emptied of her males, that scarce"
3134,CANTO XX,"The cradles were supplied, the seer was he"
3135,CANTO XX,"In Aulis, who with Calchas gave the sign"
3136,CANTO XX,When first to cut the cable. Him they nam’d
3137,CANTO XX,"Eurypilus: so sings my tragic strain,"
3138,CANTO XX,"In which majestic measure well thou know’st,"
3139,CANTO XX,"Who know’st it all. That other, round the loins"
3140,CANTO XX,"So slender of his shape, was Michael Scot,"
3141,CANTO XX,Practis’d in ev’ry slight of magic wile.
3142,CANTO XX,
3143,CANTO XX,"“Guido Bonatti see: Asdente mark,"
3144,CANTO XX,"Who now were willing, he had tended still"
3145,CANTO XX,The thread and cordwain; and too late repents.
3146,CANTO XX,
3147,CANTO XX,"“See next the wretches, who the needle left,"
3148,CANTO XX,"The shuttle and the spindle, and became"
3149,CANTO XX,Diviners: baneful witcheries they wrought
3150,CANTO XX,With images and herbs. But onward now:
3151,CANTO XX,For now doth Cain with fork of thorns confine
3152,CANTO XX,"On either hemisphere, touching the wave"
3153,CANTO XX,Beneath the towers of Seville. Yesternight
3154,CANTO XX,The moon was round. Thou mayst remember well:
3155,CANTO XX,For she good service did thee in the gloom
3156,CANTO XX,"Of the deep wood.” This said, both onward mov’d."
3157,CANTO XX,
3158,CANTO XX,
3159,CANTO XX,
3160,CANTO XX,
3161,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
3162,CANTO XXI,
3163,CANTO XXI,
3164,CANTO XXI,"Thus we from bridge to bridge, with other talk,"
3165,CANTO XXI,"The which my drama cares not to rehearse,"
3166,CANTO XXI,"Pass’d on; and to the summit reaching, stood"
3167,CANTO XXI,"To view another gap, within the round"
3168,CANTO XXI,"Of Malebolge, other bootless pangs."
3169,CANTO XXI,
3170,CANTO XXI,Marvelous darkness shadow’d o’er the place.
3171,CANTO XXI,
3172,CANTO XXI,In the Venetians’ arsenal as boils
3173,CANTO XXI,"Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear"
3174,CANTO XXI,Their unsound vessels; for th’ inclement time
3175,CANTO XXI,"Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while"
3176,CANTO XXI,"His bark one builds anew, another stops"
3177,CANTO XXI,"The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;"
3178,CANTO XXI,"One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;"
3179,CANTO XXI,"This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,"
3180,CANTO XXI,The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent
3181,CANTO XXI,So not by force of fire but art divine
3182,CANTO XXI,"Boil’d here a glutinous thick mass, that round"
3183,CANTO XXI,"Lim’d all the shore beneath. I that beheld,"
3184,CANTO XXI,"But therein nought distinguish’d, save the surge,"
3185,CANTO XXI,"Rais’d by the boiling, in one mighty swell"
3186,CANTO XXI,"Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall. While there"
3187,CANTO XXI,"I fix’d my ken below, “Mark! mark!” my guide"
3188,CANTO XXI,"Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,"
3189,CANTO XXI,"Wherein I stood. I turn’d myself as one,"
3190,CANTO XXI,Impatient to behold that which beheld
3191,CANTO XXI,"He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,"
3192,CANTO XXI,That he his flight delays not for the view.
3193,CANTO XXI,"Behind me I discern’d a devil black,"
3194,CANTO XXI,"That running, up advanc’d along the rock."
3195,CANTO XXI,Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!
3196,CANTO XXI,"In act how bitter did he seem, with wings"
3197,CANTO XXI,Buoyant outstretch’d and feet of nimblest tread!
3198,CANTO XXI,His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp
3199,CANTO XXI,Was with a sinner charg’d; by either haunch
3200,CANTO XXI,"He held him, the foot’s sinew griping fast."
3201,CANTO XXI,
3202,CANTO XXI,"“Ye of our bridge!” he cried, “keen-talon’d fiends!"
3203,CANTO XXI,Lo! one of Santa Zita’s elders! Him
3204,CANTO XXI,"Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more."
3205,CANTO XXI,"That land hath store of such. All men are there,"
3206,CANTO XXI,"Except Bonturo, barterers: of ‘no’"
3207,CANTO XXI,For lucre there an ‘aye’ is quickly made.”
3208,CANTO XXI,
3209,CANTO XXI,"Him dashing down, o’er the rough rock he turn’d,"
3210,CANTO XXI,Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos’d
3211,CANTO XXI,Sped with like eager haste. That other sank
3212,CANTO XXI,And forthwith writing to the surface rose.
3213,CANTO XXI,"But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,"
3214,CANTO XXI,Cried “Here the hallow’d visage saves not: here
3215,CANTO XXI,Is other swimming than in Serchio’s wave.
3216,CANTO XXI,"Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,"
3217,CANTO XXI,"Take heed thou mount not o’er the pitch.” This said,"
3218,CANTO XXI,"They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,"
3219,CANTO XXI,And shouted: “Cover’d thou must sport thee here;
3220,CANTO XXI,"So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.”"
3221,CANTO XXI,"E’en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,"
3222,CANTO XXI,To thrust the flesh into the caldron down
3223,CANTO XXI,"With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top."
3224,CANTO XXI,
3225,CANTO XXI,"Me then my guide bespake: “Lest they descry,"
3226,CANTO XXI,"That thou art here, behind a craggy rock"
3227,CANTO XXI,Bend low and screen thee; and whate’er of force
3228,CANTO XXI,"Be offer’d me, or insult, fear thou not:"
3229,CANTO XXI,"For I am well advis’d, who have been erst"
3230,CANTO XXI,In the like fray.” Beyond the bridge’s head
3231,CANTO XXI,"Therewith he pass’d, and reaching the sixth pier,"
3232,CANTO XXI,Behov’d him then a forehead terror-proof.
3233,CANTO XXI,
3234,CANTO XXI,"With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth"
3235,CANTO XXI,"Upon the poor man’s back, who suddenly"
3236,CANTO XXI,From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush’d
3237,CANTO XXI,"Those from beneath the arch, and against him"
3238,CANTO XXI,Their weapons all they pointed. He aloud:
3239,CANTO XXI,“Be none of you outrageous: ere your time
3240,CANTO XXI,"Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,"
3241,CANTO XXI,"Who having heard my words, decide he then"
3242,CANTO XXI,"If he shall tear these limbs.” They shouted loud,"
3243,CANTO XXI,"“Go, Malacoda!” Whereat one advanc’d,"
3244,CANTO XXI,"The others standing firm, and as he came,"
3245,CANTO XXI,“What may this turn avail him?” he exclaim’d.
3246,CANTO XXI,
3247,CANTO XXI,"“Believ’st thou, Malacoda! I had come"
3248,CANTO XXI,"Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,”"
3249,CANTO XXI,"My teacher answered, “without will divine"
3250,CANTO XXI,And destiny propitious? Pass we then
3251,CANTO XXI,"For so Heaven’s pleasure is, that I should lead"
3252,CANTO XXI,Another through this savage wilderness.”
3253,CANTO XXI,
3254,CANTO XXI,"Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop"
3255,CANTO XXI,"The instrument of torture at his feet,"
3256,CANTO XXI,And to the rest exclaim’d: “We have no power
3257,CANTO XXI,To strike him.” Then to me my guide: “O thou!
3258,CANTO XXI,Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit
3259,CANTO XXI,"Low crouching, safely now to me return.”"
3260,CANTO XXI,
3261,CANTO XXI,"I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends"
3262,CANTO XXI,Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz’d
3263,CANTO XXI,Lest they should break the compact they had made.
3264,CANTO XXI,"Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw"
3265,CANTO XXI,"Th’ infantry dreading, lest his covenant"
3266,CANTO XXI,The foe should break; so close he hemm’d them round.
3267,CANTO XXI,
3268,CANTO XXI,"I to my leader’s side adher’d, mine eyes"
3269,CANTO XXI,With fixt and motionless observance bent
3270,CANTO XXI,On their unkindly visage. They their hooks
3271,CANTO XXI,"Protruding, one the other thus bespake:"
3272,CANTO XXI,“Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?” To whom
3273,CANTO XXI,Was answer’d: “Even so; nor miss thy aim.”
3274,CANTO XXI,
3275,CANTO XXI,"But he, who was in conf’rence with my guide,"
3276,CANTO XXI,"Turn’d rapid round, and thus the demon spake:"
3277,CANTO XXI,"“Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!” Then to us"
3278,CANTO XXI,He added: “Further footing to your step
3279,CANTO XXI,"This rock affords not, shiver’d to the base"
3280,CANTO XXI,"Of the sixth arch. But would you still proceed,"
3281,CANTO XXI,"Up by this cavern go: not distant far,"
3282,CANTO XXI,Another rock will yield you passage safe.
3283,CANTO XXI,"Yesterday, later by five hours than now,"
3284,CANTO XXI,Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill’d
3285,CANTO XXI,"The circuit of their course, since here the way"
3286,CANTO XXI,Was broken. Thitherward I straight dispatch
3287,CANTO XXI,"Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy"
3288,CANTO XXI,If any on the surface bask. With them
3289,CANTO XXI,Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.
3290,CANTO XXI,"Come Alichino forth,” with that he cried,"
3291,CANTO XXI,"“And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!"
3292,CANTO XXI,The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.
3293,CANTO XXI,"With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,"
3294,CANTO XXI,"Fang’d Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,"
3295,CANTO XXI,"And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant."
3296,CANTO XXI,"Search ye around the bubbling tar. For these,"
3297,CANTO XXI,"In safety lead them, where the other crag"
3298,CANTO XXI,Uninterrupted traverses the dens.”
3299,CANTO XXI,
3300,CANTO XXI,I then: “O master! what a sight is there!
3301,CANTO XXI,"Ah! without escort, journey we alone,"
3302,CANTO XXI,"Which, if thou know the way, I covet not."
3303,CANTO XXI,"Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark"
3304,CANTO XXI,"How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl"
3305,CANTO XXI,Threatens us present tortures?” He replied:
3306,CANTO XXI,"“I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,"
3307,CANTO XXI,Gnarl on: ’tis but in token of their spite
3308,CANTO XXI,"Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep’d.”"
3309,CANTO XXI,
3310,CANTO XXI,To leftward o’er the pier they turn’d; but each
3311,CANTO XXI,"Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,"
3312,CANTO XXI,"Toward their leader for a signal looking,"
3313,CANTO XXI,Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.
3314,CANTO XXI,
3315,CANTO XXI,
3316,CANTO XXI,
3317,CANTO XXI,
3318,CANTO XXII,CANTO XXII
3319,CANTO XXII,
3320,CANTO XXII,
3321,CANTO XXII,It hath been heretofore my chance to see
3322,CANTO XXII,"Horsemen with martial order shifting camp,"
3323,CANTO XXII,"To onset sallying, or in muster rang’d,"
3324,CANTO XXII,Or in retreat sometimes outstretch’d for flight;
3325,CANTO XXII,Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers
3326,CANTO XXII,"Scouring thy plains, Arezzo! have I seen,"
3327,CANTO XXII,"And clashing tournaments, and tilting jousts,"
3328,CANTO XXII,"Now with the sound of trumpets, now of bells,"
3329,CANTO XXII,"Tabors, or signals made from castled heights,"
3330,CANTO XXII,"And with inventions multiform, our own,"
3331,CANTO XXII,Or introduc’d from foreign land; but ne’er
3332,CANTO XXII,"To such a strange recorder I beheld,"
3333,CANTO XXII,"In evolution moving, horse nor foot,"
3334,CANTO XXII,"Nor ship, that tack’d by sign from land or star."
3335,CANTO XXII,
3336,CANTO XXII,With the ten demons on our way we went;
3337,CANTO XXII,Ah fearful company! but in the church
3338,CANTO XXII,"With saints, with gluttons at the tavern’s mess."
3339,CANTO XXII,
3340,CANTO XXII,"Still earnest on the pitch I gaz’d, to mark"
3341,CANTO XXII,"All things whate’er the chasm contain’d, and those"
3342,CANTO XXII,"Who burn’d within. As dolphins, that, in sign"
3343,CANTO XXII,"To mariners, heave high their arched backs,"
3344,CANTO XXII,That thence forewarn’d they may advise to save
3345,CANTO XXII,"Their threaten’d vessels; so, at intervals,"
3346,CANTO XXII,"To ease the pain his back some sinner show’d,"
3347,CANTO XXII,Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.
3348,CANTO XXII,
3349,CANTO XXII,"E’en as the frogs, that of a wat’ry moat"
3350,CANTO XXII,"Stand at the brink, with the jaws only out,"
3351,CANTO XXII,"Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,"
3352,CANTO XXII,"Thus on each part the sinners stood, but soon"
3353,CANTO XXII,"As Barbariccia was at hand, so they"
3354,CANTO XXII,"Drew back under the wave. I saw, and yet"
3355,CANTO XXII,"My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,"
3356,CANTO XXII,"As it befalls that oft one frog remains,"
3357,CANTO XXII,"While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,"
3358,CANTO XXII,"Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz’d"
3359,CANTO XXII,"His clotted locks, and dragg’d him sprawling up,"
3360,CANTO XXII,That he appear’d to me an otter. Each
3361,CANTO XXII,"Already by their names I knew, so well"
3362,CANTO XXII,"When they were chosen, I observ’d, and mark’d"
3363,CANTO XXII,How one the other call’d. “O Rubicant!
3364,CANTO XXII,"See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,”"
3365,CANTO XXII,Shouted together all the cursed crew.
3366,CANTO XXII,
3367,CANTO XXII,"Then I: “Inform thee, master! if thou may,"
3368,CANTO XXII,"What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand"
3369,CANTO XXII,His foes have laid.” My leader to his side
3370,CANTO XXII,"Approach’d, and whence he came inquir’d, to whom"
3371,CANTO XXII,Was answer’d thus: “Born in Navarre’s domain
3372,CANTO XXII,"My mother plac’d me in a lord’s retinue,"
3373,CANTO XXII,"For she had borne me to a losel vile,"
3374,CANTO XXII,A spendthrift of his substance and himself.
3375,CANTO XXII,"The good king Thibault after that I serv’d,"
3376,CANTO XXII,"To peculating here my thoughts were turn’d,"
3377,CANTO XXII,Whereof I give account in this dire heat.”
3378,CANTO XXII,
3379,CANTO XXII,"Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk"
3380,CANTO XXII,"Issued on either side, as from a boar,"
3381,CANTO XXII,Ript him with one of these. ’Twixt evil claws
3382,CANTO XXII,"The mouse had fall’n: but Barbariccia cried,"
3383,CANTO XXII,"Seizing him with both arms: “Stand thou apart,"
3384,CANTO XXII,While I do fix him on my prong transpierc’d.”
3385,CANTO XXII,"Then added, turning to my guide his face,"
3386,CANTO XXII,"“Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,"
3387,CANTO XXII,Ere he again be rent.” My leader thus:
3388,CANTO XXII,“Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;
3389,CANTO XXII,Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land
3390,CANTO XXII,"Under the tar?”—“I parted,” he replied,"
3391,CANTO XXII,"“But now from one, who sojourn’d not far thence;"
3392,CANTO XXII,So were I under shelter now with him!
3393,CANTO XXII,Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more.”—.
3394,CANTO XXII,
3395,CANTO XXII,"“Too long we suffer,” Libicocco cried,"
3396,CANTO XXII,"Then, darting forth a prong, seiz’d on his arm,"
3397,CANTO XXII,And mangled bore away the sinewy part.
3398,CANTO XXII,Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath
3399,CANTO XXII,"Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,"
3400,CANTO XXII,"Turning on all sides round, with threat’ning brow"
3401,CANTO XXII,"Restrain’d them. When their strife a little ceas’d,"
3402,CANTO XXII,"Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,"
3403,CANTO XXII,My teacher thus without delay inquir’d:
3404,CANTO XXII,"“Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap"
3405,CANTO XXII,"Parting, as thou has told, thou cam’st to shore?”—"
3406,CANTO XXII,
3407,CANTO XXII,"“It was the friar Gomita,” he rejoin’d,"
3408,CANTO XXII,"“He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,"
3409,CANTO XXII,"Who had his master’s enemies in hand,"
3410,CANTO XXII,And us’d them so that they commend him well.
3411,CANTO XXII,"Money he took, and them at large dismiss’d."
3412,CANTO XXII,So he reports: and in each other charge
3413,CANTO XXII,"Committed to his keeping, play’d the part"
3414,CANTO XXII,Of barterer to the height: with him doth herd
3415,CANTO XXII,"The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche."
3416,CANTO XXII,"Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue"
3417,CANTO XXII,Is never weary. Out! alas! behold
3418,CANTO XXII,"That other, how he grins! More would I say,"
3419,CANTO XXII,But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore.”
3420,CANTO XXII,
3421,CANTO XXII,"Their captain then to Farfarello turning,"
3422,CANTO XXII,"Who roll’d his moony eyes in act to strike,"
3423,CANTO XXII,Rebuk’d him thus: “Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!”—
3424,CANTO XXII,
3425,CANTO XXII,"“If ye desire to see or hear,” he thus"
3426,CANTO XXII,"Quaking with dread resum’d, “or Tuscan spirits"
3427,CANTO XXII,"Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear."
3428,CANTO XXII,"Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,"
3429,CANTO XXII,"So that no vengeance they may fear from them,"
3430,CANTO XXII,"And I, remaining in this self-same place,"
3431,CANTO XXII,"Will for myself but one, make sev’n appear,"
3432,CANTO XXII,When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so
3433,CANTO XXII,Our custom is to call each other up.”
3434,CANTO XXII,
3435,CANTO XXII,"Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn’d,"
3436,CANTO XXII,"Then wagg’d the head and spake: “Hear his device,"
3437,CANTO XXII,"Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down.”"
3438,CANTO XXII,
3439,CANTO XXII,"Whereto he thus, who fail’d not in rich store"
3440,CANTO XXII,"Of nice-wove toils; “ Mischief forsooth extreme,"
3441,CANTO XXII,Meant only to procure myself more woe!”
3442,CANTO XXII,
3443,CANTO XXII,"No longer Alichino then refrain’d,"
3444,CANTO XXII,"But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:"
3445,CANTO XXII,"“If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot"
3446,CANTO XXII,"Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat"
3447,CANTO XXII,"My plumes. Quit we the vantage ground, and let"
3448,CANTO XXII,"The bank be as a shield, that we may see"
3449,CANTO XXII,If singly thou prevail against us all.”
3450,CANTO XXII,
3451,CANTO XXII,"Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!"
3452,CANTO XXII,
3453,CANTO XXII,"They each one turn’d his eyes to the’ other shore,"
3454,CANTO XXII,"He first, who was the hardest to persuade."
3455,CANTO XXII,"The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,"
3456,CANTO XXII,"Planted his feet on land, and at one leap"
3457,CANTO XXII,Escaping disappointed their resolve.
3458,CANTO XXII,
3459,CANTO XXII,"Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,"
3460,CANTO XXII,Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit
3461,CANTO XXII,"He therefore sped, exclaiming; “Thou art caught.”"
3462,CANTO XXII,
3463,CANTO XXII,But little it avail’d: terror outstripp’d
3464,CANTO XXII,"His following flight: the other plung’d beneath,"
3465,CANTO XXII,And he with upward pinion rais’d his breast:
3466,CANTO XXII,"E’en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives"
3467,CANTO XXII,"The falcon near, dives instant down, while he"
3468,CANTO XXII,Enrag’d and spent retires. That mockery
3469,CANTO XXII,"In Calcabrina fury stirr’d, who flew"
3470,CANTO XXII,"After him, with desire of strife inflam’d;"
3471,CANTO XXII,"And, for the barterer had ’scap’d, so turn’d"
3472,CANTO XXII,His talons on his comrade. O’er the dyke
3473,CANTO XXII,In grapple close they join’d; but the’ other prov’d
3474,CANTO XXII,A goshawk able to rend well his foe;
3475,CANTO XXII,And in the boiling lake both fell. The heat
3476,CANTO XXII,"Was umpire soon between them, but in vain"
3477,CANTO XXII,"To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued"
3478,CANTO XXII,"Their pennons. Barbariccia, as the rest,"
3479,CANTO XXII,"That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch’d"
3480,CANTO XXII,"From the’ other coast, with all their weapons arm’d."
3481,CANTO XXII,"They, to their post on each side speedily"
3482,CANTO XXII,"Descending, stretch’d their hooks toward the fiends,"
3483,CANTO XXII,"Who flounder’d, inly burning from their scars:"
3484,CANTO XXII,And we departing left them to that broil.
3485,CANTO XXII,
3486,CANTO XXII,
3487,CANTO XXII,
3488,CANTO XXII,
3489,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
3490,CANTO XXIII,
3491,CANTO XXIII,
3492,CANTO XXIII,"In silence and in solitude we went,"
3493,CANTO XXIII,"One first, the other following his steps,"
3494,CANTO XXIII,As minor friars journeying on their road.
3495,CANTO XXIII,
3496,CANTO XXIII,The present fray had turn’d my thoughts to muse
3497,CANTO XXIII,"Upon old Aesop’s fable, where he told"
3498,CANTO XXIII,What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.
3499,CANTO XXIII,"For language hath not sounds more like in sense,"
3500,CANTO XXIII,"Than are these chances, if the origin"
3501,CANTO XXIII,And end of each be heedfully compar’d.
3502,CANTO XXIII,"And as one thought bursts from another forth,"
3503,CANTO XXIII,"So afterward from that another sprang,"
3504,CANTO XXIII,Which added doubly to my former fear.
3505,CANTO XXIII,For thus I reason’d: “These through us have been
3506,CANTO XXIII,"So foil’d, with loss and mock’ry so complete,"
3507,CANTO XXIII,As needs must sting them sore. If anger then
3508,CANTO XXIII,"Be to their evil will conjoin’d, more fell"
3509,CANTO XXIII,"They shall pursue us, than the savage hound"
3510,CANTO XXIII,"Snatches the leveret, panting ’twixt his jaws.”"
3511,CANTO XXIII,
3512,CANTO XXIII,Already I perceiv’d my hair stand all
3513,CANTO XXIII,"On end with terror, and look’d eager back."
3514,CANTO XXIII,
3515,CANTO XXIII,"“Teacher,” I thus began, “if speedily"
3516,CANTO XXIII,"Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread"
3517,CANTO XXIII,Those evil talons. Even now behind
3518,CANTO XXIII,They urge us: quick imagination works
3519,CANTO XXIII,"So forcibly, that I already feel them.”"
3520,CANTO XXIII,
3521,CANTO XXIII,"He answer’d: “Were I form’d of leaded glass,"
3522,CANTO XXIII,I should not sooner draw unto myself
3523,CANTO XXIII,"Thy outward image, than I now imprint"
3524,CANTO XXIII,That from within. This moment came thy thoughts
3525,CANTO XXIII,"Presented before mine, with similar act"
3526,CANTO XXIII,"And count’nance similar, so that from both"
3527,CANTO XXIII,I one design have fram’d. If the right coast
3528,CANTO XXIII,"Incline so much, that we may thence descend"
3529,CANTO XXIII,"Into the other chasm, we shall escape"
3530,CANTO XXIII,Secure from this imagined pursuit.”
3531,CANTO XXIII,
3532,CANTO XXIII,"He had not spoke his purpose to the end,"
3533,CANTO XXIII,When I from far beheld them with spread wings
3534,CANTO XXIII,Approach to take us. Suddenly my guide
3535,CANTO XXIII,"Caught me, ev’n as a mother that from sleep"
3536,CANTO XXIII,"Is by the noise arous’d, and near her sees"
3537,CANTO XXIII,"The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe"
3538,CANTO XXIII,"And flies ne’er pausing, careful more of him"
3539,CANTO XXIII,"Than of herself, that but a single vest"
3540,CANTO XXIII,Clings round her limbs. Down from the jutting beach
3541,CANTO XXIII,"Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,"
3542,CANTO XXIII,Which closes on one part the other chasm.
3543,CANTO XXIII,
3544,CANTO XXIII,Never ran water with such hurrying pace
3545,CANTO XXIII,"Adown the tube to turn a landmill’s wheel,"
3546,CANTO XXIII,"When nearest it approaches to the spokes,"
3547,CANTO XXIII,"As then along that edge my master ran,"
3548,CANTO XXIII,"Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,"
3549,CANTO XXIII,Not a companion. Scarcely had his feet
3550,CANTO XXIII,"Reach’d to the lowest of the bed beneath,"
3551,CANTO XXIII,When over us the steep they reach’d; but fear
3552,CANTO XXIII,"In him was none; for that high Providence,"
3553,CANTO XXIII,"Which plac’d them ministers of the fifth foss,"
3554,CANTO XXIII,Power of departing thence took from them all.
3555,CANTO XXIII,
3556,CANTO XXIII,"There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,"
3557,CANTO XXIII,"Who pac’d with tardy steps around, and wept,"
3558,CANTO XXIII,Faint in appearance and o’ercome with toil.
3559,CANTO XXIII,"Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down"
3560,CANTO XXIII,"Before their eyes, in fashion like to those"
3561,CANTO XXIII,Worn by the monks in Cologne. Their outside
3562,CANTO XXIII,"Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,"
3563,CANTO XXIII,"But leaden all within, and of such weight,"
3564,CANTO XXIII,That Frederick’s compar’d to these were straw.
3565,CANTO XXIII,"Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!"
3566,CANTO XXIII,
3567,CANTO XXIII,We yet once more with them together turn’d
3568,CANTO XXIII,"To leftward, on their dismal moan intent."
3569,CANTO XXIII,"But by the weight oppress’d, so slowly came"
3570,CANTO XXIII,"The fainting people, that our company"
3571,CANTO XXIII,Was chang’d at every movement of the step.
3572,CANTO XXIII,
3573,CANTO XXIII,Whence I my guide address’d: “See that thou find
3574,CANTO XXIII,"Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,"
3575,CANTO XXIII,And to that end look round thee as thou go’st.”
3576,CANTO XXIII,
3577,CANTO XXIII,"Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,"
3578,CANTO XXIII,"Cried after us aloud: “Hold in your feet,"
3579,CANTO XXIII,Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.
3580,CANTO XXIII,Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.”
3581,CANTO XXIII,
3582,CANTO XXIII,"Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:"
3583,CANTO XXIII,"“Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.”"
3584,CANTO XXIII,
3585,CANTO XXIII,"I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look"
3586,CANTO XXIII,Impatient eagerness of mind was mark’d
3587,CANTO XXIII,To overtake me; but the load they bare
3588,CANTO XXIII,And narrow path retarded their approach.
3589,CANTO XXIII,
3590,CANTO XXIII,"Soon as arriv’d, they with an eye askance"
3591,CANTO XXIII,"Perus’d me, but spake not: then turning each"
3592,CANTO XXIII,To other thus conferring said: “This one
3593,CANTO XXIII,"Seems, by the action of his throat, alive."
3594,CANTO XXIII,"And, be they dead, what privilege allows"
3595,CANTO XXIII,They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?”
3596,CANTO XXIII,
3597,CANTO XXIII,"Then thus to me: “Tuscan, who visitest"
3598,CANTO XXIII,"The college of the mourning hypocrites,"
3599,CANTO XXIII,Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.”
3600,CANTO XXIII,
3601,CANTO XXIII,"“By Arno’s pleasant stream,” I thus replied,"
3602,CANTO XXIII,"“In the great city I was bred and grew,"
3603,CANTO XXIII,And wear the body I have ever worn.
3604,CANTO XXIII,"but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,"
3605,CANTO XXIII,"As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?"
3606,CANTO XXIII,What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?”
3607,CANTO XXIII,"“Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,”"
3608,CANTO XXIII,"One of them answer’d, “are so leaden gross,"
3609,CANTO XXIII,That with their weight they make the balances
3610,CANTO XXIII,"To crack beneath them. Joyous friars we were,"
3611,CANTO XXIII,"Bologna’s natives, Catalano I,"
3612,CANTO XXIII,"He Loderingo nam’d, and by thy land"
3613,CANTO XXIII,"Together taken, as men used to take"
3614,CANTO XXIII,"A single and indifferent arbiter,"
3615,CANTO XXIII,"To reconcile their strifes. How there we sped,"
3616,CANTO XXIII,Gardingo’s vicinage can best declare.”
3617,CANTO XXIII,
3618,CANTO XXIII,"“O friars!” I began, “your miseries—” But there brake off, for one had"
3619,CANTO XXIII,"caught my eye,"
3620,CANTO XXIII,Fix’d to a cross with three stakes on the ground:
3621,CANTO XXIII,"He, when he saw me, writh’d himself, throughout"
3622,CANTO XXIII,"Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard."
3623,CANTO XXIII,"And Catalano, who thereof was ’ware,"
3624,CANTO XXIII,"Thus spake: “That pierced spirit, whom intent"
3625,CANTO XXIII,"Thou view’st, was he who gave the Pharisees"
3626,CANTO XXIII,"Counsel, that it were fitting for one man"
3627,CANTO XXIII,To suffer for the people. He doth lie
3628,CANTO XXIII,"Transverse; nor any passes, but him first"
3629,CANTO XXIII,Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.
3630,CANTO XXIII,In straits like this along the foss are plac’d
3631,CANTO XXIII,"The father of his consort, and the rest"
3632,CANTO XXIII,"Partakers in that council, seed of ill"
3633,CANTO XXIII,"And sorrow to the Jews.” I noted then,"
3634,CANTO XXIII,"How Virgil gaz’d with wonder upon him,"
3635,CANTO XXIII,Thus abjectly extended on the cross
3636,CANTO XXIII,In banishment eternal. To the friar
3637,CANTO XXIII,"He next his words address’d: “We pray ye tell,"
3638,CANTO XXIII,"If so be lawful, whether on our right"
3639,CANTO XXIII,"Lies any opening in the rock, whereby"
3640,CANTO XXIII,"We both may issue hence, without constraint"
3641,CANTO XXIII,"On the dark angels, that compell’d they come"
3642,CANTO XXIII,To lead us from this depth.” He thus replied:
3643,CANTO XXIII,"“Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock"
3644,CANTO XXIII,"From the next circle moving, which o’ersteps"
3645,CANTO XXIII,"Each vale of horror, save that here his cope"
3646,CANTO XXIII,Is shatter’d. By the ruin ye may mount:
3647,CANTO XXIII,"For on the side it slants, and most the height"
3648,CANTO XXIII,Rises below.” With head bent down awhile
3649,CANTO XXIII,"My leader stood, then spake: “He warn’d us ill,"
3650,CANTO XXIII,Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.”
3651,CANTO XXIII,
3652,CANTO XXIII,To whom the friar: At Bologna erst
3653,CANTO XXIII,"I many vices of the devil heard,"
3654,CANTO XXIII,"Among the rest was said, ‘He is a liar,"
3655,CANTO XXIII,"And the father of lies!’” When he had spoke,"
3656,CANTO XXIII,"My leader with large strides proceeded on,"
3657,CANTO XXIII,Somewhat disturb’d with anger in his look.
3658,CANTO XXIII,
3659,CANTO XXIII,"I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,"
3660,CANTO XXIII,"And following, his beloved footsteps mark’d."
3661,CANTO XXIII,
3662,CANTO XXIII,
3663,CANTO XXIII,
3664,CANTO XXIII,
3665,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
3666,CANTO XXIV,
3667,CANTO XXIV,
3668,CANTO XXIV,"In the year’s early nonage, when the sun"
3669,CANTO XXIV,"Tempers his tresses in Aquarius’ urn,"
3670,CANTO XXIV,"And now towards equal day the nights recede,"
3671,CANTO XXIV,When as the rime upon the earth puts on
3672,CANTO XXIV,"Her dazzling sister’s image, but not long"
3673,CANTO XXIV,"Her milder sway endures, then riseth up"
3674,CANTO XXIV,"The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,"
3675,CANTO XXIV,And looking out beholds the plain around
3676,CANTO XXIV,"All whiten’d, whence impatiently he smites"
3677,CANTO XXIV,"His thighs, and to his hut returning in,"
3678,CANTO XXIV,"There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,"
3679,CANTO XXIV,As a discomfited and helpless man;
3680,CANTO XXIV,"Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope"
3681,CANTO XXIV,"Spring in his bosom, finding e’en thus soon"
3682,CANTO XXIV,"The world hath chang’d its count’nance, grasps his crook,"
3683,CANTO XXIV,And forth to pasture drives his little flock:
3684,CANTO XXIV,So me my guide dishearten’d when I saw
3685,CANTO XXIV,"His troubled forehead, and so speedily"
3686,CANTO XXIV,That ill was cur’d; for at the fallen bridge
3687,CANTO XXIV,"Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,"
3688,CANTO XXIV,"He turn’d him back, as that I first beheld"
3689,CANTO XXIV,At the steep mountain’s foot. Regarding well
3690,CANTO XXIV,"The ruin, and some counsel first maintain’d"
3691,CANTO XXIV,"With his own thought, he open’d wide his arm"
3692,CANTO XXIV,"And took me up. As one, who, while he works,"
3693,CANTO XXIV,"Computes his labour’s issue, that he seems"
3694,CANTO XXIV,"Still to foresee the’ effect, so lifting me"
3695,CANTO XXIV,"Up to the summit of one peak, he fix’d"
3696,CANTO XXIV,"His eye upon another. “Grapple that,”"
3697,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, “but first make proof, if it be such"
3698,CANTO XXIV,As will sustain thee.” For one capp’d with lead
3699,CANTO XXIV,"This were no journey. Scarcely he, though light,"
3700,CANTO XXIV,"And I, though onward push’d from crag to crag,"
3701,CANTO XXIV,Could mount. And if the precinct of this coast
3702,CANTO XXIV,"Were not less ample than the last, for him"
3703,CANTO XXIV,"I know not, but my strength had surely fail’d."
3704,CANTO XXIV,But Malebolge all toward the mouth
3705,CANTO XXIV,"Inclining of the nethermost abyss,"
3706,CANTO XXIV,"The site of every valley hence requires,"
3707,CANTO XXIV,"That one side upward slope, the other fall."
3708,CANTO XXIV,
3709,CANTO XXIV,At length the point of our descent we reach’d
3710,CANTO XXIV,"From the last flag: soon as to that arriv’d,"
3711,CANTO XXIV,"So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,"
3712,CANTO XXIV,"I could no further, but did seat me there."
3713,CANTO XXIV,
3714,CANTO XXIV,“Now needs thy best of man;” so spake my guide:
3715,CANTO XXIV,"“For not on downy plumes, nor under shade"
3716,CANTO XXIV,"Of canopy reposing, fame is won,"
3717,CANTO XXIV,Without which whosoe’er consumes his days
3718,CANTO XXIV,"Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,"
3719,CANTO XXIV,As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.
3720,CANTO XXIV,Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness
3721,CANTO XXIV,"By the mind’s effort, in each struggle form’d"
3722,CANTO XXIV,"To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight"
3723,CANTO XXIV,Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.
3724,CANTO XXIV,A longer ladder yet remains to scale.
3725,CANTO XXIV,From these to have escap’d sufficeth not.
3726,CANTO XXIV,"If well thou note me, profit by my words.”"
3727,CANTO XXIV,
3728,CANTO XXIV,"I straightway rose, and show’d myself less spent"
3729,CANTO XXIV,"Than I in truth did feel me. “On,” I cried,"
3730,CANTO XXIV,“For I am stout and fearless.” Up the rock
3731,CANTO XXIV,"Our way we held, more rugged than before,"
3732,CANTO XXIV,Narrower and steeper far to climb. From talk
3733,CANTO XXIV,"I ceas’d not, as we journey’d, so to seem"
3734,CANTO XXIV,Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss
3735,CANTO XXIV,"Did issue forth, for utt’rance suited ill."
3736,CANTO XXIV,"Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,"
3737,CANTO XXIV,"What were the words I knew not, but who spake"
3738,CANTO XXIV,"Seem’d mov’d in anger. Down I stoop’d to look,"
3739,CANTO XXIV,But my quick eye might reach not to the depth
3740,CANTO XXIV,For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:
3741,CANTO XXIV,"“To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,"
3742,CANTO XXIV,And from the wall dismount we; for as hence
3743,CANTO XXIV,"I hear and understand not, so I see"
3744,CANTO XXIV,"Beneath, and naught discern.”—“I answer not,”"
3745,CANTO XXIV,"Said he, “but by the deed. To fair request"
3746,CANTO XXIV,Silent performance maketh best return.”
3747,CANTO XXIV,
3748,CANTO XXIV,"We from the bridge’s head descended, where"
3749,CANTO XXIV,"To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm"
3750,CANTO XXIV,"Opening to view, I saw a crowd within"
3751,CANTO XXIV,"Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape"
3752,CANTO XXIV,"And hideous, that remembrance in my veins"
3753,CANTO XXIV,Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands
3754,CANTO XXIV,"Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,"
3755,CANTO XXIV,"Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,"
3756,CANTO XXIV,"Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire"
3757,CANTO XXIV,"Or in such numbers swarming ne’er she shew’d,"
3758,CANTO XXIV,"Not with all Ethiopia, and whate’er"
3759,CANTO XXIV,Above the Erythraean sea is spawn’d.
3760,CANTO XXIV,
3761,CANTO XXIV,Amid this dread exuberance of woe
3762,CANTO XXIV,"Ran naked spirits wing’d with horrid fear,"
3763,CANTO XXIV,"Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,"
3764,CANTO XXIV,Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.
3765,CANTO XXIV,"With serpents were their hands behind them bound,"
3766,CANTO XXIV,Which through their reins infix’d the tail and head
3767,CANTO XXIV,Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one
3768,CANTO XXIV,"Near to our side, darted an adder up,"
3769,CANTO XXIV,"And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,"
3770,CANTO XXIV,Transpierc’d him. Far more quickly than e’er pen
3771,CANTO XXIV,"Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn’d, and chang’d"
3772,CANTO XXIV,"To ashes, all pour’d out upon the earth."
3773,CANTO XXIV,"When there dissolv’d he lay, the dust again"
3774,CANTO XXIV,"Uproll’d spontaneous, and the self-same form"
3775,CANTO XXIV,"Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell,"
3776,CANTO XXIV,"The’ Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years"
3777,CANTO XXIV,"Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith"
3778,CANTO XXIV,Renascent. Blade nor herb throughout his life
3779,CANTO XXIV,"He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone"
3780,CANTO XXIV,And odorous amomum: swaths of nard
3781,CANTO XXIV,"And myrrh his funeral shroud. As one that falls,"
3782,CANTO XXIV,"He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg’d"
3783,CANTO XXIV,"To earth, or through obstruction fettering up"
3784,CANTO XXIV,"In chains invisible the powers of man,"
3785,CANTO XXIV,"Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,"
3786,CANTO XXIV,Bewilder’d with the monstrous agony
3787,CANTO XXIV,"He hath endur’d, and wildly staring sighs;"
3788,CANTO XXIV,So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.
3789,CANTO XXIV,
3790,CANTO XXIV,"Oh! how severe God’s judgment, that deals out"
3791,CANTO XXIV,Such blows in stormy vengeance! Who he was
3792,CANTO XXIV,"My teacher next inquir’d, and thus in few"
3793,CANTO XXIV,"He answer’d: “Vanni Fucci am I call’d,"
3794,CANTO XXIV,Not long since rained down from Tuscany
3795,CANTO XXIV,To this dire gullet. Me the beastial life
3796,CANTO XXIV,"And not the human pleas’d, mule that I was,"
3797,CANTO XXIV,Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.”
3798,CANTO XXIV,
3799,CANTO XXIV,"I then to Virgil: “Bid him stir not hence,"
3800,CANTO XXIV,And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once
3801,CANTO XXIV,A man I knew him choleric and bloody.”
3802,CANTO XXIV,
3803,CANTO XXIV,"The sinner heard and feign’d not, but towards me"
3804,CANTO XXIV,"His mind directing and his face, wherein"
3805,CANTO XXIV,"Was dismal shame depictur’d, thus he spake:"
3806,CANTO XXIV,“It grieves me more to have been caught by thee
3807,CANTO XXIV,"In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than"
3808,CANTO XXIV,When I was taken from the other life.
3809,CANTO XXIV,I have no power permitted to deny
3810,CANTO XXIV,What thou inquirest.” I am doom’d thus low
3811,CANTO XXIV,"To dwell, for that the sacristy by me"
3812,CANTO XXIV,"Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,"
3813,CANTO XXIV,And with the guilt another falsely charged.
3814,CANTO XXIV,"But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,"
3815,CANTO XXIV,So as thou e’er shalt ’scape this darksome realm
3816,CANTO XXIV,Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.
3817,CANTO XXIV,"Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,"
3818,CANTO XXIV,Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.
3819,CANTO XXIV,"From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,"
3820,CANTO XXIV,"A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,"
3821,CANTO XXIV,And sharp and eager driveth on the storm
3822,CANTO XXIV,"With arrowy hurtling o’er Piceno’s field,"
3823,CANTO XXIV,"Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike"
3824,CANTO XXIV,Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.
3825,CANTO XXIV,"This have I told, that grief may rend thy heart.”"
3826,CANTO XXIV,
3827,CANTO XXIV,
3828,CANTO XXIV,
3829,CANTO XXIV,
3830,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
3831,CANTO XXV,
3832,CANTO XXV,
3833,CANTO XXV,"When he had spoke, the sinner rais’d his hands"
3834,CANTO XXV,"Pointed in mockery, and cried: “Take them, God!"
3835,CANTO XXV,I level them at thee!” From that day forth
3836,CANTO XXV,The serpents were my friends; for round his neck
3837,CANTO XXV,"One of then rolling twisted, as it said,"
3838,CANTO XXV,"“Be silent, tongue!” Another to his arms"
3839,CANTO XXV,"Upgliding, tied them, riveting itself"
3840,CANTO XXV,"So close, it took from them the power to move."
3841,CANTO XXV,
3842,CANTO XXV,Pistoia! Ah Pistoia! why dost doubt
3843,CANTO XXV,"To turn thee into ashes, cumb’ring earth"
3844,CANTO XXV,"No longer, since in evil act so far"
3845,CANTO XXV,"Thou hast outdone thy seed? I did not mark,"
3846,CANTO XXV,"Through all the gloomy circles of the’ abyss,"
3847,CANTO XXV,"Spirit, that swell’d so proudly ’gainst his God,"
3848,CANTO XXV,"Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled,"
3849,CANTO XXV,Nor utter’d more; and after him there came
3850,CANTO XXV,"A centaur full of fury, shouting, “Where"
3851,CANTO XXV,Where is the caitiff?” On Maremma’s marsh
3852,CANTO XXV,"Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch"
3853,CANTO XXV,"They swarm’d, to where the human face begins."
3854,CANTO XXV,"Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,"
3855,CANTO XXV,"With open wings, a dragon breathing fire"
3856,CANTO XXV,On whomsoe’er he met. To me my guide:
3857,CANTO XXV,"“Cacus is this, who underneath the rock"
3858,CANTO XXV,Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.
3859,CANTO XXV,"He, from his brethren parted, here must tread"
3860,CANTO XXV,"A different journey, for his fraudful theft"
3861,CANTO XXV,"Of the great herd, that near him stall’d; whence found"
3862,CANTO XXV,"His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace"
3863,CANTO XXV,"Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on"
3864,CANTO XXV,"A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.”"
3865,CANTO XXV,
3866,CANTO XXV,"While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:"
3867,CANTO XXV,"And under us three spirits came, of whom"
3868,CANTO XXV,"Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim’d;"
3869,CANTO XXV,"“Say who are ye?” We then brake off discourse,"
3870,CANTO XXV,Intent on these alone. I knew them not;
3871,CANTO XXV,"But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one"
3872,CANTO XXV,"Had need to name another. “Where,” said he,"
3873,CANTO XXV,"“Doth Cianfa lurk?” I, for a sign my guide"
3874,CANTO XXV,"Should stand attentive, plac’d against my lips"
3875,CANTO XXV,"The finger lifted. If, O reader! now"
3876,CANTO XXV,"Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,"
3877,CANTO XXV,No marvel; for myself do scarce allow
3878,CANTO XXV,The witness of mine eyes. But as I looked
3879,CANTO XXV,"Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet"
3880,CANTO XXV,"Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:"
3881,CANTO XXV,"His midmost grasp’d the belly, a forefoot"
3882,CANTO XXV,Seiz’d on each arm (while deep in either cheek
3883,CANTO XXV,He flesh’d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs
3884,CANTO XXV,"Were spread, ’twixt which the tail inserted curl’d"
3885,CANTO XXV,Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne’er clasp’d
3886,CANTO XXV,"A dodder’d oak, as round the other’s limbs"
3887,CANTO XXV,The hideous monster intertwin’d his own.
3888,CANTO XXV,"Then, as they both had been of burning wax,"
3889,CANTO XXV,"Each melted into other, mingling hues,"
3890,CANTO XXV,That which was either now was seen no more.
3891,CANTO XXV,"Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,"
3892,CANTO XXV,"A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,"
3893,CANTO XXV,And the clean white expires. The other two
3894,CANTO XXV,"Look’d on exclaiming: “Ah, how dost thou change,"
3895,CANTO XXV,"Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,"
3896,CANTO XXV,Nor only one.” The two heads now became
3897,CANTO XXV,"One, and two figures blended in one form"
3898,CANTO XXV,"Appear’d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths"
3899,CANTO XXV,Two arms were made: the belly and the chest
3900,CANTO XXV,"The thighs and legs into such members chang’d,"
3901,CANTO XXV,As never eye hath seen. Of former shape
3902,CANTO XXV,All trace was vanish’d. Two yet neither seem’d
3903,CANTO XXV,"That image miscreate, and so pass’d on"
3904,CANTO XXV,With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge
3905,CANTO XXV,"Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,"
3906,CANTO XXV,"Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems"
3907,CANTO XXV,"A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,"
3908,CANTO XXV,So toward th’ entrails of the other two
3909,CANTO XXV,"Approaching seem’d, an adder all on fire,"
3910,CANTO XXV,"As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart."
3911,CANTO XXV,"In that part, whence our life is nourish’d first,"
3912,CANTO XXV,One he transpierc’d; then down before him fell
3913,CANTO XXV,Stretch’d out. The pierced spirit look’d on him
3914,CANTO XXV,"But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn’d,"
3915,CANTO XXV,As if by sleep or fev’rous fit assail’d.
3916,CANTO XXV,"He ey’d the serpent, and the serpent him."
3917,CANTO XXV,"One from the wound, the other from the mouth"
3918,CANTO XXV,"Breath’d a thick smoke, whose vap’ry columns join’d."
3919,CANTO XXV,
3920,CANTO XXV,"Lucan in mute attention now may hear,"
3921,CANTO XXV,"Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,"
3922,CANTO XXV,"Nor shine, Nasidius! Ovid now be mute."
3923,CANTO XXV,What if in warbling fiction he record
3924,CANTO XXV,"Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake"
3925,CANTO XXV,"Him chang’d, and her into a fountain clear,"
3926,CANTO XXV,I envy not; for never face to face
3927,CANTO XXV,"Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,"
3928,CANTO XXV,Wherein both shapes were ready to assume
3929,CANTO XXV,The other’s substance. They in mutual guise
3930,CANTO XXV,"So answer’d, that the serpent split his train"
3931,CANTO XXV,"Divided to a fork, and the pierc’d spirit"
3932,CANTO XXV,"Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs"
3933,CANTO XXV,"Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon"
3934,CANTO XXV,Was visible: the tail disparted took
3935,CANTO XXV,"The figure which the spirit lost, its skin"
3936,CANTO XXV,"Soft’ning, his indurated to a rind."
3937,CANTO XXV,"The shoulders next I mark’d, that ent’ring join’d"
3938,CANTO XXV,"The monster’s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet"
3939,CANTO XXV,"So lengthen’d, as the other’s dwindling shrunk."
3940,CANTO XXV,The feet behind then twisting up became
3941,CANTO XXV,"That part that man conceals, which in the wretch"
3942,CANTO XXV,Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke
3943,CANTO XXV,"With a new colour veils, and generates"
3944,CANTO XXV,"Th’ excrescent pile on one, peeling it off"
3945,CANTO XXV,"From th’ other body, lo! upon his feet"
3946,CANTO XXV,"One upright rose, and prone the other fell."
3947,CANTO XXV,Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps
3948,CANTO XXV,"Were shifted, though each feature chang’d beneath."
3949,CANTO XXV,"Of him who stood erect, the mounting face"
3950,CANTO XXV,"Retreated towards the temples, and what there"
3951,CANTO XXV,"Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears"
3952,CANTO XXV,"From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg’d,"
3953,CANTO XXV,Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell’d
3954,CANTO XXV,Into due size protuberant the lips.
3955,CANTO XXV,"He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends"
3956,CANTO XXV,"His sharpen’d visage, and draws down the ears"
3957,CANTO XXV,"Into the head, as doth the slug his horns."
3958,CANTO XXV,His tongue continuous before and apt
3959,CANTO XXV,"For utt’rance, severs; and the other’s fork"
3960,CANTO XXV,Closing unites. That done the smoke was laid.
3961,CANTO XXV,"The soul, transform’d into the brute, glides off,"
3962,CANTO XXV,"Hissing along the vale, and after him"
3963,CANTO XXV,The other talking sputters; but soon turn’d
3964,CANTO XXV,"His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few"
3965,CANTO XXV,Thus to another spake: “Along this path
3966,CANTO XXV,"Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!”"
3967,CANTO XXV,
3968,CANTO XXV,So saw I fluctuate in successive change
3969,CANTO XXV,Th’ unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:
3970,CANTO XXV,"And here if aught my tongue have swerv’d, events"
3971,CANTO XXV,So strange may be its warrant. O’er mine eyes
3972,CANTO XXV,"Confusion hung, and on my thoughts amaze."
3973,CANTO XXV,
3974,CANTO XXV,"Yet ’scap’d they not so covertly, but well"
3975,CANTO XXV,I mark’d Sciancato: he alone it was
3976,CANTO XXV,"Of the three first that came, who chang’d not: thou,"
3977,CANTO XXV,"The other’s fate, Gaville, still dost rue."
3978,CANTO XXV,
3979,CANTO XXV,
3980,CANTO XXV,
3981,CANTO XXV,
3982,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
3983,CANTO XXVI,
3984,CANTO XXVI,
3985,CANTO XXVI,Florence exult! for thou so mightily
3986,CANTO XXVI,"Hast thriven, that o’er land and sea thy wings"
3987,CANTO XXVI,"Thou beatest, and thy name spreads over hell!"
3988,CANTO XXVI,Among the plund’rers such the three I found
3989,CANTO XXVI,"Thy citizens, whence shame to me thy son,"
3990,CANTO XXVI,And no proud honour to thyself redounds.
3991,CANTO XXVI,
3992,CANTO XXVI,"But if our minds, when dreaming near the dawn,"
3993,CANTO XXVI,"Are of the truth presageful, thou ere long"
3994,CANTO XXVI,"Shalt feel what Prato, (not to say the rest)"
3995,CANTO XXVI,Would fain might come upon thee; and that chance
3996,CANTO XXVI,"Were in good time, if it befell thee now."
3997,CANTO XXVI,"Would so it were, since it must needs befall!"
3998,CANTO XXVI,"For as time wears me, I shall grieve the more."
3999,CANTO XXVI,
4000,CANTO XXVI,We from the depth departed; and my guide
4001,CANTO XXVI,"Remounting scal’d the flinty steps, which late"
4002,CANTO XXVI,"We downward trac’d, and drew me up the steep."
4003,CANTO XXVI,Pursuing thus our solitary way
4004,CANTO XXVI,"Among the crags and splinters of the rock,"
4005,CANTO XXVI,Sped not our feet without the help of hands.
4006,CANTO XXVI,
4007,CANTO XXVI,"Then sorrow seiz’d me, which e’en now revives,"
4008,CANTO XXVI,"As my thought turns again to what I saw,"
4009,CANTO XXVI,"And, more than I am wont, I rein and curb"
4010,CANTO XXVI,"The powers of nature in me, lest they run"
4011,CANTO XXVI,Where Virtue guides not; that if aught of good
4012,CANTO XXVI,"My gentle star, or something better gave me,"
4013,CANTO XXVI,I envy not myself the precious boon.
4014,CANTO XXVI,
4015,CANTO XXVI,"As in that season, when the sun least veils"
4016,CANTO XXVI,"His face that lightens all, what time the fly"
4017,CANTO XXVI,"Gives way to the shrill gnat, the peasant then"
4018,CANTO XXVI,"Upon some cliff reclin’d, beneath him sees"
4019,CANTO XXVI,"Fire-flies innumerous spangling o’er the vale,"
4020,CANTO XXVI,"Vineyard or tilth, where his day-labour lies:"
4021,CANTO XXVI,With flames so numberless throughout its space
4022,CANTO XXVI,"Shone the eighth chasm, apparent, when the depth"
4023,CANTO XXVI,"Was to my view expos’d. As he, whose wrongs"
4024,CANTO XXVI,"The bears aveng’d, at its departure saw"
4025,CANTO XXVI,"Elijah’s chariot, when the steeds erect"
4026,CANTO XXVI,"Rais’d their steep flight for heav’n; his eyes meanwhile,"
4027,CANTO XXVI,"Straining pursu’d them, till the flame alone"
4028,CANTO XXVI,Upsoaring like a misty speck he kenn’d;
4029,CANTO XXVI,"E’en thus along the gulf moves every flame,"
4030,CANTO XXVI,"A sinner so enfolded close in each,"
4031,CANTO XXVI,That none exhibits token of the theft.
4032,CANTO XXVI,
4033,CANTO XXVI,"Upon the bridge I forward bent to look,"
4034,CANTO XXVI,"And grasp’d a flinty mass, or else had fall’n,"
4035,CANTO XXVI,"Though push’d not from the height. The guide, who mark d"
4036,CANTO XXVI,"How I did gaze attentive, thus began:"
4037,CANTO XXVI,"“Within these ardours are the spirits, each"
4038,CANTO XXVI,"Swath’d in confining fire.”—“Master, thy word,”"
4039,CANTO XXVI,"I answer’d, “hath assur’d me; yet I deem’d"
4040,CANTO XXVI,"Already of the truth, already wish’d"
4041,CANTO XXVI,"To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes"
4042,CANTO XXVI,"So parted at the summit, as it seem’d"
4043,CANTO XXVI,"Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay"
4044,CANTO XXVI,The Theban brothers?” He replied: “Within
4045,CANTO XXVI,Ulysses there and Diomede endure
4046,CANTO XXVI,"Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now"
4047,CANTO XXVI,"Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath."
4048,CANTO XXVI,These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore
4049,CANTO XXVI,"The ambush of the horse, that open’d wide"
4050,CANTO XXVI,"A portal for that goodly seed to pass,"
4051,CANTO XXVI,Which sow’d imperial Rome; nor less the guile
4052,CANTO XXVI,"Lament they, whence of her Achilles ’reft"
4053,CANTO XXVI,Deidamia yet in death complains.
4054,CANTO XXVI,"And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy"
4055,CANTO XXVI,Of her Palladium spoil’d.”—“If they have power
4056,CANTO XXVI,"Of utt’rance from within these sparks,” said I,"
4057,CANTO XXVI,“O master! think my prayer a thousand fold
4058,CANTO XXVI,"In repetition urg’d, that thou vouchsafe"
4059,CANTO XXVI,"To pause, till here the horned flame arrive."
4060,CANTO XXVI,"See, how toward it with desire I bend.”"
4061,CANTO XXVI,
4062,CANTO XXVI,"He thus: “Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,"
4063,CANTO XXVI,And I accept it therefore: but do thou
4064,CANTO XXVI,"Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,"
4065,CANTO XXVI,"For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,"
4066,CANTO XXVI,"For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.”"
4067,CANTO XXVI,
4068,CANTO XXVI,"When there the flame had come, where time and place"
4069,CANTO XXVI,"Seem’d fitting to my guide, he thus began:"
4070,CANTO XXVI,"“O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!"
4071,CANTO XXVI,"If living I of you did merit aught,"
4072,CANTO XXVI,"Whate’er the measure were of that desert,"
4073,CANTO XXVI,"When in the world my lofty strain I pour’d,"
4074,CANTO XXVI,"Move ye not on, till one of you unfold"
4075,CANTO XXVI,In what clime death o’ertook him self-destroy’d.”
4076,CANTO XXVI,
4077,CANTO XXVI,Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn
4078,CANTO XXVI,"Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire"
4079,CANTO XXVI,"That labours with the wind, then to and fro"
4080,CANTO XXVI,"Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,"
4081,CANTO XXVI,"Threw out its voice, and spake: “When I escap’d"
4082,CANTO XXVI,"From Circe, who beyond a circling year"
4083,CANTO XXVI,"Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,"
4084,CANTO XXVI,"Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam’d the shore,"
4085,CANTO XXVI,"Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence"
4086,CANTO XXVI,"Of my old father, nor return of love,"
4087,CANTO XXVI,"That should have crown’d Penelope with joy,"
4088,CANTO XXVI,Could overcome in me the zeal I had
4089,CANTO XXVI,"T’ explore the world, and search the ways of life,"
4090,CANTO XXVI,Man’s evil and his virtue. Forth I sail’d
4091,CANTO XXVI,"Into the deep illimitable main,"
4092,CANTO XXVI,"With but one bark, and the small faithful band"
4093,CANTO XXVI,"That yet cleav’d to me. As Iberia far,"
4094,CANTO XXVI,"Far as Morocco either shore I saw,"
4095,CANTO XXVI,And the Sardinian and each isle beside
4096,CANTO XXVI,Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age
4097,CANTO XXVI,"Were I and my companions, when we came"
4098,CANTO XXVI,"To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain’d"
4099,CANTO XXVI,The bound’ries not to be o’erstepp’d by man.
4100,CANTO XXVI,"The walls of Seville to my right I left,"
4101,CANTO XXVI,On the’ other hand already Ceuta past.
4102,CANTO XXVI,"“O brothers!” I began, “who to the west"
4103,CANTO XXVI,"Through perils without number now have reach’d,"
4104,CANTO XXVI,"To this the short remaining watch, that yet"
4105,CANTO XXVI,"Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof"
4106,CANTO XXVI,"Of the unpeopled world, following the track"
4107,CANTO XXVI,Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:
4108,CANTO XXVI,Ye were not form’d to live the life of brutes
4109,CANTO XXVI,But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.
4110,CANTO XXVI,With these few words I sharpen’d for the voyage
4111,CANTO XXVI,"The mind of my associates, that I then"
4112,CANTO XXVI,Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn
4113,CANTO XXVI,"Our poop we turn’d, and for the witless flight"
4114,CANTO XXVI,"Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left."
4115,CANTO XXVI,"Each star of the’ other pole night now beheld,"
4116,CANTO XXVI,"And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor"
4117,CANTO XXVI,"It rose not. Five times re-illum’d, as oft"
4118,CANTO XXVI,Vanish’d the light from underneath the moon
4119,CANTO XXVI,"Since the deep way we enter’d, when from far"
4120,CANTO XXVI,"Appear’d a mountain dim, loftiest methought"
4121,CANTO XXVI,"Of all I e’er beheld. Joy seiz’d us straight,"
4122,CANTO XXVI,But soon to mourning changed. From the new land
4123,CANTO XXVI,"A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side"
4124,CANTO XXVI,Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl’d her round
4125,CANTO XXVI,"With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up"
4126,CANTO XXVI,"The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:"
4127,CANTO XXVI,And over us the booming billow clos’d.”
4128,CANTO XXVI,
4129,CANTO XXVI,
4130,CANTO XXVI,
4131,CANTO XXVI,
4132,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
4133,CANTO XXVII,
4134,CANTO XXVII,
4135,CANTO XXVII,"Now upward rose the flame, and still’d its light"
4136,CANTO XXVII,"To speak no more, and now pass’d on with leave"
4137,CANTO XXVII,"From the mild poet gain’d, when following came"
4138,CANTO XXVII,"Another, from whose top a sound confus’d,"
4139,CANTO XXVII,"Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look."
4140,CANTO XXVII,
4141,CANTO XXVII,"As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully"
4142,CANTO XXVII,"His cries first echoed, who had shap’d its mould,"
4143,CANTO XXVII,"Did so rebellow, with the voice of him"
4144,CANTO XXVII,"Tormented, that the brazen monster seem’d"
4145,CANTO XXVII,Pierc’d through with pain; thus while no way they found
4146,CANTO XXVII,"Nor avenue immediate through the flame,"
4147,CANTO XXVII,Into its language turn’d the dismal words:
4148,CANTO XXVII,"But soon as they had won their passage forth,"
4149,CANTO XXVII,"Up from the point, which vibrating obey’d"
4150,CANTO XXVII,"Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:"
4151,CANTO XXVII,“O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!
4152,CANTO XXVII,"That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,"
4153,CANTO XXVII,
4154,CANTO XXVII,"Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,’"
4155,CANTO XXVII,Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive
4156,CANTO XXVII,"Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,"
4157,CANTO XXVII,And with me parley: lo! it irks not me
4158,CANTO XXVII,And yet I burn. If but e’en now thou fall
4159,CANTO XXVII,"into this blind world, from that pleasant land"
4160,CANTO XXVII,"Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,"
4161,CANTO XXVII,"Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,"
4162,CANTO XXVII,Have peace or war. For of the mountains there
4163,CANTO XXVII,"Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,"
4164,CANTO XXVII,Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.”
4165,CANTO XXVII,
4166,CANTO XXVII,"Leaning I listen’d yet with heedful ear,"
4167,CANTO XXVII,"When, as he touch’d my side, the leader thus:"
4168,CANTO XXVII,“Speak thou: he is a Latian.” My reply
4169,CANTO XXVII,"Was ready, and I spake without delay:"
4170,CANTO XXVII,
4171,CANTO XXVII,“O spirit! who art hidden here below!
4172,CANTO XXVII,Never was thy Romagna without war
4173,CANTO XXVII,"In her proud tyrants’ bosoms, nor is now:"
4174,CANTO XXVII,"But open war there left I none. The state,"
4175,CANTO XXVII,"Ravenna hath maintain’d this many a year,"
4176,CANTO XXVII,"Is steadfast. There Polenta’s eagle broods,"
4177,CANTO XXVII,And in his broad circumference of plume
4178,CANTO XXVII,O’ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp
4179,CANTO XXVII,"The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,"
4180,CANTO XXVII,And pil’d in bloody heap the host of France.
4181,CANTO XXVII,
4182,CANTO XXVII,"“The’ old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,"
4183,CANTO XXVII,"That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,"
4184,CANTO XXVII,"Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs."
4185,CANTO XXVII,
4186,CANTO XXVII,“Lamone’s city and Santerno’s range
4187,CANTO XXVII,Under the lion of the snowy lair.
4188,CANTO XXVII,"Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,"
4189,CANTO XXVII,Or ever summer yields to winter’s frost.
4190,CANTO XXVII,"And she, whose flank is wash’d of Savio’s wave,"
4191,CANTO XXVII,"As ’twixt the level and the steep she lies,"
4192,CANTO XXVII,Lives so ’twixt tyrant power and liberty.
4193,CANTO XXVII,
4194,CANTO XXVII,"“Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?"
4195,CANTO XXVII,"Be not more hard than others. In the world,"
4196,CANTO XXVII,So may thy name still rear its forehead high.”
4197,CANTO XXVII,
4198,CANTO XXVII,"Then roar’d awhile the fire, its sharpen’d point"
4199,CANTO XXVII,"On either side wav’d, and thus breath’d at last:"
4200,CANTO XXVII,"“If I did think, my answer were to one,"
4201,CANTO XXVII,"Who ever could return unto the world,"
4202,CANTO XXVII,"This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne’er,"
4203,CANTO XXVII,"If true be told me, any from this depth"
4204,CANTO XXVII,"Has found his upward way, I answer thee,"
4205,CANTO XXVII,Nor fear lest infamy record the words.
4206,CANTO XXVII,
4207,CANTO XXVII,"“A man of arms at first, I cloth’d me then"
4208,CANTO XXVII,"In good Saint Francis’ girdle, hoping so"
4209,CANTO XXVII,T’ have made amends. And certainly my hope
4210,CANTO XXVII,"Had fail’d not, but that he, whom curses light on,"
4211,CANTO XXVII,The’ high priest again seduc’d me into sin.
4212,CANTO XXVII,And how and wherefore listen while I tell.
4213,CANTO XXVII,Long as this spirit mov’d the bones and pulp
4214,CANTO XXVII,"My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake"
4215,CANTO XXVII,The nature of the lion than the fox.
4216,CANTO XXVII,"All ways of winding subtlety I knew,"
4217,CANTO XXVII,"And with such art conducted, that the sound"
4218,CANTO XXVII,Reach’d the world’s limit. Soon as to that part
4219,CANTO XXVII,"Of life I found me come, when each behoves"
4220,CANTO XXVII,To lower sails and gather in the lines;
4221,CANTO XXVII,"That which before had pleased me then I rued,"
4222,CANTO XXVII,And to repentance and confession turn’d;
4223,CANTO XXVII,Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!
4224,CANTO XXVII,"The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,"
4225,CANTO XXVII,"Waging his warfare near the Lateran,"
4226,CANTO XXVII,Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes
4227,CANTO XXVII,"All Christians were, nor against Acre one"
4228,CANTO XXVII,"Had fought, nor traffic’d in the Soldan’s land),"
4229,CANTO XXVII,He his great charge nor sacred ministry
4230,CANTO XXVII,"In himself, rev’renc’d, nor in me that cord,"
4231,CANTO XXVII,Which us’d to mark with leanness whom it girded.
4232,CANTO XXVII,"As in Socrate, Constantine besought"
4233,CANTO XXVII,"To cure his leprosy Sylvester’s aid,"
4234,CANTO XXVII,So me to cure the fever of his pride
4235,CANTO XXVII,This man besought: my counsel to that end
4236,CANTO XXVII,He ask’d: and I was silent: for his words
4237,CANTO XXVII,Seem’d drunken: but forthwith he thus resum’d:
4238,CANTO XXVII,“From thy heart banish fear: of all offence
4239,CANTO XXVII,"I hitherto absolve thee. In return,"
4240,CANTO XXVII,"Teach me my purpose so to execute,"
4241,CANTO XXVII,That Penestrino cumber earth no more.
4242,CANTO XXVII,"Heav’n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut"
4243,CANTO XXVII,"And open: and the keys are therefore twain,"
4244,CANTO XXVII,The which my predecessor meanly priz’d.”
4245,CANTO XXVII,
4246,CANTO XXVII,"Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,"
4247,CANTO XXVII,"Of silence as more perilous I deem’d,"
4248,CANTO XXVII,And answer’d: “Father! since thou washest me
4249,CANTO XXVII,"Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,"
4250,CANTO XXVII,"Large promise with performance scant, be sure,"
4251,CANTO XXVII,Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.”
4252,CANTO XXVII,
4253,CANTO XXVII,"“When I was number’d with the dead, then came"
4254,CANTO XXVII,Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark
4255,CANTO XXVII,"He met, who cried: “‘Wrong me not; he is mine,"
4256,CANTO XXVII,"And must below to join the wretched crew,"
4257,CANTO XXVII,For the deceitful counsel which he gave.
4258,CANTO XXVII,"E’er since I watch’d him, hov’ring at his hair,"
4259,CANTO XXVII,No power can the impenitent absolve;
4260,CANTO XXVII,"Nor to repent and will at once consist,"
4261,CANTO XXVII,By contradiction absolute forbid.”
4262,CANTO XXVII,"Oh mis’ry! how I shook myself, when he"
4263,CANTO XXVII,"Seiz’d me, and cried, “Thou haply thought’st me not"
4264,CANTO XXVII,A disputant in logic so exact.”
4265,CANTO XXVII,"To Minos down he bore me, and the judge"
4266,CANTO XXVII,"Twin’d eight times round his callous back the tail,"
4267,CANTO XXVII,"Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:"
4268,CANTO XXVII,"“This is a guilty soul, that in the fire"
4269,CANTO XXVII,Must vanish.’ Hence perdition-doom’d I rove
4270,CANTO XXVII,A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.”
4271,CANTO XXVII,
4272,CANTO XXVII,"When he had thus fulfill’d his words, the flame"
4273,CANTO XXVII,"In dolour parted, beating to and fro,"
4274,CANTO XXVII,"And writhing its sharp horn. We onward went,"
4275,CANTO XXVII,"I and my leader, up along the rock,"
4276,CANTO XXVII,"Far as another arch, that overhangs"
4277,CANTO XXVII,"The foss, wherein the penalty is paid"
4278,CANTO XXVII,"Of those, who load them with committed sin."
4279,CANTO XXVII,
4280,CANTO XXVII,
4281,CANTO XXVII,
4282,CANTO XXVII,
4283,CANTO XXVIII,CANTO XXVIII
4284,CANTO XXVIII,
4285,CANTO XXVIII,
4286,CANTO XXVIII,"Who, e’en in words unfetter’d, might at full"
4287,CANTO XXVIII,"Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,"
4288,CANTO XXVIII,Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue
4289,CANTO XXVIII,"So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought"
4290,CANTO XXVIII,Both impotent alike. If in one band
4291,CANTO XXVIII,"Collected, stood the people all, who e’er"
4292,CANTO XXVIII,"Pour’d on Apulia’s happy soil their blood,"
4293,CANTO XXVIII,"Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war"
4294,CANTO XXVIII,When of the rings the measur’d booty made
4295,CANTO XXVIII,"A pile so high, as Rome’s historian writes"
4296,CANTO XXVIII,"Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt"
4297,CANTO XXVIII,"The grinding force of Guiscard’s Norman steel,"
4298,CANTO XXVIII,"And those the rest, whose bones are gather’d yet"
4299,CANTO XXVIII,"At Ceperano, there where treachery"
4300,CANTO XXVIII,"Branded th’ Apulian name, or where beyond"
4301,CANTO XXVIII,"Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms"
4302,CANTO XXVIII,The old Alardo conquer’d; and his limbs
4303,CANTO XXVIII,"One were to show transpierc’d, another his"
4304,CANTO XXVIII,Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this
4305,CANTO XXVIII,"Were but a thing of nought, to the’ hideous sight"
4306,CANTO XXVIII,"Of the ninth chasm. A rundlet, that hath lost"
4307,CANTO XXVIII,"Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,"
4308,CANTO XXVIII,"As one I mark’d, torn from the chin throughout"
4309,CANTO XXVIII,Down to the hinder passage: ’twixt the legs
4310,CANTO XXVIII,"Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay"
4311,CANTO XXVIII,"Open to view, and wretched ventricle,"
4312,CANTO XXVIII,That turns th’ englutted aliment to dross.
4313,CANTO XXVIII,
4314,CANTO XXVIII,"Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,"
4315,CANTO XXVIII,"He ey’d me, with his hands laid his breast bare,"
4316,CANTO XXVIII,And cried; “Now mark how I do rip me! lo!
4317,CANTO XXVIII,How is Mohammed mangled! before me
4318,CANTO XXVIII,"Walks Ali weeping, from the chin his face"
4319,CANTO XXVIII,Cleft to the forelock; and the others all
4320,CANTO XXVIII,"Whom here thou seest, while they liv’d, did sow"
4321,CANTO XXVIII,"Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent."
4322,CANTO XXVIII,"A fiend is here behind, who with his sword"
4323,CANTO XXVIII,"Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again"
4324,CANTO XXVIII,"Each of this ream, when we have compast round"
4325,CANTO XXVIII,"The dismal way, for first our gashes close"
4326,CANTO XXVIII,Ere we repass before him. But say who
4327,CANTO XXVIII,"Art thou, that standest musing on the rock,"
4328,CANTO XXVIII,Haply so lingering to delay the pain
4329,CANTO XXVIII,"Sentenc’d upon thy crimes?”—“Him death not yet,”"
4330,CANTO XXVIII,"My guide rejoin’d, “hath overta’en, nor sin"
4331,CANTO XXVIII,"Conducts to torment; but, that he may make"
4332,CANTO XXVIII,"Full trial of your state, I who am dead"
4333,CANTO XXVIII,"Must through the depths of hell, from orb to orb,"
4334,CANTO XXVIII,"Conduct him. Trust my words, for they are true.”"
4335,CANTO XXVIII,
4336,CANTO XXVIII,"More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,"
4337,CANTO XXVIII,"Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,"
4338,CANTO XXVIII,"Forgetful of their pangs. “Thou, who perchance"
4339,CANTO XXVIII,"Shalt shortly view the sun, this warning thou"
4340,CANTO XXVIII,"Bear to Dolcino: bid him, if he wish not"
4341,CANTO XXVIII,"Here soon to follow me, that with good store"
4342,CANTO XXVIII,"Of food he arm him, lest impris’ning snows"
4343,CANTO XXVIII,"Yield him a victim to Novara’s power,"
4344,CANTO XXVIII,No easy conquest else.” With foot uprais’d
4345,CANTO XXVIII,"For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground"
4346,CANTO XXVIII,"Then fix’d it to depart. Another shade,"
4347,CANTO XXVIII,"Pierc’d in the throat, his nostrils mutilate"
4348,CANTO XXVIII,"E’en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear"
4349,CANTO XXVIII,"Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood"
4350,CANTO XXVIII,"Gazing, before the rest advanc’d, and bar’d"
4351,CANTO XXVIII,"His wind-pipe, that without was all o’ersmear’d"
4352,CANTO XXVIII,"With crimson stain. “O thou!” said ‘he, “whom sin"
4353,CANTO XXVIII,"Condemns not, and whom erst (unless too near"
4354,CANTO XXVIII,Resemblance do deceive me) I aloft
4355,CANTO XXVIII,"Have seen on Latian ground, call thou to mind"
4356,CANTO XXVIII,"Piero of Medicina, if again"
4357,CANTO XXVIII,"Returning, thou behold’st the pleasant land"
4358,CANTO XXVIII,That from Vercelli slopes to Mercabo;
4359,CANTO XXVIII,"And there instruct the twain, whom Fano boasts"
4360,CANTO XXVIII,"Her worthiest sons, Guido and Angelo,"
4361,CANTO XXVIII,That if ’tis giv’n us here to scan aright
4362,CANTO XXVIII,"The future, they out of life’s tenement"
4363,CANTO XXVIII,"Shall be cast forth, and whelm’d under the waves"
4364,CANTO XXVIII,"Near to Cattolica, through perfidy"
4365,CANTO XXVIII,Of a fell tyrant. ’Twixt the Cyprian isle
4366,CANTO XXVIII,"And Balearic, ne’er hath Neptune seen"
4367,CANTO XXVIII,"An injury so foul, by pirates done"
4368,CANTO XXVIII,Or Argive crew of old. That one-ey’d traitor
4369,CANTO XXVIII,(Whose realm there is a spirit here were fain
4370,CANTO XXVIII,His eye had still lack’d sight of) them shall bring
4371,CANTO XXVIII,"To conf’rence with him, then so shape his end,"
4372,CANTO XXVIII,That they shall need not ’gainst Focara’s wind
4373,CANTO XXVIII,Offer up vow nor pray’r.” I answering thus:
4374,CANTO XXVIII,
4375,CANTO XXVIII,"“Declare, as thou dost wish that I above"
4376,CANTO XXVIII,"May carry tidings of thee, who is he,"
4377,CANTO XXVIII,In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?”
4378,CANTO XXVIII,
4379,CANTO XXVIII,Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone
4380,CANTO XXVIII,"Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws"
4381,CANTO XXVIII,"Expanding, cried: “Lo! this is he I wot of;"
4382,CANTO XXVIII,He speaks not for himself: the outcast this
4383,CANTO XXVIII,"Who overwhelm’d the doubt in Caesar’s mind,"
4384,CANTO XXVIII,Affirming that delay to men prepar’d
4385,CANTO XXVIII,Was ever harmful. “Oh how terrified
4386,CANTO XXVIII,"Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut"
4387,CANTO XXVIII,"The tongue, which spake that hardy word. Then one"
4388,CANTO XXVIII,"Maim’d of each hand, uplifted in the gloom"
4389,CANTO XXVIII,"The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots"
4390,CANTO XXVIII,"Sullied his face, and cried: “‘Remember thee"
4391,CANTO XXVIII,"Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim’d,"
4392,CANTO XXVIII,"‘The deed once done there is an end,’ that prov’d"
4393,CANTO XXVIII,A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.”
4394,CANTO XXVIII,
4395,CANTO XXVIII,"I added: “Ay, and death to thine own tribe.”"
4396,CANTO XXVIII,
4397,CANTO XXVIII,"Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,"
4398,CANTO XXVIII,As one grief stung to madness. But I there
4399,CANTO XXVIII,"Still linger’d to behold the troop, and saw"
4400,CANTO XXVIII,"Things, such as I may fear without more proof"
4401,CANTO XXVIII,"To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,"
4402,CANTO XXVIII,"The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate"
4403,CANTO XXVIII,"Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within"
4404,CANTO XXVIII,And bids him on and fear not. Without doubt
4405,CANTO XXVIII,"I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,"
4406,CANTO XXVIII,"A headless trunk, that even as the rest"
4407,CANTO XXVIII,Of the sad flock pac’d onward. By the hair
4408,CANTO XXVIII,"It bore the sever’d member, lantern-wise"
4409,CANTO XXVIII,"Pendent in hand, which look’d at us and said,"
4410,CANTO XXVIII,"“Woe’s me!” The spirit lighted thus himself,"
4411,CANTO XXVIII,"And two there were in one, and one in two."
4412,CANTO XXVIII,How that may be he knows who ordereth so.
4413,CANTO XXVIII,
4414,CANTO XXVIII,"When at the bridge’s foot direct he stood,"
4415,CANTO XXVIII,"His arm aloft he rear’d, thrusting the head"
4416,CANTO XXVIII,"Full in our view, that nearer we might hear"
4417,CANTO XXVIII,"The words, which thus it utter’d: “Now behold"
4418,CANTO XXVIII,"This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go’st"
4419,CANTO XXVIII,To spy the dead; behold if any else
4420,CANTO XXVIII,Be terrible as this. And that on earth
4421,CANTO XXVIII,"Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I"
4422,CANTO XXVIII,"Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John"
4423,CANTO XXVIII,The counsel mischievous. Father and son
4424,CANTO XXVIII,I set at mutual war. For Absalom
4425,CANTO XXVIII,"And David more did not Ahitophel,"
4426,CANTO XXVIII,Spurring them on maliciously to strife.
4427,CANTO XXVIII,"For parting those so closely knit, my brain"
4428,CANTO XXVIII,"Parted, alas! I carry from its source,"
4429,CANTO XXVIII,That in this trunk inhabits. Thus the law
4430,CANTO XXVIII,Of retribution fiercely works in me.”
4431,CANTO XXVIII,
4432,CANTO XXVIII,
4433,CANTO XXVIII,
4434,CANTO XXVIII,
4435,CANTO XXIX,CANTO XXIX
4436,CANTO XXIX,
4437,CANTO XXIX,
4438,CANTO XXIX,So were mine eyes inebriate with view
4439,CANTO XXIX,"Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds"
4440,CANTO XXIX,"Disfigur’d, that they long’d to stay and weep."
4441,CANTO XXIX,
4442,CANTO XXIX,But Virgil rous’d me: “What yet gazest on?
4443,CANTO XXIX,Wherefore doth fasten yet thy sight below
4444,CANTO XXIX,Among the maim’d and miserable shades?
4445,CANTO XXIX,Thou hast not shewn in any chasm beside
4446,CANTO XXIX,"This weakness. Know, if thou wouldst number them"
4447,CANTO XXIX,That two and twenty miles the valley winds
4448,CANTO XXIX,"Its circuit, and already is the moon"
4449,CANTO XXIX,Beneath our feet: the time permitted now
4450,CANTO XXIX,"Is short, and more not seen remains to see.”"
4451,CANTO XXIX,
4452,CANTO XXIX,"“If thou,” I straight replied, “hadst weigh’d the cause"
4453,CANTO XXIX,"For which I look’d, thou hadst perchance excus’d"
4454,CANTO XXIX,The tarrying still.” My leader part pursu’d
4455,CANTO XXIX,"His way, the while I follow’d, answering him,"
4456,CANTO XXIX,"And adding thus: “Within that cave I deem,"
4457,CANTO XXIX,"Whereon so fixedly I held my ken,"
4458,CANTO XXIX,"There is a spirit dwells, one of my blood,"
4459,CANTO XXIX,Wailing the crime that costs him now so dear.”
4460,CANTO XXIX,
4461,CANTO XXIX,Then spake my master: “Let thy soul no more
4462,CANTO XXIX,Afflict itself for him. Direct elsewhere
4463,CANTO XXIX,"Its thought, and leave him. At the bridge’s foot"
4464,CANTO XXIX,I mark’d how he did point with menacing look
4465,CANTO XXIX,"At thee, and heard him by the others nam’d"
4466,CANTO XXIX,Geri of Bello. Thou so wholly then
4467,CANTO XXIX,"Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul’d"
4468,CANTO XXIX,"The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not"
4469,CANTO XXIX,"That way, ere he was gone.”—“O guide belov’d!"
4470,CANTO XXIX,"His violent death yet unaveng’d,” said I,"
4471,CANTO XXIX,"“By any, who are partners in his shame,"
4472,CANTO XXIX,"Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,"
4473,CANTO XXIX,He pass’d me speechless by; and doing so
4474,CANTO XXIX,Hath made me more compassionate his fate.”
4475,CANTO XXIX,
4476,CANTO XXIX,So we discours’d to where the rock first show’d
4477,CANTO XXIX,"The other valley, had more light been there,"
4478,CANTO XXIX,E’en to the lowest depth. Soon as we came
4479,CANTO XXIX,O’er the last cloister in the dismal rounds
4480,CANTO XXIX,"Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood"
4481,CANTO XXIX,"Were to our view expos’d, then many a dart"
4482,CANTO XXIX,"Of sore lament assail’d me, headed all"
4483,CANTO XXIX,"With points of thrilling pity, that I clos’d"
4484,CANTO XXIX,Both ears against the volley with mine hands.
4485,CANTO XXIX,
4486,CANTO XXIX,"As were the torment, if each lazar-house"
4487,CANTO XXIX,"Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time"
4488,CANTO XXIX,"’Twixt July and September, with the isle"
4489,CANTO XXIX,"Sardinia and Maremma’s pestilent fen,"
4490,CANTO XXIX,Had heap’d their maladies all in one foss
4491,CANTO XXIX,Together; such was here the torment: dire
4492,CANTO XXIX,"The stench, as issuing steams from fester’d limbs."
4493,CANTO XXIX,
4494,CANTO XXIX,We on the utmost shore of the long rock
4495,CANTO XXIX,Descended still to leftward. Then my sight
4496,CANTO XXIX,"Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein"
4497,CANTO XXIX,"The minister of the most mighty Lord,"
4498,CANTO XXIX,"All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment"
4499,CANTO XXIX,The forgers noted on her dread record.
4500,CANTO XXIX,
4501,CANTO XXIX,More rueful was it not methinks to see
4502,CANTO XXIX,"The nation in Aegina droop, what time"
4503,CANTO XXIX,"Each living thing, e’en to the little worm,"
4504,CANTO XXIX,"All fell, so full of malice was the air"
4505,CANTO XXIX,"(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,"
4506,CANTO XXIX,The ancient people were restor’d anew
4507,CANTO XXIX,From seed of emmets) than was here to see
4508,CANTO XXIX,"The spirits, that languish’d through the murky vale"
4509,CANTO XXIX,"Up-pil’d on many a stack. Confus’d they lay,"
4510,CANTO XXIX,"One o’er the belly, o’er the shoulders one"
4511,CANTO XXIX,Roll’d of another; sideling crawl’d a third
4512,CANTO XXIX,Along the dismal pathway. Step by step
4513,CANTO XXIX,"We journey’d on, in silence looking round"
4514,CANTO XXIX,"And list’ning those diseas’d, who strove in vain"
4515,CANTO XXIX,"To lift their forms. Then two I mark’d, that sat"
4516,CANTO XXIX,"Propp’d ’gainst each other, as two brazen pans"
4517,CANTO XXIX,"Set to retain the heat. From head to foot,"
4518,CANTO XXIX,A tetter bark’d them round. Nor saw I e’er
4519,CANTO XXIX,"Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord"
4520,CANTO XXIX,"Impatient waited, or himself perchance"
4521,CANTO XXIX,"Tir’d with long watching, as of these each one"
4522,CANTO XXIX,"Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness"
4523,CANTO XXIX,Of ne’er abated pruriency. The crust
4524,CANTO XXIX,"Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales"
4525,CANTO XXIX,Scrap’d from the bream or fish of broader mail.
4526,CANTO XXIX,
4527,CANTO XXIX,"“O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off"
4528,CANTO XXIX,"Thy coat of proof,” thus spake my guide to one,"
4529,CANTO XXIX,"“And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,"
4530,CANTO XXIX,Tell me if any born of Latian land
4531,CANTO XXIX,Be among these within: so may thy nails
4532,CANTO XXIX,Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.”
4533,CANTO XXIX,
4534,CANTO XXIX,"“Both are of Latium,” weeping he replied,"
4535,CANTO XXIX,“Whom tortur’d thus thou seest: but who art thou
4536,CANTO XXIX,That hast inquir’d of us?” To whom my guide:
4537,CANTO XXIX,"“One that descend with this man, who yet lives,"
4538,CANTO XXIX,"From rock to rock, and show him hell’s abyss.”"
4539,CANTO XXIX,
4540,CANTO XXIX,"Then started they asunder, and each turn’d"
4541,CANTO XXIX,"Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear"
4542,CANTO XXIX,Those words redounding struck. To me my liege
4543,CANTO XXIX,Address’d him: “Speak to them whate’er thou list.”
4544,CANTO XXIX,
4545,CANTO XXIX,And I therewith began: “So may no time
4546,CANTO XXIX,Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men
4547,CANTO XXIX,"In th’ upper world, but after many suns"
4548,CANTO XXIX,"Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,"
4549,CANTO XXIX,"And of what race ye come. Your punishment,"
4550,CANTO XXIX,"Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,"
4551,CANTO XXIX,Deter you not from opening thus much to me.”
4552,CANTO XXIX,
4553,CANTO XXIX,"“Arezzo was my dwelling,” answer’d one,"
4554,CANTO XXIX,“And me Albero of Sienna brought
4555,CANTO XXIX,"To die by fire; but that, for which I died,"
4556,CANTO XXIX,"Leads me not here. True is in sport I told him,"
4557,CANTO XXIX,That I had learn’d to wing my flight in air.
4558,CANTO XXIX,"And he admiring much, as he was void"
4559,CANTO XXIX,"Of wisdom, will’d me to declare to him"
4560,CANTO XXIX,"The secret of mine art: and only hence,"
4561,CANTO XXIX,"Because I made him not a Daedalus,"
4562,CANTO XXIX,Prevail’d on one suppos’d his sire to burn me.
4563,CANTO XXIX,"But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,"
4564,CANTO XXIX,"For that I practis’d alchemy on earth,"
4565,CANTO XXIX,Has doom’d me. Him no subterfuge eludes.”
4566,CANTO XXIX,
4567,CANTO XXIX,Then to the bard I spake: “Was ever race
4568,CANTO XXIX,Light as Sienna’s? Sure not France herself
4569,CANTO XXIX,Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain.”
4570,CANTO XXIX,
4571,CANTO XXIX,"The other leprous spirit heard my words,"
4572,CANTO XXIX,And thus return’d: “Be Stricca from this charge
4573,CANTO XXIX,"Exempted, he who knew so temp’rately"
4574,CANTO XXIX,To lay out fortune’s gifts; and Niccolo
4575,CANTO XXIX,Who first the spice’s costly luxury
4576,CANTO XXIX,"Discover’d in that garden, where such seed"
4577,CANTO XXIX,Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop
4578,CANTO XXIX,"Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano"
4579,CANTO XXIX,"Lavish’d his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,"
4580,CANTO XXIX,And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show’d
4581,CANTO XXIX,A spectacle for all. That thou mayst know
4582,CANTO XXIX,Who seconds thee against the Siennese
4583,CANTO XXIX,"Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen’d sight,"
4584,CANTO XXIX,That well my face may answer to thy ken;
4585,CANTO XXIX,"So shalt thou see I am Capocchio’s ghost,"
4586,CANTO XXIX,Who forg’d transmuted metals by the power
4587,CANTO XXIX,"Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,"
4588,CANTO XXIX,Thus needs must well remember how I aped
4589,CANTO XXIX,Creative nature by my subtle art.”

4594,CANTO XXX,CANTO XXX
4595,CANTO XXX,
4596,CANTO XXX,
4597,CANTO XXX,What time resentment burn’d in Juno’s breast
4598,CANTO XXX,"For Semele against the Theban blood,"
4599,CANTO XXX,"As more than once in dire mischance was rued,"
4600,CANTO XXX,"Such fatal frenzy seiz’d on Athamas,"
4601,CANTO XXX,That he his spouse beholding with a babe
4602,CANTO XXX,"Laden on either arm, “Spread out,” he cried,"
4603,CANTO XXX,"“The meshes, that I take the lioness"
4604,CANTO XXX,And the young lions at the pass: “then forth
4605,CANTO XXX,"Stretch’d he his merciless talons, grasping one,"
4606,CANTO XXX,"One helpless innocent, Learchus nam’d,"
4607,CANTO XXX,"Whom swinging down he dash’d upon a rock,"
4608,CANTO XXX,And with her other burden self-destroy’d
4609,CANTO XXX,The hapless mother plung’d: and when the pride
4610,CANTO XXX,"Of all-presuming Troy fell from its height,"
4611,CANTO XXX,"By fortune overwhelm’d, and the old king"
4612,CANTO XXX,"With his realm perish’d, then did Hecuba,"
4613,CANTO XXX,"A wretch forlorn and captive, when she saw"
4614,CANTO XXX,"Polyxena first slaughter’d, and her son,"
4615,CANTO XXX,"Her Polydorus, on the wild sea-beach"
4616,CANTO XXX,"Next met the mourner’s view, then reft of sense"
4617,CANTO XXX,Did she run barking even as a dog;
4618,CANTO XXX,Such mighty power had grief to wrench her soul.
4619,CANTO XXX,Bet ne’er the Furies or of Thebes or Troy
4620,CANTO XXX,"With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads"
4621,CANTO XXX,"Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,"
4622,CANTO XXX,As now two pale and naked ghost I saw
4623,CANTO XXX,"That gnarling wildly scamper’d, like the swine"
4624,CANTO XXX,"Excluded from his stye. One reach’d Capocchio,"
4625,CANTO XXX,"And in the neck-joint sticking deep his fangs,"
4626,CANTO XXX,"Dragg’d him, that o’er the solid pavement rubb’d"
4627,CANTO XXX,"His belly stretch’d out prone. The other shape,"
4628,CANTO XXX,"He of Arezzo, there left trembling, spake;"
4629,CANTO XXX,“That sprite of air is Schicchi; in like mood
4630,CANTO XXX,Of random mischief vent he still his spite.”
4631,CANTO XXX,
4632,CANTO XXX,"To whom I answ’ring: “Oh! as thou dost hope,"
4633,CANTO XXX,"The other may not flesh its jaws on thee,"
4634,CANTO XXX,"Be patient to inform us, who it is,"
4635,CANTO XXX,Ere it speed hence.”—” That is the ancient soul
4636,CANTO XXX,"Of wretched Myrrha,” he replied, “who burn’d"
4637,CANTO XXX,"With most unholy flame for her own sire,"
4638,CANTO XXX,"And a false shape assuming, so perform’d"
4639,CANTO XXX,"The deed of sin; e’en as the other there,"
4640,CANTO XXX,"That onward passes, dar’d to counterfeit"
4641,CANTO XXX,"Donati’s features, to feign’d testament"
4642,CANTO XXX,"The seal affixing, that himself might gain,"
4643,CANTO XXX,"For his own share, the lady of the herd.”"
4644,CANTO XXX,
4645,CANTO XXX,"When vanish’d the two furious shades, on whom"
4646,CANTO XXX,"Mine eye was held, I turn’d it back to view"
4647,CANTO XXX,The other cursed spirits. One I saw
4648,CANTO XXX,"In fashion like a lute, had but the groin"
4649,CANTO XXX,"Been sever’d, where it meets the forked part."
4650,CANTO XXX,"Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs"
4651,CANTO XXX,"With ill-converted moisture, that the paunch"
4652,CANTO XXX,"Suits not the visage, open’d wide his lips"
4653,CANTO XXX,"Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,"
4654,CANTO XXX,"One towards the chin, the other upward curl’d."
4655,CANTO XXX,
4656,CANTO XXX,"“O ye, who in this world of misery,"
4657,CANTO XXX,"Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,”"
4658,CANTO XXX,"Thus he began, “attentively regard"
4659,CANTO XXX,"Adamo’s woe. When living, full supply"
4660,CANTO XXX,Ne’er lack’d me of what most I coveted;
4661,CANTO XXX,"One drop of water now, alas! I crave."
4662,CANTO XXX,"The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes"
4663,CANTO XXX,"Of Casentino, making fresh and soft"
4664,CANTO XXX,"The banks whereby they glide to Arno’s stream,"
4665,CANTO XXX,Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;
4666,CANTO XXX,"For more the pictur’d semblance dries me up,"
4667,CANTO XXX,"Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh"
4668,CANTO XXX,"Desert these shrivel’d cheeks. So from the place,"
4669,CANTO XXX,"Where I transgress’d, stern justice urging me,"
4670,CANTO XXX,Takes means to quicken more my lab’ring sighs.
4671,CANTO XXX,"There is Romena, where I falsified"
4672,CANTO XXX,"The metal with the Baptist’s form imprest,"
4673,CANTO XXX,For which on earth I left my body burnt.
4674,CANTO XXX,But if I here might see the sorrowing soul
4675,CANTO XXX,"Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,"
4676,CANTO XXX,For Branda’s limpid spring I would not change
4677,CANTO XXX,"The welcome sight. One is e’en now within,"
4678,CANTO XXX,"If truly the mad spirits tell, that round"
4679,CANTO XXX,Are wand’ring. But wherein besteads me that?
4680,CANTO XXX,"My limbs are fetter’d. Were I but so light,"
4681,CANTO XXX,"That I each hundred years might move one inch,"
4682,CANTO XXX,"I had set forth already on this path,"
4683,CANTO XXX,"Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,"
4684,CANTO XXX,"Although eleven miles it wind, not more"
4685,CANTO XXX,Than half of one across. They brought me down
4686,CANTO XXX,Among this tribe; induc’d by them I stamp’d
4687,CANTO XXX,The florens with three carats of alloy.”
4688,CANTO XXX,
4689,CANTO XXX,"“Who are that abject pair,” I next inquir’d,"
4690,CANTO XXX,“That closely bounding thee upon thy right
4691,CANTO XXX,"Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep’d"
4692,CANTO XXX,"In the chill stream?”—“When to this gulf I dropt,”"
4693,CANTO XXX,"He answer’d, “here I found them; since that hour"
4694,CANTO XXX,"They have not turn’d, nor ever shall, I ween,"
4695,CANTO XXX,Till time hath run his course. One is that dame
4696,CANTO XXX,The false accuser of the Hebrew youth;
4697,CANTO XXX,"Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy."
4698,CANTO XXX,"Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,"
4699,CANTO XXX,"In such a cloud upsteam’d.” When that he heard,"
4700,CANTO XXX,"One, gall’d perchance to be so darkly nam’d,"
4701,CANTO XXX,"With clench’d hand smote him on the braced paunch,"
4702,CANTO XXX,That like a drum resounded: but forthwith
4703,CANTO XXX,"Adamo smote him on the face, the blow"
4704,CANTO XXX,"Returning with his arm, that seem’d as hard."
4705,CANTO XXX,
4706,CANTO XXX,“Though my o’erweighty limbs have ta’en from me
4707,CANTO XXX,"The power to move,” said he, “I have an arm"
4708,CANTO XXX,At liberty for such employ.” To whom
4709,CANTO XXX,"Was answer’d: “When thou wentest to the fire,"
4710,CANTO XXX,"Thou hadst it not so ready at command,"
4711,CANTO XXX,Then readier when it coin’d th’ impostor gold.”
4712,CANTO XXX,
4713,CANTO XXX,"And thus the dropsied: “Ay, now speak’st thou true."
4714,CANTO XXX,"But there thou gav’st not such true testimony,"
4715,CANTO XXX,"When thou wast question’d of the truth, at Troy.”"
4716,CANTO XXX,
4717,CANTO XXX,"“If I spake false, thou falsely stamp’dst the coin,”"
4718,CANTO XXX,"Said Sinon; “I am here but for one fault,"
4719,CANTO XXX,And thou for more than any imp beside.”
4720,CANTO XXX,
4721,CANTO XXX,"“Remember,” he replied, “O perjur’d one,"
4722,CANTO XXX,"The horse remember, that did teem with death,"
4723,CANTO XXX,And all the world be witness to thy guilt.”
4724,CANTO XXX,
4725,CANTO XXX,"“To thine,” return’d the Greek, “witness the thirst"
4726,CANTO XXX,"Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,"
4727,CANTO XXX,"Rear’d by thy belly up before thine eyes,"
4728,CANTO XXX,A mass corrupt.” To whom the coiner thus:
4729,CANTO XXX,“Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass
4730,CANTO XXX,"Its evil saying. Me if thirst assails,"
4731,CANTO XXX,"Yet I am stuff’d with moisture. Thou art parch’d,"
4732,CANTO XXX,"Pains rack thy head, no urging would’st thou need"
4733,CANTO XXX,To make thee lap Narcissus’ mirror up.”
4734,CANTO XXX,
4735,CANTO XXX,"I was all fix’d to listen, when my guide"
4736,CANTO XXX,Admonish’d: “Now beware: a little more.
4737,CANTO XXX,And I do quarrel with thee.” I perceiv’d
4738,CANTO XXX,"How angrily he spake, and towards him turn’d"
4739,CANTO XXX,"With shame so poignant, as remember’d yet"
4740,CANTO XXX,Confounds me. As a man that dreams of harm
4741,CANTO XXX,"Befall’n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,"
4742,CANTO XXX,"And that which is, desires as if it were not,"
4743,CANTO XXX,"Such then was I, who wanting power to speak"
4744,CANTO XXX,"Wish’d to excuse myself, and all the while"
4745,CANTO XXX,"Excus’d me, though unweeting that I did."
4746,CANTO XXX,
4747,CANTO XXX,"“More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,”"
4748,CANTO XXX,"My master cried, “might expiate. Therefore cast"
4749,CANTO XXX,All sorrow from thy soul; and if again
4750,CANTO XXX,"Chance bring thee, where like conference is held,"
4751,CANTO XXX,Think I am ever at thy side. To hear
4752,CANTO XXX,Such wrangling is a joy for vulgar minds.”
4753,CANTO XXX,
4754,CANTO XXX,
4755,CANTO XXX,
4756,CANTO XXX,
4757,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
4758,CANTO XXXI,
4759,CANTO XXXI,
4760,CANTO XXXI,"The very tongue, whose keen reproof before"
4761,CANTO XXXI,"Had wounded me, that either cheek was stain’d,"
4762,CANTO XXXI,"Now minister’d my cure. So have I heard,"
4763,CANTO XXXI,Achilles and his father’s javelin caus’d
4764,CANTO XXXI,"Pain first, and then the boon of health restor’d."
4765,CANTO XXXI,
4766,CANTO XXXI,"Turning our back upon the vale of woe,"
4767,CANTO XXXI,W cross’d th’ encircled mound in silence. There
4768,CANTO XXXI,"Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom"
4769,CANTO XXXI,Mine eye advanc’d not: but I heard a horn
4770,CANTO XXXI,Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made
4771,CANTO XXXI,The thunder feeble. Following its course
4772,CANTO XXXI,"The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent"
4773,CANTO XXXI,On that one spot. So terrible a blast
4774,CANTO XXXI,"Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout"
4775,CANTO XXXI,"O’erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench’d"
4776,CANTO XXXI,His saintly warfare. Thitherward not long
4777,CANTO XXXI,"My head was rais’d, when many lofty towers"
4778,CANTO XXXI,"Methought I spied. “Master,” said I, “what land"
4779,CANTO XXXI,Is this?” He answer’d straight: “Too long a space
4780,CANTO XXXI,Of intervening darkness has thine eye
4781,CANTO XXXI,To traverse: thou hast therefore widely err’d
4782,CANTO XXXI,In thy imagining. Thither arriv’d
4783,CANTO XXXI,"Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude"
4784,CANTO XXXI,The sense. A little therefore urge thee on.”
4785,CANTO XXXI,
4786,CANTO XXXI,Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;
4787,CANTO XXXI,"“Yet know,” said he, “ere farther we advance,"
4788,CANTO XXXI,"That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,"
4789,CANTO XXXI,"But giants. In the pit they stand immers’d,"
4790,CANTO XXXI,"Each from his navel downward, round the bank.”"
4791,CANTO XXXI,
4792,CANTO XXXI,"As when a fog disperseth gradually,"
4793,CANTO XXXI,Our vision traces what the mist involves
4794,CANTO XXXI,Condens’d in air; so piercing through the gross
4795,CANTO XXXI,"And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more"
4796,CANTO XXXI,"We near’d toward the brink, mine error fled,"
4797,CANTO XXXI,And fear came o’er me. As with circling round
4798,CANTO XXXI,"Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,"
4799,CANTO XXXI,"E’en thus the shore, encompassing th’ abyss,"
4800,CANTO XXXI,"Was turreted with giants, half their length"
4801,CANTO XXXI,"Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav’n"
4802,CANTO XXXI,"Yet threatens, when his mutt’ring thunder rolls."
4803,CANTO XXXI,
4804,CANTO XXXI,"Of one already I descried the face,"
4805,CANTO XXXI,"Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge"
4806,CANTO XXXI,"Great part, and both arms down along his ribs."
4807,CANTO XXXI,
4808,CANTO XXXI,"All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand"
4809,CANTO XXXI,"Left framing of these monsters, did display"
4810,CANTO XXXI,"Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War"
4811,CANTO XXXI,Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she
4812,CANTO XXXI,"Repent her not of th’ elephant and whale,"
4813,CANTO XXXI,Who ponders well confesses her therein
4814,CANTO XXXI,Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force
4815,CANTO XXXI,"And evil will are back’d with subtlety,"
4816,CANTO XXXI,Resistance none avails. His visage seem’d
4817,CANTO XXXI,"In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops"
4818,CANTO XXXI,Saint Peter’s Roman fane; and th’ other bones
4819,CANTO XXXI,"Of like proportion, so that from above"
4820,CANTO XXXI,"The bank, which girdled him below, such height"
4821,CANTO XXXI,"Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders"
4822,CANTO XXXI,Had striv’n in vain to reach but to his hair.
4823,CANTO XXXI,Full thirty ample palms was he expos’d
4824,CANTO XXXI,Downward from whence a man his garments loops.
4825,CANTO XXXI,"“Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,”"
4826,CANTO XXXI,"So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns"
4827,CANTO XXXI,Became not; and my guide address’d him thus:
4828,CANTO XXXI,“O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee
4829,CANTO XXXI,"Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage"
4830,CANTO XXXI,"Or other passion wring thee. Search thy neck,"
4831,CANTO XXXI,There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.
4832,CANTO XXXI,"Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast"
4833,CANTO XXXI,Where hangs the baldrick!” Then to me he spake:
4834,CANTO XXXI,"“He doth accuse himself. Nimrod is this,"
4835,CANTO XXXI,Through whose ill counsel in the world no more
4836,CANTO XXXI,"One tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste"
4837,CANTO XXXI,"Our words; for so each language is to him,"
4838,CANTO XXXI,"As his to others, understood by none.”"
4839,CANTO XXXI,
4840,CANTO XXXI,"Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,"
4841,CANTO XXXI,And at a sling’s throw found another shade
4842,CANTO XXXI,Far fiercer and more huge. I cannot say
4843,CANTO XXXI,What master hand had girt him; but he held
4844,CANTO XXXI,"Behind the right arm fetter’d, and before"
4845,CANTO XXXI,"The other with a chain, that fasten’d him"
4846,CANTO XXXI,"From the neck down, and five times round his form"
4847,CANTO XXXI,Apparent met the wreathed links. “This proud one
4848,CANTO XXXI,Would of his strength against almighty Jove
4849,CANTO XXXI,"Make trial,” said my guide; “whence he is thus"
4850,CANTO XXXI,Requited: Ephialtes him they call.
4851,CANTO XXXI,"Great was his prowess, when the giants brought"
4852,CANTO XXXI,"Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,"
4853,CANTO XXXI,Now moves he never.” Forthwith I return’d:
4854,CANTO XXXI,"“Fain would I, if ’twere possible, mine eyes"
4855,CANTO XXXI,Of Briareus immeasurable gain’d
4856,CANTO XXXI,Experience next.” He answer’d: “Thou shalt see
4857,CANTO XXXI,"Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks"
4858,CANTO XXXI,"And is unfetter’d, who shall place us there"
4859,CANTO XXXI,Where guilt is at its depth. Far onward stands
4860,CANTO XXXI,"Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made"
4861,CANTO XXXI,"Like to this spirit, save that in his looks"
4862,CANTO XXXI,More fell he seems.” By violent earthquake rock’d
4863,CANTO XXXI,"Ne’er shook a tow’r, so reeling to its base,"
4864,CANTO XXXI,As Ephialtes. More than ever then
4865,CANTO XXXI,"I dreaded death, nor than the terror more"
4866,CANTO XXXI,"Had needed, if I had not seen the cords"
4867,CANTO XXXI,"That held him fast. We, straightway journeying on,"
4868,CANTO XXXI,"Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete"
4869,CANTO XXXI,"Without the head, forth issued from the cave."
4870,CANTO XXXI,
4871,CANTO XXXI,"“O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made"
4872,CANTO XXXI,"Great Scipio heir of glory, when his sword"
4873,CANTO XXXI,"Drove back the troop of Hannibal in flight,"
4874,CANTO XXXI,Who thence of old didst carry for thy spoil
4875,CANTO XXXI,An hundred lions; and if thou hadst fought
4876,CANTO XXXI,"In the high conflict on thy brethren’s side,"
4877,CANTO XXXI,"Seems as men yet believ’d, that through thine arm"
4878,CANTO XXXI,"The sons of earth had conquer’d, now vouchsafe"
4879,CANTO XXXI,"To place us down beneath, where numbing cold"
4880,CANTO XXXI,Locks up Cocytus. Force not that we crave
4881,CANTO XXXI,Or Tityus’ help or Typhon’s. Here is one
4882,CANTO XXXI,Can give what in this realm ye covet. Stoop
4883,CANTO XXXI,"Therefore, nor scornfully distort thy lip."
4884,CANTO XXXI,He in the upper world can yet bestow
4885,CANTO XXXI,"Renown on thee, for he doth live, and looks"
4886,CANTO XXXI,"For life yet longer, if before the time"
4887,CANTO XXXI,Grace call him not unto herself.” Thus spake
4888,CANTO XXXI,"The teacher. He in haste forth stretch’d his hands,"
4889,CANTO XXXI,And caught my guide. Alcides whilom felt
4890,CANTO XXXI,That grapple straighten’d score. Soon as my guide
4891,CANTO XXXI,"Had felt it, he bespake me thus: “This way"
4892,CANTO XXXI,"That I may clasp thee;” then so caught me up,"
4893,CANTO XXXI,That we were both one burden. As appears
4894,CANTO XXXI,"The tower of Carisenda, from beneath"
4895,CANTO XXXI,"Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud"
4896,CANTO XXXI,"So sail across, that opposite it hangs,"
4897,CANTO XXXI,"Such then Antaeus seem’d, as at mine ease"
4898,CANTO XXXI,I mark’d him stooping. I were fain at times
4899,CANTO XXXI,"T’ have pass’d another way. Yet in th’ abyss,"
4900,CANTO XXXI,"That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,"
4901,CANTO XXXI,"I,ightly he plac’d us; nor there leaning stay’d,"
4902,CANTO XXXI,But rose as in a bark the stately mast.
4903,CANTO XXXI,
4904,CANTO XXXI,
4905,CANTO XXXI,
4906,CANTO XXXI,
4907,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
4908,CANTO XXXII,
4909,CANTO XXXII,
4910,CANTO XXXII,"Could I command rough rhimes and hoarse, to suit"
4911,CANTO XXXII,"That hole of sorrow, o’er which ev’ry rock"
4912,CANTO XXXII,"His firm abutment rears, then might the vein"
4913,CANTO XXXII,Of fancy rise full springing: but not mine
4914,CANTO XXXII,"Such measures, and with falt’ring awe I touch"
4915,CANTO XXXII,The mighty theme; for to describe the depth
4916,CANTO XXXII,"Of all the universe, is no emprize"
4917,CANTO XXXII,"To jest with, and demands a tongue not us’d"
4918,CANTO XXXII,To infant babbling. But let them assist
4919,CANTO XXXII,"My song, the tuneful maidens, by whose aid"
4920,CANTO XXXII,"Amphion wall’d in Thebes, so with the truth"
4921,CANTO XXXII,"My speech shall best accord. Oh ill-starr’d folk,"
4922,CANTO XXXII,Beyond all others wretched! who abide
4923,CANTO XXXII,"In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words"
4924,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of, better had ye here on earth"
4925,CANTO XXXII,Been flocks or mountain goats. As down we stood
4926,CANTO XXXII,"In the dark pit beneath the giants’ feet,"
4927,CANTO XXXII,"But lower far than they, and I did gaze"
4928,CANTO XXXII,"Still on the lofty battlement, a voice"
4929,CANTO XXXII,Bespoke me thus: “Look how thou walkest. Take
4930,CANTO XXXII,"Good heed, thy soles do tread not on the heads"
4931,CANTO XXXII,"Of thy poor brethren.” Thereupon I turn’d,"
4932,CANTO XXXII,And saw before and underneath my feet
4933,CANTO XXXII,"A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem’d"
4934,CANTO XXXII,To glass than water. Not so thick a veil
4935,CANTO XXXII,In winter e’er hath Austrian Danube spread
4936,CANTO XXXII,"O’er his still course, nor Tanais far remote"
4937,CANTO XXXII,Under the chilling sky. Roll’d o’er that mass
4938,CANTO XXXII,"Had Tabernich or Pietrapana fall’n,"
4939,CANTO XXXII,Not e’en its rim had creak’d. As peeps the frog
4940,CANTO XXXII,"Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams"
4941,CANTO XXXII,"The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,"
4942,CANTO XXXII,"So, to where modest shame appears, thus low"
4943,CANTO XXXII,"Blue pinch’d and shrin’d in ice the spirits stood,"
4944,CANTO XXXII,Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.
4945,CANTO XXXII,"His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,"
4946,CANTO XXXII,Their eyes express’d the dolour of their heart.
4947,CANTO XXXII,
4948,CANTO XXXII,"A space I look’d around, then at my feet"
4949,CANTO XXXII,"Saw two so strictly join’d, that of their head"
4950,CANTO XXXII,"The very hairs were mingled. “Tell me ye,"
4951,CANTO XXXII,"Whose bosoms thus together press,” said I,"
4952,CANTO XXXII,"“Who are ye?” At that sound their necks they bent,"
4953,CANTO XXXII,"And when their looks were lifted up to me,"
4954,CANTO XXXII,"Straightway their eyes, before all moist within,"
4955,CANTO XXXII,"Distill’d upon their lips, and the frost bound"
4956,CANTO XXXII,The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.
4957,CANTO XXXII,Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos’d up
4958,CANTO XXXII,So stoutly. Whence like two enraged goats
4959,CANTO XXXII,They clash’d together; them such fury seiz’d.
4960,CANTO XXXII,
4961,CANTO XXXII,"And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,"
4962,CANTO XXXII,"Exclaim’d, still looking downward: “Why on us"
4963,CANTO XXXII,Dost speculate so long? If thou wouldst know
4964,CANTO XXXII,"Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave"
4965,CANTO XXXII,"Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own"
4966,CANTO XXXII,"Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves."
4967,CANTO XXXII,They from one body issued; and throughout
4968,CANTO XXXII,"Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade"
4969,CANTO XXXII,"More worthy in congealment to be fix’d,"
4970,CANTO XXXII,"Not him, whose breast and shadow Arthur’s land"
4971,CANTO XXXII,"At that one blow dissever’d, not Focaccia,"
4972,CANTO XXXII,"No not this spirit, whose o’erjutting head"
4973,CANTO XXXII,Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name
4974,CANTO XXXII,"Of Mascheroni: Tuscan if thou be,"
4975,CANTO XXXII,Well knowest who he was: and to cut short
4976,CANTO XXXII,"All further question, in my form behold"
4977,CANTO XXXII,What once was Camiccione. I await
4978,CANTO XXXII,"Carlino here my kinsman, whose deep guilt"
4979,CANTO XXXII,Shall wash out mine.” A thousand visages
4980,CANTO XXXII,"Then mark’d I, which the keen and eager cold"
4981,CANTO XXXII,Had shap’d into a doggish grin; whence creeps
4982,CANTO XXXII,"A shiv’ring horror o’er me, at the thought"
4983,CANTO XXXII,Of those frore shallows. While we journey’d on
4984,CANTO XXXII,"Toward the middle, at whose point unites"
4985,CANTO XXXII,"All heavy substance, and I trembling went"
4986,CANTO XXXII,"Through that eternal chillness, I know not"
4987,CANTO XXXII,"If will it were or destiny, or chance,"
4988,CANTO XXXII,"But, passing ’midst the heads, my foot did strike"
4989,CANTO XXXII,With violent blow against the face of one.
4990,CANTO XXXII,
4991,CANTO XXXII,"“Wherefore dost bruise me?” weeping, he exclaim’d,"
4992,CANTO XXXII,“Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge
4993,CANTO XXXII,"For Montaperto, wherefore troublest me?”"
4994,CANTO XXXII,
4995,CANTO XXXII,"I thus: “Instructor, now await me here,"
4996,CANTO XXXII,That I through him may rid me of my doubt.
4997,CANTO XXXII,"Thenceforth what haste thou wilt.” The teacher paus’d,"
4998,CANTO XXXII,"And to that shade I spake, who bitterly"
4999,CANTO XXXII,"Still curs’d me in his wrath. “What art thou, speak,"
5000,CANTO XXXII,That railest thus on others?” He replied:
5001,CANTO XXXII,"“Now who art thou, that smiting others’ cheeks"
5002,CANTO XXXII,"Through Antenora roamest, with such force"
5003,CANTO XXXII,"As were past suff’rance, wert thou living still?”"
5004,CANTO XXXII,
5005,CANTO XXXII,"“And I am living, to thy joy perchance,”"
5006,CANTO XXXII,"Was my reply, “if fame be dear to thee,"
5007,CANTO XXXII,That with the rest I may thy name enrol.”
5008,CANTO XXXII,
5009,CANTO XXXII,"“The contrary of what I covet most,”"
5010,CANTO XXXII,"Said he, “thou tender’st: hence; nor vex me more."
5011,CANTO XXXII,Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.”
5012,CANTO XXXII,
5013,CANTO XXXII,"Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:"
5014,CANTO XXXII,"“Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.”"
5015,CANTO XXXII,
5016,CANTO XXXII,"“Rend all away,” he answer’d, “yet for that"
5017,CANTO XXXII,"I will not tell nor show thee who I am,"
5018,CANTO XXXII,Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times.”
5019,CANTO XXXII,
5020,CANTO XXXII,"Now I had grasp’d his tresses, and stript off"
5021,CANTO XXXII,"More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes"
5022,CANTO XXXII,"Drawn in and downward, when another cried,"
5023,CANTO XXXII,"“What ails thee, Bocca? Sound not loud enough"
5024,CANTO XXXII,"Thy chatt’ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?"
5025,CANTO XXXII,"What devil wrings thee?”—” Now,” said I, “be dumb,"
5026,CANTO XXXII,Accursed traitor! to thy shame of thee
5027,CANTO XXXII,"True tidings will I bear.”—” Off,” he replied,"
5028,CANTO XXXII,“Tell what thou list; but as thou escape from hence
5029,CANTO XXXII,"To speak of him whose tongue hath been so glib,"
5030,CANTO XXXII,Forget not: here he wails the Frenchman’s gold.
5031,CANTO XXXII,"‘Him of Duera,’ thou canst say, ‘I mark’d,"
5032,CANTO XXXII,Where the starv’d sinners pine.’ If thou be ask’d
5033,CANTO XXXII,"What other shade was with them, at thy side"
5034,CANTO XXXII,"Is Beccaria, whose red gorge distain’d"
5035,CANTO XXXII,"The biting axe of Florence. Farther on,"
5036,CANTO XXXII,"If I misdeem not, Soldanieri bides,"
5037,CANTO XXXII,"With Ganellon, and Tribaldello, him"
5038,CANTO XXXII,Who op’d Faenza when the people slept.”
5039,CANTO XXXII,
5040,CANTO XXXII,"We now had left him, passing on our way,"
5041,CANTO XXXII,When I beheld two spirits by the ice
5042,CANTO XXXII,"Pent in one hollow, that the head of one"
5043,CANTO XXXII,Was cowl unto the other; and as bread
5044,CANTO XXXII,"Is raven’d up through hunger, th’ uppermost"
5045,CANTO XXXII,"Did so apply his fangs to th’ other’s brain,"
5046,CANTO XXXII,Where the spine joins it. Not more furiously
5047,CANTO XXXII,"On Menalippus’ temples Tydeus gnaw’d,"
5048,CANTO XXXII,Than on that skull and on its garbage he.
5049,CANTO XXXII,
5050,CANTO XXXII,“O thou who show’st so beastly sign of hate
5051,CANTO XXXII,"’Gainst him thou prey’st on, let me hear,” said I"
5052,CANTO XXXII,"“The cause, on such condition, that if right"
5053,CANTO XXXII,"Warrant thy grievance, knowing who ye are,"
5054,CANTO XXXII,"And what the colour of his sinning was,"
5055,CANTO XXXII,"I may repay thee in the world above,"
5056,CANTO XXXII,"If that, wherewith I speak be moist so long.”"
5057,CANTO XXXII,
5058,CANTO XXXII,
5059,CANTO XXXII,
5060,CANTO XXXII,
5061,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
5062,CANTO XXXIII,
5063,CANTO XXXIII,
5064,CANTO XXXIII,"His jaws uplifting from their fell repast,"
5065,CANTO XXXIII,"That sinner wip’d them on the hairs o’ th’ head,"
5066,CANTO XXXIII,"Which he behind had mangled, then began:"
5067,CANTO XXXIII,"“Thy will obeying, I call up afresh"
5068,CANTO XXXIII,"Sorrow past cure, which but to think of wrings"
5069,CANTO XXXIII,"My heart, or ere I tell on’t. But if words,"
5070,CANTO XXXIII,"That I may utter, shall prove seed to bear"
5071,CANTO XXXIII,"Fruit of eternal infamy to him,"
5072,CANTO XXXIII,"The traitor whom I gnaw at, thou at once"
5073,CANTO XXXIII,Shalt see me speak and weep. Who thou mayst be
5074,CANTO XXXIII,"I know not, nor how here below art come:"
5075,CANTO XXXIII,"But Florentine thou seemest of a truth,"
5076,CANTO XXXIII,When I do hear thee. Know I was on earth
5077,CANTO XXXIII,"Count Ugolino, and th’ Archbishop he"
5078,CANTO XXXIII,"Ruggieri. Why I neighbour him so close,"
5079,CANTO XXXIII,Now list. That through effect of his ill thoughts
5080,CANTO XXXIII,"In him my trust reposing, I was ta’en"
5081,CANTO XXXIII,"And after murder’d, need is not I tell."
5082,CANTO XXXIII,"What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,"
5083,CANTO XXXIII,"How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,"
5084,CANTO XXXIII,And know if he have wrong’d me. A small grate
5085,CANTO XXXIII,"Within that mew, which for my sake the name"
5086,CANTO XXXIII,"Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,"
5087,CANTO XXXIII,Already through its opening sev’ral moons
5088,CANTO XXXIII,"Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,"
5089,CANTO XXXIII,That from the future tore the curtain off.
5090,CANTO XXXIII,"This one, methought, as master of the sport,"
5091,CANTO XXXIII,Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps
5092,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight"
5093,CANTO XXXIII,Of Lucca to the Pisan. With lean brachs
5094,CANTO XXXIII,"Inquisitive and keen, before him rang’d"
5095,CANTO XXXIII,Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.
5096,CANTO XXXIII,After short course the father and the sons
5097,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem’d tir’d and lagging, and methought I saw"
5098,CANTO XXXIII,The sharp tusks gore their sides. When I awoke
5099,CANTO XXXIII,"Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard"
5100,CANTO XXXIII,My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask
5101,CANTO XXXIII,"For bread. Right cruel art thou, if no pang"
5102,CANTO XXXIII,Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;
5103,CANTO XXXIII,"And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?"
5104,CANTO XXXIII,Now had they waken’d; and the hour drew near
5105,CANTO XXXIII,When they were wont to bring us food; the mind
5106,CANTO XXXIII,"Of each misgave him through his dream, and I"
5107,CANTO XXXIII,"Heard, at its outlet underneath lock’d up"
5108,CANTO XXXIII,The’ horrible tower: whence uttering not a word
5109,CANTO XXXIII,I look’d upon the visage of my sons.
5110,CANTO XXXIII,I wept not: so all stone I felt within.
5111,CANTO XXXIII,"They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:"
5112,CANTO XXXIII,“Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?” Yet
5113,CANTO XXXIII,"I shed no tear, nor answer’d all that day"
5114,CANTO XXXIII,"Nor the next night, until another sun"
5115,CANTO XXXIII,Came out upon the world. When a faint beam
5116,CANTO XXXIII,"Had to our doleful prison made its way,"
5117,CANTO XXXIII,And in four countenances I descry’d
5118,CANTO XXXIII,"The image of my own, on either hand"
5119,CANTO XXXIII,"Through agony I bit, and they who thought"
5120,CANTO XXXIII,"I did it through desire of feeding, rose"
5121,CANTO XXXIII,"O’ th’ sudden, and cried, ‘Father, we should grieve"
5122,CANTO XXXIII,"Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav’st"
5123,CANTO XXXIII,"These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,"
5124,CANTO XXXIII,And do thou strip them off from us again.’
5125,CANTO XXXIII,"Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down"
5126,CANTO XXXIII,My spirit in stillness. That day and the next
5127,CANTO XXXIII,"We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth!"
5128,CANTO XXXIII,Why open’dst not upon us? When we came
5129,CANTO XXXIII,"To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet"
5130,CANTO XXXIII,"Outstretch’d did fling him, crying, ‘Hast no help"
5131,CANTO XXXIII,"For me, my father!’ “There he died, and e’en"
5132,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three"
5133,CANTO XXXIII,Fall one by one ’twixt the fifth day and sixth:
5134,CANTO XXXIII,Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope
5135,CANTO XXXIII,"Over them all, and for three days aloud"
5136,CANTO XXXIII,Call’d on them who were dead. Then fasting got
5137,CANTO XXXIII,"The mastery of grief.” Thus having spoke,"
5138,CANTO XXXIII,Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth
5139,CANTO XXXIII,"He fasten’d, like a mastiff’s ’gainst the bone"
5140,CANTO XXXIII,Firm and unyielding. Oh thou Pisa! shame
5141,CANTO XXXIII,"Of all the people, who their dwelling make"
5142,CANTO XXXIII,"In that fair region, where th’ Italian voice"
5143,CANTO XXXIII,"Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack"
5144,CANTO XXXIII,"To punish, from their deep foundations rise"
5145,CANTO XXXIII,"Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up"
5146,CANTO XXXIII,"The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee"
5147,CANTO XXXIII,May perish in the waters! What if fame
5148,CANTO XXXIII,Reported that thy castles were betray’d
5149,CANTO XXXIII,"By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou"
5150,CANTO XXXIII,"To stretch his children on the rack. For them,"
5151,CANTO XXXIII,"Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair"
5152,CANTO XXXIII,"Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,"
5153,CANTO XXXIII,"Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make"
5154,CANTO XXXIII,"Uncapable of guilt. Onward we pass’d,"
5155,CANTO XXXIII,Where others skarf’d in rugged folds of ice
5156,CANTO XXXIII,"Not on their feet were turn’d, but each revers’d"
5157,CANTO XXXIII,
5158,CANTO XXXIII,There very weeping suffers not to weep;
5159,CANTO XXXIII,For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds
5160,CANTO XXXIII,"Impediment, and rolling inward turns"
5161,CANTO XXXIII,For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears
5162,CANTO XXXIII,"Hang cluster’d, and like crystal vizors show,"
5163,CANTO XXXIII,Under the socket brimming all the cup.
5164,CANTO XXXIII,
5165,CANTO XXXIII,Now though the cold had from my face dislodg’d
5166,CANTO XXXIII,"Each feeling, as ’twere callous, yet me seem’d"
5167,CANTO XXXIII,"Some breath of wind I felt. “Whence cometh this,”"
5168,CANTO XXXIII,"Said I, “my master? Is not here below"
5169,CANTO XXXIII,"All vapour quench’d?”—“‘Thou shalt be speedily,”"
5170,CANTO XXXIII,"He answer’d, “where thine eye shall tell thee whence"
5171,CANTO XXXIII,The cause descrying of this airy shower.”
5172,CANTO XXXIII,
5173,CANTO XXXIII,Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn’d:
5174,CANTO XXXIII,“O souls so cruel! that the farthest post
5175,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath been assign’d you, from this face remove"
5176,CANTO XXXIII,"The harden’d veil, that I may vent the grief"
5177,CANTO XXXIII,"Impregnate at my heart, some little space"
5178,CANTO XXXIII,Ere it congeal again!” I thus replied:
5179,CANTO XXXIII,"“Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;"
5180,CANTO XXXIII,"And if I extricate thee not, far down"
5181,CANTO XXXIII,As to the lowest ice may I descend!”
5182,CANTO XXXIII,
5183,CANTO XXXIII,"“The friar Alberigo,” answered he,"
5184,CANTO XXXIII,"“Am I, who from the evil garden pluck’d"
5185,CANTO XXXIII,"Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date"
5186,CANTO XXXIII,"More luscious for my fig.”—“Hah!” I exclaim’d,"
5187,CANTO XXXIII,“Art thou too dead!”—“How in the world aloft
5188,CANTO XXXIII,"It fareth with my body,” answer’d he,"
5189,CANTO XXXIII,“I am right ignorant. Such privilege
5190,CANTO XXXIII,"Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul"
5191,CANTO XXXIII,"Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc’d."
5192,CANTO XXXIII,And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly
5193,CANTO XXXIII,"The glazed tear-drops that o’erlay mine eyes,"
5194,CANTO XXXIII,"Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,"
5195,CANTO XXXIII,"As I did, yields her body to a fiend"
5196,CANTO XXXIII,"Who after moves and governs it at will,"
5197,CANTO XXXIII,Till all its time be rounded; headlong she
5198,CANTO XXXIII,Falls to this cistern. And perchance above
5199,CANTO XXXIII,"Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,"
5200,CANTO XXXIII,"Who here behind me winters. Him thou know’st,"
5201,CANTO XXXIII,If thou but newly art arriv’d below.
5202,CANTO XXXIII,"The years are many that have pass’d away,"
5203,CANTO XXXIII,Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.”
5204,CANTO XXXIII,
5205,CANTO XXXIII,"“Now,” answer’d I, “methinks thou mockest me,"
5206,CANTO XXXIII,"For Branca Doria never yet hath died,"
5207,CANTO XXXIII,"But doth all natural functions of a man,"
5208,CANTO XXXIII,"Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on.”"
5209,CANTO XXXIII,
5210,CANTO XXXIII,He thus: “Not yet unto that upper foss
5211,CANTO XXXIII,"By th’ evil talons guarded, where the pitch"
5212,CANTO XXXIII,"Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach’d,"
5213,CANTO XXXIII,When this one left a demon in his stead
5214,CANTO XXXIII,"In his own body, and of one his kin,"
5215,CANTO XXXIII,Who with him treachery wrought. But now put forth
5216,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.” I op’d them not."
5217,CANTO XXXIII,Ill manners were best courtesy to him.
5218,CANTO XXXIII,
5219,CANTO XXXIII,"Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,"
5220,CANTO XXXIII,"With every foulness stain’d, why from the earth"
5221,CANTO XXXIII,Are ye not cancel’d? Such an one of yours
5222,CANTO XXXIII,"I with Romagna’s darkest spirit found,"
5223,CANTO XXXIII,As for his doings even now in soul
5224,CANTO XXXIII,"Is in Cocytus plung’d, and yet doth seem"
5225,CANTO XXXIII,In body still alive upon the earth.
5226,CANTO XXXIII,
5227,CANTO XXXIII,
5228,CANTO XXXIII,
5229,CANTO XXXIII,
5230,CANTO XXXIV,CANTO XXXIV
5231,CANTO XXXIV,
5232,CANTO XXXIV,
5233,CANTO XXXIV,“The banners of Hell’s Monarch do come forth
5234,CANTO XXXIV,"Towards us; therefore look,” so spake my guide,"
5235,CANTO XXXIV,"“If thou discern him.” As, when breathes a cloud"
5236,CANTO XXXIV,"Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night"
5237,CANTO XXXIV,"Fall on our hemisphere, seems view’d from far"
5238,CANTO XXXIV,"A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,"
5239,CANTO XXXIV,"Such was the fabric then methought I saw,"
5240,CANTO XXXIV,
5241,CANTO XXXIV,"To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew"
5242,CANTO XXXIV,Behind my guide: no covert else was there.
5243,CANTO XXXIV,
5244,CANTO XXXIV,Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain
5245,CANTO XXXIV,Record the marvel) where the souls were all
5246,CANTO XXXIV,"Whelm’d underneath, transparent, as through glass"
5247,CANTO XXXIV,"Pellucid the frail stem. Some prone were laid,"
5248,CANTO XXXIV,"Others stood upright, this upon the soles,"
5249,CANTO XXXIV,"That on his head, a third with face to feet"
5250,CANTO XXXIV,"Arch’d like a bow. When to the point we came,"
5251,CANTO XXXIV,Whereat my guide was pleas’d that I should see
5252,CANTO XXXIV,"The creature eminent in beauty once,"
5253,CANTO XXXIV,He from before me stepp’d and made me pause.
5254,CANTO XXXIV,
5255,CANTO XXXIV,"“Lo!” he exclaim’d, “lo Dis! and lo the place,"
5256,CANTO XXXIV,Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.”
5257,CANTO XXXIV,
5258,CANTO XXXIV,"How frozen and how faint I then became,"
5259,CANTO XXXIV,"Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,"
5260,CANTO XXXIV,Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.
5261,CANTO XXXIV,I was not dead nor living. Think thyself
5262,CANTO XXXIV,"If quick conception work in thee at all,"
5263,CANTO XXXIV,"How I did feel. That emperor, who sways"
5264,CANTO XXXIV,"The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th’ ice"
5265,CANTO XXXIV,Stood forth; and I in stature am more like
5266,CANTO XXXIV,"A giant, than the giants are in his arms."
5267,CANTO XXXIV,"Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits"
5268,CANTO XXXIV,With such a part. If he were beautiful
5269,CANTO XXXIV,"As he is hideous now, and yet did dare"
5270,CANTO XXXIV,"To scowl upon his Maker, well from him"
5271,CANTO XXXIV,May all our mis’ry flow. Oh what a sight!
5272,CANTO XXXIV,"How passing strange it seem’d, when I did spy"
5273,CANTO XXXIV,Upon his head three faces: one in front
5274,CANTO XXXIV,"Of hue vermilion, th’ other two with this"
5275,CANTO XXXIV,Midway each shoulder join’d and at the crest;
5276,CANTO XXXIV,The right ’twixt wan and yellow seem’d: the left
5277,CANTO XXXIV,"To look on, such as come from whence old Nile"
5278,CANTO XXXIV,Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth
5279,CANTO XXXIV,"Two mighty wings, enormous as became"
5280,CANTO XXXIV,A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw
5281,CANTO XXXIV,"Outstretch’d on the wide sea. No plumes had they,"
5282,CANTO XXXIV,"But were in texture like a bat, and these"
5283,CANTO XXXIV,"He flapp’d i’ th’ air, that from him issued still"
5284,CANTO XXXIV,"Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth"
5285,CANTO XXXIV,Was frozen. At six eyes he wept: the tears
5286,CANTO XXXIV,Adown three chins distill’d with bloody foam.
5287,CANTO XXXIV,At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ’d
5288,CANTO XXXIV,"Bruis’d as with pond’rous engine, so that three"
5289,CANTO XXXIV,Were in this guise tormented. But far more
5290,CANTO XXXIV,"Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang’d"
5291,CANTO XXXIV,"By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back"
5292,CANTO XXXIV,"Was stript of all its skin. “That upper spirit,"
5293,CANTO XXXIV,"Who hath worse punishment,” so spake my guide,"
5294,CANTO XXXIV,"“Is Judas, he that hath his head within"

5301,CANTO XXXIV,
5302,CANTO XXXIV,"I clipp’d him round the neck, for so he bade;"
5303,CANTO XXXIV,"And noting time and place, he, when the wings"
5304,CANTO XXXIV,"Enough were op’d, caught fast the shaggy sides,"
5305,CANTO XXXIV,And down from pile to pile descending stepp’d
5306,CANTO XXXIV,Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.
5307,CANTO XXXIV,
5308,CANTO XXXIV,"Soon as he reach’d the point, whereat the thigh"
5309,CANTO XXXIV,"Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,"
5310,CANTO XXXIV,My leader there with pain and struggling hard
5311,CANTO XXXIV,"Turn’d round his head, where his feet stood before,"
5312,CANTO XXXIV,"And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,"
5313,CANTO XXXIV,That into hell methought we turn’d again.
5314,CANTO XXXIV,
5315,CANTO XXXIV,"“Expect that by such stairs as these,” thus spake"
5316,CANTO XXXIV,"The teacher, panting like a man forespent,"
5317,CANTO XXXIV,“We must depart from evil so extreme.”
5318,CANTO XXXIV,"Then at a rocky opening issued forth,"
5319,CANTO XXXIV,"And plac’d me on a brink to sit, next join’d"
5320,CANTO XXXIV,"With wary step my side. I rais’d mine eyes,"
5321,CANTO XXXIV,Believing that I Lucifer should see
5322,CANTO XXXIV,"Where he was lately left, but saw him now"
5323,CANTO XXXIV,"With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort,"
5324,CANTO XXXIV,"Who see not what the point was I had pass’d,"
5325,CANTO XXXIV,Bethink them if sore toil oppress’d me then.
5326,CANTO XXXIV,
5327,CANTO XXXIV,"“Arise,” my master cried, “upon thy feet."
5328,CANTO XXXIV,"“The way is long, and much uncouth the road;"
5329,CANTO XXXIV,And now within one hour and half of noon
5330,CANTO XXXIV,The sun returns.” It was no palace-hall
5331,CANTO XXXIV,"Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,"
5332,CANTO XXXIV,But natural dungeon where ill footing was
5333,CANTO XXXIV,And scant supply of light. “Ere from th’ abyss
5334,CANTO XXXIV,"I sep’rate,” thus when risen I began,"
5335,CANTO XXXIV,“My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free
5336,CANTO XXXIV,From error’s thralldom. Where is now the ice?
5337,CANTO XXXIV,How standeth he in posture thus revers’d?
5338,CANTO XXXIV,And how from eve to morn in space so brief
5339,CANTO XXXIV,Hath the sun made his transit?” He in few
5340,CANTO XXXIV,Thus answering spake: “Thou deemest thou art still
5341,CANTO XXXIV,"On th’ other side the centre, where I grasp’d"
5342,CANTO XXXIV,"Th’ abhorred worm, that boreth through the world."
5343,CANTO XXXIV,"Thou wast on th’ other side, so long as I"
5344,CANTO XXXIV,"Descended; when I turn’d, thou didst o’erpass"
5345,CANTO XXXIV,"That point, to which from ev’ry part is dragg’d"
5346,CANTO XXXIV,All heavy substance. Thou art now arriv’d
5347,CANTO XXXIV,"Under the hemisphere opposed to that,"
5348,CANTO XXXIV,"Which the great continent doth overspread,"
5349,CANTO XXXIV,And underneath whose canopy expir’d
5350,CANTO XXXIV,"The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv’d."
5351,CANTO XXXIV,"Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,"
5352,CANTO XXXIV,Whose other aspect is Judecca. Morn
5353,CANTO XXXIV,"Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,"
5354,CANTO XXXIV,"Whose shaggy pile was scal’d, yet standeth fix’d,"
5355,CANTO XXXIV,As at the first. On this part he fell down
5356,CANTO XXXIV,"From heav’n; and th’ earth, here prominent before,"
5357,CANTO XXXIV,"Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,"
5358,CANTO XXXIV,And to our hemisphere retir’d. Perchance
5359,CANTO XXXIV,To shun him was the vacant space left here
5360,CANTO XXXIV,"By what of firm land on this side appears,"
5361,CANTO XXXIV,"That sprang aloof.” There is a place beneath,"
5362,CANTO XXXIV,"From Belzebub as distant, as extends"
5363,CANTO XXXIV,"The vaulted tomb, discover’d not by sight,"
5364,CANTO XXXIV,"But by the sound of brooklet, that descends"
5365,CANTO XXXIV,"This way along the hollow of a rock,"
5366,CANTO XXXIV,"Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,"
5367,CANTO XXXIV,The wave hath eaten. By that hidden way
5368,CANTO XXXIV,"My guide and I did enter, to return"
5369,CANTO XXXIV,To the fair world: and heedless of repose
5370,CANTO XXXIV,"We climbed, he first, I following his steps,"
5371,CANTO XXXIV,Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav’n
5372,CANTO XXXIV,"Dawn, through a circular opening in the cave:"
5373,CANTO XXXIV,Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.

6043,CANTO X,of him by contemporary writers his temper was well formed to assimilate
6044,CANTO X,"with that of our poet. “He was,” according to G. Villani, l. viii. c."
6045,CANTO X,"41. “of a philosophical and elegant mind, if he had not been too"
6046,CANTO X,delicate and fastidious.” And Dino Compagni terms him “a young and

6054,CANTO X,"compositions by Guido are, however, still extant; and his reputation"
6055,CANTO X,for skill in the art was such as to eclipse that of his predecessor and
6056,CANTO X,"namesake Guido Guinicelli, as we shall see in the Purgatory, Canto XI."

6079,[GREEK HERE],"v.83. The slaughter.] “By means of Farinata degli Uberti, the Guelfi"
6080,[GREEK HERE],"were conquered by the army of King Manfredi, near the river Arbia, with"
6081,[GREEK HERE],"so great a slaughter, that those who escaped from that defeat took"

6083,[GREEK HERE],in Lucca.” Macchiavelli. Hist. of Flor. b 2.

6091,[GREEK HERE],"maintain the ascendancy of the Ghibelline party in Tuscany, it was"
6092,[GREEK HERE],"necessary to destroy Florence, which could serve only (the people of"
6093,[GREEK HERE],that city beingvGuelfi) to enable the party attached to the church to
6094,[GREEK HERE],"recover its strength. This cruel sentence, passed upon so noble a city,"
6095,[GREEK HERE],"met with no opposition from any of its citizens or friends, except"
6096,[GREEK HERE],"Farinata degli Uberti, who openly and without reserve forbade the"

6120,CANTO XI,"identity of the person, who is here mentioned as a follower of the"
6121,CANTO XI,heretical Photinus. By some he is supposed to have been Anastasius the
6122,CANTO XI,"Second, by others, the Fourth of that name; while a third set, jealous"
6123,CANTO XI,"of the integrity of the papal faith, contend that our poet has"
6124,CANTO XI,confounded him with Anastasius 1. Emperor of the East.

6258,CANTO XIII,the office of Chancellor to the Emperor Frederick II. whose confidence
6259,CANTO XIII,"in him was such, that his influence in the empire became unbounded. The"

6262,CANTO XIII,"traitorous intercourse with the Pope, who was then at enmity with the"
6263,CANTO XIII,Emperor. In consequence of this supposed crime he was cruelly condemned
6264,CANTO XIII,"by his too credulous sovereign to lose his eyes, and, being driven to"
6265,CANTO XIII,"despair by his unmerited calamity and disgrace, he put an end to his"
6266,CANTO XIII,"life by dashing out his brains against the walls of a church, in the"

6296,CANTO XIII,"the Baptist, for which reason the vengeance of the deity thus slighted"
6297,CANTO XIII,"will never be appeased: and, if some remains of his status were not"
6298,CANTO XIII,"still visible on the bridge over the Arno, she would have been already"
6299,CANTO XIII,"leveled to the ground; and thus the citizens, who raised her again from"
6300,CANTO XIII,"the ashes to which Attila had reduced her, would have laboured in"
6301,CANTO XIII,"vain.” See Paradise, Canto XVI. 44. The relic of antiquity to which the"

6303,CANTO XIII,"away by a flood, that destroyed the bridge on which it stood, in the"

6357,CANTO XV,"v. 28. Brunetto.] “Ser Brunetto, a Florentine, the secretary or"
6358,CANTO XV,"chancellor of the city, and Dante’s preceptor, hath left us a work so"
6359,CANTO XV,"little read, that both the subject of it and the language of it have"
6360,CANTO XV,been mistaken. It is in the French spoken in the reign of St.
6361,CANTO XV,"Louis,under the title of Tresor, and contains a species of"
6362,CANTO XV,"philosophical course of lectures divided into theory and practice, or,"
6363,CANTO XV,"as he expresses it, “un enchaussement des choses divines et humaines,”"
6364,CANTO XV,"&c. Sir R. Clayton’s Translation of Tenhove’s Memoirs of the Medici,"
6365,CANTO XV,vol. i. ch. ii. p. 104. The Tresor has never been printed in the

6367,CANTO XV,"Museum, with an illuminated portrait of Brunetto in his study prefixed."
6368,CANTO XV,"Mus. Brit. MSS. 17, E. 1. Tesor. It is divided into four books, the"

6371,CANTO XV,"Rhetoric. For an interesting memoir relating to this work, see Hist. de"
6372,CANTO XV,"l’Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. vii. 296. His Tesoretto, one of the"
6373,CANTO XV,"earliest productions of Italian poetry, is a curious work, not unlike"
6374,CANTO XV,"the writings of Chaucer in style and numbers, though Bembo remarks,"
6375,CANTO XV,"that his pupil, however largely he had stolen from it, could not have"
6376,CANTO XV,"much enriched himself. As it is perhaps but little known, I will here"
6377,CANTO XV,add a slight sketch of it.
6378,CANTO XV,
6379,CANTO XV,Brunetto describes himself as returning from an embassy to the King of
6380,CANTO XV,"Spain, on which he had been sent by the Guelph party from Florence. On"
6381,CANTO XV,"the plain of Roncesvalles he meets a scholar on a bay mule, who tells"
6382,CANTO XV,him that the Guelfi are driven out of the city with great loss.
6383,CANTO XV,
6384,CANTO XV,"Struck with grief at these mournful tidings, and musing with his head"
6385,CANTO XV,"bent downwards, he loses his road, and wanders into a wood. Here"
6386,CANTO XV,"Nature, whose figure is described with sublimity, appears, and"
6387,CANTO XV,discloses to him the secrets of her operations. After this he wanders
6388,CANTO XV,"into a desert; but at length proceeds on his way, under the protection"
6389,CANTO XV,"of a banner, with which Nature had furnished him, till on the third day"
6390,CANTO XV,"he finds himself in a large pleasant champaign, where are assembled"
6391,CANTO XV,"many emperors, kings, and sages. It is the habitation of Virtue and her"
6392,CANTO XV,"daughters, the four Cardinal Virtues. Here Brunetto sees also Courtesy,"
6393,CANTO XV,"Bounty, Loyalty, and Prowess, and hears the instructions they give to a"
6394,CANTO XV,"knight, which occupy about a fourth part of the poem. Leaving this"
6395,CANTO XV,"territory, he passes over valleys, mountains, woods, forests, and"
6396,CANTO XV,"bridges, till he arrives in a beautiful valley covered with flowers on"
6397,CANTO XV,"all sides, and the richest in the world; but which was continually"
6398,CANTO XV,"shifting its appearance from a round figure to a square, from obscurity"
6399,CANTO XV,"to light, and from populousness to solitude. This is the region of"
6400,CANTO XV,"Pleasure, or Cupid, who is accompanied by four ladies, Love, Hope,"
6401,CANTO XV,"Fear, and Desire. In one part of it he meets with Ovid, and is"
6402,CANTO XV,"instructed by him how to conquer the passion of love, and to escape"
6403,CANTO XV,"from that place. After his escape he makes his confession to a friar,"
6404,CANTO XV,"and then returns to the forest of visions: and ascending a mountain, he"

6409,CANTO XV,"It has been observed, that Dante derived the idea of opening his poem"
6410,CANTO XV,"by describing himself as lost in a wood, from the Tesoretto of his"
6411,CANTO XV,"master. I know not whether it has been remarked, that the crime of"
6412,CANTO XV,usury is branded by both these poets as offensive to God and Nature: or
6413,CANTO XV,"that the sin for which Brunetto is condemned by his pupil, is mentioned"
6414,CANTO XV,in the Tesoretto with great horror. Dante’s twenty-fifth sonnet is a
6415,CANTO XV,"jocose one, addressed to Brunetto. He died in 1295."

6421,CANTO XV,Canto X.

6423,CANTO XV,"v. 110. Priscian.] There is no reason to believe, as the commentators"
6424,CANTO XV,observe that the grammarian of this name was stained with the vice
6425,CANTO XV,imputed to him; and we must therefore suppose that Dante puts the
6426,CANTO XV,"individual for the species, and implies the frequency of the crime"
6427,CANTO XV,among those who abused the opportunities which the education of youth
6428,CANTO XV,"afforded them, to so abominable a purpose."
6429,CANTO XV,

6460,CANTO XVI,"The Emperor Otho IV. being at a festival in Florence, where Gualdrada"
6461,CANTO XVI,"was present, was struck with her beauty; and inquiring who she was, was"
6462,CANTO XVI,"answered by Bellincione, that she was the daughter of one who, if it"
6463,CANTO XVI,"was his Majesty’s pleasure, would make her admit the honour of his"
6464,CANTO XVI,"salute. On overhearing this, she arose from her seat, and blushing, in"
6465,CANTO XVI,"an animated tone of voice, desired her father that he would not be so"
6466,CANTO XVI,"liberal in his offers, for that no man should ever be allowed that"
6467,CANTO XVI,"freedom, except him who should be her lawful husband. The Emperor was"
6468,CANTO XVI,not less delighted by her resolute modesty than he had before been by
6469,CANTO XVI,"the loveliness of her person, and calling to him Guido, one of his"
6470,CANTO XVI,"barons, gave her to him in marriage, at the same time raising him"
6471,CANTO XVI,
6472,CANTO XVI,"to the rank of a count, and bestowing on her the whole of Casentino,"
6473,CANTO XVI,"and a part of the territory of Romagna, as her portion. Two sons were"

6475,CANTO XVI,"was father of Guidoguerra, a man of great military skill and prowess"
6476,CANTO XVI,"who, at the head of four hundred Florentines of the Guelph party, was"
6477,CANTO XVI,signally instrumental to the victory obtained at Benevento by Charles
6478,CANTO XVI,"of Anjou, over Manfredi, King of Naples, in 1265. One of the"

6487,CANTO XVI,"the Siennese, and the rejection of his counsel occasioned the memorable"

6762,CANTO XXI,"place in 1290. See G. Villani, Hist. l. vii. c. 136."
6763,CANTO XXI,
6764,CANTO XXI,v. 109. Yesterday.] This passage fixes the era of Dante’s descent at
6765,CANTO XXI,"Good Friday, in the year 1300 (34 years from our blessed Lord’s"
6766,CANTO XXI,"incarnation being added to 1266), and at the thirty-fifth year of our"
6767,CANTO XXI,poet’s age. See Canto I. v. 1.
6768,CANTO XXI,
6769,CANTO XXI,"The awful event alluded to, the Evangelists inform us, happened “at the"
6770,CANTO XXI,"ninth hour,” that is, our sixth, when “the rocks were rent,” and the"
6771,CANTO XXI,"convulsion, according to Dante, was felt even in the depths in Hell."

6781,CANTO XXII,have been Ciampolo.
6782,CANTO XXII,
6783,CANTO XXII,"v. 51. The good king Thibault.] “Thibault I. king of Navarre, died on"
6784,CANTO XXII,"the 8th of June, 1233, as much to be commended for the desire he showed"
6785,CANTO XXII,"of aiding the war in the Holy Land, as reprehensible and faulty for his"
6786,CANTO XXII,"design of oppressing the rights and privileges of the church, on which"
6787,CANTO XXII,account it is said that the whole kingdom was under an interdict for
6788,CANTO XXII,"the space of three entire years. Thibault undoubtedly merits praise, as"
6789,CANTO XXII,"for his other endowments, so especially for his cultivation of the"
6790,CANTO XXII,"liberal arts, his exercise and knowledge of music and poetry in which"
6791,CANTO XXII,"he much excelled, that he was accustomed to compose verses and sing"
6792,CANTO XXII,"them to the viol, and to exhibit his poetical compositions publicly in"
6793,CANTO XXII,"his palace, that they might be criticized by all.” Mariana, History of"

6807,CANTO XXII,
6808,CANTO XXII,v. 80. The friar Gomita.] He was entrusted by Nino de’ Visconti with
6809,CANTO XXII,"the government of Gallura, one of the four jurisdictions into which"
6810,CANTO XXII,"Sardinia was divided. Having his master’s enemies in his power, he took"
6811,CANTO XXII,"a bribe from them, and allowed them to escape. Mention of Nino will"

6821,CANTO XXIII,"mouse across a ditch, with the intention of drowning him when both were"
6822,CANTO XXIII,carried off by a kite. It is not among those Greek Fables which go
6823,CANTO XXIII,under the name of Aesop.
6824,CANTO XXIII,
6825,CANTO XXIII,v. 63. Monks in Cologne.] They wore their cowls unusually large. v. 66.
6826,CANTO XXIII,Frederick’s.] The Emperor Frederick II. is said to have punished those
6827,CANTO XXIII,"who were guilty of high treason, by wrapping them up in lead, and"
6828,CANTO XXIII,casting them into a furnace.
6829,CANTO XXIII,
6830,CANTO XXIII,v. 101. Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue.] It is observed by
6831,CANTO XXIII,"Venturi, that the word “rance” does not here signify “rancid or"
6832,CANTO XXIII,"disgustful,” as it is explained by the old commentators, but"
6833,CANTO XXIII,"“orange-coloured,” in which sense it occurs in the Purgatory, Canto II."
6834,CANTO XXIII,9.
6835,CANTO XXIII,
6836,CANTO XXIII,v. 104. Joyous friars.] “Those who ruled the city of Florence on the
6837,CANTO XXIII,"part of the Ghibillines, perceiving this discontent and murmuring,"
6838,CANTO XXIII,"which they were fearful might produce a rebellion against themselves,"
6839,CANTO XXIII,"in order to satisfy the people, made choice of two knights, Frati"
6840,CANTO XXIII,"Godenti (joyous friars) of Bologna, on whom they conferred the chief"
6841,CANTO XXIII,"power in Florence. One named M. Catalano de’ Malavolti, the other M."
6842,CANTO XXIII,"Loderingo di Liandolo; one an adherent of the Guelph, the other of the"
6843,CANTO XXIII,"Ghibelline party. It is to be remarked, that the Joyous Friars were"
6844,CANTO XXIII,"called Knights of St. Mary, and became knights on taking that habit:"
6845,CANTO XXIII,"their robes were white, the mantle sable, and the arms a white field"
6846,CANTO XXIII,and red cross with two stars. Their office was to defend widows and
6847,CANTO XXIII,orphans; they were to act as mediators; they had internal regulations
6848,CANTO XXIII,like other religious bodies. The above-mentioned M. Loderingo was the
6849,CANTO XXIII,founder of that order. But it was not long before they too well
6850,CANTO XXIII,"deserved the appellation given them, and were found to be more bent on"
6851,CANTO XXIII,enjoying themselves than on any other subject. These two friars were
6852,CANTO XXIII,"called in by the Florentines, and had a residence assigned them in the"
6853,CANTO XXIII,palace belonging to the people over against the Abbey. Such was the
6854,CANTO XXIII,dependence placed on the character of their order that it was expected
6855,CANTO XXIII,"they would be impartial, and would save the commonwealth any"
6856,CANTO XXIII,"unnecessary expense; instead of which, though inclined to opposite"
6857,CANTO XXIII,"parties, they secretly and hypocritically concurred in promoting their"
6858,CANTO XXIII,"own advantage rather than the public good.” G. Villani, b. vii. c.13."
6859,CANTO XXIII,This happened in 1266.
6860,CANTO XXIII,
6861,CANTO XXIII,v. 110. Gardingo’s vicinage.] The name of that part of the city which
6862,CANTO XXIII,"was inhabited by the powerful Ghibelline family of Uberti, and"
6863,CANTO XXIII,destroyed under the partial and iniquitous administration of Catalano
6864,CANTO XXIII,and Loderingo.

7161,CANTO XXVII.,the family of Colonna prompted him to destroy their houses near the

7164,CANTO XXVII.,"purpose, offering him at the same time absolution for his past sins, as"
7165,CANTO XXVII.,well as for that which he was then tempting him to commit. Guido’s
7166,CANTO XXVII.,"advice was, that kind words and fair promises nonld put his enemies"
7167,CANTO XXVII.,into his power; and they accordingly soon aftermards fell into the

7173,CANTO XXVII.,"Iloly Land. The regret expressed by the Florentine annalist G. Villani,"
7174,CANTO XXVII.,"for the loss of this valuable fortress, is well worthy of observation,"
7175,CANTO XXVII.,l. vii. c. 144.
7176,CANTO XXVII.,
7177,CANTO XXVII.,v. 89. As in Soracte Constantine besought.] So in Dante’s treatise De

7191,CANTO XXVIII.,"poured out in the senate house, which made so large a heap, that, as"
7192,CANTO XXVIII.,"some relate, they filled three modii and a half. A more probable"

7212,CANTO XXVIII.,"regular order, contrived to raise in Novarra, in Lombardy, a large"
7213,CANTO XXVIII.,"company of the meaner sort of people, declaring himself to be a true"
7214,CANTO XXVIII.,"apostle of Christ, and promulgating a community of property and of"
7215,CANTO XXVIII.,"wives, with many other such heretical doctrines. He blamed the pope,"
7216,CANTO XXVIII.,"cardinals, and other prelates of the holy church, for not observing"
7217,CANTO XXVIII.,"their duty, nor leading the angelic life, and affirmed that he ought to"
7218,CANTO XXVIII.,"be pope. He was followed by more than three thousand men and women, who"
7219,CANTO XXVIII.,"lived promiscuously on the mountains together, like beasts, and, when"
7220,CANTO XXVIII.,"they wanted provisions, supplied themselves by depredation and rapine."
7221,CANTO XXVIII.,"This lasted for two years till, many being struck with compunction at"
7222,CANTO XXVIII.,"the dissolute life they led, his sect was much diminished; and through"
7223,CANTO XXVIII.,"failure of food, and the severity of the snows, he was taken by the"
7224,CANTO XXVIII.,"people of Novarra, and burnt, with Margarita his companion and many"
7225,CANTO XXVIII.,"other men and women whom his errors had seduced.” G. Villanni, l. viii."
7226,CANTO XXVIII.,c. 84.
7227,CANTO XXVIII.,
7228,CANTO XXVIII.,"Landino observes, that he was possessed of singular eloquence, and that"
7229,CANTO XXVIII.,both he and Margarita endored their fate with a firmness worthy of a
7230,CANTO XXVIII.,"better cause. For a further account of him, see Muratori Rer. Ital."
7231,CANTO XXVIII.,Script. t. ix. p. 427.
7232,CANTO XXVIII.,
7233,CANTO XXVIII.,v. 69. Medicina.] A place in the territory of Bologna. Piero fomented

7238,CANTO XXVIII.,
7239,CANTO XXVIII.,"v. 72. The twain.] Guido dal Cassero and Angiolello da Cagnano, two of"
7240,CANTO XXVIII.,"the worthiest and most distinguished citizens of Fano, were invited by"
7241,CANTO XXVIII.,Malatestino da Rimini to an entertainment on pretence that he had some
7242,CANTO XXVIII.,"important business to transact with them: and, according to"
7243,CANTO XXVIII.,"instructions given by him, they mere drowned in their passage near"
7244,CANTO XXVIII.,"Catolica, between Rimini and Fano."
7245,CANTO XXVIII.,
7246,CANTO XXVIII.,"v. 85. Focara’s wind.] Focara is a mountain, from which a wind blows"
7247,CANTO XXVIII.,that is peculiarly dangerous to the navigators of that coast.
7248,CANTO XXVIII.,
7249,CANTO XXVIII.,"v. 94. The doubt in Caesar’s mind.] Curio, whose speech (according to"
7250,CANTO XXVIII.,Lucan) determined Julius Caesar to proceed when he had arrived at
7251,CANTO XXVIII.,"Rimini (the ancient Ariminum), and doubted whether he should prosecute"
7252,CANTO XXVIII.,"the civil war. Tolle moras: semper nocuit differre paratis Pharsal, l."
7253,CANTO XXVIII.,i. 281.
7254,CANTO XXVIII.,
7255,CANTO XXVIII.,v. 102. Mosca.] Buondelmonte was engaged to marry a lady of the Amidei
7256,CANTO XXVIII.,"family, but broke his promise and united himself to one of the Donati."
7257,CANTO XXVIII.,"This was so much resented by the former, that a meeting of themselves"
7258,CANTO XXVIII.,"and their kinsmen was held, to consider of the best means of revenging"
7259,CANTO XXVIII.,the insult. Mosca degli Uberti persuaded them to resolve on the
7260,CANTO XXVIII.,"assassination of Buondelmonte, exclaiming to them “the thing once done,"
7261,CANTO XXVIII.,there is an end.” The counsel and its effects were the source of many
7262,CANTO XXVIII.,"terrible calamities to the state of Florence. “This murder,” says G."
7263,CANTO XXVIII.,"Villani, l. v. c. 38, “was the cause and beginning of the accursed"
7264,CANTO XXVIII.,Guelph and Ghibelline parties in Florence.” It happened in 1215. See
7265,CANTO XXVIII.,"the Paradise, Canto XVI. 139."
7266,CANTO XXVIII.,
7267,CANTO XXVIII.,v. 111. The boon companion.] What stronger breastplate than a heart
7268,CANTO XXVIII.,"untainted? Shakespeare, 2 Hen. VI. a. iii. s. 2."

7271,CANTO XXVIII.,"Perigueux in Guienne, who incited John to rebel against his father,"
7272,CANTO XXVIII.,Henry II. of England. Bertrand holds a distinguished place among the
7273,CANTO XXVIII.,"Provencal poets. He is quoted in Dante, “De Vulg. Eloq.” l. ii. c. 2."
7274,CANTO XXVIII.,"For the translation of some extracts from his poems, see Millot, Hist."
7275,CANTO XXVIII.,Litteraire des Troubadors t. i. p. 210; but the historical parts of
7276,CANTO XXVIII.,"that work are, I believe, not to be relied on."
7277,CANTO XXVIII.,
7278,CANTO XXIX.,CANTO XXIX.
7279,CANTO XXIX.,
7280,CANTO XXIX.,
7281,CANTO XXIX.,"v. 26. Geri of Bello.] A kinsman of the Poet’s, who was murdered by one"
7282,CANTO XXIX.,"of the Sacchetti family. His being placed here, may be considered as a"
7283,CANTO XXIX.,proof that Dante was more impartial in the allotment of his punishments
7284,CANTO XXIX.,than has generally been supposed.
7285,CANTO XXIX.,
7286,CANTO XXIX.,v. 44. As were the torment.] It is very probable that these
7287,CANTO XXIX.,lines gave Milton the idea of his celebrated description:
7288,CANTO XXIX.,
7289,CANTO XXIX.,Immediately a place
7290,CANTO XXIX.,
7291,CANTO XXIX.,"Before their eyes appear’d, sad, noisome, dark,"

7299,CANTO XXIX.,"v. 45. Valdichiana.] The valley through which passes the river Chiana,"
7300,CANTO XXIX.,"bounded by Arezzo, Cortona, Montepulciano, and Chiusi. In the heat of"
7301,CANTO XXIX.,autumn it was formerly rendered unwholesome by the stagnation of the
7302,CANTO XXIX.,"water, but has since been drained by the Emperor Leopold II. The Chiana"
7303,CANTO XXIX.,"is mentioned as a remarkably sluggish stream, in the Paradise, Canto"
7304,XIII. 21.,XIII. 21.
7305,XIII. 21.,

7312,XIII. 21.,"Albero, son of the Bishop of Sienna, that he would teach him the art of"
7313,XIII. 21.,"flying; and because be did not keep his promise, Albero prevailed on"

7326,XIII. 141.,"a company of prodigal and luxurious young men in Sienna, called the"
7327,XIII. 141.,“brigata godereccia.” Niccolo was the inventor of a new manner of using
7328,XIII. 141.,"cloves in cookery, not very well understood by the commentators, and"
7329,XIII. 141.,which was termed the “costuma ricca.”

7342,CANTO XXX.,
7343,CANTO XXX.,"v. 33. Schicchi.] Gianni Schicci, who was of the family of Cavalcanti,"
7344,CANTO XXX.,possessed such a faculty of moulding his features to the resemblance of
7345,CANTO XXX.,"others, that he was employed by Simon Donati to personate Buoso Donati,"
7346,CANTO XXX.,"then recently deceased, and to make a will, leaving Simon his heir; for"
7347,CANTO XXX.,"which service he was renumerated with a mare of extraordinary value,"

7365,CANTO XXX.,prosperity in the annals of the republic; before which time their most

7376,CANTO XXXI.,"middle of the twelfth century: and Millot observes, that it was a"
7377,CANTO XXXI.,singular instance of erudition in a Troubadour. But it is not
7378,CANTO XXXI.,"impossible, as Warton remarks, (Hist. of Engl. Poetry, vol. ii. sec. x."
7379,CANTO XXXI.,p 215.) but that he might have been indebted for it to some of the
7380,CANTO XXXI.,early romances.

7462,CANTO XXXII.,the Bianca and Ghibelline party had defended it against a siege for
7463,CANTO XXXII.,"twenty-nine days, in the summer of 1302. See G. Villani, l. viii. c. 52"

7474,CANTO XXXII.,"Parma, with the defence of which he had been entrusted by the"
7475,CANTO XXXII.,"Ghibellines, open to the army of Charles of Anjou, A.D. 1265, at which"
7476,CANTO XXXII.,"the people of Cremona were so enraged, that they extirpated the whole"

7480,CANTO XXXII.,"Florence, where his intrigues in favour of the Ghibellines being"
7481,CANTO XXXII.,"discovered, he was beheaded. I do not find the occurrence in Vallini,"
7482,CANTO XXXII.,nor do the commentators say to what pope he was legate. By Landino he
7483,CANTO XXXII.,"is reported to have been from Parma, by Vellutello from Pavia."

7487,CANTO XXXII.,"into power, not aware that the result would be mischief to the"
7488,CANTO XXXII.,"Ghibelline party, and his own ruin; an event which seems ever to have"
7489,CANTO XXXII.,"befallen him, who has headed the populace in Florence.” A.D. 1266."

7505,CANTO XXXIII.,"v. 14. Count Ugolino.] “In the year 1288, in the month of July, Pisa"
7506,CANTO XXXIII.,"was much divided by competitors for the sovereignty; one party,"
7507,CANTO XXXIII.,"composed of certain of the Guelphi, being headed by the Judge Nino di"
7508,CANTO XXXIII.,"Gallura de’Visconti; another, consisting of others of the same faction,"
7509,CANTO XXXIII.,by the Count Ugolino de’ Gherardeschi; and the third by the Archbishop
7510,CANTO XXXIII.,"Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, with the Lanfranchi, Sismondi, Gualandi, and"
7511,CANTO XXXIII.,"other Ghibelline houses. The Count Ugolino,to effect his purpose,"
7512,CANTO XXXIII.,"united with the Archbishop and his party, and having betrayed Nino, his"
7513,CANTO XXXIII.,"sister’s son, they contrived that he and his followers should either be"
7514,CANTO XXXIII.,"driven out of Pisa, or their persons seized. Nino hearing this, and not"
7515,CANTO XXXIII.,"seeing any means of defending himself, retired to Calci, his castle,"
7516,CANTO XXXIII.,"and formed an alliance with the Florentines and people of Lucca,"
7517,CANTO XXXIII.,"against the Pisans. The Count, before Nino was gone, in order to cover"
7518,CANTO XXXIII.,"his treachery, when everything was settled for his expulsion, quitted"
7519,CANTO XXXIII.,"Pisa, and repaired to a manor of his called Settimo; whence, as soon as"
7520,CANTO XXXIII.,"he was informed of Nino’s departure, he returned to Pisa with great"
7521,CANTO XXXIII.,"rejoicing and festivity, and was elevated to the supreme power with"
7522,CANTO XXXIII.,every demonstration of triumph and honour. But his greatness was not of
7523,CANTO XXXIII.,long continuauce. It pleased the Almighty that a total reverse of
7524,CANTO XXXIII.,"fortune should ensue, as a punishment for his acts of treachery and"
7525,CANTO XXXIII.,"guilt: for he was said to have poisoned the Count Anselmo da Capraia,"
7526,CANTO XXXIII.,"his sister’s son, on account of the envy and fear excited in his mind"
7527,CANTO XXXIII.,by the high esteem in which the gracious manners of Anselmo were held
7528,CANTO XXXIII.,"by the Pisans. The power of the Guelphi being so much diminished, the"
7529,CANTO XXXIII.,Archbishop devised means to betray the Count Uglino and caused him to
7530,CANTO XXXIII.,"be suddenly attacked in his palace by the fury of the people, whom he"
7531,CANTO XXXIII.,"had exasperated, by telling them that Ugolino had betrayed Pisa, and"
7532,CANTO XXXIII.,given up their castles to the citizens of Florence and of Lucca. He was
7533,CANTO XXXIII.,immediately compelled to surrender; his bastard son and his grandson
7534,CANTO XXXIII.,"fell in the assault; and two of his sons, with their two sons also,"
7535,CANTO XXXIII.,were conveyed to prison.” G. Villani l. vii. c. 120.
7536,CANTO XXXIII.,
7537,CANTO XXXIII.,"“In the following march, the Pisans, who had imprisoned the Count"
7538,CANTO XXXIII.,"Uglino, with two of his sons and two of his grandchildren, the"
7539,CANTO XXXIII.,"offspring of his son the Count Guelfo, in a tower on the Piazza of the"
7540,CANTO XXXIII.,"Anzania, caused the tower to be locked, the key thrown into the Arno,"
7541,CANTO XXXIII.,and all food to be withheld from them. In a few days they died of
7542,CANTO XXXIII.,"hunger; but the Count first with loud cries declared his penitence, and"
7543,CANTO XXXIII.,"yet neither priest nor friar was allowed to shrive him. All the five,"
7544,CANTO XXXIII.,"when dead, were dragged out of the prison, and meanly interred; and"
7545,CANTO XXXIII.,"from thence forward the tower was called the tower of famine, and so"
7546,CANTO XXXIII.,shall ever be.” Ibid. c. 127.

7585,CANTO XXXIII.,"pretence of wishing to be reconciled, invited them to a banquet, at the"

7820,CANTO I,Toward him turn’d mine eyes. He thus began;
7821,CANTO I,“My son! observant thou my steps pursue.
7822,CANTO I,"We must retreat to rearward, for that way"
7823,CANTO I,The champain to its low extreme declines.”
7824,CANTO I,
7825,CANTO I,"The dawn had chas’d the matin hour of prime,"
7826,CANTO I,"Which deaf before it, so that from afar"
7827,CANTO I,I spy’d the trembling of the ocean stream.
7828,CANTO I,
7829,CANTO I,"We travers’d the deserted plain, as one"
7830,CANTO I,"Who, wander’d from his track, thinks every step"
7831,CANTO I,Trodden in vain till he regain the path.
7832,CANTO I,
7833,CANTO I,"When we had come, where yet the tender dew"
7834,CANTO I,"Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh"
7835,CANTO I,"The wind breath’d o’er it, while it slowly dried;"
7836,CANTO I,Both hands extended on the watery grass
7837,CANTO I,"My master plac’d, in graceful act and kind."
7838,CANTO I,"Whence I of his intent before appriz’d,"
7839,CANTO I,Stretch’d out to him my cheeks suffus’d with tears.
7840,CANTO I,There to my visage he anew restor’d
7841,CANTO I,"That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal’d."
7842,CANTO I,
7843,CANTO I,"Then on the solitary shore arriv’d,"
7844,CANTO I,That never sailing on its waters saw
7845,CANTO I,"Man, that could after measure back his course,"
7846,CANTO I,He girt me in such manner as had pleas’d
7847,CANTO I,"Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!"
7848,CANTO I,"As he selected every humble plant,"
7849,CANTO I,"Wherever one was pluck’d, another there"
7850,CANTO I,"Resembling, straightway in its place arose."
7851,CANTO I,
7852,CANTO I,
7853,CANTO I,
7854,CANTO I,
7855,CANTO II,CANTO II
7856,CANTO II,
7857,CANTO II,
7858,CANTO II,"Now had the sun to that horizon reach’d,"
7859,CANTO II,"That covers, with the most exalted point"
7860,CANTO II,"Of its meridian circle, Salem’s walls,"
7861,CANTO II,"And night, that opposite to him her orb"
7862,CANTO II,"Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,"
7863,CANTO II,"Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp’d"
7864,CANTO II,"When she reigns highest: so that where I was,"
7865,CANTO II,Aurora’s white and vermeil-tinctur’d cheek
7866,CANTO II,To orange turn’d as she in age increas’d.
7867,CANTO II,
7868,CANTO II,"Meanwhile we linger’d by the water’s brink,"
7869,CANTO II,"Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought"
7870,CANTO II,"Journey, while motionless the body rests."
7871,CANTO II,"When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,"
7872,CANTO II,Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
7873,CANTO II,"Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;"
7874,CANTO II,"So seem’d, what once again I hope to view,"
7875,CANTO II,"A light so swiftly coming through the sea,"
7876,CANTO II,No winged course might equal its career.
7877,CANTO II,From which when for a space I had withdrawn
7878,CANTO II,"Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,"
7879,CANTO II,Again I look’d and saw it grown in size
7880,CANTO II,And brightness: thou on either side appear’d
7881,CANTO II,"Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,"
7882,CANTO II,And by degrees from underneath it came
7883,CANTO II,Another. My preceptor silent yet
7884,CANTO II,"Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern’d,"
7885,CANTO II,Open’d the form of wings: then when he knew
7886,CANTO II,"The pilot, cried aloud, “Down, down; bend low"
7887,CANTO II,Thy knees; behold God’s angel: fold thy hands:
7888,CANTO II,Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.
7889,CANTO II,Lo how all human means he sets at naught!
7890,CANTO II,"So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail"
7891,CANTO II,"Except his wings, between such distant shores."
7892,CANTO II,"Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear’d,"
7893,CANTO II,"Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,"
7894,CANTO II,That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!”
7895,CANTO II,
7896,CANTO II,"As more and more toward us came, more bright"
7897,CANTO II,"Appear’d the bird of God, nor could the eye"
7898,CANTO II,Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.
7899,CANTO II,He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
7900,CANTO II,"And light, that in its course no wave it drank."
7901,CANTO II,"The heav’nly steersman at the prow was seen,"
7902,CANTO II,Visibly written blessed in his looks.
7903,CANTO II,Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.
7904,CANTO II,“In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;”
7905,CANTO II,"All with one voice together sang, with what"
7906,CANTO II,In the remainder of that hymn is writ.
7907,CANTO II,Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
7908,CANTO II,"He bless’d them, they at once leap’d out on land,"
7909,CANTO II,"The swiftly as he came return’d. The crew,"
7910,CANTO II,"There left, appear’d astounded with the place,"
7911,CANTO II,Gazing around as one who sees new sights.
7912,CANTO II,
7913,CANTO II,"From every side the sun darted his beams,"
7914,CANTO II,And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav’n
7915,CANTO II,"Had chas’d the Capricorn, when that strange tribe"
7916,CANTO II,"Lifting their eyes towards us: If ye know,"
7917,CANTO II,Declare what path will Lead us to the mount.”
7918,CANTO II,
7919,CANTO II,Them Virgil answer’d. “Ye suppose perchance
7920,CANTO II,"Us well acquainted with this place: but here,"
7921,CANTO II,"We, as yourselves, are strangers. Not long erst"
7922,CANTO II,"We came, before you but a little space,"
7923,CANTO II,"By other road so rough and hard, that now"
7924,CANTO II,"The’ ascent will seem to us as play.” The spirits,"
7925,CANTO II,"Who from my breathing had perceiv’d I liv’d,"
7926,CANTO II,Grew pale with wonder. As the multitude
7927,CANTO II,"Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,"
7928,CANTO II,"To hear what news he brings, and in their haste"
7929,CANTO II,"Tread one another down, e’en so at sight"
7930,CANTO II,"Of me those happy spirits were fix’d, each one"
7931,CANTO II,"Forgetful of its errand, to depart,"
7932,CANTO II,"Where cleans’d from sin, it might be made all fair."
7933,CANTO II,
7934,CANTO II,Then one I saw darting before the rest
7935,CANTO II,"With such fond ardour to embrace me, I"
7936,CANTO II,To do the like was mov’d. O shadows vain
7937,CANTO II,Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands
7938,CANTO II,"I clasp’d behind it, they as oft return’d"
7939,CANTO II,Empty into my breast again. Surprise
7940,CANTO II,"I needs must think was painted in my looks,"
7941,CANTO II,For that the shadow smil’d and backward drew.
7942,CANTO II,"To follow it I hasten’d, but with voice"
7943,CANTO II,Of sweetness it enjoin’d me to desist.
7944,CANTO II,"Then who it was I knew, and pray’d of it,"
7945,CANTO II,"To talk with me, it would a little pause."
7946,CANTO II,It answered: “Thee as in my mortal frame
7947,CANTO II,"I lov’d, so loos’d forth it I love thee still,"
7948,CANTO II,And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?”
7949,CANTO II,
7950,CANTO II,"“Not without purpose once more to return,"
7951,CANTO II,"Thou find’st me, my Casella, where I am"
7952,CANTO II,"Journeying this way;” I said, “but how of thee"
7953,CANTO II,Hath so much time been lost?” He answer’d straight:
7954,CANTO II,"“No outrage hath been done to me, if he"
7955,CANTO II,"Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft"
7956,CANTO II,"This passage hath denied, since of just will"
7957,CANTO II,"His will he makes. These three months past indeed,"
7958,CANTO II,"He, whose chose to enter, with free leave"
7959,CANTO II,Hath taken; whence I wand’ring by the shore
7960,CANTO II,"Where Tyber’s wave grows salt, of him gain’d kind"
7961,CANTO II,"Admittance, at that river’s mouth, tow’rd which"
7962,CANTO II,"His wings are pointed, for there always throng"
7963,CANTO II,All such as not to Archeron descend.”
7964,CANTO II,
7965,CANTO II,Then I: “If new laws have not quite destroy’d
7966,CANTO II,"Memory and use of that sweet song of love,"
7967,CANTO II,That while all my cares had power to ’swage;
7968,CANTO II,Please thee with it a little to console
7969,CANTO II,"My spirit, that incumber’d with its frame,"
7970,CANTO II,"Travelling so far, of pain is overcome.”"
7971,CANTO II,
7972,CANTO II,“Love that discourses in my thoughts.” He then
7973,CANTO II,"Began in such soft accents, that within"
7974,CANTO II,The sweetness thrills me yet. My gentle guide
7975,CANTO II,"And all who came with him, so well were pleas’d,"
7976,CANTO II,That seem’d naught else might in their thoughts have room.
7977,CANTO II,
7978,CANTO II,Fast fix’d in mute attention to his notes
7979,CANTO II,"We stood, when lo! that old man venerable"
7980,CANTO II,"Exclaiming, “How is this, ye tardy spirits?"
7981,CANTO II,What negligence detains you loit’ring here?
7982,CANTO II,"Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,"
7983,CANTO II,That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.”
7984,CANTO II,
7985,CANTO II,"As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food"
7986,CANTO II,"Collected, blade or tares, without their pride"
7987,CANTO II,"Accustom’d, and in still and quiet sort,"
7988,CANTO II,"If aught alarm them, suddenly desert"
7989,CANTO II,"Their meal, assail’d by more important care;"
7990,CANTO II,"So I that new-come troop beheld, the song"
7991,CANTO II,"Deserting, hasten to the mountain’s side,"
7992,CANTO II,As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.
7993,CANTO II,
7994,CANTO II,Nor with less hurried step did we depart.
7995,CANTO II,
7996,CANTO II,
7997,CANTO II,
7998,CANTO II,
7999,CANTO III,CANTO III
8000,CANTO III,
8001,CANTO III,
8002,CANTO III,"Them sudden flight had scatter’d over the plain,"
8003,CANTO III,"Turn’d tow’rds the mountain, whither reason’s voice"
8004,CANTO III,Drives us; I to my faithful company
8005,CANTO III,"Adhering, left it not. For how of him"
8006,CANTO III,"Depriv’d, might I have sped, or who beside"
8007,CANTO III,Would o’er the mountainous tract have led my steps
8008,CANTO III,He with the bitter pang of self-remorse
8009,CANTO III,Seem’d smitten. O clear conscience and upright
8010,CANTO III,How doth a little fling wound thee sore!
8011,CANTO III,
8012,CANTO III,"Soon as his feet desisted (slack’ning pace),"
8013,CANTO III,"From haste, that mars all decency of act,"
8014,CANTO III,"My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,"
8015,CANTO III,"Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor’d:"
8016,CANTO III,And full against the steep ascent I set
8017,CANTO III,"My face, where highest to heav’n its top o’erflows."
8018,CANTO III,
8019,CANTO III,"The sun, that flar’d behind, with ruddy beam"
8020,CANTO III,Before my form was broken; for in me
8021,CANTO III,His rays resistance met. I turn’d aside
8022,CANTO III,"With fear of being left, when I beheld"
8023,CANTO III,Only before myself the ground obscur’d.
8024,CANTO III,"When thus my solace, turning him around,"
8025,CANTO III,Bespake me kindly: “Why distrustest thou?
8026,CANTO III,"Believ’st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?"
8027,CANTO III,"It now is evening there, where buried lies"
8028,CANTO III,"The body, in which I cast a shade, remov’d"
8029,CANTO III,To Naples from Brundusium’s wall. Nor thou
8030,CANTO III,"Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,"
8031,CANTO III,More than that in the sky element
8032,CANTO III,One ray obstructs not other. To endure
8033,CANTO III,"Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames"
8034,CANTO III,"That virtue hath dispos’d, which how it works"
8035,CANTO III,Wills not to us should be reveal’d. Insane
8036,CANTO III,"Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,"
8037,CANTO III,Which holds three persons in one substance knit.
8038,CANTO III,"Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;"
8039,CANTO III,"Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been"
8040,CANTO III,For Mary to bring forth. Moreover ye
8041,CANTO III,Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;
8042,CANTO III,"To whose desires repose would have been giv’n,"
8043,CANTO III,That now but serve them for eternal grief.
8044,CANTO III,"I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,"
8045,CANTO III,And others many more.” And then he bent
8046,CANTO III,"Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood"
8047,CANTO III,Broke off his speech. Meanwhile we had arriv’d
8048,CANTO III,"Far as the mountain’s foot, and there the rock"
8049,CANTO III,"Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps"
8050,CANTO III,To climb it had been vain. The most remote
8051,CANTO III,"Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract"
8052,CANTO III,’Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
8053,CANTO III,A ladder easy’ and open of access.
8054,CANTO III,
8055,CANTO III,“Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?”
8056,CANTO III,"My master said and paus’d, “so that he may"
8057,CANTO III,"Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine,?”"
8058,CANTO III,And while with looks directed to the ground
8059,CANTO III,"The meaning of the pathway he explor’d,"
8060,CANTO III,"And I gaz’d upward round the stony height,"
8061,CANTO III,"Of spirits, that toward us mov’d their steps,"
8062,CANTO III,"Yet moving seem’d not, they so slow approach’d."
8063,CANTO III,
8064,CANTO III,"I thus my guide address’d: “Upraise thine eyes,"
8065,CANTO III,"Lo that way some, of whom thou may’st obtain"
8066,CANTO III,"Counsel, if of thyself thou find’st it not!”"
8067,CANTO III,
8068,CANTO III,"Straightway he look’d, and with free speech replied:"
8069,CANTO III,“Let us tend thither: they but softly come.
8070,CANTO III,"And thou be firm in hope, my son belov’d.”"
8071,CANTO III,
8072,CANTO III,Now was that people distant far in space
8073,CANTO III,"A thousand paces behind ours, as much"
8074,CANTO III,"As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,"
8075,CANTO III,When all drew backward on the messy crags
8076,CANTO III,"Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov’d"
8077,CANTO III,As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.
8078,CANTO III,
8079,CANTO III,“O spirits perfect! O already chosen!”
8080,CANTO III,"Virgil to them began, “by that blest peace,"
8081,CANTO III,"Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar’d,"
8082,CANTO III,"Instruct us where the mountain low declines,"
8083,CANTO III,So that attempt to mount it be not vain.
8084,CANTO III,"For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.”"
8085,CANTO III,
8086,CANTO III,"As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,"
8087,CANTO III,"Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest"
8088,CANTO III,"Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose"
8089,CANTO III,"To ground, and what the foremost does, that do"
8090,CANTO III,"The others, gath’ring round her, if she stops,"
8091,CANTO III,"Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;"
8092,CANTO III,"So saw I moving to advance the first,"
8093,CANTO III,"Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,"
8094,CANTO III,Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.
8095,CANTO III,When they before me had beheld the light
8096,CANTO III,"From my right side fall broken on the ground,"
8097,CANTO III,"So that the shadow reach’d the cave, they stopp’d"
8098,CANTO III,"And somewhat back retir’d: the same did all,"
8099,CANTO III,"Who follow’d, though unweeting of the cause"
8100,CANTO III,
8101,CANTO III,"“Unask’d of you, yet freely I confess,"
8102,CANTO III,This is a human body which ye see.
8103,CANTO III,"That the sun’s light is broken on the ground,"
8104,CANTO III,"Marvel not: but believe, that not without"
8105,CANTO III,"Virtue deriv’d from Heaven, we to climb"
8106,CANTO III,Over this wall aspire.” So them bespake
8107,CANTO III,My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin’d;
8108,CANTO III,"“ Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,”"
8109,CANTO III,Making a signal to us with bent hands.
8110,CANTO III,
8111,CANTO III,"Then of them one began. “Whoe’er thou art,"
8112,CANTO III,"Who journey’st thus this way, thy visage turn,"
8113,CANTO III,Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.”
8114,CANTO III,
8115,CANTO III,"I tow’rds him turn’d, and with fix’d eye beheld."
8116,CANTO III,"Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,"
8117,CANTO III,"He seem’d, but on one brow a gash was mark’d."
8118,CANTO III,
8119,CANTO III,When humbly I disclaim’d to have beheld
8120,CANTO III,"Him ever: “Now behold!” he said, and show’d"
8121,CANTO III,High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.
8122,CANTO III,
8123,CANTO III,"“I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen"
8124,CANTO III,"Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return’d,"
8125,CANTO III,"To my fair daughter go, the parent glad"
8126,CANTO III,Of Aragonia and Sicilia’s pride;
8127,CANTO III,"And of the truth inform her, if of me"
8128,CANTO III,Aught else be told. When by two mortal blows
8129,CANTO III,"My frame was shatter’d, I betook myself"
8130,CANTO III,"Weeping to him, who of free will forgives."
8131,CANTO III,My sins were horrible; but so wide arms
8132,CANTO III,"Hath goodness infinite, that it receives"
8133,CANTO III,All who turn to it. Had this text divine
8134,CANTO III,"Been of Cosenza’s shepherd better scann’d,"
8135,CANTO III,"Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,"
8136,CANTO III,"Yet at the bridge’s head my bones had lain,"
8137,CANTO III,"Near Benevento, by the heavy mole"
8138,CANTO III,"Protected; but the rain now drenches them,"
8139,CANTO III,"And the wind drives, out of the kingdom’s bounds,"
8140,CANTO III,"Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights"
8141,CANTO III,"Extinguish’d, he remov’d them from their bed."
8142,CANTO III,"Yet by their curse we are not so destroy’d,"
8143,CANTO III,"But that the eternal love may turn, while hope"
8144,CANTO III,"Retains her verdant blossoms. True it is,"
8145,CANTO III,That such one as in contumacy dies
8146,CANTO III,"Against the holy church, though he repent,"
8147,CANTO III,Must wander thirty-fold for all the time
8148,CANTO III,In his presumption past; if such decree
8149,CANTO III,Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
8150,CANTO III,Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;
8151,CANTO III,"Revealing to my good Costanza, how"
8152,CANTO III,"Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms"
8153,CANTO III,Laid on me of that interdict; for here
8154,CANTO III,By means of those below much profit comes.”
8155,CANTO III,
8156,CANTO III,
8157,CANTO III,
8158,CANTO III,
8159,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
8160,CANTO IV,
8161,CANTO IV,
8162,CANTO IV,"When by sensations of delight or pain,"
8163,CANTO IV,"That any of our faculties hath seiz’d,"
8164,CANTO IV,"Entire the soul collects herself, it seems"
8165,CANTO IV,"She is intent upon that power alone,"
8166,CANTO IV,And thus the error is disprov’d which holds
8167,CANTO IV,The soul not singly lighted in the breast.
8168,CANTO IV,"And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,"
8169,CANTO IV,"That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn’d,"
8170,CANTO IV,"Time passes, and a man perceives it not."
8171,CANTO IV,"For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,"
8172,CANTO IV,"Another that, which the whole spirit hash;"
8173,CANTO IV,"This is as it were bound, while that is free."
8174,CANTO IV,
8175,CANTO IV,"This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit"
8176,CANTO IV,And wond’ring; for full fifty steps aloft
8177,CANTO IV,"The sun had measur’d unobserv’d of me,"
8178,CANTO IV,When we arriv’d where all with one accord
8179,CANTO IV,"The spirits shouted, “Here is what ye ask.”"
8180,CANTO IV,
8181,CANTO IV,A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp’d
8182,CANTO IV,"With forked stake of thorn by villager,"
8183,CANTO IV,"When the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,"
8184,CANTO IV,"By which my guide, and I behind him close,"
8185,CANTO IV,"Ascended solitary, when that troop"
8186,CANTO IV,Departing left us. On Sanleo’s road
8187,CANTO IV,"Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,"
8188,CANTO IV,"Or mounts Bismantua’s height, must use his feet;"
8189,CANTO IV,"But here a man had need to fly, I mean"
8190,CANTO IV,"With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,"
8191,CANTO IV,"Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,"
8192,CANTO IV,And with light furnish’d to direct my way.
8193,CANTO IV,
8194,CANTO IV,"We through the broken rock ascended, close"
8195,CANTO IV,"Pent on each side, while underneath the ground"
8196,CANTO IV,Ask’d help of hands and feet. When we arriv’d
8197,CANTO IV,"Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,"
8198,CANTO IV,"Where the plain level open’d I exclaim’d,"
8199,CANTO IV,“O master! say which way can we proceed?”
8200,CANTO IV,
8201,CANTO IV,"He answer’d, “Let no step of thine recede."
8202,CANTO IV,"Behind me gain the mountain, till to us"
8203,CANTO IV,Some practis’d guide appear.” That eminence
8204,CANTO IV,"Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,"
8205,CANTO IV,"And the side proudly rising, more than line"
8206,CANTO IV,From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.
8207,CANTO IV,I wearied thus began: “Parent belov’d!
8208,CANTO IV,"Turn, and behold how I remain alone,"
8209,CANTO IV,"If thou stay not.”—” My son!” He straight reply’d,"
8210,CANTO IV,“Thus far put forth thy strength; “and to a track
8211,CANTO IV,"Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round"
8212,CANTO IV,"Circles the hill. His words so spurr’d me on,"
8213,CANTO IV,"That I behind him clamb’ring, forc’d myself,"
8214,CANTO IV,Till my feet press’d the circuit plain beneath.
8215,CANTO IV,"There both together seated, turn’d we round"
8216,CANTO IV,"To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft"
8217,CANTO IV,Many beside have with delight look’d back.
8218,CANTO IV,
8219,CANTO IV,"First on the nether shores I turn’d my eyes,"
8220,CANTO IV,"Then rais’d them to the sun, and wond’ring mark’d"
8221,CANTO IV,That from the left it smote us. Soon perceiv’d
8222,CANTO IV,That Poet sage how at the car of light
8223,CANTO IV,"Amaz’d I stood, where ’twixt us and the north"
8224,CANTO IV,Its course it enter’d. Whence he thus to me:
8225,CANTO IV,“Were Leda’s offspring now in company
8226,CANTO IV,"Of that broad mirror, that high up and low"
8227,CANTO IV,"Imparts his light beneath, thou might’st behold"
8228,CANTO IV,The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears
8229,CANTO IV,"Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook."
8230,CANTO IV,How that may be if thou would’st think; within
8231,CANTO IV,"Pond’ring, imagine Sion with this mount"
8232,CANTO IV,"Plac’d on the earth, so that to both be one"
8233,CANTO IV,"Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,"
8234,CANTO IV,Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
8235,CANTO IV,To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see
8236,CANTO IV,How of necessity by this on one
8237,CANTO IV,"He passes, while by that on the’ other side,"
8238,CANTO IV,If with clear view shine intellect attend.”
8239,CANTO IV,
8240,CANTO IV,"“Of truth, kind teacher!” I exclaim’d, “so clear"
8241,CANTO IV,"Aught saw I never, as I now discern"
8242,CANTO IV,"Where seem’d my ken to fail, that the mid orb"
8243,CANTO IV,Of the supernal motion (which in terms
8244,CANTO IV,"Of art is called the Equator, and remains"
8245,CANTO IV,Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause
8246,CANTO IV,"Thou hast assign’d, from hence toward the north"
8247,CANTO IV,"Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land"
8248,CANTO IV,"Inhabit, see it tow’rds the warmer part."
8249,CANTO IV,"But if it please thee, I would gladly know,"
8250,CANTO IV,How far we have to journey: for the hill
8251,CANTO IV,"Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.”"
8252,CANTO IV,
8253,CANTO IV,"He thus to me: “Such is this steep ascent,"
8254,CANTO IV,"That it is ever difficult at first,"
8255,CANTO IV,"But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows."
8256,CANTO IV,"When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much"
8257,CANTO IV,That upward going shall be easy to thee.
8258,CANTO IV,"As in a vessel to go down the tide,"
8259,CANTO IV,Then of this path thou wilt have reach’d the end.
8260,CANTO IV,There hope to rest thee from thy toil. No more
8261,CANTO IV,"I answer, and thus far for certain know.”"
8262,CANTO IV,"As he his words had spoken, near to us"
8263,CANTO IV,A voice there sounded: “Yet ye first perchance
8264,CANTO IV,May to repose you by constraint be led.”
8265,CANTO IV,"At sound thereof each turn’d, and on the left"
8266,CANTO IV,"A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I"
8267,CANTO IV,"Nor he before was ware. Thither we drew,"
8268,CANTO IV,"find there were some, who in the shady place"
8269,CANTO IV,"Behind the rock were standing, as a man"
8270,CANTO IV,"Thru’ idleness might stand. Among them one,"
8271,CANTO IV,"Who seem’d to me much wearied, sat him down,"
8272,CANTO IV,"And with his arms did fold his knees about,"
8273,CANTO IV,Holding his face between them downward bent.
8274,CANTO IV,
8275,CANTO IV,"“Sweet Sir!” I cry’d, “behold that man, who shows"
8276,CANTO IV,"Himself more idle, than if laziness"
8277,CANTO IV,"Were sister to him.” Straight he turn’d to us,"
8278,CANTO IV,"And, o’er the thigh lifting his face, observ’d,"
8279,CANTO IV,"Then in these accents spake: “Up then, proceed"
8280,CANTO IV,Thou valiant one.” Straight who it was I knew;
8281,CANTO IV,Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath
8282,CANTO IV,Still somewhat urg’d me) hinder my approach.
8283,CANTO IV,"And when I came to him, he scarce his head"
8284,CANTO IV,"Uplifted, saying “Well hast thou discern’d,"
8285,CANTO IV,How from the left the sun his chariot leads.”
8286,CANTO IV,
8287,CANTO IV,His lazy acts and broken words my lips
8288,CANTO IV,To laughter somewhat mov’d; when I began:
8289,CANTO IV,"“Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more."
8290,CANTO IV,"But tell, why thou art seated upright there?"
8291,CANTO IV,Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?
8292,CANTO IV,Or blame I only shine accustom’d ways?”
8293,CANTO IV,"Then he: “My brother, of what use to mount,"
8294,CANTO IV,When to my suffering would not let me pass
8295,CANTO IV,"The bird of God, who at the portal sits?"
8296,CANTO IV,Behooves so long that heav’n first bear me round
8297,CANTO IV,"Without its limits, as in life it bore,"
8298,CANTO IV,Because I to the end repentant Sighs
8299,CANTO IV,"Delay’d, if prayer do not aid me first,"
8300,CANTO IV,That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.
8301,CANTO IV,"What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?”"
8302,CANTO IV,
8303,CANTO IV,Before me now the Poet up the mount
8304,CANTO IV,"Ascending, cried: “Haste thee, for see the sun"
8305,CANTO IV,"Has touch’d the point meridian, and the night"
8306,CANTO IV,Now covers with her foot Marocco’s shore.”
8307,CANTO IV,
8308,CANTO IV,
8309,CANTO IV,
8310,CANTO IV,
8311,CANTO V,CANTO V
8312,CANTO V,
8313,CANTO V,
8314,CANTO V,"Now had I left those spirits, and pursued"
8315,CANTO V,"The steps of my Conductor, when beheld"
8316,CANTO V,Pointing the finger at me one exclaim’d:
8317,CANTO V,“See how it seems as if the light not shone
8318,CANTO V,"From the left hand of him beneath, and he,"
8319,CANTO V,"As living, seems to be led on.” Mine eyes"
8320,CANTO V,"I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze"
8321,CANTO V,"Through wonder first at me, and then at me"
8322,CANTO V,"And the light broken underneath, by turns."
8323,CANTO V,“Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?” my guide
8324,CANTO V,"Exclaim’d, “that thou hast slack’d thy pace? or how"
8325,CANTO V,"Imports it thee, what thing is whisper’d here?"
8326,CANTO V,"Come after me, and to their babblings leave"
8327,CANTO V,"The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,"
8328,CANTO V,Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!
8329,CANTO V,"He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,"
8330,CANTO V,"Still of his aim is wide, in that the one"
8331,CANTO V,Sicklies and wastes to nought the other’s strength.”
8332,CANTO V,
8333,CANTO V,What other could I answer save “I come?”
8334,CANTO V,"I said it, somewhat with that colour ting’d"
8335,CANTO V,Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.
8336,CANTO V,
8337,CANTO V,"Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,"
8338,CANTO V,"A little way before us, some who sang"
8339,CANTO V,The “Miserere” in responsive Strains.
8340,CANTO V,When they perceiv’d that through my body I
8341,CANTO V,"Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song"
8342,CANTO V,Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang’d;
8343,CANTO V,"And two of them, in guise of messengers,"
8344,CANTO V,"Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask’d:"
8345,CANTO V,Of your condition we would gladly learn.”
8346,CANTO V,
8347,CANTO V,"To them my guide. “Ye may return, and bear"
8348,CANTO V,"Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame"
8349,CANTO V,"Is real flesh. If, as I deem, to view"
8350,CANTO V,"His shade they paus’d, enough is answer’d them."
8351,CANTO V,"Him let them honour, they may prize him well.”"
8352,CANTO V,
8353,CANTO V,Ne’er saw I fiery vapours with such speed
8354,CANTO V,"Cut through the serene air at fall of night,"
8355,CANTO V,"Nor August’s clouds athwart the setting sun,"
8356,CANTO V,That upward these did not in shorter space
8357,CANTO V,"Return; and, there arriving, with the rest"
8358,CANTO V,"Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop."
8359,CANTO V,
8360,CANTO V,"“Many,” exclaim’d the bard, “are these, who throng"
8361,CANTO V,Around us: to petition thee they come.
8362,CANTO V,"Go therefore on, and listen as thou go’st.”"
8363,CANTO V,
8364,CANTO V,“O spirit! who go’st on to blessedness
8365,CANTO V,"With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth.”"
8366,CANTO V,"Shouting they came, “a little rest thy step."
8367,CANTO V,Look if thou any one amongst our tribe
8368,CANTO V,"Hast e’er beheld, that tidings of him there"
8369,CANTO V,"Thou mayst report. Ah, wherefore go’st thou on?"
8370,CANTO V,Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? We all
8371,CANTO V,"By violence died, and to our latest hour"
8372,CANTO V,"Were sinners, but then warn’d by light from heav’n,"
8373,CANTO V,"So that, repenting and forgiving, we"
8374,CANTO V,"Did issue out of life at peace with God,"
8375,CANTO V,Who with desire to see him fills our heart.”
8376,CANTO V,
8377,CANTO V,Then I: “The visages of all I scan
8378,CANTO V,"Yet none of ye remember. But if aught,"
8379,CANTO V,"That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!"
8380,CANTO V,"Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,"
8381,CANTO V,Which on the steps of guide so excellent
8382,CANTO V,Following from world to world intent I seek.”
8383,CANTO V,
8384,CANTO V,In answer he began: “None here distrusts
8385,CANTO V,"Thy kindness, though not promis’d with an oath;"
8386,CANTO V,So as the will fail not for want of power.
8387,CANTO V,"Whence I, who sole before the others speak,"
8388,CANTO V,"Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,"
8389,CANTO V,Which lies between Romagna and the realm
8390,CANTO V,"Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray"
8391,CANTO V,"Those who inhabit Fano, that for me"
8392,CANTO V,"Their adorations duly be put up,"
8393,CANTO V,By which I may purge off my grievous sins.
8394,CANTO V,"From thence I came. But the deep passages,"
8395,CANTO V,"Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,"
8396,CANTO V,Upon my bosom in Antenor’s land
8397,CANTO V,"Were made, where to be more secure I thought."
8398,CANTO V,"The author of the deed was Este’s prince,"
8399,CANTO V,"Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath"
8400,CANTO V,"Pursued me. Had I towards Mira fled,"
8401,CANTO V,"When overta’en at Oriaco, still"
8402,CANTO V,"Might I have breath’d. But to the marsh I sped,"
8403,CANTO V,And in the mire and rushes tangled there
8404,CANTO V,"Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.”"
8405,CANTO V,
8406,CANTO V,"Then said another: “Ah! so may the wish,"
8407,CANTO V,"That takes thee o’er the mountain, be fulfill’d,"
8408,CANTO V,As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.
8409,CANTO V,Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:
8410,CANTO V,"Giovanna nor none else have care for me,"
8411,CANTO V,Sorrowing with these I therefore go.” I thus:
8412,CANTO V,“From Campaldino’s field what force or chance
8413,CANTO V,"Drew thee, that ne’er thy sepulture was known?”"
8414,CANTO V,
8415,CANTO V,"“Oh!” answer’d he, “at Casentino’s foot"
8416,CANTO V,"A stream there courseth, nam’d Archiano, sprung"
8417,CANTO V,In Apennine above the Hermit’s seat.
8418,CANTO V,"E’en where its name is cancel’d, there came I,"
8419,CANTO V,"Pierc’d in the heart, fleeing away on foot,"
8420,CANTO V,And bloodying the plain. Here sight and speech
8421,CANTO V,"Fail’d me, and finishing with Mary’s name"
8422,CANTO V,"I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain’d."
8423,CANTO V,I will report the truth; which thou again0
8424,CANTO V,"Tell to the living. Me God’s angel took,"
8425,CANTO V,Whilst he of hell exclaim’d: “O thou from heav’n!
8426,CANTO V,Say wherefore hast thou robb’d me? Thou of him
8427,CANTO V,Th’ eternal portion bear’st with thee away
8428,CANTO V,For one poor tear that he deprives me of.
8429,CANTO V,"But of the other, other rule I make.”"
8430,CANTO V,
8431,CANTO V,“Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects
8432,CANTO V,"That vapour dank, returning into water,"
8433,CANTO V,Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.
8434,CANTO V,"That evil will, which in his intellect"
8435,CANTO V,"Still follows evil, came, and rais’d the wind"
8436,CANTO V,"And smoky mist, by virtue of the power"
8437,CANTO V,"Given by his nature. Thence the valley, soon"
8438,CANTO V,"As day was spent, he cover’d o’er with cloud"
8439,CANTO V,"From Pratomagno to the mountain range,"
8440,CANTO V,"And stretch’d the sky above, so that the air"
8441,CANTO V,"Impregnate chang’d to water. Fell the rain,"
8442,CANTO V,And to the fosses came all that the land
8443,CANTO V,"Contain’d not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,"
8444,CANTO V,To the great river with such headlong sweep
8445,CANTO V,"Rush’d, that nought stay’d its course. My stiffen’d frame"
8446,CANTO V,"Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,"
8447,CANTO V,"And dash’d it into Arno, from my breast"
8448,CANTO V,"Loos’ning the cross, that of myself I made"
8449,CANTO V,"When overcome with pain. He hurl’d me on,"
8450,CANTO V,Along the banks and bottom of his course;
8451,CANTO V,Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt.”
8452,CANTO V,
8453,CANTO V,"“Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return’d,"
8454,CANTO V,"And rested after thy long road,” so spake"
8455,CANTO V,Next the third spirit; “then remember me.
8456,CANTO V,"I once was Pia. Sienna gave me life,"
8457,CANTO V,"Maremma took it from me. That he knows,"
8458,CANTO V,Who me with jewell’d ring had first espous’d.”
8459,CANTO V,
8460,CANTO V,
8461,CANTO V,
8462,CANTO V,
8463,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
8464,CANTO VI,
8465,CANTO VI,
8466,CANTO VI,"When from their game of dice men separate,"
8467,CANTO VI,"He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix’d,"
8468,CANTO VI,"Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws"
8469,CANTO VI,He cast: but meanwhile all the company
8470,CANTO VI,"Go with the other; one before him runs,"
8471,CANTO VI,"And one behind his mantle twitches, one"
8472,CANTO VI,Fast by his side bids him remember him.
8473,CANTO VI,"He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand"
8474,CANTO VI,"Is stretch’d, well knows he bids him stand aside;"
8475,CANTO VI,And thus he from the press defends himself.
8476,CANTO VI,E’en such was I in that close-crowding throng;
8477,CANTO VI,"And turning so my face around to all,"
8478,CANTO VI,"And promising, I ’scap’d from it with pains."
8479,CANTO VI,
8480,CANTO VI,"Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell"
8481,CANTO VI,"By Ghino’s cruel arm; and him beside,"
8482,CANTO VI,Who in his chase was swallow’d by the stream.
8483,CANTO VI,"Here Frederic Novello, with his hand"
8484,CANTO VI,"Stretch’d forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,"
8485,CANTO VI,Who put the good Marzuco to such proof
8486,CANTO VI,Of constancy. Count Orso I beheld;
8487,CANTO VI,And from its frame a soul dismiss’d for spite
8488,CANTO VI,"And envy, as it said, but for no crime:"
8489,CANTO VI,"I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,"
8490,CANTO VI,"While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant"
8491,CANTO VI,Let her beware; lest for so false a deed
8492,CANTO VI,She herd with worse than these. When I was freed
8493,CANTO VI,"From all those spirits, who pray’d for others’ prayers"
8494,CANTO VI,To hasten on their state of blessedness;
8495,CANTO VI,"Straight I began: “O thou, my luminary!"
8496,CANTO VI,"It seems expressly in thy text denied,"
8497,CANTO VI,That heaven’s supreme decree can never bend
8498,CANTO VI,To supplication; yet with this design
8499,CANTO VI,"Do these entreat. Can then their hope be vain,"
8500,CANTO VI,Or is thy saying not to me reveal’d?”
8501,CANTO VI,
8502,CANTO VI,"He thus to me: “Both what I write is plain,"
8503,CANTO VI,"And these deceiv’d not in their hope, if well"
8504,CANTO VI,"Thy mind consider, that the sacred height"
8505,CANTO VI,"Of judgment doth not stoop, because love’s flame"
8506,CANTO VI,"In a short moment all fulfils, which he"
8507,CANTO VI,"Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy."
8508,CANTO VI,"Besides, when I this point concluded thus,"
8509,CANTO VI,By praying no defect could be supplied;
8510,CANTO VI,Because the pray’r had none access to God.
8511,CANTO VI,Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not
8512,CANTO VI,"Contented unless she assure thee so,"
8513,CANTO VI,Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.
8514,CANTO VI,I know not if thou take me right; I mean
8515,CANTO VI,"Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above,"
8516,CANTO VI,"Upon this mountain’s crown, fair seat of joy.”"
8517,CANTO VI,
8518,CANTO VI,Then I: “Sir! let us mend our speed; for now
8519,CANTO VI,I tire not as before; and lo! the hill
8520,CANTO VI,Stretches its shadow far.” He answer’d thus:
8521,CANTO VI,“Our progress with this day shall be as much
8522,CANTO VI,As we may now dispatch; but otherwise
8523,CANTO VI,Than thou supposest is the truth. For there
8524,CANTO VI,"Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold"
8525,CANTO VI,"Him back returning, who behind the steep"
8526,CANTO VI,"Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam"
8527,CANTO VI,Thou dost not break. But lo! a spirit there
8528,CANTO VI,"Stands solitary, and toward us looks:"
8529,CANTO VI,It will instruct us in the speediest way.”
8530,CANTO VI,
8531,CANTO VI,We soon approach’d it. O thou Lombard spirit!
8532,CANTO VI,"How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,"
8533,CANTO VI,Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!
8534,CANTO VI,"It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,"
8535,CANTO VI,Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.
8536,CANTO VI,"I3ut Virgil with entreaty mild advanc’d,"
8537,CANTO VI,Requesting it to show the best ascent.
8538,CANTO VI,"It answer to his question none return’d,"
8539,CANTO VI,But of our country and our kind of life
8540,CANTO VI,"Demanded. When my courteous guide began,"
8541,CANTO VI,"“Mantua,” the solitary shadow quick"
8542,CANTO VI,"Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,"
8543,CANTO VI,"And cry’d, “Mantuan! I am thy countryman"
8544,CANTO VI,Sordello.” Each the other then embrac’d.
8545,CANTO VI,
8546,CANTO VI,"Ah slavish Italy! thou inn of grief,"
8547,CANTO VI,"Vessel without a pilot in loud storm,"
8548,CANTO VI,"Lady no longer of fair provinces,"
8549,CANTO VI,"But brothel-house impure! this gentle spirit,"
8550,CANTO VI,Ev’n from the Pleasant sound of his dear land
8551,CANTO VI,Was prompt to greet a fellow citizen
8552,CANTO VI,With such glad cheer; while now thy living ones
8553,CANTO VI,In thee abide not without war; and one
8554,CANTO VI,"Malicious gnaws another, ay of those"
8555,CANTO VI,"Whom the same wall and the same moat contains,"
8556,CANTO VI,"Seek, wretched one! around thy sea-coasts wide;"
8557,CANTO VI,"Then homeward to thy bosom turn, and mark"
8558,CANTO VI,If any part of the sweet peace enjoy.
8559,CANTO VI,"What boots it, that thy reins Justinian’s hand"
8560,CANTO VI,"Befitted, if thy saddle be unpress’d?"
8561,CANTO VI,Nought doth he now but aggravate thy shame.
8562,CANTO VI,"Ah people! thou obedient still shouldst live,"
8563,CANTO VI,"And in the saddle let thy Caesar sit,"
8564,CANTO VI,If well thou marked’st that which God commands
8565,CANTO VI,
8566,CANTO VI,Look how that beast to felness hath relaps’d
8567,CANTO VI,"From having lost correction of the spur,"
8568,CANTO VI,"Since to the bridle thou hast set thine hand,"
8569,CANTO VI,"O German Albert! who abandon’st her,"
8570,CANTO VI,"That is grown savage and unmanageable,"
8571,CANTO VI,When thou should’st clasp her flanks with forked heels.
8572,CANTO VI,Just judgment from the stars fall on thy blood!
8573,CANTO VI,And be it strange and manifest to all!
8574,CANTO VI,Such as may strike thy successor with dread!
8575,CANTO VI,"For that thy sire and thou have suffer’d thus,"
8576,CANTO VI,"Through greediness of yonder realms detain’d,"
8577,CANTO VI,The garden of the empire to run waste.
8578,CANTO VI,"Come see the Capulets and Montagues,"
8579,CANTO VI,The Philippeschi and Monaldi! man
8580,CANTO VI,"Who car’st for nought! those sunk in grief, and these"
8581,CANTO VI,"With dire suspicion rack’d. Come, cruel one!"
8582,CANTO VI,"Come and behold the’ oppression of the nobles,"
8583,CANTO VI,And mark their injuries: and thou mayst see.
8584,CANTO VI,What safety Santafiore can supply.
8585,CANTO VI,"Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,"
8586,CANTO VI,Desolate widow! day and night with moans:
8587,CANTO VI,"“My Caesar, why dost thou desert my side?”"
8588,CANTO VI,Come and behold what love among thy people:
8589,CANTO VI,"And if no pity touches thee for us,"
8590,CANTO VI,"Come and blush for thine own report. For me,"
8591,CANTO VI,"If it be lawful, O Almighty Power,"
8592,CANTO VI,Who wast in earth for our sakes crucified!
8593,CANTO VI,Are thy just eyes turn’d elsewhere? or is this
8594,CANTO VI,A preparation in the wond’rous depth
8595,CANTO VI,"Of thy sage counsel made, for some good end,"
8596,CANTO VI,Entirely from our reach of thought cut off?
8597,CANTO VI,So are the’ Italian cities all o’erthrong’d
8598,CANTO VI,"With tyrants, and a great Marcellus made"
8599,CANTO VI,Of every petty factious villager.
8600,CANTO VI,
8601,CANTO VI,My Florence! thou mayst well remain unmov’d
8602,CANTO VI,"At this digression, which affects not thee:"
8603,CANTO VI,"Thanks to thy people, who so wisely speed."
8604,CANTO VI,"Many have justice in their heart, that long"
8605,CANTO VI,"Waiteth for counsel to direct the bow,"
8606,CANTO VI,Or ere it dart unto its aim: but shine
8607,CANTO VI,Have it on their lip’s edge. Many refuse
8608,CANTO VI,To bear the common burdens: readier thine
8609,CANTO VI,"Answer uneall’d, and cry, “Behold I stoop!”"
8610,CANTO VI,
8611,CANTO VI,"Make thyself glad, for thou hast reason now,"
8612,CANTO VI,Thou wealthy! thou at peace! thou wisdom-fraught!
8613,CANTO VI,Facts best witness if I speak the truth.
8614,CANTO VI,"Athens and Lacedaemon, who of old"
8615,CANTO VI,"Enacted laws, for civil arts renown’d,"
8616,CANTO VI,Made little progress in improving life
8617,CANTO VI,"Tow’rds thee, who usest such nice subtlety,"
8618,CANTO VI,That to the middle of November scarce
8619,CANTO VI,Reaches the thread thou in October weav’st.
8620,CANTO VI,"How many times, within thy memory,"
8621,CANTO VI,"Customs, and laws, and coins, and offices"
8622,CANTO VI,"Have been by thee renew’d, and people chang’d!"
8623,CANTO VI,
8624,CANTO VI,"If thou remember’st well and can’st see clear,"
8625,CANTO VI,"Thou wilt perceive thyself like a sick wretch,"
8626,CANTO VI,"Who finds no rest upon her down, hut oft"
8627,CANTO VI,"Shifting her side, short respite seeks from pain."
8628,CANTO VI,
8629,CANTO VI,
8630,CANTO VI,
8631,CANTO VI,
8632,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
8633,CANTO VII,
8634,CANTO VII,
8635,CANTO VII,After their courteous greetings joyfully
8636,CANTO VII,"Sev’n times exchang’d, Sordello backward drew"
8637,CANTO VII,"Exclaiming, “Who are ye?” “Before this mount"
8638,CANTO VII,By spirits worthy of ascent to God
8639,CANTO VII,"Was sought, my bones had by Octavius’ care"
8640,CANTO VII,"Been buried. I am Virgil, for no sin"
8641,CANTO VII,"Depriv’d of heav’n, except for lack of faith.”"
8642,CANTO VII,
8643,CANTO VII,So answer’d him in few my gentle guide.
8644,CANTO VII,
8645,CANTO VII,"As one, who aught before him suddenly"
8646,CANTO VII,"Beholding, whence his wonder riseth, cries"
8647,CANTO VII,"“It is yet is not,” wav’ring in belief;"
8648,CANTO VII,"Such he appear’d; then downward bent his eyes,"
8649,CANTO VII,"And drawing near with reverential step,"
8650,CANTO VII,"Caught him, where of mean estate might clasp"
8651,CANTO VII,"His lord. “Glory of Latium!” he exclaim’d,"
8652,CANTO VII,“In whom our tongue its utmost power display’d!
8653,CANTO VII,Boast of my honor’d birth-place! what desert
8654,CANTO VII,"Of mine, what favour rather undeserv’d,"
8655,CANTO VII,Shows thee to me? If I to hear that voice
8656,CANTO VII,"Am worthy, say if from below thou com’st"
8657,CANTO VII,And from what cloister’s pale?”—“Through every orb
8658,CANTO VII,"Of that sad region,” he reply’d, “thus far"
8659,CANTO VII,"Am I arriv’d, by heav’nly influence led"
8660,CANTO VII,And with such aid I come. There is a place
8661,CANTO VII,"There underneath, not made by torments sad,"
8662,CANTO VII,But by dun shades alone; where mourning’s voice
8663,CANTO VII,"Sounds not of anguish sharp, but breathes in sighs."
8664,CANTO VII,"There I with little innocents abide,"
8665,CANTO VII,"Who by death’s fangs were bitten, ere exempt"
8666,CANTO VII,"From human taint. There I with those abide,"
8667,CANTO VII,"Who the three holy virtues put not on,"
8668,CANTO VII,"But understood the rest, and without blame"
8669,CANTO VII,"Follow’d them all. But if thou know’st and canst,"
8670,CANTO VII,"Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,"
8671,CANTO VII,Where Purgatory its true beginning takes.”
8672,CANTO VII,
8673,CANTO VII,He answer’d thus: “We have no certain place
8674,CANTO VII,"Assign’d us: upwards I may go or round,"
8675,CANTO VII,"Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide."
8676,CANTO VII,But thou beholdest now how day declines:
8677,CANTO VII,"And upwards to proceed by night, our power"
8678,CANTO VII,Excels: therefore it may be well to choose
8679,CANTO VII,A place of pleasant sojourn. To the right
8680,CANTO VII,Some spirits sit apart retir’d. If thou
8681,CANTO VII,"Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:"
8682,CANTO VII,"And thou wilt know them, not without delight.”"
8683,CANTO VII,
8684,CANTO VII,“How chances this?” was answer’d; “who so wish’d
8685,CANTO VII,"To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr’d"
8686,CANTO VII,"By other, or through his own weakness fail?”"
8687,CANTO VII,
8688,CANTO VII,"The good Sordello then, along the ground"
8689,CANTO VII,"Trailing his finger, spoke: “Only this line"
8690,CANTO VII,"Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun"
8691,CANTO VII,Hath disappear’d; not that aught else impedes
8692,CANTO VII,"Thy going upwards, save the shades of night."
8693,CANTO VII,These with the wont of power perplex the will.
8694,CANTO VII,"With them thou haply mightst return beneath,"
8695,CANTO VII,Or to and fro around the mountain’s side
8696,CANTO VII,"Wander, while day is in the horizon shut.”"
8697,CANTO VII,
8698,CANTO VII,"My master straight, as wond’ring at his speech,"
8699,CANTO VII,"Exclaim’d: “Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,"
8700,CANTO VII,"That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight.”"
8701,CANTO VII,
8702,CANTO VII,"A little space we were remov’d from thence,"
8703,CANTO VII,When I perceiv’d the mountain hollow’d out.
8704,CANTO VII,"Ev’n as large valleys hollow’d out on earth,"
8705,CANTO VII,
8706,CANTO VII,"“That way,” the’ escorting spirit cried, “we go,"
8707,CANTO VII,Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:
8708,CANTO VII,And thou await renewal of the day.”
8709,CANTO VII,
8710,CANTO VII,Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path
8711,CANTO VII,"Led us traverse into the ridge’s side,"
8712,CANTO VII,Where more than half the sloping edge expires.
8713,CANTO VII,"Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin’d,"
8714,CANTO VII,"And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood"
8715,CANTO VII,"Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds"
8716,CANTO VII,"But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers"
8717,CANTO VII,"Plac’d in that fair recess, in color all"
8718,CANTO VII,"Had been surpass’d, as great surpasses less."
8719,CANTO VII,"Nor nature only there lavish’d her hues,"
8720,CANTO VII,But of the sweetness of a thousand smells
8721,CANTO VII,A rare and undistinguish’d fragrance made.
8722,CANTO VII,
8723,CANTO VII,"“Salve Regina,” on the grass and flowers"
8724,CANTO VII,Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit
8725,CANTO VII,Who not beyond the valley could be seen.
8726,CANTO VII,
8727,CANTO VII,"“Before the west’ring sun sink to his bed,”"
8728,CANTO VII,"Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn’d,"
8729,CANTO VII,
8730,CANTO VII,“’Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.
8731,CANTO VII,For from this eminence ye shall discern
8732,CANTO VII,"Better the acts and visages of all,"
8733,CANTO VII,Than in the nether vale among them mix’d.
8734,CANTO VII,"He, who sits high above the rest, and seems"
8735,CANTO VII,"To have neglected that he should have done,"
8736,CANTO VII,"And to the others’ song moves not his lip,"
8737,CANTO VII,"The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal’d"
8738,CANTO VII,"The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,"
8739,CANTO VII,"So that by others she revives but slowly,"
8740,CANTO VII,"He, who with kindly visage comforts him,"
8741,CANTO VII,"Sway’d in that country, where the water springs,"
8742,CANTO VII,"That Moldaw’s river to the Elbe, and Elbe"
8743,CANTO VII,Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:
8744,CANTO VII,Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth
8745,CANTO VII,"Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,"
8746,CANTO VII,Pamper’d with rank luxuriousness and ease.
8747,CANTO VII,"And that one with the nose depress, who close"
8748,CANTO VII,"In counsel seems with him of gentle look,"
8749,CANTO VII,"Flying expir’d, with’ring the lily’s flower."
8750,CANTO VII,Look there how he doth knock against his breast!
8751,CANTO VII,"The other ye behold, who for his cheek"
8752,CANTO VII,"Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs."
8753,CANTO VII,They are the father and the father-in-law
8754,CANTO VII,Of Gallia’s bane: his vicious life they know
8755,CANTO VII,And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.
8756,CANTO VII,
8757,CANTO VII,"“He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps"
8758,CANTO VII,"In song, with him of feature prominent,"
8759,CANTO VII,With ev’ry virtue bore his girdle brac’d.
8760,CANTO VII,"And if that stripling who behinds him sits,"
8761,CANTO VII,"King after him had liv’d, his virtue then"
8762,CANTO VII,From vessel to like vessel had been pour’d;
8763,CANTO VII,Which may not of the other heirs be said.
8764,CANTO VII,By James and Frederick his realms are held;
8765,CANTO VII,Neither the better heritage obtains.
8766,CANTO VII,Rarely into the branches of the tree
8767,CANTO VII,Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains
8768,CANTO VII,"He who bestows it, that as his free gift"
8769,CANTO VII,It may be call’d. To Charles my words apply
8770,CANTO VII,No less than to his brother in the song;
8771,CANTO VII,Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.
8772,CANTO VII,"So much that plant degenerates from its seed,"
8773,CANTO VII,As more than Beatrice and Margaret
8774,CANTO VII,Costanza still boasts of her valorous spouse.
8775,CANTO VII,
8776,CANTO VII,"“Behold the king of simple life and plain,"
8777,CANTO VII,"Harry of England, sitting there alone:"
8778,CANTO VII,He through his branches better issue spreads.
8779,CANTO VII,
8780,CANTO VII,"“That one, who on the ground beneath the rest"
8781,CANTO VII,"Sits lowest, yet his gaze directs aloft,"
8782,CANTO VII,"Us William, that brave Marquis, for whose cause"
8783,CANTO VII,The deed of Alexandria and his war
8784,CANTO VII,Makes Conferrat and Canavese weep.”
8785,CANTO VII,
8786,CANTO VII,
8787,CANTO VII,
8788,CANTO VII,
8789,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
8790,CANTO VIII,
8791,CANTO VIII,
8792,CANTO VIII,Now was the hour that wakens fond desire
8793,CANTO VIII,"In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,"
8794,CANTO VIII,"Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,"
8795,CANTO VIII,And pilgrim newly on his road with love
8796,CANTO VIII,"Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,"
8797,CANTO VIII,That seems to mourn for the expiring day:
8798,CANTO VIII,"When I, no longer taking heed to hear"
8799,CANTO VIII,"Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark"
8800,CANTO VIII,"One risen from its seat, which with its hand"
8801,CANTO VIII,"Audience implor’d. Both palms it join’d and rais’d,"
8802,CANTO VIII,"Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,"
8803,CANTO VIII,"As telling God, “I care for naught beside.”"
8804,CANTO VIII,
8805,CANTO VIII,"“Te Lucis Ante,” so devoutly then"
8806,CANTO VIII,"Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,"
8807,CANTO VIII,That all my sense in ravishment was lost.
8808,CANTO VIII,"And the rest after, softly and devout,"
8809,CANTO VIII,"Follow’d through all the hymn, with upward gaze"
8810,CANTO VIII,Directed to the bright supernal wheels.
8811,CANTO VIII,
8812,CANTO VIII,"Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:"
8813,CANTO VIII,"For of so subtle texture is this veil,"
8814,CANTO VIII,That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark’d.
8815,CANTO VIII,
8816,CANTO VIII,I saw that gentle band silently next
8817,CANTO VIII,"Look up, as if in expectation held,"
8818,CANTO VIII,Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high
8819,CANTO VIII,I saw forth issuing descend beneath
8820,CANTO VIII,"Two angels with two flame-illumin’d swords,"
8821,CANTO VIII,Broken and mutilated at their points.
8822,CANTO VIII,"Green as the tender leaves but newly born,"
8823,CANTO VIII,"Their vesture was, the which by wings as green"
8824,CANTO VIII,"Beaten, they drew behind them, fann’d in air."
8825,CANTO VIII,"A little over us one took his stand,"
8826,CANTO VIII,"The other lighted on the’ Opposing hill,"
8827,CANTO VIII,So that the troop were in the midst contain’d.
8828,CANTO VIII,
8829,CANTO VIII,Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;
8830,CANTO VIII,But in their visages the dazzled eye
8831,CANTO VIII,"Was lost, as faculty that by too much"
8832,CANTO VIII,Is overpower’d. “From Mary’s bosom both
8833,CANTO VIII,"Are come,” exclaim’d Sordello, “as a guard"
8834,CANTO VIII,"Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,"
8835,CANTO VIII,"The serpent.” Whence, not knowing by which path"
8836,CANTO VIII,"He came, I turn’d me round, and closely press’d,"
8837,CANTO VIII,"All frozen, to my leader’s trusted side."
8838,CANTO VIII,
8839,CANTO VIII,Sordello paus’d not: “To the valley now
8840,CANTO VIII,(For it is time) let us descend; and hold
8841,CANTO VIII,Converse with those great shadows: haply much
8842,CANTO VIII,Their sight may please ye.” Only three steps down
8843,CANTO VIII,"Methinks I measur’d, ere I was beneath,"
8844,CANTO VIII,And noted one who look’d as with desire
8845,CANTO VIII,To know me. Time was now that air arrow dim;
8846,CANTO VIII,"Yet not so dim, that ’twixt his eyes and mine"
8847,CANTO VIII,It clear’d not up what was conceal’d before.
8848,CANTO VIII,Mutually tow’rds each other we advanc’d.
8849,CANTO VIII,"Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,"
8850,CANTO VIII,When I perceiv’d thou wert not with the bad!
8851,CANTO VIII,
8852,CANTO VIII,No salutation kind on either part
8853,CANTO VIII,Was left unsaid. He then inquir’d: “How long
8854,CANTO VIII,"Since thou arrived’st at the mountain’s foot,"
8855,CANTO VIII,"Over the distant waves?”—“O!” answer’d I,"
8856,CANTO VIII,"“Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,"
8857,CANTO VIII,"And still in my first life, thus journeying on,"
8858,CANTO VIII,The other strive to gain.” Soon as they heard
8859,CANTO VIII,"My words, he and Sordello backward drew,"
8860,CANTO VIII,"As suddenly amaz’d. To Virgil one,"
8861,CANTO VIII,"The other to a spirit turn’d, who near"
8862,CANTO VIII,"Was seated, crying: “Conrad! up with speed:"
8863,CANTO VIII,"Come, see what of his grace high God hath will’d.”"
8864,CANTO VIII,Then turning round to me: “By that rare mark
8865,CANTO VIII,"Of honour which thou ow’st to him, who hides"
8866,CANTO VIII,"So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,"
8867,CANTO VIII,When thou shalt he beyond the vast of waves.
8868,CANTO VIII,"Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call"
8869,CANTO VIII,"There, where reply to innocence is made."
8870,CANTO VIII,"Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;"
8871,CANTO VIII,"Since she has chang’d the white and wimpled folds,"
8872,CANTO VIII,Which she is doom’d once more with grief to wish.
8873,CANTO VIII,"By her it easily may be perceiv’d,"
8874,CANTO VIII,"How long in women lasts the flame of love,"
8875,CANTO VIII,If sight and touch do not relume it oft.
8876,CANTO VIII,For her so fair a burial will not make
8877,CANTO VIII,"The viper which calls Milan to the field,"
8878,CANTO VIII,As had been made by shrill Gallura’s bird.”
8879,CANTO VIII,
8880,CANTO VIII,"He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp"
8881,CANTO VIII,"Of that right seal, which with due temperature"
8882,CANTO VIII,Glows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes
8883,CANTO VIII,"Meanwhile to heav’n had travel’d, even there"
8884,CANTO VIII,"Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel"
8885,CANTO VIII,Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir’d:
8886,CANTO VIII,"“What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?”"
8887,CANTO VIII,
8888,CANTO VIII,"I answer’d: “The three torches, with which here"
8889,CANTO VIII,The pole is all on fire. “He then to me:
8890,CANTO VIII,"“The four resplendent stars, thou saw’st this morn"
8891,CANTO VIII,"Are there beneath, and these ris’n in their stead.”"
8892,CANTO VIII,
8893,CANTO VIII,While yet he spoke. Sordello to himself
8894,CANTO VIII,"Drew him, and cry’d: “Lo there our enemy!”"
8895,CANTO VIII,And with his hand pointed that way to look.
8896,CANTO VIII,
8897,CANTO VIII,"Along the side, where barrier none arose"
8898,CANTO VIII,"Around the little vale, a serpent lay,"
8899,CANTO VIII,Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.
8900,CANTO VIII,"Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake"
8901,CANTO VIII,"Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;"
8902,CANTO VIII,"And, as a beast that smoothes its polish’d coat,"
8903,CANTO VIII,"Licking his hack. I saw not, nor can tell,"
8904,CANTO VIII,How those celestial falcons from their seat
8905,CANTO VIII,"Mov’d, but in motion each one well descried,"
8906,CANTO VIII,Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.
8907,CANTO VIII,The serpent fled; and to their stations back
8908,CANTO VIII,The angels up return’d with equal flight.
8909,CANTO VIII,
8910,CANTO VIII,"The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call’d,"
8911,CANTO VIII,"Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,"
8912,CANTO VIII,"Through all that conflict, loosen’d not his sight."
8913,CANTO VIII,
8914,CANTO VIII,"“So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,"
8915,CANTO VIII,"Find, in thy destin’d lot, of wax so much,"
8916,CANTO VIII,As may suffice thee to the enamel’s height.”
8917,CANTO VIII,It thus began: “If any certain news
8918,CANTO VIII,Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part
8919,CANTO VIII,"Thou know’st, tell me, who once was mighty there"
8920,CANTO VIII,"They call’d me Conrad Malaspina, not"
8921,CANTO VIII,"That old one, but from him I sprang. The love"
8922,CANTO VIII,I bore my people is now here refin’d.”
8923,CANTO VIII,
8924,CANTO VIII,"“In your dominions,” I answer’d, “ne’er was I."
8925,CANTO VIII,"But through all Europe where do those men dwell,"
8926,CANTO VIII,To whom their glory is not manifest?
8927,CANTO VIII,"The fame, that honours your illustrious house,"
8928,CANTO VIII,Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;
8929,CANTO VIII,So that he knows it who was never there.
8930,CANTO VIII,"I swear to you, so may my upward route"
8931,CANTO VIII,Prosper! your honour’d nation not impairs
8932,CANTO VIII,The value of her coffer and her sword.
8933,CANTO VIII,"Nature and use give her such privilege,"
8934,CANTO VIII,That while the world is twisted from his course
8935,CANTO VIII,"By a bad head, she only walks aright,"
8936,CANTO VIII,And has the evil way in scorn.” He then:
8937,CANTO VIII,“Now pass thee on: sev’n times the tired sun
8938,CANTO VIII,"Revisits not the couch, which with four feet"
8939,CANTO VIII,"The forked Aries covers, ere that kind"
8940,CANTO VIII,Opinion shall be nail’d into thy brain
8941,CANTO VIII,"With stronger nails than other’s speech can drive,"
8942,CANTO VIII,If the sure course of judgment be not stay’d.”

8950,CANTO IX,"Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,"
8951,CANTO IX,"Arisen from her mate’s beloved arms,"
8952,CANTO IX,"Look’d palely o’er the eastern cliff: her brow,"
8953,CANTO IX,"Lucent with jewels, glitter’d, set in sign"
8954,CANTO IX,"Of that chill animal, who with his train"
8955,CANTO IX,"Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,"
8956,CANTO IX,"Two steps of her ascent the night had past,"
8957,CANTO IX,"And now the third was closing up its wing,"
8958,CANTO IX,"When I, who had so much of Adam with me,"
8959,CANTO IX,"Sank down upon the grass, o’ercome with sleep,"
8960,CANTO IX,"There where all five were seated. In that hour,"
8961,CANTO IX,"When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,"
8962,CANTO IX,"Rememb’ring haply ancient grief, renews,"
8963,CANTO IX,"And with our minds more wand’rers from the flesh,"
8964,CANTO IX,"And less by thought restrain’d are, as ’twere, full"
8965,CANTO IX,"Of holy divination in their dreams,"
8966,CANTO IX,Then in a vision did I seem to view
8967,CANTO IX,"A golden-feather’d eagle in the sky,"
8968,CANTO IX,"With open wings, and hov’ring for descent,"
8969,CANTO IX,"And I was in that place, methought, from whence"
8970,CANTO IX,"Young Ganymede, from his associates ’reft,"
8971,CANTO IX,Was snatch’d aloft to the high consistory.
8972,CANTO IX,"“Perhaps,” thought I within me, “here alone"
8973,CANTO IX,"He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains"
8974,CANTO IX,"To pounce upon the prey.” Therewith, it seem’d,"
8975,CANTO IX,A little wheeling in his airy tour
8976,CANTO IX,"Terrible as the lightning rush’d he down,"
8977,CANTO IX,And snatch’d me upward even to the fire.
8978,CANTO IX,"There both, I thought, the eagle and myself"
8979,CANTO IX,"Did burn; and so intense th’ imagin’d flames,"
8980,CANTO IX,That needs my sleep was broken off. As erst
8981,CANTO IX,"Achilles shook himself, and round him roll’d"
8982,CANTO IX,"His waken’d eyeballs wond’ring where he was,"
8983,CANTO IX,Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled
8984,CANTO IX,"To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;"
8985,CANTO IX,"E’en thus I shook me, soon as from my face"
8986,CANTO IX,"The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,"
8987,CANTO IX,Like one ice-struck with dread. Solo at my side
8988,CANTO IX,My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now
8989,CANTO IX,More than two hours aloft: and to the sea
8990,CANTO IX,"My looks were turn’d. “Fear not,” my master cried,"
8991,CANTO IX,“Assur’d we are at happy point. Thy strength
8992,CANTO IX,"Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come"
8993,CANTO IX,To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff
8994,CANTO IX,"That circling bounds it! Lo! the entrance there,"
8995,CANTO IX,Where it doth seem disparted! Ere the dawn
8996,CANTO IX,"Usher’d the daylight, when thy wearied soul"
8997,CANTO IX,"Slept in thee, o’er the flowery vale beneath"
8998,CANTO IX,"A lady came, and thus bespake me: “I"
8999,CANTO IX,"Am Lucia. Suffer me to take this man,"
9000,CANTO IX,Who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed.”
9001,CANTO IX,Sordello and the other gentle shapes
9002,CANTO IX,"Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,"
9003,CANTO IX,This summit reach’d: and I pursued her steps.
9004,CANTO IX,Here did she place thee. First her lovely eyes
9005,CANTO IX,That open entrance show’d me; then at once
9006,CANTO IX,"She vanish’d with thy sleep.” Like one, whose doubts"
9007,CANTO IX,"Are chas’d by certainty, and terror turn’d"
9008,CANTO IX,"To comfort on discovery of the truth,"
9009,CANTO IX,Such was the change in me: and as my guide
9010,CANTO IX,"Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff"
9011,CANTO IX,"He mov’d, and I behind him, towards the height."
9012,CANTO IX,
9013,CANTO IX,"Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,"
9014,CANTO IX,"Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully"
9015,CANTO IX,"I prop the structure! Nearer now we drew,"
9016,CANTO IX,"Arriv’d’ whence in that part, where first a breach"
9017,CANTO IX,"As of a wall appear’d, I could descry"
9018,CANTO IX,"A portal, and three steps beneath, that led"
9019,CANTO IX,"For inlet there, of different colour each,"
9020,CANTO IX,"And one who watch’d, but spake not yet a word."
9021,CANTO IX,"As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,"
9022,CANTO IX,"I mark’d him seated on the highest step,"
9023,CANTO IX,"In visage such, as past my power to bear."
9024,CANTO IX,"Grasp’d in his hand a naked sword, glanc’d back"
9025,CANTO IX,"The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain"
9026,CANTO IX,My sight directed. “Speak from whence ye stand:”
9027,CANTO IX,He cried: “What would ye? Where is your escort?
9028,CANTO IX,Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.”
9029,CANTO IX,
9030,CANTO IX,"“A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,”"
9031,CANTO IX,"Replied the’ instructor, “told us, even now,"
9032,CANTO IX,Pass that way: here the gate is.”—“And may she
9033,CANTO IX,"Befriending prosper your ascent,” resum’d"
9034,CANTO IX,The courteous keeper of the gate: “Come then
9035,CANTO IX,Before our steps.” We straightway thither came.
9036,CANTO IX,
9037,CANTO IX,The lowest stair was marble white so smooth
9038,CANTO IX,"And polish’d, that therein my mirror’d form"
9039,CANTO IX,Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark
9040,CANTO IX,"Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,"
9041,CANTO IX,"Crack’d lengthwise and across. The third, that lay"
9042,CANTO IX,"Massy above, seem’d porphyry, that flam’d"
9043,CANTO IX,Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.
9044,CANTO IX,"On this God’s angel either foot sustain’d,"
9045,CANTO IX,"Upon the threshold seated, which appear’d"
9046,CANTO IX,A rock of diamond. Up the trinal steps
9047,CANTO IX,"My leader cheerily drew me. “Ask,” said he,"
9048,CANTO IX,
9049,CANTO IX,"“With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.”"
9050,CANTO IX,
9051,CANTO IX,Piously at his holy feet devolv’d
9052,CANTO IX,"I cast me, praying him for pity’s sake"
9053,CANTO IX,That he would open to me: but first fell
9054,CANTO IX,Thrice on my bosom prostrate. Seven times0
9055,CANTO IX,"The letter, that denotes the inward stain,"
9056,CANTO IX,He on my forehead with the blunted point
9057,CANTO IX,"Of his drawn sword inscrib’d. And “Look,” he cried,"
9058,CANTO IX,"“When enter’d, that thou wash these scars away.”"
9059,CANTO IX,
9060,CANTO IX,"Ashes, or earth ta’en dry out of the ground,"
9061,CANTO IX,Were of one colour with the robe he wore.
9062,CANTO IX,From underneath that vestment forth he drew
9063,CANTO IX,"Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,"
9064,CANTO IX,"Its fellow silver. With the pallid first,"
9065,CANTO IX,"And next the burnish’d, he so ply’d the gate,"
9066,CANTO IX,As to content me well. “Whenever one
9067,CANTO IX,"Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight"
9068,CANTO IX,"It turn not, to this alley then expect"
9069,CANTO IX,Access in vain.” Such were the words he spake.
9070,CANTO IX,“One is more precious: but the other needs
9071,CANTO IX,"Skill and sagacity, large share of each,"
9072,CANTO IX,Ere its good task to disengage the knot
9073,CANTO IX,Be worthily perform’d. From Peter these
9074,CANTO IX,"I hold, of him instructed, that I err"
9075,CANTO IX,Rather in opening than in keeping fast;
9076,CANTO IX,So but the suppliant at my feet implore.”
9077,CANTO IX,
9078,CANTO IX,"Then of that hallow’d gate he thrust the door,"
9079,CANTO IX,"Exclaiming, “Enter, but this warning hear:"
9080,CANTO IX,He forth again departs who looks behind.”
9081,CANTO IX,
9082,CANTO IX,As in the hinges of that sacred ward
9083,CANTO IX,"The swivels turn’d, sonorous metal strong,"
9084,CANTO IX,Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily
9085,CANTO IX,"Roar’d the Tarpeian, when by force bereft"
9086,CANTO IX,"Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss"
9087,CANTO IX,"To leanness doom’d. Attentively I turn’d,"
9088,CANTO IX,"List’ning the thunder, that first issued forth;"
9089,CANTO IX,"And “We praise thee, O God,” methought I heard"
9090,CANTO IX,In accents blended with sweet melody.
9091,CANTO IX,"The strains came o’er mine ear, e’en as the sound"
9092,CANTO IX,"Of choral voices, that in solemn chant"
9093,CANTO IX,"With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,"
9094,CANTO IX,"Come swelling, now float indistinct away."
9095,CANTO IX,
9096,CANTO IX,
9097,CANTO IX,
9098,CANTO IX,
9099,CANTO X,CANTO X
9100,CANTO X,
9101,CANTO X,
9102,CANTO X,When we had passed the threshold of the gate
9103,CANTO X,"(Which the soul’s ill affection doth disuse,"
9104,CANTO X,"Making the crooked seem the straighter path),"
9105,CANTO X,"I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn’d,"
9106,CANTO X,For that offence what plea might have avail’d?
9107,CANTO X,
9108,CANTO X,"We mounted up the riven rock, that wound"
9109,CANTO X,"On either side alternate, as the wave"
9110,CANTO X,Flies and advances. “Here some little art
9111,CANTO X,"Behooves us,” said my leader, “that our steps"
9112,CANTO X,Observe the varying flexure of the path.”
9113,CANTO X,
9114,CANTO X,"Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb"
9115,CANTO X,"The moon once more o’erhangs her wat’ry couch,"
9116,CANTO X,Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free
9117,CANTO X,"We came and open, where the mount above"
9118,CANTO X,"One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,"
9119,CANTO X,"And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,"
9120,CANTO X,"Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads"
9121,CANTO X,That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink
9122,CANTO X,"Borders upon vacuity, to foot"
9123,CANTO X,"Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space"
9124,CANTO X,Had measur’d thrice the stature of a man:
9125,CANTO X,"And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,"
9126,CANTO X,"To leftward now and now to right dispatch’d,"
9127,CANTO X,That cornice equal in extent appear’d.
9128,CANTO X,
9129,CANTO X,"Not yet our feet had on that summit mov’d,"
9130,CANTO X,"When I discover’d that the bank around,"
9131,CANTO X,"Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,"
9132,CANTO X,"Was marble white, and so exactly wrought"
9133,CANTO X,"With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone"
9134,CANTO X,"Had Polycletus, but e’en nature’s self"
9135,CANTO X,Been sham’d. The angel who came down to earth
9136,CANTO X,With tidings of the peace so many years
9137,CANTO X,"Wept for in vain, that op’d the heavenly gates"
9138,CANTO X,"From their long interdict) before us seem’d,"
9139,CANTO X,"In a sweet act, so sculptur’d to the life,"
9140,CANTO X,He look’d no silent image. One had sworn
9141,CANTO X,"He had said, “Hail!” for she was imag’d there,"
9142,CANTO X,"By whom the key did open to God’s love,"
9143,CANTO X,And in her act as sensibly impress
9144,CANTO X,"That word, “Behold the handmaid of the Lord,”"
9145,CANTO X,As figure seal’d on wax. “Fix not thy mind
9146,CANTO X,"On one place only,” said the guide belov’d,"
9147,CANTO X,Who had me near him on that part where lies
9148,CANTO X,The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn’d
9149,CANTO X,"And mark’d, behind the virgin mother’s form,"
9150,CANTO X,"Upon that side, where he, that mov’d me, stood,"
9151,CANTO X,Another story graven on the rock.
9152,CANTO X,
9153,CANTO X,"I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,"
9154,CANTO X,That it might stand more aptly for my view.
9155,CANTO X,There in the self-same marble were engrav’d
9156,CANTO X,"The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,"
9157,CANTO X,That from unbidden office awes mankind.
9158,CANTO X,Before it came much people; and the whole
9159,CANTO X,"Parted in seven quires. One sense cried, “Nay,”"
9160,CANTO X,"Another, “Yes, they sing.” Like doubt arose"
9161,CANTO X,"Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl’d fume"
9162,CANTO X,Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.
9163,CANTO X,"Preceding the blest vessel, onward came"
9164,CANTO X,"With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,"
9165,CANTO X,Sweet Israel’s harper: in that hap he seem’d
9166,CANTO X,"Less and yet more than kingly. Opposite,"
9167,CANTO X,"At a great palace, from the lattice forth"
9168,CANTO X,"Look’d Michol, like a lady full of scorn"
9169,CANTO X,"And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,"
9170,CANTO X,"Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,"
9171,CANTO X,I mov’d me. There was storied on the rock
9172,CANTO X,"The’ exalted glory of the Roman prince,"
9173,CANTO X,Whose mighty worth mov’d Gregory to earn
9174,CANTO X,"His mighty conquest, Trajan th’ Emperor."
9175,CANTO X,"A widow at his bridle stood, attir’d"
9176,CANTO X,In tears and mourning. Round about them troop’d
9177,CANTO X,"Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold"
9178,CANTO X,"The eagles floated, struggling with the wind."
9179,CANTO X,The wretch appear’d amid all these to say:
9180,CANTO X,"“Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart"
9181,CANTO X,My son is murder’d.” He replying seem’d;
9182,CANTO X,
9183,CANTO X,"“Wait now till I return.” And she, as one"
9184,CANTO X,"Made hasty by her grief; “O sire, if thou"
9185,CANTO X,"Dost not return?”—“Where I am, who then is,"
9186,CANTO X,"May right thee.”—” What to thee is other’s good,"
9187,CANTO X,"If thou neglect thy own?”—“Now comfort thee,”"
9188,CANTO X,At length he answers. “It beseemeth well
9189,CANTO X,"My duty be perform’d, ere I move hence:"
9190,CANTO X,So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.”
9191,CANTO X,
9192,CANTO X,"He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc’d"
9193,CANTO X,"That visible speaking, new to us and strange"
9194,CANTO X,The like not found on earth. Fondly I gaz’d
9195,CANTO X,"Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,"
9196,CANTO X,"Shapes yet more precious for their artist’s sake,"
9197,CANTO X,"When “Lo,” the poet whisper’d, “where this way"
9198,CANTO X,"(But slack their pace), a multitude advance."
9199,CANTO X,These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.”
9200,CANTO X,
9201,CANTO X,"Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights"
9202,CANTO X,"Their lov’d allurement, were not slow to turn."
9203,CANTO X,
9204,CANTO X,Reader! I would not that amaz’d thou miss
9205,CANTO X,"Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God"
9206,CANTO X,Decrees our debts be cancel’d. Ponder not
9207,CANTO X,"The form of suff’ring. Think on what succeeds,"
9208,CANTO X,Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom
9209,CANTO X,"It cannot pass. “Instructor,” I began,"
9210,CANTO X,"“What I see hither tending, bears no trace"
9211,CANTO X,"Of human semblance, nor of aught beside"
9212,CANTO X,That my foil’d sight can guess.” He answering thus:
9213,CANTO X,"“So courb’d to earth, beneath their heavy teems"
9214,CANTO X,"Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first"
9215,CANTO X,"Struggled as thine. But look intently thither,"
9216,CANTO X,"An disentangle with thy lab’ring view,"
9217,CANTO X,"What underneath those stones approacheth: now,"
9218,CANTO X,"E’en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.”"
9219,CANTO X,
9220,CANTO X,Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones!
9221,CANTO X,"That feeble in the mind’s eye, lean your trust"
9222,CANTO X,Upon unstaid perverseness! Know ye not
9223,CANTO X,"That we are worms, yet made at last to form"
9224,CANTO X,"The winged insect, imp’d with angel plumes"
9225,CANTO X,That to heaven’s justice unobstructed soars?
9226,CANTO X,Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg’d souls?
9227,CANTO X,"Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,"
9228,CANTO X,Like the untimely embryon of a worm!
9229,CANTO X,
9230,CANTO X,"As, to support incumbent floor or roof,"
9231,CANTO X,"For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,"
9232,CANTO X,"That crumples up its knees unto its breast,"
9233,CANTO X,With the feign’d posture stirring ruth unfeign’d
9234,CANTO X,In the beholder’s fancy; so I saw
9235,CANTO X,"These fashion’d, when I noted well their guise."
9236,CANTO X,
9237,CANTO X,"Each, as his back was laden, came indeed"
9238,CANTO X,Or more or less contract; but it appear’d
9239,CANTO X,"As he, who show’d most patience in his look,"
9240,CANTO X,Wailing exclaim’d: “I can endure no more.”

9247,CANTO XI,
9248,CANTO XI,"O thou Almighty Father, who dost make"
9249,CANTO XI,"The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin’d,"
9250,CANTO XI,But that with love intenser there thou view’st
9251,CANTO XI,"Thy primal effluence, hallow’d be thy name:"
9252,CANTO XI,Join each created being to extol
9253,CANTO XI,"Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise"
9254,CANTO XI,Is thy blest Spirit. May thy kingdom’s peace
9255,CANTO XI,"Come unto us; for we, unless it come,"
9256,CANTO XI,With all our striving thither tend in vain.
9257,CANTO XI,As of their will the angels unto thee
9258,CANTO XI,"Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne"
9259,CANTO XI,"With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done"
9260,CANTO XI,By saintly men on earth. Grant us this day
9261,CANTO XI,"Our daily manna, without which he roams"
9262,CANTO XI,"Through this rough desert retrograde, who most"
9263,CANTO XI,Toils to advance his steps. As we to each
9264,CANTO XI,"Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou"
9265,CANTO XI,"Benign, and of our merit take no count."
9266,CANTO XI,’Gainst the old adversary prove thou not
9267,CANTO XI,Our virtue easily subdu’d; but free
9268,CANTO XI,From his incitements and defeat his wiles.
9269,CANTO XI,"This last petition, dearest Lord! is made"
9270,CANTO XI,"Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,"
9271,CANTO XI,But for their sakes who after us remain.”
9272,CANTO XI,
9273,CANTO XI,"Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,"
9274,CANTO XI,Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
9275,CANTO XI,"We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,"
9276,CANTO XI,"But with unequal anguish, wearied all,"
9277,CANTO XI,"Round the first circuit, purging as they go,"
9278,CANTO XI,The world’s gross darkness off: In our behalf
9279,CANTO XI,"If there vows still be offer’d, what can here"
9280,CANTO XI,"For them be vow’d and done by such, whose wills"
9281,CANTO XI,Have root of goodness in them? Well beseems
9282,CANTO XI,That we should help them wash away the stains
9283,CANTO XI,"They carried hence, that so made pure and light,"
9284,CANTO XI,They may spring upward to the starry spheres.
9285,CANTO XI,
9286,CANTO XI,“Ah! so may mercy-temper’d justice rid
9287,CANTO XI,"Your burdens speedily, that ye have power"
9288,CANTO XI,"To stretch your wing, which e’en to your desire"
9289,CANTO XI,"Shall lift you, as ye show us on which hand"
9290,CANTO XI,Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.
9291,CANTO XI,"And if there be more passages than one,"
9292,CANTO XI,Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;
9293,CANTO XI,"For this man who comes with me, and bears yet"
9294,CANTO XI,"The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,"
9295,CANTO XI,Despite his better will but slowly mounts.”
9296,CANTO XI,"From whom the answer came unto these words,"
9297,CANTO XI,"Which my guide spake, appear’d not; but ’twas said"
9298,CANTO XI,
9299,CANTO XI,"“Along the bank to rightward come with us,"
9300,CANTO XI,And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil
9301,CANTO XI,Of living man to climb: and were it not
9302,CANTO XI,"That I am hinder’d by the rock, wherewith"
9303,CANTO XI,"This arrogant neck is tam’d, whence needs I stoop"
9304,CANTO XI,"My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,"
9305,CANTO XI,Whose name thou speak’st not him I fain would view.
9306,CANTO XI,To mark if e’er I knew him? and to crave
9307,CANTO XI,His pity for the fardel that I bear.
9308,CANTO XI,"I was of Latiun, of a Tuscan horn"
9309,CANTO XI,A mighty one: Aldobranlesco’s name
9310,CANTO XI,"My sire’s, I know not if ye e’er have heard."
9311,CANTO XI,My old blood and forefathers’ gallant deeds
9312,CANTO XI,"Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot"
9313,CANTO XI,"The common mother, and to such excess,"
9314,CANTO XI,"Wax’d in my scorn of all men, that I fell,"
9315,CANTO XI,"Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna’s sons,"
9316,CANTO XI,"Each child in Campagnatico, can tell."
9317,CANTO XI,I am Omberto; not me only pride
9318,CANTO XI,"Hath injur’d, but my kindred all involv’d"
9319,CANTO XI,In mischief with her. Here my lot ordains
9320,CANTO XI,"Under this weight to groan, till I appease"
9321,CANTO XI,"God’s angry justice, since I did it not"
9322,CANTO XI,"Amongst the living, here amongst the dead.”"
9323,CANTO XI,
9324,CANTO XI,List’ning I bent my visage down: and one
9325,CANTO XI,(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight
9326,CANTO XI,"That urg’d him, saw me, knew me straight, and call’d,"
9327,CANTO XI,Holding his eyes With difficulty fix’d
9328,CANTO XI,"Intent upon me, stooping as I went"
9329,CANTO XI,"Companion of their way. “O!” I exclaim’d,"
9330,CANTO XI,
9331,CANTO XI,"“Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou"
9332,CANTO XI,"Agobbio’s glory, glory of that art"
9333,CANTO XI,Which they of Paris call the limmer’s skill?”
9334,CANTO XI,
9335,CANTO XI,"“Brother!” said he, “with tints that gayer smile,"
9336,CANTO XI,Bolognian Franco’s pencil lines the leaves.
9337,CANTO XI,His all the honour now; mine borrow’d light.
9338,CANTO XI,"In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,"
9339,CANTO XI,"The whilst I liv’d, through eagerness of zeal"
9340,CANTO XI,For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.
9341,CANTO XI,Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.
9342,CANTO XI,"Nor were I even here; if, able still"
9343,CANTO XI,"To sin, I had not turn’d me unto God."
9344,CANTO XI,"O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp’d"
9345,CANTO XI,"E’en in its height of verdure, if an age"
9346,CANTO XI,Less bright succeed not! Cimabue thought
9347,CANTO XI,To lord it over painting’s field; and now
9348,CANTO XI,"The cry is Giotto’s, and his name eclips’d."
9349,CANTO XI,Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch’d
9350,CANTO XI,"The letter’d prize: and he perhaps is born,"
9351,CANTO XI,Who shall drive either from their nest. The noise
9352,CANTO XI,"Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,"
9353,CANTO XI,"That blows from divers points, and shifts its name"
9354,CANTO XI,Shifting the point it blows from. Shalt thou more
9355,CANTO XI,"Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh"
9356,CANTO XI,"Part shrivel’d from thee, than if thou hadst died,"
9357,CANTO XI,"Before the coral and the pap were left,"
9358,CANTO XI,Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that
9359,CANTO XI,"Is, to eternity compar’d, a space,"
9360,CANTO XI,Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye
9361,CANTO XI,To the heaven’s slowest orb. He there who treads
9362,CANTO XI,"So leisurely before me, far and wide"
9363,CANTO XI,Through Tuscany resounded once; and now
9364,CANTO XI,Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam’d:
9365,CANTO XI,"There was he sov’reign, when destruction caught"
9366,CANTO XI,"The madd’ning rage of Florence, in that day"
9367,CANTO XI,Proud as she now is loathsome. Your renown
9368,CANTO XI,"Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,"
9369,CANTO XI,"And his might withers it, by whom it sprang"
9370,CANTO XI,Crude from the lap of earth.” I thus to him:
9371,CANTO XI,“True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe
9372,CANTO XI,"The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay"
9373,CANTO XI,What tumours rankle there. But who is he
9374,CANTO XI,"Of whom thou spak’st but now?”—“This,” he replied,"
9375,CANTO XI,"“Is Provenzano. He is here, because"
9376,CANTO XI,"He reach’d, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway"
9377,CANTO XI,"Of all Sienna. Thus he still hath gone,"
9378,CANTO XI,"Thus goeth never-resting, since he died."
9379,CANTO XI,"Such is th’ acquittance render’d back of him,"
9380,CANTO XI,"Who, beyond measure, dar’d on earth.” I then:"
9381,CANTO XI,“If soul that to the verge of life delays
9382,CANTO XI,"Repentance, linger in that lower space,"
9383,CANTO XI,"Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,"
9384,CANTO XI,How chanc’d admittance was vouchsaf’d to him?”
9385,CANTO XI,
9386,CANTO XI,"“When at his glory’s topmost height,” said he,"
9387,CANTO XI,"“Respect of dignity all cast aside,"
9388,CANTO XI,"Freely He fix’d him on Sienna’s plain,"
9389,CANTO XI,"A suitor to redeem his suff’ring friend,"
9390,CANTO XI,"Who languish’d in the prison-house of Charles,"
9391,CANTO XI,Nor for his sake refus’d through every vein
9392,CANTO XI,"To tremble. More I will not say; and dark,"
9393,CANTO XI,"I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon"
9394,CANTO XI,Shall help thee to a comment on the text.
9395,CANTO XI,"This is the work, that from these limits freed him.”"
9396,CANTO XI,
9397,CANTO XI,
9398,CANTO XI,
9399,CANTO XI,
9400,CANTO XII,CANTO XII
9401,CANTO XII,
9402,CANTO XII,
9403,CANTO XII,"With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,"
9404,CANTO XII,I with that laden spirit journey’d on
9405,CANTO XII,Long as the mild instructor suffer’d me;
9406,CANTO XII,"But when he bade me quit him, and proceed"
9407,CANTO XII,"(For “here,” said he, “behooves with sail and oars"
9408,CANTO XII,"Each man, as best he may, push on his bark”),"
9409,CANTO XII,"Upright, as one dispos’d for speed, I rais’d"
9410,CANTO XII,"My body, still in thought submissive bow’d."
9411,CANTO XII,
9412,CANTO XII,I now my leader’s track not loth pursued;
9413,CANTO XII,And each had shown how light we far’d along
9414,CANTO XII,When thus he warn’d me: “Bend thine eyesight down:
9415,CANTO XII,For thou to ease the way shall find it good
9416,CANTO XII,To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.”
9417,CANTO XII,
9418,CANTO XII,"As in memorial of the buried, drawn"
9419,CANTO XII,"Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur’d form"
9420,CANTO XII,"Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof"
9421,CANTO XII,"Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak’d,"
9422,CANTO XII,"Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),"
9423,CANTO XII,"So saw I there, but with more curious skill"
9424,CANTO XII,"Of portraiture o’erwrought, whate’er of space"
9425,CANTO XII,From forth the mountain stretches. On one part
9426,CANTO XII,"Him I beheld, above all creatures erst"
9427,CANTO XII,"Created noblest, light’ning fall from heaven:"
9428,CANTO XII,On th’ other side with bolt celestial pierc’d
9429,CANTO XII,Briareus: cumb’ring earth he lay through dint
9430,CANTO XII,Of mortal ice-stroke. The Thymbraean god
9431,CANTO XII,"With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,"
9432,CANTO XII,"Arm’d still, and gazing on the giant’s limbs"
9433,CANTO XII,Strewn o’er th’ ethereal field. Nimrod I saw:
9434,CANTO XII,"At foot of the stupendous work he stood,"
9435,CANTO XII,"As if bewilder’d, looking on the crowd"
9436,CANTO XII,Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar’s plain.
9437,CANTO XII,
9438,CANTO XII,O Niobe! in what a trance of woe
9439,CANTO XII,"Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,"
9440,CANTO XII,Sev’n sons on either side thee slain! O Saul!
9441,CANTO XII,How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword
9442,CANTO XII,"Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour"
9443,CANTO XII,Ne’er visited with rain from heav’n or dew!
9444,CANTO XII,
9445,CANTO XII,O fond Arachne! thee I also saw
9446,CANTO XII,Half spider now in anguish crawling up
9447,CANTO XII,Th’ unfinish’d web thou weaved’st to thy bane!
9448,CANTO XII,
9449,CANTO XII,O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem
9450,CANTO XII,Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote
9451,CANTO XII,With none to chase him in his chariot whirl’d.
9452,CANTO XII,
9453,CANTO XII,Was shown beside upon the solid floor
9454,CANTO XII,How dear Alcmaeon forc’d his mother rate
9455,CANTO XII,That ornament in evil hour receiv’d:
9456,CANTO XII,How in the temple on Sennacherib fell
9457,CANTO XII,"His sons, and how a corpse they left him there."
9458,CANTO XII,Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made
9459,CANTO XII,"By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:"
9460,CANTO XII,"“Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!”"
9461,CANTO XII,Was shown how routed in the battle fled
9462,CANTO XII,"Th’ Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e’en"
9463,CANTO XII,The relics of the carnage. Troy I mark’d
9464,CANTO XII,"In ashes and in caverns. Oh! how fall’n,"
9465,CANTO XII,"How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!"
9466,CANTO XII,
9467,CANTO XII,What master of the pencil or the style
9468,CANTO XII,"Had trac’d the shades and lines, that might have made"
9469,CANTO XII,"The subtlest workman wonder? Dead the dead,"
9470,CANTO XII,The living seem’d alive; with clearer view
9471,CANTO XII,"His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,"
9472,CANTO XII,"Than mine what I did tread on, while I went"
9473,CANTO XII,Low bending. Now swell out; and with stiff necks
9474,CANTO XII,"Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,"
9475,CANTO XII,Lest they descry the evil of your path!
9476,CANTO XII,
9477,CANTO XII,I noted not (so busied was my thought)
9478,CANTO XII,"How much we now had circled of the mount,"
9479,CANTO XII,"And of his course yet more the sun had spent,"
9480,CANTO XII,"When he, who with still wakeful caution went,"
9481,CANTO XII,Admonish’d: “Raise thou up thy head: for know
9482,CANTO XII,Time is not now for slow suspense. Behold
9483,CANTO XII,That way an angel hasting towards us! Lo
9484,CANTO XII,Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return
9485,CANTO XII,From service on the day. Wear thou in look
9486,CANTO XII,"And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,"
9487,CANTO XII,That gladly he may forward us aloft.
9488,CANTO XII,Consider that this day ne’er dawns again.”
9489,CANTO XII,
9490,CANTO XII,"Time’s loss he had so often warn’d me ’gainst,"
9491,CANTO XII,I could not miss the scope at which he aim’d.
9492,CANTO XII,
9493,CANTO XII,"The goodly shape approach’d us, snowy white"
9494,CANTO XII,"In vesture, and with visage casting streams"
9495,CANTO XII,Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.
9496,CANTO XII,"His arms he open’d, then his wings; and spake:"
9497,CANTO XII,"“Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now"
9498,CANTO XII,Th’ ascent is without difficulty gain’d.”
9499,CANTO XII,
9500,CANTO XII,"A scanty few are they, who when they hear"
9501,CANTO XII,"Such tidings, hasten. O ye race of men"
9502,CANTO XII,"Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind"
9503,CANTO XII,So slight to baffle ye? He led us on
9504,CANTO XII,Where the rock parted; here against my front
9505,CANTO XII,"Did beat his wings, then promis’d I should fare"
9506,CANTO XII,In safety on my way. As to ascend
9507,CANTO XII,"That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands"
9508,CANTO XII,"(O’er Rubaconte, looking lordly down"
9509,CANTO XII,"On the well-guided city,) up the right"
9510,CANTO XII,Th’ impetuous rise is broken by the steps
9511,CANTO XII,"Carv’d in that old and simple age, when still"
9512,CANTO XII,The registry and label rested safe;
9513,CANTO XII,"Thus is th’ acclivity reliev’d, which here"
9514,CANTO XII,Precipitous from the other circuit falls:
9515,CANTO XII,But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.
9516,CANTO XII,
9517,CANTO XII,"As ent’ring there we turn’d, voices, in strain"
9518,CANTO XII,"Ineffable, sang: “Blessed are the poor"
9519,CANTO XII,In spirit.” Ah how far unlike to these
9520,CANTO XII,"The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,"
9521,CANTO XII,There shrieks of woe! We climb the holy stairs:
9522,CANTO XII,And lighter to myself by far I seem’d
9523,CANTO XII,"Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:"
9524,CANTO XII,"“Say, master, of what heavy thing have I"
9525,CANTO XII,"Been lighten’d, that scarce aught the sense of toil"
9526,CANTO XII,Affects me journeying?” He in few replied:
9527,CANTO XII,"“When sin’s broad characters, that yet remain"
9528,CANTO XII,"Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac’d,"
9529,CANTO XII,"Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,"
9530,CANTO XII,Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will
9531,CANTO XII,"Be so o’ercome, they not alone shall feel"
9532,CANTO XII,"No sense of labour, but delight much more"
9533,CANTO XII,Shall wait them urg’d along their upward way.”
9534,CANTO XII,
9535,CANTO XII,"Then like to one, upon whose head is plac’d"
9536,CANTO XII,Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks
9537,CANTO XII,Of others as they pass him by; his hand
9538,CANTO XII,"Lends therefore help to’ assure him, searches, finds,"
9539,CANTO XII,And well performs such office as the eye
9540,CANTO XII,Wants power to execute: so stretching forth
9541,CANTO XII,"The fingers of my right hand, did I find"
9542,CANTO XII,"Six only of the letters, which his sword"
9543,CANTO XII,Who bare the keys had trac’d upon my brow.
9544,CANTO XII,"The leader, as he mark’d mine action, smil’d."
9545,CANTO XII,
9546,CANTO XII,
9547,CANTO XII,
9548,CANTO XII,
9549,CANTO XIII,CANTO XIII
9550,CANTO XIII,
9551,CANTO XIII,
9552,CANTO XIII,"We reach’d the summit of the scale, and stood"
9553,CANTO XIII,Upon the second buttress of that mount
9554,CANTO XIII,"Which healeth him who climbs. A cornice there,"
9555,CANTO XIII,"Like to the former, girdles round the hill;"
9556,CANTO XIII,Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.
9557,CANTO XIII,
9558,CANTO XIII,Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth
9559,CANTO XIII,"The rampart and the path, reflecting nought"
9560,CANTO XIII,But the rock’s sullen hue. “If here we wait
9561,CANTO XIII,"For some to question,” said the bard, “I fear"
9562,CANTO XIII,Our choice may haply meet too long delay.”
9563,CANTO XIII,
9564,CANTO XIII,Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes
9565,CANTO XIII,"He fastn’d, made his right the central point"
9566,CANTO XIII,"From whence to move, and turn’d the left aside."
9567,CANTO XIII,"“O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,"
9568,CANTO XIII,"Conduct us thou,” he cried, “on this new way,"
9569,CANTO XIII,"Where now I venture, leading to the bourn"
9570,CANTO XIII,We seek. The universal world to thee
9571,CANTO XIII,Owes warmth and lustre. If no other cause
9572,CANTO XIII,"Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.”"
9573,CANTO XIII,
9574,CANTO XIII,"Far, as is measur’d for a mile on earth,"
9575,CANTO XIII,In brief space had we journey’d; such prompt will
9576,CANTO XIII,"Impell’d; and towards us flying, now were heard"
9577,CANTO XIII,"Spirits invisible, who courteously"
9578,CANTO XIII,Unto love’s table bade the welcome guest.
9579,CANTO XIII,"The voice, that first? flew by, call’d forth aloud,"
9580,CANTO XIII,"“They have no wine; “ so on behind us past,"
9581,CANTO XIII,"Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost"
9582,CANTO XIII,"In the faint distance, when another came"
9583,CANTO XIII,"Crying, “I am Orestes,” and alike"
9584,CANTO XIII,"Wing’d its fleet way. “Oh father!” I exclaim’d,"
9585,CANTO XIII,"“What tongues are these?” and as I question’d, lo!"
9586,CANTO XIII,"A third exclaiming, “Love ye those have wrong’d you.”"
9587,CANTO XIII,
9588,CANTO XIII,"“This circuit,” said my teacher, “knots the scourge"
9589,CANTO XIII,"For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn"
9590,CANTO XIII,By charity’s correcting hand. The curb
9591,CANTO XIII,"Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear"
9592,CANTO XIII,"(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,"
9593,CANTO XIII,Where pardon sets them free. But fix thine eyes
9594,CANTO XIII,"Intently through the air, and thou shalt see"
9595,CANTO XIII,"A multitude before thee seated, each"
9596,CANTO XIII,Along the shelving grot.” Then more than erst
9597,CANTO XIII,"I op’d my eyes, before me view’d, and saw"
9598,CANTO XIII,Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;
9599,CANTO XIII,"And when we pass’d a little forth, I heard"
9600,CANTO XIII,"A crying, “Blessed Mary! pray for us,"
9601,CANTO XIII,Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!”
9602,CANTO XIII,
9603,CANTO XIII,I do not think there walks on earth this day
9604,CANTO XIII,"Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn’d"
9605,CANTO XIII,With pity at the sight that next I saw.
9606,CANTO XIII,"Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now"
9607,CANTO XIII,"I stood so near them, that their semblances"
9608,CANTO XIII,Came clearly to my view. Of sackcloth vile
9609,CANTO XIII,Their cov’ring seem’d; and on his shoulder one
9610,CANTO XIII,"Did stay another, leaning, and all lean’d"
9611,CANTO XIII,"Against the cliff. E’en thus the blind and poor,"
9612,CANTO XIII,"Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,"
9613,CANTO XIII,"Stand, each his head upon his fellow’s sunk,"
9614,CANTO XIII,"So most to stir compassion, not by sound"
9615,CANTO XIII,"Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,"
9616,CANTO XIII,The sight of mis’ry. And as never beam
9617,CANTO XIII,"Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,"
9618,CANTO XIII,E’en so was heav’n a niggard unto these
9619,CANTO XIII,"Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,"
9620,CANTO XIII,"A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,"
9621,CANTO XIII,As for the taming of a haggard hawk.
9622,CANTO XIII,
9623,CANTO XIII,"It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look"
9624,CANTO XIII,"On others, yet myself the while unseen."
9625,CANTO XIII,To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.
9626,CANTO XIII,"He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,"
9627,CANTO XIII,"Nor waited for my questioning, but said:"
9628,CANTO XIII,"“Speak; and be brief, be subtle in thy words.”"
9629,CANTO XIII,
9630,CANTO XIII,"On that part of the cornice, whence no rim"
9631,CANTO XIII,"Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;"
9632,CANTO XIII,"On the’ other side me were the spirits, their cheeks"
9633,CANTO XIII,"Bathing devout with penitential tears,"
9634,CANTO XIII,That through the dread impalement forc’d a way.
9635,CANTO XIII,
9636,CANTO XIII,"I turn’d me to them, and “O shades!” said I,"
9637,CANTO XIII,
9638,CANTO XIII,“Assur’d that to your eyes unveil’d shall shine
9639,CANTO XIII,"The lofty light, sole object of your wish,"
9640,CANTO XIII,So may heaven’s grace clear whatsoe’er of foam
9641,CANTO XIII,"Floats turbid on the conscience, that thenceforth"
9642,CANTO XIII,"The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,"
9643,CANTO XIII,As ye declare (for so shall ye impart
9644,CANTO XIII,A boon I dearly prize) if any soul
9645,CANTO XIII,Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance
9646,CANTO XIII,"That soul may profit, if I learn so much.”"
9647,CANTO XIII,
9648,CANTO XIII,"“My brother, we are each one citizens"
9649,CANTO XIII,"Of one true city. Any thou wouldst say,"
9650,CANTO XIII,Who lived a stranger in Italia’s land.”
9651,CANTO XIII,
9652,CANTO XIII,"So heard I answering, as appeal’d, a voice"
9653,CANTO XIII,That onward came some space from whence I stood.
9654,CANTO XIII,
9655,CANTO XIII,"A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark’d"
9656,CANTO XIII,Expectance. Ask ye how? The chin was rais’d
9657,CANTO XIII,"As in one reft of sight. “Spirit,” said I,"
9658,CANTO XIII,“Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be
9659,CANTO XIII,"That which didst answer to me,) or by place"
9660,CANTO XIII,"Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.”"
9661,CANTO XIII,
9662,CANTO XIII,"“I was,” it answer’d, “of Sienna: here"
9663,CANTO XIII,"I cleanse away with these the evil life,"
9664,CANTO XIII,"Soliciting with tears that He, who is,"
9665,CANTO XIII,Vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam’d
9666,CANTO XIII,"In sapience I excell’d not, gladder far"
9667,CANTO XIII,"Of others’ hurt, than of the good befell me."
9668,CANTO XIII,"That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,"
9669,CANTO XIII,"Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it."
9670,CANTO XIII,"When now my years slop’d waning down the arch,"
9671,CANTO XIII,"It so bechanc’d, my fellow citizens"
9672,CANTO XIII,"Near Colle met their enemies in the field,"
9673,CANTO XIII,And I pray’d God to grant what He had will’d.
9674,CANTO XIII,"There were they vanquish’d, and betook themselves"
9675,CANTO XIII,Unto the bitter passages of flight.
9676,CANTO XIII,"I mark’d the hunt, and waxing out of bounds"
9677,CANTO XIII,"In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,"
9678,CANTO XIII,"And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,"
9679,CANTO XIII,"Cried, “It is over. Heav’n! I fear thee not.”"
9680,CANTO XIII,Upon my verge of life I wish’d for peace
9681,CANTO XIII,With God; nor repentance had supplied
9682,CANTO XIII,"What I did lack of duty, were it not"
9683,CANTO XIII,"The hermit Piero, touch’d with charity,"
9684,CANTO XIII,In his devout orisons thought on me.
9685,CANTO XIII,"But who art thou that question’st of our state,"
9686,CANTO XIII,"Who go’st to my belief, with lids unclos’d,"
9687,CANTO XIII,"And breathest in thy talk?”—“Mine eyes,” said I,"
9688,CANTO XIII,“May yet be here ta’en from me; but not long;
9689,CANTO XIII,For they have not offended grievously
9690,CANTO XIII,With envious glances. But the woe beneath
9691,CANTO XIII,Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.
9692,CANTO XIII,That nether load already weighs me down.”
9693,CANTO XIII,
9694,CANTO XIII,She thus: “Who then amongst us here aloft
9695,CANTO XIII,"Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?”"
9696,CANTO XIII,
9697,CANTO XIII,"“He,” answer’d I, “who standeth mute beside me."
9698,CANTO XIII,"I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,"
9699,CANTO XIII,If thou desire I yonder yet should move
9700,CANTO XIII,"For thee my mortal feet.”—“Oh!” she replied,"
9701,CANTO XIII,"“This is so strange a thing, it is great sign"
9702,CANTO XIII,That God doth love thee. Therefore with thy prayer
9703,CANTO XIII,"Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,"
9704,CANTO XIII,"Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet"
9705,CANTO XIII,"E’er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame"
9706,CANTO XIII,Amongst my kindred. Them shalt thou behold
9707,CANTO XIII,"With that vain multitude, who set their hope"
9708,CANTO XIII,"On Telamone’s haven, there to fail"
9709,CANTO XIII,"Confounded, more shall when the fancied stream"
9710,CANTO XIII,They sought of Dian call’d: but they who lead
9711,CANTO XIII,"Their navies, more than ruin’d hopes shall mourn.”"
9712,CANTO XIII,
9713,CANTO XIII,
9714,CANTO XIII,
9715,CANTO XIII,
9716,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
9717,CANTO XIV,
9718,CANTO XIV,
9719,CANTO XIV,"“Say who is he around our mountain winds,"
9720,CANTO XIV,"Or ever death has prun’d his wing for flight,"
9721,CANTO XIV,That opes his eyes and covers them at will?”
9722,CANTO XIV,
9723,CANTO XIV,"“I know not who he is, but know thus much"
9724,CANTO XIV,"He comes not singly. Do thou ask of him,"
9725,CANTO XIV,"For thou art nearer to him, and take heed"
9726,CANTO XIV,"Accost him gently, so that he may speak.”"
9727,CANTO XIV,
9728,CANTO XIV,Thus on the right two Spirits bending each
9729,CANTO XIV,"Toward the other, talk’d of me, then both"
9730,CANTO XIV,"Addressing me, their faces backward lean’d,"
9731,CANTO XIV,"And thus the one began: “O soul, who yet"
9732,CANTO XIV,"Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky!"
9733,CANTO XIV,"For charity, we pray thee’ comfort us,"
9734,CANTO XIV,"Recounting whence thou com’st, and who thou art:"
9735,CANTO XIV,For thou dost make us at the favour shown thee
9736,CANTO XIV,"Marvel, as at a thing that ne’er hath been.”"
9737,CANTO XIV,
9738,CANTO XIV,"“There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,"
9739,CANTO XIV,"I straight began: “a brooklet, whose well-head"
9740,CANTO XIV,"Springs up in Falterona, with his race"
9741,CANTO XIV,"Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles"
9742,CANTO XIV,"Hath measur’d. From his banks bring, I this frame."
9743,CANTO XIV,To tell you who I am were words misspent:
9744,CANTO XIV,For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour’s lip.”
9745,CANTO XIV,
9746,CANTO XIV,“If well I do incorp’rate with my thought
9747,CANTO XIV,"The meaning of thy speech,” said he, who first"
9748,CANTO XIV,"Addrest me, “thou dost speak of Arno’s wave.”"
9749,CANTO XIV,
9750,CANTO XIV,To whom the other: “Why hath he conceal’d
9751,CANTO XIV,"The title of that river, as a man"
9752,CANTO XIV,"Doth of some horrible thing?” The spirit, who"
9753,CANTO XIV,"Thereof was question’d, did acquit him thus:"
9754,CANTO XIV,“I know not: but ’tis fitting well the name
9755,CANTO XIV,Should perish of that vale; for from the source
9756,CANTO XIV,Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep
9757,CANTO XIV,"Maim’d of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass"
9758,CANTO XIV,"Beyond that limit,) even to the point"
9759,CANTO XIV,"Whereunto ocean is restor’d, what heaven"
9760,CANTO XIV,"Drains from th’ exhaustless store for all earth’s streams,"
9761,CANTO XIV,"Throughout the space is virtue worried down,"
9762,CANTO XIV,"As ’twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,"
9763,CANTO XIV,"Or through disastrous influence on the place,"
9764,CANTO XIV,"Or else distortion of misguided wills,"
9765,CANTO XIV,"That custom goads to evil: whence in those,"
9766,CANTO XIV,"The dwellers in that miserable vale,"
9767,CANTO XIV,"Nature is so transform’d, it seems as they"
9768,CANTO XIV,"Had shar’d of Circe’s feeding. ’Midst brute swine,"
9769,CANTO XIV,Worthier of acorns than of other food
9770,CANTO XIV,"Created for man’s use, he shapeth first"
9771,CANTO XIV,"His obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds"
9772,CANTO XIV,"Curs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom"
9773,CANTO XIV,"He turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,"
9774,CANTO XIV,By how much more the curst and luckless foss
9775,CANTO XIV,"Swells out to largeness, e’en so much it finds"
9776,CANTO XIV,Dogs turning into wolves. Descending still
9777,CANTO XIV,"Through yet more hollow eddies, next he meets"
9778,CANTO XIV,"A race of foxes, so replete with craft,"
9779,CANTO XIV,They do not fear that skill can master it.
9780,CANTO XIV,Nor will I cease because my words are heard
9781,CANTO XIV,By other ears than thine. It shall be well
9782,CANTO XIV,"For this man, if he keep in memory"
9783,CANTO XIV,What from no erring Spirit I reveal.
9784,CANTO XIV,"Lo! I behold thy grandson, that becomes"
9785,CANTO XIV,"A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore"
9786,CANTO XIV,"Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:"
9787,CANTO XIV,"Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale,"
9788,CANTO XIV,Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.
9789,CANTO XIV,"Many of life he reaves, himself of worth"
9790,CANTO XIV,And goodly estimation. Smear’d with gore
9791,CANTO XIV,"Mark how he issues from the rueful wood,"
9792,CANTO XIV,"Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years"
9793,CANTO XIV,It spreads not to prime lustihood again.”
9794,CANTO XIV,
9795,CANTO XIV,"As one, who tidings hears of woe to come,"
9796,CANTO XIV,"Changes his looks perturb’d, from whate’er part"
9797,CANTO XIV,"The peril grasp him, so beheld I change"
9798,CANTO XIV,"That spirit, who had turn’d to listen, struck"
9799,CANTO XIV,"With sadness, soon as he had caught the word."
9800,CANTO XIV,
9801,CANTO XIV,His visage and the other’s speech did raise
9802,CANTO XIV,"Desire in me to know the names of both,"
9803,CANTO XIV,whereof with meek entreaty I inquir’d.
9804,CANTO XIV,
9805,CANTO XIV,"The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum’d:"
9806,CANTO XIV,“Thy wish imports that I vouchsafe to do
9807,CANTO XIV,For thy sake what thou wilt not do for mine.
9808,CANTO XIV,But since God’s will is that so largely shine
9809,CANTO XIV,"His grace in thee, I will be liberal too."
9810,CANTO XIV,Guido of Duca know then that I am.
9811,CANTO XIV,"Envy so parch’d my blood, that had I seen"
9812,CANTO XIV,"A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark’d"
9813,CANTO XIV,A livid paleness overspread my cheek.
9814,CANTO XIV,Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow’d.
9815,CANTO XIV,"O man, why place thy heart where there doth need"
9816,CANTO XIV,Exclusion of participants in good?
9817,CANTO XIV,"This is Rinieri’s spirit, this the boast"
9818,CANTO XIV,"And honour of the house of Calboli,"
9819,CANTO XIV,Where of his worth no heritage remains.
9820,CANTO XIV,"Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript"
9821,CANTO XIV,"(’twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)"
9822,CANTO XIV,Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;
9823,CANTO XIV,But in those limits such a growth has sprung
9824,CANTO XIV,"Of rank and venom’d roots, as long would mock"
9825,CANTO XIV,Slow culture’s toil. Where is good Lizio? where
9826,CANTO XIV,"Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?"
9827,CANTO XIV,O bastard slips of old Romagna’s line!
9828,CANTO XIV,"When in Bologna the low artisan,"
9829,CANTO XIV,"And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,"
9830,CANTO XIV,A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.
9831,CANTO XIV,"Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,"
9832,CANTO XIV,"When I recall to mind those once lov’d names,"
9833,CANTO XIV,"Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him"
9834,CANTO XIV,"That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,"
9835,CANTO XIV,"With Traversaro’s house and Anastagio s,"
9836,CANTO XIV,"(Each race disherited) and beside these,"
9837,CANTO XIV,"The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,"
9838,CANTO XIV,That witch’d us into love and courtesy;
9839,CANTO XIV,Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.
9840,CANTO XIV,"O Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still,"
9841,CANTO XIV,"Since forth of thee thy family hath gone,"
9842,CANTO XIV,"And many, hating evil, join’d their steps?"
9843,CANTO XIV,"Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,"
9844,CANTO XIV,"Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,"
9845,CANTO XIV,"And Conio worse, who care to propagate"
9846,CANTO XIV,A race of Counties from such blood as theirs.
9847,CANTO XIV,"Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then"
9848,CANTO XIV,When from amongst you tries your demon child.
9849,CANTO XIV,"Not so, howe’er, that henceforth there remain"
9850,CANTO XIV,True proof of what ye were. O Hugolin!
9851,CANTO XIV,Thou sprung of Fantolini’s line! thy name
9852,CANTO XIV,"Is safe, since none is look’d for after thee"
9853,CANTO XIV,"To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock."
9854,CANTO XIV,"But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take"
9855,CANTO XIV,Far more delight in weeping than in words.
9856,CANTO XIV,Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.”
9857,CANTO XIV,
9858,CANTO XIV,We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard
9859,CANTO XIV,Our steps. Their silence therefore of our way
9860,CANTO XIV,"Assur’d us. Soon as we had quitted them,"
9861,CANTO XIV,"Advancing onward, lo! a voice that seem’d"
9862,CANTO XIV,"Like vollied light’ning, when it rives the air,"
9863,CANTO XIV,"Met us, and shouted, “Whosoever finds"
9864,CANTO XIV,"Will slay me,” then fled from us, as the bolt"
9865,CANTO XIV,Lanc’d sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.
9866,CANTO XIV,"When it had giv’n short truce unto our hearing,"
9867,CANTO XIV,Behold the other with a crash as loud
9868,CANTO XIV,As the quick-following thunder: “Mark in me
9869,CANTO XIV,Aglauros turn’d to rock.” I at the sound
9870,CANTO XIV,Retreating drew more closely to my guide.
9871,CANTO XIV,
9872,CANTO XIV,Now in mute stillness rested all the air:
9873,CANTO XIV,And thus he spake: “There was the galling bit.
9874,CANTO XIV,"But your old enemy so baits his hook,"
9875,CANTO XIV,He drags you eager to him. Hence nor curb
9876,CANTO XIV,"Avails you, nor reclaiming call. Heav’n calls"
9877,CANTO XIV,And round about you wheeling courts your gaze
9878,CANTO XIV,With everlasting beauties. Yet your eye
9879,CANTO XIV,Turns with fond doting still upon the earth.
9880,CANTO XIV,Therefore He smites you who discerneth all.”
9881,CANTO XIV,
9882,CANTO XIV,
9883,CANTO XIV,
9884,CANTO XIV,
9885,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
9886,CANTO XV,
9887,CANTO XV,
9888,CANTO XV,"As much as ’twixt the third hour’s close and dawn,"
9889,CANTO XV,"Appeareth of heav’n’s sphere, that ever whirls"
9890,CANTO XV,"As restless as an infant in his play,"
9891,CANTO XV,So much appear’d remaining to the sun
9892,CANTO XV,Of his slope journey towards the western goal.
9893,CANTO XV,
9894,CANTO XV,"Evening was there, and here the noon of night;"
9895,CANTO XV,and full upon our forehead smote the beams.
9896,CANTO XV,"For round the mountain, circling, so our path"
9897,CANTO XV,"Had led us, that toward the sun-set now"
9898,CANTO XV,Direct we journey’d: when I felt a weight
9899,CANTO XV,"Of more exceeding splendour, than before,"
9900,CANTO XV,"Press on my front. The cause unknown, amaze"
9901,CANTO XV,"Possess’d me, and both hands against my brow"
9902,CANTO XV,"Lifting, I interpos’d them, as a screen,"
9903,CANTO XV,That of its gorgeous superflux of light
9904,CANTO XV,"Clipp’d the diminish’d orb. As when the ray,"
9905,CANTO XV,Striking On water or the surface clear
9906,CANTO XV,"Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,"
9907,CANTO XV,"Ascending at a glance, e’en as it fell,"
9908,CANTO XV,"(And so much differs from the stone, that falls"
9909,CANTO XV,"Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown;"
9910,CANTO XV,Thus with refracted light before me seemed
9911,CANTO XV,The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste
9912,CANTO XV,"My sight recoil’d. “What is this, sire belov’d!"
9913,CANTO XV,’Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?”
9914,CANTO XV,"Cried I, “and which towards us moving seems?”"
9915,CANTO XV,
9916,CANTO XV,"“Marvel not, if the family of heav’n,”"
9917,CANTO XV,"He answer’d, “yet with dazzling radiance dim"
9918,CANTO XV,"Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,"
9919,CANTO XV,"Inviting man’s ascent. Such sights ere long,"
9920,CANTO XV,"Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight,"
9921,CANTO XV,As thy perception is by nature wrought
9922,CANTO XV,"Up to their pitch.” The blessed angel, soon"
9923,CANTO XV,"As we had reach’d him, hail’d us with glad voice:"
9924,CANTO XV,“Here enter on a ladder far less steep
9925,CANTO XV,Than ye have yet encounter’d.” We forthwith
9926,CANTO XV,"Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet,"
9927,CANTO XV,"“Blessed the merciful,” and “happy thou!"
9928,CANTO XV,"That conquer’st.” Lonely each, my guide and I"
9929,CANTO XV,"Pursued our upward way; and as we went,"
9930,CANTO XV,"Some profit from his words I hop’d to win,"
9931,CANTO XV,"And thus of him inquiring, fram’d my speech:"
9932,CANTO XV,
9933,CANTO XV,"“What meant Romagna’s spirit, when he spake"
9934,CANTO XV,Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar’d?”
9935,CANTO XV,
9936,CANTO XV,"He straight replied: “No wonder, since he knows,"
9937,CANTO XV,"What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,"
9938,CANTO XV,"If he chide others, that they less may mourn."
9939,CANTO XV,"Because ye point your wishes at a mark,"
9940,CANTO XV,"Where, by communion of possessors, part"
9941,CANTO XV,"Is lessen’d, envy bloweth up the sighs of men."
9942,CANTO XV,"No fear of that might touch ye, if the love"
9943,CANTO XV,Of higher sphere exalted your desire.
9944,CANTO XV,"For there, by how much more they call it ours,"
9945,CANTO XV,So much propriety of each in good
9946,CANTO XV,"Increases more, and heighten’d charity"
9947,CANTO XV,Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.”
9948,CANTO XV,
9949,CANTO XV,"“Now lack I satisfaction more,” said I,"
9950,CANTO XV,"“Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,"
9951,CANTO XV,And doubt more gathers on my lab’ring thought.
9952,CANTO XV,"How can it chance, that good distributed,"
9953,CANTO XV,"The many, that possess it, makes more rich,"
9954,CANTO XV,Than if ’twere shar’d by few?” He answering thus:
9955,CANTO XV,"“Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,"
9956,CANTO XV,Strikes darkness from true light. The highest good
9957,CANTO XV,"Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed"
9958,CANTO XV,"To love, as beam to lucid body darts,"
9959,CANTO XV,Giving as much of ardour as it finds.
9960,CANTO XV,The sempiternal effluence streams abroad
9961,CANTO XV,"Spreading, wherever charity extends."
9962,CANTO XV,So that the more aspirants to that bliss
9963,CANTO XV,"Are multiplied, more good is there to love,"
9964,CANTO XV,"And more is lov’d; as mirrors, that reflect,"
9965,CANTO XV,"Each unto other, propagated light."
9966,CANTO XV,If these my words avail not to allay
9967,CANTO XV,"Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,"
9968,CANTO XV,"Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,"
9969,CANTO XV,Shall rid thee to the full. Provide but thou
9970,CANTO XV,"That from thy temples may be soon eras’d,"
9971,CANTO XV,"E’en as the two already, those five scars,"
9972,CANTO XV,"That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,”"
9973,CANTO XV,
9974,CANTO XV,"“Thou,” I had said, “content’st me,” when I saw"
9975,CANTO XV,"The other round was gain’d, and wond’ring eyes"
9976,CANTO XV,Did keep me mute. There suddenly I seem’d
9977,CANTO XV,By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;
9978,CANTO XV,"And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd"
9979,CANTO XV,Of many persons; and at th’ entrance stood
9980,CANTO XV,"A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express"
9981,CANTO XV,"A mother’s love, who said, “Child! why hast thou"
9982,CANTO XV,Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I
9983,CANTO XV,"Sorrowing have sought thee;” and so held her peace,"
9984,CANTO XV,And straight the vision fled. A female next
9985,CANTO XV,"Appear’d before me, down whose visage cours’d"
9986,CANTO XV,"Those waters, that grief forces out from one"
9987,CANTO XV,"By deep resentment stung, who seem’d to say:"
9988,CANTO XV,"“If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed"
9989,CANTO XV,"Over this city, nam’d with such debate"
9990,CANTO XV,"Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,"
9991,CANTO XV,"Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace"
9992,CANTO XV,"Hath clasp’d our daughter; “and to fuel, meseem’d,"
9993,CANTO XV,"Benign and meek, with visage undisturb’d,"
9994,CANTO XV,"Her sovran spake: “How shall we those requite,"
9995,CANTO XV,"Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn"
9996,CANTO XV,The man that loves us?” After that I saw
9997,CANTO XV,"A multitude, in fury burning, slay"
9998,CANTO XV,"With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain"
9999,CANTO XV,"“Destroy, destroy: “and him I saw, who bow’d"
10000,CANTO XV,"Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made"
10001,CANTO XV,"His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav’n,"
10002,CANTO XV,"Praying forgiveness of th’ Almighty Sire,"
10003,CANTO XV,"Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,"
10004,CANTO XV,"With looks, that With compassion to their aim."
10005,CANTO XV,
10006,CANTO XV,"Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight"
10007,CANTO XV,"Returning, sought again the things, whose truth"
10008,CANTO XV,"Depends not on her shaping, I observ’d"
10009,CANTO XV,How she had rov’d to no unreal scenes
10010,CANTO XV,
10011,CANTO XV,"Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov’d,"
10012,CANTO XV,"As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,"
10013,CANTO XV,"Exclaim’d: “What ails thee, that thou canst not hold"
10014,CANTO XV,"Thy footing firm, but more than half a league"
10015,CANTO XV,"Hast travel’d with clos’d eyes and tott’ring gait,"
10016,CANTO XV,Like to a man by wine or sleep o’ercharg’d?”
10017,CANTO XV,
10018,CANTO XV,"“Beloved father! so thou deign,” said I,"
10019,CANTO XV,"“To listen, I will tell thee what appear’d"
10020,CANTO XV,"Before me, when so fail’d my sinking steps.”"
10021,CANTO XV,
10022,CANTO XV,He thus: “Not if thy Countenance were mask’d
10023,CANTO XV,"With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine"
10024,CANTO XV,"How small soe’er, elude me. What thou saw’st"
10025,CANTO XV,"Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart"
10026,CANTO XV,"To the waters of peace, that flow diffus’d"
10027,CANTO XV,"From their eternal fountain. I not ask’d,"
10028,CANTO XV,"What ails thee? for such cause as he doth, who"
10029,CANTO XV,"Looks only with that eye which sees no more,"
10030,CANTO XV,"When spiritless the body lies; but ask’d,"
10031,CANTO XV,To give fresh vigour to thy foot. Such goads
10032,CANTO XV,The slow and loit’ring need; that they be found
10033,CANTO XV,"Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns.”"
10034,CANTO XV,
10035,CANTO XV,So on we journey’d through the evening sky
10036,CANTO XV,"Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes"
10037,CANTO XV,With level view could stretch against the bright
10038,CANTO XV,Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees
10039,CANTO XV,"Gath’ring, a fog made tow’rds us, dark as night."
10040,CANTO XV,There was no room for ’scaping; and that mist
10041,CANTO XV,"Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air."
10042,CANTO XV,
10043,CANTO XV,
10044,CANTO XV,
10045,CANTO XV,
10046,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
10047,CANTO XVI,
10048,CANTO XVI,
10049,CANTO XVI,"Hell’s dunnest gloom, or night unlustrous, dark,"
10050,CANTO XVI,"Of every planes ’reft, and pall’d in clouds,"
10051,CANTO XVI,Did never spread before the sight a veil
10052,CANTO XVI,"In thickness like that fog, nor to the sense"
10053,CANTO XVI,"So palpable and gross. Ent’ring its shade,"
10054,CANTO XVI,Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;
10055,CANTO XVI,"Which marking, near me drew the faithful guide,"
10056,CANTO XVI,Offering me his shoulder for a stay.
10057,CANTO XVI,
10058,CANTO XVI,"As the blind man behind his leader walks,"
10059,CANTO XVI,"Lest he should err, or stumble unawares"
10060,CANTO XVI,"On what might harm him, or perhaps destroy,"
10061,CANTO XVI,"I journey’d through that bitter air and foul,"
10062,CANTO XVI,"Still list’ning to my escort’s warning voice,"
10063,CANTO XVI,“Look that from me thou part not.” Straight I heard
10064,CANTO XVI,"Voices, and each one seem’d to pray for peace,"
10065,CANTO XVI,"And for compassion, to the Lamb of God"
10066,CANTO XVI,That taketh sins away. Their prelude still
10067,CANTO XVI,"Was “Agnus Dei,” and through all the choir,"
10068,CANTO XVI,"One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem’d"
10069,CANTO XVI,The concord of their song. “Are these I hear
10070,CANTO XVI,"Spirits, O master?” I exclaim’d; and he:"
10071,CANTO XVI,“Thou aim’st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.”
10072,CANTO XVI,
10073,CANTO XVI,"“Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?"
10074,CANTO XVI,"And speak’st of us, as thou thyself e’en yet"
10075,CANTO XVI,Dividest time by calends?” So one voice
10076,CANTO XVI,Bespake me; whence my master said: “Reply;
10077,CANTO XVI,"And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.”"
10078,CANTO XVI,
10079,CANTO XVI,"“O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand"
10080,CANTO XVI,Beautiful once more in thy Maker’s sight!
10081,CANTO XVI,Along with me: and thou shalt hear and wonder.”
10082,CANTO XVI,"Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:"
10083,CANTO XVI,"“Long as ’tis lawful for me, shall my steps"
10084,CANTO XVI,Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke
10085,CANTO XVI,"Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead"
10086,CANTO XVI,Shall keep us join’d.” I then forthwith began
10087,CANTO XVI,"“Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend"
10088,CANTO XVI,"To higher regions, and am hither come"
10089,CANTO XVI,Through the fearful agony of hell.
10090,CANTO XVI,"And, if so largely God hath doled his grace,"
10091,CANTO XVI,"That, clean beside all modern precedent,"
10092,CANTO XVI,"He wills me to behold his kingly state,"
10093,CANTO XVI,"From me conceal not who thou wast, ere death"
10094,CANTO XVI,Had loos’d thee; but instruct me: and instruct
10095,CANTO XVI,If rightly to the pass I tend; thy words
10096,CANTO XVI,The way directing as a safe escort.”
10097,CANTO XVI,
10098,CANTO XVI,"“I was of Lombardy, and Marco call’d:"
10099,CANTO XVI,"Not inexperienc’d of the world, that worth"
10100,CANTO XVI,"I still affected, from which all have turn’d"
10101,CANTO XVI,The nerveless bow aside. Thy course tends right
10102,CANTO XVI,"Unto the summit:” and, replying thus,"
10103,CANTO XVI,"He added, “I beseech thee pray for me,"
10104,CANTO XVI,When thou shalt come aloft.” And I to him:
10105,CANTO XVI,“Accept my faith for pledge I will perform
10106,CANTO XVI,"What thou requirest. Yet one doubt remains,"
10107,CANTO XVI,"That wrings me sorely, if I solve it not,"
10108,CANTO XVI,"Singly before it urg’d me, doubled now"
10109,CANTO XVI,"By thine opinion, when I couple that"
10110,CANTO XVI,"With one elsewhere declar’d, each strength’ning other."
10111,CANTO XVI,The world indeed is even so forlorn
10112,CANTO XVI,Of all good as thou speak’st it and so swarms
10113,CANTO XVI,"With every evil. Yet, beseech thee, point"
10114,CANTO XVI,"The cause out to me, that myself may see,"
10115,CANTO XVI,And unto others show it: for in heaven
10116,CANTO XVI,"One places it, and one on earth below.”"
10117,CANTO XVI,
10118,CANTO XVI,"Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,"
10119,CANTO XVI,"“Brother!” he thus began, “the world is blind;"
10120,CANTO XVI,"And thou in truth com’st from it. Ye, who live,"
10121,CANTO XVI,"Do so each cause refer to heav’n above,"
10122,CANTO XVI,E’en as its motion of necessity
10123,CANTO XVI,"Drew with it all that moves. If this were so,"
10124,CANTO XVI,Free choice in you were none; nor justice would
10125,CANTO XVI,"There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill."
10126,CANTO XVI,Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;
10127,CANTO XVI,Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?
10128,CANTO XVI,"Light have ye still to follow evil or good,"
10129,CANTO XVI,"And of the will free power, which, if it stand"
10130,CANTO XVI,"Firm and unwearied in Heav’n’s first assay,"
10131,CANTO XVI,"Conquers at last, so it be cherish’d well,"
10132,CANTO XVI,"Triumphant over all. To mightier force,"
10133,CANTO XVI,"To better nature subject, ye abide"
10134,CANTO XVI,"Free, not constrain’d by that, which forms in you"
10135,CANTO XVI,The reasoning mind uninfluenc’d of the stars.
10136,CANTO XVI,"If then the present race of mankind err,"
10137,CANTO XVI,"Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there."
10138,CANTO XVI,Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.
10139,CANTO XVI,
10140,CANTO XVI,"“Forth from his plastic hand, who charm’d beholds"
10141,CANTO XVI,"Her image ere she yet exist, the soul"
10142,CANTO XVI,"Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively"
10143,CANTO XVI,"Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,"
10144,CANTO XVI,"As artless and as ignorant of aught,"
10145,CANTO XVI,Save that her Maker being one who dwells
10146,CANTO XVI,"With gladness ever, willingly she turns"
10147,CANTO XVI,To whate’er yields her joy. Of some slight good
10148,CANTO XVI,"The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar’d by that,"
10149,CANTO XVI,"With fondness she pursues it, if no guide"
10150,CANTO XVI,"Recall, no rein direct her wand’ring course."
10151,CANTO XVI,"Hence it behov’d, the law should be a curb;"
10152,CANTO XVI,"A sovereign hence behov’d, whose piercing view"
10153,CANTO XVI,Might mark at least the fortress and main tower
10154,CANTO XVI,Of the true city. Laws indeed there are:
10155,CANTO XVI,"But who is he observes them? None; not he,"
10156,CANTO XVI,"Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,"
10157,CANTO XVI,Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.
10158,CANTO XVI,"Therefore the multitude, who see their guide"
10159,CANTO XVI,"Strike at the very good they covet most,"
10160,CANTO XVI,Feed there and look no further. Thus the cause
10161,CANTO XVI,"Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,"
10162,CANTO XVI,"But ill-conducting, that hath turn’d the world"
10163,CANTO XVI,"To evil. Rome, that turn’d it unto good,"
10164,CANTO XVI,"Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams"
10165,CANTO XVI,"Cast light on either way, the world’s and God’s."
10166,CANTO XVI,One since hath quench’d the other; and the sword
10167,CANTO XVI,Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin’d
10168,CANTO XVI,"Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw’d"
10169,CANTO XVI,"By fear of other. If thou doubt me, mark"
10170,CANTO XVI,The blade: each herb is judg’d of by its seed.
10171,CANTO XVI,"That land, through which Adice and the Po"
10172,CANTO XVI,"Their waters roll, was once the residence"
10173,CANTO XVI,"Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,"
10174,CANTO XVI,That frown’d on Frederick; now secure may pass
10175,CANTO XVI,"Those limits, whosoe’er hath left, for shame,"
10176,CANTO XVI,"To talk with good men, or come near their haunts."
10177,CANTO XVI,"Three aged ones are still found there, in whom"
10178,CANTO XVI,The old time chides the new: these deem it long
10179,CANTO XVI,Ere God restore them to a better world:
10180,CANTO XVI,"The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he"
10181,CANTO XVI,"Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam’d"
10182,CANTO XVI,In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.
10183,CANTO XVI,"On this at last conclude. The church of Rome,"
10184,CANTO XVI,"Mixing two governments that ill assort,"
10185,CANTO XVI,"Hath miss’d her footing, fall’n into the mire,"
10186,CANTO XVI,And there herself and burden much defil’d.”
10187,CANTO XVI,
10188,CANTO XVI,"“O Marco!” I replied, shine arguments"
10189,CANTO XVI,Convince me: and the cause I now discern
10190,CANTO XVI,Why of the heritage no portion came
10191,CANTO XVI,To Levi’s offspring. But resolve me this
10192,CANTO XVI,"Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst"
10193,CANTO XVI,"Is left a sample of the perish’d race,"
10194,CANTO XVI,And for rebuke to this untoward age?”
10195,CANTO XVI,
10196,CANTO XVI,"“Either thy words,” said he, “deceive; or else"
10197,CANTO XVI,"Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,"
10198,CANTO XVI,Appear’st not to have heard of good Gherado;
10199,CANTO XVI,"The sole addition that, by which I know him;"
10200,CANTO XVI,Unless I borrow’d from his daughter Gaia
10201,CANTO XVI,Another name to grace him. God be with you.
10202,CANTO XVI,I bear you company no more. Behold
10203,CANTO XVI,The dawn with white ray glimm’ring through the mist.
10204,CANTO XVI,I must away—the angel comes—ere he
10205,CANTO XVI,"Appear.” He said, and would not hear me more."
10206,CANTO XVI,
10207,CANTO XVI,
10208,CANTO XVI,
10209,CANTO XVI,
10210,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
10211,CANTO XVII,
10212,CANTO XVII,
10213,CANTO XVII,"Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e’er"
10214,CANTO XVII,"Hast, on a mountain top, been ta’en by cloud,"
10215,CANTO XVII,"Through which thou saw’st no better, than the mole"
10216,CANTO XVII,"Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene’er"
10217,CANTO XVII,The wat’ry vapours dense began to melt
10218,CANTO XVII,"Into thin air, how faintly the sun’s sphere"
10219,CANTO XVII,Seem’d wading through them; so thy nimble thought
10220,CANTO XVII,"May image, how at first I re-beheld"
10221,CANTO XVII,"The sun, that bedward now his couch o’erhung."
10222,CANTO XVII,
10223,CANTO XVII,Thus with my leader’s feet still equaling pace
10224,CANTO XVII,"From forth that cloud I came, when now expir’d"
10225,CANTO XVII,The parting beams from off the nether shores.
10226,CANTO XVII,
10227,CANTO XVII,O quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost
10228,CANTO XVII,"So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark"
10229,CANTO XVII,Though round about us thousand trumpets clang!
10230,CANTO XVII,"What moves thee, if the senses stir not? Light"
10231,CANTO XVII,"Kindled in heav’n, spontaneous, self-inform’d,"
10232,CANTO XVII,Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse
10233,CANTO XVII,By will divine. Portray’d before me came
10234,CANTO XVII,"The traces of her dire impiety,"
10235,CANTO XVII,"Whose form was chang’d into the bird, that most"
10236,CANTO XVII,Delights itself in song: and here my mind
10237,CANTO XVII,"Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place"
10238,CANTO XVII,To aught that ask’d admittance from without.
10239,CANTO XVII,
10240,CANTO XVII,Next shower’d into my fantasy a shape
10241,CANTO XVII,"As of one crucified, whose visage spake"
10242,CANTO XVII,"Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;"
10243,CANTO XVII,"And round him Ahasuerus the great king,"
10244,CANTO XVII,"Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,"
10245,CANTO XVII,Blameless in word and deed. As of itself
10246,CANTO XVII,That unsubstantial coinage of the brain
10247,CANTO XVII,"Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails"
10248,CANTO XVII,That fed it; in my vision straight uprose
10249,CANTO XVII,"A damsel weeping loud, and cried, “O queen!"
10250,CANTO XVII,O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire
10251,CANTO XVII,Driv’n thee to loath thy being? Not to lose
10252,CANTO XVII,"Lavinia, desp’rate thou hast slain thyself."
10253,CANTO XVII,"Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears"
10254,CANTO XVII,"Mourn, ere I fall, a mother’s timeless end.”"
10255,CANTO XVII,
10256,CANTO XVII,"E’en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly"
10257,CANTO XVII,"New radiance strike upon the closed lids,"
10258,CANTO XVII,The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;
10259,CANTO XVII,Thus from before me sunk that imagery
10260,CANTO XVII,"Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck"
10261,CANTO XVII,"The light, outshining far our earthly beam."
10262,CANTO XVII,As round I turn’d me to survey what place
10263,CANTO XVII,"I had arriv’d at, “Here ye mount,” exclaim’d"
10264,CANTO XVII,"A voice, that other purpose left me none,"
10265,CANTO XVII,"Save will so eager to behold who spake,"
10266,CANTO XVII,"I could not choose but gaze. As ’fore the sun,"
10267,CANTO XVII,"That weighs our vision down, and veils his form"
10268,CANTO XVII,"In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail’d"
10269,CANTO XVII,"Unequal. “This is Spirit from above,"
10270,CANTO XVII,"Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;"
10271,CANTO XVII,And in his own light shrouds him;. As a man
10272,CANTO XVII,"Doth for himself, so now is done for us."
10273,CANTO XVII,"For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need"
10274,CANTO XVII,"Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar’d"
10275,CANTO XVII,"For blunt denial, ere the suit be made."
10276,CANTO XVII,Refuse we not to lend a ready foot
10277,CANTO XVII,"At such inviting: haste we to ascend,"
10278,CANTO XVII,"Before it darken: for we may not then,"
10279,CANTO XVII,Till morn again return.” So spake my guide;
10280,CANTO XVII,And to one ladder both address’d our steps;
10281,CANTO XVII,"And the first stair approaching, I perceiv’d"
10282,CANTO XVII,"Near me as ’twere the waving of a wing,"
10283,CANTO XVII,That fann’d my face and whisper’d: “Blessed they
10284,CANTO XVII,The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.”
10285,CANTO XVII,
10286,CANTO XVII,Now to such height above our heads were rais’d
10287,CANTO XVII,"The last beams, follow’d close by hooded night,"
10288,CANTO XVII,That many a star on all sides through the gloom
10289,CANTO XVII,"Shone out. “Why partest from me, O my strength?”"
10290,CANTO XVII,So with myself I commun’d; for I felt
10291,CANTO XVII,My o’ertoil’d sinews slacken. We had reach’d
10292,CANTO XVII,"The summit, and were fix’d like to a bark"
10293,CANTO XVII,"Arriv’d at land. And waiting a short space,"
10294,CANTO XVII,"If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,"
10295,CANTO XVII,"Then to my guide I turn’d, and said: “Lov’d sire!"
10296,CANTO XVII,Declare what guilt is on this circle purg’d.
10297,CANTO XVII,"If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.”"
10298,CANTO XVII,
10299,CANTO XVII,"He thus to me: “The love of good, whate’er"
10300,CANTO XVII,"Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils."
10301,CANTO XVII,"Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter’d ill."
10302,CANTO XVII,"But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,"
10303,CANTO XVII,"Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull"
10304,CANTO XVII,"Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay."
10305,CANTO XVII,
10306,CANTO XVII,"“Creator, nor created being, ne’er,"
10307,CANTO XVII,"My son,” he thus began, “was without love,"
10308,CANTO XVII,"Or natural, or the free spirit’s growth."
10309,CANTO XVII,Thou hast not that to learn. The natural still
10310,CANTO XVII,"Is without error; but the other swerves,"
10311,CANTO XVII,"If on ill object bent, or through excess"
10312,CANTO XVII,"Of vigour, or defect. While e’er it seeks"
10313,CANTO XVII,"The primal blessings, or with measure due"
10314,CANTO XVII,"Th’ inferior, no delight, that flows from it,"
10315,CANTO XVII,"Partakes of ill. But let it warp to evil,"
10316,CANTO XVII,"Or with more ardour than behooves, or less."
10317,CANTO XVII,"Pursue the good, the thing created then"
10318,CANTO XVII,Works ’gainst its Maker. Hence thou must infer
10319,CANTO XVII,"That love is germin of each virtue in ye,"
10320,CANTO XVII,"And of each act no less, that merits pain."
10321,CANTO XVII,"Now since it may not be, but love intend"
10322,CANTO XVII,"The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,"
10323,CANTO XVII,All from self-hatred are secure; and since
10324,CANTO XVII,No being can be thought t’ exist apart
10325,CANTO XVII,"And independent of the first, a bar"
10326,CANTO XVII,Of equal force restrains from hating that.
10327,CANTO XVII,
10328,CANTO XVII,“Grant the distinction just; and it remains
10329,CANTO XVII,"The’ evil must be another’s, which is lov’d."
10330,CANTO XVII,Three ways such love is gender’d in your clay.
10331,CANTO XVII,"There is who hopes (his neighbour’s worth deprest,)"
10332,CANTO XVII,"Preeminence himself, and coverts hence"
10333,CANTO XVII,For his own greatness that another fall.
10334,CANTO XVII,"There is who so much fears the loss of power,"
10335,CANTO XVII,"Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount"
10336,CANTO XVII,"Above him), and so sickens at the thought,"
10337,CANTO XVII,"He loves their opposite: and there is he,"
10338,CANTO XVII,Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame
10339,CANTO XVII,"That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs"
10340,CANTO XVII,Must doat on other’s evil. Here beneath
10341,CANTO XVII,This threefold love is mourn’d. Of th’ other sort
10342,CANTO XVII,"Be now instructed, that which follows good"
10343,CANTO XVII,But with disorder’d and irregular course.
10344,CANTO XVII,
10345,CANTO XVII,“All indistinctly apprehend a bliss
10346,CANTO XVII,"On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all"
10347,CANTO XVII,"Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn"
10348,CANTO XVII,All therefore strive to tend. If ye behold
10349,CANTO XVII,"Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,"
10350,CANTO XVII,This cornice after just repenting lays
10351,CANTO XVII,Its penal torment on ye. Other good
10352,CANTO XVII,"There is, where man finds not his happiness:"
10353,CANTO XVII,"It is not true fruition, not that blest"
10354,CANTO XVII,"Essence, of every good the branch and root."
10355,CANTO XVII,"The love too lavishly bestow’d on this,"
10356,CANTO XVII,"Along three circles over us, is mourn’d."
10357,CANTO XVII,Account of that division tripartite
10358,CANTO XVII,"Expect not, fitter for thine own research."
10359,CANTO XVII,
10360,CANTO XVII,
10361,CANTO XVII,
10362,CANTO XVII,
10363,CANTO XVIII,CANTO XVIII
10364,CANTO XVIII,
10365,CANTO XVIII,
10366,CANTO XVIII,"The teacher ended, and his high discourse"
10367,CANTO XVIII,"Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir’d"
10368,CANTO XVIII,"If I appear’d content; and I, whom still"
10369,CANTO XVIII,"Unsated thirst to hear him urg’d, was mute,"
10370,CANTO XVIII,"Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:"
10371,CANTO XVIII,“Perchance my too much questioning offends
10372,CANTO XVIII,"But he, true father, mark’d the secret wish"
10373,CANTO XVIII,"By diffidence restrain’d, and speaking, gave"
10374,CANTO XVIII,"Me boldness thus to speak: “Master, my Sight"
10375,CANTO XVIII,"Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,"
10376,CANTO XVIII,"That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen."
10377,CANTO XVIII,"Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart"
10378,CANTO XVIII,Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t’ unfold
10379,CANTO XVIII,"That love, from which as from their source thou bring’st"
10380,CANTO XVIII,All good deeds and their opposite.” He then:
10381,CANTO XVIII,“To what I now disclose be thy clear ken
10382,CANTO XVIII,"Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold"
10383,CANTO XVIII,"How much those blind have err’d, who make themselves"
10384,CANTO XVIII,"The guides of men. The soul, created apt"
10385,CANTO XVIII,"To love, moves versatile which way soe’er"
10386,CANTO XVIII,"Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak’d"
10387,CANTO XVIII,By pleasure into act. Of substance true
10388,CANTO XVIII,"Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,"
10389,CANTO XVIII,And in you the ideal shape presenting
10390,CANTO XVIII,"Attracts the soul’s regard. If she, thus drawn,"
10391,CANTO XVIII,"incline toward it, love is that inclining,"
10392,CANTO XVIII,And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.
10393,CANTO XVIII,"Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks"
10394,CANTO XVIII,"His birth-place and his lasting seat, e’en thus"
10395,CANTO XVIII,"Enters the captive soul into desire,"
10396,CANTO XVIII,"Which is a spiritual motion, that ne’er rests"
10397,CANTO XVIII,Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.
10398,CANTO XVIII,"Enough to show thee, how the truth from those"
10399,CANTO XVIII,"Is hidden, who aver all love a thing"
10400,CANTO XVIII,Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps
10401,CANTO XVIII,Its substance seem still good. Yet if the wax
10402,CANTO XVIII,"Be good, it follows not th’ impression must.”"
10403,CANTO XVIII,"“What love is,” I return’d, “thy words, O guide!"
10404,CANTO XVIII,"And my own docile mind, reveal. Yet thence"
10405,CANTO XVIII,New doubts have sprung. For from without if love
10406,CANTO XVIII,"Be offer’d to us, and the spirit knows"
10407,CANTO XVIII,"No other footing, tend she right or wrong,"
10408,CANTO XVIII,Is no desert of hers.” He answering thus:
10409,CANTO XVIII,“What reason here discovers I have power
10410,CANTO XVIII,"To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect"
10411,CANTO XVIII,"From Beatrice, faith not reason’s task."
10412,CANTO XVIII,"Spirit, substantial form, with matter join’d"
10413,CANTO XVIII,"Not in confusion mix’d, hath in itself"
10414,CANTO XVIII,"Specific virtue of that union born,"
10415,CANTO XVIII,"Which is not felt except it work, nor prov’d"
10416,CANTO XVIII,"But through effect, as vegetable life"
10417,CANTO XVIII,By the green leaf. From whence his intellect
10418,CANTO XVIII,"Deduced its primal notices of things,"
10419,CANTO XVIII,"Man therefore knows not, or his appetites"
10420,CANTO XVIII,"Their first affections; such in you, as zeal"
10421,CANTO XVIII,"In bees to gather honey; at the first,"
10422,CANTO XVIII,"Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise."
10423,CANTO XVIII,"But o’er each lower faculty supreme,"
10424,CANTO XVIII,"That as she list are summon’d to her bar,"
10425,CANTO XVIII,"Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice"
10426,CANTO XVIII,"Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep"
10427,CANTO XVIII,"The threshold of assent. Here is the source,"
10428,CANTO XVIII,"Whence cause of merit in you is deriv’d,"
10429,CANTO XVIII,"E’en as the affections good or ill she takes,"
10430,CANTO XVIII,"Or severs, winnow’d as the chaff. Those men"
10431,CANTO XVIII,"Who reas’ning went to depth profoundest, mark’d"
10432,CANTO XVIII,"That innate freedom, and were thence induc’d"
10433,CANTO XVIII,To leave their moral teaching to the world.
10434,CANTO XVIII,"Grant then, that from necessity arise"
10435,CANTO XVIII,All love that glows within you; to dismiss
10436,CANTO XVIII,"Or harbour it, the pow’r is in yourselves."
10437,CANTO XVIII,"Remember, Beatrice, in her style,"
10438,CANTO XVIII,Denominates free choice by eminence
10439,CANTO XVIII,"The noble virtue, if in talk with thee"
10440,CANTO XVIII,"She touch upon that theme.” The moon, well nigh"
10441,CANTO XVIII,"To midnight hour belated, made the stars"
10442,CANTO XVIII,Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk
10443,CANTO XVIII,"Seem’d like a crag on fire, as up the vault"
10444,CANTO XVIII,"That course she journey’d, which the sun then warms,"
10445,CANTO XVIII,When they of Rome behold him at his set.
10446,CANTO XVIII,Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.
10447,CANTO XVIII,"And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,"
10448,CANTO XVIII,"Was lighten’d by the aid of that clear spirit,"
10449,CANTO XVIII,Who raiseth Andes above Mantua’s name.
10450,CANTO XVIII,"I therefore, when my questions had obtain’d"
10451,CANTO XVIII,"Solution plain and ample, stood as one"
10452,CANTO XVIII,Musing in dreary slumber; but not long
10453,CANTO XVIII,"Slumber’d; for suddenly a multitude,"
10454,CANTO XVIII,"The steep already turning, from behind,"
10455,CANTO XVIII,"Rush’d on. With fury and like random rout,"
10456,CANTO XVIII,As echoing on their shores at midnight heard
10457,CANTO XVIII,"Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes"
10458,CANTO XVIII,If Bacchus’ help were needed; so came these
10459,CANTO XVIII,"Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,"
10460,CANTO XVIII,By eagerness impell’d of holy love.
10461,CANTO XVIII,
10462,CANTO XVIII,Soon they o’ertook us; with such swiftness mov’d
10463,CANTO XVIII,The mighty crowd. Two spirits at their head
10464,CANTO XVIII,Cried weeping; “Blessed Mary sought with haste
10465,CANTO XVIII,The hilly region. Caesar to subdue
10466,CANTO XVIII,"Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,"
10467,CANTO XVIII,And flew to Spain.”—“Oh tarry not: away;”
10468,CANTO XVIII,The others shouted; “let not time be lost
10469,CANTO XVIII,Through slackness of affection. Hearty zeal
10470,CANTO XVIII,To serve reanimates celestial grace.”
10471,CANTO XVIII,
10472,CANTO XVIII,"“O ye, in whom intenser fervency"
10473,CANTO XVIII,"Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail’d,"
10474,CANTO XVIII,"Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part"
10475,CANTO XVIII,"Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,"
10476,CANTO XVIII,"(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t’ ascend,"
10477,CANTO XVIII,So morning rise to light us. Therefore say
10478,CANTO XVIII,Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?”
10479,CANTO XVIII,
10480,CANTO XVIII,"So spake my guide, to whom a shade return’d:"
10481,CANTO XVIII,"“Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft."
10482,CANTO XVIII,We may not linger: such resistless will
10483,CANTO XVIII,Speeds our unwearied course. Vouchsafe us then
10484,CANTO XVIII,"Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee"
10485,CANTO XVIII,Discourteous rudeness. In Verona I
10486,CANTO XVIII,"Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand"
10487,CANTO XVIII,"Of Barbarossa grasp’d Imperial sway,"
10488,CANTO XVIII,"That name, ne’er utter’d without tears in Milan."
10489,CANTO XVIII,"And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,"
10490,CANTO XVIII,"Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,"
10491,CANTO XVIII,"Ruing his power misus’d: for that his son,"
10492,CANTO XVIII,"Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,"
10493,CANTO XVIII,"And born in evil, he hath set in place"
10494,CANTO XVIII,"Of its true pastor.” Whether more he spake,"
10495,CANTO XVIII,"Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped"
10496,CANTO XVIII,E’en now so far beyond us. Yet thus much
10497,CANTO XVIII,"I heard, and in rememb’rance treasur’d it."
10498,CANTO XVIII,
10499,CANTO XVIII,"He then, who never fail’d me at my need,"
10500,CANTO XVIII,"Cried, “Hither turn. Lo! two with sharp remorse"
10501,CANTO XVIII,Chiding their sin!” In rear of all the troop
10502,CANTO XVIII,"These shouted: “First they died, to whom the sea"
10503,CANTO XVIII,"Open’d, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:"
10504,CANTO XVIII,"And they, who with Aeneas to the end"
10505,CANTO XVIII,"Endur’d not suffering, for their portion chose"
10506,CANTO XVIII,Life without glory.” Soon as they had fled
10507,CANTO XVIII,"Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose"
10508,CANTO XVIII,"By others follow’d fast, and each unlike"
10509,CANTO XVIII,"Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,"
10510,CANTO XVIII,"And pleasur’d with the fleeting train, mine eye"
10511,CANTO XVIII,"Was clos’d, and meditation chang’d to dream."
10512,CANTO XVIII,
10513,CANTO XVIII,
10514,CANTO XVIII,
10515,CANTO XVIII,
10516,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
10517,CANTO XIX,
10518,CANTO XIX,
10519,CANTO XIX,"It was the hour, when of diurnal heat"
10520,CANTO XIX,"No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,"
10521,CANTO XIX,"O’erpower’d by earth, or planetary sway"
10522,CANTO XIX,Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees
10523,CANTO XIX,"His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,"
10524,CANTO XIX,Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;
10525,CANTO XIX,When ’fore me in my dream a woman’s shape
10526,CANTO XIX,"There came, with lips that stammer’d, eyes aslant,"
10527,CANTO XIX,"Distorted feet, hands maim’d, and colour pale."
10528,CANTO XIX,
10529,CANTO XIX,I look’d upon her; and as sunshine cheers
10530,CANTO XIX,"Limbs numb’d by nightly cold, e’en thus my look"
10531,CANTO XIX,"Unloos’d her tongue, next in brief space her form"
10532,CANTO XIX,"Decrepit rais’d erect, and faded face"
10533,CANTO XIX,With love’s own hue illum’d. Recov’ring speech
10534,CANTO XIX,"She forthwith warbling such a strain began,"
10535,CANTO XIX,"That I, how loth soe’er, could scarce have held"
10536,CANTO XIX,"Attention from the song. “I,” thus she sang,"
10537,CANTO XIX,"“I am the Siren, she, whom mariners"
10538,CANTO XIX,On the wide sea are wilder’d when they hear:
10539,CANTO XIX,Such fulness of delight the list’ner feels.
10540,CANTO XIX,I from his course Ulysses by my lay
10541,CANTO XIX,Enchanted drew. Whoe’er frequents me once
10542,CANTO XIX,"Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart"
10543,CANTO XIX,Contented knows no void.” Or ere her mouth
10544,CANTO XIX,"Was clos’d, to shame her at her side appear’d"
10545,CANTO XIX,A dame of semblance holy. With stern voice
10546,CANTO XIX,"She utter’d; “Say, O Virgil, who is this?”"
10547,CANTO XIX,"Which hearing, he approach’d, with eyes still bent"
10548,CANTO XIX,"Toward that goodly presence: th’ other seiz’d her,"
10549,CANTO XIX,"And, her robes tearing, open’d her before,"
10550,CANTO XIX,"And show’d the belly to me, whence a smell,"
10551,CANTO XIX,"Exhaling loathsome, wak’d me. Round I turn’d"
10552,CANTO XIX,"Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: “At the least"
10553,CANTO XIX,"Three times my voice hath call’d thee. Rise, begone."
10554,CANTO XIX,Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass.”
10555,CANTO XIX,
10556,CANTO XIX,"I straightway rose. Now day, pour’d down from high,"
10557,CANTO XIX,Fill’d all the circuits of the sacred mount;
10558,CANTO XIX,"And, as we journey’d, on our shoulder smote"
10559,CANTO XIX,"The early ray. I follow’d, stooping low"
10560,CANTO XIX,"My forehead, as a man, o’ercharg’d with thought,"
10561,CANTO XIX,"Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,"
10562,CANTO XIX,"That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,"
10563,CANTO XIX,"“Come, enter here,” in tone so soft and mild,"
10564,CANTO XIX,As never met the ear on mortal strand.
10565,CANTO XIX,
10566,CANTO XIX,"With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,"
10567,CANTO XIX,"Who thus had spoken marshal’d us along,"
10568,CANTO XIX,Where each side of the solid masonry
10569,CANTO XIX,"The sloping, walls retir’d; then mov’d his plumes,"
10570,CANTO XIX,"And fanning us, affirm’d that those, who mourn,"
10571,CANTO XIX,"Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs."
10572,CANTO XIX,
10573,CANTO XIX,"“What aileth thee, that still thou look’st to earth?”"
10574,CANTO XIX,Began my leader; while th’ angelic shape
10575,CANTO XIX,A little over us his station took.
10576,CANTO XIX,
10577,CANTO XIX,"“New vision,” I replied, “hath rais’d in me"
10578,CANTO XIX,"8urmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon"
10579,CANTO XIX,My soul intent allows no other thought
10580,CANTO XIX,"Or room or entrance.—“Hast thou seen,” said he,"
10581,CANTO XIX,"“That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone"
10582,CANTO XIX,The spirits o’er us weep for? Hast thou seen
10583,CANTO XIX,How man may free him of her bonds? Enough.
10584,CANTO XIX,"Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais’d ken"
10585,CANTO XIX,"Fix on the lure, which heav’n’s eternal King"
10586,CANTO XIX,Whirls in the rolling spheres.” As on his feet
10587,CANTO XIX,"The falcon first looks down, then to the sky"
10588,CANTO XIX,"Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,"
10589,CANTO XIX,"That woos him thither; so the call I heard,"
10590,CANTO XIX,"So onward, far as the dividing rock"
10591,CANTO XIX,"Gave way, I journey’d, till the plain was reach’d."
10592,CANTO XIX,
10593,CANTO XIX,"On the fifth circle when I stood at large,"
10594,CANTO XIX,"A race appear’d before me, on the ground"
10595,CANTO XIX,All downward lying prone and weeping sore.
10596,CANTO XIX,"“My soul hath cleaved to the dust,” I heard"
10597,CANTO XIX,"With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak’d the words."
10598,CANTO XIX,"“O ye elect of God, whose penal woes"
10599,CANTO XIX,"Both hope and justice mitigate, direct"
10600,CANTO XIX,Tow’rds the steep rising our uncertain way.”
10601,CANTO XIX,
10602,CANTO XIX,"“If ye approach secure from this our doom,"
10603,CANTO XIX,"Prostration—and would urge your course with speed,"
10604,CANTO XIX,See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.”
10605,CANTO XIX,
10606,CANTO XIX,"So them the bard besought; and such the words,"
10607,CANTO XIX,"Beyond us some short space, in answer came."
10608,CANTO XIX,
10609,CANTO XIX,I noted what remain’d yet hidden from them:
10610,CANTO XIX,"Thence to my liege’s eyes mine eyes I bent,"
10611,CANTO XIX,"And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,"
10612,CANTO XIX,"Beckon’d his glad assent. Free then to act,"
10613,CANTO XIX,"As pleas’d me, I drew near, and took my stand"
10614,CANTO XIX,"O`er that shade, whose words I late had mark’d."
10615,CANTO XIX,"And, “Spirit!” I said, “in whom repentant tears"
10616,CANTO XIX,"Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God"
10617,CANTO XIX,"Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend"
10618,CANTO XIX,"For me that mightier care. Say who thou wast,"
10619,CANTO XIX,"Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,"
10620,CANTO XIX,"And if in aught ye wish my service there,"
10621,CANTO XIX,Whence living I am come.” He answering spake
10622,CANTO XIX,“The cause why Heav’n our back toward his cope
10623,CANTO XIX,"Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first"
10624,CANTO XIX,"The successor of Peter, and the name"
10625,CANTO XIX,"And title of my lineage from that stream,"
10626,CANTO XIX,That’ twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws
10627,CANTO XIX,His limpid waters through the lowly glen.
10628,CANTO XIX,"A month and little more by proof I learnt,"
10629,CANTO XIX,With what a weight that robe of sov’reignty
10630,CANTO XIX,"Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire"
10631,CANTO XIX,Would guard it: that each other fardel seems
10632,CANTO XIX,"But feathers in the balance. Late, alas!"
10633,CANTO XIX,Was my conversion: but when I became
10634,CANTO XIX,"Rome’s pastor, I discern’d at once the dream"
10635,CANTO XIX,"And cozenage of life, saw that the heart"
10636,CANTO XIX,"Rested not there, and yet no prouder height"
10637,CANTO XIX,"Lur’d on the climber: wherefore, of that life"
10638,CANTO XIX,"No more enamour’d, in my bosom love"
10639,CANTO XIX,Of purer being kindled. For till then
10640,CANTO XIX,"I was a soul in misery, alienate"
10641,CANTO XIX,"From God, and covetous of all earthly things;"
10642,CANTO XIX,"Now, as thou seest, here punish’d for my doting."
10643,CANTO XIX,Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
10644,CANTO XIX,Do spirits converted need. This mount inflicts
10645,CANTO XIX,No direr penalty. E’en as our eyes
10646,CANTO XIX,"Fasten’d below, nor e’er to loftier clime"
10647,CANTO XIX,"Were lifted, thus hath justice level’d us"
10648,CANTO XIX,Here on the earth. As avarice quench’d our love
10649,CANTO XIX,"Of good, without which is no working, thus"
10650,CANTO XIX,"Here justice holds us prison’d, hand and foot"
10651,CANTO XIX,"Chain’d down and bound, while heaven’s just Lord shall please."
10652,CANTO XIX,So long to tarry motionless outstretch’d.”
10653,CANTO XIX,
10654,CANTO XIX,"My knees I stoop’d, and would have spoke; but he,"
10655,CANTO XIX,"Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv’d"
10656,CANTO XIX,"I did him reverence; and “What cause,” said he,"
10657,CANTO XIX,"“Hath bow’d thee thus!”—” Compunction,” I rejoin’d."
10658,CANTO XIX,“And inward awe of your high dignity.”
10659,CANTO XIX,
10660,CANTO XIX,"“Up,” he exclaim’d, “brother! upon thy feet"
10661,CANTO XIX,"Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,"
10662,CANTO XIX,(Thine and all others’) of one Sovran Power.
10663,CANTO XIX,If thou hast ever mark’d those holy sounds
10664,CANTO XIX,"Of gospel truth, ‘nor shall be given ill marriage,’"
10665,CANTO XIX,Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.
10666,CANTO XIX,Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.
10667,CANTO XIX,"Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,"
10668,CANTO XIX,With which I hasten that whereof thou spak’st.
10669,CANTO XIX,I have on earth a kinswoman; her name
10670,CANTO XIX,"Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill"
10671,CANTO XIX,Example of our house corrupt her not:
10672,CANTO XIX,And she is all remaineth of me there.”
10673,CANTO XIX,

10679,CANTO XX,
10680,CANTO XX,"Ill strives the will, ’gainst will more wise that strives"
10681,CANTO XX,"His pleasure therefore to mine own preferr’d,"
10682,CANTO XX,I drew the sponge yet thirsty from the wave.
10683,CANTO XX,
10684,CANTO XX,"Onward I mov’d: he also onward mov’d,"
10685,CANTO XX,"Who led me, coasting still, wherever place"
10686,CANTO XX,"Along the rock was vacant, as a man"
10687,CANTO XX,Walks near the battlements on narrow wall.
10688,CANTO XX,"For those on th’ other part, who drop by drop"
10689,CANTO XX,"Wring out their all-infecting malady,"
10690,CANTO XX,Too closely press the verge. Accurst be thou!
10691,CANTO XX,"Inveterate wolf! whose gorge ingluts more prey,"
10692,CANTO XX,"Than every beast beside, yet is not fill’d!"
10693,CANTO XX,So bottomless thy maw!—Ye spheres of heaven!
10694,CANTO XX,"To whom there are, as seems, who attribute"
10695,CANTO XX,"All change in mortal state, when is the day"
10696,CANTO XX,"Of his appearing, for whom fate reserves"
10697,CANTO XX,To chase her hence?—With wary steps and slow
10698,CANTO XX,"We pass’d; and I attentive to the shades,"
10699,CANTO XX,Whom piteously I heard lament and wail;
10700,CANTO XX,"And, ’midst the wailing, one before us heard"
10701,CANTO XX,Cry out “O blessed Virgin!” as a dame
10702,CANTO XX,In the sharp pangs of childbed; and “How poor
10703,CANTO XX,"Thou wast,” it added, “witness that low roof"
10704,CANTO XX,Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.
10705,CANTO XX,O good Fabricius! thou didst virtue choose
10706,CANTO XX,"With poverty, before great wealth with vice.”"
10707,CANTO XX,
10708,CANTO XX,"The words so pleas’d me, that desire to know"
10709,CANTO XX,"The spirit, from whose lip they seem’d to come,"
10710,CANTO XX,Did draw me onward. Yet it spake the gift
10711,CANTO XX,"Of Nicholas, which on the maidens he"
10712,CANTO XX,"Bounteous bestow’d, to save their youthful prime"
10713,CANTO XX,Unblemish’d. “Spirit! who dost speak of deeds
10714,CANTO XX,"So worthy, tell me who thou was,” I said,"
10715,CANTO XX,“And why thou dost with single voice renew
10716,CANTO XX,Memorial of such praise. That boon vouchsaf’d
10717,CANTO XX,Haply shall meet reward; if I return
10718,CANTO XX,"To finish the Short pilgrimage of life,"
10719,CANTO XX,Still speeding to its close on restless wing.”
10720,CANTO XX,
10721,CANTO XX,"“I,” answer’d he, “will tell thee, not for hell,"
10722,CANTO XX,Which thence I look for; but that in thyself
10723,CANTO XX,"Grace so exceeding shines, before thy time"
10724,CANTO XX,Of mortal dissolution. I was root
10725,CANTO XX,"Of that ill plant, whose shade such poison sheds"
10726,CANTO XX,"O’er all the Christian land, that seldom thence"
10727,CANTO XX,"Good fruit is gather’d. Vengeance soon should come,"
10728,CANTO XX,"Had Ghent and Douay, Lille and Bruges power;"
10729,CANTO XX,And vengeance I of heav’n’s great Judge implore.
10730,CANTO XX,Hugh Capet was I high: from me descend
10731,CANTO XX,"The Philips and the Louis, of whom France"
10732,CANTO XX,"Newly is govern’d; born of one, who ply’d"
10733,CANTO XX,The slaughterer’s trade at Paris. When the race
10734,CANTO XX,Of ancient kings had vanish’d (all save one
10735,CANTO XX,Wrapt up in sable weeds) within my gripe
10736,CANTO XX,"I found the reins of empire, and such powers"
10737,CANTO XX,"Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,"
10738,CANTO XX,That soon the widow’d circlet of the crown
10739,CANTO XX,"Was girt upon the temples of my son,"
10740,CANTO XX,"He, from whose bones th’ anointed race begins."
10741,CANTO XX,Till the great dower of Provence had remov’d
10742,CANTO XX,"The stains, that yet obscur’d our lowly blood,"
10743,CANTO XX,"Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe’er"
10744,CANTO XX,"It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,"
10745,CANTO XX,"Began its rapine; after, for amends,"
10746,CANTO XX,"Poitou it seiz’d, Navarre and Gascony."
10747,CANTO XX,"To Italy came Charles, and for amends"
10748,CANTO XX,"Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,"
10749,CANTO XX,"And sent th’ angelic teacher back to heav’n,"
10750,CANTO XX,"Still for amends. I see the time at hand,"
10751,CANTO XX,That forth from France invites another Charles
10752,CANTO XX,To make himself and kindred better known.
10753,CANTO XX,"Unarm’d he issues, saving with that lance,"
10754,CANTO XX,Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that
10755,CANTO XX,"He carries with so home a thrust, as rives"
10756,CANTO XX,The bowels of poor Florence. No increase
10757,CANTO XX,"Of territory hence, but sin and shame"
10758,CANTO XX,"Shall be his guerdon, and so much the more"
10759,CANTO XX,As he more lightly deems of such foul wrong.
10760,CANTO XX,"I see the other, who a prisoner late"
10761,CANTO XX,"Had steps on shore, exposing to the mart"
10762,CANTO XX,"His daughter, whom he bargains for, as do"
10763,CANTO XX,The Corsairs for their slaves. O avarice!
10764,CANTO XX,"What canst thou more, who hast subdued our blood"
10765,CANTO XX,"So wholly to thyself, they feel no care"
10766,CANTO XX,Of their own flesh? To hide with direr guilt
10767,CANTO XX,"Past ill and future, lo! the flower-de-luce"
10768,CANTO XX,Enters Alagna! in his Vicar Christ
10769,CANTO XX,"Himself a captive, and his mockery"
10770,CANTO XX,Acted again! Lo! to his holy lip
10771,CANTO XX,The vinegar and gall once more applied!
10772,CANTO XX,And he ’twixt living robbers doom’d to bleed!
10773,CANTO XX,"Lo! the new Pilate, of whose cruelty"
10774,CANTO XX,"Such violence cannot fill the measure up,"
10775,CANTO XX,"With no degree to sanction, pushes on"
10776,CANTO XX,Into the temple his yet eager sails!
10777,CANTO XX,
10778,CANTO XX,“O sovran Master! when shall I rejoice
10779,CANTO XX,"To see the vengeance, which thy wrath well-pleas’d"
10780,CANTO XX,"In secret silence broods?—While daylight lasts,"
10781,CANTO XX,"So long what thou didst hear of her, sole spouse"
10782,CANTO XX,"Of the Great Spirit, and on which thou turn’dst"
10783,CANTO XX,"To me for comment, is the general theme"
10784,CANTO XX,"Of all our prayers: but when it darkens, then"
10785,CANTO XX,"A different strain we utter, then record"
10786,CANTO XX,"Pygmalion, whom his gluttonous thirst of gold"
10787,CANTO XX,"Made traitor, robber, parricide: the woes"
10788,CANTO XX,"Of Midas, which his greedy wish ensued,"
10789,CANTO XX,Mark’d for derision to all future times:
10790,CANTO XX,"And the fond Achan, how he stole the prey,"
10791,CANTO XX,That yet he seems by Joshua’s ire pursued.
10792,CANTO XX,"Sapphira with her husband next, we blame;"
10793,CANTO XX,"And praise the forefeet, that with furious ramp"
10794,CANTO XX,Spurn’d Heliodorus. All the mountain round
10795,CANTO XX,"Rings with the infamy of Thracia’s king,"
10796,CANTO XX,Who slew his Phrygian charge: and last a shout
10797,CANTO XX,"Ascends: “Declare, O Crassus! for thou know’st,"
10798,CANTO XX,The flavour of thy gold.” The voice of each
10799,CANTO XX,"Now high now low, as each his impulse prompts,"
10800,CANTO XX,"Is led through many a pitch, acute or grave."
10801,CANTO XX,"Therefore, not singly, I erewhile rehears’d"
10802,CANTO XX,That blessedness we tell of in the day:
10803,CANTO XX,But near me none beside his accent rais’d.”
10804,CANTO XX,
10805,CANTO XX,"From him we now had parted, and essay’d"
10806,CANTO XX,"With utmost efforts to surmount the way,"
10807,CANTO XX,"When I did feel, as nodding to its fall,"
10808,CANTO XX,The mountain tremble; whence an icy chill
10809,CANTO XX,"Seiz’d on me, as on one to death convey’d."
10810,CANTO XX,"So shook not Delos, when Latona there"
10811,CANTO XX,Couch’d to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.
10812,CANTO XX,
10813,CANTO XX,Forthwith from every side a shout arose
10814,CANTO XX,"So vehement, that suddenly my guide"
10815,CANTO XX,"Drew near, and cried: “Doubt not, while I conduct thee.”"
10816,CANTO XX,“Glory!” all shouted (such the sounds mine ear
10817,CANTO XX,"Gather’d from those, who near me swell’d the sounds)"
10818,CANTO XX,“Glory in the highest be to God.” We stood
10819,CANTO XX,"Immovably suspended, like to those,"
10820,CANTO XX,"The shepherds, who first heard in Bethlehem’s field"
10821,CANTO XX,"That song: till ceas’d the trembling, and the song"
10822,CANTO XX,"Was ended: then our hallow’d path resum’d,"
10823,CANTO XX,"Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew’d"
10824,CANTO XX,Their custom’d mourning. Never in my breast
10825,CANTO XX,Did ignorance so struggle with desire
10826,CANTO XX,"Of knowledge, if my memory do not err,"
10827,CANTO XX,As in that moment; nor through haste dar’d I
10828,CANTO XX,"To question, nor myself could aught discern,"
10829,CANTO XX,So on I far’d in thoughtfulness and dread.
10830,CANTO XX,
10831,CANTO XX,
10832,CANTO XX,
10833,CANTO XX,
10834,CANTO XXI,CANTO XXI
10835,CANTO XXI,
10836,CANTO XXI,
10837,CANTO XXI,"The natural thirst, ne’er quench’d but from the well,"
10838,CANTO XXI,"Whereof the woman of Samaria crav’d,"
10839,CANTO XXI,"Excited: haste along the cumber’d path,"
10840,CANTO XXI,"After my guide, impell’d; and pity mov’d"
10841,CANTO XXI,"My bosom for the ’vengeful deed, though just."
10842,CANTO XXI,"When lo! even as Luke relates, that Christ"
10843,CANTO XXI,"Appear’d unto the two upon their way,"
10844,CANTO XXI,New-risen from his vaulted grave; to us
10845,CANTO XXI,"A shade appear’d, and after us approach’d,"
10846,CANTO XXI,Contemplating the crowd beneath its feet.
10847,CANTO XXI,"We were not ware of it; so first it spake,"
10848,CANTO XXI,"Saying, “God give you peace, my brethren!” then"
10849,CANTO XXI,"Sudden we turn’d: and Virgil such salute,"
10850,CANTO XXI,"As fitted that kind greeting, gave, and cried:"
10851,CANTO XXI,“Peace in the blessed council be thy lot
10852,CANTO XXI,"Awarded by that righteous court, which me"
10853,CANTO XXI,To everlasting banishment exiles!”
10854,CANTO XXI,
10855,CANTO XXI,"“How!” he exclaim’d, nor from his speed meanwhile"
10856,CANTO XXI,"Desisting, “If that ye be spirits, whom God"
10857,CANTO XXI,"Vouchsafes not room above, who up the height"
10858,CANTO XXI,Has been thus far your guide?” To whom the bard:
10859,CANTO XXI,"“If thou observe the tokens, which this man"
10860,CANTO XXI,"Trac’d by the finger of the angel bears,"
10861,CANTO XXI,’Tis plain that in the kingdom of the just
10862,CANTO XXI,"He needs must share. But sithence she, whose wheel"
10863,CANTO XXI,"Spins day and night, for him not yet had drawn"
10864,CANTO XXI,"That yarn, which, on the fatal distaff pil’d,"
10865,CANTO XXI,"Clotho apportions to each wight that breathes,"
10866,CANTO XXI,"His soul, that sister is to mine and thine,"
10867,CANTO XXI,"Not of herself could mount, for not like ours"
10868,CANTO XXI,"Her ken: whence I, from forth the ample gulf"
10869,CANTO XXI,"Of hell was ta’en, to lead him, and will lead"
10870,CANTO XXI,"Far as my lore avails. But, if thou know,"
10871,CANTO XXI,"Instruct us for what cause, the mount erewhile"
10872,CANTO XXI,Thus shook and trembled: wherefore all at once
10873,CANTO XXI,"Seem’d shouting, even from his wave-wash’d foot.”"
10874,CANTO XXI,
10875,CANTO XXI,"That questioning so tallied with my wish,"
10876,CANTO XXI,The thirst did feel abatement of its edge
10877,CANTO XXI,"E’en from expectance. He forthwith replied,"
10878,CANTO XXI,“In its devotion nought irregular
10879,CANTO XXI,"This mount can witness, or by punctual rule"
10880,CANTO XXI,Unsanction’d; here from every change exempt.
10881,CANTO XXI,"Other than that, which heaven in itself"
10882,CANTO XXI,"Doth of itself receive, no influence"
10883,CANTO XXI,"Can reach us. Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,"
10884,CANTO XXI,"Hoar frost or dewy moistness, higher falls"
10885,CANTO XXI,Than that brief scale of threefold steps: thick clouds
10886,CANTO XXI,Nor scudding rack are ever seen: swift glance
10887,CANTO XXI,"Ne’er lightens, nor Thaumantian Iris gleams,"
10888,CANTO XXI,That yonder often shift on each side heav’n.
10889,CANTO XXI,Vapour adust doth never mount above
10890,CANTO XXI,"The highest of the trinal stairs, whereon"
10891,CANTO XXI,"Peter’s vicegerent stands. Lower perchance,"
10892,CANTO XXI,"With various motion rock’d, trembles the soil:"
10893,CANTO XXI,"But here, through wind in earth’s deep hollow pent,"
10894,CANTO XXI,"I know not how, yet never trembled: then"
10895,CANTO XXI,"Trembles, when any spirit feels itself"
10896,CANTO XXI,"So purified, that it may rise, or move"
10897,CANTO XXI,"For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues."
10898,CANTO XXI,Purification by the will alone
10899,CANTO XXI,"Is prov’d, that free to change society"
10900,CANTO XXI,Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.
10901,CANTO XXI,Desire of bliss is present from the first;
10902,CANTO XXI,"But strong propension hinders, to that wish"
10903,CANTO XXI,By the just ordinance of heav’n oppos’d;
10904,CANTO XXI,Propension now as eager to fulfil
10905,CANTO XXI,"Th’ allotted torment, as erewhile to sin."
10906,CANTO XXI,And I who in this punishment had lain
10907,CANTO XXI,"Five hundred years and more, but now have felt"
10908,CANTO XXI,Free wish for happier clime. Therefore thou felt’st
10909,CANTO XXI,"The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout"
10910,CANTO XXI,"Heard’st, over all his limits, utter praise"
10911,CANTO XXI,"To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy"
10912,CANTO XXI,To hasten.” Thus he spake: and since the draught
10913,CANTO XXI,"Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,"
10914,CANTO XXI,No words may speak my fullness of content.
10915,CANTO XXI,
10916,CANTO XXI,"“Now,” said the instructor sage, “I see the net"
10917,CANTO XXI,"That takes ye here, and how the toils are loos’d,"
10918,CANTO XXI,Why rocks the mountain and why ye rejoice.
10919,CANTO XXI,"Vouchsafe, that from thy lips I next may learn,"
10920,CANTO XXI,"Who on the earth thou wast, and wherefore here"
10921,CANTO XXI,"So many an age wert prostrate.”—“In that time,"
10922,CANTO XXI,"When the good Titus, with Heav’n’s King to help,"
10923,CANTO XXI,"Aveng’d those piteous gashes, whence the blood"
10924,CANTO XXI,"By Judas sold did issue, with the name"
10925,CANTO XXI,Most lasting and most honour’d there was I
10926,CANTO XXI,"Abundantly renown’d,” the shade reply’d,"
10927,CANTO XXI,“Not yet with faith endued. So passing sweet
10928,CANTO XXI,"My vocal Spirit, from Tolosa, Rome"
10929,CANTO XXI,"To herself drew me, where I merited"
10930,CANTO XXI,A myrtle garland to inwreathe my brow.
10931,CANTO XXI,"Statius they name me still. Of Thebes I sang,"
10932,CANTO XXI,And next of great Achilles: but i’ th’ way
10933,CANTO XXI,Fell with the second burthen. Of my flame
10934,CANTO XXI,"Those sparkles were the seeds, which I deriv’d"
10935,CANTO XXI,From the bright fountain of celestial fire
10936,CANTO XXI,"That feeds unnumber’d lamps, the song I mean"
10937,CANTO XXI,Which sounds Aeneas’ wand’rings: that the breast
10938,CANTO XXI,"I hung at, that the nurse, from whom my veins"
10939,CANTO XXI,Drank inspiration: whose authority
10940,CANTO XXI,Was ever sacred with me. To have liv’d
10941,CANTO XXI,"Coeval with the Mantuan, I would bide"
10942,CANTO XXI,The revolution of another sun
10943,CANTO XXI,Beyond my stated years in banishment.”
10944,CANTO XXI,
10945,CANTO XXI,"The Mantuan, when he heard him, turn’d to me,"
10946,CANTO XXI,And holding silence: by his countenance
10947,CANTO XXI,"Enjoin’d me silence but the power which wills,"
10948,CANTO XXI,Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears
10949,CANTO XXI,"Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,"
10950,CANTO XXI,They wait not for the motions of the will
10951,CANTO XXI,"In natures most sincere. I did but smile,"
10952,CANTO XXI,As one who winks; and thereupon the shade
10953,CANTO XXI,"Broke off, and peer’d into mine eyes, where best"
10954,CANTO XXI,Our looks interpret. “So to good event
10955,CANTO XXI,"Mayst thou conduct such great emprize,” he cried,"
10956,CANTO XXI,"“Say, why across thy visage beam’d, but now,"
10957,CANTO XXI,The lightning of a smile!” On either part
10958,CANTO XXI,"Now am I straiten’d; one conjures me speak,"
10959,CANTO XXI,Th’ other to silence binds me: whence a sigh
10960,CANTO XXI,"I utter, and the sigh is heard. “Speak on; “"
10961,CANTO XXI,"The teacher cried; “and do not fear to speak,"
10962,CANTO XXI,But tell him what so earnestly he asks.”
10963,CANTO XXI,"Whereon I thus: “Perchance, O ancient spirit!"
10964,CANTO XXI,Thou marvel’st at my smiling. There is room
10965,CANTO XXI,For yet more wonder. He who guides my ken
10966,CANTO XXI,"On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom"
10967,CANTO XXI,Thou didst presume of men arid gods to sing.
10968,CANTO XXI,"If other cause thou deem’dst for which I smil’d,"
10969,CANTO XXI,Leave it as not the true one; and believe
10970,CANTO XXI,"Those words, thou spak’st of him, indeed the cause.”"
10971,CANTO XXI,
10972,CANTO XXI,Now down he bent t’ embrace my teacher’s feet;
10973,CANTO XXI,But he forbade him: “Brother! do it not:
10974,CANTO XXI,"Thou art a shadow, and behold’st a shade.”"
10975,CANTO XXI,He rising answer’d thus: “Now hast thou prov’d
10976,CANTO XXI,"The force and ardour of the love I bear thee,"
10977,CANTO XXI,"When I forget we are but things of air,"
10978,CANTO XXI,And as a substance treat an empty shade.”
10979,CANTO XXI,
10980,CANTO XXI,
10981,CANTO XXI,
10982,CANTO XXI,
10983,CANTO XXII,CANTO XXII
10984,CANTO XXII,
10985,CANTO XXII,
10986,CANTO XXII,"Now we had left the angel, who had turn’d"
10987,CANTO XXII,"To the sixth circle our ascending step,"
10988,CANTO XXII,"One gash from off my forehead raz’d: while they,"
10989,CANTO XXII,"Whose wishes tend to justice, shouted forth:"
10990,CANTO XXII,"“Blessed!” and ended with, “I thirst:” and I,"
10991,CANTO XXII,"More nimble than along the other straits,"
10992,CANTO XXII,"So journey’d, that, without the sense of toil,"
10993,CANTO XXII,I follow’d upward the swift-footed shades;
10994,CANTO XXII,When Virgil thus began: “Let its pure flame
10995,CANTO XXII,"From virtue flow, and love can never fail"
10996,CANTO XXII,To warm another’s bosom’ so the light
10997,CANTO XXII,"Shine manifestly forth. Hence from that hour,"
10998,CANTO XXII,"When ’mongst us in the purlieus of the deep,"
10999,CANTO XXII,"Came down the spirit of Aquinum’s hard,"
11000,CANTO XXII,"Who told of thine affection, my good will"
11001,CANTO XXII,Hath been for thee of quality as strong
11002,CANTO XXII,As ever link’d itself to one not seen.
11003,CANTO XXII,Therefore these stairs will now seem short to me.
11004,CANTO XXII,But tell me: and if too secure I loose
11005,CANTO XXII,"The rein with a friend’s license, as a friend"
11006,CANTO XXII,"Forgive me, and speak now as with a friend:"
11007,CANTO XXII,How chanc’d it covetous desire could find
11008,CANTO XXII,"Place in that bosom, ’midst such ample store"
11009,CANTO XXII,"Of wisdom, as thy zeal had treasur’d there?”"
11010,CANTO XXII,
11011,CANTO XXII,"First somewhat mov’d to laughter by his words,"
11012,CANTO XXII,Statius replied: “Each syllable of thine
11013,CANTO XXII,Is a dear pledge of love. Things oft appear
11014,CANTO XXII,"That minister false matters to our doubts,"
11015,CANTO XXII,When their true causes are remov’d from sight.
11016,CANTO XXII,"Thy question doth assure me, thou believ’st"
11017,CANTO XXII,"I was on earth a covetous man, perhaps"
11018,CANTO XXII,Because thou found’st me in that circle plac’d.
11019,CANTO XXII,Know then I was too wide of avarice:
11020,CANTO XXII,"And e’en for that excess, thousands of moons"
11021,CANTO XXII,Have wax’d and wan’d upon my sufferings.
11022,CANTO XXII,And were it not that I with heedful care
11023,CANTO XXII,Noted where thou exclaim’st as if in ire
11024,CANTO XXII,"With human nature, ‘Why, thou cursed thirst"
11025,CANTO XXII,Of gold! dost not with juster measure guide
11026,CANTO XXII,The appetite of mortals?’ I had met
11027,CANTO XXII,The fierce encounter of the voluble rock.
11028,CANTO XXII,Then was I ware that with too ample wing
11029,CANTO XXII,"The hands may haste to lavishment, and turn’d,"
11030,CANTO XXII,"As from my other evil, so from this"
11031,CANTO XXII,In penitence. How many from their grave
11032,CANTO XXII,"Shall with shorn locks arise, who living, aye"
11033,CANTO XXII,"And at life’s last extreme, of this offence,"
11034,CANTO XXII,"Through ignorance, did not repent. And know,"
11035,CANTO XXII,The fault which lies direct from any sin
11036,CANTO XXII,"In level opposition, here With that"
11037,CANTO XXII,Wastes its green rankness on one common heap.
11038,CANTO XXII,"Therefore if I have been with those, who wail"
11039,CANTO XXII,"Their avarice, to cleanse me, through reverse"
11040,CANTO XXII,"Of their transgression, such hath been my lot.”"
11041,CANTO XXII,
11042,CANTO XXII,To whom the sovran of the pastoral song:
11043,CANTO XXII,“While thou didst sing that cruel warfare wag’d
11044,CANTO XXII,"By the twin sorrow of Jocasta’s womb,"
11045,CANTO XXII,"From thy discourse with Clio there, it seems"
11046,CANTO XXII,As faith had not been shine: without the which
11047,CANTO XXII,"Good deeds suffice not. And if so, what sun"
11048,CANTO XXII,"Rose on thee, or what candle pierc’d the dark"
11049,CANTO XXII,"That thou didst after see to hoist the sail,"
11050,CANTO XXII,"And follow, where the fisherman had led?”"
11051,CANTO XXII,
11052,CANTO XXII,"He answering thus: “By thee conducted first,"
11053,CANTO XXII,"I enter’d the Parnassian grots, and quaff’d"
11054,CANTO XXII,Of the clear spring; illumin’d first by thee
11055,CANTO XXII,"Open’d mine eyes to God. Thou didst, as one,"
11056,CANTO XXII,"Who, journeying through the darkness, hears a light"
11057,CANTO XXII,"Behind, that profits not himself, but makes"
11058,CANTO XXII,"His followers wise, when thou exclaimedst, ‘Lo!"
11059,CANTO XXII,A renovated world! Justice return’d!
11060,CANTO XXII,Times of primeval innocence restor’d!
11061,CANTO XXII,And a new race descended from above!’
11062,CANTO XXII,Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.
11063,CANTO XXII,"That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,"
11064,CANTO XXII,My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines
11065,CANTO XXII,"With livelier colouring. Soon o’er all the world,"
11066,CANTO XXII,"By messengers from heav’n, the true belief"
11067,CANTO XXII,"Teem’d now prolific, and that word of thine"
11068,CANTO XXII,"Accordant, to the new instructors chim’d."
11069,CANTO XXII,"Induc’d by which agreement, I was wont"
11070,CANTO XXII,Resort to them; and soon their sanctity
11071,CANTO XXII,"So won upon me, that, Domitian’s rage"
11072,CANTO XXII,"Pursuing them, I mix’d my tears with theirs,"
11073,CANTO XXII,"And, while on earth I stay’d, still succour’d them;"
11074,CANTO XXII,And their most righteous customs made me scorn
11075,CANTO XXII,All sects besides. Before I led the Greeks
11076,CANTO XXII,"In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,"
11077,CANTO XXII,"I was baptiz’d; but secretly, through fear,"
11078,CANTO XXII,"Remain’d a Christian, and conform’d long time"
11079,CANTO XXII,"To Pagan rites. Five centuries and more,"
11080,CANTO XXII,T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace
11081,CANTO XXII,"Round the fourth circle. Thou then, who hast rais’d"
11082,CANTO XXII,"The covering, which did hide such blessing from me,"
11083,CANTO XXII,"Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,"
11084,CANTO XXII,"Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,"
11085,CANTO XXII,"Caecilius, Plautus, Varro: if condemn’d"
11086,CANTO XXII,"They dwell, and in what province of the deep.”"
11087,CANTO XXII,"“These,” said my guide, “with Persius and myself,"
11088,CANTO XXII,"And others many more, are with that Greek,"
11089,CANTO XXII,"Of mortals, the most cherish’d by the Nine,"
11090,CANTO XXII,In the first ward of darkness. There ofttimes
11091,CANTO XXII,"We of that mount hold converse, on whose top"
11092,CANTO XXII,For aye our nurses live. We have the bard
11093,CANTO XXII,"Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,"
11094,CANTO XXII,"Simonides, and many a Grecian else"
11095,CANTO XXII,Ingarlanded with laurel. Of thy train
11096,CANTO XXII,"Antigone is there, Deiphile,"
11097,CANTO XXII,"Argia, and as sorrowful as erst"
11098,CANTO XXII,"Ismene, and who show’d Langia’s wave:"
11099,CANTO XXII,"Deidamia with her sisters there,"
11100,CANTO XXII,"And blind Tiresias’ daughter, and the bride"
11101,CANTO XXII,Sea-born of Peleus.” Either poet now
11102,CANTO XXII,"Was silent, and no longer by th’ ascent"
11103,CANTO XXII,"Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast"
11104,CANTO XXII,Inquiring eyes. Four handmaids of the day
11105,CANTO XXII,"Had finish’d now their office, and the fifth"
11106,CANTO XXII,"Was at the chariot-beam, directing still"
11107,CANTO XXII,"Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:"
11108,CANTO XXII,"“Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink"
11109,CANTO XXII,"Bend the right shoulder’ circuiting the mount,"
11110,CANTO XXII,As we have ever us’d.” So custom there
11111,CANTO XXII,"Was usher to the road, the which we chose"
11112,CANTO XXII,"Less doubtful, as that worthy shade complied."
11113,CANTO XXII,
11114,CANTO XXII,"They on before me went; I sole pursued,"
11115,CANTO XXII,"List’ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey’d"
11116,CANTO XXII,Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy.
11117,CANTO XXII,But soon they ceas’d; for midway of the road
11118,CANTO XXII,"A tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,"
11119,CANTO XXII,And pleasant to the smell: and as a fir
11120,CANTO XXII,"Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,"
11121,CANTO XXII,"So downward this less ample spread, that none."
11122,CANTO XXII,"Methinks, aloft may climb. Upon the side,"
11123,CANTO XXII,"That clos’d our path, a liquid crystal fell"
11124,CANTO XXII,"From the steep rock, and through the sprays above"
11125,CANTO XXII,Stream’d showering. With associate step the bards
11126,CANTO XXII,Drew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves
11127,CANTO XXII,A voice was heard: “Ye shall be chary of me;”
11128,CANTO XXII,And after added: “Mary took more thought
11129,CANTO XXII,"For joy and honour of the nuptial feast,"
11130,CANTO XXII,Than for herself who answers now for you.
11131,CANTO XXII,The women of old Rome were satisfied
11132,CANTO XXII,With water for their beverage. Daniel fed
11133,CANTO XXII,"On pulse, and wisdom gain’d. The primal age"
11134,CANTO XXII,Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then
11135,CANTO XXII,"Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet"
11136,CANTO XXII,"Run nectar. Honey and locusts were the food,"
11137,CANTO XXII,Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness
11138,CANTO XXII,"Fed, and that eminence of glory reach’d"
11139,CANTO XXII,"And greatness, which the’ Evangelist records.”"
11140,CANTO XXII,
11141,CANTO XXII,
11142,CANTO XXII,
11143,CANTO XXII,
11144,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
11145,CANTO XXIII,
11146,CANTO XXIII,
11147,CANTO XXIII,"On the green leaf mine eyes were fix’d, like his"
11148,CANTO XXIII,Who throws away his days in idle chase
11149,CANTO XXIII,"Of the diminutive, when thus I heard"
11150,CANTO XXIII,The more than father warn me: “Son! our time
11151,CANTO XXIII,Asks thriftier using. Linger not: away.”
11152,CANTO XXIII,
11153,CANTO XXIII,Thereat my face and steps at once I turn’d
11154,CANTO XXIII,"Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer’d"
11155,CANTO XXIII,"I journey’d on, and felt no toil: and lo!"
11156,CANTO XXIII,"A sound of weeping and a song: “My lips,"
11157,CANTO XXIII,"O Lord!” and these so mingled, it gave birth"
11158,CANTO XXIII,"To pleasure and to pain. “O Sire, belov’d!"
11159,CANTO XXIII,Say what is this I hear?” Thus I inquir’d.
11160,CANTO XXIII,
11161,CANTO XXIII,"“Spirits,” said he, “who as they go, perchance,"
11162,CANTO XXIII,Their debt of duty pay.” As on their road
11163,CANTO XXIII,"The thoughtful pilgrims, overtaking some"
11164,CANTO XXIII,"Not known unto them, turn to them, and look,"
11165,CANTO XXIII,"But stay not; thus, approaching from behind"
11166,CANTO XXIII,"With speedier motion, eyed us, as they pass’d,"
11167,CANTO XXIII,"A crowd of spirits, silent and devout."
11168,CANTO XXIII,The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale
11169,CANTO XXIII,"Their visage, and so lean withal, the bones"
11170,CANTO XXIII,Stood staring thro’ the skin. I do not think
11171,CANTO XXIII,"Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show’d,"
11172,CANTO XXIII,When pinc’ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.
11173,CANTO XXIII,
11174,CANTO XXIII,"“Lo!” to myself I mus’d, “the race, who lost"
11175,CANTO XXIII,"Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak"
11176,CANTO XXIII,"Prey’d on her child.” The sockets seem’d as rings,"
11177,CANTO XXIII,From which the gems were drops. Who reads the name
11178,CANTO XXIII,"Of man upon his forehead, there the M"
11179,CANTO XXIII,"Had trac’d most plainly. Who would deem, that scent"
11180,CANTO XXIII,"Of water and an apple, could have prov’d"
11181,CANTO XXIII,"Powerful to generate such pining want,"
11182,CANTO XXIII,Not knowing how it wrought? While now I stood
11183,CANTO XXIII,Wond’ring what thus could waste them (for the cause
11184,CANTO XXIII,Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind
11185,CANTO XXIII,Appear’d not) lo! a spirit turn’d his eyes
11186,CANTO XXIII,"In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten’d then"
11187,CANTO XXIII,"On me, then cried with vehemence aloud:"
11188,CANTO XXIII,“What grace is this vouchsaf’d me?” By his looks
11189,CANTO XXIII,I ne’er had recogniz’d him: but the voice
11190,CANTO XXIII,Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal’d.
11191,CANTO XXIII,Remembrance of his alter’d lineaments
11192,CANTO XXIII,Was kindled from that spark; and I agniz’d
11193,CANTO XXIII,The visage of Forese. “Ah! respect
11194,CANTO XXIII,"This wan and leprous wither’d skin,” thus he"
11195,CANTO XXIII,"Suppliant implor’d, “this macerated flesh."
11196,CANTO XXIII,Speak to me truly of thyself. And who
11197,CANTO XXIII,"Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there?"
11198,CANTO XXIII,Be it not said thou Scorn’st to talk with me.”
11199,CANTO XXIII,
11200,CANTO XXIII,"“That face of thine,” I answer’d him, “which dead"
11201,CANTO XXIII,"I once bewail’d, disposes me not less"
11202,CANTO XXIII,"For weeping, when I see It thus transform’d."
11203,CANTO XXIII,"Say then, by Heav’n, what blasts ye thus? The whilst"
11204,CANTO XXIII,"I wonder, ask not Speech from me: unapt"
11205,CANTO XXIII,"Is he to speak, whom other will employs."
11206,CANTO XXIII,
11207,CANTO XXIII,"He thus: “The water and tee plant we pass’d,"
11208,CANTO XXIII,"Virtue possesses, by th’ eternal will"
11209,CANTO XXIII,"Infus’d, the which so pines me. Every spirit,"
11210,CANTO XXIII,Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg’d
11211,CANTO XXIII,"Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst"
11212,CANTO XXIII,"Is purified. The odour, which the fruit,"
11213,CANTO XXIII,"And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,"
11214,CANTO XXIII,Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.
11215,CANTO XXIII,Nor once alone encompassing our route
11216,CANTO XXIII,We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:
11217,CANTO XXIII,"Pain, said I? solace rather: for that will"
11218,CANTO XXIII,"To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led"
11219,CANTO XXIII,"To call Elias, joyful when he paid"
11220,CANTO XXIII,Our ransom from his vein.” I answering thus:
11221,CANTO XXIII,"“Forese! from that day, in which the world"
11222,CANTO XXIII,"For better life thou changedst, not five years"
11223,CANTO XXIII,Have circled. If the power of sinning more
11224,CANTO XXIII,"Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew’st"
11225,CANTO XXIII,"That kindly grief, which re-espouses us"
11226,CANTO XXIII,"To God, how hither art thou come so soon?"
11227,CANTO XXIII,"I thought to find thee lower, there, where time"
11228,CANTO XXIII,Is recompense for time.” He straight replied:
11229,CANTO XXIII,“To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction
11230,CANTO XXIII,I have been brought thus early by the tears
11231,CANTO XXIII,"Stream’d down my Nella’s cheeks. Her prayers devout,"
11232,CANTO XXIII,"Her sighs have drawn me from the coast, where oft"
11233,CANTO XXIII,"Expectance lingers, and have set me free"
11234,CANTO XXIII,From th’ other circles. In the sight of God
11235,CANTO XXIII,"So much the dearer is my widow priz’d,"
11236,CANTO XXIII,"She whom I lov’d so fondly, as she ranks"
11237,CANTO XXIII,More singly eminent for virtuous deeds.
11238,CANTO XXIII,"The tract most barb’rous of Sardinia’s isle,"
11239,CANTO XXIII,Hath dames more chaste and modester by far
11240,CANTO XXIII,Than that wherein I left her. O sweet brother!
11241,CANTO XXIII,What wouldst thou have me say? A time to come
11242,CANTO XXIII,"Stands full within my view, to which this hour"
11243,CANTO XXIII,"Shall not be counted of an ancient date,"
11244,CANTO XXIII,When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn’d
11245,CANTO XXIII,"Th’ unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare"
11246,CANTO XXIII,Unkerchief’d bosoms to the common gaze.
11247,CANTO XXIII,"What savage women hath the world e’er seen,"
11248,CANTO XXIII,"What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge"
11249,CANTO XXIII,"Of spiritual or other discipline,"
11250,CANTO XXIII,To force them walk with cov’ring on their limbs!
11251,CANTO XXIII,"But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav’n"
11252,CANTO XXIII,"Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,"
11253,CANTO XXIII,Their mouths were op’d for howling: they shall taste
11254,CANTO XXIII,Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)
11255,CANTO XXIII,Or ere the cheek of him be cloth’d with down
11256,CANTO XXIII,Who is now rock’d with lullaby asleep.
11257,CANTO XXIII,"Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,"
11258,CANTO XXIII,Thou seest how not I alone but all
11259,CANTO XXIII,"Gaze, where thou veil’st the intercepted sun.”"
11260,CANTO XXIII,
11261,CANTO XXIII,Whence I replied: “If thou recall to mind
11262,CANTO XXIII,"What we were once together, even yet"
11263,CANTO XXIII,Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.
11264,CANTO XXIII,"That I forsook that life, was due to him"
11265,CANTO XXIII,"Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,"
11266,CANTO XXIII,"When she was round, who shines with sister lamp"
11267,CANTO XXIII,"To his, that glisters yonder,” and I show’d"
11268,CANTO XXIII,"The sun. “Tis he, who through profoundest night"
11269,CANTO XXIII,"Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh"
11270,CANTO XXIII,"As true, that follows. From that gloom the aid"
11271,CANTO XXIII,"Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb,"
11272,CANTO XXIII,"And climbing wind along this mountain-steep,"
11273,CANTO XXIII,Which rectifies in you whate’er the world
11274,CANTO XXIII,"Made crooked and deprav’d I have his word,"
11275,CANTO XXIII,That he will bear me company as far
11276,CANTO XXIII,As till I come where Beatrice dwells:
11277,CANTO XXIII,"But there must leave me. Virgil is that spirit,"
11278,CANTO XXIII,"Who thus hath promis’d,” and I pointed to him;"
11279,CANTO XXIII,"“The other is that shade, for whom so late"
11280,CANTO XXIII,"Your realm, as he arose, exulting shook"
11281,CANTO XXIII,Through every pendent cliff and rocky bound.”
11282,CANTO XXIII,
11283,CANTO XXIII,
11284,CANTO XXIII,
11285,CANTO XXIII,
11286,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
11287,CANTO XXIV,
11288,CANTO XXIV,
11289,CANTO XXIV,"Our journey was not slacken’d by our talk,"
11290,CANTO XXIV,"Nor yet our talk by journeying. Still we spake,"
11291,CANTO XXIV,"And urg’d our travel stoutly, like a ship"
11292,CANTO XXIV,"When the wind sits astern. The shadowy forms,"
11293,CANTO XXIV,"That seem’d things dead and dead again, drew in"
11294,CANTO XXIV,"At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,"
11295,CANTO XXIV,Perceiving I had life; and I my words
11296,CANTO XXIV,"Continued, and thus spake; “He journeys up"
11297,CANTO XXIV,"Perhaps more tardily then else he would,"
11298,CANTO XXIV,"For others’ sake. But tell me, if thou know’st,"
11299,CANTO XXIV,"Where is Piccarda? Tell me, if I see"
11300,CANTO XXIV,"Any of mark, among this multitude,"
11301,CANTO XXIV,"Who eye me thus.”—“My sister (she for whom,"
11302,CANTO XXIV,’Twixt beautiful and good I cannot say
11303,CANTO XXIV,"Which name was fitter) wears e’en now her crown,"
11304,CANTO XXIV,"And triumphs in Olympus.” Saying this,"
11305,CANTO XXIV,He added: “Since spare diet hath so worn
11306,CANTO XXIV,"Our semblance out, ’tis lawful here to name"
11307,CANTO XXIV,"Each one . This,” and his finger then he rais’d,"
11308,CANTO XXIV,"“Is Buonaggiuna,—Buonaggiuna, he"
11309,CANTO XXIV,"Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc’d"
11310,CANTO XXIV,"Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,"
11311,CANTO XXIV,"Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,"
11312,CANTO XXIV,And purges by wan abstinence away
11313,CANTO XXIV,Bolsena’s eels and cups of muscadel.”
11314,CANTO XXIV,
11315,CANTO XXIV,"He show’d me many others, one by one,"
11316,CANTO XXIV,"And all, as they were nam’d, seem’d well content;"
11317,CANTO XXIV,For no dark gesture I discern’d in any.
11318,CANTO XXIV,I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind
11319,CANTO XXIV,"His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,"
11320,CANTO XXIV,That wav’d the crozier o’er a num’rous flock.
11321,CANTO XXIV,"I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile"
11322,CANTO XXIV,"To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so"
11323,CANTO XXIV,"Was one ne’er sated. I howe’er, like him,"
11324,CANTO XXIV,"That gazing ’midst a crowd, singles out one,"
11325,CANTO XXIV,So singled him of Lucca; for methought
11326,CANTO XXIV,Was none amongst them took such note of me.
11327,CANTO XXIV,Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:
11328,CANTO XXIV,"The sound was indistinct, and murmur’d there,"
11329,CANTO XXIV,"Where justice, that so strips them, fix’d her sting."
11330,CANTO XXIV,
11331,CANTO XXIV,"“Spirit!” said I, “it seems as thou wouldst fain"
11332,CANTO XXIV,Speak with me. Let me hear thee. Mutual wish
11333,CANTO XXIV,"To converse prompts, which let us both indulge.”"
11334,CANTO XXIV,
11335,CANTO XXIV,"He, answ’ring, straight began: “Woman is born,"
11336,CANTO XXIV,"Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make"
11337,CANTO XXIV,"My city please thee, blame it as they may."
11338,CANTO XXIV,Go then with this forewarning. If aught false
11339,CANTO XXIV,"My whisper too implied, th’ event shall tell"
11340,CANTO XXIV,"But say, if of a truth I see the man"
11341,CANTO XXIV,"Of that new lay th’ inventor, which begins"
11342,CANTO XXIV,"With ‘Ladies, ye that con the lore of love’.”"
11343,CANTO XXIV,
11344,CANTO XXIV,To whom I thus: “Count of me but as one
11345,CANTO XXIV,"Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,"
11346,CANTO XXIV,"Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.”"
11347,CANTO XXIV,
11348,CANTO XXIV,"“Brother!” said he, “the hind’rance which once held"
11349,CANTO XXIV,"The notary with Guittone and myself,"
11350,CANTO XXIV,"Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,"
11351,CANTO XXIV,Is now disclos’d. I see how ye your plumes
11352,CANTO XXIV,"Stretch, as th’ inditer guides them; which, no question,"
11353,CANTO XXIV,"Ours did not. He that seeks a grace beyond,"
11354,CANTO XXIV,Sees not the distance parts one style from other.”
11355,CANTO XXIV,"And, as contented, here he held his peace."
11356,CANTO XXIV,
11357,CANTO XXIV,"Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,"
11358,CANTO XXIV,"In squared regiment direct their course,"
11359,CANTO XXIV,Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;
11360,CANTO XXIV,"Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn’d"
11361,CANTO XXIV,"Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike"
11362,CANTO XXIV,"Through leanness and desire. And as a man,"
11363,CANTO XXIV,"Tir’d With the motion of a trotting steed,"
11364,CANTO XXIV,"Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,"
11365,CANTO XXIV,Till his o’erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;
11366,CANTO XXIV,E’en so Forese let that holy crew
11367,CANTO XXIV,"Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,"
11368,CANTO XXIV,And saying: “When shall I again behold thee?”
11369,CANTO XXIV,
11370,CANTO XXIV,"“How long my life may last,” said I, “I know not;"
11371,CANTO XXIV,"This know, how soon soever I return,"
11372,CANTO XXIV,My wishes will before me have arriv’d.
11373,CANTO XXIV,"Sithence the place, where I am set to live,"
11374,CANTO XXIV,"Is, day by day, more scoop’d of all its good,"
11375,CANTO XXIV,And dismal ruin seems to threaten it.”
11376,CANTO XXIV,
11377,CANTO XXIV,"“Go now,” he cried: “lo! he, whose guilt is most,"
11378,CANTO XXIV,"Passes before my vision, dragg’d at heels"
11379,CANTO XXIV,"Of an infuriate beast. Toward the vale,"
11380,CANTO XXIV,"Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,"
11381,CANTO XXIV,Each step increasing swiftness on the last;
11382,CANTO XXIV,"Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him"
11383,CANTO XXIV,A corse most vilely shatter’d. No long space
11384,CANTO XXIV,Those wheels have yet to roll” (therewith his eyes
11385,CANTO XXIV,Look’d up to heav’n) “ere thou shalt plainly see
11386,CANTO XXIV,That which my words may not more plainly tell.
11387,CANTO XXIV,I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose
11388,CANTO XXIV,"Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine.”"
11389,CANTO XXIV,
11390,CANTO XXIV,As from a troop of well-rank’d chivalry
11391,CANTO XXIV,"One knight, more enterprising than the rest,"
11392,CANTO XXIV,"Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display"
11393,CANTO XXIV,His prowess in the first encounter prov’d
11394,CANTO XXIV,"So parted he from us with lengthen’d strides,"
11395,CANTO XXIV,"And left me on the way with those twain spirits,"
11396,CANTO XXIV,Who were such mighty marshals of the world.
11397,CANTO XXIV,
11398,CANTO XXIV,When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes
11399,CANTO XXIV,"No nearer reach’d him, than my thought his words,"
11400,CANTO XXIV,"The branches of another fruit, thick hung,"
11401,CANTO XXIV,"And blooming fresh, appear’d. E’en as our steps"
11402,CANTO XXIV,"Turn’d thither, not far off it rose to view."
11403,CANTO XXIV,"Beneath it were a multitude, that rais’d"
11404,CANTO XXIV,"Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What"
11405,CANTO XXIV,"Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,"
11406,CANTO XXIV,"That beg, and answer none obtain from him,"
11407,CANTO XXIV,"Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,"
11408,CANTO XXIV,He at arm’s length the object of their wish
11409,CANTO XXIV,"Above them holds aloft, and hides it not."
11410,CANTO XXIV,
11411,CANTO XXIV,"At length, as undeceiv’d they went their way:"
11412,CANTO XXIV,"And we approach the tree, who vows and tears"
11413,CANTO XXIV,"Sue to in vain, the mighty tree. “Pass on,"
11414,CANTO XXIV,"And come not near. Stands higher up the wood,"
11415,CANTO XXIV,"Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta’en"
11416,CANTO XXIV,‘this plant.” Such sounds from midst the thickets came.
11417,CANTO XXIV,"Whence I, with either bard, close to the side"
11418,CANTO XXIV,"That rose, pass’d forth beyond. “Remember,” next"
11419,CANTO XXIV,"We heard, “those noblest creatures of the clouds,"
11420,CANTO XXIV,How they their twofold bosoms overgorg’d
11421,CANTO XXIV,Oppos’d in fight to Theseus: call to mind
11422,CANTO XXIV,"The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop’d"
11423,CANTO XXIV,"To ease their thirst; whence Gideon’s ranks were thinn’d,"
11424,CANTO XXIV,As he to Midian march’d adown the hills.”
11425,CANTO XXIV,
11426,CANTO XXIV,"Thus near one border coasting, still we heard"
11427,CANTO XXIV,"The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile"
11428,CANTO XXIV,"Reguerdon’d. Then along the lonely path,"
11429,CANTO XXIV,"Once more at large, full thousand paces on"
11430,CANTO XXIV,"We travel’d, each contemplative and mute."
11431,CANTO XXIV,
11432,CANTO XXIV,“Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?”
11433,CANTO XXIV,Thus suddenly a voice exclaim’d: whereat
11434,CANTO XXIV,"I shook, as doth a scar’d and paltry beast;"
11435,CANTO XXIV,Then rais’d my head to look from whence it came.
11436,CANTO XXIV,
11437,CANTO XXIV,"Was ne’er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen"
11438,CANTO XXIV,"So bright and glowing red, as was the shape"
11439,CANTO XXIV,"I now beheld. “If ye desire to mount,”"
11440,CANTO XXIV,"He cried, “here must ye turn. This way he goes,"
11441,CANTO XXIV,Who goes in quest of peace.” His countenance
11442,CANTO XXIV,Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac’d
11443,CANTO XXIV,"Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs."
11444,CANTO XXIV,
11445,CANTO XXIV,"As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up"
11446,CANTO XXIV,"On freshen’d wing the air of May, and breathes"
11447,CANTO XXIV,"Of fragrance, all impregn’d with herb and flowers,"
11448,CANTO XXIV,E’en such a wind I felt upon my front
11449,CANTO XXIV,"Blow gently, and the moving of a wing"
11450,CANTO XXIV,"Perceiv’d, that moving shed ambrosial smell;"
11451,CANTO XXIV,"And then a voice: “Blessed are they, whom grace"
11452,CANTO XXIV,"Doth so illume, that appetite in them"
11453,CANTO XXIV,"Exhaleth no inordinate desire,"
11454,CANTO XXIV,Still hung’ring as the rule of temperance wills.”
11455,CANTO XXIV,
11456,CANTO XXIV,
11457,CANTO XXIV,
11458,CANTO XXIV,
11459,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
11460,CANTO XXV,
11461,CANTO XXV,
11462,CANTO XXV,"It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need"
11463,CANTO XXV,To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now
11464,CANTO XXV,"To Taurus the meridian circle left,"
11465,CANTO XXV,And to the Scorpion left the night. As one
11466,CANTO XXV,"That makes no pause, but presses on his road,"
11467,CANTO XXV,"Whate’er betide him, if some urgent need"
11468,CANTO XXV,"Impel: so enter’d we upon our way,"
11469,CANTO XXV,"One before other; for, but singly, none"
11470,CANTO XXV,That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.
11471,CANTO XXV,
11472,CANTO XXV,E’en as the young stork lifteth up his wing
11473,CANTO XXV,"Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit"
11474,CANTO XXV,"The nest, and drops it; so in me desire"
11475,CANTO XXV,"Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,"
11476,CANTO XXV,"Arriving even to the act, that marks"
11477,CANTO XXV,A man prepar’d for speech. Him all our haste
11478,CANTO XXV,"Restrain’d not, but thus spake the sire belov’d:"
11479,CANTO XXV,"Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip"
11480,CANTO XXV,Stands trembling for its flight.” Encourag’d thus
11481,CANTO XXV,"I straight began: “How there can leanness come,"
11482,CANTO XXV,Where is no want of nourishment to feed?”
11483,CANTO XXV,
11484,CANTO XXV,"“If thou,” he answer’d, “hadst remember’d thee,"
11485,CANTO XXV,How Meleager with the wasting brand
11486,CANTO XXV,"Wasted alike, by equal fires consm’d,"
11487,CANTO XXV,"This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,"
11488,CANTO XXV,How in the mirror your reflected form
11489,CANTO XXV,"With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems"
11490,CANTO XXV,"Hard, had appear’d no harder than the pulp"
11491,CANTO XXV,Of summer fruit mature. But that thy will
11492,CANTO XXV,"In certainty may find its full repose,"
11493,CANTO XXV,"Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray"
11494,CANTO XXV,That he would now be healer of thy wound.”
11495,CANTO XXV,
11496,CANTO XXV,“If in thy presence I unfold to him
11497,CANTO XXV,"The secrets of heaven’s vengeance, let me plead"
11498,CANTO XXV,"Thine own injunction, to exculpate me.”"
11499,CANTO XXV,"So Statius answer’d, and forthwith began:"
11500,CANTO XXV,"“Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind"
11501,CANTO XXV,Receive them: so shall they be light to clear
11502,CANTO XXV,"The doubt thou offer’st. Blood, concocted well,"
11503,CANTO XXV,"Which by the thirsty veins is ne’er imbib’d,"
11504,CANTO XXV,"And rests as food superfluous, to be ta’en"
11505,CANTO XXV,"From the replenish’d table, in the heart"
11506,CANTO XXV,"Derives effectual virtue, that informs"
11507,CANTO XXV,"The several human limbs, as being that,"
11508,CANTO XXV,Which passes through the veins itself to make them.
11509,CANTO XXV,"Yet more concocted it descends, where shame"
11510,CANTO XXV,Forbids to mention: and from thence distils
11511,CANTO XXV,In natural vessel on another’s blood.
11512,CANTO XXV,"Then each unite together, one dispos’d"
11513,CANTO XXV,"T’ endure, to act the other, through meet frame"
11514,CANTO XXV,"Of its recipient mould: that being reach’d,"
11515,CANTO XXV,"It ’gins to work, coagulating first;"
11516,CANTO XXV,Then vivifies what its own substance caus’d
11517,CANTO XXV,"To bear. With animation now indued,"
11518,CANTO XXV,The active virtue (differing from a plant
11519,CANTO XXV,"No further, than that this is on the way"
11520,CANTO XXV,And at its limit that) continues yet
11521,CANTO XXV,"To operate, that now it moves, and feels,"
11522,CANTO XXV,As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there
11523,CANTO XXV,Assumes th’ organic powers its seed convey’d.
11524,CANTO XXV,"‘This is the period, son! at which the virtue,"
11525,CANTO XXV,"That from the generating heart proceeds,"
11526,CANTO XXV,Is pliant and expansive; for each limb
11527,CANTO XXV,Is in the heart by forgeful nature plann’d.
11528,CANTO XXV,"How babe of animal becomes, remains"
11529,CANTO XXV,"For thy consid’ring. At this point, more wise,"
11530,CANTO XXV,"Than thou hast err’d, making the soul disjoin’d"
11531,CANTO XXV,"From passive intellect, because he saw"
11532,CANTO XXV,No organ for the latter’s use assign’d.
11533,CANTO XXV,
11534,CANTO XXV,“Open thy bosom to the truth that comes.
11535,CANTO XXV,"Know soon as in the embryo, to the brain,"
11536,CANTO XXV,"Articulation is complete, then turns"
11537,CANTO XXV,The primal Mover with a smile of joy
11538,CANTO XXV,"On such great work of nature, and imbreathes"
11539,CANTO XXV,"New spirit replete with virtue, that what here"
11540,CANTO XXV,"Active it finds, to its own substance draws,"
11541,CANTO XXV,"And forms an individual soul, that lives,"
11542,CANTO XXV,"And feels, and bends reflective on itself."
11543,CANTO XXV,"And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,"
11544,CANTO XXV,"Mark the sun’s heat, how that to wine doth change,"
11545,CANTO XXV,Mix’d with the moisture filter’d through the vine.
11546,CANTO XXV,
11547,CANTO XXV,"“When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul"
11548,CANTO XXV,"Takes with her both the human and divine,"
11549,CANTO XXV,"Memory, intelligence, and will, in act"
11550,CANTO XXV,"Far keener than before, the other powers"
11551,CANTO XXV,"Inactive all and mute. No pause allow’d,"
11552,CANTO XXV,"In wond’rous sort self-moving, to one strand"
11553,CANTO XXV,"Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,"
11554,CANTO XXV,Here learns her destin’d path. Soon as the place
11555,CANTO XXV,"Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,"
11556,CANTO XXV,Distinct as in the living limbs before:
11557,CANTO XXV,"And as the air, when saturate with showers,"
11558,CANTO XXV,"The casual beam refracting, decks itself"
11559,CANTO XXV,With many a hue; so here the ambient air
11560,CANTO XXV,"Weareth that form, which influence of the soul"
11561,CANTO XXV,"Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where"
11562,CANTO XXV,"The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth"
11563,CANTO XXV,The new form on the spirit follows still:
11564,CANTO XXV,"Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call’d,"
11565,CANTO XXV,With each sense even to the sight endued:
11566,CANTO XXV,"Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs"
11567,CANTO XXV,Which thou mayst oft have witness’d on the mount
11568,CANTO XXV,Th’ obedient shadow fails not to present
11569,CANTO XXV,Whatever varying passion moves within us.
11570,CANTO XXV,And this the cause of what thou marvel’st at.”
11571,CANTO XXV,
11572,CANTO XXV,"Now the last flexure of our way we reach’d,"
11573,CANTO XXV,"And to the right hand turning, other care"
11574,CANTO XXV,Awaits us. Here the rocky precipice
11575,CANTO XXV,"Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim"
11576,CANTO XXV,"A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff"
11577,CANTO XXV,"Driveth them back, sequester’d from its bound."
11578,CANTO XXV,
11579,CANTO XXV,"Behoov’d us, one by one, along the side,"
11580,CANTO XXV,"That border’d on the void, to pass; and I"
11581,CANTO XXV,"Fear’d on one hand the fire, on th’ other fear’d"
11582,CANTO XXV,Headlong to fall: when thus th’ instructor warn’d:
11583,CANTO XXV,“Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.
11584,CANTO XXV,A little swerving and the way is lost.”
11585,CANTO XXV,
11586,CANTO XXV,"Then from the bosom of the burning mass,"
11587,CANTO XXV,“O God of mercy!” heard I sung; and felt
11588,CANTO XXV,No less desire to turn. And when I saw
11589,CANTO XXV,"Spirits along the flame proceeding, I"
11590,CANTO XXV,Between their footsteps and mine own was fain
11591,CANTO XXV,To share by turns my view. At the hymn’s close
11592,CANTO XXV,"They shouted loud, “I do not know a man;”"
11593,CANTO XXV,"Then in low voice again took up the strain,"
11594,CANTO XXV,"Which once more ended, “To the wood,” they cried,"
11595,CANTO XXV,"“Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung"
11596,CANTO XXV,With Cytherea’s poison:” then return’d
11597,CANTO XXV,"Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll’d,"
11598,CANTO XXV,"Who liv’d in virtue chastely, and the bands"
11599,CANTO XXV,"Of wedded love. Nor from that task, I ween,"
11600,CANTO XXV,Surcease they; whilesoe’er the scorching fire
11601,CANTO XXV,Enclasps them. Of such skill appliance needs
11602,CANTO XXV,"To medicine the wound, that healeth last."
11603,CANTO XXV,
11604,CANTO XXV,
11605,CANTO XXV,
11606,CANTO XXV,
11607,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
11608,CANTO XXVI,
11609,CANTO XXVI,
11610,CANTO XXVI,"While singly thus along the rim we walk’d,"
11611,CANTO XXVI,Oft the good master warn’d me: “Look thou well.
11612,CANTO XXVI,Avail it that I caution thee.” The sun
11613,CANTO XXVI,Now all the western clime irradiate chang’d
11614,CANTO XXVI,"From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass’d,"
11615,CANTO XXVI,My passing shadow made the umber’d flame
11616,CANTO XXVI,Burn ruddier. At so strange a sight I mark’d
11617,CANTO XXVI,That many a spirit marvel’d on his way.
11618,CANTO XXVI,
11619,CANTO XXVI,"This bred occasion first to speak of me,"
11620,CANTO XXVI,"“He seems,” said they, “no insubstantial frame:”"
11621,CANTO XXVI,"Then to obtain what certainty they might,"
11622,CANTO XXVI,"Stretch’d towards me, careful not to overpass"
11623,CANTO XXVI,"The burning pale. “O thou, who followest"
11624,CANTO XXVI,"The others, haply not more slow than they,"
11625,CANTO XXVI,"But mov’d by rev’rence, answer me, who burn"
11626,CANTO XXVI,"In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these"
11627,CANTO XXVI,"All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth"
11628,CANTO XXVI,Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.
11629,CANTO XXVI,"Tell us, how is it that thou mak’st thyself"
11630,CANTO XXVI,"A wall against the sun, as thou not yet"
11631,CANTO XXVI,Into th’ inextricable toils of death
11632,CANTO XXVI,"Hadst enter’d?” Thus spake one, and I had straight"
11633,CANTO XXVI,"Declar’d me, if attention had not turn’d"
11634,CANTO XXVI,"To new appearance. Meeting these, there came,"
11635,CANTO XXVI,"Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom"
11636,CANTO XXVI,"Earnestly gazing, from each part I view"
11637,CANTO XXVI,"The shadows all press forward, sev’rally"
11638,CANTO XXVI,"Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away."
11639,CANTO XXVI,"E’en so the emmets, ’mid their dusky troops,"
11640,CANTO XXVI,"Peer closely one at other, to spy out"
11641,CANTO XXVI,"Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive."
11642,CANTO XXVI,
11643,CANTO XXVI,"That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch"
11644,CANTO XXVI,"Of the first onward step, from either tribe"
11645,CANTO XXVI,"Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,"
11646,CANTO XXVI,"Shout Sodom and Gomorrah!” these, “The cow"
11647,CANTO XXVI,"Pasiphae enter’d, that the beast she woo’d"
11648,CANTO XXVI,"Might rush unto her luxury.” Then as cranes,"
11649,CANTO XXVI,"That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,"
11650,CANTO XXVI,"Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid"
11651,CANTO XXVI,"The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off"
11652,CANTO XXVI,"One crowd, advances th’ other; and resume"
11653,CANTO XXVI,"Their first song weeping, and their several shout."
11654,CANTO XXVI,
11655,CANTO XXVI,"Again drew near my side the very same,"
11656,CANTO XXVI,"Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks"
11657,CANTO XXVI,"Mark’d eagerness to listen. I, who twice"
11658,CANTO XXVI,"Their will had noted, spake: “O spirits secure,"
11659,CANTO XXVI,"Whene’er the time may be, of peaceful end!"
11660,CANTO XXVI,"My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,"
11661,CANTO XXVI,"Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed"
11662,CANTO XXVI,"With blood, and sinew-strung. That I no more"
11663,CANTO XXVI,"May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft."
11664,CANTO XXVI,"There is a dame on high, who wind for us"
11665,CANTO XXVI,"This grace, by which my mortal through your realm"
11666,CANTO XXVI,I bear. But may your utmost wish soon meet
11667,CANTO XXVI,"Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,"
11668,CANTO XXVI,"Fullest of love, and of most ample space,"
11669,CANTO XXVI,"Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page"
11670,CANTO XXVI,"Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,"
11671,CANTO XXVI,"And what this multitude, that at your backs"
11672,CANTO XXVI,"Have past behind us.” As one, mountain-bred,"
11673,CANTO XXVI,"Rugged and clownish, if some city’s walls"
11674,CANTO XXVI,"He chance to enter, round him stares agape,"
11675,CANTO XXVI,Confounded and struck dumb; e’en such appear’d
11676,CANTO XXVI,"Each spirit. But when rid of that amaze,"
11677,CANTO XXVI,(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)
11678,CANTO XXVI,"He, who before had question’d, thus resum’d:"
11679,CANTO XXVI,"“O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak’st"
11680,CANTO XXVI,"Experience of our limits, in thy bark!"
11681,CANTO XXVI,"Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,"
11682,CANTO XXVI,"For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard"
11683,CANTO XXVI,"The snout of ‘queen,’ to taunt him. Hence their cry"
11684,CANTO XXVI,"Of ‘Sodom,’ as they parted, to rebuke"
11685,CANTO XXVI,"Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame."
11686,CANTO XXVI,"Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,"
11687,CANTO XXVI,"Because the law of human kind we broke,"
11688,CANTO XXVI,"Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,"
11689,CANTO XXVI,"Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace"
11690,CANTO XXVI,"Record the name of her, by whom the beast"
11691,CANTO XXVI,In bestial tire was acted. Now our deeds
11692,CANTO XXVI,"Thou know’st, and how we sinn’d. If thou by name"
11693,CANTO XXVI,"Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now"
11694,CANTO XXVI,"To tell so much, nor can I. Of myself"
11695,CANTO XXVI,"Learn what thou wishest. Guinicelli I,"
11696,CANTO XXVI,"Who having truly sorrow’d ere my last,"
11697,CANTO XXVI,"Already cleanse me.” With such pious joy,"
11698,CANTO XXVI,As the two sons upon their mother gaz’d
11699,CANTO XXVI,"From sad Lycurgus rescu’d, such my joy"
11700,CANTO XXVI,(Save that I more represt it) when I heard
11701,CANTO XXVI,"From his own lips the name of him pronounc’d,"
11702,CANTO XXVI,"Who was a father to me, and to those"
11703,CANTO XXVI,"My betters, who have ever us’d the sweet"
11704,CANTO XXVI,And pleasant rhymes of love. So nought I heard
11705,CANTO XXVI,"Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,"
11706,CANTO XXVI,"Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,"
11707,CANTO XXVI,Approach’d not nearer. When my eyes were fed
11708,CANTO XXVI,"By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,"
11709,CANTO XXVI,"As forces credence, I devoted me"
11710,CANTO XXVI,Unto his service wholly. In reply
11711,CANTO XXVI,He thus bespake me: “What from thee I hear
11712,CANTO XXVI,"Is grav’d so deeply on my mind, the waves"
11713,CANTO XXVI,"Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make"
11714,CANTO XXVI,A whit less lively. But as now thy oath
11715,CANTO XXVI,"Has seal’d the truth, declare what cause impels"
11716,CANTO XXVI,"That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray.”"
11717,CANTO XXVI,
11718,CANTO XXVI,"“Those dulcet lays,” I answer’d, “which, as long"
11719,CANTO XXVI,"As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,"
11720,CANTO XXVI,Shall make us love the very ink that trac’d them.”
11721,CANTO XXVI,
11722,CANTO XXVI,"“Brother!” he cried, and pointed at a shade"
11723,CANTO XXVI,"Before him, “there is one, whose mother speech"
11724,CANTO XXVI,Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.
11725,CANTO XXVI,He in love ditties and the tales of prose
11726,CANTO XXVI,"Without a rival stands, and lets the fools"
11727,CANTO XXVI,"Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges"
11728,CANTO XXVI,O’ertops him. Rumour and the popular voice
11729,CANTO XXVI,"They look to more than truth, and so confirm"
11730,CANTO XXVI,"Opinion, ere by art or reason taught."
11731,CANTO XXVI,Thus many of the elder time cried up
11732,CANTO XXVI,"Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth"
11733,CANTO XXVI,By strength of numbers vanquish’d. If thou own
11734,CANTO XXVI,"So ample privilege, as to have gain’d"
11735,CANTO XXVI,"Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ"
11736,CANTO XXVI,"Is Abbot of the college, say to him"
11737,CANTO XXVI,"One paternoster for me, far as needs"
11738,CANTO XXVI,"For dwellers in this world, where power to sin"
11739,CANTO XXVI,No longer tempts us.” Haply to make way
11740,CANTO XXVI,"For one, that follow’d next, when that was said,"
11741,CANTO XXVI,"He vanish’d through the fire, as through the wave"
11742,CANTO XXVI,"A fish, that glances diving to the deep."
11743,CANTO XXVI,
11744,CANTO XXVI,"I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew"
11745,CANTO XXVI,"A little onward, and besought his name,"
11746,CANTO XXVI,"For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room."
11747,CANTO XXVI,He frankly thus began: “Thy courtesy
11748,CANTO XXVI,"So wins on me, I have nor power nor will"
11749,CANTO XXVI,"To hide me. I am Arnault; and with songs,"
11750,CANTO XXVI,"Sorely lamenting for my folly past,"
11751,CANTO XXVI,"Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see"
11752,CANTO XXVI,"The day, I hope for, smiling in my view."
11753,CANTO XXVI,I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up
11754,CANTO XXVI,"Unto the summit of the scale, in time"
11755,CANTO XXVI,Remember ye my suff’rings.” With such words
11756,CANTO XXVI,He disappear’d in the refining flame.
11757,CANTO XXVI,
11758,CANTO XXVI,
11759,CANTO XXVI,
11760,CANTO XXVI,
11761,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
11762,CANTO XXVII,
11763,CANTO XXVII,
11764,CANTO XXVII,"Now was the sun so station’d, as when first"
11765,CANTO XXVII,"His early radiance quivers on the heights,"
11766,CANTO XXVII,"Where stream’d his Maker’s blood, while Libra hangs"
11767,CANTO XXVII,"Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires"
11768,CANTO XXVII,Meridian flash on Ganges’ yellow tide.
11769,CANTO XXVII,
11770,CANTO XXVII,"So day was sinking, when the’ angel of God"
11771,CANTO XXVII,Appear’d before us. Joy was in his mien.
11772,CANTO XXVII,"Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,"
11773,CANTO XXVII,"And with a voice, whose lively clearness far"
11774,CANTO XXVII,"Surpass’d our human, “Blessed are the pure"
11775,CANTO XXVII,"In heart,” he Sang: then near him as we came,"
11776,CANTO XXVII,"“Go ye not further, holy spirits!” he cried,"
11777,CANTO XXVII,“Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list
11778,CANTO XXVII,Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.”
11779,CANTO XXVII,
11780,CANTO XXVII,"I, when I heard his saying, was as one"
11781,CANTO XXVII,"Laid in the grave. My hands together clasp’d,"
11782,CANTO XXVII,"And upward stretching, on the fire I look’d,"
11783,CANTO XXVII,And busy fancy conjur’d up the forms
11784,CANTO XXVII,Erewhile beheld alive consum’d in flames.
11785,CANTO XXVII,
11786,CANTO XXVII,Th’ escorting spirits turn’d with gentle looks
11787,CANTO XXVII,"Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: “My son,"
11788,CANTO XXVII,"Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death."
11789,CANTO XXVII,"Remember thee, remember thee, if I"
11790,CANTO XXVII,Safe e’en on Geryon brought thee: now I come
11791,CANTO XXVII,"More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?"
11792,CANTO XXVII,Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame
11793,CANTO XXVII,"A thousand years contain’d thee, from thy head"
11794,CANTO XXVII,"No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth,"
11795,CANTO XXVII,"Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture’s hem"
11796,CANTO XXVII,"Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief."
11797,CANTO XXVII,"Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside."
11798,CANTO XXVII,"Turn hither, and come onward undismay’d.”"
11799,CANTO XXVII,"I still, though conscience urg’d’ no step advanc’d."
11800,CANTO XXVII,
11801,CANTO XXVII,"When still he saw me fix’d and obstinate,"
11802,CANTO XXVII,"Somewhat disturb’d he cried: “Mark now, my son,"
11803,CANTO XXVII,From Beatrice thou art by this wall
11804,CANTO XXVII,Divided.” As at Thisbe’s name the eye
11805,CANTO XXVII,Of Pyramus was open’d (when life ebb’d
11806,CANTO XXVII,"Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,"
11807,CANTO XXVII,While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn’d
11808,CANTO XXVII,"To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard"
11809,CANTO XXVII,"The name, that springs forever in my breast."
11810,CANTO XXVII,
11811,CANTO XXVII,"He shook his forehead; and, “How long,” he said,"
11812,CANTO XXVII,"“Linger we now?” then smil’d, as one would smile"
11813,CANTO XXVII,"Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields."
11814,CANTO XXVII,Into the fire before me then he walk’d;
11815,CANTO XXVII,"And Statius, who erewhile no little space"
11816,CANTO XXVII,"Had parted us, he pray’d to come behind."
11817,CANTO XXVII,
11818,CANTO XXVII,I would have cast me into molten glass
11819,CANTO XXVII,"To cool me, when I enter’d; so intense"
11820,CANTO XXVII,"Rag’d the conflagrant mass. The sire belov’d,"
11821,CANTO XXVII,"To comfort me, as he proceeded, still"
11822,CANTO XXVII,"Of Beatrice talk’d. “Her eyes,” saith he,"
11823,CANTO XXVII,“E’en now I seem to view.” From the other side
11824,CANTO XXVII,"A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice"
11825,CANTO XXVII,"Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,"
11826,CANTO XXVII,"There where the path led upward. “Come,” we heard,"
11827,CANTO XXVII,"“Come, blessed of my Father.” Such the sounds,"
11828,CANTO XXVII,"That hail’d us from within a light, which shone"
11829,CANTO XXVII,"So radiant, I could not endure the view."
11830,CANTO XXVII,"“The sun,” it added, “hastes: and evening comes."
11831,CANTO XXVII,Delay not: ere the western sky is hung
11832,CANTO XXVII,"With blackness, strive ye for the pass.” Our way"
11833,CANTO XXVII,"Upright within the rock arose, and fac’d"
11834,CANTO XXVII,"Such part of heav’n, that from before my steps"
11835,CANTO XXVII,The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.
11836,CANTO XXVII,
11837,CANTO XXVII,"Nor many stairs were overpass, when now"
11838,CANTO XXVII,By fading of the shadow we perceiv’d
11839,CANTO XXVII,The sun behind us couch’d: and ere one face
11840,CANTO XXVII,Of darkness o’er its measureless expanse
11841,CANTO XXVII,"Involv’d th’ horizon, and the night her lot"
11842,CANTO XXVII,"Held individual, each of us had made"
11843,CANTO XXVII,"A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,"
11844,CANTO XXVII,"Had fail’d us, by the nature of that mount"
11845,CANTO XXVII,"Forbidden further travel. As the goats,"
11846,CANTO XXVII,That late have skipp’d and wanton’d rapidly
11847,CANTO XXVII,"Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta’en"
11848,CANTO XXVII,"Their supper on the herb, now silent lie"
11849,CANTO XXVII,"And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,"
11850,CANTO XXVII,While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans
11851,CANTO XXVII,"Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:"
11852,CANTO XXVII,"And as the swain, that lodges out all night"
11853,CANTO XXVII,"In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey"
11854,CANTO XXVII,"Disperse them; even so all three abode,"
11855,CANTO XXVII,"I as a goat and as the shepherds they,"
11856,CANTO XXVII,Close pent on either side by shelving rock.
11857,CANTO XXVII,
11858,CANTO XXVII,A little glimpse of sky was seen above;
11859,CANTO XXVII,Yet by that little I beheld the stars
11860,CANTO XXVII,In magnitude and rustle shining forth
11861,CANTO XXVII,"With more than wonted glory. As I lay,"
11862,CANTO XXVII,"Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,"
11863,CANTO XXVII,"Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft"
11864,CANTO XXVII,"Tidings of future hap. About the hour,"
11865,CANTO XXVII,"As I believe, when Venus from the east"
11866,CANTO XXVII,"First lighten’d on the mountain, she whose orb"
11867,CANTO XXVII,"Seems always glowing with the fire of love,"
11868,CANTO XXVII,"A lady young and beautiful, I dream’d,"
11869,CANTO XXVII,"Was passing o’er a lea; and, as she came,"
11870,CANTO XXVII,Methought I saw her ever and anon
11871,CANTO XXVII,Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:
11872,CANTO XXVII,"“Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,"
11873,CANTO XXVII,That I am Leah: for my brow to weave
11874,CANTO XXVII,"A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply."
11875,CANTO XXVII,"To please me at the crystal mirror, here"
11876,CANTO XXVII,"I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she"
11877,CANTO XXVII,"Before her glass abides the livelong day,"
11878,CANTO XXVII,"Her radiant eyes beholding, charm’d no less,"
11879,CANTO XXVII,Than I with this delightful task. Her joy
11880,CANTO XXVII,"In contemplation, as in labour mine.”"
11881,CANTO XXVII,
11882,CANTO XXVII,"And now as glimm’ring dawn appear’d, that breaks"
11883,CANTO XXVII,"More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he"
11884,CANTO XXVII,"Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,"
11885,CANTO XXVII,"Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled"
11886,CANTO XXVII,My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide
11887,CANTO XXVII,"Already risen. “That delicious fruit,"
11888,CANTO XXVII,Which through so many a branch the zealous care
11889,CANTO XXVII,"Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day"
11890,CANTO XXVII,Appease thy hunger.” Such the words I heard
11891,CANTO XXVII,From Virgil’s lip; and never greeting heard
11892,CANTO XXVII,So pleasant as the sounds. Within me straight
11893,CANTO XXVII,"Desire so grew upon desire to mount,"
11894,CANTO XXVII,Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings
11895,CANTO XXVII,Increasing for my flight. When we had run
11896,CANTO XXVII,"O’er all the ladder to its topmost round,"
11897,CANTO XXVII,"As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix’d"
11898,CANTO XXVII,"His eyes, and thus he spake: “Both fires, my son,"
11899,CANTO XXVII,"The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,"
11900,CANTO XXVII,"And art arriv’d, where of itself my ken"
11901,CANTO XXVII,No further reaches. I with skill and art
11902,CANTO XXVII,Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take
11903,CANTO XXVII,"For guide. Thou hast o’ercome the steeper way,"
11904,CANTO XXVII,"O’ercome the straighter. Lo! the sun, that darts"
11905,CANTO XXVII,"His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,"
11906,CANTO XXVII,"The arboreta and flowers, which of itself"
11907,CANTO XXVII,This land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes
11908,CANTO XXVII,"With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste"
11909,CANTO XXVII,"To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,"
11910,CANTO XXVII,Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more
11911,CANTO XXVII,"Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,"
11912,CANTO XXVII,"Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,"
11913,CANTO XXVII,"Discreet, judicious. To distrust thy sense"
11914,CANTO XXVII,Were henceforth error. I invest thee then
11915,CANTO XXVII,"With crown and mitre, sovereign o’er thyself.”"
11916,CANTO XXVII,
11917,CANTO XXVII,
11918,CANTO XXVII,

11920,CANTO XXVIII,CANTO XXVIII
11921,CANTO XXVIII,
11922,CANTO XXVIII,
11923,CANTO XXVIII,"Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade"
11924,CANTO XXVIII,With lively greenness the new-springing day
11925,CANTO XXVIII,"Attemper’d, eager now to roam, and search"
11926,CANTO XXVIII,"Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,"
11927,CANTO XXVIII,Along the champain leisurely my way
11928,CANTO XXVIII,"Pursuing, o’er the ground, that on all sides"
11929,CANTO XXVIII,"Delicious odour breath’d. A pleasant air,"
11930,CANTO XXVIII,"That intermitted never, never veer’d,"
11931,CANTO XXVIII,"Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind"
11932,CANTO XXVIII,"Of softest influence: at which the sprays,"
11933,CANTO XXVIII,"Obedient all, lean’d trembling to that part"
11934,CANTO XXVIII,"Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,"
11935,CANTO XXVIII,"Yet were not so disorder’d, but that still"
11936,CANTO XXVIII,Upon their top the feather’d quiristers
11937,CANTO XXVIII,"Applied their wonted art, and with full joy"
11938,CANTO XXVIII,"Welcom’d those hours of prime, and warbled shrill"
11939,CANTO XXVIII,"Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays"
11940,CANTO XXVIII,"inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,"
11941,CANTO XXVIII,Along the piney forests on the shore
11942,CANTO XXVIII,"Of Chiassi, rolls the gath’ring melody,"
11943,CANTO XXVIII,When Eolus hath from his cavern loos’d
11944,CANTO XXVIII,"The dripping south. Already had my steps,"
11945,CANTO XXVIII,"Though slow, so far into that ancient wood"
11946,CANTO XXVIII,"Transported me, I could not ken the place"
11947,CANTO XXVIII,"Where I had enter’d, when behold! my path"
11948,CANTO XXVIII,"Was bounded by a rill, which to the left"
11949,CANTO XXVIII,"With little rippling waters bent the grass,"
11950,CANTO XXVIII,That issued from its brink. On earth no wave
11951,CANTO XXVIII,"How clean soe’er, that would not seem to have"
11952,CANTO XXVIII,"Some mixture in itself, compar’d with this,"
11953,CANTO XXVIII,"Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll’d,"
11954,CANTO XXVIII,"Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne’er"
11955,CANTO XXVIII,Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.
11956,CANTO XXVIII,
11957,CANTO XXVIII,My feet advanc’d not; but my wond’ring eyes
11958,CANTO XXVIII,"Pass’d onward, o’er the streamlet, to survey"
11959,CANTO XXVIII,"The tender May-bloom, flush’d through many a hue,"
11960,CANTO XXVIII,"In prodigal variety: and there,"
11961,CANTO XXVIII,"As object, rising suddenly to view,"
11962,CANTO XXVIII,That from our bosom every thought beside
11963,CANTO XXVIII,"With the rare marvel chases, I beheld"
11964,CANTO XXVIII,"A lady all alone, who, singing, went,"
11965,CANTO XXVIII,"And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way"
11966,CANTO XXVIII,Was all o’er painted. “Lady beautiful!
11967,CANTO XXVIII,"Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,"
11968,CANTO XXVIII,"Are worthy of our trust), with love’s own beam"
11969,CANTO XXVIII,"Dost warm thee,” thus to her my speech I fram’d:"
11970,CANTO XXVIII,“Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend
11971,CANTO XXVIII,"Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song."
11972,CANTO XXVIII,"Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,"
11973,CANTO XXVIII,I call to mind where wander’d and how look’d
11974,CANTO XXVIII,"Proserpine, in that season, when her child"
11975,CANTO XXVIII,"The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.”"
11976,CANTO XXVIII,
11977,CANTO XXVIII,"As when a lady, turning in the dance,"
11978,CANTO XXVIII,"Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce"
11979,CANTO XXVIII,One step before the other to the ground;
11980,CANTO XXVIII,Over the yellow and vermilion flowers
11981,CANTO XXVIII,"Thus turn’d she at my suit, most maiden-like,"
11982,CANTO XXVIII,"Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,"
11983,CANTO XXVIII,That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.
11984,CANTO XXVIII,Arriving where the limped waters now
11985,CANTO XXVIII,"Lav’d the green sward, her eyes she deign’d to raise,"
11986,CANTO XXVIII,"That shot such splendour on me, as I ween"
11987,CANTO XXVIII,"Ne’er glanced from Cytherea’s, when her son"
11988,CANTO XXVIII,Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.
11989,CANTO XXVIII,Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil’d
11990,CANTO XXVIII,through her graceful fingers shifted still
11991,CANTO XXVIII,"The intermingling dyes, which without seed"
11992,CANTO XXVIII,That lofty land unbosoms. By the stream
11993,CANTO XXVIII,Three paces only were we sunder’d: yet
11994,CANTO XXVIII,"The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass’d it o’er,"
11995,CANTO XXVIII,(A curb for ever to the pride of man)
11996,CANTO XXVIII,Was by Leander not more hateful held
11997,CANTO XXVIII,"For floating, with inhospitable wave"
11998,CANTO XXVIII,"’Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me"
11999,CANTO XXVIII,"That flood, because it gave no passage thence."
12000,CANTO XXVIII,
12001,CANTO XXVIII,"“Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,"
12002,CANTO XXVIII,"That cradled human nature in its birth,"
12003,CANTO XXVIII,"Wond’ring, ye not without suspicion view"
12004,CANTO XXVIII,"My smiles: but that sweet strain of psalmody,"
12005,CANTO XXVIII,"‘Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,’ will give ye light,"
12006,CANTO XXVIII,"Which may uncloud your minds. And thou, who stand’st"
12007,CANTO XXVIII,"The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,"
12008,CANTO XXVIII,Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I
12009,CANTO XXVIII,Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine.”
12010,CANTO XXVIII,
12011,CANTO XXVIII,She spake; and I replied: “l know not how
12012,CANTO XXVIII,To reconcile this wave and rustling sound
12013,CANTO XXVIII,"Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard"
12014,CANTO XXVIII,Of opposite report.” She answering thus:
12015,CANTO XXVIII,"“I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,"
12016,CANTO XXVIII,Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud
12017,CANTO XXVIII,"That hath enwraps thee. The First Good, whose joy"
12018,CANTO XXVIII,"Is only in himself, created man"
12019,CANTO XXVIII,"For happiness, and gave this goodly place,"
12020,CANTO XXVIII,His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.
12021,CANTO XXVIII,"Favour’d thus highly, through his own defect"
12022,CANTO XXVIII,"He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,"
12023,CANTO XXVIII,"And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang’d"
12024,CANTO XXVIII,Laughter unblam’d and ever-new delight.
12025,CANTO XXVIII,"That vapours none, exhal’d from earth beneath,"
12026,CANTO XXVIII,"Or from the waters (which, wherever heat"
12027,CANTO XXVIII,"Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far"
12028,CANTO XXVIII,"To vex man’s peaceful state, this mountain rose"
12029,CANTO XXVIII,"So high toward the heav’n, nor fears the rage"
12030,CANTO XXVIII,"0f elements contending, from that part"
12031,CANTO XXVIII,"Exempted, where the gate his limit bars."
12032,CANTO XXVIII,Because the circumambient air throughout
12033,CANTO XXVIII,"With its first impulse circles still, unless"
12034,CANTO XXVIII,Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;
12035,CANTO XXVIII,"Upon the summit, which on every side"
12036,CANTO XXVIII,To visitation of th’ impassive air
12037,CANTO XXVIII,"Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes"
12038,CANTO XXVIII,Beneath its sway th’ umbrageous wood resound:
12039,CANTO XXVIII,"And in the shaken plant such power resides,"
12040,CANTO XXVIII,That it impregnates with its efficacy
12041,CANTO XXVIII,"The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume"
12042,CANTO XXVIII,That wafted flies abroad; and th’ other land
12043,CANTO XXVIII,"Receiving (as ’tis worthy in itself,"
12044,CANTO XXVIII,"Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,"
12045,CANTO XXVIII,And from its womb produces many a tree
12046,CANTO XXVIII,"Of various virtue. This when thou hast heard,"
12047,CANTO XXVIII,"The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth"
12048,CANTO XXVIII,Some plant without apparent seed be found
12049,CANTO XXVIII,"To fix its fibrous stem. And further learn,"
12050,CANTO XXVIII,"That with prolific foison of all seeds,"
12051,CANTO XXVIII,"This holy plain is fill’d, and in itself"
12052,CANTO XXVIII,Bears fruit that ne’er was pluck’d on other soil.
12053,CANTO XXVIII,"“The water, thou behold’st, springs not from vein,"
12054,CANTO XXVIII,"As stream, that intermittently repairs"
12055,CANTO XXVIII,"And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth"
12056,CANTO XXVIII,"From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;"
12057,CANTO XXVIII,"And by the will omnific, full supply"
12058,CANTO XXVIII,Feeds whatsoe’er On either side it pours;
12059,CANTO XXVIII,On this devolv’d with power to take away
12060,CANTO XXVIII,"Remembrance of offence, on that to bring"
12061,CANTO XXVIII,Remembrance back of every good deed done.
12062,CANTO XXVIII,From whence its name of Lethe on this part;
12063,CANTO XXVIII,On th’ other Eunoe: both of which must first
12064,CANTO XXVIII,Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding
12065,CANTO XXVIII,All flavours else. Albeit thy thirst may now
12066,CANTO XXVIII,"Be well contented, if I here break off,"
12067,CANTO XXVIII,No more revealing: yet a corollary
12068,CANTO XXVIII,I freely give beside: nor deem my words
12069,CANTO XXVIII,"Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass"
12070,CANTO XXVIII,"The stretch of promise. They, whose verse of yore"
12071,CANTO XXVIII,"The golden age recorded and its bliss,"
12072,CANTO XXVIII,"On the Parnassian mountain, of this place"
12073,CANTO XXVIII,"Perhaps had dream’d. Here was man guiltless, here"
12074,CANTO XXVIII,"Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this"
12075,CANTO XXVIII,"The far-fam’d nectar.” Turning to the bards,"
12076,CANTO XXVIII,"When she had ceas’d, I noted in their looks"
12077,CANTO XXVIII,A smile at her conclusion; then my face
12078,CANTO XXVIII,Again directed to the lovely dame.
12079,CANTO XXVIII,
12080,CANTO XXVIII,
12081,CANTO XXVIII,
12082,CANTO XXVIII,
12083,CANTO XXIX,CANTO XXIX
12084,CANTO XXIX,
12085,CANTO XXIX,
12086,CANTO XXIX,"Singing, as if enamour’d, she resum’d"
12087,CANTO XXIX,"And clos’d the song, with “Blessed they whose sins"
12088,CANTO XXIX,"Are cover’d.” Like the wood-nymphs then, that tripp’d"
12089,CANTO XXIX,"Singly across the sylvan shadows, one"
12090,CANTO XXIX,"Eager to view and one to ’scape the sun,"
12091,CANTO XXIX,"So mov’d she on, against the current, up"
12092,CANTO XXIX,"The verdant rivage. I, her mincing step"
12093,CANTO XXIX,"Observing, with as tardy step pursued."
12094,CANTO XXIX,
12095,CANTO XXIX,"Between us not an hundred paces trod,"
12096,CANTO XXIX,"The bank, on each side bending equally,"
12097,CANTO XXIX,Gave me to face the orient. Nor our way
12098,CANTO XXIX,"Far onward brought us, when to me at once"
12099,CANTO XXIX,"She turn’d, and cried: “My brother! look and hearken.”"
12100,CANTO XXIX,And lo! a sudden lustre ran across
12101,CANTO XXIX,"Through the great forest on all parts, so bright"
12102,CANTO XXIX,I doubted whether lightning were abroad;
12103,CANTO XXIX,"But that expiring ever in the spleen,"
12104,CANTO XXIX,"That doth unfold it, and this during still"
12105,CANTO XXIX,"And waxing still in splendor, made me question"
12106,CANTO XXIX,What it might be: and a sweet melody
12107,CANTO XXIX,Ran through the luminous air. Then did I chide
12108,CANTO XXIX,With warrantable zeal the hardihood
12109,CANTO XXIX,"Of our first parent, for that there were earth"
12110,CANTO XXIX,"Stood in obedience to the heav’ns, she only,"
12111,CANTO XXIX,"Woman, the creature of an hour, endur’d not"
12112,CANTO XXIX,Restraint of any veil: which had she borne
12113,CANTO XXIX,"Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,"
12114,CANTO XXIX,"Had from the first, and long time since, been mine."
12115,CANTO XXIX,
12116,CANTO XXIX,While through that wilderness of primy sweets
12117,CANTO XXIX,"That never fade, suspense I walk’d, and yet"
12118,CANTO XXIX,"Expectant of beatitude more high,"
12119,CANTO XXIX,"Before us, like a blazing fire, the air"
12120,CANTO XXIX,"Under the green boughs glow’d; and, for a song,"
12121,CANTO XXIX,Distinct the sound of melody was heard.
12122,CANTO XXIX,
12123,CANTO XXIX,O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes
12124,CANTO XXIX,"If e’er I suffer’d hunger, cold and watching,"
12125,CANTO XXIX,Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.
12126,CANTO XXIX,Now through my breast let Helicon his stream
12127,CANTO XXIX,Pour copious; and Urania with her choir
12128,CANTO XXIX,Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds
12129,CANTO XXIX,Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.
12130,CANTO XXIX,
12131,CANTO XXIX,"Onward a space, what seem’d seven trees of gold,"
12132,CANTO XXIX,The intervening distance to mine eye
12133,CANTO XXIX,Falsely presented; but when I was come
12134,CANTO XXIX,"So near them, that no lineament was lost"
12135,CANTO XXIX,"Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen"
12136,CANTO XXIX,"Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,"
12137,CANTO XXIX,"Then did the faculty, that ministers"
12138,CANTO XXIX,"Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold"
12139,CANTO XXIX,"Distinguish, and it th’ singing trace the sound"
12140,CANTO XXIX,"“Hosanna.” Above, their beauteous garniture"
12141,CANTO XXIX,"Flam’d with more ample lustre, than the moon"
12142,CANTO XXIX,Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.
12143,CANTO XXIX,
12144,CANTO XXIX,I turn’d me full of wonder to my guide;
12145,CANTO XXIX,And he did answer with a countenance
12146,CANTO XXIX,Charg’d with no less amazement: whence my view
12147,CANTO XXIX,"Reverted to those lofty things, which came"
12148,CANTO XXIX,"So slowly moving towards us, that the bride"
12149,CANTO XXIX,Would have outstript them on her bridal day.
12150,CANTO XXIX,
12151,CANTO XXIX,The lady called aloud: “Why thus yet burns
12152,CANTO XXIX,"Affection in thee for these living, lights,"
12153,CANTO XXIX,And dost not look on that which follows them?”
12154,CANTO XXIX,
12155,CANTO XXIX,"I straightway mark’d a tribe behind them walk,"
12156,CANTO XXIX,"As if attendant on their leaders, cloth’d"
12157,CANTO XXIX,"With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth"
12158,CANTO XXIX,"Was never. On my left, the wat’ry gleam"
12159,CANTO XXIX,"Borrow’d, and gave me back, when there I look’d."
12160,CANTO XXIX,"As in a mirror, my left side portray’d."
12161,CANTO XXIX,
12162,CANTO XXIX,When I had chosen on the river’s edge
12163,CANTO XXIX,"Such station, that the distance of the stream"
12164,CANTO XXIX,Alone did separate me; there I stay’d
12165,CANTO XXIX,"My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld"
12166,CANTO XXIX,"The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,"
12167,CANTO XXIX,The air behind them painted as with trail
12168,CANTO XXIX,Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark’d
12169,CANTO XXIX,"All those sev’n listed colours, whence the sun"
12170,CANTO XXIX,"Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone."
12171,CANTO XXIX,These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond
12172,CANTO XXIX,"My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,"
12173,CANTO XXIX,Parted the outermost. Beneath a sky
12174,CANTO XXIX,"So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,"
12175,CANTO XXIX,"By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown’d."
12176,CANTO XXIX,All sang one song: “Blessed be thou among
12177,CANTO XXIX,The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness
12178,CANTO XXIX,"Blessed for ever!” After that the flowers,"
12179,CANTO XXIX,"And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,"
12180,CANTO XXIX,Were free from that elected race; as light
12181,CANTO XXIX,"In heav’n doth second light, came after them"
12182,CANTO XXIX,"Four animals, each crown’d with verdurous leaf."
12183,CANTO XXIX,"With six wings each was plum’d, the plumage full"
12184,CANTO XXIX,"Of eyes, and th’ eyes of Argus would be such,"
12185,CANTO XXIX,"Were they endued with life. Reader, more rhymes"
12186,CANTO XXIX,Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:
12187,CANTO XXIX,"For other need no straitens, that in this"
12188,CANTO XXIX,I may not give my bounty room. But read
12189,CANTO XXIX,"Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north"
12190,CANTO XXIX,"How he beheld them come by Chebar’s flood,"
12191,CANTO XXIX,"In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such"
12192,CANTO XXIX,"As thou shalt find them character’d by him,"
12193,CANTO XXIX,"Here were they; save as to the pennons; there,"
12194,CANTO XXIX,"From him departing, John accords with me."
12195,CANTO XXIX,
12196,CANTO XXIX,"The space, surrounded by the four, enclos’d"
12197,CANTO XXIX,A car triumphal: on two wheels it came
12198,CANTO XXIX,Drawn at a Gryphon’s neck; and he above
12199,CANTO XXIX,"Stretch’d either wing uplifted, ’tween the midst"
12200,CANTO XXIX,"And the three listed hues, on each side three;"
12201,CANTO XXIX,So that the wings did cleave or injure none;
12202,CANTO XXIX,"And out of sight they rose. The members, far"
12203,CANTO XXIX,"As he was bird, were golden; white the rest"
12204,CANTO XXIX,With vermeil intervein’d. So beautiful
12205,CANTO XXIX,"A car in Rome ne’er grac’d Augustus pomp,"
12206,CANTO XXIX,Or Africanus’: e’en the sun’s itself
12207,CANTO XXIX,"Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun"
12208,CANTO XXIX,"Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell"
12209,CANTO XXIX,"At Tellus’ pray’r devout, by the just doom"
12210,CANTO XXIX,Mysterious of all-seeing Jove. Three nymphs
12211,CANTO XXIX,",k the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;"
12212,CANTO XXIX,"The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce"
12213,CANTO XXIX,Been known within a furnace of clear flame:
12214,CANTO XXIX,"The next did look, as if the flesh and bones"
12215,CANTO XXIX,Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem’d the third.
12216,CANTO XXIX,"Now seem’d the white to lead, the ruddy now;"
12217,CANTO XXIX,"And from her song who led, the others took"
12218,CANTO XXIX,"Their treasure, swift or slow. At th’ other wheel,"
12219,CANTO XXIX,"A band quaternion, each in purple clad,"
12220,CANTO XXIX,"Advanc’d with festal step, as of them one"
12221,CANTO XXIX,"The rest conducted, one, upon whose front"
12222,CANTO XXIX,"Three eyes were seen. In rear of all this group,"
12223,CANTO XXIX,"Two old men I beheld, dissimilar"
12224,CANTO XXIX,"In raiment, but in port and gesture like,"
12225,CANTO XXIX,Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one
12226,CANTO XXIX,Did show himself some favour’d counsellor
12227,CANTO XXIX,"Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made"
12228,CANTO XXIX,To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.
12229,CANTO XXIX,"His fellow mark’d an opposite intent,"
12230,CANTO XXIX,"Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,"
12231,CANTO XXIX,"E’en as I view’d it with the flood between,"
12232,CANTO XXIX,"Appall’d me. Next four others I beheld,"
12233,CANTO XXIX,"Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,"
12234,CANTO XXIX,"One single old man, sleeping, as he came,"
12235,CANTO XXIX,"With a shrewd visage. And these seven, each"
12236,CANTO XXIX,"Like the first troop were habited, hut wore"
12237,CANTO XXIX,No braid of lilies on their temples wreath’d.
12238,CANTO XXIX,"Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,"
12239,CANTO XXIX,"A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,"
12240,CANTO XXIX,That they were all on fire above their brow.
12241,CANTO XXIX,
12242,CANTO XXIX,"Whenas the car was o’er against me, straight."
12243,CANTO XXIX,"Was heard a thund’ring, at whose voice it seem’d"
12244,CANTO XXIX,"The chosen multitude were stay’d; for there,"
12245,CANTO XXIX,"With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt."
12246,CANTO XXIX,
12247,CANTO XXIX,
12248,CANTO XXIX,
12249,CANTO XXIX,
12250,CANTO XXX,CANTO XXX
12251,CANTO XXX,
12252,CANTO XXX,
12253,CANTO XXX,"Soon as the polar light, which never knows"
12254,CANTO XXX,"Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil"
12255,CANTO XXX,"Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament"
12256,CANTO XXX,"Of the first heav’n, to duty each one there"
12257,CANTO XXX,"Safely convoying, as that lower doth"
12258,CANTO XXX,"The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix’d;"
12259,CANTO XXX,"Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van"
12260,CANTO XXX,"Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,"
12261,CANTO XXX,"Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:"
12262,CANTO XXX,"And one, as if commission’d from above,"
12263,CANTO XXX,In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:
12264,CANTO XXX,"“Come, spouse, from Libanus!” and all the rest"
12265,CANTO XXX,Took up the song—At the last audit so
12266,CANTO XXX,"The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each"
12267,CANTO XXX,"Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,"
12268,CANTO XXX,"As, on the sacred litter, at the voice"
12269,CANTO XXX,"Authoritative of that elder, sprang"
12270,CANTO XXX,A hundred ministers and messengers
12271,CANTO XXX,Of life eternal. “Blessed thou! who com’st!”
12272,CANTO XXX,"And, “O,” they cried, “from full hands scatter ye"
12273,CANTO XXX,"Unwith’ring lilies;” and, so saying, cast"
12274,CANTO XXX,Flowers over head and round them on all sides.
12275,CANTO XXX,
12276,CANTO XXX,"I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,"
12277,CANTO XXX,"The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky"
12278,CANTO XXX,"Oppos’d, one deep and beautiful serene,"
12279,CANTO XXX,"And the sun’s face so shaded, and with mists"
12280,CANTO XXX,"Attemper’d at lids rising, that the eye"
12281,CANTO XXX,Long while endur’d the sight: thus in a cloud
12282,CANTO XXX,"Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,"
12283,CANTO XXX,"And down, within and outside of the car,"
12284,CANTO XXX,"Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath’d,"
12285,CANTO XXX,"A virgin in my view appear’d, beneath"
12286,CANTO XXX,"Green mantle, rob’d in hue of living flame:"
12287,CANTO XXX,"And o’er my Spirit, that in former days"
12288,CANTO XXX,"Within her presence had abode so long,"
12289,CANTO XXX,No shudd’ring terror crept. Mine eyes no more
12290,CANTO XXX,Had knowledge of her; yet there mov’d from her
12291,CANTO XXX,"A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak’d,"
12292,CANTO XXX,The power of ancient love was strong within me.
12293,CANTO XXX,
12294,CANTO XXX,"No sooner on my vision streaming, smote"
12295,CANTO XXX,"The heav’nly influence, which years past, and e’en"
12296,CANTO XXX,"In childhood, thrill’d me, than towards Virgil I"
12297,CANTO XXX,"Turn’d me to leftward, panting, like a babe,"
12298,CANTO XXX,"That flees for refuge to his mother’s breast,"
12299,CANTO XXX,If aught have terrified or work’d him woe:
12300,CANTO XXX,"And would have cried: “There is no dram of blood,"
12301,CANTO XXX,That doth not quiver in me. The old flame
12302,CANTO XXX,Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:”
12303,CANTO XXX,"But Virgil had bereav’d us of himself,"
12304,CANTO XXX,"Virgil, my best-lov’d father; Virgil, he"
12305,CANTO XXX,"To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,"
12306,CANTO XXX,"All, our prime mother lost, avail’d to save"
12307,CANTO XXX,My undew’d cheeks from blur of soiling tears.
12308,CANTO XXX,
12309,CANTO XXX,"“Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,"
12310,CANTO XXX,Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge
12311,CANTO XXX,"Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.”"
12312,CANTO XXX,
12313,CANTO XXX,"As to the prow or stern, some admiral"
12314,CANTO XXX,"Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,"
12315,CANTO XXX,When ’mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;
12316,CANTO XXX,"Thus on the left side of the car I saw,"
12317,CANTO XXX,"(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,"
12318,CANTO XXX,Which here I am compell’d to register)
12319,CANTO XXX,"The virgin station’d, who before appeared"
12320,CANTO XXX,Veil’d in that festive shower angelical.
12321,CANTO XXX,
12322,CANTO XXX,"Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;"
12323,CANTO XXX,"Though from her brow the veil descending, bound"
12324,CANTO XXX,"With foliage of Minerva, suffer’d not"
12325,CANTO XXX,That I beheld her clearly; then with act
12326,CANTO XXX,"Full royal, still insulting o’er her thrall,"
12327,CANTO XXX,"Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back"
12328,CANTO XXX,"The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:"
12329,CANTO XXX,"“Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am"
12330,CANTO XXX,Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign’d at last
12331,CANTO XXX,"Approach the mountain? knewest not, O man!"
12332,CANTO XXX,Thy happiness is whole?” Down fell mine eyes
12333,CANTO XXX,"On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,"
12334,CANTO XXX,"Recoil’d, and sought the greensward: such a weight"
12335,CANTO XXX,Of shame was on my forehead. With a mien
12336,CANTO XXX,"Of that stern majesty, which doth surround"
12337,CANTO XXX,"mother’s presence to her awe-struck child,"
12338,CANTO XXX,She look’d; a flavour of such bitterness
12339,CANTO XXX,Was mingled in her pity. There her words
12340,CANTO XXX,"Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:"
12341,CANTO XXX,"“In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:”"
12342,CANTO XXX,"But went no farther than, “Thou Lord, hast set"
12343,CANTO XXX,"My feet in ample room.” As snow, that lies"
12344,CANTO XXX,Amidst the living rafters on the back
12345,CANTO XXX,Of Italy congeal’d when drifted high
12346,CANTO XXX,"And closely pil’d by rough Sclavonian blasts,"
12347,CANTO XXX,"Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,"
12348,CANTO XXX,"And straightway melting it distils away,"
12349,CANTO XXX,"Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,"
12350,CANTO XXX,"Without a sigh or tear, or ever these"
12351,CANTO XXX,"Did sing, that with the chiming of heav’n’s sphere,"
12352,CANTO XXX,Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain
12353,CANTO XXX,"Of dulcet symphony, express’d for me"
12354,CANTO XXX,"Their soft compassion, more than could the words"
12355,CANTO XXX,"“Virgin, why so consum’st him?” then the ice,"
12356,CANTO XXX,"Congeal’d about my bosom, turn’d itself"
12357,CANTO XXX,"To spirit and water, and with anguish forth"
12358,CANTO XXX,Gush’d through the lips and eyelids from the heart.
12359,CANTO XXX,
12360,CANTO XXX,"Upon the chariot’s right edge still she stood,"
12361,CANTO XXX,"Immovable, and thus address’d her words"
12362,CANTO XXX,To those bright semblances with pity touch’d:
12363,CANTO XXX,"“Ye in th’ eternal day your vigils keep,"
12364,CANTO XXX,"So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,"
12365,CANTO XXX,Conveys from you a single step in all
12366,CANTO XXX,The goings on of life: thence with more heed
12367,CANTO XXX,"I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,"
12368,CANTO XXX,"Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now"
12369,CANTO XXX,May equal the transgression. Not alone
12370,CANTO XXX,"Through operation of the mighty orbs,"
12371,CANTO XXX,"That mark each seed to some predestin’d aim,"
12372,CANTO XXX,As with aspect or fortunate or ill
12373,CANTO XXX,"The constellations meet, but through benign"
12374,CANTO XXX,"Largess of heav’nly graces, which rain down"
12375,CANTO XXX,"From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man"
12376,CANTO XXX,"Was in the freshness of his being, such,"
12377,CANTO XXX,"So gifted virtually, that in him"
12378,CANTO XXX,All better habits wond’rously had thriv’d.
12379,CANTO XXX,"The more of kindly strength is in the soil,"
12380,CANTO XXX,So much doth evil seed and lack of culture
12381,CANTO XXX,"Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness."
12382,CANTO XXX,These looks sometime upheld him; for I show’d
12383,CANTO XXX,"My youthful eyes, and led him by their light"
12384,CANTO XXX,In upright walking. Soon as I had reach’d
12385,CANTO XXX,"The threshold of my second age, and chang’d"
12386,CANTO XXX,"My mortal for immortal, then he left me,"
12387,CANTO XXX,And gave himself to others. When from flesh
12388,CANTO XXX,"To spirit I had risen, and increase"
12389,CANTO XXX,"Of beauty and of virtue circled me,"
12390,CANTO XXX,"I was less dear to him, and valued less."
12391,CANTO XXX,"His steps were turn’d into deceitful ways,"
12392,CANTO XXX,"Following false images of good, that make"
12393,CANTO XXX,No promise perfect. Nor avail’d me aught
12394,CANTO XXX,"To sue for inspirations, with the which,"
12395,CANTO XXX,"I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,"
12396,CANTO XXX,"Did call him back; of them so little reck’d him,"
12397,CANTO XXX,"Such depth he fell, that all device was short"
12398,CANTO XXX,"Of his preserving, save that he should view"
12399,CANTO XXX,The children of perdition. To this end
12400,CANTO XXX,I visited the purlieus of the dead:
12401,CANTO XXX,"And one, who hath conducted him thus high,"
12402,CANTO XXX,Receiv’d my supplications urg’d with weeping.
12403,CANTO XXX,"It were a breaking of God’s high decree,"
12404,CANTO XXX,"If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted"
12405,CANTO XXX,Without the cost of some repentant tear.”
12406,CANTO XXX,
12407,CANTO XXX,
12408,CANTO XXX,
12409,CANTO XXX,
12410,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
12411,CANTO XXXI,
12412,CANTO XXXI,
12413,CANTO XXXI,“O Thou!” her words she thus without delay
12414,CANTO XXXI,"Resuming, turn’d their point on me, to whom"
12415,CANTO XXXI,"They but with lateral edge seem’d harsh before,"
12416,CANTO XXXI,"‘Say thou, who stand’st beyond the holy stream,"
12417,CANTO XXXI,If this be true. A charge so grievous needs
12418,CANTO XXXI,Thine own avowal.” On my faculty
12419,CANTO XXXI,"Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir’d"
12420,CANTO XXXI,"Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth."
12421,CANTO XXXI,
12422,CANTO XXXI,"A little space refraining, then she spake:"
12423,CANTO XXXI,“What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave
12424,CANTO XXXI,On thy remembrances of evil yet
12425,CANTO XXXI,Hath done no injury.” A mingled sense
12426,CANTO XXXI,"Of fear and of confusion, from my lips"
12427,CANTO XXXI,"Did such a “Yea “ produce, as needed help"
12428,CANTO XXXI,Of vision to interpret. As when breaks
12429,CANTO XXXI,"In act to be discharg’d, a cross-bow bent"
12430,CANTO XXXI,"Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o’erstretch’d,"
12431,CANTO XXXI,The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;
12432,CANTO XXXI,"Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst"
12433,CANTO XXXI,"Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice"
12434,CANTO XXXI,Was slacken’d on its way. She straight began:
12435,CANTO XXXI,“When my desire invited thee to love
12436,CANTO XXXI,"The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,"
12437,CANTO XXXI,What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain
12438,CANTO XXXI,"Did meet thee, that thou so should’st quit the hope"
12439,CANTO XXXI,"Of further progress, or what bait of ease"
12440,CANTO XXXI,Or promise of allurement led thee on
12441,CANTO XXXI,"Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should’st rather wait?”"
12442,CANTO XXXI,
12443,CANTO XXXI,"A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice"
12444,CANTO XXXI,"To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips"
12445,CANTO XXXI,"Gave utterance, wailing: “Thy fair looks withdrawn,"
12446,CANTO XXXI,"Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn’d"
12447,CANTO XXXI,My steps aside.” She answering spake: “Hadst thou
12448,CANTO XXXI,"Been silent, or denied what thou avow’st,"
12449,CANTO XXXI,Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye
12450,CANTO XXXI,Observes it. But whene’er the sinner’s cheek
12451,CANTO XXXI,Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears
12452,CANTO XXXI,"Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel"
12453,CANTO XXXI,Of justice doth run counter to the edge.
12454,CANTO XXXI,Howe’er that thou may’st profit by thy shame
12455,CANTO XXXI,"For errors past, and that henceforth more strength"
12456,CANTO XXXI,"May arm thee, when thou hear’st the Siren-voice,"
12457,CANTO XXXI,"Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,"
12458,CANTO XXXI,"And lend attentive ear, while I unfold"
12459,CANTO XXXI,How opposite a way my buried flesh
12460,CANTO XXXI,Should have impell’d thee. Never didst thou spy
12461,CANTO XXXI,"In art or nature aught so passing sweet,"
12462,CANTO XXXI,"As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame"
12463,CANTO XXXI,"Enclos’d me, and are scatter’d now in dust."
12464,CANTO XXXI,"If sweetest thing thus fail’d thee with my death,"
12465,CANTO XXXI,"What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish"
12466,CANTO XXXI,Have tempted? When thou first hadst felt the dart
12467,CANTO XXXI,"Of perishable things, in my departing"
12468,CANTO XXXI,"For better realms, thy wing thou should’st have prun’d"
12469,CANTO XXXI,"To follow me, and never stoop’d again"
12470,CANTO XXXI,"To ’bide a second blow for a slight girl,"
12471,CANTO XXXI,Or other gaud as transient and as vain.
12472,CANTO XXXI,"The new and inexperienc’d bird awaits,"
12473,CANTO XXXI,"Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler’s aim;"
12474,CANTO XXXI,"But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,"
12475,CANTO XXXI,"In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing’d.”"
12476,CANTO XXXI,
12477,CANTO XXXI,"I stood, as children silent and asham’d"
12478,CANTO XXXI,"Stand, list’ning, with their eyes upon the earth,"
12479,CANTO XXXI,Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn’d.
12480,CANTO XXXI,"And she resum’d: “If, but to hear thus pains thee,"
12481,CANTO XXXI,"Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!”"
12482,CANTO XXXI,
12483,CANTO XXXI,"With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,"
12484,CANTO XXXI,"Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows"
12485,CANTO XXXI,"From off the pole, or from Iarbas’ land,"
12486,CANTO XXXI,Than I at her behest my visage rais’d:
12487,CANTO XXXI,"And thus the face denoting by the beard,"
12488,CANTO XXXI,I mark’d the secret sting her words convey’d.
12489,CANTO XXXI,
12490,CANTO XXXI,"No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,"
12491,CANTO XXXI,Than downward sunk that vision I beheld
12492,CANTO XXXI,Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes
12493,CANTO XXXI,"Yet unassur’d and wavering, bent their light"
12494,CANTO XXXI,"On Beatrice. Towards the animal,"
12495,CANTO XXXI,"Who joins two natures in one form, she turn’d,"
12496,CANTO XXXI,"And, even under shadow of her veil,"
12497,CANTO XXXI,"And parted by the verdant rill, that flow’d"
12498,CANTO XXXI,"Between, in loveliness appear’d as much"
12499,CANTO XXXI,"Her former self surpassing, as on earth"
12500,CANTO XXXI,All others she surpass’d. Remorseful goads
12501,CANTO XXXI,"Shot sudden through me. Each thing else, the more"
12502,CANTO XXXI,"Its love had late beguil’d me, now the more"
12503,CANTO XXXI,I Was loathsome. On my heart so keenly smote
12504,CANTO XXXI,"The bitter consciousness, that on the ground"
12505,CANTO XXXI,"O’erpower’d I fell: and what my state was then,"
12506,CANTO XXXI,She knows who was the cause. When now my strength
12507,CANTO XXXI,"Flow’d back, returning outward from the heart,"
12508,CANTO XXXI,"The lady, whom alone I first had seen,"
12509,CANTO XXXI,"I found above me. “Loose me not,” she cried:"
12510,CANTO XXXI,“Loose not thy hold;” and lo! had dragg’d me high
12511,CANTO XXXI,"As to my neck into the stream, while she,"
12512,CANTO XXXI,"Still as she drew me after, swept along,"
12513,CANTO XXXI,"Swift as a shuttle, bounding o’er the wave."
12514,CANTO XXXI,
12515,CANTO XXXI,The blessed shore approaching then was heard
12516,CANTO XXXI,"So sweetly, “Tu asperges me,” that I"
12517,CANTO XXXI,"May not remember, much less tell the sound."
12518,CANTO XXXI,"The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp’d"
12519,CANTO XXXI,"My temples, and immerg’d me, where ’twas fit"
12520,CANTO XXXI,"The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,"
12521,CANTO XXXI,Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs
12522,CANTO XXXI,"Presented me so lav’d, and with their arm"
12523,CANTO XXXI,"They each did cover me. “Here are we nymphs,"
12524,CANTO XXXI,And in the heav’n are stars. Or ever earth
12525,CANTO XXXI,"Was visited of Beatrice, we"
12526,CANTO XXXI,"Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her."
12527,CANTO XXXI,We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light
12528,CANTO XXXI,"Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,"
12529,CANTO XXXI,"Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,"
12530,CANTO XXXI,Thy sight shall quicken.” Thus began their song;
12531,CANTO XXXI,"And then they led me to the Gryphon’s breast,"
12532,CANTO XXXI,"While, turn’d toward us, Beatrice stood."
12533,CANTO XXXI,“Spare not thy vision. We have stationed thee
12534,CANTO XXXI,"Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile"
12535,CANTO XXXI,"Hath drawn his weapons on thee. “As they spake,"
12536,CANTO XXXI,A thousand fervent wishes riveted
12537,CANTO XXXI,"Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood"
12538,CANTO XXXI,Still fix’d toward the Gryphon motionless.
12539,CANTO XXXI,"As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus"
12540,CANTO XXXI,"Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,"
12541,CANTO XXXI,"For ever varying, in one figure now"
12542,CANTO XXXI,"Reflected, now in other. Reader! muse"
12543,CANTO XXXI,How wond’rous in my sight it seem’d to mark
12544,CANTO XXXI,"A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,"
12545,CANTO XXXI,Yet in its imag’d semblance mutable.
12546,CANTO XXXI,
12547,CANTO XXXI,"Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul"
12548,CANTO XXXI,"Fed on the viand, whereof still desire"
12549,CANTO XXXI,"Grows with satiety, the other three"
12550,CANTO XXXI,"With gesture, that declar’d a loftier line,"
12551,CANTO XXXI,Advanc’d: to their own carol on they came
12552,CANTO XXXI,Dancing in festive ring angelical.
12553,CANTO XXXI,
12554,CANTO XXXI,"“Turn, Beatrice!” was their song: “O turn"
12555,CANTO XXXI,"Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,"
12556,CANTO XXXI,Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace
12557,CANTO XXXI,Hath measur’d. Gracious at our pray’r vouchsafe
12558,CANTO XXXI,Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark
12559,CANTO XXXI,"Thy second beauty, now conceal’d.” O splendour!"
12560,CANTO XXXI,O sacred light eternal! who is he
12561,CANTO XXXI,"So pale with musing in Pierian shades,"
12562,CANTO XXXI,"Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,"
12563,CANTO XXXI,Whose spirit should not fail him in th’ essay
12564,CANTO XXXI,"To represent thee such as thou didst seem,"
12565,CANTO XXXI,When under cope of the still-chiming heaven
12566,CANTO XXXI,Thou gav’st to open air thy charms reveal’d.
12567,CANTO XXXI,
12568,CANTO XXXI,
12569,CANTO XXXI,
12570,CANTO XXXI,
12571,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
12572,CANTO XXXII,
12573,CANTO XXXII,
12574,CANTO XXXII,"Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,"
12575,CANTO XXXII,"Were bent to rid them of their ten years’ thirst,"
12576,CANTO XXXII,No other sense was waking: and e’en they
12577,CANTO XXXII,Were fenc’d on either side from heed of aught;
12578,CANTO XXXII,So tangled in its custom’d toils that smile
12579,CANTO XXXII,"Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,"
12580,CANTO XXXII,When forcibly toward the left my sight
12581,CANTO XXXII,The sacred virgins turn’d; for from their lips
12582,CANTO XXXII,I heard the warning sounds: “Too fix’d a gaze!”
12583,CANTO XXXII,
12584,CANTO XXXII,Awhile my vision labor’d; as when late
12585,CANTO XXXII,Upon the’ o’erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:
12586,CANTO XXXII,"But soon to lesser object, as the view"
12587,CANTO XXXII,Was now recover’d (lesser in respect
12588,CANTO XXXII,"To that excess of sensible, whence late"
12589,CANTO XXXII,I had perforce been sunder’d) on their right
12590,CANTO XXXII,"I mark’d that glorious army wheel, and turn,"
12591,CANTO XXXII,"Against the sun and sev’nfold lights, their front."
12592,CANTO XXXII,"As when, their bucklers for protection rais’d,"
12593,CANTO XXXII,"A well-rang’d troop, with portly banners curl’d,"
12594,CANTO XXXII,"Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:"
12595,CANTO XXXII,E’en thus the goodly regiment of heav’n
12596,CANTO XXXII,"Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car"
12597,CANTO XXXII,Had slop’d his beam. Attendant at the wheels
12598,CANTO XXXII,The damsels turn’d; and on the Gryphon mov’d
12599,CANTO XXXII,"The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,"
12600,CANTO XXXII,No feather on him trembled. The fair dame
12601,CANTO XXXII,"Who through the wave had drawn me, companied"
12602,CANTO XXXII,"By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,"
12603,CANTO XXXII,"Whose orbit, rolling, mark’d a lesser arch."
12604,CANTO XXXII,
12605,CANTO XXXII,"Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,"
12606,CANTO XXXII,Who by the serpent was beguil’d) I past
12607,CANTO XXXII,With step in cadence to the harmony
12608,CANTO XXXII,"Angelic. Onward had we mov’d, as far"
12609,CANTO XXXII,Perchance as arrow at three several flights
12610,CANTO XXXII,"Full wing’d had sped, when from her station down"
12611,CANTO XXXII,Descended Beatrice. With one voice
12612,CANTO XXXII,"All murmur’d “Adam,” circling next a plant"
12613,CANTO XXXII,Despoil’d of flowers and leaf on every bough.
12614,CANTO XXXII,"Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,"
12615,CANTO XXXII,"Were such, as ’midst their forest wilds for height"
12616,CANTO XXXII,The Indians might have gaz’d at. “Blessed thou!
12617,CANTO XXXII,"Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck’d that tree"
12618,CANTO XXXII,Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite
12619,CANTO XXXII,Was warp’d to evil.” Round the stately trunk
12620,CANTO XXXII,"Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return’d"
12621,CANTO XXXII,The animal twice-gender’d: “Yea: for so
12622,CANTO XXXII,The generation of the just are sav’d.”
12623,CANTO XXXII,"And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot"
12624,CANTO XXXII,"He drew it of the widow’d branch, and bound"
12625,CANTO XXXII,There left unto the stock whereon it grew.
12626,CANTO XXXII,
12627,CANTO XXXII,As when large floods of radiance from above
12628,CANTO XXXII,"Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends"
12629,CANTO XXXII,"Next after setting of the scaly sign,"
12630,CANTO XXXII,"Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew"
12631,CANTO XXXII,"His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok’d"
12632,CANTO XXXII,Beneath another star his flamy steeds;
12633,CANTO XXXII,"Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,"
12634,CANTO XXXII,"And deeper than the violet, was renew’d"
12635,CANTO XXXII,"The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare."
12636,CANTO XXXII,
12637,CANTO XXXII,"Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose."
12638,CANTO XXXII,"I understood it not, nor to the end"
12639,CANTO XXXII,Endur’d the harmony. Had I the skill
12640,CANTO XXXII,"To pencil forth, how clos’d th’ unpitying eyes"
12641,CANTO XXXII,"Slumb’ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid"
12642,CANTO XXXII,"So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,"
12643,CANTO XXXII,"That with a model paints, I might design"
12644,CANTO XXXII,The manner of my falling into sleep.
12645,CANTO XXXII,But feign who will the slumber cunningly;
12646,CANTO XXXII,"I pass it by to when I wak’d, and tell"
12647,CANTO XXXII,How suddenly a flash of splendour rent
12648,CANTO XXXII,"The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:"
12649,CANTO XXXII,"“Arise, what dost thou?” As the chosen three,"
12650,CANTO XXXII,"On Tabor’s mount, admitted to behold"
12651,CANTO XXXII,"The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit"
12652,CANTO XXXII,"Is coveted of angels, and doth make"
12653,CANTO XXXII,"Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves"
12654,CANTO XXXII,"Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps"
12655,CANTO XXXII,"Were broken, that they their tribe diminish’d saw,"
12656,CANTO XXXII,"Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang’d"
12657,CANTO XXXII,The stole their master wore: thus to myself
12658,CANTO XXXII,"Returning, over me beheld I stand"
12659,CANTO XXXII,"The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought"
12660,CANTO XXXII,"My steps. “And where,” all doubting, I exclaim’d,"
12661,CANTO XXXII,"“Is Beatrice?”—“See her,” she replied,"
12662,CANTO XXXII,“Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.
12663,CANTO XXXII,Behold th’ associate choir that circles her.
12664,CANTO XXXII,"The others, with a melody more sweet"
12665,CANTO XXXII,"And more profound, journeying to higher realms,"
12666,CANTO XXXII,Upon the Gryphon tend.” If there her words
12667,CANTO XXXII,"Were clos’d, I know not; but mine eyes had now"
12668,CANTO XXXII,"Ta’en view of her, by whom all other thoughts"
12669,CANTO XXXII,Were barr’d admittance. On the very ground
12670,CANTO XXXII,"Alone she sat, as she had there been left"
12671,CANTO XXXII,"A guard upon the wain, which I beheld"
12672,CANTO XXXII,Bound to the twyform beast. The seven nymphs
12673,CANTO XXXII,"Did make themselves a cloister round about her,"
12674,CANTO XXXII,And in their hands upheld those lights secure
12675,CANTO XXXII,From blast septentrion and the gusty south.
12676,CANTO XXXII,
12677,CANTO XXXII,“A little while thou shalt be forester here:
12678,CANTO XXXII,"And citizen shalt be forever with me,"
12679,CANTO XXXII,"Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman"
12680,CANTO XXXII,"To profit the misguided world, keep now"
12681,CANTO XXXII,"Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,"
12682,CANTO XXXII,"Take heed thou write, returning to that place.”"
12683,CANTO XXXII,
12684,CANTO XXXII,Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin’d
12685,CANTO XXXII,"Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,"
12686,CANTO XXXII,"I, as she bade, directed. Never fire,"
12687,CANTO XXXII,"With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud"
12688,CANTO XXXII,"Leap’d downward from the welkin’s farthest bound,"
12689,CANTO XXXII,As I beheld the bird of Jove descending
12690,CANTO XXXII,"Pounce on the tree, and, as he rush’d, the rind,"
12691,CANTO XXXII,"Disparting crush beneath him, buds much more"
12692,CANTO XXXII,And leaflets. On the car with all his might
12693,CANTO XXXII,"He struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel’d,"
12694,CANTO XXXII,"At random driv’n, to starboard now, o’ercome,"
12695,CANTO XXXII,"And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves."
12696,CANTO XXXII,
12697,CANTO XXXII,Next springing up into the chariot’s womb
12698,CANTO XXXII,"A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin’d"
12699,CANTO XXXII,"Of all good food. But, for his ugly sins"
12700,CANTO XXXII,"The saintly maid rebuking him, away"
12701,CANTO XXXII,"Scamp’ring he turn’d, fast as his hide-bound corpse"
12702,CANTO XXXII,"Would bear him. Next, from whence before he came,"
12703,CANTO XXXII,I saw the eagle dart into the hull
12704,CANTO XXXII,"O’ th’ car, and leave it with his feathers lin’d;"
12705,CANTO XXXII,"And then a voice, like that which issues forth"
12706,CANTO XXXII,"From heart with sorrow riv’d, did issue forth"
12707,CANTO XXXII,"From heav’n, and, “O poor bark of mine!” it cried,"
12708,CANTO XXXII,"“How badly art thou freighted!” Then, it seem’d,"
12709,CANTO XXXII,"That the earth open’d between either wheel,"
12710,CANTO XXXII,"And I beheld a dragon issue thence,"
12711,CANTO XXXII,That through the chariot fix’d his forked train;
12712,CANTO XXXII,"And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,"
12713,CANTO XXXII,"So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg’d"
12714,CANTO XXXII,"Part of the bottom forth, and went his way"
12715,CANTO XXXII,"Exulting. What remain’d, as lively turf"
12716,CANTO XXXII,"With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,"
12717,CANTO XXXII,Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind
12718,CANTO XXXII,"Been offer’d; and therewith were cloth’d the wheels,"
12719,CANTO XXXII,"Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly"
12720,CANTO XXXII,"A sigh were not breath’d sooner. Thus transform’d,"
12721,CANTO XXXII,"The holy structure, through its several parts,"
12722,CANTO XXXII,"Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one"
12723,CANTO XXXII,"On every side; the first like oxen horn’d,"
12724,CANTO XXXII,But with a single horn upon their front
12725,CANTO XXXII,The four. Like monster sight hath never seen.
12726,CANTO XXXII,"O’er it methought there sat, secure as rock"
12727,CANTO XXXII,"On mountain’s lofty top, a shameless whore,"
12728,CANTO XXXII,"Whose ken rov’d loosely round her. At her side,"
12729,CANTO XXXII,"As ’twere that none might bear her off, I saw"
12730,CANTO XXXII,"A giant stand; and ever, and anon"
12731,CANTO XXXII,"They mingled kisses. But, her lustful eyes"
12732,CANTO XXXII,"Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion"
12733,CANTO XXXII,Scourg’d her from head to foot all o’er; then full
12734,CANTO XXXII,"Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos’d"
12735,CANTO XXXII,"The monster, and dragg’d on, so far across"
12736,CANTO XXXII,"The forest, that from me its shades alone"
12737,CANTO XXXII,Shielded the harlot and the new-form’d brute.
12738,CANTO XXXII,
12739,CANTO XXXII,
12740,CANTO XXXII,
12741,CANTO XXXII,
12742,CANTO XXXIII,CANTO XXXIII
12743,CANTO XXXIII,
12744,CANTO XXXIII,
12745,CANTO XXXIII,"“The heathen, Lord! are come!” responsive thus,"
12746,CANTO XXXIII,"The trinal now, and now the virgin band"
12747,CANTO XXXIII,"Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,"
12748,CANTO XXXIII,"Weeping; and Beatrice listen’d, sad"
12749,CANTO XXXIII,"And sighing, to the song’, in such a mood,"
12750,CANTO XXXIII,"That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,"
12751,CANTO XXXIII,Was scarce more chang’d. But when they gave her place
12752,CANTO XXXIII,"To speak, then, risen upright on her feet,"
12753,CANTO XXXIII,"She, with a colour glowing bright as fire,"
12754,CANTO XXXIII,"Did answer: “Yet a little while, and ye"
12755,CANTO XXXIII,"Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,"
12756,CANTO XXXIII,"Again a little while, and ye shall see me.”"
12757,CANTO XXXIII,
12758,CANTO XXXIII,"Before her then she marshall’d all the seven,"
12759,CANTO XXXIII,"And, beck’ning only motion’d me, the dame,"
12760,CANTO XXXIII,"And that remaining sage, to follow her."
12761,CANTO XXXIII,
12762,CANTO XXXIII,"So on she pass’d; and had not set, I ween,"
12763,CANTO XXXIII,"Her tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes"
12764,CANTO XXXIII,"Her eyes encounter’d; and, with visage mild,"
12765,CANTO XXXIII,"“So mend thy pace,” she cried, “that if my words"
12766,CANTO XXXIII,"Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac’d"
12767,CANTO XXXIII,To hear them.” Soon as duly to her side
12768,CANTO XXXIII,"I now had hasten’d: “Brother!” she began,"
12769,CANTO XXXIII,"“Why mak’st thou no attempt at questioning,"
12770,CANTO XXXIII,As thus we walk together?” Like to those
12771,CANTO XXXIII,"Who, speaking with too reverent an awe"
12772,CANTO XXXIII,"Before their betters, draw not forth the voice"
12773,CANTO XXXIII,"Alive unto their lips, befell me shell"
12774,CANTO XXXIII,That I in sounds imperfect thus began:
12775,CANTO XXXIII,"“Lady! what I have need of, that thou know’st,"
12776,CANTO XXXIII,And what will suit my need.” She answering thus:
12777,CANTO XXXIII,"“Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou"
12778,CANTO XXXIII,"Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,"
12779,CANTO XXXIII,As one who dreams. Thus far be taught of me:
12780,CANTO XXXIII,"The vessel, which thou saw’st the serpent break,"
12781,CANTO XXXIII,"Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,"
12782,CANTO XXXIII,Hope not to scare God’s vengeance with a sop.
12783,CANTO XXXIII,Without an heir for ever shall not be
12784,CANTO XXXIII,"That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum’d,"
12785,CANTO XXXIII,Which monster made it first and next a prey.
12786,CANTO XXXIII,"Plainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars"
12787,CANTO XXXIII,"E’en now approaching, whose conjunction, free"
12788,CANTO XXXIII,"From all impediment and bar, brings on"
12789,CANTO XXXIII,"A season, in the which, one sent from God,"
12790,CANTO XXXIII,"(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)"
12791,CANTO XXXIII,"That foul one, and th’ accomplice of her guilt,"
12792,CANTO XXXIII,"The giant, both shall slay. And if perchance"
12793,CANTO XXXIII,"My saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,"
12794,CANTO XXXIII,"Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils"
12795,CANTO XXXIII,The intellect with blindness) yet ere long
12796,CANTO XXXIII,"Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve"
12797,CANTO XXXIII,"This knotty riddle, and no damage light"
12798,CANTO XXXIII,On flock or field. Take heed; and as these words
12799,CANTO XXXIII,"By me are utter’d, teach them even so"
12800,CANTO XXXIII,"To those who live that life, which is a race"
12801,CANTO XXXIII,"To death: and when thou writ’st them, keep in mind"
12802,CANTO XXXIII,"Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,"
12803,CANTO XXXIII,"That twice hath now been spoil’d. This whoso robs,"
12804,CANTO XXXIII,"This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed"
12805,CANTO XXXIII,"Sins against God, who for his use alone"
12806,CANTO XXXIII,"Creating hallow’d it. For taste of this,"
12807,CANTO XXXIII,"In pain and in desire, five thousand years"
12808,CANTO XXXIII,"And upward, the first soul did yearn for him,"
12809,CANTO XXXIII,Who punish’d in himself the fatal gust.
12810,CANTO XXXIII,
12811,CANTO XXXIII,"“Thy reason slumbers, if it deem this height"
12812,CANTO XXXIII,"And summit thus inverted of the plant,"
12813,CANTO XXXIII,"Without due cause: and were not vainer thoughts,"
12814,CANTO XXXIII,"As Elsa’s numbing waters, to thy soul,"
12815,CANTO XXXIII,And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark
12816,CANTO XXXIII,"As Pyramus the mulberry, thou hadst seen,"
12817,CANTO XXXIII,"In such momentous circumstance alone,"
12818,CANTO XXXIII,God’s equal justice morally implied
12819,CANTO XXXIII,In the forbidden tree. But since I mark thee
12820,CANTO XXXIII,"In understanding harden’d into stone,"
12821,CANTO XXXIII,"And, to that hardness, spotted too and stain’d,"
12822,CANTO XXXIII,"So that thine eye is dazzled at my word,"
12823,CANTO XXXIII,"I will, that, if not written, yet at least"
12824,CANTO XXXIII,"Painted thou take it in thee, for the cause,"
12825,CANTO XXXIII,That one brings home his staff inwreath’d with palm.
12826,CANTO XXXIII,
12827,CANTO XXXIII,"“I thus: “As wax by seal, that changeth not"
12828,CANTO XXXIII,"Its impress, now is stamp’d my brain by thee."
12829,CANTO XXXIII,But wherefore soars thy wish’d-for speech so high
12830,CANTO XXXIII,"Beyond my sight, that loses it the more,"
12831,CANTO XXXIII,The more it strains to reach it?”—“To the end
12832,CANTO XXXIII,"That thou mayst know,” she answer’d straight, “the school,"
12833,CANTO XXXIII,"That thou hast follow’d; and how far behind,"
12834,CANTO XXXIII,"When following my discourse, its learning halts:"
12835,CANTO XXXIII,"And mayst behold your art, from the divine"
12836,CANTO XXXIII,"As distant, as the disagreement is"
12837,CANTO XXXIII,’Twixt earth and heaven’s most high and rapturous orb.”
12838,CANTO XXXIII,
12839,CANTO XXXIII,"“I not remember,” I replied, “that e’er"
12840,CANTO XXXIII,"I was estrang’d from thee, nor for such fault"
12841,CANTO XXXIII,Doth conscience chide me.” Smiling she return’d:
12842,CANTO XXXIII,"“If thou canst, not remember, call to mind"
12843,CANTO XXXIII,How lately thou hast drunk of Lethe’s wave;
12844,CANTO XXXIII,"And, sure as smoke doth indicate a flame,"
12845,CANTO XXXIII,In that forgetfulness itself conclude
12846,CANTO XXXIII,Blame from thy alienated will incurr’d.
12847,CANTO XXXIII,From henceforth verily my words shall be
12848,CANTO XXXIII,As naked as will suit them to appear
12849,CANTO XXXIII,"In thy unpractis’d view.” More sparkling now,"
12850,CANTO XXXIII,And with retarded course the sun possess’d
12851,CANTO XXXIII,"The circle of mid-day, that varies still"
12852,CANTO XXXIII,"As th’ aspect varies of each several clime,"
12853,CANTO XXXIII,"When, as one, sent in vaward of a troop"
12854,CANTO XXXIII,"For escort, pauses, if perchance he spy"
12855,CANTO XXXIII,Vestige of somewhat strange and rare: so paus’d
12856,CANTO XXXIII,"The sev’nfold band, arriving at the verge"
12857,CANTO XXXIII,"Of a dun umbrage hoar, such as is seen,"
12858,CANTO XXXIII,"Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches, oft"
12859,CANTO XXXIII,To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff.
12860,CANTO XXXIII,"And, where they stood, before them, as it seem’d,"
12861,CANTO XXXIII,"Tigris and Euphrates both beheld,"
12862,CANTO XXXIII,"Forth from one fountain issue; and, like friends,"
12863,CANTO XXXIII,Linger at parting. “O enlight’ning beam!
12864,CANTO XXXIII,O glory of our kind! beseech thee say
12865,CANTO XXXIII,"What water this, which from one source deriv’d"
12866,CANTO XXXIII,Itself removes to distance from itself?”
12867,CANTO XXXIII,
12868,CANTO XXXIII,To such entreaty answer thus was made:
12869,CANTO XXXIII,"“Entreat Matilda, that she teach thee this.”"
12870,CANTO XXXIII,
12871,CANTO XXXIII,"And here, as one, who clears himself of blame"

13071,CANTO IV,"obscure. Bellutello refers, for an elucidation of it, to the reasoning"
13072,CANTO IV,of Statius in the twenty-fifth canto. Perhaps some illustration may be
13073,CANTO IV,"derived from the following, passage in South’s Sermons, in which I have"
13074,CANTO IV,ventured to supply the words between crotchets that seemed to be
13075,CANTO IV,"wanting to complete the sense. Now whether these three, judgement"
13076,CANTO IV,"memory, and invention, are three distinct things, both in being"
13077,CANTO IV,"distinguished from one another, and likewise from the substance of the"
13078,CANTO IV,"soul itself, considered without any such faculties, (or whether the"
13079,CANTO IV,soul be one individual substance) but only receiving these several
13080,CANTO IV,denominations rom the several respects arising from the several actions
13081,CANTO IV,"exerted immediately by itself upon several objects, or several"
13082,CANTO IV,"qualities of the same object, I say whether of these it is, is not easy"
13083,CANTO IV,"to decide, and it is well that it is not necessary Aquinas, and most"
13084,CANTO IV,"with him, affirm the former, and Scotus with his followers the latter.”"

13167,CANTO VI,"by Ghino, in an apartment of his own house, in the presence of many"
13168,CANTO VI,"witnesses. Ghino was not only suffered to escape in safety, but (as the"
13169,CANTO VI,commentators inform us) obtained so high a reputation by the liberality
13170,CANTO VI,"with which he was accustomed to dispense the fruits of his plunder, and"
13171,CANTO VI,"treated those who fell into his hands with so much courtesy, that he"
13172,CANTO VI,"was afterwards invited to Rome, and knighted by Boniface VIII. A story"
13173,CANTO VI,"is told of him by Boccaccio, G. x. N. 2."

13177,CANTO VI,was in pursuit of certain of his enemies.

13180,CANTO VI,slain by one of the family of Bostoli.

13183,CANTO VI,"Marzuco, who had entered the order of the Frati Minori, so entirely"
13184,CANTO VI,"overcame the feelings of resentment, that he even kissed the hands of"

13192,CANTO VI,"courtiers, envying the high place which he held in the king’s favour,"
13193,CANTO VI,prevailed on Mary of Brabant to charge him falsely with an attempt upon
13194,CANTO VI,her person for which supposed crime he suffered death. So say the
13195,CANTO VI,Italian commentators. Henault represents the matter very differently:
13196,CANTO VI,"“Pierre de la Brosse, formerly barber to St. Louis, afterwards the"
13197,CANTO VI,"favorite of Philip, fearing the too great attachment of the king for"
13198,CANTO VI,"his wife Mary, accuses this princess of having poisoned Louis, eldest"
13199,CANTO VI,"son of Philip, by his first marriage. This calumny is discovered by a"

13212,CANTO VI,obscurity of romance. That he distinguished himself by his skill in
13213,CANTO VI,Provencal poetry is certain. It is probable that he was born towards
13214,CANTO VI,"the end of the twelfth, and died about the middle of the succeeding"
13215,CANTO VI,century. Tiraboschi has taken much pains to sift all the notices he
13216,CANTO VI,could collect relating to him. Honourable mention of his name is made
13217,CANTO VI,by our Poet in the Treatise de Vulg. Eloq. 1. i. c. 15.
13218,CANTO VI,
13219,CANTO VI,v. 76. Thou inn of grief.]

13222,CANTO VI,"Shakespeare, Richard II a. 5. s. 1."
13223,CANTO VI,
13224,CANTO VI,v. 89. Justinian’s hand.] “What avails it that Justinian delivered thee
13225,CANTO VI,"from the Goths, and reformed thy laws, if thou art no longer under the"
13226,CANTO VI,control of his successors in the empire?”
13227,CANTO VI,
13228,CANTO VI,v. 94. That which God commands.] He alludes to the precept- “Render
13229,CANTO VI,unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s.”
13230,CANTO VI,
13231,CANTO VI,v. 98. O German Albert!] The Emperor Albert I. succeeded Adolphus in

13233,CANTO VI,"successor.] The successor of Albert was Henry of Luxembourg, by whose"
13234,CANTO VI,interposition in the affairs of Italy our Poet hoped to have been
13235,CANTO VI,reinstated in his native city.
13236,CANTO VI,
13237,CANTO VI,"v. 101. Thy sire.] The Emperor Rodolph, too intent on increasing his"

13239,CANTO VI,the empire.”
13240,CANTO VI,
13241,CANTO VI,v. 107. Capulets and Montagues.] Our ears are so familiarized to the
13242,CANTO VI,"names of these rival families in the language of Shakespeare, that I"
13243,CANTO VI,have used them instead of the “Montecchi” and “Cappelletti.”

13246,CANTO VI,
13247,CANTO VI,"v. 113. What safety, Santafiore can supply.] A place between Pisa and"
13248,CANTO VI,"Sienna. What he alludes to is so doubtful, that it is not certain"
13249,CANTO VI,whether we should not read “come si cura”—” How Santafiore is
13250,CANTO VI,"governed.” Perhaps the event related in the note to v. 58, Canto XI."
13251,CANTO VI,may be pointed at.
13252,CANTO VI,
13253,CANTO VI,v. 127. Marcellus.]

13687,CANTO XIV,"so admirably paraphrased from Boccaccio, was of the former: her lover"
13688,CANTO XIV,and the specter were of the Anastagi family.
13689,CANTO XIV,
13690,CANTO XIV,"v. 111. The ladies, &c.] These two lines express the true spirit of"
13691,CANTO XIV,chivalry. “Agi” is understood by the commentators whom I have
13692,CANTO XIV,"consulted,to mean “the ease procured for others by the exertions of"
13693,CANTO XIV,knight-errantry.” But surely it signifies the alternation of ease with
13694,CANTO XIV,labour.

13806,CANTO XVI,"beauty of her person, and the excellency of her talents. Gaia, says"

13814,CANTO XVII,"v. 21. The bird, that most Delights itself in song.] I cannot think"
13815,CANTO XVII,"with Vellutello, that the swallow is here meant. Dante probably alludes"
13816,CANTO XVII,"to the story of Philomela, as it is found in Homer’s Odyssey, b. xix."
13817,CANTO XVII,518 rather than as later poets have told it. “She intended to slay the
13818,CANTO XVII,"son of her husband’s brother Amphion, incited to it, by the envy of his"
13819,CANTO XVII,"wife, who had six children, while herself had only two, but through"
13820,CANTO XVII,"mistake slew her own son Itylus, and for her punishment was transformed"
13821,CANTO XVII,by Jupiter into a nightingale.” Cowper’s note on the passage. In
13822,CANTO XVII,"speaking of the nightingale, let me observe, that while some have"
13823,CANTO XVII,"considered its song as a melancholy, and others as a cheerful one,"
13824,CANTO XVII,"Chiabrera appears to have come nearest the truth, when he says, in the"

13853,CANTO XVII,"or to hate the First Cause of all, by which it exists. We can therefore"
13854,CANTO XVII,only rejoice in the evil which befalls others.”

13861,CANTO XVII,
13862,CANTO XVII,v. 135. Along Three circles.] According to the allegorical
13863,CANTO XVII,"commentators, as Venturi has observed, Reason is represented under the"
13864,CANTO XVII,"person of Virgil, and Sense under that of Dante. The former leaves to"
13865,CANTO XVII,"the latter to discover for itself the three carnal sins, avarice,"
13866,CANTO XVII,gluttony and libidinousness; having already declared the nature of the
13867,CANTO XVII,"spiritual sins, pride, envy, anger, and indifference, or lukewarmness"

13880,CANTO XVIII,"intention within you, so that it makes the soul turn to it.” The"
13881,CANTO XVIII,commentators labour in explaining this; and whatever sense they have

14134,CANTO XXII,"had placed Manto, the daughter of Tiresias, among the sorcerers. See"
14135,CANTO XXII,"Hell Canto XX. Vellutello endeavours, rather awkwardly, to reconcile"
14136,CANTO XXII,"the inconsistency, by observing, that although she was placed there as"
14137,CANTO XXII,"a sinner, yet, as one of famous memory, she had also a place among the"

14188,CANTO XXIII,v. 91. The’ unblushing domes of Florence.] Landino’s note exhibits a
14189,CANTO XXIII,curious instance of the changeableness of his countrywomen. He even
14190,CANTO XXIII,"goes beyond the acrimony of the original. “In those days,” says the"
14191,CANTO XXIII,"commentator, “no less than in ours, the Florentine ladies exposed the"
14192,CANTO XXIII,"neck and bosom, a dress, no doubt, more suitable to a harlot than a"
14193,CANTO XXIII,"matron. But, as they changed soon after, insomuch that they wore"
14194,CANTO XXIII,"collars up to the chin, covering the whole of the neck and throat, so"
14195,CANTO XXIII,have I hopes they will change again; not indeed so much from motives of
14196,CANTO XXIII,"decency, as through that fickleness, which pervades every action of"
14197,CANTO XXIII,their lives.”

14238,CANTO XXIV,"v. 56. The Notary.] Jucopo da Lentino, called the Notary, a poet of"
14239,CANTO XXIV,"these times. He was probably an Apulian: for Dante, (De Vulg. Eloq. I."
14240,CANTO XXIV,i. c 12.) quoting a verse which belongs to a canzone of his published
14241,CANTO XXIV,"by the Giunti, without mentioning the writer’s name, terms him one of"
14242,CANTO XXIV,"“the illustrious Apulians,” praefulgentes Apuli. See Tiraboschi, Mr."

14244,CANTO XXIV,"72. 4to. ed. 1698) gives an extract from one of his poems, printed in"
14245,CANTO XXIV,"Allacci’s Collection, to show that the whimsical compositions called"
14246,CANTO XXIV,“Ariette “ are not of modern invention.
14247,CANTO XXIV,
14248,CANTO XXIV,"v. 56. Guittone.] Fra Guittone, of Arezzo, holds a distinguished place"
14249,CANTO XXIV,"in Italian literature, as besides his poems printed in the collection"
14250,CANTO XXIV,"of the Giunti, he has left a collection of letters, forty in number,"
14251,CANTO XXIV,which afford the earliest specimen of that kind of writing in the
14252,CANTO XXIV,"language. They were published at Rome in 1743, with learned"
14253,CANTO XXIV,illustrations by Giovanni Bottari. He was also the first who gave to
14254,CANTO XXIV,"the sonnet its regular and legitimate form, a species of composition in"
14255,CANTO XXIV,"which not only his own countrymen, but many of the best poets in all"
14256,CANTO XXIV,"the cultivated languages of modern Europe, have since so much"
14257,CANTO XXIV,delighted.
14258,CANTO XXIV,
14259,CANTO XXIV,"Guittone, a native of Arezzo, was the son of Viva di Michele. He was of"
14260,CANTO XXIV,"the order of the “ Frati Godenti,” of which an account may be seen in"
14261,CANTO XXIV,"the Notes to Hell, Canto XXIII. In the year 1293, he founded a"
14262,CANTO XXIV,"monastery of the order of Camaldoli, in Florence, and died in the"
14263,CANTO XXIV,"following year. Tiraboschi, Ibid. p. 119. Dante, in the Treatise de"
14264,CANTO XXIV,"Vulg. Eloq. 1. i. c. 13, and 1. ii. c. 6., blames him for preferring"

14271,CANTO XXIV,aiming at the sovereignty of Florence. To escape the fury of his fellow
14272,CANTO XXIV,"citizens, he fled away on horseback, but failing, was overtaken and"
14273,CANTO XXIV,"slain, A.D. 1308. The contemporary annalist, after relating at length"
14274,CANTO XXIV,"the circumstances of his fate, adds, “that he was one of the wisest and"
14275,CANTO XXIV,"most valorous knights the best speaker, the most expert statesman, the"
14276,CANTO XXIV,"most renowned and enterprising, man of his age in Italy, a comely"
14277,CANTO XXIV,"knight and of graceful carriage, but very worldly, and in his time had"

14294,CANTO XXV,c. 5. for the opinion that there is only one universal intellect or
14295,CANTO XXV,mind pervading every individual of the human race. Much of the

14302,CANTO XXV,"discovery of Galileo’s in natural philosophy, but it is in reality"
14303,CANTO XXV,"taken from a passage in Cicero “de Senectute,” where, speaking of the"

14318,CANTO XXVI,
14319,CANTO XXVI,"v. 87. lycurgus.] Statius, Theb. 1. iv. and v. Hypsipile had left her"
14320,CANTO XXVI,"infant charge, the son of Lycurgus, on a bank, where it was destroyed"
14321,CANTO XXVI,"by a serpent, when she went to show the Argive army the river of"
14322,CANTO XXVI,"Langia: and, on her escaping the effects of Lycurgus’s resentment, the"
14323,CANTO XXVI,joy her own children felt at the sight of her was such as our Poet felt
14324,CANTO XXVI,on beholding his predecessor Guinicelli.
14325,CANTO XXVI,
14326,CANTO XXVI,"The incidents are beautifully described in Statius, and seem to have"
14327,CANTO XXVI,"made an impression on Dante, for he again (Canto XXII. 110.)"
14328,CANTO XXVI,"characterizes Hypsipile, as her- Who show’d Langia’s wave."
14329,CANTO XXVI,
14330,CANTO XXVI,"v. 111. He.] The united testimony of Dante, and of Petrarch, in his"
14331,CANTO XXVI,"Triumph of Love, e. iv. places Arnault Daniel at the head of the"
14332,CANTO XXVI,"Provencal poets. That he was born of poor but noble parents, at the"
14333,CANTO XXVI,"castle of Ribeyrae in Perigord, and that he was at the English court,"
14334,CANTO XXVI,is the amount of Millot’s information concerning him (t. ii. p. 479).
14335,CANTO XXVI,
14336,CANTO XXVI,"The account there given of his writings is not much more satisfactory,"
14337,CANTO XXVI,and the criticism on them must go for little better than nothing.

14345,CANTO XXVI,"According to Crescimbeni, (Della Volg. Poes. 1. 1. p. 7. ed. 1698.) He"
14346,CANTO XXVI,died in 1189.

14348,CANTO XXVI,"v. 113. The songster of Limoges.] Giraud de Borneil, of Sideuil, a"

14350,CANTO XXVI,"his day, and appears to have been in favour with the monarchs of"

14360,CANTO XXVI,
14361,CANTO XXVI,"v. 132. Thy courtesy.] Arnault is here made to speak in his own tongue,"
14362,CANTO XXVI,"the Provencal. According to Dante, (De Vulg. Eloq. 1. 1. c. 8.) the"
14363,CANTO XXVI,Provencal was one language with the Spanish. What he says on this
14364,CANTO XXVI,"subject is so curious, that the reader will perhaps not be displeased"
14365,CANTO XXVI,it I give an abstract of it.
14366,CANTO XXVI,
14367,CANTO XXVI,He first makes three great divisions of the European languages. “One of
14368,CANTO XXVI,"these extends from the mouths of the Danube, or the lake of Maeotis, to"
14369,CANTO XXVI,"the western limits of England, and is bounded by the limits of the"
14370,CANTO XXVI,"French and Italians, and by the ocean. One idiom obtained over the"
14371,CANTO XXVI,"whole of this space: but was afterwards subdivided into, the"
14372,CANTO XXVI,"Sclavonian, Hungarian, Teutonic, Saxon, English, and the vernacular"
14373,CANTO XXVI,"tongues of several other people, one sign remaining to all, that they"
14374,CANTO XXVI,"use the affirmative io, (our English ay.) The whole of Europe,"
14375,CANTO XXVI,"beginning from the Hungarian limits and stretching towards the east,"
14376,CANTO XXVI,has a second idiom which reaches still further than the end of Europe
14377,CANTO XXVI,"into Asia. This is the Greek. In all that remains of Europe, there is a"
14378,CANTO XXVI,"third idiom subdivided into three dialects, which may be severally"
14379,CANTO XXVI,"distinguished by the use of the affirmatives, oc, oil, and si; the"
14380,CANTO XXVI,"first spoken by the Spaniards, the next by the French, and the third by"
14381,CANTO XXVI,the Latins (or Italians). The first occupy the western part of southern
14382,CANTO XXVI,"Europe, beginning from the limits of the Genoese. The third occupy the"
14383,CANTO XXVI,"eastern part from the said limits, as far, that is, as the promontory"
14384,CANTO XXVI,"of Italy, where the Adriatic sea begins, and to Sicily. The second are"
14385,CANTO XXVI,in a manner northern with respect to these for they have the Germans to
14386,CANTO XXVI,"the east and north, on the west they are bounded by the English sea,"
14387,CANTO XXVI,"and the mountains of Arragon, and on the south by the people of"
14388,CANTO XXVI,Provence and the declivity of the Apennine.” Ibid. c. x. “Each of these
14389,CANTO XXVI,"three,” he observes, “has its own claims to distinction The excellency"
14390,CANTO XXVI,"of the French language consists in its being best adapted, on account"
14391,CANTO XXVI,"of its facility and agreeableness, to prose narration, (quicquid"
14392,CANTO XXVI,"redactum, sive inventum est ad vulgare prosaicum suum est); and he"
14393,CANTO XXVI,instances the books compiled on the gests of the Trojans and Romans and
14394,CANTO XXVI,"the delightful adventures of King Arthur, with many other histories and"
14395,CANTO XXVI,works of instruction. The Spanish (or Provencal) may boast of its
14396,CANTO XXVI,having produced such as first cultivated in this as in a more perfect
14397,CANTO XXVI,"and sweet language, the vernacular poetry: among whom are Pierre"
14398,CANTO XXVI,"d’Auvergne, and others more ancient. The privileges of the Latin, or"
14399,CANTO XXVI,Italian are two: first that it may reckon for its own those writers who
14400,CANTO XXVI,"have adopted a more sweet and subtle style of poetry, in the number of"
14401,CANTO XXVI,"whom are Cino, da Pistoia and his friend, and the next, that its"
14402,CANTO XXVI,"writers seem to adhere to, certain general rules of grammar, and in so"
14403,CANTO XXVI,"doing give it, in the opinion of the intelligent, a very weighty"
14404,CANTO XXVI,pretension to preference.”

14418,CANTO XXVII,latter looks. Michel Angelo has made these allegorical personages the

14443,CANTO XXVIII,"who in the last Canto is called Matilda, is to be understood the"
14444,CANTO XXVIII,"Countess Matilda, who endowed the holy see with the estates called the"
14445,CANTO XXVIII,"Patrimony of St. Peter, and died in 1115. See G. Villani, 1. iv. e. 20"

14462,CANTO XXIX,
14463,CANTO XXIX,v. 79. Ten paces.] For an explanation of the allegorical meaning of
14464,CANTO XXIX,"this mysterious procession, Venturi refers those “who would see in the"
14465,CANTO XXIX,"dark” to the commentaries of Landino, Vellutello, and others: and adds"
14466,CANTO XXIX,that it is evident the Poet has accommodated to his own fancy many
14467,CANTO XXIX,"sacred images in the Apocalypse. In Vasari’s Life of Giotto, we learn"

14498,CANTO XXIX,"v. 138. Four others.] “The commentators,” says Venturi; “suppose these"
14499,CANTO XXIX,"four to be the four evangelists, but I should rather take them to be"
14500,CANTO XXIX,four principal doctors of the church.” Yet both Landino and Vellutello
14501,CANTO XXIX,"expressly call them the authors of the epistles, James, Peter, John and"
14502,CANTO XXIX,Jude.
14503,CANTO XXIX,
14504,CANTO XXIX,"v. 140. One single old man.] As some say, St. John, under his character"
14505,CANTO XXIX,"of the author of the Apocalypse. But in the poem attributed to Giacopo,"
14506,CANTO XXIX,"the son of our Poet, which in some MSS, accompanies the original of"
14507,CANTO XXIX,"this work, and is descriptive of its plan, this old man is said to be"

14543,I. 23.,"off Africa, where, at the time of the equinox, bodies being under the"
14544,I. 23.,"equator cast little or no shadow; or, in other words, when the wind is"
14545,I. 23.,south.”
14546,I. 23.,
14547,I. 23.,"v. 98. The ice.] Milton has transferred this conceit, though scarcely"
14548,I. 23.,"worth the pains of removing, into one of his Italian poems, son."

14550,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
14551,CANTO XXXI,
14552,CANTO XXXI,
14553,CANTO XXXI,"v. 3. With lateral edge.] The words of Beatrice, when not addressed"
14554,CANTO XXXI,"directly to himself, but speaking to the angel of hell, Dante had"
14555,CANTO XXXI,thought sufficiently harsh.
14556,CANTO XXXI,
14557,CANTO XXXI,v. 39. Counter to the edge.] “The weapons of divine justice are blunted
14558,CANTO XXXI,by the confession and sorrow of the offender.”

14562,CANTO XXXI,v. 69. From Iarbas’ land.] The south.
14563,CANTO XXXI,
14564,CANTO XXXI,"v. 71. The beard.] “I perceived, that when she desired me to raise my"
14565,CANTO XXXI,"beard, instead of telling me to lift up my head, a severe reflection"
14566,CANTO XXXI,was implied on my want of that wisdom which should accompany the age of
14567,CANTO XXXI,manhood.”
14568,CANTO XXXI,
14569,CANTO XXXI,v. 98. Tu asperges me.] A prayer repeated by the priest at sprinkling

14580,CANTO XXXII,
14581,CANTO XXXII,v. 9. Two fix’d a gaze.] The allegorical interpretation of Vellutello
14582,CANTO XXXII,"whether it be considered as justly terrible from the text or not,"
14583,CANTO XXXII,"conveys so useful a lesson, that it deserves our notice. “The"
14584,CANTO XXXII,understanding is sometimes so intently engaged in contemplating the
14585,CANTO XXXII,"light of divine truth in the scriptures, that it becomes dazzled, and"
14586,CANTO XXXII,"is made less capable of attaining such knowledge, than if it had sought"
14587,CANTO XXXII,after it with greater moderation”

14609,CANTO XXXII,"v. 110. The bird of Jove.] This, which is imitated from Ezekiel, c."
14610,CANTO XXXII,"xvii. 3, 4. appears to be typical of the persecutions which the church"
14611,CANTO XXXII,sustained from the Roman Emperors.
14612,CANTO XXXII,
14613,CANTO XXXII,v. 118. A fox.] By the fox perhaps is represented the treachery of the
14614,CANTO XXXII,heretics.
14615,CANTO XXXII,
14616,CANTO XXXII,v. 124. With his feathers lin’d.]. An allusion to the donations made by
14617,CANTO XXXII,the Roman Emperors to the church.
14618,CANTO XXXII,
14619,CANTO XXXII,v. 130. A dragon.] Probably Mahomet.
14620,CANTO XXXII,
14621,CANTO XXXII,v. 136. With plumes.] The donations before mentioned.
14622,CANTO XXXII,
14623,CANTO XXXII,"v. 142. Heads.] By the seven heads, it is supposed with sufficient"
14624,CANTO XXXII,"probability, are meant the seven capital sins, by the three with two"
14625,CANTO XXXII,"horns, pride, anger, and avarice, injurious both to man himself and to"
14626,CANTO XXXII,"his neighbor: by the four with one horn, gluttony, lukewarmness,"
14627,CANTO XXXII,"concupiscence, and envy, hurtful, at least in their primary effects,"
14628,CANTO XXXII,chiefly to him who is guilty of them.
14629,CANTO XXXII,
14630,CANTO XXXII,v. 146. O’er it.] The harlot is thought to represent the state of the
14631,CANTO XXXII,church under Boniface VIII and the giant to figure Philip IV of France.
14632,CANTO XXXII,
14633,CANTO XXXII,v. 155. Dragg’d on.] The removal of the Pope’s residence from Rome to

14642,CANTO XXXIII,"hath occasioned the destruction of the church, that vessel which the"
14643,CANTO XXXIII,"serpent brake, hope to appease the anger of the Deity by any outward"
14644,CANTO XXXIII,"acts of religious, or rather superstitious, ceremony, such as was that,"
14645,CANTO XXXIII,"in our poet’s time, performed by a murderer at Florence, who imagined"
14646,CANTO XXXIII,"himself secure from vengeance, if he ate a sop of bread in wine, upon"
14647,CANTO XXXIII,"the grave of the person murdered, within the space of nine days.”"
14648,CANTO XXXIII,
14649,CANTO XXXIII,v. 38. That eagle.] He prognosticates that the Emperor of Germany will
14650,CANTO XXXIII,"not always continue to submit to the usurpations of the Pope, and"
14651,CANTO XXXIII,foretells the coming of Henry VII Duke of Luxembourg signified by the
14652,CANTO XXXIII,"numerical figures DVX; or, as Lombardi supposes, of Can Grande della"
14653,CANTO XXXIII,"Scala, appointed the leader of the Ghibelline forces. It is unnecessary"
14654,CANTO XXXIII,to point out the imitation of the Apocalypse in the manner of this
14655,CANTO XXXIII,prophecy.
14656,CANTO XXXIII,
14657,CANTO XXXIII,"v. 50. The Naiads.] Dante, it is observed, has been led into a mistake"
14658,CANTO XXXIII,"by a corruption in the text of Ovid’s Metam. I. vii. 75, where he"
14659,CANTO XXXIII,found- Carmina Naiades non intellecta priorum;
14660,CANTO XXXIII,
14661,CANTO XXXIII,"instead of Carmina Laiades, &c. as it has been since corrected."
14662,CANTO XXXIII,"Lombardi refers to Pansanias, where “the Nymphs” are spoken of as"
14663,CANTO XXXIII,expounders of oracles for a vindication of the poet’s accuracy. Should
14664,CANTO XXXIII,the reader blame me for not departing from the error of the original
14665,CANTO XXXIII,"(if error it be), he may substitute"
14666,CANTO XXXIII,
14667,CANTO XXXIII,"Events shall be the Oedipus will solve, &c."
14668,CANTO XXXIII,
14669,CANTO XXXIII,"v. 67. Elsa’s numbing waters.] The Elsa, a little stream, which flows"
14670,CANTO XXXIII,"into the Arno about twenty miles below Florence, is said to possess a"
14671,CANTO XXXIII,petrifying quality.
14672,CANTO XXXIII,
14673,CANTO XXXIII,v. 78. That one brings home his staff inwreath’d with palm.] “For the
14674,CANTO XXXIII,"same cause that the pilgrim, returning from Palestine, brings home his"
14675,CANTO XXXIII,"staff, or bourdon, bound with palm,” that is, to show where he has"
14676,CANTO XXXIII,been.
14677,CANTO XXXIII,
14678,CANTO XXXIII,Che si reca ’I bordon di palma cinto.
14679,CANTO XXXIII,
14680,CANTO XXXIII,"“In regard to the word bourdon, why it has been applied to a pilgrim’s"
14681,CANTO XXXIII,"staff, it is not easy to guess. I believe, however that this name has"
14682,CANTO XXXIII,"been given to such sort of staves, because pilgrims usually travel and"
14683,CANTO XXXIII,"perform their pilgrimages on foot, their staves serving them instead of"
14684,CANTO XXXIII,"horses or mules, then called bourdons and burdones, by writers in the"
14685,CANTO XXXIII,middle ages.” Mr. Johnes’s Translation of Joinville’s Memoirs.

14704,CANTO I,"Witness of things, which to relate again"
14705,CANTO I,Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;
14706,CANTO I,"For that, so near approaching its desire"
14707,CANTO I,"Our intellect is to such depth absorb’d,"
14708,CANTO I,"That memory cannot follow. Nathless all,"
14709,CANTO I,That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm
14710,CANTO I,"Could store, shall now be matter of my song."
14711,CANTO I,
14712,CANTO I,"Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,"

14716,CANTO I,Suffic’d me; henceforth there is need of both
14717,CANTO I,For my remaining enterprise Do thou
14718,CANTO I,"Enter into my bosom, and there breathe"
14719,CANTO I,"So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg’d"
14720,CANTO I,Forth from his limbs unsheath’d. O power divine!
14721,CANTO I,"If thou to me of shine impart so much,"
14722,CANTO I,That of that happy realm the shadow’d form
14723,CANTO I,"Trac’d in my thoughts I may set forth to view,"
14724,CANTO I,Thou shalt behold me of thy favour’d tree
14725,CANTO I,"Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;"

14729,CANTO I,Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills

14731,CANTO I,"From the Pierian foliage, when one breast"
14732,CANTO I,Is with such thirst inspir’d. From a small spark
14733,CANTO I,Great flame hath risen: after me perchance
14734,CANTO I,"Others with better voice may pray, and gain"
14735,CANTO I,From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.
14736,CANTO I,
14737,CANTO I,"Through diver passages, the world’s bright lamp"
14738,CANTO I,"Rises to mortals, but through that which joins"
14739,CANTO I,"Four circles with the threefold cross, in best"
14740,CANTO I,"Course, and in happiest constellation set"
14741,CANTO I,"He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives"
14742,CANTO I,"Its temper and impression. Morning there,"
14743,CANTO I,Here eve was by almost such passage made;
14744,CANTO I,"And whiteness had o’erspread that hemisphere,"
14745,CANTO I,Blackness the other part; when to the left
14746,CANTO I,"I saw Beatrice turn’d, and on the sun"
14747,CANTO I,"Gazing, as never eagle fix’d his ken."
14748,CANTO I,As from the first a second beam is wont
14749,CANTO I,"To issue, and reflected upwards rise,"
14750,CANTO I,"E’en as a pilgrim bent on his return,"
14751,CANTO I,"So of her act, that through the eyesight pass’d"
14752,CANTO I,"Into my fancy, mine was form’d; and straight,"
14753,CANTO I,"Beyond our mortal wont, I fix’d mine eyes"
14754,CANTO I,"Upon the sun. Much is allowed us there,"
14755,CANTO I,That here exceeds our pow’r; thanks to the place
14756,CANTO I,Made for the dwelling of the human kind
14757,CANTO I,
14758,CANTO I,"I suffer’d it not long, and yet so long"
14759,CANTO I,"That I beheld it bick’ring sparks around,"
14760,CANTO I,As iron that comes boiling from the fire.
14761,CANTO I,And suddenly upon the day appear’d
14762,CANTO I,"A day new-ris’n, as he, who hath the power,"
14763,CANTO I,Had with another sun bedeck’d the sky.
14764,CANTO I,
14765,CANTO I,"Her eyes fast fix’d on the eternal wheels,"
14766,CANTO I,Beatrice stood unmov’d; and I with ken
14767,CANTO I,"Fix’d upon her, from upward gaze remov’d"
14768,CANTO I,"At her aspect, such inwardly became"
14769,CANTO I,"As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,"
14770,CANTO I,That made him peer among the ocean gods;
14771,CANTO I,Words may not tell of that transhuman change:
14772,CANTO I,"And therefore let the example serve, though weak,"
14773,CANTO I,For those whom grace hath better proof in store
14774,CANTO I,
14775,CANTO I,"If I were only what thou didst create,"
14776,CANTO I,"Then newly, Love! by whom the heav’n is rul’d,"
14777,CANTO I,"Thou know’st, who by thy light didst bear me up."
14778,CANTO I,"Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,"
14779,CANTO I,Desired Spirit! with its harmony
14780,CANTO I,"Temper’d of thee and measur’d, charm’d mine ear,"
14781,CANTO I,Then seem’d to me so much of heav’n to blaze
14782,CANTO I,"With the sun’s flame, that rain or flood ne’er made"
14783,CANTO I,"A lake so broad. The newness of the sound,"
14784,CANTO I,"And that great light, inflam’d me with desire,"
14785,CANTO I,"Keener than e’er was felt, to know their cause."
14786,CANTO I,
14787,CANTO I,"Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,"
14788,CANTO I,"To calm my troubled mind, before I ask’d,"
14789,CANTO I,"Open’d her lips, and gracious thus began:"
14790,CANTO I,“With false imagination thou thyself
14791,CANTO I,"Mak’st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,"
14792,CANTO I,"Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off."
14793,CANTO I,Thou art not on the earth as thou believ’st;
14794,CANTO I,For light’ning scap’d from its own proper place
14795,CANTO I,"Ne’er ran, as thou hast hither now return’d.”"
14796,CANTO I,
14797,CANTO I,"Although divested of my first-rais’d doubt,"
14798,CANTO I,"By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,"
14799,CANTO I,"Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,"
14800,CANTO I,"And said: “Already satisfied, I rest"
14801,CANTO I,"From admiration deep, but now admire"
14802,CANTO I,How I above those lighter bodies rise.”
14803,CANTO I,
14804,CANTO I,"Whence, after utt’rance of a piteous sigh,"
14805,CANTO I,"She tow’rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,"
14806,CANTO I,As on her frenzied child a mother casts;
14807,CANTO I,Then thus began: “Among themselves all things
14808,CANTO I,"Have order; and from hence the form, which makes"
14809,CANTO I,The universe resemble God. In this
14810,CANTO I,The higher creatures see the printed steps
14811,CANTO I,"Of that eternal worth, which is the end"
14812,CANTO I,"Whither the line is drawn. All natures lean,"
14813,CANTO I,"In this their order, diversely, some more,"
14814,CANTO I,Some less approaching to their primal source.
14815,CANTO I,Thus they to different havens are mov’d on
14816,CANTO I,"Through the vast sea of being, and each one"
14817,CANTO I,"With instinct giv’n, that bears it in its course;"
14818,CANTO I,"This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,"
14819,CANTO I,"This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,"
14820,CANTO I,"This the brute earth together knits, and binds."
14821,CANTO I,"Nor only creatures, void of intellect,"
14822,CANTO I,"Are aim’d at by this bow; hut even those,"
14823,CANTO I,"That have intelligence and love, are pierc’d."
14824,CANTO I,"That Providence, who so well orders all,"
14825,CANTO I,"With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,"
14826,CANTO I,"In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,"
14827,CANTO I,"Is turn’d: and thither now, as to our seat"
14828,CANTO I,"Predestin’d, we are carried by the force"
14829,CANTO I,"Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,"
14830,CANTO I,"But at fair aim and glad. Yet is it true,"
14831,CANTO I,That as ofttimes but ill accords the form
14832,CANTO I,"To the design of art, through sluggishness"
14833,CANTO I,"Of unreplying matter, so this course"
14834,CANTO I,"Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who"
14835,CANTO I,"Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;"
14836,CANTO I,"As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,"
14837,CANTO I,"From its original impulse warp’d, to earth,"
14838,CANTO I,By vicious fondness. Thou no more admire
14839,CANTO I,"Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse"
14840,CANTO I,Of torrent downwards from a mountain’s height.
14841,CANTO I,"There would in thee for wonder be more cause,"
14842,CANTO I,"If, free of hind’rance, thou hadst fix’d thyself"
14843,CANTO I,"Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.”"
14844,CANTO I,
14845,CANTO I,"So said, she turn’d toward the heav’n her face."

14857,CANTO II,"Revisit, nor put out to open sea,"
14858,CANTO II,"Where losing me, perchance ye may remain"
14859,CANTO II,Bewilder’d in deep maze. The way I pass
14860,CANTO II,"Ne’er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,"
14861,CANTO II,"Apollo guides me, and another Nine"
14862,CANTO II,To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.

14872,CANTO II,
14873,CANTO II,"The increate perpetual thirst, that draws"

14883,CANTO II,Bespake me: “Gratefully direct thy mind

14885,CANTO II,
14886,CANTO II,"Me seem’d as if a cloud had cover’d us,"
14887,CANTO II,"Translucent, solid, firm, and polish’d bright,"

14894,CANTO II,"Another could endure, which needs must be"
14895,CANTO II,"If body enter body, how much more"
14896,CANTO II,Must the desire inflame us to behold
14897,CANTO II,"That essence, which discovers by what means"
14898,CANTO II,God and our nature join’d! There will be seen
14899,CANTO II,"That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,"
14900,CANTO II,"But in itself intelligibly plain,"
14901,CANTO II,E’en as the truth that man at first believes.
14902,CANTO II,
14903,CANTO II,"I answered: “Lady! I with thoughts devout,"
14904,CANTO II,"Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,"
14905,CANTO II,Who hath remov’d me from the mortal world.
14906,CANTO II,"But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots"
14907,CANTO II,"Upon this body, which below on earth"
14908,CANTO II,Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?”
14909,CANTO II,
14910,CANTO II,"She somewhat smil’d, then spake: “If mortals err"
14911,CANTO II,"In their opinion, when the key of sense"
14912,CANTO II,"Unlocks not, surely wonder’s weapon keen"
14913,CANTO II,"Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find’st, the wings"
14914,CANTO II,Of reason to pursue the senses’ flight
14915,CANTO II,"Are short. But what thy own thought is, declare.”"
14916,CANTO II,
14917,CANTO II,"Then I: “What various here above appears,"
14918,CANTO II,"Is caus’d, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.”"
14919,CANTO II,
14920,CANTO II,She then resum’d: “Thou certainly wilt see
14921,CANTO II,"In falsehood thy belief o’erwhelm’d, if well"
14922,CANTO II,"Thou listen to the arguments, which I"
14923,CANTO II,Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays
14924,CANTO II,"Numberless lights, the which in kind and size"
14925,CANTO II,May be remark’d of different aspects;
14926,CANTO II,"If rare or dense of that were cause alone,"
14927,CANTO II,"One single virtue then would be in all,"
14928,CANTO II,"Alike distributed, or more, or less."
14929,CANTO II,Different virtues needs must be the fruits
14930,CANTO II,"Of formal principles, and these, save one,"
14931,CANTO II,"Will by thy reasoning be destroy’d. Beside,"
14932,CANTO II,"If rarity were of that dusk the cause,"
14933,CANTO II,"Which thou inquirest, either in some part"
14934,CANTO II,"That planet must throughout be void, nor fed"
14935,CANTO II,"With its own matter; or, as bodies share"
14936,CANTO II,"Their fat and leanness, in like manner this"
14937,CANTO II,"Must in its volume change the leaves. The first,"
14938,CANTO II,"If it were true, had through the sun’s eclipse"
14939,CANTO II,"Been manifested, by transparency"
14940,CANTO II,"Of light, as through aught rare beside effus’d."
14941,CANTO II,But this is not. Therefore remains to see
14942,CANTO II,"The other cause: and if the other fall,"
14943,CANTO II,Erroneous so must prove what seem’d to thee.
14944,CANTO II,If not from side to side this rarity
14945,CANTO II,"Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence"
14946,CANTO II,Its contrary no further lets it pass.
14947,CANTO II,"And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,"
14948,CANTO II,"Must be pour’d back, as colour comes, through glass"
14949,CANTO II,"Reflected, which behind it lead conceals."
14950,CANTO II,"Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue"
14951,CANTO II,"Than in the other part the ray is shown,"
14952,CANTO II,By being thence refracted farther back.
14953,CANTO II,From this perplexity will free thee soon
14954,CANTO II,"Experience, if thereof thou trial make,"
14955,CANTO II,The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.
14956,CANTO II,"Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove"
14957,CANTO II,"From thee alike, and more remote the third."
14958,CANTO II,"Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;"
14959,CANTO II,"Then turn’d toward them, cause behind thy back"
14960,CANTO II,"A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,"
14961,CANTO II,And thus reflected come to thee from all.
14962,CANTO II,Though that beheld most distant do not stretch
14963,CANTO II,"A space so ample, yet in brightness thou"
14964,CANTO II,"Will own it equaling the rest. But now,"
14965,CANTO II,"As under snow the ground, if the warm ray"
14966,CANTO II,"Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue"
14967,CANTO II,"And cold, that cover’d it before, so thee,"
14968,CANTO II,"Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform"
14969,CANTO II,"With light so lively, that the tremulous beam"
14970,CANTO II,"Shall quiver where it falls. Within the heaven,"
14971,CANTO II,"Where peace divine inhabits, circles round"
14972,CANTO II,"A body, in whose virtue dies the being"
14973,CANTO II,"Of all that it contains. The following heaven,"
14974,CANTO II,"That hath so many lights, this being divides,"
14975,CANTO II,"Through different essences, from it distinct,"
14976,CANTO II,And yet contain’d within it. The other orbs
14977,CANTO II,Their separate distinctions variously
14978,CANTO II,"Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt."
14979,CANTO II,"Thus do these organs of the world proceed,"
14980,CANTO II,"As thou beholdest now, from step to step,"
14981,CANTO II,"Their influences from above deriving,"
14982,CANTO II,"And thence transmitting downwards. Mark me well,"
14983,CANTO II,"How through this passage to the truth I ford,"
14984,CANTO II,"The truth thou lov’st, that thou henceforth alone,"
14985,CANTO II,"May’st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold."
14986,CANTO II,
14987,CANTO II,"“The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,"
14988,CANTO II,"As mallet by the workman’s hand, must needs"
14989,CANTO II,"By blessed movers be inspir’d. This heaven,"
14990,CANTO II,"Made beauteous by so many luminaries,"
14991,CANTO II,"From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,"
14992,CANTO II,Its image takes an impress as a seal:
14993,CANTO II,"And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,"
14994,CANTO II,"Through members different, yet together form’d,"
14995,CANTO II,In different pow’rs resolves itself; e’en so
14996,CANTO II,The intellectual efficacy unfolds
14997,CANTO II,Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;
14998,CANTO II,On its own unity revolving still.
14999,CANTO II,Different virtue compact different
15000,CANTO II,"Makes with the precious body it enlivens,"
15001,CANTO II,"With which it knits, as life in you is knit."
15002,CANTO II,"From its original nature full of joy,"
15003,CANTO II,"The virtue mingled through the body shines,"
15004,CANTO II,As joy through pupil of the living eye.
15005,CANTO II,"From hence proceeds, that which from light to light"
15006,CANTO II,"Seems different, and not from dense or rare."
15007,CANTO II,"This is the formal cause, that generates"
15008,CANTO II,"Proportion’d to its power, the dusk or clear.”"
15009,CANTO II,
15010,CANTO II,
15011,CANTO II,
15012,CANTO II,
15013,CANTO III,CANTO III
15014,CANTO III,
15015,CANTO III,
15016,CANTO III,"That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm’d"
15017,CANTO III,"Had of fair truth unveil’d the sweet aspect,"
15018,CANTO III,"By proof of right, and of the false reproof;"
15019,CANTO III,"And I, to own myself convinc’d and free"
15020,CANTO III,"Of doubt, as much as needed, rais’d my head"
15021,CANTO III,"Erect for speech. But soon a sight appear’d,"
15022,CANTO III,"Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix’d,"
15023,CANTO III,That of confession I no longer thought.
15024,CANTO III,
15025,CANTO III,"As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave"
15026,CANTO III,"Clear and unmov’d, and flowing not so deep"
15027,CANTO III,"As that its bed is dark, the shape returns"
15028,CANTO III,"So faint of our impictur’d lineaments,"
15029,CANTO III,That on white forehead set a pearl as strong
15030,CANTO III,"Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,"
15031,CANTO III,"All stretch’d to speak, from whence I straight conceiv’d"
15032,CANTO III,"Delusion opposite to that, which rais’d"
15033,CANTO III,"Between the man and fountain, amorous flame."
15034,CANTO III,
15035,CANTO III,"Sudden, as I perceiv’d them, deeming these"
15036,CANTO III,Reflected semblances to see of whom
15037,CANTO III,"They were, I turn’d mine eyes, and nothing saw;"
15038,CANTO III,"Then turn’d them back, directed on the light"
15039,CANTO III,"Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams"
15040,CANTO III,"From her celestial eyes. “Wonder not thou,”"
15041,CANTO III,"She cry’d, “at this my smiling, when I see"
15042,CANTO III,Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth
15043,CANTO III,"It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,"
15044,CANTO III,Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.
15045,CANTO III,"True substances are these, which thou behold’st,"
15046,CANTO III,Hither through failure of their vow exil’d.
15047,CANTO III,"But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,"
15048,CANTO III,"That the true light, which fills them with desire,"
15049,CANTO III,Permits not from its beams their feet to stray.”
15050,CANTO III,
15051,CANTO III,Straight to the shadow which for converse seem’d
15052,CANTO III,"Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,"
15053,CANTO III,As one by over-eagerness perplex’d:
15054,CANTO III,"“O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays"
15055,CANTO III,"Of life eternal, of that sweetness know’st"
15056,CANTO III,"The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far"
15057,CANTO III,"All apprehension, me it well would please,"
15058,CANTO III,"If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this"
15059,CANTO III,"Your station here.” Whence she, with kindness prompt,"
15060,CANTO III,"And eyes glist’ning with smiles: “Our charity,"
15061,CANTO III,"To any wish by justice introduc’d,"
15062,CANTO III,"Bars not the door, no more than she above,"
15063,CANTO III,Who would have all her court be like herself.
15064,CANTO III,I was a virgin sister in the earth;
15065,CANTO III,"And if thy mind observe me well, this form,"
15066,CANTO III,"With such addition grac’d of loveliness,"
15067,CANTO III,"Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know"
15068,CANTO III,"Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac’d,"
15069,CANTO III,Here ’mid these other blessed also blest.
15070,CANTO III,"Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone"
15071,CANTO III,"With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv’d,"
15072,CANTO III,Admitted to his order dwell in joy.
15073,CANTO III,"And this condition, which appears so low,"
15074,CANTO III,"Is for this cause assign’d us, that our vows"
15075,CANTO III,Were in some part neglected and made void.”
15076,CANTO III,
15077,CANTO III,Whence I to her replied: “Something divine
15078,CANTO III,"Beams in your countenance, wond’rous fair,"
15079,CANTO III,From former knowledge quite transmuting you.
15080,CANTO III,Therefore to recollect was I so slow.
15081,CANTO III,But what thou sayst hath to my memory
15082,CANTO III,"Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms"
15083,CANTO III,"Is easier. Yet inform me, ye, who here"
15084,CANTO III,"Are happy, long ye for a higher place"
15085,CANTO III,"More to behold, and more in love to dwell?”"
15086,CANTO III,
15087,CANTO III,"She with those other spirits gently smil’d,"
15088,CANTO III,"Then answer’d with such gladness, that she seem’d"
15089,CANTO III,With love’s first flame to glow: “Brother! our will
15090,CANTO III,Is in composure settled by the power
15091,CANTO III,"Of charity, who makes us will alone"
15092,CANTO III,"What we possess, and nought beyond desire;"
15093,CANTO III,"If we should wish to be exalted more,"
15094,CANTO III,Then must our wishes jar with the high will
15095,CANTO III,"Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs"
15096,CANTO III,"Thou wilt confess not possible, if here"
15097,CANTO III,"To be in charity must needs befall,"
15098,CANTO III,And if her nature well thou contemplate.
15099,CANTO III,Rather it is inherent in this state
15100,CANTO III,"Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within"
15101,CANTO III,"The divine will, by which our wills with his"
15102,CANTO III,Are one. So that as we from step to step
15103,CANTO III,"Are plac’d throughout this kingdom, pleases all,"
15104,CANTO III,"E’en as our King, who in us plants his will;"
15105,CANTO III,And in his will is our tranquillity;
15106,CANTO III,"It is the mighty ocean, whither tends"
15107,CANTO III,Whatever it creates and nature makes.”
15108,CANTO III,
15109,CANTO III,Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav’n
15110,CANTO III,"Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew"
15111,CANTO III,The supreme virtue show’r not over all.
15112,CANTO III,
15113,CANTO III,"But as it chances, if one sort of food"
15114,CANTO III,"Hath satiated, and of another still"
15115,CANTO III,"The appetite remains, that this is ask’d,"
15116,CANTO III,And thanks for that return’d; e’en so did I
15117,CANTO III,"In word and motion, bent from her to learn"
15118,CANTO III,"What web it was, through which she had not drawn"
15119,CANTO III,The shuttle to its point. She thus began:
15120,CANTO III,“Exalted worth and perfectness of life
15121,CANTO III,"The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,"
15122,CANTO III,By whose pure laws upon your nether earth
15123,CANTO III,"The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,"
15124,CANTO III,That e’en till death they may keep watch or sleep
15125,CANTO III,"With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,"
15126,CANTO III,Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.
15127,CANTO III,"from the world, to follow her, when young"
15128,CANTO III,"Escap’d; and, in her vesture mantling me,"
15129,CANTO III,Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.
15130,CANTO III,"Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,"
15131,CANTO III,Forth snatch’d me from the pleasant cloister’s pale.
15132,CANTO III,God knows how after that my life was fram’d.
15133,CANTO III,"This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst"
15134,CANTO III,"At my right side, burning with all the light"
15135,CANTO III,"Of this our orb, what of myself I tell"
15136,CANTO III,"May to herself apply. From her, like me"
15137,CANTO III,"A sister, with like violence were torn"
15138,CANTO III,"The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows."
15139,CANTO III,E’en when she to the world again was brought
15140,CANTO III,"In spite of her own will and better wont,"
15141,CANTO III,Yet not for that the bosom’s inward veil
15142,CANTO III,Did she renounce. This is the luminary
15143,CANTO III,"Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,"
15144,CANTO III,"Which blew the second over Suabia’s realm,"
15145,CANTO III,"That power produc’d, which was the third and last.”"
15146,CANTO III,
15147,CANTO III,"She ceas’d from further talk, and then began"
15148,CANTO III,"“Ave Maria” singing, and with that song"
15149,CANTO III,"Vanish’d, as heavy substance through deep wave."
15150,CANTO III,
15151,CANTO III,"Mine eye, that far as it was capable,"
15152,CANTO III,"Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,"
15153,CANTO III,"Turn’d to the mark where greater want impell’d,"
15154,CANTO III,And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.
15155,CANTO III,But she as light’ning beam’d upon my looks:
15156,CANTO III,So that the sight sustain’d it not at first.
15157,CANTO III,Whence I to question her became less prompt.
15158,CANTO III,
15159,CANTO III,
15160,CANTO III,
15161,CANTO III,
15162,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
15163,CANTO IV,
15164,CANTO IV,
15165,CANTO IV,"Between two kinds of food, both equally"
15166,CANTO IV,"Remote and tempting, first a man might die"
15167,CANTO IV,"Of hunger, ere he one could freely choose."
15168,CANTO IV,E’en so would stand a lamb between the maw
15169,CANTO IV,"Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:"
15170,CANTO IV,"E’en so between two deer a dog would stand,"
15171,CANTO IV,"Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise"
15172,CANTO IV,"I to myself impute, by equal doubts"
15173,CANTO IV,"Held in suspense, since of necessity"
15174,CANTO IV,"It happen’d. Silent was I, yet desire"
15175,CANTO IV,Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake
15176,CANTO IV,My wish more earnestly than language could.
15177,CANTO IV,
15178,CANTO IV,"As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed"
15179,CANTO IV,"From ire, that spurr’d him on to deeds unjust"
15180,CANTO IV,And violent; so look’d Beatrice then.
15181,CANTO IV,
15182,CANTO IV,"“Well I discern,” she thus her words address’d,"
15183,CANTO IV,"“How contrary desires each way constrain thee,"
15184,CANTO IV,So that thy anxious thought is in itself
15185,CANTO IV,"Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth."
15186,CANTO IV,Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;
15187,CANTO IV,What reason that another’s violence
15188,CANTO IV,Should stint the measure of my fair desert?
15189,CANTO IV,
15190,CANTO IV,"“Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,"
15191,CANTO IV,"That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem’d,"
15192,CANTO IV,Return. These are the questions which thy will
15193,CANTO IV,Urge equally; and therefore I the first
15194,CANTO IV,Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.
15195,CANTO IV,"Of seraphim he who is most ensky’d,"
15196,CANTO IV,"Moses and Samuel, and either John,"
15197,CANTO IV,"Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary’s self,"
15198,CANTO IV,"Have not in any other heav’n their seats,"
15199,CANTO IV,Than have those spirits which so late thou saw’st;
15200,CANTO IV,Nor more or fewer years exist; but all
15201,CANTO IV,"Make the first circle beauteous, diversely"
15202,CANTO IV,"Partaking of sweet life, as more or less"
15203,CANTO IV,Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.
15204,CANTO IV,"Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns"
15205,CANTO IV,"This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee"
15206,CANTO IV,Of that celestial furthest from the height.
15207,CANTO IV,"Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:"
15208,CANTO IV,Since from things sensible alone ye learn
15209,CANTO IV,"That, which digested rightly after turns"
15210,CANTO IV,To intellectual. For no other cause
15211,CANTO IV,"The scripture, condescending graciously"
15212,CANTO IV,"To your perception, hands and feet to God"
15213,CANTO IV,"Attributes, nor so means: and holy church"
15214,CANTO IV,Doth represent with human countenance
15215,CANTO IV,"Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made"
15216,CANTO IV,"Tobias whole. Unlike what here thou seest,"
15217,CANTO IV,"The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms"
15218,CANTO IV,"Each soul restor’d to its particular star,"
15219,CANTO IV,"Believing it to have been taken thence,"
15220,CANTO IV,When nature gave it to inform her mold:
15221,CANTO IV,Since to appearance his intention is
15222,CANTO IV,E’en what his words declare: or else to shun
15223,CANTO IV,"Derision, haply thus he hath disguis’d"
15224,CANTO IV,"His true opinion. If his meaning be,"
15225,CANTO IV,That to the influencing of these orbs revert
15226,CANTO IV,"The honour and the blame in human acts,"
15227,CANTO IV,Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.
15228,CANTO IV,"This principle, not understood aright,"
15229,CANTO IV,Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;
15230,CANTO IV,"So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,"
15231,CANTO IV,"And Mercury, and Mars. That other doubt,"
15232,CANTO IV,"Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings"
15233,CANTO IV,No peril of removing thee from me.
15234,CANTO IV,
15235,CANTO IV,"“That, to the eye of man, our justice seems"
15236,CANTO IV,"Unjust, is argument for faith, and not"
15237,CANTO IV,For heretic declension. To the end
15238,CANTO IV,"This truth may stand more clearly in your view,"
15239,CANTO IV,I will content thee even to thy wish
15240,CANTO IV,
15241,CANTO IV,"“If violence be, when that which suffers, nought"
15242,CANTO IV,"Consents to that which forceth, not for this"
15243,CANTO IV,"These spirits stood exculpate. For the will,"
15244,CANTO IV,"That will not, still survives unquench’d, and doth"
15245,CANTO IV,"As nature doth in fire, tho’ violence"
15246,CANTO IV,"Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield"
15247,CANTO IV,"Or more or less, so far it follows force."
15248,CANTO IV,"And thus did these, whom they had power to seek"
15249,CANTO IV,"The hallow’d place again. In them, had will"
15250,CANTO IV,"Been perfect, such as once upon the bars"
15251,CANTO IV,"Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola"
15252,CANTO IV,"To his own hand remorseless, to the path,"
15253,CANTO IV,"Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten’d back,"
15254,CANTO IV,When liberty return’d: but in too few
15255,CANTO IV,Resolve so steadfast dwells. And by these words
15256,CANTO IV,"If duly weigh’d, that argument is void,"
15257,CANTO IV,Which oft might have perplex’d thee still. But now
15258,CANTO IV,"Another question thwarts thee, which to solve"
15259,CANTO IV,Might try thy patience without better aid.
15260,CANTO IV,"I have, no doubt, instill’d into thy mind,"
15261,CANTO IV,That blessed spirit may not lie; since near
15262,CANTO IV,The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:
15263,CANTO IV,And thou might’st after of Piccarda learn
15264,CANTO IV,That Constance held affection to the veil;
15265,CANTO IV,So that she seems to contradict me here.
15266,CANTO IV,"Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc’d for men"
15267,CANTO IV,"To do what they had gladly left undone,"
15268,CANTO IV,Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:
15269,CANTO IV,"E’en as Alcmaeon, at his father’s suit"
15270,CANTO IV,"Slew his own mother, so made pitiless"
15271,CANTO IV,"Not to lose pity. On this point bethink thee,"
15272,CANTO IV,That force and will are blended in such wise
15273,CANTO IV,As not to make the’ offence excusable.
15274,CANTO IV,"Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,"
15275,CANTO IV,That inasmuch as there is fear of woe
15276,CANTO IV,"From non-compliance, it agrees. Of will"
15277,CANTO IV,"Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I"
15278,CANTO IV,Of th’ other; so that both have truly said.”
15279,CANTO IV,
15280,CANTO IV,"Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well’d"
15281,CANTO IV,From forth the fountain of all truth; and such
15282,CANTO IV,"The rest, that to my wond’ring thoughts l found."
15283,CANTO IV,
15284,CANTO IV,“O thou of primal love the prime delight!
15285,CANTO IV,"Goddess! “I straight reply’d, “whose lively words"
15286,CANTO IV,Still shed new heat and vigour through my soul!
15287,CANTO IV,Affection fails me to requite thy grace
15288,CANTO IV,With equal sum of gratitude: be his
15289,CANTO IV,"To recompense, who sees and can reward thee."
15290,CANTO IV,"Well I discern, that by that truth alone"
15291,CANTO IV,"Enlighten’d, beyond which no truth may roam,"
15292,CANTO IV,Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:
15293,CANTO IV,"Therein she resteth, e’en as in his lair"
15294,CANTO IV,"The wild beast, soon as she hath reach’d that bound,"
15295,CANTO IV,And she hath power to reach it; else desire
15296,CANTO IV,Were given to no end. And thence doth doubt
15297,CANTO IV,"Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;"
15298,CANTO IV,And it is nature which from height to height
15299,CANTO IV,"On to the summit prompts us. This invites,"
15300,CANTO IV,"This doth assure me, lady, rev’rently"
15301,CANTO IV,"To ask thee of other truth, that yet"
15302,CANTO IV,"Is dark to me. I fain would know, if man"
15303,CANTO IV,By other works well done may so supply
15304,CANTO IV,"The failure of his vows, that in your scale"
15305,CANTO IV,They lack not weight.” I spake; and on me straight
15306,CANTO IV,Beatrice look’d with eyes that shot forth sparks
15307,CANTO IV,"Of love celestial in such copious stream,"
15308,CANTO IV,"That, virtue sinking in me overpower’d,"
15309,CANTO IV,"I turn’d, and downward bent confus’d my sight."
15310,CANTO IV,
15311,CANTO IV,
15312,CANTO IV,
15313,CANTO IV,
15314,CANTO V,CANTO V
15315,CANTO V,
15316,CANTO V,
15317,CANTO V,"“If beyond earthly wont, the flame of love"
15318,CANTO V,"Illume me, so that I o’ercome thy power"
15319,CANTO V,"Of vision, marvel not: but learn the cause"
15320,CANTO V,"In that perfection of the sight, which soon"
15321,CANTO V,"As apprehending, hasteneth on to reach"
15322,CANTO V,"The good it apprehends. I well discern,"
15323,CANTO V,How in thine intellect already shines
15324,CANTO V,"The light eternal, which to view alone"
15325,CANTO V,Ne’er fails to kindle love; and if aught else
15326,CANTO V,"Your love seduces, ’tis but that it shows"
15327,CANTO V,Some ill-mark’d vestige of that primal beam.
15328,CANTO V,
15329,CANTO V,"“This would’st thou know, if failure of the vow"
15330,CANTO V,"By other service may be so supplied,"
15331,CANTO V,As from self-question to assure the soul.”
15332,CANTO V,
15333,CANTO V,"Thus she her words, not heedless of my wish,"
15334,CANTO V,"Began; and thus, as one who breaks not off"
15335,CANTO V,"Discourse, continued in her saintly strain."
15336,CANTO V,"“Supreme of gifts, which God creating gave"
15337,CANTO V,"Of his free bounty, sign most evident"
15338,CANTO V,"Of goodness, and in his account most priz’d,"
15339,CANTO V,"Was liberty of will, the boon wherewith"
15340,CANTO V,"All intellectual creatures, and them sole"
15341,CANTO V,He hath endow’d. Hence now thou mayst infer
15342,CANTO V,"Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram’d"
15343,CANTO V,"That when man offers, God well-pleas’d accepts;"
15344,CANTO V,"For in the compact between God and him,"
15345,CANTO V,"This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,"
15346,CANTO V,"He makes the victim, and of his own act."
15347,CANTO V,What compensation therefore may he find?
15348,CANTO V,"If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,"
15349,CANTO V,"By using well thou think’st to consecrate,"
15350,CANTO V,Thou would’st of theft do charitable deed.
15351,CANTO V,Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.
15352,CANTO V,
15353,CANTO V,"“But forasmuch as holy church, herein"
15354,CANTO V,"Dispensing, seems to contradict the truth"
15355,CANTO V,"I have discover’d to thee, yet behooves"
15356,CANTO V,"Thou rest a little longer at the board,"
15357,CANTO V,"Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,"
15358,CANTO V,Digested fitly to nutrition turn.
15359,CANTO V,"Open thy mind to what I now unfold,"
15360,CANTO V,And give it inward keeping. Knowledge comes
15361,CANTO V,"Of learning well retain’d, unfruitful else."
15362,CANTO V,
15363,CANTO V,“This sacrifice in essence of two things
15364,CANTO V,"Consisteth; one is that, whereof ’tis made,"
15365,CANTO V,"The covenant the other. For the last,"
15366,CANTO V,It ne’er is cancell’d if not kept: and hence
15367,CANTO V,I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.
15368,CANTO V,"For this it was enjoin’d the Israelites,"
15369,CANTO V,"Though leave were giv’n them, as thou know’st, to change"
15370,CANTO V,"The offering, still to offer. Th’ other part,"
15371,CANTO V,"The matter and the substance of the vow,"
15372,CANTO V,"May well be such, to that without offence"
15373,CANTO V,It may for other substance be exchang’d.
15374,CANTO V,But at his own discretion none may shift
15375,CANTO V,"The burden on his shoulders, unreleas’d"
15376,CANTO V,"By either key, the yellow and the white."
15377,CANTO V,"Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,"
15378,CANTO V,If the last bond be not within the new
15379,CANTO V,"Included, as the quatre in the six."
15380,CANTO V,No satisfaction therefore can be paid
15381,CANTO V,"For what so precious in the balance weighs,"
15382,CANTO V,That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.
15383,CANTO V,"Take then no vow at random: ta’en, with faith"
15384,CANTO V,"Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,"
15385,CANTO V,"Blindly to execute a rash resolve,"
15386,CANTO V,"Whom better it had suited to exclaim,"
15387,CANTO V,"‘I have done ill,’ than to redeem his pledge"
15388,CANTO V,"By doing worse or, not unlike to him"
15389,CANTO V,"In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:"
15390,CANTO V,"Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn’d"
15391,CANTO V,"Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn"
15392,CANTO V,"Both wise and simple, even all, who hear"
15393,CANTO V,"Of so fell sacrifice. Be ye more staid,"
15394,CANTO V,"O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind"
15395,CANTO V,Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves
15396,CANTO V,"In every water. Either testament,"
15397,CANTO V,"The old and new, is yours: and for your guide"
15398,CANTO V,The shepherd of the church let this suffice
15399,CANTO V,"To save you. When by evil lust entic’d,"
15400,CANTO V,"Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;"
15401,CANTO V,"Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,"
15402,CANTO V,"Hold you in mock’ry. Be not, as the lamb,"
15403,CANTO V,"That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother’s milk,"
15404,CANTO V,To dally with itself in idle play.”
15405,CANTO V,
15406,CANTO V,Such were the words that Beatrice spake:
15407,CANTO V,"These ended, to that region, where the world"
15408,CANTO V,"Is liveliest, full of fond desire she turn’d."
15409,CANTO V,
15410,CANTO V,"Though mainly prompt new question to propose,"
15411,CANTO V,Her silence and chang’d look did keep me dumb.
15412,CANTO V,"And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,"
15413,CANTO V,Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped
15414,CANTO V,Into the second realm. There I beheld
15415,CANTO V,"The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb"
15416,CANTO V,"Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star"
15417,CANTO V,"Were mov’d to gladness, what then was my cheer,"
15418,CANTO V,Whom nature hath made apt for every change!
15419,CANTO V,
15420,CANTO V,"As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,"
15421,CANTO V,"If aught approach them from without, do draw"
15422,CANTO V,"Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew"
15423,CANTO V,"Full more than thousand splendours towards us,"
15424,CANTO V,And in each one was heard: “Lo! one arriv’d
15425,CANTO V,To multiply our loves!” and as each came
15426,CANTO V,"The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,"
15427,CANTO V,"Witness’d augmented joy. Here, reader! think,"
15428,CANTO V,"If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,"
15429,CANTO V,To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;
15430,CANTO V,And thou shalt see what vehement desire
15431,CANTO V,"Possess’d me, as soon as these had met my view,"
15432,CANTO V,To know their state. “O born in happy hour!
15433,CANTO V,"Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close"
15434,CANTO V,"Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones"
15435,CANTO V,"Of that eternal triumph, know to us"
15436,CANTO V,"The light communicated, which through heaven"
15437,CANTO V,"Expatiates without bound. Therefore, if aught"
15438,CANTO V,"Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,"
15439,CANTO V,Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill.”
15440,CANTO V,
15441,CANTO V,Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;
15442,CANTO V,And Beatrice next: “Say on; and trust
15443,CANTO V,As unto gods!”—“How in the light supreme
15444,CANTO V,"Thou harbour’st, and from thence the virtue bring’st,"
15445,CANTO V,"That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,"
15446,CANTO V,"l mark; but, who thou art, am still to seek;"
15447,CANTO V,"Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot"
15448,CANTO V,"This sphere assign’d, that oft from mortal ken"
15449,CANTO V,"Is veil’d by others’ beams.” I said, and turn’d"
15450,CANTO V,"Toward the lustre, that with greeting, kind"
15451,CANTO V,Erewhile had hail’d me. Forthwith brighter far
15452,CANTO V,"Than erst, it wax’d: and, as himself the sun"
15453,CANTO V,"Hides through excess of light, when his warm gaze"
15454,CANTO V,Hath on the mantle of thick vapours prey’d;
15455,CANTO V,Within its proper ray the saintly shape
15456,CANTO V,"Was, through increase of gladness, thus conceal’d;"
15457,CANTO V,"And, shrouded so in splendour answer’d me,"
15458,CANTO V,E’en as the tenour of my song declares.
15459,CANTO V,
15460,CANTO V,
15461,CANTO V,

15463,CANTO VI,CANTO VI

15465,CANTO VI,
15466,CANTO VI,“After that Constantine the eagle turn’d
15467,CANTO VI,"Against the motions of the heav’n, that roll’d"
15468,CANTO VI,"Consenting with its course, when he of yore,"
15469,CANTO VI,"Lavinia’s spouse, was leader of the flight,"
15470,CANTO VI,"A hundred years twice told and more, his seat"
15471,CANTO VI,"At Europe’s extreme point, the bird of Jove"
15472,CANTO VI,"Held, near the mountains, whence he issued first."
15473,CANTO VI,"There, under shadow of his sacred plumes"
15474,CANTO VI,"Swaying the world, till through successive hands"
15475,CANTO VI,"To mine he came devolv’d. Caesar I was,"
15476,CANTO VI,And am Justinian; destin’d by the will
15477,CANTO VI,"Of that prime love, whose influence I feel,"
15478,CANTO VI,From vain excess to clear th’ encumber’d laws.
15479,CANTO VI,"Or ere that work engag’d me, I did hold"
15480,CANTO VI,"Christ’s nature merely human, with such faith"
15481,CANTO VI,"Contented. But the blessed Agapete,"
15482,CANTO VI,"Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voice"
15483,CANTO VI,To the true faith recall’d me. I believ’d
15484,CANTO VI,"His words: and what he taught, now plainly see,"
15485,CANTO VI,As thou in every contradiction seest
15486,CANTO VI,The true and false oppos’d. Soon as my feet
15487,CANTO VI,"Were to the church reclaim’d, to my great task,"
15488,CANTO VI,"By inspiration of God’s grace impell’d,"
15489,CANTO VI,"I gave me wholly, and consign’d mine arms"
15490,CANTO VI,"To Belisarius, with whom heaven’s right hand"
15491,CANTO VI,"Was link’d in such conjointment, ’twas a sign"
15492,CANTO VI,That I should rest. To thy first question thus
15493,CANTO VI,"I shape mine answer, which were ended here,"
15494,CANTO VI,But that its tendency doth prompt perforce
15495,CANTO VI,"To some addition; that thou well, mayst mark"
15496,CANTO VI,"What reason on each side they have to plead,"
15497,CANTO VI,"By whom that holiest banner is withstood,"
15498,CANTO VI,Both who pretend its power and who oppose.
15499,CANTO VI,"“Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died"
15500,CANTO VI,"To give it rule, behold the valorous deeds"
15501,CANTO VI,Have made it worthy reverence. Not unknown
15502,CANTO VI,"To thee, how for three hundred years and more"
15503,CANTO VI,"It dwelt in Alba, up to those fell lists"
15504,CANTO VI,Where for its sake were met the rival three;
15505,CANTO VI,"Nor aught unknown to thee, which it achiev’d"
15506,CANTO VI,"Down to the Sabines’ wrong to Lucrece’ woe,"

15510,CANTO VI,"Of single chiefs, or states in league combin’d"
15511,CANTO VI,"Of social warfare; hence Torquatus stern,"
15512,CANTO VI,"And Quintius nam’d of his neglected locks,"

15518,CANTO VI,"Beneath its guidance, in their prime of days"
15519,CANTO VI,"Scipio and Pompey triumph’d; and that hill,"
15520,CANTO VI,"Under whose summit thou didst see the light,"
15521,CANTO VI,"Rued its stern bearing. After, near the hour,"
15522,CANTO VI,When heav’n was minded that o’er all the world
15523,CANTO VI,"His own deep calm should brood, to Caesar’s hand"
15524,CANTO VI,Did Rome consign it; and what then it wrought
15525,CANTO VI,"From Var unto the Rhine, saw Isere’s flood,"
15526,CANTO VI,"Saw Loire and Seine, and every vale, that fills"
15527,CANTO VI,"The torrent Rhone. What after that it wrought,"
15528,CANTO VI,"When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap’d"
15529,CANTO VI,"The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,"
15530,CANTO VI,That tongue nor pen may follow it. Tow’rds Spain
15531,CANTO VI,"It wheel’d its bands, then tow’rd Dyrrachium smote,"
15532,CANTO VI,"And on Pharsalia with so fierce a plunge,"
15533,CANTO VI,E’en the warm Nile was conscious to the pang;
15534,CANTO VI,"Its native shores Antandros, and the streams"
15535,CANTO VI,"Of Simois revisited, and there"
15536,CANTO VI,Where Hector lies; then ill for Ptolemy
15537,CANTO VI,His pennons shook again; lightning thence fell
15538,CANTO VI,"On Juba; and the next upon your west,"
15539,CANTO VI,"At sound of the Pompeian trump, return’d."
15540,CANTO VI,
15541,CANTO VI,“What following and in its next bearer’s gripe

15545,CANTO VI,"Sad Cleopatra, who, pursued by it,"

15547,CANTO VI,With him it ran e’en to the Red Sea coast;
15548,CANTO VI,"With him compos’d the world to such a peace,"
15549,CANTO VI,That of his temple Janus barr’d the door.
15550,CANTO VI,
15551,CANTO VI,"“But all the mighty standard yet had wrought,"
15552,CANTO VI,"And was appointed to perform thereafter,"

15556,CANTO VI,"On the third Caesar look; for to his hands,"
15557,CANTO VI,"The living Justice, in whose breath I move,"
15558,CANTO VI,"Committed glory, e’en into his hands,"

15560,CANTO VI,
15561,CANTO VI,“Hear now and wonder at what next I tell.
15562,CANTO VI,After with Titus it was sent to wreak
15563,CANTO VI,"Vengeance for vengeance of the ancient sin,"
15564,CANTO VI,"And, when the Lombard tooth, with fangs impure,"
15565,CANTO VI,"Did gore the bosom of the holy church,"
15566,CANTO VI,"Under its wings victorious, Charlemagne"
15567,CANTO VI,Sped to her rescue. Judge then for thyself
15568,CANTO VI,"Of those, whom I erewhile accus’d to thee,"
15569,CANTO VI,"What they are, and how grievous their offending,"
15570,CANTO VI,Who are the cause of all your ills. The one

15578,CANTO VI,And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown’d Charles
15579,CANTO VI,"Assail it, but those talons hold in dread,"
15580,CANTO VI,Which from a lion of more lofty port
15581,CANTO VI,Have rent the easing. Many a time ere now
15582,CANTO VI,The sons have for the sire’s transgression wail’d;
15583,CANTO VI,"Nor let him trust the fond belief, that heav’n"

15590,CANTO VI,True love must needs ascend with slacker beam.
15591,CANTO VI,"But it is part of our delight, to measure"
15592,CANTO VI,Our wages with the merit; and admire
15593,CANTO VI,The close proportion. Hence doth heav’nly justice
15594,CANTO VI,"Temper so evenly affection in us,"
15595,CANTO VI,It ne’er can warp to any wrongfulness.
15596,CANTO VI,Of diverse voices is sweet music made:
15597,CANTO VI,So in our life the different degrees
15598,CANTO VI,Render sweet harmony among these wheels.

15604,CANTO VI,"Ill shapes that man his course, who makes his wrong"
15605,CANTO VI,Of other’s worth. Four daughters were there born

15608,CANTO VI,Though of mean state and from a foreign land.
15609,CANTO VI,Yet envious tongues incited him to ask
15610,CANTO VI,"A reckoning of that just one, who return’d"
15611,CANTO VI,Twelve fold to him for ten. Aged and poor
15612,CANTO VI,He parted thence: and if the world did know
15613,CANTO VI,"The heart he had, begging his life by morsels,"
15614,CANTO VI,"’Twould deem the praise, it yields him, scantly dealt.”"
15615,CANTO VI,
15616,CANTO VI,
15617,CANTO VI,

15619,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
15620,CANTO VII,
15621,CANTO VII,
15622,CANTO VII,“Hosanna Sanctus Deus Sabaoth
15623,CANTO VII,Superillustrans claritate tua
15624,CANTO VII,Felices ignes horum malahoth!”
15625,CANTO VII,Thus chanting saw I turn that substance bright
15626,CANTO VII,"With fourfold lustre to its orb again,"
15627,CANTO VII,Revolving; and the rest unto their dance
15628,CANTO VII,"With it mov’d also; and like swiftest sparks,"
15629,CANTO VII,In sudden distance from my sight were veil’d.
15630,CANTO VII,
15631,CANTO VII,"Me doubt possess’d, and “Speak,” it whisper’d me,"
15632,CANTO VII,"“Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench"
15633,CANTO VII,"Thy thirst with drops of sweetness.” Yet blank awe,"
15634,CANTO VII,"Which lords it o’er me, even at the sound"
15635,CANTO VII,"Of Beatrice’s name, did bow me down"
15636,CANTO VII,As one in slumber held. Not long that mood
15637,CANTO VII,"Beatrice suffer’d: she, with such a smile,"
15638,CANTO VII,"As might have made one blest amid the flames,"
15639,CANTO VII,"Beaming upon me, thus her words began:"
15640,CANTO VII,"“Thou in thy thought art pond’ring (as I deem,"
15641,CANTO VII,And what I deem is truth how just revenge
15642,CANTO VII,Could be with justice punish’d: from which doubt
15643,CANTO VII,I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;
15644,CANTO VII,For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.
15645,CANTO VII,
15646,CANTO VII,"“That man, who was unborn, himself condemn’d,"
15647,CANTO VII,"And, in himself, all, who since him have liv’d,"
15648,CANTO VII,"His offspring: whence, below, the human kind"
15649,CANTO VII,Lay sick in grievous error many an age;
15650,CANTO VII,Until it pleas’d the Word of God to come
15651,CANTO VII,"Amongst them down, to his own person joining"
15652,CANTO VII,"The nature, from its Maker far estrang’d,"
15653,CANTO VII,By the mere act of his eternal love.
15654,CANTO VII,Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.
15655,CANTO VII,"The nature with its Maker thus conjoin’d,"
15656,CANTO VII,"Created first was blameless, pure and good;"
15657,CANTO VII,But through itself alone was driven forth
15658,CANTO VII,"From Paradise, because it had eschew’d"
15659,CANTO VII,"The way of truth and life, to evil turn’d."
15660,CANTO VII,Ne’er then was penalty so just as that
15661,CANTO VII,"Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard"
15662,CANTO VII,The nature in assumption doom’d: ne’er wrong
15663,CANTO VII,"So great, in reference to him, who took"
15664,CANTO VII,"Such nature on him, and endur’d the doom."
15665,CANTO VII,God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:
15666,CANTO VII,"So different effects flow’d from one act,"
15667,CANTO VII,"And heav’n was open’d, though the earth did quake."
15668,CANTO VII,"Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear"
15669,CANTO VII,That a just vengeance was by righteous court
15670,CANTO VII,Justly reveng’d. But yet I see thy mind
15671,CANTO VII,"By thought on thought arising sore perplex’d,"
15672,CANTO VII,And with how vehement desire it asks
15673,CANTO VII,"Solution of the maze. What I have heard,"
15674,CANTO VII,"Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way"
15675,CANTO VII,"For our redemption chose, eludes my search."
15676,CANTO VII,
15677,CANTO VII,"“Brother! no eye of man not perfected,"
15678,CANTO VII,"Nor fully ripen’d in the flame of love,"
15679,CANTO VII,"May fathom this decree. It is a mark,"
15680,CANTO VII,"In sooth, much aim’d at, and but little kenn’d:"
15681,CANTO VII,And I will therefore show thee why such way
15682,CANTO VII,"Was worthiest. The celestial love, that spume"
15683,CANTO VII,"All envying in its bounty, in itself"
15684,CANTO VII,"With such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth"
15685,CANTO VII,All beauteous things eternal. What distils
15686,CANTO VII,"Immediate thence, no end of being knows,"
15687,CANTO VII,Bearing its seal immutably impress’d.
15688,CANTO VII,"Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,"
15689,CANTO VII,"Free wholly, uncontrollable by power"
15690,CANTO VII,Of each thing new: by such conformity
15691,CANTO VII,"More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,"
15692,CANTO VII,"Though all partake their shining, yet in those"
15693,CANTO VII,"Are liveliest, which resemble him the most."
15694,CANTO VII,These tokens of pre-eminence on man
15695,CANTO VII,"Largely bestow’d, if any of them fail,"
15696,CANTO VII,"He needs must forfeit his nobility,"
15697,CANTO VII,"No longer stainless. Sin alone is that,"
15698,CANTO VII,"Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike"
15699,CANTO VII,To the chief good; for that its light in him
15700,CANTO VII,Is darken’d. And to dignity thus lost
15701,CANTO VII,"Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,"
15702,CANTO VII,He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.
15703,CANTO VII,"Your nature, which entirely in its seed"
15704,CANTO VII,"Trangress’d, from these distinctions fell, no less"
15705,CANTO VII,Than from its state in Paradise; nor means
15706,CANTO VII,Found of recovery (search all methods out
15707,CANTO VII,"As strickly as thou may) save one of these,"
15708,CANTO VII,"The only fords were left through which to wade,"
15709,CANTO VII,Either that God had of his courtesy
15710,CANTO VII,"Releas’d him merely, or else man himself"
15711,CANTO VII,For his own folly by himself aton’d.
15712,CANTO VII,
15713,CANTO VII,"“Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,"
15714,CANTO VII,"On th’ everlasting counsel, and explore,"
15715,CANTO VII,"Instructed by my words, the dread abyss."
15716,CANTO VII,
15717,CANTO VII,“Man in himself had ever lack’d the means
15718,CANTO VII,"Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop"
15719,CANTO VII,"Obeying, in humility so low,"
15720,CANTO VII,"As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:"
15721,CANTO VII,And for this reason he had vainly tried
15722,CANTO VII,Out of his own sufficiency to pay
15723,CANTO VII,The rigid satisfaction. Then behooved
15724,CANTO VII,That God should by his own ways lead him back
15725,CANTO VII,"Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor’d:"
15726,CANTO VII,"By both his ways, I mean, or one alone."
15727,CANTO VII,"But since the deed is ever priz’d the more,"
15728,CANTO VII,"The more the doer’s good intent appears,"
15729,CANTO VII,"Goodness celestial, whose broad signature"
15730,CANTO VII,"Is on the universe, of all its ways"
15731,CANTO VII,"To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,"
15732,CANTO VII,"Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,"
15733,CANTO VII,Either for him who gave or who receiv’d
15734,CANTO VII,"Between the last night and the primal day,"
15735,CANTO VII,Was or can be. For God more bounty show’d.
15736,CANTO VII,Giving himself to make man capable
15737,CANTO VII,"Of his return to life, than had the terms"
15738,CANTO VII,Been mere and unconditional release.
15739,CANTO VII,"And for his justice, every method else"
15740,CANTO VII,"Were all too scant, had not the Son of God"
15741,CANTO VII,Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh.
15742,CANTO VII,
15743,CANTO VII,"“Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains"
15744,CANTO VII,I somewhat further to thy view unfold.
15745,CANTO VII,That thou mayst see as clearly as myself.
15746,CANTO VII,
15747,CANTO VII,"“I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,"
15748,CANTO VII,"The earth and water, and all things of them"
15749,CANTO VII,"Compounded, to corruption turn, and soon"
15750,CANTO VII,"Dissolve. Yet these were also things create,"
15751,CANTO VII,"Because, if what were told me, had been true"
15752,CANTO VII,They from corruption had been therefore free.
15753,CANTO VII,
15754,CANTO VII,"“The angels, O my brother! and this clime"
15755,CANTO VII,"Wherein thou art, impassible and pure,"
15756,CANTO VII,"I call created, as indeed they are"
15757,CANTO VII,"In their whole being. But the elements,"
15758,CANTO VII,"Which thou hast nam’d, and what of them is made,"
15759,CANTO VII,Are by created virtue’ inform’d: create
15760,CANTO VII,"Their substance, and create the’ informing virtue"
15761,CANTO VII,"In these bright stars, that round them circling move"
15762,CANTO VII,"The soul of every brute and of each plant,"
15763,CANTO VII,"The ray and motion of the sacred lights,"
15764,CANTO VII,With complex potency attract and turn.
15765,CANTO VII,But this our life the’ eternal good inspires
15766,CANTO VII,"Immediate, and enamours of itself;"
15767,CANTO VII,So that our wishes rest for ever here.
15768,CANTO VII,
15769,CANTO VII,“And hence thou mayst by inference conclude
15770,CANTO VII,"Our resurrection certain, if thy mind"
15771,CANTO VII,"Consider how the human flesh was fram’d,"
15772,CANTO VII,When both our parents at the first were made.”
15773,CANTO VII,
15774,CANTO VII,
15775,CANTO VII,
15776,CANTO VII,
15777,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
15778,CANTO VIII,
15779,CANTO VIII,
15780,CANTO VIII,The world was in its day of peril dark
15781,CANTO VIII,Wont to believe the dotage of fond love
15782,CANTO VIII,"From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls"
15783,CANTO VIII,"In her third epicycle, shed on men"
15784,CANTO VIII,By stream of potent radiance: therefore they
15785,CANTO VIII,"Of elder time, in their old error blind,"
15786,CANTO VIII,Not her alone with sacrifice ador’d
15787,CANTO VIII,"And invocation, but like honours paid"
15788,CANTO VIII,"To Cupid and Dione, deem’d of them"
15789,CANTO VIII,"Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign’d"
15790,CANTO VIII,"To sit in Dido’s bosom: and from her,"
15791,CANTO VIII,"Whom I have sung preluding, borrow’d they"
15792,CANTO VIII,"The appellation of that star, which views,"
15793,CANTO VIII,"Now obvious and now averse, the sun."
15794,CANTO VIII,
15795,CANTO VIII,I was not ware that I was wafted up
15796,CANTO VIII,Into its orb; but the new loveliness
15797,CANTO VIII,"That grac’d my lady, gave me ample proof"
15798,CANTO VIII,That we had entered there. And as in flame
15799,CANTO VIII,"A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice"
15800,CANTO VIII,"Discern’d, when one its even tenour keeps,"
15801,CANTO VIII,The other comes and goes; so in that light
15802,CANTO VIII,"I other luminaries saw, that cours’d"
15803,CANTO VIII,"In circling motion. rapid more or less,"
15804,CANTO VIII,As their eternal phases each impels.
15805,CANTO VIII,
15806,CANTO VIII,"Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,"
15807,CANTO VIII,"Whether invisible to eye or no,"
15808,CANTO VIII,"Descended with such speed, it had not seem’d"
15809,CANTO VIII,"To linger in dull tardiness, compar’d"
15810,CANTO VIII,"To those celestial lights, that tow’rds us came,"
15811,CANTO VIII,"Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,"
15812,CANTO VIII,Conducted by the lofty seraphim.
15813,CANTO VIII,"And after them, who in the van appear’d,"
15814,CANTO VIII,"Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left"
15815,CANTO VIII,"Desire, ne’er since extinct in me, to hear"
15816,CANTO VIII,Renew’d the strain. Then parting from the rest
15817,CANTO VIII,"One near us drew, and sole began: “We all"
15818,CANTO VIII,"Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos’d"
15819,CANTO VIII,"To do thee gentle service. We are they,"
15820,CANTO VIII,To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing
15821,CANTO VIII,‘O ye! whose intellectual ministry
15822,CANTO VIII,"Moves the third heaven!’ and in one orb we roll,"
15823,CANTO VIII,"One motion, one impulse, with those who rule"
15824,CANTO VIII,"Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,"
15825,CANTO VIII,That to please thee ’twill be as sweet to rest.”
15826,CANTO VIII,
15827,CANTO VIII,After mine eyes had with meek reverence
15828,CANTO VIII,"Sought the celestial guide, and were by her"
15829,CANTO VIII,"Assur’d, they turn’d again unto the light"
15830,CANTO VIII,"Who had so largely promis’d, and with voice"
15831,CANTO VIII,"That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,"
15832,CANTO VIII,"“Tell who ye are,” I cried. Forthwith it grew"
15833,CANTO VIII,"In size and splendour, through augmented joy;"
15834,CANTO VIII,And thus it answer’d: “A short date below
15835,CANTO VIII,"The world possess’d me. Had the time been more,"
15836,CANTO VIII,"Much evil, that will come, had never chanc’d."
15837,CANTO VIII,"My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine ."
15838,CANTO VIII,"Around, and shroud me, as an animal"
15839,CANTO VIII,"In its own silk enswath’d. Thou lov’dst me well,"
15840,CANTO VIII,And had’st good cause; for had my sojourning
15841,CANTO VIII,"Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee"
15842,CANTO VIII,"Had put forth more than blossoms. The left bank,"
15843,CANTO VIII,"That Rhone, when he hath mix’d with Sorga, laves."
15844,CANTO VIII,"In me its lord expected, and that horn"
15845,CANTO VIII,"Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,"
15846,CANTO VIII,"Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil’d,"
15847,CANTO VIII,"From where the Trento disembogues his waves,"
15848,CANTO VIII,"With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood."
15849,CANTO VIII,"Already on my temples beam’d the crown,"
15850,CANTO VIII,Which gave me sov’reignty over the land
15851,CANTO VIII,"By Danube wash’d, whenas he strays beyond"
15852,CANTO VIII,"The limits of his German shores. The realm,"
15853,CANTO VIII,"Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash’d,"
15854,CANTO VIII,"Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,"
15855,CANTO VIII,The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom
15856,CANTO VIII,"(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap’ry cloud"
15857,CANTO VIII,"Bituminous upsteam’d), THAT too did look"
15858,CANTO VIII,To have its scepter wielded by a race
15859,CANTO VIII,"Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;"
15860,CANTO VIII,had not ill lording which doth spirit up
15861,CANTO VIII,"The people ever, in Palermo rais’d"
15862,CANTO VIII,"The shout of ‘death,’ re-echo’d loud and long."
15863,CANTO VIII,"Had but my brother’s foresight kenn’d as much,"
15864,CANTO VIII,He had been warier that the greedy want
15865,CANTO VIII,Of Catalonia might not work his bale.
15866,CANTO VIII,"And truly need there is, that he forecast,"
15867,CANTO VIII,"Or other for him, lest more freight be laid"
15868,CANTO VIII,On his already over-laden bark.
15869,CANTO VIII,"Nature in him, from bounty fall’n to thrift,"
15870,CANTO VIII,"Would ask the guard of braver arms, than such"
15871,CANTO VIII,As only care to have their coffers fill’d.”
15872,CANTO VIII,
15873,CANTO VIII,"“My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words"
15874,CANTO VIII,"Infuse into me, mighty as it is,"
15875,CANTO VIII,"To think my gladness manifest to thee,"
15876,CANTO VIII,"As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst"
15877,CANTO VIII,"Into the source and limit of all good,"
15878,CANTO VIII,"There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,"
15879,CANTO VIII,Thence priz’d of me the more. Glad thou hast made me.
15880,CANTO VIII,"Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt"
15881,CANTO VIII,"Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,"
15882,CANTO VIII,"How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.”"
15883,CANTO VIII,
15884,CANTO VIII,I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:
15885,CANTO VIII,"“If I have power to show one truth, soon that"
15886,CANTO VIII,"Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares"
15887,CANTO VIII,"Behind thee now conceal’d. The Good, that guides"
15888,CANTO VIII,"And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,"
15889,CANTO VIII,Ordains its providence to be the virtue
15890,CANTO VIII,In these great bodies: nor th’ all perfect Mind
15891,CANTO VIII,"Upholds their nature merely, but in them"
15892,CANTO VIII,"Their energy to save: for nought, that lies"
15893,CANTO VIII,"Within the range of that unerring bow,"
15894,CANTO VIII,"But is as level with the destin’d aim,"
15895,CANTO VIII,As ever mark to arrow’s point oppos’d.
15896,CANTO VIII,"Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,"
15897,CANTO VIII,"Would their effect so work, it would not be"
15898,CANTO VIII,"Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,"
15899,CANTO VIII,"If th’ intellectual powers, that move these stars,"
15900,CANTO VIII,"Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail."
15901,CANTO VIII,Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc’d?”
15902,CANTO VIII,
15903,CANTO VIII,"To whom I thus: “It is enough: no fear,"
15904,CANTO VIII,"I see, lest nature in her part should tire.”"
15905,CANTO VIII,
15906,CANTO VIII,"He straight rejoin’d: “Say, were it worse for man,"
15907,CANTO VIII,If he liv’d not in fellowship on earth?”
15908,CANTO VIII,
15909,CANTO VIII,"“Yea,” answer’d I; “nor here a reason needs.”"
15910,CANTO VIII,
15911,CANTO VIII,"“And may that be, if different estates"
15912,CANTO VIII,Grow not of different duties in your life?
15913,CANTO VIII,"Consult your teacher, and he tells you ‘no.’”"
15914,CANTO VIII,
15915,CANTO VIII,"Thus did he come, deducing to this point,"
15916,CANTO VIII,"And then concluded: “For this cause behooves,"
15917,CANTO VIII,"The roots, from whence your operations come,"
15918,CANTO VIII,Must differ. Therefore one is Solon born;
15919,CANTO VIII,"Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec"
15920,CANTO VIII,"A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage"
15921,CANTO VIII,"Cost him his son. In her circuitous course,"
15922,CANTO VIII,"Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,"
15923,CANTO VIII,"Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns"
15924,CANTO VIII,’Twixt one or other household. Hence befalls
15925,CANTO VIII,That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence
15926,CANTO VIII,"Quirinus of so base a father springs,"
15927,CANTO VIII,He dates from Mars his lineage. Were it not
15928,CANTO VIII,"That providence celestial overrul’d,"
15929,CANTO VIII,"Nature, in generation, must the path"
15930,CANTO VIII,"Trac’d by the generator, still pursue"
15931,CANTO VIII,Unswervingly. Thus place I in thy sight
15932,CANTO VIII,"That, which was late behind thee. But, in sign"
15933,CANTO VIII,"Of more affection for thee, ’tis my will"
15934,CANTO VIII,Thou wear this corollary. Nature ever
15935,CANTO VIII,"Finding discordant fortune, like all seed"
15936,CANTO VIII,"Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill."
15937,CANTO VIII,And were the world below content to mark
15938,CANTO VIII,"And work on the foundation nature lays,"
15939,CANTO VIII,It would not lack supply of excellence.
15940,CANTO VIII,But ye perversely to religion strain
15941,CANTO VIII,"Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,"
15942,CANTO VIII,And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;
15943,CANTO VIII,Therefore your steps have wander’d from the paths.”
15944,CANTO VIII,

15949,CANTO IX,
15950,CANTO IX,
15951,CANTO IX,"After solution of my doubt, thy Charles,"
15952,CANTO IX,"O fair Clemenza, of the treachery spake"
15953,CANTO IX,"That must befall his seed: but, “Tell it not,”"
15954,CANTO IX,"Said he, “and let the destin’d years come round.”"
15955,CANTO IX,"Nor may I tell thee more, save that the meed"
15956,CANTO IX,Of sorrow well-deserv’d shall quit your wrongs.
15957,CANTO IX,
15958,CANTO IX,And now the visage of that saintly light
15959,CANTO IX,"Was to the sun, that fills it, turn’d again,"
15960,CANTO IX,"As to the good, whose plenitude of bliss"
15961,CANTO IX,Sufficeth all. O ye misguided souls!
15962,CANTO IX,"Infatuate, who from such a good estrange"
15963,CANTO IX,"Your hearts, and bend your gaze on vanity,"
15964,CANTO IX,"Alas for you!—And lo! toward me, next,"
15965,CANTO IX,"Another of those splendent forms approach’d,"
15966,CANTO IX,"That, by its outward bright’ning, testified"
15967,CANTO IX,The will it had to pleasure me. The eyes
15968,CANTO IX,"Of Beatrice, resting, as before,"
15969,CANTO IX,"Firmly upon me, manifested forth"
15970,CANTO IX,"Approva1 of my wish. “And O,” I cried,"
15971,CANTO IX,Blest spirit! quickly be my will perform’d;
15972,CANTO IX,"And prove thou to me, that my inmost thoughts"
15973,CANTO IX,"I can reflect on thee.” Thereat the light,"
15974,CANTO IX,"That yet was new to me, from the recess,"
15975,CANTO IX,"Where it before was singing, thus began,"
15976,CANTO IX,As one who joys in kindness: “In that part
15977,CANTO IX,"Of the deprav’d Italian land, which lies"
15978,CANTO IX,"Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs"
15979,CANTO IX,"Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,"
15980,CANTO IX,"But to no lofty eminence, a hill,"
15981,CANTO IX,"From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,"
15982,CANTO IX,That sorely sheet the region. From one root
15983,CANTO IX,I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:
15984,CANTO IX,"And here I glitter, for that by its light"
15985,CANTO IX,"This star o’ercame me. Yet I naught repine,"
15986,CANTO IX,"Nor grudge myself the cause of this my lot,"
15987,CANTO IX,Which haply vulgar hearts can scarce conceive.
15988,CANTO IX,
15989,CANTO IX,"“This jewel, that is next me in our heaven,"
15990,CANTO IX,"Lustrous and costly, great renown hath left,"
15991,CANTO IX,"And not to perish, ere these hundred years"
15992,CANTO IX,"Five times absolve their round. Consider thou,"
15993,CANTO IX,"If to excel be worthy man’s endeavour,"
15994,CANTO IX,When such life may attend the first. Yet they
15995,CANTO IX,"Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt"
15996,CANTO IX,"By Adice and Tagliamento, still"
15997,CANTO IX,"Impenitent, tho’ scourg’d. The hour is near,"
15998,CANTO IX,When for their stubbornness at Padua’s marsh
15999,CANTO IX,"The water shall be chang’d, that laves Vicena"
16000,CANTO IX,"And where Cagnano meets with Sile, one"
16001,CANTO IX,"Lords it, and bears his head aloft, for whom"
16002,CANTO IX,The web is now a-warping. Feltro too
16003,CANTO IX,"Shall sorrow for its godless shepherd’s fault,"
16004,CANTO IX,"Of so deep stain, that never, for the like,"
16005,CANTO IX,Was Malta’s bar unclos’d. Too large should be
16006,CANTO IX,"The skillet, that would hold Ferrara’s blood,"
16007,CANTO IX,"And wearied he, who ounce by ounce would weight it,"
16008,CANTO IX,"The which this priest, in show of party-zeal,"
16009,CANTO IX,Courteous will give; nor will the gift ill suit
16010,CANTO IX,"The country’s custom. We descry above,"
16011,CANTO IX,"Mirrors, ye call them thrones, from which to us"
16012,CANTO IX,Reflected shine the judgments of our God:
16013,CANTO IX,Whence these our sayings we avouch for good.”
16014,CANTO IX,
16015,CANTO IX,"She ended, and appear’d on other thoughts"
16016,CANTO IX,"Intent, re-ent’ring on the wheel she late"
16017,CANTO IX,Had left. That other joyance meanwhile wax’d
16018,CANTO IX,"A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,"
16019,CANTO IX,"Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,"
16020,CANTO IX,"For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes"
16021,CANTO IX,"Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,"
16022,CANTO IX,"As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade."
16023,CANTO IX,
16024,CANTO IX,"“God seeth all: and in him is thy sight,”"
16025,CANTO IX,"Said I, “blest Spirit! Therefore will of his"
16026,CANTO IX,Cannot to thee be dark. Why then delays
16027,CANTO IX,"Thy voice to satisfy my wish untold,"
16028,CANTO IX,"That voice which joins the inexpressive song,"
16029,CANTO IX,"Pastime of heav’n, the which those ardours sing,"
16030,CANTO IX,That cowl them with six shadowing wings outspread?
16031,CANTO IX,"I would not wait thy asking, wert thou known"
16032,CANTO IX,"To me, as thoroughly I to thee am known.”"
16033,CANTO IX,
16034,CANTO IX,"He forthwith answ’ring, thus his words began:"
16035,CANTO IX,"“The valley’ of waters, widest next to that"
16036,CANTO IX,"Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,"
16037,CANTO IX,"Between discordant shores, against the sun"
16038,CANTO IX,"Inward so far, it makes meridian there,"
16039,CANTO IX,Where was before th’ horizon. Of that vale
16040,CANTO IX,"Dwelt I upon the shore, ’twixt Ebro’s stream"
16041,CANTO IX,"And Macra’s, that divides with passage brief"
16042,CANTO IX,Genoan bounds from Tuscan. East and west
16043,CANTO IX,"Are nearly one to Begga and my land,"
16044,CANTO IX,Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.
16045,CANTO IX,Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:
16046,CANTO IX,"And I did bear impression of this heav’n,"
16047,CANTO IX,That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame
16048,CANTO IX,"Glow’d Belus’ daughter, injuring alike"
16049,CANTO IX,"Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,"
16050,CANTO IX,Long as it suited the unripen’d down
16051,CANTO IX,"That fledg’d my cheek: nor she of Rhodope,"
16052,CANTO IX,That was beguiled of Demophoon;
16053,CANTO IX,"Nor Jove’s son, when the charms of Iole"
16054,CANTO IX,Were shrin’d within his heart. And yet there hides
16055,CANTO IX,"No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,"
16056,CANTO IX,"Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),"
16057,CANTO IX,"But for the virtue, whose o’erruling sway"
16058,CANTO IX,And providence have wrought thus quaintly. Here
16059,CANTO IX,"The skill is look’d into, that fashioneth"
16060,CANTO IX,"With such effectual working, and the good"
16061,CANTO IX,"Discern’d, accruing to this upper world"
16062,CANTO IX,From that below. But fully to content
16063,CANTO IX,"Thy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,"
16064,CANTO IX,"Demands my further parle. Inquire thou wouldst,"
16065,CANTO IX,"Who of this light is denizen, that here"
16066,CANTO IX,"Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth"
16067,CANTO IX,"On the clear wave. Know then, the soul of Rahab"
16068,CANTO IX,"Is in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe"
16069,CANTO IX,"United, and the foremost rank assign’d."
16070,CANTO IX,"He to that heav’n, at which the shadow ends"
16071,CANTO IX,"Of your sublunar world, was taken up,"
16072,CANTO IX,"First, in Christ’s triumph, of all souls redeem’d:"
16073,CANTO IX,"For well behoov’d, that, in some part of heav’n,"
16074,CANTO IX,"She should remain a trophy, to declare"
16075,CANTO IX,The mighty contest won with either palm;
16076,CANTO IX,For that she favour’d first the high exploit
16077,CANTO IX,"Of Joshua on the holy land, whereof"
16078,CANTO IX,"The Pope recks little now. Thy city, plant"
16079,CANTO IX,"Of him, that on his Maker turn’d the back,"
16080,CANTO IX,"And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,"
16081,CANTO IX,"Engenders and expands the cursed flower,"
16082,CANTO IX,"That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,"
16083,CANTO IX,"Turning the shepherd to a wolf. For this,"
16084,CANTO IX,"The gospel and great teachers laid aside,"
16085,CANTO IX,"The decretals, as their stuft margins show,"
16086,CANTO IX,"Are the sole study. Pope and Cardinals,"
16087,CANTO IX,"Intent on these, ne’er journey but in thought"
16088,CANTO IX,"To Nazareth, where Gabriel op’d his wings."
16089,CANTO IX,"Yet it may chance, erelong, the Vatican,"
16090,CANTO IX,"And other most selected parts of Rome,"
16091,CANTO IX,"That were the grave of Peter’s soldiery,"
16092,CANTO IX,Shall be deliver’d from the adult’rous bond.”
16093,CANTO IX,

16096,CANTO IX,
16097,CANTO X,CANTO X
16098,CANTO X,
16099,CANTO X,
16100,CANTO X,"Looking into his first-born with the love,"
16101,CANTO X,"Which breathes from both eternal, the first Might"
16102,CANTO X,"Ineffable, whence eye or mind"
16103,CANTO X,"Can roam, hath in such order all dispos’d,"
16104,CANTO X,"As none may see and fail to’ enjoy. Raise, then,"
16105,CANTO X,"O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,"
16106,CANTO X,"Thy ken directed to the point, whereat"
16107,CANTO X,One motion strikes on th’ other. There begin
16108,CANTO X,"Thy wonder of the mighty Architect,"
16109,CANTO X,"Who loves his work so inwardly, his eye"
16110,CANTO X,"Doth ever watch it. See, how thence oblique"
16111,CANTO X,"Brancheth the circle, where the planets roll"
16112,CANTO X,To pour their wished influence on the world;
16113,CANTO X,"Whose path not bending thus, in heav’n above"
16114,CANTO X,"Much virtue would be lost, and here on earth,"
16115,CANTO X,"All power well nigh extinct: or, from direct"
16116,CANTO X,"Were its departure distant more or less,"
16117,CANTO X,"I’ th’ universal order, great defect"
16118,CANTO X,"Must, both in heav’n and here beneath, ensue."
16119,CANTO X,
16120,CANTO X,"Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse"
16121,CANTO X,Anticipative of the feast to come;
16122,CANTO X,So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.
16123,CANTO X,"Lo! I have set before thee, for thyself"
16124,CANTO X,"Feed now: the matter I indite, henceforth"
16125,CANTO X,"Demands entire my thought. Join’d with the part,"
16126,CANTO X,"Which late we told of, the great minister"
16127,CANTO X,"Of nature, that upon the world imprints"
16128,CANTO X,"The virtue of the heaven, and doles out"
16129,CANTO X,"Time for us with his beam, went circling on"
16130,CANTO X,"Along the spires, where each hour sooner comes;"
16131,CANTO X,"And I was with him, weetless of ascent,"
16132,CANTO X,"As one, who till arriv’d, weets not his coming."
16133,CANTO X,
16134,CANTO X,"For Beatrice, she who passeth on"
16135,CANTO X,"So suddenly from good to better, time"
16136,CANTO X,"Counts not the act, oh then how great must needs"
16137,CANTO X,Have been her brightness! What she was i’ th’ sun
16138,CANTO X,"(Where I had enter’d), not through change of hue,"
16139,CANTO X,But light transparent—did I summon up
16140,CANTO X,"Genius, art, practice—I might not so speak,"
16141,CANTO X,It should be e’er imagin’d: yet believ’d
16142,CANTO X,"It may be, and the sight be justly crav’d."
16143,CANTO X,"And if our fantasy fail of such height,"
16144,CANTO X,"What marvel, since no eye above the sun"
16145,CANTO X,"Hath ever travel’d? Such are they dwell here,"
16146,CANTO X,"Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,"
16147,CANTO X,Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;
16148,CANTO X,And holds them still enraptur’d with the view.
16149,CANTO X,"And thus to me Beatrice: “Thank, oh thank,"
16150,CANTO X,"The Sun of angels, him, who by his grace"
16151,CANTO X,To this perceptible hath lifted thee.”
16152,CANTO X,
16153,CANTO X,"Never was heart in such devotion bound,"
16154,CANTO X,And with complacency so absolute
16155,CANTO X,"Dispos’d to render up itself to God,"
16156,CANTO X,As mine was at those words: and so entire
16157,CANTO X,"The love for Him, that held me, it eclips’d"
16158,CANTO X,Beatrice in oblivion. Naught displeas’d
16159,CANTO X,"Was she, but smil’d thereat so joyously,"
16160,CANTO X,That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake
16161,CANTO X,And scatter’d my collected mind abroad.
16162,CANTO X,
16163,CANTO X,"Then saw I a bright band, in liveliness"
16164,CANTO X,"Surpassing, who themselves did make the crown,"
16165,CANTO X,"And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,"
16166,CANTO X,"Than in their visage beaming. Cinctur’d thus,"
16167,CANTO X,"Sometime Latona’s daughter we behold,"
16168,CANTO X,"When the impregnate air retains the thread,"
16169,CANTO X,"That weaves her zone. In the celestial court,"
16170,CANTO X,"Whence I return, are many jewels found,"
16171,CANTO X,"So dear and beautiful, they cannot brook"
16172,CANTO X,Transporting from that realm: and of these lights
16173,CANTO X,Such was the song. Who doth not prune his wing
16174,CANTO X,"To soar up thither, let him look from thence"
16175,CANTO X,"For tidings from the dumb. When, singing thus,"
16176,CANTO X,"Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,"
16177,CANTO X,"As nearest stars around the fixed pole,"
16178,CANTO X,"Then seem’d they like to ladies, from the dance"
16179,CANTO X,"Not ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,"
16180,CANTO X,"List’ning, till they have caught the strain anew:"
16181,CANTO X,"Suspended so they stood: and, from within,"
16182,CANTO X,"Thus heard I one, who spake: “Since with its beam"
16183,CANTO X,"The grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,"
16184,CANTO X,"That after doth increase by loving, shines"
16185,CANTO X,"So multiplied in thee, it leads thee up"
16186,CANTO X,"Along this ladder, down whose hallow’d steps"
16187,CANTO X,"None e’er descend, and mount them not again,"
16188,CANTO X,Who from his phial should refuse thee wine
16189,CANTO X,"To slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,"
16190,CANTO X,Than water flowing not unto the sea.
16191,CANTO X,"Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom"
16192,CANTO X,"In the bright garland, which, admiring, girds"
16193,CANTO X,"This fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav’n."
16194,CANTO X,"I then was of the lambs, that Dominic"
16195,CANTO X,"Leads, for his saintly flock, along the way,"
16196,CANTO X,"Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity."
16197,CANTO X,"He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,"
16198,CANTO X,And master to me: Albert of Cologne
16199,CANTO X,"Is this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I."
16200,CANTO X,"If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur’d,"
16201,CANTO X,"Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,"
16202,CANTO X,In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.
16203,CANTO X,That next resplendence issues from the smile
16204,CANTO X,"Of Gratian, who to either forum lent"
16205,CANTO X,"Such help, as favour wins in Paradise."
16206,CANTO X,"The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,"
16207,CANTO X,"Was Peter, he that with the widow gave"
16208,CANTO X,"To holy church his treasure. The fifth light,"
16209,CANTO X,"Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,"
16210,CANTO X,That all your world craves tidings of its doom:
16211,CANTO X,"Within, there is the lofty light, endow’d"
16212,CANTO X,"With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,"
16213,CANTO X,That with a ken of such wide amplitude
16214,CANTO X,No second hath arisen. Next behold
16215,CANTO X,"That taper’s radiance, to whose view was shown,"
16216,CANTO X,"Clearliest, the nature and the ministry"
16217,CANTO X,"Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt."
16218,CANTO X,In the other little light serenely smiles
16219,CANTO X,"That pleader for the Christian temples, he"
16220,CANTO X,Who did provide Augustin of his lore.
16221,CANTO X,"Now, if thy mind’s eye pass from light to light,"
16222,CANTO X,"Upon my praises following, of the eighth"
16223,CANTO X,"Thy thirst is next. The saintly soul, that shows"
16224,CANTO X,"The world’s deceitfulness, to all who hear him,"
16225,CANTO X,"Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,"
16226,CANTO X,"Blest there. The limbs, whence it was driven, lie"
16227,CANTO X,"Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom"
16228,CANTO X,"And exile came it here. Lo! further on,"
16229,CANTO X,"Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,"
16230,CANTO X,"Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,"
16231,CANTO X,"In deep discernment. Lastly this, from whom"
16232,CANTO X,"Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam"
16233,CANTO X,"Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,"
16234,CANTO X,Rebuk’d the ling’ring tardiness of death.
16235,CANTO X,"It is the eternal light of Sigebert,"
16236,CANTO X,"Who ’scap’d not envy, when of truth he argued,"
16237,CANTO X,"Reading in the straw-litter’d street.” Forthwith,"
16238,CANTO X,"As clock, that calleth up the spouse of God"
16239,CANTO X,"To win her bridegroom’s love at matin’s hour,"
16240,CANTO X,"Each part of other fitly drawn and urg’d,"
16241,CANTO X,"Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,"
16242,CANTO X,Affection springs in well-disposed breast;
16243,CANTO X,"Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard"
16244,CANTO X,"Voice answ’ring voice, so musical and soft,"
16245,CANTO X,It can be known but where day endless shines.

16251,CANTO XI,
16252,CANTO XI,
16253,CANTO XI,O fond anxiety of mortal men!
16254,CANTO XI,How vain and inconclusive arguments
16255,CANTO XI,"Are those, which make thee beat thy wings below"
16256,CANTO XI,"For statues one, and one for aphorisms"
16257,CANTO XI,"Was hunting; this the priesthood follow’d, that"
16258,CANTO XI,By force or sophistry aspir’d to rule;
16259,CANTO XI,"To rob another, and another sought"
16260,CANTO XI,By civil business wealth; one moiling lay
16261,CANTO XI,"Tangled in net of sensual delight,"
16262,CANTO XI,And one to witless indolence resign’d;
16263,CANTO XI,"What time from all these empty things escap’d,"
16264,CANTO XI,"With Beatrice, I thus gloriously"
16265,CANTO XI,"Was rais’d aloft, and made the guest of heav’n."
16266,CANTO XI,
16267,CANTO XI,"They of the circle to that point, each one."
16268,CANTO XI,"Where erst it was, had turn’d; and steady glow’d,"
16269,CANTO XI,As candle in his socket. Then within
16270,CANTO XI,"The lustre, that erewhile bespake me, smiling"
16271,CANTO XI,"With merer gladness, heard I thus begin:"
16272,CANTO XI,
16273,CANTO XI,"“E’en as his beam illumes me, so I look"
16274,CANTO XI,"Into the eternal light, and clearly mark"
16275,CANTO XI,"Thy thoughts, from whence they rise. Thou art in doubt,"
16276,CANTO XI,"And wouldst, that I should bolt my words afresh"
16277,CANTO XI,"In such plain open phrase, as may be smooth"
16278,CANTO XI,"To thy perception, where I told thee late"
16279,CANTO XI,That ‘well they thrive;’ and that ‘no second such
16280,CANTO XI,"Hath risen,’ which no small distinction needs."
16281,CANTO XI,
16282,CANTO XI,"“The providence, that governeth the world,"
16283,CANTO XI,In depth of counsel by created ken
16284,CANTO XI,"Unfathomable, to the end that she,"
16285,CANTO XI,"Who with loud cries was ’spous’d in precious blood,"
16286,CANTO XI,"Might keep her footing towards her well-belov’d,"
16287,CANTO XI,"Safe in herself and constant unto him,"
16288,CANTO XI,"Hath two ordain’d, who should on either hand"
16289,CANTO XI,In chief escort her: one seraphic all
16290,CANTO XI,"In fervency; for wisdom upon earth,"
16291,CANTO XI,The other splendour of cherubic light.
16292,CANTO XI,"I but of one will tell: he tells of both,"
16293,CANTO XI,Who one commendeth. which of them so’er
16294,CANTO XI,Be taken: for their deeds were to one end.
16295,CANTO XI,
16296,CANTO XI,"“Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls"
16297,CANTO XI,"From blest Ubaldo’s chosen hill, there hangs"
16298,CANTO XI,"Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold"
16299,CANTO XI,Are wafted through Perugia’s eastern gate:
16300,CANTO XI,"And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear"
16301,CANTO XI,"Mourn for their heavy yoke. Upon that side,"
16302,CANTO XI,"Where it doth break its steepness most, arose"
16303,CANTO XI,"A sun upon the world, as duly this"
16304,CANTO XI,"From Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak"
16305,CANTO XI,"Of that place, say Ascesi; for its name"
16306,CANTO XI,"Were lamely so deliver’d; but the East,"
16307,CANTO XI,"To call things rightly, be it henceforth styl’d."
16308,CANTO XI,"He was not yet much distant from his rising,"
16309,CANTO XI,When his good influence ’gan to bless the earth.
16310,CANTO XI,A dame to whom none openeth pleasure’s gate
16311,CANTO XI,"More than to death, was, ’gainst his father’s will,"

16313,CANTO XI,"Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,"
16314,CANTO XI,"And in his father’s sight: from day to day,"
16315,CANTO XI,"Then lov’d her more devoutly. She, bereav’d"
16316,CANTO XI,"Of her first husband, slighted and obscure,"
16317,CANTO XI,"Thousand and hundred years and more, remain’d"
16318,CANTO XI,"Without a single suitor, till he came."
16319,CANTO XI,"Nor aught avail’d, that, with Amyclas, she"
16320,CANTO XI,"Was found unmov’d at rumour of his voice,"
16321,CANTO XI,Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness
16322,CANTO XI,"Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,"
16323,CANTO XI,When Mary stay’d beneath. But not to deal
16324,CANTO XI,"Thus closely with thee longer, take at large"
16325,CANTO XI,The rovers’ titles—Poverty and Francis.
16326,CANTO XI,"Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,"
16327,CANTO XI,"And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,"
16328,CANTO XI,"So much, that venerable Bernard first"
16329,CANTO XI,"Did bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace"
16330,CANTO XI,"So heavenly, ran, yet deem’d his footing slow."
16331,CANTO XI,O hidden riches! O prolific good!
16332,CANTO XI,"Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,"
16333,CANTO XI,And follow both the bridegroom; so the bride
16334,CANTO XI,"Can please them. Thenceforth goes he on his way,"
16335,CANTO XI,"The father and the master, with his spouse,"
16336,CANTO XI,"And with that family, whom now the cord"
16337,CANTO XI,Girt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart
16338,CANTO XI,"Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son"
16339,CANTO XI,"Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men"
16340,CANTO XI,In wond’rous sort despis’d. But royally
16341,CANTO XI,His hard intention he to Innocent
16342,CANTO XI,"Set forth, and from him first receiv’d the seal"
16343,CANTO XI,"On his religion. Then, when numerous flock’d"
16344,CANTO XI,"The tribe of lowly ones, that trac’d HIS steps,"
16345,CANTO XI,Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung
16346,CANTO XI,"In heights empyreal, through Honorius’ hand"
16347,CANTO XI,"A second crown, to deck their Guardian’s virtues,"
16348,CANTO XI,Was by the eternal Spirit inwreath’d: and when
16349,CANTO XI,"He had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up"
16350,CANTO XI,"In the proud Soldan’s presence, and there preach’d"
16351,CANTO XI,Christ and his followers; but found the race
16352,CANTO XI,Unripen’d for conversion: back once more
16353,CANTO XI,"He hasted (not to intermit his toil),"
16354,CANTO XI,"And reap’d Ausonian lands. On the hard rock,"
16355,CANTO XI,"’Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ"
16356,CANTO XI,"Took the last Signet, which his limbs two years"
16357,CANTO XI,"Did carry. Then the season come, that he,"
16358,CANTO XI,"Who to such good had destin’d him, was pleas’d"
16359,CANTO XI,"T’ advance him to the meed, which he had earn’d"
16360,CANTO XI,"By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,"
16361,CANTO XI,"As their just heritage, he gave in charge"
16362,CANTO XI,"His dearest lady, and enjoin’d their love"
16363,CANTO XI,"And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will’d"
16364,CANTO XI,"His goodly spirit should move forth, returning"
16365,CANTO XI,"To its appointed kingdom, nor would have"
16366,CANTO XI,His body laid upon another bier.
16367,CANTO XI,
16368,CANTO XI,"“Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,"
16369,CANTO XI,To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea
16370,CANTO XI,Helm’d to right point; and such our Patriarch was.
16371,CANTO XI,"Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,"
16372,CANTO XI,"Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in."
16373,CANTO XI,"But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,"
16374,CANTO XI,So that they needs into strange pastures wide
16375,CANTO XI,Must spread them: and the more remote from him
16376,CANTO XI,"The stragglers wander, so much mole they come"
16377,CANTO XI,"Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk."
16378,CANTO XI,"There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,"
16379,CANTO XI,"And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,"
16380,CANTO XI,A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.
16381,CANTO XI,
16382,CANTO XI,"“Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta’en"
16383,CANTO XI,"Good heed, if that, which I have told, recall"
16384,CANTO XI,"To mind, thy wish may be in part fulfill’d:"
16385,CANTO XI,"For thou wilt see the point from whence they split,"
16386,CANTO XI,"Nor miss of the reproof, which that implies,"
16387,CANTO XI,‘That well they thrive not sworn with vanity.’”

16393,CANTO XII,
16394,CANTO XII,
16395,CANTO XII,Soon as its final word the blessed flame
16396,CANTO XII,"Had rais’d for utterance, straight the holy mill"
16397,CANTO XII,"Began to wheel, nor yet had once revolv’d,"
16398,CANTO XII,"Or ere another, circling, compass’d it,"
16399,CANTO XII,"Motion to motion, song to song, conjoining,"
16400,CANTO XII,"Song, that as much our muses doth excel,"
16401,CANTO XII,"Our Sirens with their tuneful pipes, as ray"
16402,CANTO XII,Of primal splendour doth its faint reflex.
16403,CANTO XII,
16404,CANTO XII,"As when, if Juno bid her handmaid forth,"
16405,CANTO XII,"Two arches parallel, and trick’d alike,"
16406,CANTO XII,"Span the thin cloud, the outer taking birth"
16407,CANTO XII,From that within (in manner of that voice
16408,CANTO XII,"Whom love did melt away, as sun the mist),"
16409,CANTO XII,"And they who gaze, presageful call to mind"
16410,CANTO XII,"The compact, made with Noah, of the world"
16411,CANTO XII,No more to be o’erflow’d; about us thus
16412,CANTO XII,"Of sempiternal roses, bending, wreath’d"
16413,CANTO XII,"Those garlands twain, and to the innermost"
16414,CANTO XII,"E’en thus th’ external answered. When the footing,"
16415,CANTO XII,"And other great festivity, of song,"
16416,CANTO XII,"And radiance, light with light accordant, each"
16417,CANTO XII,"Jocund and blythe, had at their pleasure still’d"
16418,CANTO XII,"(E’en as the eyes by quick volition mov’d,"
16419,CANTO XII,"Are shut and rais’d together), from the heart"
16420,CANTO XII,"Of one amongst the new lights mov’d a voice,"
16421,CANTO XII,"That made me seem like needle to the star,"
16422,CANTO XII,"In turning to its whereabout, and thus"
16423,CANTO XII,"Began: “The love, that makes me beautiful,"
16424,CANTO XII,"Prompts me to tell of th’ other guide, for whom"
16425,CANTO XII,"Such good of mine is spoken. Where one is,"
16426,CANTO XII,The other worthily should also be;
16427,CANTO XII,"That as their warfare was alike, alike"
16428,CANTO XII,"Should be their glory. Slow, and full of doubt,"
16429,CANTO XII,"And with thin ranks, after its banner mov’d"
16430,CANTO XII,The army of Christ (which it so clearly cost
16431,CANTO XII,"To reappoint), when its imperial Head,"
16432,CANTO XII,"Who reigneth ever, for the drooping host"
16433,CANTO XII,"Did make provision, thorough grace alone,"
16434,CANTO XII,"And not through its deserving. As thou heard’st,"
16435,CANTO XII,Two champions to the succour of his spouse
16436,CANTO XII,"He sent, who by their deeds and words might join"
16437,CANTO XII,"Again his scatter’d people. In that clime,"
16438,CANTO XII,Where springs the pleasant west-wind to unfold
16439,CANTO XII,"The fresh leaves, with which Europe sees herself"
16440,CANTO XII,"New-garmented; nor from those billows far,"
16441,CANTO XII,"Beyond whose chiding, after weary course,"
16442,CANTO XII,"The sun doth sometimes hide him, safe abides"
16443,CANTO XII,"The happy Callaroga, under guard"
16444,CANTO XII,"Of the great shield, wherein the lion lies"
16445,CANTO XII,Subjected and supreme. And there was born
16446,CANTO XII,"The loving million of the Christian faith,"
16447,CANTO XII,"The hollow’d wrestler, gentle to his own,"
16448,CANTO XII,And to his enemies terrible. So replete
16449,CANTO XII,"His soul with lively virtue, that when first"
16450,CANTO XII,"Created, even in the mother’s womb,"
16451,CANTO XII,"It prophesied. When, at the sacred font,"
16452,CANTO XII,"The spousals were complete ’twixt faith and him,"
16453,CANTO XII,"Where pledge of mutual safety was exchang’d,"
16454,CANTO XII,"The dame, who was his surety, in her sleep"
16455,CANTO XII,"Beheld the wondrous fruit, that was from him"
16456,CANTO XII,And from his heirs to issue. And that such
16457,CANTO XII,"He might be construed, as indeed he was,"
16458,CANTO XII,"She was inspir’d to name him of his owner,"
16459,CANTO XII,"Whose he was wholly, and so call’d him Dominic."
16460,CANTO XII,"And I speak of him, as the labourer,"
16461,CANTO XII,Whom Christ in his own garden chose to be
16462,CANTO XII,"His help-mate. Messenger he seem’d, and friend"
16463,CANTO XII,"Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show’d,"
16464,CANTO XII,Was after the first counsel that Christ gave.
16465,CANTO XII,"Many a time his nurse, at entering found"
16466,CANTO XII,"That he had ris’n in silence, and was prostrate,"
16467,CANTO XII,"As who should say, “My errand was for this.”"
16468,CANTO XII,O happy father! Felix rightly nam’d!
16469,CANTO XII,O favour’d mother! rightly nam’d Joanna!
16470,CANTO XII,"If that do mean, as men interpret it."
16471,CANTO XII,"Not for the world’s sake, for which now they pore"
16472,CANTO XII,"Upon Ostiense and Taddeo’s page,"
16473,CANTO XII,"But for the real manna, soon he grew"
16474,CANTO XII,"Mighty in learning, and did set himself"
16475,CANTO XII,"To go about the vineyard, that soon turns"
16476,CANTO XII,"To wan and wither’d, if not tended well:"
16477,CANTO XII,And from the see (whose bounty to the just
16478,CANTO XII,"And needy is gone by, not through its fault,"
16479,CANTO XII,"But his who fills it basely), he besought,"
16480,CANTO XII,"No dispensation for commuted wrong,"
16481,CANTO XII,"Nor the first vacant fortune, nor the tenth),"
16482,CANTO XII,"That to God’s paupers rightly appertain,"
16483,CANTO XII,"But, ’gainst an erring and degenerate world,"
16484,CANTO XII,"Licence to fight, in favour of that seed,"
16485,CANTO XII,From which the twice twelve cions gird thee round.
16486,CANTO XII,"Then, with sage doctrine and good will to help,"
16487,CANTO XII,"Forth on his great apostleship he far’d,"
16488,CANTO XII,Like torrent bursting from a lofty vein;
16489,CANTO XII,"And, dashing ’gainst the stocks of heresy,"
16490,CANTO XII,"Smote fiercest, where resistance was most stout."
16491,CANTO XII,"Thence many rivulets have since been turn’d,"
16492,CANTO XII,Over the garden Catholic to lead
16493,CANTO XII,"Their living waters, and have fed its plants."
16494,CANTO XII,
16495,CANTO XII,"“If such one wheel of that two-yoked car,"
16496,CANTO XII,"Wherein the holy church defended her,"
16497,CANTO XII,And rode triumphant through the civil broil.
16498,CANTO XII,"Thou canst not doubt its fellow’s excellence,"
16499,CANTO XII,"Which Thomas, ere my coming, hath declar’d"
16500,CANTO XII,"So courteously unto thee. But the track,"
16501,CANTO XII,"Which its smooth fellies made, is now deserted:"
16502,CANTO XII,That mouldy mother is where late were lees.
16503,CANTO XII,"His family, that wont to trace his path,"
16504,CANTO XII,"Turn backward, and invert their steps; erelong"
16505,CANTO XII,"To rue the gathering in of their ill crop,"
16506,CANTO XII,When the rejected tares in vain shall ask
16507,CANTO XII,Admittance to the barn. I question not
16508,CANTO XII,"But he, who search’d our volume, leaf by leaf,"
16509,CANTO XII,"Might still find page with this inscription on’t,"
16510,CANTO XII,‘I am as I was wont.’ Yet such were not
16511,CANTO XII,"From Acquasparta nor Casale, whence"
16512,CANTO XII,"Of those, who come to meddle with the text,"
16513,CANTO XII,One stretches and another cramps its rule.
16514,CANTO XII,"Bonaventura’s life in me behold,"
16515,CANTO XII,"From Bagnororegio, one, who in discharge"
16516,CANTO XII,Of my great offices still laid aside
16517,CANTO XII,"All sinister aim. Illuminato here,"
16518,CANTO XII,"And Agostino join me: two they were,"
16519,CANTO XII,"Among the first of those barefooted meek ones,"
16520,CANTO XII,Who sought God’s friendship in the cord: with them
16521,CANTO XII,"Hugues of Saint Victor, Pietro Mangiadore,"
16522,CANTO XII,"And he of Spain in his twelve volumes shining,"
16523,CANTO XII,"Nathan the prophet, Metropolitan"
16524,CANTO XII,"Chrysostom, and Anselmo, and, who deign’d"
16525,CANTO XII,"To put his hand to the first art, Donatus."
16526,CANTO XII,Raban is here: and at my side there shines
16527,CANTO XII,"Calabria’s abbot, Joachim , endow’d"
16528,CANTO XII,With soul prophetic. The bright courtesy
16529,CANTO XII,"Of friar Thomas, and his goodly lore,"
16530,CANTO XII,Have mov’d me to the blazon of a peer
16531,CANTO XII,"So worthy, and with me have mov’d this throng.”"
16532,CANTO XII,
16533,CANTO XII,

16536,CANTO XIII,CANTO XIII
16537,CANTO XIII,
16538,CANTO XIII,
16539,CANTO XIII,"Let him, who would conceive what now I saw,"
16540,CANTO XIII,"Imagine (and retain the image firm,"
16541,CANTO XIII,"As mountain rock, the whilst he hears me speak),"
16542,CANTO XIII,"Of stars fifteen, from midst the ethereal host"
16543,CANTO XIII,"Selected, that, with lively ray serene,"
16544,CANTO XIII,O’ercome the massiest air: thereto imagine
16545,CANTO XIII,"The wain, that, in the bosom of our sky,"
16546,CANTO XIII,"Spins ever on its axle night and day,"
16547,CANTO XIII,With the bright summit of that horn which swells
16548,CANTO XIII,"Due from the pole, round which the first wheel rolls,"
16549,CANTO XIII,T’ have rang’d themselves in fashion of two signs
16550,CANTO XIII,"In heav’n, such as Ariadne made,"
16551,CANTO XIII,When death’s chill seized her; and that one of them
16552,CANTO XIII,Did compass in the other’s beam; and both
16553,CANTO XIII,"In such sort whirl around, that each should tend"
16554,CANTO XIII,"With opposite motion and, conceiving thus,"
16555,CANTO XIII,"Of that true constellation, and the dance"
16556,CANTO XIII,"Twofold, that circled me, he shall attain"
16557,CANTO XIII,As ’twere the shadow; for things there as much
16558,CANTO XIII,"Surpass our usage, as the swiftest heav’n"
16559,CANTO XIII,Is swifter than the Chiana. There was sung
16560,CANTO XIII,"No Bacchus, and no Io Paean, but"
16561,CANTO XIII,"Three Persons in the Godhead, and in one"
16562,CANTO XIII,Substance that nature and the human join’d.
16563,CANTO XIII,
16564,CANTO XIII,The song fulfill’d its measure; and to us
16565,CANTO XIII,"Those saintly lights attended, happier made"
16566,CANTO XIII,"At each new minist’ring. Then silence brake,"
16567,CANTO XIII,"Amid th’ accordant sons of Deity,"
16568,CANTO XIII,"That luminary, in which the wondrous life"
16569,CANTO XIII,Of the meek man of God was told to me;
16570,CANTO XIII,"And thus it spake: “One ear o’ th’ harvest thresh’d,"
16571,CANTO XIII,"And its grain safely stor’d, sweet charity"
16572,CANTO XIII,Invites me with the other to like toil.
16573,CANTO XIII,
16574,CANTO XIII,"“Thou know’st, that in the bosom, whence the rib"
16575,CANTO XIII,"Was ta’en to fashion that fair cheek, whose taste"
16576,CANTO XIII,"All the world pays for, and in that, which pierc’d"
16577,CANTO XIII,"By the keen lance, both after and before"
16578,CANTO XIII,"Such satisfaction offer’d, as outweighs"
16579,CANTO XIII,"Each evil in the scale, whate’er of light"
16580,CANTO XIII,"To human nature is allow’d, must all"
16581,CANTO XIII,"Have by his virtue been infus’d, who form’d"
16582,CANTO XIII,Both one and other: and thou thence admir’st
16583,CANTO XIII,"In that I told thee, of beatitudes"
16584,CANTO XIII,"A second, there is none, to his enclos’d"
16585,CANTO XIII,In the fifth radiance. Open now thine eyes
16586,CANTO XIII,To what I answer thee; and thou shalt see
16587,CANTO XIII,"Thy deeming and my saying meet in truth,"
16588,CANTO XIII,"As centre in the round. That which dies not,"
16589,CANTO XIII,"And that which can die, are but each the beam"
16590,CANTO XIII,"Of that idea, which our Soverign Sire"
16591,CANTO XIII,"Engendereth loving; for that lively light,"
16592,CANTO XIII,Which passeth from his brightness; not disjoin’d
16593,CANTO XIII,"From him, nor from his love triune with them,"
16594,CANTO XIII,"Doth, through his bounty, congregate itself,"
16595,CANTO XIII,"Mirror’d, as ’twere in new existences,"
16596,CANTO XIII,Itself unalterable and ever one.
16597,CANTO XIII,
16598,CANTO XIII,"“Descending hence unto the lowest powers,"
16599,CANTO XIII,"Its energy so sinks, at last it makes"
16600,CANTO XIII,But brief contingencies: for so I name
16601,CANTO XIII,"Things generated, which the heav’nly orbs"
16602,CANTO XIII,"Moving, with seed or without seed, produce."
16603,CANTO XIII,"Their wax, and that which molds it, differ much:"
16604,CANTO XIII,"And thence with lustre, more or less, it shows"
16605,CANTO XIII,Th’ ideal stamp impress: so that one tree
16606,CANTO XIII,"According to his kind, hath better fruit,"
16607,CANTO XIII,"And worse: and, at your birth, ye, mortal men,"
16608,CANTO XIII,Are in your talents various. Were the wax
16609,CANTO XIII,"Molded with nice exactness, and the heav’n"
16610,CANTO XIII,"In its disposing influence supreme,"
16611,CANTO XIII,The lustre of the seal should be complete:
16612,CANTO XIII,"But nature renders it imperfect ever,"
16613,CANTO XIII,"Resembling thus the artist in her work,"
16614,CANTO XIII,Whose faultering hand is faithless to his skill.
16615,CANTO XIII,"Howe’er, if love itself dispose, and mark"
16616,CANTO XIII,"The primal virtue, kindling with bright view,"
16617,CANTO XIII,There all perfection is vouchsafed; and such
16618,CANTO XIII,"The clay was made, accomplish’d with each gift,"
16619,CANTO XIII,That life can teem with; such the burden fill’d
16620,CANTO XIII,The virgin’s bosom: so that I commend
16621,CANTO XIII,"Thy judgment, that the human nature ne’er"
16622,CANTO XIII,"Was or can be, such as in them it was."
16623,CANTO XIII,
16624,CANTO XIII,"“Did I advance no further than this point,"
16625,CANTO XIII,‘How then had he no peer?’ thou might’st reply.
16626,CANTO XIII,"But, that what now appears not, may appear"
16627,CANTO XIII,"Right plainly, ponder, who he was, and what"
16628,CANTO XIII,"(When he was bidden ‘Ask’), the motive sway’d"
16629,CANTO XIII,"To his requesting. I have spoken thus,"
16630,CANTO XIII,"That thou mayst see, he was a king, who ask’d"
16631,CANTO XIII,"For wisdom, to the end he might be king"
16632,CANTO XIII,Sufficient: not the number to search out
16633,CANTO XIII,"Of the celestial movers; or to know,"
16634,CANTO XIII,If necessary with contingent e’er
16635,CANTO XIII,Have made necessity; or whether that
16636,CANTO XIII,"Be granted, that first motion is; or if"
16637,CANTO XIII,"Of the mid circle can, by art, be made"
16638,CANTO XIII,"Triangle with each corner, blunt or sharp."
16639,CANTO XIII,
16640,CANTO XIII,"“Whence, noting that, which I have said, and this,"
16641,CANTO XIII,"Thou kingly prudence and that ken mayst learn,"
16642,CANTO XIII,At which the dart of my intention aims.
16643,CANTO XIII,"And, marking clearly, that I told thee, ‘Risen,’"
16644,CANTO XIII,Thou shalt discern it only hath respect
16645,CANTO XIII,"To kings, of whom are many, and the good"
16646,CANTO XIII,Are rare. With this distinction take my words;
16647,CANTO XIII,And they may well consist with that which thou
16648,CANTO XIII,"Of the first human father dost believe,"
16649,CANTO XIII,And of our well-beloved. And let this
16650,CANTO XIII,"Henceforth be led unto thy feet, to make"
16651,CANTO XIII,"Thee slow in motion, as a weary man,"
16652,CANTO XIII,Both to the ‘yea’ and to the ‘nay’ thou seest not.
16653,CANTO XIII,"For he among the fools is down full low,"
16654,CANTO XIII,"Whose affirmation, or denial, is"
16655,CANTO XIII,"Without distinction, in each case alike"
16656,CANTO XIII,"Since it befalls, that in most instances"
16657,CANTO XIII,Current opinion leads to false: and then
16658,CANTO XIII,Affection bends the judgment to her ply.
16659,CANTO XIII,
16660,CANTO XIII,"“Much more than vainly doth he loose from shore,"
16661,CANTO XIII,"Since he returns not such as he set forth,"
16662,CANTO XIII,Who fishes for the truth and wanteth skill.
16663,CANTO XIII,And open proofs of this unto the world
16664,CANTO XIII,"Have been afforded in Parmenides,"
16665,CANTO XIII,"Melissus, Bryso, and the crowd beside,"
16666,CANTO XIII,"Who journey’d on, and knew not whither: so did"
16667,CANTO XIII,"Sabellius, Arius, and the other fools,"
16668,CANTO XIII,"Who, like to scymitars, reflected back"
16669,CANTO XIII,"The scripture-image, by distortion marr’d."
16670,CANTO XIII,
16671,CANTO XIII,"“Let not the people be too swift to judge,"
16672,CANTO XIII,"As one who reckons on the blades in field,"
16673,CANTO XIII,Or ere the crop be ripe. For I have seen
16674,CANTO XIII,The thorn frown rudely all the winter long
16675,CANTO XIII,And after bear the rose upon its top;
16676,CANTO XIII,"And bark, that all the way across the sea"
16677,CANTO XIII,"Ran straight and speedy, perish at the last,"
16678,CANTO XIII,"E’en in the haven’s mouth seeing one steal,"
16679,CANTO XIII,"Another brine, his offering to the priest,"
16680,CANTO XIII,Let not Dame Birtha and Sir Martin thence
16681,CANTO XIII,Into heav’n’s counsels deem that they can pry:
16682,CANTO XIII,"For one of these may rise, the other fall.”"
16683,CANTO XIII,
16684,CANTO XIII,
16685,CANTO XIII,
16686,CANTO XIII,
16687,CANTO XIV,CANTO XIV
16688,CANTO XIV,
16689,CANTO XIV,
16690,CANTO XIV,"From centre to the circle, and so back"
16691,CANTO XIV,"From circle to the centre, water moves"
16692,CANTO XIV,"In the round chalice, even as the blow"
16693,CANTO XIV,"Impels it, inwardly, or from without."
16694,CANTO XIV,"Such was the image glanc’d into my mind,"
16695,CANTO XIV,As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas’d;
16696,CANTO XIV,And Beatrice after him her words
16697,CANTO XIV,Resum’d alternate: “Need there is (tho’ yet
16698,CANTO XIV,"He tells it to you not in words, nor e’en"
16699,CANTO XIV,In thought) that he should fathom to its depth
16700,CANTO XIV,"Another mystery. Tell him, if the light,"
16701,CANTO XIV,"Wherewith your substance blooms, shall stay with you"
16702,CANTO XIV,"Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,"
16703,CANTO XIV,"How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,"
16704,CANTO XIV,"The sight may without harm endure the change,"
16705,CANTO XIV,"That also tell.” As those, who in a ring"
16706,CANTO XIV,"Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth"
16707,CANTO XIV,"Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;"
16708,CANTO XIV,"Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,"
16709,CANTO XIV,The saintly circles in their tourneying
16710,CANTO XIV,And wond’rous note attested new delight.
16711,CANTO XIV,
16712,CANTO XIV,"Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb"
16713,CANTO XIV,"Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live"
16714,CANTO XIV,"Immortally above, he hath not seen"
16715,CANTO XIV,"The sweet refreshing, of that heav’nly shower."
16716,CANTO XIV,
16717,CANTO XIV,"Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns"
16718,CANTO XIV,"In mystic union of the Three in One,"
16719,CANTO XIV,"Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice"
16720,CANTO XIV,"Sang, with such melody, as but to hear"
16721,CANTO XIV,For highest merit were an ample meed.
16722,CANTO XIV,"And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,"
16723,CANTO XIV,"With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps"
16724,CANTO XIV,"The angel’s once to Mary, thus replied:"
16725,CANTO XIV,"“Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,"
16726,CANTO XIV,"Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,"
16727,CANTO XIV,"As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;"
16728,CANTO XIV,"And that as far in blessedness exceeding,"
16729,CANTO XIV,As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.
16730,CANTO XIV,"Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds"
16731,CANTO XIV,"Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,"
16732,CANTO XIV,"Show yet more gracious. Therefore shall increase,"
16733,CANTO XIV,"Whate’er of light, gratuitous, imparts"
16734,CANTO XIV,"The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,"
16735,CANTO XIV,The better disclose his glory: whence
16736,CANTO XIV,"The vision needs increasing, much increase"
16737,CANTO XIV,"The fervour, which it kindles; and that too"
16738,CANTO XIV,"The ray, that comes from it. But as the greed"
16739,CANTO XIV,"Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines"
16740,CANTO XIV,"More lively than that, and so preserves"
16741,CANTO XIV,Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere
16742,CANTO XIV,"Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,"
16743,CANTO XIV,"Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth"
16744,CANTO XIV,Now covers. Nor will such excess of light
16745,CANTO XIV,"O’erpower us, in corporeal organs made"
16746,CANTO XIV,"Firm, and susceptible of all delight.”"
16747,CANTO XIV,
16748,CANTO XIV,"So ready and so cordial an “Amen,”"
16749,CANTO XIV,"Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke"
16750,CANTO XIV,Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance
16751,CANTO XIV,"Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,"
16752,CANTO XIV,"Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov’d,"
16753,CANTO XIV,Ere they were made imperishable flame.
16754,CANTO XIV,
16755,CANTO XIV,And lo! forthwith there rose up round about
16756,CANTO XIV,"A lustre over that already there,"
16757,CANTO XIV,"Of equal clearness, like the brightening up"
16758,CANTO XIV,Of the horizon. As at an evening hour
16759,CANTO XIV,"Of twilight, new appearances through heav’n"
16760,CANTO XIV,"Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;"
16761,CANTO XIV,"So there new substances, methought began"
16762,CANTO XIV,To rise in view; and round the other twain
16763,CANTO XIV,"Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide."
16764,CANTO XIV,
16765,CANTO XIV,O gentle glitter of eternal beam!
16766,CANTO XIV,"With what a such whiteness did it flow,"
16767,CANTO XIV,"O’erpowering vision in me! But so fair,"
16768,CANTO XIV,"So passing lovely, Beatrice show’d,"
16769,CANTO XIV,"Mind cannot follow it, nor words express"
16770,CANTO XIV,Her infinite sweetness. Thence mine eyes regain’d
16771,CANTO XIV,"Power to look up, and I beheld myself,"
16772,CANTO XIV,"Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss"
16773,CANTO XIV,"Translated: for the star, with warmer smile"
16774,CANTO XIV,"Impurpled, well denoted our ascent."
16775,CANTO XIV,
16776,CANTO XIV,"With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks"
16777,CANTO XIV,"The same in all, an holocaust I made"
16778,CANTO XIV,"To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf’d."
16779,CANTO XIV,And from my bosom had not yet upsteam’d
16780,CANTO XIV,"The fuming of that incense, when I knew"
16781,CANTO XIV,The rite accepted. With such mighty sheen
16782,CANTO XIV,"And mantling crimson, in two listed rays"
16783,CANTO XIV,"The splendours shot before me, that I cried,"
16784,CANTO XIV,“God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!”
16785,CANTO XIV,
16786,CANTO XIV,"As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,"
16787,CANTO XIV,"Distinguish’d into greater lights and less,"
16788,CANTO XIV,"Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;"
16789,CANTO XIV,"So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,"
16790,CANTO XIV,"Those rays describ’d the venerable sign,"
16791,CANTO XIV,That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.
16792,CANTO XIV,Here memory mocks the toil of genius. Christ
16793,CANTO XIV,Beam’d on that cross; and pattern fails me now.
16794,CANTO XIV,"But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ"
16795,CANTO XIV,"Will pardon me for that I leave untold,"
16796,CANTO XIV,When in the flecker’d dawning he shall spy
16797,CANTO XIV,"The glitterance of Christ. From horn to horn,"
16798,CANTO XIV,And ’tween the summit and the base did move
16799,CANTO XIV,"Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass’d."
16800,CANTO XIV,"Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,"
16801,CANTO XIV,"Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,"
16802,CANTO XIV,"The atomies of bodies, long or short,"
16803,CANTO XIV,"To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line"
16804,CANTO XIV,"Checkers the shadow, interpos’d by art"
16805,CANTO XIV,Against the noontide heat. And as the chime
16806,CANTO XIV,"Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help"
16807,CANTO XIV,"With many strings, a pleasant dining makes"
16808,CANTO XIV,"To him, who heareth not distinct the note;"
16809,CANTO XIV,"So from the lights, which there appear’d to me,"
16810,CANTO XIV,"Gather’d along the cross a melody,"
16811,CANTO XIV,"That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment"
16812,CANTO XIV,Possess’d me. Yet I mark’d it was a hymn
16813,CANTO XIV,Of lofty praises; for there came to me
16814,CANTO XIV,"“Arise and conquer,” as to one who hears"
16815,CANTO XIV,And comprehends not. Me such ecstasy
16816,CANTO XIV,"O’ercame, that never till that hour was thing"
16817,CANTO XIV,That held me in so sweet imprisonment.
16818,CANTO XIV,
16819,CANTO XIV,"Perhaps my saying over bold appears,"
16820,CANTO XIV,"Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,"
16821,CANTO XIV,Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.
16822,CANTO XIV,"But he, who is aware those living seals"
16823,CANTO XIV,"Of every beauty work with quicker force,"
16824,CANTO XIV,The higher they are ris’n; and that there
16825,CANTO XIV,I had not turn’d me to them; he may well
16826,CANTO XIV,"Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse"
16827,CANTO XIV,"I do accuse me, and may own my truth;"
16828,CANTO XIV,"That holy pleasure here not yet reveal’d,"
16829,CANTO XIV,Which grows in transport as we mount aloof.
16830,CANTO XIV,
16831,CANTO XIV,
16832,CANTO XIV,
16833,CANTO XIV,
16834,CANTO XV,CANTO XV
16835,CANTO XV,
16836,CANTO XV,
16837,CANTO XV,"True love, that ever shows itself as clear"
16838,CANTO XV,"In kindness, as loose appetite in wrong,"
16839,CANTO XV,"Silenced that lyre harmonious, and still’d"
16840,CANTO XV,"The sacred chords, that are by heav’n’s right hand"
16841,CANTO XV,"Unwound and tighten’d, flow to righteous prayers"
16842,CANTO XV,"Should they not hearken, who, to give me will"
16843,CANTO XV,"For praying, in accordance thus were mute?"
16844,CANTO XV,"He hath in sooth good cause for endless grief,"
16845,CANTO XV,"Who, for the love of thing that lasteth not,"
16846,CANTO XV,Despoils himself forever of that love.
16847,CANTO XV,
16848,CANTO XV,"As oft along the still and pure serene,"
16849,CANTO XV,"At nightfall, glides a sudden trail of fire,"
16850,CANTO XV,Attracting with involuntary heed
16851,CANTO XV,"The eye to follow it, erewhile at rest,"
16852,CANTO XV,"And seems some star that shifted place in heav’n,"
16853,CANTO XV,"Only that, whence it kindles, none is lost,"
16854,CANTO XV,"And it is soon extinct; thus from the horn,"
16855,CANTO XV,"That on the dexter of the cross extends,"
16856,CANTO XV,"Down to its foot, one luminary ran"
16857,CANTO XV,From mid the cluster shone there; yet no gem
16858,CANTO XV,Dropp’d from its foil; and through the beamy list
16859,CANTO XV,"Like flame in alabaster, glow’d its course."
16860,CANTO XV,
16861,CANTO XV,So forward stretch’d him (if of credence aught
16862,CANTO XV,Our greater muse may claim) the pious ghost
16863,CANTO XV,"Of old Anchises, in the’ Elysian bower,"
16864,CANTO XV,"When he perceiv’d his son. “O thou, my blood!"
16865,CANTO XV,"O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,"
16866,CANTO XV,"As now to thee, hath twice the heav’nly gate"
16867,CANTO XV,Been e’er unclos’d?” so spake the light; whence I
16868,CANTO XV,Turn’d me toward him; then unto my dame
16869,CANTO XV,"My sight directed, and on either side"
16870,CANTO XV,Amazement waited me; for in her eyes
16871,CANTO XV,"Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine"
16872,CANTO XV,Had div’d unto the bottom of my grace
16873,CANTO XV,And of my bliss in Paradise. Forthwith
16874,CANTO XV,"To hearing and to sight grateful alike,"
16875,CANTO XV,The spirit to his proem added things
16876,CANTO XV,"I understood not, so profound he spake;"
16877,CANTO XV,Yet not of choice but through necessity
16878,CANTO XV,Mysterious; for his high conception scar’d
16879,CANTO XV,Beyond the mark of mortals. When the flight
16880,CANTO XV,"Of holy transport had so spent its rage,"
16881,CANTO XV,That nearer to the level of our thought
16882,CANTO XV,"The speech descended, the first sounds I heard"
16883,CANTO XV,"Were, “Best he thou, Triunal Deity!"
16884,CANTO XV,That hast such favour in my seed vouchsaf’d!”
16885,CANTO XV,"Then follow’d: “No unpleasant thirst, tho’ long,"
16886,CANTO XV,"Which took me reading in the sacred book,"
16887,CANTO XV,"Whose leaves or white or dusky never change,"
16888,CANTO XV,"Thou hast allay’d, my son, within this light,"
16889,CANTO XV,From whence my voice thou hear’st; more thanks to her.
16890,CANTO XV,Who for such lofty mounting has with plumes
16891,CANTO XV,Begirt thee. Thou dost deem thy thoughts to me
16892,CANTO XV,"From him transmitted, who is first of all,"
16893,CANTO XV,E’en as all numbers ray from unity;
16894,CANTO XV,"And therefore dost not ask me who I am,"
16895,CANTO XV,"Or why to thee more joyous I appear,"
16896,CANTO XV,Than any other in this gladsome throng.
16897,CANTO XV,The truth is as thou deem’st; for in this hue
16898,CANTO XV,"Both less and greater in that mirror look,"
16899,CANTO XV,"In which thy thoughts, or ere thou think’st, are shown."
16900,CANTO XV,"But, that the love, which keeps me wakeful ever,"
16901,CANTO XV,"Urging with sacred thirst of sweet desire,"
16902,CANTO XV,"May be contended fully, let thy voice,"
16903,CANTO XV,"Fearless, and frank and jocund, utter forth"
16904,CANTO XV,"Thy will distinctly, utter forth the wish,"
16905,CANTO XV,Whereto my ready answer stands decreed.”
16906,CANTO XV,
16907,CANTO XV,I turn’d me to Beatrice; and she heard
16908,CANTO XV,"Ere I had spoken, smiling, an assent,"
16909,CANTO XV,That to my will gave wings; and I began
16910,CANTO XV,"“To each among your tribe, what time ye kenn’d"
16911,CANTO XV,"The nature, in whom naught unequal dwells,"
16912,CANTO XV,Wisdom and love were in one measure dealt;
16913,CANTO XV,"For that they are so equal in the sun,"
16914,CANTO XV,"From whence ye drew your radiance and your heat,"
16915,CANTO XV,"As makes all likeness scant. But will and means,"
16916,CANTO XV,"In mortals, for the cause ye well discern,"
16917,CANTO XV,With unlike wings are fledge. A mortal I
16918,CANTO XV,"Experience inequality like this,"
16919,CANTO XV,"And therefore give no thanks, but in the heart,"
16920,CANTO XV,For thy paternal greeting. This howe’er
16921,CANTO XV,"I pray thee, living topaz! that ingemm’st"
16922,CANTO XV,"This precious jewel, let me hear thy name.”"
16923,CANTO XV,
16924,CANTO XV,"“I am thy root, O leaf! whom to expect"
16925,CANTO XV,"Even, hath pleas’d me: “thus the prompt reply"
16926,CANTO XV,"Prefacing, next it added; “he, of whom"
16927,CANTO XV,"Thy kindred appellation comes, and who,"
16928,CANTO XV,"These hundred years and more, on its first ledge"
16929,CANTO XV,"Hath circuited the mountain, was my son"
16930,CANTO XV,"And thy great grandsire. Well befits, his long"
16931,CANTO XV,Endurance should he shorten’d by thy deeds.
16932,CANTO XV,
16933,CANTO XV,"“Florence, within her ancient limit-mark,"
16934,CANTO XV,"Which calls her still to matin prayers and noon,"
16935,CANTO XV,"Was chaste and sober, and abode in peace."
16936,CANTO XV,"She had no armlets and no head-tires then,"
16937,CANTO XV,"No purfled dames, no zone, that caught the eye"
16938,CANTO XV,"More than the person did. Time was not yet,"
16939,CANTO XV,When at his daughter’s birth the sire grew pale.
16940,CANTO XV,For fear the age and dowry should exceed
16941,CANTO XV,On each side just proportion. House was none
16942,CANTO XV,Void of its family; nor yet had come
16943,CANTO XV,"Hardanapalus, to exhibit feats"
16944,CANTO XV,Of chamber prowess. Montemalo yet
16945,CANTO XV,O’er our suburban turret rose; as much
16946,CANTO XV,"To be surpass in fall, as in its rising."
16947,CANTO XV,I saw Bellincione Berti walk abroad
16948,CANTO XV,In leathern girdle and a clasp of bone;
16949,CANTO XV,"And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,"
16950,CANTO XV,His lady leave the glass. The sons I saw
16951,CANTO XV,Of Nerli and of Vecchio well content
16952,CANTO XV,With unrob’d jerkin; and their good dames handling
16953,CANTO XV,The spindle and the flax; O happy they!
16954,CANTO XV,"Each sure of burial in her native land,"
16955,CANTO XV,And none left desolate a-bed for France!
16956,CANTO XV,"One wak’d to tend the cradle, hushing it"
16957,CANTO XV,With sounds that lull’d the parent’s infancy:
16958,CANTO XV,"Another, with her maidens, drawing off"
16959,CANTO XV,"The tresses from the distaff, lectur’d them"
16960,CANTO XV,Old tales of Troy and Fesole and Rome.
16961,CANTO XV,A Salterello and Cianghella we
16962,CANTO XV,"Had held as strange a marvel, as ye would"
16963,CANTO XV,A Cincinnatus or Cornelia now.
16964,CANTO XV,
16965,CANTO XV,"“In such compos’d and seemly fellowship,"
16966,CANTO XV,"Such faithful and such fair equality,"
16967,CANTO XV,"In so sweet household, Mary at my birth"
16968,CANTO XV,"Bestow’d me, call’d on with loud cries; and there"
16969,CANTO XV,"In your old baptistery, I was made"
16970,CANTO XV,Christian at once and Cacciaguida; as were
16971,CANTO XV,"My brethren, Eliseo and Moronto."
16972,CANTO XV,
16973,CANTO XV,"“From Valdipado came to me my spouse,"
16974,CANTO XV,And hence thy surname grew. I follow’d then
16975,CANTO XV,The Emperor Conrad; and his knighthood he
16976,CANTO XV,Did gird on me; in such good part he took
16977,CANTO XV,My valiant service. After him I went
16978,CANTO XV,"To testify against that evil law,"
16979,CANTO XV,"Whose people, by the shepherd’s fault, possess"
16980,CANTO XV,"Your right, usurping. There, by that foul crew"
16981,CANTO XV,"Was I releas’d from the deceitful world,"
16982,CANTO XV,"Whose base affection many a spirit soils,"
16983,CANTO XV,And from the martyrdom came to this peace.”
16984,CANTO XV,
16985,CANTO XV,
16986,CANTO XV,
16987,CANTO XV,
16988,CANTO XVI,CANTO XVI
16989,CANTO XVI,
16990,CANTO XVI,
16991,CANTO XVI,O slight respect of man’s nobility!
16992,CANTO XVI,"I never shall account it marvelous,"
16993,CANTO XVI,That our infirm affection here below
16994,CANTO XVI,"Thou mov’st to boasting, when I could not choose,"
16995,CANTO XVI,"E’en in that region of unwarp’d desire,"
16996,CANTO XVI,"In heav’n itself, but make my vaunt in thee!"
16997,CANTO XVI,"Yet cloak thou art soon shorten’d, for that time,"
16998,CANTO XVI,"Unless thou be eked out from day to day,"
16999,CANTO XVI,Goes round thee with his shears. Resuming then
17000,CANTO XVI,"With greeting such, as Rome, was first to bear,"
17001,CANTO XVI,But since hath disaccustom’d I began;
17002,CANTO XVI,"And Beatrice, that a little space"
17003,CANTO XVI,"Was sever’d, smil’d reminding me of her,"
17004,CANTO XVI,Whose cough embolden’d (as the story holds)
17005,CANTO XVI,To first offence the doubting Guenever.
17006,CANTO XVI,
17007,CANTO XVI,"“You are my sire,” said I, “you give me heart"
17008,CANTO XVI,Freely to speak my thought: above myself
17009,CANTO XVI,You raise me. Through so many streams with joy
17010,CANTO XVI,"My soul is fill’d, that gladness wells from it;"
17011,CANTO XVI,"So that it bears the mighty tide, and bursts not"
17012,CANTO XVI,"Say then, my honour’d stem! what ancestors"
17013,CANTO XVI,"Where those you sprang from, and what years were mark’d"
17014,CANTO XVI,"In your first childhood? Tell me of the fold,"
17015,CANTO XVI,"That hath Saint John for guardian, what was then"
17016,CANTO XVI,"Its state, and who in it were highest seated?”"
17017,CANTO XVI,
17018,CANTO XVI,"As embers, at the breathing of the wind,"
17019,CANTO XVI,"Their flame enliven, so that light I saw"
17020,CANTO XVI,"Shine at my blandishments; and, as it grew"
17021,CANTO XVI,"More fair to look on, so with voice more sweet,"
17022,CANTO XVI,"Yet not in this our modern phrase, forthwith"
17023,CANTO XVI,"It answer’d: “From the day, when it was said"
17024,CANTO XVI,"‘Hail Virgin!’ to the throes, by which my mother,"
17025,CANTO XVI,"Who now is sainted, lighten’d her of me"
17026,CANTO XVI,"Whom she was heavy with, this fire had come,"
17027,CANTO XVI,"Five hundred fifty times and thrice, its beams"
17028,CANTO XVI,To reilumine underneath the foot
17029,CANTO XVI,"Of its own lion. They, of whom I sprang,"
17030,CANTO XVI,"And I, had there our birth-place, where the last"
17031,CANTO XVI,Partition of our city first is reach’d
17032,CANTO XVI,"By him, that runs her annual game. Thus much"
17033,CANTO XVI,"Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,"
17034,CANTO XVI,"And whence they hither came, more honourable"
17035,CANTO XVI,It is to pass in silence than to tell.
17036,CANTO XVI,"All those, who in that time were there from Mars"
17037,CANTO XVI,"Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,"
17038,CANTO XVI,Were but the fifth of them this day alive.
17039,CANTO XVI,"But then the citizen’s blood, that now is mix’d"
17040,CANTO XVI,"From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,"
17041,CANTO XVI,Ran purely through the last mechanic’s veins.
17042,CANTO XVI,"O how much better were it, that these people"
17043,CANTO XVI,"Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo"
17044,CANTO XVI,"And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound’ry,"
17045,CANTO XVI,"Than to have them within, and bear the stench"
17046,CANTO XVI,"Of Aguglione’s hind, and Signa’s, him,"
17047,CANTO XVI,That hath his eye already keen for bart’ring!
17048,CANTO XVI,"Had not the people, which of all the world"
17049,CANTO XVI,"Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,"
17050,CANTO XVI,"But, as a mother, gracious to her son;"
17051,CANTO XVI,"Such one, as hath become a Florentine,"
17052,CANTO XVI,"And trades and traffics, had been turn’d adrift"
17053,CANTO XVI,"To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply’d"
17054,CANTO XVI,The beggar’s craft. The Conti were possess’d
17055,CANTO XVI,Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still
17056,CANTO XVI,Were in Acone’s parish; nor had haply
17057,CANTO XVI,From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.
17058,CANTO XVI,The city’s malady hath ever source
17059,CANTO XVI,"In the confusion of its persons, as"
17060,CANTO XVI,"The body’s, in variety of food:"
17061,CANTO XVI,"And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,"
17062,CANTO XVI,Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword
17063,CANTO XVI,"Doth more and better execution,"
17064,CANTO XVI,"Than five. Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,"
17065,CANTO XVI,"How they are gone, and after them how go"
17066,CANTO XVI,Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and ’twill seem
17067,CANTO XVI,"No longer new or strange to thee to hear,"
17068,CANTO XVI,"That families fail, when cities have their end."
17069,CANTO XVI,"All things, that appertain t’ ye, like yourselves,"
17070,CANTO XVI,Are mortal: but mortality in some
17071,CANTO XVI,"Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you"
17072,CANTO XVI,Pass by so suddenly. And as the moon
17073,CANTO XVI,"Doth, by the rolling of her heav’nly sphere,"
17074,CANTO XVI,Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;
17075,CANTO XVI,So fortune deals with Florence. Hence admire not
17076,CANTO XVI,"At what of them I tell thee, whose renown"
17077,CANTO XVI,"Time covers, the first Florentines. I saw"
17078,CANTO XVI,"The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,"
17079,CANTO XVI,"The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,"
17080,CANTO XVI,"Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:"
17081,CANTO XVI,"And great as ancient, of Sannella him,"
17082,CANTO XVI,"With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri"
17083,CANTO XVI,"And Ardinghi, and Bostichi. At the poop,"
17084,CANTO XVI,"That now is laden with new felony,"
17085,CANTO XVI,"So cumb’rous it may speedily sink the bark,"
17086,CANTO XVI,"The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung"
17087,CANTO XVI,"The County Guido, and whoso hath since"
17088,CANTO XVI,His title from the fam’d Bellincione ta’en.
17089,CANTO XVI,Fair governance was yet an art well priz’d
17090,CANTO XVI,By him of Pressa: Galigaio show’d
17091,CANTO XVI,"The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house."
17092,CANTO XVI,"The column, cloth’d with verrey, still was seen"
17093,CANTO XVI,"Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,"
17094,CANTO XVI,"Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,"
17095,CANTO XVI,With them who blush to hear the bushel nam’d.
17096,CANTO XVI,Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk
17097,CANTO XVI,Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs
17098,CANTO XVI,Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.
17099,CANTO XVI,"How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride"
17100,CANTO XVI,Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds
17101,CANTO XVI,Florence was by the bullets of bright gold
17102,CANTO XVI,"O’erflourish’d. Such the sires of those, who now,"
17103,CANTO XVI,"As surely as your church is vacant, flock"
17104,CANTO XVI,"Into her consistory, and at leisure"
17105,CANTO XVI,"There stall them and grow fat. The o’erweening brood,"
17106,CANTO XVI,"That plays the dragon after him that flees,"
17107,CANTO XVI,"But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,"
17108,CANTO XVI,"Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,"
17109,CANTO XVI,"Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem’d,"
17110,CANTO XVI,That Ubertino of Donati grudg’d
17111,CANTO XVI,His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.
17112,CANTO XVI,Already Caponsacco had descended
17113,CANTO XVI,Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda
17114,CANTO XVI,And Infangato were good citizens.
17115,CANTO XVI,"A thing incredible I tell, tho’ true:"
17116,CANTO XVI,"The gateway, named from those of Pera, led"
17117,CANTO XVI,Into the narrow circuit of your walls.
17118,CANTO XVI,"Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings"
17119,CANTO XVI,Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth
17120,CANTO XVI,The festival of Thomas still revives)
17121,CANTO XVI,His knighthood and his privilege retain’d;
17122,CANTO XVI,"Albeit one, who borders them With gold,"
17123,CANTO XVI,This day is mingled with the common herd.
17124,CANTO XVI,"In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,"
17125,CANTO XVI,And Importuni: well for its repose
17126,CANTO XVI,Had it still lack’d of newer neighbourhood.
17127,CANTO XVI,"The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,"
17128,CANTO XVI,Through the just anger that hath murder’d ye
17129,CANTO XVI,"And put a period to your gladsome days,"
17130,CANTO XVI,"Was honour’d, it, and those consorted with it."
17131,CANTO XVI,O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling
17132,CANTO XVI,Prevail’d on thee to break the plighted bond
17133,CANTO XVI,"Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,"
17134,CANTO XVI,"Had God to Ema giv’n thee, the first time"
17135,CANTO XVI,Thou near our city cam’st. But so was doom’d:
17136,CANTO XVI,"On that maim’d stone set up to guard the bridge,"
17137,CANTO XVI,"At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell."
17138,CANTO XVI,"With these and others like to them, I saw"
17139,CANTO XVI,"Florence in such assur’d tranquility,"
17140,CANTO XVI,She had no cause at which to grieve: with these
17141,CANTO XVI,"Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne’er"
17142,CANTO XVI,"The lily from the lance had hung reverse,"
17143,CANTO XVI,Or through division been with vermeil dyed.”
17144,CANTO XVI,
17145,CANTO XVI,
17146,CANTO XVI,
17147,CANTO XVI,
17148,CANTO XVII,CANTO XVII
17149,CANTO XVII,
17150,CANTO XVII,
17151,CANTO XVII,"Such as the youth, who came to Clymene"
17152,CANTO XVII,"To certify himself of that reproach,"
17153,CANTO XVII,"Which had been fasten’d on him, (he whose end"
17154,CANTO XVII,"Still makes the fathers chary to their sons,"
17155,CANTO XVII,E’en such was I; nor unobserv’d was such
17156,CANTO XVII,"Of Beatrice, and that saintly lamp,"
17157,CANTO XVII,Who had erewhile for me his station mov’d;
17158,CANTO XVII,"When thus by lady: “Give thy wish free vent,"
17159,CANTO XVII,"That it may issue, bearing true report"
17160,CANTO XVII,Of the mind’s impress; not that aught thy words
17161,CANTO XVII,"May to our knowledge add, but to the end,"
17162,CANTO XVII,That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst
17163,CANTO XVII,And men may mingle for thee when they hear.”
17164,CANTO XVII,
17165,CANTO XVII,“O plant! from whence I spring! rever’d and lov’d!
17166,CANTO XVII,"Who soar’st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,"
17167,CANTO XVII,As earthly thought determines two obtuse
17168,CANTO XVII,"In one triangle not contain’d, so clear"
17169,CANTO XVII,"Dost see contingencies, ere in themselves"
17170,CANTO XVII,"Existent, looking at the point whereto"
17171,CANTO XVII,"All times are present, I, the whilst I scal’d"
17172,CANTO XVII,"With Virgil the soul purifying mount,"
17173,CANTO XVII,"And visited the nether world of woe,"
17174,CANTO XVII,Touching my future destiny have heard
17175,CANTO XVII,"Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides"
17176,CANTO XVII,Well squar’d to fortune’s blows. Therefore my will
17177,CANTO XVII,"Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,"
17178,CANTO XVII,"The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight.”"
17179,CANTO XVII,
17180,CANTO XVII,"So said I to the brightness, which erewhile"
17181,CANTO XVII,"To me had spoken, and my will declar’d,"
17182,CANTO XVII,"As Beatrice will’d, explicitly."
17183,CANTO XVII,"Nor with oracular response obscure,"
17184,CANTO XVII,"Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,"
17185,CANTO XVII,"Beguil’d the credulous nations; but, in terms"
17186,CANTO XVII,"Precise and unambiguous lore, replied"
17187,CANTO XVII,"The spirit of paternal love, enshrin’d,"
17188,CANTO XVII,Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:
17189,CANTO XVII,"“Contingency, unfolded not to view"
17190,CANTO XVII,"Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,"
17191,CANTO XVII,Is all depictur’d in the’ eternal sight;
17192,CANTO XVII,"But hence deriveth not necessity,"
17193,CANTO XVII,"More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,"
17194,CANTO XVII,"Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene."
17195,CANTO XVII,"From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony"
17196,CANTO XVII,"From organ comes, so comes before mine eye"
17197,CANTO XVII,The time prepar’d for thee. Such as driv’n out
17198,CANTO XVII,"From Athens, by his cruel stepdame’s wiles,"
17199,CANTO XVII,"Hippolytus departed, such must thou"
17200,CANTO XVII,"Depart from Florence. This they wish, and this"
17201,CANTO XVII,"Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,"
17202,CANTO XVII,"Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,"
17203,CANTO XVII,"Throughout the livelong day. The common cry,"
17204,CANTO XVII,"Will, as ’tis ever wont, affix the blame"
17205,CANTO XVII,Unto the party injur’d: but the truth
17206,CANTO XVII,"Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find"
17207,CANTO XVII,A faithful witness. Thou shall leave each thing
17208,CANTO XVII,Belov’d most dearly: this is the first shaft
17209,CANTO XVII,Shot from the bow of exile. Thou shalt prove
17210,CANTO XVII,"How salt the savour is of other’s bread,"
17211,CANTO XVII,How hard the passage to descend and climb
17212,CANTO XVII,"By other’s stairs, But that shall gall thee most"
17213,CANTO XVII,"Will he the worthless and vile company,"
17214,CANTO XVII,With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.
17215,CANTO XVII,"For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,"
17216,CANTO XVII,Shall turn ’gainst thee: but in a little while
17217,CANTO XVII,Theirs and not thine shall be the crimson’d brow
17218,CANTO XVII,Their course shall so evince their brutishness
17219,CANTO XVII,T’ have ta’en thy stand apart shall well become thee.
17220,CANTO XVII,
17221,CANTO XVII,"“First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,"
17222,CANTO XVII,"In the great Lombard’s courtesy, who bears"
17223,CANTO XVII,Upon the ladder perch’d the sacred bird.
17224,CANTO XVII,"He shall behold thee with such kind regard,"
17225,CANTO XVII,"That ’twixt ye two, the contrary to that"
17226,CANTO XVII,"Which falls ’twixt other men, the granting shall"
17227,CANTO XVII,Forerun the asking. With him shalt thou see
17228,CANTO XVII,"That mortal, who was at his birth impress"
17229,CANTO XVII,"So strongly from this star, that of his deeds"
17230,CANTO XVII,The nations shall take note. His unripe age
17231,CANTO XVII,Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels
17232,CANTO XVII,Only nine years have compass him about.
17233,CANTO XVII,"But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,"
17234,CANTO XVII,"Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,"
17235,CANTO XVII,In equal scorn of labours and of gold.
17236,CANTO XVII,"His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,"
17237,CANTO XVII,As not to let the tongues e’en of his foes
17238,CANTO XVII,Be idle in its praise. Look thou to him
17239,CANTO XVII,And his beneficence: for he shall cause
17240,CANTO XVII,"Reversal of their lot to many people,"
17241,CANTO XVII,Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.
17242,CANTO XVII,And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul
17243,CANTO XVII,"Of him, but tell it not; “and things he told"
17244,CANTO XVII,Incredible to those who witness them;
17245,CANTO XVII,"Then added: “So interpret thou, my son,"
17246,CANTO XVII,What hath been told thee.—Lo! the ambushment
17247,CANTO XVII,That a few circling seasons hide for thee!
17248,CANTO XVII,Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends
17249,CANTO XVII,Thy span beyond their treason’s chastisement.”
17250,CANTO XVII,
17251,CANTO XVII,"Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,"
17252,CANTO XVII,"Had shown the web, which I had streteh’d for him"
17253,CANTO XVII,"Upon the warp, was woven, I began,"
17254,CANTO XVII,"As one, who in perplexity desires"
17255,CANTO XVII,"Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:"
17256,CANTO XVII,“My father! well I mark how time spurs on
17257,CANTO XVII,"Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,"
17258,CANTO XVII,"Which falls most heavily on him, who most"
17259,CANTO XVII,Abandoned himself. Therefore ’tis good
17260,CANTO XVII,"I should forecast, that driven from the place"
17261,CANTO XVII,"Most dear to me, I may not lose myself"
17262,CANTO XVII,All others by my song. Down through the world
17263,CANTO XVII,"Of infinite mourning, and along the mount"
17264,CANTO XVII,"From whose fair height my lady’s eyes did lift me,"
17265,CANTO XVII,"And after through this heav’n from light to light,"
17266,CANTO XVII,"Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,"
17267,CANTO XVII,It may with many woefully disrelish;
17268,CANTO XVII,"And, if I am a timid friend to truth,"
17269,CANTO XVII,"I fear my life may perish among those,"
17270,CANTO XVII,To whom these days shall be of ancient date.”
17271,CANTO XVII,
17272,CANTO XVII,"The brightness, where enclos’d the treasure smil’d,"
17273,CANTO XVII,"Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,"
17274,CANTO XVII,Like to a golden mirror in the sun;
17275,CANTO XVII,"Next answer’d: “Conscience, dimm’d or by its own"
17276,CANTO XVII,"Or other’s shame, will feel thy saying sharp."
17277,CANTO XVII,"Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov’d,"
17278,CANTO XVII,See the whole vision be made manifest.
17279,CANTO XVII,And let them wince who have their withers wrung.
17280,CANTO XVII,"What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove"
17281,CANTO XVII,"Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn"
17282,CANTO XVII,"To vital nourishment. The cry thou raisest,"
17283,CANTO XVII,"Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;"
17284,CANTO XVII,"Which is of honour no light argument,"
17285,CANTO XVII,"For this there only have been shown to thee,"
17286,CANTO XVII,"Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,"
17287,CANTO XVII,"Spirits, whom fame hath note of. For the mind"
17288,CANTO XVII,"Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce"
17289,CANTO XVII,"And fix its faith, unless the instance brought"
17290,CANTO XVII,"Be palpable, and proof apparent urge.”"
17291,CANTO XVII,
17292,CANTO XVII,
17293,CANTO XVII,
17294,CANTO XVII,
17295,CANTO XVIII,CANTO XVIII
17296,CANTO XVIII,
17297,CANTO XVIII,
17298,CANTO XVIII,"Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy’d"
17299,CANTO XVIII,"That blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,"
17300,CANTO XVIII,"Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,"
17301,CANTO XVIII,"Who led me unto God, admonish’d: “Muse"
17302,CANTO XVIII,"On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him"
17303,CANTO XVIII,"I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong.”"
17304,CANTO XVIII,
17305,CANTO XVIII,At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn’d;
17306,CANTO XVIII,"And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,"
17307,CANTO XVIII,I leave in silence here: nor through distrust
17308,CANTO XVIII,"Of my words only, but that to such bliss"
17309,CANTO XVIII,The mind remounts not without aid. Thus much
17310,CANTO XVIII,"Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz’d on her,"
17311,CANTO XVIII,Affection found no room for other wish.
17312,CANTO XVIII,"While the everlasting pleasure, that did full"
17313,CANTO XVIII,"On Beatrice shine, with second view"
17314,CANTO XVIII,From her fair countenance my gladden’d soul
17315,CANTO XVIII,Contented; vanquishing me with a beam
17316,CANTO XVIII,"Of her soft smile, she spake: “Turn thee, and list."
17317,CANTO XVIII,These eyes are not thy only Paradise.”
17318,CANTO XVIII,
17319,CANTO XVIII,As here we sometimes in the looks may see
17320,CANTO XVIII,"Th’ affection mark’d, when that its sway hath ta’en"
17321,CANTO XVIII,"The spirit wholly; thus the hallow’d light,"
17322,CANTO XVIII,"To whom I turn’d, flashing, bewray’d its will"
17323,CANTO XVIII,"To talk yet further with me, and began:"
17324,CANTO XVIII,"“On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life"
17325,CANTO XVIII,"Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair"
17326,CANTO XVIII,"And leaf unwith’ring, blessed spirits abide,"
17327,CANTO XVIII,"That were below, ere they arriv’d in heav’n,"
17328,CANTO XVIII,"So mighty in renown, as every muse"
17329,CANTO XVIII,Might grace her triumph with them. On the horns
17330,CANTO XVIII,"Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,"
17331,CANTO XVIII,"Shall there enact, as doth 1n summer cloud"
17332,CANTO XVIII,"Its nimble fire.” Along the cross I saw,"
17333,CANTO XVIII,"At the repeated name of Joshua,"
17334,CANTO XVIII,"A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,"
17335,CANTO XVIII,"Ere it was done: then, at the naming saw"
17336,CANTO XVIII,"Of the great Maccabee, another move"
17337,CANTO XVIII,With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge
17338,CANTO XVIII,Unto that top. The next for Charlemagne
17339,CANTO XVIII,"And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze"
17340,CANTO XVIII,"Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues"
17341,CANTO XVIII,"A falcon flying. Last, along the cross,"
17342,CANTO XVIII,"William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew"
17343,CANTO XVIII,"My ken, and Robert Guiscard. And the soul,"
17344,CANTO XVIII,Who spake with me among the other lights
17345,CANTO XVIII,"Did move away, and mix; and with the choir"
17346,CANTO XVIII,Of heav’nly songsters prov’d his tuneful skill.
17347,CANTO XVIII,
17348,CANTO XVIII,"To Beatrice on my right l bent,"
17349,CANTO XVIII,Looking for intimation or by word
17350,CANTO XVIII,"Or act, what next behoov’d; and did descry"
17351,CANTO XVIII,"Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,"
17352,CANTO XVIII,"It past all former wont. And, as by sense"
17353,CANTO XVIII,"Of new delight, the man, who perseveres"
17354,CANTO XVIII,In good deeds doth perceive from day to day
17355,CANTO XVIII,His virtue growing; I e’en thus perceiv’d
17356,CANTO XVIII,"Of my ascent, together with the heav’n"
17357,CANTO XVIII,"The circuit widen’d, noting the increase"
17358,CANTO XVIII,Of beauty in that wonder. Like the change
17359,CANTO XVIII,"In a brief moment on some maiden’s cheek,"
17360,CANTO XVIII,Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight
17361,CANTO XVIII,"Of pudency, that stain’d it; such in her,"
17362,CANTO XVIII,"And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,"
17363,CANTO XVIII,"Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,"
17364,CANTO XVIII,"Whose sixth orb now enfolded us. I saw,"
17365,CANTO XVIII,"Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks"
17366,CANTO XVIII,"Of love, that reign’d there, fashion to my view"
17367,CANTO XVIII,"Our language. And as birds, from river banks"
17368,CANTO XVIII,"Arisen, now in round, now lengthen’d troop,"
17369,CANTO XVIII,"Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,"
17370,CANTO XVIII,"Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,"
17371,CANTO XVIII,"The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made"
17372,CANTO XVIII,Now D. now I. now L. figur’d I’ th’ air.
17373,CANTO XVIII,"First, singing, to their notes they mov’d, then one"
17374,CANTO XVIII,"Becoming of these signs, a little while"
17375,CANTO XVIII,"Did rest them, and were mute. O nymph divine"
17376,CANTO XVIII,"Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou"
17377,CANTO XVIII,"Inspir’st, mak’st glorious and long-liv’d, as they"
17378,CANTO XVIII,Cities and realms by thee! thou with thyself
17379,CANTO XVIII,"Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes,"
17380,CANTO XVIII,As fancy doth present them. Be thy power
17381,CANTO XVIII,"Display’d in this brief song. The characters,"
17382,CANTO XVIII,"Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven."
17383,CANTO XVIII,"In order each, as they appear’d, I mark’d."
17384,CANTO XVIII,"Diligite Justitiam, the first,"
17385,CANTO XVIII,Both verb and noun all blazon’d; and the extreme
17386,CANTO XVIII,Qui judicatis terram. In the M.
17387,CANTO XVIII,"Of the fifth word they held their station,"
17388,CANTO XVIII,Making the star seem silver streak’d with gold.
17389,CANTO XVIII,And on the summit of the M. I saw
17390,CANTO XVIII,"Descending other lights, that rested there,"
17391,CANTO XVIII,"Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good."
17392,CANTO XVIII,"Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,"
17393,CANTO XVIII,Sparkles innumerable on all sides
17394,CANTO XVIII,"Rise scatter’d, source of augury to th’ unwise;"
17395,CANTO XVIII,Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence
17396,CANTO XVIII,"Seem’d reascending, and a higher pitch"
17397,CANTO XVIII,"Some mounting, and some less; e’en as the sun,"
17398,CANTO XVIII,"Which kindleth them, decreed. And when each one"
17399,CANTO XVIII,"Had settled in his place, the head and neck"
17400,CANTO XVIII,"Then saw I of an eagle, lively"
17401,CANTO XVIII,"Grav’d in that streaky fire. Who painteth there,"
17402,CANTO XVIII,Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;
17403,CANTO XVIII,And every line and texture of the nest
17404,CANTO XVIII,"Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it."
17405,CANTO XVIII,"The other bright beatitude, that seem’d"
17406,CANTO XVIII,"Erewhile, with lilied crowning, well content"
17407,CANTO XVIII,"To over-canopy the M. mov’d forth,"
17408,CANTO XVIII,Following gently the impress of the bird.
17409,CANTO XVIII,
17410,CANTO XVIII,Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems
17411,CANTO XVIII,Declar’d to me our justice on the earth
17412,CANTO XVIII,"To be the effluence of that heav’n, which thou,"
17413,CANTO XVIII,"Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!"
17414,CANTO XVIII,"Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom"
17415,CANTO XVIII,"Thy motion and thy virtue are begun,"
17416,CANTO XVIII,"That he would look from whence the fog doth rise,"
17417,CANTO XVIII,To vitiate thy beam: so that once more
17418,CANTO XVIII,"He may put forth his hand ’gainst such, as drive"
17419,CANTO XVIII,"Their traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls"
17420,CANTO XVIII,With miracles and martyrdoms were built.
17421,CANTO XVIII,
17422,CANTO XVIII,Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey l
17423,CANTO XVIII,"O beg ye grace for those, that are on earth"
17424,CANTO XVIII,All after ill example gone astray.
17425,CANTO XVIII,War once had for its instrument the sword:
17426,CANTO XVIII,"But now ’tis made, taking the bread away"
17427,CANTO XVIII,"Which the good Father locks from none.—And thou,"
17428,CANTO XVIII,"That writes but to cancel, think, that they,"
17429,CANTO XVIII,"Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,"
17430,CANTO XVIII,"Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings."
17431,CANTO XVIII,"Thou hast good cause to cry, “My heart so cleaves"
17432,CANTO XVIII,"To him, that liv’d in solitude remote,"
17433,CANTO XVIII,"And from the wilds was dragg’d to martyrdom,"
17434,CANTO XVIII,I wist not of the fisherman nor Paul.”
17435,CANTO XVIII,
17436,CANTO XVIII,
17437,CANTO XVIII,
17438,CANTO XVIII,
17439,CANTO XIX,CANTO XIX
17440,CANTO XIX,
17441,CANTO XIX,
17442,CANTO XIX,"Before my sight appear’d, with open wings,"
17443,CANTO XIX,"The beauteous image, in fruition sweet"
17444,CANTO XIX,Gladdening the thronged spirits. Each did seem
17445,CANTO XIX,"A little ruby, whereon so intense"
17446,CANTO XIX,The sun-beam glow’d that to mine eyes it came
17447,CANTO XIX,"In clear refraction. And that, which next"
17448,CANTO XIX,"Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter’d,"
17449,CANTO XIX,"Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy"
17450,CANTO XIX,Was e’er conceiv’d. For I beheld and heard
17451,CANTO XIX,"The beak discourse; and, what intention form’d"
17452,CANTO XIX,"Of many, singly as of one express,"
17453,CANTO XIX,"Beginning: “For that I was just and piteous,"
17454,CANTO XIX,"l am exalted to this height of glory,"
17455,CANTO XIX,The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth
17456,CANTO XIX,"Have I my memory left, e’en by the bad"
17457,CANTO XIX,"Commended, while they leave its course untrod.”"
17458,CANTO XIX,
17459,CANTO XIX,"Thus is one heat from many embers felt,"
17460,CANTO XIX,"As in that image many were the loves,"
17461,CANTO XIX,"And one the voice, that issued from them all."
17462,CANTO XIX,Whence I address them: “O perennial flowers
17463,CANTO XIX,Of gladness everlasting! that exhale
17464,CANTO XIX,In single breath your odours manifold!
17465,CANTO XIX,"Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas’d,"
17466,CANTO XIX,"That with great craving long hath held my soul,"
17467,CANTO XIX,"Finding no food on earth. This well I know,"
17468,CANTO XIX,"That if there be in heav’n a realm, that shows"
17469,CANTO XIX,"In faithful mirror the celestial Justice,"
17470,CANTO XIX,Yours without veil reflects it. Ye discern
17471,CANTO XIX,"The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself"
17472,CANTO XIX,To hearken; ye the doubt that urges me
17473,CANTO XIX,"With such inveterate craving.” Straight I saw,"
17474,CANTO XIX,"Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,"
17475,CANTO XIX,"That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,"
17476,CANTO XIX,His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.
17477,CANTO XIX,"So saw I move that stately sign, with praise"
17478,CANTO XIX,Of grace divine inwoven and high song
17479,CANTO XIX,"Of inexpressive joy. “He,” it began,"
17480,CANTO XIX,"“Who turn’d his compass on the world’s extreme,"
17481,CANTO XIX,"And in that space so variously hath wrought,"
17482,CANTO XIX,"Both openly, and in secret, in such wise"
17483,CANTO XIX,Could not through all the universe display
17484,CANTO XIX,"Impression of his glory, that the Word"
17485,CANTO XIX,Of his omniscience should not still remain
17486,CANTO XIX,"In infinite excess. In proof whereof,"
17487,CANTO XIX,"He first through pride supplanted, who was sum"
17488,CANTO XIX,"Of each created being, waited not"
17489,CANTO XIX,"For light celestial, and abortive fell."
17490,CANTO XIX,Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant
17491,CANTO XIX,"Receptacle unto that Good, which knows"
17492,CANTO XIX,"No limit, measur’d by itself alone."
17493,CANTO XIX,"Therefore your sight, of th’ omnipresent Mind"
17494,CANTO XIX,"A single beam, its origin must own"
17495,CANTO XIX,Surpassing far its utmost potency.
17496,CANTO XIX,"The ken, your world is gifted with, descends"
17497,CANTO XIX,"In th’ everlasting Justice as low down,"
17498,CANTO XIX,As eye doth in the sea; which though it mark
17499,CANTO XIX,"The bottom from the shore, in the wide main"
17500,CANTO XIX,"Discerns it not; and ne’ertheless it is,"
17501,CANTO XIX,"But hidden through its deepness. Light is none,"
17502,CANTO XIX,Save that which cometh from the pure serene
17503,CANTO XIX,"Of ne’er disturbed ether: for the rest,"
17504,CANTO XIX,"’Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,"
17505,CANTO XIX,Or else its poison. Here confess reveal’d
17506,CANTO XIX,"That covert, which hath hidden from thy search"
17507,CANTO XIX,"The living justice, of the which thou mad’st"
17508,CANTO XIX,Such frequent question; for thou saidst—‘A man
17509,CANTO XIX,"Is born on Indus’ banks, and none is there"
17510,CANTO XIX,"Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,"
17511,CANTO XIX,"And all his inclinations and his acts,"
17512,CANTO XIX,"As far as human reason sees, are good,"
17513,CANTO XIX,And he offendeth not in word or deed.
17514,CANTO XIX,"But unbaptiz’d he dies, and void of faith."
17515,CANTO XIX,Where is the justice that condemns him? where
17516,CANTO XIX,"His blame, if he believeth not?’—What then,"
17517,CANTO XIX,"And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit"
17518,CANTO XIX,To judge at distance of a thousand miles
17519,CANTO XIX,With the short-sighted vision of a span?
17520,CANTO XIX,"To him, who subtilizes thus with me,"
17521,CANTO XIX,There would assuredly be room for doubt
17522,CANTO XIX,"Even to wonder, did not the safe word"
17523,CANTO XIX,Of scripture hold supreme authority.
17524,CANTO XIX,
17525,CANTO XIX,“O animals of clay! O spirits gross I
17526,CANTO XIX,"The primal will, that in itself is good,"
17527,CANTO XIX,"Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne’er been mov’d."
17528,CANTO XIX,"Justice consists in consonance with it,"
17529,CANTO XIX,"Derivable by no created good,"
17530,CANTO XIX,Whose very cause depends upon its beam.”
17531,CANTO XIX,
17532,CANTO XIX,"As on her nest the stork, that turns about"
17533,CANTO XIX,"Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed,"
17534,CANTO XIX,While they with upward eyes do look on her;
17535,CANTO XIX,So lifted I my gaze; and bending so
17536,CANTO XIX,"The ever-blessed image wav’d its wings,"
17537,CANTO XIX,Lab’ring with such deep counsel. Wheeling round
17538,CANTO XIX,"It warbled, and did say: “As are my notes"
17539,CANTO XIX,"To thee, who understand’st them not, such is"
17540,CANTO XIX,Th’ eternal judgment unto mortal ken.”
17541,CANTO XIX,
17542,CANTO XIX,"Then still abiding in that ensign rang’d,"
17543,CANTO XIX,"Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,"
17544,CANTO XIX,Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit
17545,CANTO XIX,Took up the strain; and thus it spake again:
17546,CANTO XIX,"“None ever hath ascended to this realm,"
17547,CANTO XIX,"Who hath not a believer been in Christ,"
17548,CANTO XIX,Either before or after the blest limbs
17549,CANTO XIX,Were nail’d upon the wood. But lo! of those
17550,CANTO XIX,"Who call ‘Christ, Christ,’ there shall be many found,"
17551,CANTO XIX,"In judgment, further off from him by far,"
17552,CANTO XIX,"Than such, to whom his name was never known."
17553,CANTO XIX,Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:
17554,CANTO XIX,When that the two assemblages shall part;
17555,CANTO XIX,"One rich eternally, the other poor."
17556,CANTO XIX,
17557,CANTO XIX,"“What may the Persians say unto your kings,"
17558,CANTO XIX,"When they shall see that volume, in the which"
17559,CANTO XIX,"All their dispraise is written, spread to view?"
17560,CANTO XIX,"There amidst Albert’s works shall that be read,"
17561,CANTO XIX,"Which will give speedy motion to the pen,"
17562,CANTO XIX,When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.
17563,CANTO XIX,"There shall be read the woe, that he doth work"
17564,CANTO XIX,"With his adulterate money on the Seine,"
17565,CANTO XIX,Who by the tusk will perish: there be read
17566,CANTO XIX,"The thirsting pride, that maketh fool alike"
17567,CANTO XIX,"The English and Scot, impatient of their bound."
17568,CANTO XIX,"There shall be seen the Spaniard’s luxury,"
17569,CANTO XIX,"The delicate living there of the Bohemian,"
17570,CANTO XIX,Who still to worth has been a willing stranger.
17571,CANTO XIX,The halter of Jerusalem shall see
17572,CANTO XIX,"A unit for his virtue, for his vices"
17573,CANTO XIX,"No less a mark than million. He, who guards"
17574,CANTO XIX,The isle of fire by old Anchises honour’d
17575,CANTO XIX,Shall find his avarice there and cowardice;
17576,CANTO XIX,"And better to denote his littleness,"
17577,CANTO XIX,"The writing must be letters maim’d, that speak"
17578,CANTO XIX,Much in a narrow space. All there shall know
17579,CANTO XIX,"His uncle and his brother’s filthy doings,"
17580,CANTO XIX,Who so renown’d a nation and two crowns
17581,CANTO XIX,"Have bastardized. And they, of Portugal"
17582,CANTO XIX,"And Norway, there shall be expos’d with him"
17583,CANTO XIX,"Of Ratza, who hath counterfeited ill"
17584,CANTO XIX,The coin of Venice. O blest Hungary!
17585,CANTO XIX,If thou no longer patiently abid’st
17586,CANTO XIX,"Thy ill-entreating! and, O blest Navarre!"
17587,CANTO XIX,If with thy mountainous girdle thou wouldst arm thee
17588,CANTO XIX,"In earnest of that day, e’en now are heard"
17589,CANTO XIX,Wailings and groans in Famagosta’s streets
17590,CANTO XIX,"And Nicosia’s, grudging at their beast,"
17591,CANTO XIX,Who keepeth even footing with the rest.”
17592,CANTO XIX,
17593,CANTO XIX,
17594,CANTO XIX,
17595,CANTO XIX,
17596,CANTO XX,CANTO XX
17597,CANTO XX,
17598,CANTO XX,
17599,CANTO XX,"When, disappearing, from our hemisphere,"
17600,CANTO XX,"The world’s enlightener vanishes, and day"
17601,CANTO XX,"On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,"
17602,CANTO XX,"Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,"
17603,CANTO XX,"Is yet again unfolded, putting forth"
17604,CANTO XX,Innumerable lights wherein one shines.
17605,CANTO XX,"Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,"
17606,CANTO XX,"As the great sign, that marshaleth the world"
17607,CANTO XX,"And the world’s leaders, in the blessed beak"
17608,CANTO XX,"Was silent; for that all those living lights,"
17609,CANTO XX,"Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,"
17610,CANTO XX,Such as from memory glide and fall away.
17611,CANTO XX,
17612,CANTO XX,"Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,"
17613,CANTO XX,"How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,"
17614,CANTO XX,Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir’d!
17615,CANTO XX,
17616,CANTO XX,"After the precious and bright beaming stones,"
17617,CANTO XX,"That did ingem the sixth light, ceas’d the chiming"
17618,CANTO XX,Of their angelic bells; methought I heard
17619,CANTO XX,"The murmuring of a river, that doth fall"
17620,CANTO XX,"From rock to rock transpicuous, making known"
17621,CANTO XX,The richness of his spring-head: and as sound
17622,CANTO XX,"Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,"
17623,CANTO XX,"Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun’d;"
17624,CANTO XX,"Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose"
17625,CANTO XX,"That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith"
17626,CANTO XX,"Voice there assum’d, and thence along the beak"
17627,CANTO XX,"Issued in form of words, such as my heart"
17628,CANTO XX,"Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib’d them."
17629,CANTO XX,
17630,CANTO XX,"“The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,"
17631,CANTO XX,"In mortal eagles,” it began, “must now"
17632,CANTO XX,"Be noted steadfastly: for of the fires,"
17633,CANTO XX,"That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,"
17634,CANTO XX,"Are chief of all the greatest. This, that shines"
17635,CANTO XX,"Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang"
17636,CANTO XX,"The Holy Spirit’s song, and bare about"
17637,CANTO XX,The ark from town to town; now doth he know
17638,CANTO XX,The merit of his soul-impassion’d strains
17639,CANTO XX,"By their well-fitted guerdon. Of the five,"
17640,CANTO XX,"That make the circle of the vision, he"
17641,CANTO XX,"Who to the beak is nearest, comforted"
17642,CANTO XX,The widow for her son: now doth he know
17643,CANTO XX,"How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,"
17644,CANTO XX,"Both from experience of this pleasant life,"
17645,CANTO XX,"And of its opposite. He next, who follows"
17646,CANTO XX,"In the circumference, for the over arch,"
17647,CANTO XX,By true repenting slack’d the pace of death:
17648,CANTO XX,"Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav’n"
17649,CANTO XX,"Alter not, when through pious prayer below"
17650,CANTO XX,Today’s is made tomorrow’s destiny.
17651,CANTO XX,"The other following, with the laws and me,"
17652,CANTO XX,"To yield the shepherd room, pass’d o’er to Greece,"
17653,CANTO XX,From good intent producing evil fruit:
17654,CANTO XX,"Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv’d"
17655,CANTO XX,"From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,"
17656,CANTO XX,Though it have brought destruction on the world.
17657,CANTO XX,"That, which thou seest in the under bow,"
17658,CANTO XX,"Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps"
17659,CANTO XX,For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows
17660,CANTO XX,"How well is lov’d in heav’n the righteous king,"
17661,CANTO XX,Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.
17662,CANTO XX,"Who in the erring world beneath would deem,"
17663,CANTO XX,That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set
17664,CANTO XX,Fifth of the saintly splendours? now he knows
17665,CANTO XX,"Enough of that, which the world cannot see,"
17666,CANTO XX,"The grace divine, albeit e’en his sight"
17667,CANTO XX,"Reach not its utmost depth.” Like to the lark,"
17668,CANTO XX,"That warbling in the air expatiates long,"
17669,CANTO XX,"Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,"
17670,CANTO XX,Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear’d
17671,CANTO XX,"That image stampt by the’ everlasting pleasure,"
17672,CANTO XX,Which fashions like itself all lovely things.
17673,CANTO XX,
17674,CANTO XX,"I, though my doubting were as manifest,"
17675,CANTO XX,"As is through glass the hue that mantles it,"
17676,CANTO XX,In silence waited not: for to my lips
17677,CANTO XX,"“What things are these?” involuntary rush’d,"
17678,CANTO XX,And forc’d a passage out: whereat I mark’d
17679,CANTO XX,A sudden lightening and new revelry.
17680,CANTO XX,The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign
17681,CANTO XX,"No more to keep me wond’ring and suspense,"
17682,CANTO XX,"Replied: “I see that thou believ’st these things,"
17683,CANTO XX,"Because I tell them, but discern’st not how;"
17684,CANTO XX,So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:
17685,CANTO XX,"As one who knows the name of thing by rote,"
17686,CANTO XX,"But is a stranger to its properties,"
17687,CANTO XX,Till other’s tongue reveal them. Fervent love
17688,CANTO XX,And lively hope with violence assail
17689,CANTO XX,"The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome"
17690,CANTO XX,The will of the Most high; not in such sort
17691,CANTO XX,"As man prevails o’er man; but conquers it,"
17692,CANTO XX,"Because ’tis willing to be conquer’d, still,"
17693,CANTO XX,"Though conquer’d, by its mercy conquering."
17694,CANTO XX,
17695,CANTO XX,"“Those, in the eye who live the first and fifth,"
17696,CANTO XX,"Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold’st"
17697,CANTO XX,The region of the angels deck’d with them.
17698,CANTO XX,"They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem’st,"
17699,CANTO XX,"Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,"
17700,CANTO XX,"This of the feet in future to be pierc’d,"
17701,CANTO XX,That of feet nail’d already to the cross.
17702,CANTO XX,"One from the barrier of the dark abyss,"
17703,CANTO XX,"Where never any with good will returns,"
17704,CANTO XX,Came back unto his bones. Of lively hope
17705,CANTO XX,"Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing’d"
17706,CANTO XX,"The prayers sent up to God for his release,"
17707,CANTO XX,And put power into them to bend his will.
17708,CANTO XX,"The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,"
17709,CANTO XX,"A little while returning to the flesh,"
17710,CANTO XX,"Believ’d in him, who had the means to help,"
17711,CANTO XX,"And, in believing, nourish’d such a flame"
17712,CANTO XX,"Of holy love, that at the second death"
17713,CANTO XX,He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.
17714,CANTO XX,"The other, through the riches of that grace,"
17715,CANTO XX,"Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,"
17716,CANTO XX,"As never eye created saw its rising,"
17717,CANTO XX,Plac’d all his love below on just and right:
17718,CANTO XX,Wherefore of grace God op’d in him the eye
17719,CANTO XX,To the redemption of mankind to come;
17720,CANTO XX,"Wherein believing, he endur’d no more"
17721,CANTO XX,"The filth of paganism, and for their ways"
17722,CANTO XX,"Rebuk’d the stubborn nations. The three nymphs,"
17723,CANTO XX,"Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,"
17724,CANTO XX,Were sponsors for him more than thousand years
17725,CANTO XX,"Before baptizing. O how far remov’d,"
17726,CANTO XX,Predestination! is thy root from such
17727,CANTO XX,"As see not the First cause entire: and ye,"
17728,CANTO XX,O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:
17729,CANTO XX,"For we, who see our Maker, know not yet"
17730,CANTO XX,The number of the chosen: and esteem
17731,CANTO XX,Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:
17732,CANTO XX,For all our good is in that primal good
17733,CANTO XX,"Concentrate, and God’s will and ours are one.”"
17734,CANTO XX,
17735,CANTO XX,"So, by that form divine, was giv’n to me"
17736,CANTO XX,"Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,"
17737,CANTO XX,"And, as one handling skillfully the harp,"
17738,CANTO XX,Attendant on some skilful songster’s voice
17739,CANTO XX,"Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song"
17740,CANTO XX,"Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,"
17741,CANTO XX,"It doth remember me, that I beheld"
17742,CANTO XX,The pair of blessed luminaries move.
17743,CANTO XX,"Like the accordant twinkling of two eyes,"
17744,CANTO XX,"Their beamy circlets, dancing to the sounds."

17752,CANTO XXI,"Again mine eyes were fix’d on Beatrice,"
17753,CANTO XXI,"And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks"
17754,CANTO XXI,Found all contentment. Yet no smile she wore
17755,CANTO XXI,"And, “Did I smile,” quoth she, “thou wouldst be straight"
17756,CANTO XXI,Like Semele when into ashes turn’d:
17757,CANTO XXI,"For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,"
17758,CANTO XXI,"My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,"
17759,CANTO XXI,"As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,"
17760,CANTO XXI,"So shines, that, were no temp’ring interpos’d,"
17761,CANTO XXI,Thy mortal puissance would from its rays
17762,CANTO XXI,"Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt."
17763,CANTO XXI,"Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,"
17764,CANTO XXI,That underneath the burning lion’s breast
17765,CANTO XXI,"Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might,"
17766,CANTO XXI,Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror’d
17767,CANTO XXI,"The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown.”"
17768,CANTO XXI,"Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed"
17769,CANTO XXI,"My sight upon her blissful countenance,"
17770,CANTO XXI,"May know, when to new thoughts I chang’d, what joy"
17771,CANTO XXI,To do the bidding of my heav’nly guide:
17772,CANTO XXI,In equal balance poising either weight.
17773,CANTO XXI,
17774,CANTO XXI,"Within the crystal, which records the name,"
17775,CANTO XXI,(As its remoter circle girds the world)
17776,CANTO XXI,"Of that lov’d monarch, in whose happy reign"
17777,CANTO XXI,"No ill had power to harm, I saw rear’d up,"
17778,CANTO XXI,In colour like to sun-illumin’d gold.
17779,CANTO XXI,"A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,"
17780,CANTO XXI,So lofty was the summit; down whose steps
17781,CANTO XXI,I saw the splendours in such multitude
17782,CANTO XXI,"Descending, ev’ry light in heav’n, methought,"
17783,CANTO XXI,"Was shed thence. As the rooks, at dawn of day"
17784,CANTO XXI,"Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,"
17785,CANTO XXI,"Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,"
17786,CANTO XXI,"Returning, cross their flight, while some abide"
17787,CANTO XXI,And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem’d
17788,CANTO XXI,"That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,"
17789,CANTO XXI,"As upon certain stair it met, and clash’d"
17790,CANTO XXI,"Its shining. And one ling’ring near us, wax’d"
17791,CANTO XXI,"So bright, that in my thought: said: “The love,"
17792,CANTO XXI,"Which this betokens me, admits no doubt.”"
17793,CANTO XXI,
17794,CANTO XXI,"Unwillingly from question I refrain,"
17795,CANTO XXI,"To her, by whom my silence and my speech"
17796,CANTO XXI,"Are order’d, looking for a sign: whence she,"
17797,CANTO XXI,"Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,"
17798,CANTO XXI,"Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me"
17799,CANTO XXI,T’ indulge the fervent wish; and I began:
17800,CANTO XXI,"“I am not worthy, of my own desert,"
17801,CANTO XXI,"That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,"
17802,CANTO XXI,"Who hath vouchsaf’d my asking, spirit blest!"
17803,CANTO XXI,"That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,"
17804,CANTO XXI,"Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,"
17805,CANTO XXI,Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise
17806,CANTO XXI,"Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds"
17807,CANTO XXI,Of rapt devotion ev’ry lower sphere?”
17808,CANTO XXI,“Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;”
17809,CANTO XXI,Was the reply: “and what forbade the smile
17810,CANTO XXI,Of Beatrice interrupts our song.
17811,CANTO XXI,"Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,"
17812,CANTO XXI,"And of the light that vests me, I thus far"
17813,CANTO XXI,Descend these hallow’d steps: not that more love
17814,CANTO XXI,"Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much"
17815,CANTO XXI,Or more of love is witness’d in those flames:
17816,CANTO XXI,"But such my lot by charity assign’d,"
17817,CANTO XXI,"That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,"
17818,CANTO XXI,To execute the counsel of the Highest.
17819,CANTO XXI,"“That in this court,” said I, “O sacred lamp!"
17820,CANTO XXI,"Love no compulsion needs, but follows free"
17821,CANTO XXI,"Th’ eternal Providence, I well discern:"
17822,CANTO XXI,"This harder find to deem, why of thy peers"
17823,CANTO XXI,Thou only to this office wert foredoom’d.”
17824,CANTO XXI,"I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,"
17825,CANTO XXI,Upon its centre whirl’d the light; and then
17826,CANTO XXI,"The love, that did inhabit there, replied:"
17827,CANTO XXI,"“Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,"
17828,CANTO XXI,"Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus"
17829,CANTO XXI,"Supported, lifts me so above myself,"
17830,CANTO XXI,"That on the sov’ran essence, which it wells from,"
17831,CANTO XXI,"I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,"
17832,CANTO XXI,"Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze"
17833,CANTO XXI,"The keenness of my sight. But not the soul,"
17834,CANTO XXI,"That is in heav’n most lustrous, nor the seraph"
17835,CANTO XXI,"That hath his eyes most fix’d on God, shall solve"
17836,CANTO XXI,What thou hast ask’d: for in th’ abyss it lies
17837,CANTO XXI,"Of th’ everlasting statute sunk so low,"
17838,CANTO XXI,That no created ken may fathom it.
17839,CANTO XXI,"And, to the mortal world when thou return’st,"
17840,CANTO XXI,Be this reported; that none henceforth dare
17841,CANTO XXI,Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.
17842,CANTO XXI,"The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth"
17843,CANTO XXI,"Is wrapt in mist. Look then if she may do,"
17844,CANTO XXI,"Below, what passeth her ability,"
17845,CANTO XXI,When she is ta’en to heav’n.” By words like these
17846,CANTO XXI,"Admonish’d, I the question urg’d no more;"
17847,CANTO XXI,And of the spirit humbly sued alone
17848,CANTO XXI,T’ instruct me of its state. “’Twixt either shore
17849,CANTO XXI,"Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,"
17850,CANTO XXI,"A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,"
17851,CANTO XXI,"The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,"
17852,CANTO XXI,They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell
17853,CANTO XXI,"Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,"
17854,CANTO XXI,For worship set apart and holy rites.”
17855,CANTO XXI,A third time thus it spake; then added: “There
17856,CANTO XXI,"So firmly to God’s service I adher’d,"
17857,CANTO XXI,That with no costlier viands than the juice
17858,CANTO XXI,"Of olives, easily I pass’d the heats"
17859,CANTO XXI,"Of summer and the winter frosts, content"
17860,CANTO XXI,In heav’n-ward musings. Rich were the returns
17861,CANTO XXI,"And fertile, which that cloister once was us’d"
17862,CANTO XXI,To render to these heavens: now ’tis fall’n
17863,CANTO XXI,"Into a waste so empty, that ere long"
17864,CANTO XXI,Detection must lay bare its vanity
17865,CANTO XXI,Pietro Damiano there was I y-clept:
17866,CANTO XXI,"Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt"
17867,CANTO XXI,"Beside the Adriatic, in the house"
17868,CANTO XXI,Of our blest Lady. Near upon my close
17869,CANTO XXI,"Of mortal life, through much importuning"
17870,CANTO XXI,I was constrain’d to wear the hat that still
17871,CANTO XXI,From bad to worse it shifted.—Cephas came;
17872,CANTO XXI,"He came, who was the Holy Spirit’s vessel,"
17873,CANTO XXI,"Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc’d,"
17874,CANTO XXI,At the first table. Modern Shepherd’s need
17875,CANTO XXI,"Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,"
17876,CANTO XXI,So burly are they grown: and from behind
17877,CANTO XXI,Others to hoist them. Down the palfrey’s sides
17878,CANTO XXI,"Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts"
17879,CANTO XXI,Are cover’d with one skin. O patience! thou
17880,CANTO XXI,That lookst on this and doth endure so long.”
17881,CANTO XXI,I at those accents saw the splendours down
17882,CANTO XXI,"From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,"
17883,CANTO XXI,"Each circuiting, more beautiful. Round this"
17884,CANTO XXI,"They came, and stay’d them; uttered them a shout"
17885,CANTO XXI,"So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I"
17886,CANTO XXI,"Wist what it spake, so deaf’ning was the thunder."
17887,CANTO XXI,
17888,CANTO XXI,
17889,CANTO XXI,
17890,CANTO XXI,
17891,CANTO XXII,CANTO XXII
17892,CANTO XXII,
17893,CANTO XXII,
17894,CANTO XXII,"Astounded, to the guardian of my steps"
17895,CANTO XXII,"I turn’d me, like the chill, who always runs"
17896,CANTO XXII,"Thither for succour, where he trusteth most,"
17897,CANTO XXII,"And she was like the mother, who her son"
17898,CANTO XXII,"Beholding pale and breathless, with her voice"
17899,CANTO XXII,"Soothes him, and he is cheer’d; for thus she spake,"
17900,CANTO XXII,"Soothing me: “Know’st not thou, thou art in heav’n?"
17901,CANTO XXII,"And know’st not thou, whatever is in heav’n,"
17902,CANTO XXII,"Is holy, and that nothing there is done"
17903,CANTO XXII,"But is done zealously and well? Deem now,"
17904,CANTO XXII,"What change in thee the song, and what my smile"
17905,CANTO XXII,"had wrought, since thus the shout had pow’r to move thee."
17906,CANTO XXII,"In which couldst thou have understood their prayers,"
17907,CANTO XXII,"The vengeance were already known to thee,"
17908,CANTO XXII,"Which thou must witness ere thy mortal hour,"
17909,CANTO XXII,"The sword of heav’n is not in haste to smite,"
17910,CANTO XXII,"Nor yet doth linger, save unto his seeming,"
17911,CANTO XXII,Who in desire or fear doth look for it.
17912,CANTO XXII,But elsewhere now l bid thee turn thy view;
17913,CANTO XXII,So shalt thou many a famous spirit behold.”
17914,CANTO XXII,"Mine eyes directing, as she will’d, I saw"
17915,CANTO XXII,"A hundred little spheres, that fairer grew"
17916,CANTO XXII,"By interchange of splendour. I remain’d,"
17917,CANTO XXII,"As one, who fearful of o’er-much presuming,"
17918,CANTO XXII,"Abates in him the keenness of desire,"
17919,CANTO XXII,"Nor dares to question, when amid those pearls,"
17920,CANTO XXII,"One largest and most lustrous onward drew,"
17921,CANTO XXII,That it might yield contentment to my wish;
17922,CANTO XXII,And from within it these the sounds I heard.
17923,CANTO XXII,
17924,CANTO XXII,"“If thou, like me, beheldst the charity"
17925,CANTO XXII,"That burns amongst us, what thy mind conceives,"
17926,CANTO XXII,"Were utter’d. But that, ere the lofty bound"
17927,CANTO XXII,"Thou reach, expectance may not weary thee,"
17928,CANTO XXII,"I will make answer even to the thought,"
17929,CANTO XXII,"Which thou hast such respect of. In old days,"
17930,CANTO XXII,"That mountain, at whose side Cassino rests,"
17931,CANTO XXII,Was on its height frequented by a race
17932,CANTO XXII,"Deceived and ill dispos’d: and I it was,"
17933,CANTO XXII,"Who thither carried first the name of Him,"
17934,CANTO XXII,Who brought the soul-subliming truth to man.
17935,CANTO XXII,"And such a speeding grace shone over me,"
17936,CANTO XXII,That from their impious worship I reclaim’d
17937,CANTO XXII,"The dwellers round about, who with the world"
17938,CANTO XXII,"Were in delusion lost. These other flames,"
17939,CANTO XXII,"The spirits of men contemplative, were all"
17940,CANTO XXII,"Enliven’d by that warmth, whose kindly force"
17941,CANTO XXII,Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.
17942,CANTO XXII,Here is Macarius; Romoaldo here:
17943,CANTO XXII,"And here my brethren, who their steps refrain’d"
17944,CANTO XXII,"Within the cloisters, and held firm their heart.”"
17945,CANTO XXII,
17946,CANTO XXII,"I answ’ring, thus; “Thy gentle words and kind,"
17947,CANTO XXII,"And this the cheerful semblance, I behold"
17948,CANTO XXII,"Not unobservant, beaming in ye all,"
17949,CANTO XXII,"Have rais’d assurance in me, wakening it"
17950,CANTO XXII,"Full-blossom’d in my bosom, as a rose"
17951,CANTO XXII,"Before the sun, when the consummate flower"
17952,CANTO XXII,Has spread to utmost amplitude. Of thee
17953,CANTO XXII,"Therefore entreat I, father! to declare"
17954,CANTO XXII,"If I may gain such favour, as to gaze"
17955,CANTO XXII,"Upon thine image, by no covering veil’d.”"
17956,CANTO XXII,
17957,CANTO XXII,"“Brother!” he thus rejoin’d, “in the last sphere"
17958,CANTO XXII,"Expect completion of thy lofty aim,"
17959,CANTO XXII,"For there on each desire completion waits,"
17960,CANTO XXII,And there on mine: where every aim is found
17961,CANTO XXII,"Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe."
17962,CANTO XXII,There all things are as they have ever been:
17963,CANTO XXII,"For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,"
17964,CANTO XXII,"Our ladder reaches even to that clime,"
17965,CANTO XXII,And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.
17966,CANTO XXII,Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch
17967,CANTO XXII,"Its topmost round, when it appear’d to him"
17968,CANTO XXII,With angels laden. But to mount it now
17969,CANTO XXII,None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule
17970,CANTO XXII,Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;
17971,CANTO XXII,"The walls, for abbey rear’d, turned into dens,"
17972,CANTO XXII,The cowls to sacks choak’d up with musty meal.
17973,CANTO XXII,Foul usury doth not more lift itself
17974,CANTO XXII,"Against God’s pleasure, than that fruit which makes"
17975,CANTO XXII,The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate’er
17976,CANTO XXII,"Is in the church’s keeping, all pertains."
17977,CANTO XXII,"To such, as sue for heav’n’s sweet sake, and not"
17978,CANTO XXII,"To those who in respect of kindred claim,"
17979,CANTO XXII,Or on more vile allowance. Mortal flesh
17980,CANTO XXII,"Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not"
17981,CANTO XXII,"From the oak’s birth, unto the acorn’s setting."
17982,CANTO XXII,His convent Peter founded without gold
17983,CANTO XXII,Or silver; I with pray’rs and fasting mine;
17984,CANTO XXII,And Francis his in meek humility.
17985,CANTO XXII,"And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,"
17986,CANTO XXII,"Then look what it hath err’d to, thou shalt find"
17987,CANTO XXII,The white grown murky. Jordan was turn’d back;
17988,CANTO XXII,"And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,"
17989,CANTO XXII,May at God’s pleasure work amendment here.”
17990,CANTO XXII,
17991,CANTO XXII,"So saying, to his assembly back he drew:"
17992,CANTO XXII,"And they together cluster’d into one,"
17993,CANTO XXII,Then all roll’d upward like an eddying wind.
17994,CANTO XXII,
17995,CANTO XXII,The sweet dame beckon’d me to follow them:
17996,CANTO XXII,"And, by that influence only, so prevail’d"
17997,CANTO XXII,"Over my nature, that no natural motion,"
17998,CANTO XXII,"Ascending or descending here below,"
17999,CANTO XXII,"Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied."
18000,CANTO XXII,
18001,CANTO XXII,"So, reader, as my hope is to return"
18002,CANTO XXII,"Unto the holy triumph, for the which"
18003,CANTO XXII,"I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,"
18004,CANTO XXII,Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting
18005,CANTO XXII,"Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere"
18006,CANTO XXII,"The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,"
18007,CANTO XXII,And enter’d its precinct. O glorious stars!
18008,CANTO XXII,O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!
18009,CANTO XXII,To whom whate’er of genius lifteth me
18010,CANTO XXII,"Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;"
18011,CANTO XXII,With ye the parent of all mortal life
18012,CANTO XXII,"Arose and set, when I did first inhale"
18013,CANTO XXII,"The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace"
18014,CANTO XXII,Vouchsaf’d me entrance to the lofty wheel
18015,CANTO XXII,"That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed"
18016,CANTO XXII,My passage at your clime. To you my soul
18017,CANTO XXII,"Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now"
18018,CANTO XXII,To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.
18019,CANTO XXII,
18020,CANTO XXII,"“Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,”"
18021,CANTO XXII,"Said Beatrice, “that behooves thy ken"
18022,CANTO XXII,"Be vigilant and clear. And, to this end,"
18023,CANTO XXII,"Or even thou advance thee further, hence"
18024,CANTO XXII,"Look downward, and contemplate, what a world"
18025,CANTO XXII,Already stretched under our feet there lies:
18026,CANTO XXII,"So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,"
18027,CANTO XXII,"Present itself to the triumphal throng,"
18028,CANTO XXII,Which through the’ etherial concave comes rejoicing.”
18029,CANTO XXII,
18030,CANTO XXII,I straight obey’d; and with mine eye return’d
18031,CANTO XXII,"Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe"
18032,CANTO XXII,"So pitiful of semblance, that perforce"
18033,CANTO XXII,It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold
18034,CANTO XXII,"For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts"
18035,CANTO XXII,"Elsewhere are fix’d, him worthiest call and best."
18036,CANTO XXII,I saw the daughter of Latona shine
18037,CANTO XXII,"Without the shadow, whereof late I deem’d"
18038,CANTO XXII,That dense and rare were cause. Here I sustain’d
18039,CANTO XXII,"The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;"
18040,CANTO XXII,"And mark’d, how near him with their circle, round"
18041,CANTO XXII,Move Maia and Dione; here discern’d
18042,CANTO XXII,Jove’s tempering ’twixt his sire and son; and hence
18043,CANTO XXII,Their changes and their various aspects
18044,CANTO XXII,Distinctly scann’d. Nor might I not descry
18045,CANTO XXII,"Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;"
18046,CANTO XXII,Nor of their several distances not learn.
18047,CANTO XXII,This petty area (o’er the which we stride
18048,CANTO XXII,"So fiercely), as along the eternal twins"
18049,CANTO XXII,"I wound my way, appear’d before me all,"
18050,CANTO XXII,Forth from the havens stretch’d unto the hills.
18051,CANTO XXII,Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return’d.
18052,CANTO XXII,
18053,CANTO XXII,
18054,CANTO XXII,
18055,CANTO XXII,
18056,CANTO XXIII,CANTO XXIII
18057,CANTO XXIII,
18058,CANTO XXIII,
18059,CANTO XXIII,"E’en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower"
18060,CANTO XXIII,"Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,"
18061,CANTO XXIII,"With her sweet brood, impatient to descry"
18062,CANTO XXIII,"Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,"
18063,CANTO XXIII,In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:
18064,CANTO XXIII,"She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,"
18065,CANTO XXIII,"That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze"
18066,CANTO XXIII,"Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,"
18067,CANTO XXIII,Removeth from the east her eager ken;
18068,CANTO XXIII,"So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance"
18069,CANTO XXIII,"Wistfully on that region, where the sun"
18070,CANTO XXIII,"Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her"
18071,CANTO XXIII,"Suspense and wand’ring, I became as one,"
18072,CANTO XXIII,"In whom desire is waken’d, and the hope"
18073,CANTO XXIII,Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.
18074,CANTO XXIII,
18075,CANTO XXIII,"Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,"
18076,CANTO XXIII,"Long in expectance, when I saw the heav’n"
18077,CANTO XXIII,"Wax more and more resplendent; and, “Behold,”"
18078,CANTO XXIII,"Cried Beatrice, “the triumphal hosts"
18079,CANTO XXIII,"Of Christ, and all the harvest reap’d at length"
18080,CANTO XXIII,"Of thy ascending up these spheres.” Meseem’d,"
18081,CANTO XXIII,"That, while she spake her image all did burn,"
18082,CANTO XXIII,"And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,"
18083,CANTO XXIII,And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.
18084,CANTO XXIII,
18085,CANTO XXIII,"As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,"
18086,CANTO XXIII,"In peerless beauty, ’mid th’ eternal nympus,"
18087,CANTO XXIII,That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound
18088,CANTO XXIII,"In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,"
18089,CANTO XXIII,"O’er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew"
18090,CANTO XXIII,Their radiance as from ours the starry train:
18091,CANTO XXIII,And through the living light so lustrous glow’d
18092,CANTO XXIII,"The substance, that my ken endur’d it not."
18093,CANTO XXIII,
18094,CANTO XXIII,O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!
18095,CANTO XXIII,Who cheer’d me with her comfortable words!
18096,CANTO XXIII,"“Against the virtue, that o’erpow’reth thee,"
18097,CANTO XXIII,"Avails not to resist. Here is the might,"
18098,CANTO XXIII,"And here the wisdom, which did open lay"
18099,CANTO XXIII,"The path, that had been yearned for so long,"
18100,CANTO XXIII,"Betwixt the heav’n and earth.” Like to the fire,"
18101,CANTO XXIII,"That, in a cloud imprison’d doth break out"
18102,CANTO XXIII,"Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg’d,"
18103,CANTO XXIII,It falleth against nature to the ground;
18104,CANTO XXIII,Thus in that heav’nly banqueting my soul
18105,CANTO XXIII,"Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost."
18106,CANTO XXIII,Holds now remembrance none of what she was.
18107,CANTO XXIII,
18108,CANTO XXIII,"“Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen"
18109,CANTO XXIII,"Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile.”"
18110,CANTO XXIII,
18111,CANTO XXIII,"I was as one, when a forgotten dream"
18112,CANTO XXIII,"Doth come across him, and he strives in vain"
18113,CANTO XXIII,"To shape it in his fantasy again,"
18114,CANTO XXIII,"Whenas that gracious boon was proffer’d me,"
18115,CANTO XXIII,"Which never may be cancel’d from the book,"
18116,CANTO XXIII,Wherein the past is written. Now were all
18117,CANTO XXIII,"Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk"
18118,CANTO XXIII,Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed
18119,CANTO XXIII,"And fatten’d, not with all their help to boot,"
18120,CANTO XXIII,"Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,"
18121,CANTO XXIII,"My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,"
18122,CANTO XXIII,flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.
18123,CANTO XXIII,And with such figuring of Paradise
18124,CANTO XXIII,"The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets"
18125,CANTO XXIII,A sudden interruption to his road.
18126,CANTO XXIII,"But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,"
18127,CANTO XXIII,"And that ’tis lain upon a mortal shoulder,"
18128,CANTO XXIII,"May pardon, if it tremble with the burden."
18129,CANTO XXIII,"The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks"
18130,CANTO XXIII,"No unribb’d pinnace, no self-sparing pilot."
18131,CANTO XXIII,
18132,CANTO XXIII,"“Why doth my face,” said Beatrice, “thus"
18133,CANTO XXIII,"Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn"
18134,CANTO XXIII,"Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming"
18135,CANTO XXIII,"Beneath the rays of Christ? Here is the rose,"
18136,CANTO XXIII,Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;
18137,CANTO XXIII,"And here the lilies, by whose odour known"
18138,CANTO XXIII,The way of life was follow’d.” Prompt I heard
18139,CANTO XXIII,"Her bidding, and encounter once again"
18140,CANTO XXIII,"The strife of aching vision. As erewhile,"
18141,CANTO XXIII,"Through glance of sunlight, stream’d through broken cloud,"
18142,CANTO XXIII,"Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,"
18143,CANTO XXIII,Though veil’d themselves in shade; so saw I there
18144,CANTO XXIII,"Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays"
18145,CANTO XXIII,"Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not"
18146,CANTO XXIII,The fountain whence they flow’d. O gracious virtue!
18147,CANTO XXIII,"Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up"
18148,CANTO XXIII,Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room
18149,CANTO XXIII,To my o’erlabour’d sight: when at the name
18150,CANTO XXIII,"Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke"
18151,CANTO XXIII,"Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might"
18152,CANTO XXIII,"Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix’d."
18153,CANTO XXIII,"And, as the bright dimensions of the star"
18154,CANTO XXIII,"In heav’n excelling, as once here on earth"
18155,CANTO XXIII,"Were, in my eyeballs lively portray’d,"
18156,CANTO XXIII,"Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,"
18157,CANTO XXIII,"Circling in fashion of a diadem,"
18158,CANTO XXIII,"And girt the star, and hov’ring round it wheel’d."
18159,CANTO XXIII,
18160,CANTO XXIII,"Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,"
18161,CANTO XXIII,"And draws the spirit most unto itself,"
18162,CANTO XXIII,"Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,"
18163,CANTO XXIII,"Compar’d unto the sounding of that lyre,"
18164,CANTO XXIII,"Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays"
18165,CANTO XXIII,"The floor of heav’n, was crown’d. “ Angelic Love"
18166,CANTO XXIII,"I am, who thus with hov’ring flight enwheel"
18167,CANTO XXIII,"The lofty rapture from that womb inspir’d,"
18168,CANTO XXIII,"Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,"
18169,CANTO XXIII,Lady of Heav’n! will hover; long as thou
18170,CANTO XXIII,"Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy"
18171,CANTO XXIII,Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere.”
18172,CANTO XXIII,
18173,CANTO XXIII,Such close was to the circling melody:
18174,CANTO XXIII,"And, as it ended, all the other lights"
18175,CANTO XXIII,"Took up the strain, and echoed Mary’s name."
18176,CANTO XXIII,
18177,CANTO XXIII,"The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps"
18178,CANTO XXIII,"The world, and with the nearer breath of God"
18179,CANTO XXIII,"Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir’d"
18180,CANTO XXIII,"Its inner hem and skirting over us,"
18181,CANTO XXIII,That yet no glimmer of its majesty
18182,CANTO XXIII,Had stream’d unto me: therefore were mine eyes
18183,CANTO XXIII,"Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,"
18184,CANTO XXIII,That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;
18185,CANTO XXIII,"And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms"
18186,CANTO XXIII,"For very eagerness towards the breast,"
18187,CANTO XXIII,After the milk is taken; so outstretch’d
18188,CANTO XXIII,"Their wavy summits all the fervent band,"
18189,CANTO XXIII,Through zealous love to Mary: then in view
18190,CANTO XXIII,"There halted, and “Regina Coeli “ sang"
18191,CANTO XXIII,"So sweetly, the delight hath left me never."
18192,CANTO XXIII,
18193,CANTO XXIII,O what o’erflowing plenty is up-pil’d
18194,CANTO XXIII,"In those rich-laden coffers, which below"
18195,CANTO XXIII,"Sow’d the good seed, whose harvest now they keep."
18196,CANTO XXIII,
18197,CANTO XXIII,"Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears"
18198,CANTO XXIII,"Were in the Babylonian exile won,"
18199,CANTO XXIII,When gold had fail’d them. Here in synod high
18200,CANTO XXIII,"Of ancient council with the new conven’d,"
18201,CANTO XXIII,"Under the Son of Mary and of God,"
18202,CANTO XXIII,"Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,"
18203,CANTO XXIII,To whom the keys of glory were assign’d.
18204,CANTO XXIII,
18205,CANTO XXIII,
18206,CANTO XXIII,
18207,CANTO XXIII,
18208,CANTO XXIV,CANTO XXIV
18209,CANTO XXIV,
18210,CANTO XXIV,
18211,CANTO XXIV,“O ye! in chosen fellowship advanc’d
18212,CANTO XXIV,"To the great supper of the blessed Lamb,"
18213,CANTO XXIV,Whereon who feeds hath every wish fulfill’d!
18214,CANTO XXIV,If to this man through God’s grace be vouchsaf’d
18215,CANTO XXIV,"Foretaste of that, which from your table falls,"
18216,CANTO XXIV,Or ever death his fated term prescribe;
18217,CANTO XXIV,Be ye not heedless of his urgent will;
18218,CANTO XXIV,But may some influence of your sacred dews
18219,CANTO XXIV,"Sprinkle him. Of the fount ye alway drink,"
18220,CANTO XXIV,"Whence flows what most he craves.” Beatrice spake,"
18221,CANTO XXIV,"And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres"
18222,CANTO XXIV,"On firm-set poles revolving, trail’d a blaze"
18223,CANTO XXIV,"Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind"
18224,CANTO XXIV,"Their circles in the horologe, so work"
18225,CANTO XXIV,"The stated rounds, that to th’ observant eye"
18226,CANTO XXIV,"The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;"
18227,CANTO XXIV,"E’en thus their carols weaving variously,"
18228,CANTO XXIV,"They by the measure pac’d, or swift, or slow,"
18229,CANTO XXIV,Made me to rate the riches of their joy.
18230,CANTO XXIV,
18231,CANTO XXIV,"From that, which I did note in beauty most"
18232,CANTO XXIV,"Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame"
18233,CANTO XXIV,"So bright, as none was left more goodly there."
18234,CANTO XXIV,"Round Beatrice thrice it wheel’d about,"
18235,CANTO XXIV,"With so divine a song, that fancy’s ear"
18236,CANTO XXIV,Records it not; and the pen passeth on
18237,CANTO XXIV,"And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,"
18238,CANTO XXIV,"Nor e’en the inward shaping of the brain,"
18239,CANTO XXIV,Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.
18240,CANTO XXIV,
18241,CANTO XXIV,“O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout
18242,CANTO XXIV,"Is with so vehement affection urg’d,"
18243,CANTO XXIV,Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere.”
18244,CANTO XXIV,
18245,CANTO XXIV,Such were the accents towards my lady breath’d
18246,CANTO XXIV,"From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay’d:"
18247,CANTO XXIV,To whom she thus: “O everlasting light
18248,CANTO XXIV,"Of him, within whose mighty grasp our Lord"
18249,CANTO XXIV,"Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss"
18250,CANTO XXIV,"He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,"
18251,CANTO XXIV,"With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,"
18252,CANTO XXIV,By the which thou didst on the billows walk.
18253,CANTO XXIV,"If he in love, in hope, and in belief,"
18254,CANTO XXIV,"Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou"
18255,CANTO XXIV,"Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld"
18256,CANTO XXIV,In liveliest portraiture. But since true faith
18257,CANTO XXIV,"Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,"
18258,CANTO XXIV,"Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,"
18259,CANTO XXIV,Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse.”
18260,CANTO XXIV,
18261,CANTO XXIV,"Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,"
18262,CANTO XXIV,"And speaks not, till the master have propos’d"
18263,CANTO XXIV,"The question, to approve, and not to end it;"
18264,CANTO XXIV,"So I, in silence, arm’d me, while she spake,"
18265,CANTO XXIV,Summoning up each argument to aid;
18266,CANTO XXIV,"As was behooveful for such questioner,"
18267,CANTO XXIV,"And such profession: “As good Christian ought,"
18268,CANTO XXIV,"Declare thee, What is faith?” Whereat I rais’d"
18269,CANTO XXIV,"My forehead to the light, whence this had breath’d,"
18270,CANTO XXIV,"Then turn’d to Beatrice, and in her looks"
18271,CANTO XXIV,"Approval met, that from their inmost fount"
18272,CANTO XXIV,"I should unlock the waters. “May the grace,"
18273,CANTO XXIV,That giveth me the captain of the church
18274,CANTO XXIV,"For confessor,” said I, “vouchsafe to me"
18275,CANTO XXIV,Apt utterance for my thoughts!” then added: “Sire!
18276,CANTO XXIV,E’en as set down by the unerring style
18277,CANTO XXIV,"Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir’d"
18278,CANTO XXIV,"To bring Rome in unto the way of life,"
18279,CANTO XXIV,"Faith of things hop’d is substance, and the proof"
18280,CANTO XXIV,Of things not seen; and herein doth consist
18281,CANTO XXIV,"Methinks its essence,”—” Rightly hast thou deem’d,”"
18282,CANTO XXIV,"Was answer’d: “if thou well discern, why first"
18283,CANTO XXIV,"He hath defin’d it, substance, and then proof.”"
18284,CANTO XXIV,
18285,CANTO XXIV,"“The deep things,” I replied, “which here I scan"
18286,CANTO XXIV,"Distinctly, are below from mortal eye"
18287,CANTO XXIV,"So hidden, they have in belief alone"
18288,CANTO XXIV,"Their being, on which credence hope sublime"
18289,CANTO XXIV,Is built; and therefore substance it intends.
18290,CANTO XXIV,And inasmuch as we must needs infer
18291,CANTO XXIV,"From such belief our reasoning, all respect"
18292,CANTO XXIV,"To other view excluded, hence of proof"
18293,CANTO XXIV,Th’ intention is deriv’d.” Forthwith I heard:
18294,CANTO XXIV,"“If thus, whate’er by learning men attain,"
18295,CANTO XXIV,"Were understood, the sophist would want room"
18296,CANTO XXIV,To exercise his wit.” So breath’d the flame
18297,CANTO XXIV,Of love: then added: “Current is the coin
18298,CANTO XXIV,"Thou utter’st, both in weight and in alloy."
18299,CANTO XXIV,"But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.”"
18300,CANTO XXIV,
18301,CANTO XXIV,"“Even so glittering and so round,” said I,"
18302,CANTO XXIV,“I not a whit misdoubt of its assay.”
18303,CANTO XXIV,
18304,CANTO XXIV,Next issued from the deep imbosom’d splendour:
18305,CANTO XXIV,"“Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which"
18306,CANTO XXIV,"Is founded every virtue, came to thee.”"
18307,CANTO XXIV,"“The flood,” I answer’d, “from the Spirit of God"
18308,CANTO XXIV,"Rain’d down upon the ancient bond and new,—"
18309,CANTO XXIV,"Here is the reas’ning, that convinceth me"
18310,CANTO XXIV,"So feelingly, each argument beside"
18311,CANTO XXIV,Seems blunt and forceless in comparison.”
18312,CANTO XXIV,"Then heard I: “Wherefore holdest thou that each,"
18313,CANTO XXIV,"The elder proposition and the new,"
18314,CANTO XXIV,"Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav’n?”"
18315,CANTO XXIV,
18316,CANTO XXIV,"“The works, that follow’d, evidence their truth; “"
18317,CANTO XXIV,I answer’d: “Nature did not make for these
18318,CANTO XXIV,"The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.”"
18319,CANTO XXIV,"“Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,"
18320,CANTO XXIV,"Was the reply, “that they in very deed"
18321,CANTO XXIV,Are that they purport? None hath sworn so to thee.”
18322,CANTO XXIV,
18323,CANTO XXIV,"“That all the world,” said I, “should have bee turn’d"
18324,CANTO XXIV,"To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,"
18325,CANTO XXIV,"Would in itself be such a miracle,"
18326,CANTO XXIV,The rest were not an hundredth part so great.
18327,CANTO XXIV,E’en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger
18328,CANTO XXIV,"To set the goodly plant, that from the vine,"
18329,CANTO XXIV,"It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble.”"
18330,CANTO XXIV,"That ended, through the high celestial court"
18331,CANTO XXIV,Resounded all the spheres. “Praise we one God!”
18332,CANTO XXIV,In song of most unearthly melody.
18333,CANTO XXIV,"And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,"
18334,CANTO XXIV,"Examining, had led me, that we now"
18335,CANTO XXIV,"Approach’d the topmost bough, he straight resum’d;"
18336,CANTO XXIV,"“The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,"
18337,CANTO XXIV,So far discreetly hath thy lips unclos’d
18338,CANTO XXIV,"That, whatsoe’er has past them, I commend."
18339,CANTO XXIV,"Behooves thee to express, what thou believ’st,"
18340,CANTO XXIV,"The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown.”"
18341,CANTO XXIV,
18342,CANTO XXIV,"“O saintly sire and spirit!” I began,"
18343,CANTO XXIV,"“Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,"
18344,CANTO XXIV,"As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,"
18345,CANTO XXIV,"Toward the sepulchre? thy will is here,"
18346,CANTO XXIV,That I the tenour of my creed unfold;
18347,CANTO XXIV,And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask’d.
18348,CANTO XXIV,"And I reply: I in one God believe,"
18349,CANTO XXIV,"One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love"
18350,CANTO XXIV,"All heav’n is mov’d, himself unmov’d the while."
18351,CANTO XXIV,"Nor demonstration physical alone,"
18352,CANTO XXIV,"Or more intelligential and abstruse,"
18353,CANTO XXIV,Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth
18354,CANTO XXIV,"It cometh to me rather, which is shed"
18355,CANTO XXIV,"Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms."
18356,CANTO XXIV,"The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,"
18357,CANTO XXIV,When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.
18358,CANTO XXIV,"In three eternal Persons I believe,"
18359,CANTO XXIV,"Essence threefold and one, mysterious league"
18360,CANTO XXIV,"Of union absolute, which, many a time,"
18361,CANTO XXIV,The word of gospel lore upon my mind
18362,CANTO XXIV,"Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,"
18363,CANTO XXIV,"The lively flame dilates, and like heav’n’s star"
18364,CANTO XXIV,"Doth glitter in me.” As the master hears,"
18365,CANTO XXIV,"Well pleas’d, and then enfoldeth in his arms"
18366,CANTO XXIV,"The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,"
18367,CANTO XXIV,And having told the errand keeps his peace;
18368,CANTO XXIV,Thus benediction uttering with song
18369,CANTO XXIV,"Soon as my peace I held, compass’d me thrice"
18370,CANTO XXIV,"The apostolic radiance, whose behest"
18371,CANTO XXIV,Had op’d lips; so well their answer pleas’d.
18372,CANTO XXIV,
18373,CANTO XXIV,
18374,CANTO XXIV,
18375,CANTO XXIV,
18376,CANTO XXV,CANTO XXV
18377,CANTO XXV,
18378,CANTO XXV,
18379,CANTO XXV,If e’er the sacred poem that hath made
18380,CANTO XXV,"Both heav’n and earth copartners in its toil,"
18381,CANTO XXV,"And with lean abstinence, through many a year,"
18382,CANTO XXV,"Faded my brow, be destin’d to prevail"
18383,CANTO XXV,"Over the cruelty, which bars me forth"
18384,CANTO XXV,"Of the fair sheep-fold, where a sleeping lamb"
18385,CANTO XXV,"The wolves set on and fain had worried me,"
18386,CANTO XXV,With other voice and fleece of other grain
18387,CANTO XXV,"I shall forthwith return, and, standing up"
18388,CANTO XXV,"At my baptismal font, shall claim the wreath"
18389,CANTO XXV,Due to the poet’s temples: for I there
18390,CANTO XXV,First enter’d on the faith which maketh souls
18391,CANTO XXV,"Acceptable to God: and, for its sake,"
18392,CANTO XXV,Peter had then circled my forehead thus.
18393,CANTO XXV,
18394,CANTO XXV,"Next from the squadron, whence had issued forth"
18395,CANTO XXV,"The first fruit of Christ’s vicars on the earth,"
18396,CANTO XXV,"Toward us mov’d a light, at view whereof"
18397,CANTO XXV,"My Lady, full of gladness, spake to me:"
18398,CANTO XXV,"“Lo! lo! behold the peer of mickle might,"
18399,CANTO XXV,That makes Falicia throng’d with visitants!”
18400,CANTO XXV,
18401,CANTO XXV,"As when the ring-dove by his mate alights,"
18402,CANTO XXV,"In circles each about the other wheels,"
18403,CANTO XXV,And murmuring cooes his fondness; thus saw I
18404,CANTO XXV,"One, of the other great and glorious prince,"
18405,CANTO XXV,"With kindly greeting hail’d, extolling both"
18406,CANTO XXV,Their heavenly banqueting; but when an end
18407,CANTO XXV,"Was to their gratulation, silent, each,"
18408,CANTO XXV,"Before me sat they down, so burning bright,"
18409,CANTO XXV,"I could not look upon them. Smiling then,"
18410,CANTO XXV,Beatrice spake: “O life in glory shrin’d!”
18411,CANTO XXV,Who didst the largess of our kingly court
18412,CANTO XXV,Set down with faithful pen! let now thy voice
18413,CANTO XXV,Of hope the praises in this height resound.
18414,CANTO XXV,"For thou, who figur’st them in shapes, as clear,"
18415,CANTO XXV,"As Jesus stood before thee, well can’st speak them.”"
18416,CANTO XXV,
18417,CANTO XXV,"“Lift up thy head, and be thou strong in trust:"
18418,CANTO XXV,"For that, which hither from the mortal world"
18419,CANTO XXV,"Arriveth, must be ripen’d in our beam.”"
18420,CANTO XXV,
18421,CANTO XXV,Such cheering accents from the second flame
18422,CANTO XXV,Assur’d me; and mine eyes I lifted up
18423,CANTO XXV,Unto the mountains that had bow’d them late
18424,CANTO XXV,With over-heavy burden. “Sith our Liege
18425,CANTO XXV,"Wills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,"
18426,CANTO XXV,"In the most secret council, with his lords"
18427,CANTO XXV,"Shouldst be confronted, so that having view’d"
18428,CANTO XXV,"The glories of our court, thou mayst therewith"
18429,CANTO XXV,"Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate"
18430,CANTO XXV,"With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,"
18431,CANTO XXV,"What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,"
18432,CANTO XXV,"And whence thou hadst it?” Thus proceeding still,"
18433,CANTO XXV,"The second light: and she, whose gentle love"
18434,CANTO XXV,My soaring pennons in that lofty flight
18435,CANTO XXV,"Escorted, thus preventing me, rejoin’d:"
18436,CANTO XXV,"Among her sons, not one more full of hope,"
18437,CANTO XXV,Hath the church militant: so ’tis of him
18438,CANTO XXV,"Recorded in the sun, whose liberal orb"
18439,CANTO XXV,Enlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term
18440,CANTO XXV,"Of warfare, hence permitted he is come,"
18441,CANTO XXV,"From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see."
18442,CANTO XXV,"The other points, both which thou hast inquir’d,"
18443,CANTO XXV,"Not for more knowledge, but that he may tell"
18444,CANTO XXV,"How dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him"
18445,CANTO XXV,"Leave I; for he may answer thee with ease,"
18446,CANTO XXV,"And without boasting, so God give him grace.”"
18447,CANTO XXV,"Like to the scholar, practis’d in his task,"
18448,CANTO XXV,"Who, willing to give proof of diligence,"
18449,CANTO XXV,"Seconds his teacher gladly, “Hope,” said I,"
18450,CANTO XXV,"“Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,"
18451,CANTO XXV,Th’ effect of grace divine and merit preceding.
18452,CANTO XXV,"This light from many a star visits my heart,"
18453,CANTO XXV,"But flow’d to me the first from him, who sang"
18454,CANTO XXV,"The songs of the Supreme, himself supreme"
18455,CANTO XXV,Among his tuneful brethren. ‘Let all hope
18456,CANTO XXV,"In thee,’ so speak his anthem, ‘who have known"
18457,CANTO XXV,Thy name;’ and with my faith who know not that?
18458,CANTO XXV,"From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,"
18459,CANTO XXV,"In thine epistle, fell on me the drops"
18460,CANTO XXV,"So plenteously, that I on others shower"
18461,CANTO XXV,"The influence of their dew.” Whileas I spake,"
18462,CANTO XXV,"A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,"
18463,CANTO XXV,"Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,"
18464,CANTO XXV,Play’d tremulous; then forth these accents breath’d:
18465,CANTO XXV,“Love for the virtue which attended me
18466,CANTO XXV,"E’en to the palm, and issuing from the field,"
18467,CANTO XXV,"Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspires"
18468,CANTO XXV,"To ask of thee, whom also it delights;"
18469,CANTO XXV,What promise thou from hope in chief dost win.”
18470,CANTO XXV,
18471,CANTO XXV,"“Both scriptures, new and ancient,” I reply’d;"
18472,CANTO XXV,“Propose the mark (which even now I view)
18473,CANTO XXV,"For souls belov’d of God. Isaias saith,"
18474,CANTO XXV,
18475,CANTO XXV,"That, in their own land, each one must be clad"
18476,CANTO XXV,In twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.
18477,CANTO XXV,"In terms more full,"
18478,CANTO XXV,"And clearer far, thy brother hath set forth"
18479,CANTO XXV,"This revelation to us, where he tells"
18480,CANTO XXV,Of the white raiment destin’d to the saints.”
18481,CANTO XXV,"And, as the words were ending, from above,"
18482,CANTO XXV,"“They hope in thee,” first heard we cried: whereto"
18483,CANTO XXV,"Answer’d the carols all. Amidst them next,"
18484,CANTO XXV,"A light of so clear amplitude emerg’d,"
18485,CANTO XXV,"That winter’s month were but a single day,"
18486,CANTO XXV,Were such a crystal in the Cancer’s sign.
18487,CANTO XXV,
18488,CANTO XXV,"Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,"
18489,CANTO XXV,"And enters on the mazes of the dance,"
18490,CANTO XXV,"Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,"
18491,CANTO XXV,Than to do fitting honour to the bride;
18492,CANTO XXV,So I beheld the new effulgence come
18493,CANTO XXV,"Unto the other two, who in a ring"
18494,CANTO XXV,"Wheel’d, as became their rapture. In the dance"
18495,CANTO XXV,And in the song it mingled. And the dame
18496,CANTO XXV,Held on them fix’d her looks: e’en as the spouse
18497,CANTO XXV,"Silent and moveless. “This is he, who lay"
18498,CANTO XXV,Upon the bosom of our pelican:
18499,CANTO XXV,"This he, into whose keeping from the cross"
18500,CANTO XXV,"The mighty charge was given.” Thus she spake,"
18501,CANTO XXV,Yet therefore naught the more remov’d her Sight
18502,CANTO XXV,"From marking them, or ere her words began,"
18503,CANTO XXV,"Or when they clos’d. As he, who looks intent,"
18504,CANTO XXV,"And strives with searching ken, how he may see"
18505,CANTO XXV,"The sun in his eclipse, and, through desire"
18506,CANTO XXV,"Of seeing, loseth power of sight: so I"
18507,CANTO XXV,"Peer’d on that last resplendence, while I heard:"
18508,CANTO XXV,"“Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,"
18509,CANTO XXV,"Which here abides not? Earth my body is,"
18510,CANTO XXV,"In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,"
18511,CANTO XXV,As till our number equal the decree
18512,CANTO XXV,"Of the Most High. The two that have ascended,"
18513,CANTO XXV,"In this our blessed cloister, shine alone"
18514,CANTO XXV,With the two garments. So report below.”
18515,CANTO XXV,
18516,CANTO XXV,"As when, for ease of labour, or to shun"
18517,CANTO XXV,"Suspected peril at a whistle’s breath,"
18518,CANTO XXV,"The oars, erewhile dash’d frequent in the wave,"
18519,CANTO XXV,All rest; the flamy circle at that voice
18520,CANTO XXV,"So rested, and the mingling sound was still,"
18521,CANTO XXV,Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.
18522,CANTO XXV,"I turn’d, but ah! how trembled in my thought,"
18523,CANTO XXV,"When, looking at my side again to see"
18524,CANTO XXV,"Beatrice, I descried her not, although"
18525,CANTO XXV,"Not distant, on the happy coast she stood."
18526,CANTO XXV,
18527,CANTO XXV,
18528,CANTO XXV,
18529,CANTO XXV,
18530,CANTO XXVI,CANTO XXVI
18531,CANTO XXVI,
18532,CANTO XXVI,
18533,CANTO XXVI,"With dazzled eyes, whilst wond’ring I remain’d,"
18534,CANTO XXVI,"Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,"
18535,CANTO XXVI,"Issued a breath, that in attention mute"
18536,CANTO XXVI,"Detain’d me; and these words it spake: “’Twere well,"
18537,CANTO XXVI,"That, long as till thy vision, on my form"
18538,CANTO XXVI,"O’erspent, regain its virtue, with discourse"
18539,CANTO XXVI,"Thou compensate the brief delay. Say then,"
18540,CANTO XXVI,"Beginning, to what point thy soul aspires:"
18541,CANTO XXVI,"And meanwhile rest assur’d, that sight in thee"
18542,CANTO XXVI,"Is but o’erpowered a space, not wholly quench’d:"
18543,CANTO XXVI,"Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her look"
18544,CANTO XXVI,"Hath potency, the like to that which dwelt"
18545,CANTO XXVI,In Ananias’ hand.” I answering thus:
18546,CANTO XXVI,“Be to mine eyes the remedy or late
18547,CANTO XXVI,"Or early, at her pleasure; for they were"
18548,CANTO XXVI,"The gates, at which she enter’d, and did light"
18549,CANTO XXVI,Her never dying fire. My wishes here
18550,CANTO XXVI,"Are centered; in this palace is the weal,"
18551,CANTO XXVI,"That Alpha and Omega, is to all"
18552,CANTO XXVI,The lessons love can read me.” Yet again
18553,CANTO XXVI,"The voice which had dispers’d my fear, when daz’d"
18554,CANTO XXVI,"With that excess, to converse urg’d, and spake:"
18555,CANTO XXVI,"“Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,"
18556,CANTO XXVI,"And say, who level’d at this scope thy bow.”"
18557,CANTO XXVI,
18558,CANTO XXVI,"“Philosophy,” said I, “hath arguments,"
18559,CANTO XXVI,And this place hath authority enough
18560,CANTO XXVI,"’T’ imprint in me such love: for, of constraint,"
18561,CANTO XXVI,"Good, inasmuch as we perceive the good,"
18562,CANTO XXVI,"Kindles our love, and in degree the more,"
18563,CANTO XXVI,As it comprises more of goodness in ’t.
18564,CANTO XXVI,"The essence then, where such advantage is,"
18565,CANTO XXVI,"That each good, found without it, is naught else"
18566,CANTO XXVI,"But of his light the beam, must needs attract"
18567,CANTO XXVI,"The soul of each one, loving, who the truth"
18568,CANTO XXVI,"Discerns, on which this proof is built. Such truth"
18569,CANTO XXVI,"Learn I from him, who shows me the first love"
18570,CANTO XXVI,Of all intelligential substances
18571,CANTO XXVI,"Eternal: from his voice I learn, whose word"
18572,CANTO XXVI,"Is truth, that of himself to Moses saith,"
18573,CANTO XXVI,‘I will make all my good before thee pass.’
18574,CANTO XXVI,"Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim’st,"
18575,CANTO XXVI,"E’en at the outset of thy heralding,"
18576,CANTO XXVI,In mortal ears the mystery of heav’n.”
18577,CANTO XXVI,
18578,CANTO XXVI,"“Through human wisdom, and th’ authority"
18579,CANTO XXVI,"Therewith agreeing,” heard I answer’d, “keep"
18580,CANTO XXVI,"The choicest of thy love for God. But say,"
18581,CANTO XXVI,If thou yet other cords within thee feel’st
18582,CANTO XXVI,That draw thee towards him; so that thou report
18583,CANTO XXVI,"How many are the fangs, with which this love"
18584,CANTO XXVI,"Is grappled to thy soul.” I did not miss,"
18585,CANTO XXVI,To what intent the eagle of our Lord
18586,CANTO XXVI,Had pointed his demand; yea noted well
18587,CANTO XXVI,"Th’ avowal, which he led to; and resum’d:"
18588,CANTO XXVI,"“All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,"
18589,CANTO XXVI,Confederate to make fast our clarity.
18590,CANTO XXVI,"The being of the world, and mine own being,"
18591,CANTO XXVI,"The death which he endur’d that I should live,"
18592,CANTO XXVI,"And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,"
18593,CANTO XXVI,"To the foremention’d lively knowledge join’d,"
18594,CANTO XXVI,"Have from the sea of ill love sav’d my bark,"
18595,CANTO XXVI,And on the coast secur’d it of the right.
18596,CANTO XXVI,"As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,"
18597,CANTO XXVI,"My love for them is great, as is the good"
18598,CANTO XXVI,"Dealt by th’ eternal hand, that tends them all.”"
18599,CANTO XXVI,
18600,CANTO XXVI,"I ended, and therewith a song most sweet"
18601,CANTO XXVI,"Rang through the spheres; and “Holy, holy, holy,”"
18602,CANTO XXVI,Accordant with the rest my lady sang.
18603,CANTO XXVI,And as a sleep is broken and dispers’d
18604,CANTO XXVI,"Through sharp encounter of the nimble light,"
18605,CANTO XXVI,With the eye’s spirit running forth to meet
18606,CANTO XXVI,"The ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg’d;"
18607,CANTO XXVI,And the upstartled wight loathes that be sees;
18608,CANTO XXVI,"So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems"
18609,CANTO XXVI,"Of all around him, till assurance waits"
18610,CANTO XXVI,On better judgment: thus the saintly came
18611,CANTO XXVI,"Drove from before mine eyes the motes away,"
18612,CANTO XXVI,"With the resplendence of her own, that cast"
18613,CANTO XXVI,"Their brightness downward, thousand miles below."
18614,CANTO XXVI,"Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,"
18615,CANTO XXVI,"Recover’d; and, well nigh astounded, ask’d"
18616,CANTO XXVI,"Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw."
18617,CANTO XXVI,
18618,CANTO XXVI,"And Beatrice: “The first diving soul,"
18619,CANTO XXVI,"That ever the first virtue fram’d, admires"
18620,CANTO XXVI,"Within these rays his Maker.” Like the leaf,"
18621,CANTO XXVI,That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;
18622,CANTO XXVI,By its own virtue rear’d then stands aloof;
18623,CANTO XXVI,"So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow’d."
18624,CANTO XXVI,Then eagerness to speak embolden’d me;
18625,CANTO XXVI,And I began: “O fruit! that wast alone
18626,CANTO XXVI,"Mature, when first engender’d! Ancient father!"
18627,CANTO XXVI,That doubly seest in every wedded bride
18628,CANTO XXVI,Thy daughter by affinity and blood!
18629,CANTO XXVI,"Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold"
18630,CANTO XXVI,"Converse with me: my will thou seest; and I,"
18631,CANTO XXVI,"More speedily to hear thee, tell it not “"
18632,CANTO XXVI,
18633,CANTO XXVI,"It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,"
18634,CANTO XXVI,Through the sleek cov’ring of his furry coat.
18635,CANTO XXVI,"The fondness, that stirs in him and conforms"
18636,CANTO XXVI,His outside seeming to the cheer within:
18637,CANTO XXVI,And in like guise was Adam’s spirit mov’d
18638,CANTO XXVI,"To joyous mood, that through the covering shone,"
18639,CANTO XXVI,"Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:"
18640,CANTO XXVI,"“No need thy will be told, which I untold"
18641,CANTO XXVI,"Better discern, than thou whatever thing"
18642,CANTO XXVI,Thou holdst most certain: for that will I see
18643,CANTO XXVI,"In Him, who is truth’s mirror, and Himself"
18644,CANTO XXVI,"Parhelion unto all things, and naught else"
18645,CANTO XXVI,To him. This wouldst thou hear; how long since God
18646,CANTO XXVI,"Plac’d me high garden, from whose hounds"
18647,CANTO XXVI,"She led me up in this ladder, steep and long;"
18648,CANTO XXVI,What space endur’d my season of delight;
18649,CANTO XXVI,Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish’d me;
18650,CANTO XXVI,"And what the language, which I spake and fram’d"
18651,CANTO XXVI,"Not that I tasted of the tree, my son,"
18652,CANTO XXVI,"Was in itself the cause of that exile,"
18653,CANTO XXVI,But only my transgressing of the mark
18654,CANTO XXVI,"Assign’d me. There, whence at thy lady’s hest"
18655,CANTO XXVI,"The Mantuan mov’d him, still was I debarr’d"
18656,CANTO XXVI,"This council, till the sun had made complete,"
18657,CANTO XXVI,"Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,"
18658,CANTO XXVI,"His annual journey; and, through every light"
18659,CANTO XXVI,"In his broad pathway, saw I him return,"
18660,CANTO XXVI,"Thousand save sev’nty times, the whilst I dwelt"
18661,CANTO XXVI,Upon the earth. The language I did use
18662,CANTO XXVI,"Was worn away, or ever Nimrod’s race"
18663,CANTO XXVI,Their unaccomplishable work began.
18664,CANTO XXVI,"For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,"
18665,CANTO XXVI,"Left by his reason free, and variable,"
18666,CANTO XXVI,"As is the sky that sways him. That he speaks,"
18667,CANTO XXVI,"Is nature’s prompting: whether thus or thus,"
18668,CANTO XXVI,"She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it."
18669,CANTO XXVI,"Ere I descended into hell’s abyss,"
18670,CANTO XXVI,"El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,"
18671,CANTO XXVI,Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then ’twas call’d
18672,CANTO XXVI,"And so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use"
18673,CANTO XXVI,"Is as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,"
18674,CANTO XXVI,And other comes instead. Upon the mount
18675,CANTO XXVI,"Most high above the waters, all my life,"
18676,CANTO XXVI,"Both innocent and guilty, did but reach"
18677,CANTO XXVI,"From the first hour, to that which cometh next"
18678,CANTO XXVI,"(As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth."
18679,CANTO XXVI,
18680,CANTO XXVI,
18681,CANTO XXVI,
18682,CANTO XXVI,
18683,CANTO XXVII,CANTO XXVII
18684,CANTO XXVII,
18685,CANTO XXVII,
18686,CANTO XXVII,"Then “Glory to the Father, to the Son,"
18687,CANTO XXVII,"And to the Holy Spirit,” rang aloud"
18688,CANTO XXVII,"Throughout all Paradise, that with the song"
18689,CANTO XXVII,"My spirit reel’d, so passing sweet the strain:"
18690,CANTO XXVII,And what I saw was equal ecstasy;
18691,CANTO XXVII,"One universal smile it seem’d of all things,"
18692,CANTO XXVII,"Joy past compare, gladness unutterable,"
18693,CANTO XXVII,"Imperishable life of peace and love,"
18694,CANTO XXVII,Exhaustless riches and unmeasur’d bliss.
18695,CANTO XXVII,
18696,CANTO XXVII,Before mine eyes stood the four torches lit;
18697,CANTO XXVII,"And that, which first had come, began to wax"
18698,CANTO XXVII,"In brightness, and in semblance such became,"
18699,CANTO XXVII,"As Jove might be, if he and Mars were birds,"
18700,CANTO XXVII,"And interchang’d their plumes. Silence ensued,"
18701,CANTO XXVII,"Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints"
18702,CANTO XXVII,"Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin’d;"
18703,CANTO XXVII,"When thus I heard: “Wonder not, if my hue"
18704,CANTO XXVII,"Be chang’d; for, while I speak, these shalt thou see"
18705,CANTO XXVII,All in like manner change with me. My place
18706,CANTO XXVII,"He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,"
18707,CANTO XXVII,Which in the presence of the Son of God
18708,CANTO XXVII,"Is void), the same hath made my cemetery"
18709,CANTO XXVII,A common sewer of puddle and of blood:
18710,CANTO XXVII,"The more below his triumph, who from hence"
18711,CANTO XXVII,"Malignant fell.” Such colour, as the sun,"
18712,CANTO XXVII,"At eve or morning, paints and adverse cloud,"
18713,CANTO XXVII,Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.
18714,CANTO XXVII,"And as th’ unblemish’d dame, who in herself"
18715,CANTO XXVII,"Secure of censure, yet at bare report"
18716,CANTO XXVII,"Of other’s failing, shrinks with maiden fear;"
18717,CANTO XXVII,So Beatrice in her semblance chang’d:
18718,CANTO XXVII,"And such eclipse in heav’n methinks was seen,"
18719,CANTO XXVII,When the Most Holy suffer’d. Then the words
18720,CANTO XXVII,"Proceeded, with voice, alter’d from itself"
18721,CANTO XXVII,"So clean, the semblance did not alter more."
18722,CANTO XXVII,"“Not to this end was Christ’s spouse with my blood,"
18723,CANTO XXVII,"With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:"
18724,CANTO XXVII,That she might serve for purchase of base gold:
18725,CANTO XXVII,But for the purchase of this happy life
18726,CANTO XXVII,"Did Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,"
18727,CANTO XXVII,"And Urban, they, whose doom was not without"
18728,CANTO XXVII,Much weeping seal’d. No purpose was of our
18729,CANTO XXVII,That on the right hand of our successors
18730,CANTO XXVII,"Part of the Christian people should be set,"
18731,CANTO XXVII,"And part upon their left; nor that the keys,"
18732,CANTO XXVII,"Which were vouchsaf’d me, should for ensign serve"
18733,CANTO XXVII,"Unto the banners, that do levy war"
18734,CANTO XXVII,"On the baptiz’d: nor I, for sigil-mark"
18735,CANTO XXVII,Set upon sold and lying privileges;
18736,CANTO XXVII,Which makes me oft to bicker and turn red.
18737,CANTO XXVII,In shepherd’s clothing greedy wolves below
18738,CANTO XXVII,Range wide o’er all the pastures. Arm of God!
18739,CANTO XXVII,Why longer sleepst thou? Caorsines and Gascona
18740,CANTO XXVII,Prepare to quaff our blood. O good beginning
18741,CANTO XXVII,To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!
18742,CANTO XXVII,"But the high providence, which did defend"
18743,CANTO XXVII,"Through Scipio the world’s glory unto Rome,"
18744,CANTO XXVII,"Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,"
18745,CANTO XXVII,Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again
18746,CANTO XXVII,"Return below, open thy lips, nor hide"
18747,CANTO XXVII,What is by me not hidden.” As a Hood
18748,CANTO XXVII,"Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,"
18749,CANTO XXVII,What time the she-goat with her skiey horn
18750,CANTO XXVII,Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide
18751,CANTO XXVII,"The vapours, who with us had linger’d late"
18752,CANTO XXVII,And with glad triumph deck th’ ethereal cope.
18753,CANTO XXVII,Onward my sight their semblances pursued;
18754,CANTO XXVII,"So far pursued, as till the space between"
18755,CANTO XXVII,From its reach sever’d them: whereat the guide
18756,CANTO XXVII,"Celestial, marking me no more intent"
18757,CANTO XXVII,"On upward gazing, said, “Look down and see"
18758,CANTO XXVII,What circuit thou hast compass’d.” From the hour
18759,CANTO XXVII,"When I before had cast my view beneath,"
18760,CANTO XXVII,"All the first region overpast I saw,"
18761,CANTO XXVII,Which from the midmost to the bound’ry winds;
18762,CANTO XXVII,That onward thence from Gades I beheld
18763,CANTO XXVII,"The unwise passage of Laertes’ son,"
18764,CANTO XXVII,"And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!"
18765,CANTO XXVII,Mad’st thee a joyful burden: and yet more
18766,CANTO XXVII,"Of this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,"
18767,CANTO XXVII,"A constellation off and more, had ta’en"
18768,CANTO XXVII,His progress in the zodiac underneath.
18769,CANTO XXVII,
18770,CANTO XXVII,"Then by the spirit, that doth never leave"
18771,CANTO XXVII,"Its amorous dalliance with my lady’s looks,"
18772,CANTO XXVII,Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes
18773,CANTO XXVII,"Led unto her: and from her radiant smiles,"
18774,CANTO XXVII,"Whenas I turn’d me, pleasure so divine"
18775,CANTO XXVII,"Did lighten on me, that whatever bait"
18776,CANTO XXVII,"Or art or nature in the human flesh,"
18777,CANTO XXVII,"Or in its limn’d resemblance, can combine"
18778,CANTO XXVII,"Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,"
18779,CANTO XXVII,Were to her beauty nothing. Its boon influence
18780,CANTO XXVII,"From the fair nest of Leda rapt me forth,"
18781,CANTO XXVII,And wafted on into the swiftest heav’n.
18782,CANTO XXVII,
18783,CANTO XXVII,"What place for entrance Beatrice chose,"
18784,CANTO XXVII,"I may not say, so uniform was all,"
18785,CANTO XXVII,Liveliest and loftiest. She my secret wish
18786,CANTO XXVII,"Divin’d; and with such gladness, that God’s love"
18787,CANTO XXVII,"Seem’d from her visage shining, thus began:"
18788,CANTO XXVII,"“Here is the goal, whence motion on his race"
18789,CANTO XXVII,"Starts; motionless the centre, and the rest"
18790,CANTO XXVII,"All mov’d around. Except the soul divine,"
18791,CANTO XXVII,"Place in this heav’n is none, the soul divine,"
18792,CANTO XXVII,"Wherein the love, which ruleth o’er its orb,"
18793,CANTO XXVII,"Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;"
18794,CANTO XXVII,"One circle, light and love, enclasping it,"
18795,CANTO XXVII,"As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,"
18796,CANTO XXVII,"Who draws the bound, its limit only known."
18797,CANTO XXVII,"Measur’d itself by none, it doth divide"
18798,CANTO XXVII,"Motion to all, counted unto them forth,"
18799,CANTO XXVII,As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.
18800,CANTO XXVII,"The vase, wherein time’s roots are plung’d, thou seest,"
18801,CANTO XXVII,Look elsewhere for the leaves. O mortal lust!
18802,CANTO XXVII,That canst not lift thy head above the waves
18803,CANTO XXVII,Which whelm and sink thee down! The will in man
18804,CANTO XXVII,Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise
18805,CANTO XXVII,"Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,"
18806,CANTO XXVII,Made mere abortion: faith and innocence
18807,CANTO XXVII,"Are met with but in babes, each taking leave"
18808,CANTO XXVII,"Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,"
18809,CANTO XXVII,"While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose"
18810,CANTO XXVII,Gluts every food alike in every moon.
18811,CANTO XXVII,"One yet a babbler, loves and listens to"
18812,CANTO XXVII,His mother; but no sooner hath free use
18813,CANTO XXVII,"Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave."
18814,CANTO XXVII,"So suddenly doth the fair child of him,"
18815,CANTO XXVII,"Whose welcome is the morn and eve his parting,"
18816,CANTO XXVII,To negro blackness change her virgin white.
18817,CANTO XXVII,
18818,CANTO XXVII,"“Thou, to abate thy wonder, note that none"
18819,CANTO XXVII,"Bears rule in earth, and its frail family"
18820,CANTO XXVII,"Are therefore wand’rers. Yet before the date,"
18821,CANTO XXVII,When through the hundredth in his reck’ning drops
18822,CANTO XXVII,Pale January must be shor’d aside
18823,CANTO XXVII,"From winter’s calendar, these heav’nly spheres"
18824,CANTO XXVII,"Shall roar so loud, that fortune shall be fain"
18825,CANTO XXVII,"To turn the poop, where she hath now the prow;"
18826,CANTO XXVII,"So that the fleet run onward; and true fruit,"
18827,CANTO XXVII,"Expected long, shall crown at last the bloom!”"

18832,CANTO XXVIII,CANTO XXVIII
18833,CANTO XXVIII,
18834,CANTO XXVIII,
18835,CANTO XXVIII,"So she who doth imparadise my soul,"
18836,CANTO XXVIII,"Had drawn the veil from off our pleasant life,"
18837,CANTO XXVIII,And bar’d the truth of poor mortality;
18838,CANTO XXVIII,"When lo! as one who, in a mirror, spies"
18839,CANTO XXVIII,"The shining of a flambeau at his back,"
18840,CANTO XXVIII,"Lit sudden ore he deem of its approach,"
18841,CANTO XXVIII,"And turneth to resolve him, if the glass"
18842,CANTO XXVIII,"Have told him true, and sees the record faithful"
18843,CANTO XXVIII,"As note is to its metre; even thus,"
18844,CANTO XXVIII,"I well remember, did befall to me,"
18845,CANTO XXVIII,"Looking upon the beauteous eyes, whence love"
18846,CANTO XXVIII,Had made the leash to take me. As I turn’d;
18847,CANTO XXVIII,"And that, which, in their circles, none who spies,"
18848,CANTO XXVIII,"Can miss of, in itself apparent, struck"
18849,CANTO XXVIII,"On mine; a point I saw, that darted light"
18850,CANTO XXVIII,"So sharp, no lid, unclosing, may bear up"
18851,CANTO XXVIII,Against its keenness. The least star we view
18852,CANTO XXVIII,"From hence, had seem’d a moon, set by its side,"
18853,CANTO XXVIII,"As star by side of star. And so far off,"
18854,CANTO XXVIII,"Perchance, as is the halo from the light"
18855,CANTO XXVIII,"Which paints it, when most dense the vapour spreads,"
18856,CANTO XXVIII,"There wheel’d about the point a circle of fire,"
18857,CANTO XXVIII,"More rapid than the motion, which first girds"
18858,CANTO XXVIII,"The world. Then, circle after circle, round"
18859,CANTO XXVIII,Enring’d each other; till the seventh reach’d
18860,CANTO XXVIII,"Circumference so ample, that its bow,"
18861,CANTO XXVIII,"Within the span of Juno’s messenger,"
18862,CANTO XXVIII,"lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev’nth,"
18863,CANTO XXVIII,"Follow’d yet other two. And every one,"
18864,CANTO XXVIII,"As more in number distant from the first,"
18865,CANTO XXVIII,Was tardier in motion; and that glow’d
18866,CANTO XXVIII,"With flame most pure, that to the sparkle’ of truth"
18867,CANTO XXVIII,"Was nearest, as partaking most, methinks,"
18868,CANTO XXVIII,Of its reality. The guide belov’d
18869,CANTO XXVIII,"Saw me in anxious thought suspense, and spake:"
18870,CANTO XXVIII,"“Heav’n, and all nature, hangs upon that point."
18871,CANTO XXVIII,The circle thereto most conjoin’d observe;
18872,CANTO XXVIII,"And know, that by intenser love its course"
18873,CANTO XXVIII,Is to this swiftness wing’d. “To whom I thus:
18874,CANTO XXVIII,"“It were enough; nor should I further seek,"
18875,CANTO XXVIII,"Had I but witness’d order, in the world"
18876,CANTO XXVIII,"Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen."
18877,CANTO XXVIII,"But in the sensible world such diff’rence is,"
18878,CANTO XXVIII,"That is each round shows more divinity,"
18879,CANTO XXVIII,"As each is wider from the centre. Hence,"
18880,CANTO XXVIII,"If in this wondrous and angelic temple,"
18881,CANTO XXVIII,"That hath for confine only light and love,"
18882,CANTO XXVIII,"My wish may have completion I must know,"
18883,CANTO XXVIII,Wherefore such disagreement is between
18884,CANTO XXVIII,"Th’ exemplar and its copy: for myself,"
18885,CANTO XXVIII,"Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.”"
18886,CANTO XXVIII,
18887,CANTO XXVIII,"“It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil’d"
18888,CANTO XXVIII,Do leave the knot untied: so hard ’tis grown
18889,CANTO XXVIII,"For want of tenting.” Thus she said: “But take,”"
18890,CANTO XXVIII,"She added, “if thou wish thy cure, my words,"
18891,CANTO XXVIII,And entertain them subtly. Every orb
18892,CANTO XXVIII,"Corporeal, doth proportion its extent"
18893,CANTO XXVIII,Unto the virtue through its parts diffus’d.
18894,CANTO XXVIII,The greater blessedness preserves the more.
18895,CANTO XXVIII,The greater is the body (if all parts
18896,CANTO XXVIII,Share equally) the more is to preserve.
18897,CANTO XXVIII,"Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheels"
18898,CANTO XXVIII,"The universal frame answers to that,"
18899,CANTO XXVIII,Which is supreme in knowledge and in love
18900,CANTO XXVIII,"Thus by the virtue, not the seeming, breadth"
18901,CANTO XXVIII,"Of substance, measure, thou shalt see the heav’ns,"
18902,CANTO XXVIII,"Each to the’ intelligence that ruleth it,"
18903,CANTO XXVIII,"Greater to more, and smaller unto less,"
18904,CANTO XXVIII,Suited in strict and wondrous harmony.”
18905,CANTO XXVIII,
18906,CANTO XXVIII,As when the sturdy north blows from his cheek
18907,CANTO XXVIII,"A blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air,"
18908,CANTO XXVIII,"Clear’d of the rack, that hung on it before,"
18909,CANTO XXVIII,"Glitters; and, With his beauties all unveil’d,"
18910,CANTO XXVIII,"The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles;"
18911,CANTO XXVIII,"Such was my cheer, when Beatrice drove"
18912,CANTO XXVIII,"With clear reply the shadows back, and truth"
18913,CANTO XXVIII,"Was manifested, as a star in heaven."
18914,CANTO XXVIII,"And when the words were ended, not unlike"
18915,CANTO XXVIII,"To iron in the furnace, every cirque"
18916,CANTO XXVIII,Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires:
18917,CANTO XXVIII,"And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,"
18918,CANTO XXVIII,In number did outmillion the account
18919,CANTO XXVIII,Reduplicate upon the chequer’d board.
18920,CANTO XXVIII,"Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,"
18921,CANTO XXVIII,"“Hosanna,” to the fixed point, that holds,"
18922,CANTO XXVIII,"And shall for ever hold them to their place,"
18923,CANTO XXVIII,"From everlasting, irremovable."
18924,CANTO XXVIII,
18925,CANTO XXVIII,"Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw"
18926,CANTO XXVIII,"by inward meditations, thus began:"
18927,CANTO XXVIII,"“In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,"
18928,CANTO XXVIII,Are seraphim and cherubim. Thus swift
18929,CANTO XXVIII,"Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,"
18930,CANTO XXVIII,"Near as they can, approaching; and they can"
18931,CANTO XXVIII,"The more, the loftier their vision. Those,"
18932,CANTO XXVIII,"That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,"
18933,CANTO XXVIII,Are thrones; in whom the first trine ends. And all
18934,CANTO XXVIII,"Are blessed, even as their sight descends"
18935,CANTO XXVIII,"Deeper into the truth, wherein rest is"
18936,CANTO XXVIII,For every mind. Thus happiness hath root
18937,CANTO XXVIII,"In seeing, not in loving, which of sight"
18938,CANTO XXVIII,Is aftergrowth. And of the seeing such
18939,CANTO XXVIII,"The meed, as unto each in due degree"
18940,CANTO XXVIII,Grace and good-will their measure have assign’d.
18941,CANTO XXVIII,"The other trine, that with still opening buds"
18942,CANTO XXVIII,"In this eternal springtide blossom fair,"
18943,CANTO XXVIII,"Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,"
18944,CANTO XXVIII,Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold
18945,CANTO XXVIII,"Hosannas blending ever, from the three"
18946,CANTO XXVIII,"Transmitted. hierarchy of gods, for aye"
18947,CANTO XXVIII,"Rejoicing, dominations first, next then"
18948,CANTO XXVIII,"Virtues, and powers the third. The next to whom"
18949,CANTO XXVIII,"Are princedoms and archangels, with glad round"
18950,CANTO XXVIII,To tread their festal ring; and last the band
18951,CANTO XXVIII,"Angelical, disporting in their sphere."
18952,CANTO XXVIII,"All, as they circle in their orders, look"
18953,CANTO XXVIII,"Aloft, and downward with such sway prevail,"
18954,CANTO XXVIII,That all with mutual impulse tend to God.
18955,CANTO XXVIII,These once a mortal view beheld. Desire
18956,CANTO XXVIII,"In Dionysius so intently wrought,"
18957,CANTO XXVIII,"That he, as I have done rang’d them; and nam’d"
18958,CANTO XXVIII,"Their orders, marshal’d in his thought. From him"
18959,CANTO XXVIII,"Dissentient, one refus’d his sacred read."
18960,CANTO XXVIII,But soon as in this heav’n his doubting eyes
18961,CANTO XXVIII,"Were open’d, Gregory at his error smil’d"
18962,CANTO XXVIII,"Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth"
18963,CANTO XXVIII,Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt
18964,CANTO XXVIII,"Both this and much beside of these our orbs,"
18965,CANTO XXVIII,From an eye-witness to heav’n’s mysteries.”

18971,CANTO XXIX,
18972,CANTO XXIX,
18973,CANTO XXIX,No longer than what time Latona’s twins
18974,CANTO XXIX,"Cover’d of Libra and the fleecy star,"
18975,CANTO XXIX,"Together both, girding the’ horizon hang,"
18976,CANTO XXIX,"In even balance from the zenith pois’d,"
18977,CANTO XXIX,"Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,"
18978,CANTO XXIX,Part the nice level; e’en so brief a space
18979,CANTO XXIX,Did Beatrice’s silence hold. A smile
18980,CANTO XXIX,Bat painted on her cheek; and her fix’d gaze
18981,CANTO XXIX,"Bent on the point, at which my vision fail’d:"
18982,CANTO XXIX,When thus her words resuming she began:
18983,CANTO XXIX,"“I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;"
18984,CANTO XXIX,"For I have mark’d it, where all time and place"
18985,CANTO XXIX,Are present. Not for increase to himself
18986,CANTO XXIX,"Of good, which may not be increas’d, but forth"
18987,CANTO XXIX,"To manifest his glory by its beams,"
18988,CANTO XXIX,"Inhabiting his own eternity,"
18989,CANTO XXIX,Beyond time’s limit or what bound soe’er
18990,CANTO XXIX,"To circumscribe his being, as he will’d,"
18991,CANTO XXIX,"Into new natures, like unto himself,"
18992,CANTO XXIX,"Eternal Love unfolded. Nor before,"
18993,CANTO XXIX,As if in dull inaction torpid lay.
18994,CANTO XXIX,For not in process of before or aft
18995,CANTO XXIX,Upon these waters mov’d the Spirit of God.
18996,CANTO XXIX,"Simple and mix’d, both form and substance, forth"
18997,CANTO XXIX,"To perfect being started, like three darts"
18998,CANTO XXIX,Shot from a bow three-corded. And as ray
18999,CANTO XXIX,"In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,"
19000,CANTO XXIX,E’en at the moment of its issuing; thus
19001,CANTO XXIX,"Did, from th’ eternal Sovran, beam entire"
19002,CANTO XXIX,"His threefold operation, at one act"
19003,CANTO XXIX,Produc’d coeval. Yet in order each
19004,CANTO XXIX,"Created his due station knew: those highest,"
19005,CANTO XXIX,Who pure intelligence were made: mere power
19006,CANTO XXIX,"The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,"
19007,CANTO XXIX,"Intelligence and power, unsever’d bond."
19008,CANTO XXIX,"Long tract of ages by the angels past,"
19009,CANTO XXIX,"Ere the creating of another world,"
19010,CANTO XXIX,Describ’d on Jerome’s pages thou hast seen.
19011,CANTO XXIX,"But that what I disclose to thee is true,"
19012,CANTO XXIX,"Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov’d"
19013,CANTO XXIX,In many a passage of their sacred book
19014,CANTO XXIX,Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find
19015,CANTO XXIX,"And reason in some sort discerns the same,"
19016,CANTO XXIX,Who scarce would grant the heav’nly ministers
19017,CANTO XXIX,"Of their perfection void, so long a space."
19018,CANTO XXIX,"Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,"
19019,CANTO XXIX,"Thou know’st, and how: and knowing hast allay’d"
19020,CANTO XXIX,"Thy thirst, which from the triple question rose."
19021,CANTO XXIX,"Ere one had reckon’d twenty, e’en so soon"
19022,CANTO XXIX,Part of the angels fell: and in their fall
19023,CANTO XXIX,Confusion to your elements ensued.
19024,CANTO XXIX,"The others kept their station: and this task,"
19025,CANTO XXIX,"Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,"
19026,CANTO XXIX,"That they surcease not ever, day nor night,"
19027,CANTO XXIX,Their circling. Of that fatal lapse the cause
19028,CANTO XXIX,"Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen"
19029,CANTO XXIX,"Pent with the world’s incumbrance. Those, whom here"
19030,CANTO XXIX,"Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves"
19031,CANTO XXIX,"Of his free bounty, who had made them apt"
19032,CANTO XXIX,For ministries so high: therefore their views
19033,CANTO XXIX,Were by enlight’ning grace and their own merit
19034,CANTO XXIX,Exalted; so that in their will confirm’d
19035,CANTO XXIX,"They stand, nor feel to fall. For do not doubt,"
19036,CANTO XXIX,"But to receive the grace, which heav’n vouchsafes,"
19037,CANTO XXIX,"Is meritorious, even as the soul"
19038,CANTO XXIX,With prompt affection welcometh the guest.
19039,CANTO XXIX,"Now, without further help, if with good heed"
19040,CANTO XXIX,"My words thy mind have treasur’d, thou henceforth"
19041,CANTO XXIX,"This consistory round about mayst scan,"
19042,CANTO XXIX,And gaze thy fill. But since thou hast on earth
19043,CANTO XXIX,"Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,"
19044,CANTO XXIX,"Canvas the’ angelic nature, and dispute"
19045,CANTO XXIX,"Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;"
19046,CANTO XXIX,"Therefore, ’tis well thou take from me the truth,"
19047,CANTO XXIX,"Pure and without disguise, which they below,"
19048,CANTO XXIX,"Equivocating, darken and perplex."
19049,CANTO XXIX,
19050,CANTO XXIX,"“Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,"
19051,CANTO XXIX,"Rejoicing in the countenance of God,"
19052,CANTO XXIX,"Have held unceasingly their view, intent"
19053,CANTO XXIX,"Upon the glorious vision, from the which"
19054,CANTO XXIX,Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change
19055,CANTO XXIX,"Of newness with succession interrupts,"
19056,CANTO XXIX,Remembrance there needs none to gather up
19057,CANTO XXIX,Divided thought and images remote
19058,CANTO XXIX,
19059,CANTO XXIX,"“So that men, thus at variance with the truth"
19060,CANTO XXIX,"Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some"
19061,CANTO XXIX,"Of error; others well aware they err,"
19062,CANTO XXIX,To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.
19063,CANTO XXIX,Each the known track of sage philosophy
19064,CANTO XXIX,"Deserts, and has a byway of his own:"
19065,CANTO XXIX,So much the restless eagerness to shine
19066,CANTO XXIX,And love of singularity prevail.
19067,CANTO XXIX,"Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes"
19068,CANTO XXIX,"Heav’n’s anger less, than when the book of God"
19069,CANTO XXIX,"Is forc’d to yield to man’s authority,"
19070,CANTO XXIX,Or from its straightness warp’d: no reck’ning made
19071,CANTO XXIX,What blood the sowing of it in the world
19072,CANTO XXIX,"Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,"
19073,CANTO XXIX,Who meekly clings to it. The aim of all
19074,CANTO XXIX,"Is how to shine: e’en they, whose office is"
19075,CANTO XXIX,"To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,"
19076,CANTO XXIX,And pass their own inventions off instead.
19077,CANTO XXIX,"One tells, how at Christ’s suffering the wan moon"
19078,CANTO XXIX,"Bent back her steps, and shadow’d o’er the sun"
19079,CANTO XXIX,"With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:"
19080,CANTO XXIX,"Another, how the light shrouded itself"
19081,CANTO XXIX,"Within its tabernacle, and left dark"
19082,CANTO XXIX,"The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew."
19083,CANTO XXIX,"Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,"
19084,CANTO XXIX,"Bandied about more frequent, than the names"
19085,CANTO XXIX,Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.
19086,CANTO XXIX,"The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return"
19087,CANTO XXIX,"From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails"
19088,CANTO XXIX,"For their excuse, they do not see their harm?"
19089,CANTO XXIX,"Christ said not to his first conventicle,"
19090,CANTO XXIX,"‘Go forth and preach impostures to the world,’"
19091,CANTO XXIX,But gave them truth to build on; and the sound
19092,CANTO XXIX,"Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,"
19093,CANTO XXIX,"Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,"
19094,CANTO XXIX,To aid them in their warfare for the faith.
19095,CANTO XXIX,The preacher now provides himself with store
19096,CANTO XXIX,"Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack"
19097,CANTO XXIX,"Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl"
19098,CANTO XXIX,"Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:"
19099,CANTO XXIX,Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while
19100,CANTO XXIX,"Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,"
19101,CANTO XXIX,They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.
19102,CANTO XXIX,"Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,"
19103,CANTO XXIX,"That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad"
19104,CANTO XXIX,"The hands of holy promise, finds a throng"
19105,CANTO XXIX,Of credulous fools beneath. Saint Anthony
19106,CANTO XXIX,"Fattens with this his swine, and others worse"
19107,CANTO XXIX,"Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,"
19108,CANTO XXIX,Paying with unstamp’d metal for their fare.

19174,CANTO XXX,"Into the heav’n, that is unbodied light,"
19175,CANTO XXX,"Light intellectual replete with love,"
19176,CANTO XXX,"Love of true happiness replete with joy,"
19177,CANTO XXX,"Joy, that transcends all sweetness of delight."
19178,CANTO XXX,Here shalt thou look on either mighty host
19179,CANTO XXX,"Of Paradise; and one in that array,"
19180,CANTO XXX,Which in the final judgment thou shalt see.”
19181,CANTO XXX,
19182,CANTO XXX,"As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen"
19183,CANTO XXX,"Unfolded, dashes from the blinding eyes"
19184,CANTO XXX,The visive spirits dazzled and bedimm’d;
19185,CANTO XXX,"So, round about me, fulminating streams"
19186,CANTO XXX,"Of living radiance play’d, and left me swath’d"
19187,CANTO XXX,And veil’d in dense impenetrable blaze.
19188,CANTO XXX,"Such weal is in the love, that stills this heav’n;"
19189,CANTO XXX,For its own flame the torch this fitting ever!
19190,CANTO XXX,
19191,CANTO XXX,No sooner to my list’ning ear had come
19192,CANTO XXX,"The brief assurance, than I understood"
19193,CANTO XXX,"New virtue into me infus’d, and sight"
19194,CANTO XXX,"Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain"
19195,CANTO XXX,"Excess of light, however pure. I look’d;"
19196,CANTO XXX,And in the likeness of a river saw
19197,CANTO XXX,"Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves"
19198,CANTO XXX,"Flash’d up effulgence, as they glided on"
19199,CANTO XXX,"’Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,"
19200,CANTO XXX,"Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,"
19201,CANTO XXX,"There ever and anon, outstarting, flew"
19202,CANTO XXX,Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow’rs
19203,CANTO XXX,"Did set them, like to rubies chas’d in gold;"
19204,CANTO XXX,"Then, as if drunk with odors, plung’d again"
19205,CANTO XXX,"Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one"
19206,CANTO XXX,"Re’enter’d, still another rose. “The thirst"
19207,CANTO XXX,"Of knowledge high, whereby thou art inflam’d,"
19208,CANTO XXX,"To search the meaning of what here thou seest,"
19209,CANTO XXX,"The more it warms thee, pleases me the more."
19210,CANTO XXX,"But first behooves thee of this water drink,"
19211,CANTO XXX,Or ere that longing be allay’d.” So spake
19212,CANTO XXX,The day-star of mine eyes; then thus subjoin’d:
19213,CANTO XXX,"“This stream, and these, forth issuing from its gulf,"
19214,CANTO XXX,"And diving back, a living topaz each,"
19215,CANTO XXX,"With all this laughter on its bloomy shores,"
19216,CANTO XXX,"Are but a preface, shadowy of the truth"
19217,CANTO XXX,"They emblem: not that, in themselves, the things"
19218,CANTO XXX,"Are crude; but on thy part is the defect,"
19219,CANTO XXX,For that thy views not yet aspire so high.”
19220,CANTO XXX,"Never did babe, that had outslept his wont,"
19221,CANTO XXX,"Rush, with such eager straining, to the milk,"
19222,CANTO XXX,"As I toward the water, bending me,"
19223,CANTO XXX,To make the better mirrors of mine eyes
19224,CANTO XXX,"In the refining wave; and, as the eaves"
19225,CANTO XXX,"Of mine eyelids did drink of it, forthwith"
19226,CANTO XXX,"Seem’d it unto me turn’d from length to round,"
19227,CANTO XXX,"Then as a troop of maskers, when they put"
19228,CANTO XXX,"Their vizors off, look other than before,"
19229,CANTO XXX,The counterfeited semblance thrown aside;
19230,CANTO XXX,So into greater jubilee were chang’d
19231,CANTO XXX,"Those flowers and sparkles, and distinct I saw"
19232,CANTO XXX,Before me either court of heav’n displac’d.
19233,CANTO XXX,
19234,CANTO XXX,O prime enlightener! thou who crav’st me strength
19235,CANTO XXX,On the high triumph of thy realm to gaze!
19236,CANTO XXX,"Grant virtue now to utter what I kenn’d,"
19237,CANTO XXX,"There is in heav’n a light, whose goodly shine"
19238,CANTO XXX,Makes the Creator visible to all
19239,CANTO XXX,"Created, that in seeing him alone"
19240,CANTO XXX,"Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,"
19241,CANTO XXX,That the circumference were too loose a zone
19242,CANTO XXX,"To girdle in the sun. All is one beam,"
19243,CANTO XXX,"Reflected from the summit of the first,"
19244,CANTO XXX,"That moves, which being hence and vigour takes,"
19245,CANTO XXX,"And as some cliff, that from the bottom eyes"
19246,CANTO XXX,"Its image mirror’d in the crystal flood,"
19247,CANTO XXX,As if ’t admire its brave appareling
19248,CANTO XXX,"Of verdure and of flowers: so, round about,"
19249,CANTO XXX,"Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,"
19250,CANTO XXX,"Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth"
19251,CANTO XXX,Has to the skies return’d. How wide the leaves
19252,CANTO XXX,"Extended to their utmost of this rose,"
19253,CANTO XXX,Whose lowest step embosoms such a space
19254,CANTO XXX,"Of ample radiance! Yet, nor amplitude"
19255,CANTO XXX,"Nor height impeded, but my view with ease"
19256,CANTO XXX,Took in the full dimensions of that joy.
19257,CANTO XXX,"Near or remote, what there avails, where God"
19258,CANTO XXX,"Immediate rules, and Nature, awed, suspends"
19259,CANTO XXX,Her sway? Into the yellow of the rose
19260,CANTO XXX,"Perennial, which in bright expansiveness,"
19261,CANTO XXX,"Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent"
19262,CANTO XXX,"Of praises to the never-wint’ring sun,"
19263,CANTO XXX,"As one, who fain would speak yet holds his peace,"
19264,CANTO XXX,"Beatrice led me; and, “Behold,” she said,"
19265,CANTO XXX,“This fair assemblage! stoles of snowy white
19266,CANTO XXX,"How numberless! The city, where we dwell,"
19267,CANTO XXX,Behold how vast! and these our seats so throng’d
19268,CANTO XXX,"Few now are wanting here! In that proud stall,"
19269,CANTO XXX,"On which, the crown, already o’er its state"
19270,CANTO XXX,"Suspended, holds thine eyes—or ere thyself"
19271,CANTO XXX,"Mayst at the wedding sup,—shall rest the soul"
19272,CANTO XXX,"Of the great Harry, he who, by the world"
19273,CANTO XXX,"Augustas hail’d, to Italy must come,"
19274,CANTO XXX,"Before her day be ripe. But ye are sick,"
19275,CANTO XXX,"And in your tetchy wantonness as blind,"
19276,CANTO XXX,"As is the bantling, that of hunger dies,"
19277,CANTO XXX,"And drives away the nurse. Nor may it be,"
19278,CANTO XXX,"That he, who in the sacred forum sways,"
19279,CANTO XXX,"Openly or in secret, shall with him"
19280,CANTO XXX,Accordant walk: Whom God will not endure
19281,CANTO XXX,I’ th’ holy office long; but thrust him down
19282,CANTO XXX,"To Simon Magus, where Magna’s priest"
19283,CANTO XXX,Will sink beneath him: such will be his meed.”
19284,CANTO XXX,
19285,CANTO XXX,
19286,CANTO XXX,
19287,CANTO XXX,
19288,CANTO XXXI,CANTO XXXI
19289,CANTO XXXI,
19290,CANTO XXXI,
19291,CANTO XXXI,"In fashion, as a snow-white rose, lay then"
19292,CANTO XXXI,"Before my view the saintly multitude,"
19293,CANTO XXXI,Which in his own blood Christ espous’d. Meanwhile
19294,CANTO XXXI,"That other host, that soar aloft to gaze"
19295,CANTO XXXI,"And celebrate his glory, whom they love,"
19296,CANTO XXXI,"Hover’d around; and, like a troop of bees,"
19297,CANTO XXXI,"Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,"
19298,CANTO XXXI,"Now, clustering, where their fragrant labour glows,"
19299,CANTO XXXI,"Flew downward to the mighty flow’r, or rose"
19300,CANTO XXXI,"From the redundant petals, streaming back"
19301,CANTO XXXI,Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.
19302,CANTO XXXI,"Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold;"
19303,CANTO XXXI,The rest was whiter than the driven snow.
19304,CANTO XXXI,"And as they flitted down into the flower,"
19305,CANTO XXXI,"From range to range, fanning their plumy loins,"
19306,CANTO XXXI,"Whisper’d the peace and ardour, which they won"
19307,CANTO XXXI,"From that soft winnowing. Shadow none, the vast"
19308,CANTO XXXI,Interposition of such numerous flight
19309,CANTO XXXI,"Cast, from above, upon the flower, or view"
19310,CANTO XXXI,"Obstructed aught. For, through the universe,"
19311,CANTO XXXI,"Wherever merited, celestial light"
19312,CANTO XXXI,"Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents."
19313,CANTO XXXI,
19314,CANTO XXXI,"All there, who reign in safety and in bliss,"
19315,CANTO XXXI,"Ages long past or new, on one sole mark"
19316,CANTO XXXI,Their love and vision fix’d. O trinal beam
19317,CANTO XXXI,"Of individual star, that charmst them thus,"
19318,CANTO XXXI,Vouchsafe one glance to gild our storm below!
19319,CANTO XXXI,
19320,CANTO XXXI,"If the grim brood, from Arctic shores that roam’d,"
19321,CANTO XXXI,"(Where helice, forever, as she wheels,"
19322,CANTO XXXI,Sparkles a mother’s fondness on her son)
19323,CANTO XXXI,"Stood in mute wonder ’mid the works of Rome,"
19324,CANTO XXXI,When to their view the Lateran arose
19325,CANTO XXXI,"In greatness more than earthly; I, who then"
19326,CANTO XXXI,"From human to divine had past, from time"
19327,CANTO XXXI,"Unto eternity, and out of Florence"
19328,CANTO XXXI,"To justice and to truth, how might I choose"
19329,CANTO XXXI,"But marvel too? ’Twixt gladness and amaze,"
19330,CANTO XXXI,"In sooth no will had I to utter aught,"
19331,CANTO XXXI,"Or hear. And, as a pilgrim, when he rests"
19332,CANTO XXXI,"Within the temple of his vow, looks round"
19333,CANTO XXXI,"In breathless awe, and hopes some time to tell"
19334,CANTO XXXI,Of all its goodly state: e’en so mine eyes
19335,CANTO XXXI,"Cours’d up and down along the living light,"
19336,CANTO XXXI,"Now low, and now aloft, and now around,"
19337,CANTO XXXI,"Visiting every step. Looks I beheld,"
19338,CANTO XXXI,"Where charity in soft persuasion sat,"
19339,CANTO XXXI,"Smiles from within and radiance from above,"
19340,CANTO XXXI,And in each gesture grace and honour high.
19341,CANTO XXXI,
19342,CANTO XXXI,"So rov’d my ken, and its general form"
19343,CANTO XXXI,All Paradise survey’d: when round I turn’d
19344,CANTO XXXI,With purpose of my lady to inquire
19345,CANTO XXXI,"Once more of things, that held my thought suspense,"
19346,CANTO XXXI,But answer found from other than I ween’d;
19347,CANTO XXXI,"For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,"
19348,CANTO XXXI,"I saw instead a senior, at my side,"
19349,CANTO XXXI,"Rob’d, as the rest, in glory. Joy benign"
19350,CANTO XXXI,"Glow’d in his eye, and o’er his cheek diffus’d,"
19351,CANTO XXXI,With gestures such as spake a father’s love.
19352,CANTO XXXI,"And, “Whither is she vanish’d?” straight I ask’d."
19353,CANTO XXXI,
19354,CANTO XXXI,"“By Beatrice summon’d,” he replied,"
19355,CANTO XXXI,“I come to aid thy wish. Looking aloft
19356,CANTO XXXI,"To the third circle from the highest, there"
19357,CANTO XXXI,"Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit"
19358,CANTO XXXI,"Hath plac’d her.” Answering not, mine eyes I rais’d,"
19359,CANTO XXXI,"And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow"
19360,CANTO XXXI,A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.
19361,CANTO XXXI,Not from the centre of the sea so far
19362,CANTO XXXI,"Unto the region of the highest thunder,"
19363,CANTO XXXI,As was my ken from hers; and yet the form
19364,CANTO XXXI,"Came through that medium down, unmix’d and pure,"
19365,CANTO XXXI,
19366,CANTO XXXI,“O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!
19367,CANTO XXXI,"Who, for my safety, hast not scorn’d, in hell"
19368,CANTO XXXI,To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark’d!
19369,CANTO XXXI,"For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power"
19370,CANTO XXXI,"And goodness, virtue owe and grace. Of slave,"
19371,CANTO XXXI,"Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,"
19372,CANTO XXXI,"For my deliverance apt, hast left untried."
19373,CANTO XXXI,Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.
19374,CANTO XXXI,"That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,"
19375,CANTO XXXI,"Is loosen’d from this body, it may find"
19376,CANTO XXXI,Favour with thee.” So I my suit preferr’d:
19377,CANTO XXXI,"And she, so distant, as appear’d, look’d down,"
19378,CANTO XXXI,And smil’d; then tow’rds th’ eternal fountain turn’d.
19379,CANTO XXXI,
19380,CANTO XXXI,"And thus the senior, holy and rever’d:"
19381,CANTO XXXI,“That thou at length mayst happily conclude
19382,CANTO XXXI,"Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch’d,"
19383,CANTO XXXI,By supplication mov’d and holy love)
19384,CANTO XXXI,"Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,"
19385,CANTO XXXI,"This garden through: for so, by ray divine"
19386,CANTO XXXI,"Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;"
19387,CANTO XXXI,"And from heav’n’s queen, whom fervent I adore,"
19388,CANTO XXXI,All gracious aid befriend us; for that I
19389,CANTO XXXI,"Am her own faithful Bernard.” Like a wight,"
19390,CANTO XXXI,Who haply from Croatia wends to see
19391,CANTO XXXI,"Our Veronica, and the while ’tis shown,"
19392,CANTO XXXI,"Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,"
19393,CANTO XXXI,"And, all that he hath heard revolving, saith"
19394,CANTO XXXI,Unto himself in thought: “And didst thou look
19395,CANTO XXXI,"E’en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?"
19396,CANTO XXXI,And was this semblance thine?” So gaz’d I then
19397,CANTO XXXI,"Adoring; for the charity of him,"
19398,CANTO XXXI,"Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy’d,"
19399,CANTO XXXI,Stood lively before me. “Child of grace!”
19400,CANTO XXXI,Thus he began: “thou shalt not knowledge gain
19401,CANTO XXXI,"Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held"
19402,CANTO XXXI,Still in this depth below. But search around
19403,CANTO XXXI,"The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy"
19404,CANTO XXXI,"Seated in state, the queen, that of this realm"
19405,CANTO XXXI,"Is sovran.” Straight mine eyes I rais’d; and bright,"
19406,CANTO XXXI,"As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime"
19407,CANTO XXXI,"Above th’ horizon, where the sun declines;"
19408,CANTO XXXI,"To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale"
19409,CANTO XXXI,"To mountain sped, at th’ extreme bound, a part"
19410,CANTO XXXI,Excell’d in lustre all the front oppos’d.
19411,CANTO XXXI,"And as the glow burns ruddiest o’er the wave,"
19412,CANTO XXXI,"That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton"
19413,CANTO XXXI,"Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light"
19414,CANTO XXXI,"Diminish’d fades, intensest in the midst;"
19415,CANTO XXXI,"So burn’d the peaceful oriflamb, and slack’d"
19416,CANTO XXXI,On every side the living flame decay’d.
19417,CANTO XXXI,And in that midst their sportive pennons wav’d
19418,CANTO XXXI,Thousands of angels; in resplendence each
19419,CANTO XXXI,"Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee"
19420,CANTO XXXI,"And carol, smil’d the Lovely One of heav’n,"
19421,CANTO XXXI,That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.
19422,CANTO XXXI,
19423,CANTO XXXI,"Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,"
19424,CANTO XXXI,"As is the colouring in fancy’s loom,"
19425,CANTO XXXI,’Twere all too poor to utter the least part
19426,CANTO XXXI,Of that enchantment. When he saw mine eyes
19427,CANTO XXXI,"Intent on her, that charm’d him, Bernard gaz’d"
19428,CANTO XXXI,"With so exceeding fondness, as infus’d"
19429,CANTO XXXI,"Ardour into my breast, unfelt before."
19430,CANTO XXXI,
19431,CANTO XXXI,
19432,CANTO XXXI,
19433,CANTO XXXI,
19434,CANTO XXXII,CANTO XXXII
19435,CANTO XXXII,
19436,CANTO XXXII,
19437,CANTO XXXII,"Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,"
19438,CANTO XXXII,"Assum’d the teacher’s part, and mild began:"
19439,CANTO XXXII,"“The wound, that Mary clos’d, she open’d first,"
19440,CANTO XXXII,Who sits so beautiful at Mary’s feet.
19441,CANTO XXXII,"The third in order, underneath her, lo!"
19442,CANTO XXXII,"Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,"
19443,CANTO XXXII,"Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,"
19444,CANTO XXXII,"Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs"
19445,CANTO XXXII,Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.
19446,CANTO XXXII,"All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,"
19447,CANTO XXXII,Are in gradation throned on the rose.
19448,CANTO XXXII,"And from the seventh step, successively,"
19449,CANTO XXXII,Adown the breathing tresses of the flow’r
19450,CANTO XXXII,Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.
19451,CANTO XXXII,"For these are a partition wall, whereby"
19452,CANTO XXXII,"The sacred stairs are sever’d, as the faith"
19453,CANTO XXXII,"In Christ divides them. On this part, where blooms"
19454,CANTO XXXII,"Each leaf in full maturity, are set"
19455,CANTO XXXII,"Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ’d."
19456,CANTO XXXII,"On th’ other, where an intersected space"
19457,CANTO XXXII,"Yet shows the semicircle void, abide"
19458,CANTO XXXII,"All they, who look’d to Christ already come."
19459,CANTO XXXII,"And as our Lady on her glorious stool,"
19460,CANTO XXXII,"And they who on their stools beneath her sit,"
19461,CANTO XXXII,"This way distinction make: e’en so on his,"
19462,CANTO XXXII,The mighty Baptist that way marks the line
19463,CANTO XXXII,(He who endur’d the desert and the pains
19464,CANTO XXXII,"Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,"
19465,CANTO XXXII,"Yet still continued holy), and beneath,"
19466,CANTO XXXII,"Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,"
19467,CANTO XXXII,Thus far from round to round. So heav’n’s decree
19468,CANTO XXXII,"Forecasts, this garden equally to fill."
19469,CANTO XXXII,"With faith in either view, past or to come,"
19470,CANTO XXXII,"Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves"
19471,CANTO XXXII,"Midway the twain compartments, none there are"
19472,CANTO XXXII,"Who place obtain for merit of their own,"
19473,CANTO XXXII,"But have through others’ merit been advanc’d,"
19474,CANTO XXXII,"On set conditions: spirits all releas’d,"
19475,CANTO XXXII,Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.
19476,CANTO XXXII,"And, if thou mark and listen to them well,"
19477,CANTO XXXII,Their childish looks and voice declare as much.
19478,CANTO XXXII,
19479,CANTO XXXII,"“Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;"
19480,CANTO XXXII,"And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein"
19481,CANTO XXXII,Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee. From this realm
19482,CANTO XXXII,"Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,"
19483,CANTO XXXII,"No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can."
19484,CANTO XXXII,A law immutable hath establish’d all;
19485,CANTO XXXII,"Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,"
19486,CANTO XXXII,"Exactly, as the finger to the ring."
19487,CANTO XXXII,"It is not therefore without cause, that these,"
19488,CANTO XXXII,"O’erspeedy comers to immortal life,"
19489,CANTO XXXII,Are different in their shares of excellence.
19490,CANTO XXXII,Our Sovran Lord—that settleth this estate
19491,CANTO XXXII,"In love and in delight so absolute,"
19492,CANTO XXXII,"That wish can dare no further—every soul,"
19493,CANTO XXXII,"Created in his joyous sight to dwell,"
19494,CANTO XXXII,With grace at pleasure variously endows.
19495,CANTO XXXII,And for a proof th’ effect may well suffice.
19496,CANTO XXXII,And ’tis moreover most expressly mark’d
19497,CANTO XXXII,"In holy scripture, where the twins are said"
19498,CANTO XXXII,"To, have struggled in the womb. Therefore, as grace"
19499,CANTO XXXII,"Inweaves the coronet, so every brow"
19500,CANTO XXXII,Weareth its proper hue of orient light.
19501,CANTO XXXII,"And merely in respect to his prime gift,"
19502,CANTO XXXII,"Not in reward of meritorious deed,"
19503,CANTO XXXII,Hath each his several degree assign’d.
19504,CANTO XXXII,In early times with their own innocence
19505,CANTO XXXII,"More was not wanting, than the parents’ faith,"
19506,CANTO XXXII,"To save them: those first ages past, behoov’d"
19507,CANTO XXXII,That circumcision in the males should imp
19508,CANTO XXXII,The flight of innocent wings: but since the day
19509,CANTO XXXII,"Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites"
19510,CANTO XXXII,"In Christ accomplish’d, innocence herself"
19511,CANTO XXXII,Must linger yet below. Now raise thy view
19512,CANTO XXXII,Unto the visage most resembling Christ:
19513,CANTO XXXII,"For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win"
19514,CANTO XXXII,The pow’r to look on him.” Forthwith I saw
19515,CANTO XXXII,"Such floods of gladness on her visage shower’d,"
19516,CANTO XXXII,"From holy spirits, winging that profound;"
19517,CANTO XXXII,"That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,"
19518,CANTO XXXII,"Had not so much suspended me with wonder,"
19519,CANTO XXXII,Or shown me such similitude of God.
19520,CANTO XXXII,"And he, who had to her descended, once,"
19521,CANTO XXXII,"On earth, now hail’d in heav’n; and on pois’d wing."
19522,CANTO XXXII,"“Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,” sang:"
19523,CANTO XXXII,"To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,"
19524,CANTO XXXII,"From all parts answ’ring, rang: that holier joy"
19525,CANTO XXXII,Brooded the deep serene. “Father rever’d:
19526,CANTO XXXII,"Who deign’st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,"
19527,CANTO XXXII,"Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!"
19528,CANTO XXXII,"Say, who that angel is, that with such glee"
19529,CANTO XXXII,"Beholds our queen, and so enamour’d glows"
19530,CANTO XXXII,"Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems.”"
19531,CANTO XXXII,So I again resorted to the lore
19532,CANTO XXXII,"Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary’s charms"
19533,CANTO XXXII,"Embellish’d, as the sun the morning star;"
19534,CANTO XXXII,"Who thus in answer spake: “In him are summ’d,"
19535,CANTO XXXII,Whatever of buxomness and free delight

19537,CANTO XXXII,And so beseems: for that he bare the palm

19540,CANTO XXXII,"Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,"

19542,CANTO XXXII,"The chiefest nobles. Those, highest in bliss,"
19543,CANTO XXXII,"The twain, on each hand next our empress thron’d,"
19544,CANTO XXXII,Are as it were two roots unto this rose.
19545,CANTO XXXII,"He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste"
19546,CANTO XXXII,"Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,"
19547,CANTO XXXII,"That ancient father of the holy church,"
19548,CANTO XXXII,Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys
19549,CANTO XXXII,"Of this sweet flow’r: near whom behold the seer,"
19550,CANTO XXXII,"That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times"
19551,CANTO XXXII,"Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails"
19552,CANTO XXXII,"Was won. And, near unto the other, rests"
19553,CANTO XXXII,"The leader, under whom on manna fed"
19554,CANTO XXXII,"Th’ ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse."
19555,CANTO XXXII,"On th’ other part, facing to Peter, lo!"
19556,CANTO XXXII,"Where Anna sits, so well content to look"
19557,CANTO XXXII,"On her lov’d daughter, that with moveless eye"
19558,CANTO XXXII,"She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos’d"
19559,CANTO XXXII,"To the first father of your mortal kind,"
19560,CANTO XXXII,"Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,"
19561,CANTO XXXII,When on the edge of ruin clos’d thine eye.
19562,CANTO XXXII,
19563,CANTO XXXII,“But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)
19564,CANTO XXXII,"Here break we off, as the good workman doth,"
19565,CANTO XXXII,That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:
19566,CANTO XXXII,And to the primal love our ken shall rise;
19567,CANTO XXXII,"That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far"
19568,CANTO XXXII,"As sight can bear thee. Yet, alas! in sooth"
19569,CANTO XXXII,"Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,"
19570,CANTO XXXII,Thou backward fall’st. Grace then must first be gain’d;
19571,CANTO XXXII,"Her grace, whose might can help thee. Thou in prayer"
19572,CANTO XXXII,"Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,"
19573,CANTO XXXII,"Attend, and yield me all thy heart.” He said,"

19609,CANTO XXXIII,"Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,"
19610,CANTO XXXIII,"Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,"
19611,CANTO XXXIII,(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive
19612,CANTO XXXIII,Each cloud of his mortality away;
19613,CANTO XXXIII,That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.
19614,CANTO XXXIII,"This also I entreat of thee, O queen!"
19615,CANTO XXXIII,Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou

19624,CANTO XXXIII,"On th’ everlasting light, wherein no eye"
19625,CANTO XXXIII,"Of creature, as may well be thought, so far"
19626,CANTO XXXIII,"Can travel inward. I, meanwhile, who drew"
19627,CANTO XXXIII,"Near to the limit, where all wishes end,"
19628,CANTO XXXIII,"The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),"
19629,CANTO XXXIII,"Ended within me. Beck’ning smil’d the sage,"
19630,CANTO XXXIII,"That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,"
19631,CANTO XXXIII,Already of myself aloft I look’d;
19632,CANTO XXXIII,"For visual strength, refining more and more,"
19633,CANTO XXXIII,Bare me into the ray authentical
19634,CANTO XXXIII,"Of sovran light. Thenceforward, what I saw,"
19635,CANTO XXXIII,"Was not for words to speak, nor memory’s self"
19636,CANTO XXXIII,To stand against such outrage on her skill.
19637,CANTO XXXIII,"As one, who from a dream awaken’d, straight,"
19638,CANTO XXXIII,All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains
19639,CANTO XXXIII,Impression of the feeling in his dream;
19640,CANTO XXXIII,"E’en such am I: for all the vision dies,"
19641,CANTO XXXIII,"As ’twere, away; and yet the sense of sweet,"
19642,CANTO XXXIII,"That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart."
19643,CANTO XXXIII,Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal’d;
19644,CANTO XXXIII,Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost
19645,CANTO XXXIII,The Sybil’s sentence. O eternal beam!
19646,CANTO XXXIII,(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)
19647,CANTO XXXIII,Yield me again some little particle
19648,CANTO XXXIII,"Of what thou then appearedst, give my tongue"
19649,CANTO XXXIII,"Power, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,"
19650,CANTO XXXIII,"Unto the race to come, that shall not lose"
19651,CANTO XXXIII,"Thy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught"
19652,CANTO XXXIII,"Of memory in me, and endure to hear"
19653,CANTO XXXIII,The record sound in this unequal strain.
19654,CANTO XXXIII,
19655,CANTO XXXIII,"Such keenness from the living ray I met,"
19656,CANTO XXXIII,"That, if mine eyes had turn’d away, methinks,"
19657,CANTO XXXIII,"I had been lost; but, so embolden’d, on"
19658,CANTO XXXIII,"I pass’d, as I remember, till my view"
19659,CANTO XXXIII,Hover’d the brink of dread infinitude.
19660,CANTO XXXIII,
19661,CANTO XXXIII,O grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav’st
19662,CANTO XXXIII,Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken
19663,CANTO XXXIII,"On th’ everlasting splendour, that I look’d,"
19664,CANTO XXXIII,"While sight was unconsum’d, and, in that depth,"
19665,CANTO XXXIII,"Saw in one volume clasp’d of love, whatever"
19666,CANTO XXXIII,The universe unfolds; all properties
19667,CANTO XXXIII,"Of substance and of accident, beheld,"
19668,CANTO XXXIII,"Compounded, yet one individual light"
19669,CANTO XXXIII,The whole. And of such bond methinks I saw
19670,CANTO XXXIII,The universal form: for that whenever
19671,CANTO XXXIII,"I do but speak of it, my soul dilates"
19672,CANTO XXXIII,"Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak,"
19673,CANTO XXXIII,"One moment seems a longer lethargy,"
19674,CANTO XXXIII,Than five-and-twenty ages had appear’d
19675,CANTO XXXIII,"To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder"
19676,CANTO XXXIII,At Argo’s shadow darkening on his flood.
19677,CANTO XXXIII,
19678,CANTO XXXIII,"With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,"
19679,CANTO XXXIII,Wond’ring I gaz’d; and admiration still
19680,CANTO XXXIII,"Was kindled, as I gaz’d. It may not be,"
19681,CANTO XXXIII,"That one, who looks upon that light, can turn"
19682,CANTO XXXIII,"To other object, willingly, his view."
19683,CANTO XXXIII,"For all the good, that will may covet, there"
19684,CANTO XXXIII,"Is summ’d; and all, elsewhere defective found,"
19685,CANTO XXXIII,"Complete. My tongue shall utter now, no more"
19686,CANTO XXXIII,"E’en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe’s"
19687,CANTO XXXIII,That yet is moisten’d at his mother’s breast.
19688,CANTO XXXIII,Not that the semblance of the living light
19689,CANTO XXXIII,Was chang’d (that ever as at first remain’d)
19690,CANTO XXXIII,"But that my vision quickening, in that sole"
19691,CANTO XXXIII,"Appearance, still new miracles descry’d,"
19692,CANTO XXXIII,And toil’d me with the change. In that abyss
19693,CANTO XXXIII,"Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem’d methought,"
19694,CANTO XXXIII,Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:
19695,CANTO XXXIII,"And, from another, one reflected seem’d,"
19696,CANTO XXXIII,As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third
19697,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem’d fire, breath’d equally from both. Oh speech"
19698,CANTO XXXIII,"How feeble and how faint art thou, to give"
19699,CANTO XXXIII,Conception birth! Yet this to what I saw
19700,CANTO XXXIII,Is less than little. Oh eternal light!
19701,CANTO XXXIII,Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself
19702,CANTO XXXIII,"Sole understood, past, present, or to come!"
19703,CANTO XXXIII,"Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee"
19704,CANTO XXXIII,"Seem’d as reflected splendour, while I mus’d;"
19705,CANTO XXXIII,"For I therein, methought, in its own hue"
19706,CANTO XXXIII,Beheld our image painted: steadfastly
19707,CANTO XXXIII,I therefore por’d upon the view. As one
19708,CANTO XXXIII,"Who vers’d in geometric lore, would fain"
19709,CANTO XXXIII,"Measure the circle; and, though pondering long"
19710,CANTO XXXIII,"And deeply, that beginning, which he needs,"
19711,CANTO XXXIII,"Finds not; e’en such was I, intent to scan"
19712,CANTO XXXIII,"The novel wonder, and trace out the form,"
19713,CANTO XXXIII,"How to the circle fitted, and therein"
19714,CANTO XXXIII,How plac’d: but the flight was not for my wing;
19715,CANTO XXXIII,"Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,"
19716,CANTO XXXIII,And in the spleen unfolded what it sought.
19717,CANTO XXXIII,
19718,CANTO XXXIII,Here vigour fail’d the tow’ring fantasy:
19719,CANTO XXXIII,"But yet the will roll’d onward, like a wheel"
19720,CANTO XXXIII,"In even motion, by the Love impell’d,"
19721,CANTO XXXIII,That moves the sun in heav’n and all the stars.

20018,CANTO VI,v. 95. Vengeance for vengeance ] This will be afterwards explained by
20019,CANTO VI,the Poet himself. v. 98. Charlemagne.] Dante could not be ignorant that
20020,CANTO VI,the reign of Justinian was long prior to that of Charlemagne; but the
20021,CANTO VI,"spirit of the former emperor is represented, both in this instance and"
20022,CANTO VI,"in what follows, as conscious of the events that had taken place after"
20023,CANTO VI,his own time.
20024,CANTO VI,
20025,CANTO VI,v. 104. The yellow lilies.] The French ensign.
20026,CANTO VI,
20027,CANTO VI,"v. 110. Charles.] The commentators explain this to mean Charles II,"
20028,CANTO VI,king of Naples and Sicily. Is it not more likely to allude to Charles
20029,CANTO VI,"of Valois, son of Philip III of France, who was sent for, about this"
20030,CANTO VI,"time, into Italy by Pope Boniface, with the promise of being made"
20031,CANTO VI,"emperor? See G. Villani, 1. viii. c. 42."
20032,CANTO VI,
20033,CANTO VI,v. 131. Romeo’s light.] The story of Romeo is involved in some
20034,CANTO VI,uncertainty. The French writers assert the continuance of his
20035,CANTO VI,ministerial office even after the decease of his soverign Raymond
20036,CANTO VI,"Berenger, count of Provence: and they rest this assertion chiefly on"
20037,CANTO VI,"the fact of a certain Romieu de Villeneuve, who was the contemporary of"
20038,CANTO VI,"that prince, having left large possessions behind him, as appears by"
20039,CANTO VI,"his will, preserved in the archives of the bishopric of Venice. There"
20040,CANTO VI,"might however have been more than one person of the name of Romieu, or"
20041,CANTO VI,Romeo which answers to that of Palmer in our language. Nor is it
20042,CANTO VI,"probable that the Italians, who lived so near the time, were"
20043,CANTO VI,"misinformed in an occurrence of such notoriety. According to them,"
20044,CANTO VI,"after he had long been a faithful steward to Raymond, when an account"
20045,CANTO VI,"was required from him of the revenues whichhe had carefully husbanded,"
20046,CANTO VI,"and his master as lavishly disbursed, “He demanded the little mule, the"
20047,CANTO VI,"staff, and the scrip, with which he had first entered into the count’s"
20048,CANTO VI,"service, a stranger pilgrim from the shrine of St. James in Galicia,"
20049,CANTO VI,and parted as he came; nor was it ever known whence he was or wither he
20050,CANTO VI,"went.” G. Villani, 1. vi. c. 92."
20051,CANTO VI,
20052,CANTO VI,"v. 135. Four daughters.] Of the four daughters of Raymond Berenger,"
20053,CANTO VI,"Margaret, the eldest, was married to Louis IX of France; Eleanor; the"
20054,CANTO VI,"next, to Henry III, of England; Sancha, the third, to Richard, Henry’s"
20055,CANTO VI,"brother, and King of the Romans; and the youngest, Beatrice, to Charles"
20056,CANTO VI,"I, King of Naples and Sicily, and brother to Louis."
20057,CANTO VI,
20058,CANTO VI,"v. 136. Raymond Berenger.] This prince, the last of the house of"
20059,CANTO VI,"Barcelona, who was count of Provence, died in 1245. He is in the list"
20060,CANTO VI,"of Provencal poets. See Millot, Hist, Litt des Troubadours, t. ii. P."

20075,CANTO VII,v. 23. That man who was unborn.] Adam.
20076,CANTO VII,
20077,CANTO VII,"v. 61. What distils.] “That which proceeds immediately from God, and"
20078,CANTO VII,"without intervention of secondary causes, in immortal.”"
20079,CANTO VII,
20080,CANTO VII,v. 140. Our resurrection certain.] “Venturi appears to mistake the
20081,CANTO VII,"Poet’s reasoning, when he observes: “Wretched for us, if we had not"
20082,CANTO VII,"arguments more convincing, and of a higher kind, to assure us of the"
20083,CANTO VII,"truth of our resurrection.” It is here intended, I think, that the"
20084,CANTO VII,whole of God’s dispensations to man should be considered as a proof of
20085,CANTO VII,our resurrection. The conclusion is that as before sin man was
20086,CANTO VII,"immortal, so being restored to the favor of heaven by the expiation"
20087,CANTO VII,"made for sin, he necessarily recovers his claim to immortality."
20088,CANTO VII,
20089,CANTO VII,There is much in this poem to justify the encomium which the learned
20090,CANTO VII,"Salvini has passed on it, when, in an epistle to Redi, imitating what"
20091,CANTO VII,"Horace had said of Homer, that the duties of life might be better"
20092,CANTO VII,learnt from the Grecian bard than from the teachers of the porch or the
20093,CANTO VII,"academy, he says—"

20349,CANTO X,"was passed in superintending the school, and in composing his"
20350,CANTO X,voluminous works on divinity and natural science. He died in 1280. The
20351,CANTO X,absurd imputation of his having dealt in the magical art is well known;
20352,CANTO X,and his biographers take some pains to clear him of it. Scriptores

20377,CANTO X,"studies, and for that purpose remained some time at Rheims, whence he"
20378,CANTO X,afterwards proceeded to Paris. Here his reputation was so great that
20379,CANTO X,"Philip, brother of Louis VII., being chosen bishop of Paris, resigned"
20380,CANTO X,"that dignity to Pietro, whose pupil he had been. He held his bishopric"
20381,CANTO X,"only one year, and died in 1160. His Liber Sententiarum is highly"
20382,CANTO X,"esteemed. It contains a system of scholastic theology, so much more"

20396,CANTO X,of raising their souls above all human things in order to unite them to
20397,CANTO X,"their great source by sublime contemplation, lived most probably in"

21330,CANTO XXV,"itself not only over all Spain, but even round about to foreign"
21331,CANTO XXV,nations. Multitudes from all parts of the world came to visit it. Many
21332,CANTO XXV,"others were deterred by the difficulty for the journey, by the"
21333,CANTO XXV,"roughness and barrenness of those parts, and by the incursions of the"
21334,CANTO XXV,"Moors, who made captives many of the pilgrims. The canons of St. Eloy"
21335,CANTO XXV,"afterwards (the precise time is not known), with a desire of remedying"
21336,CANTO XXV,"these evils, built, in many places, along the whole read, which reached"
21337,CANTO XXV,"as far as to France, hospitals for the reception of the pilgrims.”"
21338,CANTO XXV,
21339,CANTO XXV,v. 31. Who.] The Epistle of St. James is here attributed to the elder
21340,CANTO XXV,"apostle of that name, whose shrine was at Compostella, in Galicia."
21341,CANTO XXV,Which of the two was the author of it is yet doubtful. The learned and
21342,CANTO XXV,candid Michaelis contends very forcibly for its having been written by
21343,CANTO XXV,James the Elder. Lardner rejects that opinion as absurd; while Benson
21344,CANTO XXV,"argues against it, but is well answered by Michaelis, who after all, is"
21345,CANTO XXV,obliged to leave the question undecided. See his Introduction to the

21482,CANTO XXVII,"v. 112. Time’s roots.] “Here,” says Beatrice, “are the roots, from"
21483,CANTO XXVII,"whence time springs: for the parts, into which it is divided, the other"
21484,CANTO XXVII,heavens must be considered.” And she then breaks out into an
21485,CANTO XXVII,"exclamation on the degeneracy of human nature, which does not lift"
21486,CANTO XXVII,itself to the contemplation of divine things.
21487,CANTO XXVII,
21488,CANTO XXVII,v. 126. The fair child of him.] So she calls human nature. Pindar by a

21496,CANTO XXVII,"to so large a portion of time, that January shall be no more a winter"
21497,CANTO XXVII,"month.” By this periphrasis is meant “ in a short time,” as we say"
21498,CANTO XXVII,"familiarly, such a thing will happen before a thousand years are over"
21499,CANTO XXVII,"when we mean, it will happen soon."
21500,CANTO XXVII,
21501,CANTO XXVII,v. 135. Fortune shall be fain.] The commentators in general suppose
21502,CANTO XXVII,"that our Poet here augurs that great reform, which he vainly hoped"
21503,CANTO XXVII,would follow on the arrival of the Emperor Henry VII. in Italy.
21504,CANTO XXVII,"Lombardi refers the prognostication to Can Grande della Scala: and,"
21505,CANTO XXVII,when we consider that this Canto was not finished till after the death
21506,CANTO XXVII,"of Henry, as appears from the mention that is made of John XXII, it"
21507,CANTO XXVII,cannot be denied but the conjecture is probable.

21514,CANTO XXVIII,nature.”
21515,CANTO XXVIII,
21516,CANTO XXVIII,v. 43. Such diff’rence.] The material world and the intelligential (the
21517,CANTO XXVIII,"copy and the pattern) appear to Dante to differ in this respect, that"
21518,CANTO XXVIII,"the orbits of the latter are more swift, the nearer they are to the"
21519,CANTO XXVIII,"centre, whereas the contrary is the case with the orbits of the former."
21520,CANTO XXVIII,The seeming contradiction is thus accounted for by Beatrice. In the
21521,CANTO XXVIII,"material world, the more ample the body is, the greater is the good of"
21522,CANTO XXVIII,which itis capable supposing all the parts to be equally perfect. But
21523,CANTO XXVIII,"in the intelligential world, the circles are more excellent and"
21524,CANTO XXVIII,"powerful, the more they approximate to the central point, which is God."
21525,CANTO XXVIII,"Thus the first circle, that of the seraphim, corresponds to the ninth"
21526,CANTO XXVIII,"sphere, or primum mobile, the second, that of the cherubim, to the"
21527,CANTO XXVIII,"eighth sphere, or heaven of fixed stars; the third, or circle of"
21528,CANTO XXVIII,"thrones, to the seventh sphere, or planet of Saturn; and in like manner"
21529,CANTO XXVIII,throughout the two other trines of circles and spheres.

21739,PREFACE,
21740,PREFACE,"In the years 1805 and 1806, I published the first part of the following"
21741,PREFACE,"translation, with the text of the original. Since that period, two"
21742,PREFACE,"impressions of the whole of the Divina Commedia, in Italian, have made"
21743,PREFACE,their appearance in this country. It is not necessary that I should add
21744,PREFACE,"a third: and I am induced to hope that the Poem, even in the present"
21745,PREFACE,"version of it, may not be without interest for the mere English reader."
21746,PREFACE,
21747,PREFACE,"The translation of the second and third parts, “The Purgatory” and “The"
21748,PREFACE,"Paradise,” was begun long before the first, and as early as the year"
21749,PREFACE,"1797; but, owing to many interruptions, not concluded till the summer"
21750,PREFACE,before last. On a retrospect of the time and exertions that have been
21751,PREFACE,"thus employed, I do not regard those hours as the least happy of my"
21752,PREFACE,"life, during which (to use the eloquent language of Mr. Coleridge) “my"
21753,PREFACE,"individual recollections have been suspended, and lulled to sleep amid"
21754,PREFACE,"the music of nobler thoughts;” nor that study as misapplied, which has"
21755,PREFACE,familiarized me with one of the sublimest efforts of the human
21756,PREFACE,invention.

21758,PREFACE,"To those, who shall be at the trouble of examining into the degree of"
21759,PREFACE,"accuracy with which the task has been executed, I may be allowed to"
21760,PREFACE,"suggest, that their judgment should not be formed on a comparison with"
21761,PREFACE,"any single text of my Author; since, in more instances than I have"
21762,PREFACE,"noticed, I have had to make my choice out of a variety of readings and"
21763,PREFACE,"interpretations, presented by different editions and commentators."
21764,PREFACE,
21765,PREFACE,In one or two of those editions is to be found the title of “The
21766,PREFACE,"Vision,” which I have adopted, as more conformable to the genius of our"
21767,PREFACE,"language than that of “The Divine Comedy.” Dante himself, I believe,"
21768,PREFACE,"termed it simply “The Comedy;” in the first place, because the style"
21769,PREFACE,"was of the middle kind: and in the next, because the story (if story it"
21770,PREFACE,may be called) ends happily.
21771,PREFACE,
21772,PREFACE,"Instead of a Life of my Author, I have subjoined, in chronological"
21773,PREFACE,"order, a view not only of the principal events which befell him, but of"
