43,INTRODUCTION.,_Faustus is therefore a parable of the impotent yearnings of the
44,INTRODUCTION.,"Middle Ages--its passionate aspiration, its conscience-stricken"
45,INTRODUCTION.,"desire, its fettered curiosity amid the tramping limits of"
46,INTRODUCTION.,imperfect knowledge and irrational dogmatism. The indestructible
47,INTRODUCTION.,"beauty of Greek art,--whereof Helen was an emblem, became, through"
48,INTRODUCTION.,"the discovery of classic poetry and sculpture, the possession of"
49,INTRODUCTION.,"the modern world. Mediævalism took this Helen to wife, and their"

52,INTRODUCTION.,54.
53,INTRODUCTION.,
54,INTRODUCTION.,
55,INTRODUCTION.,Euphorion is the name given by Goethe to the marvellous child born of
56,INTRODUCTION.,"the mystic marriage of Faust and Helena. Who Faust is, and who Helena,"
57,INTRODUCTION.,"we all know. Faust, of whom no man can remember the youth or childhood,"
58,INTRODUCTION.,"seems to have come into the world by some evil spell, already old and"
59,INTRODUCTION.,with the faintness of body and of mind which are the heritage of age;
60,INTRODUCTION.,and every additional year of mysterious study and abortive effort has
61,INTRODUCTION.,"made him more vacillating of step and uncertain of sight, but only more"
62,INTRODUCTION.,"hungry of soul. Postponed and repressed by reclusion from the world, and"
63,INTRODUCTION.,desperate tension over insoluble problems; diverted into the channels of
64,INTRODUCTION.,"mere thought and vision; there boils within him the energy, the passion,"
65,INTRODUCTION.,"of retarded youth: its appetites and curiosities, which, cramped by the"
66,INTRODUCTION.,"intolerant will, and foiled by many a sudden palsy of limb and mind,"
67,INTRODUCTION.,"torment him with mad visions of unreal worlds, mock him with dreams of"
68,INTRODUCTION.,"superhuman powers, from which he awakes in impotent and apathetic"
69,INTRODUCTION.,anguish. But these often-withstood and often-baffled cravings are not
70,INTRODUCTION.,"those merely of scholar or wizard, they are those of soldier and poet"
71,INTRODUCTION.,"and monk, of the mere man: lawless desires which he seeks to divert, but"
72,INTRODUCTION.,"fails, from the things of the flesh and of the world to the things of"
73,INTRODUCTION.,"the reason; supersensuous desires for the beautiful and intangible,"
74,INTRODUCTION.,"which he strives to crush, but in vain, with the cynical scepticism of"
75,INTRODUCTION.,"science, which derides the things it cannot grasp. In this strange"
76,INTRODUCTION.,"Faustus, made up of so many and conflicting instincts; in this old man"
77,INTRODUCTION.,"with ever-budding and ever-nipped feelings of youthfulness, muddling the"
78,INTRODUCTION.,hard-won secrets of nature in search after impossibilities; in him so
79,INTRODUCTION.,"all-sided, and yet so wilfully narrowed, so restlessly active, yet so"
80,INTRODUCTION.,"often palsied and apathetic; in this Faustus, who has laboured so much"
81,INTRODUCTION.,"and succeeded in so little, feeling himself at the end, when he has"
82,INTRODUCTION.,"summed up all his studies, as foolish as before--which of us has not"
83,INTRODUCTION.,"learned to recognize the impersonated Middle Ages? And Helena, we know"
84,INTRODUCTION.,"her also, she is the spirit of Antiquity. Personified, but we dare"
85,INTRODUCTION.,"scarcely say, embodied; for she is a ghost raised by the spells of"
86,INTRODUCTION.,"Faustus, a simulacrum of a thing long dead; yet with such continuing"
87,INTRODUCTION.,"semblance of life, nay, with all life's real powers, that she seems the"
88,INTRODUCTION.,"real, vital, living one, and Faustus yonder, thing as he is of the"
89,INTRODUCTION.,"present, little better than a spectre. Yet Helena has been ages before"
90,INTRODUCTION.,"Faust ever was; nay, by an awful mystery like those which involve the"
91,INTRODUCTION.,"birth of Pagan gods, she whom he has evoked to be the mother of his only"
92,INTRODUCTION.,"son has given, centuries before, somewhat of her life to make this"
93,INTRODUCTION.,"self-same Faust. A strange mystery of Fate's necromancy this, and with"
94,INTRODUCTION.,"strange anomalies. For opposite this living, decrepit Faust, Helena, the"
95,INTRODUCTION.,"long dead, is young; and she is all that which Faust is not. Knowing"
96,INTRODUCTION.,"much less than he, who has plunged his thoughts like his scalpel into"
97,INTRODUCTION.,"all the mysteries of life and death, she yet knows much more, can tell"
98,INTRODUCTION.,"him of the objects and aims of men and things; nay, with little more"
99,INTRODUCTION.,"than the unconscious faithfulness to instinct of the clean-limbed,"
100,INTRODUCTION.,"placid brute, she can give peace to his tormented conscience; and, while"
101,INTRODUCTION.,he has suffered and struggled and lashed himself for every seeming
102,INTRODUCTION.,"baseness of desire, and loathed himself for every imagined microscopic"
103,INTRODUCTION.,"soiling, she has walked through good and evil, letting the vileness of"
104,INTRODUCTION.,"sin trickle off her unhidden soul, so quietly and majestically that all"
105,INTRODUCTION.,"thought of evil vanishes; and the self-tormenting wretch, with macerated"
106,INTRODUCTION.,"flesh hidden beneath the heavy garments of mysticism and philosophy,"
107,INTRODUCTION.,"suddenly feels, in the presence of her unabashed nakedness, that he,"
108,INTRODUCTION.,"like herself, is chaste."
109,INTRODUCTION.,
110,INTRODUCTION.,"Such are the parents, Faustus and Helena; we know them; but who is this"
111,INTRODUCTION.,son Euphorion? To me it seems as if there could be but one answer--the
112,INTRODUCTION.,"Renaissance. Goethe indeed has told us (though, with his rejuvenation of"
113,INTRODUCTION.,"Faustus, unknown to the old German legend and to our Marlowe, in how"
114,INTRODUCTION.,bungling a manner!) the tale of that mystic marriage; but Goethe could
115,INTRODUCTION.,"not tell us rightly, even had he attempted, the real name of its"
116,INTRODUCTION.,"offspring. For even so short a time ago, the Middle Ages were only"
117,INTRODUCTION.,"beginning to be more than a mere historical expression, Antiquity was"
118,INTRODUCTION.,"being only then critically discovered; and the Renaissance, but vaguely"
119,INTRODUCTION.,"seen and quite unformulated by the first men, Gibbon and Roscoe, who"
120,INTRODUCTION.,"perceived it at all, was still virtually unknown. To Goethe, therefore,"
121,INTRODUCTION.,it might easily have seemed as if the antique Helena had only just been
122,INTRODUCTION.,"evoked, and as if of her union with the worn-out century of his birth, a"
123,INTRODUCTION.,"real Euphorion, the age in which ourselves are living, might have been"
124,INTRODUCTION.,"born. But, at the distance of additional time, and from the undreamed-of"
125,INTRODUCTION.,"height upon which recent historical science has enabled us to stand, we"
126,INTRODUCTION.,can easily see that in this he would have been mistaken. Not only is our
127,INTRODUCTION.,"modern culture no child of Faustus and Helena, but it is the complex"
128,INTRODUCTION.,"descendant, strangely featured by atavism from various sides, of many"
129,INTRODUCTION.,"and various civilizations; and the eighteenth century, so far from being"
130,INTRODUCTION.,"a Faustus evoking as his bride the long dead Helen of Antiquity, was in"
131,INTRODUCTION.,itself a curiously varied grandchild or great-grandchild of such a
132,INTRODUCTION.,"marriage, its every moral feature, its every intellectual movement"
133,INTRODUCTION.,proclaiming how much of its being was inherited from Antiquity. No
134,INTRODUCTION.,"allegory, I well know, and least of all no historical allegory, can ever"
135,INTRODUCTION.,be strained to fit quite tight--the lives of individuals and those of
136,INTRODUCTION.,"centuries, their modes of intermixture, genesis, and inheritance are far"
137,INTRODUCTION.,"different; but if an allegory is to possess any meaning at all, we must"
138,INTRODUCTION.,surely apply it wherever it will fit most easily and completely; and the
139,INTRODUCTION.,beautiful allegory prepared by the tradition of the sixteenth century
140,INTRODUCTION.,"for the elaborating genius of Goethe, can have a real meaning only if we"
141,INTRODUCTION.,"explain Faust as representing the Middle Ages, Helena as Antiquity, and"
142,INTRODUCTION.,"Euphorion as that child of the Middle Ages, taking life and reality from"
143,INTRODUCTION.,"them, but born of and curiously nurtured by the spirit of Antiquity, to"
144,INTRODUCTION.,which significant accident has given the name of Renaissance.
145,INTRODUCTION.,
146,INTRODUCTION.,After Euphorion I have therefore christened this book; and this not from
147,INTRODUCTION.,any irrational conceit of knowing more (when I am fully aware that I
148,INTRODUCTION.,know infinitely less) than other writers about the life and character of
149,INTRODUCTION.,"this wonderful child of Helena and Faustus, but merely because it is"
150,INTRODUCTION.,"more particularly as the offspring of this miraculous marriage, and with"
151,INTRODUCTION.,"reference to the harmonies and anomalies which therefrom resulted, that"
152,INTRODUCTION.,Euphorion has exercised my thoughts.
153,INTRODUCTION.,
154,INTRODUCTION.,"The Renaissance has interested and interests me, not merely for what it"
155,INTRODUCTION.,"is, but even more for what it sprang from, and for the manner in which"
156,INTRODUCTION.,"the many things inherited from both Middle Ages and Renaissance, the"
157,INTRODUCTION.,"tendencies and necessities inherent in every special civilization, acted"
158,INTRODUCTION.,"and reacted upon each other, united in concord or antagonism; forming,"
159,INTRODUCTION.,"like the gases of the chemist, new things, sometimes like and sometimes"
160,INTRODUCTION.,unlike themselves and each other; producing now some unknown substance
161,INTRODUCTION.,"of excellence and utility, at other times some baneful element, known"
162,INTRODUCTION.,"but too well elsewhere, but unexpected here. But not the watching of the"
163,INTRODUCTION.,often tragic meeting of these great fatalities of inherited spirit and
164,INTRODUCTION.,habit only: for equally fascinating almost has been the watching of the
165,INTRODUCTION.,"elaboration by this double-natured period of things of little weight,"
166,INTRODUCTION.,mere trifles of artistic material bequeathed to it by one or by the
167,INTRODUCTION.,other of its spiritual parents. The charm for me--a charm sometimes
168,INTRODUCTION.,"pleasurable, but sometimes also painful, like the imperious necessity"
169,INTRODUCTION.,"which we sometimes feel to see again and examine, seemingly uselessly,"
170,INTRODUCTION.,"some horrible evil--the charm, I mean the involuntary compulsion of"
171,INTRODUCTION.,"attention, has often been as great in following the vicissitudes of a"
172,INTRODUCTION.,"mere artistic item, like the Carolingian stories or the bucolic element,"
173,INTRODUCTION.,as it has been in looking on at the dissolution of moral and social
174,INTRODUCTION.,"elements. And in this, that I have tried to understand only where my"
175,INTRODUCTION.,"curiosity was awakened, tried to reconstruct only where my fancy was"
176,INTRODUCTION.,"taken; in short, studied of this Renaissance civilization only as much"
177,INTRODUCTION.,"or as little as I cared, depends all the incompleteness and irrelevancy"
178,INTRODUCTION.,"and unsatisfactoriness of this book, and depends also whatever addition"
179,INTRODUCTION.,to knowledge or pleasure it may afford; Were I desirous of giving a
180,INTRODUCTION.,"complete, clear notion of the very complex civilization of the"
181,INTRODUCTION.,"Renaissance, a kind of encyclopædic atlas of that period, where (by a"
182,INTRODUCTION.,double power which history alone possesses) you could see at once the
183,INTRODUCTION.,"whole extent and shape of this historical territory, and at the same"
184,INTRODUCTION.,"time, with all its bosses of mountain and furrows of valley, the exact"
185,INTRODUCTION.,"composition of all its various earths and waters, the exact actual"
186,INTRODUCTION.,"colour and shape of all its different vegetations, not to speak of its"
187,INTRODUCTION.,"big towns and dotting villages;--were I desirous of doing this, I should"
188,INTRODUCTION.,"not merely be attempting a work completely beyond my faculties, but a"
189,INTRODUCTION.,work moreover already carried out with all the perfection due to
190,INTRODUCTION.,"specially adapted gifts, to infinite patience and ingenuity,"
191,INTRODUCTION.,occasionally amounting almost to genius. Such is not at all within my
192,INTRODUCTION.,"wishes, as it assuredly would be totally without my powers."
193,INTRODUCTION.,
194,INTRODUCTION.,"But besides such marvels of historic mapping as I have described, where"
195,INTRODUCTION.,"every one can find at a glance whatever he may be looking for, and get"
196,INTRODUCTION.,"the whole topography, geological and botanical, of an historic tract at"
197,INTRODUCTION.,"his fingers' ends, there are yet other kinds of work which may be done."
198,INTRODUCTION.,For a period in history is like a more or less extended real landscape:
199,INTRODUCTION.,"it has, if you will, actual, chemically defined colours in this and"
200,INTRODUCTION.,"that, if you consider this and that separate and unaffected by any kind"
201,INTRODUCTION.,of visual medium; and measurable distances also between this point and
202,INTRODUCTION.,"the other, if you look down upon it as from a balloon. But, like a real"
203,INTRODUCTION.,"landscape, it may also be seen from different points of view, and under"
204,INTRODUCTION.,"different lights; then, according as you stand, the features of the"
205,INTRODUCTION.,"scene will group themselves--this ridge will disappear behind that, this"
206,INTRODUCTION.,"valley will open out before you, that other will be closed. Similarly,"
207,INTRODUCTION.,"according to the light wherein the landscape is seen, the relative scale"
208,INTRODUCTION.,"of colours and tints of objects, due to pervading light and to"
209,INTRODUCTION.,distances--what painters call the values--will alter: the scene will
210,INTRODUCTION.,"possess one or two predominant effects, it will produce also one or, at"
211,INTRODUCTION.,"most, two or three (in which case co-ordinated) impressions. The art"
212,INTRODUCTION.,"which deals with impressions, which tries to seize the real relative"
213,INTRODUCTION.,"values of colours and tints at a given moment, is what you call"
214,INTRODUCTION.,new-fangled: its doctrines and works are still subject to the reproach
215,INTRODUCTION.,"of charlatanry. Yet it is the only truly realistic art, and it only, by"
216,INTRODUCTION.,"giving you a thing as it appears at a given moment, gives it you as it"
217,INTRODUCTION.,"really ever is; all the rest is the result of cunning abstraction, and"
218,INTRODUCTION.,"representing the scene as it is always, represents it (by striking an"
219,INTRODUCTION.,average) as it never is at all. I do not pretend that in questions of
220,INTRODUCTION.,history we can proceed upon the principles of modern landscape painting:
221,INTRODUCTION.,"we do not know what were the elevations which made perspective, what"
222,INTRODUCTION.,"were the effects of light which created scales of tints, in that far"
223,INTRODUCTION.,"distant country of the past; and it is safer certainly, and doubtless"
224,INTRODUCTION.,"much more useful, to strike an average, and represent the past as seen"
225,INTRODUCTION.,"neither from here nor from there, neither in this light nor that, and"
226,INTRODUCTION.,let each man imagine his historical perspective and colour value to the
227,INTRODUCTION.,"best of his powers. Yet it is nevertheless certain that the past, to the"
228,INTRODUCTION.,"people who were in it, was not a miraculous map or other marvellous"
229,INTRODUCTION.,diagram constructed on the principle of getting at the actual qualities
230,INTRODUCTION.,"of things by analysis; that it must have been, to its inhabitants, but a"
231,INTRODUCTION.,series of constantly varied perspectives and constantly varied schemes
232,INTRODUCTION.,"of colour, according to the position of each individual, and the light"
233,INTRODUCTION.,in which that individual viewed it. To attempt to reconstruct those
234,INTRODUCTION.,"various perspective-making heights, to rearrange those various"
235,INTRODUCTION.,"value-determining lights, would be to the last degree disastrous; we"
236,INTRODUCTION.,"should have valleys where there existed mountains, and brilliant warm"
237,INTRODUCTION.,schemes of colour where there may have been all harmonies of pale and
238,INTRODUCTION.,neutral tints. Still the perspective and colour valuation of individual
239,INTRODUCTION.,minds there must have been; and since it is not given to us to reproduce
240,INTRODUCTION.,"those of the near spectator in a region which we can never enter, we may"
241,INTRODUCTION.,yet sometimes console ourselves for the too melancholy abstractness and
242,INTRODUCTION.,"averageness of scientific representations, by painting that distant"
243,INTRODUCTION.,"historic country as distant indeed, but as its far-off hill ranges and"
244,INTRODUCTION.,"shimmering plains really appear in their combination of form and colour,"
245,INTRODUCTION.,"from the height of an individual interest of our own, and beneath the"
246,INTRODUCTION.,"light of our individual character. We see only very little at a time,"
247,INTRODUCTION.,and that little is not what it appeared to the men of the past; but we
248,INTRODUCTION.,"see at least, if not the same things, yet in the same manner in which"
249,INTRODUCTION.,"they saw, as we see from the standpoints of personal interest and in the"
250,INTRODUCTION.,light of personal temper. Scientifically we doubtless lose; but is the
251,INTRODUCTION.,"past to be treated only scientifically? and can it not give us, and do"
252,INTRODUCTION.,"we not owe it, something more than a mere understanding of why and how?"
253,INTRODUCTION.,Is it a thing so utterly dead as to be fit only for the scalpel and the
254,INTRODUCTION.,microscope?
255,INTRODUCTION.,
256,INTRODUCTION.,"Surely not so. The past can give us, and should give us, not merely"
257,INTRODUCTION.,"ideas, but emotions: healthy pleasure which may make us more light of"
258,INTRODUCTION.,"spirit, and pain which may make us more earnest of mind; the one, it"
259,INTRODUCTION.,"seems to me, as necessary for our individual worthiness as is the other."
260,INTRODUCTION.,"For to each of us, as we watch the past, as we lie passive and let it"
261,INTRODUCTION.,"slowly circulate around us, there must come sights which, in their"
262,INTRODUCTION.,"reality or in their train of associations, and to the mind of each"
263,INTRODUCTION.,"differently, must gladden as with a sense of beauty, or put us all into"
264,INTRODUCTION.,"a sullen moral ache. I should hate to be misunderstood in this more,"
265,INTRODUCTION.,"perhaps, than in anything else in the world. I speak not of any dramatic"
266,INTRODUCTION.,"emotion, of such egotistic, half-artistic pleasure as some may get from"
267,INTRODUCTION.,"the alternation of cheerfulness and terror, from the excitement caused"
268,INTRODUCTION.,by evil from which we are as safely separated as are those who look on
269,INTRODUCTION.,"from the enfuriate bulls in an arena. To such, history, and the history"
270,INTRODUCTION.,"especially of the Renaissance, has been made to pander up but too much."
271,INTRODUCTION.,The pain I speak of is the pain which must come to every morally
272,INTRODUCTION.,sentient creature with the contemplation of some one of the horrible
273,INTRODUCTION.,"tangles of evil, of the still fouler intermeshing of evil with good,"
274,INTRODUCTION.,"which history brings up ever and anon. Evil which is past, it is true,"
275,INTRODUCTION.,"but of which the worst evil almost of all, the fact of its having been,"
276,INTRODUCTION.,"can never be past, must ever remain present; and our trouble and"
277,INTRODUCTION.,"indignation at which is holy, our pain is healthy: holy and healthy,"
278,INTRODUCTION.,because every vibration of such pain as that makes our moral fibre more
279,INTRODUCTION.,sensitive; because every immunity from such sensation deadens our higher
280,INTRODUCTION.,"nature: holy and healthy also because, just as no image of pleasurable"
281,INTRODUCTION.,things can pass before us without gathering about it other images of
282,INTRODUCTION.,"some beauty which have long lain by in each individual mind, so also no"
283,INTRODUCTION.,"thought of great injustice of man or of accident, of signal whitewashing"
284,INTRODUCTION.,"of evil or befouling of good, but must, in striking into our soul, put"
285,INTRODUCTION.,in motion there the salutary thought of some injustice or lying
286,INTRODUCTION.,"legitimation or insidious pollution, smaller indeed perhaps, but perhaps"
287,INTRODUCTION.,also nearer to ourselves.
288,INTRODUCTION.,
289,INTRODUCTION.,Be not therefore too hard upon me if in what I have written of the
290,INTRODUCTION.,"Renaissance, there is too little attempt to make matters scientifically"
291,INTRODUCTION.,"complete, and too much giving way to personal and perhaps sometimes"
292,INTRODUCTION.,irrelevant impressions of pleasure and of pain; if I have followed up
293,INTRODUCTION.,those pleasurable and painful impressions rather more than sought to
294,INTRODUCTION.,discover the exact geography of the historical tract which gave them.
295,INTRODUCTION.,"Consider, moreover, that this very cause of deficiency may have been"
296,INTRODUCTION.,also the cause of my having succeeded in achieving anything at all.
297,INTRODUCTION.,"Personal impression has led me, perhaps, sometimes away from the direct"
298,INTRODUCTION.,"road; but had it not beckoned me to follow, I should most likely have"
299,INTRODUCTION.,"simply not stirred. Pleasant impression and painful, as I have said; and"
300,INTRODUCTION.,sometimes the painful has been more efficacious than the other. I do not
301,INTRODUCTION.,know whether the interest which I have always taken in the old squabble
302,INTRODUCTION.,of real and ideal has enabled me to make at all clearer the different
303,INTRODUCTION.,"characteristics of painting and sculpture in Renaissance portraiture,"
304,INTRODUCTION.,the relation of the art of Raphael to the art of Velasquez and the art
305,INTRODUCTION.,of Whistler. I can scarcely judge whether the pleasure which I owe to
306,INTRODUCTION.,"the crowding together, the moving about in my fancy, of the heroes and"
307,INTRODUCTION.,wizards and hippogriffs of the old tales of Oberon and Ogier; the
308,INTRODUCTION.,"association with the knights and ladies of Boiardo and Ariosto, of this"
309,INTRODUCTION.,"or that figure out of a fresco of Pinturicchio, or a picture by Dosso,"
310,INTRODUCTION.,has made it easier or more difficult for me to sum up the history of
311,INTRODUCTION.,mediæval romance in Renaissance Italy; nor whether the recollection of
312,INTRODUCTION.,"certain Tuscan farms, the well-known scent of the sun-dried fennel and"
313,INTRODUCTION.,"mint under the vine-trellis, the droning song of the contadino ploughing"
314,INTRODUCTION.,"or pruning unseen in the valley, the snatches of peasants' rhymes, the"
315,INTRODUCTION.,"outlines of peasants' faces--things all these of this our own time, of"
316,INTRODUCTION.,"yesterday or to-day; whether all this, running in my mind like so many"
317,INTRODUCTION.,scribbly illustrations and annotations along the margin of Lorenzo dei
318,INTRODUCTION.,"Medici's poems, has made my studies of rustic poetry more clear or more"
319,INTRODUCTION.,"confused. But this much I know as a certainty, that never should I have"
320,INTRODUCTION.,tried to unravel the causes of the Renaissance's horrible anomaly of
321,INTRODUCTION.,"improvement and degradation, had not that anomaly returned and returned"
322,INTRODUCTION.,to make me wretched with its loathsome mixture of good and evil; its
323,INTRODUCTION.,detestable alternative of endurance of vile solidarities in the souls of
324,INTRODUCTION.,"our intellectual forefathers, or of unjust turning away from the men and"
325,INTRODUCTION.,the times whose moral degradation paid the price of our moral dignity. I
326,INTRODUCTION.,also have the further certainty of its having been this long-endured
327,INTRODUCTION.,"moral sickening at the sight of this moral anomaly, which enabled me to"
328,INTRODUCTION.,realize the feelings of such of our nobler Elizabethan playwrights as
329,INTRODUCTION.,sought to epitomize in single tales of horror the strange impressions
330,INTRODUCTION.,left by the accomplished and infamous Italy of their day; and which made
331,INTRODUCTION.,it possible for me to express perhaps some of the trouble which filled
332,INTRODUCTION.,the mind of Webster and of Tourneur merely by expressing the trouble
333,INTRODUCTION.,which filled my own.
334,INTRODUCTION.,
335,INTRODUCTION.,"The following studies are not samples, fragments at which one tries"
336,INTRODUCTION.,"one's hand, of some large and methodical scheme of work. They are mere"
337,INTRODUCTION.,impressions developed by means of study: not merely currents of thought
338,INTRODUCTION.,and feeling which I have singled out from the multifold life of the
339,INTRODUCTION.,"Renaissance; but currents of thought and feeling in myself, which have"
340,INTRODUCTION.,found and swept along with them certain items of Renaissance lore. For
341,INTRODUCTION.,"the Renaissance has been to me, in the small measure in which it has"
342,INTRODUCTION.,"been anything, not so much a series of studies as a series of"
343,INTRODUCTION.,impressions. I have not mastered the history and literature of the
344,INTRODUCTION.,"Renaissance (first-hand or second-hand, perfectly or imperfectly),"
345,INTRODUCTION.,"abstract and exact, and then sought out the places and things which"
346,INTRODUCTION.,could make that abstraction somewhat more concrete in my mind; I have
347,INTRODUCTION.,"seen the concrete things, and what I might call the concrete realities"
348,INTRODUCTION.,"of thought and feeling left behind by the Renaissance, and then tried to"
349,INTRODUCTION.,obtain from books some notion of the original shape and manner of
350,INTRODUCTION.,"wearing these relics, rags and tatters of a past civilization."
351,INTRODUCTION.,
352,INTRODUCTION.,"For Italy, beggared and maimed (by her own unthrift, by the rapacity of"
353,INTRODUCTION.,"others, by the order of Fate) at the beginning of the sixteenth century,"
354,INTRODUCTION.,"was never able to weave for herself a new, a modern civilization, as did"
355,INTRODUCTION.,"the nations who had shattered her looms on which such woofs are made,"
356,INTRODUCTION.,and carried off her earnings with which such things may be bought; and
357,INTRODUCTION.,"she had, accordingly, to go through life in the old garments, still half"
358,INTRODUCTION.,"mediæval in shape, which had been fashioned for her during the"
359,INTRODUCTION.,"Renaissance: apparel of the best that could then be made, beautiful and"
360,INTRODUCTION.,"strong in many ways, so beautiful and strong indeed as to impose on"
361,INTRODUCTION.,"people for a good long time, and make French, and Germans, and"
362,INTRODUCTION.,"Spaniards, and English believe (comparing these brilliant tissues with"
363,INTRODUCTION.,the homespun they were providing for themselves) that it must be all
364,INTRODUCTION.,"brand new, and of the very latest fashion. But the garments left to"
365,INTRODUCTION.,"Italy by those latest Middle Ages which we call Renaissance, were not"
366,INTRODUCTION.,"eternal: wear and tear, new occupations, and the rough usage of other"
367,INTRODUCTION.,"nations, rent them most sorely; their utter neglect by the long"
368,INTRODUCTION.,"seventeenth century, their hasty patchings up (with bits of odd stuff"
369,INTRODUCTION.,"and all manner of coloured thread and string, so that a harlequin's"
370,INTRODUCTION.,jacket could not look queerer) by the happy-go-lucky practicalness of
371,INTRODUCTION.,"the eighteenth century and the Revolution, reduced them thoroughly to"
372,INTRODUCTION.,"rags; and with these rags of Renaissance civilization, Italy may still"
373,INTRODUCTION.,"be seen to drape herself. Not perhaps in the great centres, where the"
374,INTRODUCTION.,"garments of modern civilization, economical, unpicturesque, intended to"
375,INTRODUCTION.,"be worn but a short time, have been imported from other countries; but"
376,INTRODUCTION.,"yet in many places. Yes, you may still see those rags of the Renaissance"
377,INTRODUCTION.,as plainly as you see the tattered linen fluttering from the twisted
378,INTRODUCTION.,iron hooks (made for the display of precious brocades and carpets on
379,INTRODUCTION.,"pageant days) which still remain in the stained whitewash, the seams of"
380,INTRODUCTION.,battered bricks of the solid old escutcheoned palaces; see them
381,INTRODUCTION.,sometimes displayed like the worm-eaten squares of discoloured
382,INTRODUCTION.,embroidery which the curiosity dealers take out of their musty oak
383,INTRODUCTION.,presses; and sometimes dragging about mere useless and befouled odds and
384,INTRODUCTION.,"ends, like the torn shreds which lie among the decaying kitchen refuse,"
385,INTRODUCTION.,"the broken tiles and plaster, the nameless filth and ooze which attracts"
386,INTRODUCTION.,"the flies under every black archway, in every steep bricked lane"
387,INTRODUCTION.,"descending precipitously between the high old houses. Old palaces,"
388,INTRODUCTION.,"almost strongholds, and which are still inhabited by those too poor to"
389,INTRODUCTION.,pull them down and build some plastered bandbox instead; poems and prose
390,INTRODUCTION.,"tales written or told five hundred years ago, edited and re-edited by"
391,INTRODUCTION.,printers to whom there come no modern poems or prose tales worth editing
392,INTRODUCTION.,"instead; half-pagan, mediæval priest lore, believed in by men and women"
393,INTRODUCTION.,"who have not been given anything to believe instead; easy-going,"
394,INTRODUCTION.,"all-permitting fifteenth century scepticism, not yet replaced by the"
395,INTRODUCTION.,scientific and socialistic disbelief which is puritanic and
396,INTRODUCTION.,iconoclastic; sly and savage habits of vengeance still doing service
397,INTRODUCTION.,among the lower classes instead of the orderly chicanery of modern
398,INTRODUCTION.,"justice;--these are the things, and a hundred others besides, concrete"
399,INTRODUCTION.,"and spiritual, things too magnificent, too sordid, too irregular, too"
400,INTRODUCTION.,"nauseous, too beautiful, and, above all, too utterly unpractical and"
401,INTRODUCTION.,"old-fashioned for our times, which I call the rags of the Renaissance,"
402,INTRODUCTION.,and with which Italy still ekes out her scanty apparel of modern
403,INTRODUCTION.,thoughts and things.
404,INTRODUCTION.,
405,INTRODUCTION.,"It is living among such things, turn by turn delighted by their beauty"
406,INTRODUCTION.,"and offended by their foulness, that one acquires the habit of spending"
407,INTRODUCTION.,"a part only of one's intellectual and moral life in the present, and the"
408,INTRODUCTION.,"rest in the past. Impressions are not derived from description, and"
409,INTRODUCTION.,thoughts are not suggested by books. The juxtaposition of concrete
410,INTRODUCTION.,objects invites the making of a theory as the jutting out of two
411,INTRODUCTION.,branches invites the spinning of a spider's web. You find everywhere
412,INTRODUCTION.,your facts without opening a book. The explanation which I have tried to
413,INTRODUCTION.,give of the exact manner in which mediæval art was influenced by the
414,INTRODUCTION.,"remains of antiquity, came like a flash during a rainy morning in the"
415,INTRODUCTION.,Pisan Campo Santo; the working out and testing of that explanation in
416,INTRODUCTION.,its details was a matter of going from one church or gallery to the
417,INTRODUCTION.,"other, a reference or two to Vasari for some date or fact being the only"
418,INTRODUCTION.,necessary reading; and should any one at this moment ask me for
419,INTRODUCTION.,"substantiation of that theory, instead of opening books I would take"
420,INTRODUCTION.,"that person to this Sienese Cathedral, and there bid him compare the"
421,INTRODUCTION.,"griffins and arabesques, the delicate figure and foliage ornaments"
422,INTRODUCTION.,"carved in wood and marble by the latter Middle Ages, with the griffins"
423,INTRODUCTION.,"and arabesques, the boldly bossed horsemen, the exquisite fruit garlands"
424,INTRODUCTION.,of a certain antique altar stone which the builders of the church used
425,INTRODUCTION.,"as a base to a pillar, and which must have been a never-ceasing-object"
426,INTRODUCTION.,of study to every draughtsman and stoneworker in Siena.
427,INTRODUCTION.,
428,INTRODUCTION.,Nor are such everywhere-scattered facts ready for working into theoretic
429,INTRODUCTION.,"shape, the most which Italy still affords to make the study of the"
430,INTRODUCTION.,Renaissance an almost involuntary habit. In certain places where only
431,INTRODUCTION.,"decay has altered things from what they were four centuries ago,"
432,INTRODUCTION.,"Perugia, Orvieto, S. Gimignano, in the older quarters of Florence,"
433,INTRODUCTION.,"Venice, and Verona, but nowhere I think so much as in this city of Siena"
434,INTRODUCTION.,(as purely mediæval as the suits of rusted armour which its townsfolk
435,INTRODUCTION.,"patch up and bury themselves in during their August pageants), we are"
436,INTRODUCTION.,subjected to receive impressions of the past so startlingly lifelike as
437,INTRODUCTION.,to get quite interwoven with our impressions of the present; and from
438,INTRODUCTION.,"that moment the past must share, in a measure, some of the everyday"
439,INTRODUCTION.,"thoughts which we give to the present. In such a city as this, the"
440,INTRODUCTION.,"sudden withdrawal, by sacristan or beggar-crone, of the curtain from"
441,INTRODUCTION.,before an altar-piece is many a time much more than the mere displaying
442,INTRODUCTION.,of a picture: it is the sudden bringing us face to face with the real
443,INTRODUCTION.,"life of the Renaissance. We have ourselves, perhaps not an hour before,"
444,INTRODUCTION.,sauntered through squares and dawdled beneath porticos like those which
445,INTRODUCTION.,"we see filled with the red-robed and plumed citizens and patricians, the"
446,INTRODUCTION.,Jews and ruffians whom Pinturicchio's parti-coloured men-at-arms are
447,INTRODUCTION.,dispersing to make room for the followers of Æneas Sylvius; or clambered
448,INTRODUCTION.,"up rough lanes, hedged in between oak woods and oliveyards, which we"
449,INTRODUCTION.,might almost swear were the very ones through which are winding Sodoma's
450,INTRODUCTION.,"cavalcades of gallantly dressed gentlemen, with their hawks and hounds,"
451,INTRODUCTION.,"and negro jesters and apes and beautiful pages, cantering along on"
452,INTRODUCTION.,"shortnecked little horses with silver bits and scarlet trappings, on the"
453,INTRODUCTION.,"pretence of being the Kings from the East, carrying gold and myrrh to"
454,INTRODUCTION.,"the infant Christ. It seems as if all were astoundingly real, as if, by"
455,INTRODUCTION.,"some magic, we were actually going to mix in the life of the past. But"
456,INTRODUCTION.,"it is in reality but a mere delusion, a deceit like those dioramas which"
457,INTRODUCTION.,"we have all been into as children, and where, by paying your shilling,"
458,INTRODUCTION.,"you were suddenly introduced into an oasis of the desert, or into a"
459,INTRODUCTION.,"recent battle-field: things which surprised us, real palm trunks and"
460,INTRODUCTION.,"Arabian water jars, or real fascines and cannon balls, lying about for"
461,INTRODUCTION.,"us to touch; roads opening on all sides into this simulated desert,"
462,INTRODUCTION.,through this simulated battle-field. So also with these seeming
463,INTRODUCTION.,realities of Renaissance life. We can touch the things scattered on the
464,INTRODUCTION.,"foreground, can handle the weapons, the furniture, the books and musical"
465,INTRODUCTION.,"instruments; we can see, or think we see, most plainly the streets and"
466,INTRODUCTION.,"paths, the faces and movements of that Renaissance world; but when we"
467,INTRODUCTION.,"try to penetrate into it, we shall find that there is but a slip of"
468,INTRODUCTION.,"solid ground beneath us, that all around us is but canvas and painted"
469,INTRODUCTION.,"wall, perspectived and lit up by our fancy; and that when we try to"
470,INTRODUCTION.,"approach to touch one of those seemingly so real men and women, our eyes"
471,INTRODUCTION.,"find only daubs of paint, our hands meet only flat and chilly stucco."
472,INTRODUCTION.,"Turn we to our books, and seek therein the spell whereby to make this"
473,INTRODUCTION.,"simulacrum real; and I think the plaster will still remain plaster, the"
474,INTRODUCTION.,"stones still remain stone. Out of the Renaissance, out of the Middle"
475,INTRODUCTION.,"Ages, we must never hope to evoke any spectres which can talk with us"
476,INTRODUCTION.,"and we with them; nothing of the kind of those dim but familiar ghosts,"
477,INTRODUCTION.,"often grotesque rather than heroic, who come to us from out of the"
478,INTRODUCTION.,"books, the daubed portraits of times nearer our own, and sit opposite"
479,INTRODUCTION.,"us, making us laugh, and also cry, with humdrum stories and humdrum woes"
480,INTRODUCTION.,so very like our own. No; such ghosts the Renaissance has not left
481,INTRODUCTION.,behind it. From out of it there come to us no familiars. They are all
482,INTRODUCTION.,faces--those which meet us in the pages of chronicles and in the frames
483,INTRODUCTION.,of pictures: they are painted records of the past--we may understand
484,INTRODUCTION.,"them by scanning well their features, but they cannot understand, they"
485,INTRODUCTION.,"cannot perceive us. Such, when all is said, are my impressions of the"
486,INTRODUCTION.,Renaissance. The moral atmosphere of those days is as impossible for us
487,INTRODUCTION.,"to breathe as would be the physical atmosphere of the moon: could we,"
488,INTRODUCTION.,"for a moment, penetrate into it, we should die of asphyxia. Say what we"
489,INTRODUCTION.,"may against both Protestant reformation and Catholic reaction, these two"
490,INTRODUCTION.,began to make an atmosphere (pure or foul) different from that of the
491,INTRODUCTION.,"Middle Ages and the Renaissance, an atmosphere in which lived creatures"
492,INTRODUCTION.,"like ourselves, into which ourselves might penetrate."
493,INTRODUCTION.,
494,INTRODUCTION.,"A crotchet this, perhaps, of my own; but it is my feeling, nevertheless."
495,INTRODUCTION.,"The Renaissance is, I say again, no period out of which we must try and"
496,INTRODUCTION.,evoke ghostly companions. Let us not waste our strength in seeking to do
497,INTRODUCTION.,"so; but be satisfied if it teaches us strange truths, scientific and"
498,INTRODUCTION.,"practical; if its brilliant and solemn personalities, its bright and"
499,INTRODUCTION.,"majestic art can give us pleasure; if its evils and wrongs, its"
500,INTRODUCTION.,"inevitable degradation, can move us to pity and to indignation."

509,THE SACRIFICE.,Ihr führt ins Leben uns hinein;
510,THE SACRIFICE.,Ihr lässt den armen schuldig werden;

512,THE SACRIFICE.,Denn alle Schuld rächt sich auf Erden.
513,THE SACRIFICE.,
514,THE SACRIFICE.,
515,THE SACRIFICE.,"At the end of the fifteenth century, Italy was the centre of European"
516,THE SACRIFICE.,civilization: while the other nations were still plunged in a feudal
517,THE SACRIFICE.,barbarism which seems almost as far removed from all our sympathies as
518,THE SACRIFICE.,"is the condition of some American or Polynesian savages, the Italians"
519,THE SACRIFICE.,"appear to us as possessing habits of thought, a mode of life, political,"
520,THE SACRIFICE.,"social, and literary institutions, not unlike those of to-day; as men"
521,THE SACRIFICE.,"whom we can thoroughly understand, whose ideas and aims, whose general"
522,THE SACRIFICE.,"views, resemble our own in that main, indefinable characteristic of"
523,THE SACRIFICE.,"being modern. They had shaken off the morbid monastic ways of feeling,"
524,THE SACRIFICE.,"they had thrown aside the crooked scholastic modes of thinking, they had"
525,THE SACRIFICE.,trampled under foot the feudal institutions of the Middle Ages; no
526,THE SACRIFICE.,"symbolical mists made them see things vague, strange, and distorted;"
527,THE SACRIFICE.,"their intellectual atmosphere was as clear as our own, and, if they saw"
528,THE SACRIFICE.,"less than we do, what they did see appeared to them in its true shape"
529,THE SACRIFICE.,and proportions. Almost for the first time since the ruin of antique
530,THE SACRIFICE.,"civilization, they could show well-organized, well-defined States;"
531,THE SACRIFICE.,artistically disciplined armies; rationally devised laws; scientifically
532,THE SACRIFICE.,"conducted agriculture; and widely extended, intelligently undertaken"
533,THE SACRIFICE.,"commerce. For the first time, also, they showed regularly built,"
534,THE SACRIFICE.,"healthy, and commodious towns; well-drained fields; and, more important"
535,THE SACRIFICE.,"than all, hundreds of miles of country owned not by feudal lords, but by"
536,THE SACRIFICE.,"citizens; cultivated not by serfs, but by free peasants. While in the"
537,THE SACRIFICE.,rest of Europe men were floundering among the stagnant ideas and
538,THE SACRIFICE.,"crumbling institutions of the effete Middle Ages, with but a vague"
539,THE SACRIFICE.,"half-consciousness of their own nature, the Italians walked calmly"
540,THE SACRIFICE.,"through a life as well arranged as their great towns, bold, inquisitive,"
541,THE SACRIFICE.,"and sceptical: modern administrators, modern soldiers, modern"
542,THE SACRIFICE.,"politicians, modern financiers, scholars, and thinkers. Towards the end"
543,THE SACRIFICE.,"of the fifteenth century, Italy seemed to have obtained the philosophic,"
544,THE SACRIFICE.,"literary, and artistic inheritance of Greece; the administrative, legal,"
545,THE SACRIFICE.,"and military inheritance of Rome, increased threefold by her own strong,"
546,THE SACRIFICE.,"original, essentially modern activities."
547,THE SACRIFICE.,
548,THE SACRIFICE.,"Yet, at that very time, and almost in proportion as all these advantages"
549,THE SACRIFICE.,"developed, the moral vitality of the Italians was rapidly decreasing,"
550,THE SACRIFICE.,and a horrible moral gangrene beginning to spread: liberty was
551,THE SACRIFICE.,extinguished; public good faith seemed to be dying out; even private
552,THE SACRIFICE.,morality flickered ominously; every free State became subject to a
553,THE SACRIFICE.,"despot, always unscrupulous and often infamous; warfare became a mere"
554,THE SACRIFICE.,pretext for the rapine and extortions of mercenaries; diplomacy grew to
555,THE SACRIFICE.,be a mere swindle; the humanists inoculated literature with the
556,THE SACRIFICE.,"filthiest refuse cast up by antiquity; nay, even civic and family ties"
557,THE SACRIFICE.,"were loosened; assassinations and fratricides began to abound, and all"
558,THE SACRIFICE.,"law, human and divine, to be set at defiance."
559,THE SACRIFICE.,
560,THE SACRIFICE.,The nations who came into contact with the Italians opened their eyes
561,THE SACRIFICE.,"with astonishment, with mingled admiration and terror; and we, people of"
562,THE SACRIFICE.,"the nineteenth century, are filled with the same feeling, only much"
563,THE SACRIFICE.,"stronger and more defined, as we watch the strange ebullition of the"
564,THE SACRIFICE.,"Renaissance, seething with good and evil, as we contemplate the"
565,THE SACRIFICE.,"enigmatic picture drawn by the puzzled historian, the picture of a"
566,THE SACRIFICE.,people moving on towards civilization and towards chaos. Our first
567,THE SACRIFICE.,"feeling is perplexity; our second feeling, anger; we do not at first"
568,THE SACRIFICE.,know whether we ought to believe in such an anomaly; when once we do
569,THE SACRIFICE.,"believe in it, we are indignant at its existence. We accuse these"
570,THE SACRIFICE.,Italians of the Renaissance of having wilfully and shamefully perverted
571,THE SACRIFICE.,"their own powers, of having wantonly corrupted their own civilization,"
572,THE SACRIFICE.,"of having cynically destroyed their own national existence, of having"
573,THE SACRIFICE.,"boldly called down the vengeance of Heaven; we lament and we accuse,"
574,THE SACRIFICE.,"naturally enough, but perhaps not justly."
575,THE SACRIFICE.,
576,THE SACRIFICE.,"Let us ask ourselves what the Renaissance really was, and what was its"
577,THE SACRIFICE.,"use; how it was produced, and how it necessarily ended. Let us try to"
578,THE SACRIFICE.,"understand its inherent nature, and the nature of what surrounded it,"
579,THE SACRIFICE.,"which, taken together, constitute its inevitable fate; let us seek the"
580,THE SACRIFICE.,"explanation of that strange, anomalous civilization, of that life in"
581,THE SACRIFICE.,"death, and death in life. The Renaissance, inasmuch as it is something"
582,THE SACRIFICE.,"which we can define, and not a mere vague name for a certain epoch, is"
583,THE SACRIFICE.,"not a period, but a condition; and if we apply the word to any period in"
584,THE SACRIFICE.,"particular, it is because in it that condition was peculiarly marked."
585,THE SACRIFICE.,
586,THE SACRIFICE.,The Renaissance may be defined as being that phase in mediæval history
587,THE SACRIFICE.,"in which the double influence, feudal and ecclesiastic, which had"
588,THE SACRIFICE.,"gradually crushed the spontaneous life of the early mediæval revival,"
589,THE SACRIFICE.,"and reduced all to a dead, sterile mass, was neutralized by the"
590,THE SACRIFICE.,"existence of democratic and secular communities; that phase in which,"
591,THE SACRIFICE.,"while there existed not yet any large nations, or any definite national"
592,THE SACRIFICE.,"feeling, there existed free towns and civic democracies. In this sense"
593,THE SACRIFICE.,"the Renaissance began to exist with the earliest mediæval revival, but"
594,THE SACRIFICE.,its peculiar mission could be carried out only when that general revival
595,THE SACRIFICE.,"had come to an end. In this sense, also, the Renaissance did not exist"
596,THE SACRIFICE.,"all over Italy, and it existed outside Italy; but in Italy it was far"
597,THE SACRIFICE.,"more universal than elsewhere: there it was the rule, elsewhere the"
598,THE SACRIFICE.,"exception. There was no Renaissance in Savoy, nor in Naples, nor even in"
599,THE SACRIFICE.,Rome; but north of the Alps there was Renaissance only in individual
600,THE SACRIFICE.,"towns like Nürnberg, Augsburg, Bruges, Ghent, &c. In the North the"
601,THE SACRIFICE.,Renaissance is dotted about amidst the stagnant Middle Ages; in Italy
602,THE SACRIFICE.,the Middle Ages intersect and interrupt the Renaissance here and there:
603,THE SACRIFICE.,the consequence was that in the North the Renaissance was crushed by the
604,THE SACRIFICE.,"Middle Ages, whereas in Italy the Middle Ages were crushed by the"
605,THE SACRIFICE.,"Renaissance. Wherever there was a free town, without direct dependence"
606,THE SACRIFICE.,"on feudal or ecclesiastical institutions, governed by its own citizens,"
607,THE SACRIFICE.,subsisting by its own industry and commerce; wherever the burghers built
608,THE SACRIFICE.,"walls, slung chains across their streets, and raised their own"
609,THE SACRIFICE.,"cathedral; wherever, be it in Germany, in Flanders, or in England, there"
610,THE SACRIFICE.,was a suspension of the deadly influences of the later Middle Ages;
611,THE SACRIFICE.,"there, to greater or less extent, was the Renaissance."
612,THE SACRIFICE.,
613,THE SACRIFICE.,But in the North this rudimentary Renaissance was never suffered to
614,THE SACRIFICE.,spread beyond the walls of single towns; it was hemmed in on all sides
615,THE SACRIFICE.,"by feudal and ecclesiastical institutions, which restrained it within"
616,THE SACRIFICE.,definite limits. The free towns of Germany were mostly dependent upon
617,THE SACRIFICE.,their bishops or archbishops; the more politically important cities of
618,THE SACRIFICE.,Flanders were under the suzerainty of a feudal family; they were subject
619,THE SACRIFICE.,"to constant vexations from their suzerains, and their very existence was"
620,THE SACRIFICE.,endangered by an attempt at independence; Liege was well-nigh destroyed
621,THE SACRIFICE.,"by the supporters of her bishop, and Ghent was ruined by the revenge of"
622,THE SACRIFICE.,"the Duke of Burgundy. In these northern cities, therefore, the"
623,THE SACRIFICE.,commonwealth was restricted to a sort of mercantile
624,THE SACRIFICE.,"corporation--powerful within the town, but powerless without it; while"
625,THE SACRIFICE.,"outside the town reigned feudalism, with its robber nobles, free"
626,THE SACRIFICE.,"companies, and bands of outlawed peasants, from whom the merchant"
627,THE SACRIFICE.,princes of Bruges and Nürnberg could scarcely protect their wares. To
628,THE SACRIFICE.,this political feebleness and narrowness corresponded an intellectual
629,THE SACRIFICE.,weakness and pettiness: the burghers were mere self-ruling tradesfolk;
630,THE SACRIFICE.,their interests did not extend far beyond their shops and their houses;
631,THE SACRIFICE.,"literature was cramped in guilds, and reflection and imagination were"
632,THE SACRIFICE.,confined within the narrow limits of town life. Everything was on a
633,THE SACRIFICE.,"small scale; the Renaissance was moderate and inefficient, running no"
634,THE SACRIFICE.,great dangers and achieving no great conquests. There was not enough
635,THE SACRIFICE.,"action to produce reaction; and, while the Italian free States were"
636,THE SACRIFICE.,"ground down by foreign tyrannies, the German and Flemish cities"
637,THE SACRIFICE.,insensibly merged into the vast empire of the House of Austria. While
638,THE SACRIFICE.,also the Italians of the sixteenth century rushed into moral and
639,THE SACRIFICE.,"religious confusion, which only Jesuitism could discipline, the Germans"
640,THE SACRIFICE.,of the same time quietly and comfortably adopted the Reformation.
641,THE SACRIFICE.,
642,THE SACRIFICE.,"The main cause of this difference, the main explanation of the fact that"
643,THE SACRIFICE.,"while in the North the Renaissance was cramped and enfeebled, in Italy"
644,THE SACRIFICE.,"it carried everything before it, lies in the circumstance that feudalism"
645,THE SACRIFICE.,"never took deep root in Italy. The conquered Latin race was enfeebled,"
646,THE SACRIFICE.,"it is true, but it was far more civilized than the conquering Teutonic"
647,THE SACRIFICE.,"peoples; the Barbarians came down, not on to a previous layer of"
648,THE SACRIFICE.,"Barbarians, but on to a deep layer of civilized men; the nomads of the"
649,THE SACRIFICE.,"North found in Italy a people weakened and corrupt, but with a long and"
650,THE SACRIFICE.,"inextinguishable habit of independence, of order, of industry. The"
651,THE SACRIFICE.,"country had been cultivated for centuries, the Barbarians could not turn"
652,THE SACRIFICE.,it into a desert; the inhabitants had been organized as citizens for a
653,THE SACRIFICE.,"thousand years, the Barbarians could not reorganize them feudally. The"
654,THE SACRIFICE.,"Barbarians who settled in Italy, especially the latest of them, the"
655,THE SACRIFICE.,"Lombards, were not only in a minority, but at an immense disadvantage."
656,THE SACRIFICE.,"They founded kingdoms and dukedoms, where German was spoken and German"
657,THE SACRIFICE.,laws were enacted; but whenever they tried to communicate with their
658,THE SACRIFICE.,"Italian subjects, they found themselves forced to adopt the Latin"
659,THE SACRIFICE.,"language, manners, and laws; their domination became real only in"
660,THE SACRIFICE.,"proportion as it ceased to be Teutonic, and the Barbarian element was"
661,THE SACRIFICE.,swallowed up by what remained of Roman civilization. Little by little
662,THE SACRIFICE.,"these Lombard monarchies, without roots in the soil, and surrounded by"
663,THE SACRIFICE.,"hostile influences, died out, and there remained of the invaders only a"
664,THE SACRIFICE.,"certain number of nobles, those whose descendants were to bear the"
665,THE SACRIFICE.,"originally German names of Gherardesca, Rolandinghi, Soffredinghi,"
666,THE SACRIFICE.,"Lambertazzi, Guidi, and whose suzerains were the Bavarian and Swabian"
667,THE SACRIFICE.,dukes and marquises of Tuscan. Meanwhile the Latin element revived;
668,THE SACRIFICE.,towns were rebuilt; a new Latin language was formed; and the burghers of
669,THE SACRIFICE.,these young communities gradually wrested franchises and privileges from
670,THE SACRIFICE.,"the weak Teutonic rulers, who required Italian agriculture, industry,"
671,THE SACRIFICE.,"and commerce, without which they and their feudal retainers would have"
672,THE SACRIFICE.,starved. Feudalism became speedily limited to the hilly country; the
673,THE SACRIFICE.,plain became the property of the cities which it surrounded; the nobles
674,THE SACRIFICE.,"turned into mere robber chieftains, then into mercenary soldiers, and"
675,THE SACRIFICE.,"finally, as the towns gained importance, they gradually descended into"
676,THE SACRIFICE.,the cities and begged admission into the guilds of artizans and
677,THE SACRIFICE.,tradesfolk. Thus they grew into citizens and Italians; but for a long
678,THE SACRIFICE.,"time they kept hankering after feudalism, and looking towards the German"
679,THE SACRIFICE.,emperors who claimed the inheritance of the Lombard kings. The struggle
680,THE SACRIFICE.,"between Guelphs and Ghibellines, between the German feudal element and"
681,THE SACRIFICE.,"the Latin civic one, ended in the complete annihilation of the former in"
682,THE SACRIFICE.,all the north and centre of Italy. The nobles sank definitely into
683,THE SACRIFICE.,"merchants, and those who persisted in keeping their castles were"
684,THE SACRIFICE.,speedily ousted by the commissaries of the free towns. Such is the
685,THE SACRIFICE.,history of feudalism in Italy--the history of Barbarian minority
686,THE SACRIFICE.,engulphed in Latin civilization; of Teutonic counts and dukes turned
687,THE SACRIFICE.,"into robber nobles, hunted into the hills by the townsfolk, and finally"
688,THE SACRIFICE.,seeking admission into the guilds of wool-spinners or money-changers;
689,THE SACRIFICE.,and in it is the main explanation of the fact that the Italian
690,THE SACRIFICE.,"republics, instead of remaining restricted within their city walls like"
691,THE SACRIFICE.,"those of the North, spread over whole provinces, and became real"
692,THE SACRIFICE.,politically organized States. And in such States having a free
693,THE SACRIFICE.,"political, military, and commercial life, uncramped by ecclesiastic or"
694,THE SACRIFICE.,"feudal influence, in them alone could the great revival of human"
695,THE SACRIFICE.,intelligence and character thoroughly succeed. The commune was the only
696,THE SACRIFICE.,"species of free government possible during the Middle Ages, the only"
697,THE SACRIFICE.,form which could resist that utterly prostrating action of later
698,THE SACRIFICE.,mediævalism. Feudalism stamped out civilization; monasticism warped it;
699,THE SACRIFICE.,"in the open country it was burnt, trampled on, and uprooted; in the"
700,THE SACRIFICE.,cloister it withered and shrank and perished; only within the walls of a
701,THE SACRIFICE.,"city, protected from the storm without, and yet in the fresh atmosphere"
702,THE SACRIFICE.,"of life, could it develope, flourish, and bear fruit."
703,THE SACRIFICE.,
704,THE SACRIFICE.,"But this system of the free town contained in itself, as does every"
705,THE SACRIFICE.,"other institution, the seed of death--contained it in that expanding"
706,THE SACRIFICE.,"element which developes, ripens, rots, and finally dissolves all living"
707,THE SACRIFICE.,"organisms. A little town is formed in the midst of some feudal state, as"
708,THE SACRIFICE.,"Pisa, Florence, Lucca, and Bologna were formed in the dominions of the"
709,THE SACRIFICE.,lords of Tuscany; the _elders_ govern it; it is protected from without;
710,THE SACRIFICE.,"it obtains privileges from its suzerain, always glad to oppose anything"
711,THE SACRIFICE.,"to his vassals, and who, unlike them, is too far removed in the feudal"
712,THE SACRIFICE.,"scale to injure the commune, which is under his supreme jurisdiction but"
713,THE SACRIFICE.,"not in his land. The town can thus develope regularly, governing itself,"
714,THE SACRIFICE.,"taxing itself, defending itself against encroaching neighbours; it"
715,THE SACRIFICE.,"gradually extends beyond its own walls, liberates its peasantry, extends"
716,THE SACRIFICE.,"its commerce, extinguishes feudalism, beats back its suzerain or buys"
717,THE SACRIFICE.,"privileges from him; in short, lives the vigorous young life of the"
718,THE SACRIFICE.,early Italian commonwealths. But now the danger begins. The original
719,THE SACRIFICE.,"system of government, where every head of a family is a power in the"
720,THE SACRIFICE.,"State, where every man helps to govern, without representation or"
721,THE SACRIFICE.,"substitution, could exist only as long as the commune remained small"
722,THE SACRIFICE.,enough for the individual to be in proportion with it; as long as the
723,THE SACRIFICE.,State remained small enough for all its citizens to assemble in the
724,THE SACRIFICE.,"market-place and vote, for every man to know every detail of the"
725,THE SACRIFICE.,"administration, every inch of the land. When the limits were extended,"
726,THE SACRIFICE.,the burgher had to deal with towns and villages and men and things which
727,THE SACRIFICE.,"he did not know, and which he probably hated, as every small community"
728,THE SACRIFICE.,"hated its neighbour; witness the horrible war, lasting centuries,"
729,THE SACRIFICE.,between the two little towns of Dinant and Bouvines on the Meuse. Still
730,THE SACRIFICE.,more was this the case with an important city: the subjugated town was
731,THE SACRIFICE.,"hated all the more for being a rival centre; the burghers of Florence,"
732,THE SACRIFICE.,"inspired only by their narrow town interest, treated Pisa according to"
733,THE SACRIFICE.,"its dictates, that is, tried to stamp it out. Thence the victorious"
734,THE SACRIFICE.,"communes came to be surrounded by conquered communes, which they dared"
735,THE SACRIFICE.,"not trust with any degree of power; and which, instead of being so many"
736,THE SACRIFICE.,"allies in case of invasion, were merely focuses of revolt, or at best"
737,THE SACRIFICE.,"inert impediments. Similarly, when the communes enlarged, and found it"
738,THE SACRIFICE.,"indispensable to delegate special men, who could attend to political"
739,THE SACRIFICE.,"matters more thoroughly than the other citizens, they were constantly"
740,THE SACRIFICE.,"falling under the tyranny of their _captains of the people_, of their"
741,THE SACRIFICE.,"_gonfalonieri_, and of all other heads of the State; or else, as in"
742,THE SACRIFICE.,"Florence, they were frightened by this continual danger into a system of"
743,THE SACRIFICE.,"perpetual interference with the executive, which was thus rendered"
744,THE SACRIFICE.,"well-nigh helpless. To this rule Venice forms the only exception, on"
745,THE SACRIFICE.,account of her exceptional position and history: the earliest burghers
746,THE SACRIFICE.,"turning into an intensely conservative and civic aristocracy, while"
747,THE SACRIFICE.,"everywhere else the feudal nobles turned into petty burghers, entirely"
748,THE SACRIFICE.,subversive of communal interests. Venice had the yet greater safeguard
749,THE SACRIFICE.,of being protected both from her victorious enemies and her own
750,THE SACRIFICE.,"victorious generals; who, however powerful on the mainland, could not"
751,THE SACRIFICE.,"seriously endanger the city itself, which thus remained a centre of"
752,THE SACRIFICE.,"reorganization in time of disaster. In this Venice was entirely unique,"
753,THE SACRIFICE.,as she was unique in the duration of her institutions and independence.
754,THE SACRIFICE.,"In the other towns of Italy, where there existed no naturally governing"
755,THE SACRIFICE.,"family or class, where every citizen had an equal share in government,"
756,THE SACRIFICE.,"and there existed no distinction save that of wealth and influence,"
757,THE SACRIFICE.,there was a constant tendency to the illegitimate preponderance of every
758,THE SACRIFICE.,"man or every family that rose above the average; and in a democratic,"
759,THE SACRIFICE.,"mercantile State, not a day passed without some such elevation. In a"
760,THE SACRIFICE.,"systematic, consolidated State, where the power is in the hands of a"
761,THE SACRIFICE.,"hereditary sovereign or aristocracy, a rich merchant remains a rich"
762,THE SACRIFICE.,"merchant, a victorious general remains a victorious general, an eloquent"
763,THE SACRIFICE.,"orator remains an eloquent orator; but in a shapeless, flunctuating"
764,THE SACRIFICE.,"democracy like those of Italy, the man who has influence over his"
765,THE SACRIFICE.,"fellow-citizens, whether by his money, his soldiers, or his eloquence,"
766,THE SACRIFICE.,necessarily becomes the head of the State; everything is free and
767,THE SACRIFICE.,"unoccupied, only a little superior strength is required to push into it."
768,THE SACRIFICE.,"Cosimo de' Medici has many clients, many correspondents, many debtors;"
769,THE SACRIFICE.,he can bind people by pecuniary obligations: he becomes prince. Sforza
770,THE SACRIFICE.,"has a victorious army, whom he can either hound on to the city or"
771,THE SACRIFICE.,restrain into a protection of its interests: he becomes prince.
772,THE SACRIFICE.,Savonarola has eloquence that makes the virtuous start up and the wicked
773,THE SACRIFICE.,tremble: he becomes prince. The history of the Italian commonwealths
774,THE SACRIFICE.,"shows us but one thing: the people, the only legal possessors of"
775,THE SACRIFICE.,"political power, giving it over to their bankers (Medici, Pepoli); to"
776,THE SACRIFICE.,"their generals (Della Torre, Visconti, Scaligeri); to their monkish"
777,THE SACRIFICE.,"reformers (Fra Bussolaro, Fra Giovanni da Vincenza, Savonarola). Here"
778,THE SACRIFICE.,"then we have the occasional but inevitable usurpers, who either"
779,THE SACRIFICE.,momentarily or finally disorganize the State. But this is not all. In
780,THE SACRIFICE.,"such a State every family hate, every mercantile hostility, means a"
781,THE SACRIFICE.,"corresponding political division. The guilds are sure to be rivals, the"
782,THE SACRIFICE.,larger wishing to exclude the smaller from government: the lower working
783,THE SACRIFICE.,classes (the _ciompi_ of Florence) wish to upset the guilds completely;
784,THE SACRIFICE.,the once feudal nobles wish to get back military power; the burghers
785,THE SACRIFICE.,wish entirely to extirpate the feudal nobles; the older families wish to
786,THE SACRIFICE.,"limit the Government, the newer prefer democracy and Cæsarism. Add to"
787,THE SACRIFICE.,"this the complications of private interests, the personal jealousies and"
788,THE SACRIFICE.,"aversions, the private warfare, inevitable in a town where legal justice"
789,THE SACRIFICE.,"is not always to be had, while forcible retaliation is always within"
790,THE SACRIFICE.,"reach; and the result is constant party spirit, insults, scuffles,"
791,THE SACRIFICE.,"conspiracies: the feudal nobles build towers in the streets, the"
792,THE SACRIFICE.,burghers pull them down; the lower artizans set fire to the warehouses
793,THE SACRIFICE.,"of the guilds, the magistrates take part in the contest; blood is spilt,"
794,THE SACRIFICE.,"magistrates are beheaded or thrown out of windows, a foreign State is"
795,THE SACRIFICE.,"entreated to interfere, and a number of citizens are banished by the"
796,THE SACRIFICE.,victorious party. This latter result creates a new and terrible danger
797,THE SACRIFICE.,"for the State, in the persons of so many exiles, ready to do anything,"
798,THE SACRIFICE.,"to join with any one, in order to return to the city and drive out their"
799,THE SACRIFICE.,enemies in their turn. The end of such constant upheavings is that the
800,THE SACRIFICE.,"whole population is disarmed, no party suffering its rival to have any"
801,THE SACRIFICE.,"means of offence or defence. Moreover, as industry and commerce"
802,THE SACRIFICE.,"develope, the citizens become unwilling to fight, while on the other"
803,THE SACRIFICE.,"hand the invention of firearms, subverting the whole system of warfare,"
804,THE SACRIFICE.,renders special military training more and more necessary. In the days
805,THE SACRIFICE.,"of the Lombard League, of Campaldino and Montaperti, the citizens could"
806,THE SACRIFICE.,"fight, hand to hand, round their _carroccio_ or banner, without much"
807,THE SACRIFICE.,discipline being required; but when it came to fortifying towns against
808,THE SACRIFICE.,"cannon, to drilling bodies of heavily armed cavalry, acting by the mere"
809,THE SACRIFICE.,"dexterity of their movements; when war became a science and an art, then"
810,THE SACRIFICE.,"the citizen had necessarily to be left out, and adventurers and poor"
811,THE SACRIFICE.,"nobles had to form armies of mercenaries, making warfare their sole"
812,THE SACRIFICE.,"profession. This system of mercenary troops, so bitterly inveighed"
813,THE SACRIFICE.,"against by Machiavelli (who, of course, entirely overlooked its"
814,THE SACRIFICE.,"inevitable origin and viewed it as a voluntarily incurred pest), added"
815,THE SACRIFICE.,"yet another and, perhaps, the very worst danger to civil liberty. It"
816,THE SACRIFICE.,"gave enormous, irresistible power to adventurers unscrupulous by nature"
817,THE SACRIFICE.,"and lawless by education, the sole object of whose career it became to"
818,THE SACRIFICE.,"obtain possession of States; by no means a difficult enterprise,"
819,THE SACRIFICE.,considering that they and their fellows were the sole possessors of
820,THE SACRIFICE.,"military force in the country. At the same time, this system of"
821,THE SACRIFICE.,mercenaries perfected the condition of utter defencelessness in which
822,THE SACRIFICE.,"the gradual subjection of rival cities, the violent party spirit, and"
823,THE SACRIFICE.,"the general disarming of the burghers, had placed the great Italian"
824,THE SACRIFICE.,"cities. For these troops, being wholly indifferent as to the cause for"
825,THE SACRIFICE.,"which they were fighting, turned war into the merest game of"
826,THE SACRIFICE.,dodges--half-a-dozen men being killed at a great battle like that of
827,THE SACRIFICE.,Anghiari--and they at the same time protracted campaigns beyond every
828,THE SACRIFICE.,"limit, without any decisive action taking place. The result of all these"
829,THE SACRIFICE.,"inevitable causes of ruin, was that most of the commonwealths fell into"
830,THE SACRIFICE.,the hands of despots; while those that did not were paralyzed by
831,THE SACRIFICE.,"interior factions, by a number of rebellious subject towns, and by"
832,THE SACRIFICE.,"generals who, even if they did not absolutely betray their employers,"
833,THE SACRIFICE.,never efficiently served them.
834,THE SACRIFICE.,
835,THE SACRIFICE.,"Such a condition of civic disorder lasted throughout the Middle Ages,"
836,THE SACRIFICE.,"until the end of the fifteenth century, without any further evils"
837,THE SACRIFICE.,"arising from it. The Italians made endless wars with each other,"
838,THE SACRIFICE.,"conquered each other, changed their government without end, fell into"
839,THE SACRIFICE.,the power of tyrants; but throughout these changes their civilization
840,THE SACRIFICE.,"developed unimpeded; because, although one of the centres of national"
841,THE SACRIFICE.,"life might be momentarily crushed, the others remained in activity, and"
842,THE SACRIFICE.,"infused vitality even into the feeble one, which would otherwise have"
843,THE SACRIFICE.,perished. All these ups and downs seemed but to stir the life in the
844,THE SACRIFICE.,"country: and no vital danger appeared to threaten it; nor did any, so"
845,THE SACRIFICE.,"long as the surrounding countries--France, Germany, and Spain--remained"
846,THE SACRIFICE.,"mere vast feudal nebulae, formless, weightless, immovable. The Italians"
847,THE SACRIFICE.,feared nothing from them; they would call down the King of France or the
848,THE SACRIFICE.,"Emperor of Germany without a moment's hesitation, because they knew that"
849,THE SACRIFICE.,"the king could not bring France, nor the emperor bring Germany, but only"
850,THE SACRIFICE.,"a few miserable, hungry retainers with him; but Florence would watch the"
851,THE SACRIFICE.,"growth of the petty State of the Scaligers, and Venice look with terror"
852,THE SACRIFICE.,"at the Duke of Milan, because they knew that _there_ there was"
853,THE SACRIFICE.,"concentrated life, and an organization which could be wielded as'"
854,THE SACRIFICE.,perfectly as a sword by the head of the State. In the last decade of the
855,THE SACRIFICE.,fifteenth century the Italians called in the French to put down their
856,THE SACRIFICE.,private enemies: Lodovico of Milan called down Charles VIII. to rid him
857,THE SACRIFICE.,of his nephew and of the Venetians; the Venetians to rid them of
858,THE SACRIFICE.,Lodovico: the Medici to establish them firmly in Florence; the party of
859,THE SACRIFICE.,freedom to drive out the Medici. Each State intended to use the French
860,THE SACRIFICE.,"to serve their purpose, and then to send back Charles VIII. with a"
861,THE SACRIFICE.,"little money and a great deal of derision, as they had done with kings"
862,THE SACRIFICE.,and emperors of earlier days. But Italian politicians suddenly
863,THE SACRIFICE.,discovered that they had made a fatal mistake; that they had reckoned in
864,THE SACRIFICE.,"ignorance, and that instead of an army they had called down a nation:"
865,THE SACRIFICE.,"for during the interval since their last appeal to foreign interference,"
866,THE SACRIFICE.,that great movement had taken place which had consolidated the
867,THE SACRIFICE.,heterogeneous feudal nebulae into homogeneous and compact kingdoms.
868,THE SACRIFICE.,
869,THE SACRIFICE.,"Single small States, relying upon mercenary troops, could not for a"
870,THE SACRIFICE.,moment resist the shock of such an agglomeration of soldiery as that of
871,THE SACRIFICE.,"the French, and of their successors the Spaniards and Germans. Sismondi"
872,THE SACRIFICE.,"asks indignantly, Why did the Italians not form a federation as soon as"
873,THE SACRIFICE.,"the strangers appeared? He might as well ask, Why did the commonwealths"
874,THE SACRIFICE.,not turn into a modern monarchy? The habit of security from abroad and
875,THE SACRIFICE.,of jealousy within; the essential nature of a number of rival trading
876,THE SACRIFICE.,"centres, made such a thing not only impossible of execution, but for a"
877,THE SACRIFICE.,while impossible of conception; confederacies had become possible only
878,THE SACRIFICE.,when Burlamacchi was decapitated by the imperialists; popular resistance
879,THE SACRIFICE.,had become a reality only when Feruccio was massacred by the Spaniards;
880,THE SACRIFICE.,a change of national institutions was feasible only when all national
881,THE SACRIFICE.,"institutions had been destroyed; when the Italians, having recognized"
882,THE SACRIFICE.,"the irresistible force of their adversaries, had ceased to form"
883,THE SACRIFICE.,independent States and larger and smaller guilds; when all the
884,THE SACRIFICE.,"characteristics of Italian civilization had been destroyed; when, in"
885,THE SACRIFICE.,"short, it was too late to do anything save theorize with Machiavelli and"
886,THE SACRIFICE.,Guicciardini as to what ought to have been done. We must not hastily
887,THE SACRIFICE.,accuse the volition of the Italians of the Renaissance; they may have
888,THE SACRIFICE.,"been egotistic and timid, but had they been (as some most certainly"
889,THE SACRIFICE.,"were) heroic and self-sacrificing to the utmost degree, they could not"
890,THE SACRIFICE.,have averted the catastrophe. The nature of their civilization prevented
891,THE SACRIFICE.,"not only their averting the peril, but even their conceiving its"
892,THE SACRIFICE.,existence; the very nature of their political forms necessitated such a
893,THE SACRIFICE.,dissolution of them. The commune grows from within; it is a little speck
894,THE SACRIFICE.,"which gradually extends its circumference, and the further this may be"
895,THE SACRIFICE.,"from the original centre, the less do its parts coalesce. The modern"
896,THE SACRIFICE.,"monarchy grows from external pressure, and towards the centre; it is a"
897,THE SACRIFICE.,"huge mass consolidating into a hard, distinct shape. Thence it follows"
898,THE SACRIFICE.,"that the more the commonwealth developes, the weaker it grows, because"
899,THE SACRIFICE.,its tendency is to spread and fall to pieces; whereas the more the
900,THE SACRIFICE.,"monarchy developes, the stronger it becomes, because it fills up towards"
901,THE SACRIFICE.,"the centre, and becomes more vigorously knit together. The city ceases"
902,THE SACRIFICE.,to be a city when extended over hundreds of miles; the nation becomes
903,THE SACRIFICE.,all the more a nation for being compressed towards a central point.
904,THE SACRIFICE.,
905,THE SACRIFICE.,The entire political collapse of Italy in the sixteenth century was not
906,THE SACRIFICE.,"only inevitable, from the essential nature of the civilization of the"
907,THE SACRIFICE.,"Renaissance, but it was also indispensable in order that this"
908,THE SACRIFICE.,civilization might fulfil its mission. Civilization cannot spread so
909,THE SACRIFICE.,"long as it is contained within a national mould, and only a vanquished"
910,THE SACRIFICE.,nation can civilize its victors. The Greece of Pericles could not
911,THE SACRIFICE.,"Hellenize Rome, but the Greece of the weak successors of Alexander"
912,THE SACRIFICE.,could; the Rome of Cæsar did not Romanize the Teutonic races as did the
913,THE SACRIFICE.,Rome of Theodosius; no amount of colonizing among the vanquished can
914,THE SACRIFICE.,"ever produce the effect of a victorious army, of a whole nation,"
915,THE SACRIFICE.,suddenly finding itself in the midst of the superior civilization of a
916,THE SACRIFICE.,conquered people. Michelet may well call the campaign of Charles VIII.
917,THE SACRIFICE.,the discovery of Italy. His imaginative mind seized at once the vast
918,THE SACRIFICE.,"importance of this descent of the French into Italy, which other"
919,THE SACRIFICE.,historians have been too prone to view in the same light as any other
920,THE SACRIFICE.,"invasion. It is from this moment that dates the _modernisation_, if we"
921,THE SACRIFICE.,"may so express ourselves, of the North. The barbarous soldiers of Gaston"
922,THE SACRIFICE.,"de Foix, of Frundsberg, and of Gonsalvo, were the unconscious bearers of"
923,THE SACRIFICE.,"the seeds of the ages of Elizabeth, of Louis XIV., and of Goethe. These"
924,THE SACRIFICE.,"stupid and rapacious ruffians, while they wantonly destroyed the works"
925,THE SACRIFICE.,"of Italian civilization, rendered possible the existence of a Montaigne,"
926,THE SACRIFICE.,"a Shakespeare, and a Cervantes."
927,THE SACRIFICE.,
928,THE SACRIFICE.,"Italy was as a vast store-house, sheltered from all the dangers of"
929,THE SACRIFICE.,"mediæval destruction; in which, while all other nations were blindly and"
930,THE SACRIFICE.,"fiercely working out their national existence, the inheritance of"
931,THE SACRIFICE.,Antiquity and the produce of the earliest modern civilization had been
932,THE SACRIFICE.,"peaceably garnered up. When the store-house was full, its gates had to"
933,THE SACRIFICE.,be torn open and its riches plundered and disseminated by the
934,THE SACRIFICE.,intellectual starvelings of the North; thus only could the rest of
935,THE SACRIFICE.,"mankind feed on these riches, regain and develope their mental life."
936,THE SACRIFICE.,
937,THE SACRIFICE.,What were those intellectual riches of the Renaissance? What was that
938,THE SACRIFICE.,strong intellectual food which revived the energies and enriched the
939,THE SACRIFICE.,blood of the Barbarians of the sixteenth century? The Renaissance
940,THE SACRIFICE.,"possessed the germs of every modern thing, and much that was far more"
941,THE SACRIFICE.,"than a mere germ: it possessed the habit of equality before the law, of"
942,THE SACRIFICE.,"civic organization, of industry and commerce developed to immense and"
943,THE SACRIFICE.,"superb proportions. It possessed science, literature, and art; above"
944,THE SACRIFICE.,"all, that which at once produced and was produced by all these--thorough"
945,THE SACRIFICE.,"perception of what exists, thorough consciousness of our own freedom and"
946,THE SACRIFICE.,"powers: self-cognizance. In Italy there was intellectual light, enabling"
947,THE SACRIFICE.,"men to see and judge all around them, enabling them to act wittingly and"
948,THE SACRIFICE.,deliberately. In this lies the immense greatness of the Renaissance; to
949,THE SACRIFICE.,"this are due all its achievements in literature and science, and, above"
950,THE SACRIFICE.,"all, in art: that, for the first time since the dissolution of antique"
951,THE SACRIFICE.,"civilization, men were free agents, both in thought and in deed; that"
952,THE SACRIFICE.,"there was an end of that palsying slavery of the Middle Ages, slavery of"
953,THE SACRIFICE.,"body and of mind, slavery to stultified ideas and effete forms, which"
954,THE SACRIFICE.,made men endure every degree of evil and believe every degree of
955,THE SACRIFICE.,"absurdity. For the first time since Antiquity, man walks free of all"
956,THE SACRIFICE.,"political and intellectual trammels, erect, conscious of his own"
957,THE SACRIFICE.,"thoughts, master of his own actions; ready to seek for truth across the"
958,THE SACRIFICE.,"ocean like Columbus, or across the heavens like Copernicus; to seek it"
959,THE SACRIFICE.,"in criticism and analysis like Machiavelli or Guicciardini, boldly to"
960,THE SACRIFICE.,"reproduce it in its highest, widest sense like Michael Angelo and"
961,THE SACRIFICE.,Raphael.
962,THE SACRIFICE.,
963,THE SACRIFICE.,The men of the Renaissance had to pay a heavy price for this
964,THE SACRIFICE.,intellectual freedom and self-cognizance which they not only enjoyed
965,THE SACRIFICE.,"themselves, but transmitted to the rest of the world; the price was the"
966,THE SACRIFICE.,"loss of all moral standard, of all fixed public feeling. They had thrown"
967,THE SACRIFICE.,"aside all accepted rules and criteria, they had cast away all faith in"
968,THE SACRIFICE.,"traditional institutions, they had destroyed, and could not yet rebuild."
969,THE SACRIFICE.,In their instinctive and universal disbelief in all that had been taught
970,THE SACRIFICE.,"them, they lost all respect for opinion, for rule, for what had been"
971,THE SACRIFICE.,called right and wrong. Could it be otherwise? Had they not discovered
972,THE SACRIFICE.,"that what had been called right had often been unnatural, and what had"
973,THE SACRIFICE.,"been called wrong often natural? Moral teachings, remonstrances, and"
974,THE SACRIFICE.,judgments belonged to that dogmatism from which they had broken loose;
975,THE SACRIFICE.,to those schools and churches where the foolish and the unnatural had
976,THE SACRIFICE.,been taught and worshipped; to those priests and monks who themselves
977,THE SACRIFICE.,most shamefully violated their teachings. To profess morality was to be
978,THE SACRIFICE.,a hypocrite; to reprobate others was to be narrow-minded. There was so
979,THE SACRIFICE.,much error mixed up with truth that truth had to share the discredit of
980,THE SACRIFICE.,error; so many innocent things had been denounced as sins that sinful
981,THE SACRIFICE.,ones at length ceased to be reprobated; people had so often found
982,THE SACRIFICE.,"themselves sympathizing with supposed criminals, that they soon lost"
983,THE SACRIFICE.,their horror of real ones. Damnation came to be disassociated from moral
984,THE SACRIFICE.,"indignation: it was the retribution, not of the unnatural and immoral,"
985,THE SACRIFICE.,but of the unlawful; and unlawful with respect to a law made without
986,THE SACRIFICE.,reference to reason and instinct. As reason and instinct were thus set
987,THE SACRIFICE.,"at defiance, but could not be silenced, the law was soon acquiesced in"
988,THE SACRIFICE.,"without being morally supported; thus, little by little, moral feeling"
989,THE SACRIFICE.,became warped. This was already the case in Dante's day. Farinata is
990,THE SACRIFICE.,"condemned to the most horrible punishment, which to Dante seems just,"
991,THE SACRIFICE.,because in accordance with an accepted code; yet Dante cannot but admire
992,THE SACRIFICE.,"him and cannot really hate him, for there is nothing in him to hate; he"
993,THE SACRIFICE.,is a criminal and yet respected--fatal combination! Dante punishes
994,THE SACRIFICE.,"Francesca, Pier delle Vigne, and Brunetto Latini, but he shows no"
995,THE SACRIFICE.,personal horror of them; in the one case his moral instinct refrains
996,THE SACRIFICE.,"from censuring the comparatively innocent, in the other it has ceased to"
997,THE SACRIFICE.,"revolt from the really infamous. Where Dante does feel real indignation,"
998,THE SACRIFICE.,"is most often in cases unprovided for by the religious codes, as with"
999,THE SACRIFICE.,"those low, grovelling, timid natures (the very same with whom"
1000,THE SACRIFICE.,"Machiavelli, the admirer of great villains, fairly loses patience),"
1001,THE SACRIFICE.,"those creatures whom Dante personally despises, whom he punishes with"
1002,THE SACRIFICE.,"filthy devices of his own, whom he passes by with words such as he never"
1003,THE SACRIFICE.,"addresses to Semiramis, Brutus, or Capaneus. This toleration of vice,"
1004,THE SACRIFICE.,"while acquiescing in its legal punishment, increased in proportion to"
1005,THE SACRIFICE.,"the development of individual judgment, and did not cease till all the"
1006,THE SACRIFICE.,theories of the lawful and unlawful had been so completely demolished as
1007,THE SACRIFICE.,to permit of their being rebuilt on solid bases.
1008,THE SACRIFICE.,
1009,THE SACRIFICE.,This work of demolition had not yet ceased in the beginning of the
1010,THE SACRIFICE.,sixteenth century; and the moral confusion due to it was increased by
1011,THE SACRIFICE.,various causes dependent on political and other circumstances. The
1012,THE SACRIFICE.,despots in whose hands it was the inevitable fate of the various
1013,THE SACRIFICE.,"commonwealths to fall, were by their very position immoral in all their"
1014,THE SACRIFICE.,"dealings: violent, fraudulent, suspicious, and, from their life of"
1015,THE SACRIFICE.,"constant unnatural tension of the feelings, prone to every species of"
1016,THE SACRIFICE.,"depravity; while, on the other hand, in the feudal parts of Italy--which"
1017,THE SACRIFICE.,had merely received a superficial Renaissance varnish imported from
1018,THE SACRIFICE.,"other places with painters and humanists--in Naples, Rome, and the"
1019,THE SACRIFICE.,"greater part of Umbria and the Marches, the upper classes had got into"
1020,THE SACRIFICE.,that monstrous condition which seems to have been the inevitable final
1021,THE SACRIFICE.,"product of feudalism, and which, while it gave France her Armagnacs, her"
1022,THE SACRIFICE.,"Foix, and her Retz, gave Italy their counterparts in her hideously"
1023,THE SACRIFICE.,"depraved princelets, the Malatestas, Varanos, Vitelli, and Baglioni."
1024,THE SACRIFICE.,"Both these classes of men, despots and feudal nobles, had a wide field"
1025,THE SACRIFICE.,for their ambition among the necessarily dissolved civic institutions;
1026,THE SACRIFICE.,and their easy success contributed to confirm the general tendency of
1027,THE SACRIFICE.,"the day to say with Commines, ""Qui a le succès a l'honneur,"" and to"
1028,THE SACRIFICE.,confound these two words and ideas. Nor was this yet all: the men of the
1029,THE SACRIFICE.,"Renaissance discovered the antique world, and in their wild, blind"
1030,THE SACRIFICE.,"enthusiasm, in their ardent, insatiable thirst for its literature,"
1031,THE SACRIFICE.,"swallowed it eagerly, dregs and all, till they were drunk and poisoned."
1032,THE SACRIFICE.,
1033,THE SACRIFICE.,"These are the main causes of the immorality of the Renaissance: first,"
1034,THE SACRIFICE.,"the general disbelief in all accepted doctrines, due to the falseness"
1035,THE SACRIFICE.,"and unnaturalness of those hitherto prevalent; secondly, the success of"
1036,THE SACRIFICE.,"unscrupulous talent in a condition of political disorder; thirdly, the"
1037,THE SACRIFICE.,"wholesale and unjudging enthusiasm for all that remained of Antiquity,"
1038,THE SACRIFICE.,"good or bad. These three great causes, united in a general intellectual"
1039,THE SACRIFICE.,"ebullition, are the explanation of the worst feature of the Renaissance:"
1040,THE SACRIFICE.,"not the wickedness of numberless single individuals, but the universal"
1041,THE SACRIFICE.,"toleration of it by the people at large. Men like Sigismondo Malatesta,"
1042,THE SACRIFICE.,"Sixtus IV., Alexander VI., and Cæsar Borgia might be passed over as"
1043,THE SACRIFICE.,"exceptions, as monstrous aberrations which cannot affect our judgment of"
1044,THE SACRIFICE.,their time and nation; but the general indifference towards their vices
1045,THE SACRIFICE.,shown by their contemporaries and countrymen is a conclusive and
1046,THE SACRIFICE.,terrible proof of the moral chaos of the Renaissance. It is just the
1047,THE SACRIFICE.,"presence of so much instinctive simplicity and virtue, of childlike"
1048,THE SACRIFICE.,"devotion to great objects, of patriarchal simplicity of manners, of all"
1049,THE SACRIFICE.,that is loveable in the books of men like Vespasiano da Bisticci and
1050,THE SACRIFICE.,Leon Battista Albert; of so much that seems like the realization of the
1051,THE SACRIFICE.,"idyllic home and merchant life of Schiller's ""Song of the Bell,"" by the"
1052,THE SACRIFICE.,side of all the hideous lawlessness and vice of the despots and
1053,THE SACRIFICE.,humanists; that makes the Renaissance so drearily painful a spectacle.
1054,THE SACRIFICE.,"The presence of the good does not console us for that of the evil,"
1055,THE SACRIFICE.,because it neither mitigates nor even shrinks from it; we merely lose
1056,THE SACRIFICE.,our pleasure in the good nature and simplicity of Æneas Sylvius when we
1057,THE SACRIFICE.,see his cool admiration for a man of fraud and violence like Sforza; we
1058,THE SACRIFICE.,begin to mistrust the purity and integrity of the upright Guarino da
1059,THE SACRIFICE.,Verona when we hear his lenient judgment of the infamous Beccadelli; we
1060,THE SACRIFICE.,"require of the virtuous that they should not only be incapable of vice,"
1061,THE SACRIFICE.,but abhorrent of it; and this is what even the best men of the
1062,THE SACRIFICE.,Renaissance rarely were.
1063,THE SACRIFICE.,
1064,THE SACRIFICE.,Such a state of moral chaos there has constantly been when an old effete
1065,THE SACRIFICE.,"mode of thought required to be destroyed. Such work is always attended,"
1066,THE SACRIFICE.,"in greater or less degree, by this subversion of all recognized"
1067,THE SACRIFICE.,"authority, this indifference to evil, this bold tasting of the"
1068,THE SACRIFICE.,forbidden. In the eighteenth century France plays the same part that was
1069,THE SACRIFICE.,played in the fifteenth by Italy: again we meet the rebellion against
1070,THE SACRIFICE.,"all that has been consecrated by time and belief, the toleration of"
1071,THE SACRIFICE.,"evil, the praise of the abominable, in the midst of the search for the"
1072,THE SACRIFICE.,good. These two have been the great fever epochs of modern history;
1073,THE SACRIFICE.,fever necessary for a subsequent steady growth. Both gave back truth to
1074,THE SACRIFICE.,"man, and man to nature, at the expense of temporary moral uncertainty"
1075,THE SACRIFICE.,and ruthless destruction. The Renaissance reinstated the individual in
1076,THE SACRIFICE.,"his human dignity, as a thinking, feeling, and acting being; the"
1077,THE SACRIFICE.,Eighteenth Century reconstructed society as a homogeneous free
1078,THE SACRIFICE.,existence; both at the expense of individual degradation and social
1079,THE SACRIFICE.,disorder. Both were moments of ebullition in which horrible things rose
1080,THE SACRIFICE.,"to the surface, but after which what remained was purer than it had ever"
1081,THE SACRIFICE.,been before.
1082,THE SACRIFICE.,
1083,THE SACRIFICE.,This is no plea for the immorality of the Renaissance: evil is none the
1084,THE SACRIFICE.,less evil for being inevitable and necessary; but it is nevertheless
1085,THE SACRIFICE.,well that we should understand its necessity. It certainly is a terrible
1086,THE SACRIFICE.,"admission, but one which must be made, that evil is part of the"
1087,THE SACRIFICE.,mechanism for producing good; and had the arrangement of the universe
1088,THE SACRIFICE.,"been entrusted to us, benevolent and equitable people of an enlightened"
1089,THE SACRIFICE.,"age, there would doubtless have been invented some system of evolution"
1090,THE SACRIFICE.,and progression differing from the one which includes such machinery as
1091,THE SACRIFICE.,"hurricanes and pestilences, carnage and misery, superstition and"
1092,THE SACRIFICE.,"license, Renaissance and Eighteenth Century. But unfortunately Nature"
1093,THE SACRIFICE.,"was organized in a less charitable and intelligent fashion; and, among"
1094,THE SACRIFICE.,"other evils required for the final attainment of good, we find that of"
1095,THE SACRIFICE.,whole generations of men being condemned to moral uncertainty and error
1096,THE SACRIFICE.,in order that other generations may enjoy knowledge peacefully and
1097,THE SACRIFICE.,"guiltlessly. Let us remember this, and let us be more generous towards"
1098,THE SACRIFICE.,"the men who were wicked that we might be enlightened. Above all, let us"
1099,THE SACRIFICE.,"bear in mind, in judging the Renaissance, that the sacrifice which it"
1100,THE SACRIFICE.,represents could be useful only in so far as it was complete and
1101,THE SACRIFICE.,"irretrievable. Let us remember that the communal system of government,"
1102,THE SACRIFICE.,"on whose development the Renaissance mainly depended, inevitably"
1103,THE SACRIFICE.,perished in proportion as it developed; that the absolute subjugation of
1104,THE SACRIFICE.,Italy by Barbarous nations was requisite to the dissemination of the
1105,THE SACRIFICE.,civilization thus obtained; that the Italians were politically
1106,THE SACRIFICE.,"annihilated before they had time to recover a normal condition, and were"
1107,THE SACRIFICE.,"given up crushed and broken spirited, to be taught righteousness by"
1108,THE SACRIFICE.,"Spaniards and Jesuits. That, in short, while the morality of the"
1109,THE SACRIFICE.,Italians was sacrificed to obtain the knowledge on which modern society
1110,THE SACRIFICE.,"depends, the political existence of Italy was sacrificed to the"
1111,THE SACRIFICE.,"diffusion of that knowledge, and that the nation was not only doomed to"
1112,THE SACRIFICE.,"immorality, but doomed also to the inability to reform. Perhaps, if we"
1113,THE SACRIFICE.,"think of all this, and weigh the tremendous sacrifice to which we owe"
1114,THE SACRIFICE.,"our present intellectual advantages, we may still feel sad, but sad"
1115,THE SACRIFICE.,"rather with remorse than with indignation, in contemplating the"
1116,THE SACRIFICE.,condition of Italy in the first years of the sixteenth century; in
1117,THE SACRIFICE.,"looking down from our calm, safe, scientific position, on the murder of"
1118,THE SACRIFICE.,"the Italian Renaissance: great and noble at heart, cut off pitilessly at"
1119,THE SACRIFICE.,its prime; denied even an hour to repent and amend; hurried off before
1120,THE SACRIFICE.,"the tribunal of posterity, suddenly, unexpectedly, and still bearing its"
1121,THE SACRIFICE.,"weight of unexpiated, unrecognized guilt."

1129,I.,I.
1130,I.,
1131,I.,The chroniclers of the last years of the fifteenth century have recorded
1132,I.,how the soldiery of Charles VIII. of France amused the tedious leisure
1133,I.,"of their sullen and suspicious occupation of Rome, by erecting in the"
1134,I.,"camp a stage of planks, and performing thereon a rude mystery-play. The"
1135,I.,play thus improvised by a handful of troopers before this motley
1136,I.,"invading army: before the feudal cavalry of Burgundy, strange steel"
1137,I.,"monsters, half bird, half reptile, with steel beaked and winged helmets"
1138,I.,"and claw-like steel shoes, and jointed steel corselet and rustling steel"
1139,I.,"mail coat; before the infantry of Gascony, rapid and rapacious with"
1140,I.,"their tattered doublets and rag-bound feet; before the over-fed,"
1141,I.,"immensely plumed, and slashed and furbelowed giants of Switzerland, and"
1142,I.,"the starved, half-naked savages of Brittany and the Marches--before this"
1143,I.,"multifaced, many-speeched army, gathered from the rich cities of the"
1144,I.,"North and the devastated fields of the South, and the wilds and rocks of"
1145,I.,"the West and the East, alike in nothing save in its wonder and dread and"
1146,I.,delight and horror at this strange invaded Italy--the play performed for
1147,I.,the entertainment of this encamped army was no ordinary play. No clerkly
1148,I.,allegorical morality; no mouthing and capering market-place farce; no
1149,I.,"history of Joseph and his brethren, of the birth of the Saviour, or of"
1150,I.,"the temptations of St. Anthony. It was the half-allegorical,"
1151,I.,half-dramatic representation of the reigning Borgia pope and his
1152,I.,children; it was the rude and hesitating moulding into dramatic shape of
1153,I.,"those terrible rumours of simony and poison, of lust and of violence, of"
1154,I.,"mysterious death and abominable love, which had met the invaders as they"
1155,I.,had first set their feet in Italy; which had become louder and clearer
1156,I.,"with every onward step through the peninsula, and now circulated around"
1157,I.,"them, with frightful distinctness, in the very capital of Christ's vicar"
1158,I.,on earth. This blundering mystery-play of the French troopers is the
1159,I.,earliest imaginative fruit of that first terrified and fascinated
1160,I.,glimpse of the men of the barbarous North at the strange Italy of the
1161,I.,Renaissance; it is the first manifestation of that strong tragic impulse
1162,I.,"due to the sudden sight, by rude and imaginative young nations, of the"
1163,I.,splendid and triumphant wickedness of Italy.
1164,I.,
1165,I.,"The French saw, wondered, shuddered, and played upon their camp stage"
1166,I.,"the tragedy of the Borgias. But the French remained in Italy, became"
1167,I.,"familiar with its ways, and soon merely shrugged their shoulders and"
1168,I.,smiled where they had once stared in horror. They served under the flags
1169,I.,"of Sforzas, Borgias, Baglionis, and Vitellis, by the side of the bravos"
1170,I.,of Naples and Umbria; they saw their princes wed the daughters of
1171,I.,"evil-famed Italian sovereigns, and their princes' children, their own"
1172,I.,"Valois and Guises, develope into puny, ambiguous, and ominous Medicis"
1173,I.,"and Gonzagas, surrounded by Italian minions and poison distillers, and"
1174,I.,"buffoons and money-lenders. The French of the sixteenth century, during"
1175,I.,"their long Neapolitan and Lombard wars and negotiations, and time to"
1176,I.,"learn all that Italy could teach; to become refined, subtle,"
1177,I.,"indifferent, and cynical: bastard Italians, with the bastard Italian art"
1178,I.,"of Goujon and Philibert Delorme, and the bastard Italian poetry of Du"
1179,I.,Bellay and Ronsard. The French of the sixteenth century therefore
1180,I.,translated Machiavel and Ariosto and Bandello; but they never again
1181,I.,attempted such another play as that which they had improvised while
1182,I.,"listening to the tales of Alexander VI. and Cæsar and Lucrezia, in their"
1183,I.,camp in the meadows behind Sant' Angelo. The Spaniards then came to
1184,I.,"Italy, and the Germans: strong mediæval nations, like the French, with"
1185,I.,"the creative power of the Middle Ages still in them, refreshed by the"
1186,I.,long rest of the dull fifteenth century. But Spaniards and Germans came
1187,I.,as mere greedy and besotten and savage mercenaries: the scum of their
1188,I.,"countries, careless of Italian sights and deeds, thinking only of"
1189,I.,"torturing for hidden treasure, or swilling southern wines; and they"
1190,I.,"returned to Spain and to Germany, to persecutions of Moriscos and"
1191,I.,"plundering of abbeys, as savage and as dull as they had arrived. A"
1192,I.,"smattering of Italian literature, art, and manners was carried back to"
1193,I.,"Spain and Germany by Spanish and German princes and governors, to be"
1194,I.,transmitted to a few courtiers and humanists; but the imagination of the
1195,I.,"lower classes of Spain and of Germany, absorbed in the Quixotic"
1196,I.,"Catholicism of Loyola and the biblical contemplation of Luther, never"
1197,I.,came into fertilizing contact with the decaying Italy of the
1198,I.,Renaissance.
1199,I.,
1200,I.,The mystery-play of the soldiers of Charles VIII. seemed destined to
1201,I.,remain an isolated and abortive attempt. But it was not so. The
1202,I.,invasions had exhausted themselves; the political organization of Italy
1203,I.,"was definitely broken up; its material wealth was exhausted; the French,"
1204,I.,"Germans, and Spaniards had come and gone, and returned and gone again;"
1205,I.,"they had left nothing to annex or to pillage; when, about the middle of"
1206,I.,"the sixteenth century, the country began to be overrun by a new horde of"
1207,I.,barbarians: the English. The English came neither as invaders nor as
1208,I.,"marauders; they were peaceable students and rich noblemen, who, so far"
1209,I.,"from trying to extort money or annex territory, rather profited the"
1210,I.,ruined Italians by the work which they did and the money which they
1211,I.,"squandered. Yet these quiet and profitable travellers, before whom the"
1212,I.,"Italians might safely display their remaining wealth, were in reality as"
1213,I.,covetous of the possessions of Italy and as resolute to return home
1214,I.,enriched as any tattered Gascon men-at-arms or gluttonous Swiss or
1215,I.,"grinding Spaniards. They were, one and all, consciously and"
1216,I.,"unconsciously, dragged to Italy by the irresistible instinct that Italy"
1217,I.,possessed that which they required; by the greed of intellectual gain.
1218,I.,"That which they thus instinctively knew that Italy possessed, that which"
1219,I.,"they must obtain, was a mode of thought, a habit of form; philosophy,"
1220,I.,"art, civilization: all the materials for intellectual manipulation. For,"
1221,I.,"in the sixteenth century, on awakening from its long evil sleep, haunted"
1222,I.,"by the nightmare of civil war, of the fifteenth century, the English"
1223,I.,"mind had started up in the vigour of well-nigh mature youth, fed up and"
1224,I.,rested by the long inactivity in which it had slept through its period
1225,I.,of assimilation and growth. It had awakened at the first touch of
1226,I.,"foreign influence, and had grown with every fresh contact with the outer"
1227,I.,world: with the first glance at Plato and Xenophon suddenly opened by
1228,I.,"Erasmus and Colet, at the Bible suddenly opened by Cranmer; it had grown"
1229,I.,with its sob of indignation at the sight of the burning faggots
1230,I.,"surrounding the martyrs, with its joyous heart-throbs at the sight of"
1231,I.,the seas and islands of the New World; it had grown with the sudden
1232,I.,passionate strain of every nerve and every muscle when the galleys of
1233,I.,"Philip had been sighted in the Channel. And when it had paused, taken"
1234,I.,"breath, and looked calmly around it, after the tumult of all these"
1235,I.,"sights and sounds and actions, the English mind, in the time of"
1236,I.,"Elizabeth, had found itself of a sudden full-grown and blossomed out"
1237,I.,"into superb manhood, with burning activities and indefatigable powers."
1238,I.,But it had found itself without materials for work. Of the scholastic
1239,I.,philosophy and the chivalric poetry of the Middle Ages there remained
1240,I.,"but little that could be utilized: the few bungled formulæ, the few"
1241,I.,"half-obsolete rhymes still remaining, were as unintelligible, in their"
1242,I.,"spirit of feudalism and monasticism and mysticism, as were the Angevin"
1243,I.,English and the monkish Latin in which they were written to these men of
1244,I.,the sixteenth century. All the intellectual wealth of England remained
1245,I.,"to be created; but it could not be created out of nothing. Spenser,"
1246,I.,"Shakespeare, and Bacon could not be produced out of the half-effete"
1247,I.,"and scattered fragments of Chaucer, of Scotus, and of Wycliffe. The"
1248,I.,"materials on which English genius was to work must be sought abroad, and"
1249,I.,abroad they could be found only in Italy. For in the demolished Italy of
1250,I.,the sixteenth century lay the whole intellectual wealth of the world:
1251,I.,"the great legacy of Antiquity, the great work of the Middle Ages had"
1252,I.,"been stored up, and had been increased threefold, and sorted and"
1253,I.,classified by the Renaissance; and now that the national edifice had
1254,I.,"been dismantled and dilapidated, and the national activity was"
1255,I.,"languishing, it all lay in confusion, awaiting only the hand of those"
1256,I.,who would carry it away and use it once more. To Italy therefore
1257,I.,Englishmen of thought and fancy were dragged by an impulse of adventure
1258,I.,and greed as irresistible as that which dragged to Antwerp and the Hanse
1259,I.,"ports, to India and America, the seekers for gold and for soil. To Italy"
1260,I.,"they flocked and through Italy they rambled, prying greedily into each"
1261,I.,"cranny and mound of the half-broken civilization, upturning with avid"
1262,I.,curiosity all the rubbish and filth; seeking with aching eyes and
1263,I.,itching fingers for the precious fragments of intellectual splendour;
1264,I.,"lingering with fascinated glance over the broken remnants and deep,"
1265,I.,"mysterious gulfs of a crumbling and devastated civilization. And then,"
1266,I.,"impatient of their intoxicating and tantalizing search, suddenly grown"
1267,I.,"desperate, they clutched and stored away everything, and returned home"
1268,I.,"tattered, soiled, bedecked with gold and with tinsel, laden with an"
1269,I.,"immense uncouth burden of jewels, and broken wealth, and refuse and"
1270,I.,"ordure, with pseudo-antique philosophy, with half-mediæval Dantesque and"
1271,I.,"Petrarchesque poetry, with Renaissance science, with humanistic pedantry"
1272,I.,"and obscenity, with euphuistic conceits and casuistic quibble, with art,"
1273,I.,"politics, metaphysics--civilization embedded in all manner of rubbish"
1274,I.,"and abomination, soiled with all manner of ominous stains. All this did"
1275,I.,they carry home and throw helter-skelter into the new-kindled fire of
1276,I.,"English intellectual life, mingling with it many a humble-seeming"
1277,I.,"Northern alloy; cleaning and compounding, casting into shapes, mediæval"
1278,I.,"and English, this strange Corinthian brass made of all these"
1279,I.,"heterogeneous remnants, classical, Italian, Saxon, and Christian. A"
1280,I.,"strange Corinthian brass indeed; and as various in tint, in weight, and"
1281,I.,"in tone, in manifold varieties of mixture, as were the moulds into which"
1282,I.,it was cast: the white and delicate silver settling down in the gracious
1283,I.,"poetic moulds of Sidney and Spenser; the glittering gold, which can buy"
1284,I.,"and increase, in the splendid, heavy mould of Bacon's prose; and the"
1285,I.,"copper, the iron, the silver and gold in wondrous mixture, with wondrous"
1286,I.,"iridescences of colour and wondrous scale of tone, all poured into the"
1287,I.,"manifold moulds, fantastic and beautiful and grand, of Shakespeare. And"
1288,I.,as long as all this dross and ore and filth brought from the ruins of
1289,I.,"Italy was thus mingling in the heat of English genius, while it was yet"
1290,I.,"but imperfectly fused, while already its purest and best compounded"
1291,I.,"portion was being poured in Shakespeare's mould, and when already there"
1292,I.,remained only a seething residue; as long as there remained aught of the
1293,I.,"glowing fire and the molten mass, some of it all, of the pure metal"
1294,I.,"bubbling up, of the scum frothing round, nay, of the very used-up dregs,"
1295,I.,"was ever and anon being ladled out--gold, dross, filth, all"
1296,I.,"indiscriminately--and cast into shapes severe, graceful, or uncouth. And"
1297,I.,"this somewhat, thus pilfered from what was to make, or was making, or"
1298,I.,"had made, the works of Shakespeare; this base and noble, still unfused"
1299,I.,"or already exhausted alloy, became the strange heterogeneous works of"
1300,I.,"the Elizabethan dramatists: of Webster, of Ford, of Tourneur, of Ben"
1301,I.,"Jonson, of Beaumont and Fletcher, and of their minor brethren; from the"
1302,I.,"splendid ore of Marlowe, only half molten and half freed from dross,"
1303,I.,"down to the shining metal, smooth and silvery as only tinsel can be, of"
1304,I.,Massinger.
1305,I.,
1306,I.,"In all the works of our Elizabethans, we see not only the assimilated"
1307,I.,"intellectual wealth of Italy, but we see the deep impression, the"
1308,I.,"indelible picture in the memory, of Italy itself; the positive,"
1309,I.,"unallegorical, essentially secular mode of thought; the unascetic,"
1310,I.,"æsthetic, eminently human mode of feeling; the artistic desire of clear"
1311,I.,and harmonious form; the innumerable tendencies and habits which sever
1312,I.,"the Elizabethans so completely from the Middle Ages, and bring them so"
1313,I.,"near at once to ourselves and to the ancients, making them at once"
1314,I.,"antique and modern, in opposition to mediæval; these essential"
1315,I.,"characters and the vast bulk of absolute scientific fact and formula, of"
1316,I.,"philosophic opinion, of artistic shape, of humanistic learning, are only"
1317,I.,one-half of the debt of our sixteenth century to the Italy of the
1318,I.,"Renaissance. The delicate form of the Italian sonnet, as copied by"
1319,I.,"Sidney from Bembo and Molza and Costanzo, contained within it the exotic"
1320,I.,"and exquisite ideal passion of the ""Vita Nuova"" and Petrarch. With the"
1321,I.,"bright, undulating stanza Spenser received from Ariosto and Tasso the"
1322,I.,richly coloured spirit of the Italian descriptive epic. With the
1323,I.,splendid involutions of Machiavelli's and Guicciardini's prose Bacon
1324,I.,learned their cool and disimpassioned philosophy. From the reading of
1325,I.,"Politian and Lorenzo dei Medici, from the sight of the Psyche of"
1326,I.,"Raphael, the Europa of Veronese, the Ariadne of Tintoret, men like"
1327,I.,Greene and Dorset learned that revival of a more luscious and pictorial
1328,I.,"antique which was brought to perfection in Shakespeare's ""Venus and"
1329,I.,"Adonis"" and Marlowe's ""Sestiad."" From the Platonists and Epicureans of"
1330,I.,Renaissance Italy our greatest dramatists learned that cheerful and
1331,I.,"serious love of life, that solemn and manly facing of death, that sense"
1332,I.,"of the finiteness of man, the inexhaustibleness of nature, which shines"
1333,I.,"out in such grand, paganism, with such Olympian serenity, as of the bent"
1334,I.,"brows and smiling lips of an antique Zeus, in Shakespeare, in Marlowe,"
1335,I.,"in Beaumont and Fletcher, even in the sad and savage Webster. But with"
1336,I.,"the abstract, with the imbibed modes of thought and feeling, with the"
1337,I.,"imitated forms, the Elizabethans brought back from Italy the concrete,"
1338,I.,"the individual, the personal. They filled their works with Italian"
1339,I.,"things: from the whole plot of a play borrowed from an Italian novel, to"
1340,I.,"the mere passing allusion to an Italian habit, or the mere quotation of"
1341,I.,an Italian word; from the full-length picture of the actions of Italian
1342,I.,"men and women, down to the mere sketch, in two or three words, of a bit"
1343,I.,"of Italian garden or a group of Italian figures; nay, to the innumerable"
1344,I.,"scraps of tiny detail, grotesque, graceful, or richly coloured, which"
1345,I.,they stuffed into all their works: allusions to the buffoons of the mask
1346,I.,"comedy, to the high-voiced singers, to the dress of the Venetian"
1347,I.,"merchants, to the step of a dance; to the pomegranate in the garden or"
1348,I.,the cypress on the hillside; mere names of Italian things: the _lavolta_
1349,I.,"and _corranto_ dances, the _Traglietto_ ferry, the Rialto bridge;"
1350,I.,"countless little touches, trifling to us, but which brought home to the"
1351,I.,audience at the Globe or at Blackfriars that wonderful Italy which every
1352,I.,"man of the day had travelled through at least in spirit, and had loved"
1353,I.,at least in imagination. And of this wonderful Italy the Englishmen of
1354,I.,"the days of Elizabeth and of James knew yet another side; were familiar,"
1355,I.,"whether travelled or untravelled, with yet other things besides the"
1356,I.,"buffoons and singers and dancers, the scholars and learned ladies, the"
1357,I.,"pomegranates, and cypresses and roses and nightingales; were fascinated"
1358,I.,"by something besides the green lagoons, the clear summer nights, the"
1359,I.,soft spring evenings of which we feel as it were the fascination in the
1360,I.,words of Jessica and Portia and Juliet. The English knew and were
1361,I.,"haunted by the crimes of Italy: the terrible and brilliant, the"
1362,I.,"mysterious and shadowy crimes of lust and of blood which, in their most"
1363,I.,gigantic union and monstrous enthronement on the throne of the vicar of
1364,I.,"Christ, had in the first terrified glimpse awakened the tragic impulse"
1365,I.,in the soldiers of Charles VIII.
1366,I.,
1367,I.,We can imagine the innumerable English travellers who went to Italy
1368,I.,greedy for life and knowledge or merely obeying a fashion of the
1369,I.,day--travellers forced into far closer contact with the natives than the
1370,I.,"men of the time of Walpole and of Beckford, who were met by"
1371,I.,French-speaking hosts and lacqueys and officials--travellers also
1372,I.,thirsting to imbibe the very spirit of the country as the travellers of
1373,I.,the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries never thirsted; we can imagine
1374,I.,these Englishmen possessed by the morbid passion for the stories of
1375,I.,"abominable and unpunished crime--crime of the learned, the refined, the"
1376,I.,splendid parts of society--with which the Italy of the deeply corrupted
1377,I.,sixteenth century was permeated. We can imagine how the prosaic
1378,I.,"merchants' clerks from London; the perfumed dandies, trying on Italian"
1379,I.,"clothes, rehearsing Italian steps and collecting Italian oaths, the"
1380,I.,Faulcon-bridges of Shakespeare and Mr. Gingleboys of Beaumont and
1381,I.,"Fletcher, sent to Italy to be able gracefully to"
1382,I.,
1383,I.,
1384,I.,"Kiss the hand and cry, ""sweet lady!"""
1385,I.,"Say they had been at Rome and seen the relics,"
1386,I.,"Drunk your Verdea wine, and rid at Naples--"
1387,I.,
1388,I.,
1389,I.,how all these privileged creatures ferreted about for monstrous crimes
1390,I.,with which to horrify their stay-at-home countrymen; how the rich young
1391,I.,"lords, returning home with mincing steps and high-pitched lisp,"
1392,I.,"surrounded by a train of parti-coloured, dialect-jabbering Venetian"
1393,I.,"clowns, deft and sinister Neapolitan fencing masters, silver-voiced"
1394,I.,"singing boys decoyed from some church, and cynical humanists escaped"
1395,I.,"from the faggot or the gallows, were expected to bring home, together"
1396,I.,"with the newest pastoral dramas, lewd novels, Platonic philosophy and"
1397,I.,madrigals set in complicated counterpoint; stories of hideous
1398,I.,"wickedness, of the murders and rapes and poisonings committed by the"
1399,I.,"dukes and duchesses, the nobles and senators, in whose palaces they had"
1400,I.,so lately supped and danced. The crimes of Italy fascinated Englishmen
1401,I.,of genius with a fascination even more potent than that which they
1402,I.,exercised over the vulgar imagination of mere foppish and swashbuckler
1403,I.,lovers of the scandalous and the sensational: they fascinated with the
1404,I.,"attraction of tragic grandeur, of psychological strangeness, of moral"
1405,I.,"monstrosity, a generation in whom the passionate imagination of the"
1406,I.,playwright was curiously blent with the metaphysical analysis of the
1407,I.,"philosopher and the ethical judgment of the Puritan. To these men, ardent"
1408,I.,and serious even in their profligacy; imaginative and passionate even in
1409,I.,"their Puritanism, all sucking avidly at this newly found Italian"
1410,I.,civilization; the wickedness of Italy was more than morbidly attractive
1411,I.,or morbidly appalling: it was imaginatively and psychologically
1412,I.,"fascinating. Whether they were as part of the action or as allusions, as"
1413,I.,"in Webster's two great plays, in which there occurs poisoning by means"
1414,I.,"of the leaves of a book, poisoning by the poisoned lips of a picture,"
1415,I.,"poisoning by a helmet, poisoning by the pommel of a saddle; crimes were"
1416,I.,"multiplied by means of subordinate plots and unnecessary incidents, like"
1417,I.,"the double vengeance of Richardetto and of Hippolita in Ford's ""Giovanni"
1418,I.,"and Annabella,"" where both characters are absolutely unnecessary to the"
1419,I.,main story of the horrible love of the hero and heroine; like the
1420,I.,"murders of Levidulcia and Sebastian in Tourneur's ""Atheist's Tragedy,"""
1421,I.,and the completely unnecessary though extremely pathetic death of young
1422,I.,"Marcello in Webster's ""White Devil;"" until the plays were brought to a"
1423,I.,"close by the gradual extermination of all the principal performers, and"
1424,I.,only a few confidants and dummies remained to bury the corpses which
1425,I.,strewed the stage. Imaginary monsters were fashioned out of half-a-dozen
1426,I.,"Neapolitan and Milanese princes, by Ford, by Beaumont and Fletcher, by"
1427,I.,"Middleton, by Marston, even by the light and graceful Philip Massinger:"
1428,I.,"mythical villains, Ferdinands, Lodowicks, and Fernezes, who yet fell"
1429,I.,"short of the frightful realities of men like Sigismondo Malatesta,"
1430,I.,"Alexander VI., and Pier Luigi Farnese; nay, more typical monsters, with"
1431,I.,"no name save their vices, Lussuriosos, Gelosos, Ambitiosos, and"
1432,I.,"Vindicis, like those drawn by the strong and savage hand of Cyril"
1433,I.,Tourneur.
1434,I.,
1435,I.,Nothing which the English stage could display seemed to the minds of
1436,I.,English playwrights and the public to give an adequate picture of the
1437,I.,abominations of Italy; much as they heaped up horrors and combined them
1438,I.,"with artistic skill, much as they forced into sight, there yet remained"
1439,I.,"an abyss of evil which the English tongue refused to mention, but which"
1440,I.,"weighed upon the English mind; and which, unspoken, nay (and it is the"
1441,I.,"glory of the Elizabethan dramatists excepting Ford), unhinted, yet"
1442,I.,remained as an incubus in the consciousness of the playwrights and the
1443,I.,"public, was in their thoughts when they wrote and heard such savage"
1444,I.,misanthropic outbursts as those of Tourneur and of Marston. The sense of
1445,I.,the rottenness of the country whence they were obtaining their
1446,I.,"intellectual nourishment, haunted with a sort of sickening fascination"
1447,I.,"the imaginative and psychological minds of the late sixteenth century,"
1448,I.,of the men who had had time to outgrow the first cynical plunge of the
1449,I.,"rebellious immature intellects of the contemporaries of Greene, Peele,"
1450,I.,and Marlowe into that dissolved civilization. And of the great men who
1451,I.,"were thus enthralled by Italy and Italian evil, only Shakespeare and"
1452,I.,"Massinger maintain or regain their serenity and hopefulness of spirit,"
1453,I.,resist the incubus of horror: Shakespeare from the immense scope of his
1454,I.,"vision, which permitted him to pass over the base and frightful parts of"
1455,I.,human nature and see its purer and higher sides; Massinger from the very
1456,I.,"superficiality of his insight and the narrowness of his sympathies,"
1457,I.,which prevented his ever thoroughly realizing the very horrors he had
1458,I.,himself invented. But on the minds less elastic than that of
1459,I.,"Shakespeare, and less superficial than that of Massinger, the Italian"
1460,I.,evil weighed like a nightmare. With an infinitely powerful and
1461,I.,"passionate imagination, and an exquisitely subtle faculty of mental"
1462,I.,analysis; only lately freed from the dogma of the Middle Ages; unsettled
1463,I.,in their philosophy; inclined by wholesale classical reading to a sort
1464,I.,"of negative atheism, a fatalistic and half-melancholy mixture of"
1465,I.,"epicurism and stoicism; yet keenly alive, from study of the Bible and of"
1466,I.,"religious controversies, to all questions of right and wrong; thus"
1467,I.,"highly wrought and deeply perplexed, the minds of the Elizabethan poets"
1468,I.,were impressed by the wickedness of Italy as by the horrible deeds of
1469,I.,"one whom we are accustomed to venerate as our guide, whom we cannot but"
1470,I.,"love as our benefactor, whom we cannot but admire as our superior: it"
1471,I.,"was a sense of frightful anomaly, of putrescence in beauty and"
1472,I.,"splendour, of death in life and life in death, which made the English"
1473,I.,"psychologist-poets savage and sombre, cynical and wrathful and hopeless."
1474,I.,"The influence is the same on all, and the difference of attitude is"
1475,I.,"slight, and due to individual characters; but the gloom is the same in"
1476,I.,each of them. In Webster--no mere grisly inventor of Radcliffian
1477,I.,"horrors, as we are apt to think of the greatest of our dramatists--after"
1478,I.,Shakespeare--in the noble and tender nature of Webster the sense is one
1479,I.,"of ineffable sadness, unmarred by cynicism, but unbrightened by hope."
1480,I.,"The villains, even if successful till death overtake them, are mere"
1481,I.,hideous phantoms--
1482,I.,
1483,I.,
1484,I.,these wretched eminent things
1485,I.,"Leave no more fame behind 'em, than should one"
1486,I.,"Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow--"
1487,I.,
1488,I.,
1489,I.,"the victims of tortured conscience, or, worse still, the owners of"
1490,I.,petrified hearts; there is nothing to envy in them. But none the better
1491,I.,"is it for the good: if Ferdinands, Bosolas, Brachianos, and Flaminios"
1492,I.,"perish miserably, it is only after having done to death the tender and"
1493,I.,"brave Duchess, the gentle Antonio, the chivalric Marcello; there is"
1494,I.,"virtue on earth, but there is no justice in heaven. The half-pagan,"
1495,I.,half-puritanic feeling of Webster bursts out in the dying speech of the
1496,I.,villain Bosola--
1497,I.,
1498,I.,
1499,I.,"O, this gloomy world!"
1500,I.,"In what a shadow, or deep pit of darkness,"
1501,I.,Doth womanish and fearful mankind live!
1502,I.,Let worthy minds ne'er stagger in distrust
1503,I.,To suffer death or shame for what is just.
1504,I.,
1505,I.,
1506,I.,"Of real justice in this life or compensation in another, there is no"
1507,I.,"thought: Webster, though a Puritan in spirit, is no Christian in faith."
1508,I.,"On Ford the influence is different; although equal, perhaps, in genius"
1509,I.,"to Webster, surpassing him even in intense tragic passion, he was far"
1510,I.,"below Webster, and, indeed, far below all his generation, in moral"
1511,I.,"fibre. The sight of evil fascinates him; his conscience staggers, his"
1512,I.,sympathies are bedraggled in foulness; in the chaos of good and evil he
1513,I.,"loses his reckoning, and recognizes the superiority only of strength of"
1514,I.,"passion, of passion for good or evil: the incestuous Giovanni, daring"
1515,I.,his enemies like a wild beast at bay and cheating them of their revenge
1516,I.,"by himself murdering the object of his horrible passion, is as heroic in"
1517,I.,"the eyes of Ford as the magnanimous Princess of Sparta, bearing with"
1518,I.,"unflinching spirit the succession of misfortunes poured down upon her,"
1519,I.,and leading off the dance while messenger succeeds messenger of evil;
1520,I.,"till, free from her duties as a queen, she sinks down dead. Cyril"
1521,I.,Tourneur and John Marston are far more incomplete in genius than either
1522,I.,"Webster or Ford, although Tourneur sometimes obtains a lurid and ghastly"
1523,I.,tragic intensity which more than equals Ford when at his best; and
1524,I.,"Marston, in the midst of crabbedness and dulness, sometimes has touches"
1525,I.,of pathos and Michelangelesque foreshortenings of metaphor worthy of
1526,I.,Webster. But Tourneur and Marston have neither the constant sympathy
1527,I.,"with oppressed virtue of the author of the ""Duchess of Malfy,"" nor the"
1528,I.,"blind fury of passion of the poet of ""Giovanni and Annabella;"" they look"
1529,I.,on grim and hopeless spectators at the world of fatalistic and insane
1530,I.,"wickedness which they have created, in which their heroes and heroines"
1531,I.,and villains are slowly entangled in inextricable evil. The men and
1532,I.,women of Tourneur and Marston are scarcely men and women at all: they
1533,I.,"are mere vague spectres, showing their grisly wounds and moaning out"
1534,I.,their miserable fate. There is around them a thick and clammy moral
1535,I.,"darkness, dispelled only by the ghastly flashes of lurid virtue of"
1536,I.,maniacs like Tourneur's Vindici and Hippolito; a crypt-like moral
1537,I.,"stillness, haunted by strange evil murmurs, broken only by the"
1538,I.,hysterical sobs and laughs of Marston's Antonios and Pandulphos. At the
1539,I.,"most there issues out of the blood-reeking depth a mighty yell of pain,"
1540,I.,a tremendous imprecation not only at sinful man but at unsympathizing
1541,I.,"nature, like that of Marston's old Doge, dethroned, hunted down, crying"
1542,I.,aloud into the grey dawn-mists of the desolate marsh by the lagoon--
1543,I.,
1544,I.,
1545,I.,O thou all-bearing earth
1546,I.,Which men do gape for till thou cram'st their mouths
1547,I.,And choak'st their throats for dust: O charme thy breast
1548,I.,And let me sinke into thee.  Look who knocks;
1549,I.,"Andrugio calls. But O, she's deafe and blinde."
1550,I.,A wretch but leane relief on earth can finde.
1551,I.,
1552,I.,
1553,I.,"The tragic sense, the sense of utter blank evil, is stronger in all"
1554,I.,these Elizabethan painters of Italian crime than perhaps in any other
1555,I.,"tragic writers. There is, in the great and sinister pictures of Webster,"
1556,I.,"of Ford, of Tourneur, and of Marston, no spot of light, no distant"
1557,I.,"bright horizon. There is no loving suffering, resigned to suffer and to"
1558,I.,"pardon, like that of Desdemona, whose dying lips forgive the beloved who"
1559,I.,"kills from too great love; no consoling affection like Cordelia's, in"
1560,I.,whose gentle embrace the poor bruised soul may sink into rest; no
1561,I.,"passionate union in death with the beloved, like the union of Romeo and"
1562,I.,"Juliet; nothing but implacable cruelty, violent death received with"
1563,I.,"agonized protest, or at best as the only release from unmitigated misery"
1564,I.,"with which the wretch has become familiar,"
1565,I.,
1566,I.,As the tann'd galley slave is with his oar.
1567,I.,
1568,I.,"Neither is there in these plays that solemn sense of heavenly justice,"
1569,I.,of the fatality hanging over a house which will be broken when guilt
1570,I.,"shall have been expiated, which lends a sort of serene background of"
1571,I.,eternal justice to the terrible tales of Thebes and Argos. There is for
1572,I.,"these men no fatality save the evil nature of man, no justice save the"
1573,I.,"doubling of crime, no compensation save revenge: there is for Webster"
1574,I.,"and Ford and Tourneur and Marston no heaven above, wrathful but"
1575,I.,placable; there are no Gods revengeful but just: there is nothing but
1576,I.,"this blood-stained and corpse-strewn earth, defiled by lust-burnt and"
1577,I.,"death-hungering men, felling each other down and trampling on one"
1578,I.,another blindly in the eternal darkness which surrounds them. The world
1579,I.,"of these great poets is not the open world with its light and its air,"
1580,I.,"its purifying storms and lightnings: it is the darkened Italian palace,"
1581,I.,with its wrought-iron bars preventing escape; its embroidered carpets
1582,I.,"muffling the foot steps; its hidden, suddenly yawning trapdoors; its"
1583,I.,arras-hangings concealing masked ruffians; its garlands of poisoned
1584,I.,"flowers; its long suites of untenanted darkened rooms, through which the"
1585,I.,"wretch is pursued by the half-crazed murderer; while below, in the"
1586,I.,"cloistered court, the clanking armour and stamping horses, and above, in"
1587,I.,"the carved and gilded hall, the viols and lutes and cornets make a"
1588,I.,"cheery triumphant concert, and drown the cries of the victim."
1589,I.,
1590,I.,
1591,II.,II.
1592,II.,
1593,II.,Such is the Italy of the Renaissance as we see it in the works of our
1594,II.,"tragic playwrights: a country of mysterious horror, the sinister"
1595,II.,reputation of which lasted two hundred years; lasted triumphantly
1596,II.,"throughout the light and finikin eighteenth century, and found its"
1597,II.,latest expression in the grim and ghastly romances of the school of Ann
1598,II.,"Radcliff, romances which are but the last puny and grotesque descendants"
1599,II.,"of the great stock of Italian tragedies, born of the first"
1600,II.,terror-stricken meeting of the England of Elizabeth with the Italy of
1601,II.,the late Renaissance. Is the impression received by the Elizabethan
1602,II.,playwrights a correct impression? Was Italy in the sixteenth century
1603,II.,that land of horrors? Reviewing in our memory the literature and art of
1604,II.,"the Italian Renaissance, remembering the innumerable impressions of"
1605,II.,joyous and healthy life with which it has filled us; recalling the
1606,II.,"bright and thoughtless rhymes of Lorenzo dei Medici, of Politian, of"
1607,II.,"Bern!, and of Ariosto; the sweet and tender poetry of Bembo and Vittoria"
1608,II.,Colonna and Tasso; the bluff sensuality of novelists like Bandello and
1609,II.,"Masuccio, the Aristophanesque laughter of the comedy of Bibbiena and of"
1610,II.,Beolco; seeing in our mind's eye the stately sweet matrons and noble
1611,II.,"senators of Titian, the virginal saints and madonnas of Raphael, the"
1612,II.,joyous angels of Correggio;--recapitulating rapidly all our impressions
1613,II.,"of this splendid time of exuberant vitality, of this strong and serene"
1614,II.,"Renaissance, we answer without hesitation, and with only a smile of"
1615,II.,contempt at our credulous ancestors--no. The Italy of the Renaissance
1616,II.,"was, of all things that have ever existed or ever could exist, the most"
1617,II.,"utterly unlike the nightmare visions of men such as Webster and Ford,"
1618,II.,Marston and Tourneur. The only Elizabethan drama which really represents
1619,II.,"the Italy of the Renaissance is the comedy of Shakespeare, of Beaumont"
1620,II.,"and Fletcher, and of Ben Jonson and Massinger: to the Renaissance belong"
1621,II.,"those clear and sunny figures, the Portias, Antonios, Gratianos, Violas,"
1622,II.,"Petruchios, Bellarios, and Almiras; their faces do we see on the"
1623,II.,canvases of Titian and the frescoes of Raphael; they are the real
1624,II.,children of the Italian Renaissance. These frightful Brachianos and
1625,II.,Annabellas and Ferdinands and Corombonas and Vindicis and Pieros of the
1626,II.,"""White Devil,"" of the ""Duchess of Malfy,"" of the ""Revenger's Tragedy,"""
1627,II.,"and of ""Antonio and Mellida,"" are mere fantastic horrors, as false as"
1628,II.,"the Counts Udolpho, the Spalatros, the Zastrozzis, and all their"
1629,II.,grotesquely ghastly pseudo-Italian brethren of eighty years ago.
1630,II.,
1631,II.,"And, indeed, the Italy of the Renaissance, as represented in its"
1632,II.,"literature and its art, is the very negation of Elizabethan horrors. Of"
1633,II.,"all the mystery, the colossal horror and terror of our dramatists, there"
1634,II.,is not the faintest trace in the intellectual productions of the Italian
1635,II.,"Renaissance. The art is absolutely stainless: no scenes of horror, no"
1636,II.,"frightful martyrdoms, as with the Germans under Albrecht Dürer; no"
1637,II.,"abominable butcheries, as with the Bolognese of the seventeenth century;"
1638,II.,"no macerated saints and tattered assassins, as with the Spaniards; no"
1639,II.,"mystery, no contortion, no horrors: vigorous and serene beauty, pure and"
1640,II.,"cheerful life, real or ideal, on wall or canvas, in bronze or in marble."
1641,II.,"The literature is analogous to the art, only less perfect, more tainted"
1642,II.,"with the weakness of humanity, less ideal, more real. It is essentially"
1643,II.,"human, in the largest sense of the word; or if it cease, in creatures"
1644,II.,"like Aretine, to be humanly clean, it becomes merely satyr-like,"
1645,II.,"swinish, hircose. But it is never savage in lust or violence; it is"
1646,II.,quite free from the element of ferocity. It is essentially light and
1647,II.,"quiet and well regulated, sane and reasonable, never staggering or"
1648,II.,"blinded by excess: it is full of intelligent discrimination, of"
1649,II.,"intelligent leniency, of well-bred reserved sympathy; it is civilized as"
1650,II.,are the wide well-paved streets of Ferrara compared with the tortuous
1651,II.,"black alleys of mediæval Paris; as are the well-lit, clean, spacious"
1652,II.,"palaces of Michelozzo or Bramante compared with the squalid, unhealthy,"
1653,II.,uncomfortable mediæval castles of Dürer's etchings. It is indeed a
1654,II.,trifle too civilized; too civilized to produce every kind of artistic
1655,II.,fruit; it is--and here comes the crushing difference between the Italian
1656,II.,"Renaissance and our Elizabethans' pictures of it--it is, this beautiful"
1657,II.,"rich literature of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, completely"
1658,II.,deficient in every tragic element; it has intuition neither for tragic
1659,II.,event nor for tragic character; it affords not a single tragic page in
1660,II.,"its poems and novels; it is incapable, after the most laborious and"
1661,II.,"conscientious study of Euripides and Seneca, utterly and miserably"
1662,II.,"incapable of producing a single real tragedy, anything which is not a"
1663,II.,sugary pastoral or a pompous rhetorical exercise. The epic poets of the
1664,II.,"Italian Renaissance, Pulci, Boiardo, Berni, and Ariosto, even the"
1665,II.,"stately and sentimental Tasso, are no epic poets at all. They are mere"
1666,II.,"light and amusing gossips, some of them absolute buffoons. Their"
1667,II.,adventures over hill and dale are mere riding parties; their fights mere
1668,II.,"festival tournaments, their enchantments mere pageant wonders. Events"
1669,II.,"like the death of Hector, the slaughter of Penelope's suitors, the"
1670,II.,"festive massacre of Chriemhilt, the horrible deceit of Alfonso the"
1671,II.,Chaste sending Bernardo del Carpio his father's corpse on horseback--
1672,II.,things like these never enter their minds. When tragic events do by some
1673,II.,"accident come into their narration, they cease to be tragic; they are"
1674,II.,frittered away into mere pretty conceits like the death of Isabella and
1675,II.,"the sacrifice of Olympia in the ""Orlando Furioso;"" or melted down into"
1676,II.,"vague pathos, like the burning of Olindo and Sofronia, and the death of"
1677,II.,"Clorinda by the sentimental Tasso. Neither poet, the one with his"
1678,II.,"cheerfulness, the other with his mild melancholy, brings home, conceives"
1679,II.,the horror of the situation; the one treats the tragic in the spirit
1680,II.,"almost of burlesque, the other entirely in the spirit of elegy. So,"
1681,II.,"again, with the novel writers: these professional retailers of anecdotes"
1682,II.,will pick up any subject to fill their volumes. In default of pleasant
1683,II.,"stories of filthy intrigue or lewd jest, men like Cinthio and Bandello"
1684,II.,"will gabble off occasionally some tragic story, picked out of a history"
1685,II.,book or recently heard from a gossip: the stories of Harmodius and
1686,II.,"Aristogeiton, of Disdémona and the Moorish Captain, of Roméo Montecchio"
1687,II.,"and Giulietta Cappelletti, of the Cardinal d'Aragona and the Duchess of"
1688,II.,"Amalfi, of unknown grotesque Persian Sophis and Turkish Bassas--stories"
1689,II.,"of murder, massacre, rape, incest, anything and everything, prattled"
1690,II.,"off, with a few words of vapid compassion and stale moralizing, in the"
1691,II.,"serene, cheerful, chatty manner in which they recount their Decameronian"
1692,II.,"escapades or Rabelaisian repartees. As it is with tragic action, so is"
1693,II.,it with tragic character. The literature of the country which suggested
1694,II.,"to our Elizabethans their colossal villains, can display only a few"
1695,II.,"conventional monsters, fire-eating, swashbuckler Rodomonts and Sultan"
1696,II.,"Malechs, strutting and puffing like the grotesque villains of"
1697,II.,"puppet-shows; Aladins and Ismenos, enchanters and ogres fit to be put"
1698,II.,"into Don Quixote's library: mere conventional rag puppets, doubtless"
1699,II.,valued as such and no more by the shrewd contemporaries of Ariosto and
1700,II.,Tasso. The inhabitants of Tasso's world of romance are pale chivalric
1701,II.,"unrealities, lifeless as Spenser's half-allegoric knights and ladies;"
1702,II.,those of Pulci's Ardenne forests and Cathay deserts are buffoons such as
1703,II.,Florentine shopmen may have trapped out for their amusement in rusty
1704,II.,armour and garlands of sausages. The only lifelike heroes and heroines
1705,II.,"are those of Ariosto. And they are most untragic, unromantic. The men"
1706,II.,"are occasionally small scoundrels, but unintentionally on the part of"
1707,II.,the author. They show no deep moral cancers or plague-spots; they
1708,II.,display cheerfully all the petty dishonour and small lusts which the
1709,II.,Renaissance regarded as mere flesh and blood characteristics. So also
1710,II.,"Ariosto's ladies: the charming, bright women, coquettish or Amazonian,"
1711,II.,are frail and fickle to the degree which was permissible to a court
1712,II.,"lady, who should be neither prudish nor coquettish; doing unchaste"
1713,II.,"things and listening to unchaste words simply, gracefully, without"
1714,II.,"prurience or horror; perfectly well-bred, _gentili_, as Ariosto calls"
1715,II.,"them; prudent also, according to the notions of the day, in limiting"
1716,II.,their imprudence. The adventure of Fiordispina with Ricciardetto would
1717,II.,have branded an English serving-wench as a harlot; the behaviour of
1718,II.,Roger towards the lady he has just rescued from the sea-monster would
1719,II.,have blushingly been attributed by Spenser to one of his satyrs; but
1720,II.,these were escapades quite within Ariosto's notions of what was
1721,II.,permitted to a _gentil cavaliero_ and a _nobil donzella_; and if
1722,II.,"Fiordispina and Roger are not like Florimell and Sir Calidore, still"
1723,II.,less do they in the faintest degree resemble Tourneur and Marston's
1724,II.,Levidulcias and Isabellas and Lussuriosos. And with the exception
1725,II.,"perhaps, of this heroine and this hero, we cannot find any very great"
1726,II.,"harm in Ariosto's ladies and gentlemen: we may, indeed, feel indignant"
1727,II.,when we think that they replace the chaste and noble impossibilities of
1728,II.,"earlier romance, the Rolands and Percivals, the Beatrices and Lauras of"
1729,II.,"the past; when we consider that they represent for Ariosto, not the"
1730,II.,"bespattered but the spotless, not the real but the ideal. All this may"
1731,II.,awaken in us contempt and disgust; but if we consider these figures in
1732,II.,"themselves as realities, and compare them with the evil figures of our"
1733,II.,"drama, we find that they are mere venial sinners--light, fickle,"
1734,II.,"amorous, fibbing--very human in their faults; human, trifling, mild, not"
1735,II.,"at all monstrous, like all the art products of the Renaissance.[1]"
1736,II.,
1737,II.,
1738,II.,"[1] The ""Orlando Innamorato"" of Boiardo contains, part i, canto 8, a"
1739,II.,"story too horrible and grotesque for me to narrate, of a monster born of"
1740,II.,"Marchino and his murdered sister-in-law, which forms a strange exception"
1741,II.,"to my rule, even as does, for instance, Matteo di Giovanni's massacre of"
1742,II.,"the Innocents. Can this story have been suggested, a ghastly nightmare,"
1743,II.,"by the frightful tale of Sigismondo Malatesta and the beautiful Borbona,"
1744,II.,which was current in Boiardo's day?
1745,II.,
1746,II.,
1747,II.,"A serene and spotless art, a literature often impure but always"
1748,II.,"cheerful, rational, civilized--this is what the Italian Renaissance"
1749,II.,displays when we seek in it for spirits at all akin to Webster or Lope
1750,II.,"de Vega, to Holbein or Ribera. To find the tragic we must wait for the"
1751,II.,"Bolognese painters of the seventeenth century, for Metastasio and"
1752,II.,Alfieri in the eighteenth; it is useless seeking it in this serene and
1753,II.,"joyous Renaissance. Where, then, in the midst of these spotless virgins,"
1754,II.,"these noble saints, these brilliant pseudo-chivalric joustings and"
1755,II.,"revels, these sweet and sonneteering pastorals, these scurrilous"
1756,II.,adventures and loose buffooneries; where in this Italian Renaissance are
1757,II.,the horrors which fascinated so strangely our English playwrights: the
1758,II.,"fratricides and incests, the frightful crimes of lust and blood which"
1759,II.,haunted and half crazed the genius of Tourneur and Marston? Where in
1760,II.,this brilliant and courteous and humane and civilized nation are the
1761,II.,gigantic villains whose terrible features were drawn with such superb
1762,II.,awfulness of touch by Webster and Ford? Where in this Renaissance of
1763,II.,"Italian literature, so cheerful and light of conscience, is the foul and"
1764,II.,savage Renaissance of English tragedy? Does the art of Italy tell an
1765,II.,"impossible, universal lie? or is the art of England the victim of an"
1766,II.,"impossible, universal hallucination?"
1767,II.,
1768,II.,Neither; for art can neither tell lies nor be the victim of
1769,II.,"hallucination. The horror exists, and the light-heartedness exists; the"
1770,II.,"unhealthiness and the healthiness. For as, in that weird story by"
1771,II.,"Nathaniel Hawthorne, the daughter of the Paduan wizard is nurtured on"
1772,II.,"the sap and fruit and the emanations of poisonous plants, till they"
1773,II.,"become her natural sustenance, and she thrives and is strong and lovely;"
1774,II.,"while the youth, bred in the ordinary pure air and nourished on ordinary"
1775,II.,"wholesome food, faints and staggers as soon as he breathes the fatal"
1776,II.,"odours of the poison garden, and sinks down convulsed and crazed at the"
1777,II.,first touch of his mistress' blooming but death-breathing lips; so also
1778,II.,"the Italians, steeped in the sin of their country, seeing it daily and"
1779,II.,"hourly, remained intellectually healthy and serene; while the English,"
1780,II.,"coming from a purer moral atmosphere, were seized with strange moral"
1781,II.,sickness of horror at what they had seen and could not forget. And the
1782,II.,"nation which was chaste and true wrote tales of incest and treachery,"
1783,II.,while the nation which was foul and false wrote poetry of shepherds and
1784,II.,knights-errant.
1785,II.,
1786,II.,"The monstrous immorality of the Italian Renaissance, as I have elsewhere"
1787,II.,"shown in greater detail, was, like the immorality of any other"
1788,II.,"historical period, not a formal rebellion against God, but a natural"
1789,II.,result of the evolution of the modern world. The Italy of the
1790,II.,Renaissance was one of the many victims which inevitable moral sequence
1791,II.,dooms to be evil in order that others may learn to be good: it was a
1792,II.,"sacrifice which consisted in a sin, a sacrifice requiring frightful"
1793,II.,"expiation on the part of the victim. For Italy was subjected, during"
1794,II.,"well-nigh two centuries, to a slow process of moral destruction; a"
1795,II.,"process whose various factors--political disorganization, religious"
1796,II.,"indifference, scientific scepticism, wholesale enthusiasm for the"
1797,II.,"antique, breaking-up of mediæval standards and excessive growth of"
1798,II.,"industry, commerce, and speculative thought at the expense of warlike"
1799,II.,and religious habits--were at the same time factors in the great advent
1800,II.,"of modern civilization, of which Italy was the pioneer and the victim; a"
1801,II.,"process whose result was, in Italy, insensibly and inevitably to reduce"
1802,II.,to chaos the moral and political organization of the nation; at once
1803,II.,"rendering men completely unable to discriminate between good and evil,"
1804,II.,and enabling a certain proportion of them to sin with complete impunity:
1805,II.,"creating on the one hand moral indifference, and on the other social"
1806,II.,irresponsibility. Civilization had kept pace with demoralization; the
1807,II.,faculty of reasoning over cause and effect had developed at the expense
1808,II.,"of the faculty of judging of actions. The Italians of the Renaissance,"
1809,II.,"little by little, could judge only of the adaptation of means to given"
1810,II.,ends; whether means or ends were legitimate or illegitimate they soon
1811,II.,became unable to perceive and even unable to ask. Success was the
1812,II.,"criterion of all action, and power was its limits. Active and furious"
1813,II.,national wickedness there was not: there was mere moral inertia on the
1814,II.,part of the people. The Italians of the Renaissance neither resisted
1815,II.,"evil nor rebelled against virtue; they were indifferent to both, and a"
1816,II.,little pressure sufficed to determine them to either. In the governed
1817,II.,"classes, where the law was equal between men, and industry and commerce"
1818,II.,"kept up healthy activity, the pressure was towards good. The artizans"
1819,II.,"and merchants lived decent lives, endowed hospitals, listened to"
1820,II.,"edifying sermons, and were even moved (for a few moments) by men like"
1821,II.,"San Bernardino or Savonarola. In the governing classes, where all right"
1822,II.,"lay in force, where the necessity of self-defence induced treachery and"
1823,II.,"violence, and irresponsibility produced excess, the pressure was towards"
1824,II.,evil. The princelets and prelates and mercenery generals indulged in
1825,II.,"every sensuality, turned treachery into a science and violence into an"
1826,II.,instrument; and sometimes let themselves be intoxicated into mad lust
1827,II.,"and ferocity, as their subjects were occasionally intoxicated with mad"
1828,II.,"austerity and mysticism; but the excesses of mad vice, like the excesses"
1829,II.,"of mad virtue, lasted only a short time, or lasted only in individual"
1830,II.,saints or blood-maniacs; and the men of the Renaissance speedily
1831,II.,regained their level of indifferent righteousness and of indifferent
1832,II.,"sinfulness. Righteousness and sinfulness both passive, without power of"
1833,II.,"aggression or resistance, and consequently in strange and dreadful peace"
1834,II.,"with each other. The wicked men did not dislike virtue, nor the good men"
1835,II.,"vice: the villain could admire a saint, and the saint could condone a"
1836,II.,villain. The prudery of righteousness was as unknown as the cynicism of
1837,II.,"evil; the good man, like Guarino da Verona, would not shrink from the"
1838,II.,"foul man; the foul man, like Beccadelli, would not despise the pure man."
1839,II.,The ideally righteous citizen of Agnolo Pandolfini does not interfere
1840,II.,with the ideally unrighteous prince of Machiavelli: each has his own
1841,II.,"position and conduct; and who can say whether, if the positions were"
1842,II.,"exchanged, the conduct might not be exchanged also? In such a condition"
1843,II.,"of things as this, evil ceases to appear monstrous; it is explained,"
1844,II.,"endured, condoned. The stately philosophical historians, so stoically"
1845,II.,"grand, and the prattling local chroniclers, so highly coloured and so"
1846,II.,"gentle and graceful; Guicciardini and Machiavelli and Valori and Segni,"
1847,II.,"on the one hand--Corio, Allegretti, Matarazzo, Infessura, on the other;"
1848,II.,"all these, from whom we learn the real existence of immorality far more"
1849,II.,"universal and abominable than our dramatists venture to show, relate"
1850,II.,"quietly, calmly, with analytical frigidness or gossiping levity, the"
1851,II.,"things which we often shrink from repeating, and sometimes recoil from"
1852,II.,believing. Great statesmanlike historians and humble chattering
1853,II.,chroniclers are alike unaffected by what goes on around them: they
1854,II.,"collect anecdotes and generalize events without the fumes of evil, among"
1855,II.,which they seek for materials in the dark places of national or local
1856,II.,"history, ever going to their imagination, ever making their heart sicken"
1857,II.,"and faint, and their fancy stagger and reel. The life of these"
1858,II.,"righteous, or at least, not actively sinning men, may be hampered,"
1859,II.,"worried, embittered, or even broken by the villainy of their fellow-men;"
1860,II.,"but, except in some visionary monk, life can never be poisoned by the"
1861,II.,"mere knowledge of evil. Their town maybe betrayed to the enemy, their"
1862,II.,"daughters may be dishonoured or poisoned, their sons massacred; they"
1863,II.,"may, in their old age, be cast starving on the world, or imprisoned or"
1864,II.,broken by torture; and they will complain and be fierce in diatribe: the
1865,II.,"fiercest diatribe written against any Pope of the Renaissance being,"
1866,II.,"perhaps, that of Platina against Paul II., who was a saint compared with"
1867,II.,"his successors Sixtus and Alexander, because the writer of the diatribe"
1868,II.,"and his friends were maltreated by this pope. When personally touched,"
1869,II.,the Italians of the Renaissance will brook no villainy--the poniard
1870,II.,quickly despatches sovereigns like Galeazzo Maria Sforza; but when the
1871,II.,"villainy remains abstract, injures neither themselves nor their"
1872,II.,"immediate surroundings, it awakens no horror, and the man who commits it"
1873,II.,is by no means regarded as a fiend. The great criminals of the
1874,II.,"Renaissance--traitors and murderers like Lodovico Sforza, incestuous"
1875,II.,"parricides like Gianpaolo Baglioni, committers of every iniquity under"
1876,II.,"heaven like Cæsar Borgia--move through the scene of Renaissance history,"
1877,II.,"as shown by its writers great and small, quietly, serenely,"
1878,II.,"triumphantly; with gracious and magnanimous bearing; applauded, admired,"
1879,II.,"or at least endured. On their passage no man, historian or chronicler,"
1880,II.,"unless the agent of a hostile political faction, rises up, confronts"
1881,II.,"them and says, ""This man is a devil."""
1882,II.,
1883,II.,"And devils these men were not: the judgment of their contemporaries,"
1884,II.,"morally completely perverted, was probably psychologically correct; they"
1885,II.,"misjudged the deeds, but rarely, perhaps, misjudged the man. To us"
1886,II.,"moderns, as to our English ancestors of the sixteenth century, this is"
1887,II.,scarcely conceivable. A man who does devilish deeds is necessarily a
1888,II.,"devil; and the evil Italian princes of the Renaissance, the Borgias,"
1889,II.,"Sforzas, Baglionis, Malatestas, and Riarios appear, through the mist of"
1890,II.,"horrified imagination, so many uncouth and gigantic monsters, nightmare"
1891,II.,"shapes, less like human beings than like the grand and frightful angels"
1892,II.,of evil who gather round Milton's Satan in the infernal council. Such
1893,II.,"they appear to us. But if we once succeed in calmly looking at them,"
1894,II.,"seeing them not in the lurid lights and shadows of our fancy, but in the"
1895,II.,"daylight of contemporary reality, we shall little by little be forced to"
1896,II.,confess (and the confession is horrible) that most of these men are
1897,II.,"neither abnormal nor gigantic. Their times were monstrous, not they."
1898,II.,"They were not, that is clear, at variance with the moral atmosphere"
1899,II.,which surrounded them; and they were the direct result of the social and
1900,II.,political condition. This may seem no answer; for although we know the
1901,II.,"causes of monster births, they are monstrous none the less. What we mean"
1902,II.,is not that the existence of men capable of committing such actions was
1903,II.,"normal; we mean that the men who committed them, the conditions being"
1904,II.,"what they were, were not necessarily men of exceptional character. The"
1905,II.,level of immorality was so high that a man need be no giant to reach up
1906,II.,into the very seventh heaven of iniquity. When to massacre at a banquet
1907,II.,a number of enemies enticed by overtures of peace was considered in
1908,II.,"Cæsar Borgia merely a rather audacious and not very holy action,"
1909,II.,"indicative of very brilliant powers of diplomacy, then Cæsar Borgia"
1910,II.,"required, to commit such an action, little more than a brilliant"
1911,II.,"diplomatic endowment, unhampered by scruples and timidity; when a brave,"
1912,II.,and gracious prince like Gianpaolo Baglioni could murder his kinsmen and
1913,II.,commit incest with his sister without being considered less gracious and
1914,II.,"magnanimous, then Gianpaolo Baglioni might indeed be but an indifferent"
1915,II.,"villain; when treachery, lust, and bloodshed, although objected to in"
1916,II.,"theory, were condoned In practice, and were regarded as venial sins,"
1917,II.,those who indulged in them might be in fact scarcely more than venial
1918,II.,"sinners. In short, where a fiendish action might be committed without"
1919,II.,"the perpetrator being considered a fiend, there was no need of his being"
1920,II.,"one. And, indeed, the great villains of the Renaissance never take up"
1921,II.,"the attitude of fiends; one or two, like certain Visconti or Aragonese,"
1922,II.,"were madmen, but the others were more or less normal human beings. There"
1923,II.,"was no barrier between them and evil; they slipped into it, remained in"
1924,II.,"it, became accustomed to it; but a vicious determination to be wicked, a"
1925,II.,"feeling of the fiend within one, like that of Shakespeare's Richard, or"
1926,II.,"a gradual, conscious irresistible absorption into recognized iniquity"
1927,II.,"like Macbeth's, there was not. The mere sense of absolute power and"
1928,II.,"impunity, together with the complete silence of the conscience of the"
1929,II.,"public at large, can make a man do strange things. If Cæsar Borgia be"
1930,II.,"free to practise his archery upon hares and deer, why should he not"
1931,II.,practise it upon these prisoners? Who will blame him? Who can prevent
1932,II.,him? If he had for his mistress every woman he might single out from
1933,II.,"among his captives, why not his sister? If he have the force to carry"
1934,II.,"out a plan, why should a man stand in his way? The complete facility in"
1935,II.,the commission of all actions quickly brings such a man to the limits of
1936,II.,the legitimate: there is no universal cry to tell him where those limits
1937,II.,"are, no universal arm to pull him back. He pooh-poohs, pushes them a"
1938,II.,"little further, and does the iniquity. Nothing prevents his gratifying"
1939,II.,"his ambition, his avarice, and his lust, so he gratifies them. Soon,"
1940,II.,"seeking for further gratification, he has to cut new paths in villainy:"
1941,II.,"he has not been restrained by man, who is silent; he is soon restrained"
1942,II.,"no longer by nature, whose only voice is in man's conscience. Pleasure"
1943,II.,in wanton cruelty takes the same course: he prefers to throw javelins at
1944,II.,"men and women to throwing javelins at bulls or bears, even as he prefers"
1945,II.,throwing javelins at bulls or bears rather than at targets; the
1946,II.,excitement is greater; the instinct is that of the soldiers of Spain and
1947,II.,"of France, who invariably preferred shooting at a valuable fresco like"
1948,II.,"Sodoma's Christ, at Siena, or Lo Spagna's Madonna, at Spoleto, to"
1949,II.,practising against a mere worthless piece of wood. Such a man as Cæsar
1950,II.,"Borgia is the _nec plus ultra_ of a Renaissance villain; he takes, as"
1951,II.,"all do not, absolute pleasure in evil as such. Yet Cæsar Borgia is not a"
1952,II.,fiend nor a maniac. He can restrain himself whenever circumstances or
1953,II.,"policy require it; he can be a wise administrator, a just judge. His"
1954,II.,"portraits show no degraded criminal; he is, indeed, a criminal in"
1955,II.,"action, but not necessarily a criminal in constitution, this fiendish"
1956,II.,man who did not seem a fiend to Machiavel. We are astonished at the
1957,II.,strange anomaly in the tastes and deeds of these Renaissance villains;
1958,II.,"we are amazed before their portraits. These men, who, in the frightful"
1959,II.,"light of their own misdeeds, appear to us as complete demons or complete"
1960,II.,"madmen, have yet much that is amiable and much that is sane; they"
1961,II.,"stickle at no abominable lust, yet they are no bestial sybarites; they"
1962,II.,"are brave, sober, frugal, enduring like any puritan; they are"
1963,II.,"treacherous, rapacious, cruel, utterly indifferent to the sufferings of"
1964,II.,"their enemies, yet they are gentle in manner, passionately fond of"
1965,II.,"letters and art, superb in their works of public utility, and not"
1966,II.,incapable of genuinely admiring men of pure life like Bernardino or
1967,II.,"Savonarola: they are often, strange to say, like the frightful Baglionis"
1968,II.,"of Perugia, passionately admired and loved by their countrymen. The"
1969,II.,"bodily portraits of these men, painted by the sternly realistic art of"
1970,II.,"the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, are even more confusing to"
1971,II.,our ideas than their moral portraits drawn by historians and
1972,II.,"chroniclers. Cæsar Borgia, with his long fine features and noble head,"
1973,II.,"is a gracious and refined prince; there is, perhaps, a certain duplicity"
1974,II.,"in the well-cut lips; the beard, worn full and peaked in Spanish"
1975,II.,"fashion, forms a sort of mask to the lower part of the face, but what we"
1976,II.,see is noble and intellectual. Sigismondo Malatesta has on his medals a
1977,II.,head whose scowl has afforded opportunity for various fine descriptions
1978,II.,"of a blood maniac; but the head, thus found so expressive, of this"
1979,II.,"monster, is infinitely more human than the head on the medals of"
1980,II.,"Lionello d'Este, one of the most mild and cultivated of the decently"
1981,II.,"behaved Ferrarese princes. The very flower of precocious iniquity, the"
1982,II.,"young Baglionis, Vitellis, and Orsinis, grouped round Signorelli's"
1983,II.,"preaching Antichrist at Orvieto, are, in their gallantly trimmed jerkins"
1984,II.,"and jewelled caps, the veriest assemblage of harmless young dandies,"
1985,II.,pretty and insipid; we can scarcely believe that these mild beardless
1986,II.,"striplings, tight-waisted and well-curled like girls of sixteen, are the"
1987,II.,"terrible Umbrian brigand condottieri--Gianpaolos, Simonettos,"
1988,II.,"Vitellozzos, and Astorres--whose abominable deeds fill the pages of the"
1989,II.,"chronicles of Matarazzo, of Frolliere, of Monaldeschi. Nowhere among the"
1990,II.,portraits of Renaissance monsters do we meet with anything like those
1991,II.,"Roman emperors, whose frightful effigies, tumid, toad-like Vitelliuses"
1992,II.,"or rage-convulsed Caracallas, fill all our museums in marble or bronze"
1993,II.,or loathsome purple porphyry; such types as these are as foreign to the
1994,II.,reality of the Italian Renaissance as are the Brachianos and
1995,II.,"Lussuriosos, the Pieros and Corombonas, to the Italian fiction of the"
1996,II.,sixteenth century.
1997,II.,
1998,II.,"Nor must such anomalies between the type of the men and their deeds,"
1999,II.,"between their abominable crimes and their high qualities, be merely made"
2000,II.,"a subject for grandiloquent disquisition. The man of the Renaissance, as"
2001,II.,"we have said, had no need to be a monster to do monstrous things; a"
2002,II.,crime did not necessitate such a moral rebellion as requires complete
2003,II.,"unity of nature, unmixed wickedness; it did not precipitate a man for"
2004,II.,ever into a moral abyss where no good could ever enter. Seeing no
2005,II.,"barrier between the legitimate and the illegitimate, he could alternate"
2006,II.,"almost unconsciously between them. He was never shut out from evil, and"
2007,II.,never shut out from good; the judgment of men did not dress him in a
2008,II.,convict's jacket which made evil his only companion; it did not lock him
2009,II.,up in a moral dungeon where no ray of righteousness could enter; he was
2010,II.,"not condemned, like the branded harlot, to hopeless infamy. He need be"
2011,II.,"bad only as much and as long as he chose. Hence, on the part of the"
2012,II.,"evil-doer of the Renaissance, no necessity either for violent rebellion"
2013,II.,or for sincere repentance; hence the absence of all characters such as
2014,II.,"the tragic writer seeks, developed by moral struggle, warped by the"
2015,II.,"triumph of vice, or consciously soiled in virtue. What a ""Revenger's"
2016,II.,"Tragedy"" might not Cyril Tourneur have made, had he known all the"
2017,II.,"details, of the story of Alessandro de' Medici's death! What a Vindici"
2018,II.,he would have made of the murderer Lorenzino; with what a strange lurid
2019,II.,grandeur he would have surrounded the plottings of the pander Brutus.
2020,II.,But Lorenzino de' Medici had none of the feeling of Tourneur's Vindici;
2021,II.,there was in him none of the ghastly spirit of self-immolation of the
2022,II.,hero of Tourneur in his attendance upon the foul creature whom he leads
2023,II.,"to his death. Lorenzino had the usual Brutus mania of his day, but"
2024,II.,unmixed with horror. To be the pander and jester of the Duke was no pain
2025,II.,to his nature; there was probably no sense of debasement in the
2026,II.,knowledge either of his employer or of his employment. To fasten on
2027,II.,"Alexander, to pretend to be his devoted slave and server of his lust,"
2028,II.,"this piece of loathsome acting, merely enhanced, by the ingenuity it"
2029,II.,"required, the attraction of what to Lorenzino was an act of heroism. His"
2030,II.,ambition was to be a Brutus; that he had bespattered the part probably
2031,II.,never occurred to him. The indifference to good and evil permitted the
2032,II.,"men of the Renaissance to mix the two without any moral sickness, as it"
2033,II.,permitted them to alternate them without a moral struggle. Such is the
2034,II.,wickedness of the Renaissance: not a superhuman fury of lust and
2035,II.,"cruelty, like Victor Hugo's Lucrezia Borgia; but an indifferent, a"
2036,II.,characterless creature like the Lucrezia Borgia of history: passive to
2037,II.,"surrounding influences, blind to good and evil, infamous in the infamous"
2038,II.,"Rome, among her father and brother's courtesans and cut-throats; grave"
2039,II.,"and gracious! in the grave and gracious Ferrara, among the Platonic"
2040,II.,"poets and pacific courtiers of the court of the Estensi. Thus, in the"
2041,II.,"complete prose and colourlessness of reality, has the evil of the"
2042,II.,"Renaissance been understood and represented only by one man, and"
2043,II.,transmitted to us in one pale and delicate psychological masterpiece far
2044,II.,more loathsome than any elaborately hideous monster painting by Marston
2045,II.,or Tourneur. The man who thus conceived the horrors of the Italian
2046,II.,Renaissance in the spirit in which they were committed is Ford. In his
2047,II.,great play he has caught the very tone of the Italian Renaissance: the
2048,II.,abominableness of the play consisting not in the coarse slaughter scenes
2049,II.,"added merely to please the cockpit of an English theatre, but in the"
2050,II.,superficial innocence of tone; in its making evil lose its appearance of
2051,II.,"evil, even as it did to the men of the Renaissance. Giovanni and"
2052,II.,Annabella make love as if they were Romeo and Juliet: there is scarcely
2053,II.,"any struggle, and no remorse; they weep and pay compliments and sigh and"
2054,II.,melt in true Aminta style. There is in the love of the brother and
2055,II.,"sister neither the ferocious heat of tragic lust, nor the awful shudder"
2056,II.,"of unnatural evil; they are lukewarm, neither good nor bad. Their"
2057,II.,abominable love is in their own eyes a mere weakness of the flesh; there
2058,II.,is no sense of revolt against man and nature and God; they are neither
2059,II.,dragged on by irresistible demoniac force nor held back by the grip of
2060,II.,"conscience; they slip and slide, even like Francesca and Paolo. They pay"
2061,II.,each other sweet and mawkish compliments. The ferocious lust of
2062,II.,"Francesco Cenci is moral compared with the way in which the ""trim youth"""
2063,II.,"Giovanni praises Annabella's beauty; the blushing, bride-like way in"
2064,II.,"which Annabella, ""white in her soul,"" acknowledges her long love. The"
2065,II.,"atrociousness of all this is, that if you strike out a word or two the"
2066,II.,"scene may be read with perfect moral satisfaction, with the impression"
2067,II.,"that this is really ""sacred love."" For in these scenes Ford wrote with a"
2068,II.,"sweetness and innocence truly diabolical, not a shiver of horror passing"
2069,II.,"through him--serene, unconscious; handling the filthy without sense of"
2070,II.,"its being unclean, to the extent, the incredible extent, of making"
2071,II.,Giovanni and Annabella swear on their mother's ashes eternal fidelity in
2072,II.,"incest: horror of horrors, to which no Walpurgis Night abomination could"
2073,II.,"ever approach, this taking as witness of the unutterable, not an obscene"
2074,II.,"Beelzebub with abominable words and rites, but the very holiest of"
2075,II.,holies. If ever Englishman approached the temper of the Italian
2076,II.,"Renaissance, it was not Tourneur, nor Shelley with his cleansing hell"
2077,II.,"fires of tragic horror, but this sweet and gentle Ford. If ever an"
2078,II.,artistic picture approached the reality of such a man as Gianpaolo
2079,II.,"Baglioni, the incestuous murderer whom the Frolliere chronicler,"
2080,II.,"enthusiastic like Matarazzo, admires, for ""his most beautiful person,"
2081,II.,"his benign and amiable manner and lordly bearing,"" it is certainly not"
2082,II.,"the elaborately villainous Francesco Cenci of Shelley, boasting like"
2083,II.,"another Satan of his enormous wickedness, exhausting in his picture of"
2084,II.,"himself the rhetoric of horror, committing his final enormity merely to"
2085,II.,complete the crown of atrocities in which he glories; it is no such
2086,II.,tragic impossibility of moral hideousness as this; it is the Giovanni of
2087,II.,"Ford, the pearl of virtuous and studious youths, the spotless, the"
2088,II.,"brave, who, after a moment's reasoning, tramples on a vulgar"
2089,II.,"prejudice--""Shall a peevish sound, a customary form from man to man, of"
2090,II.,"brother and of sister, be a bar 'twixt my eternal happiness and me?"" who"
2091,II.,"sins with a clear conscience, defies the world, and dies, bravely,"
2092,II.,"proudly, the ""sacred name"" of Annabella on his lips, like a chivalrous"
2093,II.,"hero. The pious, pure Germany of Luther will give the world the tragic"
2094,II.,type of the science-damned Faustus; the devout and savage Spain of
2095,II.,"Cervantes will give the tragic type of Don Juan, damned for mockery of"
2096,II.,man and of death and of heaven; the Puritan England of Milton will give
2097,II.,"the most sublimely tragic type of all, the awful figure of him who says,"
2098,II.,"""Evil, be thou my good."" What tragic type can this evil Italy of"
2099,II.,"Renaissance give to the world? None: or at most this miserable, morbid,"
2100,II.,"compassionated Giovanni: whom Ford would have us admire, and whom we can"
2101,II.,only despise.
2102,II.,
2103,II.,The blindness to evil which constitutes the criminality of the
2104,II.,Renaissance is so great as to give a certain air of innocence. For the
2105,II.,men of that time were wicked solely from a complete sophistication of
2106,II.,"ideas, a complete melting away (owing to slowly operating political and"
2107,II.,intellectual tendencies) of all moral barriers. They walked through the
2108,II.,paths of wickedness with the serenity with which they would have trod
2109,II.,"the ways of righteousness; seeing no boundary, exercising their psychic"
2110,II.,limbs equally in the open and permitted spaces and in the forbidden.
2111,II.,"They plucked the fruit of evil without a glance behind them, without a"
2112,II.,"desperate setting of their teeth; plucked it openly, calmly, as they"
2113,II.,"would have plucked the blackberries in the hedge; bit into it, ate it,"
2114,II.,"with perfect ease and serenity, saying their prayers before and after,"
2115,II.,as if it were their natural daily bread mentioned in the Lord's Prayer;
2116,II.,no grimace or unseemly leer the while; no moral indigestion or nightmare
2117,II.,(except very rarely) in consequence. Hence the serenity of their
2118,II.,"literature and art. These men and women of the Italian Renaissance have,"
2119,II.,"in their portraits, a very pleasing nobility of aspect: serene,"
2120,II.,"thoughtful, healthy, benign. Titian's courtesans are our archetypes of"
2121,II.,"dignified womanhood; we might fancy Portia or Isabella with such calm,"
2122,II.,"florid beauty, so wholly unmeretricious and uncankered. The humanists"
2123,II.,and priests who lie outstretched on the acanthus-leaved and
2124,II.,flower-garlanded sarcophagi by Desiderio and Rossellino are the very
2125,II.,flowers of refined and gentle men of study; the youths in Botticelli's
2126,II.,"""Adoration of The Magi,"" for instance, are the ideal of Boiardo's"
2127,II.,"chivalry, Rinaldos and Orlandos every one; the corseleted generals of"
2128,II.,"the Renaissance, so calm and stern and frank, the Bartolomeo Colleoni of"
2129,II.,"Verrocchio, the Gattamelata by Giorgione (or Giorgione's pupil), look"
2130,II.,fit to take up the banner of the crusade: that Gattamelata in the Uffizi
2131,II.,gallery especially looks like a sort of military Milton: give him a pair
2132,II.,"of wings and he becomes at once Signorelli's archangel, clothed in"
2133,II.,heavenly steel and unsheathing the flaming sword of God. Compare with
2134,II.,these types Holbein's courtiers of Henry VIII.; what scrofulous hogs!
2135,II.,Compare Sanchez Coello's Philip II. and Don Carlos; what monomaniacs.
2136,II.,Compare even Dürer's magnificent head of Willibald Pirkheimer: how the
2137,II.,"swine nature is blended with the thinker. And the swine will be subdued,"
2138,II.,the thinker will triumph. Why? Just because there is a contest--because
2139,II.,the thinker-Willibald is conscious of the swine-Willibald. In this
2140,II.,"coarse, brutal, deeply stained Germany of the time of Luther, affording"
2141,II.,"Dürer and Holbein, alas! how many besotten and bestial types, there will"
2142,II.,arise a great conflict: the obscene leering Death--Death-in-Life as he
2143,II.,"really is--will skulk everywhere, even as in the prints of the day,"
2144,II.,"hideous and powerful, trying, with hog's snout, to drive Christ Himself"
2145,II.,"out of limbo; but he is known, seen, dreaded. The armed knight of Dürer"
2146,II.,"turns away from his grimacings, and urges on his steel-covered horse. He"
2147,II.,"visits even the best, even Luther in the Wartburg; but the good men open"
2148,II.,"their Bibles, cry ""Vade retro!"" and throw their inkstands at him,"
2149,II.,showing themselves terrified and ruffled after the combat. And these
2150,II.,Germans of Luther's are disgustingly fond of blood and horrors: they
2151,II.,"like to see the blood spirt from the decapitated trunk, to watch its"
2152,II.,"last contortions; they hammer with a will (in Dürer's ""Passion"") the"
2153,II.,"nails of the cross, they peel off strips of skin in the flagellation."
2154,II.,"But then they can master all that; they can be pure, charitable; they"
2155,II.,"have gentleness for the hare and the rabbit, like Luther; they kneel"
2156,II.,"piously before the cross-bearing stag, like Saint Hubert. Not so the"
2157,II.,"Italians. They rarely or never paint horrors, or death, or abominations."
2158,II.,"Their flagellated Christ, their arrow-riddled Sebastian, never writhe or"
2159,II.,"howl with pain; indeed, they suffer none. Judith, in Mantegna's print,"
2160,II.,puts the head of Holophernes into her bag with the serenity of a muse;
2161,II.,"and the head is quite clean, without loathsome drippings or torn"
2162,II.,"depending strings of muscle; unconvulsed, a sort of plaster cast. The"
2163,II.,"tragedy of Christ, the tragedy of Judith; the physical agency shadowing"
2164,II.,the moral agony; the awfulness of victim and criminal--the whole tragic
2165,II.,"meaning was unknown to the light and cheerful contemporaries of Ariosto,"
2166,II.,the cold and cynical contemporaries of Machiavelli.
2167,II.,
2168,II.,"The tragic passion and imagination which, in the noble and grotesque"
2169,II.,"immaturity of the Middle Ages, had murmured confusedly in the popular"
2170,II.,"legends which gave to Ezzelin the Fiend as a father, and Death and Sin"
2171,II.,as adversaries at dice; which had stammered awkwardly but grandly in the
2172,II.,"school Latin of Mussato's tragedy of ""Eccerinis;"" which had wept and"
2173,II.,stormed and imprecated and laughed for horror in the infinite
2174,II.,"tragedy--pathetic, grand, and grotesque, like all great tragedy--of"
2175,II.,"Dante; this tragic passion and imagination, this sense of the horrible"
2176,II.,"and the terrible, had been forfeited by the Italy of the Renaissance,"
2177,II.,"lost with its sense of right and wrong. The Italian Renaissance, supreme"
2178,II.,in the arts which require a subtle and strong perception of the
2179,II.,"excellence of mere lines and colours and lights and shadows, which"
2180,II.,demand unflinching judgment of material qualities; was condemned to
2181,II.,inferiority in the art which requires subtle and strong perception of
2182,II.,the excellence of human emotion and action; in the art which demands
2183,II.,unflinching judgment of moral motives. The tragic spirit is the
2184,II.,offspring of the conscience of a people. The sense of the imaginative
2185,II.,grandeur of evil may perhaps be a forerunner of demoralization; but such
2186,II.,"a sense of wonder and awe, such an imaginative fascination of the"
2187,II.,"grandly, superhumanly wicked such a necessity to magnify a villain into"
2188,II.,"a demon with archangelic splendour of power of evil, can exist only in"
2189,II.,"minds pure and strong, braced up to virtue, virgin of evil, with a"
2190,II.,certain childlike power of wonder; minds to whom it appears that to be
2191,II.,wicked requires a powerful rebellion; minds accustomed to nature and
2192,II.,"nature's plainness, to whom the unnatural can be no subject of"
2193,II.,"sophistication and cynicism, but only of wonder. While, in Italy,"
2194,II.,Giraldi Cinthio prattles off to a gay party of ladies and gentlemen
2195,II.,"stories of murder and lust as frightful as those of ""Titus' Andronicus,"""
2196,II.,"of ""Giovanni and Annabella,"" and of the ""Revenger's Tragedy,"" in the"
2197,II.,"intelligent, bantering tone in which he tells his Decameronian tales; in"
2198,II.,"England, Marston, in his superb prologue to the second part of ""Antonio"
2199,II.,"and Mellida,"" doubts whether all his audience can rise to the conception"
2200,II.,of the terrible passions he wishes to display:
2201,II.,
2202,II.,
2203,II.,If any spirit breathes within this round
2204,II.,"Uncapable of weighty passion,"
2205,II.,Who winks and shuts his apprehension up
2206,II.,"From common sense of what men were and are,"
2207,II.,Who would not know what men must be: let such
2208,II.,Hurry amain from our black visaged shows;
2209,II.,We shall affright their eyes.
2210,II.,
2211,II.,
2212,II.,The great criminals of Italy were unconscious of being criminals; the
2213,II.,nation was unconscious of being sinful. Bembo's sonnets were the fit
2214,II.,reading for Lucrezia Borgia; pastorals by Guarini the dramatic
2215,II.,amusements of Rannuccio Farnesi; if Vittoria Accoramboni and Francesco
2216,II.,"Cenci read anything besides their prayerbook or ribald novels, it was"
2217,II.,"some sugary ""Aminta"" or ""Pastor Fido:"" their own tragedies by Webster"
2218,II.,and Shelley they could never have understood.
2219,II.,
2220,II.,And thus the Italians of the Renaissance walked placidly through the
2221,II.,"evil which surrounded them; for them, artists and poets, the sky was"
2222,II.,"always blue and the sun always bright, and their art and their poetry"
2223,II.,were serene. But the Englishmen of the sixteenth century were astonished
2224,II.,"and fascinated by the evil of Italy: the dark pools of horror, the dabs"
2225,II.,of infamy which had met them ever and anon in the brilliant southern
2226,II.,"cities, haunted them like nightmare, bespattered for them the clear blue"
2227,II.,"sky, and danced, black and horrible spots, before the face of the sun."
2228,II.,"The remembrance of Italian wickedness weighed on them like an incubus,"
2229,II.,clung to them with a frightful fascination. While the foulest criminals
2230,II.,"of Italy discussed the platonic vapidnesses of Bembo's sonnets, and wept"
2231,II.,at the sweet and languid lamentations of Guarini's shepherds and nymphs;
2232,II.,"the strong Englishmen of the time of Shakespeare, the men whose children"
2233,II.,"were to unsheathe under Cromwell the sword of righteousness, listened"
2234,II.,"awe-stricken and fascinated with horror to the gloomy and convulsed, the"
2235,II.,grand and frightful plays of Webster and of Tourneur. And the sin of the
2236,II.,"Renaissance, which the art of Italy could neither pourtray nor perceive;"
2237,II.,appeared on the stage decked in superb and awful garb by the tragic
2238,II.,imagination of Elizabethan England.

2243,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.
2244,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2245,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2246,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,The thought of winter is bleak and barren to our mind; the late year is
2247,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,chary of æsthetic as of all other food. In the country it does not bring
2248,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"ugliness; but it terribly reduces and simplifies things, depriving them"
2249,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of two-thirds of their beauty. In sweeping away the last yellow leaves,"
2250,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the last crimson clouds, and in bleaching the last green grass, it"
2251,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,effaces a whole wealth of colour. It deprives us still more by actually
2252,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"diminishing the number of forms: for what summer had left rich, various,"
2253,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"complex, winter reduces to blank uniformity. There is a whole world of"
2254,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"lovely things, shapes and tints, effects of light, colour, and"
2255,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"perspective in a wood, as long as it is capriciously divided into a"
2256,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"thousand nooks and crannies by projecting boughs, bushes, hedges, and"
2257,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,hanging leaves; and this winter clears away and reduces to a
2258,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Haussmanized simplicity of plan. There is a smaller world, yet one quite"
2259,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"big enough for a summer's day, in any hay field, among the barren oats,"
2260,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the moon-daisies, the seeded grasses, the sorrel, the buttercups, all"
2261,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,making at a distance a wonderful blent effect of luminous brown and
2262,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"lilac and russet foamed with white; and forming, when you look close"
2263,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"into it, an unlimited forest of delicately separate stems and bloom and"
2264,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,seed; every plant detaching itself daintily from an undefinable
2265,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,background of things like itself. This winter turns into a rusty brown
2266,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and green expanse, or into a bog, or a field of frozen upturned clods."
2267,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"The very trees, stripped of their leaves, look as if prepared for"
2268,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"diagrams of the abstraction tree. Everything, in short, is reduced most"
2269,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,philosophically to its absolutely ultimate elements; and beauty is got
2270,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,rid of almost as completely as by a metaphysical definition. This
2271,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"æsthetic barrenness of winter is most of all felt in southern climates,"
2272,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,to which it brings none of the harsh glitter and glamour of snow and
2273,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"ice; but leaves the frozen earth and leafless trees merely bare, without"
2274,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the crisp sheen of snow, the glint and glimmer of frost and icicles,"
2275,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,forming for the denuded rigging of branches a fantastic system of ropes
2276,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and folded sails. In the South, therefore, unless you go where winter"
2277,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"never comes, and autumn merely merges into a lengthened spring, winter"
2278,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"is more than ever negative, dreary, barren to our fancy. Yet even this"
2279,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"southern winter gives one things, very lovely things: things which one"
2280,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"scarcely notices perhaps, yet which would baffle the most skilled"
2281,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"painter to imitate, the most skilled poet to describe. Thus, for"
2282,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"instance, there is a peculiar kind of morning by no means uncommon in"
2283,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Tuscany in what is completely winter, not a remnant of autumn or a"
2284,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"beginning of spring. It is cold, but windless; the sky full of sun, the"
2285,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,earth full of mist. Sun and mist uniting into a pale luminousness in
2286,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"which all things lose body, become mere outline; bodiless hills taking"
2287,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,shape where they touch the sky with their curve; clear line of irregular
2288,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"houses, of projecting ilex roundings and pointed cypresses marking the"
2289,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"separation between hill and sky, the one scarcely more solid, corporeal"
2290,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"than the other; the hill almost as blue as the sky, the sky almost as"
2291,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,vaporous as the hill; the tangible often more ghostlike than the
2292,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"intangible. But the sun has smitten the higher hills, and the vapours"
2293,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"have partially rolled down, in a scarcely visible fold, to their feet;"
2294,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and the high hill, not yet rock or earth, swells up into the sky as"
2295,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"something real, but fluid and of infinite elasticity. All in front the"
2296,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,plain is white with mist; or pinkish grey with the unseen agglomeration
2297,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of bare tree boughs and trunks, of sere field; till, nearer us, the"
2298,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"trees become more visible, the short vinebearing elms in the fields,"
2299,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"interlacing their branches compressed by distance, the clumps of"
2300,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"poplars, so scant and far between from nearly, so serried and compact"
2301,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"from afar; and between them an occasional flush, a tawny vapour of the"
2302,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"orange twigged osiers; and then, still nearer, the expanse of sere"
2303,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"field, of mottled, crushed-together, yellowed grass and grey brown"
2304,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,leaves; things of the summer which winter is burying to make room for
2305,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,spring. Along the reaches of the river the clumps of leafless poplars
2306,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"are grey against the pale, palest blue sky; grey but with a warmth of"
2307,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"delicate brown, almost of rosiness. Grey also the shingle in the river"
2308,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"bed; the river itself either (if after rain) pale brown, streaked with"
2309,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"pale blue sky reflections; or (after a drought), low, grey, luminous"
2310,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"throughout its surface, you might think, were it not that the metallic"
2311,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sheen, the vacillating sparkles of where the sun, smiting down, frets it"
2312,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"into a shifting mass of scintillating facets, gives you the impression"
2313,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,that this other luminousness of silvery water must be dull and dead.
2314,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"And, looking up the river, it gradually disappears, its place marked"
2315,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"only, against the all-pervading pale blue haze, by the brownish grey"
2316,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,spectre of the furthest poplar clumps.
2317,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2318,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"This, I have said, is an effect which winter produces, nay, even a"
2319,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"southern winter, with those comparatively few and slight elements at its"
2320,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"disposal. We see it, notice it, and enjoy its delicate loveliness; but"
2321,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"while so doing we do not think, or we forget, that the habit of"
2322,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"noticing, nay, the power of perceiving such effects as this, is one of"
2323,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"those habits and powers which we possess, so to speak, only since"
2324,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,yesterday. The possibility of reproducing in painting effects like this
2325,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"one; or, more truthfully, the wish to reproduce them, is scarcely as old"
2326,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"as our own century; it is, perhaps, the latest born of all our artistic"
2327,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,wishes and possibilities. But the possibility of any visible effect
2328,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"being perceived and reproduced by the painter, usually precedes--at"
2329,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,least where any kind of pictorial art already exists--the perception of
2330,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"such effects by those who are not painters, and the attempt to reproduce"
2331,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,them by means of words. We do not care to admit that our grandfathers
2332,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"were too unlike ourselves, lest ourselves should be found too unlike our"
2333,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,grandchildren. We hold to the metaphysic fiction of man having always
2334,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"been the same, and only his circumstances having changed; not admitting"
2335,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,that the very change of circumstances implies something new in the man
2336,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,who altered them; and similarly we shrink from the thought of the many
2337,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"things which we used never to notice, and which it has required a class"
2338,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of men endowed with special powers of vision to find out, copy, and"
2339,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,teach us to see and appreciate. Yet there is scarcely one of us who has
2340,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,not a debt towards some painter or writer for first directing his
2341,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"attention to objects or effects which may have abounded around him, but"
2342,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"unnoticed or confused with others. The painters, as I have said, the men"
2343,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"who see more keenly and who study what they have seen, naturally come"
2344,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,first; nor does the poet usually describe what his contemporary painter
2345,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"attempts not to paint. An exception might, perhaps, require to be made"
2346,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"for Dante, who would seem to have seen and described many things left"
2347,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"quite untouched by Giotto, and even by Raphael; but in estimating Dante"
2348,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,we must be careful to distinguish the few touches which really belong to
2349,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"him, from the great mass of colour and detail which we have"
2350,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"unconsciously added thereto, borrowing from our own experience and from"
2351,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"innumerable pictures and poems which, at the moment, we may not in the"
2352,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"least remember; and having done so, we shall be led to believe that"
2353,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,those words which suggest to us so clear and coloured a vision of scenes
2354,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"often complex and uncommon, presented to his own mind only a"
2355,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"comparatively simple and incomplete idea: the atmospheric effects,"
2356,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"requiring a more modern painter than Turner, which we read between the"
2357,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"lines of the ""Inferno"" and the ""Purgatorio,"" most probably existed as"
2358,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,little for Dante as they did for Giotto; the poet seeing and describing
2359,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"in reality only salient forms of earth and rock, monotonous in tint and"
2360,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"deficient in air, like those in the backgrounds of mediæval Tuscan"
2361,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"frescoes and panels. Be this as it may, the fact grows daily on me that"
2362,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,men have not at all times seen in the same degree the nature which has
2363,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"always equally surrounded them; and that during some periods they have,"
2364,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"for explicable reasons, seen less not only than their successors, but"
2365,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,also than their predecessors; and seen that little in a manner
2366,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,conventional in proportion to its monotony. There are things about which
2367,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"certain historic epochs are strangely silent; so much so, indeed, that"
2368,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the breaking of the silence impresses us almost as the more than human
2369,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"breaking of a spell; and that silence Is the result of a grievous wrong,"
2370,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of a moral disease which half closes the eyes of the fancy, or of a"
2371,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,moral poison which presents to those sorely aching eyes only a glimmer
2372,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,amid darkness. And it is as the most singular instance of such
2373,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"conditions that I should wish to study, in themselves, their causes and"
2374,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"effects, the great differences existing between the ancients and"
2375,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"ourselves on the one hand, and the men of the genuine Middle Ages on the"
2376,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"other, in the degree of interest taken respectively by each in external"
2377,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"nature, the seasons and that rural life which seems to bring us into"
2378,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,closest contact with them both.
2379,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2380,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"There is, of course, a considerable difference between the manner in"
2381,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"which the country, its aspects and occupations, are treated by the poets"
2382,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,of Antiquity and by those of our own day; in the mode of enjoying them
2383,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of an ancient who had read Theocritus and Virgil and Tibullus, and a"
2384,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,modern whose mind is unconsciously full of the influence of Wordsworth
2385,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,or Shelley or Ruskin. But it is a mere difference of mode; and is not
2386,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"greater, I think, than the difference between the descriptions in the"
2387,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""Allegro,"" and the descriptions in ""Men and Women;"" than the difference"
2388,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,between the love of our Elizabethans for the minuter details of the
2389,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"country, the flowers by the stream, the birds in the bushes, the"
2390,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"ferrets, frogs, lizards, and similar small creatures; and the pleasure"
2391,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of our own contemporaries in the larger, more shifting, and perplexing"
2392,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"forms and colours of cloud, sunlight, earth, and rock. The description"
2393,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of effects such as these latter ones, nay, the attention and"
2394,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"appreciation given to them, are things of our own century, even as is"
2395,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the power and desire of painting them. Landscape, in the sense of our"
2396,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"artists of to-day, is a very recent thing; so recent that even in the"
2397,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"works of Turner, who was perhaps the earliest landscape painter in the"
2398,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"modern sense, we are forced to separate from the real rendering of real"
2399,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"effects, a great deal in which the tints of sky and sea are arranged and"
2400,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,distributed as a mere vast conventional piece of decoration. Nor could
2401,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"it be otherwise. For, in poetry as in painting, landscape could become a"
2402,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,separate and substantive art only when the interest in the mere ins and
2403,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"outs of human adventure, in the mere structure and movement of human"
2404,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"limbs, had considerably diminished. There is room, in epic or drama,"
2405,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"only for such little scraps of description as will make clearer, without"
2406,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"checking, the human action; as there is place, in a fresco of a miracle,"
2407,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,or a little picture of carousing and singing bacchantes and Venetian
2408,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"dandies, only for such little bits of laurel grove, or dim plain, or"
2409,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"blue alpine crags, as can be introduced in the gaps between head and"
2410,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"head, or figure and figure."
2411,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2412,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Thus, therefore, a great difference must exist between what would be"
2413,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"felt and written about the country and the seasons by an ancient, by a"
2414,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"man of the sixteenth century, or by a contemporary of our own: a"
2415,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"difference, however, solely of mode; for we feel sure that of the three"
2416,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,men each would find something to delight himself and wherewith to
2417,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"delight others among the elm-bounded English meadows, the fiat"
2418,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"cornfields of central France, the vine and olive yards of Italy--"
2419,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"wherever, in short, he might find himself face to face and, so to"
2420,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"speak, hand in hand with Nature. But about the man of the Middle Ages"
2421,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"(unless, perhaps, in Italy, where the whole Middle Ages were merely an"
2422,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"earlier Renaissance) we could have no such assurance; nay, we might be"
2423,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"persuaded that, however great his genius, be he even a Gottfried von"
2424,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Strassburg, or a Walther von der Vogelweide, or the unknown Frenchman"
2425,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"who has left us ""Aucassin et Nicolette,"" he would bring back impressions"
2426,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"only of two things, authorized and consecrated by the poetic routine of"
2427,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,his contemporaries--of spring and of the woods.
2428,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2429,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,There is nothing more characteristic of mediæval poetry than this
2430,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"limitation. Of autumn, of winter; of the standing corn, the ripening"
2431,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,fruit of summer; of all these things so dear to the ancients and to all
2432,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"men of modern times, the Middle Ages seem to know nothing. The autumn"
2433,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"harvests, the mists and wondrous autumnal transfiguration of the"
2434,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"humblest tree, or bracken, or bush; the white and glittering splendour"
2435,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of winter, and its cosy life by hearth or stove; the drowsiness of"
2436,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"summer, its suddenly inspired wish for shade and dew and water, all this"
2437,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"left them stolid. To move them was required the feeling of spring, the"
2438,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"strongest, most complete and stirring impression which, in our temperate"
2439,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"climates, can be given by Nature. The whole pleasurableness of warm air,"
2440,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"clear moist sky, the surprise of the shimmer of pale green, of the"
2441,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"yellowing blossom on tree tops, the first flicker of faint shadow where"
2442,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"all has been uniform, colourless, shadeless; the replacing of the long"
2443,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"silence by the endless twitter and trill of birds, endless in its way as"
2444,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"is the sea, twitter and trill on every side, depths and depths of it, of"
2445,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"every degree of distance and faintness, a sea of bird song; and along"
2446,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,with this the sense of infinite renovation to all the earth and to man's
2447,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,own heart. Of all Nature's effects this one alone goes sparkling to the
2448,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"head; and it alone finds a response in mediæval poetry. Spring, spring,"
2449,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,endless spring--for three long centuries throughout the world a dreary
2450,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"green monotony of spring all over France, Provence, Italy, Spain,"
2451,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Germany, England; spring, spring, nothing but spring even in the"
2452,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"mysterious countries governed by the Grail King, by the Fairy Morgana,"
2453,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"by Queen Proserpine, by Prester John; nay, in the new Jerusalem, in the"
2454,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"kingdom of Heaven itself, nothing but spring; till one longs for a bare"
2455,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"twig, for a yellow leaf, for a frozen gutter, as for a draught of water"
2456,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,in the desert. The green fields and meadows enamelled with painted
2457,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"flowers, how one detests them! how one would rejoice to see them well"
2458,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sprinkled with frost or burnt up to brown in the dry days! the birds,"
2459,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the birds which warble through every sonnet, canzone, sirventes, glosa,"
2460,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"dance lay, roundelay, virelay, rondel, ballade, and whatsoever else it"
2461,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"may be called,--how one wishes them silent for ever, or their twitter,"
2462,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the tarantarantandei of the eternal German nightingale especially,"
2463,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,drowned by a good howling wind J After any persistent study of mediæval
2464,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"poetry, one's feeling towards spring is just similar to that of the"
2465,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"morbid creature in Schubert's ""Müllerin,"" who would not stir from home"
2466,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"for the dreadful, dreadful greenness, which he would fain bleach with"
2467,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"tears, all around:"
2468,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2469,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2470,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Ich möchte ziehn in die Welt hinaus, hinaus in die weite"
2471,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Welt,"
2472,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Wenn's nur so grün, so grün nicht war da draussen in"
2473,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Wald und Feld.
2474,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2475,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2476,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Moreover this mediæval spring is the spring neither of the shepherd, nor"
2477,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of the farmer, nor of any man to whom spring brings work and anxiety and"
2478,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"hope of gain; it is a mere vague spring of gentle-folk, or at all events"
2479,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of well-to-do burgesses, taking their pleasure on the lawns of castle"
2480,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"parks, or the green holiday places close to the city, much as we see"
2481,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"them in the first part of ""Faust;"" a sweet but monotonous charm of"
2482,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"grass, beneath green lime tree, or in the South the elm or plane; under"
2483,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"which are seated the poet and the fiddler, playing and singing for the"
2484,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"young women, their hair woven with chaplets of fresh flowers, dancing"
2485,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"upon the sward. And poet after poet, Provençal, Italian, and German,"
2486,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Nithart and Ulrich, and even the austere singer of the Holy Grail,"
2487,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Wolfram, pouring out verse after verse of the songs in praise of spring,"
2488,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,which they make even as girls wind their garlands: songs of quaint and
2489,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"graceful ever-changing rythm, now slowly circling, now bounding along,"
2490,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"now stamping out the measure like the feet of the dancers, now winding"
2491,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,and turning as wind and twine their arms in the long-linked mazes; while
2492,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the few and ever-repeated ideas, the old, stale platitudes of praise of"
2493,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"woman, love pains, joys of dancing, pleasure of spring (spring, always"
2494,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"spring, eternal, everlasting spring) seem languidly to follow the life"
2495,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and movement of the mere metre. Poets, these German, Provençal, French,"
2496,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and early Italian lyrists, essentially (if we venture to speak heresy)"
2497,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"not of ideas or emotions, but of metre, of rythm and rhyme; with just"
2498,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the minimum of necessary thought, perpetually presented afresh just as"
2499,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the words, often and often repeated and broken up and new combined, of a"
2500,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"piece of music--poetry which is in truth a sort of music, dance or dirge"
2501,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"or hymn music as the case may be, more than anything else."
2502,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2503,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"As it is in mediæval poetry with the seasons, so it is likewise with the"
2504,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"country and its occupations: as there is only spring, so there is only"
2505,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the forest. Of the forest, mediæval poetry has indeed much to say; more"
2506,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"perhaps, and more familiar with its pleasures, than Antiquity. There is"
2507,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the memorable forest where the heroes of the Nibelungen go to hunt,"
2508,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,followed by their waggons of provisions and wine; where Siegfried
2509,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"overpowers the bear, and returns to his laughing comrades with the huge"
2510,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"thing chained to his saddle; where, in that clear space which we see so"
2511,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"distinctly, a lawn on to which the blue black firs are encroaching,"
2512,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Siegfried stoops to drink of the spring beneath the lime tree, and Hagen"
2513,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,drives his boarspear straight through the Nibelung's back. There is the
2514,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"thick wood, all a golden haze through the young green, and with an"
2515,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"atmosphere of birds' song, where King Mark discovers Tristram and Iseult"
2516,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"in the cave, the deceitful sword between them, as Gottfried von"
2517,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Strassburg relates with wonderful luscious charm. The forest, also, more"
2518,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"bleak and austere, where the four outlawed sons of Aymon live upon roots"
2519,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and wild animals, where they build their castle by the Meuse. Further,"
2520,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and most lovely of all, the forest in which Nicolette makes herself a"
2521,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"hut of branches, bracken, and flowers, through which the stars peep down"
2522,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,on her whiteness as she dreams of her Lord Aucassin. The forest where
2523,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Huon meets Oberon; and Guy de Lusignan, the good snake-lady; and"
2524,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Parzival finds on the snow the feathers and the drops of blood which
2525,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,throw him into his long day-dream; and Owen discovers the tomb of
2526,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Merlin; the forest, in short, which extends its interminable glades and"
2527,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,serried masses of trunks and arches of green from one end to the other
2528,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of mediæval poetry. It is very beautiful, this forest of the Middle"
2529,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Ages; but it is monotonous, melancholy; and has a terrible eeriness in"
2530,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,its endlessness. For there is nothing else. There are no meadows where
2531,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the cows lie lazily, no fields where the red and purple kerchiefs of the"
2532,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"reapers overtop the high corn; no orchards, no hayfields; nothing like"
2533,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"those hill slopes where the wild herbs encroach upon the vines, and the"
2534,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"goats of Corydon and Damoetas require to be kept from mischief; where, a"
2535,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"little lower down, the Athenian shopkeeper of Aristophanes goes daily to"
2536,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"look whether yesterday's hard figs may not have ripened, or the vine"
2537,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,wreaths pruned last week grown too lushly. Nor anything of the sort of
2538,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"those Umbrian meadows, where Virgil himself will stop and watch the"
2539,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"white bullocks splashing slowly into the shallow, sedgy Clitumnus; still"
2540,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,less like those hamlets in the cornfields through which Propertius would
2541,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"stroll, following the jolting osier waggon, or the procession with"
2542,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,garlands and lights to Pales or to the ochre-stained garden god. Nothing
2543,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,of all this: there are no cultivated spots in mediæval poetry; the city
2544,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"only, and the castle, and the endless, all-encompassing forest."
2545,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2546,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"And to this narrowness of mediæval notions of outdoor life, inherited"
2547,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,together with mediæval subjects by the poets even of the sixteenth
2548,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"century, must be referred the curious difference existing between the"
2549,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"romance poets of antiquity, like Homer in the Odyssey, and the romance"
2550,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"poets--Boiardo, Ariosto, Tasso, Spenser, Camoens--of modern times, in"
2551,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the matter of--how shall I express it?--the ideal life, the fortunate"
2552,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"realms, the ""Kennaqwhere."" In Homer, in all the ancients, the ideal"
2553,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,country is merely a more delightful reality; and its inhabitants happier
2554,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,everyday men and women; in the poetry sprung from the Middle Ages it is
2555,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"always a fairy-land constructed by mechanicians and architects. For, as"
2556,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"we have seen, the Middle Ages could bequeath to the sixteenth century no"
2557,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"ideal of peaceful outdoor enjoyment. Hence, in the poetry of the"
2558,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sixteenth century, still permeated by mediæval traditions, an appalling"
2559,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"artificiality of delightfulness. Fallerina, Alcina, Armida, Acrasia, all"
2560,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"imitated from the original Calypso, are not strong and splendid"
2561,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"god-women, living among the fields and orchards, but dainty ladies"
2562,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"hidden in elaborate gardens, all bedizened with fashionable"
2563,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"architecture: regular palaces, pleasaunces, with uncomfortable edifices,"
2564,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"artificial waterfalls, labyrinths, rare and monstrous plants, parrots,"
2565,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"apes, giraffes; childish splendours of gardening and engineering and"
2566,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"menageries, which we meet already in ""Ogier the Dane"" and ""Huon of"
2567,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Bordeaux,"" and which later poets epitomized out of the endless"
2568,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"descriptions of Colonna's ""Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,"" the still more"
2569,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"frightful inventories of the Amadis romances. They are, each of them, a"
2570,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"kind of anticipated Marly, Versailles, Prince Elector's Friedrichsruhe"
2571,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"or Nymphenburg, with clipped cypresses and yews, doubtless, and (O Pales"
2572,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and Pan!) flower-beds filled with coloured plaster and spas, and"
2573,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,cascades spirting out (thanks to fifty invisible pumps) under your feet
2574,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,and over your head. All the vineyards and cornfields have been swept
2575,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,away to make these solemn terraces and water-works; all the cottages
2576,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"which, with their little wooden shrine, their humble enclosure of"
2577,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sunflowers and rosemary and fruit trees, their buzzing hives and barking"
2578,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"dogs, were loved and sung even by town rakes like Catullus and smart"
2579,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,coffeehouse wits like Horace; all these have been swept away to be
2580,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"replaced by the carefully constructed (? wire) bowers, the aviaries, the"
2581,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"porticoes, the frightful circular edifice (_tondo è il ricco edificio_),"
2582,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"a masterpiece of Palladian stucco work, in which Armida and Rinaldo,"
2583,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Acrasia and her Knight, drearily disport themselves. What has become of"
2584,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Calypso's island? of the orchards of Alcinous? What would the noble
2585,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,knights and ladies of Ariosto and Spenser think of them? What would they
2586,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"say, these romantic, dainty creatures, were they to meet Nausicaa with"
2587,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the washed linen piled on her waggon? Alas! they would take her for a
2588,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,laundress. For it is the terrible aristocratic idleness of the Middle
2589,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Ages, their dreary delicacy, which hampers Boiardo, Ariosto, Tasso,"
2590,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Spenser, even in the midst of their most unblushing plagiarisms from"
2591,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Antiquity: their heroes and heroines have been brought up, surrounded by"
2592,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"equerries and duennas, elegant, useless things, or at best (the knights"
2593,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,at least) good only for aristocratic warfare. Plough or prune! defile
2594,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the knightly hands! wash or cook, ply the loom like Nausicaa, Calypso,"
2595,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,or Penelope! The mere thought sends them very nearly into a faint. No:
2596,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the ladies of mediæval romance must sit quiet, idle; at most they may"
2597,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sing to the lute; and if they work with their hands, it must be some"
2598,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"dreary, strictly useless, piece of fancy work; they are hot-house"
2599,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"plants, all these dainty folk."
2600,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2601,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Had they no eyes, then, these poets of the Middle Ages, that they could"
2602,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"see, among all the things of Nature, only those few which had been seen"
2603,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"by their predecessors? At first one feels tempted to think so, till the"
2604,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,recollection of many vivid touches in spring and forest descriptions
2605,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"persuades one that, enormous as was the sway of tradition among these"
2606,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"men, they were not all of them, nor always, repeating mere conventional"
2607,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,platitudes. This singular limitation in the mediæval perceptions of
2608,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Nature--a limitation so important as almost to make it appear as if the
2609,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Middle Ages had not perceived Nature at all--is most frequently
2610,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"attributed to the prevalence of asceticism, which, according to some"
2611,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"critics, made all mediæval men into so many repetitions of Bernard of"
2612,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Clairvaux, of whom it is written that, being asked his opinion of Lake"
2613,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Leman, he answered with surprise that, during his journey from Geneva to"
2614,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the Rhone Valley, he had remarked no lake whatever, so absorbed had he"
2615,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,been in spiritual meditations. But the predominance of asceticism has
2616,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,been grossly exaggerated. It was a state of moral tension which could
2617,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"not exist uninterruptedly, and could exist only in the classes for whom"
2618,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,poetry was not written. The mischief done by asceticism was the warping
2619,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of the moral nature of men, not of their æsthetic feelings; it had no"
2620,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"influence upon the vast numbers, the men and women who relished the"
2621,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,profane and obscene fleshliness and buffoonery of stage plays and
2622,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"fabliaux, and those who favoured the delicate and exquisite immoralities"
2623,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of Courtly poetry. Indeed, the presence of whole classes of writings, of"
2624,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"which such things as Boccaccio's Tales, ""The Wife of Bath,"" and Villon's"
2625,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""Ballades,"" on the one hand, and the songs of the troubadours, the poem"
2626,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of Gottfried, and the romance or rather novel of ""Flamenca,"" are"
2627,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"respectively but the most conspicuous examples, ought to prove only too"
2628,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"clearly that the Middle Ages, for all their asceticism, were both as"
2629,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,gross and as æsthetic in sensualism as antiquity had been before them.
2630,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"We must, therefore, seek elsewhere than in asceticism, necessarily"
2631,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"limited, and excluding the poetry-reading public, for an explanation of"
2632,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"this peculiarity of mediæval poetry. And we shall find it, I think, in"
2633,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"that which during the Middle Ages could, because it was an"
2634,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"all-regulating social condition, really create universal habits of"
2635,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"thought and feeling, namely, feudalism. A moral condition like"
2636,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,asceticism must leave unbiassed all such minds as are incapable of
2637,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,feeling it; but a social institution like feudalism walls in the life of
2638,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"every individual, and forces his intellectual movements into given"
2639,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"paths; nor is there any escape, excepting in places where, as in Italy"
2640,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and in the free towns of the North, the feudal conditions are wholly or"
2641,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"partially unknown. To feudalism, therefore, would I ascribe this, which"
2642,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"appears at first so purely æsthetic, as opposed to social, a"
2643,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"characteristic of the Middle Ages. Ever since Schiller, in his ""Gods of"
2644,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Greece,"" spoke for the first time of undivinized Nature (_die"
2645,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"entgötterte Natur_), it has been the fashion among certain critics to"
2646,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,fall foul of Christianity for having robbed the fields and woods of
2647,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"their gods, and reduced to mere manured clods the things which had been"
2648,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,held sacred by antiquity. Desecrated in those long mediæval centuries
2649,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Nature may truly have been, but not by the holy water of Christian"
2650,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,priests. Desecrated because out of the fields and meadows was driven a
2651,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"divinity greater than Pales or Vertumnus or mighty Pan, the divinity"
2652,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,called _Man_. For in the terrible times when civilization was at its
2653,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"lowest, the things of the world had been newly allotted; and by this new"
2654,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"allotment, man--the man who thinks and loves and hopes and strives, man"
2655,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"who fights and sings--was shut out from the fields and meadows,"
2656,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"forbidden the labour, nay, almost the sight, of the earth; and to the"
2657,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"tending of kine, and sowing of crops, to all those occupations which"
2658,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"antiquity had associated with piety and righteousness, had deemed worthy"
2659,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"of the gods themselves, was assigned, or rather condemned, a creature"
2660,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"whom every advancing year untaught to think or love, or hope, or fight,"
2661,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,or strive; but taught most utterly to suffer and to despair. For a man
2662,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"it is difficult to call him, this mediæval serf, this lump of earth"
2663,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"detached from the field and wrought into a semblance of manhood, merely"
2664,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"that the soil of which it is part should be delved and sown, and then"
2665,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,manured with its carcass or its blood; nor as a man did the Middle Ages
2666,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,conceive it. The serf was not even allowed human progenitors: his foul
2667,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,breed had originated in an obscene miracle; his stupidity and ferocity
2668,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,were as those of the beasts; his cunning was demoniac; he was born under
2669,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"God's curse; no words could paint his wickedness, no persecutions could"
2670,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"exceed his deserts; the whole world turned pale at his crime, for he it"
2671,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"was, he and not any human creature, who had nailed Christ upon the"
2672,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"cross. Like the hunger and sores of a fox or a wolf, his hunger and his"
2673,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sores are forgotten, never noticed. Were it not that legal and"
2674,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,ecclesiastical narratives of trials (not of feudal lords for crushing
2675,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and contaminating their peasants, but of peasants for spitting out and"
2676,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,trampling on the consecrated wafer) give us a large amount of
2677,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"pedantically stated detail; tell us how misery begat vice, and filth and"
2678,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"starvation united families in complicated meshes of incest, taught them"
2679,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,depopulation as a virtue and a necessity; and how the despair of any joy
2680,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"in nature, of any mercy from God, hounded men and women into the"
2681,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"unspeakable orgies, the obscene parodies, of devil worship; were it not"
2682,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,for these horrible shreds of judicial evidence (as of tatters of clothes
2683,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,or blood-clotted hairs on the shoes of a murderer) we should know little
2684,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"or nothing of the life of the men and women who, in mediæval France and"
2685,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Germany, did the work which had been taught by Hesiod and Virgil. About"
2686,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"all these tragedies the literature of the Middle Ages, ready to show us"
2687,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"town vice and town horror, dens of prostitution and creaking,"
2688,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"overweighted gibbets, as in Villon's poems, utters not a word. All that"
2689,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"we can hear is the many-throated yell of mediæval poets, noble and"
2690,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"plebeian, French, Provençal, and German, against the brutishness, the"
2691,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"cunning, the cruelty, the hideousness, the heresy of the serf, whose"
2692,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"name becomes synonymous with every baseness; which, in mock grammatical"
2693,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"style, is declined into every epithet of wickedness; whose punishment is"
2694,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,prayed for from the God whom he outrages by his very existence; a
2695,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"hideous clamour of indecent jibe, of brutal vituperation, of senseless"
2696,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"accusation, of every form of words which furious hatred can assume,"
2697,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"whose echoes reached even countries like Tuscany, where serfdom was well"
2698,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"nigh unknown, and have reached even to us in the scraps of epigram still"
2699,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"bandied about by the townsfolk against the peasants, nay, by the"
2700,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"peasants against themselves.[1] A monstrous rag doll, dressed up in"
2701,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"shreds of many-coloured villainy without a recognizable human feature,"
2702,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"dragged in mud, pilloried with unspeakable ordure, paraded in mock"
2703,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"triumph like a King of Fools, and burnt in the market-place like"
2704,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Antichrist, such is the image which mediæval poetry has left us of the"
2705,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"creature who was once the pious rustic, the innocent god-beloved"
2706,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"husbandman, on whose threshold justice stopped a while when she fled"
2707,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,from the towns of Antiquity.
2708,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2709,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2710,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,[1] The reader may oppose to my views the existence of the--class of
2711,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"poems, French, Latin, and German, of which the Provençal Pastourela is"
2712,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the original type, and which represent the courting, by the poet, who"
2713,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"is, of course, a knight, of a beautiful country-girl, who is shown us as"
2714,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"feeding her sheep or spinning with her distaff. But these poems are, to"
2715,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the best of my knowledge, all of a single pattern, and extremely"
2716,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"insincere and artificial in tone, that I feel inclined to class them"
2717,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,with the pastorals--Dresden china idylls by men who had never looked a
2718,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"live peasant in the face--of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,"
2719,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"--as distant descendants from the pastoral poetry of antiquity, of which"
2720,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the chivalric poets may have got some indirect notions as they did of
2721,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the antique epics. It is moreover extremely the likely that these love
2722,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"poems, in which, successfully or unsuccessfully, the poet usually offers"
2723,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"a bribe to the woman of low degree, conceal beneath the conventional"
2724,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,pastoral trappings the intrigues of minnesingers and troubadours with
2725,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,women of the small artizan or village proprietor class. The real peasant
2726,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,woman--the female of the villain--could scarcely have been above the
2727,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"notice of the noblemen's servants; and, in countries where the"
2728,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"seigneurial rights were in vigour, would scarcely have been offered"
2729,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,presents and fine words. As regards the innumerable poems against the
2730,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"peasantry, I may refer the reader to an extremely curious publication of"
2731,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""Carmina Medii Ævi,"" recently made by Sig. Francesco Novati, and which"
2732,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"contains, besides a selection of specimens, a list of references on the"
2733,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"subject of poems ""De Natura Rusticorum."" One of the satirical"
2734,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,declensions runs as follows:
2735,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2736,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Singulariter.                         Pluraliter.
2737,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Nom.   Hic villanus.                  Nom.   Hi maledicti.
2738,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Gen.   Huius rustici.                 Gen.   Horum tristium.
2739,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Dat.   Huic tferfero (_sic_).           Dat.   His mendacibus.
2740,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Acc.   Hunc furem.                    Acc.   Hos nequissimos.
2741,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Voc.   O latro.                       Voc.   O pessimi.
2742,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Abl.   Ab hoc depredatore.            Abl.   Ab his infidelibus.
2743,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2744,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,The accusation of heresy and of crucifying Christ is evidently
2745,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"due to the devil-worship prevalent among the serfs, and is thus,"
2746,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"alluded to in a north Italian poem, probably borrowed from the"
2747,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,French:
2748,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2749,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Christo fo da villan crucifiò,"
2750,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"E stagom sempre in pioza, in vento, e in neve,"
2751,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Perchè havom fato cosi gran peccà.
2752,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2753,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2754,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,This feeling is exactly analogous to that existing nowadays in
2755,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,semi-barbarous countries against the Jews. The idle hated the
2756,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"industrious, and hated them all the more when their industry brought"
2757,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,them any profit.]
2758,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2759,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2760,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Yet not so; I can recall one, though only one, occasion in which"
2761,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,mediæval literature shows us the serf. The place is surely the most
2762,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"unexpected, the charming thirteenth century tale of ""Aucassin et"
2763,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"Nicolette."" In his beautiful essay upon that story, Mr. Pater has"
2764,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"deliberately omitted this episode, which is indeed like a spot of"
2765,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,blood-stained mud upon some perfect tissue of silver flowers on silver
2766,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"ground. It is a piece of cruellest realism, because quite quiet and"
2767,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"unforced, in the midst of a kind of fairy-land idyl of almost childish"
2768,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"love, the love of the beautiful son of the lord of Beaucaire for a"
2769,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"beautiful Saracen slave girl. For, although Aucassin and Nicolette are"
2770,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"often separated, and always disconsolate--she in her wonderfully"
2771,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"frescoed vaulted room, he in his town prison--there is always"
2772,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"surrounding them a sort of fairy land of trees and flowers, a constant"
2773,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,song of birds; although they wander through the woods and tear their
2774,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"delicate skin, and catch their hair in brambles and briars, we have"
2775,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"always the sense of the daisies bending beneath their tread, of the"
2776,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"green leaves rustling aside from their heads covered with hair--""blond"
2777,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"et menu crespelé."" Their very hardships are lovely, like the hut of"
2778,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"flowering branches and grapes, which Nicolette builds for herself, and"
2779,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,through whose fissures the moonlight shines and the little stars
2780,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"twinkle: so much so, that when they weep, these two beautiful and dainty"
2781,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"creatures, we listen as if to singing, and with no more sense of grief"
2782,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,than at some pathetic little snatch of melody. And in the midst of this
2783,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"idyl of lovely things; in the midst of all these delicate patternings,"
2784,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,whose minuteness and faint tint merge into one vague pleasurable
2785,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"impression; stands out, unintentionally placed there by the author,"
2786,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"little aware of its terrible tragic realism, the episode which I am"
2787,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,going to translate.
2788,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2789,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""Thus Aucassin wandered all day through the forest, without hearing"
2790,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,any news of his sweet love; and when he saw that dusk was
2791,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"spreading, he began bitterly to weep. As he was riding along an old"
2792,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"road, where weeds and grass grew thick and high, he suddenly saw"
2793,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"before him, in the middle of this road, a man such as I am going to"
2794,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"describe to you. He was tall, ugly; nay, hideous quite"
2795,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"marvellously. His face was blacker than smoked meat, and so wide,"
2796,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,that there was a good palm's distance between his eyes; his cheeks
2797,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"were huge, his nostrils also, with a very big flat nose; thick lips"
2798,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"as red as embers, and long teeth yellow and smoke colour. He wore"
2799,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"leathern shoes and gaiters, kept up with string at the knees; on"
2800,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,his back was a parti-coloured coat. He was leaning upon a stout
2801,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"bludgeon. Aucassin was startled and fearful, and said:"
2802,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2803,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'Fair brother (""beau frère""--a greeting corresponding to the"
2804,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"modern ""bon homme"")! God be with thee!'"
2805,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2806,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'God bless you!' answered the man."
2807,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2808,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'What dost thou here?' asked Aucassin."
2809,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2810,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'What is that to you?' answered the man."
2811,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2812,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'I ask thee from no evil motive.'"
2813,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2814,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'Then tell me why,' said the man, 'you yourself are weeping with"
2815,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"such grief? Truly, were I a rich man like you, nothing in the world"
2816,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,should make me weep.'
2817,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2818,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'And how dost thou know me?'"
2819,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2820,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'I know you to be Aucassin, the son of the Count; and if you will"
2821,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"tell me why you weep, I will tell you why I am here.'"
2822,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2823,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'I will tell thee willingly,' answered Aucassin. 'This morning I"
2824,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"came to hunt in the forest; I had a white leveret, the fairest in"
2825,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the world; I have lost him--that is why I am weeping.'
2826,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2827,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'What!' cried the man;' it is for a stinking hound that you waste"
2828,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the tears of your body? Woe to those who shall pity you; you, the"
2829,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,richest man of this country. If your father wanted fifteen or
2830,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"twenty white leverets, he could get them. I am weeping and mourning"
2831,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,for more serious matters.'
2832,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2833,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'And what are these?'"
2834,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,
2835,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"""'I will tell you. I was hired to a rich farmer to drive his"
2836,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"plough, dragged by four bullocks. Three days ago, I lost a red"
2837,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"bullock, the best of the four. I left the plough, and sought the"
2838,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"red bullock on all sides, but could not find him. For three days I"
2839,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"have neither eaten nor drunk, and have been wandering thus. I have"
2840,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"been afraid of going to the town, where they would put me in jail,"
2841,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,because I have not wherewith to pay for the bullock. All I possess
2842,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,are the clothes on my back. I have a mother; and the poor woman had
2843,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,nothing more valuable than me; since she had only an old smock
2844,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,wherewith to cover her poor old limbs. They have torn the smock off
2845,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"her back, and now she has to lie on the straw. It is about her that"
2846,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"I am afflicted more than about myself, because, as to me, I may get"
2847,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"some money some day or other, and as to the red bullock, he may be"
2848,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,paid for when he may. And I should never weep for such a trifle as
2849,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"that. Ah! woe betide those who shall make sorrow with you!'"""
2850,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,

2852,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,Inserted merely to give occasion to show Aucassin's good heart in paying
2853,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the twenty _sols_ for the man's red bullock; perhaps for no reason at
2854,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"all, but certainly with no idea of making the lover's misery seem by"
2855,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"comparison trifling--there are, nevertheless, few things in literature"
2856,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"more striking than the meeting in the wood of the daintily nurtured boy,"
2857,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,weeping over the girl whom he loves with almost childish love of the
2858,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"fancy; and of that ragged, tattered, hideous serf, at whose very aspect"
2859,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,the Bel Aucassin stops in awe and terror. And the attitude is grand of
2860,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"this unfortunate creature, who neither begs nor threatens, scarcely"
2861,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"complains, and not at all for himself; but merely tells his sordid"
2862,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"misfortune with calm resignation, as if used to such everyday miseries,"
2863,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,roused to indignation only at the sight of the tears which the fine-bred
2864,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,youth is shedding. We feel the dreadful solemnity of the man's words; of
2865,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"the reproach thus thrown by the long-suffering serf, accustomed to"
2866,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"misfortunes as the lean ox is to blows, to that delicate thing weeping"
2867,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"for his lady love, for the lady of his fancy. It is the one occasion"
2868,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"upon which that delicate and fantastic mediæval love poetry, that"
2869,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"fanciful, wistful stripling King Love of the Middle Ages, in which he"
2870,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"keeps high court, and through which he rides in triumphal procession;"
2871,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,that King Love laughing and fainting by turns with all his dapper
2872,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"artificiality of woes; is confronted with the sordid reality, the tragic"
2873,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"impersonation of all the dumb miseries, the lives and loves, crushed and"
2874,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"defiled unnoticed, of the peasantry of those days. Yes, while they"
2875,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"sing--Provençals, minnesingers, Sicilians, sing of their earthly lady"
2876,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"and of their paramour in heaven--the hideous peasant, whose naked granny"
2877,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"is starving on the straw, looks on with dull and tearless eyes; crying"
2878,THE OUTDOOR POETRY.,"out to posterity, as the serf cries to Aucassin: ""Woe to those who shall"

2884,II.,
2885,II.,"But meanwhile, during those centuries which lie between the dark ages"
2886,II.,"and modern times, the Middle Ages (inasmuch as they mean not a mere"
2887,II.,"chronological period, but a definite social and mental condition)"
2888,II.,"fortunately did not exist everywhere. Had they existed, it is almost"
2889,II.,impossible to understand how they would ever throughout Europe have come
2890,II.,"to an end; for as the favourite proverb of Catharine of Siena has it,"
2891,II.,"one dead man cannot bury another dead man; and the Middle Ages, after"
2892,II.,"this tedious dying of the fifteenth century, required to be shovelled"
2893,II.,"into the tomb, nay, rather, given the final stroke, by the Renaissance."
2894,II.,This that we foolishly call--giving a quite incorrect notion of sudden
2895,II.,"and miraculous birth--the Renaissance, and limit to the time of the"
2896,II.,"revival of Greek humanities, really existed, as I have repeatedly"
2897,II.,"suggested wherever, during the mediæval centuries, the civilization of"
2898,II.,"which the twelfth and thirteenth centuries were big was not, by the"
2899,II.,"pressure of feudalism and monasticism, made to be abortive or stillborn."
2900,II.,"Low as was Italy at the very close of the dark ages, and much as she"
2901,II.,"borrowed for a long while from the more precocious northern nations,"
2902,II.,"especially France and Provence; Italy had, nevertheless, an enormous"
2903,II.,advantage in the fact that her populations were not divided into victor
2904,II.,"and vanquished, and that the old Latin institutions of town and country"
2905,II.,"were never replaced, except in certain northern and southern districts,"
2906,II.,by feudal arrangements. The very first thing which strikes us in the
2907,II.,"obscure Italian commonwealths of early times, is that in these"
2908,II.,resuscitated relics of Roman or Etruscan towns there is no feeling of
2909,II.,"feudal superiority and inferiority; that there is no lord, and"
2910,II.,consequently no serf. Nor is this the case merely within the city walls.
2911,II.,The never sufficiently appreciated difference between the Italian free
2912,II.,"burghs and those of Germany, Flanders, and Provence, is that the"
2913,II.,citizens depend only in the remotest and most purely fictitious way upon
2914,II.,"any kind of suzerain; and moreover that the country, instead of"
2915,II.,"belonging to feudal nobles, belong every day more and more completely to"
2916,II.,"the burghers. The peasant is not a serf, but one of three things--a"
2917,II.,"hired labourer, a possessor of property, or a farmer, liable to no"
2918,II.,"taxes, paying no rent, and only sharing with the proprietor the produce"
2919,II.,"of the land. By this latter system, existing, then as now, throughout"
2920,II.,"Tuscany, the peasantry was an independent and well-to-do class. The land"
2921,II.,"owned by one man (who, in the commonwealths, was usually a shopkeeper or"
2922,II.,manufacturer in the town) was divided into farms small enough to be
2923,II.,"cultivated--vines, olives, corn, and fruit--by one family of peasants,"
2924,II.,helped perhaps by a paid labourer. The thriftier and less scrupulous
2925,II.,"peasants could, in good seasons, put by sufficient profit from their"
2926,II.,"share of the produce to suffice after some years, and with the addition"
2927,II.,"of what the women might make by washing, spinning, weaving, plaiting"
2928,II.,straw hats (an accomplishment greatly insisted upon by Lorenzo dei
2929,II.,"Medici), and so forth, to purchase some small strip of land of their"
2930,II.,"own. Hence, a class of farmers at once living on another man's land and"
2931,II.,"sharing its produce with him, and cultivating and paying taxes upon land"
2932,II.,belonging to themselves.
2933,II.,
2934,II.,Of these Tuscan peasants we get occasional glimpses in the mediæval
2935,II.,"Italian novelists--a well-to-do set of people, in constant communication"
2936,II.,"with the town where they sell their corn, oil, vegetables, and wine, and"
2937,II.,easily getting confused with the lower class of artizans with whom they
2938,II.,doubtless largely intermarried. These peasants whom we see in tidy
2939,II.,"kilted tunics and leathern gaiters, driving their barrel-laden bullock"
2940,II.,"carts, or riding their mules up to the red city gates in many a"
2941,II.,Florentine and Sienese painting of the fourteenth and fifteenth
2942,II.,"centuries, were in many respects better off than the small artizans of"
2943,II.,"the city, heaped up in squalid houses, and oppressed by the greater and"
2944,II.,"smaller guilds. Agnolo Pandolfini, teaching thrift to his sons in"
2945,II.,"Alberti's charming treatise on ""The Government of the Family,"""
2946,II.,"frequently groans over the insolence, the astuteness of the peasantry;"
2947,II.,and indeed seems to consider that it is impossible to cope with them--a
2948,II.,conclusion which would have greatly astounded the bailiffs of the feudal
2949,II.,proprietors in the Two Sicilies and beyond the Alps. Indeed it is
2950,II.,impossible to conceive a stranger contrast than that between the
2951,II.,"northern peasant, the starved and stunted serf, whom Holbein drew,"
2952,II.,"driving his lean horses across the hard furrow, with compassionate Death"
2953,II.,"helping along the plough, and the Tuscan farmer, as shown us by Lorenzo"
2954,II.,"dei Medici--the young fellow who, while not above minding his cows or"
2955,II.,"hoeing up his field, goes into Florence once a week, offers his"
2956,II.,"sweetheart presents of coral necklaces, silk staylaces, and paint for"
2957,II.,"her cheeks and eyelashes; who promises, to please her, to have his hair"
2958,II.,frizzled (as only the youths of the Renaissance knew how to be frizzled
2959,II.,"and fuzzed) by the barber, and even dimly hints that some day he may"
2960,II.,"appear in silken jerkin and tight hose, like a well-to-do burgess. No"
2961,II.,"greater contrast perhaps, unless indeed we should compare his"
2962,II.,"sweetheart, Lorenzo's beautiful Nenciozza, with her box full of jewels,"
2963,II.,"her Sunday garb of damask kirtle and gold-worked bodice, her almost"
2964,II.,"queenly ways towards her adorers, with the wretched creature, not a"
2965,II.,"woman, but a mere female animal, cowering among her starving children in"
2966,II.,"her mud cottage, and looking forward, in dull lethargy, after the"
2967,II.,"morning full of outrages at the castle, to the night, the night on the"
2968,II.,"heath, lit with mysterious flickers, to the horrible joys of the"
2969,II.,"sacrifice which the oppressed brings to the dethroned, the serf to"
2970,II.,"Satan; when, in short, we compare the peasant woman described by Lorenzo"
2971,II.,"with the female serf resuscitated by the genius of Michelet; nay, more"
2972,II.,"poignant still, with that mother in the ""Dance of Death,"" seated on the"
2973,II.,"mud flood of the broken-roofed, dismantled hovel, stewing something on a"
2974,II.,"fire of twigs, and stretching out vain arms to her poor tattered"
2975,II.,"baby-boy, whom, with the good-humoured tripping step of an old nurse,"
2976,II.,the kindly skeleton is leading away out of this cruel world.
2977,II.,
2978,II.,Such were the conditions of the peasantry of the great Italian
2979,II.,"commonwealths. They were, as much as the northern serfs were the"
2980,II.,"reverse, creatures pleasant to deal with, pleasant to watch."
2981,II.,
2982,II.,"The upper classes, on the other hand, differed quite as much from the"
2983,II.,"upper classes of feudal countries. They were, be it remembered, men of"
2984,II.,"business, constantly in contact with the working classes; Albizis,"
2985,II.,"Strozzis, Pandolfinis, Guinigis, Tolomeis, no matter what their name,"
2986,II.,these men who built palaces and churches which outdid the magnificence
2987,II.,"of northern princes, and who might, at any moment, be sent ambassadors"
2988,II.,"from Florence, Lucca, or Siena, to the French or English kings, to the"
2989,II.,"Emperor or the Pope, spent a large portion of their days at their office"
2990,II.,"desk, among the bales of their warehouses, behind the counter of their"
2991,II.,"shops; they wore the same dress, had the same habits, spoke the same"
2992,II.,"dialect, as the weavers and dyers, the carriers and porters whom they"
2993,II.,"employed, and whose sons might, by talent and industry, amass a fortune,"
2994,II.,"build palaces, and go ambassadors to kings in their turn. When,"
2995,II.,"therefore, these merchant nobles turned to the country for rest and"
2996,II.,"relief from their cares, it was not to the country as it existed for the"
2997,II.,feudal noble of the North. Boar and stag hunts had no attraction for
2998,II.,quiet men of business; forests stocked with wild beasts where vineyard
2999,II.,"and cornfield might have extended, would have seemed to them the very"
3000,II.,"height of wastefulness, discomfort, and ugliness. Pacific and"
3001,II.,"businesslike, they merely transferred to the country the habits of"
3002,II.,thought and of life which had arisen in the city. Not for them any
3003,II.,"imitation of the feudal castle, turreted and moated, cut up into dark"
3004,II.,"irregular rooms and yards, filled with noisy retainers and stinking"
3005,II.,"hounds. On some gentle hillside a well-planned palace, its rooms"
3006,II.,"spacious and lofty, and sparely windowed for coolness in summer; with a"
3007,II.,"neat cloistered court in the centre, ventilating the whole house, and"
3008,II.,"affording a cool place, full of scent of flowers and sound of fountains"
3009,II.,"for the burning afternoons; a belvedere tower also, on which to seek a"
3010,II.,"breeze on stifling nights, when the very stars seem faint for heat, and"
3011,II.,the dim plumy heads of cypress and poplar are motionless against the
3012,II.,"misty blue sky. In front a broad terrace, whence to look down towards"
3013,II.,"the beloved city, a vague fog of roofs in the distance; on the side and"
3014,II.,"behind, elaborate garden walks walled with high walls of box and oak and"
3015,II.,"laurel, in which stand statues in green niches; gardens with little"
3016,II.,"channels to bring water, even during droughts, to the myrtles, the"
3017,II.,"roses, the stocks and clove pinks, over which bend with blossoms"
3018,II.,"brilliant against the pale blue sky the rose-flowered oleander, the"
3019,II.,scarlet-flowered pomegranate; also aviaries and cages full of odd and
3020,II.,"harmless creatures, ferrets, guinea pigs, porcupines, squirrels, and"
3021,II.,"monkeys; arbours where wife, daughters, and daughters-in-law may sew and"
3022,II.,"make music; and neat lawns where the young men may play at quoits,"
3023,II.,"football, or swordsticks and bucklers; and then, sweeping all round the"
3024,II.,house and gardens and terraces an undulating expanse of field and
3025,II.,"orchard, smoke-tinted with olive, bright green in spring with budding"
3026,II.,"crops, russet in autumn with sere vines; and from which, in the burning"
3027,II.,"noon, rises the incessant sawing noise of the cicalas, and ever and anon"
3028,II.,"the high, nasal, melancholy chant of the peasant, lying in the shade of"
3029,II.,barn door or fig tree till the sun shall sink and he can return to his
3030,II.,"labour. If the house in town, with its spacious store-rooms, its carved"
3031,II.,"chapel, and painted banqueting hall, large enough to hold sons' children"
3032,II.,"and brothers' wives and grandchildren, and a whole host of poor"
3033,II.,"relatives, whom the wise father (as Pandolfini teaches) employs rather"
3034,II.,than strangers for his clerks and overseers--if this town house was the
3035,II.,"pride of the Italian burgess; the villa, with its farms and orchards,"
3036,II.,"was the real joy, the holiday paradise of the over-worked man. To read"
3037,II.,"in the cool house, with cicala's buzz and fountain plash all round, the"
3038,II.,Greek and Latin authors; to discuss them with learned men; to watch the
3039,II.,"games of the youths and the children, this was the reward for years of"
3040,II.,labour and intelligence; but sweeter than all this (how we feel it in
3041,II.,Agnolo Pandolfini's speeches!) were those occupations which the city
3042,II.,"could not give: the buying and selling of plants, grain, and kine, the"
3043,II.,"meddling with new grafted trees, the mending of spaliers, the"
3044,II.,"straightening of fences, the going round (with the self-importance and"
3045,II.,"impatience of a cockney) to see what flowers had opened, what fruit had"
3046,II.,"ripened over-night; to walk through the oliveyards, among the vines; to"
3047,II.,"pry into stable, pig-stye, and roosting-place, taking up handfuls of"
3048,II.,"drying grain, breaking twigs of olives, to see how things were doing;"
3049,II.,"and to have long conversations with the peasants, shrewd enough to"
3050,II.,affect earnest attention when the master was pleased to vent his
3051,II.,"town-acquired knowledge of agriculture and gardening. Sweet also,"
3052,II.,"doubtless, for younger folk, or such perhaps as were fonder of teaching"
3053,II.,"new lute tunes to the girls than of examining into cabbages, and who"
3054,II.,read Dante and Boccaccio more frequently than Cicero or Sallust; though
3055,II.,"sweet perhaps only as a vague concomitant of their lazy pleasures, to"
3056,II.,"listen to those songs of the peasantry rising from the fields below,"
3057,II.,"while lying perhaps on one's back in the shaded grass, watching the"
3058,II.,"pigeons whirring about the belvedere tower. Vaguely pleasant this also,"
3059,II.,"doubtless; but for a long while only vaguely. For, during more than two"
3060,II.,"centuries, the burgesses of Italy were held enthralled by the Courtly"
3061,II.,"poets of other countries; listening to, and reading, at first, only"
3062,II.,"Provençals and Sicilians, or Italians, like Sordello, pretending to be"
3063,II.,"of Provence or Sicily; and even later, enduring in their own poets,"
3064,II.,"their own Guittones, Cavalcantis, Cinos, Guinicellis, nay even in Dante"
3065,II.,"and Petrarch's lyrics, only the repetition (however vivified by genius)"
3066,II.,"of the old common-places of Courtly love, and artificial spring, of the"
3067,II.,poetry of feudal nations. But the time came when not only Provençal and
3068,II.,"Sicilian, but even Tuscan, poetry was neglected, when the revival of"
3069,II.,Greek and Latin letters made it impossible to rewrite the threadbare
3070,II.,"mediæval prettinesses, or even to write in earnest in the modern tongue,"
3071,II.,"so stiff and thin (as it seemed) and like some grotesque painted saint,"
3072,II.,"when compared with the splendidly fleshed antique languages, turning and"
3073,II.,"twining in graceful or solemn involutions, as of a Pyrrhic or a maidens'"
3074,II.,"dance. And it was during this period, from Petrarch to Politian, that,"
3075,II.,"as philologists have now proved beyond dispute, the once fashionable"
3076,II.,"chivalric romance, and the poetry of Provençal and Sicilian school, cast"
3077,II.,"off by the upper classes, was gradually picked up by the lower and"
3078,II.,especially by the rural classes. Vagabond ballad-singers and
3079,II.,"story-tellers--creatures who wander from house to house, mending broken"
3080,II.,"pottery, collecting rags or selling small pedlar's wares--were the old"
3081,II.,clothesmen who carried about these bits of tarnished poetic finery. The
3082,II.,"people of the town, constantly in presence of the upper classes, and"
3083,II.,"therefore sooner or later aware of what was or was not in fashion, did"
3084,II.,not care long for the sentimental daintiness of mediæval poetry;
3085,II.,"besides, satire and scurrility are as inevitable in a town as are dogs"
3086,II.,in gutters and cats on roofs; and the townsfolk soon set their own
3087,II.,buffoonish or satirical ideas to whatever remained of the music of
3088,II.,mediæval poetry: already early in the fifteenth century the sonnet had
3089,II.,become for the Florentine artizans a mere scurrilous epigram. It was
3090,II.,"different in the country. The peasant, at least the Tuscan peasant, is"
3091,II.,eminently idealistic and romantic in his literary tastes; it may be that
3092,II.,he has not the intellectual life required for any utterances or forms of
3093,II.,"his own, and that he consequently accepts poetry as a ready-made"
3094,II.,"ornament, something pretty and exotic, which is valued in proportion to"
3095,II.,"its prettiness and rarity. Be the reason whatever it may, certain it is"
3096,II.,that nothing can be too artificial or high-flown to please the Italian
3097,II.,"peasantry: its tales are all of kings; princesses, fairies, knights,"
3098,II.,"winged horses, marvellous jewels, and so forth; its songs are almost"
3099,II.,"without exception about love, constancy, moon, stars, flowers. Such"
3100,II.,things have not been degraded by familiarity and parody as in the town;
3101,II.,"they retain for the country folk the vague charm (like that of music,"
3102,II.,automatic and independent of thorough comprehension) of belonging to a
3103,II.,sphere of the marvellous; hence they are repeated and repeated with
3104,II.,"almost religious servility, as any one may observe who will listen to"
3105,II.,the stories and verses told and sung even nowadays in the Tuscan
3106,II.,"country, or who will glance over the splendid collections of folklore"
3107,II.,"made in the last twenty years. Such things, must suffer alteration from"
3108,II.,"people who can neither read nor write, and who cannot be expected to"
3109,II.,"remember very clearly details which, in many cases, must have for them"
3110,II.,only the vaguest meaning. The stories split in process of telling and
3111,II.,"re-telling, and are completed with bits of other stories; details are"
3112,II.,forgotten and have to be replaced; the same happens with poetry: songs
3113,II.,"easily get jumbled together, their meaning is partially obliterated, and"
3114,II.,"has to be restored or, again, an attempt is made by bold men to adapt"
3115,II.,some seemingly adaptable old song to a new occasion an old love ditty
3116,II.,"seems fit to sing to a new sweetheart.--names, circumstances, and"
3117,II.,details require arranging for this purpose; and hence more alterations.
3118,II.,"Now, however much a peasant may enjoy the confused splendours of Court"
3119,II.,"life and of Courtly love, he cannot, with the best will in the world,"
3120,II.,restore their details or colouring if they happen to become obliterated.
3121,II.,If he chance to forget that when the princess first met the wizard she
3122,II.,"was riding forth on a snow-white jennet with a falcon on her glove,"
3123,II.,there is nothing to prevent his describing her as walking through the
3124,II.,"meadow in charge of a flock of geese; and similarly, should he happen to"
3125,II.,forget that the Courtly lover compares the skin of his mistress to ivory
3126,II.,"and her eyes to Cupid's torches, he is quite capable of filling up the"
3127,II.,gap by saying that the girl is as white as a turnip and as bright-eyed
3128,II.,"as a ferret. As with details of description and metaphors, so also with"
3129,II.,the emotional and social parts of the business. The peasant has not been
3130,II.,brought up in the idea that the way to gain a woman's affection is to
3131,II.,stick her glove on a helmet and perform deeds of prowess closely
3132,II.,resembling those of Don Quixote in the Sierra Morena; so he attempts to
3133,II.,"ingratiate himself by offering her presents of strawberries, figs,"
3134,II.,"buttons, hooks-and-eyes, and similar desirable things. Again, were the"
3135,II.,"peasant to pay attentions to a married woman, he would merely get (what"
3136,II.,"noble husbands were too well bred to dream of) a sound horsewhipping, or"
3137,II.,perhaps even a sharp knife thrust in his stomach; so that he takes good
3138,II.,care to address his love songs only to marriageable young women. In this
3139,II.,"way, without any deliberate attempt .at originality, the old Courtly"
3140,II.,"poetry becomes, when once removed to the country, thoroughly patched and"
3141,II.,"seamed with rustic ideas, feelings, and images; while never ceasing to"
3142,II.,"be, in its general stuff and shape, of a kind such as only professional"
3143,II.,poets of the upper classes can produce. The Sicilian lyrics collected by
3144,II.,"Signor Pitre, still more the Tuscan poems of Tigri's charming volume,"
3145,II.,"are, therefore, a curious mixture of high-flown sentiment, dainty"
3146,II.,"imagery, and most artistic arrangements of metre and diction (especially"
3147,II.,"in the rispetto, where metrical involution is accompanied by logical"
3148,II.,"involution of the most refined mediæval sort), with hopes and complaints"
3149,II.,"such as only a farmer could frame, with similes and descriptions such as"
3150,II.,"only the business of the field, vineyard, and dairy could suggest. A"
3151,II.,"mixture, but not a jumble. For as in this slow process of assimilation"
3152,II.,and alteration only that was remembered by the peasant which the peasant
3153,II.,could understand and sympathize with; and only that was welded into the
3154,II.,once Courtly poetry which was sufficiently refined to please the people
3155,II.,"who delighted in the exotic refinement--as, in short, everything came"
3156,II.,"about perfectly simply and unconsciously, there resulted what in good"
3157,II.,sooth may be considered as a perfectly substantive and independent form
3158,II.,"of art, with beauties and refinements of its own. And, indeed, it"
3159,II.,"appears to me that one might say, without too much paradox, that in"
3160,II.,these peasant songs only does the poetry of minnesingers and
3161,II.,"troubadours, become thoroughly enjoyable; that only when the"
3162,II.,"conventionality of feeling and imagery is corrected by the freshness,"
3163,II.,"the straightforwardness, nay, even the grotesqueness of rural likings,"
3164,II.,"dislikings, and comparisons, can the dainty beauty of mediæval Courtly"
3165,II.,poetry ever really satisfy our wishes. Comparing together Tigri's
3166,II.,collection of Tuscan folk poetry with any similar anthology that might
3167,II.,"be made of middle-high German and Provençal, and early Italian lyrics, I"
3168,II.,feel that the adoption of Courtly mediæval poetry by the Italian
3169,II.,peasantry of the Renaissance can be compared more significantly than at
3170,II.,first seemed with the adoption of a once fashionable garb by country
3171,II.,"folk. The peasant pulled about this Courtly lyrism, oppressively tight"
3172,II.,in its conventional fit and starched with elaborate rhetorical
3173,II.,"embroideries; turned it inside out, twisted a bit here, a bit there,"
3174,II.,"ripped open seam after seam, patched and repatched with stuffs and"
3175,II.,stitches of its own; and then wore the whole thing as it had never been
3176,II.,"intended to be worn; until this cast-off poetic apparel, stretched on"
3177,II.,"the freer moral limbs of natural folk, faded and stained by weather and"
3178,II.,"earth into new and richer tints, had lost all its original fashionable"
3179,II.,"stiffness, and crudeness of colour, and niminy-piminy fit, and had"
3180,II.,"acquired instead I know not what grace of unexpectedness,"
3181,II.,"picturesqueness, and ease.[1]"
3182,II.,
3183,II.,
3184,II.,[1] Any one who is sceptical of the Courtly derivation of the Italian
3185,II.,"popular song may, besides consulting the admirable book of Prof."
3186,II.,"d'Ancona, compare with the contents of Tigri's famous ""Canti popolari"
3187,II.,"Toscani,"" the following scraps of Sicilian and early Italian lyrics:--"
3188,II.,
3189,II.,"The Emperor Frederick II. writes: ""Rosa di maggio--Colorita e"
3190,II.,fresca--Occhi hai fini--E non rifini--Di gioie dare--Lo tuo parlare--La
3191,II.,"gente innamora--Castella ed altura."""
3192,II.,
3193,II.,"Jacopo Pugliesi says of his lady: ""Chiarita in viso più che"
3194,II.,argento--Donami allegrezze--Ben eo son morto--E mal colto--Se non mi dai
3195,II.,"conforto--_Fior dell' orto_."""
3196,II.,

3198,II.,"angelo incarnando--Gioia aggio preso di giglio novello--E vago, che"
3199,II.,sormonta ogni ricchezza--Sua dottrina m' affrezza--Cosi mi coglie e
3200,II.,"olezza--Come pantera le bestie selvagge."""
3201,II.,

3205,II.,"le doni vita ed allegranza--E sì la cresca in gran pregio ed onore."""
3206,II.,
3207,II.,I must finish off what might be a much longer collection with a charming
3208,II.,"little scrap, quite in rispetto tone, by Guinicelli: ""Vedut 'ho la"
3209,II.,lucente stella diana--Ch' appare anzi che 'l giorno renda albore--Ch' a
3210,II.,preso forma di figura umana--Sovr' ogni altra mi par che dia
3211,II.,"splendore--Viso di neve colorato in grana--Occhi lucenti, gai e pien"
3212,II.,d'amore--Non credo che nel mondo sia cristiana--Si piena di beltate e di
3213,II.,"valore.""]"
3214,II.,
3215,II.,
3216,II.,Well; for many a year did the song of the peasants rise up from the
3217,II.,fields and oliveyards unnoticed by the good townsfolk taking their
3218,II.,"holiday at the Tuscan villa; but one day, somewhere in the third quarter"
3219,II.,"of the fifteenth century, the long-drawn chant of the rispetto, telling"
3220,II.,"perhaps how the singer's sweetheart was beautiful as the star Diana, so"
3221,II.,beautiful as a baby that the Pope christened her with his own hands; the
3222,II.,quavering nasal cadence of the stornello saying by chance--
3223,II.,
3224,II.,
3225,II.,"Flower of the Palm, &c.,"
3226,II.,
3227,II.,
3228,II.,"did at last waken the attention of one lettered man, a man of curious"
3229,II.,"and somewhat misshapen body and mind, of features satyr-like in"
3230,II.,"ugliness, yet moody and mystical in their very earthiness; a man"
3231,II.,"essentially of the senses, yet imperfect in them, without taste or"
3232,II.,"smell, and, over and above, with a marvellously supple intellect; weak"
3233,II.,"and coarse and idealistic; and at once feebly the slave of his times,"
3234,II.,"and so boldly, spontaneously innovating as to be quite unconscious of"
3235,II.,"innovation: the mixed nature, or rather the nature in many heterogeneous"
3236,II.,"bits, of the man of letters who is artistic almost to the point of being"
3237,II.,"an actor, natural in every style because morally connected with no style"
3238,II.,"at all. The man was Lorenzo di Piero dei Medici, for whom posterity has"
3239,II.,exclusively reserved the civic title of all his family and similar town
3240,II.,"despots, calling him the Magnificent. It is the fashion at present to"
3241,II.,"give Lorenzo only the leavings, as it were, of our admiration for the"
3242,II.,"weaker, less original, nay, considerably enervate, humanistic exquisite"
3243,II.,Politian; and this absurd injustice appears to me to show that the very
3244,II.,essence and excellence of Lorenzo is not nowadays perceived. The
3245,II.,"Renaissance produced several versatile and charming poets; and, in the"
3246,II.,"midst of classic imitation, one or two, of whom one is certainly"
3247,II.,"Boiardo, of real freshness and raciness. But of this new element in the"
3248,II.,"Renaissance, this element which is neither imitation of antiquity nor"
3249,II.,"revival of mediæval, which is original, vital, fruitful, in short,"
3250,II.,"modern, Lorenzo is the most versatile example. He is new, Renaissance,"
3251,II.,"modern; not merely in this or that quality, he is so all round. And this"
3252,II.,in the first place because he is so completely the man of impressions;
3253,II.,"the man not uttering wonderful things, nor elaborating exquisite ones,"
3254,II.,but artistically embodying with marvellous versatility whatever strikes
3255,II.,his fancy and feeling--fancy and feeling which are as new as the
3256,II.,untouched sculptor's clay. And this extraordinary temper of art for
3257,II.,"art's sake, or rather effect for effect and form's sake, was possible in"
3258,II.,"that day only in a man equally without strong passions, and without"
3259,II.,strong convictions. He is naturally attracted most by what is most
3260,II.,"opposed to the academic, Virgilian, Horatian, or Petrarchesque"
3261,II.,"æstheticism of his contemporaries; he is essentially a realist, and all"
3262,II.,"the effects, which he produces, all the beauty, charm, or beastliness of"
3263,II.,"his work, corresponds to beauty, charm, or beastliness in the reality of"
3264,II.,things. If Lorenzo writes at one moment carnival songs of ribald
3265,II.,"dirtiness, at the next hymns full of holy solemnity; it is, I think,"
3266,II.,merely because this versatile artist takes pleasure in trying whether
3267,II.,"his face may not be painted into grinning drunkenness, and then"
3268,II.,"elongated and whitened into ascetic gentleness. Instead of seeking, like"
3269,II.,"most of his contemporaries, to be Greek, Roman, or mediæval by turns, he"
3270,II.,preferred trying on all the various tricks of thought and feeling which
3271,II.,he remarked among his unlettered townsfolk. His realism naturally drew
3272,II.,him towards the classes where realism can deal with the real; and not
3273,II.,"the affected, the self-conscious, the deliberately attempted. Hence"
3274,II.,"those wonderful little poems, the carnival songs of the gold-thread"
3275,II.,"spinners, of the pastry-cooks, of the shoemakers, which give us so"
3276,II.,"completely, so gracefully, the whole appearance, work, manner, gesture"
3277,II.,"of the people; give them to us with ease and rapidity so perfect, that"
3278,II.,we scarcely know how they are given; that we almost forget verses and
3279,II.,"song, and actually see the pulling, twisting, and cutting of the"
3280,II.,gold-threads; that we see and hear the shoemaker's hands smoothing down
3281,II.,"the leather of the shoe in his hand, to convince his customers of its"
3282,II.,pliability; that we see and smell the dear little pale yellow pasties
3283,II.,"nestling in the neat white baskets, after having stood by and watched"
3284,II.,"the dough being kneaded, chopped, and floured over, the iron plates"
3285,II.,"heated in the oven, the soft, half-baked paste twisted and bent; nay, we"
3286,II.,"feel almost as if we had eaten of them, those excellent things which"
3287,II.,seem such big mouthfuls but are squeezed and crunched at one go like
3288,II.,"nothing at all. Hence, I mean from this love of watching effects and"
3289,II.,"reproducing them, originated also the masterpiece of Lorenzo dei Medici,"
3290,II.,"the ""Nencia da Barberino."""
3291,II.,
3292,II.,"This poem, of some fifty octaves, is the result of those Tuscan peasant"
3293,II.,"songs, of which I have told you the curious Courtly descent, at last"
3294,II.,"having struck the fancy of a real poet. It is, what Lorenzo's"
3295,II.,"masterpiece necessarily must be, in the highest degree a modern"
3296,II.,"performance; as modern as a picture by Bastien Lepage; as an opera,"
3297,II.,"founded upon local music, by Bizet. For it is not by any manner of means"
3298,II.,"a pastoral, a piece of conventional poetic decoration, with just a"
3299,II.,"little realistic detail, more of the mere conventional or more of the"
3300,II.,"realistic dominating according as it is a pastoral by Theocritus, or a"
3301,II.,pastoral by Quinault or Metastasio. It is the very reverse of this: it
3302,II.,"is the attempt to obtain a large and complete, detailed and balanced"
3303,II.,impression by the cunning arrangement of a number of small effects which
3304,II.,the artist has watched in reality; it is the making into a kind of
3305,II.,"little idyl, something half narrative, half drama, with distinct figures"
3306,II.,"and accessories and background, of a whole lot of little fragments"
3307,II.,"imitated from the peasant poetry, and set in thin, delicate rims of"
3308,II.,"imitation no longer of the peasant's songs, but of the peasant's"
3309,II.,"thoughts and speech; a perfect piece of impressionist art, marred only"
3310,II.,in rare places by an attempt (inevitable in those days) to force the
3311,II.,"drawing and colour into caricature. The construction, which appears to"
3312,II.,"be nowhere, is in reality a masterpiece; for, without knowing it, you"
3313,II.,"are shown the actors, the background, the ups and downs of temper, the"
3314,II.,variation of the seasons; above all you are shown the heroine through
3315,II.,"the medium of the praises, the complaints, the narratives of the past,"
3316,II.,"the imaginings of the future, of the hero, whose incoherent rhapsodizing"
3317,II.,"constitutes the whole poem. He, Valléra, is a well-to-do young farmer;"
3318,II.,"she, Nencia, is the daughter of peasant folk of the castellated village"
3319,II.,"of Barberino in the Mugello; he is madly in love, but shy, and (to all"
3320,II.,"appearance) awkward, so that we feel convinced that of all these"
3321,II.,"speeches in praise of his Nenciozza, in blame of his indifference,"
3322,II.,highly poetic flights and most practical adjurations to see all the
3323,II.,"advantages of a good match, the young woman hears few or none; Valléra"
3324,II.,"is talking not to her, but at her, or rather, he is rehearsing to"
3325,II.,himself all the things which he cannot squeeze out in her presence. It
3326,II.,"is the long day-dream, poetic, prosaic, practical, and imaginative, of a"
3327,II.,"love-sick Italian peasant lad, to whom his sweetheart is at once an"
3328,II.,"ideal thing of beauty, a goddess at whose shrine songs must be sung and"
3329,II.,"wreaths twined; and a very substantial lass, who cannot be indifferent"
3330,II.,"to sixpenny presents, and whom he cannot conceive as not ultimately"
3331,II.,"becoming the sharer of his cottage, the cooker of his soup, the mender"
3332,II.,"of his linen, the mother of his brats--a dream in which image is effaced"
3333,II.,"by image, and one thought is expelled, unfinished, by another. She is to"
3334,II.,"him like the Fairy Morgana, the fairy who kept so much of chivalry in"
3335,II.,her enchanted island; she is like the evening star when above his
3336,II.,cottage it slowly pierces the soft blue sky with its white brilliancy;
3337,II.,"she is purer than the water in the well, and sweeter than the malmsey"
3338,II.,"wine, and whiter than the miller's flour; but her heart is as hard as a"
3339,II.,"pebble, and she loves driving to distraction a whole lot of youths who"
3340,II.,"dangle behind her, captives of those heart-thievish eyes of hers. But"
3341,II.,"she is also a most excellent housewife, can stand any amount of hard"
3342,II.,"field labour, and makes lots of money by weaving beautiful woollen"
3343,II.,"stuff. To see her going, to church of a morning, she is a little pearl!"
3344,II.,"her bodice is of damask, and her petticoat of bright, colour, and she"
3345,II.,"kneels down carefully where she may be seen, being so smart. And then,"
3346,II.,"when she dances!--a born dancer, bouncing like a little goat, and"
3347,II.,twirling more than a mill-wheel; and when she has finished she makes you
3348,II.,such a curtsey; no citizen's wife in Florence can curtsey as she does.
3349,II.,It was in April that he first fell in love. She was picking salad in the
3350,II.,"garden; he begged her for a little, and she sent him about his business;"
3351,II.,"las, alas! ever since then his peace has been gone; he cannot sleep, he"
3352,II.,"can only think of her, and follow her about; he has become quite"
3353,II.,"good-for-nothing as to his field work,--yet he hears all the people"
3354,II.,"around laughing and saying, ""Of course Valléra will get her."" Only _she_"
3355,II.,"will pay no heed to him. She is finer to look at than the Pope, whiter"
3356,II.,than the whitest wood core: she is more delectable than are the young
3357,II.,"figs to the earwigs, more beautiful than the turnip flower, sweeter than"
3358,II.,honey. He is more in love with her than the moth is in love with the
3359,II.,lamp; she loves to see him perishing for her. If he could cut himself in
3360,II.,"two without too much pain, he would, just to let her see that he carries"
3361,II.,"her in his heart. No; he would cut out his heart, and when she has"
3362,II.,"touched it with that slender hand of hers, it would cry out, ""Nencia,"
3363,II.,"Nencia bella."" But, after all, he is not to be despised: he is an"
3364,II.,"excellent labourer, most learned in buying--and selling pigs, he can"
3365,II.,"play the bagpipe beautifully; he is rich, is willing to go to any"
3366,II.,"expense to please her, nay, even to pay the barber double that his hair"
3367,II.,may be nice and fuzzy from the crimping irons; and if only he were to
3368,II.,"get himself tight hose and a silk jerkin, he would be as good as any"
3369,II.,"Florentine burgess. But she will not listen; or, rather, she listens and"
3370,II.,"laughs. Yes, she sits up in bed at night and laughs herself to death at"
3371,II.,"the mere thought of him, that is all he gets. But he knows what it is!"
3372,II.,There is a fellow who will keep sneaking about her; if Valléra only
3373,II.,"catch him near his cottage, won't he give him a taste of his long new"
3374,II.,"knife! nay, rip him up and throw his bowels, like those of a pig, to dry"
3375,II.,"on a roof! He is sorry--perhaps he bores her--God bless you, Nencia!--he"
3376,II.,had better go and look after his sheep.
3377,II.,
3378,II.,All this is not the poetry of the Renaissance peasant; it is the poem
3379,II.,made out of his reality; the songs which Valléra sang in the fields
3380,II.,about his Nencia we must seek in the volume of Tigri; those rispetti and
3381,II.,stornelli of to-day are the rispetti and stornelli of four centuries
3382,II.,ago; they are much more beautiful and poetic than any of Lorenzo's work;
3383,II.,but Lorenzo has given us not merely a peasant's love-song; he has given
3384,II.,"us a peasant's thoughts, actions, hopes, fears; he has given us the"
3385,II.,"peasant himself, his house, his fields, and his sweetheart, as they"
3386,II.,"exist even now. For Lorenzo is gone, and, greater than he, the paladins"
3387,II.,"and ladies of Boiardo and Ariosto, have followed the saints and virgins"
3388,II.,of Dante into the limbo of fair unrealities; and the very Greek and
3389,II.,"Roman heroes of a hundred years ago, the very knights and covenanters of"
3390,II.,"forty years since, have joined them; but Valléra exists still, and still in"
3391,II.,"the flesh exists his Nenciozza. Everything changes, except the country"
3392,II.,"and the peasant. For, in the long farms of Southern Tuscany, with double"
3393,II.,row of blackened balcony all tapestried with heavy ingots of Indian
3394,II.,"corn, and spread out among the olives of the hillside, up which twists"
3395,II.,the rough bullock road protected by its vine trellis; and in the little
3396,II.,"farms, with queer hood-shaped double roofs (as if to pull over the face"
3397,II.,"of the house when it blows hard), and pigeon towers which show that some"
3398,II.,"day they must have been fortified, all about Florence; farms which I"
3399,II.,"pass every day, with their sere trees all round, their rough gardens of"
3400,II.,bright dahlias and chrysanthemums draggled by the autumn rains--in these
3401,II.,"there are, do not doubt it, still Nencias: magnificent creatures, fit"
3402,II.,"models for Amazons, only just a trifle too full-blown and matronly; but"
3403,II.,"with real Amazonian limbs, firm and delicate, under their red and purple"
3404,II.,striped print frocks; creatures with heads set on necks like towers or
3405,II.,"columns, necks firm in broad, well-fleshed chest as branches in a tree's"
3406,II.,trunk; great penthouses of reddish yellow or lustreless black crimped
3407,II.,"hair over the forehead; the forehead, like the cheeks, furrowed a good"
3408,II.,"deal--perhaps we dainty people might say, faded and wrinkled by work in"
3409,II.,the burning sun and the wind; women whom you see shovelling bread into
3410,II.,"the heated ovens, or plashing in winter with bare arms in half-frozen"
3411,II.,"streams, or digging up a turnip field in the drizzle; or on a Sunday,"
3412,II.,"standing listless by their door, surrounded by rolling and squalling"
3413,II.,"brats, and who, when they slowly look up at the passer-by, show us, on"
3414,II.,"those monumental faces of theirs, a strange smile, a light of bright"
3415,II.,eyes and white teeth; a smile which to us sophisticated townspeople is
3416,II.,"as puzzling as certain sudden looks in some comely animal, but which yet"
3417,II.,makes us understand instinctively that we have before us a Nencia; and
3418,II.,"that the husband yonder, though he now swears at his wife, and perhaps"
3419,II.,"occasionally beats her, has nevertheless, in his day, dreamed, argued,"
3420,II.,"raged, and sung to himself just like Lorenzo's Valléra."
3421,II.,
3422,II.,"The ""Nencia da Barberino"" is certainly Lorenzo dei Medici's masterpiece:"
3423,II.,it is completely and satisfactorily worked out. Yet we may strain
3424,II.,"possibilities to the point of supposing (which, however, I cannot for a"
3425,II.,"moment suppose) that this ""Nencia"" is a kind of fluke; that by an"
3426,II.,accident a beautiful and seemingly appreciative poem has resulted where
3427,II.,"the author, a mediæval realist of a superior Villon sort, had intended"
3428,II.,"only a piece of utter grotesqueness. But important as is the ""Nencia,"""
3429,II.,"Lorenzo has left behind him another poem, greatly inferior in"
3430,II.,"completeness, but which settles beyond power of doubt that in him the"
3431,II.,"Renaissance was not merely no longer mediæval, but most intensely"
3432,II.,"modern. This poem is the ""Ambra."" It is simply an allegorical narrative"
3433,II.,"of the inundation, by the river Ombrone, of a portion, called Ambra, of"
3434,II.,the great Medicean villa of Poggio a Caiano. Lorenzo's object was
3435,II.,"evidently to write a semi-Ovidian poem, of a kind common in his day, and"
3436,II.,"common almost up to our own: a river-god, bearded, crown of reeds, urn,"
3437,II.,"general dampness and uproariousness of temper, all quite correct; and a"
3438,II.,"nymph, whom he pursues, who prays to the Virgin huntress to save her"
3439,II.,"from his love, and who, just in the nick of time, is metamorphosed into"
3440,II.,"a mossy stone, dimly showing her former woman's shape; the style of"
3441,II.,"thing, charming, graceful, insipid, of which every one can remember a"
3442,II.,"dozen instances, and which immediately brings up to the mind a vision of"
3443,II.,"grand-ducal gardens, where, among the clipped ilexes and the cypress"
3444,II.,"trunks, great lumbering water-gods and long-limbed nymphs splash,"
3445,II.,"petrified and covered with melancholy ooze and yellow lichen, among the"
3446,II.,"stagnant grotto waters. In some respects, therefore, there is in the"
3447,II.,"""Ambra"" somewhat more artificial, more _barrocco_ than that early"
3448,II.,Renaissance of Politian and Pontano would warrant. There also several
3449,II.,"bits, half graceful, half awkward, pedantic, constrained, childish,"
3450,II.,"delightful, like the sedge-crowned rivers telling each other anecdotes"
3451,II.,"of the ways and customs of their respective countries, and especially"
3452,II.,"the charming dance of zephyr with the flowers on the lawns of Cyprus,"
3453,II.,which must immediately suggest pictures by Piero di Cosimo and by
3454,II.,"Botticelli. So far, therefore, there is plenty to enjoy, but nothing to"
3455,II.,"astonish, in the ""Ambra."" But the Magnificent Lorenzo has had the"
3456,II.,"extraordinary whim of beginning his allegory with a description,"
3457,II.,"twenty-one stanzas long, of the season of floods. A description, full of"
3458,II.,infinitely delicate minute detail: of the plants which have kept their
3459,II.,"foliage while the others are bare--the prickly juniper, the myrtle and"
3460,II.,"bay; of the flocks of cranes printing the sky with their queer shapes,"
3461,II.,"of the fish under the ice, and the eagle circling slowly round the"
3462,II.,ponds--little things which affect us mixed up as they are with all
3463,II.,"manner of stiff classic allusions, very much as do the carefully painted"
3464,II.,daisies and clover among the embossed and gilded unrealities of certain
3465,II.,"old pictures. From these rather finikin details, Lorenzo passes,"
3466,II.,"however, to details which are a good deal more than details, things"
3467,II.,little noticed until almost recently: the varying effect of the olives
3468,II.,"on the hillside--a grey, green mass, a silver ripple, according as the"
3469,II.,"wind stirs them; the golden appearance of the serene summer air, and so"
3470,II.,"forth; details no longer, in short, but essentially, however minute,"
3471,II.,"effects. And then, suddenly leaving such things behind, he rushes into"
3472,II.,"the midst of a real picture, a picture which you might call almost"
3473,II.,"impressionistic, of the growth of rivers and the floods. The floods are"
3474,II.,"a grand sight; more than a sight--a grand performance, a drama;"
3475,II.,"sometimes, God knows, a tragedy. Last night, under a warm, hazy sky,"
3476,II.,"through whose buff-tinted clouds the big moon crept in and out, the"
3477,II.,mountain stream was vaguely visible--a dark riband in its wide shingly
3478,II.,"bed, when the moon was hidden; a narrow, shallow, broken stream, sheets"
3479,II.,"of brilliant metallic sheen, and showers of sparkling facets, when the"
3480,II.,moon was out; a mere drowsy murmur mixing with the creaking and rustling
3481,II.,"of dry reeds in the warm, wet wind. Thus in the evening. Look down from"
3482,II.,"your window next morning. A tremendous rushing mass of waters, thick,"
3483,II.,"turbid, reddish, with ominous steel-like lustre where its coppery"
3484,II.,"surface reflects the moist blue sky, now fills the whole bed, shaking"
3485,II.,"its short fringe of foam, tossing the spray as it swirls round each"
3486,II.,"still projecting stone, angrily tugging at the reeds and alders which"
3487,II.,"flop their draggled green upon its surface; eddying faster and faster,"
3488,II.,"encircling each higher rock or sandbank, covering it at last with its"
3489,II.,"foaming red mass. Meanwhile, the sky is covered in with vaporous grey"
3490,II.,"clouds, which enshroud the hills; the clear runnels, dash over the green"
3491,II.,"banks, spirt through the walls, break their way across the roads; the"
3492,II.,"little mountain torrents, dry all summer, descend, raging rivers, red"
3493,II.,with the hill soil; and with every gust of warm wind the river rises
3494,II.,higher and rushes along tremendously impetuous. Down in the plain it
3495,II.,"eats angrily at the soft banks, and breaks its muddy waters, fringed on"
3496,II.,"the surface with a sort of ominous grime of broken wood and earth,"
3497,II.,higher and higher against the pierheads of the bridges; shaking them to
3498,II.,"split their masonry, while crowds of men and women look on, staring at"
3499,II.,"the rising water, at the planks, tables, beams, cottage thatches, nay,"
3500,II.,"whole trees, which it hurls at the bridge piers. And then, perhaps, the"
3501,II.,"terrible, soft, balmy flood-wind persisting, there comes suddenly the"
3502,II.,"catastrophe; the embankment, shaken by the resistless current, cracks,"
3503,II.,"fissures gives way; and the river rushes into the city, as it has"
3504,II.,"already rushed into the fields, to spread in constantly rising,"
3505,II.,"melancholy livid pools, throughout the streets and squares."
3506,II.,
3507,II.,"This Lorenzo saw, and, wonderful to say, in this soiled and seething"
3508,II.,"river, in these torn and crumbling banks, in all the dreadfulness of"
3509,II.,"these things, he saw a beauty and a grandeur. But he saw not merely the"
3510,II.,struggle of the waters and of the land; he--the heartless man who laid
3511,II.,his hand even upon the saved-up money of orphan girls in order to keep
3512,II.,up the splendour of his house and of his bank--saw the misfortunes of
3513,II.,"the peasantry; the mill, the cottage by the riverside, invaded by the"
3514,II.,"flood; the doors burst open by the tremendous rushing stream, the"
3515,II.,stables and garners filled with the thick and oozy waters; the poor
3516,II.,"creatures, yesterday prosperous, clinging to the roof, watching their"
3517,II.,"sheep and cows, their hay, and straw, and flour, the hemp bleached in"
3518,II.,"the summer, the linen spun and woven in the long winter, their furniture"
3519,II.,"and chattels, their labour and their hope whirled along by the foaming"
3520,II.,river.
3521,II.,
3522,II.,"Thus by this versatile Lorenzo dei Medici, this flippant, egotistic"
3523,II.,"artist and despot, has at last been broken the long spell of the Middle"
3524,II.,"Ages. The Renaissance has sung no longer of knights and of spring, but"
3525,II.,"of peasants and of autumn. An immoral and humanistic time, an immoral"
3526,II.,"and humanistic man, have had at length a heart for the simpler, ruder"
3527,II.,"less favoured classes of mankind; an eye for the bolder, grander, more"
3528,II.,"solemn sights of Nature: modern times have begun, modern sympathies,"
3529,II.,modern art are in full swing.

3558,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"them to the ground; while the crowd of beggars, ragged, maimed,"
3559,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"paralyzed, leprous, grovelling on their withered limbs, see and implore"
3560,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Death, and cry stretching forth their arms, their stumps, and their"
3561,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"crutches. Further on, three kings in long embroidered robes and"
3562,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"gold-trimmed shovel caps, Lewis the Emperor, Uguccione of Pisa, and"
3563,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Castruccio of Lucca, with their retinue of ladies and squires, and"
3564,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hounds and hawks, are riding quietly through a wood. Suddenly their"
3565,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"horses stop, draw back; the Emperor's bay stretches out his long neck"
3566,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sniffing the air; the kings strain forward to see, one holding his nose"
3567,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,for the stench of death which meets him; and before them are three open
3568,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"coffins, in which lie, in three loathsome stages of corruption, from blue"
3569,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and bloated putrescence to well-nigh fleshless decay, three crowned"
3570,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,corpses. This is the triumph of Death; the grim and horrible jest of the
3571,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Middle Ages: equality in decay; kings, emperors, ladies, knights,"
3572,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"beggars, and cripples, this is what we all come to be, stinking corpses;"
3573,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Death, our lord, our only just and lasting sovereign, reigns impartially"
3574,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,over all.
3575,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3576,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"But opposite, all along the sides of the painted cloister, the Amazons"
3577,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,are wrestling with the youths on the stone of the sarcophagi; the
3578,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"chariots are dashing forward, the Tritons are splashing in the marble"
3579,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,waves; the Bacchantæ are striking their timbrels in their dance with the
3580,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"satyrs; the birds are pecking at the grapes, the goats are nibbling at"
3581,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the vines; all is life, strong and splendid in its marble eternity. And"
3582,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the mutilated Venus smiles towards the broken Hermes; the stalwart
3583,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Hercules, resting against his club, looks on quietly, a smile beneath"
3584,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"his beard; and the gods murmur to each other, as they stand in the"
3585,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"cloister filled with earth from Calvary, where hundreds of men lie"
3586,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"rotting beneath the cypresses, ""Death will not triumph for ever; our day"
3587,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"will come."""
3588,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3589,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"We have all seen them opposite to each other, these two arts, the art"
3590,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,born of Antiquity and the art born of the Middle Ages; but whether this
3591,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"meeting was friendly or hostile or merely indifferent, is a question of"
3592,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"constant dispute. To some, mediæval art has appeared being led,"
3593,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Dante-like, by a magician Virgil through the mysteries of nature up to a"
3594,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Christian Beatrice, who alone can guide it to the kingdom of heaven;"
3595,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"others have seen mediæval art, like some strong, chaste Sir Guyon"
3596,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"turning away resolutely from the treacherous sorceress of Antiquity, and"
3597,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,pursuing solitarily the road to the true and the good; for some the
3598,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"antique has been an impure goddess Venus, seducing and corrupting the"
3599,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Christian artist; the antique has been for others a glorious Helen, an"
3600,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"unattainable perfection, ever pursued by the mediæval craftsman, but"
3601,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"seized by him only as a phantom. Magician or witch, voluptuous,"
3602,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"destroying Venus or cold and ungrasped Helen, what was the antique to"
3603,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the art born of the Middle Ages and developed during the Renaissance?
3604,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Was the relation between them that of tuition, cool and abstract; or of"
3605,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,fruitful love; or of deluding and damning example?
3606,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3607,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,The art which came to maturity in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth
3608,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"centuries was generated in the early mediæval revival. The seeds may,"
3609,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"indeed, have come down from Antiquity, but they remained for nearly a"
3610,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"thousand years hidden in the withered, rotting remains of former"
3611,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,vegetation; and it was not till that vegetation had completely
3612,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"decomposed and become part of the soil, it was not till putrefaction had"
3613,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"turned into germination, that artistic organism timidly reappeared. The"
3614,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,new art-germ developed with the new civilization which surrounded it.
3615,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Manufacture and commerce reappeared: the artizans and merchants formed
3616,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"into communities; the communities grew into towns, the towns into"
3617,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,cities; in the city arose the cathedral; the Lombard or Byzantine
3618,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,mouldings and traceries of the cathedral gave birth to figure-sculpture;
3619,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,its mosaics gave birth to painting; every forward movement of the
3620,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"civilization unfolded as it were a new form or detail of the art, until,"
3621,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"when mediæval civilization was reaching its moment of consolidation,"
3622,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"when the cathedrals of Lucca and Pisa stood completed, when Niccolò and"
3623,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Giovanni Pisano had sculptured their pulpits and sepulchres; painting,"
3624,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"in the hands of Cimabue and Duccio, of Giotto and of Guido da Siena,"
3625,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,freed itself from the tradition of the mosaicists as sculpture had freed
3626,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"itself from the practice of the stone-masons, and stood forth an"
3627,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,independent and organic art.
3628,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3629,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Thus painting was born of a new civilization, and grew by its own vital"
3630,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"force; a thing of the Middle Ages, original and spontaneous. But"
3631,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,contemporaneous with the mediæval revival was the resuscitation of
3632,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Antiquity; in proportion as the new civilization developed, the old"
3633,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,civilization was exhumed; real Latin began to be studied only when real
3634,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Italian began to be written; Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio were at once"
3635,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the founders of modern literature and the exponents of the literature of
3636,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,antiquity; the strong young present was to profit by the experience of
3637,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the past.
3638,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3639,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"As it was with literature, so likewise was it with art. The most purely"
3640,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mediæval sculpture, the sculpture which has, as it were, just detached"
3641,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"itself from the capitals and porches of the cathedral, is the direct"
3642,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pupil of the antique; and the three great Gothic sculptors, Niccolò,"
3643,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Giovanni, and Andrea of Pisa, learn from fragments of Greek and Roman"
3644,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,sculpture how to model the figure of the Redeemer and how to chisel the
3645,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"robe of the Virgin. This spontaneous mediæval sculpture, aided by the"
3646,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"antique, preceded by a full half-century the appearance of mediæval"
3647,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,painting; and it was from the study of the works of the Pisan sculptors
3648,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,that Cimabue and Giotto learned to depart from the mummified
3649,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"monstrosities of the hieratic, Byzantine and Roman style of Giunta and"
3650,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Berlinghieri. Thus, through the sculpture of the Pisans the painting of"
3651,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the school of Giotto received at second-hand the teachings of Antiquity.
3652,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Sculpture had created painting; painting now belonged to the painters.
3653,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,In the hands of Giotto it developed within a few years into an art which
3654,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"seemed almost mature, an art dealing victoriously with its materials,"
3655,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"triumphantly solving its problems, executing as if by miracle all that"
3656,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,was demanded of it. But Giottesque art appeared perfect merely because
3657,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"it was limited; it did all that was required of it, because that which"
3658,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,was required was little; it was not asked to reproduce the real nor to
3659,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"represent the beautiful; it was asked merely to suggest a character, a"
3660,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"situation, a story."
3661,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3662,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,The artistic development of a nation has its exact parallel in the
3663,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,artistic development of an individual. The child uses his pencil to tell
3664,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"a story, satisfied with balls and sticks as body, head, and legs;"
3665,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,provided he and his friends can associate with them the ideas in their
3666,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"minds. The youth sets himself to copy what he sees, to reproduce forms"
3667,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and effects, without any aim beyond the mere pleasure of copying. The"
3668,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mature artist strives to obtain forms and effects of which he approves,"
3669,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,he seeks for beauty. In the life of Italian painting the generation of
3670,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,men who flourished at the beginning of the sixteenth century are the
3671,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,mature artists; the men of the fifteenth century are the inexperienced
3672,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,youths; the Giottesques are the children--children Titanic and
3673,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"seraph-like, but children nevertheless; and, like all children, learning"
3674,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,more perhaps in their few years than can the youth and the man learn in
3675,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,a lifetime.
3676,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3677,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Like the child, the Giottesque painter wished to show a situation or"
3678,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"express a story, and for this purpose the absolute realization of"
3679,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"objects was unnecessary. Giottesque art is not incorrect art, it is"
3680,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,generalized art; it is an art of mere outline. The Giottesques could
3681,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"draw with great accuracy the hand: the form of the fingers, the bend of"
3682,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the limb, they could give to perfection its whole gesture and movement,"
3683,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"they could produce a correct and spirited outline, but within this"
3684,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"correct outline marked off in dark paint there is but a vague, uniform"
3685,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mass of pale colour; the body of the hand is missing, and there remains"
3686,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"only its ghost, visible indeed, but unsubstantial, without weight or"
3687,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"warmth, eluding the grasp. The difference between this spectre hand of"
3688,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the Giottesques, and the sinewy, muscular hand which can shake and crush"
3689,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,of Masaccio and Signorelli; or the soft hand with throbbing pulse and
3690,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"warm pressure of Perugino and Bellini,--this difference is typical of"
3691,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the difference between the art of the fourteenth century and the art of
3692,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the fifteenth century: the first suggests, the second realizes; the one"
3693,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"gives impalpable outlines, the other gives tangible bodies. The"
3694,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Giottesque cares for the figure only inasmuch as it displays an action;
3695,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"he reduces it to a semblance, a phantom, to the mere exponent of an"
3696,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,idea; the man of the Renaissance cares for the figure inasmuch as it is
3697,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"a living organism, he gives it substance and weight, he makes it stand"
3698,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"out as an animate reality. Thence, despite its early triumphs, the"
3699,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Giottesque style, by its inherent nature, forbade any progress; it"
3700,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"reached its limits at once, and the followers of Giotto look almost as"
3701,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"if they were his predecessors, for the simple reason that, being unable"
3702,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"to advance, they were forced to retrograde. The limited amount of"
3703,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,artistic realization required to present to the mind of the spectator a
3704,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"situation or an allegory, had been obtained by Giotto himself, and"
3705,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"bequeathed by him to his followers; who, finding it more than sufficient"
3706,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"for their purposes, and having no incentive to further acquisition in"
3707,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the love of form and reality for their own sake, worked on with their"
3708,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"master's materials, composing and recomposing, but adding nothing of"
3709,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"their own. Giotto had observed Nature with passionate interest, because,"
3710,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"although its representation was only a means to an end, it was a means"
3711,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,which required to be mastered; and as such became in itself a sort of
3712,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,secondary aim; but the followers of Giotto merely utilized his
3713,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"observations--of Nature, and in so doing gradually conventionalized and"
3714,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,debased these second-hand observations. Giotto's forms are wilfully
3715,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"incomplete, because they aim at mere suggestion, but they are not"
3716,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"conventional: they are diagrams, not symbols, and thence it is that"
3717,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Giotto seems nearer to the Renaissance than do his latest followers, not"
3718,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"excepting even Orcagna. Painting, which had made the most prodigious"
3719,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"strides from Giunta to Cimabue, and from Cimabue to Giotto, had got"
3720,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"enclosed within a vicious circle, in which it moved for nearly a century"
3721,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,neither backwards nor forwards: painters were satisfied with suggestion;
3722,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and as long as they were satisfied, no progress was possible."
3723,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3724,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"From this Giottesque treadmill, painting was released by the"
3725,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,intervention of another art. The painters were hopelessly mediocre;
3726,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"their art was snatched from them by the sculptors. Orcagna himself,"
3727,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"perhaps the only Giottesque who gave painting an onward push, had"
3728,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,modelled and cast one of the bronze gates of the Florence baptistery;
3729,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the generation of artists who arose at the beginning of the fifteenth
3730,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"century, and who opened the period of the Renaissance, were sculptors or"
3731,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pupils of sculptors. When we see these vigorous lovers of nature, these"
3732,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"heroic searchers after truth, suddenly pushing aside the decrepit"
3733,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Giottesque allegory-mongers, we ask ourselves in astonishment whence"
3734,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"they have arisen, and how those broken-down artists of effete art could"
3735,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,have begotten such a generation of giants. Whence do they come?
3736,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Certainly not from the studios of the Giottesques. No, they issue out of"
3737,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the workshops of the stone-mason, of the goldsmith, of the worker in"
3738,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"bronze, of the sculptor. Vasari has preserved the tradition that"
3739,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Masolino and Paolo Uccello were apprentices of Ghiberti; he has remarked
3740,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"that their greatest contemporary, Masaccio, ""trod in the steps of"
3741,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Brunelleschi and of Donatello."" Pollaiolo and Verrocchio we know to have"
3742,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"been equally excellent as painters and as workers in bronze. Sculpture,"
3743,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,at once more naturalistic and more constantly under the influence of the
3744,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"antique, had for the second time laboured for painting. Itself a"
3745,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"subordinate art, without much vitality, without deep roots in the"
3746,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"civilization, sculpture was destined to remain the unsuccessful pupil of"
3747,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the antique, and the unsuccessful rival of painting; but sculpture had"
3748,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,for its mission to prepare the road for painting and to prepare painting
3749,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,for antique influence; and the noblest work of Ghiberti and Donatello
3750,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"was Masaccio, as the most lasting glory to the Pisani had been Giotto."
3751,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3752,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"With Masaccio began the study of nature for its own sake, the desire of"
3753,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"reproducing external objects, without any regard to their significance"
3754,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"as symbols, or as parts of a story; the passionate wish to arrive at"
3755,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,absolute realization. The merely suggestive outline art of the
3756,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Giottesques had come to an end; the suggestion became a matter of
3757,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"indifference, the realization became a paramount interest; the story was"
3758,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"forgotten in the telling, the religious thought was lost in the search"
3759,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,for the artistic form. The Giottesques had used debased conventionalism
3760,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,to represent action with wonderful narrative and logical power; the
3761,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,artists of the early Renaissance became unskilful narrators and foolish
3762,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,allegorists almost in proportion as they became skilful draughtsmen and
3763,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,colourists; the saints had become to Masaccio merely so many lay figures
3764,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,on to which to cast drapery; for Fra Filippo the Madonna was a mere
3765,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"peasant model; for Filippino Lippi and for Ghirlandajo, a miracle meant"
3766,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,merely an opportunity of congregating a number of admirable portrait
3767,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,figures in the dress of the day; the Baptism for Verrocchio had
3768,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,significance only as a study of muscular legs and arms; and the
3769,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,sacrifice of Noah had no importance for Uccello save as a grand
3770,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"opportunity for foreshortenings. In the hands of the Giottesques,"
3771,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"interested in the subject and indifferent to the representation,"
3772,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,painting had remained stationary for eighty years; for eighty years did
3773,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"it develope in the hands of the men of the fifteenth century,"
3774,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,indifferent to the subject and passionately interested in the
3775,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"representation. The unity, the appearance of comparative perfection of"
3776,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the art had disappeared with the limits within which the Giottesques had
3777,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,been satisfied to move; instead of the intelligible and solemn
3778,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"conventionalism of the Giottesques, we see only disorder,"
3779,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"half-understood ideas and abortive attempts, confusion which reminds us"
3780,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,of those enigmatic sheets on which Leonardo or Michael Angelo scrawled
3781,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"out their ideas--drawings within drawings, plans of buildings scratched"
3782,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"over Madonna heads, single flowers upside down next to flayed arms,"
3783,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"calculations, monsters, sonnets; a very chaos of thoughts and of shapes,"
3784,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"in which the plan of the artist is inextricably lost, which mean"
3785,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"everything and nothing, but out of whose unintelligible network of lines"
3786,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and curves have issued masterpieces, and which only the foolish or the"
3787,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"would-be philosophical would exchange for some intelligible, hopelessly"
3788,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,finished and finite illustration out of a Bible or a book of travels.
3789,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3790,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Anatomy, perspective, colour, drapery, effects of light, of water, of"
3791,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"shadow, forms of trees and flowers, converging lines of architecture,"
3792,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,all this at once absorbed and distracted the attention of the artists of
3793,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the early Renaissance; and while they studied, copied, and calculated,"
3794,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"another thought began to haunt them, another eager desire began to"
3795,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pursue them: by the side of Nature, the manifold, the baffling, the"
3796,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"bewildering, there rose up before them another divinity, another sphinx,"
3797,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,mysterious in its very simplicity and serenity--the Antique.
3798,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3799,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"The exhumation of the antique had, as we have seen, been contemporaneous"
3800,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"with the birth of painting; nay, the study of the remains of antique"
3801,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sculpture had, in contributing to form Niccolò Pisano, indirectly helped"
3802,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,to form Giotto; the very painter of the Triumph of Death had inserted
3803,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"into his terrible fresco two-winged genii, upholding a scroll, copied"
3804,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"without any alteration from some coarse Roman sarcophagus, in which they"
3805,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"may have sustained the usual _Dis Manibus Sacrum_. There had been, on"
3806,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the part of both sculptors and painters, a constant study of the"
3807,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,antique; but during the Giottesque period this study had been limited to
3808,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"technicalities, and had in no way affected the conception of art. The"
3809,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mediæval artists, surrounded by physical deformities, and seeing"
3810,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sanctity in sickness and dirt, little accustomed to observe the human"
3811,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"figure, were incapable, both as men and as artists, of at all entering"
3812,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,into the spirit of antique art. They could not perceive the superior
3813,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,beauty of the antique; they could recognize only its superior science
3814,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and its superior handicraft, and these alone they studied to obtain."
3815,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3816,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Giovanni Pisano sculpturing the unfleshed, caried carcases of the devils"
3817,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"who leer, writhe, crunch, and tear on the outside of Orvieto Cathedral;"
3818,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and the Giottesques painting those terrible green, macerated Christs,"
3819,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hanging livid and broken from the cross, which abound in Tuscany and"
3820,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Umbria; the artists who produced these loathsome and lugubrious works
3821,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,were indubitably students of the antique; but they had learned from it
3822,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"not a love for beautiful form and noble drapery, but merely the general"
3823,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,shape of the limbs and the general fall of the garments: the anatomical
3824,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,science and technical processes of Antiquity were being used to produce
3825,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the most intensely un-antique, the most intensely mediæval works. Thus"
3826,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"matters stood in the time of Giotto. His followers, who studied only"
3827,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"arrangement, probably consulted the antique as little as they consulted"
3828,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,nature; but the contemporary sculptors were brought by the very
3829,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,constitution of their art into close contact both with Nature and with
3830,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the antique; they studied both with determination, and handed over the"
3831,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,results of their labours to the sculptor-taught painters of the
3832,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,fifteenth century.
3833,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3834,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Here, then, were the two great factors in the art of the"
3835,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Renaissance--the study of nature, and the study of the Antique: both"
3836,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"understand slowly, imperfectly; the one counteracting the effect of the"
3837,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"other; the study of nature now scaring away all antique influence, the"
3838,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,study of the antique now distorting all imitation of nature; rival
3839,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"forces confusing the artist and marring the work, until, when each could"
3840,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"receive its due, the one corrected the other, and they combined,"
3841,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,producing by this marriage of the living reality with the dead but
3842,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"immortal beauty, the great art of Michael Angelo, of Raphael, and of"
3843,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Titian: double, like its origin, antique and modern, real and ideal."
3844,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3845,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"The study of the antique is thus placed opposite to the study of nature,"
3846,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the comprehension of the works of Antiquity is the momentary antagonist
3847,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of the comprehension of the works of nature. And this may seem strange,"
3848,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,when we consider that antique art was itself due to perfect
3849,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,comprehension of nature. But the contradiction is easily explained. The
3850,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"study of nature, as it was carried on in the Renaissance, comprised the"
3851,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,study of effects which had remained unnoticed by Antiquity; and the
3852,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"study of the statue,--colourless, without light, shade, or perspective,"
3853,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hampered, and was hampered by, the study of colour, of light and shade,"
3854,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of perspective, and of all that a generation of painters would seek to"
3855,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,learn from nature. Nor was this all; the influence of the civilization
3856,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of the Renaissance, of a civilization directly issued from the Middle"
3857,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Ages, was entirely at variance with the influence of antique"
3858,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,civilization through the medium of ancient art; the Middle Ages and
3859,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Antiquity, Christianity and Paganism, were even more opposed to each"
3860,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"other than could be the statue and the easel picture, the fresco and the"
3861,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,bas-relief.
3862,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3863,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"First, then, we have the hostility between painting--and sculpture,"
3864,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,between the _modus operandi_ of the modern and the _modus operandi_ of
3865,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the ancient art. Antique art is, in the first place, purely linear art,"
3866,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"colourless, tintless, without light and shade; next, it is essentially"
3867,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the art of the isolated figure, without background, grouping, or"
3868,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,perspective. As linear art it could directly affect only that branch of
3869,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,painting which was itself linear; and as art of the isolated figure it
3870,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,was ever being contradicted by the constantly developing arts of
3871,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,perspective and landscape. The antique never' directly influenced the
3872,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Venetians, not from reasons of geography and culture, but from the fact"
3873,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"that Venetian painting, founded from the earliest times upon a system of"
3874,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"colour, could not be affected by antique sculpture, based upon a system"
3875,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of modelled, colourless form; the men who saw form only through the"
3876,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,medium of colour could not learn much from purely linear form; hence it
3877,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,is that even after a certain amount of antique imitation had passed into
3878,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Venetian painting, through the medium of Mantegna, the Venetian painters"
3879,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"display comparatively little antique influence. In Bellini, Carpaccio,"
3880,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Cima, and other early masters, the features, forms, and dress are mainly"
3881,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"modern and Venetian; and Giorgione, Titian, and even the eclectic"
3882,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Tintoret, were more interested in the bright lights of a steel"
3883,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,breastplate than in the shape of a limb; and preferred in their hearts a
3884,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,shot brocade of the sixteenth century to the finest drapery ever
3885,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,modelled by an ancient.
3886,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3887,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,The antique influence was naturally strongest among the Tuscan schools;
3888,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"because the Tuscan schools were essentially schools of drawing, and the"
3889,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,draughtsman recognized in antique sculpture the highest perfection of
3890,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,that linear form which was his own domain. Yet while the antique
3891,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"appealed most to the linear schools, even in these it could strongly"
3892,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,influence only the purely linear part; it is strong in the drawings and
3893,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,weak in the paintings. As long as the artists had only the pencil or
3894,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pen, they could reproduce much of the linear perfection of the antique;"
3895,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"they were, so to speak, alone with it; but as soon as they brought in"
3896,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"colour, perspective, and scenery, the linear perfection was lost in"
3897,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,attempts at something new; the antique was put to flight by the modern.
3898,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Botticelli's crayon study for his Venus is almost antique; his tempera
3899,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"picture of Venus, with the pale blue scaly sea, the laurel grove, the"
3900,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"flower-embroidered garments, the wisps of tawny hair, is comparatively"
3901,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,mediæval; Pinturicchio's sketch of Pans and satyrs contrasts strangely
3902,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"with his frescoes in the library of Siena; Mantegna himself,"
3903,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"supernaturally antique in his engravings, becomes comparatively trivial"
3904,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and modern in his oil-paintings. Do what they might, draw from the"
3905,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"antique and calculate its proportions, the artists of the Renaissance"
3906,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,found themselves baffled as soon as they attempted to apply the result
3907,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,of then linear studies to coloured pictures; as soon as they tried to
3908,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"make the antique unite with the modern, one of the two elements was sure"
3909,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"to succumb. In Botticelli, draughtsman and student though he was, the"
3910,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"modern, the mediæval, that part of the art which had arisen in the"
3911,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Middle Ages, invariably had the upper hand; his Venus, despite her forms"
3912,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,studied from the antique and her gesture imitated from some earlier
3913,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"discovered copy of the Medicean Venus, has the woe-begone prudery of a"
3914,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Madonna or of an abbess; she shivers physically and morally in her
3915,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"unaccustomed nakedness, and the goddess of Spring, who comes skipping up"
3916,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"from beneath the laurel copse, does well to prepare her a mantle, for in"
3917,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the pallid tempera colour, against the dismal background of rippled sea,"
3918,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"this mediæval Venus, at once indecent and prudish, is no very pleasing"
3919,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sight. In the Allegory of Spring in the Academy of Florence, we again"
3920,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,have the antique; goddesses and nymphs whose clinging garments the
3921,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,gentle Sandro Botticelli has assuredly studied from some old statue of
3922,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Agrippina or Faustina; but what strange livid tints are there beneath
3923,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"those draperies, what eccentric gestures are those of the nymphs, what a"
3924,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"green, ghostlike light illumines this garden of Venus Are these"
3925,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"goddesses and nymphs immortal women such as the ancients conceived, or"
3926,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"are they not rather fantastic fairies or nixen, Titanias and Undines,"
3927,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,incorporeal daughters of dew and gossamer and mist?
3928,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3929,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,In Sandro Botticelli the teachings of the statue are forgotten or
3930,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,distorted when the artist takes up his palette and brushes; in his
3931,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"greater contemporary, Andrea Mantegna, the ever-present antique chills"
3932,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and arrests the vitality of the modern. Mantegna, the pupil of the"
3933,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,ancient marbles of Squarcione's workshop even more than the pupil of
3934,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Donatello, studies for his paintings not from nature, but from"
3935,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,sculpture; his figures are seen in strange projection and
3936,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"foreshortening, like figures in a high relief seen from below; despite"
3937,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"his mastery of perspective, they seem hewn out of the background;"
3938,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"despite the rich colours which he displays in his Veronese altar-piece,"
3939,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"they look like painted marbles, with their hard clots of stonelike hair"
3940,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and beard, with their vacant glance and their wonderful draperies,"
3941,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,clinging and weighty like the wet draperies of ancient sculpture. They
3942,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"are beautiful petrifactions, or vivified statues; Mantegna's"
3943,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"masterpiece, the sepia ""Judith"" in Florence, is like an exquisite,"
3944,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pathetically lovely Eurydice, who has stepped unconscious and lifeless"
3945,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,out of a Praxitelian bas-relief. And there are stranger works than even
3946,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the Judith; strange statuesque fancies, like the fight of Marine"
3947,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Monsters and the Bacchanal among Mantegna's engravings. The group of
3948,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"three wondrous creatures, at once men, fish, and gods, is as grand and"
3949,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"even more fantastic than Leonardo's Battle of the Standard: a Triton,"
3950,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sturdy and muscular, with sea-weed beard and hair, wheels round his"
3951,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"finned horse, preparing to strike his adversary with a bunch of fish"
3952,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"which he brandishes above him; on him is rushing, careering on an"
3953,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"osseous sea-horse, a strange, lank, sinewy being, fury stretching every"
3954,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"tendon, his long-clawed feet striking into the flanks of his steed, his"
3955,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sharp, reed-crowned head turned fiercely, with clenched teeth, on his"
3956,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"opponent, and stretching forth a truncheon, ready to run down his enemy"
3957,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"as a ship runs down another; and further off a young Triton, with"
3958,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"clotted hair and heavy eyes, seems ready to sink wounded below the"
3959,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"rippling wavelets, with the massive head and marble agony of the dying"
3960,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Alexander; enigmatic figures, grand and grotesque, lean, haggard,"
3961,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"vehement, and yet, in the midst of violence and monstrosity,"
3962,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"unaccountably antique. The other print, called the Bacchanal, has no"
3963,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,background: half a dozen male figures stand separate and naked as in a
3964,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"bas-relief. Some are leaning against a vine-wreathed tub; a satyr, with"
3965,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"acanthus-leaves growing wondrously out of him, half man, half plant, is"
3966,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"emptying a cup; a heavy Silenus is prone upon the ground; a faun, seated"
3967,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"upon the vat, is supporting in his arms a beautiful sinking youth;"
3968,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"another youth, grand, muscular, and grave as a statue, stands on the"
3969,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"further side. Is this really a bacchanal? Yes, for there is the paunchy"
3970,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Silenus, there are the fauns, there the vat and vine-wreaths and"
3971,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,drinking-horns. And yet it cannot be a bacchanal. Compare with it one of
3972,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Rubens's orgies, where the overgrown, rubicund men and women and fauns"
3973,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"tumble about in tumultuous, riotous intoxication: that is a bacchanal;"
3974,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"they have been drinking, those magnificent brutes, there is wine firing"
3975,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"their blood and weighing down their heads. But here all is different, in"
3976,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,this so-called Bacchanal of Mantegna. This heavy Silenus is supine like
3977,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,a mass of marble; these fauns are shy and mute; these youths are grave
3978,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and sombre; there is no wine in the cups, there are no lees in the vat,"
3979,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,there is no life in these magnificent colossal forms; there is no blood
3980,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"in their grandly bent lips, no light in their wide-opened eyes; it is"
3981,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,not the drowsiness of intoxication which is weighing down the youth
3982,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sustained by the faun; it is no grapejuice which gives that strange,"
3983,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"vague glance. No; they have drunk, but not of any mortal drink; the"
3984,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"grapes are grown in Persephone's garden, the vat contains no fruits that"
3985,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"have ripened beneath our sun. These strange, mute, solemn revellers have"
3986,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"drunk of Lethe, and they are growing cold with the cold of death and of"
3987,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"marble; they are the ghosts of the dead ones of antiquity, revisiting"
3988,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the artist of the Renaissance, who paints them, thinking he is painting"
3989,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"life, while that which he paints is in reality death."
3990,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
3991,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"This anomaly, this unsatisfactory character of the works of both"
3992,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Botticelli and Mantegna, is mainly technical; the antique is frustrated"
3993,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"in Botticelli, not so much by the Christian, the mediæval, the modern"
3994,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mode of feeling, as by the new methods and aims of the new art which"
3995,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,disconcert the methods and aims of the old art; and that which arrests
3996,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Mantegna in his development as a painter is not the spirit of Paganism
3997,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"deadening the spirit of Christianity, but the laws of sculpture"
3998,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hampering painting. But this technical contest between two arts, the one"
3999,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"not yet fully developed, the other not yet fully understood, is as"
4000,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"nothing compared with the contest between the two civilizations, the"
4001,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,antique and the modern; between the habits and tendencies of the
4002,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,contemporaries of the artists of the Renaissance and of the artists
4003,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"themselves, and the habits and tendencies of the antique artists and"
4004,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,their contemporaries. We are apt to think of the Renaissance as of a
4005,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"period closely resembling antiquity, misled by the inevitable similarity"
4006,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,between southern and democratic countries of whatever age; misled still
4007,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,less pardonably by the Ciceronian pedantries and pseudo-antique
4008,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"obscenities of a few humanists, and by the pseudo-Corinthian arabesques"
4009,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,and capitals of a few learned architects. But all this was mere
4010,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,archaeological finery borrowed by a civilization in itself entirely
4011,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,unlike that of ancient Greece.
4012,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4013,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"The Renaissance, let us remember, was merely the flowering time of that"
4014,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,great mediæval movement which had germinated early in the twelfth
4015,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,century; it was merely a more advanced stage of the civilization which
4016,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"had produced Dante and Giotto, of the civilization which was destined to"
4017,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,produce Luther and Rabelais. The fifteenth century was merely the
4018,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"continuation of the fourteenth century, as the fourteenth had been of"
4019,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the thirteenth; there had been growth and improvement; development of
4020,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the more modern, diminishing of the more mediæval elements; but, despite"
4021,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"growth and the changes due to growth, the Renaissance was part and"
4022,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"parcel of the Middle Ages. The life, thought, aspirations, and habits"
4023,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"were mediæval; opposed to the open-air life, the physical training and"
4024,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the materialistic religion of Antiquity. The surroundings of Masaccio
4025,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and of Signorelli, nay, even of Raphael, were very different from those"
4026,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,of Phidias or Praxiteles. Let us think what were the daily and hourly
4027,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"impressions given by the Renaissance to its artists. Large towns, in"
4028,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"which thousands of human beings were crowded together, in narrow, gloomy"
4029,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"streets, with but a strip of blue visible between the projecting roofs;"
4030,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and in these cities an incessant commercial activity, with no relief"
4031,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"save festivals at the churches, brawls at the taverns, and carnival"
4032,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"buffooneries. Men and women pale and meagre for want of air, and light,"
4033,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and movement; undeveloped, untrained bodies, warped by constant work at"
4034,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the loom or at the desk, at best with the lumpish freedom of the soldier"
4035,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,and the vulgar nimbleness of the prentice. And these men and women
4036,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"dressed in the dress of the Middle Ages, gorgeous perhaps in colour, but"
4037,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"heavy, miserable, grotesque, nay, sometimes ludicrous in form; citizens"
4038,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,in lumpish robes and long-tailed caps; ladies in stiff and foldless
4039,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,brocade hoops and stomachers; artizans in striped and close-adhering
4040,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hose and egg-shaped padded jerkin; soldiers in lumbering armour-plates,"
4041,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"ill-fitted over ill-fitting leather, a shapeless shell of iron, bulging"
4042,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"out and angular, in which the body was buried as successfully as in the"
4043,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,robes of the magistrates. Thus we see the men and women of the
4044,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Renaissance in the works of all its painters: heavy in Ghirlandajo,"
4045,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"vulgarly jaunty in Filippino, preposterously starched and prim in"
4046,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Mantegna, ludicrously undignified in Signorelli; while mediæval"
4047,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"stiffness, awkwardness, and absurdity reach their acme perhaps in the"
4048,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"little boys, companions of the Medici children, introduced into Benozzo"
4049,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Gozzoli's Building of Babel. These are the prosperous townsfolk, among"
4050,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,whom the Renaissance artist is but too glad to seek for models; but
4051,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"besides these there are lamentable sights, mediæval beyond words, at"
4052,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"every street corner: dwarfs and cripples, maimed and diseased beggars of"
4053,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"all degrees of loathsomeness, lepers and epileptics, and infinite"
4054,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"numbers of monks, brown, grey, and black, in sack-shaped frocks and"
4055,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pointed hoods, with shaven crown and cropped beard, emaciated with"
4056,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"penance or bloated with gluttony. And all this the painter sees, daily,"
4057,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hourly; it is his standard of humanity, and as such finds its way into"
4058,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,every picture. It is the living; but opposite it arises the dead. Let us
4059,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"turn aside from the crowd of the mediæval city, and look at what the"
4060,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"workmen have just laid bare, or what the merchant has just brought from"
4061,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Rome or from Greece. Look at this: it is corroded by oxides, battered by"
4062,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"ill-usage, stained with earth: it is not a group, not even a whole"
4063,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"statue, it has neither head nor arms remaining; it is a mere broken"
4064,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"fragment of antique sculpture,--a naked body with a fold or two of"
4065,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"drapery; it is not by Phidias nor by Praxiteles, it may not even be"
4066,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Greek; it may be some cheap copy, made for a garden or a bath, in the"
4067,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,days of Hadrian. But to the artist of the fifteenth century it is the
4068,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"revelation of a whole world, a world in itself. We can scarcely realize"
4069,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"all this; but let us look and reflect, and even we may feel as must have"
4070,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"felt the man of the Renaissance in the presence of that mutilated,"
4071,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"stained, battered torso. He sees in that broken stump a grandeur of"
4072,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"outline, a magnificence of osseous structure, a breadth of muscle and"
4073,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"sinew, a smooth, firm covering of flesh, such as he would vainly seek in"
4074,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,any of his living models; he sees a delicate and infinite variety of
4075,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"indentures, of projections, of creases following the bend of every limb;"
4076,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"he sees, where the surface still exists intact, an elasticity of skin, a"
4077,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,buoyancy of hidden life such as all the colours of his palette are
4078,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"unable to imitate; and in this piece of drapery, negligently gathered"
4079,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"over the hips or rolled upon the arm, he sees a magnificent alternation"
4080,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of large folds and small plaits, of straight lines, and broken lines,"
4081,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and curves. He sees all this; but he sees more: the broken torso is, as"
4082,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"we have said, not merely a world in itself, but the revelation of a"
4083,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"world. It is the revelation of antique civilization, of the palaestra"
4084,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and the stadium, of the sanctification of the body, of the apotheosis of"
4085,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"man, of the religion of life and nature and joy; revealed to the man of"
4086,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the Middle Ages, who has hitherto seen in the untrained, diseased,"
4087,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"despised body but a deformed piece of baseness, which his priests tell"
4088,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,him belongs to the worms and to Satan; who has been taught that the monk
4089,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"living in solitude and celibacy, filthy, sick, worn out with fastings"
4090,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and bleeding with flagellation, is the nearest approach to divinity; who"
4091,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"has seen Divinity itself, pale, emaciated, joyless, hanging bleeding"
4092,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,from the cross; and who is for ever reminded that the kingdom of this
4093,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Godhead is not of this world.
4094,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4095,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"What passes in the mind of that artist? What surprise, what dawning"
4096,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"doubts, what sickening fears, what longings and what remorse are not the"
4097,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,fruit of this sight of Antiquity? Is he to yield or to resist? Is he to
4098,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"forget the saints and Christ, and give himself over to Satan and to"
4099,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Antiquity? Only one man boldly answered, Yes. Mantegna abjured his"
4100,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"faith, abjured the Middle Ages, abjured all that belonged to his time;"
4101,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and in so doing cast away from him the living art and became the lover,"
4102,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the worshipper of shadows. And only one man turned completely aside from
4103,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the antique as from the demon, and that man was a saint, Fra Angelico da"
4104,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Fiesole. And with the antique, Fra Angelico rejected all the other"
4105,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"artistic influences and aims of his time, the time not of Giotto or of"
4106,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Orcagna, but of Masaccio and Uccello, of Pollaiolo and Donatello. For the"
4107,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mild, meek, angelic monk dreaded the life of his days; dreaded to leave"
4108,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the cloister where the sunshine was tempered and the noise reduced to a
4109,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"mere faint hum, and where the flower-beds were tidy and prim; dreaded to"
4110,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,soil or rumple his spotless white robe and his shining black cowl; a
4111,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"spiritual sybarite, shrinking from the sight of the crowd seething in"
4112,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the streets, shrinking from the idea of stripping the rags off the"
4113,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,beggar in order to see his tanned and gnarled limbs; shuddering at the
4114,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"thought of seeking for muscles in the dead, cut-open body; fearful of"
4115,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,every whiff of life that might mingle with the incense atmosphere of his
4116,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"chapel, of every cry of human passion which might break through the"
4117,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,well-ordered sweetness of his chants. No; the Renaissance did not exist
4118,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"for him who lived in a world of diaphanous form, colour and character,"
4119,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,unsubstantial and unruffled; dreaming feebly and sweetly of
4120,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,transparent-cheeked Madonnas with no limbs beneath their robes; of
4121,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"smooth-faced saints with well-combed beard and placid, vacant gaze,"
4122,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"seated in well-ordered masses, holy with the purity of inanity; of"
4123,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"divine dolls with pallid flaxen locks, floating between heaven and"
4124,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"earth, playing upon lute and viol and psaltery; raised to faint visions"
4125,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of angels and blessed, moving noiseless, feelingless, meaningless,"
4126,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"across the flowerets of Paradise; of assemblies of saints seated,"
4127,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"arrayed in pure pink, and blue and lilac, in an atmosphere of liquid"
4128,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"gold, in glory. And thus Fra Angelico worked on, content with the dearly"
4129,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"purchased science of his masters, placid, beatic, effeminate, in an"
4130,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"æsthetical paradise of his own, a paradise of sloth and sweetness, a"
4131,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"paradise for weak souls, weak hearts, and weak eyes; patiently repeating"
4132,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"the same fleshless angels, the same boneless saints, the same bloodless"
4133,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"virgins; happy in smoothing the unmixed, unshaded tints of the sky, and"
4134,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"earth, and dresses; laying on the gold of the fretted skies, and of the"
4135,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"iridescent wings, embroidering robes, instruments of music, halos,"
4136,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"flowers, with threads of gold.... Sweet, simple artist saint, reducing"
4137,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,art to--something akin to the delicate pearl and silk embroidery of
4138,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pious nuns, to the exquisite sweetmeat cookery of pious monks; a"
4139,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"something too delicately gorgeous, too deliciously insipid for human"
4140,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"wear or human food; no, the Renaissance does not exist for thee, either"
4141,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"in its study of the existing reality, or in its study of antique beauty."
4142,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4143,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Mantegna, the learned, the archæological, the pagan, who renounces his"
4144,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"times and his faith; and Angelico, the monk, the saint, who shuts and"
4145,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,bolts his monastery doors and sprinkles holy water in the face of the
4146,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"antique; the two extremes, are both exceptions. The innumerable artists"
4147,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,of the Renaissance remained in hesitation; tried to court both the
4148,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"antique and the modern, to unite the Pagan and the Christian--some, like"
4149,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Ghirlandajo, in cold indifference to all but mere artistic science,"
4150,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,encrusting marble bacchanals into the walls of the Virgin's paternal
4151,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"house, bringing together, unthinkingly, antique-draped women carrying"
4152,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"baskets, and noble Strozzi and Ruccellai ladies with gloved hands folded"
4153,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"over their gold brocaded skirts; others, with cheerful and childlike"
4154,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"pleasure in both antique and modern, like Benozzo, crowding together"
4155,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,half-naked youths and nymphs treading the grapes and scaling the
4156,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,trellise with Florentine magnificos in plaited skirts and starched
4157,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"collars, among the pines, and porticos, the sprawling children, barking"
4158,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"dogs, peacocks sunning themselves, and partridges picking up grain, of"
4159,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"his Pisan frescoes; yet others using the antique as mere pageant shows,"
4160,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"allegorical mummeries, destined to amuse some Duke of Ferrara or Marquis"
4161,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of Mantua, together with the hurdle races of Jews, hags, and riderless"
4162,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,donkeys.
4163,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4164,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Thus little by little the antique amalgamates with the modern; the art
4165,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,born of the Middle Ages absorbs the art born of Paganism; but how
4166,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"slowly, and with what fantastic and ludicrous results at first; as when"
4167,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the anatomical sculptor Pollaiolo gives scenes of naked Roman
4168,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,prize-fighters as martyrdoms of St. Sebastian; or when the pious
4169,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Perugino (pious at least with his brush) dresses up his sleek, hectic,"
4170,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"beardless archangels as Roman warriors, and makes them stand, straddling"
4171,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"beatically on thin little dapper legs, wistfully gazing from beneath"
4172,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,their wondrously ornamented helmets on the walls of the Cambio at
4173,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Perugia; when he masquerades meditative fathers of the Church as
4174,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,Socrates and haggard anchorites as Numa Pompilius; most ludicrous of
4175,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"all, when he attires in scantiest of--clinging antique drapery his mild"
4176,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"and pensive Madonnas, and, with daintily pointed toes, places them to"
4177,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,throne bashfully on allegorical chariots as Venus or Diana.
4178,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4179,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Long is the period of amalgamation, and small are the results throughout"
4180,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"that long early Renaissance. Mantegna, Piero della Francesca, Melozzo,"
4181,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Ghirlandajo, Filippino, Botticelli, Verrocchio, have none of them shown"
4182,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,us the perfect fusion of the two elements whose union is to give us
4183,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Michael Angelo, Raphael, and all the great perfect artists of the early"
4184,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,sixteenth century; the two elements are for ever ill-combined and
4185,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"hostile to each other; the modern vulgarizes the antique, the antique"
4186,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"paralyzes the modern. And meanwhile the fifteenth century, the century"
4187,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"of study, of conflict, and of confusion, is rapidly drawing to a close;"
4188,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"eight or ten more years, and it will be gone. Is the new century to find"
4189,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,the antique still dead and the modern still mediæval?
4190,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4191,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,The antique and the modern had met for the first time and as
4192,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,irreconcilable enemies in the cloisters of Pisa; and the modern had
4193,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,triumphed in the great mediæval fresco of the Triumph of Death. By a
4194,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"strange coincidence, by a sublime jest of accident, the antique and the"
4195,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"modern were destined to meet again, and this time indissolubly united,"
4196,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"in a painting representing the Resurrection. Yes, Signorelli's fresco in"
4197,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"Orvieto Cathedral is indeed a resurrection, the resurrection of human"
4198,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,beauty after the long death-slumber of the Middle Ages. And the artist
4199,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,would seem to have been dimly conscious of the great allegory he was
4200,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"painting. Here and there are strewn skulls; skeletons stand leering by,"
4201,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"as if in remembrance of the ghastly past, and as a token of former"
4202,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,death; but magnificent youths are breaking through the crust of the
4203,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"earth, emerging, taking shape and flesh; arising, strong and proud,"
4204,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,ready to go forth at the bidding of the Titanic angels who announce from
4205,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"on high with trumpet blast and waving banners, that the death of the"
4206,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,"world has come to an end, and that humanity has arisen once more in the"
4207,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,youth and beauty of Antiquity.
4208,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4209,SYMMETRIA PRISCA.,
4210,II.,II.
4211,II.,
4212,II.,
4213,II.,"Signorelli's frescoes at Orvieto, at once the latest works of the"
4214,II.,"fifteenth century, and the latest works of an old man nurtured in the"
4215,II.,"traditions of Benozzo Gozzoli and of Piero della Francesca, mark the"
4216,II.,beginning of the maturity and perfection of Italian art. From them
4217,II.,Michael Angelo learns what he could not be taught even by his master
4218,II.,"Ghirlandajo, the grand and cold realist. He learns; and what he has"
4219,II.,learned at Orvieto he teaches with doubled force in Rome; and the
4220,II.,"ceiling of the Sixtine Chapel, the superb and heroic nudities, the"
4221,II.,"majestic draperies, the reappearance in the modern art of painting of"
4222,II.,"the spirit and hand of Phidias, give a new impulse and hasten on"
4223,II.,"perfection. When the doors of the chapel are at length opened, Raphael"
4224,II.,forgets Perugino; Fra Bartolomeo forgets Botticelli; Sodoma forgets
4225,II.,Leonardo; the narrower hesitating styles of the fifteenth century are
4226,II.,"abandoned, as the great example is disseminated throughout Italy; and"
4227,II.,even the tumult of angels in glory which the Lombard Correggio is to
4228,II.,"paint in far-off Parma, and the daringly simple Bacchus and Ariadne with"
4229,II.,which Tintoret will decorate the Ducal Palace more than fifty years
4230,II.,"later--all that is great and bold, all that is a re-incarnation of the"
4231,II.,"spirit of Antiquity, all that marks the culmination of Renaissance art,"
4232,II.,"seems due to the impulse of Michael Angelo, and, through him, to the"
4233,II.,example of Signorelli. From the celestial horseman and bounding avenging
4234,II.,"angels of Raphael's Heliodorus, to the St. Sebastian of Sodoma, with"
4235,II.,"exquisite limbs and head, rich with tendril-like locks, delicate against"
4236,II.,"the brown Umbrian sunset; from the Madonna of Andrea del Sarto seated,"
4237,II.,"with the head and drapery of a Niobe, by the sack of flour in the"
4238,II.,"Annunziata cloister, to the voluptuous goddess, with purple mantle half"
4239,II.,"concealing her body of golden white, who leans against the sculptured"
4240,II.,"fountain in Titian's Sacred and Profane Love, with the greenish blue sky"
4241,II.,and hazy light of evening behind her; from the most extreme examples of
4242,II.,"the most extreme schools of Lombardy and Venetia, to the most intense"
4243,II.,examples of the remotest schools of Tuscany and Umbria; throughout the
4244,II.,"art of the early sixteenth century, of those thirty years which were the"
4245,II.,"years of perfection, we see, more or less marked, but always distinct,"
4246,II.,the union of the living art born of the Middle Ages with the dead art
4247,II.,"left by Antiquity, a union producing life and perfection, producing the"
4248,II.,great art of the Renaissance.
4249,II.,
4250,II.,This much is clear and easy of definition; but what is neither clearly
4251,II.,"understood nor easily defined is the nature of this union, the manner in"
4252,II.,which the antique and the modern did thus amalgamate. It is easy to
4253,II.,"speak of a vague union of spirit, of the antique idea having permeated"
4254,II.,the modern; but all this explains but little: art is not a metaphysical
4255,II.,"figment, and all its phases and revolutions are concrete, and, so to"
4256,II.,"speak, physically explicable and definable. The union of the antique"
4257,II.,with the modern meant simply the absorption by the art of the
4258,II.,"Renaissance of elements of civilization necessary for its perfection,"
4259,II.,but not existing in the medieval civilization of the fifteenth century;
4260,II.,of elements of civilization which gave what the civilization of the
4261,II.,"fifteenth century--which could give colour, perspective, grouping, and"
4262,II.,"landscape--could never have afforded: the nude, drapery, and gesture."
4263,II.,
4264,II.,"The naked human body, which the Greeks had trained, studied, and"
4265,II.,"idolized, did not exist in the fifteenth century; in its stead there was"
4266,II.,"only the undressed body, ill-developed, untrained, pinched, and"
4267,II.,distorted by the garments only just cast off; cramped and bent by
4268,II.,"sedentary occupations, livid with the plague-spots of the Middle Ages,"
4269,II.,"scarred by the whipmarks of asceticism. This stripped body, unseen and"
4270,II.,"unfit to be seen, unaccustomed to the air and to the eyes of others,"
4271,II.,shivered and cowered for cold and for shame. The Giottesques ignored its
4272,II.,"very existence, conceiving humanity as a bodiless creature, with face"
4273,II.,"and hands to express emotion, and just enough malformed legs and feet to"
4274,II.,"be either standing or moving; further, beneath the garments, there was"
4275,II.,nothing. The realists of the fifteenth century tore off the clothes and
4276,II.,drew the ugly thing beneath; and bought the corpses from the
4277,II.,"lazar-houses, and stole them from the gallows; in order to see how bone"
4278,II.,"fitted into bone, and muscle was stretched over muscle. They learned to"
4279,II.,"perfection the anatomy of the human frame, but they could not learn its"
4280,II.,beauty; they became even reconciled to the ugliness they were accustomed
4281,II.,"to see; and, with their minds full of antique examples, Verrocchio,"
4282,II.,"Donatello, Pollaiolo, and Ghirlandajo, the greatest anatomists of the"
4283,II.,"fifteenth century, imitated their coarse and ill-made living models when"
4284,II.,they imagined that they were imitating antique marbles.
4285,II.,
4286,II.,"So much for the nude. Drapery, as the ancients understood it in the"
4287,II.,"delicate plaits of Greek chiton and tunic, in the grand folds of Roman"
4288,II.,"toga, the fifteenth century could not show; it knew only the stiff,"
4289,II.,scanty raiment of the active classes; the shapeless masses of lined
4290,II.,cloth of the merchants and magistrates; the prudish and ostentatious
4291,II.,"starched dress of the women; and the coarse, lumpish garb of the monks."
4292,II.,
4293,II.,"The artist of the fifteenth century knew drapery only as an exotic, an"
4294,II.,exotic with whose representation the habit of seeing mediæval costume
4295,II.,"was for ever interfering; on the stripped, unseemly, indecent body he"
4296,II.,"places, with the stiffness of artificiality, drapery such as he has"
4297,II.,never seen upon any living creature; the result is awkwardness and
4298,II.,"rigidity. And what attitude, what gesture, can he expect from this"
4299,II.,"stripped and artificially draped model? None, for the model scarce knows"
4300,II.,how to stand in so unaccustomed a condition of body. The artist must
4301,II.,"seek for attitude and gesture among his townsfolk, and among them he can"
4302,II.,"find only trivial, awkward, often vulgar movement. They have never been"
4303,II.,taught how to stand or to move with grace and dignity; the artist must
4304,II.,study attitude and gesture in the market-place or the bull-baiting
4305,II.,"ground, where Ghirlandajo found his jauntily strutting idlers, and"
4306,II.,Verrocchio his brutally staggering prize-fighters. Between the
4307,II.,"constrained attitudinizing of Byzantine and Giottesque tradition, and"
4308,II.,"the imitation of the movements of clodhoppers and ragamuffins, the"
4309,II.,realist of the fifteenth century would wander hopelessly were it not for
4310,II.,the antique. Genius and science are of no avail; the position of Christ
4311,II.,in baptism in the paintings of Verrocchio and Ghirlandajo is mean and
4312,II.,"servile; the movements of the ""Thunder-stricken"" in Signorelli's"
4313,II.,"lunettes is an inconceivable mixture of the brutish, the melodramatic,"
4314,II.,and the comic; the magnificently drawn youth at the door of the prison
4315,II.,in Filippino's Liberation of St. Peter is gradually going to sleep and
4316,II.,collapsing in a fashion which is truly ignoble.
4317,II.,
4318,II.,And the same applies to sculptured figures or to figures standing
4319,II.,isolated like statues; no Greek would have ventured upon the swaggering
4320,II.,"position, with legs apart and elbows out, of Donatello's St. George, or"
4321,II.,Perugino's St. Michael; and a young Athenian who should have assumed the
4322,II.,"attitude of Verrocchio's David, with tripping legs and hand clapped on"
4323,II.,"his hip, would have been sent to sit in a corner as a saucy little"
4324,II.,ragamuffin.
4325,II.,
4326,II.,"Coarse nude, stiff drapery, vulgar attitude, was all that the fifteenth"
4327,II.,century could offer to its artists; but Antiquity could offer more and
4328,II.,very different things: the naked body developed by the most artistic
4329,II.,"training, drapery the most natural and refined, and attitude and gesture"
4330,II.,regulated by an education the most careful and artistic; and all these
4331,II.,things Antiquity did give to the artists of the Renaissance. They did
4332,II.,"not copy antique statues as living naked men and women, but they"
4333,II.,corrected the faults of their living models by the example of the
4334,II.,"statues; they did not copy antique stone draperies in coloured pictures,"
4335,II.,but they arranged the robes on their models with the antique folds well
4336,II.,in their memory; they did not give the gestures of statues to living
4337,II.,"figures, but they made the living figures move in accordance with those"
4338,II.,principles of harmony which they had found exemplified in the statues.
4339,II.,
4340,II.,"They did not imitate the antique, they studied it; they obtained through"
4341,II.,"the fragments of antique sculpture a glimpse into the life of antiquity,"
4342,II.,and that glimpse served to correct the vulgarism and distortion of the
4343,II.,mediæval life of the fifteenth century. In the perfection of Italian
4344,II.,"painting, the union of antique and modern being consummated, it is"
4345,II.,perhaps difficult to disentangle what really is antique from what is
4346,II.,"modern; but in the earlier times, when the two elements were still"
4347,II.,"separate, we can see them opposite each other and compare them in the"
4348,II.,"works of the greatest artists. Wherever, in the paintings of the early"
4349,II.,"Renaissance, there is realism, marked by the costume of the times, there"
4350,II.,"is ugliness of form and vulgarity of movement; where there is idealism,"
4351,II.,"marked by imitation of the antique, the nude, and drapery, there is"
4352,II.,beauty and dignity. We need only compare Filippino's Scene before the
4353,II.,Proconsul with his Raising of the King's Son in the Brancacci Chapel;
4354,II.,the grand attitude and draperies of Ghirlandajo's Zachariah with the
4355,II.,vulgar dress and movements of the Florentine citizens surrounding him;
4356,II.,"Benozzo Gozzoli's noble naked figure of Noah with his ungainly,"
4357,II.,hideously dressed figure of Cosimo de' Medici; Mantegna's exquisite
4358,II.,"Judith with his preposterous Marquis of Mantua; in short, all the purely"
4359,II.,realistic with all the purely idealistic painting of the fifteenth
4360,II.,century. We may give one last instance. In Signorelli's Orvieto frescoes
4361,II.,"there is a figure of a young man, with aquiline features, long crisp"
4362,II.,"hair and strongly developed throat, which reappears unmistakably in all"
4363,II.,"the compositions, and in some of them twice and thrice in various"
4364,II.,"positions. His naked figure is magnificent, his attitudes splendid, his"
4365,II.,"thrown-back head superb, whether he be slowly and painfully emerging"
4366,II.,"from the earth, staggered and gasping with his newly infused life, or"
4367,II.,"sinking oppressed on the ground, broken and crushed by the sound of the"
4368,II.,trumpet of judgment; or whether he be moving forward with ineffable
4369,II.,longing towards the angel about to award him the crown of the blessed;
4370,II.,"in all these positions he is heroically beautiful. We meet him again,"
4371,II.,"unmistakable, but how different, in the realistic group of the"
4372,II.,"""Thunder-stricken ""--the long, lank youth, with spindle-shanks and"
4373,II.,"egg-shaped body, bounding forward, with most grotesque strides, over the"
4374,II.,"uncouth heap of dead bodies, ungainly masses with soles and nostrils"
4375,II.,"uppermost, lying in beast-like confusion. This youth, with something of"
4376,II.,a harlequin in his jumps and his ridiculous thin legs and preposterous
4377,II.,"round body, is evidently the model for the naked demi-gods of the"
4378,II.,Resurrection and the Paradise: he is the handsome boy as the fifteenth
4379,II.,"century gave him to Signorelli; opposite, he is the living youth of the"
4380,II.,fifteenth century idealized by the study of ancient sculpture; just as
4381,II.,"the ""Thunder-stricken"" may be some scene of street massacre such as"
4382,II.,Signorelli might have witnessed at Cortona or Perugia; while the agonies
4383,II.,"of the ""Hell"" are the grouped and superb agonies taught by the antique;"
4384,II.,"just as the two archangels of the ""Hell,"" in their armour of Baglioni's"
4385,II.,"heavy cavalry, may represent the modern element, and the same"
4386,II.,"archangels, naked, with magnificent flying draperies, blowing the"
4387,II.,"trumpets of the Resurrection, may show the antique element in"
4388,II.,Renaissance art.
4389,II.,
4390,II.,"The antique influence was not, indeed, equally strong throughout Italy;"
4391,II.,"it was strongest in the Tuscan school, which, seeking for perfection of"
4392,II.,"linear form, found that perfection in the antique; it was weakest in the"
4393,II.,"Lombard and Venetian schools, which sought for what the antique could"
4394,II.,"not give, light and shade and colour; the antique was most efficacious"
4395,II.,"where it was most indispensable, and it was more necessary to a Tuscan,"
4396,II.,"strong only with his charcoal or pencil, than to Leonardo da Vinci, who"
4397,II.,"could make an imperfect figure, beckoning mysteriously from out of the"
4398,II.,"gloom, more fascinating than the finest drawn Florentine Madonna, and"
4399,II.,could surround an insignificant childish head with the wondrous sheen
4400,II.,"and ripple of hair, as with an aureole of poetry; it was also less"
4401,II.,"necessary to Giorgione and Titian, who could hide coarse limbs beneath"
4402,II.,"their draperies of precious ruby, and transfigure, by the liquid gold of"
4403,II.,"their palettes, a peasant woman into a goddess. But even the Lombards,"
4404,II.,"even the Venetians, required the antique influence. They could not"
4405,II.,perhaps have obtained it direct like the Tuscans: the colourists and
4406,II.,masters of light and shade might never have understood the blank lines
4407,II.,and faint shadows of the marble; but they received the antique
4408,II.,"influence, strong but modified by the medium through which it had"
4409,II.,"passed, from Mantegna; and the relentless self-sacrifice to Antiquity,"
4410,II.,"the self-paralyzation of the great artist, was not without its use: from"
4411,II.,"Venetian Padua, Mantegna influenced the Bellini and Giorgione; from"
4412,II.,"Lombard Mantua, he influenced Leonardo; and Mantegna's influence was"
4413,II.,that of the antique.
4414,II.,
4415,II.,What would have been the art of the Renaissance without the antique? The
4416,II.,"speculation is vain, for the antique had influenced it, had been goading"
4417,II.,"it on ever since the earliest times; it had been present at its birth,"
4418,II.,"it had affected Giotto through Niccolò Pisano, and Masaccio through"
4419,II.,Ghiberti; the antique influence cannot be conceived as absent in the
4420,II.,"history of Italian painting. So far, as a study of the impossible, the"
4421,II.,speculation respecting the fate of Renaissance art had it not been
4422,II.,influenced by the antique would be childishly useless. But lest we
4423,II.,"forget that this antique influence did exist, lest, grown ungrateful and"
4424,II.,"blind, we refuse it its immense share in producing Michael Angelo,"
4425,II.,"Raphael, and Titian, we may do well to turn to an art born and bred like"
4426,II.,"Italian art, in the Middle Ages; like it, full of strength and power of"
4427,II.,"self-development, but which, unlike Italian art, was not influenced by"
4428,II.,the antique. This art is the great German art of the early sixteenth
4429,II.,"century; the art of Martin Schongauer, of Aldegrever, of Altdorfer, of"
4430,II.,"Wohlgemuth, of Kranach, of Albrecht Dürer and Hans Holbein, whom they"
4431,II.,"resemble as Pinturicchio and Lo Spagna resemble Perugino, as Palma and"
4432,II.,Paris Bordone resemble Titian. This is an art born in a civilization
4433,II.,"less perfect indeed than that of Italy, narrower, as Nürnberg or Basle"
4434,II.,"is narrower than Florence; but resembling it in habits, dress, religion,"
4435,II.,"above all, the main characteristic of being mediæval; and its masters,"
4436,II.,as great as their Italian contemporaries in all the technicalities of
4437,II.,"the art, and In absolute honesty of endeavour, may show what the Italian"
4438,II.,art of the sixteenth century might have been without the antique. Let us
4439,II.,therefore open a portfolio of those wonderful minute yet grand
4440,II.,engravings of the old Germans. They are for the most part Scriptural
4441,II.,"scenes or allegories, quite analogous to those of the Italians, but"
4442,II.,"purely realistic, conscious of no world beyond that of an Imperial City"
4443,II.,"of the year 1520. Here we have the whole turn-out, male and female, of a"
4444,II.,"German free-town, in the shape of scenes from the lives of the Virgin"
4445,II.,"and saints; here are short fat burghers, with enormous blotchy, bloated"
4446,II.,"faces and little eyes set in fat, their huge stomachs protruding from"
4447,II.,"under their jackets; here are blear-eyed ladies, tall, thin, wrinkled"
4448,II.,"though not old, with figures like hungry harpies, stalking about in high"
4449,II.,"headgears and stiff gowns, or sitting by the side of lean and stunted"
4450,II.,"pages, singing (with dolorous voice) to lutes; or promenading under"
4451,II.,"trees with long-shanked, high-shouldered gentlemen, with vacant sickly"
4452,II.,"face and long scraggy hair and beard, their bony elbows sticking out of"
4453,II.,their slashed doublets. These courtly figures culminate in Dürer's
4454,II.,"magnificent plate of the wild man of the woods kissing the hideous,"
4455,II.,leering Jezebel in her brocade and jewels. These aristocratic women are
4456,II.,"terrible; prudish, malicious, licentious, never modest because they are"
4457,II.,"always ugly. Even the poor Madonnas, seated in front of village hovels"
4458,II.,"or windmills, smile the smile of starved, sickly sempstresses. It is a"
4459,II.,"stunted, poverty-stricken, plague-sick society, this mediæval society of"
4460,II.,"burghers and burghers' wives; the air seems bad and heavy, and the light"
4461,II.,"wanting physically and morally, in these old free-towns; there is"
4462,II.,intellectual sickness as well as bodily in those musty gabled houses;
4463,II.,the mediæval spirit blights what revival of healthiness may exist in
4464,II.,these commonwealths. And feudalism is outside the gates. There are the
4465,II.,"brutal, leering men-at-arms, in slashed, puffed doublets and heavy"
4466,II.,"armour, face and dress as unhuman as possible, standing grimacing at the"
4467,II.,"blood spirting from John the Baptist's decapitated trunk, as in"
4468,II.,"Kranach's horrible print, while gaping spectators fill the castle-yard;"
4469,II.,"there are the castles high on rocks amidst woods, with miserable"
4470,II.,"villages below, where the Prodigal Son wallows among the swine, and the"
4471,II.,"tattered boors tumble about in drunkenness, or rest wearied on their"
4472,II.,spades. There are the Middle Ages in full force. But had these Germans
4473,II.,of the days of Luther really no thought beyond their own times and their
4474,II.,own country? Had they really no knowledge of the antique? Not so; they
4475,II.,"had heard from their learned men, from Willibald Pirkheimer and Ulrich"
4476,II.,"von Hutten, that the world had once been peopled with naked gods and"
4477,II.,"goddesses. Nay, the very year perhaps that Raphael handed to his"
4478,II.,"engraver, Marc Antonio, his magnificent drawing of the Judgment of"
4479,II.,"Paris, Lukas Kranach bethought him to represent the story of the good"
4480,II.,Knight Paris giving the apple to the Lady Venus. So Kranach took up his
4481,II.,"steady pencil and sharp chisel, and in strong, clear, minute lines of"
4482,II.,"black and white showed us the scene. There, on Mount Ida, with a"
4483,II.,"castellated rock in the distance, the charger of Paris browses beneath"
4484,II.,"some stunted larches; the Trojan knight's helmet, with its monstrous"
4485,II.,"beak and plume, lies on the ground; and near it reclines Paris himself,"
4486,II.,"lazy, in complete armour, with frizzled fashionable beard. To him, all"
4487,II.,"wrinkled and grinning with brutal lust, comes another bearded knight,"
4488,II.,"with wings to his vizored helmet, Sir Mercury, leading the three"
4489,II.,"goddesses, short, fat-cheeked German wenches, housemaids stripped of"
4490,II.,"their clothes, stupid, brazen, indifferent. And Paris is evidently"
4491,II.,"prepared with his choice: he awards the apple to the fattest, for among"
4492,II.,"a half-starved, plague-stricken people like this, the chosen of gods and"
4493,II.,men must needs be the fattest.
4494,II.,
4495,II.,"No, such pagan scenes are mere burlesques, coarse mummeries, such as may"
4496,II.,"have amused Nürnberg and Augsburg during Shrovetide, when drunken louts"
4497,II.,figured as Bacchus and sang drinking songs by Hans Sachs. There is no
4498,II.,reality in all this; there is no belief in pagan gods. If we would see
4499,II.,"the haunting divinity of the German Renaissance, we shall find him"
4500,II.,"prying and prowling in nearly every scene of real life; him, the ever"
4501,II.,"present, the king of the Middle Ages, whose triumph we have seen on the"
4502,II.,"cloister wall at Pisa, the Lord Death. His fleshless face peers from"
4503,II.,"behind a bush at Zatzinger's stunted, fever-stricken lady and imbecile"
4504,II.,"gentleman; he sits grinning on a tree in Orso Grafs allegory, while the"
4505,II.,"cynical knights, with haggard, sensual faces, crack dirty jokes with the"
4506,II.,"fat, brutish woman squatted below; he puts his hand into the basket of"
4507,II.,Dürer's tattered pedlar; he leers hideously at the stirrup of Dürer's
4508,II.,"armed and stalwart knight. No gods of youth and nature, no Hercules, no"
4509,II.,"Hermes, no Venus, have invaded his German territories, as they invaded"
4510,II.,"even his own palace, the burial-ground at Pisa; the antique has not"
4511,II.,"perverted Dürer and his fellows, as it perverted Masaccio and Signorelli"
4512,II.,"and Mantegna, from the mediæval worship of Death."
4513,II.,
4514,II.,The Italians had seen the antique and had let themselves be seduced by
4515,II.,"it, despite their civilization and their religion. Let us only rejoice"
4516,II.,"thereat. There are indeed some, and among them the great English critic"
4517,II.,"who is irrefutable when he is a poet, and irrational when he becomes a"
4518,II.,philosopher;--there are some who tell us that in its union with antique
4519,II.,"art, the art of the followers of Giotto embraced death, and rotted away"
4520,II.,"ever after. There are others, more moderate but less logical, who would"
4521,II.,"teach us that in uniting with the antique, the mediæval art of the"
4522,II.,fifteenth century purified and sanctified the beautiful but evil child
4523,II.,of Paganism; that the goddess of Scopas and the athlete of Polyclete
4524,II.,were raised to a higher sphere when Raphael changed the one into a
4525,II.,"Madonna, and Michael Angelo metamorphosed the other into a prophet. But"
4526,II.,both schools of criticism are wrong. Every civilization has its inherent
4527,II.,"evil; Antiquity had its inherent evils, as the Middle Ages had theirs;"
4528,II.,"Antiquity may have bequeathed to the Renaissance the bad with the good,"
4529,II.,as the Middle Ages had bequeathed to the Renaissance the good with the
4530,II.,"bad. But the art of Antiquity was not the evil, it was the good of"
4531,II.,"Antiquity; it was born of its strength and its purity only, and it was"
4532,II.,"the incarnation of its noblest qualities. It could not be purified,"
4533,II.,"because it was spotless; it could not be sanctified, because it was"
4534,II.,"holy. It could gain nothing from the art of the Middle Ages, alternately"
4535,II.,"strong in brutal reality, and languid in mystic inanity; the men of the"
4536,II.,"Renaissance could, if they influenced it at all, influence the antique"
4537,II.,"only for evil; they belonged to an inferior artistic civilization, and"
4538,II.,if we conscientiously seek for the spiritual improvements brought by
4539,II.,"them into antique types, we shall see that they consist in spoiling"
4540,II.,their perfect proportions; in making necks longer and muscles more
4541,II.,"prominent; in rendering more or less flaccid, or meagre or coarse, the"
4542,II.,grand and delicate forms of antique art. And when we have examined into
4543,II.,"this purified art of the Renaissance, when we have compared coolly and"
4544,II.,"equitably, we may perhaps confess that, while the Renaissance added"
4545,II.,"immense wealth of beauty in colour, perspective, and grouping, it took"
4546,II.,away something of the perfection of simple lines and modest light and
4547,II.,shade of the antique; we may admit to ourselves that the grandest saint
4548,II.,by Raphael is meagre and stunted; and the noblest Virgin by Titian is
4549,II.,overblown and sensual by the side of the demi-gods and amazons of
4550,II.,antique sculpture.
4551,II.,
4552,II.,"The antique perfected the art of the Renaissance, it did not corrupt it."
4553,II.,The art of the Renaissance fell indeed into shameful degradation soon
4554,II.,after the period of its triumphant union with the antique; and Raphael's
4555,II.,"grand gods and goddesses, his exquisite Eros and radiant Psyche of the"
4556,II.,"Farnesina, are indeed succeeded but too soon by the Olympus of Giulio"
4557,II.,"Romano, an Olympus of harlots and acrobats, who smirk and mouth and"
4558,II.,wriggle and sprawl ignobly on the walls and ceilings of the dismantled
4559,II.,"palace which crumbles away among the stunted willows, the stagnant"
4560,II.,"pools, and rank grass of the marshes of Mantua. But this is no more the"
4561,II.,fault of Antiquity than it is the fault of the Middle Ages; it is the
4562,II.,fault of that great principle of life and of change which makes all
4563,II.,"things organic, be they physical or intellectual, germinate, grow,"
4564,II.,"attain maturity, and then fade, wither, and rot. The dead art of"
4565,II.,Antiquity could never have brought the art of the Renaissance to an
4566,II.,"untimely end; the art of the Renaissance decayed because it was mature,"
4567,II.,and died because it had lived.
