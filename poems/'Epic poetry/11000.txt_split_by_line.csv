77,I.,I.
78,I.,
79,I.,
80,I.,The Gilgamesh Epic is the most notable literary product of Babylonia as
81,I.,yet discovered in the mounds of Mesopotamia. It recounts the exploits
82,I.,"and adventures of a favorite hero, and in its final form covers twelve"
83,I.,"tablets, each tablet consisting of six columns (three on the obverse"
84,I.,"and three on the reverse) of about 50 lines for each column, or a total"
85,I.,"of about 3600 lines. Of this total, however, barely more than one-half"
86,I.,has been found among the remains of the great collection of cuneiform
87,I.,tablets gathered by King Ashurbanapal (668-626 B.C.) in his palace
88,I.,"at Nineveh, and discovered by Layard in 1854 [1] in the course of his"
89,I.,excavations of the mound Kouyunjik (opposite Mosul). The fragments of
90,I.,the epic painfully gathered--chiefly by George Smith--from the _circa_
91,I.,"30,000 tablets and bits of tablets brought to the British Museum were"
92,I.,published in model form by Professor Paul Haupt; [2] and that edition
93,I.,still remains the primary source for our study of the Epic.
94,I.,
95,I.,For the sake of convenience we may call the form of the Epic in the
96,I.,"fragments from the library of Ashurbanapal the Assyrian version,"
97,I.,though like most of the literary productions in the library it not
98,I.,"only reverts to a Babylonian original, but represents a late copy of"
99,I.,a much older original. The absence of any reference to Assyria in
100,I.,the fragments recovered justifies us in assuming that the Assyrian
101,I.,"version received its present form in Babylonia, perhaps in Erech;"
102,I.,"though it is of course possible that some of the late features,"
103,I.,particularly the elaboration of the teachings of the theologians or
104,I.,"schoolmen in the eleventh and twelfth tablets, may have been produced"
105,I.,at least in part under Assyrian influence. A definite indication
106,I.,that the Gilgamesh Epic reverts to a period earlier than Hammurabi
107,I.,"(or Hammurawi) [3] i.e., beyond 2000 B. C., was furnished by the"
108,I.,publication of a text clearly belonging to the first Babylonian
109,I.,"dynasty (of which Hammurabi was the sixth member) in _CT_. VI, 5;"
110,I.,"which text Zimmern [4] recognized as a part of the tale of Atra-hasis,"
111,I.,"one of the names given to the survivor of the deluge, recounted on"
112,I.,the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic. [5] This was confirmed
113,I.,by the discovery [6] of a fragment of the deluge story dated in the
114,I.,"eleventh year of Ammisaduka, i.e., c. 1967 B.C. In this text, likewise,"
115,I.,"the name of the deluge hero appears as Atra-hasis (col. VIII, 4). [7]"
116,I.,But while these two tablets do not belong to the Gilgamesh Epic and
117,I.,merely introduce an episode which has also been incorporated into the
118,I.,"Epic, Dr. Bruno Meissner in 1902 published a tablet, dating, as the"
119,I.,"writing and the internal evidence showed, from the Hammurabi period,"
120,I.,which undoubtedly is a portion of what by way of distinction we may
121,I.,call an old Babylonian version. [8] It was picked up by Dr. Meissner
122,I.,at a dealer's shop in Bagdad and acquired for the Berlin Museum. The
123,I.,tablet consists of four columns (two on the obverse and two on the
124,I.,reverse) and deals with the hero's wanderings in search of a cure
125,I.,from disease with which he has been smitten after the death of his
126,I.,companion Enkidu. The hero fears that the disease will be fatal and
127,I.,longs to escape death. It corresponds to a portion of Tablet X of
128,I.,"the Assyrian version. Unfortunately, only the lower portion of the"
129,I.,obverse and the upper of the reverse have been preserved (57 lines
130,I.,in all); and in default of a colophon we do not know the numeration
131,I.,"of the tablet in this old Babylonian edition. Its chief value,"
132,I.,apart from its furnishing a proof for the existence of the Epic
133,I.,"as early as 2000 B. C., lies (a) in the writing _Gish_ instead of"
134,I.,"Gish-gi(n)-mash in the Assyrian version, for the name of the hero,"
135,I.,"(b) in the writing En-ki-du--abbreviated from dug--""Enki is"
136,I.,"good"" for En-ki-dú in the Assyrian version, [9] and (c) in the"
137,I.,"remarkable address of the maiden Sabitum, dwelling at the seaside,"
138,I.,to whom Gilgamesh comes in the course of his wanderings. From the
139,I.,Assyrian version we know that the hero tells the maiden of his grief
140,I.,"for his lost companion, and of his longing to escape the dire fate of"
141,I.,Enkidu. In the old Babylonian fragment the answer of Sabitum is given
142,I.,"in full, and the sad note that it strikes, showing how hopeless it"
143,I.,"is for man to try to escape death which is in store for all mankind,"
144,I.,"is as remarkable as is the philosophy of ""eat, drink and be merry"""
145,I.,which Sabitum imparts. The address indicates how early the tendency
146,I.,arose to attach to ancient tales the current religious teachings.
147,I.,
148,I.,
149,I.,"""Why, O Gish, does thou run about?"
150,I.,"The life that thou seekest, thou wilt not find."
151,I.,"When the gods created mankind,"
152,I.,Death they imposed on mankind;
153,I.,Life they kept in their power.
154,I.,"Thou, O Gish, fill thy belly,"
155,I.,"Day and night do thou rejoice,"
156,I.,Daily make a rejoicing!
157,I.,Day and night a renewal of jollification!
158,I.,"Let thy clothes be clean,"
159,I.,Wash thy head and pour water over thee!
160,I.,Care for the little one who takes hold of thy hand!
161,I.,"Let the wife rejoice in thy bosom!"""
162,I.,
163,I.,
164,I.,"Such teachings, reminding us of the leading thought in the Biblical"
165,I.,"Book of Ecclesiastes, [10] indicate the _didactic_ character given to"
166,I.,"ancient tales that were of popular origin, but which were modified"
167,I.,and elaborated under the influence of the schools which arose in
168,I.,"connection with the Babylonian temples. The story itself belongs,"
169,I.,"therefore, to a still earlier period than the form it received in this"
170,I.,old Babylonian version. The existence of this tendency at so early a
171,I.,"date comes to us as a genuine surprise, and justifies the assumption"
172,I.,that the attachment of a lesson to the deluge story in the Assyrian
173,I.,"version, to wit, the limitation in attainment of immortality to those"
174,I.,"singled out by the gods as exceptions, dates likewise from the old"
175,I.,"Babylonian period. The same would apply to the twelfth tablet, which"
176,I.,"is almost entirely didactic, intended to illustrate the impossibility"
177,I.,of learning anything of the fate of those who have passed out of this
178,I.,world. It also emphasizes the necessity of contenting oneself with the
179,I.,"comfort that the care of the dead, by providing burial and food and"
180,I.,"drink offerings for them affords, as the only means of ensuring for"
181,I.,"them rest and freedom from the pangs of hunger and distress. However,"
182,I.,"it is of course possible that the twelfth tablet, which impresses"
183,I.,"one as a supplement to the adventures of Gilgamesh, ending with his"
184,I.,"return to Uruk (i.e., Erech) at the close of the eleventh tablet, may"
185,I.,represent a _later_ elaboration of the tendency to connect religious
186,I.,teachings with the exploits of a favorite hero.
187,I.,
188,I.,
189,I.,
190,II.,II.
191,II.,
192,II.,
193,II.,We now have further evidence both of the extreme antiquity of the
194,II.,literary form of the Gilgamesh Epic and also of the disposition to
195,II.,make the Epic the medium of illustrating aspects of life and the
196,II.,destiny of mankind. The discovery by Dr. Arno Poebel of a Sumerian
197,II.,form of the tale of the descent of Ishtar to the lower world and her
198,II.,release [11]--apparently a nature myth to illustrate the change of
199,II.,season from summer to winter and back again to spring--enables us to
200,II.,pass beyond the Akkadian (or Semitic) form of tales current in the
201,II.,"Euphrates Valley to the Sumerian form. Furthermore, we are indebted"
202,II.,to Dr. Langdon for the identification of two Sumerian fragments in the
203,II.,"Nippur Collection which deal with the adventures of Gilgamesh, one in"
204,II.,"Constantinople, [12] the other in the collection of the University"
205,II.,"of Pennsylvania Museum. [13] The former, of which only 25 lines are"
206,II.,"preserved (19 on the obverse and 6 on the reverse), appears to be a"
207,II.,description of the weapons of Gilgamesh with which he arms himself
208,II.,"for an encounter--presumably the encounter with Humbaba or Huwawa,"
209,II.,the ruler of the cedar forest in the mountain. [14] The latter deals
210,II.,with the building operations of Gilgamesh in the city of Erech. A
211,II.,text in Zimmern's _Sumerische Kultlieder aus altbabylonischer Zeit_
212,II.,"(Leipzig, 1913), No. 196, appears likewise to be a fragment of the"
213,II.,"Sumerian version of the Gilgamesh Epic, bearing on the episode of"
214,II.,"Gilgamesh's and Enkidu's relations to the goddess Ishtar, covered in"
215,II.,the sixth and seventh tablets of the Assyrian version. [15]
216,II.,
217,II.,"Until, however, further fragments shall have turned up, it would"
218,II.,be hazardous to institute a comparison between the Sumerian and the
219,II.,Akkadian versions. All that can be said for the present is that there
220,II.,is every reason to believe in the existence of a literary form of the
221,II.,"Epic in Sumerian which presumably antedated the Akkadian recension,"
222,II.,just as we have a Sumerian form of Ishtar's descent into the nether
223,II.,"world, and Sumerian versions of creation myths, as also of the"
224,II.,"Deluge tale. [16] It does not follow, however, that the Akkadian"
225,II.,"versions of the Gilgamesh Epic are translations of the Sumerian,"
226,II.,any more than that the Akkadian creation myths are translations of
227,II.,"a Sumerian original. Indeed, in the case of the creation myths,"
228,II.,the striking difference between the Sumerian and Akkadian views
229,II.,of creation [17] points to the independent production of creation
230,II.,"stories on the part of the Semitic settlers of the Euphrates Valley,"
231,II.,though no doubt these were worked out in part under Sumerian literary
232,II.,"influences. The same is probably true of Deluge tales, which would"
233,II.,be given a distinctly Akkadian coloring in being reproduced and
234,II.,steadily elaborated by the Babylonian _literati_ attached to the
235,II.,"temples. The presumption is, therefore, in favor of an independent"
236,II.,"_literary_ origin for the Semitic versions of the Gilgamesh Epic,"
237,II.,"though naturally with a duplication of the episodes, or at least of"
238,II.,"some of them, in the Sumerian narrative. Nor does the existence of a"
239,II.,Sumerian form of the Epic necessarily prove that it originated with
240,II.,the Sumerians in their earliest home before they came to the Euphrates
241,II.,Valley. They may have adopted it after their conquest of southern
242,II.,"Babylonia from the Semites who, there are now substantial grounds for"
243,II.,"believing, were the earlier settlers in the Euphrates Valley. [18]"
244,II.,"We must distinguish, therefore, between the earliest _literary_ form,"
245,II.,"which was undoubtedly Sumerian, and the _origin_ of the episodes"
246,II.,"embodied in the Epic, including the chief actors, Gilgamesh and his"
247,II.,"companion Enkidu. It will be shown that one of the chief episodes,"
248,II.,the encounter of the two heroes with a powerful guardian or ruler
249,II.,"of a cedar forest, points to a western region, more specifically to"
250,II.,"Amurru, as the scene. The names of the two chief actors, moreover,"
251,II.,"appear to have been ""Sumerianized"" by an artificial process, [19]"
252,II.,"and if this view turns out to be correct, we would have a further"
253,II.,ground for assuming the tale to have originated among the Akkadian
254,II.,settlers and to have been taken over from them by the Sumerians.

259,III.,
260,III.,
261,III.,"New light on the earliest Babylonian version of the Epic, as well"
262,III.,"as on the Assyrian version, has been shed by the recovery of two"
263,III.,substantial fragments of the form which the Epic had assumed in
264,III.,Babylonia in the Hammurabi period. The study of this important new
265,III.,material also enables us to advance the interpretation of the Epic
266,III.,and to perfect the analysis into its component parts. In the spring
267,III.,"of 1914, the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania acquired by"
268,III.,"purchase a large tablet, the writing of which as well as the style"
269,III.,and the manner of spelling verbal forms and substantives pointed
270,III.,distinctly to the time of the first Babylonian dynasty. The tablet
271,III.,"was identified by Dr. Arno Poebel as part of the Gilgamesh Epic; and,"
272,III.,"as the colophon showed, it formed the second tablet of the series. He"
273,III.,"copied it with a view to publication, but the outbreak of the war which"
274,III.,found him in Germany--his native country--prevented him from carrying
275,III.,"out this intention. [20] He, however, utilized some of its contents in"
276,III.,his discussion of the historical or semi-historical traditions about
277,III.,"Gilgamesh, as revealed by the important list of partly mythical and"
278,III.,"partly historical dynasties, found among the tablets of the Nippur"
279,III.,"collection, in which Gilgamesh occurs [21] as a King of an Erech"
280,III.,"dynasty, whose father was Â, a priest of Kulab. [22]"
281,III.,
282,III.,The publication of the tablet was then undertaken by Dr. Stephen
283,III.,"Langdon in monograph form under the title, ""The Epic of"
284,III.,"Gilgamish."" [23] In a preliminary article on the tablet in the"
285,III.,"_Museum Journal_, Vol. VIII, pages 29-38, Dr. Langdon took the"
286,III.,"tablet to be of the late Persian period (i.e., between the sixth"
287,III.,"and third century B. C.), but his attention having been called to"
288,III.,"this error of some _1500 years_, he corrected it in his introduction"
289,III.,"to his edition of the text, though he neglected to change some of"
290,III.,"his notes in which he still refers to the text as ""late."" [24] In"
291,III.,"addition to a copy of the text, accompanied by a good photograph,"
292,III.,Dr. Langdon furnished a transliteration and translation with some
293,III.,notes and a brief introduction. The text is unfortunately badly
294,III.,"copied, being full of errors; and the translation is likewise very"
295,III.,defective. A careful collation with the original tablet was made with
296,III.,"the assistance of Dr. Edward Chiera, and as a consequence we are in a"
297,III.,position to offer to scholars a correct text. We beg to acknowledge
298,III.,"our obligations to Dr. Gordon, the Director of the Museum of the"
299,III.,"University of Pennsylvania, for kindly placing the tablet at our"
300,III.,"disposal. Instead of republishing the text, I content myself with"
301,III.,giving a full list of corrections in the appendix to this volume
302,III.,"which will enable scholars to control our readings, and which will,"
303,III.,"I believe, justify the translation in the numerous passages in which"
304,III.,it deviates from Dr. Langdon's rendering. While credit should be given
305,III.,"to Dr. Langdon for having made this important tablet accessible, the"
306,III.,interests of science demand that attention be called to his failure to
307,III.,"grasp the many important data furnished by the tablet, which escaped"
308,III.,him because of his erroneous readings and faulty translations.
309,III.,
310,III.,"The tablet, consisting of six columns (three on the obverse and three"
311,III.,"on the reverse), comprised, according to the colophon, 240 lines"
312,III.,"[25] and formed the second tablet of the series. Of the total, 204"
313,III.,"lines are preserved in full or in part, and of the missing thirty-six"
314,III.,"quite a number can be restored, so that we have a fairly complete"
315,III.,"tablet. The most serious break occurs at the top of the reverse, where"
316,III.,about eight lines are missing. In consequence of this the connection
317,III.,between the end of the obverse (where about five lines are missing)
318,III.,"and the beginning of the reverse is obscured, though not to the extent"
319,III.,of our entirely losing the thread of the narrative.
320,III.,
321,III.,About the same time that the University of Pennsylvania Museum
322,III.,"purchased this second tablet of the Gilgamesh Series, Yale University"
323,III.,"obtained a tablet from the same dealer, which turned out to be a"
324,III.,continuation of the University of Pennsylvania tablet. That the two
325,III.,belong to the same edition of the Epic is shown by their agreement
326,III.,"in the dark brown color of the clay, in the writing as well as in"
327,III.,"the size of the tablet, though the characters on the Yale tablet"
328,III.,are somewhat cramped and in consequence more difficult to read. Both
329,III.,"tablets consist of six columns, three on the obverse and three on the"
330,III.,"reverse. The measurements of both are about the same, the Pennsylvania"
331,III.,"tablet being estimated at about 7 inches high, as against 7 2/16 inches"
332,III.,"for the Yale tablet, while the width of both is 6 1/2 inches. The"
333,III.,"Yale tablet is, however, more closely written and therefore has a"
334,III.,larger number of lines than the Pennsylvania tablet. The colophon to
335,III.,"the Yale tablet is unfortunately missing, but from internal evidence"
336,III.,it is quite certain that the Yale tablet follows immediately upon
337,III.,"the Pennsylvania tablet and, therefore, may be set down as the third"
338,III.,"of the series. The obverse is very badly preserved, so that only a"
339,III.,general view of its contents can be secured. The reverse contains
340,III.,serious gaps in the first and second columns. The scribe evidently
341,III.,"had a copy before him which he tried to follow exactly, but finding"
342,III.,"that he could not get all of the copy before him in the six columns,"
343,III.,he continued the last column on the edge. In this way we obtain for the
344,III.,"sixth column 64 lines as against 45 for column IV, and 47 for column V,"
345,III.,and a total of 292 lines for the six columns. Subtracting the 16 lines
346,III.,written on the edge leaves us 276 lines for our tablet as against 240
347,III.,for its companion. The width of each column being the same on both
348,III.,"tablets, the difference of 36 lines is made up by the closer writing."
349,III.,
350,III.,"Both tablets have peculiar knobs at the sides, the purpose of which"
351,III.,is evidently not to facilitate holding the tablet in one's hand while
352,III.,"writing or reading it, as Langdon assumed [26] (it would be quite"
353,III.,"impracticable for this purpose), but simply to protect the tablet in"
354,III.,"its position on a shelf, where it would naturally be placed on the"
355,III.,"edge, just as we arrange books on a shelf. Finally be it noted that"
356,III.,these two tablets of the old Babylonian version do not belong to the
357,III.,"same edition as the Meissner tablet above described, for the latter"
358,III.,"consists of two columns each on obverse and reverse, as against"
359,III.,three columns each in the case of our two tablets. We thus have
360,III.,the interesting proof that as early as 2000 B.C. there were already
361,III.,"several editions of the Epic. As to the provenance of our two tablets,"
362,III.,"there are no definite data, but it is likely that they were found by"
363,III.,"natives in the mounds at Warka, from which about the year 1913, many"
364,III.,tablets came into the hands of dealers. It is likely that where two
365,III.,"tablets of a series were found, others of the series were also dug up,"
366,III.,and we may expect to find some further portions of this old Babylonian
367,III.,version turning up in the hands of other dealers or in museums.

372,IV.,
373,IV.,
374,IV.,"Coming to the contents of the two tablets, the Pennsylvania tablet"
375,IV.,"deals with the meeting of the two heroes, Gilgamesh and Enkidu,"
376,IV.,"their conflict, followed by their reconciliation, while the Yale"
377,IV.,tablet in continuation takes up the preparations for the encounter of
378,IV.,"the two heroes with the guardian of the cedar forest, Humbaba--but"
379,IV.,"probably pronounced Hubaba [27]--or, as the name appears in the old"
380,IV.,"Babylonian version, Huwawa. The two tablets correspond, therefore,"
381,IV.,"to portions of Tablets I to V of the Assyrian version; [28] but,"
382,IV.,"as will be shown in detail further on, the number of _completely_"
383,IV.,"parallel passages is not large, and the Assyrian version shows an"
384,IV.,independence of the old Babylonian version that is larger than we
385,IV.,"had reason to expect. In general, it may be said that the Assyrian"
386,IV.,"version is more elaborate, which points to its having received its"
387,IV.,present form at a considerably later period than the old Babylonian
388,IV.,"version. [29] On the other hand, we already find in the Babylonian"
389,IV.,"version the tendency towards repetition, which is characteristic"
390,IV.,of Babylonian-Assyrian tales in general. Through the two Babylonian
391,IV.,tablets we are enabled to fill out certain details of the two episodes
392,IV.,"with which they deal: (1) the meeting of Gilgamesh and Enkidu, and"
393,IV.,(2) the encounter with Huwawa; while their greatest value consists
394,IV.,in the light that they throw on the gradual growth of the Epic until
395,IV.,it reached its definite form in the text represented by the fragments
396,IV.,"in Ashurbanapal's Library. Let us now take up the detailed analysis,"
397,IV.,first of the Pennsylvania tablet and then of the Yale tablet. The
398,IV.,Pennsylvania tablet begins with two dreams recounted by Gilgamesh
399,IV.,"to his mother, which the latter interprets as presaging the coming"
400,IV.,"of Enkidu to Erech. In the one, something like a heavy meteor falls"
401,IV.,from heaven upon Gilgamesh and almost crushes him. With the help of
402,IV.,"the heroes of Erech, Gilgamesh carries the heavy burden to his mother"
403,IV.,"Ninsun. The burden, his mother explains, symbolizes some one who,"
404,IV.,"like Gilgamesh, is born in the mountains, to whom all will pay homage"
405,IV.,and of whom Gilgamesh will become enamoured with a love as strong as
406,IV.,"that for a woman. In a second dream, Gilgamesh sees some one who is"
407,IV.,"like him, who brandishes an axe, and with whom he falls in love. This"
408,IV.,"personage, the mother explains, is again Enkidu."
409,IV.,
410,IV.,Langdon is of the opinion that these dreams are recounted to
411,IV.,Enkidu by a woman with whom Enkidu cohabits for six days and seven
412,IV.,"nights and who weans Enkidu from association with animals. This,"
413,IV.,"however, cannot be correct. The scene between Enkidu and the woman"
414,IV.,"must have been recounted in detail in the first tablet, as in the"
415,IV.,"Assyrian version, [30] whereas here in the second tablet we have the"
416,IV.,continuation of the tale with Gilgamesh recounting his dreams directly
417,IV.,to his mother. The story then continues with the description of the
418,IV.,"coming of Enkidu, conducted by the woman to the outskirts of Erech,"
419,IV.,where food is given him. The main feature of the incident is the
420,IV.,"conversion of Enkidu to civilized life. Enkidu, who hitherto had"
421,IV.,"gone about naked, is clothed by the woman. Instead of sucking milk"
422,IV.,"and drinking from a trough like an animal, food and strong drink are"
423,IV.,"placed before him, and he is taught how to eat and drink in human"
424,IV.,"fashion. In human fashion he also becomes drunk, and his ""spree"" is"
425,IV.,"naïvely described: ""His heart became glad and his face shone."" [31]"
426,IV.,"Like an animal, Enkidu's body had hitherto been covered with hair,"
427,IV.,"which is now shaved off. He is anointed with oil, and clothed ""like"
428,IV.,"a man."" Enkidu becomes a shepherd, protecting the fold against wild"
429,IV.,"beasts, and his exploit in dispatching lions is briefly told. At this"
430,IV.,"point--the end of column 3 (on the obverse), i.e., line 117, and the"
431,IV.,"beginning of column 4 (on the reverse), i.e., line 131--a gap of 13"
432,IV.,"lines--the tablet is obscure, but apparently the story of Enkidu's"
433,IV.,"gradual transformation from savagery to civilized life is continued,"
434,IV.,with stress upon his introduction to domestic ways with the wife
435,IV.,"chosen or decreed for him, and with work as part of his fate. All"
436,IV.,"this has no connection with Gilgamesh, and it is evident that the"
437,IV.,tale of Enkidu was originally an _independent_ tale to illustrate the
438,IV.,"evolution of man's career and destiny, how through intercourse with"
439,IV.,"a woman he awakens to the sense of human dignity, how he becomes"
440,IV.,"accustomed to the ways of civilization, how he passes through the"
441,IV.,"pastoral stage to higher walks of life, how the family is instituted,"
442,IV.,and how men come to be engaged in the labors associated with human
443,IV.,"activities. In order to connect this tale with the Gilgamesh story,"
444,IV.,"the two heroes are brought together; the woman taking on herself,"
445,IV.,"in addition to the rôle of civilizer, that of the medium through"
446,IV.,which Enkidu is brought to Gilgamesh. The woman leads Enkidu from
447,IV.,"the outskirts of Erech into the city itself, where the people on"
448,IV.,seeing him remark upon his likeness to Gilgamesh. He is the very
449,IV.,"counterpart of the latter, though somewhat smaller in stature. There"
450,IV.,"follows the encounter between the two heroes in the streets of Erech,"
451,IV.,where they engage in a fierce combat. Gilgamesh is overcome by Enkidu
452,IV.,and is enraged at being thrown to the ground. The tablet closes with
453,IV.,the endeavor of Enkidu to pacify Gilgamesh. Enkidu declares that the
454,IV.,"mother of Gilgamesh has exalted her son above the ordinary mortal,"
455,IV.,and that Enlil himself has singled him out for royal prerogatives.
456,IV.,
457,IV.,"After this, we may assume, the two heroes become friends and together"
458,IV.,"proceed to carry out certain exploits, the first of which is an attack"
459,IV.,upon the mighty guardian of the cedar forest. This is the main episode
460,IV.,"in the Yale tablet, which, therefore, forms the third tablet of the"
461,IV.,old Babylonian version.
462,IV.,
463,IV.,"In the first column of the obverse of the Yale tablet, which is badly"
464,IV.,"preserved, it would appear that the elders of Erech (or perhaps the"
465,IV.,people) are endeavoring to dissuade Gilgamesh from making the attempt
466,IV.,"to penetrate to the abode of Huwawa. If this is correct, then the"
467,IV.,close of the first column may represent a conversation between these
468,IV.,elders and the woman who accompanies Enkidu. It would be the elders
469,IV.,"who are represented as ""reporting the speech to the woman,"" which is"
470,IV.,presumably the determination of Gilgamesh to fight Huwawa. The elders
471,IV.,apparently desire Enkidu to accompany Gilgamesh in this perilous
472,IV.,"adventure, and with this in view appeal to the woman. In the second"
473,IV.,column after an obscure reference to the mother of Gilgamesh--perhaps
474,IV.,appealing to the sun-god--we find Gilgamesh and Enkidu again face to
475,IV.,"face. From the reference to Enkidu's eyes ""filled with tears,"" we may"
476,IV.,conclude that he is moved to pity at the thought of what will happen to
477,IV.,"Gilgamesh if he insists upon carrying out his purpose. Enkidu, also,"
478,IV.,tries to dissuade Gilgamesh. This appears to be the main purport of
479,IV.,"the dialogue between the two, which begins about the middle of the"
480,IV.,second column and extends to the end of the third column. Enkidu
481,IV.,"pleads that even his strength is insufficient,"
482,IV.,
483,IV.,
484,IV.,"""My arms are lame,"
485,IV.,"My strength has become weak."" (lines 88-89)"
486,IV.,
487,IV.,
488,IV.,Gilgamesh apparently asks for a description of the terrible tyrant
489,IV.,"who thus arouses the fear of Enkidu, and in reply Enkidu tells"
490,IV.,"him how at one time, when he was roaming about with the cattle, he"
491,IV.,penetrated into the forest and heard the roar of Huwawa which was
492,IV.,"like that of a deluge. The mouth of the tyrant emitted fire, and his"
493,IV.,"breath was death. It is clear, as Professor Haupt has suggested, [32]"
494,IV.,"that Enkidu furnishes the description of a volcano in eruption, with"
495,IV.,"its mighty roar, spitting forth fire and belching out a suffocating"
496,IV.,"smoke. Gilgamesh is, however, undaunted and urges Enkidu to accompany"
497,IV.,him in the adventure.
498,IV.,
499,IV.,"""I will go down to the forest,"" says Gilgamesh, if the conjectural"
500,IV.,restoration of the line in question (l. 126) is correct. Enkidu replies
501,IV.,"by again drawing a lurid picture of what will happen ""When we go"
502,IV.,"(together) to the forest......."" This speech of Enkidu is continued on"
503,IV.,the reverse. In reply Gilgamesh emphasizes his reliance upon the good
504,IV.,will of Shamash and reproaches Enkidu with cowardice. He declares
505,IV.,"himself superior to Enkidu's warning, and in bold terms says that"
506,IV.,he prefers to perish in the attempt to overcome Huwawa rather than
507,IV.,abandon it.
508,IV.,
509,IV.,
510,IV.,"""Wherever terror is to be faced,"
511,IV.,"Thou, forsooth, art in fear of death."
512,IV.,Thy prowess lacks strength.
513,IV.,"I will go before thee,"
514,IV.,"Though thy mouth shouts to me: 'thou art afraid to approach,'"
515,IV.,"If I fall, I will establish my name."" (lines 143-148)"
516,IV.,
517,IV.,
518,IV.,There follows an interesting description of the forging of the
519,IV.,weapons for the two heroes in preparation for the encounter. [33]
520,IV.,The elders of Erech when they see these preparations are stricken
521,IV.,with fear. They learn of Huwawa's threat to annihilate Gilgamesh if
522,IV.,"he dares to enter the cedar forest, and once more try to dissuade"
523,IV.,Gilgamesh from the undertaking.
524,IV.,
525,IV.,
526,IV.,"""Thou art young, O Gish, and thy heart carries thee away,"
527,IV.,"Thou dost not know what thou proposest to do."" (lines 190-191)"
528,IV.,
529,IV.,
530,IV.,They try to frighten Gilgamesh by repeating the description of
531,IV.,the terrible Huwawa. Gilgamesh is still undaunted and prays to his
532,IV.,"patron deity Shamash, who apparently accords him a favorable ""oracle"""
533,IV.,"(_têrtu_). The two heroes arm themselves for the fray, and the elders"
534,IV.,"of Erech, now reconciled to the perilous undertaking, counsel Gilgamesh"
535,IV.,to take provision along for the undertaking. They urge Gilgamesh to
536,IV.,"allow Enkidu to take the lead, for"
537,IV.,
538,IV.,
539,IV.,"""He is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road"
540,IV.,"[to] the entrance of the forest."" (lines 252-253)"
541,IV.,
542,IV.,
543,IV.,The elders dismiss Gilgamesh with fervent wishes that Enkidu may track
544,IV.,"out the ""closed path"" for Gilgamesh, and commit him to the care of"
545,IV.,Lugalbanda--here perhaps an epithet of Shamash. They advise Gilgamesh
546,IV.,"to perform certain rites, to wash his feet in the stream of Huwawa and"
547,IV.,to pour out a libation of water to Shamash. Enkidu follows in a speech
548,IV.,likewise intended to encourage the hero; and with the actual beginning
549,IV.,"of the expedition against Huwawa the tablet ends. The encounter itself,"
550,IV.,"with the triumph of the two heroes, must have been described in the"
551,IV.,fourth tablet.
552,IV.,
553,IV.,
554,IV.,
555,V.,V.
556,V.,
557,V.,
558,V.,Now before taking up the significance of the additions to our
559,V.,"knowledge of the Epic gained through these two tablets, it will be"
560,V.,well to discuss the forms in which the names of the two heroes and
561,V.,of the ruler of the cedar forest occur in our tablets.
562,V.,
563,V.,"As in the Meissner fragment, the chief hero is invariably designated"
564,V.,as dGish in both the Pennsylvania and Yale tablets; and we may
565,V.,therefore conclude that this was the common form in the Hammurabi
566,V.,"period, as against the writing dGish-gì(n)-mash [34] in the Assyrian"
567,V.,"version. Similarly, as in the Meissner fragment, the second hero's"
568,V.,name is always written En-ki-du [35] (abbreviated from dúg) as
569,V.,"against En-ki-dú in the Assyrian version. Finally, we encounter in"
570,V.,the Yale tablet for the first time the writing Hu-wa-wa as the name
571,V.,"of the guardian of the cedar forest, as against Hum-ba-ba in the"
572,V.,"Assyrian version, though in the latter case, as we may now conclude"
573,V.,"from the Yale tablet, the name should rather be read Hu-ba-ba. [36]"
574,V.,The variation in the writing of the latter name is interesting
575,V.,as pointing to the aspirate pronunciation of the labial in both
576,V.,instances. The name would thus present a complete parallel to the
577,V.,Hebrew name Howawa (or Hobab) who appears as the brother-in-law
578,V.,"of Moses in the P document, Numbers 10, 29. [37] Since the name"
579,V.,"also occurs, written precisely as in the Yale tablet, among the"
580,V.,"""Amoritic"" names in the important lists published by Dr. Chiera,"
581,V.,[38] there can be no doubt that Huwawa or Hubaba is a West Semitic
582,V.,"name. This important fact adds to the probability that the ""cedar"
583,V.,"forest"" in which Huwawa dwells is none other than the Lebanon district,"
584,V.,famed since early antiquity for its cedars. This explanation of the
585,V.,name Huwawa disposes of suppositions hitherto brought forward for an
586,V.,"Elamitic origin. Gressmann [39] still favors such an origin, though"
587,V.,realizing that the description of the cedar forest points to the Amanus
588,V.,or Lebanon range. In further confirmation of the West Semitic origin of
589,V.,"the name, we have in Lucian, _De Dea Syria_, § 19, the name Kombabos"
590,V.,"[40] (the guardian of Stratonika), which forms a perfect parallel to"
591,V.,Hu(m)baba. Of the important bearings of this western character of the
592,V.,"name Huwawa on the interpretation and origin of the Gilgamesh Epic,"
593,V.,suggesting that the episode of the encounter between the tyrant and
594,V.,the two heroes rests upon a tradition of an expedition against the
595,V.,"West or Amurru land, we shall have more to say further on."
596,V.,
597,V.,The variation in the writing of the name Enkidu is likewise
598,V.,interesting. It is evident that the form in the old Babylonian
599,V.,"version with the sign du (i.e., dúg) is the original, for it furnishes"
600,V.,"us with a suitable etymology ""Enki is good."" The writing with dúg,"
601,V.,"pronounced du, also shows that the sign dú as the third element in the"
602,V.,"form which the name has in the Assyrian version is to be read dú, and"
603,V.,that former readings like Ea-bani must be definitely abandoned. [41]
604,V.,"The form with dú is clearly a _phonetic_ writing of the Sumerian name,"
605,V.,the sign dú being chosen to indicate the _pronunciation_ (not the
606,V.,ideograph) of the third element dúg. This is confirmed by the writing
607,V.,"En-gi-dú in the syllabary _CT_ XVIII, 30, 10. The phonetic writing"
608,V.,"is, therefore, a warning against any endeavor to read the name by"
609,V.,an Akkadian transliteration of the signs. This would not of itself
610,V.,"prove that Enkidu is of Sumerian _origin_, for it might well be that"
611,V.,the writing En-ki-dú is an endeavor to give a Sumerian _aspect_ to
612,V.,a name that _may_ have been foreign. The element dúg corresponds to
613,V.,"the Semitic _tâbu_, ""good,"" and En-ki being originally a designation"
614,V.,"of a deity as the ""lord of the land,"" which would be the Sumerian"
615,V.,"manner of indicating a Semitic Baal, it is not at all impossible"
616,V.,"that En-ki-dúg may be the ""Sumerianized"" form of a Semitic BA`L TZOB"
617,V.,"""Baal is good."" It will be recalled that in the third column of the"
618,V.,"Yale tablet, Enkidu speaks of himself in his earlier period while"
619,V.,"still living with cattle, as wandering into the cedar forest of"
620,V.,"Huwawa, while in another passage (ll. 252-253) he is described as"
621,V.,"""acquainted with the way ... to the entrance of the forest."" This"
622,V.,would clearly point to the West as the original home of Enkidu. We
623,V.,are thus led once more to Amurru--taken as a general designation of
624,V.,the West--as playing an important role in the Gilgamesh Epic. [42] If
625,V.,Gilgamesh's expedition against Huwawa of the Lebanon district recalls
626,V.,"a Babylonian campaign against Amurru, Enkidu's coming from his home,"
627,V.,"where, as we read repeatedly in the Assyrian version,"
628,V.,
629,V.,
630,V.,"""He ate herbs with the gazelles,"
631,V.,"Drank out of a trough with cattle,"" [43]"
632,V.,
633,V.,
634,V.,may rest on a tradition of an Amorite invasion of Babylonia. The
635,V.,"fight between Gilgamesh and Enkidu would fit in with this tradition,"
636,V.,while the subsequent reconciliation would be the form in which the
637,V.,tradition would represent the enforced union between the invaders
638,V.,and the older settlers.
639,V.,
640,V.,"Leaving this aside for the present, let us proceed to a consideration"
641,V.,"of the relationship of the form dGish, for the chief personage"
642,V.,"in the Epic in the old Babylonian version, to dGish-gi(n)-mash in"
643,V.,the Assyrian version. Of the meaning of Gish there is fortunately
644,V.,"no doubt. It is clearly the equivalent to the Akkadian _zikaru_,"
645,V.,"""man"" (Brünnow No. 5707), or possibly _rabû_, ""great"" (Brünnow"
646,V.,"No. 5704). Among various equivalents, the preference is to be given"
647,V.,"to _itlu_, ""hero."" The determinative for deity stamps the person so"
648,V.,"designated as deified, or as in part divine, and this is in accord"
649,V.,with the express statement in the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh
650,V.,Epic which describes the hero as
651,V.,
652,V.,
653,V.,"""Two-thirds god and one-third human."" [44]"
654,V.,
655,V.,
656,V.,"Gish is, therefore, the hero-god _par excellence_; and this shows"
657,V.,"that we are not dealing with a genuine proper name, but rather with a"
658,V.,"descriptive attribute. Proper names are not formed in this way, either"
659,V.,in Sumerian or Akkadian. Now what relation does this form Gish bear to
660,V.,
661,V.,
662,[FIGURE],[FIGURE]
663,[FIGURE],
664,[FIGURE],
665,[FIGURE],"as the name of the hero is invariably written in the Assyrian version,"
666,[FIGURE],the form which was at first read dIz-tu-bar or dGish-du-bar by
667,[FIGURE],"scholars, until Pinches found in a neo-Babylonian syllabary [45]"
668,[FIGURE],the equation of it with Gi-il-ga-mesh? Pinches' discovery pointed
669,[FIGURE],conclusively to the popular pronunciation of the hero's name as
670,[FIGURE],"Gilgamesh; and since Aelian (_De natura Animalium_ XII, 2) mentions"
671,[FIGURE],a Babylonian personage Gilgamos (though what he tells us of Gilgamos
672,[FIGURE],"does not appear in our Epic, but seems to apply to Etana, another"
673,[FIGURE],"figure of Babylonian mythology), there seemed to be no further reason"
674,[FIGURE],"to question that the problem had been solved. Besides, in a later"
675,[FIGURE],Syriac list of Babylonian kings found in the Scholia of Theodor bar
676,[FIGURE],"Koni, the name GLMGVM with a variant GMYGMVS occurs, [46] and it"
677,[FIGURE],"is evident that we have here again the Gi-il-ga-mesh, discovered by"
678,[FIGURE],Pinches. The existence of an old Babylonian hero Gilgamesh who was
679,[FIGURE],"likewise a king is thus established, as well as his identification with"
680,[FIGURE],
681,[FIGURE],
682,[FIGURE],[FIGURE]
683,[FIGURE],
684,[FIGURE],
685,[FIGURE],It is evident that we cannot read this name as Iz-tu-bar or
686,[FIGURE],"Gish-du-bar, but that we must read the first sign as Gish and the"
687,[FIGURE],"third as Mash, while for the second we must assume a reading Gìn or"
688,[FIGURE],Gi. This would give us Gish-gì(n)-mash which is clearly again (like
689,[FIGURE],"En-ki-dú) not an etymological writing but a _phonetic_ one, intended"
690,[FIGURE],to convey an _approach_ to the popular pronunciation. Gi-il-ga-mesh
691,[FIGURE],"might well be merely a variant for Gish-ga-mesh, or _vice versa_,"
692,[FIGURE],"and this would come close to Gish-gi-mash. Now, when we have a name"
693,[FIGURE],"the pronunciation of which is not definite but approximate, and which"
694,[FIGURE],"is written in various ways, the probabilities are that the name is"
695,[FIGURE],foreign. A foreign name might naturally be spelled in various ways. The
696,[FIGURE],Epic in the Assyrian version clearly depicts dGish-gì(n)-mash as a
697,[FIGURE],"conqueror of Erech, who forces the people into subjection, and whose"
698,[FIGURE],autocratic rule leads the people of Erech to implore the goddess
699,[FIGURE],Aruru to create a rival to him who may withstand him. In response
700,[FIGURE],to this appeal dEnkidu is formed out of dust by Aruru and eventually
701,[FIGURE],brought to Erech. [47] Gish-gì(n)-mash or Gilgamesh is therefore in
702,[FIGURE],all probability a foreigner; and the simplest solution suggested by the
703,[FIGURE],existence of the two forms (1) Gish in the old Babylonian version and
704,[FIGURE],"(2) Gish-gì(n)-mash in the Assyrian version, is to regard the former"
705,[FIGURE],"as an abbreviation, which seemed appropriate, because the short name"
706,[FIGURE],"conveyed the idea of the ""hero"" _par excellence_. If Gish-gì(n)-mash"
707,[FIGURE],"is a foreign name, one would think in the first instance of Sumerian;"
708,[FIGURE],but here we encounter a difficulty in the circumstance that outside of
709,[FIGURE],the Epic this conqueror and ruler of Erech appears in quite a different
710,[FIGURE],"form, namely, as dGish-bil-ga-mesh, with dGish-gibil(or bìl)-ga-mesh"
711,[FIGURE],and dGish-bil-ge-mesh as variants. [48] In the remarkable list of
712,[FIGURE],"partly mythological and partly historical dynasties, published by"
713,[FIGURE],"Poebel, [49] the fifth member of the first dynasty of Erech appears"
714,[FIGURE],as dGish-bil-ga-mesh; and similarly in an inscription of the days of
715,[FIGURE],"Sin-gamil, dGish-bil-ga-mesh is mentioned as the builder of the wall"
716,[FIGURE],"of Erech. [50] Moreover, in the several fragments of the Sumerian"
717,[FIGURE],version of the Epic we have invariably the form dGish-bil-ga-mesh. It
718,[FIGURE],"is evident, therefore, that this is the genuine form of the name in"
719,[FIGURE],"Sumerian and presumably, therefore, the oldest form. By way of further"
720,[FIGURE],"confirmation we have in the syllabary above referred to, CT, XVIII,"
721,[FIGURE],"30, 6-8, three designations of our hero, viz:"
722,[FIGURE],
723,[FIGURE],
724,[FIGURE],dGish-gibil(or bíl)-ga-mesh
725,[FIGURE],"_muk-tab-lu_ (""warrior"")"
726,[FIGURE],"_a-lik pa-na_ (""leader"")"
727,[FIGURE],
728,[FIGURE],
729,[FIGURE],All three designations are set down as the equivalent of the Sumerian
730,[FIGURE],"Esigga imin i.e., ""the seven-fold hero."""
731,[FIGURE],
732,[FIGURE],Of the same general character is the equation in another syllabary:
733,[FIGURE],[51]
734,[FIGURE],
735,[FIGURE],
736,[FIGURE],"Esigga-tuk and its equivalent Gish-tuk = ""the one who is"
737,[FIGURE],"a hero."""
738,[FIGURE],
739,[FIGURE],
740,[FIGURE],"Furthermore, the name occurs frequently in ""Temple"" documents of the Ur"
741,[FIGURE],dynasty in the form dGish-bil-ga-mesh [52] with dGish-bil-gi(n)-mesh
742,[FIGURE],"as a variant. [53] In a list of deities (_CT_ XXV, 28, K 7659)"
743,[FIGURE],"we likewise encounter dGish-gibil(or bíl)-ga-mesh, and lastly in a"
744,[FIGURE],syllabary we have the equation [54]
745,[FIGURE],
746,[FIGURE],
747,[FIGURE],dGish-gi-mas-[si?] = dGish-bil-[ga-mesh].
748,[FIGURE],
749,[FIGURE],
750,[FIGURE],"The variant Gish-gibil for Gish-bil may be disposed of readily, in view"
751,[FIGURE],of the frequent confusion or interchange of the two signs Bil (Brünnow
752,[FIGURE],No. 4566) and Gibil or Bíl (Brünnow No. 4642) which has also the value
753,[FIGURE],"Gi (Brünnow 4641), so that we might also read Gish-gi-ga-mesh. Both"
754,[FIGURE],"signs convey the idea of ""fire,"" ""renew,"" etc.; both revert to the"
755,[FIGURE],"picture of flames of fire, in the one case with a bowl (or some"
756,[FIGURE],"such obiect) above it, in the other the flames issuing apparently"
757,[FIGURE],from a torch. [55] The meaning of the name is not affected whether
758,[FIGURE],"we read dGish-bil-ga-mesh or dGish-gibil(or bíl)-ga-mesh, for the"
759,[FIGURE],"middle element in the latter case being identical with the fire-god,"
760,[FIGURE],written dBil-gi and to be pronounced in the inverted form as Gibil
761,[FIGURE],"with _-ga_ (or _ge_) as the phonetic complement; it is equivalent,"
762,[FIGURE],"therefore, to the writing bil-ga in the former case. Now Gish-gibil"
763,[FIGURE],"or Gish-bíl conveys the idea of _abu_, ""father"" (Brünnow No. 5713),"
764,[FIGURE],"just as Bil (Brünnow No. 4579) has this meaning, while Pa-gibil-(ga)"
765,[FIGURE],"or Pa-bíl-ga is _abu abi_, ""grandfather."" [56] This meaning may be"
766,[FIGURE],"derived from Gibil, as also from Bíl = _isatu_, ""fire,"" then _essu_,"
767,[FIGURE],"""new,"" then _abu_, ""father,"" as the renewer or creator. Gish with Bíl"
768,[FIGURE],"or Gibil would, therefore, be ""the father-man"" or ""the father-hero,"""
769,[FIGURE],"i.e., again the hero _par excellence_, the original hero, just as in"
770,[FIGURE],Hebrew and Arabic _ab_ is used in this way. [57] The syllable _ga
771,[FIGURE],"_being a phonetic complement, the element _mesh_ is to be taken"
772,[FIGURE],"by itself and to be explained, as Poebel suggested, as ""hero"""
773,[FIGURE],(_itlu_. Brünnow No. 5967).
774,[FIGURE],
775,[FIGURE],"We would thus obtain an entirely artificial combination, ""man (or"
776,[FIGURE],"hero), father, hero,"" which would simply convey in an emphatic manner"
777,[FIGURE],"the idea of the _Ur-held_, the original hero, the father of heroes as"
778,[FIGURE],"it were--practically the same idea, therefore, as the one conveyed"
779,[FIGURE],"by Gish alone, as the hero _par excellence_. Our investigation thus"
780,[FIGURE],leads us to a substantial identity between Gish and the longer form
781,[FIGURE],"Gish-bil(or bíl)-ga-mesh, and the former might, therefore, well be used"
782,[FIGURE],as an abbreviation of the latter. Both the shorter and the longer forms
783,[FIGURE],"are _descriptive epithets _based on naive folk etymology, rather than"
784,[FIGURE],"personal names, just as in the designation of our hero as  _muktablu_,"
785,[FIGURE],"the ""fighter,"" or as _âlik pâna_, ""the leader,"" or as _Esigga imin_,"
786,[FIGURE],"""the seven-fold hero,"" or _Esigga tuk_, ""the one who is a hero,"" are"
787,[FIGURE],"descriptive epithets, and as Atra-hasis, ""the very wise one,"" is such"
788,[FIGURE],an epithet for the hero of the deluge story. The case is different with
789,[FIGURE],"Gi-il-ga-mesh, or Gish-gì(n)-mash, which represent the popular and"
790,[FIGURE],"actual pronunciation of the name, or at least the _approach_ to such"
791,[FIGURE],"pronunciation. Such forms, stripped as they are of all artificiality,"
792,[FIGURE],impress one as genuine names. The conclusion to which we are thus led
793,[FIGURE],"is that Gish-bil(or bíl)-ga-mesh is a play upon the genuine name,"
794,[FIGURE],"to convey to those to whom the real name, as that of a foreigner,"
795,[FIGURE],would suggest no meaning an interpretation _fitting in with his
796,[FIGURE],"character_. In other words, Gish-bil-ga-mesh is a ""Sumerianized"""
797,[FIGURE],"form of the name, introduced into the Sumerian version of the tale"
798,[FIGURE],which became a folk-possession in the Euphrates Valley. Such plays
799,[FIGURE],upon names to suggest the character of an individual or some incident
800,[FIGURE],are familiar to us from the narratives in Genesis. [58] They do not
801,[FIGURE],constitute genuine etymologies and are rarely of use in leading to a
802,[FIGURE],"correct etymology. Reuben, e.g., certainly does not mean ""Yahweh has"
803,[FIGURE],"seen my affliction,"" which the mother is supposed to have exclaimed"
804,[FIGURE],"at the birth (Genesis 29, 32), with a play upon _ben_ and _be'onyi_,"
805,[FIGURE],"any more than Judah means ""I praise Yahweh"" (v. 35), though it does"
806,[FIGURE],contain the divine name (_Ye_hô) as an element. The play on the
807,[FIGURE],"name may be close or remote, as long as it fulfills its function of"
808,[FIGURE],_suggesting_ an etymology that is complimentary or appropriate.
809,[FIGURE],
810,[FIGURE],"In this way, an artificial division and at the same time a"
811,[FIGURE],"distortion of a foreign name like Gilgamesh into several elements,"
812,[FIGURE],"Gish-bil-ga-mesh, is no more violent than, for example, the explanation"
813,[FIGURE],"of Issachar or rather Issaschar as ""God has given my hire"" (Genesis"
814,[FIGURE],"30, 18) with a play upon the element _se_char, and as though the"
815,[FIGURE],"name were to be divided into _Yah_ (""God"") and _se_char (""hire"");"
816,[FIGURE],"or the popular name of Alexander among the Arabs as _Zu'l Karnaini_,"
817,[FIGURE],"""the possessor of the two horns."" with a suggestion of his conquest"
818,[FIGURE],"of two hemispheres, or what not. [59] The element Gil in Gilgamesh"
819,[FIGURE],"would be regarded as a contraction of Gish-bil or gi-bil, in order"
820,[FIGURE],"to furnish the meaning ""father-hero,"" or Gil might be looked upon"
821,[FIGURE],"as a variant for Gish, which would give us the ""phonetic"" form in"
822,[FIGURE],"the Assyrian version dGish-gi-mash, [60] as well as such a variant"
823,[FIGURE],"writing dGish-gi-mas-(si). Now a name like Gilgamesh, upon which we"
824,[FIGURE],"may definitely settle as coming closest to the genuine form, certainly"
825,[FIGURE],"impresses one as foreign, i.e., it is neither Sumerian nor Akkadian;"
826,[FIGURE],and we have already suggested that the circumstance that the hero of
827,[FIGURE],"the Epic is portrayed as a conqueror of Erech, and a rather ruthless"
828,[FIGURE],"one at that, points to a tradition of an invasion of the Euphrates"
829,[FIGURE],Valley as the background for the episode in the first tablet of the
830,[FIGURE],"series. Now it is significant that many of the names in the ""mythical"""
831,[FIGURE],"dynasties, as they appear in Poebel's list, [61] are likewise foreign,"
832,[FIGURE],"such as Mes-ki-in-ga-se-ir, son of the god Shamash (and the founder"
833,[FIGURE],"of the ""mythical"" dynasty of Erech of which dGish-bil-ga-mesh is"
834,[FIGURE],"the fifth member), [62] and En-me-ir-kár his son. In a still earlier"
835,[FIGURE],"""mythical"" dynasty, we encounter names like Ga-lu-mu-um, Zu-ga-gi-ib,"
836,[FIGURE],"Ar-pi, E-ta-na, [63] which are distinctly foreign, while such names as"
837,[FIGURE],"En-me(n)-nun-na and Bar-sal-nun-na strike one again as ""Sumerianized"""
838,[FIGURE],names rather than as genuine Sumerian formations. [64]
839,[FIGURE],
840,[FIGURE],"Some of these names, as Galumum, Arpi and Etana, are so Amoritic"
841,[FIGURE],"in appearance, that one may hazard the conjecture of their western"
842,[FIGURE],"origin. May Gilgamesh likewise belong to the Amurru [65] region, or"
843,[FIGURE],"does he represent a foreigner from the East in contrast to Enkidu,"
844,[FIGURE],"whose name, we have seen, may have been Baal-Tôb in the West, with"
845,[FIGURE],which region he is according to the Epic so familiar? It must be
846,[FIGURE],confessed that the second element _ga-mesh_ would fit in well with
847,[FIGURE],"a Semitic origin for the name, for the element impresses one as"
848,[FIGURE],"the participial form of a Semitic stem G-M-S, just as in the second"
849,[FIGURE],element of Meskin-gaser we have such a form. Gil might then be the
850,[FIGURE],"name of a West-Semitic deity. Such conjectures, however, can for the"
851,[FIGURE],"present not be substantiated, and we must content ourselves with the"
852,[FIGURE],"conclusion that Gilgamesh as the real name of the hero, or at least"
853,[FIGURE],"the form which comes closest to the real name, points to a foreign"
854,[FIGURE],"origin for the hero, and that such forms as dGish-bil-ga-mesh and"
855,[FIGURE],"dGish-bíl-gi-mesh and other variants are ""Sumerianized"" forms for which"
856,[FIGURE],an artificial etymology was brought forward to convey the idea of the
857,[FIGURE],"""original hero"" or the hero _par excellence_. By means of this ""play"""
858,[FIGURE],"on the name, which reverts to the compilers of the Sumerian version"
859,[FIGURE],"of the Epic, Gilgamesh was converted into a Sumerian figure, just as"
860,[FIGURE],the name Enkidu may have been introduced as a Sumerian translation
861,[FIGURE],of his Amoritic name. dGish at all events is an abbreviated form of
862,[FIGURE],"the ""Sumerianized"" name, introduced by the compilers of the earliest"
863,[FIGURE],"Akkadian version, which was produced naturally under the influence"
864,[FIGURE],"of the Sumerian version. Later, as the Epic continued to grow, a"
865,[FIGURE],"phonetic writing was introduced, dGish-gi-mash, which is in a measure"
866,[FIGURE],"a compromise between the genuine name and the ""Sumerianized"" form,"
867,[FIGURE],but at the same time an _approach_ to the real pronunciation.

871,VI.,VI.
872,VI.,
873,VI.,
874,VI.,Next to the new light thrown upon the names and original character
875,VI.,"of the two main figures of the Epic, one of the chief points of"
876,VI.,interest in the Pennsylvania fragment is the proof that it furnishes
877,VI.,"for a striking resemblance of the two heroes, Gish and Enkidu, to one"
878,VI.,"another. In interpreting the dream of Gish, his mother. Ninsun, lays"
879,VI.,stress upon the fact that the dream portends the coming of someone
880,VI.,"who is like Gish, ""born in the field and reared in the mountain"""
881,VI.,"(lines 18-19). Both, therefore, are shown by this description to"
882,VI.,"have come to Babylonia from a mountainous region, i.e., they are"
883,VI.,foreigners; and in the case of Enkidu we have seen that the mountain
884,VI.,"in all probability refers to a region in the West, while the same may"
885,VI.,also be the case with Gish. The resemblance of the two heroes to one
886,VI.,another extends to their personal appearance. When Enkidu appears on
887,VI.,"the streets of Erech, the people are struck by this resemblance. They"
888,VI.,"remark that he is ""like Gish,"" though ""shorter in stature"" (lines"
889,VI.,179-180). Enkidu is described as a rival or counterpart. [66]
890,VI.,
891,VI.,This relationship between the two is suggested also by the Assyrian
892,VI.,"version. In the creation of Enkidu by Aruru, the people urge the"
893,VI.,"goddess to create the ""counterpart"" (_zikru_) of Gilgamesh, someone who"
894,VI.,"will be like him (_ma-si-il_) (Tablet I, 2, 31). Enkidu not only comes"
895,VI.,"from the mountain, [67] but the mountain is specifically designated as"
896,VI.,"his birth-place (I, 4, 2), precisely as in the Pennsylvania tablet,"
897,VI.,"while in another passage he is also described, as in our tablet, as"
898,VI.,"""born in the field."" [68] Still more significant is the designation of"
899,VI.,"Gilgamesh as the _talimu_, ""younger brother,"" of Enkidu. [69] In accord"
900,VI.,"with this, we find Gilgamesh in his lament over Enkidu describing"
901,VI.,"him as a ""younger brother"" (_ku-ta-ni_); [70] and again in the last"
902,VI.,"tablet of the Epic, Gilgamesh is referred to as the ""brother"" of"
903,VI.,"Enkidu. [71] This close relationship reverts to the Sumerian version,"
904,VI.,"for the Constantinople fragment (Langdon, above, p. 13) begins with the"
905,VI.,"designation of Gish-bil-ga-mesh as ""his brother."" By ""his"" no doubt"
906,VI.,Enkidu is meant. Likewise in the Sumerian text published by Zimmern
907,VI.,"(above, p. 13) Gilgamesh appears as the brother of Enkidu (rev. 1, 17)."
908,VI.,
909,VI.,Turning to the numerous representations of Gilgamesh and Enkidu on
910,VI.,"Seal Cylinders, [72] we find this resemblance of the two heroes to each"
911,VI.,"other strikingly confirmed. Both are represented as bearded, with the"
912,VI.,"strands arranged in the same fashion. The face in both cases is broad,"
913,VI.,"with curls protruding at the side of the head, though at times these"
914,VI.,curls are lacking in the case of Enkidu. What is particularly striking
915,VI.,"is to find Gilgamesh generally _a little taller_ than Enkidu, thus"
916,VI.,bearing out the statement in the Pennsylvania tablet that Enkidu is
917,VI.,"""shorter in stature."" There are, to be sure, also some distinguishing"
918,VI.,marks between the two. Thus Enkidu is generally represented with
919,VI.,"animal hoofs, but not always. [73] Enkidu is commonly portrayed with"
920,VI.,"the horns of a bison, but again this sign is wanting in quite a number"
921,VI.,of instances. [74] The hoofs and the horns mark the period when Enkidu
922,VI.,"lived with animals and much like an animal. Most remarkable, however,"
923,VI.,of all are cylinders on which we find the two heroes almost exactly
924,VI.,"alike as, for example, Ward No. 199 where two figures, the one a"
925,VI.,"duplicate of the other (except that one is just a shade taller), are in"
926,VI.,conflict with each other. Dr. Ward was puzzled by this representation
927,VI.,"and sets it down as a ""fantastic"" scene in which ""each Gilgamesh"
928,VI.,"is stabbing the other."" In the light of the Pennsylvania tablet,"
929,VI.,this scene is clearly the conflict between the two heroes described
930,VI.,"in column 6, preliminary to their forming a friendship. Even in the"
931,VI.,realm of myth the human experience holds good that there is nothing
932,VI.,like a good fight as a basis for a subsequent alliance. The fragment
933,VI.,"describes this conflict as a furious one in which Gilgamesh is worsted,"
934,VI.,"and his wounded pride assuaged by the generous victor, who comforts his"
935,VI.,vanquished enemy by the assurance that he was destined for something
936,VI.,"higher than to be a mere ""Hercules."" He was singled out for the"
937,VI.,exercise of royal authority. True to the description of the two heroes
938,VI.,"in the Pennsylvania tablet as alike, one the counterpart of the other,"
939,VI.,"the seal cylinder portrays them almost exactly alike, as alike as two"
940,VI.,brothers could possibly be; with just enough distinction to make it
941,VI.,clear on close inspection that two figures are intended and not one
942,VI.,repeated for the sake of symmetry. There are slight variations in the
943,VI.,"manner in which the hair is worn, and slightly varying expressions"
944,VI.,"of the face, just enough to make it evident that the one is intended"
945,VI.,"for Gilgamesh and the other for Enkidu. When, therefore, in another"
946,VI.,"specimen, No. 173, we find a Gilgamesh holding his counterpart by the"
947,VI.,"legs, it is merely another aspect of the fight between the two heroes,"
948,VI.,"one of whom is intended to represent Enkidu, and not, as Dr. Ward"
949,VI.,"supposed, a grotesque repetition of Gilgamesh. [75]"
950,VI.,
951,VI.,The description of Enkidu in the Pennsylvania tablet as a parallel
952,VI.,figure to Gilgamesh leads us to a consideration of the relationship
953,VI.,of the two figures to one another. Many years ago it was pointed
954,VI.,out that the Gilgamesh Epic was a composite tale in which various
955,VI.,stories of an independent origin had been combined and brought into
956,VI.,more or less artificial connection with the _heros eponymos_ of
957,VI.,southern Babylonia. [76] We may now go a step further and point out
958,VI.,"that not only is Enkidu originally an entirely independent figure,"
959,VI.,"having no connection with Gish or Gilgamesh, but that the latter is"
960,VI.,"really depicted in the Epic as the counterpart of Enkidu, a reflection"
961,VI.,who has been given the traits of extraordinary physical power that
962,VI.,belong to Enkidu. This is shown in the first place by the fact that
963,VI.,in the encounter it is Enkidu who triumphs over Gilgamesh. The entire
964,VI.,analysis of the episode of the meeting between the two heroes as given
965,VI.,by Gressmann [77] must be revised. It is not Enkidu who is terrified
966,VI.,"and who is warned against the encounter. It is Gilgamesh who, during"
967,VI.,the night on his way from the house in which the goddess Ishhara
968,VI.,"lies, encounters Enkidu on the highway. Enkidu ""blocks the path"""
969,VI.,"[78] of Gilgamesh. He prevents Gilgamesh from re-entering the house,"
970,VI.,"[79] and the two attack each other ""like oxen."" [80] They grapple"
971,VI.,"with each other, and Enkidu forces Gilgamesh to the ground. Enkidu"
972,VI.,"is, therefore, the real hero whose traits of physical prowess are"
973,VI.,afterwards transferred to Gilgamesh.
974,VI.,
975,VI.,"Similarly in the next episode, the struggle against Huwawa, the Yale"
976,VI.,tablet makes it clear that in the original form of the tale Enkidu
977,VI.,is the real hero. All warn Gish against the undertaking--the elders
978,VI.,"of Erech, Enkidu, and also the workmen. ""Why dost thou desire to do"
979,VI.,"this?"" [81] they say to him. ""Thou art young, and thy heart carries"
980,VI.,"thee away. Thou knowest not what thou proposest to do."" [82] This part"
981,VI.,of the incident is now better known to us through the latest fragment
982,VI.,of the Assyrian version discovered and published by King. [83] The
983,VI.,elders say to Gilgamesh:
984,VI.,
985,VI.,
986,VI.,"""Do not trust, O Gilgamesh, in thy strength!"
987,VI.,Be warned(?) against trusting to thy attack!
988,VI.,"The one who goes before will save his companion, [84]"
989,VI.,He who has foresight will save his friend. [85]
990,VI.,Let Enkidu go before thee.
991,VI.,He knows the roads to the cedar forest;
992,VI.,"He is skilled in battle and has seen fight."""
993,VI.,
994,VI.,
995,VI.,Gilgamesh is sufficiently impressed by this warning to invite Enkidu
996,VI.,"to accompany him on a visit to his mother, Ninsun, for the purpose"
997,VI.,of receiving her counsel. [86]
998,VI.,
999,VI.,"It is only after Enkidu, who himself hesitates and tries to dissuade"
1000,VI.,"Gish, decides to accompany the latter that the elders of Erech"
1001,VI.,are reconciled and encourage Gish for the fray. The two in concert
1002,VI.,proceed against Huwawa. Gilgamesh alone cannot carry out the plan. Now
1003,VI.,"when a tale thus associates two figures in one deed, one of the"
1004,VI.,two has been added to the original tale. In the present case there
1005,VI.,"can be little doubt that Enkidu, without whom Gish cannot proceed,"
1006,VI.,"who is specifically described as ""acquainted with the way ... to the"
1007,VI.,"entrance of the forest"" [87] in which Huwawa dwells is the _original_"
1008,VI.,"vanquisher. Naturally, the Epic aims to conceal this fact as much"
1009,VI.,as possible _ad majorem gloriam_ of Gilgamesh. It tries to put the
1010,VI.,"one who became the favorite hero into the foreground. Therefore, in"
1011,VI.,both the Babylonian and the Assyrian version Enkidu is represented
1012,VI.,"as hesitating, and Gilgamesh as determined to go ahead. Gilgamesh,"
1013,VI.,"in fact, accuses Enkidu of cowardice and boldly declares that he"
1014,VI.,will proceed even though failure stare him in the face. [88] Traces
1015,VI.,"of the older view, however, in which Gilgamesh is the one for whom"
1016,VI.,"one fears the outcome, crop out; as, for example, in the complaint of"
1017,VI.,Gilgamesh's mother to Shamash that the latter has stirred the heart
1018,VI.,"of her son to take the distant way to Hu(m)baba,"
1019,VI.,
1020,VI.,
1021,VI.,"""To a fight unknown to him, he advances,"
1022,VI.,"An expedition unknown to him he undertakes."" [89]"
1023,VI.,
1024,VI.,
1025,VI.,Ninsun evidently fears the consequences when her son informs her
1026,VI.,of his intention and asks her counsel. The answer of Shamash is not
1027,VI.,"preserved, but no doubt it was of a reassuring character, as was the"
1028,VI.,answer of the Sun-god to Gish's appeal and prayer as set forth in
1029,VI.,the Yale tablet. [90]
1030,VI.,
1031,VI.,"Again, as a further indication that Enkidu is the real conqueror of"
1032,VI.,"Huwawa, we find the coming contest revealed to Enkidu no less than"
1033,VI.,"three times in dreams, which Gilgamesh interprets. [91] Since the"
1034,VI.,"person who dreams is always the one to whom the dream applies, we may"
1035,VI.,see in these dreams a further trace of the primary rôle originally
1036,VI.,assigned to Enkidu.
1037,VI.,
1038,VI.,"Another exploit which, according to the Assyrian version, the two"
1039,VI.,"heroes perform in concert is the killing of a bull, sent by Anu at"
1040,VI.,the instance of Ishtar to avenge an insult offered to the goddess
1041,VI.,"by Gilgamesh, who rejects her offer of marriage. In the fragmentary"
1042,VI.,"description of the contest with the bull, we find Enkidu ""seizing"""
1043,VI.,"the monster by ""its tail."" [92]"
1044,VI.,
1045,VI.,That Enkidu originally played the part of the slayer is also shown
1046,VI.,by the statement that it is he who insults Ishtar by throwing a
1047,VI.,"piece of the carcass into the goddess' face, [93] adding also an"
1048,VI.,insulting speech; and this despite the fact that Ishtar in her rage
1049,VI.,accuses Gilgamesh of killing the bull. [94] It is thus evident that
1050,VI.,the Epic alters the original character of the episodes in order to
1051,VI.,"find a place for Gilgamesh, with the further desire to assign to the"
1052,VI.,"latter the _chief_ rôle. Be it noted also that Enkidu, not Gilgamesh,"
1053,VI.,is punished for the insult to Ishtar. Enkidu must therefore in the
1054,VI.,"original form of the episode have been the guilty party, who is"
1055,VI.,stricken with mortal disease as a punishment to which after twelve
1056,VI.,"days he succumbs. [95] In view of this, we may supply the name of"
1057,VI.,Enkidu in the little song introduced at the close of the encounter
1058,VI.,"with the bull, and not Gilgamesh as has hitherto been done."
1059,VI.,
1060,VI.,
1061,VI.,"""Who is distinguished among the heroes?"
1062,VI.,Who is glorious among men?
1063,VI.,"[Enkidu] is distinguished among heroes,"
1064,VI.,"[Enkidu] is glorious among men."" [96]"
1065,VI.,
1066,VI.,
1067,VI.,"Finally, the killing of lions is directly ascribed to Enkidu in the"
1068,VI.,Pennsylvania tablet:
1069,VI.,
1070,VI.,
1071,VI.,"""Lions he attacked"
1072,VI.,*     *     *     *     *
1073,VI.,"Lions he overcame"" [97]"
1074,VI.,
1075,VI.,
1076,VI.,whereas Gilgamesh appears to be afraid of lions. On his long search
1077,VI.,for Utnapishtim he says:
1078,VI.,
1079,VI.,
1080,VI.,"""On reaching the entrance of the mountain at night"
1081,VI.,"I saw lions and was afraid."" [98]"
1082,VI.,
1083,VI.,
1084,VI.,"He prays to Sin and Ishtar to protect and save him. When, therefore,"
1085,VI.,in another passage some one celebrates Gilgamesh as the one who
1086,VI.,"overcame the ""guardian,"" who dispatched Hu(m)baba in the cedar forest,"
1087,VI.,"who killed lions and overthrew the bull, [99] we have the completion"
1088,VI.,of the process which transferred to Gilgamesh exploits and powers
1089,VI.,"which originally belonged to Enkidu, though ordinarily the process"
1090,VI.,stops short at making Gilgamesh a _sharer_ in the exploits; with the
1091,VI.,"natural tendency, to be sure, to enlarge the share of the favorite."
1092,VI.,
1093,VI.,We can now understand why the two heroes are described in the
1094,VI.,"Pennsylvania tablet as alike, as born in the same place, aye, as"
1095,VI.,brothers. Gilgamesh in the Epic is merely a reflex of Enkidu. The
1096,VI.,"latter is the real hero and presumably, therefore, the older"
1097,VI.,"figure. [100] Gilgamesh resembles Enkidu, because he _is_ originally"
1098,VI.,"Enkidu. The ""resemblance"" _motif_ is merely the manner in which"
1099,VI.,"in the course of the partly popular, partly literary transfer, the"
1100,VI.,"recollection is preserved that Enkidu is the original, and Gilgamesh"
1101,VI.,the copy.
1102,VI.,
1103,VI.,The artificiality of the process which brings the two heroes together
1104,VI.,is apparent in the dreams of Gilgamesh which are interpreted by
1105,VI.,his mother as portending the coming of Enkidu. Not the conflict is
1106,VI.,"foreseen, but the subsequent close association, naïvely described as"
1107,VI.,"due to the personal charm which Enkidu exercises, which will lead"
1108,VI.,Gilgamesh to fall in love with the one whom he is to meet. The two
1109,VI.,"will become one, like man and wife."
1110,VI.,
1111,VI.,"On the basis of our investigations, we are now in a position to"
1112,VI.,reconstruct in part the cycle of episodes that once formed part of
1113,VI.,"an Enkidu Epic. The fight between Enkidu and Gilgamesh, in which"
1114,VI.,"the former is the victor, is typical of the kind of tales told of"
1115,VI.,Enkidu. He is the real prototype of the Greek Hercules. He slays
1116,VI.,"lions, he overcomes a powerful opponent dwelling in the forests of"
1117,VI.,"Lebanon, he kills the bull, and he finally succumbs to disease sent"
1118,VI.,as a punishment by an angry goddess. The death of Enkidu naturally
1119,VI.,"formed the close of the Enkidu Epic, which in its original form may,"
1120,VI.,"of course, have included other exploits besides those taken over into"
1121,VI.,the Gilgamesh Epic.
1122,VI.,
1123,VI.,
1124,VI.,
1125,VII.,VII.
1126,VII.,
1127,VII.,
1128,VII.,There is another aspect of the figure of Enkidu which is brought
1129,VII.,forward in the Pennsylvania tablet more clearly than had hitherto been
1130,VII.,the case. Many years ago attention was called to certain striking
1131,VII.,resemblances between Enkidu and the figure of the first man as
1132,VII.,described in the early chapters of Genesis. [101] At that time we had
1133,VII.,"merely the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic at our disposal,"
1134,VII.,and the main point of contact was the description of Enkidu living
1135,VII.,"with the animals, drinking and feeding like an animal, until a woman"
1136,VII.,is brought to him with whom he engages in sexual intercourse. This
1137,VII.,"suggested that Enkidu was a picture of primeval man, while the"
1138,VII.,"woman reminded one of Eve, who when she is brought to Adam becomes"
1139,VII.,"his helpmate and inseparable companion. The Biblical tale stands,"
1140,VII.,"of course, on a much higher level, and is introduced, as are other"
1141,VII.,"traditions and tales of primitive times, in the style of a parable"
1142,VII.,"to convey certain religious teachings. For all that, suggestions"
1143,VII.,of earlier conceptions crop out in the picture of Adam surrounded
1144,VII.,"by animals to which he assigns names. Such a phrase as ""there was no"
1145,VII.,"helpmate corresponding to him"" becomes intelligible on the supposition"
1146,VII.,"of an existing tradition or belief, that man once lived and, indeed,"
1147,VII.,cohabited with animals. The tales in the early chapters of Genesis
1148,VII.,"must rest on very early popular traditions, which have been cleared"
1149,VII.,of mythological and other objectionable features in order to adapt
1150,VII.,"them to the purpose of the Hebrew compilers, to serve as a medium for"
1151,VII.,illustrating certain religious teachings regarding man's place in
1152,VII.,nature and his higher destiny. From the resemblance between Enkidu
1153,VII.,"and Adam it does not, of course, follow that the latter is modelled"
1154,VII.,"upon the former, but only that both rest on similar traditions of"
1155,VII.,the condition under which men lived in primeval days prior to the
1156,VII.,beginnings of human culture.
1157,VII.,
1158,VII.,We may now pass beyond these general indications and recognize in the
1159,VII.,story of Enkidu as revealed by the Pennsylvania tablet an attempt
1160,VII.,to trace the evolution of primitive man from low beginnings to the
1161,VII.,regular and orderly family life associated with advanced culture. The
1162,VII.,new tablet furnishes a further illustration for the surprisingly early
1163,VII.,tendency among the Babylonian _literati_ to connect with popular tales
1164,VII.,teachings of a religious or ethical character. Just as the episode
1165,VII.,between Gilgamesh and the maiden Sabitum is made the occasion for
1166,VII.,introducing reflections on the inevitable fate of man to encounter
1167,VII.,"death, so the meeting of Enkidu with the woman becomes the medium"
1168,VII.,of impressing the lesson of human progress through the substitution
1169,VII.,"of bread and wine for milk and water, through the institution of"
1170,VII.,"the family, and through work and the laying up of resources. This"
1171,VII.,is the significance of the address to Enkidu in column 4 of the
1172,VII.,"Pennsylvania tablet, even though certain expressions in it are"
1173,VII.,somewhat obscure. The connection of the entire episode of Enkidu and
1174,VII.,the woman with Gilgamesh is very artificial; and it becomes much more
1175,VII.,intelligible if we disassociate it from its present entanglement in
1176,VII.,"the Epic. In Gilgamesh's dream, portending the meeting with Enkidu,"
1177,VII.,nothing is said of the woman who is the companion of the latter. The
1178,VII.,passage in which Enkidu is created by Aruru to oppose Gilgamesh [102]
1179,VII.,betrays evidence of having been worked over in order to bring Enkidu
1180,VII.,into association with the longing of the people of Erech to get rid
1181,VII.,of a tyrannical character. The people in their distress appeal to
1182,VII.,"Aruru to create a rival to Gilgamesh. In response,"
1183,VII.,
1184,VII.,
1185,VII.,"""Aruru upon hearing this created a man of Anu in her heart."""
1186,VII.,
1187,VII.,
1188,VII.,"Now this ""man of Anu"" cannot possibly be Enkidu, for the sufficient"
1189,VII.,reason that a few lines further on Enkidu is described as an offspring
1190,VII.,"of Ninib. Moreover, the being created is not a ""counterpart"""
1191,VII.,"of Gilgamesh, but an animal-man, as the description that follows"
1192,VII.,"shows. We must separate lines 30-33 in which the creation of the ""Anu"
1193,VII.,"man"" is described from lines 34-41 in which the creation of Enkidu is"
1194,VII.,"narrated. Indeed, these lines strike one as the proper _beginning_"
1195,VII.,"of the original Enkidu story, which would naturally start out with"
1196,VII.,his birth and end with his death. The description is clearly an
1197,VII.,"account of the creation of the first man, in which capacity Enkidu"
1198,VII.,is brought forward.
1199,VII.,
1200,VII.,
1201,VII.,"""Aruru washed her hands, broke off clay,"
1202,VII.,threw it on the field [103]
1203,VII.,"... created Enkidu, the hero, a lofty"
1204,VII.,"offspring of the host of Ninib."" [104]"
1205,VII.,
1206,VII.,
1207,VII.,"The description of Enkidu follows, with his body covered with hair"
1208,VII.,"like an animal, and eating and drinking with the animals. There"
1209,VII.,follows an episode [105] which has no connection whatsoever with
1210,VII.,"the Gilgamesh Epic, but which is clearly intended to illustrate how"
1211,VII.,Enkidu came to abandon the life with the animals. A hunter sees Enkidu
1212,VII.,"and is amazed at the strange sight--an animal and yet a man. Enkidu,"
1213,VII.,"as though resenting his condition, becomes enraged at the sight of"
1214,VII.,"the hunter, and the latter goes to his father and tells him of the"
1215,VII.,"strange creature whom he is unable to catch. In reply, the father"
1216,VII.,advises his son to take a woman with him when next he goes out on
1217,VII.,"his pursuit, and to have the woman remove her dress in the presence"
1218,VII.,"of Enkidu, who will then approach her, and after intercourse with"
1219,VII.,her will abandon the animals among whom he lives. By this device he
1220,VII.,will catch the strange creature. Lines 14-18 of column 3 in the first
1221,VII.,tablet in which the father of the hunter refers to Gilgamesh must be
1222,VII.,"regarded as a later insertion, a part of the reconstruction of the"
1223,VII.,tale to connect the episode with Gilgamesh. The advice of the father
1224,VII.,"to his son, the hunter, begins, line 19,"
1225,VII.,
1226,VII.,
1227,VII.,"""Go my hunter, take with thee a woman."""
1228,VII.,
1229,VII.,
1230,VII.,"In the reconstructed tale, the father tells his son to go to Gilgamesh"
1231,VII.,to relate to him the strange appearance of the animal-man; but there
1232,VII.,"is clearly no purpose in this, as is shown by the fact that when the"
1233,VII.,"hunter does so, Gilgamesh makes _precisely the same speech_ as does"
1234,VII.,"the father of the hunter. Lines 40-44 of column 3, in which Gilgamesh"
1235,VII.,is represented as speaking to the hunter form a complete _doublet_
1236,VII.,"to lines 19-24, beginning"
1237,VII.,
1238,VII.,
1239,VII.,"""Go, my hunter, take with thee a woman, etc."""
1240,VII.,
1241,VII.,
1242,VII.,"and similarly the description of Enkidu appears twice, lines 2-12"
1243,VII.,"in an address of the hunter to his father, and lines 29-39 in the"
1244,VII.,address of the hunter to Gilgamesh.
1245,VII.,
1246,VII.,The artificiality of the process of introducing Gilgamesh into
1247,VII.,the episode is revealed by this awkward and entirely meaningless
1248,VII.,repetition. We may therefore reconstruct the first two scenes in the
1249,VII.,Enkidu Epic as follows: [106]
1250,VII.,
1251,VII.,"Tablet I, col. 2, 34-35: Creation of Enkidu by Aruru."
1252,VII.,
1253,VII.,36-41: Description of Enkidu's hairy body and of his life with the
1254,VII.,animals.
1255,VII.,
1256,VII.,"42-50: The hunter sees Enkidu, who shows his anger, as also his woe,"
1257,VII.,at his condition.
1258,VII.,
1259,VII.,"3, 1-12: The hunter tells his father of the strange being who pulls"
1260,VII.,"up the traps which the hunter digs, and who tears the nets so that"
1261,VII.,the hunter is unable to catch him or the animals.
1262,VII.,
1263,VII.,19-24: The father of the hunter advises his son on his next expedition
1264,VII.,to take a woman with him in order to lure the strange being from his
1265,VII.,life with the animals.
1266,VII.,
1267,VII.,"Line 25, beginning ""On the advice of his father,"" must have set forth,"
1268,VII.,"in the original form of the episode, how the hunter procured the"
1269,VII.,woman and took her with him to meet Enkidu.
1270,VII.,
1271,VII.,"Column 4 gives in detail the meeting between the two, and naïvely"
1272,VII.,"describes how the woman exposes her charms to Enkidu, who is captivated"
1273,VII.,by her and stays with her six days and seven nights. The animals see
1274,VII.,the change in Enkidu and run away from him. He has been transformed
1275,VII.,through the woman. So far the episode. In the Assyrian version there
1276,VII.,"follows an address of the woman to Enkidu beginning (col. 4, 34):"
1277,VII.,
1278,VII.,
1279,VII.,"""Beautiful art thou, Enkidu, like a god art thou."""
1280,VII.,
1281,VII.,
1282,VII.,"We find her urging him to go with her to Erech, there to meet Gilgamesh"
1283,VII.,and to enjoy the pleasures of city life with plenty of beautiful
1284,VII.,"maidens. Gilgamesh, she adds, will expect Enkidu, for the coming"
1285,VII.,of the latter to Erech has been foretold in a dream. It is evident
1286,VII.,that here we have again the later transformation of the Enkidu Epic
1287,VII.,in order to bring the two heroes together. Will it be considered too
1288,VII.,bold if we assume that in the original form the address of the woman
1289,VII.,and the construction of the episode were such as we find preserved in
1290,VII.,"part in columns 2 to 4 of the Pennsylvania tablet, which forms part"
1291,VII.,of the new material that can now be added to the Epic? The address
1292,VII.,of the woman begins in line 51 of the Pennsylvania tablet:
1293,VII.,
1294,VII.,
1295,VII.,"""I gaze upon thee, Enkidu, like a god art thou."""
1296,VII.,
1297,VII.,
1298,VII.,"This corresponds to the line in the Assyrian version (I, 4, 34)"
1299,VII.,"as given above, just as lines 52-53:"
1300,VII.,
1301,VII.,
1302,VII.,"""Why with the cattle"
1303,VII.,"Dost thou roam across the field?"""
1304,VII.,
1305,VII.,
1306,VII.,"correspond to I, 4, 35, of the Assyrian version. There follows in both"
1307,VII.,the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version the appeal of the woman
1308,VII.,"to Enkidu, to allow her to lead him to Erech where Gilgamesh dwells"
1309,VII.,"(Pennsylvania tablet lines 54-61 = Assyrian version I, 4, 36-39);"
1310,VII.,but in the Pennsylvania tablet we now have a _second_ speech (lines
1311,VII.,"62-63) beginning like the first one with _al-ka_, ""come:"""
1312,VII.,
1313,VII.,
1314,VII.,"""Come, arise from the accursed ground."""
1315,VII.,
1316,VII.,
1317,VII.,"Enkidu consents, and now the woman takes off her garments and clothes"
1318,VII.,"the naked Enkidu, while putting another garment on herself. She takes"
1319,VII.,"hold of his hand and leads him to the sheepfolds (not to Erech!!),"
1320,VII.,where bread and wine are placed before him. Accustomed hitherto
1321,VII.,"to sucking milk with cattle, Enkidu does not know what to do with"
1322,VII.,the strange food until encouraged and instructed by the woman. The
1323,VII.,entire third column is taken up with this introduction of Enkidu
1324,VII.,"to civilized life in a pastoral community, and the scene ends with"
1325,VII.,Enkidu becoming a guardian of flocks. Now all this has nothing to
1326,VII.,"do with Gilgamesh, and clearly sets forth an entirely different"
1327,VII.,idea from the one embodied in the meeting of the two heroes. In the
1328,VII.,"original Enkidu tale, the animal-man is looked upon as the type of a"
1329,VII.,"primitive savage, and the point of the tale is to illustrate in the"
1330,VII.,naïve manner characteristic of folklore the evolution to the higher
1331,VII.,"form of pastoral life. This aspect of the incident is, therefore,"
1332,VII.,to be separated from the other phase which has as its chief _motif_
1333,VII.,the bringing of the two heroes together.
1334,VII.,
1335,VII.,"We now obtain, thanks to the new section revealed by the Pennsylvania"
1336,VII.,"tablet, a further analogy [107] with the story of Adam and Eve,"
1337,VII.,"but with this striking difference, that whereas in the Babylonian"
1338,VII.,"tale the woman is the medium leading man to the higher life, in the"
1339,VII.,Biblical story the woman is the tempter who brings misfortune to
1340,VII.,"man. This contrast is, however, not inherent in the Biblical story,"
1341,VII.,"but due to the point of view of the Biblical writer, who is somewhat"
1342,VII.,"pessimistically inclined and looks upon primitive life, when man went"
1343,VII.,"naked and lived in a garden, eating of fruits that grew of themselves,"
1344,VII.,as the blessed life in contrast to advanced culture which leads
1345,VII.,to agriculture and necessitates hard work as the means of securing
1346,VII.,one's substance. Hence the woman through whom Adam eats of the tree
1347,VII.,of knowledge and becomes conscious of being naked is looked upon as
1348,VII.,"an evil tempter, entailing the loss of the primeval life of bliss in"
1349,VII.,a gorgeous Paradise. The Babylonian point of view is optimistic. The
1350,VII.,change to civilized life--involving the wearing of clothes and the
1351,VII.,eating of food that is cultivated (bread and wine) is looked upon as an
1352,VII.,advance. Hence the woman is viewed as the medium of raising man to a
1353,VII.,higher level. The feature common to the Biblical and Babylonian tales
1354,VII.,is the attachment of a lesson to early folk-tales. The story of Adam
1355,VII.,"and Eve, [108] as the story of Enkidu and the woman, is told _with"
1356,VII.,a purpose_. Starting with early traditions of men's primitive life
1357,VII.,"on earth, that may have arisen independently, Hebrew and Babylonian"
1358,VII.,"writers diverged, each group going its own way, each reflecting the"
1359,VII.,particular point of view from which the evolution of human society
1360,VII.,was viewed.
1361,VII.,
1362,VII.,"Leaving the analogy between the Biblical and Babylonian tales aside,"
1363,VII.,the main point of value for us in the Babylonian story of Enkidu
1364,VII.,"and the woman is the proof furnished by the analysis, made possible"
1365,VII.,"through the Pennsylvania tablet, that the tale can be separated"
1366,VII.,from its subsequent connection with Gilgamesh. We can continue this
1367,VII.,"process of separation in the fourth column, where the woman instructs"
1368,VII.,Enkidu in the further duty of living his life with the woman decreed
1369,VII.,"for him, to raise a family, to engage in work, to build cities and"
1370,VII.,to gather resources. All this is looked upon in the same optimistic
1371,VII.,"spirit as marking progress, whereas the Biblical writer, consistent"
1372,VII.,"with his point of view, looks upon work as a curse, and makes Cain,"
1373,VII.,"the murderer, also the founder of cities. The step to the higher"
1374,VII.,forms of life is not an advance according to the J document. It is
1375,VII.,"interesting to note that even the phrase the ""cursed ground"" occurs"
1376,VII.,in both the Babylonian and Biblical tales; but whereas in the latter
1377,VII.,"(Gen. 3, 17) it is because of the hard work entailed in raising the"
1378,VII.,"products of the earth that the ground is cursed, in the former (lines"
1379,VII.,62-63) it is the place in which Enkidu lives _before_ he advances to
1380,VII.,"the dignity of human life that is ""cursed,"" and which he is asked"
1381,VII.,"to leave. Adam is expelled from Paradise as a punishment, whereas"
1382,VII.,Enkidu is implored to leave it as a necessary step towards _progress_
1383,VII.,to a higher form of existence. The contrast between the Babylonian
1384,VII.,and the Biblical writer extends to the view taken of viniculture. The
1385,VII.,Biblical writer (again the J document) looks upon Noah's drunkenness
1386,VII.,as a disgrace. Noah loses his sense of shame and uncovers himself
1387,VII.,"(Genesis 9, 21), whereas in the Babylonian description Enkidu's jolly"
1388,VII.,spirit after he has drunk seven jars of wine meets with approval. The
1389,VII.,Biblical point of view is that he who drinks wine becomes drunk;
1390,VII.,"[109] the Babylonian says, if you drink wine you become happy. [110]"
1391,VII.,
1392,VII.,If the thesis here set forth of the original character and import
1393,VII.,"of the episode of Enkidu with the woman is correct, we may again"
1394,VII.,"regard lines 149-153 of the Pennsylvania tablet, in which Gilgamesh"
1395,VII.,"is introduced, as a later addition to bring the two heroes into"
1396,VII.,association. The episode in its original form ended with the
1397,VII.,"introduction of Enkidu first to pastoral life, and then to the still"
1398,VII.,higher city life with regulated forms of social existence.
1399,VII.,
1400,VII.,"Now, to be sure, this Enkidu has little in common with the Enkidu"
1401,VII.,"who is described as a powerful warrior, a Hercules, who kills lions,"
1402,VII.,"overcomes the giant Huwawa, and dispatches a great bull, but it is"
1403,VII.,the nature of folklore everywhere to attach to traditions about
1404,VII.,a favorite hero all kinds of tales with which originally he had
1405,VII.,"nothing to do. Enkidu, as such a favorite, is viewed also as the"
1406,VII.,"type of primitive man, [111] and so there arose gradually an Epic"
1407,VII.,"which began with his birth, pictured him as half-animal half-man,"
1408,VII.,"told how he emerged from this state, how he became civilized, was"
1409,VII.,"clothed, learned to eat food and drink wine, how he shaved off the"
1410,VII.,"hair with which his body was covered, [112] anointed himself--in short,"
1411,VII.,
1412,VII.,
1413,VII.,"""He became manlike."" [113]"
1414,VII.,
1415,VII.,
1416,VII.,"Thereupon he is taught his duties as a husband, is introduced to"
1417,VII.,"the work of building, and to laying aside supplies, and the like. The"
1418,VII.,"fully-developed and full-fledged hero then engages in various exploits,"
1419,VII.,of which _some_ are now embodied in the Gilgamesh Epic. Who this Enkidu
1420,VII.,"was, we are not in a position to determine, but the suggestion has"
1421,VII.,"been thrown out above that he is a personage foreign to Babylonia,"
1422,VII.,"that his home appears to be in the undefined Amurru district, and"
1423,VII.,"that he conquers that district. The original tale of Enkidu, if this"
1424,VII.,"view be correct, must therefore have been carried to the Euphrates"
1425,VII.,"Valley, at a very remote period, with one of the migratory waves that"
1426,VII.,brought a western people as invaders into Babylonia. Here the tale
1427,VII.,"was combined with stories current of another hero, Gilgamesh--perhaps"
1428,VII.,also of Western origin--whose conquest of Erech likewise represents
1429,VII.,"an invasion of Babylonia. The center of the Gilgamesh tale was Erech,"
1430,VII.,"and in the process of combining the stories of Enkidu and Gilgamesh,"
1431,VII.,Enkidu is brought to Erech and the two perform exploits in common. In
1432,VII.,"such a combination, the aim would be to utilize all the incidents of"
1433,VII.,"_both_ tales. The woman who accompanies Enkidu, therefore, becomes"
1434,VII.,the medium of bringing the two heroes together. The story of the
1435,VII.,evolution of primitive man to civilized life is transformed into the
1436,VII.,"tale of Enkidu's removal to Erech, and elaborated with all kinds of"
1437,VII.,"details, among which we have, as perhaps embodying a genuine historical"
1438,VII.,"tradition, the encounter of the two heroes."
1439,VII.,
1440,VII.,"Before passing on, we have merely to note the very large part taken"
1441,VII.,in both the old Babylonian and the Assyrian version by the struggle
1442,VII.,"against Huwawa. The entire Yale tablet--forming, as we have seen,"
1443,VII.,the third of the series--is taken up with the preparation for the
1444,VII.,"struggle, and with the repeated warnings given to Gilgamesh against"
1445,VII.,the dangerous undertaking. The fourth tablet must have recounted the
1446,VII.,"struggle itself, and it is not improbable that this episode extended"
1447,VII.,"into the fifth tablet, since in the Assyrian version this is the"
1448,VII.,case. The elaboration of the story is in itself an argument in favor
1449,VII.,of assuming some historical background for it--the recollection of
1450,VII.,the conquest of Amurru by some powerful warrior; and we have seen
1451,VII.,that this conquest must be ascribed to Enkidu and not to Gilgamesh.

1458,VIII.,"If, now, Enkidu is not only the older figure but the one who is the"
1459,VIII.,"real hero of the most notable episode in the Gilgamesh Epic; if,"
1460,VIII.,"furthermore, Enkidu is the Hercules who kills lions and dispatches"
1461,VIII.,"the bull sent by an enraged goddess, what becomes of Gilgamesh? What"
1462,VIII.,is left for him?
1463,VIII.,
1464,VIII.,"In the first place, he is definitely the conqueror of Erech. He builds"
1465,VIII.,"the wall of Erech, [114] and we may assume that the designation of"
1466,VIII.,"the city as _Uruk supûri_, ""the walled Erech,"" [115] rests upon this"
1467,VIII.,"tradition. He is also associated with the great temple Eanna, ""the"
1468,VIII.,"heavenly house,"" in Erech. To Gilgamesh belongs also the unenviable"
1469,VIII.,tradition of having exercised his rule in Erech so harshly that the
1470,VIII.,people are impelled to implore Aruru to create a rival who may rid
1471,VIII.,"the district of the cruel tyrant, who is described as snatching sons"
1472,VIII.,"and daughters from their families, and in other ways terrifying the"
1473,VIII.,"population--an early example of ""Schrecklichkeit."" Tablets II to"
1474,VIII.,V inclusive of the Assyrian version being taken up with the Huwawa
1475,VIII.,"episode, modified with a view of bringing the two heroes together,"
1476,VIII.,"we come at once to the sixth tablet, which tells the story of how"
1477,VIII.,"the goddess Ishtar wooed Gilgamesh, and of the latter's rejection"
1478,VIII.,of her advances. This tale is distinctly a nature myth. The attempt
1479,VIII.,of Gressmann [116] to find some historical background to the episode
1480,VIII.,is a failure. The goddess Ishtar symbolizes the earth which woos the
1481,VIII.,"sun in the spring, but whose love is fatal, for after a few months"
1482,VIII.,"the sun's power begins to wane. Gilgamesh, who in incantation hymns"
1483,VIII.,"is invoked in terms which show that he was conceived as a sun-god,"
1484,VIII.,"[117] recalls to the goddess how she changed her lovers into animals,"
1485,VIII.,"like Circe of Greek mythology, and brought them to grief. Enraged at"
1486,VIII.,"Gilgamesh's insult to her vanity, she flies to her father Anu and cries"
1487,VIII.,for revenge. At this point the episode of the creation of the bull is
1488,VIII.,"introduced, but if the analysis above given is correct it is Enkidu"
1489,VIII.,"who is the hero in dispatching the bull, and we must assume that the"
1490,VIII.,sickness with which Gilgamesh is smitten is the punishment sent by Anu
1491,VIII.,to avenge the insult to his daughter. This sickness symbolizes the
1492,VIII.,waning strength of the sun after midsummer is past. The sun recedes
1493,VIII.,"from the earth, and this was pictured in the myth as the sun-god's"
1494,VIII.,rejection of Ishtar; Gilgamesh's fear of death marks the approach
1495,VIII.,"of the winter season, when the sun appears to have lost its vigor"
1496,VIII.,"completely and is near to death. The entire episode is, therefore,"
1497,VIII.,"a nature myth, symbolical of the passing of spring to midsummer and"
1498,VIII.,then to the bare season. The myth has been attached to Gilgamesh as
1499,VIII.,"a favorite figure, and then woven into a pattern with the episode"
1500,VIII.,of Enkidu and the bull. The bull episode can be detached from the
1501,VIII.,nature myth without any loss to the symbolism of the tale of Ishtar
1502,VIII.,and Gilgamesh.
1503,VIII.,
1504,VIII.,"As already suggested, with Enkidu's death after this conquest"
1505,VIII.,of the bull the original Enkidu Epic came to an end. In order to
1506,VIII.,"connect Gilgamesh with Enkidu, the former is represented as sharing"
1507,VIII.,"in the struggle against the bull. Enkidu is punished with death,"
1508,VIII.,while Gilgamesh is smitten with disease. Since both shared equally
1509,VIII.,"in the guilt, the punishment should have been the same for both. The"
1510,VIII.,differentiation may be taken as an indication that Gilgamesh's disease
1511,VIII.,"has nothing to do with the bull episode, but is merely part of the"
1512,VIII.,nature myth.
1513,VIII.,
1514,VIII.,Gilgamesh now begins a series of wanderings in search of
1515,VIII.,"the restoration of his vigor, and this _motif_ is evidently a"
1516,VIII.,continuation of the nature myth to symbolize the sun's wanderings
1517,VIII.,during the dark winter in the hope of renewed vigor with the coming
1518,VIII.,of the spring. Professor Haupt's view is that the disease from which
1519,VIII.,"Gilgamesh is supposed to be suffering is of a venereal character,"
1520,VIII.,affecting the organs of reproduction. This would confirm the position
1521,VIII.,here taken that the myth symbolizes the loss of the sun's vigor. The
1522,VIII.,sun's rays are no longer strong enough to fertilize the earth. In
1523,VIII.,"accord with this, Gilgamesh's search for healing leads him to the"
1524,VIII.,dark regions [118] in which the scorpion-men dwell. The terrors of
1525,VIII.,the region symbolize the gloom of the winter season. At last Gilgamesh
1526,VIII.,"reaches a region of light again, described as a landscape situated at"
1527,VIII.,the sea. The maiden in control of this region bolts the gate against
1528,VIII.,"Gilgamesh's approach, but the latter forces his entrance. It is the"
1529,VIII.,"picture of the sun-god bursting through the darkness, to emerge as"
1530,VIII.,the youthful reinvigorated sun-god of the spring.
1531,VIII.,
1532,VIII.,Now with the tendency to attach to popular tales and nature myths
1533,VIII.,"lessons illustrative of current beliefs and aspirations, Gilgamesh's"
1534,VIII.,search for renewal of life is viewed as man's longing for eternal
1535,VIII.,life. The sun-god's waning power after midsummer is past suggests
1536,VIII.,man's growing weakness after the meridian of life has been left
1537,VIII.,"behind. Winter is death, and man longs to escape it. Gilgamesh's"
1538,VIII.,"wanderings are used as illustration of this longing, and accordingly"
1539,VIII.,the search for life becomes also the quest for immortality. Can the
1540,VIII.,precious boon of eternal life be achieved? Popular fancy created
1541,VIII.,the figure of a favorite of the gods who had escaped a destructive
1542,VIII.,deluge in which all mankind had perished. [119] Gilgamesh hears of
1543,VIII.,this favorite and determines to seek him out and learn from him the
1544,VIII.,"secret of eternal life. The deluge story, again a pure nature myth,"
1545,VIII.,"symbolical of the rainy season which destroys all life in nature,"
1546,VIII.,is thus attached to the Epic. Gilgamesh after many adventures finds
1547,VIII.,"himself in the presence of the survivor of the Deluge who, although"
1548,VIII.,"human, enjoys immortal life among the gods. He asks the survivor"
1549,VIII.,"how he came to escape the common fate of mankind, and in reply"
1550,VIII.,Utnapishtim tells the story of the catastrophe that brought about
1551,VIII.,universal destruction. The moral of the tale is obvious. Only those
1552,VIII.,singled out by the special favor of the gods can hope to be removed
1553,VIII.,"to the distant ""source of the streams"" and live forever. The rest of"
1554,VIII.,mankind must face death as the end of life.
1555,VIII.,
1556,VIII.,That the story of the Deluge is told in the eleventh tablet of the
1557,VIII.,"series, corresponding to the eleventh month, known as the month of"
1558,VIII.,"""rain curse"" [120] and marking the height of the rainy season, may"
1559,VIII.,"be intentional, just as it may not be accidental that Gilgamesh's"
1560,VIII.,"rejection of Ishtar is recounted in the sixth tablet, corresponding to"
1561,VIII.,"the sixth month, [121] which marks the end of the summer season. The"
1562,VIII.,"two tales may have formed part of a cycle of myths, distributed"
1563,VIII.,"among the months of the year. The Gilgamesh Epic, however, does"
1564,VIII.,not form such a cycle. Both myths have been artificially attached
1565,VIII.,to the adventures of the hero. For the deluge story we now have the
1566,VIII.,"definite proof for its independent existence, through Dr. Poebel's"
1567,VIII.,"publication of a Sumerian text which embodies the tale, [122] and"
1568,VIII.,"without any reference to Gilgamesh. Similarly, Scheil and Hilprecht"
1569,VIII.,have published fragments of deluge stories written in Akkadian and
1570,VIII.,likewise without any connection with the Gilgamesh Epic. [123]
1571,VIII.,
1572,VIII.,"In the Epic the story leads to another episode attached to Gilgamesh,"
1573,VIII.,"namely, the search for a magic plant growing in deep water, which has"
1574,VIII.,"the power of restoring old age to youth. Utnapishtim, the survivor of"
1575,VIII.,"the deluge, is moved through pity for Gilgamesh, worn out by his long"
1576,VIII.,"wanderings. At the request of his wife, Utnapishtim decides to tell"
1577,VIII.,"Gilgamesh of this plant, and he succeeds in finding it. He plucks it"
1578,VIII.,"and decides to take it back to Erech so that all may enjoy the benefit,"
1579,VIII.,but on his way stops to bathe in a cool cistern. A serpent comes along
1580,VIII.,"and snatches the plant from him, and he is forced to return to Erech"
1581,VIII.,"with his purpose unachieved. Man cannot hope, when old age comes on,"
1582,VIII.,to escape death as the end of everything.
1583,VIII.,
1584,VIII.,"Lastly, the twelfth tablet of the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh"
1585,VIII.,"Epic is of a purely didactic character, bearing evidence of having"
1586,VIII.,been added as a further illustration of the current belief that there
1587,VIII.,is no escape from the nether world to which all must go after life has
1588,VIII.,come to an end. Proper burial and suitable care of the dead represent
1589,VIII.,all that can be done in order to secure a fairly comfortable rest for
1590,VIII.,those who have passed out of this world. Enkidu is once more introduced
1591,VIII.,into this episode. His shade is invoked by Gilgamesh and rises up out
1592,VIII.,"of the lower world to give a discouraging reply to Gilgamesh's request,"
1593,VIII.,
1594,VIII.,
1595,VIII.,"""Tell me, my friend, tell me, my friend,"
1596,VIII.,The law of the earth which thou hast
1597,VIII.,"experienced, tell me,"""
1598,VIII.,
1599,VIII.,
1600,VIII.,The mournful message comes back:
1601,VIII.,
1602,VIII.,
1603,VIII.,"""I cannot tell thee, my friend, I cannot tell."""
1604,VIII.,
1605,VIII.,
1606,VIII.,Death is a mystery and must always remain such. The historical
1607,VIII.,Gilgamesh has clearly no connection with the figure introduced into
1608,VIII.,"this twelfth tablet. Indeed, as already suggested, the Gilgamesh Epic"
1609,VIII.,"must have ended with the return to Erech, as related at the close of"
1610,VIII.,the eleventh tablet. The twelfth tablet was added by some school-men of
1611,VIII.,"Babylonia (or perhaps of Assyria), purely for the purpose of conveying"
1612,VIII.,a summary of the teachings in regard to the fate of the dead. Whether
1613,VIII.,"these six episodes covering the sixth to the twelfth tablets, (1) the"
1614,VIII.,"nature myth, (2) the killing of the divine bull, (3) the punishment"
1615,VIII.,"of Gilgamesh and the death of Enkidu, (4) Gilgamesh's wanderings,"
1616,VIII.,"(5) the Deluge, (6) the search for immortality, were all included"
1617,VIII.,"at the time that the old Babylonian version was compiled cannot, of"
1618,VIII.,"course, be determined until we have that version in a more complete"
1619,VIII.,form. Since the two tablets thus far recovered show that as early as
1620,VIII.,2000 B.C. the Enkidu tale had already been amalgamated with the current
1621,VIII.,"stories about Gilgamesh, and the endeavor made to transfer the traits"
1622,VIII.,"of the former to the latter, it is eminently likely that the story of"
1623,VIII.,"Ishtar's unhappy love adventure with Gilgamesh was included, as well"
1624,VIII.,as Gilgamesh's punishment and the death of Enkidu. With the evidence
1625,VIII.,furnished by Meissner's fragment of a version of the old Babylonian
1626,VIII.,"revision and by our two tablets, of the early disposition to make"
1627,VIII.,popular tales the medium of illustrating current beliefs and the
1628,VIII.,"teachings of the temple schools, it may furthermore be concluded that"
1629,VIII.,the death of Enkidu and the punishment of Gilgamesh were utilized for
1630,VIII.,"didactic purposes in the old Babylonian version. On the other hand,"
1631,VIII.,the proof for the existence of the deluge story in the Hammurabi
1632,VIII.,"period and some centuries later, _independent_ of any connection"
1633,VIII.,"with the Gilgamesh Epic, raises the question whether in the old"
1634,VIII.,"Babylonian version, of which our two tablets form a part, the deluge"
1635,VIII.,"tale was already woven into the pattern of the Epic. At all events,"
1636,VIII.,"till proof to the contrary is forthcoming, we may assume that the"
1637,VIII.,"twelfth tablet of the Assyrian version, though also reverting to a"
1638,VIII.,"Babylonian original, dates as the _latest_ addition to the Epic from"
1639,VIII.,a period subsequent to 2000 B.C.; and that the same is probably the
1640,VIII.,case with the eleventh tablet.
1641,VIII.,
1642,VIII.,
1643,VIII.,
1644,IX.,IX.
1645,IX.,
1646,IX.,
1647,IX.,"To sum up, there are four main currents that flow together in the"
1648,IX.,Gilgamesh Epic even in its old Babylonian form: (1) the adventures of
1649,IX.,"a mighty warrior Enkidu, resting perhaps on a faint tradition of the"
1650,IX.,conquest of Amurru by the hero; (2) the more definite recollection
1651,IX.,of the exploits of a foreign invader of Babylonia by the name of
1652,IX.,"Gilgamesh, whose home appears likewise to have been in the West; [124]"
1653,IX.,(3) nature myths and didactic tales transferred to Enkidu and Gilgamesh
1654,IX.,"as popular figures; and (4) the process of weaving the traditions,"
1655,IX.,"exploits, myths and didactic tales together, in the course of which"
1656,IX.,"process Gilgamesh becomes the main hero, and Enkidu his companion."
1657,IX.,
1658,IX.,"Furthermore, our investigation has shown that to Enkidu belongs the"
1659,IX.,"episode with the woman, used to illustrate the evolution of primitive"
1660,IX.,"man to the ways and conditions of civilized life, the conquest of"
1661,IX.,"Huwawa in the land of Amurru, the killing of lions and also of the"
1662,IX.,"bull, while Gilgamesh is the hero who conquers Erech. Identified with"
1663,IX.,"the sun-god, the nature myth of the union of the sun with the earth and"
1664,IX.,the subsequent separation of the two is also transferred to him. The
1665,IX.,"wanderings of the hero, smitten with disease, are a continuation of"
1666,IX.,"the nature myth, symbolizing the waning vigor of the sun with the"
1667,IX.,approach of the wintry season.
1668,IX.,
1669,IX.,The details of the process which led to making Gilgamesh the favorite
1670,IX.,"figure, to whom the traits and exploits of Enkidu and of the sun-god"
1671,IX.,"are transferred, escape us, but of the fact that Enkidu is the _older_"
1672,IX.,"figure, of whom certain adventures were set forth in a tale that"
1673,IX.,"once had an independent existence, there can now be little doubt in"
1674,IX.,the face of the evidence furnished by the two tablets of the old
1675,IX.,Babylonian version; just as the study of these tablets shows that
1676,IX.,"in the combination of the tales of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, the former"
1677,IX.,is the prototype of which Gilgamesh is the copy. If the two are
1678,IX.,"regarded as brothers, as born in the same place, even resembling one"
1679,IX.,"another in appearance and carrying out their adventures in common,"
1680,IX.,it is because in the process of combination Gilgamesh becomes the
1681,IX.,_reflex_ of Enkidu. That Enkidu is not the figure created by Aruru to
1682,IX.,relieve Erech of its tyrannical ruler is also shown by the fact that
1683,IX.,Gilgamesh remains in control of Erech. It is to Erech that he returns
1684,IX.,when he fails of his purpose to learn the secret of escape from old
1685,IX.,"age and death. Erech is, therefore, not relieved of the presence of"
1686,IX.,"the ruthless ruler through Enkidu. The ""Man of Anu"" formed by Aruru"
1687,IX.,as a deliverer is confused in the course of the growth of the Epic
1688,IX.,"with Enkidu, the offspring of Ninib, and in this way we obtain the"
1689,IX.,strange contradiction of Enkidu and Gilgamesh appearing first as bitter
1690,IX.,rivals and then as close and inseparable friends. It is of the nature
1691,IX.,of Epic compositions everywhere to eliminate unnecessary figures by
1692,IX.,concentrating on one favorite the traits belonging to another or to
1693,IX.,several others.
1694,IX.,
1695,IX.,The close association of Enkidu and Gilgamesh which becomes one of
1696,IX.,the striking features in the combination of the tales of these two
1697,IX.,"heroes naturally recalls the ""Heavenly Twins"" _motif_, which has been"
1698,IX.,so fully and so suggestively treated by Professor J. Rendell Harris
1699,IX.,"in his _Cult of the Heavenly Twins_, (London, 1906). Professor Harris"
1700,IX.,has conclusively shown how widespread the tendency is to associate
1701,IX.,two divine or semi-divine beings in myths and legends as inseparable
1702,IX.,"companions [125] or twins, like Castor and Pollux, Romulus and Remus,"
1703,IX.,"[126] the Acvins in the Rig-Veda, [127] Cain and Abel, Jacob and"
1704,IX.,"Esau in the Old Testament, the Kabiri of the Phoenicians, [128]"
1705,IX.,"Herakles and Iphikles in Greek mythology, Ambrica and Fidelio in"
1706,IX.,"Teutonic mythology, Patollo and Potrimpo in old Prussian mythology,"
1707,IX.,"Cautes and Cautopates in Mithraism, Jesus and Thomas (according to"
1708,IX.,"the Syriac Acts of Thomas), and the various illustrations of ""Dioscuri"
1709,IX.,"in Christian Legends,"" set forth by Dr. Harris in his work under this"
1710,IX.,"title, which carries the _motif_ far down into the period of legends"
1711,IX.,"about Christian Saints who appear in pairs, including the reference"
1712,IX.,to such a pair in Shakespeare's Henry V:
1713,IX.,
1714,IX.,
1715,IX.,"""And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by"
1716,IX.,"From that day to the ending of the world.""--(_Act, IV,"
1717,IX.,"3, 57-58._)"
1718,IX.,
1719,IX.,
1720,IX.,There are indeed certain parallels which suggest that Enkidu-Gilgamesh
1721,IX.,"may represent a Babylonian counterpart to the ""Heavenly Twins."" In"
1722,IX.,"the Indo-Iranian, Greek and Roman mythology, the twins almost"
1723,IX.,invariably act together. In unison they proceed on expeditions to
1724,IX.,punish enemies. [129]
1725,IX.,
1726,IX.,"But after all, the parallels are of too general a character to be of"
1727,IX.,much moment; and moreover the parallels stop short at the critical
1728,IX.,"point, for Gilgamesh though worsted is _not_ killed by Enkidu,"
1729,IX.,"whereas one of the ""Heavenly Twins"" is always killed by the brother,"
1730,IX.,"as Abel is by Cain, and Iphikles by his twin brother Herakles. Even"
1731,IX.,"the trait which is frequent in the earliest forms of the ""Heavenly"
1732,IX.,"Twins,"" according to which one is immortal and the other is mortal,"
1733,IX.,"though applying in a measure to Enkidu who is killed by Ishtar, while"
1734,IX.,"Gilgamesh the offspring of a divine pair is only smitten with disease,"
1735,IX.,is too unsubstantial to warrant more than a general comparison between
1736,IX.,"the Enkidu-Gilgamesh pair and the various forms of the ""twin"" _motif_"
1737,IX.,"found throughout the ancient world. For all that, the point is of some"
1738,IX.,interest that in the Gilgamesh Epic we should encounter two figures who
1739,IX.,are portrayed as possessing the same traits and accomplishing feats in
1740,IX.,"common, which suggest a partial parallel to the various forms in which"
1741,IX.,"the twin-_motif_ appears in the mythologies, folk-lore and legends"
1742,IX.,of many nations; and it may be that in some of these instances the
1743,IX.,"duplication is due, as in the case of Enkidu and Gilgamesh, to an"
1744,IX.,actual transfer of the traits of one figure to another who usurped
1745,IX.,his place.
1746,IX.,
1747,IX.,
1748,IX.,
1749,X.,X.
1750,X.,
1751,X.,
1752,X.,In concluding this study of the two recently discovered tablets of
1753,X.,the old Babylonian version of the Gilgamesh Epic which has brought us
1754,X.,several steps further in the interpretation and in our understanding
1755,X.,of the method of composition of the most notable literary production
1756,X.,"of ancient Babylonia, it will be proper to consider the _literary_"
1757,X.,relationship of the old Babylonian to the Assyrian version.
1758,X.,
1759,X.,We have already referred to the different form in which the names
1760,X.,"of the chief figures appear in the old Babylonian version, dGish as"
1761,X.,"against dGish-gì(n)-mash, dEn-ki-du as against dEn-ki-dú, Hu-wa-wa"
1762,X.,"as against Hu(m)-ba-ba. Erech appears as _Uruk ribîtim_, ""Erech of"
1763,X.,"the Plazas,"" as against _Uruk supûri_, ""walled Erech"" (or ""Erech"
1764,X.,"within the walls""), in the Assyrian version. [130] These variations"
1765,X.,point to an _independent_ recension for the Assyrian revision; and
1766,X.,this conclusion is confirmed by a comparison of parallel passages in
1767,X.,"our two tablets with the Assyrian version, for such parallels rarely"
1768,X.,"extend to verbal agreements in details, and, moreover, show that the"
1769,X.,Assyrian version has been elaborated.
1770,X.,
1771,X.,"Beginning with the Pennsylvania tablet, column I is covered in the"
1772,X.,"Assyrian version by tablet I, 5, 25, to 6, 33, though, as pointed out"
1773,X.,"above, in the Assyrian version we have the anticipation of the dreams"
1774,X.,of Gilgamesh and their interpretation through their recital to Enkidu
1775,X.,"by his female companion, whereas in the old Babylonian version we"
1776,X.,have the dreams _directly_ given in a conversation between Gilgamesh
1777,X.,"and his mother. In the anticipation, there would naturally be some"
1778,X.,omissions. So lines 4-5 and 12-13 of the Pennsylvania tablet do not
1779,X.,"appear in the Assyrian version, but in their place is a line (I, 5,"
1780,X.,"35), to be restored to"
1781,X.,
1782,X.,
1783,X.,"""[I saw him and like] a woman I fell in love with him."""
1784,X.,
1785,X.,
1786,X.,which occurs in the old Babylonian version only in connection with
1787,X.,the second dream. The point is of importance as showing that in the
1788,X.,Babylonian version the first dream lays stress upon the omen of
1789,X.,"the falling meteor, as symbolizing the coming of Enkidu, whereas"
1790,X.,"the second dream more specifically reveals Enkidu as a man, [131]"
1791,X.,"of whom Gilgamesh is instantly enamored. Strikingly variant lines,"
1792,X.,"though conveying the same idea, are frequent. Thus line 14 of the"
1793,X.,Babylonian version reads
1794,X.,
1795,X.,
1796,X.,"""I bore it and carried it to thee"""
1797,X.,
1798,X.,
1799,X.,"and appears in the Assyrian version (I, 5, 35_b_ supplied from 6, 26)"
1800,X.,
1801,X.,
1802,X.,"""I threw it (or him) at thy feet"" [132]"
1803,X.,
1804,X.,
1805,X.,with an additional line in elaboration
1806,X.,
1807,X.,
1808,X.,"""Thou didst bring him into contact with me"" [133]"
1809,X.,
1810,X.,
1811,X.,which anticipates the speech of the mother
1812,X.,
1813,X.,
1814,X.,"(Line 41 = Assyrian version I, 6, 33)."
1815,X.,
1816,X.,
1817,X.,Line 10 of the Pennsylvania tablet has _pa-hi-ir_ as against _iz-za-az_
1818,"I, 5, 31.","I, 5, 31."
1819,"I, 5, 31.",
1820,"I, 5, 31.","Line 8 has _ik-ta-bi-it_ as against _da-an_ in the Assyrian version I,"
1821,"I, 5, 31.","5, 29."

1838,"I, 5, 31.",but this lack of correspondence is probably due to the fact that the
1839,"I, 5, 31.","Assyrian version represents the anticipation of the dreams which,"
1840,"I, 5, 31.","as already suggested, might well omit some details. As against this"
1841,"I, 5, 31.","we have in the Assyrian version I, 6, 23-25, an elaboration of line"
1842,"I, 5, 31.",30 in the Pennsylvania tablet and taken over from the recital of
1843,"I, 5, 31.","the first dream. Through the Assyrian version I, 6, 31-32, we can"
1844,"I, 5, 31.","restore the closing lines of column I of the Pennsylvania tablet,"
1845,"I, 5, 31.","while with line 33 = line 45 of the Pennsylvania tablet, the parallel"
1846,"I, 5, 31.",between the two versions comes to an end. Lines 34-43 of the Assyrian
1847,"I, 5, 31.",version (bringing tablet I to a close) [135] represent an elaboration
1848,"I, 5, 31.","of the speech of Ninsun, followed by a further address of Gilgamesh"
1849,"I, 5, 31.","to his mother, and by the determination of Gilgamesh to seek out"
1850,"I, 5, 31.",Enkidu. [136] Nothing of this sort appears to have been included in
1851,"I, 5, 31.",the old Babylonian version.Our text proceeds with the scene between
1852,"I, 5, 31.","Enkidu and the woman, in which the latter by her charms and her appeal"
1853,"I, 5, 31.",endeavors to lead Enkidu away from his life with the animals. From
1854,"I, 5, 31.",the abrupt manner in which the scene is introduced in line 43 of the
1855,"I, 5, 31.","Pennsylvania tablet, it is evident that this cannot be the _first_"
1856,"I, 5, 31.",mention of the woman. The meeting must have been recounted in the
1857,"I, 5, 31.","first tablet, as is the case in the Assyrian version. [137] The second"
1858,"I, 5, 31.",tablet takes up the direct recital of the dreams of Gilgamesh and
1859,"I, 5, 31.",then continues the narrative. Whether in the old Babylonian version
1860,"I, 5, 31.",the scene between Enkidu and the woman was described with the same
1861,"I, 5, 31.","naïve details, as in the Assyrian version, of the sexual intercourse"
1862,"I, 5, 31.",between the two for six days and seven nights cannot of course be
1863,"I, 5, 31.","determined, though presumably the Assyrian version, with the tendency"
1864,"I, 5, 31.","of epics to become more elaborate as they pass from age to age, added"
1865,"I, 5, 31.",some realistic touches. Assuming that lines 44-63 of the Pennsylvania
1866,"I, 5, 31.",tablet--the cohabitation of Enkidu and the address of the woman--is
1867,"I, 5, 31.","a repetition of what was already described in the first tablet, the"
1868,"I, 5, 31.","comparison with the Assyrian version I, 4, 16-41, not only points to"
1869,"I, 5, 31.","the elaboration of the later version, but likewise to an independent"
1870,"I, 5, 31.","recension, even where parallel lines can be picked out. Only lines"
1871,"I, 5, 31.",46-48 of the Pennsylvania tablet form a complete parallel to line 21
1872,"I, 5, 31.",of column 4 of the Assyrian version. The description in lines 22-32
1873,"I, 5, 31.","of column 4 is missing, though it may, of course, have been included"
1874,"I, 5, 31.",in part in the recital in the first tablet of the old Babylonian
1875,"I, 5, 31.","version. Lines 49-59 of the Pennsylvania tablet are covered by 33-39,"
1876,"I, 5, 31.",the only slight difference being the specific mention in line 58 of
1877,"I, 5, 31.","the Pennsylvania tablet of Eanna, the temple in Erech, described as"
1878,"I, 5, 31.","""the dwelling of Anu,"" whereas in the Assyrian version Eanna is merely"
1879,"I, 5, 31.","referred to as the ""holy house"" and described as ""the dwelling of"
1880,"I, 5, 31.","Anu and Ishtar,"" where Ishtar is clearly a later addition."
1881,"I, 5, 31.",
1882,"I, 5, 31.","Leaving aside lines 60-61, which may be merely a variant (though"
1883,"I, 5, 31.","independent) of line 39 of column 4 of the Assyrian version, we now"
1884,"I, 5, 31.",have in the Pennsylvania tablet a second speech of the woman to Enkidu
1885,"I, 5, 31.",(not represented in the Assyrian version) beginning like the first
1886,"I, 5, 31.","one with _alka_, ""Come"" (lines 62-63), in which she asks Enkidu to"
1887,"I, 5, 31.","leave the ""accursed ground"" in which he dwells. This speech, as the"
1888,"I, 5, 31.","description which follows, extending into columns 3-4, and telling how"
1889,"I, 5, 31.","the woman clothed Enkidu, how she brought him to the sheep folds, how"
1890,"I, 5, 31.","she taught him to eat bread and to drink wine, and how she instructed"
1891,"I, 5, 31.","him in the ways of civilization, must have been included in the second"
1892,"I, 5, 31.",tablet of the Assyrian version which has come down to us in a very
1893,"I, 5, 31.",imperfect form. Nor is the scene in which Enkidu and Gilgamesh have
1894,"I, 5, 31.",their encounter found in the preserved portions of the second (or
1895,"I, 5, 31.","possibly the third) tablet of the Assyrian version, but only a brief"
1896,"I, 5, 31.","reference to it in the fourth tablet, [138] in which in Epic style the"
1897,"I, 5, 31.","story is repeated, leading up to the second exploit--the joint campaign"
1898,"I, 5, 31.","of Enkidu and Gilgamesh against Huwawa. This reference, covering only"
1899,"I, 5, 31.","seven lines, corresponds to lines 192-231 of the Pennsylvania tablet;"
1900,"I, 5, 31.",but the former being the repetition and the latter the original
1901,"I, 5, 31.","recital, the comparison to be instituted merely reveals again the"

1950,"I, 5, 31.","of the Assyrian version, we would again have an illustration of the"
1951,"I, 5, 31.",elaboration of the later version by the addition of lines 3-6. But
1952,"I, 5, 31.",beyond this we have merely the comparison of the description of Huwawa

1970,"I, 5, 31.",It may be noted as a general point of resemblance in the exterior form

2598,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""wandering about in the midst of omens"" (misreading _id-da-tim _"

2645,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the old Babylonian version, for which in the Assyrian version we"
2646,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"have _Uruk su-pu-ri_. The former term suggests the ""broad space"""
2647,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"outside of the city or the ""common"" in a village community,"
2648,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"while _supûri_, ""enclosed,"" would refer to the city within the"
2649,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"walls. Dr. W. F. Albright (in a private communication) suggests ""Erech"
2650,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of the plazas"" as a suitable translation for _Uruk ribîtim_. A third"
2651,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"term, _Uruk mâtum_ (see above, note to line 10), though designating"
2652,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"rather the district of which Erech was the capital, appears to be"
2653,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"used as a synonym to _Uruk ribîtim_, as may be concluded from the"
2654,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"phrase _i-na ri-bi-tum ma-ti_ (l. 214 of the Pennsylvania tablet),"
2655,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"which clearly means the ""plaza"" of the city. One naturally thinks of"
2656,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"REHOBOT `IYR in Genesis 10, 11--the equivalent of Babylonian _ri-bi-tu"
2657,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,âli_--which can hardly be the name of a city. It appears to be a
2658,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"gloss, as is HIY' HO`IYR HAGEDOLOH at the end of v. 12. The latter"
2659,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"gloss is misplaced, since it clearly describes ""Nineveh,"" mentioned"
2660,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,in v. 11. Inasmuch as REHOBOT `IYR immediately follows the mention
2661,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of Nineveh, it seems simplest to take the phrase as designating the"
2662,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""outside"" or ""suburbs"" of the city, a complete parallel, therefore,"
2663,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to _ri-bi-tu mâti_ in our text. Nineveh, together with the ""suburbs,"""
2664,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"forms the ""great city."" _Uruk ribîtim_ is, therefore, a designation"
2665,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"for ""greater Erech,"" proper to a capital city, which by its gradual"
2666,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"growth would take in more than its original confines. ""Erech of the"
2667,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"plazas"" must have come to be used as a honorific designation of this"
2668,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"important center as early as 2000 B. C., whereas later, perhaps"
2669,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"because of its decline, the epithet no longer seemed appropriate"
2670,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"and was replaced by the more modest designation of ""walled Erech,"""
2671,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,with an allusion to the tradition which ascribed the building of the
2672,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"wall of the city to Gilgamesh. At all events, all three expressions,"
2673,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""Erech of the plazas,"" ""Erech walled"" and ""Erech land,"" are to be"
2674,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,regarded as synonymous. The position once held by Erech follows also
2675,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"from its ideographic designation (Brünnow No. 4796) by the sign ""house"""
2676,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"with a ""gunufied"" extension, which conveys the idea of Unu = _subtu_,"
2677,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"or ""dwelling"" _par excellence_. The pronunciation Unug or Unuk (see"
2678,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the gloss _u-nu-uk_, VR 23, 8a), composed of _unu_, ""dwelling,"" and"
2679,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_ki_, ""place,"" is hardly to be regarded as older than Uruk, which is"
2680,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to be resolved into _uru_, ""city,"" and _ki_, ""place,"" but rather as"
2681,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"a play upon the name, both Unu + ki and Uru + ki conveying the same"
2682,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,idea of _the_ city or _the_ dwelling place _par excellence_. As the
2683,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,seat of the second oldest dynasty according to Babylonian traditions
2684,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(see Poebel's list in _Historical and Grammatical Texts_ No. 2),"
2685,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Erech no doubt was regarded as having been at one time ""the city,"""
2686,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"i.e., the capital of the entire Euphrates Valley."
2687,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2688,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 31. A difficult line for which Langdon proposes the translation:
2689,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""Another axe seemed his visage""!!--which may be picturesque, but"
2690,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,hardly a description befitting a hero. How can a man's face seem
2691,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to be an axe? Langdon attaches _sá-ni_ in the sense of ""second"""
2692,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to the preceding word ""axe,"" whereas _sanî bunusu_, ""change of his"
2693,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"countenance"" or ""his countenance being changed,"" is to be taken as"
2694,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"a phrase to convey the idea of ""being disturbed,"" ""displeased"" or"
2695,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""angry."" The phrase is of the same kind as the well-known _sunnu"
2696,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"têmu_, ""changing of reason,"" to denote ""insanity."" See the passages"
2697,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, pp. 355 and 1068. In Hebrew,"
2698,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"too, we have the same two phrases, e.g., VAYESANOV 'ETTA`EMOV"
2699,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(I Sam. 21, 14 = Ps. 34, 1), ""and he changed his reason,"" i.e.,"
2700,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"feigned insanity and MESANEH PONOYV (Job 14, 20), ""changing his"
2701,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"face,"" to indicate a radical alteration in the frame of mind. There"
2702,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"is a still closer parallel in Biblical Aramaic: Dan. 3, 19, ""The form"
2703,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of his visage was changed,"" meaning ""he was enraged."" Fortunately,"
2704,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the same phrase occurs also in the Yale tablet (l. 192), _sá-nu-ú"
2705,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"bu-nu-sú_, in a connection which leaves no doubt that the aroused"
2706,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,fury of the tyrant Huwawa is described by it:
2707,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2708,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2709,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""Huwawa heard and his face was changed"""
2710,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2711,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2712,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"precisely, therefore, as we should say--following Biblical usage--""his"
2713,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"countenance fell."" Cf. also the phrase _pânusu arpu_, ""his countenance"
2714,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"was darkened"" (Assyrian version I, 2, 48), to express ""anger."" The"
2715,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"line, therefore, in the Pennsylvania tablet must describe Enkidu's"
2716,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,anger. With the brandishing of the axe the hero's anger was also
2717,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,stirred up. The touch was added to prepare us for the continuation
2718,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in which Gish describes how, despite this (or perhaps just because"
2719,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of it), Enkidu seemed so attractive that Gish instantly fell in love"
2720,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,with him. May perhaps the emphatic form _hasinumma_ (line 31) against
2721,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_hasinu_ (line 29) have been used to indicate ""The axe it was,"" or"
2722,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""because of the axe?"" It would be worth while to examine other texts"
2723,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of the Hammurabi period with a view of determining the scope in the

2754,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 44. The restoration of this line is largely conjectural, based"
2755,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"on the supposition that its contents correspond in a general way to I,"
2756,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"4, 16, of the Assyrian version. The reading _di-da_ is quite certain,"
2757,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,as is also _ip-ti-[e]_; and since both words occur in the line of the
2758,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Assyrian version in question, it is tempting to supply at the beginning"
2759,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_ur-[sá]_ = ""her loins"" (cf. Holma, _Namen der Körperteile_, etc.,"
2760,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"p. 101), which is likewise found in the same line of the Assyrian"
2761,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,version. At all events the line describes the fascination exercised
2762,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"upon Enkidu by the woman's bodily charms, which make him forget"
2763,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,everything else.
2764,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2765,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Lines 46-47 form a parallel to I, 4, 21, of the Assyrian version. The"

2767,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(ll. 135 and 172), as against _samhatu_ in the Assyrian version (I,"
2768,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"3, 19, 40, 45; 4, 16), which also uses the plural _sam-ha-a-ti_ (II,"

2782,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(present). The former is the better reading, as our tablet shows."
2783,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2784,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Lines 49-59 run parallel to the Assyrian version I, 4, 33-38,"
2785,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"with slight variations which have been discussed above, p. 58, and"
2786,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,from which we may conclude that the Assyrian version represents an
2787,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,independent redaction. Since in our tablet we have presumably the
2788,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,repetition of what may have been in part at least set forth in the
2789,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"first tablet of the old Babylonian version, we must not press the"
2790,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,parallelism with the first tablet of the Assyrian version too far;
2791,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,but it is noticeable nevertheless (1) that our tablet contains lines
2792,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"57-58 which are not represented in the Assyrian version, and (2) that"

2795,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,in the first tablet of the Assyrian version; which on the other
2796,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"hand contains a line (39) not in the Babylonian version, besides"
2797,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the detailed answer of Enkidu (I 4, 42-5, 5). Line 6, which reads"
2798,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""Enkidu and the woman went (_il-li-ku_) to walled Erech,"" is also"
2799,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,not found in the second tablet of the old Babylonian version.

2804,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"two words _ma-a-ak_ and _ri-i-im_, with a still stranger rendering:"
2805,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""unto the place yonder of the shepherds!!"", naturally misses the"
2806,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,point of this important speech.
2807,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2808,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 64 corresponds to I, 4, 40, of the Assyrian version, which has"
2809,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"an additional line, leading to the answer of Enkidu. From here on,"
2810,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"our tablet furnishes material not represented in the Assyrian version,"
2811,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,but which was no doubt included in the second tablet of that version
2812,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of which we have only a few fragments.
2813,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2814,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 70 must be interpreted as indicating that the woman kept one
2815,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"garment for herself. _Ittalbas_ would accordingly mean, ""she kept"
2816,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"on."" The female dress appears to have consisted of an upper and a"
2817,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,lower garment.
2818,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2819,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 72. The restoration ""like a god"" is favored by line 51, where"
2820,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Enkidu is likened to a god, and is further confirmed by l. 190."
2821,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2822,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 73. _gupru_ is identical with _gu-up-ri_ (Thompson, _Reports of"

2824,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"must be correlated to _gipâru_ (Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_,"

2826,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"translation ""men"" (as though a synonym of _gabru_) is to be corrected"
2827,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,accordingly.
2828,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2829,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 74. There is nothing missing between _a-sar_ and _tar-ba-si-im_.
2830,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2831,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 75. _ri-ia-ú_, which Langdon renders ""shepherd,"" is the"
2832,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"equivalent of the Arabic _ri'y_ and Hebrew RE`IY ""pasturage,"""
2833,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""fodder."" We have usually the feminine form _ri-i-tu_ (Muss-Arnolt,"
2834,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 990b). The break at the end of the second"
2835,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"column is not serious. Evidently Enkidu, still accustomed to live"
2836,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"like an animal, is first led to the sheepfolds, and this suggests"
2837,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,a repetition of the description of his former life. Of the four or
2838,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"five lines missing, we may conjecturally restore four, on the basis"
2839,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 4, 2-5, or I, 2, 39-41. This would"
2840,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,then join on well to the beginning of column 3.
2841,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2842,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 81. Both here and in l. 52 our text has _na-ma-ás-te-e_, as"

2844,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"2, 41; 4, 5, etc.,--the feminine form, therefore, as against the"
2845,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,masculine. Langdon's note 3 on page 213 is misleading. In astrological
2846,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"texts we also find _nam-mas-te_; e.g., Thompson, _Reports of the"
2847,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Magicians and Astrologers_, etc., No. 200, Obv. 2."
2848,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2849,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 93. _zi-ma-at_ (for _simat_) _ba-la-ti-im_ is not ""conformity of"

2884,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 103. Langdon has correctly rendered _suhuru_ as ""hair,"" and"

2892,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"that we have _suhuru_ (introduced as a loan-word) for the barbershop,"

2904,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"tempted, furthermore, to see in the difficult word SKYRH (Isaiah 7,"
2905,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"20) a loan-word from our _suhuru_, and to take the words 'ETHORO'S"
2906,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"VESA`AR HORAGELAYIM ""the head and hair of the feet"" (euphemistic"
2907,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"for the hair around the privates), as an explanatory gloss to the rare"
2908,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"word Skyrh for ""hair"" of the body in general--just as in the passage"
2909,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in the Pennsylvania tablet. The verse in Isaiah would then read,"
2910,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""The Lord on that day will shave with the razor the hair (HSKYRH),"
2911,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"and even the beard will be removed."" The rest of the verse would"
2912,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"represent a series of explanatory glosses: (a) ""Beyond the river"""
2913,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(i.e., Assyria), a gloss to YEGALAH (b) ""with the king of Assyria,"""
2914,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"a gloss to BETA`AR ""with a razor;"" and (c) ""the hair of the head and"
2915,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"hair of the feet,"" a gloss to HSKYRH. For ""hair of the feet"" we have an"
2916,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,interesting equivalent in Babylonian _su-hur_ (and _sú-hu-ur_) _sêpi_
2917,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(_CT_ XII, 41, 23-24 c-d). Cf. also Boissier, _Documents Assyriens"
2918,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"relatifs aux Présages_, p. 258, 4-5. The Babylonian phrase is like the"
2919,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Hebrew one to be interpreted as a euphemism for the hair around the
2920,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"male or female organ. To be sure, the change from H to K in HSKYRH"
2921,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"constitutes an objection, but not a serious one in the case of a"
2922,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"loan-word, which would aim to give the _pronunciation_ of the original"
2923,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"word, rather than the correct etymological equivalent. The writing with"
2924,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"aspirated K fulfills this condition. (Cf. _samkatum_ and _samhatum_,"
2925,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"above p. 73). The passage in Isaiah being a reference to Assyria,"
2926,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,the prophet might be tempted to use a foreign word to make his point
2927,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"more emphatic. To take HSKYRH as ""hired,"" as has hitherto been done,"
2928,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"and to translate ""with a hired razor,"" is not only to suppose a very"
2929,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"wooden metaphor, but is grammatically difficult, since HSKYRH would"
2930,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,be a feminine adjective attached to a masculine substantive.
2931,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2932,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Coming back to our passage in the Pennsylvania tablet, it is to be"

2943,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,separating _ú_ from _gi-ir-ri_ gets a totally wrong and indeed absurd
2944,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,meaning. See the corrections in the Appendix. He takes the sign _ú_

2962,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 113. Langdon's translation is again out of the question and
2963,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"purely fanciful. The traces favor the restoration _na-ki-[di-e]_,"

2968,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the Assyrian version (tablet II, 3a, 4) Enkidu is called a _na-kid_,"

2987,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,quite possible that in line 2 we must read _sib-ba-ri_ (instead
2988,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of _bar-ba-ri_), which would furnish a parallel to line 111 of the"
2989,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Pennsylvania tablet. The difference between Bar and Sib is slight,"
2990,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,and the one sign might easily be mistaken for the other in the case
2991,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of close writing. The continuation of line 2 of the fragment would
2992,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"then correspond to line 112 of the Pennsylvania tablet, while line 1"
2993,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of the fragment might be completed _[re-e]-u-ti(?) sá [mu-si-a-tim]_,"
2994,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,though this is by no means certain.
2995,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
2996,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,The break at the close of column 3 (about 5 lines) and the top
2997,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of column 4 (about 8 lines) is a most serious interruption in the
2998,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"narrative, and makes it difficult to pick up the thread where the"
2999,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"tablet again becomes readable. We cannot be certain whether the ""strong"
3000,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"man, the unique hero"" who addresses some one (lines 115-117) is Enkidu"
3001,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"or Gish or some other personage, but presumably Gish is meant. In the"
3002,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Assyrian version, Tablet I, 3, 2 and 29, we find Gilgamesh described"
3003,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"as the ""unique hero"" and in l. 234 of the Pennsylvania tablet Gish"
3004,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"is called ""unique,"" while again, in the Assyrian version, Tablet I,"
3005,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"2, 15 and 26, he is designated as _gasru_ as in our text. Assuming"
3006,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"this, whom does he address? Perhaps the shepherds? In either case"
3007,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,he receives an answer that rejoices him. If the fragment of the
3008,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Assyrian version (K 8574) above discussed is the equivalent to the
3009,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"close of column 3 of the Pennsylvania tablet, we may go one step"
3010,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"further, and with some measure of assurance assume that Gish is told"
3011,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of Enkidu's exploits and that the latter is approaching Erech. This
3012,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"pleases Gish, but Enkidu when he sees Gish(?) is stirred to anger and"
3013,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"wants to annihilate him. At this point, the ""man"" (who is probably"
3014,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Gish, though the possibility of a third personage must be admitted)"
3015,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,intervenes and in a long speech sets forth the destiny and higher aims
3016,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of mankind. The contrast between Enkidu and Gish (or the third party)
3017,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,is that between the primitive savage and the civilized being. The
3018,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,contrast is put in the form of an opposition between the two. The
3019,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,primitive man is the stronger and wishes to destroy the one whom he
3020,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"regards as a natural foe and rival. On the other hand, the one who"
3021,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,stands on a higher plane wants to lift his fellow up. The whole of
3022,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"column 4, therefore, forms part of the lesson attached to the story"
3023,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of Enkidu, who, identified with man in a primitive stage, is made the"
3024,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,medium of illustrating how the higher plane is reached through the
3025,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"guiding influences of the woman's hold on man, an influence exercised,"
3026,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to be sure, with the help of her bodily charms."
3027,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3028,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 135. _uk-ki-si_ (imperative form) does not mean ""take away,"" as"
3029,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Langdon (who entirely misses the point of the whole passage) renders,"
3030,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"but on the contrary, ""lure him on,"" ""entrap him,"" and the like. The"
3031,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"verb occurs also in the Yale tablet, ll. 183 and 186."
3032,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3033,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 137. Langdon's note to _lu-us-sú_ had better be passed over in
3034,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"silence. The form is II. 1, from _esû_, ""destroy."""
3035,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3036,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 139. Since the man whom the woman calls approaches Enkidu, the"
3037,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"subject of both verbs is the man, and the object is Enkidu; i.e.,"
3038,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"therefore, ""The man approaches Enkidu and beholds him."""
3039,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3040,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 140. Langdon's interpretation of this line again is purely
3041,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"fanciful. _E-di-il_ cannot, of course, be a ""phonetic variant"""
3042,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of _edir_; and certainly the line does not describe the state of
3043,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,mind of the woman. Lines 140-141 are to be taken as an expression
3044,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of amazement at Enkidu's appearance. The first word appears to be
3045,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"an imperative in the sense of ""Be off,"" ""Away,"" from _dâlu_, ""move,"
3046,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"roam."" The second word _e-es_, ""why,"" occurs with the same verb _dâlu_"
3047,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in the Meissner fragment: _e-es ta-da-al_ (column 3, 1), ""why dost thou"
3048,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"roam about?"" The verb at the end of the line may perhaps be completed"
3049,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to _ta-hi-il-la-am_. The last sign appears to be _am_, but may be _ma_,"
3050,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,in which case we should have to complete simply _ta-hi-il-ma_. _Tahîl_
3051,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"would be the second person present of _hîlu_. Cf. _i-hi-il_, frequently"
3052,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in astrological texts, e.g., Virolleaud, _Adad_ No. 3, lines 21 and 33."
3053,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3054,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 141. The reading _lim-nu_ at the beginning, instead of Langdon's"
3055,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_mi-nu_, is quite certain, as is also _ma-na-ah-ti-ka_ instead of"
3056,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"what Langdon proposes, which gives no sense whatever. _Manahtu_ in"
3057,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the sense of the ""toil"" and ""activity of life"" (like `OMOL throughout"
3058,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,the Book of Ecclesiastes) occurs in the introductory lines to the
3059,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Assyrian version of the Epic I, 1, 8, _ka-lu ma-na-ah-ti-[su]_,"
3060,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""all of his toil,"" i.e., all of his career."
3061,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3062,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 142. The subject of the verb cannot be the woman, as Langdon"
3063,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"supposes, for the text in that case, e.g., line 49, would have said"
3064,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_pi-sá_ (""her mouth"") not _pi-sú_ (""his mouth""). The long speech,"
3065,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"detailing the function and destiny of civilized man, is placed in"
3066,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,the mouth of the man who meets Enkidu.
3067,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3068,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,In the Introduction it has been pointed out that lines 149 and 151
3069,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of the speech appear to be due to later modifications of the speech
3070,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,designed to connect the episode with Gish. Assuming this to be the
3071,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"case, the speech sets forth the following five distinct aims of"
3072,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"human life: (1) establishing a home (line 144), (2) work (line 147),"
3073,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(3) storing up resources (line 148), (4) marriage (line 150), (5)"
3074,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,monogamy (line 154); all of which is put down as established for all
3075,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"time by divine decree (lines 155-157), and as man's fate from his birth"
3076,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,(lines 158-159).
3077,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3078,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 144. _bi-ti-is e-mu-ti_ is for _bîti sá e-mu-ti_, just as"
3079,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_kab-lu-us Ti-a-ma-ti_ (Assyrian Creation Myth, IV, 65) stands for"
3080,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_kablu sá Tiamti_. Cf. _bît e-mu-ti_ (Assyrian version, IV, 2, 46"
3081,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"and 48). The end of the line is lost beyond recovery, but the general"
3082,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,sense is clear.
3083,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3084,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 146. _tu-a-ar_ is a possible reading. It may be the construct
3085,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of _tu-a-ru_, of frequent occurrence in legal texts and having some"
3086,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"such meaning as ""right,"" ""claim"" or ""prerogative."" See the passages"
3087,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"given by Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 1139b."
3088,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3089,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 148. The reading _uk-la-at_, ""food,"" and then in the wider"
3090,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"sense ""food supply,"" ""provisions,"" is quite certain. The fourth sign"
3091,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"looks like the one for ""city."" _E-mi-sa_ may stand for _e-mid-sa_,"
3092,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""place it."" The general sense of the line, at all events, is clear, as"
3093,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,giving the advice to gather resources. It fits in with the Babylonian
3094,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,outlook on life to regard work and wealth as the fruits of work and
3095,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,as a proper purpose in life.
3096,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3097,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 150 (repeated lines 152-153) is a puzzling line. To render _piti
3098,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"pûk epsi_ (or _episi_), as Langdon proposes, ""open, addressing thy"
3099,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"speech,"" is philologically and in every other respect inadmissible. The"
3100,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"word _pu-uk_ (which Langdon takes for ""thy mouth""!!) can, of course,"
3101,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"be nothing but the construct form of _pukku_, which occurs in the"
3102,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Assyrian version in the sense of ""net"" (_pu-uk-ku_ I, 2, 9 and"
3103,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"21, and also in the colophon to the eleventh tablet furnishing the"
3104,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"beginning of the twelfth tablet (Haupt's edition No. 56), as well as"
3105,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in column 2, 29, and column 3, 6, of this twelfth tablet). In the two"
3106,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"last named passages _pukku_ is a synonym of _mekû_, which from the"
3107,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"general meaning of ""enclosure"" comes to be a euphemistic expression"
3108,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"for the female organ. So, for example, in the Assyrian Creation Myth,"
3109,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Tablet IV, 66 (synonym of _kablu_, ""waist,"" etc.). See Holma, _Namen"
3110,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"der Körperteile_, page 158. Our word _pukku_ must be taken in this same"
3111,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,sense as a designation of the female organ--perhaps more specifically
3112,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the ""hymen"" as the ""net,"" though the womb in general might also be"
3113,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"designated as a ""net"" or ""enclosure."" _Kak-(si)_ is no doubt to be"
3114,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"read _epsi_, as Langdon correctly saw; or perhaps better, _episi_. An"
3115,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"expression like _ip-si-sú lul-la-a_ (Assyrian version, I, 4, 13;"
3116,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"also line 19, _i-pu-us-su-ma lul-la-a_), with the explanation _sipir"
3117,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"zinnisti_, ""the work of woman"" (i.e., after the fashion of woman),"
3118,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,shows that _epêsu_ is used in connection with the sexual act. The
3119,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"phrase _pitî pûk episi a-na ha-a-a-ri_, literally ""open the net,"
3120,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"perform the act for marriage,"" therefore designates the fulfillment"
3121,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of the marriage act, and the line is intended to point to marriage"
3122,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,with the accompanying sexual intercourse as one of the duties of
3123,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"man. While the general meaning is thus clear, the introduction of"
3124,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Gish is puzzling, except on the supposition that lines 149 and 151"
3125,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"represent later additions to connect the speech, detailing the advance"
3126,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to civilized life, with the hero. See above, p. 45 _seq._"
3127,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3128,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 154. _assat simâtim_ is the ""legitimate wife,"" and the line"
3129,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,inculcates monogamy as against promiscuous sexual intercourse. We know
3130,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"that monogamy was the rule in Babylonia, though a man could in addition"
3131,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to the wife recognized as the legalized spouse take a concubine, or"
3132,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,his wife could give her husband a slave as a concubine. Even in that
3133,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"case, according to the Hammurabi Code, §§145-146, the wife retained"
3134,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,her status. The Code throughout assumes that a man has only _one_
3135,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"wife--the _assat simâtim_ of our text. The phrase ""so"" (or ""that"")"
3136,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"before ""as afterwards"" is to be taken as an idiomatic expression--""so"
3137,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"it was and so it should be for all times""--somewhat like the phrase"
3138,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_mahriam ù arkiam_, ""for all times,"" in legal documents (_CT_ VIII,"
3139,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"38c, 22-23). For the use of _mûk_ see Behrens, _Assyrisch-Babylonische"
3140,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Briefe_, p. 3."
3141,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3142,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 158. _i-na bi-ti-ik a-bu-un-na-ti-sú_. Another puzzling line,"
3143,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"for which Langdon proposes ""in the work of his presence,"" which is"
3144,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,as obscure as the original. In a note he says that _apunnâti_ means
3145,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""nostrils,"" which is certainly wrong. There has been considerable"
3146,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"discussion about this term (see Holma, _Namen der Körperteile_,"
3147,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"pages 150 and 157), the meaning of which has been advanced by"
3148,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Christian's discussion in _OLZ_ 1914, p. 397. From this it appears"
3149,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,that it must designate a part of the body which could acquire a wider
3150,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"significance so as to be used as a synonym for ""totality,"" since it"
3151,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"appears in a list of equivalent for Dur = _nap-ha-ru_, ""totality,"""
3152,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_ka-lu-ma_, ""all,"" _a-bu-un-na-tum e-si-im-tum_, ""bony structure,"" and"
3153,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_kul-la-tum_, ""totality"" (_CT_ XII, 10, 7-10). Christian shows that"
3154,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"it may be the ""navel,"" which could well acquire a wider significance"
3155,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,for the body in general; but we may go a step further and specify
3156,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the ""umbilical cord"" (tentatively suggested also by Christian) as"
3157,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the primary meaning, then the ""navel,"" and from this the ""body"" in"
3158,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,general. The structure of the umbilical cord as a series of strands
3159,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"would account for designating it by a plural form _abunnâti_, as"
3160,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,also for the fact that one could speak of a right and left side of
3161,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the _appunnâti_. To distinguish between the ""umbilical cord"" and the"
3162,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""navel,"" the ideograph Dur (the common meaning of which is _riksu_,"
3163,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""bond"" [Delitzsch, _Sumer. Glossar._, p. 150]), was used for the"
3164,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"former, while for the latter Li Dur was employed, though the reading"
3165,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in Akkadian in both cases was the same. The expression ""with (or at)"
3166,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the cutting of his umbilical cord"" would mean, therefore, ""from"
3167,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"his birth""--since the cutting of the cord which united the child"
3168,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,with the mother marks the beginning of the separate life. Lines
3169,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"158-159, therefore, in concluding the address to Enkidu, emphasize"
3170,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,in a picturesque way that what has been set forth is man's fate for
3171,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,which he has been destined from birth. [See now Albright's remarks on
3172,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_abunnatu_ in the Revue d'Assyriologie 16, pp. 173-175, with whose"
3173,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"conclusion, however, that it means primarily ""backbone"" and then"
3174,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""stature,"" I cannot agree.]"
3175,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3176,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"In the break of about three lines at the bottom of column 4, and"
3177,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of about six at the beginning of column 5, there must have been set"
3178,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,forth the effect of the address on Enkidu and the indication of his
3179,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"readiness to accept the advice; as in a former passage (line 64),"
3180,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Enkidu showed himself willing to follow the woman. At all events the
3181,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,two now proceed to the heart of the city. Enkidu is in front and
3182,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,the woman behind him. The scene up to this point must have taken
3183,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"place outside of Erech--in the suburbs or approaches to the city,"
3184,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,where the meadows and the sheepfolds were situated.
3185,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3186,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 174. _um-ma-nu-um_ are not the ""artisans,"" as Langdon supposes,"
3187,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"but the ""people"" of Erech, just as in the Assyrian version, Tablet"
3188,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"IV, 1, 40, where the word occurs in connection with _i-dip-pi-ir_,"
3189,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"which is perhaps to be taken as a synonym of _pahâru_, ""gather;"""
3190,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"so also _i-dip-pir_ (Tablet I, 2, 40) ""gathers with the flock."""
3191,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3192,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Lines 180-182 must have contained the description of Enkidu's
3193,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"resemblance to Gish, but the lines are too mutilated to permit of any"
3194,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,certain restoration. See the corrections (Appendix) for a suggested
3195,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,reading for the end of line 181.
3196,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3197,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 183 can be restored with considerable probability on the basis of
3198,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the Assyrian version, Tablet I, 3, 3 and 30, where Enkidu is described"
3199,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"as one ""whose power is strong in the land."""
3200,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3201,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Lines 186-187. The puzzling word, to be read apparently _kak-ki-a-tum_,"
3202,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"can hardly mean ""weapons,"" as Langdon proposes. In that case we"
3203,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"should expect _kakkê_; and, moreover, to so render gives no sense,"
3204,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,especially since the verb _ú-te-el-li-lu_ is without much question
3205,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to be rendered ""rejoiced,"" and not ""purified."" _Kakkiatum_--if this"
3206,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,be the correct reading--may be a designation of Erech like _ribîtim_.
3207,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3208,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Lines 188-189 are again entirely misunderstood by Langdon, owing to"
3209,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,erroneous readings. See the corrections in the Appendix.
3210,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,

3214,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3215,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 192. With this line a new episode begins which, owing to the gap"
3216,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"at the beginning of column 6, is somewhat obscure. The episode leads"
3217,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,to the hostile encounter between Gish and Enkidu. It is referred
3218,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,to in column 2 of the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version. Lines
3219,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,35-50--all that is preserved of this column--form in part a parallel
3220,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"to columns 5-6 of the Pennsylvania tablet, but in much briefer form,"
3221,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,since what on the Pennsylvania tablet is the incident itself is on
3222,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,the fourth tablet of the Assyrian version merely a repeated summary of
3223,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the relationship between the two heroes, leading up to the expedition"
3224,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,against Hu(m)baba. Lines 38-40 of column 2 of the Assyrian version
3225,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"correspond to lines 174-177 of the Pennsylvania tablet, and lines"
3226,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,44-50 to lines 192-221. It would seem that Gish proceeds stealthily
3227,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"at night to go to the goddess Ishhara, who lies on a couch in the _bît"

3231,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,and thus prevents Gish from entering. Thereupon the two have a fierce
3232,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,encounter in which Gish is worsted. The meaning of the episode itself
3233,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"is not clear. Does Enkidu propose to deprive Gish, here viewed as a god"
3234,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(cf. line 190 of the Pennsylvania tablet = Assyrian version, Tablet"
3235,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"I, 4, 45, ""like a god""), of his spouse, the goddess Ishhara--another"
3236,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"form of Ishtar? Or are the two heroes, the one a counterpart of the"
3237,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"other, contesting for the possession of a goddess? Is it in this"
3238,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"scene that Enkidu becomes the ""rival"" (_me-ih-rù_, line 191 of the"
3239,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Pennsylvania tablet) of the divine Gish? We must content ourself with
3240,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,having obtained through the Pennsylvania tablet a clearer indication
3241,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"of the occasion of the fight between the two heroes, and leave the"
3242,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,further explanation of the episode till a fortunate chance may throw
3243,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,additional light upon it. There is perhaps a reference to the episode
3244,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in the Assyrian version, Tablet II, 3b, 35-36."
3245,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3246,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 196. For _i-na-ag-sá-am_ (from _nagâsu_), Langdon proposes the"
3247,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"purely fanciful ""embracing her in sleep,"" whereas it clearly means"

3249,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3250,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Lines 197-200 appear to correspond to Tablet IV, 2, 35-37, of the"
3251,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Assyrian version, though not forming a complete parallel. We may"
3252,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,therefore supply at the beginning of line 35 of the Assyrian version
3253,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_[ittaziz] Enkidu_, corresponding to line 197 of the Pennsylvania"
3254,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"tablet. Line 36 of IV, 2, certainly appears to correspond to line 200"
3255,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,(_dan-nu-ti_ = _da-na-ni-is-sú_).
3256,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3257,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 208. The first sign looks more like _sar_, though _ur_ is"
3258,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,possible.
3259,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3260,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 211 is clearly a description of Enkidu, as is shown by a"
3261,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"comparison with the Assyrian version I, 2, 37: _[pi]-ti-ik pi-ir-ti-sú"
3262,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"uh-tan-na-ba kima d_Nidaba, ""The form of his hair sprouted like"
3263,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"wheat."" We must therefore supply Enkidu in the preceding line. Tablet"
3264,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"IV, 4, 6, of the Assyrian version also contains a reference to the"
3265,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,flowing hair of Enkidu.
3266,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3267,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 212. For the completion of the line cf. Harper, _Assyrian and"

3269,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3270,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 214. For _ribîtu mâti_ see the note above to line 28 of column 1.
3271,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3272,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Lines 215-217 correspond almost entirely to the Assyrian version IV, 2,"
3273,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"46-48. The variations _ki-ib-su_ in place of _sêpu_, and _kima lîm_,"
3274,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"""like oxen,"" instead of _ina bâb êmuti_ (repeated from line 46), _ana"
3275,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"surûbi_ for _êribam_, are slight though interesting. The Assyrian"

3278,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3279,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Lines 218-228. The detailed description of the fight between the two
3280,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,heroes is only partially preserved in the Assyrian version.
3281,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3282,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 218. _li-i-im_ is evidently to be taken as plural here as
3283,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in line 224, just as _su-ki-im_ (lines 27 and 175), _ri-bi-tim_"
3284,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(lines 4, 28, etc.), _tarbasim_ (line 74), _assamim_ (line 98) are"
3285,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"plural forms. Our text furnishes, as does also the Yale tablet, an"
3286,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,interesting illustration of the vacillation in the Hammurabi period
3287,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,in the twofold use of _im_: (a) as an indication of the plural (as in
3288,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Hebrew), and (b) as a mere emphatic ending (lines 63, 73, and 232),"
3289,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,which becomes predominant in the post-Hammurabi age.
3290,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3291,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 227. Gilgamesh is often represented on seal cylinders as kneeling,"
3292,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"e.g., Ward Seal Cylinders Nos. 159, 160, 165. Cf. also Assyrian version"
3293,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"V, 3, 6, where Gilgamesh is described as kneeling, though here in"
3294,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"prayer. See further the commentary to the Yale tablet, line 215."
3295,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3296,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 229. We must of course read _uz-za-sú_, ""his anger,"" and not"
3297,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_us-sa-sú_, ""his javelin,"" as Langdon does, which gives no sense."
3298,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3299,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 231. Langdon's note is erroneous. He again misses the point. The
3300,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"stem of the verb here as in line 230 (_i-ni-ih_) is the common _nâhu_,"
3301,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"used so constantly in connection with _pasâhu_, to designate the"
3302,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,cessation of anger.
3303,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3304,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 234. _istên_ applied to Gish designates him of course as ""unique,"""
3305,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"not as ""an ordinary man,"" as Langdon supposes."
3306,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3307,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 236. On this title ""wild cow of the stall"" for Ninsun, see Poebel"
3308,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in _OLZ_ 1914, page 6, to whom we owe the correct view regarding the"
3309,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,name of Gilgamesh's mother.
3310,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3311,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"Line 238. _mu-ti_ here cannot mean ""husband,"" but ""man"" in general. See"
3312,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,above note to line 107. Langdon's strange misreading _ri-es-su_ for
3313,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_ri-es-ka_ (""thy head"") leads him again to miss the point, namely"
3314,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,that Enkidu comforts his rival by telling him that he is destined for
3315,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,a career above that of the ordinary man. He is to be more than a mere
3316,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"prize fighter; he is to be a king, and no doubt in the ancient sense,"
3317,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,as the representative of the deity. This is indicated by the statement
3318,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"that the kingship is decreed for him by Enlil. Similarly, Hu(m)baba or"
3319,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Huwawa is designated by Enlil to inspire terror among men (Assyrian
3320,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"version, Tablet IV, 5, 2 and 5), _i-sim-sú d_Enlil = Yale tablet,"
3321,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"l. 137, where this is to be supplied. This position accorded to Enlil"
3322,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"is an important index for the origin of the Epic, which is thus shown"
3323,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,to date from a period when the patron deity of Nippur was acknowledged
3324,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,as the general head of the pantheon. This justifies us in going back
3325,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,several centuries at least before Hammurabi for the beginning of
3326,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the Gilgamesh story. If it had originated in the Hammurabi period,"
3327,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,we should have had Marduk introduced instead of Enlil.
3328,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,
3329,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,Line 242. As has been pointed out in the corrections to the text
3330,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"(Appendix), _sú-tu-ur_ can only be III, 1, from _atâru_, ""to be in"
3331,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"excess of."" It is a pity that the balance of the line is broken off,"
3332,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,since this is the first instance of a colophon beginning with the
3333,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,term in question. In some way _sutûr_ must indicate that the copy of
3334,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"the text has been ""enlarged."" It is tempting to fill out the line"
3335,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"_sú-tu-ur e-li [duppi labiri]_, and to render ""enlarged from an"
3336,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"original,"" as an indication of an independent recension of the Epic"
3337,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,"in the Hammurabi period. All this, however, is purely conjectural,"
3338,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,and we must patiently hope for more tablets of the Old Babylonian
3339,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,version to turn up. The chances are that some portions of the same
3340,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,edition as the Yale and Pennsylvania tablets are in the hands of
3341,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,dealers at present or have been sold to European museums. The war has
3342,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,seriously interfered with the possibility of tracing the whereabouts
3343,COMMENTARY ON THE PENNSYLVANIA TABLET.,of groups of tablets that ought never to have been separated.

4032,L.E.,"to designate a terror of the largest and most widespread character,"
4033,L.E.,is interesting. The number 7 is similarly used as a designation of
4034,L.E.,"Gilgamesh, who is called _Esigga imin_, ""seven-fold strong,"" i.e.,"
4035,L.E.,"supremely strong (CT XVIII, 30, 6-8). Similarly, Enkidu, _ib._ line"
4036,L.E.,"10, is designated _a-rá imina_, ""seven-fold."""
4037,L.E.,
4038,L.E.,Line 149. A difficult line because of the uncertainty of the reading
4039,L.E.,at the beginning of the following line. The most obvious meaning of
4040,L.E.,"_mi-it-tu_ is ""corpse,"" though in the Assyrian version _salamtu_"
4041,L.E.,"is used (Assyrian version, Tablet V, 2, 42). On the other hand,"
4042,L.E.,"it is possible--as Dr. Lutz suggested to me--that _mittu_, despite"
4043,L.E.,"the manner of writing, is identical with _mittú_, the name of a"
4044,L.E.,"divine weapon, well-known from the Assyrian creation myth (Tablet"
4045,L.E.,"IV, 130), and other passages. The combination _mit-tu sá-ku-ú-_,"
4046,L.E.,"""lofty weapon,"" in the Bilingual text IV, R2, 18 No. 3, 31-32, would"
4047,L.E.,"favor the meaning ""weapon"" in our passage, since _[sá]-ku-tu_ is a"
4048,L.E.,"possible restoration at the beginning of line 150. However, the writing"
4049,L.E.,"_mi-it-ti_ points too distinctly to a derivative of the stem _mâtu_,"
4050,L.E.,"and until a satisfactory explanation of lines 150-152 is forthcoming,"
4051,L.E.,"we must stick to the meaning ""corpse"" and read the verb _il-ku-ut_."
4052,L.E.,
4053,L.E.,"Line 152. The context suggests ""lion"" for the puzzling _la-bu_."
4054,L.E.,
4055,L.E.,Line 156. Another puzzling line. Dr. Clay's copy is an accurate
4056,L.E.,reproduction of what is distinguishable. At the close of the line
4057,L.E.,there appears to be a sign written over an erasure.
4058,L.E.,
4059,L.E.,"Line 158. _[ga-ti lu-]us-kun_ as in line 186, literally, ""I will"

4062,L.E.,Line 160. The restoration on the basis of the parallel line 187. Note
4063,L.E.,"the interesting phrase, ""writing a name"" in the sense of acquiring"
4064,L.E.,"""fame."""
4065,L.E.,
4066,L.E.,"Line 161. The _kiskattê_, ""artisans,"" are introduced also in the"
4067,L.E.,"Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 187, to look at the enormous size and"
4068,L.E.,weight of the horns of the slain divine bull. See for other passages
4069,L.E.,"Muss-Arnolt _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 450b. At the beginning of this"
4070,L.E.,"line, we must seek for the same word as in line 163."
4071,L.E.,
4072,L.E.,"Line 162. While the restoration _belê_, ""weapon,"" is purely"
4073,L.E.,"conjectural, the context clearly demands some such word. I choose"
4074,L.E.,"_belê_ in preference to _kakkê_, in view of the Assyrian version,"
4075,L.E.,"Tablet VI, 1."
4076,L.E.,
4077,L.E.,Line 163. _Putuku_ (or _putukku_) from _patâku_ would be an appropriate
4078,L.E.,word for the fabrication of weapons.
4079,L.E.,
4080,L.E.,"Line 165. The _rabûtim_ here, as in line 167, I take as the ""master"
4081,L.E.,"mechanics"" as contrasted with the _ummianu_, ""common workmen,"" or"
4082,L.E.,journeymen. A parallel to this forging of the weapons for the two
4083,L.E.,heroes is to be found in the Sumerian fragment of the Gilgamesh Epic
4084,L.E.,"published by Langdon, _Historical and Religious Texts from the Temple"
4085,L.E.,"Library of Nippur_ (Munich, 1914), No. 55, 1-15."
4086,L.E.,
4087,L.E.,Lines 168-170 describe the forging of the various parts of the
4088,L.E.,"lances for the two heroes. The _sipru_ is the spear point Muss-Arnolt,"
4089,L.E.,"_Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 886b; the _isid patri_ is clearly the ""hilt,"""
4090,L.E.,"and the _meselitum_ I therefore take as the ""blade"" proper. The word"
4091,L.E.,"occurs here for the first time, so far as I can see. For 30 minas,"
4092,L.E.,"see Assyrian version, Tablet VI, 189, as the weight of the two horns"
4093,L.E.,"of the divine bull. Each axe weighing 3 _biltu_, and the lance with"
4094,L.E.,point and hilt 3 _biltu_ we would have to assume 4 _biltu_ for each
4095,L.E.,"_pasu_, so as to get a total of 10 _biltu_ as the weight of the weapons"
4096,L.E.,for each hero. The lance is depicted on seal cylinders representing
4097,L.E.,"Gilgamesh and Enkidu, for example, Ward, _Seal Cylinders_, No. 199,"
4098,L.E.,"and also in Nos. 184 and 191 in the field, with the broad hilt;"
4099,L.E.,and in an enlarged form in No. 648. Note the clear indication of the
4100,L.E.,"hilt. The two figures are Gilgamesh and Enkidu--not two Gilgameshes,"
4101,L.E.,"as Ward assumed. See above, page 34. A different weapon is the club or"
4102,L.E.,"mace, as seen in Ward, Nos. 170 and 173. This appears also to be the"
4103,L.E.,weapon which Gilgamesh holds in his hand on the colossal figure from
4104,L.E.,"the palace of Sargon (Jastrow, _Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria_,"
4105,L.E.,"Pl. LVII), though it has been given a somewhat grotesque character by"
4106,L.E.,"a perhaps intentional approach to the scimitar, associated with Marduk"
4107,L.E.,"(see Ward, _Seal Cylinders_, Chap. XXVII). The exact determination of"
4108,L.E.,the various weapons depicted on seal-cylinders merits a special study.
4109,L.E.,
4110,L.E.,"Line 181. Begins a speech of Huwawa, extending to line 187, reported"

4113,L.E.,
4114,L.E.,"Line 183. _lu-uk-sú-su_ (also l. 186), from _akâsu_, ""drive on"" or"
4115,L.E.,"""lure on,"" occurs on the Pennsylvania tablet, line 135, _uk-ki-si_,"
4116,L.E.,"""lure on"" or ""entrap,"" which Langdon erroneously renders ""take away"""
4117,L.E.,and thereby misses the point completely. See the comment to the line
4118,L.E.,of the Pennsylvania tablet in question.
4119,L.E.,
4120,L.E.,"Line 192. On the phrase _sanû bunu_, ""change of countenance,"" in the"
4121,L.E.,"sense of ""enraged,"" see the note to the Pennsylvania tablet, l.31."
4122,L.E.,
4123,L.E.,"Line 194. _nu-ma-at_ occurs in a tablet published by Meissner,"
4124,L.E.,"_Altbabyl. Privatrecht_, No. 100, with _bît abi_, which shows that the"
4125,L.E.,"total confine of a property is meant; here, therefore, the ""interior"""
4126,L.E.,"of the forest or heart. It is hardly a ""by-form"" of _nuptum_ as"
4127,L.E.,"Muss-Arnolt, _Assyrian Dictionary_, p. 690b, and others have supposed,"
4128,L.E.,"though _nu-um-tum_ in one passage quoted by Muss-Arnolt, _ib._ p. 705a,"
4129,L.E.,may have arisen from an aspirate pronunciation of the _p_ in _nubtum_.
4130,L.E.,
4131,L.E.,Line 215. The kneeling attitude of prayer is an interesting
4132,L.E.,"touch. It symbolizes submission, as is shown by the description of"
4133,L.E.,"Gilgamesh's defeat in the encounter with Enkidu (Pennsylvania tablet,"
4134,L.E.,"l. 227), where Gilgamesh is represented as forced to ""kneel"" to the"
4135,L.E.,"ground. Again in the Assyrian version, Tablet V, 4, 6, Gilgamesh kneels"
4136,L.E.,down (though the reading _ka-mis_ is not certain) and has a vision.
4137,L.E.,
4138,L.E.,Line 229. It is much to be regretted that this line is so badly
4139,L.E.,"preserved, for it would have enabled us definitely to restore the"
4140,L.E.,opening line of the Assyrian version of the Gilgamesh Epic. The
4141,L.E.,"fragment published by Jeremias in his appendix to his _Izdubar-Nimrod_,"
4142,L.E.,"Plate IV, gives us the end of the colophon line to the Epic, reading"
4143,L.E.,"......... _di ma-a-ti_ (cf. _ib._, Pl. I, 1.  ... _a-ti_). Our text"
4144,L.E.,"evidently reproduces the same phrase and enables us to supply _ka_,"
4145,L.E.,as well as the name of the hero Gish of which there are distinct
4146,L.E.,"traces. The missing word, therefore, describes the hero as the"
4147,L.E.,"ruler, or controller of the land. But what are the two signs before"
4148,L.E.,"_ka_? A participial form from _pakâdu_, which one naturally thinks"
4149,L.E.,"of, is impossible because of the _ka_, and for the same reason one"
4150,L.E.,cannot supply the word for shepherd (_nakidu_). One might think of
4151,L.E.,"_ka-ak-ka-du_, except that _kakkadu_ is not used for ""head"" in the"
4152,L.E.,"sense of ""chief"" of the land. I venture to restore _[i-ik-]ka-di_,"
4153,L.E.,"""strong one."" Our text at all events disposes of Haupt's conjecture"
4154,L.E.,"_is-di ma-a-ti_ (_JAOS_ 22, p. 11), ""Bottom of the earth,"" as also of"
4155,L.E.,"Ungnad's proposed _[a-di pa]-a-ti_, ""to the ends"" (Ungnad-Gressmann,"
4156,L.E.,"_Gilgamesch-Epos_, p. 6, note), or a reading _di-ma-a-ti_,"

4165,L.E.,
4166,L.E.,We may at all events be quite certain that the name of the hero
4167,L.E.,occurred in the first line and that he was described by some epithet
4168,L.E.,indicating his superior position.
4169,L.E.,
4170,L.E.,"Lines 229-235 are again an address of Gilgamesh to the sun-god, after"
4171,L.E.,"having received a favorable ""oracle"" from the god (line 222). The"
4172,L.E.,"hero promises to honor and to celebrate the god, by erecting thrones"
4173,L.E.,for him.
4174,L.E.,
4175,L.E.,"Lines 237-244 describe the arming of the hero by the ""master"""

4182,L.E.,
4183,L.E.,"Lines 251-252 correspond to column 1, 6-8, of King's fragment, with"
4184,L.E.,"interesting variations ""battle"" and ""fight"" instead of ""way"" and"
4185,L.E.,"""road,"" which show that in the interval between the old Babylonian and"
4186,L.E.,"the Assyrian version, the real reason why Enkidu should lead the way,"
4187,L.E.,"namely, because he knows the country in which Huwawa dwells (lines"
4188,L.E.,"252-253), was supplemented by describing Enkidu also as being more"
4189,L.E.,experienced in battle than Gilgamesh.
4190,L.E.,
4191,L.E.,Line 254. I am unable to furnish a satisfactory rendering for this
4192,L.E.,"line, owing to the uncertainty of the word at the end. Can it be"
4193,L.E.,"""his household,"" from the stem which in Hebrew gives us MISEPOHOH"
4194,L.E.,"""family?"""
4195,L.E.,
4196,L.E.,"Line 255. Is paralleled by col. 1, 4, of King's new fragment. The"
4197,L.E.,"episode of Gish and Enkidu proceeding to Ninsun, the mother of Gish,"
4198,L.E.,"to obtain her counsel, which follows in King's fragment, appears to"
4199,L.E.,have been omitted in the old Babylonian version. Such an elaboration of
4200,L.E.,the tale is exactly what we should expect as it passed down the ages.
4201,L.E.,
4202,L.E.,"Line 257. Our text shows that _irnittu_ (lines 257, 264, 265) means"
4203,L.E.,"primarily ""endeavor,"" and then success in one's endeavor, or ""triumph."""
4204,L.E.,
4205,L.E.,Lines 266-270. Do not appear to refer to rites performed after a
4206,L.E.,"victory, as might at a first glance appear, but merely voice the hope"
4207,L.E.,"that Gish will completely take possession of Huwawa's territory, so"
4208,L.E.,as to wash up after the fight in Huwawa's own stream; and the hope
4209,L.E.,is also expressed that he may find pure water in Huwawa's land in
4210,L.E.,"abundance, to offer a libation to Shamash."
4211,L.E.,
4212,L.E.,"Line 275. _On sú-pa-as-su_ = _supat-su_, see above, to l. 115."
4213,L.E.,
4214,L.E.,
4215,L.E.,"[Note on Sabitum (above, p. 11)"
4216,L.E.,
4217,L.E.,"In a communication before the Oriental Club of Philadelphia (Feb. 10,"
4218,L.E.,"1920), Prof. Haupt made the suggestion that _sa-bi-tum_ (or _tu_),"
4219,L.E.,"hitherto regarded as a proper name, is an epithet describing the"
4220,L.E.,woman who dwells at the seashore which Gilgamesh in the course of his
4221,L.E.,"wanderings reaches, as an ""innkeeper"". It is noticeable that the term"
4222,L.E.,always appears without the determinative placed before proper names;
4223,L.E.,and since in the old Babylonian version (so far as preserved) and
4224,L.E.,"in the Assyrian version, the determinative is invariably used, its"
4225,L.E.,"consistent absence in the case of _sabitum_ (Assyrian Version, Tablet"
4226,L.E.,"X, 1, 1, 10, 15, 20; 2, 15-16 [_sa-bit_]; Meissner fragment col. 2,"
4227,L.E.,11-12) speaks in favor of Professor Haupt's suggestion. The meaning
4228,L.E.,"""innkeeper"", while not as yet found in Babylonian-Assyrian literature"
4229,L.E.,"is most plausible, since we have _sabu_ as a general name for 'drink',"
4230,L.E.,though originally designating perhaps more specifically sesame wine
4231,L.E.,"(Muss-Arnolt, Assyrian Dictionary, p. 745b) or distilled brandy,"
4232,L.E.,"according to Prof. Haupt. Similarly, in the Aramaic dialects, _se_bha"
4233,L.E.,"is used for ""to drink"" and in the Pael to ""furnish drink"". Muss-Arnolt"
4234,L.E.,"in his Assyrian Dictionary, 746b, has also recognized that _sabitum_"
4235,L.E.,was originally an epithet and compares the Aramaic _se_bhoyâthâ(p1)
4236,L.E.,"""barmaids"". In view of the bad reputation of inns in ancient Babylonia"
4237,L.E.,"as brothels, it would be natural for an epithet like _sabitum_ to"
4238,L.E.,"become the equivalent to ""public"" women, just as the inn was a ""public"""
4239,L.E.,"house. Sabitum would, therefore, have the same force as _samhatu_"

4242,L.E.,"term for the female innkeeper is Sal Gestinna ""the woman of the wine,"""
4243,L.E.,known to us from the Hammurabi Code §§108-111. The bad reputation of
4244,L.E.,"inns is confirmed by these statutes, for the house of the Sal Gestinna"
4245,L.E.,is a gathering place for outlaws. The punishment of a female devotee
4246,L.E.,"who enters the ""house of a wine woman"" (bît Sal Gestinna §110) is"
4247,L.E.,"death. It was not ""prohibition"" that prompted so severe a punishment,"
4248,L.E.,but the recognition of the purpose for which a devotee would enter
4249,L.E.,such a house of ill repute. The speech of the _sabitum_ or innkeeper
4250,L.E.,"to Gilgamesh (above, p. 12) was, therefore, an invitation to stay with"
4251,L.E.,"her, instead of seeking for life elsewhere. Viewed as coming from a"
4252,L.E.,"""public woman"" the address becomes significant. The invitation would"
4253,L.E.,be parallel to the temptation offered by the _harimtu_ in the first
4254,L.E.,"tablet of the Enkidu, and to which Enkidu succumbs. The incident"
4255,L.E.,"in the tablet would, therefore, form a parallel in the adventures"
4256,L.E.,of Gilgamesh to the one that originally belonged to the Enkidu
4257,L.E.,"cycle. Finally, it is quite possible that _sabitum_ is actually the"
4258,L.E.,"Akkadian equivalent of the Sumerian Sal Gestinna, though naturally"
4259,L.E.,until this equation is confirmed by a syllabary or by other direct
4260,L.E.,"evidence, it remains a conjecture. See now also Albright's remarks"

4751,NOTES,
4752,NOTES,[65] Professor Clay strongly favors an Amoritic origin also
4753,NOTES,for Gilgamesh. His explanation of the name is set forth in his
4754,NOTES,"recent work on _The Empire of the Amorites_, page 89, and is also"
4755,NOTES,"referred to in his work on _Amurru_, page 79, and in his volume"
4756,NOTES,"of _Miscellaneous Inscriptions in the Yale Babylonian Collection_,"
4757,NOTES,"page 3, note. According to Professor Clay the original form of the"
4758,NOTES,"hero's name was West Semitic, and was something like _Bilga-Mash_,"
4759,NOTES,"the meaning of which was perhaps ""the offspring of Mash."" For the"
4760,NOTES,"first element in this division of the name cf. Pilikam, the name of"
4761,NOTES,"a ruler of an early dynasty, and Balak of the Old Testament. In view"
4762,NOTES,of the fact that the axe figures so prominently in the Epic as an
4763,NOTES,"instrument wielded by Gilgamesh, Professor Clay furthermore thinks it"
4764,NOTES,reasonable to assume that the name was interpreted by the Babylonian
4765,NOTES,"scribe as ""the axe of Mash."" In this way he would account for the"
4766,NOTES,"use of the determinative for weapons, which is also the sign Gish,"
4767,NOTES,in the name. It is certainly noteworthy that the ideogram Gish-Tún in
4768,NOTES,"the later form of _Gish-Tún-mash_ = _pasu_, ""axe,"" _CT_ XVI, 38:14b,"
4769,NOTES,"etc. _Tun_ also = _pilaku_ ""axe,"" _CT_ xii, 10:34b. Names with similar"

4773,NOTES,It is only proper to add that Professor Jastrow assumes the
