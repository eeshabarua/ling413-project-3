93,PREFACE,PREFACE
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,The epic is a drama on gigantic scale; its acts are years or centuries;
97,PREFACE,"its actors, heroes; its stage, the world of life; its events, those"
98,PREFACE,mighty cycles of activity that leave their deep impress on human
99,PREFACE,history. Homer’s epics reënact the stirring scenes of the ten years’
100,PREFACE,"siege of Troy, and the perilous, long wanderings of Ulysses before he"
101,PREFACE,reached his home; Vergil’s epic action embraces the fall of Troy and the
102,PREFACE,never-ending struggles of Æneas and his band of exiles till Troy should
103,PREFACE,rise again in the western world; Tasso pictures the heroic war of
104,PREFACE,"Godfrey and his crusaders, who strove to free the holy city of"
105,PREFACE,"Jerusalem; and Milton, ignoring all bounds of time and space, fills his"
106,PREFACE,"triple stage of heaven, earth, and hell with angels, men, and devils,"
107,PREFACE,all working out the most stupendous problems of human destiny.
108,PREFACE,
109,PREFACE,Such gigantic dramas could be presented on no human stage. But in them
110,PREFACE,all are lesser actions of marked dramatic possibility. Notable among
111,PREFACE,"these are the events culminating in the death of Hector, the home coming"
112,PREFACE,"of Ulysses and his destruction of the suitors, Satan’s rebellion and"
113,PREFACE,"expulsion from heaven, and the temptation and fall of man. All these"
114,PREFACE,furnish abundant material for the tragic stage; but all leave much to be
115,PREFACE,supplied of speech and action before the full-rounded drama could take
116,PREFACE,"form. In the _Æneid_ alone is found, among the minor parts which make up"
117,PREFACE,"the epic whole, a dramatic action well-nigh complete—the love story of"
118,PREFACE,Æneas and Dido.
119,PREFACE,
120,PREFACE,The ordinary student of Vergil is too much engrossed with an intensive
121,PREFACE,"study of the text, and has too near a view of the poem, to appreciate"
122,PREFACE,"how fully this story is worked out in detail; how its speech, action,"
123,PREFACE,and events all lead to a dramatic climax. There is need only here and
124,PREFACE,"there of an interpolated lyric upon some suggested theme, a bit of"
125,PREFACE,Vergil’s description of action or feeling expressed in the actor’s
126,PREFACE,"words, an interjected line to relieve the strain of too long speech—all"
127,PREFACE,"else is Vergil’s own, ready to be lifted out of its larger epic setting"
128,PREFACE,and portrayed upon the stage.
129,PREFACE,
130,PREFACE,"In arranging and translating this epic tragedy, the authors have made"
131,PREFACE,only such minor additions and alterations of the original as seemed
132,PREFACE,necessary from the dramatic point of view. Prominent among these are the
133,PREFACE,"introduction of lyrics at certain points, the obviously necessary"
134,PREFACE,curtailing of the banquet scene by the omission of the long narrative of
135,PREFACE,"Æneas, and the removal behind the scenes of the final tragedy of Dido’s"
136,PREFACE,suicide. The lyrical parts have been set to original music in sympathy
137,PREFACE,with the themes; stage action and scenery are suggested by outline
138,PREFACE,drawings of the different settings; and idealized figures and costumes
139,PREFACE,"are reproduced from ancient vases and bas-reliefs. These figures have,"
140,PREFACE,"in some cases, been assigned by scholars to other subjects; but they may"
141,PREFACE,"be taken, for the purposes of the present work, as illustrative of the"
142,PREFACE,characters designated.
143,PREFACE,
144,PREFACE,"With full consciousness of the shortcomings of the work, but with the"
145,PREFACE,hope also of assisting the student in school and home to a fuller
146,PREFACE,"appreciation of the power and beauty of Vergil, this volume is"
147,PREFACE,respectfully presented to the public.

155,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"The first edition of this volume, containing only the _Dido: An Epic"
156,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"Tragedy_, a dramatization of the love story of Æneas and Dido, was"
157,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"published in 1900, and met with a gratifying success. Teachers of Vergil"
158,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,have found the book an interesting supplement to their study and
159,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,presentation of the text; and in numerous instances high-school and
160,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,college classes have staged the play with most excellent results.
161,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
162,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,The book has been out of print for several years; but the continued
163,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,demand from teachers who desire to use it has made a second edition
164,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"desirable. This is accordingly offered in the present volume, under a"
165,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"new title, and containing a second dramatization from Vergil—this from"
166,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the second _Æneid_, the story of the Fall of Troy."

193,THE ARGUMENT,"in the summer of the seventh year, he approached the shores of Africa."
194,THE ARGUMENT,Here a violent storm arose which scattered and all but destroyed the
195,THE ARGUMENT,"Trojan ships. Æneas, with a number of his companions, was cast upon a"

267,ACT I. SCENE 1,
268,ACT I. SCENE 1,Early morning; the open square before the temple of Juno on a height
269,ACT I. SCENE 1,"near Carthage. In the distance (see cut, 1, 2, 3) appear mountains, and"
270,ACT I. SCENE 1,"at their foot lies the city, clustered about the harbor where ships are"
271,ACT I. SCENE 1,riding at anchor. The effect of elevation is increased by the unfinished
272,ACT I. SCENE 1,columns and the tree-tops just showing above the low marble wall which
273,ACT I. SCENE 1,"encloses the square. This scene (4) is set nearer than 1, 2, 3, to"
274,ACT I. SCENE 1,increase the perspective.
275,ACT I. SCENE 1,
276,ACT I. SCENE 1,"At the first wing on the right (5), a colonnade, leading to a flight of"
277,ACT I. SCENE 1,"steps, forms the entrance from the city below. On the same side, along"
278,ACT I. SCENE 1,"the wall, is a broad marble seat (6), shaded by a wild crab tree, pink"
279,ACT I. SCENE 1,with bloom. The dark rug on the step before it is strewn with fallen
280,ACT I. SCENE 1,petals. On the left is the front of the temple (7). Two large columns of
281,ACT I. SCENE 1,white marble flank three broad steps leading to the platform. Above
282,ACT I. SCENE 1,"these columns, the architrave bears a frieze representing scenes from"
283,ACT I. SCENE 1,the Trojan war. Before the temple door is an altar on which fire is
284,ACT I. SCENE 1,burning.
285,ACT I. SCENE 1,
286,ACT I. SCENE 1,"At the rise of the curtain, a chorus of Carthaginian maidens, clad in"
287,ACT I. SCENE 1,"white, are seen kneeling before the altar on the temple steps; they sing"
288,ACT I. SCENE 1,a greeting to the dawn.
289,ACT I. SCENE 1,
290,ACT I. SCENE 1,
291,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Hymn to the Dawn_
292,ACT I. SCENE 1,
293,ACT I. SCENE 1,"[For music, see p. 61]"
294,ACT I. SCENE 1,
295,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Wake, Aurora, Wake!"
296,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Come, rosy-fingered goddess of the dawn,"
297,ACT I. SCENE 1,The saffron couch of old Tithonus scorning;
298,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Fling wide the golden portals of the morning,"
299,ACT I. SCENE 1,And bid the gloomy mists of night be gone.
300,ACT I. SCENE 1,
301,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Hail, Aurora, Hail!"
302,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The dewy stars have sped their silent flight,"
303,ACT I. SCENE 1,The fuller glories of thy rays expecting;
304,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With rosy beauty from afar reflecting,"
305,ACT I. SCENE 1,Thy Orient steeds come panting into sight.
306,ACT I. SCENE 1,
307,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Rise, Apollo, Rise!"
308,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Send forth thy healing rays to greet the world,"
309,ACT I. SCENE 1,Upon the lands thy blessed radiance streaming;
310,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Arise, and fling afar, in splendor gleaming,"
311,ACT I. SCENE 1,The banners of thy golden light unfurled.
312,ACT I. SCENE 1,
313,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Enter Æneas and Achates, on their way into the city, evidently attracted"
314,ACT I. SCENE 1,hither by the singing. Æneas is resplendent in full armor. Achates wears
315,ACT I. SCENE 1,"the Phrygian costume: long trousers of brown, a tunic of deep old blue,"
316,ACT I. SCENE 1,ornate with embroidered patterns in gold and purple thread; over this a
317,ACT I. SCENE 1,traveling cloak of brown. He carries two spears. The maidens withdraw
318,ACT I. SCENE 1,and as their voices grow fainter Æneas and Achates kneel before the
319,ACT I. SCENE 1,altar. The light brightens. A bugle call in the distance rouses them
320,ACT I. SCENE 1,"from their devotion. They arise. Enter Venus, dressed as a huntress."
321,ACT I. SCENE 1,
322,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Venus_ (_Æneid_, I. 321-324):"
323,ACT I. SCENE 1,
324,ACT I. SCENE 1,"I crave your grace, good sirs. If my attendant maids"
325,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Have chanced to wander hither, quiver-girt, and clad"
326,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In tawny robes of fur, the trophies of the chase,"
327,ACT I. SCENE 1,Or with triumphant shouts close pressing in pursuit
328,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The foaming boar,—I fain would know their course."
329,ACT I. SCENE 1,
330,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_ (326-334):
331,ACT I. SCENE 1,
332,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Fair maid,"
333,ACT I. SCENE 1,"No huntress of thy train have we beheld, nor heard"
334,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The clamor of their chase.—But oh, no mortal maid"
335,ACT I. SCENE 1,Art thou! Th’ immortal beauty of thy face and voice
336,ACT I. SCENE 1,Proclaim thee goddess. Art thou Phœbus’ sister then?
337,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Or some fair nymph? Whoe’er thou art, we crave _thy_ grace:"
338,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Be merciful and tell beneath what sky at length,"
339,ACT I. SCENE 1,Upon what shores we ‘re tossed. For ignorant of men
340,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And land we wander, driven on by wind and wave"
341,ACT I. SCENE 1,In vast conspiracy.
342,ACT I. SCENE 1,Full many a victim slain
343,ACT I. SCENE 1,Upon thine altars shall repay thine aid.
344,ACT I. SCENE 1,
345,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Venus_ (335-350):
346,ACT I. SCENE 1,
347,ACT I. SCENE 1,"For me,"
348,ACT I. SCENE 1,I claim no homage due the gods. Behold a maid
349,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Of ancient Tyre, with quiver girt and feet high shod"
350,ACT I. SCENE 1,With purple buskin—such our country’s garb. Thou seest
351,ACT I. SCENE 1,Before thee Punic realms; the city and its men
352,ACT I. SCENE 1,Are both alike Phœnician; but around them lie
353,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The borders of the Libyans, hardy race, unmatched"
354,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In war. The city owns the sway of Dido, late"
355,ACT I. SCENE 1,Escaped from Tyre and from her brother’s threat’nings. Long
356,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The story of her wrongs, and devious its way;"
357,ACT I. SCENE 1,But here I ‘ll trace the outline of her history.
358,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Her husband was Sychæus, of his countrymen"
359,ACT I. SCENE 1,The richest far in wide possessions; well beloved
360,ACT I. SCENE 1,"By his ill-fated bride was he, whose virgin hand"
361,ACT I. SCENE 1,In wedlock’s primal rite her sire had given him.
362,ACT I. SCENE 1,"But Tyre’s domain Pygmalion her brother held,"
363,ACT I. SCENE 1,Surpassing all in crime. Between these Tyrian lords
364,ACT I. SCENE 1,A deadly feud arose. With impious hand and blind
365,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With love of gold, Pygmalion, at the altar-side,"
366,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With stealthy, unsuspected stroke Sychæus slew;"
367,ACT I. SCENE 1,And little recked he of his sister’s doting love.
368,ACT I. SCENE 1,
369,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Æneas_ (III. 56, 57):"
370,ACT I. SCENE 1,
371,ACT I. SCENE 1,"O awful, quenchless thirst of gold! ‘T was ever thus"
372,ACT I. SCENE 1,That thou hast spurred the hearts of men to deeds of blood.
373,ACT I. SCENE 1,
374,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Venus_ (I. 351-370):
375,ACT I. SCENE 1,
376,ACT I. SCENE 1,"He long concealed the deed with wanton, feigned excuse,"
377,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And mocked his sister, sick at heart, with empty hopes."
378,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In vain: for in the visions of the night the shade,"
379,ACT I. SCENE 1,The pallid shade of her unburied husband came;
380,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The cruel altar and his piercèd breast he showed,"
381,ACT I. SCENE 1,And all the hidden guilt of that proud house revealed.
382,ACT I. SCENE 1,"He bade her speed her flight and leave her fatherland,"
383,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And showed, to aid her cause, deep buried in the earth,"
384,ACT I. SCENE 1,"An ancient treasure, store of silver and of gold"
385,ACT I. SCENE 1,Uncounted.
386,ACT I. SCENE 1,Thus forewarned the queen prepared her flight
387,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And bade her comrades join her enterprise. They came,"
388,ACT I. SCENE 1,Whom hatred or consuming terror of the prince
389,ACT I. SCENE 1,Inspired. A fleet of ships at anchor chanced to lie
390,ACT I. SCENE 1,In waiting. These they seized and quickly filled with gold;
391,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Pygmalion’s treasure, heaped with greedy care, was reft"
392,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Away upon the sea, a woman leading all."
393,ACT I. SCENE 1,They reached at last the place where now the mighty walls
394,ACT I. SCENE 1,And newly rising citadel of Carthage stand.
395,ACT I. SCENE 1,But who and whence are ye? and whither do ye fare?
396,ACT I. SCENE 1,
397,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_ (372-385):
398,ACT I. SCENE 1,
399,ACT I. SCENE 1,"O goddess, if beginning at the first the tale"
400,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Of direful woes on land and deep I should relate,"
401,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The day, before my story’s end, would sink to rest."

403,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Borne over many seas, the fitful tempest’s will"

405,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Æneas am I called,"
406,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The Pious, for that in my ships I ever bear"
407,ACT I. SCENE 1,"My country’s gods, snatched from our burning Troy. My fame"
408,ACT I. SCENE 1,"O’erleaps the stars. My quest is Italy, a land"
409,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And race that mighty Jove hath promised me. For this,"
410,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With score of vessels staunch I braved the Phrygian sea,"
411,ACT I. SCENE 1,By Venus’ star directed and by fate impelled.
412,ACT I. SCENE 1,"But oh, alas for Venus’ star, alas for fate!"
413,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Scarce seven shattered barks survive the waves, and I—"
414,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And I, a beggared stranger, wander helpless here,"
415,ACT I. SCENE 1,A fugitive from all the world.

420,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Full sure am I the gods must love thee well, since thou"
421,ACT I. SCENE 1,Through dangers manifold hast reached this Tyrian realm.
422,ACT I. SCENE 1,But haste thee and with heart of cheer seek out the queen.
423,ACT I. SCENE 1,"For lo, thy friends are rescued and thy fleet restored,"
424,ACT I. SCENE 1,Unless in vain my parents taught me augury.
425,ACT I. SCENE 1,"For see, those joyous swans are fluttering to the earth,"
426,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Which, swooping from the sky, but now the bird of Jove"
427,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Was harrying. As they, with fluttering wings and cries"

429,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Thy ships and comrades even now are safe in port,"
430,ACT I. SCENE 1,Or with full sails the harbor’s mouth are entering.
431,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Then fare thee on, and follow where the path of fate"
432,ACT I. SCENE 1,May lead.
433,ACT I. SCENE 1,
434,ACT I. SCENE 1,As Venus vanishes from the temple steps she is illumined in rosy light.

436,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_ (402-409):
437,ACT I. SCENE 1,

441,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In stately folds, and she doth walk, a goddess all,"
442,ACT I. SCENE 1,With tread majestic!
443,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Lo, ‘t is Venus’ self! O stay,"
444,ACT I. SCENE 1,"My heavenly mother, stay! Why dost thou, cruel too,"
445,ACT I. SCENE 1,So often mock thy son with borrowed semblances?
446,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Why may we not join hands, each in his proper self,"
447,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And speak the words of truth? Ah me! She’s vanished quite,"
448,ACT I. SCENE 1,And I am left forlorn!—
449,ACT I. SCENE 1,

457,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With eager zeal press on their various toil. See there,"
458,ACT I. SCENE 1,Some build the citadel and heave up massive stones
459,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With straining hands; while some a humbler task essay,"
460,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And trace the furrow round their future homes. Behold,"
461,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Within the harbor others toil, and here thou seest"
462,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The deep foundations of the theater, where soon"
463,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Shall rise huge columns, stately set, to deck the scene."
464,ACT I. SCENE 1,
465,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_(430-437):
466,ACT I. SCENE 1,
467,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Yea all, like busy bees throughout the flowery mead,"
468,ACT I. SCENE 1,Are all astir with eager toil. O blessed toil!
469,ACT I. SCENE 1,"O happy ye, whose walls already rise! But I,—"
470,ACT I. SCENE 1,When shall I see _my_ city and my city’s walls?

477,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Our Trojan battles one by one, that mighty strife"
478,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Whose fame has filled the world. Here see Achilles fierce,"

484,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Is not o’erburdened with our woes? O fallen King,"
485,ACT I. SCENE 1,"E’en here our glorious struggle wins its meed of praise,"
486,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And those our mortal hopes defeated and o’erthrown,"
487,ACT I. SCENE 1,Are mourned by human tears.
488,ACT I. SCENE 1,Therefore our present cares
489,ACT I. SCENE 1,Let us dismiss. This fame shall bring us safety too.
490,ACT I. SCENE 1,
491,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Achates_, continuing to examine the pediment (467, 468):"
492,ACT I. SCENE 1,
493,ACT I. SCENE 1,"See how the Greeks are fleeing, pressed by Trojan youth!"
494,ACT I. SCENE 1,"While here, alas, our warriors flee Achilles’ might."
495,ACT I. SCENE 1,
496,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_ (469-478):
497,ACT I. SCENE 1,
498,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And here behold the ill-starred Rhesus’ white-winged tents,"
499,ACT I. SCENE 1,Where fierce Tydides slays his sleeping foe; and drives
500,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Those snowy steeds to join the Grecian camp, before"
501,ACT I. SCENE 1,They graze in Trojan meadows or the Xanthus drink.
502,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Alas poor Troilus, I see thee too, ill-matched"
503,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With great Achilles. Prone thou liest within thy car,"
504,ACT I. SCENE 1,While in the dust thy comely locks and valiant spear
505,ACT I. SCENE 1,Are basely trailed.
506,ACT I. SCENE 1,
507,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Achates_ (479-482):
508,ACT I. SCENE 1,
509,ACT I. SCENE 1,Here to Minerva’s temple come
510,ACT I. SCENE 1,Our Trojan dames with suppliant mien and votive gifts;
511,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With locks dishevelled, self-inflicted blows, and tears;"
512,ACT I. SCENE 1,But all for naught. All unappeased the goddess stands
513,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With stern averted face, nor will she heed their prayers."
514,ACT I. SCENE 1,
515,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_ (483-487):

517,ACT I. SCENE 1,Thrice round the walls of Troy the fell Achilles drags
518,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The body of my friend.—O Hector, Hector! Here"
519,ACT I. SCENE 1,"He sells thy lifeless body for accursed gold,"
520,ACT I. SCENE 1,While aged Priam stretches forth his helpless hands.
521,ACT I. SCENE 1,
522,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Achates_ (488-497):
523,ACT I. SCENE 1,
524,ACT I. SCENE 1,And here behold thyself amid the Grecian chiefs
525,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In combat raging. See the swarthy Memnon’s arms,"
526,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And that fierce maid, who, clad in gleaming armor, dares"
527,ACT I. SCENE 1,To lead her Amazons and mingle in the fray.
528,ACT I. SCENE 1,
529,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Music is heard in the distance, flutes and zithers leading a chorus."
530,ACT I. SCENE 1,
531,ACT I. SCENE 1,"But hark! The distant strains of music greet my ear,"
532,ACT I. SCENE 1,As of some stately progress fitly timed with flute
533,ACT I. SCENE 1,And zither.
534,ACT I. SCENE 1,"See, it is the queen, who with her band"
535,ACT I. SCENE 1,Of chosen youths and maidens hither takes her way.
536,ACT I. SCENE 1,
537,ACT I. SCENE 1,_Æneas_ (498-501):
538,ACT I. SCENE 1,
539,ACT I. SCENE 1,How like Diana when she leads her bands by swift
540,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Eurotas, or on Cynthus green, while round her press"
541,ACT I. SCENE 1,"A thousand graceful creatures of the wood; but she,"
542,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With shoulder quiver-girt, a very goddess moves"
543,ACT I. SCENE 1,With stately tread among the lesser beings of
544,ACT I. SCENE 1,Her train. To such an one I liken yonder queen.
545,ACT I. SCENE 1,
546,ACT I. SCENE 1,They conceal themselves in the foreground behind the columns of the
547,ACT I. SCENE 1,"temple. Dido, accompanied by her bands of courtiers, crosses the stage"
548,ACT I. SCENE 1,and ascends the temple steps. She seats herself on the throne which has
549,ACT I. SCENE 1,been placed for her at the temple door.
550,ACT I. SCENE 1,
551,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Dido throughout this act is dressed in white, the symbol of her"
552,ACT I. SCENE 1,"widowhood. Her dress, worn without himation, is of light filmy stuff"
553,ACT I. SCENE 1,"draped in the Greek style, and unornamented save for a border of gold"
554,ACT I. SCENE 1,"thread. Anna wears a dress of delicate blue, elaborately embroidered"
555,ACT I. SCENE 1,"about the edges with a Greek pattern in gold thread. Her himation,"
556,ACT I. SCENE 1,"wrapped gracefully about her, is a tender shade of rose pink."
557,ACT I. SCENE 1,
558,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In Dido’s train all classes are represented, gayly dressed courtiers,"
559,ACT I. SCENE 1,"soldiers, and peasants. The men wear cloaks of dark blue and of rich"
560,ACT I. SCENE 1,"brown over their tunics. The women are clad in dresses of cream color,"
561,ACT I. SCENE 1,"pink, and faint green."
562,ACT I. SCENE 1,
563,ACT I. SCENE 1,"When all are on the stage, the general effect should be a mingling of"
564,ACT I. SCENE 1,"pink, blue, brown, green, and white, which harmonize with the tints of"
565,ACT I. SCENE 1,"the marble, of the flowering crab tree, the blue sky, and the purple"
566,ACT I. SCENE 1,mountains.
567,ACT I. SCENE 1,
568,ACT I. SCENE 1,Suddenly Ilioneus and his following of Trojans appear. They wear the
569,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Phrygian costume, but over it the long brown traveling cloak. The"
570,ACT I. SCENE 1,"singing ceases, the guards lower their spears, and great excitement"
571,ACT I. SCENE 1,reigns.
572,ACT I. SCENE 1,
573,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Æneas_, aside (509, 510):"
574,ACT I. SCENE 1,
575,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Achates, can it be? What! Antheus, and our brave"
576,ACT I. SCENE 1,Cloanthus and Sergestus too?
577,ACT I. SCENE 1,
578,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Achates_, aside (511-514):"
579,ACT I. SCENE 1,
580,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Yea, all our friends"
581,ACT I. SCENE 1,Whose ships the raging storm hath parted from our fleet
582,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And driven far away. O joy! Come, let us go"
583,ACT I. SCENE 1,And grasp their hands in greeting.
584,ACT I. SCENE 1,
585,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Æneas_, aside (515-521):"
586,ACT I. SCENE 1,
587,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Nay, not so, for still"
588,ACT I. SCENE 1,Our fortune in the balance hangs. Here let us see
589,ACT I. SCENE 1,"What fate befalls our friends, where they have left their fleet,"
590,ACT I. SCENE 1,And why they hither come. For chosen messengers
591,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In suppliant aspect do they seek this sacred fane,"
592,ACT I. SCENE 1,"While round them rage the mob.—But see, Ilioneus speaks."
593,ACT I. SCENE 1,
594,ACT I. SCENE 1,Dido has arisen and with a gesture bids the soldiers stand aside. She
595,ACT I. SCENE 1,sends a page to lead Ilioneus to her throne. Ilioneus kneels before her;
596,ACT I. SCENE 1,"she extends the scepter, which he touches."
597,ACT I. SCENE 1,
598,ACT I. SCENE 1,"_Ilioneus_, rising and standing before the queen (522-558):"
599,ACT I. SCENE 1,
600,ACT I. SCENE 1,O Queen to whom the king of heav’n hath given to found
601,ACT I. SCENE 1,A city and to curb proud nations with the reins
602,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Of law, we Trojans in our need, the sport of winds"
603,ACT I. SCENE 1,"On every sea, implore thee, spare a pious race"
604,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And look, we pray, with nearer view upon our cause."
605,ACT I. SCENE 1,We have not come to devastate with fire and sword
606,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The Libyan homes, or fill our ships with plundered stores."
607,ACT I. SCENE 1,Such violence and such high-handed deeds a race
608,ACT I. SCENE 1,"By fate o’ercome may not attempt. There is a place,"
609,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Hesperia the Greeks have named it, ancient, rich"
610,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In heroes, and of fertile soil. Œnotrians"
611,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Once held the land; but now, as rumor goes, their sons"
612,ACT I. SCENE 1,In honor of their mighty leader have the place
613,ACT I. SCENE 1,Italia called. To this our seaward course was bent:
614,ACT I. SCENE 1,"When suddenly, upstarting from the deep, all charged"
615,ACT I. SCENE 1,"With tempests, did Orion on the shallows drive"
616,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Our vessels, with the aid of boisterous winds and waves,"
617,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Through boiling, overtopping floods and trackless reefs,"
618,ACT I. SCENE 1,And put us utterly to rout. To these thy shores
619,ACT I. SCENE 1,A few of us have drifted. But alas! what race
620,ACT I. SCENE 1,Of men is this? What land permits such savage deeds
621,ACT I. SCENE 1,As these? We are refused the barren refuge of
622,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The sandy shore; they seek a cause for mortal strife,"
623,ACT I. SCENE 1,And will not that we set our feet upon the land.
624,ACT I. SCENE 1,What though the human race and mortal arms are naught
625,ACT I. SCENE 1,To thee; be sure that gods regard the evil and
626,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The good. We had a king, Æneas, more than peer"
627,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Of all in justice, piety, and warrior’s might."
628,ACT I. SCENE 1,"If by decree of fate he still survives, if still"
629,ACT I. SCENE 1,"He draws the vital air of heav’n, and lies not low"
630,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Amid the gloomy shades, fear not, and let it not"
631,ACT I. SCENE 1,Repent thee that in deeds of mercy thou didst strive
632,ACT I. SCENE 1,To be the first. We still possess both towns and lands
633,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Upon Sicilia’s isle; Acestes too, renowned,"
634,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And born of Trojan blood, is ours. Our only prayer,"
635,ACT I. SCENE 1,"That we may draw our shattered fleet upon the shore,"
636,ACT I. SCENE 1,And in the forest shade renew our weakened beams
637,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And broken oars. That thus, if to Italia’s realms,"
638,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Our comrades and our king regained, ‘t is ours again"
639,ACT I. SCENE 1,"To hold our way, with joy we may that selfsame land"
640,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And Latium’s borders seek. But if in vain our hope,"
641,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And if, loved father of the Teucri, thou art held"
642,ACT I. SCENE 1,By Libya’s billows and no more we may upon
643,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Iulus rest our hopes, then let us seek the land"
644,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And homes reserved for us, whence, setting sail, we came"
645,ACT I. SCENE 1,"To these thy hostile shores, and make Acestes king."
646,ACT I. SCENE 1,
647,ACT I. SCENE 1,Shouts of applause from the Trojans.
648,ACT I. SCENE 1,

653,ACT I. SCENE 1,My yet unstable throne compel me thus to guard
654,ACT I. SCENE 1,My bounds with wide and jealous watch. Who knows not well
655,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Æneas and his race, their city Troy, their brave,"
656,ACT I. SCENE 1,Heroic deeds? Who has not seen the far-off flames
657,ACT I. SCENE 1,Of their great war? We carry not such brutish hearts
658,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Within our breasts, nor yet does Phœbus yoke his steeds"
659,ACT I. SCENE 1,"So far from this our land. Seek you the mighty west,"
660,ACT I. SCENE 1,"The land of Saturn’s reign, or where your foster-king,"
661,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Acestes, rules within Sicilia’s borders? Lo,"
662,ACT I. SCENE 1,In safety will I send you forth and gird you with
663,ACT I. SCENE 1,"My aid. Or would you share with me this realm? Behold,"
664,ACT I. SCENE 1,The city which I build is yours. Draw up your ships.
665,ACT I. SCENE 1,To Trojan and to Tyrian will I favor show
666,ACT I. SCENE 1,"In equal measure. Would that your Æneas’ self,"
667,ACT I. SCENE 1,"Conducted by the same o’er-mastering gale, were here!"
668,ACT I. SCENE 1,"My messengers along the shore will I despatch,"
669,ACT I. SCENE 1,"And bid them search the farthest bounds of Libya,"
670,ACT I. SCENE 1,"If he in wood or city, rescued from the waves,"

777,ACT I. SCENE 2,
778,ACT I. SCENE 2,Ah me! I fear this Tyrian hospitality;
779,ACT I. SCENE 2,For well I know their faithless hearts and lying tongues.
780,ACT I. SCENE 2,"And ever, mid the anxious watches of the night,"
781,ACT I. SCENE 2,The savage threats of Juno agitate my soul.
782,ACT I. SCENE 2,If only this fair queen might feel the pulse of love
783,ACT I. SCENE 2,"For this my hero son, then would her purposes"
784,ACT I. SCENE 2,"Of amity be fixed, and my anxiety"
785,ACT I. SCENE 2,Be set at rest.—But how accomplish my design?
786,ACT I. SCENE 2,
787,ACT I. SCENE 2,Suddenly her face is lighted with a new thought. She goes to Cupid and
788,ACT I. SCENE 2,addresses him with insinuating gentleness.
789,ACT I. SCENE 2,
790,ACT I. SCENE 2,"_Venus_, to Cupid (664-688):"

798,ACT I. SCENE 2,"Now Tyrian Dido holds him, and with fawning words"
799,ACT I. SCENE 2,Delays his course; and much do I distrust and fear
800,ACT I. SCENE 2,The shelter which our envious rival Juno gives.
801,ACT I. SCENE 2,"For, in this pregnant crisis of affairs, be sure"
802,ACT I. SCENE 2,She will be active. Wherefore now my mind is bent
803,ACT I. SCENE 2,"With wiles to take the queen, ere Juno steel her heart,"

805,ACT I. SCENE 2,"Of Juno she her present purpose may not change,"
806,ACT I. SCENE 2,But by a mighty love for this her Trojan guest
807,ACT I. SCENE 2,She may be bound to work my will.
808,ACT I. SCENE 2,Now hear thy part:
809,ACT I. SCENE 2,"Obedient to the summons of his doting sire,"
810,ACT I. SCENE 2,The youthful prince Ascanius goes to Dido’s town
811,ACT I. SCENE 2,With gifts which Ocean and the flames of Troy have spared;

832,ACT I. SCENE 3,A banquet hall in Dido’s palace. Across the back of the stage is a
833,ACT I. SCENE 3,"colonnade (2), raised above the level of the hall. Through the columns"
834,ACT I. SCENE 3,there is a view (1) out over the moonlit sea. Two broad steps lead from
835,ACT I. SCENE 3,"the colonnade to a landing, from which again three steps at each side"

840,ACT I. SCENE 3,"(6) is set for the feast, a broad, three-sided table flanked by couches"

842,ACT I. SCENE 3,
843,ACT I. SCENE 3,"When the curtain rises, the moonlight is streaming down through the"

845,ACT I. SCENE 3,there is no light except as it flashes from the side rooms when the
846,ACT I. SCENE 3,curtains are parted for an instant. Servants are strewing the banquet

854,ACT I. SCENE 3,and the other ladies of the court have assumed himations of royal
855,ACT I. SCENE 3,"purple, royal blue, brilliant yellow, and deep green. Æneas has laid"
856,ACT I. SCENE 3,"aside his helmet and greaves, but still wears his breastplate of mail,"
857,ACT I. SCENE 3,although he carries on his shoulder a cloak of royal purple.
858,ACT I. SCENE 3,
859,ACT I. SCENE 3,The Carthaginians are more elaborately and richly dressed than in the
860,ACT I. SCENE 3,"first scene. The Trojans have put aside their outer cloaks, and wear"
861,ACT I. SCENE 3,tunics gayly embroidered in colors. The servants wear tunics of white.
862,ACT I. SCENE 3,
863,ACT I. SCENE 3,"The guests recline upon the couches. Æneas is in the seat of honor,"
864,ACT I. SCENE 3,while Dido has placed the supposed Ascanius upon the couch at her side.

866,ACT I. SCENE 3,
867,ACT I. SCENE 3,Dido rises. There is silence through the room. She intones the

880,ACT I. SCENE 3,

1327,SCENES 2 AND 3,My Trojan city and the dear remains of all

1440,ACT IV. SCENE 1,"To try the man:—go, sister, and in suppliant strain"

1443,ACT IV. SCENE 1,"Nor did I send a hostile fleet to Pergama,"
1444,ACT IV. SCENE 1,"Nor desecrate the sacred ashes of his sire,"

1468,ACT IV. SCENE 1,"flees before it to her husband’s shrine, and is only recalled from the"
1469,ACT IV. SCENE 1,fancy when she finds the curtains drawn before it.
1470,ACT IV. SCENE 1,
1471,ACT IV. SCENE 1,Barce comes tremblingly to her. Dido in bitter remorse draws the

1481,ACT IV. SCENE 2,
1482,ACT IV. SCENE 2,Dido is pacing the room with fierce energy. She goes to the window from
1483,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"time to time, then renews her fierce walking to and fro. Suddenly she"
1484,ACT IV. SCENE 2,presses her hand to her head as if a new thought had come to her. Her
1485,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"face assumes an expression of cunning. She picks up a golden goblet, and"
1486,ACT IV. SCENE 2,with a gesture to the old woman sends her to fill it.
1487,ACT IV. SCENE 2,
1488,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"When Barce has gone, Dido stealthily but quickly takes Æneas’ sword from"
1489,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"the wall, and, seating herself, with trembling fingers draws it from its"

1493,ACT IV. SCENE 2,
1494,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"As she is thus meditating, her sister is heard coming. Dido quickly"

1507,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"Of the Hesperides; her care, the dragon huge"
1508,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"To which she offers honeydew and soothing herbs,"

1517,ACT IV. SCENE 2,"Do thou within the palace rear a lofty pyre,"
1518,ACT IV. SCENE 2,And place upon its top the faithless hero’s arms

1551,ACT IV. SCENE 3,[Selected from Tasso]

1561,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1562,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Ah me, what shall I do? My former suitors seek"
1563,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And be again rejected? Shall I humbly court

1565,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Or shall I rather follow haughty Ilium’s fleet,"

1567,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"‘T is sweet to be delivered, and my former aid"
1568,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Still dwells within their faithful memory? But who,"
1569,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Though I should wish it, would permit me, or receive"
1570,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"The hated Dido in their haughty ships? Ah, poor,"
1571,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Deluded one, dost thou not know, dost thou not still"
1572,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Perceive the frailty of a Trojan oath? What then?
1573,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Shall I forsake my kingdom and accompany

1578,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Nay, nay! as thou deservest, die, and with the sword"

1580,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"To spend my life from wedlock and its sorrows free,"
1581,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"As beasts within their forest lairs? Or why, alas,"
1582,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Was not my promise to Sychæus’ ashes kept?
1583,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1584,ACT IV. SCENE 3,She sprinkles incense on the flame at the shrine of Sychæus. Dawn begins

1586,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"She rushes to the window, and looking out, sees the Trojan fleet sailing"

1594,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Ho there, my men, quick, fetch the torches, seize your arms,"
1595,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And man the oars!—What am I saying? where am I?
1596,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"What madness turns my brain? O most unhappy queen,"
1597,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Is it thus thy evil deeds are coming back to thee?
1598,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Such fate was just when thou didst yield thy scepter up.—
1599,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Lo, _there ‘s_ the fealty of him who, rumor says,"
1600,ACT IV. SCENE 3,His country’s gods with him in all his wandering bears
1601,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And on his shoulders bore his sire from burning Troy!
1602,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Why could I not have torn his body limb from limb,"
1603,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"And strewed his members on the deep? and slain his friends,"
1604,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"His son Ascanius, and served his mangled limbs"
1605,ACT IV. SCENE 3,To grace his father’s feast?—Such conflict might have had
1606,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"A doubtful issue.—Grant it might, but whom had I,"
1607,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Foredoomed to death, to fear? I might have fired his camp,"
1608,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"His ships, and wrapped in common ruin father, son,"
1609,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"And all the race, and given myself to crown the doom"
1610,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Of all.—O Sun, who with thy shining rays dost see"
1611,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"All mortal deeds; O Juno, who dost know and thus"

1614,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"O Hecate; and ye avenging Furies;—ye,"
1615,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"The gods of failing Dido, come and bend your power"
1616,ACT IV. SCENE 3,To these my woes and hear my prayer. If yonder wretch
1617,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Must enter port and reach his land decreed by fate,"
1618,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"If thus the laws of Jove ordain, this order holds:"
1619,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"But, torn in war, a hardy people’s foeman, far"
1620,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"From friends and young Iulus’ arms, may he be forced"
1621,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"To seek a Grecian stranger’s aid, and may he see"
1622,ACT IV. SCENE 3,The death of many whom he loves. And when at last
1623,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"A meager peace on doubtful terms he has secured,"
1624,ACT IV. SCENE 3,May he no pleasure find in kingdom or in life;
1625,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"But may he fall untimely, and unburied lie"
1626,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Upon some solitary strand. This, this I pray,"
1627,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And with my latest breath this final wish proclaim.
1628,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Then, O my Tyrians, with a bitter hate pursue"
1629,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"The whole accursèd race, and send this to my shade"
1630,ACT IV. SCENE 3,As welcome tribute. Let there be no amity
1631,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Between our peoples. Rise thou from my bones,"
1632,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"O some avenger, who with deadly sword and brand"
1633,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Shall scathe the Trojan exiles, now, in time to come,"
1634,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Whenever chance and strength shall favor. Be our shores
1635,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"To shores opposed, our waves to waves, and arms to arms,"
1636,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Eternal, deadly foes through all posterity."
1637,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1638,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"The servants rush in terrified during her passionate speech, and as she"

1641,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1642,ACT IV. SCENE 3,(634-640):
1643,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1644,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Go, bring my sister Anna hither, dearest nurse:"
1645,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"In flowing water bid her haste to bathe her limbs,"
1646,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And bring the rightful sacrifices of the flock.
1647,ACT IV. SCENE 3,So let her come. And thou with pious fillets gird
1648,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Thy temples; for to Stygian Jove my mind is fixed
1649,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"To carry on the magic sacrifice begun,"
1650,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"And end my cares, and to devouring flames consign"
1651,ACT IV. SCENE 3,The relics of that cursed son of Dardanus.
1652,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1653,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Barce totters away to do her bidding. Dido takes Æneas’ mantle and sword
1654,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"from the wall, and unsheathes the sword."
1655,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1656,ACT IV. SCENE 3,(651-662):

1658,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Sweet pledges of my lord, while fate and god allowed,"
1659,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Accept this soul of mine, and free me from my cares."
1660,ACT IV. SCENE 3,For I have lived and run the course that Fortune set;
1661,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And now my stately soul to Hades shall descend.
1662,ACT IV. SCENE 3,A noble city have I built; my husband’s death
1663,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Have I avenged, and on my brother’s head my wrath"
1664,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Inflicted. Happy, ah too happy, had the keels"
1665,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Of Troy ne’er touched my shores!—And shall I perish thus?—
1666,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"But let me perish. Thus, oh thus, ‘t is sweet to seek"
1667,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"The land of shadows.—May the heartless Trojan see,"
1668,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"As on he fares across the deep, my blazing pyre,"
1669,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And bear with him the gloomy omens of my death.
1670,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1671,ACT IV. SCENE 3,She rushes forth from the chamber in her frenzy. The sailors’ chorus is
1672,ACT IV. SCENE 3,repeated fainter and fainter. In a moment her death cry is heard. The
1673,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"servants rush in, and finding their mistress gone, hasten in the"
1674,ACT IV. SCENE 3,direction of her cry. Their lamentation is heard. They return bearing
1675,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"the body of the queen upon a couch. She has fainted, and upon her bosom"
1676,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"the wound shows red and terrible. Anna enters, beside herself with"

1678,ACT IV. SCENE 3,
1679,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"_Anna_, kneeling beside the couch, addresses Dido, who revives enough to"

1682,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Was it for this, O sister, thou didst seek to hide"
1683,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Thy heart from me? Was this the meaning of the pyre,"
1684,ACT IV. SCENE 3,And this the altar fires? What plaint in my despair
1685,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"Shall I offer first? And didst thou spurn me, in thy death?"
1686,ACT IV. SCENE 3,Thou shouldst instead have bidden me to share thy fate;
1687,ACT IV. SCENE 3,The selfsame moment should have reft the lives of both.
1688,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"And with these impious hands did I thine altar rear,"
1689,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"And with this voice unto our country’s gods appeal,"
1690,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"That, heartless, I might fail thee in this final hour?"
1691,ACT IV. SCENE 3,"O sister, here hast thou destroyed thyself and me,"

1962,SCENE 2,It shall not make me false and faithless too.
1963,SCENE 2,If any chance report has touched your ears
1964,SCENE 2,"With Palamedes’ name, great Belus’ son,"

1975,SCENE 2,"And in the councils of the kings stood high,"
1976,SCENE 2,"I, too, by his reflected light, enjoyed"
1977,SCENE 2,"Both name and fair renown. But when at last,"
1978,SCENE 2,"Through false Ulysses’ murderous hate and guile,"
1979,SCENE 2,"(I speak what you do know), his death was wrought;"
1980,SCENE 2,"In deep distress, in darkness and in woe"
1981,SCENE 2,"I spent my days, and mourned the hapless fate"
1982,SCENE 2,"Of my poor friend. And, maddened by my grief,"
1983,SCENE 2,"I would not hold my peace, but loudly swore,"
1984,SCENE 2,That if the fates of war should bring me back
1985,SCENE 2,"As victor to my native land of Greece,"
1986,SCENE 2,I should full vengeance take; and by my words
1987,SCENE 2,Dire hatred ‘gainst my luckless self I roused.
1988,SCENE 2,Here was the fountain source of all my woes;
1989,SCENE 2,"From now Ulysses, crafty enemy,"
1990,SCENE 2,"Began to spread vague hints among the Greeks,"
1991,SCENE 2,"Prefer strange charges, and to seek some cause"
1992,SCENE 2,"Against me, conscious in his heart of guilt."
1993,SCENE 2,"Nor did he rest, until by Calchas’ aid—"
1994,SCENE 2,But why do I rehearse this senseless tale
1995,SCENE 2,To heedless ears? Or wherefore should I seek
1996,SCENE 2,"To stay your hands, if ‘tis enough to hear"
1997,SCENE 2,"That I am Greek, and in your hostile minds"
1998,SCENE 2,All Greeks are judged alike.
1999,SCENE 2,"Come, glut your hate"
2000,SCENE 2,Upon me. For Ulysses would rejoice
2001,SCENE 2,"To know that I am dead, and Atreus’ sons"
2002,SCENE 2,Would gladly purchase this with great reward.
2003,SCENE 2,
2004,SCENE 2,Here the stranger pauses in seeming despair and resignation to his fate.
2005,SCENE 2,The Trojans urge him to go on with his story. He resumes (108-144):
2006,SCENE 2,
2007,SCENE 2,"Full oft the Greeks, in utter weariness"
2008,SCENE 2,"Of that long siege, desired to abandon Troy,"
2009,SCENE 2,"And seek their homes again. Oh, that they had!"
2010,SCENE 2,"But whensoe’er they addressed them to the sea,"
2011,SCENE 2,Rough wintry blasts and storms affrighted them.
2012,SCENE 2,"And when this horse, of wooden timbers framed,"
2013,SCENE 2,"Completed stood, a votive offering,"
2014,SCENE 2,The winds from every quarter of the heavens
2015,SCENE 2,"Howled threateningly. To seek the will of Heaven,"
2016,SCENE 2,The anxious Greeks despatch Eurypylus
2017,SCENE 2,To Phœbus’ oracle. He straight reports
2018,SCENE 2,Apollo’s mandate grim and terrible:
2019,SCENE 2,"“Before, O Greeks, ye sailed to Troia’s shores,"
2020,SCENE 2,Ye first had need to appease the angry winds
2021,SCENE 2,With bloody sacrifice—a maiden’s death
2022,SCENE 2,"E’en so, by blood must your return be sought;"
2023,SCENE 2,Again must Grecian life atonement make.”
2024,SCENE 2,"When this dire oracle among the crowd,"
2025,SCENE 2,"From ear to ear, from lip to lip was spread,"
2026,SCENE 2,"They stood with horror stunned, and chilling fear"
2027,SCENE 2,Their inmost hearts with dire forebodings filled.
2028,SCENE 2,"They trembling ask for whom the fates prepare,"
2029,SCENE 2,Whom does Apollo seek in punishment?
2030,SCENE 2,"Then comes the Ithacan with clamor loud,"
2031,SCENE 2,"The prophet Calchas dragging in our midst,"
2032,SCENE 2,And bids with charge insistent that he tell
2033,SCENE 2,The will of heaven. And now from many lips
2034,SCENE 2,The grim forebodings of Ulysses’ guile
2035,SCENE 2,"Assail my ears, while all in silence wait"
2036,SCENE 2,"To see the end. Ten days the seer was mute,"
2037,SCENE 2,"Hid in his tent, refusing steadily"
2038,SCENE 2,By word of his to doom a man to death.
2039,SCENE 2,"At length, his feigned reluctance at an end,"
2040,SCENE 2,"And goaded by Ulysses’ clamors loud,"
2041,SCENE 2,"He spoke, and named me as the sacrifice."
2042,SCENE 2,All gave assent; and while each feared a doom
2043,SCENE 2,"Which might befall himself, they calmly bore"
2044,SCENE 2,When on my wretched head they saw it light.
2045,SCENE 2,And now the day of horror was at hand.
2046,SCENE 2,All things were ready for the sacrifice;
2047,SCENE 2,"The salted meal was sprinkled on my head,"
2048,SCENE 2,And round my brows the fatal fillets twined.
2049,SCENE 2,"Then, I confess it, did I break my bonds."
2050,SCENE 2,I fled from death and in the sedgy reeds
2051,SCENE 2,Along the muddy margin of a lake
2052,SCENE 2,"All night I lay in hiding, hoping there"
2053,SCENE 2,To lurk until their homeward sails were spread.
2054,SCENE 2,"And now my country dear I ne’er shall see,"
2055,SCENE 2,My darling children and my aged sire
2056,SCENE 2,Whose face I long to see. But they are doomed
2057,SCENE 2,"To pay the penalty which I escaped,"
2058,SCENE 2,And by their death repair this fault of mine.
2059,SCENE 2,"But by the gods above, divinities"
2060,SCENE 2,"Who with impartial eyes behold the truth,"
2061,SCENE 2,If anywhere there still abides with men
2062,SCENE 2,"Unsullied faith, I beg you, pity me"
2063,SCENE 2,"Who have endured so dire a weight of woe,"
2064,SCENE 2,A soul that has been foully overborne.
2065,SCENE 2,
2066,SCENE 2,The Trojans are moved to tears by this tale of woe; and Priam bids the
2067,SCENE 2,chains be stricken from him. He then addresses the prisoner with
2068,SCENE 2,friendly words.
2069,SCENE 2,
2070,SCENE 2,_Priam_ (148-151):
2071,SCENE 2,
2072,SCENE 2,"Whoe’er thou art, away with thoughts of Greeks."
2073,SCENE 2,"Be man of ours. And, as I question thee,"
2074,SCENE 2,Give true reply. What means this monster horse?
2075,SCENE 2,"Who first proposed, and what its purpose here?"
2076,SCENE 2,"Is it some votive gift, or does it stand"
2077,SCENE 2,Against our walls as enginery of war?
2078,SCENE 2,
2079,SCENE 2,Sinon stretches his freed hands to the heavens. He speaks excitedly and
2080,SCENE 2,as one inspired.
2081,SCENE 2,
2082,SCENE 2,_Sinon_ (154-194):
2083,SCENE 2,
2084,SCENE 2,"O ye eternal fires, be witness now,"
2085,SCENE 2,"Ye heavenly stars, divine, inviolate,"
2086,SCENE 2,"Ye cursed knives, and altars which I fled,"
2087,SCENE 2,Ye fillets which as victim doomed I wore:
2088,SCENE 2,‘Tis right for me to break all sacred oaths
2089,SCENE 2,"Which bound me to the Greeks; ‘tis right to hate,"
2090,SCENE 2,And blab their secrets to the common air.
2091,SCENE 2,I’ll not be held by any ties of land
2092,SCENE 2,"Or law. Do thou but keep thy promises,"
2093,SCENE 2,"O Troy, and, saved by me, keep plighted faith,"
2094,SCENE 2,If I with truth shall make thee rich returns.
2095,SCENE 2,
2096,SCENE 2,"Recovering himself, he goes on more quietly, and with an air of perfect"
2097,SCENE 2,sincerity.
2098,SCENE 2,
2099,SCENE 2,The Greeks’ whole hope and confidence in war
2100,SCENE 2,Had rested from the first on Pallas’ aid.
2101,SCENE 2,"But from the time when godless Diomede,"
2102,SCENE 2,"And that curst Ithacan, expert in crime,"
2103,SCENE 2,"Dared desecrate the goddess’ sacred fane,"
2104,SCENE 2,"Dared drag her mystic image forth, and kill"
2105,SCENE 2,"Her faithful guard, and on her virgin locks"
2106,SCENE 2,"Lay bloody, lustful hands unconsecrate:"
2107,SCENE 2,"From then their hopes kept ebbing back and back,"
2108,SCENE 2,Their powers were shattered and their goddess’ aid
2109,SCENE 2,Denied. And she with no uncertain signs
2110,SCENE 2,Revealed at once her outraged deity.
2111,SCENE 2,"Scarce had the sacred image reached the camp,"
2112,SCENE 2,"When glittering flames blazed from the staring eyes,"
2113,SCENE 2,And salty perspiration down her limbs
2114,SCENE 2,"Went streaming; and, oh wonderful to say,"
2115,SCENE 2,"Thrice from the ground, accoutered as she was"
2116,SCENE 2,"With shield and quivering spear, the image leaped."
2117,SCENE 2,Straitway did Calchas prophecy that all
2118,SCENE 2,Must forth again in flight upon the sea;
2119,SCENE 2,That Troy could never by Argolic arms
2120,SCENE 2,"Be overthrown, save as they back again"
2121,SCENE 2,To sacred Argos fared and there regained
2122,SCENE 2,That heavenly favor which they first had brought
2123,SCENE 2,To Ilium.
2124,SCENE 2,And now have they indeed
2125,SCENE 2,"Gone back to Greece, to seek fresh auspices,"
2126,SCENE 2,And win once more the blessing of the gods.
2127,SCENE 2,"And soon, and suddenly, the sea retraced,"
2128,SCENE 2,Will they be here again. So Calchas bade.
2129,SCENE 2,"Meanwhile, by that same prophet warned, did they"
2130,SCENE 2,This wooden image fashion to appease
2131,SCENE 2,"Th’ offended goddess, and atonement make"
2132,SCENE 2,To her outraged divinity. And more—
2133,SCENE 2,The prophet bade them form an image huge
2134,SCENE 2,"Of oaken beams, of such proportions vast"
2135,SCENE 2,"That through no gate of Troy could it be led,"
2136,SCENE 2,"Nor set within the walls, lest thus once more"
2137,SCENE 2,The people from their ancient deity
2138,SCENE 2,Protection find. For if Minerva’s gift
2139,SCENE 2,"Should by your hands be desecrated, then"
2140,SCENE 2,Would dreadful doom (Heaven send it on _their_ heads)
2141,SCENE 2,Upon old Priam and his Phrygians come;
2142,SCENE 2,But if within your walls this sacred horse
2143,SCENE 2,"Should by your voluntary hands be set,"
2144,SCENE 2,"Then would all Asia rise with one accord,"
2145,SCENE 2,"And sweep in mighty war against the Greeks,"
2146,SCENE 2,And that dire doom upon our grandsons fall.

2148,SCENE 2,
2149,SCENE 3,SCENE 3
2150,SCENE 3,
2151,SCENE 3,The Trojans are entirely satisfied with this explanation and treat Sinon
2152,SCENE 3,"with respectful consideration. At this juncture, two huge serpents come"
2153,SCENE 3,"up out of the sea, and, while the people flee shrieking away on all"
2154,SCENE 3,"sides, they make their way to Laocoön where he stands sacrificing at the"
2155,SCENE 3,"altar, and enfold him and his two sons in their deadly coils (195-227)."
2156,SCENE 3,
2157,SCENE 3,
2158,SCENE 4,SCENE 4
2159,SCENE 4,
2160,SCENE 4,"Great excitement follows. People say that Laocoön has perished justly,"
2161,SCENE 4,"since he impiously violated the sacred horse, and loudly demand that the"
2162,SCENE 4,creature be taken within the walls (228-249):
2163,SCENE 4,
2164,SCENE 4,_A voice from the crowd_:
2165,SCENE 4,
2166,SCENE 4,"Oh, dreadful punishment, but well deserved,"
2167,SCENE 4,"For with his impious spear he smote the oak,"
2168,SCENE 4,The sacred wood to Pallas consecrate.
2169,SCENE 4,
2170,SCENE 4,_Another voice_:
2171,SCENE 4,
2172,SCENE 4,Now haste we and within our city lead
2173,SCENE 4,"This horse portentous, and with humble prayer"
2174,SCENE 4,Minerva’s aid and pardoning favor seek.
2175,SCENE 4,
2176,SCENE 4,"They hastily enlarge the gate, attach ropes to the horse, and put"
2177,SCENE 4,"rollers under its feet, many willing hands lay hold of the ropes and"
2178,SCENE 4,pull the horse along. Boys and girls dance and sing around the workers.
2179,SCENE 4,"The horse sticks at the threshold of the gate, and Cassandra, who has"
2180,SCENE 4,"been looking on as one entranced, cries out forebodingly."
2181,SCENE 4,
2182,SCENE 4,_Cassandra_:
2183,SCENE 4,
2184,SCENE 4,"O fatherland! O Ilium, home of gods!"
2185,SCENE 4,"Ye walls of Troy, in war illustrious!"
2186,SCENE 4,"See there, upon the threshold of the gate,"
2187,SCENE 4,The monster halts—again—and yet again!
2188,SCENE 4,And from its rumbling hold I hear the sound
2189,SCENE 4,Of clashing arms! O Troy! O fatherland!
2190,SCENE 4,
2191,SCENE 4,"But the people, not heeding her, press on and disappear within the city"
2192,SCENE 4,"walls with the wooden horse, on the way to the citadel. Everywhere are"
2193,SCENE 4,heard sounds of delirious joy.

2290,SCENE 2,
2291,SCENE 2,The little band hurries off toward the noise of battle in neighboring

2293,SCENE 2,"drunk with victory. They burn and pillage on all sides, temples and"
2294,SCENE 2,"homes alike. Re-enter Trojans led by Æneas. Androgeos, a Greek, thinking"

2315,SCENE 2,Our foes against themselves shall lend us arms.
2316,SCENE 2,
2317,SCENE 2,"They exchange arms with the dead Greeks. Thus arrayed, they mingle with"
2318,SCENE 2,"the parties of Greeks who straggle in, and slay them. The Greeks, not"

2320,SCENE 2,action is repeated at intervals several times.
2321,SCENE 2,
2322,SCENE 2,"Enter a band of Greeks led by Ajax, the Atridæ, and others, dragging"

2324,SCENE 2,"Corœbus, though the odds are overwhelmingly against him, rushes in to"
2325,SCENE 2,"save his beloved Cassandra. The other Trojans, because of their disguise"
2326,SCENE 2,"of Greek armor, are attacked by their own friends stationed at near by"
2327,SCENE 2,"points of vantage, and now the Greeks themselves, recognizing the ruse"
2328,SCENE 2,"at last, overwhelm the little Trojan band by force of numbers. Other"
2329,SCENE 2,Greeks pour in from all sides and add their testimony that these are
2330,SCENE 2,Trojans. In the desperate encounter many of the Trojans fall.
2331,SCENE 2,
2332,SCENE 2,"Æneas performs Herculean feats of arms, and slays many Greeks, but is"
2333,SCENE 2,himself unhurt. At last he and a few followers escape into a street

2343,SCENE 3,"hurl down upon these darts and stones, and pry off whole towers which"
2344,SCENE 3,fall with a mighty crash. The air is filled with the thunderous noise of
2345,SCENE 3,these falling masses and with the other confused shouts and sounds of a
2346,SCENE 3,desperate conflict.
2347,SCENE 3,
2348,SCENE 3,(_b_) Pyrrhus with a strong band of Greeks is endeavoring to batter down

2356,SCENE 4,despair. A crowded mass of men are attempting to defend the main
2357,SCENE 4,entrance. Overhead can be seen and heard the defenders on the roof
2358,SCENE 4,opposing the attack from without.
2359,SCENE 4,
2360,SCENE 4,"In the central open court of the palace, upon the steps of a great altar"

2362,SCENE 4,"themselves, huddling there in the hope of protection from the sanctity"
2363,SCENE 4,"of the altar. Suddenly old Priam comes out into the court, hurriedly"

2365,SCENE 4,
2366,SCENE 4,"_Hecuba_, calling to him (519-524):"

2371,SCENE 4,Such aid and such defense as thou canst give
2372,SCENE 4,"Cannot avail us now, nor Hector’s self,"
2373,SCENE 4,Could he come back to us. Come hither then;
2374,SCENE 4,"These sacred altar stairs shall shield us all,"
2375,SCENE 4,Or in their sight will we together die.

2391,SCENE 4,"Who care for men, to grant thee dire return,"
2392,SCENE 4,And give thee what thou hast so richly earned.
2393,SCENE 4,"For thou hast slain my son before my face,"
2394,SCENE 4,And with his blood defiled his father’s eyes.
2395,SCENE 4,"But that Achilles, whom thou falsely claim’st"
2396,SCENE 4,"As sire, did not so treat his royal foe,"
2397,SCENE 4,But held in reverence the sacred laws.

2399,SCENE 4,And sent me back in safety to my home.
2400,SCENE 4,

2648,SCENE 2,"_Anchises_, peering in the direction of the sound (733, 734):"

2662,SCENE 3,"about him, counting and identifying them. He now discovers that Creüsa"
2663,SCENE 3,is missing.
2664,SCENE 3,
2665,SCENE 3,_Æneas_ (738-748):

2669,SCENE 3,"Hast wandered from the way, or, spent with toil,"
2670,SCENE 3,Hast thou given o’er the journey? Woe is me!

2672,SCENE 3,What god or man is guilty of this crime?
2673,SCENE 3,Or what more cruel deed have I beheld

2678,SCENE 3,"Behold, my friends,"
2679,SCENE 3,To you my son and sire and household gods

2693,SCENE 4,
2694,SCENE 4,_The Ghost of Creüsa_ (776-789):
2695,SCENE 4,
2696,SCENE 4,"What boots it to indulge this storm of grief,"
2697,SCENE 4,"O dearest husband? For be sure of this,"
2698,SCENE 4,That not without permission of the gods
2699,SCENE 4,Have these things come to pass. ‘Twas not allowed
2700,SCENE 4,"That thy Creüsa should go hence with thee,"
2701,SCENE 4,Nor does Olympus’ ruler suffer it.
2702,SCENE 4,"To distant lands, long exiled must thou roam,"
2703,SCENE 4,"Must plow the water of the vasty deep,"
2704,SCENE 4,"Until thou come to that far western land,"
2705,SCENE 4,Where Lydian Tiber’s gently murmuring stream
2706,SCENE 4,Rolls down through rich and cultivated fields.
2707,SCENE 4,"There joyful state and kingdom wait for thee,"
2708,SCENE 4,There one who is allotted for thy wife.
2709,SCENE 4,Then dry the tears which now affection sheds
2710,SCENE 4,"For thy well-loved Creüsa, once thy wife;"
2711,SCENE 4,For ‘tis not mine to see the haughty seats
2712,SCENE 4,Of Myrmidonian or Dolopian foes;
