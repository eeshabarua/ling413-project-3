73,CANTO I,
74,CANTO I,
75,CANTO I,1
76,CANTO I,
77,CANTO I,"You stranger, long before your glance can light"
78,CANTO I,"Upon these words, time will have washed away"
79,CANTO I,"The moment when I first took pen to write,"
80,CANTO I,"With all my road before me--yet to-day,"
81,CANTO I,"Here, if at all, we meet; the unfashioned clay"
82,CANTO I,Ready to both our hands; both hushed to see
83,CANTO I,That which is nowhere yet come forth and be.
84,CANTO I,
85,CANTO I,
86,CANTO I,2
87,CANTO I,
88,CANTO I,"This moment, if you join me, we begin"
89,CANTO I,A partnership where both must toil to hold
90,CANTO I,The clue that I caught first. We lose or win
91,CANTO I,"Together; if you read, you are enrolled."
92,CANTO I,"And first, a marvel--Who could have foretold"
93,CANTO I,That in the city which men called in scorn
94,CANTO I,"The Perfect City, Dymer could be born?"
95,CANTO I,
96,CANTO I,
97,CANTO I,3
98,CANTO I,
99,CANTO I,There you’d have thought the gods were smothered down
100,CANTO I,"Forever, and the keys were turned on fate."
101,CANTO I,"No hour was left unchartered in that town,"
102,CANTO I,And love was in a schedule and the State
103,CANTO I,Chose for eugenic reasons who should mate
104,CANTO I,"With whom, and when. Each idle song and dance"
105,CANTO I,Was fixed by law and nothing left to chance.
106,CANTO I,
107,CANTO I,
108,CANTO I,4
109,CANTO I,
110,CANTO I,For some of the last Platonists had founded
111,CANTO I,That city of old. And mastery they made
112,CANTO I,"An island of what ought to be, surrounded"
113,CANTO I,By this gross world of easier light and shade.
114,CANTO I,All answering to the master’s dream they laid
115,CANTO I,"The strong foundations, torturing into stone"
116,CANTO I,Each bubble that the Academy had blown.
117,CANTO I,
118,CANTO I,
119,CANTO I,5
120,CANTO I,
121,CANTO I,"This people were so pure, so law-abiding,"
122,CANTO I,"So logical, they made the heavens afraid:"
123,CANTO I,They sent the very swallows into hiding
124,CANTO I,By their appalling chastity dismayed:
125,CANTO I,More soberly the lambs in springtime played
126,CANTO I,Because of them: and ghosts dissolved in shame
127,CANTO I,Before their common-sense--till Dymer came.
128,CANTO I,
129,CANTO I,
130,CANTO I,6
131,CANTO I,
132,CANTO I,"At Dymer’s birth no comets scared the nation,"
133,CANTO I,"The public crèche engulfed him with the rest,"
134,CANTO I,And twenty separate Boards of Education
135,CANTO I,"Closed round him. He was passed through every test,"
136,CANTO I,"Was vaccinated, numbered, washed and dressed,"
137,CANTO I,"Proctored, inspected, whipt, examined weekly,"
138,CANTO I,And for some nineteen years he bore it meekly.
139,CANTO I,
140,CANTO I,
141,CANTO I,7
142,CANTO I,
143,CANTO I,"For nineteen years they worked upon his soul,"
144,CANTO I,"Refining, chipping, moulding and adorning."
145,CANTO I,Then came the moment that undid the whole--
146,CANTO I,The ripple of rude life without a warning.
147,CANTO I,It came in lecture-time one April morning
148,CANTO I,"--Alas for laws and locks, reproach and praise,"
149,CANTO I,Who ever learned to censor the spring days?
150,CANTO I,
151,CANTO I,
152,CANTO I,8
153,CANTO I,
154,CANTO I,A little breeze came stirring to his cheek.
155,CANTO I,He looked up to the window. A brown bird
156,CANTO I,"Perched on the sill, bent down to whet his beak"
157,CANTO I,With darting head--Poor Dymer watched and stirred
158,CANTO I,Uneasily. The lecturer’s voice he heard
159,CANTO I,Still droning from the dais. The narrow room
160,CANTO I,"Was drowsy, over-solemn, filled with gloom."
161,CANTO I,
162,CANTO I,
163,CANTO I,9
164,CANTO I,
165,CANTO I,"He yawned, and a voluptuous laziness"
166,CANTO I,"Tingled down all his spine and loosed his knees,"
167,CANTO I,"Slow-drawn, like an invisible caress."
168,CANTO I,He laughed--The lecturer stopped like one that sees
169,CANTO I,"A Ghost, then frowned and murmured, “Silence, please.”"
170,CANTO I,That moment saw the soul of Dymer hang
171,CANTO I,In the balance--Louder then his laughter rang.
172,CANTO I,
173,CANTO I,
174,CANTO I,10
175,CANTO I,
176,CANTO I,"The whole room watched with unbelieving awe,"
177,CANTO I,He rose and staggered rising. From his lips
178,CANTO I,Broke yet again the idiot-like guffaw.
179,CANTO I,"He felt the spirit in his finger-tips,"
180,CANTO I,Then swinging his right arm--a wide ellipse
181,CANTO I,Yet lazily--he struck the lecturer’s head.
182,CANTO I,"The old man tittered, lurched and dropt down dead."
183,CANTO I,
184,CANTO I,
185,CANTO I,11
186,CANTO I,
187,CANTO I,"Out of the silent room, out of the dark"
188,CANTO I,"Into the sum-stream Dymer passed, and there"
189,CANTO I,"The sudden breezes, the high hanging lark"
190,CANTO I,"The milk-white clouds sailing in polished air,"
191,CANTO I,Suddenly flashed about him like a blare
192,CANTO I,Of trumpets. And no cry was raised behind him.
193,CANTO I,His class sat dazed. They dared not go to find him.
194,CANTO I,
195,CANTO I,
196,CANTO I,12
197,CANTO I,
198,CANTO I,Yet wonderfully some rumour spread abroad--
199,CANTO I,An inarticulate sense of life renewing
200,CANTO I,In each young heart--He whistled down the road:
201,CANTO I,"Men said: “There’s Dymer”--“Why, what’s Dymer doing?”"
202,CANTO I,"“I don’t know”--“Look, there’s Dymer,”--far pursuing"
203,CANTO I,With troubled eyes--A long mysterious “Oh”
204,CANTO I,Sighed from a hundred throats to see him go.
205,CANTO I,
206,CANTO I,
207,CANTO I,13
208,CANTO I,
209,CANTO I,Down the white street and past the gate and forth
210,CANTO I,Beyond the wall he came to grassy places.
211,CANTO I,There was a shifting wind to West and North
212,CANTO I,With clouds in heeling squadron running races.
213,CANTO I,The shadows following on the sunlight’s traces
214,CANTO I,Crossed the whole field and each wild flower within it
215,CANTO I,With change of wavering glories every minute.
216,CANTO I,
217,CANTO I,
218,CANTO I,14
219,CANTO I,
220,CANTO I,"There was a river, flushed with rains, between"
221,CANTO I,The flat fields and a forest’s willowy edge.
222,CANTO I,"A sauntering pace he shuffled on the green,"
223,CANTO I,He kicked his boots against the crackly sedge
224,CANTO I,And tore his hands in many a furzy hedge.
225,CANTO I,He saw his feet and ankles gilded round
226,CANTO I,With buttercups that carpeted the ground.
227,CANTO I,
228,CANTO I,
229,CANTO I,15
230,CANTO I,
231,CANTO I,He looked back then. The line of a low hill
232,CANTO I,Had hid the city’s towers and domes from sight;
233,CANTO I,He stopt: he felt a break of sunlight spill
234,CANTO I,Around him sudden waves of searching light.
235,CANTO I,"Upon the earth was green, and gold, and white"
236,CANTO I,Smothering his feet. He felt his city dress
237,CANTO I,An insult to that April cheerfulness.
238,CANTO I,
239,CANTO I,
240,CANTO I,16
241,CANTO I,
242,CANTO I,"He said: “I’ve worn this dust heap long enough,"
243,CANTO I,Here goes!” And forthwith in the open field
244,CANTO I,He stripped away that prison of sad stuff:
245,CANTO I,"Socks, jacket, shirt and breeches off he peeled"
246,CANTO I,And rose up mother-naked with no shield
247,CANTO I,Against the sun: then stood awhile to play
248,CANTO I,With bare toes dabbling in cold river clay.
249,CANTO I,
250,CANTO I,
251,CANTO I,17
252,CANTO I,
253,CANTO I,"Forward again, and sometimes leaping high"
254,CANTO I,With arms outspread as though he would embrace
255,CANTO I,In one act all the circle of the sky:
256,CANTO I,"Sometimes he rested in a leafier place,"
257,CANTO I,"And crushed the wet, cool flowers against his face:"
258,CANTO I,"And once he cried aloud, “Oh world, oh day,"
259,CANTO I,"Let, let me,”--and then found no prayer to say."
260,CANTO I,
261,CANTO I,
262,CANTO I,18
263,CANTO I,
264,CANTO I,Up furrows still unpierced with earliest crop
265,CANTO I,"He marched. Through woods he strolled from flower to flower,"
266,CANTO I,And over hills. As ointment drop by drop
267,CANTO I,"Preciously meted out, so hour by hour"
268,CANTO I,The day slipped through his hands: and now the power
269,CANTO I,"Failed in his feet from walking. He was done,"
270,CANTO I,Hungry and cold. That moment sank the sun.
271,CANTO I,
272,CANTO I,
273,CANTO I,19
274,CANTO I,
275,CANTO I,"He lingered--Looking up, he saw ahead"
276,CANTO I,The black and bristling frontage of a wood
277,CANTO I,And over it the large sky swimming red
278,CANTO I,Freckled with homeward crows. Surprised he stood
279,CANTO I,"To feel that wideness quenching his hot mood,"
280,CANTO I,"Then shouted, “Trembling darkness, trembling green,"
281,CANTO I,"What do you mean, wild wood, what do you mean?”"
282,CANTO I,
283,CANTO I,
284,CANTO I,20
285,CANTO I,
286,CANTO I,He shouted. But the solitude received
287,CANTO I,"His noise into her noiselessness, his fire"
288,CANTO I,Into her calm. Perhaps he half believed
289,CANTO I,Some answer yet would come to his desire.
290,CANTO I,The hushed air quivered softly like a wire
291,CANTO I,"Upon his voice. It echoed, it was gone:"
292,CANTO I,The quiet and the quiet dark went on.
293,CANTO I,
294,CANTO I,
295,CANTO I,21
296,CANTO I,
297,CANTO I,He rushed into the wood. He struck and stumbled
298,CANTO I,On hidden roots. He groped and scratched his face.
299,CANTO I,The little birds woke chattering where he fumbled.
300,CANTO I,"The stray cat stood, paw lifted, in mid-chase."
301,CANTO I,There is a windless calm in such a place.
302,CANTO I,A sense of being indoors--so crowded stand
303,CANTO I,"The living trees, watching on every hand:"
304,CANTO I,
305,CANTO I,
306,CANTO I,22
307,CANTO I,
308,CANTO I,A sense of trespass--such as in the hall
309,CANTO I,"Of the wrong house, one time, to me befell."
310,CANTO I,Groping between the hatstand and the wall--
311,CANTO I,"A clear voice from above me like a bell,"
312,CANTO I,The sweet voice of a woman asking “Well?”
313,CANTO I,No more than this. And as I fled I wondered
314,CANTO I,Into whose alien story I had blundered.
315,CANTO I,
316,CANTO I,
317,CANTO I,23
318,CANTO I,
319,CANTO I,"A like thing fell to Dymer. Bending low,"
320,CANTO I,Feeling his way he went. The curtained air
321,CANTO I,"Sighed into sound above his head, as though"
322,CANTO I,Stringed instruments and horns were riding there.
323,CANTO I,It passed and at its passing stirred his hair.
324,CANTO I,He stood intent to hear. He heard again
325,CANTO I,"And checked his breath half-drawn, as if with pain."
326,CANTO I,
327,CANTO I,
328,CANTO I,24
329,CANTO I,
330,CANTO I,That music could have crumbled proud belief
331,CANTO I,"With doubt, or in the bosom of the sage"
332,CANTO I,"Madden the heart that had outmastered grief,"
333,CANTO I,And flood with tears the eyes of frozen age
334,CANTO I,And turn the young man’s feet to pilgrimage--
335,CANTO I,"So sharp it was, so sure a path it found,"
336,CANTO I,Soulward with stabbing wounds of bitter sound.
337,CANTO I,
338,CANTO I,
339,CANTO I,25
340,CANTO I,
341,CANTO I,"It died out on the middle of a note,"
342,CANTO I,As though it failed at the urge of its own meaning.
343,CANTO I,"It left him with life quivering at the throat,"
344,CANTO I,"Limbs shaken and wet cheeks and body leaning,"
345,CANTO I,With strain towards the sound and senses gleaning
346,CANTO I,"The last, least, ebbing ripple of the air,"
347,CANTO I,"Searching the emptied darkness, muttering “Where?”"
348,CANTO I,
349,CANTO I,
350,CANTO I,26
351,CANTO I,
352,CANTO I,Then followed such a time as is forgotten
353,CANTO I,"With morning light, but in the passing seems"
354,CANTO I,"Unending. Where he grasped the branch was rotten,"
355,CANTO I,Where he trod forth in haste the forest streams
356,CANTO I,Laid wait for him. Like men in fever dreams
357,CANTO I,"Climbing an endless rope, he laboured much"
358,CANTO I,And gained no ground. He reached and could not touch.
359,CANTO I,
360,CANTO I,
361,CANTO I,27
362,CANTO I,
363,CANTO I,And often out of darkness like a swell
364,CANTO I,"That grows up from no wind upon blue sea,"
365,CANTO I,"He heard the music, unendurable"
366,CANTO I,In stealing sweetness wind from tree to tree.
367,CANTO I,Battered and bruised in body and soul was he
368,CANTO I,When first he saw a little lightness growing
369,CANTO I,Ahead: and from that light the sound was flowing.
370,CANTO I,
371,CANTO I,
372,CANTO I,28
373,CANTO I,
374,CANTO I,The trees were fewer now: and gladly nearing
375,CANTO I,"That light, he saw the stars. For sky was there,"
376,CANTO I,"And smoother grass, white flowered--a forest clearing"
377,CANTO I,"Set in seven miles of forest, secreter"
378,CANTO I,"Than valleys in the tops of clouds, more fair"
379,CANTO I,Than greenery under snow or desert water
380,CANTO I,Or the white peace descending after slaughter.
381,CANTO I,
382,CANTO I,
383,CANTO I,29
384,CANTO I,
385,CANTO I,As some who have been wounded beyond healing
386,CANTO I,"Wake, or half wake, once only and so bless"
387,CANTO I,Far off the lamplight travelling on the ceiling.
388,CANTO I,A disk of pale light filled with peacefulness
389,CANTO I,"And wonder if this is the C.C.S.,"
390,CANTO I,"Or home, or heaven, or dreams--then sighing win"
391,CANTO I,"Wise, ignorant death before the pains begin:"
392,CANTO I,
393,CANTO I,
394,CANTO I,30
395,CANTO I,
396,CANTO I,"So Dymer in the wood-lawn blessed the light,"
397,CANTO I,"A still light, rosy, clear, and filled with sound."
398,CANTO I,Here was some pile of building which the night
399,CANTO I,"Made larger. Spiry shadows rose all round,"
400,CANTO I,But through the open door appeared profound
401,CANTO I,Recesses of pure light--fire with no flame--
402,CANTO I,And out of that deep light the music came.
403,CANTO I,
404,CANTO I,
405,CANTO I,31
406,CANTO I,
407,CANTO I,Tip-toes he slunk towards it where the grass
408,CANTO I,Was twinkling in a lane of light before
409,CANTO I,The archway. There was neither fence to pass
410,CANTO I,"Nor word of challenge given, nor bolted door,"
411,CANTO I,"But where it’s open, open evermore,"
412,CANTO I,"No knocker and no porter and no guard,"
413,CANTO I,For very strangeness entering in grows hard.
414,CANTO I,
415,CANTO I,
416,CANTO I,32
417,CANTO I,
418,CANTO I,"Breathe not! Speak not! Walk gently. Someone’s here,"
419,CANTO I,Why have they left their house with the door so wide?
420,CANTO I,There must be someone.... Dymer hung in fear
421,CANTO I,"Upon the threshold, longing and big-eyed."
422,CANTO I,"At last he squared his shoulders, smote his side"
423,CANTO I,"And called, “I’m here. Now let the feast begin."
424,CANTO I,"I’m coming now. I’m Dymer,” and went in."
425,CANTO I,
426,CANTO I,
427,CANTO I,
428,CANTO I,
429,CANTO II,CANTO II
430,CANTO II,
431,CANTO II,
432,CANTO II,1
433,CANTO II,
434,CANTO II,"More light. Another step, and still more light"
435,CANTO II,"Opening ahead. It swilled with soft excess,"
436,CANTO II,"His eyes yet quivering from the dregs of night,"
437,CANTO II,And it was nowhere more and nowhere less:
438,CANTO II,In it no shadows were. He could not guess
439,CANTO II,Its fountain. Wondering round around he turned:
440,CANTO II,Still on each side the level glory burned.
441,CANTO II,
442,CANTO II,
443,CANTO II,2
444,CANTO II,
445,CANTO II,Far in the dome to where his gaze was lost
446,CANTO II,The deepening roof shone clear as stones that lie
447,CANTO II,"In-shore beneath pure seas. The aisles, that crossed"
448,CANTO II,"Like forests of white stone their arms on high,"
449,CANTO II,Past pillar after pillar dragged his eye
450,CANTO II,In unobscured perspective till the sight
451,CANTO II,Was weary. And there also was the light.
452,CANTO II,
453,CANTO II,
454,CANTO II,3
455,CANTO II,
456,CANTO II,Look with my eyes. Conceive yourself above
457,CANTO II,And hanging in the dome: and thence through space
458,CANTO II,"Look down. See Dymer, dwarfed and naked, move,"
459,CANTO II,"A white blot on the floor, at such a pace"
460,CANTO II,As boats that hardly seem to have changed place
461,CANTO II,Once in an hour when from the cliffs we spy
462,CANTO II,The same ship always smoking towards the sky.
463,CANTO II,
464,CANTO II,
465,CANTO II,4
466,CANTO II,
467,CANTO II,The shouting mood had withered from his heart;
468,CANTO II,The oppression of huge places wrapped him round.
469,CANTO II,A great misgiving sent its fluttering dart
470,CANTO II,"Deep into him--some fear of being found,"
471,CANTO II,Some hope to find he knew not what. The sound
472,CANTO II,"Of music, never ceasing, took the rôle"
473,CANTO II,Of silence and like silence numbed his soul.
474,CANTO II,
475,CANTO II,
476,CANTO II,5
477,CANTO II,
478,CANTO II,"Till, as he turned a corner, his deep awe"
479,CANTO II,"Broke with a sudden start. For straight ahead,"
480,CANTO II,"Far off, a wild eyed, naked man he saw"
481,CANTO II,That came to meet him: and beyond was spread
482,CANTO II,Yet further depth of light. With quickening tread
483,CANTO II,He leaped towards the shape. Then stopped and smiled
484,CANTO II,"Before a mirror, wondering like a child."
485,CANTO II,
486,CANTO II,
487,CANTO II,6
488,CANTO II,
489,CANTO II,"Beside the glass, unguarded, for the claiming,"
490,CANTO II,Like a great patch of flowers upon the wall
491,CANTO II,"Hung every kind of clothes: silk, feathers flaming,"
492,CANTO II,"Leopard skin, furry mantles like the fall"
493,CANTO II,Of deep mid-winter snows. Upon them all
494,CANTO II,"Hung the faint smell of cedar, and the dyes"
495,CANTO II,Were bright as blood and clear as morning skies.
496,CANTO II,
497,CANTO II,
498,CANTO II,7
499,CANTO II,
500,CANTO II,He turned from the white spectre in the glass
501,CANTO II,"And looked at these. Remember, he had worn"
502,CANTO II,"Thro’ winter slush, thro’ summer flowers and grass"
503,CANTO II,"One kind of solemn stuff since he was born,"
504,CANTO II,With badge of year and rank. He laughed in scorn
505,CANTO II,"And cried, “Here is no law, nor eye to see,"
506,CANTO II,Nor leave of entry given. Why should there be?
507,CANTO II,
508,CANTO II,
509,CANTO II,8
510,CANTO II,
511,CANTO II,“Have done with that--you threw it all behind.
512,CANTO II,Henceforth I ask no licence where I need.
513,CANTO II,"It’s on, on, on, though I go mad and blind,"
514,CANTO II,"Though knees ache and lungs labour and feet bleed,"
515,CANTO II,"Or else--it’s home again: to sleep and feed,"
516,CANTO II,"And work, and hate them always and obey"
517,CANTO II,And loathe the punctual rise of each new day.”
518,CANTO II,
519,CANTO II,
520,CANTO II,9
521,CANTO II,
522,CANTO II,"He made mad work among them as he dressed,"
523,CANTO II,"With motley choice and litter on the floor,"
524,CANTO II,And each thing as he found it seemed the best.
525,CANTO II,He wondered that he had not known before
526,CANTO II,How fair a man he was. “I’ll creep no more
527,CANTO II,"In secret,” Dymer said. “But I’ll go back"
528,CANTO II,And drive them all to freedom on this track.”
529,CANTO II,
530,CANTO II,
531,CANTO II,10
532,CANTO II,
533,CANTO II,He turned towards the glass. The space looked smaller
534,CANTO II,Behind him now. Himself in royal guise
535,CANTO II,"Filled the whole frame--a nobler shape and taller,"
536,CANTO II,"Till suddenly he started with surprise,"
537,CANTO II,"Catching, by chance, his own familiar eyes,"
538,CANTO II,"Fevered, yet still the same, without their share"
539,CANTO II,"Of bravery, undeceived and watching there."
540,CANTO II,
541,CANTO II,
542,CANTO II,11
543,CANTO II,
544,CANTO II,"Yet, as he turned, he cried, “The rest remain...."
545,CANTO II,"If they rebelled ... if they should find me here,"
546,CANTO II,"We’d pluck the whole taut fabric from the strain,"
547,CANTO II,"Hew down the city, let live earth appear!"
548,CANTO II,--Old men and barren women whom through fear
549,CANTO II,"We have suffered to be masters in our home,"
550,CANTO II,Hide! hide! for we are angry and we come.”
551,CANTO II,
552,CANTO II,
553,CANTO II,12
554,CANTO II,
555,CANTO II,"Thus feeding on vain fancy, covering round"
556,CANTO II,"His hunger, his great loneliness arraying"
557,CANTO II,"In facile dreams until the qualm was drowned,"
558,CANTO II,The boy went on. Through endless arches straying
559,CANTO II,"With casual tread he sauntered, manly playing"
560,CANTO II,"At manhood lest more loss of faith betide him,"
561,CANTO II,Till lo! he saw a table set beside him.
562,CANTO II,
563,CANTO II,
564,CANTO II,13
565,CANTO II,
566,CANTO II,"When Dymer saw this sight, he leaped for mirth,"
567,CANTO II,"He clapped his hands, his eye lit like a lover’s."
568,CANTO II,He had a hunger in him that was worth
569,CANTO II,"Ten cities. Here was silver, glass and covers."
570,CANTO II,"Cold peacock, prauns in aspic, eggs of plovers,"
571,CANTO II,"Raised pies that stood like castles, gleaming fishes"
572,CANTO II,And bright fruit with broad leaves around the dishes.
573,CANTO II,
574,CANTO II,
575,CANTO II,14
576,CANTO II,
577,CANTO II,If ever you have passed a café door
578,CANTO II,"And lingered in the dusk of a June day,"
579,CANTO II,"Fresh from the road, sweat-sodden and foot-sore,"
580,CANTO II,"And heard the plates clink and the music play,"
581,CANTO II,"With laughter, with white tables far away,"
582,CANTO II,With many lights--conceive how Dymer ran
583,CANTO II,"To table, looked once round him, and began."
584,CANTO II,
585,CANTO II,
586,CANTO II,15
587,CANTO II,
588,CANTO II,That table seemed unending. Here and there
589,CANTO II,"Were broken meats, bread crumbled, flowers defaced"
590,CANTO II,"--A napkin, with white petals, on a chair,"
591,CANTO II,"--A glass already tasted, still to taste."
592,CANTO II,It seemed that a great host had fed in haste
593,CANTO II,And gone: yet left a thousand places more
594,CANTO II,"Untouched, wherein no guest had sat before."
595,CANTO II,
596,CANTO II,
597,CANTO II,16
598,CANTO II,
599,CANTO II,"There in the lonely splendour Dymer ate,"
600,CANTO II,"As thieves eat, ever watching, half in fear."
601,CANTO II,He blamed his evil fortune. “I come late.
602,CANTO II,Whose board was this? What company sat here?
603,CANTO II,"What women with wise mouths, what comrades dear"
604,CANTO II,Who would have made me welcome as the one
605,CANTO II,"Free-born of all my race and cried, ‘Well done!’”"
606,CANTO II,
607,CANTO II,
608,CANTO II,17
609,CANTO II,
610,CANTO II,"Remember, yet again, he had grown up"
611,CANTO II,"On rations and on scientific food,"
612,CANTO II,"At common boards, with water in his cup,"
613,CANTO II,One mess alike for every day and mood:
614,CANTO II,"But here, at his right hand, a flagon stood."
615,CANTO II,"He raised it, paused before he drank, and laughed."
616,CANTO II,“I’ll drown their Perfect City in this draught.”
617,CANTO II,
618,CANTO II,
619,CANTO II,18
620,CANTO II,
621,CANTO II,"He fingered the cold neck. He saw within,"
622,CANTO II,"Like a strange sky, some liquor that foamed blue"
623,CANTO II,And murmured. Standing now with pointed chin
624,CANTO II,"And head thrown back, he tasted. Rapture flew"
625,CANTO II,Through every vein. That moment louder grew
626,CANTO II,The music and swelled forth a trumpet note.
627,CANTO II,He ceased and put one hand up to his throat.
628,CANTO II,
629,CANTO II,
630,CANTO II,19
631,CANTO II,
632,CANTO II,Then heedlessly he let the flagon sink
633,CANTO II,In his right hand. His staring eyes were caught
634,CANTO II,"In distance, as of one who tries to think"
635,CANTO II,A thought that is still waiting to be thought.
636,CANTO II,There was a riot in his heart that brought
637,CANTO II,The loud blood to the temples. A great voice
638,CANTO II,"Sprang to his lips unsummoned, with no choice."
639,CANTO II,
640,CANTO II,
641,CANTO II,20
642,CANTO II,
643,CANTO II,"“Ah! but the eyes are open, the dream is broken!"
644,CANTO II,To sack the Perfect City?... a fool’s deed
645,CANTO II,For Dymer! Folly of follies I have spoken!
646,CANTO II,"I am the wanderer, new born, newly freed...."
647,CANTO II,A thousand times they have warned me of men’s greed
648,CANTO II,"For joy, for the good that all desire, but never"
649,CANTO II,Till now I knew the wild heat of the endeavour.
650,CANTO II,
651,CANTO II,
652,CANTO II,21
653,CANTO II,
654,CANTO II,"“Some day I will come back to break the City,"
655,CANTO II,--Not now. Perhaps when age is white and bleak
656,CANTO II,"--Not now. I am in haste. Oh God, the pity"
657,CANTO II,"Of all my life till this, groping and weak,"
658,CANTO II,The shadow of itself! But now to seek
659,CANTO II,That true most ancient glory whose white glance
660,CANTO II,Was lost through the whole world by evil chance!
661,CANTO II,
662,CANTO II,
663,CANTO II,22
664,CANTO II,
665,CANTO II,"“I was a dull, cowed thing from the beginning."
666,CANTO II,"Dymer the drudge, the blackleg who obeyed."
667,CANTO II,"Desire shall teach me now. If this be sinning,"
668,CANTO II,"Good luck to it! Oh splendour long delayed,"
669,CANTO II,"Beautiful world of mine, oh world arrayed"
670,CANTO II,"For bridal, flower and forest, wave and field,"
671,CANTO II,"I come to be your lover. Loveliest, yield!"
672,CANTO II,
673,CANTO II,
674,CANTO II,23
675,CANTO II,
676,CANTO II,"“World, I will prove you. Lest it should be said"
677,CANTO II,There was a man who loved the earth: his heart
678,CANTO II,Was nothing but that love. With doting tread
679,CANTO II,He worshipt the loved grass: and every start
680,CANTO II,"Of every bird from cover, the least part"
681,CANTO II,Of every flower he held in awe. Yet earth
682,CANTO II,Gave him no joy between his death and birth.
683,CANTO II,
684,CANTO II,
685,CANTO II,24
686,CANTO II,
687,CANTO II,“I know my good is hidden at your breast.
688,CANTO II,"There is a sound of great good in my ear,"
689,CANTO II,"Like wings. And, oh! this moment is the best;"
690,CANTO II,I shall not fail--I taste it--it comes near.
691,CANTO II,As men from a dark dungeon see the clear
692,CANTO II,"Stars shining and the filled streams far away,"
693,CANTO II,I hear your promise booming and obey.
694,CANTO II,
695,CANTO II,
696,CANTO II,25
697,CANTO II,
698,CANTO II,"“This forest lies a thousand miles, perhaps,"
699,CANTO II,Beyond where I am come. And farther still
700,CANTO II,"The rivers wander seaward with smooth lapse,"
701,CANTO II,"And there is cliff and cottage, tower and hill."
702,CANTO II,"Somewhere, before the world’s end, I shall fill"
703,CANTO II,My spirit at earth’s pap. For earth must hold
704,CANTO II,One rich thing sealed as Dymer’s from of old.
705,CANTO II,
706,CANTO II,
707,CANTO II,26
708,CANTO II,
709,CANTO II,"“One rich thing--or, it may be, more than this...."
710,CANTO II,Might I not reach the borders of a land
711,CANTO II,"That ought to have been mine? And there, the bliss"
712,CANTO II,"Of free speech, there the eyes that understand,"
713,CANTO II,"The men free grown, not modelled by the hand"
714,CANTO II,"Of masters--men that know, or men that seek,"
715,CANTO II,--They will not gape and murmur when I speak.”
716,CANTO II,
717,CANTO II,
718,CANTO II,27
719,CANTO II,
720,CANTO II,"Then, as he ceased, amid the farther wall"
721,CANTO II,He saw a curtained and low lintelled door;
722,CANTO II,"--Dark curtains, sweepy fold, night-purple pall,"
723,CANTO II,He thought he had not noticed it before.
724,CANTO II,Sudden desire for darkness overbore
725,CANTO II,"His will, and drew him towards it. All was blind"
726,CANTO II,Within. He passed. The curtains closed behind.
727,CANTO II,
728,CANTO II,
729,CANTO II,28
730,CANTO II,
731,CANTO II,He entered in a void. Night-scented flowers
732,CANTO II,"Breathed there, but this was darker than the night"
733,CANTO II,"That is most black with beating thundershowers,"
734,CANTO II,--A disembodied world where depth and height
735,CANTO II,And distance were unmade. No seam of light
736,CANTO II,"Showed through. It was a world not made for seeing,"
737,CANTO II,"One pure, one undivided sense of being."
738,CANTO II,
739,CANTO II,
740,CANTO II,29
741,CANTO II,
742,CANTO II,"Through darkness smooth as amber, warily, slowly"
743,CANTO II,He moved. The floor was soft beneath his feet.
744,CANTO II,"A cool smell that was holy and unholy,"
745,CANTO II,Sharp like the very spring and roughly sweet
746,CANTO II,Blew towards him: and he felt his fingers meet
747,CANTO II,Broad leaves and wiry stems that at his will
748,CANTO II,Unclosed before and closed behind him still.
749,CANTO II,
750,CANTO II,
751,CANTO II,30
752,CANTO II,
753,CANTO II,With body intent he felt the foliage quiver
754,CANTO II,On breast and thighs. With groping arms he made
755,CANTO II,Wide passes in the air. A sacred shiver
756,CANTO II,Of joy from the heart’s centre oddly strayed
757,CANTO II,"To every nerve. Deep sighing, much afraid,"
758,CANTO II,"Much wondering, he went on: then, stooping, found"
759,CANTO II,A knee-depth of warm pillows on the ground.
760,CANTO II,
761,CANTO II,
762,CANTO II,31
763,CANTO II,
764,CANTO II,"And there it was sweet rapture to lie still,"
765,CANTO II,Eyes open on the dark. A flowing health
766,CANTO II,Bathed him from head to foot and great goodwill
767,CANTO II,Rose springing in his heart and poured its wealth
768,CANTO II,Outwards. Then came a hand as if by stealth
769,CANTO II,Out of the dark and touched his hand: and after
770,CANTO II,The beating silence budded into laughter:
771,CANTO II,
772,CANTO II,
773,CANTO II,32
774,CANTO II,
775,CANTO II,"--A low grave laugh and rounded like a pearl,"
776,CANTO II,"Mysterious, filled with home. He opened wide"
777,CANTO II,His arms. The breathing body of a girl
778,CANTO II,"Slid into them. From the world’s end, with the stride"
779,CANTO II,Of seven league boots came passion to his side.
780,CANTO II,"Then, meeting mouths, soft-falling hair, a cry,"
781,CANTO II,"Heart-shaken flank, sudden cool-folded thigh:"
782,CANTO II,
783,CANTO II,
784,CANTO II,33
785,CANTO II,
786,CANTO II,The same night swelled the mushroom in earth’s lap
787,CANTO II,And silvered the wet fields: it drew the bud
788,CANTO II,From hiding and led on the rhythmic sap
789,CANTO II,"And sent the young wolves thirsting after blood,"
790,CANTO II,"And, wheeling the big seas, made ebb and flood"
791,CANTO II,Along the shores of earth: and held these two
792,CANTO II,In dead sleep till the time of morning dew.
793,CANTO II,
794,CANTO II,
795,CANTO II,
796,CANTO II,
797,CANTO III,CANTO III
798,CANTO III,
799,CANTO III,
800,CANTO III,1
801,CANTO III,
802,CANTO III,"He woke, and all at once before his eyes"
803,CANTO III,The pale spires of the chestnut-trees in bloom
804,CANTO III,"Rose waving and, beyond, dove-coloured skies;"
805,CANTO III,"But where he lay was dark and, out of gloom,"
806,CANTO III,"He saw them, through the doorway of a room"
807,CANTO III,"Full of strange scents and softness, padded deep"
808,CANTO III,"With growing leaves, heavy with last night’s sleep."
809,CANTO III,
810,CANTO III,
811,CANTO III,2
812,CANTO III,
813,CANTO III,He rubbed his eyes. He felt that chamber wreathing
814,CANTO III,New sleepiness around him. At his side
815,CANTO III,He was aware of warmth and quiet breathing.
816,CANTO III,"Twice he sank back, loose limbed and drowsy eyed;"
817,CANTO III,But the wind came even there. A sparrow cried
818,CANTO III,"And the wood shone without. Then Dymer rose,"
819,CANTO III,"--“Just for one glance,” he said, and went, tip-toes,"
820,CANTO III,
821,CANTO III,
822,CANTO III,3
823,CANTO III,
824,CANTO III,Out into crisp grey air and drenching grass.
825,CANTO III,The whitened cobweb sparkling in its place
826,CANTO III,Clung to his feet. He saw the wagtail pass
827,CANTO III,Beside him and the thrush: and from his face
828,CANTO III,Felt the thin-scented winds divinely chase
829,CANTO III,"The flush of sleep. Far off he saw, between"
830,CANTO III,"The trees, long morning shadows of dark green."
831,CANTO III,
832,CANTO III,
833,CANTO III,4
834,CANTO III,
835,CANTO III,"He stretched his lazy arms to their full height,"
836,CANTO III,"Yawning, and sighed and laughed, and sighed anew:"
837,CANTO III,"Then wandered farther, watching with delight"
838,CANTO III,"How his broad naked footprints stained the dew,"
839,CANTO III,--Pressing his foot to feel the cold come through
840,CANTO III,Between the spreading toes--then wheeling round
841,CANTO III,"Each moment to some new, shrill forest sound."
842,CANTO III,
843,CANTO III,
844,CANTO III,5
845,CANTO III,
846,CANTO III,The wood with its cold flowers had nothing there
847,CANTO III,"More beautiful than he, new waked from sleep,"
848,CANTO III,New born from joy. His soul lay very bare
849,CANTO III,"That moment to life’s touch, and pondering deep"
850,CANTO III,Now first he knew that no desire could keep
851,CANTO III,"These hours for always, and that men do die"
852,CANTO III,"--But oh, the present glory of lungs and eye!"
853,CANTO III,
854,CANTO III,
855,CANTO III,6
856,CANTO III,
857,CANTO III,He thought: “At home they are waking now. The stair
858,CANTO III,Is filled with feet. The bells clang--far from me.
859,CANTO III,Where am I now? I could not point to where
860,CANTO III,"The City lies from here,” ... then, suddenly,"
861,CANTO III,"“If I were here alone, these woods could be"
862,CANTO III,A frightful place! But now I have met my friend
863,CANTO III,"Who loves me, we can talk to the road’s end.”"
864,CANTO III,
865,CANTO III,
866,CANTO III,7
867,CANTO III,
868,CANTO III,"Thus, quickening with the sweetness of the tale"
869,CANTO III,"Of his new love, he turned. He saw, between"
870,CANTO III,The young leaves where the palace walls showed pale
871,CANTO III,"With chilly stone: but far above the green,"
872,CANTO III,"Springing like cliffs in air, the towers were seen,"
873,CANTO III,Making more quiet yet the quiet dawn.
874,CANTO III,Thither he came. He reached the open lawn.
875,CANTO III,
876,CANTO III,
877,CANTO III,8
878,CANTO III,
879,CANTO III,No bird was moving here. Against the wall
880,CANTO III,Out of the unscythed grass the nettle grew.
881,CANTO III,"The doors stood open wide, but no footfall"
882,CANTO III,Rang in the colonnades. Whispering through
883,CANTO III,Arches and hollow halls the light wind blew....
884,CANTO III,"His awe returned. He whistled--then, no more,"
885,CANTO III,It’s better to plunge in by the first door.
886,CANTO III,
887,CANTO III,
888,CANTO III,9
889,CANTO III,
890,CANTO III,But then the vastness threw him into doubt.
891,CANTO III,Was this the door that he had found last night?
892,CANTO III,"Or that, beneath the tower? Had he come out"
893,CANTO III,This side at all? As the first snow falls light
894,CANTO III,"With following rain before the year grows white,"
895,CANTO III,"So the first, dim foreboding touched his mind,"
896,CANTO III,"Gently as yet, and easily thrust behind."
897,CANTO III,
898,CANTO III,
899,CANTO III,10
900,CANTO III,
901,CANTO III,"And with it came the thought, “I do not know"
902,CANTO III,"Her name--no, nor her face.” But still his mood"
903,CANTO III,Ran blithely as he felt the morning blow
904,CANTO III,"About him, and the earth-smell in the wood"
905,CANTO III,Seemed waking for long hours that must be good
906,CANTO III,"Here, in the unfettered lands, that knew no cause"
907,CANTO III,For grudging--out of reach of the old laws.
908,CANTO III,
909,CANTO III,
910,CANTO III,11
911,CANTO III,
912,CANTO III,"He hastened to one entry. Up the stair,"
913,CANTO III,"Beneath the pillared porch, without delay,"
914,CANTO III,He ran--then halted suddenly: for there
915,CANTO III,"Across the quiet threshold something lay,"
916,CANTO III,"A bundle, a dark mass that barred the way."
917,CANTO III,"He looked again and lo, the formless pile"
918,CANTO III,Under his eyes was moving all the while.
919,CANTO III,
920,CANTO III,
921,CANTO III,12
922,CANTO III,
923,CANTO III,"And it had hands, pale hands of wrinkled flesh,"
924,CANTO III,"Puckered and gnarled with vast antiquity,"
925,CANTO III,"That moved. He eyed the sprawling thing afresh,"
926,CANTO III,And bit by bit (so faces come to be
927,CANTO III,"In the red coal) yet surely, he could see"
928,CANTO III,"That the swathed hugeness was uncleanly human,"
929,CANTO III,"A living thing, the likeness of a woman."
930,CANTO III,
931,CANTO III,
932,CANTO III,13
933,CANTO III,
934,CANTO III,In the centre a draped hummock marked the head;
935,CANTO III,Thence flowed the broader lines with curve and fold
936,CANTO III,Spreading as oak roots do. You would have said
937,CANTO III,A man could hide among them and grow old
938,CANTO III,In finding a way out. Breasts manifold
939,CANTO III,As of the Ephesian Artemis might be
940,CANTO III,Under that robe. The face he did not see.
941,CANTO III,
942,CANTO III,
943,CANTO III,14
944,CANTO III,
945,CANTO III,"And all his being answered, “Not that way!”"
946,CANTO III,Never a word he spoke. Stealthily creeping
947,CANTO III,Back from the door he drew. Quick! No delay!
948,CANTO III,"Quick, quick, but very quiet!--backward peeping"
949,CANTO III,"Till fairly out of sight. Then shouting, leaping,"
950,CANTO III,Shaking himself he ran--as puppies do
951,CANTO III,From bathing--till that door was out of view.
952,CANTO III,
953,CANTO III,
954,CANTO III,15
955,CANTO III,
956,CANTO III,Another gate--and empty. In he went
957,CANTO III,And found a courtyard open to the sky
958,CANTO III,Amidst it dripped a fountain. Heavy scent
959,CANTO III,Of flowers was here; the foxglove standing high
960,CANTO III,Sheltered the whining wasp. With hasty eye
961,CANTO III,He travelled round the walls. One doorway led
962,CANTO III,Within: one showed a further court ahead.
963,CANTO III,
964,CANTO III,
965,CANTO III,16
966,CANTO III,
967,CANTO III,"He ran up to the first--a hungry lover,"
968,CANTO III,"And not yet taught to endure, not blunted yet,"
969,CANTO III,But weary of long waiting to discover
970,CANTO III,That loved one’s face. Before his foot was set
971,CANTO III,"On the first stair, he felt the sudden sweat,"
972,CANTO III,"Cold on his sides. That sprawling mass in view,"
973,CANTO III,That shape--the horror of heaviness--here too.
974,CANTO III,
975,CANTO III,
976,CANTO III,17
977,CANTO III,
978,CANTO III,He fell back from the porch. Not yet--not yet--
979,CANTO III,There must be other ways where he would meet
980,CANTO III,No watcher in the door. He would not let
981,CANTO III,"The fear rise, nor hope falter, nor defeat"
982,CANTO III,Be entered in his thoughts. A sultry heat
983,CANTO III,"Seemed to have filled the day. His breath came short,"
984,CANTO III,And he passed on into that inner court.
985,CANTO III,
986,CANTO III,
987,CANTO III,18
988,CANTO III,
989,CANTO III,And (like a dream) the sight he feared to find
990,CANTO III,"Was waiting here. Then cloister, path and square"
991,CANTO III,"He hastened through: down paths that needed blind,"
992,CANTO III,Traced and retraced his steps. The thing sat there
993,CANTO III,"In every door, still watching, everywhere,"
994,CANTO III,"Behind, ahead, all round--So! Steady now,"
995,CANTO III,Lest panic comes. He stopped. He wiped his brow.
996,CANTO III,
997,CANTO III,
998,CANTO III,19
999,CANTO III,
1000,CANTO III,"But, as he strove to rally, came the thought"
1001,CANTO III,That he had dreamed of such a place before
1002,CANTO III,--Knew how it all would end. He must be caught
1003,CANTO III,Early or late. No good! But all the more
1004,CANTO III,He raged with passionate will that overbore
1005,CANTO III,"That knowledge: and cried out, and beat his head,"
1006,CANTO III,"Raving, upon the senseless walls, and said,"
1007,CANTO III,
1008,CANTO III,
1009,CANTO III,20
1010,CANTO III,
1011,CANTO III,"“Where? Where? Dear, look once out. Give but one sign."
1012,CANTO III,"It’s I, I, Dymer. Are you chained and hidden?"
1013,CANTO III,What have they done to her? Loose her! She is mine.
1014,CANTO III,"Through stone and iron, haunted and hag-ridden,"
1015,CANTO III,"I’ll come to you--no stranger, nor unbidden,"
1016,CANTO III,It’s I. Don’t fear them. Shout above them all.
1017,CANTO III,Can you not hear? I’ll follow at your call.”
1018,CANTO III,
1019,CANTO III,
1020,CANTO III,21
1021,CANTO III,
1022,CANTO III,From every arch the echo of his cry
1023,CANTO III,"Returned. Then all was silent, and he knew"
1024,CANTO III,There was no other way. He must pass by
1025,CANTO III,"That horror: tread her down, force his way through,"
1026,CANTO III,Or die upon the threshold. And this too
1027,CANTO III,Had all been in a dream. He felt his heart
1028,CANTO III,Beating as if his throat would burst apart.
1029,CANTO III,
1030,CANTO III,
1031,CANTO III,22
1032,CANTO III,
1033,CANTO III,There was no other way. He stood a space
1034,CANTO III,"And pondered it. Then, gathering up his will,"
1035,CANTO III,He went to the next door. The pillared place
1036,CANTO III,"Beneath the porch was dark. The air was still,"
1037,CANTO III,Moss on the steps. He felt her presence fill
1038,CANTO III,The threshold with dull life. Here too was she.
1039,CANTO III,This time he raised his eyes and dared to see.
1040,CANTO III,
1041,CANTO III,
1042,CANTO III,23
1043,CANTO III,
1044,CANTO III,"Pah! Only an old woman!... but the size,"
1045,CANTO III,"The old, old matriarchal dreadfulness,"
1046,CANTO III,"Immoveable, intolerable ... the eyes"
1047,CANTO III,"Hidden, the hidden head, the winding dress"
1048,CANTO III,Corpselike.... The weight of the brute that seemed to press
1049,CANTO III,Upon his heart and breathing. Then he heard
1050,CANTO III,"His own voice, strange and humbled, take the word."
1051,CANTO III,
1052,CANTO III,
1053,CANTO III,24
1054,CANTO III,
1055,CANTO III,"“Good Mother, let me pass. I have a friend"
1056,CANTO III,To look for in this house. I slept the night
1057,CANTO III,"And feasted here--it was my journey’s end,"
1058,CANTO III,"--I found it by the music and the light,"
1059,CANTO III,"And no one kept the doors, and I did right"
1060,CANTO III,"To enter--did I not? Now, Mother, pray,"
1061,CANTO III,"Let me pass in ... good Mother, give me way.”"
1062,CANTO III,
1063,CANTO III,
1064,CANTO III,25
1065,CANTO III,
1066,CANTO III,The woman answered nothing: but he saw
1067,CANTO III,"The hands, like crabs, still wandering on her knee."
1068,CANTO III,"“Mother, if I have broken any law,"
1069,CANTO III,"I’ll ask a pardon once: then let it be,"
1070,CANTO III,--Once is enough--and leave the passage free.
1071,CANTO III,I am in haste. And though it were a sin
1072,CANTO III,"By all the laws you have, I must go in.”"
1073,CANTO III,
1074,CANTO III,
1075,CANTO III,26
1076,CANTO III,
1077,CANTO III,"Courage was rising in him now. He said,"
1078,CANTO III,"“Out of my path, old woman. For this cause"
1079,CANTO III,"I am new born, new freed, and here new wed,"
1080,CANTO III,That I might be the breaker of bad laws.
1081,CANTO III,The frost of old forbiddings breaks and thaws
1082,CANTO III,Wherever my feet fall. I bring to birth
1083,CANTO III,"Under its crust the green, ungrudging earth.”"
1084,CANTO III,
1085,CANTO III,
1086,CANTO III,27
1087,CANTO III,
1088,CANTO III,"He had started, bowing low: but now he stood"
1089,CANTO III,Stretched to his height. His own voice in his breast
1090,CANTO III,"Made misery pompous, firing all his blood."
1091,CANTO III,"“Enough,” he cried. “Give place. You shall not wrest"
1092,CANTO III,My love from me. I journey on a quest
1093,CANTO III,"You cannot understand, whose strength shall bear me"
1094,CANTO III,Through fire and earth. A bogy will not scare me.
1095,CANTO III,
1096,CANTO III,
1097,CANTO III,28
1098,CANTO III,
1099,CANTO III,“I am the sword of spring; I am the truth.
1100,CANTO III,"Old night put out your stars, the dawn is here,"
1101,CANTO III,"The sleeper’s wakening, and the wings of youth."
1102,CANTO III,With crumbling veneration and cowed fear
1103,CANTO III,"I make no truce. My loved one, live and dear,"
1104,CANTO III,"Waits for me. Let me in! I fled the City,"
1105,CANTO III,"Shall I fear you or ... Mother, ah, for pity.”"
1106,CANTO III,
1107,CANTO III,
1108,CANTO III,29
1109,CANTO III,
1110,CANTO III,For his high mood fell shattered. Like a man
1111,CANTO III,"Unnerved, in bayonet-fighting, in the thick,"
1112,CANTO III,"--Full of red rum and cheers when he began,"
1113,CANTO III,"Now, in a dream, muttering: “I’ve not the trick."
1114,CANTO III,It’s no good. I’m no good. They’re all too quick.
1115,CANTO III,"There! Look there! Look at that!” So Dymer stood,"
1116,CANTO III,Suddenly drained of hope. It was no good.
1117,CANTO III,
1118,CANTO III,
1119,CANTO III,30
1120,CANTO III,
1121,CANTO III,He pleaded then. Shame beneath shame. “Forgive.
1122,CANTO III,It may be there are powers I cannot break.
1123,CANTO III,"If you are of them, speak. Speak. Let me live."
1124,CANTO III,I ask so small a thing. I beg. I make
1125,CANTO III,My body a living prayer whose force would shake
1126,CANTO III,The mountains. I’ll recant--confess my sin--
1127,CANTO III,But this once let me pass. I must go in.
1128,CANTO III,
1129,CANTO III,
1130,CANTO III,31
1131,CANTO III,
1132,CANTO III,"“Yield but one inch, once only from your law"
1133,CANTO III,"Set any price--I will give all, obey"
1134,CANTO III,"All else but this, hold your least word in awe,"
1135,CANTO III,Give you no cause for anger from this day.
1136,CANTO III,Answer! The least things living when they pray
1137,CANTO III,As I pray now bear witness. They speak true
1138,CANTO III,"Against God. Answer! Mother, let me through.”"
1139,CANTO III,
1140,CANTO III,
1141,CANTO III,32
1142,CANTO III,
1143,CANTO III,"Then when he heard no answer, mad with fear"
1144,CANTO III,"And with desire, too strained with both to know"
1145,CANTO III,"What he desired or feared, yet staggering near,"
1146,CANTO III,He forced himself towards her and bent low
1147,CANTO III,For grappling. Then came darkness. Then a blow
1148,CANTO III,"Fell on his heart, he thought. There came a blank"
1149,CANTO III,"Of all things. As the dead sink, down he sank."
1150,CANTO III,
1151,CANTO III,
1152,CANTO III,33
1153,CANTO III,
1154,CANTO III,"The first big drops are rattling on the trees,"
1155,CANTO III,"The sky is copper dark, low thunder pealing."
1156,CANTO III,See Dymer with drooped head and knocking knees
1157,CANTO III,"Comes from the porch. Then slowly, drunkly reeling,"
1158,CANTO III,"Blind, beaten, broken, past desire of healing,"
1159,CANTO III,"Past knowledge of his misery, he goes on"
1160,CANTO III,Under the first dark trees and now is gone.
1161,CANTO III,
1162,CANTO III,
1163,CANTO III,
1164,CANTO III,
1165,CANTO IV,CANTO IV
1166,CANTO IV,
1167,CANTO IV,
1168,CANTO IV,1
1169,CANTO IV,
1170,CANTO IV,First came the peal that split the heavens apart
1171,CANTO IV,Straight overhead. Then silence. Then the rain;
1172,CANTO IV,"Twelve miles of downward water like one dart,"
1173,CANTO IV,"And in one leap were launched along the plain,"
1174,CANTO IV,"To break the budding flower and flood the grain,"
1175,CANTO IV,And keep with dripping sound an undersong
1176,CANTO IV,Amid the wheeling thunder all night long.
1177,CANTO IV,
1178,CANTO IV,
1179,CANTO IV,2
1180,CANTO IV,
1181,CANTO IV,He put his hands before his face. He stooped
1182,CANTO IV,Blind with his hair. The loud drops’ grim tattoo
1183,CANTO IV,"Beat him to earth. Like summer grass he drooped,"
1184,CANTO IV,"Amazed, while sheeted lightning large and blue"
1185,CANTO IV,Blinked wide and pricked the quivering eyeball through.
1186,CANTO IV,"Then, scrambling to his feet, with downward head"
1187,CANTO IV,He fought into the tempest as chance led.
1188,CANTO IV,
1189,CANTO IV,
1190,CANTO IV,3
1191,CANTO IV,
1192,CANTO IV,The wood was mad. Soughing of branch and straining
1193,CANTO IV,Was there: drumming of water. Light was none
1194,CANTO IV,Nor knowledge of himself. The trees’ complaining
1195,CANTO IV,"And his own throbbing heart seemed mixed in one,"
1196,CANTO IV,One sense of bitter loss and beauty undone;
1197,CANTO IV,All else was blur and chaos and rain-steam
1198,CANTO IV,And noise and the confusion of a dream.
1199,CANTO IV,
1200,CANTO IV,
1201,CANTO IV,4
1202,CANTO IV,
1203,CANTO IV,Aha!... Earth hates a miserable man:
1204,CANTO IV,Against him even the clouds and winds conspire.
1205,CANTO IV,"Heaven’s voice smote Dymer’s ear-drum as he ran,"
1206,CANTO IV,Its red throat plagued the dark with corded fire
1207,CANTO IV,"--Barbed flame, coiled flame that ran like living wire"
1208,CANTO IV,"Charged with disastrous current, left and right"
1209,CANTO IV,"About his path, hell-blue or staring white."
1210,CANTO IV,
1211,CANTO IV,
1212,CANTO IV,5
1213,CANTO IV,
1214,CANTO IV,Stab! Stab! Blast all at once. What’s he to fear?
1215,CANTO IV,Look there--that cedar shrivelling in swift blight
1216,CANTO IV,"Even where he stood! And there--ah, that came near!"
1217,CANTO IV,"Oh, if some shaft would break his soul outright,"
1218,CANTO IV,What ease so to unload and scatter quite
1219,CANTO IV,"On the darkness this wild beating in his skull,"
1220,CANTO IV,"Too burning to endure, too tense and full."
1221,CANTO IV,
1222,CANTO IV,
1223,CANTO IV,6
1224,CANTO IV,
1225,CANTO IV,All lost: and driven away: even her name
1226,CANTO IV,"Unknown. O fool, to have wasted for a kiss"
1227,CANTO IV,Time when they could have talked! An angry shame
1228,CANTO IV,"Was in him. He had worshipt earth, and this"
1229,CANTO IV,"--The venomed clouds fire spitting from the abyss,"
1230,CANTO IV,"This was the truth indeed, the world’s intent"
1231,CANTO IV,"Unmasked and naked now, the thing it meant."
1232,CANTO IV,
1233,CANTO IV,
1234,CANTO IV,7
1235,CANTO IV,
1236,CANTO IV,The storm lay on the forest a great time
1237,CANTO IV,"--Wheeled in its thundery circuit, turned, returned."
1238,CANTO IV,"Still through the dead-leaved darkness, through the slime"
1239,CANTO IV,Of standing pools and slots of clay storm-churned
1240,CANTO IV,Went Dymer. Still the knotty lightning burned
1241,CANTO IV,Along black air. He heard the unbroken sound
1242,CANTO IV,Of water rising in the hollower ground.
1243,CANTO IV,
1244,CANTO IV,
1245,CANTO IV,8
1246,CANTO IV,
1247,CANTO IV,"He cursed it in his madness, flung it back,"
1248,CANTO IV,"Sorrow as wild as young men’s sorrows are,"
1249,CANTO IV,"Till, after midnight, when the tempest’s track"
1250,CANTO IV,"Drew off, between two clouds appeared one star."
1251,CANTO IV,"Then his mood changed. And this was heavier far,"
1252,CANTO IV,"When bit by bit, rarer and still more rare,"
1253,CANTO IV,The weakening thunder ceased from the cleansed air;
1254,CANTO IV,
1255,CANTO IV,
1256,CANTO IV,9
1257,CANTO IV,
1258,CANTO IV,When leaves began to drip with dying rain
1259,CANTO IV,"And trees showed black against the glimmering sky,"
1260,CANTO IV,When the night-birds flapped out and called again
1261,CANTO IV,Above him: when the silence cool and shy
1262,CANTO IV,"Came stealing to its own, and streams ran by"
1263,CANTO IV,Now audible amid the rustling wood
1264,CANTO IV,"--Oh, then came the worst hour for flesh and blood."
1265,CANTO IV,
1266,CANTO IV,
1267,CANTO IV,10
1268,CANTO IV,
1269,CANTO IV,It was no nightmare now with fiery stream
1270,CANTO IV,"Too horrible to last, able to blend"
1271,CANTO IV,Itself and all things in one hurrying dream;
1272,CANTO IV,It was the waking world that will not end
1273,CANTO IV,"Because hearts break, that is not foe nor friend,"
1274,CANTO IV,Where sane and settled knowledge first appears
1275,CANTO IV,"Of workday desolation, with no tears."
1276,CANTO IV,
1277,CANTO IV,
1278,CANTO IV,11
1279,CANTO IV,
1280,CANTO IV,"He halted then, foot-sore, weary to death"
1281,CANTO IV,"And heard his heart beating in solitude,"
1282,CANTO IV,When suddenly the sound of sharpest breath
1283,CANTO IV,Indrawn with pain and the raw smell of blood
1284,CANTO IV,Surprised his sense. Near by to where he stood
1285,CANTO IV,"Came a long whimpering moan--a broken word,"
1286,CANTO IV,A rustle of leaves where some live body stirred.
1287,CANTO IV,
1288,CANTO IV,
1289,CANTO IV,12
1290,CANTO IV,
1291,CANTO IV,"He groped towards the sound. “What, brother, brother,"
1292,CANTO IV,Who groaned?”--“I’m hit. I’m finished. Let me be.”
1293,CANTO IV,"--“Put out your hand, then. Reach me. No, the other.”"
1294,CANTO IV,--“Don’t touch. Fool! Damn you. Leave me.”--“I can’t see.
1295,CANTO IV,Where are you?” Then more groans. “They’ve done for me.
1296,CANTO IV,"I’ve no hands. Don’t come near me. No, but stay,"
1297,CANTO IV,Don’t leave me ... oh my God! Is it near day?”
1298,CANTO IV,
1299,CANTO IV,
1300,CANTO IV,13
1301,CANTO IV,
1302,CANTO IV,"--“Soon now, a little longer. Can you sleep?"
1303,CANTO IV,"I’ll watch for you.”--“Sleep, is it? That’s ahead,"
1304,CANTO IV,"But none till then. Listen, I’ve bled too deep"
1305,CANTO IV,To last out till the morning. I’ll be dead
1306,CANTO IV,Within the hour--sleep then. I’ve heard it said
1307,CANTO IV,"They don’t mind at the last, but this is Hell."
1308,CANTO IV,If I’d the strength--I have such things to tell.”
1309,CANTO IV,
1310,CANTO IV,
1311,CANTO IV,14
1312,CANTO IV,
1313,CANTO IV,All trembling in the dark and sweated over
1314,CANTO IV,"Like a man reared in peace, unused to pain,"
1315,CANTO IV,"Sat Dymer near him in the lightless cover,"
1316,CANTO IV,Afraid to touch and shamefaced to refrain.
1317,CANTO IV,Then bit by bit and often checked again
1318,CANTO IV,With agony the voice told on. (The place
1319,CANTO IV,"Was dark, that neither saw the other’s face.)"
1320,CANTO IV,
1321,CANTO IV,
1322,CANTO IV,15
1323,CANTO IV,
1324,CANTO IV,“There is a City which men call in scorn
1325,CANTO IV,The Perfect City--eastward of this wood--
1326,CANTO IV,You’ve heard about the place. There I was born.
1327,CANTO IV,"I’m one of them, their work. Their sober mood,"
1328,CANTO IV,"The ordered life, the laws, are in my blood"
1329,CANTO IV,"--A life ... well, less than happy, something more"
1330,CANTO IV,Than the red greed and lusts that went before.
1331,CANTO IV,
1332,CANTO IV,
1333,CANTO IV,16
1334,CANTO IV,
1335,CANTO IV,“All in one day one man and at one blow
1336,CANTO IV,Brought ruin on us all. There was a boy
1337,CANTO IV,"--Blue eyes, large limbs, were all he had to show,"
1338,CANTO IV,You need no greater prophets to destroy.
1339,CANTO IV,He seemed a man asleep. Sorrow and joy
1340,CANTO IV,"Had passed him by--the dreamiest, safest man,"
1341,CANTO IV,"The most obscure, until this curse began."
1342,CANTO IV,
1343,CANTO IV,
1344,CANTO IV,17
1345,CANTO IV,
1346,CANTO IV,"“Then--how or why it was, I cannot say,"
1347,CANTO IV,"This Dymer, this fool baby pink-and-white,"
1348,CANTO IV,"Went mad beneath his quiet face. One day,"
1349,CANTO IV,"With nothing said, he rose and laughed outright"
1350,CANTO IV,"Before his master: then, in all our sight,"
1351,CANTO IV,"Even where we sat to watch, he struck him dead"
1352,CANTO IV,And screamed with laughter once again and fled.
1353,CANTO IV,
1354,CANTO IV,
1355,CANTO IV,18
1356,CANTO IV,
1357,CANTO IV,"“Lord! how it all comes back. How still the place is,"
1358,CANTO IV,And he there lying dead ... only the sound
1359,CANTO IV,Of a bluebottle buzzing ... sharpened faces
1360,CANTO IV,"Strained, gaping from the benches all around..."
1361,CANTO IV,"The dead man hunched and quiet with no wound,"
1362,CANTO IV,And minute after minute terror creeping
1363,CANTO IV,With dreadful hopes to set the wild heart leaping.
1364,CANTO IV,
1365,CANTO IV,
1366,CANTO IV,19
1367,CANTO IV,
1368,CANTO IV,"“Then one by one at random (no word spoken),"
1369,CANTO IV,We slipt out to the sunlight and away.
1370,CANTO IV,We felt the empty sense of something broken
1371,CANTO IV,And comfortless adventure all that day.
1372,CANTO IV,Men loitered at their work and could not say
1373,CANTO IV,What trembled at their lips or what new light
1374,CANTO IV,Was in girls’ eyes. Yet we endured till night.
1375,CANTO IV,
1376,CANTO IV,
1377,CANTO IV,20
1378,CANTO IV,
1379,CANTO IV,"“Then ... I was lying wide awake in bed,"
1380,CANTO IV,"Shot through with tremulous thought, lame hopes, and sweet"
1381,CANTO IV,Desire of reckless days--with burning head.
1382,CANTO IV,"And then there came a clamour from the street,"
1383,CANTO IV,"Came nearer, nearer, nearer--stamping feet"
1384,CANTO IV,And screaming song and curses and a shout
1385,CANTO IV,"Of ‘Who’s for Dymer, Dymer?--Up and out!’"
1386,CANTO IV,
1387,CANTO IV,
1388,CANTO IV,21
1389,CANTO IV,
1390,CANTO IV,“We looked out from our window. Thronging there
1391,CANTO IV,"A thousand of our people, girls and men,"
1392,CANTO IV,Raved and reviled and shouted by the glare
1393,CANTO IV,Of torches and of bonfire blaze. And then
1394,CANTO IV,Came tumult from the street beyond: again
1395,CANTO IV,‘Dymer’ they cried. And farther off there came
1396,CANTO IV,The sound of gun-fire and the gleam of flame.
1397,CANTO IV,
1398,CANTO IV,
1399,CANTO IV,22
1400,CANTO IV,
1401,CANTO IV,"“I rushed down with the rest. Oh, we were mad!"
1402,CANTO IV,"After this, it’s all nightmare. The black sky"
1403,CANTO IV,Between the housetops framed was all we had
1404,CANTO IV,To tell us that the old world could not die
1405,CANTO IV,And that we were no gods. The flood ran high
1406,CANTO IV,"When first I came, but after was the worse,"
1407,CANTO IV,"Oh, to recall...! On Dymer rest the curse!"
1408,CANTO IV,
1409,CANTO IV,
1410,CANTO IV,23
1411,CANTO IV,
1412,CANTO IV,“Our leader was a hunchback with red hair
1413,CANTO IV,--Bran was his name. He had that kind of force
1414,CANTO IV,About him that will hold your eyes fast there
1415,CANTO IV,As in ten miles of green one patch of gorse
1416,CANTO IV,Will hold them--do you know? His lips were coarse
1417,CANTO IV,But his eyes like a prophet’s--seemed to fill
1418,CANTO IV,The whole face. And his tongue was never still.
1419,CANTO IV,
1420,CANTO IV,
1421,CANTO IV,24
1422,CANTO IV,
1423,CANTO IV,"“He cried: ‘As Dymer broke, we’ll break the chain."
1424,CANTO IV,The world is free. They taught you to be chaste
1425,CANTO IV,And labour and bear orders and refrain.
1426,CANTO IV,Refrain? From what? All’s good enough. We’ll taste
1427,CANTO IV,Whatever is. Life murmurs from the waste
1428,CANTO IV,Beneath the mind ... who made the reasoning part
1429,CANTO IV,The jailer of the wild gods in the heart?’
1430,CANTO IV,
1431,CANTO IV,
1432,CANTO IV,25
1433,CANTO IV,
1434,CANTO IV,"“We were a ragtail crew--wild-haired, half dressed,"
1435,CANTO IV,"All shouting, ‘Up, for Dymer! Up away!’"
1436,CANTO IV,Yet each one always watching all the rest
1437,CANTO IV,And looking to his back. And some were gay
1438,CANTO IV,"Like drunk men, some were cringing, pinched and grey"
1439,CANTO IV,With terror dry on the lip. (The older ones
1440,CANTO IV,Had had the sense enough to bring their guns.)
1441,CANTO IV,
1442,CANTO IV,
1443,CANTO IV,26
1444,CANTO IV,
1445,CANTO IV,"“The wave where I was swallowed swelled and broke,"
1446,CANTO IV,"After long surge, into the open square."
1447,CANTO IV,And here there was more light: new clamour woke.
1448,CANTO IV,Here first I heard the bullets sting the air
1449,CANTO IV,And went hot round the heart. Our lords were there
1450,CANTO IV,In barricade with all their loyal men.
1451,CANTO IV,For every one man loyal Bran led ten.
1452,CANTO IV,
1453,CANTO IV,
1454,CANTO IV,27
1455,CANTO IV,
1456,CANTO IV,"“Then charge and cheer and bubbling sobs of death,"
1457,CANTO IV,We hovered on their front. Like swarming bees
1458,CANTO IV,Their spraying bullets came--no time for breath.
1459,CANTO IV,I saw men’s stomachs fall out on their knees;
1460,CANTO IV,"And shouting faces, while they shouted, freeze"
1461,CANTO IV,"Into black, bony masks. Before we knew"
1462,CANTO IV,"We’re into them.... ‘Swine!’--‘Die, then’--‘That’s for you.’"
1463,CANTO IV,
1464,CANTO IV,
1465,CANTO IV,28
1466,CANTO IV,
1467,CANTO IV,“The next that I remember was a lull
1468,CANTO IV,"And sated pause. I saw an old, old man"
1469,CANTO IV,Lying before my feet with shattered skull
1470,CANTO IV,And both my arms dripped red. And then came Bran
1471,CANTO IV,"And at his heels a hundred murderers ran,"
1472,CANTO IV,"With prisoners now, clamouring to take and try them"
1473,CANTO IV,"And burn them, wedge their nails up, crucify them."
1474,CANTO IV,
1475,CANTO IV,
1476,CANTO IV,29
1477,CANTO IV,
1478,CANTO IV,“God!... Once the lying spirit of a cause
1479,CANTO IV,"With maddening words dethrones the mind of men,"
1480,CANTO IV,They’re past the reach of prayer. The eternal laws
1481,CANTO IV,"Hate them. Their eyes will not come clean again,"
1482,CANTO IV,But doom and strong delusion drive them then
1483,CANTO IV,"Without ruth, without rest ... the iron laughter"
1484,CANTO IV,Of the immortal mouths goes hooting after.
1485,CANTO IV,
1486,CANTO IV,
1487,CANTO IV,30
1488,CANTO IV,
1489,CANTO IV,“And we had firebrands too. Tower after tower
1490,CANTO IV,Fell sheathed in thundering flame. The street was like
1491,CANTO IV,A furnace mouth. We had them in our power!
1492,CANTO IV,"Then was the time to mock them and to strike,"
1493,CANTO IV,"To flay men and spit women on the pike,"
1494,CANTO IV,Bidding them dance. Wherever the most shame
1495,CANTO IV,Was done the doer called on Dymer’s name.
1496,CANTO IV,
1497,CANTO IV,
1498,CANTO IV,31
1499,CANTO IV,
1500,CANTO IV,“Faces of men in torture ... from my mind
1501,CANTO IV,They will not go away. The East lay still
1502,CANTO IV,In darkness when we left the town behind
1503,CANTO IV,Flaming to light the fields. We’d had our will:
1504,CANTO IV,"We sang, ‘Oh, we will make the frost distil"
1505,CANTO IV,From Time’s grey forehead into living dew
1506,CANTO IV,And break whatever has been and build new.’
1507,CANTO IV,
1508,CANTO IV,
1509,CANTO IV,32
1510,CANTO IV,
1511,CANTO IV,"“Day found us on the border of this wood,"
1512,CANTO IV,Blear-eyed and pale. Then the most part began
1513,CANTO IV,"To murmur and to lag, crying for food"
1514,CANTO IV,And shelter. But we dared not answer Bran.
1515,CANTO IV,Wherever in the ranks the murmur ran
1516,CANTO IV,"He’d find it--‘You, there, whispering. Up, you sneak,"
1517,CANTO IV,"Reactionary, eh? Come out and speak.’"
1518,CANTO IV,
1519,CANTO IV,
1520,CANTO IV,33
1521,CANTO IV,
1522,CANTO IV,"“Then there’d be shrieks, a pistol shot, a cry,"
1523,CANTO IV,And someone down. I was the third he caught.
1524,CANTO IV,"The others pushed me out beneath his eye,"
1525,CANTO IV,"Saying, ‘He’s here; here, Captain.’ Who’d have thought,"
1526,CANTO IV,My old friends? But I know now. I’ve been taught ...
1527,CANTO IV,They cut away my two hands and my feet
1528,CANTO IV,And laughed and left me for the birds to eat.
1529,CANTO IV,
1530,CANTO IV,
1531,CANTO IV,34
1532,CANTO IV,
1533,CANTO IV,"“Oh, God’s name! If I had my hands again"
1534,CANTO IV,And Dymer here ... it would not be my blood
1535,CANTO IV,"I am stronger now than he is, old with pain,"
1536,CANTO IV,"One grip would make him mine. But it’s no good,"
1537,CANTO IV,"I’m dying fast. Look, Stranger, where the wood"
1538,CANTO IV,"Grows lighter. It’s the morning. Stranger dear,"
1539,CANTO IV,Don’t leave me. Talk a little while. Come near.”
1540,CANTO IV,
1541,CANTO IV,
1542,CANTO IV,35
1543,CANTO IV,
1544,CANTO IV,"But Dymer, sitting hunched with knee to chin,"
1545,CANTO IV,"Close to the dying man, answered no word."
1546,CANTO IV,His face was stone. There was no meaning in
1547,CANTO IV,His wakeful eyes. Sometimes the other stirred
1548,CANTO IV,"And fretted, near his death; and Dymer heard,"
1549,CANTO IV,Yet sat like one that neither hears nor sees.
1550,CANTO IV,And the cold east whitened beyond the trees.
1551,CANTO IV,
1552,CANTO IV,
1553,CANTO IV,
1554,CANTO IV,
1555,CANTO V,CANTO V
1556,CANTO V,
1557,CANTO V,
1558,CANTO V,1
1559,CANTO V,
1560,CANTO V,Through bearded cliffs a valley has driven thus deep
1561,CANTO V,Its wedge into the mountain and no more.
1562,CANTO V,The faint track of the farthest-wandering sheep
1563,CANTO V,"Ends here, and the grey hollows at their core"
1564,CANTO V,Of silence feel the dulled continuous roar
1565,CANTO V,Of higher streams. At every step the skies
1566,CANTO V,Grow less and in their place black ridges rise.
1567,CANTO V,
1568,CANTO V,
1569,CANTO V,2
1570,CANTO V,
1571,CANTO V,"Hither, long after noon, with plodding tread"
1572,CANTO V,"And eyes on earth, grown dogged, Dymer came,"
1573,CANTO V,Who all the long day in the woods had fled
1574,CANTO V,From the horror of those lips that screamed his name
1575,CANTO V,And cursed him. Busy wonder and keen shame
1576,CANTO V,"Were driving him, and little thoughts like bees"
1577,CANTO V,Followed and pricked him on and left no ease.
1578,CANTO V,
1579,CANTO V,
1580,CANTO V,3
1581,CANTO V,
1582,CANTO V,"Now, when he looked and saw this emptiness"
1583,CANTO V,"Seven times enfolded in the idle hills,"
1584,CANTO V,"There came a chilly pause to his distress,"
1585,CANTO V,A cloud of the deep world despair that fills
1586,CANTO V,A man’s heart like the incoming tide and kills
1587,CANTO V,All pains except its own. In that broad sea
1588,CANTO V,"No hope, no change, and no regret can be."
1589,CANTO V,
1590,CANTO V,
1591,CANTO V,4
1592,CANTO V,
1593,CANTO V,"He felt the eternal strength of the silly earth,"
1594,CANTO V,"The unhastening circuit of the stars and sea,"
1595,CANTO V,"The business of perpetual death and birth,"
1596,CANTO V,The meaningless precision. All must be
1597,CANTO V,The same and still the same in each degree--
1598,CANTO V,"Who cared now? And he smiled and could forgive,"
1599,CANTO V,Believing that for sure he would not live.
1600,CANTO V,
1601,CANTO V,
1602,CANTO V,5
1603,CANTO V,
1604,CANTO V,"Then, where he saw a little water run"
1605,CANTO V,"Beneath a bush, he slept. The chills of May"
1606,CANTO V,Came dropping and the stars peered one by one
1607,CANTO V,"Out of the deepening blue, while far away"
1608,CANTO V,The western brightness dulled to bars of grey.
1609,CANTO V,"Half-way to midnight, suddenly, from dreaming"
1610,CANTO V,"He woke wide into present horror, screaming."
1611,CANTO V,
1612,CANTO V,
1613,CANTO V,6
1614,CANTO V,
1615,CANTO V,For he had dreamt of being in the arms
1616,CANTO V,Of his beloved and in quiet places;
1617,CANTO V,But all at once it filled with night alarms
1618,CANTO V,"And rapping guns: and men with splintered faces,"
1619,CANTO V,"--No eyes, no nose, all red--were running races"
1620,CANTO V,With worms along the floor. And he ran out
1621,CANTO V,To find the girl and shouted: and that shout
1622,CANTO V,
1623,CANTO V,
1624,CANTO V,7
1625,CANTO V,
1626,CANTO V,Had carried him into the waking world.
1627,CANTO V,"There stood the concave, vast, unfriendly night,"
1628,CANTO V,And over him the scroll of stars unfurled.
1629,CANTO V,Then wailing like a child he rose upright
1630,CANTO V,Heart-sick with desolation. The new blight
1631,CANTO V,"Of loss had nipt him sore, and sad self-pity"
1632,CANTO V,Thinking of her--then thinking of the City.
1633,CANTO V,
1634,CANTO V,
1635,CANTO V,8
1636,CANTO V,
1637,CANTO V,"For, in each moment’s thought, the deeds of Bran,"
1638,CANTO V,"The burning and the blood and his own shame,"
1639,CANTO V,Would tease him into madness till he ran
1640,CANTO V,For refuge to the thought of her; whence came
1641,CANTO V,"Utter and endless loss--no, not a name,"
1642,CANTO V,"Not a word, nothing left--himself alone"
1643,CANTO V,"Crying amid that valley of old stone,"
1644,CANTO V,
1645,CANTO V,
1646,CANTO V,9
1647,CANTO V,
1648,CANTO V,“How soon it all ran out! And I suppose
1649,CANTO V,"They, they up there, the old contriving powers,"
1650,CANTO V,They knew it all the time--for someone knows
1651,CANTO V,"And waits and watches till we pluck the flowers,"
1652,CANTO V,Then leaps. So soon--my store of happy hours
1653,CANTO V,All gone before I knew. I have expended
1654,CANTO V,"My whole wealth in a day. It’s finished, ended."
1655,CANTO V,
1656,CANTO V,
1657,CANTO V,10
1658,CANTO V,
1659,CANTO V,“And nothing left. Can it be possible
1660,CANTO V,"That joy flows through and, when the course is run,"
1661,CANTO V,"It leaves no change, no mark on us to tell"
1662,CANTO V,Its passing? And as poor as we’ve begun
1663,CANTO V,"We end the richest day? What we have won,"
1664,CANTO V,Can it all die like this?... Joy flickers on
1665,CANTO V,The razor-edge of the present and is gone.
1666,CANTO V,
1667,CANTO V,
1668,CANTO V,11
1669,CANTO V,
1670,CANTO V,“What have I done to bear upon my name
1671,CANTO V,"The curse of Bran? I was not of his crew,"
1672,CANTO V,Nor any man’s. And Dymer has the blame--
1673,CANTO V,What have I done? Wronged whom? I never knew.
1674,CANTO V,What’s Bran to me? I had my deed to do
1675,CANTO V,"And ran out by myself, alone and free."
1676,CANTO V,--Why should earth sing with joy and not for me?
1677,CANTO V,
1678,CANTO V,
1679,CANTO V,12
1680,CANTO V,
1681,CANTO V,"“Ah, but the earth never did sing for joy...."
1682,CANTO V,There is a glamour on the leaf and flower
1683,CANTO V,And April comes and whistles to a boy
1684,CANTO V,"Over white fields: and, beauty has such power"
1685,CANTO V,"Upon us, he believes her in that hour,"
1686,CANTO V,"For who could not believe? Can it be false,"
1687,CANTO V,All that the blackbird says and the wind calls?
1688,CANTO V,
1689,CANTO V,
1690,CANTO V,13
1691,CANTO V,
1692,CANTO V,“What have I done? No living thing I made
1693,CANTO V,Nor wished to suffer harm. I sought my good
1694,CANTO V,Because the spring was gloriously arrayed
1695,CANTO V,And the blue eyebright misted all the wood.
1696,CANTO V,"Yet to obey that springtime and my blood,"
1697,CANTO V,This was to be unarmed and off my guard
1698,CANTO V,And gave God time to hit once and hit hard.
1699,CANTO V,
1700,CANTO V,
1701,CANTO V,14
1702,CANTO V,
1703,CANTO V,"“The men build right who made that City of ours,"
1704,CANTO V,They knew their world. A man must crouch to face
1705,CANTO V,"Infinite malice, watching at all hours,"
1706,CANTO V,Shut nature out--give her no moment’s space
1707,CANTO V,For entry. The first needs of all our race
1708,CANTO V,"Are walls, a den, a cover. Traitor I"
1709,CANTO V,Who first ran out beneath the open sky.
1710,CANTO V,
1711,CANTO V,
1712,CANTO V,15
1713,CANTO V,
1714,CANTO V,"“Our fortress and fenced place I made to fall,"
1715,CANTO V,I slipt the sentries and let in the foe.
1716,CANTO V,I have lost my brothers and my love and all.
1717,CANTO V,Nothing is left but me. Now let me go.
1718,CANTO V,I have seen the world stripped naked and I know.
1719,CANTO V,"Great God, take back your world. I will have none"
1720,CANTO V,Of all your glittering gauds but death alone.”
1721,CANTO V,
1722,CANTO V,
1723,CANTO V,16
1724,CANTO V,
1725,CANTO V,Meanwhile the earth swung round in hollow night.
1726,CANTO V,"Souls without number in all nations slept,"
1727,CANTO V,"Snug on her back, safe speeding towards the light,"
1728,CANTO V,"Hours tolled, and in damp woods the night beast crept,"
1729,CANTO V,And over the long seas the watch was kept
1730,CANTO V,"In black ships, twinkling onward, green and red:"
1731,CANTO V,Always the ordered stars moved overhead.
1732,CANTO V,
1733,CANTO V,
1734,CANTO V,17
1735,CANTO V,
1736,CANTO V,And no one knew that Dymer in his scales
1737,CANTO V,Had weighed all these and found them nothing worth.
1738,CANTO V,Indifferently the dawn that never fails
1739,CANTO V,"Troubled the east of night with gradual birth,"
1740,CANTO V,"Whispering a change of colours on cold earth,"
1741,CANTO V,"And a bird woke, then two. The sunlight ran"
1742,CANTO V,Along the hills and yellow day began.
1743,CANTO V,
1744,CANTO V,
1745,CANTO V,18
1746,CANTO V,
1747,CANTO V,But stagnant gloom clung in the valley yet;
1748,CANTO V,"Hills crowded out a third part of the sky,"
1749,CANTO V,"Black-looking, and the boulders dripped with wet:"
1750,CANTO V,"No bird sang. Dymer, shivering, heaved a sigh"
1751,CANTO V,And yawned and said: “It’s cruel work to die
1752,CANTO V,"Of hunger”; and again, with cloudy breath"
1753,CANTO V,"Blown between chattering teeth, “It’s a bad death.”"
1754,CANTO V,
1755,CANTO V,
1756,CANTO V,19
1757,CANTO V,
1758,CANTO V,He crouched and clasped his hands about his knees
1759,CANTO V,And hugged his own limbs for the pitiful sense
1760,CANTO V,"Of homeliness they had--familiars these,"
1761,CANTO V,"This body, at least, his own, his last defence."
1762,CANTO V,"But soon his morning misery drove him thence,"
1763,CANTO V,"Eating his heart, to wander as chance led"
1764,CANTO V,"On, upward, to the narrowing gulley’s head."
1765,CANTO V,
1766,CANTO V,
1767,CANTO V,20
1768,CANTO V,
1769,CANTO V,The cloud lay on the nearest mountain-top
1770,CANTO V,"As from a giant’s chimney smoking there,"
1771,CANTO V,"But Dymer took no heed. Sometimes he’d stop,"
1772,CANTO V,"Sometimes he hurried faster, as despair"
1773,CANTO V,"Pricked deeper, and cried out: “Even now, somewhere,"
1774,CANTO V,"Bran with his crew’s at work. They rack, they burn,"
1775,CANTO V,And there’s no help in me. I’ve served their turn.”
1776,CANTO V,
1777,CANTO V,
1778,CANTO V,21
1779,CANTO V,
1780,CANTO V,"Meanwhile the furrowed fog rolled down ahead,"
1781,CANTO V,Long tatters of its vanguard smearing round
1782,CANTO V,The bases of the crags. Like cobweb shed
1783,CANTO V,Down the deep combes it dulled the tinkling sound
1784,CANTO V,Of water on the hills. The spongy ground
1785,CANTO V,Faded three yards ahead: then nearer yet
1786,CANTO V,"Fell the cold wreathes, the white depth gleaming wet."
1787,CANTO V,
1788,CANTO V,
1789,CANTO V,22
1790,CANTO V,
1791,CANTO V,Then after a long time the path he trod
1792,CANTO V,Led downward. Then all suddenly it dipped
1793,CANTO V,"Far steeper, and yet steeper, with smooth sod."
1794,CANTO V,He was half running now. A stone that slipped
1795,CANTO V,"Beneath him, rattled headlong down: he tripped,"
1796,CANTO V,"Stumbled and clutched--then panic, and no hope"
1797,CANTO V,"To stop himself, once lost upon that slope."
1798,CANTO V,
1799,CANTO V,
1800,CANTO V,23
1801,CANTO V,
1802,CANTO V,"And faster, ever faster, and his eye"
1803,CANTO V,Caught tree-tops far below. The nightmare feeling
1804,CANTO V,Had gripped him. He was screaming: and the sky
1805,CANTO V,"Seemed hanging upside down. Then struggling, reeling,"
1806,CANTO V,"With effort beyond thought he hung half kneeling,"
1807,CANTO V,Halted one saving moment With wild will
1808,CANTO V,"He clawed into the hillside and lay still,"
1809,CANTO V,
1810,CANTO V,
1811,CANTO V,24
1812,CANTO V,
1813,CANTO V,Half hanging on both arms. His idle feet
1814,CANTO V,Dangled and found no hold. The moor lay wet
1815,CANTO V,Against him and he sweated with the heat
1816,CANTO V,"Of terror, all alive. His teeth were set."
1817,CANTO V,"“By God, I will not die,” said he. “Not yet.”"
1818,CANTO V,"Then slowly, slowly, with enormous strain,"
1819,CANTO V,"He heaved himself an inch: then heaved again,"
1820,CANTO V,
1821,CANTO V,
1822,CANTO V,25
1823,CANTO V,
1824,CANTO V,Till saved and spent he lay. He felt indeed
1825,CANTO V,"It was the big, round world beneath his breast,"
1826,CANTO V,The mother planet proven at his need.
1827,CANTO V,"The shame of glad surrender stood confessed,"
1828,CANTO V,"He cared not for his boasts. This, this was best,"
1829,CANTO V,This giving up of all. He need not strive;
1830,CANTO V,"He panted, he lay still, he was alive."
1831,CANTO V,
1832,CANTO V,
1833,CANTO V,26
1834,CANTO V,
1835,CANTO V,And now his eyes were closed. Perhaps he slept
1836,CANTO V,Lapt in unearthly quiet--never knew
1837,CANTO V,How bit by bit the fog’s white rearguard crept
1838,CANTO V,"Over the crest and faded, and the blue"
1839,CANTO V,First brightening at the zenith trembled through
1840,CANTO V,And deepening shadows took a sharper form
1841,CANTO V,"Each moment, and the sandy earth grew warm."
1842,CANTO V,
1843,CANTO V,
1844,CANTO V,27
1845,CANTO V,
1846,CANTO V,"Yet, dreaming of blue skies, in dream he heard"
1847,CANTO V,The pure voice of a lark that seemed to send
1848,CANTO V,Its song from heights beyond all height That bird
1849,CANTO V,"Sang out of heaven, “The world will never end,”"
1850,CANTO V,"Sang from the gates of heaven, “Will never end,”"
1851,CANTO V,Sang till it seemed there was no other thing
1852,CANTO V,But bright space and one voice set there to sing.
1853,CANTO V,
1854,CANTO V,
1855,CANTO V,28
1856,CANTO V,
1857,CANTO V,It seemed to be the murmur and the voice
1858,CANTO V,"Of beings beyond number, each and all"
1859,CANTO V,Singing I am. Each of itself made choice
1860,CANTO V,And was: whence flows the justice that men call
1861,CANTO V,Divine. She keeps the great worlds lest they fall
1862,CANTO V,"From hour to hour, and makes the hills renew"
1863,CANTO V,Their ancient youth and sweetens all things through.
1864,CANTO V,
1865,CANTO V,
1866,CANTO V,29
1867,CANTO V,
1868,CANTO V,It seemed to be the low voice of the world
1869,CANTO V,"Brooding alone beneath the strength of things,"
1870,CANTO V,Murmuring of days and nights and years unfurled
1871,CANTO V,"Forever, and the unwearied joy that brings"
1872,CANTO V,"Out of old fields the flowers of unborn springs,"
1873,CANTO V,"Out of old wars and cities burned with wrong,"
1874,CANTO V,"A splendour in the dark, a tale, a song."
1875,CANTO V,
1876,CANTO V,
1877,CANTO V,30
1878,CANTO V,
1879,CANTO V,"The dream ran thin towards waking, and he knew"
1880,CANTO V,It was a bird’s piping with no sense.
1881,CANTO V,"He rolled round on his back. The sudden blue,"
1882,CANTO V,"Quivering with light, hard, cloudless and intense,"
1883,CANTO V,Shone over him. The lark still sounded thence
1884,CANTO V,And stirred him at the heart Some spacious thought
1885,CANTO V,Was passing by too gently to be caught.
1886,CANTO V,
1887,CANTO V,
1888,CANTO V,31
1889,CANTO V,
1890,CANTO V,With that he thrust the damp hair from his face
1891,CANTO V,And sat upright. The perilous cliff dropped sheer
1892,CANTO V,"Before him, close at hand, and from his place"
1893,CANTO V,Listening in mountain silence he could hear
1894,CANTO V,Birds crying far below. It was not fear
1895,CANTO V,"That took him, but strange glory, when his eye"
1896,CANTO V,Looked past the edge into surrounding sky.
1897,CANTO V,
1898,CANTO V,
1899,CANTO V,32
1900,CANTO V,
1901,CANTO V,He rose and stood. Then lo! the world beneath
1902,CANTO V,"--Wide pools that in the sun-splashed foot hills lay,"
1903,CANTO V,"Sheep-dotted downs, soft-piled, and rolling heath,"
1904,CANTO V,River and shining weir and steeples grey
1905,CANTO V,And the green waves of forest Far away
1906,CANTO V,"Distance rose heaped on distance: nearer hand,"
1907,CANTO V,The white roads leading down to a new land.
1908,CANTO V,
1909,CANTO V,
1910,CANTO V,
1911,CANTO V,
1912,CANTO VI,CANTO VI
1913,CANTO VI,
1914,CANTO VI,
1915,CANTO VI,1
1916,CANTO VI,
1917,CANTO VI,The sun was high in heaven and Dymer stood
1918,CANTO VI,A bright speck on the endless mountain-side.
1919,CANTO VI,"Till, blossom after blossom, that rich mood"
1920,CANTO VI,"Faded and truth rolled homeward, like a tide"
1921,CANTO VI,Before whose edge the weak soul fled to hide
1922,CANTO VI,"In vain, with ostrich head, through many a shape"
1923,CANTO VI,"Of coward fancy, whimpering for escape."
1924,CANTO VI,
1925,CANTO VI,
1926,CANTO VI,2
1927,CANTO VI,
1928,CANTO VI,But only for a moment; then his soul
1929,CANTO VI,Took the full swell and heaved a dripping prow
1930,CANTO VI,Clear of the shattering wave-crest. He was whole.
1931,CANTO VI,"No veils should hide the truth, no truth should cow"
1932,CANTO VI,The dear self-pitying heart “I’ll babble now
1933,CANTO VI,"No longer,” Dymer said. “I’m broken in."
1934,CANTO VI,Pack up the dreams and let the life begin.”
1935,CANTO VI,
1936,CANTO VI,
1937,CANTO VI,3
1938,CANTO VI,
1939,CANTO VI,"With this he turned. “I must have food to-day,”"
1940,CANTO VI,He muttered. Then among the cloudless hills
1941,CANTO VI,By winding tracks he sought the downward way
1942,CANTO VI,And followed the steep course of tumbling rills
1943,CANTO VI,--Came to the glens the wakening mountain fills
1944,CANTO VI,In springtime with the echoing splash and shock
1945,CANTO VI,Of waters leaping cold from rock to rock.
1946,CANTO VI,
1947,CANTO VI,
1948,CANTO VI,4
1949,CANTO VI,
1950,CANTO VI,"And still, it seemed, that lark with its refrain"
1951,CANTO VI,Sang in the sky and wind was in his hair
1952,CANTO VI,"And hope at heart. Then once, and once again,"
1953,CANTO VI,He heard a gun fired off. It broke the air
1954,CANTO VI,"As a stone breaks a pond, and everywhere"
1955,CANTO VI,The dry crags echoed clear: and at the sound
1956,CANTO VI,Once a big bird rose whirring from the ground.
1957,CANTO VI,
1958,CANTO VI,
1959,CANTO VI,5
1960,CANTO VI,
1961,CANTO VI,In half an hour he reached the level land
1962,CANTO VI,"And followed the field-paths and crossed the stiles,"
1963,CANTO VI,"Then looked and saw, near by, on his left hand"
1964,CANTO VI,"An old house, folded round with billowy piles"
1965,CANTO VI,"Of dark yew hedge. The moss was on the tiles,"
1966,CANTO VI,"The pigeons in the yard, and in the tower"
1967,CANTO VI,A clock that had no hands and told no hour.
1968,CANTO VI,
1969,CANTO VI,
1970,CANTO VI,6
1971,CANTO VI,
1972,CANTO VI,He hastened. In warm waves the garden scent
1973,CANTO VI,Came stronger at each stride. The mountain breeze
1974,CANTO VI,Was gone. He reached the gates; then in he went
1975,CANTO VI,And seemed to lose the sky--such weight of trees
1976,CANTO VI,Hung overhead. He heard the noise of bees
1977,CANTO VI,"And saw, far off, in the blue shade between"
1978,CANTO VI,"The windless elms, one walking on the green."
1979,CANTO VI,
1980,CANTO VI,
1981,CANTO VI,7
1982,CANTO VI,
1983,CANTO VI,It was a mighty man whose beardless face
1984,CANTO VI,Beneath grey hair shone out so large and mild
1985,CANTO VI,It made a sort of moonlight in the place.
1986,CANTO VI,"A dreamy desperation, wistful-wild,"
1987,CANTO VI,"Showed in his glance and gait: yet like a child,"
1988,CANTO VI,"An Asian emperor’s only child, was he"
1989,CANTO VI,With his grave looks and bright solemnity.
1990,CANTO VI,
1991,CANTO VI,
1992,CANTO VI,8
1993,CANTO VI,
1994,CANTO VI,"And over him there hung the witching air,"
1995,CANTO VI,"The wilful courtesy, of the days of old."
1996,CANTO VI,The graces wherein idleness grows fair;
1997,CANTO VI,And somewhat in his sauntering walk he rolled
1998,CANTO VI,"And toyed about his waist with seals of gold,"
1999,CANTO VI,"Or stood to ponder often in mid-stride,"
2000,CANTO VI,Tilting his heavy head upon one side.
2001,CANTO VI,
2002,CANTO VI,
2003,CANTO VI,9
2004,CANTO VI,
2005,CANTO VI,"When Dymer had called twice, he turned his eye:"
2006,CANTO VI,"Then, coming out of silence (as a star"
2007,CANTO VI,All in one moment slips into the sky
2008,CANTO VI,"Of evening, yet we feel it comes from far),"
2009,CANTO VI,"He said, “Sir, you are welcome. Few there are"
2010,CANTO VI,That come my way”: and in huge hands he pressed
2011,CANTO VI,Dymer’s cold hand and bade him in to rest.
2012,CANTO VI,
2013,CANTO VI,
2014,CANTO VI,10
2015,CANTO VI,
2016,CANTO VI,“How did you find this place out? Have you heard
2017,CANTO VI,My gun? It was but now I killed a lark.”
2018,CANTO VI,"“What Sir,” said Dymer, “shoot the singing bird?”"
2019,CANTO VI,"“Sir,” said the man, “they sing from dawn till dark,"
2020,CANTO VI,And interrupt my dreams too long. But hark...
2021,CANTO VI,Another? Did you hear no singing? No?
2022,CANTO VI,"It was my fancy, then ... pray, let it go."
2023,CANTO VI,
2024,CANTO VI,
2025,CANTO VI,11
2026,CANTO VI,
2027,CANTO VI,“From here you see my garden’s only flaw.
2028,CANTO VI,"Stand here, Sir, at the dial.” Dymer stood."
2029,CANTO VI,The Master pointed; then he looked and saw
2030,CANTO VI,How hedges and the funeral quietude
2031,CANTO VI,"Of black trees fringed the garden like a wood,"
2032,CANTO VI,"And only, in one place, one gap that showed"
2033,CANTO VI,"The blue side of the hills, the white hill-road."
2034,CANTO VI,
2035,CANTO VI,
2036,CANTO VI,12
2037,CANTO VI,
2038,CANTO VI,"“I have planted fir and larch to fill the gap,”"
2039,CANTO VI,"He said, “because this too makes war upon"
2040,CANTO VI,The art of dream. But by some great mishap
2041,CANTO VI,Nothing I plant will grow there. We pass on....
2042,CANTO VI,The sunshine of the afternoon is gone.
2043,CANTO VI,Let us go in. It draws near time to sup
2044,CANTO VI,--I hate the garden till the moon is up.”
2045,CANTO VI,
2046,CANTO VI,
2047,CANTO VI,13
2048,CANTO VI,
2049,CANTO VI,They passed from the hot lawn into the gloom
2050,CANTO VI,"And coolness of the porch: then, past a door"
2051,CANTO VI,"That opened with no noise, into a room"
2052,CANTO VI,Where green leaves choked the window and the floor
2053,CANTO VI,Sank lower than the ground. A tattered store
2054,CANTO VI,Of brown books met the eye: a crystal ball:
2055,CANTO VI,And masks with empty eyes along the wall.
2056,CANTO VI,
2057,CANTO VI,
2058,CANTO VI,14
2059,CANTO VI,
2060,CANTO VI,"Then Dymer sat, but knew not how nor where,"
2061,CANTO VI,"And supper was set out before these two,"
2062,CANTO VI,--He saw not how--with silver old and rare
2063,CANTO VI,But tarnished. And he ate and never knew
2064,CANTO VI,What meats they were. At every bite he grew
2065,CANTO VI,More drowsy and let slide his crumbling will.
2066,CANTO VI,The Master at his side was talking still.
2067,CANTO VI,
2068,CANTO VI,
2069,CANTO VI,15
2070,CANTO VI,
2071,CANTO VI,And all his talk was tales of magic words
2072,CANTO VI,"And of the nations in the clouds above,"
2073,CANTO VI,Astral and aerish tribes who fish for birds
2074,CANTO VI,With angles. And by history he could prove
2075,CANTO VI,"How chosen spirits from earth had won their love,"
2076,CANTO VI,"As Arthur, or Usheen: and to their isle"
2077,CANTO VI,Went Helen for the sake of a Greek smile.
2078,CANTO VI,
2079,CANTO VI,
2080,CANTO VI,16
2081,CANTO VI,
2082,CANTO VI,And ever in his talk he mustered well
2083,CANTO VI,"His texts and strewed old authors round the way,"
2084,CANTO VI,"“Thus Wierus writes,” and “Thus the Hermetics tell,”"
2085,CANTO VI,"“This was Agrippa’s view,” and “Others say"
2086,CANTO VI,"With Cardan,” till he had stolen quite away"
2087,CANTO VI,Dymer’s dull wits and softly drawn apart
2088,CANTO VI,The ivory gates of hope that change the heart.
2089,CANTO VI,
2090,CANTO VI,
2091,CANTO VI,17
2092,CANTO VI,
2093,CANTO VI,Dymer was talking now. Now Dymer told
2094,CANTO VI,"Of his own love and losing, drowsily."
2095,CANTO VI,"The Master leaned towards him, “Was it cold,"
2096,CANTO VI,"This spirit, to the touch?”--“No, Sir, not she,”"
2097,CANTO VI,Said Dymer. And his host: “Why this must be
2098,CANTO VI,"Aethereal, not aereal! Oh my soul,"
2099,CANTO VI,"Be still ... but wait. Tell on, Sir, tell the whole.”"
2100,CANTO VI,
2101,CANTO VI,
2102,CANTO VI,18
2103,CANTO VI,
2104,CANTO VI,"Then Dymer told him of the beldam too,"
2105,CANTO VI,"The old, old, matriarchal dreadfulness."
2106,CANTO VI,"Over the Master’s face a shadow drew,"
2107,CANTO VI,"He shifted in his chair and “Yes” and “Yes,”"
2108,CANTO VI,He murmured twice. “I never looked for less!
2109,CANTO VI,Always the same ... that frightful woman shape
2110,CANTO VI,Besets the dream-way and the soul’s escape.”
2111,CANTO VI,
2112,CANTO VI,
2113,CANTO VI,19
2114,CANTO VI,
2115,CANTO VI,"But now when Dymer made to talk of Bran,"
2116,CANTO VI,"A huge indifference fell upon his host,"
2117,CANTO VI,"Patient and wandering-eyed. Then he began,"
2118,CANTO VI,“Forgive me. You are young. What helps us most
2119,CANTO VI,Is to find out again that heavenly ghost
2120,CANTO VI,"Who loves you. For she was a ghost, and you"
2121,CANTO VI,In that place where you met were ghostly too.
2122,CANTO VI,
2123,CANTO VI,
2124,CANTO VI,20
2125,CANTO VI,
2126,CANTO VI,“Listen! for I can launch you on the stream
2127,CANTO VI,Will roll you to the shores of her own land....
2128,CANTO VI,"I could be sworn you never learned to dream,"
2129,CANTO VI,But every night you take with careless hand
2130,CANTO VI,What chance may bring? I’ll teach you to command
2131,CANTO VI,The comings and the goings of your spirit
2132,CANTO VI,Through all that borderland which dreams inherit.
2133,CANTO VI,
2134,CANTO VI,
2135,CANTO VI,21
2136,CANTO VI,
2137,CANTO VI,"“You shall have hauntings suddenly. And often,"
2138,CANTO VI,"When you forget, when least you think of her"
2139,CANTO VI,(For so you shall forget) a light will soften
2140,CANTO VI,Over the evening woods. And in the stir
2141,CANTO VI,"Of morning dreams (oh, I will teach you, Sir)"
2142,CANTO VI,There’ll come a sound of wings. Or you shall be
2143,CANTO VI,"Waked in the midnight murmuring, ‘It was she.’”"
2144,CANTO VI,
2145,CANTO VI,
2146,CANTO VI,22
2147,CANTO VI,
2148,CANTO VI,"“No, no,” said Dymer, “not that way. I seem"
2149,CANTO VI,To have slept for twenty years. Now--while I shake
2150,CANTO VI,"Out of my eyes that dust of burdening dream,"
2151,CANTO VI,Now when the long clouds tremble ripe to break
2152,CANTO VI,"And the far hills appear, when first I wake,"
2153,CANTO VI,"Still blinking, struggling towards the world of men,"
2154,CANTO VI,And longing--would you turn me back again?
2155,CANTO VI,
2156,CANTO VI,
2157,CANTO VI,23
2158,CANTO VI,
2159,CANTO VI,“Dreams? I have had my dream too long. I thought
2160,CANTO VI,The sun rose for my sake. I ran down blind
2161,CANTO VI,"And dancing to the abyss. Oh, Sir, I brought"
2162,CANTO VI,Boy-laughter for a gift to Gods who find
2163,CANTO VI,The martyr’s soul too soft But that’s behind.
2164,CANTO VI,I’m waking now. They broke me. All ends thus
2165,CANTO VI,"Always--and we’re for them, not they for us."
2166,CANTO VI,
2167,CANTO VI,
2168,CANTO VI,24
2169,CANTO VI,
2170,CANTO VI,“And she--she was no dream. It would be waste
2171,CANTO VI,"To seek her there, the living in that den"
2172,CANTO VI,Of lies.” The Master smiled. “You are in haste!
2173,CANTO VI,"For broken dreams the cure is, Dream again"
2174,CANTO VI,"And deeper. If the waking world, and men,"
2175,CANTO VI,And nature marred your dream--so much the worse
2176,CANTO VI,For a crude world beneath its primal curse.”
2177,CANTO VI,
2178,CANTO VI,
2179,CANTO VI,25
2180,CANTO VI,
2181,CANTO VI,"--“Ah, but you do not know! Can dreams do this,"
2182,CANTO VI,Pluck out blood-guiltiness upon the shore
2183,CANTO VI,"Of memory--and undo what’s done amiss,"
2184,CANTO VI,And bid the thing that has been be no more?”
2185,CANTO VI,"--“Sir, it is only dreams unlock that door,”"
2186,CANTO VI,He answered with a shrug. “What would you have?
2187,CANTO VI,In dreams the thrice-proved coward can feel brave.
2188,CANTO VI,
2189,CANTO VI,
2190,CANTO VI,26
2191,CANTO VI,
2192,CANTO VI,“In dreams the fool is free from scorning voices.
2193,CANTO VI,Grey-headed whores are virgin there again.
2194,CANTO VI,"Out of the past dream brings long-buried choices,"
2195,CANTO VI,All in a moment snaps the tenfold chain
2196,CANTO VI,That life took years in forging. There the stain
2197,CANTO VI,Of oldest sins--how do the good words go?--
2198,CANTO VI,"Though they were scarlet, shall be white as snow.”"
2199,CANTO VI,
2200,CANTO VI,
2201,CANTO VI,27
2202,CANTO VI,
2203,CANTO VI,"Then, drawing near, when Dymer did not speak,"
2204,CANTO VI,"“My little son,” said he, “your wrong and right"
2205,CANTO VI,Are also dreams: fetters to bind the weak
2206,CANTO VI,Faster to phantom earth and blear the sight.
2207,CANTO VI,"Wake into dreams, into the larger light"
2208,CANTO VI,That quenches these frail stars. They will not know
2209,CANTO VI,Earth’s bye-laws in the land to which you go.”
2210,CANTO VI,
2211,CANTO VI,
2212,CANTO VI,28
2213,CANTO VI,
2214,CANTO VI,"--“I must undo my sins,”--“An earthly law,"
2215,CANTO VI,"And, even in earth, the child of yesterday."
2216,CANTO VI,Throw down your human pity; cast your awe
2217,CANTO VI,Behind you; put repentance all away.
2218,CANTO VI,Home to the elder depths! for never they
2219,CANTO VI,Supped with the stars who dared not slough behind
2220,CANTO VI,The last shred of earth’s holies from their mind.”
2221,CANTO VI,
2222,CANTO VI,
2223,CANTO VI,29
2224,CANTO VI,
2225,CANTO VI,"“Sir,” answered Dymer, “I would be content"
2226,CANTO VI,"To drudge in earth, easing my heart’s disgrace,"
2227,CANTO VI,Counting a year’s long service lightly spent
2228,CANTO VI,If once at the year’s end I saw her face
2229,CANTO VI,"Somewhere, being then most weary, in some place"
2230,CANTO VI,I looked not for that joy--or heard her near
2231,CANTO VI,"Whispering, ‘Yet courage, friend,’ for one more year.”"
2232,CANTO VI,
2233,CANTO VI,
2234,CANTO VI,30
2235,CANTO VI,
2236,CANTO VI,"“Pish,” said the Master. “Will you have the truth?"
2237,CANTO VI,You think that virtue saves? Her people care
2238,CANTO VI,For the high heart and idle hours of youth;
2239,CANTO VI,"For these they will descend our lower air,"
2240,CANTO VI,Not virtue. You would nerve your arm and bear
2241,CANTO VI,"Your burden among men! Look to it, child:"
2242,CANTO VI,By virtue’s self vision can be defiled.
2243,CANTO VI,
2244,CANTO VI,
2245,CANTO VI,31
2246,CANTO VI,
2247,CANTO VI,"“You will grow full of pity and the love of men,"
2248,CANTO VI,And toil until the morning moisture dries
2249,CANTO VI,"Out of your heart. Then once, or once again"
2250,CANTO VI,It may be you will find her: but your eyes
2251,CANTO VI,Soon will be grown too dim. The task that lies
2252,CANTO VI,Next to your hand will hide her. You shall be
2253,CANTO VI,The child of earth and gods you shall not see.”
2254,CANTO VI,
2255,CANTO VI,
2256,CANTO VI,32
2257,CANTO VI,
2258,CANTO VI,Here suddenly he ceased. Tip-toes he went.
2259,CANTO VI,"A bolt clicked--then the window creaked ajar,"
2260,CANTO VI,And out of the wet world the hedgerow scent
2261,CANTO VI,Came floating; and the dark without one star
2262,CANTO VI,"Nor shape of trees nor sense of near and far,"
2263,CANTO VI,The undimensioned night and formless skies
2264,CANTO VI,"Were there, and were the Master’s great allies."
2265,CANTO VI,
2266,CANTO VI,
2267,CANTO VI,33
2268,CANTO VI,
2269,CANTO VI,"“I am very old,” he said. “But if the time"
2270,CANTO VI,"We suffered in our dreams were counting age,"
2271,CANTO VI,I have outlived the ocean and my prime
2272,CANTO VI,Is with me to this day. Years cannot gauge
2273,CANTO VI,"The dream-life. In the turning of a page,"
2274,CANTO VI,"Dozing above my book, I have lived through"
2275,CANTO VI,More ages than the lost Lemuria knew.
2276,CANTO VI,
2277,CANTO VI,
2278,CANTO VI,34
2279,CANTO VI,
2280,CANTO VI,“I am not mortal. Were I doomed to die
2281,CANTO VI,"This hour, in this half-hour I interpose"
2282,CANTO VI,"A thousand years of dream: and, those gone by,"
2283,CANTO VI,"As many more, and in the last of those,"
2284,CANTO VI,Ten thousand--ever journeying towards a close
2285,CANTO VI,"That I shall never reach: for time shall flow,"
2286,CANTO VI,"Wheel within wheel, interminably slow."
2287,CANTO VI,
2288,CANTO VI,
2289,CANTO VI,35
2290,CANTO VI,
2291,CANTO VI,“And you will drink my cup and go your way
2292,CANTO VI,Into the valley of dreams. You have heard the call.
2293,CANTO VI,Come hither and escape. Why should you stay?
2294,CANTO VI,"Earth is a sinking ship, a house whose wall"
2295,CANTO VI,Is tottering while you sweep; the roof will fall
2296,CANTO VI,Before the work is done. You cannot mend it.
2297,CANTO VI,"Patch as you will, at last the rot must end it.”"
2298,CANTO VI,
2299,CANTO VI,
2300,CANTO VI,36
2301,CANTO VI,
2302,CANTO VI,Then Dymer lifted up his heavy head
2303,CANTO VI,Like Atlas on broad shoulders bearing up
2304,CANTO VI,"The insufferable globe. “I had not said,”"
2305,CANTO VI,"He mumbled, “Never said I’d taste the cup."
2306,CANTO VI,"What, is it this you give me? Must I sup?"
2307,CANTO VI,"Oh lies, all lies.... Why did you kill the lark?"
2308,CANTO VI,Guide me the cup to lip ... it is so dark.”
2309,CANTO VI,
2310,CANTO VI,
2311,CANTO VI,
2312,CANTO VI,
2313,CANTO VII,CANTO VII
2314,CANTO VII,
2315,CANTO VII,
2316,CANTO VII,1
2317,CANTO VII,
2318,CANTO VII,The host had trimmed his lamp. The downy moth
2319,CANTO VII,Came from the garden. Where the lamplight shed
2320,CANTO VII,"Its circle of smooth white upon the cloth,"
2321,CANTO VII,"Down mid the rinds of fruit and broken bread,"
2322,CANTO VII,Upon his sprawling arms lay Dymer’s head;
2323,CANTO VII,"And often, as he dreamed, he shifted place,"
2324,CANTO VII,Muttering and showing half his drunken face.
2325,CANTO VII,
2326,CANTO VII,
2327,CANTO VII,2
2328,CANTO VII,
2329,CANTO VII,The beating stillness of the dead of night
2330,CANTO VII,Flooded the room. The dark and sleepy powers
2331,CANTO VII,Settled upon the house and filled it quite;
2332,CANTO VII,"Far from the roads it lay, from belfry towers"
2333,CANTO VII,"And hen-roosts, in a world of folded flowers,"
2334,CANTO VII,Buried in loneliest fields where beasts that love
2335,CANTO VII,The silence through the unrustled hedgegrows move.
2336,CANTO VII,
2337,CANTO VII,
2338,CANTO VII,3
2339,CANTO VII,
2340,CANTO VII,Now from the Master’s lips there breathed a sigh
2341,CANTO VII,As of a man released from some control
2342,CANTO VII,"That wronged him. Without aim his wandering eye,"
2343,CANTO VII,"Unsteadied and unfixed, began to roll."
2344,CANTO VII,His lower lip dropped loose. The informing soul
2345,CANTO VII,Seemed fading from his face. He laughed out loud
2346,CANTO VII,"Once only: then looked round him, hushed and cowed."
2347,CANTO VII,
2348,CANTO VII,
2349,CANTO VII,4
2350,CANTO VII,
2351,CANTO VII,"Then, summoning all himself, with tightened lip,"
2352,CANTO VII,"With desperate coolness and attentive air,"
2353,CANTO VII,"He touched between his thumb and finger tip,"
2354,CANTO VII,"Each in its turn, the four legs of his chair,"
2355,CANTO VII,Then back again in haste--there!--that one there
2356,CANTO VII,Had been forgotten ... once more! ... safer now;
2357,CANTO VII,That’s better! and he smiled and cleared his brow.
2358,CANTO VII,
2359,CANTO VII,
2360,CANTO VII,5
2361,CANTO VII,
2362,CANTO VII,Yet this was but a moment’s ease. Once more
2363,CANTO VII,"He glanced about him like a startled hare,"
2364,CANTO VII,"His big eyes bulged with horror. As before,"
2365,CANTO VII,Quick!--to the touch that saves him. But despair
2366,CANTO VII,Is nearer by one step; and in his chair
2367,CANTO VII,Huddling he waits. He knows that they’ll come strong
2368,CANTO VII,Again and yet again and all night long;
2369,CANTO VII,
2370,CANTO VII,
2371,CANTO VII,6
2372,CANTO VII,
2373,CANTO VII,And after this night comes another night
2374,CANTO VII,--Night after night until the worst of all.
2375,CANTO VII,And now too even the noonday and the light
2376,CANTO VII,"Let through the horrors. Oh, could he recall"
2377,CANTO VII,The deep sleep and the dreams that used to fall
2378,CANTO VII,"Around him for the asking. But, somehow,"
2379,CANTO VII,Something’s amiss ... sleep comes so rarely now.
2380,CANTO VII,
2381,CANTO VII,
2382,CANTO VII,7
2383,CANTO VII,
2384,CANTO VII,"Then, like the dog returning to its vomit,"
2385,CANTO VII,He staggered to the bookcase to renew
2386,CANTO VII,"Yet once again the taint he had taken from it,"
2387,CANTO VII,And shuddered as he went. But horror drew
2388,CANTO VII,"His feet, as joy draws others. There in view"
2389,CANTO VII,"Was his strange heaven and his far stranger hell,"
2390,CANTO VII,"His secret lust, his soul’s dark citadel:--"
2391,CANTO VII,
2392,CANTO VII,
2393,CANTO VII,8
2394,CANTO VII,
2395,CANTO VII,"Old Theogmagia, Demonology,"
2396,CANTO VII,"Cabbala, Chemic Magic, Book of the Dead,"
2397,CANTO VII,Damning Hermetic rolls that none may see
2398,CANTO VII,Save the already damned--such grules are bred
2399,CANTO VII,From minds that lose the Spirit and seek instead
2400,CANTO VII,"For spirits in the dust of dead men’s error,"
2401,CANTO VII,Buying the joys of dream with dreamland terror.
2402,CANTO VII,
2403,CANTO VII,
2404,CANTO VII,9
2405,CANTO VII,
2406,CANTO VII,This lost soul looked them over one and all
2407,CANTO VII,Now sickened at the heart’s root; for he knew
2408,CANTO VII,This night was one of those when he would fall
2409,CANTO VII,And scream alone (such things they made him do)
2410,CANTO VII,And roll upon the floor. The madness grew
2411,CANTO VII,"Wild at his breast, but still his brain was clear"
2412,CANTO VII,That he could watch the moment coming near.
2413,CANTO VII,
2414,CANTO VII,
2415,CANTO VII,10
2416,CANTO VII,
2417,CANTO VII,"But, ere it came, he heard a sound, half groan,"
2418,CANTO VII,"Half muttering, from the table. Like a child"
2419,CANTO VII,"Caught unawares that thought it was alone,"
2420,CANTO VII,"He started as in guilt. His gaze was wild,"
2421,CANTO VII,"Yet pitiably with all his will he smiled,"
2422,CANTO VII,"--So strong is shame, even then. And Dymer stirred,"
2423,CANTO VII,"Now waking, and looked up and spoke one word:"
2424,CANTO VII,
2425,CANTO VII,
2426,CANTO VII,11
2427,CANTO VII,
2428,CANTO VII,“Water!” he said. He was too dazed to see
2429,CANTO VII,"What hell-wrung face looked down, what shaking hand"
2430,CANTO VII,Poured out the draught. He drank it thirstily
2431,CANTO VII,And held the glass for more. “Your land ... your land
2432,CANTO VII,"Of dreams,” he said. “All lies!... I understand"
2433,CANTO VII,"More than I did. Yes, water. I’ve the thirst"
2434,CANTO VII,Of hell itself. Your magic’s all accursed.”
2435,CANTO VII,
2436,CANTO VII,
2437,CANTO VII,12
2438,CANTO VII,
2439,CANTO VII,"When he had drunk again he rose and stood,"
2440,CANTO VII,"Pallid and cold with sleep. “By God,” he said,"
2441,CANTO VII,“You did me wrong to send me to that wood.
2442,CANTO VII,I sought a living spirit and found instead
2443,CANTO VII,Bogys and wraiths.” The Master raised his head
2444,CANTO VII,"Calm as a sage and answered, “Are you mad?"
2445,CANTO VII,"Come, sit you down. Tell me what dream you had.”"
2446,CANTO VII,
2447,CANTO VII,
2448,CANTO VII,13
2449,CANTO VII,
2450,CANTO VII,--“I dreamed about a wood ... an autumn red
2451,CANTO VII,Of beech-trees big as mountains. Down between--
2452,CANTO VII,"The first thing that I saw--a clearing spread,"
2453,CANTO VII,"Deep down, oh, very deep. Like some ravine"
2454,CANTO VII,"Or like a well it sank, that forest green"
2455,CANTO VII,Under its weight of forest--more remote
2456,CANTO VII,Than one ship in a landlocked sea afloat.
2457,CANTO VII,
2458,CANTO VII,
2459,CANTO VII,14
2460,CANTO VII,
2461,CANTO VII,“Then through the narrowed sky some heavy bird
2462,CANTO VII,"Would flap its way, a stillness more profound"
2463,CANTO VII,Following its languid wings. Sometimes I heard
2464,CANTO VII,Far off in the long woods with quiet sound
2465,CANTO VII,"The sudden chestnut thumping to the ground,"
2466,CANTO VII,Or the dry leaf that drifted past upon
2467,CANTO VII,Its endless loiter earthward and was gone.
2468,CANTO VII,
2469,CANTO VII,
2470,CANTO VII,15
2471,CANTO VII,
2472,CANTO VII,“Then next ... I heard twigs splintering on my right
2473,CANTO VII,And rustling in the thickets. Turning there
2474,CANTO VII,I watched. Out of the foliage came in sight
2475,CANTO VII,"The head and blundering shoulders of a bear,"
2476,CANTO VII,"Glistening in sable black, with beady stare"
2477,CANTO VII,"Of eyes towards me, and no room to fly"
2478,CANTO VII,--But padding soft and slow the beast came by.
2479,CANTO VII,
2480,CANTO VII,
2481,CANTO VII,16
2482,CANTO VII,
2483,CANTO VII,“And--mark their flattery--stood and rubbed his flank
2484,CANTO VII,Against me. On my shaken legs I felt
2485,CANTO VII,His heart beat. And my hand that stroked him sank
2486,CANTO VII,Wrist-deep upon his shoulder in soft pelt.
2487,CANTO VII,Yes ... and across my spirit as I smelt
2488,CANTO VII,"The wild thing’s scent, a new, sweet wildness ran"
2489,CANTO VII,Whispering of Eden-fields long lost by man.
2490,CANTO VII,
2491,CANTO VII,
2492,CANTO VII,17
2493,CANTO VII,
2494,CANTO VII,“So far was well. But then came emerald birds
2495,CANTO VII,Singing about my head. I took my way
2496,CANTO VII,"Sauntering the cloistered woods. Then came the herds,"
2497,CANTO VII,The roebuck and the fallow deer at play
2498,CANTO VII,"Trooping to nose my hand. All this, you say,"
2499,CANTO VII,Was sweet? Oh sweet!... do you think I could not see
2500,CANTO VII,That beasts and wood were nothing else but me?
2501,CANTO VII,
2502,CANTO VII,
2503,CANTO VII,18
2504,CANTO VII,
2505,CANTO VII,"“... That I was making everything I saw,"
2506,CANTO VII,"Too sweet, far too well fitted to desire"
2507,CANTO VII,To be a living thing? Those forests draw
2508,CANTO VII,No sap from the kind earth: the solar fire
2509,CANTO VII,And soft rain feed them not: that fairy brier
2510,CANTO VII,Pricks not: the birds sing sweetly in that brake
2511,CANTO VII,Not for their own delight but for my sake!
2512,CANTO VII,
2513,CANTO VII,
2514,CANTO VII,19
2515,CANTO VII,
2516,CANTO VII,"“It is a world of sad, cold, heartless stuff,"
2517,CANTO VII,"Like a bought smile, no joy in it.”--“But stay;"
2518,CANTO VII,Did you not find your lady?”--“Sure enough!
2519,CANTO VII,I still had hopes till then. The autumn day
2520,CANTO VII,"Was westering, the long shadows crossed my way,"
2521,CANTO VII,When over daisies folded for the night
2522,CANTO VII,Beneath rook-gathering elms she came in sight.”
2523,CANTO VII,
2524,CANTO VII,
2525,CANTO VII,20
2526,CANTO VII,
2527,CANTO VII,"--“Was she not fair?”--“So beautiful, she seemed"
2528,CANTO VII,Almost a living soul. But every part
2529,CANTO VII,Was what I made it--all that I had dreamed--
2530,CANTO VII,"No more, no less: the mirror of my heart,"
2531,CANTO VII,Such things as boyhood feigns beneath the smart
2532,CANTO VII,Of solitude and spring. I was deceived
2533,CANTO VII,Almost. In that first moment I believed.
2534,CANTO VII,
2535,CANTO VII,
2536,CANTO VII,21
2537,CANTO VII,
2538,CANTO VII,"“For a big, brooding rapture, tense as fire"
2539,CANTO VII,And calm as a first sleep had soaked me through
2540,CANTO VII,"Without thought, without word, without desire...."
2541,CANTO VII,Meanwhile above our heads the deepening blue
2542,CANTO VII,Burnished the gathering stars. Her sweetness drew
2543,CANTO VII,A veil before my eyes. The minutes passed
2544,CANTO VII,Heavy like loaded vines. She spoke at last.
2545,CANTO VII,
2546,CANTO VII,
2547,CANTO VII,22
2548,CANTO VII,
2549,CANTO VII,"“She said, for this land only did men love"
2550,CANTO VII,The shadow-lands of earth. All our disease
2551,CANTO VII,"Of longing, all the hopes we fabled of,"
2552,CANTO VII,Fortunate islands or Hesperean seas
2553,CANTO VII,"Or woods beyond the West, were but the breeze"
2554,CANTO VII,That blew from off those shores: one farspent breath
2555,CANTO VII,That reached even to the world of change and death.
2556,CANTO VII,
2557,CANTO VII,
2558,CANTO VII,23
2559,CANTO VII,
2560,CANTO VII,“She told me I had journeyed home at last
2561,CANTO VII,Into the golden age and the good countrie
2562,CANTO VII,That had been always there. She bade me cast
2563,CANTO VII,My cares behind forever:--on her knee
2564,CANTO VII,"Worshipped me, lord and love--oh, I can see"
2565,CANTO VII,Her red lips even now! Is it not wrong
2566,CANTO VII,That men’s delusions should be made so strong?
2567,CANTO VII,
2568,CANTO VII,
2569,CANTO VII,24
2570,CANTO VII,
2571,CANTO VII,"“For listen, I was so besotted now"
2572,CANTO VII,She made me think that I was somehow seeing
2573,CANTO VII,"The very core of truth ... I felt somehow,"
2574,CANTO VII,"Beyond all veils, the inward pulse of being."
2575,CANTO VII,"Thought was enslaved, but oh, it felt like freeing"
2576,CANTO VII,And draughts of larger air. It is too much!
2577,CANTO VII,Who can come through untainted from that touch?
2578,CANTO VII,
2579,CANTO VII,
2580,CANTO VII,25
2581,CANTO VII,
2582,CANTO VII,“There I was nearly wrecked. But mark the rest:
2583,CANTO VII,She went too fast. Soft to my arms she came.
2584,CANTO VII,The robe slipped from her shoulder. The smooth breast
2585,CANTO VII,Was bare against my own. She shone like flame
2586,CANTO VII,"Before me in the dusk, all love, all shame--"
2587,CANTO VII,"Faugh!--and it was myself. But all was well,"
2588,CANTO VII,"For, at the least, that moment snapped the spell."
2589,CANTO VII,
2590,CANTO VII,
2591,CANTO VII,26
2592,CANTO VII,
2593,CANTO VII,"“As when you light a candle, the great gloom"
2594,CANTO VII,"Which was the unbounded night, sinks down, compressed"
2595,CANTO VII,"To four white walls in one familiar room,"
2596,CANTO VII,So the vague joy shrank wilted in my breast
2597,CANTO VII,"And narrowed to one point, unmasked, confessed;"
2598,CANTO VII,Fool’s paradise was gone: instead was there
2599,CANTO VII,"King Lust with his black, sudden, serious stare."
2600,CANTO VII,
2601,CANTO VII,
2602,CANTO VII,27
2603,CANTO VII,
2604,CANTO VII,“That moment in a cloud among the trees
2605,CANTO VII,Wild music and the glare of torches came.
2606,CANTO VII,"On sweated faces, on the prancing knees"
2607,CANTO VII,"Of shaggy satyrs fell the smoky flame,"
2608,CANTO VII,"On ape and goat and crawlers without name,"
2609,CANTO VII,"On rolling breast, black eyes and tossing hair,"
2610,CANTO VII,"On old bald-headed witches, lean and bare."
2611,CANTO VII,
2612,CANTO VII,
2613,CANTO VII,28
2614,CANTO VII,
2615,CANTO VII,“They beat the devilish tom-tom rub-a-dub;
2616,CANTO VII,"Lunging, leaping, in unwieldy romp,"
2617,CANTO VII,"Singing Cotytto and Beelzebub,"
2618,CANTO VII,"With devil dancers mask and phallic pomp,"
2619,CANTO VII,Torn raw with briers and caked from many a swamp
2620,CANTO VII,"They came, among the wild flowers dripping blood"
2621,CANTO VII,And churning the green mosses into mud.
2622,CANTO VII,
2623,CANTO VII,
2624,CANTO VII,29
2625,CANTO VII,
2626,CANTO VII,"“They sang, ‘Return! Return! We are the lust"
2627,CANTO VII,That was before the world and still shall be
2628,CANTO VII,"When your last law is trampled into dust,"
2629,CANTO VII,"We are the mother swamp, the primal sea"
2630,CANTO VII,"Whence the dry land appeared. Old, old are we."
2631,CANTO VII,"It is but a return ... it’s nothing new,"
2632,CANTO VII,Easy as slipping on a well-worn shoe.’
2633,CANTO VII,
2634,CANTO VII,
2635,CANTO VII,30
2636,CANTO VII,
2637,CANTO VII,“And then there came warm mouths and finger-tips
2638,CANTO VII,"Preying upon me, whence I could not see,"
2639,CANTO VII,"Then ... a huge face, low browed, with swollen lips"
2640,CANTO VII,"Crooning ‘I am not beautiful as she,"
2641,CANTO VII,But I’m the older love; you shall love me
2642,CANTO VII,Far more than Beauty’s self. You have been ours
2643,CANTO VII,Always. We are the world’s most ancient powers.’
2644,CANTO VII,
2645,CANTO VII,
2646,CANTO VII,31
2647,CANTO VII,
2648,CANTO VII,“First flatterer and then bogy--like a dream!
2649,CANTO VII,"Sir, are you listening? Do you also know"
2650,CANTO VII,How close to the soft laughter comes the scream
2651,CANTO VII,"Down yonder?” But his host cried sharply, “No."
2652,CANTO VII,Leave me alone. Why will you plague me? Go!
2653,CANTO VII,"Out of my house! Begone.”--“With all my heart,”"
2654,CANTO VII,Said Dymer. “But one word before we part.”
2655,CANTO VII,
2656,CANTO VII,
2657,CANTO VII,32
2658,CANTO VII,
2659,CANTO VII,"He paused, and in his cheek the anger burned:"
2660,CANTO VII,"Then turning to the table, he poured out"
2661,CANTO VII,More water. But before he drank he turned--
2662,CANTO VII,Then leaped back to the window with a shout
2663,CANTO VII,For there--it was no dream--beyond all doubt
2664,CANTO VII,He saw the Master crouch with levelled gun
2665,CANTO VII,"Cackling in maniac voice, “Run, Dymer, run!”"
2666,CANTO VII,
2667,CANTO VII,
2668,CANTO VII,33
2669,CANTO VII,
2670,CANTO VII,He ducked and sprang far out. The starless night
2671,CANTO VII,On the wet lawn closed round him every way.
2672,CANTO VII,Then came the gun-crack and the splash of light
2673,CANTO VII,Vanished as soon as seen. Cool garden clay
2674,CANTO VII,Slid from his feet. He had fallen and he lay
2675,CANTO VII,Face downward among leaves--then up and on
2676,CANTO VII,Through branch and leaf till sense and breath were gone.
2677,CANTO VII,
2678,CANTO VII,
2679,CANTO VII,
2680,CANTO VII,
2681,CANTO VIII,CANTO VIII
2682,CANTO VIII,
2683,CANTO VIII,
2684,CANTO VIII,1
2685,CANTO VIII,
2686,CANTO VIII,"When next he found himself no house was there,"
2687,CANTO VIII,No garden and great trees. Beside a lane
2688,CANTO VIII,In grass he lay. Now first he was aware
2689,CANTO VIII,"That, all one side, his body glowed with pain:"
2690,CANTO VIII,And the next moment and the next again
2691,CANTO VIII,Was neither less nor more. Without a pause
2692,CANTO VIII,It clung like a great beast with fastened claws;
2693,CANTO VIII,
2694,CANTO VIII,
2695,CANTO VIII,2
2696,CANTO VIII,
2697,CANTO VIII,That for a time he could not frame a thought
2698,CANTO VIII,"Nor know himself for self, nor pain for pain,"
2699,CANTO VIII,Till moment added on to moment taught
2700,CANTO VIII,"The new, strange art of living on that plane,"
2701,CANTO VIII,"Taught how the grappled soul must still remain,"
2702,CANTO VIII,Still choose and think and understand beneath
2703,CANTO VIII,The very grinding of the ogre’s teeth.
2704,CANTO VIII,
2705,CANTO VIII,
2706,CANTO VIII,3
2707,CANTO VIII,
2708,CANTO VIII,"He heard the wind along the hedges sweep,"
2709,CANTO VIII,The quarter striking from a neighbouring tower.
2710,CANTO VIII,About him was the weight of the world’s sleep;
2711,CANTO VIII,"Within, the thundering pain. That quiet hour"
2712,CANTO VIII,"Heeded it not. It throbbed, it raged with power"
2713,CANTO VIII,Fit to convulse the heavens; and at his side
2714,CANTO VIII,The soft peace drenched the meadows far and wide.
2715,CANTO VIII,
2716,CANTO VIII,
2717,CANTO VIII,4
2718,CANTO VIII,
2719,CANTO VIII,"The air was cold, the earth was cold with dew,"
2720,CANTO VIII,The hedge behind him dark as ink. But now
2721,CANTO VIII,The clouds broke and a paler heaven showed through
2722,CANTO VIII,"Spacious with sudden stars, breathing somehow"
2723,CANTO VIII,The sense of change to slumbering lands. A cow
2724,CANTO VIII,Coughed in the fields behind. The puddles showed
2725,CANTO VIII,Like pools of sky amid the darker road.
2726,CANTO VIII,
2727,CANTO VIII,
2728,CANTO VIII,5
2729,CANTO VIII,
2730,CANTO VIII,And he could see his own limbs faintly white
2731,CANTO VIII,And the blood black upon them. Then by chance
2732,CANTO VIII,He turned ... and it was strange; there at his right
2733,CANTO VIII,"He saw a woman standing, and her glance"
2734,CANTO VIII,Met his: and at the meeting his deep trance
2735,CANTO VIII,"Changed not, and while he looked the knowledge grew"
2736,CANTO VIII,She was not of the old life but the new.
2737,CANTO VIII,
2738,CANTO VIII,
2739,CANTO VIII,6
2740,CANTO VIII,
2741,CANTO VIII,"“Who is it?” he said. “The loved one, the long lost.”"
2742,CANTO VIII,He stared upon her. “Truly?”--“Truly indeed.”
2743,CANTO VIII,"“Oh, lady, you come late. I am tempest-tossed,"
2744,CANTO VIII,"Broken and wrecked. I am dying. Look, I bleed."
2745,CANTO VIII,Why have you left me thus and given no heed
2746,CANTO VIII,To all my prayers?--left me to be the game
2747,CANTO VIII,Of all deceits?”--“You should have asked my name.”
2748,CANTO VIII,
2749,CANTO VIII,
2750,CANTO VIII,7
2751,CANTO VIII,
2752,CANTO VIII,"--“What are you, then?” But to his sudden cry"
2753,CANTO VIII,She did not answer. When he had thought awhile
2754,CANTO VIII,He said: “How can I tell it is no lie?
2755,CANTO VIII,It may be one more phantom to beguile
2756,CANTO VIII,The brain-sick dreamer with its harlot smile.”
2757,CANTO VIII,"“I have not smiled,” she said. The neighbouring bell"
2758,CANTO VIII,Tolled out another quarter. Silence fell.
2759,CANTO VIII,
2760,CANTO VIII,
2761,CANTO VIII,8
2762,CANTO VIII,
2763,CANTO VIII,And after a long pause he spoke again:
2764,CANTO VIII,"“Leave me,” he said. “Why do you watch with me?"
2765,CANTO VIII,You do not love me. Human tears and pain
2766,CANTO VIII,"And hoping for the things that cannot be,"
2767,CANTO VIII,"And blundering in the night where none can see,"
2768,CANTO VIII,"And courage with cold back against the wall,"
2769,CANTO VIII,You do not understand.”--“I know them all.
2770,CANTO VIII,
2771,CANTO VIII,
2772,CANTO VIII,9
2773,CANTO VIII,
2774,CANTO VIII,"“The gods themselves know pain, the eternal forms."
2775,CANTO VIII,"In realms beyond the reach of cloud, and skies"
2776,CANTO VIII,"Nearest the ends of air, where come no storms"
2777,CANTO VIII,"Nor sound of earth, I have looked into their eyes"
2778,CANTO VIII,"Peaceful and filled with pain beyond surmise,"
2779,CANTO VIII,Filled with an ancient woe man cannot reach
2780,CANTO VIII,One moment though in fire; yet calm their speech.”
2781,CANTO VIII,
2782,CANTO VIII,
2783,CANTO VIII,10
2784,CANTO VIII,
2785,CANTO VIII,"“Then these,” said Dymer, “were the world I wooed ..."
2786,CANTO VIII,These were the holiness of flowers and grass
2787,CANTO VIII,"And desolate dews ... these, the eternal mood"
2788,CANTO VIII,Blowing the eternal theme through men that pass.
2789,CANTO VIII,I called myself their lover--I that was
2790,CANTO VIII,Less fit for that long service than the least
2791,CANTO VIII,"Dull, workday drudge of men or faithful beast."
2792,CANTO VIII,
2793,CANTO VIII,
2794,CANTO VIII,11
2795,CANTO VIII,
2796,CANTO VIII,"“Why do they lure to them such spirits as mine,"
2797,CANTO VIII,"The weak, the passionate, and the fool of dreams?"
2798,CANTO VIII,When better men go safe and never pine
2799,CANTO VIII,"With whisperings at the heart, soul-sickening gleams"
2800,CANTO VIII,"Of infinite desire, and joy that seems"
2801,CANTO VIII,"The promise of full power? For it was they,"
2802,CANTO VIII,The gods themselves that led me on this way.
2803,CANTO VIII,
2804,CANTO VIII,
2805,CANTO VIII,12
2806,CANTO VIII,
2807,CANTO VIII,“Give me the truth! I ask not now for pity.
2808,CANTO VIII,"When gods call, can the following them be sin?"
2809,CANTO VIII,Was it false light that lured me from the City?
2810,CANTO VIII,Where was the path--without it or within?
2811,CANTO VIII,Must it be one blind throw to lose or win?
2812,CANTO VIII,Has heaven no voice to help? Must things of dust
2813,CANTO VIII,"Guess their own way in the dark?” She said, “They must.”"
2814,CANTO VIII,
2815,CANTO VIII,
2816,CANTO VIII,13
2817,CANTO VIII,
2818,CANTO VIII,"Another silence: then he cried in wrath,"
2819,CANTO VIII,"“You came in human shape, in sweet disguise"
2820,CANTO VIII,"Wooing me, lurking for me in my path,"
2821,CANTO VIII,"Hid your eternal cold with woman’s eyes,"
2822,CANTO VIII,Snared me with shows of love--and all was lies.”
2823,CANTO VIII,"She answered, “For our kind must come to all"
2824,CANTO VIII,"If bidden, but in the shape for which they call.”"
2825,CANTO VIII,
2826,CANTO VIII,
2827,CANTO VIII,14
2828,CANTO VIII,
2829,CANTO VIII,"“What,” answered Dymer. “Do you change and sway"
2830,CANTO VIII,"To serve us, as the obedient planets spin"
2831,CANTO VIII,About the sun? Are you but potter’s clay
2832,CANTO VIII,For us to mould--unholy to our sin
2833,CANTO VIII,And holy to the holiness within?”
2834,CANTO VIII,"She said, “Waves fall on many an unclean shore,"
2835,CANTO VIII,Yet the salt seas are holy as before.
2836,CANTO VIII,
2837,CANTO VIII,
2838,CANTO VIII,15
2839,CANTO VIII,
2840,CANTO VIII,“Our nature is no purer for the saint
2841,CANTO VIII,"That worships, nor from him that uses ill"
2842,CANTO VIII,"Our beauty, can we suffer any taint."
2843,CANTO VIII,"As from the first we were, so are we still:"
2844,CANTO VIII,With incorruptibles the mortal will
2845,CANTO VIII,"Corrupts itself, and clouded eyes will make"
2846,CANTO VIII,Darkness within from beams they cannot take.”
2847,CANTO VIII,
2848,CANTO VIII,
2849,CANTO VIII,16
2850,CANTO VIII,
2851,CANTO VIII,"“Well ... it is well,” said Dymer. “If I have used"
2852,CANTO VIII,The embreathing spirit amiss ... what would have been
2853,CANTO VIII,The strength of all my days I have refused
2854,CANTO VIII,"And plucked the stalk, too hasty, in the green,"
2855,CANTO VIII,"Trusted the good for best, and having seen"
2856,CANTO VIII,"Half-beauty, or beauty’s fringe, the lowest stair,"
2857,CANTO VIII,"The common incantation, worshipped there.”"
2858,CANTO VIII,
2859,CANTO VIII,
2860,CANTO VIII,17
2861,CANTO VIII,
2862,CANTO VIII,"But presently he cried in his great pain,"
2863,CANTO VIII,"“If I had loved a beast it would repay,"
2864,CANTO VIII,But I have loved the Spirit and loved in vain.
2865,CANTO VIII,"Now let me die ... ah, but before the way"
2866,CANTO VIII,"Is ended quite, in the last hour of day,"
2867,CANTO VIII,"Is there no word of comfort, no one kiss"
2868,CANTO VIII,Of human love? Does it all end in this?”
2869,CANTO VIII,
2870,CANTO VIII,
2871,CANTO VIII,18
2872,CANTO VIII,
2873,CANTO VIII,"She answered, “Never ask of life and death."
2874,CANTO VIII,Uttering these names you dream of wormy clay
2875,CANTO VIII,Or of surviving ghosts. This withering breath
2876,CANTO VIII,Of words is the beginning of decay
2877,CANTO VIII,"In truth, when truth grows cold and pines away"
2878,CANTO VIII,Among the ancestral images. Your eyes
2879,CANTO VIII,"First see her dead: and more, the more she dies."
2880,CANTO VIII,
2881,CANTO VIII,
2882,CANTO VIII,19
2883,CANTO VIII,
2884,CANTO VIII,"“You are still dreaming, dreams you shall forget"
2885,CANTO VIII,"When you have cast your fetters, far from here."
2886,CANTO VIII,"Go forth, the journey is not ended yet."
2887,CANTO VIII,You have seen Dymer dead and on the bier
2888,CANTO VIII,"More often than you dream and dropped no tear,"
2889,CANTO VIII,You have slain him every hour. Think not at all
2890,CANTO VIII,Of death lest into death by thought you fall.”
2891,CANTO VIII,
2892,CANTO VIII,
2893,CANTO VIII,20
2894,CANTO VIII,
2895,CANTO VIII,"He turned to question her, then looked again,"
2896,CANTO VIII,And lo! the shape was gone. The darkness lay
2897,CANTO VIII,"Heavy as yet and a cold, shifting rain"
2898,CANTO VIII,Fell with the breeze that springs before the day.
2899,CANTO VIII,It was an hour death loves. Across the way
2900,CANTO VIII,The clock struck once again. He saw near by
2901,CANTO VIII,The black shape of the tower against the sky.
2902,CANTO VIII,
2903,CANTO VIII,
2904,CANTO VIII,21
2905,CANTO VIII,
2906,CANTO VIII,Meanwhile above the torture and the riot
2907,CANTO VIII,"Of leaping pulse and nerve that shot with pain,"
2908,CANTO VIII,Somewhere aloof and poised in spectral quiet
2909,CANTO VIII,His soul was thinking on. The dizzied brain
2910,CANTO VIII,Scarce seemed her organ: link by link the chain
2911,CANTO VIII,That bound him to the flesh was loosening fast
2912,CANTO VIII,And the new life breathed in unmoved and vast.
2913,CANTO VIII,
2914,CANTO VIII,
2915,CANTO VIII,22
2916,CANTO VIII,
2917,CANTO VIII,"“It was like this,” he thought. “Like this, or worse"
2918,CANTO VIII,For him that I found bleeding in the wood ...
2919,CANTO VIII,Blessings upon him ... there I learned the curse
2920,CANTO VIII,"That rests on Dymer’s name, and truth was good."
2921,CANTO VIII,"He has forgotten now the fire and blood,"
2922,CANTO VIII,He has forgotten that there was a man
2923,CANTO VIII,Called Dymer. He knows not himself nor Bran.
2924,CANTO VIII,
2925,CANTO VIII,
2926,CANTO VIII,23
2927,CANTO VIII,
2928,CANTO VIII,“How long have I been moved at heart in vain
2929,CANTO VIII,"About this Dymer, thinking this was I ..."
2930,CANTO VIII,Why did I follow close his joy and pain
2931,CANTO VIII,"More than another man’s? For he will die,"
2932,CANTO VIII,The little cloud will vanish and the sky
2933,CANTO VIII,Reigns as before. The stars remain and earth
2934,CANTO VIII,"And Man, as in the years before my birth."
2935,CANTO VIII,
2936,CANTO VIII,
2937,CANTO VIII,24
2938,CANTO VIII,
2939,CANTO VIII,“There was a Dymer once who worked and played
2940,CANTO VIII,About the City; I sloughed him off and ran.
2941,CANTO VIII,There was a Dymer in the forest glade
2942,CANTO VIII,"Ranting alone, skulking the fates of man."
2943,CANTO VIII,"I cast him also, and a third began"
2944,CANTO VIII,And he too died. But I am none of those.
2945,CANTO VIII,Is there another still to die.... Who knows?”
2946,CANTO VIII,
2947,CANTO VIII,
2948,CANTO VIII,25
2949,CANTO VIII,
2950,CANTO VIII,"Then in his pain, half wondering what he did,"
2951,CANTO VIII,He made to struggle towards that belfried place.
2952,CANTO VIII,And groaning down the sodden bank he slid
2953,CANTO VIII,And groaning in the lane he felt his trace
2954,CANTO VIII,Of bloodied mire: then halted with his face
2955,CANTO VIII,"Upwards, towards the gateway, breathing hard"
2956,CANTO VIII,--An old lych-gate before a burial-yard.
2957,CANTO VIII,
2958,CANTO VIII,
2959,CANTO VIII,26
2960,CANTO VIII,
2961,CANTO VIII,"He looked within. Between the huddling crosses,"
2962,CANTO VIII,Over the slanted tombs and sunken slate
2963,CANTO VIII,"Spread the deep quiet grass and humble mosses,"
2964,CANTO VIII,"A green and growing darkness, drenched of late,"
2965,CANTO VIII,Smelling of earth and damp. He reached the gate
2966,CANTO VIII,"With failing hand. “I will rest here,” he said,"
2967,CANTO VIII,“And the long grass will cool my burning head.”
2968,CANTO VIII,
2969,CANTO VIII,
2970,CANTO VIII,
2971,CANTO VIII,
2972,CANTO IX,CANTO IX
2973,CANTO IX,
2974,CANTO IX,
2975,CANTO IX,1
2976,CANTO IX,
2977,CANTO IX,Even as he heard the wicket clash behind
2978,CANTO IX,Came a great wind beneath that seemed to tear
2979,CANTO IX,The solid graves apart; and deaf and blind
2980,CANTO IX,"Whirled him upright like smoke, through towering air."
2981,CANTO IX,Whose levels were as steps of a sky stair.
2982,CANTO IX,The parching cold roughened his throat with thirst
2983,CANTO IX,And pricked him at the heart. This was the first.
2984,CANTO IX,
2985,CANTO IX,
2986,CANTO IX,2
2987,CANTO IX,
2988,CANTO IX,"And as he soared into the next degree,"
2989,CANTO IX,Suddenly all around him he could hear
2990,CANTO IX,Sad strings that fretted inconsolably
2991,CANTO IX,And ominous horns that blew both far and near.
2992,CANTO IX,"There broke his human heart, and his last tear"
2993,CANTO IX,Froze scalding on his chin. But while he heard
2994,CANTO IX,He shot like a sped dart into the third.
2995,CANTO IX,
2996,CANTO IX,
2997,CANTO IX,3
2998,CANTO IX,
2999,CANTO IX,And its first stroke of silence could destroy
3000,CANTO IX,The spring of tears forever and compress
3001,CANTO IX,From off his lips the curved bow of the boy
3002,CANTO IX,Forever. The sidereal loneliness
3003,CANTO IX,"Received him, where no journeying leaves the less"
3004,CANTO IX,"Still to be journeyed through: but everywhere,"
3005,CANTO IX,"Fast though you fly, the centre still is there."
3006,CANTO IX,
3007,CANTO IX,
3008,CANTO IX,4
3009,CANTO IX,
3010,CANTO IX,"And here the well-worn fabric of our life,"
3011,CANTO IX,"Fell from him. Hope and purpose were cut short,"
3012,CANTO IX,--Even the blind trust that reaches in mid-strife
3013,CANTO IX,Towards some heart of things. Here blew the mort
3014,CANTO IX,For the world spirit herself. The last support
3015,CANTO IX,"Was fallen away--Himself, one spark of soul,"
3016,CANTO IX,"Swam in unbroken void. He was the whole,"
3017,CANTO IX,
3018,CANTO IX,
3019,CANTO IX,5
3020,CANTO IX,
3021,CANTO IX,And wailing: “Why hast Thou forsaken me?
3022,CANTO IX,"Was there no world at all, but only I"
3023,CANTO IX,Dreaming of gods and men?” Then suddenly
3024,CANTO IX,He felt the wind no more: he seemed to fly
3025,CANTO IX,Faster than light but free; and scaled the sky
3026,CANTO IX,In his own strength--as if a falling stone
3027,CANTO IX,Should wake to find the world’s will was its own.
3028,CANTO IX,
3029,CANTO IX,
3030,CANTO IX,6
3031,CANTO IX,
3032,CANTO IX,"And on the instant, straight before his eyes"
3033,CANTO IX,He looked and saw a sentry shape that stood
3034,CANTO IX,"Leaning upon its spear, with hurrying skies"
3035,CANTO IX,Behind it and a moonset red as blood.
3036,CANTO IX,Upon its head were helmet and mailed hood
3037,CANTO IX,"And shield upon its arm and sword at thigh,"
3038,CANTO IX,All black and pointed sharp against the sky.
3039,CANTO IX,
3040,CANTO IX,
3041,CANTO IX,7
3042,CANTO IX,
3043,CANTO IX,"Then came the clink of metal, the dry sound"
3044,CANTO IX,"Of steel on rock, and challenge: “Who comes here?”"
3045,CANTO IX,"And as he heard it, Dymer at one bound"
3046,CANTO IX,"Stood in the stranger’s shadow, with the spear"
3047,CANTO IX,Between them. And his human face came near
3048,CANTO IX,That larger face. “What watch is this you keep?”
3049,CANTO IX,"Said Dymer, “On the edge of such a deep.”"
3050,CANTO IX,
3051,CANTO IX,
3052,CANTO IX,8
3053,CANTO IX,
3054,CANTO IX,"And answer came, “I watch both night and day"
3055,CANTO IX,This frontier ... there are beasts of the upper air
3056,CANTO IX,As beasts of the deep sea ... one walks this way
3057,CANTO IX,"Night after night, far scouring from his lair,"
3058,CANTO IX,Chewing the cud of lusts which are despair
3059,CANTO IX,"And fill not, while his mouth gapes dry for bliss"
3060,CANTO IX,That never was.”--“What kind of beast is this?”
3061,CANTO IX,
3062,CANTO IX,
3063,CANTO IX,9
3064,CANTO IX,
3065,CANTO IX,"“A kind of things escaped that have no home,"
3066,CANTO IX,"Hunters of men. They love the spring uncurled,"
3067,CANTO IX,"The will worn down, the wearied hour. They come"
3068,CANTO IX,At night-time when the mask is off the world
3069,CANTO IX,And the soul’s gate ill-locked and the flag furled
3070,CANTO IX,"--Then, softly, a pale swarm, and in disguise"
3071,CANTO IX,"Flit past the drowsy watchman, small as flies.”"
3072,CANTO IX,
3073,CANTO IX,
3074,CANTO IX,10
3075,CANTO IX,
3076,CANTO IX,“I’ll see this aerish beast whereof you speak.
3077,CANTO IX,"I’ll share the watch with you.”--“Nay, little One,"
3078,CANTO IX,Begone. You are of earth. The flesh is weak....”
3079,CANTO IX,"--“What is the flesh to me? My course is run,"
3080,CANTO IX,"All but some deed still waiting to be done,"
3081,CANTO IX,"Some moment I may rise on, as the boat"
3082,CANTO IX,Lifts with the lifting tide and steals afloat.
3083,CANTO IX,
3084,CANTO IX,
3085,CANTO IX,11
3086,CANTO IX,
3087,CANTO IX,"“You are a spirit, and it is well with you,"
3088,CANTO IX,"But I am come out of great folly and shame,"
3089,CANTO IX,"The sack of cities, wrongs I must undo...."
3090,CANTO IX,"But tell me of the beast, and whence it came;"
3091,CANTO IX,Who were its sire and dam? What is its name?”
3092,CANTO IX,--“It is my kin. All monsters are the brood
3093,CANTO IX,"Of heaven and earth, and mixed with holy blood.”"
3094,CANTO IX,
3095,CANTO IX,
3096,CANTO IX,12
3097,CANTO IX,
3098,CANTO IX,"--“How can this be?”--“My son, sit here awhile."
3099,CANTO IX,There is a lady in that primal place
3100,CANTO IX,"Where I was born, who with her ancient smile"
3101,CANTO IX,Made glad the sons of heaven. She loved to chase
3102,CANTO IX,The springtime round the world. To all your race
3103,CANTO IX,She was a sudden quivering in the wood
3104,CANTO IX,Or a new thought springing in solitude.
3105,CANTO IX,
3106,CANTO IX,
3107,CANTO IX,13
3108,CANTO IX,
3109,CANTO IX,"“Till, in prodigious hour, one swollen with youth,"
3110,CANTO IX,"Blind from new broken prison, knowing not"
3111,CANTO IX,"Himself nor her, nor how to mate with truth,"
3112,CANTO IX,"Lay with her in a strange and secret spot,"
3113,CANTO IX,"Mortal with her immortal, and begot"
3114,CANTO IX,This walker-in-the-night.”--“But did you know
3115,CANTO IX,This mortal’s name?”--“Why ... it was long ago.
3116,CANTO IX,
3117,CANTO IX,
3118,CANTO IX,14
3119,CANTO IX,
3120,CANTO IX,"“And yet, I think, I bear the name in mind;"
3121,CANTO IX,It was some famished boy whom tampering men
3122,CANTO IX,Had crippled in their chains and made him blind
3123,CANTO IX,Till their weak hour discovered them: and then
3124,CANTO IX,"He broke that prison. Softly!--it comes again,"
3125,CANTO IX,"I have it. It was Dymer, Little One,"
3126,CANTO IX,Dymer’s the name. This spectre is his son.”
3127,CANTO IX,
3128,CANTO IX,
3129,CANTO IX,15
3130,CANTO IX,
3131,CANTO IX,"Then, after silence, came an answering shout"
3132,CANTO IX,"From Dymer, glad and full: “Break off! Dismiss!"
3133,CANTO IX,Your watch is ended and your lamp is out
3134,CANTO IX,"Unarm, unarm. Return into your bliss."
3135,CANTO IX,"You are relieved, Sir. I must deal with this"
3136,CANTO IX,As in my right. For either I must slay
3137,CANTO IX,This beast or else be slain before the day.”
3138,CANTO IX,
3139,CANTO IX,
3140,CANTO IX,16
3141,CANTO IX,
3142,CANTO IX,"“So mortal and so brave?” that other said,"
3143,CANTO IX,"Smiling, and turned and looked in Dymer’s eyes,"
3144,CANTO IX,Scanning him over twice from heel to head
3145,CANTO IX,"--Like an old sergeant’s glance, grown battle wise"
3146,CANTO IX,"To know the points of men. At last, “Arise,”"
3147,CANTO IX,"He said, “and wear my arms. I can withhold"
3148,CANTO IX,Nothing; for such an hour has been foretold.”
3149,CANTO IX,
3150,CANTO IX,
3151,CANTO IX,17
3152,CANTO IX,
3153,CANTO IX,"Thereat, with lips as cold as the sea-surge,"
3154,CANTO IX,"He kissed the youth, and bending on one knee"
3155,CANTO IX,Put all his armour off and let emerge
3156,CANTO IX,Angelic shoulders marbled gloriously
3157,CANTO IX,"And feet like frozen speed and, plain to see,"
3158,CANTO IX,"On his wide breast dark wounds and ancient scars,"
3159,CANTO IX,The battle honours of celestial wars.
3160,CANTO IX,
3161,CANTO IX,
3162,CANTO IX,18
3163,CANTO IX,
3164,CANTO IX,Then like a squire or brother born he dressed
3165,CANTO IX,"The young man in those plates, that dripped with cold"
3166,CANTO IX,"Upon the inside, trickling over breast"
3167,CANTO IX,"And shoulder: but without, the figured gold"
3168,CANTO IX,"Gave to the tinkling ice its jagged hold,"
3169,CANTO IX,And the icy spear froze fast to Dymer’s hand.
3170,CANTO IX,But where the other had stood he took his stand
3171,CANTO IX,
3172,CANTO IX,
3173,CANTO IX,19
3174,CANTO IX,
3175,CANTO IX,And searched the cloudy landscape. He could see
3176,CANTO IX,"Dim shapes like hills appearing, but the moon"
3177,CANTO IX,Had sunk behind their backs. “When will it be?”
3178,CANTO IX,"Said Dymer: and the other, “Soon now, soon."
3179,CANTO IX,For either he comes past us at night’s noon
3180,CANTO IX,"Or else between the night and the full day,"
3181,CANTO IX,"And down there, on your left, will be his way.”"
3182,CANTO IX,
3183,CANTO IX,
3184,CANTO IX,20
3185,CANTO IX,
3186,CANTO IX,--“Swear that you will not come between us two
3187,CANTO IX,Nor help me by a hair’s weight if I bow.”
3188,CANTO IX,"--“If you are he, if prophesies speak true,"
3189,CANTO IX,Not heaven and all the gods can help you now.
3190,CANTO IX,"This much I have been told, but know not how"
3191,CANTO IX,The fight will end. Who knows? I cannot tell.”
3192,CANTO IX,"“Sir, be content,” said Dymer. “I know well.”"
3193,CANTO IX,
3194,CANTO IX,
3195,CANTO IX,21
3196,CANTO IX,
3197,CANTO IX,"Thus Dymer stood to arms, with eyes that ranged"
3198,CANTO IX,"Through aching darkness: stared upon it, so"
3199,CANTO IX,"That all things, as he looked upon them, changed"
3200,CANTO IX,And were not as at first. But grave and slow
3201,CANTO IX,"The larger shade went sauntering to and fro,"
3202,CANTO IX,Humming at first the snatches of some tune
3203,CANTO IX,"That soldiers sing, but falling silent soon."
3204,CANTO IX,
3205,CANTO IX,
3206,CANTO IX,22
3207,CANTO IX,
3208,CANTO IX,Then came steps of dawn. And though they heard
3209,CANTO IX,"No milking cry in the fields, and no cock crew,"
3210,CANTO IX,And out of empty air no twittering bird
3211,CANTO IX,"Sounded from neighbouring hedges, yet they knew."
3212,CANTO IX,"Eastward the hollow blackness paled to blue,"
3213,CANTO IX,"Then blue to white: and in the West the rare,"
3214,CANTO IX,Surviving stars blinked feebler in cold air.
3215,CANTO IX,
3216,CANTO IX,
3217,CANTO IX,23
3218,CANTO IX,
3219,CANTO IX,Far beneath Dymer’s feet the sad half-light
3220,CANTO IX,"Discovering the new landscape oddly came,"
3221,CANTO IX,And forms grown half familiar in the night
3222,CANTO IX,Looked strange again: no distance seemed the same.
3223,CANTO IX,And now he could see clear and call by name
3224,CANTO IX,Valleys and hills and woods. The phantoms all
3225,CANTO IX,"Took shape, and made a world, at morning’s call."
3226,CANTO IX,
3227,CANTO IX,
3228,CANTO IX,24
3229,CANTO IX,
3230,CANTO IX,It was a ruinous land. The ragged stumps
3231,CANTO IX,Of broken trees rose out of endless clay
3232,CANTO IX,Naked of flower and grass: the slobbered humps
3233,CANTO IX,Dividing the dead pools. Against the grey
3234,CANTO IX,A shattered village gaped. But now the day
3235,CANTO IX,"Was very near them and the night was past,"
3236,CANTO IX,And Dymer understood and spoke at last.
3237,CANTO IX,
3238,CANTO IX,
3239,CANTO IX,25
3240,CANTO IX,
3241,CANTO IX,"“Now I have wooed and won you, bridal earth,"
3242,CANTO IX,"Beautiful world that lives, desire of men."
3243,CANTO IX,All that the spirit intended at my birth
3244,CANTO IX,This day shall be born into deed ... and then
3245,CANTO IX,The hard day’s labour comes no more again
3246,CANTO IX,Forever. The pain dies. The longings cease.
3247,CANTO IX,The ship glides under the green arch of peace.
3248,CANTO IX,
3249,CANTO IX,
3250,CANTO IX,26
3251,CANTO IX,
3252,CANTO IX,“Now drink me as the sun drinks up the mist.
3253,CANTO IX,"This is the hour to cease in, at full flood,"
3254,CANTO IX,"That asks no gift from following years--but, hist!"
3255,CANTO IX,Look yonder! At the corner of that wood--
3256,CANTO IX,"Look! Look there where he comes! It shocks the blood,"
3257,CANTO IX,"The first sight, eh? Now, sentinel, stand clear"
3258,CANTO IX,And save yourself. For God’s sake come not near.”
3259,CANTO IX,
3260,CANTO IX,
3261,CANTO IX,27
3262,CANTO IX,
3263,CANTO IX,His full-grown spirit had moved without command
3264,CANTO IX,Or spur of the will. Before he knew he found
3265,CANTO IX,That he was leaping forward spear in hand
3266,CANTO IX,To where that ashen brute wheeled slowly round
3267,CANTO IX,"Nosing, and set its ears towards the sound,"
3268,CANTO IX,"The pale and heavy brute, rough-ridged behind,"
3269,CANTO IX,"And full of eyes, clinking in scaly rind."
3270,CANTO IX,
3271,CANTO IX,
3272,CANTO IX,28
3273,CANTO IX,
3274,CANTO IX,And now ten paces parted them: and here
3275,CANTO IX,"He halted. He thrust forward his left foot,"
3276,CANTO IX,"Poising his straightened arms, and launched the spear,"
3277,CANTO IX,And gloriously it sang. But now the brute
3278,CANTO IX,Lurched forward: and he saw the weapon shoot
3279,CANTO IX,Beyond it and fall quivering on the field.
3280,CANTO IX,Dymer drew out his sword and raised the shield.
3281,CANTO IX,
3282,CANTO IX,
3283,CANTO IX,29
3284,CANTO IX,
3285,CANTO IX,"What now, my friends? You get no more from me"
3286,CANTO IX,Of Dymer. He goes from us. What he felt
3287,CANTO IX,Or saw from henceforth no man knows but he
3288,CANTO IX,Who has himself gone through the jungle belt
3289,CANTO IX,"Of dying, into peace. That angel knelt"
3290,CANTO IX,Far off and watched them close but could not see
3291,CANTO IX,Their battle. All was ended suddenly.
3292,CANTO IX,
3293,CANTO IX,
3294,CANTO IX,30
3295,CANTO IX,
3296,CANTO IX,"A leap--a cry--flurry of steel and claw,"
3297,CANTO IX,"Then silence. As before, the morning light"
3298,CANTO IX,And the same brute crouched yonder; and he saw
3299,CANTO IX,"Under its feet, broken and bent and white,"
3300,CANTO IX,"The ruined limbs of Dymer, killed outright"
3301,CANTO IX,"All in a moment, all his story done."
3302,CANTO IX,... But that same moment came the rising sun;
3303,CANTO IX,
3304,CANTO IX,
3305,CANTO IX,31
3306,CANTO IX,
3307,CANTO IX,"And thirty miles to Westward, the grey cloud"
3308,CANTO IX,Flushed into answering pink. Long shadows streamed
3309,CANTO IX,"From every hill, and the low hanging shroud"
3310,CANTO IX,Of mist along the valleys broke and steamed
3311,CANTO IX,Gold-flecked to heaven. Far off the armour gleamed
3312,CANTO IX,Like glass upon the dead man’s back. But now
3313,CANTO IX,"The sentinel ran forward, hand to brow,"
3314,CANTO IX,
3315,CANTO IX,
3316,CANTO IX,32
3317,CANTO IX,
3318,CANTO IX,And staring. For between him and the sun
3319,CANTO IX,He saw that country clothed with dancing flowers
3320,CANTO IX,Where flower had never grown; and one by one
3321,CANTO IX,"The splintered woods, as if from April showers,"
3322,CANTO IX,Were softening into green. In the leafy towers
3323,CANTO IX,"Rose the cool, sudden chattering on the tongues"
3324,CANTO IX,Of happy birds with morning in their lungs.
3325,CANTO IX,
3326,CANTO IX,
3327,CANTO IX,33
3328,CANTO IX,
3329,CANTO IX,"The wave of flowers came breaking round his feet,"
3330,CANTO IX,"Crocus and bluebell, primrose, daffodil"
3331,CANTO IX,Shivering with moisture: and the air grew sweet
3332,CANTO IX,"Within his nostrils, changing heart and will,"
3333,CANTO IX,"Making him laugh. He looked, and Dymer still"
3334,CANTO IX,Lay dead among the flowers and pinned beneath
3335,CANTO IX,The brute: but as he looked he held his breath;
3336,CANTO IX,
3337,CANTO IX,
3338,CANTO IX,34
3339,CANTO IX,
3340,CANTO IX,For when he had gazed hard with steady eyes
3341,CANTO IX,"Upon the brute, behold, no brute was there,"
3342,CANTO IX,"But someone towering large against the skies,"
3343,CANTO IX,"A wing’d and sworded shape, through whom the air"
3344,CANTO IX,Poured as through glass: and its foam-tumbled hair
3345,CANTO IX,Lay white about the shoulders and the whole
3346,CANTO IX,"Pure body brimmed with life, as a full bowl."
3347,CANTO IX,
3348,CANTO IX,
3349,CANTO IX,35
3350,CANTO IX,
3351,CANTO IX,And from the distant corner of day’s birth
3352,CANTO IX,"He heard clear trumpets blowing and bells ring,"
3353,CANTO IX,A noise of great good coming into earth
3354,CANTO IX,And such a music as the dumb would sing
3355,CANTO IX,If Balder had led back the blameless spring
3356,CANTO IX,"With victory, with the voice of charging spears,"
3357,CANTO IX,And in white lands long-lost Saturnian years.
