322,LYRICAL POEMS,
323,LYRICAL POEMS,Life is a stream

401,LYRICAL POEMS,"It hangs, a piece of wood with colours dim."
402,LYRICAL POEMS,"Once, long ago, it was a waving tree"

406,LYRICAL POEMS,"The spring had swelled its buds with coming flowers,"
407,LYRICAL POEMS,"Summer had run like fire through its veins,"
408,LYRICAL POEMS,"While autumn pelted it with chestnut burrs,"
409,LYRICAL POEMS,And strewed the leafy ground with acorn cups.
410,LYRICAL POEMS,Dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among
411,LYRICAL POEMS,"Its branches, breaking here and there a limb;"
412,LYRICAL POEMS,But every now and then broad sunlit days
413,LYRICAL POEMS,"Lovingly lingered, caught among the leaves."
414,LYRICAL POEMS,"Yes, it had known all this, and yet to us"
415,LYRICAL POEMS,"It does not speak of mossy forest ways,"

429,LYRICAL POEMS,Fall pattering backward to the parent sea.
430,LYRICAL POEMS,"Gliding along the green and foam-flecked hollows,"
431,LYRICAL POEMS,"Or skimming some white crest about to break,"
432,LYRICAL POEMS,The spirits of the sky deigning to stoop
433,LYRICAL POEMS,And play with ocean in a summer mood.
434,LYRICAL POEMS,"Hanging above the high, wide open door,"
435,LYRICAL POEMS,"It brings to us in quiet, firelit room,"
436,LYRICAL POEMS,"The freedom of the earth's vast solitudes,"

457,LYRICAL POEMS,Catches the stars and pulls them down
458,LYRICAL POEMS,To shine on some slumbering Chinese town.
459,LYRICAL POEMS,O Kindly Sun!  Understanding Moon!
460,LYRICAL POEMS,Bring evening to crowd the footsteps of noon.

480,LYRICAL POEMS,With powdered wings.
481,LYRICAL POEMS,
482,LYRICAL POEMS,"Here terrace sinks to terrace, arbors close"
483,LYRICAL POEMS,The ends of dreaming paths; a wanton wind
484,LYRICAL POEMS,"Jostles the half-ripe pears, and then, unkind,"
485,LYRICAL POEMS,"Tumbles a-slumber in a pillar rose,"

487,LYRICAL POEMS,Grown indolent.
488,LYRICAL POEMS,

492,LYRICAL POEMS,"In serried rows I guess the straight, stiff stems"

495,LYRICAL POEMS,

498,LYRICAL POEMS,"And where a sunken basin cuts the lawn,"

530,LYRICAL POEMS,"This path which I long to explore,"
531,LYRICAL POEMS,"And over it dashes a waterfall,"
532,LYRICAL POEMS,And the air is full of the roar
533,LYRICAL POEMS,And the thunderous voice of waters which sweep
534,LYRICAL POEMS,In a silver torrent over some steep.
535,LYRICAL POEMS,
536,LYRICAL POEMS,It clears the path with a mighty bound
537,LYRICAL POEMS,"And tumbles below and away,"
538,LYRICAL POEMS,And the trees and the bushes which grow in the rocks
539,LYRICAL POEMS,Are wet with its jewelled spray;
540,LYRICAL POEMS,"The air is misty and heavy with sound,"
541,LYRICAL POEMS,"And small, wet wildflowers star the ground."
542,LYRICAL POEMS,
543,LYRICAL POEMS,"Oh!  The dampness is very good to smell,"
544,LYRICAL POEMS,"And the path is soft to tread,"
545,LYRICAL POEMS,"And beyond the fall it winds up and on,"
546,LYRICAL POEMS,While little streamlets thread
547,LYRICAL POEMS,Their own meandering way down the hill
548,LYRICAL POEMS,"Each singing its own little song, until"
549,LYRICAL POEMS,
550,LYRICAL POEMS,"I forget that 't is only a pictured path,"

607,LYRICAL POEMS,
608,LYRICAL POEMS,
609,LYRICAL POEMS,The Fool Errant sat by the highway of life
610,LYRICAL POEMS,"And his gaze wandered up and his gaze wandered down,"
611,LYRICAL POEMS,"A vigorous youth, but with no wish to walk,"
612,LYRICAL POEMS,Yet his longing was great for the distant town.
613,LYRICAL POEMS,
614,LYRICAL POEMS,He whistled a little frivolous tune
615,LYRICAL POEMS,"Which he felt to be pulsing with ecstasy,"
616,LYRICAL POEMS,"For he thought that success always followed desire,"
617,LYRICAL POEMS,Such a very superlative fool was he.
618,LYRICAL POEMS,
619,LYRICAL POEMS,"A maiden came by on an ambling mule,"
620,LYRICAL POEMS,"Her gown was rose-red and her kerchief blue,"
621,LYRICAL POEMS,On her lap she carried a basket of eggs.
622,LYRICAL POEMS,"Thought the fool, ""There is certainly room for two."""
623,LYRICAL POEMS,
624,LYRICAL POEMS,So he jauntily swaggered towards the maid
625,LYRICAL POEMS,And put out his hand to the bridle-rein.
626,LYRICAL POEMS,"""My pretty girl,"" quoth the fool, ""take me up,"
627,LYRICAL POEMS,"For to ride with you to the town I am fain."""
628,LYRICAL POEMS,
629,LYRICAL POEMS,But the maiden struck at his upraised arm
630,LYRICAL POEMS,"And pelted him hotly with eggs, a score."
631,LYRICAL POEMS,"The mule, lashed into a fury, ran;"
632,LYRICAL POEMS,The fool went back to his stone and swore.
633,LYRICAL POEMS,
634,LYRICAL POEMS,Then out of the cloud of settling dust
635,LYRICAL POEMS,"The burly form of an abbot appeared,"
636,LYRICAL POEMS,Reading his office he rode to the town.
637,LYRICAL POEMS,"And the fool got up, for his heart was cheered."
638,LYRICAL POEMS,
639,LYRICAL POEMS,"He stood in the midst of the long, white road"
640,LYRICAL POEMS,And swept off his cap till it touched the ground.
641,LYRICAL POEMS,"""Ah, Reverent Sir, well met,"" said the fool,"
642,LYRICAL POEMS,"""A worthier transport never was found."
643,LYRICAL POEMS,
644,LYRICAL POEMS,"""I pray you allow me to mount with you,"
645,LYRICAL POEMS,"Your palfrey seems both sturdy and young."""
646,LYRICAL POEMS,The abbot looked up from the holy book
647,LYRICAL POEMS,"And cried out in anger, ""Hold your tongue!"
648,LYRICAL POEMS,
649,LYRICAL POEMS,"""How dare you obstruct the King's highroad,"
650,LYRICAL POEMS,"You saucy varlet, get out of my way."""
651,LYRICAL POEMS,Then he gave the fool a cut with his whip
652,LYRICAL POEMS,"And leaving him smarting, he rode away."
653,LYRICAL POEMS,
654,LYRICAL POEMS,"The fool was angry, the fool was sore,"
655,LYRICAL POEMS,And he cursed the folly of monks and maids.
656,LYRICAL POEMS,"""If I could but meet with a man,"" sighed the fool,"
657,LYRICAL POEMS,"""For a woman fears, and a friar upbraids."""
658,LYRICAL POEMS,
659,LYRICAL POEMS,Then he saw a flashing of distant steel
660,LYRICAL POEMS,"And the clanking of harness greeted his ears,"
661,LYRICAL POEMS,"And up the road journeyed knights-at-arms,"
662,LYRICAL POEMS,With waving plumes and glittering spears.
663,LYRICAL POEMS,
664,LYRICAL POEMS,"The fool took notice and slowly arose,"
665,LYRICAL POEMS,Not quite so sure was his foolish heart.
666,LYRICAL POEMS,If priests and women would none of him
667,LYRICAL POEMS,Was it likely a knight would take his part?
668,LYRICAL POEMS,
669,LYRICAL POEMS,"They sang as they rode, these lusty boys,"
670,LYRICAL POEMS,"When one chanced to turn toward the highway's side,"
671,LYRICAL POEMS,"""There's a sorry figure of fun,"" jested he,"
672,LYRICAL POEMS,"""Well, Sirrah! move back, there is scarce room to ride."""
673,LYRICAL POEMS,
674,LYRICAL POEMS,"""Good Sirs, Kind Sirs,"" begged the crestfallen fool,"
675,LYRICAL POEMS,"""I pray of your courtesy speech with you,"
676,LYRICAL POEMS,"I'm for yonder town, and have no horse to ride,"
677,LYRICAL POEMS,"Have you never a charger will carry two?"""
678,LYRICAL POEMS,
679,LYRICAL POEMS,Then the company halted and laughed out loud.
680,LYRICAL POEMS,"""Was such a request ever made to a knight?"""
681,LYRICAL POEMS,"""And where are your legs,"" asked one, ""if you start,"
682,LYRICAL POEMS,"You may be inside the town gates to-night."""
683,LYRICAL POEMS,
684,LYRICAL POEMS,"""'T is a lazy fellow, let him alone,"
685,LYRICAL POEMS,"They've no room in the town for such idlers as he."""
686,LYRICAL POEMS,"But one bent from his saddle and said, ""My man,"
687,LYRICAL POEMS,Art thou not ashamed to beg charity!
688,LYRICAL POEMS,
689,LYRICAL POEMS,"""Thou art well set up, and thy legs are strong,"
690,LYRICAL POEMS,But it much misgives me lest thou'rt a fool;
691,LYRICAL POEMS,"For beggars get only a beggar's crust,"
692,LYRICAL POEMS,"Wise men are reared in a different school."""
693,LYRICAL POEMS,
694,LYRICAL POEMS,"Then they clattered away in the dust and the wind,"
695,LYRICAL POEMS,And the fool slunk back to his lonely stone;
696,LYRICAL POEMS,He began to see that the man who asks
697,LYRICAL POEMS,Must likewise give and not ask alone.
698,LYRICAL POEMS,
699,LYRICAL POEMS,"Purple tree-shadows crept over the road,"
700,LYRICAL POEMS,"The level sun flung an orange light,"
701,LYRICAL POEMS,"And the fool laid his head on the hard, gray stone"
702,LYRICAL POEMS,And wept as he realized advancing night.
703,LYRICAL POEMS,
704,LYRICAL POEMS,"A great, round moon rose over a hill"
705,LYRICAL POEMS,And the steady wind blew yet more cool;
706,LYRICAL POEMS,"And crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed,"
707,LYRICAL POEMS,For at last he knew he was only a fool.

717,LYRICAL POEMS,Nodding in chequered sunshine of the trees;
718,LYRICAL POEMS,"A quiet place, still, with the sound of birds,"
719,LYRICAL POEMS,"Where, though unseen, is heard the endless song"
720,LYRICAL POEMS,And murmur of the never resting sea.
721,LYRICAL POEMS,"'T was winter, Roger, when you made this cup,"
722,LYRICAL POEMS,But coming Spring guided your eager hand
723,LYRICAL POEMS,"And round the edge you fashioned young green leaves,"
724,LYRICAL POEMS,A proper chalice made to hold the shy
725,LYRICAL POEMS,And little flowers of the woods.  And here
726,LYRICAL POEMS,"They will forget their sad uprooting, lost"
727,LYRICAL POEMS,In pleasure that this circle of bright leaves
728,LYRICAL POEMS,Should be their setting; once more they will dream

748,LYRICAL POEMS,Starfire lights your heart's blossoming.
749,LYRICAL POEMS,
750,LYRICAL POEMS,"In the intimate dark there's never an ear,"

766,LYRICAL POEMS,"And glowing with a sumptuous splendor, make"

781,LYRICAL POEMS,
782,LYRICAL POEMS,Softly the moon glints and glistens
783,LYRICAL POEMS,"As the water takes and leaves,"
784,LYRICAL POEMS,Like golden ears of corn
785,LYRICAL POEMS,"Which fall from loose-bound sheaves,"
786,LYRICAL POEMS,
787,LYRICAL POEMS,Or like the snow-white petals

791,LYRICAL POEMS,

830,LYRICAL POEMS,"Which spurs them on to any great endeavor,"
831,LYRICAL POEMS,"To them the fields and woods are closest friends,"
832,LYRICAL POEMS,And they hold dear communion with the hills;
833,LYRICAL POEMS,"The voice of waters soothes them with its fall,"
834,LYRICAL POEMS,And the great winds bring healing in their sound.
835,LYRICAL POEMS,To them a city is a prison house
836,LYRICAL POEMS,"Where pent up human forces labour and strive,"
837,LYRICAL POEMS,"Where beauty dwells not, driven forth by man;"
838,LYRICAL POEMS,But where in winter they must live until
839,LYRICAL POEMS,Summer gives back the spaces of the hills.
840,LYRICAL POEMS,To me it is not so.  I love the earth
841,LYRICAL POEMS,And all the gifts of her so lavish hand:
842,LYRICAL POEMS,"Sunshine and flowers, rivers and rushing winds,"
843,LYRICAL POEMS,"Thick branches swaying in a winter storm,"
844,LYRICAL POEMS,And moonlight playing in a boat's wide wake;
845,LYRICAL POEMS,"But more than these, and much, ah, how much more,"
846,LYRICAL POEMS,I love the very human heart of man.
847,LYRICAL POEMS,"Above me spreads the hot, blue mid-day sky,"
848,LYRICAL POEMS,Far down the hillside lies the sleeping lake
849,LYRICAL POEMS,"Lazily reflecting back the sun,"

851,LYRICAL POEMS,Which wanders idly through the nodding ferns.
852,LYRICAL POEMS,"The blue crest of the distant mountain, tops"
853,LYRICAL POEMS,The green crest of the hill on which I sit;
854,LYRICAL POEMS,"And it is summer, glorious, deep-toned summer,"
855,LYRICAL POEMS,The very crown of nature's changing year
856,LYRICAL POEMS,When all her surging life is at its full.
857,LYRICAL POEMS,"To me alone it is a time of pause,"
858,LYRICAL POEMS,"A void and silent space between two worlds,"
859,LYRICAL POEMS,"When inspiration lags, and feeling sleeps,"
860,LYRICAL POEMS,Gathering strength for efforts yet to come.
861,LYRICAL POEMS,"For life alone is creator of life,"
862,LYRICAL POEMS,And closest contact with the human world
863,LYRICAL POEMS,Is like a lantern shining in the night
864,LYRICAL POEMS,To light me to a knowledge of myself.
865,LYRICAL POEMS,I love the vivid life of winter months
866,LYRICAL POEMS,"In constant intercourse with human minds,"
867,LYRICAL POEMS,When every new experience is gain

890,LYRICAL POEMS,"Sweeping triumphant across it, it wound between hedges of roses"
891,LYRICAL POEMS,"Whose blossoms were poised above leaves as pond lilies float on the water,"
892,LYRICAL POEMS,While hidden by bloom in a hawthorn a bird filled the morning with singing.
893,LYRICAL POEMS,
894,LYRICAL POEMS,"It widened a highway, majestic, stretching ever to distant horizons,"
895,LYRICAL POEMS,"Where shadows of tree-branches wavered, vague outlines invaded by sunshine;"
896,LYRICAL POEMS,"No sound but the wind as it whispered the secrets of earth to the flowers,"
897,LYRICAL POEMS,"And the hum of the yellow bees, honey-laden and dusty with pollen."

907,LYRICAL POEMS,"The half-realized beauty of quiet, the sacred unconscious communing."
908,LYRICAL POEMS,"And now he is come to a river, a line of gray, sullen water,"

1366,LYRICAL POEMS,"He stumbled, lurched, and struck against a door"

1372,LYRICAL POEMS,
1373,LYRICAL POEMS,Through travail of ignoble midnight streets
1374,LYRICAL POEMS,He came at last to shelter in a porch
1375,LYRICAL POEMS,Where gothic saints and warriors made a shield
1376,LYRICAL POEMS,"To cover him, and tortured gargoyles spat"
1377,LYRICAL POEMS,One long continuous stream of silver rain

1379,LYRICAL POEMS,"Into a darkness, loud with rushing sound"
1380,LYRICAL POEMS,"Of water falling, gurgling as it fell,"
1381,LYRICAL POEMS,But always thickly dark.  Then as he leaned
1382,LYRICAL POEMS,"Unconscious where, the great oak door blew back"
1383,LYRICAL POEMS,"And cast him, bruised and dripping, in the church."
1384,LYRICAL POEMS,His eyes from long sojourning in the night
1385,LYRICAL POEMS,Were blinded now as by some glorious sun;
1386,LYRICAL POEMS,He slowly crawled toward the altar steps.
1387,LYRICAL POEMS,"He could not think, for heavy in his ears"
1388,LYRICAL POEMS,An organ boomed majestic harmonies;
1389,LYRICAL POEMS,He only knew that what he saw was light!
