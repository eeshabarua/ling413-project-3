53,HENRY TIMROD,"_Long are the days, and three times long the nights."
54,HENRY TIMROD,The weary hours are a heavy chain
55,HENRY TIMROD,"Upon the feet of all Earth's dear delights,"
56,HENRY TIMROD,Holding them ever prisoners to pain.
57,HENRY TIMROD,What shall beguile me to believe again
58,HENRY TIMROD,"In hope, that faith within her parable writes"
59,HENRY TIMROD,"Of life, care reads with eyes whose tear-drops stain?"
60,HENRY TIMROD,Shall such assist me to subdue the heights?
61,HENRY TIMROD,"Long is the night, and over long the day.--"
62,HENRY TIMROD,The burden of all being!--is it worse
63,HENRY TIMROD,"Or better, lo! that they who toil and pray"
64,HENRY TIMROD,May win not more than they who toil and curse?
65,HENRY TIMROD,"A little sleep, a little love, ah me!"
66,HENRY TIMROD,And the slow weigh up the soul's Calvary!_

1866,THE TROGLODYTE,"At the hollow roots of a monster height,--"
1867,THE TROGLODYTE,"That grew from the heart of the world to light,--"
1868,THE TROGLODYTE,I dwelt in caverns: over me
1869,THE TROGLODYTE,Were mountains older than the moon;
1870,THE TROGLODYTE,"And forests vaster than the sea,"
1871,THE TROGLODYTE,"And gulfs, that the earthquake's hand had hewn,"
1872,THE TROGLODYTE,Hung under me. And late and soon
1873,THE TROGLODYTE,I heard the dæmon of change that sighed
1874,THE TROGLODYTE,A cosmic language of mystery;
1875,THE TROGLODYTE,"While life sat silent, primeval-eyed,"
1876,THE TROGLODYTE,With the infant spirit of prophecy.
1877,THE TROGLODYTE,
1878,THE TROGLODYTE,Gaunt stars glared down on the Titan peaks;
1879,THE TROGLODYTE,And the gaunter glare of the cratered streaks
1880,THE TROGLODYTE,Of the sunset's ruin heard condor shrieks.
1881,THE TROGLODYTE,"The roar of cataracts hurled in air,"
1882,THE TROGLODYTE,"And the hurricane laying his thunders bare,"
1883,THE TROGLODYTE,"And rush of battling beasts,--whose lair"
1884,THE TROGLODYTE,"Was the antechamber of nadir-gloom,--"
1885,THE TROGLODYTE,Were my outworld joys. But who shall tell
1886,THE TROGLODYTE,The awe of the depths that heard the boom
1887,THE TROGLODYTE,Of the iron rivers that fashioned Hell!

1899,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,
1900,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,"Far in the night, a rose of light"
1901,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,It shines beside the sea;
1902,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,But overhead an unknown dread
1903,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Impends eternally.
1904,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,
1905,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,"There is a sound above, around"
1906,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Of music by the sea;
1907,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,And weird and wide the torches glide
1908,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Of pagan revelry.
1909,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,
1910,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,There is a noise as of a voice
1911,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,That calls beneath the sea;

1913,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,And vague expectancy.
1914,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,
1915,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Then slowly up--as from a cup
1916,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Seethes poison--lifts the sea;
1917,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,"Wild mass on mass, as in black glass,"
1918,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,The town glows fiery.
1919,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,
1920,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Red-lit it glowers like Hell's dark towers
1921,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Set in the iron sea;
1922,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,And monster swarms with awful forms
1923,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Roll though it cloudily.
1924,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,
1925,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,"Still overhead the unknown dread,"
1926,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,"Whose shadow dyes the sea,"
1927,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,At wrath-winged wait behind its gate
1928,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Till God shall set it free.

1933,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Night settles hideously.

1936,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,"Red in the vasty sea,"

1938,THE CITY OF DARKNESS,Sits in immensity.
