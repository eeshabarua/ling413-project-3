115,V,Renascence
116,V,
117,V,
118,V,All I could see from where I stood
119,V,Was three long mountains and a wood;
120,V,"I turned and looked another way,"
121,V,And saw three islands in a bay.
122,V,So with my eyes I traced the line
123,V,"Of the horizon, thin and fine,"
124,V,Straight around till I was come
125,V,Back to where I'd started from;
126,V,And all I saw from where I stood
127,V,Was three long mountains and a wood.
128,V,Over these things I could not see;
129,V,These were the things that bounded me;
130,V,"And I could touch them with my hand,"
131,V,"Almost, I thought, from where I stand."
132,V,And all at once things seemed so small
133,V,"My breath came short, and scarce at all."
134,V,"But, sure, the sky is big, I said;"
135,V,Miles and miles above my head;
136,V,So here upon my back I'll lie
137,V,And look my fill into the sky.
138,V,"And so I looked, and, after all,"
139,V,The sky was not so very tall.
140,V,"The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,"
141,V,And--sure enough!--I see the top!
142,V,"The sky, I thought, is not so grand;"
143,V,I 'most could touch it with my hand!
144,V,"And reaching up my hand to try,"
145,V,I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
146,V,"I screamed, and--lo!--Infinity"
147,V,Came down and settled over me;
148,V,"Forced back my scream into my chest,"
149,V,"Bent back my arm upon my breast,"
150,V,"And, pressing of the Undefined"
151,V,"The definition on my mind,"
152,V,Held up before my eyes a glass
153,V,Through which my shrinking sight did pass
154,V,Until it seemed I must behold
155,V,Immensity made manifold;
156,V,Whispered to me a word whose sound
157,V,"Deafened the air for worlds around,"
158,V,And brought unmuffled to my ears
159,V,"The gossiping of friendly spheres,"
160,V,"The creaking of the tented sky,"
161,V,The ticking of Eternity.
162,V,"I saw and heard, and knew at last"
163,V,"The How and Why of all things, past,"
164,V,"And present, and forevermore."
165,V,"The Universe, cleft to the core,"
166,V,Lay open to my probing sense
167,V,"That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence"
168,V,"But could not,--nay! But needs must suck"
169,V,"At the great wound, and could not pluck"
170,V,My lips away till I had drawn
171,V,"All venom out.--Ah, fearful pawn!"
172,V,For my omniscience paid I toll
173,V,In infinite remorse of soul.
174,V,"All sin was of my sinning, all"
175,V,"Atoning mine, and mine the gall"
176,V,Of all regret. Mine was the weight
177,V,"Of every brooded wrong, the hate"
178,V,"That stood behind each envious thrust,"
179,V,"Mine every greed, mine every lust."
180,V,"And all the while for every grief,"
181,V,"Each suffering, I craved relief"
182,V,"With individual desire,--"
183,V,Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire
184,V,About a thousand people crawl;
185,V,"Perished with each,--then mourned for all!"
186,V,A man was starving in Capri;
187,V,He moved his eyes and looked at me;
188,V,"I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,"
189,V,And knew his hunger as my own.
190,V,I saw at sea a great fog bank
191,V,Between two ships that struck and sank;
192,V,A thousand screams the heavens smote;
193,V,And every scream tore through my throat.
194,V,"No hurt I did not feel, no death"
195,V,That was not mine; mine each last breath
196,V,"That, crying, met an answering cry"
197,V,From the compassion that was I.
198,V,"All suffering mine, and mine its rod;"
199,V,"Mine, pity like the pity of God."
200,V,"Ah, awful weight!  Infinity"
201,V,Pressed down upon the finite Me!
202,V,"My anguished spirit, like a bird,"
203,V,Beating against my lips I heard;
204,V,Yet lay the weight so close about
205,V,There was no room for it without.
206,V,And so beneath the weight lay I
207,V,"And suffered death, but could not die."
208,V,
209,V,"Long had I lain thus, craving death,"
210,V,When quietly the earth beneath
211,V,"Gave way, and inch by inch, so great"
212,V,"At last had grown the crushing weight,"
213,V,Into the earth I sank till I
214,V,"Full six feet under ground did lie,"
215,V,"And sank no more,--there is no weight"
216,V,"Can follow here, however great."
217,V,"From off my breast I felt it roll,"
218,V,And as it went my tortured soul
219,V,Burst forth and fled in such a gust
220,V,That all about me swirled the dust.
221,V,
222,V,Deep in the earth I rested now;
223,V,Cool is its hand upon the brow
224,V,And soft its breast beneath the head
225,V,Of one who is so gladly dead.
226,V,"And all at once, and over all"
227,V,The pitying rain began to fall;
228,V,I lay and heard each pattering hoof
229,V,"Upon my lowly, thatched roof,"
230,V,And seemed to love the sound far more
231,V,Than ever I had done before.
232,V,For rain it hath a friendly sound
233,V,To one who's six feet underground;
234,V,And scarce the friendly voice or face:
235,V,A grave is such a quiet place.
236,V,
237,V,"The rain, I said, is kind to come"
238,V,And speak to me in my new home.
239,V,I would I were alive again
240,V,"To kiss the fingers of the rain,"
241,V,To drink into my eyes the shine
242,V,"Of every slanting silver line,"
243,V,"To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze"
244,V,From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
245,V,"For soon the shower will be done,"
246,V,And then the broad face of the sun
247,V,Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
248,V,Until the world with answering mirth
249,V,"Shakes joyously, and each round drop"
250,V,"Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top."
251,V,"How can I bear it; buried here,"
252,V,While overhead the sky grows clear
253,V,And blue again after the storm?
254,V,"O, multi-colored, multiform,"
255,V,"Beloved beauty over me,"
256,V,"That I shall never, never see"
257,V,"Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,"
258,V,That I shall never more behold!
259,V,"Sleeping your myriad magics through,"
260,V,Close-sepulchred away from you!
261,V,"O God, I cried, give me new birth,"
262,V,And put me back upon the earth!
263,V,Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd
264,V,"And let the heavy rain, down-poured"
265,V,"In one big torrent, set me free,"
266,V,Washing my grave away from me!
267,V,
268,V,I ceased; and through the breathless hush
269,V,"That answered me, the far-off rush"
270,V,Of herald wings came whispering
271,V,Like music down the vibrant string
272,V,"Of my ascending prayer, and--crash!"
273,V,Before the wild wind's whistling lash
274,V,The startled storm-clouds reared on high
275,V,"And plunged in terror down the sky,"
276,V,And the big rain in one black wave
277,V,Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
278,V,I know not how such things can be;
279,V,I only know there came to me
280,V,A fragrance such as never clings
281,V,To aught save happy living things;
282,V,A sound as of some joyous elf
283,V,"Singing sweet songs to please himself,"
284,V,"And, through and over everything,"
285,V,A sense of glad awakening.
286,V,"The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,"
287,V,Whispering to me I could hear;
288,V,I felt the rain's cool finger-tips
289,V,"Brushed tenderly across my lips,"
290,V,"Laid gently on my sealed sight,"
291,V,And all at once the heavy night
292,V,"Fell from my eyes and I could see,--"
293,V,"A drenched and dripping apple-tree,"
294,V,"A last long line of silver rain,"
295,V,A sky grown clear and blue again.
296,V,And as I looked a quickening gust
297,V,Of wind blew up to me and thrust
298,V,Into my face a miracle
299,V,"Of orchard-breath, and with the smell,--"
300,V,I know not how such things can be!--
301,V,I breathed my soul back into me.
302,V,Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I
303,V,And hailed the earth with such a cry
304,V,As is not heard save from a man
305,V,"Who has been dead, and lives again."
306,V,About the trees my arms I wound;
307,V,Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
308,V,I raised my quivering arms on high;
309,V,"I laughed and laughed into the sky,"
310,V,Till at my throat a strangling sob
311,V,"Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb"
312,V,Sent instant tears into my eyes;
313,V,"O God, I cried, no dark disguise"
314,V,Can e'er hereafter hide from me
315,V,Thy radiant identity!
316,V,Thou canst not move across the grass
317,V,"But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,"
318,V,"Nor speak, however silently,"
319,V,But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
320,V,I know the path that tells Thy way
321,V,Through the cool eve of every day;
322,V,"God, I can push the grass apart"
323,V,And lay my finger on Thy heart!
324,V,
325,V,The world stands out on either side
326,V,No wider than the heart is wide;
327,V,"Above the world is stretched the sky,--"
328,V,No higher than the soul is high.
329,V,The heart can push the sea and land
330,V,Farther away on either hand;
331,V,"The soul can split the sky in two,"
332,V,And let the face of God shine through.
333,V,But East and West will pinch the heart
334,V,That can not keep them pushed apart;
335,V,And he whose soul is flat--the sky
336,V,Will cave in on him by and by.
337,V,
338,V,
339,V,
340,V,
341,V,Interim
342,V,
343,V,
344,V,The room is full of you!--As I came in
345,V,"And closed the door behind me, all at once"
346,V,"A something in the air, intangible,"
347,V,"Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick!--"
348,V,
349,V,"Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed"
350,V,Each other room's dear personality.
351,V,"The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers,--"
352,V,"The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death--"
353,V,Has strangled that habitual breath of home
354,V,Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;
355,V,And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.
356,V,Save here.  Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate
357,V,"Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped"
358,V,"Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,"
359,V,Sweet garden of a thousand years ago
360,V,"And suddenly thought, ""I have been here before!"""
361,V,
362,V,"You are not here.  I know that you are gone,"
363,V,And will not ever enter here again.
364,V,"And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,"
365,V,Your silent step must wake across the hall;
366,V,"If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes"
367,V,Would kiss me from the door.--So short a time
368,V,To teach my life its transposition to
369,V,This difficult and unaccustomed key!--
370,V,The room is as you left it; your last touch--
371,V,"A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself"
372,V,As saintly--hallows now each simple thing;
373,V,"Hallows and glorifies, and glows between"
374,V,The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.
375,V,
376,V,"There is your book, just as you laid it down,"
377,V,"Face to the table,--I cannot believe"
378,V,That you are gone!--Just then it seemed to me
379,V,You must be here.  I almost laughed to think
380,V,How like reality the dream had been;
381,V,"Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still."
382,V,"That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!"
383,V,"Perhaps you thought, ""I wonder what comes next,"
384,V,"And whether this or this will be the end"";"
385,V,"So rose, and left it, thinking to return."
386,V,
387,V,"Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed"
388,V,"Out of the room, rocked silently a while"
389,V,Ere it again was still. When you were gone
390,V,"Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,"
391,V,"Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,"
392,V,"Silently, to and fro. . ."
393,V,
394,V,"And here are the last words your fingers wrote,"
395,V,Scrawled in broad characters across a page
396,V,"In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,"
397,V,"Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down."
398,V,"Here with a looping knot you crossed a ""t"","
399,V,"And here another like it, just beyond"
400,V,"These two eccentric ""e's"".  You were so small,"
401,V,And wrote so brave a hand!
402,V,How strange it seems
403,V,That of all words these are the words you chose!
404,V,And yet a simple choice; you did not know
405,V,You would not write again.  If you had known--
406,V,"But then, it does not matter,--and indeed"
407,V,If you had known there was so little time
408,V,You would have dropped your pen and come to me
409,V,"And this page would be empty, and some phrase"
410,V,Other than this would hold my wonder now.
411,V,"Yet, since you could not know, and it befell"
412,V,"That these are the last words your fingers wrote,"
413,V,There is a dignity some might not see
414,V,"In this, ""I picked the first sweet-pea to-day."""
415,V,To-day!  Was there an opening bud beside it
416,V,"You left until to-morrow?--O my love,"
417,V,"The things that withered,--and you came not back!"
418,V,That day you filled this circle of my arms
419,V,That now is empty.  (O my empty life!)
420,V,"That day--that day you picked the first sweet-pea,--"
421,V,And brought it in to show me!  I recall
422,V,With terrible distinctness how the smell
423,V,Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.
424,V,"I know, you held it up for me to see"
425,V,"And flushed because I looked not at the flower,"
426,V,But at your face; and when behind my look
427,V,You saw such unmistakable intent
428,V,You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.
429,V,"(You were the fairest thing God ever made,"
430,V,I think.)  And then your hands above my heart
431,V,"Drew down its stem into a fastening,"
432,V,And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.
433,V,I wonder if you knew.  (Beloved hands!
434,V,Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.
435,V,Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust
436,V,In your bright hair.)  What is the need of Heaven
437,V,When earth can be so sweet?--If only God
438,V,"Had let us love,--and show the world the way!"
439,V,Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books
440,V,When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!
441,V,That first sweet-pea!  I wonder where it is.
442,V,"It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,"
443,V,"And yet,--I am not sure. I am not sure,"
444,V,"Even, if it was white or pink; for then"
445,V,"'Twas much like any other flower to me,"
446,V,"Save that it was the first.  I did not know,"
447,V,"Then, that it was the last.  If I had known--"
448,V,"But then, it does not matter.  Strange how few,"
449,V,"After all's said and done, the things that are"
450,V,Of moment.
451,V,Few indeed!  When I can make
452,V,Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!
453,V,"""I had you and I have you now no more."""
454,V,"There, there it dangles,--where's the little truth"
455,V,That can for long keep footing under that
456,V,When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?
457,V,"Here, let me write it down!  I wish to see"
458,V,Just how a thing like that will look on paper!
459,V,
460,V,"""*I had you and I have you now no more*."""
461,V,
462,V,"O little words, how can you run so straight"
463,V,"Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?"
464,V,"How can you fall apart, whom such a theme"
465,V,"Has bound together, and hereafter aid"
466,V,"In trivial expression, that have been"
467,V,So hideously dignified?--Would God
468,V,That tearing you apart would tear the thread
469,V,"I strung you on!  Would God--O God, my mind"
470,V,Stretches asunder on this merciless rack
471,V,"Of imagery!  O, let me sleep a while!"
472,V,"Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back"
473,V,In that sweet summer afternoon with you.
474,V,Summer?  'Tis summer still by the calendar!
475,V,"How easily could God, if He so willed,"
476,V,Set back the world a little turn or two!
477,V,"Correct its griefs, and bring its joys again!"
478,V,
479,V,We were so wholly one I had not thought
480,V,That we could die apart.  I had not thought
481,V,"That I could move,--and you be stiff and still!"
482,V,"That I could speak,--and you perforce be dumb!"
483,V,"I think our heart-strings were, like warp and woof"
484,V,"In some firm fabric, woven in and out;"
485,V,Your golden filaments in fair design
486,V,Across my duller fibre.  And to-day
487,V,The shining strip is rent; the exquisite
488,V,Fine pattern is destroyed; part of your heart
489,V,Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled
490,V,In the damp earth with you.  I have been torn
491,V,"In two, and suffer for the rest of me."
492,V,What is my life to me?  And what am I
493,V,"To life,--a ship whose star has guttered out?"
494,V,A Fear that in the deep night starts awake
495,V,"Perpetually, to find its senses strained"
496,V,"Against the taut strings of the quivering air,"
497,V,Awaiting the return of some dread chord?
498,V,
499,V,"Dark, Dark, is all I find for metaphor;"
500,V,"All else were contrast,--save that contrast's wall"
501,V,"Is down, and all opposed things flow together"
502,V,"Into a vast monotony, where night"
503,V,"And day, and frost and thaw, and death and life,"
504,V,Are synonyms.  What now--what now to me
505,V,Are all the jabbering birds and foolish flowers
506,V,That clutter up the world?  You were my song!
507,V,"Now, let discord scream!  You were my flower!"
508,V,Now let the world grow weeds!  For I shall not
509,V,Plant things above your grave--(the common balm
510,V,Of the conventional woe for its own wound!)
511,V,Amid sensations rendered negative
512,V,"By your elimination stands to-day,"
513,V,"Certain, unmixed, the element of grief;"
514,V,I sorrow; and I shall not mock my truth
515,V,"With travesties of suffering, nor seek"
516,V,To effigy its incorporeal bulk
517,V,In little wry-faced images of woe.
518,V,
519,V,I cannot call you back; and I desire
520,V,No utterance of my immaterial voice.
521,V,I cannot even turn my face this way
522,V,"Or that, and say, ""My face is turned to you"";"
523,V,"I know not where you are, I do not know"
524,V,"If Heaven hold you or if earth transmute,"
525,V,"Body and soul, you into earth again;"
526,V,But this I know:--not for one second's space
527,V,Shall I insult my sight with visionings
528,V,Such as the credulous crowd so eager-eyed
529,V,"Beholds, self-conjured, in the empty air."
530,V,Let the world wail!  Let drip its easy tears!
531,V,My sorrow shall be dumb!
532,V,
533,V,--What do I say?
534,V,God! God!--God pity me!  Am I gone mad
535,V,That I should spit upon a rosary?
536,V,Am I become so shrunken?  Would to God
537,V,I too might feel that frenzied faith whose touch
538,V,Makes temporal the most enduring grief;
539,V,"Though it must walk a while, as is its wont,"
540,V,With wild lamenting!  Would I too might weep
541,V,Where weeps the world and hangs its piteous wreaths
542,V,"For its new dead!  Not Truth, but Faith, it is"
543,V,That keeps the world alive.  If all at once
544,V,"Faith were to slacken,--that unconscious faith"
545,V,"Which must, I know, yet be the corner-stone"
546,V,"Of all believing,--birds now flying fearless"
547,V,Across would drop in terror to the earth;
548,V,Fishes would drown; and the all-governing reins
549,V,Would tangle in the frantic hands of God
550,V,And the worlds gallop headlong to destruction!
551,V,
552,V,"O God, I see it now, and my sick brain"
553,V,Staggers and swoons!  How often over me
554,V,Flashes this breathlessness of sudden sight
555,V,In which I see the universe unrolled
556,V,Before me like a scroll and read thereon
557,V,"Chaos and Doom, where helpless planets whirl"
558,V,"Dizzily round and round and round and round,"
559,V,"Like tops across a table, gathering speed"
560,V,"With every spin, to waver on the edge"
561,V,One instant--looking over--and the next
562,V,To shudder and lurch forward out of sight--
563,V,
564,V,*    *    *    *    *
565,V,
566,V,"Ah, I am worn out--I am wearied out--"
567,V,"It is too much--I am but flesh and blood,"
568,V,"And I must sleep.  Though you were dead again,"
569,V,I am but flesh and blood and I must sleep.

578,V,"Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!"
579,V,"And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,"
580,V,I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly
581,V,"That I might eat again, and met thy sneers"
582,V,"With deprecations, and thy blows with tears,--"
583,V,"Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,"
584,V,As if spent passion were a holiday!
585,V,"And now I go.  Nor threat, nor easy vow"
586,V,Of tardy kindness can avail thee now
587,V,"With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;"
588,V,"Lonely I came, and I depart alone,"
589,V,And know not where nor unto whom I go;
590,V,"But that thou canst not follow me I know."""
591,V,
592,V,"Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain"
593,V,"My thought ran still, until I spake again:"
594,V,
595,V,"""Ah, but I go not as I came,--no trace"
596,V,Is mine to bear away of that old grace
597,V,"I brought!  I have been heated in thy fires,"
598,V,"Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,"
599,V,Thy mark is on me!  I am not the same
600,V,"Nor ever more shall be, as when I came."
601,V,Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.
602,V,"In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed"
603,V,"Is wakeful for alarm,--oh, shame to thee,"
604,V,"For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,"
605,V,Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing!
606,V,"Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing"
607,V,To have about the house when I was grown
608,V,If thou hadst left my little joys alone!
609,V,I asked of thee no favor save this one:
610,V,That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!
611,V,"And this thou didst deny, calling my name"
612,V,"Insistently, until I rose and came."
613,V,I saw the sun no more.--It were not well
614,V,"So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,"
615,V,Need I arise to-morrow and renew
616,V,"Again my hated tasks, but I am through"
617,V,"With all things save my thoughts and this one night,"
618,V,So that in truth I seem already quite
619,V,"Free and remote from thee,--I feel no haste"
620,V,And no reluctance to depart; I taste
621,V,"Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,"
622,V,"That in a little while I shall have quaffed."""
623,V,
624,V,"Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,"
625,V,Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed
626,V,Before me one by one till once again
627,V,I set new words unto an old refrain:
628,V,
629,V,"""Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!"
630,V,Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine
631,V,"Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown"
632,V,Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!
633,V,And I have waited well for thee to show
634,V,"If any share were mine,--and now I go!"
635,V,"Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain"
636,V,"I shall but come into mine own again!"""
637,V,"Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,"
638,V,"But turning, straightway, sought a certain door"
639,V,"In the rear wall.  Heavy it was, and low"
640,V,"And dark,--a way by which none e'er would go"
641,V,"That other exit had, and never knock"
642,V,"Was heard thereat,--bearing a curious lock"
643,V,"Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,"
644,V,"Whereof Life held content the useless key,"
645,V,"And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,"
646,V,"Whose sudden voice across a silence must,"
647,V,"I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear,--"
648,V,"A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.--So near"
649,V,I came I felt upon my feet the chill
650,V,Of acid wind creeping across the sill.
651,V,"So stood longtime, till over me at last"
652,V,"Came weariness, and all things other passed"
653,V,To make it room; the still night drifted deep
654,V,"Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep."
655,V,
656,V,"But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,"
657,V,Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!
658,V,"Startled, I raised my head,--and with a shout"
659,V,"Laid hold upon the latch,--and was without."
660,V,
661,V,*    *    *    *    *
662,V,
663,V,"Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,"
664,V,"Leading me back unto my old abode,"
665,V,"My father's house!  There in the night I came,"
666,V,"And found them feasting, and all things the same"
667,V,As they had been before.  A splendour hung
668,V,"Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung"
669,V,"As, echoing out of very long ago,"
670,V,"Had called me from the house of Life, I know."
671,V,So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame
672,V,On the unlovely garb in which I came;
673,V,Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:
674,V,"""It is my father's house!"" I said and knocked;"
675,V,And the door opened.  To the shining crowd
676,V,"Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,"
677,V,"Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,"
678,V,"And ""Father!"" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept."
679,V,"Ah, days of joy that followed!  All alone"
680,V,"I wandered through the house.  My own, my own,"
681,V,"My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,"
682,V,All I had lacked so long and loved so well!
683,V,"None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,"
684,V,Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.
685,V,
686,V,I know not when the wonder came to me
687,V,"Of what my father's business might be,"
688,V,And whither fared and on what errands bent
689,V,The tall and gracious messengers he sent.
690,V,Yet one day with no song from dawn till night
691,V,"Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight."
692,V,And the next day I called; and on the third
693,V,"Asked them if I might go,--but no one heard."
694,V,"Then, sick with longing, I arose at last"
695,V,"And went unto my father,--in that vast"
696,V,Chamber wherein he for so many years
697,V,"Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres."
698,V,"""Father,"" I said, ""Father, I cannot play"
699,V,"The harp that thou didst give me, and all day"
700,V,"I sit in idleness, while to and fro"
701,V,"About me thy serene, grave servants go;"
702,V,And I am weary of my lonely ease.
703,V,Better a perilous journey overseas
704,V,"Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,"
705,V,To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed
706,V,"That grows to naught,--I love thee more than they"
707,V,Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.
708,V,"Father, I beg of thee a little task"
709,V,"To dignify my days,--'tis all I ask"
710,V,"Forever, but forever, this denied,"
711,V,"I perish."""
712,V,"""Child,"" my father's voice replied,"
713,V,"""All things thy fancy hath desired of me"
714,V,Thou hast received.  I have prepared for thee
715,V,"Within my house a spacious chamber, where"
716,V,"Are delicate things to handle and to wear,"
717,V,And all these things are thine.  Dost thou love song?
718,V,My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.
719,V,Or sigh for flowers?  My fairest gardens stand
720,V,Open as fields to thee on every hand.
721,V,And all thy days this word shall hold the same:
722,V,No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.
723,V,"But as for tasks--"" he smiled, and shook his head;"

739,V,
740,V,
741,V,"Long have I known a glory in it all,"
742,V,But never knew I this;
743,V,Here such a passion is
744,V,"As stretcheth me apart,--Lord, I do fear"
745,V,Thou'st made the world too beautiful this year;

758,V,And not pick one.
759,V,
760,V,I will look at cliffs and clouds
761,V,"With quiet eyes,"
762,V,"Watch the wind bow down the grass,"
763,V,And the grass rise.
764,V,
765,V,And when lights begin to show
766,V,"Up from the town,"
767,V,"I will mark which must be mine,"

779,V,Dawn will find them still again;
780,V,"This has neither wax nor wane,"
781,V,Neither stop nor start.
782,V,
783,V,People dress and go to town;
784,V,I sit in my chair.
785,V,All my thoughts are slow and brown:
786,V,Standing up or sitting down
787,V,"Little matters, or what gown"
788,V,Or what shoes I wear.

798,V,Wherein all grey-eyed people
799,V,May set them down and rest.
800,V,
801,V,"There shall be plates a-plenty,"
802,V,And mugs to melt the chill
803,V,Of all the grey-eyed people
804,V,Who happen up the hill.
805,V,
806,V,"There sound will sleep the traveller,"
807,V,"And dream his journey's end,"
808,V,But I will rouse at midnight
809,V,The falling fire to tend.
810,V,
811,V,"Aye, 'tis a curious fancy--"

825,V,Would that it were day again!--with twilight near!
826,V,
827,V,Love has gone and left me and I don't know what to do;
828,V,This or that or what you will is all the same to me;
829,V,"But all the things that I begin I leave before I'm through,--"
830,V,There's little use in anything as far as I can see.
831,V,
832,V,"Love has gone and left me,--and the neighbors knock and borrow,"
833,V,"And life goes on forever like the gnawing of a mouse,--"
834,V,And to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow
835,V,There's this little street and this little house.

841,V,
842,V,
843,V,I knew her for a little ghost
844,V,That in my garden walked;
845,V,The wall is high--higher than most--
846,V,And the green gate was locked.
847,V,
848,V,And yet I did not think of that
849,V,Till after she was gone--
850,V,"I knew her by the broad white hat,"
851,V,"All ruffled, she had on."
852,V,
853,V,"By the dear ruffles round her feet,"
854,V,By her small hands that hung
855,V,"In their lace mitts, austere and sweet,"
856,V,Her gown's white folds among.
857,V,
858,V,"I watched to see if she would stay,"
859,V,What she would do--and oh!
860,V,She looked as if she liked the way
861,V,I let my garden grow!
862,V,
863,V,She bent above my favourite mint
864,V,"With conscious garden grace,"
865,V,She smiled and smiled--there was no hint
866,V,Of sadness in her face.
867,V,
868,V,She held her gown on either side
869,V,"To let her slippers show,"
870,V,"And up the walk she went with pride,"
871,V,The way great ladies go.
872,V,
873,V,And where the wall is built in new
874,V,And is of ivy bare
875,V,She paused--then opened and passed through
876,V,A gate that once was there.

887,V,"Neither loud nor soft,"
888,V,"But as long accustomed,"
889,V,Under Sorrow's hand?
890,V,Marigolds around the step
891,V,"And rosemary stand,"
892,V,And then comes Sorrow--
893,V,And what does Sorrow care
894,V,For the rosemary
895,V,Or the marigolds there?
896,V,Am I kin to Sorrow?
897,V,Are we kin?
898,V,That so oft upon my door--

989,III,"Over the floor, and somewhere, somewhere,"

991,III,
992,III,"Swung in the wind,--and no wind blowing!--"

1024,III,And she never will be all mine;
1025,III,"She learned her hands in a fairy-tale,"
1026,III,And her mouth on a valentine.
1027,III,
1028,III,She has more hair than she needs;
1029,III,In the sun 'tis a woe to me!
1030,III,"And her voice is a string of colored beads,"
1031,III,Or steps leading into the sea.
1032,III,
1033,III,"She loves me all that she can,"
1034,III,And her ways to my ways resign;
1035,III,"But she was not made for any man,"
1036,III,And she never will be all mine.

1044,III,Hard seeds of hate I planted
1045,III,"That should by now be grown,--"
1046,III,"Rough stalks, and from thick stamens"
1047,III,"A poisonous pollen blown,"
1048,III,"And odors rank, unbreathable,"
1049,III,From dark corollas thrown!
1050,III,
1051,III,At dawn from my damp garden
1052,III,I shook the chilly dew;
1053,III,The thin boughs locked behind me
1054,III,That sprang to let me through;
1055,III,"The blossoms slept,--I sought a place"
1056,III,Where nothing lovely grew.
1057,III,
1058,III,"And there, when day was breaking,"
1059,III,I knelt and looked around:
1060,III,"The light was near, the silence"
1061,III,Was palpitant with sound;
1062,III,I drew my hate from out my breast
1063,III,And thrust it in the ground.
1064,III,
1065,III,"Oh, ye so fiercely tended,"
1066,III,Ye little seeds of hate!
1067,III,I bent above your growing
1068,III,"Early and noon and late,"
1069,III,"Yet are ye drooped and pitiful,--"
1070,III,I cannot rear ye straight!
1071,III,
1072,III,"The sun seeks out my garden,"
1073,III,"No nook is left in shade,"
1074,III,No mist nor mold nor mildew
1075,III,"Endures on any blade,"
1076,III,Sweet rain slants under every bough:
1077,III,"Ye falter, and ye fade."

1084,III,
1085,III,I cannot but remember
1086,III,When the year grows old--
1087,III,October--November--
1088,III,How she disliked the cold!
1089,III,
1090,III,She used to watch the swallows
1091,III,"Go down across the sky,"
1092,III,And turn from the window
1093,III,With a little sharp sigh.
1094,III,
1095,III,And often when the brown leaves
1096,III,"Were brittle on the ground,"
1097,III,And the wind in the chimney
1098,III,"Made a melancholy sound,"
1099,III,
1100,III,She had a look about her
1101,III,That I wish I could forget--
1102,III,The look of a scared thing
1103,III,Sitting in a net!
1104,III,
1105,III,"Oh, beautiful at nightfall"
1106,III,The soft spitting snow!
1107,III,And beautiful the bare boughs
1108,III,Rubbing to and fro!
1109,III,
1110,III,"But the roaring of the fire,"
1111,III,"And the warmth of fur,"
1112,III,And the boiling of the kettle
1113,III,Were beautiful to her!
1114,III,
1115,III,I cannot but remember
1116,III,When the year grows old--
1117,III,October--November--
1118,III,How she disliked the cold!

1131,I,"Thy beauty; though I bend before thee, though"
1132,I,"From left to right, not knowing where to go,"
1133,I,"I turn my troubled eyes, nor here nor there"
1134,I,"Find any refuge from thee, yet I swear"
1135,I,"So has it been with mist,--with moonlight so."
1136,I,
1137,I,Like him who day by day unto his draught
1138,I,Of delicate poison adds him one drop more
1139,I,"Till he may drink unharmed the death of ten,"
1140,I,"Even so, inured to beauty, who have quaffed"
1141,I,"Each hour more deeply than the hour before,"
1142,I,I drink--and live--what has destroyed some men.

1147,II,Time does not bring relief; you all have lied
1148,II,Who told me time would ease me of my pain!
1149,II,I miss him in the weeping of the rain;
1150,II,I want him at the shrinking of the tide;
1151,II,"The old snows melt from every mountain-side,"
1152,II,And last year's leaves are smoke in every lane;
1153,II,But last year's bitter loving must remain
1154,II,"Heaped on my heart, and my old thoughts abide!"
1155,II,
1156,II,There are a hundred places where I fear
1157,II,"To go,--so with his memory they brim!"
1158,II,And entering with relief some quiet place
1159,II,Where never fell his foot or shone his face
1160,II,"I say, ""There is no memory of him here!"""

1168,III,"And dusty roads, and thistles, and the slow"
1169,III,"Rising of the round moon, all throats that sing"
1170,III,"The summer through, and each departing wing,"
1171,III,"And all the nests that the bared branches show,"
1172,III,"And all winds that in any weather blow,"
1173,III,And all the storms that the four seasons bring.
1174,III,
1175,III,You go no more on your exultant feet
1176,III,"Up paths that only mist and morning knew,"
1177,III,"Or watch the wind, or listen to the beat"
1178,III,"Of a bird's wings too high in air to view,--"
1179,III,But you were something more than young and sweet

1189,IV,"I have not seen, through alien grief and mirth;"

1191,IV,"Who in so many rooms first saw the light,"
1192,IV,"Child of all mothers, native of the earth."
1193,IV,
1194,IV,So is no warmth for me at any fire
1195,IV,"To-day, when the world's fire has burned so low;"
1196,IV,"I kneel, spending my breath in vain desire,"
1197,IV,"At that cold hearth which one time roared so strong,"
1198,IV,"And straighten back in weariness, and long"
