103,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE
104,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
105,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
106,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"A little white snowflake that lived in the sky,"
107,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Kept looking down here with a tear in its eye;
108,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And wherever it looked, alas, it could see"
109,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"The ground was as bare, and as brown, as could be;"
110,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And out of the windows, the children’s bright eyes"
111,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Looked wistfully up, at the gray winter skies,"
112,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"While one little fellow was crying outright,"
113,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Because the white snowflakes were nowhere in sight,"
114,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And how could Santa come
115,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"In his reindeer sleigh,"
116,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And Christmas now only
117,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Just two days away?
118,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
119,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
120,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
121,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"It happened just then, that there came dancing by,"
122,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Two lovely large flakes from somewhere in the sky,"
123,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And the little flake cried, “Oh, beautiful flakes,"
124,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"I’ve been here looking down, till my very heart aches;"
125,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"See how dismal it looks, down there on the earth."
126,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Instead of gay laughter, and shouting, and mirth,"
127,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"The children are crying, their bright eyes are wet,"
128,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,For thinking the snowflakes are going to forget.
129,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Will you go down with me sometime before night?
130,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"The children would see us, and laugh with delight.”"
131,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,“Why you dear little flake
132,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Now just dry your eye,”"
133,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Said the lovely white flakes,"
134,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,“We’ll go down by and by.
135,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Just now, we would rather"
136,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Whirl ’round in the air,"
137,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Than to settle ourselves
138,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Away off down there!”
139,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"“And just think,” said one, “of my pretty new gown,"
140,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Being stepped on, and spoiled, and all trodden down!”"
141,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Then gaily enough they were dancing away,"
142,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"When the brave little flake found courage to say,"
143,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
144,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
145,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
146,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,“There’s a beautiful
147,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Story, so I’ve been told,"
148,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Very sweet, and tender,"
149,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And true, and old,"
150,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"About a star,"
151,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
152,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And the wonderful birth,"
153,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Long ago, of a Christ-Child"
154,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,On the earth;
155,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And now, every year"
156,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,At a certain time
157,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
158,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The bells everywhere
159,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Ring out their chime,"
160,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And children gather
161,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"From near and from far,"
162,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,To sing of that wonderful
163,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Child, and the Star."
164,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
165,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And oh, beautiful flakes,"
166,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The time now draws near;
167,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"But alas, see the earth,"
168,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,How dark and how drear!
169,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And on Christmas morning,"
170,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Why, do you not know,"
171,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The earth must be covered
172,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,All over with snow?”
173,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Then the little flake said,"
174,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"With a brave bright air,"
175,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,“I’m
176,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,going
177,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,to
178,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,get
179,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,ready
180,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,and
181,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,go
182,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,down
183,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,there!”
184,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
185,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration: “I’m so glad!”]
186,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
187,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And then looking down
188,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"On the dark dreary space,"
189,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"The lovely flakes said,"
190,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"“But in such a big place,"
191,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Why, whatever could one"
192,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Tiny snowflake do?
193,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Such a wee little
194,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Delicate bit like you,"
195,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,You just wait half a minute
196,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And we’ll go too!”
197,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
198,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"So they hurried, and skurried,"
199,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And flew around,"
200,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And told every snowflake
201,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,That could be found;
202,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"They waltzed ’round in circles,"
203,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"They danced on tip toe,"
204,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,They could not hold still
205,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Getting ready to go.
206,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
207,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
208,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
209,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And at last they came
210,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Flying, fluttering down,"
211,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"All white in the city,"
212,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,All white in the town.
213,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,They draped every steeple
214,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And tower in sight,"
215,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,They dressed all the trees
216,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Against Christmas night,"
217,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And then covered the ground
218,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,All over with white.
219,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
220,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"They hung to the shutters,"
221,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"They clung to the doors,"
222,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,They went with the customers
223,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Into the stores.
224,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,They tapped on the windows
225,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And peeped thro’ the pane,"
226,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Then in a twinkling
227,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,They vanished again.
228,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And they found everywhere,"
229,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"With merry delight,"
230,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The world getting ready
231,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,To keep Christmas night.
232,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
233,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Now good Mother Snowbank
234,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Up there in the sky,"
235,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Had dropped into a doze
236,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,As the hours slipped by;
237,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
238,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"She awoke with a start,"
239,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And looking around,"
240,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Not one of her snowflakes
241,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Was anywhere found.
242,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
243,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,She tip toed
244,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"In here,"
245,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And she tip toed
246,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Out there,"
247,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
248,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,She turned the clouds over
249,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"With greatest of care,"
250,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Not a sign of a snowflake
251,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Was seen anywhere.
252,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
253,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration: Going to find Santa]
254,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
255,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Then she puffed out her cheeks
256,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And began to blow;
257,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"She whistled up high,"
258,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And she whistled down low;
259,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And she blew, till the tree tops"
260,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Went to and fro.
261,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
262,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,She whistled and blew
263,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Till the air was clear,"
264,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,But the snowflakes pretended
265,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"They did not hear,"
266,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
267,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And each nestled down
268,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"In its chosen retreat,"
269,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,To wait for the click
270,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Of the reindeer’s feet.
271,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
272,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,So good Mother Snowbank
273,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Up there in the sky,"
274,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Just drew in her breath
275,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,With a long drawn sigh—
276,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
277,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Then, she suddenly tore"
278,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"A small cloud in two,"
279,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And in the queer fashion
280,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"That some people do,"
281,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
282,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,She made her a night cap
283,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"To put on her head,"
284,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Then shook up her pillows
285,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And went off to bed.
286,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
287,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
288,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
289,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
290,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
291,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"’Way off up in Northland,"
292,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"His hand to his eyes,"
293,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,In his door stood Santa Claus
294,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Scanning the skies;
295,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
296,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,He saw Mother Snowbank
297,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Go off in a huff,"
298,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And he knew where the snowflakes
299,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Were well enough;
300,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
301,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"For he shook his head,"
302,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And he laughed “Ho, ho, ho!"
303,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Tell me of a Christmas
304,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Without any snow,"
305,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,It’s time I was getting
306,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Things ready to go!”
307,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
308,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,He harnessed his reindeer
309,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"So nimble and fleet,"
310,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The snow would not feel
311,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The light touch of their feet;
312,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,He loaded his sleigh
313,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Full of everything nice,"
314,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Then jumped in himself,"
315,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And was off in a trice—
316,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
317,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"When the reindeer snorted,"
318,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And stamped their small hoofs,"
319,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"People thought ’twas the wind,"
320,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And the snow on the roofs;
321,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,So all unmolested
322,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"He worked with his might,"
323,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And was ready for home
324,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Long before daylight.
325,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
326,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration: The reindeer at home

329,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
330,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Then fainter,"
331,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"and fainter,"
332,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And farther away,"
333,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
334,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Came the
335,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Ting-a-ling-ling,"
336,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,From the vanishing sleigh.
337,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
338,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Back, over the snow"
339,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"It flew like the wind,"
340,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And never once stopping,"
341,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Or looking behind,"
342,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
343,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Old Santa rode on,"
344,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Till he reached
345,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"His own door,"
346,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
347,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Just where
348,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"He had loaded,"
349,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,A short time before.
350,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
351,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
352,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
353,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Then
354,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Over the mountains,"
355,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And over the dells,"
356,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,The world
357,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Set to ringing,"
358,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,With sweet
359,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Christmas bells;
360,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And gifts
361,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And kind wishes,"
362,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Went flying around,"
363,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,As fast as the flakes
364,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,When they fell
365,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,To the ground.
366,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
367,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And the good little flake
368,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"That up in the sky,"
369,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Had looked on the earth
370,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"With a tear in its eye,"
371,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
372,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,At sound of the bells
373,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Fairly shown with delight,"
374,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"For Christmas had come,"
375,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"And the world was in white,"
376,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
377,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And Santa had been
378,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"At the dead of the night,"
379,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"In his reindeer sleigh,"
380,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And was safe out of sight.
381,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
382,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,[Illustration]
383,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,
384,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,And the dear little ones
385,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Whose eyes were so wet,"
386,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Knew now, the snowflakes"
387,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,Did not forget;
388,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,For over the earth
389,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"They were spread far and wide,"
390,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,In a beautiful robe
391,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,For the glad Christmas tide—
392,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,While down to the wondering
393,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"World from above,"
394,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Came the spirit of Peace,"
395,A CHRISTMAS SNOWFLAKE,"Of Goodwill, and Love."
