125,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"There's been a young stranger at our house,"
126,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,A baby whom nobody knew;
127,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"Who hated his brother, his father, his mother,"
128,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"And made them aware of it, too."
129,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,
130,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,He stayed with us nearly a fortnight
131,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"And carried a grouch all the while,"
132,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,Nor promise nor present could make him look pleasant;
133,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,He hadn't the power to smile.
134,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,
135,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,He cried when he couldn't have something;
136,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,He cried just as hard when he could;
137,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"Kind words by the earful but made him more tearful,"
138,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,And scoldings did just as much good.
139,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,
140,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"He stormed when his meals weren't ready,"
141,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"And when they _were_ ready, he screamed."
142,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"He went to bed growling, got up again howling"
143,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,And quarreled and snarled as he dreamed.
144,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,
145,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"He's gone, and the child we are fond of"
146,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,"Is back, just as nice as of old."
147,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,But I hope to be in some port European
148,A VISIT FROM YOUNG GLOOM,The next time he has a bad cold.

161,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,As easy to extract a laugh
162,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,From grown-ups as from thee.
163,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,"Then I'd go on the stage, my boy,"

167,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,I wouldn't have to rack my brain
168,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,Or lie awake all night in vain
169,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,Pursuit of brand new jokes;
170,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,Nor fear my lines were heard with groans
171,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,Of pain and sympathetic moans

174,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,"I'd merely have to make a face,"
175,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,"Just twist a feature out of place,"
176,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,And be the soul of wit;
177,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,"Or bark, and then pretend to bite,"

179,AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE,Be sure I'd made a hit.

191,DISCIPLINE,"He couldn't have a doughnut, and it made him very mad;"
192,DISCIPLINE,He undertook to get revenge by screaming at his dad.
193,DISCIPLINE,
194,DISCIPLINE,"""Cut out that noise!"" I ordered, and he gave another roar,"
195,DISCIPLINE,"And so I put him in ""the room"" and shut and locked the door."
196,DISCIPLINE,
197,DISCIPLINE,"I left him in his prison cell two minutes, just about,"
198,DISCIPLINE,"And, penitent, he smiled at me when I did let him out."
199,DISCIPLINE,
200,DISCIPLINE,But when he got another look at the forbidden fruit
201,DISCIPLINE,He gave a yell that they could hear in Jacksonville or Butte.
202,DISCIPLINE,
203,DISCIPLINE,"""Cut out that noise!"" I barked again. ""Cut out that foghorn stuff!"
204,DISCIPLINE,Perhaps I didn't leave you in your prison long enough.

244,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,Perhaps in some respects it's true
245,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,That you resemble dad;
246,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,To be informed I look like you
247,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,Would never make me mad.
248,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,"But one thing I am sure of, son,"
249,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,You have a different line
250,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,"Of humor, your idea of fun"
251,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,Is not a bit like mine.
252,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,
253,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,You drop my slippers in the sink
254,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,And leave them there to soak.
255,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,"That's very laughable, you think"
256,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,But I can't see the joke
257,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,You take my hat outdoors with you
258,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,And fill it full of earth;
259,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,"You seem to think that's witty, too,"
260,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,But I'm not moved to mirth.
261,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,
262,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,You open up the chicken-yard;
263,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,Its inmates run a mile;
264,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,"You giggle, but I find it hard"
265,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,To force one-half a smile.
266,HIS SENSE OF HUMOR,"No, kid, I fear your funny stuff,"

281,SPEECH ECONOMY,"Since he began to talk and sing,"
282,SPEECH ECONOMY,I've learned one interesting thing--
283,SPEECH ECONOMY,The value of a verb is small;
284,SPEECH ECONOMY,"In fact, it has no worth at all."

286,SPEECH ECONOMY,"Why waste the breath required to say,"
