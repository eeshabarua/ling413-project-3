12,JUST FOLKS,by Edgar A. Guest
13,JUST FOLKS,
14,JUST FOLKS,
15,JUST FOLKS,
16,JUST FOLKS,
17,JUST FOLKS,To  the  Little  Mother and
18,JUST FOLKS,the  Memory  of   the   Big
19,JUST FOLKS,"Father,  This  Simple  Book"
20,JUST FOLKS,Is Affectionately Dedicated
21,JUST FOLKS,
22,JUST FOLKS,
23,JUST FOLKS,
24,JUST FOLKS,
25,JUST FOLKS,Just Folks
26,JUST FOLKS,
27,JUST FOLKS,We're queer folks here.
28,JUST FOLKS,"We'll talk about the weather,"
29,JUST FOLKS,"The good times we have had together,"
30,JUST FOLKS,"The good times near,"
31,JUST FOLKS,"The roses buddin', an' the bees"
32,JUST FOLKS,Once more upon their nectar sprees;
33,JUST FOLKS,"The scarlet fever scare, an' who"
34,JUST FOLKS,"Came mighty near not pullin' through,"
35,JUST FOLKS,"An' who had light attacks, an' all"
36,JUST FOLKS,"The things that int'rest, big or small;"
37,JUST FOLKS,But here you'll never hear of sinnin'
38,JUST FOLKS,Or any scandal that's beginnin'.
39,JUST FOLKS,We've got too many other labors
40,JUST FOLKS,To scatter tales that harm our neighbors.
41,JUST FOLKS,
42,JUST FOLKS,We're strange folks here.
43,JUST FOLKS,"We're tryin' to be cheerful,"
44,JUST FOLKS,An' keep this home from gettin' tearful.
45,JUST FOLKS,We hold it dear
46,JUST FOLKS,"Too dear for pettiness an' meanness,"
47,JUST FOLKS,An' nasty tales of men's uncleanness.
48,JUST FOLKS,"Here you shall come to joyous smilin',"
49,JUST FOLKS,Secure from hate an' harsh revilin';
50,JUST FOLKS,"Here, where the wood fire brightly blazes,"
51,JUST FOLKS,You'll hear from us our neighbor's praises.
52,JUST FOLKS,"Here, that they'll never grow to doubt us,"
53,JUST FOLKS,We keep our friends always about us;
54,JUST FOLKS,"An' here, though storms outside may pelter"
55,JUST FOLKS,"Is refuge for our friends, an' shelter."
56,JUST FOLKS,
57,JUST FOLKS,"We've one rule here,"
58,JUST FOLKS,An' that is to be pleasant.
59,JUST FOLKS,"The folks we know are always present,"
60,JUST FOLKS,Or very near.
61,JUST FOLKS,"An' though they dwell in many places,"
62,JUST FOLKS,We think we're talkin' to their faces;
63,JUST FOLKS,An' that keeps us from only seein'
64,JUST FOLKS,"The faults in any human bein',"
65,JUST FOLKS,An' checks our tongues when they'd go trailin'
66,JUST FOLKS,Into the mire of mortal failin'.
67,JUST FOLKS,Flaws aren't so big when folks are near you;
68,JUST FOLKS,You don't talk mean when they can hear you.
69,JUST FOLKS,"An' so no scandal here is started,"
70,JUST FOLKS,Because from friends we're never parted.
71,JUST FOLKS,
72,JUST FOLKS,
73,JUST FOLKS,
74,JUST FOLKS,
75,JUST FOLKS,As It Goes
76,JUST FOLKS,
77,JUST FOLKS,"In the corner she's left the mechanical toy,"
78,JUST FOLKS,On the chair is her Teddy Bear fine;
79,JUST FOLKS,The things that I thought she would really enjoy
80,JUST FOLKS,Don't seem to be quite in her line.
81,JUST FOLKS,There's the flaxen-haired doll that is lovely to see
82,JUST FOLKS,"And really expensively dressed,"
83,JUST FOLKS,"Left alone, all uncared for, and strange though it be,"
84,JUST FOLKS,She likes her rag dolly the best.
85,JUST FOLKS,
86,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, the money we spent and the plans that we laid"
87,JUST FOLKS,And the wonderful things that we bought!
88,JUST FOLKS,"There are toys that are cunningly, skillfully made,"
89,JUST FOLKS,But she seems not to give them a thought.
90,JUST FOLKS,"She was pleased when she woke and discovered them there,"
91,JUST FOLKS,But never a one of us guessed
92,JUST FOLKS,That it isn't the splendor that makes a gift rare--
93,JUST FOLKS,She likes her rag dolly the best.
94,JUST FOLKS,
95,JUST FOLKS,"There's the flaxen-haired doll, with the real human hair,"
96,JUST FOLKS,"There's the Teddy Bear left all alone,"
97,JUST FOLKS,"There's the automobile at the foot of the stair,"
98,JUST FOLKS,And there is her toy telephone;
99,JUST FOLKS,"We thought they were fine, but a little child's eyes"
100,JUST FOLKS,"Look deeper than ours to find charm,"
101,JUST FOLKS,"And now she's in bed, and the rag dolly lies"
102,JUST FOLKS,Snuggled close on her little white arm.
103,JUST FOLKS,
104,JUST FOLKS,
105,JUST FOLKS,
106,JUST FOLKS,
107,JUST FOLKS,Hollyhocks
108,JUST FOLKS,
109,JUST FOLKS,Old-fashioned flowers! I love them all:
110,JUST FOLKS,"The morning-glories on the wall,"
111,JUST FOLKS,"The pansies in their patch of shade,"
112,JUST FOLKS,"The violets, stolen from a glade,"
113,JUST FOLKS,"The bleeding hearts and columbine,"
114,JUST FOLKS,Have long been garden friends of mine;
115,JUST FOLKS,But memory every summer flocks
116,JUST FOLKS,About a clump of hollyhocks.
117,JUST FOLKS,
118,JUST FOLKS,The mother loved them years ago;
119,JUST FOLKS,"Beside the fence they used to grow,"
120,JUST FOLKS,And though the garden changed each year
121,JUST FOLKS,And certain blooms would disappear
122,JUST FOLKS,To give their places in the ground
123,JUST FOLKS,"To something new that mother found,"
124,JUST FOLKS,Some pretty bloom or rosebush rare--
125,JUST FOLKS,The hollyhocks were always there.
126,JUST FOLKS,
127,JUST FOLKS,It seems but yesterday to me
128,JUST FOLKS,She led me down the yard to see
129,JUST FOLKS,"The first tall spires, with bloom aflame,"
130,JUST FOLKS,And taught me to pronounce their name.
131,JUST FOLKS,"And year by year I watched them grow,"
132,JUST FOLKS,The first flowers I had come to know.
133,JUST FOLKS,And with the mother dear I'd yearn
134,JUST FOLKS,To see the hollyhocks return.
135,JUST FOLKS,
136,JUST FOLKS,The garden of my boyhood days
137,JUST FOLKS,With hollyhocks was kept ablaze;
138,JUST FOLKS,In all my recollections they
139,JUST FOLKS,In friendly columns nod and sway;
140,JUST FOLKS,"And when to-day their blooms I see,"
141,JUST FOLKS,Always the mother smiles at me;
142,JUST FOLKS,"The mind's bright chambers, life unlocks"
143,JUST FOLKS,Each summer with the hollyhocks.
144,JUST FOLKS,
145,JUST FOLKS,
146,JUST FOLKS,
147,JUST FOLKS,
148,JUST FOLKS,Sacrifice
149,JUST FOLKS,
150,JUST FOLKS,When he has more than he can eat
151,JUST FOLKS,To feed a stranger's not a feat.
152,JUST FOLKS,
153,JUST FOLKS,When he has more than he can spend
154,JUST FOLKS,It isn't hard to give or lend.
155,JUST FOLKS,
156,JUST FOLKS,Who gives but what he'll never miss
157,JUST FOLKS,Will never know what giving is.
158,JUST FOLKS,
159,JUST FOLKS,He'll win few praises from his Lord
160,JUST FOLKS,Who does but what he can afford.
161,JUST FOLKS,
162,JUST FOLKS,The widow's mite to heaven went
163,JUST FOLKS,Because real sacrifice it meant.
164,JUST FOLKS,
165,JUST FOLKS,
166,JUST FOLKS,
167,JUST FOLKS,
168,JUST FOLKS,Reward
169,JUST FOLKS,
170,JUST FOLKS,"Don't want medals on my breast,"
171,JUST FOLKS,"Don't want all the glory,"
172,JUST FOLKS,I'm not worrying greatly lest
173,JUST FOLKS,The world won't hear my story.
174,JUST FOLKS,A chance to dream beside a stream
175,JUST FOLKS,Where fish are biting free;
176,JUST FOLKS,"A day or two, 'neath skies of blue,"
177,JUST FOLKS,Is joy enough for me.
178,JUST FOLKS,
179,JUST FOLKS,"I do not ask a hoard of gold,"
180,JUST FOLKS,Nor treasures rich and rare;
181,JUST FOLKS,I don't want all the joys to hold;
182,JUST FOLKS,I only want a share.
183,JUST FOLKS,"Just now and then, away from men"
184,JUST FOLKS,"And all their haunts of pride,"
185,JUST FOLKS,"If I can steal, with rod and reel,"
186,JUST FOLKS,I will be satisfied.
187,JUST FOLKS,
188,JUST FOLKS,I'll gladly work my way through life;
189,JUST FOLKS,I would not always play;
190,JUST FOLKS,I only ask to quit the strife
191,JUST FOLKS,For an occasional day.
192,JUST FOLKS,If I can sneak from toil a week
193,JUST FOLKS,"To chum with stream and tree,"
194,JUST FOLKS,I'll fish away and smiling say
195,JUST FOLKS,That life's been good to me.
196,JUST FOLKS,
197,JUST FOLKS,
198,JUST FOLKS,
199,JUST FOLKS,
200,JUST FOLKS,See It Through
201,JUST FOLKS,
202,JUST FOLKS,"When you're up against a trouble,"
203,JUST FOLKS,"Meet it squarely, face to face;"
204,JUST FOLKS,"Lift your chin and set your shoulders,"
205,JUST FOLKS,Plant your feet and take a brace.
206,JUST FOLKS,"When it's vain to try to dodge it,"
207,JUST FOLKS,Do the best that you can do;
208,JUST FOLKS,"You may fail, but you may conquer,"
209,JUST FOLKS,See it through!
210,JUST FOLKS,
211,JUST FOLKS,Black may be the clouds about you
212,JUST FOLKS,"And your future may seem grim,"
213,JUST FOLKS,But don't let your nerve desert you;
214,JUST FOLKS,Keep yourself in fighting trim.
215,JUST FOLKS,"If the worst is bound to happen,"
216,JUST FOLKS,"Spite of all that you can do,"
217,JUST FOLKS,"Running from it will not save you,"
218,JUST FOLKS,See it through!
219,JUST FOLKS,
220,JUST FOLKS,"Even hope may seem but futile,"
221,JUST FOLKS,"When with troubles you're beset,"
222,JUST FOLKS,But remember you are facing
223,JUST FOLKS,Just what other men have met.
224,JUST FOLKS,"You may fail, but fall still fighting;"
225,JUST FOLKS,"Don't give up, whate'er you do;"
226,JUST FOLKS,"Eyes front, head high to the finish."
227,JUST FOLKS,See it through!
228,JUST FOLKS,
229,JUST FOLKS,
230,JUST FOLKS,
231,JUST FOLKS,
232,JUST FOLKS,To the Humble
233,JUST FOLKS,
234,JUST FOLKS,"If all the flowers were roses,"
235,JUST FOLKS,"If never daisies grew,"
236,JUST FOLKS,If no old-fashioned posies
237,JUST FOLKS,"Drank in the morning dew,"
238,JUST FOLKS,Then man might have some reason
239,JUST FOLKS,"To whimper and complain,"
240,JUST FOLKS,"And speak these words of treason,"
241,JUST FOLKS,That all our toil is vain.
242,JUST FOLKS,
243,JUST FOLKS,If all the stars were Saturns
244,JUST FOLKS,"That twinkle in the night,"
245,JUST FOLKS,"Of equal size and patterns,"
246,JUST FOLKS,"And equally as bright,"
247,JUST FOLKS,"Then men in humble places,"
248,JUST FOLKS,"With humble work to do,"
249,JUST FOLKS,With frowns upon their faces
250,JUST FOLKS,Might trudge their journey through.
251,JUST FOLKS,
252,JUST FOLKS,But humble stars and posies
253,JUST FOLKS,"Still do their best, although"
254,JUST FOLKS,"They're planets not, nor roses,"
255,JUST FOLKS,To cheer the world below.
256,JUST FOLKS,And those old-fashioned daisies
257,JUST FOLKS,Delight the soul of man;
258,JUST FOLKS,"They're here, and this their praise is:"
259,JUST FOLKS,They work the Master's plan.
260,JUST FOLKS,
261,JUST FOLKS,"Though humble be your labor,"
262,JUST FOLKS,"And modest be your sphere,"
263,JUST FOLKS,"Come, envy not your neighbor"
264,JUST FOLKS,Whose light shines brighter here.
265,JUST FOLKS,Does God forget the daisies
266,JUST FOLKS,Because the roses bloom?
267,JUST FOLKS,Shall you not win His praises
268,JUST FOLKS,By toiling at your loom?
269,JUST FOLKS,
270,JUST FOLKS,"Have you, the toiler humble,"
271,JUST FOLKS,"Just reason to complain,"
272,JUST FOLKS,To shirk your task and grumble
273,JUST FOLKS,And think that it is vain
274,JUST FOLKS,Because you see a brother
275,JUST FOLKS,With greater work to do?
276,JUST FOLKS,No fame of his can smother
277,JUST FOLKS,The merit that's in you.
278,JUST FOLKS,
279,JUST FOLKS,
280,JUST FOLKS,
281,JUST FOLKS,
282,JUST FOLKS,When Nellie's on the Job
283,JUST FOLKS,
284,JUST FOLKS,"The bright spots in my life are when the servant quits the place,"
285,JUST FOLKS,Although that grim disturbance brings a frown to Nellie's face;
286,JUST FOLKS,The week between the old girl's' reign and entry of the new
287,JUST FOLKS,Is one that's filled with happiness and comfort through and through.
288,JUST FOLKS,The charm of living's back again--a charm that servants rob--
289,JUST FOLKS,"I like the home, I like the meals, when Nellie's on the job."
290,JUST FOLKS,
291,JUST FOLKS,"There's something in a servant's ways, however fine they be,"
292,JUST FOLKS,That has a cold and distant touch and frets the soul of me.
293,JUST FOLKS,"The old home never looks so well, as in that week or two"
294,JUST FOLKS,That we are servantless and Nell has all the work to do.
295,JUST FOLKS,There is a sense of comfort then that makes my pulses throb
296,JUST FOLKS,And home is as it ought to be when Nellie's on the job.
297,JUST FOLKS,
298,JUST FOLKS,Think not that I'd deny her help or grudge the servant's pay;
299,JUST FOLKS,When one departs we try to get another right away;
300,JUST FOLKS,I merely state the simple fact that no such joys I've known
301,JUST FOLKS,As in those few brief days at home when we've been left alone.
302,JUST FOLKS,There is a gentleness that seems to soothe this selfish elf
303,JUST FOLKS,"And, Oh, I like to eat those meals that Nellie gets herself!"
304,JUST FOLKS,
305,JUST FOLKS,You cannot buy the gentle touch that mother gives the place;
306,JUST FOLKS,No servant girl can do the work with just the proper grace.
307,JUST FOLKS,"And though you hired the queen of cooks to fashion your croquettes,"
308,JUST FOLKS,Her meals would not compare with those your loving comrade gets;
309,JUST FOLKS,"So, though the maid has quit again, and she is moved to sob,"
310,JUST FOLKS,"The old home's at its finest now, for Nellie's on the job."
311,JUST FOLKS,
312,JUST FOLKS,
313,JUST FOLKS,
314,JUST FOLKS,
315,JUST FOLKS,"The Old, Old Story"
316,JUST FOLKS,
317,JUST FOLKS,"I have no wish to rail at fate,"
318,JUST FOLKS,And vow that I'm unfairly treated;
319,JUST FOLKS,I do not give vent to my hate
320,JUST FOLKS,Because at times I am defeated.
321,JUST FOLKS,"Life has its ups and downs, I know,"
322,JUST FOLKS,But tell me why should people say
323,JUST FOLKS,Whenever after fish I go:
324,JUST FOLKS,"""You should have been here yesterday""?"
325,JUST FOLKS,
326,JUST FOLKS,It is my luck always to strike
327,JUST FOLKS,"A day when there is nothing doing,"
328,JUST FOLKS,"When neither perch, nor bass, nor pike"
329,JUST FOLKS,My baited hooks will come a-wooing.
330,JUST FOLKS,Must I a day late always be?
331,JUST FOLKS,When not a nibble comes my way
332,JUST FOLKS,Must someone always say to me:
333,JUST FOLKS,"""We caught a bunch here yesterday""?"
334,JUST FOLKS,
335,JUST FOLKS,"I am not prone to discontent,"
336,JUST FOLKS,Nor over-zealous now to climb;
337,JUST FOLKS,If victory is not yet meant
338,JUST FOLKS,For me I'll calmly bide my time.
339,JUST FOLKS,But I should like just once to go
340,JUST FOLKS,Out fishing on some lake or bay
341,JUST FOLKS,"And not have someone mutter: ""Oh,"
342,JUST FOLKS,"You should have been here yesterday."""
343,JUST FOLKS,
344,JUST FOLKS,The Pup
345,JUST FOLKS,
346,JUST FOLKS,"He tore the curtains yesterday,"
347,JUST FOLKS,And scratched the paper on the wall;
348,JUST FOLKS,"Ma's rubbers, too, have gone astray--"
349,JUST FOLKS,She says she left them in the hall;
350,JUST FOLKS,He tugged the table cloth and broke
351,JUST FOLKS,A fancy saucer and a cup;
352,JUST FOLKS,Though Bud and I think it a joke
353,JUST FOLKS,Ma scolds a lot about the pup.
354,JUST FOLKS,
355,JUST FOLKS,"The sofa pillows are a sight,"
356,JUST FOLKS,"The rugs are looking somewhat frayed,"
357,JUST FOLKS,"And there is ruin, left and right,"
358,JUST FOLKS,That little Boston bull has made.
359,JUST FOLKS,He slept on Buddy's counterpane--
360,JUST FOLKS,Ma found him there when she woke up.
361,JUST FOLKS,I think it needless to explain
362,JUST FOLKS,She scolds a lot about the pup.
363,JUST FOLKS,
364,JUST FOLKS,And yet he comes and licks her hand
365,JUST FOLKS,And sometimes climbs into her lap
366,JUST FOLKS,"And there, Bud lets me understand,"
367,JUST FOLKS,He very often takes his nap.
368,JUST FOLKS,And Bud and I have learned to know
369,JUST FOLKS,She wouldn't give the rascal up:
370,JUST FOLKS,"She's really fond of him, although"
371,JUST FOLKS,She scolds a lot about the pup.
372,JUST FOLKS,
373,JUST FOLKS,
374,JUST FOLKS,
375,JUST FOLKS,
376,JUST FOLKS,Since Jessie Died
377,JUST FOLKS,
378,JUST FOLKS,"We understand a lot of things we never did before,"
379,JUST FOLKS,And it seems that to each other Ma and I are meaning more.
380,JUST FOLKS,"I don't know how to say it, but since little Jessie died"
381,JUST FOLKS,We have learned that to be happy we must travel side by side.
382,JUST FOLKS,"You can share your joys and pleasures, but you never come to know"
383,JUST FOLKS,"The depth there is in loving, till you've got a common woe."
384,JUST FOLKS,
385,JUST FOLKS,We're past the hurt of fretting--we can talk about it now:
386,JUST FOLKS,She slipped away so gently and the fever left her brow
387,JUST FOLKS,"So softly that we didn't know we'd lost her, but, instead,"
388,JUST FOLKS,We thought her only sleeping as we watched beside her bed.
389,JUST FOLKS,"Then the doctor, I remember, raised his head, as if to say"
390,JUST FOLKS,"What his eyes had told already, and Ma fainted dead away."
391,JUST FOLKS,
392,JUST FOLKS,Up to then I thought that money was the thing I ought to get;
393,JUST FOLKS,"And I fancied, once I had it, I should never have to fret."
394,JUST FOLKS,But I saw that I had wasted precious hours in seeking wealth;
395,JUST FOLKS,"I had made a tidy fortune, but I couldn't buy her health."
396,JUST FOLKS,And I saw this truth much clearer than I'd ever seen before:
397,JUST FOLKS,That the rich man and the poor man have to let death through the door.
398,JUST FOLKS,
399,JUST FOLKS,We're not half so keen for money as one time we used to be;
400,JUST FOLKS,I am thinking more of mother and she's thinking more of me.
401,JUST FOLKS,"Now we spend more time together, and I know we're meaning more"
402,JUST FOLKS,"To each other on life's journey, than we ever meant before."
403,JUST FOLKS,"It was hard to understand it! Oh, the dreary nights we've cried!"
404,JUST FOLKS,"But we've found the depth of loving, since the day that Jessie died."
405,JUST FOLKS,
406,JUST FOLKS,
407,JUST FOLKS,
408,JUST FOLKS,
409,JUST FOLKS,Hard Luck
410,JUST FOLKS,
411,JUST FOLKS,Ain't no use as I can see
412,JUST FOLKS,In sittin' underneath a tree
413,JUST FOLKS,"An' growlin' that your luck is bad,"
414,JUST FOLKS,An' that your life is extry sad;
415,JUST FOLKS,Your life ain't sadder than your neighbor's
416,JUST FOLKS,Nor any harder are your labors;
417,JUST FOLKS,"It rains on him the same as you,"
418,JUST FOLKS,An' he has work he hates to do;
419,JUST FOLKS,"An' he gits tired an' he gits cross,"
420,JUST FOLKS,An' he has trouble with the boss;
421,JUST FOLKS,"You take his whole life, through an' through,"
422,JUST FOLKS,"Why, he's no better off than you."
423,JUST FOLKS,
424,JUST FOLKS,If whinin' brushed the clouds away
425,JUST FOLKS,I wouldn't have a word to say;
426,JUST FOLKS,If it made good friends out o' foes
427,JUST FOLKS,"I'd whine a bit, too, I suppose;"
428,JUST FOLKS,But when I look around an' see
429,JUST FOLKS,"A lot o' men resemblin' me,"
430,JUST FOLKS,"An' see 'em sad, an' see 'em gay"
431,JUST FOLKS,"With work t' do most every day,"
432,JUST FOLKS,"Some full o' fun, some bent with care,"
433,JUST FOLKS,"Some havin' troubles hard to bear,"
434,JUST FOLKS,"I reckon, as I count my woes,"
435,JUST FOLKS,They're 'bout what everybody knows.
436,JUST FOLKS,
437,JUST FOLKS,The day I find a man who'll say
438,JUST FOLKS,"He's never known a rainy day,"
439,JUST FOLKS,Who'll raise his right hand up an' swear
440,JUST FOLKS,"In forty years he's had no care,"
441,JUST FOLKS,"Has never had a single blow,"
442,JUST FOLKS,"An' never known one touch o' woe,"
443,JUST FOLKS,"Has never seen a loved one die,"
444,JUST FOLKS,"Has never wept or heaved a sigh,"
445,JUST FOLKS,"Has never had a plan go wrong,"
446,JUST FOLKS,But allus laughed his way along;
447,JUST FOLKS,Then I'll sit down an' start to whine
448,JUST FOLKS,That all the hard luck here is mine.
449,JUST FOLKS,
450,JUST FOLKS,
451,JUST FOLKS,
452,JUST FOLKS,
453,JUST FOLKS,Vacation Time
454,JUST FOLKS,
455,JUST FOLKS,Vacation time! How glad it seemed
456,JUST FOLKS,When as a boy I sat and dreamed
457,JUST FOLKS,"Above my school books, of the fun"
458,JUST FOLKS,That I should claim when toil was done;
459,JUST FOLKS,"And, Oh, how oft my youthful eye"
460,JUST FOLKS,Went wandering with the patch of sky
461,JUST FOLKS,That drifted by the window panes
462,JUST FOLKS,"O'er pleasant fields and dusty lanes,"
463,JUST FOLKS,Where I would race and romp and shout
464,JUST FOLKS,The very moment school was out.
465,JUST FOLKS,My artful little fingers then
466,JUST FOLKS,"Feigned labor with the ink and pen,"
467,JUST FOLKS,"But heart and mind were far away,"
468,JUST FOLKS,Engaged in some glad bit of play.
469,JUST FOLKS,The last two weeks dragged slowly by;
470,JUST FOLKS,Time hadn't then learned how to fly.
471,JUST FOLKS,It seemed the clock upon the wall
472,JUST FOLKS,"From hour to hour could only crawl,"
473,JUST FOLKS,"And when the teacher called my name,"
474,JUST FOLKS,"Unto my cheeks the crimson came,"
475,JUST FOLKS,For I could give no answer clear
476,JUST FOLKS,To questions that I didn't hear.
477,JUST FOLKS,"""Wool gathering, were you?"" oft she said"
478,JUST FOLKS,And smiled to see me blushing red.
479,JUST FOLKS,Her voice had roused me from a dream
480,JUST FOLKS,"Where I was fishing in a stream,"
481,JUST FOLKS,"And, if I now recall it right,"
482,JUST FOLKS,Just at the time I had a bite.
483,JUST FOLKS,
484,JUST FOLKS,And now my youngsters dream of play
485,JUST FOLKS,In just the very selfsame way;
486,JUST FOLKS,And they complain that time is slow
487,JUST FOLKS,And that the term will never go.
488,JUST FOLKS,Their little minds with plans are filled
489,JUST FOLKS,"For joyous hours they soon will build,"
490,JUST FOLKS,"And it is vain for me to say,"
491,JUST FOLKS,"That have grown old and wise and gray,"
492,JUST FOLKS,"That time is swift, and joy is brief;"
493,JUST FOLKS,They'll put no faith in such belief.
494,JUST FOLKS,To youthful hearts that long for play
495,JUST FOLKS,Time is a laggard on the way.
496,JUST FOLKS,"'Twas, Oh, so slow to me back then"
497,JUST FOLKS,Ere I had learned the ways of men!
498,JUST FOLKS,
499,JUST FOLKS,
500,JUST FOLKS,
501,JUST FOLKS,
502,JUST FOLKS,The Little Hurts
503,JUST FOLKS,
504,JUST FOLKS,Every night she runs to me
505,JUST FOLKS,"With a bandaged arm or a bandaged knee,"
506,JUST FOLKS,"A stone-bruised heel or a swollen brow,"
507,JUST FOLKS,And in sorrowful tones she tells me how
508,JUST FOLKS,"She fell and ""hurted herse'f to-day"""
509,JUST FOLKS,"While she was having the ""bestest play."""
510,JUST FOLKS,
511,JUST FOLKS,And I take her up in my arms and kiss
512,JUST FOLKS,The new little wounds and whisper this:
513,JUST FOLKS,"""Oh, you must be careful, my little one,"
514,JUST FOLKS,"You mustn't get hurt while your daddy's gone,"
515,JUST FOLKS,For every cut with its ache and smart
516,JUST FOLKS,"Leaves another bruise on your daddy's heart."""
517,JUST FOLKS,
518,JUST FOLKS,Every night I must stoop to see
519,JUST FOLKS,The fresh little cuts on her arm or knee;
520,JUST FOLKS,"The little hurts that have marred her play,"
521,JUST FOLKS,And brought the tears on a happy day;
522,JUST FOLKS,For the path of childhood is oft beset
523,JUST FOLKS,With care and trouble and things that fret.
524,JUST FOLKS,
525,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, little girl, when you older grow,"
526,JUST FOLKS,Far greater hurts than these you'll know;
527,JUST FOLKS,"Greater bruises will bring your tears,"
528,JUST FOLKS,"Around the bend of the lane of years,"
529,JUST FOLKS,But come to your daddy with them at night
530,JUST FOLKS,And he'll do his best to make all things right.
531,JUST FOLKS,
532,JUST FOLKS,
533,JUST FOLKS,
534,JUST FOLKS,
535,JUST FOLKS,The Lanes of Memory
536,JUST FOLKS,
537,JUST FOLKS,"Adown the lanes of memory bloom all the flowers of yesteryear,"
538,JUST FOLKS,"And looking back we smile to see life's bright red roses reappear,"
539,JUST FOLKS,"The little sprigs of mignonette that smiled upon us as we passed,"
540,JUST FOLKS,"The pansy and the violet, too sweet, we thought those days, to last."
541,JUST FOLKS,
542,JUST FOLKS,"The gentle mother by the door caresses still her lilac blooms,"
543,JUST FOLKS,"And as we wander back once more we seem to smell the old perfumes,"
544,JUST FOLKS,We seem to live again the joys that once were ours so long ago
545,JUST FOLKS,"When we were little girls and boys, with all the charms we used to know."
546,JUST FOLKS,
547,JUST FOLKS,"But living things grow old and fade; the dead in memory remain,"
548,JUST FOLKS,"In all their splendid youth arrayed, exempt from suffering and pain;"
549,JUST FOLKS,"The little babe God called away, so many, many years ago,"
550,JUST FOLKS,"Is still a little babe to-day, and I am glad that this is so."
551,JUST FOLKS,
552,JUST FOLKS,Time has not changed the joys we knew; the summer rains or winter snows
553,JUST FOLKS,Have failed to harm the wondrous hue of any dew-kissed bygone rose;
554,JUST FOLKS,"In memory 'tis still as fair as when we plucked it for our own,"
555,JUST FOLKS,"And we can see it blooming there, if anything more lovely grown."
556,JUST FOLKS,
557,JUST FOLKS,"Adown the lanes of memory bloom all the joys of yesteryear,"
558,JUST FOLKS,And God has given you and me the power to make them reappear;
559,JUST FOLKS,For we can settle back at night and live again the joys we knew
560,JUST FOLKS,And taste once more the old delight of days when all our skies were blue.
561,JUST FOLKS,
562,JUST FOLKS,
563,JUST FOLKS,
564,JUST FOLKS,
565,JUST FOLKS,The Day of Days
566,JUST FOLKS,
567,JUST FOLKS,A year is filled with glad events:
568,JUST FOLKS,"The best is Christmas day,"
569,JUST FOLKS,But every holiday presents
570,JUST FOLKS,"Its special round of play,"
571,JUST FOLKS,And looking back on boyhood now
572,JUST FOLKS,"And all the charms it knew,"
573,JUST FOLKS,"One day, above the rest, somehow,"
574,JUST FOLKS,Seems brightest in review.
575,JUST FOLKS,"That day was finest, I believe;"
576,JUST FOLKS,"Though many grown-ups scoff,"
577,JUST FOLKS,When mother said that we could leave
578,JUST FOLKS,Our shoes and stockings off.
579,JUST FOLKS,
580,JUST FOLKS,Through all the pleasant days of spring
581,JUST FOLKS,We begged to know once more
582,JUST FOLKS,The joy of barefoot wandering
583,JUST FOLKS,And quit the shoes we wore;
584,JUST FOLKS,But always mother shook her head
585,JUST FOLKS,And answered with a smile:
586,JUST FOLKS,"""It is too soon, too soon,"" she said."
587,JUST FOLKS,"""Wait just a little while."""
588,JUST FOLKS,Then came that glorious day at last
589,JUST FOLKS,When mother let us know
590,JUST FOLKS,That fear of taking cold was past
591,JUST FOLKS,And we could barefoot go.
592,JUST FOLKS,
593,JUST FOLKS,"Though Christmas day meant much to me,"
594,JUST FOLKS,And eagerly I'd try
595,JUST FOLKS,The first boy on the street to be
596,JUST FOLKS,"The Fourth day of July,"
597,JUST FOLKS,I think: the summit of my joy
598,JUST FOLKS,Was reached that happy day
599,JUST FOLKS,"Each year, when, as a barefoot boy,"
600,JUST FOLKS,I hastened out to play.
601,JUST FOLKS,"Could I return to childhood fair,"
602,JUST FOLKS,That day I think I'd choose
603,JUST FOLKS,When mother said I needn't wear
604,JUST FOLKS,My stockings and my shoes.
605,JUST FOLKS,
606,JUST FOLKS,
607,JUST FOLKS,
608,JUST FOLKS,
609,JUST FOLKS,A Fine Sight
610,JUST FOLKS,
611,JUST FOLKS,I reckon the finest sight of all
612,JUST FOLKS,That a man can see in this world of ours
613,JUST FOLKS,"Ain't the works of art on the gallery wall,"
614,JUST FOLKS,"Or the red an' white o' the fust spring flowers,"
615,JUST FOLKS,Or a hoard o' gold from the yellow mines;
616,JUST FOLKS,But the' sight that'll make ye want t' yell
617,JUST FOLKS,Is t' catch a glimpse o' the fust pink signs
618,JUST FOLKS,"In yer baby's cheek, that she's gittin' well."
619,JUST FOLKS,
620,JUST FOLKS,When ye see the pink jes' a-creepin' back
621,JUST FOLKS,"T' the pale, drawn cheek, an' ye note a smile,"
622,JUST FOLKS,"Then th' cords o' yer heart that were tight, grow slack"
623,JUST FOLKS,"An' ye jump fer joy every little while,"
624,JUST FOLKS,An' ye tiptoe back to her little bed
625,JUST FOLKS,"As though ye doubted yer eyes, or were"
626,JUST FOLKS,"Afraid it was fever come back instead,"
627,JUST FOLKS,An' ye found that th' pink still blossomed there.
628,JUST FOLKS,
629,JUST FOLKS,Ye've watched fer that smile an' that bit o' bloom
630,JUST FOLKS,With a heavy heart fer weeks an' weeks;
631,JUST FOLKS,An' a castle o' joy becomes that room
632,JUST FOLKS,When ye glimpse th' pink 'in yer baby's cheeks.
633,JUST FOLKS,"An' out o' yer breast flies a weight o' care,"
634,JUST FOLKS,"An' ye're lifted up by some magic spell,"
635,JUST FOLKS,An' yer heart jes' naturally beats a prayer
636,JUST FOLKS,O' joy to the Lord 'cause she's gittin' well.
637,JUST FOLKS,
638,JUST FOLKS,
639,JUST FOLKS,
640,JUST FOLKS,
641,JUST FOLKS,Manhood's Greeting
642,JUST FOLKS,
643,JUST FOLKS,"I've' felt some little thrills of pride, I've inwardly rejoiced"
644,JUST FOLKS,Along the pleasant lanes of life to hear my praises voiced;
645,JUST FOLKS,"No great distinction have I claimed, but in a humble way"
646,JUST FOLKS,Some satisfactions sweet have come to brighten many a day;
647,JUST FOLKS,But of the joyous thrills of life the finest that could be
648,JUST FOLKS,"Was mine upon that day when first a stranger ""mistered"" me."
649,JUST FOLKS,
650,JUST FOLKS,"I had my first long trousers on, and wore a derby too,"
651,JUST FOLKS,But I was still a little boy to everyone I knew.
652,JUST FOLKS,"I dressed in manly fashion, and I tried to act the part,"
653,JUST FOLKS,But I felt that I was awkward and lacked the manly art.
654,JUST FOLKS,And then that kindly stranger spoke my name and set me free;
655,JUST FOLKS,"I was sure I'd come to manhood on the day he ""mistered"" me."
656,JUST FOLKS,
657,JUST FOLKS,"I never shall forget the joy that suddenly was mine,"
658,JUST FOLKS,"The sweetness of the thrill that seemed to dance along my spine,"
659,JUST FOLKS,"The pride that swelled within me, as he shook my youthful hand"
660,JUST FOLKS,And treated me as big enough with grown up men to stand.
661,JUST FOLKS,"I felt my body straighten and a stiffening at each knee,"
662,JUST FOLKS,"And was gloriously happy, just because he'd ""mistered"" me."
663,JUST FOLKS,
664,JUST FOLKS,"I cannot now recall his name, I only wish I could."
665,JUST FOLKS,I've often wondered if that day he really understood
666,JUST FOLKS,"How much it meant unto a boy, still wearing boyhood's tan,"
667,JUST FOLKS,To find that others noticed that he'd grown to be a man.
668,JUST FOLKS,Now I try to treat as equal every growing boy I see
669,JUST FOLKS,"In memory of that kindly man--the first to ""mister"" me."
670,JUST FOLKS,
671,JUST FOLKS,
672,JUST FOLKS,
673,JUST FOLKS,
674,JUST FOLKS,Fishing Nooks
675,JUST FOLKS,
676,JUST FOLKS,"""Men will grow weary,"" said the Lord,"
677,JUST FOLKS,"""Of working for their bed and board."
678,JUST FOLKS,They'll weary of the money chase
679,JUST FOLKS,And want to find a resting place
680,JUST FOLKS,Where hum of wheel is never heard
681,JUST FOLKS,"And no one speaks an angry word,"
682,JUST FOLKS,And selfishness and greed and pride
683,JUST FOLKS,And petty motives don't abide.
684,JUST FOLKS,They'll need a place where they can go
685,JUST FOLKS,To wash their souls as white as snow.
686,JUST FOLKS,They will be better men and true
687,JUST FOLKS,"If they can play a day or two."""
688,JUST FOLKS,
689,JUST FOLKS,The Lord then made the brooks to flow
690,JUST FOLKS,"And fashioned rivers here below,"
691,JUST FOLKS,And many lakes; for water seems
692,JUST FOLKS,Best suited for a mortal's dreams.
693,JUST FOLKS,He placed about them willow trees
694,JUST FOLKS,"To catch the murmur of the breeze,"
695,JUST FOLKS,And sent the birds that sing the best
696,JUST FOLKS,Among the foliage to nest.
697,JUST FOLKS,He filled each pond and stream and lake
698,JUST FOLKS,With fish for man to come and take;
699,JUST FOLKS,Then stretched a velvet carpet deep
700,JUST FOLKS,On which a weary soul could sleep.
701,JUST FOLKS,
702,JUST FOLKS,It seemed to me the Good Lord knew
703,JUST FOLKS,That man would want something to do
704,JUST FOLKS,When worn and wearied with the stress
705,JUST FOLKS,Of battling hard for world success.
706,JUST FOLKS,When sick at heart of all the strife
707,JUST FOLKS,"And pettiness of daily life,"
708,JUST FOLKS,"He knew he'd need, from time to time,"
709,JUST FOLKS,"To cleanse himself of city grime,"
710,JUST FOLKS,And he would want some place to be
711,JUST FOLKS,Where hate and greed he'd never see.
712,JUST FOLKS,And so on lakes and streams and brooks
713,JUST FOLKS,The Good Lord fashioned fishing nooks.
714,JUST FOLKS,
715,JUST FOLKS,
716,JUST FOLKS,
717,JUST FOLKS,
718,JUST FOLKS,Show the Flag
719,JUST FOLKS,
720,JUST FOLKS,Show the flag and let it wave
721,JUST FOLKS,As a symbol of the brave
722,JUST FOLKS,Let it float upon the breeze
723,JUST FOLKS,As a sign for each who sees
724,JUST FOLKS,"That beneath it, where it rides,"
725,JUST FOLKS,Loyalty to-day abides.
726,JUST FOLKS,
727,JUST FOLKS,Show the flag and signify
728,JUST FOLKS,That it wasn't born to die;
729,JUST FOLKS,Let its colors speak for you
730,JUST FOLKS,"That you still are standing true,"
731,JUST FOLKS,True in sight of God and man
732,JUST FOLKS,To the work that flag began.
733,JUST FOLKS,
734,JUST FOLKS,Show the flag that all may see
735,JUST FOLKS,That you serve humanity.
736,JUST FOLKS,Let it whisper to the breeze
737,JUST FOLKS,That comes singing through the trees
738,JUST FOLKS,That whatever storms descend
739,JUST FOLKS,You'll be faithful to the end.
740,JUST FOLKS,
741,JUST FOLKS,"Show the flag and let it fly,"
742,JUST FOLKS,Cheering every passer-by.
743,JUST FOLKS,"Men that may have stepped aside,"
744,JUST FOLKS,"May have lost their old-time pride,"
745,JUST FOLKS,"May behold it there, and then,"
746,JUST FOLKS,Consecrate themselves again.
747,JUST FOLKS,
748,JUST FOLKS,Show the flag! The day is gone
749,JUST FOLKS,When men blindly hurry on
750,JUST FOLKS,Serving only gods of gold;
751,JUST FOLKS,Now the spirit that was cold
752,JUST FOLKS,Warms again to courage fine.
753,JUST FOLKS,Show the flag and fall in line!
754,JUST FOLKS,
755,JUST FOLKS,
756,JUST FOLKS,
757,JUST FOLKS,
758,JUST FOLKS,Constant Beauty
759,JUST FOLKS,
760,JUST FOLKS,"It's good to have the trees again, the singing of the breeze again,"
761,JUST FOLKS,It's good to see the lilacs bloom as lovely as of old.
762,JUST FOLKS,"It's good that we can feel again the touch of beauties real again,"
763,JUST FOLKS,"For hearts and minds, of sorrow now, have all that they can hold."
764,JUST FOLKS,
765,JUST FOLKS,"The roses haven't changed a bit, nor have the lilacs stranged a bit,"
766,JUST FOLKS,They bud and bloom the way they did before the war began.
767,JUST FOLKS,"The world is upside down to-day, there's much to make us frown to-day,"
768,JUST FOLKS,And gloom and sadness everywhere beset the path of man.
769,JUST FOLKS,
770,JUST FOLKS,"But now the lilacs bloom again and give us their perfume again,"
771,JUST FOLKS,And now the roses smile at us and nod along the way;
772,JUST FOLKS,"And it is good to see again the blossoms on each tree again,"
773,JUST FOLKS,And feel that nature hasn't changed the way we have to-day.
774,JUST FOLKS,
775,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, we have changed from what we were; we're not the carefree lot we were;"
776,JUST FOLKS,"Our hearts are filled with sorrow now and grave concern and pain,"
777,JUST FOLKS,"But it is good to see once more, the blooming lilac tree once more,"
778,JUST FOLKS,And find the constant roses here to comfort us again.
779,JUST FOLKS,
780,JUST FOLKS,
781,JUST FOLKS,
782,JUST FOLKS,
783,JUST FOLKS,A Patriotic Creed
784,JUST FOLKS,
785,JUST FOLKS,To serve my country day by day
786,JUST FOLKS,At any humble post I may;
787,JUST FOLKS,"To honor and respect her flag,"
788,JUST FOLKS,To live the traits of which I brag;
789,JUST FOLKS,To be American in deed
790,JUST FOLKS,As well as in my printed creed.
791,JUST FOLKS,
792,JUST FOLKS,"To stand for truth and honest toil,"
793,JUST FOLKS,"To till my little patch of soil,"
794,JUST FOLKS,And keep in mind the debt I owe
795,JUST FOLKS,To them who died that I might know
796,JUST FOLKS,"My country, prosperous and free,"
797,JUST FOLKS,And passed this heritage to me.
798,JUST FOLKS,
799,JUST FOLKS,I always must in trouble's hour
800,JUST FOLKS,Be guided by the men in power;
801,JUST FOLKS,"For God and country I must live,"
802,JUST FOLKS,My best for God and country give;
803,JUST FOLKS,No act of mine that men may scan
804,JUST FOLKS,Must shame the name American.
805,JUST FOLKS,
806,JUST FOLKS,"To do my best and play my part,"
807,JUST FOLKS,American in mind and heart;
808,JUST FOLKS,To serve the flag and bravely stand
809,JUST FOLKS,To guard the glory of my land;
810,JUST FOLKS,To be American in deed:
811,JUST FOLKS,God grant me strength to keep this creed!
812,JUST FOLKS,
813,JUST FOLKS,
814,JUST FOLKS,
815,JUST FOLKS,
816,JUST FOLKS,Home
817,JUST FOLKS,
818,JUST FOLKS,"The road to laughter beckons me,"
819,JUST FOLKS,The road to all that's best;
820,JUST FOLKS,The home road where I nightly see
821,JUST FOLKS,The castle of my rest;
822,JUST FOLKS,"The path where all is fine and fair,"
823,JUST FOLKS,"And little children run,"
824,JUST FOLKS,For love and joy are waiting there
825,JUST FOLKS,As soon as day is done.
826,JUST FOLKS,
827,JUST FOLKS,There is no rich reward of fame
828,JUST FOLKS,That can compare with this:
829,JUST FOLKS,"At home I wear an honest name,"
830,JUST FOLKS,My lips are fit to kiss.
831,JUST FOLKS,"At home I'm always brave and strong,"
832,JUST FOLKS,And with the setting sun
833,JUST FOLKS,They find no trace of shame or wrong
834,JUST FOLKS,In anything I've done.
835,JUST FOLKS,
836,JUST FOLKS,There shine the eyes that only see
837,JUST FOLKS,The good I've tried to do;
838,JUST FOLKS,They think me what I'd like to be;
839,JUST FOLKS,They know that I am true.
840,JUST FOLKS,And whether I have lost my fight
841,JUST FOLKS,"Or whether I have won,"
842,JUST FOLKS,I find a faith that I've been right
843,JUST FOLKS,As soon as day is done.

847,JUST FOLKS,
848,JUST FOLKS,The Old-Time Family
849,JUST FOLKS,
850,JUST FOLKS,It makes me smile to hear 'em tell each other nowadays
851,JUST FOLKS,"The burdens they are bearing, with a child or two to raise."
852,JUST FOLKS,Of course the cost of living has gone soaring to the sky
853,JUST FOLKS,And our kids are wearing garments that my parents couldn't buy.
854,JUST FOLKS,"Now my father wasn't wealthy, but I never heard him squeal"
855,JUST FOLKS,Because eight of us were sitting at the table every meal.
856,JUST FOLKS,
857,JUST FOLKS,"People fancy they are martyrs if their children number three,"
858,JUST FOLKS,And four or five they reckon makes a large-sized family.
859,JUST FOLKS,A dozen hungry youngsters at a table I have seen
860,JUST FOLKS,And their daddy didn't grumble when they licked the platter clean.
861,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, I wonder how these mothers and these fathers up-to-date"
862,JUST FOLKS,Would like the job of buying little shoes for seven or eight.
863,JUST FOLKS,
864,JUST FOLKS,"We were eight around the table in those happy days back them,"
865,JUST FOLKS,Eight that cleaned our plates of pot-pie and then passed them up again;
866,JUST FOLKS,"Eight that needed shoes and stockings, eight to wash and put to bed,"
867,JUST FOLKS,"And with mighty little money in the purse, as I have said,"
868,JUST FOLKS,"But with all the care we brought them, and through all the days of stress,"
869,JUST FOLKS,I never heard my father or my mother wish for less.

874,JUST FOLKS,The Job
875,JUST FOLKS,
876,JUST FOLKS,"The job will not make you, my boy;"
877,JUST FOLKS,The job will not bring you to fame
878,JUST FOLKS,Or riches or honor or joy
879,JUST FOLKS,Or add any weight to your name.
880,JUST FOLKS,"You may fail or succeed where you are,"
881,JUST FOLKS,May honestly serve or may rob;
882,JUST FOLKS,From the start to the end
883,JUST FOLKS,Your success will depend
884,JUST FOLKS,On just what you make of your job.
885,JUST FOLKS,
886,JUST FOLKS,Don't look on the job as the thing
887,JUST FOLKS,That shall prove what you're able to do;
888,JUST FOLKS,The job does no more than to bring
889,JUST FOLKS,A chance for promotion to you.
890,JUST FOLKS,Men have shirked in high places and won
891,JUST FOLKS,Very justly the jeers of the mob;
892,JUST FOLKS,And you'll find it is true
893,JUST FOLKS,That it's all up to you
894,JUST FOLKS,To say what shall come from the job.
895,JUST FOLKS,
896,JUST FOLKS,The job is an incident small;
897,JUST FOLKS,The thing that's important is man.
898,JUST FOLKS,The job will not help you at all
899,JUST FOLKS,If you won't do the best that you can.
900,JUST FOLKS,"It is you that determines your fate,"
901,JUST FOLKS,You stand with your hand on the knob
902,JUST FOLKS,"Of fame's doorway to-day,"
903,JUST FOLKS,And life asks you to say
904,JUST FOLKS,Just what you will make of your job.

909,JUST FOLKS,Toys
910,JUST FOLKS,
911,JUST FOLKS,I can pass up the lure of a jewel to wear
912,JUST FOLKS,"With never the trace of a sigh,"
913,JUST FOLKS,The things on a shelf that I'd like for myself
914,JUST FOLKS,I never regret I can't buy.
915,JUST FOLKS,I can go through the town passing store after store
916,JUST FOLKS,"Showing things it would please me to own,"
917,JUST FOLKS,"With never a trace of despair on my face,"
918,JUST FOLKS,But I can't let a toy shop alone.
919,JUST FOLKS,
920,JUST FOLKS,I can throttle the love of fine raiment to death
921,JUST FOLKS,"And I don't know the craving for rum,"
922,JUST FOLKS,"But I do know the joy that is born of a toy,"
923,JUST FOLKS,And the pleasure that comes with a drum
924,JUST FOLKS,"I can reckon the value of money at times,"
925,JUST FOLKS,"And govern my purse strings with sense,"
926,JUST FOLKS,But I fall for a toy for my girl or my boy
927,JUST FOLKS,And never regard the expense.
928,JUST FOLKS,
929,JUST FOLKS,It's seldom I sigh for unlimited gold
930,JUST FOLKS,Or the power of a rich man to buy;
931,JUST FOLKS,My courage is stout when the doing without
932,JUST FOLKS,"Is only my duty, but I"
933,JUST FOLKS,Curse the shackles of thrift when I gaze at the toys
934,JUST FOLKS,"That my kiddies are eager to own,"
935,JUST FOLKS,"And I'd buy everything that they wish for, by Jing!"
936,JUST FOLKS,If their mother would let me alone.
937,JUST FOLKS,
938,JUST FOLKS,There isn't much fun spending coin on myself
939,JUST FOLKS,"For neckties and up-to-date lids,"
940,JUST FOLKS,"But there's pleasure tenfold, in the silver and gold"
941,JUST FOLKS,I part with for things for the kids.
942,JUST FOLKS,I can go through the town passing store after store
943,JUST FOLKS,"Showing things it would please me to own,"
944,JUST FOLKS,But to thrift I am lost; I won't reckon the cost
945,JUST FOLKS,When I'm left in a toy shop alone.

950,JUST FOLKS,The Mother on the Sidewalk
951,JUST FOLKS,
952,JUST FOLKS,The mother on the sidewalk as the troops are marching by
953,JUST FOLKS,Is the mother of Old Glory that is waving in the sky.
954,JUST FOLKS,"Men have fought to keep it splendid, men have died to keep it bright,"
955,JUST FOLKS,But that flag was born of woman and her sufferings day and night;
956,JUST FOLKS,"'Tis her sacrifice has made it, and once more we ought to pray"
957,JUST FOLKS,For the brave and loyal mother of the boy who goes away.
958,JUST FOLKS,
959,JUST FOLKS,There are days of grief before her; there are hours that she will weep;
960,JUST FOLKS,There are nights of anxious waiting when her fear will banish sleep;
961,JUST FOLKS,"She has heard her country calling and has risen to the test,"
962,JUST FOLKS,"And has placed upon the altar of the nation's need, her best."
963,JUST FOLKS,And no man shall ever suffer in the turmoil of the fray
964,JUST FOLKS,The anguish of the mother of the boy who goes away.
965,JUST FOLKS,
966,JUST FOLKS,"You may boast men's deeds of glory, you may tell their courage great,"
967,JUST FOLKS,"But to die is easier service than alone to sit and wait,"
968,JUST FOLKS,"And I hail the little mother, with the tear-stained face and grave,"
969,JUST FOLKS,Who has given the flag a soldier--she's the bravest of the brave.
970,JUST FOLKS,"And that banner we are proud of, with its red and blue and white,"
971,JUST FOLKS,Is a lasting holy tribute to all mothers' love of right.

978,JUST FOLKS,The finest tribute we can pay
979,JUST FOLKS,"Unto our hero dead to-day,"
980,JUST FOLKS,"Is not a rose wreath, white and red,"
981,JUST FOLKS,In memory of the blood they shed;
982,JUST FOLKS,"It is to stand beside each mound,"
983,JUST FOLKS,"Each couch of consecrated ground,"
984,JUST FOLKS,And pledge ourselves as warriors true
985,JUST FOLKS,Unto the work they died to do.
986,JUST FOLKS,
987,JUST FOLKS,Into God's valleys where they lie
988,JUST FOLKS,"At rest, beneath the open sky,"
989,JUST FOLKS,"Triumphant now o'er every foe,"
990,JUST FOLKS,As living tributes let us go.
991,JUST FOLKS,No wreath of rose or immortelles
992,JUST FOLKS,Or spoken word or tolling bells
993,JUST FOLKS,"Will do to-day, unless we give"
994,JUST FOLKS,Our pledge that liberty shall live.
995,JUST FOLKS,
996,JUST FOLKS,Our hearts must be the roses red
997,JUST FOLKS,We place above our hero dead;
998,JUST FOLKS,To-day beside their graves we must
999,JUST FOLKS,Renew allegiance to their trust;
1000,JUST FOLKS,Must bare our heads and humbly say
1001,JUST FOLKS,"We hold the Flag as dear as they,"
1002,JUST FOLKS,"And stand, as once they stood, to die"
1003,JUST FOLKS,To keep the Stars and Stripes on high.
1004,JUST FOLKS,
1005,JUST FOLKS,The finest tribute we can pay
1006,JUST FOLKS,Unto our hero dead to-day
1007,JUST FOLKS,"Is not of speech or roses red,"
1008,JUST FOLKS,"But living, throbbing hearts instead,"
1009,JUST FOLKS,That shall renew the pledge they sealed
1010,JUST FOLKS,With death upon the battlefield:
1011,JUST FOLKS,That freedom's flag shall bear no stain
1012,JUST FOLKS,And free men wear no tyrant's chain.

1018,JUST FOLKS,
1019,JUST FOLKS,"I stood and watched him playing,"
1020,JUST FOLKS,"A little lad of three,"
1021,JUST FOLKS,And back to me came straying
1022,JUST FOLKS,The years that used to be;
1023,JUST FOLKS,In him the boy was Maying
1024,JUST FOLKS,Who once belonged to me.
1025,JUST FOLKS,
1026,JUST FOLKS,The selfsame brown his eyes were
1027,JUST FOLKS,As those that once I knew;
1028,JUST FOLKS,"As glad and gay his cries were,"
1029,JUST FOLKS,"He owned his laughter, too."
1030,JUST FOLKS,"His features, form and size were"
1031,JUST FOLKS,"My baby's, through and through."
1032,JUST FOLKS,
1033,JUST FOLKS,His ears were those I'd sung to;
1034,JUST FOLKS,His chubby little hands
1035,JUST FOLKS,Were those that I had clung to;
1036,JUST FOLKS,His hair in golden strands
1037,JUST FOLKS,It seemed my heart was strung to
1038,JUST FOLKS,By love's unbroken bands.
1039,JUST FOLKS,
1040,JUST FOLKS,With him I lived the old days
1041,JUST FOLKS,That seem so far away;
1042,JUST FOLKS,The beautiful and bold days
1043,JUST FOLKS,When he was here to play;
1044,JUST FOLKS,The sunny and the gold days
1045,JUST FOLKS,Of that remembered May.
1046,JUST FOLKS,
1047,JUST FOLKS,I know not who he may be
1048,JUST FOLKS,"Nor where his home may be,"
1049,JUST FOLKS,But I shall every day be
1050,JUST FOLKS,In hope again to see
1051,JUST FOLKS,The image of the baby
1052,JUST FOLKS,Who once belonged to me.

1057,JUST FOLKS,The Stick-Together Families
1058,JUST FOLKS,
1059,JUST FOLKS,The stick-together families are happier by far
1060,JUST FOLKS,Than the brothers and the sisters who take separate highways are.
1061,JUST FOLKS,The gladdest people living are the wholesome folks who make
1062,JUST FOLKS,A circle at the fireside that no power but death can break.
1063,JUST FOLKS,And the finest of conventions ever held beneath the sun
1064,JUST FOLKS,Are the little family gatherings when the busy day is done.
1065,JUST FOLKS,
1066,JUST FOLKS,"There are rich folk, there are poor folk, who imagine they are wise,"
1067,JUST FOLKS,And they're very quick to shatter all the little family ties.
1068,JUST FOLKS,"Each goes searching after pleasure in his own selected way,"
1069,JUST FOLKS,"Each with strangers likes to wander, and with strangers likes to play."
1070,JUST FOLKS,"But it's bitterness they harvest, and it's empty joy they find,"
1071,JUST FOLKS,For the children that are wisest are the stick-together kind.
1072,JUST FOLKS,
1073,JUST FOLKS,"There are some who seem to fancy that for gladness they must roam,"
1074,JUST FOLKS,That for smiles that are the brightest they must wander far from home.
1075,JUST FOLKS,"That the strange friend is the true friend, and they travel far astray"
1076,JUST FOLKS,"they waste their lives in striving for a joy that's far away,"
1077,JUST FOLKS,"But the gladdest sort of people, when the busy day is done,"
1078,JUST FOLKS,Are the brothers and the sisters who together share their fun.
1079,JUST FOLKS,
1080,JUST FOLKS,"It's the stick-together family that wins the joys of earth,"
1081,JUST FOLKS,That hears the sweetest music and that finds the finest mirth;
1082,JUST FOLKS,It's the old home roof that shelters all the charm that life can give;
1083,JUST FOLKS,"There you find the gladdest play-ground, there the happiest spot to live."
1084,JUST FOLKS,"And, O weary, wandering brother, if contentment you would win,"
1085,JUST FOLKS,Come you back unto the fireside and be comrade with your kin.
1086,JUST FOLKS,
1087,JUST FOLKS,
1088,JUST FOLKS,
1089,JUST FOLKS,
1090,JUST FOLKS,Childless
1091,JUST FOLKS,
1092,JUST FOLKS,If certain folks that I know well
1093,JUST FOLKS,Should come to me their woes to tell
1094,JUST FOLKS,I'd read the sorrow in their faces
1095,JUST FOLKS,And I could analyze their cases.
1096,JUST FOLKS,I watch some couples day by day
1097,JUST FOLKS,Go madly on their selfish way
1098,JUST FOLKS,Forever seeking happiness
1099,JUST FOLKS,And always finding something less.
1100,JUST FOLKS,"If she whose face is fair to see,"
1101,JUST FOLKS,"Yet lacks one charm that there should be,"
1102,JUST FOLKS,Should open wide her heart to-day
1103,JUST FOLKS,I think I know what she would say.
1104,JUST FOLKS,
1105,JUST FOLKS,She'd tell me that his love seems cold
1106,JUST FOLKS,And not the love she knew of old;
1107,JUST FOLKS,That for the home they've built to share
1108,JUST FOLKS,No longer does her husband care;
1109,JUST FOLKS,That he seems happier away
1110,JUST FOLKS,"Than by her side, and every day"
1111,JUST FOLKS,That passes leaves them more apart;
1112,JUST FOLKS,And then perhaps her tears would start
1113,JUST FOLKS,And in a softened voice she'd add:
1114,JUST FOLKS,"""Sometimes I wonder, if we had"
1115,JUST FOLKS,"A baby now to love, if he"
1116,JUST FOLKS,"Would find so many faults in me?"""
1117,JUST FOLKS,
1118,JUST FOLKS,And if he came to tell his woe
1119,JUST FOLKS,"Just what he'd say to me, I know:"
1120,JUST FOLKS,"""There's something dismal in the place"
1121,JUST FOLKS,That always stares me in the face.
1122,JUST FOLKS,I love her. She is good and sweet
1123,JUST FOLKS,But still my joy is incomplete.
1124,JUST FOLKS,And then it seems to me that she
1125,JUST FOLKS,Can only see the faults in me.
1126,JUST FOLKS,I wonder sometimes if we had
1127,JUST FOLKS,"A little girl or little lad,"
1128,JUST FOLKS,If life with all its fret and fuss
1129,JUST FOLKS,"Would then seem so monotonous?"""
1130,JUST FOLKS,
1131,JUST FOLKS,And what I'd say to them I know.
1132,JUST FOLKS,I'd bid them straightway forth to go
1133,JUST FOLKS,And find that child and take him in
1134,JUST FOLKS,And start the joy of life to win.
1135,JUST FOLKS,"You foolish, hungry souls, I'd say,"
1136,JUST FOLKS,You're living in a selfish way.
1137,JUST FOLKS,A baby's arms stretched out to you
1138,JUST FOLKS,Will give you something real to do.
1139,JUST FOLKS,And though God has not sent one down
1140,JUST FOLKS,"To you, within this very town"
1141,JUST FOLKS,Somewhere a little baby lies
1142,JUST FOLKS,That would bring gladness to your eyes.
1143,JUST FOLKS,
1144,JUST FOLKS,You cannot live this life for gold
1145,JUST FOLKS,Or selfish joys. As you grow old
1146,JUST FOLKS,You'll find that comfort only springs
1147,JUST FOLKS,From living for the living things.
1148,JUST FOLKS,And home must be a barren place
1149,JUST FOLKS,That never knows a baby's face.
1150,JUST FOLKS,"Take in a child that needs your care,"
1151,JUST FOLKS,Give him your name and let him share
1152,JUST FOLKS,Your happiness and you will own
1153,JUST FOLKS,"More joy than you have ever known,"
1154,JUST FOLKS,"And, what is more, you'll come to feel"
1155,JUST FOLKS,That you are doing something real.

1160,JUST FOLKS,The Crucible of Life
1161,JUST FOLKS,
1162,JUST FOLKS,"Sunshine and shadow, blue sky and gray,"
1163,JUST FOLKS,Laughter and tears as we tread on our way;
1164,JUST FOLKS,"Hearts that are heavy, then hearts that are light,"
1165,JUST FOLKS,Eyes that are misty and eyes that are bright;
1166,JUST FOLKS,"Losses and gains in the heat of the strife,"
1167,JUST FOLKS,Each in proportion to round out his life.
1168,JUST FOLKS,
1169,JUST FOLKS,"Into the crucible, stirred by the years,"
1170,JUST FOLKS,Go all our hopes and misgivings and fears;
1171,JUST FOLKS,"Glad days and sad days, our pleasures and pains,"
1172,JUST FOLKS,"Worries and comforts, our losses and gains."
1173,JUST FOLKS,Out of the crucible shall there not come
1174,JUST FOLKS,Joy undefiled when we pour off the scum?
1175,JUST FOLKS,
1176,JUST FOLKS,"Out of the sadness and anguish and woe,"
1177,JUST FOLKS,"Out of the travail and burdens we know,"
1178,JUST FOLKS,"Out of the shadow that darkens the way,"
1179,JUST FOLKS,"Out of the failure that tries us to-day,"
1180,JUST FOLKS,Have you a doubt that contentment will come
1181,JUST FOLKS,When you've purified life and discarded the scum?
1182,JUST FOLKS,
1183,JUST FOLKS,"Tinctured with sorrow and flavored with sighs,"
1184,JUST FOLKS,Moistened with tears that have flowed from your eyes;
1185,JUST FOLKS,"Perfumed with sweetness of loves that have died,"
1186,JUST FOLKS,"Leavened with failures, with grief sanctified,"
1187,JUST FOLKS,Sacred and sweet is the joy that must come
1188,JUST FOLKS,From the furnace of life when you've poured off the scum.

1194,JUST FOLKS,
1195,JUST FOLKS,"If he is honest, kindly, true,"
1196,JUST FOLKS,And glad to work from day to day;
1197,JUST FOLKS,If when his bit of toil is through
1198,JUST FOLKS,With children he will stoop to play;
1199,JUST FOLKS,If he does always what he can
1200,JUST FOLKS,"To serve another's time of need,"
1201,JUST FOLKS,Then I shall hail him as a man
1202,JUST FOLKS,And never ask him what's his creed.
1203,JUST FOLKS,
1204,JUST FOLKS,If he respects a woman's name
1205,JUST FOLKS,And guards her from all thoughtless jeers;
1206,JUST FOLKS,If he is glad to play life's game
1207,JUST FOLKS,And not risk all to get the cheers;
1208,JUST FOLKS,If he disdains to win by bluff
1209,JUST FOLKS,"And scorns to gain by shady tricks,"
1210,JUST FOLKS,I hold that he is good enough
1211,JUST FOLKS,Regardless of his politics.
1212,JUST FOLKS,
1213,JUST FOLKS,If he is glad his much to share
1214,JUST FOLKS,"With them who little here possess,"
1215,JUST FOLKS,If he will stand by what is fair
1216,JUST FOLKS,"And not desert to claim success,"
1217,JUST FOLKS,If he will leave a smile behind
1218,JUST FOLKS,"As he proceeds from place to place,"
1219,JUST FOLKS,"He has the proper frame of mind,"
1220,JUST FOLKS,And I won't stop to ask his race.
1221,JUST FOLKS,
1222,JUST FOLKS,For when at last life's battle ends
1223,JUST FOLKS,And all the troops are called on high
1224,JUST FOLKS,We shall discover many friends
1225,JUST FOLKS,That thoughtlessly we journeyed by.
1226,JUST FOLKS,And we shall learn that God above
1227,JUST FOLKS,"Has judged His creatures by their deeds,"
1228,JUST FOLKS,That millions there have won His love
1229,JUST FOLKS,Who spoke in different tongues and creeds.

1232,JUST FOLKS,
1233,JUST FOLKS,"You may talk of stylish raiment,"
1234,JUST FOLKS,"You may boast your broadcloth fine,"
1235,JUST FOLKS,And the price you gave in payment
1236,JUST FOLKS,May be treble that of mine.
1237,JUST FOLKS,But there's one suit I'd not trade you
1238,JUST FOLKS,"Though it's shabby and it's thin,"
1239,JUST FOLKS,For the garb your tailor made you:
1240,JUST FOLKS,"That's the tattered,"
1241,JUST FOLKS,Mud-bespattered
1242,JUST FOLKS,Suit that I go fishing in.
1243,JUST FOLKS,
1244,JUST FOLKS,There's no king in silks and laces
1245,JUST FOLKS,"And with jewels on his breast,"
1246,JUST FOLKS,With whom I would alter places.
1247,JUST FOLKS,There's no man so richly dressed
1248,JUST FOLKS,Or so like a fashion panel
1249,JUST FOLKS,"That, his luxuries to win,"
1250,JUST FOLKS,I would swap my shirt of flannel
1251,JUST FOLKS,"And the rusty,"
1252,JUST FOLKS,Frayed and dusty
1253,JUST FOLKS,Suit that I go fishing in.
1254,JUST FOLKS,
1255,JUST FOLKS,'Tis an outfit meant for pleasure;
1256,JUST FOLKS,"It is freedom's raiment, too;"
1257,JUST FOLKS,It's a garb that I shall treasure
1258,JUST FOLKS,Till my time of life is through.
1259,JUST FOLKS,Though perhaps it looks the saddest
1260,JUST FOLKS,"Of all robes for mortal skin,"
1261,JUST FOLKS,I am proudest and I'm gladdest
1262,JUST FOLKS,"In that easy,"
1263,JUST FOLKS,Old and greasy
1264,JUST FOLKS,Suit that I go fishing in.

1273,JUST FOLKS,"A saddle horse that gayly rocks,"
1274,JUST FOLKS,And games for little boys.
1275,JUST FOLKS,But now he's big and all that stuff
1276,JUST FOLKS,His whim no longer suits;
1277,JUST FOLKS,He tells us that he's old enough
1278,JUST FOLKS,To ask for rubber boots.
1279,JUST FOLKS,
1280,JUST FOLKS,Last year whatever Santa brought
1281,JUST FOLKS,Delighted him to own;
1282,JUST FOLKS,He never gave his wants a thought
1283,JUST FOLKS,Nor made his wishes known.
1284,JUST FOLKS,"But now he says he wants a gun,"
1285,JUST FOLKS,"The kind that really shoots,"
1286,JUST FOLKS,And I'm confronted with a son
1287,JUST FOLKS,Demanding rubber boots.
1288,JUST FOLKS,
1289,JUST FOLKS,The baby that we used to know
1290,JUST FOLKS,"Has somehow slipped away,"
1291,JUST FOLKS,And when or where he chanced to go
1292,JUST FOLKS,Not one of us can say.
1293,JUST FOLKS,But here's a helter-skelter lad
1294,JUST FOLKS,That to me nightly scoots
1295,JUST FOLKS,And boldly wishes that he had
1296,JUST FOLKS,A pair of rubber boots.
1297,JUST FOLKS,
1298,JUST FOLKS,I'll bet old Santa Claus will sigh
1299,JUST FOLKS,"When down our flue he comes,"
1300,JUST FOLKS,And seeks the babe that used to lie
1301,JUST FOLKS,"And suck his tiny thumbs,"
1302,JUST FOLKS,And finds within that little bed
1303,JUST FOLKS,A grown up boy who hoots
1304,JUST FOLKS,"At building blocks, and wants instead"
1305,JUST FOLKS,A pair of rubber boots.

1310,JUST FOLKS,Departed Friends
1311,JUST FOLKS,
1312,JUST FOLKS,The dead friends live and always will;
1313,JUST FOLKS,Their presence hovers round us still.
1314,JUST FOLKS,It seems to me they come to share
1315,JUST FOLKS,Each joy or sorrow that we bear.
1316,JUST FOLKS,Among the living I can feel
1317,JUST FOLKS,"The sweet departed spirits steal,"
1318,JUST FOLKS,"And whether it be weal or woe,"
1319,JUST FOLKS,I walk with those I used to know.
1320,JUST FOLKS,I can recall them to my side
1321,JUST FOLKS,Whenever I am struggle-tried;
1322,JUST FOLKS,"I've but to wish for them, and they"
1323,JUST FOLKS,"Come trooping gayly down the way,"
1324,JUST FOLKS,And I can tell to them my grief
1325,JUST FOLKS,And from their presence find relief.
1326,JUST FOLKS,In sacred memories below
1327,JUST FOLKS,Still live the friends of long ago.

1331,JUST FOLKS,
1332,JUST FOLKS,Laughter
1333,JUST FOLKS,
1334,JUST FOLKS,Laughter sort o' settles breakfast better than digestive pills;
1335,JUST FOLKS,"Found it, somehow in my travels, cure for every sort of ills;"
1336,JUST FOLKS,"When the hired help have riled me with their slipshod, careless ways,"
1337,JUST FOLKS,"An' I'm bilin' mad an' cussin' an' my temper's all ablaze,"
1338,JUST FOLKS,If the calf gets me to laughin' while they're teachin' him to feed
1339,JUST FOLKS,"Pretty soon I'm feelin' better, 'cause I've found the cure I need."
1340,JUST FOLKS,
1341,JUST FOLKS,"Like to start the day with laughter; when I've had a peaceful night,"
1342,JUST FOLKS,"An' can greet the sun all smilin', that day's goin' to be all right."
1343,JUST FOLKS,"But there's nothing goes to suit me, when my system's full of bile;"

1345,JUST FOLKS,"But they'll buckle to the traces when they hear a glad giddap,"
1346,JUST FOLKS,Just as though they like to labor for a cheerful kind o' chap.
1347,JUST FOLKS,
1348,JUST FOLKS,"Laughter keeps me strong an' healthy. You can bet I'm all run down,"
1349,JUST FOLKS,Fit for doctor folks an' nurses when I cannot shake my frown.
1350,JUST FOLKS,"Found in farmin' laughter's useful, good for sheep an' cows an' goats;"

1352,JUST FOLKS,"Laughter's good for any business, leastwise so it seems to me"
1353,JUST FOLKS,Never knew a smilin' feller but was busy as could be.
1354,JUST FOLKS,

1357,JUST FOLKS,Then I come to this conclusion--take it now for what it's worth
1358,JUST FOLKS,It's the joy of laughter keeps us plodding on this stretch of earth.
1359,JUST FOLKS,Men the fun o' life are seeking--that's the reason for the calf
1360,JUST FOLKS,Spillin' mash upon his keeper--men are hungry for a laugh.

1366,JUST FOLKS,
1367,JUST FOLKS,"If I had lived in Franklin's time I'm most afraid that I,"
1368,JUST FOLKS,"Beholding him out in the rain, a kite about to fly,"
1369,JUST FOLKS,"And noticing upon its tail the barn door's rusty key,"
1370,JUST FOLKS,"Would, with the scoffers on the street, have chortled in my glee;"
1371,JUST FOLKS,"And with a sneer upon my lips I would have said of Ben,"
1372,JUST FOLKS,"""His belfry must be full of bats. He's raving, boys, again!"""
1373,JUST FOLKS,
1374,JUST FOLKS,"I'm glad I didn't live on earth when Fulton had his dream,"
1375,JUST FOLKS,"And told his neighbors marvelous tales of what he'd do with steam,"

1378,JUST FOLKS,"At ""Fulton's Folly"" I'd have sneered, as thousands did back then,"
1379,JUST FOLKS,And called the Clermont's architect the craziest of men.
1380,JUST FOLKS,
1381,JUST FOLKS,"Yet Franklin gave us wonders great and Fulton did the same,"
1382,JUST FOLKS,"And many ""boobs"" have left behind an everlasting fame."
1383,JUST FOLKS,And dead are all their scoffers now and all their sneers forgot
1384,JUST FOLKS,And scarce a nickel's worth of good was brought here by the lot.
1385,JUST FOLKS,"I shudder when I stop to think, had I been living then,"
1386,JUST FOLKS,"I might have been a scoffer, too, and jeered at Bob and Ben."

1405,JUST FOLKS,The pathway of the living we can beautify and grace;

1427,JUST FOLKS,When she makes a lemon pie.

1432,JUST FOLKS,"On the plate, my heart grows bold"
1433,JUST FOLKS,And the kids and I in chorus
1434,JUST FOLKS,Raise one glad exultant cry
1435,JUST FOLKS,And we cheer the treat before us
1436,JUST FOLKS,Which is mother's lemon pie.
1437,JUST FOLKS,
1438,JUST FOLKS,"Then the little troubles vanish,"

1442,JUST FOLKS,And we smack our lips in pleasure
1443,JUST FOLKS,"O'er a joy no coin can buy,"

1452,JUST FOLKS,We've raised a flagpole on the farm
1453,JUST FOLKS,"And flung Old Glory to the sky,"
1454,JUST FOLKS,And it's another touch of charm
1455,JUST FOLKS,"That seems to cheer the passer-by,"
1456,JUST FOLKS,"But more than that, no matter where"
1457,JUST FOLKS,"We're laboring in wood and field,"
1458,JUST FOLKS,"We turn and see it in the air,"
1459,JUST FOLKS,Our promise of a greater yield.
1460,JUST FOLKS,"It whispers to us all day long,"
1461,JUST FOLKS,"From dawn to dusk: ""Be true, be strong;"
1462,JUST FOLKS,Who falters now with plow or hoe
1463,JUST FOLKS,"Gives comfort to his country's foe."""
1464,JUST FOLKS,
1465,JUST FOLKS,It seems to me I've never tried
1466,JUST FOLKS,"To do so much about the place,"
1467,JUST FOLKS,"Nor been so slow to come inside,"
1468,JUST FOLKS,"But since I've got the flag to face,"
1469,JUST FOLKS,Each night when I come home to rest
1470,JUST FOLKS,I feel that I must look up there
1471,JUST FOLKS,"And say: ""Old Flag, I've done my best,"

1473,JUST FOLKS,"And sometimes, just to catch the breeze,"
1474,JUST FOLKS,"I stop my work, and o'er the trees"
1475,JUST FOLKS,Old Glory fairly shouts my way:
1476,JUST FOLKS,"""You're shirking far too much to-day!"""
1477,JUST FOLKS,
1478,JUST FOLKS,"The help have caught the spirit, too;"
1479,JUST FOLKS,The hired man takes off his cap
1480,JUST FOLKS,"Before the old red, white and blue,"
1481,JUST FOLKS,"Then to the horses says: ""giddap!"""
1482,JUST FOLKS,And starting bravely to the field
1483,JUST FOLKS,He tells the milkmaid by the door:
1484,JUST FOLKS,"""We're going to make these acres yield"
1485,JUST FOLKS,"More than they've ever done before."""
1486,JUST FOLKS,"She smiles to hear his gallant brag,"
1487,JUST FOLKS,Then drops a curtsey to the flag.
1488,JUST FOLKS,And in her eyes there seems to shine
1489,JUST FOLKS,A patriotism that is fine.
1490,JUST FOLKS,
1491,JUST FOLKS,We've raised a flagpole on the farm
1492,JUST FOLKS,And flung Old Glory to the sky;

1494,JUST FOLKS,But courage here is running high.
1495,JUST FOLKS,We're doing things we never dreamed
1496,JUST FOLKS,We'd ever find the time to do;
1497,JUST FOLKS,Deeds that impossible once seemed
1498,JUST FOLKS,Each morning now we hurry through.
1499,JUST FOLKS,The flag now waves above our toil
1500,JUST FOLKS,"And sheds its glory on the soil,"
1501,JUST FOLKS,And boy and man looks up to it
1502,JUST FOLKS,"As if to say: ""I'll do my bit!"""

1511,JUST FOLKS,There are heroes known to glory that were not afraid to die
1512,JUST FOLKS,In the service of their country and to keep the flag on high;
1513,JUST FOLKS,"There are brave men in the trenches, there are brave men on the sea,"
1514,JUST FOLKS,"But the silent, quiet heroes also prove their bravery."
1515,JUST FOLKS,
1516,JUST FOLKS,"I am thinking of a hero that was never known to fame,"
1517,JUST FOLKS,Just a manly little fellow with a very common name;
1518,JUST FOLKS,"He was freckle-faced and ruddy, but his head was nobly shaped,"
1519,JUST FOLKS,And he one day took the whipping that his comrades all escaped.
1520,JUST FOLKS,"And he never made a murmur, never whimpered in reply;"
1521,JUST FOLKS,He would rather take the censure than to stand and tell a lie.
1522,JUST FOLKS,
1523,JUST FOLKS,"And I'm thinking of another that had courage that was fine,"
1524,JUST FOLKS,And I've often wished in moments that such strength of will were mine.
1525,JUST FOLKS,"He stood against his comrades, and he left them then and there"
1526,JUST FOLKS,When they wanted him to join them in a deed that wasn't fair.
1527,JUST FOLKS,"He stood alone, undaunted, with his little head erect;"
1528,JUST FOLKS,He would rather take the jeering than to lose his self-respect.
1529,JUST FOLKS,
1530,JUST FOLKS,"And I know a lot of others that have grown to manhood now,"
1531,JUST FOLKS,Who have yet to wear the laurel that adorns the victor's brow.
1532,JUST FOLKS,"They have plodded on in honor through the dusty, dreary ways,"
1533,JUST FOLKS,"They have hungered for life's comforts and the joys of easy days,"
1534,JUST FOLKS,"But they've chosen to be toilers, and in this their splendor's told:"

1544,JUST FOLKS,"She used to stand by the window pane,"
1545,JUST FOLKS,Worried and troubled as she could be.
1546,JUST FOLKS,"And this was the question I used to hear,"
1547,JUST FOLKS,The very minute that I drew near;

1549,JUST FOLKS,"""Tell me, my boy, if your feet are wet."""
1550,JUST FOLKS,
1551,JUST FOLKS,"Worried about me was mother dear,"
1552,JUST FOLKS,As healthy a lad as ever strolled
1553,JUST FOLKS,"Over a turnpike, far or near,"
1554,JUST FOLKS,'Fraid to death that I'd take a cold.
1555,JUST FOLKS,"Always stood by the window pane,"
1556,JUST FOLKS,Watching for me in the pouring rain;

1559,JUST FOLKS,
1560,JUST FOLKS,"Stockings warmed by the kitchen fire,"

1563,JUST FOLKS,"Giving her boy the best of care,"
1564,JUST FOLKS,"Thinking of him the long day through,"
1565,JUST FOLKS,In the worried way that all mothers do;
1566,JUST FOLKS,"Whenever it rained she'd start to fret,"
1567,JUST FOLKS,Always fearing my feet were wet.
1568,JUST FOLKS,
1569,JUST FOLKS,"And now, whenever it rains, I see"
1570,JUST FOLKS,"A vision of mother in days of yore,"
1571,JUST FOLKS,"Still waiting there to welcome me,"
1572,JUST FOLKS,As she used to do by the open door.
1573,JUST FOLKS,And always I think as I enter there

1590,JUST FOLKS,The days of the blue flannel shirt.
1591,JUST FOLKS,
1592,JUST FOLKS,I want to get out in the country
1593,JUST FOLKS,And rest by the side of the lake;
1594,JUST FOLKS,"To go a few days without shaving,"
1595,JUST FOLKS,And give grim old custom the shake.
1596,JUST FOLKS,"A week's growth of whiskers, I'm thinking,"

1618,JUST FOLKS,"You pull along the ground with strings,"
1619,JUST FOLKS,"And he knows all the names of birds,"
1620,JUST FOLKS,"And how they call 'thout using words,"
1621,JUST FOLKS,"And where they live and what they eat,"
1622,JUST FOLKS,And how they build their nests so neat.
1623,JUST FOLKS,He's lots of fun! Sometimes all day

1625,JUST FOLKS,"You see he's getting old, and so"
1626,JUST FOLKS,"To work he doesn't have to go,"

1655,JUST FOLKS,It is a father's place to show
1656,JUST FOLKS,"The young the way that they should go,"

1663,JUST FOLKS,And do as all the grandpas do.
1664,JUST FOLKS,I'll buy my daughter's children things
1665,JUST FOLKS,"Like horns and drums and tops with strings,"

1667,JUST FOLKS,And frogs and fish and birds and bees
1668,JUST FOLKS,And fairies in the shady glen
1669,JUST FOLKS,"And tales of giants, too, and when"
1670,JUST FOLKS,"They beg of me for just one more,"
1671,JUST FOLKS,I'll take them to the candy store;

1686,JUST FOLKS,
1687,JUST FOLKS,The automobile that I got that ran around the floor
1688,JUST FOLKS,"Was lots of fun when it was new, but it won't go no more."
1689,JUST FOLKS,"Pa wound it up for Uncle Jim to show him how it went,"
1690,JUST FOLKS,"And when those two got through with it the runnin' gear was bent,"
1691,JUST FOLKS,"An' now it doesn't go at all. I mustn't grumble though,"
1692,JUST FOLKS,'Cause while it was in shape to run my pa enjoyed it so.
1693,JUST FOLKS,
1694,JUST FOLKS,"I've got my blocks as good as new, my mitts are perfect yet;"
1695,JUST FOLKS,Although the snow is on the ground I haven't got em wet.
1696,JUST FOLKS,"I've taken care of everything that Santa brought to me,"
1697,JUST FOLKS,Except the toys that run about when wound up with a key.
1698,JUST FOLKS,But next year you can bet I won't make any such mistake;

1739,JUST FOLKS,"Have never a reason to doubt him,"
1740,JUST FOLKS,Is he less successful than you?
1741,JUST FOLKS,
1742,JUST FOLKS,"You think that the failures are many,"
1743,JUST FOLKS,You judge by men's profits in gold;
1744,JUST FOLKS,You judge by the rule of the penny--
1745,JUST FOLKS,In this true success isn't told.
1746,JUST FOLKS,"This falsely man's story is telling,"
1747,JUST FOLKS,"For wealth often brings on distress,"
1748,JUST FOLKS,"But wherever love brightens a dwelling,"
1749,JUST FOLKS,"There lives; rich or poor, a success."

1754,JUST FOLKS,The Sorry Hostess
1755,JUST FOLKS,
1756,JUST FOLKS,She said she was sorry the weather was bad
1757,JUST FOLKS,The night that she asked us to dine;
1758,JUST FOLKS,And she really appeared inexpressibly sad
1759,JUST FOLKS,Because she had hoped 'twould be fine.
1760,JUST FOLKS,"She was sorry to hear that my wife had a cold,"
1761,JUST FOLKS,"And she almost shed tears over that,"
1762,JUST FOLKS,"And how sorry she was, she most feelingly told,"
1763,JUST FOLKS,That the steam wasn't on in the flat.
1764,JUST FOLKS,
1765,JUST FOLKS,"She was sorry she hadn't asked others to come,"
1766,JUST FOLKS,She might just as well have had eight;
1767,JUST FOLKS,She said she was downcast and terribly glum
1768,JUST FOLKS,Because her dear husband was late.
1769,JUST FOLKS,"She apologized then for the home she was in,"
1770,JUST FOLKS,"For the state of the rugs and the chairs,"
1771,JUST FOLKS,"For the children who made such a horrible din,"
1772,JUST FOLKS,And then for the squeak in the stairs.
1773,JUST FOLKS,
1774,JUST FOLKS,When the dinner began she apologized twice
1775,JUST FOLKS,"For the olives, because they were small;"
1776,JUST FOLKS,"She was certain the celery, too, wasn't nice,"
1777,JUST FOLKS,And the soup didn't suit her at all.
1778,JUST FOLKS,She was sorry she couldn't get whitefish instead
1779,JUST FOLKS,"Of the trout that the fishmonger sent,"
1780,JUST FOLKS,"But she hoped that we'd manage somehow to be fed,"
1781,JUST FOLKS,Though her dinner was not what she meant.
1782,JUST FOLKS,
1783,JUST FOLKS,"She spoke her regrets for the salad, and then"
1784,JUST FOLKS,"Explained she was really much hurt,"
1785,JUST FOLKS,And begged both our pardons again and again
1786,JUST FOLKS,For serving a skimpy dessert.
1787,JUST FOLKS,"She was sorry for this and sorry for that,"
1788,JUST FOLKS,Though there really was nothing to blame.
1789,JUST FOLKS,"But I thought to myself as I put on my hat,"
1790,JUST FOLKS,Perhaps she is sorry we came.

1794,JUST FOLKS,
1795,JUST FOLKS,Yesterday
1796,JUST FOLKS,
1797,JUST FOLKS,"I've trod the links with many a man,"
1798,JUST FOLKS,And played him club for club;
1799,JUST FOLKS,'Tis scarce a year since I began
1800,JUST FOLKS,And I am still a dub.
1801,JUST FOLKS,But this I've noticed as we strayed
1802,JUST FOLKS,"Along the bunkered way,"
1803,JUST FOLKS,No one with me has ever played
1804,JUST FOLKS,As he did yesterday.
1805,JUST FOLKS,
1806,JUST FOLKS,"It makes no difference what the drive,"
1807,JUST FOLKS,"Together as we walk,"
1808,JUST FOLKS,"Till we up to the ball arrive,"
1809,JUST FOLKS,I get the same old talk:
1810,JUST FOLKS,"""To-day there's something wrong with me,"
1811,JUST FOLKS,Just what I cannot say.
1812,JUST FOLKS,
1813,JUST FOLKS,"""Would you believe I got a three"
1814,JUST FOLKS,"For this hole--yesterday?"""
1815,JUST FOLKS,"I see them top and slice a shot,"
1816,JUST FOLKS,"And fail to follow through,"
1817,JUST FOLKS,"And with their brassies plough the lot,"
1818,JUST FOLKS,The very way I do.
1819,JUST FOLKS,"To six and seven their figures run,"
1820,JUST FOLKS,And then they sadly say:
1821,JUST FOLKS,"""I neither dubbed, nor foozled one"
1822,JUST FOLKS,"When I played--yesterday."""
1823,JUST FOLKS,
1824,JUST FOLKS,"I have no yesterdays to count,"
1825,JUST FOLKS,No good work to recall;
1826,JUST FOLKS,"Each morning sees hope proudly mount,"
1827,JUST FOLKS,Each evening sees it fall.
1828,JUST FOLKS,"And in the locker room at night,"
1829,JUST FOLKS,"When men discuss their play,"
1830,JUST FOLKS,I hear them and I wish I might
1831,JUST FOLKS,"Have seen them--yesterday,"
1832,JUST FOLKS,
1833,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, dear old yesterday! What store"
1834,JUST FOLKS,Of joys for men you hold!
1835,JUST FOLKS,I'm sure there is no day that's more
1836,JUST FOLKS,Remembered or extolled.
1837,JUST FOLKS,"I'm off my task myself a bit,"
1838,JUST FOLKS,My mind has run astray;
1839,JUST FOLKS,"I think, perhaps, I should have writ"
1840,JUST FOLKS,These verses--yesterday.

1845,JUST FOLKS,The Beauty Places
1846,JUST FOLKS,
1847,JUST FOLKS,"Here she walked and romped about,"
1848,JUST FOLKS,And here beneath this apple tree
1849,JUST FOLKS,Where all the grass is trampled out
1850,JUST FOLKS,The swing she loved so used to be.
1851,JUST FOLKS,"This path is but a path to you,"
1852,JUST FOLKS,Because my child you never knew.
1853,JUST FOLKS,
1854,JUST FOLKS,'Twas here she used to stoop to smell
1855,JUST FOLKS,The first bright daffodil of spring;
1856,JUST FOLKS,'Twas here she often tripped and fell
1857,JUST FOLKS,And here she heard the robins sing.
1858,JUST FOLKS,"You'd call this but a common place,"
1859,JUST FOLKS,But you have never seen her face.
1860,JUST FOLKS,
1861,JUST FOLKS,And it was here we used to meet.
1862,JUST FOLKS,"How beautiful a spot is this,"
1863,JUST FOLKS,To which she gayly raced to greet
1864,JUST FOLKS,Her daddy with his evening kiss!
1865,JUST FOLKS,"You see here nothing grand or fine,"
1866,JUST FOLKS,"But, Oh, what memories are mine!"
1867,JUST FOLKS,
1868,JUST FOLKS,The people pass from day to day
1869,JUST FOLKS,And never turn their heads to see
1870,JUST FOLKS,The many charms along the way
1871,JUST FOLKS,That mean so very much to me.
1872,JUST FOLKS,For all things here are speaking of
1873,JUST FOLKS,The babe that once was mine to love.

1877,JUST FOLKS,
1878,JUST FOLKS,The Little Old Man
1879,JUST FOLKS,
1880,JUST FOLKS,The little old man with the curve in his back
1881,JUST FOLKS,"And the eyes that are dim and the skin that is slack,"
1882,JUST FOLKS,"So slack that it wrinkles and rolls on his cheeks,"
1883,JUST FOLKS,"With a thin little voice that goes ""crack!"" when he speaks,"
1884,JUST FOLKS,Never goes to the store but that right at his feet
1885,JUST FOLKS,Are all of the youngsters who live on the street.
1886,JUST FOLKS,
1887,JUST FOLKS,"And the little old man in the suit that was black,"
1888,JUST FOLKS,"And once might have perfectly fitted his back,"
1889,JUST FOLKS,"Has a boy's chubby fist in his own wrinkled hand,"
1890,JUST FOLKS,And together they trudge off to Light-Hearted Land;
1891,JUST FOLKS,Some splendid excursions he gives every day
1892,JUST FOLKS,To the boys and the girls in his funny old way.
1893,JUST FOLKS,
1894,JUST FOLKS,The little old man is as queer as can be;
1895,JUST FOLKS,He'd spend all his time with a child on his knee;
1896,JUST FOLKS,"And the stories he tells I could never repeat,"
1897,JUST FOLKS,But they're always of good boys and little girls sweet;
1898,JUST FOLKS,And the children come home at the end of the day
1899,JUST FOLKS,To tell what the little old man had to say.
1900,JUST FOLKS,
1901,JUST FOLKS,"Once the little old man didn't trudge to the store,"
1902,JUST FOLKS,And the tap of his cane wasn't heard any more;
1903,JUST FOLKS,The children looked eagerly for him each day
1904,JUST FOLKS,And wondered why he didn't come out to play
1905,JUST FOLKS,"Till some of them saw Doctor Brown ring his bell,"
1906,JUST FOLKS,And they wept when they heard that he might not get well.
1907,JUST FOLKS,
1908,JUST FOLKS,"But after awhile he got out with his cane,"
1909,JUST FOLKS,And called all the children around him again;
1910,JUST FOLKS,And I think as I see him go trudging along
1911,JUST FOLKS,"In the center, once more, of his light-hearted throng,"
1912,JUST FOLKS,That earth has no glory that's greater than this:
1913,JUST FOLKS,The little old man whom the children would miss.

1918,JUST FOLKS,The Little Velvet Suit
1919,JUST FOLKS,
1920,JUST FOLKS,"Last night I got to thinkin' of the pleasant long ago,"
1921,JUST FOLKS,"When I still had on knee breeches, an' I wore a flowing bow,"
1922,JUST FOLKS,"An' my Sunday suit was velvet. Ma an' Pa thought it was fine,"
1923,JUST FOLKS,But I know I didn't like it--either velvet or design;
1924,JUST FOLKS,"It was far too girlish for me, for I wanted something rough"
1925,JUST FOLKS,"Like what other boys were wearing, but Ma wouldn't buy such stuff."
1926,JUST FOLKS,
1927,JUST FOLKS,Ma answered all my protests in her sweet an kindly way;
1928,JUST FOLKS,"She said it didn't matter what I wore to run an' play,"
1929,JUST FOLKS,"But on Sundays when all people went to church an wore their best,"
1930,JUST FOLKS,Her boy must look as stylish an' as well kept as the rest.
1931,JUST FOLKS,"So she dressed me up in velvet, an' she tied the flowing bow,"
1932,JUST FOLKS,"An' she straightened out my stockings, so that not a crease would show."
1933,JUST FOLKS,
1934,JUST FOLKS,An' then I chuckled softly to myself while dreaming there
1935,JUST FOLKS,An' I saw her standing o'er me combing out my tangled hair.
1936,JUST FOLKS,"I could feel again the tugging, an' I heard the yell I gave"
1937,JUST FOLKS,"When she struck a snarl, an' softly I could hear her say: ""Be brave."
1938,JUST FOLKS,"'Twill be over in a minute, and a little man like you"
1939,JUST FOLKS,"Shouldn't whimper at a little bit of pain the way you do."""
1940,JUST FOLKS,
1941,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, I wouldn't mind the tugging at my scalp lock, and I know"
1942,JUST FOLKS,That I'd gladly wear to please her that old flowing girlish bow;
1943,JUST FOLKS,"And I think I'd even try to don once more that velvet suit,"
1944,JUST FOLKS,"And blush the same old blushes, as the women called me cute,"
1945,JUST FOLKS,"Could the dear old mother only take me by the hand again,"
1946,JUST FOLKS,And be as proud of me right now as she was always then.

1951,JUST FOLKS,The First Steps
1952,JUST FOLKS,
1953,JUST FOLKS,Last night I held my arms to you
1954,JUST FOLKS,And you held yours to mine
1955,JUST FOLKS,And started out to march to me
1956,JUST FOLKS,As any soldier fine.
1957,JUST FOLKS,You lifted up our little feet
1958,JUST FOLKS,And laughingly advanced;
1959,JUST FOLKS,And I stood there and gazed upon
1960,JUST FOLKS,"Your first wee steps, entranced."
1961,JUST FOLKS,
1962,JUST FOLKS,You gooed and gurgled as you came
1963,JUST FOLKS,Without a sign of fear;
1964,JUST FOLKS,"As though you knew, your journey o'er,"
1965,JUST FOLKS,I'd greet you with a cheer.
1966,JUST FOLKS,"And, what is more, you seemed to know,"
1967,JUST FOLKS,"Although you are so small,"
1968,JUST FOLKS,"That I was there, with eager arms,"
1969,JUST FOLKS,To save you from a fall.
1970,JUST FOLKS,
1971,JUST FOLKS,"Three tiny steps you took, and then,"
1972,JUST FOLKS,Disaster and dismay!
1973,JUST FOLKS,Your over-confidence had led
1974,JUST FOLKS,Your little feet astray.
1975,JUST FOLKS,You did not see what we could see
1976,JUST FOLKS,Nor fear what us alarms;
1977,JUST FOLKS,"You stumbled, but ere you could fall"
1978,JUST FOLKS,I caught you in my arms.
1979,JUST FOLKS,
1980,JUST FOLKS,"You little tyke, in days to come"
1981,JUST FOLKS,"You'll bravely walk alone,"
1982,JUST FOLKS,And you may have to wander paths
1983,JUST FOLKS,Where dangers lurk unknown.
1984,JUST FOLKS,"And, Oh, I pray that then, as now,"
1985,JUST FOLKS,When accidents befall
1986,JUST FOLKS,You'll still remember that I'm near
1987,JUST FOLKS,To save you from a fall.

1992,JUST FOLKS,Signs
1993,JUST FOLKS,
1994,JUST FOLKS,"It's ""be a good boy, Willie,"""
1995,JUST FOLKS,"And it's ""run away and play,"
1996,JUST FOLKS,For Santa Claus is coming
1997,JUST FOLKS,"With his reindeer and his sleigh."""
1998,JUST FOLKS,"It's ""mind what mother tells you,"""
1999,JUST FOLKS,"And it's ""put away your toys,"
2000,JUST FOLKS,For Santa Claus is coming
2001,JUST FOLKS,"To the good girls and the boys."""
2002,JUST FOLKS,"Ho, Santa Claus is coming, there is Christmas in the air,"
2003,JUST FOLKS,And little girls and little boys are good now everywhere.
2004,JUST FOLKS,
2005,JUST FOLKS,World-wide the little fellows
2006,JUST FOLKS,"Now are sweetly saying ""please,"""
2007,JUST FOLKS,"And ""thank you,"" and ""excuse me,"""
2008,JUST FOLKS,And those little pleasantries
2009,JUST FOLKS,That good children are supposed to
2010,JUST FOLKS,When there's company to hear;
2011,JUST FOLKS,And it's just as plain as can be
2012,JUST FOLKS,That the Christmas time is near.
2013,JUST FOLKS,"Ho, it's just as plain as can be that old Santa's on his way,"
2014,JUST FOLKS,For there are no little children that are really bad to-day.
2015,JUST FOLKS,
2016,JUST FOLKS,"And when evening shadows lengthen,"
2017,JUST FOLKS,Every little curly head
2018,JUST FOLKS,"Now is ready, aye, and willing"
2019,JUST FOLKS,To be tucked away in bed;
2020,JUST FOLKS,"Not one begs to stay up longer,"
2021,JUST FOLKS,Not one even sheds a tear;
2022,JUST FOLKS,"Ho, the goodness of the children"
2023,JUST FOLKS,Is a sign that Santa's near.
2024,JUST FOLKS,"It's wonderful, the goodness of the little tots to-day,"

2030,JUST FOLKS,The Family's Homely Man
2031,JUST FOLKS,
2032,JUST FOLKS,"There never was a family without its homely man,"
2033,JUST FOLKS,"With legs a little longer than the ordinary plan,"
2034,JUST FOLKS,"An' a shock of hair that brush an' comb can't ever straighten out,"
2035,JUST FOLKS,An' hands that somehow never seem to know what they're about;
2036,JUST FOLKS,The one with freckled features and a nose that looks as though
2037,JUST FOLKS,It was fashioned by the youngsters from a chunk of mother's dough.
2038,JUST FOLKS,"You know the man I'm thinking of, the homely one an' plain,"
2039,JUST FOLKS,That fairly oozes kindness like a rosebush dripping rain.
2040,JUST FOLKS,"His face is never much to see, but back of it there lies"
2041,JUST FOLKS,"A heap of love and tenderness and judgment, sound and wise."
2042,JUST FOLKS,
2043,JUST FOLKS,"And so I sing the homely man that's sittin' in his chair,"
2044,JUST FOLKS,And pray that every family will always have him there.
2045,JUST FOLKS,For looks don't count for much on earth; it's hearts that wear the gold;
2046,JUST FOLKS,"An' only that is ugly which is selfish, cruel, cold."
2047,JUST FOLKS,"The family needs him, Oh, so much; more, maybe, than they know;"
2048,JUST FOLKS,"Folks seldom guess a man's real worth until he has to go,"
2049,JUST FOLKS,But they will miss a heap of love an' tenderness the day
2050,JUST FOLKS,"God beckons to their homely man, an' he must go away."
2051,JUST FOLKS,
2052,JUST FOLKS,"He's found in every family, it doesn't matter where"
2053,JUST FOLKS,"They live or be they rich or poor, the homely man is there."
2054,JUST FOLKS,"You'll find him sitting quiet-like and sort of drawn apart,"
2055,JUST FOLKS,As though he felt he shouldn't be where folks are fine an' smart.
2056,JUST FOLKS,"He likes to hide himself away, a watcher of the fun,"
2057,JUST FOLKS,An' seldom takes a leading part when any game's begun.
2058,JUST FOLKS,"But when there's any task to do, like need for extra chairs,"
2059,JUST FOLKS,I've noticed it's the homely man that always climbs the stairs.
2060,JUST FOLKS,
2061,JUST FOLKS,And always it's the homely man that happens in to mend
2062,JUST FOLKS,"The little toys the youngsters break, for he's the children's friend."
2063,JUST FOLKS,"And he's the one that sits all night to watch beside the dead,"
2064,JUST FOLKS,And sends the worn-out sorrowers and broken hearts to bed.
2065,JUST FOLKS,"The family wouldn't be complete without him night or day,"
2066,JUST FOLKS,To smooth the little troubles out and drive the cares away.

2071,JUST FOLKS,When Mother Cooked With Wood
2072,JUST FOLKS,
2073,JUST FOLKS,"I do not quarrel with the gas,"
2074,JUST FOLKS,"Our modern range is fine,"
2075,JUST FOLKS,The ancient stove was doomed to pass
2076,JUST FOLKS,"From Time's grim firing line,"
2077,JUST FOLKS,Yet now and then there comes to me
2078,JUST FOLKS,The thought of dinners good
2079,JUST FOLKS,And pies and cake that used to be
2080,JUST FOLKS,When mother cooked with wood.
2081,JUST FOLKS,
2082,JUST FOLKS,"The axe has vanished from the yard,"
2083,JUST FOLKS,"The chopping block is gone,"
2084,JUST FOLKS,There is no pile of cordwood hard
2085,JUST FOLKS,For boys to work upon;
2086,JUST FOLKS,There is no box that must be filled
2087,JUST FOLKS,Each morning to the hood;
2088,JUST FOLKS,Time in its ruthlessness has willed
2089,JUST FOLKS,The passing of the wood.
2090,JUST FOLKS,
2091,JUST FOLKS,And yet those days were fragrant days
2092,JUST FOLKS,And spicy days and rare;
2093,JUST FOLKS,The kitchen knew a cheerful blaze
2094,JUST FOLKS,And friendliness was there.
2095,JUST FOLKS,And every appetite was keen
2096,JUST FOLKS,For breakfasts that were good
2097,JUST FOLKS,When I had scarcely turned thirteen
2098,JUST FOLKS,And mother cooked with wood.
2099,JUST FOLKS,
2100,JUST FOLKS,"I used to dread my daily chore,"
2101,JUST FOLKS,I used to think it tough
2102,JUST FOLKS,When mother at the kitchen door
2103,JUST FOLKS,Said I'd not chopped enough.
2104,JUST FOLKS,"And on her baking days, I know,"
2105,JUST FOLKS,I shirked whene'er I could
2106,JUST FOLKS,In that now happy long ago
2107,JUST FOLKS,When mother cooked with wood.
2108,JUST FOLKS,
2109,JUST FOLKS,I never thought I'd wish to see
2110,JUST FOLKS,That pile of wood again;
2111,JUST FOLKS,Back then it only seemed to me
2112,JUST FOLKS,A source of care and pain.
2113,JUST FOLKS,But now I'd gladly give my all
2114,JUST FOLKS,"To stand where once I stood,"
2115,JUST FOLKS,If those rare days I could recall
2116,JUST FOLKS,When mother cooked with wood.
2117,JUST FOLKS,

2121,JUST FOLKS,Midnight in the Pantry
2122,JUST FOLKS,
2123,JUST FOLKS,"You can boast your round of pleasures, praise the sound of popping corks,"
2124,JUST FOLKS,Where the orchestra is playing to the rattle of the forks;
2125,JUST FOLKS,"And your after-opera dinner you may think superbly fine,"
2126,JUST FOLKS,"But that can't compare, I'm certain, to the joy that's always mine"
2127,JUST FOLKS,"When I reach my little dwelling--source, of all sincere delight--"
2128,JUST FOLKS,And I prowl around the pantry in the waning hours of night.
2129,JUST FOLKS,
2130,JUST FOLKS,"When my business, or my pleasure, has detained me until late,"
2131,JUST FOLKS,"And it's midnight, say, or after, when I reach my own estate,"
2132,JUST FOLKS,"Though I'm weary with my toiling I don't hustle up to bed,"
2133,JUST FOLKS,For the inner man is hungry and he's anxious to be fed;
2134,JUST FOLKS,Then I feel a thrill of glory from my head down to my feet
2135,JUST FOLKS,As I prowl around the pantry after something good to eat.
2136,JUST FOLKS,
2137,JUST FOLKS,"Oft I hear a call above me: ""Goodness gracious, come to bed!"""
2138,JUST FOLKS,"And I know that I've disturbed her by my overeager tread,"
2139,JUST FOLKS,"But I've found a glass of jelly and some bread and butter, too,"
2140,JUST FOLKS,"And a bit of cold fried chicken and I answer: ""When I'm through!"""
2141,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, there's no cafe that better serves my precious appetite"
2142,JUST FOLKS,Than the pantry in our kitchen when I get home late at night.
2143,JUST FOLKS,
2144,JUST FOLKS,"You may boast your shining silver, and the linen and the flowers,"
2145,JUST FOLKS,And the music and the laughter and the lights that hang in showers;
2146,JUST FOLKS,"You may have your cafe table with its brilliant array,"
2147,JUST FOLKS,But it doesn't charm yours truly when I'm on my homeward way;

2149,JUST FOLKS,Just the joy of pantry-prowling in the middle of the night.

2154,JUST FOLKS,The World Is Against Me
2155,JUST FOLKS,
2156,JUST FOLKS,"""The world is against me,"" he said with a sigh."
2157,JUST FOLKS,"""Somebody stops every scheme that I try."
2158,JUST FOLKS,The world has me down and it's keeping me there;
2159,JUST FOLKS,"I don't get a chance. Oh, the world is unfair!"
2160,JUST FOLKS,When a fellow is poor then he can't get a show;
2161,JUST FOLKS,"The world is determined to keep him down low."""
2162,JUST FOLKS,
2163,JUST FOLKS,"""What of Abe Lincoln?"" I asked. ""Would you say"
2164,JUST FOLKS,That he was much richer than you are to-day?
2165,JUST FOLKS,"He hadn't your chance of making his mark,"
2166,JUST FOLKS,And his outlook was often exceedingly dark;
2167,JUST FOLKS,Yet he clung to his purpose with courage most grim
2168,JUST FOLKS,"And he got to the top. Was the world against him?"""
2169,JUST FOLKS,
2170,JUST FOLKS,"""What of Ben Franklin? I've oft heard it said"
2171,JUST FOLKS,That many a time he went hungry to bed.
2172,JUST FOLKS,"He started with nothing but courage to climb,"
2173,JUST FOLKS,But patiently struggled and waited his time.
2174,JUST FOLKS,"He dangled awhile from real poverty's limb,"
2175,JUST FOLKS,Yet he got to the top. Was the world against him?
2176,JUST FOLKS,
2177,JUST FOLKS,"""I could name you a dozen, yes, hundreds, I guess,"
2178,JUST FOLKS,Of poor boys who've patiently climbed to success;
2179,JUST FOLKS,"All boys who were down and who struggled alone,"
2180,JUST FOLKS,Who'd have thought themselves rich if your fortune they'd known;
2181,JUST FOLKS,"Yet they rose in the world you're so quick to condemn,"
2182,JUST FOLKS,"And I'm asking you now, was the world against them?"""

2186,JUST FOLKS,
2187,JUST FOLKS,Bribed
2188,JUST FOLKS,
2189,JUST FOLKS,I know that what I did was wrong;
2190,JUST FOLKS,I should have sent you far away.
2191,JUST FOLKS,"You tempted me, and I'm not strong;"
2192,JUST FOLKS,I tried but couldn't answer nay.
2193,JUST FOLKS,I should have packed you off to bed;
2194,JUST FOLKS,"Instead I let you stay awhile,"
2195,JUST FOLKS,And mother scolded when I said
2196,JUST FOLKS,That you had bribed me with your smile.
2197,JUST FOLKS,
2198,JUST FOLKS,And yesterday I gave to you
2199,JUST FOLKS,"Another piece of chocolate cake,"
2200,JUST FOLKS,"Some red-ripe watermelon, too,"
2201,JUST FOLKS,And that gave you the stomach ache.
2202,JUST FOLKS,And that was after I'd been told
2203,JUST FOLKS,"You'd had enough, you saucy miss;"
2204,JUST FOLKS,"You tempted me, you five-year-old,"
2205,JUST FOLKS,And bribed me with a hug and kiss.
2206,JUST FOLKS,
2207,JUST FOLKS,And mother said I mustn't get
2208,JUST FOLKS,"You roller skates, yet here they are;"
2209,JUST FOLKS,I haven't dared to tell her yet;
2210,JUST FOLKS,"Some time, she says, I'll go too far."
2211,JUST FOLKS,I gave my word I wouldn't buy
2212,JUST FOLKS,"These things, for accidents she fears;"
2213,JUST FOLKS,"Now I must tell, when questioned why,"
2214,JUST FOLKS,Just how you bribed me with your tears.
2215,JUST FOLKS,
2216,JUST FOLKS,"I've tried so hard to do the right,"
2217,JUST FOLKS,Yet I have broken every vow.
2218,JUST FOLKS,"I let you do, most every night,"
2219,JUST FOLKS,The things your mother won't allow.
2220,JUST FOLKS,"I know that I am doing wrong,"
2221,JUST FOLKS,"Yet all my sense of honor flies,"
2222,JUST FOLKS,The moment that you come along
2223,JUST FOLKS,And bribe me with those wondrous eyes.

2228,JUST FOLKS,The Home Builders
2229,JUST FOLKS,
2230,JUST FOLKS,"The world is filled with bustle and with selfishness and greed,"
2231,JUST FOLKS,It is filled with restless people that are dreaming of a deed.
2232,JUST FOLKS,You can read it in their faces; they are dreaming of the day
2233,JUST FOLKS,When they'll come to fame and fortune and put all their cares away.
2234,JUST FOLKS,"And I think as I behold them, though it's far indeed they roam,"
2235,JUST FOLKS,They will never find contentment save they seek for it at home.
2236,JUST FOLKS,
2237,JUST FOLKS,"I watch them as they hurry through the surging lines of men,"
2238,JUST FOLKS,"Spurred to speed by grim ambition, and I know they're dreaming then."
2239,JUST FOLKS,"They are weary, sick and footsore, but their goal seems far away,"
2240,JUST FOLKS,And it's little they've accomplished at the ending of the day.
2241,JUST FOLKS,"It is rest they're vainly seeking, love and laughter in the gloam,"
2242,JUST FOLKS,"But they'll never come to claim it, save they claim it here at home."
2243,JUST FOLKS,
2244,JUST FOLKS,"For the peace that is the sweetest isn't born of minted gold,"
2245,JUST FOLKS,And the joy that lasts the longest and still lingers when we're old
2246,JUST FOLKS,"Is no dim and distant pleasure--it is not to-morrow's prize,"
2247,JUST FOLKS,"It is not the end of toiling, or the rainbow of our sighs."
2248,JUST FOLKS,It' is every day within us--all the rest is hippodrome--
2249,JUST FOLKS,And the soul that is the gladdest is the soul that builds a home.
2250,JUST FOLKS,
2251,JUST FOLKS,They are fools who build for glory! They are fools who pin their hopes
2252,JUST FOLKS,On the come and go of battles or some vessel's slender ropes.
2253,JUST FOLKS,They shall sicken and shall wither and shall never peace attain
2254,JUST FOLKS,Who believe that real contentment only men victorious gain.
2255,JUST FOLKS,For the only happy toilers under earth's majestic dome
2256,JUST FOLKS,Are the ones who find their glories in the little spot called home.

2261,JUST FOLKS,My Books and I
2262,JUST FOLKS,
2263,JUST FOLKS,My books and I are good old pals:
2264,JUST FOLKS,"My laughing books are gay,"
2265,JUST FOLKS,Just suited for my merry moods
2266,JUST FOLKS,When I am wont to play.
2267,JUST FOLKS,Bill Nye comes down to joke with me
2268,JUST FOLKS,"And, Oh, the joy he spreads."
2269,JUST FOLKS,Just like two fools we sit and laugh
2270,JUST FOLKS,And shake our merry heads.
2271,JUST FOLKS,
2272,JUST FOLKS,"When I am in a thoughtful mood,"
2273,JUST FOLKS,"With Stevenson I sit,"
2274,JUST FOLKS,Who seems to know I've had enough
2275,JUST FOLKS,Of Bill Nye and his wit.
2276,JUST FOLKS,"And so, more thoughtful than I am,"
2277,JUST FOLKS,"He talks of lofty things,"
2278,JUST FOLKS,And thus an evening hour we spend
2279,JUST FOLKS,Sedate and grave as kings.
2280,JUST FOLKS,
2281,JUST FOLKS,And should my soul be torn with grief
2282,JUST FOLKS,Upon my shelf I find
2283,JUST FOLKS,"A little volume, torn and thumbled,"
2284,JUST FOLKS,For comfort just designed.
2285,JUST FOLKS,I take my little Bible down
2286,JUST FOLKS,"And read its pages o'er,"
2287,JUST FOLKS,And when I part from it I find
2288,JUST FOLKS,I'm stronger than before.

2293,JUST FOLKS,Success
2294,JUST FOLKS,
2295,JUST FOLKS,"I hold no dream of fortune vast,"
2296,JUST FOLKS,Nor seek undying fame.
2297,JUST FOLKS,I do not ask when life is past
2298,JUST FOLKS,That many know my name.
2299,JUST FOLKS,
2300,JUST FOLKS,I may not own the skill to rise
2301,JUST FOLKS,"To glory's topmost height,"
2302,JUST FOLKS,"Nor win a place among the wise,"
2303,JUST FOLKS,But I can keep the right.
2304,JUST FOLKS,
2305,JUST FOLKS,And I can live my life on earth
2306,JUST FOLKS,"Contented to the end,"
2307,JUST FOLKS,If but a few shall know my worth
2308,JUST FOLKS,And proudly call me friend.

2313,JUST FOLKS,Questions
2314,JUST FOLKS,
2315,JUST FOLKS,Would you sell your boy for a stack of gold?
2316,JUST FOLKS,Would you miss that hand that is yours to hold?
2317,JUST FOLKS,Would you take a fortune and never see
2318,JUST FOLKS,"The man, in a few brief years, he'll be?"
2319,JUST FOLKS,"Suppose that his body were racked with pain,"
2320,JUST FOLKS,How much would you pay for his health again?
2321,JUST FOLKS,
2322,JUST FOLKS,Is there money enough in the world to-day
2323,JUST FOLKS,To buy your boy? Could a monarch pay
2324,JUST FOLKS,You silver and gold in so large a sum
2325,JUST FOLKS,That you'd have him blinded or stricken dumb?
2326,JUST FOLKS,"How much would you take, if you had the choice,"
2327,JUST FOLKS,"Never to hear, in this world, his voice?"
2328,JUST FOLKS,
2329,JUST FOLKS,How much would you take in exchange for all
2330,JUST FOLKS,The joy that is wrapped in that youngster small?
2331,JUST FOLKS,Are there diamonds enough in the mines of earth
2332,JUST FOLKS,To equal your dreams of that youngster's worth?
2333,JUST FOLKS,Would you give up the hours that he's on your knee
2334,JUST FOLKS,The richest man in the world to be?
2335,JUST FOLKS,
2336,JUST FOLKS,"You may prate of gold, but your fortune lies,"
2337,JUST FOLKS,"And you know it well, in your boy's bright eyes."
2338,JUST FOLKS,And there's nothing that money can buy or do
2339,JUST FOLKS,That means so much as that boy to you.
2340,JUST FOLKS,"Well, which does the most of your time employ,"
2341,JUST FOLKS,The chase for gold--or that splendid boy?
2342,JUST FOLKS,
2343,JUST FOLKS,
2344,JUST FOLKS,
2345,JUST FOLKS,
2346,JUST FOLKS,Sausage
2347,JUST FOLKS,
2348,JUST FOLKS,"You may brag about your breakfast foods you eat at break of day,"
2349,JUST FOLKS,"Your crisp, delightful shavings and your stack of last year's hay,"
2350,JUST FOLKS,"Your toasted flakes of rye and corn that fairly swim in cream,"
2351,JUST FOLKS,"Or rave about a sawdust mash, an epicurean dream."
2352,JUST FOLKS,"But none of these appeals to me, though all of them I've tried--"
2353,JUST FOLKS,The breakfast that I liked the best was sausage mother fried.
2354,JUST FOLKS,
2355,JUST FOLKS,"Old country sausage was its name; the kind, of course, you know,"
2356,JUST FOLKS,"The little links that seemed to be almost as white as snow,"
2357,JUST FOLKS,"But turned unto a ruddy brown, while sizzling in the pan;"
2358,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, they were made both to appease and charm the inner man."
2359,JUST FOLKS,"All these new-fangled dishes make me blush and turn aside,"
2360,JUST FOLKS,When I think about the sausage that for breakfast mother fried.
2361,JUST FOLKS,
2362,JUST FOLKS,"When they roused me from my slumbers and I left to do the chores,"
2363,JUST FOLKS,It wasn't long before I breathed a fragrance out of doors
2364,JUST FOLKS,"That seemed to grip my spirit, and to thrill my body through,"
2365,JUST FOLKS,"For the spice of hunger tingled, and 'twas then I plainly knew"
2366,JUST FOLKS,That the gnawing at my stomach would be quickly satisfied
2367,JUST FOLKS,By a plate of country sausage that my dear old mother fried.
2368,JUST FOLKS,
2369,JUST FOLKS,"There upon the kitchen table, with its cloth of turkey red,"
2370,JUST FOLKS,"Was a platter heaped with sausage and a plate of home-made bread,"
2371,JUST FOLKS,And a cup of coffee waiting--not a puny demitasse
2372,JUST FOLKS,"That can scarcely hold a mouthful, but a cup of greater class;"
2373,JUST FOLKS,"And I fell to eating largely, for I could not be denied--"
2374,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, I'm sure a king would relish the sausage mother fried."
2375,JUST FOLKS,
2376,JUST FOLKS,Times have changed and so have breakfasts; now each morning when I see
2377,JUST FOLKS,"A dish of shredded something or of flakes passed up to me,"
2378,JUST FOLKS,"All my thoughts go back to boyhood, to the days of long ago,"
2379,JUST FOLKS,When the morning meal meant something more than vain and idle show.
2380,JUST FOLKS,"And I hunger, Oh, I hunger, in a way I cannot hide,"
2381,JUST FOLKS,For a plate of steaming sausage like the kind my mother fried.
2382,JUST FOLKS,

2385,JUST FOLKS,
2386,JUST FOLKS,Friends
2387,JUST FOLKS,
2388,JUST FOLKS,Ain't it fine when things are going
2389,JUST FOLKS,Topsy-turvy and askew
2390,JUST FOLKS,To discover someone showing
2391,JUST FOLKS,Good old-fashioned faith in you?
2392,JUST FOLKS,
2393,JUST FOLKS,Ain't it good when life seems dreary
2394,JUST FOLKS,"And your hopes about to end,"
2395,JUST FOLKS,Just to feel the handclasp cheery
2396,JUST FOLKS,Of a fine old loyal friend?
2397,JUST FOLKS,
2398,JUST FOLKS,Gosh! one fellow to another
2399,JUST FOLKS,"Means a lot from day to day,"
2400,JUST FOLKS,Seems we're living for each other
2401,JUST FOLKS,In a friendly sort of way.
2402,JUST FOLKS,
2403,JUST FOLKS,When a smile or cheerful greetin'
2404,JUST FOLKS,"Means so much to fellows sore,"
2405,JUST FOLKS,Seems we ought to keep repeatin'
2406,JUST FOLKS,Smiles an' praises more an' more.

2411,JUST FOLKS,A Boost for Modern Methods
2412,JUST FOLKS,
2413,JUST FOLKS,"In some respects the old days were perhaps ahead of these,"
2414,JUST FOLKS,Before we got to wanting wealth and costly luxuries;
2415,JUST FOLKS,"Perhaps the world was happier then, I'm not the one to say,"
2416,JUST FOLKS,But when it's zero weather I am glad I live to-day.
2417,JUST FOLKS,
2418,JUST FOLKS,Old-fashioned winters I recall--the winters of my youth--
2419,JUST FOLKS,"I have no great desire for them to-day, I say in truth;"
2420,JUST FOLKS,"The frost upon the window panes was beautiful to see,"
2421,JUST FOLKS,But the chill upon that bedroom floor was not a joy to me.
2422,JUST FOLKS,
2423,JUST FOLKS,I do not now recall that it was fun in those days when
2424,JUST FOLKS,"I woke to learn the water pipes were frozen tight ""again."""
2425,JUST FOLKS,"To win once more the old-time joys, I don't believe I'd care"
2426,JUST FOLKS,"To have to sleep, for comfort's sake, dressed in my underwear."
2427,JUST FOLKS,
2428,JUST FOLKS,"Old-fashioned winters had their charms, a fact I can't deny,"
2429,JUST FOLKS,But after all I'm really glad that they have wandered by;
2430,JUST FOLKS,"We used to tumble out of bed, like firemen, I declare,"
2431,JUST FOLKS,And grab our clothes and hike down stairs and finish dressing there.
2432,JUST FOLKS,
2433,JUST FOLKS,"Yes, brag about those days of old, boast of them as you will,"
2434,JUST FOLKS,I sing the modern methods that have robbed them of their chill;
2435,JUST FOLKS,I sing the cheery steam pipe and the upstairs snug and warm
2436,JUST FOLKS,And a spine that's free from shivers as I robe my manly form.

2441,JUST FOLKS,The Man to Be
2442,JUST FOLKS,
2443,JUST FOLKS,"Some day the world will need a man of courage in a time of doubt,"
2444,JUST FOLKS,"And somewhere, as a little boy, that future hero plays about."
2445,JUST FOLKS,"Within some humble home, no doubt, that instrument of greater things"
2446,JUST FOLKS,Now climbs upon his father's knee or to his mother's garments clings.
2447,JUST FOLKS,"And when shall come that call for him to render service that is fine,"
2448,JUST FOLKS,He that shall do God's mission here may be your little boy or mine.
2449,JUST FOLKS,
2450,JUST FOLKS,"Long years of preparation mark the pathway for the splendid souls,"
2451,JUST FOLKS,"And generations live and die and seem no nearer to their goals,"
2452,JUST FOLKS,"And yet the purpose of it all, the fleeting pleasure and the woe,"
2453,JUST FOLKS,The laughter and the grief of life that all who come to earth must know
2454,JUST FOLKS,May be to pave the way for one--one man to serve the Will Divine
2455,JUST FOLKS,And it is possible that he may be your little boy or mine.
2456,JUST FOLKS,
2457,JUST FOLKS,Some day the world will need a man! I stand beside his cot at night
2458,JUST FOLKS,"And wonder if I'm teaching him, as best I can, to know the right."
2459,JUST FOLKS,I am the father of a boy--his life is mine to make or mar--
2460,JUST FOLKS,And he no better can become than what my daily teachings are;
2461,JUST FOLKS,There will be need for someone great--I dare not falter from the line--
2462,JUST FOLKS,The man that is to serve the world may be that little boy of mine.
2463,JUST FOLKS,
2464,JUST FOLKS,Perhaps your boy and mine may not ascend the lofty heights of fame;
2465,JUST FOLKS,The orders for their births are hid. We know not why to earth they came.
2466,JUST FOLKS,Yet in some little bed to-night the great man of to-morrow sleeps
2467,JUST FOLKS,"And only He who sent him here, the secret of his purpose keeps."
2468,JUST FOLKS,As fathers then our care is this--to keep in mind the Great Design.
2469,JUST FOLKS,The man the world shall need some day may be your little boy or mine.

2475,JUST FOLKS,
2476,JUST FOLKS,"I like 'em, in the winter when their cheeks are slightly pale,"
2477,JUST FOLKS,I like 'em in the spring time when the March winds blow a gale;
2478,JUST FOLKS,"But when summer suns have tanned 'em and they're racing to and fro,"
2479,JUST FOLKS,I somehow think the children make the finest sort of show.
2480,JUST FOLKS,
2481,JUST FOLKS,"When they're brown as little berries and they're bare of foot and head,"
2482,JUST FOLKS,"And they're on the go each minute where the velvet lawns are spread,"
2483,JUST FOLKS,"Then their health is at its finest and they never stop to rest,"
2484,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, it's then I think the children look and are their very best."
2485,JUST FOLKS,
2486,JUST FOLKS,"We've got to know the winter and we've got to know the spring,"
2487,JUST FOLKS,"But for children, could I do it, unto summer I would cling;"
2488,JUST FOLKS,"For I'm happiest when I see 'em, as a wild and merry band"
2489,JUST FOLKS,"Of healthy, lusty youngsters that the summer sun has tanned."

2498,JUST FOLKS,"The mist at dusk is risin' over valley, marsh an' fen"

2500,JUST FOLKS,

2505,JUST FOLKS,
2506,JUST FOLKS,"But the air is mighty peaceful an' the scene is good to see,"

2514,JUST FOLKS,On Quitting
2515,JUST FOLKS,
2516,JUST FOLKS,How much grit do you think you've got?
2517,JUST FOLKS,Can you quit a thing that you like a lot?
2518,JUST FOLKS,"You may talk of pluck; it's an easy word,"
2519,JUST FOLKS,And where'er you go it is often heard;
2520,JUST FOLKS,But can you tell to a jot or guess
2521,JUST FOLKS,Just how much courage you now possess?
2522,JUST FOLKS,
2523,JUST FOLKS,"You may stand to trouble and keep your grin,"
2524,JUST FOLKS,But have you tackled self-discipline?
2525,JUST FOLKS,Have you ever issued commands to you
2526,JUST FOLKS,"To quit the things that you like to do,"
2527,JUST FOLKS,"And then, when tempted and sorely swayed,"
2528,JUST FOLKS,Those rigid orders have you obeyed?
2529,JUST FOLKS,
2530,JUST FOLKS,"Don't boast of your grit till you've tried it out,"
2531,JUST FOLKS,"Nor prate to men of your courage stout,"
2532,JUST FOLKS,For it's easy enough to retain a grin
2533,JUST FOLKS,"In the face of a fight there's a chance to win,"
2534,JUST FOLKS,But the sort of grit that is good to own
2535,JUST FOLKS,Is the stuff you need when you're all alone.
2536,JUST FOLKS,
2537,JUST FOLKS,How much grit do you think you've got?
2538,JUST FOLKS,Can you turn from joys that you like a lot?
2539,JUST FOLKS,Have you ever tested yourself to know
2540,JUST FOLKS,How far with yourself your will can go?
2541,JUST FOLKS,"If you want to know if you have grit,"
2542,JUST FOLKS,"Just pick out a joy that you like, and quit."
2543,JUST FOLKS,
2544,JUST FOLKS,It's bully sport and it's open fight;
2545,JUST FOLKS,It will keep you busy both day and night;
2546,JUST FOLKS,For the toughest kind of a game you'll find
2547,JUST FOLKS,Is to make your body obey your mind.
2548,JUST FOLKS,And you never will know what is meant by grit
2549,JUST FOLKS,Unless there's something you've tried to quit.

2554,JUST FOLKS,The Price of Riches
2555,JUST FOLKS,
2556,JUST FOLKS,Nobody stops at the rich man's door to pass the time of day.
2557,JUST FOLKS,"Nobody shouts a ""hello!"" to him in the good old-fashioned way."
2558,JUST FOLKS,Nobody comes to his porch at night and sits in that extra chair
2559,JUST FOLKS,And talks till it's time to go to bed. He's all by himself up there.
2560,JUST FOLKS,
2561,JUST FOLKS,"Nobody just happens in to call on the long, cold winter nights."
2562,JUST FOLKS,"Nobody feels that he's welcome now, though the house is ablaze with lights."
2563,JUST FOLKS,And never an unexpected guest will tap at his massive door
2564,JUST FOLKS,"And stay to tea as he used to do, for his neighborly days are o'er."
2565,JUST FOLKS,
2566,JUST FOLKS,"It's a distant life that the rich man leads and many an hour is glum,"
2567,JUST FOLKS,For never the neighbors call on him save when they are asked to come.
2568,JUST FOLKS,"At heart he is just as he used to be and he longs for his friends of old,"
2569,JUST FOLKS,But they never will venture unbidden there. They're afraid of his wall of gold.
2570,JUST FOLKS,
2571,JUST FOLKS,"For silver and gold in a large amount there's a price that all men must pay,"
2572,JUST FOLKS,And who will dwell in a rich man's house must live in a lonely way.
2573,JUST FOLKS,For once you have builded a fortune vast you will sigh for the friends you knew
2574,JUST FOLKS,But never they'll tap at your door again in the way that they used to do.

2603,JUST FOLKS,"Who never seems to feel the woe,"
2604,JUST FOLKS,The anguish and the pain we know?
2605,JUST FOLKS,Who gets the best seats at the show?
2606,JUST FOLKS,The other fellow.
2607,JUST FOLKS,
2608,JUST FOLKS,"And yet, my friend, who envies you?"
2609,JUST FOLKS,The other fellow.
2610,JUST FOLKS,Who thinks he gathers only rue?
2611,JUST FOLKS,The other fellow.

2621,JUST FOLKS,
2622,JUST FOLKS,"There in the flame of the open grate,"
2623,JUST FOLKS,All that is good in the past I see:
2624,JUST FOLKS,"Red-lipped youth on the swinging gate,"
2625,JUST FOLKS,Bright-eyed youth with its minstrelsy;
2626,JUST FOLKS,"Girls and boys that I used to know,"
2627,JUST FOLKS,"Back in the days of Long Ago,"
2628,JUST FOLKS,"Troop before in the smoke and flame,"
2629,JUST FOLKS,"Chatter and sing, as the wild birds do."
2630,JUST FOLKS,"Everyone I can call by name,"
2631,JUST FOLKS,For the fire builds all of my youth anew.
2632,JUST FOLKS,
2633,JUST FOLKS,"Outside, people go stamping by,"
2634,JUST FOLKS,"Squeak of wheel on the evening air,"
2635,JUST FOLKS,"Stars and planets race through the sky,"
2636,JUST FOLKS,Here are darkness and silence rare;
2637,JUST FOLKS,Only the flames in the open grate
2638,JUST FOLKS,"Crackle and flare as they burn up hate,"
2639,JUST FOLKS,"Malice and envy and greed for gold,"
2640,JUST FOLKS,"Dancing, laughing my cares away;"
2641,JUST FOLKS,"I've forgotten that I am old,"
2642,JUST FOLKS,Once again I'm a boy at play.
2643,JUST FOLKS,
2644,JUST FOLKS,There in the flame of the open grate
2645,JUST FOLKS,Bright the pictures come and go;
2646,JUST FOLKS,"Lovers swing on the garden gate,"
2647,JUST FOLKS,Lovers kiss 'neath the mistletoe.
2648,JUST FOLKS,"I've forgotten that I am old,"
2649,JUST FOLKS,I've forgotten my story's told;
2650,JUST FOLKS,"Whistling boy down the lane I stroll,"
2651,JUST FOLKS,"All untouched by the blows of fate,"
2652,JUST FOLKS,"Time turns back and I'm young of soul,"
2653,JUST FOLKS,Dreaming there by the open grate.

2658,JUST FOLKS,Improvement
2659,JUST FOLKS,
2660,JUST FOLKS,"The joy of life is living it, or so it seems to me;"
2661,JUST FOLKS,"In finding shackles on your wrists, then struggling till you're free;"
2662,JUST FOLKS,"In seeing wrongs and righting them, in dreaming splendid dreams,"
2663,JUST FOLKS,Then toiling till the vision is as real as moving streams.
2664,JUST FOLKS,The happiest mortal on the earth is he who ends his day
2665,JUST FOLKS,By leaving better than he found to bloom along the way.
2666,JUST FOLKS,
2667,JUST FOLKS,Were all things perfect here there would be naught for man to do;
2668,JUST FOLKS,If what is old were good enough we'd never need the new.
2669,JUST FOLKS,The only happy time of rest is that which follows strife
2670,JUST FOLKS,And sees some contribution made unto the joy of life.
2671,JUST FOLKS,And he who has oppression felt and conquered it is he
2672,JUST FOLKS,Who really knows the happiness and peace of being free.
2673,JUST FOLKS,
2674,JUST FOLKS,The miseries of earth are here and with them all must cope.
2675,JUST FOLKS,"Who seeks for joy, through hedges thick of care and pain must grope."
2676,JUST FOLKS,Through disappointment man must go to value pleasure's thrill;
2677,JUST FOLKS,To really know the joy of health a man must first be ill.
2678,JUST FOLKS,"The wrongs are here for man to right, and happiness is had"
2679,JUST FOLKS,By striving to supplant with good the evil and the bad.
2680,JUST FOLKS,
2681,JUST FOLKS,"The joy of life is living it and doing things of worth,"
2682,JUST FOLKS,In making bright and fruitful all the barren spots of earth.
2683,JUST FOLKS,"In facing odds and mastering them and rising from defeat,"
2684,JUST FOLKS,"And making true what once was false, and what was bitter, sweet."
2685,JUST FOLKS,For only he knows perfect joy whose little bit of soil
2686,JUST FOLKS,Is richer ground than what it was when he began to toil.

2695,JUST FOLKS,Just drop the long familiar ways
2696,JUST FOLKS,And live again the old-time days
2697,JUST FOLKS,When love was new and youth was bright
2698,JUST FOLKS,"And all was laughter and delight,"
2699,JUST FOLKS,And treat her as you would if she
2700,JUST FOLKS,Were still the girl that used to be.
2701,JUST FOLKS,
2702,JUST FOLKS,Pretend that all the years have passed
2703,JUST FOLKS,Without one cold and wintry blast;
2704,JUST FOLKS,That you are coming still to woo
2705,JUST FOLKS,Your sweetheart as you used to do;
2706,JUST FOLKS,Forget that you have walked along
2707,JUST FOLKS,The paths of life where right and wrong
2708,JUST FOLKS,"And joy and grief in battle are,"
2709,JUST FOLKS,And play the heart without a scar.
2710,JUST FOLKS,
2711,JUST FOLKS,Be what you were when youth was fine
2712,JUST FOLKS,And send to her a valentine;
2713,JUST FOLKS,Forget the burdens and the woe
2714,JUST FOLKS,That have been given you to know
2715,JUST FOLKS,"And to the wife, so fond and true,"
2716,JUST FOLKS,The pledges of the past renew
2717,JUST FOLKS,'Twill cure her life of every ill
2718,JUST FOLKS,To find that you're her sweetheart still.

2724,JUST FOLKS,
2725,JUST FOLKS,"Who is it lives to the full every minute,"
2726,JUST FOLKS,Gets all the joy and the fun that is in it?
2727,JUST FOLKS,"Tough as they make 'em, and ready to race,"
2728,JUST FOLKS,"Fit for a battle and fit for a chase,"
2729,JUST FOLKS,"Heedless of buttons on blouses and pants,"
2730,JUST FOLKS,"Laughing at danger and taking a chance,"
2731,JUST FOLKS,"Gladdest, it seems, when he wallows in mud,"
2732,JUST FOLKS,"Who is the rascal? I'll tell you, it's Bud!"
2733,JUST FOLKS,
2734,JUST FOLKS,"Who is it wakes with a shout of delight,"
2735,JUST FOLKS,And comes to our room with a smile that is bright?
2736,JUST FOLKS,Who is it springs into bed with a leap
2737,JUST FOLKS,And thinks it is queer that his dad wants to sleep?
2738,JUST FOLKS,Who answers his growling with laughter and tries
2739,JUST FOLKS,His patience by lifting the lids of his eyes?
2740,JUST FOLKS,Who jumps in the air and then lands with a thud
2741,JUST FOLKS,"On his poor daddy's stomach? I'll tell you, it's Bud!"
2742,JUST FOLKS,
2743,JUST FOLKS,Who is it thinks life is but laughter and play
2744,JUST FOLKS,And doesn't know care is a part of the day?
2745,JUST FOLKS,Who is reckless of stockings and heedless of shoes?
2746,JUST FOLKS,Who laughs at a tumble and grins at a bruise?
2747,JUST FOLKS,"Who climbs over fences and clambers up trees,"
2748,JUST FOLKS,And scrapes all the skin off his shins and his knees?
2749,JUST FOLKS,Who sometimes comes home all bespattered with blood
2750,JUST FOLKS,That was drawn by a fall? It's that rascal called Bud.
2751,JUST FOLKS,
2752,JUST FOLKS,"Yet, who is it makes all our toiling worth while?"
2753,JUST FOLKS,"Who can cure every ache that we know, by his smile?"
2754,JUST FOLKS,Who is prince to his mother and king to his dad
2755,JUST FOLKS,And makes us forget that we ever were sad?
2756,JUST FOLKS,"Who is center of all that we dream of and plan,"
2757,JUST FOLKS,Our baby to-day but to-morrow our man?
2758,JUST FOLKS,"It's that tough little, rough little tyke in the mud,"

2765,JUST FOLKS,
2766,JUST FOLKS,"When I was but a little lad I always liked to ride,"
2767,JUST FOLKS,"No matter what the rig we had, right by the driver's side."
2768,JUST FOLKS,"The front seat was the honor place in bob-sleigh, coach or hack,"
2769,JUST FOLKS,And I maneuvered to avoid the cushions in the back.
2770,JUST FOLKS,"We children used to scramble then to share the driver's seat,"
2771,JUST FOLKS,And long the pout I wore when I was not allowed that treat.
2772,JUST FOLKS,Though times have changed and I am old I still confess I race
2773,JUST FOLKS,With other grown-ups now and then to get my favorite place.
2774,JUST FOLKS,
2775,JUST FOLKS,The auto with its cushions fine and big and easy springs
2776,JUST FOLKS,"Has altered in our daily lives innumerable things,"
2777,JUST FOLKS,"But hearts of men are still the same as what they used to be,"
2778,JUST FOLKS,"When surreys were the stylish rigs, or so they seem to me,"
2779,JUST FOLKS,For every grown-up girl to-day and every grown-up boy
2780,JUST FOLKS,"Still hungers for the seat in front and scrambles for its joy,"
2781,JUST FOLKS,And riding by the driver's side still holds the charm it did
2782,JUST FOLKS,"In those glad, youthful days gone by when I was just a kid."
2783,JUST FOLKS,
2784,JUST FOLKS,"I hurry, as I used to do, to claim that favorite place,"
2785,JUST FOLKS,And when a tonneau seat is mine I wear a solemn face.
2786,JUST FOLKS,"I try to hide the pout I feel, and do my best to smile,"
2787,JUST FOLKS,But envy of the man in front gnaws at me all the while.
2788,JUST FOLKS,"I want to be where I can see the road that lies ahead,"
2789,JUST FOLKS,To watch the trees go flying by and see the country spread
2790,JUST FOLKS,"Before me as we spin along, for there I miss the fear"
2791,JUST FOLKS,That seems to grip the soul of me while riding in the rear.
2792,JUST FOLKS,
2793,JUST FOLKS,And I am not alone in this. To-day I drive a car
2794,JUST FOLKS,"And three glad youngsters madly strive to share the ""seat with Pa."""
2795,JUST FOLKS,"And older folks that ride with us, I very plainly see,"
2796,JUST FOLKS,Maneuver in their artful ways to sit in front with me;
2797,JUST FOLKS,"Though all the cushions in the world were piled up in the rear,"
2798,JUST FOLKS,The child in all of us still longs to watch the engineer.
2799,JUST FOLKS,"And happier hearts we seem to own when we're allowed to ride,"
2800,JUST FOLKS,"No matter what the car may be, close by the driver's side."

2806,JUST FOLKS,
2807,JUST FOLKS,There are no gods that bring to youth
2808,JUST FOLKS,The rich rewards that stalwarts claim;
2809,JUST FOLKS,The god of fortune is in truth
2810,JUST FOLKS,A vision and an empty name.
2811,JUST FOLKS,The toiler who through doubt and care
2812,JUST FOLKS,"Unto his goal and victory plods,"
2813,JUST FOLKS,With no one need his glory share:
2814,JUST FOLKS,He is himself his favoring gods.
2815,JUST FOLKS,
2816,JUST FOLKS,There are no gods that will bestow
2817,JUST FOLKS,Earth's joys and blessings on a man.
2818,JUST FOLKS,"Each one must choose the path he'll go,"
2819,JUST FOLKS,Then win from it what joy he can.
2820,JUST FOLKS,And he that battles with the odds
2821,JUST FOLKS,"Shall know success, but he who waits"
2822,JUST FOLKS,"The favors of the mystic gods,"
2823,JUST FOLKS,Shall never come to glory's gates.
2824,JUST FOLKS,
2825,JUST FOLKS,No man is greater than his will;
2826,JUST FOLKS,No gods to him will lend a hand!
2827,JUST FOLKS,Upon his courage and his skill
2828,JUST FOLKS,The record of his life must stand.
2829,JUST FOLKS,"What honors shall befall to him,"
2830,JUST FOLKS,"What he shall claim of fame or pelf,"
2831,JUST FOLKS,Depend not on the favoring whim
2832,JUST FOLKS,"Of fortune's god, but on himself."

2837,JUST FOLKS,The Auto
2838,JUST FOLKS,
2839,JUST FOLKS,An auto is a helpful thing;
2840,JUST FOLKS,"I love the way the motor hums,"
2841,JUST FOLKS,"I love each cushion and each spring,"
2842,JUST FOLKS,"The way it goes, the way it comes;"
2843,JUST FOLKS,"It saves me many a dreary mile,"
2844,JUST FOLKS,It brings me quickly to the smile
2845,JUST FOLKS,"Of those at home, and every day"
2846,JUST FOLKS,It adds unto my time for play.
2847,JUST FOLKS,
2848,JUST FOLKS,It keeps me with my friends in touch;
2849,JUST FOLKS,No journey now appears too much
2850,JUST FOLKS,To make with meetings at the end:
2851,JUST FOLKS,It gives me time to be a friend.
2852,JUST FOLKS,"It laughs at distance, and has power"
2853,JUST FOLKS,To lengthen every fleeting hour.
2854,JUST FOLKS,It bears me into country new
2855,JUST FOLKS,That otherwise I'd never view.
2856,JUST FOLKS,
2857,JUST FOLKS,It's swift and sturdy and it strives
2858,JUST FOLKS,To fill with happiness our lives;
2859,JUST FOLKS,When for the doctor we've a need
2860,JUST FOLKS,It brings him to our door with speed.
2861,JUST FOLKS,It saves us hours of anxious care
2862,JUST FOLKS,And heavy heartache and despair.
2863,JUST FOLKS,"It has its faults, but still I sing:"
2864,JUST FOLKS,The auto is a helpful thing.

2869,JUST FOLKS,The Handy Man
2870,JUST FOLKS,
2871,JUST FOLKS,The handy man about the house
2872,JUST FOLKS,Is old and bent and gray;
2873,JUST FOLKS,"Each morning in the yard he toils,"
2874,JUST FOLKS,Where all the children play;
2875,JUST FOLKS,"Some new task every day he finds,"
2876,JUST FOLKS,"Some task he loves to do,"
2877,JUST FOLKS,"The handy man about the house,"
2878,JUST FOLKS,Whose work is never through.
2879,JUST FOLKS,
2880,JUST FOLKS,"The children stand to see him toil,"
2881,JUST FOLKS,And watch him mend a chair;
2882,JUST FOLKS,They bring their broken toys to him
2883,JUST FOLKS,He keeps them in repair.
2884,JUST FOLKS,"No idle moment Grandpa spends,"
2885,JUST FOLKS,"But finds some work to do,"
2886,JUST FOLKS,"And hums a snatch of some old song,"
2887,JUST FOLKS,That in his youth he knew.
2888,JUST FOLKS,
2889,JUST FOLKS,He builds with wood most wondrous things:
2890,JUST FOLKS,"A table for the den,"
2891,JUST FOLKS,"A music rack to please the girls,"
2892,JUST FOLKS,A gun case for the men.
2893,JUST FOLKS,"And 'midst his paints and tools he smiles,"
2894,JUST FOLKS,And seems as young and gay
2895,JUST FOLKS,As any of the little ones
2896,JUST FOLKS,Who round him run in play.
2897,JUST FOLKS,
2898,JUST FOLKS,I stopped to speak with him awhile;
2899,JUST FOLKS,"""Oh, tell me, Grandpa, pray,"""
2900,JUST FOLKS,"I said, ""why do you work so hard"
2901,JUST FOLKS,Throughout the livelong day?
2902,JUST FOLKS,"Your hair is gray, your back is bent,"
2903,JUST FOLKS,With weight of years oppressed;
2904,JUST FOLKS,This is the evening of your life--
2905,JUST FOLKS,"Why don't you sit and rest?"""
2906,JUST FOLKS,
2907,JUST FOLKS,"""Ah, no,"" the old man answered me,"
2908,JUST FOLKS,"""Although I'm old and gray,"
2909,JUST FOLKS,I like to work out here where I
2910,JUST FOLKS,Can watch the children play.
2911,JUST FOLKS,The old have tasks that they must do;
2912,JUST FOLKS,The greatest of my joys
2913,JUST FOLKS,"Is working on this shaded porch,"
2914,JUST FOLKS,"And mending children's toys."""
2915,JUST FOLKS,
2916,JUST FOLKS,"And as I wandered on, I thought,"
2917,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, shall I lonely be"
2918,JUST FOLKS,"When time has powdered white my hair,"
2919,JUST FOLKS,And left his mark on me?
2920,JUST FOLKS,"Will little children round me play,"
2921,JUST FOLKS,Shall I have work to do?
2922,JUST FOLKS,"Or shall I be, when age is mine,"
2923,JUST FOLKS,Lonely and useless too?

2932,JUST FOLKS,"The days when every mead was fair, and every heart was true,"
2933,JUST FOLKS,"And every maiden wore a smile, and every sky was blue"
2934,JUST FOLKS,"The days when dreams were golden and every night brought rest,"
2935,JUST FOLKS,"The old, old days of youth and love, the days they say were best"
2936,JUST FOLKS,"But I--I sing the new days, the days that lie before,"

2938,JUST FOLKS,

2944,JUST FOLKS,"And maidens smile upon us all, the way they used to do,"
2945,JUST FOLKS,"Dreams we know are golden dreams, hope springs in every breast;"
2946,JUST FOLKS,It cheers us in the dewy morn and soothes us when we rest.
2947,JUST FOLKS,
2948,JUST FOLKS,"The new days, the new days, of them I want to sing,"
2949,JUST FOLKS,The new days with the fancies and the golden dreams they bring;
2950,JUST FOLKS,"The old days had their pleasures, but likewise have the new"
2951,JUST FOLKS,The gardens with their roses and the meadows bright with dew;
2952,JUST FOLKS,We love to-day the selfsame way they loved in days of old;

3028,JUST FOLKS,To satisfy another's need
3029,JUST FOLKS,Is now my daily chore.
3030,JUST FOLKS,"A growing family is ours,"

3051,JUST FOLKS,
3052,JUST FOLKS,"And yet I gladly stand the strain,"
3053,JUST FOLKS,"And count the task worth while,"
3054,JUST FOLKS,Nor will I dismally complain
3055,JUST FOLKS,While Buddy wears a smile.
3056,JUST FOLKS,What's one mouth more at any board
3057,JUST FOLKS,Though costly be the fare?
3058,JUST FOLKS,The poorest of us can afford

3069,JUST FOLKS,
3070,JUST FOLKS,"The little church of Long Ago, where as a boy I sat"
3071,JUST FOLKS,With mother in the family pew and fumbled with my hat--
3072,JUST FOLKS,"How I would like to see it now the way I saw it then,"
3073,JUST FOLKS,"The straight-backed pews, the pulpit high, the women and the men"
3074,JUST FOLKS,"Dressed stiffly in their Sunday clothes and solemnly devout,"
3075,JUST FOLKS,Who closed their eyes when prayers were said and never looked about--
3076,JUST FOLKS,"That little church of Long Ago, it wasn't grand to see,"
3077,JUST FOLKS,But even as a little boy it meant a lot to me.
3078,JUST FOLKS,
3079,JUST FOLKS,The choir loft where father sang comes back to me again;
3080,JUST FOLKS,I hear his tenor voice once more the way I heard it when
3081,JUST FOLKS,"The deacons used to pass the plate, and once again I see"
3082,JUST FOLKS,"The people fumbling for their coins, as glad as they could be"
3083,JUST FOLKS,"To drop their quarters on the plate, and I'm a boy once more"
3084,JUST FOLKS,With my two pennies in my fist that mother gave before
3085,JUST FOLKS,"We left the house, and once again I'm reaching out to try"
3086,JUST FOLKS,To drop them on the plate before the deacon passes by.
3087,JUST FOLKS,
3088,JUST FOLKS,"It seems to me I'm sitting in that high-backed pew, the while"
3089,JUST FOLKS,The minister is preaching in that good old-fashioned style;
3090,JUST FOLKS,And though I couldn't understand it all somehow I know
3091,JUST FOLKS,The Bible was the text book in that church of Long Ago;
3092,JUST FOLKS,"He didn't preach on politics, but used the word of God,"
3093,JUST FOLKS,"And even now I seem to see the people gravely nod,"
3094,JUST FOLKS,"As though agreeing thoroughly with all he had to say,"
3095,JUST FOLKS,And then I see them thanking him before they go away.
3096,JUST FOLKS,
3097,JUST FOLKS,"The little church of Long Ago was not a structure huge,"
3098,JUST FOLKS,It had no hired singers or no other subterfuge
3099,JUST FOLKS,"To get the people to attend, 'twas just a simple place"
3100,JUST FOLKS,Where every Sunday we were told about God's saving grace;
3101,JUST FOLKS,No men of wealth were gathered there to help it with a gift;
3102,JUST FOLKS,The only worldly thing it had--a mortgage hard to lift.
3103,JUST FOLKS,"And somehow, dreaming here to-day, I wish that I could know"
3104,JUST FOLKS,The joy of once more sitting in that church of Long Ago.

3114,JUST FOLKS,More settled-like. In these few days
3115,JUST FOLKS,"She's changed completely, an' her smile"
3116,JUST FOLKS,Has taken on the mother-style.
3117,JUST FOLKS,"Her voice is sweeter, an' her words"
3118,JUST FOLKS,Are clear as is the song of birds.
3119,JUST FOLKS,"She still is Sue, but not the same--"
3120,JUST FOLKS,She's different since the baby came.
3121,JUST FOLKS,
3122,JUST FOLKS,There is a calm upon her face
3123,JUST FOLKS,That marks the change that's taken place;
3124,JUST FOLKS,It seems as though her eyes now see
3125,JUST FOLKS,"The wonder things that are to be,"
3126,JUST FOLKS,An' that her gentle hands now own
3127,JUST FOLKS,A gentleness before unknown.
3128,JUST FOLKS,Her laughter has a clearer ring
3129,JUST FOLKS,"Than all the bubbling of a spring,"
3130,JUST FOLKS,An' in her cheeks love's tender flame
3131,JUST FOLKS,Glows brighter since the baby came.
3132,JUST FOLKS,
3133,JUST FOLKS,I look at her an' I can see
3134,JUST FOLKS,Her mother as she used to be.
3135,JUST FOLKS,"How sweet she was, an' yet how much"
3136,JUST FOLKS,She sweetened by the magic touch
3137,JUST FOLKS,That made her mother! In her face
3138,JUST FOLKS,It seemed the angels left a trace
3139,JUST FOLKS,Of Heavenly beauty to remain
3140,JUST FOLKS,Where once had been the lines of pain
3141,JUST FOLKS,An' with the baby in her arms
3142,JUST FOLKS,Enriched her with a thousand charms.
3143,JUST FOLKS,
3144,JUST FOLKS,Sue's got a baby now an' she
3145,JUST FOLKS,Is prettier than she used to be.
3146,JUST FOLKS,"A wondrous change has taken place,"
3147,JUST FOLKS,A softer beauty marks her face
3148,JUST FOLKS,An' in the warmth of her caress
3149,JUST FOLKS,"There seems the touch of holiness,"
3150,JUST FOLKS,An' all the charms her mother knew
3151,JUST FOLKS,Have blossomed once again in Sue.

3167,JUST FOLKS,To frighten the bears away.
3168,JUST FOLKS,
3169,JUST FOLKS,This land is reached by a wonderful ship

3173,JUST FOLKS,"And never a cross-patch journeys there,"

3175,JUST FOLKS,"For it is the Land of Smiling, where"
3176,JUST FOLKS,A frown is a big disgrace.
3177,JUST FOLKS,
3178,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, you board the ship when the sun goes down,"

3200,JUST FOLKS,
3201,JUST FOLKS,It may be I am getting old and like too much to dwell
3202,JUST FOLKS,"Upon the days of bygone years, the days I loved so well;"
3203,JUST FOLKS,But thinking of them now I wish somehow that I could know
3204,JUST FOLKS,"A simple old Thanksgiving Day, like those of long ago,"
3205,JUST FOLKS,"When all the family gathered round a table richly spread,"
3206,JUST FOLKS,"With little Jamie at the foot and grandpa at the head,"
3207,JUST FOLKS,"The youngest of us all to greet the oldest with a smile,"
3208,JUST FOLKS,With mother running in and out and laughing all the while.
3209,JUST FOLKS,
3210,JUST FOLKS,"It may be I'm old-fashioned, but it seems to me to-day"
3211,JUST FOLKS,We're too much bent on having fun to take the time to pray;
3212,JUST FOLKS,Each little family grows up with fashions of its own;
3213,JUST FOLKS,It lives within a world itself and wants to be alone.
3214,JUST FOLKS,"It has its special pleasures, its circle, too, of friends;"
3215,JUST FOLKS,"There are no get-together days; each one his journey wends,"
3216,JUST FOLKS,"Pursuing what he likes the best in his particular way,"
3217,JUST FOLKS,Letting the others do the same upon Thanksgiving Day.
3218,JUST FOLKS,
3219,JUST FOLKS,"I like the olden way the best, when relatives were glad"
3220,JUST FOLKS,To meet the way they used to do when I was but a lad;
3221,JUST FOLKS,"The old home was a rendezvous for all our kith and kin,"
3222,JUST FOLKS,And whether living far or near they all came trooping in
3223,JUST FOLKS,"With shouts of ""Hello, daddy!"" as they fairly stormed the place"
3224,JUST FOLKS,"And made a rush for mother, who would stop to wipe her face"
3225,JUST FOLKS,"Upon her gingham apron before she kissed them all,"
3226,JUST FOLKS,"Hugging them proudly to her breast, the grownups and the small."
3227,JUST FOLKS,
3228,JUST FOLKS,"Then laughter rang throughout the home, and, Oh, the jokes they told;"
3229,JUST FOLKS,"From Boston, Frank brought new ones, but father sprang the old;"
3230,JUST FOLKS,"All afternoon we chatted, telling what we hoped to do,"
3231,JUST FOLKS,The struggles we were making and the hardships we'd gone through;
3232,JUST FOLKS,We gathered round the fireside. How fast the hours would fly--
3233,JUST FOLKS,It seemed before we'd settled down 'twas time to say good-bye.
3234,JUST FOLKS,"Those were the glad Thanksgivings, the old-time families knew"

3241,JUST FOLKS,
3242,JUST FOLKS,"'Tis a little old house with a squeak in the stairs,"
3243,JUST FOLKS,And a porch that seems made for just two easy chairs;
3244,JUST FOLKS,"In the yard is a group of geraniums red,"
3245,JUST FOLKS,And a glorious old-fashioned peony bed.
3246,JUST FOLKS,Petunias and pansies and larkspurs are there
3247,JUST FOLKS,Proclaiming their love for the old-fashioned pair.
3248,JUST FOLKS,
3249,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, it's hard now to picture the peace of the place!"
3250,JUST FOLKS,Never lovelier smile lit a fair woman's face
3251,JUST FOLKS,Than the smile of the little old lady who sits
3252,JUST FOLKS,On the porch through the bright days of summer and knits.
3253,JUST FOLKS,And a courtlier manner no prince ever had
3254,JUST FOLKS,"Than the little old man that she speaks of as ""dad."""
3255,JUST FOLKS,
3256,JUST FOLKS,In that little old house there is nothing of hate;
3257,JUST FOLKS,There are old-fashioned things by an old-fashioned grate;
3258,JUST FOLKS,On the walls there are pictures of fine looking men
3259,JUST FOLKS,"And beautiful ladies to look at, and then"
3260,JUST FOLKS,Time has placed on the mantel to comfort them there
3261,JUST FOLKS,"The pictures of grandchildren, radiantly fair."
3262,JUST FOLKS,
3263,JUST FOLKS,"Every part of the house seems to whisper of joy,"
3264,JUST FOLKS,Save the trinkets that speak of a lost little boy.
3265,JUST FOLKS,"Yet Time has long since soothed the hurt and the pain,"
3266,JUST FOLKS,And his glorious memories only remain:
3267,JUST FOLKS,"The laughter of children the old walls have known,"
3268,JUST FOLKS,"And the joy of it stays, though the babies have flown."
3269,JUST FOLKS,
3270,JUST FOLKS,I am fond of that house and that old-fashioned pair
3271,JUST FOLKS,And the glorious calm that is hovering there.
3272,JUST FOLKS,The riches of life are not silver and gold
3273,JUST FOLKS,"But fine sons and daughters when we are grown old,"
3274,JUST FOLKS,And I pray when the years shall have silvered our hair
3275,JUST FOLKS,We shall know the delights of that old-fashioned pair.

3285,JUST FOLKS,And been boys and girls again.
3286,JUST FOLKS,"We have romped through orchards blazing,"
3287,JUST FOLKS,"Petted ponies gently grazing,"
3288,JUST FOLKS,"Hidden in the hayloft's spaces,"
3289,JUST FOLKS,And the queerest sort of places
3290,JUST FOLKS,That are lost (and it's a pity!)
3291,JUST FOLKS,To the youngsters in the city.
3292,JUST FOLKS,And the hired men have let us
3293,JUST FOLKS,"Drive their teams, and stopped to get us"
3294,JUST FOLKS,"Apples from the trees, and lingered"
3295,JUST FOLKS,While a cow's cool nose we fingered;
3296,JUST FOLKS,And they told us all about her
3297,JUST FOLKS,And her grandpa who was stouter.
3298,JUST FOLKS,
3299,JUST FOLKS,We've been out to Pelletier's
3300,JUST FOLKS,"Watching horses raise their ears,"
3301,JUST FOLKS,And their joyous whinnies hearing
3302,JUST FOLKS,When the man with oats was nearing.
3303,JUST FOLKS,We've been climbing trees an' fences
3304,JUST FOLKS,Never minding consequences.
3305,JUST FOLKS,And we helped the man to curry
3306,JUST FOLKS,The fat ponies' sides so furry.
3307,JUST FOLKS,And we saw a squirrel taking
3308,JUST FOLKS,"Walnuts to the nest he's making,"
3309,JUST FOLKS,"Storing them for winter, when he"
3310,JUST FOLKS,Can't get out to hunt for any.

3313,JUST FOLKS,That the reason they were living
3314,JUST FOLKS,Is to die for our Thanksgiving.
3315,JUST FOLKS,
3316,JUST FOLKS,"We've been out to Pelletier's,"
3317,JUST FOLKS,Brushing off the stain of years.
3318,JUST FOLKS,We were kids set free from shamming
3319,JUST FOLKS,"And the city's awful cramming,"
3320,JUST FOLKS,And the clamor and the bustle
3321,JUST FOLKS,And the fearful rush and hustle--
3322,JUST FOLKS,Out of doors with room to race in
3323,JUST FOLKS,And broad acres soft to chase in.
3324,JUST FOLKS,We just stretched our souls and let them
3325,JUST FOLKS,"Drop the petty cares that fret them,"
3326,JUST FOLKS,"Left our narrow thoughts behind us,"
3327,JUST FOLKS,Loosed the selfish traits that bind us
3328,JUST FOLKS,And were wholesomer and plainer
3329,JUST FOLKS,"Simpler, kinder folks and saner,"

3336,JUST FOLKS,At Christmas
3337,JUST FOLKS,
3338,JUST FOLKS,A man is at his finest towards the finish of the year;
3339,JUST FOLKS,He is almost what he should be when the Christmas season's here;
3340,JUST FOLKS,"Then he's thinking more of others than be's thought the months before,"
3341,JUST FOLKS,And the laughter of his children is a joy worth toiling for.
3342,JUST FOLKS,He is less a selfish creature than at any other time;
3343,JUST FOLKS,When the Christmas spirit rules him he comes close to the sublime.
3344,JUST FOLKS,
3345,JUST FOLKS,When it's Christmas man is bigger and is better in his part;
3346,JUST FOLKS,He is keener for the service that is prompted by the heart.
3347,JUST FOLKS,All the petty thoughts and narrow seem to vanish for awhile
3348,JUST FOLKS,And the true reward he's seeking is the glory of a smile.
3349,JUST FOLKS,Then for others he is toiling and somehow it seems to me
3350,JUST FOLKS,That at Christmas he is almost what God wanted him to be.
3351,JUST FOLKS,
3352,JUST FOLKS,If I had to paint a picture of a man I think I'd wait

3356,JUST FOLKS,"I'd not take him when he's sneering, when he's scornful or depressed,"
3357,JUST FOLKS,But I'd look for him at Christmas when he's shining at his best.
3358,JUST FOLKS,
3359,JUST FOLKS,Man is ever in a struggle and he's oft misunderstood;
3360,JUST FOLKS,"There are days the worst that's in him is the master of the good,"
3361,JUST FOLKS,But at Christmas kindness rules him and he puts himself aside
3362,JUST FOLKS,And his petty hates are vanquished and his heart is opened wide.
3363,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, I don't know how to say it, but somehow it seems to me"

3372,JUST FOLKS,Childhood never comes again.
3373,JUST FOLKS,Live it gayly while you may;
3374,JUST FOLKS,Give your baby souls to play;
3375,JUST FOLKS,"March to sound of stick and pan,"
3376,JUST FOLKS,"In your paper hats, and tramp"
3377,JUST FOLKS,just as bravely as you can
3378,JUST FOLKS,To your pleasant little camp.
3379,JUST FOLKS,Wooden sword and wooden gun
3380,JUST FOLKS,Make a battle splendid fun.
3381,JUST FOLKS,Fine the victories you win
3382,JUST FOLKS,Dimpled cheek and dimpled chin.
3383,JUST FOLKS,
3384,JUST FOLKS,"Little women, little men,"
3385,JUST FOLKS,Hearts are light when years are ten;
3386,JUST FOLKS,Eyes are bright and cheeks are red
3387,JUST FOLKS,When life's cares lie all ahead.
3388,JUST FOLKS,Drums make merry music when
3389,JUST FOLKS,They are leading children out;
3390,JUST FOLKS,"Trumpet calls are cheerful then,"
3391,JUST FOLKS,Glorious is the battle shout.
3392,JUST FOLKS,"Little soldiers, single file,"
3393,JUST FOLKS,"Uniformed in grin and smile,"
3394,JUST FOLKS,Conquer every foe they meet
3395,JUST FOLKS,Up and down the gentle street.
3396,JUST FOLKS,
3397,JUST FOLKS,"Little women, little men,"
3398,JUST FOLKS,Would that youth could come again!
3399,JUST FOLKS,Would that I might fall in line
3400,JUST FOLKS,"As a little boy of nine,"
3401,JUST FOLKS,"But with broomstick for a gun,"
3402,JUST FOLKS,And with paper hat that I
3403,JUST FOLKS,"Bravely wore back there for fun,"
3404,JUST FOLKS,Never more may I defy
3405,JUST FOLKS,Foes that deep in ambush kneel--
3406,JUST FOLKS,Now my warfare's grim and real.
3407,JUST FOLKS,"I that once was brave and bold,"
3408,JUST FOLKS,"Now am battered, bruised and old."
3409,JUST FOLKS,
3410,JUST FOLKS,"Little women, little men,"
3411,JUST FOLKS,"Planning to attack my den,"
3412,JUST FOLKS,Little do you know the joy
3413,JUST FOLKS,That you give a worn-out boy
3414,JUST FOLKS,As he hears your gentle feet
3415,JUST FOLKS,Pitter-patting in the hall;
3416,JUST FOLKS,Gladly does he wait to meet
3417,JUST FOLKS,Conquest by a troop so small.
3418,JUST FOLKS,"Dimpled cheek and dimpled chin,"
3419,JUST FOLKS,You have but to smile to win.
3420,JUST FOLKS,Come and take him where he stays
3421,JUST FOLKS,Dreaming of his by-gone days.
3422,JUST FOLKS,
3423,JUST FOLKS,
3424,JUST FOLKS,
3425,JUST FOLKS,
3426,JUST FOLKS,Who Is Your Boss?
3427,JUST FOLKS,
3428,JUST FOLKS,"""I work for someone else,"" he said;"
3429,JUST FOLKS,"""I have no chance to get ahead."
3430,JUST FOLKS,At night I leave the job behind;
3431,JUST FOLKS,At morn I face the same old grind.
3432,JUST FOLKS,And everything I do by day
3433,JUST FOLKS,Just brings to me the same old pay.
3434,JUST FOLKS,While I am here I cannot see
3435,JUST FOLKS,"The semblance of a chance for me."""
3436,JUST FOLKS,
3437,JUST FOLKS,I asked another how he viewed
3438,JUST FOLKS,The occupation he pursued.
3439,JUST FOLKS,"""It's dull and dreary toil,"" said he,"
3440,JUST FOLKS,"""And brings but small reward to me."
3441,JUST FOLKS,My boss gets all the profits fine
3442,JUST FOLKS,That I believe are rightly mine.
3443,JUST FOLKS,My life's monotonously grim
3444,JUST FOLKS,"Because I'm forced to work for him."""
3445,JUST FOLKS,
3446,JUST FOLKS,I stopped a third young man to ask
3447,JUST FOLKS,His attitude towards his task.
3448,JUST FOLKS,A cheerful smile lit up his face;
3449,JUST FOLKS,"""I shan't be always in this place,"""
3450,JUST FOLKS,"He said, ""because some distant day"
3451,JUST FOLKS,"A better job will come my way."""
3452,JUST FOLKS,"""Your boss?"" I asked, and answered he:"
3453,JUST FOLKS,"""I'm going to make him notice me."
3454,JUST FOLKS,
3455,JUST FOLKS,"""He pays me wages and in turn"
3456,JUST FOLKS,"That money I am here to earn,"
3457,JUST FOLKS,But I don't work for him alone;
3458,JUST FOLKS,Allegiance to myself I own.
3459,JUST FOLKS,I do not do my best because
3460,JUST FOLKS,It gets me favors or applause--
3461,JUST FOLKS,"I work for him, but I can see"
3462,JUST FOLKS,That actually I work for me.
3463,JUST FOLKS,
3464,JUST FOLKS,"""It looks like business good to me"
3465,JUST FOLKS,The best clerk on the staff to be.
3466,JUST FOLKS,If customers approve my style
3467,JUST FOLKS,And like my manner and my smile
3468,JUST FOLKS,"I help the firm to get the pelf,"
3469,JUST FOLKS,But what is more I help myself.
3470,JUST FOLKS,From one big thought I'm never free:
3471,JUST FOLKS,"That every day I work for me."""
3472,JUST FOLKS,
3473,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, youth, thought I, you're bound to climb"
3474,JUST FOLKS,The ladder of success in time.
3475,JUST FOLKS,Too many self-impose the cross
3476,JUST FOLKS,"Of daily working for a boss,"
3477,JUST FOLKS,Forgetting that in failing him
3478,JUST FOLKS,It is their own stars that they dim.
3479,JUST FOLKS,And when real service they refuse
3480,JUST FOLKS,They are the ones who really lose.

3484,JUST FOLKS,
3485,JUST FOLKS,The Truth About Envy
3486,JUST FOLKS,
3487,JUST FOLKS,"I like to see the flowers grow,"
3488,JUST FOLKS,To see the pansies in a row;
3489,JUST FOLKS,"I think a well-kept garden's fine,"
3490,JUST FOLKS,And wish that such a one were mine;
3491,JUST FOLKS,But one can't have a stock of flowers
3492,JUST FOLKS,Unless he digs and digs for hours.
3493,JUST FOLKS,
3494,JUST FOLKS,My ground is always bleak and bare;
3495,JUST FOLKS,The roses do not flourish there.
3496,JUST FOLKS,And where I once sowed poppy seeds
3497,JUST FOLKS,Is now a tangled mass of weeds.'
3498,JUST FOLKS,"I'm fond of flowers, but admit,"
3499,JUST FOLKS,For digging I don't care a bit.
3500,JUST FOLKS,
3501,JUST FOLKS,"I envy men whose yards are gay,"
3502,JUST FOLKS,But never work as hard as they;
3503,JUST FOLKS,I also envy men who own
3504,JUST FOLKS,More wealth than I have ever known.
3505,JUST FOLKS,I'm like a lot of men who yearn
3506,JUST FOLKS,For joys that they refuse to earn.
3507,JUST FOLKS,
3508,JUST FOLKS,You cannot have the joys of work
3509,JUST FOLKS,And take the comfort of a shirk.
3510,JUST FOLKS,I find the man I envy most
3511,JUST FOLKS,Is he who's longest at his post.
3512,JUST FOLKS,"I could have gold and roses, too,"
3513,JUST FOLKS,If I would work like those who do.
3514,JUST FOLKS,
3515,JUST FOLKS,
3516,JUST FOLKS,
3517,JUST FOLKS,
3518,JUST FOLKS,Living
3519,JUST FOLKS,
3520,JUST FOLKS,If through the years we're not to do
3521,JUST FOLKS,Much finer deeds than we have done;
3522,JUST FOLKS,If we must merely wander through
3523,JUST FOLKS,"Time's garden, idling in the sun;"
3524,JUST FOLKS,"If there is nothing big ahead,"
3525,JUST FOLKS,Why do we fear to join the dead?
3526,JUST FOLKS,
3527,JUST FOLKS,Unless to-morrow means that we
3528,JUST FOLKS,Shall do some needed service here;
3529,JUST FOLKS,That tasks are waiting you and me
3530,JUST FOLKS,"That will be lost, save we appear;"
3531,JUST FOLKS,Then why this dreadful thought of sorrow
3532,JUST FOLKS,That we may never see to-morrow?
3533,JUST FOLKS,
3534,JUST FOLKS,"If all our finest deeds are done,"
3535,JUST FOLKS,And all our splendor's in the past;
3536,JUST FOLKS,"If there's no battle to be won,"
3537,JUST FOLKS,What matter if to-day's our last?
3538,JUST FOLKS,Is life so sweet that we would live
3539,JUST FOLKS,Though nothing back to life we give?
3540,JUST FOLKS,
3541,JUST FOLKS,It is not greatness to have clung
3542,JUST FOLKS,To life through eighty fruitless years;
3543,JUST FOLKS,"The man who dies in action, young,"
3544,JUST FOLKS,"Deserves our praises and our cheers,"
3545,JUST FOLKS,Who ventures all for one great deed
3546,JUST FOLKS,And gives his life to serve life's need.

3551,JUST FOLKS,On Being Broke
3552,JUST FOLKS,
3553,JUST FOLKS,"Don't mind being broke at all,"
3554,JUST FOLKS,When I can say that what I had
3555,JUST FOLKS,Was spent for toys for kiddies small
3556,JUST FOLKS,And that the spending made 'em glad.
3557,JUST FOLKS,"I don't regret the money gone,"
3558,JUST FOLKS,If happiness it left behind.
3559,JUST FOLKS,An empty purse I'll look upon
3560,JUST FOLKS,"Contented, if its record's kind."
3561,JUST FOLKS,"There's no disgrace in being broke,"
3562,JUST FOLKS,Unless it's due to flying high;
3563,JUST FOLKS,"Though poverty is not a joke,"
3564,JUST FOLKS,"The only thing that counts is ""why?"""
3565,JUST FOLKS,
3566,JUST FOLKS,The dollars come to me and go;
3567,JUST FOLKS,To-day I've eight or ten to spend;
3568,JUST FOLKS,"To-morrow I'll be sailing low,"
3569,JUST FOLKS,And have to lean upon a friend.
3570,JUST FOLKS,But if that little bunch of mine
3571,JUST FOLKS,"Is richer by some toy or frill,"
3572,JUST FOLKS,I'll face the world and never whine
3573,JUST FOLKS,Because I lack a dollar bill.
3574,JUST FOLKS,"I'm satisfied, if I can see"
3575,JUST FOLKS,One smile that hadn't bloomed before.
3576,JUST FOLKS,The only thing that counts with me
3577,JUST FOLKS,Is what I've spent my money for.
3578,JUST FOLKS,
3579,JUST FOLKS,"I might regret my sorry plight,"
3580,JUST FOLKS,If selfishness brought it about;
3581,JUST FOLKS,"If for the fun I had last night,"
3582,JUST FOLKS,Some joy they'd have to go without.
3583,JUST FOLKS,"But if I've swapped my bit of gold,"
3584,JUST FOLKS,For laughter and a happier pack
3585,JUST FOLKS,Of youngsters in my little fold
3586,JUST FOLKS,I'll never wish those dollars back.
3587,JUST FOLKS,If I have traded coin for things
3588,JUST FOLKS,"They needed and have left them glad,"
3589,JUST FOLKS,Then being broke no sorrow brings--
3590,JUST FOLKS,I've done my best with what I had.
3591,JUST FOLKS,
3592,JUST FOLKS,
3593,JUST FOLKS,
3594,JUST FOLKS,
3595,JUST FOLKS,The Broken Drum
3596,JUST FOLKS,
3597,JUST FOLKS,There is sorrow in the household;
3598,JUST FOLKS,There's a grief too hard to bear;
3599,JUST FOLKS,There's a little cheek that's tear-stained
3600,JUST FOLKS,There's a sobbing baby there.
3601,JUST FOLKS,"And try how we will to comfort,"
3602,JUST FOLKS,Still the tiny teardrops come;
3603,JUST FOLKS,"For, to solve a vexing problem,"
3604,JUST FOLKS,Curly Locks has wrecked his drum.
3605,JUST FOLKS,
3606,JUST FOLKS,"It had puzzled him and worried,"
3607,JUST FOLKS,How the drum created sound;
3608,JUST FOLKS,For he couldn't understand it
3609,JUST FOLKS,It was not enough to pound
3610,JUST FOLKS,"With his tiny hands and drumsticks,"
3611,JUST FOLKS,"And at last the day has come,"
3612,JUST FOLKS,When another hope is shattered;
3613,JUST FOLKS,Now in ruins lies his drum.
3614,JUST FOLKS,
3615,JUST FOLKS,"With his metal bank he broke it,"
3616,JUST FOLKS,"Tore the tightened skin aside,"
3617,JUST FOLKS,"Gazed on vacant space bewildered,"
3618,JUST FOLKS,Then he broke right down and cried.
3619,JUST FOLKS,For the broken bubble shocked him
3620,JUST FOLKS,And the baby tears must come;
3621,JUST FOLKS,Now a joy has gone forever:
3622,JUST FOLKS,Curly Locks has wrecked his drum.
3623,JUST FOLKS,
3624,JUST FOLKS,"While his mother tries to soothe him,"
3625,JUST FOLKS,I am sitting here alone;
3626,JUST FOLKS,In the life that lies behind me;
3627,JUST FOLKS,Many shocks like that I've known.
3628,JUST FOLKS,"And the boy who's upstairs weeping,"
3629,JUST FOLKS,In the years that are to come
3630,JUST FOLKS,Will learn that many pleasures
3631,JUST FOLKS,Are as empty as his drum.
3632,JUST FOLKS,
3633,JUST FOLKS,
3634,JUST FOLKS,
3635,JUST FOLKS,
3636,JUST FOLKS,Mother's Excuses
3637,JUST FOLKS,
3638,JUST FOLKS,Mother for me made excuses
3639,JUST FOLKS,When I was a little tad;
3640,JUST FOLKS,Found some reason for my conduct
3641,JUST FOLKS,When it had been very bad.
3642,JUST FOLKS,Blamed it on a recent illness
3643,JUST FOLKS,Or my nervousness and told
3644,JUST FOLKS,Father to be easy with me
3645,JUST FOLKS,Every time he had to scold.
3646,JUST FOLKS,
3647,JUST FOLKS,"And I knew, as well as any"
3648,JUST FOLKS,"Roguish, healthy lad of ten,"
3649,JUST FOLKS,Mother really wasn't telling
3650,JUST FOLKS,Truthful things to father then.
3651,JUST FOLKS,"I knew I deserved the whipping,"
3652,JUST FOLKS,"Knew that I'd been very bad,"
3653,JUST FOLKS,Knew that mother knew it also
3654,JUST FOLKS,When she intervened with dad.
3655,JUST FOLKS,
3656,JUST FOLKS,I knew that my recent illness
3657,JUST FOLKS,Hadn't anything to do
3658,JUST FOLKS,"With the mischief I'd been up to,"
3659,JUST FOLKS,And I knew that mother knew.
3660,JUST FOLKS,But remembering my fever
3661,JUST FOLKS,"And my nervous temperament,"
3662,JUST FOLKS,Father put away the shingle
3663,JUST FOLKS,And postponed the sad event.
3664,JUST FOLKS,
3665,JUST FOLKS,"Now his mother, when I threaten"
3666,JUST FOLKS,"Punishment for this and that,"
3667,JUST FOLKS,Calls to mind the dreary night hours
3668,JUST FOLKS,When beside his bed we sat.
3669,JUST FOLKS,"Comes and tells me that he's nervous,"
3670,JUST FOLKS,"That's the reason he was bad,"
3671,JUST FOLKS,And the boy and doting mother
3672,JUST FOLKS,Put it over on the dad.
3673,JUST FOLKS,
3674,JUST FOLKS,"Some day when he's grown as I am,"
3675,JUST FOLKS,"With a boy on mischief bent,"
3676,JUST FOLKS,He will hear the timeworn story
3677,JUST FOLKS,Of the nervous temperament.
3678,JUST FOLKS,And remembering the shingle
3679,JUST FOLKS,"That aside I always threw,"
3680,JUST FOLKS,All I hope is that he'll let them
3681,JUST FOLKS,"Put it over on him, too."
3682,JUST FOLKS,
3683,JUST FOLKS,
3684,JUST FOLKS,
3685,JUST FOLKS,
3686,JUST FOLKS,As It Is
3687,JUST FOLKS,
3688,JUST FOLKS,"I might wish the world were better,"
3689,JUST FOLKS,I might sit around and sigh
3690,JUST FOLKS,For a water that is wetter
3691,JUST FOLKS,And a bluer sort of sky.
3692,JUST FOLKS,There are times I think the weather
3693,JUST FOLKS,"Could be much improved upon,"
3694,JUST FOLKS,But when taken altogether
3695,JUST FOLKS,It's a good old world we're on.
3696,JUST FOLKS,"I might tell how I would make it,"
3697,JUST FOLKS,But when I have had my say
3698,JUST FOLKS,It is still my job to take it
3699,JUST FOLKS,"As it is, from day to day."
3700,JUST FOLKS,
3701,JUST FOLKS,"I might wish that men were kinder,"
3702,JUST FOLKS,And less eager after gold;
3703,JUST FOLKS,I might wish that they were blinder
3704,JUST FOLKS,To the faults they now behold.
3705,JUST FOLKS,"And I'd try to make them gentle,"
3706,JUST FOLKS,And more tolerant in strife
3707,JUST FOLKS,And a bit more sentimental
3708,JUST FOLKS,O'er the finer things of life.
3709,JUST FOLKS,"But I am not here to make them,"
3710,JUST FOLKS,Or to work in human clay;
3711,JUST FOLKS,It is just my work to take them
3712,JUST FOLKS,As they are from day to day.
3713,JUST FOLKS,
3714,JUST FOLKS,"Here's a world that suffers sorrow,"
3715,JUST FOLKS,"Here are bitterness and pain,"
3716,JUST FOLKS,And the joy we plan to-morrow
3717,JUST FOLKS,May be ruined by the rain.
3718,JUST FOLKS,"Here are hate and greed and badness,"
3719,JUST FOLKS,"Here are love and friendship, too,"
3720,JUST FOLKS,But the most of it is gladness
3721,JUST FOLKS,When at last we've run it through.
3722,JUST FOLKS,Could we only understand it
3723,JUST FOLKS,As we shall some distant day
3724,JUST FOLKS,We should see that He who planned it
3725,JUST FOLKS,Knew our needs along the way.

3734,JUST FOLKS,Lovelier than any queen

3736,JUST FOLKS,"Girls with curls go walking by,"
3737,JUST FOLKS,"Dainty, graceful, bold an' shy,"

3742,JUST FOLKS,Is Ma.
3743,JUST FOLKS,Sweetest girl to look upon

3745,JUST FOLKS,"Seen 'em short and seen 'em tall,"
3746,JUST FOLKS,"Seen 'em big and seen 'em small,"
3747,JUST FOLKS,But the finest one of all
3748,JUST FOLKS,Is Ma.
3749,JUST FOLKS,
3750,JUST FOLKS,Best of all the girls on earth
3751,JUST FOLKS,Is Ma.
3752,JUST FOLKS,One that all the rest is worth

3754,JUST FOLKS,"Some have beauty, some have grace,"
3755,JUST FOLKS,"Some look nice in silk and lace,"
3756,JUST FOLKS,But the one that takes first place
3757,JUST FOLKS,Is Ma.
3758,JUST FOLKS,
3759,JUST FOLKS,Sweetest singer in the land
3760,JUST FOLKS,is Ma.
3761,JUST FOLKS,She that has the softest hand

3763,JUST FOLKS,"Tenderest, gentlest nurse is she,"
3764,JUST FOLKS,"Full of fun as she can be,"
3765,JUST FOLKS,An' the only girl for me
3766,JUST FOLKS,Is Ma.

3769,JUST FOLKS,It's Ma.'
3770,JUST FOLKS,"if God has a sweetheart dear,"

3772,JUST FOLKS,"Take the girls that artists draw,"
3773,JUST FOLKS,"An' all the girls I ever saw,"
3774,JUST FOLKS,The only one without a flaw
3775,JUST FOLKS,Is Ma.

3787,JUST FOLKS,"""Away up!"" he cries."
3788,JUST FOLKS,Who could be doubting

3791,JUST FOLKS,And heigho! my son!
3792,JUST FOLKS,Up to the ceiling
3793,JUST FOLKS,Is wonderful fun.
3794,JUST FOLKS,
3795,JUST FOLKS,Bigger than daddy
3796,JUST FOLKS,And bigger than mother;
3797,JUST FOLKS,"Only a laddie,"

3799,JUST FOLKS,Laughing and crowing
3800,JUST FOLKS,"And squirming and wriggling,"
3801,JUST FOLKS,"Cheeks fairly glowing,"
3802,JUST FOLKS,Now cooing and giggling!
3803,JUST FOLKS,"Down to the cellar,"
3804,JUST FOLKS,Then quick as a dart
3805,JUST FOLKS,Up to the ceiling
3806,JUST FOLKS,Brings joy to the heart.

3826,JUST FOLKS,"Gettin' together to smile an' rejoice,"
3827,JUST FOLKS,An' eatin' an' laughin' with folks of your choice;
3828,JUST FOLKS,An' kissin' the girls an' declarin' that they
3829,JUST FOLKS,Are growin more beautiful day after day;
3830,JUST FOLKS,"Chattin' an' braggin' a bit with the men,"
3831,JUST FOLKS,Buildin' the old family circle again;
3832,JUST FOLKS,"Livin' the wholesome an' old-fashioned cheer,"
3833,JUST FOLKS,Just for awhile at the end of the year.
3834,JUST FOLKS,
3835,JUST FOLKS,Greetings fly fast as we crowd through the door
3836,JUST FOLKS,And under the old roof we gather once more
3837,JUST FOLKS,Just as we did when the youngsters were small;
3838,JUST FOLKS,"Mother's a little bit grayer, that's all."
3839,JUST FOLKS,"Father's a little bit older, but still"
3840,JUST FOLKS,Ready to romp an' to laugh with a will.
3841,JUST FOLKS,Here we are back at the table again
3842,JUST FOLKS,Tellin' our stories as women an men.
3843,JUST FOLKS,
3844,JUST FOLKS,Bowed are our heads for a moment in prayer;
3845,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, but we're grateful an' glad to be there."
3846,JUST FOLKS,"Home from the east land an' home from the west,"
3847,JUST FOLKS,Home with the folks that are dearest an' best.
3848,JUST FOLKS,Out of the sham of the cities afar
3849,JUST FOLKS,We've come for a time to be just what we are.
3850,JUST FOLKS,"Here we can talk of ourselves an' be frank,"
3851,JUST FOLKS,Forgettin' position an' station an' rank.
3852,JUST FOLKS,
3853,JUST FOLKS,Give me the end of the year an' its fun
3854,JUST FOLKS,When most of the plannin' an' toilin' is done;
3855,JUST FOLKS,"Bring all the wanderers home to the nest,"
3856,JUST FOLKS,"Let me sit down with the ones I love best,"
3857,JUST FOLKS,"Hear the old voices still ringin' with song,"
3858,JUST FOLKS,"See the old faces unblemished by wrong,"
3859,JUST FOLKS,See the old table with all of its chairs
3860,JUST FOLKS,An I'll put soul in my Thanksgivin' prayers.

3865,JUST FOLKS,The Boy Soldier
3866,JUST FOLKS,
3867,JUST FOLKS,Each evening on my lap there climbs
3868,JUST FOLKS,"A little boy of three,"
3869,JUST FOLKS,"And with his dimpled, chubby fists"
3870,JUST FOLKS,He pounds me shamefully.
3871,JUST FOLKS,"He gives my beard a vicious tug,"
3872,JUST FOLKS,He bravely pulls my nose;
3873,JUST FOLKS,And then he tussles with my hair
3874,JUST FOLKS,And then explores my clothes.
3875,JUST FOLKS,
3876,JUST FOLKS,He throws my pencils on the floor
3877,JUST FOLKS,My watch is his delight;
3878,JUST FOLKS,He never seems to think that I
3879,JUST FOLKS,Have any private right.
3880,JUST FOLKS,"And though he breaks my good cigars,"
3881,JUST FOLKS,"With all his cunning art,"
3882,JUST FOLKS,"He works a greater ruin, far,"
3883,JUST FOLKS,Deep down within my heart.
3884,JUST FOLKS,
3885,JUST FOLKS,This roguish little tyke who sits
3886,JUST FOLKS,"Each night upon my knee,"
3887,JUST FOLKS,"And hammers at his poor old dad,"
3888,JUST FOLKS,Is bound to conquer me.
3889,JUST FOLKS,"He little knows that long ago,"
3890,JUST FOLKS,"He forced the gates apart,"
3891,JUST FOLKS,And marched triumphantly into
3892,JUST FOLKS,The city of my heart.
3893,JUST FOLKS,
3894,JUST FOLKS,"Some day perhaps, in years to come,"
3895,JUST FOLKS,"When he is older grown,"
3896,JUST FOLKS,"He, too, will be assailed as I,"
3897,JUST FOLKS,By youngsters of his own.
3898,JUST FOLKS,And when at last a little lad
3899,JUST FOLKS,"Gives battle on his knee,"
3900,JUST FOLKS,"I know that he'll be captured, too,"
3901,JUST FOLKS,Just as he captured me.
3902,JUST FOLKS,
3903,JUST FOLKS,
3904,JUST FOLKS,

3906,JUST FOLKS,My Land
3907,JUST FOLKS,
3908,JUST FOLKS,"My land is where the kind folks are,"
3909,JUST FOLKS,"And where the friends are true,"
3910,JUST FOLKS,Where comrades brave will travel far
3911,JUST FOLKS,Some kindly deed to do.
3912,JUST FOLKS,My land is where the smiles are bright
3913,JUST FOLKS,"And where the speech is sweet,"
3914,JUST FOLKS,And where men cling to what is right
3915,JUST FOLKS,Regardless of defeat.
3916,JUST FOLKS,
3917,JUST FOLKS,My land is where the starry flag
3918,JUST FOLKS,Gleams brightly in the sun;
3919,JUST FOLKS,"The land of rugged mountain crag,"
3920,JUST FOLKS,"The land where rivers run,"
3921,JUST FOLKS,Where cheeks are tanned and hearts are bold
3922,JUST FOLKS,"And women fair to see,"
3923,JUST FOLKS,And all is not a strife for gold--
3924,JUST FOLKS,That land is home to me.
3925,JUST FOLKS,
3926,JUST FOLKS,"My land is where the children play,"
3927,JUST FOLKS,"And where the roses bloom,"
3928,JUST FOLKS,And where to break the peaceful day
3929,JUST FOLKS,No flaming cannons boom.
3930,JUST FOLKS,"My land's the land of honest toil,"
3931,JUST FOLKS,"Of laughter, dance and song,"
3932,JUST FOLKS,Where harvests crown the fertile soil
3933,JUST FOLKS,And thoughtful are the strong.
3934,JUST FOLKS,
3935,JUST FOLKS,My land's the land of many creeds
3936,JUST FOLKS,And tolerance for all
3937,JUST FOLKS,It is the land of 'splendid deeds
3938,JUST FOLKS,Where men are seldom small.
3939,JUST FOLKS,"And though the world should bid me roam,"
3940,JUST FOLKS,"Its distant scenes to see,"
3941,JUST FOLKS,My land would keep my heart at home
3942,JUST FOLKS,And there I'd always be.

3947,JUST FOLKS,Daddies
3948,JUST FOLKS,
3949,JUST FOLKS,I would rather be the daddy
3950,JUST FOLKS,"Of a romping, roguish crew,"
3951,JUST FOLKS,Of a bright-eyed chubby laddie
3952,JUST FOLKS,"And a little girl or two,"
3953,JUST FOLKS,Than the monarch of a nation
3954,JUST FOLKS,In his high and lofty seat
3955,JUST FOLKS,Taking empty adoration
3956,JUST FOLKS,From the subjects at his feet.
3957,JUST FOLKS,
3958,JUST FOLKS,I would rather own their kisses
3959,JUST FOLKS,"As at night to me they run,"
3960,JUST FOLKS,Than to be the king who misses
3961,JUST FOLKS,All the simpler forms of fun.
3962,JUST FOLKS,When his dreary day is ending
3963,JUST FOLKS,"He is dismally alone,"
3964,JUST FOLKS,But when my sun is descending
3965,JUST FOLKS,There are joys for me to own.
3966,JUST FOLKS,
3967,JUST FOLKS,He may ride to horns and drumming;
3968,JUST FOLKS,"I must walk a quiet street,"
3969,JUST FOLKS,But when once they see me coming
3970,JUST FOLKS,"Then on joyous, flying feet"
3971,JUST FOLKS,They come racing to me madly
3972,JUST FOLKS,And I catch them with a swing
3973,JUST FOLKS,"And I say it proudly, gladly,"
3974,JUST FOLKS,That I'm happier than a king.
3975,JUST FOLKS,
3976,JUST FOLKS,"You may talk of lofty places,"
3977,JUST FOLKS,"You may boast of pomp and power,"
3978,JUST FOLKS,Men may turn their eager faces
3979,JUST FOLKS,"To the glory of an hour,"
3980,JUST FOLKS,But give me the humble station
3981,JUST FOLKS,"With its joys that long survive,"
3982,JUST FOLKS,For the daddies of the nation
3983,JUST FOLKS,Are the happiest men alive.

3991,JUST FOLKS,"Flat on my back at ease,"
3992,JUST FOLKS,"Lulled by the hum of bees,"
3993,JUST FOLKS,There's where I rest;
3994,JUST FOLKS,"Breathing the scented air,"
3995,JUST FOLKS,"Lazily loafing there,"
3996,JUST FOLKS,"Never a thought of care,"
3997,JUST FOLKS,Peace in my breast.
3998,JUST FOLKS,
3999,JUST FOLKS,"There where the waters run,"
4000,JUST FOLKS,"Laughing along in fun,"
4001,JUST FOLKS,"I go when work is done,"
4002,JUST FOLKS,There's where I stray;
4003,JUST FOLKS,"Couch of a downy green,"
4004,JUST FOLKS,"Restful and sweet and clean,"
4005,JUST FOLKS,"Set in a fairy scene,"
4006,JUST FOLKS,Wondrously gay.
4007,JUST FOLKS,
4008,JUST FOLKS,"Worn out with toil and strife,"
4009,JUST FOLKS,"Sick of the din of life,"
4010,JUST FOLKS,"With pain and sorrow rife,"
4011,JUST FOLKS,There's where I go;
4012,JUST FOLKS,"Soothing and sweet I find,"
4013,JUST FOLKS,"Comforts that ease the mind,"
4014,JUST FOLKS,"Leaving dull care behind,"
4015,JUST FOLKS,Rest there I know.
4016,JUST FOLKS,
4017,JUST FOLKS,"Flat on my back I lie,"
4018,JUST FOLKS,"Watching the ships go by,"
4019,JUST FOLKS,"Under the fleecy sky,"
4020,JUST FOLKS,Day dreaming there;
4021,JUST FOLKS,"From grief I find surcease,"
4022,JUST FOLKS,"From worry gain release,"
4023,JUST FOLKS,"Resting in perfect peace,"
4024,JUST FOLKS,Free from all care.

4029,JUST FOLKS,When Father Played Baseball
4030,JUST FOLKS,
4031,JUST FOLKS,"The smell of arnica is strong,"
4032,JUST FOLKS,And mother's time is spent
4033,JUST FOLKS,In rubbing father's arms and back
4034,JUST FOLKS,With burning liniment.
4035,JUST FOLKS,The house is like a druggist's shop;
4036,JUST FOLKS,"Strong odors fill the hall,"
4037,JUST FOLKS,"And day and night we hear him groan,"
4038,JUST FOLKS,Since father played baseball.
4039,JUST FOLKS,
4040,JUST FOLKS,"He's forty past, but he declared"
4041,JUST FOLKS,That he was young as ever;
4042,JUST FOLKS,"And in his youth, he said, he was"
4043,JUST FOLKS,A baseball player clever.
4044,JUST FOLKS,So when the business men arranged
4045,JUST FOLKS,"A game, they came to call"
4046,JUST FOLKS,On dad and asked him if he thought
4047,JUST FOLKS,That he could play baseball.
4048,JUST FOLKS,
4049,JUST FOLKS,"""I haven't played in fifteen years,"""
4050,JUST FOLKS,"Said father, ""but I know"
4051,JUST FOLKS,"That I can stop the grounders hot,"
4052,JUST FOLKS,And I can make the throw.
4053,JUST FOLKS,I used to play a corking game;
4054,JUST FOLKS,"The curves, I know them all;"
4055,JUST FOLKS,"And you can count on me, you bet,"
4056,JUST FOLKS,"To join your game of ball."""
4057,JUST FOLKS,
4058,JUST FOLKS,"On Saturday the game was played,"
4059,JUST FOLKS,And all of us were there;
4060,JUST FOLKS,"Dad borrowed an old uniform,"
4061,JUST FOLKS,That Casey used to wear.
4062,JUST FOLKS,"He paid three dollars for a glove,"
4063,JUST FOLKS,Wore spikes to save a fall
4064,JUST FOLKS,"He had the make-up on all right,"
4065,JUST FOLKS,When father played baseball.
4066,JUST FOLKS,
4067,JUST FOLKS,At second base they stationed him;
4068,JUST FOLKS,A liner came his way;
4069,JUST FOLKS,"Dad tried to stop it with his knee,"
4070,JUST FOLKS,And missed a double play.
4071,JUST FOLKS,"He threw into the bleachers twice,"
4072,JUST FOLKS,He let a pop fly fall;
4073,JUST FOLKS,"Oh, we were all ashamed of him,"
4074,JUST FOLKS,When father played baseball.
4075,JUST FOLKS,
4076,JUST FOLKS,"He tried to run, but tripped and fell,"
4077,JUST FOLKS,He tried to take a throw;
4078,JUST FOLKS,"It put three fingers out of joint,"
4079,JUST FOLKS,And father let it go.
4080,JUST FOLKS,He stopped a grounder with his face;
4081,JUST FOLKS,"Was spiked, nor was that all;"
4082,JUST FOLKS,"It looked to us like suicide,"
4083,JUST FOLKS,When father played baseball.
4084,JUST FOLKS,
4085,JUST FOLKS,"At last he limped away, and now"
4086,JUST FOLKS,He suffers in disgrace;
4087,JUST FOLKS,His arms are bathed in liniment;
4088,JUST FOLKS,Court plaster hides his face.
4089,JUST FOLKS,"He says his back is breaking, and"
4090,JUST FOLKS,His legs won't move at all;
4091,JUST FOLKS,It made a wreck of father when
4092,JUST FOLKS,He tried to play baseball.
4093,JUST FOLKS,
4094,JUST FOLKS,The smell of arnica abounds;
4095,JUST FOLKS,He hobbles with a cane;
4096,JUST FOLKS,A row of blisters mar his hands;
4097,JUST FOLKS,He is in constant pain.
4098,JUST FOLKS,"But lame and weak as father is,"
4099,JUST FOLKS,He swears he'll lick us all
4100,JUST FOLKS,If we dare even speak about
4101,JUST FOLKS,The day he played baseball.

4110,JUST FOLKS,Or never hurled a snowball swift
4111,JUST FOLKS,At someone's high silk hat.
4112,JUST FOLKS,"Who never ran away from school,"
4113,JUST FOLKS,To seek the swimming hole;
4114,JUST FOLKS,Or slyly from a neighbor's yard
4115,JUST FOLKS,Green apples never stole.
4116,JUST FOLKS,Show me the boy who never broke
4117,JUST FOLKS,A pane of window glass;
4118,JUST FOLKS,Who never disobeyed the sign
4119,JUST FOLKS,"That says: ""Keep off the grass."""
4120,JUST FOLKS,"Who never did a thousand things,"

4154,JUST FOLKS,as it often has tinkled before.
4155,JUST FOLKS,"I turned in my chair in a half-grouchy way,"
4156,JUST FOLKS,for a telephone call is a bore;
4157,JUST FOLKS,"And I thought, ""It is somebody wanting to know"

4159,JUST FOLKS,"In a tone that was gruff I shouted ""Hello,"""
4160,JUST FOLKS,a sign for the talk to begin.
4161,JUST FOLKS,"""What is it?"" I asked in a terrible way."
4162,JUST FOLKS,"I was huffy, to tell you the truth,"

4164,JUST FOLKS,"""The baby, my dear, has a tooth!"""
4165,JUST FOLKS,
4166,JUST FOLKS,I have seen a man jump when the horse that he
4167,JUST FOLKS,backed finished first in a well-driven race.
4168,JUST FOLKS,"I have heard the man cheer, as a matter of fact,"
4169,JUST FOLKS,and I've seen the blood rush to his face;
4170,JUST FOLKS,I've been on the spot when good news has come

4184,JUST FOLKS,"that, a joke, or an errand to run;"
4185,JUST FOLKS,"I've been called to the phone for the idlest of chat,"
4186,JUST FOLKS,when there was much work to be done;

4274,JUST FOLKS,The March of Mortality
4275,JUST FOLKS,
4276,JUST FOLKS,Over the hills of time to the valley of endless years;
4277,JUST FOLKS,Over the roads of woe to the land that is free from tears
4278,JUST FOLKS,"Up from the haunts of men to the place where the angels are,"
4279,JUST FOLKS,This is the march of mortality to a wonderful goal afar.
4280,JUST FOLKS,
4281,JUST FOLKS,"Troopers we are in life, warring at times with wrong,"
4282,JUST FOLKS,But promised ever unbroken rest at last in a land of song;
4283,JUST FOLKS,"And whether we serve or rule, and whether we fall or rise,"
4284,JUST FOLKS,"We shall come, in time, to that golden vale where never the spirit dies."
4285,JUST FOLKS,
4286,JUST FOLKS,"Back of the strife for gain, and under the toil for fame,"
4287,JUST FOLKS,The dreams of men in this mortal march have ever remained the same.
4288,JUST FOLKS,"They have lived through their days and years for the great rewards to be,"
4289,JUST FOLKS,When earth's dusty garb shall be laid aside for the robes of eternity.
4290,JUST FOLKS,
4291,JUST FOLKS,"This is the march of mortality, whatever man's race or creed,"
4292,JUST FOLKS,"And whether he's one of the savage tribe or one of a higher breed,"
4293,JUST FOLKS,"He is conscious dimly of better things that were promised him long ago,"
4294,JUST FOLKS,And he keeps his place in the line with men for
4295,JUST FOLKS,the joys that his soul shall know.

4300,JUST FOLKS,Growing Down
4301,JUST FOLKS,
4302,JUST FOLKS,"Time was I thought of growing up,"
4303,JUST FOLKS,But that was ere the babies came;
4304,JUST FOLKS,I'd dream and plan to be a man
4305,JUST FOLKS,"And win my share of wealth and fame,"
4306,JUST FOLKS,For age held all the splendors then
4307,JUST FOLKS,And wisdom seemed lifes brightest crown
4308,JUST FOLKS,For mortal brow. It's different now.
4309,JUST FOLKS,Each evening finds me growing down.
4310,JUST FOLKS,
4311,JUST FOLKS,I'm not so keen for growing up
4312,JUST FOLKS,"To wrinkled cheek and heavy tongue,"
4313,JUST FOLKS,And sluggish blood; with little Bud
4314,JUST FOLKS,I long to be a comrade young.
4315,JUST FOLKS,"His sports are joys I want to share,"
4316,JUST FOLKS,"His games are games I want to play,"
4317,JUST FOLKS,An old man grim's no chum for him
4318,JUST FOLKS,And so I'm growing down to-day.
4319,JUST FOLKS,
4320,JUST FOLKS,"I'm back to marbles and to tops,"
4321,JUST FOLKS,To flying kites and one-ol'-cat;
4322,JUST FOLKS,"""Fan acres!"" I now loudly cry;"
4323,JUST FOLKS,I also take my turn at bat;
4324,JUST FOLKS,I've had my fling at growing up
4325,JUST FOLKS,And want no old man's fair renown.
4326,JUST FOLKS,"To be a boy is finer joy,"
4327,JUST FOLKS,And so I've started growing down.
4328,JUST FOLKS,
4329,JUST FOLKS,Once more I'm learning games I knew
4330,JUST FOLKS,"When I was four and five and six,"
4331,JUST FOLKS,I'm going back along life's track
4332,JUST FOLKS,"To find the same old-fashioned tricks,"
4333,JUST FOLKS,And happy are the hours we spend
4334,JUST FOLKS,"Together, without sigh or frown."
4335,JUST FOLKS,"To be a boy is Age's joy,"
4336,JUST FOLKS,And so to him I'm growing down.

4341,JUST FOLKS,The Roads of Happiness
4342,JUST FOLKS,
4343,JUST FOLKS,The roads of happiness are not
4344,JUST FOLKS,"The selfish roads of pleasure seeking,"
4345,JUST FOLKS,Where cheeks are flushed with haste and hot
4346,JUST FOLKS,And none has time for kindly speaking.
4347,JUST FOLKS,"But they're the roads where lovers stray,"
4348,JUST FOLKS,Where wives and husbands walk together
4349,JUST FOLKS,And children romp along the way
4350,JUST FOLKS,Whenever it is pleasant weather.
4351,JUST FOLKS,
4352,JUST FOLKS,The roads of happiness are trod
4353,JUST FOLKS,"By simple folks and tender-hearted,"
4354,JUST FOLKS,By gentle folks that worship God
4355,JUST FOLKS,And want to live their days unparted.
4356,JUST FOLKS,"There kindly people stop and talk,"
4357,JUST FOLKS,"Regardless of the chase for money,"
4358,JUST FOLKS,"There, arm in arm, the grown-ups walk"
4359,JUST FOLKS,And every eye you see is sunny.
4360,JUST FOLKS,
4361,JUST FOLKS,"The roads of happiness are lined,"
4362,JUST FOLKS,"Not with the friends of royal splendor,"
4363,JUST FOLKS,But with the loyal friends and kind
4364,JUST FOLKS,That do the gentle deeds and tender.
4365,JUST FOLKS,There fame has never brought unrest
4366,JUST FOLKS,Nor glory set men's hearts to aching;
4367,JUST FOLKS,There unabandoned is life's best
4368,JUST FOLKS,For selfish love and money making.
4369,JUST FOLKS,
4370,JUST FOLKS,The roads of happiness are those
4371,JUST FOLKS,That do not lead to pomp and glory
4372,JUST FOLKS,But wind among the joys and woes
4373,JUST FOLKS,That make the humble toiler's story.
4374,JUST FOLKS,The roads that oft we used to tread
4375,JUST FOLKS,"In early days when first we mated,"
4376,JUST FOLKS,"When hearts were light and cheeks were red,"
4377,JUST FOLKS,And days were not with burdens freighted.

4382,JUST FOLKS,June
4383,JUST FOLKS,
4384,JUST FOLKS,"June is here, the month of roses, month of brides and month of bees,"
4385,JUST FOLKS,"Weaving garlands for our lassies, whispering love songs in the trees,"
4386,JUST FOLKS,"Painting scenes of gorgeous splendor, canvases no man could brush,"
4387,JUST FOLKS,Changing scenes from early morning till the sunset's crimson flush.
4388,JUST FOLKS,
4389,JUST FOLKS,"June is here, the month of blossoms, month of roses white and red,"
4390,JUST FOLKS,"Wet with dew and perfume-laden, nodding wheresoe'er we tread;"
4391,JUST FOLKS,"Come the bees to gather honey, all the lazy afternoon;"
4392,JUST FOLKS,"Flowers and lassies, men and meadows, love alike the month of June."
4393,JUST FOLKS,
4394,JUST FOLKS,"Month of love and month of sunshine, month of happiness and song,"
4395,JUST FOLKS,Month that cheers the sad wayfarer as he plods the road along;
4396,JUST FOLKS,"Spreading out a velvet carpet, green and yellow, for his feet,"
4397,JUST FOLKS,And affording for his rest hours many a cool and sweet retreat.

4402,JUST FOLKS,When Mother Sleeps
4403,JUST FOLKS,
4404,JUST FOLKS,"When mother sleeps, a slamming door"
4405,JUST FOLKS,Disturbs her not at all;
4406,JUST FOLKS,A man might walk across the floor
4407,JUST FOLKS,Or wander through the hall
4408,JUST FOLKS,A pistol shot outside would not
4409,JUST FOLKS,Drive slumber from her eyes--
4410,JUST FOLKS,But she is always on the spot
4411,JUST FOLKS,The moment baby cries.
4412,JUST FOLKS,
4413,JUST FOLKS,"The thunder crash she would not hear,"
4414,JUST FOLKS,Nor shouting in the street;
4415,JUST FOLKS,"A barking dog, however near,"
4416,JUST FOLKS,Of sleep can never cheat
4417,JUST FOLKS,"Dear mother, but I've noticed this"
4418,JUST FOLKS,To my profound surprise:
4419,JUST FOLKS,That always wide-awake she is
4420,JUST FOLKS,The moment baby cries.
4421,JUST FOLKS,
4422,JUST FOLKS,"However weary she may be,"
4423,JUST FOLKS,"Though wrapped in slumber deep,"
4424,JUST FOLKS,Somehow it always seems to me
4425,JUST FOLKS,Her vigil she will keep.
4426,JUST FOLKS,"Sound sleeper that she is, I take"
4427,JUST FOLKS,It in her heart there lies
4428,JUST FOLKS,A love that causes her to wake
4429,JUST FOLKS,The moment baby cries.

4434,JUST FOLKS,The Weaver
4435,JUST FOLKS,
4436,JUST FOLKS,"The patter of rain on the roof,"
4437,JUST FOLKS,The glint of the sun on the rose;
4438,JUST FOLKS,"Of life, these the warp and the woof,"
4439,JUST FOLKS,The weaving that everyone knows.
4440,JUST FOLKS,"Now grief with its consequent tear,"
4441,JUST FOLKS,Now joy with its luminous smile;
4442,JUST FOLKS,The days are the threads of the year--
4443,JUST FOLKS,Is what I am weaving worth while?
4444,JUST FOLKS,
4445,JUST FOLKS,What pattern have I on my loom?
4446,JUST FOLKS,Shall my bit of tapestry please?
4447,JUST FOLKS,Am I working with gray threads of gloom?
4448,JUST FOLKS,Is there faith in the figures I seize?
4449,JUST FOLKS,"When my fingers are lifeless and cold,"
4450,JUST FOLKS,And the threads I no longer can weave
4451,JUST FOLKS,Shall there be there for men to behold
4452,JUST FOLKS,One sign of the things I believe?
4453,JUST FOLKS,
4454,JUST FOLKS,"God sends me the gray days and rare,"
4455,JUST FOLKS,"The threads from his bountiful skein,"
4456,JUST FOLKS,"And many, as sunshine, are fair."
4457,JUST FOLKS,And some are as dark as the rain.
4458,JUST FOLKS,And I think as I toil to express
4459,JUST FOLKS,"My life through the days slipping by,"
4460,JUST FOLKS,Shall my tapestry prove a success?
4461,JUST FOLKS,What sort of a weaver am I?
4462,JUST FOLKS,
4463,JUST FOLKS,Am I making the most of the red
4464,JUST FOLKS,And the bright strands of luminous gold?
4465,JUST FOLKS,Or blotting them out with the thread
4466,JUST FOLKS,By which all men's failure is told?
4467,JUST FOLKS,"Am I picturing life as despair,"
4468,JUST FOLKS,"As a thing men shall shudder to see,"
4469,JUST FOLKS,Or weaving a bit that is fair
4470,JUST FOLKS,That shall stand as the record of me?
4471,JUST FOLKS,

4475,JUST FOLKS,The Few
4476,JUST FOLKS,
4477,JUST FOLKS,The easy roads are crowded
4478,JUST FOLKS,And the level roads are jammed;
4479,JUST FOLKS,The pleasant little rivers
4480,JUST FOLKS,With the drifting folks are crammed.
4481,JUST FOLKS,"But off yonder where it's rocky,"
4482,JUST FOLKS,"Where you get a better view,"
4483,JUST FOLKS,You will find the ranks are thinning
4484,JUST FOLKS,And the travelers are few.
4485,JUST FOLKS,
4486,JUST FOLKS,Where the going's smooth and pleasant
4487,JUST FOLKS,"You will always find the throng,"
4488,JUST FOLKS,"For the many, more's the pity,"
4489,JUST FOLKS,Seem to like to drift along.
4490,JUST FOLKS,"But the steeps that call for courage,"
4491,JUST FOLKS,And the task that's hard to do
4492,JUST FOLKS,In the end result in glory
4493,JUST FOLKS,For the never-wavering few.

4498,JUST FOLKS,Real Swimming
4499,JUST FOLKS,
4500,JUST FOLKS,"I saw him in the distance, as the train went speeding by,"
4501,JUST FOLKS,A shivery little fellow standing in the sun to dry.
4502,JUST FOLKS,And a little pile of clothing very near him I could see:
4503,JUST FOLKS,He was owner of a gladness that had once belonged to me.
4504,JUST FOLKS,"I have shivered as he shivered, I have dried the way he dried,"
4505,JUST FOLKS,I've stood naked in God's sunshine with my garments at my side;
4506,JUST FOLKS,"And I thought as I beheld him, of the many weary men"
4507,JUST FOLKS,Who would like to go in swimming as a little boy again.
4508,JUST FOLKS,
4509,JUST FOLKS,"I saw him scarce a moment, yet I knew his lips were blue"
4510,JUST FOLKS,And I knew his teeth were chattering just as mine were wont to do;
4511,JUST FOLKS,And I knew his merry playmates in the pond were splashing still;
4512,JUST FOLKS,I could tell how much he envied all the boys that never chill;
4513,JUST FOLKS,"And throughout that lonesome journey, I kept living o'er and o'er"
4514,JUST FOLKS,The joys of going swimming when no bathing suits we wore;
4515,JUST FOLKS,"I was with that little fellow, standing chattering in the sun;"
4516,JUST FOLKS,I was sharing in his shivers and a partner of his fun.
4517,JUST FOLKS,
4518,JUST FOLKS,Back to me there came the pictures that I never shall forget
4519,JUST FOLKS,"When I dared not travel homewards if my shock of hair was wet,"
4520,JUST FOLKS,When I did my brief undressing under fine and friendly trees
4521,JUST FOLKS,In the days before convention rigged us up in b.v.d's.
4522,JUST FOLKS,"And I dived for stones and metal on the mill pond's muddy floor,"
4523,JUST FOLKS,Then stood naked in the sunshine till my blood grew warm once more.
4524,JUST FOLKS,"I was back again, a youngster, in those golden days of old,"
4525,JUST FOLKS,When my teeth were wont to chatter and my lips were blue with cold.

4530,JUST FOLKS,The Love of the Game
4531,JUST FOLKS,
4532,JUST FOLKS,"There is too much of sighing, and weaving"
4533,JUST FOLKS,Of pitiful tales of despair.
4534,JUST FOLKS,"There is too much of wailing and grieving,"
4535,JUST FOLKS,And too much of railing at care.
4536,JUST FOLKS,There is far too much glorification
4537,JUST FOLKS,Of money and pleasure and fame;
4538,JUST FOLKS,"But I sing the joy of my station,"
4539,JUST FOLKS,And I sing the love of my game.
4540,JUST FOLKS,
4541,JUST FOLKS,There is too much of tremble-lip telling
4542,JUST FOLKS,Of hurts that have come with the fight.
4543,JUST FOLKS,There is too much of pitiful dwelling
4544,JUST FOLKS,On plans that have failed to go right.
4545,JUST FOLKS,There is too much of envious pining
4546,JUST FOLKS,For luxuries others may claim.
4547,JUST FOLKS,"Too much thought of wining and dining,"
4548,JUST FOLKS,But I sing the love of my game.
4549,JUST FOLKS,
4550,JUST FOLKS,There is too much of grim magnifying
4551,JUST FOLKS,"The troubles that come with the day,"
4552,JUST FOLKS,There is too much indifferent trying
4553,JUST FOLKS,To travel a care-beset way.
4554,JUST FOLKS,"Too much do men think of gold-getting,"
4555,JUST FOLKS,"Too much have they underwrit shame,"
4556,JUST FOLKS,"Which accounts for the frowning and fretting,"
4557,JUST FOLKS,But I sing the joy of my game.
4558,JUST FOLKS,
4559,JUST FOLKS,Let's get back to the work we are doing;
4560,JUST FOLKS,Let us reckon its joys and its pain;
4561,JUST FOLKS,"Let us pause while our tasks we're reviewing,"
4562,JUST FOLKS,To sum up the cost of each gain.
4563,JUST FOLKS,Let us give up our whining and wailing
4564,JUST FOLKS,"Because of the bruises that maim,"
4565,JUST FOLKS,And battle the chances of failing
4566,JUST FOLKS,As being a part of the game.
4567,JUST FOLKS,
4568,JUST FOLKS,"Let us care more for serving than winning,"
4569,JUST FOLKS,Let us look at our woes as they are;
4570,JUST FOLKS,It is time now that we were beginning
4571,JUST FOLKS,To be less afraid of a scar.
4572,JUST FOLKS,Let us cease in our glorification
4573,JUST FOLKS,"Of money and pleasure and fame,"
4574,JUST FOLKS,"And find, whatsoe'er be our station,"
4575,JUST FOLKS,Our joy in the love of the game.

4584,JUST FOLKS,"But I'm humming a song, as I wander along,"
4585,JUST FOLKS,And I smile at the roses that nod by the way.
4586,JUST FOLKS,"Red roses sweet,"
4587,JUST FOLKS,"Blooming there at my feet,"
4588,JUST FOLKS,Just dripping with honey and perfume and cheer;
4589,JUST FOLKS,What a weakling I'd be
4590,JUST FOLKS,If I tried not to see
4591,JUST FOLKS,The joy and the comfort you bring to us here.
4592,JUST FOLKS,
4593,JUST FOLKS,"Just tramping along o'er the highway of life,"
4594,JUST FOLKS,Knowing not what's ahead but still doing my best;
4595,JUST FOLKS,"And I sing as I go, for my soul seems to know"
4596,JUST FOLKS,In the end I shall come to the valley of rest.
4597,JUST FOLKS,With the sun in my face
4598,JUST FOLKS,And the roses to grace
4599,JUST FOLKS,"The roads that I travel, what have I to fear?"
4600,JUST FOLKS,What a coward I'd be
4601,JUST FOLKS,If I tried not to see
4602,JUST FOLKS,The roses of hope and the sunshine of cheer.
