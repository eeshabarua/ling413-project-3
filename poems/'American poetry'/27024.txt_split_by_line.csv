164,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"(Obiit, June 8th, 1894.)"
165,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,
166,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,
167,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,_Tho' storm and summer shine for long have shed
168,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Or blight or bloom above thy quiet bed,"
169,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Tho' loneliness and longing cry thee dead--
170,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Thou art not dead, belov√®d. Still with me"
171,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Are whilom hopings that encompass thee
172,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,And dreams of dear delights that may not be.
173,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Asleep--adream perchance, dost thou forget"
174,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"The sometime sorrow and the fevered fret,"
175,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Sting of salt tears and long unbreathed regret?
176,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Liest thou here thro' long sunshiny hours,"
177,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Holding sweet converse with the springing flowers,"
178,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Harking the singing of the warm sweet showers
179,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,That fall like happy tears ... dost hear
180,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,The birds that unafraid assail thine ear--
181,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"And yet art silent when I whisper? Dear,"
182,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Dost thou not hear?_
183,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,
184,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,_Lying so low beneath the bending grass
185,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"In long, still smiling tranced for aye--alas!"
186,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Thou dost not harken when my footsteps pass.
187,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,If haply I some tender thing should tell
188,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Thee of the springtime flowers thou once loved well--
189,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Anemone and shining asphodel;
190,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Should steal from Nature some enchanted lay,"
191,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Some bird-song lilted where green branches sway--
192,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Heart-music that could stir thy heart alway;
193,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"Should call thee by the old fond name again,"
194,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Should tell thee all a heart's enduring pain
195,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,"And long rememb'ring, would'st thou mute remain?"
196,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Alas! nor sigh nor song can thrill the ear
197,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Tuned to Israfel's music in the sphere
198,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Where things to thee erst dear no more are dear.
199,_TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER_,Thou dost not hear!_

204,THE PATH OF DREAMS,THE PATH OF DREAMS
205,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
206,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
207,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
208,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
209,THE PATH OF DREAMS,In Woodland Ways
210,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
211,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
212,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Out of the poignant glare, the shadeless heat"
213,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Of summer noon, beseech thee follow me"
214,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Into the dim, dream-haunted secrecy"
215,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"The cool, green glooms, the grottoed deep retreat,"
216,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Of yon old wood; down aisles of lichened trees--
217,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Grey Merlins clasped by lissom Viviens
218,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Of clinging vine--to cloistered sylvan glens,"
219,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Where Nature weaves her fairest mysteries.
220,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
221,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Here let us rest a little--find surcease
222,THE PATH OF DREAMS,For feet grown weary of the thridded street
223,THE PATH OF DREAMS,That echoes ever to the ceaseless beat
224,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Of human tread;--a brief while know the ease
225,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Of dreamful rest, to slumb'rous languors stilled"
226,THE PATH OF DREAMS,On Orient rugs of dappled mosses spread
227,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"In nooks where blossom, purple, white and red,"
228,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The flowers Summer's lavish hands have spilled.
229,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
230,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Wild woodland creatures near us unafraid,"
231,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Some strange enchantment doth the forest hold--
232,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Was that a sungleam, or a wand of gold"
233,THE PATH OF DREAMS,By tricksy Puck or wanton Ariel swayed?
234,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Old oaks and beeches open wide their doors
235,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And hamadryads veiled in golden sheen
236,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Floating diaphanous o'er robes of green
237,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Walk with still feet the forest's russet floors.
238,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
239,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Lo, here are fairies hid in flower-bells,"
240,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"There wood-nymphs fleeing from pursuing fauns,"
241,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And naiads fleshed with hues of rosy dawns
242,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Lie dreaming by white streams in dusky dells;
243,THE PATH OF DREAMS,We tread dim paths untrod by foot of man
244,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And hark the horn of Dian ringing clear;
245,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"While faint, elusive, thin--now far, now near,"
246,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Meseems I hear the oaten pipe of Pan.
247,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
248,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"And while o'erhead the plaining wood-dove grieves,"
249,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"The cardinal--a wing√®d, scarlet flower--"
250,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Sprays all the air with song, a golden shower"
251,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Of flutes-notes sifting downward thro' the leaves.
252,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Ah, sweet enchantment doth the forest hold,"
253,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"For Nature's self doth haunt these woodland ways,"
254,THE PATH OF DREAMS,My fevered brow on her cool breast she lays
255,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And care slips from me as a garment old.
256,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
257,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
258,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
259,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
260,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Ashes of Roses
261,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
262,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
263,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Skies glooming overhead,"
264,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Autumn winds sighing;
265,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Bare yonder garden bed,"
266,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Flowers low lying.
267,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"All their rich radiance fled,"
268,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"All their pale petals shed,"
269,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Wan wraiths of Summer sped,"
270,THE PATH OF DREAMS,In Autumn's closes;
271,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Crimson and cream and gold
272,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Strewn on earth's bosom cold,"
273,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Mingling with umber mold--
274,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Ashes of roses.
275,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
276,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"See, in yon waning West"
277,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Rich roses blowing
278,THE PATH OF DREAMS,On Heaven's palimpsest
279,THE PATH OF DREAMS,God's message glowing;
280,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Rose hues and amethyst
281,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Drenched in purpureate mist,"
282,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Darkness with Day keeps tryst,"
283,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Night's curtain closes;
284,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Quenched is the burning gold,"
285,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Shadowed the upland wold,"
286,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Day's fires grow dull and cold
287,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Ashes of roses.
288,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
289,THE PATH OF DREAMS,So on this heart of mine
290,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Shadows are lying;
291,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Lotus and rue entwine,"
292,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Dim dreams are dying;
293,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Stilled is the thrill divine,"
294,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Spilled is the amber wine,"
295,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Dimly the cold stars shine;
296,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Wan age discloses
297,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"All youth's bright blossoms dead,"
298,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"All love's rare radiance sped,"
299,THE PATH OF DREAMS,All hope's pure petals shed--
300,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Ashes of roses.
301,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
302,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
303,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
304,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
305,THE PATH OF DREAMS,A Challenge
306,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
307,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
308,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"To have lived, to have loved, to have triumphed!--what more can the"
309,THE PATH OF DREAMS,world bestow?
310,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"I stand at the close of the conflict, my foot on the neck of my foe."
311,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Prone in the dust lies the demon Despair, still shouting his shibboleth"
312,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"To the treacherous Amazon dark-browed Fate, and her grisly comrade, Death."
313,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"To have lived! To have felt in my veins the surge of the rich, red tide of"
314,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"life,"
315,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The quickening stir of the strong man's heart that thrills to the sound
316,THE PATH OF DREAMS,of strife;
317,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"To have wrested success from defeat, to have striven, and struggled,"
318,THE PATH OF DREAMS,and won--
319,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Shall this seem a small thing, think you, when the Battle of Ages is done?"
320,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"To have loved! To have known of all raptures, the rapture supernal, divine,"
321,THE PATH OF DREAMS,To have felt the throb of your heart on my heart and the bloom of your
322,THE PATH OF DREAMS,lips pressed to mine;
323,THE PATH OF DREAMS,To have ranked with the gods on Olympus--myths tell us immortal Jove
324,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Cleft with his swan-wings the blue of the sky for boon of a mortal's
325,THE PATH OF DREAMS,love....
326,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"I have lived, I have loved, I have triumphed! Let Death come, or early"
327,THE PATH OF DREAMS,or late!
328,THE PATH OF DREAMS,I hurl my challenging gauntlet full in the face of Fate!
329,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Fate may make wreck of a future--how can she alter the past?
330,THE PATH OF DREAMS,I have tasted the sweets of life's chalice--why shrink from the lees
331,THE PATH OF DREAMS,at the last?
332,THE PATH OF DREAMS,How should I cavil at aught that shall come--I stand with your head on
333,THE PATH OF DREAMS,my breast--
334,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"I have fought as I might--I have gained _you_, beloved ... to God's"
335,THE PATH OF DREAMS,mercy the rest!
336,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Tho' the heavens darken above me and the sky be shrunk as a scroll,"
337,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"In the wreck and ruin of riven worlds, should I falter, O Soul of my soul?"
338,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Tho' the demon Despair, where he vanquished lies, still utter his"
339,THE PATH OF DREAMS,shibboleth--
340,THE PATH OF DREAMS,I fling my glove in the face of Fate and smile in the eyes of Death!
341,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
342,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
343,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
344,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
345,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And Yet ...
346,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
347,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
348,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Upon the meads where we were wont to stray,"
349,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"'Guiling with springtime hopes the winter hours,"
350,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The Spring has smiled; yon slope that late gloomed gray
351,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"And sternly sad, 'neath April's tender showers"
352,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Grows green and glad again. The rippled grass,"
353,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"A soundless sea o'er which white cloud-sails pass,"
354,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Breaks at my feet in billows foamed with flowers;
355,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And blue-eyed myrtle blooms with lashes wet
356,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Smile to me thro' their tears. The skies are blue,"
357,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And life is sweet to-day and hope seems true;
358,THE PATH OF DREAMS,My heart is barren of its long regret--
359,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And yet...
360,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
361,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The willow wears a wistful green. A dream
362,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Of Summer warmth the wine-sweet breezes hold,"
363,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Fair wildings blow--bright buttercups agleam
364,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Like shining sequins scattered on the wold,"
365,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And daffodills--a wealth of faery gold.
366,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The building birds their coming bliss presage
367,THE PATH OF DREAMS,With lilt and lyric brimming o'er the page
368,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Of Nature's volume bound in green and gold.
369,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Here 'mid the birds and blossoms 'neath the blue--
370,THE PATH OF DREAMS,My heart unburthened of the old regret--
371,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Let me forget long striving to forget;
372,THE PATH OF DREAMS,For life is sweet to-day and hope seems true--
373,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And yet...
374,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
375,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
376,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
377,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
378,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The Master-Player
379,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
380,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
381,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Mute was the mighty organ. None might break
382,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The silence that had thralled it since was stilled
383,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The master-hand beneath whose touch it thrilled
384,THE PATH OF DREAMS,To music such as choiring seraphs make--
385,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Until a mightier Master came to wake
386,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Th' elusive chords and subtle harmonies
387,THE PATH OF DREAMS,That lay imprisoned in the cold white keys
388,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And once again the soul of Music spake.
389,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Methought my soul's most perfect melodies
390,THE PATH OF DREAMS,No hand again to sonance could evoke--
391,THE PATH OF DREAMS,A silent harp whose potence none might prove--
392,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"But, lo! one came who swept its chords and woke"

403,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Weft on an Orient loom,"
404,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Star-set upon the sward quaint, old-time blossoms"
405,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Wrought broidery of bloom.

410,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The sweetest flower of all!)
411,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
412,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And one rare rose she watched each year with hoping
413,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Till the dear eyes grew dim--
414,THE PATH OF DREAMS,But ere a single blossom burst in beauty
415,THE PATH OF DREAMS,God took her home to Him.

453,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
454,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
455,THE PATH OF DREAMS,I dreamt of love in the golden glory
456,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Of youth unshadowed by cloud or care;
457,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Steeped in the love-lore of song and story,"
458,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"I said, ""My Love shall be wondrous fair."""
459,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
460,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"I said, ""Her hands shall be filled with flowers,"
461,THE PATH OF DREAMS,(My heart shall tell me when Love draws nigh!)
462,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"She shall steal sweet boon from the graceless hours,"
463,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Her eyes shall be blue as the cerule sky.
464,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
465,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"""Her hair shall be bright as the stars' gold gleaming,"

468,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Each pulse of my being shall call her mine!"""
469,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
470,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Then long for the voice of my heart I harkened,"
471,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Tranced in love's hoping--all hope else forgot--
472,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"I waited lonely; the daylight darkened,"
473,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The twilight deepened--but love came not.
474,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
475,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Then One passed by in the dusking shadows,"
476,THE PATH OF DREAMS,The night's dusk shadows slept on her hair--
477,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"She passed like a gleam o'er the dew-drenched meadows,"
478,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And my heart throbbed fast--but she was not fair.
479,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
480,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"Her face was pale and her dark eyes pleading,"
481,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Her smile was wistful and gravely sweet;
482,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"She passed me by where I stood unheeding,"
483,THE PATH OF DREAMS,And dropped a violet at my feet.
484,THE PATH OF DREAMS,
485,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"She went her way o'er the silent meadows,"
486,THE PATH OF DREAMS,"(Ah, traitorous heart that you tricked me so!)"
487,THE PATH OF DREAMS,I sat alone in the deepening shadows--
488,THE PATH OF DREAMS,Love had passed by--and I did not know.

683,I.,"(And though not for me were the rapture to prove you,"
684,I.,I thrilled as I thought how a woman might love you!)
685,I.,
686,I.,Then--strange that our eyes for a moment should meet
687,I.,"And hold each other a breathless space,"
688,I.,"That a light as of dawn should leap into your face,"
689,I.,That the lips that were stern should an instant grow sweet--
690,I.,"Ere you turned, at a word, with a courtier's grace."
691,I.,"(And I knew that tho' many a woman had loved you,"
692,I.,"Till that moment, the glance of no woman had moved you!)"
693,I.,

713,II.,Is it like that he with his princely pride--
714,II.,"The son of a proud old race,"

800,VI.,My whilom doubts and fears.
801,VI.,
802,VI.,"Each little common thing to me seems rarer,"
803,VI.,My life each day becomes more dear to me;

828,VII.,The swift onflowing tide
829,VII.,Of a mighty seaward stream!
830,VII.,
831,VII.,"I know that the fault was mine,"
832,VII.,"But I cannot, will not speak;"
833,VII.,"How should I, suppliant, meek,"
834,VII.,His gracious pardon seek--
835,VII.,Tho' the fault were mine--all mine?
836,VII.,
837,VII.,"Aye, tho' my heart should break,"

850,VIII.,With that kingly courtesy
851,VIII.,Which makes his least deed fine.
852,VIII.,
853,VIII.,What fiend took hold on me?
854,VIII.,"I would nor speak nor heed,"
855,VIII.,Tho' he bent his pride to plead--
856,VIII.,"(He, all unused to sue!)"
857,VIII.,Though he sought full tenderly
858,VIII.,For a pardon not _his_ due.
859,VIII.,
860,VIII.,Fool! to have played with fire--
861,VIII.,Had I not full often heard
862,VIII.,How when his wrath was stirred
863,VIII.,It burst all bounds and leapt
864,VIII.,Higher and ever higher
865,VIII.,Like flames by the storm-wind swept?
866,VIII.,
867,VIII.,Yet--tho' his face was white
868,VIII.,With a passion that shook his soul--
869,VIII.,"Not once did he waive control,"
870,VIII.,Tho' his heart to its depths was stirred--
871,VIII.,He leashed his wrath that night
872,VIII.,Nor uttered one bitter word.

874,VIII.,"Pride held me stubbornly dumb,"
875,VIII.,"Stilling what words I would say,"

921,X.,Knowing our prayers and tears alike are vain--
922,X.,Like to a wanton boy who feels no thrill
923,X.,"Of pity for the weak his strength holds thrall,"
924,X.,"Who pins a helpless butterfly against a wall,"
925,X.,Watching the bright wings flutter and grow still.

962,XII.,(An eagle matched with a pitiful wren!)
963,XII.,Bitter in sooth has his portion been--
964,XII.,Chained to a clog for life!

968,XII.,"That the lips that were stern should an instant grow sweet,"
969,XII.,Touched with the old-time tender grace.
970,XII.,But his eyes were haggard and old with pain
971,XII.,(Traitors to thwart his resolute will!)
972,XII.,They told me the struggle was vain--all vain!
973,XII.,He loves me--loves me still.
974,XII.,

976,XIII.,XIII.
977,XIII.,

1008,XIV.,
1009,XIV.,"Yet not all blameless he,"

1043,XV.,At a bitter cost she has set him free--
1044,XV.,Free! with a blemished fame.
1045,XV.,
1046,XV.,"And he with the pride of his race,"
1047,XV.,"With a resolute, calm control,"
1048,XV.,"Locks in his heart the heart's disgrace,"

1050,XV.,Hiding the hurt of a stricken soul
1051,XV.,'Neath the calm of a passionless face.
1052,XV.,
1053,XV.,He had deemed it a cowardly thing to fly

1069,XVI.,"Last night as I stood in the gloaming's gray,"

1072,XVI.,At last he is going away.
1073,XVI.,
1074,XVI.,"His face in the dusk showed stern and set,"
1075,XVI.,Old and haggard and worn with pain;
1076,XVI.,"""Dear, I may never see you again--"

1086,XVI.,
1087,XVI.,"And then, ere he lifted his bridle rein"
1088,XVI.,"To ride away down the dark'ning land,"
1089,XVI.,He bent and touched with his lips the hand

1101,XVII.,"How it had chanced, he could only tell,"
1102,XVII.,Ere the merciful numbness stole his brain;
1103,XVII.,How the chestnut rose to the leap and fell....
1104,XVII.,Then his senses closed on the shocks of pain.
1105,XVII.,"He spoke, they told me, but once again--"
1106,XVII.,To whisper my name with his struggling breath--
1107,XVII.,"(Thank God, he suffered so brief a while)"
1108,XVII.,"Then peacefully sank on the breast of Death,"
1109,XVII.,"Dead, with his lips asmile."
1110,XVII.,
1111,XVII.,"How can I wish him alive again,"
1112,XVII.,"Lying so peacefully, placidly still,"
1113,XVII.,With that carven smile on his marble face.
1114,XVII.,How can I pray that his heart should thrill
1115,XVII.,To waking and waking's pain?
1116,XVII.,"Lying so peacefully, placidly still."
1117,XVII.,"With the old, sweet smile on his quiet face,"
1118,XVII.,Dead to the sting of a heart's disgrace....
1119,XVII.,"How should I wish him a lesser grace,"
1120,XVII.,How should I strive with a wiser Will?
1121,XVII.,Yet how can the heart that is reft divine
1122,XVII.,"Death's mystical, measureless charity?"
1123,XVII.,The cry of the stricken king is mine:
1124,XVII.,"""Would I had died for thee!"""

1151,XVII.,
1152,XVII.,Felt rise within him bestial strange desires
1153,XVII.,And savage instincts in a brutal heart
1154,XVII.,That battened on men's blood; burned with unhallowed fires
1155,XVII.,"Of slaughter--till--a thing apart,"

1162,XVII.,"While loud acclaims the listening heavens fill,"
1163,XVII.,And Roman women smile. He does not know; or feel
1164,XVII.,A moment's joy or one triumphant thrill.
1165,XVII.,He heeds them not. He sees as in a dream
1166,XVII.,His home and Cyrasella's citron groves;
1167,XVII.,"A youth again, beside some purling stream,"
1168,XVII.,With gladsome heart and joyous pipe he roves.
