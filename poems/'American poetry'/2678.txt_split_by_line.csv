27,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
28,PREFACE.,
29,PREFACE.,THE verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson
30,PREFACE.,"long since called ""the Poetry of the Portfolio,""--something produced"
31,PREFACE.,"absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of"
32,PREFACE.,expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably
33,PREFACE.,forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism
34,PREFACE.,"and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it"
35,PREFACE.,may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the
36,PREFACE.,unconventional utterance of daring thoughts. In the case of the
37,PREFACE.,"present author, there was absolutely no choice in the matter; she"
38,PREFACE.,"must write thus, or not at all. A recluse by temperament and habit,"
39,PREFACE.,literally spending years without setting her foot beyond the
40,PREFACE.,"doorstep, and many more years during which her walks were strictly"
41,PREFACE.,"limited to her father's grounds, she habitually concealed her mind,"
42,PREFACE.,"like her person, from all but a very few friends; and it was with"
43,PREFACE.,"great difficulty that she was persuaded to print, during her"
44,PREFACE.,"lifetime, three or four poems.  Yet she wrote verses in great"
45,PREFACE.,abundance; and though brought curiously indifferent to all
46,PREFACE.,"conventional rules, had yet a rigorous literary standard of her own,"
47,PREFACE.,and often altered a word many times to suit an ear which had its own
48,PREFACE.,tenacious fastidiousness.
49,PREFACE.,
50,PREFACE.,"Miss Dickinson was born in Amherst, Mass., Dec. 10, 1830, and died"
51,PREFACE.,"there May 15, 1886. Her father, Hon. Edward Dickinson, was the"
52,PREFACE.,"leading lawyer of Amherst, and was treasurer of the well-known"
53,PREFACE.,college there situated. It was his custom once a year to hold a large
54,PREFACE.,"reception at his house, attended by all the families connected with"
55,PREFACE.,the institution and by the leading people of the town. On these
56,PREFACE.,occasions his daughter Emily emerged from her wonted retirement and
57,PREFACE.,did her part as gracious hostess; nor would any one have known from
58,PREFACE.,"her manner, I have been told, that this was not a daily occurrence."
59,PREFACE.,"The annual occasion once past, she withdrew again into her seclusion,"
60,PREFACE.,and except for a very few friends was as invisible to the world as if
61,PREFACE.,"she had dwelt in a nunnery.  For myself, although I had corresponded"
62,PREFACE.,"with her for many years, I saw her but twice face to face, and"
63,PREFACE.,brought away the impression of something as unique and remote as
64,PREFACE.,Undine or Mignon or Thekla.
65,PREFACE.,
66,PREFACE.,This selection from her poems is published to meet the desire of her
67,PREFACE.,"personal friends, and especially of her surviving sister. It is"
68,PREFACE.,believed that the thoughtful reader will find in these pages a
69,PREFACE.,quality more suggestive of the poetry of William Blake than of
70,PREFACE.,"anything to be elsewhere found,--flashes of wholly original and"
71,PREFACE.,profound insight into nature and life; words and phrases exhibiting
72,PREFACE.,"an extraordinary vividness of descriptive and imaginative power, yet"
73,PREFACE.,often set in a seemingly whimsical or even rugged frame. They are
74,PREFACE.,"here published as they were written, with very few and superficial"
75,PREFACE.,changes; although it is fair to say that the titles have been
76,PREFACE.,"assigned, almost invariably, by the editors. In many cases these"
77,PREFACE.,"verses will seem to the reader like poetry torn up by the roots, with"
78,PREFACE.,"rain and dew and earth still clinging to them, giving a freshness and"
79,PREFACE.,"a fragrance not otherwise to be conveyed.  In other cases, as in the"
80,PREFACE.,"few poems of shipwreck or of mental conflict, we can only wonder at"
81,PREFACE.,the gift of vivid imagination by which this recluse woman can
82,PREFACE.,"delineate, by a few touches, the very crises of physical or mental"
83,PREFACE.,"struggle. And sometimes again we catch glimpses of a lyric strain,"
84,PREFACE.,"sustained perhaps but for a line or two at a time, and making the"
85,PREFACE.,reader regret its sudden cessation. But the main quality of these
86,PREFACE.,"poems is that of extraordinary grasp and insight, uttered with an"
87,PREFACE.,"uneven vigor sometimes exasperating, seemingly wayward, but really"
88,PREFACE.,"unsought and inevitable.  After all, when a thought takes one's"
89,PREFACE.,"breath away, a lesson on grammar seems an impertinence. As Ruskin"
90,PREFACE.,"wrote in his earlier and better days, ""No weight nor mass nor beauty"
91,PREFACE.,"of execution can outweigh one grain or fragment of thought."""

102,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
103,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"As is well documented, Emily Dickinson's poems were edited in these"
104,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"early editions by her friends, better to fit the conventions of the"
105,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"times. In particular, her dashes, often small enough to appear"
106,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"as dots, became commas and semi-colons."
107,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
108,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"In the second series of poems published, a facsimile of her"
109,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"handwritten poem which her editors titled ""Renunciation"" is given,"
110,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"and I here transcribe that manuscript as faithfully as I can,"
111,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,showing _underlined_ words thus.
112,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
113,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
114,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,There came a day - at Summer's full -
115,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Entirely for me -
116,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,I thought that such were for the Saints -
117,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Where Resurrections - be -
118,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
119,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The sun - as common - went abroad -
120,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"The flowers - accustomed - blew,"
121,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,As if no soul - that solstice passed -
122,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Which maketh all things - new -
123,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
124,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The time was scarce profaned - by speech -
125,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The falling of a word
126,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Was needless - as at Sacrament -
127,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The _Wardrobe_ - of our Lord!
128,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
129,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Each was to each - the sealed church -
130,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Permitted to commune -  _this_ time -
131,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Lest we too awkward show
132,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"At Supper of ""the Lamb."""
133,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
134,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,The hours slid fast - as hours will -
135,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Clutched tight - by greedy hands -
136,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,So - faces on two Decks look back -
137,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Bound to _opposing_ lands.
138,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
139,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"And so, when all the time had leaked,"
140,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"Without external sound,"
141,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Each bound the other's Crucifix -
142,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,We gave no other bond -
143,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
144,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"Sufficient troth - that we shall _rise_,"
145,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,Deposed - at length the Grave -
146,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,To that new marriage -
147,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,_Justified_ - through Calvaries - of Love!
148,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
149,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
150,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"From the handwriting, it is not always clear which are dashes,"
151,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"which are commas and which are periods, nor it is entirely"
152,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,clear which initial letters are capitalized.
153,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,
154,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,"However, this transcription may be compared with the edited"
155,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,version in the main text to get a flavor of the changes made
156,TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE,in these early editions.
