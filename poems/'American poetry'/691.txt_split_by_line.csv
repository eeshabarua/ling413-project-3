160,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
161,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
162,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"On Sunday morning, October seventh, 1849, Reuben A. Riley and his"
163,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"wife, Elizabeth Marine Riley, rejoiced over the birth of their"
164,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,second son.  They called him James Whitcomb.  This was in a shady
165,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"little street in the shady little town of Greenfield, which is in"
166,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,the county of Hancock and the state of Indiana.  The young James
167,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,found a brother and a sister waiting to greet him--John Andrew
168,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"and Martha Celestia, and afterward came Elva May--Mrs. Henry"
169,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Eitel-- Alexander Humbolt and Mary Elizabeth, who, of all, alone"
170,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,lives to see this collection of her brother's poems.
171,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
172,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"James Whitcomb was a slender lad, with corn-silk hair and wide"
173,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"blue eyes.  He was shy and timid, not strong physically, dreading"
174,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the cold of winter, and avoiding the rougher sports of his"
175,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"playmates.  And yet he was full of the spirit of youth, a spirit"
176,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,that manifested itself in the performance of many ingenious
177,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,pranks.  His every-day life was that of the average boy in the
178,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"average country town of that day, but his home influences were"
179,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"exceptional.  His father, who became a captain of cavalry in the"
180,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Civil War, was a lawyer of ability and an orator of more than"
181,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,local distinction.  His mother was a woman of rare strength of
182,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,character combined with deep sympathy and a clear understanding.
183,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Together, they made home a place to remember with thankful heart."
184,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
185,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"When James was twenty years old, the death of his mother made a"
186,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"profound impression on him, an impression that has influenced"
187,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,much of his verse and has remained with him always.
188,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
189,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"At an early age he was sent to school and, ""then sent back"
190,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"again,"" to use his own words.  He was restive under what he"
191,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"called the ""iron discipline.""  A number of years ago, he spoke"
192,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,of these early educational beginnings in phrases so picturesque
193,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and so characteristic that they are quoted in full:
194,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
195,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""My first teacher was a little old woman, rosy and roly-poly, who"
196,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,looked as though she might have just come tumbling out of a fairy
197,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"story, so lovable was she and so jolly and so amiable.  She kept"
198,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"school in her little Dame-Trot kind of dwelling of three rooms,"
199,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"with a porch in the rear, like a bracket on the wall, which was"
200,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"part of the play-ground of her 'scholars,'--for in those days"
201,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,pupils were called 'scholars' by their affectionate teachers.
202,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Among the twelve or fifteen boys and girls who were there I
203,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"remember particularly a little lame boy, who always got the first"
204,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,ride in the locust-tree swing during recess.
205,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
206,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""This first teacher of mine was a mother to all her 'scholars,'"
207,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"and in every way looked after their comfort, especially when"
208,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"certain little ones grew drowsy.  I was often, with others,"
209,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,carried to the sitting-room and left to slumber on a small made-
210,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,down pallet on the floor.  She would sometimes take three or four
211,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"of us together; and I recall how a playmate and I, having been"
212,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"admonished into silence, grew deeply interested in watching a"
213,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,spare old man who sat at a window with its shade drawn down.
214,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,After a while we became accustomed to this odd sight and would
215,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"laugh, and talk in whispers and give imitations, as we sat in a"
216,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"low sewing-chair, of the little old pendulating blind man at the"
217,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"window.  Well, the old man was the gentle teacher's charge, and"
218,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"for this reason, possibly, her life had become an heroic one,"
219,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"caring for her helpless husband who, quietly content, waited"
220,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,always at the window for his sight to come back to him.  And
221,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"doubtless it is to-day, as he sits at another casement and sees"
222,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"not only his earthly friends, but all the friends of the Eternal"
223,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Home, with the smiling, loyal, loving little woman forever at his"
224,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,side.
225,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
226,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""She was the kindliest of souls even when constrained to punish"
227,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,us.  After a whipping she invariably took me into the little
228,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,kitchen and gave me two great white slabs of bread cemented
229,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,together with layers of butter and jam.  As she always whipped me
230,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"with the same slender switch she used for a pointer, and cried"
231,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"over every lick, you will have an idea how much punishment I"
232,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,could stand.  When I was old enough to be lifted by the ears out
233,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,of my seat that office was performed by a pedagogue whom I
234,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"promised to 'whip sure, if he'd just wait till I got big enough.'"
235,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,He is still waiting!
236,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
237,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""There was but one book at school in which I found the slightest"
238,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,interest:  McGuffey's old leather-bound Sixth Reader.  It was the
239,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"tallest book known, and to the boys of my size it was a matter of"
240,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,eternal wonder how I could belong to 'the big class in that
241,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"reader.'  When we were to read the death of 'Little Nell,' I"
242,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"would run away, for I knew it would make me cry, that the other"
243,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"boys would laugh at me, and the whole thing would become"
244,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"ridiculous.  I couldn't bear that.  A later teacher, Captain Lee"
245,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"O. Harris, came to understand me with thorough sympathy, took"
246,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,compassion on my weaknesses and encouraged me to read the best
247,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,literature.  He understood that he couldn't get numbers into my
248,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,head.  You couldn't tamp them in!  History I also disliked as a
249,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"dry thing without juice, and dates melted out of my memory as"
250,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,speedily as tin-foil on a red-hot stove.  But I always was ready
251,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,to declaim and took natively to anything dramatic or theatrical.
252,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Captain Harris encouraged me in recitation and reading and had
253,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,ever the sweet spirit of a companion rather than the manner of an
254,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"instructor."""
255,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
256,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"But if there was ""only one book at school in which he found the"
257,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"slightest interest,"" he had before that time displayed an"
258,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,affection for a book--simply as such and not for any printed word
259,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"it might contain.  And this, after all, is the true book-lover's"
260,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,love.  Speaking of this incident--and he liked to refer to it
261,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"as his ""first literary recollection,"" he said:  ""Long"
262,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,before I was old enough to read I remember buying a book at an
263,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,old auctioneer's shop in Greenfield.  I can not imagine what
264,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,prophetic impulse took possession of me and made me forego the
265,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,ginger cakes and the candy that usually took every cent of my
266,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,youthful income.  The slender little volume must have cost all of
267,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"twenty-five cents!  It was Francis Quarles' Divine Emblems,--a"
268,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,neat little affair about the size of a pocket Testament.  I
269,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"carried it around with me all day long, delighted with the very"
270,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,feel of it.
271,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
272,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,""" 'What have you got there, Bub?' some one would ask.  'A book,'"
273,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,I would reply.  'What kind of a book?'  'Poetry-book.'  'Poetry!'
274,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"would be the amused exclamation.  'Can you read poetry?' and,"
275,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"embarrassed, I'd shake my head and make my escape, but I held on"
276,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"to the beloved little volume."""
277,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
278,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Every boy has an early determination--a first one--to follow some
279,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"ennobling profession, once he has come to man's estate, such as"
280,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"being a policeman, or a performer on the high trapeze.  The poet"
281,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"would not have been the ""Peoples' Laureate,"" had his fairy god-"
282,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"mother granted his boy-wish, but the Greenfield baker.  For to"
283,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"his childish mind it ""seemed the acme of delight,"" using again"
284,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"his own happy expression, ""to manufacture those snowy loaves of"
285,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"bread, those delicious tarts, those toothsome bon-bons.  And then"
286,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"to own them all, to keep them in store, to watch over and"
287,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,guardedly exhibit.  The thought of getting money for them was
288,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"to me a sacrilege.  Sell them?  No indeed.  Eat 'em--eat 'em, by"
289,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,tray loads and dray loads!  It was a great wonder to me why the
290,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,pale-faced baker in our town did not eat all his good things.
291,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,This I determined to do when I became owner of such a grand
292,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"establishment.  Yes, sir.  I would have a glorious feast.  Maybe"
293,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,I'd have Tom and Harry and perhaps little Kate and Florry in to
294,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,help us once in a while.  The thought of these play-mates as
295,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"'grown-up folks' didn't appeal to me.  I was but a child, with"
296,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"wide-open eyes, a healthy appetite and a wondering mind.  That"
297,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"was all.  But I have the same sweet tooth to-day, and every time"
298,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"I pass a confectioner's shop, I think of the big baker of our"
299,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"town, and Tom and Harry and the youngsters all."""
300,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
301,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"As a child, he often went with his father to the court-house"
302,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"where the lawyers and clerks playfully called him ""judge Wick."""
303,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Here as a privileged character he met and mingled with the
304,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"country folk who came to sue and be sued, and thus early the"
305,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"dialect, the native speech, the quaint expressions of his ""own"
306,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"people"" were made familiar to him, and took firm root in the"
307,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"fresh soil of his young memory.  At about this time, he made his"
308,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,first poetic attempt in a valentine which he gave to his mother.
309,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Not only did he write the verse, but he drew a sketch to"
310,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"accompany it, greatly to his mother's delight, who, according to"
311,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the best authority, gave the young poet ""three big cookies and"
312,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,didn't spank me for two weeks.  This was my earliest literary
313,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"encouragement."""
314,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
315,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Shortly after his sixteenth birthday, young Riley turned his back"
316,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,on the little schoolhouse and for a time wandered through the
317,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"different fields of art, indulging a slender talent for painting"
318,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"until he thought he was destined for the brush and palette, and"
319,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"then making merry with various musical instruments, the banjo,"
320,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the guitar, the violin, until finally he appeared as bass drummer"
321,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"in a brass band.  ""In a few weeks,"" he said, ""I had beat myself"
322,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,into the more enviable position of snare drummer.  Then I wanted
323,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"to travel with a circus, and dangle my legs before admiring"
324,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,thousands over the back seat of a Golden Chariot.  In a dearth of
325,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"comic songs for the banjo and guitar, I had written two or three"
326,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"myself, and the idea took possession of me that I might be a"
327,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"clown, introduced as a character-song-man and the composer of my"
328,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,own ballads.
329,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
330,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""My father was thinking of something else, however, and one day I"
331,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,found myself with a 'five-ought' paint brush under the eaves of
332,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"an old frame house that drank paint by the bucketful, learning to"
333,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"be a painter.  Finally, I graduated as a house, sign and"
334,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"ornamental painter, and for two summers traveled about with a"
335,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"small company of young fellows calling ourselves 'The Graphics,'"
336,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,who covered all the barns and fences in the state with
337,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"advertisements."""
338,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
339,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"At another time his, young man's fancy saw attractive"
340,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"possibilities in the village print-shop, and later his"
341,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"ambition was diverted to acting, encouraged by the good times he"
342,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,had in the theatricals of the Adelphian Society of Greenfield.

344,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"number of things fairly well--sang, played the guitar and violin,"
345,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"acted, painted signs and wrote poetry.  My father did not"

347,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"being a visionary himself, he believed he understood the dangers"
348,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,of following the promptings of the poetic temperament.  I doubted
349,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,if anything would come of the verse-writing myself.  At this time
350,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"it is easy to picture my father, a lawyer of ability, regarding"
351,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"me, nonplused, as the worst case he had ever had.  He wanted me"
352,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"to do something practical, besides being ambitious for me to"
353,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"follow in his footsteps, and at last persuaded me to settle down"
354,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and read law in his office.  This I really tried to do
355,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"conscientiously, but finding that political economy and"
356,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Blackstone did not rhyme and that the study of law was
357,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"unbearable, I slipped out of the office one summer afternoon,"

364,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,how could I travel without money?  The medicine man needed an
365,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,assistant and I plucked up courage to ask if I could join the

371,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"whole company was made up of good straight boys, jolly chirping"
372,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,vagabonds like myself.  It was delightful to bowl over the

398,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"department for all he produced, so he began, timidly, to offer"
399,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,his poetic wares in foreign markets.  The editor of The
400,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Indianapolis Mirror accepted two or three shorter verses but in
401,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,doing so suggested that in the future he try prose.  Being but an
402,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"humble beginner, Riley harkened to the advice, whereupon the"
403,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,editor made a further suggestion; this time that he try poetry
404,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"again.  The Danbury (Connecticut) News, then at the height of its"
405,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"humorous reputation, accepted a contribution shortly after The"
406,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Mirror episode and Mr. McGeechy, its managing editor, wrote the"
407,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,young poet a graceful note of congratulation.  Commenting on
408,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"these parlous times, Riley afterward wrote, ""It is strange how"

413,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"arrived my first check, a payment from Hearth and Home for a"

434,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,hoax.  He was then writing for an audience of county papers and
435,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,never dreamed that this whimsical bit of fooling would be carried
436,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,beyond such boundaries.  It was suggested by these circumstances.
437,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
438,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,He was inwardly distressed by the belief that his failure to get

450,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and mellifluous vowels and sonorous words.  I remember that I was
451,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"a long time in evolving the name Leonainie, but at length the"

467,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"hope.  But over in Indianapolis, twenty miles away, happier"
468,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"circumstances were shaping themselves.  Judge E. B. Martindale,"
469,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"editor and proprietor of The Indianapolis Journal, had been"
470,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,attracted by certain poems in various papers over the state and
471,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,at the very time that the poet was ready to confess himself
472,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"beaten, the judge wrote:  ""Come over to Indianapolis and we'll"
473,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"give you, a place on The Journal.""  Mr. Riley went.  That was the"
474,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"turning point, and though the skies were not always clear, nor"
475,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the way easy, still from that time it was ever an ascending"
476,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,journey.  As soon as he was comfortably settled in his new
477,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"position, the first of the Benj. F. Johnson poems made its"
478,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,appearance.  These dialect verses were introduced with editorial
479,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"comment as coming from an old Boone county farmer, and their"
480,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"reception was so cordial, so enthusiastic, indeed, that the"
481,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"business manager of The Journal, Mr. George C. Hitt, privately"
482,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,published them in pamphlet form and sold the first edition of one
483,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,thousand copies in local bookstores and over The Journal office
484,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,counter.  This marked an epoch in the young poet's progress and
485,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,was the beginning of a friendship between him and Mr. Hitt that
486,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,has never known interruption.  This first edition of The Old
487,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Swimmin' Hole and 'Leven More Poems has since become extremely
488,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,rare and now commands a high premium.  A second edition was
489,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"promptly issued by a local book dealer, whose successors, The"
490,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Bowen-Merrill Company--now The Bobbs-Merrill Company--have
491,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"continued, practically without interruption, to publish Riley's"
492,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,work.
493,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
494,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,The call to read from the public platform had by this time become
495,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"so insistent that Riley could no longer resist it, although"
496,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,modesty and shyness fought the battle for privacy.  He told
497,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,briefly and in his own inimitable fashion of these trying
498,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"experiences.  ""In boyhood I had been vividly impressed with"
499,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Dickens' success in reading from his own works and dreamed that
500,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,some day I might follow his example.  At first I read at Sunday-
501,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"school entertainments and later, on special occasions such as"
502,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Memorial Days and Fourth of Julys.  At last I mustered up
503,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"sufficient courage to read in a city theater, where, despite the"
504,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"conspiracy of a rainy night and a circus, I got encouragement"
505,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"enough to lead me to extend my efforts.  And so, my native state"
506,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and then the country at large were called upon to bear with me
507,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and I think I visited every sequestered spot north or south
508,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,particularly distinguished for poor railroad connections.  At
509,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"different times, I shared the program with Mark Twain, Robert J."
510,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Burdette and George Cable, and for a while my gentlest and"
511,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"cheeriest of friends, Bill Nye, joined with me and made the dusty"
512,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,detested travel almost a delight.  We were constantly playing
513,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,practical jokes on each other or indulging in some mischievous
514,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"banter before the audience.  On one occasion, Mr. Nye, coming"
515,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"before the foot-lights for a word of general introduction, said,"
516,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"'Ladies and gentlemen, the entertainment to-night is of a dual"
517,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,nature.  Mr. Riley and I will speak alternately.  First I come
518,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"out and talk until I get tired, then Mr. Riley comes out and"
519,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,talks until YOU get tired!'  And thus the trips went merrily
520,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,enough at times and besides I learned to know in Bill Nye a man
521,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,blessed with as noble and heroic a heart as ever beat.  But the
522,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"making of trains, which were all in conspiracy to outwit me,"
523,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"schedule or no schedule, and the rush and tyrannical pressure of"
524,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"inviolable engagements, some hundred to a season and from Boston"
525,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"to San Francisco, were a distress to my soul.  I am glad that's"
526,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,over with.  Imagine yourself on a crowded day-long excursion;
527,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,imagine that you had to ride all the way on the platform of the
528,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,car; then imagine that you had to ride all the way back on the
529,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"same platform; and lastly, try to imagine how you would feel if"
530,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"you did that every day of your life, and you will then get a"
531,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,glimmer--a faint glimmer--of how one feels after traveling about
532,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,on a reading or lecturing tour.
533,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
534,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""All this time I had been writing whenever there was any strength"
535,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,left in me.  I could not resist the inclination to write.  It was
536,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"what I most enjoyed doing.  And so I wrote, laboriously ever,"
537,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,more often using the rubber end of the pencil than the point.
538,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
539,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""In my readings I had an opportunity to study and find out for"
540,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"myself what the public wants, and afterward I would endeavor to"
541,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,use the knowledge gained in my writing.  The public desires
542,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"nothing but what is absolutely natural, and so perfectly natural"
543,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"as to be fairly artless.  It can not tolerate affectation, and it"
544,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,takes little interest in the classical production.  It demands
545,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,simple sentiments that come direct from the heart.  While on the
546,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,lecture platform I watched the effect that my readings had on the
547,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,audience very closely and whenever anybody left the hall I knew
548,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,that my recitation was at fault and tried to find out why.  Once
549,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,a man and his wife made an exit while I was giving The Happy
550,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Little Cripple--a recitation I had prepared with particular
551,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"enthusiasm and satisfaction.  It fulfilled, as few poems do, all"
552,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the requirements of length, climax and those many necessary"
553,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,features for a recitation.  The subject was a theme of real
554,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"pathos, beautified by the cheer and optimism of the little"
555,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,sufferer.  Consequently when this couple left the hall I was very
556,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,anxious to know the reason and asked a friend to find out.  He
557,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,learned that they had a little hunch-back child of their own.
558,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,After this experience I never used that recitation again.  On the
559,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"other hand, it often required a long time for me to realize that"
560,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the public would enjoy a poem which, because of some blind"
561,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"impulse, I thought unsuitable.  Once a man said to me, 'Why don't"
562,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,you recite When the Frost Is on the Punkin?' The use of it had
563,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,never occurred to me for I thought it 'wouldn't go.'  He
564,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,persuaded me to try it and it became one of my most favored
565,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"recitations.  Thus, I learned to judge and value my verses by"
566,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"their effect upon the public.  Occasionally, at first, I had"
567,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"presumed to write 'over the heads' of the audience, consoling"
568,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,myself for the cool reception by thinking my auditors were not of
569,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,sufficient intellectual height to appreciate my efforts.  But
570,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,after a time it came home to me that I myself was at fault in
571,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"these failures, and then I disliked anything that did not appeal"
572,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,to the public and learned to discriminate between that which did
573,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,not ring true to my hearers and that which won them by virtue of
574,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"its truthfulness and was simply heart high."""
575,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
576,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"As a reader of his own poems, as a teller of humorous stories, as"
577,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"a mimic, indeed as a finished actor, Riley's genius was rare and"
578,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"beyond question.  In a lecture on the Humorous Story, Mark Twain,"
579,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,referring to the story of the One Legged Soldier and the
580,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"different ways of telling it, once said:"
581,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
582,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""It takes only a minute and a half to tell it in its comic form;"
583,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and it isn't worth telling after all.  Put into the

585,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,funniest thing I have ever listened to--as James Whitcomb Riley

590,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,a performance which is thoroughly charming and delicious.  This

593,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
594,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,It was in  that The Old Swimmin' Hole and 'Leven More
595,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Poems first appeared in volume form.  Four years afterward, Riley"
596,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,made his initial appearance before a New York City audience.  The
597,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"entertainment was given in aid of an international copyright law,"
598,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and the country's most distinguished men of letters took part in
599,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,the program.  It is probably true that no one appearing at that
600,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,time was less known to the vast audience in Chickering Hall than
601,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"James Whitcomb Riley, but so great and so spontaneous was the"
602,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,enthusiasm when he left the stage after his contribution to the

604,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,place would be made for Mr. Riley on the second and last day's
605,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,program.  It was then that James Russell Lowell introduced him in

610,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Riley, of Indiana.  I confess, with no little chagrin and sense"
611,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"of my own loss, that when yesterday afternoon, from this"
612,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"platform, I presented him to a similar assemblage, I was almost"
613,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,completely a stranger to his poems.  But since that time I have
614,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"been looking into the volumes that have come from his pen, and in"
615,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,them I have discovered so much of high worth and tender quality
616,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,that I deeply regret I had not long before made acquaintance with
617,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"his work.  To-day, in presenting Mr. Riley to you, I can say to"

622,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Two years later a selection from his poems was published in
623,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,England under the title Old Fashioned Roses and his
624,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,international reputation was established.  In his own country the
625,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,people had already conferred their highest degrees on him and now
626,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,the colleges and universities--seats of conservatism--gave him
627,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,scholastic recognition.  Yale made him an Honorary Master of Arts
628,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"in 1902; in 1903, Wabash and, a year later, the University of"
629,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Pennsylvania conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Letters,"
630,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and in 1907 Indiana University gave him his LL. D.  Still more
631,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,recently the Academy of Arts and Letters elected him to
632,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"membership, and in 1912 awarded him the gold medal for poetry."
633,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"About this time a yet dearer, more touching tribute came to him"
634,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"from school children.  On October 7, 1911, the schools of Indiana"
635,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"and New York City celebrated his birthday by special exercises,"
636,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"and one year later, the school children of practically every"
637,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,section of the country had programs in his honor.
638,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
639,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,As these distinguished honors came they found him each time
640,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"surprised anew and, though proud that they who dwell in the high"
641,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"places of learning should come in cap and gown to welcome him,"
642,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,yet gently and sincerely protesting his own unworthiness.  And as
643,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,they found him when they came so they left him.
644,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
645,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Mr. Riley made his home in Indianapolis from the time judge
646,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Martindale invited him to join The Journal's forces, and no one"
647,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"of her citizens was more devoted, nor was any so universally"
648,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,loved and honored.  Everywhere he went the tribute of quick
649,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"recognition and cheery greeting was paid him, and his home was"
650,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,the shrine of every visiting Hoosier.  High on a sward of velvet
651,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,grass stands a dignified middle-aged brick house.  A dwarfed
652,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"stone wall, broken by an iron gate, guards the front lawn, while"
653,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,in the rear an old-fashioned garden revels in hollyhocks and wild
654,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,roses.  Here among his books and his souvenirs the poet spent his
655,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"happy and contented days.  To reach this restful spot, the"
656,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"pilgrim must journey to Lockerbie Street, a miniature"
657,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,thoroughfare half hidden between two more commanding avenues.  It
658,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"is little more than a lane, shaded, unpaved and from end to end"
659,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"no longer than a five minutes' walk, but its fame is for all"
660,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,time.
661,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
662,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""Such a dear little street it is, nestled away"
663,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"From the noise of the city and heat of the day,"
664,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"In cool shady coverts of whispering trees,"
665,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,With their leaves lifted up to shake hands with the breeze
666,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Which in all its wide wanderings never may meet
667,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"With a resting-place fairer than Lockerbie Street!"""
668,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
669,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
670,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Riley never married.  He lived with devoted, loyal and"
671,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"understanding friends, a part of whose life he became many years"
672,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"ago.  Kindly consideration, gentle affection, peace and order,--"
673,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"all that go to make home home, were found here blooming with the"
674,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,hollyhocks and the wild roses.  Every day some visitor knocked
675,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,for admittance and was not denied; every day saw the poet calling
676,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,for some companionable friend and driving with him through the
677,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,city's shaded streets or far out into the country.
678,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
679,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,And so his life drew on to its last and most beautiful year.
680,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Since his serious illness in 1910, the public had shown its love"
681,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,for him more and more frequently.  On the occasion of his
682,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"birthday in 1912, Greenfield had welcomed him home through a host"
683,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"of children scattering flowers.  Anderson, where he was living"
684,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"when he first gained public recognition, had a Riley Day in 1913."
685,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
686,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"The Indiana State University entertained him the same year, as"
687,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,did also the city of Cincinnati.  In 1915 there was a Riley Day
688,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"at Columbus, Indiana, and during all this time each birthday and"
689,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Christmas was marked by ""poetry-showers,"" and by thousands of"
690,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,letters of affectionate congratulation and by many tributes in
691,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,the newspapers and magazines.
692,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
693,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"His last birthday, October 7, 1915, was the most notable of all."
694,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Honorable Franklin K. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, suggested"
695,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,to the various school superintendents that one of Riley's poems
696,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"be read in each schoolhouse, with the result that Riley"
697,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,celebrations were general among the children of the entire
698,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,country.  In a proclamation by Governor Ralston the State of
699,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Indiana designated the anniversary as Riley Day in honor of its
700,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"""most beloved citizen.""  Thousands of letters and gifts from the"
701,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,poet's friends poured in--letters from schools and organizations
702,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,and Riley Clubs as well as from individuals--while flowers came
703,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"from every section of the country.  Among them all, perhaps the"
704,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,poet was most pleased with a bunch of violets picked from the
705,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,banks of the Brandywine by the children of a Riley school.
706,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
707,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,It was on this last birthday that an afternoon festival of Riley
708,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,poems set to music and danced in pantomime took place at
709,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Indianapolis.  This was followed at night by a dinner in his
710,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"honor at which Charles Warren Fairbanks presided, and the"
711,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"speakers were Governor Ralston, Doctor John Finley, Colonel"
712,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"George Harvey, Young E. Allison, William Allen White, George Ade,"
713,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,Ex-Senator Beveridge and Senator Kern.  That night Riley smiled
714,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"his most wonderful smile, his dimpled boyish smile, and when he"
715,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,rose to speak it was with a perceptible quaver in his voice that
716,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"he said:  ""Everywhere the faces of friends, a beautiful throng of"
717,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"friends!"""
718,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
719,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"The winter and spring following, Riley spent quietly at Miami,"
720,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"Florida, where he had gone the two previous seasons to escape the"
721,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,cold and the rain.  There was a Riley Day at Miami in February.
722,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"In April, he returned home, feeling at his best, and, as if by"
723,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"premonition, sought out many of his friends, new and old, and"
724,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,took them for last rides in his automobile.  A few days before
725,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"the end, he visited Greenfield to attend the funeral of a dear"
726,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"boyhood chum, Almon Keefer, of whom he wrote in A Child-World."
727,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,All Riley's old friends who were still left in Greenfield were
728,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,gathered there and to them he spoke words of faith and good
729,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"cheer.  Almon Keefer had ""just slipped out"" quietly and"
730,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"peacefully, he said, and ""it was beautiful."""
731,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,
732,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,And as quietly and peacefully his own end came--as he had desired
733,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"it, with no dimming of the faculties even to the very close, nor"
734,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"suffering, nor confronting death.  This was Saturday night, July"
735,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"22, 1916.  On Monday afternoon and evening his body lay in state"
736,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"under the dome of Indiana's capitol, while the people filed by,"
737,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"thousands upon thousands.  Business men were there, and"
738,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"schoolgirls, matrons carrying market baskets, mothers with little"
739,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"children, here and there a swarthy foreigner, old folks, too, and"
740,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"well-dressed youths, here a farmer and his wife, and there a"
741,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"workman in a blue jumper with his hat in his band, silent,"
742,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"inarticulate, yet bidding his good-by, too.  On the following"
743,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,"day, with only his nearest and dearest about him, all that was"
744,JAMES WHITCOMB RILEY--A SKETCH,mortal of the people's poet was quietly and simply laid to rest.

751,A BACKWARD LOOK,A BACKWARD LOOK
752,A BACKWARD LOOK,
753,A BACKWARD LOOK,"As I sat smoking, alone, yesterday,"
754,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And lazily leaning back in my chair,"
755,A BACKWARD LOOK,Enjoying myself in a general way--
756,A BACKWARD LOOK,Allowing my thoughts a holiday
757,A BACKWARD LOOK,"From weariness, toil and care,--"
758,A BACKWARD LOOK,"My fancies--doubtless, for ventilation--"
759,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Left ajar the gates of my mind,--"
760,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And Memory, seeing the situation,"
761,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Slipped out in the street of ""Auld Lang Syne.""--"
762,A BACKWARD LOOK,
763,A BACKWARD LOOK,
764,A BACKWARD LOOK,Wandering ever with tireless feet
765,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Through scenes of silence, and jubilee"
766,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet
767,A BACKWARD LOOK,Were thronging the shadowy side of the street
768,A BACKWARD LOOK,As far as the eye could see;
769,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Dreaming again, in anticipation,"
770,A BACKWARD LOOK,The same old dreams of our boyhood's days
771,A BACKWARD LOOK,"That never come true, from the vague sensation"
772,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of walking asleep in the world's strange ways.
773,A BACKWARD LOOK,
774,A BACKWARD LOOK,Away to the house where I was born!
775,A BACKWARD LOOK,And there was the selfsame clock that ticked
776,A BACKWARD LOOK,"From the close of dusk to the burst of morn,"
777,A BACKWARD LOOK,When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn
778,A BACKWARD LOOK,And helped when the apples were picked.
779,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And the ""chany dog"" on the mantel-shelf,"
780,A BACKWARD LOOK,"With the gilded collar and yellow eyes,"
781,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Looked just as at first, when I hugged myself"
782,A BACKWARD LOOK,Sound asleep with the dear surprise.
783,A BACKWARD LOOK,
784,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And down to the swing in the locust-tree,"
785,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground,"
786,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And where ""Eck"" Skinner, ""Old"" Carr, and three"
787,A BACKWARD LOOK,Or four such other boys used to be
788,A BACKWARD LOOK,"""Doin' sky-scrapers,"" or ""whirlin' round"":"
789,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And again Bob climbed for the bluebird's nest,"
790,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And again ""had shows"" in the buggy-shed"
791,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Of Guymon's barn, where still, unguessed,"
792,A BACKWARD LOOK,The old ghosts romp through the best days dead!
793,A BACKWARD LOOK,
794,A BACKWARD LOOK,And again I gazed from the old schoolroom
795,A BACKWARD LOOK,"With a wistful look, of a long June day,"
796,A BACKWARD LOOK,When on my cheek was the hectic bloom
797,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Caught of Mischief, as I presume--"
798,A BACKWARD LOOK,"He had such a ""partial"" way,"
799,A BACKWARD LOOK,"It seemed, toward me.--And again I thought"
800,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of a probable likelihood to be
801,A BACKWARD LOOK,Kept in after school--for a girl was caught
802,A BACKWARD LOOK,Catching a note from me.
803,A BACKWARD LOOK,
804,A BACKWARD LOOK,And down through the woods to the swimming-hole--
805,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Where the big, white, hollow old sycamore grows,--"
806,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And we never cared when the water was cold,"
807,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And always ""ducked"" the boy that told"
808,A BACKWARD LOOK,On the fellow that tied the clothes.--
809,A BACKWARD LOOK,"When life went so like a dreamy rhyme,"
810,A BACKWARD LOOK,That it seems to me now that then
811,A BACKWARD LOOK,The world was having a jollier time
812,A BACKWARD LOOK,Than it ever will have again.

817,PHILIPER FLASH,
818,PHILIPER FLASH,"Young Philiper Flash was a promising lad,"
819,PHILIPER FLASH,"His intentions were good--but oh, how sad"
820,PHILIPER FLASH,For a person to think
821,PHILIPER FLASH,How the veriest pink
822,PHILIPER FLASH,And bloom of perfection may turn out bad.
823,PHILIPER FLASH,"Old Flash himself was a moral man,"
824,PHILIPER FLASH,"And prided himself on a moral plan,"
825,PHILIPER FLASH,Of a maxim as old
826,PHILIPER FLASH,"As the calf of gold,"
827,PHILIPER FLASH,Of making that boy do what he was told.
828,PHILIPER FLASH,
829,PHILIPER FLASH,And such a good mother had Philiper Flash;
830,PHILIPER FLASH,Her voice was as soft as the creamy plash
831,PHILIPER FLASH,Of the milky wave
832,PHILIPER FLASH,With its musical lave
833,PHILIPER FLASH,That gushed through the holes of her patent churn-dash;--
834,PHILIPER FLASH,"And the excellent woman loved Philiper so,"
835,PHILIPER FLASH,"She could cry sometimes when he stumped his toe,--"
836,PHILIPER FLASH,And she stroked his hair
837,PHILIPER FLASH,With such motherly care
838,PHILIPER FLASH,When the dear little angel learned to swear.
839,PHILIPER FLASH,
840,PHILIPER FLASH,Old Flash himself would sometimes say
841,PHILIPER FLASH,"That his wife had ""such a ridiculous way,--"
842,PHILIPER FLASH,"She'd, humor that child"
843,PHILIPER FLASH,"Till he'd soon be sp'iled,"
844,PHILIPER FLASH,"And then there'd be the devil to pay!"""
845,PHILIPER FLASH,"And the excellent wife, with a martyr's look,"
846,PHILIPER FLASH,"Would tell old Flash himself ""he took"
847,PHILIPER FLASH,No notice at all
848,PHILIPER FLASH,Of the bright-eyed doll
849,PHILIPER FLASH,"Unless when he spanked him for getting a fall!"""
850,PHILIPER FLASH,
851,PHILIPER FLASH,"Young Philiper Flash, as time passed by,"
852,PHILIPER FLASH,"Grew into ""a boy with a roguish eye"":"
853,PHILIPER FLASH,"He could smoke a cigar,"
854,PHILIPER FLASH,And seemed by far
855,PHILIPER FLASH,"The most promising youth.--""He's powerful sly,"
856,PHILIPER FLASH,"Old Flash himself once told a friend,"
857,PHILIPER FLASH,"""Every copper he gets he's sure to spend--"
858,PHILIPER FLASH,"And,"" said he, ""don't you know"
859,PHILIPER FLASH,If he keeps on so

862,PHILIPER FLASH,But his dear good mother knew Philiper's ways
863,PHILIPER FLASH,"So--well, she managed the money to raise;"
864,PHILIPER FLASH,And old Flash himself
865,PHILIPER FLASH,"Was ""laid on the shelf,"""
866,PHILIPER FLASH,(In the manner of speaking we have nowadays).
867,PHILIPER FLASH,"For ""gracious knows, her darling child,"
868,PHILIPER FLASH,"If he went without money he'd soon grow wild."""
869,PHILIPER FLASH,So Philiper Flash
870,PHILIPER FLASH,With a regular dash
871,PHILIPER FLASH,"""Swung on to the reins,"" and went ""slingin' the cash."""
872,PHILIPER FLASH,
873,PHILIPER FLASH,"As old Flash himself, in his office one day,"
874,PHILIPER FLASH,"Was shaving notes in a barberous way,"
875,PHILIPER FLASH,At the hour of four
876,PHILIPER FLASH,Death entered the door
877,PHILIPER FLASH,"And shaved the note on his life, they say."
878,PHILIPER FLASH,"And he had for his grave a magnificent tomb,"
879,PHILIPER FLASH,"Though the venturous finger that pointed ""Gone Home,"""
880,PHILIPER FLASH,Looked white and cold
881,PHILIPER FLASH,"From being so bold,"
882,PHILIPER FLASH,As it feared that a popular lie was told.
883,PHILIPER FLASH,
884,PHILIPER FLASH,Young Philiper Flash was a man of style
885,PHILIPER FLASH,When he first began unpacking the pile
886,PHILIPER FLASH,Of the dollars and dimes
887,PHILIPER FLASH,Whose jingling chimes
888,PHILIPER FLASH,Had clinked to the tune of his father's smile;
889,PHILIPER FLASH,"And he strewed his wealth with such lavish hand,"
890,PHILIPER FLASH,"His rakish ways were the talk of the land,"
891,PHILIPER FLASH,And gossipers wise
892,PHILIPER FLASH,Sat winking their eyes
893,PHILIPER FLASH,(A certain foreboding of fresh surprise).
894,PHILIPER FLASH,
895,PHILIPER FLASH,"A ""fast young man"" was Philiper Flash,"
896,PHILIPER FLASH,"And wore ""loud clothes"" and a weak mustache,"
897,PHILIPER FLASH,"And ""done the Park,"""
898,PHILIPER FLASH,"For an ""afternoon lark,"""
899,PHILIPER FLASH,"With a very fast horse of ""remarkable dash."""
900,PHILIPER FLASH,And Philiper handled a billiard-cue
901,PHILIPER FLASH,"About as well as the best he knew,"
902,PHILIPER FLASH,And used to say
903,PHILIPER FLASH,"""He could make it pay"
904,PHILIPER FLASH,"By playing two or three games a day."""
905,PHILIPER FLASH,
906,PHILIPER FLASH,"And Philiper Flash was his mother's joy,"
907,PHILIPER FLASH,He seemed to her the magic alloy
908,PHILIPER FLASH,"That made her glad,"
909,PHILIPER FLASH,"When her heart was sad,"
910,PHILIPER FLASH,"With the thought that ""she lived for her darling boy."""
911,PHILIPER FLASH,His dear good mother wasn't aware
912,PHILIPER FLASH,"How her darling boy relished a ""tare.""--"
913,PHILIPER FLASH,"She said ""one night"
914,PHILIPER FLASH,He gave her a fright
915,PHILIPER FLASH,"By coming home late and ACTING tight."""
916,PHILIPER FLASH,
917,PHILIPER FLASH,"Young Philiper Flash, on a winterish day,"
918,PHILIPER FLASH,"Was published a bankrupt, so they say--"
919,PHILIPER FLASH,And as far as I know
920,PHILIPER FLASH,"I suppose it was so,"
921,PHILIPER FLASH,For matters went on in a singular way;
922,PHILIPER FLASH,"His excellent mother, I think I was told,"
923,PHILIPER FLASH,Died from exposure and want and cold;
924,PHILIPER FLASH,"And Philiper Flash,"
925,PHILIPER FLASH,"With a horrible slash,"
926,PHILIPER FLASH,Whacked his jugular open and went to smash.

1020,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,
1021,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,There wasn't two purtier farms in the state
1022,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Than the couple of which I'm about to relate;--
1023,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Jinin' each other--belongin' to Brown,"
1024,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And jest at the edge of a flourishin' town.
1025,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Brown was a man, as I understand,"
1026,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"That allus had handled a good 'eal o' land,"
1027,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And was sharp as a tack in drivin' a trade--
1028,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,For that's the way most of his money was made.
1029,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And all the grounds and the orchards about
1030,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,His two pet farms was all tricked out
1031,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,With poppies and posies
1032,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And sweet-smellin' rosies;
1033,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And hundreds o' kinds
1034,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Of all sorts o' vines,"
1035,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,To tickle the most horticultural minds
1036,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And little dwarf trees not as thick as your wrist
1037,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,With ripe apples on 'em as big as your fist:
1038,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And peaches,--Siberian crabs and pears,"
1039,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And quinces--Well! ANY fruit ANY tree bears;
1040,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And th purtiest stream--jest a-swimmin' with fish,"
1041,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And--JEST O'MOST EVERYTHING HEART COULD WISH!
1042,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,The purtiest orch'rds--I wish you could see
1043,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"How purty they was, fer I know it 'ud be"
1044,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,A regular treat!--but I'll go ahead with
1045,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,My story!  A man by the name o' Smith--
1046,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"(A bad name to rhyme,"
1047,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,But I reckon that I'm
1048,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Not goin' back on a Smith! nary time!)
1049,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"'At hadn't a soul of kin nor kith,"
1050,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And more money than he knowed what to do with,--"
1051,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"So he comes a-ridin' along one day,"
1052,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And HE says to Brown, in his offhand way--"
1053,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Who was trainin' some newfangled vines round a bay-
1054,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Winder--""Howdy-do--look-a-here--say:"
1055,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,What'll you take fer this property here?--
1056,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"I'm talkin' o' leavin' the city this year,"
1057,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And I want to be
1058,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Where the air is free,"
1059,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And I'll BUY this place, if it ain't too dear!""--"
1060,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Well--they grumbled and jawed aroun'--
1061,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"""I don't like to part with the place,"" says Brown;"
1062,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"""Well,"" says Smith, a-jerkin' his head,"
1063,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"""That house yonder--bricks painted red--"
1064,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Jest like this'n--a PURTIER VIEW--
1065,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Who is it owns it?""  ""That's mine too,"""
1066,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Says Brown, as he winked at a hole in his shoe,"
1067,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"""But I'll tell you right here jest what I KIN do:--"
1068,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"If you'll pay the figgers I'll sell IT to you.,"""
1069,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Smith went over and looked at the place--
1070,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Badgered with Brown, and argied the case--"
1071,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Thought that Brown's figgers was rather too tall,"
1072,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"But, findin' that Brown wasn't goin' to fall,"
1073,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"In final agreed,"
1074,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,So they drawed up the deed
1075,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Fer the farm and the fixtures--the live stock an' all.
1076,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And so Smith moved from the city as soon
1077,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"As he possibly could--But ""the man in the moon"""
1078,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Knowed more'n Smith o' farmin' pursuits,"
1079,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And jest to convince you, and have no disputes,"
1080,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"How little he knowed,"
1081,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"I'll tell you his ""mode,"""
1082,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"As he called it, o' raisin' ""the best that growed,"""
1083,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,In the way o' potatoes--
1084,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Cucumbers--tomatoes,"
1085,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And squashes as lengthy as young alligators.
1086,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,'Twas allus a curious thing to me
1087,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,How big a fool a feller kin be
1088,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,When he gits on a farm after leavin' a town!--
1089,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Expectin' to raise himself up to renown,"
1090,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And reap fer himself agricultural fame,"
1091,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,By growin' of squashes--WITHOUT ANY SHAME--
1092,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,As useless and long as a technical name.
1093,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"To make the soil pure,"
1094,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And certainly sure,"
1095,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,He plastered the ground with patent manure.
1096,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"He had cultivators, and double-hoss plows,"
1097,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And patent machines fer milkin' his cows;
1098,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And patent hay-forks--patent measures and weights,"
1099,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And new patent back-action hinges fer gates,"
1100,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And barn locks and latches, and such little dribs,"
1101,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And patents to keep the rats out o' the cribs--
1102,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Reapers and mowers,"
1103,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And patent grain sowers;
1104,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And drillers
1105,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And tillers
1106,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And cucumber hillers,"
1107,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And horries;--and had patent rollers and scrapers,"
1108,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And took about ten agricultural papers.
1109,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,So you can imagine how matters turned out:
1110,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,But BROWN didn't have not a shadder o' doubt
1111,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,That Smith didn't know what he was about
1112,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"When he said that ""the OLD way to farm was played out."""
1113,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"But Smith worked ahead,"
1114,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And when any one said
1115,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,That the OLD way o' workin' was better instead
1116,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"O' his ""modern idees,"" he allus turned red,"
1117,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And wanted to know
1118,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,What made people so
1119,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,INFERNALLY anxious to hear theirselves crow?
1120,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And guessed that he'd manage to hoe his own row.
1121,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Brown he come onc't and leant over the fence,"
1122,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And told Smith that he couldn't see any sense
1123,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,In goin' to such a tremendous expense
1124,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Fer the sake o' such no-account experiments
1125,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"""That'll never make corn!"
1126,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,As shore's you're born
1127,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"It'll come out the leetlest end of the horn!"""
1128,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Says Brown, as he pulled off a big roastin'-ear"
1129,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,From a stalk of his own
1130,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,That had tribble outgrown
1131,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Smith's poor yaller shoots, and says he, ""Looky here!"
1132,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"THIS corn was raised in the old-fashioned way,"
1133,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And I rather imagine that THIS corn'll pay
1134,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Expenses fer RAISIN' it!--What do you say?"""
1135,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Brown got him then to look over his crop.--
1136,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,HIS luck that season had been tip-top!
1137,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And you may surmise
1138,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Smith opened his eyes
1139,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And let out a look o' the wildest surprise
1140,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,When Brown showed him punkins as big as the lies
1141,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,He was stuffin' him with--about offers he's had
1142,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Fer his farm:  ""I don't want to sell very bad,"""
1143,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"He says, but says he,"
1144,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"""Mr. Smith, you kin see"
1145,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Fer yourself how matters is standin' with me,"
1146,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"I UNDERSTAND FARMIN' and I'd better stay,"
1147,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"You know, on my farm;--I'm a-makin' it pay--"
1148,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,I oughtn't to grumble!--I reckon I'll clear
1149,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Away over four thousand dollars this year."""
1150,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"And that was the reason, he made it appear,"
1151,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Why he didn't care about sellin' his farm,"
1152,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And hinted at his havin' done himself harm
1153,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"In sellin' the other, and wanted to know"
1154,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,If Smith wouldn't sell back ag'in to him.--So
1155,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Smith took the bait, and says he, ""Mr. Brown,"
1156,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,I wouldn't SELL out but we might swap aroun'--
1157,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"How'll you trade your place fer mine?"""
1158,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,(Purty sharp way o' comin' the shine
1159,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Over Smith!  Wasn't it?) Well, sir, this Brown"
1160,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Played out his hand and brought Smithy down--
1161,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Traded with him an', workin' it cute,"
1162,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Raked in two thousand dollars to boot
1163,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"As slick as a whistle, an' that wasn't all,--"
1164,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"He managed to trade back ag'in the next fall,--"
1165,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And the next--and the next--as long as Smith stayed
1166,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,He reaped with his harvests an annual trade.--
1167,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"Why, I reckon that Brown must 'a' easily made--"
1168,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,On an AVERAGE--nearly two thousand a year--
1169,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Together he made over seven thousand--clear.--
1170,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Till Mr. Smith found he was losin' his health
1171,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"In as big a proportion, almost, as his wealth;"
1172,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"So at last he concluded to move back to town,"
1173,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And sold back his farm to this same Mr. Brown
1174,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,"At very low figgers, by gittin' it down."
1175,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Further'n this I have nothin' to say
1176,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,Than merely advisin' the Smiths fer to stay
1177,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,In their grocery stores in flourishin' towns
1178,WHAT SMITH KNEW ABOUT FARMING,And leave agriculture alone--and the Browns.

1353,"""YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR FATHER!""",Then I saw a glancing shadow

1355,"""YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR FATHER!""","Of a sea-gull flying seaward,"
1356,"""YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR FATHER!""",And I heard a gruff voice speak:--

1363,"""YOU LOOK SO LIKE YOUR FATHER!""",And as rough and gruff a sailor

1459,A SUMMER AFTERNOON,Affrightedly reviews itself again.
1460,A SUMMER AFTERNOON,
1461,A SUMMER AFTERNOON,Off through the haze that dances in the shine
1462,A SUMMER AFTERNOON,"The warm sun showers in the open glade,"

1642,ME--LAW!,Said I'd find myself mistakend when I come to look around.
1643,ME--LAW!,
1644,ME--LAW!,"So I bids good-by to Mother, and I jumps aboard the train,"
1645,ME--LAW!,A-thinkin' what I'd bring her when I come back home again--

1648,ME--LAW!,
1649,ME--LAW!,"Cars is awful tejus ridin', fer all they go so fast!"
1650,ME--LAW!,But finally they called out my stoppin'-place at last:
1651,ME--LAW!,"And that night, at the tavern, I dreamp' I was a train"
1652,ME--LAW!,"O' cars, and SKEERED at somepin', runnin' down a country lane!"
1653,ME--LAW!,
1654,ME--LAW!,"Well, in the morning airly--after huntin' up the man--"
1655,ME--LAW!,The lawyer who was wantin' to swap the piece o' land--
1656,ME--LAW!,We started fer the country; and I ast the history
1657,ME--LAW!,"Of the farm--its former owner--and so forth, etcetery!"
1658,ME--LAW!,
1659,ME--LAW!,"And--well--it was interESTin'--I su'prised him, I suppose,"
1660,ME--LAW!,By the loud and frequent manner in which I blowed my nose!--
1661,ME--LAW!,"But his su'prise was greater, and it made him wonder more,"
1662,ME--LAW!,When I kissed and hugged the widder when she met us at the

1667,ME--LAW!,"It was with us in that meetin', I don't want you to fergit!"
1668,ME--LAW!,And it makes me kind o'nervous when I think about it yit!
1669,ME--LAW!,
1670,ME--LAW!,"I BOUGHT that farm, and DEEDED it, afore I left the town"
1671,ME--LAW!,"With ""title clear to mansions in the skies,"" to Mary Brown!"

2423,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Or but a vain creation of a lover's memory?
2424,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"A fair, illusive vision that would vanish into air"
2425,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Dared I even touch the silence with the whisper of a prayer?
2426,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2427,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Nay, let me then believe in all the blended false and true--"
2428,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The semblance of the OLD love and the substance of the NEW,--"
2429,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,The THEN of changeless sunny days--the NOW of shower and shine--
2430,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,But Love forever smiling--as that old sweetheart of mine.
2431,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2432,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"This ever-restful sense of HOME, though shouts ring in the"

2434,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,The easy chair--the old book-shelves and prints along the wall;
2435,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The rare HABANAS in their box, or gaunt church-warden-stem"
2436,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"That often wags, above the jar, derisively at them."
2437,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2438,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As one who cons at evening o'er an album, all alone,"

2442,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2443,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The lamplight seems to glimmer with a flicker of surprise,"
2444,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As I turn it low--to rest me of the dazzle in my eyes,"
2445,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And light my pipe in silence, save a sigh that seems to yoke"
2446,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Its fate with my tobacco and to vanish with the smoke.
2447,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2448,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"'Tis a FRAGRANT retrospection,--for the loving thoughts that"
2449,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,start
2450,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Into being are like perfume from the blossom of the heart;
2451,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And to dream the old dreams over is a luxury divine--
2452,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When my truant fancies wander with that old sweetheart of mine.
2453,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2454,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Though I hear beneath my study, like a fluttering of wings,"
2455,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,The voices of my children and the mother as she sings--
2456,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I feel no twinge of conscience to deny me any theme
2457,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When Care has cast her anchor in the harbor of a dream--
2458,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2459,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"In fact, to speak in earnest, I believe it adds a charm"
2460,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"To spice the good a trifle with a little dust of harm,--"

2462,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,That makes me drink the deeper to that old sweetheart of mine.
2463,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2464,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,O Childhood-days enchanted!  O the magic of the Spring!--
2465,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"With all green boughs to blossom white, and all bluebirds to"

2467,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When all the air, to toss and quaff, made life a jubilee"
2468,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And changed the children's song and laugh to shrieks of ecstasy.
2469,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2470,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"With eyes half closed in clouds that ooze from lips that taste,"

2474,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"To smile, behind my ""lesson,"" at that old sweetheart of mine."
2475,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2476,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"A face of lily-beauty, with a form of airy grace,"
2477,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Floats out of my tobacco as the Genii from the vase;
2478,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And I thrill beneath the glances of a pair of azure eyes
2479,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,As glowing as the summer and as tender as the skies.
2480,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2481,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,I can see the pink sunbonnet and the little checkered dress
2482,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,She wore when first I kissed her and she answered the caress
2483,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"With the written declaration that, ""as surely as the vine"
2484,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Grew 'round the stump,"" she loved me--that old sweetheart of"

2486,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2487,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Again I made her presents, in a really helpless way,--"
2488,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"The big ""Rhode Island Greening""--I was hungry, too, that day!--"
2489,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"But I follow her from Spelling, with her hand behind her--so--"
2490,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And I slip the apple in it--and the Teacher doesn't know!
2491,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2492,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"I give my TREASURES to her--all,--my pencil--blue-and-red;--"
2493,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And, if little girls played marbles, MINE should all be HERS,"
2494,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,instead!
2495,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"But SHE gave me her PHOTOGRAPH, and printed ""Ever Thine"""
2496,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,Across the back--in blue-and-red--that old sweet-heart of mine!
2497,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2498,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And again I feel the pressure of her slender little hand,"
2499,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"As we used to talk together of the future we had planned,--"
2500,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When I should be a poet, and with nothing else to do"
2501,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,But write the tender verses that she set the music to . . .
2502,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2503,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,When we should live together in a cozy little cot
2504,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Hid in a nest of roses, with a fairy garden-spot,"
2505,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Where the vines were ever fruited, and the weather ever fine,"
2506,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And the birds were ever singing for that old sweetheart of mine.
2507,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2508,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"When I should be her lover forever and a day,"
2509,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And she my faithful sweetheart till the golden hair was gray;
2510,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,And we should be so happy that when either's lips were dumb
2511,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,They would not smile in Heaven till the other's kiss had come.
2512,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,
2513,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"But, ah! my dream is broken by a step upon the stair,"
2514,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"And the door is softly opened, and--my wife is standing there:"
2515,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,"Yet with eagerness and rapture all my visions I resign,--"
2516,AN OLD SWEETHEART OF MINE,To greet the LIVING presence of that old sweetheart of mine.

3430,II,What meed of tribute can the poet pay
3431,II,"The Soldier, but to trail the ivy-vine"
3432,II,Of idle rhyme above his grave to-day
3433,II,In epitaph design?--
3434,II,
3435,II,Or wreathe with laurel-words the icy brows
3436,II,"That ache no longer with a dream of fame,"
3437,II,"But, pillowed lowly in the narrow house,"
3438,II,Renowned beyond the name.
3439,II,
3440,II,"The dewy tear-drops of the night may fall,"
3441,II,And tender morning with her shining hand
3442,II,May brush them from the grasses green and tall
3443,II,That undulate the land.--
3444,II,
3445,II,"Yet song of Peace nor din of toil and thrift,"
3446,II,"Nor chanted honors, with the flowers we heap,"
3447,II,Can yield us hope the Hero's head to lift
3448,II,Out of its dreamless sleep:
3449,II,
3450,II,"The dear old Flag, whose faintest flutter flies"
3451,II,"A stirring echo through each patriot breast,"
3452,II,Can never coax to life the folded eyes
3453,II,That saw its wrongs redressed--
3454,II,
3455,II,"That watched it waver when the fight was hot,"
3456,II,"And blazed with newer courage to its aid,"
3457,II,Regardless of the shower of shell and shot
3458,II,Through which the charge was made;--
3459,II,
3460,II,"And when, at last, they saw it plume its wings,"
3461,II,"Like some proud bird in stormy element,"
3462,II,"And soar untrammeled on its wanderings,"
3463,II,"They closed in death, content."

3467,III,"O Mother, you who miss the smiling face"

3470,III,"He used to fill at night,--"
3471,III,
3472,III,"Who left you dazed, bewildered, on a day"
3473,III,"That echoed wild huzzas, and roar of guns"
3474,III,That drowned the farewell words you tried to say
3475,III,To incoherent ones;--
3476,III,
3477,III,Be glad and proud you had the life to give--
3478,III,"Be comforted through all the years to come,--"
3479,III,"Your country has a longer life to live,"
3480,III,Your son a better home.
3481,III,
3482,III,"O Widow, weeping o'er the orphaned child,"
3483,III,Who only lifts his questioning eyes to send
3484,III,"A keener pang to grief unreconciled,--"
3485,III,Teach him to comprehend
3486,III,
3487,III,He had a father brave enough to stand
3488,III,"Before the fire of Treason's blazing gun,"
3489,III,"That, dying, he might will the rich old land"
3490,III,Of Freedom to his son.
3491,III,
3492,III,"And, Maiden, living on through lonely years"
3493,III,"In fealty to love's enduring ties,--"
3494,III,With strong faith gleaming through the tender tears
3495,III,"That gather in your eyes,"
3496,III,
3497,III,"Look up! and own, in gratefulness of prayer,"
3498,III,Submission to the will of Heaven's High Host:--
3499,III,"I see your Angel-soldier pacing there,"
3500,III,Expectant at his post.--
3501,III,
3502,III,"I see the rank and file of armies vast,"
3503,III,That muster under one supreme control;
3504,III,I hear the trumpet sound the signal-blast--
3505,III,The calling of the roll--
3506,III,
3507,III,The grand divisions falling into line
3508,III,"And forming, under voice of One alone"
3509,III,"Who gives command, and joins with tongue divine"
3510,III,The hymn that shakes the Throne.

3516,IV,"And fragrance of the flowers they loved the best,"
3517,IV,In silence o'er the tomb.
3518,IV,
3519,IV,With reverent hands we twine the Hero's wreath
3520,IV,And clasp it tenderly on stake or stone
3521,IV,That stands the sentinel for each beneath
3522,IV,Whose glory is our own.
3523,IV,
3524,IV,"While in the violet that greets the sun,"
3525,IV,We see the azure eye of some lost boy;
3526,IV,And in the rose the ruddy cheek of one
3527,IV,"We kissed in childish joy,--"
3528,IV,
3529,IV,"Recalling, haply, when he marched away,"
3530,IV,He laughed his loudest though his eyes were wet.--
3531,IV,The kiss he gave his mother's brow that day
3532,IV,Is there and burning yet:
3533,IV,
3534,IV,"And through the storm of grief around her tossed,"
3535,IV,"One ray of saddest comfort she may see,--"
3536,IV,Four hundred thousand sons like hers were lost
3537,IV,To weeping Liberty.
3538,IV,
3539,IV,.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
3540,IV,"But draw aside the drapery of gloom,"
3541,IV,And let the sunshine chase the clouds away
3542,IV,And gild with brighter glory every tomb
3543,IV,We decorate to-day:
3544,IV,
3545,IV,"And in the holy silence reigning round,"
3546,IV,"While prayers of perfume bless the atmosphere,"
3547,IV,"Where loyal souls of love and faith are found,"
3548,IV,Thank God that Peace is here!
3549,IV,
3550,IV,"And let each angry impulse that may start,"
3551,IV,Be smothered out of every loyal breast;
3552,IV,"And, rocked within the cradle of the heart,"
3553,IV,Let every sorrow rest.

3607,AUGUST,Of Summer's passion:  In the sluggish stream
3608,AUGUST,"The panting cattle lave their lazy feet,"
3609,AUGUST,"With drowsy eyes, and dream."
3610,AUGUST,
3611,AUGUST,"Long since the winds have died, and in the sky"
3612,AUGUST,There lives no cloud to hint of Nature's grief;
3613,AUGUST,"The sun glares ever like an evil eye,"

3615,AUGUST,
3616,AUGUST,Upon the gleaming harvest-field remote
3617,AUGUST,"The thresher lies deserted, like some old"
3618,AUGUST,Dismantled galleon that hangs afloat
3619,AUGUST,Upon a sea of gold.
3620,AUGUST,
3621,AUGUST,The yearning cry of some bewildered bird
3622,AUGUST,"Above an empty nest, and truant boys"
3623,AUGUST,Along the river's shady margin heard--
3624,AUGUST,A harmony of noise--
3625,AUGUST,
3626,AUGUST,A melody of wrangling voices blent
3627,AUGUST,"With liquid laughter, and with rippling calls"
3628,AUGUST,Of piping lips and thrilling echoes sent
3629,AUGUST,To mimic waterfalls.
3630,AUGUST,
3631,AUGUST,And through the hazy veil the atmosphere
3632,AUGUST,"Has draped about the gleaming face of Day,"
3633,AUGUST,The sifted glances of the sun appear
3634,AUGUST,In splinterings of spray.
3635,AUGUST,
3636,AUGUST,"The dusty highway, like a cloud of dawn,"
3637,AUGUST,"Trails o'er the hillside, and the passer-by,"
3638,AUGUST,"A tired ghost in misty shroud, toils on"
3639,AUGUST,His journey to the sky.
3640,AUGUST,

3643,AUGUST,"The forest stands in silence, drinking deep"

3645,AUGUST,
3646,AUGUST,The gossamer floats up on phantom wing;
3647,AUGUST,The sailor-vision voyages the skies
3648,AUGUST,And carries into chaos everything
3649,AUGUST,That freights the weary eyes:
3650,AUGUST,
3651,AUGUST,"Till, throbbing on and on, the pulse of heat"
3652,AUGUST,"Increases--reaches--passes fever's height,"

3667,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,Where sunlight ever shone;
3668,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,"But now our aching eyes are dim,"
3669,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,And look through tears in vain for him.
3670,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,
3671,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,Name!  Name!  Name!
3672,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,It was his diadem;

3674,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,Could dim its luster--like a flame
3675,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,"Reflected in a gem,"

3680,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,Like dews upon the leaf

3682,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,The blossom of a trust appears
3683,DEAD IN SIGHT OF FAME,That blooms above the grief;

3691,IN THE DARK,What fancies haunt the brain!
3692,IN THE DARK,When even the sigh of the sleeper
3693,IN THE DARK,Sounds like a sob of pain.
3694,IN THE DARK,
3695,IN THE DARK,A sense of awe and of wonder
3696,IN THE DARK,"I may never well define,--"

3699,IN THE DARK,
3700,IN THE DARK,The old clock down in the parlor
3701,IN THE DARK,"Like a sleepless mourner grieves,"
3702,IN THE DARK,And the seconds drip in the silence
3703,IN THE DARK,As the rain drips from the eaves.
3704,IN THE DARK,
3705,IN THE DARK,And I think of the hands that signal
3706,IN THE DARK,"The hours there in the gloom,"
3707,IN THE DARK,And wonder what angel watchers
3708,IN THE DARK,Wait in the darkened room.
3709,IN THE DARK,
3710,IN THE DARK,And I think of the smiling faces
3711,IN THE DARK,"That used to watch and wait,"
3712,IN THE DARK,Till the click of the clock was answered
3713,IN THE DARK,By the click of the opening gate.--

3716,IN THE DARK,Morning or noon--not there;

3726,THE IRON HORSE,And greater strength and hardihood
3727,THE IRON HORSE,Than ever cantered wild and free
3728,THE IRON HORSE,Across the plains of Araby.

3734,THE IRON HORSE,And I defy you there to point
3735,THE IRON HORSE,Me out a steed the half so fine--
3736,THE IRON HORSE,From tip of ear to pastern-joint--
3737,THE IRON HORSE,As this old iron horse of mine.

3745,THE IRON HORSE,The sunlight on his burnished mane
3746,THE IRON HORSE,Is barely shaken in its place;
3747,THE IRON HORSE,"And at a touch he changes pace,"
3748,THE IRON HORSE,"And, gliding backward, stops again."
3749,THE IRON HORSE,
3750,THE IRON HORSE,"And talk of mettle--Ah! my friend,"
3751,THE IRON HORSE,Such passion smolders in his breast
3752,THE IRON HORSE,That when awakened it will send
3753,THE IRON HORSE,A thrill of rapture wilder than
3754,THE IRON HORSE,E'er palpitated heart of man
3755,THE IRON HORSE,When flaming at its mightiest.
3756,THE IRON HORSE,And there's a fierceness in his ire--
3757,THE IRON HORSE,A maddened majesty that leaps
3758,THE IRON HORSE,"Along his veins in blood of fire,"
3759,THE IRON HORSE,Until the path his vision sweeps
3760,THE IRON HORSE,Spins out behind him like a thread
3761,THE IRON HORSE,"Unraveled from the reel of time,"
3762,THE IRON HORSE,"As, wheeling on his course sublime,"
3763,THE IRON HORSE,The earth revolves beneath his tread.
3764,THE IRON HORSE,
3765,THE IRON HORSE,"Then stretch away, my gallant steed!"
3766,THE IRON HORSE,Thy mission is a noble one:
3767,THE IRON HORSE,"Thou bear'st the father to the son,"
3768,THE IRON HORSE,And sweet relief to bitter need;
3769,THE IRON HORSE,Thou bear'st the stranger to his friends;
3770,THE IRON HORSE,"Thou bear'st the pilgrim to the shrine,"
3771,THE IRON HORSE,And back again the prayer he sends
3772,THE IRON HORSE,"That God will prosper me and mine,--"
3773,THE IRON HORSE,The star that on thy forehead gleams
3774,THE IRON HORSE,Has blossomed in our brightest dreams.
3775,THE IRON HORSE,
3776,THE IRON HORSE,Then speed thee on thy glorious race!
3777,THE IRON HORSE,The mother waits thy ringing pace;
3778,THE IRON HORSE,The father leans an anxious ear
3779,THE IRON HORSE,The thunder of thy hooves to hear;
3780,THE IRON HORSE,"The lover listens, far away,"
3781,THE IRON HORSE,To catch thy keen exultant neigh;
3782,THE IRON HORSE,"And, where thy breathings roll and rise,"
3783,THE IRON HORSE,"The husband strains his eager eyes,"
3784,THE IRON HORSE,And laugh of wife and baby-glee
3785,THE IRON HORSE,Ring out to greet and welcome thee.
3786,THE IRON HORSE,Then stretch away! and when at last
3787,THE IRON HORSE,The master's hand shall gently check
3788,THE IRON HORSE,"Thy mighty speed, and hold thee fast,"
3789,THE IRON HORSE,The world will pat thee on the neck.

4137,I,"With haggard face and tangled hair,"
4138,I,And eyes that nursed as wild a care
4139,I,As gaunt Starvation ever can;
4140,I,And in his hand he held a wand
4141,I,Whose magic touch gave life and thought
4142,I,Unto a form his fancy wrought
4143,I,"And robed with coloring so grand,"
4144,I,It seemed the reflex of some child
4145,I,"Of Heaven, fair and undefiled--"
4146,I,A face of purity and love--
4147,I,To woo him into worlds above:
4148,I,"And as I gazed with dazzled eyes,"
4149,I,A gleaming smile lit up his lips
4150,I,As his bright soul from its eclipse
4151,I,Went flashing into Paradise.
4152,I,Then tardy Fame came through the door
4153,I,And found a picture--nothing more.

4163,II,"Save that the eyes might never weep,"
4164,II,"Nor weary hands be crossed in sleep,"
4165,II,"Nor hair that fell from crown to wrist,"
4166,II,"Be brushed away, caressed and kissed."
4167,II,"And as in awe I gazed on her,"

4180,III,"Who spoke of him at all, but spoke"
4181,III,Disparagingly of a mind
4182,III,The Fates had faultily designed:
4183,III,Too indolent for modern times--

4192,III,And of the sweet perfume it spilled
4193,III,"He drank to drunkenness, and flung"
4194,III,"His long hair back, and laughed and sung"
4195,III,And clapped his hands as children do
4196,III,"At fairy tales they listen to,"
4197,III,While from his flying quill there dripped
4198,III,Such music on his manuscript
4199,III,That he who listens to the words
4200,III,May close his eyes and dream the birds
4201,III,Are twittering on every hand
4202,III,A language he can understand.
4203,III,"He journeyed on through life, unknown,"
4204,III,Without one friend to call his own;
4205,III,He tired.  No kindly hand to press
4206,III,The cooling touch of tenderness
4207,III,"Upon his burning brow, nor lift"
4208,III,To his parched lips God's freest gift--
4209,III,No sympathetic sob or sigh
4210,III,Of trembling lips--no sorrowing eye
4211,III,Looked out through tears to see him die.
4212,III,And Fame her greenest laurels brought

4301,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,Sometimes an odor--or a rooster lifting
4302,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,"A far-off ""OOH! OOH-OOH!"""
4303,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,
4304,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,And suddenly we find ourselves astray
4305,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,In some wood's-pasture of the Long Ago--
4306,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,Or idly dream again upon a day
4307,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,Of rest we used to know.
4308,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,
4309,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,I bit an apple but a moment since--
4310,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,"A wilted apple that the worm had spurned,--"
4311,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,Yet hidden in the taste were happy hints
4312,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,Of good old days returned.--
4313,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,
4314,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,"And so my heart, like some enraptured lute,"
4315,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,"Tinkles a tune so tender and complete,"
4316,HONEY DRIPPING FROM THE COMB,God's blessing must be resting on the fruit--

4360,ORLIE WILDE,
4361,ORLIE WILDE,"A goddess, with a siren's grace,--"
4362,ORLIE WILDE,A sun-haired girl on a craggy place
4363,ORLIE WILDE,Above a bay where fish-boats lay
4364,ORLIE WILDE,Drifting about like birds of prey.
4365,ORLIE WILDE,
4366,ORLIE WILDE,"Wrought was she of a painter's dream,--"
4367,ORLIE WILDE,"Wise only as are artists wise,"
4368,ORLIE WILDE,"My artist-friend, Rolf Herschkelhiem,"
4369,ORLIE WILDE,"With deep sad eyes of oversize,"
4370,ORLIE WILDE,And face of melancholy guise.
4371,ORLIE WILDE,
4372,ORLIE WILDE,I pressed him that he tell to me
4373,ORLIE WILDE,This masterpiece's history.
4374,ORLIE WILDE,He turned--REturned--and thus beguiled
4375,ORLIE WILDE,Me with the tale of Orlie Wilde:--
4376,ORLIE WILDE,
4377,ORLIE WILDE,"""We artists live ideally:"
4378,ORLIE WILDE,We breed our firmest facts of air;
4379,ORLIE WILDE,We make our own reality--
4380,ORLIE WILDE,We dream a thing and it is so.
4381,ORLIE WILDE,The fairest scenes we ever see
4382,ORLIE WILDE,Are mirages of memory;
4383,ORLIE WILDE,The sweetest thoughts we ever know
4384,ORLIE WILDE,We plagiarize from Long Ago:
4385,ORLIE WILDE,And as the girl on canvas there
4386,ORLIE WILDE,"Is marvelously rare and fair,"
4387,ORLIE WILDE,'Tis only inasmuch as she
4388,ORLIE WILDE,"Is dumb and may not speak to me!"""
4389,ORLIE WILDE,He tapped me with his mahlstick--then
4390,ORLIE WILDE,"The picture,--and went on again:"
4391,ORLIE WILDE,
4392,ORLIE WILDE,"""Orlie Wilde, the fisher's child--"
4393,ORLIE WILDE,"I see her yet, as fair and mild"
4394,ORLIE WILDE,As ever nursling summer day
4395,ORLIE WILDE,Dreamed on the bosom of the bay:
4396,ORLIE WILDE,"For I was twenty then, and went"
4397,ORLIE WILDE,Alone and long-haired--all content
4398,ORLIE WILDE,With promises of sounding name
4399,ORLIE WILDE,"And fantasies of future fame,"
4400,ORLIE WILDE,And thoughts that now my mind discards
4401,ORLIE WILDE,As editor a fledgling bard's.
4402,ORLIE WILDE,
4403,ORLIE WILDE,"""At evening once I chanced to go,"
4404,ORLIE WILDE,"With pencil and portfolio,"
4405,ORLIE WILDE,Adown the street of silver sand
4406,ORLIE WILDE,"That winds beneath this craggy land,"
4407,ORLIE WILDE,To make a sketch of some old scurf
4408,ORLIE WILDE,"Of driftage, nosing through the surf"
4409,ORLIE WILDE,"A splintered mast, with knarl and strand"
4410,ORLIE WILDE,Of rigging-rope and tattered threads
4411,ORLIE WILDE,Of flag and streamer and of sail
4412,ORLIE WILDE,That fluttered idly in the gale
4413,ORLIE WILDE,Or whipped themselves to sadder shreds.
4414,ORLIE WILDE,"The while I wrought, half listlessly,"
4415,ORLIE WILDE,"On my dismantled subject, came"
4416,ORLIE WILDE,"A sea-bird, settling on the same"
4417,ORLIE WILDE,"With plaintive moan, as though that he"
4418,ORLIE WILDE,Had lost his mate upon the sea;
4419,ORLIE WILDE,And--with my melancholy trend--
4420,ORLIE WILDE,It brought dim dreams half understood--
4421,ORLIE WILDE,"It wrought upon my morbid mood,--"
4422,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of my own voyagings
4423,ORLIE WILDE,That had no end--that have no end.--
4424,ORLIE WILDE,"And, like the sea-bird, I made moan"
4425,ORLIE WILDE,That I was loveless and alone.
4426,ORLIE WILDE,And when at last with weary wings
4427,ORLIE WILDE,"It went upon its wanderings,"
4428,ORLIE WILDE,With upturned face I watched its flight
4429,ORLIE WILDE,Until this picture met my sight:
4430,ORLIE WILDE,"A goddess, with a siren's grace,--"
4431,ORLIE WILDE,A sun-haired girl on a craggy place
4432,ORLIE WILDE,Above a bay where fish-boats lay
4433,ORLIE WILDE,Drifting about like birds of prey.
4434,ORLIE WILDE,
4435,ORLIE WILDE,"""In airy poise she, gazing, stood"
4436,ORLIE WILDE,"A machless form of womanhood,"
4437,ORLIE WILDE,That brought a thought that if for me
4438,ORLIE WILDE,"Such eyes had sought across the sea,"
4439,ORLIE WILDE,I could have swum the widest tide
4440,ORLIE WILDE,"That ever mariner defied,"
4441,ORLIE WILDE,"And, at the shore, could on have gone"
4442,ORLIE WILDE,"To that high crag she stood upon,"
4443,ORLIE WILDE,"To there entreat and say, 'My Sweet,"
4444,ORLIE WILDE,Behold thy servant at thy feet.'
4445,ORLIE WILDE,"And to my soul I said:  'Above,"
4446,ORLIE WILDE,There stands the idol of thy love!'
4447,ORLIE WILDE,
4448,ORLIE WILDE,"""In this rapt, awed, ecstatic state"
4449,ORLIE WILDE,I gazed--till lo! I was aware
4450,ORLIE WILDE,A fisherman had joined her there--
4451,ORLIE WILDE,"A weary man, with halting gait,"
4452,ORLIE WILDE,Who toiled beneath a basket's weight:
4453,ORLIE WILDE,"Her father, as I guessed, for she"
4454,ORLIE WILDE,Had run to meet him gleefully
4455,ORLIE WILDE,"And ta'en his burden to herself,"
4456,ORLIE WILDE,That perched upon her shoulder's shelf
4457,ORLIE WILDE,"So lightly that she, tripping, neared"
4458,ORLIE WILDE,A jutting crag and disappeared;
4459,ORLIE WILDE,But she left the echo of a song
4460,ORLIE WILDE,"That thrills me yet, and will as long"
4461,ORLIE WILDE,As I have being! . . .
4462,ORLIE WILDE,
4463,ORLIE WILDE,
4464,ORLIE WILDE,". . . ""Evenings came"
4465,ORLIE WILDE,"And went,--but each the same--the same:"
4466,ORLIE WILDE,"She watched above, and even so"
4467,ORLIE WILDE,I stood there watching from below;
4468,ORLIE WILDE,"Till, grown so bold at last, I sung,--"
4469,ORLIE WILDE,(What matter now the theme thereof!)--
4470,ORLIE WILDE,It brought an answer from her tongue--
4471,ORLIE WILDE,"Faint as the murmur of a dove,"
4472,ORLIE WILDE,Yet all the more the song of love. . . .
4473,ORLIE WILDE,
4474,ORLIE WILDE,"""I turned and looked upon the bay,"
4475,ORLIE WILDE,With palm to forehead--eyes a-blur
4476,ORLIE WILDE,In the sea's smile--meant but for her!--
4477,ORLIE WILDE,I saw the fish-boats far away
4478,ORLIE WILDE,"In misty distance, lightly drawn"
4479,ORLIE WILDE,In chalk-dots on the horizon--
4480,ORLIE WILDE,"Looked back at her, long, wistfully;--"
4481,ORLIE WILDE,"And, pushing off an empty skiff,"
4482,ORLIE WILDE,I beckoned her to quit the cliff
4483,ORLIE WILDE,And yield me her rare company
4484,ORLIE WILDE,Upon a little pleasure-cruise.--
4485,ORLIE WILDE,"She stood, as loathful to refuse,"
4486,ORLIE WILDE,"To muse for full a moment's time,--"
4487,ORLIE WILDE,Then answered back in pantomime
4488,ORLIE WILDE,'She feared some danger from the sea
4489,ORLIE WILDE,Were she discovered thus with me.'
4490,ORLIE WILDE,I motioned then to ask her if
4491,ORLIE WILDE,I might not join her on the cliff
4492,ORLIE WILDE,"And back again, with graceful wave"
4493,ORLIE WILDE,"Of lifted arm, she answer gave"
4494,ORLIE WILDE,'She feared some danger from the sea.'
4495,ORLIE WILDE,
4496,ORLIE WILDE,"""Impatient, piqued, impetuous, I"
4497,ORLIE WILDE,"Sprang in the boat, and flung 'Good-by'"
4498,ORLIE WILDE,"From pouted mouth with angry hand,"
4499,ORLIE WILDE,And madly pulled away from land
4500,ORLIE WILDE,"With lusty stroke, despite that she"
4501,ORLIE WILDE,Held out her hands entreatingly:
4502,ORLIE WILDE,"And when far out, with covert eye"
4503,ORLIE WILDE,"I shoreward glanced, I saw her fly"
4504,ORLIE WILDE,"In reckless haste adown the crag,"
4505,ORLIE WILDE,Her hair a-flutter like a flag
4506,ORLIE WILDE,Of gold that danced across the strand
4507,ORLIE WILDE,In little mists of silver sand.
4508,ORLIE WILDE,"All curious I, pausing, tried"
4509,ORLIE WILDE,"To fancy what it all implied,--"
4510,ORLIE WILDE,When suddenly I found my feet
4511,ORLIE WILDE,"Were wet; and, underneath the seat"
4512,ORLIE WILDE,"On which I sat, I heard the sound"
4513,ORLIE WILDE,"Of gurgling waters, and I found"
4514,ORLIE WILDE,The boat aleak alarmingly. . . .
4515,ORLIE WILDE,"I turned and looked upon the sea,"
4516,ORLIE WILDE,Whose every wave seemed mocking me;
4517,ORLIE WILDE,I saw the fishers' sails once more--
4518,ORLIE WILDE,In dimmer distance than before;
4519,ORLIE WILDE,"I saw the sea-bird wheeling by,"
4520,ORLIE WILDE,With foolish wish that _I_ could fly:
4521,ORLIE WILDE,"I thought of firm earth, home and friends--"
4522,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of everything that tends
4523,ORLIE WILDE,To drive a man to frenzy and
4524,ORLIE WILDE,To wholly lose his own command;
4525,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of all my waywardness--
4526,ORLIE WILDE,Thought of a mother's deep distress;
4527,ORLIE WILDE,Of youthful follies yet unpurged--
4528,ORLIE WILDE,"Sins, as the seas, about me surged--"
4529,ORLIE WILDE,Thought of the printer's ready pen
4530,ORLIE WILDE,To-morrow drowning me again;--
4531,ORLIE WILDE,A million things without a name--
4532,ORLIE WILDE,I thought of everything but--Fame. . . .
4533,ORLIE WILDE,
4534,ORLIE WILDE,"""A memory yet is in my mind,"
4535,ORLIE WILDE,"So keenly clear and sharp-defined,"
4536,ORLIE WILDE,I picture every phase and line
4537,ORLIE WILDE,"Of life and death, and neither mine,--"
4538,ORLIE WILDE,"While some fair seraph, golden-haired,"
4539,ORLIE WILDE,"Bends over me,--with white arms bared,"
4540,ORLIE WILDE,That strongly plait themselves about
4541,ORLIE WILDE,My drowning weight and lift me out--
4542,ORLIE WILDE,With joy too great for words to state
4543,ORLIE WILDE,Or tongue to dare articulate!
4544,ORLIE WILDE,
4545,ORLIE WILDE,"""And this seraphic ocean-child"
4546,ORLIE WILDE,And heroine was Orlie Wilde:
4547,ORLIE WILDE,And thus it was I came to hear
4548,ORLIE WILDE,Her voice's music in my ear--
4549,ORLIE WILDE,"Ay, thus it was Fate paved the way"
4550,ORLIE WILDE,"That I walk desolate to-day!"" . . ."
4551,ORLIE WILDE,
4552,ORLIE WILDE,The artist paused and bowed his face
4553,ORLIE WILDE,"Within his palms a little space,"
4554,ORLIE WILDE,While reverently on his form
4555,ORLIE WILDE,I bent my gaze and marked a storm
4556,ORLIE WILDE,That shook his frame as wrathfully
4557,ORLIE WILDE,"As some typhoon of agony,"
4558,ORLIE WILDE,And fraught with sobs--the more profound
4559,ORLIE WILDE,For that peculiar laughing sound
4560,ORLIE WILDE,We hear when strong men weep. . . .  I leant
4561,ORLIE WILDE,With warmest sympathy--I bent
4562,ORLIE WILDE,"To stroke with soothing hand his brow,"
4563,ORLIE WILDE,"He murmuring--""Tis over now!--"
4564,ORLIE WILDE,
4565,ORLIE WILDE,And shall I tie the silken thread
4566,ORLIE WILDE,"Of my frail romance?""  ""Yes,"" I said.--"
4567,ORLIE WILDE,"He faintly smiled; and then, with brow"
4568,ORLIE WILDE,"In kneading palm, as one in dread--"
4569,ORLIE WILDE,His tasseled cap pushed from his head
4570,ORLIE WILDE,""" 'Her voice's music,' I repeat,"""
4571,ORLIE WILDE,"He said,--"" 'twas sweet--O passing sweet!--"
4572,ORLIE WILDE,"Though she herself, in uttering"
4573,ORLIE WILDE,"Its melody, proved not the thing"
4574,ORLIE WILDE,Of loveliness my dreams made meet
4575,ORLIE WILDE,"For me--there, yearning, at her feet--"
4576,ORLIE WILDE,"Prone at her feet--a worshiper,--"
4577,ORLIE WILDE,"For lo! she spake a tongue,"" moaned he,"
4578,ORLIE WILDE,"""Unknown to me;--unknown to me"
4579,ORLIE WILDE,"As mine to her--as mine to her."""

4705,DEAD SELVES,"With rockers on, is blanketed"
4706,DEAD SELVES,And sleeping in the long ago;

4708,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?
4709,DEAD SELVES,
4710,DEAD SELVES,A little face with drowsy eyes
4711,DEAD SELVES,And lisping lips comes mistily
4712,DEAD SELVES,"From out the faded past, and tries"
4713,DEAD SELVES,The prayers a mother breathed with sighs
4714,DEAD SELVES,Of anxious care in teaching me;

4716,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?

4718,DEAD SELVES,The little naked feet that slipped
4719,DEAD SELVES,"In truant paths, and led the way"

4727,DEAD SELVES,"Inditing letters filled with love,"
4728,DEAD SELVES,"Who was compelled, for all he fought,"
4729,DEAD SELVES,To read aloud each tender thought
4730,DEAD SELVES,"Of ""Sugar Lump"" and ""Turtle Dove."""
4731,DEAD SELVES,I wonder where he hides his head--
4732,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?
4733,DEAD SELVES,
4734,DEAD SELVES,The earnest features of a youth
4735,DEAD SELVES,"With manly fringe on lip and chin,"
4736,DEAD SELVES,"With eager tongue to tell the truth,"
4737,DEAD SELVES,"To offer love and life, forsooth,"
4738,DEAD SELVES,So brave was he to woo and win;
4739,DEAD SELVES,A prouder man was never wed--
4740,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?
4741,DEAD SELVES,
4742,DEAD SELVES,"The great, strong hands so all-inclined"
4743,DEAD SELVES,"To welcome toil, or smooth the care"
4744,DEAD SELVES,"From mother-brows, or quick to find"
4745,DEAD SELVES,"A leisure-scrap of any kind,"
4746,DEAD SELVES,"To toss the baby in the air,"
4747,DEAD SELVES,Or clap at babbling things it said--
4748,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?
4749,DEAD SELVES,
4750,DEAD SELVES,The pact of brawn and scheming brain--
4751,DEAD SELVES,"Conspiring in the plots of wealth,"
4752,DEAD SELVES,"Still delving, till the lengthened chain,"
4753,DEAD SELVES,"Unwindlassed in the mines of gain,"
4754,DEAD SELVES,Recoils with dregs of ruined health
4755,DEAD SELVES,And pain and poverty instead--
4756,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?

4758,DEAD SELVES,"The faltering step, the faded hair--"
4759,DEAD SELVES,"Head, heart and soul, all echoing"
4760,DEAD SELVES,With maundering fancies that declare
4761,DEAD SELVES,"That life and love were never there,"
4762,DEAD SELVES,"Nor ever joy in anything,"
4763,DEAD SELVES,Nor wounded heart that ever bled--
4764,DEAD SELVES,How many of my selves are dead?
4765,DEAD SELVES,
4766,DEAD SELVES,"So many of my selves are dead,"
4767,DEAD SELVES,"That, bending here above the brink"
4768,DEAD SELVES,"Of my last grave, with dizzy head,"
4769,DEAD SELVES,"I find my spirit comforted,"
4770,DEAD SELVES,For all the idle things I think:
4771,DEAD SELVES,"It can but be a peaceful bed,"
4772,DEAD SELVES,Since all my other selves are dead.

4776,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4777,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Lying listless in the mosses
4778,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Underneath a tree that tosses
4779,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Flakes of sunshine, and embosses"
4780,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Its green shadow with the snow--
4781,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Drowsy-eyed, I sink in slumber"
4782,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Born of fancies without number--

4785,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4786,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Ripples of the river singing;
4787,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,And the water-lilies swinging
4788,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Bells of Parian, and ringing"
4789,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Peals of perfume faint and fine,"
4790,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,While old forms and fairy faces
4791,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Leap from out their hiding-places
4792,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"In the past, with glad embraces"
4793,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Fraught with kisses sweet as wine.
4794,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4795,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Willows dip their slender fingers
4796,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"O'er the little fisher's stringers,"
4797,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,While he baits his hook and lingers
4798,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Till the shadows gather dim;
4799,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,And afar off comes a calling
4800,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Like the sounds of water falling,"
4801,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,With the lazy echoes drawling
4802,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Messages of haste to him.
4803,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4804,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Little naked feet that tinkle
4805,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Through the stubble-fields, and twinkle"
4806,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Down the winding road, and sprinkle"
4807,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Little mists of dusty rain,"
4808,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,While in pasture-lands the cattle
4809,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Cease their grazing with a rattle
4810,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Of the bells whose clappers tattle
4811,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,To their masters down the lane.
4812,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4813,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Trees that hold their tempting treasures
4814,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"O'er the orchard's hedge embrasures,"
4815,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Furnish their forbidden pleasures
4816,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,As in Eden lands of old;
4817,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,And the coming of the master
4818,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Indicates a like disaster
4819,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,To the frightened heart that faster
4820,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Beats pulsations manifold.
4821,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4822,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Puckered lips whose pipings tingle
4823,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,In staccato notes that mingle
4824,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Musically with the jingle-
4825,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Haunted winds that lightly fan
4826,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"Mellow twilights, crimson-tinted"
4827,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"By the sun, and picture-printed"
4828,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Like a book that sweetly hinted
4829,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Of the Nights Arabian.
4830,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4831,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Porticoes with columns plaited
4832,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,And entwined with vines and freighted
4833,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,With a bloom all radiated
4834,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,With the light of moon and star;
4835,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Where some tender voice is winging
4836,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"In sad flights of song, and singing"
4837,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,To the dancing fingers flinging
4838,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Dripping from the sweet guitar.
4839,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,
4840,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Would my dreams were never taken
4841,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,From me: that with faith unshaken
4842,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,I might sleep and never waken
4843,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,On a weary world of woe!
4844,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Links of love would never sever
4845,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,"As I dreamed them, never, never!"
4846,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,I would glide along forever
4847,A DREAM OF LONG AGO,Through the dreams of long ago.

4860,CRAQUEODOOM,
4861,CRAQUEODOOM,"The Gool closed his ear on the voice of the Grig,"

4865,CRAQUEODOOM,And the air it grew chill as the Gryxabodill
4866,CRAQUEODOOM,"Raised his dank, dripping fins to the skies,"
4867,CRAQUEODOOM,And plead with the Plunk for the use of her bill
4868,CRAQUEODOOM,To pick the tears out of his eyes.
4869,CRAQUEODOOM,
4870,CRAQUEODOOM,"The ghost of the Zhack flitted by in a trance,"

4872,CRAQUEODOOM,As he heard the loud hooves of the Hooken advance
4873,CRAQUEODOOM,With a rub-a-dub--dub-a-dub--dub!
4874,CRAQUEODOOM,"And the Crankadox cried, as he lay down and died,"

4886,JUNE,The lazy hours away.  The zephyr throws
4887,JUNE,The shifting shuttle of the Summer's loom
4888,JUNE,And weaves a damask-work of gleam and gloom
4889,JUNE,Before thy listless feet.  The lily blows
4890,JUNE,A bugle-call of fragrance o'er the glade;

4939,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,Er idle a single day.
4940,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,But shucks!  It made him worse and worse
4941,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"A-writin' rhymes and stuff,"
4942,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,And the school committee used to furse
4943,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,'At the school warn't good enough.

4945,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"He warn't as strict as he ought to been,"

4958,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"Fer I remember, he turned so white,"

4960,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"I someway felt it wasn't right,"
4961,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,And I'm shore it wasn't now!
4962,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,
4963,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,He hadn't no complaints at all--
4964,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"He bid the school adieu,"

4966,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,Was mighty sorry too!
4967,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,And when he closed that afternoon
4968,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,They sung some lines that he

4970,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"That suited the case, you see."
4971,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,

4986,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,"So lonesome-like and low,"

4989,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,
4990,WASH LOWRY'S REMINISCENCE,And when at last he tuck to bed

5187,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"A weak and sinful creature, as regards my daily walk"
5188,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,The last five years and better.  It ain't worth while to talk--
5189,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5190,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I've been too mean to tell it!  I've been so hard, you see,"
5191,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And full of pride, and--onry--now there's the word for me--"
5192,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Just onry--and to show you, I'll give my history"
5193,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"With vital points in question, and I think you'll all agree."
5194,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5195,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I was always stiff and stubborn since I could recollect,"
5196,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And had an awful temper, and never would reflect;"
5197,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And always into trouble--I remember once at school
5198,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"The teacher tried to flog me, and I reversed that rule."
5199,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5200,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,O I was bad I tell you!  And it's a funny move
5201,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That a fellow wild as I was could ever fall in love;
5202,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And it's a funny notion that an animal like me,"
5203,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Under a girl's weak fingers was as tame as tame could be!
5204,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5205,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"But it's so, and sets me thinking of the easy way she had"
5206,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Of cooling down my temper--though I'd be fighting mad.
5207,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"""My Lion Queen"" I called her--when a spell of mine occurred"
5208,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,She'd come in a den of feelings and quell them with a word.
5209,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5210,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I'll tell you how she loved me--and what her people thought:
5211,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"When I asked to marry Annie they said ""they reckoned not--"
5212,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That I cut too many didoes and monkey-shines to suit
5213,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Their idea of a son-in-law, and I could go, to boot!"""
5214,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5215,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I tell you that thing riled me!  Why, I felt my face turn white,"
5216,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And my teeth shut like a steel trap, and the fingers of my right"
5217,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Hand pained me with their pressure--all the rest's a mystery
5218,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Till I heard my Annie saying--""I'm going, too, you see."""
5219,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5220,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"We were coming through the gateway, and she wavered for a spell"
5221,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,When she heard her mother crying and her raving father yell
5222,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That she wa'n't no child of his'n--like an actor in a play
5223,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"We saw at Independence, coming through the other day."
5224,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5225,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Well! that's the way we started.  And for days and weeks and
5226,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,months
5227,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And even years we journeyed on, regretting never once"
5228,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Of starting out together upon the path of life--
5229,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Akind o' sort o' husband, but a mighty loving wife,--"
5230,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5231,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And the cutest little baby--little Grace--I see her now
5232,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,A-standin' on the pig-pen as her mother milked the cow--
5233,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And I can hear her shouting--as I stood unloading straw,--"
5234,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"""I'm ain't as big as papa, but I'm biggerest'n ma."""
5235,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5236,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Now folks that never married don't seem to understand
5237,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That a little baby's language is the sweetest ever planned--
5238,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Why, I tell you it's pure music, and I'll just go on to say"
5239,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That I sometimes have a notion that the angels talk that way!
5240,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5241,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,There's a chapter in this story I'd be happy to destroy;
5242,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I could burn it up before you with a mighty sight of joy;
5243,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"But I'll go ahead and give it--not in detail, no, my friend,"
5244,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,For it takes five years of reading before you find the end.
5245,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5246,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"My Annie's folks relented--at least, in some degree;"
5247,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"They sent one time for Annie, but they didn't send for me."
5248,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,The old man wrote the message with a heart as hot and dry
5249,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"As a furnace--""Annie Mullen, come and see your mother die."""
5250,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5251,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I saw the slur intended--why I fancied I could see
5252,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,The old man shoot the insult like a poison dart at me;
5253,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And in that heat of passion I swore an inward oath
5254,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That if Annie pleased her father she could never please us both.
5255,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5256,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I watched her--dark and sullen--as she hurried on her shawl;
5257,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I watched her--calm and cruel, though I saw her tear-drops fall;"
5258,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I watched her--cold and heartless, though I heard her moaning,"
5259,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,call
5260,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,For mercy from high Heaven--and I smiled throughout it all.
5261,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5262,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Why even when she kissed me, and her tears were on my brow,"
5263,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"As she murmured, ""George, forgive me--I must go to mother now!"""
5264,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Such hate there was within me that I answered not at all,"
5265,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"But calm, and cold and cruel, I smiled throughout it all."
5266,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5267,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"But a shadow in the doorway caught my eye, and then the face"
5268,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Full of innocence and sunshine of little baby Grace.
5269,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And I snatched her up and kissed her, and I softened through and"
5270,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,through
5271,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"For a minute when she told me ""I must kiss her muvver too."""
5272,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5273,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I remember, at the starting, how I tried to freeze again"
5274,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,As I watched them slowly driving down the little crooked lane--
5275,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"When Annie shouted something that ended in a cry,"
5276,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And how I tried to whistle and it fizzled in a sigh.
5277,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5278,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I remember running after, with a glimmer in my sight--"
5279,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Pretending I'd discovered that the traces wasn't right;
5280,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And the last that I remember, as they disappeared from view,"
5281,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Was little Grace a-calling, ""I see papa!  Howdy-do!"""
5282,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5283,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And left alone to ponder, I again took up my hate"
5284,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,For the old man who would chuckle that I was desolate;
5285,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And I mouthed my wrongs in mutters till my pride called up the
5286,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,pain
5287,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,His last insult had given me--until I smiled again
5288,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5289,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Till the wild beast in my nature was raging in the den--
5290,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"With no one now to quell it, and I wrote a letter then"
5291,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Full of hissing things, and heated with so hot a heat of hate"
5292,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,That my pen flashed out black lightning at a most terrific rate.
5293,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5294,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I wrote that ""she had wronged me when she went away from me--"
5295,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Though to see her dying mother 'twas her father's victory,"
5296,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And a woman that could waver when her husband's pride was rent
5297,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Was no longer worthy of it.""  And I shut the house and went."
5298,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5299,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,To tell of my long exile would be of little good--
5300,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Though I couldn't half-way tell it, and I wouldn't if I could!"
5301,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I could tell of California--of a wild and vicious life;
5302,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"Of trackless plains, and mountains, and the Indian's"
5303,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,scalping-knife.
5304,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5305,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I could tell of gloomy forests howling wild with threats of
5306,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,death;
5307,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I could tell of fiery deserts that have scorched me with their
5308,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,breath;
5309,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I could tell of wretched outcasts by the hundreds, great and"
5310,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"small,"
5311,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And could claim the nasty honor of the greatest of them all.
5312,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5313,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I could tell of toil and hardship; and of sickness and disease,"
5314,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And hollow-eyed starvation, but I tell you, friend, that these"
5315,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Are trifles in comparison with what a fellow feels
5316,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"With that bloodhound, Remorsefulness, forever at his heels."
5317,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5318,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I remember--worn and weary of the long, long years of care,"
5319,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,When the frost of time was making early harvest of my hair--
5320,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I remember, wrecked and hopeless of a rest beneath the sky,"
5321,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"My resolve to quit the country, and to seek the East, and die."
5322,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5323,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"I remember my long journey, like a dull, oppressive dream,"
5324,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Across the empty prairies till I caught the distant gleam
5325,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Of a city in the beauty of its broad and shining stream
5326,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"On whose bosom, flocked together, float the mighty swans of"
5327,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,steam.
5328,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5329,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I remember drifting with them till I found myself again
5330,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,In the rush and roar and rattle of the engine and the train;
5331,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"And when from my surroundings something spoke of child and wife,"
5332,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,It seemed the train was rumbling through a tunnel in my life.
5333,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5334,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,Then I remember something--like a sudden burst of light--
5335,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"That don't exactly tell it, but I couldn't tell it right--"
5336,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,A something clinging to me with its arms around my neck--
5337,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"A little girl, for instance--or an angel, I expect--"
5338,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5339,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"For she kissed me, cried and called me ""her dear papa,"" and I"
5340,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,felt
5341,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"My heart was pure virgin gold, and just about to melt--"
5342,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,And so it did--it melted in a mist of gleaming rain
5343,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"When she took my hand and whispered, ""My mama's on the train."""
5344,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,
5345,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"There's some things I can dwell on, and get off pretty well,"
5346,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,But the balance of this story I know I couldn't tell;
5347,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,"So I ain't going to try it, for to tell the reason why--"
5348,GEORGE MULLEN'S CONFESSION,I'm so chicken-hearted lately I'd be certain 'most to cry.

5675,WHAT THE WIND SAID,"Where the eagle shrieks and cries,"

5792,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,All of earthly eloquence
5793,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"Fails, and falls, and swoons away"
5794,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,In your presence.  Like as one

5796,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"Fairly in the face, I say,"
5797,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Though my eyes you dazzle blind
5798,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Greater dazzled is my mind.
5799,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"So, my Autumn, let me kneel"
5800,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,At your feet and worship you!
5801,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Be my sweetheart; let me feel
5802,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Your caress; and tell me too
5803,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Why your smiles bewilder me--
5804,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"Glancing into laughter, then"
5805,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"Trancing into calm again,"
5806,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Till your meaning drowning lies
5807,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,In the dim depths of your eyes.
5808,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Let me see the things you see
5809,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Down the depths of mystery!
5810,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Blow aside the hazy veil
5811,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,From the daylight of your face
5812,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,With the fragrance-ladened gale
5813,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Of your spicy breath and chase
5814,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Every dimple to its place.
5815,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Lift your gipsy finger-tips
5816,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"To the roses of your lips,"
5817,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,And fling down to me a bud--
5818,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,But an unblown kiss--but one--
5819,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,"It shall blossom in my blood,"
5820,AN AUTUMNAL EXTRAVAGANZA,Even after life is done--

5831,THE ROSE,THE ROSE
5832,THE ROSE,
5833,THE ROSE,It tossed its head at the wooing breeze;
5834,THE ROSE,"And the sun, like a bashful swain,"
5835,THE ROSE,Beamed on it through the waving trees
5836,THE ROSE,"With a passion all in vain,--"
5837,THE ROSE,"For my rose laughed in a crimson glee,"
5838,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
5839,THE ROSE,
5840,THE ROSE,The honey-bee came there to sing
5841,THE ROSE,"His love through the languid hours,"
5842,THE ROSE,"And vaunt of his hives, as a proud old king"
5843,THE ROSE,Might boast of his palace-towers:
5844,THE ROSE,"But my rose bowed in a mockery,"
5845,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
5846,THE ROSE,
5847,THE ROSE,"The humming-bird, like a courtier gay,"
5848,THE ROSE,"Dipped down with a dalliant song,"
5849,THE ROSE,And twanged his wings through the roundelay
5850,THE ROSE,Of love the whole day long:
5851,THE ROSE,Yet my rose turned from his minstrelsy
5852,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
5853,THE ROSE,
5854,THE ROSE,The firefly came in the twilight dim
5855,THE ROSE,"My red, red rose to woo--"
5856,THE ROSE,"Till quenched was the flame of love in him,"
5857,THE ROSE,"And the light of his lantern too,"
5858,THE ROSE,As my rose wept with dewdrops three
5859,THE ROSE,And hid in the leaves in wait for me.
5860,THE ROSE,
5861,THE ROSE,And I said:  I will cull my own sweet rose--
5862,THE ROSE,Some day I will claim as mine
5863,THE ROSE,The priceless worth of the flower that knows
5864,THE ROSE,"No change, but a bloom divine--"
5865,THE ROSE,The bloom of a fadeless constancy
5866,THE ROSE,That hides in the leaves in wait for me!
5867,THE ROSE,
5868,THE ROSE,"But time passed by in a strange disguise,"
5869,THE ROSE,"And I marked it not, but lay"
5870,THE ROSE,"In a lazy dream, with drowsy eyes,"
5871,THE ROSE,"Till the summer slipped away,"
5872,THE ROSE,And a chill wind sang in a minor key:
5873,THE ROSE,"""Where is the rose that waits for thee?"""

5876,THE ROSE,
5877,THE ROSE,"I dream to-day, o'er a purple stain"
5878,THE ROSE,"Of bloom on a withered stalk,"
5879,THE ROSE,Pelted down by the autumn rain
5880,THE ROSE,"In the dust of the garden-walk,"
5881,THE ROSE,That an Angel-rose in the world to be
5882,THE ROSE,Will hide in the leaves in wait for me.

5918,III,Neither moon nor star;
5919,III,We would shriek aloud in the dismal dales--
5920,III,"Shriek at each other and squawk and squeal,"
5921,III,"""All night!"" rakishly, rakishly;"

5929,III,"And skip away when they snatched at me,"
5930,III,"Fiendishly, fiendishly."
5931,III,"O, what a jolly life I'd lead,"
5932,III,"Ah, what a ""bang-up"" life indeed!"
5933,III,Soft are the mermaids under the sea--

6383,YLLADMAR,
6384,YLLADMAR,The crimson fruitage of her lips

6406,A FANTASY,
6407,A FANTASY,A fantasy that came to me
6408,A FANTASY,As wild and wantonly designed
6409,A FANTASY,As ever any dream might be
6410,A FANTASY,"Unraveled from a madman's mind,--"
6411,A FANTASY,"A tangle-work of tissue, wrought"
6412,A FANTASY,"By cunning of the spider-brain,"
6413,A FANTASY,"And woven, in an hour of pain,"
6414,A FANTASY,To trap the giddy flies of thought.
6415,A FANTASY,
6416,A FANTASY,I stood beneath a summer moon
6417,A FANTASY,"All swollen to uncanny girth,"
6418,A FANTASY,"And hanging, like the sun at noon,"
6419,A FANTASY,Above the center of the earth;
6420,A FANTASY,"But with a sad and sallow light,"
6421,A FANTASY,As it had sickened of the night
6422,A FANTASY,And fallen in a pallid swoon.
6423,A FANTASY,Around me I could hear the rush
6424,A FANTASY,"Of sullen winds, and feel the whir"
6425,A FANTASY,Of unseen wings apast me brush
6426,A FANTASY,Like phantoms round a sepulcher;
6427,A FANTASY,"And, like a carpeting of plush,0"
6428,A FANTASY,"A lawn unrolled beneath my feet,"
6429,A FANTASY,Bespangled o'er with flowers as sweet
6430,A FANTASY,To look upon as those that nod
6431,A FANTASY,"Within the garden-fields of God,"
6432,A FANTASY,But odorless as those that blow
6433,A FANTASY,In ashes in the shades below.
6434,A FANTASY,
6435,A FANTASY,And on my hearing fell a storm
6436,A FANTASY,"Of gusty music, sadder yet"
6437,A FANTASY,Than every whimper of regret
6438,A FANTASY,"That sobbing utterance could form,"
6439,A FANTASY,And patched with scraps of sound that seemed
6440,A FANTASY,"Torn out of tunes that demons dreamed,"
6441,A FANTASY,"And pitched to such a piercing key,"
6442,A FANTASY,It stabbed the ear with agony;
6443,A FANTASY,"And when at last it lulled and died,"
6444,A FANTASY,I stood aghast and terrified.
6445,A FANTASY,"I shuddered and I shut my eyes,"
6446,A FANTASY,"And still could see, and feel aware"
6447,A FANTASY,Some mystic presence waited there;
6448,A FANTASY,"And staring, with a dazed surprise,"
6449,A FANTASY,I saw a creature so divine
6450,A FANTASY,That never subtle thought of mine
6451,A FANTASY,May reproduce to inner sight
6452,A FANTASY,So fair a vision of delight.
6453,A FANTASY,
6454,A FANTASY,A syllable of dew that drips
6455,A FANTASY,From out a lily's laughing lips
6456,A FANTASY,Could not be sweeter than the word
6457,A FANTASY,"I listened to, yet never heard.--"
6458,A FANTASY,"For, oh, the woman hiding there"
6459,A FANTASY,"Within the shadows of her hair,"
6460,A FANTASY,Spake to me in an undertone
6461,A FANTASY,"So delicate, my soul alone"
6462,A FANTASY,But understood it as a moan
6463,A FANTASY,Of some weak melody of wind
6464,A FANTASY,A heavenward breeze had left behind.
6465,A FANTASY,
6466,A FANTASY,"A tracery of trees, grotesque"
6467,A FANTASY,"Against the sky, behind her seen,"
6468,A FANTASY,Like shapeless shapes of arabesque
6469,A FANTASY,Wrought in an Oriental screen;
6470,A FANTASY,"And tall, austere and statuesque"
6471,A FANTASY,She loomed before it--e'en as though
6472,A FANTASY,The spirit-hand of Angelo
6473,A FANTASY,"Had chiseled her to life complete,"
6474,A FANTASY,With chips of moonshine round her feet.
6475,A FANTASY,"And I grew jealous of the dusk,"
6476,A FANTASY,"To see it softly touch her face,"
6477,A FANTASY,"As lover-like, with fond embrace,"
6478,A FANTASY,It folded round her like a husk:
6479,A FANTASY,"But when the glitter of her hand,"
6480,A FANTASY,"Like wasted glory, beckoned me,"
6481,A FANTASY,My eyes grew blurred and dull and dim--
6482,A FANTASY,My vision failed--I could not see--
6483,A FANTASY,"I could not stir--I could but stand,"
6484,A FANTASY,"Till, quivering in every limb,"
6485,A FANTASY,"I flung me prone, as though to swim"
6486,A FANTASY,The tide of grass whose waves of green
6487,A FANTASY,Went rolling ocean-wide between
6488,A FANTASY,My helpless shipwrecked heart and her
6489,A FANTASY,Who claimed me for a worshiper.
6490,A FANTASY,
6491,A FANTASY,"And writhing thus in my despair,"
6492,A FANTASY,"I heard a weird, unearthly sound,"
6493,A FANTASY,That seemed to lift me from the ground
6494,A FANTASY,And hold me floating in the air.
6495,A FANTASY,"I looked, and lo!  I saw her bow"
6496,A FANTASY,Above a harp within her hands;
6497,A FANTASY,"A crown of blossoms bound her brow,"
6498,A FANTASY,And on her harp were twisted strands
6499,A FANTASY,"Of silken starlight, rippling o'er"
6500,A FANTASY,With music never heard before
6501,A FANTASY,"By mortal ears; and, at the strain,"
6502,A FANTASY,I felt my Spirit snap its chain
6503,A FANTASY,"And break away,--and I could see"
6504,A FANTASY,It as it turned and fled from me
6505,A FANTASY,"To greet its mistress, where she smiled"
6506,A FANTASY,To see the phantom dancing wild
6507,A FANTASY,And wizard-like before the spell
6508,A FANTASY,Her mystic fingers knew so well.

6513,A DREAM,I dreamed I was a spider;
6514,A DREAM,"A big, fat, hungry spider;"
6515,A DREAM,"A lusty, rusty spider"
6516,A DREAM,With a dozen palsied limbs;
6517,A DREAM,With a dozen limbs that dangled
6518,A DREAM,Where three wretched flies were tangled
6519,A DREAM,And their buzzing wings were strangled
6520,A DREAM,In the middle of their hymns.
6521,A DREAM,
6522,A DREAM,And I mocked them like a demon--
6523,A DREAM,A demoniacal demon
6524,A DREAM,Who delights to be a demon
6525,A DREAM,For the sake of sin alone;
6526,A DREAM,And with fondly false embraces
6527,A DREAM,Did I weave my mystic laces
6528,A DREAM,Round their horror-stricken faces
6529,A DREAM,Till I muffled every groan.
6530,A DREAM,
6531,A DREAM,"And I smiled to see them weeping,"
6532,A DREAM,"For to see an insect weeping,"
6533,A DREAM,"Sadly, sorrowfully weeping,"
6534,A DREAM,Fattens every spider's mirth;
6535,A DREAM,"And to note a fly's heart quaking,"
6536,A DREAM,And with anguish ever aching
6537,A DREAM,Till you see it slowly breaking
6538,A DREAM,Is the sweetest thing on earth.
6539,A DREAM,
6540,A DREAM,"I experienced a pleasure,"
6541,A DREAM,"Such a highly-flavored pleasure,"
6542,A DREAM,"Such intoxicating pleasure,"
6543,A DREAM,That I drank of it like wine;
6544,A DREAM,And my mortal soul engages
6545,A DREAM,That no spider on the pages
6546,A DREAM,Of the history of ages
6547,A DREAM,Felt a rapture more divine.
6548,A DREAM,
6549,A DREAM,I careened around and capered--
6550,A DREAM,"Madly, mystically capered--"
6551,A DREAM,For three days and nights I capered
6552,A DREAM,Round my web in wild delight;
6553,A DREAM,"Till with fierce ambition burning,"
6554,A DREAM,And an inward thirst and yearning
6555,A DREAM,I hastened my returning
6556,A DREAM,With a fiendish appetite.
6557,A DREAM,
6558,A DREAM,"And I found my victims dying,"
6559,A DREAM,"""Ha!"" they whispered, ""we are dying!"""
6560,A DREAM,"Faintly whispered, ""we are dying,"
6561,A DREAM,"And our earthly course is run."""
6562,A DREAM,And the scene was so impressing
6563,A DREAM,"That I breathed a special blessing,"
6564,A DREAM,As I killed them with caressing
6565,A DREAM,And devoured them one by one.

6695,II,To stay the strength of the stranger's toil.
6696,II,

6701,II,When the trembling hands upraised in prayer

6703,II,
6704,II,Days when the voice of hope had fled--
6705,II,Days when the eyes grown weak
6706,II,"Were folded to, and the tears they shed"
6707,II,Were frost on a frozen cheek--
6708,II,When the storm bent down from the skies and gave

6710,II,
6711,II,Days at last when the smiling sun

6766,III,Taught every lisping breeze a melody.
6767,III,"A nest of cabins, where the smoke upcurled"
6768,III,A breathing incense to the other world.
6769,III,"A land of languor from the sun of noon,"
6770,III,"That fainted slowly to the pallid moon,"
6771,III,"Till stars, thick-scattered in the garden-land"
6772,III,"Of Heaven by the great Jehovah's hand,"
6773,III,Had blossomed into light to look upon
6774,III,"The dusky warrior with his arrow drawn,"
6775,III,As skulking from the covert of the night
6776,III,"With serpent cunning and a fiend's delight,"
6777,III,"With murderous spirit, and a yell of hate"
6778,III,The voice of Hell might tremble to translate:
6779,III,When the fond mother's tender lullaby
6780,III,"Went quavering in shrieks all suddenly,"
6781,III,And baby-lips were dabbled with the stain
6782,III,"Of crimson at the bosom of the slain,"
6783,III,And peaceful homes and fortunes ruined--lost
6784,III,In smoldering embers of the holocaust.
6785,III,"Yet on and on, through years of gloom and strife,"
6786,III,Our country struggled into stronger life;
6787,III,"Till colonies, like footprints in the sand,"
6788,III,Marked Freedom's pathway winding through the land--
6789,III,And not the footprints to be swept away
6790,III,"Before the storm we hatched in Boston Bay,--"
6791,III,But footprints where the path of war begun
6792,III,"That led to Bunker Hill and Lexington,--"
6793,III,"For he who ""dared to lead where others dared"
6794,III,"To follow"" found the promise there declared"
6795,III,"Of Liberty, in blood of Freedom's host"
6796,III,"Baptized to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
6797,III,
6798,III,"Oh, there were times when every patriot breast"
6799,III,Was riotous with sentiments expressed
6800,III,In tones that swelled in volume till the sound
6801,III,Of lusty war itself was well-nigh drowned.
6802,III,"Oh, those were times when happy eyes with tears"
6803,III,Brimmed o'er as all the misty doubts and fears
6804,III,"Were washed away, and Hope with gracious mien,"
6805,III,Reigned from her throne again a sovereign queen.
6806,III,"Until at last, upon a day like this"
6807,III,"When flowers were blushing at the summer's kiss,"
6808,III,And when the sky was cloudless as the face
6809,III,"Of some sweet infant in its angel grace,--"
6810,III,"There came a sound of music, thrown afloat"
6811,III,Upon the balmy air--a clanging note
6812,III,Reiterated from the brazen throat
6813,III,"Of Independence Bell:  A sound so sweet,"
6814,III,The clamoring throngs of people in the streets
6815,III,"Were stilled as at the solemn voice of prayer,"
6816,III,"And heads were bowed, and lips were moving there"
6817,III,"That made no sound--until the spell had passed,"
6818,III,"And then, as when all sudden comes the blast"
6819,III,"Of some tornado, came the cheer on cheer"
6820,III,"Of every eager voice, while far and near"
6821,III,The echoing bells upon the atmosphere
6822,III,"Set glorious rumors floating, till the ear"
6823,III,"Of every listening patriot tingled clear,"
6824,III,And thrilled with joy and jubilee to hear.

6866,IV,"A bleeding country ever heard,--"
6867,IV,We lay our hopes upon thy shrine
6868,IV,And offer up our lives for thine.
6869,IV,You gave us many happy years
6870,IV,Of peace and plenty ere the tears
6871,IV,A mourning country wept were dried
6872,IV,Above the graves of those who died
6873,IV,Upon thy threshold.  And again
6874,IV,"When newer wars were bred, and men"
6875,IV,Went marching in the cannon's breath
6876,IV,"And died for thee and loved the death,"
6877,IV,"While, high above them, gleaming bright,"
6878,IV,"The dear old flag remained in sight,"
6879,IV,And lighted up their dying eyes
6880,IV,With smiles that brightened paradise.
6881,IV,"O Liberty, it is thy power"
6882,IV,To gladden us in every hour
6883,IV,"Of gloom, and lead us by thy hand"
6884,IV,As little children through a land
6885,IV,Of bud and blossom; while the days
6886,IV,"Are filled with sunshine, and thy praise"
6887,IV,Is warbled in the roundelays
6888,IV,"Of joyous birds, and in the song"
6889,IV,"Of waters, murmuring along"
6890,IV,"The paths of peace, whose flowery fringe"
6891,IV,Has roses finding deeper tinge
6892,IV,"Of crimson, looking on themselves"
6893,IV,Reflected--leaning from the shelves
6894,IV,Of cliff and crag and mossy mound
6895,IV,Of emerald splendor shadow-drowned.--
6896,IV,"We hail thy presence, as you come"
6897,IV,"With bugle blast and rolling drum,"
6898,IV,And booming guns and shouts of glee
6899,IV,Commingled in a symphony
6900,IV,That thrills the worlds that throng to see
6901,IV,The glory of thy pageantry.
6902,IV,"0And with thy praise, we breathe a prayer"
6903,IV,That God who leaves you in our care
6904,IV,May favor us from this day on
6905,IV,With thy dear presence--till the dawn
6906,IV,"Of Heaven, breaking on thy face,"
6907,IV,Lights up thy first abiding place.
