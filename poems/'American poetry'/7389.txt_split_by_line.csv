53,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,THE PILGRIM'S VISION
54,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
55,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,IN the hour of twilight shadows
56,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The Pilgrim sire looked out;
57,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"He thought of the ""bloudy Salvages"""
58,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"That lurked all round about,"
59,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Of Wituwamet's pictured knife
60,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And Pecksuot's whooping shout;
61,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"For the baby's limbs were feeble,"
62,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Though his father's arms were stout.
63,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
64,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"His home was a freezing cabin,"
65,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Too bare for the hungry rat;
66,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Its roof was thatched with ragged grass,"
67,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And bald enough of that;
68,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The hole that served for casement
69,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Was glazed with an ancient hat,"
70,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And the ice was gently thawing
71,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,From the log whereon he sat.
72,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
73,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Along the dreary landscape
74,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"His eyes went to and fro,"
75,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
76,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The trees all clad in icicles,"
77,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The streams that did not flow;
78,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"A sudden thought flashed o'er him,--"
79,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"A dream of long ago,--"
80,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"He smote his leathern jerkin,"
81,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"And murmured, ""Even so!"""
82,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
83,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""Come hither, God-be-Glorified,"
84,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And sit upon my knee;
85,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Behold the dream unfolding,"
86,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Whereof I spake to thee
87,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,By the winter's hearth in Leyden
88,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And on the stormy sea.
89,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"True is the dream's beginning,--"
90,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,So may its ending be!
91,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
92,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""I saw in the naked forest"
93,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Our scattered remnant cast,"
94,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,A screen of shivering branches
95,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Between them and the blast;
96,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The snow was falling round them,"
97,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The dying fell as fast;
98,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"I looked to see them perish,"
99,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"When lo, the vision passed."
100,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
101,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""Again mine eyes were opened;--"
102,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The feeble had waxed strong,"
103,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The babes had grown to sturdy men,"
104,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The remnant was a throng;
105,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"By shadowed lake and winding stream,"
106,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"And all the shores along,"
107,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The howling demons quaked to hear
108,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The Christian's godly song.
109,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
110,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""They slept, the village fathers,"
111,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"By river, lake, and shore,"
112,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,When far adown the steep of Time
113,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The vision rose once more
114,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,I saw along the winter snow
115,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"A spectral column pour,"
116,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And high above their broken ranks
117,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,A tattered flag they bore.
118,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
119,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""Their Leader rode before them,"
120,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Of bearing calm and high,"
121,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The light of Heaven's own kindling
122,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Throned in his awful eye;
123,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,These were a Nation's champions
124,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Her dread appeal to try.
125,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"God for the right! I faltered,"
126,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"And lo, the train passed by."
127,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
128,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""Once more;--the strife is ended,"
129,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The solemn issue tried,"
130,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The Lord of Hosts, his mighty arm"
131,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Has helped our Israel's side;
132,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Gray stone and grassy hillock
133,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Tell where our martyrs died,"
134,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"But peaceful smiles the harvest,"
135,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And stainless flows the tide.
136,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
137,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""A crash, as when some swollen cloud"
138,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Cracks o'er the tangled trees
139,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"With side to side, and spar to spar,"
140,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Whose smoking decks are these?
141,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"I know Saint George's blood-red cross,"
142,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Thou Mistress of the Seas,"
143,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,But what is she whose streaming bars
144,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Roll out before the breeze?
145,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
146,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""Ah, well her iron ribs are knit,"
147,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Whose thunders strive to quell
148,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The bellowing throats, the blazing lips,"
149,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,That pealed the Armada's knell!
150,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The mist was cleared,--a wreath of stars"
151,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Rose o'er the crimsoned swell,"
152,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"And, wavering from its haughty peak,"
153,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The cross of England fell!
154,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
155,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""O trembling Faith! though dark the morn,"
156,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,A heavenly torch is thine;
157,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"While feebler races melt away,"
158,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"And paler orbs decline,"
159,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Still shall the fiery pillar's ray
160,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Along thy pathway shine,"
161,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,To light the chosen tribe that sought
162,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,This Western Palestine.
163,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
164,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"""I see the living tide roll on;"
165,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,It crowns with flaming towers
166,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The icy capes of Labrador,"
167,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The Spaniard's 'land of flowers'!
168,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,It streams beyond the splintered ridge
169,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,That parts the northern showers;
170,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,From eastern rock to sunset wave
171,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The Continent is ours!"""
172,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
173,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"He ceased, the grim old soldier-saint,"
174,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Then softly bent to cheer
175,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The Pilgrim-child, whose wasting face"
176,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Was meekly turned to hear;
177,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And drew his toil-worn sleeve across
178,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,To brush the manly tear
179,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"From cheeks that never changed in woe,"
180,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,And never blanched in fear.
181,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
182,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The weary Pilgrim slumbers,"
183,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,His resting-place unknown;
184,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"His hands were crossed, his lips were closed,"
185,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The dust was o'er him strown;
186,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The drifting soil, the mouldering leaf,"
187,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Along the sod were blown;
188,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"His mound has melted into earth,"
189,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,His memory lives alone.
190,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
191,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"So let it live unfading,"
192,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"The memory of the dead,"
193,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Long as the pale anemone
194,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Springs where their tears were shed,"
195,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Or, raining in the summer's wind"
196,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"In flakes of burning red,"
197,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The wild rose sprinkles with its leaves
198,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,The turf where once they bled!
199,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,
200,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Yea, when the frowning bulwarks"
201,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,That guard this holy strand
202,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,Have sunk beneath the trampling surge
203,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"In beds of sparkling sand,"
204,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,While in the waste of ocean
205,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"One hoary rock shall stand,"
206,THE PILGRIM'S VISION,"Be this its latest legend,--"
207,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!
208,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!,
209,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!,
210,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!,
211,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!,
212,HERE WAS THE PILGRIM'S LAND!,
213,THE STEAMBOAT,THE STEAMBOAT
214,THE STEAMBOAT,
215,THE STEAMBOAT,SEE how yon flaming herald treads
216,THE STEAMBOAT,"The ridged and rolling waves,"
217,THE STEAMBOAT,"As, crashing o'er their crested heads,"
218,THE STEAMBOAT,She bows her surly slaves!
219,THE STEAMBOAT,"With foam before and fire behind,"
220,THE STEAMBOAT,"She rends the clinging sea,"
221,THE STEAMBOAT,"That flies before the roaring wind,"
222,THE STEAMBOAT,Beneath her hissing lee.
223,THE STEAMBOAT,
224,THE STEAMBOAT,"The morning spray, like sea-born flowers,"
225,THE STEAMBOAT,"With heaped and glistening bells,"
226,THE STEAMBOAT,"Falls round her fast, in ringing showers,"
227,THE STEAMBOAT,With every wave that swells;
228,THE STEAMBOAT,"And, burning o'er the midnight deep,"
229,THE STEAMBOAT,"In lurid fringes thrown,"
230,THE STEAMBOAT,The living gems of ocean sweep
231,THE STEAMBOAT,Along her flashing zone.
232,THE STEAMBOAT,
233,THE STEAMBOAT,"With clashing wheel and lifting keel,"
234,THE STEAMBOAT,"And smoking torch on high,"
235,THE STEAMBOAT,"When winds are loud and billows reel,"
236,THE STEAMBOAT,She thunders foaming by;
237,THE STEAMBOAT,"When seas are silent and serene,"
238,THE STEAMBOAT,"With even beam she glides,"
239,THE STEAMBOAT,The sunshine glimmering through the green
240,THE STEAMBOAT,That skirts her gleaming sides.
241,THE STEAMBOAT,
242,THE STEAMBOAT,"Now, like a wild, nymph, far apart"
243,THE STEAMBOAT,"She veils her shadowy form,"
244,THE STEAMBOAT,The beating of her restless heart
245,THE STEAMBOAT,Still sounding through the storm;
246,THE STEAMBOAT,"Now answers, like a courtly dame,"
247,THE STEAMBOAT,"The reddening surges o'er,"
248,THE STEAMBOAT,"With flying scarf of spangled flame,"
249,THE STEAMBOAT,The Pharos of the shore.
250,THE STEAMBOAT,
251,THE STEAMBOAT,"To-night yon pilot shall not sleep,"
252,THE STEAMBOAT,Who trims his narrowed sail;
253,THE STEAMBOAT,To-night yon frigate scarce shall keep
254,THE STEAMBOAT,Her broad breast to the gale;
255,THE STEAMBOAT,"And many a foresail, scooped and strained,"
256,THE STEAMBOAT,"Shall break from yard and stay,"
257,THE STEAMBOAT,Before this smoky wreath has stained
258,THE STEAMBOAT,The rising mist of day.
259,THE STEAMBOAT,
260,THE STEAMBOAT,"Hark! hark! I hear yon whistling shroud,"
261,THE STEAMBOAT,I see yon quivering mast;
262,THE STEAMBOAT,The black throat of the hunted cloud
263,THE STEAMBOAT,Is panting forth the blast!
264,THE STEAMBOAT,"An hour, and, whirled like winnowing chaff,"
265,THE STEAMBOAT,The giant surge shall fling
266,THE STEAMBOAT,"His tresses o'er yon pennon staff,"
267,THE STEAMBOAT,White as the sea-bird's wing.
268,THE STEAMBOAT,
269,THE STEAMBOAT,"Yet rest, ye wanderers of the deep;"
270,THE STEAMBOAT,Nor wind nor wave shall tire
271,THE STEAMBOAT,"Those fleshless arms, whose pulses leap"
272,THE STEAMBOAT,With floods of living fire;
273,THE STEAMBOAT,"Sleep on, and, when the morning light"
274,THE STEAMBOAT,"Streams o'er the shining bay,"
275,THE STEAMBOAT,Oh think of those for whom the night
276,THE STEAMBOAT,Shall never wake in day.

283,LEXINGTON,
284,LEXINGTON,"SLOWLY the mist o'er the meadow was creeping,"
285,LEXINGTON,"Bright on the dewy buds glistened the sun,"
286,LEXINGTON,"When from his couch, while his children were sleeping,"
287,LEXINGTON,Rose the bold rebel and shouldered his gun.
288,LEXINGTON,Waving her golden veil
289,LEXINGTON,"Over the silent dale,"
290,LEXINGTON,Blithe looked the morning on cottage and spire;
291,LEXINGTON,"Hushed was his parting sigh,"
292,LEXINGTON,While from his noble eye
293,LEXINGTON,Flashed the last sparkle of liberty's fire.
294,LEXINGTON,
295,LEXINGTON,On the smooth green where the fresh leaf is springing
296,LEXINGTON,Calmly the first-born of glory have met;
297,LEXINGTON,Hark! the death-volley around them is ringing!
298,LEXINGTON,Look! with their life-blood the young grass is wet
299,LEXINGTON,"Faint is the feeble breath,"
300,LEXINGTON,"Murmuring low in death,"
301,LEXINGTON,"""Tell to our sons how their fathers have died;"""
302,LEXINGTON,"Nerveless the iron hand,"
303,LEXINGTON,"Raised for its native land,"
304,LEXINGTON,Lies by the weapon that gleams at its side.
305,LEXINGTON,
306,LEXINGTON,"Over the hillsides the wild knell is tolling,"
307,LEXINGTON,From their far hamlets the yeomanry come;
308,LEXINGTON,"As through the storm-clouds the thunder-burst rolling,"
309,LEXINGTON,Circles the beat of the mustering drum.
310,LEXINGTON,Fast on the soldier's path
311,LEXINGTON,"Darken the waves of wrath,--"
312,LEXINGTON,Long have they gathered and loud shall they fall;
313,LEXINGTON,"Red glares the musket's flash,"
314,LEXINGTON,"Sharp rings the rifle's crash,"
315,LEXINGTON,Blazing and clanging from thicket and wall.
316,LEXINGTON,
317,LEXINGTON,"Gayly the plume of the horseman was dancing,"
318,LEXINGTON,Never to shadow his cold brow again;
319,LEXINGTON,"Proudly at morning the war-steed was prancing,"
320,LEXINGTON,Reeking and panting he droops on the rein;
321,LEXINGTON,"Pale is the lip of scorn,"
322,LEXINGTON,"Voiceless the trumpet horn,"
323,LEXINGTON,Torn is the silken-fringed red cross on high;
324,LEXINGTON,Many a belted breast
325,LEXINGTON,Low on the turf shall rest
326,LEXINGTON,Ere the dark hunters the herd have passed by.
327,LEXINGTON,
328,LEXINGTON,"Snow-girdled crags where the hoarse wind is raving,"
329,LEXINGTON,"Rocks where the weary floods murmur and wail,"
330,LEXINGTON,"Wilds where the fern by the furrow is waving,"
331,LEXINGTON,Reeled with the echoes that rode on the gale;
332,LEXINGTON,Far as the tempest thrills
333,LEXINGTON,"Over the darkened hills,"
334,LEXINGTON,"Far as the sunshine streams over the plain,"
335,LEXINGTON,"Roused by the tyrant band,"
336,LEXINGTON,"Woke all the mighty land,"
337,LEXINGTON,"Girded for battle, from mountain to main."
338,LEXINGTON,
339,LEXINGTON,Green be the graves where her martyrs are lying!
340,LEXINGTON,"Shroudless and tombless they sunk to their rest,"
341,LEXINGTON,While o'er their ashes the starry fold flying
342,LEXINGTON,Wraps the proud eagle they roused from his nest.
343,LEXINGTON,"Borne on her Northern pine,"
344,LEXINGTON,Long o'er the foaming brine
345,LEXINGTON,Spread her broad banner to storm and to sun;
346,LEXINGTON,"Heaven keep her ever free,"
347,LEXINGTON,Wide as o'er land and sea
348,LEXINGTON,Floats the fair emblem her heroes have won.

355,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
356,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"This ""punch-bowl"" was, according to old family tradition, a caudle-cup."
357,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"It is a massive piece of silver, its cherubs and other ornaments of"
358,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"coarse repousse work, and has two handles like a loving-cup, by which"
359,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"it was held, or passed from guest to guest."
360,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
361,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"THIS ancient silver bowl of mine, it tells of good old times,"
362,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"Of joyous days and jolly nights, and merry Christmas times;"
363,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"They were a free and jovial race, but honest, brave, and true,"
364,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,Who dipped their ladle in the punch when this old bowl was new.
365,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
366,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"A Spanish galleon brought the bar,--so runs the ancient tale;"
367,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"'T was hammered by an Antwerp smith, whose arm was like a flail;"
368,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"And now and then between the strokes, for fear his strength should fail,"
369,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,He wiped his brow and quaffed a cup of good old Flemish ale.
370,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
371,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"'T was purchased by an English squire to please his loving dame,"
372,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"Who saw the cherubs, and conceived a longing for the same;"
373,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"And oft as on the ancient stock another twig was found,"
374,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"'T was filled with candle spiced and hot, and handed smoking round."
375,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
376,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"But, changing hands, it reached at length a Puritan divine,"
377,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"Who used to follow Timothy, and take a little wine,"
378,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"But hated punch and prelacy; and so it was, perhaps,"
379,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"He went to Leyden, where he found conventicles and schnapps."
380,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
381,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"And then, of course, you know what's next: it left the Dutchman's shore"
382,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"With those that in the Mayflower came,--a hundred souls and more,--"
383,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"Along with all the furniture, to fill their new abodes,--"
384,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"To judge by what is still on hand, at least a hundred loads."
385,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
386,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"'T was on a dreary winter's eve, the night was closing, dim,"
387,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"When brave Miles Standish took the bowl, and filled it to the brim;"
388,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"The little Captain stood and stirred the posset with his sword,"
389,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,And all his sturdy men-at-arms were ranged about the board.
390,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
391,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"He poured the fiery Hollands in,--the man that never feared,--"
392,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"He took a long and solemn draught, and wiped his yellow beard;"
393,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,And one by one the musketeers--the men that fought and prayed--
394,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"All drank as 't were their mother's milk, and not a man afraid."
395,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
396,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"That night, affrighted from his nest, the screaming eagle flew,"
397,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"He heard the Pequot's ringing whoop, the soldier's wild halloo;"
398,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"And there the sachem learned the rule he taught to kith and kin,"
399,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"Run from the white man when you find he smells of ""Hollands gin!"""
400,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,
401,ON LENDING A PUNCH-BOWL,"A hundred years, and fifty more, had spread their leaves and snows,"

808,NUX POSTCOENATICA,With a very heavy quarto and a very lively bug;
809,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"The true bug had been organized with only two antennae,"
810,NUX POSTCOENATICA,But the humbug in the copperplate would have them twice as many.
811,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
812,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And I thought, like Dr. Faustus, of the emptiness of art,"
813,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"How we take a fragment for the whole, and call the whole a part,"
814,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"When I heard a heavy footstep that was loud enough for two,"
815,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And a man of forty entered, exclaiming, ""How d' ye do?"""
816,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
817,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"He was not a ghost, my visitor, but solid flesh and bone;"
818,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"He wore a Palo Alto hat, his weight was twenty stone;"
819,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"(It's odd how hats expand their brims as riper years invade,"

838,NUX POSTCOENATICA,A man that wrongs his manliness by laughing like a boy?

843,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"On a copperplate of faces that would stretch at least a mile,"
844,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"That, what with sneers from enemies and cheapening shrugs of friends,"

846,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
847,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"It's a vastly pleasing prospect, when you're screwing out a laugh,"
848,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"That your very next year's income is diminished by a half,"
849,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And a little boy trips barefoot that Pegasus may go,"
850,NUX POSTCOENATICA,And the baby's milk is watered that your Helicon may flow!
851,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
852,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"No;--the joke has been a good one,--but I'm getting fond of quiet,"
853,NUX POSTCOENATICA,And I don't like deviations from my customary diet;
854,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"So I think I will not go with you to hear the toasts and speeches,"

859,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"The force that wheels the planets round delights in spinning tops,"
860,NUX POSTCOENATICA,And that young earthquake t' other day was great at shaking props.
861,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
862,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"I tell you what, philosopher, if all the longest heads"
863,NUX POSTCOENATICA,That ever knocked their sinciputs in stretching on their beds
864,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Were round one great mahogany, I'd beat those fine old folks"
865,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"With twenty dishes, twenty fools, and twenty clever jokes!"
866,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
867,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Why, if Columbus should be there, the company would beg"
868,NUX POSTCOENATICA,He'd show that little trick of his of balancing the egg!
869,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Milton to Stilton would give in, and Solomon to Salmon,"
870,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And Roger Bacon be a bore, and Francis Bacon gammon!"
871,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
872,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And as for all the ""patronage"" of all the clowns and boors"
873,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"That squint their little narrow eyes at any freak of yours,"
874,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Do leave them to your prosier friends,--such fellows ought to die"
875,NUX POSTCOENATICA,When rhubarb is so very scarce and ipecac so high!
876,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
877,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And so I come,--like Lochinvar, to tread a single measure,--"
878,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"To purchase with a loaf of bread a sugar-plum of pleasure,"
879,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"To enter for the cup of glass that's run for after dinner,"
880,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Which yields a single sparkling draught,"
881,NUX POSTCOENATICA,then breaks and cuts the winner.
882,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
883,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Ah, that's the way delusion comes,--a glass of old Madeira,"
884,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"A pair of visual diaphragms revolved by Jane or Sarah,"
885,NUX POSTCOENATICA,And down go vows and promises without the slightest question
886,NUX POSTCOENATICA,If eating words won't compromise the organs of digestion!
887,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
888,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"And yet, among my native shades, beside my nursing mother,"
889,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"Where every stranger seems a friend, and every friend a brother,"
890,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"I feel the old convivial glow (unaided) o'er me stealing,--"
891,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"The warm, champagny, the old-particular brandy-punchy feeling."
892,NUX POSTCOENATICA,
893,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"We're all alike;--Vesuvius flings the scoriae from his fountain,"
894,NUX POSTCOENATICA,But down they come in volleying rain back to the burning mountain;
895,NUX POSTCOENATICA,"We leave, like those volcanic stones, our precious Alma Mater,"

1468,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),This poem was delivered before the Boston Mercantile Library
1469,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Association, October 14, 1846."
1470,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1471,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"YES, dear Enchantress,--wandering far and long,"
1472,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"In realms unperfumed by the breath of song,"
1473,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where flowers ill-flavored shed their sweets around,"
1474,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And bitterest roots invade the ungenial ground,"
1475,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose gems are crystals from the Epsom mine,"
1476,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose vineyards flow with antimonial wine,"
1477,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose gates admit no mirthful feature in,"
1478,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Save one gaunt mocker, the Sardonic grin,"
1479,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose pangs are real, not the woes of rhyme"
1480,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),That blue-eyed misses warble out of time;--
1481,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Truant, not recreant to thy sacred claim,"
1482,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Older by reckoning, but in heart the same,"
1483,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Freed for a moment from the chains of toil,"
1484,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I tread once more thy consecrated soil;
1485,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Here at thy feet my old allegiance own,"
1486,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Thy subject still, and loyal to thy throne!"
1487,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1488,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),My dazzled glance explores the crowded hall;
1489,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Alas, how vain to hope the smiles of all!"
1490,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I know my audience. All the gay and young
1491,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Love the light antics of a playful tongue;
1492,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And these, remembering some expansive line"
1493,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"My lips let loose among the nuts and wine,"
1494,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Are all impatience till the opening pun
1495,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Proclaims the witty shamfight is begun.
1496,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Two fifths at least, if not the total half,"
1497,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Have come infuriate for an earthquake laugh;
1498,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I know full well what alderman has tied
1499,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),His red bandanna tight about his side;
1500,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I see the mother, who, aware that boys"
1501,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Perform their laughter with superfluous noise,"
1502,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Beside her kerchief brought an extra one
1503,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To stop the explosions of her bursting son;
1504,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I know a tailor, once a friend of mine,"
1505,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Expects great doings in the button line,--"
1506,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For mirth's concussions rip the outward case,"
1507,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And plant the stitches in a tenderer place.
1508,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I know my audience,--these shall have their due;"
1509,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),A smile awaits them ere my song is through!
1510,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1511,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"I know myself. Not servile for applause,"
1512,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),My Muse permits no deprecating clause;
1513,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Modest or vain, she will not be denied"
1514,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),One bold confession due to honest pride;
1515,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And well she knows the drooping veil of song
1516,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Shall save her boldness from the caviller's wrong.
1517,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Her sweeter voice the Heavenly Maid imparts
1518,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To tell the secrets of our aching hearts
1519,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For this, a suppliant, captive, prostrate, bound,"
1520,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),She kneels imploring at the feet of sound;
1521,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"For this, convulsed in thought's maternal pains,"
1522,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),She loads her arms with rhyme's resounding chains;
1523,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faint though the music of her fetters be,"
1524,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"It lends one charm,--her lips are ever free!"
1525,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1526,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Think not I come, in manhood's fiery noon,"
1527,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To steal his laurels from the stage buffoon;
1528,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),His sword of lath the harlequin may wield;
1529,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Behold the star upon my lifted shield
1530,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Though the just critic pass my humble name,"
1531,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And sweeter lips have drained the cup of fame,"
1532,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While my gay stanza pleased the banquet's lords,"
1533,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The soul within was tuned to deeper chords!
1534,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Say, shall my arms, in other conflicts taught"
1535,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To swing aloft the ponderous mace of thought,"
1536,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Lift, in obedience to a school-girl's law,"
1537,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Mirth's tinsel wand or laughter's tickling straw?
1538,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Say, shall I wound with satire's rankling spear"
1539,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The pure, warm hearts that bid me welcome here?"
1540,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No! while I wander through the land of dreams,"
1541,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To strive with great and play with trifling themes,"
1542,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Let some kind meaning fill the varied line.
1543,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),You have your judgment; will you trust to mine?
1544,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1545,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),. . . . . . . . . .
1546,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1547,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Between two breaths what crowded mysteries lie,--"
1548,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The first short gasp, the last and long-drawn sigh!"
1549,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Like phantoms painted on the magic slide,"
1550,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Forth from the darkness of the past we glide,"
1551,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),As living shadows for a moment seen
1552,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"In airy pageant on the eternal screen,"
1553,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Traced by a ray from one unchanging flame,"
1554,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Then seek the dust and stillness whence we came.
1555,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1556,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But whence and why, our trembling souls inquire,"
1557,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Caught these dim visions their awakening fire?
1558,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh, who forgets when first the piercing thought"
1559,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through childhood's musings found its way unsought?
1560,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),I AM;--I LIVE. The mystery and the fear
1561,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"When the dread question, WHAT HAS BROUGHT ME HERE?"
1562,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Burst through life's twilight, as before the sun"
1563,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Roll the deep thunders of the morning gun!
1564,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1565,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Are angel faces, silent and serene,"
1566,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Bent on the conflicts of this little scene,"
1567,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose dream-like efforts, whose unreal strife,"
1568,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Are but the preludes to a larger life?
1569,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1570,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Or does life's summer see the end of all,"
1571,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"These leaves of being mouldering as they fall,"
1572,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As the old poet vaguely used to deem,"
1573,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),As WESLEY questioned in his youthful dream?
1574,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh, could such mockery reach our souls indeed,"
1575,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Give back the Pharaohs' or the Athenian's creed;
1576,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Better than this a Heaven of man's device,--"
1577,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Indian's sports, the Moslem's paradise!"
1578,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1579,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Or is our being's only end and aim
1580,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To add new glories to our Maker's name,"
1581,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As the poor insect, shrivelling in the blaze,"
1582,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Lends a faint sparkle to its streaming rays?
1583,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Does earth send upward to the Eternal's ear
1584,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The mingled discords of her jarring sphere
1585,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To swell his anthem, while creation rings"
1586,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),With notes of anguish from its shattered strings?
1587,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Is it for this the immortal Artist means
1588,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"These conscious, throbbing, agonized machines?"
1589,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1590,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Dark is the soul whose sullen creed can bind
1591,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),In chains like these the all-embracing Mind;
1592,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No! two-faced bigot, thou dost ill reprove"
1593,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The sensual, selfish, yet benignant Jove,"
1594,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And praise a tyrant throned in lonely pride,"
1595,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who loves himself, and cares for naught beside;"
1596,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who gave thee, summoned from primeval night,"
1597,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A thousand laws, and not a single right,--"
1598,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A heart to feel, and quivering nerves to thrill,"
1599,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The sense of wrong, the death-defying will;"
1600,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Who girt thy senses with this goodly frame,"
1601,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Its earthly glories and its orbs of flame,"
1602,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Not for thyself, unworthy of a thought,"
1603,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Poor helpless victim of a life unsought,"
1604,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But all for him, unchanging and supreme,"
1605,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The heartless centre of thy frozen scheme.
1606,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1607,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Trust not the teacher with his lying scroll,"
1608,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Who tears the charter of thy shuddering soul;
1609,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The God of love, who gave the breath that warms"
1610,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"All living dust in all its varied forms,"
1611,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Asks not the tribute of a world like this
1612,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To fill the measure of his perfect bliss.
1613,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Though winged with life through all its radiant shores,"
1614,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Creation flowed with unexhausted stores
1615,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Cherub and seraph had not yet enjoyed;
1616,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),For this he called thee from the quickening void!
1617,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Nor this alone; a larger gift was thine,"
1618,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),A mightier purpose swelled his vast design
1619,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Thought,--conscience,--will,--to make them all thine own,"
1620,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),He rent a pillar from the eternal throne!
1621,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1622,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Made in his image, thou must nobly dare"
1623,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The thorny crown of sovereignty to share.
1624,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"With eye uplifted, it is thine to view,"
1625,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"From thine own centre, Heaven's o'erarching blue;"
1626,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),So round thy heart a beaming circle lies
1627,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No fiend can blot, no hypocrite disguise;"
1628,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"From all its orbs one cheering voice is heard,"
1629,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Full to thine ear it bears the Father's word,"
1630,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Now, as in Eden where his first-born trod"
1631,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"""Seek thine own welfare, true to man and God!"""
1632,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Think not too meanly of thy low estate;
1633,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Thou hast a choice; to choose is to create!
1634,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Remember whose the sacred lips that tell,"
1635,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Angels approve thee when thy choice is well;
1636,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Remember, One, a judge of righteous men,"
1637,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Swore to spare Sodom if she held but ten!
1638,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Use well the freedom which thy Master gave,"
1639,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),(Think'st thou that Heaven can tolerate a slave?)
1640,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And He who made thee to be just and true
1641,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Will bless thee, love thee,--ay, respect thee too!"
1642,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1643,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Nature has placed thee on a changeful tide,"
1644,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"To breast its waves, but not without a guide;"
1645,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yet, as the needle will forget its aim,"
1646,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Jarred by the fury of the electric flame,"
1647,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"As the true current it will falsely feel,"
1648,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Warped from its axis by a freight of steel;
1649,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),So will thy CONSCIENCE lose its balanced truth
1650,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"If passion's lightning fall upon thy youth,"
1651,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),So the pure effluence quit its sacred hold
1652,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Girt round too deeply with magnetic gold.
1653,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Go to yon tower, where busy science plies"
1654,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Her vast antennae, feeling through the skies"
1655,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),That little vernier on whose slender lines
1656,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The midnight taper trembles as it shines,"
1657,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A silent index, tracks the planets' march"
1658,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),In all their wanderings through the ethereal arch;
1659,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Tells through the mist where dazzled Mercury burns,"
1660,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And marks the spot where Uranus returns.
1661,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"So, till by wrong or negligence effaced,"
1662,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The living index which thy Maker traced
1663,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Repeats the line each starry Virtue draws
1664,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through the wide circuit of creation's laws;
1665,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Still tracks unchanged the everlasting ray
1666,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where the dark shadows of temptation stray,"
1667,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But, once defaced, forgets the orbs of light,"
1668,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And leaves thee wandering o'er the expanse of night.
1669,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1670,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"""What is thy creed?"" a hundred lips inquire;"
1671,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"""Thou seekest God beneath what Christian spire?"""
1672,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Nor ask they idly, for uncounted lies"
1673,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Float upward on the smoke of sacrifice;
1674,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"When man's first incense rose above the plain,"
1675,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Of earth's two altars one was built by Cain!
1676,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Uncursed by doubt, our earliest creed we take;"
1677,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),We love the precepts for the teacher's sake;
1678,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The simple lessons which the nursery taught
1679,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Fell soft and stainless on the buds of thought,"
1680,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And the full blossom owes its fairest hue
1681,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To those sweet tear-drops of affection's dew.
1682,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Too oft the light that led our earlier hours
1683,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Fades with the perfume of our cradle flowers;
1684,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The clear, cold question chills to frozen doubt;"
1685,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Tired of beliefs, we dread to live without"
1686,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oh then, if Reason waver at thy side,"
1687,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Let humbler Memory be thy gentle guide;
1688,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Go to thy birthplace, and, if faith was there,"
1689,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Repeat thy father's creed, thy mother's prayer!"
1690,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1691,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faith loves to lean on Time's destroying arm,"
1692,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And age, like distance, lends a double charm;"
1693,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"In dim cathedrals, dark with vaulted gloom,"
1694,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What holy awe invests the saintly tomb!
1695,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"There pride will bow, and anxious care expand,"
1696,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And creeping avarice come with open hand;
1697,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The gay can weep, the impious can adore,"
1698,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),From morn's first glimmerings on the chancel floor
1699,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Till dying sunset sheds his crimson stains
1700,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through the faint halos of the irised panes.
1701,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Yet there are graves, whose rudely-shapen sod"
1702,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Bears the fresh footprints where the sexton trod;
1703,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Graves where the verdure has not dared to shoot,"
1704,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Where the chance wild-flower has not fixed its root,"
1705,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whose slumbering tenants, dead without a name,"
1706,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The eternal record shall at length proclaim
1707,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Pure as the holiest in the long array
1708,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Of hooded, mitred, or tiaraed clay!"
1709,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1710,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Come, seek the air; some pictures we may gain"

1731,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Wakes the sharp echoes with the quivering thrill
1732,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Of keen vibrations, tremulous and shrill;"
1733,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Aloft, suspended in the morning's fire,"
1734,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Crash the vast cymbals from the Southern spire;
1735,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Giant, standing by the elm-clad green,"

1737,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Whirling in air his brazen goblet round,"
1738,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Swings from its brim the swollen floods of sound;
1739,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While, sad with memories of the olden time,"
1740,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Throbs from his tower the Northern Minstrel's chime,--"
1741,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faint, single tones, that spell their ancient song,"

1747,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Mourns on the winds that sigh in every zone.
1748,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),When Ceylon sweeps thee with her perfumed breeze
1749,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Through the warm billows of the Indian seas;
1750,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),When--ship and shadow blended both in one--
1751,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Flames o'er thy mast the equatorial sun,"
1752,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),From sparkling midnight to refulgent noon
1753,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Thy canvas swelling with the still monsoon;
1754,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"When through thy shrouds the wild tornado sings,"
1755,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"And thy poor sea-bird folds her tattered wings,--"
1756,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Oft will delusion o'er thy senses steal,"

1760,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Home, with its smiling board, its cheering fire,"
1761,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The half-choked welcome of the expecting sire,"

1764,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Ah, let the dreamer o'er the taffrail lean"

1771,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),See through the streets that slumbered in repose
1772,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The living current of devotion flows,"
1773,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Its varied forms in one harmonious band
1774,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Age leading childhood by its dimpled hand;
1775,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Want, in the robe whose faded edges fall"
1776,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),To tell of rags beneath the tartan shawl;

1781,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Alone she wanders where with HIM she trod,"
1782,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"No arm to stay her, but she leans on God."
1783,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"While other doublets deviate here and there,"
1784,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What secret handcuff binds that pretty pair?
1785,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Compactest couple! pressing side to side,--"
1786,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Ah, the white bonnet that reveals the bride!"
1787,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"By the white neckcloth, with its straitened tie,"

1793,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A livelier bearing of the outward man,"
1794,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The light-hued gloves, the undevout rattan,"
1795,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Now smartly raised or half profanely twirled,--"
1796,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"A bright, fresh twinkle from the week-day world,--"
1797,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Tell their plain story; yes, thine eyes behold"
1798,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),A cheerful Christian from the liberal fold.
1799,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Down the chill street that curves in gloomiest shade
1800,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What marks betray yon solitary maid?

1802,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The Celtic hue that shades her braided hair,"
1803,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"The gilded missal in her kerchief tied,--"
1804,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Poor Nora, exile from Killarney's side!"
1805,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Sister in toil, though blanched by colder skies,"

1835,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1836,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Deal meekly, gently, with the hopes that guide"

1839,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"If wrong, the verdict is for God alone."
1840,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1841,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What though the champions of thy faith esteem
1842,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The sprinkled fountain or baptismal stream;
1843,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Shall jealous passions in unseemly strife
1844,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Cross their dark weapons o'er the waves of life?

1855,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Must thou be raking in the crumbled past
1856,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),For racks and fagots in her teeth to cast?
1857,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),See from the ashes of Helvetia's pile
1858,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),The whitened skull of old Servetus smile!
1859,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Round her young heart thy ""Romish Upas"" threw"
1860,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Its firm, deep fibres, strengthening as she grew;"
1861,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Thy sneering voice may call them ""Popish tricks,"""
1862,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Her Latin prayers, her dangling crucifix,"
1863,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"But De Profundis blessed her father's grave,"
1864,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"That ""idol"" cross her dying mother gave!"
1865,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),What if some angel looks with equal eyes

1875,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),
1876,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Faith; Conscience; Love. A meaner task remains,"
1877,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And humbler thoughts must creep in lowlier strains.
1878,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Shalt thou be honest? Ask the worldly schools,"
1879,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),And all will tell thee knaves are busier fools;
1880,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Prudent? Industrious? Let not modern pens
1881,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Instruct ""Poor Richard's"" fellow-citizens."

1899,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Just in the focus of a nervous race,"
1900,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Fretful to change and rabid to discuss,"
1901,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Full of excitements, always in a fuss."
1902,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Think of the patriarchs; then compare as men

1912,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Your weight of metal and your size of ball.
1913,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Track not the steps of such as hold you cheap,"
1914,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),"Too mean to prize, though good enough to keep;"

1916,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Are little people fed on great men's crumbs.
1917,A RHYMED LESSON (URANIA),Yet keep no followers of that hateful brood

2330,(TERPSICHORE),As the lost rustic on some festal day
2331,(TERPSICHORE),"Stares through the concourse in its vast array,--"
2332,(TERPSICHORE),"Where in one cake a throng of faces runs,"
2333,(TERPSICHORE),"All stuck together like a sheet of buns,--"
2334,(TERPSICHORE),"And throws the bait of some unheeded name,"
2335,(TERPSICHORE),"Or shoots a wink with most uncertain aim,"
2336,(TERPSICHORE),"So roams my vision, wandering over all,"
2337,(TERPSICHORE),"And strives to choose, but knows not where to fall."
2338,(TERPSICHORE),
2339,(TERPSICHORE),"Skins of flayed authors, husks of dead reviews,"
2340,(TERPSICHORE),"The turn-coat's clothes, the office-seeker's shoes,"
2341,(TERPSICHORE),"Scraps from cold feasts, where conversation runs"
2342,(TERPSICHORE),"Through mouldy toasts to oxidated puns,"
2343,(TERPSICHORE),"And grating songs a listening crowd endures,"
2344,(TERPSICHORE),Rasped from the throats of bellowing amateurs;
2345,(TERPSICHORE),"Sermons, whose writers played such dangerous tricks"
2346,(TERPSICHORE),"Their own heresiarchs called them heretics,"
2347,(TERPSICHORE),"(Strange that one term such distant poles should link,"
2348,(TERPSICHORE),The Priestleyan's copper and the Puseyan's zinc);
2349,(TERPSICHORE),Poems that shuffle with superfluous legs
2350,(TERPSICHORE),"A blindfold minuet over addled eggs,"
2351,(TERPSICHORE),"Where all the syllables that end in ed,"
2352,(TERPSICHORE),"Like old dragoons, have cuts across the head;"
2353,(TERPSICHORE),Essays so dark Champollion might despair
2354,(TERPSICHORE),"To guess what mummy of a thought was there,"
2355,(TERPSICHORE),"Where our poor English, striped with foreign phrase,"
2356,(TERPSICHORE),Looks like a zebra in a parson's chaise;
2357,(TERPSICHORE),"Lectures that cut our dinners down to roots,"
2358,(TERPSICHORE),"Or prove (by monkeys) men should stick to fruits,--"
2359,(TERPSICHORE),"Delusive error, as at trifling charge"
2360,(TERPSICHORE),Professor Gripes will certify at large;
2361,(TERPSICHORE),"Mesmeric pamphlets, which to facts appeal,"
2362,(TERPSICHORE),Each fact as slippery as a fresh-caught eel;
2363,(TERPSICHORE),"And figured heads, whose hieroglyphs invite"
2364,(TERPSICHORE),To wandering knaves that discount fools at sight:
2365,(TERPSICHORE),"Such things as these, with heaps of unpaid bills,"
2366,(TERPSICHORE),"And candy puffs and homoeopathic pills,"
2367,(TERPSICHORE),"And ancient bell-crowns with contracted rim,"
2368,(TERPSICHORE),"And bonnets hideous with expanded brim,"
2369,(TERPSICHORE),"And coats whose memory turns the sartor pale,"
2370,(TERPSICHORE),"Their sequels tapering like a lizard's tale,--"
2371,(TERPSICHORE),"How might we spread them to the smiling day,"
2372,(TERPSICHORE),"And toss them, fluttering like the new-mown hay,"
2373,(TERPSICHORE),"To laughter's light or sorrow's pitying shower,"
2374,(TERPSICHORE),Were these brief minutes lengthened to an hour.
2375,(TERPSICHORE),
2376,(TERPSICHORE),"The narrow moments fit like Sunday shoes,--"
2377,(TERPSICHORE),"How vast the heap, how quickly must we choose!"
2378,(TERPSICHORE),A few small scraps from out his mountain mass
2379,(TERPSICHORE),"We snatch in haste, and let the vagrant pass."
2380,(TERPSICHORE),"This shrunken CRUST that Cerberus could not bite,"
2381,(TERPSICHORE),"Stamped (in one corner) ""Pickwick copyright,"""
2382,(TERPSICHORE),"Kneaded by youngsters, raised by flattery's yeast,"
2383,(TERPSICHORE),"Was once a loaf, and helped to make a feast."
2384,(TERPSICHORE),He for whose sake the glittering show appears
2385,(TERPSICHORE),"Has sown the world with laughter and with tears,"
2386,(TERPSICHORE),And they whose welcome wets the bumper's brim
2387,(TERPSICHORE),"Have wit and wisdom,--for they all quote him."
2388,(TERPSICHORE),"So, many a tongue the evening hour prolongs"
2389,(TERPSICHORE),"With spangled speeches,--let alone the songs;"
2390,(TERPSICHORE),"Statesmen grow merry, lean attorneys laugh,"
2391,(TERPSICHORE),"And weak teetotals warm to half and half,"
2392,(TERPSICHORE),"And beardless Tullys, new to festive scenes,"
2393,(TERPSICHORE),"Cut their first crop of youth's precocious greens,"
2394,(TERPSICHORE),"And wits stand ready for impromptu claps,"
2395,(TERPSICHORE),"With loaded barrels and percussion caps,"
2396,(TERPSICHORE),"And Pathos, cantering through the minor keys,"
2397,(TERPSICHORE),Waves all her onions to the trembling breeze;
2398,(TERPSICHORE),While the great Feasted views with silent glee
2399,(TERPSICHORE),His scattered limbs in Yankee fricassee.
2400,(TERPSICHORE),
2401,(TERPSICHORE),Sweet is the scene where genial friendship plays
2402,(TERPSICHORE),The pleasing game of interchanging praise.
2403,(TERPSICHORE),"Self-love, grimalkin of the human heart,"
2404,(TERPSICHORE),Is ever pliant to the master's art;
2405,(TERPSICHORE),"Soothed with a word, she peacefully withdraws"
2406,(TERPSICHORE),"And sheathes in velvet her obnoxious claws,"
2407,(TERPSICHORE),And thrills the hand that smooths her glossy fur
2408,(TERPSICHORE),With the light tremor of her grateful purr.
2409,(TERPSICHORE),
2410,(TERPSICHORE),"But what sad music fills the quiet hall,"
2411,(TERPSICHORE),If on her back a feline rival fall!
2412,(TERPSICHORE),"And oh, what noises shake the tranquil house"
2413,(TERPSICHORE),If old Self-interest cheats her of a mouse.
2414,(TERPSICHORE),
2415,(TERPSICHORE),"Thou, O my country, hast thy foolish ways,"
2416,(TERPSICHORE),Too apt to purr at every stranger's praise;
2417,(TERPSICHORE),"But if the stranger touch thy modes or laws,"
2418,(TERPSICHORE),Off goes the velvet and out come the claws!
2419,(TERPSICHORE),"And thou, Illustrious! but too poorly paid"
2420,(TERPSICHORE),"In toasts from Pickwick for thy great crusade,"
2421,(TERPSICHORE),"Though, while the echoes labored with thy name,"
2422,(TERPSICHORE),"The public trap denied thy little game,"
2423,(TERPSICHORE),"Let other lips our jealous laws revile,--"
2424,(TERPSICHORE),"The marble Talfourd or the rude Carlyle,--"
2425,(TERPSICHORE),"But on thy lids, which Heaven forbids to close"
2426,(TERPSICHORE),"Where'er the light of kindly nature glows,"
2427,(TERPSICHORE),Let not the dollars that a churl denies
2428,(TERPSICHORE),Weigh like the shillings on a dead man's eyes!
2429,(TERPSICHORE),"Or, if thou wilt, be more discreetly blind,"
2430,(TERPSICHORE),Nor ask to see all wide extremes combined.
2431,(TERPSICHORE),Not in our wastes the dainty blossoms smile
2432,(TERPSICHORE),That crowd the gardens of thy scanty isle.
2433,(TERPSICHORE),There white-cheeked Luxury weaves a thousand charms;
2434,(TERPSICHORE),Here sun-browned Labor swings his naked arms.
2435,(TERPSICHORE),Long are the furrows he must trace between
2436,(TERPSICHORE),The ocean's azure and the prairie's green;
2437,(TERPSICHORE),"Full many a blank his destined realm displays,"
2438,(TERPSICHORE),Yet sees the promise of his riper days
2439,(TERPSICHORE),"Far through yon depths the panting engine moves,"
2440,(TERPSICHORE),His chariots ringing in their steel-shod grooves;
2441,(TERPSICHORE),And Erie's naiad flings her diamond wave
2442,(TERPSICHORE),O'er the wild sea-nymph in her distant cave!
2443,(TERPSICHORE),"While tasks like these employ his anxious hours,"
2444,(TERPSICHORE),What if his cornfields are not edged with flowers?
2445,(TERPSICHORE),Though bright as silver the meridian beams
2446,(TERPSICHORE),"Shine through the crystal of thine English streams,"
2447,(TERPSICHORE),Turbid and dark the mighty wave is whirled
2448,(TERPSICHORE),That drains our Andes and divides a world!
2449,(TERPSICHORE),
2450,(TERPSICHORE),But lo! a PARCHMENT! Surely it would seem
2451,(TERPSICHORE),The sculptured impress speaks of power supreme;
2452,(TERPSICHORE),Some grave design the solemn page must claim
2453,(TERPSICHORE),That shows so broadly an emblazoned name.
2454,(TERPSICHORE),"A sovereign's promise! Look, the lines afford"
2455,(TERPSICHORE),All Honor gives when Caution asks his word:
2456,(TERPSICHORE),"There sacred Faith has laid her snow-white hands,"
2457,(TERPSICHORE),And awful Justice knit her iron bands;
2458,(TERPSICHORE),"Yet every leaf is stained with treachery's dye,"
2459,(TERPSICHORE),And every letter crusted with a lie.
2460,(TERPSICHORE),Alas! no treason has degraded yet
2461,(TERPSICHORE),"The Arab's salt, the Indian's calumet;"
2462,(TERPSICHORE),"A simple rite, that bears the wanderer's pledge,"
2463,(TERPSICHORE),Blunts the keen shaft and turns the dagger's edge;
2464,(TERPSICHORE),"While jockeying senates stop to sign and seal,"
2465,(TERPSICHORE),And freeborn statesmen legislate to steal.
2466,(TERPSICHORE),"Rise, Europe, tottering with thine Atlas load,"
2467,(TERPSICHORE),"Turn thy proud eye to Freedom's blest abode,"
2468,(TERPSICHORE),"And round her forehead, wreathed with heavenly flame,"
2469,(TERPSICHORE),Bind the dark garland of her daughter's shame!
2470,(TERPSICHORE),"Ye ocean clouds, that wrap the angry blast,"
2471,(TERPSICHORE),"Coil her stained ensign round its haughty mast,"
2472,(TERPSICHORE),"Or tear the fold that wears so foul a scar,"
2473,(TERPSICHORE),And drive a bolt through every blackened star!
2474,(TERPSICHORE),"Once more,--once only,--- we must stop so soon:"
2475,(TERPSICHORE),What have we here? A GERMAN-SILVER SPOON;
2476,(TERPSICHORE),"A cheap utensil, which we often see"
2477,(TERPSICHORE),"Used by the dabblers in aesthetic tea,"
2478,(TERPSICHORE),"Of slender fabric, somewhat light and thin,"
2479,(TERPSICHORE),"Made of mixed metal, chiefly lead and tin;"
2480,(TERPSICHORE),"The bowl is shallow, and the handle small,"
2481,(TERPSICHORE),Marked in large letters with the name JEAN PAUL.
2482,(TERPSICHORE),"Small as it is, its powers are passing strange,"
2483,(TERPSICHORE),For all who use it show a wondrous change;
2484,(TERPSICHORE),"And first, a fact to make the barbers stare,"
2485,(TERPSICHORE),It beats Macassar for the growth of hair.
2486,(TERPSICHORE),See those small youngsters whose expansive ears
2487,(TERPSICHORE),Maternal kindness grazed with frequent shears;
2488,(TERPSICHORE),"Each bristling crop a dangling mass becomes,"
2489,(TERPSICHORE),And all the spoonies turn to Absaloms
2490,(TERPSICHORE),"Nor this alone its magic power displays,"
2491,(TERPSICHORE),It alters strangely all their works and ways;
2492,(TERPSICHORE),"With uncouth words they tire their tender lungs,"
2493,(TERPSICHORE),The same bald phrases on their hundred tongues
2494,(TERPSICHORE),"""Ever"" ""The Ages"" in their page appear,"
2495,(TERPSICHORE),"""Alway"" the bedlamite is called a ""Seer;"""
2496,(TERPSICHORE),"On every leaf the ""earnest"" sage may scan,"
2497,(TERPSICHORE),"Portentous bore! their ""many-sided"" man,--"
2498,(TERPSICHORE),"A weak eclectic, groping vague and dim,"
2499,(TERPSICHORE),"Whose every angle is a half-starved whim,"
2500,(TERPSICHORE),"Blind as a mole and curious as a lynx,"
2501,(TERPSICHORE),"Who rides a beetle, which he calls a ""Sphinx."""
2502,(TERPSICHORE),"And oh, what questions asked in clubfoot rhyme"
2503,(TERPSICHORE),Of Earth the tongueless and the deaf-mute Time!
2504,(TERPSICHORE),
2505,(TERPSICHORE),"Here babbling ""Insight"" shouts in Nature's ears"
2506,(TERPSICHORE),His last conundrum on the orbs and spheres;
2507,(TERPSICHORE),"There Self-inspection sucks its little thumb,"
2508,(TERPSICHORE),"With ""Whence am I?"" and ""Wherefore did I come?"""
2509,(TERPSICHORE),Deluded infants! will they ever know
2510,(TERPSICHORE),"Some doubts must darken o'er the world below,"
2511,(TERPSICHORE),Though all the Platos of the nursery trail
2512,(TERPSICHORE),"Their ""clouds of glory"" at the go-cart's tail?"
2513,(TERPSICHORE),Oh might these couplets their attention claim
2514,(TERPSICHORE),That gain their author the Philistine's name
2515,(TERPSICHORE),"(A stubborn race, that, spurning foreign law,"
2516,(TERPSICHORE),Was much belabored with an ass's jaw.)
2517,(TERPSICHORE),
2518,(TERPSICHORE),Melodious Laura! From the sad retreats
2519,(TERPSICHORE),"That hold thee, smothered with excess of sweets,"
2520,(TERPSICHORE),"Shade of a shadow, spectre of a dream,"
2521,(TERPSICHORE),Glance thy wan eye across the Stygian stream!
2522,(TERPSICHORE),"The slipshod dreamer treads thy fragrant halls,"
2523,(TERPSICHORE),"The sophist's cobwebs hang thy roseate walls,"
2524,(TERPSICHORE),And o'er the crotchets of thy jingling tunes
2525,(TERPSICHORE),"The bard of mystery scrawls his crooked ""runes."""
2526,(TERPSICHORE),"Yes, thou art gone, with all the tuneful hordes"
2527,(TERPSICHORE),"That candied thoughts in amber-colored words,"
2528,(TERPSICHORE),And in the precincts of thy late abodes
2529,(TERPSICHORE),The clattering verse-wright hammers Orphic odes.
2530,(TERPSICHORE),"Thou, soft as zephyr, wast content to fly"
2531,(TERPSICHORE),On the gilt pinions of a balmy sigh;
2532,(TERPSICHORE),"He, vast as Phoebus on his burning wheels,"
2533,(TERPSICHORE),Would stride through ether at Orion's heels.
2534,(TERPSICHORE),"Thy emblem, Laura, was a perfume-jar,"
2535,(TERPSICHORE),"And thine, young Orpheus, is a pewter star."
2536,(TERPSICHORE),"The balance trembles,--be its verdict told"
2537,(TERPSICHORE),When the new jargon slumbers with the old!
2538,(TERPSICHORE),
2539,(TERPSICHORE),. . . . . . . .
2540,(TERPSICHORE),
2541,(TERPSICHORE),"Cease, playful goddess! From thine airy bound"
2542,(TERPSICHORE),Drop like a feather softly to the ground;
2543,(TERPSICHORE),"This light bolero grows a ticklish dance,"
2544,(TERPSICHORE),And there is mischief in thy kindling glance.
2545,(TERPSICHORE),"To-morrow bids thee, with rebuking frown,"
2546,(TERPSICHORE),"Change thy gauze tunic for a home-made gown,"
2547,(TERPSICHORE),Too blest by fortune if the passing day
2548,(TERPSICHORE),"Adorn thy bosom with its frail bouquet,"
2549,(TERPSICHORE),"But oh, still happier if the next forgets"
2550,(TERPSICHORE),Thy daring steps and dangerous pirouettes!
