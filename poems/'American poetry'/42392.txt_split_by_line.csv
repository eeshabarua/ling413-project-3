211,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
212,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"I have eaten grits and gravy in the Southland now and then,"
213,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,I have lived on California's luscious fruits;
214,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"I've inhaled long-stringed spaghetti in Italia, and again"
215,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,In the Klondike once I dined on cowhide boots.
216,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
217,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Of course I've supped at Rector's, at the Cecil, and the rest;"
218,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Tackled truffles and de foie gras in Paree;
219,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"I have bolted guava jelly and tortillas, Madrid's best,"

222,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"But of all the palate-ticklers on the whole world's bill of fare,"
223,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Whether ladled out at morning, night or noon,"
224,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Not a gustatory stimulant that I know can compare

230,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Just a little bit of taffy--presto! won!!
231,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Every married woman knows it--every girlie ought to know:
232,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,If you feed a man of taffy he's undone.
233,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
234,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"When a man tries introspection, then he stacks up mighty small;"
235,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,So he keeps from this self-searching all he can;
236,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Yet a feeling lies inherent, never's lost in him at all,"
237,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"That he'd like to be a bigger, better man."
238,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
239,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"So when other people tell him that he's bigger, nicer far,"

244,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"It's not Vanity that does it, but his Better Self you view"
245,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,As he smiles and purrs and pleases all he can.
246,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,As a corking good investment I would hand this tip to you:
247,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Just try always feeding taffy to a man.
248,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
249,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Do not stinge nor be too saving, don't conserve this priceless boon,"
250,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,But feed as though you had an endless store;
251,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"With an appetite voracious he will gulp it from the spoon,"
252,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,And when all's gone he'll loudly cry for more.

267,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"I have the foolish habit,"
268,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"That oft brings me disgrace,"
269,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Of cutting off my Roman nose

274,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Though cosmos out of chaos
275,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,It never makes at all.
276,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
277,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,I jump out of the skillet
278,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Into the fire that's hot;
279,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,With fingers burned I dread the blaze.
280,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,But quit it? I guess not!
281,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
282,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,And so goes on the battle

296,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
297,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
298,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,I sat me down in pride to gloat
299,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Upon the column that you wrote,"
300,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"In which you, sir, were pleased to quote"
301,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,From me and Riley--
302,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"From me and him,"
303,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"From me and Jim,"
304,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,From me and Riley.
305,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
306,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,The _tout ensemble_ did impel

309,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Me, you and Riley."
310,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,It seemed a great
311,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Triumvirate--
312,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"ME, YOU and RILEY."
313,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
314,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,But soon in deep humility
315,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"My head was bowed, and I could see"
316,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,The difference 'tween little ^{me}
317,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,And You and Riley.
318,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,I lacked the art
319,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,To touch the heart

321,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,

323,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Of cheerful mien, of birds and bees,"
324,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,And out-of-doorsy things one sees--

326,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"With master-stroke,"
327,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,To common folk
328,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Write you and Riley.
329,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
330,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,I take a hack-saw and a square

332,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"'Tis harder work for me, I swear,"
333,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Than you and Riley.
334,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,And yet I fail

337,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,
338,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,You write in prose--a rhymer he--
339,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,And yet 't has always seemed to me
340,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,Your souls alike must surely be--
341,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"Yours, sir, and Riley's."
342,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,You love each thing

354,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"I hate the Pollyanna cult! Cheeruptimistic lore, that now confronts at"

356,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"every thing I read, the sugar-coated life's prescribed as man's most"

358,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"just purr and sing the whole day long, then pass it on ahead! If grandma"

360,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"if you're broke, why, whistle as you beg! Now I, for one, refuse to live"
361,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"a grinning Cheshire cat. I'm just as human, mad as glad--a fool can tell"
362,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"you that. All sunshine makes a desert waste, and honey-words soon pall;"
363,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,because someone's in harder luck can't make me glad at all. A man has
364,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,special muscles just to corrugate his brow; the Lord knew when he
365,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"fashioned them that they'd be used, and how. I want my friends without"
366,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,"veneer, straightforward as can be; and I will grant them outlet for"
367,THE JUMBLE BOOK OF RHYMES,innate depravity. Why bluff and play that grief's not real? Why blush to
