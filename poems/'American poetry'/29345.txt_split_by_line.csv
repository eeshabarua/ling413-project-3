125,CHRISTMAS TREES,(_A Christmas Circular Letter_)
126,CHRISTMAS TREES,
127,CHRISTMAS TREES,
128,CHRISTMAS TREES,The city had withdrawn into itself
129,CHRISTMAS TREES,And left at last the country to the country;
130,CHRISTMAS TREES,When between whirls of snow not come to lie
131,CHRISTMAS TREES,"And whirls of foliage not yet laid, there drove"
132,CHRISTMAS TREES,"A stranger to our yard, who looked the city,"
133,CHRISTMAS TREES,Yet did in country fashion in that there
134,CHRISTMAS TREES,He sat and waited till he drew us out
135,CHRISTMAS TREES,A-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.
136,CHRISTMAS TREES,He proved to be the city come again
137,CHRISTMAS TREES,To look for something it had left behind
138,CHRISTMAS TREES,And could not do without and keep its Christmas.
139,CHRISTMAS TREES,He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;
140,CHRISTMAS TREES,My woods--the young fir balsams like a place
141,CHRISTMAS TREES,Where houses all are churches and have spires.
142,CHRISTMAS TREES,I hadn't thought of them as Christmas Trees.
143,CHRISTMAS TREES,I doubt if I was tempted for a moment
144,CHRISTMAS TREES,To sell them off their feet to go in cars
145,CHRISTMAS TREES,"And leave the slope behind the house all bare,"
146,CHRISTMAS TREES,Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.
147,CHRISTMAS TREES,I'd hate to have them know it if I was.
148,CHRISTMAS TREES,Yet more I'd hate to hold my trees except
149,CHRISTMAS TREES,"As others hold theirs or refuse for them,"
150,CHRISTMAS TREES,"Beyond the time of profitable growth,"
151,CHRISTMAS TREES,The trial by market everything must come to.
152,CHRISTMAS TREES,I dallied so much with the thought of selling.
153,CHRISTMAS TREES,Then whether from mistaken courtesy
154,CHRISTMAS TREES,"And fear of seeming short of speech, or whether"
155,CHRISTMAS TREES,"From hope of hearing good of what was mine,"
156,CHRISTMAS TREES,"I said, ""There aren't enough to be worth while."""
157,CHRISTMAS TREES,"""I could soon tell how many they would cut,"
158,CHRISTMAS TREES,"You let me look them over."""
159,CHRISTMAS TREES,
160,CHRISTMAS TREES,"""You could look."
161,CHRISTMAS TREES,"But don't expect I'm going to let you have them."""
162,CHRISTMAS TREES,"Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too close"
163,CHRISTMAS TREES,"That lop each other of boughs, but not a few"
164,CHRISTMAS TREES,Quite solitary and having equal boughs
165,CHRISTMAS TREES,"All round and round. The latter he nodded ""Yes"" to,"
166,CHRISTMAS TREES,"Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,"
167,CHRISTMAS TREES,"With a buyer's moderation, ""That would do."""
168,CHRISTMAS TREES,"I thought so too, but wasn't there to say so."
169,CHRISTMAS TREES,"We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,"
170,CHRISTMAS TREES,And came down on the north.
171,CHRISTMAS TREES,
172,CHRISTMAS TREES,"He said, ""A thousand."""
173,CHRISTMAS TREES,
174,CHRISTMAS TREES,"""A thousand Christmas trees!--at what apiece?"""
175,CHRISTMAS TREES,
176,CHRISTMAS TREES,He felt some need of softening that to me:
177,CHRISTMAS TREES,"""A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars."""
178,CHRISTMAS TREES,
179,CHRISTMAS TREES,Then I was certain I had never meant
180,CHRISTMAS TREES,To let him have them. Never show surprise!
181,CHRISTMAS TREES,But thirty dollars seemed so small beside
182,CHRISTMAS TREES,"The extent of pasture I should strip, three cents"
183,CHRISTMAS TREES,"(For that was all they figured out apiece),"
184,CHRISTMAS TREES,Three cents so small beside the dollar friends
185,CHRISTMAS TREES,I should be writing to within the hour
186,CHRISTMAS TREES,"Would pay in cities for good trees like those,"
187,CHRISTMAS TREES,Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday Schools
188,CHRISTMAS TREES,Could hang enough on to pick off enough.
189,CHRISTMAS TREES,A thousand Christmas trees I didn't know I had!
190,CHRISTMAS TREES,"Worth three cents more to give away than sell,"
191,CHRISTMAS TREES,As may be shown by a simple calculation.
192,CHRISTMAS TREES,Too bad I couldn't lay one in a letter.
193,CHRISTMAS TREES,"I can't help wishing I could send you one,"
194,CHRISTMAS TREES,In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.

200,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,
201,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,
202,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,All out of doors looked darkly in at him
203,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,"
204,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.
205,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
206,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.
207,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,What kept him from remembering what it was
208,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,That brought him to that creaking room was age.
209,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,He stood with barrels round him--at a loss.
210,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,And having scared the cellar under him
211,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"In clomping there, he scared it once again"
212,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"In clomping off;--and scared the outer night,"
213,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
214,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Of trees and crack of branches, common things,"
215,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,But nothing so like beating on a box.
216,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,A light he was to no one but himself
217,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
218,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"A quiet light, and then not even that."
219,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"He consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
220,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"So late-arising, to the broken moon"
221,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,As better than the sun in any case
222,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
223,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,His icicles along the wall to keep;
224,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt
225,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,"
226,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept."
227,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"One aged man--one man--can't fill a house,"
228,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,"A farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
229,AN OLD MAN'S WINTER NIGHT,It's thus he does it of a winter night.

239,A PATCH OF OLD SNOW,Was a blow-away paper the rain
240,A PATCH OF OLD SNOW,Had brought to rest.
241,A PATCH OF OLD SNOW,
242,A PATCH OF OLD SNOW,It is speckled with grime as if
243,A PATCH OF OLD SNOW,"Small print overspread it,"

255,IN THE HOME STRETCH,At weeds the water from the sink made tall.
256,IN THE HOME STRETCH,She wore her cape; her hat was in her hand.
257,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Behind her was confusion in the room,"
258,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Of chairs turned upside down to sit like people
259,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"In other chairs, and something, come to look,"
260,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"For every room a house has--parlor, bed-room,"
261,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And dining-room--thrown pell-mell in the kitchen.
262,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"And now and then a smudged, infernal face"
263,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Looked in a door behind her and addressed
264,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Her back. She always answered without turning.
265,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
266,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Where will I put this walnut bureau, lady?"""
267,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Put it on top of something that's on top"
268,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Of something else,"" she laughed. ""Oh, put it where"
269,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"You can to-night, and go. It's almost dark;"
270,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"You must be getting started back to town."""
271,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Another blackened face thrust in and looked
272,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"And smiled, and when she did not turn, spoke gently,"
273,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""What are you seeing out the window, _lady_?"""
274,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
275,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Never was I beladied so before."
276,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Would evidence of having been called lady
277,IN THE HOME STRETCH,More than so many times make me a lady
278,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"In common law, I wonder."""
279,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
280,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""But I ask,"
281,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"What are you seeing out the window, lady?"""
282,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
283,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""What I'll be seeing more of in the years"

289,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Rank weeds that love the water from the dish-pan"
290,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"More than some women like the dish-pan, Joe;"
291,IN THE HOME STRETCH,A little stretch of mowing-field for you;
292,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Not much of that until I come to woods
293,IN THE HOME STRETCH,That end all. And it's scarce enough to call
294,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"A view."""
295,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
296,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""And yet you think you like it, dear?"""
297,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
298,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""That's what you're so concerned to know! You hope"
299,IN THE HOME STRETCH,I like it. Bang goes something big away
300,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Off there upstairs. The very tread of men
301,IN THE HOME STRETCH,As great as those is shattering to the frame
302,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Of such a little house. Once left alone,"
303,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"You and I, dear, will go with softer steps"
304,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Up and down stairs and through the rooms, and none"
305,IN THE HOME STRETCH,But sudden winds that snatch them from our hands
306,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Will ever slam the doors."""

311,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""No; for besides the things I tell you of,"

315,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
316,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""What kind of years?"""
317,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Why, latter years--"

319,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""I see them, too."
320,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"You didn't count them?"""
321,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""No, the further off"
322,IN THE HOME STRETCH,So ran together that I didn't try to.
323,IN THE HOME STRETCH,It can scarce be that they would be in number
324,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"We'd care to know, for we are not young now."
325,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And bang goes something else away off there.
326,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"It sounds as if it were the men went down,"
327,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And every crash meant one less to return
328,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"To lighted city streets we, too, have known,"
329,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"But now are giving up for country darkness."""
330,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
331,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Come from that window where you see too much for me,"
332,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And take a livelier view of things from here.
333,IN THE HOME STRETCH,They're going. Watch this husky swarming up
334,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Over the wheel into the sky-high seat,"
335,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Lighting his pipe now, squinting down his nose"
336,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"At the flame burning downward as he sucks it."""
337,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
338,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""See how it makes his nose-side bright, a proof"
339,IN THE HOME STRETCH,How dark it's getting. Can you tell what time
340,IN THE HOME STRETCH,It is by that? Or by the moon? The new moon!
341,IN THE HOME STRETCH,What shoulder did I see her over? Neither.
342,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"A wire she is of silver, as new as we"
343,IN THE HOME STRETCH,To everything. Her light won't last us long.
344,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"It's something, though, to know we're going to have her"
345,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Night after night and stronger every night
346,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"To see us through our first two weeks. But, Joe,"
347,IN THE HOME STRETCH,The stove! Before they go! Knock on the window;
348,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Ask them to help you get it on its feet.
349,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"We stand here dreaming. Hurry! Call them back!"""

353,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""We've got to have the stove,"

357,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Again
358,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"The house was full of tramping, and the dark,"
359,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.
360,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,"
361,IN THE HOME STRETCH,To which they set it true by eye; and then
362,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,"
363,IN THE HOME STRETCH,So much too light and airy for their strength
364,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"It almost seemed to come ballooning up,"
365,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.
366,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""A fit!"" said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder."
367,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""It's good luck when you move in to begin"
368,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,"

370,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"When people're getting on in life. You'll like it."""
371,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Joe said: ""You big boys ought to find a farm,"
372,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"And make good farmers, and leave other fellows"
373,IN THE HOME STRETCH,The city work to do. There's not enough
374,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"For everybody as it is in there."""
375,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""God!"" one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:"
376,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Say that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm."""
377,IN THE HOME STRETCH,But Jimmy only made his jaw recede
378,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say"
379,IN THE HOME STRETCH,He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy
380,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,"
381,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Ma friend, you ain't know what it is you're ask."""
382,IN THE HOME STRETCH,He doffed his cap and held it with both hands
383,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Across his chest to make as 'twere a bow:
384,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""We're giving you our chances on de farm."""
385,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And then they all turned to with deafening boots
386,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And put each other bodily out of the house.
387,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Goodby to them! We puzzle them. They think--"
388,IN THE HOME STRETCH,I don't know what they think we see in what
389,IN THE HOME STRETCH,They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems
390,IN THE HOME STRETCH,The back some farm presents us; and your woods
391,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"To northward from your window at the sink,"
392,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Waiting to steal a step on us whenever
393,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"We drop our eyes or turn to other things,"
394,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"As in the game 'Ten-step' the children play."""
395,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
396,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Good boys they seemed, and let them love the city."
397,IN THE HOME STRETCH,All they could say was 'God!' when you proposed

399,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
400,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""Did they make something lonesome go through you?"
401,IN THE HOME STRETCH,It would take more than them to sicken you--
402,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Us of our bargain. But they left us so
403,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with."
404,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"They almost shook _me_."""
405,IN THE HOME STRETCH,
406,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"""It's all so much"

410,IN THE HOME STRETCH,It's nothing; it's their leaving us at dusk.
411,IN THE HOME STRETCH,I never bore it well when people went.
412,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"The first night after guests have gone, the house"
413,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Seems haunted or exposed. I always take
414,IN THE HOME STRETCH,A personal interest in the locking up
415,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off."""
416,IN THE HOME STRETCH,He fetched a dingy lantern from behind
417,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"A door. ""There's that we didn't lose! And these!""--"
418,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Some matches he unpocketed. ""For food--"
419,IN THE HOME STRETCH,The meals we've had no one can take from us.

434,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"He'll know what he would do if he were we,"
435,IN THE HOME STRETCH,And all at once. He'll plan for us and plan
436,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"To help us, but he'll take it out in planning."
437,IN THE HOME STRETCH,"Well, you can set the table with the loaf."
438,IN THE HOME STRETCH,Let's see you find your loaf. I'll light the fire.

647,BIRCHES,
648,BIRCHES,When I see birches bend to left and right
649,BIRCHES,"Across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
650,BIRCHES,I like to think some boy's been swinging them.
651,BIRCHES,But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.
652,BIRCHES,Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them
653,BIRCHES,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
654,BIRCHES,After a rain. They click upon themselves
655,BIRCHES,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
656,BIRCHES,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.
657,BIRCHES,Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
658,BIRCHES,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust--
659,BIRCHES,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
660,BIRCHES,You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.
661,BIRCHES,"They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
662,BIRCHES,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
663,BIRCHES,"So low for long, they never right themselves:"
664,BIRCHES,You may see their trunks arching in the woods
665,BIRCHES,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
666,BIRCHES,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
667,BIRCHES,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.
668,BIRCHES,But I was going to say when Truth broke in
669,BIRCHES,With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
670,BIRCHES,(Now am I free to be poetical?)
671,BIRCHES,I should prefer to have some boy bend them
672,BIRCHES,As he went out and in to fetch the cows--
673,BIRCHES,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
674,BIRCHES,"Whose only play was what he found himself,"
675,BIRCHES,"Summer or winter, and could play alone."
676,BIRCHES,One by one he subdued his father's trees
677,BIRCHES,By riding them down over and over again
678,BIRCHES,"Until he took the stiffness out of them,"
679,BIRCHES,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left"
680,BIRCHES,For him to conquer. He learned all there was
681,BIRCHES,To learn about not launching out too soon
682,BIRCHES,And so not carrying the tree away
683,BIRCHES,Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise
684,BIRCHES,"To the top branches, climbing carefully"
685,BIRCHES,With the same pains you use to fill a cup
686,BIRCHES,"Up to the brim, and even above the brim."
687,BIRCHES,"Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
688,BIRCHES,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.
689,BIRCHES,So was I once myself a swinger of birches.
690,BIRCHES,And so I dream of going back to be.
691,BIRCHES,"It's when I'm weary of considerations,"
692,BIRCHES,And life is too much like a pathless wood
693,BIRCHES,Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
694,BIRCHES,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
695,BIRCHES,From a twig's having lashed across it open.
696,BIRCHES,I'd like to get away from earth awhile
697,BIRCHES,And then come back to it and begin over.
698,BIRCHES,May no fate willfully misunderstand me
699,BIRCHES,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away
700,BIRCHES,Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:
701,BIRCHES,I don't know where it's likely to go better.
702,BIRCHES,"I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
703,BIRCHES,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
704,BIRCHES,"_Toward_ heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
705,BIRCHES,But dipped its top and set me down again.
706,BIRCHES,That would be good both going and coming back.
707,BIRCHES,One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.

735,PEA BRUSH,They might be good for garden things
736,PEA BRUSH,"To curl a little finger round,"
737,PEA BRUSH,"The same as you seize cat's-cradle strings,"
738,PEA BRUSH,And lift themselves up off the ground.
739,PEA BRUSH,
740,PEA BRUSH,"Small good to anything growing wild,"
741,PEA BRUSH,They were crooking many a trillium
742,PEA BRUSH,That had budded before the boughs were piled
743,PEA BRUSH,And since it was coming up had to come.

1005,THE BONFIRE,Done so much and I know not how much more
1006,THE BONFIRE,I mean it shall not do if I can bind it.
1007,THE BONFIRE,Well if it doesn't with its draft bring on
1008,THE BONFIRE,"A wind to blow in earnest from some quarter,"
1009,THE BONFIRE,As once it did with me upon an April.
1010,THE BONFIRE,The breezes were so spent with winter blowing
1011,THE BONFIRE,They seemed to fail the bluebirds under them
1012,THE BONFIRE,Short of the perch their languid flight was toward;
1013,THE BONFIRE,And my flame made a pinnacle to heaven
1014,THE BONFIRE,As I walked once round it in possession.
1015,THE BONFIRE,But the wind out of doors--you know the saying.
1016,THE BONFIRE,There came a gust. You used to think the trees
1017,THE BONFIRE,Made wind by fanning since you never knew
1018,THE BONFIRE,It blow but that you saw the trees in motion.
1019,THE BONFIRE,Something or someone watching made that gust.
1020,THE BONFIRE,It put the flame tip-down and dabbed the grass
1021,THE BONFIRE,Of over-winter with the least tip-touch
1022,THE BONFIRE,Your tongue gives salt or sugar in your hand.
1023,THE BONFIRE,The place it reached to blackened instantly.
1024,THE BONFIRE,"The black was all there was by day-light,"
1025,THE BONFIRE,That and the merest curl of cigarette smoke--
1026,THE BONFIRE,"And a flame slender as the hepaticas,"
1027,THE BONFIRE,"Blood-root, and violets so soon to be now."
1028,THE BONFIRE,"But the black spread like black death on the ground,"
1029,THE BONFIRE,And I think the sky darkened with a cloud
1030,THE BONFIRE,Like winter and evening coming on together.
1031,THE BONFIRE,There were enough things to be thought of then.
1032,THE BONFIRE,Where the field stretches toward the north
1033,THE BONFIRE,"And setting sun to Hyla brook, I gave it"
1034,THE BONFIRE,"To flames without twice thinking, where it verges"
1035,THE BONFIRE,"Upon the road, to flames too, though in fear"
1036,THE BONFIRE,"They might find fuel there, in withered brake,"
1037,THE BONFIRE,"Grass its full length, old silver golden-rod,"
1038,THE BONFIRE,"And alder and grape vine entanglement,"
1039,THE BONFIRE,To leap the dusty deadline. For my own
1040,THE BONFIRE,I took what front there was beside. I knelt
1041,THE BONFIRE,And thrust hands in and held my face away.
1042,THE BONFIRE,Fight such a fire by rubbing not by beating.
1043,THE BONFIRE,A board is the best weapon if you have it.
1044,THE BONFIRE,"I had my coat. And oh, I knew, I knew,"
1045,THE BONFIRE,"And said out loud, I couldn't bide the smother"
1046,THE BONFIRE,And heat so close in; but the thought of all
1047,THE BONFIRE,"The woods and town on fire by me, and all"
1048,THE BONFIRE,The town turned out to fight for me--that held me.
1049,THE BONFIRE,"I trusted the brook barrier, but feared"
1050,THE BONFIRE,The road would fail; and on that side the fire
1051,THE BONFIRE,Died not without a noise of crackling wood--
1052,THE BONFIRE,Of something more than tinder-grass and weed--
1053,THE BONFIRE,That brought me to my feet to hold it back
1054,THE BONFIRE,"By leaning back myself, as if the reins"
1055,THE BONFIRE,Were round my neck and I was at the plough.
1056,THE BONFIRE,I won! But I'm sure no one ever spread
1057,THE BONFIRE,Another color over a tenth the space
1058,THE BONFIRE,That I spread coal-black over in the time
1059,THE BONFIRE,It took me. Neighbors coming home from town
1060,THE BONFIRE,Couldn't believe that so much black had come there
1061,THE BONFIRE,"While they had backs turned, that it hadn't been there"
1062,THE BONFIRE,When they had passed an hour or so before
1063,THE BONFIRE,Going the other way and they not seen it.
1064,THE BONFIRE,They looked about for someone to have done it.
1065,THE BONFIRE,But there was no one. I was somewhere wondering
1066,THE BONFIRE,Where all my weariness had gone and why
1067,THE BONFIRE,I walked so light on air in heavy shoes
1068,THE BONFIRE,In spite of a scorched Fourth-of-July feeling.
1069,THE BONFIRE,"Why wouldn't I be scared remembering that?"""
1070,THE BONFIRE,
1071,THE BONFIRE,"""If it scares you, what will it do to us?"""
1072,THE BONFIRE,

1124,A GIRL'S GARDEN,But she don't mind now.
1125,A GIRL'S GARDEN,
1126,A GIRL'S GARDEN,She wheeled the dung in the wheelbarrow

1130,A GIRL'S GARDEN,
1131,A GIRL'S GARDEN,And hid from anyone passing.
1132,A GIRL'S GARDEN,And then she begged the seed.

1170,THE EXPOSED NEST,"Trying, I thought, to set it up on end,"
1171,THE EXPOSED NEST,"I went to show you how to make it stay,"

1177,THE EXPOSED NEST,"Though I found your hand full of wilted fern,"
1178,THE EXPOSED NEST,"Steel-bright June-grass, and blackening heads of clover."
1179,THE EXPOSED NEST,'Twas a nest full of young birds on the ground
1180,THE EXPOSED NEST,The cutter-bar had just gone champing over
1181,THE EXPOSED NEST,(Miraculously without tasting flesh)
1182,THE EXPOSED NEST,And left defenseless to the heat and light.
1183,THE EXPOSED NEST,You wanted to restore them to their right

1186,THE EXPOSED NEST,The way the nest-full every time we stirred
1187,THE EXPOSED NEST,Stood up to us as to a mother-bird
1188,THE EXPOSED NEST,"Whose coming home has been too long deferred,"
1189,THE EXPOSED NEST,Made me ask would the mother-bird return
1190,THE EXPOSED NEST,And care for them in such a change of scene

1194,THE EXPOSED NEST,But dared not spare to do the best we could
1195,THE EXPOSED NEST,Though harm should come of it; so built the screen

1197,THE EXPOSED NEST,All this to prove we cared. Why is there then
1198,THE EXPOSED NEST,No more to tell? We turned to other things.

1254,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1255,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Brown lived at such a lofty farm
1256,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,That everyone for miles could see
1257,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,His lantern when he did his chores
1258,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,In winter after half-past three.
1259,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1260,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,And many must have seen him make

1262,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,"
1263,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Describing rings of lantern light.
1264,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1265,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Between the house and barn the gale
1266,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Got him by something he had on

1273,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,But though repeatedly he strove
1274,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1275,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"And stamped and said things to himself,"
1276,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"And sometimes something seemed to yield,"
1277,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"He gained no foothold, but pursued"
1278,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,His journey down from field to field.
1279,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1280,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Sometimes he came with arms outspread
1281,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Like wings, revolving in the scene"
1282,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Upon his longer axis, and"
1283,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,With no small dignity of mien.
1284,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1285,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Faster or slower as he chanced,"
1286,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Sitting or standing as he chose,"
1287,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,According as he feared to risk
1288,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,"
1289,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1290,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,He never let the lantern drop.

1299,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1300,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;"
1301,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,He fell and made the lantern rattle

1304,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1305,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Incredulous of his own bad luck.
1306,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,And then becoming reconciled

1309,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1310,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"""Well--I--be--"" that was all he said,"
1311,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"As standing in the river road,"

1314,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1315,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Sometimes as an authority
1316,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"On motor-cars, I'm asked if I"
1317,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Should say our stock was petered out,"
1318,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,And this is my sincere reply:
1319,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1320,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Yankees are what they always were.
1321,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Don't think Brown ever gave up hope
1322,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Of getting home again because
1323,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,He couldn't climb that slippery slope;
1324,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1325,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Or even thought of standing there
1326,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Until the January thaw
1327,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,Should take the polish off the crust.
1328,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"He bowed with grace to natural law,"
1329,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1330,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"And then went round it on his feet,"
1331,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,After the manner of our stock;
1332,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Not much concerned for those to whom,"
1333,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"At that particular time o'clock,"
1334,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1335,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,It must have looked as if the course
1336,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,He steered was really straight away

1338,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,"Not much concerned for them, I say;"

1344,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,
1345,THE WILLY-NILLY SLIDE,But now he snapped his eyes three times;

1358,THE GUM-GATHERER,And set me five miles on my road
1359,THE GUM-GATHERER,"Better than if he had had me ride,"
1360,THE GUM-GATHERER,A man with a swinging bag for load
1361,THE GUM-GATHERER,And half the bag wound round his hand.
1362,THE GUM-GATHERER,We talked like barking above the din
1363,THE GUM-GATHERER,Of water we walked along beside.
1364,THE GUM-GATHERER,And for my telling him where I'd been
1365,THE GUM-GATHERER,And where I lived in mountain land
1366,THE GUM-GATHERER,"To be coming home the way I was,"
1367,THE GUM-GATHERER,He told me a little about himself.
1368,THE GUM-GATHERER,He came from higher up in the pass
1369,THE GUM-GATHERER,Where the grist of the new-beginning brooks
1370,THE GUM-GATHERER,Is blocks split off the mountain mass--
1371,THE GUM-GATHERER,And hopeless grist enough it looks
1372,THE GUM-GATHERER,Ever to grind to soil for grass.
1373,THE GUM-GATHERER,(The way it is will do for moss.)
1374,THE GUM-GATHERER,There he had built his stolen shack.
1375,THE GUM-GATHERER,It had to be a stolen shack
1376,THE GUM-GATHERER,Because of the fears of fire and loss
1377,THE GUM-GATHERER,That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:
1378,THE GUM-GATHERER,Visions of half the world burned black
1379,THE GUM-GATHERER,And the sun shrunken yellow in smoke.
1380,THE GUM-GATHERER,We know who when they come to town
1381,THE GUM-GATHERER,"Bring berries under the wagon seat,"
1382,THE GUM-GATHERER,Or a basket of eggs between their feet;
1383,THE GUM-GATHERER,What this man brought in a cotton sack
1384,THE GUM-GATHERER,"Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce."
1385,THE GUM-GATHERER,He showed me lumps of the scented stuff
1386,THE GUM-GATHERER,"Like uncut jewels, dull and rough."
1387,THE GUM-GATHERER,It comes to market golden brown;
1388,THE GUM-GATHERER,But turns to pink between the teeth.
1389,THE GUM-GATHERER,
1390,THE GUM-GATHERER,I told him this is a pleasant life
1391,THE GUM-GATHERER,To set your breast to the bark of trees
1392,THE GUM-GATHERER,"That all your days are dim beneath,"
1393,THE GUM-GATHERER,"And reaching up with a little knife,"
1394,THE GUM-GATHERER,To loose the resin and take it down
1395,THE GUM-GATHERER,And bring it to market when you please.

1409,THE LINE-GANG,Will run as hushed as when they were a thought.
1410,THE LINE-GANG,But in no hush they string it: they go past

1413,THE LINE-GANG,"To ease away--they have it. With a laugh,"

1447,THE VANISHING RED,"Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails."
1448,THE VANISHING RED,Then he shut down the trap door with a ring in it
1449,THE VANISHING RED,"That jangled even above the general noise,"
1450,THE VANISHING RED,"And came up stairs alone--and gave that laugh,"
1451,THE VANISHING RED,And said something to a man with a meal-sack
1452,THE VANISHING RED,That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then.
1453,THE VANISHING RED,"Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel pit all right."

1460,SNOW,
1461,SNOW,The three stood listening to a fresh access
1462,SNOW,"Of wind that caught against the house a moment,"
1463,SNOW,"Gulped snow, and then blew free again--the Coles"
1464,SNOW,"Dressed, but dishevelled from some hours of sleep,"
1465,SNOW,Meserve belittled in the great skin coat he wore.
1466,SNOW,
1467,SNOW,Meserve was first to speak. He pointed backward
1468,SNOW,"Over his shoulder with his pipe-stem, saying,"
1469,SNOW,"""You can just see it glancing off the roof"
1470,SNOW,"Making a great scroll upward toward the sky,"
1471,SNOW,Long enough for recording all our names on.--
1472,SNOW,I think I'll just call up my wife and tell her
1473,SNOW,I'm here--so far--and starting on again.
1474,SNOW,I'll call her softly so that if she's wise
1475,SNOW,"And gone to sleep, she needn't wake to answer."""
1476,SNOW,"Three times he barely stirred the bell, then listened."
1477,SNOW,"""Why, Lett, still up? Lett, I'm at Cole's. I'm late."
1478,SNOW,I called you up to say Good-night from here
1479,SNOW,Before I went to say Good-morning there.--
1480,SNOW,"I thought I would.--I know, but, Lett--I know--"
1481,SNOW,"I could, but what's the sense? The rest won't be"
1482,SNOW,"So bad.--Give me an hour for it.--Ho, ho,"
1483,SNOW,Three hours to here! But that was all up hill;
1484,SNOW,"The rest is down.--Why no, no, not a wallow:"
1485,SNOW,They kept their heads and took their time to it
1486,SNOW,"Like darlings, both of them. They're in the barn.--"
1487,SNOW,"My dear, I'm coming just the same. I didn't"
1488,SNOW,"Call you to ask you to invite me home.--"""
1489,SNOW,"He lingered for some word she wouldn't say,"
1490,SNOW,"Said it at last himself, ""Good-night,"" and then,"
1491,SNOW,"Getting no answer, closed the telephone."
1492,SNOW,The three stood in the lamplight round the table
1493,SNOW,"With lowered eyes a moment till he said,"
1494,SNOW,"""I'll just see how the horses are."""
1495,SNOW,
1496,SNOW,"""Yes, do,"""
1497,SNOW,Both the Coles said together. Mrs. Cole
1498,SNOW,"Added: ""You can judge better after seeing.--"
1499,SNOW,"I want you here with me, Fred. Leave him here,"
1500,SNOW,Brother Meserve. You know to find your way
1501,SNOW,"Out through the shed."""
1502,SNOW,
1503,SNOW,"""I guess I know my way,"
1504,SNOW,I guess I know where I can find my name
1505,SNOW,Carved in the shed to tell me who I am
1506,SNOW,If it don't tell me where I am. I used
1507,SNOW,"To play--"""
1508,SNOW,
1509,SNOW,"""You tend your horses and come back."
1510,SNOW,"Fred Cole, you're going to let him!"""
1511,SNOW,
1512,SNOW,"""Well, aren't you?"
1513,SNOW,"How can you help yourself?"""
1514,SNOW,
1515,SNOW,"""I called him Brother."
1516,SNOW,"Why did I call him that?"""
1517,SNOW,
1518,SNOW,"""It's right enough."
1519,SNOW,That's all you ever heard him called round here.
1520,SNOW,"He seems to have lost off his Christian name."""
1521,SNOW,
1522,SNOW,"""Christian enough I should call that myself."
1523,SNOW,"He took no notice, did he? Well, at least"
1524,SNOW,"I didn't use it out of love of him,"
1525,SNOW,The dear knows. I detest the thought of him
1526,SNOW,With his ten children under ten years old.
1527,SNOW,"I hate his wretched little Racker Sect,"
1528,SNOW,"All's ever I heard of it, which isn't much."
1529,SNOW,"But that's not saying--Look, Fred Cole, it's twelve,"
1530,SNOW,"Isn't it, now? He's been here half an hour."
1531,SNOW,He says he left the village store at nine.
1532,SNOW,Three hours to do four miles--a mile an hour
1533,SNOW,"Or not much better. Why, it doesn't seem"
1534,SNOW,As if a man could move that slow and move.
1535,SNOW,Try to think what he did with all that time.
1536,SNOW,"And three miles more to go!"""
1537,SNOW,
1538,SNOW,"""Don't let him go."
1539,SNOW,"Stick to him, Helen. Make him answer you."
1540,SNOW,That sort of man talks straight on all his life
1541,SNOW,"From the last thing he said himself, stone deaf"
1542,SNOW,To anything anyone else may say.
1543,SNOW,"I should have thought, though, you could make him hear you."""
1544,SNOW,
1545,SNOW,"""What is he doing out a night like this?"
1546,SNOW,"Why can't he stay at home?"""
1547,SNOW,
1548,SNOW,"""He had to preach."""
1549,SNOW,
1550,SNOW,"""It's no night to be out."""
1551,SNOW,
1552,SNOW,"""He may be small,"
1553,SNOW,"He may be good, but one thing's sure, he's tough."""
1554,SNOW,
1555,SNOW,"""And strong of stale tobacco."""
1556,SNOW,
1557,SNOW,"""He'll pull through."""
1558,SNOW,
1559,SNOW,"""You only say so. Not another house"
1560,SNOW,Or shelter to put into from this place
1561,SNOW,"To theirs. I'm going to call his wife again."""
1562,SNOW,
1563,SNOW,"""Wait and he may. Let's see what he will do."
1564,SNOW,Let's see if he will think of her again.
1565,SNOW,But then I doubt he's thinking of himself
1566,SNOW,"He doesn't look on it as anything."""
1567,SNOW,
1568,SNOW,"""He shan't go--there!"""
1569,SNOW,
1570,SNOW,"""It _is_ a night, my dear."""
1571,SNOW,
1572,SNOW,"""One thing: he didn't drag God into it."""
1573,SNOW,
1574,SNOW,"""He don't consider it a case for God."""
1575,SNOW,
1576,SNOW,"""You think so, do you? You don't know the kind."
1577,SNOW,He's getting up a miracle this minute.
1578,SNOW,"Privately--to himself, right now, he's thinking"
1579,SNOW,"He'll make a case of it if he succeeds,"
1580,SNOW,"But keep still if he fails."""
1581,SNOW,
1582,SNOW,"""Keep still all over."
1583,SNOW,"He'll be dead--dead and buried."""
1584,SNOW,
1585,SNOW,"""Such a trouble!"
1586,SNOW,Not but I've every reason not to care
1587,SNOW,What happens to him if it only takes
1588,SNOW,Some of the sanctimonious conceit
1589,SNOW,"Out of one of those pious scalawags."""
1590,SNOW,
1591,SNOW,"""Nonsense to that! You want to see him safe."""
1592,SNOW,
1593,SNOW,"""You like the runt."""
1594,SNOW,
1595,SNOW,"""Don't you a little?"""
1596,SNOW,
1597,SNOW,"""Well,"
1598,SNOW,"I don't like what he's doing, which is what"
1599,SNOW,"You like, and like him for."""
1600,SNOW,
1601,SNOW,"""Oh, yes you do."
1602,SNOW,You like your fun as well as anyone;
1603,SNOW,Only you women have to put these airs on
1604,SNOW,To impress men. You've got us so ashamed
1605,SNOW,Of being men we can't look at a good fight
1606,SNOW,Between two boys and not feel bound to stop it.
1607,SNOW,"Let the man freeze an ear or two, I say.--"
1608,SNOW,He's here. I leave him all to you. Go in
1609,SNOW,"And save his life.--All right, come in, Meserve."
1610,SNOW,"Sit down, sit down. How did you find the horses?"""
1611,SNOW,
1612,SNOW,"""Fine, fine."""
1613,SNOW,
1614,SNOW,"""And ready for some more? My wife here"
1615,SNOW,"Says it won't do. You've got to give it up."""
1616,SNOW,
1617,SNOW,"""Won't you to please me? Please! If I say please?"
1618,SNOW,"Mr. Meserve, I'll leave it to _your_ wife."
1619,SNOW,"What _did_ your wife say on the telephone?"""
1620,SNOW,
1621,SNOW,Meserve seemed to heed nothing but the lamp
1622,SNOW,Or something not far from it on the table.
1623,SNOW,"By straightening out and lifting a forefinger,"
1624,SNOW,He pointed with his hand from where it lay
1625,SNOW,Like a white crumpled spider on his knee:
1626,SNOW,"""That leaf there in your open book! It moved"
1627,SNOW,"Just then, I thought. It's stood erect like that,"
1628,SNOW,"There on the table, ever since I came,"
1629,SNOW,"Trying to turn itself backward or forward,"
1630,SNOW,I've had my eye on it to make out which;
1631,SNOW,"If forward, then it's with a friend's impatience--"
1632,SNOW,You see I know--to get you on to things
1633,SNOW,"It wants to see how you will take, if backward"
1634,SNOW,It's from regret for something you have passed
1635,SNOW,"And failed to see the good of. Never mind,"
1636,SNOW,Things must expect to come in front of us
1637,SNOW,A many times--I don't say just how many--
1638,SNOW,That varies with the things--before we see them.
1639,SNOW,One of the lies would make it out that nothing
1640,SNOW,Ever presents itself before us twice.
1641,SNOW,Where would we be at last if that were so?
1642,SNOW,Our very life depends on everything's
1643,SNOW,Recurring till we answer from within.
1644,SNOW,The thousandth time may prove the charm.--That leaf!
1645,SNOW,It can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.
1646,SNOW,But the wind didn't move it if it moved.
1647,SNOW,It moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.
1648,SNOW,It couldn't stir so sensitively poised
1649,SNOW,A thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp
1650,SNOW,"To get a puff of black smoke from the flame,"
1651,SNOW,Or blow a rumple in the collie's coat.
1652,SNOW,"You make a little foursquare block of air,"
1653,SNOW,"Quiet and light and warm, in spite of all"
1654,SNOW,"The illimitable dark and cold and storm,"
1655,SNOW,"And by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,"
1656,SNOW,"And book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;"
1657,SNOW,"Though for all anyone can tell, repose"
1658,SNOW,"May be the thing you haven't, yet you give it."
1659,SNOW,So false it is that what we haven't we can't give;
1660,SNOW,"So false, that what we always say is true."
1661,SNOW,I'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.
1662,SNOW,"It won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?"""
1663,SNOW,
1664,SNOW,"""I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,"
1665,SNOW,"But if you're going--Say you'll stay, you know?"
1666,SNOW,"But let me raise this curtain on a scene,"
1667,SNOW,And show you how it's piling up against you.
1668,SNOW,You see the snow-white through the white of frost?
1669,SNOW,Ask Helen how far up the sash it's climbed
1670,SNOW,"Since last we read the gage."""
1671,SNOW,
1672,SNOW,"""It looks as if"
1673,SNOW,Some pallid thing had squashed its features flat
1674,SNOW,And its eyes shut with overeagerness
1675,SNOW,To see what people found so interesting
1676,SNOW,"In one another, and had gone to sleep"
1677,SNOW,"Of its own stupid lack of understanding,"
1678,SNOW,Or broken its white neck of mushroom stuff
1679,SNOW,"Short off, and died against the window-pane."""
1680,SNOW,
1681,SNOW,"""Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself"
1682,SNOW,More than you will us with such nightmare talk.
1683,SNOW,"It's you it matters to, because it's you"
1684,SNOW,"Who have to go out into it alone."""
1685,SNOW,
1686,SNOW,"""Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay."""
1687,SNOW,
1688,SNOW,"""Before you drop the curtain--I'm reminded:"
1689,SNOW,You recollect the boy who came out here
1690,SNOW,To breathe the air one winter--had a room
1691,SNOW,"Down at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning"
1692,SNOW,"After a downy storm, he passed our place"
1693,SNOW,And found me banking up the house with snow.
1694,SNOW,"And I was burrowing in deep for warmth,"
1695,SNOW,Piling it well above the window-sills.
1696,SNOW,The snow against the window caught his eye.
1697,SNOW,"'Hey, that's a pretty thought'--those were his words."
1698,SNOW,"'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,"
1699,SNOW,While you sit warm and read up balanced rations.
1700,SNOW,You can't get too much winter in the winter.'
1701,SNOW,Those were his words. And he went home and all
1702,SNOW,But banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.
1703,SNOW,Now you and I would go to no such length.
1704,SNOW,At the same time you can't deny it makes
1705,SNOW,"It not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,"
1706,SNOW,"Playing our fancy, to have the snowline run"
1707,SNOW,So high across the pane outside. There where
1708,SNOW,There is a sort of tunnel in the frost
1709,SNOW,More like a tunnel than a hole--way down
1710,SNOW,At the far end of it you see a stir
1711,SNOW,And quiver like the frayed edge of the drift
1712,SNOW,Blown in the wind. I _like_ that--I like _that_.
1713,SNOW,"Well, now I leave you, people."""
1714,SNOW,
1715,SNOW,"""Come, Meserve,"
1716,SNOW,We thought you were deciding not to go--
1717,SNOW,The ways you found to say the praise of comfort
1718,SNOW,"And being where you are. You want to stay."""
1719,SNOW,
1720,SNOW,"""I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow."
1721,SNOW,"This house is frozen brittle, all except"
1722,SNOW,This room you sit in. If you think the wind
1723,SNOW,"Sounds further off, it's not because it's dying;"
1724,SNOW,You're further under in the snow--that's all--
1725,SNOW,And feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust
1726,SNOW,"It bursts against us at the chimney mouth,"
1727,SNOW,And at the eaves. I like it from inside
1728,SNOW,More than I shall out in it. But the horses
1729,SNOW,"Are rested and it's time to say good-night,"
1730,SNOW,"And let you get to bed again. Good-night,"
1731,SNOW,"Sorry I had to break in on your sleep."""
1732,SNOW,
1733,SNOW,"""Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you"
1734,SNOW,You had us for a half-way station
1735,SNOW,To stop at. If you were the kind of man
1736,SNOW,"Paid heed to women, you'd take my advice"
1737,SNOW,And for your family's sake stay where you are.
1738,SNOW,But what good is my saying it over and over?
1739,SNOW,You've done more than you had a right to think
1740,SNOW,You could do--_now_. You know the risk you take
1741,SNOW,"In going on."""
1742,SNOW,
1743,SNOW,"""Our snow-storms as a rule"
1744,SNOW,"Aren't looked on as man-killers, and although"
1745,SNOW,I'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep
1746,SNOW,"Under it all, his door sealed up and lost,"
1747,SNOW,"Than the man fighting it to keep above it,"
1748,SNOW,Yet think of the small birds at roost and not
1749,SNOW,In nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?
1750,SNOW,Their bulk in water would be frozen rock
1751,SNOW,In no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow
1752,SNOW,They will come budding boughs from tree to tree
1753,SNOW,"Flirting their wings and saying Chickadee,"
1754,SNOW,"As if not knowing what you meant by the word storm."""
1755,SNOW,
1756,SNOW,"""But why when no one wants you to go on?"
1757,SNOW,"Your wife--she doesn't want you to. We don't,"
1758,SNOW,"And you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?"""
1759,SNOW,
1760,SNOW,"""Save us from being cornered by a woman."
1761,SNOW,"Well, there's""--She told Fred afterward that in"
1762,SNOW,"The pause right there, she thought the dreaded word"
1763,SNOW,"Was coming, ""God."" But no, he only said"
1764,SNOW,"""Well, there's--the storm. That says I must go on."
1765,SNOW,That wants me as a war might if it came.
1766,SNOW,"Ask any man."""
1767,SNOW,
1768,SNOW,He threw her that as something
1769,SNOW,To last her till he got outside the door.
1770,SNOW,He had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.
1771,SNOW,When Cole returned he found his wife still standing
1772,SNOW,"Beside the table near the open book,"
1773,SNOW,Not reading it.
1774,SNOW,
1775,SNOW,"""Well, what kind of a man"
1776,SNOW,"Do you call that?"" she said."

1782,SNOW,
1783,SNOW,"""Or disregarding people's civil questions--"
1784,SNOW,What? We've found out in one hour more about him
1785,SNOW,Than we had seeing him pass by in the road

1787,SNOW,You didn't think you'd keep him after all.
1788,SNOW,"Oh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave you"
1789,SNOW,"Much say in the matter, and I'm just as glad"
1790,SNOW,We're not in for a night of him. No sleep

1800,SNOW,"He won't come back, and if he telephones,"
1801,SNOW,"It won't be for an hour or two."""

1876,SNOW,"""Wait and call again."
1877,SNOW,You can't hear whether she has left the door
1878,SNOW,Wide open and the wind's blown out the lamp
1879,SNOW,"And the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?"""
1880,SNOW,
1881,SNOW,"""One of two things, either she's gone to bed"
1882,SNOW,"Or gone out doors."""
1883,SNOW,
1884,SNOW,"""In which case both are lost."
1885,SNOW,Do you know what she's like? Have you ever met her?
1886,SNOW,"It's strange she doesn't want to speak to us."""
1887,SNOW,
1888,SNOW,"""Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come."""
1889,SNOW,
1890,SNOW,"""A clock maybe."""
1891,SNOW,
1892,SNOW,"""Don't you hear something else?"""
1893,SNOW,
1894,SNOW,"""Not talking."""
1895,SNOW,
1896,SNOW,"""No."""
1897,SNOW,
1898,SNOW,"""Why, yes, I hear--what is it?"""
1899,SNOW,
1900,SNOW,"""What do you say it is?"""
1901,SNOW,
1902,SNOW,"""A baby's crying!"
1903,SNOW,"Frantic it sounds, though muffled and far off."""
1904,SNOW,
1905,SNOW,"""Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,"
1906,SNOW,"Not if she's there."""
1907,SNOW,
1908,SNOW,"""What do you make of it?"""
1909,SNOW,
1910,SNOW,"""There's only one thing possible to make,"
1911,SNOW,"That is, assuming--that she has gone out."
1912,SNOW,"Of course she hasn't though."" They both sat down"
1913,SNOW,"Helpless. ""There's nothing we can do till morning."""
1914,SNOW,
1915,SNOW,"""Fred, I shan't let you think of going out."""
1916,SNOW,
1917,SNOW,"""Hold on."" The double bell began to chirp."
1918,SNOW,They started up. Fred took the telephone.
1919,SNOW,"""Hello, Meserve. You're there, then!--And your wife?"
1920,SNOW,Good! Why I asked--she didn't seem to answer.
1921,SNOW,He says she went to let him in the barn.--
1922,SNOW,"We're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man."
1923,SNOW,"Drop in and see us when you're passing."""
1924,SNOW,
1925,SNOW,"""Well,"
1926,SNOW,"She has him then, though what she wants him for"
1927,SNOW,"I _don't_ see."""
1928,SNOW,
1929,SNOW,"""Possibly not for herself."
1930,SNOW,"Maybe she only wants him for the children."""
1931,SNOW,
1932,SNOW,"""The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing."
1933,SNOW,What spoiled our night was to him just his fun.
1934,SNOW,What did he come in for?--To talk and visit?
1935,SNOW,Thought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.
1936,SNOW,If he thinks he is going to make our house
1937,SNOW,"A halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere----"""
1938,SNOW,
1939,SNOW,"""I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned."""
1940,SNOW,
1941,SNOW,"""You think you haven't been concerned yourself."""
1942,SNOW,
1943,SNOW,"""If you mean he was inconsiderate"
1944,SNOW,To rout us out to think for him at midnight
1945,SNOW,"And then take our advice no more than nothing,"
1946,SNOW,"Why, I agree with you. But let's forgive him."
1947,SNOW,We've had a share in one night of his life.
1948,SNOW,"What'll you bet he ever calls again?"""
