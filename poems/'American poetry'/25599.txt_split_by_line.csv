171,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,Bright in prospective--welcomed but with tears.
172,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,
173,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"How false the view, a backward glance will tell!"
174,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"A tale of visions wrecked, of broken spell,"
175,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"Of valued hearts estranged or careless grown,"
176,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,Affection's links dissevered or unknown;
177,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"Of joys, deemed fadeless, gone to swift decay,"

191,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,Thus will compare Hope's sketch of bliss to be
192,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"With the undreamed of, sad reality;"
193,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"Yet this and more the afflicted heart may bear,"
194,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"If Faith, celestial visitant, be there,"
195,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"Whispering of greener shores, of purer skies,"
196,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"Of flowers unfading, love that never dies,"
197,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,"A glimpse of joy to come in mercy given,"
198,WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM.,The eternal sunshine of approving Heaven.
