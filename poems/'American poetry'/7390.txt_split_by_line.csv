37,THE MORNING VISIT,THE MORNING VISIT
38,THE MORNING VISIT,
39,THE MORNING VISIT,"A sick man's chamber, though it often boast"
40,THE MORNING VISIT,"The grateful presence of a literal toast,"
41,THE MORNING VISIT,"Can hardly claim, amidst its various wealth,"
42,THE MORNING VISIT,The right unchallenged to propose a health;
43,THE MORNING VISIT,"Yet though its tenant is denied the feast,"
44,THE MORNING VISIT,"Friendship must launch his sentiment at least,"
45,THE MORNING VISIT,"As prisoned damsels, locked from lovers' lips,"
46,THE MORNING VISIT,Toss them a kiss from off their fingers' tips.
47,THE MORNING VISIT,
48,THE MORNING VISIT,"The morning visit,--not till sickness falls"
49,THE MORNING VISIT,In the charmed circles of your own safe walls;
50,THE MORNING VISIT,Till fever's throb and pain's relentless rack
51,THE MORNING VISIT,Stretch you all helpless on your aching back;
52,THE MORNING VISIT,"Not till you play the patient in your turn,"
53,THE MORNING VISIT,The morning visit's mystery shall you learn.
54,THE MORNING VISIT,
55,THE MORNING VISIT,"'T is a small matter in your neighbor's case,"
56,THE MORNING VISIT,To charge your fee for showing him your face;
57,THE MORNING VISIT,"You skip up-stairs, inquire, inspect, and touch,"
58,THE MORNING VISIT,"Prescribe, take leave, and off to twenty such."
59,THE MORNING VISIT,
60,THE MORNING VISIT,"But when at length, by fate's transferred decree,"
61,THE MORNING VISIT,"The visitor becomes the visitee,"
62,THE MORNING VISIT,"Oh, then, indeed, it pulls another string;"
63,THE MORNING VISIT,"Your ox is gored, and that's a different thing!"
64,THE MORNING VISIT,"Your friend is sick: phlegmatic as a Turk,"
65,THE MORNING VISIT,You write your recipe and let it work;
66,THE MORNING VISIT,"Not yours to stand the shiver and the frown,"
67,THE MORNING VISIT,"And sometimes worse, with which your draught goes down."
68,THE MORNING VISIT,"Calm as a clock your knowing hand directs,"
69,THE MORNING VISIT,"_Rhei, jalapae ana grana sex_,"
70,THE MORNING VISIT,"Or traces on some tender missive's back,"
71,THE MORNING VISIT,_Scrupulos duos pulveris ipecac_;
72,THE MORNING VISIT,"And leaves your patient to his qualms and gripes,"
73,THE MORNING VISIT,Cool as a sportsman banging at his snipes.
74,THE MORNING VISIT,"But change the time, the person, and the place,"
75,THE MORNING VISIT,"And be yourself ""the interesting case,"""
76,THE MORNING VISIT,You'll gain some knowledge which it's well to learn;
77,THE MORNING VISIT,In future practice it may serve your turn.
78,THE MORNING VISIT,"Leeches, for instance,--pleasing creatures quite;"
79,THE MORNING VISIT,"Try them,--and bless you,--don't you find they bite?"
80,THE MORNING VISIT,"You raise a blister for the smallest cause,"
81,THE MORNING VISIT,"But be yourself the sitter whom it draws,"
82,THE MORNING VISIT,"And trust my statement, you will not deny"
83,THE MORNING VISIT,The worst of draughtsmen is your Spanish fly!
84,THE MORNING VISIT,"It's mighty easy ordering when you please,"
85,THE MORNING VISIT,_Infusi sennae capiat uncias tres_;
86,THE MORNING VISIT,It's mighty different when you quackle down
87,THE MORNING VISIT,Your own three ounces of the liquid brown.
88,THE MORNING VISIT,"_Pilula, pulvis_,--pleasant words enough,"
89,THE MORNING VISIT,When other throats receive the shocking stuff;
90,THE MORNING VISIT,"But oh, what flattery can disguise the groan"
91,THE MORNING VISIT,That meets the gulp which sends it through your own!
92,THE MORNING VISIT,"Be gentle, then, though Art's unsparing rules"
93,THE MORNING VISIT,Give you the handling of her sharpest tools;
94,THE MORNING VISIT,"Use them not rashly,--sickness is enough;"
95,THE MORNING VISIT,"Be always ""ready,"" but be never ""rough."""
96,THE MORNING VISIT,
97,THE MORNING VISIT,"Of all the ills that suffering man endures,"
98,THE MORNING VISIT,The largest fraction liberal Nature cures;
99,THE MORNING VISIT,"Of those remaining, 't is the smallest part"
100,THE MORNING VISIT,Yields to the efforts of judicious Art;
101,THE MORNING VISIT,"But simple _Kindness_, kneeling by the bed"
102,THE MORNING VISIT,"To shift the pillow for the sick man's head,"
103,THE MORNING VISIT,"Give the fresh draught to cool the lips that burn,"
104,THE MORNING VISIT,"Fan the hot brow, the weary frame to turn,--"
105,THE MORNING VISIT,"Kindness, untutored by our grave M. D.'s,"
106,THE MORNING VISIT,"But Nature's graduate, when she schools to please,"
107,THE MORNING VISIT,Wins back more sufferers with her voice and smile
108,THE MORNING VISIT,Than all the trumpery in the druggist's pile.
109,THE MORNING VISIT,
110,THE MORNING VISIT,"Once more, be quiet: coming up the stair,"
111,THE MORNING VISIT,"Don't be a plantigrade, a human bear,"
112,THE MORNING VISIT,"But, stealing softly on the silent toe,"
113,THE MORNING VISIT,Reach the sick chamber ere you're heard below.
114,THE MORNING VISIT,"Whatever changes there may greet your eyes,"
115,THE MORNING VISIT,Let not your looks proclaim the least surprise;
116,THE MORNING VISIT,It's not your business by your face to show
117,THE MORNING VISIT,All that your patient does not want to know;
118,THE MORNING VISIT,"Nay, use your optics with considerate care,"
119,THE MORNING VISIT,And don't abuse your privilege to stare.
120,THE MORNING VISIT,"But if your eyes may probe him overmuch,"
121,THE MORNING VISIT,Beware still further how you rudely touch;
122,THE MORNING VISIT,"Don't clutch his carpus in your icy fist,"
123,THE MORNING VISIT,But warm your fingers ere you take the wrist.
124,THE MORNING VISIT,"If the poor victim needs must be percussed,"
125,THE MORNING VISIT,Don't make an anvil of his aching bust;
126,THE MORNING VISIT,(Doctors exist within a hundred miles
127,THE MORNING VISIT,Who thump a thorax as they'd hammer piles;)
128,THE MORNING VISIT,"If you must listen to his doubtful chest,"
129,THE MORNING VISIT,"Catch the essentials, and ignore the rest."
130,THE MORNING VISIT,Spare him; the sufferer wants of you and art
131,THE MORNING VISIT,"A track to steer by, not a finished chart."
132,THE MORNING VISIT,So of your questions: don't in mercy try
133,THE MORNING VISIT,To pump your patient absolutely dry;
134,THE MORNING VISIT,"He's not a mollusk squirming in a dish,"
135,THE MORNING VISIT,You're not Agassiz; and he's not a fish.
136,THE MORNING VISIT,
137,THE MORNING VISIT,"And last, not least, in each perplexing case,"
138,THE MORNING VISIT,Learn the sweet magic of a cheerful face;
139,THE MORNING VISIT,"Not always smiling, but at least serene,"
140,THE MORNING VISIT,When grief and anguish cloud the anxious scene.
141,THE MORNING VISIT,"Each look, each movement, every word and tone,"
142,THE MORNING VISIT,Should tell your patient you are all his own;
143,THE MORNING VISIT,"Not the mere artist, purchased to attend,"
144,THE MORNING VISIT,"But the warm, ready, self-forgetting friend,"
145,THE MORNING VISIT,Whose genial visit in itself combines
146,THE MORNING VISIT,"The best of cordials, tonics, anodynes."
147,THE MORNING VISIT,
148,THE MORNING VISIT,Such is the _visit_ that from day to day
149,THE MORNING VISIT,Sheds o'er my chamber its benignant ray.
150,THE MORNING VISIT,"I give his health, who never cared to claim"
151,THE MORNING VISIT,Her babbling homage from the tongue of Fame;
152,THE MORNING VISIT,"Unmoved by praise, he stands by all confest,"
153,THE MORNING VISIT,"The truest, noblest, wisest, kindest, best."

161,THE TWO ARMIES,THE TWO ARMIES
162,THE TWO ARMIES,
163,THE TWO ARMIES,"As Life's unending column pours,"
164,THE TWO ARMIES,"Two marshalled hosts are seen,--"
165,THE TWO ARMIES,Two armies on the trampled shores
166,THE TWO ARMIES,That Death flows black between.
167,THE TWO ARMIES,
168,THE TWO ARMIES,"One marches to the drum-beat's roll,"
169,THE TWO ARMIES,"The wide-mouthed clarion's bray,"
170,THE TWO ARMIES,"And bears upon a crimson scroll,"
171,THE TWO ARMIES,"""Our glory is to slay."""
172,THE TWO ARMIES,
173,THE TWO ARMIES,"One moves in silence by the stream,"
174,THE TWO ARMIES,"With sad, yet watchful eyes,"
175,THE TWO ARMIES,Calm as the patient planet's gleam
176,THE TWO ARMIES,That walks the clouded skies.
177,THE TWO ARMIES,
178,THE TWO ARMIES,"Along its front no sabres shine,"
179,THE TWO ARMIES,No blood-red pennons wave;
180,THE TWO ARMIES,"Its banner bears the single line,"
181,THE TWO ARMIES,"""Our duty is to save."""
182,THE TWO ARMIES,
183,THE TWO ARMIES,For those no death-bed's lingering shade;
184,THE TWO ARMIES,"At Honor's trumpet-call,"
185,THE TWO ARMIES,With knitted brow and lifted blade
186,THE TWO ARMIES,In Glory's arms they fall.
187,THE TWO ARMIES,
188,THE TWO ARMIES,"For these no clashing falchions bright,"
189,THE TWO ARMIES,No stirring battle-cry;
190,THE TWO ARMIES,"The bloodless stabber calls by night,--"
191,THE TWO ARMIES,"Each answers, ""Here am I!"""
192,THE TWO ARMIES,
193,THE TWO ARMIES,"For those the sculptor's laurelled bust,"
194,THE TWO ARMIES,"The builder's marble piles,"
195,THE TWO ARMIES,The anthems pealing o'er their dust
196,THE TWO ARMIES,Through long cathedral aisles.
197,THE TWO ARMIES,
198,THE TWO ARMIES,For these the blossom-sprinkled turf
199,THE TWO ARMIES,That floods the lonely graves
200,THE TWO ARMIES,When Spring rolls in her sea-green surf
201,THE TWO ARMIES,In flowery-foaming waves.
202,THE TWO ARMIES,
203,THE TWO ARMIES,"Two paths lead upward from below,"
204,THE TWO ARMIES,"And angels wait above,"
205,THE TWO ARMIES,"Who count each burning life-drop's flow,"
206,THE TWO ARMIES,Each falling tear of Love.
207,THE TWO ARMIES,
208,THE TWO ARMIES,Though from the Hero's bleeding breast
209,THE TWO ARMIES,"Her pulses Freedom drew,"
210,THE TWO ARMIES,Though the white lilies in her crest
211,THE TWO ARMIES,"Sprang from that scarlet dew,--"
212,THE TWO ARMIES,
213,THE TWO ARMIES,While Valor's haughty champions wait
214,THE TWO ARMIES,"Till all their scars are shown,"
215,THE TWO ARMIES,"Love walks unchallenged through the gate,"
216,THE TWO ARMIES,To sit beside the Throne.

223,THE STETHOSCOPE SONG,
224,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD
225,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
226,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"THERE was a young man in Boston town,"
227,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"He bought him a stethoscope nice and new,"
228,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"All mounted and finished and polished down,"
229,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,With an ivory cap and a stopper too.
230,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
231,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"It happened a spider within did crawl,"
232,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And spun him a web of ample size,"
233,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Wherein there chanced one day to fall
234,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A couple of very imprudent flies.
235,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
236,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The first was a bottle-fly, big and blue,"
237,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The second was smaller, and thin and long;"
238,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"So there was a concert between the two,"
239,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Like an octave flute and a tavern gong.
240,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
241,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now being from Paris but recently,"
242,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,This fine young man would show his skill;
243,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And so they gave him, his hand to try,"
244,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A hospital patient extremely ill.
245,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
246,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Some said that his liver was short of bile,"
247,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And some that his heart was over size,"
248,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"While some kept arguing, all the while,"
249,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,He was crammed with tubercles up to his eyes.
250,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
251,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"This fine young man then up stepped he,"
252,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And all the doctors made a pause;
253,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Said he, The man must die, you see,"
254,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,By the fifty-seventh of Louis's laws.
255,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
256,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"But since the case is a desperate one,"
257,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To explore his chest it may be well;
258,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"For if he should die and it were not done,"
259,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,You know the autopsy would not tell.
260,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
261,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Then out his stethoscope he took,"
262,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And on it placed his curious ear;
263,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Mon Dieu! said he, with a knowing look,"
264,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Why, here is a sound that 's mighty queer."
265,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
266,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The bourdonnement is very clear,--"
267,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Amphoric buzzing, as I'm alive"
268,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Five doctors took their turn to hear;
269,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Amphoric buzzing, said all the five."
270,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
271,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,There's empyema beyond a doubt;
272,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,We'll plunge a trocar in his side.
273,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The diagnosis was made out,--"
274,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,They tapped the patient; so he died.
275,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
276,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Now such as hate new-fashioned toys
277,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Began to look extremely glum;
278,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"They said that rattles were made for boys,"
279,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And vowed that his buzzing was all a hum.
280,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
281,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"There was an old lady had long been sick,"
282,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And what was the matter none did know
283,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Her pulse was slow, though her tongue was quick;"
284,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To her this knowing youth must go.
285,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
286,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"So there the nice old lady sat,"
287,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,With phials and boxes all in a row;
288,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"She asked the young doctor what he was at,"
289,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To thump her and tumble her ruffles so.
290,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
291,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now, when the stethoscope came out,"
292,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The flies began to buzz and whiz
293,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Oh ho! the matter is clear, no doubt;"
294,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,An aneurism there plainly is.
295,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
296,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The bruit de rape and the bruit de scie
297,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And the bruit de diable are all combined;
298,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"How happy Bouillaud would be,"
299,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,If he a case like this could find!
300,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
301,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now, when the neighboring doctors found"
302,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"A case so rare had been descried,"
303,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,They every day her ribs did pound
304,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,In squads of twenty; so she died.
305,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
306,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Then six young damsels, slight and frail,"
307,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Received this kind young doctor's cares;
308,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"They all were getting slim and pale,"
309,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And short of breath on mounting stairs.
310,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
311,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"They all made rhymes with ""sighs"" and ""skies,"""
312,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And loathed their puddings and buttered rolls,"
313,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"And dieted, much to their friends' surprise,"
314,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,On pickles and pencils and chalk and coals.
315,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
316,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"So fast their little hearts did bound,"
317,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The frightened insects buzzed the more;
318,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,So over all their chests he found
319,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The rale sifflant and the rale sonore.
320,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
321,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"He shook his head. There's grave disease,--"
322,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,I greatly fear you all must die;
323,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"A slight post-mortem, if you please,"
324,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Surviving friends would gratify.
325,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
326,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The six young damsels wept aloud,"
327,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Which so prevailed on six young men
328,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"That each his honest love avowed,"
329,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,Whereat they all got well again.
330,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
331,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,This poor young man was all aghast;
332,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,The price of stethoscopes came down;
333,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,And so he was reduced at last
334,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,To practise in a country town.
335,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
336,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"The doctors being very sore,"
337,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,A stethoscope they did devise
338,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"That had a rammer to clear the bore,"
339,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,With a knob at the end to kill the flies.
340,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,
341,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Now use your ears, all you that can,"
342,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"But don't forget to mind your eyes,"
343,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"Or you may be cheated, like this young man,"
344,A PROFESSIONAL BALLAD,"By a couple of silly, abnormal flies."

439,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","They make a feast on Thursday next,"
440,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",And hope to make the feasters merry;
441,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",They own they're something more perplexed
442,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",For poets than for port and sherry.
443,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",They want the men of--(word torn out);
444,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Our friends will come with anxious faces,"
445,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","(To see our blankets off, no doubt,"
446,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",And trot us out and show our paces.)
447,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",
448,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",They hint that papers by the score

450,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","They don't exactly mean a bore,"
451,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",But only trying to the patience;
452,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",That such as--you know who I mean--
453,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Distinguished for their--what d' ye call 'em--
454,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Should bring the dews of Hippocrene

456,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",
457,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",--The same old story: that's the chaff
458,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",To catch the birds that sing the ditties;
459,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Upon my soul, it makes me laugh"
460,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",To read these letters from Committees!
461,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","They're all so loving and so fair,--"
462,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",All for your sake such kind compunction;
463,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",'T would save your carriage half its wear

467,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","And beg such learned folk to listen,"
468,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","To ask a smile, or coax a tear"
469,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Beneath these stoic lids to glisten?

471,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Ask the whole frame to feel it gushing,"
472,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",While throbbing fierce from heel to head
473,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",The vast aortic tide was rushing.

477,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",While through the myriad-channelled brain

480,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","The springing haunches gathered shorter,"
481,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","While the scourged racer, leap on leap,"
482,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Was stretching through the last hot quarter!
483,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",
484,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Ah me! you take the bud that came
485,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Self-sown in your poor garden's borders,"

489,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","(A pale afair, not worth the keeping,)--"
490,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Good morning; and your bud is sent
491,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",To join the tea-leaves used for sweeping.
492,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",
493,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Not always so, kind hearts and true,--"
494,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",For such I know are round me beating;

496,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Fresh gathered for the hour of meeting,"
497,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853","Pale though its outer leaves may be,"

499,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",Where the warm life we cannot see--

506,"AT NEW YORK, MAY 5, 1853",O'er Chesapeake the lighthouse gleaming;

573,CANTO FIRST,CANTO FIRST
574,CANTO FIRST,
575,CANTO FIRST,"OLD Rip Van Winkle had a grandson, Rip,"
576,CANTO FIRST,"Of the paternal block a genuine chip,--"
577,CANTO FIRST,"A lazy, sleepy, curious kind of chap;"
578,CANTO FIRST,"He, like his grandsire, took a mighty nap,"
579,CANTO FIRST,Whereof the story I propose to tell
580,CANTO FIRST,"In two brief cantos, if you listen well."
581,CANTO FIRST,
582,CANTO FIRST,The times were hard when Rip to manhood grew;
583,CANTO FIRST,They always will be when there's work to do.
584,CANTO FIRST,"He tried at farming,--found it rather slow,--"
585,CANTO FIRST,And then at teaching--what he did n't know;
586,CANTO FIRST,"Then took to hanging round the tavern bars,"
587,CANTO FIRST,"To frequent toddies and long-nine cigars,"
588,CANTO FIRST,"Till Dame Van Winkle, out of patience, vexed"
589,CANTO FIRST,"With preaching homilies, having for their text"
590,CANTO FIRST,"A mop, a broomstick, aught that might avail"
591,CANTO FIRST,"To point a moral or adorn a tale,"
592,CANTO FIRST,"Exclaimed, ""I have it! Now, then, Mr. V."
593,CANTO FIRST,"He's good for something,--make him an M. D.!"""
594,CANTO FIRST,
595,CANTO FIRST,The die was cast; the youngster was content;
596,CANTO FIRST,"They packed his shirts and stockings, and he went."
597,CANTO FIRST,How hard he studied it were vain to tell;
598,CANTO FIRST,"He drowsed through Wistar, nodded over Bell,"
599,CANTO FIRST,"Slept sound with Cooper, snored aloud on Good;"
600,CANTO FIRST,"Heard heaps of lectures,--doubtless understood,--"
601,CANTO FIRST,"A constant listener, for he did not fail"
602,CANTO FIRST,To carve his name on every bench and rail.
603,CANTO FIRST,
604,CANTO FIRST,"Months grew to years; at last he counted three,"
605,CANTO FIRST,And Rip Van Winkle found himself M. D.
606,CANTO FIRST,Illustrious title! in a gilded frame
607,CANTO FIRST,"He set the sheepskin with his Latin name,"
608,CANTO FIRST,"RIPUM VAN WINKLUM, QUEM we--SCIMUS--know"
609,CANTO FIRST,IDONEUM ESSE--to do so and so.
610,CANTO FIRST,He hired an office; soon its walls displayed
611,CANTO FIRST,"His new diploma and his stock in trade,"
612,CANTO FIRST,"A mighty arsenal to subdue disease,"
613,CANTO FIRST,"Of various names, whereof I mention these"
614,CANTO FIRST,"Lancets and bougies, great and little squirt,"
615,CANTO FIRST,"Rhubarb and Senna, Snakeroot, Thoroughwort,"
616,CANTO FIRST,"Ant. Tart., Vin. Colch., Pil. Cochiae, and Black Drop,"
617,CANTO FIRST,"Tinctures of Opium, Gentian, Henbane, Hop,"

623,CANTO FIRST,"And roots of Sassafras, and ""Sassaf'rill,"""
624,CANTO FIRST,"Brandy,--for colics,--Pinkroot, death on worms,--"
625,CANTO FIRST,"Valerian, calmer of hysteric squirms,"
626,CANTO FIRST,"Musk, Assafoetida, the resinous gum"
627,CANTO FIRST,"Named from its odor,--well, it does smell some,--"
628,CANTO FIRST,"Jalap, that works not wisely, but too well,"
629,CANTO FIRST,Ten pounds of Bark and six of Calomel.
630,CANTO FIRST,
631,CANTO FIRST,"For outward griefs he had an ample store,"
632,CANTO FIRST,"Some twenty jars and gallipots, or more:"
633,CANTO FIRST,_Ceratum simplex_--housewives oft compile
634,CANTO FIRST,"The same at home, and call it ""wax and ile;"""
635,CANTO FIRST,"_Unguentum resinosum_--change its name,"
636,CANTO FIRST,"The ""drawing salve"" of many an ancient dame;"
637,CANTO FIRST,"_Argenti Nitras_, also Spanish flies,"
638,CANTO FIRST,Whose virtue makes the water-bladders rise--
639,CANTO FIRST,(Some say that spread upon a toper's skin
640,CANTO FIRST,"They draw no water, only rum or gin);"
641,CANTO FIRST,"Leeches, sweet vermin! don't they charm the sick?"
642,CANTO FIRST,And Sticking-plaster--how it hates to stick
643,CANTO FIRST,"_Emplastrum Ferri_--ditto _Picis_, Pitch;"
644,CANTO FIRST,"Washes and Powders, Brimstone for the--which,"
645,CANTO FIRST,"_Scabies_ or _Psora_, is thy chosen name"
646,CANTO FIRST,"Since Hahnemann's goose-quill scratched thee into fame,"
647,CANTO FIRST,"Proved thee the source of every nameless ill,"
648,CANTO FIRST,"Whose sole specific is a moonshine pill,"
649,CANTO FIRST,"Till saucy Science, with a quiet grin,"
650,CANTO FIRST,"Held up the Acarus, crawling on a pin?"
651,CANTO FIRST,--Mountains have labored and have brought forth mice
652,CANTO FIRST,The Dutchman's theory hatched a brood of--twice
653,CANTO FIRST,I've well-nigh said them--words unfitting quite
654,CANTO FIRST,For these fair precincts and for ears polite.
655,CANTO FIRST,
656,CANTO FIRST,"The surest foot may chance at last to slip,"
657,CANTO FIRST,And so at length it proved with Doctor Rip.
658,CANTO FIRST,"One full-sized bottle stood upon the shelf,"
659,CANTO FIRST,Which held the medicine that he took himself;
660,CANTO FIRST,"Whate'er the reason, it must be confessed"
661,CANTO FIRST,He filled that bottle oftener than the rest;
662,CANTO FIRST,What drug it held I don't presume to know--
663,CANTO FIRST,"The gilded label said ""Elixir Pro."""
664,CANTO FIRST,
665,CANTO FIRST,"One day the Doctor found the bottle full,"
666,CANTO FIRST,"And, being thirsty, took a vigorous pull,"
667,CANTO FIRST,"Put back the ""Elixir"" where 't was always found,"
668,CANTO FIRST,And had old Dobbin saddled and brought round.
669,CANTO FIRST,--You know those old-time rhubarb-colored nags
670,CANTO FIRST,That carried Doctors and their saddle-bags;
671,CANTO FIRST,Sagacious beasts! they stopped at every place
672,CANTO FIRST,Where blinds were shut--knew every patient's case--
673,CANTO FIRST,Looked up and thought--The baby's in a fit--
674,CANTO FIRST,That won't last long--he'll soon be through with it;
675,CANTO FIRST,But shook their heads before the knockered door
676,CANTO FIRST,Where some old lady told the story o'er
677,CANTO FIRST,Whose endless stream of tribulation flows
678,CANTO FIRST,For gastric griefs and peristaltic woes.
679,CANTO FIRST,
680,CANTO FIRST,"What jack-o'-lantern led him from his way,"
681,CANTO FIRST,"And where it led him, it were hard to say;"
682,CANTO FIRST,Enough that wandering many a weary mile
683,CANTO FIRST,"Through paths the mountain sheep trod single file,"
684,CANTO FIRST,O'ercome by feelings such as patients know
685,CANTO FIRST,"Who dose too freely with ""Elixir Pro.,"""
686,CANTO FIRST,"He tumbl--dismounted, slightly in a heap,"
687,CANTO FIRST,"And lay, promiscuous, lapped in balmy sleep."
688,CANTO FIRST,
689,CANTO FIRST,"Night followed night, and day succeeded day,"
690,CANTO FIRST,But snoring still the slumbering Doctor lay.
691,CANTO FIRST,"Poor Dobbin, starving, thought upon his stall,"
692,CANTO FIRST,"And straggled homeward, saddle-bags and all."
693,CANTO FIRST,"The village people hunted all around,"
694,CANTO FIRST,"But Rip was missing,--never could be found."
695,CANTO FIRST,"""Drownded,"" they guessed;--for more than half a year"
696,CANTO FIRST,The pouts and eels did taste uncommon queer;
697,CANTO FIRST,Some said of apple-brandy--other some
698,CANTO FIRST,Found a strong flavor of New England rum.
699,CANTO FIRST,
700,CANTO FIRST,Why can't a fellow hear the fine things said
701,CANTO FIRST,About a fellow when a fellow's dead?
702,CANTO FIRST,The best of doctors--so the press declared--
703,CANTO FIRST,"A public blessing while his life was spared,"
704,CANTO FIRST,"True to his country, bounteous to the poor,"
705,CANTO FIRST,"In all things temperate, sober, just, and pure;"
706,CANTO FIRST,"The best of husbands! echoed Mrs. Van,"
707,CANTO FIRST,And set her cap to catch another man.
708,CANTO FIRST,
709,CANTO FIRST,"So ends this Canto--if it's quantum suff.,"
710,CANTO FIRST,"We'll just stop here and say we've had enough,"
711,CANTO FIRST,And leave poor Rip to sleep for thirty years;
712,CANTO FIRST,I grind the organ--if you lend your ears
713,CANTO FIRST,"To hear my second Canto, after that"
714,CANTO FIRST,We 'll send around the monkey with the hat.
715,CANTO FIRST,
716,CANTO FIRST,
717,CANTO SECOND,CANTO SECOND
718,CANTO SECOND,
719,CANTO SECOND,So thirty years had passed--but not a word
720,CANTO SECOND,In all that time of Rip was ever heard;
721,CANTO SECOND,The world wagged on--it never does go back--
722,CANTO SECOND,The widow Van was now the widow Mac----
723,CANTO SECOND,"France was an Empire--Andrew J. was dead,"
724,CANTO SECOND,And Abraham L. was reigning in his stead.
725,CANTO SECOND,"Four murderous years had passed in savage strife,"
726,CANTO SECOND,Yet still the rebel held his bloody knife.
727,CANTO SECOND,
728,CANTO SECOND,--At last one morning--who forgets the day
729,CANTO SECOND,When the black cloud of war dissolved away
730,CANTO SECOND,"The joyous tidings spread o'er land and sea,"
731,CANTO SECOND,Rebellion done for! Grant has captured Lee!
732,CANTO SECOND,Up every flagstaff sprang the Stars and Stripes--
733,CANTO SECOND,Out rushed the Extras wild with mammoth types--
734,CANTO SECOND,"Down went the laborer's hod, the school-boy's book--"
735,CANTO SECOND,"""Hooraw!"" he cried, ""the rebel army's took!"""
736,CANTO SECOND,Ah! what a time! the folks all mad with joy
737,CANTO SECOND,"Each fond, pale mother thinking of her boy;"
738,CANTO SECOND,"Old gray-haired fathers meeting--""Have--you--heard?"""
739,CANTO SECOND,And then a choke--and not another word;
740,CANTO SECOND,"Sisters all smiling--maidens, not less dear,"
741,CANTO SECOND,In trembling poise between a smile and tear;
742,CANTO SECOND,Poor Bridget thinking how she 'll stuff the plums
743,CANTO SECOND,In that big cake for Johnny when he comes;
744,CANTO SECOND,Cripples afoot; rheumatics on the jump;
745,CANTO SECOND,Old girls so loving they could hug the pump;
746,CANTO SECOND,Guns going bang! from every fort and ship;
747,CANTO SECOND,They banged so loud at last they wakened Rip.
748,CANTO SECOND,
749,CANTO SECOND,"I spare the picture, how a man appears"
750,CANTO SECOND,Who's been asleep a score or two of years;
751,CANTO SECOND,You all have seen it to perfection done
752,CANTO SECOND,By Joe Van Wink--I mean Rip Jefferson.
753,CANTO SECOND,"Well, so it was; old Rip at last came back,"
754,CANTO SECOND,Claimed his old wife--the present widow Mac----
755,CANTO SECOND,"Had his old sign regilded, and began"
756,CANTO SECOND,To practise physic on the same old plan.
757,CANTO SECOND,Some weeks went by--it was not long to wait--
758,CANTO SECOND,"And ""please to call"" grew frequent on the slate."
759,CANTO SECOND,"He had, in fact, an ancient, mildewed air,"
760,CANTO SECOND,"A long gray beard, a plenteous lack of hair,--"
761,CANTO SECOND,The musty look that always recommends
762,CANTO SECOND,Your good old Doctor to his ailing friends.
763,CANTO SECOND,--Talk of your science! after all is said
764,CANTO SECOND,There's nothing like a bare and shiny head;
765,CANTO SECOND,Age lends the graces that are sure to please;
766,CANTO SECOND,"Folks want their Doctors mouldy, like their cheese."
767,CANTO SECOND,
768,CANTO SECOND,So Rip began to look at people's tongues
769,CANTO SECOND,"And thump their briskets (called it ""sound their lungs""),"
770,CANTO SECOND,"Brushed up his knowledge smartly as he could,"
771,CANTO SECOND,Read in old Cullen and in Doctor Good.
772,CANTO SECOND,The town was healthy; for a month or two
773,CANTO SECOND,He gave the sexton little work to do.
774,CANTO SECOND,
775,CANTO SECOND,"About the time when dog-day heats begin,"
776,CANTO SECOND,The summer's usual maladies set in;
777,CANTO SECOND,"With autumn evenings dysentery came,"
778,CANTO SECOND,And dusky typhoid lit his smouldering flame;
779,CANTO SECOND,"The blacksmith ailed, the carpenter was down,"
780,CANTO SECOND,And half the children sickened in the town.
781,CANTO SECOND,The sexton's face grew shorter than before--
782,CANTO SECOND,The sexton's wife a brand-new bonnet wore--
783,CANTO SECOND,Things looked quite serious--Death had got a grip
784,CANTO SECOND,"On old and young, in spite of Doctor Rip."
785,CANTO SECOND,
786,CANTO SECOND,And now the Squire was taken with a chill--
787,CANTO SECOND,"Wife gave ""hot-drops""--at night an Indian pill;"
788,CANTO SECOND,"Next morning, feverish--bedtime, getting worse--"
789,CANTO SECOND,Out of his head--began to rave and curse;
790,CANTO SECOND,The Doctor sent for--double quick he came
791,CANTO SECOND,"_Ant. Tart. gran. duo_, and repeat the same"
792,CANTO SECOND,If no et cetera. Third day--nothing new;
793,CANTO SECOND,Percussed his thorax till 't was black and blue--
794,CANTO SECOND,Lung-fever threatening--something of the sort--
795,CANTO SECOND,Out with the lancet--let him bleed--a quart--
796,CANTO SECOND,Ten leeches next--then blisters to his side;
797,CANTO SECOND,Ten grains of calomel; just then he died.
798,CANTO SECOND,
799,CANTO SECOND,The Deacon next required the Doctor's care--
800,CANTO SECOND,Took cold by sitting in a draught of air--
801,CANTO SECOND,"Pains in the back, but what the matter is"
802,CANTO SECOND,"Not quite so clear,--wife calls it ""rheumatiz."""
803,CANTO SECOND,Rubs back with flannel--gives him something hot--
804,CANTO SECOND,"""Ah!"" says the Deacon, ""that goes nigh the spot."""
805,CANTO SECOND,"Next day a rigor--""Run, my little man,"
806,CANTO SECOND,"And say the Deacon sends for Doctor Van."""
807,CANTO SECOND,"The Doctor came--percussion as before,"
808,CANTO SECOND,Thumping and banging till his ribs were sore--
809,CANTO SECOND,"""Right side the flattest""--then more vigorous raps--"
810,CANTO SECOND,"""Fever--that's certain--pleurisy, perhaps."
811,CANTO SECOND,"A quart of blood will ease the pain, no doubt,"
812,CANTO SECOND,"Ten leeches next will help to suck it out,"
813,CANTO SECOND,Then clap a blister on the painful part--
814,CANTO SECOND,But first two grains of _Antimonium Tart_.
815,CANTO SECOND,Last with a dose of cleansing calomel
816,CANTO SECOND,"Unload the portal system--(that sounds well!)"""
817,CANTO SECOND,
818,CANTO SECOND,"But when the selfsame remedies were tried,"
819,CANTO SECOND,"As all the village knew, the Squire had died;"
820,CANTO SECOND,
821,CANTO SECOND,"The neighbors hinted. ""This will never do;"
822,CANTO SECOND,"He's killed the Squire--he'll kill the Deacon too."""
823,CANTO SECOND,
824,CANTO SECOND,"Now when a doctor's patients are perplexed,"
825,CANTO SECOND,A consultation comes in order next--
826,CANTO SECOND,You know what that is? In a certain place
827,CANTO SECOND,Meet certain doctors to discuss a case
828,CANTO SECOND,"And other matters, such as weather, crops,"
829,CANTO SECOND,"Potatoes, pumpkins, lager-beer, and hops."
830,CANTO SECOND,"For what's the use?--there 's little to be said,"
831,CANTO SECOND,Nine times in ten your man's as good as dead;
832,CANTO SECOND,At best a talk (the secret to disclose)
833,CANTO SECOND,Where three men guess and sometimes one man knows.
834,CANTO SECOND,
835,CANTO SECOND,The counsel summoned came without delay--
836,CANTO SECOND,Young Doctor Green and shrewd old Doctor Gray--
837,CANTO SECOND,"They heard the story--""Bleed!"" says Doctor Green,"
838,CANTO SECOND,"""That's downright murder! cut his throat, you mean"
839,CANTO SECOND,"Leeches! the reptiles! Why, for pity's sake,"
840,CANTO SECOND,Not try an adder or a rattlesnake?
841,CANTO SECOND,"Blisters! Why bless you, they 're against the law--"
842,CANTO SECOND,It's rank assault and battery if they draw
843,CANTO SECOND,"Tartrate of Antimony! shade of Luke,"
844,CANTO SECOND,Stomachs turn pale at thought of such rebuke!
845,CANTO SECOND,The portal system! What's the man about?
846,CANTO SECOND,Unload your nonsense! Calomel's played out!
847,CANTO SECOND,You've been asleep--you'd better sleep away
848,CANTO SECOND,"Till some one calls you."""
849,CANTO SECOND,
850,CANTO SECOND,"""Stop!"" says Doctor Gray--"
851,CANTO SECOND,"""The story is you slept for thirty years;"
852,CANTO SECOND,"With brother Green, I own that it appears"
853,CANTO SECOND,You must have slumbered most amazing sound;
854,CANTO SECOND,"But sleep once more till thirty years come round,"
855,CANTO SECOND,"You'll find the lancet in its honored place,"
856,CANTO SECOND,"Leeches and blisters rescued from disgrace,"
857,CANTO SECOND,"Your drugs redeemed from fashion's passing scorn,"
858,CANTO SECOND,"And counted safe to give to babes unborn."""
859,CANTO SECOND,
860,CANTO SECOND,"Poor sleepy Rip, M. M. S. S., M. D.,"
861,CANTO SECOND,"A puzzled, serious, saddened man was he;"
862,CANTO SECOND,Home from the Deacon's house he plodded slow
863,CANTO SECOND,"And filled one bumper of ""Elixir Pro."""
864,CANTO SECOND,"""Good-by,"" he faltered, ""Mrs. Van, my dear!"
865,CANTO SECOND,"I'm going to sleep, but wake me once a year;"
866,CANTO SECOND,"I don't like bleaching in the frost and dew,"
867,CANTO SECOND,"I'll take the barn, if all the same to you."
868,CANTO SECOND,Just once a year--remember! no mistake!
869,CANTO SECOND,"Cry, 'Rip Van Winkle! time for you to wake!'"
870,CANTO SECOND,"Watch for the week in May when laylocks blow,"
871,CANTO SECOND,"For then the Doctors meet, and I must go."""
872,CANTO SECOND,
873,CANTO SECOND,Just once a year the Doctor's worthy dame
874,CANTO SECOND,Goes to the barn and shouts her husband's name;
875,CANTO SECOND,"""Come, Rip Van Winkle!"" (giving him a shake)"
876,CANTO SECOND,"""Rip! Rip Van Winkle! time for you to wake!"
877,CANTO SECOND,Laylocks in blossom! 't is the month of May--
878,CANTO SECOND,"The Doctors' meeting is this blessed day,"
879,CANTO SECOND,"And come what will, you know I heard you swear"
880,CANTO SECOND,"You'd never miss it, but be always there!"""
881,CANTO SECOND,
882,CANTO SECOND,"And so it is, as every year comes round"
883,CANTO SECOND,Old Rip Van Winkle here is always found.
884,CANTO SECOND,"You'll quickly know him by his mildewed air,"
885,CANTO SECOND,"The hayseed sprinkled through his scanty hair,"
886,CANTO SECOND,The lichens growing on his rusty suit--
887,CANTO SECOND,I've seen a toadstool sprouting on his boot--
888,CANTO SECOND,Who says I lie? Does any man presume?--
889,CANTO SECOND,Toadstool? No matter--call it a mushroom.
890,CANTO SECOND,Where is his seat? He moves it every year;
891,CANTO SECOND,"But look, you'll find him,--he is always here,--"
892,CANTO SECOND,Perhaps you'll track him by a whiff you know--
893,CANTO SECOND,"A certain flavor of ""Elixir Pro."""
894,CANTO SECOND,
895,CANTO SECOND,"Now, then, I give you--as you seem to think"
896,CANTO SECOND,We can give toasts without a drop to drink--
897,CANTO SECOND,"Health to the mighty sleeper,--long live he!"
898,CANTO SECOND,"Our brother Rip, M. M. S. S., M. D.!"
899,CANTO SECOND,
900,CANTO SECOND,
901,CANTO SECOND,
902,CANTO SECOND,
903,CANTO SECOND,
