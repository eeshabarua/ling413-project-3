219,,Memoir of George P. Morris.

222,,By Horace Binney Wallace.

224,,
225,,Bless thou thy lot; thy simple strains have led
226,,"The high-born muse to be the poor man's guest,"
227,,"And wafted on the wings of song, have sped"
228,,"Their way to many a rude, unlettered breast."

233,,Morris has hung the most beautiful thoughts in the world upon hinges
234,,of [illegible]; and his songs are destined to roll over bright lips
235,,"enough to form a [sonnet? illegible].  His sentiments are simple,"
236,,"honest, truthful, and familiar; his language is pure and eminently"
237,,"musical, and he is prodigally full of the poetry of every-day"
238,,living.

245,,The distinction with which the name of General Morris is now
246,,associated in a permanent connection with what is least factitious
247,,"or fugitive in American Art, is admitted and known; but the class"
248,,"of young men of letters in this country, at present, can hardly"
249,,"appreciate the extent to which they, and the profession to which"
250,,"they belong, are indebted to his animated exertions, his varied"
251,,"talents, his admirable resources of temper, during a period of twenty"
252,,"years, and at a time when the character of American literature, both"
253,,at home and abroad was yet to be formed.  The first great service
254,,"which the literary taste of this country received, was rendered by"
255,,Dennie; a remarkable man; qualified by nature and attainments to
256,,be a leader in new circumstances; fit to take part in the formation
257,,"of a national literature; as a vindicator of independence in thought,"
258,,able to establish freedom without disturbing the obligations of
259,,"law; as a conservative in taste, skilful to keep the tone of the"
260,,"great models with which his studies were familiar, without copying"
261,,"their style; by both capacities successful in developing the one,"
262,,"unchangeable spirit of Art, under a new form and with new effects."
263,,"In this office of field-marshal of our native forces, General"
264,,"Morris succeeded him under increased advantages, in some respect"
265,,"with higher powers, in a different, and certainly a vastly more"
266,,extended sphere of influence.  The manifold and lasting benefits
267,,"which, as editor of ""The Mirror,"" General Morris conferred on art and"
268,,"artists of every kind, by his tact, his liberality, the superiority"
269,,"of his judgement, and the vigor of his abilities; by the perseverance"
270,,"and address with which he disciplined a corps of youthful writers,"
271,,in the presence of a constant and heavy fire from the batteries of
272,,"foreign criticism; by the rare combination, so valuable in dealing"
273,,with the numerous aspirants in authorship with whom his position
274,,"brought him in contact; of a quick, true eye to discern in the"
275,,modesty of some nameless manuscript the future promises of a power
276,,hardly yet conscious of itself; a discretion to guide by sound
277,,"advice, and a generosity to aid with the most important kind of"
278,,assistance; the firm and open temper which his example tended to
279,,inspire into the relations of literary men with one another throughout
280,,"the land; and more than all, perhaps, by the harmony and union, of"
281,,"such inappreciable value, especially in the beginning of national"
282,,"effort, between the several sister arts of writing, music,"
283,,"painting, and dramatic exhibition, which the singular variety and"
284,,discursiveness of his intellectual sympathies led him constantly
285,,"to maintain and vindicate; these, in the multiplicity of their"
286,,"operation, and the full power of their joint effect, can be perfectly"
287,,understood only by those who possessed a contemporaneous knowledge
288,,"of the circumstances, and who, remembering the state of things"
289,,"at the commencement of the period alluded to, and observing what"
290,,"existed at the end of it, are able to look back over the whole interval, and see to what influences"
291,,and what persons the
292,,"extraordinary change which has taken place, is to be referred.  If,"
293,,"at this moment, the literary genius of America, renewed in youth,"
294,,"and quivering lie the eagle's wings with excess of vigor, seems"
295,,"about to make a new flight, from a higher vantage-ground, into"
296,,"loftier depths of airy distance, the capacity to take that flight"
297,,"must, to a great degree, be ascribed to those two persons whom we"
298,,have named; without whose services the brighter era which appears
299,,"now to be dawning, might yet be distant and doubtful."
300,,
301,,"Besides these particulars of past effort, which ought to make his"
302,,"countrymen love the reputation of the subject of this notice, we"
303,,regret that our limits forbid us to speak at large of those more
304,,"intimate qualities of personal value, which, in our judgment, form"
305,,"the genuine lustre of one who, admirable for other attainments, is"
306,,to be imitated in these.
307,,
308,,To us it is an instinctive feeling that a wrong is done to the
309,,proper grandeur of our complex nature--that a violence is offered
310,,to the higher consciousness of our immortal being--whenever an
311,,intellectual quality is extolled tot he neglect of a moral one.
312,,Moral excellence is the most real genius; and a temper to cope and
313,,calmly baffle the multitudinous assaults of the spiritual enmity
314,,"of active life, is a talent which outshines all praise of mental"
315,,"endowments.  Unhappily, the biographer of literary creators affords"
316,,few occasions in which a feeling of this kind can be indulged and
317,,gratified:  that sensibility of mental apprehensions which is the
318,,"fame of the author, is usually attended by a susceptibility of"
319,,passionate impression which is the fate of the man; and earth and
320,,sense delight to wreak their destructive vengences upon the spiritual
321,,"nature of him, of whose intellectual being they are the slaves and"
322,,"the sport.  In the present instance, we are concerned with the"
323,,"character--'totus, teres, atque rotundus;' which may be looked upon,"
324,,"from every side, with an equal satisfaction.  Search the wide world"
325,,"over, and you shall not find among the literary men of any nation,"
326,,one on whom the dignity of a free and manly spirit sits with a
327,,grace more native and familiar--whose spontaneous sentiments have
328,,a truer tone of nobleness--the course of whose usual feelings is
329,,"more expanded and honorable--whose acts, whether common and daily,"
330,,"or deliberate and much-considered, are wont at all times to be more"
331,,"beautifully impressed with those marks of sincerity, of modesty, and"
332,,"of justice, which form the very seal of worth in conduct.  Those"
333,,"jealousies, and littlenesses, and envyings, which prey upon"
334,,"the spirits of many men, as the vulture on the heart that chained"
335,,"Prometheus--and whose fierce besetment they who WILL be magnanimous,"
336,,"have to fight off, as one drives away the eagles from their prey,"
337,,with voice and gestures--seem never to assail him.  It is the
338,,happiness of his nature to have THAT only absolute deliverance from
339,,evil which is implied in being rendered insensible to temptation.
340,,"While the duty which is laid upon us, in this paper, mainly is to"
341,,open and set forth his poetic praises and claim the laurel for his
342,,literary merits; when the crown of song is to be conferred upon
343,,"him, we shall interpose to beg that the chaplet may be accompanied"
344,,"by some mark, or some inscription which shall declare,"
345,,
346,,"""This is the reward of moral excellence."""
347,,
348,,"For the success of our special purpose, in this notice, which is"
349,,to consider and make apparent the specific character which belongs
350,,"to General Morris as a literary artist and a poetic creator,"
351,,to explain his claims to that title which the common voice of the
352,,country has given to him--of The Song-Writer of America--it would
353,,have probably been more judicious had we kept out of view the
354,,matters of which we have just spoken.  It is recorded of a Grecian
355,,"painter, that having completed the picture of a sleeping nymph, he"
356,,added on the foreground the figure of a satyr gazing in amazement
357,,upon her beauty; but finding that the secondary form attracted
358,,"universal praise, he erased it as diverting applause from that"
359,,which he desired to have regarded as the principal monument of his
360,,skill.  There is in this anecdote a double wisdom; the world is as
361,,little willing to yield to a twofold superiority as it is able to
362,,appreciate two distinct objects at once.
363,,
364,,"In a review of literary reputations, perhaps nothing is fitted to"
365,,raise more surprise than the obvious inequality in the extend and
366,,greatness of the labors to which an equal reward of fame has been
367,,allotted.  The abounding energy and picturesque variety of Homer
368,,are illustrated in eight-and-forty books:  the remains of Sappho
369,,might be written on the surface of a leaf of the laurus nobilis.
370,,"Yet if the one expands before us with the magnificent extent, the"
371,,"diversified surface, the endless decorations of the earth itself,"
372,,"the other hangs on high, like a lone, clear star--small but"
373,,"intense--flashing upon us through the night of ages, invested with"
374,,circumstances of divinity not less unquestionable than those which
375,,attend the venerable majesty of the Ancient of Song.  The rich and
376,,"roseate light that shines around the name of Mimnermus, is shed"
377,,from some dozen or twenty lines:  the immortality of Tyrtaeus rests
378,,"upon a stanza or two, which have floated to us with their precious"
379,,"freight, over the sea of centuries, and will float on unsubmergible"
380,,by all the waves of Time.  The soul of Simonides lives to us in
381,,"a single couplet; but that is the very stuff of Eternity, which"
382,,"neither fire will assoil, nor tempest peril, nor the wrath of years"
383,,impair.  The Infinite has no degrees; wherever the world sees in
384,,"any human being the fire of the Everlasting, it bows with equal"
385,,"awe, whether that fire is displayed by only an occasional flash,"
386,,or by a prolonged and diffusive blaze.  There is a certain tone
387,,"which, hear it when we may, and where we may, we know to be the"
388,,accents of the gods; and whether its quality be shown in a single
389,,"utterance, or its volume displayed in a thousand bursts of music,"
390,,we surround the band of spirits whom we there detect in their mortal
391,,"disguise, with equal ceremonies of respect and worship, hailing"
392,,them alike as seraphs of a brighter sphere--sons of the morning.
393,,"This is natural, and it is reasonable.  Genius is not a degree of"
394,,"other qualities, nor is it a particular way or extent of displaying"
395,,"such qualities; it is a faculty by itself; it is a manner, of which"
396,,"we may judge with the same certainty from one exhibition, as from"
397,,"many.  The praise of a poet, therefore, is to be determined not"
398,,"by the nature of the work which he undertakes, but by the kind of"
399,,mastery which he shows; not by the breadth of surface over which
400,,"he toils, but by the perfectness of the result which he attains."
401,,Mr. Wordsworth has vindicated the capacity of the sonnet to be
402,,a casket of the richest gems of fame.  We have no doubt that the
403,,song may give evidence of a genius which shall deserve to be ranked
404,,"with the constructor of an epic.  ""Scorn not the SONG.""  We would"
405,,"go so far, indeed, as to say that success in the song imports,"
406,,"necessarily, a more inborn and genuine gift of poetic conception,"
407,,than the same proportion of success in other less simple modes of
408,,art.  There are some sorts of composition which may be wrought out
409,,of eager feeling and the foam of excited passions; and which are
410,,therefore to a large extent within the reach of earnest sensibilities
411,,and an ambitious will; others are the spontaneous outflow of the
412,,"heart, to whose perfection, turbulence and effort are fatal.  Of"
413,,the latter kind is the song.  While the ode allows of exertion
414,,"and strain, what is done in it must be accomplished by native and"
415,,inherent strength.
416,,
417,,Speaking with that confidence which may not improperly be assumed
418,,"by one who, having looked with some care at the foundations of the"
419,,"opinion which he expresses, supposes himself able, if called upon"
420,,"by denial, to furnish such demonstration of its truth as the nature"
421,,"of the matter allows of, we say that, in our judgment, there is"
422,,"no professed writer of songs, in this day, who has conceived the"
423,,"true character of this delicate and peculiar creation of art, with"
424,,"greater precision and justness than Mr. Morris, or been more felicitous"
425,,than he in dealing with the subtle and multiform difficulties that
426,,beset its execution.  It is well understood by those whose thoughts
427,,are used to be conversant with the suggestions of a deeper analysis
428,,"than belongs to popular criticism, that the forms of literary art"
429,,"are not indefinite in number, variable in their characteristics,"
430,,or determined by the casual taste or arbitrary will of authors:
431,,they exist in nature; they are dependent upon those fixed laws of
432,,"intellectual being, of spiritual affection, and moral choice, which"
433,,"constitute the rationality of man.  And the actual, positive merit"
434,,"of a poetical production--that real merit, which consists in native"
435,,"vitality, in inherent capacity to live--does not lie in the glitter"
436,,or costliness of the decorations with which it is invested--nor
437,,in the force with which it is made to spring from the mind of its
438,,creator into the minds of others--nor yet in the scale of magnitude
439,,upon which the ideas belonging to the subject are illustrated in
440,,"the work; but rather, as we suppose, obviously, and in all cases,"
441,,upon the integrity and truth with which the particular form that has
442,,"been contemplated by the artist, is brought out, and the distinctness"
443,,with which that one specific impression which is appropriate to
444,,"it, is attained.  This is the kind of excellence which we ascribe"
445,,"to Mr. Morris; an excellence of a lofty order; genuine, sincere, and"
446,,incapable of question; more valuable in this class of composition
447,,"than in any other, because both more important and more difficult."
448,,For the song appears to us to possess a definiteness peculiarly
449,,jealous and exclusive; to be less flexible in character and to
450,,permit less variety of tone than most other classes of composition.
451,,"If a man shall say, ""I will put more force into my song than your"
452,,"model allows, I will charge it with a greater variety of impressions,"""
453,,"it is well; if he is skilful, he may make something that is very"
454,,"valuable.  But in so far as his work is more than a song, it is not"
455,,a song.  In all works of Art--wherever form is concerned--excess
456,,is error.
457,,
458,,"The just notion and office of the modern song, as we think of it,"
459,,"is to be the embodiment and expression, in beauty, of some one"
460,,"of those sentiments or thoughts, gay, moral, pensive, joyous, or"
461,,"melancholy, which are as natural and appropriate, in particular"
462,,"circumstances, or to certain occasions, as the odor to the flower;"
463,,"rising at such seasons, into the minds of all classes of persons,"
464,,"instinctive and unbidden, yet in obedience to some law of association"
465,,which it is the gift of the poet to apprehend.  Its graceful
466,,"purpose is to exhibit an incident in the substance of an emotion,"
467,,to communicate wisdom in the form of sentiment; it is the refracted
468,,"gleam of some wandering ray from the fair orb of moral truth, which"
469,,"glancing against some occurrence in common life, is surprised into"
470,,"a smile of quick-darting, many colored beauty; it is the airy ripple"
471,,that is thrown up when the current of feeling in human hearts
472,,accidentally encounters the current of thought and bubbles forth
473,,"with a gentle fret of sparkling foam.  Self-evolved, almost, and"
474,,obedient in its development and shaping to some inward spark of
475,,"beauty which appears to possess and control its course, it might"
476,,"almost seem that, in the out-going loveliness of such productions,"
477,,"sentiment made substantial in language, floated abroad in natural"
478,,"self-delivery; as that heat which is not yet flame, gives forth"
479,,"in blue wreaths of vaporous grace, which unfold their delicateness"
480,,"for a moment upon the tranquil air, and then vanish away.  It is"
481,,not an artificial structure built up by intellect after a model
482,,"foreshaped by fancy, or foreshadowed by the instincts of the"
483,,"passions; it is a simple emotion, crystalled into beauty by passing"
484,,for a moment through the cooler air of the mind; it is merely
485,,an effluence of creative vigor; a graceful feeling thickened into
486,,"words.  Its proper dwelling is in the atmosphere of the sentiments,"
487,,"no the passions; it will not, indeed, repel the sympathy of deeper"
488,,"feelings, but knows them rather under the form of the flower that"
489,,"floats upon the surface of meditation, than of the deeper root that"
490,,lies beneath its stream.  And this is the grievous fault of nearly
491,,"all Lord Byron's melodies; that he pierces them too profoundly, and"
492,,"passes below the region of grace, charging his lyre with far more"
493,,vehemence of passion than its slight strings are meant to bear.  The
494,,"beauty which belongs to this production, should be in the form of"
495,,the thought rather than the fashion of the setting:  that genuineness
496,,"and simplicity of character which constitute almost its essence, are"
497,,"destroyed by any appearance of the cold artifices of construction,"
498,,"palpable springs set for our admiration, whereby the beginning"
499,,is obviously arranged in reference to a particular ending.  This
500,,"is the short-reaching power of Moore--guilty, by design, of that"
501,,"departure from simplicity, by which he fascinated one generation"
502,,"at the expense of being forgotten by another.  The song, while it"
503,,"is general in its impression, should be particular in its occasion;"
504,,"not an abstraction of the mind, but a definite feeling, special to"
505,,some certain set of circumstances.  Rising from out the surface of
506,,"daily experience, like the watery issuings of a fountain, it throws"
507,,"itself upward for a moment, then descends in a soft, glittering"
508,,shower to the level whence it rose.  Herein resides the chief defect
509,,of Bayly's songs; that they are too general and vague--a species
510,,"of pattern songs--being embodiments of some general feeling, or"
511,,"reflection, but lacking that sufficient reference to some season"
512,,"or occurrence which would justify their appearing, and take away"
513,,from them the aspect of pretension and display.
514,,
515,,The only satisfactory method of criticism is by means of clinical
516,,lectures; and we feel regret that our limits do not suffer us--to
517,,"any great degree--to illustrate what we deem the vigorous simplicity,"
518,,"and genuine grace of Mr. Morris, by that mode of exposition.  We"
519,,"must refer to a few cases, however, to show what we have been meaning"
520,,"in the remarks which we made above, upon the proper character of"
521,,"the song.  The ballad of ""Woodman, spare that tree""--one of those"
522,,"accidents of genius which, however, never happen but to consummate"
523,,"artists--is so familiar to every mind and heart, as to resent"
524,,"citation.  Take, then, ""My Mother's Bible.""  We know of no similar"
525,,"production in a truer taste, in a purer style, or more distinctly"
526,,marked with the character of a good school of composition.  Or
527,,"take ""We were boys together.""  In manly pathos, in tenderness and"
528,,"truth, where shall it be excelled?  ""The Miniature"" posses the"
529,,"captivating elegance of Voiture.  ""Where Hudson's Wave"" is a glorious"
530,,"burst of poetry, modulated into refinement by the hand of a master."
531,,"Where will you find a nautical song, seemingly more spontaneous in"
532,,"its genial outbreak, really more careful in its construction, than"
533,,"""Land-ho!""  How full of the joyous madness of absolute independence,"
534,,"yet made harmonious by instinctive grace, is ""Life in the West!"""
535,,That the same heart whose wild pulse is thrilled by the adventurous
536,,"interests of the huntsman and the wanderer, can beat in unison"
537,,"with the gentlest truth of deep devotion, is shown in ""When other"
538,,"Friends are round Thee.""  ""I love the Night"" has the voluptuous"
539,,"elegance of the Spanish models.  Were we to meet the lines ""Oh, think"
540,,"of me!"" in an anthology, we should suppose they were Suckling's--so"
541,,admirably is the tone of feeling kept down to the limit of
542,,probable sincerity--which is a characteristic that the cavalier
543,,"style of courting never loses.  ""The Star of Love"" might stand as"
544,,a selected specimen of all that is most exquisite in the songs of
545,,"the ""Trouveurs.""  ""The Seasons of Love"" is a charming effusion of"
546,,"gay, yet thoughtful sentiment.  The song, ""I never have been false"
547,,"to thee,"" is, of itself, sufficient to establish General Morris's"
548,,"fame as a great poet--as a ""potens magister affectuum""--and as"
549,,a literary creator of a high order.  It is a thoroughly fresh and
550,,effective poem on a subject as hackneyed as the highway; it is as
551,,"deep as truth itself, yet light as the movement of a dance.  We had"
552,,"almost forgotten, what the world will never forget, the matchless"
553,,"softness and transparent delicacy of ""Near the Lake.""  Those lines, of"
554,,"themselves, unconsciously, court ""the soft promoter of the poet's"
555,,"strain,"" and almost seem about to break into music.  It is agreeable"
556,,"to find that, instead of being seduced into a false style by the"
557,,"excessive popularity which many of his songs have acquired, General"
558,,Morris's later efforts are in a vein even more truly classic than
559,,"his earlier ones, and show a decided advance, both in power and"
560,,"ease.  ""The Rock of the Pilgrims,"" and the ""Indian Songs,"" are"
561,,a very clear evidence of this.  We would willingly go on with our
562,,"references, as there are several which have equal claims with these"
563,,"upon our notice, but--""claudite jam rivos."""
564,,
565,,"Such are some of the compositions, original in style, natural in"
566,,"spirit, beautiful with the charm of almost faultless execution,"
567,,which may challenge for their author the title of the lauraete of
568,,America....
569,,
570,,"A writer in ""Howitt's and the People's Journal"" furnishes the"
571,,"following sketch of General Morris and his Songs, which was copied"
572,,"and endorsed by the late Dr. Rufus W. Griswold, in his International"
573,,Magazine:--
574,,
575,,"""Before us lies a heap of songs and ballads, the production of"
576,,the rich fancy and warm heart of George P. Morris.  Not many weeks
577,,"since, at a public meeting in London, a gentleman claimed to be"
578,,heard speak on the ground of his connection with the public press
579,,from the time when he was seven years of age.  We will not undertake
580,,to say that General Morris ran his juvenile fingers over the chords
581,,of the lyre at so very early a period; but it is certain he tried
582,,his hand at writing for the newspapers when he was yet but a mere
583,,"boy.  While in his teens, he was a constant contributor to various"
584,,periodicals.  Many of his articles attracted notice.  He began to
585,,"acquire a literary reputation; and at length, in 1823, being then"
586,,"in his twentieth year, he became editor of the 'New York Mirror.'"
587,,This responsible post he continued to hold until the termination
588,,of the paper's existence in 1834.
589,,
590,,"""Morris accomplished an infinity of good in the twenty years"
591,,during which he wielded the editorial pen.  Perhaps no other man in
592,,the United States was so well qualified for the noble task he set
593,,himself at the outset of his career as editor.  American literature
594,,"was in its infancy, and subject to all the weaknesses of that period."
595,,Morris resolved to do his utmost toward forming a character for
596,,"it, and looked abroad anxiously for such as could aid him in his"
597,,"endeavor.  The 'Mirror"" will ever be fondly remembered by the American"
598,,"literary man, for it has been the cradle of American genius."
599,,
600,,"""To him a writer in 'Graham's Magazine' attributes the present"
601,,flourishing condition and bright prospects of transatlantic literature.
602,,"He evidently possesses a personal knowledge of General Morris, and"
603,,discourses right eloquently in his praise.  Nor do we think that
604,,he overrates his merits in the least.  From other sources we have
605,,"ourselves learned much of the genial nature of George P. Morris,"
606,,and his gigantic labors as a literary pioneer.  Considering
607,,"its juvenility as a nation, republican America, indeed, has been"
608,,amazingly prolific of good writers.  The large share Morris has had
609,,"in awakening the latent talent of his countrymen, must ever be to"
610,,"him a high source of gratulation.  And then, as an original writer,"
611,,"he has won for himself a high place among literary Americans; he is,"
612,,"in fact, known throughout the States as 'The Songwriter of America;'"
613,,and we have the authority of Willis for stating that 'ninety-nine
614,,people out of a hundred--take them as they come in the census--would
615,,find more to admire in Morris's Songs than in the writings of any
616,,"other American poet.'  Willis also tells us, as proof of the General's"
617,,"popularity with those shrewd dollar-loving men, the publishers,"
618,,"that 'he can, at any time, obtain fifty dollars for a song unread,"
619,,when the whole remainder of the American Parnassus could not sell
620,,one to the same buyer for a single shilling!'  He is the best-known
621,,poet of the country by acclamation--not by criticism.
622,,
623,,"""Morris seems to have had juster notions of what was required in"
624,,a song than many who have achieved celebrity as song-writers in
625,,England.  'The just office and notion of the modern song' has been
626,,"defined to be, the embodiment and expression in beauty of some"
627,,"thought or sentiment--gay, pensive, moral, or sentimental--which"
628,,is as natural and appropriate in certain circumstances as the odor
629,,to the flower.  Its graceful purpose is to exhibit an incident in
630,,"the substance of an emotion, to communicate wisdom in the form of"
631,,"sentiment.  A song should be the embodiment of some general feeling,"
632,,and have reference to some season or occurrence.
633,,
634,,"""It is not a difficult thing to make words rhyme; some of the most"
635,,unimaginative intellects we ever knew could do so with surprising
636,,facility.  It is rare to find a sentimental miss or a lackadaisical
637,,"master who cannot accomplish this INTELLECTUAL feat, with the help"
638,,"of Walker's Rhyming Dictionary.  As for love, why, every one writes"
639,,about it now-a-days.  There is such an abhorrence of the simple
640,,Saxon--such an outrageous running after outlandish phraseology--that
641,,we wonder folks are satisfied with this plain term.
642,,
643,,"""We wonder they do not seek for an equivalent in high Dutch or in"
644,,"low Dutch, in Hungarian, or in Hindostanee.  We wish they would,"
645,,"with all our heart and soul.  We have no objection, provided the"
646,,"heart be touched, that a head should produce a little of the stuff"
647,,called 'nonsense verses'--that this article should be committed to
648,,"scented note-paper, and carefully sealed up with skewered hearts"
649,,of amazing corpulence.  God forbid that we should be thought guilty
650,,of a sneer at real affection!--far from it; such ever commands our
651,,reverence.  But we do not find it in the noisy tribe of goslings
652,,green who would fain be thought of the nightingale species.  Did
653,,the reader ever contemplate a child engaged in the interesting
654,,operation of sucking a lollipop?--we assure him that that act was
655,,dictated by quite as much of true sentiment as puts in action the
656,,fingers and wits of the generality of our young amatory poetasters.
657,,
658,,"""We know of none who have written more charmingly of love than George"
659,,P. Morris.  Would to Apollo that our rhymsters would condescend to
660,,read carefully his poetical effusions!  But they contain no straining
661,,after effect--no extravagant metaphors--no driveling conceits; and
662,,so there is little fear of their being taken as models by those
663,,gentlemen.  Let the reader mark the surprising excellence of the
664,,love songs; their perfect naturalness; the quiet beauty of the
665,,similes; the fine blending of graceful thought and tender feeling
666,,"which characterize them.  Morris is, indeed, the poet of home joys."
667,,None have described more eloquently the beauty and dignity of true
668,,affection--of passion based upon esteem; and his fame is certain
669,,to endure while the Anglo-Saxon woman has a hearthstone over which
670,,to repeat her most cherished household words.
671,,
672,,"""Seldom have the benign effects of the passion been more felicitously"
673,,painted than in the 'Seasons of Love'; and what simple tenderness
674,,is contained in the ballad of 'We were boys together.'  Every word
675,,in that beautiful melody comes home to the heart of him whose early
676,,days have been happy.  God help those in whom this poem awakens no
677,,fond remembrances!--those whose memories it does not get wandering
678,,"up the stream of life, toward its source; beholding at every step"
679,,"the sun smiling more brightly, the heavens assuming a deeper hue,"
680,,"the grass a fresher green, and the flowers a sweeter perfume.  How"
681,,wondrous are not its effects upon ourselves!  The wrinkles have
682,,"disappeared from our brow, and the years from our shoulder, and"
683,,the marks of the branding-iron of experience from our heart; and
684,,"again we are a careless child, gathering primroses, and chasing"
685,,"butterflies, and drinking spring-water from out the hollow"
686,,of our hands.  Around us are the hedges 'with golden gorse bright
687,,"blossoming, as none blossom now-a-day.'  We have heard of death,"
688,,but we know not what it is; and the word CHANGE has no meaning for
689,,"us; and summer and winter, and seed-time and harvest, has each its"
690,,unutterable joys.  Alas! we can never remain long in this happy
691,,"dream-land.  Nevertheless, we have profited greatly by the journey."
692,,"The cowslips and violets gathered by us in childhood, shall be"
693,,potent in the hour of temptation; and the cap of rushes woven for
694,,"us by kind hands in days gone by, shall be a surer defence than"
695,,"a helmet of steel in the hour of battle.  No, no; we will never"
696,,disgrace our antecedents.
697,,
698,,"""There is one quality in his songs to which we can not but direct"
699,,attention--and this is their almost feminine purity.  The propensities
700,,"have had their laureates; and genius, alas! has often defiled its"
701,,angel wings by contact with the sensual and the impure; but Morris
702,,has never attempted to robe vice in beauty; and as has been well
703,,"remarked, his lays can bring to the cheek of purity no blush save"
704,,"that of pleasure."""
705,,
706,,"The following letter, from the pen of Grace Greenwood, is a lady's"
707,,tribute to the genius of the poet:--
708,,
709,,"""I have read of late, with renewed pleasure and higher appreciation,"
710,,"the songs and ballads of our genial-hearted countryman, Morris.  I"
711,,"had previously worried myself by a course of rather dry reading,"
712,,"and his poetry, tender, musical, fresh, and natural, came to me like"
713,,"spring's first sunshine, the song of her first birds, the breath"
714,,of her first violets.
715,,
716,,"""What a contrast is this pleasant volume to the soul-racking ""Festus,"""
717,,which has been one of my recent passions.  That remarkable work
718,,"has passages of great beauty and power, linked in unnatural marriage"
719,,with much that is poor and weak.  It is like a stately ruined
720,,"palace,"
721,,
722,,
723,,'Mingling its marble with the dust of Rome;'
724,,
725,,
726,,"or it is like its own fabled first temple built to God, in the"
727,,"new earth--a multitude of gems, swallowed by an earthquake, and"
728,,scattered through a world of baser matter.  The soul of the reader
729,,"now faints with excess of beauty, now shudders at the terrible and"
730,,the revolting.  the young poet's muse at times goes like Proserpine
731,,"to gather flowers, but straightway is seized by the lord of the"
732,,"infernal regions, and disappears in flame and darkness.  The entire"
733,,volume is a poetical Archipelago--isles of loveliness sprinkling
734,,a dead sea of unprofitable matter.
735,,
736,,"""It were absurd to compare the light and graceful poems of Morris"
737,,"with the work ""Festus""--a simple Grecian arch with a stupendous"
738,,Turkish mosque--an Etruscan vase with a Gothic tower.  Yet there are
739,,doubtless many who will prefer the perfect realization of modest
740,,"aspirations, to grand, but ineffectual graspings after glory's highest"
741,,"and most divine guerdons--a quiet walk with truth and nature, to"
742,,an Icarus flight of magnificent absurdities.
743,,
744,,"""It has been said that the author of 'Long time ago' has rung"
745,,"too many changes on the sentiment and passion of LOVE.  Love, the"
746,,"inspiration of the glorious bards of old,"
747,,
748,,
749,,"'Who play upon the heart as on a harp,"
750,,And make our eyes bright as we speak of them;'
751,,
752,,
753,,"'love ever-new, everlasting, fresh, and beautiful, now as when"
754,,"the silence of young Eden was thrilled, but scarce broken, by the"
755,,voice of the first lover--a joy and a source of joy for ever.'
756,,
757,,"""I know it is much the fashion now-a-days, to hold in lordly contempt"
758,,many of those sweet and holy influences which are--
759,,
760,,"'As angel hands, enclosing ours,"
761,,Leading us back to Paradisean bowers.'
762,,
763,,
764,,"""Love and liberty are fast becoming mere abstractions to the"

766,,how soon those white-winged visitors soil their plumage and change
767,,their very nature by a mere descent into the philosophic atmosphere
768,,of such mind.  One is reminded of the words of Swedenborg--'I saw

898,A LIE.',Willis.  We have a dash of his pencil in the following letter to
899,A LIE.',"the editor of ""Graham's Magazine"":--"
900,A LIE.',
901,A LIE.',"""My Dear Sir:  To ask me for my idea of General Morris, is like"
902,A LIE.',asking the left hand's opinion of the dexterity of the right.  I have
903,A LIE.',lived so long with the 'Brigadier'--know him so intimately--worked
904,A LIE.',"so constantly at the same rope, and thought so little of ever"
905,A LIE.',separating from him (except by precedence of ferriage over the
906,A LIE.',"Styx), that it is hard to shove him from me to the perspective"
907,A LIE.',"distance--hard to shut my own partial eyes, and look at him through"
908,A LIE.',"other people's.  I will try, however; and, as it is done with but"
909,A LIE.',"one foot off from the treadmill of my ceaseless vocation, you will"
910,A LIE.',excuse both abruptness and brevity.
911,A LIE.',
912,A LIE.',"""Morris is the best-known poet of the country, by acclamation, not"
913,A LIE.',"by criticism.  He is just what poets would be if they sang, like"
914,A LIE.',"birds, without criticism; and it is a peculiarity of his fame, that"
915,A LIE.',"it seems as regardless of criticism, as a bird in the air.  Nothing"
916,A LIE.',can stop a song of his.  It is very easy to say that they are
917,A LIE.',"easy to do.  They have a momentum, somehow, that it is difficult"
918,A LIE.',"for others to give, and that speeds them to the far goal of"
919,A LIE.',"popularity--the best proof consisting in the fact that he can, at"
920,A LIE.',"any moment, get fifty dollars for a song unread, when the whole"
921,A LIE.',remainder of the American Parnassus could not sell one to the same
922,A LIE.',buyer for a shilling.
923,A LIE.',
924,A LIE.',"""It may, or may not, be one secret of his popularity, but it is the"
925,A LIE.',"truth--that Morris's heart is at the level of most other people's,"
926,A LIE.',and his poetry flows out by that door.  He stands breast-high in the
927,A LIE.',"common stream of sympathy, and the fine oil of his poetic feeling"
928,A LIE.',"goes from him upon an element it is its nature to float upon, and"
929,A LIE.',"which carries it safe to other bosoms, with little need of deep"
930,A LIE.',"diving or high flying.  His sentiments are simple, honest, truthful,"
931,A LIE.',"and familiar; his language is pure and eminently musical, and he"
932,A LIE.',is prodigally full of the poetry of every-day feeling.  These are
933,A LIE.',days when poets try experiments; and while others succeed by taking
934,A LIE.',"the world's breath away with flights and plunges, Morris uses his"
935,A LIE.',"feet to walk quietly with nature.  Ninety-nine people in a hundred,"
936,A LIE.',"taken as they come in the census, would find more to admire in"
937,A LIE.',"Morris's songs, than in the writings of any other American poet;"
938,A LIE.',"and that is a parish in the poetical episcopate, well worthy a wise"
939,A LIE.',man's nurture and prizing.
940,A LIE.',
941,A LIE.',"""As for the man--Morris, my friend--I can hardly venture to 'burn"
942,A LIE.',"incense on his moustache,' as the French say--write his praises"
943,A LIE.',"under his very nose--but as far off as Philadelphia, you may pay"
944,A LIE.',the proper tribute to his loyal nature and manly excellencies.
945,A LIE.',His personal qualities have made him universally popular; but this
946,A LIE.',overflow upon the world does not impoverish him for his friends.  I
947,A LIE.',"have outlined a true poet, and a fine fellow--fill up the picture"
948,A LIE.',"to your liking.  Yours, very truly,"
949,A LIE.',
950,A LIE.',"""N. P. Willis."""
951,A LIE.',
952,A LIE.',"In 1825, General Morris wrote the drama of ""Briercliff,"" a play,"
953,A LIE.',"in five acts, founded upon events of the American Revolution.  It"
954,A LIE.',was performed forty nights in succession; and the manager paid him
955,A LIE.',"for it $3,500--a solid proof of its attractive popularity.  It has"
956,A LIE.',"never been published.  Prior, and subsequent to this period, his"
957,A LIE.',pen was actively engaged upon various literary and dramatic works.
958,A LIE.',
959,A LIE.',"He wrote a number of the ""Welcomes to Lafayette,"" and songs and"
960,A LIE.',"ballads, which were universally popular, besides many prologues"
961,A LIE.',and addresses.
962,A LIE.',
963,A LIE.',"In 1842, he wrote an opera for Mr. C. E. Horn, called the ""Maid of"
964,A LIE.',"Saxony,"" which was performed fourteen nights, with great success,"
965,A LIE.',"at the Park Theatre.  The press of the city, generally, awarded to"
966,A LIE.',this opera the highest commendation.
967,A LIE.',
968,A LIE.',From the period when General Morris commenced his career as
969,A LIE.',"a writer, his pen has been constantly employed in writing poems,"
970,A LIE.',"songs, ballads, and prose sketches."
971,A LIE.',
972,A LIE.',"In 1840, the Appletons published an edition of his poems, beautifully"
973,A LIE.',"illustrated by Weir & Chapman; in 1842, Paine & Burgess published"
974,A LIE.',"his songs and ballads; and in 1853, Scribner's edition, illustrated"
975,A LIE.',"by Weir and Darley, appeared.  This last beautiful work has had an"
976,A LIE.',immense sale.
977,A LIE.',
978,A LIE.',"They were highly commended by the press throughout the country,"
979,A LIE.',and these and other editions have had large sales.  A portion of
980,A LIE.',"his prose writings, under the title of ""The Little Frenchman and"
981,A LIE.',"his Water-Lots,"" were published by Lea & Blanchard, which edition"
982,A LIE.',"has been followed by others, enlarged by the author."
983,A LIE.',
984,A LIE.',General Morris has edited a number of works; among them are the
985,A LIE.',"""Atlantic Club Book,"" published by the Harpers; ""The Song-Writers of"
986,A LIE.',"America,"" by Linen & Ferin; ""National Melodies,"" by Horn & Davis;"
987,A LIE.',"and, in connection with Mr. Willis, ""The Prose and Poetry of Europe"
988,A LIE.',"and America,"" a standard work of great value."
989,A LIE.',
990,A LIE.',"In 1844, in connection with Mr. Willis, he established a beautiful"
991,A LIE.',"weekly paper, called the ""New Mirror,"" which, in consequence of"
992,A LIE.',"the cover and engravings, was taxed by the post-office department"
993,A LIE.',a postage equal to the subscription price; and not being able to
994,A LIE.',"obtain a just reduction from Mr. Wickliffe, then post-master-general,"
995,A LIE.',"the proprietors discontinued its publication, after a year and a"
996,A LIE.',"half, notwithstanding it had attained a circulation of ten thousand"
997,A LIE.',copies.
998,A LIE.',
999,A LIE.',"The daily ""Evening Mirror"" was next commenced, and continued for"
1000,A LIE.',one year by Morris & Willis.
1001,A LIE.',
1002,A LIE.',"A few months after withdrawing from the ""Evening Mirror,"" General"
1003,A LIE.',"Morris began the publication of the ""National Press and Home"
1004,A LIE.',"Journal;"" but as many mistook its object from its name, the first"
1005,A LIE.',"part of its title was discontinued; and in November, 1846 (Mr."
1006,A LIE.',"Willis having again joined his old friend and associate), appeared"
1007,A LIE.',"the first number of the ""Home Journal,"" a weekly paper, published"
1008,A LIE.',"in New York every Saturday, which is edited with taste, spirit,"
1009,A LIE.',"and ability, and which has a circulation of many thousand copies."
1010,A LIE.',
1011,A LIE.',"General Morris is still in the prime and vigor  of life, and it"
1012,A LIE.',is not unlikely that the public will yet have much to admire from
1013,A LIE.',"his pen, and which will, without doubt, place him still higher in"
1014,A LIE.',"the niche of fame.  His residence is chiefly at Undercliff, his"
1015,A LIE.',"country seat, on the banks of the Hudson, near Cold Spring, surrounded"
1016,A LIE.',"by the most lovely and beautiful scenery in nature, which can not"
1017,A LIE.',"fail to keep the muse alive within him, and tune the minstrel to"
1018,A LIE.',further and still higher efforts.
1019,A LIE.',
1020,A LIE.',Although he possesses abilities which eminently qualify him for
1021,A LIE.',"public station, his literary taste and habits have, in spite of"
1022,A LIE.',"the strenuous solicitations of his friends, led him to prefer the"
1023,A LIE.',"retirement of private life.  This, however, does not prevent his"
1024,A LIE.',taking an active interest in all questions of public good; and the
1025,A LIE.',city of New York is greatly indebted to his vigorous aid for many
1026,A LIE.',of her most beautiful and permanent improvements.

9982,FINALE.,"a blight has recently come, he invited me to turn down a little romantic woodland"
9983,FINALE.,"pass not far from Bloomingdale.  ""Your object?"" inquired I.  ""Merely to look once"
9984,FINALE.,"more at an old tree planted by my grandfather, near a cottage that was once my"
9985,FINALE.,"father's.""--""The place is yours, then?"" said I.  ""No, my poor mother sold it;"" and"
9986,FINALE.,"I observed a slight quiver of the lip, at the recollection of that circumstance."
9987,FINALE.,"""Dear mother!"" resumed my companion, ""we passed many happy, HAPPY days, in that old"
9988,FINALE.,"cottage; but it is nothing to me now--father, mother, sisters, cottage--all are"
9989,FINALE.,"gone!""--and a paleness over-spread his fine countenance, and a moisture came to his"
9990,FINALE.,"eyes, as he spoke.  After a moment's pause, he added:  ""Don't think me foolish.  I"
9991,FINALE.,"don't know how it is, I never ride out but I turn down this lane to look at that"
9992,FINALE.,"old tree.  I have a thousand recollections about it, and I always greet it as a familiar"
9993,FINALE.,and well-remembered friend.  In the by-gone summer-time it was a friend indeed.
9994,FINALE.,"Under its branches I often listened to the good counsel of my parents, and had"
9995,FINALE.,"SUCH gambols with my sisters!  Its leaves are all off now, so you won't see it to"
9996,FINALE.,"advantage, for it is a glorious old fellow in summer; but I like it full as well in"
9997,FINALE.,"winter-time.""  These words were scarcely uttered, when my companion cried out, ""There"
9998,FINALE.,"it is?""  Near the tree stood an old man, with his coat off, sharpening an ax.  He"
9999,FINALE.,"was the occupant of the cottage.  ""What do you intend doing?"" asked my friend with"
10000,FINALE.,"great anxiety.  ""What is that to you?"" was the blunt reply.  ""You are not going to"
10001,FINALE.,"cut that tree down, surely?""--""Yes, but I am though,"" said the woodman.  ""What for?"""
10002,FINALE.,"inquired my companion, almost choked with emotion.  ""What for?  Why, because I think"
10003,FINALE.,"proper to do so.  What for?  I like that!  Well, I'll tell you what for.  This tree"
10004,FINALE.,makes my dwelling unhealthy; it stands too near the house:  prevents the moisture
10005,FINALE.,"from exhaling, and renders us liable to fever-and-ague.""--""Who told you that?""--""Dr."
10006,FINALE.,"S---.""--""Have you any other reason for wishing to cut it down?""--""Yes, I am getting"
10007,FINALE.,"old; the woods are a great way off, and this tree is of some value to me to burn."""
10008,FINALE.,"He was soon convinced, however, that the story about the fever-and-ague was a mere"
10009,FINALE.,"fiction, for there never had been a case of that disease in the neighborhood; and"
10010,FINALE.,"then was asked what the tree was worth for firewood.  ""Why, when it is down, about"
10011,FINALE.,"ten dollars.""  ""Suppose I make you a present of that amount, will you let it"
10012,FINALE.,"stand?""--""Yes.""--""You are sure of that?""--""Positive.""--""Then give me a bond to that"
10013,FINALE.,"effect.""  I drew it up; it was witnessed by his daughter; the money was paid, and"
10014,FINALE.,"we left the place with an assurance from the young girl, who looked as smiling and"
10015,FINALE.,"beautiful as Hebe, that the tree should stand as long as she lived.  We returned to"
10016,FINALE.,"the road, and pursued our ride.  These circumstances made a strong impression upon"

10025,FINALE.,"thrill of admiration, and to reflect the highest honor on her name.  The most memorable"
10026,FINALE.,"event of her life is this recorded:  After a long consultation among the Indians,"
10027,FINALE.,"the fate of Captain Smith, who was the leader of the first colony in Virginia, was"
10028,FINALE.,decided.  The conclave resumed their silent gravity.  Two huge stones were placed
10029,FINALE.,"near the water's edge; Smith was lashed to them, and his head was laid down, as a"
10030,FINALE.,preparation for beating out his brains with war-clubs.  Powhattan raised the fatal
10031,FINALE.,"instrument, and the savage multitude with their blood-stained weapons stood near their"
10032,FINALE.,"king, silently waiting the prisoner's last moment.  But Smith was not destined to"
10033,FINALE.,"thus perish.  Pocahontas, the beloved daughter of the king, rushed forward, fell upon"
10034,FINALE.,"her knees, and, with tears and entreaties, prayed that the victim might be spared."
10035,FINALE.,"The royal savage rejected her suit, and commanded her to leave Smith to his fate."
10036,FINALE.,"Grown frantic at the failure of her supplications, Pocahontas threw her arms about"
10037,FINALE.,"Smith, and laid her head on his, her raven hair falling around his neck and shoulders,"
10038,FINALE.,"declaring she would perish with or save him.  The Indians gasped for breath, fearing"
10039,FINALE.,that Powhatan would slay his child for taking such a deep interest in the fate of
10040,FINALE.,one he considered his deadliest foe.  But human nature is the same everywhere; the
10041,FINALE.,"war-club dropped from the monarch's hand--his brow relaxed--his heart softened; and,"
10042,FINALE.,"as he raised his brave daughter to his bosom, and kissed her forehead, he reversed"
10043,FINALE.,"his decree, and directed Smith to be set at liberty!  Whether the regard of this"
10044,FINALE.,"glorious girl for Smith ever reached the feeling of love, is not known.  No favor"
10045,FINALE.,"was ever expected in return.  'I ask nothing of Captain Smith,' said she, in an"
10046,FINALE.,"interview she afterward had with him in England, 'in recompense for what I have done,"
10047,FINALE.,but the boon of living in his memory.'  John Randolph was a lineal descendant of this
10048,FINALE.,"noble woman, and was wont to pride himself upon the honor of his descent.  Pocahontas"

10057,FINALE.,to save her life.  The prospect of their separation almost maddened her.  To sever
10058,FINALE.,"her long, jetty ringlets from her exquisite head--to dress in male attire--to enroll"
10059,FINALE.,"herself in the corps to which he belonged, and follow his fortunes in the wars, unknown"

10075,FINALE.,"""We seated ourselves in the shade of a large pine-tree, and drank of a spring that"
10076,FINALE.,"gurgled beneath it.  The Indians gave a groan, and turned their faces from the water."
10077,FINALE.,"They would not drink of the spring, nor eat in the shade of the tree; but retired"
10078,FINALE.,to a ledge of rocks at no great distance.  I ventured to approach them and inquire
10079,FINALE.,"the cause of their strange conduct.  One of the Indians said, in a deep and solemn"
10080,FINALE.,"tone:  'That place is bad for the red-man; the blood of an innocent woman, not of"
10081,FINALE.,"our enemies, rests upon that spot!--She was there murdered.  The red-man's word had"
10082,FINALE.,been pledged for her safety; but the evil spirit made him forget it.  She lies buried
10083,FINALE.,"there.  No one avenged her murder, and the Great Spirit was angry.  That water will"
10084,FINALE.,"make us more thirsty, and that shade will scorch us.  The stain of blood is on our"
10085,FINALE.,"hands, and we know not how to wipe it out.  It still rests upon us, do what we will.'"
10086,FINALE.,"I could get no more from them; they were silent, even for Indians.  It was the death"
10087,FINALE.,of Miss McRea they alluded to.  She was betrothed to a young American by the name
10088,FINALE.,"of Jones, who had taken sides with the British, and become a captain of their service."
10089,FINALE.,"The lovers, however, had managed to keep up a correspondence; and he was informed,"
10090,FINALE.,"after a battle in which he distinguished himself for his bravery, that his inamorata"
10091,FINALE.,was concealed in a house a few miles from Sandy-Hill.  As it was dangerous for him
10092,FINALE.,to take his horse to her residence and bring her to his tent in safety.  He urged
10093,FINALE.,"her, in his letter, not to hesitate a moment in putting herself under their protection;"
10094,FINALE.,"and the voice of a lover is law to a confiding woman.  They proceeded on their journey,"
10095,FINALE.,and stopped to rest under a large pine-tree near a spring--the one at which we drank.
10096,FINALE.,"Here they were met by another party of Indians, also sent by the impatient lover,"
10097,FINALE.,when a quarrel arouse about her which terminated in her assassination.  One of the
10098,FINALE.,Indians pulled the poor girl from her horse; and another struck his tomahawk in her
10099,FINALE.,"forehead, tore off her scalp, and gashed her breast!  They then covered her body with"
10100,FINALE.,"leaves, and left her under the huge pine-tree.  One of the Indians made her lover"
10101,FINALE.,"acquainted with the facts, and another brought him her scalp.  He knew the long brown"
10102,FINALE.,"tresses of Miss McRea, and, in defiance of all danger, flew to the spot to realize"
10103,FINALE.,the horrid scene.  He tore away the thinly-spread leaves--clasped the still-bleeding
10104,FINALE.,"body in his arms, and, wrapping it in his cloak, was about bearing it away, when he"
10105,FINALE.,"was prevented by his superior officers, who ordered the poor girl to be buried on"
10106,FINALE.,the spot where she had been immolated.  After this event a curse seemed to rest upon
10107,FINALE.,the red-man.  In every battle their forces were sadly cut up--the Americans attacking
10108,FINALE.,them most furiously whenever they could get an opportunity.  The prophets of the
10109,FINALE.,Indians had strange auguries; they saw constantly in the clouds the form of the
10110,FINALE.,"murdered white woman, invoking the blasts to overwhelm them, and direction all the"
10111,FINALE.,power and fury of the Americans to exterminate every red-man of the forest who had
10112,FINALE.,committed the hateful deed of breaking his faith and staining the tomahawk with the
10113,FINALE.,"blood of a woman, whose spirit still called for revenge.  It was agreed among the"
10114,FINALE.,Indians in a body to move silently away; and by morning's light not a red-man was
10115,FINALE.,"to be found near the British troops.  Captain Jones, too, was no more.  In the"
10116,FINALE.,battle he led on his men with that fearlessness and fury that distressed minds
10117,FINALE.,"often do; but his men grew tired of following him in such perilous attacks, and"
10118,FINALE.,began to fly.  As he returned to rally them he received a ball in the back.  Burning
10119,FINALE.,"with shame, love, and frenzy, he tuned and threw himself on the bayonets of the"
10120,FINALE.,"enemy, and at once closed his agonies and expiated his political offence.  He was"
