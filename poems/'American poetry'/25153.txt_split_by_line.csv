221,THE WAYSIDE INN.,
222,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Before the blazing fire of wood
223,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Erect the rapt musician stood;
224,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And ever and anon he bent
225,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"His head upon his instrument,"
226,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And seemed to listen, till he caught"
227,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Confessions of its secret thought,--"
228,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The joy, the triumph, the lament,"
229,THE WAYSIDE INN.,The exultation and the pain;
230,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Then, by the magic of his art,"
231,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"He soothed the throbbings of its heart,"
232,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And lulled it into peace again.
233,THE WAYSIDE INN.,
234,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Around the fireside at their ease
235,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"There sat a group of friends, entranced"
236,THE WAYSIDE INN.,With the delicious melodies;
237,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Who from the far-off noisy town
238,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Had to the wayside inn come down,"
239,THE WAYSIDE INN.,To rest beneath its old oak-trees.
240,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The fire-light on their faces glanced,"
241,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Their shadows on the wainscot danced,"
242,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And, though of different lands and speech,"
243,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Each had his tale to tell, and each"
244,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Was anxious to be pleased and please.
245,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And while the sweet musician plays,"
246,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Let me in outline sketch them all,"
247,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Perchance uncouthly as the blaze

249,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Their shadowy semblance on the wall.
250,THE WAYSIDE INN.,
251,THE WAYSIDE INN.,But first the Landlord will I trace;
252,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Grave in his aspect and attire;
253,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A man of ancient pedigree,"
254,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A Justice of the Peace was he,"
255,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Known in all Sudbury as ""The Squire."""
256,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Proud was he of his name and race,"
257,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Of old Sir William and Sir Hugh,"
258,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And in the parlor, full in view,"
259,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"His coat-of-arms, well framed and glazed,"
260,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Upon the wall in colors blazed;
261,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"He beareth gules upon his shield,"
262,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A chevron argent in the field,"
263,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"With three wolf's heads, and for the crest"
264,THE WAYSIDE INN.,A Wyvern part-per-pale addressed
265,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Upon a helmet barred; below
266,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The scroll reads, ""By the name of Howe."""
267,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And over this, no longer bright,"
268,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Though glimmering with a latent light,"
269,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Was hung the sword his grandsire bore,"
270,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"In the rebellious days of yore,"
271,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Down there at Concord in the fight.
272,THE WAYSIDE INN.,
273,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A youth was there, of quiet ways,"
274,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A Student of old books and days,"
275,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"To whom all tongues and lands were known,"
276,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And yet a lover of his own;
277,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"With many a social virtue graced,"
278,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And yet a friend of solitude;
279,THE WAYSIDE INN.,A man of such a genial mood
280,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The heart of all things he embraced,"
281,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And yet of such fastidious taste,"
282,THE WAYSIDE INN.,He never found the best too good.
283,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Books were his passion and delight,"
284,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And in his upper room at home
285,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Stood many a rare and sumptuous tome,"
286,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"In vellum bound, with gold bedight,"
287,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Great volumes garmented in white,"
288,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Recalling Florence, Pisa, Rome."
289,THE WAYSIDE INN.,He loved the twilight that surrounds
290,THE WAYSIDE INN.,The border-land of old romance;
291,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Where glitter hauberk, helm, and lance,"
292,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And banner waves, and trumpet sounds,"
293,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And ladies ride with hawk on wrist,"
294,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And mighty warriors sweep along,"
295,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Magnified by the purple mist,"
296,THE WAYSIDE INN.,The dusk of centuries and of song.
297,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The chronicles of Charlemagne,"
298,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Of Merlin and the Mort d'Arthure,"
299,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Mingled together in his brain
300,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"With tales of Flores and Blanchefleur,"

305,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A young Sicilian, too, was there;--"
306,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"In sight of Etna born and bred,"
307,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Some breath of its volcanic air
308,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Was glowing in his heart and brain,"
309,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"And, being rebellious to his liege,"
310,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"After Palermo's fatal siege,"
311,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Across the western seas he fled,"
312,THE WAYSIDE INN.,In good King Bomba's happy reign.
313,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"His face was like a summer night,"
314,THE WAYSIDE INN.,All flooded with a dusky light;
315,THE WAYSIDE INN.,His hands were small; his teeth shone white
316,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"As sea-shells, when he smiled or spoke;"
317,THE WAYSIDE INN.,His sinews supple and strong as oak;
318,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Clean shaven was he as a priest,"
319,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Who at the mass on Sunday sings,"
320,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Save that upon his upper lip
321,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"His beard, a good palm's length at least,"
322,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Level and pointed at the tip,"
323,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Shot sideways, like a swallow's wings."
324,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The poets read he o'er and o'er,"

326,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Of Italy; and next to those,"
327,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The story-telling bard of prose,"
328,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Who wrote the joyous Tuscan tales
329,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Of the Decameron, that make"
330,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Fiesole's green hills and vales
331,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Remembered for Boccaccio's sake.
332,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Much too of music was his thought;
333,THE WAYSIDE INN.,The melodies and measures fraught
334,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"With sunshine and the open air,"
335,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Of vineyards and the singing sea
336,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Of his beloved Sicily;
337,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And much it pleased him to peruse

345,THE WAYSIDE INN.,A Spanish Jew from Alicant

355,THE WAYSIDE INN.,His garments breathed a spicy scent
356,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Of cinnamon and sandal blent,"
357,THE WAYSIDE INN.,Like the soft aromatic gales
358,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"That meet the mariner, who sails"

372,THE WAYSIDE INN.,As if in vision or in trance
373,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"He heard the solemn sackbut play,"
374,THE WAYSIDE INN.,And saw the Jewish maidens dance.

376,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A Theologian, from the school"

453,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"Whose music had so weird a sound,"
454,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"The hunted stag forgot to bound,"

465,THE WAYSIDE INN.,"A ghostly murmur of acclaim,"

582,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,It was twelve by the village clock
583,PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.,When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.

708,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"On a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves,"
709,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Ser Federigo sat among the leaves
710,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Of a huge vine, that, with its arms outspread,"
711,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Hung its delicious clusters overhead.

716,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"To him a marble tomb, that rose above"
717,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,His wasted fortunes and his buried love.

724,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
725,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Then he withdrew, in poverty and pain,"
726,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"To this small farm, the last of his domain,"

733,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch,"
734,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch.
735,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Companion of his solitary ways,"
736,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Purveyor of his feasts on holidays,"
737,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,On him this melancholy man bestowed

743,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And dreamily before his half-closed sight
744,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Floated the vision of his lost delight.
745,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Beside him, motionless, the drowsy bird"
746,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Dreamed of the chase, and in his slumber heard"
747,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The sudden, scythe-like sweep of wings, that dare"
748,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The headlong plunge thro' eddying gulfs of air,"
749,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Then, starting broad awake upon his perch,"
750,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Tinkled his bells, like mass-bells in a church,"
751,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And, looking at his master, seemed to say,"
752,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Ser Federigo, shall we hunt to-day?"""
753,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
754,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Ser Federigo thought not of the chase;
755,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The tender vision of her lovely face,"
756,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"I will not say he seems to see, he sees"
757,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"In the leaf-shadows of the trellises,"
758,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Herself, yet not herself; a lovely child"
759,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"With flowing tresses, and eyes wide and wild,"
760,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Coming undaunted up the garden walk,"
761,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And looking not at him, but at the hawk."
762,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Beautiful falcon!"" said he, ""would that I"
763,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Might hold thee on my wrist, or see thee fly!"""
764,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The voice was hers, and made strange echoes start"
765,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Through all the haunted chambers of his heart,"
766,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,As an Êolian harp through gusty doors
767,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Of some old ruin its wild music pours.
768,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
769,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Who is thy mother, my fair boy?"" he said,"
770,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,His hand laid softly on that shining head.
771,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Monna Giovanna.--Will you let me stay"
772,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"A little while, and with your falcon play?"
773,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"We live there, just beyond your garden wall,"
774,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"In the great house behind the poplars tall."""
775,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
776,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,So he spake on; and Federigo heard
777,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"As from afar each softly uttered word,"
778,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And drifted onward through the golden gleams
779,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And shadows of the misty sea of dreams,"
780,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"As mariners becalmed through vapors drift,"
781,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift,"
782,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And hear far off the mournful breakers roar,"
783,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And voices calling faintly from the shore!
784,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Then, waking from his pleasant reveries,"
785,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"He took the little boy upon his knees,"
786,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And told him stories of his gallant bird,"
787,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Till in their friendship he became a third.
788,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
789,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Monna Giovanna, widowed in her prime,"
790,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Had come with friends to pass the summer time
791,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"In her grand villa, half-way up the hill,"
792,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"O'erlooking Florence, but retired and still;"
793,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"With iron gates, that opened through long lines"
794,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Of sacred ilex and centennial pines,"
795,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And terraced gardens, and broad steps of stone,"
796,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And sylvan deities, with moss o'ergrown,"
797,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And fountains palpitating in the heat,"
798,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And all Val d'Arno stretched beneath its feet.
799,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Here in seclusion, as a widow may,"
800,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The lovely lady whiled the hours away,"
801,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Pacing in sable robes the statued hall,"
802,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Herself the stateliest statue among all,"
803,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And seeing more and more, with secret joy,"
804,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Her husband risen and living in her boy,"
805,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Till the lost sense of life returned again,"
806,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Not as delight, but as relief from pain."
807,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Meanwhile the boy, rejoicing in his strength,"
808,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Stormed down the terraces from length to length;
809,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit,"
810,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And climbed the garden trellises for fruit.
811,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,But his chief pastime was to watch the flight
812,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Of a gerfalcon, soaring into sight,"
813,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall,"
814,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Then downward stooping at some distant call;
815,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And as he gazed full often wondered he
816,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Who might the master of the falcon be,"
817,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Until that happy morning, when he found"
818,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Master and falcon in the cottage ground.
819,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
820,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And now a shadow and a terror fell
821,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"On the great house, as if a passing-bell"
822,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Tolled from the tower, and filled each spacious room"
823,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"With secret awe, and preternatural gloom;"
824,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The petted boy grew ill, and day by day"
825,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Pined with mysterious malady away.
826,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,The mother's heart would not be comforted;
827,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Her darling seemed to her already dead,"
828,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And often, sitting by the sufferer's side,"
829,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""What can I do to comfort thee?"" she cried."
830,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"At first the silent lips made no reply,"
831,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"But, moved at length by her importunate cry,"
832,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Give me,"" he answered, with imploring tone,"
833,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Ser Federigo's falcon for my own!"""
834,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
835,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,No answer could the astonished mother make;
836,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"How could she ask, e'en for her darling's sake,"
837,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Such favor at a luckless lover's hand,"
838,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Well knowing that to ask was to command?
839,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Well knowing, what all falconers confessed,"
840,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"In all the land that falcon was the best,"
841,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The master's pride and passion and delight,"
842,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And the sole pursuivant of this poor knight.
843,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"But yet, for her child's sake, she could no less"
844,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Than give assent, to soothe his restlessness,"
845,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"So promised, and then promising to keep"
846,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Her promise sacred, saw him fall asleep."
847,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
848,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,The morrow was a bright September morn;
849,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,The earth was beautiful as if new-born;
850,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"There was that nameless splendor everywhere,"
851,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"That wild exhilaration in the air,"
852,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Which makes the passers in the city street
853,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Congratulate each other as they meet.
854,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Two lovely ladies, clothed in cloak and hood,"
855,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Passed through the garden gate into the wood,"
856,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Under the lustrous leaves, and through the sheen"
857,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Of dewy sunshine showering down between.
858,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
859,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The one, close-hooded, had the attractive grace"
860,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Which sorrow sometimes lends a woman's face;
861,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll
862,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,From the gulf-stream of passion in the soul;
863,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The other with her hood thrown back, her hair"
864,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Making a golden glory in the air,"
865,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush,"
866,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Her young heart singing louder than the thrush.
867,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"So walked, that morn, through mingled light and shade,"
868,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Each by the other's presence lovelier made,"
869,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Monna Giovanna and her bosom friend,"
870,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Intent upon their errand and its end.
871,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
872,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"They found Ser Federigo at his toil,"
873,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Like banished Adam, delving in the soil;"
874,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And when he looked and these fair women spied,"
875,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,The garden suddenly was glorified;
876,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"His long-lost Eden was restored again,"
877,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And the strange river winding through the plain
878,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"No longer was the Arno to his eyes,"
879,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,But the Euphrates watering Paradise!
880,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
881,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Monna Giovanna raised her stately head,"
882,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And with fair words of salutation said:
883,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""Ser Federigo, we come here as friends,"
884,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Hoping in this to make some poor amends
885,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,For past unkindness. I who ne'er before
886,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Would even cross the threshold of your door,"
887,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"I who in happier days such pride maintained,"
888,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Refused your banquets, and your gifts disdained,"
889,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"This morning come, a self-invited guest,"
890,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"To put your generous nature to the test,"
891,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And breakfast with you under your own vine."""
892,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"To which he answered: ""Poor desert of mine,"
893,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Not your unkindness call it, for if aught"
894,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Is good in me of feeling or of thought,"
895,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"From you it comes, and this last grace outweighs"
896,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"All sorrows, all regrets of other days."""
897,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
898,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And after further compliment and talk,"
899,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Among the dahlias in the garden walk
900,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"He left his guests; and to his cottage turned,"
901,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And as he entered for a moment yearned
902,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"For the lost splendors of the days of old,"
903,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The ruby glass, the silver and the gold,"
904,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And felt how piercing is the sting of pride,"
905,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,By want embittered and intensified.
906,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,He looked about him for some means or way
907,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,To keep this unexpected holiday;
908,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Searched every cupboard, and then searched again,"
909,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Summoned the maid, who came, but came in vain;"
910,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""The Signor did not hunt to-day,"" she said,"
911,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""There's nothing in the house but wine and bread."""
912,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
913,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook
914,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"His little bells, with that sagacious look,"
915,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Which said, as plain as language to the ear,"
916,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"""If anything is wanting, I am here!"""
917,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Yes, everything is wanting, gallant bird!"
918,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The master seized thee without further word,"
919,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Like thine own lure, he whirled thee round; ah me!"
920,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The pomp and flutter of brave falconry,"
921,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The bells, the jesses, the bright scarlet hood,"
922,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The flight and the pursuit o'er field and wood,"
923,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,All these forevermore are ended now;
924,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"No longer victor, but the victim thou!"
925,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
926,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Then on the board a snow-white cloth he spread,"
927,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread,"
928,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot,"
929,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The fragrant peach, the juicy bergamot;"
930,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Then in the midst a flask of wine he placed,"
931,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And with autumnal flowers the banquet graced.
932,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Ser Federigo, would not these suffice"
933,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice?
934,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
935,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"When all was ready, and the courtly dame"
936,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"With her companion to the cottage came,"
937,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,Upon Ser Federigo's brain there fell
938,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,The wild enchantment of a magic spell;
939,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"The room they entered, mean and low and small,"
940,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Was changed into a sumptuous banquet-hall,"
941,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,With fanfares by aerial trumpets blown;
942,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,The rustic chair she sat on was a throne;
943,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"He ate celestial food, and a divine"
944,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Flavor was given to his country wine,"
945,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"And the poor falcon, fragrant with his spice,"
946,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"A peacock was, or bird of paradise!"
947,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,
948,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"When the repast was ended, they arose"
949,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,And passed again into the garden-close.
950,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Then said the lady, ""Far too well I know,"
951,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Remembering still the days of long ago,"
952,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"Though you betray it not, with what surprise"
953,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,You see me here in this familiar wise.
954,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"You have no children, and you cannot guess"
955,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"What anguish, what unspeakable distress"
956,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO.,"A mother feels, whose child is lying ill,"

3457,TORQUEMADA.,Pursued the flying phantom of his brain.
3458,TORQUEMADA.,He watched them even when they knelt in church;
3459,TORQUEMADA.,"And then, descending lower in his search,"

3526,TORQUEMADA.,
3527,TORQUEMADA.,"A sacred frenzy seized the father's brain,"
3528,TORQUEMADA.,And Mercy from that hour implored in vain.
3529,TORQUEMADA.,Ah! who will e'er believe the words I say?
3530,TORQUEMADA.,"His daughters he accused, and the same day"

3533,TORQUEMADA.,"Arraigned, condemned, and sentenced to the flame,"
3534,TORQUEMADA.,The secret torture and the public shame.
3535,TORQUEMADA.,
3536,TORQUEMADA.,Then to the Grand Inquisitor once more
3537,TORQUEMADA.,"The Hidalgo went, more eager than before,"
3538,TORQUEMADA.,"And said: ""When Abraham offered up his son,"
