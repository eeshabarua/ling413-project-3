97,THE PILOT'S STORY.,
98,THE PILOT'S STORY.,
99,I.,I.
100,I.,
101,I.,"It was a story the pilot told, with his back to his hearers,--"
102,I.,Keeping his hand on the wheel and his eye on the globe of the
103,I.,"jack-staff,"
104,I.,"Holding the boat to the shore and out of the sweep of the current,"
105,I.,"Lightly turning aside for the heavy logs of the drift-wood,"
106,I.,Widely shunning the snags that made us sardonic obeisance.
107,I.,
108,II.,II.
109,II.,
110,II.,"All the soft, damp air was full of delicate perfume"
111,II.,"From the young willows in bloom on either bank of the river,--"
112,II.,"Faint, delicious fragrance, trancing the indolent senses"
113,II.,In a luxurious dream of the river and land of the lotus.
114,II.,Not yet out of the west the roses of sunset were withered;
115,II.,In the deep blue above light clouds of gold and of crimson
116,II.,Floated in slumber serene; and the restless river beneath them
117,II.,Rushed away to the sea with a vision of rest in its bosom;
118,II.,Far on the eastern shore lay dimly the swamps of the cypress;
119,II.,"Dimly before us the islands grew from the river's expanses,--"
120,II.,"Beautiful, wood-grown isles, with the gleam of the swart inundation"
121,II.,Seen through the swaying boughs and slender trunks of their
122,II.,willows;
123,II.,"And on the shore beside us the cotton-trees rose in the evening,"
124,II.,"Phantom-like, yearningly, wearily, with the inscrutable sadness"
125,II.,Of the mute races of trees. While hoarsely the steam from her
126,II.,'scape-pipes
127,II.,"Shouted, then whispered a moment, then shouted again to the"
128,II.,"silence,"
129,II.,Trembling through all her frame with the mighty pulse of her
130,II.,"engines,"
131,II.,"Slowly the boat ascended the swollen and broad Mississippi,"
132,II.,"Bank-full, sweeping on, with tangled masses of drift-wood,"
133,II.,"Daintily breathed about with whiffs of silvery vapor,"
134,II.,"Where in his arrowy flight the twittering swallow alighted,"
135,II.,And the belated blackbird paused on the way to its nestlings.
136,II.,
137,III.,III.
138,III.,
139,III.,"It was the pilot's story:--""They both came aboard there, at Cairo,"
140,III.,"From a New Orleans boat, and took passage with us for Saint Louis."
141,III.,"She was a beautiful woman, with just enough blood from her mother"
142,III.,Darkening her eyes and her hair to make her race known to a trader:
143,III.,You would have thought she was white. The man that was with
144,III.,"her,--you see such,--"
145,III.,"Weakly good-natured and kind, and weakly good-natured and vicious,"
146,III.,"Slender of body and soul, fit neither for loving nor hating."
147,III.,"I was a youngster then, and only learning the river,--"
148,III.,"Not over-fond of the wheel. I used to watch them at monte,"
149,III.,"Down in the cabin at night, and learned to know all of the"
150,III.,gamblers.
151,III.,"So when I saw this weak one staking his money against them,"
152,III.,"Betting upon the turn of the cards, I knew what was coming:"
153,III.,_They_ never left their pigeons a single feather to fly with.
154,III.,"Next day I saw them together,--the stranger and one of the"
155,III.,gamblers:
156,III.,"Picturesque rascal he was, with long black hair and moustaches,"
157,III.,Black slouch hat drawn down to his eyes from his villanous
158,III.,forehead.
159,III.,"On together they moved, still earnestly talking in whispers,"
160,III.,"On toward the forecastle, where sat the woman alone by the gangway."
161,III.,"Roused by the fall of feet, she turned, and, beholding her master,"
162,III.,Greeted him with a smile that was more like a wife's than
163,III.,"another's,"
164,III.,"Rose to meet him fondly, and then, with the dread apprehension"
165,III.,"Always haunting the slave, fell her eye on the face of the"
166,III.,"gambler,--"
167,III.,Dark and lustful and fierce and full of merciless cunning.
168,III.,Something was spoken so low that I could not hear what the words
169,III.,were;
170,III.,"Only the woman started, and looked from one to the other,"
171,III.,"With imploring eyes, bewildered hands, and a tremor"
172,III.,"All through her frame: I saw her from where I was standing, she"
173,III.,shook so.
174,III.,"'Say! is it so?' she cried. On the weak, white lips of her master"
175,III.,"Died a sickly smile, and he said, 'Louise, I have sold you.'"
176,III.,"God is my judge! May I never see such a look of despairing,"
177,III.,"Desolate anguish, as that which the woman cast on her master,"
178,III.,"Griping her breast with her little hands, as if he had stabbed her,"
179,III.,"Standing in silence a space, as fixed as the Indian woman"
180,III.,"Carved out of wood, on the pilot-house of the old Pocahontas!"
181,III.,"Then, with a gurgling moan, like the sound in the throat of the"
182,III.,"dying,"
183,III.,"Came back her voice, that, rising, fluttered, through wild"
184,III.,"incoherence,"
185,III.,Into a terrible shriek that stopped my heart while she answered:--
186,III.,'Sold me? sold me? sold--And you promised to give me my freedom!--
187,III.,"Promised me, for the sake of our little boy in Saint Louis!"
188,III.,"What will you say to our boy, when he cries for me there in Saint"
189,III.,Louis?
190,III.,"What will you say to our God?--Ah, you have been joking! I see"
191,III.,it!--
192,III.,"No? God! God! He shall hear it,--and all of the angels in heaven,--"
193,III.,Even the devils in hell!--and none will believe when they hear it!
194,III.,"Sold me!'--Her voice died away with a wail, and in silence"
195,III.,"Down she sank on the deck, and covered her face with her fingers."""
196,III.,
197,IV.,IV.
198,IV.,
199,IV.,"In his story a moment the pilot paused, while we listened"
200,IV.,"To the salute of a boat, that, rounding the point of an island,"
201,IV.,"Flamed toward us with fires that seemed to burn from the waters,--"
202,IV.,"Stately and vast and swift, and borne on the heart of the current."
203,IV.,"Then, with the mighty voice of a giant challenged to battle,"
204,IV.,"Rose the responsive whistle, and all the echoes of island,"
205,IV.,"Swamp-land, glade, and brake replied with a myriad clamor,"
206,IV.,Like wild birds that are suddenly startled from slumber at
207,IV.,"midnight,"
208,IV.,Then were at peace once more; and we heard the harsh cries of the
209,IV.,peacocks
210,IV.,"Perched on a tree by a cabin-door, where the white-headed settler's"
211,IV.,"White-headed children stood to look at the boat as it passed them,"
212,IV.,Passed them so near that we heard their happy talk and their
213,IV.,laughter.
214,IV.,"Softly the sunset had faded, and now on the eastern horizon"
215,IV.,"Hung, like a tear in the sky, the beautiful star of the evening."
216,IV.,
217,V.,V.
218,V.,
219,V.,"Still with his back to us standing, the pilot went on with his"
220,V.,story:--
221,V.,"""All of us flocked round the woman. The children cried, and their"
222,V.,mothers
223,V.,Hugged them tight to their breasts; but the gambler said to the
224,V.,"captain,--"
225,V.,'Put me off there at the town that lies round the bend of the
226,V.,river.
227,V.,"Here, you! rise at once, and be ready now to go with me.'"
228,V.,Roughly he seized the woman's arm and strove to uplift her.
229,V.,"She--she seemed not to heed him, but rose like one that is"
230,V.,"dreaming,"
231,V.,"Slid from his grasp, and fleetly mounted the steps of the gangway,"
232,V.,"Up to the hurricane-deck, in silence, without lamentation."
233,V.,"Straight to the stern of the boat, where the wheel was, she ran, and"
234,V.,the people
235,V.,"Followed her fast till she turned and stood at bay for a moment,"
236,V.,"Looking them in the face, and in the face of the gambler."
237,V.,"Not one to save her,--not one of all the compassionate people!"
238,V.,"Not one to save her, of all the pitying angels in heaven!"
239,V.,Not one bolt of God to strike him dead there before her!
240,V.,"Wildly she waved him back, we waiting in silence and horror."
241,V.,Over the swarthy face of the gambler a pallor of passion
242,V.,"Passed, like a gleam of lightning over the west in the night-time."
243,V.,"White, she stood, and mute, till he put forth his hand to secure"
244,V.,her;
245,V.,"Then she turned and leaped,--in mid-air fluttered a moment,--"
246,V.,"Down then, whirling, fell, like a broken-winged bird from a"
247,V.,"tree-top,"
248,V.,"Down on the cruel wheel, that caught her, and hurled her, and"
249,V.,"crushed her,"
250,V.,"And in the foaming water plunged her, and hid her forever."""
251,V.,
252,VI.,VI.
253,VI.,
254,VI.,"Still with his back to us all the pilot stood, but we heard him"
255,VI.,"Swallowing hard, as he pulled the bell-rope for stopping. Then,"
256,VI.,"turning,--"
257,VI.,"""This is the place where it happened,"" brokenly whispered the"
258,VI.,pilot.
259,VI.,"""Somehow, I never like to go by here alone in the night-time."""
260,VI.,Darkly the Mississippi flowed by the town that lay in the
261,VI.,"starlight,"
262,VI.,Cheerful with lamps. Below we could hear them reversing the
263,VI.,"engines,"
264,VI.,And the great boat glided up to the shore like a giant exhausted.
265,VI.,Heavily sighed her pipes. Broad over the swamps to the eastward
266,VI.,"Shone the full moon, and turned our far-trembling wake into silver."
267,VI.,"All was serene and calm, but the odorous breath of the willows"
268,VI.,Smote with a mystical sense of infinite sorrow upon us.

276,I.,I.
277,I.,
278,I.,"Red roses, in the slender vases burning,"
279,I.,"Breathed all upon the air,--"
280,I.,"The passion and the tenderness and yearning,"
281,I.,The waiting and the doubting and despair.
282,I.,
283,II.,II.
284,II.,
285,II.,"Still with the music of her voice was haunted,"
286,II.,"Through all its charméd rhymes,"
287,II.,The open book of such a one as chanted
288,II.,"The things he dreamed in old, old summer-times."
289,II.,
290,III.,III.
291,III.,
292,III.,The silvern chords of the piano trembled
293,III.,Still with the music wrung
294,III.,From them; the silence of the room dissembled
295,III.,The closes of the songs that she had sung.
296,III.,
297,IV.,IV.
298,IV.,
299,IV.,"The languor of the crimson shawl's abasement,--"
300,IV.,Lying without a stir
301,IV.,"Upon the floor,--the absence at the casement,"
302,IV.,The solitude and hush were full of her.
303,IV.,
304,V.,V.
305,V.,
306,V.,"Without, and going from the room, and never"
307,V.,"Departing, did depart"
308,V.,Her steps; and one that came too late forever
309,V.,Felt them go heavy o'er his broken heart.
310,V.,
311,VI.,VI.
312,VI.,
313,VI.,"And, sitting in the house's desolation,"
314,VI.,"He could not bear the gloom,"
315,VI.,The vanishing encounter and evasion
316,VI.,Of things that were and were not in the room.
317,VI.,
318,VII.,VII.
319,VII.,
320,VII.,Through midnight streets he followed fleeting visions
321,VII.,Of faces and of forms;
322,VII.,He heard old tendernesses and derisions
323,VII.,Amid the sobs and cries of midnight storms.
324,VII.,
325,VIII.,VIII.
326,VIII.,
327,VIII.,"By midnight lamps, and from the darkness under"

847,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"""Brethren and sisters in Jesus! the Lord hath heard our petitions,"
848,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,So that the hearts of his servants are awed and melted within

854,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Truly, but that it is well this day for me to be with you,"
855,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Now might I say to the Lord,--'I know thee, my God, in all fulness;"

858,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,
859,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,Faltered and ceased. And now the wild and jubilant music

861,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Surged in triumph, and fell, and ebbed again into silence."

870,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Quickening the dead among them, reviving the cold and the doubting."
871,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"There he charged them pray, and rest not from prayer while a sinner"
872,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,In the sound of their voices denied the Friend of the sinner:

879,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,Spake how their souls were moved with the might and the grace of the

881,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,Then while the converts recounted how God had chastened and saved
882,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"them,--"

895,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"High on platforms raised above the people, were kindled."
896,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Flaming aloof, as it were the pillar by night in the Desert"
897,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Fell their crimson light on the lifted orbs of the preachers,"
898,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Fell on the withered brows of the old men, and Israel's mothers,"
899,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Fell on the bloom of youth, and the earnest devotion of manhood,"
900,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,Fell on the anguish and hope in the tearful eyes of the mourners.
901,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Flaming aloof, it stirred the sleep of the luminous maples"

909,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"And by the Spirit of God, that was mightily striving within them,"
910,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Till at the last alone stood Louis Lebeau, unconverted."

912,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Louis Lebeau, the boatman, the trapper, the hunter, the fighter,"

918,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Quick of hand and of heart, impatient, generous, Western,"

920,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Not less the elders shook their heads and held him for outcast,"
921,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Reprobate, roving, ungodly, infidel, worse than a Papist,"

923,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Wild affrays and loves with the half-breeds out on the Osage,"
924,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Brawls at New Orleans, and all the towns on the rivers,"

928,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Daily she prayed for him, with conscious and tender effusion,"

950,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Dead in his eyes was the careless smile of old, and its phantom"
951,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Haunted his lips in a sneer of restless, incredulous mocking."
952,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Day by day he came to the outer skirts of the circle,"
953,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Dwelling on her, where she knelt by the white-haired exhorter, her"

961,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Ever he shook them off, not roughly, nor smiled at their transports."
962,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Then the preachers spoke and painted the terrors of Judgment,"
963,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"And of the bottomless pit, and the flames of hell everlasting."
964,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Still and dark he stood, and neither listened nor heeded;"

991,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"His who was gifted in speech, and the glow of the fires illumined"

1020,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Only his sense was filled with low, monotonous murmurs,"

1024,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Not with the rest was lifted her voice in the fervent responses,"

1030,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Of the days that shall bring me question of self and reproaches,"
1031,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"When the unrighteous shall mock, and my brethren and sisters shall"

1033,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Make me worthy to know thy will, my Savior, and do it!"""
1034,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"In her pain she prayed, and at last, through her mute adoration,"

1040,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Living and looking on us, but they cannot speak, and we cannot,--"
1041,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Knowing only the peril that threatened his soul's unrepentance,"
1042,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Knowing only the fear and error and wrong that withheld him,"
1043,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Thinking, ""In doubt of me, his soul had perished forever!"""
1044,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Touched with no feeble shame, but trusting her power to save him,"

1046,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"lover,"
1047,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Took his hand in her own, and mutely implored him an instant,"
1048,LOUIS LEBEAU'S CONVERSION.,"Answering, giving, forgiving, confessing, beseeching him all"

1213,I.,From year to year in the palace there:
1214,I.,But they watch and guard that no device

1216,I.,
1217,I.,"Their majesties the king and the queen,"
1218,I.,The parents of the reigning prince:
1219,I.,"Both put off royalty many years since,"
1220,I.,With life and the gifts that have always been
1221,I.,"Given to kings from God, to evince"
1222,I.,His sense of the mighty over the mean.
1223,I.,
1224,I.,I cannot say that I like the face
1225,I.,Of the king; it is something fat and red;
1226,I.,And the neck that lifts the royal head
1227,I.,Is thick and coarse; and a scanty grace
1228,I.,Dwells in the dull blue eyes that are laid
1229,I.,Sullenly on the queen in her place.
1230,I.,
1231,I.,He must have been a king in his day
1232,I.,'Twere well to pleasure in work and sport:
1233,I.,One of the heaven-anointed sort
1234,I.,"Who ruled his people with iron sway,"
1235,I.,"And knew that, through good and evil report,"
1236,I.,God meant him to rule and them to obey.
1237,I.,
1238,I.,There are many other likenesses
1239,I.,Of the king in his royal palace there;
1240,I.,"You find him depicted everywhere,--"
1241,I.,"In his robes of state, in his hunting-dress,"
1242,I.,"In his flowing wig, in his powdered hair,--"
1243,I.,"A king in all of them, none the less;"
1244,I.,
1245,I.,But most himself in this on the wall
1246,I.,"Over against his consort, whose"
1247,I.,"Laces, and hoops, and high-heeled shoes"
1248,I.,Make her the finest lady of all
1249,I.,"The queens or courtly dames you choose,"
1250,I.,In the ancestral portrait hall.
1251,I.,
1252,I.,A glorious blonde: a luxury
1253,I.,"Of luring blue and wanton gold,"
1254,I.,"Of blanchéd rose and crimson bold,"
1255,I.,Of lines that flow voluptuously
1256,I.,"In tender, languorous curves to fold"
1257,I.,Her form in perfect symmetry.
1258,I.,
1259,I.,She might have been false. Of her withered dust
1260,I.,There scarcely would be enough to write
1261,I.,Her guilt in now; and the dead have a right
1262,I.,To our lenient doubt if not to our trust:

1268,II.,"The queen died first, the queen died young,"
1269,II.,"But the king was very old when he died,"

1271,II.,And the usual Virtues came and hung
1272,II.,"Their cypress wreaths on his tomb, and wide"
1273,II.,Throughout his kingdom his praise was sung.
1274,II.,
1275,II.,"How the queen died is not certainly known,"
1276,II.,And faithful subjects are all forbid
1277,II.,To speak of the murder which some one did
1278,II.,One night while she slept in the dark alone:
1279,II.,"History keeps the story hid,"
1280,II.,And Fear only tells it in undertone.

1288,II.,
1289,II.,"Of that it knows. A door is fast,"
1290,II.,And none is suffered to enter there.
1291,II.,His sacred majesty could not bear
1292,II.,"To look at it toward the last,"
1293,II.,As he grew very old. It opened where
1294,II.,The queen died young so many years past.
1295,II.,
1296,III.,III.
1297,III.,
1298,III.,How the queen died is not certainly known;
1299,III.,But in the palace's solitude
1300,III.,"A harking dread and horror brood,"
1301,III.,"And a silence, as if a mortal groan"
1302,III.,"Had been hushed the moment before, and would"
1303,III.,Break forth again when you were gone.
1304,III.,
1305,III.,The present king has never dwelt
1306,III.,In the desolate palace. From year to year
1307,III.,In the wide and stately garden drear
1308,III.,The snows and the snowy blossoms melt
1309,III.,"Unheeded, and a ghastly fear"
1310,III.,Through all the shivering leaves is felt.
1311,III.,
1312,III.,By night the gathering shadows creep
1313,III.,"Along the dusk and hollow halls,"
1314,III.,And the slumber-broken palace calls
1315,III.,With stifled moans from its nightmare sleep;
1316,III.,And then the ghostly moonlight falls
1317,III.,Athwart the darkness brown and deep.
1318,III.,
1319,III.,"At early dawn the light wind sighs,"
1320,III.,And through the desert garden blows
1321,III.,The wasted sweetness of the rose;
1322,III.,At noon the feverish sunshine lies
1323,III.,"Sick in the walks. But at evening's close,"
1324,III.,"When the last, long rays to the windows rise,"
1325,III.,
1326,III.,"And with many a blood-red, wrathful streak"
1327,III.,Pierce through the twilight glooms that blur
1328,III.,His cruel vigilance and her
1329,III.,"Regard, they light fierce looks that wreak"
1330,III.,"A hopeless hate that cannot stir,"
1331,III.,A voiceless hate that cannot speak
1332,III.,
1333,III.,In the awful calm of the sleepless eyes;
1334,III.,And as if she saw her murderer glare
1335,III.,"On her face, and he the white despair"
1336,III.,"Of his victim kindle in wild surmise,"
1337,III.,"Confronted the conscious pictures stare,--"
1338,III.,And their secret back into darkness dies.

3456,XXI.,And of as goodly presence sooth was he
3457,XXI.,"As any little maiden might admire,"
3458,XXI.,Or any king-beholding cat might see
3459,XXI.,"""My poor Bopeep,"" he sigheth piteously,"
3460,XXI.,"""Rest here, and warm you at a hermit's fire."""
3461,XXI.,
3462,XXII.,XXII.
3463,XXII.,
3464,XXII.,"She looked so beautiful, there, mute and white,"
3465,XXII.,He kissed her on the lips and on the eyes
3466,XXII.,(The most a prince could do in such a plight);
3467,XXII.,"But chiefly gazed on her in still surprise,"
3468,XXII.,"And when he saw her lily eyelids rise,"
3469,XXII.,For him the whole world had no fairer sight.
3470,XXII.,
3471,XXIII.,XXIII.
3472,XXIII.,
3473,XXIII.,"""Rude is my fare: a bit of venison steak,"
3474,XXIII.,"A dish of honey and a glass of wine,"
3475,XXIII.,"With clean white bread, is the poor feast I make."
3476,XXIII.,"Be served, I pray: I think this flask is fine,"""
3477,XXIII.,"He said. ""Hard is this hermit life of mine:"
3478,XXIII.,"This day I will its weariness forsake."""
3479,XXIII.,
3480,XXIV.,XXIV.
3481,XXIV.,
3482,XXIV.,"And then he told her how it chanced that he,"
3483,XXIV.,"King Cole's son, in that forest held his court,"
3484,XXIV.,And the sole reason that there seemed to be
3485,XXIV.,"Was, he was being hermit there for sport;"
3486,XXIV.,"But he confessed the life was not his forte,"
3487,XXIV.,And therewith both laughed out right jollily.
3488,XXIV.,
3489,XXV.,XXV.
3490,XXV.,
3491,XXV.,And sly Bopeep forgot her sheep again
3492,XXV.,In gay discourse with that engaging youth:
3493,XXV.,Love hath such sovran remedies for pain!
3494,XXV.,"But then he was a handsome prince, in truth,"
3495,XXV.,"And both were young, and both were silly, sooth,"
3496,XXV.,And everything to Love but love seems vain.
3497,XXV.,
3498,XXVI.,XXVI.
3499,XXVI.,
3500,XXVI.,They took them down the silver-claspéd book
3501,XXVI.,"That this young anchorite's predecessor kept,--"
3502,XXVI.,"A holy seer,--and through it they did look;"
3503,XXVI.,"Sometimes their idle eyes together crept,"
3504,XXVI.,"Sometimes their lips; but still the leaves they swept,"
3505,XXVI.,Until they found a shepherd's pictured crook.
3506,XXVI.,
3507,XXVII.,XXVII.
3508,XXVII.,
3509,XXVII.,And underneath was writ it should befall
3510,XXVII.,"On such a day, in such a month and year,"
3511,XXVII.,"A maiden fair, a young prince brave and tall,"
3512,XXVII.,By such a chance should come together here.
3513,XXVII.,"They were the people, that was very clear:"
3514,XXVII.,"""O love,"" the prince said, ""let us read it all!"""
3515,XXVII.,
3516,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
3517,XXVIII.,
3518,XXVIII.,And thus the hermit's prophecy ran on:
3519,XXVIII.,"Though she her lost sheep wist not where to find,"
3520,XXVIII.,"Yet should she bid her weary care begone,"
3521,XXVIII.,And banish every doubt from her sweet mind:
3522,XXVIII.,"They, with their little snow-white tails behind,"
3523,XXVIII.,"Homeward would go, if they were left alone."
3524,XXVIII.,
3525,XXIX.,XXIX.
3526,XXIX.,
3527,XXIX.,"They closed the book, and in her happy eyes"
3528,XXIX.,"The prince read truth and love forevermore,--"
3529,XXIX.,Better than any hermit's prophecies!
3530,XXIX.,They passed together from the cavern's door;
3531,XXIX.,"Embraced, they turned to look at it once more,"
3532,XXIX.,"And over it beheld the glad sun rise,"
3533,XXIX.,
3534,XXX.,XXX.
3535,XXX.,
3536,XXX.,That streamed before them aisles of dusk and gold
3537,XXX.,"Under the song-swept arches of the wood,"
3538,XXX.,"And forth they went, tranced in each other's hold,"
3539,XXX.,"Down through that rare and luminous solitude,"
3540,XXX.,Their happy hearts enchanted in the mood
3541,XXX.,"Of morning, and of May, and romance old."
3542,XXX.,
3543,XXXI.,XXXI.
3544,XXXI.,
3545,XXXI.,"Sometimes the saucy leaves would kiss her cheeks,"
3546,XXXI.,And he must kiss their wanton kiss away;
3547,XXXI.,"To die beneath her feet the wood-flower seeks,"
3548,XXXI.,"The quivering aspen feels a fine dismay,"
3549,XXXI.,And many a scented blossom on the spray
3550,XXXI.,In odorous sighs its passionate longing speaks.
3551,XXXI.,
3552,XXXII.,XXXII.
3553,XXXII.,
3554,XXXII.,"And forth they went down to that stately stream,"
3555,XXXII.,Bowed over by the ghostly sycamores
3556,XXXII.,"(Awearily, as if some heavy dream"
3557,XXXII.,"Held them in languor), but whose opulent shores"
3558,XXXII.,With pearléd shells and dusts of precious ores
3559,XXXII.,Were tremulous brilliance in the morning beam;
3560,XXXII.,
3561,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
3562,XXXIII.,
3563,XXXIII.,"Where waited them, beside the lustrous sand,"
3564,XXXIII.,"A silk-winged shallop, sleeping on the flood;"
3565,XXXIII.,"And smoothly wafted from the hither strand,"
3566,XXXIII.,"Across the calm, broad stream they lightly rode,"
3567,XXXIII.,Under them still the silver fishes stood;
3568,XXXIII.,"The eager lilies, on the other land,"
3569,XXXIII.,
3570,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
3571,XXXIV.,
3572,XXXIV.,Beckonéd them; but where the castle shone
3573,XXXIV.,With diamonded turrets and a wall
3574,XXXIV.,"Of gold-embedded pearl and costly stone,"
3575,XXXIV.,Their vision to its peerless splendor thrall
3576,XXXIV.,"The maiden fair, the young prince brave and tall,"
3577,XXXIV.,"Thither with light, unlingering feet pressed on."
3578,XXXIV.,
3579,XXXV.,XXXV.
3580,XXXV.,
3581,XXXV.,"A gallant train to meet this loving pair,"
3582,XXXV.,"In silk and steel, moves from the castle door,"
3583,XXXV.,And up the broad and ringing castle stair
3584,XXXV.,"They go with gleeful minstrelsy before,"
3585,XXXV.,"And ""Hail our prince and princess evermore!"""
3586,XXXV.,From all the happy throng is greeting there.
3587,XXXV.,
3588,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
3589,XXXVI.,
3590,XXXVI.,"And in the hall the prince's sire, King Cole,"
3591,XXXVI.,"Sitting with crown and royal ermine on,"
3592,XXXVI.,"His fiddlers three behind with pipe and bowl,"
3593,XXXVI.,"Rises and moves to lift his kneeling son,"
3594,XXXVI.,"Greeting his bride with kisses many a one,"
3595,XXXVI.,And tears and laughter from his jolly soul;
3596,XXXVI.,
3597,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
3598,XXXVII.,
3599,XXXVII.,Then both his children to a window leads
3600,XXXVII.,"That over daisied pasture-land looks out,"
3601,XXXVII.,"And shows Bopeep where her lost flock wide feeds,"
3602,XXXVII.,And every frolic lambkin leaps about.
3603,XXXVII.,"She hears Boy-Blue, that lazy shepherd, shout,"
3604,XXXVII.,Slow pausing from his pipe of mellow reeds;
3605,XXXVII.,
3606,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
3607,XXXVIII.,
3608,XXXVIII.,"And, turning, peers into her prince's eyes;"
3609,XXXVIII.,"Then, caught and clasped against her prince's heart,"
3610,XXXVIII.,"Upon her breath her answer wordless dies,"
3611,XXXVIII.,"And leaves her gratitude to sweeter art,--"
3612,XXXVIII.,"To lips from which the bloom shall never part,"
3613,XXXVIII.,To looks wherein the summer never dies!

3625,I.,In a breathing of the blast.
3626,I.,
3627,I.,Cold through the clouds of sunset
3628,I.,"The thin red sunlight shone,"
3629,I.,Staining the gloom of the woodland
3630,I.,Where I walked and dreamed alone;
3631,I.,
3632,I.,And glinting with chilly splendor
3633,I.,"The meadow under the hill,"
3634,I.,Where the lingering larks were lurking
3635,I.,In the sere grass hid and still.
3636,I.,
3637,I.,"Out they burst with their singing,"
3638,I.,Their singing so loud and gay;
3639,I.,They made in the heart of October
3640,I.,"A sudden ghastly May,"
3641,I.,
3642,I.,That faded and ceased with their singing.
3643,I.,"The thin red sunlight paled,"
3644,I.,And through the boughs above me
3645,I.,The wind of evening wailed;--
3646,I.,
3647,I.,"Wailed, and the light of evening"
3648,I.,Out of the heaven died;

3663,II.,
3664,II.,"Falling, and falling, and falling,"

3738,A ROMANCE OF TRAVEL.,
3739,I.,I.
3740,I.,
3741,I.,"On your heart I feign myself fallen--ah, heavier burden,"
3742,I.,"Darling, of sorrow and pain than ever shall rest there! I take you"
3743,I.,"Into these friendless arms of mine, that you cannot escape me;"
3744,I.,"Closer and closer I fold you, and tell you all, and you listen"
3745,I.,"Just as you used at home, and you let my sobs and my silence"
3746,I.,"Speak, when the words will not come--and you understand and forgive"
3747,I.,me.
3748,I.,"--Ah! no, no! but I write, with the wretched bravado of distance,"
3749,I.,What you must read unmoved by the pity too far for entreaty.
3750,I.,
3751,II.,II.
3752,II.,
3753,II.,"Well, I could never have loved him, but when he sought me and"
3754,II.,"asked me,--"
3755,II.,"When to the men that offered their lives, the love of a woman"
3756,II.,"Seemed so little to give!--I promised the love that he asked me,"
3757,II.,"Sent him to war with my kiss on his lips, and thought him my hero."
3758,II.,"Afterward came the doubt, and out of long question, self-knowledge,--"
3759,II.,"Came that great defeat, and the heart of the nation was withered;"
3760,II.,Mine leaped high with the awful relief won of death. But the
3761,II.,"horror,"
3762,II.,"Then, of the crime that was wrought in that guilty moment of"
3763,II.,"rapture,--"
3764,II.,"Guilty as if my will had winged the bullet that struck him,--"
3765,II.,"Clung to me day and night, and dreaming I saw him forever,"
3766,II.,"Looking through battle-smoke with sorrowful eyes of upbraiding,"
3767,II.,"Or, in the moonlight lying gray, or dimly approaching,"
3768,II.,"Holding toward me his arms, that still held nearer and nearer,"
3769,II.,Folded about me at last ... and I would I had died in the fever!--
3770,II.,"Better then than now, and better than ever hereafter!"
3771,II.,
3772,III.,III.
3773,III.,
3774,III.,Weary as some illusion of fever to me was the ocean--
3775,III.,"Storm-swept, scourged with bitter rains, and wandering always"
3776,III.,"Onward from sky to sky with endless processions of surges,"
3777,III.,"Knowing not life nor death, but since the light was, the first day,"
3778,III.,"Only enduring unrest till the darkness possess it, the last day."
3779,III.,Over its desolate depths we voyaged away from all living:
3780,III.,All the world behind us waned into vaguest remoteness;
3781,III.,"Names, and faces, and scenes recurred like that broken remembrance"
3782,III.,"Of the anterior, bodiless life of the spirit,--the trouble"
3783,III.,"Of a bewildered brain, or the touch of the Hand that created,--"
3784,III.,"And when the ocean ceased at last like a faded illusion,"
3785,III.,Europe itself seemed only a vision of eld and of sadness.
3786,III.,"Naught but the dark in my soul remained to me constant and real,"
3787,III.,"Growing and taking the thoughts bereft of happier uses,"
3788,III.,Blotting all sense of lapse from the days that with swift iteration
3789,III.,Were and were not. They fable the bright days the fleetest:
3790,III.,"These that had nothing to give, that had nothing to bring or to"
3791,III.,"promise,"
3792,III.,Went as one day alone. For me was no alternation
3793,III.,"Save from my dull despair to wild and reckless rebellion,"
3794,III.,When the regret for my sin was turned to ruthless self-pity--
3795,III.,"When I hated him whose love had made me its victim,"
3796,III.,Through his faith and my falsehood yet claiming me. Then I was
3797,III.,smitten
3798,III.,"With so great remorse, such grief for him, and compassion,"
3799,III.,"That, if he could have come back to me, I had welcomed and loved"
3800,III.,him
3801,III.,"More than man ever was loved. Alas, for me that another"
3802,III.,"Holds his place in my heart evermore! Alas, that I listened"
3803,III.,"When the words, whose daring lured my spirit and lulled it,"
3804,III.,Seemed to take my blame away with my will of resistance!
3805,III.,
3806,III.,Do not make haste to condemn me: my will was the will of a
3807,III.,"woman,--"
3808,III.,Fain to be broken by love. Yet unto the last I endeavored
3809,III.,What I could to be faithful still to the past and my penance;
3810,III.,And as we stood that night in the old Roman garden together--
3811,III.,By the fountain whose passionate tears but now had implored me
3812,III.,"In his pleading voice--and he waited my answer, I told him"
3813,III.,"All that had been before of delusion and guilt, and conjured him"
3814,III.,Not to darken his fate with mine. The costly endeavor
3815,III.,"Only was subtler betrayal. O me, from the pang of confession,"
3816,III.,"Sprang what strange delight, as I tore from its lurking that"
3817,III.,horror--
3818,III.,Brooded upon so long--with the hope that at last I might see it
3819,III.,"Through his eyes, unblurred by the tears that disordered my vision!"
3820,III.,"Oh, with what rapturous triumph I humbled my spirit before him,"
3821,III.,"That he might lift me and soothe me, and make that dreary"
3822,III.,"remembrance,"
3823,III.,"All this confused present, seem only some sickness of fancy,"
3824,III.,"Only a morbid folly, no certain and actual trouble!"
3825,III.,If from that refuge I fled with words of too feeble denial--
3826,III.,"Bade him hate me, with sobs that entreated his tenderest pity,"
3827,III.,Moved mute lips and left the meaningless farewell unuttered--
3828,III.,"She that never has loved, alone can wholly condemn me."
3829,III.,
3830,IV.,IV.
3831,IV.,
3832,IV.,"How could he other than follow? My heart had bidden him follow,"
3833,IV.,"Nor had my lips forbidden; and Rome yet glimmered behind me,"
3834,IV.,When my soul yearned towards his from the sudden forlornness of
3835,IV.,absence.
3836,IV.,"Everywhere his face looked from vanishing glimpses of faces,"
3837,IV.,Everywhere his voice reached my senses in fugitive cadence.
3838,IV.,"Sick, through the storied cities, with wretched hopes, and"
3839,IV.,upbraidings
3840,IV.,"Of my own heart for its hopes, I went from wonder to wonder,"
3841,IV.,"Blind to them all, or only beholding them wronged, and related,"
3842,IV.,"Through some trick of wayward thought, to myself and my trouble."
3843,IV.,"Not surprise nor regret, but a fierce, precipitate gladness"
3844,IV.,Sent the blood to my throbbing heart when I found him in Venice.
3845,IV.,"""Waiting for you,"" he whispered; ""you would so."" I answered him"
3846,IV.,nothing.

3853,V.,Left us together alone in our world of love and of beauty.
3854,V.,"So, by noon and by night, we two have wandered in Venice,"
3855,V.,"Where the beautiful lives in vivid and constant caprices,"
3856,V.,"Yet, where the charm is so perfect that nothing fantastic surprises"
3857,V.,"More than in dreams, and one's life with the life of the city is"
3858,V.,blended
3859,V.,"In a luxurious calm, and the tumult without and beyond it"

3867,V.,"Narrow and secret canals, that dimly gleaming and glooming"
3868,V.,"Under palace-walls and numberless arches of bridges,"
3869,V.,List no sound but the dip of the gondolier's oar and his warning
3870,V.,"Cried from corner to corner; the sad, superb Canalazzo"
3871,V.,"Mirroring marvellous grandeur and beauty, and dreaming of glory"
3872,V.,Out of the empty homes of her lords departed; the footways
3873,V.,"Wandering sunless between the walls of the houses, and stealing"
3874,V.,"Glimpses, through rusted cancelli, of lurking greenness of gardens,"
3875,V.,Wild-grown flowers and broken statues and mouldering frescos;
3876,V.,"Thoroughfares filled with traffic, and throngs ever ebbing and"
3877,V.,flowing
3878,V.,"To and from the heart of the city, whose pride and devotion,"
3879,V.,"Lifting high the bells of St. Mark's like prayers unto heaven,"
3880,V.,Stretch a marble embrace of palaces toward the cathedral
3881,V.,"Orient, gorgeous, and flushed with color and light, like the"

3883,V.,"From the lingering waste that is not yet ruin in Venice,"
3884,V.,"And her phantasmal show, through all, of being and doing--"
3885,V.,"Came a strange joy to us, untouched by regret for the idle"
3886,V.,Days without yesterdays that died into nights without morrows.
3887,V.,"Here, in our paradise of love we reigned, new-created,"
3888,V.,"As in the youth of the world, in the days before evil and"

3890,V.,"Ah! in our fair, lost world was neither fearing nor doubting,"

3902,VI.,
3903,VI.,"Golden the sunset gleamed, above the city behind us,"
3904,VI.,"Out of a city of clouds as fairy and lovely as Venice,"
3905,VI.,While we looked at the fishing-tails of purple and yellow
3906,VI.,"Far on the rim of the sea, whose light and musical surges"
3907,VI.,"Broke along the sands with a faint, reiterant sadness."
3908,VI.,"But, when the sails had darkened into black wings, through the"
3909,VI.,twilight
3910,VI.,Sweeping away into night--past the broken tombs of the Hebrews
3911,VI.,"Homeward we sauntered slowly, through dew-sweet, blossomy alleys;"
3912,VI.,"So drew near the boat by errant and careless approaches,"
3913,VI.,"Entered, and left with indolent pulses the Lido behind us."
3914,VI.,
3915,VI.,"All the sunset had paled, and the campanili of Venice"
3916,VI.,Rose like the masts of a mighty fleet moored there in the water.
3917,VI.,Lights flashed furtively to and fro through the deepening twilight.
3918,VI.,Massed in one thick shade lay the Gardens; the numberless islands
3919,VI.,Lay like shadows upon the lagoons. And on us as we loitered
3920,VI.,"By their enchanted coasts, a spell of ineffable sweetness"
3921,VI.,Fell and made us at one with them; and silent and blissful
3922,VI.,"Shadows we seemed, that drifted on through a being of shadow,"
3923,VI.,"Vague, indistinct to ourselves, unbounded by hope or remembrance."
3924,VI.,"Yet we knew the beautiful night, as it grew from the evening:"
3925,VI.,Far beneath us and far above us the vault of the heavens
3926,VI.,"Glittered and darkened; and now the moon, that had haunted the"
3927,VI.,daylight
3928,VI.,"Thin and pallid, dimmed the stars with her fulness of splendor,"
3929,VI.,"And over all the lagoons fell the silvery rain of the moonbeams,"
3930,VI.,As in the song the young girls sang while their gondolas passed
3931,VI.,"us,--"
3932,VI.,"Sang in the joy of love, or youth's desire of loving."
3933,VI.,
3934,VI.,Balmy night of the South! O perfect night of the Summer!
3935,VI.,"Night of the distant dark, of the near and tender effulgence!--"
3936,VI.,How from my despair are thy peace and loveliness frightened!
3937,VI.,"For, while our boat lay there at the will of the light undulations,"
3938,VI.,"Idle as if our mood imbued and controlled it, yet ever"
3939,VI.,Seeming to bear us on athwart those shining expanses
3940,VI.,Out to shining seas beyond pursuit or returning--
3941,VI.,"There, while we lingered, and lingered, and would not break from our"
3942,VI.,"rapture,"
3943,VI.,Down the mirrored night another gondola drifted
3944,VI.,"Nearer and slowly nearer our own, and moonlighted faces"
3945,VI.,"Stared. And that sweet trance grew a rigid and dreadful possession,"
3946,VI.,"Which, if no dream indeed, yet mocked with such semblance of"
3947,VI.,"dreaming,"
3948,VI.,"That, as it happens in dreams, when a dear face, stooping to kiss"
3949,VI.,"us,"
3950,VI.,"Takes, ere the lips have touched, some malign and horrible aspect,"
3951,VI.,"_His_ face faded away, and the face of the Dead--of that other--"
3952,VI.,"Flashed on mine, and writhing, through every change of emotion,--"
3953,VI.,"Wild amaze and scorn, accusation and pitiless mocking,--"
3954,VI.,Vanished into the swoon whose blackness encompassed and hid me.

3957,VI.,
3958,VI.,"I am not sure, I own, that if first I had seen my delusion"
3959,VI.,"When I saw _you_, last night, I should be so ready to give you"
3960,VI.,"Now your promises back, and hold myself nothing above you,"
3961,VI.,That it is mine to offer a freedom you never could ask for.
3962,VI.,"Yet, believe me, indeed, from no bitter heart I release you:"
3963,VI.,"You are as free of me now as though I had died in the battle,"
3964,VI.,"Or as I never had lived. Nay, if it is mine to forgive you,"
3965,VI.,Go without share of the blame that could hardly be all upon your
3966,VI.,side.
3967,VI.,
3968,VI.,"Ghosts are not sensitive things; yet, after my death in the"
3969,VI.,"papers,"
3970,VI.,Sometimes a harrowing doubt assailed this impalpable essence:
3971,VI.,"Had I done so well to plead my cause at that moment,"
3972,VI.,When your consent must be yielded less to the lover than soldier?
3973,VI.,"""Not so well,"" I was answered by that ethereal conscience"
3974,VI.,"Ghosts have about them, ""and not so nobly or wisely as might be."""
3975,VI.,"--Truly, I loved you, then, as now I love you no longer."
3976,VI.,
3977,VI.,"I was a prisoner then, and this doubt in the languor of sickness"
3978,VI.,"Came; and it clung to my convalescence, and grew to the purpose,"
3979,VI.,"After my days of captivity ended, to seek you and solve it,"
3980,VI.,"And, if I haply had erred, to undo the wrong, and release you."
3981,VI.,
3982,VI.,"Well, you have solved me the doubt. I dare to trust that you wept"
3983,VI.,"me,"
3984,VI.,"Just a little, at first, when you heard of me dead in the battle?"
3985,VI.,"For we were plighted, you know, and even in this saintly humor,"
3986,VI.,I would scarce like to believe that my loss had merely relieved
3987,VI.,you.
3988,VI.,"Yet, I say, it was prudent and well not to wait for my coming"
3989,VI.,Back from the dead. If it may be I sometimes had cherished a fancy
3990,VI.,That I had won some right to the palm with the pang of the
3991,VI.,"martyr,--"
3992,VI.,"Fondly intended, perhaps, some splendor of self-abnegation,--"
3993,VI.,Doubtless all that was a folly which merciful chances have spared
3994,VI.,me.
3995,VI.,"No, I am far from complaining that Circumstance coolly has ordered"
3996,VI.,Matters of tragic fate in such a commonplace fashion.
3997,VI.,"How do I know, indeed, that the easiest isn't the best way?"

4005,I.,"Yes, I promised to write, but how shall I write to you, darling?"
4006,I.,"Venice we reached last Monday, wild for canals and for color,"
4007,I.,"Palaces, prisons, lagoons, and gondolas, bravoes, and moonlight,"
4008,I.,"All the mysterious, dreadful, beautiful things in existence."
4009,I.,"Fred had joined us at Naples, insuff'rably knowing and travelled,"
4010,I.,"Wise in the prices of things and great at tempestuous bargains,"
4011,I.,"Rich in the costly nothing our youthful travellers buy here,"
4012,I.,At a prodigious outlay of time and money and trouble;
4013,I.,"Utter confusion of facts, and talking the wildest of pictures,--"
4014,I.,"Pyramids, battle-fields, bills, and examinations of luggage,"
4015,I.,"Passports, policemen, porters, and how he got through his"
4016,I.,"tobacco,--"
4017,I.,"Ignorant, handsome, full-bearded, brown, and good-natured as ever:"
4018,I.,"Annie thinks him perfect, and I well enough for a brother."
4019,I.,"Also, a friend of Fred's came with us from Naples to Venice;"
4020,I.,"And, altogether, I think, we are rather agreeable people,"
4021,I.,For we've been taking our pleasure at all times in perfect
4022,I.,good-humor;
4023,I.,Which is an excellent thing that you'll understand when you've
4024,I.,"travelled,"
4025,I.,"Seen Recreation dead-beat and cross, and learnt what a burden"
4026,I.,"Frescos, for instance, can be, and, in general, what an affliction"
4027,I.,Life is apt to become among the antiques and old masters.
4028,I.,
4029,I.,"Venice we've thoroughly done, and it's perfectly true of the"
4030,I.,pictures--
4031,I.,"Titians and Tintorettos, and Palmas and Paul Veroneses;"
4032,I.,"Neither are gondolas fictions, but verities, hearse-like and"
4033,I.,"swan-like,"
4034,I.,"Quite as the heart could wish. And one finds, to one's infinite"
4035,I.,"comfort,"
4036,I.,Venice just as unique as one's fondest visions have made it:
4037,I.,"Palaces and mosquitoes rise from the water together,"
4038,I.,"And, in the city's streets, the salt-sea is ebbing and flowing"
4039,I.,Several inches or more.
4040,I.,
4041,I.,"--Ah! let me not wrong thee, O Venice!"
4042,I.,"Fairest, forlornest, and saddest of all the cities, and dearest!"
4043,I.,"Dear, for my heart has won here deep peace from cruel confusion;"
4044,I.,"And in this lucent air, whose night is but tenderer noon-day,"
4045,I.,"Fear is forever dead, and hope has put on the immortal!"
4046,I.,--There! and you need not laugh. I'm coming to something directly.
4047,I.,One thing: I've bought you a chain of the famous fabric of Venice--
4048,I.,"Something peculiar and quaint, and of such a delicate texture"
4049,I.,"That you must wear it embroidered upon a riband of velvet,"
4050,I.,If you would have the effect of its exquisite fineness and beauty.
4051,I.,"""Isn't it very frail?"" I asked of the workman who made it."
4052,I.,"""Strong enough, if you will, to bind a lover, signora,""--"
4053,I.,With an expensive smile. 'Twas bought near the Bridge of Rialto.
4054,I.,"(Shylock, you know.) In our shopping, Aunt May and Fred do the"
4055,I.,talking:
4056,I.,"Fred begins always in French, with the most delicious effront'ry,"
4057,I.,Only to end in profoundest humiliation and English.
4058,I.,"Aunt, however, scorns to speak any tongue but Italian:"
4059,I.,"""Quanto per these ones here?"" and ""What did you say was the"
4060,I.,"prezzo?"""
4061,I.,"""Ah! troppo caro! _Too much!_ No, no! Don't I _tell_ you it's"
4062,I.,"troppo?"""
4063,I.,All the while insists that the gondolieri shall show us
4064,I.,"What she calls Titian's palazzo, and pines for the house of"
4065,I.,Othello.
4066,I.,"Annie, the dear little goose, believes in Fred and her mother"
4067,I.,"With an enchanting abandon. She doesn't at all understand them,"
4068,I.,But she has some twilight views of their cleverness. Father is
4069,I.,"quiet,"
4070,I.,Now and then ventures some French when he fancies that nobody hears
4071,I.,"him,"
4072,I.,In an aside to the valet-de-place--I never detect him--
4073,I.,"Buys things for mother and me with a quite supernatural sweetness,"
4074,I.,"Tolerates all Fred's airs, and is indispensably pleasant."
4075,I.,
4076,II.,II.
4077,II.,
4078,II.,"Prattling on of these things, which I think cannot interest"
4079,II.,"deeply,"
4080,II.,So I hold back in my heart its dear and wonderful secret
4081,II.,"(Which I must tell you at last, however I falter to tell you),"
4082,II.,"Fain to keep it all my own for a little while longer,--"
4083,II.,Doubting but it shall lose some part of its strangeness and
4084,II.,"sweetness,"
4085,II.,"Shared with another, and fearful that even _you_ may not find it"
4086,II.,Just the marvel that I do--and thus turn our friendship to hatred.
4087,II.,
4088,II.,"Sometimes it seems to me that this love, which I feel is eternal,"
4089,II.,"Must have begun with my life, and that only an absence was ended"
4090,II.,When we met and knew in our souls that we loved one another.
4091,II.,"For from the first was no doubt. The earliest hints of the passion,"
4092,II.,"Whispered to girlhood's tremulous dream, may be mixed with"
4093,II.,"misgiving,"
4094,II.,"But, when the very love comes, it bears no vagueness of meaning;"
4095,II.,"Touched by its truth (too fine to be felt by the ignorant senses,"
4096,II.,"Knowing but looks and utterance) soul unto soul makes confession,"
4097,II.,"Silence to silence speaks. And I think that this subtile assurance,"
4098,II.,"Yet unconfirmed from without, is even sweeter and dearer"
4099,II.,Than the perfected bliss that comes when the words have been
4100,II.,spoken.
4101,II.,"--Not that I'd have them unsaid, now! But 't was delicious to"
4102,II.,ponder
4103,II.,"All the miracle over, and clasp it, and keep it, and hide it,--"
4104,II.,"While I beheld him, you know, with looks of indifferent languor,"
4105,II.,"Talking of other things, and felt the divine contradiction"
4106,II.,Trouble my heart below!
4107,II.,
4108,II.,"And yet, if no doubt touched our passion,"
4109,II.,"Do not believe for that, our love has been wholly unclouded."
4110,II.,All best things are ours when pain and patience have won them:
4111,II.,Peace itself would mean nothing but for the strife that preceded;
4112,II.,"Triumph of love is greatest, when peril of love has been sorest."
4113,II.,"(That's to say, I dare say. I'm only repeating what _he_ said.)"
4114,II.,"Well, then, of all wretched things in the world, a mystery, Clara,"
4115,II.,"Lurked in this life dear to mine, and hopelessly held us asunder"
4116,II.,"When we drew nearest together, and all but his speech said, ""I love"
4117,II.,"you."""
4118,II.,"Fred had known him at college, and then had found him at Naples,"
4119,II.,"After several years,--and called him a capital fellow."
4120,II.,"Thus far his knowledge went, and beyond this began to run shallow"
4121,II.,"Over troubled ways, and to break into brilliant conjecture,"
4122,II.,Harder by far to endure than the other's reticent absence--
4123,II.,Absence wherein at times he seemed to walk like one troubled
4124,II.,"By an uneasy dream, whose spell is not broken with waking,"
4125,II.,"But it returns all day with a vivid and sudden recurrence,"
4126,II.,"Like a remembered event. Of the past that was closest the present,"
4127,II.,"This we knew from himself: He went at the earliest summons,"
4128,II.,"When the Rebellion began, and falling, terribly wounded,"
4129,II.,"Into the enemy's hands, after ages of sickness and prison,"
4130,II.,"Made his escape at last; and, returning, found all his virtues"
4131,II.,"Grown out of recognition and shining in posthumous splendor,--"
4132,II.,"Found all changed and estranged, and, he fancied, more wonder than"
4133,II.,welcome.
4134,II.,"So, somewhat heavy of heart, and disabled for war, he had wandered"
4135,II.,"Hither to Europe for perfecter peace. Abruptly his silence,"
4136,II.,"Full of suggestion and sadness, made here a chasm between us;"
4137,II.,"But we spanned the chasm with conversational bridges,"
4138,II.,"Else talked all around it, and feigned an ignorance of it,"
4139,II.,"With that absurd pretence which is always so painful, or comic,"
4140,II.,Just as you happen to make it or see it.
4141,II.,
4142,II.,"In spite of our fictions,"
4143,II.,"Severed from his by that silence, my heart grew ever more anxious,"
4144,II.,Till last night when together we sat in Piazza San Marco
4145,II.,"(Then, when the morrow must bring us parting--forever, it might"
4146,II.,"be),"
4147,II.,Taking our ices al fresco. Some strolling minstrels were singing
4148,II.,"Airs from the Trovatore. I noted with painful observance,"
4149,II.,"With the unwilling minuteness at such times absolute torture,"
4150,II.,"All that brilliant scene, for which I cared nothing, before me:"
4151,II.,Dark-eyed Venetian leoni regarding the forestieri
4152,II.,With those compassionate looks of gentle and curious wonder
4153,II.,"Home-keeping Italy's nations bend on the voyaging races,--"
4154,II.,"Taciturn, indolent, sad, as their beautiful city itself is;"
4155,II.,Groups of remotest English--not just the traditional English
4156,II.,"(Lavish Milor is no more, and your travelling Briton is frugal)--"
4157,II.,"English, though, after all, with the Channel always between them,"
4158,II.,"Islanded in themselves, and the Continent's sociable races;"
4159,II.,"Country-people of ours--the New World's confident children,"
4160,II.,"Proud of America always, and even vain of the Troubles"
4161,II.,As of disaster laid out on a scale unequalled in Europe;
4162,II.,Polyglot Russians that spoke all languages better than natives;
4163,II.,"White-coated Austrian officers, anglicized Austrian dandies;"
4164,II.,"Gorgeous Levantine figures of Greek, and Turk, and Albanian--"
4165,II.,"These, and the throngs that moved through the long arcades and"
4166,II.,"Piazza,"
4167,II.,"Shone on by numberless lamps that flamed round the perfect Piazza,"
4168,II.,"Jewel-like set in the splendid frame of this beautiful picture,"
4169,II.,"Full of such motley life, and so altogether Venetian."
4170,II.,
4171,II.,Then we rose and walked where the lamps were blanched by the
4172,II.,moonlight
4173,II.,"Flooding the Piazzetta with splendor, and throwing in shadow"
4174,II.,"All the façade of Saint Mark's, with its pillars, and horses, and"
4175,II.,arches;
4176,II.,"But the sculptured frondage, that blossoms over the arches"
4177,II.,"Into the forms of saints, was touched with tenderest lucence,"
4178,II.,And the angel that stands on the crest of the vast campanile
4179,II.,Bathed his golden vans in the liquid light of the moonbeams.
4180,II.,Black rose the granite pillars that lift the Saint and the Lion;
4181,II.,Black sank the island campanili from distance to distance;
4182,II.,"Over the charmèd scene there brooded a presence of music,"
4183,II.,"Subtler than sound, and felt, unheard, in the depth of the spirit."
4184,II.,
4185,II.,How can I gather and show you the airy threads of enchantment
4186,II.,"Woven that night round my life and forever wrought into my being,"
4187,II.,As in our boat we glided away from the glittering city?
4188,II.,"Dull at heart I felt, and I looked at the lights in the water,"
4189,II.,"Blurring their brilliance with tears, while the tresses of eddying"
4190,II.,"seaweed,"
4191,II.,"Whirled in the ebbing tide, like the tresses of sea-maidens"
4192,II.,drifting
4193,II.,"Seaward from palace-haunts, in the moonshine glistened and"
4194,II.,darkened.
4195,II.,
4196,II.,"Sad and vague were my thoughts, and full of fear was the silence;"
4197,II.,"And, when he turned to speak at last, I trembled to hear him,"
4198,II.,"Feeling he now must speak of his love, and his life and its"
4199,II.,"secret,--"
4200,II.,"Now that the narrowing chances had left but that cruel conclusion,"
4201,II.,Else the life-long ache of a love and a trouble unuttered.
4202,II.,"Better, my feebleness pleaded, the dreariest doubt that had vexed"
4203,II.,"me,"
4204,II.,"Than my life left nothing, not even a doubt to console it;"
4205,II.,"But, while I trembled and listened, his broken words crumbled to"
4206,II.,"silence,"
4207,II.,"And, as though some touch of fate had thrilled him with warning,"
4208,II.,Suddenly from me he turned. Our gondola slipped from the shadow
4209,II.,"Under a ship lying near, and glided into the moonlight,"
4210,II.,"Where, in its brightest lustre, another gondola rested."
4211,II.,"_I_ saw two lovers there, and he, in the face of the woman,"
4212,II.,"Saw what has made him mine, my own belovèd, forever!"
4213,II.,"Mine!--but through _what_ tribulation, and awful confusion of"
4214,II.,spirit!
4215,II.,"Tears that I think of with smiles, and sighs I remember with"
4216,II.,"laughter,"
4217,II.,"Agonies full of absurdity, keen, ridiculous anguish,"
4218,II.,"Ending in depths of blissful shame, and heavenly transports!"
4219,II.,
4220,III.,III.
4221,III.,
4222,III.,"White, and estranged as a man who has looked on a spectre, he"
4223,III.,mutely
4224,III.,"Sank to the place at my side, nor while we returned to the city"
4225,III.,"Uttered a word of explaining, or comment, or comfort, but only,"
4226,III.,"With his good-night, incoherently craved my forgiveness and"
4227,III.,"patience,"
4228,III.,"Parted, and left me to spend the night in hysterical vigils,"
4229,III.,"Tending to Annie's supreme dismay, and postponing our journey"
4230,III.,"One day longer at least; for I went to bed in the morning,"
4231,III.,"Firmly rejecting the pity of friends, and the pleasures of travel,"
4232,III.,Fixed in a dreadful purpose never to get any better.
4233,III.,
4234,III.,"Later, however, I rallied, when Fred, with a maddening prologue"
4235,III.,"Touching the cause of my sickness, including his fever at Jaffa,"
4236,III.,Told me that some one was waiting; and could he see me a moment?
4237,III.,"See me? Certainly not. Or,--yes. But why did he want to?"
4238,III.,"So, in the dishabille of a morning-gown and an arm-chair,"
4239,III.,"Languid, with eloquent wanness of eye and of cheek, I received"
4240,III.,him--
4241,III.,"Willing to touch and reproach, and half-melted myself by my pathos,"
4242,III.,"Which, with a reprobate joy, I wholly forgot the next instant,"
4243,III.,"When, with electric words, few, swift, and vivid, he brought me,"
4244,III.,"Through a brief tempest of tears, to this heaven of sunshine and"
4245,III.,sweetness.
4246,III.,
4247,III.,"Yes, he had looked on a ghost--the phantom of love that was"
4248,III.,perished!--
4249,III.,"When, last night, he beheld the scene of which I have told you."
4250,III.,"For to the woman he saw there, his troth had been solemnly plighted"
4251,III.,Ere he went to the war. His return from the dead found her absent
4252,III.,"In the belief of his death; and hither to Europe he followed,--"
4253,III.,"Followed to seek her, and keep, if she would, the promise between"
4254,III.,"them,"
4255,III.,"Or, were a haunting doubt confirmed, to break it and free her."
4256,III.,"Then, at Naples we met, and the love that, before he was conscious,"
4257,III.,"Turned his life toward mine, laid torturing stress to the purpose"
4258,III.,"Whither it drove him forever, and whence forever it swerved him."
4259,III.,"How could he tell me his love, with this terrible burden upon him?"
4260,III.,"How could he linger near me, and still withhold the avowal?"
4261,III.,"And what ruin were that, if the other were doubted unjustly,"
4262,III.,"And should prove fatally true! With shame, he confessed he had"
4263,III.,"faltered,"
4264,III.,"Clinging to guilty delays, and to hopes that were bitter with"
4265,III.,"treason,"
4266,III.,Up to the eve of our parting. And then the last anguish was spared
4267,III.,him.
4268,III.,_Her_ love for him was dead. But the heart that leaped in his bosom
4269,III.,"With a great, dumb throb of joy and wonder and doubting,"
4270,III.,Still must yield to the spell of his silencing will till that
4271,III.,phantom
4272,III.,"Proved an actual ghost by common-place tests of the daylight,"
4273,III.,Such as speech with the lady's father.
4274,III.,
4275,III.,"And now, could I pardon--"
4276,III.,"Nay, did I think I could love him? I sobbingly answered, I thought"
4277,III.,so.
4278,III.,"And we are all of us going to Lago di Como to-morrow,"

4375,I.,Painted upon the ancient walls of the court of the Convent
4376,I.,"By a great master of old, who wore his sword and his dagger"

4382,II.,"Long ago the monks from their snug self-devotion were driven,"
4383,II.,"Wistful and fat and slow: looking backward, I fancied them going"
4384,II.,"Out through the sculptured doorway, and down the Ponte de'Frati,"
4385,II.,"Cowled and sandalled and beaded, a plump and pensive procession;"
4386,II.,"And in my day their cells were barracks for Austrian soldiers,"
4387,II.,Who in their turn have followed the Augustinian Friars.
4388,II.,"As to the frescos, little remained of work once so perfect."
4389,II.,Summer and winter weather of some three cycles had wasted;
4390,II.,"Plaster had fallen, and left unsightly blotches of ruin;"
4391,II.,Wanton and stupid neglect had done its worst to the pictures:
4392,II.,Yet to the sympathetic and reverent eye was apparent--
4393,II.,"Where the careless glance but found, in expanses of plaster,"
4394,II.,Touches of incoherent color and lines interrupted--
4395,II.,Somewhat still of the life of surpassing splendor and glory
4396,II.,"Filling the frescos once; and here and there was a figure,"
4397,II.,"Standing apart, and out from the common decay and confusion,"
4398,II.,"Flushed with immortal youth and ineffaceable beauty,"

4419,III.,"As I must fain believe (the lovely daughter of Palma,"

4427,III.,"Where they stood on guard beside one door of the Convent,"
4428,III.,Nor the sentinel beggars that watched the approach to the other;
4429,III.,"Neither the bigolanti, the broad-backed Friulan maidens,"
4430,III.,"Drawing the water with clatter and splashing, and laughter and"
4431,III.,"gossip,"
4432,III.,Out of the carven well in the midst of the court of the Convent--
4433,III.,"No, not even the one with the mole on her cheek and the sidelong"
4434,III.,"Look, as she ambled forth with her buckets of bronze at her"

4440,III.,"High on his scaffolding raised, Pordenone[5] wrought at his"
4441,III.,frescos.

4446,IV.,
4447,IV.,"It seemed to be summer,"
4448,IV.,In the forenoon of the day; and the master's diligent pencil
4449,IV.,"Laid its last light touches on Eve driven forth out of Eden,"
4450,IV.,"Otherwise Violante, and while his pupils about him"
4451,IV.,"Wrought and chattered, in silence ran the thought of the painter:"
4452,IV.,"""She, and forever she! Is it come to be my perdition?"
4453,IV.,"Shall I, then, never more make the face of a beautiful woman"
4454,IV.,"But it must take her divine, accursèd beauty upon it,"
4455,IV.,"And, when I finish my work, stand forth her visible presence?"
4456,IV.,Ah! I could take this sword and strike it into her bosom!
4457,IV.,Though I believe my own heart's blood would stream from the
4458,IV.,"painting,"
4459,IV.,"So much I love her! Yes, that look is marvellous like you,"
4460,IV.,"Wandering, tender--such as I'd give my salvation to win you"
4461,IV.,"Once to bend upon me! But I knew myself better than make you,"
4462,IV.,"Lest I should play the fool about you here before people,"
4463,IV.,"Helpless to turn away from your violet eyes, Violante,"
4464,IV.,"That have turned all my life to a vision of madness."" The painter"
4465,IV.,"Here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered,"
4466,IV.,"""Visions, visions, my son?"" said a gray old friar who listened,"
4467,IV.,"Seated there in the sun, with his eye on the work of the painter"
4468,IV.,"Fishily fixed, while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches."
4469,IV.,"""Much have I envied your Art, who vouchsafeth to those who adore"
4470,IV.,her
4471,IV.,Visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and vigils.
4472,IV.,"I have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion,"
4473,IV.,"Scourged myself almost to death, without one glimpse of the glory"
4474,IV.,Which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden.
4475,IV.,Pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions:
4476,IV.,"Fain would I know how they come to you, though _I_ never see them,"
4477,IV.,"And in my thickness of hearing I fear some words have escaped me."""
4478,IV.,"Then, while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar,"
4479,IV.,"Baleful, breathless, bewildered, fiercer than noon in the dog-days,"
4480,IV.,Round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur;
4481,IV.,From the lips to the ears of those nameless Beppis and Gigis
4482,IV.,"Buzzed the stinging whisper: ""Let's hear Pordenone's confession."""
4483,IV.,"Well they knew the master's luckless love, and whose portrait"
4484,IV.,"He had unconsciously painted there, and guessed that his visions"
4485,IV.,"Scarcely were those conceived by the friar, who constantly"
4486,IV.,blundered
4487,IV.,"Round the painter at work, mistaking every subject--"
4488,IV.,"Noah's drunken Debauch for the Stoning of Stephen the Martyr,"
4489,IV.,And the Conversion of Paul for the Flight into Egypt; forever
4490,IV.,"Putting his hand to his ear and shouting, ""Speak louder, I pray"
4491,IV.,"you!"""
4492,IV.,"So they waited now, in silent, amused expectation,"
4493,IV.,Till Pordenone's angry scorn should gather to bursting.
4494,IV.,"Long the painter gazed in furious silence, then slowly"
4495,IV.,"Uttered a kind of moan, and turned again to his labor."
4496,IV.,"Tears gathered into his eyes, of mortification and pathos,"
4497,IV.,"And when the dull old monk, who forgot, while he waited the answer,"
4498,IV.,"Visions and painter, and all, had maundered away in his error,"
4499,IV.,Pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom;
4500,IV.,"""For in my own,"" he mused, ""is such a combat of devils,"
4501,IV.,That I believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better
4502,IV.,Than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover
4503,IV.,"Heights which I never can reach, and bright on the pinnacle"
4504,IV.,standing
4505,IV.,"In the unfading light, my rival crowned victor above me."
4506,IV.,"If I could hint what I feel, what forever escapes from my pencil,"
4507,IV.,"All after-time should know my will was not less than my failure,"
4508,IV.,Nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity.
4509,IV.,"All should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage,"
4510,IV.,Saying: 'Not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored;
4511,IV.,His was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest
4512,IV.,"achievement,"
4513,IV.,"Conscious of doing his utmost, and knowing how vast his defeat is."
4514,IV.,"Life, if he would, might have had some second guerdon to give him,"
4515,IV.,But he would only the first; and behold! Let us honor
4516,IV.,Grief such as his must have been; no other sorrow can match it!
4517,IV.,There are certainly some things here that are nobly imagined:
4518,IV.,"Look! here is masterly power in this play of light, and these"
4519,IV.,shadows
4520,IV.,Boldly are massed; and what color! One can well understand
4521,IV.,Buonarotti
4522,IV.,Saying the sight of his Curtius was worth the whole journey from
4523,IV.,Florence.
4524,IV.,Here is a man at least never less than his work; you can feel it
4525,IV.,As you can feel in Titian's the painter's inferior spirit.
4526,IV.,"He and this Pordenone, you know, were rivals; and Titian"
4527,IV.,"Knew how to paint to the popular humor, and spared not"
4528,IV.,"Foul means or fair (his way with rivals) to crush Pordenone,"
4529,IV.,Who with an equal chance'--
4530,IV.,"""Alas, if the whole world should tell me"
4531,IV.,"I was his equal in art, and the lie could save me from torment,"
4532,IV.,"So must I be lost, for my soul could never believe it!"
4533,IV.,"Nay, let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory,"
4534,IV.,"Still, when I look on his work, my soul makes obeisance within me,"
4535,IV.,"Humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled."""
4536,IV.,
4537,IV.,"He who sleeps in continual noise is wakened by silence,"
4538,IV.,And Pordenone was roused from these thoughts anon by the sudden
4539,IV.,Hush that had fallen upon the garrulous group of his pupils;
4540,IV.,"And ere he turned half-way with instinctive looks of inquiry,"
4541,IV.,"He was already warned, with a shock at the heart, of a presence"
4542,IV.,"Long attended, not feared; and he laid one hand on his sword-hilt,"
4543,IV.,"Seizing the sheath with the other hand, that the pallet had dropped"
4544,IV.,from.
4545,IV.,"Then he fronted Titian, who stood with his arms lightly folded,"
4546,IV.,"And with a curious smile, half of sarcasm, half of compassion,"
4547,IV.,"Bent on th' embattled painter, cried: ""Your slave, Messere Antonio!"
4548,IV.,What good friend has played this bitter jest with your humor?
4549,IV.,"As I beheld you just now full-armed with your pencil and palette,"
4550,IV.,I was half awed by your might; but these sorry trappings of bravo
4551,IV.,"Make me believe you less fit to be the rival of Titian,"
4552,IV.,"Here in the peaceful calm of our well-ordered city of Venice,"
4553,IV.,"Than to take service under some Spanish lordling at Naples,"
4554,IV.,"Needy in blades for work that can not wait for the poison."""
4555,IV.,
4556,IV.,Pordenone flushed with anger and shame to be taken
4557,IV.,At an unguarded point; but he answered with scornful defiance:
4558,IV.,"""Oh, you are come, I see, with the favorite weapon of Titian,"
4559,IV.,"And you would make a battle of words. If you care for my counsel,"
4560,IV.,"Listen to me: I say you are skilfuller far in my absence,"
4561,IV.,And your tongue can inflict a keener and deadlier mischief
4562,IV.,"When it is dipped in poisonous lies, and wielded in secret."""
4563,IV.,"""Nay, then,"" Titian responded, ""methinks that our friend Aretino[6]"
4564,IV.,Makes a much better effect than either of us in that tongue-play.
4565,IV.,"But since Messer Robusti has measured our wit for his portrait,"
4566,IV.,Even _he_ has grown shyer of using his tongue than he once was.
4567,IV.,Have you not heard the tale? Tintoretto was told Aretino
4568,IV.,Meant to make him the subject of one of his merry effusions;
4569,IV.,"And with his naked dirk he went carefully over his person,"
4570,IV.,"Promising, if the poet made free with him in his verses,"
4571,IV.,He would immortalize my satirical friend with that pencil.
4572,IV.,Doubtless the tale is not true. Aretino says nothing about it;
4573,IV.,"Always speaks, in fact, with the highest respect of Robusti."
4574,IV.,"True or not, 'tis well found."" Then looking around on the frescos:"
4575,IV.,"""Good, very good indeed! Your breadth and richness and softness"
4576,IV.,No man living surpasses; those heads are truly majestic.
4577,IV.,"Yes, Buonarotti was right, when he said that to look at your"
4578,IV.,Curtius
4579,IV.,Richly repaid him the trouble and cost of a journey from Florence.
4580,IV.,Surely the world shall know you the first of painters in fresco!
4581,IV.,Well? You will not strike me unarmed? This was hardly expected
4582,IV.,By the good people that taught you to think our rivalry blood-red.
4583,IV.,"Let us be friends, Pordenone!"""
4584,IV.,"""Be patron and patronized, rather;"
4585,IV.,"Nay, if you spoke your whole mind out, be assassin and victim."
4586,IV.,"Could the life beat again in the broken heart of Giorgione,"
4587,IV.,"He might tell us, I think, something pleasant of friendship with"
4588,IV.,"Titian."""
4589,IV.,"Suddenly over the shoulder of Titian peered an ironical visage,"
4590,IV.,"Smiling, malignly intent--the leer of the scurrilous poet:"
4591,IV.,"""You know--all the world knows--who dug the grave of Giorgione.[7]"
4592,IV.,Titian and he were no friends--our Lady of Sorrows forgive 'em!
4593,IV.,"But for all hurt that Titian did him he might have been living,"
4594,IV.,"Greater than any living, and lord of renown and such glory"
4595,IV.,As would have left you both dull as yon withered moon in the
4596,IV.,"sunshine."""
4597,IV.,"Loud laughed the listening group at the insolent gibe of the poet,"
4598,IV.,"Stirring the gall to its depths in the bitter soul of their master,"
4599,IV.,"Who with his tremulous fingers tapped the hilt of his poniard,"
4600,IV.,"Answering naught as yet. Anon the glance of the ribald,"
4601,IV.,"Carelessly ranging from Pordenone's face to the picture,"
4602,IV.,"Dwelt with an absent light on its marvellous beauty, and kindled"
4603,IV.,"Into a slow recognition, with ""Ha! Violante!"" Then, erring"
4604,IV.,"Wilfully as to the subject, he cackled his filthy derision:"
4605,IV.,"""What have we here! More Magdalens yet of the painter's acquaintance?"
4606,IV.,"Ah--!"""
4607,IV.,"The words had scarce left his lips, when the painter"
4608,IV.,"Rushed upon him, and clutching his throat, thrust him backward and"
4609,IV.,held him
4610,IV.,"Over the scaffolding's edge in air, and straightway had flung him"
4611,IV.,"Crashing down on the pave of the cloister below, but for Titian,"
4612,IV.,Who around painter and poet alike wound his strong arms and stayed
4613,IV.,them
4614,IV.,"Solely, until the bewildered pupils could come to the rescue."
4615,IV.,"Then, as the foes relaxed that embrace of frenzy and murder--"
4616,IV.,"White, one with rage and the other with terror, and either with"
4617,IV.,hatred--
4618,IV.,"Grimly the great master smiled: ""You were much nearer paradise,"
4619,IV.,"Piero,"
4620,IV.,Than you have been for some time. Be ruled now by me and get
4621,IV.,homeward
4622,IV.,"Fast as you may, and be thankful."" And then, as the poet,"
4623,IV.,"Looking neither to right nor to left, amid the smiles of the pupils"
4624,IV.,"Tottered along the platform, and trembling descended the ladder"
4625,IV.,"Down to the cloister pave, and, still without upward or backward"
4626,IV.,"Glance, disappeared beneath the outer door of the Convent,"
4627,IV.,"Titian turned again to the painter: ""Farewell, Pordenone!"
4628,IV.,Learn more fairly to know me. I envy you not; and no rival
4629,IV.,"Now, or at any time, have I held you, or ever shall hold you."
4630,IV.,"Prosper and triumph still, for all me: you shall but do me honor,"
4631,IV.,Seeing that I too serve the art that your triumphs illustrate.
4632,IV.,I for my part find life too short for work and for pleasure;
4633,IV.,"If it should touch a century's bound, I should think it too"
4634,IV.,precious
4635,IV.,Even to spare a moment for rage at another's good fortune.
4636,IV.,Do not be fooled by the purblind flatterers who would persuade you
4637,IV.,Either of us shall have greater fame through the fall of the other.
4638,IV.,"We can thrive only in common. The tardily blossoming cycles,"
4639,IV.,"Flowering at last in this glorious age of our art, had not waited,"
4640,IV.,"Folded calyxes still, for Pordenone or Titian."
4641,IV.,"Think you if we had not been, our pictures had never been painted?"
4642,IV.,"Others had done them, or better, the same. We are only"
4643,IV.,Pencils God paints with. And think you that He had wanted for
4644,IV.,pencils
4645,IV.,But for our being at hand? And yet--for some virtue creative
4646,IV.,"Dwells and divinely exists in the being of every creature,"
4647,IV.,So that the thing done through him is dear as if he had done it--
4648,IV.,"If I should see your power, a tint of this great efflorescence,"
