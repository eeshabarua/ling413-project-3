232,SONGS YSAME,
233,SONGS YSAME,The Lighting of the Candles.
234,SONGS YSAME,
235,SONGS YSAME,
236,SONGS YSAME,WHENCE came the ember
237,SONGS YSAME,That touched our young souls' candles first with light;
238,SONGS YSAME,"In shadowy years, too distant to remember,"
239,SONGS YSAME,Where childhood merges backward into night?
240,SONGS YSAME,
241,SONGS YSAME,"I know not, but the halo of those tapers"
242,SONGS YSAME,Has ever since around all nature shone;
243,SONGS YSAME,And we have looked at life through golden vapors
244,SONGS YSAME,Because of that one ember touch alone.
245,SONGS YSAME,
246,SONGS YSAME,
247,SONGS YSAME,
248,SONGS YSAME,
249,SONGS YSAME,At Early Candle-Lighting.
250,SONGS YSAME,
251,SONGS YSAME,
252,SONGS YSAME,"THOSE, who have heard the whispered breath"
253,SONGS YSAME,"Of Nature's secret ""Shibboleth,"""
254,SONGS YSAME,And learned the pass-word to unroll
255,SONGS YSAME,"The veil that hides her inmost soul,"
256,SONGS YSAME,May follow; but this by-path leads
257,SONGS YSAME,Through mullein stalks and jimson-weeds.
258,SONGS YSAME,And he who scorning treads them down
259,SONGS YSAME,Would deem but poor and common-place
260,SONGS YSAME,Those whom he'll meet in homespun gown.
261,SONGS YSAME,But they who lovingly retrace
262,SONGS YSAME,"Their steps to scenes I dream about,"
263,SONGS YSAME,Will find the latch-string hanging out.
264,SONGS YSAME,"With them I claim companionship,"
265,SONGS YSAME,"And for them burn my tallow-dip,"
266,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
267,SONGS YSAME,
268,SONGS YSAME,"To these low hills, around which cling"
269,SONGS YSAME,"My fondest thoughts, I would not bring"
270,SONGS YSAME,An alien eye long used to sights
271,SONGS YSAME,Among the snow-crowned Alpine heights.
272,SONGS YSAME,An eagle does not bend its wing
273,SONGS YSAME,To low-built nests where robins sing.
274,SONGS YSAME,"Between the fence's zigzag rails,"
275,SONGS YSAME,The stranger sees the road that trails
276,SONGS YSAME,"Its winding way into the dark,"
277,SONGS YSAME,Fern-scented woods. He does not mark
278,SONGS YSAME,The old log cabin at the end
279,SONGS YSAME,"As I, or hail it as a friend,"
280,SONGS YSAME,"Or catch, when daylight's last rays wane,"
281,SONGS YSAME,The glimmer through its narrow pane
282,SONGS YSAME,Of early candle-lighting.
283,SONGS YSAME,
284,SONGS YSAME,As anglers sit and half in dream
285,SONGS YSAME,"Dip lazy lines into the stream,"
286,SONGS YSAME,"And watch the swimming life below,"
287,SONGS YSAME,So I watch pictures come and go.
288,SONGS YSAME,"And in the flame, Alladin-wise,"
289,SONGS YSAME,See genii of the past arise.
290,SONGS YSAME,If it be so that common things
291,SONGS YSAME,Can fledge your fancy with fast wings;
292,SONGS YSAME,If you the language can translate
293,SONGS YSAME,"Of lowly life, and make it great,"
294,SONGS YSAME,And can the beauty understand
295,SONGS YSAME,"That dignifies a toil-worn hand,"
296,SONGS YSAME,"Look in this halo, and see how"
297,SONGS YSAME,The homely seems transfigured now
298,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
299,SONGS YSAME,
300,SONGS YSAME,A fire-place where the great logs roar
301,SONGS YSAME,"And shine across the puncheon floor,"
302,SONGS YSAME,"And through the chinked walls, here and there,"
303,SONGS YSAME,"The snow steals, and the frosty air."
304,SONGS YSAME,"Meager and bare the furnishings,"
305,SONGS YSAME,But hospitality that kings
306,SONGS YSAME,"Might well dispense, transmutes to gold,"
307,SONGS YSAME,The welcome given young and old.
308,SONGS YSAME,"Plain and uncouth in speech and dress,"
309,SONGS YSAME,"But richly clad in kindliness,"
310,SONGS YSAME,"The neighbors gather, one by one,"
311,SONGS YSAME,At rustic rout when day is done.
312,SONGS YSAME,"Vanish all else in this soft light,--"
313,SONGS YSAME,The past is ours again tonight;
314,SONGS YSAME,'Tis early candle-lighting.
315,SONGS YSAME,
316,SONGS YSAME,"Oh, well-remembered scenes like these:"
317,SONGS YSAME,"The candy-pullings, husking-bees--"
318,SONGS YSAME,The evenings when the quilting frames
319,SONGS YSAME,Were laid aside for romping games;
320,SONGS YSAME,The singing school! The spelling match!
321,SONGS YSAME,"My hand still lingers on the latch,"
322,SONGS YSAME,I fain would wider swing the door
323,SONGS YSAME,And enter with the guests once more.
324,SONGS YSAME,Though into ashes long ago
325,SONGS YSAME,"That fire faded, still the glow"
326,SONGS YSAME,"That warmed the hearts around it met,"
327,SONGS YSAME,"Immortal, burns within me yet."
328,SONGS YSAME,Still to that cabin in the wood
329,SONGS YSAME,I turn for highest types of good
330,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
331,SONGS YSAME,
332,SONGS YSAME,How fast the scenes come flocking to
333,SONGS YSAME,"My mind, as white sheep jostle through"
334,SONGS YSAME,"The gap, when pasture bars are down,"
335,SONGS YSAME,And pass into the twilight brown.
336,SONGS YSAME,"Grandmother's face and snowy cap,"
337,SONGS YSAME,"The knitting work upon her lap,"
338,SONGS YSAME,"The creaking, high-backed rocking-chair;"
339,SONGS YSAME,"The spinning-wheel, the big loom where"
340,SONGS YSAME,The shuttle carried song and thread;
341,SONGS YSAME,"The valance on the high, white bed"
342,SONGS YSAME,Whose folds the lavender still keep.
343,SONGS YSAME,Oh! nowhere else such dreamless sleep
344,SONGS YSAME,"On tired eyes its deep spell lays,"
345,SONGS YSAME,As that which came in those old days
346,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
347,SONGS YSAME,
348,SONGS YSAME,"A kitchen lit by one dim light,"
349,SONGS YSAME,"And 'round the table in affright,"
350,SONGS YSAME,A group of children telling tales.
351,SONGS YSAME,"Outside, the wind--a banshee--wails."
352,SONGS YSAME,"Even the shadows, that they throw"
353,SONGS YSAME,"Upon the walls, to giants grow."
354,SONGS YSAME,The hailstones 'gainst the window panes
355,SONGS YSAME,"Fall with the noise of clanking chains,"
356,SONGS YSAME,"Till, glancing back, they almost feel"
357,SONGS YSAME,"Black shapes from out the corners steal,"
358,SONGS YSAME,"And, climbing to the loft o'erhead,"
359,SONGS YSAME,The witches follow them to bed.
360,SONGS YSAME,The low flame flickers. Snuff the wick!
361,SONGS YSAME,For ghosts and goblins crowd so thick
362,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
363,SONGS YSAME,
364,SONGS YSAME,An orchard path that tramping feet
365,SONGS YSAME,For half a century have beat;
366,SONGS YSAME,Here to the fields at sun-up went
367,SONGS YSAME,"The reapers. Here, on errands sent,"
368,SONGS YSAME,"Small bare-feet loitered, loath to go."
369,SONGS YSAME,"Here apple-boughs dropped blooming snow,"
370,SONGS YSAME,Through garden borders gaily set
371,SONGS YSAME,With touch-me-nots and bouncing Bet;
372,SONGS YSAME,Here passed at dusk the harvester
373,SONGS YSAME,With quickened step and pulse astir
374,SONGS YSAME,"At sight of some one's fluttering gown,"
375,SONGS YSAME,Who stood with sunbonnet pulled down
376,SONGS YSAME,"And called the cows. Ah, in a glance"
377,SONGS YSAME,"One reads that simple, old romance"
378,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
379,SONGS YSAME,
380,SONGS YSAME,One picture more. A winter day
381,SONGS YSAME,"Just done, and supper cleared away."
382,SONGS YSAME,"The romping children quiet grow,"
383,SONGS YSAME,"And in the reverent silence, slow"
384,SONGS YSAME,"The old man turns the sacred page,"
385,SONGS YSAME,Guide of his life and staff of age.
386,SONGS YSAME,"And then, the while my eyes grow dim,"
387,SONGS YSAME,The mother's voice begins a hymn:
388,SONGS YSAME,"""_Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of prayer"
389,SONGS YSAME,"That calls me from a world of care!_"""
390,SONGS YSAME,What wonder from those cabins rude
391,SONGS YSAME,"Came lives of stalwart rectitude,"
392,SONGS YSAME,When hearth-stones were the altars where
393,SONGS YSAME,Arose the vestal flame of prayer
394,SONGS YSAME,At early candle-lighting.
395,SONGS YSAME,
396,SONGS YSAME,"No crumbling castle walls are ours,"
397,SONGS YSAME,No ruined battlements and towers.
398,SONGS YSAME,"Our history, on callow wings,"
399,SONGS YSAME,Soared not in time of feudal kings;
400,SONGS YSAME,No strolling minstrel's roundelay
401,SONGS YSAME,"Tells of past glory in decay,"
402,SONGS YSAME,But rugged life of pioneer
403,SONGS YSAME,Has passed away among us here;
404,SONGS YSAME,And as the ivy tendrils grow
405,SONGS YSAME,"About the ancient turrets, so"
406,SONGS YSAME,The influence of its sturdy truth
407,SONGS YSAME,"Shall live in never-ending youth,"
408,SONGS YSAME,When simple customs of its day
409,SONGS YSAME,"Have, long-forgotten, passed away"
410,SONGS YSAME,With early candle-lighting.
411,SONGS YSAME,
412,SONGS YSAME,
413,SONGS YSAME,
414,SONGS YSAME,
415,SONGS YSAME,Bob White.
416,SONGS YSAME,
417,SONGS YSAME,
418,SONGS YSAME,"JUST now, beyond the turmoil and the din"
419,SONGS YSAME,"Of crowded streets that city walls shut in,"
420,SONGS YSAME,I heard the whistle of a quail begin:
421,SONGS YSAME,"""Bob White! Bob White!"""
422,SONGS YSAME,So faintly and far away falling
423,SONGS YSAME,It seemed that a dream voice was calling
424,SONGS YSAME,"""Bob White! Bob White!"""
425,SONGS YSAME,How the old sights and sounds come thronging
426,SONGS YSAME,And thrill me with a sudden longing!
427,SONGS YSAME,
428,SONGS YSAME,Through quiet country lanes the sunset shines.
429,SONGS YSAME,"Fence corners where the wild rose climbs and twines,"
430,SONGS YSAME,"And blooms in tangled black-berry vines,"
431,SONGS YSAME,"""Bob White! Bob White!"""
432,SONGS YSAME,"I envy yon home-going swallow,"
433,SONGS YSAME,"Oh, but swiftly to rise and follow--"
434,SONGS YSAME,"Follow its flight,"
435,SONGS YSAME,"Follow it back with happy flying,"
436,SONGS YSAME,Where green-clad hills are calmly lying.
437,SONGS YSAME,
438,SONGS YSAME,Wheat fields whose golden silences are stirred
439,SONGS YSAME,"By whirring insect wings, and naught is heard"
440,SONGS YSAME,"But plaintive callings of that one sweet word,"
441,SONGS YSAME,"""Bob White! Bob White!"""
442,SONGS YSAME,And a smell of the clover growing
443,SONGS YSAME,"In the meadow lands ripe for mowing,"
444,SONGS YSAME,All red and white.
445,SONGS YSAME,"Over the shady creek comes sailing,"
446,SONGS YSAME,Past willows in the water trailing.
447,SONGS YSAME,
448,SONGS YSAME,"Tired heart, 'tis but in dreams I turn my feet,"
449,SONGS YSAME,Again to wander in the ripening wheat
450,SONGS YSAME,And hear the whistle of the quail repeat
451,SONGS YSAME,"""Bob White! Bob White!"""
452,SONGS YSAME,But oh! there is joy in the knowing
453,SONGS YSAME,"That somewhere green pastures are growing,"
454,SONGS YSAME,Though out of sight.
455,SONGS YSAME,"And the light on those church spires dying,"
456,SONGS YSAME,On the old home meadow is lying.
457,SONGS YSAME,
458,SONGS YSAME,
459,SONGS YSAME,
460,SONGS YSAME,
461,SONGS YSAME,Grandfather.
462,SONGS YSAME,
463,SONGS YSAME,
464,SONGS YSAME,"HOW broad and deep was the fireplace old,"
465,SONGS YSAME,And the great hearth-stone how wide!
466,SONGS YSAME,There was always room for the old man's chair
467,SONGS YSAME,"By the cosy chimney side,"
468,SONGS YSAME,And all the children that cared to crowd
469,SONGS YSAME,At his knee in the evening-tide.
470,SONGS YSAME,
471,SONGS YSAME,Room for all of the homeless ones
472,SONGS YSAME,Who had nowhere else to go;
473,SONGS YSAME,They might bask at ease in the grateful warmth
474,SONGS YSAME,"And sun in the cheerful glow,"
475,SONGS YSAME,For Grandfather's heart was as wide and warm
476,SONGS YSAME,"As the old fireplace, I know."
477,SONGS YSAME,
478,SONGS YSAME,And he always found at his well-spread board
479,SONGS YSAME,Just room for another chair;
480,SONGS YSAME,There was always rest for another head
481,SONGS YSAME,On the pillow of his care;
482,SONGS YSAME,There was always place for another name
483,SONGS YSAME,In his trustful morning prayer.
484,SONGS YSAME,
485,SONGS YSAME,"Oh, crowded world with your jostling throngs!"
486,SONGS YSAME,"How narrow you grow, and small;"
487,SONGS YSAME,"How cold, like a shadow across the heart,"
488,SONGS YSAME,"Your selfishness seems to fall,"
489,SONGS YSAME,"When I think of that fireplace warm and wide,"
490,SONGS YSAME,And the welcome awaiting all.
491,SONGS YSAME,
492,SONGS YSAME,
493,SONGS YSAME,
494,SONGS YSAME,
495,SONGS YSAME,The Old Church.
496,SONGS YSAME,
497,SONGS YSAME,
498,SONGS YSAME,"CLOSE to the road it stood among the trees,"
499,SONGS YSAME,"The old, bare church, with windows small and high,"
500,SONGS YSAME,"And open doors that gave, on meeting day,"
501,SONGS YSAME,A welcome to the careless passer by.
502,SONGS YSAME,
503,SONGS YSAME,"Its straight, uncushioned seats, how hard they seemed!"
504,SONGS YSAME,What penance-doing form they always wore
505,SONGS YSAME,"To little heads that could not reach the text,"
506,SONGS YSAME,And little feet that could not reach the floor.
507,SONGS YSAME,
508,SONGS YSAME,What wonder that we hailed with strong delight
509,SONGS YSAME,"The buzzing wasp, slow sailing down the aisle,"
510,SONGS YSAME,"Or, sunk in sin, beguiled the constant fly"
511,SONGS YSAME,"From weary heads, to make our neighbors smile."
512,SONGS YSAME,
513,SONGS YSAME,How softly from the churchyard came the breeze
514,SONGS YSAME,"That stirred the cedar boughs with scented wings,"
515,SONGS YSAME,And gently fanned the sleeper's heated brow
516,SONGS YSAME,Or fluttered Grandma Barlow's bonnet strings.
517,SONGS YSAME,
518,SONGS YSAME,"With half-shut eyes, across the pulpit bent,"
519,SONGS YSAME,The preacher droned in soothing tones about
520,SONGS YSAME,"Some theme, that like the narrow windows high,"
521,SONGS YSAME,"Took in the sky, but left terrestrials out."
522,SONGS YSAME,
523,SONGS YSAME,"Good, worthy man, his work on earth is done;"
524,SONGS YSAME,"His place is lost, the old church passed away;"
525,SONGS YSAME,"And with them, when they went, there must have gone"
526,SONGS YSAME,"That sweet, bright calm, my childhood's Sabbath day."
527,SONGS YSAME,
528,SONGS YSAME,
529,SONGS YSAME,
530,SONGS YSAME,
531,SONGS YSAME,An Old-Time Pedagogue.
532,SONGS YSAME,
533,SONGS YSAME,
534,SONGS YSAME,SLOWLY adown the village street
535,SONGS YSAME,"With groping cane and faltering feet,"
536,SONGS YSAME,He goes each day through cold or heat--
537,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
538,SONGS YSAME,"His hair is scant upon his head,"
539,SONGS YSAME,"His eyes are dim, his nose is red,"
540,SONGS YSAME,"And yet, his mien is stern and dread--"
541,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
542,SONGS YSAME,
543,SONGS YSAME,The village lads his form descry
544,SONGS YSAME,"While yet afar, and boldly cry--"
545,SONGS YSAME,(For bears are scarce and rods are high)
546,SONGS YSAME,"""Old Daddy Hight!"""
547,SONGS YSAME,"But when their fathers meet his glance,"
548,SONGS YSAME,They nod and smile and look askance.
549,SONGS YSAME,He taught them once the Modoc dance--
550,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
551,SONGS YSAME,
552,SONGS YSAME,"How long we cling to servitude,"
553,SONGS YSAME,How long we keep the schoolboy's mood!
554,SONGS YSAME,Still seems with awful power endued--
555,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
556,SONGS YSAME,"They feel a cringing of the knee,"
557,SONGS YSAME,"Those fathers, yet, whene'er they see"
558,SONGS YSAME,Adown the walk pace solemnly--
559,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
560,SONGS YSAME,
561,SONGS YSAME,"Wide is his fame, of how he taught,"
562,SONGS YSAME,"And how he flogged, and reckoned naught"
563,SONGS YSAME,The toils and pains that knowledge bought--
564,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
565,SONGS YSAME,"He had no lack of ""ways and means"""
566,SONGS YSAME,To track the loiterers on the greens;
567,SONGS YSAME,He scorned all counterfeits and screens--
568,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
569,SONGS YSAME,
570,SONGS YSAME,"Oh, dire the day that brewed mishap!"
571,SONGS YSAME,"That brought to luckless back his strap,"
572,SONGS YSAME,To hanging head his Dunce's cap--
573,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
574,SONGS YSAME,No blotted page dared meet his eye;
575,SONGS YSAME,"The owner quaked and wished to die,"
576,SONGS YSAME,"When rod in hand, with wrath strode by--"
577,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
578,SONGS YSAME,
579,SONGS YSAME,He helped them up the thorny steep
580,SONGS YSAME,"Of wisdom's path with pain to creep,"
581,SONGS YSAME,With vigilance that might not sleep--
582,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
583,SONGS YSAME,"Now, down his life's long, slow decline,"
584,SONGS YSAME,He walks alone at eighty-nine--
585,SONGS YSAME,The last of his illustrious line--
586,SONGS YSAME,Old Daddy Hight.
587,SONGS YSAME,
588,SONGS YSAME,
589,SONGS YSAME,
590,SONGS YSAME,
591,SONGS YSAME,Her Title-Deeds.
592,SONGS YSAME,
593,SONGS YSAME,
594,SONGS YSAME,"INSIDE the cottage door she sits,"
595,SONGS YSAME,"Just where the sunlight, softest there,"
596,SONGS YSAME,"Slants down on snowy kerchief's bands,"
597,SONGS YSAME,On folded hands and silvered hair.
598,SONGS YSAME,
599,SONGS YSAME,"The garden pale her world shuts in,"
600,SONGS YSAME,"A simple world made sweet with thyme,"
601,SONGS YSAME,"Where life, soft lulled by droning bees,"
602,SONGS YSAME,Flows to the mill-stream's lapsing rhyme.
603,SONGS YSAME,
604,SONGS YSAME,"Poor are her cottage walls, and bare;"
605,SONGS YSAME,"Too mean and small to harbor pride,"
606,SONGS YSAME,Yet with a musing gaze she sees
607,SONGS YSAME,Her broad domains extending wide.
608,SONGS YSAME,
609,SONGS YSAME,"Green slopes of hills, and waving fields,"
610,SONGS YSAME,"With blooming hedges set between,"
611,SONGS YSAME,"Through shifting veils of tender mist,"
612,SONGS YSAME,"Smile, half revealed, a mingled scene."
613,SONGS YSAME,
614,SONGS YSAME,"All hers, for lovingly she holds"
615,SONGS YSAME,"A yellow packet in her hand,"
616,SONGS YSAME,"Whose ancient, faded script proclaims"
617,SONGS YSAME,Her title to this spreading land.
618,SONGS YSAME,
619,SONGS YSAME,Old letters! On the trembling page
620,SONGS YSAME,"Drop unawares, unheeded tears."
621,SONGS YSAME,"These are her title-deeds, her lands"
622,SONGS YSAME,Spread through the realms of by-gone years.

658,INTERLUDES.,I heed its sound no more;

671,INTERLUDES.,"The old, remembered music to awake;"

673,INTERLUDES.,There are some silent keys.
674,INTERLUDES.,
675,INTERLUDES.,"So is it when I call to those I loved,"
676,INTERLUDES.,Who blessed my life with tender care and fond:
677,INTERLUDES.,"So is it with those early dreams and hopes,"
678,INTERLUDES.,"Some voices answer and some notes respond,"
679,INTERLUDES.,"But in the chords that I would strike, like these,"
680,INTERLUDES.,There are some silent keys.
681,INTERLUDES.,
682,INTERLUDES.,"Heart, dost thou hear not in those pauses fall"
683,INTERLUDES.,"A still, small voice that speaks to thee of peace?"
684,INTERLUDES.,"What though some hopes may fail, some dreams be lost,"

772,PART II.,
773,PART II.,And sometimes down its slopes a wind will come

809,PART II.,
810,PART II.,"By some strange miracle, maybe divine,"
811,PART II.,The sunlight falls upon the buried past
812,PART II.,"And turns its water into sparkling wine,"

814,PART II.,Could it have been those long-lost halcyon days
815,PART II.,Trailed not a cloud across our April sky?
816,PART II.,Faltered we not along those untried ways?

818,PART II.,"Ah, yes! But unreturning feet forget"
819,PART II.,"Rough places trodden in the long ago,"

824,PART II.,
825,PART II.,"The little white, wind-blown anemone"
826,PART II.,"By one round dewdrop may be fully filled,"
827,PART II.,"And by some light-winged, passing honey-bee"
828,PART II.,Its cup of crystal water may be spilled.
829,PART II.,So does the child heart hold its happiness:
830,PART II.,A drop will fill it to its rosy rim.
831,PART II.,"It is not that these later days bring less,"
832,PART II.,That joy so rarely rises to the brim;
833,PART II.,It is because the heart has deeper grown.
834,PART II.,A fuller knowledge must its thirst assuage.
835,PART II.,Perhaps we would not deem those pleasures flown
836,PART II.,"As bright as those which star the present age,"

847,PART II.,The problems that we could not understand.
848,PART II.,"Washed of its stain, bereft of any sting,"
849,PART II.,"Seen through the window of the Memory,"
850,PART II.,"Perchance, a gentler grace to it may cling"
851,PART II.,Than we may now think possible to see.
852,PART II.,"For skies will gleam, though gray with rain,"
853,PART II.,Like sunshine through that amber pane.
854,PART II.,
855,PART II.,"We may not stand on Patmos, and look through"

857,PART II.,"No brush that unveiled beauty ever drew,"

859,PART II.,"So lest we falter, faithless and afraid,"
860,PART II.,"The Merciful, remembering we are dust,"
861,PART II.,"Reveals not heaven for which our hearts have prayed,"
862,PART II.,But by a token teaches us to trust;
863,PART II.,And day by day allows us to look through

876,PART II.,SOMETIMES my needle stops with half-drawn thread
877,PART II.,"(Not often though, each moment's waste means bread,"
878,PART II.,And missing stitches leave the little mouths unfed).
879,PART II.,I look down on the dingy court below:
880,PART II.,"A tuft of grass is all it has to show,--"
881,PART II.,"A broken pump, where thirsty children go."
882,PART II.,"Above, there shines a bit of sky, so small"
883,PART II.,That it might be a passing blue-bird's wing.
884,PART II.,"One tree leans up against the high brick wall,"
885,PART II.,"And there the sparrows twitter of the spring,"
886,PART II.,Until they waken in my heart a cry
887,PART II.,"Of hunger, that no bread can satisfy."
888,PART II.,
889,PART II.,"Always before, when Maytime took her way"
890,PART II.,"Across the fields, I followed close. To-day"
891,PART II.,I can but dream of all her bright array.
892,PART II.,"My work drops down. Across the sill I lean,"
893,PART II.,"And long with bitter longing, for unseen"
894,PART II.,"Rain-freshened paths, where budding woods grow green."
895,PART II.,The water trickles from the pump below
896,PART II.,"Upon the stones. With eyes half shut, I hear"
897,PART II.,"It falling in a pool where rushes grow,"
898,PART II.,And feel a cooling presence drawing near.
899,PART II.,"And now the sparrows chirp again. No, hark!--"
900,PART II.,A singing as of some far meadow lark.
901,PART II.,
902,PART II.,It is the same old miracle applied
903,PART II.,"Unto myself, that on the mountain-side"
904,PART II.,The few small loaves and fishes multiplied.
905,PART II.,"Behold, how strange and sweet the mystery!"
906,PART II.,"The birds, the broken pump, the gnarled tree,"
907,PART II.,Have brought the fullness of the spring to me.
908,PART II.,For in the leaves that rustle by the wall
909,PART II.,All forests find a tongue. And so that grass
910,PART II.,"Can, with its struggling tuft of green, recall"
911,PART II.,"Wide, bloom-filled meadows where the cattle pass."
912,PART II.,"How it can be, but dimly I divine."

973,PART II.,"Only a mirror glimmers through the dusk,"

975,PART II.,"Shows where a portrait hangs. Ah, even so"

977,PART II.,And naught remains except a space of light
978,PART II.,To show us where they were.

980,PART II.,"The busy clock, whose tell-tale talk was drowned"
981,PART II.,"By Day's uproarious voices, calls aloud,"
982,PART II.,"Undaunted by the dark, the flight of time,"

984,PART II.,"The breeze on tiptoe seems to tread, as though"
985,PART II.,It were afraid to rouse the drowsy leaves.
986,PART II.,"The long, dim street is quiet. Nothing breaks"
987,PART II.,"The dream of Night, asleep on Nature's breast."
988,PART II.,Hark! Some one passes. On the pavement stones
989,PART II.,"Each stealthy step gives back a muffled sound,"
990,PART II.,Till the last foot-fall seems in distance drowned.
991,PART II.,"So Death might pass, bent on his mission dread,"

1796,WOODBINE.,Upon the golden stairway to the throne.

1800,WOODBINE.,Men called and shouted each to each

2125,RILEY.,"Again from out the door I leaned and looked,"
2126,RILEY.,Where she should come along the leafy lane.
2127,RILEY.,And then she came.--I heard the measured sound
2128,RILEY.,"Of slow, oncoming feet, whose heavy tread"
2129,RILEY.,Seemed trampling out my life. I saw her face.
2130,RILEY.,Then through my brain a sudden numbness spread.
2131,RILEY.,"The earth seemed spun away, the sun was gone,"
2132,RILEY.,"And time, and place, and thought. There was no thing"
2133,RILEY.,"In all the universe, save one who lay"
2134,RILEY.,"So still and cold and white, unanswering"

2150,RILEY.,"Unless I deeper plow and sow,"
2151,RILEY.,"What sheaf, then, can I bring?"
