93,I. PRELUDE,
94,I. PRELUDE,"Daughter of Psyche, pledge of that last night"
95,I. PRELUDE,"When, pierced with pain and bitter-sweet delight,"
96,I. PRELUDE,"She knew her Love and saw her Lord depart,"
97,I. PRELUDE,Then breathed her wonder and her woe forlorn
98,I. PRELUDE,"Into a single cry, and thou wast born?"
99,I. PRELUDE,Thou flower of rapture and thou fruit of grief;
100,I. PRELUDE,Invisible enchantress of the heart;
101,I. PRELUDE,Mistress of charms that bring relief
102,I. PRELUDE,"To sorrow, and to joy impart"
103,I. PRELUDE,"A heavenly tone that keeps it undefiled,--"
104,I. PRELUDE,Thou art the child
105,I. PRELUDE,"Of Amor, and by right divine"
106,I. PRELUDE,"A throne of love is thine,"
107,I. PRELUDE,"Thou flower-folded, golden-girdled, star-crowned Queen,"
108,I. PRELUDE,Whose bridal beauty mortal eyes have never seen!
109,I. PRELUDE,
110,I. PRELUDE,
111,II,II
112,II,
113,II,"Thou art the Angel of the pool that sleeps,"
114,II,"While peace and joy lie hidden in its deeps,"
115,II,Waiting thy touch to make the waters roll
116,II,In healing murmurs round the weary soul.
117,II,"Ah, when wilt thou draw near,"
118,II,Thou messenger of mercy robed in song?
119,II,My lonely heart has listened for thee long;
120,II,And now I seem to hear
121,II,"Across the crowded market-place of life,"
122,II,"Thy measured foot-fall, ringing light and clear"
123,II,Above the unmeaning noises and the unruly strife;
124,II,"In quiet cadence, sweet and slow,"
125,II,"Serenely pacing to and fro,"
126,II,Thy far-off steps are magical and dear.
127,II,"Ah, turn this way, come close and speak to me!"
128,II,"From this dull bed of languor set my spirit free,"
129,II,"And bid me rise, and let me walk awhile with thee"
130,II,
131,II,
132,III,III
133,III,
134,III,Where wilt thou lead me first?
135,III,In what still region
136,III,"Of thy domain,"
137,III,"Whose provinces are legion,"
138,III,"Wilt thou restore me to myself again,"
139,III,And quench my heart's long thirst?
140,III,"I pray thee lay thy golden girdle down,"
141,III,And put away thy starry crown:
142,III,For one dear restful hour
143,III,Assume a state more mild.
144,III,Clad only in thy blossom-broidered gown
145,III,"That breathes familiar scent of many a flower,"
146,III,Take the low path that leads thro' pastures green;
147,III,"And though thou art a Queen,"
148,III,"Be Rosamund awhile, and in thy bower,"
149,III,"By tranquil love and simple joy beguiled,"
150,III,"Sing to my soul, as mother to her child."
151,III,

153,IV,IV
154,IV,
155,IV,"O lead me by the hand,"
156,IV,"And let my heart have rest,"
157,IV,"And bring me back to childhood land,"
158,IV,To find again the long-lost band
159,IV,Of playmates blithe and blest.
160,IV,
161,IV,"Some quaint, old-fashioned air,"
162,IV,"That all the children knew,"
163,IV,"Shall run before us everywhere,"
164,IV,"Like a little maid with flying hair,"
165,IV,To guide the merry crew.
166,IV,
167,IV,Along the garden ways
168,IV,"We chase the light-foot tune,"
169,IV,"And in and out the flowery maze,"
170,IV,"With eager haste and fond delays,"
171,IV,In pleasant paths of June.
172,IV,
173,IV,"For us the fields are new,"
174,IV,For us the woods are rife
175,IV,"With fairy secrets, deep and true,"
176,IV,And heaven is but a tent of blue
177,IV,Above the game of life.
178,IV,
179,IV,The world is far away:
180,IV,"The fever and the fret,"
181,IV,"And all that makes the heart grow gray,"
182,IV,"Is out of sight and far away,"
183,IV,"Dear Music, while I hear thee play"
184,IV,"That olden, golden roundelay,"
185,IV,"""Remember and forget!"""

190,V. SLEEP SONG,V. SLEEP SONG
191,V. SLEEP SONG,
192,V. SLEEP SONG,"Forget, forget!"
193,V. SLEEP SONG,The tide of life is turning;
194,V. SLEEP SONG,The waves of light ebb slowly down the west:
195,V. SLEEP SONG,Along the edge of dark some stars are burning
196,V. SLEEP SONG,To guide thy spirit safely to an isle of rest.
197,V. SLEEP SONG,A little rocking on the tranquil deep
198,V. SLEEP SONG,"Of song, to soothe thy yearning,"
199,V. SLEEP SONG,"A little slumber and a little sleep,"
200,V. SLEEP SONG,"And so, forget, forget!"
201,V. SLEEP SONG,
202,V. SLEEP SONG,"Forget, forget,--"
203,V. SLEEP SONG,The day was long in pleasure;
204,V. SLEEP SONG,Its echoes die away across the hill;
205,V. SLEEP SONG,Now let thy heart beat time to their slow measure
206,V. SLEEP SONG,"That swells, and sinks, and faints, and falls, till all is still."
207,V. SLEEP SONG,"Then, like a weary child that loves to keep"
208,V. SLEEP SONG,"Locked in its arms some treasure,"
209,V. SLEEP SONG,"Thy soul in calm content shall fall asleep,"
210,V. SLEEP SONG,"And so forget, forget."
211,V. SLEEP SONG,
212,V. SLEEP SONG,"Forget, forget,--"
213,V. SLEEP SONG,"And if thou hast been weeping,"
214,V. SLEEP SONG,Let go the thoughts that bind thee to thy grief:
215,V. SLEEP SONG,"Lie still, and watch the singing angels, reaping"
216,V. SLEEP SONG,"The golden harvest of thy sorrow, sheaf by sheaf;"
217,V. SLEEP SONG,Or count thy joys like flocks of snow-white sheep
218,V. SLEEP SONG,That one by one come creeping
219,V. SLEEP SONG,"Into the quiet fold, until thou sleep,"
220,V. SLEEP SONG,"And so forget, forget!"
221,V. SLEEP SONG,
222,V. SLEEP SONG,"Forget, forget,--"
223,V. SLEEP SONG,Thou art a child and knowest
224,V. SLEEP SONG,So little of thy life! But music tells
225,V. SLEEP SONG,One secret of the world thro' which thou goest
226,V. SLEEP SONG,"To work with morning song, to rest with evening bells:"
227,V. SLEEP SONG,Life is in tune with harmony so deep
228,V. SLEEP SONG,That when the notes are lowest
229,V. SLEEP SONG,"Thou still canst lay thee down in peace and sleep,"
230,V. SLEEP SONG,For God will not forget.
231,V. SLEEP SONG,
232,V. SLEEP SONG,

235,VI. HUNTING SONG,VI. HUNTING SONG
236,VI. HUNTING SONG,
237,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Out of the garden of playtime, out of the bower of rest,"
238,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Fain would I follow at daytime, music that calls to a quest."
239,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Hark, how the galloping measure"
240,VI. HUNTING SONG,Quickens the pulses of pleasure;
241,VI. HUNTING SONG,Gaily saluting the morn
242,VI. HUNTING SONG,With the long clear note of the hunting-horn
243,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Echoing up from the valley,"
244,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Over the mountain side,--"
245,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Rally, you hunters, rally,"
246,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Rally, and ride!"
247,VI. HUNTING SONG,
248,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Drink of the magical potion music has mixed with her wine,"
249,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Full of the madness of motion, joyful, exultant, divine!"
250,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Leave all your troubles behind you,"
251,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Ride where they never can find you,"
252,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Into the gladness of morn,"
253,VI. HUNTING SONG,"With the long, clear note of the hunting-horn,"
254,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Swiftly o'er hillock and hollow,"
255,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Sweeping along with the wind,--"
256,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Follow, you hunters, follow,"
257,VI. HUNTING SONG,Follow and find!
258,VI. HUNTING SONG,
259,VI. HUNTING SONG,What will you reach with your riding?  What is the charm of the chase?
260,VI. HUNTING SONG,Just the delight and the striding swing of the jubilant pace.
261,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Danger is sweet when you front her,--"
262,VI. HUNTING SONG,"In at the death, every hunter!"
263,VI. HUNTING SONG,Now on the breeze the mort is borne
264,VI. HUNTING SONG,"In the long, clear note of the hunting-horn,"
265,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Winding merrily, over and over,--"
266,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Come, come, come!"
267,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Home again, Ranger! home again, Rover!"
268,VI. HUNTING SONG,"Turn again, home!"

273,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,VII. DANCE-MUSIC
274,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,
275,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Now let the sleep-tune blend with the play-tune,"
276,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Weaving the mystical spell of the dance;
277,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Lighten the deep tune, soften the gay tune,"
278,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Mingle a tempo that turns in a trance.
279,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Half of it sighing, half of it smiling,"
280,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Smoothly it swings, with a triplicate beat;"
281,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Calling, replying, yearning, beguiling,"
282,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Wooing the heart and bewitching the feet.
283,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Every drop of blood
284,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Rises with the flood,"
285,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Rocking on the waves of the strain;
286,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Youth and beauty glide
287,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Turning with the tide--
288,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Music making one out of twain,"
289,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Bearing them away, and away, and away,"
290,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Like a tone and its terce--
291,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Till the chord dissolves, and the dancers stay,"
292,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,And reverse.
293,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,
294,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Violins leading, take up the measure,"
295,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Turn with the tune again,--clarinets clear"
296,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Answer their pleading,--harps full of pleasure"
297,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Sprinkle their silver like light on the mere.
298,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Semiquaver notes,"
299,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Merry little motes,"
300,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Tangled in the haze
301,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Of the lamp's golden rays,"
302,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Quiver everywhere
303,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"In the air,"
304,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Like a spray,--"
305,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Till the fuller stream of the might of the tune,"
306,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Gliding like a dream in the light of the moon,"
307,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Bears them all away, and away, and away,"
308,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Floating in the trance of the dance.
309,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,
310,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Then begins a measure stately,"
311,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Languid, slow, serene;"
312,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"All the dancers move sedately,"
313,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Stepping leisurely and straitly,"
314,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,With a courtly mien;
315,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Crossing hands and changing places,"
316,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Bowing low between,"
317,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,While the minuet inlaces
318,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Waving arms and woven paces,--"
319,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Glittering damaskeen.
320,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,Where is she whose form is folden
321,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,In its royal sheen?
322,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,From our longing eyes withholden
323,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"By her mystic girdle golden,"
324,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Beauty sought but never seen,"
325,VII. DANCE-MUSIC,"Music walks the maze, a queen."

331,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,
332,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Music, they do thee wrong who say thine art"
333,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Is only to enchant the sense.
334,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"For every timid motion of the heart,"
335,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And every passion too intense
336,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"To bear the chain of the imperfect word,"
337,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And every tremulous longing, stirred"
338,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,By spirit winds that come we know not whence
339,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And go we know not where,"
340,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And every inarticulate prayer
341,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Beating about the depths of pain or bliss,"
342,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Like some bewildered bird
343,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"That seeks its nest but knows not where it is,"
344,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And every dream that haunts, with dim delight,"
345,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"The drowsy hour between the day and night,"
346,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"The wakeful hour between the night and day,--"
347,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Imprisoned, waits for thee,"
348,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Impatient, yearns for thee,"
349,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,The queen who comes to set the captive free
350,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Thou lendest wings to grief to fly away,"
351,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And wings to joy to reach a heavenly height;
352,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And every dumb desire that Storms within the breast
353,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Thou leadest forth to sob or sing itself to rest.
354,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,
355,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"All these are thine, and therefore love is thine."
356,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"For love is joy and grief,"
357,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And trembling doubt, and certain-sure belief,"
358,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And fear, and hope, and longing unexpressed,"
359,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"In pain most human, and in rapture brief"
360,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Almost divine.
361,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Love would possess, yet deepens when denied;"
362,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And love would give, yet hungers to receive;"
363,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Love like a prince his triumph would achieve;
364,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And like a miser in the dark his joys would hide.
365,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Love is most bold:
366,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,He leads his dreams like armed men in line;
367,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Yet when the siege is set, and he must speak,"
368,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Calling the fortress to resign
369,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Its treasure, valiant love grows weak,"
370,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And hardly dares his purpose to unfold.
371,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Less with his faltering lips than with his eyes
372,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,He claims the longed-for prize:
373,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Love fain would tell it all, yet leaves the best untold."
374,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,
375,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"But thou shalt speak for love.  Yea, thou shalt teach"
376,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"The mystery of measured tone,"
377,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,The Pentecostal speech
378,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,That every listener heareth as his own.
379,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"For on thy head the cloven tongues of fire,--"
380,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Diminished chords that quiver with desire,"
381,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And major chords that glow with perfect peace,--"
382,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Have fallen from above;
383,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,And thou canst give release
384,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,In music to the burdened heart of love.
385,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,
386,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Sound with the 'cellos' pleading, passionate strain"
387,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"The yearning theme, and let the flute reply"
388,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"In placid melody, while violins complain,"
389,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And sob, and sigh,"
390,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,With muted string;
391,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Then let the oboe half-reluctant sing
392,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Of bliss that trembles on the verge of pain,"
393,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"While 'cellos plead and plead again,"
394,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"With throbbing notes delayed, that would impart"
395,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,To every urgent tone the beating of the heart.
396,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"So runs the andante, making plain"
397,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,The hopes and fears of love without a word.
398,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,
399,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Then comes the adagio, with a yielding theme"
400,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Through which the violas flow soft as in a dream,"
401,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,While horns and mild bassoons are heard
402,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"In tender tune, that seems to float"
403,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Like an enchanted boat
404,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Upon the downward-gliding stream,"
405,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Toward the allegro's wide, bright sea"
406,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Of dancing, glittering, blending tone,"
407,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"Where every instrument is sounding free,"
408,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"And harps like wedding-chimes are rung, and trumpets blown"
409,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Around the barque of love
410,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"That sweeps, with smiling skies above,"
411,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,"A royal galley, many-oared,"
412,VIII. THE SYMPHONY,Into the happy harbour of the perfect chord.

417,IX. IRIS,IX. IRIS
418,IX. IRIS,
419,IX. IRIS,"Light to the eye and Music to the ear,--"
420,IX. IRIS,These are the builders of the bridge that springs
421,IX. IRIS,From earths's dim shore of half-remembered things
422,IX. IRIS,"To reach the spirit's home, the heavenly sphere"
423,IX. IRIS,Where nothing silent is and nothing dark.
424,IX. IRIS,So when I see the rainbow's arc
425,IX. IRIS,"Spanning the showery sky, far-off I hear"
426,IX. IRIS,"Music, and every colour sings:"
427,IX. IRIS,And while the symphony builds up its round
428,IX. IRIS,Full sweep of architectural harmony
429,IX. IRIS,"Above the tide of Time, far, far away I see"
430,IX. IRIS,A bow of colour in the bow of sound.
431,IX. IRIS,
432,IX. IRIS,"Red as the dawn the trumpet rings,"
433,IX. IRIS,"Imperial purple from the trombone flows,"
434,IX. IRIS,The mellow horn melts into evening rose.
435,IX. IRIS,"Blue as the sky, the choir of strings"
436,IX. IRIS,"Darkens in double-bass to ocean's hue,"
437,IX. IRIS,"Rises in violins to noon-tide's blue,"
438,IX. IRIS,With threads of quivering light shot through and through.
439,IX. IRIS,Green as the mantle that the summer flings
440,IX. IRIS,"Around the world, the pastoral reeds in time"
441,IX. IRIS,Embroider melodies of May and June.
442,IX. IRIS,"Yellow as gold,"
443,IX. IRIS,"Yea, thrice-refined gold,"
444,IX. IRIS,"And purer than the treasures of the mine,"
445,IX. IRIS,Floods of the human voice divine
446,IX. IRIS,Along the arch in choral song are rolled.
447,IX. IRIS,So bends the bow complete:
448,IX. IRIS,And radiant rapture flows
449,IX. IRIS,"Across the bridge, so full, so strong, so sweet,"
450,IX. IRIS,That the uplifted spirit hardly knows
451,IX. IRIS,Whether the Music-Light that glows
452,IX. IRIS,Within the arch of tones and colours seven
453,IX. IRIS,"Is sunset-peace of earth, or sunrise-joy of Heaven."
454,IX. IRIS,

459,X. SEA AND SHORE,
460,X. SEA AND SHORE,"Music, I yield to thee;"
461,X. SEA AND SHORE,As swimmer to the sea
462,X. SEA AND SHORE,I give my Spirit to the flood of song:
463,X. SEA AND SHORE,Bear me upon thy breast
464,X. SEA AND SHORE,"In rapture and at rest,"
465,X. SEA AND SHORE,Bathe me in pure delight and make me strong;
466,X. SEA AND SHORE,"From strife and struggle bring release,"

836,VI,"Malice, and cold disdain,"
837,VI,"Hot anger, sullen hate,"
838,VI,"Scorn of the lowly, envy of the great,"
839,VI,And discontent that casts a shadow gray
840,VI,On all the brightness of the common day.
841,VI,
842,VI,These are the things I prize
843,VI,And hold of dearest worth:
844,VI,"Light of the sapphire skies,"
845,VI,"Peace of the silent hills,"
846,VI,"Shelter of forests, comfort of the grass,"
847,VI,"Music of birds, murmur of little rills,"
848,VI,"Shadow of clouds that swiftly pass,"
849,VI,"And, after showers,"
850,VI,The smell of flowers
851,VI,"And of the good brown earth,--"
852,VI,"And best of all, along the way, friendship and mirth."
853,VI,
854,VI,So let me keep
855,VI,These treasures of the humble heart
856,VI,"In true possession, owning them by love;"
857,VI,And when at last I can no longer move

860,VI,Let me not creep

1070,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
1071,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,It pleased the Lord of Angels (praise His name!)
1072,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"To hear, one day, report from those who came"
1073,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With pitying sorrow, or exultant joy,"
1074,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,To tell of earthly tasks in His employ:
1075,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,For some were sorry when they saw how slow
1076,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,The stream of heavenly love on earth must flow;
1077,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And some were glad because their eyes had seen,"
1078,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Along its banks, fresh flowers and living green."
1079,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"So, at a certain hour, before the throne"
1080,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The youngest angel, Asmiel, stood alone;"
1081,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Nor glad, nor sad, but full of earnest thought,"
1082,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And thus his tidings to the Master brought:
1083,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Lord, in the city Lupon I have found"
1084,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Three servants of thy holy name, renowned"
1085,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Above their fellows.  One is very wise,"
1086,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""With thoughts that ever range above the skies;"
1087,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""And one is gifted with the golden speech"
1088,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""That makes men glad to hear when he will teach;"
1089,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""And one, with no rare gift or grace endued,"
1090,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Has won the people's love by doing good."
1091,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""With three such saints Lupon is trebly blest;"
1092,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""But, Lord, I fain would know, which loves Thee best?"""
1093,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
1094,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then spake the Lord of Angels, to whose look"
1095,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,The hearts of all are like an open book:
1096,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""In every soul the secret thought I read,"
1097,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""And well I know who loves me best indeed."
1098,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""But every life has pages vacant still,"
1099,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Whereon a man may write the thing he will;"
1100,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Therefore I read in silence, day by day,"
1101,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""And wait for hearts untaught to learn my way."
1102,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""But thou shalt go to Lupon, to the three"
1103,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Who serve me there, and take this word from me:"
1104,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Tell each of them his Master bids him go"
1105,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow;"
1106,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""There he shall find a certain task for me:"
1107,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""But what, I do not tell to them nor thee."
1108,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Give thou the message, make my word the test,"
1109,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""And crown for me the one who answers best."""
1110,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Silent the angel stood, with folded hands,"
1111,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,To take the imprint of his Lord's commands;
1112,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then drew one breath, obedient and elate,"
1113,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And passed, the self-same hour, through Lupon's gate."
1114,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
1115,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,First to the Temple door he made his way;
1116,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And there, because it was an holy-day,"
1117,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"He saw the folk by thousands thronging, stirred"
1118,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,By ardent thirst to hear the preacher's word.
1119,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then, while the echoes murmured Bernol's name,"
1120,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Through aisles that hushed behind him, Bernol came;"
1121,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Strung to the keenest pitch of conscious might,"
1122,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With lips prepared and firm, and eyes alight."
1123,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,One moment at the pulpit steps he knelt
1124,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"In silent prayer, and on his shoulder felt"
1125,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel's hand:--""The Master bids thee go"
1126,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,"
1127,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""To serve Him there.""  Then Bernol's hidden face"
1128,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Went white as death, and for about the space"
1129,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Of ten slow heart-beats there was no reply;
1130,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Till Bernol looked around and whispered, ""WHY?"""
1131,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,But answer to his question came there none;
1132,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel sighed, and with a sigh was gone."
1133,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
1134,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Within the humble house where Malvin spent
1135,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"His studious years, on holy things intent,"
1136,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Sweet stillness reigned; and there the angel found
1137,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The saintly sage immersed in thought profound,"
1138,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Weaving with patient toil and willing care
1139,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"A web of wisdom, wonderful and fair:"
1140,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"A seamless robe for Truth's great bridal meet,"
1141,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And needing but one thread to be complete.
1142,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Then Asmiel touched his hand, and broke the thread"
1143,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Of fine-spun thought, and very gently said,"
1144,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""The One of whom thou thinkest bids thee go"
1145,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,"
1146,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""To serve Him there.""  With sorrow and surprise"
1147,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Malvin looked up, reluctance in his eyes."
1148,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The broken thought, the strangeness of the call,"
1149,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The perilous passage of the mountain-wall,"
1150,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The solitary journey, and the length"
1151,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Of ways unknown, too great for his frail strength,"
1152,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Appalled him.  With a doubtful brow
1153,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"He scanned the doubtful task, and muttered ""HOW?"""
1154,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But Asmiel answered, as he turned to go,"
1155,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With cold, disheartened voice, ""I do not know."""
1156,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
1157,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"Now as he went, with fading hope, to seek"
1158,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The third and last to whom God bade him speak,"
1159,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,Scarce twenty steps away whom should he meet
1160,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"But Fermor, hurrying cheerful down the street,"
1161,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"With ready heart that faced his work like play,"
1162,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And joyed to find it greater every day!
1163,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel stopped him with uplifted hand,"
1164,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And gave without delay his Lord's command:
1165,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""He whom thou servest here would have thee go"
1166,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Alone to Spiran's huts, across the snow,"
1167,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""To serve Him there.""  Ere Asmiel breathed again"
1168,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The eager answer leaped to meet him, ""WHEN?"""
1169,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,
1170,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"The angel's face with inward joy grew bright,"
1171,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,And all his figure glowed with heavenly light;
1172,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,He took the golden circlet from his brow
1173,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"And gave the crown to Fermor, answering, ""Now!"
1174,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""For thou hast met the Master's bidden test,"
1175,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""And I have found the man who loves Him best."
1176,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Not thine, nor mine, to question or reply"
1177,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""When He commands us, asking 'how?' or 'why?'"
1178,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""He knows the cause; His ways are wise and just;"
1179,A LEGEND OF SERVICE,"""Who serves the King must serve with perfect trust."""

1187,THE VAIN KING,
1188,THE VAIN KING,"In robes of Tyrian blue the King was drest,"
1189,THE VAIN KING,"A jewelled collar shone upon his breast,"
1190,THE VAIN KING,A giant ruby glittered in his crown--
1191,THE VAIN KING,Lord of rich lands and many a splendid town.
1192,THE VAIN KING,In him the glories of an ancient line
1193,THE VAIN KING,"Of sober kings, who ruled by right divine,"
1194,THE VAIN KING,Were centred; and to him with loyal awe
1195,THE VAIN KING,The people looked for leadership and law.
1196,THE VAIN KING,"Ten thousand knights, the safeguard of the land,"
1197,THE VAIN KING,Lay like a single sword within his hand;
1198,THE VAIN KING,"A hundred courts, with power of life and death,"
1199,THE VAIN KING,Proclaimed decrees of justice by his breath;
1200,THE VAIN KING,And all the sacred growths that men had known
1201,THE VAIN KING,Of order and of rule upheld his throne.
1202,THE VAIN KING,
1203,THE VAIN KING,Proud was the King: yet not with such a heart
1204,THE VAIN KING,As fits a man to play a royal part.
1205,THE VAIN KING,Not his the pride that honours as a trust
1206,THE VAIN KING,"The right to rule, the duty to be just:"
1207,THE VAIN KING,Not his the dignity that bends to bear
1208,THE VAIN KING,"The monarch's yoke, the master's load of care,"
1209,THE VAIN KING,"And labours like the peasant at his gate,"
1210,THE VAIN KING,To serve the people and protect the State.
1211,THE VAIN KING,"Another pride was his, and other joys:"
1212,THE VAIN KING,"To him the crown and sceptre were but toys,"
1213,THE VAIN KING,"With which he played at glory's idle game,"
1214,THE VAIN KING,To please himself and win the wreaths of fame.
1215,THE VAIN KING,"The throne his fathers held from age to age,"
1216,THE VAIN KING,"To his ambition, seemed a fitting stage"
1217,THE VAIN KING,"Built for King Martin to display at will,"
1218,THE VAIN KING,His mighty strength and universal skill.
1219,THE VAIN KING,
1220,THE VAIN KING,"No conscious child, that, spoiled with praising, tries"
1221,THE VAIN KING,"At every step to win admiring eyes,--"
1222,THE VAIN KING,"No favourite mountebank, whose acting draws"
1223,THE VAIN KING,"From gaping crowds loud thunder of applause,"
1224,THE VAIN KING,Was vainer than the King: his only thirst
1225,THE VAIN KING,"Was to be hailed, in every race, the first."
1226,THE VAIN KING,"When tournament was held, in knightly guise"
1227,THE VAIN KING,The King would ride the lists and win the prize;
1228,THE VAIN KING,"When music charmed the court, with golden lyre"
1229,THE VAIN KING,The King would take the stage and lead the choir;
1230,THE VAIN KING,"In hunting, his the lance to slay the boar;"
1231,THE VAIN KING,"In hawking, see his falcon highest soar;"
1232,THE VAIN KING,"In painting, he would wield the master's brush;"
1233,THE VAIN KING,"In high debate,--""the King is speaking! Hush!"""
1234,THE VAIN KING,"Thus, with a restless heart, in every field"
1235,THE VAIN KING,"He sought renown, and found his subjects yield"
1236,THE VAIN KING,As if he were a demi-god revealed.
1237,THE VAIN KING,
1238,THE VAIN KING,But while he played the petty games of life
1239,THE VAIN KING,His kingdom fell a prey to inward strife;
1240,THE VAIN KING,"Corruption through the court unheeded crept,"
1241,THE VAIN KING,And on the seat of honour justice slept.
1242,THE VAIN KING,The strong trod down the weak; the helpless poor
1243,THE VAIN KING,Groaned under burdens grievous to endure.
1244,THE VAIN KING,"The nation's wealth was spent in vain display,"
1245,THE VAIN KING,And weakness wore the nation's heart away.
1246,THE VAIN KING,
1247,THE VAIN KING,Yet think not Earth is blind to human woes--
1248,THE VAIN KING,Man has more friends and helpers than he knows;
1249,THE VAIN KING,"And when a patient people are oppressed,"
1250,THE VAIN KING,The land that bore them feels it in her breast.
1251,THE VAIN KING,"Spirits of field and flood, of heath and hill,"
1252,THE VAIN KING,Are grieved and angry at the spreading ill;
1253,THE VAIN KING,"The trees complain together in the night,"
1254,THE VAIN KING,"Voices of wrath are heard along the height,"
1255,THE VAIN KING,"And secret vows are sworn, by stream and strand,"
1256,THE VAIN KING,To bring the tyrant low and liberate the land.
1257,THE VAIN KING,
1258,THE VAIN KING,But little recked the pampered King of these;
1259,THE VAIN KING,He heard no voice but such as praise and please.
1260,THE VAIN KING,"Flattered and fooled, victor in every sport,"
1261,THE VAIN KING,One day he wandered idly with his court
1262,THE VAIN KING,"Beside the river, seeking to devise"
1263,THE VAIN KING,New ways to show his skill to wondering eyes.
1264,THE VAIN KING,"There in the stream a patient fisher stood,"
1265,THE VAIN KING,And cast his line across the rippling flood.
1266,THE VAIN KING,His silver spoil lay near him on the green:
1267,THE VAIN KING,"""Such fish,"" the courtiers cried, ""were never seen!"
1268,THE VAIN KING,"""Three salmon longer than a cloth-yard shaft--"
1269,THE VAIN KING,"""This man must be the master of his craft!"""
1270,THE VAIN KING,"""An easy art!"" the jealous King replied:"
1271,THE VAIN KING,"""Myself could learn it better, if I tried,"
1272,THE VAIN KING,"""And catch a hundred larger fish a week--"
1273,THE VAIN KING,"""Wilt thou accept the challenge, fellow? Speak!"""
1274,THE VAIN KING,"The fisher turned, came near, and bent his knee:"

1287,THE VAIN KING,Sure such a sight was never seen before!
1288,THE VAIN KING,For robed and crowned the monarch trod the shore;

1290,THE VAIN KING,His jewelled reel ran out a silken line.
1291,THE VAIN KING,"With kingly strokes he flogged the crystal stream,"

1297,THE VAIN KING,"Called for a net, and cast it far and wide,"
