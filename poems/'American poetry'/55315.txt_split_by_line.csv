171,CONTENTS,To my Beloved Sister Appey
172,CONTENTS,
173,CONTENTS,This little book is lovingly dedicated
174,CONTENTS,
175,CONTENTS,
176,CONTENTS,"The memory of her beautiful life, and of her deep and unchanging love"
177,CONTENTS,"for me,--together with the knowledge of the interest she felt in my"
178,CONTENTS,"writings, fills me with a longing to do that which I know would be"
179,CONTENTS,pleasing to her.
180,CONTENTS,
181,CONTENTS,For though the dear voice of her whom I so loved can no longer cheer and
182,CONTENTS,"guide me on, yet in spirit I hear her gently whisper bidding me resume"
183,CONTENTS,the work I had laid aside.
184,CONTENTS,
185,CONTENTS,"Thus from my writings I have selected a few poems which, though"
186,CONTENTS,"submitted with diffidence, I hope may be kindly received by my many"
187,CONTENTS,friends; and accepted by them with such degree of generosity as will
188,CONTENTS,"enable them to throw the mantle of charity over the many short-comings,"
189,CONTENTS,and to see any good that may chance to exist.
190,CONTENTS,
191,CONTENTS,And if from any of these poems there may perchance be found one little
192,CONTENTS,ray of sunshine--though it beams ever so faintly--that may radiate and
193,CONTENTS,"give pleasure to even _one_ appreciating heart, then surely I may feel"
194,CONTENTS,that my labor will not have been wholly in vain.

299,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,
300,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,"The south wind returns, with a gentle caress"
301,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,And it kisses the lakelets’ bright waves;
302,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,And softly it moans in low musical tones
303,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,As it sighs through the mystical caves.
304,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,"Sweet Summer is waiting to welcome the rose,"
305,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Who is queen of the flowery band--

308,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,
309,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Drowsy and low is the hum of the bees
310,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,As the nectar they sip from the bloom;
311,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,"The rivulet courses, all nature rejoices,"
312,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,For Winter is laid in the tomb.
313,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Gaily among the green arches the birds
314,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Pour forth their thanksgiving in song;
315,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,"Their clear, mellow notes in pure cadence floats"
316,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,As the echoing gale sweeps along.
317,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,
318,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,The hillside with blushes lifts up its fair head
319,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,In its verdurous beauty so proud;
320,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,And the flower-faces gleam as a loving sunbeam
321,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Wafts down from the light fleecy cloud.
322,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,"The grand, lofty mountain where hangs the white mist"
323,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Tells the brooklets of Summer’s warm glow;
324,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,"And they in turn hail each glen, woodland and vale"
325,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,Where the soft willow catkins bend low.
326,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,
327,_WELCOME TO SUMMER_,The flowerets join the harmonious strain

863,_THE CAPTIVE BUTTERFLY_,Vainly the poor insect fluttered

1505,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Were he here now, ah, could I forgive him--"
1506,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Would duty, and right, say I must?"
1507,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Could I extend the hand-grasp of friendship
1508,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,To him who has broken that trust?
1509,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,I can only _pray God_ to forgive him--
1510,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And me. For with memory’s stamp
1511,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Comes the knowledge of why I am needy--
1512,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And why people call me--a tramp.
1513,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1514,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"I sold our dear cot mid the roses,"
1515,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And stealthily set out to trace
1516,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"The whereabouts of my dear loved ones,"
1517,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And I wandered from place to place
1518,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,At last came the sorrowful tidings
1519,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Of a ship going down in a gale,--"
1520,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Their names, on the list of the lost ones!"
1521,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And this is the end of the tale.
1522,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1523,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"From my great sorrow then I sought refuge,"
1524,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And I drifted from east to the west;
1525,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"In my young days I worked hard and steady,"
1526,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,In every place doing my best.
1527,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"But now there ’s no work,--I’m heart broken.--"
1528,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Alone, in the cold and the damp,--"
1529,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,To my poor heart it seems--save in Heaven
1530,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"There’s no room for the poor, aged tramp."

1542,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,If anything _special_ she wished to hear
1543,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,She’d put a trumpet to her ear.
1544,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"_Without_ the instrument, she could at best"
1545,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,But hear _some_--and _guess_ the _rest_.
1546,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1547,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,One day she laid it on a chair--
1548,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Got up, and left it lying there--"
1549,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And went to work sweeping the floor
1550,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Just as a peddler reached the door.
1551,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And to the man it did occur
1552,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,That he might sell some goods to her.
1553,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1554,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Good morning Marm, fine day,” quoth he--"
1555,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“I thought I’d just call, and see”--"
1556,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Just come from sea! is that what ye say?
1557,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Well, and who are ye any way?”"
1558,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Oh, pray excuse me marm! I said--"
1559,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,I simply called to sell some thread”--
1560,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1561,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Swell on the head? well there I vow--
1562,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,What you been up to any how?”
1563,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Beg pardon marm!”--at her he stared,"
1564,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“But is your hearing not impared?”
1565,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“My herrings pared? Yes, scraped off the scales"
1566,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,And then cut off the heads and tails!”
1567,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1568,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,The peddler’s voice grew loud and louder:--
1569,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Say marm! don’t you want to buy some powder?
1570,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Here is one dozen shell hair pins”--
1571,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“What! want to sell a pair of twins?
1572,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Why man, you make a body laugh,"
1573,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,I’d rather buy a Jersey calf--
1574,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1575,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"Me! buy them twins!”--“Madam, your wrong!"
1576,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Have been mistaken all along!”--
1577,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Didn’t take ’em along? it’s just as well,"
1578,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,For twins ain’t very good to sell.”
1579,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Excuse me marm--but my belief
1580,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Is that you must be a little deaf!”
1581,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1582,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“A little beef?--for dinner--hey?
1583,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Beef and herrings did you say?”
1584,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“I didn’t say so!” he loudly roar’d--
1585,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,But his voice took wing and upward soar’d.
1586,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Don’t worry--you won’t have to wait,"
1587,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,I’ll get your dinner before ’tis late.”
1588,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1589,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Don’t want no dinner!” he yelled in her ear,--"
1590,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Gal darn ye! can’t I make ye hear?”
1591,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“_Hain’t got no beer_ for you,” said she,"
1592,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“You needn’t get mad and swear at me!”
1593,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,"“Beg pardon!” he yelled with voice immense,"
1594,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“But I certainly mean’t you no offence”--

1596,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Fence? you’ll find out if there’s a fence or not

1600,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“To sell you something was my plan--

1602,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,
1603,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,“Me want a man! how could you guess?
1604,_THE TRAMP’S STORY_,Of course my answer must be yes.

2439,_MAMMA’S STORY_,As snugly it nestled ’neath the boy’s ragged frock

2998,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And found ’twas Brother Heald
2999,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And on the self same purpose bent!
3000,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Lute straightway feared the worst;
3001,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,It but remained now to be seen
3002,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Which one would get there first!
3003,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3004,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Lucius quickened up his pace
3005,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"Nor stopped for rocks or planks,"
3006,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,’Tis said his record equaled then
3007,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,The far-famed Nancy Hanks!
3008,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"He nearly now his courage lost,"
3009,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,The way seemed not so clear
3010,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,To be the first to break the ground
3011,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,With _tother feller_ near.
3012,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3013,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,So in the road the spade he dropped
3014,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And scooped it full of earth
3015,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Then sprang with all his wondrous might
3016,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And ran for all he’s worth
3017,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"And dumped that sand upon the spot,"
3018,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And made a little mound--
3019,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"“Ah, ha!” quoth he, “_I am_ the first"
3020,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,To break the Grange Hall ground!”
3021,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3022,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Then with a sigh both turned away--
3023,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,They felt somewhat--perhaps
3024,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,One like the ‘Russians’ at bay--
3025,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,The other like the ‘Japs.’--
3026,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"The morning dawned with azure skies,"
3027,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And then the workmen came;
3028,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Brad Damon and another man
3029,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Sir William Brown by name.
3030,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3031,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"They saw the sand, and then one spoke--"
3032,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"(The other followed suit,)"
3033,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"“What tarnal fool done this, d’ye spose?"
3034,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"I vum, I’ll bet ’twas Lute!”"
3035,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"The other answered, “I’ve no doubt"
3036,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"’Twas him, but see these tracks--"
3037,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"Now you don’t spose dew ye, they"
3038,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Resemble Danville Jack’s?”
3039,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3040,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"“Oh, no, taint Dan--I know ’tis Lute--"
3041,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,To reason _this_ appeals:--
3042,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,These tracks look like an Elephant
3043,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,While _Dan’s_ got _Nigger heels_!”
3044,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"Then exclamations volleyed forth,"
3045,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,With laughter long and loud;
3046,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Just then Geo. Record’s silvery voice
3047,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Came ringing through the crowd:
3048,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3049,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"“I say there, _Bill_! Tim Jones’n me"
3050,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Will give fifty cents in change
3051,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,To whom will write this story up
3052,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And read it in the Grange!”
3053,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Five poetic pencils glibly glide--
3054,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Low bends each thoughtful head--
3055,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"Presented for inspections, thus"
3056,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Brad Damon’s poem read:--
3057,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3058,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Lucius Record
3059,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"Sat up late,--"
3060,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Broke the ground--
3061,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Honor great.
3062,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3063,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Road to fame--
3064,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,"Show’s us how,--"
3065,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Pile of dirt--
3066,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Big’s a cow.
3067,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3068,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Danville Jack--
3069,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Gloomy feels--

3074,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Awfully mute--

3082,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,
3083,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,“By Gum! he’s beaten us all!” they cried
3084,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Between their tight--shut teeth;
3085,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Then brushed away that pile of sand
3086,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,And saw what lay beneath!
3087,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,They cried “Let’s give three cheers for Lute!
3088,_A TALE FROM MOUNTAIN GRANGE_,Of him we have learned this day

3171,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,
3172,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,And I suppose that this here way

3203,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,I wish that them ere pesky folks
3204,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,Would let the pole alone;
3205,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,I think that they had better find

3207,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,
3208,_UNCLE JOE’S SOLILOQUY_,I wish some one would find them folks
