41,INTRODUCTION.,
42,INTRODUCTION.,"From whatever point of view the character of Eugene Field is seen,"
43,INTRODUCTION.,genius--rare and quaint presents itself is childlike simplicity. That he
44,INTRODUCTION.,"was a poet of keen perception, of rare discrimination, all will admit."
45,INTRODUCTION.,"He was a humorist as delicate and fanciful as Artemus Ward, Mark Twain,"
46,INTRODUCTION.,"Bill Nye, James Whitcomb Riley, Opie Read, or Bret Harte in their"
47,INTRODUCTION.,"happiest moods. Within him ran a poetic vein, capable of being worked in"
48,INTRODUCTION.,"any direction, and from which he could, at will, extract that which"
49,INTRODUCTION.,his imagination saw and felt most. That he occasionally left the
50,INTRODUCTION.,"child-world, in which he longed to linger, to wander among the older"
51,INTRODUCTION.,"children of men, where intuitively the hungry listener follows him into"
52,INTRODUCTION.,"his Temple of Mirth, all should rejoice, for those who knew him not, can"
53,INTRODUCTION.,while away the moments imbibing the genius of his imagination in the
54,INTRODUCTION.,poetry and prose here presented.
55,INTRODUCTION.,
56,INTRODUCTION.,"Though never possessing an intimate acquaintanceship with Field, owing"
57,INTRODUCTION.,"largely to the disparity in our ages, still there existed a bond"
58,INTRODUCTION.,of friendliness that renders my good opinion of him in a measure
59,INTRODUCTION.,"trustworthy. Born in the same city, both students in the same college,"
60,INTRODUCTION.,engaged at various times in newspaper work both in St. Louis and
61,INTRODUCTION.,"Chicago, residents of the same ward, with many mutual friends, it is not"
62,INTRODUCTION.,"surprising that I am able to say of him that ""the world is better off"
63,INTRODUCTION.,"that he lived, not in gold and silver or precious jewels, but in the"
64,INTRODUCTION.,"bestowal of priceless truths, of which the possessor of this book"
65,INTRODUCTION.,"becomes a benefactor of no mean share of his estate."""
66,INTRODUCTION.,
67,INTRODUCTION.,"Every lover of Field, whether of the songs of childhood or the poems"
68,INTRODUCTION.,"that lend mirth to the out-pouring of his poetic nature, will welcome"
69,INTRODUCTION.,this unique collection of his choicest wit and humor.

140,JOHN SMITH.,
141,JOHN SMITH.,
142,JOHN SMITH.,To-day I strayed in Charing Cross as wretched as could be
143,JOHN SMITH.,With thinking of my home and friends across the tumbling sea;
144,JOHN SMITH.,"There was no water in my eyes, but my spirits were depressed"
145,JOHN SMITH.,"And my heart lay like a sodden, soggy doughnut in my breast."
146,JOHN SMITH.,"This way and that streamed multitudes, that gayly passed me by--"
147,JOHN SMITH.,Not one in all the crowd knew me and not a one knew I!
148,JOHN SMITH.,"""Oh, for a touch of home!"" I sighed; ""oh, for a friendly face!"
149,JOHN SMITH.,"Oh, for a hearty handclasp in this teeming desert place!"""
150,JOHN SMITH.,"And so, soliloquizing as a homesick creature will,"
151,JOHN SMITH.,"Incontinent, I wandered down the noisy, bustling hill"
152,JOHN SMITH.,"And drifted, automatic-like and vaguely, into Lowe's,"
153,JOHN SMITH.,Where Fortune had in store a panacea for my woes.
154,JOHN SMITH.,"The register was open, and there dawned upon my sight"
155,JOHN SMITH.,A name that filled and thrilled me with a cyclone of delight--
156,JOHN SMITH.,The name that I shall venerate unto my dying day--
157,JOHN SMITH.,"The proud, immortal signature: ""John Smith, U.S.A."""
158,JOHN SMITH.,
159,JOHN SMITH.,Wildly I clutched the register and brooded on that name--
160,JOHN SMITH.,"I knew John Smith, yet could not well identify the same."
161,JOHN SMITH.,"I knew him North, I knew him South, I knew him East and West--"
162,JOHN SMITH.,I knew him all so well I knew not which I knew the best.
163,JOHN SMITH.,"His eyes, I recollect, were gray, and black, and brown, and blue,"
164,JOHN SMITH.,"And, when he was not bald, his hair was of chameleon hue;"
165,JOHN SMITH.,"Lean, fat, tall, short, rich, poor, grave, gay, a blonde and a brunette--"
166,JOHN SMITH.,"Aha, amid this London fog, John Smith, I see you yet;"
167,JOHN SMITH.,"I see you yet, and yet the sight is all so blurred I seem"
168,JOHN SMITH.,"To see you in composite, or as in a waking dream,"
169,JOHN SMITH.,"Which are you, John? I'd like to know, that I might weave a rhyme"
170,JOHN SMITH.,"Appropriate to your character, your politics and clime;"
171,JOHN SMITH.,"So tell me, were you ""raised"" or ""reared""--your pedigree confess"
172,JOHN SMITH.,"In some such treacherous ism as ""I reckon"" or ""I guess"";"
173,JOHN SMITH.,"Let fall your tell-tale dialect, that instantly I may"
174,JOHN SMITH.,"Identify my countryman, ""John Smith, U.S.A."""
175,JOHN SMITH.,
176,JOHN SMITH.,It's like as not you are the John that lived a spell ago
177,JOHN SMITH.,"Down East, where codfish, beans 'nd bona-fide school-marms grow;"
178,JOHN SMITH.,Where the dear old homestead nestles like among the Hampshire hills
179,JOHN SMITH.,And where the robin hops about the cherry boughs and trills;
180,JOHN SMITH.,"Where Hubbard squash 'nd huckleberries grow to powerful size,"
181,JOHN SMITH.,And everything is orthodox from preachers down to pies;
182,JOHN SMITH.,"Where the red-wing blackbirds swing 'nd call beside the pickril pond,"
183,JOHN SMITH.,And the crows air cawin' in the pines uv the pasture lot beyond;
184,JOHN SMITH.,"Where folks complain uv bein' poor, because their money's lent"
185,JOHN SMITH.,Out West on farms 'nd railroads at the rate uv ten per cent;
186,JOHN SMITH.,"Where we ust to spark the Baker girls a-comin' home from choir,"
187,JOHN SMITH.,Or a-settin' namin' apples round the roarin' kitchen fire:
188,JOHN SMITH.,"Where we had to go to meetin' at least three times a week,"
189,JOHN SMITH.,"And our mothers learnt us good religious Dr. Watts to speak,"
190,JOHN SMITH.,"And where our grandmas sleep their sleep--God rest their souls, I say!"
191,JOHN SMITH.,"And God bless yours, ef you're that John, ""John Smith, U.S.A."""
192,JOHN SMITH.,
193,JOHN SMITH.,"Or, mebbe, Colonel Smith, yo' are the gentleman I know"
194,JOHN SMITH.,In the country whar the finest democrats 'nd horses grow;
195,JOHN SMITH.,Whar the ladies are all beautiful an' whar the crap of cawn
196,JOHN SMITH.,Is utilized for Bourbon and true dawters are bawn;
197,JOHN SMITH.,"You've ren for jedge, and killed yore man, and bet on Proctor Knott--"
198,JOHN SMITH.,"Yore heart is full of chivalry, yore skin is full of shot;"
199,JOHN SMITH.,And I disremember whar I've met with gentlemen so true
200,JOHN SMITH.,"As yo' all in Kaintucky, whar blood an' grass are blue;"
201,JOHN SMITH.,"Whar a niggah with a ballot is the signal fo' a fight,"
202,JOHN SMITH.,Whar a yaller dawg pursues the coon throughout the bammy night;
203,JOHN SMITH.,Whar blooms the furtive 'possum--pride an' glory of the South--
204,JOHN SMITH.,"And Aunty makes a hoe-cake, sah, that melts within yo' mouth!"
205,JOHN SMITH.,"Whar, all night long, the mockin'-birds are warblin' in the trees"
206,JOHN SMITH.,"And black-eyed Susans nod and blink at every passing breeze,"
207,JOHN SMITH.,Whar in a hallowed soil repose the ashes of our Clay--
208,JOHN SMITH.,"Hyar's lookin' at yo', Colonel ""John Smith, U.S.A.""!"
209,JOHN SMITH.,
210,JOHN SMITH.,Or wuz you that John Smith I knew out yonder in the West--
211,JOHN SMITH.,That part of our republic I shall always love the best?
212,JOHN SMITH.,Wuz you him that went prospectin' in the spring of sixty-nine
213,JOHN SMITH.,In the Red Hoss mountain country for the Gosh-All-Hemlock Mine?
214,JOHN SMITH.,"Oh, how I'd like to clasp your hand an' set down by your side"
215,JOHN SMITH.,And talk about the good old days beyond the big divide;
216,JOHN SMITH.,"Of the rackaboar, the snaix, the bear, the Rocky Mountain goat,"
217,JOHN SMITH.,"Of the conversazzhyony 'nd of Casey's tabble-dote,"
218,JOHN SMITH.,And a word of them old pardners that stood by us long ago
219,JOHN SMITH.,"(Three-Fingered Hoover, Sorry Tom and Parson Jim, you know)!"
220,JOHN SMITH.,"Old times, old friends, John Smith, would make our hearts beat high"
221,JOHN SMITH.,"again,"
222,JOHN SMITH.,And we'd see the snow-top mountain like we used to see 'em then;
223,JOHN SMITH.,"The magpies would go flutterin' like strange sperrits to 'nd fro,"
224,JOHN SMITH.,And we'd hear the pines a-singing' in the ragged gulch below;
225,JOHN SMITH.,"And the mountain brook would loiter like upon its windin' way,"
226,JOHN SMITH.,Ez if it waited for a child to jine it in its play.
227,JOHN SMITH.,
228,JOHN SMITH.,"You see, John Smith, just which you are I cannot well recall,"
229,JOHN SMITH.,"And, really, I am pleased to think you somehow must be all!"
230,JOHN SMITH.,For when a man sojourns abroad awhile (as I have done)
231,JOHN SMITH.,He likes to think of all the folks he left at home as one--
232,JOHN SMITH.,And so they are! For well you know there's nothing in a name---
233,JOHN SMITH.,"Our Browns, our Joneses and our Smiths are happily the same;"
234,JOHN SMITH.,"All represent the spirit of the land across the sea,"
235,JOHN SMITH.,All stand for one high purpose in our country of the free!
236,JOHN SMITH.,"Whether John Smith be from the South, the North, the West, the East--"
237,JOHN SMITH.,"So long as he's American, it mattereth not the least;"
238,JOHN SMITH.,"Whether his crest be badger, bear, palmetto, sword or pine,"
239,JOHN SMITH.,He is the glory of the stars that with the stripes combine!
240,JOHN SMITH.,"Where'er he be, whate'er his lot, he's eager to be known,"
241,JOHN SMITH.,"Not by his mortal name, but by his country's name alone!"
242,JOHN SMITH.,"And so, compatriot, I am proud you wrote your name to-day"
243,JOHN SMITH.,"Upon the register at Lowe's, ""John Smith, U.S.A."""

249,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
250,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
251,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Of all the gracious gifts of Spring,"
252,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Is there another can safely surpass
253,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"This delicate, voluptuous thing--"
254,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"This dapple-green, plump-shouldered bass?"
255,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Upon a damask napkin laid,"
256,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,What exhalations superfine
257,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Our gustatory nerves pervade,"
258,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Provoking quenchless thirsts for wine.
259,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
260,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"The ancients loved this noble fish,"
261,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"And, coming from the kitchen fire"
262,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"All piping hot upon a dish,"
263,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,What raptures did he not inspire!
264,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"""Fish should swim twice,"" they used to say--"
265,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Once in their native vapid brine,"
266,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,And then a better way--
267,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,You understand? Fetch on the wine!
268,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
269,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Ah, dainty monarch of the flood,"
270,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,How often have I cast for you--
271,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,How often sadly seen you scud
272,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Where weeds and pussy willows grew!
273,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,How often have you filched my bait!
274,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,How often have you snapped my treacherous line!--
275,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Yet here I have you on this plate.
276,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"You _shall_ swim twice, and _now_ in _wine_!"
277,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
278,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"And, harkee, garcon! let the blood"
279,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Of cobwebbed years be spilt for him--
280,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Aye, in a rich Burgundy flood"
281,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,This piscatorial pride should swim;
282,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"So, were he living, he should say"
283,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"He gladly died for me and mine,"
284,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"And, as it was his native spray,"
285,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"He'd lash the sauce--What, ho! the wine!"
286,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
287,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,I would it were ordained for me
288,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"To share your fate, oh finny friend!"
289,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,I surely were not loath to be
290,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Reserved for such a noble end;
291,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"For when old Chronos, gaunt and grim,"
292,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"At last reels in his ruthless line,"
293,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,What were my ecstacy to swim
294,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"In wine, in wine, in glorious wine!"
295,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,
296,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"Well, here's a health to you, sweet Spring!"
297,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"And, prithee, whilst I stick to earth,"
298,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,Come hither every year and bring
299,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,The boons provocative of mirth;
300,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"And should your stock of bass run low,"
301,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,"However much I might repine,"
302,THE FISHERMAN'S FEAST.,I think I might survive the blow

350,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.
351,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
352,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
353,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,Once on a time a friend of mine prevailed on me to go
354,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"To see the dazzling splendors of a sinful ballet show,"
355,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,And after we had reveled in the saltatory sights
356,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,We sought a neighboring cafe for more tangible delights;
357,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"When I demanded of my friend what viands he preferred,"
358,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"He quoth: ""A large cold bottle and a small hot bird!"""
359,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
360,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"Fool that I was, I did not know what anguish hidden lies"
361,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,Within the morceau that allures the nostrils and the eyes!
362,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,There is a glorious candor in an honest quart of wine--
363,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,A certain inspiration which I cannot well define!
364,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"How it bubbles, how it sparkles, how its gurgling seems to say:"
365,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"""Come, on a tide of rapture let me float your soul away!"""
366,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
367,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"But the crispy, steaming mouthful that is spread upon your plate--"
368,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,How it discounts human sapience and satirizes fate!
369,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,You wouldn't think a thing so small could cause the pains and aches
370,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,That certainly accrue to him that of that thing partakes;
371,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"To me, at least (a guileless wight!) it never once occurred"
372,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,What horror was encompassed in that one small hot bird.
373,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
374,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"Oh, what a head I had on me when I awoke next day,"
375,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,And what a firm conviction of intestinal decay!
376,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,What seas of mineral water and of bromide I applied
377,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,To quench those fierce volcanic fires that rioted inside!
378,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"And, oh! the thousand solemn, awful vows I plighted then"
379,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,Never to tax my system with a small hot bird again!
380,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
381,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"The doctor seemed to doubt that birds could worry people so,"
382,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"But, bless him! since I ate the bird, I guess I ought to know!"
383,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"The acidous condition of my stomach, so he said,"
384,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"Bespoke a vinous irritant that amplified my head,"
385,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"And, ergo, the causation of the thing, as he inferred,"
386,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"Was the large cold bottle, not the small hot bird."
387,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,
388,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"Of course, I know it wasn't, and I'm sure you'll say I'm right"
389,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,If ever it has been your wont to train around at night;
390,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"How sweet is retrospection when one's heart is bathed in wine,"
391,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,And before its balmy breath how do the ills of life decline!
392,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,"How the gracious juices drown what griefs would vex a mortal breast,"
393,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,And float the flattered soul into the port of dreamless rest!
394,THE BOTTLE AND THE BIRD.,

844,FITTE THE FIRST.,FITTE THE FIRST.
845,FITTE THE FIRST.,
846,FITTE THE FIRST.,The pup was of a noble mein
847,FITTE THE FIRST.,As e'er you gazed upon;
848,FITTE THE FIRST.,They called his mother Lady
849,FITTE THE FIRST.,And his father was a Don.
850,FITTE THE FIRST.,
851,FITTE THE FIRST.,And both his mother and his sire
852,FITTE THE FIRST.,Were of the race Bernard--
853,FITTE THE FIRST.,The family famed in histories
854,FITTE THE FIRST.,And hymned of every bard.
855,FITTE THE FIRST.,
856,FITTE THE FIRST.,"His form was of exuberant mold,"
857,FITTE THE FIRST.,"Long, slim and loose of joints;"
858,FITTE THE FIRST.,There never was a pointer-dog
859,FITTE THE FIRST.,So full as he of points.
860,FITTE THE FIRST.,
861,FITTE THE FIRST.,"His hair was like a yellow fleece,"
862,FITTE THE FIRST.,"His eyes were black and kind,"
863,FITTE THE FIRST.,"And like a nodding, gilded plume"
864,FITTE THE FIRST.,His tail stuck up behind.
865,FITTE THE FIRST.,
866,FITTE THE FIRST.,"His bark was very, very fierce"
867,FITTE THE FIRST.,"And fierce his appetite,"
868,FITTE THE FIRST.,Yet was it only things to eat
869,FITTE THE FIRST.,That he was prone to bite.
870,FITTE THE FIRST.,
871,FITTE THE FIRST.,But in that one particular
872,FITTE THE FIRST.,He was so passing true
873,FITTE THE FIRST.,That never did he quit a meal
874,FITTE THE FIRST.,Until he had got through.
875,FITTE THE FIRST.,
876,FITTE THE FIRST.,"Potatoes, biscuits, mush or hash,"
877,FITTE THE FIRST.,"Joint, chop, or chicken limb--"
878,FITTE THE FIRST.,"So long as it was edible,"
879,FITTE THE FIRST.,'Twas all the same to him!
880,FITTE THE FIRST.,
881,FITTE THE FIRST.,And frequently when Hunger's pangs
882,FITTE THE FIRST.,"Assailed that callow pup,"
883,FITTE THE FIRST.,He masticated boots and gloves
884,FITTE THE FIRST.,Or chewed a door-mat up.
885,FITTE THE FIRST.,
886,FITTE THE FIRST.,So was he much beholden of
887,FITTE THE FIRST.,The folk that him did keep;
888,FITTE THE FIRST.,They loved him when he was awake
889,FITTE THE FIRST.,And better still asleep.
890,FITTE THE FIRST.,
891,FITTE THE FIRST.,
892,FITTE THE SECOND.,FITTE THE SECOND.
893,FITTE THE SECOND.,
894,FITTE THE SECOND.,Now once his master lingering o'er
895,FITTE THE SECOND.,"His breakfast coffee-cup,"
896,FITTE THE SECOND.,Observed unto his doting spouse:
897,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""You ought to wash the pup!"""
898,FITTE THE SECOND.,
899,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""That shall I do this very day,"""
900,FITTE THE SECOND.,His doting spouse replied;
901,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""You will not know the pretty thing"
902,FITTE THE SECOND.,When he is washed and dried.
903,FITTE THE SECOND.,
904,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""But tell me, dear, before you go"
905,FITTE THE SECOND.,"Unto your daily work,"
906,FITTE THE SECOND.,"Shall I use Ivory soap on him,"
907,FITTE THE SECOND.,"Or Colgate, Pears' or Kirk?"""
908,FITTE THE SECOND.,
909,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""Odzooks, it matters not a whit--"
910,FITTE THE SECOND.,They all are good to use!
911,FITTE THE SECOND.,"Take Pearline, if it pleases you--"
912,FITTE THE SECOND.,"Sapolio, if you choose!"
913,FITTE THE SECOND.,
914,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""Take any soap, but take the pup"
915,FITTE THE SECOND.,"And also water take,"
916,FITTE THE SECOND.,And mix the three discreetly up
917,FITTE THE SECOND.,Till they a lather make.
918,FITTE THE SECOND.,
919,FITTE THE SECOND.,"""Then mixing these constituent parts,"
920,FITTE THE SECOND.,"Let nature take her way,"""
921,FITTE THE SECOND.,With such advice that sapient sir
922,FITTE THE SECOND.,Had nothing more to say.
923,FITTE THE SECOND.,
924,FITTE THE SECOND.,Then fared he to his daily toil
925,FITTE THE SECOND.,"All in the Board of Trade,"
926,FITTE THE SECOND.,While Mistress Taylor for that bath
927,FITTE THE SECOND.,Due preparations made.
928,FITTE THE SECOND.,
929,FITTE THE SECOND.,
930,FITTE THE THIRD.,FITTE THE THIRD.
931,FITTE THE THIRD.,
932,FITTE THE THIRD.,She whistled gayly to the pup
933,FITTE THE THIRD.,"And called him by his name,"
934,FITTE THE THIRD.,And presently the guileless thing
935,FITTE THE THIRD.,All unsuspecting came.
936,FITTE THE THIRD.,
937,FITTE THE THIRD.,But when she shut the bath-room door
938,FITTE THE THIRD.,"And caught him as catch-can,"
939,FITTE THE THIRD.,"And dove him in that odious tub,"
940,FITTE THE THIRD.,His sorrows then began.
941,FITTE THE THIRD.,
942,FITTE THE THIRD.,"How did that callow, yellow thing"
943,FITTE THE THIRD.,Regret that April morn--
944,FITTE THE THIRD.,Alas! how bitterly he rued
945,FITTE THE THIRD.,The day that he was born!
946,FITTE THE THIRD.,
947,FITTE THE THIRD.,"Twice and again, but all in vain"
948,FITTE THE THIRD.,He lifted up his wail;
949,FITTE THE THIRD.,"His voice was all the pup could lift,"
950,FITTE THE THIRD.,For thereby hangs this tale.
951,FITTE THE THIRD.,
952,FITTE THE THIRD.,'Twas by that tail she held him down
953,FITTE THE THIRD.,And presently she spread
954,FITTE THE THIRD.,"The creamery lather on his back,"
955,FITTE THE THIRD.,His stomach and his head.
956,FITTE THE THIRD.,
957,FITTE THE THIRD.,"His ears hung down in sorry wise,"
958,FITTE THE THIRD.,"His eyes were, oh! so sad--"
959,FITTE THE THIRD.,He looked as though he just had lost
960,FITTE THE THIRD.,The only friend he had.
961,FITTE THE THIRD.,
962,FITTE THE THIRD.,"And higher yet the water rose,"
963,FITTE THE THIRD.,"The lather still increased,"
964,FITTE THE THIRD.,And sadder still the countenance
965,FITTE THE THIRD.,Of that poor martyred beast!
966,FITTE THE THIRD.,
967,FITTE THE THIRD.,Yet all this time his mistress spoke
968,FITTE THE THIRD.,Such artful words of cheer
969,FITTE THE THIRD.,"As ""Oh, how nice!"" and ""Oh, how clean!"""
970,FITTE THE THIRD.,"And ""There's a patient dear!"""
971,FITTE THE THIRD.,
972,FITTE THE THIRD.,"At last the trial had an end,"
973,FITTE THE THIRD.,At last the pup was free;
974,FITTE THE THIRD.,She threw awide the bath-room door--
975,FITTE THE THIRD.,"""Now get you gone!"" quoth she."
976,FITTE THE THIRD.,
977,FITTE THE THIRD.,
978,FITTE THE FOURTH.,FITTE THE FOURTH.
979,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
980,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Then from that tub and from that room
981,FITTE THE FOURTH.,He gat with vast ado;
982,FITTE THE FOURTH.,At every hop he gave a shake
983,FITTE THE FOURTH.,And--how the water flew!
984,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
985,FITTE THE FOURTH.,He paddled down the winding stairs
986,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"And to the parlor hied,"
987,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Dispensing pools of foamy suds
988,FITTE THE FOURTH.,And slop on every side.
989,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
990,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Upon the carpet then he rolled
991,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"And brushed against the wall,"
992,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"And, horror! whisked his lathery sides"
993,FITTE THE FOURTH.,On overcoat and shawl.
994,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
995,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"Attracted by the dreadful din,"
996,FITTE THE FOURTH.,His mistress came below--
997,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"Who, who can speak her wonderment--"
998,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"Who, who can paint her woe!"
999,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
1000,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Great smears of soap were here and there--
1001,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Her startled vision met
1002,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"With blots of lather everywhere,"
1003,FITTE THE FOURTH.,And everything was wet!
1004,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
1005,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Then Mrs. Taylor gave a shriek
1006,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Like one about to die;
1007,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"""Get out--get out, and don't you dare"
1008,FITTE THE FOURTH.,"Come in till you are dry!"""
1009,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
1010,FITTE THE FOURTH.,With that she opened wide the door
1011,FITTE THE FOURTH.,And waved the critter through;
1012,FITTE THE FOURTH.,Out in the circumambient air
1013,FITTE THE FOURTH.,With grateful yelp he flew.
1014,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
1015,FITTE THE FOURTH.,
1016,FITTE THE FIFTH.,FITTE THE FIFTH.
1017,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1018,FITTE THE FIFTH.,He whisked into the dusty street
1019,FITTE THE FIFTH.,And to the Waller lot
1020,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Where bonny Annie Evans played
1021,FITTE THE FIFTH.,With charming Sissy Knott.
1022,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1023,FITTE THE FIFTH.,And with these pretty little dears
1024,FITTE THE FIFTH.,He mixed himself all up--
1025,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"Oh, fie upon such boisterous play--"
1026,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"Fie, fie, you naughty pup!"
1027,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1028,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"Woe, woe on Annie's India mull,"
1029,FITTE THE FIFTH.,And Sissy's blue percale!
1030,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"One got the pup's belathered flanks,"
1031,FITTE THE FIFTH.,And one his soapy tail!
1032,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1033,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Forth to the rescue of those maids
1034,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Rushed gallant Willie Clow;
1035,FITTE THE FIFTH.,His panties they were white and clean--
1036,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Where are those panties now?
1037,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1038,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Where is the nicely laundered shirt
1039,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"That Kendall Evans wore,"
1040,FITTE THE FIFTH.,And Robbie James' tricot coat
1041,FITTE THE FIFTH.,All buttoned up before?
1042,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1043,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"The leaven, which, as we are told,"
1044,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"Leavens a monstrous lump,"
1045,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Hath far less reaching qualities
1046,FITTE THE FIFTH.,Than a wet pup on the jump.
1047,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1048,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"This way and that he swung and swayed,"
1049,FITTE THE FIFTH.,"He gamboled far and near,"
1050,FITTE THE FIFTH.,And everywhere he thrust himself
1051,FITTE THE FIFTH.,He left a soapy smear.
1052,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1053,FITTE THE FIFTH.,
1054,FITTE THE SIXTH.,FITTE THE SIXTH.
1055,FITTE THE SIXTH.,
1056,FITTE THE SIXTH.,That noon a dozen little dears
1057,FITTE THE SIXTH.,Were spanked and put to bed
1058,FITTE THE SIXTH.,With naught to stay their appetites
1059,FITTE THE SIXTH.,But cheerless crusts of bread.
1060,FITTE THE SIXTH.,
1061,FITTE THE SIXTH.,That noon a dozen hired girls
1062,FITTE THE SIXTH.,Washed out each gown and shirt
1063,FITTE THE SIXTH.,Which that exuberant Taylor pup
1064,FITTE THE SIXTH.,Had frescoed o'er with dirt.
1065,FITTE THE SIXTH.,
1066,FITTE THE SIXTH.,That whole day long the April sun
1067,FITTE THE SIXTH.,Smiled sweetly from above
1068,FITTE THE SIXTH.,On clothes lines flaunting to the breeze
1069,FITTE THE SIXTH.,With emblems mothers love.
1070,FITTE THE SIXTH.,
1071,FITTE THE SIXTH.,That whole day long the Taylor pup

1331,THE TIN BANK.,"Three burglars skilled in arts of sin,"

1333,THE TIN BANK.,And straightway tackled the bank of tin.
1334,THE TIN BANK.,
1335,THE TIN BANK.,"They burgled from half-past ten p.m.,"
1336,THE TIN BANK.,Till the village bell struck four o'clock;

1338,THE TIN BANK.,But the little tin bank would not unlock!
1339,THE TIN BANK.,They couldn't discover the secret spring!

1467,THE PETER-BIRD.,"""Peter!"" and ""Peter!"" all day--calling, reminding and chiding--"
1468,THE PETER-BIRD.,Peter neglected his chores; therefore that outcry for Peter;
1469,THE PETER-BIRD.,Therefore the neighbors allowed evil would surely befall him--
1470,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Yes, on account of these things, ruin would come upon Peter!"
1471,THE PETER-BIRD.,
1472,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Surely enough, on a time, reading and lazing and dreaming"

1478,THE PETER-BIRD.,"She hath been forth in the night, full of her spells and devices,"
1479,THE PETER-BIRD.,Roaming the marshes and dells for heathenish musical nostrums;
1480,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Digging in leaves and at stumps for centipedes, pismires and spiders,"
1481,THE PETER-BIRD.,Grubbing in poisonous pools for hot salmanders and toadstools;
1482,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Charming the bats from the flues, snaring the lizards by twilight,"

1493,THE PETER-BIRD.,Into the fleecy gray pall brooding on hillside and valley.
1494,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Laughing and scoffing, he strode into that hideous vapor;"

1499,THE PETER-BIRD.,And his neglect of his chores hastened this evil condition.
1500,THE PETER-BIRD.,
1501,THE PETER-BIRD.,Out of the woods by the creek cometh a calling for Peter
1502,THE PETER-BIRD.,And from the orchard a voice echoes and echoes it over;
1503,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Down in the pasture the sheep hear that shrill crying for Peter,"
1504,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Up from the spring-house the wail stealeth anon like a whisper,"
1505,THE PETER-BIRD.,Over the meadows that call is aye and forever repeated.
1506,THE PETER-BIRD.,Such are the voices that whooped wildly and vainly for Peter
1507,THE PETER-BIRD.,Decades and decades ago down in the state of Kentucky--
1508,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Such are the voices that cry from the woodland and meadow,"
1509,THE PETER-BIRD.,"""Peter--O Peter!"" all day, calling, reminding, and chiding--"
1510,THE PETER-BIRD.,Taking us back to the time when Peter he done gone and done it!
1511,THE PETER-BIRD.,These are the voices of those left by the boy in the farmhouse
1512,THE PETER-BIRD.,"When, with his laughter and scorn, hatless and bootless and sockless,"
1513,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Clothed in his jeans and his pride, Peter sailed out in the weather,"
1514,THE PETER-BIRD.,Broke from the warmth of his home into that fog of the devil.
1515,THE PETER-BIRD.,Into the smoke of that witch brewing her damnable porridge!
1516,THE PETER-BIRD.,
1517,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Lo, when he vanished from sight, knowing the evil that threatened,"
1518,THE PETER-BIRD.,Forth with importunate cries hastened his father and mother.

1522,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Henhouse and woodpile they passed, calling and wailing and weeping,"
1523,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Through the front gate to the road, braving the hideous vapor--"
1524,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Sought him in lane and on pike, called him in orchard and meadow,"
1525,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Clamoring ""Peter!"" in vain, vainly outcrying for Peter."
1526,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Joining the search came the rest, brothers, and sisters and cousins,"
1527,THE PETER-BIRD.,Venting unspeakable fears in pitiful wailing for Peter!
1528,THE PETER-BIRD.,And from the neighboring farms gathered the men and the women.
1529,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Who, upon hearing the news, swelled the loud chorus for Peter."
1530,THE PETER-BIRD.,
1531,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Farmers and hussifs and maids, bosses and field-hands and niggers,"

1533,THE PETER-BIRD.,"All that had voices to voice, all to those parts appertaining."
1534,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Came to engage in the search, gathered and bellowed for Peter."

1544,THE PETER-BIRD.,Now surged from their prosperous homes to join in the hunt for the
1545,THE PETER-BIRD.,truant.
1546,THE PETER-BIRD.,"To ascertain where he was at, to help out the chorus for Peter."
1547,THE PETER-BIRD.,
1548,THE PETER-BIRD.,Still on these prosperous farms were heirs and assigns of the people

1550,THE PETER-BIRD.,Still on these farms shall you hear (and still on the turnpikes adjacent)
1551,THE PETER-BIRD.,"That pitiful, petulant call, that pleading, expostulant wailing,"
1552,THE PETER-BIRD.,"That hopeless, monotonous moan, that crooning and droning for Peter."
1553,THE PETER-BIRD.,Some say the witch in her wrath transmogrified all those good people;
1554,THE PETER-BIRD.,"That, wakened from slumber that day by the calling and bawling for Peter,"
1555,THE PETER-BIRD.,"She out of her cave in a trice, and, waving the foot of a rabbit"

1564,THE PETER-BIRD.,
1565,THE PETER-BIRD.,This is the story they tell; so in good sooth saith the legend:

1567,THE PETER-BIRD.,"That it is true I believe, for on the breeze of the morning"
1568,THE PETER-BIRD.,Come the shrill voices of birds calling and calling for Peter;
1569,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Out of the maple and beech glitter the eyes of the wailers,"
1570,THE PETER-BIRD.,Peeping and peering for him who formerly lived in these places--
1571,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Peter, the heretic lad, lazy and careless and dreaming,"
1572,THE PETER-BIRD.,Sorely afflicted with books and with pubescent paresis.
1573,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Hating the things of the farm, care of the barn and the garden."
1574,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Always neglecting his chores--given to books and to reading,"

1578,THE PETER-BIRD.,This is the legend of yore told in the state of Kentucky
1579,THE PETER-BIRD.,"When in the springtime the birds call from the beeches and maples,"
1580,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Call from the petulant thorn, call from the acrid persimmon;"
1581,THE PETER-BIRD.,"When from the woods by the creek and from the pastures and meadows,"

1583,THE PETER-BIRD.,"When from the redbud and gum and from redolent lilac,"
1584,THE PETER-BIRD.,When from the dirt roads and pikes comes that calling for Peter;
1585,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Cometh the dolorous cry, cometh that weird iteration"
1586,THE PETER-BIRD.,"Of ""Peter"" and ""Peter"" for aye, of ""Peter"" and ""Peter"" forever!"
1587,THE PETER-BIRD.,"This is the legend of old, told in the tumtitty meter"
