91,A VOICE ON THE WIND,A VOICE ON THE WIND
92,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
93,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
94,A VOICE ON THE WIND,She walks with the wind on the windy height
95,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"When the rocks are loud and the waves are white,"
96,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"And all night long she calls through the night,"
97,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home!"""
98,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Her bleak gown, torn as a tattered cloud,"
99,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Tosses around her like a shroud,"
100,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"While over the deep her voice rings loud,--"
101,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home, come home!"
102,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"O, my children, come home!"""
103,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
104,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Who is she who wanders alone,"
105,A VOICE ON THE WIND,When the wind drives sheer and the rain is blown?
106,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Who walks all night and makes her moan,"
107,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home!"""
108,A VOICE ON THE WIND,Whose face is raised to the blinding gale;
109,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Whose hair blows black and whose eyes are pale,"
110,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"While over the world is heard her wail,--"
111,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home, come home!"
112,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"O, my children, come home!"""
113,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
114,A VOICE ON THE WIND,She walks with the wind in the windy wood;
115,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"The sad rain drips from her hair and hood,"
116,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"And her cry sobs by, like a ghost pursued,"
117,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home!"""
118,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
119,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Where the trees are gaunt and the rocks are drear,"
120,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"The owl and the fox crouch down in fear,"
121,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"While wild through the wood her voice they hear,--"
122,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home, come home!"
123,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"O, my children, come home!"""
124,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
125,A VOICE ON THE WIND,Who is she who shudders by
126,A VOICE ON THE WIND,When the boughs blow bare and the dead leaves fly?
127,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Who walks all night with her wailing cry,"
128,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home!"""
129,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Who, strange of look, and wild of tongue,"
130,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"With pale feet wounded and hands wan-wrung,"
131,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Sweeps on and on with her cry, far-flung,--"
132,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home, come home!"
133,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"O, my children, come home!"""
134,A VOICE ON THE WIND,
135,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"'Tis the Spirit of Autumn, no man sees,"
136,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"The mother of Death and Mysteries,"
137,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Who cries on the wind all night to these,"
138,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home!"""
139,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"The Spirit of Autumn, pierced with pain,"
140,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Calling her children home again,"
141,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"Death and Dreams, through ruin and rain,"
142,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"""O, my children, come home, come home!"
143,A VOICE ON THE WIND,"O, my children, come home!"""

148,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE
149,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
150,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
151,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Do you know the way that goes
152,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Over fields of rue and rose,--"
153,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Warm of scent and hot of hue,"
154,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Roofed with heaven's bluest blue,--"
155,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,To the Vale of Dreams Come True?
156,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
157,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Do you know the path that twines,"
158,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Banked with elder-bosks and vines,"
159,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Under boughs that shade a stream,"
160,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Hurrying, crystal as a gleam,"
161,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,To the Hills of Love a-Dream?
162,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
163,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Tell me, tell me, have you gone"
164,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Through the fields and woods of dawn,"
165,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Meadowlands and trees that roll,"
166,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Great of grass and huge of bole,"
167,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,To the Land of Hearts Made Whole?
168,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
169,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"On the way, among the fields,"
170,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Poppies lift vermilion shields,"
171,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"In whose hearts the golden Noon,"
172,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Murmuring her drowsy tune,"
173,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Rocks the sleepy bees that croon.
174,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
175,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"On the way, amid the woods,"
176,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Mandrakes muster multitudes,"
177,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"'Mid whose blossoms, white as tusk,"
178,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Glides the glimmering Forest-Dusk,"
179,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,With her fluttering moths of musk.
180,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
181,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Here you hear the stealthy stir
182,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Of shy lives of hoof and fur;
183,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Harmless things that hide and peer,"
184,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Hearts that sucked the milk of fear--
185,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Fox and rabbit, squirrel and deer."
186,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
187,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Here you see the mossy flight
188,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Of faint forms that love the night--
189,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Whippoorwill- and owlet-things,"
190,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Whose far call before you brings
191,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Wonder-worlds of happenings.
192,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
193,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Now in sunlight, now in shade,"
194,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Water, like a brandished blade,"
195,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Foaming forward, wild of flight,"
196,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Startles then arrests the sight,"
197,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Whirling steely loops of light.
198,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
199,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Thro' the tree-tops, down the vale,"
200,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Breezes pass and leave a trail
201,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Of cool music that the birds,"
202,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Following in happy herds,"
203,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Gather up in twittering words.
204,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
205,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Blossoms, frail and manifold,"
206,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Strew the way with pearl and gold;
207,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Blurs, that seem the darling print"
208,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Of the Springtime's feet, or glint"
209,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Of her twinkling gown's torn tint.
210,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
211,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,There the myths of old endure:
212,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Dreams that are the world-soul's cure;
213,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Things that have no place or play
214,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,In the facts of Everyday
215,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,'Round your presence smile and sway.
216,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
217,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Suddenly your eyes may see,"
218,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Stepping softly from her tree,"
219,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Slim of form and wet with dew,"
220,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,The brown dryad; lips the hue
221,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Of a berry bit into.
222,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
223,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,You may mark the naiad rise
224,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,From her pool's reflected skies;
225,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"In her gaze the heaven that dreams,"
226,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Starred, in twilight-haunted streams,"
227,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Mixed with water's grayer gleams.
228,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
229,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"You may see the laurel's girth,"
230,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Big of bloom, give fragrant birth"
231,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"To the oread whose hair,"
232,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Musk and darkness, light and air,"
233,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Fills the hush with wonder there.
234,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
235,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"You may mark the rocks divide,"
236,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"And the faun before you glide,"
237,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Piping on a magic reed,"
238,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Sowing many a music seed,"
239,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,From which bloom and mushroom bead.
240,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
241,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Of the rain and sunlight born,"
242,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Young of beard and young of horn,"
243,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"You may see the satyr lie,"
244,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"With a very knowing eye,"
245,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Teaching youngling birds to fly.
246,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
247,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,These shall cheer and follow you
248,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Through the Vale of Dreams Come True;
249,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Wind-like voices, leaf-like feet;"
250,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Forms of mist and hazy heat,"
251,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,In whose pulses sunbeams beat.
252,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
253,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Lo! you tread enchanted ground!
254,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,From the hollows all around
255,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Elf and spirit, gnome and fay,"
256,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Guide your feet along the way
257,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Till the dewy close of day.
258,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
259,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Then beside you, jet on jet,"
260,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Emerald-hued or violet,"
261,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Flickering swings a firefly light,"
262,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Aye to guide your steps a-right
263,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,From the valley to the height.
264,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
265,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Steep the way is; when at last
266,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Vale and wood and stream are passed,"
267,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,From the heights you shall behold
268,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Panther heavens of spotted gold
269,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Tiger-tawny deeps unfold.
270,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
271,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,You shall see on stocks and stones
272,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Sunset's bell-deep color tones
273,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Fallen; and the valleys filled
274,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"With dusk's purple music, spilled"
275,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,On the silence rapture-thrilled.
276,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
277,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Then, as answering bell greets bell,"
278,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Night ring in her miracle
279,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Of the doméd dark, o'er-rolled,"
280,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"Note on note, with starlight cold,"
281,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,'Twixt the moon's broad peal of gold.
282,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,
283,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,On the hill-top Love-a-Dream
284,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Shows you then her window-gleam;
285,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,Brings you home and folds your soul
286,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,"In the peace of vale and knoll,"
287,THE LAND OF HEARTS MADE WHOLE,In the Land of Hearts Made Whole.

292,THE WIND OF WINTER,THE WIND OF WINTER
293,THE WIND OF WINTER,
294,THE WIND OF WINTER,
295,THE WIND OF WINTER,"The Winter Wind, the wind of death,"
296,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Who knocked upon my door,"
297,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Now through the key-hole entereth,"
298,THE WIND OF WINTER,Invisible and hoar;
299,THE WIND OF WINTER,He breathes around his icy breath
300,THE WIND OF WINTER,And treads the flickering floor.
301,THE WIND OF WINTER,
302,THE WIND OF WINTER,"I heard him, wandering in the night,"
303,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Tap at my window pane,"
304,THE WIND OF WINTER,"With ghostly fingers, snowy white,"
305,THE WIND OF WINTER,"I heard him tug in vain,"
306,THE WIND OF WINTER,Until the shuddering candle-light
307,THE WIND OF WINTER,With fear did cringe and strain.
308,THE WIND OF WINTER,
309,THE WIND OF WINTER,"The fire, awakened by his voice,"
310,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Leapt up with frantic arms,"
311,THE WIND OF WINTER,Like some wild babe that greets with noise
312,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Its father home who storms,"
313,THE WIND OF WINTER,With rosy gestures that rejoice
314,THE WIND OF WINTER,And crimson kiss that warms.
315,THE WIND OF WINTER,
316,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Now in the hearth he sits and, drowned"
317,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Among the ashes, blows;"
318,THE WIND OF WINTER,Or through the room goes stealing 'round
319,THE WIND OF WINTER,"On cautious-stepping toes,"
320,THE WIND OF WINTER,Deep mantled in the drowsy sound
321,THE WIND OF WINTER,Of night that sleets and snows.
322,THE WIND OF WINTER,
323,THE WIND OF WINTER,"And oft, like some thin fairy-thing,"
324,THE WIND OF WINTER,"The stormy hush amid,"
325,THE WIND OF WINTER,I hear his captive trebles ring
326,THE WIND OF WINTER,Beneath the kettle's lid;
327,THE WIND OF WINTER,Or now a harp of elfland string
328,THE WIND OF WINTER,In some dark cranny hid.
329,THE WIND OF WINTER,
330,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Again I hear him, imp-like, whine"
331,THE WIND OF WINTER,Cramped in the gusty flue;
332,THE WIND OF WINTER,Or knotted in the resinous pine
333,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Raise goblin cry and hue,"
334,THE WIND OF WINTER,"While through the smoke his eyeballs shine,"
335,THE WIND OF WINTER,A sooty red and blue.
336,THE WIND OF WINTER,
337,THE WIND OF WINTER,"At last I hear him, nearing dawn,"
338,THE WIND OF WINTER,"Take up his roaring broom,"
339,THE WIND OF WINTER,"And sweep wild leaves from wood and lawn,"
340,THE WIND OF WINTER,"And from the heavens the gloom,"
341,THE WIND OF WINTER,"To show the gaunt world lying wan,"
342,THE WIND OF WINTER,And morn's cold rose a-bloom.
343,THE WIND OF WINTER,
344,THE WIND OF WINTER,
345,THE WIND OF WINTER,
346,THE WIND OF WINTER,
347,THE WIND OF SUMMER,THE WIND OF SUMMER
348,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
349,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
350,THE WIND OF SUMMER,From the hills and far away
351,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"All the long, warm summer day"
352,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Comes the wind and seems to say:
353,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
354,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""Come, oh, come! and let us go"
355,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Where the meadows bend and blow,"
356,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Waving with the white-tops' snow.
357,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
358,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""'Neath the hyssop-colored sky"
359,THE WIND OF SUMMER,'Mid the meadows we will lie
360,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Watching the white clouds roll by;
361,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
362,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""While your hair my hands shall press"
363,THE WIND OF SUMMER,With a cooling tenderness
364,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your grief grows less and less.
365,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
366,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""Come, oh, come! and let us roam"
367,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Where the rock-cut waters comb
368,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Flowing crystal into foam.
369,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
370,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""Under trees whose trunks are brown,"
371,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"On the banks that violets crown,"
372,THE WIND OF SUMMER,We will watch the fish flash down;
373,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
374,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""While your ear my voice shall soothe"
375,THE WIND OF SUMMER,With a whisper soft and smooth
376,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your care shall wax uncouth.
377,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
378,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""Come! where forests, line on line,"
379,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Armies of the oak and pine,"
380,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Scale the hills and shout and shine.
381,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
382,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""We will wander, hand in hand,"
383,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Ways where tall the toadstools stand,"
384,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Mile-stones white of Fairyland.
385,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
386,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""While your eyes my lips shall kiss,"
387,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Dewy as a wild rose is,"
388,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till they gaze on naught but bliss.
389,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
390,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""On the meadows you will hear,"
391,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Leaning low your spirit ear,"
392,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Cautious footsteps drawing near.
393,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
394,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""You will deem it but a bee,"
395,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Murmuring soft and sleepily,"
396,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your inner sight shall see
397,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
398,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""'Tis a presence passing slow,"
399,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"All its shining hair ablow,"
400,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Through the white-tops' tossing snow.
401,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
402,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""By the waters, if you will,"
403,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"And your inmost soul be still,"
404,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Melody your ears shall fill.
405,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
406,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""You will deem it but the stream"
407,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Rippling onward in a dream,"
408,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till upon your gaze shall gleam
409,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
410,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""Arm of spray and throat of foam--"
411,THE WIND OF SUMMER,'Tis a spirit there aroam
412,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Where the radiant waters comb.
413,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
414,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""In the forest, if you heed,"
415,THE WIND OF SUMMER,You shall hear a magic reed
416,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Sow sweet notes like silver seed.
417,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
418,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""You will deem your ears have heard"
419,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Stir of tree or song of bird,"
420,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Till your startled eyes are blurred
421,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
422,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""By a vision, instant seen,"
423,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"Naked gold and beryl green,"
424,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Glimmering bright the boughs between.
425,THE WIND OF SUMMER,
426,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"""Follow me! and you shall see"
427,THE WIND OF SUMMER,Wonder-worlds of mystery
428,THE WIND OF SUMMER,"That are only known to me!"""

911,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Her shawl, the lace-like elder bloom,"
912,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"She hangs upon the hillside brake,"
913,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Smelling of warmth and of her breast's perfume,"
914,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"And, lying in the citron-colored gloom"
915,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Beside the lilied lake,"
916,SUMMER NOONTIDE,She stares the buds awake.
917,SUMMER NOONTIDE,
918,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Or, with a smile, through watery deeps"
919,SUMMER NOONTIDE,She leads the oaring turtle's legs;
920,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Or guides the crimson fish, that swims and sleeps,"
921,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"From pad to pad, from which the young frog leaps;"
922,SUMMER NOONTIDE,And to its nest's green eggs
923,SUMMER NOONTIDE,The bird that pleads and begs.
924,SUMMER NOONTIDE,
925,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Then 'mid the fields of unmown hay
926,SUMMER NOONTIDE,She shows the bees where sweets are found;
927,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"And points the butterflies, at airy play,"
928,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"And dragonflies, along the water-way,"
929,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Where honeyed flowers abound
930,SUMMER NOONTIDE,For them to flicker 'round.
931,SUMMER NOONTIDE,
932,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Or where ripe apples pelt with gold
933,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Some barn--around which, coned with snow,"
934,SUMMER NOONTIDE,The wild-potato blooms--she mounts its old
935,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Mossed roof, and through warped sides, the knots have holed,"
936,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Lets her long glances glow
937,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Into the loft below.
938,SUMMER NOONTIDE,
939,SUMMER NOONTIDE,To show the mud-wasp at its cell
940,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Slenderly busy; swallows, too,"
941,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Packing against a beam their nest's clay shell;
942,SUMMER NOONTIDE,And crouching in the dark the owl as well
943,SUMMER NOONTIDE,With all her downy crew
944,SUMMER NOONTIDE,Of owlets gray of hue.
945,SUMMER NOONTIDE,
946,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"These are her joys, and until dusk"
947,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Lounging she walks where reapers reap,"
948,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"From sultry raiment shaking scents of musk,"
949,SUMMER NOONTIDE,"Rustling the corn within its silken husk,"
950,SUMMER NOONTIDE,And driving down heav'n's deep

1386,III,A spot for dreaming:
1387,III,A spot for Oreads
1388,III,"To smooth their nut-brown braids,"

2128,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","I, who am rather fond of dealing in it, never feel quite safe. Not only"
2129,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","is it questionable at the moment, but the later behavior of the author"

2131,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","always with a shrinking, which I try to hide from the public, that I"

2133,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","is a joy when I find that I have not lost my wager, which is full"
2134,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",compensation for the anxiety suffered. This joy has lately been mine in
2135,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","the latest little book of Mr. Madison Cawein, whose work I long ago"
2136,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",confessed my pleasure in. I am not sure that he has transcended the
2137,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","limits which he then seemed to give himself as the lover, the prophet,"
2138,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",of beauty in the woods and waters and skies of the southern Mid-West. I
2139,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",do not know that he need have done more than unlock the riches of
2140,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",emotion within these limits. What I am sure of is that in 'Weeds by the
2141,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",Wall' he has more deeply charmed me with an art perfected from that I
2142,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",felt in 'Blooms of the Berry' ten or fifteen years since. Many little
2143,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",books of his have come (I hope not also gone) between the first and
2144,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","last, and none of them has failed to make me glad of his work; and now,"

2147,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","within the time since Mr. Cawein began to write as his are, or from such"
2148,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",an intimacy with the 'various language' which nature speaks. There are
2149,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","other good poems in the book, poems which would have made reputes in the"
2150,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","eighteenth century, and which it would be a shame not to own good in the"
2151,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","twentieth; but those which speak for 'The Cricket,' 'A Twilight Moth,'"

2153,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","'Drouth,' 'Before the Rain,' and the like, are in a voice which"
2154,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","interprets the very soul of what we call the inarticulate things, though"
2155,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",they seem to have enunciated themselves so distinctly to this poet. It
2156,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",is cheap to note his increasing control of his affluent imagery and the
2157,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",growing mastery that makes him so fine an artist. These things were to
2158,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","be expected from his early poems, but what makes one think he will go"
2159,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","far and long, and outlive both praise and blame, is the blending of a"
2160,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.",sense of the Kentucky civilization in such a poem as 'Feud.'...

2165,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY.","such a way as this lies Mr. Cawein's hope of rise from nature up to man,"
