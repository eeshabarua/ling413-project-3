41,THE SOWERS,
42,THE SOWERS,_Written for the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Founding of St. Lawrence
43,THE SOWERS,University_
44,THE SOWERS,
45,THE SOWERS,
46,THE SOWERS,"I know the hills that lift the distant plain,"
47,THE SOWERS,
48,THE SOWERS,"The college hall--the spirit of its throngs,"
49,THE SOWERS,
50,THE SOWERS,"The meadows and the waving fields of grain,"
51,THE SOWERS,
52,THE SOWERS,Full well I know their colors and their songs.
53,THE SOWERS,
54,THE SOWERS,"I know the storied gates where love was told,"
55,THE SOWERS,
56,THE SOWERS,"The grove where walked the muses and the seers,"
57,THE SOWERS,
58,THE SOWERS,"The river, dark or touched with light of gold,"
59,THE SOWERS,
60,THE SOWERS,"Or slow, or swift so like the flowing years."
61,THE SOWERS,
62,THE SOWERS,I know not these who sadly sit them down
63,THE SOWERS,
64,THE SOWERS,And while the night in half-forgotten days;
65,THE SOWERS,
66,THE SOWERS,I know not these who wear the hoary crown
67,THE SOWERS,
68,THE SOWERS,And find a pathos in the merry lays.
69,THE SOWERS,
70,THE SOWERS,"Here Memory, with old wisdom on her lips,"
71,THE SOWERS,
72,THE SOWERS,A finger points at each familiar name--
73,THE SOWERS,
74,THE SOWERS,"Some writ on water, stone or stranded ships,"
75,THE SOWERS,
76,THE SOWERS,Some in the music of the trump of fame.
77,THE SOWERS,
78,THE SOWERS,"Here oft, I think, beloved voices call"
79,THE SOWERS,
80,THE SOWERS,Behind a weathered door 'neath ancient trees.
81,THE SOWERS,
82,THE SOWERS,"I hear sad echoes in the empty hall,"
83,THE SOWERS,
84,THE SOWERS,The wide world's lyric in the harping breeze.
85,THE SOWERS,
86,THE SOWERS,"It sings of them I loved and left of old,"
87,THE SOWERS,
88,THE SOWERS,Of my fond hope to bring a worthy prize--
89,THE SOWERS,
90,THE SOWERS,"Some well-earned token, better far than gold,"
91,THE SOWERS,
92,THE SOWERS,And lay it humbly down before their eyes.
93,THE SOWERS,
94,THE SOWERS,"And tell them it were rightly theirs--not mine,"
95,THE SOWERS,
96,THE SOWERS,An harvest come of their own word and deed;
97,THE SOWERS,
98,THE SOWERS,I strove with tares that threatened my design
99,THE SOWERS,
100,THE SOWERS,To make the crop as noble as the seed.
101,THE SOWERS,
102,THE SOWERS,So they might see it paid--that life they knew--
103,THE SOWERS,
104,THE SOWERS,"A toilsome web and knit of many a skein,"
105,THE SOWERS,
106,THE SOWERS,"With love's sweet sacrifice all woven through,"
107,THE SOWERS,
108,THE SOWERS,And broken threads of hope and joy and pain.
109,THE SOWERS,
110,THE SOWERS,"On root-bound acres, pent with rocks and stones,"
111,THE SOWERS,
112,THE SOWERS,Their hope of wealth and leisure slowly died.
113,THE SOWERS,
114,THE SOWERS,They gave their strength in toil that racked their
115,THE SOWERS,"bones,"
116,THE SOWERS,
117,THE SOWERS,"They gave their youth, their beauty, and their pride."
118,THE SOWERS,
119,THE SOWERS,Ere Nature's last defence had been withdrawn
120,THE SOWERS,
121,THE SOWERS,That those they loved might have what they could
122,THE SOWERS,not--
123,THE SOWERS,
124,THE SOWERS,The power of learning wedded to their brawn
125,THE SOWERS,
126,THE SOWERS,And to the simple virtue there begot.
127,THE SOWERS,
128,THE SOWERS,My college! Once--it was a day of old--
129,THE SOWERS,
130,THE SOWERS,I saw thy panes aglow with sunset fire
131,THE SOWERS,
132,THE SOWERS,And heard the story of thy purpose told
133,THE SOWERS,
134,THE SOWERS,And felt the tide of infinite desire.
135,THE SOWERS,
136,THE SOWERS,In thee I saw the gates of mystery
137,THE SOWERS,
138,THE SOWERS,"That led to dream-lit, vast, inviting lands--"
139,THE SOWERS,
140,THE SOWERS,Far backward to the bourne of history
141,THE SOWERS,
142,THE SOWERS,And forward to the House not made with hands.
143,THE SOWERS,
144,THE SOWERS,You gave the husbandman a richer yield
145,THE SOWERS,
146,THE SOWERS,Than any that his granary may hold;
147,THE SOWERS,
148,THE SOWERS,"You called his children from the shop and field,"
149,THE SOWERS,
150,THE SOWERS,Taught them to sow and reap an undredfold.
151,THE SOWERS,
152,THE SOWERS,"To sow the seed of truth and hope and peace,"
153,THE SOWERS,
154,THE SOWERS,And take the root of error from the sod;
155,THE SOWERS,
156,THE SOWERS,"To be of those who make the sure increase,"
157,THE SOWERS,
158,THE SOWERS,"Forever growing, in the lands of God."
159,THE SOWERS,
160,THE SOWERS,

190,THE NEW WORLD,Homeric dreams.
191,THE NEW WORLD,
192,THE NEW WORLD,"Zeus, with thought to load the fulmen gathered for"

213,THE NEW WORLD,of Hercules.
214,THE NEW WORLD,
215,THE NEW WORLD,"Eyes of man, forever reaching where immensity"

245,THE NEW WORLD,"Justice, keen-eyed, Saxon-hearted, scans the records"

281,FAITH,_Being some words of counsel from an old Yankee to his son Bill when the
282,FAITH,latter is about to enter college._
283,FAITH,
284,FAITH,
285,FAITH,"Faith, Bill? You remember how ye used to wake"
286,FAITH,"an' cry,"
287,FAITH,
288,FAITH,An' when I lit a candle how the bugaboos 'u'd fly?
289,FAITH,
290,FAITH,"Well, faith is like a father in the dark of every"
291,FAITH,night--
292,FAITH,
293,FAITH,"It tells ye not t' be afraid, an' mebbe strikes a"
294,FAITH,light.
295,FAITH,
296,FAITH,"Now, don't expect too much o' God, it wouldn't"
297,FAITH,be quite fair
298,FAITH,
299,FAITH,If fer anything ye wanted ye could only swap a
300,FAITH,prayer;
301,FAITH,
302,FAITH,"I'd pray fer yours, an' you fer mine, an' Deacon"
303,FAITH,"Henry Hospur,"
304,FAITH,
305,FAITH,He wouldn't hev a thing t' do but lay abed an'
306,FAITH,prosper.

308,FAITH,"If all things come so easy, Bill, they'd hev but little"
309,FAITH,"worth,"
310,FAITH,
311,FAITH,An' some one with a gift o' prayer 'u'd mebbe own
312,FAITH,the earth.
313,FAITH,
314,FAITH,It's the toil ye give t' git a thing--the sweat an'
315,FAITH,blood an' care--
316,FAITH,
317,FAITH,That makes the kind o' argument that ought to
318,FAITH,back yer prayer.
319,FAITH,
320,FAITH,Fer the record o' yer doin'--I believe the soul is
321,FAITH,planned
322,FAITH,
323,FAITH,With some self-workin' register t' tell jest how ye
324,FAITH,stand.
325,FAITH,
326,FAITH,"An' it won't take any cipherin' t' show, that"
327,FAITH,"fearful day,"
328,FAITH,
329,FAITH,"If ye've multiplied yer talents well, er thrown 'em"
330,FAITH,all away.
331,FAITH,
332,FAITH,"When yer feet are on the summit, an' the wide"
333,FAITH,"horizon clears,"
334,FAITH,
335,FAITH,An' ye look back on yer pathway windin' thro' the
336,FAITH,vale o' tears;
337,FAITH,
338,FAITH,"When ye see how much ye've trespassed, an' how"
339,FAITH,"fur ye've gone astray,"
340,FAITH,
341,FAITH,Ye'll know the way o' Providence ain't apt t' be
342,FAITH,_your_ way.
343,FAITH,
344,FAITH,"God knows as much as can be known, but I don't"
345,FAITH,think it's true.
346,FAITH,
347,FAITH,He knows of all the dangers in the path o' me an'
348,FAITH,you.
349,FAITH,
350,FAITH,If I shet my eyes an' hurl a stun that kills--the
351,FAITH,"King o' Siam,"
352,FAITH,
353,FAITH,The chances are that God 'll be as much surprised
354,FAITH,as I am.
355,FAITH,
356,FAITH,"If ye pray with faith _believin'_, why, ye'll certainly"
357,FAITH,"receive,"
358,FAITH,
359,FAITH,But that God 'll break His own good law is more 'n
360,FAITH,I'll believe.
361,FAITH,
362,FAITH,"If it grieves Him when a sparrow falls, it's sure as"
363,FAITH,"anything,"
364,FAITH,
365,FAITH,"He'd hev turned the arrow, if He could, that broke"
366,FAITH,the sparrow's wing.

368,FAITH,Ye can read old Nature's history that's writ in rocks

370,FAITH,
371,FAITH,Ye can see her throbbin' vitals an' her mighty rack
372,FAITH,"o' bones,"
373,FAITH,
374,FAITH,"But the soul o' her--the livin' God, a little child"
375,FAITH,may know
376,FAITH,
377,FAITH,No lens er rule o' cipherin' can ever hope t' show.
378,FAITH,
379,FAITH,There's a part o' God's creation very handy t' yer
380,FAITH,"view,"
381,FAITH,
382,FAITH,"All the truth o' life is in it an' remember, Bill, it's"
383,FAITH,_you_.
384,FAITH,
385,FAITH,An' after all yer science ye must look up in yer
386,FAITH,mind
387,FAITH,
388,FAITH,An' learn its own astronomy the star o' peace t' find.
389,FAITH,
390,FAITH,There's good old Aunt Samanthy Jane that all her
391,FAITH,journey long
392,FAITH,
393,FAITH,Has led her heart to labor with a reveille of song.
394,FAITH,
395,FAITH,"Her folks hev robbed an' left her, but her faith in"
396,FAITH,goodness grows;
397,FAITH,
398,FAITH,"She hasn't any larnin', but I tell ye, Bill, _she_ knows!"
399,FAITH,
400,FAITH,She's hed her share o' troubles; I remember well
401,FAITH,the day
402,FAITH,
403,FAITH,We took her t' the poor-house--she was singin' all
404,FAITH,the way.
405,FAITH,
406,FAITH,Ye needn't be afraid t' come where stormy Jordan
407,FAITH,"flows,"
408,FAITH,
409,FAITH,If all the l'arnin' ye can git has taught ye half _she_

411,FAITH,

930,THE BABY CORPS,_Being some account of the little cadets of the Virginia Military
931,THE BABY CORPS,"Institute, who stood the examination of war at New Market, Va. May 15,"
932,THE BABY CORPS,"1864, in the front line of the Confederate forces, where more than three"
933,THE BABY CORPS,hundred answered to their names and all were perfect._
934,THE BABY CORPS,
935,THE BABY CORPS,
936,THE BABY CORPS,We were only a lot of little boys--they called us a
937,THE BABY CORPS,baby corps--
938,THE BABY CORPS,
939,THE BABY CORPS,At the Institute in Lexington in the winter
940,THE BABY CORPS,of '64;
941,THE BABY CORPS,
942,THE BABY CORPS,And the New Year brought to the stricken South
943,THE BABY CORPS,"no end of the war in sight,"
944,THE BABY CORPS,
945,THE BABY CORPS,But we thought we could whip the North in a week
946,THE BABY CORPS,if they'd only let us fight.
947,THE BABY CORPS,
948,THE BABY CORPS,One night when the boys were all abed we heard
949,THE BABY CORPS,"the long roll beat,"
950,THE BABY CORPS,
951,THE BABY CORPS,And quickly the walls of the building shook with
952,THE BABY CORPS,the tread of hurrying feet;
953,THE BABY CORPS,
954,THE BABY CORPS,And when the battalion stood in line we heard the
955,THE BABY CORPS,welcome warning:
956,THE BABY CORPS,
957,THE BABY CORPS,"""Breckinridge needs the help o' the corps; be"
958,THE BABY CORPS,"ready to march in the morning."""
959,THE BABY CORPS,
960,THE BABY CORPS,"And many a boastful tale was told, through the"
961,THE BABY CORPS,"lingering hours of night,"
962,THE BABY CORPS,
963,THE BABY CORPS,And the teller fenced with airy foes and showed
964,THE BABY CORPS,how heroes fight.
965,THE BABY CORPS,
966,THE BABY CORPS,And notes of love were written with many a fevered
967,THE BABY CORPS,"sigh,"
968,THE BABY CORPS,
969,THE BABY CORPS,That breathed the solemn sacrifice of those about
970,THE BABY CORPS,to die.
971,THE BABY CORPS,
972,THE BABY CORPS,Some sat in nature's uniform patching their suits
973,THE BABY CORPS,"of gray,"
974,THE BABY CORPS,
975,THE BABY CORPS,And some stood squinting across their guns in a
976,THE BABY CORPS,darkly suggestive way.
977,THE BABY CORPS,
978,THE BABY CORPS,The battalion was off on the Staunton pike as soon
979,THE BABY CORPS,"as the sun had risen,"
980,THE BABY CORPS,
981,THE BABY CORPS,"And we turned and cheered for the Institute, but"
982,THE BABY CORPS,yesterday a prison.
983,THE BABY CORPS,
984,THE BABY CORPS,"At Staunton the soldiers chaffed us, and the girls"
985,THE BABY CORPS,of the city schools
986,THE BABY CORPS,
987,THE BABY CORPS,Giggled and flirted around the corps till we felt like
988,THE BABY CORPS,a lot of fools;
989,THE BABY CORPS,
990,THE BABY CORPS,They threw us kisses and tiny drums and a volley
991,THE BABY CORPS,"of baby rattles,"
992,THE BABY CORPS,
993,THE BABY CORPS,'Til we thought that the fire of ridicule was worse
994,THE BABY CORPS,than the fire of battles.
995,THE BABY CORPS,
996,THE BABY CORPS,"We made our escape in the early dawn, and, camping"
997,THE BABY CORPS,"the second night,"

1001,THE BABY CORPS,
1002,THE BABY CORPS,"And the troopers who met us, riding fast from the"
1003,THE BABY CORPS,"thick of the army hives,"
1004,THE BABY CORPS,
1005,THE BABY CORPS,"Said: ""Sigel has come with an awful force, and"
1006,THE BABY CORPS,"ye'll have to fight fer yer lives."""

1009,THE BABY CORPS,"weakened our young desires,"
1010,THE BABY CORPS,
1011,THE BABY CORPS,And the third day out we camped at dusk in sight
1012,THE BABY CORPS,of the picket fires;
1013,THE BABY CORPS,
1014,THE BABY CORPS,"Our thoughts, wing-weary with homeward flight,"
1015,THE BABY CORPS,"went astray in the gloomy skies,"
1016,THE BABY CORPS,
1017,THE BABY CORPS,And our hearts were beating a reveille whenever
1018,THE BABY CORPS,we closed our eyes.
1019,THE BABY CORPS,
1020,THE BABY CORPS,"""Hark! what's that? The sentry call?"" (A"

1024,THE BABY CORPS,"Don't ye hear 'em a-thumpin' the drums?"""
1025,THE BABY CORPS,
1026,THE BABY CORPS,"Said the captain, who sat in the light of the fire"
1027,THE BABY CORPS,tying his muddy shoes:
1028,THE BABY CORPS,
1029,THE BABY CORPS,"""We must toe the line of the Yankees soon, an'"
1030,THE BABY CORPS,we haven't much time to lose.
1031,THE BABY CORPS,
1032,THE BABY CORPS,"""Hats off!"" And we all stood silent while the"
1033,THE BABY CORPS,captain raised his hand
1034,THE BABY CORPS,
1035,THE BABY CORPS,"And prayed, imploring the God of war to favor"
1036,THE BABY CORPS,his little band.
1037,THE BABY CORPS,
1038,THE BABY CORPS,"His voice went out in a whisper at last, and then"
1039,THE BABY CORPS,without further remark
1040,THE BABY CORPS,
1041,THE BABY CORPS,"He bade the battalion form in fours, and led us"
1042,THE BABY CORPS,away in the dark.
1043,THE BABY CORPS,
1044,THE BABY CORPS,We lamed our legs on the heavy road and a long
1045,THE BABY CORPS,rain cooled our blood
1046,THE BABY CORPS,
1047,THE BABY CORPS,And every time we raised a foot we could hear the
1048,THE BABY CORPS,suck of the mud.
1049,THE BABY CORPS,
1050,THE BABY CORPS,At noon we came--a weary lot--to the top of a
1051,THE BABY CORPS,"big clay hill,"
1052,THE BABY CORPS,
1053,THE BABY CORPS,And below were miles of infantry--the whole bunch
1054,THE BABY CORPS,standing still.
1055,THE BABY CORPS,
1056,THE BABY CORPS,"The league-long hills are striped with blue, the"

1058,THE BABY CORPS,
1059,THE BABY CORPS,And between the armies of North and South are
1060,THE BABY CORPS,blossoming fields of May.
1061,THE BABY CORPS,
1062,THE BABY CORPS,"There's a mighty cheer in the Southern host as,"
1063,THE BABY CORPS,"led by the fife and drum,"
1064,THE BABY CORPS,
1065,THE BABY CORPS,To the front of the lines with a fearless tread our

1067,THE BABY CORPS,
1068,THE BABY CORPS,"""Forward!"" The air is quaking now; a shrill-"
1069,THE BABY CORPS,"voiced, angry yell"
1070,THE BABY CORPS,
1071,THE BABY CORPS,Answers the roar of the musketry and the scream
1072,THE BABY CORPS,of the rifled shell.
1073,THE BABY CORPS,
1074,THE BABY CORPS,"The gray ranks rushing, horse and foot, at the"

1097,THE BABY CORPS,
1098,THE BABY CORPS,"And huddling under the tender wheat, the living lay"
1099,THE BABY CORPS,"down with the dead,"
1100,THE BABY CORPS,
1101,THE BABY CORPS,And you couldn't have lifted your finger then

1114,THE BABY CORPS,the Yanks have begun a retreat.
1115,THE BABY CORPS,

1117,THE BABY CORPS,"""Hurrah! See our banner a-flyin'!"
1118,THE BABY CORPS,
1119,THE BABY CORPS,"""Wish I was there, but I can't get up--I wonder"

1121,THE BABY CORPS,
1122,THE BABY CORPS,"""O Jim! did you ever hear of a man that lived"

1124,THE BABY CORPS,
1125,THE BABY CORPS,"""Say, Jim! did you ever hear of a man that"
1126,THE BABY CORPS,"lived-- My God! Jim's dead!"""
1127,THE BABY CORPS,
1128,THE BABY CORPS,"A mist, like a web that is heavy with prey, is caught"
1129,THE BABY CORPS,in the green o' the fields;

1131,THE BABY CORPS,It breaks and is parted as if a soul were struggling

1135,THE BABY CORPS,"beating of distant drums,"
1136,THE BABY CORPS,
1137,THE BABY CORPS,And over the shuddering deep of the air a wave of
1138,THE BABY CORPS,silence comes.
1139,THE BABY CORPS,
1140,THE BABY CORPS,By lantern light we found the boys where under the
