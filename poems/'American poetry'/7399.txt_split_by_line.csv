63,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"These verses have always been printed in my collected poems, and as the"
64,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"best of them may bear a single reading, I allow them to appear, but in a"
65,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"less conspicuous position than the other productions.  A chick, before"
66,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"his shell is off his back, is hardly a fair subject for severe criticism."
67,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"If one has written anything worth preserving, his first efforts may be"
68,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,objects of interest and curiosity.  Other young authors may take
69,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"encouragement from seeing how tame, how feeble, how commonplace were the"
70,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,rudimentary attempts of the half-fledged poet. If the boy or youth had
71,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"anything in him, there will probably be some sign of it in the midst of"
72,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"his imitative mediocrities and ambitious failures.  These ""first verses"""
73,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"of mine, written before I was sixteen, have little beyond a common"
74,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,academy boy's ordinary performance.  Yet a kindly critic said there was
75,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,one line which showed a poetical quality:--
76,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,
77,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"""The boiling ocean trembled into calm."""
78,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,
79,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,One of these poems--the reader may guess which--won fair words from
80,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,Thackeray. The Spectre Pig was a wicked suggestion which came into my
81,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"head after reading Dana's Buccaneer. Nobody seemed to find it out, and"
82,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,"I never mentioned it to the venerable poet, who might not have been"
83,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,pleased with the parody.  This is enough to say of these unvalued copies
84,VERSES FROM THE OLDEST PORTFOLIO,of verses.

137,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
138,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Written after a general pruning of the trees around Harvard College.
139,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"A little poem, on a similar occasion, may be found in the works of Swift,"
140,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"from which, perhaps, the idea was borrowed; although I was as much"
141,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,surprised as amused to meet with it some time after writing the following
142,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,lines.
143,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
144,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"IT was not many centuries since,"
145,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"When, gathered on the moonlit green,"
146,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Beneath the Tree of Liberty,"
147,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,A ring of weeping sprites was seen.
148,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
149,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"The freshman's lamp had long been dim,"
150,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"The voice of busy day was mute,"
151,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And tortured Melody had ceased
152,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Her sufferings on the evening flute.
153,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
154,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"They met not as they once had met,"
155,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,To laugh o'er many a jocund tale
156,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"But every pulse was beating low,"
157,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And every cheek was cold and pale.
158,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
159,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"There rose a fair but faded one,"
160,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Who oft had cheered them with her song;
161,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"She waved a mutilated arm,"
162,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And silence held the listening throng.
163,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
164,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""Sweet friends,"" the gentle nymph began,"
165,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""From opening bud to withering leaf,"
166,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"One common lot has bound us all,"
167,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,In every change of joy and grief.
168,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
169,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""While all around has felt decay,"
170,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"We rose in ever-living prime,"
171,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"With broader shade and fresher green,"
172,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Beneath the crumbling step of Time.
173,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
174,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""When often by our feet has past"
175,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Some biped, Nature's walking whim,"
176,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Say, have we trimmed one awkward shape,"
177,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Or lopped away one crooked limb?
178,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
179,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""Go on, fair Science; soon to thee"
180,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Shall. Nature yield her idle boast;
181,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Her vulgar fingers formed a tree,"
182,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,But thou halt trained it to a post.
183,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
184,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""Go, paint the birch's silver rind,"
185,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And quilt the peach with softer down;
186,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Up with the willow's trailing threads,"
187,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Off with the sunflower's radiant crown!
188,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
189,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""Go, plant the lily on the shore,"
190,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"And set the rose among the waves,"
191,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And bid the tropic bud unbind
192,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Its silken zone in arctic caves;
193,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
194,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""Bring bellows for the panting winds,"
195,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Hang up a lantern by the moon,"
196,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"And give the nightingale a fife,"
197,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And lend the eagle a balloon!
198,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
199,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""I cannot smile,--the tide of scorn,"
200,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"That rolled through every bleeding vein,"
201,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Comes kindling fiercer as it flows
202,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Back to its burning source again.
203,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
204,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""Again in every quivering leaf"
205,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"That moment's agony I feel,"
206,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"When limbs, that spurned the northern blast,"
207,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Shrunk from the sacrilegious steel.
208,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
209,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""A curse upon the wretch who dared"
210,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,To crop us with his felon saw!
211,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,May every fruit his lip shall taste
212,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,Lie like a bullet in his maw.
213,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
214,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""In every julep that he drinks,"
215,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"May gout, and bile, and headache be;"
216,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"And when he strives to calm his pain,"
217,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,May colic mingle with his tea.
218,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
219,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""May nightshade cluster round his path,"
220,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"And thistles shoot, and brambles cling;"
221,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"May blistering ivy scorch his veins,"
222,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"And dogwood burn, and nettles sting."
223,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
224,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"""On him may never shadow fall,"
225,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"When fever racks his throbbing brow,"
226,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And his last shilling buy a rope
227,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"To hang him on my highest bough!"""
228,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
229,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,She spoke;--the morning's herald beam
230,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,"Sprang from the bosom of the sea,"
231,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,And every mangled sprite returned
232,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,In sadness to her wounded tree.

234,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
235,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
236,THE MEETING OF THE DRYADS,
237,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR
238,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
239,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"THERE was a sound of hurrying feet,"
240,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"A tramp on echoing stairs,"
241,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"There was a rush along the aisles,--"
242,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,It was the hour of prayers.
243,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
244,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And on, like Ocean's midnight wave,"
245,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"The current rolled along,"
246,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"When, suddenly, a stranger form"
247,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Was seen amidst the throng.
248,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
249,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"He was a dark and swarthy man,"
250,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,That uninvited guest;
251,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,A faded coat of bottle-green
252,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Was buttoned round his breast.
253,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
254,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,There was not one among them all
255,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Could say from whence he came;
256,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Nor beardless boy, nor ancient man,"
257,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Could tell that stranger's name.
258,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
259,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"All silent as the sheeted dead,"
260,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"In spite of sneer and frown,"
261,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Fast by a gray-haired senior's side
262,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,He sat him boldly down.
263,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
264,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,There was a look of horror flashed
265,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,From out the tutor's eyes;
266,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"When all around him rose to pray,"
267,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,The stranger did not rise!
268,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
269,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"A murmur broke along the crowd,"
270,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,The prayer was at an end;
271,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"With ringing heels and measured tread,"
272,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,A hundred forms descend.
273,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
274,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Through sounding aisle, o'er grating stair,"
275,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"The long procession poured,"
276,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Till all were gathered on the seats
277,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Around the Commons board.
278,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
279,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"That fearful stranger! down he sat,"
280,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Unasked, yet undismayed;"
281,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,And on his lip a rising smile
282,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Of scorn or pleasure played.
283,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
284,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"He took his hat and hung it up,"
285,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,With slow but earnest air;
286,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"He stripped his coat from off his back,"
287,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,And placed it on a chair.
288,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
289,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Then from his nearest neighbor's side
290,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,A knife and plate he drew;
291,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And, reaching out his hand again,"
292,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,He took his teacup too.
293,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
294,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,How fled the sugar from the bowl
295,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,How sunk the azure cream!
296,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,They vanished like the shapes that float
297,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Upon a summer's dream.
298,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
299,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"A long, long draught,--an outstretched hand,--"
300,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And crackers, toast, and tea,"
301,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"They faded from the stranger's touch,"
302,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Like dew upon the sea.
303,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
304,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Then clouds were dark on many a brow,"
305,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Fear sat upon their souls,"
306,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And, in a bitter agony,"
307,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,They clasped their buttered rolls.
308,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
309,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"A whisper trembled through the crowd,"
310,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Who could the stranger be?
311,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And some were silent, for they thought"
312,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,A cannibal was he.
313,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
314,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"What if the creature should arise,--"
315,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"For he was stout and tall,--"
316,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"And swallow down a sophomore,"
317,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Coat, crow's-foot, cap, and all!"
318,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
319,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,All sullenly the stranger rose;
320,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,They sat in mute despair;
321,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"He took his hat from off the peg,"
322,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,His coat from off the chair.
323,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
324,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Four freshmen fainted on the seat,"
325,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,Six swooned upon the floor;
326,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Yet on the fearful being passed,"
327,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,And shut the chapel door.
328,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
329,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"There is full many a starving man,"
330,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"That walks in bottle green,"
331,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,But never more that hungry one
332,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,In Commons hall was seen.
333,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,
334,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"Yet often at the sunset hour,"
335,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"When tolls the evening bell,"
336,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,"The freshman lingers on the steps,"
337,THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR,That frightful tale to tell.

342,THE TOADSTOOL,THE TOADSTOOL
343,THE TOADSTOOL,
344,THE TOADSTOOL,"THERE 's a thing that grows by the fainting flower,"
345,THE TOADSTOOL,And springs in the shade of the lady's bower;
346,THE TOADSTOOL,"The lily shrinks, and the rose turns pale,"
347,THE TOADSTOOL,"When they feel its breath in the summer gale,"
348,THE TOADSTOOL,"And the tulip curls its leaves in pride,"
349,THE TOADSTOOL,And the blue-eyed violet starts aside;
350,THE TOADSTOOL,"But the lily may flaunt, and the tulip stare,"
351,THE TOADSTOOL,For what does the honest toadstool care?
352,THE TOADSTOOL,"She does not glow in a painted vest,"
353,THE TOADSTOOL,And she never blooms on the maiden's breast;
354,THE TOADSTOOL,"But she comes, as the saintly sisters do,"
355,THE TOADSTOOL,In a modest suit of a Quaker hue.
356,THE TOADSTOOL,"And, when the stars in the evening skies"
357,THE TOADSTOOL,"Are weeping dew from their gentle eyes,"
358,THE TOADSTOOL,"The toad comes out from his hermit cell,"
359,THE TOADSTOOL,The tale of his faithful love to tell.
360,THE TOADSTOOL,
361,THE TOADSTOOL,"Oh, there is light in her lover's glance,"
362,THE TOADSTOOL,That flies to her heart like a silver lance;
363,THE TOADSTOOL,"His breeches are made of spotted skin,"
364,THE TOADSTOOL,"His jacket 'is tight, and his pumps are thin;"
365,THE TOADSTOOL,"In a cloudless night you may hear his song,"
366,THE TOADSTOOL,"As its pensive melody floats along,"
367,THE TOADSTOOL,"And, if you will look by the moonlight fair,"
368,THE TOADSTOOL,The trembling form of the toad is there.
369,THE TOADSTOOL,
370,THE TOADSTOOL,"And he twines his arms round her slender stem,"
371,THE TOADSTOOL,In the shade of her velvet diadem;
372,THE TOADSTOOL,"But she turns away in her maiden shame,"
373,THE TOADSTOOL,And will not breathe on the kindling flame;
374,THE TOADSTOOL,"He sings at her feet through the live-long night,"
375,THE TOADSTOOL,And creeps to his cave at the break of light;
376,THE TOADSTOOL,"And whenever he comes to the air above,"
377,THE TOADSTOOL,His throat is swelling with baffled love.

392,A BALLAD,"Lay stretched upon the ground,"
393,A BALLAD,And ah! it was the cruel knife
394,A BALLAD,His little heart that found.
395,A BALLAD,
396,A BALLAD,"They took him then, those wicked men,"
397,A BALLAD,They trailed him all along;
398,A BALLAD,"They put a stick between his lips,"
399,A BALLAD,And through his heels a thong;
400,A BALLAD,
401,A BALLAD,And round and round an oaken beam
402,A BALLAD,"A hempen cord they flung,"
403,A BALLAD,"And, like a mighty pendulum,"
404,A BALLAD,All solemnly he swung!
405,A BALLAD,
406,A BALLAD,"Now say thy prayers, thou sinful man,"
407,A BALLAD,"And think what thou hast done,"
408,A BALLAD,"And read thy catechism well,"
409,A BALLAD,Thou bloody-minded one;
410,A BALLAD,
411,A BALLAD,"For if his sprite should walk by night,"
412,A BALLAD,"It better were for thee,"
413,A BALLAD,"That thou wert mouldering in the ground,"
414,A BALLAD,Or bleaching in the sea.
415,A BALLAD,
416,A BALLAD,"It was the savage butcher then,"
417,A BALLAD,"That made a mock of sin,"
418,A BALLAD,"And swore a very wicked oath,"
419,A BALLAD,He did not care a pin.
420,A BALLAD,
421,A BALLAD,"It was the butcher's youngest son,--"
422,A BALLAD,"His voice was broke with sighs,"
423,A BALLAD,And with his pocket-handkerchief
424,A BALLAD,He wiped his little eyes;
425,A BALLAD,
426,A BALLAD,"All young and ignorant was he,"
427,A BALLAD,"But innocent and mild,"
428,A BALLAD,"And, in his soft simplicity,"
429,A BALLAD,Out spoke the tender child:--
430,A BALLAD,
431,A BALLAD,"""Oh, father, father, list to me;"
432,A BALLAD,"The Pig is deadly sick,"
433,A BALLAD,"And men have hung him by his heels,"
434,A BALLAD,"And fed him with a stick."""
435,A BALLAD,
436,A BALLAD,"It was the bloody butcher then,"
437,A BALLAD,"That laughed as he would die,"
438,A BALLAD,"Yet did he soothe the sorrowing child,"
439,A BALLAD,And bid him not to cry;--
440,A BALLAD,
441,A BALLAD,"""Oh, Nathan, Nathan, what's a Pig,"
442,A BALLAD,That thou shouldst weep and wail?
443,A BALLAD,"Come, bear thee like a butcher's child,"
444,A BALLAD,"And thou shalt have his tail!"""
445,A BALLAD,
446,A BALLAD,"It was the butcher's daughter then,"
447,A BALLAD,"So slender and so fair,"
448,A BALLAD,"That sobbed as it her heart would break,"
449,A BALLAD,And tore her yellow hair;
450,A BALLAD,
451,A BALLAD,"And thus she spoke in thrilling tone,--"
452,A BALLAD,Fast fell the tear-drops big:--
453,A BALLAD,"""Ah! woe is me! Alas! Alas!"
454,A BALLAD,"The Pig! The Pig! The Pig!"""
455,A BALLAD,
456,A BALLAD,Then did her wicked father's lips
457,A BALLAD,"Make merry with her woe,"
458,A BALLAD,"And call her many a naughty name,"
459,A BALLAD,Because she whimpered so.
460,A BALLAD,
461,A BALLAD,"Ye need not weep, ye gentle ones,"
462,A BALLAD,"In vain your tears are shed,"
463,A BALLAD,"Ye cannot wash his crimson hand,"
464,A BALLAD,Ye cannot soothe the dead.
465,A BALLAD,
466,A BALLAD,The bright sun folded on his breast
467,A BALLAD,"His robes of rosy flame,"
468,A BALLAD,And softly over all the west
469,A BALLAD,The shades of evening came.
470,A BALLAD,
471,A BALLAD,"He slept, and troops of murdered Pigs"
472,A BALLAD,Were busy with his dreams;
473,A BALLAD,"Loud rang their wild, unearthly shrieks,"
474,A BALLAD,Wide yawned their mortal seams.
475,A BALLAD,
476,A BALLAD,The clock struck twelve; the Dead hath heard;
477,A BALLAD,"He opened both his eyes,"
478,A BALLAD,And sullenly he shook his tail
479,A BALLAD,To lash the feeding flies.
480,A BALLAD,
481,A BALLAD,"One quiver of the hempen cord,--"
482,A BALLAD,"One struggle and one bound,--"
483,A BALLAD,"With stiffened limb and leaden eye,"
484,A BALLAD,The Pig was on the ground.
485,A BALLAD,
486,A BALLAD,And straight towards the sleeper's house
487,A BALLAD,His fearful way he wended;
488,A BALLAD,And hooting owl and hovering bat
489,A BALLAD,On midnight wing attended.
490,A BALLAD,
491,A BALLAD,"Back flew the bolt, up rose the latch,"
492,A BALLAD,"And open swung the door,"
493,A BALLAD,And little mincing feet were heard
494,A BALLAD,"Pat, pat along the floor."
495,A BALLAD,
496,A BALLAD,"Two hoofs upon the sanded floor,"
497,A BALLAD,And two upon the bed;
498,A BALLAD,"And they are breathing side by side,"
499,A BALLAD,The living and the dead!
500,A BALLAD,
501,A BALLAD,"""Now wake, now wake, thou butcher man!"
502,A BALLAD,What makes thy cheek so pale?
503,A BALLAD,Take hold! take hold! thou dost not fear
504,A BALLAD,"To clasp a spectre's tail?"""
505,A BALLAD,
506,A BALLAD,Untwisted every winding coil;
507,A BALLAD,"The shuddering wretch took hold,"
508,A BALLAD,"All like an icicle it seemed,"
509,A BALLAD,So tapering and so cold.
510,A BALLAD,
511,A BALLAD,"""Thou com'st with me, thou butcher man!""--"
512,A BALLAD,"He strives to loose his grasp,"
513,A BALLAD,"But, faster than the clinging vine,"
514,A BALLAD,Those twining spirals clasp;
515,A BALLAD,
516,A BALLAD,"And open, open swung the door,"
517,A BALLAD,"And, fleeter than the wind,"
518,A BALLAD,"The shadowy spectre swept before,"
519,A BALLAD,The butcher trailed behind.
520,A BALLAD,
521,A BALLAD,"Fast fled the darkness of the night,"
522,A BALLAD,And morn rose faint and dim;
523,A BALLAD,"They called full loud, they knocked full long,"
524,A BALLAD,They did not waken him.
525,A BALLAD,
526,A BALLAD,"Straight, straight towards that oaken beam,"
527,A BALLAD,A trampled pathway ran;
528,A BALLAD,"A ghastly shape was swinging there,--"
529,A BALLAD,It was the butcher man.
