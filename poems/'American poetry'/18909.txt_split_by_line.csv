297,PREFACE,Seldom does a book of poems appear that is definitely a response to
298,PREFACE,demand and a reflection of readers' preferences. Of this collection that
299,PREFACE,can properly be claimed. For a decade NORMAL INSTRUCTOR-PRIMARY PLANS
300,PREFACE,"has carried monthly a page entitled ""Poems Our Readers Have Asked For."""
301,PREFACE,"The interest in this page has been, and is, phenomenal. Occasionally"
302,PREFACE,space considerations or copyright restrictions have prevented compliance
303,PREFACE,"with requests, but so far as practicable poems asked for have been"
304,PREFACE,printed. Because it has become impossible to furnish many of the earlier
305,PREFACE,"issues of the magazine, the publishers decided to select the poems most"
306,PREFACE,"often requested and, carefully revising these for possible errors, to"
307,PREFACE,include them in the present collection. In some cases the desired poems
308,PREFACE,"are old favorite dramatic recitations, but many of them are poems that"
309,PREFACE,are required or recommended for memorizing in state courses of study.
310,PREFACE,This latter feature will of itself make the book extremely valuable to
311,PREFACE,teachers throughout the country. We are glad to offer here certain
312,PREFACE,"poems, often requested, but too long for insertion on our magazine"
313,PREFACE,Poetry Page. We are pleased also to be able to include a number of
314,PREFACE,popular copyright poems. Special permission to use these has been
315,PREFACE,"granted through arrangement with the authorized publishers, whose"
316,PREFACE,courtesy is acknowledged below in detail:

549,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Now this it is what happened:

554,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,His brain he vainly cudgeled
555,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But no word was in his head,"
556,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And so he spoke at random,"
557,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And this is what he said;

662,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.
663,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
664,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,I was at work that morning. Some one came riding like mad

673,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
674,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;"
675,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;"
676,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone."
677,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Nearer, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!"
678,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
679,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Sudden I picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar."
680,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""Kentuck!"" I called--""Kentucky!"" She knew me ever so far!"
681,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,"
682,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.
683,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
684,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"As I ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound--"
685,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground--"
686,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Coming into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen--
687,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men."
688,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
689,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm;"
690,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But still I stood in the doorway with baby on my arm.
691,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"They came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along--"
692,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong."
693,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
694,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;"
695,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,"
696,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"To the border strip where Virginia runs up into the West,"
697,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And fording the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.
698,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
699,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;"
700,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance."
701,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,"
702,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.
703,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
704,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,"
705,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place."
706,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I gave him a cup, and he smiled--'twas only a boy, you see;"
707,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Faint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he'd sailed on the Tennessee."
708,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
709,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Only sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother's only son--"
710,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!
711,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;
712,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South.
713,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
714,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Oh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through;"
715,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do;--
716,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be,"
717,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.
718,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
719,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,"
720,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Water came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth."
721,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""Do you know the Blue-Grass country?"" he wistful began to say;"
722,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away."
723,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
724,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to;"
725,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;"
726,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,"
727,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Morgan's men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on."
728,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
729,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""Oh, I must go,"" he muttered; ""I must be up and away!"
730,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Morgan--Morgan is waiting for me; Oh, what will Morgan say?"""
731,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door--
732,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard before.
733,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
734,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And on, on, came the soldiers--the Michigan cavalry--"
735,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly,--"
736,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day and night;
737,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.
738,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
739,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer days;
740,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways--"
741,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,"
742,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Through river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best."
743,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
744,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,A bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last.
745,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,They almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;
746,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,"
747,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword."
748,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
749,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Well, I kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will--"
750,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still."
751,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,When it was cool and dusky--you'll wonder to hear me tell--
752,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But I stole down to that gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle."
753,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
754,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,I kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass--
755,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But I knew that she'd be happy back in the old Blue-Grass.
756,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,"
757,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out lad."
758,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
759,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,I guided him to the southward as well as I know how;
760,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;"
761,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell,"
762,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"As down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!"
763,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
764,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high;"
765,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Baby and I were both crying--I couldn't tell him why--
766,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,"
767,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in Kentucky's stall."
768,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
769,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me;"
770,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"He knew I couldn't help it--'twas all for the Tennessee,"
771,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass--"
772,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"A letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass."
773,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
774,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The lad had got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;"

787,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I remember it all so very well, the first of my married life,"
788,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,That I can't believe it was years ago--it doesn't seem true at all;
789,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Why, I just can see the little church where they made us man and wife,"

792,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
793,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"_We were happy?_ Yes; and we prospered, too; the house belonged"
794,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"to Joe,"
795,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then, he worked in the planing mill, and drew the best of pay;"

798,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
799,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"It wasn't long till Joe found work, but 'twas never quite the same,--"

801,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"He fell to inventin' some machine--I don't recall the name,"
802,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But he'd sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the

804,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
805,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Sit for hours, bent over his work, his tools all strewn about."
806,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor,"
807,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But 'twas just as if 'twas the parson there, writing his sermon out;"

815,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
816,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I didn't want 'em, the grand new things, but it made the big tears start"

818,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"To the skin and bone, for he wouldn't eat; and it almost broke my heart"
819,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"When he tossed at night from side to side, till the dawning of the day."
820,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
821,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Of course, with it all he lost his place. I couldn't blame the man,"
822,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in Joe,"
823,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"For his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan,"
824,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,As with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro.
825,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
826,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Yet, he kept on workin' at various things, till our little money went"
827,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,For wheels and screws and metal casts and things I had never seen;

835,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"He went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from"

838,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
839,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I hadn't the heart to cross the child, so, while I sat and sewed"
840,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,He would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side;
841,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And when the struggle was hardest and I felt keen hunger's goad

847,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,He stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew.
848,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
849,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I cannot tell how I lived that week, my little boy and I,"
850,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild.
851,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky,"
852,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried"

854,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
855,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Joe still toiled in the little shop. Somebody clicked the gate;
856,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"A neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor,"
857,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But I sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate,"
858,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Till I heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and I sprang to the workshop
859,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,door.
860,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
861,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"That door was locked and the bolt shut fast. I could not cry, nor speak,"
862,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But I snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread,"
863,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak,"
864,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head;
865,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
866,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The front door yielded to my touch. I staggered faintly in,"
867,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Fearing--_what_? He stood unharmed, though the wall showed a"

869,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"In his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin"
870,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Of his own life's blood was not yet laid on the poor man's tortured soul.
871,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
872,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But the pistol held another charge, I knew; and like something mad"
873,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"I shook my fist in my poor man's face, and shrieked at him, fierce and"
874,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"wild,"
875,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""How can you dare to rob us so?""--and I seized the little lad;"
876,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""How can you dare to rob your wife and your little helpless child?"""
877,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
878,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"All of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand"
879,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"That hung so limp, I almost feared to see the pistol fall."
880,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""Maggie,"" he said in a low, low voice, ""you see me as I stand"
881,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"A hopeless man. My plan has failed. That letter tells you all."""
882,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
883,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Then for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death;
884,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o'er;"
885,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But no;--there followed another sound, and I started, caught my breath;"
886,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,As a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door.
887,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
888,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,I shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise;
889,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,He must have guessed our awful state; he couldn't help but see
890,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"There was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes"
891,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to Joe and me."
892,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
893,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"He was come from a thriving city firm, and they'd sent him here to say"
894,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"That _one_ of Joe's inventions was a great, successful thing;"
895,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And which do you think? His window-catch that he'd tinkered up one day;
896,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring.
897,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
898,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream."
899,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"My man bent down his head and said, ""Little woman, you've saved my life!"""

923,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,From the heads of kings I have torn the crown;
924,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,From the heights of fame I have hurled men down.
925,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,I have blasted many an honored name;

1889,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And the maid of his heart was up above
1890,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Surrounded by hat and gown and glove,"
1891,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And a thousand things which women love,"
1892,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But no man knoweth the names thereof--
1893,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And the young man sat and--waited.
1894,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
1895,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"You will scarce believe the things I tell,"
1896,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But the truth thereof I know full well,"
1897,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Though how may not be stated;
1898,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But I swear to you that the maiden took
1899,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"A sort of half-breed, thin stove-hook,"
1900,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And heated it well in the gaslight there.
1901,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And thrust it into her head, or hair."
1902,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then she took something off the bed,"
1903,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And hooked it onto her hair, or head,"
1904,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And piled it high, and piled it higher,"
1905,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And drove it home with staples of wire!
1906,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And the young man anxiously--waited.
1907,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
1908,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then she took a thing she called a ""puff"""
1909,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And some very peculiar whitish stuff,"
1910,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And using about a half a peck,"
1911,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"She spread it over her face and neck,"
1912,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,(Deceit was a thing she hated!)
1913,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And she looked as fair as a lilied bower,"
1914,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Or a pound of lard or a sack of flour;--
1915,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And the young man wearily--waited.
1916,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
1917,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Then she took a garment of awful shape
1918,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And it wasn't a waist, nor yet a cape,"
1919,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But it looked like a piece of ancient mail,"
1920,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Or an instrument from a Russian jail,"
1921,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then with a fearful groan and gasp,"
1922,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,She squeezed herself in its deathly clasp--
1923,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,So fair and yet so fated!
1924,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then with a move like I don't know what,"
1925,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,She tied it on with a double knot;--
1926,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And the young man wofully--waited.
1927,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
1928,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then she put on a dozen different things,"
1929,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"A mixture of buttons and hooks and strings,"
1930,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Till she strongly resembled a notion store;
1931,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then, taking some seventeen pins or more,"
1932,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"She thrust them into her ruby lips,"
1933,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then stuck them around from waist to hips,"
1934,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And never once hesitated.
1935,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And the maiden didn't know, perhaps,"
1936,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"That the man below had had seven naps,"
1937,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And that now he sleepily--waited.
1938,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
1939,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then she tried to put on her hat,"
1940,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Ah me, a trying ordeal was that!"
1941,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"She tipped it high and she tried it low,"
1942,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,But every way that the thing would go
1943,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Only made her more agitated.
1944,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"It wouldn't go straight and it caught her hair,"
1945,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And she wished she could hire a man to swear,"
1946,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But alas, the only man lingering there"
1947,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Was the one who wildly--waited.
1948,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
1949,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then before she could take her leave,"
1950,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,She had to puff up her monstrous sleeve.
1951,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Then a little dab here and a wee pat there.
1952,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And a touch or two to her hindmost hair,"
1953,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Then around the room with the utmost care
1954,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,She thoughtfully circulated.
1955,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then she seized her gloves and a chamoiskin,"
1956,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Some breath perfume and a long stickpin,"
1957,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,A bonbon box and a cloak and some
1958,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Eau-de-cologne and chewing-gum,"
1959,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Her opera glass and sealskin muff,"
1960,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,A fan and a heap of other stuff;
1961,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then she hurried down, but ere she spoke,"
1962,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Something about the maiden broke.
1963,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"So she scurried back to the winding stair,"
1964,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And the young man looked in wild despair,"
1965,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And then he--evaporated.

2646,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Was watching for his coming from the corner of her eye.
2647,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2648,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"His face was broad and honest, his hands were brown and tough,"
2649,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"The clothes he wore upon him were homespun, coarse, and rough;"
2650,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But one there was who watched him, who long time lingered nigh,"
2651,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And cast at him sweet glances from the corner of her eye.
2652,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2653,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"He drove up to the market, he waited in the line--"
2654,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,His apples and potatoes were fresh and fair and fine.
2655,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But long and long he waited, and no one came to buy,"
2656,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Save the black-eyed rebel, watching from the corner of her eye."
2657,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2658,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""Now, who will buy my apples?"" he shouted, long and loud;"
2659,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And, ""Who wants my potatoes?"" he repeated to the crowd."
2660,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But from all the people round him came no word of reply,"
2661,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Save the black-eyed rebel, answering from the corner of her eye."
2662,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2663,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,For she knew that 'neath the lining of the coat he wore that day
2664,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Were long letters from the husbands and the fathers far away,"
2665,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Who were fighting for the freedom that they meant to gain, or die;"
2666,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And a tear like silver glistened in the corner of her eye.
2667,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2668,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But the treasures--how to get them? crept the question through her mind,"
2669,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Since keen enemies were watching for what prizes they might find;
2670,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And she paused a while and pondered, with a pretty little sigh,"
2671,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Then resolve crept through her features, and a shrewdness fired her eye."
2672,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2673,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,So she resolutely walked up to the wagon old and red--
2674,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""May I have a dozen apples for a kiss?"" she sweetly said;"
2675,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And the brown face flushed to scarlet, for the boy was somewhat shy,"
2676,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And he saw her laughing at him from the corner of her eye.
2677,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2678,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""You may have them all for nothing, and more, if you want,"" quoth he."
2679,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""I will have them, my good fellow, but can pay for them,"" said she."
2680,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And she clambered on the wagon, minding not who all were by,"
2681,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,With a laugh of reckless romping in the corner of her eye.
2682,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2683,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Clinging round his brawny neck, she clasped her fingers white and small,"
2684,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And then whispered, ""Quick! the letters! thrust them underneath my shawl!"
2685,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Carry back again _this_ package, and be sure that you are spry!"""
2686,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,And she sweetly smiled upon him from the corner of her eye.
2687,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2688,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Loud the motley crowd was laughing at the strange, ungirlish freak;"
2689,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And the boy was scared and panting, and so dashed he could not speak."
2690,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"And ""Miss, I have good apples,"" a bolder lad did cry;"
2691,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"But she answered, ""No, I thank you,"" from the corner of her eye."
2692,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,
2693,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"With the news from loved ones absent to the dear friends they would greet,"
2694,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"Searching them who hungered for them, swift she glided through the street."
2695,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,"""There is nothing worth the doing that it does not pay to try,"""
2696,POEMS TEACHERS ASK FOR,Thought the little black-eyed rebel with a twinkle in her eye.

3574,MATERNITY,
3575,MATERNITY,
3576,MATERNITY,"Did you ever hear of the Drummer Boy of Mission Ridge, who lay"
3577,MATERNITY,"With his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of"
3578,MATERNITY,that terrible day?
3579,MATERNITY,"They were firing above him and firing below, and the tempest of shot"
3580,MATERNITY,and shell
3581,MATERNITY,"Was raging like death, as he moaned in his pain, by the breastworks"
3582,MATERNITY,where he fell.
3583,MATERNITY,
3584,MATERNITY,"""Go back with your corps,"" our colonel had said, but he waited the"
3585,MATERNITY,moment when
3586,MATERNITY,He might follow the ranks and shoulder a gun with the best of us
3587,MATERNITY,bearded men;
3588,MATERNITY,"And so when the signals from old Fort Wood set an army of veterans wild,"
3589,MATERNITY,"He flung down his drum, which spun down the hill like the ball of a"
3590,MATERNITY,wayward child.
3591,MATERNITY,
3592,MATERNITY,"And then he fell in with the foremost ranks of brave old company G,"
3593,MATERNITY,"As we charged by the flank, with our colors ahead, and our columns"
3594,MATERNITY,"closed up like a V,"
3595,MATERNITY,"In the long, swinging lines of that splendid advance, when the flags"
3596,MATERNITY,"of our corps floated out,"
3597,MATERNITY,Like the ribbons that dance in the jubilant lines of the march of a
3598,MATERNITY,gala day rout.
3599,MATERNITY,
3600,MATERNITY,"He charged with the ranks, though he carried no gun, for the colonel"
3601,MATERNITY,"had said him nay,"
3602,MATERNITY,"And he breasted the blast of the bristling guns, and the shock of the"
3603,MATERNITY,sickening fray;
3604,MATERNITY,And when by his side they were falling like hail he sprang to a comrade
3605,MATERNITY,"slain,"
3606,MATERNITY,And shouldered his musket and bore it as true as the hand that was dead
3607,MATERNITY,in pain.
3608,MATERNITY,
3609,MATERNITY,"'Twas dearly we loved him, our Drummer Boy, with a fire in his bright,"
3610,MATERNITY,"black eye,"
3611,MATERNITY,That flashed forth a spirit too great for his form--he only was just so
3612,MATERNITY,"high,"
3613,MATERNITY,"As tall, perhaps, as your little lad who scarcely reaches your shoulder--"
3614,MATERNITY,"Though his heart was the heart of a veteran then, a trifle, it may be,"
3615,MATERNITY,bolder.
3616,MATERNITY,
3617,MATERNITY,"He pressed to the front, our lad so leal, and the works were almost won,"
3618,MATERNITY,A moment more and our flags had swung o'er the muzzle of murderous gun;
3619,MATERNITY,"But a raking fire swept the van, and he fell 'mid the wounded and slain,"
3620,MATERNITY,With his wee wan face turned up to Him who feeleth His children's pain.
3621,MATERNITY,
3622,MATERNITY,"Again and again our lines fell back, and again with shivering shocks"
3623,MATERNITY,They flung themselves on the rebels' works as ships are tossed on rocks;
3624,MATERNITY,"To be crushed and broken and scattered amain, as the wrecks of the"
3625,MATERNITY,surging storm.
3626,MATERNITY,Where none may rue and none may reck of aught that has human form.
3627,MATERNITY,
3628,MATERNITY,"So under the ridge we were lying for the order to charge again,"
3629,MATERNITY,"And we counted our comrades missing, and we counted our comrades slain;"
3630,MATERNITY,"And one said, ""Johnny, our Drummer Boy, is grievously shot and lies"
3631,MATERNITY,"Just under the enemy's breastwork; if left on the field he dies."""
3632,MATERNITY,
3633,MATERNITY,"Then all the blood that was in me  surged up to my aching brow,"
3634,MATERNITY,"And my heart leaped up like a ball in my throat--I can feel it even now,"
3635,MATERNITY,"And I said I would bring that boy from the field, if God would spare my"
3636,MATERNITY,"breath,"
3637,MATERNITY,If all the guns in Mission Ridge should thunder the threat of death.
3638,MATERNITY,
3639,MATERNITY,"I crept and crept up the ghastly ridge, by the wounded and the dead,"
3640,MATERNITY,"With the moans of my comrades right and left, behind me and yet ahead,"
3641,MATERNITY,"Till I came to the form of our Drummer Boy, in his blouse of dusty blue,"
3642,MATERNITY,"With his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, where the blast of"
3643,MATERNITY,the battle blew.
3644,MATERNITY,
3645,MATERNITY,And his gaze as he met my own just there would have melted a heart of
3646,MATERNITY,"stone,"
3647,MATERNITY,"As he tried like a wounded bird to rise, and placed his hand in my own;"
3648,MATERNITY,"And he said in a voice half smothered, though its whispering thrills"
3649,MATERNITY,"me yet,"
3650,MATERNITY,"""I think in a moment more that I would have stood on that parapet."
3651,MATERNITY,
3652,MATERNITY,"""But now I nevermore will climb, and, Sergeant, when you see"
3653,MATERNITY,"The men go up those breastworks there, just stop and waken me;"
3654,MATERNITY,"For though I cannot make the charge  and join the cheers that rise,"
3655,MATERNITY,"I may forget my pain to see the old flag kiss the skies."""
3656,MATERNITY,
3657,MATERNITY,"Well, it was hard to treat him so, his poor limb shattered sore,"
3658,MATERNITY,But I raised him on my shoulder and to the surgeon bore;
3659,MATERNITY,"And the boys who saw us coming each gave a shout of joy,"
3660,MATERNITY,"And uttered fervent prayers for him, our valiant Drummer Boy."
3661,MATERNITY,
3662,MATERNITY,"When sped the news that ""Fighting Joe"" had saved the Union right,"
3663,MATERNITY,With his legions fresh from Lookout; and that Thomas massed his might
3664,MATERNITY,And forced the rebel center; and our cheering ran like wild;
3665,MATERNITY,And Sherman's heart was happy as the heart of a little child;
3666,MATERNITY,
3667,MATERNITY,When Grant from his lofty outlook saw our flags by the hundred fly
3668,MATERNITY,"Along the slopes of Mission Ridge, where'er he cast his eye;"
3669,MATERNITY,"And when we heard the thrilling news of the mighty battle done,"
3670,MATERNITY,"The fearful contest ended, and the glorious victory won;"
3671,MATERNITY,
3672,MATERNITY,"Then his bright black eyes so yearning grew strangely rapt and wide,"
3673,MATERNITY,And in that hour of conquest our little hero died.
3674,MATERNITY,"But ever in our hearts he dwells, with a grace that ne'er is old,"
3675,MATERNITY,For him the heart to duty wed can nevermore grow cold!
3676,MATERNITY,
3677,MATERNITY,"And when they tell of heroes, and the laurels they have won,"
3678,MATERNITY,"Of the scars they are doomed to carry, of the deeds that they have done;"
3679,MATERNITY,"Of the horror to be biding among the ghastly dead,"
3680,MATERNITY,"The gory sod beneath them, the bursting shell o'erhead,"
3681,MATERNITY,
3682,MATERNITY,My heart goes back to Mission Ridge and the Drummer Boy who lay
3683,MATERNITY,"With his face to the foe, 'neath the enemy's guns, in the charge of"
3684,MATERNITY,that terrible day;
3685,MATERNITY,And I say that the land that bears such sons is crowned and dowered
3686,MATERNITY,with all
3687,MATERNITY,The dear God giveth nations to stay them lest they fall.
3688,MATERNITY,
3689,MATERNITY,"Oh, glory of Mission Ridge, stream on, like the roseate light of morn,"
3690,MATERNITY,"On the sons that now are living, on the sons that are yet unborn!"
3691,MATERNITY,"And cheers for our comrades living, and tears as they pass away!"

3745,MATERNITY,Some boys are mad when comp'ny comes to stay for meals. They hate
3746,MATERNITY,"To have the other people eat while boys must wait and wait,"
3747,MATERNITY,"But I've about made up my mind I'm different from the rest,"
3748,MATERNITY,"For as for me, I b'lieve I like the second table best."
3749,MATERNITY,
3750,MATERNITY,"To eat along with comp'ny is so trying, for it's tough"
3751,MATERNITY,To sit and watch the victuals when you dassent touch the stuff.
3752,MATERNITY,You see your father serving out the dark meat and the light
3753,MATERNITY,Until a boy is sure he'll starve before he gets a bite.
3754,MATERNITY,
3755,MATERNITY,"And when, he asks you what you'll have,--you've heard it all before,--"
3756,MATERNITY,You know you'll get just what you get and won't get nothing more;
3757,MATERNITY,"For, when you want another piece, your mother winks her eye,"
3758,MATERNITY,"And so you say, ""I've plenty, thanks!"" and tell a whopping lie."
3759,MATERNITY,
3760,MATERNITY,"When comp'ny is a-watching you, you've got to be polite,"
3761,MATERNITY,And eat your victuals with a fork and take a little bite.
3762,MATERNITY,"You can't have nothing till you're asked and, 'cause a boy is small,"
3763,MATERNITY,"Folks think he isn't hungry, and he's never asked at all."
3764,MATERNITY,
3765,MATERNITY,Since I can first remember I've been told that when the cake
3766,MATERNITY,"Is passed around, the proper thing is for a boy to take"
3767,MATERNITY,"The piece that's nearest to him, and so all I ever got,"
3768,MATERNITY,"When comp'ny's been to our house, was the smallest in the lot."
3769,MATERNITY,
3770,MATERNITY,It worries boys like everything to have the comp'ny stay
3771,MATERNITY,"A-setting round the table, like they couldn't get away."
3772,MATERNITY,"But when they've gone, and left the whole big shooting match to me,"
3773,MATERNITY,"Say! ain't it fun to just wade in and help myself? Oh, gee!"
3774,MATERNITY,
3775,MATERNITY,With no one round to notice what you're doing--bet your life!--
3776,MATERNITY,"Boys don't use forks to eat with when they'd rather use a knife,"
3777,MATERNITY,Nor take such little bites as when they're eating with the rest
3778,MATERNITY,"And so, for lots of things, I like the second table best"

3810,MATERNITY,"Of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them,"
3811,MATERNITY,Of the tempest of Fate blowing wild;
3812,MATERNITY,"Oh, there's nothing on earth half so holy"
3813,MATERNITY,As the innocent heart of a child!
3814,MATERNITY,
3815,MATERNITY,They are idols of hearts and of households;
3816,MATERNITY,They are angels of God in disguise;
3817,MATERNITY,"His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,"
3818,MATERNITY,His glory still gleams in their eyes;
3819,MATERNITY,"Oh, these truants from home and from heaven,--"
3820,MATERNITY,They have made me more manly and mild;
3821,MATERNITY,And I know now how Jesus could liken
3822,MATERNITY,The kingdom of God to a child!
3823,MATERNITY,
3824,MATERNITY,I ask not a life for the dear ones
3825,MATERNITY,"All radiant, as others have done,"
3826,MATERNITY,But that life may have just enough shadow
3827,MATERNITY,To temper the glare of the sun;
3828,MATERNITY,"I would pray God to guard them from evil,"
3829,MATERNITY,But my prayer would bound back to myself;
3830,MATERNITY,"Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,"
3831,MATERNITY,But a sinner must pray for himself.
3832,MATERNITY,
3833,MATERNITY,"The twig is so easily bended,"
3834,MATERNITY,I have banished the rule and the rod;
3835,MATERNITY,"I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,"
3836,MATERNITY,They have taught me the goodness of God.
3837,MATERNITY,"My heart is the dungeon of darkness,"
3838,MATERNITY,Where I shut them for breaking a rule;
3839,MATERNITY,My frown is sufficient correction;
3840,MATERNITY,My love is the law of the school.
3841,MATERNITY,
3842,MATERNITY,"I shall leave the old house in the autumn,"
3843,MATERNITY,To traverse its threshold no more;
3844,MATERNITY,Ah! how shall I sigh for the dear ones
3845,MATERNITY,That meet me each morn at the door!
3846,MATERNITY,"I shall miss the ""good nights"" and the kisses,"
3847,MATERNITY,And the gush of their innocent glee.
3848,MATERNITY,"The group on its green, and the flowers"
3849,MATERNITY,That are brought every morning to me.
3850,MATERNITY,
3851,MATERNITY,"I shall miss them at morn and at even,"
3852,MATERNITY,Their song in the school and the street;
3853,MATERNITY,"I shall miss the low hum of their voices,"
3854,MATERNITY,And the tread of their delicate feet.
3855,MATERNITY,"When the lessons of life are all ended,"
3856,MATERNITY,"And death says, ""The school is dismissed!"""
3857,MATERNITY,May the little ones gather around me
3858,MATERNITY,To bid me good night and be kissed!

3865,MATERNITY,A Visit from St. Nicholas
3866,MATERNITY,
3867,MATERNITY,
3868,MATERNITY,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house"
3869,MATERNITY,"Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;"
3870,MATERNITY,"The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,"
3871,MATERNITY,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
3872,MATERNITY,"The children were nestled all snug in their beds,"
3873,MATERNITY,While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
3874,MATERNITY,"And mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,"
3875,MATERNITY,"Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,--"
3876,MATERNITY,"When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,"
3877,MATERNITY,I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
3878,MATERNITY,"Away to the window I flew like a flash,"
3879,MATERNITY,Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
3880,MATERNITY,"The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,"
3881,MATERNITY,Gave a luster of midday to objects below:
3882,MATERNITY,"When what to my wondering eyes should appear,"
3883,MATERNITY,"But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,"
3884,MATERNITY,"With a little old driver, so lively and quick,"
3885,MATERNITY,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
3886,MATERNITY,"More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,"
3887,MATERNITY,"And he whistled and shouted, and called them by name:"
3888,MATERNITY,"""Now, Dasher! now Dancer! now, Prancer! now Vixen!"
3889,MATERNITY,"On, Comet, on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!--"
3890,MATERNITY,"To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!"
3891,MATERNITY,"Now, dash away, dash sway, dash away all!"""
3892,MATERNITY,"As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,"
3893,MATERNITY,"When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,"
3894,MATERNITY,"So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,"
3895,MATERNITY,"With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too,"
3896,MATERNITY,And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof
3897,MATERNITY,The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
3898,MATERNITY,"As I drew in my head, and was turning around,"
3899,MATERNITY,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
3900,MATERNITY,"He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,"
3901,MATERNITY,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
3902,MATERNITY,"A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,"
3903,MATERNITY,And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
3904,MATERNITY,His eyes how they twinkled; his dimples how merry!
3905,MATERNITY,"His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;"
3906,MATERNITY,"His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,"
3907,MATERNITY,And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.
3908,MATERNITY,"The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,"
3909,MATERNITY,"And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath."
3910,MATERNITY,He had a broad face and a little round belly
3911,MATERNITY,"That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly."
3912,MATERNITY,He was chubby and plump--a right jolly old elf--
3913,MATERNITY,"And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself."
3914,MATERNITY,"A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head,"
3915,MATERNITY,Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
3916,MATERNITY,"He spake not a word, but went straight to his work,"
3917,MATERNITY,"And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,"
3918,MATERNITY,And laying his finger aside of his nose
3919,MATERNITY,"And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose."
3920,MATERNITY,"He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,"
3921,MATERNITY,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;
3922,MATERNITY,"But I heard him exclaim, ere they drove out of sight,"
3923,MATERNITY,"""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"""

3989,MATERNITY,In a fellowless firmament;

3991,MATERNITY,Where highways never ran;
3992,MATERNITY,But let me live by the side of the road
3993,MATERNITY,And be a friend to man.
3994,MATERNITY,

4017,MATERNITY,"But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,"
4018,MATERNITY,And weep with the strangers that moan.

4040,MATERNITY,"With the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling, as much as to"
4041,MATERNITY,say:
4042,MATERNITY,"""Come, master, awake, attend to the switch, lives now depend upon you."
4043,MATERNITY,"Think of the souls in the coming train, and the graves you are sending"
4044,MATERNITY,them to.
4045,MATERNITY,"Think of the mother and the babe at her breast, think of the father and"
4046,MATERNITY,"son,"
4047,MATERNITY,"Think of the lover and the loved one too, think of them doomed every one"
4048,MATERNITY,"To fall (as it were by your very hand) into yon fathomless ditch,"
4049,MATERNITY,"Murdered by one who should guard them from harm, who now lies asleep at"
4050,MATERNITY,"the switch."""
4051,MATERNITY,
4052,MATERNITY,"I sprang up amazed--scarce knew where I stood, sleep had o'ermastered"
4053,MATERNITY,me so;
4054,MATERNITY,"I could hear the wind hollowly howling, and the deep river dashing below,"
4055,MATERNITY,"I could hear the forest leaves rustling, as the trees by the tempest were"
4056,MATERNITY,"fanned,"
4057,MATERNITY,"But what was that noise in the distance? That, I could not understand."
4058,MATERNITY,"I heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some muffled drum,"
4059,MATERNITY,"Then nearer and nearer it came to me, till it made my very ears hum;"
4060,MATERNITY,What is this light that surrounds me and seems to set fire to my brain?
4061,MATERNITY,"What whistle's that, yelling so shrill? Ah! I know now; it's the train."
4062,MATERNITY,
4063,MATERNITY,"We often stand facing some danger, and seem to take root to the place;"
4064,MATERNITY,"So I stood--with this demon before me, its heated breath scorching my"
4065,MATERNITY,face;
4066,MATERNITY,"Its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared like the eyes of"
4067,MATERNITY,"some witch,--"
4068,MATERNITY,The train was almost upon me before I remembered the switch.
4069,MATERNITY,"I sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast down the track;"
4070,MATERNITY,"The switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed holding it back;"
4071,MATERNITY,"On, on came the fiery-eyed monster, and shot by my face like a flash;"
4072,MATERNITY,"I swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew nothing after the crash."
4073,MATERNITY,
4074,MATERNITY,How long I lay there unconscious 'twas impossible for me to tell;
4075,MATERNITY,"My stupor was almost a heaven, my waking almost a hell,--"
4076,MATERNITY,"For then I heard the piteous moaning and shrieking of husbands and wives,"
4077,MATERNITY,"And I thought of the day we all shrink from, when I must account for"
4078,MATERNITY,their lives;
4079,MATERNITY,"Mothers rushed by me like maniacs, their eyes glaring madly and wild;"
4080,MATERNITY,"Fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief like a child;"
4081,MATERNITY,"Children searching for parents, I noticed, as by me they sped,"
4082,MATERNITY,"And lips, that could form naught but ""Mamma,"" were calling for one"
4083,MATERNITY,perhaps dead.
4084,MATERNITY,
4085,MATERNITY,"My mind was made up in a moment, the river should hide me away,"
4086,MATERNITY,"When, under the still burning rafters I suddenly noticed there lay"
4087,MATERNITY,A little white hand; she who owned it was doubtless an object of love
4088,MATERNITY,"To one whom her loss would drive frantic, though she guarded him now"
4089,MATERNITY,from above;
4090,MATERNITY,I tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one side;
4091,MATERNITY,"How little she thought of her journey when she left for this dark, fatal"
4092,MATERNITY,ride!
4093,MATERNITY,"I lifted the last log from off her, and while searching for some spark"
4094,MATERNITY,"of life,"
4095,MATERNITY,"Turned her little face up in the starlight, and recognized--Maggie, my"
4096,MATERNITY,wife!
4097,MATERNITY,
4098,MATERNITY,"O Lord! my scourge is a hard one, at a blow thou hast shattered my pride;"
4099,MATERNITY,"My life will be one endless nightmare, with Maggie away from my side."
4100,MATERNITY,"How often I'd sat down and pictured the scenes in our long, happy life;"
4101,MATERNITY,"How I'd strive through all my lifetime, to build up a home for my wife;"
4102,MATERNITY,How people would envy us always in our cozy and neat little nest;
4103,MATERNITY,"How I should do all the labor, and Maggie should all the day rest;"
4104,MATERNITY,"How one of God's blessings might cheer us, how some day I perhaps should"
4105,MATERNITY,be rich:--
4106,MATERNITY,"But all of my dreams had been shattered, while I lay there asleep at the"
4107,MATERNITY,switch!
4108,MATERNITY,
4109,MATERNITY,"I fancied I stood on my trial, the jury and judge I could see;"
4110,MATERNITY,And every eye in the court room was steadily fixed upon me;
4111,MATERNITY,"And fingers were pointed in scorn, till I felt my face blushing blood-red,"
4112,MATERNITY,"And the next thing I heard were the words, ""Hanged by the neck until"
4113,MATERNITY,"dead."""
4114,MATERNITY,"Then I felt myself pulled once again, and my hand caught tight hold of a"
4115,MATERNITY,"dress,"
4116,MATERNITY,"And I heard, ""What's the matter, dear Jim? You've had a bad nightmare, I"
4117,MATERNITY,"guess!"""
4118,MATERNITY,"And there stood Maggie, my wife, with never a scar from the ditch,"
4119,MATERNITY,"I'd been taking a nap in my bed, and had not been ""asleep at the switch."""

4315,MATERNITY,In the land that lies beyond
4316,MATERNITY,"Erzeroum and Trebizond,"
4317,MATERNITY,Garden-girt his fortress stood;
4318,MATERNITY,"Plundered khan, or caravan"

4327,MATERNITY,Seeking without guide his way.
4328,MATERNITY,
4329,MATERNITY,"Suddenly the pathway ends,"
4330,MATERNITY,"Sheer the precipice descends,"
4331,MATERNITY,Loud the torrent roars unseen;

4346,MATERNITY,"Sang to him in his wild way,"

4368,MATERNITY,And into the air's embrace

4714,EXTRACT,I make no apology; I've learned owleology.

4724,EXTRACT,"And other night fowls,"
4725,EXTRACT,And I tell you
4726,EXTRACT,What I know to be true:
4727,EXTRACT,An owl cannot roost
4728,EXTRACT,With his limbs so unloosed;
4729,EXTRACT,No owl in this world

4742,EXTRACT,And to see such a job almost moves me to tears!
4743,EXTRACT,"Mister Brown, I'm amazed"

4745,EXTRACT,As to put up a bird
4746,EXTRACT,In that posture absurd!

4762,EXTRACT,
4763,EXTRACT,"""With some sawdust and bark"
4764,EXTRACT,I could stuff in the dark
4765,EXTRACT,An owl better than that.
4766,EXTRACT,I could make an old hat

4881,EXTRACT,"In vain I strove to reach it through the tangled mass of green,"

4930,EXTRACT,
4931,EXTRACT,
4932,EXTRACT,You're surprised that I ever should say so?
4933,EXTRACT,Just wait till the reason I've given

4938,EXTRACT,"That unless there's a boy there a-whistling,"
4939,EXTRACT,Its music will not be complete.
4940,EXTRACT,
4941,EXTRACT,It was late in the autumn of '40;
4942,EXTRACT,We had come from our far Eastern home
4943,EXTRACT,"Just in season to build us a cabin,"
4944,EXTRACT,Ere the cold of the winter should come;
4945,EXTRACT,And we lived all the while in our wagon
4946,EXTRACT,That husband was clearing the place
4947,EXTRACT,Where the house was to stand; and the clearing
4948,EXTRACT,And building it took many days.
4949,EXTRACT,
4950,EXTRACT,So that our heads were scarce sheltered
4951,EXTRACT,In under its roof when our store
4952,EXTRACT,"Of provisions was almost exhausted,"
4953,EXTRACT,And husband must journey for more;
4954,EXTRACT,And the nearest place where he could get them
4955,EXTRACT,"Was yet such a distance away,"
4956,EXTRACT,That it forced him from home to be absent
4957,EXTRACT,At least a whole night and a day.
4958,EXTRACT,
4959,EXTRACT,"You see, we'd but two or three neighbors,"
4960,EXTRACT,And the nearest was more than a mile;
4961,EXTRACT,"And we hadn't found time yet to know them,"
4962,EXTRACT,For we had been busy the while.
4963,EXTRACT,And the man who had helped at the raising
4964,EXTRACT,Just staid till the job was well done;
4965,EXTRACT,And as soon as his money was paid him
4966,EXTRACT,Had shouldered his axe and had gone.
4967,EXTRACT,
4968,EXTRACT,"Well, husband just kissed me and started--"
4969,EXTRACT,I could scarcely suppress a deep groan
4970,EXTRACT,At the thought of remaining with baby
4971,EXTRACT,So long in the house alone;
4972,EXTRACT,"For, my dear, I was childish and timid,"
4973,EXTRACT,"And braver ones might well have feared,"
4974,EXTRACT,For the wild wolf was often heard howling.
4975,EXTRACT,And savages sometimes appeared.
4976,EXTRACT,
4977,EXTRACT,But I smothered my grief and my terror
4978,EXTRACT,"Till husband was off on his ride,"
4979,EXTRACT,"And then in my arms I took Josey,"
4980,EXTRACT,"And all the day long sat and cried,"
4981,EXTRACT,"As I thought of the long, dreary hours"
4982,EXTRACT,"When the darkness of night should fall,"
4983,EXTRACT,"And I was so utterly helpless,"
4984,EXTRACT,With no one in reach of my call.
4985,EXTRACT,
4986,EXTRACT,"And when the night came with its terrors,"
4987,EXTRACT,"To hide ev'ry ray of light,"
4988,EXTRACT,"I hung up a quilt by the window,"
4989,EXTRACT,"And, almost dead with affright,"
4990,EXTRACT,"I kneeled by the side of the cradle,"
4991,EXTRACT,"Scarce daring to draw a full breath,"
4992,EXTRACT,"Lest the baby should wake, and its crying"
4993,EXTRACT,Should bring us a horrible death.
4994,EXTRACT,
4995,EXTRACT,There I knelt until late in the evening
4996,EXTRACT,"And scarcely an inch had I stirred,"
4997,EXTRACT,"When suddenly, far in the distance,"
4998,EXTRACT,A sound as of whistling I heard.
4999,EXTRACT,"I started up dreadfully frightened,"
5000,EXTRACT,For fear 'twas an Indian's call;
5001,EXTRACT,And then very soon I remembered
5002,EXTRACT,The red man ne'er whistles at all.
5003,EXTRACT,
5004,EXTRACT,"And when I was sure 'twas a white man,"
5005,EXTRACT,"I thought, were he coming for ill,"
5006,EXTRACT,He'd surely approach with more caution--
5007,EXTRACT,"Would come without warning, and still."
5008,EXTRACT,"Then the sound, coming nearer and nearer,"
5009,EXTRACT,"Took the form of a tune light and gay,"
5010,EXTRACT,And I knew I needn't fear evil
5011,EXTRACT,From one who could whistle that way.
5012,EXTRACT,
5013,EXTRACT,"Very soon I heard footsteps approaching,"
5014,EXTRACT,"Then came a peculiar dull thump,"
5015,EXTRACT,As if some one was heavily striking
5016,EXTRACT,An ax in the top of a stump;
5017,EXTRACT,"And then, in another brief moment,"
5018,EXTRACT,"There came a light tap on the door,"
5019,EXTRACT,"When quickly I undid the fast'ning,"
5020,EXTRACT,"And in stepped a boy, and before"
5021,EXTRACT,
5022,EXTRACT,There was either a question or answer
5023,EXTRACT,"Or either had time to speak,"
5024,EXTRACT,"I just threw my glad arms around him,"
5025,EXTRACT,And gave him a kiss on the cheek.
5026,EXTRACT,"Then I started back, scared at my boldness."
5027,EXTRACT,"But he only smiled at my fright,"
5028,EXTRACT,"As he said, ""I'm your neighbor's boy, Ellick,"
5029,EXTRACT,Come to tarry with you through the night.
5030,EXTRACT,
5031,EXTRACT,"""We saw your husband go eastward,"
5032,EXTRACT,"And made up our minds where he'd gone,"
5033,EXTRACT,"And I said to the rest of our people,"
5034,EXTRACT,"'That woman is there all alone,"
5035,EXTRACT,"And I venture she's awfully lonesome,"
5036,EXTRACT,"And though she may have no great fear,"
5037,EXTRACT,I think she would feel a bit safer
5038,EXTRACT,If only a boy were but near.'
5039,EXTRACT,
5040,EXTRACT,"""So, taking my axe on my shoulder,"
5041,EXTRACT,For fear that a savage might stray
5042,EXTRACT,"Across my path and need scalping,"
5043,EXTRACT,I started right down this way;
5044,EXTRACT,"And coming in sight of the cabin,"
5045,EXTRACT,"And thinking to save you alarm,"
5046,EXTRACT,"I whistled a tune, just to show you"
5047,EXTRACT,I didn't intend any harm.
5048,EXTRACT,
5049,EXTRACT,"""And so here I am, at your service;"
5050,EXTRACT,"But if you don't want me to stay,"
5051,EXTRACT,"Why, all you need do is to say so,"
5052,EXTRACT,"And should'ring my axe, I'll away."""
5053,EXTRACT,"I dropped in a chair and near fainted,"
5054,EXTRACT,"Just at thought of his leaving me then,"
5055,EXTRACT,And his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle
5056,EXTRACT,"As he said, ""I guess I'll remain."""
5057,EXTRACT,
5058,EXTRACT,And then I just sat there and told him
5059,EXTRACT,"How terribly frightened I'd been,"
5060,EXTRACT,How his face was to me the most welcome
5061,EXTRACT,Of any I ever had seen;
5062,EXTRACT,"And then I lay down with the baby,"
5063,EXTRACT,"And slept all the blessed night through,"
5064,EXTRACT,For I felt I was safe from all danger
5065,EXTRACT,"Near so brave a young fellow, and true."
5066,EXTRACT,
5067,EXTRACT,"So now, my dear friend, do you wonder,"
5068,EXTRACT,"Since such a good reason I've given,"
5069,EXTRACT,"Why I say I sha'n't care for the music,"
5070,EXTRACT,Unless there is whistling in heaven?
5071,EXTRACT,"Yes, often I've said so in earnest,"

5118,EXTRACT,"It flooded the crimson twilight,"
5119,EXTRACT,Like the close of an angel's psalm;

5121,EXTRACT,With a touch of infinite calm.
5122,EXTRACT,
5123,EXTRACT,"It quieted pain and sorrow,"
5124,EXTRACT,Like love overcoming strife;
5125,EXTRACT,It seemed the harmonious echo
5126,EXTRACT,From our discordant life.
5127,EXTRACT,
5128,EXTRACT,It linked all perplexing meanings
5129,EXTRACT,"Into one perfect peace,"
5130,EXTRACT,And trembled away into silence
5131,EXTRACT,As if it were loth to cease.
5132,EXTRACT,
5133,EXTRACT,"I have sought, but I seek it vainly,"
5134,EXTRACT,"That one lost chord divine,"
5135,EXTRACT,"That came from the soul of the organ,"
5136,EXTRACT,And entered into mine.
5137,EXTRACT,
5138,EXTRACT,It may be that Death's bright angel
5139,EXTRACT,Will speak in that chord again;
5140,EXTRACT,It may be that only in Heaven

5582,FINALE,The Green Mountain Justice
5583,FINALE,
5584,FINALE,
5585,FINALE,"""The snow is deep,"" the Justice said;"
5586,FINALE,"""There's mighty mischief overhead."""
5587,FINALE,"""High talk, indeed!"" his wife exclaimed;"
5588,FINALE,"""What, sir! shall Providence be blamed?"""
5589,FINALE,"The Justice, laughing, said, ""Oh no!"
5590,FINALE,I only meant the loads of snow
5591,FINALE,Upon the roofs. The barn is weak;
5592,FINALE,I greatly fear the roof will break.
5593,FINALE,"So hand me up the spade, my dear,"
5594,FINALE,"I'll mount the barn, the roof to clear."""
5595,FINALE,"""No!"" said the wife; ""the barn is high,"
5596,FINALE,"And if you slip, and fall, and die,"
5597,FINALE,How will my living be secured?--
5598,FINALE,"Stephen, your life is not insured."
5599,FINALE,"But tie a rope your waist around,"
5600,FINALE,"And it will hold you safe and sound."""
5601,FINALE,"""I will,"" said he. ""Now for the roof--"
5602,FINALE,"All snugly tied, and danger-proof!"
5603,FINALE,Excelsior! Excel--But no!
5604,FINALE,"The rope is not secured below!"""
5605,FINALE,"Said Rachel, ""Climb, the end to throw"
5606,FINALE,"Across the top, and I will go"
5607,FINALE,"And tie that end around my waist."""
5608,FINALE,"""Well, every woman to her taste;"
5609,FINALE,You always would be tightly laced.
5610,FINALE,"Rachel, when you became my bride,"
5611,FINALE,I thought the knot securely tied;
5612,FINALE,"But lest the bond should break in twain,"
5613,FINALE,"I'll have it fastened once again."""
5614,FINALE,"Below the arm-pits tied around,"
5615,FINALE,"She takes her station on the ground,"
5616,FINALE,"While on the roof, beyond the ridge,"
5617,FINALE,He shovels clear the lower edge.
5618,FINALE,"But, sad mischance! the loosened snow"
5619,FINALE,"Comes sliding down, to plunge below."
5620,FINALE,"And as he tumbles with the slide,"
5621,FINALE,Up Rachel goes on t'other side.
5622,FINALE,Just half-way down the Justice hung;
5623,FINALE,Just half-way up the woman swung.
5624,FINALE,"""Good land o' Goshen!"" shouted she;"
5625,FINALE,"""Why, do you see it?"" answered he."
5626,FINALE,
5627,FINALE,"The couple, dangling in the breeze,"
5628,FINALE,"Like turkeys hung outside to freeze,"
5629,FINALE,"At their rope's end and wits' end, too,"
5630,FINALE,Shout back and forth what best to do.
5631,FINALE,"Cried Stephen, ""Take it coolly, wife;"
5632,FINALE,"All have their ups and downs in life."""
5633,FINALE,"Quoth Rachel, ""What a pity 'tis"
5634,FINALE,To joke at such a thing as this!
5635,FINALE,A man whose wife is being hung
5636,FINALE,"Should know enough to hold his tongue."""
5637,FINALE,"""Now, Rachel, as I look below,"
5638,FINALE,I see a tempting heap of snow.
5639,FINALE,"Suppose, my dear, I take my knife,"
5640,FINALE,"And cut the rope to save my life?"""
5641,FINALE,"She shouted, ""Don't! 'twould be my death--"
5642,FINALE,I see some pointed stones beneath.
5643,FINALE,"A better way would be to call,"
5644,FINALE,"With all our might, for Phebe Hall."""
5645,FINALE,"""Agreed!"" he roared. First he, then she"
5646,FINALE,"Gave tongue; ""O Phebe! Phebe! _Phe-e-be_ Hall!"" in tones both fine"
5647,FINALE,and coarse.
5648,FINALE,Enough to make a drover hoarse.
5649,FINALE,
5650,FINALE,"Now Phebe, over at the farm,"
5651,FINALE,"Was sitting, sewing, snug and warm;"
5652,FINALE,"But hearing, as she thought, her name,"
5653,FINALE,"Sprang up, and to the rescue came;"
5654,FINALE,"Beheld the scene, and thus she thought:"
5655,FINALE,"""If now a kitchen chair were brought,"
5656,FINALE,"And I could reach the lady's foot,"
5657,FINALE,"I'd draw her downward by the boot,"
5658,FINALE,"Then cut the rope, and let him go;"
5659,FINALE,"He cannot miss the pile of snow."""
5660,FINALE,He sees her moving toward his wife.
5661,FINALE,"Armed with a chair and carving-knife,"
5662,FINALE,"And, ere he is aware, perceives"
5663,FINALE,His head ascending to the eaves;
5664,FINALE,"And, guessing what the two are at,"
5665,FINALE,"Screams from beneath the roof, ""Stop that!"
5666,FINALE,"You make me fall too far, by half!"""
5667,FINALE,"But Phebe answers, with a laugh,"
5668,FINALE,"""Please tell a body by what right"
5669,FINALE,"You've brought your wife to such a plight!"""
5670,FINALE,"And then, with well-directed blows,"
5671,FINALE,She cuts the rope and down he goes.
5672,FINALE,"The wife untied, they walk around"
5673,FINALE,When lo! no Stephen can be found.
5674,FINALE,"They call in vain, run to and fro;"
5675,FINALE,"They look around, above, below;"
5676,FINALE,"No trace or token can they see,"
5677,FINALE,And deeper grows the mystery.
5678,FINALE,Then Rachel's heart within her sank;
5679,FINALE,"But, glancing at the snowy bank,"
5680,FINALE,"She caught a little gleam of hope,--"
5681,FINALE,A gentle movement of the rope.
5682,FINALE,They scrape away a little snow;
5683,FINALE,What's this? A hat! Ah! he's below;
5684,FINALE,"Then upward heaves the snowy pile,"
5685,FINALE,"And forth he stalks in tragic style,"
5686,FINALE,"Unhurt, and with a roguish smile;"
5687,FINALE,"And Rachel sees, with glad surprise,"
5688,FINALE,"The missing found, the fallen rise."

5694,FINALE,
5695,FINALE,Jane Conquest
5696,FINALE,
5697,FINALE,
5698,FINALE,About the time of Christmas
5699,FINALE,"(Not many months ago),"
5700,FINALE,When the sky was black
5701,FINALE,"With wrath and rack,"
5702,FINALE,"And the earth was white with snow,"
5703,FINALE,When loudly rang the tumult
5704,FINALE,"Of winds and waves of strife,"
5705,FINALE,"In her home by the sea,"
5706,FINALE,"With her babe on her knee,"
5707,FINALE,Sat Harry Conquest's wife.
5708,FINALE,
5709,FINALE,"And he was on the ocean,"
5710,FINALE,"Although she knew not where,"
5711,FINALE,For never a lip
5712,FINALE,"Could tell of the ship,"
5713,FINALE,To lighten her heart's despair.
5714,FINALE,And her babe was fading and dying;
5715,FINALE,The pulse in the tiny wrist
5716,FINALE,"Was all but still,"
5717,FINALE,"And the brow was chill,"
5718,FINALE,And pale as the white sea mist.
5719,FINALE,
5720,FINALE,Jane Conquest's heart was hopeless;
5721,FINALE,She could only weep and pray
5722,FINALE,That the Shepherd mild
5723,FINALE,Would take her child
5724,FINALE,Without a pain away.
5725,FINALE,"The night was dark and darker,"
5726,FINALE,"And the storm grew stronger still,"
5727,FINALE,And buried in deep
5728,FINALE,And dreamless sleep
5729,FINALE,Lay the hamlet under the hill.
5730,FINALE,
5731,FINALE,The fire was dead on the hearthstone
5732,FINALE,"Within Jane Conquest's room,"
5733,FINALE,"And still sat she,"
5734,FINALE,"With her babe on her knee,"
5735,FINALE,At prayer amid the gloom.
5736,FINALE,"When, borne above the tempest,"
5737,FINALE,"A sound fell on her ear,"
5738,FINALE,"Thrilling her through,"
5739,FINALE,For well she knew
5740,FINALE,'Twas the voice of mortal fear.
5741,FINALE,
5742,FINALE,"And a light leaped in at the lattice,"
5743,FINALE,Sudden and swift and red;
5744,FINALE,"Crimsoning all,"
5745,FINALE,"The whited wall,"
5746,FINALE,"And the floor, and the roof o'erhead."
5747,FINALE,"For one brief moment, heedless"
5748,FINALE,"Of the babe upon her knee,"
5749,FINALE,With the frenzied start
5750,FINALE,"Of a frightened heart,"
5751,FINALE,Upon her feet rose she.
5752,FINALE,
5753,FINALE,And through the quaint old casement
5754,FINALE,She looks upon the sea;
5755,FINALE,Thank God that the sight
5756,FINALE,She saw that night
5757,FINALE,So rare a sight should be!
5758,FINALE,Hemmed in by many a billow
5759,FINALE,"With mad and foaming lip,"
5760,FINALE,"A mile from shore,"
5761,FINALE,"Or hardly more,"
5762,FINALE,She saw a gallant ship.
5763,FINALE,
5764,FINALE,And to her horror she beheld it
5765,FINALE,Aflame from stem to stern;
5766,FINALE,For there seemed no speck
5767,FINALE,On all that wreck
5768,FINALE,Where the fierce fire did not burn;
5769,FINALE,"Till the night was like a sunset,"
5770,FINALE,"And the sea like a sea of blood,"
5771,FINALE,And the rocks and shore
5772,FINALE,Were bathed all o'er
5773,FINALE,And drenched with the gory flood.
5774,FINALE,
5775,FINALE,"She looked and looked, till the terror"
5776,FINALE,Went creeping through every limb;
5777,FINALE,"And her breath came quick,"
5778,FINALE,"And her heart grew sick,"
5779,FINALE,And her sight grew dizzy and dim;
5780,FINALE,"And her lips had lost their utterance,"
5781,FINALE,For she tried but could not speak;
5782,FINALE,And her feelings found
5783,FINALE,No channel of sound
5784,FINALE,"In prayer, or sob, or shriek."
5785,FINALE,
5786,FINALE,Once more that cry of anguish
5787,FINALE,"Thrilled through the tempest's strife,"
5788,FINALE,And it stirred again
5789,FINALE,In heart and brain
5790,FINALE,The active thinking life;
5791,FINALE,And the light of an inspiration
5792,FINALE,"Leaped to her brightened eye,"
5793,FINALE,And on lip and brow
5794,FINALE,Was written now
5795,FINALE,A purpose pure and high.
5796,FINALE,
5797,FINALE,"Swiftly she turns, and softly"
5798,FINALE,"She crosses the chamber floor,"
5799,FINALE,"And faltering not,"
5800,FINALE,In his tiny cot
5801,FINALE,She laid the babe she bore.
5802,FINALE,"And then with a holy impulse,"
5803,FINALE,"She sank to her knees, and made"
5804,FINALE,"A lowly prayer,"
5805,FINALE,"In the silence there,"
5806,FINALE,And this was the prayer she prayed:
5807,FINALE,
5808,FINALE,"""O Christ, who didst bear the scourging,"
5809,FINALE,"And who now dost wear the crown,"
5810,FINALE,"I at Thy feet,"
5811,FINALE,"O True and Sweet,"
5812,FINALE,Would lay my burden down.
5813,FINALE,Thou bad'st me love and cherish
5814,FINALE,"The babe Thou gavest me,"
5815,FINALE,And I have kept
5816,FINALE,"Thy word, nor stept"
5817,FINALE,Aside from following Thee.
5818,FINALE,
5819,FINALE,"""And lo! my boy is dying!"
5820,FINALE,And vain is all my care;
5821,FINALE,And my burden's weight
5822,FINALE,"Is very great,"
5823,FINALE,"Yea, greater than I can bear!"
5824,FINALE,"O Lord, Thou know'st what peril"
5825,FINALE,"Doth threat these poor men's lives,"
5826,FINALE,"And I, a woman,"
5827,FINALE,"Most weak and human,"
5828,FINALE,Do plead for their waiting wives.
5829,FINALE,
5830,FINALE,"""Thou canst not let them perish;"
5831,FINALE,"Up, Lord, in Thy strength, and save"
5832,FINALE,From the scorching breath
5833,FINALE,Of this terrible death
5834,FINALE,On this cruel winter wave.
5835,FINALE,"Take Thou my babe and watch it,"
5836,FINALE,No care is like to Thine;
5837,FINALE,And let Thy power
5838,FINALE,In this perilous hour
5839,FINALE,"Supply what lack is mine."""
5840,FINALE,
5841,FINALE,"And so her prayer she ended,"
5842,FINALE,"And rising to her feet,"
5843,FINALE,Gave one long look
5844,FINALE,At the cradle nook
5845,FINALE,Where the child's faint pulses beat;
5846,FINALE,And then with softest footsteps
5847,FINALE,"Retrod the chamber floor,"
5848,FINALE,And noiselessly groped
5849,FINALE,"For the latch, and oped,"
5850,FINALE,And crossed the cottage door.
5851,FINALE,
5852,FINALE,And through the tempest bravely
5853,FINALE,"Jane Conquest fought her way,"
5854,FINALE,By snowy deep
5855,FINALE,And slippery steep
5856,FINALE,To where her duty lay.
5857,FINALE,"And she journeyed onward, breathless,"
5858,FINALE,"And weary and sore and faint,"
5859,FINALE,Yet forward pressed
5860,FINALE,"With the strength, and the zest,"
5861,FINALE,And the ardor of a saint.
5862,FINALE,
5863,FINALE,"Solemn, and weird, and lonely"
5864,FINALE,"Amid its countless graves,"
5865,FINALE,Stood the old gray church
5866,FINALE,"On its tall rock perch,"
5867,FINALE,Secure from the sea and its waves;
5868,FINALE,And beneath its sacred shadow
5869,FINALE,Lay the hamlet safe and still;
5870,FINALE,For however the sea
5871,FINALE,"And the wind might be,"
5872,FINALE,There was quiet under the hill.
5873,FINALE,
5874,FINALE,"Jane Conquest reached the churchyard,"
5875,FINALE,"And stood by the old church door,"
5876,FINALE,But the oak was tough
5877,FINALE,"And had bolts enough,"
5878,FINALE,And her strength was frail and poor;
5879,FINALE,"So she crept through a narrow window,"
5880,FINALE,"And climbed the belfry stair,"
5881,FINALE,"And grasped the rope,"
5882,FINALE,"Sole cord of hope,"
5883,FINALE,For the mariners in despair.
5884,FINALE,
5885,FINALE,"And the wild wind helped her bravely,"
5886,FINALE,"And she wrought with an earnest will,"
5887,FINALE,And the clamorous bell
5888,FINALE,Spoke out right well
5889,FINALE,To the hamlet under the hill.
5890,FINALE,"And it roused the slumbering fishers,"
5891,FINALE,Nor its warning task gave o'er
5892,FINALE,Till a hundred fleet
5893,FINALE,And eager feet
5894,FINALE,Were hurrying to the shore.
5895,FINALE,
5896,FINALE,"And then it ceased its ringing,"
5897,FINALE,"For the woman's work was done,"
5898,FINALE,And many a boat
5899,FINALE,That was now afloat
5900,FINALE,Showed man's work had begun.
5901,FINALE,But the ringer in the belfry
5902,FINALE,"Lay motionless and cold,"
5903,FINALE,With the cord of hope.
5904,FINALE,"The church-bell rope,"
5905,FINALE,Still in her frozen hold.
5906,FINALE,
5907,FINALE,"How long she lay it boots not,"
5908,FINALE,But she woke from her swoon at last
5909,FINALE,In her own bright room.
5910,FINALE,"To find the gloom,"
5911,FINALE,"And the grief, and the peril past,"
5912,FINALE,"With the sense of joy within her,"
5913,FINALE,And the Christ's sweet presence near;
5914,FINALE,"And friends around,"
5915,FINALE,And the cooing sound
5916,FINALE,Of her babe's voice in her ear.
5917,FINALE,
5918,FINALE,"And they told her all the story,"
5919,FINALE,How a brave and gallant few
5920,FINALE,"O'ercame each check,"
5921,FINALE,"And reached the wreck,"
5922,FINALE,And saved the hopeless crew.
5923,FINALE,And how the curious sexton
5924,FINALE,"Had climbed the belfry stair,"
5925,FINALE,And of his fright
5926,FINALE,"When, cold and white,"
5927,FINALE,He found her lying there;
5928,FINALE,
5929,FINALE,"And how, when they had borne her"
5930,FINALE,"Back to her home again,"
5931,FINALE,The child she left
5932,FINALE,With a heart bereft
5933,FINALE,"Of hope, and weary with pain,"
5934,FINALE,Was found within his cradle
5935,FINALE,In a quiet slumber laid;
5936,FINALE,With a peaceful smile
5937,FINALE,"On his lips the while,"
5938,FINALE,And the wasting sickness stayed.
5939,FINALE,
5940,FINALE,"And she said ""Twas the Christ who watched it,"
5941,FINALE,"And brought it safely through"";"
5942,FINALE,And she praised His truth
5943,FINALE,And His tender ruth
5944,FINALE,Who had saved her darling too.

5951,FINALE,
5952,FINALE,"To drum beat and heart beat,"
5953,FINALE,"A soldier marches by,"
5954,FINALE,"There is color in his cheek,"
5955,FINALE,There is courage in his eye;
5956,FINALE,"Yet to drum beat and heart beat,"
5957,FINALE,In a moment he must die.
5958,FINALE,
5959,FINALE,"By starlight and moonlight,"
5960,FINALE,He seeks the Britons' camp;
5961,FINALE,"He hears the rustling flag,"
5962,FINALE,And the armed sentry's tramp;
5963,FINALE,And the starlight and moonlight
5964,FINALE,His silent wanderings lamp.
5965,FINALE,
5966,FINALE,"With a slow tread and still tread,"
5967,FINALE,"He scans the tented line,"
5968,FINALE,And he counts the battery guns
5969,FINALE,"By the gaunt and shadowy pine,"
5970,FINALE,And his slow tread and still tread
5971,FINALE,Gives no warning sign.
5972,FINALE,
5973,FINALE,"The dark wave, the plumed wave,"
5974,FINALE,It meets his eager glance;
5975,FINALE,"And it sparkles 'neath the stars,"
5976,FINALE,Like the glimmer of a lance--
5977,FINALE,"A dark wave, a plumed wave,"
5978,FINALE,On an emerald expanse.
5979,FINALE,
5980,FINALE,"A sharp clang, a steel clang,"
5981,FINALE,And terror in the sound!
5982,FINALE,"For the sentry, falcon-eyed,"
5983,FINALE,In the camp a spy has found;
5984,FINALE,"With a sharp clang, a steel clang,"
5985,FINALE,The patriot is bound.
5986,FINALE,
5987,FINALE,"With calm brow, steady brow,"
5988,FINALE,He listens to his doom.
5989,FINALE,"In his look there is no fear,"
5990,FINALE,"Nor a shadow trace of gloom,"
5991,FINALE,"But with calm brow, steady brow,"
5992,FINALE,He robes him for the tomb.
5993,FINALE,
5994,FINALE,"In the long night, the still night,"
5995,FINALE,He kneels upon the sod;
5996,FINALE,And the brutal guards withhold
5997,FINALE,E'en the solemn word of God!
5998,FINALE,"In the long night, the still night,"
5999,FINALE,He walks where Christ hath trod.
6000,FINALE,
6001,FINALE,"'Neath the blue morn, the sunny morn,"
6002,FINALE,He dies upon the tree;
6003,FINALE,And he mourns that he can give
6004,FINALE,But one life for liberty;
6005,FINALE,"And in the blue morn, the sunny morn"
6006,FINALE,His spent wings are free.
6007,FINALE,
6008,FINALE,"But his last words, his message words,"
6009,FINALE,"They burn, lest friendly eye"
6010,FINALE,Should read how proud and calm
6011,FINALE,A patriot could die.
6012,FINALE,"With his last words, his dying words,"
6013,FINALE,A soldier's battle cry.
6014,FINALE,
6015,FINALE,"From Fame-leaf and Angel-leaf,"
6016,FINALE,"From monument and urn,"
6017,FINALE,"The sad of earth, the glad of Heaven,"
6018,FINALE,His tragic fate shall learn;
6019,FINALE,"And on Fame-leaf and Angel-leaf,"
6020,FINALE,The name of Hale shall burn.

6029,FINALE,
6030,FINALE,"You are coming to woo me, but not as of yore,"
6031,FINALE,When I hastened to welcome your ring at the door;
6032,FINALE,"For I trusted that he who stood waiting me then,"
6033,FINALE,"Was the brightest, the truest, the noblest of men."
6034,FINALE,"Your lips on my own when they printed ""Farewell,"""
6035,FINALE,"Had never been soiled by ""the beverage of hell"";"
6036,FINALE,"But they come to me now with the bacchanal sign,"
6037,FINALE,And the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine.
6038,FINALE,
6039,FINALE,"I think of that night in the garden alone,"
6040,FINALE,"When in whispers you told me your heart was my own,"
6041,FINALE,That your love in the future should faithfully be
6042,FINALE,"Unshared by another, kept only for me."

6044,FINALE,"Of the lips which met mine, when they murmured ""I will"";"
6045,FINALE,"But now to their pressure no more they incline,"

6047,FINALE,
6048,FINALE,"O John! how it crushed me, when first in your face"
6049,FINALE,"The pen of the ""Rum Fiend"" had written ""disgrace"";"
6050,FINALE,And turned me in silence and tears from that breath
6051,FINALE,All poisoned and foul from the chalice of death.
6052,FINALE,It scattered the hopes I had treasured to last;
6053,FINALE,It darkened the future and clouded the past;
6054,FINALE,"It shattered my idol, and ruined the shrine,"
6055,FINALE,For the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine.
6056,FINALE,
6057,FINALE,"I loved you--Oh, dearer than language can tell,"
6058,FINALE,"And you saw it, you proved it, you knew it too well!"
6059,FINALE,But the man of my love was far other than he
6060,FINALE,"Who now from the ""Tap-room"" comes reeling to me;"
6061,FINALE,In manhood and honor so noble and right--
6062,FINALE,"His heart was so true, and his genius so bright--"
6063,FINALE,"And his soul was unstained, unpolluted by wine;"
6064,FINALE,But the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine.
6065,FINALE,
6066,FINALE,"You promised reform, but I trusted in vain;"
6067,FINALE,Your pledge was but made to be broken again:
6068,FINALE,"And the lover so false to his promises now,"
6069,FINALE,"Will not, as a husband, be true to his vow."
6070,FINALE,The word must be spoken that bids you depart--
6071,FINALE,Though the effort to speak it should shatter my heart--
6072,FINALE,"Though in silence, with blighted affection, I pine,"
6073,FINALE,Yet the lips that touch liquor must never touch mine!
6074,FINALE,
6075,FINALE,"If one spark in your bosom of virtue remain,"
6076,FINALE,Go fan it with prayer till it kindle again;
6077,FINALE,"Resolved, with ""God helping,"" in future to be"
6078,FINALE,From wine and its follies unshackled and free!
6079,FINALE,"And when you have conquered this foe of your soul,--"
6080,FINALE,In manhood and honor beyond his control--
6081,FINALE,"This heart will again beat responsive to thine,"
6082,FINALE,And the lips free from liquor be welcome to mine.

6117,FINALE,
6118,FINALE,Kate Ketchem on a winter's night
6119,FINALE,Went to a party dressed in white.
6120,FINALE,"Her chignon in a net of gold,"
6121,FINALE,Was about as large as they ever sold.
6122,FINALE,"Gayly she went, because her ""pap"""
6123,FINALE,Was supposed to be a rich old chap.
6124,FINALE,
6125,FINALE,But when by chance her glances fell
6126,FINALE,"On a friend who had lately married well,"
6127,FINALE,"Her spirits sunk, and a vague unrest"
6128,FINALE,And a nameless longing filled her breast--
6129,FINALE,"A wish she wouldn't have had made known,"
6130,FINALE,To have an establishment of her own.
6131,FINALE,
6132,FINALE,"Tom Fudge came slowly through the throng,"
6133,FINALE,"With chestnut hair, worn pretty long."
6134,FINALE,"He saw Kate Ketchem in the crowd,"
6135,FINALE,"And knowing her slightly, stopped and bowed;"
6136,FINALE,"Then asked her to give him a single flower,"
6137,FINALE,Saying he'd think it a priceless dower.
6138,FINALE,
6139,FINALE,"Out from those with which she was decked,"
6140,FINALE,She took the poorest she could select.
6141,FINALE,"And blushed as she gave it, looking down"
6142,FINALE,To call attention to her gown.
6143,FINALE,"""Thanks,"" said Fudge, and he thought how dear"
6144,FINALE,Flowers must be at that time of year.
6145,FINALE,
6146,FINALE,"Then several charming remarks he made,"
6147,FINALE,"Asked if she sang, or danced, or played;"
6148,FINALE,"And being exhausted, inquired whether"
6149,FINALE,She thought it was going to be pleasant weather.
6150,FINALE,"And Kate displayed her ""jewelry,"""
6151,FINALE,And dropped her lashes becomingly;
6152,FINALE,"And listened, with no attempt to disguise"
6153,FINALE,The admiration in her eyes.
6154,FINALE,"At last, like one who has nothing to say,"
6155,FINALE,He turned around and walked away.
6156,FINALE,
6157,FINALE,"Kate Ketchem smiled, and said, ""You bet."
6158,FINALE,I'll catch that Fudge and his money yet.
6159,FINALE,"He's rich enough to keep me in clothes,"
6160,FINALE,And I think I could manage him as I chose.
6161,FINALE,"He could aid my father as well as not,"
6162,FINALE,And buy my brother a splendid yacht.
6163,FINALE,"My mother for money should never fret,"
6164,FINALE,And all it cried for the baby should get;
6165,FINALE,"And after that, with what he could spare,"
6166,FINALE,"I'd make a show at a charity fair."""
6167,FINALE,
6168,FINALE,"Tom Fudge looked back as he crossed the sill,"
6169,FINALE,And saw Kate Ketchem standing still.
6170,FINALE,"""A girl more suited to my mind"
6171,FINALE,It isn't an easy thing to find;
6172,FINALE,And every thing that she has to wear
6173,FINALE,Proves her as rich as she is fair.
6174,FINALE,"Would she were mine, and I to-day"
6175,FINALE,Had the old man's cash my debts to pay!
6176,FINALE,"No creditors with a long account,"
6177,FINALE,No tradesmen wanting 'that little amount';
6178,FINALE,But all my scores paid up when due
6179,FINALE,"By a father-in-law as rich as a Jew!"""
6180,FINALE,
6181,FINALE,"But he thought of her brother, not worth a straw,"
6182,FINALE,"And her mother, that would be his, in law;"
6183,FINALE,"So, undecided, he walked along,"
6184,FINALE,And Kate was left alone in the throng.
6185,FINALE,"But a lawyer smiled, whom he sought by stealth,"
6186,FINALE,To ascertain old Ketchem's wealth;
6187,FINALE,"And as for Kate, she schemed and planned"
6188,FINALE,Till one of the dancers claimed her hand.
6189,FINALE,
6190,FINALE,He married her for her father's cash;
6191,FINALE,"She married him to cut a dash,"
6192,FINALE,"But as to paying his debts, do you know,"
6193,FINALE,The father couldn't see it so;
6194,FINALE,"And at hints for help, Kate's hazel eyes"
6195,FINALE,Looked out in their innocent surprise.
6196,FINALE,And when Tom thought of the way he had wed
6197,FINALE,"He longed for a single life instead,"
6198,FINALE,"And closed his eyes in a sulky mood,"
6199,FINALE,Regretting the days of his bachelorhood;
6200,FINALE,"And said, in a sort of reckless vein,"
6201,FINALE,"""I'd like to see her catch me again,"
6202,FINALE,"If I were free, as on that night"
6203,FINALE,"When I saw Kate Ketchem dressed in white!"""
6204,FINALE,
6205,FINALE,She wedded him to be rich and gay;
6206,FINALE,"But husband and children didn't pay,"
6207,FINALE,"He wasn't the prize she hoped to draw,"
6208,FINALE,And wouldn't live with his mother-in-law.
6209,FINALE,And oft when she had to coax and pout
6210,FINALE,"In order to get him to take her out,"
6211,FINALE,She thought how very attentive and bright
6212,FINALE,He seemed at the party that winter's night;
6213,FINALE,"Of his laugh, as soft as a breeze of the south,"
6214,FINALE,('Twas now on the other side of his mouth);
6215,FINALE,"How he praised her dress and gems in his talk,"
6216,FINALE,As he took a careful account of stock.
6217,FINALE,
6218,FINALE,Sometimes she hated the very walls--
6219,FINALE,"Hated her friends, her dinners, and calls;"
6220,FINALE,"Till her weak affection, to hatred turned,"
6221,FINALE,Like a dying tallow-candle burned.
6222,FINALE,"And for him who sat there, her peace to mar,"
6223,FINALE,Smoking his everlasting cigar--
6224,FINALE,"He wasn't the man she thought she saw,"
6225,FINALE,"And grief was duty, and hate was law."
6226,FINALE,"So she took up her burden with a groan,"
6227,FINALE,"Saying only, ""I might have known!"""
6228,FINALE,
6229,FINALE,Alas for Kate! and alas for Fudge!
6230,FINALE,Though I do not owe them any grudge;
6231,FINALE,And alas for any who find to their shame
6232,FINALE,That two can play at their little game!
6233,FINALE,"For of all hard things to bear and grin,"
6234,FINALE,The hardest is knowing you're taken in.
6235,FINALE,"Ah, well! as a general thing, we fret"
6236,FINALE,About the one we didn't get;
6237,FINALE,"But I think we needn't make a fuss,"
6238,FINALE,If the one we don't want didn't get us.

6562,FINALE,"The quiet aisles of prayer,"
6563,FINALE,Glad witness to your zeal for God
6564,FINALE,And love of man I bear.
6565,FINALE,
6566,FINALE,I trace your lines of argument;
6567,FINALE,Your logic linked and strong
6568,FINALE,"I weigh as one who dreads dissent,"
6569,FINALE,And fears a doubt as wrong.
6570,FINALE,
6571,FINALE,But still my human hands are weak
6572,FINALE,To hold your iron creeds:
6573,FINALE,Against the words ye bid me speak
6574,FINALE,My heart within me pleads.
6575,FINALE,
6576,FINALE,Who fathoms the Eternal Thought?
6577,FINALE,Who talks of scheme and plan?
6578,FINALE,The Lord is God! He needeth not

6580,FINALE,
6581,FINALE,"I walk with bare, hushed feet the ground"
6582,FINALE,Ye tread with boldness shod;
6583,FINALE,I dare not fix with mete and bound
6584,FINALE,The love and power of God.
6585,FINALE,
6586,FINALE,Ye praise His justice; even such
6587,FINALE,His pitying love I deem;
6588,FINALE,Ye seek a king; I fain would touch
6589,FINALE,The robe that hath no seam.
6590,FINALE,
6591,FINALE,Ye see the curse which overbroods
6592,FINALE,A world of pain and loss;

6607,FINALE,I feel the guilt within;
6608,FINALE,"I hear, with groan and travail-cries,"

6610,FINALE,
6611,FINALE,"Yet, in the maddening maze of things,"

6619,FINALE,Which evil is in me.
6620,FINALE,
6621,FINALE,The wrong that pains my soul below
6622,FINALE,I dare not throne above;
6623,FINALE,"I know not of His hate,--I know"
6624,FINALE,His goodness and His love.
6625,FINALE,
6626,FINALE,I dimly guess from blessings known
6627,FINALE,"Of greater out of sight,"
6628,FINALE,"And, with the chastened Psalmist, own"
6629,FINALE,His judgments too are right.
6630,FINALE,

6635,FINALE,
6636,FINALE,I know not what the future hath
6637,FINALE,"Of marvel or surprise,"
6638,FINALE,Assured alone that life and death
6639,FINALE,His mercy underlies.
6640,FINALE,
6641,FINALE,And if my heart and flesh are weak
6642,FINALE,"To bear an untried pain,"
6643,FINALE,"The bruised reed He will not break,"
6644,FINALE,But strengthen and sustain.
6645,FINALE,
6646,FINALE,"No offering of my own I have,"
6647,FINALE,Nor works my faith to prove;
6648,FINALE,"I can but give the gifts He gave,"
6649,FINALE,And plead His love for love.
6650,FINALE,
6651,FINALE,"And so beside the Silent Sea,"
6652,FINALE,I wait the muffled oar;
6653,FINALE,No harm from Him can come to me
6654,FINALE,On ocean or on shore.
6655,FINALE,
6656,FINALE,I know not where His islands lift
6657,FINALE,Their fronded palms in air;
6658,FINALE,I only know I cannot drift
6659,FINALE,Beyond His love and care.
6660,FINALE,
6661,FINALE,"O brothers! if my faith is vain,"
6662,FINALE,"If hopes like these betray,"
6663,FINALE,Pray for me that my feet may gain
6664,FINALE,The sure and safer way.
6665,FINALE,
6666,FINALE,"And Thou, O Lord! by whom are seen"
6667,FINALE,"Thy creatures as they be,"
6668,FINALE,Forgive me if too close I lean
6669,FINALE,My human heart on Thee!

6677,FINALE,
6678,FINALE,
6679,FINALE,Out of the clover and blue-eyed grass
6680,FINALE,He turned them into the river-lane;
6681,FINALE,One after another he let them pass.
6682,FINALE,Then fastened the meadow-bars again.
6683,FINALE,
6684,FINALE,"Under the willows and over the hill,"
6685,FINALE,He patiently followed their sober pace;
6686,FINALE,"The merry whistle for once was still,"
6687,FINALE,And something shadowed the sunny face.
6688,FINALE,
6689,FINALE,Only a boy! and his father had said
6690,FINALE,He never could let his youngest go;
6691,FINALE,Two already were lying dead
6692,FINALE,Under the feet of the trampling foe.
6693,FINALE,
6694,FINALE,"But after the evening work was done,"
6695,FINALE,"And the frogs were loud in the meadow swamp,"
6696,FINALE,"Over his shoulder he slung his gun,"
6697,FINALE,"And stealthily followed the footpath damp,--"
6698,FINALE,
6699,FINALE,Across the clover and through the wheat.
6700,FINALE,"With resolute heart and purpose grim,"
6701,FINALE,"Though cold was the dew on his hurrying feet,"
6702,FINALE,And the blind bat's flitting startled him.
6703,FINALE,
6704,FINALE,"Thrice since then had the lanes been white,"
6705,FINALE,And the orchards sweet with apple bloom;
6706,FINALE,"And now, when the cows came back at night,"
6707,FINALE,The feeble father drove them home.
6708,FINALE,
6709,FINALE,For news had come to the lonely farm
6710,FINALE,That three were lying where two had lain;
6711,FINALE,"And the old man's tremulous, palsied arm"
6712,FINALE,Could never lean on a son's again.
6713,FINALE,
6714,FINALE,The summer day grew cool and late;
6715,FINALE,He went for the cows when the work was done;
6716,FINALE,"But down the lane, as he opened the gate,"
6717,FINALE,"He saw them coming, one by one,--"
6718,FINALE,
6719,FINALE,"Brindle, Ebony, Speckle, and Bess,"
6720,FINALE,"Shaking their horns in the evening wind,"
6721,FINALE,Cropping the buttercups out of the grass--
6722,FINALE,But who was it following close behind?
6723,FINALE,
6724,FINALE,Loosely swung in the idle air
6725,FINALE,The empty sleeve of army blue;
6726,FINALE,"And worn and pale, from the crisping hair,"
6727,FINALE,Looked out a face that the father knew.
6728,FINALE,
6729,FINALE,"For southern prisons will sometimes yawn,"
6730,FINALE,And yield their dead unto life again;
6731,FINALE,And the day that comes with a cloudy dawn
6732,FINALE,In golden glory at last may wane.
6733,FINALE,
6734,FINALE,The great tears sprang to their meeting eyes;
6735,FINALE,"For the heart must speak when the lips are dumb,"
6736,FINALE,And under the silent evening skies
6737,FINALE,Together they followed the cattle home.

6912,FINALE,"Dead! Is it possible? He, the bold rider,"
6913,FINALE,"Custer, our hero, the first in the fight,"
6914,FINALE,"Charming the bullets of yore to fly wider,"
6915,FINALE,Shunning our battle-king's ringlets of light!
6916,FINALE,"Dead! our young chieftain, and dead all forsaken!"
6917,FINALE,No one to tell us the way of his fall!
6918,FINALE,"Slain in the desert, and never to waken,"
6919,FINALE,"Never, not even to victory's call!"
6920,FINALE,
6921,FINALE,"Comrades, he's gone! but ye need not be grieving;"
6922,FINALE,"No, may my death be like his when I die!"
6923,FINALE,"No regrets wasted on words I am leaving,"
6924,FINALE,"Falling with brave men, and face to the sky."

6929,FINALE,
6930,FINALE,Proud for his fame that last day that he met them!
6931,FINALE,"All the night long he had been on their track,"
6932,FINALE,"Scorning their traps and the men that had set them,"
6933,FINALE,Wild for a charge that should never give back.
6934,FINALE,"There, on the hilltop he halted and saw them--"
6935,FINALE,Lodges all loosened and ready to fly;
6936,FINALE,"Hurrying scouts with the tidings to awe them,"
6937,FINALE,Told of his coming before he was nigh.
6938,FINALE,
6939,FINALE,"All the wide valley was full of their forces,"
6940,FINALE,"Gathered to cover the lodges' retreat,--"
6941,FINALE,"Warriors running in haste to their horses,"
6942,FINALE,Thousands of enemies close to his feet!
6943,FINALE,"Down in the valleys the ages had hollowed,"
6944,FINALE,There lay the Sitting Bull's camp for a prey!
6945,FINALE,Numbers! What recked he? What recked those who followed?
6946,FINALE,Men who had fought ten to one ere that day?
6947,FINALE,
6948,FINALE,"Out swept the squadrons, the fated three hundred,"
6949,FINALE,Into the battle-line steady and full;
6950,FINALE,Then down the hillside exultingly thundered
6951,FINALE,Into the hordes of the Old Sitting Bull!
6952,FINALE,"Wild Ogalallah, Arapahoe, Cheyenne,"
6953,FINALE,"Wild Horse's braves, and the rest of their crew,"
6954,FINALE,Shrank from that charge like a herd from a lion.
6955,FINALE,Then closed around the great hell of wild Sioux.
6956,FINALE,
6957,FINALE,"Right to their center he charged, and then, facing--"
6958,FINALE,"Hark to those yells and around them, Oh, see!"
6959,FINALE,"Over the hilltops the devils come racing,"
6960,FINALE,Coming as fast as the waves of the sea!
6961,FINALE,"Red was the circle of fire about them,"
6962,FINALE,"No hope of victory, no ray of light,"
6963,FINALE,"Shot through that terrible black cloud about them,"
6964,FINALE,Brooding in death over Custer's last fight.
6965,FINALE,
6966,FINALE,"THEN DID HE BLENCH? Did he die like a craven,"
6967,FINALE,Begging those torturing fiends for his life?
6968,FINALE,Was there a soldier who carried the Seven
6969,FINALE,Flinched like a coward or fled from the strife?
6970,FINALE,"No, by the blood of our Custer, no quailing!"
6971,FINALE,"There in the midst of the devils they close,"
6972,FINALE,"Hemmed in by thousands, but ever assailing,"
6973,FINALE,"Fighting like tigers, all bayed amid foes!"
6974,FINALE,
6975,FINALE,Thicker and thicker the bullets came singing;
6976,FINALE,Down go the horses and riders and all;
6977,FINALE,"Swiftly the warriors round them were ringing,"
6978,FINALE,Circling like buzzards awaiting their fall.
6979,FINALE,"See the wild steeds of the mountain and prairie,"
6980,FINALE,Savage eyes gleaming from forests of mane;
6981,FINALE,Quivering lances with pennons so airy;
6982,FINALE,War-painted warriors charging amain.
6983,FINALE,
6984,FINALE,"Backward again and again they were driven,"
6985,FINALE,Shrinking to close with the lost little band;
6986,FINALE,Never a cap that had worn the bright Seven
6987,FINALE,Bowed till its wearer was dead on the strand.
6988,FINALE,"Closer and closer the death-circle growing,"
6989,FINALE,"Even the leader's voice, clarion clear,"
6990,FINALE,"Rang out his words of encouragement glowing,"
6991,FINALE,"""We can but die once, boys, but SELL YOUR LIVES DEAR!"""
6992,FINALE,
6993,FINALE,"Dearly they sold them, like Berserkers raging,"
6994,FINALE,Facing the death that encircled them round;
6995,FINALE,"Death's bitter pangs by their vengeance assuaging,"
6996,FINALE,Marking their tracks by their dead on the ground.
6997,FINALE,"Comrades, our children shall yet tell their story,--"

7152,FINALE,
7153,FINALE,She only came when on the cliffs
7154,FINALE,"The evening moonlight lay,"
7155,FINALE,And no man knew the secret haunts

7157,FINALE,

7167,FINALE,
7168,FINALE,But when the broad midsummer moon
7169,FINALE,"Rose o'er the grassy lawn,"

7171,FINALE,There grazed a spotted fawn.
7172,FINALE,

7187,FINALE,
7188,FINALE,"""I love to watch her as she feeds,"

7199,FINALE,"He ranged the wild in vain,"
7200,FINALE,"Nor roused the pheasant nor the deer,"
7201,FINALE,And wandered home again.
7202,FINALE,
7203,FINALE,The crescent moon and crimson eve
7204,FINALE,Shone with a mingling light;
7205,FINALE,"The deer, upon the grassy mead,"
7206,FINALE,Was feeding full in sight.
7207,FINALE,
7208,FINALE,"He raised the rifle to his eye,"
7209,FINALE,And from the cliffs around
7210,FINALE,"A sudden echo, shrill and sharp,"
7211,FINALE,Gave back its deadly sound.
7212,FINALE,
7213,FINALE,"Away, into the neighboring wood,"
7214,FINALE,"The startled creature flew,"

7216,FINALE,Amid the glimmering dew.
7217,FINALE,
7218,FINALE,Next evening shone the waxing moon

7226,FINALE,And slew the youth and dame.
7227,FINALE,

7371,FINALE,
7372,FINALE,"Week in, week out, from morn till night,"
7373,FINALE,You can hear his bellows blow;
7374,FINALE,"You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,"
7375,FINALE,"With measured beat and slow,"
7376,FINALE,"Like a sexton ringing the village bell,"
7377,FINALE,When the evening sun is low.
7378,FINALE,
7379,FINALE,And children coming home from school
7380,FINALE,Look in at the open door;

7384,FINALE,Like chaff from a threshing floor.
7385,FINALE,
7386,FINALE,"He goes on Sunday to the church,"
7387,FINALE,And sits among his boys;
7388,FINALE,"He hears the parson pray and preach,"
7389,FINALE,"He hears his daughter's voice,"
7390,FINALE,"Singing in the village choir,"
7391,FINALE,And it makes his heart rejoice.
7392,FINALE,
7393,FINALE,"It sounds to him like her mother's voice,"
7394,FINALE,Singing in Paradise!
7395,FINALE,"He needs must think of her once more,"
7396,FINALE,How in the grave she lies;
7397,FINALE,"And with his hard, rough hand he wipes"
7398,FINALE,A tear out of his eyes.
7399,FINALE,
7400,FINALE,"Toiling,--rejoicing,--sorrowing,"
7401,FINALE,Onward through life he goes;
7402,FINALE,"Each morning sees some task begun,"
7403,FINALE,Each evening sees it close;
7404,FINALE,"Something attempted, something done,"
7405,FINALE,Has earned a night's repose.
7406,FINALE,
7407,FINALE,"Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,"
7408,FINALE,For the lesson thou hast taught!
7409,FINALE,Thus at the flaming forge of life
7410,FINALE,Our fortunes must be wrought;
7411,FINALE,Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
7412,FINALE,Each burning deed and thought.

7527,FINALE,
7528,FINALE,
7529,FINALE,"The snow had begun in the gloaming,"
7530,FINALE,And busily all the night
7531,FINALE,Had been heaping field and highway
7532,FINALE,With a silence deep and white.
7533,FINALE,
7534,FINALE,Every pine and fir and hemlock
7535,FINALE,"Wore ermine too dear for an earl,"
7536,FINALE,And the poorest twig on the elm tree
7537,FINALE,Was ridged inch-deep with pearl.
7538,FINALE,
7539,FINALE,From sheds new-roofed with Carrara
7540,FINALE,"Came Chanticleer's muffled crow,"
7541,FINALE,"The stiff rails were softened to swan's-down,"
7542,FINALE,And still fluttered down the snow.
7543,FINALE,
7544,FINALE,I stood and watched by the window
7545,FINALE,"The noiseless work of the sky,"
7546,FINALE,"And the sudden flurries of snow-birds,"
7547,FINALE,Like brown leaves whirling by.
7548,FINALE,
7549,FINALE,I thought of a mound in sweet Auburn
7550,FINALE,Where a little headstone stood;
7551,FINALE,"How the flakes were folding it gently,"
7552,FINALE,As did robins the babes in the wood.
7553,FINALE,
7554,FINALE,"Up spoke our own little Mabel,"
7555,FINALE,"Saying, ""Father, who makes it snow?"""
7556,FINALE,And I told of the good All-father
7557,FINALE,Who cares for us here below.
7558,FINALE,
7559,FINALE,"Again I looked at the snow-fall,"
7560,FINALE,And thought of the leaden sky
7561,FINALE,"That arched o'er our first great sorrow,"
7562,FINALE,When that mound was heaped so high.
7563,FINALE,
7564,FINALE,I remembered the gradual patience
7565,FINALE,"That fell from that cloud like snow,"
7566,FINALE,"Flake by flake, healing and hiding"
7567,FINALE,The scar of our deep-plunged woe.
7568,FINALE,
7569,FINALE,"And again to the child I whispered,"
7570,FINALE,"""The snow that husheth all,"
7571,FINALE,"Darling, the merciful Father"
7572,FINALE,"Alone can make it fall!"""
7573,FINALE,
7574,FINALE,"Then, with eyes that saw not, I kissed her;"
7575,FINALE,"And she, kissing back, could not know"
7576,FINALE,"That _my_ kiss was given to her sister,"
7577,FINALE,Folded close under deepening snow.

7614,FINALE,Casey at the Bat
7615,FINALE,
7616,FINALE,
7617,FINALE,It looked extremely rocky for the Mudville nine that day;
7618,FINALE,The score stood two to four with but an inning left to play;
7619,FINALE,"So, when Cooney died at second, and Burrows did the same,"
7620,FINALE,A pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.
7621,FINALE,
7622,FINALE,"A straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,"
7623,FINALE,"With that hope which springs eternal within the human breast,"
7624,FINALE,"For they thought: ""If only Casey could get a whack at that,"""
7625,FINALE,"They'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat."
7626,FINALE,
7627,FINALE,"But Flynn preceded Casey, and likewise so did Blake,"
7628,FINALE,"And the former was a puddin', and the latter was a fake;"
7629,FINALE,So on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat.
7630,FINALE,"For there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat,"
7631,FINALE,
7632,FINALE,"But Flynn let drive a ""single,"" to the wonderment of all,"
7633,FINALE,"And the much-despised Blakey ""tore the cover off the ball"";"
7634,FINALE,"And when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred,"
7635,FINALE,"There was Blakey safe at second, and Flynn a-huggin' third."
7636,FINALE,
7637,FINALE,"Then, from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,"
7638,FINALE,"It rumbled in the mountain-tops, it rattled in the dell;"
7639,FINALE,It struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat;
7640,FINALE,"For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat."
7641,FINALE,
7642,FINALE,"There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place,"
7643,FINALE,"There was pride in Casey's bearing, and a smile on Casey's face."
7644,FINALE,"And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,"
7645,FINALE,No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.
7646,FINALE,
7647,FINALE,"Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,"
7648,FINALE,Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;
7649,FINALE,"Then while the New York pitcher ground the ball into his hip,"
7650,FINALE,"Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip."
7651,FINALE,
7652,FINALE,"And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,"
7653,FINALE,And Casey stood a-watching it in  haughty grandeur there.
7654,FINALE,Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped--
7655,FINALE,"""That ain't my style,"" said Casey. ""Strike one,"" the umpire said."
7656,FINALE,
7657,FINALE,"From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,"
7658,FINALE,Like the beating of great storm waves on a stern and distant shore.
7659,FINALE,"""Kill him! Kill the umpire!"" shouted someone on the stand."
7660,FINALE,And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised a hand.
7661,FINALE,
7662,FINALE,With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;
7663,FINALE,He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;
7664,FINALE,"He signaled to Sir Timothy, once more the spheroid flew;"
7665,FINALE,"But Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, ""Strike two."""
7666,FINALE,
7667,FINALE,"""Fraud,"" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered ""Fraud!"""
7668,FINALE,But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.
7669,FINALE,"They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,"
7670,FINALE,And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.
7671,FINALE,
7672,FINALE,"The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;"
7673,FINALE,He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;
7674,FINALE,"And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,"
7675,FINALE,And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.
7676,FINALE,
7677,FINALE,"Oh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;"
7678,FINALE,"The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;"
7679,FINALE,"And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout:"
7680,FINALE,But there is no joy in Mudville--mighty Casey has struck out.

7690,FINALE,
7691,FINALE,
7692,FINALE,There were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;
7693,FINALE,There were muttered oaths and curses--every fan in town was sore.
7694,FINALE,"""Just think,"" said one, ""how soft it looked with Casey at the bat!"
7695,FINALE,"And then to think he'd go and spring a bush league trick like that."""
7696,FINALE,
7697,FINALE,"All his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless ""shine."""
7698,FINALE,"They called him ""Strike-out Casey"" from the mayor down the line."
7699,FINALE,"And as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,"
7700,FINALE,While a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey's eye.
7701,FINALE,
7702,FINALE,"The lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again,"
7703,FINALE,"And Fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men."
7704,FINALE,And Casey smiled--his rugged face no longer wore a frown;
7705,FINALE,The pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.
7706,FINALE,
7707,FINALE,All Mudville has assembled; ten thousand fans had come
7708,FINALE,To see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;
7709,FINALE,And when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild.
7710,FINALE,He doffed his cap in proud disdain--but Casey only smiled.
7711,FINALE,
7712,FINALE,"""Play ball!"" the umpire's voice rang out, and then the game began;"
7713,FINALE,But in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan
7714,FINALE,Who thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun
7715,FINALE,"Their hopes sank low--the rival team was leading ""four to one."""
7716,FINALE,
7717,FINALE,"The last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;"
7718,FINALE,But when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.
7719,FINALE,"The din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard"
7720,FINALE,"When the pitcher hit the second and gave ""four balls"" to the third."
7721,FINALE,
7722,FINALE,Three men on base--nobody out--three runs to tie the game!
7723,FINALE,A triple meant the highest niche in Mudville's hall of fame.
7724,FINALE,But here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night
7725,FINALE,"When the fourth one ""fouled to catcher,"" and the fifth ""flew out to right."""
7726,FINALE,
7727,FINALE,A dismal groan in chorus came--a scowl was on each face--
7728,FINALE,"When Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;"
7729,FINALE,His bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate;
7730,FINALE,He gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.
7731,FINALE,
7732,FINALE,"But fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;"
7733,FINALE,"There were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day."
7734,FINALE,"They hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, ""Strike him out!"""
7735,FINALE,But Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard the shout.
7736,FINALE,
7737,FINALE,The pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread;
7738,FINALE,"Another hiss, another groan--""Strike one!"" the umpire said."
7739,FINALE,"Zip! Like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee--"
7740,FINALE,"""Strike two!"" the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea."
7741,FINALE,
7742,FINALE,No roasting for the umpire now--his was an easy lot.
7743,FINALE,But here the pitcher twirled again--was that a rifle shot?
7744,FINALE,A whack; a crack; and out through space the leather pellet flew--
7745,FINALE,"A blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue."
7746,FINALE,
7747,FINALE,"Above the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight"
7748,FINALE,The sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.
7749,FINALE,"Ten thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit;"
7750,FINALE,But no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit!
7751,FINALE,
7752,FINALE,"Oh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun,"
7753,FINALE,And somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun;
7754,FINALE,"And somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall,"
7755,FINALE,But Mudville hearts are happy now--for Casey hit the ball!

7806,FINALE,Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;
7807,FINALE,"Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--"

7830,FINALE,"To the trials of life, to thy heart as of yore;"
7831,FINALE,"Thou longest again for my fond loving care,"
7832,FINALE,"For my kiss on thy cheek, for my hand on thy hair;"

7845,FINALE,"Tired, my child, of the ""base, the untrue!"""

7879,FINALE,
7880,FINALE,"'Twas the last fight at Fredericksburg,--"
7881,FINALE,"Perhaps the day you reck,"
7882,FINALE,"Our boys, the Twenty-second Maine,"
7883,FINALE,Kept Early's men in check.
7884,FINALE,Just where Wade Hampton boomed away
7885,FINALE,The fight went neck and neck.
7886,FINALE,
7887,FINALE,"All day the weaker wing we held,"
7888,FINALE,And held it with a will.
7889,FINALE,Five several stubborn times we charged
7890,FINALE,"The battery on the hill,"
7891,FINALE,"And five times beaten back, re-formed,"
7892,FINALE,And kept our column still.
7893,FINALE,
7894,FINALE,At last from out the center fight
7895,FINALE,"Spurred up a general's aide,"
7896,FINALE,"""That battery must silenced be!"""
7897,FINALE,"He cried, as past he sped."
7898,FINALE,"Our colonel simply touched his cap,"
7899,FINALE,"And then, with measured tread,"
7900,FINALE,
7901,FINALE,"To lead the crouching line once more,"
7902,FINALE,The grand old fellow came.
7903,FINALE,No wounded man but raised his head
7904,FINALE,"And strove to gasp his name,"
7905,FINALE,"And those who could not speak nor stir,"
7906,FINALE,"""God blessed him"" just the same."
7907,FINALE,
7908,FINALE,"For he was all the world to us,"
7909,FINALE,That hero gray and grim;
7910,FINALE,Right well we knew that fearful slope
7911,FINALE,"We'd climb with none but him,"
7912,FINALE,Though while his white head led the way
7913,FINALE,We'd charge hell's portals in.
7914,FINALE,
7915,FINALE,This time we were not half way up
7916,FINALE,"When, midst the storm of shell,"
7917,FINALE,"Our leader, with his sword upraised,"
7918,FINALE,"Beneath our bayonets fell,"
7919,FINALE,"And as we bore him back, the foe"
7920,FINALE,Set up a joyous yell.
7921,FINALE,
7922,FINALE,"Our hearts went with him. Back we swept,"
7923,FINALE,"And when the bugle said,"
7924,FINALE,"""Up, charge again!"" no man was there"
7925,FINALE,But hung his dogged head.
7926,FINALE,"""We've no one left to lead us now,"""
7927,FINALE,The sullen soldiers said.
7928,FINALE,
7929,FINALE,Just then before the laggard line
7930,FINALE,The colonel's horse we spied--
7931,FINALE,"Bay Billy, with his trappings on,"
7932,FINALE,"His nostrils swelling wide,"
7933,FINALE,As though still on his gallant back
7934,FINALE,The master sat astride.
7935,FINALE,
7936,FINALE,Right royally he took the place
7937,FINALE,"That was of old his wont,"
7938,FINALE,"And with a neigh that seemed to say,"
7939,FINALE,"Above the battle's brunt,"
7940,FINALE,"""How can the Twenty-second charge"
7941,FINALE,"If I am not in front?"""
7942,FINALE,
7943,FINALE,"Like statues rooted there we stood,"
7944,FINALE,And gazed a little space;
7945,FINALE,Above that floating mane we missed
7946,FINALE,"The dear familiar face,"
7947,FINALE,"But we saw Bay Billy's eye of fire,"
7948,FINALE,And it gave us heart of grace.
7949,FINALE,
7950,FINALE,No bugle-call could rouse us all
7951,FINALE,As that brave sight had done.
7952,FINALE,Down all the battered line we felt
7953,FINALE,A lightning impulse run.
7954,FINALE,"Up, up the hill we followed Bill,--"
7955,FINALE,And we captured every gun!
7956,FINALE,
7957,FINALE,And when upon the conquered height
7958,FINALE,"Died out the battle's hum,"
7959,FINALE,Vainly 'mid living and the dead
7960,FINALE,We sought our leader dumb.
7961,FINALE,It seemed as if a spectre steed
7962,FINALE,To win that day had come.
7963,FINALE,
7964,FINALE,And then the dusk and dew of night
7965,FINALE,"Fell softly o'er the plain,"
7966,FINALE,As though o'er man's dread work of death
7967,FINALE,"The angels wept again,"
7968,FINALE,And drew night's curtain gently round
7969,FINALE,A thousand beds of pain.
7970,FINALE,
7971,FINALE,All night the surgeons' torches went
7972,FINALE,"The ghastly rows between,--"
7973,FINALE,All night with solemn step I paced
7974,FINALE,The torn and bloody green.
7975,FINALE,But who that fought in the big war
7976,FINALE,Such dread sights have not seen?
7977,FINALE,
7978,FINALE,At last the morning broke. The lark
7979,FINALE,"Sang in the merry skies,"
7980,FINALE,As if to e'en the sleepers there
7981,FINALE,"It said ""Awake, arise!"""
7982,FINALE,Though naught but that last trump of all
7983,FINALE,Could ope their heavy eyes.
7984,FINALE,
7985,FINALE,"And then once more, with banners gay,"
7986,FINALE,Stretched out the long brigade.
7987,FINALE,Trimly upon the furrowed field
7988,FINALE,"The troops stood on parade,"
7989,FINALE,And bravely 'mid the ranks were closed
7990,FINALE,The gaps the fight had made.
7991,FINALE,
7992,FINALE,Not half the Twenty-second's men
7993,FINALE,Were in their place that morn;
7994,FINALE,"And Corporal Dick, who yester-noon"
7995,FINALE,"Stood six brave fellows on,"
7996,FINALE,"Now touched my elbow in the ranks,"
7997,FINALE,For all between were gone.
7998,FINALE,
7999,FINALE,Ah! who forgets that weary hour
8000,FINALE,"When, as with misty eyes,"
8001,FINALE,To call the old familiar roll
8002,FINALE,"The solemn sergeant tries,--"
8003,FINALE,One feels that thumping of the heart
8004,FINALE,As no prompt voice replies.
8005,FINALE,
8006,FINALE,And as in faltering tone and slow
8007,FINALE,"The last few names were said,"
8008,FINALE,Across the field some missing horse
8009,FINALE,Toiled up with weary tread.
8010,FINALE,"It caught the sergeant's eye, and quick"
8011,FINALE,Bay Billy's name he read.
8012,FINALE,
8013,FINALE,"Yes! there the old bay hero stood,"
8014,FINALE,"All safe from battle's harms,"
8015,FINALE,"And ere an order could be heard,"
8016,FINALE,"Or the bugle's quick alarms,"
8017,FINALE,"Down all the front, from end to end,"
8018,FINALE,The troops presented arms!
8019,FINALE,
8020,FINALE,Not all the shoulder-straps on earth
8021,FINALE,Could still our mighty cheer;
8022,FINALE,"And ever from that famous day,"
8023,FINALE,"When rang the roll-call clear,"
8024,FINALE,"Bay Billy's name was read, and then"
8025,FINALE,"The whole line answered, ""Here!"""

8032,FINALE,The Legend of the Organ-Builder
8033,FINALE,
8034,FINALE,
8035,FINALE,Day by day the Organ-builder in his lonely chamber wrought;
8036,FINALE,Day by day the soft air trembled to the music of his thought;
8037,FINALE,Till at last the work was ended; and no organ voice so grand
8038,FINALE,Ever yet had soared responsive to the master's magic hand.
8039,FINALE,
8040,FINALE,"Ay, so rarely was it builded that whenever groom and bride,"
8041,FINALE,"Who, in God's sight were well-pleasing, in the church stood side by side,"
8042,FINALE,"Without touch or breath the organ of itself began to play,"
8043,FINALE,And the very airs of heaven through the soft gloom seemed to stray.
8044,FINALE,
8045,FINALE,"He was young, the Organ-builder, and o'er all the land his fame"
8046,FINALE,"Ran with fleet and eager footsteps, like a swiftly rushing flame."
8047,FINALE,"All the maidens heard the story; all the maidens blushed and smiled,"
8048,FINALE,By his youth and wondrous beauty and his great renown beguiled.
8049,FINALE,
8050,FINALE,"So he sought and won the fairest, and the wedding-day was set"
8051,FINALE,Happy day--the brightest jewel in the glad year's coronet!
8052,FINALE,"But when they the portal entered, he forgot his lovely bride--"
8053,FINALE,"Forgot his love, forgot his God, and his heart swelled high with pride."
8054,FINALE,
8055,FINALE,"""Ah!"" thought he, ""how great a master am I! When the organ plays,"
8056,FINALE,"How the vast cathedral-arches will re-echo with my praise!"""
8057,FINALE,"Up the aisle the gay procession moved. The altar shone afar,"
8058,FINALE,With every candle gleaming through soft shadows like a star.
8059,FINALE,
8060,FINALE,"But he listened, listened, listened, with no thought of love or prayer,"
8061,FINALE,For the swelling notes of triumph from his organ standing there.
8062,FINALE,"All was silent. Nothing heard he save the priest's low monotone,"
8063,FINALE,And the bride's robe trailing softly o'er the floor of fretted stone.
8064,FINALE,
8065,FINALE,"Then his lips grew white with anger. Surely God was pleased with him,"
8066,FINALE,Who had built the wondrous organ for His temple vast and dim!
8067,FINALE,Whose the fault then? Hers--the maiden standing meekly at his side!
8068,FINALE,"Flamed his jealous rage, maintaining she was false to him--his bride."
8069,FINALE,
8070,FINALE,"Vain were all her protestations, vain her innocence and truth;"
8071,FINALE,On that very night he left her to her anguish and her ruth.
8072,FINALE,Far he wandered to a country wherein no man knew his name:
8073,FINALE,"For ten weary years he dwelt there, nursing still his wrath and shame."
8074,FINALE,
8075,FINALE,"Then his haughty heart grew softer, and he thought by night and day"
8076,FINALE,"Of the bride he had deserted, till he hardly dared to pray;"
8077,FINALE,"Thought of her, a spotless maiden, fair and beautiful and good;"
8078,FINALE,"Thought of his relentless anger, that had cursed her womanhood;"
8079,FINALE,
8080,FINALE,"Till his yearning grief and penitence at last were all complete,"
8081,FINALE,"And he longed, with bitter longing, just to fall down at her feet."
8082,FINALE,"Ah! how throbbed his heart when, after many a weary day and night,"
8083,FINALE,"Rose his native towers before him, with the sunset glow alight!"
8084,FINALE,
8085,FINALE,Through the gates into the city on he pressed with eager tread;
8086,FINALE,There he met a long procession--mourners following the dead.
8087,FINALE,"""Now why weep ye so, good people? And whom bury ye today?"
8088,FINALE,Why do yonder sorrowing maidens scatter flowers along the way?
8089,FINALE,
8090,FINALE,"""Has some saint gone up to heaven?"" ""Yes,"" they answered, weeping sore;"
8091,FINALE,"""For the Organ-builder's saintly wife our eyes shall see no more;"
8092,FINALE,"And because her days were given to the service of God's poor,"
8093,FINALE,"From His church we mean to bury her. See! yonder is the door."""
8094,FINALE,
8095,FINALE,"No one knew him; no one wondered when he cried out, white with pain;"
8096,FINALE,"No one questioned when, with pallid lips, he poured his tears like rain."
8097,FINALE,"""'Tis someone she has comforted, who mourns with us,"" they said,"
8098,FINALE,"As he made his way unchallenged, and bore the coffin's head;"
8099,FINALE,
8100,FINALE,"Bore it through the open portal, bore it up the echoing aisle,"
8101,FINALE,"Let it down before the altar, where the lights burned clear the while."
8102,FINALE,"When, oh, hark; the wondrous organ of itself began to play"
8103,FINALE,"Strains of rare, unearthly sweetness never heard until that day!"
8104,FINALE,
8105,FINALE,All the vaulted arches rang with music sweet and clear;
8106,FINALE,"All the air was filled with glory, as of angels hovering near;"
8107,FINALE,"And ere yet the strain was ended, he who bore the coffin's head,"
8108,FINALE,"With the smile of one forgiven, gently sank beside it--dead."
8109,FINALE,
8110,FINALE,"They who raised the body knew him, and they laid him by his bride;"
8111,FINALE,"Down the aisle and o'er the threshold they were carried, side by side;"
8112,FINALE,"While the organ played a dirge that no man ever heard before,"
8113,FINALE,And then softly sank to silence--silence kept forevermore.

8219,FINALE,"This badinage the poor wretch took with stoical, good grace;"
8220,FINALE,"In fact, he smiled as though he thought he'd struck the proper place."
8221,FINALE,"""Come, boys, I know there's kindly hearts among so good a crowd--"
8222,FINALE,To be in such good company would make a deacon proud.
8223,FINALE,
8224,FINALE,"""Give me a drink--that's what I want--I'm out of funds, you know;"
8225,FINALE,"When I had cash to treat the gang, this hand was never slow."
8226,FINALE,What? You laugh as though you thought this pocket never held a sou;
8227,FINALE,"I once was fixed as well, my boys, as any one of you."
8228,FINALE,
8229,FINALE,"""There, thanks; that's braced me nicely; God bless you one and all;"
8230,FINALE,"Next time I pass this good saloon, I'll make another call."
8231,FINALE,"_Give you a song?_ No, I can't do that, my singing days are past;"

8233,FINALE,
8234,FINALE,"""Say! give me another whisky, and I'll tell you what I'll do--"
8235,FINALE,"I'll tell you a funny story, and a fact, I promise, too."
8236,FINALE,"That I was ever a decent man, not one of you would think;"
8237,FINALE,"But I was, some four or five years back. Say, give me another drink."
8238,FINALE,
8239,FINALE,"""Fill her up, Joe, I want to put some life into my frame--"
8240,FINALE,"Such little drinks, to a bum like me, are miserably tame;"
8241,FINALE,"Five fingers--there, that's the scheme--and corking whisky, too."
8242,FINALE,"Well, here's luck, boys; and landlord, my best regards to you."
8243,FINALE,
8244,FINALE,"""You've treated me pretty kindly, and I'd like to tell you how"
8245,FINALE,I came to be the dirty sot you see before you now.
8246,FINALE,"As I told you, once I was a man, with muscle, frame and health,"
8247,FINALE,"And but for a blunder, ought to have made considerable wealth."
8248,FINALE,
8249,FINALE,"""I was a painter--not one that daubed on bricks and wood,"
8250,FINALE,"But an artist, and, for my age, was rated pretty good."
8251,FINALE,"I worked hard at my canvas, and was bidding fair to rise,"
8252,FINALE,For gradually I saw the star of fame before my eyes.
8253,FINALE,
8254,FINALE,"""I made a picture, perhaps you've seen, 'tis called the 'Chase of Fame.'"
8255,FINALE,"It brought me fifteen hundred pounds, and added to my name."
8256,FINALE,And then I met a woman--now comes the funny part--
8257,FINALE,With eyes that petrified my brain and sunk into my heart.
8258,FINALE,
8259,FINALE,"""Why don't you laugh? 'Tis funny that the vagabond you see"
8260,FINALE,"Could ever love a woman, and expect her love for me;"
8261,FINALE,"But 'twas so, and for a month or two her smiles were freely given,"
8262,FINALE,And when her loving lips touched mine it carried me to heaven.
8263,FINALE,
8264,FINALE,"""Did you ever see a woman for whom your soul you'd give,"
8265,FINALE,"With a form like the Milo Venus, too beautiful to live;"
8266,FINALE,"With eyes that would beat the Koh-i-noor, and a wealth of chestnut hair?"
8267,FINALE,"If so, 'twas she, for there never was another half so fair."
8268,FINALE,
8269,FINALE,"""I was working on a portrait, one afternoon in May,"
8270,FINALE,"Of a fair-haired boy, a friend of mine, who lived across the way;"
8271,FINALE,"And Madeline admired it, and, much to my surprise,"
8272,FINALE,Said that she'd like to know the man that had such dreamy eyes.
8273,FINALE,
8274,FINALE,"""It didn't take long to know him, and before the month had flown,"
8275,FINALE,"My friend had stolen my darling, and I was left alone;"
8276,FINALE,"And ere a year of misery had passed above my head,"
8277,FINALE,"The jewel I had treasured so had tarnished, and was dead."
8278,FINALE,
8279,FINALE,"""That's why I took to drink, boys. Why, I never saw you smile,--"
8280,FINALE,"I thought you'd be amused, and laughing all the while."
8281,FINALE,"Why, what's the mattter, friend? There's a teardrop in your eye,"
8282,FINALE,"Come, laugh, like me; 'tis only babes and women that should cry."
8283,FINALE,
8284,FINALE,"""Say, boys, if you give me just another whisky, I'll be glad,"
8285,FINALE,And I'll draw right here a picture of the face that drove me mad.
8286,FINALE,Give me that piece of chalk with which you mark the baseball score--
8287,FINALE,"You shall see the lovely Madeline upon the bar-room floor."""
8288,FINALE,
8289,FINALE,"Another drink, and, with chalk in hand, the vagabond began"
8290,FINALE,To sketch a face that well might buy the soul of any man.
8291,FINALE,"Then as he placed another lock upon the shapely head,"
8292,FINALE,"With a fearful shriek, he leaped, and fell across the picture dead."

8299,FINALE,The Calf Path
8300,FINALE,
8301,FINALE,
8302,FINALE,"One day through the primeval wood,"
8303,FINALE,"A calf walked home, as good calves should;"
8304,FINALE,"But made a trail all bent askew,"
8305,FINALE,"A crooked trail, as all calves do."
8306,FINALE,"Since then three hundred years have fled,"
8307,FINALE,"And, I infer, the calf is dead."
8308,FINALE,
8309,FINALE,"But still he left behind his trail,"
8310,FINALE,And thereby hangs a moral tale.
8311,FINALE,The trail was taken up next day
8312,FINALE,"By a lone dog that passed that way,"
8313,FINALE,And then the wise bell-wether sheep
8314,FINALE,"Pursued the trail o'er vale and steep,"
8315,FINALE,"And drew the flock behind him, too,"
8316,FINALE,As good bell-wethers always do.
8317,FINALE,"And from that day, o'er hill and glade,"
8318,FINALE,Through those old woods a path was made.
8319,FINALE,
8320,FINALE,"And many men wound in and out,"
8321,FINALE,"And turned and dodged and bent about,"
8322,FINALE,And uttered words of righteous wrath
8323,FINALE,Because 'twas such a crooked path:
8324,FINALE,But still they followed--do not laugh--
8325,FINALE,"The first migrations of that calf,"
8326,FINALE,And through this winding woodway stalked
8327,FINALE,Because he wabbled when he walked.
8328,FINALE,
8329,FINALE,"This forest path became a lane,"
8330,FINALE,That bent and turned and turned again;
8331,FINALE,This crooked path became a road.
8332,FINALE,"Where many a poor horse, with his load,"
8333,FINALE,"Toiled on beneath the burning sun,"
8334,FINALE,And traveled some three miles in one.
8335,FINALE,And thus a century and a half
8336,FINALE,They trod the footsteps of that calf.
8337,FINALE,
8338,FINALE,"The years passed on in swiftness fleet,"
8339,FINALE,The road became a village street;
8340,FINALE,"And this, before men were aware,"
8341,FINALE,A city's crowded thoroughfare.
8342,FINALE,And soon the central street was this
8343,FINALE,Of a renowned metropolis.
8344,FINALE,And men two centuries and a half
8345,FINALE,Trod in the footsteps of that calf!
8346,FINALE,
8347,FINALE,Each day a hundred thousand rout
8348,FINALE,Followed the zigzag calf about;
8349,FINALE,And o'er his crooked journey went
8350,FINALE,The traffic of a continent.
8351,FINALE,A hundred thousand men were led
8352,FINALE,By a calf near three centuries dead.
8353,FINALE,They followed still his crooked way
8354,FINALE,And lost one hundred years a day;
8355,FINALE,For thus such reverence is lent
8356,FINALE,To well-established precedent.
8357,FINALE,
8358,FINALE,A moral lesson this might teach
8359,FINALE,Were I ordained and called to preach;
8360,FINALE,"For men are prone to go it blind,"
8361,FINALE,"Along the calf-paths of the mind,"
8362,FINALE,And work away from sun to sun
8363,FINALE,To do what other men have done.
8364,FINALE,"They follow in the beaten track,"
8365,FINALE,"And out and in, and forth and back,"
8366,FINALE,"And still their devious course pursue,"
8367,FINALE,To keep the path that others do.
8368,FINALE,"But how the wise wood-gods must laugh,"
8369,FINALE,Who saw the first primeval calf;
8370,FINALE,"Ah, many things this tale might teach--"
8371,FINALE,But I am not ordained to preach.

8379,FINALE,
8380,FINALE,
8381,FINALE,Paul Revere was a rider bold--
8382,FINALE,Well has his valorous deed been told;
8383,FINALE,Sheridan's ride was a glorious one--
8384,FINALE,Often it has been dwelt upon;
8385,FINALE,But why should men do all the deeds
8386,FINALE,On which the love of a patriot feeds?
8387,FINALE,"Hearken to me, while I reveal"
8388,FINALE,The dashing ride of Jennie M'Neal.
8389,FINALE,
8390,FINALE,On a spot as pretty as might be found
8391,FINALE,"In the dangerous length of the Neutral Ground,"
8392,FINALE,"In a cottage, cozy, and all their own,"
8393,FINALE,She and her mother lived alone.
8394,FINALE,"Safe were the two, with their frugal store,"
8395,FINALE,From all of the many who passed their door;
8396,FINALE,"For Jennie's mother was strange to fears,"
8397,FINALE,And Jennie was large for fifteen years;
8398,FINALE,"With vim her eyes were glistening,"
8399,FINALE,Her hair was the hue of a blackbird's wing;
8400,FINALE,And while the friends who knew her well
8401,FINALE,"The sweetness of her heart could tell,"
8402,FINALE,A gun that hung on the kitchen wall
8403,FINALE,Looked solemnly quick to heed her call;
8404,FINALE,And they who were evil-minded knew
8405,FINALE,Her nerve was strong and her aim was true.
8406,FINALE,So all kind words and acts did deal
8407,FINALE,"To generous, black-eyed Jennie M'Neal."
8408,FINALE,
8409,FINALE,"One night, when the sun had crept to bed,"
8410,FINALE,"And rain-clouds lingered overhead,"
8411,FINALE,And sent their surly drops for proof
8412,FINALE,"To drum a tune on the cottage roof,"
8413,FINALE,Close after a knock at the outer door
8414,FINALE,There entered a dozen dragoons or more.
8415,FINALE,"Their red coats, stained by the muddy road,"
8416,FINALE,That they were British soldiers showed;
8417,FINALE,"The captain his hostess bent to greet,"
8418,FINALE,"Saying, ""Madam, please give us a bit to eat;"
8419,FINALE,"We will pay you well, and, if may be,"
8420,FINALE,This bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea;
8421,FINALE,"Then we must dash ten miles ahead,"
8422,FINALE,To catch a rebel colonel abed.
8423,FINALE,"He is visiting home, as doth appear;"
8424,FINALE,"We will make his pleasure cost him dear."""
8425,FINALE,"And they fell on the hasty supper with zeal,"
8426,FINALE,Close-watched the while by Jennie M'Neal.
8427,FINALE,
8428,FINALE,For the gray-haired colonel they hovered near
8429,FINALE,"Had been her true friend, kind and dear;"
8430,FINALE,"And oft, in her younger days, had he"
8431,FINALE,"Right proudly perched her upon his knee,"
8432,FINALE,And told her stories many a one
8433,FINALE,Concerning the French war lately done.
8434,FINALE,"And oft together the two friends were,"
8435,FINALE,And many the arts he had taught to her;
8436,FINALE,"She had hunted by his fatherly side,"
8437,FINALE,He had shown her how to fence and ride;
8438,FINALE,"And once had said, ""The time may be,"
8439,FINALE,"Your skill and courage may stand by me."""
8440,FINALE,"So sorrow for him she could but feel,"
8441,FINALE,"Brave, grateful-hearted Jennie M'Neal."
8442,FINALE,
8443,FINALE,"With never a thought or a moment more,"
8444,FINALE,"Bare-headed she slipped from the cottage door,"
8445,FINALE,"Ran out where the horses were left to feed,"
8446,FINALE,"Unhitched and mounted the captain's steed,"
8447,FINALE,And down the hilly and rock-strewn way
8448,FINALE,She urged the fiery horse of gray.
8449,FINALE,Around her slender and cloakless form
8450,FINALE,Pattered and moaned the ceaseless storm;
8451,FINALE,Secure and tight a gloveless hand
8452,FINALE,Grasped the reins with stern command;
8453,FINALE,"And full and black her long hair streamed,"
8454,FINALE,Whenever the ragged lightning gleamed.
8455,FINALE,"And on she rushed for the colonel's weal,"
8456,FINALE,"Brave, lioness-hearted Jennie M'Neal."
8457,FINALE,
8458,FINALE,"Hark! from the hills, a moment mute,"
8459,FINALE,Came a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit;
8460,FINALE,"And a cry from the foremost trooper said,"
8461,FINALE,"""Halt! or your blood be on your head"";"
8462,FINALE,"She heeded it not, and not in vain"
8463,FINALE,She lashed the horse with the bridle-rein.
8464,FINALE,
8465,FINALE,So into the night the gray horse strode;
8466,FINALE,His shoes hewed fire from the rocky road;
8467,FINALE,And the high-born courage that never dies
8468,FINALE,Flashed from his rider's coal-black eyes.
8469,FINALE,The pebbles flew from the fearful race:
8470,FINALE,The raindrops grasped at her glowing face.
8471,FINALE,"""On, on, brave beast!"" with loud appeal,"
8472,FINALE,"Cried eager, resolute Jennie M'Neal."
8473,FINALE,
8474,FINALE,"""Halt!"" once more came the voice of dread;"
8475,FINALE,"""Halt! or your blood be on your head!"""
8476,FINALE,"Then, no one answering to the calls,"
8477,FINALE,Sped after her a volley of balls.
8478,FINALE,"They passed her in her rapid flight,"
8479,FINALE,"They screamed to her left, they screamed to her right;"
8480,FINALE,"But, rushing still o'er the slippery track,"
8481,FINALE,"She sent no token of answer back,"
8482,FINALE,"Except a silvery laughter-peal,"
8483,FINALE,"Brave, merry-hearted Jennie M'Neal."
8484,FINALE,
8485,FINALE,"So on she rushed, at her own good will,"
8486,FINALE,"Through wood and valley, o'er plain and hill;"
8487,FINALE,"The gray horse did his duty well,"
8488,FINALE,"Till all at once he stumbled and fell,"
8489,FINALE,"Himself escaping the nets of harm,"
8490,FINALE,But flinging the girl with a broken arm.
8491,FINALE,"Still undismayed by the numbing pain,"
8492,FINALE,She clung to the horse's bridle-rein
8493,FINALE,"And gently bidding him to stand,"
8494,FINALE,Petted him with her able hand;
8495,FINALE,"Then sprung again to the saddle bow,"
8496,FINALE,"And shouted, ""One more trial now!"""
8497,FINALE,"As if ashamed of the heedless fall,"
8498,FINALE,"He gathered his strength once more for all,"
8499,FINALE,"And, galloping down a hillside steep,"
8500,FINALE,Gained on the troopers at every leap;
8501,FINALE,"No more the high-bred steed did reel,"
8502,FINALE,But ran his best for Jennie M'Neal.
8503,FINALE,
8504,FINALE,"They were a furlong behind, or more,"
8505,FINALE,"When the girl burst through the colonel's door,"
8506,FINALE,"Her poor arm helpless hanging with pain,"
8507,FINALE,"And she all drabbled and drenched with rain,"
8508,FINALE,"But her cheeks as red as fire-brands are,"
8509,FINALE,"And her eyes as bright as a blazing star,"
8510,FINALE,"And shouted, ""Quick! be quick, I say!"
8511,FINALE,"They come! they come! Away! away!"""
8512,FINALE,"Then, sunk on the rude white floor of deal,"
8513,FINALE,"Poor, brave, exhausted Jennie M'Neal."
8514,FINALE,
8515,FINALE,"The startled colonel sprung, and pressed"
8516,FINALE,"The wife and children to his breast,"
8517,FINALE,"And turned away from his fireside bright,"
8518,FINALE,And glided into the stormy night;
8519,FINALE,Then soon and safely made his way
8520,FINALE,To where the patriot army lay.
8521,FINALE,"But first he bent in the dim firelight,"
8522,FINALE,"And kissed the forehead broad and white,"
8523,FINALE,And blessed the girl who had ridden so well
8524,FINALE,To keep him out of a prison-cell.
8525,FINALE,"The girl roused up at the martial din,"
8526,FINALE,"Just as the troopers came rushing in,"
8527,FINALE,"And laughed, e'en in the midst of a moan,"
8528,FINALE,"Saying, ""Good sirs, your bird has flown."
8529,FINALE,'Tis I who have scared him from his nest;
8530,FINALE,"So deal with me now as you think best."""
8531,FINALE,"But the grand young captain bowed, and said,"
8532,FINALE,"""Never you hold a moment's dread."
8533,FINALE,Of womankind I must crown you queen;
8534,FINALE,So brave a girl I have never seen.
8535,FINALE,Wear this gold ring as your valor's due;
8536,FINALE,"And when peace comes I will come for you."""
8537,FINALE,"But Jennie's face an arch smile wore,"
8538,FINALE,"As she said, ""There's a lad in Putnam's corps,"
8539,FINALE,"Who told me the same, long time ago;"
8540,FINALE,"You two would never agree, I know."
8541,FINALE,"I promised my love to be as true as steel,"""
8542,FINALE,"Said good, sure-hearted Jennie M'Neal."

8681,FINALE,
8682,FINALE,God made man in His own image; in the image of God made he
8683,FINALE,him.--GENESIS.
8684,FINALE,
8685,FINALE,
8686,FINALE,Bowed by the weight of centuries he leans
8687,FINALE,"Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,"
8688,FINALE,"The emptiness of ages in his face,"
8689,FINALE,And on his back the burden of the world.
8690,FINALE,"Who made him dead to rapture and despair,"
8691,FINALE,"A thing that grieves not and that never hopes,"
8692,FINALE,"Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?"
8693,FINALE,Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?
8694,FINALE,Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow?
8695,FINALE,Whose breath blew out the light within this brain?
8696,FINALE,"Is this the Thing, the Lord God made and gave"
8697,FINALE,To have dominion over sea and land;
8698,FINALE,To trace the stars and search the heavens for power;
8699,FINALE,To feel the passion of Eternity?
8700,FINALE,Is this the dream He dreamed who shaped the suns
8701,FINALE,And pillared the blue firmament with light?
8702,FINALE,Down all the stretch of Hell to its last gulf

8706,FINALE,More fraught with menace to the universe.

8712,FINALE,"The rift of dawn, the reddening of the rose?"
8713,FINALE,Through this dread shape the suffering ages look;

8715,FINALE,"Through this dread shape humanity betrayed,"
8716,FINALE,"Plundered, profaned and disinherited,"
8717,FINALE,"Cries protest to the judges of the world,"
8718,FINALE,A protest that is also prophecy.

8720,FINALE,"O masters, lords and rulers in all lands,"
8721,FINALE,"Is this the handiwork you give to God,"

8745,FINALE,
8746,FINALE,"Did you say you wished to see me, sir? Step in; 'tis a cheerless place,"
8747,FINALE,But you're heartily welcome all the same; to be poor is no disgrace.
8748,FINALE,"Have I been here long? Oh, yes, sir! 'tis thirty winters gone"
8749,FINALE,Since poor Jim took to crooked ways and left me all alone!
8750,FINALE,"Jim was my son, and a likelier lad you'd never wish to see,"
8751,FINALE,Till evil counsels won his heart and led him away from me.
8752,FINALE,
8753,FINALE,"'Tis the old, sad, pitiful story, sir, of the devil's winding stair,"
8754,FINALE,And men go down--and down--and down--to blackness and despair;
8755,FINALE,"Tossing about like wrecks at sea, with helm and anchor lost,"
8756,FINALE,"On and on, through the surging waves, nor caring to count the cost;"
8757,FINALE,"I doubt sometimes if the Savior sees, He seems so far away,"
8758,FINALE,"How the souls He loved and died for, are drifting--drifting astray!"
8759,FINALE,
8760,FINALE,"Indeed,'tis little wonder, sir, if woman shrinks and cries"
8761,FINALE,When the life-blood on Rum's altar spilled is calling to the skies;
8762,FINALE,"Small wonder if her own heart feels each sacrificial blow,"
8763,FINALE,For isn't each life a part of hers? each pain her hurt and woe?
8764,FINALE,"Read all the records of crime and shame--'tis bitterly, sadly true;"
8765,FINALE,"Where manliness and honor die, there some woman's heart dies, too."
8766,FINALE,
8767,FINALE,"I often think, when I hear folks talk so prettily and so fine"
8768,FINALE,"Of ""alcohol as needful food""; of the ""moderate use of wine"";"
8769,FINALE,"How ""the world couldn't do without it, there was clearly no other way"
8770,FINALE,"But for a man to drink, or let it alone, as his own strong will might say"";"
8771,FINALE,"That ""to use it, but not abuse it, was the proper thing to do,"""
8772,FINALE,"How I wish they'd let old Poorhouse Nan preach her little sermon, too!"
8773,FINALE,
8774,FINALE,I would give them scenes in a woman's life that would make their
8775,FINALE,"pulses stir,"
8776,FINALE,"For I was a drunkard's child and wife--aye, a drunkard's mother, sir!"
8777,FINALE,"I would tell of childish terrors, of childish tears and pain."
8778,FINALE,Of cruel blows from a father's hand when rum had crazed his brain;
8779,FINALE,"He always said he could drink his fill, or let it alone as well;"
8780,FINALE,"Perhaps he might, he was killed one night in a brawl--in a grog-shop hell!"
8781,FINALE,
8782,FINALE,"I would tell of years of loveless toil the drunkard's child had passed,"
8783,FINALE,"With just one gleam of sunshine, too beautiful to last."
8784,FINALE,"When I married Tom I thought for sure I had nothing more to fear,"
8785,FINALE,That life would come all right at last; the world seemed full of cheer.
8786,FINALE,"But he took to moderate drinking--he allowed 'twas a harmless thing,"
8787,FINALE,"So the arrow sped, and my bird of Hope came down with a broken wing."
8788,FINALE,
8789,FINALE,"Tom was only a moderate drinker; ah, sir, do you bear in mind"
8790,FINALE,How the plodding tortoise in the race left the leaping hare behind?
8791,FINALE,"'Twas because he held right on and on, steady and true, if slow,"
8792,FINALE,"And that's the way, I'm thinking, that the moderate drinkers go!"
8793,FINALE,"Step over step--day after day--with sleepless, tireless pace,"
8794,FINALE,While the toper sometimes looks behind and tarries in the race!
8795,FINALE,
8796,FINALE,"Ah, heavily in the well-worn path poor Tom walked day by day,"
8797,FINALE,For my heart-strings clung about his feet and tangled up the way;
8798,FINALE,"The days were dark, and friends were gone, and life dragged on full slow,"
8799,FINALE,"And children came, like reapers, and to a harvest of want and woe!"
8800,FINALE,"Two of them died, and I was glad when they lay before me dead;"
8801,FINALE,I had grown so weary of their cries--their pitiful cries for bread.
8802,FINALE,
8803,FINALE,There came a time when my heart was stone; I could neither hope nor pray;
8804,FINALE,"Poor Tom lay out in the Potter's Field, and my boy had gone astray;"
8805,FINALE,"My boy who'd been my idol, while, like hound athirst for blood,"
8806,FINALE,"Between my breaking heart and him the liquor seller stood,"
8807,FINALE,"And lured him on with pleasant words, his pleasures and his wine;"
8808,FINALE,"Ah, God have pity on other hearts as bruised and hurt as mine."
8809,FINALE,
8810,FINALE,"There were whispers of evil-doing, of dishonor, and of shame,"
8811,FINALE,"That I cannot bear to think of now, and would not dare to name!"
8812,FINALE,"There was hiding away from the light of day, there was creeping about at"
8813,FINALE,"night,"
8814,FINALE,A hurried word of parting--then a criminal's stealthy flight!
8815,FINALE,His lips were white with remorse and fright when he gave me a good-by kiss;
8816,FINALE,And I've never seen my poor lost boy from that black day to this.
8817,FINALE,
8818,FINALE,"Ah, none but a mother can tell you, sir, how a mother's heart will ache,"
8819,FINALE,"With the sorrow that comes of a sinning child, with grief for a lost one's"
8820,FINALE,"sake,"
8821,FINALE,"When she knows the feet she trained to walk have gone so far astray,"
8822,FINALE,And the lips grown bold with curses that she taught to sing and pray;
8823,FINALE,"A child may fear--a wife may weep, but of all sad things, none other"
8824,FINALE,Seems half so sorrowful to me as being a drunkard's mother.
8825,FINALE,
8826,FINALE,"They tell me that down in the vilest dens of the city's crime and murk,"
8827,FINALE,"There are men with the hearts of angels, doing the angels' work;"
8828,FINALE,"That they win back the lost and the straying, that they help the weak to"
8829,FINALE,"stand,"
8830,FINALE,By the wonderful power of loving words--and the help of God's right hand!
8831,FINALE,"And often and often, the dear Lord knows, I've knelt and prayed to Him,"
8832,FINALE,"That somewhere, somehow, 'twould happen that they'd find and save my Jim!"
8833,FINALE,
8834,FINALE,"You'll say 'tis a poor old woman's whim; but when I prayed last night,"
8835,FINALE,Right over yon eastern window there shone a wonderful light!
8836,FINALE,(Leastways it looked that way to me) and out of the light there fell
8837,FINALE,The softest voice I had ever heard: it rung like a silver bell;
8838,FINALE,"And these were the words, ""The prodigal turns, so tired by want and sin,"
8839,FINALE,"He seeks his father's open door--he weeps--and enters in."""
8840,FINALE,
8841,FINALE,"Why, sir, you're crying as hard as I; what--is it really done?"
8842,FINALE,Have the loving voice and the Helping Hand brought back my wandering son?
8843,FINALE,"Did you kiss me and call me ""Mother""--and hold me to your breast,"
8844,FINALE,Or is it one of the taunting dreams that come to mock my rest?
8845,FINALE,"No--no! thank God, 'tis a dream come true! I can die, for He's saved"
8846,FINALE,my boy!
8847,FINALE,And the poor old heart that had lived on grief was broken at last by joy!

8894,FINALE,"So the multitude comes--even those we behold,"

8936,FINALE,That blazed before Fort Sumter had wakened the North as one;
8937,FINALE,Long ere the wondrous pillar of battle-cloud and fire
8938,FINALE,Had marked where the unchained millions marched on to their heart's desire.
8939,FINALE,"On roofs and glittering turrets, that night, as the sun went down,"
8940,FINALE,"The mellow glow of the twilight shone like a jeweled crown,"
8941,FINALE,"And, bathed in the living glory, as the people lifted their eyes,"
8942,FINALE,"They saw the pride of the city, the spire of St. Michael's rise"
8943,FINALE,"High over the lesser steeples, tipped with a golden ball"
8944,FINALE,That hung like a radiant planet caught in its earthward fall;
8945,FINALE,"First glimpse of home to the sailor who made the harbor round,"
8946,FINALE,And last slow-fading vision dear to the outward bound.
8947,FINALE,The gently gathering shadows shut out the waning light;
8948,FINALE,The children prayed at their bedsides as they were wont each night;
8949,FINALE,"The noise of buyer and seller from the busy mart was gone,"
8950,FINALE,And in dreams of a peaceful morrow the city slumbered on.
8951,FINALE,
8952,FINALE,"But another light than sunrise aroused the sleeping street,"
8953,FINALE,"For a cry was heard at midnight, and the rush of trampling feet;"
8954,FINALE,"Men stared in each other's faces, thro' mingled fire and smoke,"
8955,FINALE,"While the frantic bells went clashing clamorous, stroke on stroke."
8956,FINALE,"By the glare of her blazing roof-tree the houseless mother fled,"
8957,FINALE,With the babe she pressed to her bosom shrieking in nameless dread;
8958,FINALE,"While the fire-king's wild battalions scaled wall and cap-stone high,"
8959,FINALE,And painted their glaring banners against an inky sky.
8960,FINALE,"From the death that raged behind them, and the crush of ruin loud,"
8961,FINALE,"To the great square of the city, were driven the surging crowd,"
8962,FINALE,"Where yet firm in all the tumult, unscathed by the fiery flood,"
8963,FINALE,With its heavenward pointing finger the church of St. Michael's stood.
8964,FINALE,
8965,FINALE,"But e'en as they gazed upon it there rose a sudden wail,"
8966,FINALE,"A cry of horror blended with the roaring of the gale,"
8967,FINALE,"On whose scorching wings updriven, a single flaming brand,"
8968,FINALE,"Aloft on the towering steeple clung like a bloody hand,"
8969,FINALE,"""Will it fade?"" the whisper trembled from a thousand whitening lips;"
8970,FINALE,Far out on the lurid harbor they watched it from the ships.
8971,FINALE,"A baleful gleam, that brighter and ever brighter shone,"
8972,FINALE,"Like a flickering, trembling will-o'-the-wisp to a steady beacon grown."
8973,FINALE,"""Uncounted gold shall be given to the man whose brave right hand,"
8974,FINALE,"For the love of the periled city, plucks down yon burning brand!"""
8975,FINALE,"So cried the Mayor of Charleston, that all the people heard,"
8976,FINALE,"But they looked each one at his fellow, and no man spoke a word,"
8977,FINALE,"Who is it leans from the belfry, with face upturned to the sky--"
8978,FINALE,Clings to a column and measures the dizzy spire with his eye?
8979,FINALE,"Will he dare it, the hero undaunted, that terrible, sickening height,"
8980,FINALE,Or will the hot blood of his courage freeze in his veins at the sight?
8981,FINALE,"But see! he has stepped on the railing, he climbs with his feet and his"
8982,FINALE,"hands,"
8983,FINALE,"And firm on a narrow projection, with the belfry beneath him, he stands!"
8984,FINALE,"Now once, and once only, they cheer him--a single tempestuous breath,"
8985,FINALE,And there falls on the multitude gazing a hush like the stillness of death.
8986,FINALE,
8987,FINALE,"Slow, steadily mounting, unheeding aught save the goal of the fire,"
8988,FINALE,"Still higher and higher, an atom, he moves on the face of the spire:"
8989,FINALE,"He stops! Will he fall? Lo! for answer, a gleam like a meteor's track,"
8990,FINALE,"And, hurled on the stones of the pavement, the red brand lies shattered and"
8991,FINALE,black!
8992,FINALE,Once more the shouts of the people have rent the quivering air;
8993,FINALE,"At the church door mayor and council wait with their feet on the stair,"
8994,FINALE,And the eager throng behind them press for a touch of his hand--
8995,FINALE,The unknown savior whose daring could compass a deed so grand.
8996,FINALE,
8997,FINALE,But why does a sudden tremor seize on them as they gaze?
8998,FINALE,And what meaneth that stifled murmur of wonder and amaze?
8999,FINALE,"He stood in the gate of the temple he had periled his life to save,"
9000,FINALE,And the face of the unknown hero was the sable face of a slave!
9001,FINALE,"With folded arms he was speaking in tones that were clear, not loud,"
9002,FINALE,"And his eyes, ablaze in their sockets, burnt into the eyes of the crowd."
9003,FINALE,"""Ye may keep your gold, I scorn it! but answer me, ye who can,"
9004,FINALE,"If the deed I have done before you be not the deed of a _man?_"""
9005,FINALE,
9006,FINALE,"He stepped but a short space backward, and from all the women and men"
9007,FINALE,"There were only sobs for answer, and the mayor called for a pen,"
9008,FINALE,"And the great seal of the city, that he might read who ran,"
9009,FINALE,And the slave who saved St. Michael's went out from its door a man.

9027,FINALE,
9028,FINALE,"""Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around"
9029,FINALE,"To hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground,"
9030,FINALE,"That we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done,"
9031,FINALE,"Full many a corpse lay ghastly pale, beneath the setting sun."
9032,FINALE,"And 'midst the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,"
9033,FINALE,The death-wound on their gallant breasts the last of many scars:
9034,FINALE,But some were young--and suddenly beheld life's morn decline;
9035,FINALE,And one had come from Bingen--fair Bingen on the Rhine!
9036,FINALE,
9037,FINALE,"""Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age,"
9038,FINALE,"And I was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage:"
9039,FINALE,"For my father was a soldier, and even as a child"
9040,FINALE,My heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;
9041,FINALE,"And when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard,"
9042,FINALE,"I let them take whate'er they would, but kept my father's sword,"
9043,FINALE,"And with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine,"
9044,FINALE,On the cottage-wall at Bingen--calm Bingen on the Rhine!
9045,FINALE,
9046,FINALE,"""Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head,"
9047,FINALE,When the troops are marching home again with glad and gallant tread;
9048,FINALE,"But to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye,"
9049,FINALE,"For her brother was a soldier too, and not afraid to die."
9050,FINALE,"And if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name"
9051,FINALE,"To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame;"
9052,FINALE,"And to hang the old sword in its place (my father's sword and mine),"
9053,FINALE,For the honor of old Bingen--dear Bingen on the Rhine!
9054,FINALE,
9055,FINALE,"""There's another--not a sister; in the happy days gone by,"
9056,FINALE,You'd have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;
9057,FINALE,Too innocent for coquetry--too fond for idle scorning--
9058,FINALE,"Oh, friend! I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning;"
9059,FINALE,Tell her the last night of my life (for ere the moon be risen
9060,FINALE,"My body will be out of pain--my soul be out of prison),"
9061,FINALE,"I dreamed I stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine"
9062,FINALE,On the vine-clad hills of Bingen--fair Bingen on the Rhine!
9063,FINALE,
9064,FINALE,"""I saw the blue Rhine sweep along--I heard, or seemed to hear."
9065,FINALE,"The German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear;"
9066,FINALE,"And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill,"
9067,FINALE,"The echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still;"
9068,FINALE,And her glad blue eyes were on me as we passed with friendly talk
9069,FINALE,"Down many a path beloved of yore, and well-remembered walk,"
9070,FINALE,"And her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine:"
9071,FINALE,"But we'll meet no more at Bingen--loved Bingen on the Rhine!"""
9072,FINALE,
9073,FINALE,"His voice grew faint and hoarser,--his grasp was childish weak,--"
9074,FINALE,"His eyes put on a dying look,--he sighed and ceased to speak;"
9075,FINALE,"His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled,--"
9076,FINALE,"The soldier of the Legion, in a foreign land--was dead!"
9077,FINALE,"And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down"
9078,FINALE,"On the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corpses strown;"
9079,FINALE,"Yea, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light seemed to shine"

9092,FINALE,Round the board a group is seated; here and there are threads of white
9093,FINALE,Which their dark locks lately welcomed; but they're only boys tonight.
9094,FINALE,"Some whose words have thrilled the senate, some who win the critic's"

9098,FINALE,"""Boys,"" said one, ""do you remember that old joke--about the wine--"
9099,FINALE,How we used to fill our oil cans and repair to 'No. 9'?
9100,FINALE,But at last the old professor--never long was he outdone--
9101,FINALE,"Opened up our shining oil cans and demolished all our fun!"""
9102,FINALE,"In the laugh that rings so gayly through the richly curtained room,"

9104,FINALE,Tremble in its vase of silver? Does he see the ruddy wine
9105,FINALE,"Shiver in its crystal goblet, or do those grave eyes divine"
9106,FINALE,"Something sadder yet? He pauses till their mirth has died away,"
9107,FINALE,Then in measured tones speaks gravely:
9108,FINALE,"""Boys, a story, if I may, I will tell you, though it may not merit"
9109,FINALE,"worthily your praise,"
9110,FINALE,"It is bitter fruitage ripened from our pranks of college days,"""
9111,FINALE,

9116,FINALE,"At the San Francisco L---- House, when I heard a plaintive moan"
9117,FINALE,Sounding from the room adjoining. Hoping to give some relief
9118,FINALE,"To the suffering one, I entered; but it thrilled my heart with grief"
9119,FINALE,"Just to see that wreck of manhood--bloated face, disheveled hair--"
9120,FINALE,"Wildly tossing, ever moaning, while his thin hands beat the air."
9121,FINALE,"Broken prayers, vile oaths and curses filled the air as I drew near;"
9122,FINALE,"Then in faint and piteous accents, these words I could plainly hear:"
9123,FINALE,'Give me one more chance--one only--let me see my little Belle--
9124,FINALE,"Then I'll follow where they lead me, be it to the depths of hell!'"
9125,FINALE,"When he saw me he grew calmer, started strangely--looked me o'er--"
9126,FINALE,"Oh, the glory of expression! I had seen those eyes before!"
9127,FINALE,"Yes, I knew him; it was Horace, he who won the college prize;"
9128,FINALE,Naught remained of his proud beauty but the splendor of his eyes.
9129,FINALE,"He whom we were all so proud of, lay there in the fading light."
9130,FINALE,"If my years should number fourscore, I shall ne'er forget that sight."
9131,FINALE,"And he knew me--called me 'Albert,' ere a single word I'd said--"
9132,FINALE,We were comrades in the old days; I sat down beside the bed.
9133,FINALE,
9134,FINALE,"""Horace seemed to grow more quiet, but he would not go to sleep;"
9135,FINALE,He kept talking of our boyhood while my hand he still would keep
9136,FINALE,"In his own so white and wasted, and with burning eyes would gaze"
9137,FINALE,"On my face, still talking feebly of the dear old college days."
9138,FINALE,"'Ah,' he said, 'life held such promise; but, alas! I am to-day"
9139,FINALE,"But a poor degraded outcast--hopes, ambition swept away,"
9140,FINALE,And it dates back to those oil cans that we filled in greatest glee.
9141,FINALE,Little did I think in those days what the harvest now would be!'
9142,FINALE,
9143,FINALE,"""For a moment he was silent, then a cry whose anguish yet"
9144,FINALE,"Wrings my heart, burst from his white lips, though his teeth were tightly"
9145,FINALE,"set,"
9146,FINALE,"And with sudden strength he started--sprang from my detaining arm,"
9147,FINALE,"Shrieking wildly, 'Curse the demons; do they think to do me harm?"
9148,FINALE,"Back! I say, ye forked-tongued serpents reeking with the filth of hell!"
9149,FINALE,Don't ye see I have her with me--my poor sainted little Belle?'
9150,FINALE,
9151,FINALE,"""When I'd soothed him into quiet, with a trembling arm he drew"
9152,FINALE,"My head down, 'Oh, Al,' he whispered, 'such remorse you never knew.'"
9153,FINALE,"And again I tried to soothe him, but my eyes o'erbrimmed with tears;"
9154,FINALE,"His were dry and clear, as brilliant as they were in college years."
9155,FINALE,"All the flush had left his features, he lay white as marble now;"
9156,FINALE,"Tenderly I smoothed his pillow, wiped the moisture from his brow."
9157,FINALE,"Though I begged him to be quiet, he would talk of those old days,"
9158,FINALE,"Brokenly at times, but always of 'the boys' with loving praise."
9159,FINALE,
9160,FINALE,"""Once I asked him of Lorena--the sweet girl whom he had wed--"
9161,FINALE,"You remember Rena Barstow. When I asked if she were dead,"
9162,FINALE,"'No,' he said, his poor voice faltering, 'she is far beyond the Rhine,"
9163,FINALE,"But I wish, to God, it were so, and I still might call her mine."
9164,FINALE,"She's divorced--she's mine no longer,' here his voice grew weak and hoarse"
9165,FINALE,"'But although I am a drunkard, _I have one they can't divorce_."
9166,FINALE,"I've a little girl in heaven, playing round the Savior's knee,"

9171,FINALE,"She would say, ""Now stop, dear papa, for I know you can stop _now_."""
9172,FINALE,"I would promise, kiss my darling, and the next day break my vow."
9173,FINALE,"So it went until one Christmas, dark and stormy, cold and drear;"
9174,FINALE,"Out I started, just as usual, for the cursed rum shop near,"
9175,FINALE,"And my darling followed after, in the storm of rain and sleet,"
9176,FINALE,"With no covering wrapped about her, naught but slippers on her feet;"
9177,FINALE,"No one knew it, no one missed her, till there came with solemn tread,"
9178,FINALE,"Stern-faced men unto our dwelling, bringing back our darling--_dead!_"
9179,FINALE,"They had found her cold and lifeless, like, they said, an angel fair,"
9180,FINALE,"Leaning 'gainst the grog shop window--oh, she thought that _I was there!_"
9181,FINALE,"Then he raised his arms toward heaven, called aloud unto the dead,"
9182,FINALE,"For his mind again was wandering: 'Belle, my precious Belle!' he said,"
9183,FINALE,"'Papa's treasure--papa's darling! oh, my baby--did--you--come"
9184,FINALE,All the way--alone--my darling--just to lead--poor--papa--home?'
9185,FINALE,"And he surely had an answer, for a silence o'er him fell."
9186,FINALE,"And I sat alone and lonely--death had come with little Belle."""
9187,FINALE,
9188,FINALE,Silence in that princely parlor--head of every guest is bowed.
9189,FINALE,"They still see the red wine sparkle, but 'tis through a misty cloud."
9190,FINALE,"Said the host at last, arising, ""I have scorned the pledge to sign,"
9191,FINALE,Laughed at temperance all my life long. Never more shall drop of wine
9192,FINALE,"Touch my lips. The fruit _was_ bitter, boys; 'twas I proposed it first--"
9193,FINALE,That foul joke from which poor Horace ever bore a life accurst!
9194,FINALE,"Let us pledge ourselves to-night, boys, never more by word, or deed,"
9195,FINALE,"In our own fair homes, or elsewhere, help to plant the poison seed."""

9211,FINALE,The grain lie rotting on the ground.
9212,FINALE,
9213,FINALE,Every day the starving poor
9214,FINALE,"Crowded round Bishop Hatto's door,"
9215,FINALE,"For he had a plentiful last year's store,"
9216,FINALE,And all the neighborhood could tell
9217,FINALE,His granaries were furnish'd well.
9218,FINALE,
9219,FINALE,At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day
9220,FINALE,To quiet the poor without delay;
9221,FINALE,"He bade them to his great barn repair,"
9222,FINALE,And they should have food for the winter there.
9223,FINALE,
9224,FINALE,"Rejoiced the tidings good to hear,"

9226,FINALE,The great barn was full as it could hold
9227,FINALE,"Of women and children, and young and old."
9228,FINALE,
9229,FINALE,"Then, when he saw it could hold no more,"
9230,FINALE,"Bishop Hatto he made fast the door,"
9231,FINALE,"And while for mercy on Christ they call,"
9232,FINALE,He set fire to the barn and burnt them all.
9233,FINALE,
9234,FINALE,"""I' faith, 'tis an excellent bonfire!"" quoth he,"

9242,FINALE,But Bishop Hatto never slept again.
9243,FINALE,
9244,FINALE,"In the morning, as he enter'd the hall"
9245,FINALE,"Where his picture hung against the wall,"
9246,FINALE,"A sweat like death all over him came,"
9247,FINALE,For the rats had eaten it out of the frame.
9248,FINALE,
9249,FINALE,"As he look'd, there came a man from his farm,"
9250,FINALE,He had a countenance white with alarm:
9251,FINALE,"""My lord, I open'd your granaries this morn,"
9252,FINALE,"And the rats had eaten all your corn."""
9253,FINALE,
9254,FINALE,"Another came running presently,"

9265,FINALE,"Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,"

9267,FINALE,And reach'd his tower and barr'd with care
9268,FINALE,"All the windows, doors, and loopholes there."
9269,FINALE,
9270,FINALE,"He laid him down and closed his eyes,"
9271,FINALE,But soon a scream made him arise;
9272,FINALE,"He started, and saw two eyes of flame"
9273,FINALE,"On his pillow, from whence the screaming came."
9274,FINALE,
9275,FINALE,"He listen'd and look'd,--it was only the cat,"
9276,FINALE,"But the bishop he grew more fearful for that,"
9277,FINALE,"For she sat screaming, mad with fear"
9278,FINALE,At the army of rats that were drawing near.
9279,FINALE,
9280,FINALE,"For they have swum over the river so deep,"
9281,FINALE,"And they have climb'd the shores so steep,"
9282,FINALE,"And up the tower their way is bent,"
9283,FINALE,To do the work for which they were sent.
9284,FINALE,
9285,FINALE,They are not to be told by the dozen or score;
9286,FINALE,"By thousands they come, and by myriads and more;"

9288,FINALE,Such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore. |
9289,FINALE,
9290,FINALE,"Down on his knees the bishop fell,"
9291,FINALE,"And faster and faster his beads did he tell,"
9292,FINALE,"As louder and louder, drawing near,"
9293,FINALE,The gnawing of their teeth he could hear.
9294,FINALE,
9295,FINALE,"And in at the windows and in at the door,"
9296,FINALE,And through the walls helter-skelter they pour;

9298,FINALE,
9299,FINALE,"From the right and the left, from behind and before,"
9300,FINALE,"From within and without, from above and below,--"
9301,FINALE,And all at once to the bishop they go.
9302,FINALE,
9303,FINALE,"They have whetted their teeth against the stones,"

9346,FINALE,
9347,FINALE,"Nearer to the trembling watchers came the wreck tossed by the wave,"

9362,FINALE,
9363,FINALE,"He could have no other refuge,--""Hangs my helpless soul on thee."""

9400,FINALE,"To pick up the victims who fell off the cliff,"
9401,FINALE,With their ambulance down in the valley.

9416,FINALE,Aren't we picking up folks just as fast as they fall?
9417,FINALE,And shall this man dictate to us? Shall he?

9419,FINALE,"While the ambulance works in the valley?"""
9420,FINALE,
9421,FINALE,"But a sensible few, who are practical too,"
9422,FINALE,Will not bear with such nonsense much longer;
9423,FINALE,"They believe that prevention is better than cure,"
9424,FINALE,And their party will soon be the stronger.

9426,FINALE,"And while other philanthropists dally,"
9427,FINALE,They will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence
9428,FINALE,On the cliff that hangs over the valley.

9431,FINALE,"For the voice of true wisdom is calling,"

9497,FINALE,Ever made by the Hand above--
9498,FINALE,"A woman's heart and a woman's life,"
9499,FINALE,And a woman's wonderful love?
9500,FINALE,
9501,FINALE,Do you know you have asked for this priceless thing
9502,FINALE,As a child might ask for a toy;
9503,FINALE,"Demanding what others have died to win,"
9504,FINALE,With the reckless dash of a boy?
9505,FINALE,
9506,FINALE,"You have written my lesson of duty out,"
9507,FINALE,Man-like you have questioned me--

9515,FINALE,
9516,FINALE,You require a cook for your mutton and beef;
9517,FINALE,I require a far better thing--
9518,FINALE,A seamstress you're wanting for stockings and shirts--
9519,FINALE,I look for a man and a king.

9552,FINALE,
9553,FINALE,
9554,FINALE,I want free life and I want fresh air;
9555,FINALE,"And I sigh for the canter after the cattle,"
9556,FINALE,"The crack of the whips like shots in battle,"
9557,FINALE,"The mellay of horns, and hoofs, and heads"
9558,FINALE,"That wars, and wrangles, and scatters, and spreads;"

9560,FINALE,"And dash and danger, and life and love;"
9561,FINALE,And Lasca!
9562,FINALE,Lasca used to ride
9563,FINALE,"On a mouse-gray mustang, close to my side,"
9564,FINALE,With blue _serape_ and bright-belled spur;
9565,FINALE,I laughed with joy as I looked at her!
9566,FINALE,Little knew she of books or creeds;
9567,FINALE,An _Ave Maria_ sufficed her needs;
9568,FINALE,"Little she cared, save to be by my side,"
9569,FINALE,"To ride with me, and ever to ride,"
9570,FINALE,From San Saba's shore to Lavaca's tide.
9571,FINALE,"She was as bold as the billows that beat,"
9572,FINALE,She was as wild as the breezes that blow;
9573,FINALE,From her little head to her little feet
9574,FINALE,"She was swayed, in her suppleness, to and fro"
9575,FINALE,"By each gust of passion; a sapling pine,"
9576,FINALE,That grows on the edge of a Kansas bluff
9577,FINALE,"And wars with the wind when the weather is rough,"
9578,FINALE,"Is like this Lasca, this love of mine."
9579,FINALE,"She would hunger that I might eat,"
9580,FINALE,Would take the bitter and leave me the sweet;
9581,FINALE,"But once, when I made her jealous for fun,"
9582,FINALE,"At something I'd whispered, or looked, or done,"
9583,FINALE,"One Sunday, in San Antonio,"
9584,FINALE,"To a glorious girl on the Alamo,"
9585,FINALE,"She drew from her girdle a dear little dagger,"
9586,FINALE,And--sting of a wasp!--it made me stagger!
9587,FINALE,"An inch to the left or an inch to the right,"
9588,FINALE,And I shouldn't be maundering here to-night;
9589,FINALE,"But she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound"
9590,FINALE,Her torn _rebosa_ about the wound
9591,FINALE,That I quite forgave her. Scratches don't count
9592,FINALE,"In Texas, down by the Rio Grande."
9593,FINALE,
9594,FINALE,"Her eye was brown,--a deep, deep brown;"
9595,FINALE,Her hair was darker than her eye;
9596,FINALE,"And something in her smile and frown,"
9597,FINALE,"Curled crimson lip, and instep high,"
9598,FINALE,"Showed that there ran in each blue vein,"
9599,FINALE,"Mixed with the milder Aztec strain,"
9600,FINALE,The vigorous vintage of old Spain.
9601,FINALE,She was alive in every limb
9602,FINALE,"With feeling, to the finger tips;"
9603,FINALE,"And when the sun is like a fire,"
9604,FINALE,"And sky one shining, soft sapphire,"
9605,FINALE,One does not drink in little sips.
9606,FINALE,
9607,FINALE,"The air was heavy, the night was hot,"
9608,FINALE,"I sat by her side, and forgot--forgot;"
9609,FINALE,Forgot the herd that were taking their rest;
9610,FINALE,Forgot that the air was close opprest;
9611,FINALE,"That the Texas norther comes sudden and soon,"
9612,FINALE,In the dead of night or the blaze of noon;
9613,FINALE,"That once let the herd at its breath take fright,"
9614,FINALE,That nothing on earth can stop the flight;
9615,FINALE,"And woe to the rider, and woe to the steed,"
9616,FINALE,Who falls in front of their mad stampede!
9617,FINALE,"Was that thunder? No, by the Lord!"
9618,FINALE,"I sprang to my saddle without a word,"
9619,FINALE,"One foot on mine, and she clung behind."
9620,FINALE,Away on a hot chase down the wind!
9621,FINALE,"But never was fox-hunt half so hard,"
9622,FINALE,"And never was steed so little spared,"
9623,FINALE,For we rode for our lives. You shall hear how we fared
9624,FINALE,"In Texas, down by the Rio Grande."
9625,FINALE,
9626,FINALE,"The mustang flew, and we urged him on;"
9627,FINALE,"There was one chance left, and you have but one;"
9628,FINALE,"Halt, jump to the ground, and shoot your horse;"
9629,FINALE,"Crouch under his carcass, and take your chance;"
9630,FINALE,"And if the steers, in their frantic course,"
9631,FINALE,"Don't batter you both to pieces at once,"
9632,FINALE,"You may thank your star; if not, good-by"
9633,FINALE,"To the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh,"
9634,FINALE,"And the open air and the open sky,"
9635,FINALE,"In Texas, down by the Rio Grande."
9636,FINALE,
9637,FINALE,"The cattle gained on us, and just as I felt"
9638,FINALE,"For my old six-shooter, behind in my belt,"
9639,FINALE,"Down came the mustang, and down came we,"
9640,FINALE,"Clinging together, and--what was the rest?"
9641,FINALE,"A body that spread itself on my breast,"
9642,FINALE,"Two arms that shielded my dizzy head,"
9643,FINALE,Two lips that hard on my lips were pressed;
9644,FINALE,"Then came thunder in my ears,"
9645,FINALE,"As over us surged the sea of steers,"
9646,FINALE,"Blows that beat blood into my eyes,"
9647,FINALE,"And when I could rise,"
9648,FINALE,Lasca was dead!
9649,FINALE,
9650,FINALE,"I gouged out a grave a few feet deep,"
9651,FINALE,And there in Earth's arms I laid her to sleep!
9652,FINALE,"And there she is lying, and no one knows,"
9653,FINALE,And the summer shines and the winter snows;
9654,FINALE,For many a day the flowers have spread
9655,FINALE,A pall of petals over her head;
9656,FINALE,"And the little gray hawk hangs aloft in the air,"
9657,FINALE,"And the sly coyote trots here and there,"
9658,FINALE,"And the black snake glides, and glitters, and slides"
9659,FINALE,Into the rift in a cotton-wood tree;
9660,FINALE,"And the buzzard sails on,"
9661,FINALE,"And comes and is gone,"
9662,FINALE,Stately and still like a ship at sea;
9663,FINALE,And I wonder why I do not care
9664,FINALE,For the things that are like the things that were.
9665,FINALE,Does half my heart lie buried there
9666,FINALE,"In Texas, down by the Rio Grande?"

9675,FINALE,
9676,FINALE,Over the hill to the poor-house I'm trudgin' my weary way--
9677,FINALE,"I, a woman of seventy, and only a trifle gray--"
9678,FINALE,"I, who am smart an' chipper, for all the years I've told,"
9679,FINALE,As many another woman that's only half as old.
9680,FINALE,
9681,FINALE,Over the hill to the poor-house--I can't quite make it clear!
9682,FINALE,Over the hill to the poor-house-it seems so horrid queer!
9683,FINALE,"Many a step I've taken a-toiling to and fro,"
9684,FINALE,But this is a sort of journey I never thought to go.
9685,FINALE,
9686,FINALE,What is the use of heapin' on me a pauper's shame?
9687,FINALE,Am I lazy or crazy? Am I blind or lame?
9688,FINALE,"True, I am not so supple, nor yet so awful stout;"
9689,FINALE,"But charity ain't no favor, if one can live without."
9690,FINALE,
9691,FINALE,I am willin' and anxious an' ready any day
9692,FINALE,"To work for a decent livin', an' pay my honest way;"
9693,FINALE,"For I can earn my victuals, an' more too, I'll be bound,"
9694,FINALE,If anybody only is willin' to have me round.
9695,FINALE,
9696,FINALE,Once I was young an' han'some--I was upon my soul--
9697,FINALE,"Once my cheeks was roses, my eyes as black as coal;"
9698,FINALE,"And I can't remember, in them days, of hearin' people say,"
9699,FINALE,"For any kind of a reason, that I was in their way."
9700,FINALE,
9701,FINALE,"'Tain't no use of boastin', or talkin' over-free,"
9702,FINALE,But many a house an' home was open then to me;
9703,FINALE,"Many a han'some offer I had from likely men,"
9704,FINALE,And nobody ever hinted that I was a burden then.
9705,FINALE,
9706,FINALE,"And when to John I was married, sure he was good and smart,"
9707,FINALE,But he and all the neighbors would own I done my part;
9708,FINALE,"For life was all before me, an' I was young an' strong,"
9709,FINALE,And I worked the best that I could in tryin' to get along.
9710,FINALE,
9711,FINALE,"And so we worked together: and life was hard, but gay,"
9712,FINALE,With now and then a baby for to cheer us on our way;
9713,FINALE,"Till we had half a dozen, an' all growed clean an' neat,"
9714,FINALE,"An' went to school like others, an' had enough to eat."
9715,FINALE,
9716,FINALE,"So we worked for the childr'n, and raised 'em every one,"
9717,FINALE,Worked for 'em summer and winter just as we ought to've done;
9718,FINALE,"Only, perhaps, we humored 'em, which some good folks condemn--"
9719,FINALE,But every couple's childr'n's a heap the best to them.
9720,FINALE,
9721,FINALE,Strange how much we think of our blessed little ones!
9722,FINALE,"I'd have died for my daughters, I'd have died for my sons;"
9723,FINALE,"And God he made that rule of love; but when we're old and gray,"
9724,FINALE,"I've noticed it sometimes, somehow, fails to work the other way."
9725,FINALE,
9726,FINALE,"Strange, another thing: when our boys an' girls was grown,"
9727,FINALE,"And when, exceptin' Charley, they'd left us there alone;"
9728,FINALE,"When John he nearer an' nearer come, an' dearer seemed to be,"
9729,FINALE,"The Lord of Hosts he come one day, an' took him away from me."
9730,FINALE,
9731,FINALE,"Still I was bound to struggle, an' never to cringe or fall--"
9732,FINALE,"Still I worked for Charley, for Charley was now my all;"
9733,FINALE,"And Charley was pretty good to me, with scarce a word or frown,"
9734,FINALE,"Till at last he went a-courtin', and brought a wife from town."
9735,FINALE,
9736,FINALE,"She was somewhat dressy, an' hadn't a pleasant smile--"
9737,FINALE,"She was quite conceity, and carried a heap o' style;"
9738,FINALE,"But if ever I tried to be friends, I did with her, I know;"
9739,FINALE,"But she was hard and proud, an' I couldn't make it go."
9740,FINALE,
9741,FINALE,"She had an edication, an' that was good for her;"
9742,FINALE,"But when she twitted me on mine, 'twas carryin' things too fur;"
9743,FINALE,"An' I told her once, 'fore company (an' it almost made her sick),"
9744,FINALE,"That I never swallowed a grammar, or eat a 'rithmetic."
9745,FINALE,
9746,FINALE,So 'twas only a few days before the thing was done--
9747,FINALE,"They was a family of themselves, and I another one;"
9748,FINALE,"And a very little cottage one family will do,"
9749,FINALE,But I never have seen a house that was big enough for two.
9750,FINALE,
9751,FINALE,"An' I never could speak to suit her, never could please her eye,"
9752,FINALE,"An' it made me independent, an' then I didn't try;"
9753,FINALE,"But I was terribly staggered, an' felt it like a blow,"
9754,FINALE,"When Charley turn'd agin me, an' told me I could go."
9755,FINALE,
9756,FINALE,"I went to live with Susan, but Susan's house was small,"
9757,FINALE,And she was always a-hintin' how snug it was for us all;
9758,FINALE,"And what with her husband's sisters, and what with childr'n three,"
9759,FINALE,'Twas easy to discover that there wasn't room for me.
9760,FINALE,
9761,FINALE,"An' then I went to Thomas, the oldest son I've got,"
9762,FINALE,For Thomas's buildings'd cover the half of an acre lot;
9763,FINALE,But all the childr'n was on me--I couldn't stand their sauce--
9764,FINALE,And Thomas said I needn't think I was comin' there to boss.
9765,FINALE,
9766,FINALE,"An' then I wrote Rebecca, my girl who lives out West,"
9767,FINALE,"And to Isaac, not far from her--some twenty miles, at best;"
9768,FINALE,"And one of 'em said 'twas too warm there for any one so old,"
9769,FINALE,And t'other had an opinion the climate was too cold.
9770,FINALE,
9771,FINALE,"So they have shirked and slighted me, an' shifted me about--"
9772,FINALE,"So they have well-nigh soured me, an' wore my old heart out;"
9773,FINALE,"But still I've borne up pretty well, an' wasn't much put down,"
9774,FINALE,"Till Charley went to the poor-master, an' put me on the town."
9775,FINALE,
9776,FINALE,"Over the hill to the poor-house--my childr'n dear, good-by!"
9777,FINALE,Many a night I've watched you when only God was nigh;
9778,FINALE,And God'll judge between us; but I will always pray
9779,FINALE,That you shall never suffer the half I do to-day.

9917,FINALE,
9918,FINALE,"NOTE: A remarkable custom, brought from the Old Country, formerly"
9919,FINALE,prevailed in the rural districts of New England. On the death of a
9920,FINALE,"member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event, and"
9921,FINALE,their hives dressed in mourning. This ceremonial was supposed to be
9922,FINALE,necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
9923,FINALE,new home.
9924,FINALE,
9925,FINALE,
9926,FINALE,Here is the place; right over the hill
9927,FINALE,Runs the path I took;
9928,FINALE,You can see the gap in the old wall still.
9929,FINALE,And the stepping-stones in the shallow brook.
9930,FINALE,
9931,FINALE,"There is the house, with the gate red-barred,"
9932,FINALE,And the poplars tall;
9933,FINALE,"And the barn's brown length, and the cattle-yard,"
9934,FINALE,And the white horns tossing above the wall.
9935,FINALE,
9936,FINALE,There are the beehives ranged in the sun;
9937,FINALE,And down by the brink
9938,FINALE,"Of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun,"
9939,FINALE,"Pansy and daffodil, rose and pink."
9940,FINALE,
9941,FINALE,"A year has gone, as the tortoise goes,"
9942,FINALE,Heavy and slow;
9943,FINALE,"And the same rose blows, and the same sun glows,"
9944,FINALE,And the same brook sings of a year ago.
9945,FINALE,
9946,FINALE,There's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze;
9947,FINALE,And the June sun warm
9948,FINALE,"Tangles his wings of fire in the trees,"
9949,FINALE,"Setting, as then, over Fernside farm."
9950,FINALE,
9951,FINALE,I mind me how with a lover's care
9952,FINALE,From my Sunday coat
9953,FINALE,"I brushed off the burs, and smoothed my hair,"
9954,FINALE,And cooled at the brookside my brow and throat.
9955,FINALE,
9956,FINALE,"Since we parted, a month had passed,--"
9957,FINALE,"To love, a year;"
9958,FINALE,Down through the beeches I looked at last
9959,FINALE,On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.
9960,FINALE,
9961,FINALE,"I can see it all now,--the slantwise rain"
9962,FINALE,"Of light through the leaves,"
9963,FINALE,"The sundown's blaze on her window-pane,"
9964,FINALE,The bloom of her roses under the eaves.
9965,FINALE,
9966,FINALE,"Just the same as a month before,--"
9967,FINALE,"The house and the trees,"
9968,FINALE,"The barn's brown gable, the vine by the door,--"
9969,FINALE,Nothing changed but the hives of bees.
9970,FINALE,
9971,FINALE,"Before them, under the garden wall,"
9972,FINALE,"Forward and back,"
9973,FINALE,"Went drearily singing the chore-girl small,"
9974,FINALE,Draping each hive with a shred of black.
9975,FINALE,
9976,FINALE,"Trembling, I listened; the summer sun"
9977,FINALE,Had the chill of snow;
9978,FINALE,For I knew she was telling the bees of one
9979,FINALE,Gone on the journey we all must go!
9980,FINALE,
9981,FINALE,"Then I said to myself, ""My Mary weeps"
9982,FINALE,For the dead to-day:
9983,FINALE,Haply her blind grandsire sleeps
9984,FINALE,"The fret and pain of his age away."""
9985,FINALE,
9986,FINALE,"But her dog whined low; on the doorway sill,"
9987,FINALE,"With his cane to his chin,"
9988,FINALE,The old man sat; and the chore-girl still
9989,FINALE,Sung to the bees stealing out and in.
9990,FINALE,
9991,FINALE,And the song she was singing ever since
9992,FINALE,In my ear sounds on:--
9993,FINALE,"""Stay at home, pretty bees, fly not hence!"
9994,FINALE,"Mistress Mary is dead and gone!"""

10262,FINALE,"But four young Oysters hurried up,"
10263,FINALE,All eager for the treat:
10264,FINALE,"Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,"
10265,FINALE,Their shoes were clean and neat--
10266,FINALE,"And this was odd, because, you know,"
10267,FINALE,They hadn't any feet.
10268,FINALE,
10269,FINALE,"Four other Oysters followed them,"
10270,FINALE,And yet another four;
10271,FINALE,"And thick and fast they came at last,"
10272,FINALE,"And more, and more, and more--"
10273,FINALE,"All hopping through the frothy waves,"
10274,FINALE,And scrambling to the shore.
10275,FINALE,
10276,FINALE,The Walrus and the Carpenter
10277,FINALE,"Walked on a mile or so,"
10278,FINALE,And then they rested on a rock
10279,FINALE,Conveniently low:
10280,FINALE,And all the little Oysters stood
10281,FINALE,And waited in a row.
10282,FINALE,
10283,FINALE,"""The time has come,"" the Walrus said,"
10284,FINALE,"""To talk of many things:"
10285,FINALE,Of shoes--and ships--and sealing-wax--
10286,FINALE,Of cabbages and kings--
10287,FINALE,And why the sea is boiling hot--
10288,FINALE,"And whether pigs have wings."""
10289,FINALE,
10290,FINALE,"""But wait a bit,"" the Oysters cried,"

10293,FINALE,"And all of us are fat!"""
10294,FINALE,"""No hurry!"" said the Carpenter."

10296,FINALE,
10297,FINALE,"""A loaf of bread,"" the Walrus said,"
10298,FINALE,"""Is what we chiefly need:"
10299,FINALE,Pepper and vinegar besides
10300,FINALE,Are very good indeed--
10301,FINALE,"Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,"
10302,FINALE,"We can begin to feed."""
10303,FINALE,
10304,FINALE,"""But not on us!"" the Oysters cried,"
10305,FINALE,Turning a little blue.
10306,FINALE,"""After such kindness, that would be"
10307,FINALE,"A dismal thing to do!"""
10308,FINALE,"""The night is fine,"" the Walrus said,"
10309,FINALE,"""Do you admire the view?"
10310,FINALE,
10311,FINALE,"""It was so kind of you to come!"
10312,FINALE,"And you are very nice!"""
10313,FINALE,The Carpenter said nothing but
10314,FINALE,"""Cut us another slice."
10315,FINALE,I wish you were not quite so deaf--
10316,FINALE,"I've had to ask you twice!"""
10317,FINALE,
10318,FINALE,"""It seems a shame,"" the Walrus said,"
10319,FINALE,"""To play them such a trick."
10320,FINALE,"After we've brought them out so far,"
10321,FINALE,"And made them trot so quick!"""
10322,FINALE,The Carpenter said nothing but
10323,FINALE,"""The butter's spread too thick!"""
10324,FINALE,
10325,FINALE,"""I weep for you,"" the Walrus said;"
10326,FINALE,"""I deeply sympathize."""
10327,FINALE,With sobs and tears he sorted out
10328,FINALE,"Those of the largest size,"
10329,FINALE,Holding his pocket-handkerchief
10330,FINALE,Before his streaming eyes.
10331,FINALE,
10332,FINALE,"""O Oysters,"" said the Carpenter,"
10333,FINALE,"""You've had a pleasant run!"
10334,FINALE,"Shall we be trotting home again?"""
10335,FINALE,But answer came there none--

10350,FINALE,The boys and girls were gone.
10351,FINALE,
10352,FINALE,The weary teacher sat alone;
10353,FINALE,Unnerved and pale was he;
10354,FINALE,"Bowed 'neath a yoke of care, he spoke"
10355,FINALE,In sad soliloquy:
10356,FINALE,
10357,FINALE,"""Another round, another round"
10358,FINALE,"Of labor thrown away,"

10371,FINALE,
10372,FINALE,"He sighed, and low upon his hands"

10374,FINALE,And o'er his frame ere long there came
10375,FINALE,A soothing sense of rest.
10376,FINALE,
10377,FINALE,"And then he lifted up his face,"
10378,FINALE,"But started back aghast,--"
10379,FINALE,"The room, by strange and sudden change,"
10380,FINALE,Assumed proportions vast.
10381,FINALE,
10382,FINALE,"It seemed a Senate-hall, and one"
10383,FINALE,Addressed a listening throng;
10384,FINALE,"Each burning word all bosoms stirred,"
10385,FINALE,Applause rose loud and long.

10448,FINALE,
10449,FINALE,
10450,FINALE,"Girt round with rugged mountains, the fair Lake Constance lies;"
10451,FINALE,In her blue heart reflected shine back the starry skies;
10452,FINALE,"And watching each white cloudlet float silently and slow,"
10453,FINALE,You think a piece of heaven lies on our earth below!
10454,FINALE,
10455,FINALE,"Midnight is there: and silence, enthroned in heaven, looks down"
10456,FINALE,"Upon her own calm mirror, upon a sleeping town:"
10457,FINALE,"For Bregenz, that quaint city upon the Tyrol shore,"
10458,FINALE,Has stood above Lake Constance a thousand years and more.
10459,FINALE,
10460,FINALE,"Her battlement and towers, from off their rocky steep,"
10461,FINALE,Have cast their trembling shadow for ages on the deep;
10462,FINALE,"Mountain, and lake, and valley, a sacred legend know,"
10463,FINALE,"Of how the town was saved, one night three hundred years ago."
10464,FINALE,
10465,FINALE,"Far from her home and kindred, a Tyrol maid had fled,"
10466,FINALE,"To serve in the Swiss valleys, and toil for daily bread;"
10467,FINALE,"And every year that fleeted so silently and fast,"
10468,FINALE,Seemed to bear farther from her the memory of the past.
10469,FINALE,
10470,FINALE,"She served kind, gentle masters, nor asked for rest or change;"
10471,FINALE,"Her friends seemed no more new ones, their speech seemed no more strange;"
10472,FINALE,"And when she led her cattle to pasture every day,"
10473,FINALE,She ceased to look and wonder on which side Bregenz lay.
10474,FINALE,
10475,FINALE,"She spoke no more of Bregenz, with longing and with tears;"
10476,FINALE,Her Tyrol home seemed faded in a deep mist of years;
10477,FINALE,She heeded not the rumors of Austrian war and strife;
10478,FINALE,"Each day she rose, contented, to the calm toils of life."
10479,FINALE,
10480,FINALE,"Yet when her master's children would clustering round her stand,"
10481,FINALE,She sang them ancient ballads of her own native land;
10482,FINALE,"And when at morn and evening she knelt before God's throne,"
10483,FINALE,The accents of her childhood rose to her lips alone.
10484,FINALE,
10485,FINALE,And so she dwelt: the valley more peaceful year by year;
10486,FINALE,When suddenly strange portents of some great deed seemed near.
10487,FINALE,"The golden corn was bending upon its fragile stock,"
10488,FINALE,"While farmers, heedless of their fields, paced up and down in talk."
10489,FINALE,
10490,FINALE,"The men seemed stern and altered, with looks cast on the ground;"
10491,FINALE,"With anxious faces, one by one, the women gathered round;"
10492,FINALE,"All talk of flax, or spinning, or work, was put away;"
10493,FINALE,The very children seemed afraid to go alone to play.
10494,FINALE,
10495,FINALE,"One day, out in the meadow with strangers from the town,"
10496,FINALE,"Some secret plan discussing, the men walked up and down,"
10497,FINALE,"Yet now and then seemed watching a strange uncertain, gleam,"
10498,FINALE,That looked like lances 'mid the trees that stood below the stream.
10499,FINALE,
10500,FINALE,"At eve they all assembled, then care and doubt were fled;"
10501,FINALE,With jovial laugh they feasted; the board was nobly spread.
10502,FINALE,"The elder of the village rose up, his glass in hand,"
10503,FINALE,"And cried, ""We drink the downfall of an accursed land!"
10504,FINALE,
10505,FINALE,"""The night is growing darker,--ere one more day is flown,"
10506,FINALE,"Bregenz, our foeman's stronghold, Bregenz shall be our own!"""
10507,FINALE,"The women shrank in terror, (yet Pride, too, had her part,)"
10508,FINALE,But one poor Tyrol maiden felt death within her heart.
10509,FINALE,
10510,FINALE,"Before her stood fair Bregenz, once more her towers arose;"
10511,FINALE,What were the friends beside her? Only her country's foes!
10512,FINALE,"The faces of her kinsfolk, the days of childhood flown,"
10513,FINALE,"The echoes of her mountains, reclaimed her as their own!"
10514,FINALE,
10515,FINALE,"Nothing she heard around her, (though shouts rang forth again,)"
10516,FINALE,"Gone were the green Swiss valleys, the pasture, and the plain;"
10517,FINALE,"Before her eyes one vision, and in her heart one cry,"
10518,FINALE,"That said, ""Go forth, save Bregenz, and then, if need be, die!"""
10519,FINALE,
10520,FINALE,"With trembling haste and breathless, with noiseless step, she sped;"
10521,FINALE,Horses and weary cattle were standing in the shed;
10522,FINALE,"She loosed the strong white charger, that fed from out her hand,"
10523,FINALE,"She mounted, and she turned his head towards her native land."
10524,FINALE,
10525,FINALE,"Out--out into the darkness--faster, and still more fast;"
10526,FINALE,"The smooth grass flies behind her, the chestnut wood is past;"
10527,FINALE,She looks up; clouds are heavy: Why is her steed so slow?--
10528,FINALE,Scarcely the wind beside them can pass them as they go.
10529,FINALE,
10530,FINALE,"""Faster!"" she cries. ""Oh, faster!"" Eleven the church-bells chime;"
10531,FINALE,"""O God,"" she cries, ""help Bregenz, and bring me there in time!"""
10532,FINALE,"But louder than bells' ringing, or lowing of the kine,"
10533,FINALE,Grows nearer in the midnight the rushing of the Rhine.
10534,FINALE,
10535,FINALE,Shall not the roaring waters their headlong gallop check?
10536,FINALE,"The steed draws back in terror, she leans upon his neck"
10537,FINALE,"To watch the flowing darkness,--the bank is high and steep;"
10538,FINALE,"One pause--he staggers forward, and plunges in the deep."
10539,FINALE,
10540,FINALE,"She strives to pierce the blackness, and looser throws the rein;"
10541,FINALE,Her steed must breast the waters that dash above his mane.
10542,FINALE,"How gallantly, how nobly, he struggles through the foam,"
10543,FINALE,And see--in the far distance shine out the lights of home!
10544,FINALE,
10545,FINALE,"Up the steep bank he bears her, and now they rush again"
10546,FINALE,"Toward the heights of Bregenz, that tower above the plain."
10547,FINALE,"They reach the gate of Bregenz, just as the midnight rings,"
10548,FINALE,And out come serf and soldier to meet the news she brings.
10549,FINALE,
10550,FINALE,Bregenz is saved! Ere daylight her battlements are manned;
10551,FINALE,Defiance greets the army that marches on the land.
10552,FINALE,"And if to deeds heroic should endless fame be paid,"
10553,FINALE,Bregenz does well to honor the noble Tyrol maid.
10554,FINALE,
10555,FINALE,"Three hundred years are vanished, and yet upon the hill"
10556,FINALE,"An old stone gateway rises, to do her honor still."
10557,FINALE,"And there, when Bregenz women sit spinning in the shade,"
10558,FINALE,They see in quaint old carving the charger and the maid.
10559,FINALE,
10560,FINALE,"And when, to guard old Bregenz, by gateway, street, and tower,"
10561,FINALE,"The warder paces all night long, and calls each passing hour:"
10562,FINALE,"""Nine,"" ""ten,"" ""eleven,"" he cries aloud, and then (O crown of fame!)"
10563,FINALE,When midnight pauses in the skies he calls the maiden's name!

10683,FINALE,
10684,FINALE,"""_You_ marry; saucy Brier-Rose! The man, he is not found"
10685,FINALE,"To marry such a worthless wench, these seven leagues around."""
10686,FINALE,"But Brier-Rose, she laughed and she trilled a merry lay:"
10687,FINALE,"""Perhaps he'll come, my mother dear, from eight leagues away."""
10688,FINALE,
10689,FINALE,"The good-wife with a ""humph"" and a sigh forsook the battle,"
10690,FINALE,And flung her pots and pails about with much vindictive rattle;
10691,FINALE,"""O Lord, what sin did I commit in youthful days, and wild,"
10692,FINALE,"That thou hast punished me in age with such a wayward child?"""
10693,FINALE,
10694,FINALE,"Up stole the girl on tiptoe, so that none her step could hear,"
10695,FINALE,And laughing pressed an airy kiss behind the good-wife's ear.
10696,FINALE,"And she, as e'er relenting, sighed: ""Oh, Heaven only knows"
10697,FINALE,"Whatever will become of you, my naughty Brier-Rose!"""
10698,FINALE,
10699,FINALE,The sun was high and summer sounds were teeming in the air;
10700,FINALE,"The clank of scythes, the cricket's whir, and swelling woodnotes rare,"
10701,FINALE,From fields and copse and meadow; and through the open door
10702,FINALE,"Sweet, fragrant whiffs of new-mown hay the idle breezes bore."
10703,FINALE,
10704,FINALE,"Then Brier-Rose grew pensive, like a bird of thoughtful mien,"
10705,FINALE,Whose little life has problems among the branches green.
10706,FINALE,"She heard the river brawling where the tide was swift and strong,"
10707,FINALE,"She heard the summer singing its strange, alluring song."
10708,FINALE,
10709,FINALE,And out she skipped the meadows o'er and gazed into the sky;
10710,FINALE,"Her heart o'erbrimmed with gladness, she scarce herself knew why,"
10711,FINALE,"And to a merry tune she hummed, ""Oh, Heaven only knows"
10712,FINALE,"Whatever will become of the naughty Brier-Rose!"""
10713,FINALE,
10714,FINALE,"Whene'er a thrifty matron this idle maid espied,"
10715,FINALE,"She shook her head in warning, and scarce her wrath could hide;"
10716,FINALE,"For girls were made for housewives, for spinning-wheel and loom,"
10717,FINALE,And not to drink the sunshine and wild flower's sweet perfume.
10718,FINALE,
10719,FINALE,"And oft the maidens cried, when the Brier-Rose went by,"
10720,FINALE,"""You cannot knit a stocking, and you cannot make a pie."""
10721,FINALE,"But Brier-Rose, as was her wont, she cocked her curly head:"
10722,FINALE,"""But I can sing a pretty song,"" full merrily she said."
10723,FINALE,
10724,FINALE,"And oft the young lads shouted, when they saw the maid at play:"
10725,FINALE,"""Ho, good-for-nothing Brier-Rose, how do you do to-day?"""
10726,FINALE,Then she shook her tiny fist; to her cheeks the color flew:
10727,FINALE,"""However much you coax me, I'll _never_ dance with you."""
10728,FINALE,
10729,FINALE,*       *       *       *       *
10730,FINALE,
10731,FINALE,"Thus flew the years light winged over Brier-Rose's head,"
10732,FINALE,Till she was twenty summers old and yet remained unwed.
10733,FINALE,"And all the parish wondered: ""The Lord Almighty knows"
10734,FINALE,"Whatever will become of that naughty Brier-Rose!"""
10735,FINALE,
10736,FINALE,And while they wondered came the spring a-dancing o'er the hills;
10737,FINALE,"Her breath was warmer than of yore, and all the mountain rills,"
10738,FINALE,"With their tinkling and their rippling and their rushing, filled the air,"
10739,FINALE,And the misty sounds of water forth-welling everywhere.
10740,FINALE,
10741,FINALE,"And in the valley's depth, like a lusty beast of prey,"
10742,FINALE,The river leaped and roared aloud and tossed its mane of spray;
10743,FINALE,"Then hushed again its voice to a softly plashing croon,"
10744,FINALE,As dark it rolled beneath the sun and white beneath the moon.
10745,FINALE,
10746,FINALE,It was a merry sight to see the lumber as it whirled
10747,FINALE,"Adown the tawny eddies that hissed and seethed and swirled,"
10748,FINALE,"Now shooting through the rapids and, with a reeling swing,"
10749,FINALE,Into the foam-crests diving like an animated thing.
10750,FINALE,
10751,FINALE,"But in the narrows of the rocks, where o'er a steep incline"
10752,FINALE,"The waters plunged, and wreathed in foam the dark boughs of the pine,"
10753,FINALE,"The lads kept watch with shout and song, and sent each straggling beam"
10754,FINALE,"A-spinning down the rapids, lest it should lock the stream."
10755,FINALE,
10756,FINALE,*       *       *       *       *
10757,FINALE,
10758,FINALE,"And yet--methinks I hear it now--wild voices in the night,"
10759,FINALE,"A rush of feet, a dog's harsh bark, a torch's flaring light,"
10760,FINALE,"And wandering gusts of dampness, and round us far and nigh,"
10761,FINALE,A throbbing boom of water like a pulse-beat in the sky.
10762,FINALE,
10763,FINALE,The dawn just pierced the pallid east with spears of gold and red.
10764,FINALE,"As we, with boat-hooks in our hands, toward the narrows sped."
10765,FINALE,"And terror smote us; for we heard the mighty tree-tops sway,"
10766,FINALE,"And thunder, as of chariots, and hissing showers of spray."
10767,FINALE,
10768,FINALE,"""Now, lads,"" the sheriff shouted, ""you are strong, like Norway's rock:"
10769,FINALE,A hundred crowns I give to him who breaks the lumber lock!
10770,FINALE,"For if another hour go by, the angry waters' spoil"
10771,FINALE,"Our homes will be, and fields, and our weary years of toil."""
10772,FINALE,
10773,FINALE,We looked each at the other; each hoped his neighbor would
10774,FINALE,"Brave death and danger for his home, as valiant Norsemen should."
10775,FINALE,"But at our feet the brawling tide expanded like a lake,"
10776,FINALE,"And whirling beams came shooting on, and made the firm rock quake."
10777,FINALE,
10778,FINALE,"""Two hundred crowns!"" the sheriff cried, and breathless stood the crowd."
10779,FINALE,"""Two hundred crowns, my bonny lads!"" in anxious tones and loud."
10780,FINALE,"But not a man came forward, and no one spoke or stirred,"
10781,FINALE,And nothing save the thunder of the cataract was heard.
10782,FINALE,
10783,FINALE,"But as with trembling hands and with fainting hearts we stood,"
10784,FINALE,We spied a little curly head emerging from the wood.
10785,FINALE,"We heard a little snatch of a merry little song,"
10786,FINALE,And saw the dainty Brier-Rose come dancing through the throng.
10787,FINALE,
10788,FINALE,An angry murmur rose from the people round about.
10789,FINALE,"""Fling her into the river,"" we heard the matrons shout;"
10790,FINALE,"""Chase her away, the silly thing; for God himself scarce knows"
10791,FINALE,"Why ever he created that worthless Brier-Rose."""
10792,FINALE,
10793,FINALE,"Sweet Brier-Rose, she heard their cries; a little pensive smile"
10794,FINALE,Across her fair face flitted that might a stone beguile;
10795,FINALE,And then she gave her pretty head a roguish little cock:
10796,FINALE,"""Hand me a boat-hook, lads,"" she said; ""I think I'll break the lock."""
10797,FINALE,
10798,FINALE,Derisive shouts of laughter broke from throats of young and old:
10799,FINALE,"""Ho! good-for-nothing Brier-Rose, your tongue was ever bold."""
10800,FINALE,"And, mockingly, a boat-hook into her hands was flung,"
10801,FINALE,"When, lo! into the river's midst with daring leaps she sprung!"
10802,FINALE,
10803,FINALE,We saw her dimly through a mist of dense and blinding spray;
10804,FINALE,"From beam to beam she skipped, like a water-sprite at play."
10805,FINALE,And now and then faint gleams we caught of color through the mist:
10806,FINALE,"A crimson waist, a golden head, a little dainty wrist."
10807,FINALE,
10808,FINALE,"In terror pressed the people to the margin of the hill,"
10809,FINALE,"A hundred breaths were bated, a hundred hearts stood still."
10810,FINALE,"For, hark! from out the rapids came a strange and creaking sound,"
10811,FINALE,And then a crash of thunder which shook the very ground.
10812,FINALE,
10813,FINALE,The waters hurled the lumber mass down o'er the rocky steep.
10814,FINALE,We heard a muffled rumbling and a rolling in the deep;
10815,FINALE,We saw a tiny form which the torrent swiftly bore
10816,FINALE,"And flung into the wild abyss, where it was seen no more."
10817,FINALE,
10818,FINALE,"Ah, little naughty Brier-Rose, thou couldst not weave nor spin;"
10819,FINALE,Yet thou couldst do a nobler deed than all thy mocking kin;
10820,FINALE,"For thou hadst courage e'en to die, and by thy death to save"
10821,FINALE,A thousand farms and lives from the fury of the wave.
10822,FINALE,
10823,FINALE,"And yet the adage lives, in the valley of thy birth,"
10824,FINALE,"When wayward children spend their days in heedless play and mirth,"
10825,FINALE,"Oft mothers say, half smiling, half sighing, ""Heaven knows"
10826,FINALE,"Whatever will become of the naughty Brier-Rose!"""

10832,FINALE,
10833,FINALE,King Robert of Sicily
10834,FINALE,
10835,FINALE,
10836,FINALE,"Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane"
10837,FINALE,"And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
10838,FINALE,Appareled in magnificent attire
10839,FINALE,"With retinue of many a knight and squire,"
10840,FINALE,"On St. John's eve, at vespers, proudly sat"
10841,FINALE,And heard the priests chant the Magnificat.
10842,FINALE,"And as he listened, o'er and o'er again"
10843,FINALE,"Repeated, like a burden or refrain,"
10844,FINALE,"He caught the words, _""Deposuit potentes"
10845,FINALE,"De sede, et exaltavit humiles""_;"
10846,FINALE,"And slowly lifting up his kingly head,"
10847,FINALE,"He to a learned clerk beside him said,"
10848,FINALE,"""What mean those words?"" The clerk made answer meet,"
10849,FINALE,"""He has put down the mighty from their seat,"
10850,FINALE,"And has exalted them of low degree."""
10851,FINALE,"Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,"
10852,FINALE,"""'Tis well that such seditious words are sung"
10853,FINALE,"Only by priests, and in the Latin tongue;"
10854,FINALE,"For unto priests, and people be it known,"
10855,FINALE,"There is no power can push me from my throne,"""
10856,FINALE,"And leaning back he yawned and fell asleep,"
10857,FINALE,Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.
10858,FINALE,
10859,FINALE,"When he awoke, it was already night;"
10860,FINALE,"The church was empty, and there was no light,"
10861,FINALE,"Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,"
10862,FINALE,Lighted a little space before some saint.
10863,FINALE,"He started from his seat and gazed around,"
10864,FINALE,But saw no living thing and heard no sound.
10865,FINALE,"He groped towards the door, but it was locked;"
10866,FINALE,"He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,"
10867,FINALE,"And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,"
10868,FINALE,And imprecations upon men and saints.
10869,FINALE,The sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
10870,FINALE,As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls.
10871,FINALE,
10872,FINALE,"At length the sexton, hearing from without"
10873,FINALE,"The tumult of the knocking and the shout,"
10874,FINALE,"And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,"
10875,FINALE,"Came with his lantern, asking ""Who is there?"""
10876,FINALE,"Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,"
10877,FINALE,"""Open; 'tis I, the king! Art thou afraid?"""
10878,FINALE,"The frightened sexton, muttering with a curse,"
10879,FINALE,"""This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"""
10880,FINALE,Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;
10881,FINALE,"A man rushed by him at a single stride,"
10882,FINALE,"Haggard, half-naked, without hat or cloak,"
10883,FINALE,"Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,"
10884,FINALE,"But leaped into the blackness of the night,"
10885,FINALE,And vanished like a spectre from his sight.
10886,FINALE,
10887,FINALE,"Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane"
10888,FINALE,"And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
10889,FINALE,"Despoiled of his magnificent attire,"
10890,FINALE,"Bare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire,"
10891,FINALE,"With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,"
10892,FINALE,Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;
10893,FINALE,"Rushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage"
10894,FINALE,"To right and left each seneschal and page,"
10895,FINALE,"And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,"
10896,FINALE,His white face ghastly in the torches' glare.
10897,FINALE,From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;
10898,FINALE,"Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,"
10899,FINALE,"Until at last he reached the banquet-room,"
10900,FINALE,"Blazing with light, and breathing with perfume."
10901,FINALE,
10902,FINALE,"There on the dais sat another king,"
10903,FINALE,"Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet ring--"
10904,FINALE,"King Robert's self in features, form, and height,"
10905,FINALE,But all transfigured with angelic light!
10906,FINALE,It was an angel; and his presence there
10907,FINALE,"With a divine effulgence filled the air,"
10908,FINALE,"An exaltation, piercing the disguise,"
10909,FINALE,Though none the hidden angel recognize.
10910,FINALE,
10911,FINALE,"A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,"
10912,FINALE,"The throneless monarch on the angel gazed,"
10913,FINALE,Who met his look of anger and surprise
10914,FINALE,With the divine compassion of his eyes!
10915,FINALE,"Then said, ""Who art thou, and why com'st thou here?"""
10916,FINALE,"To which King Robert answered with a sneer,"
10917,FINALE,"""I am the king, and come to claim my own"
10918,FINALE,"From an impostor, who usurps my throne!"""
10919,FINALE,"And suddenly, at these audacious words,"
10920,FINALE,"Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;"
10921,FINALE,"The angel answered with unruffled brow,"
10922,FINALE,"""Nay, not the king, but the king's jester; thou"
10923,FINALE,Henceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape
10924,FINALE,And for thy counselor shalt lead an ape;
10925,FINALE,"Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,"
10926,FINALE,"And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!"""
10927,FINALE,
10928,FINALE,"Deaf to King Robert's threats and cries and prayers,"
10929,FINALE,They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;
10930,FINALE,"A group of tittering pages ran before,"
10931,FINALE,"And as they opened wide the folding door,"
10932,FINALE,"His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,"
10933,FINALE,"The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,"
10934,FINALE,And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
10935,FINALE,"With the mock plaudits of ""Long live the king!"""
10936,FINALE,
10937,FINALE,"Next morning, waking with the day's first beam,"
10938,FINALE,"He said within himself, ""It was a dream!"""
10939,FINALE,"But the straw rustled as he turned his head,"
10940,FINALE,There were the cap and bells beside his bed;
10941,FINALE,"Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,"
10942,FINALE,"Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,"
10943,FINALE,"And in the corner, a revolting shape,"
10944,FINALE,"Shivering and chattering, sat the wretched ape."
10945,FINALE,It was no dream; the world he loved so much
10946,FINALE,Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!
10947,FINALE,
10948,FINALE,Days came and went; and now returned again
10949,FINALE,To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;
10950,FINALE,Under the angel's governance benign
10951,FINALE,"The happy island danced with corn and wine,"
10952,FINALE,And deep within the mountain's burning breast
10953,FINALE,"Enceladus, the giant, was at rest."
10954,FINALE,
10955,FINALE,"Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,"
10956,FINALE,Sullen and silent and disconsolate.
10957,FINALE,"Dressed in the motley garb that jesters wear,"
10958,FINALE,"With look bewildered, and a vacant stare,"
10959,FINALE,"Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,"
10960,FINALE,"By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,"
10961,FINALE,"His only friend the ape, his only food"
10962,FINALE,What others left--he still was unsubdued.
10963,FINALE,"And when the angel met him on his way,"
10964,FINALE,"And half in earnest, half in jest, would say,"
10965,FINALE,"Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel"
10966,FINALE,"The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,"
10967,FINALE,"""Art thou the king?"" the passion of his woe"
10968,FINALE,Burst from him in resistless overflow.
10969,FINALE,"And lifting high his forehead, he would fling"
10970,FINALE,"The haughty answer back, ""I am, I am the king!"""
10971,FINALE,
10972,FINALE,"Almost three years were ended, when there came"
10973,FINALE,Ambassadors of great repute and name
10974,FINALE,"From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
10975,FINALE,"Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane"
10976,FINALE,By letter summoned them forthwith to come
10977,FINALE,On Holy Thursday to his City of Rome.
10978,FINALE,"The angel with great joy received his guests,"
10979,FINALE,"And gave them presents of embroidered vests,"
10980,FINALE,"And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,"
10981,FINALE,And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.
10982,FINALE,Then he departed with them o'er the sea
10983,FINALE,"Into the lovely land of Italy,"
10984,FINALE,Whose loveliness was more resplendent made
10985,FINALE,By the mere passing of that cavalcade
10986,FINALE,"With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir"
10987,FINALE,Of jeweled bridle and of golden spur.
10988,FINALE,
10989,FINALE,"And lo! among the menials, in mock state,"
10990,FINALE,"Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,"
10991,FINALE,"His cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind,"
10992,FINALE,"The solemn ape demurely perched behind,"
10993,FINALE,"King Robert rode, making huge merriment"
10994,FINALE,In all the country towns through which they went.
10995,FINALE,
10996,FINALE,"The Pope received them with great pomp, and blare"
10997,FINALE,"Of bannered trumpets, on St. Peter's Square,"
10998,FINALE,"Giving his benediction and embrace,"
10999,FINALE,"Fervent, and full of apostolic grace."
11000,FINALE,While with congratulations and with prayers
11001,FINALE,"He entertained the angel unawares,"
11002,FINALE,"Robert, the jester, bursting through the crowd,"
11003,FINALE,"Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud:"
11004,FINALE,"""I am the king! Look and behold in me"
11005,FINALE,"Robert, your brother, King of Sicily!"
11006,FINALE,"This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,"
11007,FINALE,Is an impostor in a king's disguise.
11008,FINALE,Do you not know me? Does no voice within
11009,FINALE,"Answer my cry, and say we are akin?"""
11010,FINALE,"The Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,"
11011,FINALE,Gazed at the angel's countenance serene;
11012,FINALE,"The Emperor, laughing, said, ""It is strange sport"
11013,FINALE,"To keep a mad man for thy fool at court!"""
11014,FINALE,"And the poor, baffled jester, in disgrace"
11015,FINALE,Was hustled back among the populace.
11016,FINALE,
11017,FINALE,"In solemn state the holy week went by,"
11018,FINALE,And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;
11019,FINALE,"The presence of the angel, with its light,"
11020,FINALE,"Before the sun rose, made the city bright,"
11021,FINALE,"And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,"
11022,FINALE,Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.
11023,FINALE,"Even the jester, on his bed of straw,"
11024,FINALE,With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw;
11025,FINALE,"He felt within a power unfelt before,"
11026,FINALE,"And kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,"
11027,FINALE,He heard the rustling garments of the Lord
11028,FINALE,"Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward."
11029,FINALE,
11030,FINALE,"And now the visit ending, and once more"
11031,FINALE,"Valmond returning to the Danube's shore,"
11032,FINALE,"Homeward the angel journeyed, and again"
11033,FINALE,"The land was made resplendent with his train,"
11034,FINALE,Flashing along the towns of Italy
11035,FINALE,"Unto Salerno, and from thence by sea."
11036,FINALE,"And when once more within Palermo's wall,"
11037,FINALE,"And, seated on the throne in his great hall,"
11038,FINALE,"He heard the Angelus from convent towers,"
11039,FINALE,"As if the better world conversed with ours,"
11040,FINALE,"He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,"
11041,FINALE,And with a gesture bade the rest retire.
11042,FINALE,"And when they were alone, the angel said,"
11043,FINALE,"""Art thou the king?"" Then, bowing down his head,"
11044,FINALE,"King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,"
11045,FINALE,"And meekly answered him, ""Thou knowest best!"
11046,FINALE,"My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,"

11051,FINALE,"The angel smiled, and from his radiant face"
11052,FINALE,"A holy light illumined all the place,"
11053,FINALE,"And through the open window, loud and clear,"
11054,FINALE,"They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,"
11055,FINALE,"Above the stir and tumult of the street,"
11056,FINALE,"""He has put down the mighty from their seat,"
11057,FINALE,"And has exalted them of low degree!"""
11058,FINALE,And through the chant a second melody
11059,FINALE,Rose like the throbbing of a single string:
11060,FINALE,"""I am an angel, and thou art the king!"""
11061,FINALE,
11062,FINALE,"King Robert, who was standing near the throne,"
11063,FINALE,"Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!"
11064,FINALE,"But all appareled as in days of old,"
11065,FINALE,With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;
11066,FINALE,"And when his courtiers came they found him there,"
11067,FINALE,"Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer."

11076,FINALE,
11077,FINALE,"It was late in mild October, and the long autumnal rain"
11078,FINALE,Had left the summer harvest-fields all green with grass again;
11079,FINALE,"The first sharp frosts had fallen, leaving all the woodlands gay"
11080,FINALE,"With the hues of summer's rainbow, or the meadow-flowers of May."
11081,FINALE,
11082,FINALE,"Through a thin, dry mist, that morning, the sun rose broad and red,"
11083,FINALE,"At first a rayless disk of fire, he brightened as he sped;"
11084,FINALE,"Yet, even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued,"
11085,FINALE,"On the cornfields and the orchards, and softly pictured wood."
11086,FINALE,
11087,FINALE,"And all that quiet afternoon, slow sloping to the night,"
11088,FINALE,He wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light;
11089,FINALE,"Slanting through the painted beeches, he glorified the hill;"
11090,FINALE,"And beneath it, pond and meadow lay brighter, greener still."
11091,FINALE,
11092,FINALE,"And shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky,"
11093,FINALE,"Flecked by the many-tinted leaves, and laughed, they knew not why;"
11094,FINALE,"And schoolgirls, gay with aster-flowers, beside the meadow brooks,"
11095,FINALE,Mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks.
11096,FINALE,
11097,FINALE,"From spire and ball looked westerly the patient weathercock,"
11098,FINALE,But even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks.
11099,FINALE,"No sound was in the woodlands, save the squirrel's dropping shell,"
11100,FINALE,"And the yellow leaves among the boughs, low rustling as they fell."
11101,FINALE,
11102,FINALE,"The summer grains were harvested; the stubble-fields lay dry,"
11103,FINALE,"Where June winds rolled, in light and shade, the pale green waves of rye;"
11104,FINALE,"But still, on gentle hill-slopes, in valleys fringed with wood,"
11105,FINALE,"Ungathered, bleaching in the sun, the heavy corn crop stood."
11106,FINALE,
11107,FINALE,"Bent low, by autumn's wind and rain, through husks that, dry and sere,"
11108,FINALE,"Unfolded by their ripened charge, shone out the yellow ear;"
11109,FINALE,"Beneath, the turnip lay concealed, in many a verdant fold,"
11110,FINALE,And glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin's sphere of gold.
11111,FINALE,
11112,FINALE,There wrought the busy harvesters; and many a creaking wain
11113,FINALE,Bore slowly to the long barn-floor its load of husk and grain;
11114,FINALE,"Till broad and red, as when he rose, the sun sank down, at last,"
11115,FINALE,"And like a merry guest's farewell, the day in brightness passed."
11116,FINALE,
11117,FINALE,"And lo! as through the western pines on meadow, stream, and pond,"
11118,FINALE,"Flamed the red radiance of a sky, set all afire beyond,"
11119,FINALE,"Slowly o'er the eastern sea-bluffs a milder glory shone,"
11120,FINALE,And the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one!
11121,FINALE,
11122,FINALE,"As thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away,"
11123,FINALE,And deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay;
11124,FINALE,"From many a brown old farm-house, and hamlet without name,"
11125,FINALE,"Their milking and their home-tasks done, the merry huskers came."
11126,FINALE,
11127,FINALE,"Swung o'er the heaped-up harvest, from pitchforks in the mow,"
11128,FINALE,Shone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below;
11129,FINALE,"The growing pile of husks behind, the golden ears before,"
11130,FINALE,And laughing eyes and busy hands and brown cheeks glimmering o'er.
11131,FINALE,
11132,FINALE,"Half hidden in a quiet nook, serene of look and heart,"
11133,FINALE,"Talking their old times over, the old men sat apart;"
11134,FINALE,"While, up and down the unhusked pile, or nestling in its shade,"
11135,FINALE,"At hide-and-seek, with laugh and shout, the happy children played."
11136,FINALE,
11137,FINALE,"Urged by the good host's daughter, a maiden young and fair,"
11138,FINALE,"Lifting to light her sweet blue eyes and pride of soft brown hair,"
11139,FINALE,"The master of the village school, sleek of hair and smooth of tongue,"
11140,FINALE,"To the quaint tune of some old psalm, a husking-ballad sung."

11152,FINALE,"Who, seeing the birds fly, didn't jump"

11154,FINALE,"Or, spreading the tail"
11155,FINALE,"Of his coat for a sail,"
11156,FINALE,"Take a soaring leap from post or rail,"
11157,FINALE,And wonder why
11158,FINALE,"He couldn't fly,"
11159,FINALE,And flap and flutter and wish and try--
11160,FINALE,If ever you knew a country dunce
11161,FINALE,"Who didn't try that as often as once,"
11162,FINALE,"All I can say is, that's a sign"
11163,FINALE,He never would do for a hero of mine.
11164,FINALE,
11165,FINALE,An aspiring genius was D. Green:
11166,FINALE,"The son of a farmer,--age fourteen;"
11167,FINALE,"His body was long and lank and lean,--"
11168,FINALE,"Just right for flying, as will be seen;"
11169,FINALE,"He had two eyes, each bright as a bean,"
11170,FINALE,"And a freckled nose that grew between,"
11171,FINALE,"A little awry,--for I must mention"
11172,FINALE,That he had riveted his attention
11173,FINALE,"Upon his wonderful invention,"
11174,FINALE,"Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings,"
11175,FINALE,"Working his face as he worked the wings,"
11176,FINALE,And with every turn of gimlet and screw
11177,FINALE,"Turning and screwing his mouth round, too,"
11178,FINALE,Till his nose seemed bent
11179,FINALE,"To catch the scent,"
11180,FINALE,"Around some corner, of new-baked pies,"
11181,FINALE,And his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes
11182,FINALE,"Grew puckered into a queer grimace,"
11183,FINALE,"That made him look very droll in the face,"
11184,FINALE,And also very wise.
11185,FINALE,
11186,FINALE,"And wise he must have been, to do more"
11187,FINALE,"Than ever a genius did before,"
11188,FINALE,Excepting Daedalus of yore
11189,FINALE,"And his son Icarus, who wore"
11190,FINALE,Upon their backs
11191,FINALE,Those wings of wax
11192,FINALE,He had read of in the old almanacs.
11193,FINALE,Darius was clearly of the opinion
11194,FINALE,"That the air is also man's dominion,"
11195,FINALE,"And that, with paddle or fin or pinion,"
11196,FINALE,We soon or late
11197,FINALE,Shall navigate
11198,FINALE,The azure as now we sail the sea.
11199,FINALE,The thing looks simple enough to me;
11200,FINALE,"And if you doubt it,"
11201,FINALE,Hear how Darius reasoned about it.
11202,FINALE,
11203,FINALE,"""Birds can fly,"
11204,FINALE,An' why can't I?
11205,FINALE,"Must we give in,"""
11206,FINALE,"Says he with a grin,"
11207,FINALE,"""'T the bluebird an' phoebe"
11208,FINALE,Are smarter'n we be?
11209,FINALE,"Jest fold our hands an' see the swaller,"
11210,FINALE,An' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler?
11211,FINALE,"Does the leetle, chatterin', sassy wren,"
11212,FINALE,"No bigger'n my thumb, know more than men?"
11213,FINALE,Jest show me that!
11214,FINALE,Er prove 't the bat
11215,FINALE,"Has got more brains than's in my hat,"
11216,FINALE,"An' I'll back down, an' not till then!"""
11217,FINALE,
11218,FINALE,"He argued further: ""Ner I can't see"
11219,FINALE,"What's ta' use o' wings to a bumblebee,"
11220,FINALE,"Fer to git a livin' with, more'n to me;--"
11221,FINALE,Ain't my business
11222,FINALE,Important's his'n is?
11223,FINALE,That Icarus
11224,FINALE,"Was a silly cuss,--"
11225,FINALE,Him an' his daddy Daedalus.
11226,FINALE,They might 'a' knowed wings made o' wax
11227,FINALE,Wouldn't stan' sun-heat an' hard whacks.
11228,FINALE,"I'll make mine o' luther,"
11229,FINALE,"Er suthin' er other."""
11230,FINALE,
11231,FINALE,"And he said to himself, as he tinkered and planned:"
11232,FINALE,"""But I ain't goin' to show my hand"
11233,FINALE,To mummies that never can understand
11234,FINALE,The fust idee that's big an' grand.
11235,FINALE,They'd 'a' laft an' made fun
11236,FINALE,"O' Creation itself afore't was done!"""
11237,FINALE,So he kept his secret from all the rest
11238,FINALE,Safely buttoned within his vest;
11239,FINALE,And in the loft above the shed
11240,FINALE,"Himself he locks, with thimble and thread"
11241,FINALE,"And wax and hammer and buckles and screws,"
11242,FINALE,And all such things as geniuses use;--
11243,FINALE,"Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!"
11244,FINALE,A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows;
11245,FINALE,"An old hoop-skirt or two, as well as"
11246,FINALE,Some wire and several old umbrellas;
11247,FINALE,"A carriage-cover, for tail and wings;"
11248,FINALE,A piece of harness; and straps and strings;
11249,FINALE,And a big strong boxs
11250,FINALE,In which he locks
11251,FINALE,These and a hundred other things.
11252,FINALE,
11253,FINALE,"His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke"
11254,FINALE,"And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk"
11255,FINALE,"Around the corner to see him work,--"
11256,FINALE,"Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk,"
11257,FINALE,"Drawing the waxed end through with a jerk,"
11258,FINALE,And boring the holes with a comical quirk
11259,FINALE,"Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk."
11260,FINALE,"But vainly they mounted each other's backs,"
11261,FINALE,And poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks;
11262,FINALE,With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks
11263,FINALE,He plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks;
11264,FINALE,"And a bucket of water, which one would think"
11265,FINALE,He had brought up into the loft to drink
11266,FINALE,"When he chanced to be dry,"
11267,FINALE,"Stood always nigh,"
11268,FINALE,For Darius was sly!
11269,FINALE,And whenever at work he happened to spy
11270,FINALE,"At chink or crevice a blinking eye,"
11271,FINALE,He let a dipper of water fly.
11272,FINALE,"""Take that! an' ef ever ye get a peep,"
11273,FINALE,"Guess ye'll ketch a weasel asleep!"""
11274,FINALE,And he sings as he locks
11275,FINALE,His big strong box:--
11276,FINALE,
11277,FINALE,"""The weasel's head is small an' trim,"
11278,FINALE,"An' he is leetle an' long an' slim,"
11279,FINALE,"An' quick of motion an' nimble of limb,"
11280,FINALE,An' ef yeou'll be
11281,FINALE,Advised by me
11282,FINALE,"Keep wide awake when ye're ketchin' him!"""
11283,FINALE,So day after day
11284,FINALE,"He stitched and tinkered and hammered away,"
11285,FINALE,"Till at last 'twas done,--"
11286,FINALE,The greatest invention under the sun!
11287,FINALE,"""An' now,"" says Darius, ""hooray fer some fun!"""
11288,FINALE,
11289,FINALE,"'Twas the Fourth of July,"
11290,FINALE,"And the weather was dry,"
11291,FINALE,"And not a cloud was on all the sky,"
11292,FINALE,"Save a few light fleeces, which here and there,"
11293,FINALE,"Half mist, half air,"
11294,FINALE,Like foam on the ocean went floating by:
11295,FINALE,Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen
11296,FINALE,For a nice little trip in a flying-machine.
11297,FINALE,
11298,FINALE,"Thought cunning Darius: ""Now I sha'n't go"
11299,FINALE,Along 'ith the fellers to see the show.
11300,FINALE,I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough!
11301,FINALE,"An' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off"
11302,FINALE,I'll hev full swing
11303,FINALE,"For to try the thing,"
11304,FINALE,"An' practyse a leetle on the wing."""
11305,FINALE,"""Ain't goin' to see the celebration?"""
11306,FINALE,"Says Brother Nate. ""No; botheration!"
11307,FINALE,I've got sich a cold--a toothache--I--
11308,FINALE,"My gracious!--feel's though I should fly!"""
11309,FINALE,
11310,FINALE,"Said Jotham, ""Sho!"
11311,FINALE,"Guess ye better go."""
11312,FINALE,"But Darius said, ""No!"
11313,FINALE,"Shouldn't wonder 'f yeou might see me, though,"
11314,FINALE,"'Long 'bout noon, ef I git red"
11315,FINALE,"O' this jumpin', thumpin' pain 'n my head."""
11316,FINALE,For all the while to himself he said:--
11317,FINALE,"""I'll tell ye what!"
11318,FINALE,"I'll fly a few times around the lot,"
11319,FINALE,"To see how 't seems, then soon's I've got"
11320,FINALE,"The hang o' the thing, ez likely's not,"
11321,FINALE,"I'll astonish the nation,"
11322,FINALE,"And all creation,"
11323,FINALE,By flyin' over the celebration!
11324,FINALE,Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle;
11325,FINALE,I'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull;
11326,FINALE,I'll dance on the chimbleys; I'll stan' on the steeple;
11327,FINALE,I'll flop up to winders an' scare the people!
11328,FINALE,"I'll light on the libbe'ty-pole, an' crow;"
11329,FINALE,"An' I'll say to the gawpin' fools below,"
11330,FINALE,'What world's this 'ere
11331,FINALE,That I've come near?'
11332,FINALE,Fer I'll make 'em believe I'm a chap f'm the moon!
11333,FINALE,"An' I'll try a race 'ith their ol' bulloon."""
11334,FINALE,He crept from his bed;
11335,FINALE,"And, seeing the others were gone, he said,"
11336,FINALE,"I'm a-gittin' over the cold 'n my head."""
11337,FINALE,"And away he sped,"
11338,FINALE,To open the wonderful box in the shed.
11339,FINALE,
11340,FINALE,His brothers had walked but a little way
11341,FINALE,"When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,"
11342,FINALE,"""What on airth is he up to, hey?"""
11343,FINALE,"""Don'o,--the' 's suthin' er other to pay,"
11344,FINALE,"Er he wouldn't 'a' stayed to hum to-day."""
11345,FINALE,"Says Burke, ""His toothache's all 'n his eye!"
11346,FINALE,"_He_ never'd miss a Fo'th-o'-July,"
11347,FINALE,Ef he hedn't some machine to try.
11348,FINALE,"Le's hurry back and hide in the barn,"
11349,FINALE,"An' pay him fer tellin' us that yarn!"""
11350,FINALE,"""Agreed!"" Through the orchard they creep back,"
11351,FINALE,"Along by the fences, behind the stack,"
11352,FINALE,"And one by one, through a hole in the wall,"
11353,FINALE,"In under the dusty barn they crawl,"
11354,FINALE,Dressed in their Sunday garments all;
11355,FINALE,"And a very astonishing sight was that,"
11356,FINALE,When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat
11357,FINALE,Came up through the floor like an ancient rat.
11358,FINALE,And there they hid;
11359,FINALE,And Reuben slid
11360,FINALE,"The fastenings back, and the door undid."
11361,FINALE,"""Keep dark!"" said he,"
11362,FINALE,"""While I squint an' see what the' is to see."""
11363,FINALE,
11364,FINALE,"As knights of old put on their mail,--"
11365,FINALE,From head to foot
11366,FINALE,"An iron suit,"
11367,FINALE,"Iron jacket and iron boot,"
11368,FINALE,"Iron breeches, and on the head"
11369,FINALE,"No hat, but an iron pot instead,"
11370,FINALE,"And under the chin the bail,--"
11371,FINALE,I believe they called the thing a helm;
11372,FINALE,And the lid they carried they called a shield;
11373,FINALE,"And, thus accoutred, they took the field,"
11374,FINALE,Sallying forth to overwhelm
11375,FINALE,The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm:--
11376,FINALE,So this modern knight
11377,FINALE,"Prepared for flight,"
11378,FINALE,Put on his wings and strapped them tight;
11379,FINALE,"Jointed and jaunty, strong and light;"
11380,FINALE,"Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip,--"
11381,FINALE,Ten feet they measured from tip to tip!
11382,FINALE,"And a helm had he, but that he wore,"
11383,FINALE,"Not on his head like those of yore,"
11384,FINALE,But more like the helm of a ship.
11385,FINALE,
11386,FINALE,"""Hush!"" Reuben said,"
11387,FINALE,"""He's up in the shed!"
11388,FINALE,"He's opened the winder,--I see his head!"
11389,FINALE,"He stretches it out,"
11390,FINALE,"An' pokes it about,"
11391,FINALE,"Lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear,"
11392,FINALE,An' nobody near;--
11393,FINALE,Guess he don'o' who's hid in here!
11394,FINALE,He's riggin' a spring-board over the sill!
11395,FINALE,"Stop laffin', Solomon! Burke, keep still!"
11396,FINALE,He's a climbin' out now--of all the things!
11397,FINALE,"What's he got on? I van, it's wings!"
11398,FINALE,"An' that t'other thing? I vum, it's a tail!"
11399,FINALE,An' there he sets like a hawk on a rail!
11400,FINALE,"Steppin' careful, he travels the length"
11401,FINALE,"Of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength."
11402,FINALE,"Now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat;"
11403,FINALE,"Peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that,"
11404,FINALE,Fer to see 'f the' 's anyone passin' by;
11405,FINALE,But the' 's on'y a ca'f an' a goslin' nigh.
11406,FINALE,"_They_ turn up at him a wonderin' eye,"
11407,FINALE,To see--The dragon! he's goin' to fly!
11408,FINALE,Away he goes! Jimmmy! what a jump!
11409,FINALE,Flop-flop-an' plump
11410,FINALE,To the ground with a thump!
11411,FINALE,"Flutt'rin an' flound'rin', all in a lump!"""
11412,FINALE,
11413,FINALE,"As a demon is hurled by an angel's spear,"
11414,FINALE,"Heels over head, to his proper sphere,--"
11415,FINALE,"Heels over head, and head over heels,"
11416,FINALE,"Dizzily down the abyss he wheels,--"
11417,FINALE,"So fell Darius. Upon his crown,"
11418,FINALE,"In the midst of the barnyard, he came down,"
11419,FINALE,"In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,"
11420,FINALE,"Broken braces and broken springs,"
11421,FINALE,"Broken tail and broken wings,"
11422,FINALE,"Shooting-stars, and various things!"
11423,FINALE,"Away with a bellow fled the calf,"
11424,FINALE,And what was that? Did the gosling laugh?
11425,FINALE,'Tis a merry roar
11426,FINALE,"From the old barn-door,"
11427,FINALE,"And he hears the voice of Jotham crying,"

11429,FINALE,"Slowly, ruefully, where he lay,"

11881,MORAL,
11882,MORAL,"I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,"
11883,MORAL,Among my skimming swallows;
11884,MORAL,I make the netted sunbeam dance
11885,MORAL,Against my sandy shallows.
11886,MORAL,
11887,MORAL,"I murmur under moon and stars,"
11888,MORAL,In brambly wildernesses;
11889,MORAL,I linger by my shingly bars;
11890,MORAL,I loiter round my cresses;
11891,MORAL,
11892,MORAL,And out again I curve and flow
11893,MORAL,"To join the brimming river,"

11908,MORAL,June may be had by the poorest comer.
11909,MORAL,
11910,MORAL,And what is so rare as a day in June?
11911,MORAL,"Then, if ever, come perfect days;"
11912,MORAL,"Then Heaven tries earth if it be in tune,"
11913,MORAL,And over it softly her warm ear lays;
11914,MORAL,"Whether we look, or whether we listen,"
11915,MORAL,"We hear life murmur, or see it glisten;"
11916,MORAL,"Every clod feels a stir of might,"
11917,MORAL,"An instinct within it that reaches and towers,"
11918,MORAL,"And, groping blindly above it for light,"
11919,MORAL,Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;
11920,MORAL,The flush of life may well be seen
11921,MORAL,Thrilling back over hills and valleys;
11922,MORAL,"The cowslip startles in meadows green,"
11923,MORAL,"The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,"
11924,MORAL,And there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean
11925,MORAL,To be some happy creature's palace;
11926,MORAL,"The little bird sits at his door in the sun,"
11927,MORAL,"Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,"
11928,MORAL,And lets his illumined being o'errun
11929,MORAL,With the deluge of summer it receives;
11930,MORAL,"His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,"
11931,MORAL,And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings;
11932,MORAL,"He sings to the wide world, and she to her nest,--"
11933,MORAL,"In the nice ear of Nature, which song is the best?"
11934,MORAL,
11935,MORAL,"Now is the high-tide of the year,"
11936,MORAL,And whatever of life hath ebbed away
11937,MORAL,"Comes flooding back, with a ripply cheer,"
11938,MORAL,Into every bare inlet and creek and bay;
11939,MORAL,"Now the heart is so full that a drop overfills it,"
11940,MORAL,We are happy now because God wills it;
11941,MORAL,"No matter how barren the past may have been,"
11942,MORAL,'T is enough for us now that the leaves are green;
11943,MORAL,We sit in the warm shade and feel right well
11944,MORAL,How the sap creeps up and the blossoms swell;
11945,MORAL,"We may shut our eyes, but we cannot help knowing"
11946,MORAL,That skies are clear and grass is growing;
11947,MORAL,"The breeze comes whispering in our ear,"
11948,MORAL,"That dandelions are blossoming near,"
11949,MORAL,"That maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing,"
11950,MORAL,"That the river is bluer than the sky,"
11951,MORAL,That the robin is plastering his house hard by;
11952,MORAL,"And if the breeze kept the good news back,"
11953,MORAL,For other couriers we should not lack;
11954,MORAL,"We could guess it all by yon heifer's lowing,--"
11955,MORAL,"And hark! how clear bold chanticleer,"
11956,MORAL,"Warmed with the new wine of the year,"
11957,MORAL,Tells all in his lusty crowing!
11958,MORAL,
11959,MORAL,"Joy comes, grief goes, we know not how;"
11960,MORAL,"Everything is happy now,"
11961,MORAL,Everything is upward striving;
11962,MORAL,'T is as easy now for the heart to be true
11963,MORAL,"As for grass to be green or skies to be blue,--"
11964,MORAL,'T is the natural way of living.
11965,MORAL,Who knows whither the clouds have fled?
11966,MORAL,"In the unscarred heaven they leave no wake,"
11967,MORAL,"And the eyes forget the tears they have shed,"
11968,MORAL,The heart forgets its sorrow and ache;
11969,MORAL,"The soul partakes the season's youth,"
11970,MORAL,And the sulphurous rifts of passion and woe
11971,MORAL,"Lie deep 'neath a silence pure and smooth,"
11972,MORAL,Like burnt-out craters healed with snow.

11980,MORAL,
11981,MORAL,
11982,MORAL,"Come, let us plant the apple-tree."
11983,MORAL,Cleave the tough greensward with the spade;
11984,MORAL,Wide let its hollow bed be made;
11985,MORAL,"There gently lay the roots, and there"
11986,MORAL,Sift the dark mould with kindly care.
11987,MORAL,"And press it o'er them tenderly,"
11988,MORAL,As round the sleeping infant's feet
11989,MORAL,We softly fold the cradle-sheet;
11990,MORAL,So plant we the apple tree.
11991,MORAL,
11992,MORAL,What plant we in this apple-tree?
11993,MORAL,"Buds, which the breath of summer days"
11994,MORAL,Shall lengthen into leafy sprays;
11995,MORAL,Boughs where the thrush with crimson breast
11996,MORAL,"Shall haunt, and sing, and hide her nest;"
11997,MORAL,"We plant, upon the sunny lea,"
11998,MORAL,"A shadow for the noontide hour,"
11999,MORAL,"A shelter from the summer shower,"
12000,MORAL,When we plant the apple-tree.
12001,MORAL,
12002,MORAL,What plant we in this apple-tree?
12003,MORAL,"Sweets for a hundred flowery springs,"
12004,MORAL,"To load the May-wind's restless wings,"
12005,MORAL,"When, from the orchard row, he pours"
12006,MORAL,Its fragrance through our open doors;
12007,MORAL,"A world of blossoms for the bee,"
12008,MORAL,"Flowers for the sick girl's silent room,"
12009,MORAL,"For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,"
12010,MORAL,We plant with the apple-tree.
12011,MORAL,
12012,MORAL,What plant we in this apple-tree?
12013,MORAL,"Fruits that shall swell in sunny June,"
12014,MORAL,"And redden in the August noon,"
12015,MORAL,"And drop, when gentle airs come by,"
12016,MORAL,That fan the blue September sky.
12017,MORAL,"While children come, with cries of glee,"
12018,MORAL,And seek them where the fragrant grass
12019,MORAL,"Betrays their bed to those who pass,"
12020,MORAL,At the foot of the apple tree.
12021,MORAL,
12022,MORAL,"And when, above this apple tree,"
12023,MORAL,"The winter stars are quivering bright,"
12024,MORAL,"And winds go howling through the night,"
12025,MORAL,"Girls, whose young eyes o'erflow with mirth,"
12026,MORAL,"Shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth,"
12027,MORAL,"And guests in prouder homes shall see,"
12028,MORAL,"Heaped with the grape of Cintra's vine,"
12029,MORAL,"And golden orange of the Line,"
12030,MORAL,The fruit of the apple-tree.
12031,MORAL,
12032,MORAL,The fruitage of this apple-tree
12033,MORAL,"Winds, and our flag of stripe and star"
12034,MORAL,"Shall bear to coasts that lie afar,"
12035,MORAL,"Where men shall wonder at the view,"
12036,MORAL,And ask in what fair groves they grew;
12037,MORAL,And sojourners beyond the sea
12038,MORAL,Shall think of childhood's careless day
12039,MORAL,"And long, long hours of summer play,"
12040,MORAL,In the shade of the apple-tree.
12041,MORAL,
12042,MORAL,Each year shall give this apple-tree
12043,MORAL,"A broader flush of roseate bloom,"
12044,MORAL,"A deeper maze of verdurous gloom,"
12045,MORAL,"And loosen, when the frost-clouds lower,"
12046,MORAL,The crisp brown leaves in thicker shower.
12047,MORAL,"The years shall come and pass, but we"
12048,MORAL,"Shall hear no longer, where we lie,"
12049,MORAL,"The summer's songs, the autumn's sigh,"
12050,MORAL,In the boughs of the apple-tree.
12051,MORAL,
12052,MORAL,And time shall waste this apple tree.
12053,MORAL,"Oh, when its aged branches throw"
12054,MORAL,"Thin shadows on the ground below,"
12055,MORAL,Shall fraud and force and iron will
12056,MORAL,Oppress the weak and helpless still?
12057,MORAL,"What shall the tasks of mercy be,"
12058,MORAL,"Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears"
12059,MORAL,Of those who live when length of years
12060,MORAL,Is wasting this apple-tree?
12061,MORAL,
12062,MORAL,"""Who planted this old apple-tree?"""
12063,MORAL,The children of that distant day
12064,MORAL,Thus to some aged man shall say;

12081,MORAL,That every man in arms should wish to be?
12082,MORAL,"--It is the generous Spirit, who, when brought"
12083,MORAL,"Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought"
12084,MORAL,Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:
12085,MORAL,Whose high endeavors are an inward light
12086,MORAL,That makes the path before him always bright:
12087,MORAL,"Who, with a natural instinct to discern"
12088,MORAL,"What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;"
12089,MORAL,"Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,"
12090,MORAL,But makes his moral being his prime care;
12091,MORAL,"Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,"
12092,MORAL,"And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!"
12093,MORAL,Turns his necessity to glorious gain;
12094,MORAL,In face of these doth exercise a power
12095,MORAL,Which is our human nature's highest dower;
12096,MORAL,"Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves"
12097,MORAL,"Of their bad influence, and their good receives:"
12098,MORAL,"By objects, which might force the soul to abate"
12099,MORAL,"Her feeling, rendered more compassionate;"
12100,MORAL,Is placable--because occasions rise
12101,MORAL,So often that demand such sacrifice;
12102,MORAL,"More skillful in self-knowledge, even more pure,"
12103,MORAL,"As tempted more; more able to endure,"
12104,MORAL,As more exposed to suffering and distress;
12105,MORAL,"Thence also, more alive to tenderness."
12106,MORAL,--'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends
12107,MORAL,Upon that law as on the best of friends;
12108,MORAL,"Whence, in a state where men are tempted still"
12109,MORAL,"To evil for a guard against worse ill,"
12110,MORAL,And what in quality or act is best
12111,MORAL,"Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,"
12112,MORAL,"He labors good on good to fix, and owes"
12113,MORAL,To virtue every triumph that he knows:
12114,MORAL,"--Who, if he rise to station of command,"
12115,MORAL,Rises by open means; and there will stand
12116,MORAL,"On honorable terms, or else retire,"
12117,MORAL,And in himself possess his own desire;
12118,MORAL,"Who comprehends his trust, and to the same"
12119,MORAL,Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;
12120,MORAL,"And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait"
12121,MORAL,"For wealth, or honors, or for worldly state;"
12122,MORAL,"Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,"
12123,MORAL,"Like showers of manna, if they come at all;"
12124,MORAL,"Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,"
12125,MORAL,"Or mild concerns of ordinary life,"
12126,MORAL,"A constant influence, a peculiar grace;"
12127,MORAL,"But who, if he be called upon to face"
12128,MORAL,Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined
12129,MORAL,"Great issues, good or bad for human kind,"
12130,MORAL,Is happy as a Lover; and attired
12131,MORAL,"With sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;"
12132,MORAL,"And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law"
12133,MORAL,"In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;"
12134,MORAL,"Or if an unexpected call succeed,"
12135,MORAL,"Come when it will, is equal to the need:"
12136,MORAL,"--He who, though thus endued as with a sense"
12137,MORAL,"And faculty for storm and turbulence,"
12138,MORAL,Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans
12139,MORAL,To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;
12140,MORAL,"Sweet images! which, wheresoe'er he be,"
12141,MORAL,Are at his heart; and such fidelity
12142,MORAL,It is his darling passion to approve;
12143,MORAL,"More brave for this, that he hath much to love:--"
12144,MORAL,"'Tis, finally, the Man who lifted high,"
12145,MORAL,"Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,"
12146,MORAL,"Or left unthought-of in obscurity,--"
12147,MORAL,"Who, with a toward or untoward lot,"
12148,MORAL,"Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--"
12149,MORAL,"Plays, in the many games of life, that one"
12150,MORAL,Where what he most doth value must be won:
12151,MORAL,"Whom neither shape of danger can dismay,"
12152,MORAL,Nor thought of tender happiness betray;
12153,MORAL,"Who, not content that former worth stand fast,"
12154,MORAL,"Looks forward, persevering to the last,"
12155,MORAL,"From well to better, daily self-surpast:"
12156,MORAL,"Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth"
12157,MORAL,"Forever, and to noble deeds give birth,"
12158,MORAL,"Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,"
12159,MORAL,And leave a dead unprofitable name--
12160,MORAL,Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;
12161,MORAL,"And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws"

12249,MORAL,"The terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar,"

12252,MORAL,
12253,MORAL,And wider still those billows of war
12254,MORAL,Thundered along the horizon's bar;
12255,MORAL,And louder yet into Winchester rolled
12256,MORAL,"The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,"
12257,MORAL,Making the blood of the listener cold
12258,MORAL,"As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,"
12259,MORAL,And Sheridan--twenty miles away.
12260,MORAL,
12261,MORAL,"But there is a road from Winchester town,"
12262,MORAL,A good broad highway leading down;
12263,MORAL,"And there, through the flush of the morning light,"
12264,MORAL,"A steed, as black as the steeds of night,"
12265,MORAL,"Was seen to pass, as with eagle flight;"
12266,MORAL,"As if he knew the terrible need,"
12267,MORAL,He stretched away with the utmost speed;
12268,MORAL,"Hills rose and fell--but his heart was gay,"
12269,MORAL,With Sheridan fifteen miles away.
12270,MORAL,
12271,MORAL,"Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering South,"
12272,MORAL,"The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth;"
12273,MORAL,"Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster,"
12274,MORAL,Foreboding to foemen the doom of disaster.
12275,MORAL,The heart of the steed and the heart of the master
12276,MORAL,"Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,"
12277,MORAL,Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;
12278,MORAL,"Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,"
12279,MORAL,With Sheridan only ten miles away.
12280,MORAL,
12281,MORAL,Under his spurning feet the road
12282,MORAL,"Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed,"

12284,MORAL,Like an ocean flying before the wind;

12287,MORAL,But lo! he is nearing his heart's desire--
12288,MORAL,"He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,"
12289,MORAL,With Sheridan only five miles away.
12290,MORAL,
12291,MORAL,The first that the General saw were the groups
12292,MORAL,"Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops."

13223,MORAL,Very gently will play;

13304,MORAL,A poet could not but be gay
13305,MORAL,In such a jocund company;

14125,MORAL,But our sluices keep you safe!
14126,MORAL,
14127,MORAL,But hark! Through the noise of waters
14128,MORAL,"Comes a low, clear, trickling sound;"
14129,MORAL,"And the child's face pales with terror,"
14130,MORAL,"And his blossoms drop to the ground,"
14131,MORAL,"He is up the bank in a moment,"
14132,MORAL,"And, stealing through the sand,"
14133,MORAL,He sees a stream not yet so large
14134,MORAL,"As his slender, childish hand."
14135,MORAL,"'Tis a leak in the dike! He is but a boy,"
14136,MORAL,Unused to fearful scenes;
14137,MORAL,"But, young as he is, he has learned to know"
14138,MORAL,The dreadful thing that means.
14139,MORAL,A leak in the dike! The stoutest heart
14140,MORAL,"Grows faint that cry to hear,"
14141,MORAL,And the bravest man in all the land
14142,MORAL,Turns white with mortal fear;
14143,MORAL,For he knows the smallest leak may grow
14144,MORAL,To a flood in a single night;
14145,MORAL,And he knows the strength of the cruel sea
14146,MORAL,When loosed in its angry might.
14147,MORAL,
14148,MORAL,And the boy! He has seen the danger
14149,MORAL,"And shouting a wild alarm,"
14150,MORAL,He forces back the weight of the sea
14151,MORAL,With the strength of his single arm!
14152,MORAL,He listens for the joyful sound
14153,MORAL,Of a footstep passing nigh;
14154,MORAL,"And lays his ear to the ground, to catch"
14155,MORAL,The answer to his cry.
14156,MORAL,"And he hears the rough winds blowing,"
14157,MORAL,"And the waters rise and fall,"
14158,MORAL,But never an answer comes to him
14159,MORAL,Save the echo of his call.
14160,MORAL,
14161,MORAL,"He sees no hope, no succor,"
14162,MORAL,His feeble voice is lost;
14163,MORAL,"Yet what shall he do but watch and wait,"
14164,MORAL,Though he perish at his post!
14165,MORAL,"So, faintly calling and crying"
14166,MORAL,Till the sun is under the sea;
14167,MORAL,Crying and moaning till the stars
14168,MORAL,Come out for company;
14169,MORAL,"He thinks of his brother and sister,"
14170,MORAL,Asleep in their safe warm bed;
14171,MORAL,"He thinks of his father and mother,"
14172,MORAL,Of himself as dying--and dead;
14173,MORAL,"And of how, when the night is over,"
14174,MORAL,They must come and find him at last;
14175,MORAL,But he never thinks he can leave the place
14176,MORAL,Where duty holds him fast.
14177,MORAL,
14178,MORAL,The good dame in the cottage
14179,MORAL,"Is up and astir with the light,"
14180,MORAL,For the thought of her little Peter
14181,MORAL,Has been with her all night.
14182,MORAL,"And now she watches the pathway,"
14183,MORAL,As yester eve she had done;
14184,MORAL,But what does she see so strange and black
14185,MORAL,Against the rising sun?
14186,MORAL,Her neighbors are bearing between them
14187,MORAL,Something straight to her door;
14188,MORAL,"Her child is coming home, but not"
14189,MORAL,As he ever came before!
14190,MORAL,
14191,MORAL,"""He is dead!"" she cries, ""my darling!"""
14192,MORAL,And the startled father hears.
14193,MORAL,"And comes and looks the way she looks,"
14194,MORAL,And fears the thing she fears;
14195,MORAL,Till a glad shout from the bearers
14196,MORAL,Thrills the stricken man and wife--
14197,MORAL,"""Give thanks, for your son, has saved our land,"
14198,MORAL,"And God has saved his life!"""
14199,MORAL,"So, there in the morning sunshine"
14200,MORAL,They knelt about the boy;
14201,MORAL,And every head was bared and bent
14202,MORAL,"In tearful, reverent joy."
14203,MORAL,
14204,MORAL,"'Tis many a year since then, but still,"
14205,MORAL,"When the sea roars like a flood,"
14206,MORAL,Their boys are taught what a boy can do
14207,MORAL,Who is brave and true and good;
14208,MORAL,For every man in that country
14209,MORAL,"Takes his son by the hand,"
14210,MORAL,And tells him of little Peter
14211,MORAL,Whose courage saved the land.
14212,MORAL,They have many a valiant hero
14213,MORAL,Remembered through the years;
14214,MORAL,But never one whose name so oft
14215,MORAL,Is named with loving tears;
14216,MORAL,"And his deed shall be sung by the cradle,"
14217,MORAL,"And told to the child on the knee,"

14219,MORAL,Divide the land from the sea!

14249,MORAL,"Robert of Lincoln's Quaker wife,"
14250,MORAL,"Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,"
14251,MORAL,"Passing at home a patient life,"
14252,MORAL,Broods in the grass while her husband sings:

14255,MORAL,"Brood, kind creature; you need not fear"

14257,MORAL,"Chee, chee, chee."
14258,MORAL,
14259,MORAL,Modest and shy as a nun is she;
14260,MORAL,One weak chirp is her only note.
14261,MORAL,"Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,"
14262,MORAL,Pouring boasts from his little throat:
14263,MORAL,"Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,"
14264,MORAL,"Spink, spank, spink;"
14265,MORAL,Never was I afraid of man;
14266,MORAL,"Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can."
14267,MORAL,"Chee, chee, chee."
14268,MORAL,
14269,MORAL,"Six white eggs on a bed of hay,"

14275,MORAL,"Nice, good wife, that never goes out,"

14277,MORAL,"Chee, chee, chee."
14278,MORAL,
14279,MORAL,Soon as the little ones chip the shell
14280,MORAL,Six wide mouths are open for food;

14282,MORAL,Gathering seeds for the hungry brood.

14356,MORAL,O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
14357,MORAL,
14358,MORAL,"We buried him darkly at dead of night,"
14359,MORAL,The sods with our bayonets turning;
14360,MORAL,"By struggling moonbeam's misty light,"
14361,MORAL,And the lantern dimly burning.
14362,MORAL,
14363,MORAL,"No useless coffin enclosed his breast,"
14364,MORAL,Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him;
14365,MORAL,"But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,"
14366,MORAL,With his martial cloak around him.
14367,MORAL,
14368,MORAL,"Few and short were the prayers we said,"
14369,MORAL,And we spoke not a word of sorrow;
14370,MORAL,"But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead,"

14372,MORAL,
14373,MORAL,"We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,"
14374,MORAL,"And smoothed down his lonely pillow,"
14375,MORAL,That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head;

14377,MORAL,
14378,MORAL,"Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone,"

14382,MORAL,
14383,MORAL,"But half of our heavy task was done,"
14384,MORAL,When the clock tolled the hour for retiring;

14386,MORAL,That the foe was sullenly firing.
14387,MORAL,
14388,MORAL,Slowly and sadly we laid him down.
14389,MORAL,From the field of his fame fresh and gory;

14569,MORAL,"And I on the opposite shore will be,"
14570,MORAL,Ready to ride and spread the alarm
14571,MORAL,"Through every Middlesex village and farm,"
14572,MORAL,"For the country folk to be up and to arm."""
14573,MORAL,
14574,MORAL,"Then he said, ""Good-night""; and with muffled oar"
14575,MORAL,"Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,"
14576,MORAL,"Just as the moon rose over the bay,"
14577,MORAL,"Where, swinging wide at her moorings, lay"
14578,MORAL,"The Somerset, British man-of-war,"
14579,MORAL,"A phantom ship, with each mast and spar"
14580,MORAL,"Across the moon like a prison bar,"
14581,MORAL,"And a huge black hulk, that was magnified"
14582,MORAL,By its own reflection in the tide.
14583,MORAL,
14584,MORAL,"Meanwhile, his friend through alley and street"
14585,MORAL,"Wanders and watches with eager ears,"
14586,MORAL,"Till, in the silence around him, he hears"
14587,MORAL,"The muster of men at the barrack door,"
14588,MORAL,"The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,"
14589,MORAL,And the measured tread of the grenadiers
14590,MORAL,Marching down to their boats on the shore.
14591,MORAL,
14592,MORAL,"Then he climbed to the tower of the old North Church,"
14593,MORAL,"By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,"
14594,MORAL,"To the belfry chamber overhead,"
14595,MORAL,And startled the pigeons from their perch
14596,MORAL,"On the sombre rafters, that round him made"
14597,MORAL,Masses and moving shapes of shade;
14598,MORAL,"By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,"
14599,MORAL,"To the highest window in the wall,"
14600,MORAL,"Where he paused to listen, and look down"
14601,MORAL,"A moment on the roofs of the town,"
14602,MORAL,And the moonlight flowing over all.
14603,MORAL,
14604,MORAL,"Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead"
14605,MORAL,"In their night encampment on the hill,"
14606,MORAL,Wrapped in silence so deep and still
14607,MORAL,"That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,"
14608,MORAL,"The watchful night wind, as it went,"
14609,MORAL,"Creeping along from tent to tent,"
14610,MORAL,"And seeming to whisper, ""All is well!"""
14611,MORAL,A moment only he feels the spell
14612,MORAL,"Of the place and hour, and the secret dread"
14613,MORAL,"Of the lonely belfry and the dead,"
14614,MORAL,For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
14615,MORAL,"On a shadowy something far away,"
14616,MORAL,"Where the river widens to meet the bay,"
14617,MORAL,"A line of black, that bends and floats"
14618,MORAL,"On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats."
14619,MORAL,
14620,MORAL,"Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,"
14621,MORAL,"Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride"
14622,MORAL,On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
14623,MORAL,"Now he patted his horse's side,"
14624,MORAL,"Now gazed on the landscape far and near,"
14625,MORAL,"Then impetuous stamped the earth,"
14626,MORAL,And turned and tightened his saddle girth;
14627,MORAL,But mostly he watched with eager search
14628,MORAL,"The belfry tower of the old North Church,"
14629,MORAL,"As it rose above the graves on the hill,"
14630,MORAL,"Lonely and spectral, and sombre and still."
14631,MORAL,"And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height"
14632,MORAL,"A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!"
14633,MORAL,"He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,"
14634,MORAL,"But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight"
14635,MORAL,A second lamp in the belfry burns.
14636,MORAL,
14637,MORAL,"A harry of hoofs in a village street,"
14638,MORAL,"A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,"
14639,MORAL,"And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark"
14640,MORAL,Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;
14641,MORAL,"That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,"
14642,MORAL,The fate of a nation was riding that night;
14643,MORAL,"And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,"
14644,MORAL,Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
14645,MORAL,"He has left the village and mounted the steep,"
14646,MORAL,"And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,"
14647,MORAL,"Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;"
14648,MORAL,"And under the alders, that skirt its edge,"
14649,MORAL,"Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,"
14650,MORAL,Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.
14651,MORAL,
14652,MORAL,It was twelve by the village clock
14653,MORAL,When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
14654,MORAL,"He heard the crowing of the cock,"
14655,MORAL,"And the barking of the farmer's dog,"
14656,MORAL,"And felt the damp of the river fog,"
14657,MORAL,That rises after the sun goes down.
14658,MORAL,
14659,MORAL,It was one by the village clock
14660,MORAL,"When he galloped into Lexington,"
14661,MORAL,He saw the gilded weathercock
14662,MORAL,"Swim in the moonlight as he passed,"
14663,MORAL,"And the meeting house windows, blank and bare,"
14664,MORAL,Gaze at him with a spectral glare
14665,MORAL,As if they already stood aghast
14666,MORAL,At the bloody work they would look upon.
14667,MORAL,
14668,MORAL,It was two by the village clock
14669,MORAL,When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
14670,MORAL,"He heard the bleating of the flock,"
14671,MORAL,"And the twittering of birds among the trees,"
14672,MORAL,And felt the breath of the morning breeze
14673,MORAL,Blowing over the meadows brown.
14674,MORAL,And one was safe and asleep in his bed
14675,MORAL,"Who at the bridge would be first to fall,"
14676,MORAL,"Who that day would be lying dead,"
14677,MORAL,Pierced by a British musket ball.
14678,MORAL,
14679,MORAL,You know the rest. In the books you have read
14680,MORAL,How the British regulars fired and fled--
14681,MORAL,"How the farmers gave them ball for ball,"
14682,MORAL,"From behind each fence and farmyard wall,"
14683,MORAL,"Chasing the red coats down the lane,"
14684,MORAL,Then crossing the fields to emerge again
14685,MORAL,"Under the trees at the turn of the road,"
14686,MORAL,And only pausing to fire and load.
14687,MORAL,
14688,MORAL,So through the night rode Paul Revere;
14689,MORAL,And so through the night went his cry of alarm
14690,MORAL,To every Middlesex village and farm--
14691,MORAL,"A cry of defiance, and not of fear--"
14692,MORAL,"A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,"
14693,MORAL,And a word that shall echo forever-more;
14694,MORAL,"For borne on the night wind of the past,"
14695,MORAL,"Through all our history to the last,"
14696,MORAL,"In the hour of darkness and peril and need,"
14697,MORAL,The people will waken and listen to hear
14698,MORAL,"The hurrying hoof beats of that steed,"
14699,MORAL,And the midnight message of Paul Revere.

14845,MORAL,Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
14846,MORAL,The globe are but a handful to the tribes
14847,MORAL,That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
14848,MORAL,"Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,"
14849,MORAL,Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
14850,MORAL,"Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,"

14890,MORAL,Existing in a country when it's new;
14891,MORAL,"Nature, who moved in first--a good long while--"
14892,MORAL,"Has things already somewhat her own style,"

14894,MORAL,"Her rustic furniture broke up and scattered,"
14895,MORAL,"Her paintings, which long years ago were done"
14896,MORAL,"By that old splendid artist-king, the sun,"
14897,MORAL,"Torn down and dragged in civilization's gutter,"
14898,MORAL,Or sold to purchase settlers' bread and butter.
14899,MORAL,"She don't want things exposed from porch to closet,"
14900,MORAL,And so she kind o' nags the man who does it.
14901,MORAL,"She carries in her pockets bags of seeds,"
14902,MORAL,As general agent of the thriftiest weeds;
14903,MORAL,"She sends her blackbirds, in the early morn,"
14904,MORAL,To superintend his fields of planted corn;
14905,MORAL,She gives him rain past any duck's desire--
14906,MORAL,Then maybe several weeks of quiet fire;
14907,MORAL,She sails mosquitoes--leeches perched on wings--
14908,MORAL,To poison him with blood-devouring stings;
14909,MORAL,"She loves her ague-muscle to display,"
14910,MORAL,And shake him up--say every other day;
14911,MORAL,"With, thoughtful, conscientious care she makes"
14912,MORAL,"Those travelin' poison-bottles, rattlesnakes;"
14913,MORAL,"She finds time, 'mongst her other family cares,"

14916,MORAL,"Well, when I first infested this retreat,"

14918,MORAL,"But I had come with heart-thrift in my song,"
14919,MORAL,And brought my wife and plunder right along;
14920,MORAL,"I hadn't a round trip ticket to go back,"
14921,MORAL,And if I had there wasn't no railroad track;
14922,MORAL,And drivin' East was what I couldn't endure:
14923,MORAL,I hadn't started on a circular tour.
14924,MORAL,
14925,MORAL,"My girl-wife was as brave as she was good,"

14929,MORAL,"She kep' our little log-house neat as wax,"
14930,MORAL,And once I caught her fooling with my axe.
14931,MORAL,She learned a hundred masculine things to do:
14932,MORAL,"She aimed a shot-gun pretty middlin' true,"
14933,MORAL,"Although in spite of my express desire,"
14934,MORAL,She always shut her eyes before she'd fire.
14935,MORAL,She hadn't the muscle (though she _had_ the heart)
14936,MORAL,In out-door work to take an active part;
14937,MORAL,Though in our firm of Duty and Endeavor
14938,MORAL,She wasn't no silent partner whatsoever.
14939,MORAL,"When I was logging, burning, choppin' wood,"
14940,MORAL,"She'd linger round and help me all she could,"
14941,MORAL,"And keep me fresh-ambitious all the while,"
14942,MORAL,And lifted tons just with her voice and smile.
14943,MORAL,"With no desire my glory for to rob,"
14944,MORAL,She used to stan' around and boss the job;
14945,MORAL,"And when first-class success my hands befell,"
14946,MORAL,"Would proudly say, ""_We_ did that pretty well!"""
14947,MORAL,"She _was_ delicious, both to hear and see--"
14948,MORAL,That pretty wife-girl that kep' house for me.
14949,MORAL,
14950,MORAL,"Well, neighborhoods meant counties in those days;"
14951,MORAL,The roads didn't have accommodating ways;
14952,MORAL,And maybe weeks would pass before she'd see--
14953,MORAL,And much less talk with--any one but me.
14954,MORAL,"The Indians sometimes showed their sun-baked faces,"
14955,MORAL,But they didn't teem with conversational graces;
14956,MORAL,"Some ideas from the birds and trees she stole,"
14957,MORAL,But 'twasn't like talking with a human soul;
14958,MORAL,And finally I thought that I could trace
14959,MORAL,A half heart-hunger peering from her face.
14960,MORAL,Then she would drive it back and shut the door;
14961,MORAL,Of course that only made me see it more.
14962,MORAL,"'Twas hard to see her give her life to mine,"
14963,MORAL,Making a steady effort not to pine;
14964,MORAL,"'Twas hard to hear that laugh bloom out each minute,"
14965,MORAL,And recognize the seeds of sorrow in it.
14966,MORAL,No misery makes a close observer mourn
14967,MORAL,Like hopeless grief with hopeful courage borne;
14968,MORAL,There's nothing sets the sympathies to paining
14969,MORAL,Like a complaining woman uncomplaining.
14970,MORAL,It always draws my breath out into sighs
14971,MORAL,To see a brave look in a woman's eyes.
14972,MORAL,
14973,MORAL,"Well, she went on, as plucky as could be,"
14974,MORAL,"Fighting the foe she thought I did not see,"
14975,MORAL,And using her heart-horticultural powers
14976,MORAL,To turn that forest to a bed of flowers.
14977,MORAL,"You cannot check an unadmitted sigh,"
14978,MORAL,"And so I had to soothe her on the sly,"
14979,MORAL,And secretly to help her draw her load;
14980,MORAL,And soon it came to be an up-hill road.
14981,MORAL,"Hard work bears hard upon the average pulse,"
14982,MORAL,Even with satisfactory results;
14983,MORAL,"But when effects are scarce, the heavy strain"
14984,MORAL,Falls dead and solid on the heart and brain.
14985,MORAL,"And when we're bothered, it will oft occur"
14986,MORAL,We seek blame-timber; and I lit on her;
14987,MORAL,"And looked at her with daily lessening favor,"
14988,MORAL,"For what I knew she couldn't help, to save her."
14989,MORAL,"And Discord, when he once had called and seen us,"
14990,MORAL,"Came round quite often, and edged in between us."
14991,MORAL,
14992,MORAL,"One night, when I came home unusual late,"
14993,MORAL,"Too hungry and too tired to feel first-rate,"
14994,MORAL,Her supper struck me wrong (though I'll allow
14995,MORAL,"She hadn't much to strike with, anyhow);"
14996,MORAL,"And when I went to milk the cows, and found"
14997,MORAL,"They'd wandered from their usual feeding ground,"
14998,MORAL,"And maybe'd left a few long miles behind 'em,"
14999,MORAL,"Which I must copy, if I meant to find 'em,"
15000,MORAL,"Flash-quick the stay-chains of my temper broke,"
15001,MORAL,"And in a, trice these hot words I had spoke:"
15002,MORAL,"""You ought to've kept the animals in view,"
15003,MORAL,And drove 'em in; you'd nothing else to do.
15004,MORAL,The heft of all our life on me must fall;
15005,MORAL,"You just lie round and let me do it all."""
15006,MORAL,
15007,MORAL,That speech--it hadn't been gone a half a minute
15008,MORAL,Before I saw the cold black poison in it;
15009,MORAL,"And I'd have given all I had, and more,"
15010,MORAL,To've only safely got it back in-door.
15011,MORAL,"I'm now what most folks ""well-to-do"" would call"
15012,MORAL,"I feel to-day as if I'd give it all,"
15013,MORAL,Provided I through fifty years might reach
15014,MORAL,And kill and bury that half-minute speech.
15015,MORAL,
15016,MORAL,"She handed back no words, as I could hear;"
15017,MORAL,She didn't frown; she didn't shed a tear;
15018,MORAL,"Half proud, half crushed, she stood and looked me o'er,"
15019,MORAL,Like some one she had never seen before!
15020,MORAL,But such a sudden anguish-lit surprise
15021,MORAL,I never viewed before in human eyes.
15022,MORAL,(I've seen it oft enough since in a dream;
15023,MORAL,It sometimes wakes me like a midnight scream.)
15024,MORAL,
15025,MORAL,"Next morning, when, stone-faced, but heavy-hearted,"
15026,MORAL,With dinner pail and sharpened axe I started
15027,MORAL,Away for my day's work--she watched the door.
15028,MORAL,And followed me half way to it or more;
15029,MORAL,"And I was just a-turning round at this,"
15030,MORAL,And asking for my usual good-by kiss;
15031,MORAL,"But on her lip I saw a proudish curve,"
15032,MORAL,And in her eye a shadow of reserve;
15033,MORAL,And she had shown--perhaps half unawares--
15034,MORAL,Some little independent breakfast airs;
15035,MORAL,"And so the usual parting didn't occur,"
15036,MORAL,Although her eyes invited me to her!
15037,MORAL,"Or rather half invited me, for she"
15038,MORAL,Didn't advertise to furnish kisses free;
15039,MORAL,"You always had--that is, I had--to pay"
15040,MORAL,"Full market price, and go more'n half the way."
15041,MORAL,"So, with a short ""Good-by,"" I shut the door,"
15042,MORAL,And left her as I never had before.
15043,MORAL,But when at noon my lunch I came to eat.
15044,MORAL,Put up by her so delicately neat--
15045,MORAL,"Choicer, somewhat, than yesterday's had been,"
15046,MORAL,"And some fresh, sweet-eyed pansies she'd put in--"
15047,MORAL,"""Tender and pleasant thoughts,"" I knew they meant--"
15048,MORAL,It seemed as if her kiss with me she'd sent;
15049,MORAL,"Then I became once more her humble lover,"
15050,MORAL,"And said, ""To-night I'll ask forgiveness of her."""
15051,MORAL,
15052,MORAL,"I went home over-early on that eve,"
15053,MORAL,"Having contrived to make myself believe,"
15054,MORAL,"By various signs I kind o' knew and guessed,"
15055,MORAL,A thunder-storm was coming from the west.
15056,MORAL,"('Tis strange, when one sly reason fills the heart,"
15057,MORAL,How many honest ones will take its part:
15058,MORAL,A dozen first-class reasons said 'twas right
15059,MORAL,That I should strike home early on that night.)
15060,MORAL,
15061,MORAL,"Half out of breath, the cabin door I swung,"
15062,MORAL,With tender heart-words trembling on my tongue;
15063,MORAL,But all within looked desolate and bare:
15064,MORAL,"My house had lost its soul,--she was not there!"
15065,MORAL,"A penciled note was on the table spread,"
15066,MORAL,And these are something like the words it said:
15067,MORAL,"""The cows have strayed away again, I fear;"
15068,MORAL,"I watched them pretty close; don't scold me, dear."
15069,MORAL,"And where they are, I think I nearly know:"
15070,MORAL,I heard the bell not very long ago....
15071,MORAL,I've hunted for them all the afternoon;
15072,MORAL,I'll try once more--I think I'll find them soon.
15073,MORAL,"Dear, if a burden I have been to you,"
15074,MORAL,And haven't helped you as I ought to do.
15075,MORAL,Let old-time memories my forgiveness plead;
15076,MORAL,I've tried to do my best--I have indeed.
15077,MORAL,"Darling, piece out with love the strength I lack,"
15078,MORAL,"And have kind words for me when I get back."""
15079,MORAL,
15080,MORAL,Scarce did I give this letter sight and tongue--
15081,MORAL,"Some swift-blown rain-drops to the window clung,"
15082,MORAL,"And from the clouds a rough, deep growl proceeded:"
15083,MORAL,"My thunder-storm had come, now 'twasn't needed."
15084,MORAL,I rushed out-door. The air was stained with black:
15085,MORAL,"Night had come early, on the storm-cloud's back:"
15086,MORAL,"And everything kept dimming to the sight,"
15087,MORAL,Save when the clouds threw their electric light;
15088,MORAL,"When for a flash, so clean-cut was the view,"
15089,MORAL,I'd think I saw her--knowing 'twas not true.
15090,MORAL,"Through my small clearing dashed wide sheets of spray,"
15091,MORAL,As if the ocean waves had lost their way;
15092,MORAL,"Scarcely a pause the thunder-battle made,"
15093,MORAL,In the bold clamor of its cannonade.
15094,MORAL,"And she, while I was sheltered, dry, and warm,"
15095,MORAL,Was somewhere in the clutches of this storm!
15096,MORAL,"She who, when storm-frights found her at her best,"
15097,MORAL,Had always hid her white face on my breast!
15098,MORAL,
15099,MORAL,"My dog, who'd skirmished round me all the day,"
15100,MORAL,"Now crouched and whimpering, in a corner lay;"
15101,MORAL,"I dragged him by the collar to the wall,"
15102,MORAL,I pressed his quivering muzzle to a shawl--
15103,MORAL,"""Track her, old boy!"" I shouted; and he whined,"
15104,MORAL,"Matched eyes with me, as if to read my mind,"
15105,MORAL,"Then with a yell went tearing through the wood,"
15106,MORAL,"I followed him, as faithful as I could."
15107,MORAL,"No pleasure-trip was that, through flood and flame;"
15108,MORAL,We raced with death: we hunted noble game.
15109,MORAL,All night we dragged the woods without avail;
15110,MORAL,"The ground got drenched--we could not keep the trail,"
15111,MORAL,"Three times again my cabin home I found,"
15112,MORAL,"Half hoping she might be there, safe and sound;"
15113,MORAL,But each time 'twas an unavailing care:
15114,MORAL,My house had lost its soul; she was not there!
15115,MORAL,
15116,MORAL,"When, climbing--the wet trees, next morning-sun."
15117,MORAL,"Laughed at the ruin that the night had done,"
15118,MORAL,"Bleeding and drenched, by toil and sorrow bent,"
15119,MORAL,Back to what used to be my home I went.
15120,MORAL,But as I neared our little clearing-ground--
15121,MORAL,Listen!--I heard the cow-bell's tinkling sound.
15122,MORAL,The cabin door was just a bit ajar;
15123,MORAL,"It gleamed upon my glad eyes like a star,"
15124,MORAL,"""Brave heart,"" I said, ""for such a fragile form!"
15125,MORAL,"She made them guide her homeward through the storm!"""
15126,MORAL,Such pangs of joy I never felt before.
15127,MORAL,"""You've come!"" I shouted and rushed through the door."
15128,MORAL,
15129,MORAL,"Yes, she had come--and gone again. She lay"
15130,MORAL,With all her young life crushed and wrenched away--
15131,MORAL,"Lay, the heart-ruins of oar home among,"
15132,MORAL,Not far from where I killed her with my tongue.
15133,MORAL,"The rain-drops glittered 'mid her hair's long strands,"
15134,MORAL,"The forest thorns had torn her feet and hands,"
15135,MORAL,And 'midst the tears--brave tears--that one could trace
15136,MORAL,"Upon the pale but sweetly resolute face,"
15137,MORAL,"I once again the mournful words could read,"
15138,MORAL,"""I have tried to do my best--I have, indeed."""
15139,MORAL,
15140,MORAL,And now I'm mostly done; my story's o'er;
15141,MORAL,Part of it never breathed the air before.
15142,MORAL,"'Tisn't over-usual, it must be allowed,"
15143,MORAL,"To volunteer heart-history to a crowd,"
15144,MORAL,"And scatter 'mongst them confidential tears,"
15145,MORAL,But you'll protect an old man with his years;
15146,MORAL,"And wheresoe'er this story's voice can reach,"
15147,MORAL,This is the sermon I would have it preach:
15148,MORAL,
15149,MORAL,Boys flying kites haul in their white-winged birds:
15150,MORAL,You can't do that way when you're flying words.
15151,MORAL,"""Careful with fire,"" is good advice we know:"
15152,MORAL,"""Careful with words,"" is ten times doubly so."
15153,MORAL,"Thoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead,"
15154,MORAL,But God himself can't kill them when they're said!
15155,MORAL,Yon have my life-grief: do not think a minute
15156,MORAL,'Twas told to take up time. There's business in it.
15157,MORAL,"It sheds advice: whoe'er will take and live it,"
15158,MORAL,Is welcome to the pain it cost to give it.

15172,MORAL,"Mother tells me ""Happy dreams!"" and takes away the light,"
15173,MORAL,An' leaves me lying all alone an' seein' things at night!
15174,MORAL,
15175,MORAL,"Sometimes they're in the corner, sometimes they're by the door,"

15336,MORAL,
15337,MORAL,"She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up,"
15338,MORAL,"And filled for him her small tin cup,"
15339,MORAL,
15340,MORAL,"And blushed as she gave it, looking down"
15341,MORAL,"On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown."
15342,MORAL,
15343,MORAL,"""Thanks!"" said the Judge; ""a sweeter draught"
15344,MORAL,"From a fairer hand was never quaffed."""
15345,MORAL,
15346,MORAL,"He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,"
15347,MORAL,Of the singing birds and the humming' bees;
15348,MORAL,
15349,MORAL,"Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether"
15350,MORAL,The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.
15351,MORAL,
15352,MORAL,"And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown,"
15353,MORAL,And her graceful ankles bare and brown;
15354,MORAL,
15355,MORAL,"And listened, while a pleased surprise"
15356,MORAL,Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.
15357,MORAL,
15358,MORAL,"At last, like one who for delay"
15359,MORAL,"Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away."
15360,MORAL,
15361,MORAL,"Maud Muller looked and sighed: ""Ah, me!"
15362,MORAL,That I the Judge's bride might be!
15363,MORAL,
15364,MORAL,"""He would dress me up in silks so fine,"
15365,MORAL,And praise and toast me at his wine.
15366,MORAL,
15367,MORAL,"""My father should wear a broadcloth coat;"
15368,MORAL,My brother should sail a painted boat.
15369,MORAL,
15370,MORAL,"""I'd dress my mother, so grand and gay,"
15371,MORAL,And the baby should have a new toy each day.
15372,MORAL,
15373,MORAL,"""And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor,"
15374,MORAL,"And all should bless me who left our door."""
15375,MORAL,
15376,MORAL,"The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,"
15377,MORAL,And saw Maud Muller standing still.
15378,MORAL,
15379,MORAL,"""A form more fair, a face more sweet."
15380,MORAL,"Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet,"
15381,MORAL,
15382,MORAL,"""And her modest answer and graceful air"
15383,MORAL,Show her wise and good as she is fair.
15384,MORAL,
15385,MORAL,"""Would she were mine, and I to-day,"
15386,MORAL,"Like her, a harvester of hay:"
15387,MORAL,
15388,MORAL,"""No doubtful balance of rights and, wrongs"
15389,MORAL,"Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,"
15390,MORAL,
15391,MORAL,"""But low of cattle and song of birds,"
15392,MORAL,"And health and quiet and loving words."""
15393,MORAL,
15394,MORAL,"But he thought of his sisters proud and cold,"
15395,MORAL,And his mother vain of her rank and gold.
15396,MORAL,
15397,MORAL,"So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,"
15398,MORAL,And Maud was left in the field alone.
15399,MORAL,
15400,MORAL,"But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,"
15401,MORAL,When he hummed in court an old love-tune;
15402,MORAL,
15403,MORAL,And the young girl mused beside the well
15404,MORAL,Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.
15405,MORAL,
15406,MORAL,"He wedded a wife of richest dower,"
15407,MORAL,"Who lived for fashion, as he for power."
15408,MORAL,
15409,MORAL,"Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow,"
15410,MORAL,He watched a picture come and go;
15411,MORAL,
15412,MORAL,And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes
15413,MORAL,Looked out in their innocent surprise.
15414,MORAL,
15415,MORAL,"Oft, when the wine in his glass was red,"
15416,MORAL,He longed for the wayside well instead;
15417,MORAL,
15418,MORAL,And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms
15419,MORAL,To dream of meadows and clover-blooms.
15420,MORAL,
15421,MORAL,"And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain,"
15422,MORAL,"""Ah, that I were free again!"
15423,MORAL,
15424,MORAL,"""Free as when I rode that day,"
15425,MORAL,"Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay."""
15426,MORAL,
15427,MORAL,"She wedded a man unlearned and poor,"
15428,MORAL,And many children played round her door.
15429,MORAL,
15430,MORAL,"But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain,"
15431,MORAL,Left their traces on heart and brain.
15432,MORAL,
15433,MORAL,"And oft, when the summer sun shone hot"
15434,MORAL,"On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,"
15435,MORAL,
15436,MORAL,And she heard the little spring brook fall
15437,MORAL,"Over the roadside, through the wall,"
15438,MORAL,
15439,MORAL,In the shade of the apple-tree again
15440,MORAL,She saw a rider draw his rein.
15441,MORAL,
15442,MORAL,"And, gazing down with timid grace,"
15443,MORAL,She felt his pleased eyes read her face.
15444,MORAL,
15445,MORAL,Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls
15446,MORAL,Stretched away into stately halls;
15447,MORAL,
15448,MORAL,"The weary wheel to a spinnet turned,"
15449,MORAL,"The tallow candle an astral burned,"
15450,MORAL,
15451,MORAL,"And for him who sat by the chimney lug,"
15452,MORAL,"Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug,"
15453,MORAL,
15454,MORAL,"A manly form at her side she saw,"
15455,MORAL,And joy was duty and love was law.
15456,MORAL,
15457,MORAL,"Then she took up her burden of life again,"
15458,MORAL,"Saying only, ""It might have been."""
15459,MORAL,
15460,MORAL,"Alas for maiden, alas for Judge,"
15461,MORAL,For rich repiner and household drudge!
15462,MORAL,
15463,MORAL,"God pity them both! and pity us all,"
15464,MORAL,Who vainly the dreams of youth recall.
15465,MORAL,
15466,MORAL,"For of all sad words of tongue or pen,"
15467,MORAL,"The saddest are these: ""It might have been!"""
15468,MORAL,
15469,MORAL,"Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies"
15470,MORAL,Deeply buried from human eyes;
15471,MORAL,
15472,MORAL,"And, in the hereafter, angels may"
15473,MORAL,Roll the stone from its grave away!

15479,MORAL,
15480,MORAL,Sister and I
15481,MORAL,
15482,MORAL,
15483,MORAL,"We were hunting for wintergreen berries,"
15484,MORAL,"One May-day, long gone by,"
15485,MORAL,"Out on the rocky cliff's edge,"
15486,MORAL,Little sister and I.
15487,MORAL,Sister had hair like the sunbeams;
15488,MORAL,"Black as a crow's wing, mine;"
15489,MORAL,"Sister had blue, dove's eyes;"
15490,MORAL,"Wicked, black eyes are mine."
15491,MORAL,"Why, see how my eyes are faded--"
15492,MORAL,"And my hair, it is white as snow!"
15493,MORAL,"And thin, too! don't you see it is?"
15494,MORAL,I tear it sometimes; so!
15495,MORAL,"There, don't hold my hands, Maggie,"
15496,MORAL,I don't feel like tearing it now;
15497,MORAL,But--where was I in my story?
15498,MORAL,"Oh, I was telling you how"
15499,MORAL,We were looking for wintergreen berries;
15500,MORAL,"'Twas one bright morning in May,"
15501,MORAL,And the moss-grown rocks were slippery
15502,MORAL,With the rains of yesterday.
15503,MORAL,"But I was cross that morning,"
15504,MORAL,Though the sun shone ever so bright--
15505,MORAL,"And when sister found the most berries,"
15506,MORAL,I was angry enough to fight!
15507,MORAL,And when she laughed at my pouting--
15508,MORAL,"We were little things, you know--"
15509,MORAL,"I clinched my little fist up tight,"
15510,MORAL,And struck her the biggest blow!
15511,MORAL,"I struck her--I tell you--I struck her,"
15512,MORAL,And she fell right over below--
15513,MORAL,"There, there, Maggie, I won't rave now;"
15514,MORAL,You needn't hold me so--
15515,MORAL,"She went right over, I tell you,"
15516,MORAL,"Down, down to the depths below!"
15517,MORAL,'Tis deep and dark and horrid
15518,MORAL,There where the waters flow!
15519,MORAL,"She fell right over, moaning,"
15520,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" so sad,"
15521,MORAL,"That, when I looked down affrighted,"
15522,MORAL,It drove me _mad--mad_!
15523,MORAL,Only her golden hair streaming
15524,MORAL,"Out on the rippling wave,"
15525,MORAL,Only her little hand reaching
15526,MORAL,"Up, for someone to save;"
15527,MORAL,"And she sank down in the darkness,"
15528,MORAL,"I never saw her again,"
15529,MORAL,And this is a chaos of blackness
15530,MORAL,And darkness and grief since then.
15531,MORAL,No more playing together
15532,MORAL,Down on the pebbly strand;
15533,MORAL,Nor building our dolls stone castles
15534,MORAL,With halls and parlors grand;
15535,MORAL,"No more fishing with bent pins,"
15536,MORAL,In the little brook's clear waves;
15537,MORAL,No more holding funerals
15538,MORAL,O'er dead canaries' graves;
15539,MORAL,No more walking together
15540,MORAL,To the log schoolhouse each morn;
15541,MORAL,No more vexing the master
15542,MORAL,With putting his rules to scorn;
15543,MORAL,No more feeding of white lambs
15544,MORAL,With milk from the foaming pail;
15545,MORAL,"No more playing ""see-saw"""
15546,MORAL,Over the fence of rail;
15547,MORAL,No more telling of stories
15548,MORAL,After we've gone to bed;
15549,MORAL,Nor talking of ghosts and goblins
15550,MORAL,Till we fairly shiver with dread;
15551,MORAL,No more whispering fearfully
15552,MORAL,"And hugging each other tight,"
15553,MORAL,When the shutters shake and the dogs howl
15554,MORAL,In the middle of the night;
15555,MORAL,"No more saying ""Our Father,"""
15556,MORAL,Kneeling by mother's knee--
15557,MORAL,"For, Maggie, I _struck_ sister!"
15558,MORAL,"And mother is dead, you see."
15559,MORAL,"Maggie, sister's an angel,"
15560,MORAL,Isn't she? Isn't it true?
15561,MORAL,For angels have golden tresses
15562,MORAL,"And eyes like sister's, blue?"
15563,MORAL,"Now _my_ hair isn't golden,"
15564,MORAL,"My eyes aren't blue, you see--"
15565,MORAL,"Now tell me, Maggie, if I were to die,"
15566,MORAL,Could they make an angel of me?
15567,MORAL,"You say, ""Oh, yes""; you think so?"
15568,MORAL,"Well, then, when I come to die,"
15569,MORAL,"We'll play up there, in God's garden--"
15570,MORAL,"We'll play there, sister and I."
15571,MORAL,"Now, Maggie, you needn't eye me"
15572,MORAL,Because I'm talking so queer;
15573,MORAL,Because I'm talking so strangely;
15574,MORAL,"You needn't have the least fear,"
15575,MORAL,"Somehow I'm feeling to-night, Maggie,"
15576,MORAL,As I never felt before--
15577,MORAL,"I'm sure, I'm sure of it, Maggie,"
15578,MORAL,I never shall rave any more.
15579,MORAL,"Maggie, you know how these long years"
15580,MORAL,"I've heard her calling, so sad,"
15581,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" so mournful?"
15582,MORAL,It always drives me _mad_!
15583,MORAL,"How the winter wind shrieks down the chimney,"
15584,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" oh! oh!"
15585,MORAL,"How the south wind wails at the casement,"
15586,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" so low,"
15587,MORAL,But most of all when the May-days
15588,MORAL,"Come back, with the flowers and the sun,"
15589,MORAL,"How the night-bird, singing, all lonely,"
15590,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" doth moan;"
15591,MORAL,You know how it sets me raving--
15592,MORAL,"For _she_ moaned, ""_Oh, Bessie!_"" just so,"
15593,MORAL,"That time I _struck_ little sister,"
15594,MORAL,On the May-day long ago!
15595,MORAL,"Now, Maggie, I've something to tell you--"
15596,MORAL,You know May-day is here--
15597,MORAL,"Well, this very morning, at sunrise,"
15598,MORAL,"The robins chirped ""Bessie!"" so clear--"
15599,MORAL,"All day long the wee birds singing,"
15600,MORAL,"Perched on the garden wall,"
15601,MORAL,"Called ""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" so sweetly,"
15602,MORAL,I couldn't feel sorry at all.
15603,MORAL,"Now, Maggie, I've something to tell you--"
15604,MORAL,Let me lean up to you close--
15605,MORAL,Do you see how the sunset has flooded
15606,MORAL,The heavens with yellow and rose?
15607,MORAL,Do you see o'er the gilded cloud mountains
15608,MORAL,Sister's golden hair streaming out?
15609,MORAL,Do you see her little hand beckoning?
15610,MORAL,Do you hear her little voice calling out
15611,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie!"" so gladly,"
15612,MORAL,"""Bessie, oh, Bessie! Come, haste""?"
15613,MORAL,"Yes, sister, I'm coming; I'm coming,"
15614,MORAL,To play in God's garden at last!
