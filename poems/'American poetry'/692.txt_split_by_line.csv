52,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
53,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"All who knew Mr. Clark intimately, casually,"
54,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"or by sight alone, smiled always, meeting"
55,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"him, and thought, ""What an odd man he is!""  Not"
56,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,that there was anything extremely or ridiculously
57,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,obtrusive in Mr. Clark's peculiarities either of
58,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"feature, dress, or deportment, by which a graded"
59,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,estimate of his really quaint character might aptly be
60,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"given; but rather, perhaps, it was the curious"
61,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,combination of all these things that had gained
62,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,for Mr. Clark the transient celebrity of being a
63,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,very eccentric man.
64,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
65,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"And Mr. Clark, of all the odd inhabitants of the"
66,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"busy metropolis in which he lived, seemed least"
67,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,conscious of the fact of his local prominence.  True
68,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"it was that when familiarly addressed as ""Clark,"
69,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"old boy,"" by sportive individuals he never recollected"
70,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"having seen before, he would oftentimes stare"
71,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"blankly in return, and with evident embarrassment;"
72,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,but as these actions may have been attributable to
73,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"weak eyes, or to the confusion consequent upon"
74,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,being publicly recognized by the quondam associates
75,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"of bacchanalian hours, the suggestive facts only"
76,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,served to throw his eccentricities in new relief.
77,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
78,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"And in the minds of many, that Mr. Clark was somewhat given to"
79,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"dissipation, there was but little"
80,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"doubt; for, although in no way, and at no time,"
81,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,derelict in the rigid duties imposed upon him as
82,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,an accountant in a wholesale liquor house on South
83,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"John Street, a grand majority of friends had long"
84,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,ago conceded that a certain puffiness of flesh and
85,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,a soiled-like pallor of complexion were in nowise
86,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the legitimate result of over-application simply in
87,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the counting-room of the establishment in which he
88,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,found employment; but as to the complicity of Mr.
89,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Clark's direct associates in this belief, it is only"
90,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,justice to the gentleman to state that by them
91,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"he was held above all such suspicion, from the"
92,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"gray-haired senior of the firm, down to the pink-"
93,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"nosed porter of the warerooms, who, upon every"
94,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"available occasion, would point out the eccentric"
95,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Mr. Clark as ""the on'y man in the biznez 'at never"
96,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,sunk a 'thief' er drunk a drop o' 'goods' o' any
97,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"kind, under no consideration!"""
98,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
99,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"And Mr. Clark himself, when playfully"
100,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"approached on the subject, would quietly assert that"
101,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"never, under any circumstances, had the taste of"
102,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"intoxicating liquors passed his lips, though at such"
103,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,asseverations it was a noticeable fact that Mr.
104,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,Clark's complexion invariably grew more sultry
105,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"than its wont, and that his eyes, forever moist, grew"
106,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"dewier, and that his lips and tongue would seem"
107,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"covertly entering upon some lush conspiracy, which"
108,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,in its incipiency he would be forced to smother with
109,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,his hastily drawn handkerchief.  Then the eccentric
110,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Mr. Clark would laugh nervously, and pouncing"
111,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,on some subject so vividly unlike the one just
112,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"preceding it as to daze the listener, he would ripple"
113,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,ahead with a tide of eloquence that positively
114,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,overflowed and washed away all remembrance of the
115,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,opening topic.
116,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
117,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"In point of age Mr. Clark might have been thirty,"
118,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"thirty-five, or even forty years, were one to venture"
119,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,an opinion solely by outward appearance and under
120,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"certain circumstances and surroundings.  As, for"
121,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"example, when a dozen years ago the writer of this"
122,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,sketch rode twenty miles in a freight-caboose with
123,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Mr. Clark as the only other passenger, he seemed"
124,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,in age at first not less than thirty-five; but on
125,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"opening a conversation with him, in which he joined"
126,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"with wonderful vivacity, a nearer view, and a"
127,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"prolonged and studious one as well, revealed the rather"
128,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"curious fact that, at the very limit of all allowable"
129,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"supposition, his age could not possibly have exceeded"
130,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,twenty-five.
131,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
132,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,What it was in the man that struck me as
133,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,eccentric at that time I have never been wholly
134,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"able to define, but I recall accurately the most"
135,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,trivial occurrences of our meeting and the very
136,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,subject-matter of our conversation.  I even remember
137,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the very words in which he declined a drink
138,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"from my traveling-flask--for ""It's a raw day,"" I"
139,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"said, by way of gratuitous excuse for offering it."
140,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Yes,"" he said, smilingly motioning the temptation"
141,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"aside; ""it is a raw day; but you're rather young in"
142,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,years to be doctoring the weather--at least you'd
143,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,better change the treatment--they'll all be raw days
144,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"for you after a while!""  I confess that I even"
145,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,felt an inward pity for the man as I laughingly
146,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,drained his health and returned the flask to my
147,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"valise.  But when I asked him, ten minutes later,"
148,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the nature of the business in which he was engaged,"
149,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and he handed me, in response and without comment,"
150,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the card of a wholesale liquor house, with"
151,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,his own name in crimson letters struck diagonally
152,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"across the surface, I winked naively to myself and"
153,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"thought ""Ah-ha!""  And as if reading my very"
154,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"musings, he said:  ""Why, certainly, I carry a full"
155,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"line of samples; but, my dear young friend, don't"
156,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,imagine for a minute that I refuse your brand on
157,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,that account.  You can rest assured that I have
158,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,nothing better in my cases.  Whisky is whisky
159,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"wherever it is found, and there is no 'best'"
160,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"whisky--not in all the world!"""
161,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
162,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Truly, I thought, this is an odd source for the"
163,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,emanation of temperance sentiments--then said
164,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"aloud:  ""And yet you engage in a business you"
165,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,dislike!  Traffic in an article that you yourself
166,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"condemn!  Do I understand you?"""
167,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
168,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Might there not be such a thing,"" he said"
169,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"quietly, ""as inheriting a business--the same as"
170,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"inheriting an appetite?  However, one advances by"
171,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,gradations:  I shall SELL no more.  This is my last
172,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,trip on the road in that capacity:  I am coming in
173,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,now to take charge of the firm's books.  Would be
174,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,glad to have you call on me any time you're in the
175,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"city.  Good-by.""  And, as he swung off the slowly"
176,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"moving train, now entering the city, and I stood"
177,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,watching him from the open door of the caboose
178,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"as he rapidly walked down a suburban street, I"
179,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,was positive his gait was anything but steady--that
180,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the step--the figure--the whole air of the man was
181,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,that of one then laboring under the effects of
182,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,partial intoxication.
183,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
184,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,I have always liked peculiar people; no matter
185,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"where I met them, no matter who they were; if"
186,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,once impressed with an eccentricity of character
187,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"which I have reason to believe purely unaffected, I"
188,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"never quite forget the person, name or place of"
189,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"our first meeting, or where the interesting party"
190,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,may be found again.  And so it was in the customary
191,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"order of things that, during hasty visits to the"
192,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"city, I often called on the eccentric Mr. Clark, and,"
193,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"as he had promised on our first acquaintance, he"
194,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,seemed always glad to see and welcome me in his
195,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,new office.  The more I knew of him the more I
196,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"liked him, but I think I never fully understood him."
197,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,No one seemed to know him quite so well as that.
198,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
199,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,Once I had a little private talk regarding him with
200,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the senior partner of the firm for which he worked.
201,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Mr. Clark, just prior to my call, had gone to lunch--"
202,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,would be back in half an hour.  Would I wait there
203,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,in the office until his return?  Certainly.  And the
204,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,chatty senior entertained me:--Queer fellow--Mr.
205,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,Clark!--as his father was before him.  Used to be
206,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"a member of the firm--his father; in fact, founded"
207,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the business--made a fortune at it--failed, for an"
208,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"unfortunate reason, and went ""up the flume.""  Paid"
209,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"every dollar that he owed, however, sacrificing the"
210,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,very home that sheltered his wife and children--
211,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"but never rallied.  He had quite a family, then?"
212,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Oh, yes; had a family--not a large one, but a"
213,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,bright one--only they all seemed more or less
214,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,unfortunate.  The father was unfortunate--very; and
215,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"died so, leaving his wife and two boys--the older"
216,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,son much like the father--splendid business
217,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"capacities, but lacked will--couldn't resist some things"
218,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"--even weaker than the father in that regard, and"
219,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,died at half his age.
220,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
221,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,But the younger brother--our Mr. Clark--
222,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"remained, and he was sterling--""straight goods"" in"
223,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,all respects.  Lived with his mother--was her
224,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"sole support.  A proud woman, Mrs. Clark--"
225,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"a proud woman, with a broken spirit--withdrawn"
226,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"entirely from the world, and had been"
227,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"so for years and years.  The Clarks, as had been"
228,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"mentioned, were all peculiar--even the younger Mr."
229,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Clark, our friend, I had doubtless noticed was an"
230,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"odd genius, but he had stamina--something solid"
231,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"about him, for all his eccentricities--could be relied"
232,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,on.  Had been with the house there since a boy
233,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,of twelve--took him for the father's sake; had never
234,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,missed a day's time in any line of work that ever
235,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"had been given in his charge--was weakly-looking,"
236,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,too.  Had worked his way from the cellar up--from
237,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the least pay to the highest--had saved enough to
238,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,buy and pay for a comfortable house for his mother
239,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and himself, and, still a lad, maintained the"
240,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"expense of companion, attendant and maid servant for"
241,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the mother.  Yet, with all this burden on his"
242,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"shoulders, the boy had worried through some way, with"
243,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"a jolly smile and a good word for every one.  ""A"
244,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"boy, sir,"" the enthusiastic senior concluded--""a boy,"
245,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"sir, that never was a boy, and never had a taste of"
246,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,genuine boyhood in his life--no more than he ever
247,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"took a taste of whisky, and you couldn't get that"
248,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"in him with a funnel!"""
249,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
250,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"At this juncture Mr. Clark himself appeared, and"
251,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,in a particularly happy frame of mind.  For an
252,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,hour the delighted senior and myself sat laughing at
253,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the fellow's quaint conceits and witty sayings, the"
254,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,conversation at last breaking up with an abrupt
255,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,proposition from Mr. Clark that I remain in the
256,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"city overnight and accompany him to the theater,"
257,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"an invitation I rather eagerly accepted.  Mr. Clark,"
258,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"thanking me, and pivoting himself around on his"
259,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"high stool, with a mechanical ""Good afternoon!"""
260,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"was at once submerged in his books, while the senior,"
261,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,following me out and stepping into a carriage that
262,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"stood waiting for him at the curb, waved me adieu,"
263,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and was driven away.  I turned my steps up the
264,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"street, but remembering that my friend had fixed no"
265,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"place to meet me in the evening, I stepped back into"
266,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the storeroom and again pushed open the glass door
267,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,of the office.
268,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
269,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Mr. Clark still sat on the high stool at his desk,"
270,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"his back toward the door, and his ledger spread out"
271,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,before him.
272,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
273,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Mr. Clark!"" I called."
274,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
275,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,He made no answer.
276,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
277,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Mr. Clark!"" I called again, in an elevated key."
278,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
279,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,He did not stir.
280,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
281,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I paused a moment, then went over to him, letting"
282,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,my hand drop lightly on his arm.
283,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
284,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Still no response.  I only felt the shoulder heave,"
285,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"as with a long-drawn quavering sigh, then heard the"
286,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,regular though labored breathing of a weary man
287,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,that slept.
288,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
289,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,I had not the heart to waken him; but lifting the
290,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"still moistened pen from his unconscious fingers, I"
291,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"wrote where I might be found at eight that evening,"
292,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"folded and addressed the note, and laying it on"
293,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the open page before him, turned quietly away."
294,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
295,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Poor man!"" I mused compassionately, with a"
296,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"touch of youthful sentiment affecting me.--""Poor"
297,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"man!  Working himself into his very grave, and"
298,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,with never a sign or murmur of complaint--worn
299,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and weighed down with the burden of his work, and"
300,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,yet with a nobleness of spirit and resolve that still
301,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,conceals behind glad smiles and laughing words
302,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the cares that lie so heavily upon him!"""
303,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
304,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"The long afternoon went by at last, and evening"
305,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"came; and, as promptly as my note requested, the"
306,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"jovial Mr. Clark appeared, laughing heartily, as"
307,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"we walked off down the street, at my explanation"
308,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,of the reason I had written my desires instead of
309,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,verbally addressing him; and laughing still louder
310,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,when I told him of my fears that he was overworking
311,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,himself.
312,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
313,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Oh, no, my friend,"" he answered gaily;"
314,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""there's no occasion for anxiety on that account.--"
315,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"But the fact is, old man,"" he went on, half apologetically,"
316,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""the fact is, I haven't been so overworked,"
317,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"of late, as over-wakeful.  There's something in the"
318,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"night I think, that does it.  Do you know that the"
319,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,night is a great mystery to me--a great mystery!
320,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,And it seems to be growing on me all the time.
321,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,There's the trouble.  The night to me is like some
322,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,vast incomprehensible being.  When I write the
323,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,name 'night' I instinctively write it with a capital.
324,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"And I like my night deep, and dark, and swarthy,"
325,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,don't you know.  Now some like clear and starry
326,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"nights, but they're too pale for me--too weak and"
327,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,fragile altogether!  They're popular with the
328,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"masses, of course, these blue-eyed, golden-haired,"
329,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"'moonlight-on-the-lake' nights; but, somehow, I"
330,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,don't 'stand in' with them.  My favorite night is
331,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the pronounced brunette--the darker the better.  To-
332,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"night is one of my kind, and she's growing more"
333,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and more like it all the time.  If it were not for
334,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"depriving you of the theater, I'd rather just drift"
335,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,off now in the deepening gloom till swallowed up
336,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"in it--lost utterly.  Come with me, anyhow!"""
337,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
338,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Gladly,"" I answered, catching something of his"
339,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"own enthusiasm; ""I myself prefer it to the play."""
340,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
341,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""I heartily congratulate you on your taste,"" he"
342,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"said, diving violently for my hand and wringing it."
343,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
344,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Oh, it's going to be grimly glorious!--a depth of"
345,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"darkness one can wade out into, and knead in his"
346,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"hands like dough!""  And he laughed, himself, at"
347,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,this grotesque conceit.
348,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
349,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"And so we walked--for hours.  Our talk--or,"
350,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"rather, my friend's talk--lulled and soothed at last"
351,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"into a calmer flow, almost solemn in its tone, and"
352,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,yet fretted with an occasional wildness of utterance
353,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and expression.
354,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
355,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Half consciously I had been led by my companion,"
356,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,who for an hour had been drawing closer to me
357,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"as we walked.  His arm, thrust through my own,"
358,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,clung almost affectionately.  We were now in some
359,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"strange suburb of the city, evidently, too, in a low"
360,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"quarter, for from the windows of such business"
361,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,rooms and shops as bore any evidence of respectability
362,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the lights had been turned out and the doors
363,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,locked for the night.  Only a gruesome green light
364,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"was blazing in a little drug-store just opposite,"
365,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"while at our left, as we turned the corner, a tumble-"
366,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,down saloon sent out on the night a mingled
367,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"sound of clicking billiard-balls, discordant voices,"
368,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the harsher rasping of a violin, together with the"
369,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,sullen plunkings of a banjo.
370,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
371,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""I must leave you here for a minute,"" said my"
372,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"friend, abruptly breaking a long silence, and loosening"
373,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"my arm.  ""The druggist over there is a patron"
374,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"of our house, and I am reminded of a little business"
375,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I have with him.  He is about closing, too, and"
376,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I'll see him now, as I may not be down this way"
377,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"again soon.  No; you wait here for me--right here,"""
378,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and he playfully but firmly pushed me back, ran"
379,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"across the street, and entered the store.  Through"
380,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the open door I saw him shake hands with the man
381,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"who stood behind the counter, and stand talking"
382,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,in the same position for some minutes--both still
383,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"clasping hands, as it seemed; but as I mechanically"
384,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"bent with closer scrutiny, the druggist seemed to be"
385,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,examining the hand of Mr. Clark and working at
386,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"it, as though picking at a splinter in the palm--I"
387,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I could not quite determine what was being done,"
388,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,for a glass show-case blurred an otherwise clear
389,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,view of the arms of both from the elbows down.
390,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Then they came forward, Mr. Clark arranging his"
391,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"cuffs, and the druggist wrapping up some minute"
392,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"article he took from an upper show-case, and handing"
393,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"it to my friend, who placed it in the pocket of"
394,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,his vest and turned away.  At this moment my
395,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,attention was withdrawn by an extra tumult of jeers
396,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and harsh laughter in the saloon, from the door of"
397,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"which, even as my friend turned from the door"
398,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"opposite, a drunken woman reeled, and staggering"
399,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"round the corner as my friend came up, fell"
400,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"violently forward on the pavement, not ten steps in"
401,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"our advance.  Instinctively, we both sprang to her"
402,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"aid, and bending over the senseless figure, peered"
403,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,curiously at the bruised and bleeding features.  My
404,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,friend was trembling with excitement.  He clutched
405,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"wildly at the limp form, trying, but vainly, to lift the"
406,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"woman to her feet.  ""Why don't you take hold of"
407,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"her?"" he whispered hoarsely.  ""Help me with her--"
408,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"quick! quick!  Lift her up!""  I obeyed without a"
409,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"word, though with a shudder of aversion as a drop"
410,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,of hot red blood stung me on the hand.
411,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
412,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Now draw her arm about your shoulder--this"
413,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,way--and hold it so!  And now your other arm
414,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"around her waist--quick, man, quick, as you yourself"
415,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,will want God's arm about you when you fail!
416,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Now, come!""  And with no other word we hurried"
417,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,with our burden up the empty darkness of the
418,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,street.
419,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
420,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I was utterly bewildered with it all, but something"
421,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"kept me silent.  And so we hurried on, and on, and"
422,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"on, our course directed by my now wholly reticent"
423,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"companion.  Where he was going, what his purpose"
424,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"was, I could not but vaguely surmise.  I only recognized"
425,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"that his intentions were humane, which fact"
426,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,was emphasized by the extreme caution he took to
427,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,avoid the two or three late pedestrians that passed
428,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,us on our way as we stood crowded in concealment
429,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"--once behind a low shed, once in an entry-way;"
430,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and once, at the distant rattle of a police whistle,"
431,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,we hurried through the blackness of a narrow alley
432,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,into the silent street beyond.  And on up this we
433,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"passed, until at last we paused at the gateway of a"
434,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"cottage on our left.  On to the door of that we went,"
435,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"my friend first violently jerking the bell, then opening"
436,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the door with a night-key, and with me lifting"
437,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the still senseless woman through the hall into a
438,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"dimly lighted room upon the right, and laying her"
439,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,upon a clean white bed that glimmered in the corner.
440,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"He reached and turned the gas on in a flaring jet,"
441,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and as he did so, ""This is my home,"" he whispered,"
442,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""and this woman is--my mother!""  He flung himself"
443,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,upon his knees beside her as he spoke.  He laid
444,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,his quivering lips against the white hair and the
445,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,ruddy wound upon the brow; then dappled with his
446,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"kisses the pale face, and stroked and petted and"
447,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"caressed the faded hands.  ""O God!"" he moaned, ""if"
448,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I might only weep!"""
449,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
450,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,The steps of some one coming down the stairs
451,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"aroused him.  He stepped quickly to the door, and"
452,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,threw it open.  It was a woman servant.  He
453,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,simply pointed to the form upon the bed.
454,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
455,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Oh, sir!"" exclaimed the frightened woman,"
456,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""what has happened?  What has happened to my"
457,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"poor dear mistress?"""
458,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
459,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Why did you let her leave the house?"""
460,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
461,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""She sent me away, sir.  I never dreamed that"
462,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,she was going out again.  She told me she was very
463,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"sleepy and wanted to retire, and I helped her to"
464,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"undress before I went.  But she ain't bad hurt, is"
465,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"she?"" she continued, stooping over the still figure"
466,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and tenderly smoothing back the disheveled hair.
467,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"--""It's only the cheek bruised and the forehead cut"
468,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,a little--it's the blood that makes it look like a bad
469,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"hurt.  See, when I bathe it, it is not a bad hurt, sir."
470,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"She's just been--she's just worn out, poor thing--"
471,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and she's asleep--that's all."""
472,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
473,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"He made no answer to the woman's speech, but"
474,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"turned toward me.  ""Five doors from here,"" he"
475,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"said, ""and to your left as you go out, you will find"
476,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the residence of Dr. Worrel.  Go to him for me, and"
477,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,tell him he is wanted here at once.  Tell him my
478,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,mother is much worse.  He will understand.  I
479,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"would go myself, but must see about arranging for"
480,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"your comfort upon your return, for you will not"
481,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"leave me till broad daylight--you must not!""  I"
482,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"bowed in silent acceptance of his wishes, and turned"
483,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,upon my errand.
484,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
485,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Fortunately, the doctor was at home, and"
486,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"returned at once with me to my friend, where, after a"
487,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"careful examination of his patient, he assured the"
488,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"anxious son that the wounds were only slight, and"
489,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"that her unconscious condition was simply ""the result"
490,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"of over-stimulation, perhaps,"" as he delicately"
491,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,put it.  She would doubtless waken in her usual
492,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,rational state--an occurrence really more to be
493,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"feared than desired, since her peculiar sensitiveness"
494,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,might feel too keenly the unfortunate happening.
495,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Anyway,"" he continued, ""I will call early in the"
496,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"morning, and, in the event of her awakening before"
497,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"that time, I will leave a sedative with Mary, with"
498,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,directions she will attend to.  She will remain here
499,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"at her side.  And as to yourself, Mr. Clark,"" the"
500,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"doctor went on in an anxious tone, as he marked the"
501,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"haggard face and hollow eyes, ""I insist that you"
502,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"retire.  You must rest, sir--worrying for the past"
503,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,week as you have been doing is telling on you
504,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"painfully.  You need rest--and you must take it."""
505,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
506,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""And I will,"" said Mr. Clark submissively."
507,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Stooping again, he clasped the sleeping face between"
508,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"his hands and kissed it tenderly.  ""Good night!""  I"
509,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"heard him whisper--""good night-good night!""  He"
510,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"turned, and motioning for me to follow, opened the"
511,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"door--""Doctor, good night!  Good night, Mary!"""
512,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
513,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"He led the way to his own room up-stairs.  ""And"
514,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"now, my friend,"" he said, as he waved me to an easy"
515,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"chair, ""I have but two other favors to ask of you:"
516,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"The first is, that you talk to me, or read to me, or"
517,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"tell me fairy tales, or riddles--anything, so that you"
518,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"keep it up incessantly, and never leave off till you"
519,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,find me fast asleep.  Then in the next room you
520,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,will find a comfortable bed.  Leave me sleeping
521,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"here, and you sleep there.  And the second favor,"""
522,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"he continued, with a slow smile and an affected air"
523,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"of great deliberation--""oh, well, I'll not ask the"
524,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,second favor of you now.  I'll keep it for you till
525,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"to-morrow.""  And as he turned laughingly away and"
526,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"paced three or four times across the room, in his"
527,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"step, his gait, the general carriage of the figure, I"
528,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"was curiously reminded of the time, years before,"
529,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"that I had watched him from the door of the caboose,"
530,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,as he walked up the suburban street till the
531,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,movement of the train had hidden him from view.
532,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
533,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Well, what will you do?"" he asked, as he wheeled"
534,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"a cozy-cushioned lounge close beside my chair, and"
535,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"removing his coat, flung himself languidly down.--"
536,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Will you talk or read to me?"""
537,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
538,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""I will read,"" I said, as I picked up a book to"
539,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,begin my vigil.
540,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
541,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Hold just a minute, then,"" he said, drawing a"
542,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"card and pencil from his vest.--""I may want to"
543,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"jot down a note or two.--Now, go ahead."""
544,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
545,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,I had been reading in a low voice steadily for
546,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"perhaps an hour, my companion never stirring from"
547,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"his first position, but although my eyes were never"
548,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"lifted from the book, I knew by the occasional sound"
549,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,of his pencil that he had not yet dropped asleep.
550,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"And so, without a pause, I read monotonously on."
551,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,At last he turned heavily.  I paused.  With his eyes
552,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,closed he groped his hand across my knees and
553,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"grasped my own.  ""Go on with the reading,"" he"
554,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"said drowsily--""Guess I'm going to sleep now--but"
555,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"you go right on with the story.--Good night!""  His"
556,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"hand fumbled lingeringly a moment, then was withdrawn"
557,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and folded with the other on his breast.
558,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
559,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I read on in a lower tone an hour longer, then"
560,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,paused again to look at my companion.  He was
561,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"sleeping heavily, and although the features in their"
562,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"repose appeared unusually pale, a wholesome perspiration,"
563,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"as it seemed, pervaded all the face, while the"
564,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"breathing, though labored, was regular.  I bent"
565,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"above him to lower the pillow for his head, and the"
566,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"movement half aroused him, as I thought at first,"
567,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,for he muttered something as though impatiently;
568,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"but listening to catch his mutterings, I knew that"
569,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"he was dreaming.  ""It's what killed father,"" I heard"
570,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"him say.  ""And it's what killed Tom,"" he went on,"
571,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"in a smothered voice; ""killed both--killed both!  It"
572,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,shan't kill me; I swear it.  I could bottle it--case
573,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,after case--and never touch a drop.  If you never
574,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"take the first drink, you'll never want it.  Mother"
575,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,taught me that.  What made her ever take the first?
576,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Mother! mother!  When I get to be a man, I'll"
577,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,buy her all the fine things she used to have when
578,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,father was alive.  Maybe I can buy back the old
579,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"home, with the roses up the walk and the sunshine"
580,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"slanting in the hall."""
581,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
582,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
583,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,And so the sleeper murmured on.  Sometimes
584,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"the voice was thick and discordant, sometimes low"
585,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"and clear and tuneful as a child's.  ""Never touch"
586,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"whisky!"" he went on, almost harshly.  ""Never--"
587,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,never!  Drop in the street first.  I did.  The doctor
588,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"will come then, and he knows what you want.  Not"
589,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,whisky.--Medicine; the kind that makes you warm
590,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,again--makes you want to live; but don't ever dare
591,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,touch whisky.  Let other people drink it if they
592,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,want it.  Sell it to them; they'll get it anyhow; but
593,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"don't you touch it!  It killed your father, it killed"
594,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Tom, and--oh!--mother! mother! mother!""  Tears"
595,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"actually teemed from underneath the sleeper's lids,"
596,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and glittered down the pallid and distorted features.
597,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""There's a medicine that's good for you when you"
598,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"want whisky,"" he went on.--""When you are weak,"
599,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,and everybody else is strong--and always when the
600,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"flagstones give way beneath your feet, and the long"
601,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"street undulates and wavers as you walk; why,"
602,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,that's a sign for you to take that medicine--and
603,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"take it quick!  Oh, it will warm you till the little"
604,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,pale blue streaks in your white hands will bulge out
605,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"again with tingling blood, and it will start up from"
606,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,its stagnant pools and leap from vein to vein till it
607,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,reaches your being's furthest height and droops and
608,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,falls and folds down over icy brow and face like a
609,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,soft veil moistened with pure warmth.  Ah! it is
610,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"so deliriously sweet and restful!"""
611,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
612,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I heard a moaning in the room below, and then"
613,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"steps on the stairs, and a tapping at the door.  It"
614,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,was Mary.  Mrs. Clark had awakened and was
615,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"crying for her son.  ""But we must not waken him,"" I"
616,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"said.  ""Give Mrs. Clark the medicine the doctor left"
617,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"for her--that will quiet her."""
618,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
619,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""But she won't take it, sir.  She won't do"
620,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,anything at all for me--and if Mr. Clark could only
621,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"come to her, for just a minute, she would--"""
622,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
623,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,The woman's speech was broken by a shrill cry
624,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"in the hall, and then the thud of naked feet on the"
625,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"stairway.  ""I want my boy--my boy!"" wailed the"
626,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,hysterical woman from without.
627,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
628,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Go to your mistress--quick,"" I said sternly,"
629,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"pushing the maid from the room.--""Take her back;"
630,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I will come down to your assistance in a moment."""
631,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,Then I turned hastily to see if the sleeper had been
632,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,disturbed by the woman's cries; but all was peaceful
633,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"with him yet; and so, throwing a coverlet over"
634,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"him, I drew the door to silently and went below."
635,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
636,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,I found the wretched mother in an almost frenzied
637,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"state, and her increasing violence alarmed"
638,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,me so that I thought it best to summon the physician
639,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,again; and bidding the servant not to leave
640,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"her for an instant, I hurried for the help so badly"
641,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"needed.  This time the doctor was long delayed,"
642,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"although he joined me with all possible haste, and"
643,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,with all speed accompanied me back to the unhappy
644,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"home.  Entering the door, our ears were greeted"
645,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,with a shriek that came piercing down the hall till
646,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the very echoes shuddered as with fear.  It was the
647,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,patient's voice shrilling from the sleeper's room up
648,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"stairs:--""O God!  My boy! my boy!  I want my"
649,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"boy, and he will not waken for me!""  An instant"
650,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,later we were both upon the scene.
651,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
652,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,The woman in her frenzy had broken from the
653,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,servant to find her son.  And she had found him.
654,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
655,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"She had wound her arms about him, and had"
656,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,dragged his still sleeping form upon the floor.  He
657,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"would not waken, even though she gripped him to"
658,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,her heart and shrieked her very soul out in his ears.
659,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"He would not waken.  The face, though whiter"
660,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"than her own, betokened only utter rest and peace."
661,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"We drew her, limp and voiceless, from his side."
662,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""We are too late,"" the doctor whispered, lifting with"
663,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"his finger one of the closed lids, and letting it drop"
664,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"to again.--""See here!""  He had been feeling at the"
665,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"wrist; and, as he spoke, he slipped the sleeve up,"
666,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,bared the sleeper's arm.  From the wrist to elbow it
667,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"was livid purple, and pitted and scarred with minute"
668,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,wounds--some scarcely scaled as yet with clotted
669,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,blood.
670,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
671,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""In heaven's name, what does it all mean?"" I"
672,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,asked.
673,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
674,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""Morphine,"" said the doctor, ""and the"
675,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"hypodermic.  And here,"" he exclaimed, lifting the other"
676,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"hand--""here is a folded card with your name at the"
677,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"top."""
678,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
679,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"I snatched it from him, and I read, written in"
680,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,faint but rounded characters:
681,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
682,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,
683,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"""I like to hear your voice.  It sounds kind.  It is"
684,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"like a far-off tune.  To drop asleep, though, as I"
685,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"am doing now, is sweeter music--but read on.--I"
686,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"have taken something to make me sleep, and by"
687,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,mistake I have taken too much; but you will read
688,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"right on.  Now, mind you, this is not suicide, as"
689,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,God listens to the whisper of this pencil as I write!
690,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,I did it by mistake.  For years and years I have
691,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,taken the same thing.  This time I took too much--
692,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,much more than I meant to--but I am glad.  This
693,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,is the second favor I would ask:  Go to my employers
694,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"to-morrow, show them this handwriting, and"
695,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,say I know for my sake they will take charge of
696,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,my affairs and administer all my estate in the best
697,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"way suited to my mother's needs.  Good-by, my"
698,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,friend--I can only say 'good night' to you when I

703,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"Through tears I read it all, and ending with his"

705,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,"of this man that I had learned to love, and the"
706,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,full measure of his needed rest was with him; and
707,ECCENTRIC MR. CLARK,the rainy day that glowered and drabbled at the

715,A NEST-EGG,"But a few miles from the city here, and on the"
716,A NEST-EGG,sloping banks of the stream noted more for its
717,A NEST-EGG,"plenitude of ""chubs"" and ""shiners"" than the gamier"
718,A NEST-EGG,"two- and four-pound bass for which, in season, so"
719,A NEST-EGG,"many credulous anglers flock and lie in wait, stands"
720,A NEST-EGG,"a country residence, so convenient to the stream,"
721,A NEST-EGG,and so inviting in its pleasant exterior and
722,A NEST-EGG,"comfortable surroundings--barn, dairy, and spring-"
723,A NEST-EGG,"house--that the weary, sunburned, and disheartened"
724,A NEST-EGG,"fisherman, out from the dusty town for a day of"
725,A NEST-EGG,"recreation, is often wont to seek its hospitality."
726,A NEST-EGG,
727,A NEST-EGG,The house in style of architecture is something of
728,A NEST-EGG,"a departure from the typical farmhouse, being"
729,A NEST-EGG,designed and fashioned with no regard to symmetry
730,A NEST-EGG,"or proportion, but rather, as is suggested, built to"
731,A NEST-EGG,conform to the matter-of-fact and most sensible
732,A NEST-EGG,"ideas of its owner, who, if it pleased him, would"
733,A NEST-EGG,"have small windows where large ones ought to be,"
734,A NEST-EGG,"and vice versa, whether they balanced properly to"
735,A NEST-EGG,the eye or not.  And chimneys--he would have as
736,A NEST-EGG,"many as he wanted, and no two alike, in either"
737,A NEST-EGG,height or size.  And if he wanted the front of the
738,A NEST-EGG,"house turned from all possible view, as though"
739,A NEST-EGG,"abashed at any chance of public scrutiny, why, that"
740,A NEST-EGG,"was his affair and not the public's; and, with like"
741,A NEST-EGG,"perversity, if he chose to thrust his kitchen under the public's"
742,A NEST-EGG,"very nose, what should the generally"
743,A NEST-EGG,"fagged-out, half-famished representative of that"
744,A NEST-EGG,"dignified public do but reel in his dead minnow,"
745,A NEST-EGG,"shoulder his fishing-rod, clamber over the back"
746,A NEST-EGG,"fence of the old farmhouse and inquire within, or"
747,A NEST-EGG,"jog back to the city, inwardly anathematizing that"
748,A NEST-EGG,particular locality or the whole rural district
749,A NEST-EGG,in general.  That is just the way that farmhouse
750,A NEST-EGG,looked to the writer of this sketch one week ago--
751,A NEST-EGG,"so individual it seemed--so liberal, and yet so"
752,A NEST-EGG,"independent.  It wasn't even weather-boarded, but,"
753,A NEST-EGG,"instead, was covered smoothly with cement,"
754,A NEST-EGG,as though the plasterers had come while the folks
755,A NEST-EGG,"were visiting, and so, unable to get at the interior,"
756,A NEST-EGG,had just plastered the outside.
757,A NEST-EGG,
758,A NEST-EGG,"I am more than glad that I was hungry enough,"
759,A NEST-EGG,"and weary enough, and wise enough to take the"
760,A NEST-EGG,"house at its first suggestion; for, putting away my"
761,A NEST-EGG,"fishing-tackle for the morning, at least, I went up"
762,A NEST-EGG,"the sloping bank, crossed the dusty road, and"
763,A NEST-EGG,confidently clambered over the fence.
764,A NEST-EGG,
765,A NEST-EGG,Not even a growling dog to intimate that I was
766,A NEST-EGG,trespassing.  All was open--gracious-looking--pastoral.
767,A NEST-EGG,The sward beneath my feet was velvet-like
768,A NEST-EGG,"in elasticity, and the scarce visible path I followed"
769,A NEST-EGG,through it led promptly to the open kitchen door.
770,A NEST-EGG,From within I heard a woman singing some old
771,A NEST-EGG,"ballad in an undertone, while at the threshold a"
772,A NEST-EGG,"trim, white-spurred rooster stood poised on one foot,"
773,A NEST-EGG,curving his glossy neck and cocking his wattled
774,A NEST-EGG,head as though to catch the meaning of the words.
775,A NEST-EGG,I paused.  It was a scene I felt restrained from
776,A NEST-EGG,"breaking in upon, nor would I have, but for the"
777,A NEST-EGG,sound of a strong male voice coming around the
778,A NEST-EGG,corner of the house:
779,A NEST-EGG,
780,A NEST-EGG,"""Sir.  Howdy!"""
781,A NEST-EGG,
782,A NEST-EGG,"Turning, I saw a rough-looking but kindly"
783,A NEST-EGG,"featured man of sixty-five, evidently the owner of the"
784,A NEST-EGG,place.
785,A NEST-EGG,
786,A NEST-EGG,I returned his salutation with some confusion
787,A NEST-EGG,"and much deference.  ""I must really beg your pardon"
788,A NEST-EGG,"for this intrusion,"" I began, ""but I have been"
789,A NEST-EGG,"tiring myself out fishing, and your home here looked"
790,A NEST-EGG,"so pleasant--and I felt so thirsty--and--"""
791,A NEST-EGG,
792,A NEST-EGG,"""Want a drink, I reckon,"" said the old man,"
793,A NEST-EGG,"turning abruptly toward the kitchen door, then pausing"
794,A NEST-EGG,"as suddenly, with a backward motion of his thumb"
795,A NEST-EGG,"--""jest follow the path here down to the little"
796,A NEST-EGG,brick--that's the spring--and you'll find 'at you've
797,A NEST-EGG,come to the right place fer drinkin'-worter!  Hold
798,A NEST-EGG,on a minute tel I get you a tumbler--there's nothin'
799,A NEST-EGG,"down there but a tin."""
800,A NEST-EGG,
801,A NEST-EGG,"""Then don't trouble yourself any further,"" I"
802,A NEST-EGG,"said, heartily, ""for I'd rather drink from a tin cup"
803,A NEST-EGG,"than a goblet of pure gold."""
804,A NEST-EGG,
805,A NEST-EGG,"""And so'd I,"" said the old man, reflectively,"
806,A NEST-EGG,"turning mechanically, and following me down the path."
807,A NEST-EGG,""" 'Druther drink out of a tin--er jest a fruit-can"
808,A NEST-EGG,"with the top knocked off--er--er--er a gourd,"" he"
809,A NEST-EGG,"added in a zestful, reminiscent tone of voice, that"
810,A NEST-EGG,so heightened my impatient thirst that I reached
811,A NEST-EGG,the spring-house fairly in a run.
812,A NEST-EGG,
813,A NEST-EGG,"""Well-sir!"" exclaimed my host, in evident"
814,A NEST-EGG,"delight, as I stood dipping my nose in the second"
815,A NEST-EGG,"cupful of the cool, revivifying liquid, and peering in a"
816,A NEST-EGG,congratulatory kind of way at the blurred and rubicund
817,A NEST-EGG,reflection of my features in the bottom of the
818,A NEST-EGG,"cup, ""well-sir, blame-don! ef it don't do a feller"
819,A NEST-EGG,good to see you enjoyin' of it thataway!  But don't
820,A NEST-EGG,you drink too much o' the worter!--'cause there's
821,A NEST-EGG,"some sweet milk over there in one o' them crocks,"
822,A NEST-EGG,"maybe; and ef you'll jest, kind o' keerful-like, lift"
823,A NEST-EGG,"off the led of that third one, say, over there to"
824,A NEST-EGG,"yer left, and dip you out a tinful er two o' that,"
825,A NEST-EGG,"w'y, it'll do you good to drink it, and it'll do me"
826,A NEST-EGG,"good to see you at it--  But hold up!--hold up!"""
827,A NEST-EGG,"he called, abruptly, as, nowise loath, I bent above"
828,A NEST-EGG,"the vessel designated.  ""Hold yer hosses fer a second!"
829,A NEST-EGG,"Here's Marthy; let her git it fer ye."""
830,A NEST-EGG,
831,A NEST-EGG,"If I was at first surprised and confused, meeting"
832,A NEST-EGG,"the master of the house, I was wholly startled and"
833,A NEST-EGG,chagrined in my present position before its mistress.
834,A NEST-EGG,"But as I arose, and stammered, in my confusion,"
835,A NEST-EGG,"some incoherent apology, I was again reassured and"
836,A NEST-EGG,put at greater ease by the comprehensive and
837,A NEST-EGG,"forgiving smile the woman gave me, as I yielded her"
838,A NEST-EGG,"my place, and, with lifted hat, awaited her further"
839,A NEST-EGG,kindness.
840,A NEST-EGG,
841,A NEST-EGG,"""I came just in time, sir,"" she said, half"
842,A NEST-EGG,"laughingly, as with strong, bare arms she reached across"
843,A NEST-EGG,the gurgling trough and replaced the lid that I had
844,A NEST-EGG,"partially removed.--""I came just in time, I see, to"
845,A NEST-EGG,prevent father from having you dip into the morning's-
846,A NEST-EGG,"milk, which, of course, has scarcely a veil of"
847,A NEST-EGG,"cream over the face of it as yet.  But men, as you"
848,A NEST-EGG,"are doubtless willing to admit,"" she went on jocularly,"
849,A NEST-EGG,"""don't know about these things.  You must"
850,A NEST-EGG,"pardon father, as much for his well-meaning ignorance"
851,A NEST-EGG,"of such matters, as for this cup of cream,"
852,A NEST-EGG,"which I am sure you will better relish."""
853,A NEST-EGG,
854,A NEST-EGG,"She arose, still smiling, with her eyes turned"
855,A NEST-EGG,frankly on my own.  And I must be excused when
856,A NEST-EGG,"I confess that as I bowed my thanks, taking the"
857,A NEST-EGG,"proffered cup and lifting it to my lips, I stared"
858,A NEST-EGG,with an uncommon interest and pleasure at the
859,A NEST-EGG,donor's face.
860,A NEST-EGG,
861,A NEST-EGG,She was a woman of certainly not less than forty
862,A NEST-EGG,"years of age.  But the figure, and the rounded grace"
863,A NEST-EGG,"and fulness of it, together with the features and the"
864,A NEST-EGG,"eyes, completed as fine a specimen of physical and"
865,A NEST-EGG,mental health as ever it has been my fortune to
866,A NEST-EGG,meet; there was something so full of purpose and
867,A NEST-EGG,"resolve--something so wholesome, too, about the"
868,A NEST-EGG,character--something so womanly--I might almost
869,A NEST-EGG,"say manly, and would, but for the petty prejudice"
870,A NEST-EGG,maybe occasioned by the trivial fact of a locket
871,A NEST-EGG,having dropped from her bosom as she knelt; and
872,A NEST-EGG,that trinket still dangles in my memory even as it
873,A NEST-EGG,then dangled and dropped back to its concealment
874,A NEST-EGG,"in her breast as she arose.  But her face, by no"
875,A NEST-EGG,"means handsome in the common sense of the word,"
876,A NEST-EGG,was marked with a breadth and strength of outline
877,A NEST-EGG,and expression that approached the heroic--a face
878,A NEST-EGG,that once seen is forever fixed in memory--a personage
879,A NEST-EGG,once met one must know more of.  And so it
880,A NEST-EGG,"was, that an hour later, as I strolled with the old"
881,A NEST-EGG,"man about his farm, looking, to all intents, with the"
882,A NEST-EGG,"profoundest interest at his Devonshires, Shorthorns,"
883,A NEST-EGG,"Jerseys, and the like, I lured from him something"
884,A NEST-EGG,of an outline of his daughter's history.
885,A NEST-EGG,
886,A NEST-EGG,"""There're no better girl 'n Marthy!"" he said,"
887,A NEST-EGG,mechanically answering some ingenious allusion to
888,A NEST-EGG,"her worth.  ""And yit,"" he went on reflectively,"
889,A NEST-EGG,stooping from his seat in the barn door and with
890,A NEST-EGG,his open jack-knife picking up a little chip with the
891,A NEST-EGG,"point of the blade--""and yit--you wouldn't believe"
892,A NEST-EGG,"it--but Marthy was the oldest o' three daughters,"
893,A NEST-EGG,and hed--I may say--hed more advantages o' marryin'--
894,A NEST-EGG,"and yit, as I was jest goin' to say, she's the"
895,A NEST-EGG,very one 'at didn't marry.  Hed every advantage--
896,A NEST-EGG,"Marthy did.  W'y, we even hed her educated--her"
897,A NEST-EGG,mother was a-livin' then--and we was well enough
898,A NEST-EGG,"fixed to afford the educatin' of her, mother allus"
899,A NEST-EGG,"contended--and we was--besides, it was Marthy's"
900,A NEST-EGG,"notion, too, and you know how women is thataway"
901,A NEST-EGG,when they git their head set.  So we sent Marthy
902,A NEST-EGG,"down to Indianop'lus, and got her books and put"
903,A NEST-EGG,"her in school there, and paid fer her keepin' and"
904,A NEST-EGG,"ever'thing; and she jest--well, you may say, lived"
905,A NEST-EGG,there stiddy fer better'n four year.  O' course
906,A NEST-EGG,"she'd git back ever' once-an-a-while, but her visits"
907,A NEST-EGG,"was allus, some-way-another, onsatisfactory-like,"
908,A NEST-EGG,"'cause, you see, Marthy was allus my favorite, and"
909,A NEST-EGG,I'd allus laughed and told her 'at the other girls
910,A NEST-EGG,"could git marrid ef they wanted, but SHE was goin'"
911,A NEST-EGG,"to be the 'nest-egg' of our family, and 'slong as I"
912,A NEST-EGG,lived I wanted her at home with me.  And she'd
913,A NEST-EGG,laugh and contend 'at she'd as li'f be an old maid as
914,A NEST-EGG,"not, and never expected to marry, ner didn't want"
915,A NEST-EGG,to.
916,A NEST-EGG,
917,A NEST-EGG,"""But she had me sceart onc't, though!  Come"
918,A NEST-EGG,"out from the city one time, durin' the army, with"
919,A NEST-EGG,a peart-lookin' young feller in blue clothes and gilt
920,A NEST-EGG,straps on his shoulders.  Young lieutenant he was
921,A NEST-EGG,--name o' Morris.  Was layin' in camp there in the
922,A NEST-EGG,city som'er's.  I disremember which camp it was
923,A NEST-EGG,"now adzackly--but anyway, it 'peared like he had"
924,A NEST-EGG,"plenty o' time to go and come, fer from that time"
925,A NEST-EGG,on he kep' on a-comin'--ever' time Marthy 'ud
926,A NEST-EGG,"come home, he'd come, too; and I got to noticin' 'at"
927,A NEST-EGG,Marthy come home a good 'eal more'n she used to
928,A NEST-EGG,afore Morris first brought her.  And blame' ef the
929,A NEST-EGG,thing didn't git to worryin' me!  And onc't I spoke
930,A NEST-EGG,"to mother about it, and told her ef I thought the"
931,A NEST-EGG,feller wanted to marry Marthy I'd jest stop his
932,A NEST-EGG,comin' right then and there.  But mother she sort o'
933,A NEST-EGG,smiled and said somepin' 'bout men a-never seein'
934,A NEST-EGG,"through nothin'; and when I ast her what she meant,"
935,A NEST-EGG,"w'y, she ups and tells me 'at Morris didn't keer"
936,A NEST-EGG,"nothin' fer Marthy, ner Marthy fer Morris, and"
937,A NEST-EGG,then went on to tell me that Morris was kind o'
938,A NEST-EGG,"aidgin' up to'rds Annie--she was next to Marthy,"
939,A NEST-EGG,"you know, in p'int of years and experience, but"
940,A NEST-EGG,ever'body allus said 'at Annie was the purtiest one
941,A NEST-EGG,o' the whole three of 'em.  And so when mother
942,A NEST-EGG,"told me 'at the signs p'inted to'rds Annie, w'y, of course, I"
943,A NEST-EGG,"hedn't no particular objections to that,"
944,A NEST-EGG,'cause Morris was of good fambly enough it turned
945,A NEST-EGG,"out, and, in fact, was as stirrin' a young feller as"
946,A NEST-EGG,"ever I' want fer a son-in-law, and so I hed nothin'"
947,A NEST-EGG,more to say--ner they wasn't no occasion to say
948,A NEST-EGG,"nothin', 'cause right along about then I begin to"
949,A NEST-EGG,"notice 'at Marthy quit comin' home so much, and"
950,A NEST-EGG,Morris kep' a-comin' more.
951,A NEST-EGG,
952,A NEST-EGG,"""Tel finally, one time he was out here all by"
953,A NEST-EGG,"hisself, 'long about dusk, come out here where"

955,A NEST-EGG,"a straightfor'ard way, ef he couldn't marry"
956,A NEST-EGG,"Annie; and, some-way-another, blame' ef it didn't"
957,A NEST-EGG,make me happy as him when I told him yes!
958,A NEST-EGG,"You see that thing proved, pine-blank, 'at he wasn't"
959,A NEST-EGG,"a-fishin' round fer Marthy.  Well-sir, as luck would"
960,A NEST-EGG,"hev it, Marthy got home about a half-hour later,"
961,A NEST-EGG,and I'll give you my word I was never so glad to
962,A NEST-EGG,"see the girl in my life!  It was foolish in me, I"
963,A NEST-EGG,"reckon, but when I see her drivin' up the lane--"
964,A NEST-EGG,"it was purt' nigh dark then, but I could see her"
965,A NEST-EGG,through the open winder from where I was sittin'
966,A NEST-EGG,"at the supper-table, and so I jest quietly excused"
967,A NEST-EGG,"myself, p'lite-like, as a feller will, you know, when"
968,A NEST-EGG,"they's comp'ny round, and slipped off and met her"

2147,THE OLD MAN,"rapt and far-off gazings of the eyes of both, why,"
2148,THE OLD MAN,but for the silver tinsel of the beard of one and the

2152,THE OLD MAN,"With such a view of age, one feels like whipping"

2158,THE OLD MAN,Who ever saw a man so old as not secretly and most

2162,THE OLD MAN,"shock, and no selfish hearts still to yearn after him"
2163,THE OLD MAN,"and grieve on unconsoled?  Why, even in the slow"
2164,THE OLD MAN,declining years of old Methuselah--the banner old

2168,THE OLD MAN,"abrupt to his immediate friends, and a blow to the"

2182,THE OLD MAN,And with what unerring gift of prophecy

2184,THE OLD MAN,"of summer--the gracious rains, at last,--the"
2185,THE OLD MAN,milk-sick breeding autumn and the blighting

2188,THE OLD MAN,"And, having annually frosted his feet for some"

2192,THE OLD MAN,coming of the then fledgling cyclone and the gosling

2195,THE OLD MAN,wonderment and awe must old chronic maladies
2196,THE OLD MAN,have regarded him--tackling him singly or in solid
2197,THE OLD MAN,"phalanx, only to drop back pantingly, at last, and"
2198,THE OLD MAN,slink away dumfounded and abashed!  And with
2199,THE OLD MAN,what brazen pride the final conquering disease must

2211,THE OLD MAN,warmer affections of the children.  The old man
2212,THE OLD MAN,from the country--you are always glad to see him

2215,THE OLD MAN,"thickets in everything he says, and dashes of shadow"
2216,THE OLD MAN,and sunshine over the waving wheat are in all the
2217,THE OLD MAN,varying expressions of his swarthy face.  The grip
2218,THE OLD MAN,"of his hand is a thing to bet on, and the undue"
2219,THE OLD MAN,loudness of his voice in greeting you is even lulling

2222,THE OLD MAN,"Very probably you are forced to smile, meeting the"

2239,THE OLD MAN,"And, with the heartiest sort of a laugh, the old man"

2246,THE OLD MAN,inundated town in the Ohio valley.  There was much
2247,THE OLD MAN,"of the pathetic in his experience, but the bravery"
2248,THE OLD MAN,with which he bore his misfortunes was admirable.
2249,THE OLD MAN,A year ago his little home was first invaded by the
2250,THE OLD MAN,"flood, and himself and wife, and his son's family,"
2251,THE OLD MAN,were driven from it to the hills for safety--but the
2252,THE OLD MAN,old man's telling of the story can not be improved
2253,THE OLD MAN,"upon.  It ran like this:  ""Last year, ven I svwim out"
2254,THE OLD MAN,"fon dot leedle home off mine, mit my vife, unt my"
2255,THE OLD MAN,"son, his vife unt leedle girls, I dink dot's der last"
2256,THE OLD MAN,time goot-by to dose proberty!  But afder der vater
2257,THE OLD MAN,"is gone down, unt dry oop unt eberding, dere vas"
2258,THE OLD MAN,"yet der house dere.  Unt my friends dey sait, 'Dot's"
2259,THE OLD MAN,"all you got yet.--Vell, feex oop der house--dot's"
2260,THE OLD MAN,"someding! feex oop der house, unt you vood still"
2261,THE OLD MAN,"hatt yet a home!'  Vell, all summer I go to work,"
2262,THE OLD MAN,unt spent me eberding unt feex der proberty.  Den
2263,THE OLD MAN,I got yet a morgage on der house!  Dees time here
2264,THE OLD MAN,der vater come again--till I vish it vas last year
2265,THE OLD MAN,"vonce!  Unt now all I safe is my vife, unt my son"
2266,THE OLD MAN,"his vife, unt my leedle grandchilderns!  Else"
2267,THE OLD MAN,everding is gone!  All--everyding!--Der house gone--unt--unt--der
2268,THE OLD MAN,"morgage gone, too!""  And then the"
2269,THE OLD MAN,"old Teutonic face ""melted all over in sunshiny"
2270,THE OLD MAN,"smiles,"" and, turning, he bent and lifted a sleepy"
2271,THE OLD MAN,little girl from a pile of dirty bundles in the depot
2272,THE OLD MAN,waiting-room and went pacing up and down the
2273,THE OLD MAN,"muddy floor, saying things in German to the child."
2274,THE OLD MAN,I thought the whole thing rather beautiful.  That's
2275,THE OLD MAN,"the kind of an old man who, saying good-by to"
2276,THE OLD MAN,"his son, would lean and kiss the young man's hand,"
2277,THE OLD MAN,"as in the Dutch regions of Pennsylvania, two or"
2278,THE OLD MAN,"three weeks ago, I saw an old man do."
2279,THE OLD MAN,
2280,THE OLD MAN,Mark Lemon must have known intimately and
2281,THE OLD MAN,loved the genteel old man of the city when the once
2282,THE OLD MAN,"famous domestic drama of ""Grandfather Whitehead"""
2283,THE OLD MAN,was conceived.  In the play the old man--a
2284,THE OLD MAN,once prosperous merchant--finds a happy home in
2285,THE OLD MAN,the household of his son-in-law.  And here it is
2286,THE OLD MAN,"that the gentle author has drawn at once the poem,"
2287,THE OLD MAN,"the picture, and the living proof of the old"
2288,THE OLD MAN,"Wordsworthian axiom, ""The child is father to the man."""
2289,THE OLD MAN,"The old man, in his simple way, and in his great"
2290,THE OLD MAN,"love for his wilful little grandchild, is being"
2291,THE OLD MAN,continually distracted from the grave sermons and
2292,THE OLD MAN,"moral lessons he would read the boy.  As, for"
2293,THE OLD MAN,"instance, aggrievedly attacking the little fellow's"
2294,THE OLD MAN,neglect of his books and his inordinate tendency
2295,THE OLD MAN,"toward idleness and play--the culprit, in the meantime,"
2296,THE OLD MAN,down on the floor clumsily winding his top--
2297,THE OLD MAN,the old man runs on something in this wise:
2298,THE OLD MAN,
2299,THE OLD MAN,"""Play! play! play!  Always play and no work, no"
2300,THE OLD MAN,"study, no lessons.  And here you are, the only child"
2301,THE OLD MAN,of the most indulgent parents in the world--parents
2302,THE OLD MAN,"that, proud as they are of you, would be ten times"
2303,THE OLD MAN,"prouder only to see you at your book, storing"
2304,THE OLD MAN,"your mind with useful knowledge, instead of, day"
2305,THE OLD MAN,"in, day out, frittering away your time over your"
2306,THE OLD MAN,toys and your tops and marbles.  And even when
2307,THE OLD MAN,your old grandfather tries to advise you and wants
2308,THE OLD MAN,"to help you, and is always ready and eager to assist"
2309,THE OLD MAN,"you, and all--why, what's it all amount to?  Coax"
2310,THE OLD MAN,"and beg and tease and plead with you, and yet--and"
2311,THE OLD MAN,"yet""--  (Mechanically kneeling as he speaks)--"
2312,THE OLD MAN,"""Now that's not the way to wind your top!  How"
2313,THE OLD MAN,"many more times will I have to show you!""  And"
2314,THE OLD MAN,an instant later the old man's admonitions are
2315,THE OLD MAN,"entirely forgotten, and his artless nature--dull now to"
2316,THE OLD MAN,everything but the childish glee in which he shares--
2317,THE OLD MAN,is all the sweeter and more lovable for its simplicity.
2318,THE OLD MAN,
2319,THE OLD MAN,"And so it is, Old Man, that you are always"
2320,THE OLD MAN,touching the very tenderest places in our hearts--
2321,THE OLD MAN,"unconsciously appealing to our warmest sympathies,"
2322,THE OLD MAN,and taking to yourself our purest love.  We look
2323,THE OLD MAN,"upon your drooping figure, and we mark your tottering"
2324,THE OLD MAN,"step and trembling hand, yet a reliant something"
2325,THE OLD MAN,"in your face forbids compassion, and a something"
2326,THE OLD MAN,in your eye will not permit us to look sorrowfully
2327,THE OLD MAN,"on you.  And, however we may smile at your"
2328,THE OLD MAN,quaint ways and old-school oddities of manner and
2329,THE OLD MAN,"of speech, our merriment is ever tempered with the"
2330,THE OLD MAN,gentlest reverence.
2331,THE OLD MAN,

2334,THE GILDED ROLL,THE GILDED ROLL
2335,THE GILDED ROLL,
2336,THE GILDED ROLL,"Nosing around in an old box--packed away,"
2337,THE GILDED ROLL,and lost to memory for years--an hour ago
2338,THE GILDED ROLL,"I found a musty package of gilt paper, or rather,"
2339,THE GILDED ROLL,"a roll it was, with the green-tarnished gold of the"
2340,THE GILDED ROLL,old sheet for the outer wrapper.  I picked it up
2341,THE GILDED ROLL,"mechanically to toss it into some obscure corner,"
2342,THE GILDED ROLL,"when, carelessly lifting it by one end, a child's tin"
2343,THE GILDED ROLL,whistle dropped therefrom and fell tinkling on the
2344,THE GILDED ROLL,attic floor.  It lies before me on my writing table
2345,THE GILDED ROLL,"now--and so, too, does the roll entire, though now"
2346,THE GILDED ROLL,"a roll no longer,--for my eager fingers have unrolled"
2347,THE GILDED ROLL,"the gilded covering, and all its precious contents"
2348,THE GILDED ROLL,are spread out beneath my hungry eyes.
2349,THE GILDED ROLL,
2350,THE GILDED ROLL,Here is a scroll of ink-written music.  I don't
2351,THE GILDED ROLL,"read music, but I know the dash and swing of the"
2352,THE GILDED ROLL,"pen that rained it on the page.  Here is a letter,"
2353,THE GILDED ROLL,with the selfsame impulse and abandon in every
2354,THE GILDED ROLL,syllable; and its melody--however sweet the other
2355,THE GILDED ROLL,--is far more sweet to me.  And here are other
2356,THE GILDED ROLL,"letters like it--three--five--and seven, at least.  Bob"
2357,THE GILDED ROLL,"wrote them from the front, and Billy kept them"
2358,THE GILDED ROLL,for me when I went to join him.  Dear boy!  Dear
2359,THE GILDED ROLL,boy!
2360,THE GILDED ROLL,
2361,THE GILDED ROLL,Here are some cards of bristol-board.  Ah! when
2362,THE GILDED ROLL,Bob came to these there were no blotches then.
2363,THE GILDED ROLL,"What faces--what expressions!  The droll, ridiculous,"
2364,THE GILDED ROLL,"good-for-nothing genius, with his ""sad mouth,"""
2365,THE GILDED ROLL,"as he called it, ""upside down,"" laughing always--"
2366,THE GILDED ROLL,"at everything, at big rallies, and mass-meetings and"
2367,THE GILDED ROLL,"conventions, county fairs, and floral halls, booths,"
2368,THE GILDED ROLL,"watermelon-wagons, dancing-tents, the swing, the"
2369,THE GILDED ROLL,"Daguerrean-car, the ""lung-barometer,"" and the air-"
2370,THE GILDED ROLL,"gun man.  Oh! what a gifted, good-for-nothing boy"
2371,THE GILDED ROLL,Bob was in those old days!  And here's a picture
2372,THE GILDED ROLL,of a girlish face--a very faded photograph--even
2373,THE GILDED ROLL,"fresh from ""the gallery,"" five and twenty years ago,"
2374,THE GILDED ROLL,it was a faded thing.  But the living face--how
2375,THE GILDED ROLL,"bright and clear that was!--for ""Doc,"" Bob's awful"
2376,THE GILDED ROLL,"name for her, was a pretty girl, and brilliant, clever,"
2377,THE GILDED ROLL,lovable every way.  No wonder Bob fancied her!
2378,THE GILDED ROLL,And you could see some hint of her jaunty loveliness
2379,THE GILDED ROLL,"in every fairy face he drew, and you could"
2380,THE GILDED ROLL,find her happy ways and dainty tastes unconsciously
2381,THE GILDED ROLL,assumed in all he did--the books he read--the
2382,THE GILDED ROLL,"poems he admired, and those he wrote; and, ringing"
2383,THE GILDED ROLL,"clear and pure and jubilant, the vibrant beauty"
2384,THE GILDED ROLL,of her voice could clearly be defined and traced
2385,THE GILDED ROLL,"through all his music.  Now, there's the happy pair"
2386,THE GILDED ROLL,of them--Bob and Doc.  Make of them just whatever
2387,THE GILDED ROLL,"your good fancy may dictate, but keep in mind"
2388,THE GILDED ROLL,"the stern, relentless ways of destiny."
2389,THE GILDED ROLL,
2390,THE GILDED ROLL,"You are not at the beginning of a novel, only at"
2391,THE GILDED ROLL,the threshold of one of a hundred experiences that
2392,THE GILDED ROLL,"lie buried in the past, and this particular one most"
2393,THE GILDED ROLL,happily resurrected by these odds and ends found
2394,THE GILDED ROLL,in the gilded roll.
2395,THE GILDED ROLL,
2396,THE GILDED ROLL,"You see, dating away back, the contents of this"
2397,THE GILDED ROLL,"package, mainly, were hastily gathered together"
2398,THE GILDED ROLL,after a week's visit out at the old Mills farm; the
2399,THE GILDED ROLL,"gilt paper, and the whistle, and the pictures, they"
2400,THE GILDED ROLL,"were Billy's; the music pages, Bob's, or Doc's; the"
2401,THE GILDED ROLL,letters and some other manuscripts were mine.
2402,THE GILDED ROLL,
2403,THE GILDED ROLL,"The Mills girls were great friends of Doc's, and"
2404,THE GILDED ROLL,often came to visit her in town; and so Doc often
2405,THE GILDED ROLL,visited the Mills's.  This is the way that Bob first
2406,THE GILDED ROLL,"got out there, and won them all, and ""shaped the"
2407,THE GILDED ROLL,"thing"" for me, as he would put it; and lastly, we"
2408,THE GILDED ROLL,"had lugged in Billy,--such a handy boy, you know,"
2409,THE GILDED ROLL,"to hold the horses on picnic excursions, and to"
2410,THE GILDED ROLL,"watch the carriage and the luncheon, and all that.--"
2411,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Yes, and,"" Bob would say, ""such a serviceable"
2412,THE GILDED ROLL,"boy in getting all the fishing tackle in proper order,"
2413,THE GILDED ROLL,"and digging bait, and promenading in our wake up"
2414,THE GILDED ROLL,"and down the creek all day, with the minnow-"
2415,THE GILDED ROLL,"bucket hanging on his arm, don't you know!"""
2416,THE GILDED ROLL,
2417,THE GILDED ROLL,"But jolly as the days were, I think jollier were"
2418,THE GILDED ROLL,the long evenings at the farm.  After the supper in
2419,THE GILDED ROLL,"the grove, where, when the weather permitted,"
2420,THE GILDED ROLL,always stood the table ankle-deep in the cool green
2421,THE GILDED ROLL,plush of the sward; and after the lounge upon the
2422,THE GILDED ROLL,"grass, and the cigars, and the new fish stories, and"
2423,THE GILDED ROLL,"the general invoice of the old ones, it was delectable"
2424,THE GILDED ROLL,"to get back to the girls again, and in the old"
2425,THE GILDED ROLL,"""best room"" hear once more the lilt of the old"
2426,THE GILDED ROLL,songs and the staccatoed laughter of the piano
2427,THE GILDED ROLL,mingling with the alto and falsetto voices of the Mills
2428,THE GILDED ROLL,"girls, and the gallant soprano of the dear girl Doc."
2429,THE GILDED ROLL,
2430,THE GILDED ROLL,"This is the scene I want you to look in upon,"
2431,THE GILDED ROLL,"as, in fancy, I do now--and here are the materials"
2432,THE GILDED ROLL,"for it all, husked from the gilded roll:"
2433,THE GILDED ROLL,
2434,THE GILDED ROLL,"Bob, the master, leans at the piano now, and Doc"
2435,THE GILDED ROLL,"is at the keys, her glad face often thrown up side-"
2436,THE GILDED ROLL,wise toward his own.  His face is boyish--for there
2437,THE GILDED ROLL,is yet but the ghost of a mustache upon his lip.
2438,THE GILDED ROLL,"His eyes are dark and clear, of over-size when looking"
2439,THE GILDED ROLL,"at you, but now their lids are drooped above"
2440,THE GILDED ROLL,"his violin, whose melody has, for the time, almost"
2441,THE GILDED ROLL,smoothed away the upward kinkings of the corners
2442,THE GILDED ROLL,of his mouth.  And wonderfully quiet now
2443,THE GILDED ROLL,"is every one, and the chords of the piano, too, are"
2444,THE GILDED ROLL,"low and faltering; and so, at last, the tune itself"
2445,THE GILDED ROLL,"swoons into the universal hush, and--Bob is rasping,"
2446,THE GILDED ROLL,"in its stead, the ridiculous, but marvelously"
2447,THE GILDED ROLL,"perfect imitation of the ""priming"" of a pump, while"
2448,THE GILDED ROLL,"Billy's hands forget the ""chiggers"" on the bare"
2449,THE GILDED ROLL,"backs of his feet, as, with clapping palms, he dances"
2450,THE GILDED ROLL,round the room in ungovernable spasms of delight.
2451,THE GILDED ROLL,"And then we all laugh; and Billy, taking advantage"
2452,THE GILDED ROLL,"of the general tumult, pulls Bob's head down and"
2453,THE GILDED ROLL,"whispers, ""Git 'em to stay up 'way late to-night!"""
2454,THE GILDED ROLL,"And Bob, perhaps remembering that we go back"
2455,THE GILDED ROLL,"home to-morrow, winks at the little fellow and whispers,"
2456,THE GILDED ROLL,"""You let me manage 'em!  Stay up till broad"
2457,THE GILDED ROLL,"daylight if we take a notion--eh?""  And Billy"
2458,THE GILDED ROLL,"dances off again in newer glee, while the inspired"
2459,THE GILDED ROLL,musician is plunking a banjo imitation on his
2460,THE GILDED ROLL,"enchanted instrument, which is unceremoniously"
2461,THE GILDED ROLL,drowned out by a circus-tune from Doc that is
2462,THE GILDED ROLL,absolutely inspiring to every one but the barefooted
2463,THE GILDED ROLL,"brother, who drops back listlessly to his old position"
2464,THE GILDED ROLL,on the floor and sullenly renews operations on
2465,THE GILDED ROLL,"his ""chigger"" claims."
2466,THE GILDED ROLL,
2467,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Thought you was goin' to have pop-corn to-night"
2468,THE GILDED ROLL,"all so fast!"" he says, doggedly, in the midst of a"
2469,THE GILDED ROLL,momentary lull that has fallen on a game of whist.
2470,THE GILDED ROLL,"And then the oldest Mills girl, who thinks cards stupid"
2471,THE GILDED ROLL,"anyhow, says:  ""That's so, Billy; and we're going"
2472,THE GILDED ROLL,"to have it, too; and right away, for this game's"
2473,THE GILDED ROLL,"just ending, and I shan't submit to being bored with"
2474,THE GILDED ROLL,another.  I say 'pop-corn' with Billy!  And after
2475,THE GILDED ROLL,"that,"" she continues, rising and addressing the party"
2476,THE GILDED ROLL,"in general, ""we must have another literary and"
2477,THE GILDED ROLL,"artistic tournament, and that's been in contemplation"
2478,THE GILDED ROLL,and preparation long enough; so you gentlemen can
2479,THE GILDED ROLL,"be pulling your wits together for the exercises, while"
2480,THE GILDED ROLL,"us girls see to the refreshments."""
2481,THE GILDED ROLL,
2482,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Have you done anything toward it!"" queries"
2483,THE GILDED ROLL,"Bob, when the girls are gone, with the alert Billy in"
2484,THE GILDED ROLL,their wake.
2485,THE GILDED ROLL,
2486,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Just an outline,"" I reply.  ""How with you?"""
2487,THE GILDED ROLL,
2488,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Clean forgot it--that is, the preparation; but I've"
2489,THE GILDED ROLL,"got a little old second-hand idea, if you'll all help me"
2490,THE GILDED ROLL,"out with it, that'll amuse us some, and tickle Billy,"
2491,THE GILDED ROLL,"I'm certain."""
2492,THE GILDED ROLL,
2493,THE GILDED ROLL,So that's agreed upon; and while Bob produces
2494,THE GILDED ROLL,"his portfolio, drawing paper, pencils and so on, I"
2495,THE GILDED ROLL,turn to my note-book in a dazed way and begin
2496,THE GILDED ROLL,"counting my fingers in a depth of profound abstraction,"
2497,THE GILDED ROLL,from which I am barely aroused by the reappearance
2498,THE GILDED ROLL,of the girls and Billy.
2499,THE GILDED ROLL,
2500,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Goody, goody, goody!  Bob's goin' to make"
2501,THE GILDED ROLL,"pictures!"" cries Billy, in additional transport to that"
2502,THE GILDED ROLL,the cake pop-corn had produced.
2503,THE GILDED ROLL,
2504,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Now, you girls,"" says Bob, gently detaching the"
2505,THE GILDED ROLL,affectionate Billy from one leg and moving a chair
2506,THE GILDED ROLL,"to the table, with a backward glance of intelligence"
2507,THE GILDED ROLL,"toward the boy,--""you girls are to help us all you"
2508,THE GILDED ROLL,"can, and we can all work; but, as I'll have all the"
2509,THE GILDED ROLL,"illustrations to do, I want you to do as many of"
2510,THE GILDED ROLL,"the verses as you can--that'll be easy, you know,--"
2511,THE GILDED ROLL,because the work entire is just to consist of a series
2512,THE GILDED ROLL,"of fool-epigrams, such as, for instance,--listen,"
2513,THE GILDED ROLL,Billy:
2514,THE GILDED ROLL,
2515,THE GILDED ROLL,Here lies a young man
2516,THE GILDED ROLL,Who in childhood began
2517,THE GILDED ROLL,"To swear, and to smoke, and to drink,--"
2518,THE GILDED ROLL,In his twentieth year
2519,THE GILDED ROLL,"He quit swearing and beer,"
2520,THE GILDED ROLL,"And yet is still smoking, I think."""
2521,THE GILDED ROLL,
2522,THE GILDED ROLL,
2523,THE GILDED ROLL,And the rest of his instructions are delivered in
2524,THE GILDED ROLL,"lower tones, that the boy may not hear; and then, all"
2525,THE GILDED ROLL,"matters seemingly arranged, he turns to the boy with"
2526,THE GILDED ROLL,"--""And now, Billy, no lookin' over shoulders, you"
2527,THE GILDED ROLL,"know, or swinging on my chair-back while I'm at"
2528,THE GILDED ROLL,"work.  When the pictures are all finished, then you"
2529,THE GILDED ROLL,"can take a squint at 'em, and not before.  Is that all"
2530,THE GILDED ROLL,"hunky, now?"""
2531,THE GILDED ROLL,
2532,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Oh! who's a-goin' to look over your shoulder--"
2533,THE GILDED ROLL,"only DOC.""  And as the radiant Doc hastily quits"
2534,THE GILDED ROLL,"that very post, and dives for the offending brother,"
2535,THE GILDED ROLL,he scrambles under the piano and laughs derisively.
2536,THE GILDED ROLL,
2537,THE GILDED ROLL,And then a silence falls upon the group--a
2538,THE GILDED ROLL,"gracious quiet, only intruded upon by the very juicy"
2539,THE GILDED ROLL,and exuberant munching of an apple from a remote
2540,THE GILDED ROLL,"fastness of the room, and the occasional thumping"
2541,THE GILDED ROLL,of a bare heel against the floor.
2542,THE GILDED ROLL,
2543,THE GILDED ROLL,At last I close my note-book with a half slam.
2544,THE GILDED ROLL,
2545,THE GILDED ROLL,"""That means,"" says Bob, laying down his pencil,"
2546,THE GILDED ROLL,"and addressing the girls,--""that means he's"
2547,THE GILDED ROLL,"concluded his poem, and that he's not pleased with it"
2548,THE GILDED ROLL,"in any manner, and that he intends declining to read"
2549,THE GILDED ROLL,"it, for that self-acknowledged reason, and that he"
2550,THE GILDED ROLL,expects us to believe every affected word of his
2551,THE GILDED ROLL,"entire speech--"""
2552,THE GILDED ROLL,
2553,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Oh, don't!"" I exclaim."
2554,THE GILDED ROLL,
2555,THE GILDED ROLL,"""Then give us the wretched production, in all its"
2556,THE GILDED ROLL,"hideous deformity!"""
2557,THE GILDED ROLL,
2558,THE GILDED ROLL,"And the girls all laugh so sympathetically, and"
2559,THE GILDED ROLL,"Bob joins them so gently, and yet with a tone, I"
2560,THE GILDED ROLL,"know, that can be changed so quickly to my further"
2561,THE GILDED ROLL,"discomfiture, that I arise at once and read, without"
2562,THE GILDED ROLL,"apology or excuse, this primitive and very callow"
2563,THE GILDED ROLL,poem recovered here to-day from the gilded roll:
2564,THE GILDED ROLL,
2565,THE GILDED ROLL,
2566,A BACKWARD LOOK,A BACKWARD LOOK
2567,A BACKWARD LOOK,
2568,A BACKWARD LOOK,"As I sat smoking, alone, yesterday,"
2569,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And lazily leaning back in my chair,"
2570,A BACKWARD LOOK,Enjoying myself in a general way--
2571,A BACKWARD LOOK,Allowing my thoughts a holiday
2572,A BACKWARD LOOK,"From weariness, toil and care,"
2573,A BACKWARD LOOK,"My fancies--doubtless, for ventilation--"
2574,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Left ajar the gates of my mind,--"
2575,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And Memory, seeing the situation"
2576,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Slipped out in the street of ""Auld Lang Syne""--"
2577,A BACKWARD LOOK,
2578,A BACKWARD LOOK,Wandering ever with tireless feet
2579,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Through scenes of silence, and jubilee"
2580,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet
2581,A BACKWARD LOOK,Were thronging the shadowy side of the street
2582,A BACKWARD LOOK,As far as the eye could see;
2583,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Dreaming again, in anticipation,"

2586,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of walking asleep in the world's strange ways.
2587,A BACKWARD LOOK,
2588,A BACKWARD LOOK,Away to the house where I was born!
2589,A BACKWARD LOOK,And there was the selfsame clock that ticked
2590,A BACKWARD LOOK,"From the close of dusk to the burst of morn,"
2591,A BACKWARD LOOK,When life-warm hands plucked the golden corn
2592,A BACKWARD LOOK,And helped when the apples were picked.

2597,A BACKWARD LOOK,
2598,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And down to the swing in the locust-tree,"
2599,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Where the grass was worn from the trampled ground,"

2606,A BACKWARD LOOK,The old ghosts romp through the best days dead!
2607,A BACKWARD LOOK,
2608,A BACKWARD LOOK,And again I gazed from the old schoolroom
2609,A BACKWARD LOOK,"With a wistful look, of a long June day,"

2612,A BACKWARD LOOK,"He had such a ""partial"" way,"
2613,A BACKWARD LOOK,"It seemed, toward me.--And again I thought"
2614,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of a probable likelihood to be

2616,A BACKWARD LOOK,Catching a note from me.
2617,A BACKWARD LOOK,
2618,A BACKWARD LOOK,And down through the woods to the swimming-hole--
2619,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Where the big, white, hollow, old sycamore grows,--"
2620,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And we never cared when the water was cold,"
2621,A BACKWARD LOOK,"And always ""ducked"" the boy that told"
2622,A BACKWARD LOOK,On the fellow that tied the clothes.--
2623,A BACKWARD LOOK,"When life went so like a dreamy rhyme,"
2624,A BACKWARD LOOK,That it seems to me now that then
2625,A BACKWARD LOOK,The world was having a jollier time
2626,A BACKWARD LOOK,Than it ever will have again.

2939,A WILD IRISHMAN,
2940,A WILD IRISHMAN,Not very many years ago the writer was for
2941,A WILD IRISHMAN,"some months stationed at South Bend, a thriving"
2942,A WILD IRISHMAN,little city of northern Indiana.  Its population is
2943,A WILD IRISHMAN,"mainly on the one side of the St. Joseph River, but"
2944,A WILD IRISHMAN,quite a respectable fraction thereof takes its
2945,A WILD IRISHMAN,"industrial way to the opposite shore, and there gains an"
2946,A WILD IRISHMAN,audience and a hearing in the rather imposing
2947,A WILD IRISHMAN,"growth and hurly-burly of its big manufactories,"
2948,A WILD IRISHMAN,and the consequent rapid appearance of multitudinous
2949,A WILD IRISHMAN,"neat cottages, tenement houses and business"
2950,A WILD IRISHMAN,blocks.  A stranger entering South Bend proper on
2951,A WILD IRISHMAN,"any ordinary day, will be at some loss to account for"
2952,A WILD IRISHMAN,its prosperous appearance--its flagged and bouldered
2953,A WILD IRISHMAN,"streets--its handsome mercantile blocks, banks, and"
2954,A WILD IRISHMAN,business houses generally.  Reasoning from cause to
2955,A WILD IRISHMAN,"effect, and seeing but a meager sprinkling of people"
2956,A WILD IRISHMAN,"on the streets throughout the day, and these seeming,"
2957,A WILD IRISHMAN,"for the most part, merely idlers, and in nowise"
2958,A WILD IRISHMAN,accessory to the evident thrift and opulence of their
2959,A WILD IRISHMAN,"surroundings, the observant stranger will be puzzled"
2960,A WILD IRISHMAN,"at the situation.  But when evening comes, and the"
2961,A WILD IRISHMAN,"outlying foundries, sewing-machine, wagon, plow,"
2962,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and other ""works,"" together with the paper-mills and all the"
2963,A WILD IRISHMAN,nameless industries--when the operations
2964,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of all these are suspended for the day, and the"
2965,A WILD IRISHMAN,"workmen and workwomen loosed from labor--then,"
2966,A WILD IRISHMAN,as this vast army suddenly invades and overflows
2967,A WILD IRISHMAN,"bridge, roadway, street and lane, the startled stranger"
2968,A WILD IRISHMAN,will fully comprehend the why and wherefore
2969,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of the city's high prosperity.  And, once acquainted"
2970,A WILD IRISHMAN,"with the people there, the fortunate sojourner will"
2971,A WILD IRISHMAN,"find no ordinary culture and intelligence, and, as"
2972,A WILD IRISHMAN,"certainly, he will meet with a social spirit and a"
2973,A WILD IRISHMAN,whole-souled heartiness that will make the place a
2974,A WILD IRISHMAN,"lasting memory.  The town, too, is the home of"
2975,A WILD IRISHMAN,"many world-known people, and a host of local"
2976,A WILD IRISHMAN,"celebrities, the chief of which latter class I found,"
2977,A WILD IRISHMAN,"during my stay there, in the person of Tommy Stafford,"
2978,A WILD IRISHMAN,"or ""The Wild Irishman"" as everybody called"
2979,A WILD IRISHMAN,him.
2980,A WILD IRISHMAN,
2981,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Talk of odd fellows and eccentric characters,"""
2982,A WILD IRISHMAN,"said Major Blowney, my employer, one afternoon,"
2983,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""you must see our 'Wild Irishman' here before you"
2984,A WILD IRISHMAN,"say you've yet found the queerest, brightest, cleverest"
2985,A WILD IRISHMAN,"chap in all your travels.  What d'ye say,"
2986,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Stockford?""  And the Major paused in his work of"
2987,A WILD IRISHMAN,charging cartridges for his new breech-loading shotgun
2988,A WILD IRISHMAN,and turned to await his partner's response.
2989,A WILD IRISHMAN,
2990,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Stockford, thus addressed, paused above the"
2991,A WILD IRISHMAN,"shield-sign he was lettering, slowly smiling as he"
2992,A WILD IRISHMAN,dipped and trailed his pencil through the ivory black
2993,A WILD IRISHMAN,"upon a bit of broken glass and said, in his deliberate,"
2994,A WILD IRISHMAN,"half absent-minded way,--""Is it Tommy you're telling"
2995,A WILD IRISHMAN,"him about?"" and then, with a gradual broadening"
2996,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of the smile, he went on, ""Well, I should say so."
2997,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Tommy!  What's come of the fellow, anyway?  I"
2998,A WILD IRISHMAN,"haven't seen him since his last bout with the mayor,"
2999,A WILD IRISHMAN,"on his trial for shakin' up that fast-horse man."""
3000,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3001,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""The fast-horse man got just exactly what he"
3002,A WILD IRISHMAN,"needed, too,"" said the genial Major, laughing, and"
3003,A WILD IRISHMAN,"mopping his perspiring brow.  ""The fellow was"
3004,A WILD IRISHMAN,barkin' up the wrong stump when he tackled
3005,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Tommy!  Got beat in the trade, at his own game,"
3006,A WILD IRISHMAN,"you know, and wound up by an insult that no Irishman"
3007,A WILD IRISHMAN,would take; and Tommy just naturally wore
3008,A WILD IRISHMAN,"out the hall carpet of the old hotel with him!"""
3009,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3010,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""And then collared and led him to the mayor's"
3011,A WILD IRISHMAN,"office himself, they say!"""
3012,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3013,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Oh, he did!"" said the Major, with a dash of"
3014,A WILD IRISHMAN,"pride in the confirmation; ""that's Tommy all over!"""
3015,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3016,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Funny trial, wasn't it?"" continued the ruminating"
3017,A WILD IRISHMAN,Stockford.
3018,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3019,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Wasn't it though?"" laughed the Major.  ""The"
3020,A WILD IRISHMAN,"porter's testimony:  You see, he was for Tommy,"
3021,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of course, and on examination testified that the"
3022,A WILD IRISHMAN,horseman struck Tommy first.  And here Tommy
3023,A WILD IRISHMAN,"broke in with:  'He's a-meanin' well, yer Honor, but"
3024,A WILD IRISHMAN,he's lyin' to ye--he's lyin' to ye.  No livin' man iver
3025,A WILD IRISHMAN,"struck me first--nor last, nayther, for the matter o'"
3026,A WILD IRISHMAN,"that!'  And I thought--the--court--would--die!"""
3027,A WILD IRISHMAN,"continued the Major, in a like imminent state of"
3028,A WILD IRISHMAN,merriment.
3029,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3030,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Yes, and he said if he struck him first,"""
3031,A WILD IRISHMAN,"supplemented Stockford, ""he'd like to know why the"
3032,A WILD IRISHMAN,"horseman was 'wearin' all the black eyes, and the"
3033,A WILD IRISHMAN,"blood, and the boomps on that head of um!'  And"
3034,A WILD IRISHMAN,"it's that talk that got him off with so light a fine!"""
3035,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3036,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""As it always does,"" said the Major, coming to"
3037,A WILD IRISHMAN,"himself abruptly and looking at his watch.  ""Stock,"
3038,A WILD IRISHMAN,you say you're not going along with our duck-shooting
3039,A WILD IRISHMAN,party this time?  The old Kankakee is just lousy
3040,A WILD IRISHMAN,"with 'em this season!"""
3041,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3042,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Can't go possibly,"" said Stockford, ""not on"
3043,A WILD IRISHMAN,"account of the work at all, but the folks ain't just"
3044,A WILD IRISHMAN,"as well as I'd like to see them, and I'll stay here till"
3045,A WILD IRISHMAN,they're better.  Next time I'll try and be ready for
3046,A WILD IRISHMAN,"you.  Going to take Tommy, of course?"""
3047,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3048,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Of course!  Got to have 'The Wild Irishman'"
3049,A WILD IRISHMAN,"with us!  I'm going around to find him now.""  Then"
3050,A WILD IRISHMAN,"turning to me the Major continued, ""Suppose you"
3051,A WILD IRISHMAN,get on your coat and hat and come along?  It's the
3052,A WILD IRISHMAN,best chance you'll ever have to meet Tommy.  It's
3053,A WILD IRISHMAN,"late anyhow, and Stockford'll get along without you."
3054,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Come on."""
3055,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3056,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Certainly,"" said Stockford; ""go ahead.  And you"
3057,A WILD IRISHMAN,"can take him ducking, too, if he wants to go."""
3058,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3059,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""But he doesn't want to go--and won't go,"""
3060,A WILD IRISHMAN,replied the Major with a commiserative glance at me.
3061,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Says he doesn't know a duck from a poll-parrot--"
3062,A WILD IRISHMAN,nor how to load a shotgun--and couldn't hit a house
3063,A WILD IRISHMAN,if he were inside of it and the door shut.  Admits
3064,A WILD IRISHMAN,"that he nearly killed his uncle once, on the other side"
3065,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of a tree, with a squirrel runnin' down it.  Don't"
3066,A WILD IRISHMAN,"want him along!"""
3067,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3068,A WILD IRISHMAN,"When I reached the street with the genial Major,"
3069,A WILD IRISHMAN,"he gave me this advice:  ""Now, when you meet Tommy, you mustn't"
3070,A WILD IRISHMAN,"take all he says for dead earnest,"
3071,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and you mustn't believe, because he talks loud, and"
3072,A WILD IRISHMAN,"in italics every other word, that he wants to do all"
3073,A WILD IRISHMAN,the talking and won't be interfered with.  That's the
3074,A WILD IRISHMAN,way he's apt to strike folks at first--but it's their
3075,A WILD IRISHMAN,"mistake, not his.  Talk back to him--controvert him"
3076,A WILD IRISHMAN,whenever he's aggressive in the utterance of his
3077,A WILD IRISHMAN,"opinions, and if you're only honest in the announcement"
3078,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of your own ideas and beliefs, he'll like you all"
3079,A WILD IRISHMAN,"the better for standing by them.  He's quick-tempered,"
3080,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and perhaps a trifle sensitive, so share your"
3081,A WILD IRISHMAN,"greater patience with him, and he'll pay you back by"
3082,A WILD IRISHMAN,"fighting for you at the drop of the hat.  In short, he's"
3083,A WILD IRISHMAN,"as nearly typical of his gallant country's brave,"
3084,A WILD IRISHMAN,"impetuous, fun-loving race as one man can be."""
3085,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3086,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""But is he quarrelsome?"" I asked."
3087,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3088,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Not at all.  There's the trouble.  If he'd only"
3089,A WILD IRISHMAN,quarrel there'd be no harm done.  Quarreling's
3090,A WILD IRISHMAN,"cheap, and Tommy's extravagant.  A big blacksmith"
3091,A WILD IRISHMAN,"here, the other day, kicked some boy out of his"
3092,A WILD IRISHMAN,"shop, and Tommy, on his cart, happened to be passing"
3093,A WILD IRISHMAN,at the time; and he just jumped off without a
3094,A WILD IRISHMAN,"word, and went in and worked on that fellow for"
3095,A WILD IRISHMAN,"about three minutes, with such disastrous results that"
3096,A WILD IRISHMAN,they couldn't tell his shop from a slaughter-house;
3097,A WILD IRISHMAN,"paid an assault and battery fine, and gave the boy a"
3098,A WILD IRISHMAN,"dollar besides, and the whole thing was a positive"
3099,A WILD IRISHMAN,luxury to him.  But I guess we'd better drop the
3100,A WILD IRISHMAN,"subject, for here's his cart, and here's Tommy.  Hi!"
3101,A WILD IRISHMAN,"there, you 'Fardown' Irish Mick!"" called the Major,"
3102,A WILD IRISHMAN,"in affected antipathy, ""been out raiding the honest"
3103,A WILD IRISHMAN,"farmers' hen-roosts again, have you?"""
3104,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3105,A WILD IRISHMAN,We had halted at a corner grocery and produce
3106,A WILD IRISHMAN,"store, as I took it, and the smooth-faced, shaven-"
3107,A WILD IRISHMAN,"headed man in woolen shirt, short vest, and suspenderless"
3108,A WILD IRISHMAN,trousers so boisterously addressed by the
3109,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Major, was just lifting from the back of his cart"
3110,A WILD IRISHMAN,a coop of cackling chickens.
3111,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3112,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Arrah! ye blasted Kerryonian!"" replied the"
3113,A WILD IRISHMAN,"handsome fellow, depositing the coop on the curb"
3114,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and straightening his tall, slender figure; ""I were"

3124,A WILD IRISHMAN,now; so come on at once.  We'll go 'round by Munson's
3125,A WILD IRISHMAN,and have Hi send a boy to look after your
3126,A WILD IRISHMAN,horse.  Come; I want to introduce my friend
3127,A WILD IRISHMAN,"here to you, and we'll all want to smoke and jabber"
3128,A WILD IRISHMAN,"a little in appropriate seclusion.  Come on.""  And"
3129,A WILD IRISHMAN,the impatient Major had linked arms with his hesitating
3130,A WILD IRISHMAN,"ally and myself, and was turning the corner"
3131,A WILD IRISHMAN,of the street.
3132,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3133,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""It's an hour's work I have yet wid the squawkers,"""
3134,A WILD IRISHMAN,"mildly protested Tommy, still hanging back"

3138,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3139,A WILD IRISHMAN,And five minutes later the three of us had joined
3140,A WILD IRISHMAN,"a very jolly party in a snug back room, with"

3149,A WILD IRISHMAN,"without, and, resurrecting long-dead Christmases,"
3150,A WILD IRISHMAN,brimmed the grateful memory with all comfortable

3152,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3153,A WILD IRISHMAN,A dozen hearty voices greeted the appearance of
3154,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Tommy and the Major, the latter adroitly pushing"

3210,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3211,A WILD IRISHMAN,There was a queer light in the eye of the
3212,A WILD IRISHMAN,Irishman.  I observed him narrowly--expectantly.  Often
3213,A WILD IRISHMAN,I had read of this phenomenal art of improvised
3214,A WILD IRISHMAN,"ballad-singing, but had always remained a little"
3215,A WILD IRISHMAN,skeptical in regard to the possibility of such a feat.
3216,A WILD IRISHMAN,Even in the notable instances of this gift as
3217,A WILD IRISHMAN,"displayed by the very clever Theodore Hook, I had"
3218,A WILD IRISHMAN,always half suspected some prior preparation--some
3219,A WILD IRISHMAN,adroit forecasting of the sequence that seemed the
3220,A WILD IRISHMAN,instant inspiration of his witty verses.  Here was
3221,A WILD IRISHMAN,"evidently to be a test example, and I was all alert"

3223,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3224,A WILD IRISHMAN,"The clamor had subsided, and Tommy had drawn"

3230,A WILD IRISHMAN,"was not unmusical, nor was the quaint old ballad-air"
3231,A WILD IRISHMAN,adopted by the singer unlovely in the least; simply
3232,A WILD IRISHMAN,a monotony was evident that accorded with the
3233,A WILD IRISHMAN,levity and chance-finish of the improvisation--and
3234,A WILD IRISHMAN,that the song was improvised on the instant I am

3236,A WILD IRISHMAN,"reasons, in rhythmic worth or finish.  And while his"

3264,A WILD IRISHMAN,And a half-dozen jubilant palms patted the
3265,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Major's shoulders, and his ruddy, good-natured"
3266,A WILD IRISHMAN,"face beamed with delight.  ""Now give it to the rest"
3267,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of 'em, Tommy!"" chuckled the Major.  And the"
3268,A WILD IRISHMAN,song continued:--
3269,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3270,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""And along wid 'Hank' is Mick Maharr,"
3271,A WILD IRISHMAN,"And Barney Pince, at 'The Shamrock' bar--"
3272,A WILD IRISHMAN,"There's Barney Pinch, wid his heart so true;"
3273,A WILD IRISHMAN,"And the Andrews Brothers they'll go too."""
3274,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3275,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3276,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Hold on, Tommy!"" chipped in one of the"

3279,A WILD IRISHMAN,"verse, can't you?"""
3280,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3281,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Make 'em pay for it if you do!"" said the Major"
3282,A WILD IRISHMAN,in an undertone.  And Tommy promptly amended.--
3283,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3284,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""O, the Andrews Brothers, they'll be there,"
3285,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Wid good se-gyars and wine to sphare,--"
3286,A WILD IRISHMAN,"They'll treat us here on fine champagne,"
3287,A WILD IRISHMAN,"And whin we're there they'll treat us again."""
3288,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3289,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3290,A WILD IRISHMAN,"The applause here was vociferous, and only"
3291,A WILD IRISHMAN,discontinued when a box of Havanas stood open on the
3292,A WILD IRISHMAN,"table.  During the momentary lull thus occasioned,"
3293,A WILD IRISHMAN,I caught the Major's twinkling eyes glancing evasively
3294,A WILD IRISHMAN,"toward me, as he leaned whispering some further"
3295,A WILD IRISHMAN,"instructions to Tommy, who again took up his"
3296,A WILD IRISHMAN,"desultory ballad, while I turned and fled for the"
3297,A WILD IRISHMAN,"street, catching, however, as I went, and high above"
3298,A WILD IRISHMAN,"the laughter of the crowd, the satire of this quatrain"
3299,A WILD IRISHMAN,to its latest line.
3300,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3301,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""But R-R-Riley he'll not go, I guess,"
3302,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Lest he'd get lost in the wil-der-ness,"
3303,A WILD IRISHMAN,And so in the city he will shtop
3304,A WILD IRISHMAN,"For to curl his hair in the barber shop."""
3305,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3306,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3307,A WILD IRISHMAN,"It was after six when I reached the hotel, but I"
3308,A WILD IRISHMAN,had my hair trimmed before I went in to supper.
3309,A WILD IRISHMAN,The style of trimming adopted then I still rigidly
3310,A WILD IRISHMAN,"adhere to, and call it ""the Tommy Stafford stubble-"
3311,A WILD IRISHMAN,"crop."""
3312,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3313,A WILD IRISHMAN,Ten days passed before I again saw the Major.
3314,A WILD IRISHMAN,Immediately upon his return--it was late afternoon
3315,A WILD IRISHMAN,when I heard of it--I determined to take my
3316,A WILD IRISHMAN,evening walk out the long street toward his pleasant
3317,A WILD IRISHMAN,"home and call on him there.  This I did, and"
3318,A WILD IRISHMAN,"found him in a wholesome state of fatigue, slippers"
3319,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and easy chair, enjoying his pipe on the piazza.  Of"
3320,A WILD IRISHMAN,"course, he was overflowing with happy reminiscences"
3321,A WILD IRISHMAN,of the hunt--the wood-and-water-craft--
3322,A WILD IRISHMAN,"boats--ambushes--decoys, and tramp, and camp,"
3323,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and so on, without end;--but I wanted to hear him"
3324,A WILD IRISHMAN,"talk of ""The Wild Irishman""--Tommy; and I think,"
3325,A WILD IRISHMAN,"too, now, that the sagacious Major secretly read my"
3326,A WILD IRISHMAN,desires all the time.  To be utterly frank with the
3327,A WILD IRISHMAN,reader I will admit that I not only think the Major
3328,A WILD IRISHMAN,"divined my interest in Tommy, but I know he did;"
3329,A WILD IRISHMAN,"for at last, as though reading my very thoughts, he"
3330,A WILD IRISHMAN,"abruptly said, after a long pause, in which he"
3331,A WILD IRISHMAN,knocked the ashes from his pipe and refilled and
3332,A WILD IRISHMAN,"lighted it:--""Well, all I know of 'The Wild Irishman'"
3333,A WILD IRISHMAN,"I can tell you in a very few words--that is,"
3334,A WILD IRISHMAN,"if you care at all to listen?""  And the crafty old"
3335,A WILD IRISHMAN,Major seemed to hesitate.
3336,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3337,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Go on--go on!"" I said eagerly."
3338,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3339,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""About forty years ago,"" resumed the Major"
3340,A WILD IRISHMAN,"placidly, ""in the little, old, unheard-of town"
3341,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Karnteel, County Tyrone, Province Ulster, Ireland,"
3342,A WILD IRISHMAN,Tommy Stafford was fortunate enough--despite
3343,A WILD IRISHMAN,the contrary opinion on that point of his wretchedly
3344,A WILD IRISHMAN,"poor parents--to be born.  And here, again, as I"
3345,A WILD IRISHMAN,"advised you the other day, you must be prepared for"
3346,A WILD IRISHMAN,"constant surprises in the study of Tommy's character."""
3347,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3348,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Go on,"" I said; ""I'm prepared for anything."""
3349,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3350,A WILD IRISHMAN,The Major smiled profoundly and continued:--
3351,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3352,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Fifteen years ago, when he came to America--"
3353,A WILD IRISHMAN,and the Lord only knows how he got the passage--
3354,A WILD IRISHMAN,money--he brought his widowed mother with him
3355,A WILD IRISHMAN,"here, and has supported, and is still supporting her."
3356,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Besides,"" went on the still secretly smiling Major,"
3357,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""the fellow has actually found time, through all his"
3358,A WILD IRISHMAN,"adversities, to pick up quite a smattering of education,"
3359,A WILD IRISHMAN,"here and there--"""
3360,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3361,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Poor fellow!"" I broke in sympathizingly, ""what"
3362,A WILD IRISHMAN,a pity it is that he couldn't have had such advantages
3363,A WILD IRISHMAN,"earlier in life,"" and as I recalled the broad brogue"
3364,A WILD IRISHMAN,"of the fellow, together with his careless dress,"
3365,A WILD IRISHMAN,recognizing beneath it all the native talent and
3366,A WILD IRISHMAN,"brilliancy of a mind of most uncommon worth, I could"
3367,A WILD IRISHMAN,not restrain a deep sigh of compassion and regret.
3368,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3369,A WILD IRISHMAN,The Major was leaning forward in the gathering
3370,A WILD IRISHMAN,"dusk, and evidently studying my own face, the"
3371,A WILD IRISHMAN,"expression of which, at that moment, was very grave"
3372,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and solemn, I am sure.  He suddenly threw himself"
3373,A WILD IRISHMAN,"backward in his chair, in an uncontrollable burst of"
3374,A WILD IRISHMAN,"laughter.  ""Oh, I just can't keep it up any longer,"""
3375,A WILD IRISHMAN,he exclaimed.
3376,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3377,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Keep what up?"" I queried, in a perfect maze of"
3378,A WILD IRISHMAN,"bewilderment and surprise.  ""Keep what up?"" I"
3379,A WILD IRISHMAN,repeated.
3380,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3381,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""Why, all this twaddle, farce, travesty and by-"
3382,A WILD IRISHMAN,"play regarding Tommy!  You know I warned you,"
3383,A WILD IRISHMAN,"over and over, and you mustn't blame me for the"
3384,A WILD IRISHMAN,deception.  I never thought you'd take it so in
3385,A WILD IRISHMAN,"earnest!"" and here the jovial Major again went into"
3386,A WILD IRISHMAN,convulsions of laughter.
3387,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3388,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""But I don't understand a word of it all,"" I cried,"
3389,A WILD IRISHMAN,half frenzied with the gnarl and tangle of the whole
3390,A WILD IRISHMAN,"affair.  ""What 'twaddle, farce and by-play,' is it,"
3391,A WILD IRISHMAN,"anyhow?""  And in my vexation, I found myself on"
3392,A WILD IRISHMAN,my feet and striding nervously up and down the
3393,A WILD IRISHMAN,"paved walk that joined the street with the piazza,"
3394,A WILD IRISHMAN,pausing at last and confronting the Major almost
3395,A WILD IRISHMAN,"petulantly.  ""Please explain,"" I said, controlling my"
3396,A WILD IRISHMAN,vexation with an effort.
3397,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3398,A WILD IRISHMAN,"The Major arose.  ""Your striding up and down"
3399,A WILD IRISHMAN,there reminds me that a little stroll on the street
3400,A WILD IRISHMAN,"might do us both good,"" he said.  ""Will you wait"
3401,A WILD IRISHMAN,"until I get a coat and hat?"""
3402,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3403,A WILD IRISHMAN,"He rejoined me a moment later, and we passed"
3404,A WILD IRISHMAN,"through the open gate; and saying, ""Let's go down"
3405,A WILD IRISHMAN,"this way,"" he took my arm and turned into a street,"
3406,A WILD IRISHMAN,"where, cooling as the dusk was, the thick maples"
3407,A WILD IRISHMAN,lining the walk seemed to throw a special shade of
3408,A WILD IRISHMAN,tranquillity upon us.
3409,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3410,A WILD IRISHMAN,"""What I meant was""--began the Major in a low"
3411,A WILD IRISHMAN,"serious voice,--""What I meant was--simply this:"
3412,A WILD IRISHMAN,"Our friend Tommy, though the truest Irishman in"
3413,A WILD IRISHMAN,"the world, is a man quite the opposite every way of"
3414,A WILD IRISHMAN,the character he has appeared to you.  All that rich
3415,A WILD IRISHMAN,"brogue of his is assumed.  Though he was poor, as I"
3416,A WILD IRISHMAN,"told you, when he came here, his native quickness,"
3417,A WILD IRISHMAN,"and his marvelous resources, tact, judgment, business"
3418,A WILD IRISHMAN,qualities--all have helped him to the equivalent
3419,A WILD IRISHMAN,of a liberal education.  His love of the humorous
3420,A WILD IRISHMAN,and the ridiculous is unbounded; but he has serious
3421,A WILD IRISHMAN,"moments, as well, and at such times is as dignified"
3422,A WILD IRISHMAN,and refined in speech and manner as any man you'd
3423,A WILD IRISHMAN,"find in a thousand.  He is a good speaker, can stir"
3424,A WILD IRISHMAN,a political convention to highest excitement when he
3425,A WILD IRISHMAN,gets fired up; and can write an article for the press
3426,A WILD IRISHMAN,that goes spang to the spot.  He gets into a great
3427,A WILD IRISHMAN,many personal encounters of a rather undignified
3428,A WILD IRISHMAN,character; but they are almost invariably bred of his
3429,A WILD IRISHMAN,"innate interest in the 'under dog,' and the fire and"
3430,A WILD IRISHMAN,"tow of his impetuous nature."""
3431,A WILD IRISHMAN,
3432,A WILD IRISHMAN,"My companion had paused here, and was looking"
3433,A WILD IRISHMAN,"through some printed slips in his pocketbook.  ""I"
3434,A WILD IRISHMAN,wanted you to see some of the fellow's articles in

3436,A WILD IRISHMAN,"some of his 'doggerel,' as he calls it, and you've had"
3437,A WILD IRISHMAN,a sample of that.  But here's a bit of the upper spirit
3438,A WILD IRISHMAN,of the man--and still another that you should hear

3615,MRS. MILLER,"time, in the role of ""county god,"" and haply"
3616,MRS. MILLER,"perpetuate the prouder title of ""the biggest taxpayer on"
3617,MRS. MILLER,"the assessment list.""  And this fact, too, fortunate"
3618,MRS. MILLER,"as it would seem, was doubtless the indirect occasion"
3619,MRS. MILLER,of a liberal percentage of all John's misfortunes.
3620,MRS. MILLER,From his earliest school-days in the little
3621,MRS. MILLER,"town, up to his tardy graduation from a distant"
3622,MRS. MILLER,"college, the influence of his father's wealth invited"
3623,MRS. MILLER,"his procrastination, humored its results, encouraged"
3624,MRS. MILLER,"the laxity of his ambition, ""and even now,"" as John"
3625,MRS. MILLER,"used, in bitter irony, to put it, ""it is aiding and"
3626,MRS. MILLER,abetting me in the ostensible practise of my chosen
3627,MRS. MILLER,"profession, a listless, aimless undetermined man of"
3628,MRS. MILLER,"forty, and a confirmed bachelor at that!""  At the"
3629,MRS. MILLER,"utterance of his self-depreciating statement, John generally"
3630,MRS. MILLER,jerked his legs down from the top of his
3631,MRS. MILLER,desk; and rising and kicking his chair back to the
3632,MRS. MILLER,wall he would stump around his littered office till
3633,MRS. MILLER,the manila carpet steamed with dust.  Then he
3634,MRS. MILLER,"would wildly break away, seeking refuge either in"
3635,MRS. MILLER,"the open street, or in his room at the old-time"
3636,MRS. MILLER,"tavern, The Eagle House, ""where,"" he would say, ""I"
3637,MRS. MILLER,"have lodged and boarded, I do solemnly asseverate,"
3638,MRS. MILLER,"for a long, unbroken, middle-aged eternity of ten"
3639,MRS. MILLER,"years, and can yet assert, in the words of the more"
3640,MRS. MILLER,"fortunately-dying Webster, that 'I still live'!"""
3641,MRS. MILLER,
3642,MRS. MILLER,"Extravagantly satirical as he was at times, John"
3643,MRS. MILLER,had always an indefinable drollery about him that
3644,MRS. MILLER,"made him agreeable company to his friends, at"
3645,MRS. MILLER,least; and such an admiring friend he had constantly
3646,MRS. MILLER,at hand in the person of Bert Haines.  Both
3647,MRS. MILLER,"were Bohemians in natural tendency, and, though"
3648,MRS. MILLER,"John was far in Bert's advance in point of age, he"
3649,MRS. MILLER,"found the young man ""just the kind of a fellow to"
3650,MRS. MILLER,"have around;"" while Bert, in turn, held his senior"
3651,MRS. MILLER,"in profound esteem--looked up to him, in fact, and"
3652,MRS. MILLER,even in his eccentricities strove to pattern himself
3653,MRS. MILLER,"after him.  And so it was, when summer days were"
3654,MRS. MILLER,"dull and tedious, these two could muse and doze the"
3655,MRS. MILLER,"hours away together; and when the nights were long,"
3656,MRS. MILLER,"and dark, and deep, and beautiful, they could drift"
3657,MRS. MILLER,"out in the noonlight of the stars, and with ""the soft"
3658,MRS. MILLER,"complaining flute"" and ""warbling lute,"" ""lay the"
3659,MRS. MILLER,"pipes,"" as John would say, for their enduring"
3660,MRS. MILLER,popularity with the girls!  And it was immediately
3661,MRS. MILLER,"subsequent to one of these romantic excursions, when"
3662,MRS. MILLER,"the belated pair, at two o'clock in the morning, had"
3663,MRS. MILLER,"skulked up a side stairway of the old hotel, and"
3664,MRS. MILLER,"gained John's room, with nothing more serious happening"
3665,MRS. MILLER,than Bert falling over a trunk and smashing
3666,MRS. MILLER,"his guitar,--just after such a night of romance and"
3667,MRS. MILLER,"adventure it was that, in the seclusion of John's"
3668,MRS. MILLER,"room, Bert had something of especial import to"
3669,MRS. MILLER,communicate.
3670,MRS. MILLER,
3671,MRS. MILLER,"""Mack,"" he said, as that worthy anathematized"
3672,MRS. MILLER,"a spiteful match, and then sucked his finger."
3673,MRS. MILLER,
3674,MRS. MILLER,"""Blast the all-fired old torch!"" said John, wrestling"
3675,MRS. MILLER,"with the lamp-flue, and turning on a welcome flame"
3676,MRS. MILLER,"at last.  ""Well, you said 'Mack'!  Why don't you"
3677,MRS. MILLER,"go on?  And don't bawl at the top of your lungs,"
3678,MRS. MILLER,either.  You've already succeeded in waking every
3679,MRS. MILLER,"boarder in the house with that guitar, and you want"
3680,MRS. MILLER,to make amends now by letting them go to sleep
3681,MRS. MILLER,"again!"""
3682,MRS. MILLER,
3683,MRS. MILLER,"""But my dear fellow,"" said Bert with forced"
3684,MRS. MILLER,"calmness, ""you're the fellow that's making all the"
3685,MRS. MILLER,"noise--and--"""
3686,MRS. MILLER,
3687,MRS. MILLER,"""Why, you howling dervish!"" interrupted John,"
3688,MRS. MILLER,with a feigned air of pleased surprise and
3689,MRS. MILLER,"admiration.  ""But let's drop controversy.  Throw the"
3690,MRS. MILLER,"fragments of your guitar in the wood-box there, and"
3691,MRS. MILLER,"proceed with the opening proposition."""
3692,MRS. MILLER,
3693,MRS. MILLER,"""What I was going to say was this,"" said Bert,"
3694,MRS. MILLER,"with a half-desperate enunciation; ""I'm getting"
3695,MRS. MILLER,"tired of this way of living--clean, dead-tired, and"
3696,MRS. MILLER,"fagged out, and sick of the whole artificial business!"""
3697,MRS. MILLER,
3698,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh, yes!"" exclaimed John, with a towering"
3699,MRS. MILLER,"disdain, ""you needn't go any further!  I know just"
3700,MRS. MILLER,what malady is throttling you.  It's reform--reform!
3701,MRS. MILLER,"You're going to 'turn over a new leaf,' and"
3702,MRS. MILLER,"all that, and sign the pledge, and quit cigars, and"
3703,MRS. MILLER,"go to work, and pay your debts, and gravitate back"
3704,MRS. MILLER,"into Sunday-school, where you can make love to"
3705,MRS. MILLER,"the preacher's daughter under the guise of religion,"
3706,MRS. MILLER,and desecrate the sanctity of the innermost pale of
3707,MRS. MILLER,the church by confessions at Class of your 'thorough
3708,MRS. MILLER,"conversion'!  Oh, you're going to--"""
3709,MRS. MILLER,
3710,MRS. MILLER,"""No, but I'm going to do nothing of the sort,"""
3711,MRS. MILLER,"interrupted Bert resentfully.  ""What I mean--if"
3712,MRS. MILLER,"you'll let me finish--is, I'm getting too old to be"
3713,MRS. MILLER,eternally undignifying myself with this 'singing of
3714,MRS. MILLER,"midnight strains under Bonnybell's window-panes,'"
3715,MRS. MILLER,and too old to be keeping myself in constant
3716,MRS. MILLER,humiliation and expense by the borrowing and stringing
3717,MRS. MILLER,"up of old guitars, together with the breakage of the"
3718,MRS. MILLER,"same, and the general wear-and-tear on a constitution"
3719,MRS. MILLER,that is slowly being sapped to its foundations
3720,MRS. MILLER,"by exposure in the night-air and the dew."""
3721,MRS. MILLER,
3722,MRS. MILLER,"""And while you receive no further compensation"
3723,MRS. MILLER,"in return,"" said John, ""than, perhaps, the coy turning"
3724,MRS. MILLER,up of a lamp at an upper casement where the
3725,MRS. MILLER,jasmine climbs; or an exasperating patter of
3726,MRS. MILLER,invisible palms; or a huge dank wedge of fruit-cake
3727,MRS. MILLER,"shoved at you by the old man, through a crack in"
3728,MRS. MILLER,"the door."""
3729,MRS. MILLER,
3730,MRS. MILLER,"""Yes, and I'm going to have my just reward, is"
3731,MRS. MILLER,"what I mean,"" said Bert, ""and exchange the lover's"
3732,MRS. MILLER,life for the benedict's.  Going to hunt out a good
3733,MRS. MILLER,"sensible girl and marry her.""  And as the young"
3734,MRS. MILLER,man concluded this desperate avowal he jerked the
3735,MRS. MILLER,"bow of his cravat into a hard knot, kicked his hat"
3736,MRS. MILLER,"under the bed, and threw himself on the sofa like"
3737,MRS. MILLER,an old suit.
3738,MRS. MILLER,
3739,MRS. MILLER,John stared at him with absolute compassion.
3740,MRS. MILLER,"""Poor devil,"" he said half musingly, ""I know just"
3741,MRS. MILLER,how he feels--
3742,MRS. MILLER,
3743,MRS. MILLER,"""Ring in the wind his wedding chimes,"
3744,MRS. MILLER,"Smile, villagers, at every door;"

3747,MRS. MILLER,
3748,MRS. MILLER,
3749,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh, here!"" exclaimed the wretched Bert, jumping"
3750,MRS. MILLER,"to his feet; ""let up on that dismal recitative.  It"
3751,MRS. MILLER,"would make a dog howl to hear that!"""
3752,MRS. MILLER,
3753,MRS. MILLER,"""Then you 'let up' on that suicidal talk of"
3754,MRS. MILLER,"marrying,"" replied John, ""and all that harangue of"
3755,MRS. MILLER,"incoherency about your growing old.  Why, my dear"
3756,MRS. MILLER,"fellow, you're at least a dozen years my junior,"
3757,MRS. MILLER,"and look at me!"" and John glanced at himself in the"
3758,MRS. MILLER,"glass with a feeble pride, noting the gray sparseness"
3759,MRS. MILLER,"of his side-hair, and its plaintive dearth on"
3760,MRS. MILLER,"top.  ""Of course I've got to admit,"" he continued,"
3761,MRS. MILLER,"""that my hair is gradually evaporating; but for all"
3762,MRS. MILLER,"that, I'm 'still in the ring,' don't you know; as"
3763,MRS. MILLER,"young in society, for the matter of that, as yourself!"
3764,MRS. MILLER,And this is just the reason why I don't want
3765,MRS. MILLER,you to blight every prospect in your life by marrying
3766,MRS. MILLER,at your age--especially a woman--I mean the
3767,MRS. MILLER,"kind of woman you'd be sure to fancy at your age."""
3768,MRS. MILLER,
3769,MRS. MILLER,"""Didn't I say 'a good sensible girl' was the kind"
3770,MRS. MILLER,"I had selected?"" Bert remonstrated."
3771,MRS. MILLER,
3772,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh!"" exclaimed John, ""you've selected her,"
3773,MRS. MILLER,"then?--and without one word to me!"" he ended,"
3774,MRS. MILLER,rebukingly.
3775,MRS. MILLER,
3776,MRS. MILLER,"""Well, hang it all!"" said Bert impatiently; ""I"
3777,MRS. MILLER,"knew how YOU were, and just how you'd talk me"
3778,MRS. MILLER,"out of it; and I made up my mind that for once, at"
3779,MRS. MILLER,"least, I'd follow the dictations of a heart that--"
3780,MRS. MILLER,however capricious in youthful frivolities--should
3781,MRS. MILLER,"beat, in manhood, loyal to itself and loyal to its"
3782,MRS. MILLER,"own affinity."""
3783,MRS. MILLER,
3784,MRS. MILLER,"""Go it!  Fire away!  Farewell, vain world!"""
3785,MRS. MILLER,"exclaimed the excited John.--""Trade your soul off for"
3786,MRS. MILLER,a pair of ear-bobs and a button-hook--a hank of
3787,MRS. MILLER,jute hair and a box of lily-white!  I've buried not
3788,MRS. MILLER,"less than ten old chums this way, and here's another"
3789,MRS. MILLER,"nominated for the tomb."""
3790,MRS. MILLER,
3791,MRS. MILLER,"""But you've got no REASON about you,"" began"
3792,MRS. MILLER,"Bert,--""I want to""--"
3793,MRS. MILLER,
3794,MRS. MILLER,"""And so do _I_ 'want to,' "" broke in John finally,"
3795,MRS. MILLER,"--""I want to get some sleep.--So 'register' and"

3798,MRS. MILLER,about as narrow as your views of single blessedness!
3799,MRS. MILLER,Peace!  Not another word!  Pile in!  Pile
3800,MRS. MILLER,"in!  I'm three-parts sick, anyhow, and I want"
3801,MRS. MILLER,"rest!""  And very truly he spoke."
3802,MRS. MILLER,
3803,MRS. MILLER,It was a bright morning when the slothful John
3804,MRS. MILLER,was aroused by a long vociferous pounding on the
3805,MRS. MILLER,door.  He started up in bed to find himself alone--
3806,MRS. MILLER,the victim of his wrathful irony having evidently
3807,MRS. MILLER,risen and fled away while his pitiless tormentor
3808,MRS. MILLER,"slept--""Doubtless to accomplish at once that"
3809,MRS. MILLER,nefarious intent as set forth by his unblushing
3810,MRS. MILLER,"confession of last night,"" mused the miserable John."
3811,MRS. MILLER,And he ground his fingers in the corners of his
3812,MRS. MILLER,"swollen eyes, and leered grimly in the glass at the"
3813,MRS. MILLER,"feverish orbs, blood-shot, blurred and aching."
3814,MRS. MILLER,
3815,MRS. MILLER,The pounding on the door continued.  John
3816,MRS. MILLER,looked at his watch; it was only eight o'clock.
3817,MRS. MILLER,
3818,MRS. MILLER,"""Hi, there!"" he called viciously.  ""What do you"
3819,MRS. MILLER,"mean, anyhow?"" he went on, elevating his voice"
3820,MRS. MILLER,"again; ""shaking a man out of bed when he's just"
3821,MRS. MILLER,"dropping into his first sleep?"""
3822,MRS. MILLER,
3823,MRS. MILLER,"""I mean that you're going to get up; that's what!"""
3824,MRS. MILLER,"replied a firm female voice.  ""It's eight o'clock, and I"
3825,MRS. MILLER,want to put your room in order; and I'm not going
3826,MRS. MILLER,"to wait all day about it, either!  Get up and go"
3827,MRS. MILLER,"down to your breakfast, and let me have the room!"""
3828,MRS. MILLER,And the clamor at the door was industriously renewed.
3829,MRS. MILLER,
3830,MRS. MILLER,"""Say!"" called John querulously, hurrying on his"
3831,MRS. MILLER,"clothes, ""Say, you!"""
3832,MRS. MILLER,
3833,MRS. MILLER,"""There's no 'say' about it!"" responded the"
3834,MRS. MILLER,"determined voice:  ""I've heard about you and your"
3835,MRS. MILLER,"ways around this house, and I'm not going to put"
3836,MRS. MILLER,up with it!  You'll not lie in bed till high noon
3837,MRS. MILLER,"when I've got to keep your room in proper order!"""
3838,MRS. MILLER,
3839,MRS. MILLER,"""Oh, ho!"" bawled John intelligently: ""reckon"
3840,MRS. MILLER,you're the new invasion here?  Doubtless you're
3841,MRS. MILLER,that girl that's been hanging up the new window-
3842,MRS. MILLER,"blinds that won't roll, and disguising the pillows"
3843,MRS. MILLER,"with clean slips, and hennin' round among my"
3844,MRS. MILLER,"books and papers on the table here, and aging me"
3845,MRS. MILLER,generally till I don't know my own handwriting by
3846,MRS. MILLER,"the time I find it!  Oh, yes, you're going to"
3847,MRS. MILLER,revolutionize things here; you're going to introduce
3848,MRS. MILLER,"promptness, and system, and order.  See you've"
3849,MRS. MILLER,even filled the wash-pitcher and tucked two starched
3850,MRS. MILLER,towels through the handle.  Haven't got any tin
3851,MRS. MILLER,"towels, have you?  I rather like this new soap, too!"
3852,MRS. MILLER,"So solid and durable, you know; warranted not to"
3853,MRS. MILLER,raise a lather.  Might as well wash one's hands with
3854,MRS. MILLER,"a door-knob!"""
3855,MRS. MILLER,
3856,MRS. MILLER,And as John's voice grumbled away into the
3857,MRS. MILLER,"sullen silence again, the determined voice without"
3858,MRS. MILLER,"responded:  ""Oh, you can growl away to your"
3859,MRS. MILLER,"heart's content, Mr. McKinney, but I want you"
3860,MRS. MILLER,to understand distinctly that I'm not going to humor
3861,MRS. MILLER,"you in any of your old bachelor, sluggardly,"
3862,MRS. MILLER,"slovenly ways, and whims and notions.  And I"
3863,MRS. MILLER,"want you to understand, too, that I'm not hired"
3864,MRS. MILLER,"help in this house, nor a chambermaid, nor anything"
3865,MRS. MILLER,of the kind.  I'm the landlady here; and I'll give you
3866,MRS. MILLER,"just ten minutes more to get down to your breakfast,"
3867,MRS. MILLER,"or you'll not get any--that's all!""  And as"
3868,MRS. MILLER,the reversed cuff John was in the act of buttoning
3869,MRS. MILLER,"slid from his wrist and rolled under the dresser, he"
3870,MRS. MILLER,heard a stiff rustling of starched muslin flouncing
3871,MRS. MILLER,"past the door, and the quick italicized patter of"
3872,MRS. MILLER,determined gaiters down the hall.
3873,MRS. MILLER,
3874,MRS. MILLER,"""Look here,"" said John to the bright-faced boy"
3875,MRS. MILLER,"in the hotel office, a half hour later.  ""It seems the"
3876,MRS. MILLER,"house here's been changing hands again."""
3877,MRS. MILLER,
3878,MRS. MILLER,"""Yes, sir,"" said the boy, closing the cigar case,"
3879,MRS. MILLER,"and handing him a lighted match.  ""Well, the new"
3880,MRS. MILLER,"landlord, whoever he is,"" continued John, patronizingly,"
3881,MRS. MILLER,"""is a good one.  Leastwise, he knows what's"
3882,MRS. MILLER,"good to eat, and how to serve it."""
3883,MRS. MILLER,
3884,MRS. MILLER,"The boy laughed timidly,--""It ain't a 'landlord,'"
3885,MRS. MILLER,"though--it's a landlady; it's my mother."""
3886,MRS. MILLER,
3887,MRS. MILLER,"""Ah,"" said John, dallying with the change the"
3888,MRS. MILLER,"boy had pushed toward him.  ""Your mother, eh?"
3889,MRS. MILLER,"And where's your father?"""
3890,MRS. MILLER,
3891,MRS. MILLER,"""He's dead,"" said the boy."
3892,MRS. MILLER,
3893,MRS. MILLER,"""And what's this for?"" abruptly asked John,"
3894,MRS. MILLER,examining his change.
3895,MRS. MILLER,
3896,MRS. MILLER,"""That's your change,"" said the boy:  ""You got"
3897,MRS. MILLER,"three for a quarter, and gave me a half."""
3898,MRS. MILLER,
3899,MRS. MILLER,"""Well, YOU just keep it,"" said John, sliding back"
3900,MRS. MILLER,"the change.  ""It's for good luck, you know, my boy."
3901,MRS. MILLER,Same as drinking your long life and prosperity.
3902,MRS. MILLER,"And, oh yes, by the way, you may tell your mother"
3903,MRS. MILLER,"I'll have a friend to dinner with me to-day."""
3904,MRS. MILLER,
3905,MRS. MILLER,"""Yes, sir, and thank you, sir,"" said the beaming"
3906,MRS. MILLER,boy.
3907,MRS. MILLER,
3908,MRS. MILLER,"""Handsome boy!"" mused John, as he walked"
3909,MRS. MILLER,"down street.  ""Takes that from his father, though,"
3910,MRS. MILLER,"I'll wager my existence!"""
3911,MRS. MILLER,
3912,MRS. MILLER,Upon his office desk John found a hastily written
3913,MRS. MILLER,note.  It was addressed in the well-known hand of
3914,MRS. MILLER,"his old chum.  He eyed the missive apprehensively,"
3915,MRS. MILLER,and there was a positive pathos in his voice as he
3916,MRS. MILLER,"said aloud, ""It's our divorce.  I feel it!""  The note,"
3917,MRS. MILLER,"headed, ""At the Office, Four in Morning,"" ran like"
3918,MRS. MILLER,this:
3919,MRS. MILLER,
3920,MRS. MILLER,
3921,MRS. MILLER,"""Dear Mack--I left you slumbering so soundly"
3922,MRS. MILLER,"that, by noon, when you waken, I hope, in your"
3923,MRS. MILLER,"refreshed state, you will look more tolerantly on my"
3924,MRS. MILLER,intentions as partially confided to you this night.  I
3925,MRS. MILLER,will not see you here again to say good-by.  I
3926,MRS. MILLER,"wanted to, but was afraid to 'rouse the sleeping"
3927,MRS. MILLER,"lion.'  I will not close my eyes to-night--fact is, I"
3928,MRS. MILLER,haven't time.  Our serenade at Josie's was a
3929,MRS. MILLER,prearranged signal by which she is to be ready and at
3930,MRS. MILLER,the station for the five morning train.  You may
3931,MRS. MILLER,remember the lighting of three consecutive matches
3932,MRS. MILLER,at her window before the igniting of her lamp.
3933,MRS. MILLER,"That meant, 'Thrice dearest one, I'll meet thee at"
3934,MRS. MILLER,"the depot at four-thirty sharp.'  So, my dear Mack,"
3935,MRS. MILLER,"this is to inform you that, even as you read, Josie"
3936,MRS. MILLER,"and I have eloped.  It is all the old man's fault, yet"
3937,MRS. MILLER,I forgive him.  Hope he'll return the favor.  Josie
3938,MRS. MILLER,"predicts he will, inside of a week--or two weeks"

4621,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"utterance, and the Professor was impetuously"
4622,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,fluttering his hands about the subject's upward-
4623,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"staring eyes, stroking his temples, and snapping his"

4629,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"hilarity and loud and long applause, perhaps,"
4630,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,that the Professor was relieved from the explanation
4631,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,of this rather astounding phenomenon of the

4633,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"my impious friend scoffed the incongruity later,"
4634,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"in a particularly withering allusion, as the ""blank-"

4644,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"could not until utter quiet was restored, adding"
4645,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,the further appeal that the young man had already
4646,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"been a long time under the mesmeric spell, and"

4656,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4657,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"And truly, too, it was a grotesque pose the young"
4658,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"man had assumed; not wholly ridiculous either,"
4659,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,since the dwarfed position he had settled into
4660,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,seemed more a genuine physical condition than an
4661,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"affected one.  The head, back-tilted, and sunk between"
4662,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"the shoulders, looked abnormally large, while"
4663,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,the features of the face appeared peculiarly child-
4664,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"like--especially the eyes--wakeful and wide apart,"
4665,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"and very bright, yet very mild and very artless; and"
4666,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"the drawn and cramped outline of the legs and feet,"
4667,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"and of the arms and hands, even to the shrunken,"
4668,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"slender-looking fingers, all combined to convey most"
4669,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,strikingly to the pained senses the fragile frame
4670,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"and pixy figure of some pitiably afflicted child,"
4671,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,unconscious altogether of the pathos of its own deformity.
4672,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4673,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"""Now, mark the cuss, Horatio!"" gasped my"
4674,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,friend.

4676,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"At first the speaker's voice came very low, and"

4678,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"voice it was, of brittle and erratic timbre and undulant"
4679,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,inflection.  Yet it was beautiful.  It had the
4680,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"ring of childhood in it, though the ring was not pure"
4681,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"golden, and at times fell echoless.  The SPIRIT of its"
4682,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,utterance was always clear and pure and crisp and
4683,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"cheery as the twitter of a bird, and yet forever ran"
4684,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,an undercadence through it like a low-pleading
4685,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"prayer.  Half garrulously, and like a shallow brook"
4686,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"might brawl across a shelvy bottom, the rhythmic"
4687,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,little changeling thus began:--

4698,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4699,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4700,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,A few titterings from the younger people in the
4701,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"audience marked the opening stanza, while a certain"
4702,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"restlessness, and a changing to more attentive positions"
4703,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"seemed the general tendency.  The old Professor,"
4704,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"in the meantime, had sunk into one of the"
4705,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,empty chairs.  The speaker went on with more gaiety:--
4706,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4707,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"""I'm nine years old!  An' you can't guess how much I weigh, I"

4718,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4719,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4720,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,Just in front of me a great broad-shouldered
4721,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"countryman, with a rainy smell in his cumbrous"
4722,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"overcoat, cleared his throat vehemently, looked"
4723,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"startled at the sound, and again settled forward, his"
4724,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,weedy chin resting on the knuckles of his hands as
4725,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,they tightly clutched the seat before him.  And it
4726,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,was like being taken into a childish confidence as the
4727,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,quaint speech continued:--
4728,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4729,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"""I set--while Aunty's washin'--on my little long-leg stool,"

4750,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"must!  There; listen!""  And the plaintive gaiety"
4751,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,of the homely poem ran on:--
4752,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,
4753,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"""At evening, when the ironin' 's done, an' Aunty's fixed the"

4770,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"""Look at everybody!"" said I.  And the artless"
4771,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,little voice went on again half quaveringly:--

4773,I SET STILL AND CHAW MY COOD!,"""But Aunty's all so childish-like on my account, you see"

4823,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
4824,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,It was a dim and chill and loveless afternoon in
4825,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,the late fall of eighty-three when I first saw
4826,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,the genial subject of this hasty sketch.  From time
4827,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,to time the daily paper on which I worked had been
4828,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"receiving, among the general literary driftage of"
4829,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"amateur essayists, poets and sketch-writers, some"
4830,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,conceits in verse that struck the editorial head as
4831,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"decidedly novel; and, as they were evidently the"
4832,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"production of an unlettered man, and an OLD man,"
4833,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"and a farmer at that, they were usually spared the"
4834,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"waste-basket, and preserved--not for publication,"
4835,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,but to pass from hand to hand among the members
4836,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,of the staff as simply quaint and mirth-provoking
4837,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,specimens of the verdancy of both the venerable
4838,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,author and the Muse inspiring him.  Letters as
4839,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,quaint as were the poems invariably accompanied
4840,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"them, and the oddity of these, in fact, had first called"
4841,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,attention to the verses.  I well remember the general
4842,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,merriment of the office when the first of the old
4843,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"man's letters was read aloud, and I recall, too, some"
4844,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"of his comments on his own verse, verbatim.  In"
4845,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"one place he said:  ""I make no doubt you will find some purty SAD"
4846,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"spots in my poetry, considerin'; but"
4847,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,I hope you will bear in mind that I am a great
4848,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"sufferer with rheumatizum, and have been, off and"
4849,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"on, sence the cold New Years.  In the main, however,"""
4850,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"he continued, ""I allus aim to write in a cheerful,"
4851,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"comfortin' sperit, so's ef the stuff hangs fire,"
4852,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"and don't do no good, it hain't a-goin' to do no"
4853,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"harm,--and them's my honest views on poetry."""
4854,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
4855,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"In another letter, evidently suspecting his poem"
4856,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,had not appeared in print because of its dejected
4857,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"tone, he said:  ""The poetry I herewith send was"
4858,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,wrote off on the finest Autumn day I ever laid eyes
4859,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,on!  I never felt better in my life.  The morning air
4860,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"was as invigoratin' as bitters with tanzy in it, and the"
4861,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,folks at breakfast said they never saw such a' appetite
4862,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,on mortal man before.  Then I lit out for the
4863,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"barn, and after feedin', I come back and tuck my"
4864,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"pen and ink out on the porch, and jest cut loose.  I"
4865,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,writ and writ till my fingers was that cramped I
4866,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,couldn't hardly let go of the penholder.  And the
4867,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,poem I send you is the upshot of it all.  Ef you don't
4868,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"find it cheerful enough fer your columns, I'll have"
4869,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"to knock under, that's all!""  And that poem, as I recall"
4870,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"it, certainly was cheerful enough for publication,"
4871,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"only the ""copy"" was almost undecipherable, and the"
4872,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"ink, too, so pale and vague, it was thought best to"
4873,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"reserve the verses, for the time, at least, and later on"
4874,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"revise, copy, punctuate, and then print it sometime,"
4875,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,as much for the joke of it as anything.  But it
4876,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"was still delayed, neglected, and in a week's time"
4877,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,almost entirely forgotten.  And so it was upon this
4878,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,chill and somber afternoon I speak of that an event
4879,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,occurred which most pleasantly reminded me of
4880,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"both the poem with the ""sad spots"" in it, and the"
4881,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"""cheerful"" one, ""writ out on the porch"" that glorious"
4882,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"autumn day, that poured its glory through the"
4883,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,old man's letter to us.
4884,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
4885,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,Outside and in the sanctum the gloom was too
4886,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,oppressive to permit an elevated tendency of either
4887,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,thought or spirit.  I could do nothing but sit listless
4888,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"and inert.  Paper and pencil were before me, but"
4889,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"I could not write--I could not even think coherently,"
4890,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,and was on the point of rising and rushing out into
4891,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"the streets for a wild walk, when there came a"
4892,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,hesitating knock at the door.
4893,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
4894,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"""Come in!"" I snarled, grabbing up my pencil and"
4895,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"assuming a frightfully industrious air:  ""Come in!"""
4896,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"I almost savagely repeated, ""Come in!  And shut the"
4897,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"door behind you!"" and I dropped my lids, bent my"
4898,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,gaze fixedly upon the blank pages before me and
4899,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,began scrawling some disconnected nothings with
4900,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,no head or tail or anything.
4901,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
4902,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"""Sir; howdy,"" said a low and pleasant voice.  And"
4903,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"at once, in spite of my perverse resolve, I looked up."
4904,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,I someway felt rebuked.
4905,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
4906,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"The speaker was very slowly, noiselessly closing"

5227,YORK CITY,
5228,YORK CITY,Since we have had no stories to-night I will
5229,YORK CITY,"venture, Mr. President, to tell a story that I"
5230,YORK CITY,have heretofore heard at nearly all the banquets I
5231,YORK CITY,"have ever attended.  It is a story simply, and you"
5232,YORK CITY,must bear with it kindly.  It is a story as told by
5233,YORK CITY,"a friend of us all, who is found in all parts of all"
5234,YORK CITY,"countries, who is immoderately fond of a funny"
5235,YORK CITY,"story, and who, unfortunately, attempts to tell a"
5236,YORK CITY,funny story himself--one that he has been particularly
5237,YORK CITY,"delighted with.  Well, he is not a story-teller,"
5238,YORK CITY,and especially he is not a funny story-teller.  His
5239,YORK CITY,"funny stories, indeed, are oftentimes touchingly"
5240,YORK CITY,"pathetic.  But to such a story as he tells, being a"
5241,YORK CITY,"good-natured man and kindly disposed, we have to"
5242,YORK CITY,"listen, because we do not want to wound his feelings"
5243,YORK CITY,by telling him that we have heard that story a
5244,YORK CITY,"great number of times, and that we have heard it"
5245,YORK CITY,ably told by a great number of people from the time
5246,YORK CITY,"we were children.  But, as I say, we can not hurt his"
5247,YORK CITY,feelings.  We can not stop him.  We can not kill him;
5248,YORK CITY,and so the story generally proceeds.  He selects a very old story
5249,YORK CITY,"always, and generally tells it in about"
5250,YORK CITY,this fashion:
5251,YORK CITY,
5252,YORK CITY,I heerd an awful funny thing the other day--ha!
5253,YORK CITY,"ha!  I don't know whether I kin git it off er not,"
5254,YORK CITY,"but, anyhow, I'll tell it to you.  Well!--le's see now"
5255,YORK CITY,"how the fool-thing goes.  Oh, yes!--W'y, there was"
5256,YORK CITY,a feller one time--it was during the army and this
5257,YORK CITY,feller that I started in to tell you about was in the
5258,YORK CITY,"war and--ha! ha!--there was a big fight a-goin' on,"
5259,YORK CITY,"and this feller was in the fight, and it was a big battle"
5260,YORK CITY,"and bullets a-flyin' ever' which way, and bomb-"
5261,YORK CITY,"shells a-bu'stin', and cannon-balls a-flyin' 'round"
5262,YORK CITY,"promiskus; and this feller right in the midst of it,"
5263,YORK CITY,"you know, and all excited and het up, and chargin'"
5264,YORK CITY,away; and the fust thing you know along come a
5265,YORK CITY,cannon-ball and shot his head off--ha! ha! ha!
5266,YORK CITY,"Hold on here a minute!--no, sir; I'm a-gittin' ahead"
5267,YORK CITY,"of my story; no, no; it didn't shoot his HEAD off--"
5268,YORK CITY,I'm gittin' the cart before the horse there--shot his
5269,YORK CITY,LEG off; that was the way; shot his leg off; and
5270,YORK CITY,"down the poor feller drapped, and, of course, in that"
5271,YORK CITY,"condition was perfectly he'pless, you know, but yit"
5272,YORK CITY,with presence o' mind enough to know that he was
5273,YORK CITY,in a dangerous condition ef somepin' wasn't done fer
5274,YORK CITY,"him right away.  So he seen a comrade a-chargin',"
5275,YORK CITY,"by that he knowed, and he hollers to him and called"
5276,YORK CITY,him by name--I disremember now what the feller's
5277,YORK CITY,name was. . . .
5278,YORK CITY,
5279,YORK CITY,"Well, that's got nothin' to do with the story,"
5280,YORK CITY,"anyway; he hollers to him, he did, and says, ""Hello,"
5281,YORK CITY,"there,"" he says to him; ""here, I want you to come"
5282,YORK CITY,"here and give me a lift; I got my leg shot off, and"
5283,YORK CITY,"I want you to pack me back to the rear of the battle"""
5284,YORK CITY,"--where the doctors always is, you know, during a"
5285,YORK CITY,"fight--and he says, ""I want you to pack me back"
5286,YORK CITY,there where I can get med-dy-cinal attention er I'm
5287,YORK CITY,"a dead man, fer I got my leg shot off,"" he says,"
5288,YORK CITY,"""and I want you to pack me back there so's"
5289,YORK CITY,"the surgeons kin take keer of me.""  Well--"
5290,YORK CITY,"the feller, as luck would have it, ricko'nized him"
5291,YORK CITY,"and run to him and throwed down his own musket,"
5292,YORK CITY,so's he could pick him up; and he stooped down and
5293,YORK CITY,picked him up and kindo' half-way shouldered him
5294,YORK CITY,"and half-way helt him betwixt his arms like, and"
5295,YORK CITY,then he turned and started back with him--ha! ha!
5296,YORK CITY,"ha!  Now, mind, the fight was still a-goin' on--and"
5297,YORK CITY,"right at the hot of the fight, and the feller, all"
5298,YORK CITY,"excited, you know, like he was, and the soldier that"
5299,YORK CITY,"had his leg shot off gittin' kindo' fainty like, and his"
5300,YORK CITY,head kindo' stuck back over the feller's shoulder
5301,YORK CITY,that was carryin' him.  And he hadn't got more'n a
5302,YORK CITY,couple o' rods with him when another cannon-ball
5303,YORK CITY,"come along and tuk his head off, shore enough!--"
5304,YORK CITY,and the curioust thing about it was--ha! ha!--that
5305,YORK CITY,the feller was a-packin' him didn't know that he
5306,YORK CITY,"had been hit ag'in at all, and back he went--still"
5307,YORK CITY,carryin' the deceased back--ha! ha! ha!--to where
5308,YORK CITY,the doctors could take keer of him--as he thought.
5309,YORK CITY,"Well, his cap'n happened to see him, and he thought"
5310,YORK CITY,it was a ruther cur'ous p'ceedin's--a soldier carryin'
5311,YORK CITY,a dead body out o' the fight--don't you see?  And
5312,YORK CITY,"so he hollers at him, and he says to the soldier, the"
5313,YORK CITY,"cap'n did, he says, ""Hullo, there; where you goin'"
5314,YORK CITY,"with that thing?"" the cap'n said to the soldier who"
5315,YORK CITY,was a-carryin' away the feller that had his leg shot
5316,YORK CITY,"off.  Well, his head, too, by that time.  So he says,"
5317,YORK CITY,"""Where you going with that thing?"" the cap'n said"
5318,YORK CITY,to the soldier who was a-carryin' away the feller that
5319,YORK CITY,"had his leg shot off.  Well, the soldier he stopped--"
5320,YORK CITY,"kinder halted, you know, like a private soldier will"
5321,YORK CITY,when his presidin' officer speaks to him--and he says
5322,YORK CITY,"to him, ""W'y,"" he says, ""Cap, it's a comrade o' mine"
5323,YORK CITY,"and the pore feller has got his leg shot off, and I'm"
5324,YORK CITY,a-packin' him back to where the doctors is; and there
5325,YORK CITY,"was nobody to he'p him, and the feller would 'a' died"
5326,YORK CITY,in his tracks--er track ruther--if it hadn't a-been fer
5327,YORK CITY,"me, and I'm a-packin' him back where the surgeons"
5328,YORK CITY,can take keer of him; where he can get medical
5329,YORK CITY,"attendance--er his wife's a widder!"" he says, "" 'cause"
5330,YORK CITY,"he's got his leg shot off!""  Then CAP'N says, ""You"
5331,YORK CITY,"blame fool you, he's got his HEAD shot off.""  So then"
5332,YORK CITY,the feller slacked his grip on the body and let it
5333,YORK CITY,"slide down to the ground, and looked at it a minute,"
5334,YORK CITY,"all puzzled, you know, and says, ""W'y, he told me"
5335,YORK CITY,"it was his leg!""  Ha! ha! ha!"

5343,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5344,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Of what shall be said herein of dialect, let it be"
5345,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,understood the term dialect referred to is of
5346,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"that general breadth of meaning given it to-day,"
5347,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"namely, any speech or vernacular outside of the"
5348,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,prescribed form of good English in its present state.
5349,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"The present state of the English is, of course, not"
5350,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,any one of its prior states.  So first let it be
5351,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,remarked that it is highly probable that what may
5352,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,have been the best of English once may now by some
5353,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"be counted as a weak, inconsequent patois, or"
5354,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,dialect.
5355,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5356,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"To be direct, it is the object of this article to show"
5357,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,that dialect is not a thing to be despised in any event
5358,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,--that its origin is oftentimes of as royal caste as
5359,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"that of any speech.  Listening back, from the stand-"
5360,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"point of to-day, even to the divine singing of that old"
5361,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,classic master to whom England's late laureate

5374,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Made beautiful with song""--"
5375,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5376,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Chaucer's verse to us is NOW as veritably dialect as
5377,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,to that old time it was the chastest English; and even
5378,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,then his materials were essentially dialect when his
5379,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"song was at best pitch.  Again, our present dialect,"
5380,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of most plebeian ancestry, may none the less prove"
5381,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,worthy.  Mark the recognition of its own personal
5382,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"merit in the great new dictionary, where what was,"
5383,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"in our own remembrance, the most outlandish dialect,"
5384,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"is now good, sound, official English."
5385,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5386,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Since Literature must embrace all naturally
5387,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"existing materials--physical, mental and spiritual--we"
5388,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,have no occasion to urge its acceptance of so-called
5389,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"dialect, for dialect IS in Literature, and HAS been"
5390,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,there since the beginning of all written thought and
5391,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"utterance.  Strictly speaking, as well as paradoxically,"
5392,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"all verbal expression is more or less dialectic,"
5393,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,however grammatical.  While usage establishes
5394,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"grammar, it no less establishes so-called dialect."
5395,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Therefore we may as rightfully refer to ""so-called"
5396,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"grammar."""
5397,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5398,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,It is not really a question of Literature's position
5399,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"toward dialect that we are called upon to consider,"
5400,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,but rather how much of Literature's valuable time
5401,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,shall be taken up by this dialectic country cousin.
5402,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,This question Literature her gracious self most
5403,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,amiably answers by hugging to her breast voluminous
5404,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"tomes, from Chaucer on to Dickens, from"
5405,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Dickens on to Joel Chandler Harris.  And this
5406,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"affectionate spirit on the part of Literature, in the"
5407,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"main, we all most feelingly indorse."
5408,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5409,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Briefly summed, it would appear that dialect"
5410,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,means something more than mere rude form of
5411,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"speech and action--that it must, in some righteous"
5412,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and substantial way, convey to us a positive force"
5413,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of soul, truth, dignity, beauty, grace, purity and"
5414,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,sweetness that may even touch us to the tenderness
5415,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of tears.  Yes, dialect as certainly does all this as"
5416,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"that speech and act refined may do it, and for the"
5417,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"same reasons: it is simply, purely natural and"
5418,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,human.
5419,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5420,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Yes, the Lettered and the Unlettered powers are"
5421,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"at sword's points; and very old and bitter foemen,"
5422,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"too, they are.  As fairly as we can, then, let us look"
5423,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,over the field of these contending forces and note
5424,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"their diverse positions: First, THE LETTERED--they"
5425,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"who have the full advantages of refined education,"
5426,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"training, and association--are undoubtedly as"
5427,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,wholly out of order among the UNLETTERED as the
5428,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Unlettered are out of order in the exalted presence
5429,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of the Lettered.  Each faction may in like aversion
5430,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,ignore or snub the other; but a long-suffering Providence
5431,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,must bear with the society of both.  There
5432,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,may be one vague virtue demonstrated by this feud:
5433,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,each division will be found unwaveringly loyal to
5434,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"its kind, and mutually they desire no interchange of"
5435,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,sympathy whatever.--Neither element will accept
5436,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"from the other any PATRONIZING treatment; and,"
5437,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"perhaps, the more especially does the UNLETTERED faction"
5438,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,reject anything in vaguest likeness of this spirit.  Of
5439,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the two divisions, in graphic summary,--ONE knows"
5440,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the very core and center of refined civilization, and"
5441,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,this only; the OTHER knows the outlying wilds and
5442,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"suburbs of civilization, and this only.  Whose, therefore,"
5443,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"is the greater knowledge, and whose the just"
5444,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,right of any whit of self-glorification?
5445,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5446,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"A curious thing, indeed, is this factional pride, as"
5447,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"made equally manifest in both forces; in one, for"
5448,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"instance, of the Unlettered forces:  The average"
5449,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"farmer, or countryman, knows, in reality, a far better"
5450,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and wider range of diction than he permits himself
5451,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,to use.  He restricts and abridges the vocabulary
5452,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of his speech, fundamentally, for the reason"
5453,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"that he fears offending his rural NEIGHBORS, to whom"
5454,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"a choicer speech might suggest, on his part, an"
5455,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"assumption--a spirit of conscious superiority, and"
5456,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,therewith an implied reflection on THEIR lack of
5457,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,intelligence and general worthiness.  If there is any
5458,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,one text universally known and nurtured of the
5459,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Unlettered masses of our common country, it is that"
5460,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"which reads, ""All men are created equal.""  Therefore"
5461,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,it is a becoming thing when true gentility prefers
5462,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"to overlook some variations of the class who,"
5463,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,more from lack of cultivation than out of rude
5464,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"intent, sometimes almost compel a positive doubt of"
5465,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the nice veracity of the declaration, or at least a"
5466,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,grief at the munificent liberality of the so-bequoted
5467,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,statement.  The somewhat bewildering position of
5468,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,these conflicting forces leaves us nothing further to
5469,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"consider, but how to make the most and best of the"
5470,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,situation so far as Literature may be hurt or helped
5471,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,thereby.
5472,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5473,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Equally with the perfect English, then, dialect"
5474,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,should have full justice done it.  Then always it is
5475,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"worthy, and in Literature is thus welcome.  The"
5476,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,writer of dialect should as reverently venture in its
5477,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,use as in his chastest English.  His effort in the
5478,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,SCHOLARLY and ELEGANT direction suffers no neglect--
5479,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"he is SCHOOLED in that, perhaps, he may explain."
5480,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Then let him be SCHOOLED in DIALECT before he sets
5481,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"up as an expounder of it--a teacher, forsooth a"
5482,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,master!  The real master must not only know each
5483,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"varying light and shade of dialect expression, but"
5484,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,he must as minutely know the inner character of the
5485,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"people whose native tongue it is, else his product is"
5486,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"simply a pretense--a wilful forgery, a rank"
5487,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"abomination.  Dialect has been and is thus insulted,"
5488,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"vilified, and degraded, now and continually; and"
5489,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"through this outrage solely, thousands of generous-"
5490,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,minded readers have been turned against dialect
5491,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,who otherwise would have loved and blessed it in
5492,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,its real form of crude purity and unstrained sweetness--
5493,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5494,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Honey dripping from the comb.
5495,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5496,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5497,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Let no impious faddist, then, assume its just"
5498,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,interpretation.  He may know everything else in the
5499,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"world, but not dialect, nor dialectic people, for both"
5500,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of which he has supreme contempt, which same, be"
5501,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"sure, is heartily returned.  Such a ""superior"""
5502,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,personage may even go among these simple country
5503,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"people and abide indefinitely in the midst of them,"
5504,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,yet their more righteous contempt never for one instant
5505,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,permits them to be their real selves in his presence.
5506,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"In consequence, his most conscientious report"
5507,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of them, their ways, lives, and interests, is absolutely"
5508,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of no importance or value in the world.  He
5509,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"never knew them, nor will he ever know them.  They"
5510,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"are not his kind of people, any more than he is their"
5511,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,kind of man; and THEIR disappointment grieves us
5512,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,more than his.
5513,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5514,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"The master in Literature, as in any art, is that"
5515,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"""divinely gifted man"" who does just obeisance to"
5516,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"all living creatures, ""both man and beast and bird."""
5517,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"It is this master only who, as he writes, can sweep"
5518,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,himself aside and leave his humble characters to do
5519,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the thinking and the talking.  This man it is who
5520,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,celebrates his performance--not himself.  His work
5521,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"he celebrates because it is not his only, but because"
5522,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,he feels it to be the conscientious reproduction of
5523,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,life itself--as he has seen and known and felt it;--a
5524,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"representation it is of God's own script, translated"
5525,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and transcribed by the worshipful mind and heart
5526,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and hand of genius.  This virtue is impartially
5527,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"demanded in all art, and genius only can fully"
5528,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,answer the demand in any art for which we claim
5529,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"perfection.  The painter has his expression of it,"
5530,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"with no slighting of the dialect element; so, too, the"
5531,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"sculptor, the musician, and the list entire.  In the"
5532,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"line of Literature and literary material, an illustration"
5533,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of the nice meaning and distinction of the art
5534,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of dialect will be found in Charles Dudley Warner's
5535,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"comment on George Cable's work, as far back as"
5536,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"1883, referring to the author's own rendition of it"
5537,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,from the platform.  Mr. Warner says:
5538,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5539,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,While the author was unfolding to his audience a life
5540,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and society unfamiliar to them and entrancing them with
5541,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"pictures, the reality of which none doubted and the spell"
5542,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of which none cared to escape, it occurred to me that here"
5543,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,was the solution of all the pother we have recently got into
5544,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,about the realistic and the ideal schools in fiction.  In
5545,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"""Posson Jone,"" an awkward camp-meeting country preacher"
5546,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,is the victim of a vulgar confidence game; the scenes are
5547,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the street, a drinking-place, a gambling-saloon, a bull-ring,"
5548,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and a calaboose; there is not a ""respectable"" character in"
5549,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,it.  Where shall we look for a more faithful picture of low
5550,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,life?  Where shall we find another so vividly set forth in
5551,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"all its sordid details?  And yet see how art steps in, with"
5552,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the wand of genius, to make literature!  Over the whole the"
5553,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"author has cast an ideal light; over a picture that, in the"
5554,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"hands of a bungling realist, would have been repellent he"
5555,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,has thrown the idealizing grace that makes it one of the
5556,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"most charming sketches in the world.  Here is nature, as"
5557,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"nature only ought to be in literature, elevated but never"
5558,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,departed from.
5559,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5560,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5561,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"So we find dialect, as a branch of literature,"
5562,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,worthy of the high attention and employment of
5563,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the greatest master in letters--not the merest
5564,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"mountebank.  Turn to Dickens, in innumerable"
5565,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"passages of pathos: the death of poor Jo, or that"
5566,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of the ""Cheap John's"" little daughter in her father's"
5567,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"arms, on the foot-board of his peddling cart before"
5568,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the jeering of the vulgar mob; smile moistly, too,"
5569,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,at Mr. Sleary's odd philosophies; or at the trials
5570,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of Sissy Jupe; or lift and tower with indignation,"
5571,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,giving ear to Stephen Blackpool and the stainless
5572,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,nobility of his cloyed utterances.
5573,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5574,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,The crudeness or the homeliness of the dialectic
5575,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,element does not argue its unfitness in any way.
5576,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Some readers seem to think so; but they are wrong,"
5577,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and very gravely wrong.  Our own brief history as
5578,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"a nation, and our finding and founding and maintaining"
5579,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of it, left our forefathers little time indeed"
5580,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,for the delicate cultivation of the arts and graces
5581,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of refined and scholarly attainments.  And there
5582,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"is little wonder, and utter blamelessness on their"
5583,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"part, if they lapsed in point of high mental"
5584,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"accomplishments, seeing their attention was so absorbed"
5585,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,by propositions looking toward the protection of
5586,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"their rude farm-homes, their meager harvests, and"
5587,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,their half-stabled cattle from the dread invasion of
5588,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the Indian.  Then, too, they had their mothers and"
5589,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"their wives and little ones to protect, to clothe, to"
5590,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"feed, and to die for in this awful line of duty, as"
5591,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,hundreds upon hundreds did.  These sad facts are
5592,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,here accented and detailed not so much for the sake
5593,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of being tedious as to indicate more clearly why it
5594,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"was that many of the truly heroic ancestors of ""our"
5595,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"best people"" grew unquestionably dialect of caste"
5596,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"--not alone in speech, but in every mental trait and"
5597,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,personal address.  It is a grievous fact for us to
5598,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"confront, but many of them wore apparel of the"
5599,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"commonest, talked loudly, and doubtless said ""thisaway"""
5600,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and ""thataway,"" and ""Watch y' doin' of?"""
5601,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and ""Whur yi goin' at?""--using dialect even in"
5602,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"their prayers to Him who, in His gentle mercy,"
5603,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,listened and was pleased; and who listens verily
5604,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"unto this hour to all like prayers, yet pleased; yea,"
5605,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,haply listens to the refined rhetorical petitions of
5606,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,those who are NOT pleased.
5607,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5608,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,There is something more at fault than the language
5609,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"when we turn from or flinch at it; and, as"
5610,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"has been intimated, the wretched fault may be"
5611,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,skulkingly hidden away in the ambush of OSTENSIBLE
5612,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,dialect--that type of dialect so copiously produced
5613,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"by its sole manufacturers, who, utterly stark and"
5614,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,bare of the vaguest idea of country life or country
5615,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"people, at once assume that all their ""gifted pens"""
5616,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,have to do is stupidly to misspell every word;
5617,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"vulgarly mistreat and besloven every theme, however"
5618,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"sacred; maim, cripple, and disfigure language never"
5619,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,in the vocabulary of the countryman--then smuggle
5620,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,these monstrosities of either rhyme or prose somehow
5621,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,into the public print that is innocently to smear
5622,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,them broadcast all over the face of the country they
5623,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,insult.
5624,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5625,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,How different the mind and method of the true
5626,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,intrepreter.  As this phrase goes down the man
5627,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,himself arises--the type perfect--Colonel Richard
5628,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Malcolm Johnston, who wrote ""The Dukesborough"
5629,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Tales""--an accomplished classical scholar and"
5630,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"teacher, yet no less an accomplished master and"
5631,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"lover of his native dialect of middle Georgia.  He,"
5632,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"like Dickens, permits his rustic characters to think,"
5633,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"talk, act and live, Just as nature designed them.  He"
5634,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,does not make the pitiable error of either
5635,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,patronizing or making fun of them.  He knows them and
5636,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,he loves them; and they know and love him in
5637,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,return.  Recalling Colonel Johnston's dialectic
5638,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"sketches, with his own presentation of them from"
5639,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the platform, the writer notes a fact that seems"
5640,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"singularly to obtain among all true dialect-writers,"
5641,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"namely, that they are also endowed with native"
5642,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"histrionic capabilities:  HEAR, as well as read, Twain,"
5643,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Cable, Johnston, Page, Smith, and all the list with"
5644,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,barely an exception.
5645,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5646,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Did space permit, no better illustration of true"
5647,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,dialect sketch and characterization might here be
5648,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,offered than Colonel Johnston's simple story of
5649,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"""Mr. Absalom Billingslea,"" or the short and simple"
5650,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"annals of his like quaint contemporaries, ""Mr. Bill"
5651,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Williams"" and ""Mr. Jonas Lively.""  The scene is"
5652,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the country and the very little country town, with"
5653,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"landscape, atmosphere, simplicity, circumstance--all"
5654,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,surroundings and conditions--VERITABLE--everything
5655,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"rural and dialectic, no less than the simple,"
5656,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"primitive, common, wholesome-hearted men and women"
5657,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,who so naturally live and have their blessed being
5658,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"in his stories, just as in the life itself.  This is the"
5659,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,manifest work of the true dialect writer and
5660,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"expounder.  In every detail, the most minute, such"
5661,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,work reveals the master-hand and heart of the
5662,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,humanitarian as well as artist--the two are indissolubly
5663,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,fused--and the result of such just treatment
5664,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of whatever lowly themes or characters we can but
5665,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,love and loyally approve with all our human hearts.  Such masters
5666,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"necessarily are rare, and such ripe"
5667,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,perfecting as is here attained may be in part the
5668,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"mellowing result of age and long observation,"
5669,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"though it can be based upon the wisest, purest"
5670,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,spirit of the man as well as artist.
5671,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5672,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,With no less approval should the work of Joel
5673,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Chandler Harris be regarded:  His touch alike is
5674,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,ever reverential.  He has gathered up the bruised
5675,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and broken voices and the legends of the slave,"
5676,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and from his child-heart he has affectionately
5677,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,yielded them to us in all their eery beauty and
5678,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,wild loveliness.  Through them we are made to
5679,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,glorify the helpless and the weak and to revel in
5680,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"their victories.  But, better, we are taught that even"
5681,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,in barbaric breasts there dwells inherently the sense
5682,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of right above wrong-equity above law-and the
5683,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,One Unerring Righteousness Eternal.  With equal
5684,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"truth and strength, too, Mr. Harris has treated the"
5685,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,dialectic elements of the interior Georgia country--
5686,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the wilds and fastnesses of the ""moonshiners.""  His"
5687,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"tale of Teague Poteet, of some years ago, was"
5688,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,contemporaneous with the list of striking mountain
5689,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"stories from that strong and highly gifted Tennesseean,"
5690,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Miss Murfree, or ""Charles Egbert Craddock."""
5691,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,In the dialectic spirit her stories charm and
5692,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"hold us.  Always there is strangely mingled, but"
5693,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"most naturally, the gentle nature cropping out amid"
5694,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the most desperate and stoical: the night scene in
5695,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the isolated mountain cabin, guarded ever without"
5696,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and within from any chance down-swooping of the
5697,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,minions of the red-eyed law; the great man-group
5698,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of gentle giants, with rifles never out of arm's-"
5699,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"reach, in tender rivalry ranged admiringly around"
5700,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the crowing, wakeful little boy-baby; the return, at"
5701,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"last, of the belated mistress of the house--the sister,"
5702,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"to whom all do great, awkward reverence.  Jealously"
5703,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"snatching up the babe and kissing it, she"
5704,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,querulously demands why he has not long ago been
5705,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"put to bed.  ""He 'lowed he wouldn't go,"" is the"
5706,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,reply.
5707,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5708,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Thomas Nelson Page, of Virginia, who wrote"
5709,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Meh Lady--a positive classic in the negro dialect:
5710,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,his work is veritable--strong and pure and
5711,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,sweet; and as an oral reader of it the doubly gifted
5712,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"author, in voice and cadence, natural utterance,"
5713,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"every possible effect of speech and tone, is doubtless"
5714,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,without rival anywhere.
5715,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5716,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Many more, indeed, than may be mentioned now"
5717,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,there are of these real benefactors and preservers
5718,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"of the wayside characters, times, and customs of our"
5719,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,ever-shifting history.  Needless is it to speak here of
5720,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the earlier of our workers in the dialectic line--of
5721,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"James Russell Lowell's New England Hosea Biglow,"
5722,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Dr. Eggleston's Hoosier School-Master, or"
5723,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"the very rare and quaint, bright prattle of Helen's"
5724,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Babies.  In connection with this last let us very
5725,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,seriously inquire what this real child has done that
5726,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Literature should so persistently refuse to give him
5727,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,an abiding welcome?  Since for ages this question
5728,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"seems to have been left unasked, it may be timely"
5729,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,now to propound it.  Why not the real child in
5730,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Literature?  The real child is good enough (we all
5731,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,know he is bad enough) to command our admiring
5732,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"attention and most lively interest in real life, and"
5733,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"just as we find him ""in the raw.""  Then why do we"
5734,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,deny him any righteous place of recognition in our
5735,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Literature?  From the immemorial advent of our
5736,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"dear old Mother Goose, Literature has been especially"
5737,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"catering to the juvenile needs and desires, and"
5738,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"yet steadfastly overlooking, all the time, the very"
5739,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,principles upon which Nature herself founds and
5740,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,presents this lawless little brood of hers--the
5741,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,children.  It is not the children who are out of order;
5742,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,it is Literature.  And not only is Literature out of
5743,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"order, but she is presumptuous; she is impudent."
5744,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,She takes Nature's children and revises and corrects
5745,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"them till ""their own mother doesn't know them."""
5746,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"This is literal fact.  So, very many of us are coming"
5747,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"to inquire, as we've a right, why is the real child"
5748,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,excluded from a just hearing in the world of letters
5749,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"as he has in the world of fact?  For instance,"
5750,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,what has the lovely little ragamuffin ever done of
5751,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,sufficient guilt to consign him eternally to the
5752,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,monstrous penalty of speaking most accurate grammar
5753,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,all the literary hours of the days of the years of his
5754,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,otherwise natural life?
5755,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5756,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"""Oh, mother, may I go to school"
5757,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,With brother Charles to-day?
5758,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,The air is very fine and cool;
5759,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Oh, mother, say I may!"""
5760,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5761,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"--Is this a real boy that would make such a request,"
5762,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and is it the real language he would use?  No, we"
5763,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"are glad to say that it is not.  Simply it is a libel,"
5764,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"in every particular, on any boy, however fondly"
5765,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,and exactingly trained by parents however zealous
5766,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"for his overdecorous future.  Better, indeed, the"
5767,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"dubious sentiment of the most trivial nursery jingle,"
5768,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,since the latter at least maintains the lawless though
5769,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,wholesome spirit of the child-genuine.--
5770,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5771,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"""Hink!  Minx!  The old witch winks--"
5772,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,The fat begins to fry;
5773,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"There's nobody home but Jumping Joan,"
5774,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Father and mother and I."""
5775,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5776,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,Though even here the impious poet leaves the scar
5777,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of grammatical knowledge upon childhood's native
5778,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,diction; and so the helpless little fellow is again
5779,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"misrepresented, and his character, to all intents and"
5780,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"purposes, is assaulted and maligned outrageously"
5781,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,thereby.
5782,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,
5783,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"Now, in all seriousness, this situation ought not"
5784,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"to be permitted to exist, though to change it seems"
5785,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"an almost insurmountable task.  The general public,"
5786,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"very probably, is not aware of the real gravity of"
5787,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the position of the case as even unto this day it
5788,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"exists.  Let the public try, then, to contribute the"
5789,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,real child to the so-called Child Literature of its
5790,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"country, and have its real child returned as promptly"
5791,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,as it dare show its little tousled head in the presence
5792,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of that scholarly and dignified institution.  Then
5793,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,ask why your real child has been spanked back
5794,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"home again, and the wise mentors there will virtually"
5795,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"tell you that Child Literature wants no real children in it, that"
5796,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the real child's example of
5797,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,defective grammar and lack of elegant deportment
5798,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,would furnish to its little patrician patrons suggestions
5799,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"very hurtful indeed to their higher morals,"
5800,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"tendencies, and ambitions.  Then, although the general"
5801,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,public couldn't for the life of it see why or
5802,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"how, and might even be reminded that it was just"
5803,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"such a rowdying child itself, and that its FATHER--"
5804,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,the Father of his Country--was just such a child;
5805,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"that Abraham Lincoln was just such a lovable, lawless"
5806,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"child, and yet was blessed and chosen in the"
5807,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,end for the highest service man may ever render
5808,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"unto man,--all--all this argument would avail not"
5809,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"in the least, since the elegantly minded purveyors"
5810,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,of Child Literature can not possibly tolerate the
5811,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,presence of any but the refined children--the very
5812,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"proper children--the studiously thoughtful, poetic"
5813,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"children,--and these must be kept safe from the"
5814,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,contaminating touch of our rough-and-tumble little
5815,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"fellows in ""hodden gray,"" with frowzly heads,"
5816,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"begrimed but laughing faces, and such awful, awful"

5818,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,"and brazen faith and trust, and love of life and"
5819,DIALECT IN LITERATURE,everybody in it.  All other real people are getting
