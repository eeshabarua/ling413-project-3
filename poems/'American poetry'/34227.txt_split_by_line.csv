61,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,_The first two of the poems here printed have long been popular
62,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,"favorites, but the third was not written till near the end of Mr."
63,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,Harte's life. It rounds out the romance with such completeness and charm
64,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,"that it is peculiarly fitting that the poems should be grouped, and"
65,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,issued in a form worthy of their own excellence. The coöperation of Mr.
66,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,"Keller was secured for making the illustrations, not only on account of"
67,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,"his recognized ability as an artist, but also because of his admiration"
68,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,for Mr. Harte's writings and his previous success in illustrating
69,PUBLISHERS' NOTE,several of the stories._
