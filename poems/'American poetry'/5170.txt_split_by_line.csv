107,THE EMPTY BOWL,
108,THE EMPTY BOWL,
109,THE EMPTY BOWL,I held the golden vessel of my soul
110,THE EMPTY BOWL,And prayed that God would fill it from on high.
111,THE EMPTY BOWL,Day after day the importuning cry
112,THE EMPTY BOWL,"Grew stronger—grew, a heaven-accusing dole"
113,THE EMPTY BOWL,Because no sacred waters laved my bowl.
114,THE EMPTY BOWL,"‘So full the fountain, Lord, wouldst Thou deny"
115,THE EMPTY BOWL,The little needed for a soul’s supply?
116,THE EMPTY BOWL,I ask but this small portion of Thy whole.’
117,THE EMPTY BOWL,"Then from the vast invisible Somewhere,"
118,THE EMPTY BOWL,"A voice, as one love-authorised by Him,"
119,THE EMPTY BOWL,"Spake, and the tumult of my heart was stilled."
120,THE EMPTY BOWL,‘Who wants the waters must the bowl prepare;
121,THE EMPTY BOWL,"Pour out the self, that chokes it to the brim,"
122,THE EMPTY BOWL,"But emptied vessels, from the source are filled.’"

130,KEEP GOING,"Is the goal distant, and troubled the road,"
131,KEEP GOING,And the way long?
132,KEEP GOING,And heavy your load?
133,KEEP GOING,"Then gird up your courage, and say ‘I am strong,’"
134,KEEP GOING,And keep going.
135,KEEP GOING,
136,KEEP GOING,"Is the work weary, and endless the grind"
137,KEEP GOING,And petty the pay?
138,KEEP GOING,Then brace up your mind
139,KEEP GOING,"And say ‘Something better is coming my way,’"
140,KEEP GOING,And keep doing.
141,KEEP GOING,
142,KEEP GOING,Is the drink bitter life pours in your cup—
143,KEEP GOING,Is the taste gall?
144,KEEP GOING,Then smile and look up
145,KEEP GOING,"And say ‘God is with me whatever befall,’"
146,KEEP GOING,And keep trusting.
147,KEEP GOING,
148,KEEP GOING,"Is the heart heavy with hope long deferred,"
149,KEEP GOING,And with prayers that seem vain?
150,KEEP GOING,Keep saying the word—
151,KEEP GOING,And that which you strive for you yet shall attain.
152,KEEP GOING,Keep praying.

166,A PRAYER,"From all that is unworthy and unkind,"
167,A PRAYER,"Am I not master of my mind, dear Lord?"

181,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,
182,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,
183,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"Here in my cosy corner,"
184,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"Before a blazing log,"
185,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,I’m thinking of cold London
186,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,Wrapped in its killing fog;
187,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"And, like a shining beacon"
188,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"Above the picture grim,"
189,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"I see the London ‘Bobby,’"
190,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,And sing my song for him.
191,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,
192,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"I see his stalwart figure,"
193,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"I see his kindly face,"
194,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,I hear his helpful answer
195,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,At any hour or place.
196,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"For, though you seek some by-way"
197,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"Long miles from his own beat,"
198,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"He tells you all about it,"
199,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,And how to find the street.
200,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,
201,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"He looks like some bold Viking,"
202,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,This king of earth’s police—
203,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"Yet in his voice lies feeling,"
204,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,And in his eye lies peace;
205,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,He knows and does his duty—
206,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,(What higher praise is there?)
207,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,And London’s lords and paupers
208,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,Alike receive his care.
209,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,
210,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"He has a regal bearing,"
211,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,Yet one that breathes repose;
212,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,It is the look and manner
213,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,Of one who _thinks_ and _knows_.
214,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"Oh, men who govern nations,"
215,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,"In old worlds or in new,"
216,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,Turn to the London ‘Bobby’
217,POLICEMEN OF ENGLAND’S CAPITAL,And learn a thing or two.

226,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS)
227,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),
228,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),The Radiant Rulers of Mystic Regions
229,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Where souls of artists are fitted for birth
230,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Gathered together their lovely legions
231,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),And fashioned a woman to shine on earth.
232,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"They bathed her in splendour,"
233,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"They made her tender,"
234,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),They gave her a nature both sweet and wild;
235,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"They gave her emotions like storm-stirred oceans,"
236,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),And they gave her the heart of a little child.
237,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),
238,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),These Radiant Rulers (who are not human
239,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Nor yet divine like the gods above)
240,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Poured all their gifts in the soul of woman,"
241,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),That fragile vessel meant only for love.
242,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Still more they taught her,"
243,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Still more they brought her,"
244,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Till they gave her the world for a harp one day:
245,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"And they bade her string it,"
246,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"They bade her ring it,"
247,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),While the stars all wondered to hear her play.
248,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),
249,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"She touched the strings in a master fashion,"
250,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),She uttered the cry of a world’s despair:
251,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Its long hid secret, its pent-up passion,"
252,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),She gave to the winds in a vibrant air.
253,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"For oh! the heart of her,"
254,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),That was the art of her.
255,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Great with the feeling that makes men kin.
256,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Art unapproachable,"
257,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Art all uncoachable,"
258,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Fragrance and flame from the spirit within.
259,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),
260,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),The earth turns ever an ear unheeding
261,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"To the sorrows of art, as it cries ‘encore.’"
262,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"And she played on the harp till her hands were bleeding,"
263,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),And her brow was bruised by the laurels she wore.
264,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"She knew the trend of it,"
265,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),She knew the end of it—
266,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Men heard the music and men felt the thrill.
267,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Bound to the altar
268,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"Of art, could she falter?"
269,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Then came a silence—the music was still.
270,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),
271,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),And yet in the echoes we seem to hear it;
272,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),In waves unbroken it circles the earth:
273,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),And we catch in the light of her dauntless spirit
274,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),A gleam from the centre that gave her birth.
275,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Still is the fame of her
276,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),Felt in the name of her—
277,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),But low lies the harp that once thrilled to her strain;
278,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),"No hand has taken it,"
279,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),No hand can waken it—
280,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),For the soul of her art was her secret of pain.
281,(AMERICA’S GREAT EMOTIONAL ACTRESS),

287,TWO GHOSTS,
288,TWO GHOSTS,Two dead men boarded a spectral ship
289,TWO GHOSTS,In the astral Port of Space;
290,TWO GHOSTS,"On that ghost-filled barque, they met in the dark,"
291,TWO GHOSTS,"And halted, face to face."
292,TWO GHOSTS,
293,TWO GHOSTS,"‘Now whither away’—called one of the ghosts,"
294,TWO GHOSTS,‘This ship sets sail for Earth.
295,TWO GHOSTS,"On the astral plane you must remain,"
296,TWO GHOSTS,Where the newly dead have birth.’
297,TWO GHOSTS,
298,TWO GHOSTS,"‘But I could not stay and I would not stay,’"
299,TWO GHOSTS,The other ghost replied;
300,TWO GHOSTS,‘I must hurry back to the old Earth track
301,TWO GHOSTS,And stand at my loved one’s side.
302,TWO GHOSTS,
303,TWO GHOSTS,"‘She weeps for me in her lonely room,"
304,TWO GHOSTS,In the land from whence I came;
305,TWO GHOSTS,"Oh! stow me away in this ship, I pray,"
306,TWO GHOSTS,For I hear her call my name.’
307,TWO GHOSTS,
308,TWO GHOSTS,"‘You must not go, and you shall not go,’"
309,TWO GHOSTS,The first ghost cried in wrath.
310,TWO GHOSTS,"‘Your work is planned, in the astral land,"
311,TWO GHOSTS,And a guide will show you the path.’
312,TWO GHOSTS,
313,TWO GHOSTS,"‘But the one I love’—‘I loved her too,’"
314,TWO GHOSTS,The first ghost stood and cried;
315,TWO GHOSTS,"‘And year on year I waited here,"
316,TWO GHOSTS,"Yea, waited till you died."
317,TWO GHOSTS,
318,TWO GHOSTS,"‘For I would not come between you two,"
319,TWO GHOSTS,"Nor shadow her joy with fear,"
320,TWO GHOSTS,"But mine is the right, I claim this night"
321,TWO GHOSTS,To visit the earthly sphere.
322,TWO GHOSTS,
323,TWO GHOSTS,"‘For you are dead, and I am dead,"
324,TWO GHOSTS,And you had her long—so long.
325,TWO GHOSTS,"And to look on the grace of her worshipped face,"
326,TWO GHOSTS,Ah! now it can do no wrong.
327,TWO GHOSTS,
328,TWO GHOSTS,"‘I am fettered to Earth by love of her,"
329,TWO GHOSTS,"And hers is the spell divine,"
330,TWO GHOSTS,"That can help me rise, to the realm that lies"
331,TWO GHOSTS,Just over the astral line.
332,TWO GHOSTS,
333,TWO GHOSTS,"‘I have kept to the laws of God and man,"
334,TWO GHOSTS,I have suffered and made no moan;
335,TWO GHOSTS,"Now my little share of joy, I swear"
336,TWO GHOSTS,I will have—and have it alone.’
337,TWO GHOSTS,
338,TWO GHOSTS,"A skeleton crew the anchor drew,"
339,TWO GHOSTS,And the ship from the port swung free;
340,TWO GHOSTS,"With a muffled clang the ghost bell rang,"
341,TWO GHOSTS,And the boat sailed out to sea.
342,TWO GHOSTS,
343,TWO GHOSTS,"And one ghost stood on the deck and laughed,"
344,TWO GHOSTS,As only a glad ghost can;
345,TWO GHOSTS,"While a swooning soul was dragged to his goal,"
346,TWO GHOSTS,To work out the astral span.
347,TWO GHOSTS,
348,TWO GHOSTS,"And a woman wept, and prayed ere she slept,"
349,TWO GHOSTS,For a dream to ease her pain;
350,TWO GHOSTS,"But she dreamed instead of a man long dead,"
351,TWO GHOSTS,Who had loved her all in vain.

358,WOMAN,
359,WOMAN,Strange are the ways that her feet have trod
360,WOMAN,"Since first she was set in the path of duty,"
361,WOMAN,"Finished and fair by the hand of God,"
362,WOMAN,To carry her message of love and beauty.
363,WOMAN,"Delicate creature of light and shade,"
364,WOMAN,"She gleamed like an opal, on wide worlds under:"
365,WOMAN,"And earth looked up to her half afraid,"
366,WOMAN,"While heaven looked down at her, full of wonder."
367,WOMAN,
368,WOMAN,"Flame of the comet and mist of the moon,"
369,WOMAN,And ray of the sun all mingled in her.
370,WOMAN,And the heart of her asked but a single boon—
371,WOMAN,"That love should seek her, and find her, and win her."
372,WOMAN,She grasped the scope of the First Intent

1654,THE AWAKENING,"I love the tropics, where sun and rain"
1655,THE AWAKENING,"Go forth together, a joyous train,"
1656,THE AWAKENING,"To hold up the green, gay side of the world,"
1657,THE AWAKENING,And to keep earth’s banners of bloom unfurled.
1658,THE AWAKENING,
1659,THE AWAKENING,I love the scents that are hidden there
1660,THE AWAKENING,"By housekeeper Time, in her chests of air:"
1661,THE AWAKENING,"Strange and subtle and all a-rife,"
1662,THE AWAKENING,With vague lost dreams of a bygone life.
1663,THE AWAKENING,
1664,THE AWAKENING,"They steal upon you by night and day,"
1665,THE AWAKENING,But never a whiff can you take away:

1667,THE AWAKENING,Outside of its palm-decked land is heard.
1668,THE AWAKENING,
1669,THE AWAKENING,And nowhere else can you know the sweet
1670,THE AWAKENING,"Soft, ‘joy-in-nothing,’ that comes with the heat"
1671,THE AWAKENING,"Of tropic regions.  And yet, and yet,"
1672,THE AWAKENING,If in evergreen worlds my way were set
1673,THE AWAKENING,
1674,THE AWAKENING,I would span the waters of widest seas
1675,THE AWAKENING,To see the wonder of waking trees;
1676,THE AWAKENING,To feel the shock of sudden delight
1677,THE AWAKENING,"That comes when the orchard has changed in a night,"
1678,THE AWAKENING,"From the winter nun to the bride of May,"
1679,THE AWAKENING,And the harp of Spring is attuned to play
1680,THE AWAKENING,"The wedding march, and the sun is priest,"

1682,THE AWAKENING,
1683,THE AWAKENING,"Oh, never is felt in a tropic clime,"
1684,THE AWAKENING,"Where the singing of birds is a ceaseless chime,"
1685,THE AWAKENING,"That leap o’ the blood, and the rapture thrill,"
1686,THE AWAKENING,"That comes to us here, with the first bird’s trill;"
1687,THE AWAKENING,And only the eye that has looked on snows
1688,THE AWAKENING,Can see the beauty that lies in a rose.
1689,THE AWAKENING,"The lure of the tropics I understand,"

1731,NIRVANA,"Forgot its cause, and spake with deep emotion"
1732,NIRVANA,Unto a passing breeze.  ‘How desolate
1733,NIRVANA,And all forlorn is my unhappy fate.
1734,NIRVANA,"I know not whence I came, or where I go."
1735,NIRVANA,"Scorched by the sun, or chilled by winds that blow,"

1745,NIRVANA,
1746,NIRVANA,"It lived, it moved, it was a joyous part"
1747,NIRVANA,Of that strong palpitating ocean heart;
1748,NIRVANA,Its little dream of loneliness was done;
1749,NIRVANA,"It woke to find, Self, and Cause, were one."
1750,NIRVANA,"So shalt thou wake, sad mortal, when thy course"
1751,NIRVANA,"Has run its karmic round, and reached the Source,"

2079,FATHER,"He was honest, and unpurchable and kind;"
2080,FATHER,"He was clean in heart, and body, and in mind."
2081,FATHER,So he made them heirs to riches without price—
2082,FATHER,This father.
2083,FATHER,
2084,FATHER,He never preached or scolded; and the rod—
2085,FATHER,"Well, he used it as a turning pole in play."
2086,FATHER,But he showed the tender sympathy of God
2087,FATHER,"To his children in their troubles, and their joys."
2088,FATHER,"He was always chum and comrade with his boys,"
2089,FATHER,"And his daughters—oh, you ought to hear them say"
2090,FATHER,‘Father.’
2091,FATHER,
2092,FATHER,Now I think of all achievements ’tis the least
2093,FATHER,To perpetuate the species; it is done
2094,FATHER,"By the insect and the serpent, and the beast."
2095,FATHER,"But the man who keeps his body, and his thought,"
2096,FATHER,"_Worth_ bestowing on an offspring love-begot,"
2097,FATHER,"Then the highest earthly glory he has won,"
