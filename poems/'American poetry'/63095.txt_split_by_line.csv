40,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,_QUARTZ from the UPLANDS_
41,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
42,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
43,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Who Say? “All songs have been sung;
44,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,All tales have been told;
45,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Live tongues are still’d--
46,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Worn smooth by precedent!”
47,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
48,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,In the fullness of the soul
49,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,There lives--strong bound--
50,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Only to be unloos’d by greater deed and action;
51,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,An unfathomable wealth
52,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,From which to draw forever--
53,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Never to be wholly used.
54,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
55,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Is it for you
56,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,To stand at the bier of the dead past
57,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Mute--to consent, that:"
58,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,“All! has been sung and writ”?
59,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
60,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"No! Insistingly, Persistently beat loud upon the temple"
61,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,door--steeled well to hear the mock and din and laughter
62,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"and deriding, doubting shouts of those within,"
63,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,That you may full awake the throng without--
64,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Those who sleep, work, hope and pray."
65,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"You must proclaim again, again,"
66,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,This Truth!
67,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"The multitude at last will stand aghast, amazed, ashamed;"
68,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Thy liberty deny,"
69,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Yea, crucify."
70,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
71,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"To them:--What is, is; and what is, is to remain unchanged forever."
72,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
73,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"To learn the lesson, to equip and grade thy purging fire;"
74,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Go forth to some unfrequented spot
75,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"And reason with thyself, comparing notes with Nature."
76,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
77,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,See it. Feel it. Hear it.
78,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"The all-prevailing, pervading, constant, ever changing. From"
79,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Winter’s silence, breathing, sighing, sleeping, creeping"
80,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"on to Spring with sap, with shoot, with bud and flower,"
81,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"hour on hour playing, plying gentleness and power for Summer’s"
82,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"rest to temper strength for birth in Autumn, with crowning"
83,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"brilliancy and rich rewards untaxed to bird, to beast, to"
84,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"insect and to man, gift on gift for full contentment,"
85,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,sustenance and labor.
86,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
87,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"From this you will accumulate a store so full,"
88,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,That every thought’s a prayer;
89,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,The simplest acts of things are miracles--
90,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"The whole a revelation,"
91,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,To guide thy way and being.
92,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
93,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Kill not, dissect not, nor rend or tear,"
94,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,But see and feel and hear.
95,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
96,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"The earth, the air and sea abound"
97,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"With righteous living creatures,"
98,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Intent upon some full purpose;--
99,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Aside from man’s estate,"
100,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Aside from his designing selfishness, intensely useless"
101,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"graspings, destruction, purposeless desire,"
102,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"For his good use and keeping,"
103,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"The forest, field and sea"
104,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,And all that lies beneath.
105,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
106,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,But if to be a “Bard Sublime?”--
107,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"A prater,"
108,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Aspiring to soar ’midst lofty peaks on painted scenes; to
109,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,catch with musty mystery; with empty schemes of praise;
110,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"with sheens of artificial light, spread o’er this prolonged"
111,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,night and sleep of letters; or with palsied moonbeams that
112,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,miniature the day and blight tart speech and full-ripe reason;
113,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,To buoy vanity;
114,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"To bid for foolish charlatan’s esteem,"
115,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"To live apart at ease and shirk,"
116,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Good hard holy healthy work;
117,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"To mingle not with clean magnetic dirt,"
118,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"With healing, building sunshine, air and rain.--"
119,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Then be a heralder of “New Thought”
120,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Cite from thy store:
121,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Great Deeds
122,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,And haughty interminglings;
123,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Praise, to have a share;"
124,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Valor, in which words win;"
125,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Chastisement, which you do not feel;"
126,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Abnegation, with no self-denial."
127,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
128,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Whatever thy saying,"
129,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Mark you full well
130,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,That all such machinations
131,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Must and will be counted less
132,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Than Brawn-Studies in great Nature’s realm.
133,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
134,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,If swept away from Nature’s gentle sway
135,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Too weak to rise and understand
136,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Thy full purpose, and the coming day:--"
137,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Then feed, feed on thy kind and kith and kin"
138,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Plunge in, into the maelstrom;"
139,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Amidst the deaf’ning roar,"
140,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Swim ’midst molten masses,"
141,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Breast cataracts of seething, living action,"
142,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Tell of harnessing of power,"
143,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Of screech and scream,"
144,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Of whirr of wheels;
145,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Of lightning’s use and speed;
146,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Of clank and bang and whisp and twirl of rasp and
147,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,plane and drill on rock and wood and metal.
148,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"For therein lies a ripe, rich, unwrit story;"
149,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,And place the credit where the credit’s due.
150,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Use freely, and without fear thy caustic pen,"
151,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Ruffle, ruthlessly pursue, dog and undo"
152,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Proud spirited, designing men."
153,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
154,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Spur the laggard.
155,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
156,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Jeer at that part of press which teems with
157,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"misstatements, lies, inuendos--"
158,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Those who prod and sting;
159,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Excite the very life they claim to be,"
160,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"For gain,"
161,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"For great and greater power, circulation."
162,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
163,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"A song or story to go on, up, through distant ages"
164,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Must be full told and strong with facts:--
165,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
166,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Tell of myriads of human beings,"
167,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Crushed, dwarfed, poisoned and devoured,"
168,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,By the arts and manufactures;
169,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Voices drown’d, subdued, smothered amid the din."
170,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
171,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Tell of the march of industry’s deafening roar
172,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,affecting a nation’s reasoning and sealing its
173,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,store of finest instincts.
174,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
175,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Tell of designing kings of trade
176,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Who, on a _free man’s_ soil!"
177,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,So multiplied their wealth
178,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,That all their fellow-beings
179,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Were their _willing_ slave--
180,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Slaves living lives in imputrid bodies--
181,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Souls seasoned with sorrows and blasted hopes;
182,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Of endless yesterdays,"
183,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Long looking and longing and looking
184,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"For happiness, to come on some to-morrow."
185,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
186,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Tell of serfs, dumb,"
187,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Blind and starved by greed;
188,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Ground ’twixt its own mill-stones;
189,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Prating prayers to God
190,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,While God looks on amazed
191,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,At supine strength
192,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Behind these wills and souls inactive.
193,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
194,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Bound to an unjust cause;
195,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Held firm by statute and multiplying laws.
196,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
197,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Tell how they bound themselves:
198,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,For paltry bits of food--
199,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,For half-made clothes--
200,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,And shacks for shelter
201,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"For which they gave full rights to use Man’s Acre,"
202,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,And all the treasures that lie beneath.
203,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
204,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Tell of rampant selfishness run riot;
205,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Of countless serfs--
206,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,The earth’s scum;
207,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Floating to this _free_ land
208,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,To climb upon it and gorge on gold _galore_;
209,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,With inspirations only of eternal happiness in idleness;
210,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Playing wanton parts;
211,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Dragging in their brazened gods and images;
212,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Feeding on rotten greed;
213,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Loaded with besotted vices
214,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Practising stupid customs,"
215,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"These, all these--"
216,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"With voice and vote,--"
217,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"To sweep aside the well devised purpose,"
218,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Built by patriarchs for _equal_ rights and honors.
219,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
220,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"They came, to make a Nation of all nations--"
221,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"But after all, no nation,"
222,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,No man’s land.
223,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
224,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Tell of poisoned, delayed and decayed food in transit."
225,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
226,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Tell of the settlement of nations’ differences
227,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"By “good offices” for peace,"
228,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"With long--drawn--out, decrepit, verbose, empty ceremony."
229,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
230,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Of International Law--
231,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,The Will of Power.
232,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
233,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Of nations, swearing by the “Prince of Peace”"
234,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Continuing to fortify with great and greater guns,"
235,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Mobilizing husbands to defeat husbandry;
236,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Bedecking them with gilt without,"
237,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Stuffing vanity and pompousness within.
238,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
239,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"But, if you see through the roseate glass,"
240,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Of swaggering optimism
241,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Proclaim, that:--"
242,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,“‘God is working out His will’--
243,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Too slow perhaps
244,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,For challengers of spotted vice;
245,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,For those who seek for the world’s and the Nation’s
246,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"failings, inhuman sloth, stubbornness and sin.”"
247,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
248,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Whatever thy chronicle,"
249,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Let it not savor of a full stomach’s satisfaction
250,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,That feels content with ill-got gain derived from tricks of trade.
251,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,
252,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Live amidst conditions on both sides;
253,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Experience the chill and pinch of poverty;
254,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Feel the cold steel bands about an undeveloped soul;
255,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Want for tools and an opportunity to do some useful chosen work,"
256,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Then will you write full well,"
257,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Write strong thy story,"
258,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,Chronicling on golden pages;
259,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,"Infinite views,"
260,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,To march to triumph with the Truth of Truths;
261,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,’Twill live on and up and through
262,AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY,The distant ages.
