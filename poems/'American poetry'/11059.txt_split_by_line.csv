60,,"As it may be objected to the following Poem, that some of the images there"
61,,"introduced are not wholly peculiar to the Season described, the Author"
62,,"begs leave to state, that, both in their selection and disposition, he was"
63,,"guided by that, which, in his limited experience, was found to be the"
64,,"Season of their greatest impression: and, though he has not always felt"
65,,the necessity of pointing out the collateral causes by which the effect
66,,"was increased, he yet flatters himself that, in general, they are"
67,,"sufficiently implied either by what follows or precedes them. Thus, for"
68,,"instance, the _running brook_, though by no means peculiar, is"
69,,appropriated to Spring; as affording by its motion and _seeming_
70,,exultation one of the most lively images of that spirit of renovation
71,,which animates the earth after its temporary suspension during the Winter.
72,,"By the same rule, is assigned to Summer the _placid lake_, &c. not because"
73,,"that image is never seen, or enjoyed, at any other season; but on account"
74,,"of its affecting us more in Summer, than either in the Spring, or in"
75,,Autumn; the indolence and languor generally then experienced disposing us
76,,"to dwell with particular delight on such an object of repose, not to"
77,,mention the grateful idea of coolness derived from a knowledge of its
78,,"temperature. Thus also the _evening cloud_, exhibiting a fleeting"
79,,"representation of successive objects, is, perhaps, justly appropriated to"
80,,"Autumn, as in that Season the general decay of inanimate nature leads the"
81,,"mind to turn upon itself, and without effort to apply almost every image"
82,,"of sense or vision of the imagination,* to its own transitory state."
83,,
84,,"If the above be admitted, it is needless to add more; if it be not, it"
85,,would be useless.

90,,The Sylphs of the Seasons.
91,,
92,,
93,,
94,,Long has it been my fate to hear
95,,"The slave of Mammon, with a sneer,"
96,,My indolence reprove.
97,,"Ah, little knows he of the care,"
98,,"The toil, the hardship that I bear,"
99,,"While lolling in my elbow-chair,"
100,,And seeming scarce to move:
101,,
102,,"For, mounted on the Poet's steed,"
103,,I _there_ my ceaseless journey speed
104,,"O'er mountain, wood, and stream:"
105,,And oft within a little day
106,,"'Mid comets fierce 'tis mine to stray,"
107,,And wander o'er the Milky-way
108,,To catch a Poet's dream.
109,,
110,,But would the Man of Lucre know
111,,What riches from my labours flow?--
112,,A DREAM is my reply.
113,,"And who for wealth has ever pin'd,"
114,,"That had a World within his mind,"
115,,"Where every treasure he may find,"
116,,And joys that never die!
117,,
118,,"One night, my task diurnal done,"
119,,(For I had travell'd with the Sun
120,,"O'er burning sands, o'er snows)"
121,,"Fatigued, I sought the couch of rest;"
122,,My wonted pray'r to Heaven address'd;
123,,But scarce had I my pillow press'd
124,,When thus a vision rose.
125,,
126,,"Methought within a desert cave,"
127,,"Cold, dark, and solemn as the grave,"
128,,I suddenly awoke.
129,,"It seem'd of sable Night the cell,"
130,,"Where, save when from the ceiling fell"
131,,"An oozing drop, her silent spell"
132,,No sound had ever broke.
133,,
134,,"There motionless I stood alone,"
135,,Like some strange monument of stone
136,,Upon a barren wild;
137,,"Or like, (so solid and profound"
138,,The darkness seem'd that wall'd me round)
139,,"A man that's buried under ground,"
140,,Where pyramids are pil'd.
141,,
142,,"Thus fix'd, a dreadful hour I past,"
143,,"And now I heard, as from a blast,"
144,,A voice pronounce my name:
145,,"Nor long upon my ear it dwelt,"
146,,When round me 'gan the air to melt.
147,,And motion once again I felt
148,,Quick circling o'er my frame.
149,,
150,,"Again it call'd; and then a ray,"
151,,"That seem'd a gushing fount of day,"
152,,Across the cavern stream'd.
153,,"Half struck with terror and delight,"
154,,"I hail'd the little blessed light,"
155,,And follow'd 'till my aching sight
156,,An orb of darkness seem'd.
157,,
158,,Nor long I felt the blinding pain;
159,,For soon upon a mountain plain
160,,I gaz'd with wonder new.
161,,There high a castle rear'd its head;
162,,"And far below a region spread,"
163,,Where every Season seem'd to shed
164,,Its own peculiar hue.
165,,
166,,"Now at the castle's massy gate,"
167,,"Like one that's blindly urged by fate,"
168,,A bugle-horn I blew.
169,,"The mountain-plain it shook around,"
170,,"The vales return'd a hollow sound,"
171,,"And, moving with a sigh profound."
172,,The portals open flew.
173,,
174,,"Then ent'ring, from a glittering hall"
175,,"I heard a voice seraphic call,"
176,,"That bade me ""ever reign,"
177,,"All hail!"" it said in accent wild,"
178,,"""For thou art Nature's chosen child,"
179,,"Whom wealth nor blood has e'er defil'd,"
180,,"Hail, Lord of this Domain!"""
181,,
182,,"And now I paced a bright saloon,"
183,,"That seem'd illumin'd by the moon,"
184,,So mellow was the light.
185,,"The walls with jetty darkness teem'd,"
186,,"While down them chrystal columns streamed,"
187,,And each a mountain torrent seem'd.
188,,High-flashing through the night.
189,,
190,,"Rear'd in the midst, a double throne."
191,,Like burnish'd cloud of evening shone;
192,,"While, group'd the base around,"
193,,Four Damsels stood of Faery race;
194,,"Who, turning each with heavenly grace"
195,,"Upon me her immortal face,"
196,,Transfix'd me to the ground.
197,,
198,,And _thus_ the foremost of the tram:
199,,"Be thine the throne, and thine to reign"
200,,O'er all the varying year!
201,,But ere thou rulest the Fates command;
202,,That of our chosen rival band
203,,"A Sylph shall win thy heart and hand,"
204,,Thy sovereignty to share.
205,,
206,,"For we, the sisters of a birth,"
207,,Do rule by turns the subject earth
208,,To serve ungrateful man;
209,,But since our varied toils impart
210,,"No joy to his capricious heart,"
211,,'Tis now ordain'd that human art
212,,Shall rectify the plan.
213,,
214,,"Then spake the Sylph of Spring serene,"
215,,"'Tis _I_ thy joyous heart I ween,"
216,,With sympathy shall move:
217,,For I with living melody
218,,"Of birds in choral symphony,"
219,,"First wak'd thy soul to poesy,"
220,,To piety and love.
221,,
222,,"When thou, at call of vernal breeze,"
223,,"And beck'ning bough of budding trees,"
224,,Hast left thy sullen fire;
225,,And stretch'd thee in some mossy dell.
226,,"And heard the browsing wether's bell,"
227,,Blythe echoes rousing from their cell
228,,To swell the tinkling quire:
229,,
230,,Or heard from branch of flow'ring thorn
231,,The song of friendly cuckoo warn
232,,The tardy-moving swain;
233,,Hast bid the purple swallow hail;
234,,"And seen him now through ether sail,"
235,,Now sweeping downward o'er the vale.
236,,And skimming now the plain;
237,,
238,,"Then, catching with a sudden glance"
239,,The bright and silver-clear expanse
240,,Of some broad river's stream.
241,,"Beheld the boats adown it glide,"
242,,"And motion wind again the tide,"
243,,"Where, chain'd in ice by Winter's pride,"
244,,Late roll'd the heavy team:
245,,
246,,"Or, lur'd by some fresh-scented gale,"
247,,That woo'd the moored fisher's sail
248,,"To tempt the mighty main,"
249,,"Hast watch'd the dim receding shore,"
250,,"Now faintly seen the ocean o'er,"
251,,"Like hanging cloud, and now no more"
252,,To bound the sapphire plain;
253,,
254,,"Then, wrapt in night the scudding bark,"
255,,"(That seem'd, self-pois'd amid the dark,"
256,,"Through upper air to leap,)"
257,,"Beheld, from thy most fearful height,"
258,,Beneath the dolphin's azure light
259,,"Cleave, like a living meteor bright,"
260,,The darkness of the deep:
261,,
262,,"'Twas mine the warm, awak'ning hand"
263,,"That made thy grateful heart expand,"
264,,And feel the high control
265,,"Of Him, the mighty Power, that moves"
266,,"Amid the waters and the groves,"
267,,And through his vast creation proves
268,,His omnipresent soul.
269,,
270,,"Or, brooding o'er some forest rill,"
271,,"Fring'd with the early daffodil,"
272,,"And quiv'ring maiden-hair,"
273,,"When thou hast mark'd the dusky bed,"
274,,"With leaves and water-rust o'erspread,"
275,,That seem'd an amber light to shed
276,,On all was shadow'd there;
277,,
278,,"And thence, as by its murmur call'd,"
279,,The current traced to where it brawl'd
280,,Beneath the noontide ray;
281,,And there beheld the checquer'd shade
282,,"Of waves, in many a sinuous braid,"
283,,"That o'er the sunny channel play'd,"
284,,With motion ever gay:
285,,
286,,"'Twas I to these the magick gave,"
287,,"That made thy heart, a willing slave,"
288,,To gentle Nature bend;
289,,"And taught thee how with tree and flower,"
290,,"And whispering gale, and dropping shower,"
291,,"In converse sweet to pass the hour,"
292,,As with an early friend:
293,,
294,,That mid the noontide sunny haze
295,,Did in thy languid bosom raise
296,,The raptures of the boy;
297,,"When, wak'd as if to second birth,"
298,,"Thy soul through every pore look'd forth,"
299,,And gaz'd upon the beauteous Earth
300,,With myriad eyes of joy:
301,,
302,,"That made thy heart, like HIS above,"
303,,To flow with universal love
304,,For every living thing.
305,,"And, oh! if I, with ray divine,"
306,,"Thus tempering, did thy soul refine,"
307,,"Then let thy gentle heart be mine,"
308,,And bless the Sylph of Spring.
309,,
310,,And next the Sylph of Summer fair;
311,,"The while her crisped, golden hair"
312,,Half veil'd her sunny eyes:
313,,"Nor less may _I_ thy homage claim,"
314,,At touch of whose exhaling flame
315,,The fog of Spring that chill'd thy frame
316,,In genial vapour flies.
317,,
318,,"Oft by the heat of noon opprest,"
319,,"With flowing hair and open vest,"
320,,Thy footsteps have I won
321,,"To mossy couch of welling grot,"
322,,Where thou hast bless'd thy happy lot.
323,,That thou in that delicious spot
324,,"May'st see, not feel, the sun:"
325,,
326,,"Thence tracing from the body's change,"
327,,"In curious philosophic range,"
328,,The motion of the mind;
329,,"And how from thought to thought it flew,"
330,,Still hoping in each vision new
331,,"The faery land of bliss to view,"
332,,But ne'er that land to find.
333,,
334,,"And then, as grew thy languid mood,"
335,,To some embow'ring silent wood
336,,I led thy careless way;
337,,Where high from tree to tree in air
338,,Thou saw'st the spider swing her snare.
339,,"So bright!--as if, entangled there,"
340,,The sun had left a ray:
341,,
342,,Or lur'd thee to some beetling steep
343,,To mark the deep and quiet sleep
344,,That wrapt the tarn below;
345,,And mountain blue and forest green
346,,"Inverted on its plane serene,"
347,,Dim gleaming through the filmy sheen
348,,That glaz'd the painted show;
349,,
350,,"Perchance, to mark the fisher's skiff"
351,,Swift from beneath some shadowy cliff
352,,"Dart, like a gust of wind;"
353,,"And, as she skimm'd the sunny lake,"
354,,In many a playful wreath her wake
355,,"Far-trailing, like a silvery snake,"
356,,With sinuous length behind.
357,,
358,,Nor less when hill and dale and heath
359,,Still Evening wrapt in mimic death.
360,,Thy spirit true I prov'd:
361,,"Around thee, as the darkness stole,"
362,,"Before thy wild, creative soul"
363,,"I bade each faery vision roll,"
364,,Thine infancy had lov'd.
365,,
366,,"Then o'er the silent sleeping land,"
367,,"Thy fancy, like a magick wand,"
368,,Forth caird the Elfin race:
369,,And now around the fountain's brim
370,,In circling dance they gaily skim;
371,,"And now upon its surface swim,"
372,,And water-spiders chase;
373,,
374,,Each circumstance of sight or sound
375,,Peopling the vacant air around
376,,With visionary life:
377,,"For if amid a thicket stirr'd,"
378,,"Or flitting bat, or wakeful bird,"
379,,Then straight thy eager fancy heard
380,,The din of Faery strife;
381,,
382,,"Now, in the passing beetle's hum"
383,,The Elfin army's goblin drum
384,,To pigmy battle sound;
385,,"And now, where dripping dew-drops plash"
386,,"On waving grass, their bucklers clash,"
387,,"And now their quivering lances flash,"
388,,Wide-dealing death around:
389,,
390,,Or if the moon's effulgent form
391,,The passing clouds of sudden storm
392,,In quick succession veil;
393,,"Vast serpents now, their shadows glide,"
394,,"And, coursing now the mountain's side,"
395,,"A band of giants huge, they stride"
396,,"O'er hill, and wood, and dale."
397,,
398,,And still on many a service rare
399,,"Could I descant, if need there were,"
400,,My firmer claim to bind.
401,,But rest I most my high pretence
402,,"On that my genial influence,"
403,,Which made the body's indolence
404,,The vigour of the mind.
405,,
406,,"And now, in accents deep and low,"
407,,"Like voice of fondly-cherish'd woe,"
408,,The Sylph of Autumn sad:
409,,"Though I may not of raptures sing,"
410,,"That grac'd the gentle song of Spring,"
411,,"Like Summer, playful pleasures bring,"
412,,Thy youthful heart to glad;
413,,
414,,Yet still may I in hope aspire
415,,"Thy heart to touch with chaster fire,"
416,,And purifying love:
417,,"For I with vision high and holy,"
418,,"And spell of quick'ning melancholy,"
419,,Thy soul from sublunary folly
420,,First rais'd to worlds above.
421,,
422,,What though be mine the treasures fair
423,,"Of purple grape and yellow pear,"
424,,"And fruits of various hue,"
425,,"And harvests rich of golden grain,"
426,,That dance in waves along the plain
427,,"To merry song of reaping swain,"
428,,Beneath the welkin blue;
429,,
430,,"With these I may not urge my suit,"
431,,"Of Summer's patient toil the fruit,"
432,,For mortal purpose given:
433,,Nor may it fit my sober mood
434,,"To sing of sweetly murmuring flood,"
435,,"Or dies of many-colour'd wood,"
436,,That mock the bow of heaven.
437,,
438,,"But, know, 'twas mine the secret power"
439,,"That wak'd thee at the midnight hour,"
440,,In bleak November's reign:
441,,"'Twas I the spell around thee cast,"
442,,When thou didst hear the hollow blast
443,,"In murmurs tell of pleasures past,"
444,,That ne'er would come again:
445,,
446,,"And led thee, when the storm was o'er,"
447,,"To hear the sullen ocean roar,"
448,,By dreadful calm opprest;
449,,"Which still, though not a breeze was there,"
450,,"Its mountain-billows heav'd in air,"
451,,"As if a living thing it were,"
452,,That strove in vain for rest.
453,,
454,,"'Twas I, when thou, subdued by woe,"
455,,"Didst watch the leaves descending slow,"
456,,To each a moral gave;
457,,"And as they mov'd in mournful train,"
458,,"With rustling sound, along the plain,"
459,,Taught them to sing a seraph's strain
460,,Of peace within the grave.
461,,
462,,"And then uprais'd thy streaming eye,"
463,,I met thee in the western sky
464,,In pomp of evening cloud;
465,,"That, while with varying form it roll'd;"
466,,"Some wizard's castle seem'd of gold,"
467,,"And now a crimson'd knight of old,"
468,,Or king in purple proud.
469,,
470,,"And last, as sunk the setting sun,"
471,,"And Evening with her shadows dun,"
472,,"The gorgeous pageant past,"
473,,"'Twas then of life a mimic shew,"
474,,"Of human grandeur here below,"
475,,Which thus beneath the fatal blow
476,,Of Death must fall at last.
477,,
478,,"Oh, then with what aspiring gaze"
479,,Didst thou thy tranced vision raise
480,,"To yonder orbs on high,"
481,,"And think how wondrous, how sublime"
482,,"'Twere upwards to their spheres to climb,"
483,,"And live, beyond the reach of Time,"
484,,Child of Eternity!
485,,
486,,And last the Sylph of Winter spake;
487,,The while her piercing voice did shake
488,,The castle-vaults below.
489,,"Oh, youth, if thou, with soul refin'd,"
490,,"Hast felt the triumph pure of mind,"
491,,And learnt a secret joy to find
492,,In deepest scenes of woe;
493,,
494,,If e'er with fearful ear at eve
495,,Hast heard the wailing tempest grieve
496,,Through chink of shatter'd wall;
497,,The while it conjur'd o'er thy brain
498,,"Of wandering ghosts a mournful train,"
499,,"That low in fitful sobs complain,"
500,,Of Death's untimely call:
501,,
502,,"Or feeling, as the storm increas'd,"
503,,"The love of terror nerve thy breast,"
504,,Didst venture to the coast;
505,,To see the mighty war-ship leap
506,,"From wave to wave upon the deep,"
507,,"Like chamoise goat from steep to steep,"
508,,'Till low in valleys lost;
509,,
510,,"Then, glancing to the angry sky,"
511,,Behold the clouds with fury fly
512,,The lurid moon athwart;
513,,"Like armies huge in battle, throng,"
514,,"And pour in vollying ranks along,"
515,,While piping winds in martial song
516,,To rushing war exhort:
517,,
518,,"Oh, then to me thy heart be given,"
519,,"To me, ordain'd by Him in heaven"
520,,Thy nobler powers to wake.
521,,"And oh! if thou with poet's soul,"
522,,"High brooding o'er the frozen pole,"
523,,Hast felt beneath my stern control
524,,The desert region quake;
525,,
526,,"Or from old Hecla's cloudy height,"
527,,"When o'er the dismal, half-year's night"
528,,"He pours his sulph'rous breath,"
529,,Hast known my petrifying wind
530,,"Wild ocean's curling billows bind,"
531,,"Like bending sheaves by harvest hind,"
532,,Erect in icy-*death;
533,,
534,,Or heard adown the mountain's steep
535,,The northern blast with furious sweep
536,,Some cliff dissever'd dash;
537,,And seen it spring with dreadful bound
538,,"From rock to rock, to gulph profound,"
539,,While echoes fierce from caves resound
540,,The never-ending crash:
541,,
542,,"If thus, with terror's mighty spell"
543,,"Thy soul inspir'd, was wont to swell,"
544,,Thy heaving frame expand;
545,,"Oh, then to me thy heart incline;"
546,,"For know, the wondrous charm was mine"
547,,That fear and joy did thus combine
548,,In magick union bland.
549,,
550,,Nor think confin'd my native sphere
551,,"To horrors gaunt, or ghastly fear,"
552,,Or desolation wild:
553,,"For I of pleasures fair could sing,"
554,,"That steal from life its sharpest sting,"
555,,"And man have made around it cling,"
556,,Like mother to her child.
557,,
558,,"When thou, beneath the clear blue sky,"
559,,"So calm no cloud was seen to fly,"
560,,"Hast gaz'd on snowy plain,"
561,,"Where Nature slept so pure and sweet,"
562,,"She seem'd a corse in winding-sheet,"
563,,Whose happy soul had gone to meet
564,,The blest Angelic train;
565,,
566,,Or mark'd the sun's declining ray
567,,In thousand varying colours play
568,,"O'er ice-incrusted heath,"
569,,"In gleams of orange now, and green,"
570,,"And now in red and azure sheen,"
571,,"Like hues on dying dolphins seen,"
572,,Most lovely when in death;
573,,
574,,Or seen at dawn of eastern light
575,,The frosty toil of Fays by night
576,,"On pane of casement clear,"
577,,"Where bright the mimic glaciers shine,"
578,,"And Alps, with many a mountain pine,"
579,,And armed knights from Palestine
580,,In winding march appear:
581,,
582,,'Twas I on each enchanting scene
583,,The charm bestow'd that banished spleen
584,,Thy bosom pure and light.
585,,But still a _nobler_ power I claim;
586,,"That power allied to poets' fame,"
587,,Which language vain has dar'd to name--
588,,The soul's creative might.
589,,
590,,"Though Autumn grave, and Summer fair,"
591,,And joyous Spring demand a share
592,,"Of Fancy's hallow'd power,"
593,,"Yet these I hold of humbler kind,"
594,,"To grosser means of earth confin'd,"
595,,"Through mortal _sense_ to reach the mind,"
596,,"By mountain, stream, or flower."
597,,
598,,"But mine, of purer nature still,"
599,,Is _that_ which to thy secret will
600,,"Did minister unseen,"
601,,"Unfelt, unheard; when every sense"
602,,"Did sleep in drowsy indolence,"
603,,And Silence deep and Night intense
604,,Enshrowded every scene;
605,,
606,,That o'er thy teeming brain did raise
607,,The spirits of departed days[1]
608,,Through all the varying year;
609,,"And images of things remote,"
610,,"And sounds that long had ceas'd to float,"
611,,"With every hue, and every note,"
612,,As living now they were:
613,,
614,,And taught thee from the motley mass
615,,"Each harmonizing part to class,"
616,,(Like Nature's self employ'd;)
617,,"And then, as work'd thy wayward will,"
618,,"From these with rare combining skill,"
619,,With new-created worlds to fill
620,,Of space the mighty void.
621,,
622,,Oh then to me thy heart incline;
623,,To me whose plastick powers combine
624,,The harvest of the mind;
625,,"To me, whose magic coffers bear"
626,,"The spoils of all the toiling year,"
627,,That still in mental vision wear
628,,A lustre more refin'd.
629,,
630,,"She ceas'd--And now in doubtful mood,"
631,,"All motionless and mute I stood,"
632,,Like one by charm opprest:
633,,"By turns from each to each I rov'd,"
634,,And each by turns again I lov'd;
635,,For ages ne'er could one have prov'd
636,,More lovely than the rest.
637,,
638,,"""Oh blessed band, of birth divine,"
639,,"What mortal task is like to mine!""--"
640,,"And further had I spoke,"
641,,"When, lo! there pour'd a flood of light"
642,,"So fiercely on my aching sight,"
643,,"I fell beneath the vision bright,"
644,,And with the pain I woke.
645,,

649,,The Two Painters: _A Tale._
650,,
651,,
652,,
653,,Say why in every work of man
654,,Some imperfection mars the plan?
655,,Why join'd in every human art
656,,A perfect and imperfect part?
657,,Is it that life for art is short?
658,,Or is it nature's cruel sport?
659,,Or would she thus a moral teach;
660,,"That man should see, but never reach,"
661,,"The height of excellence, and show"
662,,The vanity of works below?
663,,"Or consequence of Pride, or Sloth;"
664,,Or rather the effect of both?
665,,"Whoe'er on life his eye has cast,"
666,,"I fear, alas, will say the last!"
667,,
668,,Once on a time in Charon's wherry
669,,"Two Painters met, on Styx's ferry."
670,,"Good sir, said one, with bow profound,"
671,,"I joy to meet thee under ground,"
672,,And though with zealous spite we strove
673,,"To blast each other's fame above,"
674,,"Yet here, as neither bay nor laurel"
675,,"Can tempt us to prolong our quarrel,"
676,,I hope the hand which I extend
677,,Will meet the welcome of a friend.
678,,"Sweet sir! replied the other Shade,"
679,,"While scorn on either nostril play'd,"
680,,Thy proffer'd love were great and kind
681,,Could I in thee a _rival_ find.--
682,,"rival, sir! returned the first,"
683,,"Ready with rising wind to burst,"
684,,"Thy meekness, sure, in this I see;"
685,,"We are not rivals, I agree:"
686,,And therefore am I more inclin'd
687,,"To cherish one of humble mind,"
688,,Who apprehends that one above him
689,,Can never condescend to love him.
690,,
691,,"Nor longer did their courteous guile,"
692,,"Like serpent, twisting through a smile,"
693,,"Each other sting in civil phrase,"
694,,And poison with envenom'd praise;
695,,"For now the fiend of anger rose,"
696,,"Distending each death-withered nose,"
697,,"And, rolling fierce each glassy eye,"
698,,"Like owlets' at the noonday sky,"
699,,Such flaming vollies pour'd of ire
700,,As set old Charon's phlegm on fire.
701,,"Peace! peace! the grizly boatman cried,"
702,,You drown the roar of Styx's tide;
703,,"Unmanner'd ghosts! if such your strife,"
704,,'Twere better you were still in life!
705,,If passions such as these you show
706,,You'll make another Earth below;
707,,"Which, sure, would be a viler birth,"
708,,Than if we made a Hell on Earth.
709,,At which in loud defensive strain
710,,'Gan speak the angry Shades again.
711,,"I'll hear no more, cried he; 'no more'"
712,,In echoes hoarse return'd the shore.
713,,"To Minos' court you soon shall hie,"
714,,(Chief Justice here) 'tis he will try
715,,"Your jealous cause, and prove at once"
716,,That only dunce can hate a dunce.
717,,
718,,"Thus check'd, in sullen mood they sped,"
719,,Nor more on either side was said;
720,,"Nor aught the dismal silence broke,"
721,,"Save only when the boatman's stroke,"
722,,"Deep-whizzing through the wave was heard,"
723,,"And now and then a spectre-bird,"
724,,"Low-cow'ring, with a hungry scream."
725,,For spectre-fishes in the stream.
726,,
727,,"Now midway pass'd, the creaking oar"
728,,Is heard upon the fronting shore;
729,,"Where thronging round in many a band,"
730,,The curious ghosts beset the strand.
731,,"Now suddenly the boat they 'spy,"
732,,Like gull diminish'd in the sky;
733,,"And now, like cloud of dusky white,"
734,,"Slow sailing o'er the deep of night,"
735,,The sheeted group within the bark
736,,Is seen amid the billows dark.
737,,Anon the keel with grating sound
738,,They hear upon the pebbly ground.
739,,"And now with kind, officious hand,"
740,,They help the ghostly crew to land.
741,,
742,,What news? they cried with one accord
743,,"I pray you, said a noble lord,"
744,,Tell me if in the world above
745,,I still retain the people's love:
746,,"Or whether they, like us below,"
747,,The motives of a Patriot know?
748,,"And me inform, another said,"
749,,What think they of a Buck that's dead?
750,,"Have they discerned that, being dull,"
751,,I knock'd my wit from watchmen's skull?
752,,"And me, cried one, of knotty front,"
753,,With many a scar of pride upon't
754,,Resolve me if the world opine
755,,Philosophers are still divine;
756,,"That having hearts for friends too small,"
757,,"Or rather having none at all,"
758,,"Profess'd to love, with saving grace,"
759,,The _abstract_ of the human race?
760,,"And I, exclaim'd a fourth, would ask"
761,,What think they of the Critick's task?
762,,Perceive they now our shallow arts;
763,,That merely from the want of parts
764,,"To write ourselves, we gravely taught"
765,,How books by others should be wrought?
766,,"Whom interrupting, then inquir'd"
767,,"A fifth, in squalid garb attir'd,"
768,,Do now the world with much regard
769,,"In mem'ry hold the dirty Bard,"
770,,Who credit gain'd for genius rare
771,,By shabby coat and uncomb'd hair?
772,,"Or do they, said a Shade of prose,"
773,,"With many a pimple's ghost on nose,"
774,,"Th' eccentric author still admire,"
775,,"Who wanting that same genius' fire,"
776,,"Diving in cellars underground,"
777,,In pipe the spark ethereal found:
778,,"Which, fann'd by many a ribbald joke,"
779,,"From brother tipplers puff'd in smoke,"
780,,"Such blaze diffused with crackling loud,"
781,,As blinded all the staring croud?
782,,"And last, with jealous glancing eye,"
783,,"That seem'd in all around to pry,"
784,,"A Painter's ghost in voice suppres'd,"
785,,"Thus questioning, the group address'd;"
786,,
787,,"Sweet strangers, may I too demand,"
788,,How thrive the offspring of my hand?
789,,"Whether, as when in life I flourish'd,"
790,,They still by puffs of fame are nourish'd?
791,,Or whether have the world discern'd
792,,The tricks by which my fame was earn'd;
793,,"That, lacking in my pencil skill,"
794,,I made my tongue its office fill:
795,,"That, marking (as for love of truth)"
796,,"In others' works a limb uncouth,"
797,,"Or face too young, or face too old,"
798,,"Or colour hot, or colour cold;"
799,,"Or hinting, (if to praise betray'd)"
800,,"'Though coloured well, it yet might _fade_;'"
801,,"And 'though its grace I can't deny,"
802,,Yet pity 'tis so hard and dry.'--
803,,I thus by implication show'd
804,,That mine were wrought in better mode;
805,,"And talking thus superiors down,"
806,,Obliquely raise my own renown?
807,,"In short, I simply this would ask,--"
808,,If Truth has stript me of the mask;
809,,"And, chasing Fashion's mist away,"
810,,Expos'd me to the eye of day--[2]
811,,"A Painter false, without a heart,"
812,,"Who lov'd himself, and not his art?"
813,,
814,,"At which, with fix'd and fishy"
815,,The Strangers both express'd amaze.
816,,"Good Sir, said they, 'tis strange you dare"
817,,Such meanness of yourself declare.
818,,
819,,"Were I on earth, replied the Shade,"
820,,I never had the truth betray'd;
821,,For there (and I suspect like you)
822,,I ne'er had time myself to view.
823,,"Yet, knowing that 'bove all creation"
824,,"I held myself in estimation,"
825,,I deem'd that what I _lov'd_ the _best_
826,,Of every virtue was possess'd.
827,,"But _here_ in colours black and true,"
828,,"Men see themselves, who never knew"
829,,"Their motives in the worldly strife,"
830,,Or real characters through life.
831,,"And here, alas! I scarce had been"
832,,"A little day, when every sin"
833,,"That slumber'd in my living breast,"
834,,"By Minos rous'd from torpid rest,"
835,,"Like thousand adders, rushing out,"
836,,Entwin'd my shuddering limbs about.--
837,,"Oh, strangers, hear!--the truth I tell--"
838,,That fearful sight I saw was Hell.
839,,"And, oh I with what unmeasur'd wo"
840,,"Did bitterness upon me flow,"
841,,"When thund'ring through the hissing air,"
842,,I heard the sentence of Despair--
843,,'Now never hope from Hell to flee;
844,,Yourself is all the Hell you see!'--
845,,
846,,He ceas'd. But still with stubborn pride
847,,The Rival Shades each other eyed;
848,,"When, bursting with terrifick sound,"
849,,"The voice of Minos shook the ground,"
850,,"The startled ghosts on either side,"
851,,"Like clouds before the wind, divide;"
852,,"And leaving far a passage free,"
853,,"Each, conning his defensive plea,"
854,,With many a crafty lure for grace.
855,,The Painters onward hold their pace.
856,,"Anon before the Judgement Seat,"
857,,With sneer confronting sneer they meet:
858,,"And now in deep and awful strain,"
859,,"Piercing like fiery darts the brain,"
860,,"Thus Minos spake. Though I am he,"
861,,From whom no secret thought may flee;
862,,Who sees it ere the birth be known
863,,"To him, that claims it for his own;"
864,,Yet would I still with patience hear
865,,"What each may for himself declare,"
866,,That all in your defence may see
867,,The justice pure of my decree.--
868,,"But, hold!--It ill beseems my place"
869,,To hear debate in such a case:
870,,"Be therefore thou, Da Vinci's shade,"
871,,Who when on earth to men display'd
872,,The scattered powers of human kind
873,,In thy capacious soul combin'd;
874,,"Be thou the umpire of the strife,"
875,,And judge as thou wert still in life.
876,,
877,,"Thus bid, with grave becoming air,"
878,,Th' appointed judge assum'd the chair.
879,,"And now with modest-seeming air,"
880,,The rivals straight for speech prepare:
881,,"And thus, with hand upon his breast,"
882,,The Senior Ghost the Judge address'd:
883,,"The world, (if ought the world I durst"
884,,In this believe) did call me first
885,,"Of those, who by the magick play"
886,,"Of harmonizing colours, sway"
887,,"The gazer's sense with such surprise,"
888,,As make him disbelieve his eyes.
889,,"'Tis true that some of vision dim,"
890,,"Or squeamish taste, or pedant whim,"
891,,My works assail'd with narrow spite;
892,,"And, passing o'er my colour bright,"
893,,"Reproach'd me for my want of grace,"
894,,And silks and velvets out of place;
895,,"And vulgar form, and lame design,"
896,,"And want of character; in fine,"
897,,For lack of worth of every kind
898,,To charm or to enlarge the mind.
899,,"Now this, my Lord, as will appear,"
900,,"Was nothing less than malice sheer,"
901,,"To stab me, like assassins dark,"
902,,"Because I did not hit a mark,"
903,,At which (as I have hope of fame)
904,,I never once design'd to aim.
905,,For seeing that the life of man
906,,Was scarcely longer than a span;
907,,"And, knowing that the Graphic Art"
908,,Ne'er mortal master'd but _in part_;
909,,"I wisely deem'd 'twere labour vain,"
910,,Should I attempt the _whole_ to gain;
911,,"And therefore, with ambition high,"
912,,Aspir'd to reach what pleas'd the eye;
913,,"Which, truly, sir, must be confess'd,"
914,,A part that far excels the rest:
915,,"For if, as all the world agree,"
916,,'Twixt Painting and fair Poesy
917,,"The diff'rence in the mode be found,"
918,,"Of colour this, and that of sound,"
919,,"'Tis plain, o'er every other grace,"
920,,That colour holds the highest place;
921,,"As being that distinctive part,"
922,,Which bounds it from another art.
923,,"If therefore, with reproof severe"
924,,"I've galled my pigmy Rival here,"
925,,"'Twas only, as your Lordship knows,"
926,,Because his foolish envy chose
927,,To rank his classic forms of mud
928,,Above my wholesome flesh and blood.
929,,
930,,Thus ended parle the Senior Shade.
931,,"And now, as scorning to upbraid,"
932,,"With curving, _parabolick_ smile,"
933,,"Contemptuous, eying him the while,"
934,,"His Rival thus: 'Twere vain, my Lord,"
935,,To wound a gnat by spear or sword[3];
936,,"If therefore _I_, of greater might,"
937,,"Would meet this _thing_ in equal fight,"
938,,'Twere fit that I in size should be
939,,"As mean, diminutive, as he;"
940,,"Of course, disdaining to reply,"
941,,I pass the wretch unheeded by.
942,,But since your Lordship deigns to know
943,,"What I in my behalf may show,"
944,,"With due submission, I proclaim,"
945,,That few on earth have borne a name
946,,"More envied or esteem'd than mine,"
947,,"For grace, expression, and design,"
948,,"For manners true of every clime,"
949,,And composition's art sublime.
950,,"In academick lore profound,"
951,,"I boldly took that lofty ground,"
952,,"Which, as it rais'd me near the sky,"
953,,Was thence for vulgar eyes too high;
954,,"Or, if beheld, to them appear'd"
955,,By clouds of gloomy darkness blear'd.
956,,"Yet still that misty height I chose,"
957,,"For well I knew the world had those,"
958,,"Whose sight, by learning clear'd of rheum,"
959,,Could pierce with ease the thickest gloom.
960,,"Thus, perch'd sublime, 'mid clouds I wrought,"
961,,Nor heeded what the vulgar thought.
962,,"What, though with clamour coarse and rude"
963,,They jested on my colours crude;
964,,"Comparing with malicious grin,"
965,,"My drapery to bronze and tin,"
966,,"My flesh to brick and earthen ware,"
967,,And wire of various kinds my hair;
968,,Or (if a landscape-bit they saw)
969,,My trees to pitchforks crown'd with straw;
970,,"My clouds to pewter plates of thin edge,"
971,,And fields to dish of eggs and spinage;
972,,"Yet this, and many a grosser rub,"
973,,"Like fam'd Diogenes in tub,"
974,,"I bore with philosophic nerve,"
975,,"Nay, gladly bore; for, here observe,"
976,,"_'Twas that which gave to them offense,"
977,,Did constitute my excellence._
978,,"I see, my Lord, at this you stare:"
979,,Yet thus I'll prove it to a hair.--
980,,"As Mind and Body are distinct,"
981,,"Though long in social union link'd,"
982,,"And as the only power they boast,"
983,,Is merely at each other's cost;
984,,"If both should hold an equal station,"
985,,They'd both be kings without a nation:
986,,"If therefore, one would paint the Mind"
987,,"In partnership with Body join'd,"
988,,"And give to each an equal place,"
989,,"With each an equal truth and grace,"
990,,'Tis clear the picture could not fail
991,,To be without or head or tail.
992,,And therefore as the Mind alone
993,,"I chose should fill my graphick throne,"
994,,"To fix her pow'r beyond dispute,"
995,,I trampled Body under foot:
996,,"That is, in more prosaick dress,"
997,,"As I the passions would express,"
998,,And as they ne'er could be portray'd
999,,"Without the subject Body's aid,"
1000,,I show'd no more of that than merely
1001,,Sufficed to represent them clearly:
1002,,As thus--by simple means and pure
1003,,"Of light and shadow, and contour:"
1004,,"But since what mortals call complexion,"
1005,,Has with the mind no more connexion
1006,,"Than ethicks with a country dance,"
1007,,I left my col'ring all to chance;
1008,,Which oft (as I may proudly state)
1009,,"With Nature war'd at such a rate,"
1010,,As left no mortal hue or stain
1011,,"Of base, corrupting flesh, to chain"
1012,,"The Soul to Earth; but, free as light,"
1013,,E'en let her soar till out of sight.
1014,,
1015,,Thus spake the champion bold of mind;
1016,,And thus the Colourist rejoin'd:
1017,,"In truth, my Lord, I apprehend,"
1018,,"If I by _words_ with him contend,"
1019,,"My case is gone; far he, by gift"
1020,,"Of what is call'd the _gab_, can shift"
1021,,"The right for wrong, with such a sleight,"
1022,,That right seems wrong and wrong the right;
1023,,"Nay, by his twisting logick make"
1024,,A square the form of circle take.
1025,,"I therefore, with submission meet,"
1026,,In justice do your Grace intreat
1027,,"To let awhile your judgment pause,"
1028,,That _works_ not _words_ may plead our cause.
1029,,"Let Merc'ry then to Earth repair,"
1030,,"The works of both survey with care,"
1031,,"And hither bring the best of each,"
1032,,And save us further waste of speech.
1033,,
1034,,"Such fair demand, the Judge replied,"
1035,,Could not with justice be denied.
1036,,"Good Merc'ry, hence! I fly, my Lord,"
1037,,"The Courier said. And, at the word,"
1038,,"High-bounding, wings his airy flight"
1039,,So swift his form eludes the sight;
1040,,"Nor aught is seen his course to mark,"
1041,,Save when athwart the region dark
1042,,"His brazen helm is spied afar,"
1043,,Bright-trailing like a falling star.
1044,,
1045,,And now for minutes ten there stole
1046,,A silence deep o'er every soul--
1047,,"When, lo! again before them stands"
1048,,The courier's self with empty hands.
1049,,"Why, how is this? exclaim'd the twain;"
1050,,"Where are the _pictures_, sir? Explain!"
1051,,"Good sirs, replied the God of Post,"
1052,,"I scarce had reached the other coast,"
1053,,"When Charon told me, one he ferried"
1054,,Inform'd him they were dead and buried:
1055,,"Then bade me hither haste and say,"
1056,,Their ghosts were now upon the way.
1057,,In mute amaze the Painters stood.
1058,,"But soon upon the Stygian flood,"
1059,,"Behold! the spectre-pictures float,"
1060,,Like rafts behind the towing boat:
1061,,"Now reach'd the shore, in close array,"
1062,,"Like armies drill'd in Homer's day,"
1063,,"When marching on to meet the foe,"
1064,,"By bucklers hid from top to toe,"
1065,,"They move along the dusky fields,"
1066,,A grizly troop of painted shields:
1067,,"And now, arrived in order fair,"
1068,,A gallery huge they hang in air.
1069,,
1070,,The ghostly croud with gay surprize
1071,,Began to rub their stony eyes:
1072,,"Such pleasant lounge, they all averr'd,"
1073,,None saw since he had been interr'd;
1074,,"And thus, like connoisseurs on Earth,"
1075,,Began to weigh the pictures' worth:
1076,,But first (as deem'd of higher kind)
1077,,Examin'd they the works of _Mind_.[4]
1078,,Pray what is this? demanded one.--
1079,,"That, sir, is Phoebus, alias, Sun:"
1080,,A classick work you can't deny;
1081,,"The car and horses in the sky,"
1082,,"The clouds on which they hold their way,"
1083,,Proclaim him all the God of Day.
1084,,"Nay, learned sir, his dirty plight"
1085,,More fit beseems the God of Night.
1086,,"Besides, I cannot well divine"
1087,,How mud like this can ever shine.--
1088,,Then look at that a little higher.--
1089,,"I see 'tis Orpheus, by his lyre."
1090,,"The beasts that listening stand around,"
1091,,Do well declare the force of sound:
1092,,"But why the fiction thus reverse,"
1093,,And make the power of song a curse?
1094,,"The ancient Orpheus soften'd rocks,"
1095,,Yours changes living things to blocks.--
1096,,"Well, this you'll sure acknowledge fine,"
1097,,Parnassus' top with all the Nine.
1098,,"Ah, _there_ is beauty, soul and fire,"
1099,,And all that human wit inspire!--
1100,,"Good sir, you're right; for being stone,"
1101,,They're each to blunted wits a hone.
1102,,And what is that? inquir'd another.--
1103,,"That, sir, is Cupid and his Mother.--"
1104,,"What, Venus? sure it cannot be:"
1105,,That skin begrim'd ne'er felt the sea;
1106,,That Cupid too ne'er knew the sky;
1107,,"For lead, I'm sure, could never fly.--"
1108,,"I'll hear no more, the Painter said,"
1109,,"Your souls are, like your bodies, dead!"
1110,,
1111,,"With secret triumph now elate,"
1112,,His grinning Rival 'gan to prate.
1113,,"Oh, fie! my friends; upon my word,"
1114,,You're too severe: he should be _heard_;
1115,,"For _Mind_ can ne'er to glory reach,"
1116,,Without the usual aid of _speech_.
1117,,"If thus howe'er, you seal his doom,"
1118,,What hope have I unknown to Rome?
1119,,"But since the _truth_ be your dominion,"
1120,,I beg to hear your just opinion.
1121,,This picture then--which some have thought
1122,,By far the best I ever wrought--
1123,,Observe it well with critick ken;
1124,,'Tis Daniel in the Lion's Den.--
1125,,'Tis flesh itself! exclaim'd a Critick.
1126,,But why make Daniel paralytick?
1127,,His limbs and features are distorted.
1128,,And then his legs are badly sorted.
1129,,"'Tis true, a miracle you've hit,"
1130,,But not as told in Holy Writ;
1131,,"For there the miracle was braving,"
1132,,"With _bones unbroke_, the Lion's craving;"
1133,,But yours (what ne'er could man befall)
1134,,That he should _live with none at all_.--
1135,,"And pray, inquir'd another spectre,"
1136,,What Mufti's that at pious lecture?
1137,,"That's Socrates, condemned to die;"
1138,,"He next, in sable, standing by,"
1139,,"Is Galen[5], come to save his friend,"
1140,,"If possible, from such an end;"
1141,,"The other figures, group'd around,"
1142,,"His Scholars, wrapt in woe profound.--"
1143,,And am I like to this portray'd?
1144,,Exclaim'd the Sage's smiling Shade.
1145,,"Good Sir, I never knew before"
1146,,"That I a Turkish turban wore,"
1147,,"Or mantle hemm'd with golden stitches,"
1148,,Much less a pair of satin breeches;
1149,,"But as for him in sable clad,"
1150,,"Though wond'rous kind, 'twas rather mad"
1151,,"To visit one like me forlorn,"
1152,,So long before himself was born.
1153,,And what's the next? inquir'd a third;
1154,,A jolly blade upon my word!--
1155,,"'Tis Alexander, Philip's son,"
1156,,Lamenting o'er his battles won;
1157,,"That now his mighty toils are o'er,"
1158,,The world has nought to conquer more.
1159,,"At which, forth stalking from the host,"
1160,,Before them stood the Hero's Ghost--
1161,,"Was that, said he, my earthly form,"
1162,,The Genius of the battle-storm?
1163,,From top to toe the figure's Dutch!
1164,,"Alas, my friend, had I been such,"
1165,,"Had I that fat and meaty skull,"
1166,,"Those bloated cheeks, and eyes so dull,"
1167,,"That driv'ling mouth, and bottle nose,"
1168,,"Those shambling legs, and gouty toes;"
1169,,"Thus form'd to snore throughout the day,--"
1170,,And eat and drink the night away;
1171,,I ne'er had felt the fev'rish flame
1172,,That caus'd my bloody thirst for fame;
1173,,"Nor madly claim'd immortal birth,"
1174,,Because the vilest brute on Earth:
1175,,"And, oh! I'd not been doom'd to hear,"
1176,,"Still whizzing in my blister'd ear,"
1177,,"The curses deep, in damning peals,"
1178,,"That rose from 'neath my chariot wheels,"
1179,,When I along the embattled plain
1180,,With furious triumph crush'd the slain:
1181,,"I should not thus be doom'd to see,"
1182,,"In every shape of agony,"
1183,,"The victims of my cruel wrath,"
1184,,"For ever dying, strew my path;"
1185,,"The grinding teeth, the lips awry,"
1186,,"The inflated nose, the starting eye,"
1187,,"The mangled bodies writhing round,"
1188,,"Like serpents, on the bloody ground;"
1189,,I should not thus for ever seem
1190,,"A charnel house, and scent the steam"
1191,,"Of black, fermenting, putrid gore,"
1192,,Rank oozing through each burning pore;
1193,,"Behold, as on a dungeon wall,"
1194,,"The worms upon my body crawl,"
1195,,"The which, if I would brush away,"
1196,,"Around my clammy fingers play,"
1197,,"And, twining fast with many a coil,"
1198,,In loathsome sport my labor foil.
1199,,
1200,,"Enough! the frighted Painter cried,"
1201,,And hung his head in fallen pride.
1202,,
1203,,"Not so the other. He, of stuff"
1204,,"More stubborn, ne'er would cry enough;"
1205,,"But like a soundly cudgell'd oak,"
1206,,"More sturdy grew at every stroke,"
1207,,And thus again his ready tongue
1208,,With fluent logick would have rung:
1209,,"My Lord, I'll prove, or I'm a liar--"
1210,,"Whom interrupting then with ire,"
1211,,"Thus check'd the Judge: Oh, proud yet mean!"
1212,,And canst thou hope from me to screen
1213,,"Thy foolish heart, and o'er it spread"
1214,,A veil to cheat th' omniscient dead?
1215,,"And canst thou hope, as once on Earth,"
1216,,Applause to gain by specious worth;
1217,,Like those that still by sneer and taunt
1218,,Would prove pernicious what they want;
1219,,"And claim the mastership of Art,"
1220,,Because thou only know'st a _part_?
1221,,
1222,,"Had'st thou from Nature, not the Schools"
1223,,"Distorted by pedantic rules,"
1224,,"With patience wrought, such logic vain"
1225,,Had ne'er perverted thus thy brain:
1226,,For Genius never gave delight
1227,,By means of what offends the sight:
1228,,"Nor hadst thou deem'd, with folly mad,"
1229,,"Thou could'st to Nature's beauties _add_,"
1230,,By _taking from her that which gives
1231,,The best assurance that she lives;
1232,,"By imperfection give attraction,"
1233,,And multiply them by subtraction._
1234,,
1235,,"Did Raffaelle thus, whose honour'd ghost"
1236,,Is now Elysium's fairest boast?
1237,,Far diff'rent He. Though weak and lame
1238,,"In parts that gave to others fame,"
1239,,Yet sought not _he_ by such defect
1240,,To swindle praise for _wise neglect_
1241,,"Of _vulgar_ charms, that only _blind_"
1242,,The dazzled eye to those of Mind.
1243,,"By Heaven impressed with Genius' seal,"
1244,,"An eye to see, and heart to feel,"
1245,,"His soul through boundless Nature rov'd,"
1246,,"And seeing felt, and feeling lov'd."
1247,,But weak the power of mind at will
1248,,To give the hand the painter's skill;
1249,,"For mortal works, maturing slow,"
1250,,From patient care and labour flow:
1251,,"And hence restrain'd, his youthful hand"
1252,,Obey'd a master's dull command;
1253,,But soon with health his sickly style
1254,,From Leonardo learn'd to smile;
1255,,And now from Bonarroti caught
1256,,A nobler Form; and now it sought
1257,,"Of colour fair the magic spell,"
1258,,And trac'd her to the Friar's[6] cell.
1259,,"No foolish pride, no narrow rule"
1260,,"Enslav'd his soul; from every School,"
1261,,"Whatever fair, whatever grand,"
1262,,"His pencil, like a potent wand,"
1263,,"Transfusing, bade his canvass grace."
1264,,"Progressive thus, with giant pace."
1265,,"And energy no toil could tame,"
1266,,He climb'd the rugged mount of Fame:
1267,,"And soon had reach'd the summit bold,"
1268,,"When Death, who there delights to hold"
1269,,"His fatal watch, with envious blow"
1270,,Quick hurl'd him to the shades below.
1271,,
1272,,Thus check'd the Judge the champion vain
1273,,"Of _Classic Form_; and thus in strain,"
1274,,"By anger half and pity mov'd,"
1275,,The ghostly Colourist reprov'd.
1276,,"And what didst _Thou_ aspire to gain,"
1277,,"_Who_ dar'd'st the will of Jove arraign,"
1278,,That bounded thus within a span
1279,,The little life of little man;
1280,,With shallow art deriving thence
1281,,Excuses for thy indolence?
1282,,'Tis cant and hypocritic stuff!
1283,,The life of man is long enough:
1284,,For did he but the half improve
1285,,He would not quarrel thus with Jove.
1286,,
1287,,But most I marvel (if it be
1288,,That aught may wond'rous seem to me)
1289,,"That Jove's high Gift, your noble Art,"
1290,,"Bestow'd to raise Man's grov'ling heart,"
1291,,Refining with ethereal ray
1292,,"Each gross and selfish thought away,"
1293,,"Should pander turn of paltry pelf,"
1294,,Imprisoning each within himself;
1295,,"Or like a gorgeous serpent, be"
1296,,"Your splendid source of misery,"
1297,,"And, crushing with his burnish'd folds,"
1298,,Still narrower make your narrow souls.
1299,,
1300,,"But words can ne'er reform produce,"
1301,,In Ignorance and Pride obtuse.
1302,,"Then know, ye rain and foolish Pair!"
1303,,Your doom is fix'd a yoke to bear
1304,,"Like beasts on Earth; and, thus in tether,"
1305,,Five Centuries to paint together.
1306,,"If, thus by mutual labours join'd,"
1307,,"Your jarring souls should be combin'd,"
1308,,"The faults of each the other mending,"
1309,,The powers of both harmonious blending;
1310,,"Great Jove, perhaps, in gracious vein,"
1311,,May send your souls on Earth again;
1312,,Yet there One only Painter be;
1313,,For thus the eternal Fates decree:
1314,,"One Leg alone shall never run,"
1315,,Nor two Half-Painters make but One.

1548,,"What comes and goes we know not whence, or where;"
1549,,"A brilliant nothing out of something wrought,"
1550,,A mental vacuum by condensing thought.
1551,,
1552,,Behold Tortoso. There's a man of wit;
1553,,"To all things fitted, though for nothing fit;"
1554,,"Scourge of the world, yet crouching for a name,"
1555,,And honour bartering for the breath of fame:
1556,,"Born to command, and yet an arrant slave;"
1557,,Through too much honesty a seeming knave;
1558,,"At all things grasping, though on nothing bent,"
1559,,And ease pursuing e'en with discontent;
1560,,"Through Nature, Arts, and Sciences he flies,"
1561,,And gathers truth to manufacture lies.

1577,,"The noblest, rarest monument of taste!"
1578,,"So neatly too, the mutilations stand"
1579,,Like native errors of the artist's hand;

1800,,
1801,,
1802,,"Fair Ellen was long the delight of the young,"
1803,,No damsel could with her compare;
1804,,Her charms were the theme of the heart and the tongue.
1805,,"And bards without number in extacies sung,"
1806,,The beauties of Ellen the fair.
1807,,
1808,,"Yet cold was the maid; and tho' legions advanced,"
1809,,"All drill'd by Ovidean art,"
1810,,"And languish'd, and ogled, protested and danced,"
1811,,"Like shadows they came, and like shadows they glanced"
1812,,From the hard polish'd ice of her heart.
1813,,
1814,,Yet still did the heart of fair Ellen implore
1815,,A something that could not be found;
1816,,"Like a sailor she seem'd on a desolate shore,"
1817,,"With nor house, nor a tree, nor a sound but the roar"
1818,,Of breakers high dashing around.
1819,,
1820,,"From object to object still, still would she veer,"
1821,,"Though nothing, alas, could she find;"
1822,,"Like the moon, without atmosphere, brilliant and clear,"
1823,,"Yet doom'd, like the moon, with no being to cheer"
1824,,The bright barren waste of her mind.
1825,,
1826,,But rather than sit like a statue so still
1827,,"When the rain made her mansion a _pound_,"
1828,,"Up and down would she go, like the sails of a mill,"
1829,,"And pat every stair, like a woodpecker's bill,"
1830,,From the tiles of the roof to the ground.
1831,,
1832,,"One morn, as the maid from her casement inclin'd,"
1833,,"Pass'd a youth, with a frame in his hand."
1834,,The casement she clos'd--not the eye of her mind;
1835,,"For, do all she could, no, she could not be blind;"
1836,,Still before her she saw the youth stand.
1837,,
1838,,"""Ah, what can he do,"" said the languishing maid,"
1839,,"""Ah, what with that frame can he do?"""
1840,,"And she knelt to the Goddess of Secrets and pray'd,"
1841,,"When the youth pass'd again, and again he display'd"
1842,,The frame and a picture to view.
1843,,
1844,,"""Oh, beautiful picture!"" the fair Ellen cried,"
1845,,"""I must see thee again or I die."""
1846,,"Then under her white chin her bonnet she tied,"
1847,,"And after the youth and the picture she hied,"
1848,,"When the youth, looking back, met her eye."
1849,,
1850,,"""Fair damsel,"" said he (and he chuckled the while)"
1851,,"""This picture I see you admire:"
1852,,"Then take it, I pray you, perhaps 'twill beguile"
1853,,"Some moments of sorrow; (nay, pardon my smile)"
1854,,"Or, at least, keep you home by the fire."""
1855,,
1856,,Then Ellen the gift with delight and surprise
1857,,From the cunning young stripling receiv'd.
1858,,"But she knew not the poison that enter'd her eyes,"
1859,,When sparkling with rapture they gaz'd on her prize--
1860,,"Thus, alas, are fair maidens deceiv'd!"
1861,,
1862,,"'Twas a youth o'er the form of a statue inclin'd,"
1863,,And the sculptor he seem'd of the stone;
1864,,Yet he languished as tho' for its beauty he pin'd
1865,,And gaz'd as the eyes of the statue so blind
1866,,Reflected the beams of his own.
1867,,
1868,,Twas the tale of the sculptor Pygmalion of old;
1869,,"Fair Ellen remember'd, and sigh'd;"
1870,,"""Ah, could'st thou but lift from that marble so cold,"
1871,,"Thine eyes too imploring, thy arms should enfold,"
1872,,"And press me this day as thy bride."""
1873,,
1874,,"She said: when, behold, from the canvass arose"
1875,,"The youth, and he stepp'd from the frame:"
1876,,With a furious transport his arms did enclose
1877,,"The love-plighted Ellen: and, clasping, he froze"
1878,,The blood of the maid with his flame!
1879,,
1880,,She turn'd and beheld on each shoulder a wing.
1881,,"""Oh, heaven! cried she, who art thou?"""
1882,,"From the roof to the ground did his fierce answer ring,"
1883,,"As frowning, he thunder'd "" I am the PAINT-KING!"
1884,,"And mine, lovely maid, thou art now!"""
1885,,
1886,,Then high from the ground did the grim monster lift
1887,,The loud screaming maid like a blast;
1888,,"And he sped through the air like a meteor swift,"
1889,,"While the clouds, wand'ring by him, did fearfully drift"
1890,,To the right and the left as he pass'd.
1891,,
1892,,"Now suddenly sloping his hurricane flight,"
1893,,With an eddying whirl he descends;
1894,,"The air all below him becomes black as night,"
1895,,"And the ground where he treads, as if mov'd with affright,"
1896,,Like the surge of the Caspian bends.
1897,,
1898,,"""I am here!"" said the Fiend, and he thundering knock'd"
1899,,At the gates of a mountainous cave;
1900,,"The gates open flew, as by magick unlocked,"
1901,,"While the peaks of the mount, reeling to and fro, rock'd"
1902,,Like an island of ice on the wave.
1903,,
1904,,"""Oh, mercy!"" cried Ellen, and swoon'd in his arms,"
1905,,"But the PAINT-KING, he scoff'd at her pain."
1906,,"""Prithee, love,"" said the monster, ""what mean these alarms?"""
1907,,"She hears not, she sees not the terrible charms,"
1908,,That work her to horrour again.
1909,,
1910,,"She opens her lids, but no longer her eyes"
1911,,Behold the fair youth she would woo;
1912,,Now appears the PAINT-KING in his natural guise;
1913,,"His face, like a palette of villainous dies,"
1914,,"Black and white, red, and yellow, and blue."
1915,,
1916,,"On the skull of a Titan, that Heaven defied,"
1917,,"Sat the fiend, like the grito Giant Gog,"
1918,,"While aloft to his mouth a huge pipe he applied,"
1919,,"Twice as big as the Eddystone Lighthouse, descried"
1920,,As it looms through an easterly fog.
1921,,
1922,,"And anon, as he puff'd the vast volumes, were seen,"
1923,,"In horrid festoons on the wall,"
1924,,"Legs and arms, heads and bodies emerging between,"
1925,,"Like the drawing-room grim of the Scotch Sawney Beane,"
1926,,By the Devil dress'd out for a ball.
1927,,
1928,,"""Ah me!"" cried the Damsel, and fell at his feet."
1929,,"""Must I hang on these walls to be dried?"""
1930,,"""Oh, no!"" said the fiend, while he sprung from his seat,"
1931,,"""A far nobler fortune thy person shall meet;"
1932,,"Into paint will I grind thee, my bride!"""
1933,,
1934,,"Then, seizing the maid by her dark auburn hair,"
1935,,An oil jug he plung'd her within.
1936,,"Seven days seven nights, with the shrieks of despair,"
1937,,"Did Ellen in torment convulse the dun air,"
1938,,All covered with oil to the chin.
1939,,
1940,,On the morn of the eighth on a huge sable stone
1941,,"Then Ellen, all reeking, he laid;"
1942,,"With a rock for his muller he crush'd every bone,"
1943,,"But, though ground to jelly, still, still did she groan;"
1944,,For life had forsook not the maid.
1945,,
1946,,"Now reaching his palette, with masterly care"
1947,,Each tint on its surface he spread;
1948,,"The blue of her eyes, and the brown of her hair,"
1949,,"And the pearl and the white of her forehead so fair,"
1950,,And her lips' and her cheeks' rosy red.
1951,,
1952,,"Then, stamping his foot, did the monster exclaim,"
1953,,"""Now I brave, cruel Fairy, thy scorn!"""
1954,,When lo! from a chasm wide-yawning there came
1955,,"A light tiny chariot of rose-colour'd flame,"
1956,,By a team of ten glow-worms upborne.
1957,,
1958,,"Enthroned In the midst on an emerald bright,"
1959,,Fair Geraldine sat without peer;
1960,,"Her robe was a gleam of the first blush of light,"
1961,,"And her mantle the fleece of a noon-cloud white,"
1962,,And a beam of the moon was her spear.
1963,,
1964,,In an accent that stole on the still charmed air
1965,,"Like the first gentle language of Eve,"
1966,,Thus spake from her chariot the Fairy so fair:
1967,,"""I come at thy call, but, oh Paint-King, beware."
1968,,"Beware if again you deceive."""
1969,,
1970,,"""Tis true,"" said the monster, ""thou queen of my heart,"
1971,,Thy portrait I oft have essay'd;
1972,,Yet ne'er to the canvass could I with my art
1973,,The least of thy wonderful beauties impart;
1974,,And my failure with scorn you repaid.
1975,,
1976,,"""Now I swear by the light of the Comet-King's tail!"""
1977,,"And he tower'd with pride as he spoke,"
1978,,"""If again with these magical colours I fail,"
1979,,"The crater of Etna shall hence be my jail,"
1980,,And my food shall be sulphur and smoke.
1981,,
1982,,"""But if I succeed, then, oh, fair Geraldine!"
1983,,"Thy promise with justice I claim,"
1984,,"And thou, queen of Fairies, shalt ever be mine,"
1985,,The bride of my bed; and thy portrait divine
1986,,"Shall fill all the earth with my fame."""
1987,,
1988,,"He spake; when, behold, the fair Geraldine's form"
1989,,On the canvass enchantingly glow'd;
1990,,His touches--they flew like the leaves in a storm;
1991,,And the pure pearly white and the carnation warm
1992,,Contending in harmony flow'd;
1993,,
1994,,And now did the portrait a twin-sister seem
1995,,To the figure of Geraldine fair:
1996,,With the same _sweet_ expression did faithfully teem
1997,,Each muscle; each feature; in short not a gleam
1998,,Was lost of her beautiful hair.

2686,METASTASIO.,
2687,METASTASIO.,[1] In a late beautiful poem by Mr. Montgomery is the following lines
2688,METASTASIO.,"""_The spirits of departed hours_."" The Author, fearing that so singular a"
2689,METASTASIO.,coincidence of thought and language might subject him to the charge of
2690,METASTASIO.,"plagiarism, thinks it necessary to state that his poem was written long"
2691,METASTASIO.,before he had the pleasure of reading Mr. M.'s.
2692,METASTASIO.,
2693,METASTASIO.,[2] The Author would be sorry to have it supposed that he alludes here to
2694,METASTASIO.,"any individual; for he can say with truth, that such a character has never"
2695,METASTASIO.,fallen under his observation: much less would he be thought to reflect on
2696,METASTASIO.,"the Artists, as a class of men to which such baseness may be generally"
2697,METASTASIO.,"imputed. The case here is merely _supposed_, to shew how easily imbecility"
2698,METASTASIO.,and selfishness may pervert this most innocent of all arts to the vilest
2699,METASTASIO.,purposes. He may be allowed also to disclaim an opinion too generally
2700,METASTASIO.,"prevalent; namely, that envy and detraction are the natural offspring of"
2701,METASTASIO.,"the art. That Artists should possess a portion of these vices, in common"
2702,METASTASIO.,"with Poets, Musicians, and other candidates for fame, is reasonably to be"
2703,METASTASIO.,"expected; but that they should exclusively monopolise them, or even hold"
2704,METASTASIO.,"an undue proportion, 'twere ungenerous to suppose. The Author has known"
2705,METASTASIO.,"Artists in various countries; and can truly say, that, with a very few"
2706,METASTASIO.,"exceptions, he has found them candid and liberal; prompt to discover"
2707,METASTASIO.,"merit, and just in applauding it. If there have been exceptions, he has"
2708,METASTASIO.,also generally been able to trace their cause to the unpropitious
2709,METASTASIO.,"coincidence of narrow circumstances, a defective education, and poverty of"
2710,METASTASIO.,"intellect. Is it then surprising, that in the hands of such a triumvirate"
2711,METASTASIO.,"the art should be degraded to an imposture, to the trick of a juggler? but"
2712,METASTASIO.,"it surely would be a cause of wonder, if, with such leprous members, the"
2713,METASTASIO.,sound and respectable body of its professors should escape the suspicion
2714,METASTASIO.,of partaking their contamination.
