67,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,
68,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"THIS is the ship of pearl, which, poets feign,"
69,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Sails the unshadowed main,--"
70,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,The venturous bark that flings
71,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings
72,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"In gulfs enchanted, where the Siren sings,"
73,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"And coral reefs lie bare,"
74,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.
75,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,
76,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
77,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Wrecked is the ship of pearl!
78,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"And every chambered cell,"
79,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,"
80,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,"
81,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Before thee lies revealed,--"
82,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed!"
83,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,
84,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Year after year beheld the silent toil
85,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,That spread his lustrous coil;
86,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Still, as the spiral grew,"
87,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"He left the past year's dwelling for the new,"
88,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Stole with soft step its shining archway through,"
89,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Built up its idle door,"
90,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more."
91,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,
92,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,"
93,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Child of the wandering sea,"
94,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Cast from her lap, forlorn!"
95,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
96,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Than ever Triton blew from wreathed horn
97,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"While on mine ear it rings,"
98,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings:--
99,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,
100,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,"
101,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,As the swift seasons roll!
102,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Leave thy low-vaulted past!
103,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Let each new temple, nobler than the last,"
104,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,"
105,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,"Till thou at length art free,"
106,THE CHAMBERED NAUTILUS,Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!

112,SUN AND SHADOW,SUN AND SHADOW
113,SUN AND SHADOW,
114,SUN AND SHADOW,"As I look from the isle, o'er its billows of green,"
115,SUN AND SHADOW,"To the billows of foam-crested blue,"
116,SUN AND SHADOW,"Yon bark, that afar in the distance is seen,"
117,SUN AND SHADOW,"Half dreaming, my eyes will pursue"
118,SUN AND SHADOW,"Now dark in the shadow, she scatters the spray"
119,SUN AND SHADOW,As the chaff in the stroke of the flail;
120,SUN AND SHADOW,"Now white as the sea-gull, she flies on her way,"
121,SUN AND SHADOW,The sun gleaming bright on her sail.
122,SUN AND SHADOW,
123,SUN AND SHADOW,"Yet her pilot is thinking of dangers to shun,--"
124,SUN AND SHADOW,Of breakers that whiten and roar;
125,SUN AND SHADOW,"How little he cares, if in shadow or sun"
126,SUN AND SHADOW,They see him who gaze from the shore!
127,SUN AND SHADOW,"He looks to the beacon that looms from the reef,"
128,SUN AND SHADOW,"To the rock that is under his lee,"
129,SUN AND SHADOW,"As he drifts on the blast, like a wind-wafted leaf,"
130,SUN AND SHADOW,O'er the gulfs of the desolate sea.
131,SUN AND SHADOW,
132,SUN AND SHADOW,Thus drifting afar to the dim-vaulted caves
133,SUN AND SHADOW,"Where life and its ventures are laid,"
134,SUN AND SHADOW,The dreamers who gaze while we battle the waves
135,SUN AND SHADOW,May see us in sunshine or shade;
136,SUN AND SHADOW,"Yet true to our course, though the shadows grow dark,"
137,SUN AND SHADOW,"We'll trim our broad sail as before,"
138,SUN AND SHADOW,"And stand by the rudder that governs the bark,"
139,SUN AND SHADOW,Nor ask how we look from the shore!

146,MUSA,
147,MUSA,O MY lost beauty!--hast thou folded quite
148,MUSA,Thy wings of morning light
149,MUSA,Beyond those iron gates
150,MUSA,"Where Life crowds hurrying to the haggard Fates,"
151,MUSA,And Age upon his mound of ashes waits
152,MUSA,"To chill our fiery dreams,"
153,MUSA,Hot from the heart of youth plunged in his icy streams?
154,MUSA,
155,MUSA,"Leave me not fading in these weeds of care,"
156,MUSA,Whose flowers are silvered hair!
157,MUSA,"Have I not loved thee long,"
158,MUSA,"Though my young lips have often done thee wrong,"
159,MUSA,And vexed thy heaven-tuned ear with careless song?
160,MUSA,"Ah, wilt thou yet return,"
161,MUSA,"Bearing thy rose-hued torch, and bid thine altar burn?"
162,MUSA,
163,MUSA,Come to me!--I will flood thy silent shrine
164,MUSA,"With my soul's sacred wine,"
165,MUSA,And heap thy marble floors
166,MUSA,"As the wild spice-trees waste their fragrant stores,"
167,MUSA,In leafy islands walled with madrepores
168,MUSA,"And lapped in Orient seas,"
169,MUSA,"When all their feathery palms toss, plume-like, in the breeze."
170,MUSA,
171,MUSA,"Come to me!--thou shalt feed on honeyed words,"
172,MUSA,Sweeter than song of birds;--
173,MUSA,"No wailing bulbul's throat,"
174,MUSA,No melting dulcimer's melodious note
175,MUSA,"When o'er the midnight wave its murmurs float,"
176,MUSA,Thy ravished sense might soothe
177,MUSA,"With flow so liquid-soft, with strain so velvet-smooth."
178,MUSA,
179,MUSA,"Thou shalt be decked with jewels, like a queen,"
180,MUSA,Sought in those bowers of green
181,MUSA,Where loop the clustered vines
182,MUSA,"And the close-clinging dulcamara twines,--"
183,MUSA,"Pure pearls of Maydew where the moonlight shines,"
184,MUSA,"And Summer's fruited gems,"
185,MUSA,And coral pendants shorn from Autumn's berried stems.
186,MUSA,
187,MUSA,"Sit by me drifting on the sleepy waves,--"
188,MUSA,"Or stretched by grass-grown graves,"
189,MUSA,"Whose gray, high-shouldered stones,"
190,MUSA,"Carved with old names Life's time-worn roll disowns,"
191,MUSA,"Lean, lichen-spotted, o'er the crumbled bones"
192,MUSA,Still slumbering where they lay
193,MUSA,While the sad Pilgrim watched to scare the wolf away.
194,MUSA,
195,MUSA,Spread o'er my couch thy visionary wing!
196,MUSA,"Still let me dream and sing,--"
197,MUSA,Dream of that winding shore
198,MUSA,"Where scarlet cardinals bloom-for me no more,--"
199,MUSA,"The stream with heaven beneath its liquid floor,"
200,MUSA,And clustering nenuphars
201,MUSA,Sprinkling its mirrored blue like golden-chaliced stars!
202,MUSA,
203,MUSA,Come while their balms the linden-blossoms shed!--
204,MUSA,"Come while the rose is red,--"
205,MUSA,While blue-eyed Summer smiles
206,MUSA,On the green ripples round yon sunken piles
207,MUSA,"Washed by the moon-wave warm from Indian isles,"
208,MUSA,And on the sultry air
209,MUSA,The chestnuts spread their palms like holy men in prayer!
210,MUSA,
211,MUSA,Oh for thy burning lips to fire my brain
212,MUSA,"With thrills of wild, sweet pain!--"
213,MUSA,"On life's autumnal blast,"
214,MUSA,"Like shrivelled leaves, youth's passion-flowers are cast,--"
215,MUSA,"Once loving thee, we love thee to the last!--"
216,MUSA,"Behold thy new-decked shrine,"
217,MUSA,"And hear once more the voice that breathed ""Forever thine!"""

226,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
227,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"YES, we knew we must lose him,--though friendship may claim"
228,TO J. L. MOTLEY,To blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame;
229,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"Though fondly, at parting, we call him our own,"
230,TO J. L. MOTLEY,'T is the whisper of love when the bugle has blown.
231,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
232,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"As the rider that rests with the spur on his heel,"
233,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"As the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel,"
234,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"As the archer that stands with his shaft on the string,"
235,TO J. L. MOTLEY,He stoops from his toil to the garland we bring.
236,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
237,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"What pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom,"
238,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"Till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom,"
239,TO J. L. MOTLEY,While the tapestry lengthens the life-glowing dyes
240,TO J. L. MOTLEY,That caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies!
241,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
242,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"In the alcoves of death, in the charnels of timid,"
243,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"Where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime,"
244,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"There are triumphs untold, there are martyrs unsung,"
245,TO J. L. MOTLEY,There are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue!
246,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
247,TO J. L. MOTLEY,Let us hear the proud story which time has bequeathed!
248,TO J. L. MOTLEY,From lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed!
249,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"Let him summon its tyrants, and tell us their doom,"
250,TO J. L. MOTLEY,Though he sweep the black past like Van Tromp with his broom!

253,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
254,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"The dream flashes by, for the west-winds awake"
255,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"On pampas, on prairie, o'er mountain and lake,"
256,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"To bathe the swift bark, like a sea-girdled shrine,"
257,TO J. L. MOTLEY,With incense they stole from the rose and the pine.
258,TO J. L. MOTLEY,
259,TO J. L. MOTLEY,So fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed
260,TO J. L. MOTLEY,When the dead summer's jewels were trampled and crushed:
261,TO J. L. MOTLEY,"THE TRUE KNIGHT OF LEARNING,--the world holds him dear,--"

281,WHAT WE ALL THINK,
282,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"That--mother, sister, wife, or child--"
283,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"The ""best of women"" each has known."
284,WHAT WE ALL THINK,Were school-boys ever half so wild?
285,WHAT WE ALL THINK,How young the grandpapas have grown!

292,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"Whene'er we groan with ache or pain,--"
293,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"Some common ailment of the race,--"
294,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"Though doctors think the matter plain,--"
295,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"That ours is ""a peculiar case."""
296,WHAT WE ALL THINK,
297,WHAT WE ALL THINK,That when like babes with fingers burned
298,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"We count one bitter maxim more,"
299,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"Our lesson all the world has learned,"
300,WHAT WE ALL THINK,And men are wiser than before.
301,WHAT WE ALL THINK,
302,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"That when we sob o'er fancied woes,"
303,WHAT WE ALL THINK,The angels hovering overhead
304,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"Count every pitying drop that flows,"
305,WHAT WE ALL THINK,And love us for the tears we shed.
306,WHAT WE ALL THINK,
307,WHAT WE ALL THINK,That when we stand with tearless eye
308,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"And turn the beggar from our door,"
309,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"They still approve us when we sigh,"
310,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"""Ah, had I but one thousand more!"""
311,WHAT WE ALL THINK,
312,WHAT WE ALL THINK,Though temples crowd the crumbled brink
313,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"O'erhanging truth's eternal flow,"
314,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"Their tablets bold with what we think,"
315,WHAT WE ALL THINK,Their echoes dumb to what we know;
316,WHAT WE ALL THINK,
317,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"That one unquestioned text we read,"
318,WHAT WE ALL THINK,"All doubt beyond, all fear above,"

330,INTRA MUROS,"THE sunbeams, lost for half a year,"
331,INTRA MUROS,Slant through my pane their morning rays;
332,INTRA MUROS,"For dry northwesters cold and clear,"
333,INTRA MUROS,The east blows in its thin blue haze.
334,INTRA MUROS,
335,INTRA MUROS,"And first the snowdrop's bells are seen,"
336,INTRA MUROS,Then close against the sheltering wall
337,INTRA MUROS,"The tulip's horn of dusky green,"
338,INTRA MUROS,The peony's dark unfolding ball.
339,INTRA MUROS,
340,INTRA MUROS,The golden-chaliced crocus burns;
341,INTRA MUROS,The long narcissus-blades appear;
342,INTRA MUROS,The cone-beaked hyacinth returns
343,INTRA MUROS,To light her blue-flamed chandelier.
344,INTRA MUROS,
345,INTRA MUROS,"The willow's whistling lashes, wrung"
346,INTRA MUROS,"By the wild winds of gusty March,"
347,INTRA MUROS,"With sallow leaflets lightly strung,"
348,INTRA MUROS,Are swaying by the tufted larch.
349,INTRA MUROS,
350,INTRA MUROS,The elms have robed their slender spray
351,INTRA MUROS,With full-blown flower and embryo leaf;
352,INTRA MUROS,Wide o'er the clasping arch of day
353,INTRA MUROS,Soars like a cloud their hoary chief.
354,INTRA MUROS,
355,INTRA MUROS,"See the proud tulip's flaunting cup,"
356,INTRA MUROS,"That flames in glory for an hour,--"
357,INTRA MUROS,"Behold it withering,--then look up,--"
358,INTRA MUROS,How meek the forest monarch's flower!

368,INTRA MUROS,Pink as Aurora's finger-tips.
369,INTRA MUROS,
370,INTRA MUROS,Nor less the flood of light that showers
371,INTRA MUROS,"On beauty's changed corolla-shades,--"
372,INTRA MUROS,The walks are gay as bridal bowers
373,INTRA MUROS,With rows of many-petalled maids.
374,INTRA MUROS,
375,INTRA MUROS,The scarlet shell-fish click and clash
376,INTRA MUROS,In the blue barrow where they slide;
377,INTRA MUROS,"The horseman, proud of streak and splash,"
378,INTRA MUROS,Creeps homeward from his morning ride.
379,INTRA MUROS,
380,INTRA MUROS,"Here comes the dealer's awkward string,"
381,INTRA MUROS,"With neck in rope and tail in knot,--"
382,INTRA MUROS,"Rough colts, with careless country-swing,"
383,INTRA MUROS,In lazy walk or slouching trot.

390,INTRA MUROS,To seek with thee thy western hills!
391,INTRA MUROS,
392,INTRA MUROS,"I hear the whispering voice of Spring,"
393,INTRA MUROS,"The thrush's trill, the robin's cry,"
394,INTRA MUROS,Like some poor bird with prisoned wing
395,INTRA MUROS,"That sits and sings, but longs to fly."
396,INTRA MUROS,
397,INTRA MUROS,"Oh for one spot of living greed,--"
398,INTRA MUROS,"One little spot where leaves can grow,--"
399,INTRA MUROS,"To love unblamed, to walk unseen,"

409,PROLOGUE,"A PROLOGUE? Well, of course the ladies know,--"
410,PROLOGUE,"I have my doubts. No matter,--here we go!"
411,PROLOGUE,What is a Prologue? Let our Tutor teach:
412,PROLOGUE,Pro means beforehand; logos stands for speech.
413,PROLOGUE,"'T is like the harper's prelude on the strings,"
414,PROLOGUE,The prima donna's courtesy ere she sings;
415,PROLOGUE,Prologues in metre are to other pros
416,PROLOGUE,As worsted stockings are to engine-hose.
417,PROLOGUE,"""The world's a stage,""--as Shakespeare said, one day;"
418,PROLOGUE,The stage a world--was what he meant to say.
419,PROLOGUE,"The outside world's a blunder, that is clear;"
420,PROLOGUE,The real world that Nature meant is here.
421,PROLOGUE,Here every foundling finds its lost mamma;
422,PROLOGUE,"Each rogue, repentant, melts his stern papa;"
423,PROLOGUE,"Misers relent, the spendthrift's debts are paid,"
424,PROLOGUE,The cheats are taken in the traps they laid;
425,PROLOGUE,One after one the troubles all are past
426,PROLOGUE,"Till the fifth act comes right side up at last,"
427,PROLOGUE,"When the young couple, old folks, rogues, and all,"
428,PROLOGUE,"Join hands, so happy at the curtain's fall."
429,PROLOGUE,"Here suffering virtue ever finds relief,"
430,PROLOGUE,And black-browed ruffians always come to grief.

854,A LOGICAL STORY,That was built in such a logical way
855,A LOGICAL STORY,"It ran a hundred years to a day,"
856,A LOGICAL STORY,"And then, of a sudden, it--ah, but stay,"
857,A LOGICAL STORY,"I 'll tell you what happened without delay,"
858,A LOGICAL STORY,"Scaring the parson into fits,"
859,A LOGICAL STORY,"Frightening people out of their wits,--"
860,A LOGICAL STORY,"Have you ever heard of that, I say?"
861,A LOGICAL STORY,
862,A LOGICAL STORY,Seventeen hundred and fifty-five.
863,A LOGICAL STORY,"_Georgius Secundus_ was then alive,--"
864,A LOGICAL STORY,Snuffy old drone from the German hive.
865,A LOGICAL STORY,That was the year when Lisbon-town
866,A LOGICAL STORY,"Saw the earth open and gulp her down,"
867,A LOGICAL STORY,"And Braddock's army was done so brown,"
868,A LOGICAL STORY,Left without a scalp to its crown.
869,A LOGICAL STORY,It was on the terrible Earthquake-day
870,A LOGICAL STORY,That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.
871,A LOGICAL STORY,
872,A LOGICAL STORY,
873,A LOGICAL STORY,"Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,"
874,A LOGICAL STORY,"There is always _somewhere_ a weakest spot,--"
875,A LOGICAL STORY,"In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,"
876,A LOGICAL STORY,"In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,"
877,A LOGICAL STORY,"In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,--lurking still,"
878,A LOGICAL STORY,"Find it somewhere you must and will,--"
879,A LOGICAL STORY,"Above or below, or within or without,--"
880,A LOGICAL STORY,"And that 's the reason, beyond a doubt,"
881,A LOGICAL STORY,"That a chaise breaks down, but does n't wear out."
882,A LOGICAL STORY,
883,A LOGICAL STORY,"But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,"
884,A LOGICAL STORY,"With an ""I dew vum,"" or an ""I tell yeou "")"
885,A LOGICAL STORY,He would build one shay to beat the taown
886,A LOGICAL STORY,'n' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';
887,A LOGICAL STORY,It should be so built that it couldn' break daown
888,A LOGICAL STORY,"""Fur,"" said the Deacon, ""'t 's mighty plain"
889,A LOGICAL STORY,Thut the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain;
890,A LOGICAL STORY,"'n' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,"
891,A LOGICAL STORY,Is only jest
892,A LOGICAL STORY,"T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."""
893,A LOGICAL STORY,
894,A LOGICAL STORY,So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
895,A LOGICAL STORY,"Where he could find the strongest oak,"
896,A LOGICAL STORY,"That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,--"
897,A LOGICAL STORY,That was for spokes and floor and sills;
898,A LOGICAL STORY,He sent for lancewood to make the thills;
899,A LOGICAL STORY,"The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees,"
900,A LOGICAL STORY,"The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,"
901,A LOGICAL STORY,But lasts like iron for things like these;
902,A LOGICAL STORY,"The hubs of logs from the ""Settler's ellum,""--"
903,A LOGICAL STORY,"Last of its timber,--they could n't sell 'em,"
904,A LOGICAL STORY,"Never an axe had seen their chips,"
905,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the wedges flew from between their lips,"
906,A LOGICAL STORY,Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;
907,A LOGICAL STORY,"Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,"
908,A LOGICAL STORY,"Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,"
909,A LOGICAL STORY,"Steel of the finest, bright and blue;"
910,A LOGICAL STORY,"Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;"
911,A LOGICAL STORY,"Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide"
912,A LOGICAL STORY,Found in the pit when the tanner died.
913,A LOGICAL STORY,"That was the way he ""put her through."""
914,A LOGICAL STORY,"""There!"" said the Deacon, ""naow she 'll dew!"""
915,A LOGICAL STORY,
916,A LOGICAL STORY,"Do! I tell you, I rather guess"
917,A LOGICAL STORY,"She was a wonder, and nothing less!"
918,A LOGICAL STORY,"Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,"
919,A LOGICAL STORY,"Deacon and deaconess dropped away,"
920,A LOGICAL STORY,Children and grandchildren--where were they?
921,A LOGICAL STORY,But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay
922,A LOGICAL STORY,As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day!
923,A LOGICAL STORY,
924,A LOGICAL STORY,EIGHTEEN HUNDRED;--it came and found
925,A LOGICAL STORY,The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.
926,A LOGICAL STORY,Eighteen hundred increased by ten;--
927,A LOGICAL STORY,"""Hahnsum kerridge"" they called it then."
928,A LOGICAL STORY,Eighteen hundred and twenty came;--
929,A LOGICAL STORY,Running as usual; much the same.
930,A LOGICAL STORY,"Thirty and forty at last arrive,"
931,A LOGICAL STORY,"And then come fifty, and FIFTY-FIVE."
932,A LOGICAL STORY,"First of November, 'Fifty-five!"
933,A LOGICAL STORY,This morning the parson takes a drive.
934,A LOGICAL STORY,"Now, small boys, get out of the way!"
935,A LOGICAL STORY,"Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,"
936,A LOGICAL STORY,
937,A LOGICAL STORY,Little of all we value here
938,A LOGICAL STORY,Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year
939,A LOGICAL STORY,Without both feeling and looking queer.
940,A LOGICAL STORY,"In fact, there 's nothing that keeps its youth,"
941,A LOGICAL STORY,"So far as I know, but a tree and truth."
942,A LOGICAL STORY,(This is a moral that runs at large;
943,A LOGICAL STORY,Take it.--You 're welcome.--No extra charge.)
944,A LOGICAL STORY,
945,A LOGICAL STORY,"FIRST OF NOVEMBER,--the Earthquake-day,--"
946,A LOGICAL STORY,"There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,"
947,A LOGICAL STORY,"A general flavor of mild decay,"
948,A LOGICAL STORY,"But nothing local, as one may say."
949,A LOGICAL STORY,"There couldn't be,--for the Deacon's art"
950,A LOGICAL STORY,Had made it so like in every part
951,A LOGICAL STORY,That there was n't a chance for one to start.
952,A LOGICAL STORY,"For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,"
953,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the floor was just as strong as the sills,"
954,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the panels just as strong as the floor,"
955,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the whipple-tree neither less nor more,"
956,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the back-crossbar as strong as the fore,"
957,A LOGICAL STORY,And spring and axle and hub encore.
958,A LOGICAL STORY,"And yet, as a whole, it is past a doubt"
959,A LOGICAL STORY,In another hour it will be worn out!
960,A LOGICAL STORY,
961,A LOGICAL STORY,"Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay."
962,A LOGICAL STORY,"""Huddup!"" said the parson.--Off went they."
963,A LOGICAL STORY,"The parson was working his Sunday's text,--"
964,A LOGICAL STORY,"Had got to fifthly, and stopped perplexed"
965,A LOGICAL STORY,At what the--Moses--was coming next.
966,A LOGICAL STORY,"All at once the horse stood still,"
967,A LOGICAL STORY,Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.
968,A LOGICAL STORY,"First a shiver, and then a thrill,"
969,A LOGICAL STORY,"Then something decidedly like a spill,--"
970,A LOGICAL STORY,"And the parson was sitting upon a rock,"
971,A LOGICAL STORY,"At half past nine by the meet'n'-house clock,--"
972,A LOGICAL STORY,Just the hour of the Earthquake shock!
973,A LOGICAL STORY,"What do you think the parson found,"
974,A LOGICAL STORY,When he got up and stared around?
975,A LOGICAL STORY,"The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,"
976,A LOGICAL STORY,As if it had been to the mill and ground!
977,A LOGICAL STORY,"You see, of course, if you 're not a dunce,"
978,A LOGICAL STORY,"How it went to pieces all at once,--"
979,A LOGICAL STORY,"All at once, and nothing first,--"
980,A LOGICAL STORY,Just as bubbles do when they burst.
981,A LOGICAL STORY,
982,A LOGICAL STORY,End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.

1041,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
1042,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,But this is neither here nor there;
1043,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,I'm talking about an old arm-chair.
1044,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"You 've heard, no doubt, of PARSON TURELL?"
1045,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Over at Medford he used to dwell;
1046,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Married one of the Mathers' folk;
1047,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Got with his wife a chair of oak,--"
1048,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Funny old chair with seat like wedge,"
1049,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Sharp behind and broad front edge,--"
1050,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"One of the oddest of human things,"
1051,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Turned all over with knobs and rings,--"
1052,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"But heavy, and wide, and deep, and grand,--"
1053,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Fit for the worthies of the land,--"
1054,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Chief Justice Sewall a cause to try in,"
1055,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Or Cotton Mather to sit--and lie--in.
1056,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Parson Turell bequeathed the same
1057,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"To a certain student,--SMITH by name;"
1058,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"These were the terms, as we are told:"
1059,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""Saide Smith saide Chaire to have and holde;"
1060,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When he doth graduate, then to passe"
1061,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,To ye oldest Youth in ye Senior Classe.
1062,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"On payment of ""--(naming a certain sum)--"
1063,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""By him to whom ye Chaire shall come;"
1064,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"He to ye oldest Senior next,"
1065,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And soe forever,""--(thus runs the text,)--"
1066,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""But one Crown lesse then he gave to claime,"
1067,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"That being his Debte for use of same."""
1068,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Smith transferred it to one of the BROWNS,"
1069,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And took his money,--five silver crowns."
1070,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Brown delivered it up to MOORE,"
1071,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Who paid, it is plain, not five, but four."
1072,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Moore made over the chair to LEE,"
1073,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Who gave him crowns of silver three.
1074,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Lee conveyed it unto DREW,"
1075,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And now the payment, of course, was two."
1076,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Drew gave up the chair to DUNN,--"
1077,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"All he got, as you see, was one."
1078,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Dunn released the chair to HALL,"
1079,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And got by the bargain no crown at all.
1080,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And now it passed to a second BROWN,"
1081,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Who took it and likewise claimed a crown.
1082,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When Brown conveyed it unto WARE,"
1083,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Having had one crown, to make it fair,"
1084,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,He paid him two crowns to take the chair;
1085,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And Ware, being honest, (as all Wares be,)"
1086,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"He paid one POTTER, who took it, three."
1087,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Four got ROBINSON; five got Dix;
1088,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,JOHNSON primus demanded six;
1089,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And so the sum kept gathering still
1090,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Till after the battle of Bunker's Hill.
1091,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
1092,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"When paper money became so cheap,"
1093,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Folks would n't count it, but said ""a heap,"""
1094,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"A certain RICHARDS,--the books declare,--"
1095,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,(A. M. in '90? I've looked with care
1096,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Through the Triennial,--name not there,)--"
1097,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"This person, Richards, was offered then"
1098,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Eightscore pounds, but would have ten;"
1099,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Nine, I think, was the sum he took,--"
1100,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Not quite certain,--but see the book."
1101,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"By and by the wars were still,"
1102,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,But nothing had altered the Parson's will.
1103,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The old arm-chair was solid yet,"
1104,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,But saddled with such a monstrous debt!
1105,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Things grew quite too bad to bear,"
1106,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Paying such sums to get rid of the chair
1107,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"But dead men's fingers hold awful tight,"
1108,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And there was the will in black and white,"
1109,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Plain enough for a child to spell.
1110,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"What should be done no man could tell,"
1111,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"For the chair was a kind of nightmare curse,"
1112,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And every season but made it worse.
1113,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
1114,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"As a last resort, to clear the doubt,"
1115,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,They got old GOVERNOR HANCOCK out.
1116,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The Governor came with his Lighthorse Troop
1117,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And his mounted truckmen, all cock-a-hoop;"
1118,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Halberds glittered and colors flew,"
1119,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"French horns whinnied and trumpets blew,"
1120,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The yellow fifes whistled between their teeth,"
1121,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And the bumble-bee bass-drums boomed beneath;
1122,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"So he rode with all his band,"
1123,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Till the President met him, cap in hand."
1124,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The Governor ""hefted"" the crowns, and said,--"
1125,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""A will is a will, and the Parson's dead."""
1126,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The Governor hefted the crowns. Said he,--"
1127,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""There is your p'int. And here 's my fee."
1128,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
1129,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""These are the terms you must fulfil,--"
1130,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"On such conditions I BREAK THE WILL!"""
1131,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The Governor mentioned what these should be.
1132,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,(Just wait a minute and then you 'll see.)
1133,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The President prayed. Then all was still,"
1134,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And the Governor rose and BROKE THE WILL!
1135,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"""About those conditions?"" Well, now you go"
1136,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And do as I tell you, and then you'll know."
1137,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Once a year, on Commencement day,"
1138,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"If you 'll only take the pains to stay,"
1139,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"You'll see the President in the CHAIR,"
1140,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Likewise the Governor sitting there.
1141,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The President rises; both old and young
1142,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"May hear his speech in a foreign tongue,"
1143,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"The meaning whereof, as lawyers swear,"
1144,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Is this: Can I keep this old arm-chair?
1145,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And then his Excellency bows,"
1146,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,As much as to say that he allows.
1147,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,The Vice-Gub. next is called by name;
1148,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"He bows like t' other, which means the same."
1149,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"And all the officers round 'em bow,"
1150,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,As much as to say that they allow.
1151,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And a lot of parchments about the chair
1152,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"Are handed to witnesses then and there,"
1153,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,And then the lawyers hold it clear
1154,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,That the chair is safe for another year.
1155,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,
1156,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"God bless you, Gentlemen! Learn to give"
1157,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Money to colleges while you live.
1158,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,Don't be silly and think you'll try
1159,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"To bother the colleges, when you die,"
1160,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,"With codicil this, and codicil that,"
1161,A MATHEMATICAL STORY,That Knowledge may starve while Law grows fat;

2022,REGRETS,"The climbing of the upward-sailing cloud,"
2023,REGRETS,"The sinking of the downward-falling star,--"
2024,REGRETS,All these are pictures of the changing moods
2025,REGRETS,Borne through the midnight stillness of my soul.
2026,REGRETS,
2027,REGRETS,"Here am I, bound upon this pillared rock,"
2028,REGRETS,Prey to the vulture of a vast desire
2029,REGRETS,That feeds upon my life. I burst my bands
2030,REGRETS,"And steal a moment's freedom from the beak,"
2031,REGRETS,The clinging talons and the shadowing plumes;
2032,REGRETS,"Then comes the false enchantress, with her song;"
2033,REGRETS,
2034,REGRETS,"""Thou wouldst not lay thy forehead in the dust"
2035,REGRETS,Like the base herd that feeds and breeds and dies
2036,REGRETS,"Lo, the fair garlands that I weave for thee,"
2037,REGRETS,"Unchanging as the belt Orion wears,"
2038,REGRETS,"Bright as the jewels of the seven-starred Crown,"
2039,REGRETS,"The spangled stream of Berenice's hair!"""
2040,REGRETS,And so she twines the fetters with the flowers
2041,REGRETS,"Around my yielding limbs, and the fierce bird"
2042,REGRETS,"Stoops to his quarry,--then to feed his rage"
2043,REGRETS,Of ravening hunger I must drain my blood
2044,REGRETS,"And let the dew-drenched, poison-breeding night"
2045,REGRETS,"Steal all the freshness from my fading cheek,"
2046,REGRETS,And leave its shadows round my caverned eyes.
2047,REGRETS,All for a line in some unheeded scroll;
2048,REGRETS,"All for a stone that tells to gaping clowns,"
2049,REGRETS,"""Here lies a restless wretch beneath a clod"
2050,REGRETS,Where squats the jealous nightmare men call
2051,REGRETS,"Fame!"""
2052,REGRETS,
2053,REGRETS,I marvel not at him who scorns his kind
2054,REGRETS,And thinks not sadly of the time foretold
2055,REGRETS,"When the old hulk we tread shall be a wreck,"
2056,REGRETS,"A slag, a cinder drifting through the sky"
2057,REGRETS,"Without its crew of fools! We live too long,"
2058,REGRETS,"And even so are not content to die,"
2059,REGRETS,But load the mould that covers up our bones
2060,REGRETS,With stones that stand like beggars by the road
2061,REGRETS,And show death's grievous wound and ask for tears;
2062,REGRETS,"Write our great books to teach men who we are,"
2063,REGRETS,Sing our fine songs that tell in artful phrase
2064,REGRETS,"The secrets of our lives, and plead and pray"
2065,REGRETS,"For alms of memory with the after time,"
2066,REGRETS,Those few swift seasons while the earth shall wear
2067,REGRETS,"Its leafy summers, ere its core grows cold"
2068,REGRETS,And the moist life of all that breathes shall die;
2069,REGRETS,"Or as the new-born seer, perchance more wise,"
2070,REGRETS,"Would have us deem, before its growing mass,"
2071,REGRETS,"Pelted with star-dust, stoned with meteor-balls,"
2072,REGRETS,"Heats like a hammered anvil, till at last"
2073,REGRETS,Man and his works and all that stirred itself
2074,REGRETS,"Of its own motion, in the fiery glow"
2075,REGRETS,"Turns to a flaming vapor, and our orb"
2076,REGRETS,Shines a new sun for earths that shall be born.
2077,REGRETS,
2078,REGRETS,"I am as old as Egypt to myself,"
2079,REGRETS,Brother to them that squared the pyramids
2080,REGRETS,By the same stars I watch. I read the page
2081,REGRETS,"Where every letter is a glittering world,"
2082,REGRETS,"With them who looked from Shinar's clay-built towers,"
2083,REGRETS,Ere yet the wanderer of the Midland sea
2084,REGRETS,Had missed the fallen sister of the seven.
2085,REGRETS,"I dwell in spaces vague, remote, unknown,"
2086,REGRETS,"Save to the silent few, who, leaving earth,"
2087,REGRETS,Quit all communion with their living time.
2088,REGRETS,"I lose myself in that ethereal void,"
2089,REGRETS,Till I have tired my wings and long to fill
2090,REGRETS,"My breast with denser air, to stand, to walk"
2091,REGRETS,With eyes not raised above my fellow-men.
2092,REGRETS,"Sick of my unwalled, solitary realm,"
2093,REGRETS,I ask to change the myriad lifeless worlds
2094,REGRETS,I visit as mine own for one poor patch
2095,REGRETS,Of this dull spheroid and a little breath
2096,REGRETS,To shape in word or deed to serve my kind.
2097,REGRETS,"Was ever giant's dungeon dug so deep,"
2098,REGRETS,"Was ever tyrant's fetter forged so strong,"
2099,REGRETS,Was e'er such deadly poison in the draught
2100,REGRETS,"The false wife mingles for the trusting fool,"

2112,SYMPATHIES,Rolls in the crimson summer of its year;
2113,SYMPATHIES,But what to me the summer or the snow
2114,SYMPATHIES,"Of worlds that throb with life in forms unknown,"
2115,SYMPATHIES,If life indeed be theirs; I heed not these.
2116,SYMPATHIES,My heart is simply human; all my care
2117,SYMPATHIES,For them whose dust is fashioned like mine own;
2118,SYMPATHIES,"These ache with cold and hunger, live in pain,"
2119,SYMPATHIES,And shake with fear of worlds more full of woe;
2120,SYMPATHIES,"There may be others worthier of my love,"

2122,SYMPATHIES,
2123,SYMPATHIES,"There are two veils of language, hid beneath"
2124,SYMPATHIES,"Whose sheltering folds, we dare to be ourselves;"
2125,SYMPATHIES,And not that other self which nods and smiles
2126,SYMPATHIES,"And babbles in our name; the one is Prayer,"
2127,SYMPATHIES,Lending its licensed freedom to the tongue
2128,SYMPATHIES,That tells our sorrows and our sins to Heaven;
2129,SYMPATHIES,"The other, Verse, that throws its spangled web"
2130,SYMPATHIES,Around our naked speech and makes it bold.
2131,SYMPATHIES,"I, whose best prayer is silence; sitting dumb"

2141,SYMPATHIES,"Between me and the fairest of the stars,"
2142,SYMPATHIES,I tell my lonely thoughts as unto thee.
2143,SYMPATHIES,Look not for marvels of the scholar's pen
2144,SYMPATHIES,In my rude measure; I can only show
2145,SYMPATHIES,"A slender-margined, unillumined page,"
2146,SYMPATHIES,And trust its meaning to the flattering eye
2147,SYMPATHIES,That reads it in the gracious light of love.
2148,SYMPATHIES,"Ah, wouldst thou clothe thyself in breathing shape"
2149,SYMPATHIES,"And nestle at my side, my voice should lend"
2150,SYMPATHIES,Whate'er my verse may lack of tender rhythm
2151,SYMPATHIES,To make thee listen.
2152,SYMPATHIES,
2153,SYMPATHIES,I have stood entranced
2154,SYMPATHIES,"When, with her fingers wandering o'er the keys,"
2155,SYMPATHIES,The white enchantress with the golden hair
2156,SYMPATHIES,Breathed all her soul through some unvalued rhyme;
2157,SYMPATHIES,Some flower of song that long had lost its bloom;
2158,SYMPATHIES,Lo! its dead summer kindled as she sang!
2159,SYMPATHIES,"The sweet contralto, like the ringdove's coo,"
2160,SYMPATHIES,"Thrilled it with brooding, fond, caressing tones,"
2161,SYMPATHIES,"And the pale minstrel's passion lived again,"
2162,SYMPATHIES,Tearful and trembling as a dewy rose
2163,SYMPATHIES,The wind has shaken till it fills the air
2164,SYMPATHIES,With light and fragrance. Such the wondrous charm
2165,SYMPATHIES,A song can borrow when the bosom throbs
2166,SYMPATHIES,That lends it breath.
2167,SYMPATHIES,
2168,SYMPATHIES,So from the poet's lips
2169,SYMPATHIES,"His verse sounds doubly sweet, for none like him"
2170,SYMPATHIES,Feels every cadence of its wave-like flow;
2171,SYMPATHIES,"He lives the passion over, while he reads,"
2172,SYMPATHIES,"That shook him as he sang his lofty strain,"
2173,SYMPATHIES,"And pours his life through each resounding line,"
2174,SYMPATHIES,"As ocean, when the stormy winds are hushed,"
2175,SYMPATHIES,Still rolls and thunders through his billowy caves.

2185,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Sought me to be his scholar,-me, run wild"
2186,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"From books and teachers,-kindled in my soul"
2187,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"The love of knowledge; led me to his tower,"
2188,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,Showed me the wonders of the midnight realm
2189,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"His hollow sceptre ruled, or seemed to rule,"
2190,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Taught me the mighty secrets of the spheres,"

2214,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,
2215,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"He shrivelled as I spread my growing leaves,"

2218,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"But I for him, a shadow, a defence,"
2219,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"The guardian of his fame, his guide, his staff,"

2221,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"I was his eye, his ear, his cunning hand,"

2224,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"That sees its shortening span, its lengthening shades,"
2225,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"That clutches what it may with eager grasp,"
2226,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"And drops at last with empty, outstretched hands."
2227,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,All this he dreamed not. He would sit him down
2228,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Thinking to work his problems as of old,"
2229,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"And find the star he thought so plain a blur,"
2230,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,The columned figures labyrinthine wilds
2231,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,"Without my comment, blind and senseless scrawls"
2232,MASTER AND SCHOLAR,That vexed him with their riddles; he would strive

2507,RIGHTS,Ah! He who prayed the prayer of all mankind

2825,LOVE,"Had wrought its worst to torture, and had left"
2826,LOVE,"With rage unsated, white and stark and cold,"
2827,LOVE,Could hate have shaped a demon more malign
2828,LOVE,Than him the dead men mummied in their creed
2829,LOVE,And taught their trembling children to adore!
2830,LOVE,
2831,LOVE,Made in his image! Sweet and gracious souls
2832,LOVE,"Dear to my heart by nature's fondest names,"
2833,LOVE,Is not your memory still the precious mould
2834,LOVE,That lends its form to Him who hears my prayer?
2835,LOVE,"Thus only I behold Him, like to them,"
2836,LOVE,"Long-suffering, gentle, ever slow to wrath,"
2837,LOVE,"If wrath it be that only wounds to heal,"
2838,LOVE,Ready to meet the wanderer ere he reach
2839,LOVE,"The door he seeks, forgetful of his sin,"
2840,LOVE,"Longing to clasp him in a father's arms,"
2841,LOVE,And seal his pardon with a pitying tear!
2842,LOVE,
2843,LOVE,"Four gospels tell their story to mankind,"
2844,LOVE,"And none so full of soft, caressing words"
2845,LOVE,That bring the Maid of Bethlehem and her Babe
2846,LOVE,"Before our tear-dimmed eyes, as his who learned"
2847,LOVE,In the meek service of his gracious art
2848,LOVE,"The tones which, like the medicinal balms"
2849,LOVE,"That calm the sufferer's anguish, soothe our souls."
2850,LOVE,"Oh that the loving woman, she who sat"
2851,LOVE,"So long a listener at her Master's feet,"
2852,LOVE,"Had left us Mary's Gospel,--all she heard"
2853,LOVE,"Too sweet, too subtle for the ear of man!"
2854,LOVE,Mark how the tender-hearted mothers read
2855,LOVE,The messages of love between the lines
2856,LOVE,Of the same page that loads the bitter tongue
2857,LOVE,Of him who deals in terror as his trade
2858,LOVE,With threatening words of wrath that scorch like flame
2859,LOVE,They tell of angels whispering round the bed
2860,LOVE,"Of the sweet infant smiling in its dream,"
2861,LOVE,"Of lambs enfolded in the Shepherd's arms,"
2862,LOVE,Of Him who blessed the children; of the land
2863,LOVE,"Where crystal rivers feed unfading flowers,"
2864,LOVE,"Of cities golden-paved with streets of pearl,"
2865,LOVE,"Of the white robes the winged creatures wear,"
2866,LOVE,The crowns and harps from whose melodious strings
2867,LOVE,"One long, sweet anthem flows forevermore!"
2868,LOVE,"We too had human mothers, even as Thou,"
2869,LOVE,Whom we have learned to worship as remote
2870,LOVE,"From mortal kindred, wast a cradled babe."
2871,LOVE,"The milk of woman filled our branching veins,"
2872,LOVE,"She lulled us with her tender nursery-song,"
2873,LOVE,"And folded round us her untiring arms,"
2874,LOVE,While the first unremembered twilight yeas
2875,LOVE,Shaped us to conscious being; still we feel
2876,LOVE,"Her pulses in our own,--too faintly feel;"
2877,LOVE,Would that the heart of woman warmed our creeds!
2878,LOVE,
2879,LOVE,"Not from the sad-eyed hermit's lonely cell,"
2880,LOVE,Not from the conclave where the holy men
2881,LOVE,"Glare on each other, as with angry eyes"
2882,LOVE,"They battle for God's glory and their own,"
2883,LOVE,"Till, sick of wordy strife, a show of hands"
2884,LOVE,"Fixes the faith of ages yet unborn,--"
2885,LOVE,"Ah, not from these the listening soul can hear"
2886,LOVE,The Father's voice that speaks itself divine!
2887,LOVE,Love must be still our Master; till we learn
2888,LOVE,"What he can teach us of a woman's heart,"
2889,LOVE,We know not His whose love embraces all.
