76,PART I,
77,PART I,
78,PART I,"I sat and sewed, and sang some tender tune,"
79,PART I,"Oh, beauteous was that morn in early June!"
80,PART I,"Mellow with sunlight, and with blossoms fair:"
81,PART I,"The climbing rose-tree grew about me there,"
82,PART I,And checked with shade the sunny portico
83,PART I,"Where, morns like this, I came to read, or sew."
84,PART I,
85,PART I,"I heard the gate click, and a firm, quick tread"
86,PART I,Upon the walk.  No need to turn my head;
87,PART I,"I would mistake, and doubt my own voice sounding,"
88,PART I,Before his step upon the gravel bounding.
89,PART I,"In an unstudied attitude of grace,"
90,PART I,He stretched his comely form; and from his face
91,PART I,"He tossed the dark, damp curls; and at my knees,"
92,PART I,"With his broad hat he fanned the lazy breeze,"
93,PART I,"And turned his head, and lifted his large eyes,"
94,PART I,"Of that strange hue we see in ocean dyes,"
95,PART I,"And call it blue sometimes and sometimes green,"
96,PART I,"And save in poet eyes, not elsewhere seen."
97,PART I,"“Lest I should meet with my fair lady’s scorning,"
98,PART I,"For calling quite so early in the morning,"
99,PART I,"I’ve brought a passport that can never fail,”"
100,PART I,"He said, and, laughing, laid the morning mail"
101,PART I,Upon my lap.  “I’m welcome? so I thought!
102,PART I,I’ll figure by the letters that I brought
103,PART I,How glad you are to see me.  Only one?
104,PART I,And that one from a lady?  I’m undone!
105,PART I,"That, lightly skimmed, you’ll think me _such_ a bore,"
106,PART I,And wonder why I did not bring you four.
107,PART I,It’s ever thus: a woman cannot get
108,PART I,So many letters that she will not fret
109,PART I,O’er one that did not come.”
110,PART I,"“I’ll prove you wrong,”"
111,PART I,"I answered gaily, “here upon the spot!"
112,PART I,"This little letter, precious if not long,"
113,PART I,"Is just the one, of all you might have brought,"
114,PART I,"To please me.  You have heard me speak, I’m sure,"
115,PART I,Of Helen Trevor: she writes here to say
116,PART I,She’s coming out to see me; and will stay
117,PART I,"Till Autumn, maybe.  She is, like her note,"
118,PART I,"Petite and dainty, tender, loving, pure."
119,PART I,"You’d know her by a letter that she wrote,"
120,PART I,For a sweet tinted thing.  ’Tis always so:—
121,PART I,"Letters all blots, though finely written, show"
122,PART I,A slovenly person.  Letters stiff and white
123,PART I,"Bespeak a nature honest, plain, upright."
124,PART I,"And tissuey, tinted, perfumed notes, like this,"
125,PART I,Tell of a creature formed to pet and kiss.”
126,PART I,"My listener heard me with a slow, odd smile;"
127,PART I,"Stretched in abandon at my feet, the while,"
128,PART I,He fanned me idly with his broad-brimmed hat.
129,PART I,“Then all young ladies must be formed for that!”
130,PART I,"He laughed, and said."
131,PART I,"“Their letters read, and look,"
132,PART I,As like as twenty copies of one book.
133,PART I,"They’re written in a dainty, spider scrawl,"
134,PART I,"To ‘darling, precious Kate,’ or ‘Fan,’ or ‘Moll.’"
135,PART I,"The ‘dearest, sweetest’ friend they ever had."
136,PART I,"They say they ‘want to see you, oh, so bad!’"
137,PART I,"Vow they’ll ‘forget you, never, _never_, oh!’"
138,PART I,And then they tell about a splendid beau—
139,PART I,"A lovely hat—a charming dress, and send"
140,PART I,A little scrap of this to every friend.
141,PART I,"And then to close, for lack of something better,"
142,PART I,They beg you’ll ‘read and burn this horrid letter.’”
143,PART I,
144,PART I,"He watched me, smiling.  He was prone to vex"
145,PART I,And hector me with flings upon my sex.
146,PART I,"He liked, he said, to have me flash and frown,"
147,PART I,"So he could tease me, and then laugh me down."
148,PART I,My storms of wrath amused him very much:
149,PART I,He liked to see me go off at a touch;
150,PART I,"Anger became me—made my colour rise,"
151,PART I,And gave an added lustre to my eyes.
152,PART I,"So he would talk—and so he watched me now,"
153,PART I,To see the hot flush mantle cheek and brow.
154,PART I,"Instead, I answered coolly, with a smile,"
155,PART I,"Felling a seam with utmost care, meanwhile."
156,PART I,“The caustic tongue of Vivian Dangerfield
157,PART I,"Is barbed as ever, for my sex, this morn."
158,PART I,"Still unconvinced, no smallest point I yield."
159,PART I,"Woman I love, and trust, despite your scorn."
160,PART I,"There is some truth in what you say?  Well, yes!"
161,PART I,Your statements usually hold more or less.
162,PART I,Some women write weak letters—(some men do;)
163,PART I,"Some make professions, knowing them untrue."
164,PART I,"And woman’s friendship, in the time of need,"
165,PART I,"I own, too often proves a broken reed."
166,PART I,"But I believe, and ever will contend,"
167,PART I,"Woman can be a sister woman’s friend,"
168,PART I,Giving from out her large heart’s bounteous store
169,PART I,A living love—claiming to do no more
170,PART I,"Than, through and by that love, she knows she can:"
171,PART I,"And living by her professions, _like a man_."
172,PART I,"And such a tie, true friendship’s silken tether,"
173,PART I,Binds Helen Trevor’s heart and mine together.
174,PART I,"I love her for her beauty, meekness, grace;"
175,PART I,For her white lily soul and angel face.
176,PART I,"She loves me, for my greater strength, maybe;"
177,PART I,Loves—and would give her heart’s best blood for me.
178,PART I,"And I, to save her from a pain, or cross,"
179,PART I,Would suffer any sacrifice or loss.
180,PART I,Such can be woman’s friendship for another.
181,PART I,"Could man give more, or ask more from a brother?”"
182,PART I,
183,PART I,I paused: and Vivian leaned his massive head
184,PART I,"Against the pillar of the portico,"
185,PART I,"Smiled his slow, sceptic smile, then laughed, and said:"
186,PART I,"“Nay, surely not—if what you say be so."
187,PART I,"You’ve made a statement, but no proof’s at hand."
188,PART I,Wait—do not flash your eyes so!  Understand
189,PART I,I think you quite sincere in what you say:
190,PART I,"You love your friend, and she loves you, to-day;"
191,PART I,But friendship is not friendship at the best
192,PART I,Till circumstances put it to the test.
193,PART I,"Man’s, less demonstrative, stands strain and tear,"
194,PART I,"While woman’s, half profession, fails to wear."
195,PART I,Two women love each other passing well—
196,PART I,"Say Helen Trevor and Maurine La Pelle,"
197,PART I,Just for example.
198,PART I,Let them daily meet
199,PART I,"At ball and concert, in the church and street,"
200,PART I,"They kiss and coo, they visit, chat, caress;"
201,PART I,"Their love increases, rather than grows less;"
202,PART I,"And all goes well, till ‘Helen dear’ discovers"
203,PART I,That ‘Maurine darling’ wins too many lovers.
204,PART I,
205,PART I,"And then her ‘precious friend,’ her ‘pet,’ her ‘sweet,’"
206,PART I,"Becomes a ‘minx,’ a ‘creature all deceit.’"
207,PART I,"Let Helen smile too oft on Maurine’s beaux,"
208,PART I,"Or wear more stylish or becoming clothes,"
209,PART I,Or sport a hat that has a longer feather—
210,PART I,And lo! the strain has broken ‘friendship’s tether.’
211,PART I,Maurine’s sweet smile becomes a frown or pout;
212,PART I,‘She’s just begun to find that Helen out.’
213,PART I,The breach grows wider—anger fills each heart;
214,PART I,"They drift asunder, whom ‘but death could part.’"
215,PART I,"You shake your head?  Oh, well, we’ll never know!"
216,PART I,It is not likely Fate will test you so.
217,PART I,"You’ll live, and love; and, meeting twice a year,"
218,PART I,"While life shall last, you’ll hold each other dear."
219,PART I,I pray it may be so; it were not best
220,PART I,To shake your faith in woman by the test.
221,PART I,"Keep your belief, and nurse it while you can."
222,PART I,I’ve faith in woman’s friendship too—for man!
223,PART I,"They’re true as steel, as mothers, friends, and wives:"
224,PART I,And that’s enough to bless us all our lives.
225,PART I,"That man’s a selfish fellow, and a bore,"
226,PART I,Who is unsatisfied and asks for more.”
227,PART I,
228,PART I,“But there is need of more!” I here broke in.
229,PART I,"“I hold that woman guilty of a sin,"
230,PART I,"Who would not cling to, and defend another,"
231,PART I,As nobly as she would stand by a brother.
232,PART I,"Who would not suffer for a sister’s sake,"
233,PART I,"And, were there need to prove her friendship, make"
234,PART I,"‘Most any sacrifice, nor count the cost."
235,PART I,Who would not do this for a friend is lost
236,PART I,To every nobler principle.”
237,PART I,"“Shame, shame!”"
238,PART I,"Cried Vivian, laughing, “for you now defame"
239,PART I,The whole sweet sex; since there’s not one would do
240,PART I,"The thing you name, nor would I want her to."
241,PART I,I love the sex.  My mother was a woman—
242,PART I,"I hope my wife will be, and wholly human."
243,PART I,"And if she wants to make some sacrifice,"
244,PART I,I’ll think her far more sensible and wise
245,PART I,"To let her husband reap the benefit,"
246,PART I,Instead of some old maid or senseless chit.
247,PART I,Selfish?  Of course!  I hold all love is so:
248,PART I,"And I shall love my wife right well, I know."
249,PART I,"Now there’s a point regarding selfish love,"
250,PART I,"You thirst to argue with me, and disprove."
251,PART I,"But since these cosy hours will soon be gone,"
252,PART I,"And all our meetings broken in upon,"
253,PART I,No more of these rare moments must be spent
254,PART I,"In vain discussions, or in argument."
255,PART I,I wish Miss Trevor was in—Jericho!
256,PART I,(You see the selfishness begins to show.)
257,PART I,She wants to see you?—So do I: but she
258,PART I,"Will gain her wish, by taking you from me."
259,PART I,‘Come all the same?’ that means I’ll be allowed
260,PART I,To realize that ‘three can make a crowd.’
261,PART I,I do not like to feel myself _de trop_.
262,PART I,With two girl cronies would I not be so?
263,PART I,My ring would interrupt some private chat.
264,PART I,"You’d ask me in and take my cane and hat,"
265,PART I,"And speak about the lovely summer day,"
266,PART I,And think—‘The lout!  I wish he’d kept away.’
267,PART I,"Miss Trevor’d smile, but just to hide a pout"
268,PART I,And count the moments till I was shown out.
269,PART I,"And, while I twirled my thumbs, I would sit wishing"
270,PART I,"That I had gone off hunting birds, or fishing,"
271,PART I,"No, thanks, Maurine!  The iron hand of Fate,"
272,PART I,"(Or otherwise Miss Trevor’s dainty fingers,)"
273,PART I,Will bar my entrance into Eden’s gate;
274,PART I,And I shall be like some poor soul that lingers
275,PART I,"At heaven’s portal, paying the price of sin,"
276,PART I,Yet hoping to be pardoned and let in.”
277,PART I,
278,PART I,"He looked so melancholy sitting there,"
279,PART I,I laughed outright.  “How well you act a part;
280,PART I,You look the very picture of despair!
281,PART I,"You’ve missed your calling, sir! suppose you start"
282,PART I,"Upon a starring tour, and carve your name"
283,PART I,With Booth’s and Barrett’s on the heights of Fame
284,PART I,"But now, tabooing nonsense, I shall send"
285,PART I,"For you to help me entertain my friend,"
286,PART I,"Unless you come without it.  ‘Cronies?’  True,"
287,PART I,Wanting our ‘private chats’ as cronies do.
288,PART I,"And we’ll take those, while you are reading Greek,"
289,PART I,Or writing ‘Lines to Dora’s brow’ or ‘cheek.’
290,PART I,"But when you have an hour or two of leisure,"
291,PART I,"Call as you now do, and afford like pleasure."
292,PART I,"For never yet did heaven’s sun shine on,"
293,PART I,"Or stars discover, that phenomenon,"
294,PART I,"In any country, or in any clime:"
295,PART I,"Two maids so bound, by ties of mind and heart,"
296,PART I,They did not feel the heavy weight of time
297,PART I,In weeks of scenes wherein no man took part.
298,PART I,God made the sexes to associate:
299,PART I,"Nor law of man, nor stern decree of Fate,"
300,PART I,"Can ever undo what His hand has done,"
301,PART I,"And, quite alone, make happy either one."
302,PART I,My Helen is an only child:—a pet
303,PART I,Of loving parents: and she never yet
304,PART I,Has been denied one boon for which she pleaded.
305,PART I,"A fragile thing, her lightest wish was heeded."
306,PART I,"Would she pluck roses?  They must first be shorn,"
307,PART I,"By careful hands, of every hateful thorn,"
308,PART I,And loving eyes must scan the pathway where
309,PART I,"Her feet may tread, to see no stones are there."
310,PART I,"She’ll grow dull here, in this secluded nook,"
311,PART I,Unless you aid me in the pleasant task
312,PART I,Of entertaining.  Drop in with your book—
313,PART I,"Read, talk, sing for her sometimes.  What I ask,"
314,PART I,"Do once, to please me: then there’ll be no need"
315,PART I,"For me to state the case again, or plead."
316,PART I,There’s nothing like a woman’s grace and beauty
317,PART I,To waken mankind to a sense of duty.”
318,PART I,
319,PART I,“I bow before the mandate of my queen:
320,PART I,"Your slightest wish is law, Ma Belle Maurine,”"
321,PART I,"He answered, smiling, “I’m at your command;"
322,PART I,"Point but one lily finger, or your wand,"
323,PART I,And you will find a willing slave obeying.
324,PART I,There goes my dinner bell!  I hear it saying
325,PART I,"I’ve spent two hours here, lying at your feet,"
326,PART I,"Not profitable, maybe—surely sweet."
327,PART I,All time is money; now were I to measure
328,PART I,"The time I spend here by its solid pleasure,"
329,PART I,"And that were coined in dollars, then I’ve laid"
330,PART I,"Each day a fortune at your feet, fair maid."
331,PART I,"There goes that bell again!  I’ll say good-bye,"
332,PART I,Or clouds will shadow my domestic sky.
333,PART I,"I’ll come again, as you would have me do,"
334,PART I,"And see your friend, while she is seeing you."
335,PART I,That’s like by proxy being at a feast;
336,PART I,"Unsatisfactory, to say the least.”"
337,PART I,
338,PART I,"He drew his fine shape up, and trod the land"
339,PART I,"With kingly grace.  Passing the gate, his hand"
340,PART I,"He lightly placed the garden wall upon,"
341,PART I,"Leaped over like a leopard, and was gone."
342,PART I,
343,PART I,"And, going, took the brightness from the place,"
344,PART I,"Yet left the June day with a sweeter grace,"
345,PART I,"And my young soul, so steeped in happy dreams,"
346,PART I,Heaven itself seemed shown to me in gleams.
347,PART I,"There is a time with lovers, when the heart"
348,PART I,"First slowly rouses from its dreamless sleep,"
349,PART I,"To all the tumult of a passion life,"
350,PART I,Ere yet have wakened jealousy and strife.
351,PART I,"Just as a young, untutored child will start"
352,PART I,"Out of a long hour’s slumber, sound and deep,"
353,PART I,"And lie and smile with rosy lips and cheeks,"
354,PART I,"In a sweet, restful trance, before it speaks."
355,PART I,"A time when yet no word the spell has broken,"
356,PART I,"Save what the heart unto the soul has spoken,"
357,PART I,"In quickened throbs, and sighs but half suppressed"
358,PART I,"A time when that sweet truth, all unconfessed,"
359,PART I,"Gives added fragrance to the summer flowers,"
360,PART I,"A golden glory to the passing hours,"
361,PART I,"A hopeful beauty to the plainest face,"
362,PART I,And lends to life a new and tender grace.
363,PART I,"When the full heart has climbed the heights of bliss,"
364,PART I,"And, smiling, looks back o’er the golden past,"
365,PART I,I think it finds no sweeter hour than this
366,PART I,"In all love-life.  For, later, when the last"
367,PART I,"Translucent drop o’erflows the cup of joy,"
368,PART I,"And love, more mighty than the heart’s control,"
369,PART I,"Surges in words of passion from the soul,"
370,PART I,"And vows are asked and given, shadows rise"
371,PART I,"Like mists before the sun in noonday skies,"
372,PART I,"Vague fears, that prove the brimming cup’s alloy;"
373,PART I,"A dread of change—the crowning moment’s curse,"
374,PART I,"Since what is perfect, change but renders worse:"
375,PART I,"A vain desire to cripple Time, who goes"
376,PART I,"Bearing our joys away, and bringing woes."
377,PART I,"And later, doubts and jealousies awaken,"
378,PART I,And plighted hearts are tempest-tossed and shaken.
379,PART I,"Doubt sends a test, that goes a step too far,"
380,PART I,"A wound is made, that, healing, leaves a scar,"
381,PART I,"Or one heart, full with love’s sweet satisfaction,"
382,PART I,"Thinks truth once spoken always understood,"
383,PART I,While one is pining for the tender action
384,PART I,"And whispered word by which, of old, ’twas wooed."
385,PART I,
386,PART I,"But this blest hour, in love’s glad, golden day,"
387,PART I,"Is like the dawning, ere the radiant ray"
388,PART I,"Of glowing Sol has burst upon the eye,"
389,PART I,"But yet is heralded in earth and sky,"
390,PART I,"Warm with its fervour, mellow with its light,"
391,PART I,While Care still slumbers in the arms of night.
392,PART I,"But Hope, awake, hears happy birdlings sing,"
393,PART I,And thinks of all a summer day may bring.
394,PART I,
395,PART I,"In this sweet calm, my young heart lay at rest,"
396,PART I,Filled with a blissful sense of peace; nor guessed
397,PART I,That sullen clouds were gathering in the skies
398,PART I,"To hide the glorious sun, ere it should rise."
399,PART I,
400,PART I,
401,PART I,
402,PART II,PART II
403,PART II,
404,PART II,
405,PART II,To little birds that never tire of humming
406,PART II,"About the garden in the summer weather,"
407,PART II,"Aunt Ruth compared us, after Helen’s coming,"
408,PART II,"As we two roamed, or sat and talked together."
409,PART II,"Twelve months apart, we had so much to say"
410,PART II,Of school days gone—and time since passed away;
411,PART II,"Of that old friend, and this; of what we’d done;"
412,PART II,Of how our separate paths in life had run;
413,PART II,"Of what we would do, in the coming years;"
414,PART II,"Of plans and castles, hopes and dreams and fears."
415,PART II,"All these, and more, as soon as we found speech,"
416,PART II,"We touched upon, and skimmed from this to that."
417,PART II,"But at the first each only gazed on each,"
418,PART II,"And, dumb with joy, that did not need a voice"
419,PART II,"Like lesser joys, to say, “Lo!  I rejoice,”"
420,PART II,With smiling eyes and clasping hands we sat
421,PART II,"Wrapped in that peace, felt but with those dear,"
422,PART II,Contented just to know each other near.
423,PART II,But when this silent eloquence gave place
424,PART II,"To words, ’twas like the rising of a flood"
425,PART II,"Above a dam.  We sat there, face to face,"
426,PART II,"And let our talk glide on where’er it would,"
427,PART II,"Speech never halting in its speed or zest,"
428,PART II,Save when our rippling laughter let it rest;
429,PART II,Just as a stream will sometimes pause and play
430,PART II,"About a bubbling spring, then dash away."
431,PART II,"No wonder, then, the third day’s sun was nigh"
432,PART II,Up to the zenith when my friend and I
433,PART II,Opened our eyes from slumber long and deep:
434,PART II,Nature demanding recompense for hours
435,PART II,"Spent in the portico, among the flowers,"
436,PART II,Halves of two nights we should have spent in sleep.
437,PART II,
438,PART II,"So this third day, we breakfasted at one:"
439,PART II,"Then walked about the garden in the sun,"
440,PART II,"Hearing the thrushes and the robins sing,"
441,PART II,And looking to see what buds were opening.
442,PART II,
443,PART II,"The clock chimed three, and we yet strayed at will"
444,PART II,"About the yard in morning dishabille,"
445,PART II,"When Aunt Ruth came, with apron o’er her head,"
446,PART II,"Holding a letter in her hand, and said,"
447,PART II,"“Here is a note, from Vivian I opine;"
448,PART II,"At least his servant brought it.  And now, girls,"
449,PART II,"You may think this is no concern of mine,"
450,PART II,But in my day young ladies did not go
451,PART II,Till almost bed-time roaming to and fro
452,PART II,"In morning wrappers, and with tangled curls,"
453,PART II,The very pictures of forlorn distress.
454,PART II,"’Tis three o’clock, and time for you to dress."
455,PART II,"Come! read your note and hurry in, Maurine,"
456,PART II,And make yourself fit object to be seen.”
457,PART II,
458,PART II,"Helen was bending o’er an almond bush,"
459,PART II,"And ere she looked up I had read the note,"
460,PART II,"And calmed my heart, that, bounding, sent a flush"
461,PART II,"To brow and cheek, at sight of aught _he_ wrote."
462,PART II,"“Ma Belle Maurine:” (so Vivian’s billet ran,)"
463,PART II,“Is it not time I saw your cherished guest?
464,PART II,"‘Pity the sorrows of a poor young man,’"
465,PART II,Banished from all that makes existence blest.
466,PART II,I’m dying to see—your friend; and I will come
467,PART II,"And pay respects, hoping you’ll be at home"
468,PART II,"To-night at eight.  Expectantly, V. D.”"
469,PART II,
470,PART II,"Inside my belt I slipped the billet, saying,"
471,PART II,"“Helen, go make yourself most fair to see:"
472,PART II,Quick! hurry now! no time for more delaying!
473,PART II,"In just five hours a caller will be here,"
474,PART II,"And you must look your prettiest, my dear!"
475,PART II,Begin your toilet right away.  I know
476,PART II,How long it takes you to arrange each bow—
477,PART II,"To twist each curl, and loop your skirts aright."
478,PART II,"And you must prove you are _au fait_ to-night,"
479,PART II,And make a perfect toilet: for our caller
480,PART II,"Is man, and critic, poet, artist, scholar,"
481,PART II,And views with eyes of all.”
482,PART II,"“Oh, oh!  Maurine,”"
483,PART II,"Cried Helen with a well-feigned look of fear,"
484,PART II,“You’ve frightened me so I shall not appear:
485,PART II,"I’ll hide away, refusing to be seen"
486,PART II,By such an ogre.  Woe is me! bereft
487,PART II,"Of all my friends, my peaceful home I’ve left,"
488,PART II,And strayed away into the dreadful wood
489,PART II,To meet the fate of poor Red Riding Hood.
490,PART II,"No, Maurine, no! you’ve given me such a fright,"
491,PART II,I’ll not go near your ugly wolf to-night.”
492,PART II,
493,PART II,Meantime we’d left the garden; and I stood
494,PART II,"In Helen’s room, where she had thrown herself"
495,PART II,"Upon a couch, and lay, a winsome elf,"
496,PART II,"Pouting and smiling, cheek upon her arm,"
497,PART II,Not in the least a portrait of alarm.
498,PART II,"“Now, sweet!” I coaxed, and knelt by her, “be good!"
499,PART II,"Go curl your hair; and please your own Maurine,"
500,PART II,By putting on that lovely grenadine.
501,PART II,"Not wolf, nor ogre, neither Caliban,"
502,PART II,"Nor Mephistopheles, you’ll meet to-night,"
503,PART II,But what the ladies call ‘a nice young man’!
504,PART II,Yet one worth knowing—strong with health and might
505,PART II,"Of perfect manhood; gifted, noble, wise;"
506,PART II,"Moving among his kind with loving eyes,"
507,PART II,"And helpful hand; progressive, brave, refined,"
508,PART II,After the image of his Maker’s mind.”
509,PART II,
510,PART II,"“Now, now, Maurine!” cried Helen, “I believe"
511,PART II,It is your lover coming here this eve.
512,PART II,"Why have you never written of him, pray?"
513,PART II,"Is the day set?—and when?  Say, Maurine, say!”"
514,PART II,
515,PART II,Had I betrayed by some too fervent word
516,PART II,The secret love that all my being stirred?
517,PART II,My lover?  Ay!  My heart proclaimed him so;
518,PART II,"But first _his_ lips must win the sweet confession,"
519,PART II,Ere even Helen be allowed to know.
520,PART II,I must straightway erase the slight impression
521,PART II,Made by the words just uttered.
522,PART II,“Foolish child!”
523,PART II,"I gaily cried, “your fancy’s straying wild."
524,PART II,Just let a girl of eighteen hear the name
525,PART II,"Of maid and youth uttered about one time,"
526,PART II,"And off her fancy goes, at break-neck pace,"
527,PART II,"Defying circumstances, reason, space—"
528,PART II,And straightway builds romances so sublime
529,PART II,They put all Shakespeare’s dramas to the shame.
530,PART II,"This Vivian Dangerfield is neighbour, friend,"
531,PART II,And kind companion; bringing books and flowers.
532,PART II,"And, by his thoughtful actions without end,"
533,PART II,Helping me pass some otherwise long hours;
534,PART II,But he has never breathed a word of love.
535,PART II,"If you still doubt me, listen while I prove"
536,PART II,My statement by the letter that he wrote.
537,PART II,‘Dying to meet—my friend!’ (she could not see
538,PART II,The dash between that meant so much to me).
539,PART II,"‘Will come this eve, at eight, and hopes we may"
540,PART II,Be in to greet him.’  Now I think you’ll say
541,PART II,’Tis not much like a lover’s tender note.”
542,PART II,
543,PART II,"We laugh, we jest, not meaning what we say;"
544,PART II,"We hide our thoughts, by light words lightly spoken,"
545,PART II,"And pass on heedless, till we find one day"
546,PART II,"They’ve bruised our hearts, or left some other broken."
547,PART II,
548,PART II,"I sought my room, and trilling some blithe air,"
549,PART II,"Opened my wardrobe, wondering what to wear."
550,PART II,Momentous question! femininely human!
551,PART II,"More than all others, vexing mind of woman,"
552,PART II,"Since that sad day, when in her discontent,"
553,PART II,"To search for leaves, our fair first mother went."
554,PART II,"All undecided what I should put on,"
555,PART II,At length I made selection of a lawn—
556,PART II,"White, with a tiny pink vine overrun:—"
557,PART II,"My simplest robe, but Vivian’s favourite one."
558,PART II,"And placing a single flowret in my hair,"
559,PART II,"I crossed the hall to Helen’s chamber, where"
560,PART II,"I found her with her fair locks all let down,"
561,PART II,"Brushing the kinks out, with a pretty frown."
562,PART II,"’Twas like a picture, or a pleasing play,"
563,PART II,"To watch her make her toilet.  She would stand,"
564,PART II,"And turn her head first this, and then that way,"
565,PART II,"Trying effect of ribbon, bow or band."
566,PART II,"Then she would pick up something else, and curve"
567,PART II,"Her lovely neck, with cunning, bird-like grace,"
568,PART II,"And watch the mirror while she put it on,"
569,PART II,With such a sweetly grave and thoughtful face;
570,PART II,And then to view it all would sway and swerve
571,PART II,"Her lithe young body, like a graceful swan."
572,PART II,
573,PART II,"Helen was over medium height, and slender"
574,PART II,"Even to frailty.  Her great, wistful eyes"
575,PART II,Were like the deep blue of autumnal skies;
576,PART II,"And through them looked her soul, large, loving, tender."
577,PART II,"Her long, light hair was lustreless, except"
578,PART II,"Upon the ends, where burnished sunbeams slept,"
579,PART II,And on the earlocks; and she looped the curls
580,PART II,"Back with a shell comb, studded thick with pearls,"
581,PART II,"Costly yet simple.  Her pale loveliness,"
582,PART II,"That night, was heightened by her rich, black dress,"
583,PART II,"That trailed behind her, leaving half in sight"
584,PART II,"Her taper arms, and shoulders marble white."
585,PART II,
586,PART II,"I was not tall as Helen, and my face"
587,PART II,Was shaped and coloured like my grandsire’s race;
588,PART II,"For through his veins my own received the warm,"
589,PART II,"Red blood of Southern France, which curved my form,"
590,PART II,"And glowed upon my cheek in crimson dyes,"
591,PART II,"And bronzed my hair, and darkled in my eyes."
592,PART II,"And as the morning trails the skirts of night,"
593,PART II,"And dusky night puts on the garb of morn,"
594,PART II,"And walk together when the day is born,"
595,PART II,"So we two glided down the hall and stair,"
596,PART II,"Arm clasping arm, into the parlour, where"
597,PART II,"Sat Vivian, bathed in sunset’s gorgeous light."
598,PART II,He rose to greet us.  Oh! his form was grand;
599,PART II,"And he possessed that power, strange, occult,"
600,PART II,"Called magnetism, lacking better word,"
601,PART II,"Which moves the world, achieving great result"
602,PART II,"Where genius fails completely.  Touch his hand,"
603,PART II,"It thrilled through all your being—meet his eye,"
604,PART II,"And you were moved, yet knew not how, or why."
605,PART II,"Let him but rise, you felt the air was stirred"
606,PART II,By an electric current.
607,PART II,
608,PART II,This strange force
609,PART II,"Is mightier than genius.  Rightly used,"
610,PART II,It leads to grand achievements; all things yield
611,PART II,"Before its mystic presence, and its field"
612,PART II,"Is broad as earth and heaven.  But abused,"
613,PART II,"It sweeps like a poison simoon on its course,"
614,PART II,"Bearing miasma in its scorching breath,"
615,PART II,And leaving all it touches struck with death.
616,PART II,
617,PART II,Far-reaching science shall yet tear away
618,PART II,"The mystic garb that hides it from the day,"
619,PART II,"And drag it forth and bind it with its laws,"
620,PART II,"And make it serve the purposes of men,"
621,PART II,Guided by common-sense and reason.  Then
622,PART II,"We’ll hear no more of séance, table-rapping,"
623,PART II,"And all that trash, o’er which the world is gaping,"
624,PART II,"Lost in effect, while science seeks the cause."
625,PART II,
626,PART II,Vivian was not conscious of his power:
627,PART II,"Or, if he was, knew not its full extent."
628,PART II,"He knew his glance would make a wild beast cower,"
629,PART II,And yet he knew not that his large eyes sent
630,PART II,Into the heart of woman the same thrill
631,PART II,That made the lion servant of his will.
632,PART II,And even strong men felt it.
633,PART II,
634,PART II,"He arose,"
635,PART II,"Reached forth his hand, and in it clasped my own,"
636,PART II,While I held Helen’s; and he spoke some word
637,PART II,"Of pleasant greeting in his low, round tone,"
638,PART II,Unlike all other voices I have heard.
639,PART II,"Just as the white cloud, at the sunrise, glows"
640,PART II,"With roseate colours, so the pallid hue"
641,PART II,"Of Helen’s cheek, like tinted sea-shells grew."
642,PART II,"Through mine, his hand caused hers to tremble; such"
643,PART II,Was the all-mast’ring magic of his touch.
644,PART II,"Then we sat down, and talked about the weather,"
645,PART II,The neighbourhood—some author’s last new book.
646,PART II,"But, when I could, I left the two together"
647,PART II,"To make acquaintance, saying I must look"
648,PART II,After the chickens—my especial care;
649,PART II,"And ran away and left them, laughing, there."
650,PART II,
651,PART II,"Knee-deep, through clover, to the poplar grove,"
652,PART II,"I waded, where my pets were wont to rove:"
653,PART II,And there I found the foolish mother hen
654,PART II,"Brooding her chickens underneath a tree,"
655,PART II,"An easy prey for foxes.  “Chick-a-dee,”"
656,PART II,"Quoth I, while reaching for the downy things"
657,PART II,"That, chirping, peeped from out the mother-wings,"
658,PART II,“How very human is your folly!  When
659,PART II,"There waits a haven, pleasant, bright, and warm,"
660,PART II,And one to lead you thither from the storm
661,PART II,"And lurking dangers, yet you turn away,"
662,PART II,"And, thinking to be your own protector, stray"
663,PART II,"Into the open jaws of death: for, see!"
664,PART II,An owl is sitting in this very tree
665,PART II,You thought safe shelter.  Go now to your pen.”
666,PART II,"And, followed by the clucking, clamorous hen,"
667,PART II,"So like the human mother here again,"
668,PART II,"Moaning because a strong, protecting arm"
669,PART II,"Would shield her little ones from cold and harm,"
670,PART II,I carried back my garden hat brimful
671,PART II,"Of chirping chickens, like white balls of wool"
672,PART II,And snugly housed them.
673,PART II,
674,PART II,And just then I heard
675,PART II,"A sound like gentle winds among the trees,"
676,PART II,"Or pleasant waters in the summer, stirred"
677,PART II,And set in motion by a passing breeze.
678,PART II,"’Twas Helen singing: and, as I drew near,"
679,PART II,"Another voice, a tenor full and clear,"
680,PART II,"Mingled with hers, as murmuring streams unite,"
681,PART II,And flow on stronger in their wedded might.
682,PART II,
683,PART II,"It was a way of Helen’s, not to sing"
684,PART II,The songs that other people sang.  She took
685,PART II,Sometimes an extract from an ancient book;
686,PART II,"Again some floating, fragmentary thing."
687,PART II,"And such she fitted to old melodies,"
688,PART II,Or else composed the music.  One of these
689,PART II,"She sang that night; and Vivian caught the strain,"
690,PART II,"And joined her in the chorus, or refrain,"
691,PART II,
692,PART II,
693,SONG.,SONG.
694,SONG.,
695,SONG.,
696,SONG.,"Oh thou, mine other, stronger part!"
697,SONG.,"Whom yet I cannot hear, or see,"
698,SONG.,"Come thou, and take this loving heart,"
699,SONG.,"That longs to yield its all to thee,"
700,SONG.,"I call mine own—oh, come to me!"
701,SONG.,"Love, answer back, I come to thee,"
702,SONG.,I come to thee.
703,SONG.,
704,SONG.,"This hungry heart, so warm, so large,"
705,SONG.,Is far too great a care for me.
706,SONG.,I have grown weary of the charge
707,SONG.,I keep so sacredly for thee.
708,SONG.,"Come thou, and take my heart from me."
709,SONG.,"Love, answer back, I come to thee,"
710,SONG.,I come to thee.
711,SONG.,
712,SONG.,"I am a-weary, waiting here"
713,SONG.,For one who tarries long from me.
714,SONG.,"Oh! art thou far, or art thou near?"
715,SONG.,And must I still be sad for thee?
716,SONG.,Or wilt thou straightway come to me?
717,SONG.,"Love, answer, I am near to thee,"
718,SONG.,I come to thee.
719,SONG.,
720,SONG.,"The melody, so full of plaintive chords,"
721,SONG.,Sobbed into silence—echoing down the strings
722,SONG.,"Like voice of one who walks from us, and sings."
723,SONG.,Vivian had leaned upon the instrument
724,SONG.,"The while they sang.  But, as he spoke those words,"
725,SONG.,"“Love, I am near to thee, I come to thee,”"
726,SONG.,"He turned his grand head slowly round, and bent"
727,SONG.,"His lustrous, soulful, speaking gaze on me."
728,SONG.,"And my young heart, eager to own its king,"
729,SONG.,"Sent to my eyes a great, glad, trustful light"
730,SONG.,"Of love and faith, and hung upon my cheek"
731,SONG.,Hope’s rose-hued flag.  There was no need to speak
732,SONG.,"I crossed the room, and knelt by Helen.  “Sing"
733,SONG.,That song you sang a fragment of one night
734,SONG.,"Out on the porch, beginning, ‘Praise me not,’”"
735,SONG.,I whispered: and her sweet and plaintive tone
736,SONG.,"Rose, low and tender, as if she had caught"
737,SONG.,"From some sad passing breeze, and made her own,"
738,SONG.,"The echo of the wind-harp’s sighing strain,"
739,SONG.,Or the soft music of the falling rain.
740,SONG.,
741,SONG.,
742,SONG.,SONG.
743,SONG.,
744,SONG.,
745,SONG.,"O praise me not with your lips, dear one!"
746,SONG.,Though your tender words I prize.
747,SONG.,But dearer by far is the soulful gaze
748,SONG.,"Of your eyes, your beautiful eyes,"
749,SONG.,"Your tender, loving eyes."
750,SONG.,
751,SONG.,"O chide me not with your lips, dear one!"
752,SONG.,Though I cause your bosom sighs.
753,SONG.,You can make repentance deeper far
754,SONG.,"By your sad, reproving eyes,"
755,SONG.,"Your sorrowful, troubled eyes."
756,SONG.,
757,SONG.,"Words, at the best, are but hollow sounds;"
758,SONG.,"Above, in the beaming skies,"
759,SONG.,"The constant stars say never a word,"
760,SONG.,But only smile with their eyes—
761,SONG.,Smile on with their lustrous eyes.
762,SONG.,
763,SONG.,"Then breathe no vow with your lips, dear one;"
764,SONG.,On the wingèd wind speech flies.
765,SONG.,But I read the truth of your noble heart
766,SONG.,"In your soulful, speaking eyes—"
767,SONG.,In your deep and beautiful eyes.
768,SONG.,
769,SONG.,"The twilight darkened, round us, in the room,"
770,SONG.,"While Helen sang; and, in the gathering gloom,"
771,SONG.,"Vivian reached out, and took my hand in his,"
772,SONG.,And held it so; while Helen made the air
773,SONG.,"Languid with music.  Then a step drew near,"
774,SONG.,And voice of Aunt Ruth broke the spell:
775,SONG.,“Dear! dear!
776,SONG.,"Why, Maurie, Helen, children! how is this?"
777,SONG.,"I hear you, but you have no light in there."
778,SONG.,Your room is dark as Egypt.  What a way
779,SONG.,"For folks to visit!  Maurie, go, I pray,"
780,SONG.,And order lamps.”
781,SONG.,"And so there came a light,"
782,SONG.,And all the sweet dreams hovering around
783,SONG.,The twilight shadows flitted in affright:
784,SONG.,And e’en the music had a harsher sound.
785,SONG.,In pleasant converse passed an hour away:
786,SONG.,And Vivian planned a picnic for next day—
787,SONG.,"A drive the next, and rambles without end,"
788,SONG.,That he might help me entertain my friend.
789,SONG.,"And then he rose, bowed low, and passed from sight,"
790,SONG.,Like some great star that drops out from the night;
791,SONG.,"And Helen watched him through the shadows go,"
792,SONG.,"And turned and said, her voice subdued and low,"
793,SONG.,"“How tall he is! in all my life, Maurine,"
794,SONG.,A grander man I never yet have seen.”

801,PART III,One golden twelfth-part of a checkered year;
802,PART III,"One summer month, of sunlight, moonlight, mirth,"
803,PART III,"With not a hint of shadows lurking near,"
804,PART III,Or storm-clouds brewing.
805,PART III,
806,PART III,’Twas a royal day:
807,PART III,"Voluptuous July held her lover, Earth,"
808,PART III,"With her warm arms, upon her glowing breast,"
809,PART III,"And twined herself about him, as he lay"
810,PART III,Smiling and panting in his dream-stirred rest.
811,PART III,"She bound him with her limbs of perfect grace,"
812,PART III,"And hid him with her trailing robe of green,"
813,PART III,"And wound him in her long hair’s shimmering sheen,"
814,PART III,And rained her ardent kisses on his face.
815,PART III,Through the glad glory of the summer land
816,PART III,"Helen and I went wandering, hand in hand."
817,PART III,"In winding paths, hard by the ripe wheat-field,"
818,PART III,"White with the promise of a bounteous yield,"
819,PART III,"Across the late shorn meadow—down the hill,"
820,PART III,"Red with the tiger-lily blossoms, till"
821,PART III,"We stood upon the borders of the lake,"
822,PART III,"That like a pretty, placid infant, slept"
823,PART III,Low at its base: and little ripples crept
824,PART III,"Along its surface, just as dimples chase"
825,PART III,Each other o’er an infant’s sleeping face.
826,PART III,Helen in idle hours had learned to make
827,PART III,"A thousand pretty, feminine knick-knacks:"
828,PART III,"For brackets, ottomans, and toilet stands—"
829,PART III,Labour just suited to her dainty hands.
830,PART III,"That morning she had been at work in wax,"
831,PART III,"Moulding a wreath of flowers for my room,—"
832,PART III,"Taking her patterns from the living blows,"
833,PART III,"In all their dewy beauty and sweet bloom,"
834,PART III,"Fresh from my garden.  Fuchsia, tulip, rose,"
835,PART III,"And trailing ivy, grew beneath her touch,"
836,PART III,Resembling the living plants as much
837,PART III,As life is copied in the form of death:
838,PART III,"These lacking but the perfume, and that, breath."
839,PART III,
840,PART III,"And now the wreath was all completed, save"
841,PART III,"The mermaid blossom of all flowerdom,"
842,PART III,"A water-lily, dripping from the wave."
843,PART III,And ’twas in search of it that we had come
844,PART III,"Down to the lake, and wandered on the beach,"
845,PART III,To see if any lilies grew in reach.
846,PART III,"Some broken stalks, where flowers late had been;"
847,PART III,"Some buds, with all their beauties folded in,"
848,PART III,"We found, but not the treasure that we sought."
849,PART III,And then we turned our footsteps to the spot
850,PART III,"Where, all impatient of its chain, my boat,"
851,PART III,"The _Swan_, rocked, asking to be set afloat."
852,PART III,"It was a dainty row-boat—strong, yet light;"
853,PART III,Each side a swan was painted snowy white:
854,PART III,"A present from my uncle, just before"
855,PART III,"He sailed, with Death, to that mysterious strand,"
856,PART III,"Where freighted ships go sailing evermore,"
857,PART III,But none return to tell us of the land.
858,PART III,"I freed the _Swan_, and slowly rowed about,"
859,PART III,"Wherever sea-weeds, grass, or green leaves lifted"
860,PART III,"Their tips above the water.  So we drifted,"
861,PART III,"While Helen, opposite, leaned idly out"
862,PART III,"And watched for lilies in the waves below,"
863,PART III,"And softly crooned some sweet and dreamy air,"
864,PART III,That soothed me like a mother’s lullabies.
865,PART III,"I dropped the oars, and closed my sun-kissed eyes,"
866,PART III,And let the boat go drifting here and there.
867,PART III,"Oh, happy day! the last of that brief time"
868,PART III,"Of thoughtless youth, when all the world seems bright,"
869,PART III,Ere that disguisèd angel men call Woe
870,PART III,"Leads the sad heart through valleys dark as night,"
871,PART III,Up to the heights exalted and sublime.
872,PART III,"On each blest, happy moment, I am fain"
873,PART III,"To linger long, ere I pass on to pain"
874,PART III,And sorrow that succeeded.
875,PART III,
876,PART III,"From day-dreams,"
877,PART III,"As golden as the summer noontide’s beams,"
878,PART III,I was awakened by a voice that cried:
879,PART III,"“Strange ship, ahoy!  Fair frigate, whither bound?”"
880,PART III,"And, starting up, I cast my gaze around,"
881,PART III,And saw a sail-boat o’er the water glide
882,PART III,"Close to the _Swan_, like some live thing of grace;"
883,PART III,"And from it looked the glowing, handsome face"
884,PART III,Of Vivian.
885,PART III,
886,PART III,"“Beauteous sirens of the sea,"
887,PART III,Come sail across the raging main with me!”
888,PART III,"He laughed; and leaning, drew our drifting boat"
889,PART III,"Beside his own.  “There, now! step in!” he said;"
890,PART III,“I’ll land you anywhere you want to go—
891,PART III,"My boat is safer far than yours, I know:"
892,PART III,And much more pleasant with its sails all spread.
893,PART III,"The _Swan_?  We’ll take the oars, and let it float"
894,PART III,"Ashore at leisure.  You, Maurine, sit there—"
895,PART III,Miss Helen here.  Ye gods and little fishes!
896,PART III,"I’ve reached the height of pleasure, and my wishes."
897,PART III,Adieu despondency! farewell to care!”
898,PART III,
899,PART III,’Twas done so quickly: that was Vivian’s way.
900,PART III,He did not wait for either yea or nay.
901,PART III,"He gave commands, and left you with no choice"
902,PART III,But just to do the bidding of his voice.
903,PART III,"His rare, kind smile, low tones, and manly face"
904,PART III,Lent to his quick imperiousness a grace
905,PART III,"And winning charm, completely stripping it"
906,PART III,Of what might otherwise have seemed unfit.
907,PART III,"Leaving no trace of tyranny, but just"
908,PART III,"That nameless force that seemed to say, “You must.”"
909,PART III,"Suiting its pretty title of the _Dawn_,"
910,PART III,"(So named, he said, that it might rhyme with _Swan_),"
911,PART III,"Vivian’s sail-boat was carpeted with blue,"
912,PART III,While all its sails were of a pale rose hue.
913,PART III,The daintiest craft that flirted with the breeze;
914,PART III,A poet’s fancy in an hour of ease.
915,PART III,
916,PART III,Whatever Vivian had was of the best.
917,PART III,His room was like some Sultan’s in the East.
918,PART III,"His board was always spread as for a feast,"
919,PART III,"Whereat, each meal, he was both host and guest."
920,PART III,He would go hungry sooner than he’d dine
921,PART III,At his own table if ’twere illy set.
922,PART III,He so loved things artistic in design—
923,PART III,"Order and beauty, all about him.  Yet"
924,PART III,"So kind he was, if it befell his lot"
925,PART III,"To dine within the humble peasant’s cot,"
926,PART III,"He made it seem his native soil to be,"
927,PART III,And thus displayed the true gentility.
928,PART III,
929,PART III,"Under the rosy banners of the _Dawn_,"
930,PART III,"Around the lake we drifted on, and on."
931,PART III,"It was a time for dreams, and not for speech."
932,PART III,"And so we floated on in silence, each"
933,PART III,Weaving the fancies suiting such a day.
934,PART III,"Helen leaned idly o’er the sail-boat’s side,"
935,PART III,And dipped her rosy fingers in the tide;
936,PART III,"And I among the cushions half reclined,"
937,PART III,"Half sat, and watched the fleecy clouds at play,"
938,PART III,"While Vivian with his blank-book, opposite,"
939,PART III,"In which he seemed to either sketch or write,"
940,PART III,Was lost in inspiration of some kind.
941,PART III,
942,PART III,"No time, no change, no scene, can e’er efface"
943,PART III,My mind’s impression of that hour and place;
944,PART III,"It stands out like a picture.  O’er the years,"
945,PART III,"Black with their robes of sorrow—veiled with tears,"
946,PART III,"Lying with all their lengthened shapes between,"
947,PART III,"Untouched, undimmed, I still behold that scene."
948,PART III,"Just as the last of Indian-summer days,"
949,PART III,"Replete with sunlight, crowned with amber haze,"
950,PART III,"Followed by dark and desolate December,"
951,PART III,Through all the months of winter we remember.
952,PART III,
953,PART III,The sun slipped westward.  That peculiar change
954,PART III,"Which creeps into the air, and speaks of night"
955,PART III,"While yet the day is full of golden light,"
956,PART III,We felt steal o’er us.
957,PART III,Vivian broke the spell
958,PART III,"Of dream-fraught silence, throwing down his book:"
959,PART III,"“Young ladies, please allow me to arrange"
960,PART III,These wraps about your shoulders.  I know well
961,PART III,"The fickle nature of our atmosphere,—"
962,PART III,"Her smile swift followed by a frown or tear,—"
963,PART III,"And go prepared for changes.  Now you look,"
964,PART III,"Like—like—oh, where’s a pretty simile?"
965,PART III,Had you a pocket mirror here you’d see
966,PART III,How well my native talent is displayed
967,PART III,In shawling you.  Red on the brunette maid;
968,PART III,Blue on the blonde—and quite without design
969,PART III,"(Oh, where _is_ that comparison of mine?)"
970,PART III,Well—like a June rose and a violet blue
971,PART III,In one bouquet!  I fancy that will do.
972,PART III,"And now I crave your patience and a boon,"
973,PART III,"Which is to listen, while I read my rhyme,"
974,PART III,A floating fancy of the summer time.
975,PART III,"’Tis neither witty, wonderful, nor wise,"
976,PART III,So listen kindly—but don’t criticise
977,PART III,My maiden effort of the afternoon:
978,PART III,
979,PART III,“If all the ships I have at sea
980,PART III,"Should come a-sailing home to me,"
981,PART III,"Ah, well! the harbour could not hold"
982,PART III,So many sails as there would be
983,PART III,If all my ships came in from sea.
984,PART III,
985,PART III,"“If half my ships came home from sea,"
986,PART III,"And brought their precious freight to me,"
987,PART III,"Ah, well!  I should have wealth as great"
988,PART III,As any king who sits in state—
989,PART III,So rich the treasures that would be
990,PART III,In half my ships now out at sea.
991,PART III,
992,PART III,“If just one ship I have at sea
993,PART III,"Should come a-sailing home to me,"
994,PART III,"Ah, well! the storm-clouds then might frown:"
995,PART III,For if the others all went down
996,PART III,"Still rich and proud and glad I’d be,"
997,PART III,If that one ship came back to me.
998,PART III,
999,PART III,"“If that one ship went down at sea,"
1000,PART III,"And all the others came to me,"
1001,PART III,"Weighed down with gems and wealth untold,"
1002,PART III,"With glory, honour, riches, gold,"
1003,PART III,The poorest soul on earth I’d be
1004,PART III,If that one ship came not to me.
1005,PART III,
1006,PART III,“O skies be calm!  O winds blow free—
1007,PART III,Blow all my ships safe home to me.
1008,PART III,But if thou sendest some a-wrack
1009,PART III,"To never more come sailing back,"
1010,PART III,"Send any—all that skim the sea,"
1011,PART III,But bring my love-ship home to me.”
1012,PART III,
1013,PART III,"Helen was leaning by me, and her head"
1014,PART III,"Rested against my shoulder: as he read,"
1015,PART III,"I stroked her hair, and watched the fleecy skies,"
1016,PART III,"And when he finished, did not turn my eyes."
1017,PART III,I felt too happy and too shy to meet
1018,PART III,"His gaze just then.  I said, “’Tis very sweet,"
1019,PART III,"And suits the day; does it not, Helen, dear?”"
1020,PART III,"But Helen, voiceless, did not seem to hear."
1021,PART III,"“’Tis strange,” I added, “how you poets sing"
1022,PART III,So feelingly about the very thing
1023,PART III,You care not for! and dress up an ideal
1024,PART III,"So well, it looks a living, breathing real!"
1025,PART III,"Now, to a listener, your love song seemed"
1026,PART III,A heart’s out-pouring; yet I’ve heard you say
1027,PART III,Almost the opposite; or that you deemed
1028,PART III,"Position, honour, glory, power, fame,"
1029,PART III,"Gained without loss of conscience or good name,"
1030,PART III,The things to live for.”
1031,PART III,"“Have you?  Well, you may,”"
1032,PART III,"Laughed Vivian, “but ’twas years—or months’ ago!"
1033,PART III,"And Solomon says wise men change, you know!"
1034,PART III,I now speak truth! if she I hold most dear
1035,PART III,"Slipped from my life, and no least hope were left,"
1036,PART III,My heart would find the years more lonely here
1037,PART III,"Than if I were of wealth, fame, friends, bereft,"
1038,PART III,"And sent, an exile, to a foreign land.”"
1039,PART III,"His voice was low, and measured: as he spoke,"
1040,PART III,"New, unknown chords of melody awoke"
1041,PART III,Within my soul.  I felt my heart expand
1042,PART III,With that sweet fulness born of love.  I turned
1043,PART III,"To hide the blushes on my cheek that burned,"
1044,PART III,"And leaning over Helen, breathed her name."
1045,PART III,She lay so motionless I thought she slept:
1046,PART III,"But, as I spoke, I saw her eyes unclose,"
1047,PART III,"And o’er her face a sudden glory swept,"
1048,PART III,And a slight tremor thrilled all through her frame.
1049,PART III,"“Sweet friend,” I said, “your face is full of light:"
1050,PART III,What were the dreams that made your eyes so bright?”
1051,PART III,"She only smiled for answer, and arose"
1052,PART III,"From her reclining posture at my side,"
1053,PART III,Threw back the clust’ring ringlets from her face
1054,PART III,"With a quick gesture, full of easy grace,"
1055,PART III,"And, turning, spoke to Vivian.  “Will you guide"
1056,PART III,The boat up near that little clump of green
1057,PART III,Off to the right?  There’s where the lilies grow.
1058,PART III,"We quite forgot our errand here, Maurine,"
1059,PART III,And our few moments have grown into hours.
1060,PART III,What will Aunt Ruth think of our ling’ring so?
1061,PART III,There—that will do—now I can reach the flowers.”
1062,PART III,
1063,PART III,"“Hark! just hear that!” and Vivian broke forth singing,"
1064,PART III,"“‘Row, brothers, row.’  The six o’clock bell’s ringing!"
1065,PART III,Who ever knew three hours to go so fast
1066,PART III,"In all the annals of the world, before?"
1067,PART III,I could have sworn not over one had passed.
1068,PART III,"Young ladies, I am forced to go ashore!"
1069,PART III,I thank you for the pleasure you have given;
1070,PART III,This afternoon has been a glimpse of heaven.
1071,PART III,"Good-night—sweet dreams! and by your gracious leave,"
1072,PART III,I’ll pay my compliments to-morrow eve.”
1073,PART III,
1074,PART III,"A smile, a bow, and he had gone his way:"
1075,PART III,"And, in the waning glory of the day,"
1076,PART III,"Down cool, green lanes, and through the length’ning shadows,"
1077,PART III,"Silent, we wandered back across the meadows."
1078,PART III,"The wreath was finished, and adorned my room;"
1079,PART III,"Long afterward, the lilies’ copied bloom"
1080,PART III,"Was like a horrid spectre in my sight,"
1081,PART III,"Staring upon me morning, noon, and night."
1082,PART III,
1083,PART III,"The sun went down.  The sad new moon rose up,"
1084,PART III,"And passed before me like an empty cup,"
1085,PART III,"The Great Unseen brims full of pain or bliss,"
1086,PART III,"And gives His children, saying, “Drink of this.”"
1087,PART III,
1088,PART III,"A light wind, from the open casement, fanned"
1089,PART III,"My brow and Helen’s, as we, hand in hand,"
1090,PART III,"Sat looking out upon the twilight scene,"
1091,PART III,"In dreamy silence.  Helen’s dark-blue eyes,"
1092,PART III,Like two lost stars that wandered from the skies
1093,PART III,"Some night adown the meteor’s shining track,"
1094,PART III,"And always had been grieving to go back,"
1095,PART III,"Now gazed up, wistfully, at heaven’s dome,"
1096,PART III,And seemed to recognise and long for home.
1097,PART III,"Her sweet voice broke the silence: “Wish, Maurine,"
1098,PART III,"Before you speak! you know the moon is new,"
1099,PART III,And anything you wish for will come true
1100,PART III,Before it wanes.  I do believe the sign!
1101,PART III,"Now tell me your wish, and I’ll tell you mine.”"
1102,PART III,
1103,PART III,I turned and looked up at the slim young moon;
1104,PART III,"And, with an almost superstitious heart,"
1105,PART III,"I sighed, “Oh, new moon! help me, by thine art,"
1106,PART III,"To grow all grace and goodness, and to be"
1107,PART III,Worthy the love a true heart proffers me.”
1108,PART III,"Then smiling down, I said, “Dear one! my boon,"
1109,PART III,"I fear, is quite too silly or too sweet"
1110,PART III,For my repeating: so we’ll let it stay
1111,PART III,Between the moon and me.  But if I may
1112,PART III,"I’ll listen now to your wish.  Tell me, please!”"
1113,PART III,
1114,PART III,"All suddenly she nestled at my feet,"
1115,PART III,And hid her blushing face upon my knees.
1116,PART III,"Then drew my hand against her glowing cheek,"
1117,PART III,"And, leaning on my breast, began to speak,"
1118,PART III,Half sighing out the words my tortured ear
1119,PART III,"Reached down to catch, while striving not to hear."
1120,PART III,
1121,PART III,"“Can you not guess who ’twas about, Maurine?"
1122,PART III,"Oh, my sweet friend! you must ere this have seen"
1123,PART III,The love I tried to cover from all eyes
1124,PART III,"And from myself.  Ah, foolish little heart!"
1125,PART III,As well it might go seeking for some art
1126,PART III,Whereby to hide the sun in noonday skies.
1127,PART III,"When first the strange sound of his voice I heard,"
1128,PART III,"Looked on his noble face, and, touched his hand,"
1129,PART III,My slumb’ring heart thrilled through and through and stirred
1130,PART III,"As if to say, ‘I hear, and understand.’"
1131,PART III,And day by day mine eyes were blest beholding
1132,PART III,"The inner beauty of his life, unfolding"
1133,PART III,In countless words and actions that portrayed
1134,PART III,The noble stuff of which his soul was made.
1135,PART III,And more and more I felt my heart upreaching
1136,PART III,"Toward the truth, drawn gently by his teaching,"
1137,PART III,As flowers are drawn by sunlight.  And there grew
1138,PART III,"A strange, shy something in its depths, I knew"
1139,PART III,"At length was love, because it was so sad"
1140,PART III,"And yet so sweet, and made my heart so glad,"
1141,PART III,"Yet seemed to pain me.  Then, for very shame,"
1142,PART III,"Lest all should read my secret and its name,"
1143,PART III,"I strove to hide it in my breast away,"
1144,PART III,Where God could see it only.  But each day
1145,PART III,"It seemed to grow within me, and would rise,"
1146,PART III,"Like my own soul, and look forth from my eyes,"
1147,PART III,"Defying bonds of silence; and would speak,"
1148,PART III,"In its red-lettered language, on my cheek,"
1149,PART III,"If but his name was uttered.  You were kind,"
1150,PART III,"My own Maurine! as you alone could be,"
1151,PART III,"So long the sharer of my heart and mind,"
1152,PART III,"While yet you saw, in seeming not to see."
1153,PART III,"In all the years we have been friends, my own,"
1154,PART III,"And loved as women very rarely do,"
1155,PART III,My heart no sorrow and no joy has known
1156,PART III,"It has not shared at once, in full, with you."
1157,PART III,"And I so longed to speak to you of this,"
1158,PART III,When first I felt its mingled pain and bliss;
1159,PART III,"Yet dared not, lest you, knowing him, should say,"
1160,PART III,In pity for my folly—‘Lack-a-day!
1161,PART III,You are undone: because no mortal art
1162,PART III,Can win the love of such a lofty heart.’
1163,PART III,"And so I waited, silent and in pain,"
1164,PART III,Till I could know I did not love in vain.
1165,PART III,"And now I know, beyond a doubt or fear."
1166,PART III,"Did he not say, ‘If she I hold most dear"
1167,PART III,"Slipped from my life, and no least hope were left,"
1168,PART III,My heart would find the years more lonely here
1169,PART III,"Than if I were of wealth, fame, friends, bereft,"
1170,PART III,"And sent, an exile, to a foreign land’?"
1171,PART III,"Oh, darling, you must _love_, to understand"
1172,PART III,The joy that thrilled all through me at those words.
1173,PART III,It was as if a thousand singing birds
1174,PART III,Within my heart broke forth in notes of praise.
1175,PART III,"I did not look up, but I knew his gaze"
1176,PART III,"Was on my face, and that his eyes must see"
1177,PART III,The joy I felt almost transfigured me.
1178,PART III,"He loves me—loves me! so the birds kept singing,"
1179,PART III,And all my soul with that sweet strain is ringing.
1180,PART III,"If there were added but one drop of bliss,"
1181,PART III,"No more my cup would hold: and so, this eve,"
1182,PART III,I made a wish that I might feel his kiss
1183,PART III,"Upon my lips, ere yon pale moon should leave"
1184,PART III,"The stars all lonely, having waned away,"
1185,PART III,Too old and weak and bowed with care to stay.”
1186,PART III,
1187,PART III,Her voice sighed in silence.  While she spoke
1188,PART III,"My heart writhed in me, praying she would cease—"
1189,PART III,Each word she uttered falling like a stroke
1190,PART III,"On my bare soul.  And now a hush like death,"
1191,PART III,"Save that ’twas broken by a quick-drawn breath,"
1192,PART III,"Fell ’round me, but brought not the hoped-for peace."
1193,PART III,"For when the lash no longer leaves its blows,"
1194,PART III,"The flesh still quivers, and the blood still flows."
1195,PART III,
1196,PART III,"She nestled on my bosom like a child,"
1197,PART III,And ’neath her head my tortured heart throbbed wild
1198,PART III,With pain and pity.  She had told her tale—
1199,PART III,Her self-deceiving story to the end.
1200,PART III,How could I look down on her as she lay
1201,PART III,"So fair, and sweet, and lily-like, and frail—"
1202,PART III,"A tender blossom on my breast, and say,"
1203,PART III,"“Nay, you are wrong—you do mistake, dear friend!"
1204,PART III,"’Tis I am loved, not you”?  Yet that were truth,"
1205,PART III,And she must know it later.
1206,PART III,"Should I speak,"
1207,PART III,And spread a ghastly pallor o’er the cheek
1208,PART III,"Flushed now with joy?  And while I, doubting pondered,"
1209,PART III,She spoke again.  “Maurine!  I oft have wondered
1210,PART III,Why you and Vivian were not lovers.  He
1211,PART III,Is all a heart could ask its king to be;
1212,PART III,"And you have beauty, intellect and youth."
1213,PART III,I think it strange you have not loved each other—
1214,PART III,Strange how he could pass by you for another
1215,PART III,Not half so fair or worthy.  Yet I know
1216,PART III,A loving Father pre-arranged it so.
1217,PART III,"I think my heart has known him all these years,"
1218,PART III,And waited for him.  And if when he came
1219,PART III,"It had been as a lover of my friend,"
1220,PART III,"I should have recognised him, all the same,"
1221,PART III,"As my soul-mate, and loved him to the end,"
1222,PART III,"Hiding my grief, and forcing back my tears"
1223,PART III,"Till on my heart, slow dropping, day by day,"
1224,PART III,"Unseen they fell, and wore it all away."
1225,PART III,"And so a tender Father kept him free,"
1226,PART III,"With all the largeness of his love, for me—"
1227,PART III,"For me, unworthy such a precious gift!"
1228,PART III,Yet I will bend each effort of my life
1229,PART III,"To grow in grace and goodness, and to lift"
1230,PART III,"My soul and spirit to his lofty height,"
1231,PART III,"So to deserve that holy name, his wife."
1232,PART III,"Sweet friend, it fills my whole heart with delight"
1233,PART III,To breathe its long hid secret in your ear.
1234,PART III,"Speak, my Maurine, and say you love to hear!”"
1235,PART III,
1236,PART III,"The while she spoke, my active brain gave rise"
1237,PART III,To one great thought of mighty sacrifice
1238,PART III,"And self-denial.  Oh! it blanched my cheek,"
1239,PART III,And wrung my soul; and from my heart it drove
1240,PART III,"All life and feeling.  Coward-like, I strove"
1241,PART III,To send it from me; but I felt it cling
1242,PART III,And hold fast on my mind like some live thing;
1243,PART III,And all the Self within me felt its touch
1244,PART III,"And cried, “No, no!  I cannot do so much—"
1245,PART III,I am not strong enough—there is no call.”
1246,PART III,"And then the voice of Helen bade me speak,"
1247,PART III,"And with a calmness born of nerve, I said,"
1248,PART III,"Scarce knowing what I uttered, “Sweetheart, all"
1249,PART III,Your joys and sorrows are with mine own wed.
1250,PART III,"I thank you for your confidence, and pray"
1251,PART III,"I may deserve it always.  But, dear one,"
1252,PART III,Something—perhaps our boat-ride in the sun—
1253,PART III,Has set my head to aching.  I must go
1254,PART III,"To bed directly; and you will, I know,"
1255,PART III,"Grant me your pardon, and another day"
1256,PART III,"We’ll talk of this together.  Now good-night,"
1257,PART III,And angels guard you with their wings of light.”
1258,PART III,
1259,PART III,"I kissed her lips, and held her on my heart,"
1260,PART III,And viewed her as I ne’er had done before.
1261,PART III,I gazed upon her features o’er and o’er;
1262,PART III,"Marked her white, tender face—her fragile form,"
1263,PART III,Like some frail plant that withers in the storm;
1264,PART III,Saw she was fairer in her new-found joy
1265,PART III,"Than e’er before; and thought, “Can I destroy"
1266,PART III,"God’s handiwork, or leave it at the best"
1267,PART III,"A broken harp, while I close clasp my bliss?”"
1268,PART III,"I bent my head and gave her one last kiss,"
1269,PART III,"And sought my room, and found there such relief"
1270,PART III,As sad hearts feel when first alone with grief.
1271,PART III,
1272,PART III,"The moon went down, slow sailing from my sight,"
1273,PART III,And left the stars to watch away the night.
1274,PART III,"O stars, sweet stars, so changeless and serene!"
1275,PART III,What depths of woe your pitying eyes have seen!
1276,PART III,"The proud sun sets, and leaves us with our sorrow,"
1277,PART III,To grope alone in darkness till the morrow.
1278,PART III,"The languid moon, e’en if she deigns to rise,"
1279,PART III,"Soon seeks her couch, grown weary of our sighs;"
1280,PART III,But from the early gloaming till the day
1281,PART III,Sends golden-liveried heralds forth to say
1282,PART III,"He comes in might; the patient stars shine on,"
1283,PART III,"Steadfast and faithful, from twilight to dawn."
1284,PART III,"And, as they shone upon Gethsemane,"
1285,PART III,"And watched the struggle of a God-like soul,"
1286,PART III,"Now from the same far height they shone on me,"
1287,PART III,And saw the waves of anguish o’er me roll.
1288,PART III,
1289,PART III,The storm had come upon me all unseen:
1290,PART III,No sound of thunder fell upon my ear;
1291,PART III,No cloud arose to tell me it was near;
1292,PART III,"But under skies all sunlit, and serene,"
1293,PART III,"I floated with the current of the stream,"
1294,PART III,And thought life all one golden-haloed dream.
1295,PART III,"When lo! a hurricane, with awful force,"
1296,PART III,"Swept swift upon its devastating course,"
1297,PART III,"Wrecked my frail bark, and cast me on the wave"
1298,PART III,Where all my hopes had found a sudden grave.
1299,PART III,Love makes us blind and selfish; otherwise
1300,PART III,I had seen Helen’s secret in her eyes;
1301,PART III,So used I was to reading every look
1302,PART III,"In her sweet face, as I would read a book."
1303,PART III,"But now, made sightless by love’s blinding rays,"
1304,PART III,"I had gone on unseeing, to the end"
1305,PART III,Where Pain dispelled the mist of golden haze
1306,PART III,"That walled me in, and lo!  I found my friend"
1307,PART III,Who journeyed with me—at my very side—
1308,PART III,"Had been sore wounded to the heart, while I,"
1309,PART III,"Both deaf and blind, saw not, nor heard her cry."
1310,PART III,"And then I sobbed, “O God!  I would have died"
1311,PART III,"To save her this.”  And as I cried in pain,"
1312,PART III,"There leaped forth from the still, white realm of Thought"
1313,PART III,"Where Conscience dwells, that unimpassioned spot"
1314,PART III,As widely different from the heart’s domain
1315,PART III,"As north from south—the impulse felt before,"
1316,PART III,"And put away; but now it rose once more,"
1317,PART III,"In greater strength, and said, “Heart, wouldst thou prove"
1318,PART III,"What lips have uttered?  Then go, lay thy love"
1319,PART III,"On Friendship’s altar, as thy offering.”"
1320,PART III,"“Nay!” cried my heart, “ask any other thing—"
1321,PART III,Ask life itself—’twere easier sacrifice.
1322,PART III,"But ask not love, for that I cannot give.”"
1323,PART III,
1324,PART III,"“But,” spoke the voice, “the meanest insect dies,"
1325,PART III,And is no hero! heroes dare to live
1326,PART III,When all that makes life sweet is snatched away.”
1327,PART III,"So with my heart, in converse, till the day,"
1328,PART III,"In gold and crimson billows, rose and broke,"
1329,PART III,"The voice of Conscience, all unwearied, spoke."
1330,PART III,"Love warred with Friendship, heart with Conscience fought,"
1331,PART III,"Hours rolled away, and yet the end was not."
1332,PART III,"And wily Self, tricked out like tenderness,"
1333,PART III,"Sighed, “Think how one, whose life thou wert to bless,"
1334,PART III,"Will be cast down, and grope in doubt and fear!"
1335,PART III,"Wouldst thou wound him, to give thy friend relief?"
1336,PART III,Can wrong make right?”
1337,PART III,"“Nay!” Conscience said, “but Pride"
1338,PART III,And Time can heal the saddest hurts of Love.
1339,PART III,"While Friendship’s wounds gape wide and yet more wide,"
1340,PART III,And bitter fountains of the spirit prove.”
1341,PART III,
1342,PART III,"At length, exhausted with the wearing strife,"
1343,PART III,I cast the new-found burden of my life
1344,PART III,"On God’s broad breast, and sought that deep repose"
1345,PART III,That only he who watched with sorrow knows.
1346,PART III,
1347,PART III,
1348,PART III,
1349,PART IV,PART IV
1350,PART IV,
1351,PART IV,
1352,PART IV,"“Maurine, Maurine, ’tis ten o’clock! arise,"
1353,PART IV,"My pretty sluggard, open those dark eyes"
1354,PART IV,And see where yonder sun is!  Do you know
1355,PART IV,I made my toilet just four hours ago?”
1356,PART IV,
1357,PART IV,’Twas Helen’s voice: and Helen’s gentle kiss
1358,PART IV,"Fell on my cheek.  As from a deep abyss,"
1359,PART IV,I drew my weary self from that strange sleep
1360,PART IV,That rests not nor refreshes.  Scarce awake
1361,PART IV,"Or conscious, yet there seemed a heavy weight"
1362,PART IV,"Bound on my breast, as by a cruel Fate."
1363,PART IV,"I knew not why, and yet I longed to weep."
1364,PART IV,Some dark cloud seemed to hang upon the day;
1365,PART IV,"And, for a moment, in that trance I lay,"
1366,PART IV,"When suddenly the truth did o’er me break,"
1367,PART IV,Like some great wave upon a helpless child.
1368,PART IV,The dull pain in my breast grew like a knife—
1369,PART IV,"The heavy throbbing of my heart grew wild,"
1370,PART IV,And God gave back the burden of the life
1371,PART IV,He kept what time I slumbered.
1372,PART IV,"“You are ill,”"
1373,PART IV,"Cried Helen, “with that blinding headache still!"
1374,PART IV,You look so pale and weary.  Now let me
1375,PART IV,"Play nurse, Maurine, and care for you to-day!"
1376,PART IV,"And first I’ll suit some dainty to your taste,"
1377,PART IV,"And bring it to you, with a cup of tea.”"
1378,PART IV,"And off she ran, not waiting my reply."
1379,PART IV,"But, wanting most the sunshine and the light,"
1380,PART IV,"I left my couch, and clothed myself in haste,"
1381,PART IV,"And, kneeling, sent to God an earnest cry"
1382,PART IV,For help and guidance.
1383,PART IV,"“Show Thou me the way,"
1384,PART IV,"Where duty leads, for I am blind! my sight"
1385,PART IV,"Obscured by self.  Oh, lead my steps aright!"
1386,PART IV,"Help me see the path: and if it may,"
1387,PART IV,"Let this cup pass:—and yet, Thou heavenly One,"
1388,PART IV,"Thy will in all things, not mine own, be done.”"
1389,PART IV,"Rising, I went upon my way, receiving"
1390,PART IV,The strength prayer gives alway to hearts believing.
1391,PART IV,"I felt that unseen hands were leading me,"
1392,PART IV,And knew the end was peace.
1393,PART IV,
1394,PART IV,“What! are you up?”
1395,PART IV,"Cried Helen, coming with a tray, and cup,"
1396,PART IV,"Of tender toast and fragrant, smoking tea."
1397,PART IV,“You naughty girl! you should have stayed in bed
1398,PART IV,"Until you ate your breakfast, and were better;"
1399,PART IV,I’ve something hidden for you here—a letter.
1400,PART IV,"But drink your tea before you read it, dear!"
1401,PART IV,"’Tis from some distant cousin, auntie said,"
1402,PART IV,"And so you need not hurry.  Now be good,"
1403,PART IV,And mind your Helen.”
1404,PART IV,
1405,PART IV,"So, in passive mood,"
1406,PART IV,"I laid the still unopened letter near,"
1407,PART IV,And loitered at my breakfast more to please
1408,PART IV,"My nurse, than any hunger to appease."
1409,PART IV,Then listlessly I broke the seal and read
1410,PART IV,The few lines written in a bold free hand:
1411,PART IV,"“New London, Canada.  Dear Coz. Maurine!"
1412,PART IV,(In spite of generations stretched between
1413,PART IV,Our natural right to that most handy claim
1414,PART IV,"Of cousinship, we’ll use it all the same)"
1415,PART IV,"I’m coming to see you! honestly, in truth!"
1416,PART IV,I’ve threatened often—now I mean to act;
1417,PART IV,You’ll find my coming is a stubborn fact.
1418,PART IV,"Keep quiet, though, and do not tell Aunt Ruth."
1419,PART IV,I wonder if she’ll know her petted boy
1420,PART IV,In spite of changes?  Look for me until
1421,PART IV,You see me coming.  As of old I’m still
1422,PART IV,"Your faithful friend, and loving cousin, Roy.”"
1423,PART IV,
1424,PART IV,So Roy was coming!  He and I had played
1425,PART IV,"As boy and girl, and later, youth and maid,"
1426,PART IV,"Full half our lives together.  He had been,"
1427,PART IV,"Like me, an orphan; and the roof of kin"
1428,PART IV,Gave both kind shelter.  Swift years sped away
1429,PART IV,Ere change was felt: and then one summer day
1430,PART IV,A long-lost uncle sailed from India’s shore—
1431,PART IV,"Made Roy his heir, and he was ours no more."
1432,PART IV,
1433,PART IV,"“He’d write us daily, and we’d see his face"
1434,PART IV,Once every year.”  Such was his promise given
1435,PART IV,The morn he left.  But now the years were seven
1436,PART IV,Since last he looked upon the olden place.
1437,PART IV,"He’d been through college, travelled in all lands,"
1438,PART IV,"Sailed over seas, and trod the desert sands."
1439,PART IV,"Would write and plan a visit, then, ere long,"
1440,PART IV,"Would write again from Egypt, or Hong Kong—"
1441,PART IV,Some fancy called him thither unforeseen.
1442,PART IV,"So years had passed, till seven lay between"
1443,PART IV,"His going and the coming of this note,"
1444,PART IV,"Which I hid in my bosom, and replied"
1445,PART IV,"To Aunt Ruth’s queries, “What the truant wrote?”"
1446,PART IV,"By saying he was still upon the wing,"
1447,PART IV,"And merely dropped a line, while journeying,"
1448,PART IV,To say he lived: and she was satisfied.
1449,PART IV,
1450,PART IV,"Sometimes it happens, in this world so strange,"
1451,PART IV,"A human heart will pass through mortal strife,"
1452,PART IV,"And writhe in torture: while the old sweet life,"
1453,PART IV,"So full of hope and beauty, bloom and grace,"
1454,PART IV,Is slowly strangled by remorseless Pain:
1455,PART IV,"And one stern, cold, relentless, takes its place—"
1456,PART IV,"A ghastly, pallid spectre of the slain."
1457,PART IV,Yet those in daily converse see no change
1458,PART IV,Nor dream the heart has suffered.
1459,PART IV,So that day
1460,PART IV,I passed along toward the troubled way
1461,PART IV,"Stern duty pointed, and no mortal guessed"
1462,PART IV,A mighty conflict had disturbed my breast.
1463,PART IV,
1464,PART IV,I had resolved to yield up to my friend
1465,PART IV,"The man I loved.  Since she, too, loved him so"
1466,PART IV,I saw no other way in honour left.
1467,PART IV,"She was so weak and fragile, once bereft"
1468,PART IV,"Of this great hope, that held her with such power,"
1469,PART IV,"She would wilt down, like some frost-bitten flower,"
1470,PART IV,"And swift, untimely death would be the end."
1471,PART IV,"But I was strong; and hardy plants, which grow"
1472,PART IV,"In out-door soil, can bear bleak winds that blow"
1473,PART IV,"From Arctic lands, whereof a single breath"
1474,PART IV,Would lay the hot-house blossom low in death.
1475,PART IV,
1476,PART IV,"The hours went by, too slow, and yet too fast."
1477,PART IV,All day I argued with my foolish heart
1478,PART IV,That bade me play the shrinking coward’s part
1479,PART IV,And hide from pain.  And when the day had past
1480,PART IV,"And time for Vivian’s call drew near and nearer,"
1481,PART IV,"It pleaded, “Wait until the way seems clearer;"
1482,PART IV,Say you are ill—or busy; keep away
1483,PART IV,Until you gather strength enough to play
1484,PART IV,The part you have resolved on.”
1485,PART IV,
1486,PART IV,"“Nay, not so,”"
1487,PART IV,Made answer clear-eyed Reason; “do you go
1488,PART IV,And put your resolution to the test.
1489,PART IV,"Resolve, however nobly formed, at best"
1490,PART IV,Is but a still-born babe of Thought until
1491,PART IV,It proves existence of its life and will
1492,PART IV,By sound or action.”
1493,PART IV,So when Helen came
1494,PART IV,"And knelt by me, her fair face all aflame"
1495,PART IV,"With sudden blushes, whispering, “My sweet!"
1496,PART IV,"My heart can hear the music of his feet,"
1497,PART IV,"Go down with me to meet him,” I arose,"
1498,PART IV,"And went with her all calmly, as one goes"
1499,PART IV,To look upon the dear face of the dead.
1500,PART IV,
1501,PART IV,That eve I know not what I did or said.
1502,PART IV,I was not cold—my manner was not strange;
1503,PART IV,"Perchance I talked more freely than my wont,"
1504,PART IV,But in my speech was naught could give affront;
1505,PART IV,"Yet I conveyed, as only woman can,"
1506,PART IV,That nameless _something_ which bespeaks a change.
1507,PART IV,
1508,PART IV,"’Tis in the power of woman, if she be"
1509,PART IV,"Whole-souled and noble, free from coquetry—"
1510,PART IV,"Her motives all unselfish, worthy, good,"
1511,PART IV,To make herself and feelings understood
1512,PART IV,"By nameless acts, thus sparing what to man,"
1513,PART IV,"However gently answered, causes pain,"
1514,PART IV,The offering of his hand and heart in vain.
1515,PART IV,
1516,PART IV,"She can be friendly, unrestrained, and kind"
1517,PART IV,Assume no airs of pride or arrogance;
1518,PART IV,"But in her voice, her manner, and her glance,"
1519,PART IV,"Convey that mystic something, undefined,"
1520,PART IV,"Which men fail not to understand and read,"
1521,PART IV,"And, when not blind with egoism, heed."
1522,PART IV,My task was harder—’twas the slow undoing
1523,PART IV,Of long sweet months of unimpeded wooing.
1524,PART IV,It was to hide and cover and conceal
1525,PART IV,"The truth, assuming what I did not feel."
1526,PART IV,It was to dam love’s happy singing tide
1527,PART IV,"That blessed me with its hopeful, tuneful tone"
1528,PART IV,"By feigned indiff’rence, till it turned aside"
1529,PART IV,"And changed its channel, leaving me alone"
1530,PART IV,"To walk parched plains, and thirst for that sweet draught"
1531,PART IV,"My lips had tasted, but another quaffed."
1532,PART IV,"It could be done, for no words yet were spoken—"
1533,PART IV,None to recall—no pledges to be broken.
1534,PART IV,"“He will be grieved, then angry, cold, then cross,”"
1535,PART IV,"I reasoned, thinking what would be his part"
1536,PART IV,"In this strange drama.  “Then, because he"
1537,PART IV,"Feels something lacking, to make good his loss"
1538,PART IV,"He’ll turn to Helen, and her gentle grace"
1539,PART IV,And loving acts will win her soon the place
1540,PART IV,I hold to-day; and like a troubled dream
1541,PART IV,"At length, our past, when he looks back, will seem.”"
1542,PART IV,
1543,PART IV,"That evening passed with music, chat, and song,"
1544,PART IV,But hours that once had flown on airy wings
1545,PART IV,"Now limped on weary, aching limbs along,"
1546,PART IV,Each moment like some dreaded step that brings
1547,PART IV,A twinge of pain.
1548,PART IV,"As Vivian rose to go,"
1549,PART IV,"Slow bending to me from his greater height,"
1550,PART IV,"He took my hand, and, looking in my eyes,"
1551,PART IV,"With tender questioning and pained surprise,"
1552,PART IV,"Said, “Maurine, you are not yourself to-night;"
1553,PART IV,What is it?  Are you ailing?”
1554,PART IV,"“Ailing?  No,”"
1555,PART IV,"I answered, laughing lightly, “I am not;"
1556,PART IV,"Just see my cheek, sir—is it thin, or pale?"
1557,PART IV,"Now, tell me, am I looking very frail?”"
1558,PART IV,"“Nay, nay,” he answered, “it cannot be _seen_,"
1559,PART IV,The change I speak of—’twas more in your mien—
1560,PART IV,"Preoccupation, or—I know not what!"
1561,PART IV,"Miss Helen, am I wrong, or does Maurine"
1562,PART IV,Seem to have something on her mind this eve?”
1563,PART IV,"“She does,” laughed Helen, “and I do believe"
1564,PART IV,I know what ’tis!  A letter came to-day
1565,PART IV,"Which she read slyly, and then hid away"
1566,PART IV,"Close to her heart, not knowing I was near,"
1567,PART IV,And since she’s been as you have seen her here.
1568,PART IV,See how she blushes! so my random shot
1569,PART IV,We must believe has struck a tender spot.”
1570,PART IV,
1571,PART IV,"Her rippling laughter floated through the room,"
1572,PART IV,"And redder yet I felt the hot blood rise,"
1573,PART IV,"Then surge away, to leave me pale as death"
1574,PART IV,Under the dark and swiftly gathering gloom
1575,PART IV,"Of Vivian’s questioning, accusing eyes,"
1576,PART IV,That searched my soul.  I almost shrieked beneath
1577,PART IV,"That stern, fixed gaze, and stood spellbound until"
1578,PART IV,"He turned with sudden movement, gave his hand"
1579,PART IV,"To each in turn, and said: “You must not stand"
1580,PART IV,"Longer, young ladies, in this open door."
1581,PART IV,"The air is heavy with a cold, damp chill."
1582,PART IV,"We shall have rain to-morrow, or before."
1583,PART IV,Good-night.”
1584,PART IV,
1585,PART IV,He vanished in the darkling shade;
1586,PART IV,"And so the dreaded evening found an end,"
1587,PART IV,"That saw me grasp the conscience-whetted blade,"
1588,PART IV,And strike a blow for honour and for friend.
1589,PART IV,
1590,PART IV,“How swiftly passed the evening!” Helen sighed.
1591,PART IV,“How long the hours!” my tortured heart replied.
1592,PART IV,"Joy, like a child, with lightsome steps doth glide"
1593,PART IV,"By Father Time, and, looking in his face,"
1594,PART IV,"Cries, snatching blossoms from the fair roadside,"
1595,PART IV,"“I could pluck more, but for thy hurried pace.”"
1596,PART IV,"The while her elder brother Pain, man grown,"
1597,PART IV,"Whose feet are hurt by many a thorn and stone,"
1598,PART IV,"Looks to some distant hilltop, high and calm,"
1599,PART IV,"Where he shall find not only rest, but balm"
1600,PART IV,"For all his wounds, and cries, in tones of woe,"
1601,PART IV,"“Oh, Father Time! why is thy pace so slow?”"
1602,PART IV,
1603,PART IV,"Two days, all sad with lonely wind and rain,"
1604,PART IV,"Went sobbing by, repeating o’er and o’er"
1605,PART IV,"The miserere, desolate and drear,"
1606,PART IV,Which every human heart must sometime hear.
1607,PART IV,"Pain is but little varied.  Its refrain,"
1608,PART IV,"Whate’er the words are, is for aye the same."
1609,PART IV,"The third day brought a change, for with it came"
1610,PART IV,"Not only sunny smiles to Nature’s face,"
1611,PART IV,"But Roy, our Roy came back to us.  Once more"
1612,PART IV,"We looked into his laughing, handsome eyes,"
1613,PART IV,"Which, while they gave Aunt Ruth a glad surprise"
1614,PART IV,"In no way puzzled her, for one glance told"
1615,PART IV,"What each succeeding one confirmed, that he"
1616,PART IV,Who bent above her with the lissome grace
1617,PART IV,"Of his fine form, though grown so tall, could be"
1618,PART IV,No other than the Roy Montaine of old.
1619,PART IV,
1620,PART IV,"It was a sweet reunion, and he brought"
1621,PART IV,"So much of sunshine with him that I caught,"
1622,PART IV,"Just from his smile alone, enough of gladness"
1623,PART IV,To make my heart forget a time its sadness.
1624,PART IV,We talked together of the dear old days:
1625,PART IV,"Leaving the present, with its depths and heights"
1626,PART IV,"Of life’s maturer sorrows and delights,"
1627,PART IV,"I turned back to my childhood’s level land,"
1628,PART IV,"And Roy and I, dear playmates, hand in hand,"
1629,PART IV,Wandered in mem’ry through the olden ways.
1630,PART IV,
1631,PART IV,It was the second evening of his coming.
1632,PART IV,"Helen was playing dreamily, and humming"
1633,PART IV,"Some wordless melody of white-souled thought,"
1634,PART IV,"While Roy and I sat by the open door,"
1635,PART IV,Re-living childish incidents of yore.
1636,PART IV,"My eyes were glowing, and my cheeks were hot"
1637,PART IV,"With warm young blood; excitement, joy, or pain"
1638,PART IV,Alike would send swift coursing through each vein.
1639,PART IV,"Roy, always eloquent, was waxing fine,"
1640,PART IV,And bringing vividly before my gaze
1641,PART IV,"Some old adventure of those halcyon days,"
1642,PART IV,"When suddenly, in pauses of the talk,"
1643,PART IV,"I heard a well-known step upon the walk,"
1644,PART IV,And looked up quickly to meet full in mine
1645,PART IV,The eyes of Vivian Dangerfield.  A flash
1646,PART IV,Shot from their depths:—a sudden blaze of light
1647,PART IV,"Like that swift followed by the thunder’s crash,"
1648,PART IV,"Which said, “Suspicion is confirmed by sight,”"
1649,PART IV,As they fell on the pleasant doorway scene.
1650,PART IV,"Then o’er his clear-cut face a cold, white look"
1651,PART IV,"Crept, like the pallid moonlight o’er a brook,"
1652,PART IV,"And, with a slight, proud bending of the head,"
1653,PART IV,"He stepped toward us haughtily, and said:"
1654,PART IV,"“Please pardon my intrusion, Miss Maurine,"
1655,PART IV,I called to ask Miss Trevor for a book
1656,PART IV,"She spoke of lending me; nay, sit you still,"
1657,PART IV,"And I, by grant of your permission, will"
1658,PART IV,Pass by to where I hear her playing.”
1659,PART IV,"“Stay,”"
1660,PART IV,"I said, “one moment, Vivian, if you please;”"
1661,PART IV,"And suddenly bereft of all my ease,"
1662,PART IV,"And scarcely knowing what to do or say,"
1663,PART IV,"Confused as any schoolgirl, I arose,"
1664,PART IV,And some way made each to the other known.
1665,PART IV,"They bowed, shook hands, then Vivian turned away"
1666,PART IV,"And sought out Helen, leaving us alone."
1667,PART IV,
1668,PART IV,“One of Miss Trevor’s or of Maurine’s beaux?
1669,PART IV,"Which may he be, who cometh like a prince"
1670,PART IV,With haughty bearing and an eagle eye?”
1671,PART IV,"Roy queried, laughing; and I answered, “Since"
1672,PART IV,"You saw him pass me for Miss Trevor’s side,"
1673,PART IV,I leave your own good judgment to reply.”
1674,PART IV,
1675,PART IV,And straightway caused the tide of talk to glide
1676,PART IV,"In other channels, striving to dispel"
1677,PART IV,The sudden gloom that o’er my spirit fell.
1678,PART IV,
1679,PART IV,We mortals are such hypocrites at best!
1680,PART IV,"When Conscience tries our courage with a test,"
1681,PART IV,"And points to some steep pathway, we set out"
1682,PART IV,"Boldly, denying any fear or doubt;"
1683,PART IV,"But pause before the first rock in the way,"
1684,PART IV,"And, looking back, with tears, at Conscience, say:"
1685,PART IV,"“We are so sad, dear Conscience! for we would"
1686,PART IV,Most gladly do what to thee seemeth good;
1687,PART IV,"But lo! this rock! we cannot climb it, so"
1688,PART IV,Thou must point out some other way to go.”
1689,PART IV,"Yet secretly we are rejoicing: and,"
1690,PART IV,"When right before our faces, as we stand"
1691,PART IV,"In seeming grief, the rock is cleft in twain,"
1692,PART IV,"Leaving the pathway clear, we shrink in pain,"
1693,PART IV,"And, loth to go, by every act reveal"
1694,PART IV,What we so tried from Conscience to conceal.
1695,PART IV,
1696,PART IV,"I saw that hour, the way made plain, to do"
1697,PART IV,With scarce an effort what had seemed a strife
1698,PART IV,That would require the strength of my whole life.
1699,PART IV,
1700,PART IV,"Women have quick perceptions, and I knew"
1701,PART IV,"That Vivian’s heart was full of jealous pain,"
1702,PART IV,"Suspecting—nay, _believing_—Roy Montaine"
1703,PART IV,To be my lover.  First my altered mien—
1704,PART IV,And next the letter—then the doorway scene—
1705,PART IV,My flushed face gazing in the one above
1706,PART IV,"That bent so near me, and my strange confusion"
1707,PART IV,When Vivian came all led to one conclusion:
1708,PART IV,"That I had but been playing with his love,"
1709,PART IV,As women sometimes cruelly do play
1710,PART IV,With hearts when their true lovers are away.
1711,PART IV,
1712,PART IV,There could be nothing easier than just
1713,PART IV,To let him linger on in this belief
1714,PART IV,Till hourly-fed Suspicion and Distrust
1715,PART IV,Should turn to scorn and anger all his grief.
1716,PART IV,"Compared with me, so doubly sweet and pure"
1717,PART IV,"Would Helen seem, my purpose would be sure"
1718,PART IV,And certain of completion in the end.
1719,PART IV,"But now, the way was made so straight and clear,"
1720,PART IV,"My coward heart shrank back in guilty fear,"
1721,PART IV,"Till Conscience whispered with her “still small voice,”"
1722,PART IV,“The precious time is passing—make thy choice—
1723,PART IV,"Resign thy love, or slay thy trusting friend.”"
1724,PART IV,
1725,PART IV,"The growing moon, watched by the myriad eyes"
1726,PART IV,"Of countless stars, went sailing through the skies,"
1727,PART IV,"Like some young prince, rising to rule a nation,"
1728,PART IV,To whom all eyes are turned in expectation.
1729,PART IV,A woman who possesses tact and art
1730,PART IV,"And strength of will can take the hand of doom,"
1731,PART IV,"And walk on, smiling sweetly as she goes,"
1732,PART IV,"With rosy lips, and rounded cheeks of bloom,"
1733,PART IV,Cheating a loud-tongued world that never knows
1734,PART IV,The pain and sorrow of her hidden heart.
1735,PART IV,And so I joined in Roy’s bright changing chat;
1736,PART IV,"Answered his sallies—talked of this and that,"
1737,PART IV,"My brow unruffled as the calm, still wave"
1738,PART IV,"That tells not of the wrecked ship, and the grave"
1739,PART IV,Beneath its surface.
1740,PART IV,"Then we heard, ere long,"
1741,PART IV,"The sound of Helen’s gentle voice in song,"
1742,PART IV,"And, rising, entered where the subtle power"
1743,PART IV,"Of Vivian’s eyes, forgiving while accusing,"
1744,PART IV,"Finding me weak, had won me, in that hour;"
1745,PART IV,"But Roy, always polite and debonair"
1746,PART IV,"Where ladies were, now hung about my chair"
1747,PART IV,"With nameless delicate attentions, using"
1748,PART IV,"That air devotional, and those small arts"
1749,PART IV,Acquaintance with society imparts
1750,PART IV,To men gallant by nature.
1751,PART IV,’Twas my sex
1752,PART IV,And not myself he bowed to.  Had my place
1753,PART IV,Been filled that evening by a dowager
1754,PART IV,"Twice his own age, he would have given her"
1755,PART IV,The same attentions.  But they served to vex
1756,PART IV,Whatever hope in Vivian’s heart remained.
1757,PART IV,"The cold, white look crept back upon his face,"
1758,PART IV,Which told how deeply he was hurt and pained.
1759,PART IV,
1760,PART IV,Little by little all things had conspired
1761,PART IV,"To bring events I dreaded, yet desired."
1762,PART IV,"We were in constant intercourse: walks, rides,"
1763,PART IV,"Picnics and sails, filled weeks of golden weather,"
1764,PART IV,And almost hourly we were thrown together.
1765,PART IV,No words were spoken of rebuke or scorn:
1766,PART IV,Good friends we seemed.  But as a gulf divides
1767,PART IV,"This land and that, though lying side by side,"
1768,PART IV,So rolled a gulf between us—deep and wide—
1769,PART IV,"The gulf of doubt, which widened slowly morn"
1770,PART IV,And noon and night.
1771,PART IV,
1772,PART IV,Free and informal were
1773,PART IV,"These picnics and excursions.  Yet, although"
1774,PART IV,Helen and I would sometimes choose to go
1775,PART IV,"Without our escorts, leaving them quite free,"
1776,PART IV,It happened alway Roy would seek out me
1777,PART IV,"Ere passed the day, while Vivian walked with her."
1778,PART IV,I had no thought of flirting.  Roy was just
1779,PART IV,"Like some dear brother, and I quite forgot"
1780,PART IV,The kinship was so distant it was not
1781,PART IV,"Safe to rely upon in perfect trust,"
1782,PART IV,"Without reserve or caution.  Many a time,"
1783,PART IV,When there was some steep mountain-side to climb
1784,PART IV,"And I grew weary, he would say, “Maurine,"
1785,PART IV,Come rest you here.”  And I would go and lean
1786,PART IV,"My head upon his shoulder, or would stand"
1787,PART IV,"And let him hold in his my willing hand,"
1788,PART IV,The while he stroked it gently with his own.
1789,PART IV,"Or I would let him clasp me with his arm,"
1790,PART IV,"Nor entertained a thought of any harm,"
1791,PART IV,Nor once supposed but Vivian was alone
1792,PART IV,In his suspicions.  But ere long the truth
1793,PART IV,I learned in consternation! both Aunt Ruth
1794,PART IV,"And Helen honestly, in faith, believed"
1795,PART IV,That Roy and I were lovers.
1796,PART IV,
1797,PART IV,"Undeceived,"
1798,PART IV,Some careless words might open Vivian’s eyes
1799,PART IV,"And spoil my plans.  So reasoning in this wise,"
1800,PART IV,"To all their sallies I in jest replied,"
1801,PART IV,"To naught assented, and yet naught denied,"
1802,PART IV,"With Roy unchanged remaining, confident"
1803,PART IV,Each understood just what the other meant.
1804,PART IV,
1805,PART IV,"If I grew weary of this double part,"
1806,PART IV,And self-imposed deception caused my heart
1807,PART IV,"Sometimes to shrink, I needed but to gaze"
1808,PART IV,"On Helen’s face: that wore a look ethereal,"
1809,PART IV,As if she dwelt above the things material
1810,PART IV,And held communion with the angels.  So
1811,PART IV,I fed my strength and courage through the days.
1812,PART IV,What time the harvest moon rose full and clear
1813,PART IV,"And cast its ling’ring radiance on the earth,"
1814,PART IV,"We made a feast; and called from far and near,"
1815,PART IV,"Our friends, who came to share the scene of mirth."
1816,PART IV,Fair forms and faces flitted to and fro;
1817,PART IV,"But none more sweet than Helen’s.  Robed in white,"
1818,PART IV,She floated like a vision through the dance.
1819,PART IV,"So frailly fragile and so phantom fair,"
1820,PART IV,"She seemed like some stray spirit of the air,"
1821,PART IV,And was pursued by many an anxious glance
1822,PART IV,That looked to see her fading from the sight
1823,PART IV,Like figures that a dreamer sees at night.
1824,PART IV,And noble men and gallants graced the scene:
1825,PART IV,Yet none more noble or more grand of mien
1826,PART IV,"Than Vivian—broad of chest and shoulder, tall"
1827,PART IV,"And finely formed, as any Grecian god"
1828,PART IV,Whose high-arched foot on Mount Olympus trod.
1829,PART IV,"His clear-cut face was beardless; and, like those"
1830,PART IV,"Same Grecian statues, when in calm repose,"
1831,PART IV,Was it in hue and feature.  Framed in hair
1832,PART IV,Dark and abundant; lighted by large eyes
1833,PART IV,"That could be cold as steel in winter air,"
1834,PART IV,Or warm and sunny as Italian skies.
1835,PART IV,
1836,PART IV,"Weary of mirth and music, and the sound"
1837,PART IV,"Of tripping feet, I sought a moment’s rest"
1838,PART IV,"Within the lib’ry, where a group I found"
1839,PART IV,"Of guests, discussing with apparent zest"
1840,PART IV,"Some theme of interest—Vivian, near the while,"
1841,PART IV,"Leaning and listening with his slow, odd smile."
1842,PART IV,"“Now, Miss La Pelle, we will appeal to you,”"
1843,PART IV,"Cried young Guy Semple, as I entered.  “We"
1844,PART IV,"Have been discussing right before his face,"
1845,PART IV,"All unrebuked by him, as you may see,"
1846,PART IV,A poem lately published by our friend:
1847,PART IV,And we are quite divided.  I contend
1848,PART IV,The poem is a libel and untrue.
1849,PART IV,"I hold the fickle women are but few,"
1850,PART IV,Compared with those who are like yon fair moon
1851,PART IV,"That, ever faithful, rises in her place"
1852,PART IV,Whether she’s greeted by the flowers of June
1853,PART IV,Or cold and dreary stretches of white space.”
1854,PART IV,
1855,PART IV,"“Oh!” cried another, “Mr. Dangerfield,"
1856,PART IV,Look to your laurels! or you needs must yield
1857,PART IV,"The crown to Semple, who, ’tis very plain,"
1858,PART IV,Has mounted Pegasus and grasped his mane.”
1859,PART IV,
1860,PART IV,"All laughed: and then, as Guy appealed to me,"
1861,PART IV,"I answered lightly, “My young friend, I fear"
1862,PART IV,You chose a most unlucky simile
1863,PART IV,To prove the truth of woman.  To her place
1864,PART IV,The moon does rise—but with a different face
1865,PART IV,Each time she comes.  But now I needs must hear
1866,PART IV,"The poem read, before I can consent"
1867,PART IV,To pass my judgment on the sentiment.”
1868,PART IV,All clamoured that the author was the man
1869,PART IV,"To read the poem: and, with tones that said"
1870,PART IV,"More than the cutting, scornful words he read,"
1871,PART IV,"Taking the book Guy gave him, he began:"

1874,HER LOVE.,HER LOVE.
1875,HER LOVE.,
1876,HER LOVE.,
1877,HER LOVE.,The sands upon the ocean side
1878,HER LOVE.,"That change about with every tide,"
1879,HER LOVE.,"And never true to one abide,"
1880,HER LOVE.,A woman’s love I liken to.
1881,HER LOVE.,
1882,HER LOVE.,"The summer zephyrs, light and vain,"
1883,HER LOVE.,That sing the same alluring strain
1884,HER LOVE.,To every grass blade on the plain—
1885,HER LOVE.,A woman’s love is nothing more.
1886,HER LOVE.,
1887,HER LOVE.,The sunshine of an April day
1888,HER LOVE.,"That comes to warm you with its ray,"
1889,HER LOVE.,But while you smile has flown away—
1890,HER LOVE.,A woman’s love is like to this.
1891,HER LOVE.,
1892,HER LOVE.,"God made poor woman with no heart,"
1893,HER LOVE.,"But gave her skill, and tact, and art,"
1894,HER LOVE.,"And so she lives, and plays her part."
1895,HER LOVE.,"We must not blame, but pity her."
1896,HER LOVE.,
1897,HER LOVE.,She leans to man—but just to hear
1898,HER LOVE.,"The praise he whispers in her ear,"
1899,HER LOVE.,"Herself, not him, she holdeth dear—"
1900,HER LOVE.,"Oh, fool! to be deceived by her."
1901,HER LOVE.,
1902,HER LOVE.,To sate her selfish thirst she quaffs
1903,HER LOVE.,"The love of strong hearts in sweet draughts,"
1904,HER LOVE.,"Then throws them lightly by and laughs,"
1905,HER LOVE.,Too weak to understand their pain.
1906,HER LOVE.,
1907,HER LOVE.,As changeful as the winds that blow
1908,HER LOVE.,"From every region, to and fro,"
1909,HER LOVE.,"Devoid of heart, she cannot know"
1910,HER LOVE.,The suffering of a human heart.
1911,HER LOVE.,
1912,HER LOVE.,"I knew the cold, fixed gaze of Vivian’s eyes"
1913,HER LOVE.,Saw the slow colour to my forehead rise;
1914,HER LOVE.,"But lightly answered, toying with my fan,"
1915,HER LOVE.,“That sentiment is very like a man!
1916,HER LOVE.,"Men call us fickle, but they do us wrong;"
1917,HER LOVE.,"We’re only frail and helpless, men are strong;"
1918,HER LOVE.,"And when love dies, they take the poor dead thing"
1919,HER LOVE.,"And make a shroud out of their suffering,"
1920,HER LOVE.,And drag the corpse about with them for years.
1921,HER LOVE.,But we?—we mourn it for a day with tears!
1922,HER LOVE.,"And then we robe it for its last long rest,"
1923,HER LOVE.,"And being women, feeble things at best,"
1924,HER LOVE.,We cannot dig the grave ourselves.  And so
1925,HER LOVE.,We call strong-limbed New Love to lay it low:
1926,HER LOVE.,Immortal sexton he! whom Venus sends
1927,HER LOVE.,"To do this service for her earthly friends,"
1928,HER LOVE.,The trusty fellow digs the grave so deep
1929,HER LOVE.,Nothing disturbs the dead laid there to sleep.”
1930,HER LOVE.,
1931,HER LOVE.,The laugh that followed had not died away
1932,HER LOVE.,Ere Roy Montaine came seeking me to say
1933,HER LOVE.,"The band was tuning for our waltz, and so"
1934,HER LOVE.,Back to the ball-room bore me.  In the glow
1935,HER LOVE.,"And heat and whirl, my strength ere long was spent,"
1936,HER LOVE.,"And I grew faint and dizzy, and we went"
1937,HER LOVE.,"Out on the cool moonlighted portico,"
1938,HER LOVE.,"And, sitting there, Roy drew my languid head"
1939,HER LOVE.,"Upon the shelter of his breast, and bent"
1940,HER LOVE.,"His smiling eyes upon me, as he said:"
1941,HER LOVE.,“I’ll try the mesmerism of my touch
1942,HER LOVE.,"To work a cure: be very quiet now,"
1943,HER LOVE.,And let me make some passes o’er your brow.
1944,HER LOVE.,"Why, how it throbs! you’ve exercised too much!"
1945,HER LOVE.,I shall not let you dance again to-night.”
1946,HER LOVE.,
1947,HER LOVE.,"Just then before us, in the broad moonlight,"
1948,HER LOVE.,Two forms were mirrored: and I turned my face
1949,HER LOVE.,To catch the teasing and mischievous glance
1950,HER LOVE.,"Of Helen’s eyes, as, heated by the dance,"
1951,HER LOVE.,"Leaning on Vivian’s arm, she sought this place."
1952,HER LOVE.,
1953,HER LOVE.,"“I beg your pardon,” came in that round tone"
1954,HER LOVE.,Of his low voice.  “I think we do intrude.”
1955,HER LOVE.,"Bowing, they turned, and left us quite alone"
1956,HER LOVE.,Ere I could speak or change my attitude.
1957,HER LOVE.,
1958,HER LOVE.,

1961,PART V,
1962,PART V,
1963,PART V,A visit to a cave some miles away
1964,PART V,"Was next in order.  So, one sunny day,"
1965,PART V,Four prancing steeds conveyed a laughing load
1966,PART V,Of merry pleasure-seekers o’er the road.
1967,PART V,"A basket picnic, music, and croquet"
1968,PART V,"Were in the programme.  Skies were blue and clear,"
1969,PART V,And cool winds whispered of the Autumn near.
1970,PART V,The merry-makers filled the time with pleasure:
1971,PART V,"Some floated to the music’s rhythmic measure,"
1972,PART V,"Some played, some promenaded on the green."
1973,PART V,"Ticked off by happy hearts, the moments passed."
1974,PART V,"The afternoon, all glow and glimmer, came."
1975,PART V,"Helen and Roy were leaders of some game,"
1976,PART V,And Vivian was not visible.
1977,PART V,
1978,PART V,"“Maurine,"
1979,PART V,I challenge you to climb yon cliff with me!
1980,PART V,"And who shall tire, or reach the summit last"
1981,PART V,"Must pay a forfeit,” cried a romping maid."
1982,PART V,"“Come! start at once, or own you are afraid.”"
1983,PART V,"So challenged I made ready for the race,"
1984,PART V,Deciding first the forfeit was to be
1985,PART V,A handsome pair of bootees to replace
1986,PART V,The victor’s loss who made the rough ascent.
1987,PART V,The cliff was steep and stony.  On we went
1988,PART V,"As eagerly as if the path was Fame,"
1989,PART V,"And what we climbed for, glory and a name."
1990,PART V,"My hands were bruised; my garments sadly rent,"
1991,PART V,"But on I clambered.  Soon I heard a cry,"
1992,PART V,“Maurine!  Maurine! my strength is wholly spent!
1993,PART V,You’ve won the boots!  I’m going back—good-bye!”
1994,PART V,"And back she turned, in spite of laugh and jeer."
1995,PART V,
1996,PART V,"I reached the summit: and its solitude,"
1997,PART V,"Wherein no living creature did intrude,"
1998,PART V,"Save some sad birds that wheeled and circled near,"
1999,PART V,I found far sweeter than the scene below.
2000,PART V,"Alone with One who knew my hidden woe,"
2001,PART V,I did not feel so much alone as when
2002,PART V,I mixed with th’ unthinking throngs of men.
2003,PART V,
2004,PART V,"Some flowers that decked the barren, sterile place"
2005,PART V,"I plucked, and read the lesson they conveyed,"
2006,PART V,"That in our lives, albeit dark with shade"
2007,PART V,"And rough and hard with labour, yet may grow"
2008,PART V,"The flowers of Patience, Sympathy, and Grace."
2009,PART V,
2010,PART V,"As I walked on in meditative thought,"
2011,PART V,A serpent writhed across my pathway; not
2012,PART V,A large or deadly serpent; yet the sight
2013,PART V,Filled me with ghastly terror and affright.
2014,PART V,I shrieked aloud: a darkness veiled my eyes—
2015,PART V,And I fell fainting ’neath the watchful skies.
2016,PART V,
2017,PART V,"I was no coward.  Country-bred and born,"
2018,PART V,I had no feeling but the keenest scorn
2019,PART V,For those fine lady “ah’s” and “oh’s” of fear
2020,PART V,So much assumed (when any man is near).
2021,PART V,But God implanted in each human heart
2022,PART V,"A natural horror, and a sickly dread"
2023,PART V,"Of that accursèd, slimy, creeping thing"
2024,PART V,That squirms a limbless carcass o’er the ground.
2025,PART V,And where that inborn loathing is not found
2026,PART V,You’ll find the serpent qualities instead.
2027,PART V,"Who fears it not, himself is next of kin,"
2028,PART V,And in his bosom holds some treacherous art
2029,PART V,Whereby to counteract its venomed sting.
2030,PART V,And all are sired by Satan—Chief of Sin.
2031,PART V,
2032,PART V,"Who loathes not that foul creature of the dust,"
2033,PART V,"However fair in seeming, I distrust."
2034,PART V,
2035,PART V,"I woke from my unconsciousness, to know"
2036,PART V,"I leaned upon a broad and manly breast,"
2037,PART V,"And Vivian’s voice was speaking, soft and low,"
2038,PART V,"Sweet whispered words of passion, o’er and o’er."
2039,PART V,I dared not breathe.  Had I found Eden’s shore?
2040,PART V,Was this a foretaste of eternal bliss?
2041,PART V,"“My love,” he sighed, his voice like winds that moan"
2042,PART V,"Before a rain in Summer-time, “my own,"
2043,PART V,"For one sweet stolen moment, lie and rest"
2044,PART V,Upon this heart that loves and hates you both!
2045,PART V,O fair false face!  Why were you made so fair!
2046,PART V,O mouth of Southern sweetness! that ripe kiss
2047,PART V,"That hangs upon you, I do take an oath"
2048,PART V,_His_ lips shall never gather.  There!—and there!
2049,PART V,I steal it from him.  Are you his—all his?
2050,PART V,"Nay, you are mine, this moment, as I dreamed—"
2051,PART V,Blind fool—believing you were what you seemed—
2052,PART V,You would be mine in all the years to come.
2053,PART V,Fair fiend!  I love and hate you in a breath.
2054,PART V,"O God! if this white pallor were but _death_,"
2055,PART V,"And I were stretched beside you, cold and dumb,"
2056,PART V,"My arms about you, so—in fond embrace!"
2057,PART V,"My lips pressed, so—upon your dying face!”"
2058,PART V,
2059,PART V,"“Woman, how dare you bring me to such shame!"
2060,PART V,"How dare you drive me to an act like this,"
2061,PART V,To steal from your unconscious lips the kiss
2062,PART V,You lured me on to think my rightful claim!
2063,PART V,O frail and puny woman! could you know
2064,PART V,The devil that you waken in the hearts
2065,PART V,"You snare and bind in your enticing arts,"
2066,PART V,"The thin, pale stuff that in your veins doth flow"
2067,PART V,Would freeze in terror.
2068,PART V,
2069,PART V,Strange you have such power
2070,PART V,"To please or pain us, poor, weak, soulless things—"
2071,PART V,Devoid of passion as a senseless flower!
2072,PART V,"Like butterflies, your only boast, your wings."
2073,PART V,"There, now I scorn you—scorn you from this hour,"
2074,PART V,And hate myself for having talked of love!”
2075,PART V,
2076,PART V,He pushed me from him.  And I felt as those
2077,PART V,"Doomed angels must, when pearly gates above"
2078,PART V,Are closed against them.
2079,PART V,
2080,PART V,With a feigned surprise
2081,PART V,"I started up and opened wide my eyes,"
2082,PART V,And looked about.  Then in confusion rose
2083,PART V,And stood before him.
2084,PART V,
2085,PART V,"“Pardon me, I pray!”"
2086,PART V,He said quite coldly.  “Half an hour ago
2087,PART V,"I left you with the company below,"
2088,PART V,"And sought this cliff.  A moment since you cried,"
2089,PART V,"It seemed, in sudden terror and alarm."
2090,PART V,I came in time to see you swoon away.
2091,PART V,You’ll need assistance down the rugged side
2092,PART V,Of this steep cliff.  I pray you take my arm.”
2093,PART V,
2094,PART V,"So, formal and constrained, we passed along,"
2095,PART V,"Rejoined our friends, and mingled with the throng"
2096,PART V,To have no further speech again that day.
2097,PART V,
2098,PART V,"Next morn there came a bulky document,"
2099,PART V,"The legal firm of Blank and Blank had sent,"
2100,PART V,Containing news unlooked for.  An estate
2101,PART V,Which proved a cosy fortune—nowise great
2102,PART V,"Or princely—had in France been left to me,"
2103,PART V,My grandsire’s last descendant.  And it brought
2104,PART V,A sense of joy and freedom in the thought
2105,PART V,"Of foreign travel, which I hoped would be"
2106,PART V,"A panacea for my troubled mind,"
2107,PART V,That longed to leave the olden scenes behind
2108,PART V,"With all their recollections, and to flee"
2109,PART V,To some strange country.
2110,PART V,
2111,PART V,I was in such haste
2112,PART V,To put between me and my native land
2113,PART V,"The briny ocean’s desolating waste,"
2114,PART V,"I gave Aunt Ruth no peace, until she planned"
2115,PART V,"To sail that week, two months: though she was fain"
2116,PART V,To wait until the Springtime.  Roy Montaine
2117,PART V,Would be our guide and escort.
2118,PART V,
2119,PART V,No one dreamed
2120,PART V,"The cause of my strange hurry, but all seemed"
2121,PART V,To think good fortune had quite turned my brain.
2122,PART V,"One bright October morning, when the woods"
2123,PART V,Had donned their purple mantles and red hoods
2124,PART V,"In honour of the Frost King, Vivian came,"
2125,PART V,"Bringing some green leaves, tipped with crimson flame,—"
2126,PART V,First trophies of the Autumn time.
2127,PART V,
2128,PART V,And Roy
2129,PART V,Made a proposal that we all should go
2130,PART V,And ramble in the forest for a while.
2131,PART V,But Helen said she was not well—and so
2132,PART V,"Must stay at home.  Then Vivian, with a smile,"
2133,PART V,"Responded, “I will stay and talk to you,"
2134,PART V,And they may go;” at which her two cheeks grew
2135,PART V,"Like twin blush roses—dyed with love’s red wave,"
2136,PART V,Her fair face shone transfigured with great joy.
2137,PART V,
2138,PART V,And Vivian saw—and suddenly was grave.
2139,PART V,Roy took my arm in that protecting way
2140,PART V,"Peculiar to some men, which seems to say,"
2141,PART V,"“I shield my own,” a manner pleasing, e’en"
2142,PART V,When we are conscious that it does not mean
2143,PART V,More than a simple courtesy.  A woman
2144,PART V,"Whose heart is wholly feminine and human,"
2145,PART V,"And not unsexed by hobbies, likes to be"
2146,PART V,"The object of that tender chivalry,"
2147,PART V,"That guardianship which man bestows on her,"
2148,PART V,Yet mixed with deference; as if she were
2149,PART V,"Half child, half angel."
2150,PART V,
2151,PART V,"Though she may be strong,"
2152,PART V,"Noble and self-reliant, not afraid"
2153,PART V,To raise her hand and voice against all wrong
2154,PART V,"And all oppression, yet if she be made,"
2155,PART V,"With all the independence of her thought,"
2156,PART V,"A woman womanly, as God designed,"
2157,PART V,Albeit she may have as great a mind
2158,PART V,"As man, her brother, yet his strength of arm,"
2159,PART V,"His muscle and his boldness she has not,"
2160,PART V,And cannot have without she loses what
2161,PART V,"Is far more precious, modesty and grace."
2162,PART V,"So, walking on in her appointed place,"
2163,PART V,"She does not strive to ape him, nor pretend"
2164,PART V,"But that she needs him for a guide and friend,"
2165,PART V,To shield her with his greater strength from harm.
2166,PART V,We reached the forest; wandered to and fro
2167,PART V,"Through many a winding path and dim retreat,"
2168,PART V,Till I grew weary: when I chose a seat
2169,PART V,"Upon an oak-tree, which had been laid low"
2170,PART V,"By some wind storm, or by some lightning stroke."
2171,PART V,"And Roy stood just below me, where the ledge"
2172,PART V,On which I sat sloped steeply to the edge
2173,PART V,Of sunny meadows lying at my feet.
2174,PART V,One hand held mine; the other grasped a limb
2175,PART V,That cast its checkered shadows over him;
2176,PART V,"And, with his head thrown back, his dark eyes raised"
2177,PART V,"And fixed upon me, silently he gazed"
2178,PART V,"Until I, smiling, turned to him and spoke:"
2179,PART V,"“Give words, my cousin, to those thoughts that rise,"
2180,PART V,"And, like dumb spirits, look forth from your eyes.”"
2181,PART V,
2182,PART V,The smooth and even darkness of his cheek
2183,PART V,Was stained one moment by a flush of red.
2184,PART V,He swayed his lithe form nearer as he stood
2185,PART V,Still clinging to the branch above his head.
2186,PART V,"His brilliant eyes grew darker; and he said,"
2187,PART V,"With sudden passion, “Do you bid me speak?"
2188,PART V,"I cannot, then, keep silence if I would."
2189,PART V,"That hateful fortune, coming as it did,"
2190,PART V,Forbade my speaking sooner; for I knew
2191,PART V,A harsh-tongued world would quickly misconstrue
2192,PART V,"My motive for a meaner one.  But, sweet,"
2193,PART V,So big my heart has grown with love for you
2194,PART V,I cannot shelter it or keep it hid.
2195,PART V,"And so I cast it throbbing at your feet,"
2196,PART V,"For you to guard and cherish, or to break."
2197,PART V,"Maurine, I love you better than my life."
2198,PART V,"My friend—my cousin—be still more, my wife!"
2199,PART V,"Maurine, Maurine, what answer do you make?”"
2200,PART V,
2201,PART V,I scarce could breathe for wonderment; and numb
2202,PART V,"With truth that fell too suddenly, sat dumb"
2203,PART V,"With sheer amaze, and stared at Roy with eyes"
2204,PART V,That looked no feeling but complete surprise.
2205,PART V,He swayed so near his breath was on my cheek.
2206,PART V,"“Maurine, Maurine,” he whispered, “will you speak?”"
2207,PART V,
2208,PART V,"Then suddenly, as o’er some magic glass"
2209,PART V,"One picture in a score of shapes will pass,"
2210,PART V,I seemed to see Roy glide before my gaze.
2211,PART V,"First, as the playmate of my earlier days—"
2212,PART V,"Next, as my kin—and then my valued friend,"
2213,PART V,"And last, my lover.  As when colours blend"
2214,PART V,"In some unlooked-for group before our eyes,"
2215,PART V,"We hold the glass, and look them o’er and o’er,"
2216,PART V,"So now I gazed on Roy in his new guise,"
2217,PART V,In which he ne’er appeared to me before.
2218,PART V,
2219,PART V,"His form was like a panther’s in its grace,"
2220,PART V,"So lithe and supple, and of medium height,"
2221,PART V,And garbed in all the elegance of fashion.
2222,PART V,"His large black eyes were full of fire and passion,"
2223,PART V,"And in expression fearless, firm, and bright."
2224,PART V,"His hair was like the very deeps of night,"
2225,PART V,And hung in raven clusters ’round a face
2226,PART V,Of dark and flashing beauty.
2227,PART V,
2228,PART V,He was more
2229,PART V,Like some romantic maiden’s grand ideal
2230,PART V,Than like a common being.  As I gazed
2231,PART V,"Upon the handsome face to mine upraised,"
2232,PART V,"I saw before me, living, breathing, real,"
2233,PART V,The hero of my early day-dreams: though
2234,PART V,"So full my heart was with that clear-cut face,"
2235,PART V,"Which, all unlike, yet claimed the hero’s place,"
2236,PART V,"I had not recognised him so before,"
2237,PART V,"Or thought of him, save as a valued friend."
2238,PART V,"So now I called him, adding,"
2239,PART V,
2240,PART V,“Foolish boy!
2241,PART V,Each word of love you utter aims a blow
2242,PART V,At that sweet trust I had reposed in you.
2243,PART V,"I was so certain I had found a true,"
2244,PART V,"Steadfast man friend, on whom I could depend,"
2245,PART V,And go on wholly trusting to the end.
2246,PART V,"Why did you shatter my delusion, Roy,"
2247,PART V,By turning to a lover?”
2248,PART V,
2249,PART V,"“Why, indeed!"
2250,PART V,"Because I loved you more than any brother,"
2251,PART V,Or any friend could love.”  Then he began
2252,PART V,"To argue like a lawyer, and to plead"
2253,PART V,"With all his eloquence.  And, listening,"
2254,PART V,I strove to think it was a goodly thing
2255,PART V,"To be so fondly loved by such a man,"
2256,PART V,"And it were best to give his wooing heed,"
2257,PART V,"And not deny him.  Then before my eyes,"
2258,PART V,"In all its clear-cut majesty, that other"
2259,PART V,Haughty and poet-handsome face would rise
2260,PART V,And rob my purpose of all life and strength.
2261,PART V,
2262,PART V,"Roy urged and argued, as Roy only could,"
2263,PART V,"With that impetuous, boyish eloquence."
2264,PART V,"He held my hands, and vowed I must, and should"
2265,PART V,"Give some least hope; till, in my own defence,"
2266,PART V,"I turned upon him, and replied at length:"
2267,PART V,“I thank you for the noble heart you offer:
2268,PART V,But it deserves a true one in exchange.
2269,PART V,I could love you if I loved not another
2270,PART V,Who keeps my heart; so I have none to proffer.”
2271,PART V,
2272,PART V,"Then, seeing how his dark eyes flashed, I said:"
2273,PART V,“Dear Roy!  I know my words seem very strange;
2274,PART V,But I love one I cannot hope to wed.
2275,PART V,"A river rolls between us, dark and deep."
2276,PART V,To cross it—were to stain with blood my hand.
2277,PART V,You force my speech on what I fain would keep
2278,PART V,"In my own bosom, but you understand?"
2279,PART V,"My heart is given to love that’s sanctified,"
2280,PART V,And now can feel no other.
2281,PART V,
2282,PART V,"Be you kind,"
2283,PART V,"Dear Roy, my brother! speak of this no more,"
2284,PART V,Lest pleading and denying should divide
2285,PART V,The hearts so long united.  Let me find
2286,PART V,In you my cousin and my friend of yore.
2287,PART V,"And now come home.  The morning, all too soon"
2288,PART V,"And unperceived, has melted into noon."
2289,PART V,"Helen will miss us, and we must return.”"
2290,PART V,
2291,PART V,"He took my hand, and helped me to arise,"
2292,PART V,"Smiling upon me with his sad, dark eyes,"
2293,PART V,"Where passion’s fires had, sudden, ceased to burn."
2294,PART V,
2295,PART V,"“And so,” he said, “too soon and unforeseen"
2296,PART V,"My friendship melted into love, Maurine."
2297,PART V,"But, sweet!  I am not wholly in the blame"
2298,PART V,"For what you term my folly.  You forgot,"
2299,PART V,"So long we’d known each other, I had not"
2300,PART V,In truth a brother’s or a cousin’s claim.
2301,PART V,"But I remembered, when through every nerve"
2302,PART V,Your lightest touch went thrilling; and began
2303,PART V,To love you with that human love of man
2304,PART V,"For comely woman.  By your coaxing arts,"
2305,PART V,"You won your way into my heart of hearts,"
2306,PART V,And all Platonic feelings put to rout.
2307,PART V,A maid should never lay aside reserve
2308,PART V,"With one who’s not her kinsman, out and out."
2309,PART V,"But as we now, with measured steps, retrace"
2310,PART V,"The path we came, e’en so my heart I’ll send,"
2311,PART V,"At your command, back to the olden place,"
2312,PART V,And strive to love you only as a friend.”
2313,PART V,"I felt the justice of his mild reproof,"
2314,PART V,"But answered, laughing, “’Tis the same old cry:"
2315,PART V,"‘The woman tempted me, and I did eat.’"
2316,PART V,Since Adam’s time we’ve heard it.  But I’ll try
2317,PART V,"And be more prudent, sir, and hold aloof"
2318,PART V,The fruit I never once had thought so sweet
2319,PART V,"’Twould tempt you any.  Now go dress for dinner,"
2320,PART V,Thou sinned against! as also will the sinner.
2321,PART V,"And guard each act, that no least look betray"
2322,PART V,What’s passed between us.”
2323,PART V,
2324,PART V,Then I turned away
2325,PART V,"And sought my room, low humming some old air"
2326,PART V,That ceased upon the threshold; for mine eyes
2327,PART V,Fell on a face so glorified and fair
2328,PART V,"All other senses, merged in that of sight,"
2329,PART V,Were lost in contemplation of the bright
2330,PART V,"And wond’rous picture, which had otherwise"
2331,PART V,Made dim my vision.
2332,PART V,
2333,PART V,"Waiting in my room,"
2334,PART V,Her whole face lit as by an inward flame
2335,PART V,"That shed its halo ’round her, Helen stood;"
2336,PART V,Her fair hands folded like a lily’s leaves
2337,PART V,Weighed down by happy dews of summer eves.
2338,PART V,Upon her cheek the colour went and came
2339,PART V,As sunlight flickers o’er a bed of bloom;
2340,PART V,"And, like some slim young sapling of the wood,"
2341,PART V,Her slender form leaned slightly; and her hair
2342,PART V,"Fell ’round her loosely, in long curling strands"
2343,PART V,"All unconfined, and as by loving hands"
2344,PART V,Tossed into bright confusion.
2345,PART V,
2346,PART V,"Standing there,"
2347,PART V,"Her starry eyes uplifted, she did seem"
2348,PART V,Like some unearthly creature of a dream;
2349,PART V,"Until she started forward, gliding slowly,"
2350,PART V,"And broke the breathless silence, speaking lowly,"
2351,PART V,"As one grown meek, and humble in an hour,"
2352,PART V,Bowing before some new and mighty power.
2353,PART V,
2354,PART V,"“Maurine, Maurine!” she murmured, and again,"
2355,PART V,"“Maurine, my own sweet friend, Maurine!”"
2356,PART V,
2357,PART V,"And then,"
2358,PART V,"Laying her love-light hands upon my head,"
2359,PART V,"She leaned, and looked into my eyes, and said"
2360,PART V,"With voice that bore her joy in ev’ry tone,"
2361,PART V,As winds that blow across a garden bed
2362,PART V,"Are weighed with fragrance, “He is mine alone,"
2363,PART V,And I am his—all his—his very own.
2364,PART V,"So pledged this hour, by that most sacred tie"
2365,PART V,Save one beneath God’s over-arching sky.
2366,PART V,I could not wait to tell you of my bliss:
2367,PART V,"I want your blessing, sweetheart! and your kiss.”"
2368,PART V,"So hiding my heart’s trouble with a smile,"
2369,PART V,I leaned and kissed her dainty mouth; the while
2370,PART V,"I felt a guilt-joy, as of some sweet sin,"
2371,PART V,When my lips fell where his so late had been.
2372,PART V,And all day long I bore about with me
2373,PART V,"A sense of shame—yet mixed with satisfaction,"
2374,PART V,"As some starved child might steal a loaf, and be"
2375,PART V,"Sad with the guilt resulting from her action,"
2376,PART V,While yet the morsel in her mouth was sweet.
2377,PART V,That ev’ning when the house had settled down
2378,PART V,"To sleep and quiet, to my room there crept"
2379,PART V,"A lithe young form, robed in a long white gown:"
2380,PART V,"With steps like fall of thistle-down she came,"
2381,PART V,"Her mouth smile-wreathed; and, breathing low my name,"
2382,PART V,Nestled in graceful beauty at my feet.
2383,PART V,
2384,PART V,"“Sweetheart,” she murmured softly, “ere I sleep,"
2385,PART V,I needs must tell you all my tale of joy.
2386,PART V,Beginning where you left us—you and Roy.
2387,PART V,You saw the colour flame upon my cheek
2388,PART V,When Vivian spoke of staying.  So did he;—
2389,PART V,"And, when we were alone, he gazed at me"
2390,PART V,With such a strange look in his wond’rous eyes.
2391,PART V,The silence deepened; and I tried to speak
2392,PART V,"Upon some common topic, but could not,"
2393,PART V,My heart was in such tumult.
2394,PART V,
2395,PART V,In this wise
2396,PART V,"Five happy moments glided by us, fraught"
2397,PART V,"With hours of feeling.  Vivian rose up then,"
2398,PART V,"And came and stood by me, and stroked my hair."
2399,PART V,"And, in his low voice, o’er and o’er again,"
2400,PART V,"Said, ‘Helen, little Helen, frail and fair.’"
2401,PART V,"Then took my face, and turned it to the light,"
2402,PART V,"And looking in my eyes, and seeing what"
2403,PART V,"Was shining from them, murmured, sweet and low,"
2404,PART V,"‘Dear eyes, you cannot veil the truth from sight."
2405,PART V,"You love me, Helen! answer, is it so?’"
2406,PART V,"And I made answer straightway, ‘With my life"
2407,PART V,"And soul and strength I love you, O my love!’"
2408,PART V,"He leaned and took me gently to his breast,"
2409,PART V,"And said, ‘Here then this dainty head shall rest"
2410,PART V,Henceforth for ever: O my little dove!
2411,PART V,My lily-bud—my fragile blossom-wife!’
2412,PART V,
2413,PART V,And then I told him all my thoughts; and he
2414,PART V,"Listened, with kisses for his comments, till"
2415,PART V,"My tale was finished.  Then he said, ‘I will"
2416,PART V,"Be frank with you, my darling, from the start,"
2417,PART V,And hide no secret from you in my heart.
2418,PART V,"I love you, Helen, but you are not first"
2419,PART V,To rouse that love to being.  Ere we met
2420,PART V,I loved a woman madly—never dreaming
2421,PART V,She was not all in truth she was in seeming.
2422,PART V,Enough! she proved to be that thing accursed
2423,PART V,Of God and man—a wily vain coquette.
2424,PART V,I hate myself for having loved her.  Yet
2425,PART V,"So much my heart spent on her, it must give"
2426,PART V,"A love less ardent, and less prodigal,"
2427,PART V,Albeit just as tender and as true—
2428,PART V,"A milder, yet a faithful love to you."
2429,PART V,Just as some evil fortune might befall
2430,PART V,"A man’s great riches, causing him to live"
2431,PART V,"In some low cot, all unpretending, still"
2432,PART V,"As much his home—as much his loved retreat,"
2433,PART V,"As was the princely palace on the hill,"
2434,PART V,"E’en so I give you all that’s left, my sweet!"
2435,PART V,Of my heart-fortune.’
2436,PART V,
2437,PART V,"‘That were more to me,’"
2438,PART V,"I made swift smiling answer, ‘than to be"
2439,PART V,The worshipped consort of a king.’  And so
2440,PART V,Our faith was pledged.  But Vivian would not go
2441,PART V,Until I vowed to wed him New Year day.
2442,PART V,And I am sad because you go away
2443,PART V,Before that time.  I shall not feel half wed
2444,PART V,"Without you here.  Postpone your trip and stay,"
2445,PART V,And be my bridesmaid.”
2446,PART V,
2447,PART V,"“Nay, I cannot, dear!"
2448,PART V,’Twould disarrange our plans for half a year.
2449,PART V,"I’ll be in Europe New Year day,” I said,"
2450,PART V,“And send congratulations by the cable.”
2451,PART V,And from my soul thanked Providence for sparing
2452,PART V,"The pain, to me, of sharing in, and wearing,"
2453,PART V,"The festal garments of a wedding scene,"
2454,PART V,While all my heart was hung with sorrow’s sable.
2455,PART V,"Forgetting for a season, that between"
2456,PART V,"The cup and lip lies many a chance of loss,"
2457,PART V,"I lived in my near future, confident"
2458,PART V,"All would be as I planned it; and, across"
2459,PART V,"The briny waste of waters, I should find"
2460,PART V,Some balm and comfort for my troubled mind.
2461,PART V,"The sad Fall days, like maidens auburn-tressed"
2462,PART V,"And amber-eyed, in purple garments dressed,"
2463,PART V,"Passed by, and dropped their tears upon the tomb"
2464,PART V,"Of fair Queen Summer, buried in her bloom."
2465,PART V,
2466,PART V,"Roy left us for a time, and Helen went"
2467,PART V,"To make the nuptial preparations.  Then,"
2468,PART V,Aunt Ruth complained one day of feeling ill:
2469,PART V,Her veins ran red with fever; and the skill
2470,PART V,Of two physicians could not stem the tide.
2471,PART V,"The house, that rang so late with laugh and jest,"
2472,PART V,Grew ghostly with low whispered sounds: and when
2473,PART V,"The Autumn day, that I had thought to be"
2474,PART V,"Bounding upon the billows of the sea,"
2475,PART V,"Came sobbing in, it found me pale and worn,"
2476,PART V,Striving to keep away that unloved guest
2477,PART V,"Who comes unbidden, making hearts to mourn."
2478,PART V,Through all the anxious weeks I watched beside
2479,PART V,"The suff’rer’s couch, Roy was my help and stay;"
2480,PART V,"Others were kind, but he alone each day"
2481,PART V,"Brought strength and comfort, by his cheerful face,"
2482,PART V,"And hopeful words, that fell in that sad place"
2483,PART V,Like rays of light upon a darkened way.
2484,PART V,"November passed; and Winter, crisp and chill,"
2485,PART V,In robes of ermine walked on plain and hill.
2486,PART V,Returning light and life dispelled the gloom
2487,PART V,That cheated Death had brought us from the tomb.
2488,PART V,"Aunt Ruth was saved, and slowly getting better—"
2489,PART V,"Was dressed each day, and walked about the room."
2490,PART V,"Then came one morning in the Eastern mail,"
2491,PART V,A little white-winged birdling of a letter.
2492,PART V,"I broke the seal and read,"
2493,PART V,
2494,PART V,"“Maurine, my own!"
2495,PART V,"I hear Aunt Ruth is better, and am glad."
2496,PART V,I felt so sorry for you; and so sad
2497,PART V,To think I left you when I did—alone
2498,PART V,"To bear your pain and worry, and those nights"
2499,PART V,"Of weary, anxious watching."
2500,PART V,
2501,PART V,Vivian writes
2502,PART V,"Your plans are changed now, and you will not sail"
2503,PART V,Before the Springtime.  So you’ll come and be
2504,PART V,"My bridesmaid, darling!  Do not say me nay."
2505,PART V,But three weeks more of girlhood left to me.
2506,PART V,"Come, if you can, just two weeks from to-day,"
2507,PART V,And make your preparations here.  My sweet!
2508,PART V,Indeed I am not glad Aunt Ruth was ill—
2509,PART V,I’m sorry she has suffered so; and still
2510,PART V,"I’m thankful something happened, so you stayed."
2511,PART V,I’m sure my wedding would be incomplete
2512,PART V,"Without your presence.  Selfish, I’m afraid"
2513,PART V,"You’ll think your Helen.  But I love you so,"
2514,PART V,How can I be quite willing you should go?
2515,PART V,"Come Christmas Eve, or earlier.  Let me know,"
2516,PART V,"And I will meet you, dearie! at the train."
2517,PART V,"Your happy, loving Helen.”"
2518,PART V,
2519,PART V,Then the pain
2520,PART V,"That, hidden under later pain and care,"
2521,PART V,"Had made no moan, but silent, seemed to sleep,"
2522,PART V,"Woke from its trance-like lethargy, to steep"
2523,PART V,My tortured heart in anguish and despair.
2524,PART V,
2525,PART V,I had relied too fully on my skill
2526,PART V,In bending circumstances to my will:
2527,PART V,And now I was rebuked and made to see
2528,PART V,That God alone knoweth what is to be.
2529,PART V,"Then came a messenger from Vivian, who"
2530,PART V,"Came not himself, as he was wont to do,"
2531,PART V,But sent his servant each new day to bring
2532,PART V,"A kindly message, or an offering"
2533,PART V,"Of juicy fruits to cool the lips of fever,"
2534,PART V,"Or dainty hot-house blossoms, with their bloom"
2535,PART V,To brighten up the convalescent’s room.
2536,PART V,But now the servant only brought a line
2537,PART V,"From Vivian Dangerfield to Roy Montaine,"
2538,PART V,"“Dear Sir, and Friend”—in letters bold and plain,"
2539,PART V,"Written on cream-white paper, so it ran:"
2540,PART V,"“It is the will and pleasure of Miss Trevor,"
2541,PART V,"And therefore doubly so a wish of mine,"
2542,PART V,"That you shall honour me next New Year Eve,"
2543,PART V,"My wedding hour, by standing as best man."
2544,PART V,Miss Trevor has six bridesmaids I believe.
2545,PART V,Being myself a novice in the art—
2546,PART V,"If I should fail in acting well my part,"
2547,PART V,I’ll need protection ’gainst the regiment
2548,PART V,"Of outraged ladies.  So, I pray, consent"
2549,PART V,"To stand by me in time of need, and shield"
2550,PART V,"Your friend sincerely, Vivian Dangerfield.”"
2551,PART V,
2552,PART V,"The last least hope had vanished; I must drain,"
2553,PART V,"E’en to the dregs, this bitter cup of pain."
2554,PART V,
2555,PART V,
2556,PART V,
2557,PART VI,PART VI
2558,PART VI,
2559,PART VI,
2560,PART VI,There was a week of bustle and of hurry;
2561,PART VI,"A stately home echoed to voices sweet,"
2562,PART VI,"Calling, replying; and to tripping feet"
2563,PART VI,"Of busy bridesmaids, running to and fro,"
2564,PART VI,With all that girlish fluttering and flurry
2565,PART VI,Preceding such occasions.
2566,PART VI,
2567,PART VI,Helen’s room
2568,PART VI,"Was like a lily-garden, all in bloom,"
2569,PART VI,Decked with the dainty robes of her trousseau.
2570,PART VI,"My robe was fashioned by swift, skilful hands—"
2571,PART VI,"A thing of beauty, elegant and rich,"
2572,PART VI,"A mystery of loopings, puffs and bands;"
2573,PART VI,"And as I watched it growing, stitch by stitch,"
2574,PART VI,I felt as one might feel who should behold
2575,PART VI,"With vision trance-like, where his body lay"
2576,PART VI,"In deathly slumber, simulating clay,"
2577,PART VI,"His grave-cloth sewed together, fold on fold."
2578,PART VI,
2579,PART VI,"I lived with ev’ry nerve upon the strain,"
2580,PART VI,"As men go into battle; and the pain,"
2581,PART VI,"That, more and more, to my sad heart revealed"
2582,PART VI,"Grew ghastly with its horrors, was concealed"
2583,PART VI,"From mortal eyes by superhuman power,"
2584,PART VI,"That God bestowed upon me, hour by hour."
2585,PART VI,What night the Old Year gave unto the New
2586,PART VI,"The key of human happiness and woe,"
2587,PART VI,"The pointed stars, upon their field of blue,"
2588,PART VI,"Shone, white and perfect, o’er a world below,"
2589,PART VI,Of snow-clad beauty; all the trees were dressed
2590,PART VI,"In gleaming garments, decked with diadems,"
2591,PART VI,"Each seeming like a bridal-bidden guest,"
2592,PART VI,Coming o’erladen with a gift of gems.
2593,PART VI,The bustle of the dressing-room; the sound
2594,PART VI,Of eager voices in discourse; the clang
2595,PART VI,Of “sweet bells jangled”; thud of steel-clad feet
2596,PART VI,That beat swift music on the frozen ground—
2597,PART VI,"All blent together in my brain, and rang"
2598,PART VI,"A medley of strange noises, incomplete,"
2599,PART VI,And full of discords.
2600,PART VI,
2601,PART VI,Then out on the night
2602,PART VI,"Streamed from the open vestibule, a light"
2603,PART VI,"That lit the velvet blossoms which we trod,"
2604,PART VI,With all the hues of those that deck the sod.
2605,PART VI,The grand cathedral windows were ablaze
2606,PART VI,"With gorgeous colours; through a sea of bloom,"
2607,PART VI,"Up the long aisle, to join the waiting groom,"
2608,PART VI,The bridal cortège passed.
2609,PART VI,
2610,PART VI,As some lost soul
2611,PART VI,"Might surge on with the curious crowd, to gaze"
2612,PART VI,"Upon its coffined body, so I went"
2613,PART VI,With that glad festal throng.  The organ sent
2614,PART VI,"Great waves of melody along the air,"
2615,PART VI,"That broke and fell, in liquid drops, like spray,"
2616,PART VI,On happy hearts that listened.  But to me
2617,PART VI,"It sounded faintly, as if miles away,"
2618,PART VI,"A troubled spirit, sitting in despair"
2619,PART VI,"Beside the sad and ever-moaning sea,"
2620,PART VI,Gave utterance to sighing sounds of dole.
2621,PART VI,"We paused before the altar.  Framed in flowers,"
2622,PART VI,The white-robed man of God stood forth.
2623,PART VI,
2624,PART VI,I heard
2625,PART VI,The solemn service open; through long hours
2626,PART VI,"I seemed to stand and listen, while each word"
2627,PART VI,Fell on my ear as falls the sound of clay
2628,PART VI,Upon the coffin of the worshipped dead.
2629,PART VI,The stately father gave the bride away:
2630,PART VI,The bridegroom circled with a golden band
2631,PART VI,The taper finger of her dainty hand.
2632,PART VI,"The last imposing, binding words were said—"
2633,PART VI,“What God has joined let no man put asunder”—
2634,PART VI,And all my strife with self was at an end;
2635,PART VI,My lover was the husband of my friend.
2636,PART VI,
2637,PART VI,"How strangely, in some awful hour of pain,"
2638,PART VI,External trifles with our sorrows blend!
2639,PART VI,"I never hear the mighty organ’s thunder,"
2640,PART VI,"I never catch the scent of heliotrope,"
2641,PART VI,"Nor see stained windows all ablaze with light,"
2642,PART VI,"Without that dizzy whirling of the brain,"
2643,PART VI,"And all the ghastly feeling of that night,"
2644,PART VI,When my sick heart relinquished love and hope.
2645,PART VI,
2646,PART VI,"The pain we feel so keenly may depart,"
2647,PART VI,And e’en its memory cease to haunt the heart:
2648,PART VI,"But some slight thing, a perfume, or a sound"
2649,PART VI,"Will probe the closed recesses of the wound,"
2650,PART VI,And for a moment bring the old-time smart.
2651,PART VI,
2652,PART VI,"Congratulations, kisses, tears and smiles,"
2653,PART VI,Good-byes and farewells given; then across
2654,PART VI,"The snowy waste of weary wintry miles,"
2655,PART VI,"Back to my girlhoods’ home, where, through each room,"
2656,PART VI,For evermore pale phantoms of delight
2657,PART VI,"Should aimless wander, always in my sight,"
2658,PART VI,"Pointing, with ghostly fingers, to the tomb"
2659,PART VI,Wet with the tears of living pain and loss.
2660,PART VI,
2661,PART VI,"The sleepless nights of watching and of care,"
2662,PART VI,"Followed by that one week of keenest pain,"
2663,PART VI,"Taxing my weakened system, and my brain,"
2664,PART VI,Brought on a ling’ring illness.
2665,PART VI,
2666,PART VI,"Day by day,"
2667,PART VI,"In that strange, apathetic state I lay,"
2668,PART VI,Of mental and of physical despair.
2669,PART VI,"I had no pain, no fever, and no chill,"
2670,PART VI,"But lay without ambition, strength, or will."
2671,PART VI,"Knowing no wish for anything but rest,"
2672,PART VI,"Which seemed, of all God’s store of gifts, the best."
2673,PART VI,
2674,PART VI,Physicians came and shook their heads and sighed;
2675,PART VI,"And to their score of questions I replied,"
2676,PART VI,"With but one languid answer, o’er and o’er,"
2677,PART VI,“I am so weary—weary—nothing more.”
2678,PART VI,
2679,PART VI,"I slept, and dreamed I was some feathered thing,"
2680,PART VI,"Flying through space with ever-aching wing,"
2681,PART VI,"Seeking a ship called Rest all snowy white,"
2682,PART VI,"That sailed and sailed before me, just in sight,"
2683,PART VI,"But always one unchanging distance kept,"
2684,PART VI,And woke more weary than before I slept.
2685,PART VI,
2686,PART VI,"I slept, and dreamed I ran to win a prize,"
2687,PART VI,A hand from heaven held down before my eyes.
2688,PART VI,"All eagerness I sought it—it was gone,"
2689,PART VI,But shone in all its beauty farther on.
2690,PART VI,"I ran, and ran, and ran, in eager quest"
2691,PART VI,"Of that great prize, whereon was written “Rest,”"
2692,PART VI,"Which ever just beyond my reach did gleam,"
2693,PART VI,And wakened doubly weary with my dream.
2694,PART VI,
2695,PART VI,"I dreamed I was a crystal drop of rain,"
2696,PART VI,"That saw a snow-white lily on the plain,"
2697,PART VI,And left the cloud to nestle in her breast.
2698,PART VI,"I fell and fell, but nevermore found rest—"
2699,PART VI,"I fell and fell, but found no stopping place,"
2700,PART VI,"Through leagues and leagues of never-ending space,"
2701,PART VI,While space illimitable stretched before.
2702,PART VI,
2703,PART VI,And all these dreams but wearied me the more.
2704,PART VI,
2705,PART VI,Familiar voices sounded in my room—
2706,PART VI,"Aunt Ruth’s, and Roy’s, and Helen’s: but they seemed"
2707,PART VI,"A part of some strange fancy I had dreamed,"
2708,PART VI,And now remembered dimly.
2709,PART VI,
2710,PART VI,"Wrapped in gloom,"
2711,PART VI,"My mind, o’ertaxed, lost hold of time at last,"
2712,PART VI,"Ignored its future, and forgot its past,"
2713,PART VI,"And groped along the present, as a light,"
2714,PART VI,"Carried, uncovered, through the fogs of night,"
2715,PART VI,Will flicker faintly.
2716,PART VI,
2717,PART VI,"But I felt, at length,"
2718,PART VI,"When March winds brought vague rumours of the spring,"
2719,PART VI,A certain sense of “restlessness with rest.”
2720,PART VI,"My aching frame was weary of repose,"
2721,PART VI,And wanted action.
2722,PART VI,
2723,PART VI,Then slow-creeping strength
2724,PART VI,"Came back with Mem’ry, hand in hand, to bring"
2725,PART VI,"And lay upon my sore and bleeding breast,"
2726,PART VI,Grim-visaged Recollection’s thorny rose.
2727,PART VI,"I gained, and failed.  One day could ride and walk,"
2728,PART VI,The next would find me prostrate: while a flock
2729,PART VI,"Of ghostly thoughts, like phantom birds, would flit"
2730,PART VI,"About the chambers of my heart, or sit,"
2731,PART VI,"Pale spectres of the past, with folded wings,"
2732,PART VI,"Perched, silently, upon the voiceless strings,"
2733,PART VI,That once resounded to Hope’s happy lays.
2734,PART VI,
2735,PART VI,So passed the ever-changing April days.
2736,PART VI,"When May came, lightsome footed, o’er the lea,"
2737,PART VI,"Accompanied by kind Aunt Ruth and Roy,"
2738,PART VI,"I bade farewell to home with secret joy,"
2739,PART VI,And turned my wan face eastward to the sea.
2740,PART VI,Roy planned our route of travel: for all lands
2741,PART VI,"Were one to him.  Or Egypt’s burning sands,"
2742,PART VI,"Or Alps of Switzerland, or stately Rome,"
2743,PART VI,All were familiar as the fields of home.
2744,PART VI,
2745,PART VI,"There was a year of wand’ring to and fro,"
2746,PART VI,Like restless spirits; scaling mountain heights;
2747,PART VI,"Dwelling among the countless, rare delights"
2748,PART VI,"Of lands historic; turning dusty pages,"
2749,PART VI,Stamped with the tragedies of mighty ages
2750,PART VI,"Gazing upon the scenes of bloody acts,"
2751,PART VI,"Of kings long buried—bare, unvarnished facts,"
2752,PART VI,Surpassing wildest fictions of the brain;
2753,PART VI,"Rubbing against all people, high and low,"
2754,PART VI,And by this contact feeling Self to grow
2755,PART VI,"Smaller and less important, and the vein"
2756,PART VI,"Of human kindness deeper, seeing God,"
2757,PART VI,"Unto the humble delver of the sod,"
2758,PART VI,"And to the ruling monarch on the throne,"
2759,PART VI,"Has given hope, ambition, joy, and pain,"
2760,PART VI,And that all hearts have feelings like our own.
2761,PART VI,
2762,PART VI,"There is no school that disciplines the mind,"
2763,PART VI,"And broadens thought, like contact with mankind."
2764,PART VI,"The college-prisoned graybeard, who has burned"
2765,PART VI,"The midnight lamp, and book-bound knowledge learned,"
2766,PART VI,Till sciences or classics hold no lore
2767,PART VI,"He has not conned and studied, o’er and o’er,"
2768,PART VI,"Is but a babe in wisdom, when compared"
2769,PART VI,"With some unlettered wand’rer, who has shared"
2770,PART VI,The hospitalities of every land;
2771,PART VI,Felt touch of brother in each proffered hand;
2772,PART VI,"Made man his study, and the world his college,"
2773,PART VI,And gained this grand epitome of knowledge:
2774,PART VI,"Each human being has a heart and soul,"
2775,PART VI,And self is but an atom of the whole.
2776,PART VI,I hold he is best learnèd and most wise
2777,PART VI,Who best and most can love and sympathize.
2778,PART VI,Book-wisdom makes us vain and self-contained;
2779,PART VI,Our banded minds go round in little grooves;
2780,PART VI,But constant friction with the world removes
2781,PART VI,"These iron foes to freedom, and we rise"
2782,PART VI,"To grander heights, and, all untrammelled, find"
2783,PART VI,A better atmosphere and clearer skies;
2784,PART VI,"And through its broadened realm, no longer chained,"
2785,PART VI,"Thought travels freely, leaving Self behind."
2786,PART VI,"Where’er we chanced to wander or to roam,"
2787,PART VI,"Glad letters came from Helen; happy things,"
2788,PART VI,"Like little birds that followed on swift wings,"
2789,PART VI,Bringing their tender messages from home.
2790,PART VI,"Her days were poems, beautiful, complete."
2791,PART VI,"The rhythm perfect, and the burden sweet."
2792,PART VI,"She was so happy—happy, and so blest."
2793,PART VI,
2794,PART VI,My heart had found contentment in that year.
2795,PART VI,"With health restored, my life seemed full of cheer"
2796,PART VI,The heart of youth turns ever to the light;
2797,PART VI,"Sorrow and gloom may curtain it like night,"
2798,PART VI,"But, in its very anguish and unrest,"
2799,PART VI,"It beats and tears the pall-like folds away,"
2800,PART VI,And finds again the sunlight of the day.
2801,PART VI,
2802,PART VI,"And yet, despite the changes without measure,"
2803,PART VI,"Despite sight-seeing, round on round of pleasure;"
2804,PART VI,"Despite new friends, new suitors, still my heart"
2805,PART VI,"Was conscious of a something lacking, where"
2806,PART VI,"Love once had dwelt, and afterward despair."
2807,PART VI,Now love was buried; and despair had flown
2808,PART VI,Before the healthful zephyrs that had blown
2809,PART VI,From heights serene and lofty; and the place
2810,PART VI,"Where both had dwelt was empty, voiceless space."
2811,PART VI,"And so I took my long-loved study, art,"
2812,PART VI,"The dreary vacuum in my life to fill,"
2813,PART VI,"And worked, and laboured, with a right good will."
2814,PART VI,Aunt Ruth and I took rooms in Rome; while Roy
2815,PART VI,"Lingered in Scotland, with his new-found joy."
2816,PART VI,"A dainty little lassie, Grace Kildare,"
2817,PART VI,"Had snared him in her flossy, flaxen hair,"
2818,PART VI,And made him captive.
2819,PART VI,
2820,PART VI,"We were thrown, by chance,"
2821,PART VI,In contact with her people while in France
2822,PART VI,The previous season: she was wholly sweet
2823,PART VI,"And fair and gentle; so naïve, and yet"
2824,PART VI,"So womanly, she was at once the pet"
2825,PART VI,"Of all our party; and, ere many days,"
2826,PART VI,"Won by her fresh face, and her artless ways,"
2827,PART VI,Roy fell a helpless captive at her feet.
2828,PART VI,Her home was in the Highlands; and she came
2829,PART VI,"Of good old stock, of fair untarnished fame."
2830,PART VI,
2831,PART VI,Through all these months Roy had been true as steel;
2832,PART VI,And by his every action made me feel
2833,PART VI,"He was my friend and brother, and no more,"
2834,PART VI,The same big-souled and trusty friend of yore.
2835,PART VI,"Yet, in my secret heart, I wished I knew"
2836,PART VI,"Whether the love he felt one time was dead,"
2837,PART VI,"Or only hidden, for my sake, from view."
2838,PART VI,"So when he came to me one day, and said,"
2839,PART VI,The velvet blackness of his eyes ashine
2840,PART VI,"With light of love and triumph: “Cousin, mine,"
2841,PART VI,Congratulate me!  She whom I adore
2842,PART VI,Has pledged to me the promise of her hand;
2843,PART VI,"Her heart I have already,” I was glad"
2844,PART VI,"With double gladness, for it freed my mind"
2845,PART VI,"Of fear that he, in secret, might be sad."
2846,PART VI,
2847,PART VI,"From March till June had left her moons behind,"
2848,PART VI,"And merged her rose-red beauty in July,"
2849,PART VI,There was no message from my native land.
2850,PART VI,"Then came a few brief lines, by Vivian penned:"
2851,PART VI,"Death had been near to Helen, but passed by;"
2852,PART VI,The danger was now over.  God was kind;
2853,PART VI,The mother and the child were both alive;
2854,PART VI,No other child was ever known to thrive
2855,PART VI,"As throve this one, nurse had been heard to say."
2856,PART VI,"The infant was a wonder, every way."
2857,PART VI,"And, at command of Helen, he would send"
2858,PART VI,A lock of baby’s golden hair to me.
2859,PART VI,"And did I, on my honour, ever see"
2860,PART VI,"Such hair before?  Helen would write, ere long:"
2861,PART VI,"She gained quite slowly, but would soon be strong—"
2862,PART VI,"Stronger than ever, so the doctors said."
2863,PART VI,"I took the tiny ringlet, golden—fair,"
2864,PART VI,Mayhap his hand had severed from the head
2865,PART VI,"Of his own child, and pressed it to my cheek"
2866,PART VI,"And to my lips, and kissed it o’er and o’er."
2867,PART VI,"All my maternal instincts seemed to rise,"
2868,PART VI,"And clamour for their rights, while my wet eyes"
2869,PART VI,Rained tears upon the silken tress of hair.
2870,PART VI,The woman struggled with her heart before!
2871,PART VI,"It was the mother in me now did speak,"
2872,PART VI,"Moaning, like Rachel, that her babes were not,"
2873,PART VI,And crying out against her barren lot.
2874,PART VI,
2875,PART VI,Once I bemoaned the long and lonely years
2876,PART VI,"That stretched before me, dark with love’s eclipse;"
2877,PART VI,And thought how my unmated heart would miss
2878,PART VI,The shelter of a broad and manly breast—
2879,PART VI,"The strong, bold arm—the tender clinging kiss—"
2880,PART VI,"And all pure love’s possessions, manifold;"
2881,PART VI,"But now I wept a flood of bitter tears,"
2882,PART VI,"Thinking of little heads of shining gold,"
2883,PART VI,That would not on my bosom sink to rest;
2884,PART VI,Of little hands that would not touch my cheek;
2885,PART VI,"Of little lisping voices, and sweet lips,"
2886,PART VI,That never in my list’ning ear would speak
2887,PART VI,The blessed name of mother.
2888,PART VI,
2889,PART VI,"Oh, in woman"
2890,PART VI,How mighty is the love of offspring!  Ere
2891,PART VI,"Unto her wond’ring, untaught mind unfolds"
2892,PART VI,"The myst’ry that is half divine, half human,"
2893,PART VI,"Of life and birth, the love of unborn souls"
2894,PART VI,"Within her, and the mother-yearning creeps"
2895,PART VI,"Through her warm heart, and stirs its hidden deeps,"
2896,PART VI,And grows and strengthens with each riper year.
2897,PART VI,
2898,PART VI,"As storms may gather in a placid sky,"
2899,PART VI,"And spend their fury, and then pass away,"
2900,PART VI,"Leaving again the blue of cloudless day,"
2901,PART VI,E’en so the tempest of my grief passed by.
2902,PART VI,"’Twas weak to mourn for what I had resigned,"
2903,PART VI,"With the deliberate purpose of my mind,"
2904,PART VI,To my sweet friend.
2905,PART VI,
2906,PART VI,"Relinquishing my love,"
2907,PART VI,I gave my dearest hope of joy to her.
2908,PART VI,"If God, from out His boundless store above,"
2909,PART VI,"Had chosen added blessings to confer,"
2910,PART VI,"I would rejoice, for her sake—not repine"
2911,PART VI,That th’ immortal treasures were not mine.
2912,PART VI,
2913,PART VI,"Better my lonely sorrow, than to know"
2914,PART VI,My selfish joy had been another’s woe;
2915,PART VI,"Better my grief and my strength to control,"
2916,PART VI,Than the despair of her frail-bodied soul;
2917,PART VI,"Better to go on, loveless, to the end,"
2918,PART VI,"Than wear love’s rose, whose thorn had slain my friend."
2919,PART VI,
2920,PART VI,Work is the salve that heals the wounded heart.
2921,PART VI,With will most resolute I set my aim
2922,PART VI,"To enter on the weary race for Fame,"
2923,PART VI,"And if I failed to climb the dizzy height,"
2924,PART VI,To reach some point of excellence in art.
2925,PART VI,
2926,PART VI,"E’en as the Maker held earth incomplete,"
2927,PART VI,"Till man was formed, and placed upon the sod,"
2928,PART VI,"The perfect, living image of his God,"
2929,PART VI,"All landscape scenes were lacking in my sight,"
2930,PART VI,Wherein the human figure had no part.
2931,PART VI,"In that, all lines of symmetry did meet—"
2932,PART VI,All hues of beauty mingle.  So I brought
2933,PART VI,"Enthusiasm in abundance, thought,"
2934,PART VI,"Much study, and some talent, day by day,"
2935,PART VI,To help me in my efforts to portray
2936,PART VI,"The wond’rous power, majesty and grace"
2937,PART VI,"Stamped on some form, or looking from some face."
2938,PART VI,This was to be my specialty: To take
2939,PART VI,"Human emotion for my theme, and make"
2940,PART VI,The unassisted form divine express
2941,PART VI,"Anger or Sorrow, Pleasure, Pain, Distress;"
2942,PART VI,And thus to build Fame’s monument above
2943,PART VI,The grave of my departed hope and love.
2944,PART VI,This is not Genius.  Genius spreads its wings
2945,PART VI,"And soars beyond itself, or selfish things."
2946,PART VI,"Talent has need of stepping-stones: some cross,"
2947,PART VI,"Some cheated purpose, some great pain or loss,"
2948,PART VI,"Must lay the groundwork, and arouse ambition,"
2949,PART VI,Before it labours onward to fruition.
2950,PART VI,
2951,PART VI,"But, as the lark from beds of bloom will rise"
2952,PART VI,"And sail and sing among the very skies,"
2953,PART VI,"Still mounting near and nearer to the light,"
2954,PART VI,"Impelled alone by love of upward flight,"
2955,PART VI,So Genius soars—it does not need to climb—
2956,PART VI,"Upon God-given wings, to heights sublime."
2957,PART VI,"Some sportman’s shot, grazing the singer’s throat,"
2958,PART VI,"Some venomous assault of birds of prey,"
2959,PART VI,"May speed its flight toward the realm of day,"
2960,PART VI,And tinge with triumph every liquid note.
2961,PART VI,"So deathless Genius mounts but higher yet,"
2962,PART VI,When Strife and Envy think to slay or fret.
2963,PART VI,
2964,PART VI,There is no balking Genius.  Only death
2965,PART VI,"Can silence it, or hinder.  While there’s breath"
2966,PART VI,"Or sense of feeling, it will spurn the sod,"
2967,PART VI,"And lift itself to glory, and to God."
2968,PART VI,The acorn sprouted—weeds nor flowers can choke
2969,PART VI,The certain growth of th’ upreaching oak.
2970,PART VI,
2971,PART VI,"Talent was mine, not Genius; and my mind"
2972,PART VI,"Seemed bound by chains, and would not leave behind"
2973,PART VI,Its selfish love and sorrow.
2974,PART VI,
2975,PART VI,Did I strive
2976,PART VI,"To picture some emotion, lo! _his_ eyes,"
2977,PART VI,"Of emerald beauty, dark as ocean dyes,"
2978,PART VI,Looked from the canvas: and my buried pain
2979,PART VI,"Rose from its grave, and stood by me alive."
2980,PART VI,"Whate’er my subject, in some hue or line,"
2981,PART VI,The glorious beauty of his face would shine.
2982,PART VI,
2983,PART VI,"So for a time my labour seemed in vain,"
2984,PART VI,"Since it but freshened, and made keener yet,"
2985,PART VI,The grief my heart was striving to forget.
2986,PART VI,While in his form all strength and magnitude
2987,PART VI,"With grace and supple sinews were entwined,"
2988,PART VI,While in his face all beauties were combined
2989,PART VI,"Of perfect features, intellect and truth,"
2990,PART VI,"With all that fine rich colouring of youth,"
2991,PART VI,How could my brush portray aught good or fair
2992,PART VI,Wherein no fatal likeness should intrude
2993,PART VI,Of him my soul had worshipped?
2994,PART VI,
2995,PART VI,"But, at last,"
2996,PART VI,"Setting a watch upon my unwise heart,"
2997,PART VI,"That thus would mix its sorrow with my art,"
2998,PART VI,"I resolutely shut away the past,"
2999,PART VI,And made the toilsome present passing bright
3000,PART VI,With dreams of what was hidden from my sight
3001,PART VI,"In the far distant future, when the soil"
3002,PART VI,Should yield me golden fruit for all my toil.
3003,PART VI,
3004,PART VI,
3005,PART VI,
3006,PART VII,PART VII
3007,PART VII,
3008,PART VII,
3009,PART VII,"With much hard labour and some pleasure fraught,"
3010,PART VII,"The months rolled by me noiselessly, that taught"
3011,PART VII,"My hand to grow more skilful in its art,"
3012,PART VII,"Strengthened my daring dream of fame, and brought"
3013,PART VII,Sweet hope and resignation to my heart.
3014,PART VII,
3015,PART VII,"Brief letters came from Helen, now and then:"
3016,PART VII,"She was quite well—oh yes! quite well, indeed!"
3017,PART VII,"But still so weak and nervous.  By-and-by,"
3018,PART VII,"When baby, being older, should not need"
3019,PART VII,"Such constant care, she would grow strong again."
3020,PART VII,She was as happy as a soul could be;
3021,PART VII,No least cloud hovered in her azure sky;
3022,PART VII,She had not thought life held such depths of bliss.
3023,PART VII,"Dear baby sent Maurine a loving kiss,"
3024,PART VII,"And said she was a naughty, naughty girl,"
3025,PART VII,Not to come home and see ma’s little pearl.
3026,PART VII,"No gift of costly jewels, or of gold,"
3027,PART VII,"Had been so precious or so dear to me,"
3028,PART VII,As each brief line wherein her joy was told.
3029,PART VII,"It lightened toil, and took the edge from pain,"
3030,PART VII,Knowing my sacrifice was not in vain.
3031,PART VII,
3032,PART VII,"Roy purchased fine estates in Scotland, where"
3033,PART VII,He built a pretty villa-like retreat.
3034,PART VII,And when the Roman Summer’s languid heat
3035,PART VII,"Made work a punishment, I turned my face"
3036,PART VII,"Toward the Highlands, and with Roy and Grace"
3037,PART VII,Found rest and freedom from all thought and care.
3038,PART VII,
3039,PART VII,I was a willing worker.  Not an hour
3040,PART VII,"Passed idly by me: each, I would employ"
3041,PART VII,"To some good purpose, ere it glided on"
3042,PART VII,To swell the tide of hours forever gone.
3043,PART VII,"My first completed picture, known as “Joy,”"
3044,PART VII,"Won pleasant words of praise.  “Possesses power,”"
3045,PART VII,"“Displays much talent,” “Very fairly done.”"
3046,PART VII,So fell the comments on my grateful ear.
3047,PART VII,
3048,PART VII,"Swift in the wake of Joy, and always near,"
3049,PART VII,Walks her sad sister Sorrow.  So my brush
3050,PART VII,"Began depicting Sorrow, heavy-eyed,"
3051,PART VII,"With pallid visage, ere the rosy flush"
3052,PART VII,Upon the beaming face of Joy had dried.
3053,PART VII,"The careful study of long months, it won"
3054,PART VII,Golden opinions; even bringing forth
3055,PART VII,That certain sign of merit—a critique
3056,PART VII,"Which set both pieces down as daubs, and weak"
3057,PART VII,As empty heads that sang their praises—so
3058,PART VII,Proving conclusively the pictures’ worth.
3059,PART VII,These critics and reviewers do not use
3060,PART VII,Their precious ammunition to abuse
3061,PART VII,"A worthless work.  That, left alone, they know"
3062,PART VII,Will find its proper level; and they aim
3063,PART VII,Their batteries at rising works which claim
3064,PART VII,Too much of public notice.  But this shot
3065,PART VII,"Resulted only in some noise, which brought"
3066,PART VII,"A dozen people, where one came before,"
3067,PART VII,To view my pictures; and I had my hour
3068,PART VII,"Of holding those frail baubles, Fame and Pow’r."
3069,PART VII,An English Baron who had lived two score
3070,PART VII,Of his allotted three score years and ten
3071,PART VII,"Bought both the pieces.  He was very kind,"
3072,PART VII,"And so attentive, I, not being blind,"
3073,PART VII,Must understand his meaning.
3074,PART VII,
3075,PART VII,"Therefore, when"
3076,PART VII,"He said,"
3077,PART VII,"“Sweet friend, whom I would make my wife,"
3078,PART VII,The ‘Joy’ and ‘Sorrow’ this dear hand portrayed
3079,PART VII,I have in my possession: now resign
3080,PART VII,"Into my careful keeping, and make mine,"
3081,PART VII,"The joy and sorrow of your future life,”—"
3082,PART VII,"I was prepared to answer, but delayed,"
3083,PART VII,Grown undecided suddenly.
3084,PART VII,
3085,PART VII,My mind
3086,PART VII,"Argued the matter coolly pro and con,"
3087,PART VII,And made resolve to speed his wooing on
3088,PART VII,And grant him favour.  He was good and kind;
3089,PART VII,"Not young, no doubt he would be quite content"
3090,PART VII,"With my respect, nor miss an ardent love;"
3091,PART VII,Could give me ties of family and home;
3092,PART VII,"And then, perhaps, my mind was not above"
3093,PART VII,Setting some value on a titled name—
3094,PART VII,Ambitious woman’s weakness!
3095,PART VII,
3096,PART VII,Then my art
3097,PART VII,"Would be encouraged and pursued the same,"
3098,PART VII,And I could spend my winters all in Rome.
3099,PART VII,Love never more could touch my wasteful heart
3100,PART VII,That all its wealth upon one object spent.
3101,PART VII,"Existence would be very bleak and cold,"
3102,PART VII,"After long years, when I was gray and old,"
3103,PART VII,With neither home nor children.
3104,PART VII,
3105,PART VII,"Once a wife,"
3106,PART VII,"I would forget the sorrow of my life,"
3107,PART VII,And pile new sods upon the grave of pain.
3108,PART VII,"My mind so argued; and my sad heart heard,"
3109,PART VII,But made no comment.
3110,PART VII,
3111,PART VII,"Then the Baron spoke,"
3112,PART VII,And waited for my answer.  All in vain
3113,PART VII,I strove for strength to utter that one word
3114,PART VII,My mind dictated.  Moments rolled away—
3115,PART VII,"Until at last my torpid heart awoke,"
3116,PART VII,And forced my trembling lips to say him nay.
3117,PART VII,"And then my eyes with sudden tears o’erran,"
3118,PART VII,In pity for myself and for this man
3119,PART VII,"Who stood before me, lost in pained surprise."
3120,PART VII,"“Dear friend,” I cried, “dear generous friend, forgive"
3121,PART VII,"A troubled woman’s weakness!  As I live,"
3122,PART VII,In truth I meant to answer otherwise.
3123,PART VII,"From out its store, my heart can give you naught"
3124,PART VII,But honour and respect; and yet methought
3125,PART VII,"I would give willing answer, did you sue."
3126,PART VII,But now I know ’twere cruel wrong I planned—
3127,PART VII,"Taking a heart that beat with love most true,"
3128,PART VII,And giving in exchange an empty hand.
3129,PART VII,"Who weds for love alone, may not be wise:"
3130,PART VII,"Who weds without it, angels must despise."
3131,PART VII,Love and respect together must combine
3132,PART VII,To render marriage holy and divine;
3133,PART VII,"And lack of either, sure as Fate, destroys"
3134,PART VII,"Continuation of the nuptial joys,"
3135,PART VII,"And brings regret, and gloomy discontent"
3136,PART VII,To put to rout each tender sentiment.
3137,PART VII,"Nay, nay!  I will not burden all your life"
3138,PART VII,By that possession—an unloving wife;
3139,PART VII,Nor will I take the sin upon my soul
3140,PART VII,Of wedding where my heart goes not in whole.
3141,PART VII,"However bleak may be my single lot,"
3142,PART VII,I will not stain my life with such a blot.
3143,PART VII,"Dear friend, farewell! the earth is very wide;"
3144,PART VII,It holds some fairer woman for your bride;
3145,PART VII,"I would I had a heart to give to you,"
3146,PART VII,"But, lacking it, can only say—adieu!”"
3147,PART VII,
3148,PART VII,"He whom temptation never has assailed,"
3149,PART VII,Knows not that subtle sense of moral strength;
3150,PART VII,"When sorely tried, we waver, but at length,"
3151,PART VII,"Rise up and turn away, not having failed."
3152,PART VII,
3153,PART VII,* * * * *
3154,PART VII,
3155,PART VII,The Autumn of the third year came and went;
3156,PART VII,"The mild Italian winter was half spent,"
3157,PART VII,When this brief message came across the sea:
3158,PART VII,“My darling!  I am dying.  Come to me.
3159,PART VII,"Love, which so long the growing truth concealed,"
3160,PART VII,"Stands pale within its shadow.  Oh, my sweet!"
3161,PART VII,This heart of mine grows fainter with each beat—
3162,PART VII,"Dying with very weight of bliss.  Oh, come!"
3163,PART VII,"And take the legacy I leave to you,"
3164,PART VII,Before these lips for evermore are dumb.
3165,PART VII,"In life or death,—Yours, Helen Dangerfield.”"
3166,PART VII,This plaintive letter bore a month old date;
3167,PART VII,"And, wild with fears lest I had come too late,"
3168,PART VII,"I bade the old world and new friends adieu,"
3169,PART VII,"And with Aunt Ruth, who long had sighed for home,"
3170,PART VII,"I turned my back on glory, art, and Rome."
3171,PART VII,
3172,PART VII,All selfish thoughts were merged in one wild fear
3173,PART VII,"That she for whose dear sake my heart had bled,"
3174,PART VII,"Rather than her sweet eyes should know one tear,"
3175,PART VII,Was passing from me; that she might be dead;
3176,PART VII,"And, dying, had been sorely grieved with me,"
3177,PART VII,Because I made no answer to her plea.
3178,PART VII,
3179,PART VII,"“O, ship, that sailest slowly, slowly on,"
3180,PART VII,Make haste before a wasting life is gone!
3181,PART VII,Make haste that I may catch a fleeting breath!
3182,PART VII,"And true in life, be true e’en unto death."
3183,PART VII,
3184,PART VII,"“O, ship, sail on! and bear me o’er the tide"
3185,PART VII,To her for whom my woman’s heart once died.
3186,PART VII,"Sail, sail, O, ship! for she hath need of me,"
3187,PART VII,And I would know what her last wish may be!
3188,PART VII,"I have been true, so true, through all the past."
3189,PART VII,"Sail, sail, O, ship!  I would not fail at last.”"
3190,PART VII,
3191,PART VII,"So prayed my heart still o’er, and ever o’er,"
3192,PART VII,Until the weary lagging ship reached shore.
3193,PART VII,"All sad with fears that I had come too late,"
3194,PART VII,"By that strange source whence men communicate,"
3195,PART VII,"Though miles on miles of space between them lie,"
3196,PART VII,I spoke with Vivian: “Does she live?  Reply.”
3197,PART VII,"The answer came.  “She lives, but hasten, friend!"
3198,PART VII,Her journey draweth swiftly to its end.”
3199,PART VII,
3200,PART VII,"Ah me! ah me! when each remembered spot,"
3201,PART VII,"My own dear home, the lane that led to his—"
3202,PART VII,"The fields, the woods, the lake, burst on my sight,"
3203,PART VII,"Oh! then, Self rose up in asserting might;"
3204,PART VII,"Oh, then, my bursting heart all else forgot,"
3205,PART VII,"But those sweet early years of lost delight,"
3206,PART VII,"Of hope, defeat, of anguish and of bliss."
3207,PART VII,
3208,PART VII,"I have a theory, vague, undefined,"
3209,PART VII,"That each emotion of the human mind,"
3210,PART VII,"Love, pain or passion, sorrow or despair,"
3211,PART VII,"Is a live spirit, dwelling in the air,"
3212,PART VII,Until it takes possession of some breast;
3213,PART VII,"And, when at length, grown weary of unrest,"
3214,PART VII,"We rise up strong and cast it from the heart,"
3215,PART VII,"And bid it leave us wholly, and depart,"
3216,PART VII,"It does not die, it cannot die; but goes"
3217,PART VII,And mingles with some restless wind that blows
3218,PART VII,About the region where it had its birth.
3219,PART VII,"And though we wander over all the earth,"
3220,PART VII,"That spirit waits, and lingers, year by year,"
3221,PART VII,"Invisible and clothèd like the air,"
3222,PART VII,"Hoping that we may yet again draw near,"
3223,PART VII,"And it may haply take us unaware,"
3224,PART VII,And once more find safe shelter in the breast
3225,PART VII,It stirred of old with pleasure or unrest.
3226,PART VII,
3227,PART VII,"Told by my heart, and wholly positive,"
3228,PART VII,Some old emotion long had ceased to live;
3229,PART VII,"That, were it called, it could not hear or come,"
3230,PART VII,"Because it was so voiceless and so dumb,"
3231,PART VII,"Yet, passing where it first sprang into life,"
3232,PART VII,My very soul has suddenly been rife
3233,PART VII,With all the old intensity of feeling.
3234,PART VII,"It seemed a living spirit, which came stealing"
3235,PART VII,Into my heart from that departed day;
3236,PART VII,"Exiled emotion, which I fancied clay."
3237,PART VII,
3238,PART VII,"So now into my troubled heart, above"
3239,PART VII,"The present’s pain and sorrow, crept the love"
3240,PART VII,"And strife and passion of a bygone hour,"
3241,PART VII,Possessed of all their olden might and power.
3242,PART VII,"’Twas but a moment, and the spell was broken"
3243,PART VII,"By pleasant words of greeting, gently spoken,"
3244,PART VII,And Vivian stood before us.
3245,PART VII,
3246,PART VII,But I saw
3247,PART VII,In him the husband of my friend alone.
3248,PART VII,"The old emotions might at times return,"
3249,PART VII,And smould’ring fires leap up an hour and burn;
3250,PART VII,"But never yet had I transgressed God’s law,"
3251,PART VII,"By looking on the man I had resigned,"
3252,PART VII,"With any hidden feeling in my mind,"
3253,PART VII,"Which she, his wife, my friend, might not have known"
3254,PART VII,He was but little altered.  From his face
3255,PART VII,"The nonchalant and almost haughty grace,"
3256,PART VII,"The lurking laughter waiting in his eyes,"
3257,PART VII,"The years had stolen, leaving in their place"
3258,PART VII,"A settled sadness, which was not despair,"
3259,PART VII,"Nor was it gloom, nor weariness, nor care,"
3260,PART VII,But something like the vapour o’er the skies
3261,PART VII,"Of Indian summer, beautiful to see,"
3262,PART VII,"But spoke of frosts, which had been and would be."
3263,PART VII,"There was that in his face which cometh not,"
3264,PART VII,"Save when the soul has many a battle fought,"
3265,PART VII,And conquered self by constant sacrifice.
3266,PART VII,
3267,PART VII,"There are two sculptors, who, with chisels fine,"
3268,PART VII,Render the plainest features half divine.
3269,PART VII,"All other artists strive and strive in vain,"
3270,PART VII,To picture beauty perfect and complete.
3271,PART VII,"Their statues only crumble at their feet,"
3272,PART VII,Without the master touch of Faith and Pain.
3273,PART VII,"And now his face, that perfect seemed before,"
3274,PART VII,"Chiselled by these two careful artists, wore"
3275,PART VII,"A look exalted, which the spirit gives"
3276,PART VII,"When soul has conquered, and the body lives"
3277,PART VII,Subservient to its bidding.
3278,PART VII,
3279,PART VII,In a room
3280,PART VII,"Which curtained out the February gloom,"
3281,PART VII,"And, redolent with perfume, bright with flowers,"
3282,PART VII,"Rested the eye like one of Summer’s bowers,"
3283,PART VII,"I found my Helen, who was less mine now"
3284,PART VII,Than Death’s; for on the marble of her brow
3285,PART VII,His seal was stamped indelibly.
3286,PART VII,
3287,PART VII,Her form
3288,PART VII,"Was like the slender willow, when some storm"
3289,PART VII,"Has stripped it bare of foliage.  Her face,"
3290,PART VII,"Pale always, now was ghastly in its hue:"
3291,PART VII,"And, like two lamps, in some dark, hollow place,"
3292,PART VII,"Burned her large eyes, grown more intensely blue."
3293,PART VII,"Her fragile hands displayed each cord and vein,"
3294,PART VII,"And on her mouth was that drawn look, of pain"
3295,PART VII,Which is not uttered.  Yet an inward light
3296,PART VII,Shone through and made her wasted features bright
3297,PART VII,With an unearthly beauty; and an awe
3298,PART VII,"Crept o’er me, gazing on her, for I saw"
3299,PART VII,She was so near to Heaven that I seemed
3300,PART VII,To look upon the face of one redeemed.
3301,PART VII,She turned the brilliant lustre of her eyes
3302,PART VII,"Upon me.  She had passed beyond surprise,"
3303,PART VII,Or any strong emotion linked with clay.
3304,PART VII,"But as I glided to her where she lay,"
3305,PART VII,"A smile, celestial in its sweetness, wreathed"
3306,PART VII,Her pallid features.  “Welcome home!” she breathed
3307,PART VII,“Dear hands! dear lips!  I touch you and rejoice.”
3308,PART VII,And like the dying echo of a voice
3309,PART VII,Were her faint tones that thrilled upon my ear.
3310,PART VII,
3311,PART VII,I fell upon my knees beside her bed;
3312,PART VII,"All agonies within my heart were wed,"
3313,PART VII,"While to the aching numbness of my grief,"
3314,PART VII,"Mine eyes refused the solace of a tear,—"
3315,PART VII,The tortured soul’s most merciful relief.
3316,PART VII,Her wasted hand caressed my bended head
3317,PART VII,"For one sad, sacred moment.  Then she said,"
3318,PART VII,"In that low tone so like the wind’s refrain,"
3319,PART VII,"“Maurine, my own! give not away to pain;"
3320,PART VII,The time is precious.  Ere another dawn
3321,PART VII,My soul may hear the summons and pass on.
3322,PART VII,"Arise, sweet sister! rest a little while,"
3323,PART VII,"And when refreshed, come hither.  I grow weak"
3324,PART VII,With every hour that passes.  I must speak
3325,PART VII,And make my dying wishes known to-night.
3326,PART VII,"Go now.”  And in the halo of her smile,"
3327,PART VII,"Which seemed to fill the room with golden light,"
3328,PART VII,I turned and left her.
3329,PART VII,
3330,PART VII,"Later, in the gloom"
3331,PART VII,"Of coming night, I entered that dim room,"
3332,PART VII,And sat down by her.  Vivian held her hand:
3333,PART VII,And on the pillow at her side there smiled
3334,PART VII,The beauteous count’nance of a sleeping child.
3335,PART VII,
3336,PART VII,"“Maurine,” spoke Helen, “for three blissful years,"
3337,PART VII,My heart has dwelt in an enchanted land;
3338,PART VII,"And I have drank the sweetened cup of joy,"
3339,PART VII,Without one drop of anguish or alloy.
3340,PART VII,"And so, ere Pain embitters it with gall,"
3341,PART VII,"Or sad-eyed Sorrow fills it full of tears,"
3342,PART VII,"And bids me quaff, which is the Fate of all"
3343,PART VII,"Who linger long upon this troubled way,"
3344,PART VII,"God takes me to the realm of Endless Day,"
3345,PART VII,"To mingle with His angels, who alone"
3346,PART VII,Can understand such bliss as I have known.
3347,PART VII,"I do not murmur.  God has heaped my measure,"
3348,PART VII,"In three short years, full to the brim with pleasure;"
3349,PART VII,"And, from the fulness of an earthly love,"
3350,PART VII,"I pass to th’ Immortal Arms above,"
3351,PART VII,Before I even brush the skirts of Woe.
3352,PART VII,
3353,PART VII,"“I leave my aged parents here below,"
3354,PART VII,"With none to comfort them.  Maurine, sweet friend!"
3355,PART VII,"Be kind to them, and love them to the end,"
3356,PART VII,Which may not be far distant.
3357,PART VII,
3358,PART VII,And I leave
3359,PART VII,"A soul immortal in your charge, Maurine."
3360,PART VII,"From this most holy, sad and sacred eve,"
3361,PART VII,"Till God shall claim her, she is yours to keep,"
3362,PART VII,"To love and shelter, to protect and guide.”"
3363,PART VII,"She touched the slumb’ring cherub at her side,"
3364,PART VII,"And Vivian gently bore her, still asleep,"
3365,PART VII,And laid the precious burden on my breast.
3366,PART VII,
3367,PART VII,A solemn silence fell upon the scene.
3368,PART VII,"And when the sleeping infant smiled, and pressed"
3369,PART VII,"My yielding bosom with her waxen cheek,"
3370,PART VII,"I felt it would be sacrilege to speak,"
3371,PART VII,Such wordless joy possessed me.
3372,PART VII,
3373,PART VII,Oh! at last
3374,PART VII,"This infant, who, in that tear-blotted past,"
3375,PART VII,"Had caused my soul such travail, was my own:"
3376,PART VII,Through all the lonely coming years to be
3377,PART VII,Mine own to cherish—wholly mine alone.
3378,PART VII,And what I mourned so hopelessly as lost
3379,PART VII,"Was now restored, and given back to me."
3380,PART VII,
3381,PART VII,The dying voice continued:
3382,PART VII,“In this child
3383,PART VII,"You yet have me, whose mortal life she cost."
3384,PART VII,"But all that was most pure and undefiled,"
3385,PART VII,"And good within me, lives in her again."
3386,PART VII,"Maurine, my husband loves me; yet I know,"
3387,PART VII,"Moving about the wide world, to and fro,"
3388,PART VII,"And through, and in the busy haunts of men,"
3389,PART VII,"Not always will his heart be dumb with woe,"
3390,PART VII,But sometime waken to a later love.
3391,PART VII,"Nay, Vivian, hush! my soul has passed above"
3392,PART VII,All selfish feelings!  I would have it so.
3393,PART VII,"While I am with the angels, blest and glad,"
3394,PART VII,"I would not have you sorrowing and sad,"
3395,PART VII,In loneliness go mourning to the end.
3396,PART VII,"But, love!  I could not trust to any other"
3397,PART VII,The sacred office of a foster-mother
3398,PART VII,"To this sweet cherub, save my own heart-friend."
3399,PART VII,
3400,PART VII,"“Teach her to love her father’s name, Maurine,"
3401,PART VII,Where’er he wanders.  Keep my memory green
3402,PART VII,"In her young heart, and lead her in her youth,"
3403,PART VII,To drink from th’ eternal fount of Truth;
3404,PART VII,"Vex her not with sectarian discourse,"
3405,PART VII,Nor strive to teach her piety by force;
3406,PART VII,"Ply not her mind with harsh and narrow creeds,"
3407,PART VII,"Nor frighten her with an avenging God,"
3408,PART VII,Who rules His subjects with a burning rod;
3409,PART VII,But teach her that each mortal simply needs
3410,PART VII,"To grow in hate of hate and love of love,"
3411,PART VII,To gain a kingdom in the courts above.
3412,PART VII,
3413,PART VII,"“Let her be free and natural as the flowers,"
3414,PART VII,That smile and nod throughout the summer hours.
3415,PART VII,"Let her rejoice in all the joys of youth,"
3416,PART VII,But first impress upon her mind this truth:
3417,PART VII,No lasting happiness is e’er attained
3418,PART VII,Save when the heart some _other_ seeks to please.
3419,PART VII,"The cup of selfish pleasures soon is drained,"
3420,PART VII,And full of gall and bitterness the lees.
3421,PART VII,"Next to her God, teach her to love her land;"
3422,PART VII,In her young bosom light the patriot’s flame
3423,PART VII,Until the heart within her shall expand
3424,PART VII,With love and fervour at her country’s name.
3425,PART VII,
3426,PART VII,“No coward-mother bears a valiant son.
3427,PART VII,"And this, my last wish, is an earnest one."
3428,PART VII,
3429,PART VII,"“Maurine, my o’er-taxed strength is waning; you"
3430,PART VII,"Have heard my wishes, and you will be true"
3431,PART VII,"In death as you have been in life, my own!"
3432,PART VII,Now leave me for a little while alone
3433,PART VII,With him—my husband.  Dear love!  I shall rest
3434,PART VII,So sweetly with no care upon my breast.
3435,PART VII,"Good-night, Maurine, come to me in the morning.”"
3436,PART VII,
3437,PART VII,But lo! the Bridegroom with no further warning
3438,PART VII,Came for her at the dawning of the day.
3439,PART VII,"She heard His voice, and smiled, and passed away"
3440,PART VII,Without a struggle.
3441,PART VII,
3442,PART VII,Leaning o’er her bed
3443,PART VII,"To give her greeting, I found but her clay,"
3444,PART VII,And Vivian bowed beside it.
3445,PART VII,
3446,PART VII,"And I said,"
3447,PART VII,"“Dear friend! my soul shall treasure thy request,"
3448,PART VII,And when the night of fever and unrest
3449,PART VII,"Melts in the morning of Eternity,"
3450,PART VII,"Like a freed bird, then I will come to thee."
3451,PART VII,
3452,PART VII,"“I will come to thee in the morning, sweet!"
3453,PART VII,I have been true; and soul with soul shall meet
3454,PART VII,"Before God’s throne, and shall not be afraid."
3455,PART VII,"Thou gav’st me trust, and it was not betrayed."
3456,PART VII,
3457,PART VII,"“I will come to thee in the morning, dear!"
3458,PART VII,The night is dark.  I do not know how near
3459,PART VII,The morn may be of that Eternal Day;
3460,PART VII,I can but keep my faithful watch and pray.
3461,PART VII,
3462,PART VII,"“I will come to thee in the morning, love!"
3463,PART VII,Wait for me on the Eternal Heights above.
3464,PART VII,"The way is troubled where my feet must climb,"
3465,PART VII,Ere I shall tread the mountain-top sublime.
3466,PART VII,
3467,PART VII,"“I will come in the morning, O mine own;"
3468,PART VII,"But for a time must grope my way alone,"
3469,PART VII,"Through tears and sorrow, till the Day shall dawn,"
3470,PART VII,"And I shall hear the summons, and pass on."
3471,PART VII,
3472,PART VII,“I will come in the morning.  Rest secure!
3473,PART VII,My hope is certain and my faith is sure.
3474,PART VII,After the gloom and darkness of the night
3475,PART VII,I will come to thee with the morning light.”
3476,PART VII,
3477,PART VII,* * * * *
3478,PART VII,
3479,PART VII,Three peaceful years slipped silently away.
3480,PART VII,
3481,PART VII,"We dwelt together in my childhood’s home,"
3482,PART VII,"Aunt Ruth and I, and sunny-hearted May."
3483,PART VII,She was a fair and most exquisite child;
3484,PART VII,Her pensive face was delicate and mild
3485,PART VII,Like her dead mother’s; but through her dear eyes
3486,PART VII,"Her father smiled upon me, day by day."
3487,PART VII,"Afar in foreign countries did he roam,"
3488,PART VII,"Now resting under Italy’s blue skies,"
3489,PART VII,And now with Roy in Scotland.
3490,PART VII,
3491,PART VII,And he sent
3492,PART VII,"Brief, friendly letters, telling where he went"
3493,PART VII,"And what he saw, addressed to May or me."
3494,PART VII,And I would write and tell him how she grew—
3495,PART VII,And how she talked about him o’er the sea
3496,PART VII,In her sweet baby fashion; how she knew
3497,PART VII,His picture in the album; how each day
3498,PART VII,She knelt and prayed the blessed Lord would bring
3499,PART VII,Her own papa back to his little May.
3500,PART VII,It was a warm bright morning in the Spring.
3501,PART VII,"I sat in that same sunny portico,"
3502,PART VII,Where I was sitting seven years ago
3503,PART VII,"When Vivian came.  My eyes were full of tears,"
3504,PART VII,As I looked back across the checkered years.
3505,PART VII,How many were the changes they had brought!
3506,PART VII,"Pain, death, and sorrow! but the lesson taught"
3507,PART VII,To my young heart had been of untold worth.
3508,PART VII,I had learned how to “suffer and grow strong”—
3509,PART VII,"That knowledge which best serves us here on earth,"
3510,PART VII,And brings reward in Heaven.
3511,PART VII,
3512,PART VII,Oh! how long
3513,PART VII,The years had been since that June morning when
3514,PART VII,"I heard his step upon the walk, and yet"
3515,PART VII,I seemed to hear its echo still.
3516,PART VII,
3517,PART VII,Just then
3518,PART VII,"Down that same path I turned my eyes, tear-wet,"
3519,PART VII,And lo! the wanderer from a foreign land
3520,PART VII,Stood there before me!—holding out his hand
3521,PART VII,And smiling with those wond’rous eyes of old.
3522,PART VII,
3523,PART VII,"To hide my tears, I ran and brought his child;"
3524,PART VII,"But she was shy, and clung to me, when told"
3525,PART VII,"This was papa, for whom her prayers were said."
3526,PART VII,"She dropped her eyes and shook her little head,"
3527,PART VII,"And would not by his coaxing be beguiled,"
3528,PART VII,Or go to him.
3529,PART VII,
3530,PART VII,"Aunt Ruth was not at home,"
3531,PART VII,"And we two sat and talked, as strangers might,"
3532,PART VII,Of distant countries which we both had seen.
3533,PART VII,But once I thought I saw his large eyes light
3534,PART VII,"With sudden passion, when there came a pause"
3535,PART VII,"In our chit-chat, and then he spoke:"
3536,PART VII,
3537,PART VII,"“Maurine,"
3538,PART VII,I saw a number of your friends in Rome.
3539,PART VII,"We talked of you.  They seemed surprised, because"
3540,PART VII,You were not ’mong the seekers for a name.
3541,PART VII,They thought your whole ambition was for fame.”
3542,PART VII,
3543,PART VII,"“It might have been,” I answered, “when my heart"
3544,PART VII,Had nothing else to fill it.  Now my art
3545,PART VII,Is but a recreation.  I have _this_
3546,PART VII,"To love and live for, which I had not then.”"
3547,PART VII,"And, leaning down, I pressed a tender kiss"
3548,PART VII,Upon my child’s fair brow.
3549,PART VII,
3550,PART VII,"“And yet,” he said,"
3551,PART VII,"The old light leaping to his eyes again,"
3552,PART VII,"“And yet, Maurine, they say you might have wed"
3553,PART VII,A noble Baron! one of many men
3554,PART VII,Who laid their hearts and fortunes at your feet.
3555,PART VII,Why won the bravest of them no return?”
3556,PART VII,"I bowed my head, nor dared his gaze to meet."
3557,PART VII,"On cheek and brow I felt the red blood burn,"
3558,PART VII,And strong emotion strangled speech.
3559,PART VII,
3560,PART VII,He rose
3561,PART VII,And came and knelt beside me.
3562,PART VII,
3563,PART VII,"“Sweet, my sweet!”"
3564,PART VII,"He murmured softly, “God in Heaven knows"
3565,PART VII,How well I loved you seven years ago.
3566,PART VII,"He only knows my anguish, and my grief,"
3567,PART VII,When your own acts forced on me the belief
3568,PART VII,That I had been your plaything and your toy.
3569,PART VII,Yet from his lips I since have learned that Roy
3570,PART VII,Held no place nearer than a friend and brother.
3571,PART VII,"And then a faint suspicion, undefined,"
3572,PART VII,"Of what had been—was—might be, stirred my mind,"
3573,PART VII,"And that great love, I thought died at a blow,"
3574,PART VII,"Rose up within me, strong with hope and life."
3575,PART VII,
3576,PART VII,“Before all heaven and the angel mother
3577,PART VII,"Of this sweet child that slumbers on your heart,"
3578,PART VII,"Maurine, Maurine, I claim you for my wife—"
3579,PART VII,"Mine own, forever, until death shall part!”"
3580,PART VII,
3581,PART VII,"Through happy mists of upward welling tears,"
3582,PART VII,"I leaned, and looked into his beauteous eyes."
3583,PART VII,"“Dear heart,” I said, “if she who dwells above"
3584,PART VII,"Looks down upon us, from yon azure skies,"
3585,PART VII,"She can but bless us, knowing all these years"
3586,PART VII,My soul had yearned in silence for the love
3587,PART VII,"That crowned her life, and left mine own so bleak."
3588,PART VII,"I turned you from me for her fair, frail sake."
3589,PART VII,"For her sweet child’s, and for my own, I take"
3590,PART VII,"You back to be all mine, for evermore.”"
3591,PART VII,
3592,PART VII,Just then the child upon my breast awoke
3593,PART VII,"From her light sleep, and laid her downy cheek"
3594,PART VII,Against her father as he knelt by me.
3595,PART VII,And this unconscious action seemed to be
3596,PART VII,"A silent blessing, which the mother spoke"
3597,PART VII,Gazing upon us from the mystic shore.

4080,“CARLOS”,
4081,“CARLOS”,"Her soft touch on my cheek and forehead sent,"
4082,“CARLOS”,"Like little arrows, thrills of tenderness"
4083,“CARLOS”,Through all my frame.  I trembled with excess
4084,“CARLOS”,"Of love, and sighed the sigh of great content."
4085,“CARLOS”,
4086,“CARLOS”,"When any mortal dares to so rejoice,"
4087,“CARLOS”,"I think a jealous Heaven, bending low,"
4088,“CARLOS”,Reaches a stern hand forth and deals a blow.
4089,“CARLOS”,Sweet through the dusk I heard my lady’s voice.
4090,“CARLOS”,
4091,“CARLOS”,"“My love!” she sighed, “my Carlos!” even now"
4092,“CARLOS”,I feel the perfumed zephyr of her breath
4093,“CARLOS”,"Bearing to me those words of living death,"
4094,“CARLOS”,And starting out the cold drops on my brow.
4095,“CARLOS”,
4096,“CARLOS”,For I am _Paul_—not Carlos!  Who is he
4097,“CARLOS”,"That, in the supreme hour of love’s delight,"
4098,“CARLOS”,"Veiled by the shadows of the falling night,"
4099,“CARLOS”,"She should breathe low his name, forgetting me?"
4100,“CARLOS”,
4101,“CARLOS”,"I will not ask her! ’twere a fruitless task,"
4102,“CARLOS”,"For, woman-like, she would make me believe"
4103,“CARLOS”,"Some well-told tale; and sigh, and seem to grieve,"
4104,“CARLOS”,"And call me cruel.  Nay, I will not ask."
4105,“CARLOS”,
4106,“CARLOS”,"But this man Carlos, whosoe’er he be,"
4107,“CARLOS”,"Has turned my cup of nectar into gall,"
4108,“CARLOS”,Since I know he has claimed some one or all
4109,“CARLOS”,Of these delights my lady grants to me.
4110,“CARLOS”,
4111,“CARLOS”,"He must have knelt and kissed her, in some sad"
4112,“CARLOS”,"And tender twilight, when the day grew dim."
4113,“CARLOS”,How else could I remind her so of him?
4114,“CARLOS”,"Why, reveries like these have made men mad!"
4115,“CARLOS”,
4116,“CARLOS”,He must have felt her soft hand on his brow.
4117,“CARLOS”,"If Heaven were shocked at such presumptuous wrongs,"
4118,“CARLOS”,"And plunged him in the grave, where he belongs,"
4119,“CARLOS”,"_Still she remembers_, though she loves me now."
4120,“CARLOS”,
4121,“CARLOS”,"And if he lives, and meets me to his cost,"
4122,“CARLOS”,"Why, what avails it?  I must hear and see"
4123,“CARLOS”,That curst name “Carlos” always haunting me—
4124,“CARLOS”,So has another Paradise been lost.

4164,THE TWO GLASSES,"Of hands I have cooled, and souls I have saved."

4171,THE TWO GLASSES,"I can tell of the powerful wheel of the mill,"

4497,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Far from the happy haunts of peace and rest.
4498,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Let us stay here in this secluded place
4499,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Made beautiful by love’s endearing grace!
4500,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Love is enough.
4501,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,
4502,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Love is enough.  Why should we strive for power?
4503,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,It brings men only envy and distrust.
4504,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,"The poor world’s homage pleases but an hour,"
4505,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,And earthly honours vanish in the dust.
4506,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,The grandest lives are ofttimes desolate;
4507,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,"Let me be loved, and let who will be great."
4508,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Love is enough.
4509,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,
4510,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Love is enough.  Why should we ask for more?
4511,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,What greater gift have gods vouchsafed to men?
4512,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,What better boon of all their precious store
4513,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Than our fond hearts that love and love again?
4514,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Old love may die; new love is just as sweet;
4515,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,And life is fair and all the world complete:
4516,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,Love is enough!
4517,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,
4518,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,
4519,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,
4520,“LOVE IS ENOUGH”,

4524,LIFE IS LOVE,"Is anyone sad in the world, I wonder?"
4525,LIFE IS LOVE,"Does anyone weep on a day like this,"
4526,LIFE IS LOVE,With the sun above and the green earth under?
4527,LIFE IS LOVE,"Why, what is life but a dream of bliss?"
4528,LIFE IS LOVE,
4529,LIFE IS LOVE,"With the sun and the skies and the birds above me,"
4530,LIFE IS LOVE,Birds that sing as they wheel and fly—
4531,LIFE IS LOVE,With the winds to follow and say they loved me—
4532,LIFE IS LOVE,"Who could be lonely?  O ho, not I!"
4533,LIFE IS LOVE,
4534,LIFE IS LOVE,"Somebody said in the street this morning,"
4535,LIFE IS LOVE,"As I opened my window to let in the light,"
4536,LIFE IS LOVE,That the darkest day of the world was dawning;
4537,LIFE IS LOVE,"But I looked, and the East was a gorgeous sight"
4538,LIFE IS LOVE,
4539,LIFE IS LOVE,One who claims that he knows about it
4540,LIFE IS LOVE,Tells me the Earth is a vale of sin;
4541,LIFE IS LOVE,"But I and the bees and the birds—we doubt it,"
4542,LIFE IS LOVE,And think it a world worth living in.
4543,LIFE IS LOVE,
4544,LIFE IS LOVE,"Someone says that hearts are fickle,"
4545,LIFE IS LOVE,"That love is sorrow, that life is care,"
4546,LIFE IS LOVE,"And the reaper Death, with his shining sickle,"
4547,LIFE IS LOVE,Gathers whatever is bright and fair.
4548,LIFE IS LOVE,
4549,LIFE IS LOVE,"I told the thrush, and we laughed together—"
4550,LIFE IS LOVE,Laughed till the woods were all a-ring;
4551,LIFE IS LOVE,"And he said to me, as he plumed each feather,"
4552,LIFE IS LOVE,"“Well, people must croak, if they cannot sing!”"
4553,LIFE IS LOVE,
4554,LIFE IS LOVE,"Up he flew, but his song, remaining,"
4555,LIFE IS LOVE,"Rang like a bell in my heart all day,"
4556,LIFE IS LOVE,And silenced the voices of weak complaining
4557,LIFE IS LOVE,That pipe like insects along the way.
4558,LIFE IS LOVE,
4559,LIFE IS LOVE,"O world of light, and O world of beauty!"
4560,LIFE IS LOVE,Where are there pleasures so sweet as thine?
4561,LIFE IS LOVE,"Yes, life is love, and love is duty;"
4562,LIFE IS LOVE,"And what heart sorrows?  O no, not mine!"
