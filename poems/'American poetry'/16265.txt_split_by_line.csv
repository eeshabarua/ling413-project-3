110,WE MUST GET HOME,
111,WE MUST GET HOME,
112,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home! How could we stray like this?--
113,WE MUST GET HOME,"So far from home, we know not where it is,--"
114,WE MUST GET HOME,"Only in some fair, apple-blossomy place"
115,WE MUST GET HOME,Of children's faces--and the mother's face--
116,WE MUST GET HOME,"We dimly dream it, till the vision clears"
117,WE MUST GET HOME,"Even in the eyes of fancy, glad with tears."
118,WE MUST GET HOME,
119,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--for we have been away
120,WE MUST GET HOME,"So long, it seems forever and a day!"
121,WE MUST GET HOME,"And O so very homesick we have grown,"
122,WE MUST GET HOME,The laughter of the world is like a moan
123,WE MUST GET HOME,"In our tired hearing, and its song as vain,--"
124,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--we must get home again!
125,WE MUST GET HOME,
126,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home! With heart and soul we yearn
127,WE MUST GET HOME,"To find the long-lost pathway, and return!..."
128,WE MUST GET HOME,The child's shout lifted from the questing band
129,WE MUST GET HOME,"Of old folk, faring weary, hand in hand,"
130,WE MUST GET HOME,"But faces brightening, as if clouds at last"
131,WE MUST GET HOME,Were showering sunshine on us as we passed.
132,WE MUST GET HOME,
133,WE MUST GET HOME,"We must get home: It hurts so staying here,"
134,WE MUST GET HOME,"Where fond hearts must be wept out tear by tear,"
135,WE MUST GET HOME,"And where to wear wet lashes means, at best,"
136,WE MUST GET HOME,"When most our lack, the least our hope of rest--"
137,WE MUST GET HOME,"When most our need of joy, the more our pain--"
138,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--we must get home again!
139,WE MUST GET HOME,
140,WE MUST GET HOME,[Illustration]
141,WE MUST GET HOME,
142,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--home to the simple things--
143,WE MUST GET HOME,The morning-glories twirling up the strings
144,WE MUST GET HOME,"And bugling color, as they blared in blue-"
145,WE MUST GET HOME,And-white o'er garden-gates we scampered through;
146,WE MUST GET HOME,"The long grape-arbor, with its under-shade"
147,WE MUST GET HOME,Blue as the green and purple overlaid.
148,WE MUST GET HOME,
149,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home: All is so quiet there:
150,WE MUST GET HOME,The touch of loving hands on brow and hair--
151,WE MUST GET HOME,"Dim rooms, wherein the sunshine is made mild--"
152,WE MUST GET HOME,The lost love of the mother and the child
153,WE MUST GET HOME,"Restored in restful lullabies of rain,--"
154,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--we must get home again!
155,WE MUST GET HOME,
156,WE MUST GET HOME,The rows of sweetcorn and the China beans
157,WE MUST GET HOME,"Beyond the lettuce-beds where, towering, leans"
158,WE MUST GET HOME,The giant sunflower in barbaric pride
159,WE MUST GET HOME,Guarding the barn-door and the lane outside;
160,WE MUST GET HOME,"The honeysuckles, midst the hollyhocks,"
161,WE MUST GET HOME,That clamber almost to the martin-box.
162,WE MUST GET HOME,
163,WE MUST GET HOME,"We must get home, where, as we nod and drowse,"
164,WE MUST GET HOME,"Time humors us and tiptoes through the house,"
165,WE MUST GET HOME,"And loves us best when sleeping baby-wise,"
166,WE MUST GET HOME,"With dreams--not tear-drops--brimming our clenched eyes,--"
167,WE MUST GET HOME,Pure dreams that know nor taint nor earthly stain--
168,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--we must get home again!
169,WE MUST GET HOME,
170,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home! The willow-whistle's call
171,WE MUST GET HOME,Trills crisp and liquid as the waterfall--
172,WE MUST GET HOME,Mocking the trillers in the cherry-trees
173,WE MUST GET HOME,"And making discord of such rhymes as these,"
174,WE MUST GET HOME,That know nor lilt nor cadence but the birds
175,WE MUST GET HOME,First warbled--then all poets afterwards.
176,WE MUST GET HOME,
177,WE MUST GET HOME,"We must get home; and, unremembering there"
178,WE MUST GET HOME,"All gain of all ambition otherwhere,"
179,WE MUST GET HOME,"Rest--from the feverish victory, and the crown"
180,WE MUST GET HOME,Of conquest whose waste glory weighs us down.--
181,WE MUST GET HOME,Fame's fairest gifts we toss back with disdain--
182,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--we must get home again!
183,WE MUST GET HOME,
184,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home again--we must--we must!--
185,WE MUST GET HOME,(Our rainy faces pelted in the dust)
186,WE MUST GET HOME,Creep back from the vain quest through endless strife
187,WE MUST GET HOME,To find not anywhere in all of life
188,WE MUST GET HOME,A happier happiness than blest us then ...
189,WE MUST GET HOME,We must get home--we must get home again!

642,WHERE-AWAY,Tell us--tell us--where are they?
643,WHERE-AWAY,Through the darkness and the dawn
644,WHERE-AWAY,We have journeyed on and on--
645,WHERE-AWAY,From the cradle to the cross--
646,WHERE-AWAY,From possession unto loss.--
647,WHERE-AWAY,"Seeking still, from day to day,"
648,WHERE-AWAY,For the Lands of Where-Away.
649,WHERE-AWAY,
650,WHERE-AWAY,When our baby-feet were first
651,WHERE-AWAY,"Planted where the daisies burst,"
652,WHERE-AWAY,And the greenest grasses grew
653,WHERE-AWAY,"In the fields we wandered through,--"
654,WHERE-AWAY,"On, with childish discontent,"
655,WHERE-AWAY,"Ever on and on we went,"
656,WHERE-AWAY,"Hoping still to pass, some day,"
657,WHERE-AWAY,O'er the verge of Where-Away.
658,WHERE-AWAY,
659,WHERE-AWAY,Roses laid their velvet lips
660,WHERE-AWAY,"On our own, with fragrant sips;"
661,WHERE-AWAY,"But their kisses held us not,"
662,WHERE-AWAY,All their sweetness we forgot;--
663,WHERE-AWAY,Though the brambles in our track
664,WHERE-AWAY,Plucked at us to hold us back--
665,WHERE-AWAY,"""Just ahead,"" we used to say,"
666,WHERE-AWAY,"""Lie the Lands of Where-Away."""
667,WHERE-AWAY,
668,WHERE-AWAY,"Children at the pasture-bars,"
669,WHERE-AWAY,"Through the dusk, like glimmering stars,"
670,WHERE-AWAY,Waved their hands that we should bide
671,WHERE-AWAY,With them over eventide;
672,WHERE-AWAY,Down the dark their voices failed
673,WHERE-AWAY,"Falteringly, as they hailed,"
674,WHERE-AWAY,And died into yesterday--
675,WHERE-AWAY,Night ahead and--Where-Away?
676,WHERE-AWAY,
677,WHERE-AWAY,Twining arms about us thrown--
678,WHERE-AWAY,"Warm caresses, all our own,"
679,WHERE-AWAY,Can but stay us for a spell--
680,WHERE-AWAY,Love hath little new to tell
681,WHERE-AWAY,"To the soul in need supreme,"
682,WHERE-AWAY,Aching ever with the dream
683,WHERE-AWAY,Of the endless bliss it may
684,WHERE-AWAY,Find in Lands of Where-Away!

832,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,From simple observation.
833,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,
834,NATURAL PERVERSITIES,I notice _little_ things--to wit:--

1180,II,"And, knowing this, as we grasp his hand,"

1184,II,"Else, should we read, ""Though our sins should glow"
1185,II,"As scarlet, they shall be white as snow""?--"

1884,THE RAINY MORNING,Wept in a silent sorrow
1885,THE RAINY MORNING,Where the sweet sunshine lay dead;
1886,THE RAINY MORNING,And a wind came out of the eastward
1887,THE RAINY MORNING,"Like an endless sigh of pain,"
1888,THE RAINY MORNING,And the leaves fell down in the pathway
1889,THE RAINY MORNING,And writhed in the falling rain.
1890,THE RAINY MORNING,
1891,THE RAINY MORNING,I had tried in a brave endeavor
1892,THE RAINY MORNING,"To chord my harp with the sun,"
1893,THE RAINY MORNING,"But the strings would slacken ever,"
1894,THE RAINY MORNING,And the task was a weary one:
1895,THE RAINY MORNING,"And so, like a child impatient"
1896,THE RAINY MORNING,"And sick of a discontent,"
1897,THE RAINY MORNING,I bowed in a shower of teardrops
1898,THE RAINY MORNING,And mourned with the instrument.
1899,THE RAINY MORNING,
1900,THE RAINY MORNING,"And lo! as I bowed, the splendor"
1901,THE RAINY MORNING,"Of the sun bent over me,"
1902,THE RAINY MORNING,With a touch as warm and tender
1903,THE RAINY MORNING,As a father's hand might be:
1904,THE RAINY MORNING,"And even as I felt its presence,"
1905,THE RAINY MORNING,"My clouded soul grew bright,"
1906,THE RAINY MORNING,"And the tears, like the rain of morning,"
1907,THE RAINY MORNING,Melted in mists of light.

2053,A BACKWARD LOOK,Wandering ever with tireless feet
2054,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Through scenes of silence, and jubilee"
2055,A BACKWARD LOOK,Of long-hushed voices; and faces sweet
2056,A BACKWARD LOOK,Were thronging the shadowy side of the street
2057,A BACKWARD LOOK,As far as the eye could see;
2058,A BACKWARD LOOK,"Dreaming again, in anticipation,"

2144,THE OLD GUITAR,"That the dull dust hides away,"

2148,THE OLD GUITAR,The keys hold only nerveless strings--
2149,THE OLD GUITAR,The sinews of brave old airs

2151,THE OLD GUITAR,So closely here declares
2152,THE OLD GUITAR,A sad regret in its ravelings
2153,THE OLD GUITAR,And the faded hue it wears.
2154,THE OLD GUITAR,
2155,THE OLD GUITAR,"But the old guitar, with a lenient grace,"
2156,THE OLD GUITAR,Has cherished a smile for me;
2157,THE OLD GUITAR,And its features hint of a fairer face
2158,THE OLD GUITAR,That comes with a memory
2159,THE OLD GUITAR,Of a flower-and-perfume-haunted place
2160,THE OLD GUITAR,And a moonlit balcony.
2161,THE OLD GUITAR,
2162,THE OLD GUITAR,Music sweeter than words confess
2163,THE OLD GUITAR,"Or the minstrel's powers invent,"
2164,THE OLD GUITAR,Thrilled here once at the light caress
2165,THE OLD GUITAR,Of the fairy hands that lent
2166,THE OLD GUITAR,This excuse for the kiss I press
2167,THE OLD GUITAR,On the dear old instrument.
2168,THE OLD GUITAR,
2169,THE OLD GUITAR,The rose of pearl with the jeweled stem
2170,THE OLD GUITAR,Still blooms; and the tiny sets
2171,THE OLD GUITAR,In the circle all are here; the gem
2172,THE OLD GUITAR,"In the keys, and the silver frets;"

2176,THE OLD GUITAR,"Alas for the loosened strings to-day,"
