128,TO R. K.[1],Bard of the fighting man!
129,TO R. K.[1],"You have made us kneel to a God of Steel,"
130,TO R. K.[1],And to fear his church's ban;
131,TO R. K.[1],You have taught the song that the bullet sings—
132,TO R. K.[1],The knell and the crowning ode of kings;

136,TO R. K.[1],Bard of our grim machines!
137,TO R. K.[1],"You have made us dream of a God of Steam,"

144,TO R. K.[1],Singer of those who bow
145,TO R. K.[1],To the earthen clods that they call their gods
146,TO R. K.[1],And with god-like fees endow;
147,TO R. K.[1],"You have shown that these heed not the suppliant's plea,"
148,TO R. K.[1],"Nor the prayers of the priest and devotee,"
149,TO R. K.[1],Nor the vestal's futile vow.
150,TO R. K.[1],
151,TO R. K.[1],"Singer, we ask what we cannot learn"
152,TO R. K.[1],From our wise men and our schools;
153,TO R. K.[1],Will our offered slain from our gods obtain

155,TO R. K.[1],Will our man-made gods be like their kind?
156,TO R. K.[1],If we bow to a clod of clay enshrined
157,TO R. K.[1],Will we pray our prayers in vain?

213,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Between the tangle of the palms,"
214,THE SPANISH MAIN,"There gleaming, like a star-strewn plain,"
215,THE SPANISH MAIN,"All smiling, lies the sea of calms,"
216,THE SPANISH MAIN,And calls to us to fare amain;
217,THE SPANISH MAIN,"And calls us, as with smile and gem,"
218,THE SPANISH MAIN,"She called that bold, upstanding brood,"
219,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Whose bones, when she had done with them,"
220,THE SPANISH MAIN,Upon her shores she strewed.
221,THE SPANISH MAIN,
222,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Between the tangle of the palms,"
223,THE SPANISH MAIN,"By day the gleam is on the swell,"
224,THE SPANISH MAIN,"And drifting zephyrs, bearing balms,"
225,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Her tales of joy and riches tell,"
226,THE SPANISH MAIN,And when the winds of night are free
227,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Long, glimmering ripples wander by"
228,THE SPANISH MAIN,"As if the stars where in the sea,"
229,THE SPANISH MAIN,Instead of in the sky.
230,THE SPANISH MAIN,
231,THE SPANISH MAIN,And they went forth in ships of war
232,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Girt up in all foolhardiness,"
233,THE SPANISH MAIN,"To take their toll from out her store,"
234,THE SPANISH MAIN,Beguiled and snared by her caress;
235,THE SPANISH MAIN,And we go forth in cargo ships
236,THE SPANISH MAIN,"To wrest her treasures bloodlessly,"
237,THE SPANISH MAIN,"And buy the nectar from her lips,"
238,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Our fairy goddess, she!"
239,THE SPANISH MAIN,
240,THE SPANISH MAIN,Where once their galleons blundered by
241,THE SPANISH MAIN,"Our cargo ships are on their way,"
242,THE SPANISH MAIN,"And where their galleons rotting lie,"
243,THE SPANISH MAIN,Our cargo ships are wrecked today.
244,THE SPANISH MAIN,"For ever, 'till the world is done,"
245,THE SPANISH MAIN,"And all good merchantmen go down,"
246,THE SPANISH MAIN,"And dies the wind, as pales the sun,"
247,THE SPANISH MAIN,Her smile will mask her frown.

258,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],With a thousand rookies sweatin' in her hold;
259,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' the sergeants drove an' drilled them, an' the sun it nearly killed"
260,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"them,—"
261,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],Till they learned to do whatever they were told.
262,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
263,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she lay at Honolu',"
264,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' the rookies went ashore an' roughed the town,"
265,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"So the sergeants they corralled them, and with butt and barrel quelled"
266,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"them,—"
267,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],An' they limped aboard an' set to fryin' brown.
268,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
269,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she steamed to-ward the south,"
270,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"And the rookies sweated morning, noon and night;"
271,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"'Till the lookout sighted land, and they cheered each grain o' sand,—"
272,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],For their blood was boilin' over for a fight.
273,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
274,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she tied up at the dock,"
275,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' each rookie lugged his gun an' kit ashore,"
276,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' a train it come and took 'em where the tropic sun could cook 'em,—"
277,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],An' the sergeants they could talk to them of war.
278,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
279,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she had her bottom scraped,"
280,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"For the first part of her labor it was done,"
281,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' the rookies chased the Tagals and the Tagals they escaped,—"
282,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],An' the rookies set and sweated in the sun.
283,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
284,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
285,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she loafed around awhile,"
286,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' the rookies they was soldier boys by now,"
287,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],For it don't take long to teach 'em—where the Tagal lead can reach
288,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],'em—
289,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],All about the which and why and when and how.
290,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
291,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she headed home again,"
292,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],With a thousand heavy coffins in her hold;
293,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"They were soldered up and stenciled, they were numbered and blue"
294,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"penciled,—"
295,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],And the rookies lay inside 'em stiff and cold.
296,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
297,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she reached the Golden Gate,"
298,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],An' the derrick dumped her cargo on the shore;
299,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"In a pyramid they piled it—and her manifest they filed it,"
300,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],In a pigeon-hole with half a hundred more.
301,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
302,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she travels up and down,"
303,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],A-haulin' rookies to and from the war;
304,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],Outward-bound they sweat in Kharki; homeward bound they come in lead
305,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],And they wonder what they've got to do it for.
306,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],
307,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"The transport Gen'ral Ferguson, she's owned by Uncle Sam,"
308,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"An' maybe Uncle Sam could tell 'em why,"
309,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],"But he don't—and so he takes 'em out to fight, and sweat, and swear,"
310,THE TRANSPORT GEN'RAL FERGUSON[2],An' brings them home for plantin' when they die.

1213,IL PENSEROSO,
1214,IL PENSEROSO,
1215,IL PENSEROSO,Love's song is sung in ragtime now
1216,IL PENSEROSO,"And kisses sweet are syncopated joys,"
1217,IL PENSEROSO,"The tender sign, the melancholy moan,"
1218,IL PENSEROSO,The soft reproach and yearning up-turned gaze
1219,IL PENSEROSO,Have passed into the caves without the gates
1220,IL PENSEROSO,"And in their place, to serve love's purposes,"
1221,IL PENSEROSO,Bold profanations from the music halls
1222,IL PENSEROSO,Are working overtime.
1223,IL PENSEROSO,
1224,IL PENSEROSO,In days of old the amorous swain would sigh
1225,IL PENSEROSO,And say unto his lady love the while
1226,IL PENSEROSO,"He pressed her to his heaving low-cut vest,"
1227,IL PENSEROSO,"“Dost love me, sweet?” And she, with many a blush,"
1228,IL PENSEROSO,"Would softly answer, “Yes, my cavalier!”"
1229,IL PENSEROSO,"Now to his girl the ragtime lover says,"
1230,IL PENSEROSO,The while he strums his marked-down mandolin
1231,IL PENSEROSO,"“Is you ma lady love?” and she, his girl,"
1232,IL PENSEROSO,Makes answer thus: “Ah is!”
1233,IL PENSEROSO,
1234,IL PENSEROSO,Gadzooks! it makes me sad! I see the doom
1235,IL PENSEROSO,"Of Cupid, and upon the battered air"
1236,IL PENSEROSO,I hear a rumor floating. It is this:
1237,IL PENSEROSO,That when the boy god shuffles to the grave
1238,IL PENSEROSO,'Tis Syncopated Sambo that will get
1239,IL PENSEROSO,His job!
1240,IL PENSEROSO,
1241,IL PENSEROSO,*       *       *       *       *
1242,IL PENSEROSO,
1243,IL PENSEROSO,"Ah, me! What sadness resteth on my soul!"

1250,FINIS,
1251,FINIS,There was a man that delved in the earth
1252,FINIS,"For glittering gems and gold,"
1253,FINIS,And whatever lay hidden that seemed of worth
1254,FINIS,He carefully seized and sold;
1255,FINIS,"So his days were long and his store was great,"
1256,FINIS,"And ever for more he sighed,"
1257,FINIS,'Till kings bowed down and he ruled in state—
1258,FINIS,And after awhile he died.
1259,FINIS,
1260,FINIS,"_Oh, blithesome and shrill the wails resound!"
1261,FINIS,"Oh, gaily his children moan!"
1262,FINIS,And the end of it all was a hole in the ground
1263,FINIS,And a scratch on a crumbling stone._
1264,FINIS,
1265,FINIS,"There was a man that fought for the right,"
1266,FINIS,"And never a friend had he,"
1267,FINIS,'Till after the dark there dawned the light
1268,FINIS,And the world could know and see;
1269,FINIS,"Oh, long was the fight and comfortless,"
1270,FINIS,"But great was the fighter's pride,"
1271,FINIS,And a victor he rose from the storm and stress—
1272,FINIS,And after awhile he died.
1273,FINIS,
1274,FINIS,"_Oh, great was the fame but newly found"
1275,FINIS,Of the man that fought alone!
1276,FINIS,And the end of it all was a hole in the ground
1277,FINIS,And a scratch on a crumbling stone._
1278,FINIS,
1279,FINIS,"There was a man that dreamed a dream,"
1280,FINIS,And his pen it served his brain;
1281,FINIS,And great was his art and great his theme
1282,FINIS,And long was his laurelled reign;
1283,FINIS,But after awhile the world forgot
1284,FINIS,"And his work was pushed aside,"
1285,FINIS,(For to serve and wait is the mortal lot)
1286,FINIS,"And then, in the end, he died."
1287,FINIS,
1288,FINIS,_Oh! brown on his brow were the bays that bound
1289,FINIS,And far was his glory flown!
1290,FINIS,And the end of it all was a hole in the ground
1291,FINIS,And a scratch on a crumbling stone._
