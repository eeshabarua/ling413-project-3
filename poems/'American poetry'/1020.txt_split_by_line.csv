55,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Preface
56,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
57,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
58,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
59,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"No one expects a man to make a chair without first learning how, but"
60,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"there is a popular impression that the poet is born, not made, and that"
61,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,his verses burst from his overflowing heart of themselves. As a matter
62,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"of fact, the poet must learn his trade in the same manner, and with the"
63,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"same painstaking care, as the cabinet-maker. His heart may overflow with"
64,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"high thoughts and sparkling fancies, but if he cannot convey them to his"
65,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,reader by means of the written word he has no claim to be considered a
66,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"poet.  A workman may be pardoned, therefore, for spending a few moments"
67,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,to explain and describe the technique of his trade.  A work of beauty
68,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,which cannot stand an intimate examination is a poor and jerry-built
69,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,thing.
70,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
71,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"In the first place, I wish to state my firm belief that poetry should"
72,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"not try to teach, that it should exist simply because it is a created"
73,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"beauty, even if sometimes the beauty of a gothic grotesque.  We do not"
74,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"ask the trees to teach us moral lessons, and only the Salvation Army"
75,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,feels it necessary to pin texts upon them.  We know that these texts are
76,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"ridiculous, but many of us do not yet see that to write an obvious moral"
77,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"all over a work of art, picture, statue, or poem, is not only"
78,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"ridiculous, but timid and vulgar.  We distrust a beauty we only half"
79,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"understand, and rush in with our impertinent suggestions.  How far we"
80,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"are from ""admitting the Universe""!  The Universe, which flings down its"
81,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"continents and seas, and leaves them without comment.  Art is as much a"
82,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"function of the Universe as an Equinoctial gale, or the Law of"
83,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Gravitation; and we insist upon considering it merely a little
84,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"scroll-work, of no great importance unless it be studded with nails"
85,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,from which pretty and uplifting sentiments may be hung!
86,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
87,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,For the purely technical side I must state my immense debt to the
88,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"French, and perhaps above all to the, so-called, Parnassian School,"
89,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,although some of the writers who have influenced me most do not belong
90,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"to it. High-minded and untiring workmen, they have spared no pains to"
91,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,produce a poetry finer than that of any other country in our time.
92,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Poetry so full of beauty and feeling, that the study of it is at once an"
93,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,inspiration and a despair to the artist.  The Anglo-Saxon of our day has
94,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,a tendency to think that a fine idea excuses slovenly workmanship. These
95,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,clear-eyed Frenchmen are a reproof to our self-satisfied laziness.
96,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Before the works of Parnassians like Leconte de Lisle, and José-Maria de"
97,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Heredia, or those of Henri de Régnier, Albert Samain, Francis Jammes,"
98,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Remy de Gourmont, and Paul Fort, of the more modern school, we stand"
99,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"rebuked.  Indeed--""They order this matter better in France."""
100,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
101,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"It is because in France, to-day, poetry is so living and vigorous a"
102,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"thing, that so many metrical experiments come from there.  Only a"
103,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,vigorous tree has the vitality to put forth new branches.  The poet with
104,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,originality and power is always seeking to give his readers the same
105,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,poignant feeling which he has himself.  To do this he must constantly
106,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"find new and striking images, delightful and unexpected forms.  Take the"
107,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"word ""daybreak"", for instance. What a remarkable picture it must once"
108,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"have conjured up! The great, round sun, like the yolk of some mighty"
109,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"egg, BREAKING through cracked and splintered clouds.  But we have said"
110,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""daybreak"" so often that we do not see the picture any more, it has"
111,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,become only another word for dawn.  The poet must be constantly seeking
112,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,new pictures to make his readers feel the vitality of his thought.
113,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
114,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Many of the poems in this volume are written in what the French call
115,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Vers Libre"", a nomenclature more suited to French use and to French"
116,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"versification than to ours.  I prefer to call them poems in ""unrhymed"
117,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"cadence"", for that conveys their exact meaning to an English ear.  They"
118,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"are built upon ""organic rhythm"", or the rhythm of the speaking voice"
119,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"with its necessity for breathing, rather than upon a strict metrical"
120,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"system.  They differ from ordinary prose rhythms by being more curved,"
121,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"and containing more stress. The stress, and exceedingly marked curve, of"
122,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"any regular metre is easily perceived.  These poems, built upon cadence,"
123,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"are more subtle, but the laws they follow are not less fixed.  Merely"
124,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"chopping prose lines into lengths does not produce cadence, it is"
125,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,constructed upon mathematical and absolute laws of balance and time.  In
126,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"the preface to his ""Poems"", Henley speaks of ""those unrhyming rhythms in"
127,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"which I had tried to quintessentialize, as (I believe) one scarce can do"
128,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"in rhyme."" The desire to ""quintessentialize"", to head-up an emotion"
129,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"until it burns white-hot, seems to be an integral part of the modern"
130,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"temper, and certainly ""unrhymed cadence"" is unique in its power of"
131,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,expressing this.
132,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
133,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Three of these poems are written in a form which, so far as I know, has"
134,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"never before been attempted in English.  M. Paul Fort is its inventor,"
135,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,and the results it has yielded to him are most beautiful and
136,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,satisfactory. Perhaps it is more suited to the French language than to
137,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,English. But I found it the only medium in which these particular poems
138,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"could be written.  It is a fluid and changing form, now prose, now"
139,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"verse, and permitting a great variety of treatment."
140,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
141,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,But the reader will see that I have not entirely abandoned the more
142,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"classic English metres.  I cannot see why, because certain manners suit"
143,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"certain emotions and subjects, it should be considered imperative for an"
144,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,author to employ no others.  Schools are for those who can confine
145,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,themselves within them.  Perhaps it is a weakness in me that I cannot.
146,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
147,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"In conclusion, I would say that these remarks are in answer to many"
148,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,questions asked me by people who have happened to read some of these
149,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,poems in periodicals.  They are not for the purpose of forestalling
150,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"criticism, nor of courting it; and they deal, as I said in the"
151,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"beginning, solely with the question of technique.  For the more"
152,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"important part of the book, the poems must speak for themselves."

233,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
234,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
235,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A drifting, April, twilight sky,"
236,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A wind which blew the puddles dry,"
237,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And slapped the river into waves
238,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,That ran and hid among the staves
239,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of an old wharf.  A watery light
240,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Touched bleak the granite bridge, and white"
241,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Without the slightest tinge of gold,"
242,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The city shivered in the cold.
243,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"All day my thoughts had lain as dead,"
244,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Unborn and bursting in my head.
245,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,From time to time I wrote a word
246,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Which lines and circles overscored.
247,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My table seemed a graveyard, full"
248,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of coffins waiting burial.
249,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I seized these vile abortions, tore"
250,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Them into jagged bits, and swore"
251,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,To be the dupe of hope no more.
252,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Into the evening straight I went,"
253,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Starved of a day's accomplishment.
254,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Unnoticing, I wandered where"
255,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The city gave a space for air,"
256,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And on the bridge's parapet
257,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I leant, while pallidly there set"
258,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A dim, discouraged, worn-out sun."
259,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Behind me, where the tramways run,"
260,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Blossomed bright lights, I turned to leave,"
261,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,When someone plucked me by the sleeve.
262,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Your pardon, Sir, but I should be"
263,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Most grateful could you lend to me
264,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A carfare, I have lost my purse."""
265,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The voice was clear, concise, and terse."
266,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I turned and met the quiet gaze
267,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of strange eyes flashing through the haze.
268,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
269,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The man was old and slightly bent,"
270,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Under his cloak some instrument
271,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Disarranged its stately line,"
272,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He rested on his cane a fine
273,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And nervous hand, an almandine"
274,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Smouldered with dull-red flames, sanguine"
275,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"It burned in twisted gold, upon"
276,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"His finger.  Like some Spanish don,"
277,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Conferring favours even when
278,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Asking an alms, he bowed again"
279,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And waited.  But my pockets proved
280,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Empty, in vain I poked and shoved,"
281,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,No hidden penny lurking there
282,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Greeted my search.  ""Sir, I declare"
283,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I have no money, pray forgive,"
284,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"But let me take you where you live."""
285,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And so we plodded through the mire
286,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Where street lamps cast a wavering fire.
287,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I took no note of where we went,"
288,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,His talk became the element
289,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Wherein my being swam, content."
290,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,It flashed like rapiers in the night
291,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Lit by uncertain candle-light,"
292,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,When on some moon-forsaken sward
293,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,A quarrel dies upon a sword.
294,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"It hacked and carved like a cutlass blade,"
295,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And the noise in the air the broad words made
296,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Was the cry of the wind at a window-pane
297,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,On an Autumn night of sobbing rain.
298,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Then it would run like a steady stream
299,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Under pinnacled bridges where minarets gleam,"
300,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Or lap the air like the lapping tide
301,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Where a marble staircase lifts its wide
302,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Green-spotted steps to a garden gate,"
303,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And a waning moon is sinking straight
304,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Down to a black and ominous sea,"
305,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,While a nightingale sings in a lemon tree.
306,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
307,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I walked as though some opiate
308,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Had stung and dulled my brain, a state"
309,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Acute and slumbrous.  It grew late.
310,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"We stopped, a house stood silent, dark."
311,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The old man scratched a match, the spark"
312,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Lit up the keyhole of a door,"
313,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,We entered straight upon a floor
314,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,White with finest powdered sand
315,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Carefully sifted, one might stand"
316,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Muddy and dripping, and yet no trace"
317,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Would stain the boards of this kitchen-place.
318,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"From the chimney, red eyes sparked the gloom,"
319,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And a cricket's chirp filled all the room.
320,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,My host threw pine-cones on the fire
321,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre
322,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Wrapped in the golden flame's desire.
323,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The chamber opened like an eye,"
324,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,As a half-melted cloud in a Summer sky
325,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The soul of the house stood guessed, and shy"
326,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,It peered at the stranger warily.
327,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,A little shop with its various ware
328,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Spread on shelves with nicest care.
329,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Pitchers, and jars, and jugs, and pots,"
330,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Pipkins, and mugs, and many lots"
331,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of lacquered canisters, black and gold,"
332,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Like those in which Chinese tea is sold.
333,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Chests, and puncheons, kegs, and flasks,"
334,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Goblets, chalices, firkins, and casks."
335,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,In a corner three ancient amphorae leaned
336,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Against the wall, like ships careened."
337,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"There was dusky blue of Wedgewood ware,"
338,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The carved, white figures fluttering there"
339,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Like leaves adrift upon the air.
340,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Classic in touch, but emasculate,"
341,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The Greek soul grown effeminate.
342,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The factory of Sevres had lent
343,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Elegant boxes with ornament
344,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Culled from gardens where fountains splashed
345,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And golden carp in the shadows flashed,"
346,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Nuzzling for crumbs under lily-pads,"
347,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Which ladies threw as the last of fads.
348,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt,"
349,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Hand on heart, and daintily spelt"
350,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Their love in flowers, brittle and bright,"
351,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Artificial and fragile, which told aright"
352,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The vows of an eighteenth-century knight.
353,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The cruder tones of old Dutch jugs
354,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Glared from one shelf, where Toby mugs"
355,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Endlessly drank the foaming ale,"
356,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Its froth grown dusty, awaiting sale."
357,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The glancing light of the burning wood
358,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Played over a group of jars which stood
359,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"On a distant shelf, it seemed the sky"
360,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Had lent the half-tones of his blazonry
361,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,To paint these porcelains with unknown hues
362,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of reds dyed purple and greens turned blues,"
363,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of lustres with so evanescent a sheen
364,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Their colours are felt, but never seen."
365,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Strange winged dragons writhe about
366,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"These vases, poisoned venoms spout,"
367,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Impregnate with old Chinese charms;
368,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Sealed urns containing mortal harms,"
369,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"They fill the mind with thoughts impure,"
370,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Pestilent drippings from the ure
371,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of vicious thinkings.  ""Ah, I see,"""
372,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Said I, ""you deal in pottery."""
373,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The old man turned and looked at me.
374,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Shook his head gently.  ""No,"" said he."
375,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
376,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Then from under his cloak he took the thing
377,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Which I had wondered to see him bring
378,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Guarded so carefully from sight.
379,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"As he laid it down it flashed in the light,"
380,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A Toledo blade, with basket hilt,"
381,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Damascened with arabesques of gilt,"
382,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Or rather gold, and tempered so"
383,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,It could cut a floating thread at a blow.
384,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The old man smiled, ""It has no sheath,"
385,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,'Twas a little careless to have it beneath
386,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My cloak, for a jostle to my arm"
387,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Would have resulted in serious harm.
388,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"But it was so fine, I could not wait,"
389,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"So I brought it with me despite its state."""
390,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""An amateur of arms,"" I thought,"
391,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Bringing home a prize which he has bought."""
392,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""You care for this sort of thing, Dear Sir?"""
393,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Not in the way which you infer."
394,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I need them in business, that is all."""
395,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And he pointed his finger at the wall.
396,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Then I saw what I had not noticed before.
397,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The walls were hung with at least five score
398,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of swords and daggers of every size
399,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Which nations of militant men could devise.
400,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Poisoned spears from tropic seas,"
401,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"That natives, under banana trees,"
402,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Smear with the juice of some deadly snake.
403,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Blood-dipped arrows, which savages make"
404,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And tip with feathers, orange and green,"
405,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A quivering death, in harlequin sheen."
406,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"High up, a fan of glancing steel"
407,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Was formed of claymores in a wheel.
408,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Jewelled swords worn at kings' levees
409,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Were suspended next midshipmen's dirks, and these"
410,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Elbowed stilettos come from Spain,"
411,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Chased with some splendid Hidalgo's name.
412,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"There were Samurai swords from old Japan,"
413,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And scimitars from Hindoostan,"
414,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,While the blade of a Turkish yataghan
415,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Made a waving streak of vitreous white
416,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Upon the wall, in the firelight."
417,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Foils with buttons broken or lost
418,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Lay heaped on a chair, among them tossed"
419,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The boarding-pike of a privateer.
420,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Against the chimney leaned a queer
421,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Two-handed weapon, with edges dull"
422,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,As though from hacking on a skull.
423,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The rusted blood corroded it still.
424,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,My host took up a paper spill
425,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"From a heap which lay in an earthen bowl,"
426,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And lighted it at a burning coal.
427,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"At either end of the table, tall"
428,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Wax candles were placed, each in a small,"
429,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And slim, and burnished candlestick"
430,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of pewter.  The old man lit each wick,"
431,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And the room leapt more obviously
432,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Upon my mind, and I could see"
433,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,What the flickering fire had hid from me.
434,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Above the chimney's yawning throat,"
435,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Shoulder high, like the dark wainscote,"
436,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Was a mantelshelf of polished oak
437,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Blackened with the pungent smoke
438,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of firelit nights; a Cromwell clock
439,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of tarnished brass stood like a rock
440,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"In the midst of a heaving, turbulent sea"
441,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of every sort of cutlery.
442,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"There lay knives sharpened to any use,"
443,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The keenest lancet, and the obtuse"
444,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And blunted pruning bill-hook; blades
445,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of razors, scalpels, shears; cascades"
446,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of penknives, with handles of mother-of-pearl,"
447,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And scythes, and sickles, and scissors; a whirl"
448,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of points and edges, and underneath"
449,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Shot the gleam of a saw with bristling teeth.
450,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My head grew dizzy, I seemed to hear"
451,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A battle-cry from somewhere near,"
452,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The clash of arms, and the squeal of balls,"
453,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And the echoless thud when a dead man falls.
454,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A smoky cloud had veiled the room,"
455,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Shot through with lurid glares; the gloom
456,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Pounded with shouts and dying groans,"
457,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"With the drip of blood on cold, hard stones."
458,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Sabres and lances in streaks of light
459,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Gleamed through the smoke, and at my right"
460,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A creese, like a licking serpent's tongue,"
461,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Glittered an instant, while it stung."
462,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Streams, and points, and lines of fire!"
463,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The livid steel, which man's desire"
464,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Had forged and welded, burned white and cold."
465,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Every blade which man could mould,"
466,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Which could cut, or slash, or cleave, or rip,"
467,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Or pierce, or thrust, or carve, or strip,"
468,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Or gash, or chop, or puncture, or tear,"
469,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Or slice, or hack, they all were there."
470,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Nerveless and shaking, round and round,"
471,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I stared at the walls and at the ground,"
472,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Till the room spun like a whipping top,"
473,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And a stern voice in my ear said, ""Stop!"
474,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I sell no tools for murderers here.
475,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of what are you thinking!  Please clear
476,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Your mind of such imaginings.
477,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Sit down.  I will tell you of these things."""
478,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
479,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He pushed me into a great chair
480,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of russet leather, poked a flare"
481,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of tumbling flame, with the old long sword,"
482,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Up the chimney; but said no word.
483,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Slowly he walked to a distant shelf,"
484,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And brought back a crock of finest delf.
485,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He rested a moment a blue-veined hand
486,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Upon the cover, then cut a band"
487,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of paper, pasted neatly round,"
488,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Opened and poured.  A sliding sound
489,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Came from beneath his old white hands,"
490,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And I saw a little heap of sands,"
491,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Black and smooth.  What could they be:
492,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Pepper,"" I thought.  He looked at me."
493,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""What you see is poppy seed."
494,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Lethean dreams for those in need."""
495,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He took up the grains with a gentle hand
496,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And sifted them slowly like hour-glass sand.
497,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,On his old white finger the almandine
498,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Shot out its rays, incarnadine."
499,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Visions for those too tired to sleep."
500,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,These seeds cast a film over eyes which weep.
501,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"No single soul in the world could dwell,"
502,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Without these poppy-seeds I sell."""
503,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"For a moment he played with the shining stuff,"
504,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Passing it through his fingers.  Enough
505,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"At last, he poured it back into"
506,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The china jar of Holland blue,"
507,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Which he carefully carried to its place.
508,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Then, with a smile on his aged face,"
509,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He drew up a chair to the open space
510,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"'Twixt table and chimney.  ""Without preface,"
511,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Young man, I will say that what you see"
512,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Is not the puzzle you take it to be."""
513,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""But surely, Sir, there is something strange"
514,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,In a shop with goods at so wide a range
515,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Each from the other, as swords and seeds."
516,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Your neighbours must have greatly differing needs."""
517,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""My neighbours,"" he said, and he stroked his chin,"
518,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Live everywhere from here to Pekin."
519,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"But you are wrong, my sort of goods"
520,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Is but one thing in all its moods."""
521,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He took a shagreen letter case
522,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"From his pocket, and with charming grace"
523,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Offered me a printed card.
524,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I read the legend, ""Ephraim Bard."
525,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Dealer in Words.""  And that was all."
526,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I stared at the letters, whimsical"
527,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Indeed, or was it merely a jest."
528,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He answered my unasked request:
529,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""All books are either dreams or swords,"
530,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"You can cut, or you can drug, with words."
531,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My firm is a very ancient house,"
532,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The entries on my books would rouse
533,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Your wonder, perhaps incredulity."
534,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I inherited from an ancestry
535,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Stretching remotely back and far,"
536,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"This business, and my clients are"
537,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"As were those of my grandfather's days,"
538,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Writers of books, and poems, and plays."
539,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My swords are tempered for every speech,"
540,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"For fencing wit, or to carve a breach"
541,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Through old abuses the world condones.
542,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"In another room are my grindstones and hones,"
543,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,For whetting razors and putting a point
544,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"On daggers, sometimes I even anoint"
545,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The blades with a subtle poison, so"
546,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,A twofold result may follow the blow.
547,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,These are purchased by men who feel
548,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The need of stabbing society's heel,"
549,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Which egotism has brought them to think
550,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Is set on their necks.  I have foils to pink
551,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"An adversary to quaint reply,"
552,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And I have customers who buy
553,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Scalpels with which to dissect the brains
554,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And hearts of men.  Ultramundanes
555,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Even demand some finer kinds
556,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,To open their own souls and minds.
557,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,But the other half of my business deals
558,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"With visions and fancies.  Under seals,"
559,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Sorted, and placed in vessels here,"
560,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I keep the seeds of an atmosphere.
561,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Each jar contains a different kind
562,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Of poppy seed.  From farthest Ind
563,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Come the purple flowers, opium filled,"
564,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,From which the weirdest myths are distilled;
565,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,My orient porcelains contain them all.
566,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Those Lowestoft pitchers against the wall
567,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Hold a lighter kind of bright conceit;
568,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And those old Saxe vases, out of the heat"
569,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"On that lowest shelf beside the door,"
570,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Have a sort of Ideal, ""couleur d'or""."
571,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Every castle of the air
572,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Sleeps in the fine black grains, and there"
573,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Are seeds for every romance, or light"
574,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Whiff of a dream for a summer night.
575,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I supply to every want and taste."""
576,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"'Twas slowly said, in no great haste"
577,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He seemed to push his wares, but I"
578,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Dumfounded listened.  By and by
579,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,A log on the fire broke in two.
580,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He looked up quickly, ""Sir, and you?"""
581,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I groped for something I should say;
582,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Amazement held me numb.  ""To-day"
583,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"You sweated at a fruitless task."""
584,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He spoke for me, ""What do you ask?"
585,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"How can I serve you?""  ""My kind host,"
586,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,My penniless state was not a boast;
587,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I have no money with me.""  He smiled."
588,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Not for that money I beguiled"
589,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"You here; you paid me in advance."""
590,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Again I felt as though a trance
591,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Had dimmed my faculties.  Again
592,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He spoke, and this time to explain."
593,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""The money I demand is Life,"
594,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Your nervous force, your joy, your strife!"""
595,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,What infamous proposal now
596,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Was made me with so calm a brow?
597,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Bursting through my lethargy,"
598,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Indignantly I hurled the cry:
599,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""Is this a nightmare, or am I"
600,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Drunk with some infernal wine?
601,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I am no Faust, and what is mine"
602,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Is what I call my soul!  Old Man!
603,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Devil or Ghost!  Your hellish plan
604,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Revolts me.  Let me go.""  ""My child,"""
605,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And the old tones were very mild,"
606,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""I have no wish to barter souls;"
607,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,My traffic does not ask such tolls.
608,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I am no devil; is there one?
609,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Surely the age of fear is gone.
610,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,We live within a daylight world
611,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Lit by the sun, where winds unfurled"
612,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Sweep clouds to scatter pattering rain,"
613,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And then blow back the sun again.
614,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I sell my fancies, or my swords,"
615,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"To those who care far more for words,"
616,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Ideas, of which they are the sign,"
617,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Than any other life-design.
618,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Who buy of me must simply pay
619,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Their whole existence quite away:
620,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Their strength, their manhood, and their prime,"
621,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Their hours from morning till the time
622,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"When evening comes on tiptoe feet,"
623,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And losing life, think it complete;"
624,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Must miss what other men count being,"
625,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,To gain the gift of deeper seeing;
626,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Must spurn all ease, all hindering love,"
627,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,All which could hold or bind; must prove
628,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"The farthest boundaries of thought,"
629,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And shun no end which these have brought;
630,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Then die in satisfaction, knowing"
631,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,That what was sown was worth the sowing.
632,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I claim for all the goods I sell
633,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"That they will serve their purpose well,"
634,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And though you perish, they will live."
635,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Full measure for your pay I give.
636,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"To-day you worked, you thought, in vain."
637,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,What since has happened is the train
638,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Your toiling brought.  I spoke to you
639,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"For my share of the bargain, due."""
640,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""My life!  And is that all you crave"
641,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,In pay?  What even childhood gave!
642,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I have been dedicate from youth.
643,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Before my God I speak the truth!"""
644,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Fatigue, excitement of the past"
645,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Few hours broke me down at last.
646,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"All day I had forgot to eat,"
647,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My nerves betrayed me, lacking meat."
648,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I bowed my head and felt the storm
649,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Plough shattering through my prostrate form.
650,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The tearless sobs tore at my heart.
651,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,My host withdrew himself apart;
652,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Busied among his crockery,"
653,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,He paid no farther heed to me.
654,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Exhausted, spent, I huddled there,"
655,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Within the arms of the old carved chair.
656,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
657,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"A long half-hour dragged away,"
658,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And then I heard a kind voice say,"
659,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"""The day will soon be dawning, when"
660,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,You must begin to work again.
661,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Here are the things which you require."""
662,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"By the fading light of the dying fire,"
663,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"And by the guttering candle's flare,"
664,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I saw the old man standing there.
665,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He handed me a packet, tied"
666,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"With crimson tape, and sealed.  ""Inside"
667,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Are seeds of many differing flowers,"
668,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,To occupy your utmost powers
669,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Of storied vision, and these swords"
670,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Are the finest which my shop affords.
671,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Go home and use them; do not spare
672,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Yourself; let that be all your care.
673,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Whatever you have means to buy
674,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Be very sure I can supply."""
675,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He slowly walked to the window, flung"
676,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"It open, and in the grey air rung"
677,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,The sound of distant matin bells.
678,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I took my parcels.  Then, as tells"
679,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"An ancient mumbling monk his beads,"
680,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,I tried to thank for his courteous deeds
681,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"My strange old friend.  ""Nay, do not talk,"""
682,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"He urged me, ""you have a long walk"
683,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"Before you.  Good-by and Good-day!"""
684,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,And gently sped upon my way
685,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,"I stumbled out in the morning hush,"
686,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,As down the empty street a flush
687,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Ran level from the rising sun.
688,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,Another day was just begun.
689,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
690,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
691,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
692,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
693,SWORD BLADES AND POPPY SEED,
694,SWORD BLADES,SWORD BLADES
695,SWORD BLADES,
696,SWORD BLADES,
697,SWORD BLADES,
698,SWORD BLADES,
699,SWORD BLADES,The Captured Goddess
700,SWORD BLADES,
701,SWORD BLADES,
702,SWORD BLADES,
703,SWORD BLADES,"Over the housetops,"
704,SWORD BLADES,"Above the rotating chimney-pots,"
705,SWORD BLADES,"I have seen a shiver of amethyst,"
706,SWORD BLADES,And blue and cinnamon have flickered
707,SWORD BLADES,"A moment,"
708,SWORD BLADES,At the far end of a dusty street.
709,SWORD BLADES,
710,SWORD BLADES,Through sheeted rain
711,SWORD BLADES,"Has come a lustre of crimson,"
712,SWORD BLADES,And I have watched moonbeams
713,SWORD BLADES,Hushed by a film of palest green.
714,SWORD BLADES,
715,SWORD BLADES,"It was her wings,"
716,SWORD BLADES,Goddess!
717,SWORD BLADES,"Who stepped over the clouds,"
718,SWORD BLADES,And laid her rainbow feathers
719,SWORD BLADES,Aslant on the currents of the air.
720,SWORD BLADES,
721,SWORD BLADES,"I followed her for long,"
722,SWORD BLADES,With gazing eyes and stumbling feet.
723,SWORD BLADES,"I cared not where she led me,"
724,SWORD BLADES,My eyes were full of colours:
725,SWORD BLADES,"Saffrons, rubies, the yellows of beryls,"
726,SWORD BLADES,And the indigo-blue of quartz;
727,SWORD BLADES,"Flights of rose, layers of chrysoprase,"
728,SWORD BLADES,"Points of orange, spirals of vermilion,"
729,SWORD BLADES,"The spotted gold of tiger-lily petals,"
730,SWORD BLADES,The loud pink of bursting hydrangeas.
731,SWORD BLADES,"I followed,"
732,SWORD BLADES,And watched for the flashing of her wings.
733,SWORD BLADES,
734,SWORD BLADES,"In the city I found her,"
735,SWORD BLADES,The narrow-streeted city.
736,SWORD BLADES,"In the market-place I came upon her,"
737,SWORD BLADES,Bound and trembling.
738,SWORD BLADES,"Her fluted wings were fastened to her sides with cords,"
739,SWORD BLADES,"She was naked and cold,"
740,SWORD BLADES,For that day the wind blew
741,SWORD BLADES,Without sunshine.
742,SWORD BLADES,
743,SWORD BLADES,"Men chaffered for her,"
744,SWORD BLADES,"They bargained in silver and gold,"
745,SWORD BLADES,"In copper, in wheat,"
746,SWORD BLADES,And called their bids across the market-place.
747,SWORD BLADES,
748,SWORD BLADES,The Goddess wept.
749,SWORD BLADES,
750,SWORD BLADES,"Hiding my face I fled,"
751,SWORD BLADES,"And the grey wind hissed behind me,"
752,SWORD BLADES,Along the narrow streets.
753,SWORD BLADES,
754,SWORD BLADES,
755,SWORD BLADES,
756,SWORD BLADES,
757,SWORD BLADES,The Precinct.  Rochester
758,SWORD BLADES,
759,SWORD BLADES,
760,SWORD BLADES,
761,SWORD BLADES,"The tall yellow hollyhocks stand,"
762,SWORD BLADES,"Still and straight,"
763,SWORD BLADES,"With their round blossoms spread open,"
764,SWORD BLADES,In the quiet sunshine.
765,SWORD BLADES,"And still is the old Roman wall,"
766,SWORD BLADES,"Rough with jagged bits of flint,"
767,SWORD BLADES,"And jutting stones,"
768,SWORD BLADES,"Old and cragged,"
769,SWORD BLADES,Quite still in its antiquity.
770,SWORD BLADES,"The pear-trees press their branches against it,"
771,SWORD BLADES,"And feeling it warm and kindly,"
772,SWORD BLADES,The little pears ripen to yellow and red.
773,SWORD BLADES,"They hang heavy, bursting with juice,"
774,SWORD BLADES,Against the wall.
775,SWORD BLADES,"So old, so still!"
776,SWORD BLADES,
777,SWORD BLADES,The sky is still.
778,SWORD BLADES,The clouds make no sound
779,SWORD BLADES,As they slide away
780,SWORD BLADES,"Beyond the Cathedral Tower,"
781,SWORD BLADES,"To the river,"
782,SWORD BLADES,And the sea.
783,SWORD BLADES,"It is very quiet,"
784,SWORD BLADES,Very sunny.
785,SWORD BLADES,"The myrtle flowers stretch themselves in the sunshine,"
786,SWORD BLADES,But make no sound.
787,SWORD BLADES,"The roses push their little tendrils up,"
788,SWORD BLADES,And climb higher and higher.
789,SWORD BLADES,In spots they have climbed over the wall.
790,SWORD BLADES,"But they are very still,"
791,SWORD BLADES,They do not seem to move.
792,SWORD BLADES,And the old wall carries them
793,SWORD BLADES,"Without effort, and quietly"
794,SWORD BLADES,Ripens and shields the vines and blossoms.
795,SWORD BLADES,
796,SWORD BLADES,A bird in a plane-tree
797,SWORD BLADES,"Sings a few notes,"
798,SWORD BLADES,Cadenced and perfect
799,SWORD BLADES,They weave into the silence.
800,SWORD BLADES,"The Cathedral bell knocks,"
801,SWORD BLADES,"One, two, three, and again,"
802,SWORD BLADES,And then again.
803,SWORD BLADES,"It is a quiet sound,"
804,SWORD BLADES,"Calling to prayer,"
805,SWORD BLADES,"Hardly scattering the stillness,"
806,SWORD BLADES,Only making it close in more densely.
807,SWORD BLADES,The gardener picks ripe gooseberries
808,SWORD BLADES,For the Dean's supper to-night.
809,SWORD BLADES,"It is very quiet,"
810,SWORD BLADES,Very regulated and mellow.
811,SWORD BLADES,"But the wall is old,"
812,SWORD BLADES,It has known many days.
813,SWORD BLADES,"It is a Roman wall,"
814,SWORD BLADES,Left-over and forgotten.
815,SWORD BLADES,
816,SWORD BLADES,Beyond the Cathedral Close
817,SWORD BLADES,"Yelp and mutter the discontents of people not mellow,"
818,SWORD BLADES,Not well-regulated.
819,SWORD BLADES,"People who care more for bread than for beauty,"
820,SWORD BLADES,"Who would break the tombs of saints,"
821,SWORD BLADES,And give the painted windows of churches
822,SWORD BLADES,To their children for toys.
823,SWORD BLADES,People who say:
824,SWORD BLADES,"""They are dead, we live!"
825,SWORD BLADES,"The world is for the living."""
826,SWORD BLADES,
827,SWORD BLADES,Fools!  It is always the dead who breed.
828,SWORD BLADES,"Crush the ripe fruit, and cast it aside,"
829,SWORD BLADES,"Yet its seeds shall fructify,"
830,SWORD BLADES,And trees rise where your huts were standing.
831,SWORD BLADES,"But the little people are ignorant,"
832,SWORD BLADES,"They chaffer, and swarm."
833,SWORD BLADES,"They gnaw like rats,"
834,SWORD BLADES,And the foundations of the Cathedral are honeycombed.
835,SWORD BLADES,
836,SWORD BLADES,The Dean is in the Chapter House;
837,SWORD BLADES,He is reading the architect's bill
838,SWORD BLADES,For the completed restoration of the Cathedral.
839,SWORD BLADES,"He will have ripe gooseberries for supper,"
840,SWORD BLADES,And then he will walk up and down the path
841,SWORD BLADES,"By the wall,"
842,SWORD BLADES,"And admire the snapdragons and dahlias,"
843,SWORD BLADES,Thinking how quiet and peaceful
844,SWORD BLADES,The garden is.
845,SWORD BLADES,"The old wall will watch him,"
846,SWORD BLADES,Very quietly and patiently it will watch.
847,SWORD BLADES,"For the wall is old,"
848,SWORD BLADES,It is a Roman wall.
849,SWORD BLADES,
850,SWORD BLADES,
851,SWORD BLADES,
852,SWORD BLADES,
853,SWORD BLADES,The Cyclists
854,SWORD BLADES,
855,SWORD BLADES,
856,SWORD BLADES,
857,SWORD BLADES,"Spread on the roadway,"
858,SWORD BLADES,"With open-blown jackets,"
859,SWORD BLADES,"Like black, soaring pinions,"
860,SWORD BLADES,"They swoop down the hillside,"
861,SWORD BLADES,The Cyclists.
862,SWORD BLADES,
863,SWORD BLADES,Seeming dark-plumaged
864,SWORD BLADES,"Birds, after carrion,"
865,SWORD BLADES,"Careening and circling,"
866,SWORD BLADES,Over the dying
867,SWORD BLADES,Of England.
868,SWORD BLADES,
869,SWORD BLADES,She lies with her bosom
870,SWORD BLADES,"Beneath them, no longer"
871,SWORD BLADES,"The Dominant Mother,"
872,SWORD BLADES,The Virile--but rotting
873,SWORD BLADES,Before time.
874,SWORD BLADES,
875,SWORD BLADES,"The smell of her, tainted,"
876,SWORD BLADES,Has bitten their nostrils.
877,SWORD BLADES,"Exultant they hover,"
878,SWORD BLADES,And shadow the sun with
879,SWORD BLADES,Foreboding.
880,SWORD BLADES,
881,SWORD BLADES,
882,SWORD BLADES,
883,SWORD BLADES,
884,SWORD BLADES,Sunshine through a Cobwebbed Window
885,SWORD BLADES,
886,SWORD BLADES,
887,SWORD BLADES,
888,SWORD BLADES,"What charm is yours, you faded old-world tapestries,"
889,SWORD BLADES,"Of outworn, childish mysteries,"
890,SWORD BLADES,Vague pageants woven on a web of dream!
891,SWORD BLADES,"And we, pushing and fighting in the turbid stream"
892,SWORD BLADES,"Of modern life, find solace in your tarnished broideries."
893,SWORD BLADES,
894,SWORD BLADES,"Old lichened halls, sun-shaded by huge cedar-trees,"
895,SWORD BLADES,"The layered branches horizontal stretched, like Japanese"
896,SWORD BLADES,"Dark-banded prints.  Carven cathedrals, on a sky"
897,SWORD BLADES,"Of faintest colour, where the gothic spires fly"
898,SWORD BLADES,"And sway like masts, against a shifting breeze."
899,SWORD BLADES,
900,SWORD BLADES,"Worm-eaten pages, clasped in old brown vellum, shrunk"
901,SWORD BLADES,"From over-handling, by some anxious monk."
902,SWORD BLADES,"Or Virgin's Hours, bright with gold and graven"
903,SWORD BLADES,"With flowers, and rare birds, and all the Saints of Heaven,"
904,SWORD BLADES,"And Noah's ark stuck on Ararat, when all the world had sunk."
905,SWORD BLADES,
906,SWORD BLADES,"They soothe us like a song, heard in a garden, sung"
907,SWORD BLADES,"By youthful minstrels, on the moonlight flung"
908,SWORD BLADES,"In cadences and falls, to ease a queen,"
909,SWORD BLADES,"Widowed and childless, cowering in a screen"
910,SWORD BLADES,"Of myrtles, whose life hangs with all its threads unstrung."
911,SWORD BLADES,
912,SWORD BLADES,
913,SWORD BLADES,
914,SWORD BLADES,
915,SWORD BLADES,A London Thoroughfare.  2 A.M.
916,SWORD BLADES,
917,SWORD BLADES,
918,SWORD BLADES,
919,SWORD BLADES,"They have watered the street,"
920,SWORD BLADES,"It shines in the glare of lamps,"
921,SWORD BLADES,"Cold, white lamps,"
922,SWORD BLADES,And lies
923,SWORD BLADES,"Like a slow-moving river,"
924,SWORD BLADES,Barred with silver and black.
925,SWORD BLADES,"Cabs go down it,"
926,SWORD BLADES,"One,"
927,SWORD BLADES,And then another.
928,SWORD BLADES,Between them I hear the shuffling of feet.
929,SWORD BLADES,"Tramps doze on the window-ledges,"
930,SWORD BLADES,Night-walkers pass along the sidewalks.
931,SWORD BLADES,"The city is squalid and sinister,"
932,SWORD BLADES,"With the silver-barred street in the midst,"
933,SWORD BLADES,"Slow-moving,"
934,SWORD BLADES,A river leading nowhere.
935,SWORD BLADES,
936,SWORD BLADES,"Opposite my window,"
937,SWORD BLADES,"The moon cuts,"
938,SWORD BLADES,"Clear and round,"
939,SWORD BLADES,Through the plum-coloured night.
940,SWORD BLADES,She cannot light the city;
941,SWORD BLADES,It is too bright.
942,SWORD BLADES,"It has white lamps,"
943,SWORD BLADES,And glitters coldly.
944,SWORD BLADES,
945,SWORD BLADES,I stand in the window and watch the moon.
946,SWORD BLADES,"She is thin and lustreless,"
947,SWORD BLADES,But I love her.
948,SWORD BLADES,"I know the moon,"
949,SWORD BLADES,And this is an alien city.
950,SWORD BLADES,
951,SWORD BLADES,
952,SWORD BLADES,
953,SWORD BLADES,
954,SWORD BLADES,Astigmatism
955,SWORD BLADES,
956,SWORD BLADES,To Ezra Pound
957,SWORD BLADES,
958,SWORD BLADES,With much friendship and admiration and some differences of opinion
959,SWORD BLADES,
960,SWORD BLADES,
961,SWORD BLADES,
962,SWORD BLADES,The Poet took his walking-stick
963,SWORD BLADES,Of fine and polished ebony.
964,SWORD BLADES,Set in the close-grained wood
965,SWORD BLADES,Were quaint devices;
966,SWORD BLADES,"Patterns in ambers,"
967,SWORD BLADES,And in the clouded green of jades.
968,SWORD BLADES,"The top was of smooth, yellow ivory,"
969,SWORD BLADES,And a tassel of tarnished gold
970,SWORD BLADES,Hung by a faded cord from a hole
971,SWORD BLADES,"Pierced in the hard wood,"
972,SWORD BLADES,Circled with silver.
973,SWORD BLADES,For years the Poet had wrought upon this cane.
974,SWORD BLADES,"His wealth had gone to enrich it,"
975,SWORD BLADES,"His experiences to pattern it,"
976,SWORD BLADES,His labour to fashion and burnish it.
977,SWORD BLADES,"To him it was perfect,"
978,SWORD BLADES,"A work of art and a weapon,"
979,SWORD BLADES,A delight and a defence.
980,SWORD BLADES,The Poet took his walking-stick
981,SWORD BLADES,And walked abroad.
982,SWORD BLADES,
983,SWORD BLADES,"Peace be with you, Brother."
984,SWORD BLADES,
985,SWORD BLADES,
986,SWORD BLADES,The Poet came to a meadow.
987,SWORD BLADES,"Sifted through the grass were daisies,"
988,SWORD BLADES,"Open-mouthed, wondering, they gazed at the sun."
989,SWORD BLADES,The Poet struck them with his cane.
990,SWORD BLADES,"The little heads flew off, and they lay"
991,SWORD BLADES,"Dying, open-mouthed and wondering,"
992,SWORD BLADES,On the hard ground.
993,SWORD BLADES,"""They are useless.  They are not roses,"" said the Poet."
994,SWORD BLADES,
995,SWORD BLADES,"Peace be with you, Brother.  Go your ways."
996,SWORD BLADES,
997,SWORD BLADES,
998,SWORD BLADES,The Poet came to a stream.
999,SWORD BLADES,Purple and blue flags waded in the water;
1000,SWORD BLADES,In among them hopped the speckled frogs;
1001,SWORD BLADES,"The wind slid through them, rustling."
1002,SWORD BLADES,"The Poet lifted his cane,"
1003,SWORD BLADES,And the iris heads fell into the water.
1004,SWORD BLADES,"They floated away, torn and drowning."
1005,SWORD BLADES,"""Wretched flowers,"" said the Poet,"
1006,SWORD BLADES,"""They are not roses."""
1007,SWORD BLADES,
1008,SWORD BLADES,"Peace be with you, Brother.  It is your affair."
1009,SWORD BLADES,
1010,SWORD BLADES,
1011,SWORD BLADES,The Poet came to a garden.
1012,SWORD BLADES,"Dahlias ripened against a wall,"
1013,SWORD BLADES,"Gillyflowers stood up bravely for all their short stature,"
1014,SWORD BLADES,And a trumpet-vine covered an arbour
1015,SWORD BLADES,With the red and gold of its blossoms.
1016,SWORD BLADES,Red and gold like the brass notes of trumpets.
1017,SWORD BLADES,"The Poet knocked off the stiff heads of the dahlias,"
1018,SWORD BLADES,And his cane lopped the gillyflowers at the ground.
1019,SWORD BLADES,Then he severed the trumpet-blossoms from their stems.
1020,SWORD BLADES,"Red and gold they lay scattered,"
1021,SWORD BLADES,"Red and gold, as on a battle field;"
1022,SWORD BLADES,"Red and gold, prone and dying."
1023,SWORD BLADES,"""They were not roses,"" said the Poet."
1024,SWORD BLADES,
1025,SWORD BLADES,"Peace be with you, Brother."
1026,SWORD BLADES,"But behind you is destruction, and waste places."
1027,SWORD BLADES,
1028,SWORD BLADES,
1029,SWORD BLADES,"The Poet came home at evening,"
1030,SWORD BLADES,And in the candle-light
1031,SWORD BLADES,He wiped and polished his cane.
1032,SWORD BLADES,"The orange candle flame leaped in the yellow ambers,"
1033,SWORD BLADES,And made the jades undulate like green pools.
1034,SWORD BLADES,"It played along the bright ebony,"
1035,SWORD BLADES,And glowed in the top of cream-coloured ivory.
1036,SWORD BLADES,"But these things were dead,"
1037,SWORD BLADES,Only the candle-light made them seem to move.
1038,SWORD BLADES,"""It is a pity there were no roses,"" said the Poet."
1039,SWORD BLADES,
1040,SWORD BLADES,"Peace be with you, Brother.  You have chosen your part."
1041,SWORD BLADES,
1042,SWORD BLADES,
1043,SWORD BLADES,
1044,SWORD BLADES,
1045,SWORD BLADES,The Coal Picker
1046,SWORD BLADES,
1047,SWORD BLADES,
1048,SWORD BLADES,
1049,SWORD BLADES,"He perches in the slime, inert,"
1050,SWORD BLADES,Bedaubed with iridescent dirt.
1051,SWORD BLADES,The oil upon the puddles dries
1052,SWORD BLADES,"To colours like a peacock's eyes,"
1053,SWORD BLADES,And half-submerged tomato-cans
1054,SWORD BLADES,"Shine scaly, as leviathans"
1055,SWORD BLADES,Oozily crawling through the mud.
1056,SWORD BLADES,The ground is here and there bestud
1057,SWORD BLADES,With lumps of only part-burned coal.
1058,SWORD BLADES,"His duty is to glean the whole,"
1059,SWORD BLADES,"To pick them from the filth, each one,"
1060,SWORD BLADES,To hoard them for the hidden sun
1061,SWORD BLADES,Which glows within each fiery core
1062,SWORD BLADES,And waits to be made free once more.
1063,SWORD BLADES,Their sharp and glistening edges cut
1064,SWORD BLADES,His stiffened fingers.  Through the smut
1065,SWORD BLADES,Gleam red the wounds which will not shut.
1066,SWORD BLADES,Wet through and shivering he kneels
1067,SWORD BLADES,And digs the slippery coals; like eels
1068,SWORD BLADES,"They slide about.  His force all spent,"
1069,SWORD BLADES,He counts his small accomplishment.
1070,SWORD BLADES,A half-a-dozen clinker-coals
1071,SWORD BLADES,Which still have fire in their souls.
1072,SWORD BLADES,Fire!  And in his thought there burns
1073,SWORD BLADES,The topaz fire of votive urns.
1074,SWORD BLADES,"He sees it fling from hill to hill,"
1075,SWORD BLADES,"And still consumed, is burning still."
1076,SWORD BLADES,"Higher and higher leaps the flame,"
1077,SWORD BLADES,The smoke an ever-shifting frame.
1078,SWORD BLADES,"He sees a Spanish Castle old,"
1079,SWORD BLADES,With silver steps and paths of gold.
1080,SWORD BLADES,From myrtle bowers comes the plash
1081,SWORD BLADES,"Of fountains, and the emerald flash"
1082,SWORD BLADES,"Of parrots in the orange trees,"
1083,SWORD BLADES,Whose blossoms pasture humming bees.
1084,SWORD BLADES,He knows he feeds the urns whose smoke
1085,SWORD BLADES,"Bears visions, that his master-stroke"
1086,SWORD BLADES,Is out of dirt and misery
1087,SWORD BLADES,To light the fire of poesy.
1088,SWORD BLADES,"He sees the glory, yet he knows"
1089,SWORD BLADES,That others cannot see his shows.
1090,SWORD BLADES,"To them his smoke is sightless, black,"
1091,SWORD BLADES,His votive vessels but a pack
1092,SWORD BLADES,"Of old discarded shards, his fire"
1093,SWORD BLADES,A peddler's; still to him the pyre
1094,SWORD BLADES,"Is incensed, an enduring goal!"
1095,SWORD BLADES,He sighs and grubs another coal.
1096,SWORD BLADES,
1097,SWORD BLADES,
1098,SWORD BLADES,
1099,SWORD BLADES,
1100,SWORD BLADES,Storm-Racked
1101,SWORD BLADES,
1102,SWORD BLADES,
1103,SWORD BLADES,
1104,SWORD BLADES,How should I sing when buffeting salt waves
1105,SWORD BLADES,"And stung with bitter surges, in whose might"
1106,SWORD BLADES,"I toss, a cockleshell?  The dreadful night"
1107,SWORD BLADES,Marshals its undefeated dark and raves
1108,SWORD BLADES,"In brutal madness, reeling over graves"
1109,SWORD BLADES,"Of vanquished men, long-sunken out of sight,"
1110,SWORD BLADES,Sent wailing down to glut the ghoulish sprite
1111,SWORD BLADES,Who haunts foul seaweed forests and their caves.
1112,SWORD BLADES,"No parting cloud reveals a watery star,"
1113,SWORD BLADES,"My cries are washed away upon the wind,"
1114,SWORD BLADES,"My cramped and blistering hands can find no spar,"
1115,SWORD BLADES,"My eyes with hope o'erstrained, are growing blind."
1116,SWORD BLADES,"But painted on the sky great visions burn,"
1117,SWORD BLADES,"My voice, oblation from a shattered urn!"

1120,SWORD BLADES,

1122,SWORD BLADES,Convalescence
1123,SWORD BLADES,
1124,SWORD BLADES,
1125,SWORD BLADES,
1126,SWORD BLADES,"From out the dragging vastness of the sea,"
1127,SWORD BLADES,"Wave-fettered, bound in sinuous, seaweed strands,"
1128,SWORD BLADES,"He toils toward the rounding beach, and stands"
1129,SWORD BLADES,"One moment, white and dripping, silently,"
1130,SWORD BLADES,"Cut like a cameo in lazuli,"
1131,SWORD BLADES,"Then falls, betrayed by shifting shells, and lands"
1132,SWORD BLADES,"Prone in the jeering water, and his hands"
1133,SWORD BLADES,Clutch for support where no support can be.
1134,SWORD BLADES,"So up, and down, and forward, inch by inch,"
1135,SWORD BLADES,"He gains upon the shore, where poppies glow"
1136,SWORD BLADES,And sandflies dance their little lives away.
1137,SWORD BLADES,"The sucking waves retard, and tighter clinch"
1138,SWORD BLADES,"The weeds about him, but the land-winds blow,"
1139,SWORD BLADES,And in the sky there blooms the sun of May.
1140,SWORD BLADES,
1141,SWORD BLADES,
1142,SWORD BLADES,

1144,SWORD BLADES,Patience
1145,SWORD BLADES,
1146,SWORD BLADES,
1147,SWORD BLADES,
1148,SWORD BLADES,Be patient with you?
1149,SWORD BLADES,When the stooping sky
1150,SWORD BLADES,Leans down upon the hills
1151,SWORD BLADES,"And tenderly, as one who soothing stills"
1152,SWORD BLADES,"An anguish, gathers earth to lie"
1153,SWORD BLADES,Embraced and girdled.  Do the sun-filled men
1154,SWORD BLADES,Feel patience then?
1155,SWORD BLADES,
1156,SWORD BLADES,Be patient with you?
1157,SWORD BLADES,When the snow-girt earth
1158,SWORD BLADES,Cracks to let through a spurt
1159,SWORD BLADES,"Of sudden green, and from the muddy dirt"
1160,SWORD BLADES,"A snowdrop leaps, how mark its worth"
1161,SWORD BLADES,"To eyes frost-hardened, and do weary men"
1162,SWORD BLADES,Feel patience then?
1163,SWORD BLADES,
1164,SWORD BLADES,Be patient with you?
1165,SWORD BLADES,When pain's iron bars
1166,SWORD BLADES,"Their rivets tighten, stern"
1167,SWORD BLADES,"To bend and break their victims; as they turn,"
1168,SWORD BLADES,"Hopeless, there stand the purple jars"
1169,SWORD BLADES,Of night to spill oblivion.  Do these men
1170,SWORD BLADES,Feel patience then?
1171,SWORD BLADES,
1172,SWORD BLADES,Be patient with you?
1173,SWORD BLADES,You!  My sun and moon!
1174,SWORD BLADES,My basketful of flowers!
1175,SWORD BLADES,"My money-bag of shining dreams!  My hours,"
1176,SWORD BLADES,"Windless and still, of afternoon!"
1177,SWORD BLADES,You are my world and I your citizen.
1178,SWORD BLADES,What meaning can have patience then?

1183,SWORD BLADES,Apology
1184,SWORD BLADES,
1185,SWORD BLADES,
1186,SWORD BLADES,
1187,SWORD BLADES,Be not angry with me that I bear
1188,SWORD BLADES,"Your colours everywhere,"
1189,SWORD BLADES,"All through each crowded street,"
1190,SWORD BLADES,And meet
1191,SWORD BLADES,"The wonder-light in every eye,"
1192,SWORD BLADES,As I go by.
1193,SWORD BLADES,
1194,SWORD BLADES,"Each plodding wayfarer looks up to gaze,"
1195,SWORD BLADES,"Blinded by rainbow haze,"
1196,SWORD BLADES,"The stuff of happiness,"
1197,SWORD BLADES,"No less,"
1198,SWORD BLADES,Which wraps me in its glad-hued folds
1199,SWORD BLADES,Of peacock golds.
1200,SWORD BLADES,
1201,SWORD BLADES,"Before my feet the dusty, rough-paved way"
1202,SWORD BLADES,Flushes beneath its gray.
1203,SWORD BLADES,"My steps fall ringed with light,"
1204,SWORD BLADES,"So bright,"
1205,SWORD BLADES,It seems a myriad suns are strown
1206,SWORD BLADES,About the town.
1207,SWORD BLADES,
1208,SWORD BLADES,"Around me is the sound of steepled bells,"
1209,SWORD BLADES,And rich perfumed smells
1210,SWORD BLADES,"Hang like a wind-forgotten cloud,"
1211,SWORD BLADES,And shroud
1212,SWORD BLADES,Me from close contact with the world.
1213,SWORD BLADES,I dwell impearled.
1214,SWORD BLADES,
1215,SWORD BLADES,You blazon me with jewelled insignia.
1216,SWORD BLADES,A flaming nebula
1217,SWORD BLADES,Rims in my life.  And yet
1218,SWORD BLADES,You set
1219,SWORD BLADES,"The word upon me, unconfessed"
1220,SWORD BLADES,To go unguessed.
1221,SWORD BLADES,
1222,SWORD BLADES,

1225,SWORD BLADES,A Petition
1226,SWORD BLADES,
1227,SWORD BLADES,
1228,SWORD BLADES,
1229,SWORD BLADES,I pray to be the tool which to your hand
1230,SWORD BLADES,Long use has shaped and moulded till it be
1231,SWORD BLADES,"Apt for your need, and, unconsideringly,"
1232,SWORD BLADES,You take it for its service.  I demand
1233,SWORD BLADES,To be forgotten in the woven strand
1234,SWORD BLADES,Which grows the multi-coloured tapestry
1235,SWORD BLADES,"Of your bright life, and through its tissues lie"
1236,SWORD BLADES,"A hidden, strong, sustaining, grey-toned band."
1237,SWORD BLADES,"I wish to dwell around your daylight dreams,"
1238,SWORD BLADES,"The railing to the stairway of the clouds,"
1239,SWORD BLADES,"To guard your steps securely up, where streams"
1240,SWORD BLADES,A faery moonshine washing pale the crowds
1241,SWORD BLADES,Of pointed stars.  Remember not whereby
1242,SWORD BLADES,"You mount, protected, to the far-flung sky."
1243,SWORD BLADES,
1244,SWORD BLADES,
1245,SWORD BLADES,

1248,SWORD BLADES,
1249,SWORD BLADES,
1250,SWORD BLADES,
1251,SWORD BLADES,"Before me lies a mass of shapeless days,"
1252,SWORD BLADES,"Unseparated atoms, and I must"
1253,SWORD BLADES,Sort them apart and live them.  Sifted dust
1254,SWORD BLADES,"Covers the formless heap.  Reprieves, delays,"
1255,SWORD BLADES,"There are none, ever.  As a monk who prays"
1256,SWORD BLADES,"The sliding beads asunder, so I thrust"
1257,SWORD BLADES,"Each tasteless particle aside, and just"
1258,SWORD BLADES,Begin again the task which never stays.
1259,SWORD BLADES,"And I have known a glory of great suns,"
1260,SWORD BLADES,"When days flashed by, pulsing with joy and fire!"
1261,SWORD BLADES,"Drunk bubbled wine in goblets of desire,"
1262,SWORD BLADES,And felt the whipped blood laughing as it runs!
1263,SWORD BLADES,"Spilt is that liquor, my too hasty hand"
1264,SWORD BLADES,"Threw down the cup, and did not understand."
1265,SWORD BLADES,
1266,SWORD BLADES,
1267,SWORD BLADES,
1268,SWORD BLADES,
1269,SWORD BLADES,Stupidity
1270,SWORD BLADES,
1271,SWORD BLADES,
1272,SWORD BLADES,
1273,SWORD BLADES,"Dearest, forgive that with my clumsy touch"
1274,SWORD BLADES,I broke and bruised your rose.
1275,SWORD BLADES,I hardly could suppose
1276,SWORD BLADES,It were a thing so fragile that my clutch
1277,SWORD BLADES,"Could kill it, thus."
1278,SWORD BLADES,
1279,SWORD BLADES,"It stood so proudly up upon its stem,"
1280,SWORD BLADES,"I knew no thought of fear,"
1281,SWORD BLADES,And coming very near
1282,SWORD BLADES,"Fell, overbalanced, to your garment's hem,"
1283,SWORD BLADES,Tearing it down.
1284,SWORD BLADES,
1285,SWORD BLADES,"Now, stooping, I upgather, one by one,"
1286,SWORD BLADES,"The crimson petals, all"
1287,SWORD BLADES,Outspread about my fall.
1288,SWORD BLADES,"They hold their fragrance still, a blood-red cone"
1289,SWORD BLADES,Of memory.
1290,SWORD BLADES,
1291,SWORD BLADES,And with my words I carve a little jar
1292,SWORD BLADES,"To keep their scented dust,"
1293,SWORD BLADES,"Which, opening, you must"
1294,SWORD BLADES,"Breathe to your soul, and, breathing, know me far"
1295,SWORD BLADES,More grieved than you.
1296,SWORD BLADES,
1297,SWORD BLADES,

1299,SWORD BLADES,
1300,SWORD BLADES,Irony
1301,SWORD BLADES,
1302,SWORD BLADES,
1303,SWORD BLADES,
1304,SWORD BLADES,An arid daylight shines along the beach
1305,SWORD BLADES,"Dried to a grey monotony of tone,"
1306,SWORD BLADES,And stranded jelly-fish melt soft upon
1307,SWORD BLADES,"The sun-baked pebbles, far beyond their reach"
1308,SWORD BLADES,"Sparkles a wet, reviving sea.  Here bleach"
1309,SWORD BLADES,"The skeletons of fishes, every bone"
1310,SWORD BLADES,"Polished and stark, like traceries of stone,"
1311,SWORD BLADES,The joints and knuckles hardened each to each.
1312,SWORD BLADES,"And they are dead while waiting for the sea,"
1313,SWORD BLADES,"The moon-pursuing sea, to come again."
1314,SWORD BLADES,Their hearts are blown away on the hot breeze.
1315,SWORD BLADES,Only the shells and stones can wait to be
1316,SWORD BLADES,"Washed bright.  For living things, who suffer pain,"
1317,SWORD BLADES,May not endure till time can bring them ease.

1322,SWORD BLADES,Happiness
1323,SWORD BLADES,
1324,SWORD BLADES,
1325,SWORD BLADES,
1326,SWORD BLADES,"Happiness, to some, elation;"
1327,SWORD BLADES,"Is, to others, mere stagnation."
1328,SWORD BLADES,"Days of passive somnolence,"
1329,SWORD BLADES,"At its wildest, indolence."
1330,SWORD BLADES,"Hours of empty quietness,"
1331,SWORD BLADES,"No delight, and no distress."
1332,SWORD BLADES,
1333,SWORD BLADES,"Happiness to me is wine,"
1334,SWORD BLADES,"Effervescent, superfine."
1335,SWORD BLADES,"Full of tang and fiery pleasure,"
1336,SWORD BLADES,Far too hot to leave me leisure
1337,SWORD BLADES,For a single thought beyond it.
1338,SWORD BLADES,Drunk!  Forgetful!  This the bond:  it
1339,SWORD BLADES,Means to give one's soul to gain
1340,SWORD BLADES,Life's quintessence.  Even pain
1341,SWORD BLADES,"Pricks to livelier living, then"
1342,SWORD BLADES,"Wakes the nerves to laugh again,"
1343,SWORD BLADES,Rapture's self is three parts sorrow.
1344,SWORD BLADES,"Although we must die to-morrow,"
1345,SWORD BLADES,Losing every thought but this;
1346,SWORD BLADES,"Torn, triumphant, drowned in bliss."
1347,SWORD BLADES,
1348,SWORD BLADES,Happiness:  We rarely feel it.
1349,SWORD BLADES,"I would buy it, beg it, steal it,"
1350,SWORD BLADES,Pay in coins of dripping blood
1351,SWORD BLADES,For this one transcendent good.

1357,SWORD BLADES,
1358,SWORD BLADES,
1359,SWORD BLADES,
1360,SWORD BLADES,"How long shall I tarnish the mirror of life,"
1361,SWORD BLADES,A spatter of rust on its polished steel!
1362,SWORD BLADES,The seasons reel
1363,SWORD BLADES,Like a goaded wheel.
1364,SWORD BLADES,"Half-numb, half-maddened, my days are strife."
1365,SWORD BLADES,
1366,SWORD BLADES,"The night is sliding towards the dawn,"
1367,SWORD BLADES,And upturned hills crouch at autumn's knees.
1368,SWORD BLADES,A torn moon flees
1369,SWORD BLADES,"Through the hemlock trees,"
1370,SWORD BLADES,The hours have gnawed it to feed their spawn.
1371,SWORD BLADES,
1372,SWORD BLADES,Pursuing and jeering the misshapen thing
1373,SWORD BLADES,A rabble of clouds flares out of the east.
1374,SWORD BLADES,Like dogs unleashed
1375,SWORD BLADES,"After a beast,"
1376,SWORD BLADES,"They stream on the sky, an outflung string."
1377,SWORD BLADES,
1378,SWORD BLADES,"A desolate wind, through the unpeopled dark,"
1379,SWORD BLADES,"Shakes the bushes and whistles through empty nests,"
1380,SWORD BLADES,And the fierce unrests
1381,SWORD BLADES,I keep as guests
1382,SWORD BLADES,"Crowd my brain with corpses, pallid and stark."
1383,SWORD BLADES,
1384,SWORD BLADES,"Leave me in peace, O Spectres, who haunt"
1385,SWORD BLADES,"My labouring mind, I have fought and failed."
1386,SWORD BLADES,"I have not quailed,"
1387,SWORD BLADES,I was all unmailed
1388,SWORD BLADES,"And naked I strove, 'tis my only vaunt."
1389,SWORD BLADES,
1390,SWORD BLADES,The moon drops into the silver day
1391,SWORD BLADES,As waking out of her swoon she comes.
1392,SWORD BLADES,I hear the drums
1393,SWORD BLADES,Of millenniums
1394,SWORD BLADES,Beating the mornings I still must stay.
1395,SWORD BLADES,
1396,SWORD BLADES,"The years I must watch go in and out,"
1397,SWORD BLADES,"While I build with water, and dig in air,"
1398,SWORD BLADES,And the trumpets blare
1399,SWORD BLADES,"Hollow despair,"
1400,SWORD BLADES,The shuddering trumpets of utter rout.
1401,SWORD BLADES,
1402,SWORD BLADES,An atom tossed in a chaos made
1403,SWORD BLADES,"Of yeasting worlds, which bubble and foam."
1404,SWORD BLADES,Whence have I come?
1405,SWORD BLADES,What would be home?
1406,SWORD BLADES,I hear no answer.  I am afraid!
1407,SWORD BLADES,
1408,SWORD BLADES,I crave to be lost like a wind-blown flame.
1409,SWORD BLADES,"Pushed into nothingness by a breath,"
1410,SWORD BLADES,And quench in a wreath
1411,SWORD BLADES,Of engulfing death
1412,SWORD BLADES,"This fight for a God, or this devil's game."

1417,SWORD BLADES,A Tale of Starvation
1418,SWORD BLADES,
1419,SWORD BLADES,
1420,SWORD BLADES,
1421,SWORD BLADES,"There once was a man whom the gods didn't love,"
1422,SWORD BLADES,And a disagreeable man was he.
1423,SWORD BLADES,"He loathed his neighbours, and his neighbours hated him,"
1424,SWORD BLADES,And he cursed eternally.
1425,SWORD BLADES,
1426,SWORD BLADES,"He damned the sun, and he damned the stars,"
1427,SWORD BLADES,And he blasted the winds in the sky.
1428,SWORD BLADES,"He sent to Hell every green, growing thing,"
1429,SWORD BLADES,And he raved at the birds as they fly.
1430,SWORD BLADES,
1431,SWORD BLADES,"His oaths were many, and his range was wide,"
1432,SWORD BLADES,He swore in fancy ways;
1433,SWORD BLADES,But his meaning was plain:  that no created thing
1434,SWORD BLADES,Was other than a hurt to his gaze.
1435,SWORD BLADES,
1436,SWORD BLADES,"He dwelt all alone, underneath a leaning hill,"
1437,SWORD BLADES,"And windows toward the hill there were none,"
1438,SWORD BLADES,"And on the other side they were white-washed thick,"
1439,SWORD BLADES,To keep out every spark of the sun.
1440,SWORD BLADES,
1441,SWORD BLADES,When he went to market he walked all the way
1442,SWORD BLADES,Blaspheming at the path he trod.
1443,SWORD BLADES,"He cursed at those he bought of, and swore at those he sold to,"
1444,SWORD BLADES,By all the names he knew of God.
1445,SWORD BLADES,
1446,SWORD BLADES,"For his heart was soured in his weary old hide,"
1447,SWORD BLADES,And his hopes had curdled in his breast.
1448,SWORD BLADES,"His friend had been untrue, and his love had thrown him over"
1449,SWORD BLADES,For the chinking money-bags she liked best.
1450,SWORD BLADES,
1451,SWORD BLADES,"The rats had devoured the contents of his grain-bin,"
1452,SWORD BLADES,"The deer had trampled on his corn,"
1453,SWORD BLADES,"His brook had shrivelled in a summer drought,"
1454,SWORD BLADES,And his sheep had died unshorn.
1455,SWORD BLADES,
1456,SWORD BLADES,"His hens wouldn't lay, and his cow broke loose,"
1457,SWORD BLADES,And his old horse perished of a colic.
1458,SWORD BLADES,In the loft his wheat-bags were nibbled into holes
1459,SWORD BLADES,"By little, glutton mice on a frolic."
1460,SWORD BLADES,
1461,SWORD BLADES,"So he slowly lost all he ever had,"
1462,SWORD BLADES,And the blood in his body dried.
1463,SWORD BLADES,"Shrunken and mean he still lived on,"
1464,SWORD BLADES,And cursed that future which had lied.
1465,SWORD BLADES,
1466,SWORD BLADES,"One day he was digging, a spade or two,"
1467,SWORD BLADES,"As his aching back could lift,"
1468,SWORD BLADES,"When he saw something glisten at the bottom of the trench,"
1469,SWORD BLADES,And to get it out he made great shift.
1470,SWORD BLADES,
1471,SWORD BLADES,"So he dug, and he delved, with care and pain,"
1472,SWORD BLADES,And the veins in his forehead stood taut.
1473,SWORD BLADES,"At the end of an hour, when every bone cracked,"
1474,SWORD BLADES,He gathered up what he had sought.
1475,SWORD BLADES,
1476,SWORD BLADES,"A dim old vase of crusted glass,"
1477,SWORD BLADES,Prismed while it lay buried deep.
1478,SWORD BLADES,"Shifting reds and greens, like a pigeon's neck,"
1479,SWORD BLADES,At the touch of the sun began to leap.
1480,SWORD BLADES,
1481,SWORD BLADES,"It was dull in the tree-shade, but glowing in the light;"
1482,SWORD BLADES,"Flashing like an opal-stone,"
1483,SWORD BLADES,"Carved into a flagon; and the colours glanced and ran,"
1484,SWORD BLADES,Where at first there had seemed to be none.
1485,SWORD BLADES,
1486,SWORD BLADES,"It had handles on each side to bear it up,"
1487,SWORD BLADES,And a belly for the gurgling wine.
1488,SWORD BLADES,"Its neck was slender, and its mouth was wide,"
1489,SWORD BLADES,And its lip was curled and fine.
1490,SWORD BLADES,
1491,SWORD BLADES,The old man saw it in the sun's bright stare
1492,SWORD BLADES,"And the colours started up through the crust,"
1493,SWORD BLADES,And he who had cursed at the yellow sun
1494,SWORD BLADES,Held the flask to it and wiped away the dust.
1495,SWORD BLADES,
1496,SWORD BLADES,"And he bore the flask to the brightest spot,"
1497,SWORD BLADES,Where the shadow of the hill fell clear;
1498,SWORD BLADES,"And he turned the flask, and he looked at the flask,"
1499,SWORD BLADES,And the sun shone without his sneer.
1500,SWORD BLADES,
1501,SWORD BLADES,"Then he carried it home, and put it on a shelf,"
1502,SWORD BLADES,But it was only grey in the gloom.
1503,SWORD BLADES,"So he fetched a pail, and a bit of cloth,"
1504,SWORD BLADES,And he went outside with a broom.
1505,SWORD BLADES,
1506,SWORD BLADES,And he washed his windows just to let the sun
1507,SWORD BLADES,Lie upon his new-found vase;
1508,SWORD BLADES,"And when evening came, he moved it down"
1509,SWORD BLADES,And put it on a table near the place
1510,SWORD BLADES,
1511,SWORD BLADES,Where a candle fluttered in a draught from the door.
1512,SWORD BLADES,"The old man forgot to swear,"
1513,SWORD BLADES,"Watching its shadow grown a mammoth size,"
1514,SWORD BLADES,Dancing in the kitchen there.
1515,SWORD BLADES,
1516,SWORD BLADES,He forgot to revile the sun next morning
1517,SWORD BLADES,When he found his vase afire in its light.
1518,SWORD BLADES,"And he carried it out of the house that day,"
1519,SWORD BLADES,And kept it close beside him until night.
1520,SWORD BLADES,
1521,SWORD BLADES,And so it happened from day to day.
1522,SWORD BLADES,The old man fed his life
1523,SWORD BLADES,"On the beauty of his vase, on its perfect shape."
1524,SWORD BLADES,And his soul forgot its former strife.
1525,SWORD BLADES,
1526,SWORD BLADES,And the village-folk came and begged to see
1527,SWORD BLADES,The flagon which was dug from the ground.
1528,SWORD BLADES,"And the old man never thought of an oath, in his joy"
1529,SWORD BLADES,At showing what he had found.
1530,SWORD BLADES,
1531,SWORD BLADES,One day the master of the village school
1532,SWORD BLADES,"Passed him as he stooped at toil,"
1533,SWORD BLADES,"Hoeing for a bean-row, and at his side"
1534,SWORD BLADES,"Was the vase, on the turned-up soil."
1535,SWORD BLADES,
1536,SWORD BLADES,"""My friend,"" said the schoolmaster, pompous and kind,"
1537,SWORD BLADES,"""That's a valuable thing you have there,"
1538,SWORD BLADES,"But it might get broken out of doors,"
1539,SWORD BLADES,It should meet with the utmost care.
1540,SWORD BLADES,
1541,SWORD BLADES,"What are you doing with it out here?"""
1542,SWORD BLADES,"""Why, Sir,"" said the poor old man,"
1543,SWORD BLADES,"""I like to have it about, do you see?"
1544,SWORD BLADES,"To be with it all I can."""
1545,SWORD BLADES,
1546,SWORD BLADES,"""You will smash it,"" said the schoolmaster, sternly right,"
1547,SWORD BLADES,"""Mark my words and see!"""
1548,SWORD BLADES,"And he walked away, while the old man looked"
1549,SWORD BLADES,At his treasure despondingly.
1550,SWORD BLADES,
1551,SWORD BLADES,"Then he smiled to himself, for it was his!"
1552,SWORD BLADES,"He had toiled for it, and now he cared."
1553,SWORD BLADES,"Yes! loved its shape, and its subtle, swift hues,"
1554,SWORD BLADES,Which his own hard work had bared.
1555,SWORD BLADES,
1556,SWORD BLADES,"He would carry it round with him everywhere,"
1557,SWORD BLADES,As it gave him joy to do.
1558,SWORD BLADES,A fragile vase should not stand in a bean-row!
1559,SWORD BLADES,Who would dare to say so?  Who?
1560,SWORD BLADES,
1561,SWORD BLADES,"Then his heart was rested, and his fears gave way,"
1562,SWORD BLADES,And he bent to his hoe again....
1563,SWORD BLADES,"A clod rolled down, and his foot slipped back,"
1564,SWORD BLADES,And he lurched with a cry of pain.
1565,SWORD BLADES,
1566,SWORD BLADES,"For the blade of the hoe crashed into glass,"
1567,SWORD BLADES,And the vase fell to iridescent sherds.
1568,SWORD BLADES,"The old man's body heaved with slow, dry sobs."
1569,SWORD BLADES,"He did not curse, he had no words."
1570,SWORD BLADES,
1571,SWORD BLADES,"He gathered the fragments, one by one,"
1572,SWORD BLADES,And his fingers were cut and torn.
1573,SWORD BLADES,Then he made a hole in the very place
1574,SWORD BLADES,Whence the beautiful vase had been borne.
1575,SWORD BLADES,
1576,SWORD BLADES,"He covered the hole, and he patted it down,"
1577,SWORD BLADES,Then he hobbled to his house and shut the door.
1578,SWORD BLADES,He tore up his coat and nailed it at the windows
1579,SWORD BLADES,That no beam of light should cross the floor.
1580,SWORD BLADES,
1581,SWORD BLADES,"He sat down in front of the empty hearth,"
1582,SWORD BLADES,And he neither ate nor drank.
1583,SWORD BLADES,"In three days they found him, dead and cold,"
1584,SWORD BLADES,"And they said:  ""What a queer old crank!"""

1593,SWORD BLADES,"Have at you, you Devils!"
1594,SWORD BLADES,"My back's to this tree,"
1595,SWORD BLADES,For you're nothing so nice
1596,SWORD BLADES,That the hind-side of me
1597,SWORD BLADES,Would escape your assault.
1598,SWORD BLADES,"Come on now, all three!"
1599,SWORD BLADES,
1600,SWORD BLADES,"Here's a dandified gentleman,"
1601,SWORD BLADES,"Rapier at point,"
1602,SWORD BLADES,And a wrist which whirls round
1603,SWORD BLADES,Like a circular joint.
1604,SWORD BLADES,"A spatter of blood, man!"
1605,SWORD BLADES,That's just to anoint
1606,SWORD BLADES,
1607,SWORD BLADES,And make supple your limbs.
1608,SWORD BLADES,'Tis a pity the silk
1609,SWORD BLADES,Of your waistcoat is stained.
1610,SWORD BLADES,"Why!  Your heart's full of milk,"
1611,SWORD BLADES,"And so full, it spills over!"
1612,SWORD BLADES,I'm not of your ilk.
1613,SWORD BLADES,
1614,SWORD BLADES,"You said so, and laughed"
1615,SWORD BLADES,"At my old-fashioned hose,"
1616,SWORD BLADES,"At the cut of my hair,"
1617,SWORD BLADES,At the length of my nose.
1618,SWORD BLADES,To carve it to pattern
1619,SWORD BLADES,I think you propose.
1620,SWORD BLADES,
1621,SWORD BLADES,"Your pardon, young Sir,"
1622,SWORD BLADES,But my nose and my sword
1623,SWORD BLADES,Are proving themselves
1624,SWORD BLADES,In quite perfect accord.
1625,SWORD BLADES,I grieve to have spotted
1626,SWORD BLADES,Your shirt.  On my word!
1627,SWORD BLADES,
1628,SWORD BLADES,And hullo!  You Bully!
1629,SWORD BLADES,That blade's not a stick
1630,SWORD BLADES,"To slash right and left,"
1631,SWORD BLADES,And my skull is too thick
1632,SWORD BLADES,To be cleft with such cuffs
1633,SWORD BLADES,Of a sword.  Now a lick
1634,SWORD BLADES,
1635,SWORD BLADES,Down the side of your face.
1636,SWORD BLADES,"What a pretty, red line!"
1637,SWORD BLADES,Tell the taverns that scar
1638,SWORD BLADES,Was an honour.  Don't whine
1639,SWORD BLADES,That a stranger has marked you.
1640,SWORD BLADES,*    *    *    *    *
1641,SWORD BLADES,"The tree's there, You Swine!"
1642,SWORD BLADES,
1643,SWORD BLADES,Did you think to get in
1644,SWORD BLADES,"At the back, while your friends"
1645,SWORD BLADES,Made a little diversion
1646,SWORD BLADES,"In front?  So it ends,"
1647,SWORD BLADES,With your sword clattering down
1648,SWORD BLADES,On the ground.  'Tis amends
1649,SWORD BLADES,
1650,SWORD BLADES,I make for your courteous
1651,SWORD BLADES,"Reception of me,"
1652,SWORD BLADES,"A foreigner, landed"
1653,SWORD BLADES,From over the sea.
1654,SWORD BLADES,Your welcome was fervent
1655,SWORD BLADES,I think you'll agree.
1656,SWORD BLADES,
1657,SWORD BLADES,My shoes are not buckled
1658,SWORD BLADES,"With gold, nor my hair"
1659,SWORD BLADES,"Oiled and scented, my jacket's"
1660,SWORD BLADES,"Not satin, I wear"
1661,SWORD BLADES,"Corded breeches, wide hats,"
1662,SWORD BLADES,And I make people stare!
1663,SWORD BLADES,
1664,SWORD BLADES,"So I do, but my heart"
1665,SWORD BLADES,"Is the heart of a man,"
1666,SWORD BLADES,And my thoughts cannot twirl
1667,SWORD BLADES,In the limited span
1668,SWORD BLADES,"'Twixt my head and my heels,"
1669,SWORD BLADES,As some other men's can.
1670,SWORD BLADES,
1671,SWORD BLADES,I have business more strange
1672,SWORD BLADES,"Than the shape of my boots,"
1673,SWORD BLADES,And my interests range
1674,SWORD BLADES,"From the sky, to the roots"
1675,SWORD BLADES,"Of this dung-hill you live in,"
1676,SWORD BLADES,You half-rotted shoots
1677,SWORD BLADES,
1678,SWORD BLADES,Of a mouldering tree!
1679,SWORD BLADES,"Here's at you, once more."
1680,SWORD BLADES,You Apes!  You Jack-fools!
1681,SWORD BLADES,"You can show me the door,"
1682,SWORD BLADES,"And jeer at my ways,"
1683,SWORD BLADES,But you're pinked to the core.
1684,SWORD BLADES,
1685,SWORD BLADES,"And before I have done,"
1686,SWORD BLADES,I will prick my name in
1687,SWORD BLADES,"With the front of my steel,"
1688,SWORD BLADES,And your lily-white skin
1689,SWORD BLADES,Shall be printed with me.
1690,SWORD BLADES,For I've come here to win!

1701,SWORD BLADES,Chilled by the wind from the open window.
1702,SWORD BLADES,"Empty and void, it sparkles white in the moonlight."
1703,SWORD BLADES,The room is filled with the strange scent
1704,SWORD BLADES,Of wistaria blossoms.
1705,SWORD BLADES,They sway in the moon's radiance
1706,SWORD BLADES,And tap against the wall.
1707,SWORD BLADES,"But the cup of my heart is still,"
1708,SWORD BLADES,"And cold, and empty."
1709,SWORD BLADES,
1710,SWORD BLADES,"When you come, it brims"
1711,SWORD BLADES,"Red and trembling with blood,"
1712,SWORD BLADES,Heart's blood for your drinking;
1713,SWORD BLADES,To fill your mouth with love
1714,SWORD BLADES,And the bitter-sweet taste of a soul.

1724,SWORD BLADES,My words are little jars
1725,SWORD BLADES,For you to take and put upon a shelf.
1726,SWORD BLADES,"Their shapes are quaint and beautiful,"
1727,SWORD BLADES,And they have many pleasant colours and lustres
1728,SWORD BLADES,To recommend them.
1729,SWORD BLADES,Also the scent from them fills the room
1730,SWORD BLADES,With sweetness of flowers and crushed grasses.
1731,SWORD BLADES,
1732,SWORD BLADES,"When I shall have given you the last one,"
1733,SWORD BLADES,"You will have the whole of me,"
1734,SWORD BLADES,But I shall be dead.

1745,SWORD BLADES,"But when I go to warm my hands,"
1746,SWORD BLADES,"My clumsiness overturns the light,"
1747,SWORD BLADES,And then I stumble

1759,SWORD BLADES,"The dog is lying,"
1760,SWORD BLADES,Gazing at his Beloved.
1761,SWORD BLADES,"His eyes are wet and urgent,"
1762,SWORD BLADES,And his body is taut and shaking.
1763,SWORD BLADES,It is cold on the terrace;
1764,SWORD BLADES,"A pale wind licks along the stone slabs,"
1765,SWORD BLADES,But the dog gazes through the glass
1766,SWORD BLADES,And is content.
1767,SWORD BLADES,
1768,SWORD BLADES,The Beloved is writing a letter.
1769,SWORD BLADES,"Occasionally she speaks to the dog,"
1770,SWORD BLADES,But she is thinking of her writing.
1771,SWORD BLADES,"Does she, too, give her devotion to one"
1772,SWORD BLADES,Not worthy?

1783,SWORD BLADES,So sharp that the air would turn its edge
1784,SWORD BLADES,Were it to be twisted in flight.
1785,SWORD BLADES,"Licking passions have bitten their arabesques into it,"
1786,SWORD BLADES,"And the mark of them lies, in and out,"
1787,SWORD BLADES,"Worm-like,"
1788,SWORD BLADES,With the beauty of corroded copper patterning white steel.
1789,SWORD BLADES,"My brain is curved like a scimitar,"
1790,SWORD BLADES,And sighs at its cutting
1791,SWORD BLADES,Like a sickle mowing grass.
1792,SWORD BLADES,
1793,SWORD BLADES,But of what use is all this to me!
1794,SWORD BLADES,"I, who am set to crack stones"

1825,SWORD BLADES,I feared to walk down the street
1826,SWORD BLADES,"Lest I should reel with the wine of you,"
1827,SWORD BLADES,And jerk against my neighbours
1828,SWORD BLADES,As they go by.
1829,SWORD BLADES,"I am parched now, and my tongue is horrible in my mouth,"

1843,SWORD BLADES,"Cool, quiet, green stars."
1844,SWORD BLADES,"I will tear them out of the sky,"
1845,SWORD BLADES,"And squeeze them over an old silver cup,"
1846,SWORD BLADES,"And I will pour the cold scorn of my Beloved into it,"
1847,SWORD BLADES,So that my drink shall be bubbled with ice.
1848,SWORD BLADES,
1849,SWORD BLADES,It will lap and scratch
1850,SWORD BLADES,As I swallow it down;
1851,SWORD BLADES,"And I shall feel it as a serpent of fire,"
1852,SWORD BLADES,Coiling and twisting in my belly.
1853,SWORD BLADES,"His snortings will rise to my head,"

1867,SWORD BLADES,"Even so, I can see that it has red berries,"
1868,SWORD BLADES,"A scarlet fruit,"

1870,SWORD BLADES,"It seems as though the rain,"
1871,SWORD BLADES,"Dripping from it,"
1872,SWORD BLADES,Should be tinged with colour.
1873,SWORD BLADES,"I desire the berries,"

1889,SWORD BLADES,I would pour them upon you

1910,SWORD BLADES,"One after the other,"
1911,SWORD BLADES,"Wedge you away from me,"

1946,SWORD BLADES,Of Heaven it rose.  Its flickering tongues up-drew
1947,SWORD BLADES,And vanished in the sunshine.  How it came
1948,SWORD BLADES,"We guessed not, nor what thing could be its name."
1949,SWORD BLADES,From each to each had sprung those sparks which flew
1950,SWORD BLADES,Together into fire.  But we knew
1951,SWORD BLADES,The winds would slap and quench it in their game.
1952,SWORD BLADES,And so we graved and fashioned marble blocks

1954,SWORD BLADES,"With pillared porticos we wreathed the whole,"

1983,SWORD BLADES,"Streaks with a ghostly finger, and her sneer"
1984,SWORD BLADES,"Pulls at my lengthening shadow.  Yes, 'tis that!"
1985,SWORD BLADES,"My shadow stretches forward, and the ground"
1986,SWORD BLADES,Is dark in front because the light's behind.
1987,SWORD BLADES,"It is grotesque, with such a funny hat,"
1988,SWORD BLADES,In watching it and walking I have found
1989,SWORD BLADES,More than enough to occupy my mind.

2006,POPPY SEED,
2007,POPPY SEED,A yellow band of light upon the street
2008,POPPY SEED,"Pours from an open door, and makes a wide"
2009,POPPY SEED,Pathway of bright gold across a sheet
2010,POPPY SEED,Of calm and liquid moonshine.  From inside
2011,POPPY SEED,"Come shouts and streams of laughter, and a snatch"
2012,POPPY SEED,"Of song, soon drowned and lost again in mirth,"
2013,POPPY SEED,"The clip of tankards on a table top,"
2014,POPPY SEED,And stir of booted heels.  Against the patch
2015,POPPY SEED,"Of candle-light a shadow falls, its girth"
2016,POPPY SEED,"Proclaims the host himself, and master of his shop."
2017,POPPY SEED,

2020,POPPY SEED,
2021,POPPY SEED,"This is the tavern of one Hilverdink,"
2022,POPPY SEED,"Jan Hilverdink, whose wines are much esteemed."
2023,POPPY SEED,Within his cellar men can have to drink
2024,POPPY SEED,The rarest cordials old monks ever schemed
2025,POPPY SEED,"To coax from pulpy grapes, and with nice art"
2026,POPPY SEED,Improve and spice their virgin juiciness.
2027,POPPY SEED,"Here froths the amber beer of many a brew,"
2028,POPPY SEED,Crowning each pewter tankard with as smart
2029,POPPY SEED,A cap as ever in his wantonness
2030,POPPY SEED,Winter set glittering on top of an old yew.
2031,POPPY SEED,

2033,POPPY SEED,3
2034,POPPY SEED,
2035,POPPY SEED,"Tall candles stand upon the table, where"
2036,POPPY SEED,"Are twisted glasses, ruby-sparked with wine,"
2037,POPPY SEED,Clarets and ports.  Those topaz bumpers were
2038,POPPY SEED,"Drained from slim, long-necked bottles of the Rhine."
2039,POPPY SEED,"The centre of the board is piled with pipes,"
2040,POPPY SEED,"Slender and clean, the still unbaptized clay"
2041,POPPY SEED,"Awaits its burning fate.  Behind, the vault"
2042,POPPY SEED,"Stretches from dim to dark, a groping way"
2043,POPPY SEED,"Bordered by casks and puncheons, whose brass stripes"
2044,POPPY SEED,"And bands gleam dully still, beyond the gay tumult."
2045,POPPY SEED,
2046,POPPY SEED,
2047,POPPY SEED,4
2048,POPPY SEED,
2049,POPPY SEED,"""For good old Master Hilverdink, a toast!"""
2050,POPPY SEED,Clamoured a youth with tassels on his boots.
2051,POPPY SEED,"""Bring out your oldest brandy for a boast,"
2052,POPPY SEED,From that small barrel in the very roots
2053,POPPY SEED,"Of your deep cellar, man.  Why here is Max!"
2054,POPPY SEED,"Ho!  Welcome, Max, you're scarcely here in time."
2055,POPPY SEED,"We want to drink to old Jan's luck, and smoke"
2056,POPPY SEED,His best tobacco for a grand climax.
2057,POPPY SEED,"Here, Jan, a paper, fragrant as crushed thyme,"
2058,POPPY SEED,"We'll have the best to wish you luck, or may we choke!"""
2059,POPPY SEED,
2060,POPPY SEED,
2061,POPPY SEED,5
2062,POPPY SEED,
2063,POPPY SEED,"Max Breuck unclasped his broadcloth cloak, and sat."
2064,POPPY SEED,"""Well thought of, Franz; here's luck to Mynheer Jan."""
2065,POPPY SEED,The host set down a jar; then to a vat
2066,POPPY SEED,"Lost in the distance of his cellar, ran."
2067,POPPY SEED,Max took a pipe as graceful as the stem
2068,POPPY SEED,"Of some long tulip, crammed it full, and drew"
2069,POPPY SEED,The pungent smoke deep to his grateful lung.
2070,POPPY SEED,It curled all blue throughout the cave and flew
2071,POPPY SEED,Into the silver night.  At once there flung
2072,POPPY SEED,"Into the crowded shop a boy, who cried to them:"
2073,POPPY SEED,
2074,POPPY SEED,
2075,POPPY SEED,6
2076,POPPY SEED,
2077,POPPY SEED,"""Oh, sirs, is there some learned lawyer here,"
2078,POPPY SEED,"Some advocate, or all-wise counsellor?"
2079,POPPY SEED,My master sent me to inquire where
2080,POPPY SEED,"Such men do mostly be, but every door"
2081,POPPY SEED,"Was shut and barred, for late has grown the hour."
2082,POPPY SEED,I pray you tell me where I may now find
2083,POPPY SEED,"One versed in law, the matter will not wait."""
2084,POPPY SEED,"""I am a lawyer, boy,"" said Max, ""my mind"
2085,POPPY SEED,"Is not locked to my business, though 'tis late."
2086,POPPY SEED,I shall be glad to serve what way is in my power.
2087,POPPY SEED,
2088,POPPY SEED,
2089,POPPY SEED,7
2090,POPPY SEED,
2091,POPPY SEED,"Then once more, cloaked and ready, he set out,"
2092,POPPY SEED,Tripping the footsteps of the eager boy
2093,POPPY SEED,"Along the dappled cobbles, while the rout"
2094,POPPY SEED,Within the tavern jeered at his employ.
2095,POPPY SEED,"Through new-burst elm leaves filtered the white moon,"
2096,POPPY SEED,"Who peered and splashed between the twinkling boughs,"
2097,POPPY SEED,"Flooded the open spaces, and took flight"
2098,POPPY SEED,"Before tall, serried houses in platoon,"
2099,POPPY SEED,Guarded by shadows.  Past the Custom House
2100,POPPY SEED,They took their hurried way in the Spring-scented night.
2101,POPPY SEED,
2102,POPPY SEED,
2103,POPPY SEED,8
2104,POPPY SEED,
2105,POPPY SEED,Before a door which fronted a canal
2106,POPPY SEED,The boy halted.  A dim tree-shaded spot.
2107,POPPY SEED,The water lapped the stones in musical
2108,POPPY SEED,"And rhythmic tappings, and a galliot"
2109,POPPY SEED,Slumbered at anchor with no light aboard.
2110,POPPY SEED,"The boy knocked twice, and steps approached.  A flame"
2111,POPPY SEED,"Winked through the keyhole, then a key was turned,"
2112,POPPY SEED,And through the open door Max went toward
2113,POPPY SEED,"Another door, whence sound of voices came."
2114,POPPY SEED,He entered a large room where candelabra burned.
2115,POPPY SEED,
2116,POPPY SEED,
2117,POPPY SEED,9
2118,POPPY SEED,
2119,POPPY SEED,An aged man in quilted dressing gown
2120,POPPY SEED,"Rose up to greet him.  ""Sir,"" said Max, ""you sent"
2121,POPPY SEED,Your messenger to seek throughout the town
2122,POPPY SEED,"A lawyer.  I have small accomplishment,"
2123,POPPY SEED,"But I am at your service, and my name"
2124,POPPY SEED,"Is Max Breuck, Counsellor, at your command."""
2125,POPPY SEED,"""Mynheer,"" replied the aged man, ""obliged"
2126,POPPY SEED,"Am I, and count myself much privileged."
2127,POPPY SEED,"I am Cornelius Kurler, and my fame"
2128,POPPY SEED,Is better known on distant oceans than on land.
2129,POPPY SEED,
2130,POPPY SEED,
2131,POPPY SEED,10
2132,POPPY SEED,
2133,POPPY SEED,"My ship has tasted water in strange seas,"
2134,POPPY SEED,And bartered goods at still uncharted isles.
2135,POPPY SEED,"She's oft coquetted with a tropic breeze,"
2136,POPPY SEED,"And sheered off hurricanes with jaunty smiles."""
2137,POPPY SEED,"""Tush, Kurler,"" here broke in the other man,"
2138,POPPY SEED,"""Enough of poetry, draw the deed and sign."""
2139,POPPY SEED,"The old man seemed to wizen at the voice,"
2140,POPPY SEED,"""My good friend, Grootver,--"" he at once began."
2141,POPPY SEED,"""No introductions, let us have some wine,"
2142,POPPY SEED,"And business, now that you at last have made your choice."""
2143,POPPY SEED,
2144,POPPY SEED,
2145,POPPY SEED,11
2146,POPPY SEED,
2147,POPPY SEED,"A harsh and disagreeable man he proved to be,"
2148,POPPY SEED,"This Grootver, with no single kindly thought."
2149,POPPY SEED,"Kurler explained, his old hands nervously"
2150,POPPY SEED,Twisting his beard.  His vessel he had bought
2151,POPPY SEED,From Grootver.  He had thought to soon repay
2152,POPPY SEED,"The ducats borrowed, but an adverse wind"
2153,POPPY SEED,Had so delayed him that his cargo brought
2154,POPPY SEED,"But half its proper price, the very day"
2155,POPPY SEED,He came to port he stepped ashore to find
2156,POPPY SEED,The market glutted and his counted profits naught.
2157,POPPY SEED,
2158,POPPY SEED,
2159,POPPY SEED,12
2160,POPPY SEED,
2161,POPPY SEED,Little by little Max made out the way
2162,POPPY SEED,That Grootver pressed that poor harassed old man.
2163,POPPY SEED,"His money he must have, too long delay"
2164,POPPY SEED,Had turned the usurer to a ruffian.
2165,POPPY SEED,"""But let me take my ship, with many bales"
2166,POPPY SEED,"Of cotton stuffs dyed crimson, green, and blue,"
2167,POPPY SEED,"Cunningly patterned, made to suit the taste"
2168,POPPY SEED,Of mandarin's ladies; when my battered sails
2169,POPPY SEED,"Open for home, such stores will I bring you"
2170,POPPY SEED,That all your former ventures will be counted waste.
2171,POPPY SEED,
2172,POPPY SEED,
2173,POPPY SEED,13
2174,POPPY SEED,
2175,POPPY SEED,"Such light and foamy silks, like crinkled cream,"
2176,POPPY SEED,"And indigo more blue than sun-whipped seas,"
2177,POPPY SEED,"Spices and fragrant trees, a massive beam"
2178,POPPY SEED,"Of sandalwood, and pungent China teas,"
2179,POPPY SEED,"Tobacco, coffee!""  Grootver only laughed."
2180,POPPY SEED,"Max heard it all, and worse than all he heard"
2181,POPPY SEED,The deed to which the sailor gave his word.
2182,POPPY SEED,"He shivered, 'twas as if the villain gaffed"
2183,POPPY SEED,"The old man with a boat-hook; bleeding, spent,"
2184,POPPY SEED,He begged for life nor knew at all the road he went.
2185,POPPY SEED,
2186,POPPY SEED,
2187,POPPY SEED,14
2188,POPPY SEED,
2189,POPPY SEED,"For Kurler had a daughter, young and gay,"
2190,POPPY SEED,"Carefully reared and shielded, rarely seen."
2191,POPPY SEED,But on one black and most unfriendly day
2192,POPPY SEED,Grootver had caught her as she passed between
2193,POPPY SEED,The kitchen and the garden.  She had run
2194,POPPY SEED,"In fear of him, his evil leering eye,"
2195,POPPY SEED,"And when he came she, bolted in her room,"
2196,POPPY SEED,"Refused to show, though gave no reason why."
2197,POPPY SEED,"The spinning of her future had begun,"
2198,POPPY SEED,On quiet nights she heard the whirring of her doom.
2199,POPPY SEED,
2200,POPPY SEED,
2201,POPPY SEED,15
2202,POPPY SEED,
2203,POPPY SEED,"Max mended an old goosequill by the fire,"
2204,POPPY SEED,"Loathing his work, but seeing no thing to do."
2205,POPPY SEED,He felt his hands were building up the pyre
2206,POPPY SEED,"To burn two souls, and seized with vertigo"
2207,POPPY SEED,He staggered to his chair.  Before him lay
2208,POPPY SEED,White paper still unspotted by a crime.
2209,POPPY SEED,"""Now, young man, write,"" said Grootver in his ear."
2210,POPPY SEED,"""`If in two years my vessel should yet stay"
2211,POPPY SEED,"From Amsterdam, I give Grootver, sometime"
2212,POPPY SEED,"A friend, my daughter for his lawful wife.'  Now swear."""
2213,POPPY SEED,
2214,POPPY SEED,
2215,POPPY SEED,16
2216,POPPY SEED,
2217,POPPY SEED,"And Kurler swore, a palsied, tottering sound,"
2218,POPPY SEED,"And traced his name, a shaking, wandering line."
2219,POPPY SEED,"Then dazed he sat there, speechless from his wound."
2220,POPPY SEED,"Grootver got up:  ""Fair voyage, the brigantine!"""
2221,POPPY SEED,"He shuffled from the room, and left the house."
2222,POPPY SEED,His footsteps wore to silence down the street.
2223,POPPY SEED,At last the aged man began to rouse.
2224,POPPY SEED,With help he once more gained his trembling feet.
2225,POPPY SEED,"""My daughter, Mynheer Breuck, is friendless now."
2226,POPPY SEED,"Will you watch over her?  I ask a solemn vow."""
2227,POPPY SEED,
2228,POPPY SEED,
2229,POPPY SEED,17
2230,POPPY SEED,
2231,POPPY SEED,"Max laid his hand upon the old man's arm,"
2232,POPPY SEED,"""Before God, sir, I vow, when you are gone,"
2233,POPPY SEED,So to protect your daughter from all harm
2234,POPPY SEED,"As one man may.""  Thus sorrowful, forlorn,"
2235,POPPY SEED,"The situation to Max Breuck appeared,"
2236,POPPY SEED,"He gave his promise almost without thought,"
2237,POPPY SEED,"Nor looked to see a difficulty.  ""Bred"
2238,POPPY SEED,Gently to watch a mother left alone;
2239,POPPY SEED,"Bound by a dying father's wish, who feared"
2240,POPPY SEED,The world's accustomed harshness when he should be dead;
2241,POPPY SEED,
2242,POPPY SEED,
2243,POPPY SEED,18
2244,POPPY SEED,
2245,POPPY SEED,"Such was my case from youth, Mynheer Kurler."
2246,POPPY SEED,"Last Winter she died also, and my days"
2247,POPPY SEED,"Are passed in work, lest I should grieve for her,"
2248,POPPY SEED,And undo habits used to earn her praise.
2249,POPPY SEED,My leisure I will gladly give to see
2250,POPPY SEED,"Your household and your daughter prosperous."""
2251,POPPY SEED,"The sailor said his thanks, but turned away."
2252,POPPY SEED,"He could not brook that his humility,"
2253,POPPY SEED,"So little wonted, and so tremulous,"
2254,POPPY SEED,Should first before a stranger make such great display.
2255,POPPY SEED,
2256,POPPY SEED,
2257,POPPY SEED,19
2258,POPPY SEED,
2259,POPPY SEED,"""Come here to-morrow as the bells ring noon,"
2260,POPPY SEED,"I sail at the full sea, my daughter then"
2261,POPPY SEED,I will make known to you.  'Twill be a boon
2262,POPPY SEED,"If after I have bid good-by, and when"
2263,POPPY SEED,"Her eyeballs scorch with watching me depart,"
2264,POPPY SEED,You bring her home again.  She lives with one
2265,POPPY SEED,"Old serving-woman, who has brought her up."
2266,POPPY SEED,But that is no friend for so free a heart.
2267,POPPY SEED,No head to match her questions.  It is done.
2268,POPPY SEED,And I must sail away to come and brim her cup.
2269,POPPY SEED,
2270,POPPY SEED,
2271,POPPY SEED,20
2272,POPPY SEED,
2273,POPPY SEED,My ship's the fastest that owns Amsterdam
2274,POPPY SEED,"As home, so not a letter can you send."
2275,POPPY SEED,"I shall be back, before to where I am"
2276,POPPY SEED,"Another ship could reach.  Now your stipend--"""
2277,POPPY SEED,"Quickly Breuck interposed.  ""When you once more"
2278,POPPY SEED,Tread on the stones which pave our streets.--Good night!
2279,POPPY SEED,"To-morrow I will be, at stroke of noon,"
2280,POPPY SEED,"At the great wharf.""  Then hurrying, in spite"
2281,POPPY SEED,Of cake and wine the old man pressed upon
2282,POPPY SEED,"Him ere he went, he took his leave and shut the door."
2283,POPPY SEED,
2284,POPPY SEED,
2285,POPPY SEED,21
2286,POPPY SEED,
2287,POPPY SEED,"'Twas noon in Amsterdam, the day was clear,"
2288,POPPY SEED,And sunshine tipped the pointed roofs with gold.
2289,POPPY SEED,"The brown canals ran liquid bronze, for here"
2290,POPPY SEED,The sun sank deep into the waters cold.
2291,POPPY SEED,And every clock and belfry in the town
2292,POPPY SEED,"Hammered, and struck, and rang.  Such peals of bells,"
2293,POPPY SEED,"To shake the sunny morning into life,"
2294,POPPY SEED,"And to proclaim the middle, and the crown,"
2295,POPPY SEED,"Of this most sparkling daytime!  The crowd swells,"
2296,POPPY SEED,Laughing and pushing toward the quays in friendly strife.
2297,POPPY SEED,
2298,POPPY SEED,
2299,POPPY SEED,22
2300,POPPY SEED,
2301,POPPY SEED,"The ""Horn of Fortune"" sails away to-day."
2302,POPPY SEED,"At highest tide she lets her anchor go,"
2303,POPPY SEED,And starts for China.  Saucy popinjay!
2304,POPPY SEED,"Giddy in freshest paint she curtseys low,"
2305,POPPY SEED,And beckons to her boats to let her start.
2306,POPPY SEED,"Blue is the ocean, with a flashing breeze."
2307,POPPY SEED,The shining waves are quick to take her part.
2308,POPPY SEED,"They push and spatter her.  Her sails are loose,"
2309,POPPY SEED,"Her tackles hanging, waiting men to seize"
2310,POPPY SEED,"And haul them taut, with chanty-singing, as they choose."
2311,POPPY SEED,
2312,POPPY SEED,
2313,POPPY SEED,23
2314,POPPY SEED,
2315,POPPY SEED,"At the great wharf's edge Mynheer Kurler stands,"
2316,POPPY SEED,"And by his side, his daughter, young Christine."
2317,POPPY SEED,"Max Breuck is there, his hat held in his hands,"
2318,POPPY SEED,Bowing before them both.  The brigantine
2319,POPPY SEED,"Bounces impatient at the long delay,"
2320,POPPY SEED,"Curvets and jumps, a cable's length from shore."
2321,POPPY SEED,A heavy galliot unloads on the walls
2322,POPPY SEED,"Round, yellow cheeses, like gold cannon balls"
2323,POPPY SEED,Stacked on the stones in pyramids.  Once more
2324,POPPY SEED,"Kurler has kissed Christine, and now he is away."
2325,POPPY SEED,
2326,POPPY SEED,
2327,POPPY SEED,24
2328,POPPY SEED,
2329,POPPY SEED,"Christine stood rigid like a frozen stone,"
2330,POPPY SEED,Her hands wrung pale in effort at control.
2331,POPPY SEED,"Max moved aside and let her be alone,"
2332,POPPY SEED,For grief exacts each penny of its toll.
2333,POPPY SEED,The dancing boat tossed on the glinting sea.
2334,POPPY SEED,"A sun-path swallowed it in flaming light,"
2335,POPPY SEED,"Then, shrunk a cockleshell, it came again"
2336,POPPY SEED,Upon the other side.  Now on the lee
2337,POPPY SEED,"It took the ""Horn of Fortune"".  Straining sight"
2338,POPPY SEED,"Could see it hauled aboard, men pulling on the crane."
2339,POPPY SEED,
2340,POPPY SEED,
2341,POPPY SEED,25
2342,POPPY SEED,
2343,POPPY SEED,"Then up above the eager brigantine,"
2344,POPPY SEED,"Along her slender masts, the sails took flight,"
2345,POPPY SEED,"Were sheeted home, and ropes were coiled.  The shine"
2346,POPPY SEED,"Of the wet anchor, when its heavy weight"
2347,POPPY SEED,"Rose splashing to the deck.  These things they saw,"
2348,POPPY SEED,"Christine and Max, upon the crowded quay."
2349,POPPY SEED,"They saw the sails grow white, then blue in shade,"
2350,POPPY SEED,"The ship had turned, caught in a windy flaw"
2351,POPPY SEED,"She glided imperceptibly away,"
2352,POPPY SEED,Drew farther off and in the bright sky seemed to fade.
2353,POPPY SEED,
2354,POPPY SEED,
2355,POPPY SEED,26
2356,POPPY SEED,
2357,POPPY SEED,"Home, through the emptying streets, Max took Christine,"
2358,POPPY SEED,Who would have hid her sorrow from his gaze.
2359,POPPY SEED,"Before the iron gateway, clasped between"
2360,POPPY SEED,"Each garden wall, he stopped.  She, in amaze,"
2361,POPPY SEED,"Asked, ""Do you enter not then, Mynheer Breuck?"
2362,POPPY SEED,My father told me of your courtesy.
2363,POPPY SEED,"Since I am now your charge, 'tis meet for me"
2364,POPPY SEED,"To show such hospitality as maiden may,"
2365,POPPY SEED,Without disdaining rules must not be broke.
2366,POPPY SEED,"Katrina will have coffee, and she bakes today."""
2367,POPPY SEED,
2368,POPPY SEED,
2369,POPPY SEED,27
2370,POPPY SEED,
2371,POPPY SEED,"She straight unhasped the tall, beflowered gate."
2372,POPPY SEED,"Curled into tendrils, twisted into cones"
2373,POPPY SEED,"Of leaves and roses, iron infoliate,"
2374,POPPY SEED,"It guards the pleasance, and its stiffened bones"
2375,POPPY SEED,"Are budded with much peering at the rows,"
2376,POPPY SEED,"And beds, and arbours, which it keeps inside."
2377,POPPY SEED,"Max started at the beauty, at the glare"
2378,POPPY SEED,Of tints.  At either end was set a wide
2379,POPPY SEED,"Path strewn with fine, red gravel, and such shows"
2380,POPPY SEED,Of tulips in their splendour flaunted everywhere!
2381,POPPY SEED,
2382,POPPY SEED,
2383,POPPY SEED,28
2384,POPPY SEED,
2385,POPPY SEED,"From side to side, midway each path, there ran"
2386,POPPY SEED,A longer one which cut the space in two.
2387,POPPY SEED,"And, like a tunnel some magician"
2388,POPPY SEED,"Has wrought in twinkling green, an alley grew,"
2389,POPPY SEED,Pleached thick and walled with apple trees; their flowers
2390,POPPY SEED,"Incensed the garden, and when Autumn came"
2391,POPPY SEED,The plump and heavy apples crowding stood
2392,POPPY SEED,And tapped against the arbour.  Then the dame
2393,POPPY SEED,"Katrina shook them down, in pelting showers"
2394,POPPY SEED,"They plunged to earth, and died transformed to sugared food."
2395,POPPY SEED,
2396,POPPY SEED,
2397,POPPY SEED,29
2398,POPPY SEED,
2399,POPPY SEED,"Against the high, encircling walls were grapes,"
2400,POPPY SEED,Nailed close to feel the baking of the sun
2401,POPPY SEED,From glowing bricks.  Their microscopic shapes
2402,POPPY SEED,Half hidden by serrated leaves.  And one
2403,POPPY SEED,Old cherry tossed its branches near the door.
2404,POPPY SEED,"Bordered along the wall, in beds between,"
2405,POPPY SEED,"Flickering, streaming, nodding in the air,"
2406,POPPY SEED,"The pride of all the garden, there were more"
2407,POPPY SEED,Tulips than Max had ever dreamed or seen.
2408,POPPY SEED,"They jostled, mobbed, and danced.  Max stood at helpless stare."
2409,POPPY SEED,
2410,POPPY SEED,
2411,POPPY SEED,30
2412,POPPY SEED,
2413,POPPY SEED,"""Within the arbour, Mynheer Breuck, I'll bring"
2414,POPPY SEED,"Coffee and cakes, a pipe, and Father's best"
2415,POPPY SEED,"Tobacco, brought from countries harbouring"
2416,POPPY SEED,"Dawn's earliest footstep.  Wait.""  With girlish zest"
2417,POPPY SEED,To please her guest she flew.  A moment more
2418,POPPY SEED,"She came again, with her old nurse behind."
2419,POPPY SEED,"Then, sitting on the bench and knitting fast,"
2420,POPPY SEED,She talked as someone with a noble store
2421,POPPY SEED,"Of hidden fancies, blown upon the wind,"
2422,POPPY SEED,Eager to flutter forth and leave their silent past.
2423,POPPY SEED,
2424,POPPY SEED,
2425,POPPY SEED,31
2426,POPPY SEED,
2427,POPPY SEED,The little apple leaves above their heads
2428,POPPY SEED,"Let fall a quivering sunshine.  Quiet, cool,"
2429,POPPY SEED,"In blossomed boughs they sat.  Beyond, the beds"
2430,POPPY SEED,"Of tulips blazed, a proper vestibule"
2431,POPPY SEED,And antechamber to the rainbow.  Dyes
2432,POPPY SEED,Of prismed richness:  Carmine.  Madder.  Blues
2433,POPPY SEED,Tinging dark browns to purple.  Silvers flushed
2434,POPPY SEED,To amethyst and tinct with gold.  Round eyes
2435,POPPY SEED,"Of scarlet, spotting tender saffron hues."
2436,POPPY SEED,"Violets sunk to blacks, and reds in orange crushed."
2437,POPPY SEED,
2438,POPPY SEED,
2439,POPPY SEED,32
2440,POPPY SEED,
2441,POPPY SEED,Of every pattern and in every shade.
2442,POPPY SEED,"Nacreous, iridescent, mottled, checked."
2443,POPPY SEED,"Some purest sulphur-yellow, others made"
2444,POPPY SEED,An ivory-white with disks of copper flecked.
2445,POPPY SEED,"Sprinkled and striped, tasselled, or keenest edged."
2446,POPPY SEED,"Striated, powdered, freckled, long or short."
2447,POPPY SEED,"They bloomed, and seemed strange wonder-moths new-fledged,"
2448,POPPY SEED,Born of the spectrum wedded to a flame.
2449,POPPY SEED,The shade within the arbour made a port
2450,POPPY SEED,"To o'ertaxed eyes, its still, green twilight rest became."
2451,POPPY SEED,
2452,POPPY SEED,
2453,POPPY SEED,33
2454,POPPY SEED,
2455,POPPY SEED,"Her knitting-needles clicked and Christine talked,"
2456,POPPY SEED,"This child matured to woman unaware,"
2457,POPPY SEED,The first time left alone.  Now dreams once balked
2458,POPPY SEED,Found utterance.  Max thought her very fair.
2459,POPPY SEED,"Beneath her cap her ornaments shone gold,"
2460,POPPY SEED,And purest gold they were.  Kurler was rich
2461,POPPY SEED,And heedful.  Her old maiden aunt had died
2462,POPPY SEED,"Whose darling care she was.  Now, growing bold,"
2463,POPPY SEED,"She asked, had Max a sister?  Dropped a stitch"
2464,POPPY SEED,At her own candour.  Then she paused and softly sighed.
2465,POPPY SEED,
2466,POPPY SEED,
2467,POPPY SEED,34
2468,POPPY SEED,
2469,POPPY SEED,"Two years was long!  She loved her father well,"
2470,POPPY SEED,But fears she had not.  He had always been
2471,POPPY SEED,Just sailed or sailing.  And she must not dwell
2472,POPPY SEED,"On sad thoughts, he had told her so, and seen"
2473,POPPY SEED,Her smile at parting.  But she sighed once more.
2474,POPPY SEED,Two years was long; 'twas not one hour yet!
2475,POPPY SEED,Mynheer Grootver she would not see at all.
2476,POPPY SEED,"Yes, yes, she knew, but ere the date so set,"
2477,POPPY SEED,"The ""Horn of Fortune"" would be at the wall."
2478,POPPY SEED,"When Max had bid farewell, she watched him from the door."
2479,POPPY SEED,
2480,POPPY SEED,
2481,POPPY SEED,35
2482,POPPY SEED,
2483,POPPY SEED,"The next day, and the next, Max went to ask"
2484,POPPY SEED,"The health of Jufvrouw Kurler, and the news:"
2485,POPPY SEED,"Another tulip blown, or the great task"
2486,POPPY SEED,Of gathering petals which the high wind strews;
2487,POPPY SEED,"The polishing of floors, the pictured tiles"
2488,POPPY SEED,"Well scrubbed, and oaken chairs most deftly oiled."
2489,POPPY SEED,"Such things were Christine's world, and his was she"
2490,POPPY SEED,"Winter drew near, his sun was in her smiles."
2491,POPPY SEED,"Another Spring, and at his law he toiled,"
2492,POPPY SEED,Unspoken hope counselled a wise efficiency.
2493,POPPY SEED,
2494,POPPY SEED,
2495,POPPY SEED,36
2496,POPPY SEED,
2497,POPPY SEED,"Max Breuck was honour's soul, he knew himself"
2498,POPPY SEED,"The guardian of this girl; no more, no less."
2499,POPPY SEED,As one in charge of guineas on a shelf
2500,POPPY SEED,"Loose in a china teapot, may confess"
2501,POPPY SEED,"His need, but may not borrow till his friend"
2502,POPPY SEED,"Comes back to give.  So Max, in honour, said"
2503,POPPY SEED,No word of love or marriage; but the days
2504,POPPY SEED,He clipped off on his almanac.  The end
2505,POPPY SEED,"Must come!  The second year, with feet of lead,"
2506,POPPY SEED,Lagged slowly by till Spring had plumped the willow sprays.
2507,POPPY SEED,
2508,POPPY SEED,
2509,POPPY SEED,37
2510,POPPY SEED,
2511,POPPY SEED,"Two years had made Christine a woman grown,"
2512,POPPY SEED,With dignity and gently certain pride.
2513,POPPY SEED,"But all her childhood fancies had not flown,"
2514,POPPY SEED,Her thoughts in lovely dreamings seemed to glide.
2515,POPPY SEED,"Max was her trusted friend, did she confess"
2516,POPPY SEED,A closer happiness?  Max could not tell.
2517,POPPY SEED,Two years were over and his life he found
2518,POPPY SEED,Sphered and complete.  In restless eagerness
2519,POPPY SEED,"He waited for the ""Horn of Fortune"".  Well"
2520,POPPY SEED,"Had he his promise kept, abating not one pound."
2521,POPPY SEED,
2522,POPPY SEED,
2523,POPPY SEED,38
2524,POPPY SEED,
2525,POPPY SEED,Spring slipped away to Summer.  Still no glass
2526,POPPY SEED,Sighted the brigantine.  Then Grootver came
2527,POPPY SEED,Demanding Jufvrouw Kurler.  His trespass
2528,POPPY SEED,"Was justified, for he had won the game."
2529,POPPY SEED,"Christine begged time, more time!  Midsummer went,"
2530,POPPY SEED,And Grootver waxed impatient.  Still the ship
2531,POPPY SEED,"Tarried.  Christine, betrayed and weary, sank"
2532,POPPY SEED,"To dreadful terrors.  One day, crazed, she sent"
2533,POPPY SEED,"For Max.  ""Come quickly,"" said her note, ""I skip"
2534,POPPY SEED,"The worst distress until we meet.  The world is blank."""
2535,POPPY SEED,
2536,POPPY SEED,
2537,POPPY SEED,39
2538,POPPY SEED,
2539,POPPY SEED,Through the long sunshine of late afternoon
2540,POPPY SEED,"Max went to her.  In the pleached alley, lost"
2541,POPPY SEED,"In bitter reverie, he found her soon."
2542,POPPY SEED,"And sitting down beside her, at the cost"
2543,POPPY SEED,"Of all his secret, ""Dear,"" said he, ""what thing"
2544,POPPY SEED,"So suddenly has happened?""  Then, in tears,"
2545,POPPY SEED,"She told that Grootver, on the following morn,"
2546,POPPY SEED,"Would come to marry her, and shuddering:"
2547,POPPY SEED,"""I will die rather, death has lesser fears."""
2548,POPPY SEED,Max felt the shackles drop from the oath which he had sworn.
2549,POPPY SEED,
2550,POPPY SEED,
2551,POPPY SEED,40
2552,POPPY SEED,
2553,POPPY SEED,"""My Dearest One, the hid joy of my heart!"
2554,POPPY SEED,"I love you, oh! you must indeed have known."
2555,POPPY SEED,In strictest honour I have played my part;
2556,POPPY SEED,But all this misery has overthrown
2557,POPPY SEED,"My scruples.  If you love me, marry me"
2558,POPPY SEED,Before the sun has dipped behind those trees.
2559,POPPY SEED,"You cannot be wed twice, and Grootver, foiled,"
2560,POPPY SEED,Can eat his anger.  My care it shall be
2561,POPPY SEED,"To pay your father's debt, by such degrees"
2562,POPPY SEED,"As I can compass, and for years I've greatly toiled."
2563,POPPY SEED,
2564,POPPY SEED,
2565,POPPY SEED,41
2566,POPPY SEED,
2567,POPPY SEED,"This is not haste, Christine, for long I've known"
2568,POPPY SEED,"My love, and silence forced upon my lips."
2569,POPPY SEED,I worship you with all the strength I've shown
2570,POPPY SEED,"In keeping faith.""  With pleading finger tips"
2571,POPPY SEED,"He touched her arm.  ""Christine!  Beloved!  Think."
2572,POPPY SEED,"Let us not tempt the future.  Dearest, speak,"
2573,POPPY SEED,I love you.  Do my words fall too swift now?
2574,POPPY SEED,"They've been in leash so long upon the brink."""
2575,POPPY SEED,"She sat quite still, her body loose and weak."
2576,POPPY SEED,"Then into him she melted, all her soul at flow."
2577,POPPY SEED,
2578,POPPY SEED,
2579,POPPY SEED,42
2580,POPPY SEED,
2581,POPPY SEED,And they were married ere the westering sun
2582,POPPY SEED,Had disappeared behind the garden trees.
2583,POPPY SEED,"The evening poured on them its benison,"
2584,POPPY SEED,"And flower-scents, that only night-time frees,"
2585,POPPY SEED,"Rose up around them from the beamy ground,"
2586,POPPY SEED,Silvered and shadowed by a tranquil moon.
2587,POPPY SEED,"Within the arbour, long they lay embraced,"
2588,POPPY SEED,In such enraptured sweetness as they found
2589,POPPY SEED,"Close-partnered each to each, and thinking soon"
2590,POPPY SEED,"To be enwoven, long ere night to morning faced."
2591,POPPY SEED,
2592,POPPY SEED,
2593,POPPY SEED,43
2594,POPPY SEED,
2595,POPPY SEED,"At last Max spoke, ""Dear Heart, this night is ours,"
2596,POPPY SEED,"To watch it pale, together, into dawn,"
2597,POPPY SEED,Pressing our souls apart like opening flowers
2598,POPPY SEED,"Until our lives, through quivering bodies drawn,"
2599,POPPY SEED,"Are mingled and confounded.  Then, far spent,"
2600,POPPY SEED,Our eyes will close to undisturbed rest.
2601,POPPY SEED,For that desired thing I leave you now.
2602,POPPY SEED,"To pinnacle this day's accomplishment,"
2603,POPPY SEED,By telling Grootver that a bootless quest
2604,POPPY SEED,"Is his, and that his schemes have met a knock-down blow."""
2605,POPPY SEED,
2606,POPPY SEED,
2607,POPPY SEED,44
2608,POPPY SEED,
2609,POPPY SEED,"But Christine clung to him with sobbing cries,"
2610,POPPY SEED,Pleading for love's sake that he leave her not.
2611,POPPY SEED,And wound her arms about his knees and thighs
2612,POPPY SEED,"As he stood over her.  With dread, begot"
2613,POPPY SEED,"Of Grootver's name, and silence, and the night,"
2614,POPPY SEED,She shook and trembled.  Words in moaning plaint
2615,POPPY SEED,"Wooed him to stay.  She feared, she knew not why,"
2616,POPPY SEED,Yet greatly feared.  She seemed some anguished saint
2617,POPPY SEED,Martyred by visions.  Max Breuck soothed her fright
2618,POPPY SEED,"With wisdom, then stepped out under the cooling sky."
2619,POPPY SEED,
2620,POPPY SEED,
2621,POPPY SEED,45
2622,POPPY SEED,
2623,POPPY SEED,But at the gate once more she held him close
2624,POPPY SEED,And quenched her heart again upon his lips.
2625,POPPY SEED,"""My Sweetheart, why this terror?  I propose"
2626,POPPY SEED,But to be gone one hour!  Evening slips
2627,POPPY SEED,"Away, this errand must be done.""  ""Max!  Max!"
2628,POPPY SEED,"First goes my father, if I lose you now!"""
2629,POPPY SEED,She grasped him as in panic lest she drown.
2630,POPPY SEED,"Softly he laughed, ""One hour through the town"
2631,POPPY SEED,By moonlight!  That's no place for foul attacks.
2632,POPPY SEED,"Dearest, be comforted, and clear that troubled brow."
2633,POPPY SEED,
2634,POPPY SEED,
2635,POPPY SEED,46
2636,POPPY SEED,
2637,POPPY SEED,"One hour, Dear, and then, no more alone."
2638,POPPY SEED,We front another day as man and wife.
2639,POPPY SEED,"I shall be back almost before I'm gone,"
2640,POPPY SEED,"And midnight shall anoint and crown our life."""
2641,POPPY SEED,Then through the gate he passed.  Along the street
2642,POPPY SEED,She watched his buttons gleaming in the moon.
2643,POPPY SEED,He stopped to wave and turned the garden wall.
2644,POPPY SEED,Straight she sank down upon a mossy seat.
2645,POPPY SEED,"Her senses, mist-encircled by a swoon,"
2646,POPPY SEED,Swayed to unconsciousness beneath its wreathing pall.
2647,POPPY SEED,
2648,POPPY SEED,
2649,POPPY SEED,47
2650,POPPY SEED,
2651,POPPY SEED,Briskly Max walked beside the still canal.
2652,POPPY SEED,His step was firm with purpose.  Not a jot
2653,POPPY SEED,"He feared this meeting, nor the rancorous gall"
2654,POPPY SEED,Grootver would spit on him who marred his plot.
2655,POPPY SEED,"He dreaded no man, since he could protect"
2656,POPPY SEED,Christine.  His wife!  He stopped and laughed aloud.
2657,POPPY SEED,His starved life had not fitted him for joy.
2658,POPPY SEED,It strained him to the utmost to reject
2659,POPPY SEED,Even this hour with her.  His heart beat loud.
2660,POPPY SEED,"""Damn Grootver, who can force my time to this employ!"""
2661,POPPY SEED,
2662,POPPY SEED,
2663,POPPY SEED,48
2664,POPPY SEED,
2665,POPPY SEED,He laughed again.  What boyish uncontrol
2666,POPPY SEED,To be so racked.  Then felt his ticking watch.
2667,POPPY SEED,In half an hour Grootver would know the whole.
2668,POPPY SEED,"And he would be returned, lifting the latch"
2669,POPPY SEED,"Of his own gate, eager to take Christine"
2670,POPPY SEED,And crush her to his lips.  How bear delay?
2671,POPPY SEED,"He broke into a run.  In front, a line"
2672,POPPY SEED,Of candle-light banded the cobbled street.
2673,POPPY SEED,Hilverdink's tavern!  Not for many a day
2674,POPPY SEED,"Had he been there to take his old, accustomed seat."
2675,POPPY SEED,
2676,POPPY SEED,
2677,POPPY SEED,49
2678,POPPY SEED,
2679,POPPY SEED,"""Why, Max!  Stop, Max!""  And out they came pell-mell,"
2680,POPPY SEED,"His old companions.  ""Max, where have you been?"
2681,POPPY SEED,Not drink with us?  Indeed you serve us well!
2682,POPPY SEED,How many months is it since we have seen
2683,POPPY SEED,"You here?  Jan, Jan, you slow, old doddering goat!"
2684,POPPY SEED,"Here's Mynheer Breuck come back again at last,"
2685,POPPY SEED,"Stir your old bones to welcome him.  Fie, Max."
2686,POPPY SEED,Business!  And after hours!  Fill your throat;
2687,POPPY SEED,"Here's beer or brandy.  Now, boys, hold him fast."
2688,POPPY SEED,"Put down your cane, dear man.  What really vicious whacks!"""
2689,POPPY SEED,
2690,POPPY SEED,
2691,POPPY SEED,50
2692,POPPY SEED,
2693,POPPY SEED,"They forced him to a seat, and held him there,"
2694,POPPY SEED,"Despite his anger, while the hideous joke"
2695,POPPY SEED,Was tossed from hand to hand.  Franz poured with care
2696,POPPY SEED,"A brimming glass of whiskey.  ""Here, we've broke"
2697,POPPY SEED,"Into a virgin barrel for you, drink!"
2698,POPPY SEED,"Tut!  Tut!  Just hear him!  Married!  Who, and when?"
2699,POPPY SEED,"Married, and out on business.  Clever Spark!"
2700,POPPY SEED,"Which lie's the likeliest?  Come, Max, do think."""
2701,POPPY SEED,"Swollen with fury, struggling with these men,"
2702,POPPY SEED,Max cursed hilarity which must needs have a mark.
2703,POPPY SEED,
2704,POPPY SEED,
2705,POPPY SEED,51
2706,POPPY SEED,
2707,POPPY SEED,"Forcing himself to steadiness, he tried"
2708,POPPY SEED,"To quell the uproar, told them what he dared"
2709,POPPY SEED,Of his own life and circumstance.  Implied
2710,POPPY SEED,"Most urgent matters, time could ill be spared."
2711,POPPY SEED,"In jesting mood his comrades heard his tale,"
2712,POPPY SEED,And scoffed at it.  He felt his anger more
2713,POPPY SEED,"Goaded and bursting;--""Cowards!  Is no one loth"
2714,POPPY SEED,"To mock at duty--""  Here they called for ale,"
2715,POPPY SEED,And forced a pipe upon him.  With an oath
2716,POPPY SEED,He shivered it to fragments on the earthen floor.
2717,POPPY SEED,
2718,POPPY SEED,
2719,POPPY SEED,52
2720,POPPY SEED,
2721,POPPY SEED,"Sobered a little by his violence,"
2722,POPPY SEED,"And by the host who begged them to be still,"
2723,POPPY SEED,"Nor injure his good name, ""Max, no offence,"""
2724,POPPY SEED,"They blurted, ""you may leave now if you will."""
2725,POPPY SEED,"""One moment, Max,"" said Franz.  ""We've gone too far."
2726,POPPY SEED,I ask your pardon for our foolish joke.
2727,POPPY SEED,It started in a wager ere you came.
2728,POPPY SEED,"The talk somehow had fall'n on drugs, a jar"
2729,POPPY SEED,"I brought from China, herbs the natives smoke,"
2730,POPPY SEED,"Was with me, and I thought merely to play a game."
2731,POPPY SEED,
2732,POPPY SEED,
2733,POPPY SEED,53
2734,POPPY SEED,
2735,POPPY SEED,Its properties are to induce a sleep
2736,POPPY SEED,"Fraught with adventure, and the flight of time"
2737,POPPY SEED,Is inconceivable in swiftness.  Deep
2738,POPPY SEED,"Sunken in slumber, imageries sublime"
2739,POPPY SEED,"Flatter the senses, or some fearful dream"
2740,POPPY SEED,Holds them enmeshed.  Years pass which on the clock
2741,POPPY SEED,Are but so many seconds.  We agreed
2742,POPPY SEED,That the next man who came should prove the scheme;
2743,POPPY SEED,And you were he.  Jan handed you the crock.
2744,POPPY SEED,"Two whiffs!  And then the pipe was broke, and you were freed."""
2745,POPPY SEED,
2746,POPPY SEED,
2747,POPPY SEED,54
2748,POPPY SEED,
2749,POPPY SEED,"""It is a lie, a damned, infernal lie!"""
2750,POPPY SEED,"Max Breuck was maddened now.  ""Another jest"
2751,POPPY SEED,Of your befuddled wits.  I know not why
2752,POPPY SEED,I am to be your butt.  At my request
2753,POPPY SEED,You'll choose among you one who'll answer for
2754,POPPY SEED,Your most unseasonable mirth.  Good-night
2755,POPPY SEED,"And good-by,--gentlemen.  You'll hear from me."""
2756,POPPY SEED,"But Franz had caught him at the very door,"
2757,POPPY SEED,"""It is no lie, Max Breuck, and for your plight"
2758,POPPY SEED,"I am to blame.  Come back, and we'll talk quietly."
2759,POPPY SEED,
2760,POPPY SEED,
2761,POPPY SEED,55
2762,POPPY SEED,
2763,POPPY SEED,"You have no business, that is why we laughed,"
2764,POPPY SEED,Since you had none a few minutes ago.
2765,POPPY SEED,"As to your wedding, naturally we chaffed,"
2766,POPPY SEED,Knowing the length of time it takes to do
2767,POPPY SEED,A simple thing like that in this slow world.
2768,POPPY SEED,"Indeed, Max, 'twas a dream.  Forgive me then."
2769,POPPY SEED,"I'll burn the drug if you prefer.""  But Breuck"
2770,POPPY SEED,"Muttered and stared,--""A lie.""  And then he hurled,"
2771,POPPY SEED,"Distraught, this word at Franz:  ""Prove it.  And when"
2772,POPPY SEED,"It's proven, I'll believe.  That thing shall be your work."
2773,POPPY SEED,
2774,POPPY SEED,
2775,POPPY SEED,56
2776,POPPY SEED,
2777,POPPY SEED,I'll give you just one week to make your case.
2778,POPPY SEED,"On August thirty-first, eighteen-fourteen,"
2779,POPPY SEED,"I shall require your proof.""  With wondering face"
2780,POPPY SEED,"Franz cried, ""A week to August, and fourteen"
2781,POPPY SEED,"The year!  You're mad, 'tis April now."
2782,POPPY SEED,"April, and eighteen-twelve.""  Max staggered, caught"
2783,POPPY SEED,"A chair,--""April two years ago!  Indeed,"
2784,POPPY SEED,"Or you, or I, are mad.  I know not how"
2785,POPPY SEED,"Either could blunder so.""  Hilverdink brought"
2786,POPPY SEED,"""The Amsterdam Gazette"", and Max was forced to read."
2787,POPPY SEED,
2788,POPPY SEED,
2789,POPPY SEED,57
2790,POPPY SEED,
2791,POPPY SEED,"""Eighteen hundred and twelve,"" in largest print;"
2792,POPPY SEED,"And next to it, ""April the twenty-first."""
2793,POPPY SEED,"The letters smeared and jumbled, but by dint"
2794,POPPY SEED,"Of straining every nerve to meet the worst,"
2795,POPPY SEED,"He read it, and into his pounding brain"
2796,POPPY SEED,Tumbled a horror.  Like a roaring sea
2797,POPPY SEED,"Foreboding shipwreck, came the message plain:"
2798,POPPY SEED,"""This is two years ago!  What of Christine?"""
2799,POPPY SEED,"He fled the cellar, in his agony"
2800,POPPY SEED,"Running to outstrip Fate, and save his holy shrine."
2801,POPPY SEED,
2802,POPPY SEED,
2803,POPPY SEED,58
2804,POPPY SEED,
2805,POPPY SEED,The darkened buildings echoed to his feet
2806,POPPY SEED,Clap-clapping on the pavement as he ran.
2807,POPPY SEED,Across moon-misted squares clamoured his fleet
2808,POPPY SEED,And terror-winged steps.  His heart began
2809,POPPY SEED,"To labour at the speed.  And still no sign,"
2810,POPPY SEED,No flutter of a leaf against the sky.
2811,POPPY SEED,"And this should be the garden wall, and round"
2812,POPPY SEED,"The corner, the old gate.  No even line"
2813,POPPY SEED,Was this!  No wall!  And then a fearful cry
2814,POPPY SEED,Shattered the stillness.  Two stiff houses filled the ground.
2815,POPPY SEED,
2816,POPPY SEED,
2817,POPPY SEED,59
2818,POPPY SEED,
2819,POPPY SEED,"Shoulder to shoulder, like dragoons in line,"
2820,POPPY SEED,"They stood, and Max knew them to be the ones"
2821,POPPY SEED,To right and left of Kurler's garden.  Spine
2822,POPPY SEED,Rigid next frozen spine.  No mellow tones
2823,POPPY SEED,"Of ancient gilded iron, undulate,"
2824,POPPY SEED,"Expanding in wide circles and broad curves,"
2825,POPPY SEED,"The twisted iron of the garden gate,"
2826,POPPY SEED,Was there.  The houses touched and left no space
2827,POPPY SEED,Between.  With glassy eyes and shaking nerves
2828,POPPY SEED,"Max gazed.  Then mad with fear, fled still, and left that place."
2829,POPPY SEED,
2830,POPPY SEED,
2831,POPPY SEED,60
2832,POPPY SEED,
2833,POPPY SEED,"Stumbling and panting, on he ran, and on."
2834,POPPY SEED,"His slobbering lips could only cry, ""Christine!"
2835,POPPY SEED,My Dearest Love!  My Wife!  Where are you gone?
2836,POPPY SEED,"What future is our past?  What saturnine,"
2837,POPPY SEED,Sardonic devil's jest has bid us live
2838,POPPY SEED,Two years together in a puff of smoke?
2839,POPPY SEED,"It was no dream, I swear it!  In some star,"
2840,POPPY SEED,"Or still imprisoned in Time's egg, you give"
2841,POPPY SEED,"Me love.  I feel it.  Dearest Dear, this stroke"
2842,POPPY SEED,"Shall never part us, I will reach to where you are."""
2843,POPPY SEED,
2844,POPPY SEED,
2845,POPPY SEED,61
2846,POPPY SEED,
2847,POPPY SEED,His burning eyeballs stared into the dark.
2848,POPPY SEED,The moon had long been set.  And still he cried:
2849,POPPY SEED,"""Christine!  My Love!  Christine!""  A sudden spark"
2850,POPPY SEED,"Pricked through the gloom, and shortly Max espied"
2851,POPPY SEED,"With his uncertain vision, so within"
2852,POPPY SEED,"Distracted he could scarcely trust its truth,"
2853,POPPY SEED,A latticed window where a crimson gleam
2854,POPPY SEED,"Spangled the blackness, and hung from a pin,"
2855,POPPY SEED,"An iron crane, were three gilt balls.  His youth"
2856,POPPY SEED,"Had taught their meaning, now they closed upon his dream."
2857,POPPY SEED,
2858,POPPY SEED,
2859,POPPY SEED,62
2860,POPPY SEED,
2861,POPPY SEED,"Softly he knocked against the casement, wide"
2862,POPPY SEED,"It flew, and a cracked voice his business there"
2863,POPPY SEED,"Demanded.  The door opened, and inside"
2864,POPPY SEED,Max stepped.  He saw a candle held in air
2865,POPPY SEED,Above the head of a gray-bearded Jew.
2866,POPPY SEED,"""Simeon Isaacs, Mynheer, can I serve"
2867,POPPY SEED,"You?""  ""Yes, I think you can.  Do you keep arms?"
2868,POPPY SEED,"I want a pistol.""  Quick the old man grew"
2869,POPPY SEED,"Livid.  ""Mynheer, a pistol!  Let me swerve"
2870,POPPY SEED,"You from your purpose.  Life brings often false alarms--"""
2871,POPPY SEED,
2872,POPPY SEED,
2873,POPPY SEED,63
2874,POPPY SEED,
2875,POPPY SEED,"""Peace, good old Isaacs, why should you suppose"
2876,POPPY SEED,My purpose deadly.  In good truth I've been
2877,POPPY SEED,Blest above others.  You have many rows
2878,POPPY SEED,"Of pistols it would seem.  Here, this shagreen"
2879,POPPY SEED,Case holds one that I fancy.  Silvered mounts
2880,POPPY SEED,Are to my taste.  These letters `C. D. L.'
2881,POPPY SEED,"Its former owner?  Dead, you say.  Poor Ghost!"
2882,POPPY SEED,"'Twill serve my turn though--""  Hastily he counts"
2883,POPPY SEED,"The florins down upon the table.  ""Well,"
2884,POPPY SEED,"Good-night, and wish me luck for your to-morrow's toast."""
2885,POPPY SEED,
2886,POPPY SEED,
2887,POPPY SEED,64
2888,POPPY SEED,
2889,POPPY SEED,"Into the night again he hurried, now"
2890,POPPY SEED,Pale and in haste; and far beyond the town
2891,POPPY SEED,He set his goal.  And then he wondered how
2892,POPPY SEED,"Poor C. D. L. had come to die.  ""It's grown"
2893,POPPY SEED,"Handy in killing, maybe, this I've bought,"
2894,POPPY SEED,"And will work punctually.""  His sorrow fell"
2895,POPPY SEED,"Upon his senses, shutting out all else."
2896,POPPY SEED,"Again he wept, and called, and blindly fought"
2897,POPPY SEED,"The heavy miles away.  ""Christine.  I'm well."
2898,POPPY SEED,"I'm coming.  My Own Wife!""  He lurched with failing pulse."
2899,POPPY SEED,
2900,POPPY SEED,
2901,POPPY SEED,65
2902,POPPY SEED,
2903,POPPY SEED,"Along the dyke the keen air blew in gusts,"
2904,POPPY SEED,And grasses bent and wailed before the wind.
2905,POPPY SEED,"The Zuider Zee, which croons all night and thrusts"
2906,POPPY SEED,Long stealthy fingers up some way to find
2907,POPPY SEED,"And crumble down the stones, moaned baffled.  Here"
2908,POPPY SEED,The wide-armed windmills looked like gallows-trees.
2909,POPPY SEED,No lights were burning in the distant thorps.
2910,POPPY SEED,"Max laid aside his coat.  His mind, half-clear,"
2911,POPPY SEED,"Babbled ""Christine!""  A shot split through the breeze."
2912,POPPY SEED,The cold stars winked and glittered at his chilling corpse.
2913,POPPY SEED,
2914,POPPY SEED,
2915,POPPY SEED,
2916,POPPY SEED,
2917,POPPY SEED,"Sancta Maria, Succurre Miseris"
2918,POPPY SEED,
2919,POPPY SEED,
2920,POPPY SEED,
2921,POPPY SEED,"Dear Virgin Mary, far away,"
2922,POPPY SEED,Look down from Heaven while I pray.
2923,POPPY SEED,"Open your golden casement high,"
2924,POPPY SEED,And lean way out beyond the sky.
2925,POPPY SEED,"I am so little, it may be"
2926,POPPY SEED,A task for you to harken me.
2927,POPPY SEED,
2928,POPPY SEED,"O Lady Mary, I have bought"
2929,POPPY SEED,"A candle, as the good priest taught."
2930,POPPY SEED,"I only had one penny, so"
2931,POPPY SEED,Old Goody Jenkins let it go.
2932,POPPY SEED,"It is a little bent, you see."
2933,POPPY SEED,"But Oh, be merciful to me!"
2934,POPPY SEED,
2935,POPPY SEED,"I have not anything to give,"
2936,POPPY SEED,Yet I so long for him to live.
2937,POPPY SEED,A year ago he sailed away
2938,POPPY SEED,And not a word unto today.
2939,POPPY SEED,I've strained my eyes from the sea-wall
2940,POPPY SEED,But never does he come at all.
2941,POPPY SEED,
2942,POPPY SEED,Other ships have entered port
2943,POPPY SEED,"Their voyages finished, long or short,"
2944,POPPY SEED,And other sailors have received
2945,POPPY SEED,"Their welcomes, while I sat and grieved."
2946,POPPY SEED,"My heart is bursting for his hail,"
2947,POPPY SEED,"O Virgin, let me spy his sail."
2948,POPPY SEED,
2949,POPPY SEED,_Hull down on the edge of a sun-soaked sea
2950,POPPY SEED,Sparkle the bellying sails for me.
2951,POPPY SEED,Taut to the push of a rousing wind
2952,POPPY SEED,"Shaking the sea till it foams behind,"
2953,POPPY SEED,The tightened rigging is shrill with the song:
2954,POPPY SEED,"""We are back again who were gone so long.""_"
2955,POPPY SEED,
2956,POPPY SEED,One afternoon I bumped my head.
2957,POPPY SEED,I sat on a post and wished I were dead
2958,POPPY SEED,"Like father and mother, for no one cared"
2959,POPPY SEED,Whither I went or how I fared.
2960,POPPY SEED,"A man's voice said, ""My little lad,"
2961,POPPY SEED,"Here's a bit of a toy to make you glad."""
2962,POPPY SEED,
2963,POPPY SEED,"Then I opened my eyes and saw him plain,"
2964,POPPY SEED,"With his sleeves rolled up, and the dark blue stain"
2965,POPPY SEED,"Of tattooed skin, where a flock of quail"
2966,POPPY SEED,Flew up to his shoulder and met the tail
2967,POPPY SEED,"Of a dragon curled, all pink and green,"
2968,POPPY SEED,"Which sprawled on his back, when it was seen."
2969,POPPY SEED,
2970,POPPY SEED,He held out his hand and gave to me
2971,POPPY SEED,The most marvellous top which could ever be.
2972,POPPY SEED,"It had ivory eyes, and jet-black rings,"
2973,POPPY SEED,"And a red stone carved into little wings,"
2974,POPPY SEED,"All joined by a twisted golden line,"
2975,POPPY SEED,"And set in the brown wood, even and fine."
2976,POPPY SEED,
2977,POPPY SEED,"Forgive me, Lady, I have not brought"
2978,POPPY SEED,"My treasure to you as I ought,"
2979,POPPY SEED,But he said to keep it for his sake
2980,POPPY SEED,"And comfort myself with it, and take"
2981,POPPY SEED,"Joy in its spinning, and so I do."
2982,POPPY SEED,It couldn't mean quite the same to you.
2983,POPPY SEED,
2984,POPPY SEED,"Every day I met him there,"
2985,POPPY SEED,Where the fisher-nets dry in the sunny air.
2986,POPPY SEED,"He told me stories of courts and kings,"
2987,POPPY SEED,"Of storms at sea, of lots of things."
2988,POPPY SEED,The top he said was a sort of sign
2989,POPPY SEED,That something in the big world was mine.
2990,POPPY SEED,
2991,POPPY SEED,_Blue and white on a sun-shot ocean.
2992,POPPY SEED,Against the horizon a glint in motion.
2993,POPPY SEED,"Full in the grasp of a shoving wind,"
2994,POPPY SEED,"Trailing her bubbles of foam behind,"
2995,POPPY SEED,"Singing and shouting to port she races,"
2996,POPPY SEED,"A flying harp, with her sheets and braces._"
2997,POPPY SEED,
2998,POPPY SEED,"O Queen of Heaven, give me heed,"
2999,POPPY SEED,I am in very utmost need.
3000,POPPY SEED,"He loved me, he was all I had,"
3001,POPPY SEED,And when he came it made the sad
3002,POPPY SEED,Thoughts disappear.  This very day
3003,POPPY SEED,Send his ship home to me I pray.
3004,POPPY SEED,
3005,POPPY SEED,"I'll be a priest, if you want it so,"
3006,POPPY SEED,I'll work till I have enough to go
3007,POPPY SEED,And study Latin to say the prayers
3008,POPPY SEED,On the rosary our old priest wears.
3009,POPPY SEED,"I wished to be a sailor too,"
3010,POPPY SEED,But I will give myself to you.
3011,POPPY SEED,
3012,POPPY SEED,"I'll never even spin my top,"
3013,POPPY SEED,But put it away in a box.  I'll stop
3014,POPPY SEED,Whistling the sailor-songs he taught.
3015,POPPY SEED,I'll save my pennies till I have bought
3016,POPPY SEED,"A silver heart in the market square,"
3017,POPPY SEED,"I've seen some beautiful, white ones there."
3018,POPPY SEED,
3019,POPPY SEED,I'll give up all I want to do
3020,POPPY SEED,And do whatever you tell me to.
3021,POPPY SEED,"Heavenly Lady, take away"
3022,POPPY SEED,"All the games I like to play,"
3023,POPPY SEED,"Take my life to fill the score,"
3024,POPPY SEED,Only bring him back once more!
3025,POPPY SEED,
3026,POPPY SEED,"_The poplars shiver and turn their leaves,"
3027,POPPY SEED,And the wind through the belfry moans and grieves.
3028,POPPY SEED,"The gray dust whirls in the market square,"
3029,POPPY SEED,And the silver hearts are covered with care
3030,POPPY SEED,By thick tarpaulins.  Once again
3031,POPPY SEED,The bay is black under heavy rain._
3032,POPPY SEED,
3033,POPPY SEED,The Queen of Heaven has shut her door.
3034,POPPY SEED,A little boy weeps and prays no more.

3039,POPPY SEED,After Hearing a Waltz by Bartók
3040,POPPY SEED,
3041,POPPY SEED,
3042,POPPY SEED,
3043,POPPY SEED,But why did I kill him?  Why?  Why?
3044,POPPY SEED,"In the small, gilded room, near the stair?"
3045,POPPY SEED,"My ears rack and throb with his cry,"
3046,POPPY SEED,"And his eyes goggle under his hair,"
3047,POPPY SEED,As my fingers sink into the fair
3048,POPPY SEED,White skin of his throat.  It was I!
3049,POPPY SEED,
3050,POPPY SEED,I killed him!  My God!  Don't you hear?
3051,POPPY SEED,I shook him until his red tongue
3052,POPPY SEED,"Hung flapping out through the black, queer,"
3053,POPPY SEED,Swollen lines of his lips.  And I clung
3054,POPPY SEED,"With my nails drawing blood, while I flung"
3055,POPPY SEED,"The loose, heavy body in fear."
3056,POPPY SEED,
3057,POPPY SEED,Fear lest he should still not be dead.
3058,POPPY SEED,I was drunk with the lust of his life.
3059,POPPY SEED,The blood-drops oozed slow from his head
3060,POPPY SEED,And dabbled a chair.  And our strife
3061,POPPY SEED,"Lasted one reeling second, his knife"
3062,POPPY SEED,Lay and winked in the lights overhead.
3063,POPPY SEED,
3064,POPPY SEED,"And the waltz from the ballroom I heard,"
3065,POPPY SEED,"When I called him a low, sneaking cur."
3066,POPPY SEED,And the wail of the violins stirred
3067,POPPY SEED,My brute anger with visions of her.
3068,POPPY SEED,"As I throttled his windpipe, the purr"
3069,POPPY SEED,Of his breath with the waltz became blurred.
3070,POPPY SEED,
3071,POPPY SEED,"I have ridden ten miles through the dark,"
3072,POPPY SEED,"With that music, an infernal din,"
3073,POPPY SEED,Pounding rhythmic inside me.  Just Hark!
3074,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  And my fingers sink in
3075,POPPY SEED,"To his flesh when the violins, thin"
3076,POPPY SEED,"And straining with passion, grow stark."
3077,POPPY SEED,
3078,POPPY SEED,"One!  Two!  Three!  Oh, the horror of sound!"
3079,POPPY SEED,While she danced I was crushing his throat.
3080,POPPY SEED,"He had tasted the joy of her, wound"
3081,POPPY SEED,"Round her body, and I heard him gloat"
3082,POPPY SEED,On the favour.  That instant I smote.
3083,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  How the dancers swirl round!
3084,POPPY SEED,
3085,POPPY SEED,"He is here in the room, in my arm,"
3086,POPPY SEED,His limp body hangs on the spin
3087,POPPY SEED,"Of the waltz we are dancing, a swarm"
3088,POPPY SEED,Of blood-drops is hemming us in!
3089,POPPY SEED,Round and round!  One!  Two!  Three!  And his sin
3090,POPPY SEED,Is red like his tongue lolling warm.
3091,POPPY SEED,
3092,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  And the drums are his knell.
3093,POPPY SEED,"He is heavy, his feet beat the floor"
3094,POPPY SEED,As I drag him about in the swell
3095,POPPY SEED,"Of the waltz.  With a menacing roar,"
3096,POPPY SEED,The trumpets crash in through the door.
3097,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three! clangs his funeral bell.
3098,POPPY SEED,
3099,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  In the chaos of space
3100,POPPY SEED,Rolls the earth to the hideous glee
3101,POPPY SEED,"Of death!  And so cramped is this place,"
3102,POPPY SEED,I stifle and pant.  One!  Two!  Three!
3103,POPPY SEED,Round and round!  God!  'Tis he throttles me!
3104,POPPY SEED,He has covered my mouth with his face!
3105,POPPY SEED,
3106,POPPY SEED,And his blood has dripped into my heart!
3107,POPPY SEED,And my heart beats and labours.  One!  Two!
3108,POPPY SEED,Three!  His dead limbs have coiled every part
3109,POPPY SEED,Of my body in tentacles.  Through
3110,POPPY SEED,My ears the waltz jangles.  Like glue
3111,POPPY SEED,His dead body holds me athwart.
3112,POPPY SEED,
3113,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  Give me air!  Oh!  My God!
3114,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  I am drowning in slime!
3115,POPPY SEED,"One!  Two!  Three!  And his corpse, like a clod,"
3116,POPPY SEED,"Beats me into a jelly!  The chime,"
3117,POPPY SEED,One!  Two!  Three!  And his dead legs keep time.
3118,POPPY SEED,Air!  Give me air!  Air!  My God!

3124,POPPY SEED,
3125,POPPY SEED,
3126,POPPY SEED,
3127,POPPY SEED,The fountain bent and straightened itself
3128,POPPY SEED,"In the night wind,"
3129,POPPY SEED,Blowing like a flower.
3130,POPPY SEED,"It gleamed and glittered,"
3131,POPPY SEED,"A tall white lily,"
3132,POPPY SEED,Under the eye of the golden moon.
3133,POPPY SEED,"From a stone seat,"
3134,POPPY SEED,"Beneath a blossoming lime,"
3135,POPPY SEED,The man watched it.
3136,POPPY SEED,And the spray pattered
3137,POPPY SEED,On the dim grass at his feet.
3138,POPPY SEED,
3139,POPPY SEED,"The fountain tossed its water,"
3140,POPPY SEED,"Up and up, like silver marbles."
3141,POPPY SEED,Is that an arm he sees?
3142,POPPY SEED,And for one moment
3143,POPPY SEED,Does he catch the moving curve
3144,POPPY SEED,Of a thigh?
3145,POPPY SEED,"The fountain gurgled and splashed,"
3146,POPPY SEED,And the man's face was wet.
3147,POPPY SEED,
3148,POPPY SEED,Is it singing that he hears?
3149,POPPY SEED,A song of playing at ball?
3150,POPPY SEED,"The moonlight shines on the straight column of water,"
3151,POPPY SEED,"And through it he sees a woman,"
3152,POPPY SEED,Tossing the water-balls.
3153,POPPY SEED,"Her breasts point outwards,"
3154,POPPY SEED,And the nipples are like buds of peonies.
3155,POPPY SEED,"Her flanks ripple as she plays,"
3156,POPPY SEED,And the water is not more undulating
3157,POPPY SEED,Than the lines of her body.
3158,POPPY SEED,
3159,POPPY SEED,"""Come,"" she sings, ""Poet!"
3160,POPPY SEED,"Am I not more worth than your day ladies,"
3161,POPPY SEED,"Covered with awkward stuffs,"
3162,POPPY SEED,"Unreal, unbeautiful?"
3163,POPPY SEED,What do you fear in taking me?
3164,POPPY SEED,Is not the night for poets?
3165,POPPY SEED,"I am your dream,"
3166,POPPY SEED,"Recurrent as water,"
3167,POPPY SEED,"Gemmed with the moon!"""
3168,POPPY SEED,
3169,POPPY SEED,She steps to the edge of the pool
3170,POPPY SEED,"And the water runs, rustling, down her sides."
3171,POPPY SEED,"She stretches out her arms,"
3172,POPPY SEED,And the fountain streams behind her
3173,POPPY SEED,Like an opened veil.

3213,I,He has forgotten the woman in the room with the geraniums.  He is beating
3214,I,"his brain, and in his eardrums hammers his heavy pulse.  She sits"
3215,I,"on the window-sill, with the basket in her lap.  And tap!  She cracks a nut."
3216,I,"And tap!  Another.  Tap!  Tap!  Tap!  The shells ricochet upon the roof,"
3217,I,"and get into the gutters, and bounce over the edge and disappear."
3218,I,
3219,I,"""It is very queer,"" thinks Peter, ""the basket was empty, I'm sure."
3220,I,"How could nuts appear from the atmosphere?"""
3221,I,
3222,I,"The silver-blue moonlight makes the geraniums purple, and the roof glitters"
3223,I,like ice.
3224,I,
3225,I,
3226,II,II
3227,II,
3228,II,Five o'clock.  The geraniums are very gay in their crimson array.
3229,II,"The bellying clouds swing over the housetops, and over the roofs goes Peter"
3230,II,to pay his morning's work with a holiday.
3231,II,
3232,II,"""Annette, it is I.  Have you finished?  Can I come?"""
3233,II,
3234,II,Peter jumps through the window.
3235,II,
3236,II,"""Dear, are you alone?"""
3237,II,
3238,II,"""Look, Peter, the dome of the tabernacle is done.  This gold thread"
3239,II,"is so very high, I am glad it is morning, a starry sky would have"
3240,II,"seen me bankrupt.  Sit down, now tell me, is your story going well?"""
3241,II,
3242,II,"The golden dome glittered in the orange of the setting sun.  On the walls,"
3243,II,"at intervals, hung altar-cloths and chasubles, and copes, and stoles,"
3244,II,"and coffin palls.  All stiff with rich embroidery, and stitched with"
3245,II,"so much artistry, they seemed like spun and woven gems, or flower-buds"
3246,II,new-opened on their stems.
3247,II,
3248,II,
3249,II,"Annette looked at the geraniums, very red against the blue sky."
3250,II,
3251,II,"""No matter how I try, I cannot find any thread of such a red."
3252,II,My bleeding hearts drip stuff muddy in comparison.  Heigh-ho!  See my little
3253,II,pecking dove?  I'm in love with my own temple.  Only that halo's wrong.
3254,II,"The colour's too strong, or not strong enough.  I don't know.  My eyes"
3255,II,"are tired.  Oh, Peter, don't be so rough; it is valuable.  I won't do"
3256,II,"any more.  I promise.  You tyrannise, Dear, that's enough.  Now sit down"
3257,II,"and amuse me while I rest."""
3258,II,
3259,II,"The shadows of the geraniums creep over the floor, and begin to climb"
3260,II,the opposite wall.
3261,II,
3262,II,
3263,II,"Peter watches her, fluid with fatigue, floating, and drifting,"
3264,II,"and undulant in the orange glow.  His senses flow towards her,"
3265,II,where she lies supine and dreaming.  Seeming drowned in a golden halo.
3266,II,
3267,II,The pungent smell of the geraniums is hard to bear.
3268,II,
3269,II,
3270,II,"He pushes against her knees, and brushes his lips across her languid hands."
3271,II,"His lips are hot and speechless.  He woos her, quivering, and the room"
3272,II,"is filled with shadows, for the sun has set.  But she only understands"
3273,II,"the ways of a needle through delicate stuffs, and the shock of one colour"
3274,II,"on another.  She does not see that this is the same, and querulously murmurs"
3275,II,his name.
3276,II,
3277,II,"""Peter, I don't want it.  I am tired."""
3278,II,
3279,II,"And he, the undesired, burns and is consumed."
3280,II,
3281,II,There is a crescent moon on the rim of the sky.
3282,II,
3283,II,
3284,III,III
3285,III,
3286,III,"""Go home, now, Peter.  To-night is full moon.  I must be alone."""
3287,III,
3288,III,"""How soon the moon is full again!  Annette, let me stay.  Indeed, Dear Love,"
3289,III,"I shall not go away.  My God, but you keep me starved!  You write"
3290,III,"`No Entrance Here', over all the doors.  Is it not strange, my Dear,"
3291,III,"that loving, yet you deny me entrance everywhere.  Would marriage"
3292,III,"strike you blind, or, hating bonds as you do, why should I be denied"
3293,III,"the rights of loving if I leave you free?  You want the whole of me,"
3294,III,"you pick my brains to rest you, but you give me not one heart-beat."
3295,III,"Oh, forgive me, Sweet!  I suffer in my loving, and you know it.  I cannot"
3296,III,"feed my life on being a poet.  Let me stay."""
3297,III,
3298,III,"""As you please, poor Peter, but it will hurt me if you do.  It will"
3299,III,"crush your heart and squeeze the love out."""
3300,III,
3301,III,"He answered gruffly, ""I know what I'm about."""
3302,III,
3303,III,"""Only remember one thing from to-night.  My work is taxing and I must"
3304,III,"have sight!  I _must_!"""
3305,III,
3306,III,"The clear moon looks in between the geraniums.  On the wall,"
3307,III,the shadow of the man is divided from the shadow of the woman
3308,III,by a silver thread.
3309,III,
3310,III,
3311,III,"They are eyes, hundreds of eyes, round like marbles!  Unwinking, for there"
3312,III,"are no lids.  Blue, black, gray, and hazel, and the irises are cased"
3313,III,"in the whites, and they glitter and spark under the moon.  The basket"
3314,III,is heaped with human eyes.  She cracks off the whites and throws them away.
3315,III,"They ricochet upon the roof, and get into the gutters, and bounce"
3316,III,"over the edge and disappear.  But she is here, quietly sitting"
3317,III,"on the window-sill, eating human eyes."
3318,III,
3319,III,"The silver-blue moonlight makes the geraniums purple, and the roof shines"

3326,IV,"and over him sticks, and never moves, an eye.  It lights the sky with blood,"
3327,IV,"and drips blood.  And the drops sizzle on his bare skin, and he smells them"
3328,IV,"burning in, and branding his body with the name ""Annette""."
3329,IV,
3330,IV,The blood-red sky is outside his window now.  Is it blood or fire?
3331,IV,"Merciful God!  Fire!  And his heart wrenches and pounds ""Annette!"""

3360,I,Over the yawning chimney hangs the fog.  Drip--hiss--drip--hiss--
3361,I,"fall the raindrops on the oaken log which burns, and steams,"
3362,I,and smokes the ceiling beams.  Drip--hiss--the rain never stops.
3363,I,
3364,I,
3365,I,"The wide, state bed shivers beneath its velvet coverlet.  Above, dim,"
3366,I,"in the smoke, a tarnished coronet gleams dully.  Overhead hammers and chinks"
3367,I,"the rain.  Fearfully wails the wind down distant corridors, and there comes"
3368,I,the swish and sigh of rushes lifted off the floors.  The arras blows sidewise
3369,I,"out from the wall, and then falls back again."
3370,I,
3371,I,
3372,I,"It is my lady's key, confided with much nice cunning, whisperingly."
3373,I,"He enters on a sob of wind, which gutters the candles almost to swaling."
3374,I,The fire flutters and drops.  Drip--hiss--the rain never stops.
3375,I,He shuts the door.  The rushes fall again to stillness along the floor.
3376,I,"Outside, the wind goes wailing."
3377,I,
3378,I,
3379,I,"The velvet coverlet of the wide bed is smooth and cold.  Above,"
3380,I,"in the firelight, winks the coronet of tarnished gold.  The knight shivers"
3381,I,"in his coat of fur, and holds out his hands to the withering flame."
3382,I,"She is always the same, a sweet coquette.  He will wait for her."
3383,I,
3384,I,How the log hisses and drips!  How warm and satisfying will be her lips!
3385,I,
3386,I,
3387,I,"It is wide and cold, the state bed; but when her head lies under the coronet,"
3388,I,"and her eyes are full and wet with love, and when she holds out her arms,"
3389,I,"and the velvet counterpane half slips from her, and alarms"
3390,I,"her trembling modesty, how eagerly he will leap to cover her, and blot himself"
3391,I,"beneath the quilt, making her laugh and tremble."
3392,I,
3393,I,"Is it guilt to free a lady from her palsied lord, absent and fighting,"
3394,I,terribly abhorred?
3395,I,
3396,I,
3397,I,He stirs a booted heel and kicks a rolling coal.  His spur clinks
3398,I,"on the hearth.  Overhead, the rain hammers and chinks.  She is so pure"
3399,I,"and whole.  Only because he has her soul will she resign herself to him,"
3400,I,"for where the soul has gone, the body must be given as a sign.  He takes her"
3401,I,"by the divine right of the only lover.  He has sworn to fight her lord,"
3402,I,"and wed her after.  Should he be overborne, she will die adoring him, forlorn,"
3403,I,shriven by her great love.
3404,I,
3405,I,"Above, the coronet winks in the darkness.  Drip--hiss--fall the raindrops."
3406,I,"The arras blows out from the wall, and a door bangs in a far-off hall."
3407,I,
3408,I,
3409,I,The candles swale.  In the gale the moat below plunges and spatters.
3410,I,Will the lady lose courage and not come?
3411,I,
3412,I,The rain claps on a loosened rafter.
3413,I,
3414,I,Is that laughter?
3415,I,
3416,I,
3417,I,The room is filled with lisps and whispers.  Something mutters.
3418,I,One candle drowns and the other gutters.  Is that the rain
3419,I,"which pads and patters, is it the wind through the winding entries"
3420,I,which chatters?
3421,I,
3422,I,The state bed is very cold and he is alone.  How far from the wall
3423,I,the arras is blown!
3424,I,
3425,I,
3426,I,Christ's Death!  It is no storm which makes these little chuckling sounds.
3427,I,"By the Great Wounds of Holy Jesus, it is his dear lady, kissing and"
3428,I,clasping someone!  Through the sobbing storm he hears her love take form
3429,I,"and flutter out in words.  They prick into his ears and stun his desire,"
3430,I,"which lies within him, hard and dead, like frozen fire.  And the little noise"
3431,I,never stops.
3432,I,
3433,I,Drip--hiss--the rain drops.
3434,I,
3435,I,
3436,I,He tears down the arras from before an inner chamber's bolted door.
3437,I,
3438,I,
3439,II,II
3440,II,
3441,II,The state bed shivers in the watery dawn.  Drip--hiss--fall the raindrops.
3442,II,For the storm never stops.
3443,II,
3444,II,"On the velvet coverlet lie two bodies, stripped and fair in the cold,"
3445,II,"grey air.  Drip--hiss--fall the blood-drops, for the bleeding never stops."
3446,II,"The bodies lie quietly.  At each side of the bed, on the floor, is a head."
3447,II,"A man's on this side, a woman's on that, and the red blood oozes along"
3448,II,the rush mat.
3449,II,
3450,II,A wisp of paper is twisted carefully into the strands of the dead man's hair.
3451,II,"It says, ""My Lord:  Your wife's paramour has paid with his life"
3452,II,"for the high favour."""
3453,II,
3454,II,"Through the lady's silver fillet is wound another paper.  It reads,"
3455,II,"""Most noble Lord:  Your wife's misdeeds are as a double-stranded"
3456,II,"necklace of beads.  But I have engaged that, on your return,"
3457,II,"she shall welcome you here.  She will not spurn your love as before,"
3458,II,"you have still the best part of her.  Her blood was red, her body white,"
3459,II,"they will both be here for your delight.  The soul inside was a lump of dirt,"
3460,II,I have rid you of that with a spurt of my sword point.  Good luck
3461,II,"to your pleasure.  She will be quite complaisant, my friend, I wager."""
3462,II,The end was a splashed flourish of ink.
3463,II,
3464,II,"Hark!  In the passage is heard the clink of armour, the tread of a heavy man."
3465,II,"The door bursts open and standing there, his thin hair wavering"
3466,II,"in the glare of steely daylight, is my Lord of Clair."
3467,II,
3468,II,
3469,II,Over the yawning chimney hangs the fog.  Drip--hiss--drip--hiss--
3470,II,fall the raindrops.  Overhead hammers and chinks the rain which never stops.
3471,II,
3472,II,"The velvet coverlet is sodden and wet, yet the roof beams are tight."
3473,II,"Overhead, the coronet gleams with its blackened gold, winking and blinking."
3474,II,Among the rushes three corpses are growing cold.

3482,III,"In sculptured filigrees.  And where the transepts of the church expand,"
3483,III,"A crusader, come from the Holy Land,"
3484,III,Lies with crossed legs and embroidered band.
3485,III,The page's name became a brand

3497,III,"High overhead the great sun hung,"
3498,III,A navel for the curving sky.
3499,III,The air was a blue clarity.
3500,III,"Swallows flew,"
3501,III,And a cock crew.
3502,III,
3503,III,"The iron clanging sank through the light air,"
3504,III,Rustled over with blowing branches.  A flare
3505,III,"Of spotted green, and a snake had gone"
3506,III,Into the bed where the snowdrops shone
3507,III,"In green new-started,"
3508,III,Their white bells parted.
3509,III,
3510,III,"Two by two, in a long brown line,"
3511,III,The nuns were walking to breathe the fine
3512,III,Bright April air.  They must go in soon
3513,III,And work at their tasks all the afternoon.
3514,III,But this time is theirs!
3515,III,They walk in pairs.
3516,III,
3517,III,"First comes the Abbess, preoccupied"
3518,III,"And slow, as a woman often tried,"
3519,III,With her temper in bond.  Then the oldest nun.
3520,III,"Then younger and younger, until the last one"
3521,III,"Has a laugh on her lips,"
3522,III,And fairly skips.
3523,III,
3524,III,They wind about the gravel walks
3525,III,And all the long line buzzes and talks.
3526,III,"They step in time to the ringing bell,"
3527,III,With scarcely a shadow.  The sun is well
3528,III,In the core of a sky
3529,III,Domed silverly.
3530,III,
3531,III,"Sister Marguerite said:  ""The pears will soon bud."""
3532,III,Sister Angelique said she must get her spud
3533,III,And free the earth round the jasmine roots.
3534,III,"Sister Veronique said:  ""Oh, look at those shoots!"
3535,III,"There's a crocus up,"
3536,III,"With a purple cup."""
3537,III,
3538,III,"But Sister Clotilde said nothing at all,"
3539,III,She looked up and down the old grey wall
3540,III,To see if a lizard were basking there.
3541,III,She looked across the garden to where
3542,III,A sycamore
3543,III,Flanked the garden door.
3544,III,
3545,III,"She was restless, although her little feet danced,"
3546,III,"And quite unsatisfied, for it chanced"
3547,III,Her morning's work had hung in her mind
3548,III,And would not take form.  She could not find
3549,III,The beautifulness
3550,III,For the Virgin's dress.
3551,III,
3552,III,"Should it be of pink, or damasked blue?"
3553,III,Or perhaps lilac with gold shotted through?
3554,III,Should it be banded with yellow and white
3555,III,"Roses, or sparked like a frosty night?"
3556,III,Or a crimson sheen
3557,III,Over some sort of green?
3558,III,
3559,III,But Clotilde's eyes saw nothing new
3560,III,"In all the garden, no single hue"
3561,III,So lovely or so marvellous
3562,III,That its use would not seem impious.
3563,III,"So on she walked,"
3564,III,And the others talked.
3565,III,
3566,III,Sister Elisabeth edged away
3567,III,"From what her companion had to say,"
3568,III,"For Sister Marthe saw the world in little,"
3569,III,She weighed every grain and recorded each tittle.
3570,III,She did plain stitching
3571,III,And worked in the kitchen.
3572,III,
3573,III,"""Sister Radegonde knows the apples won't last,"
3574,III,I told her so this Friday past.
3575,III,"I must speak to her before Compline."""
3576,III,Her words were like dust motes in slanting sunshine.
3577,III,"The other nun sighed,"
3578,III,With her pleasure quite dried.
3579,III,
3580,III,Suddenly Sister Berthe cried out:
3581,III,"""The snowdrops are blooming!""  They turned about."
3582,III,"The little white cups bent over the ground,"
3583,III,And in among the light stems wound
3584,III,"A crested snake,"
3585,III,With his eyes awake.
3586,III,
3587,III,His body was green with a metal brightness
3588,III,"Like an emerald set in a kind of whiteness,"
3589,III,"And all down his curling length were disks,"
3590,III,"Evil vermilion asterisks,"
3591,III,They paled and flooded
3592,III,As wounds fresh-blooded.
3593,III,
3594,III,"His crest was amber glittered with blue,"
3595,III,And opaque so the sun came shining through.
3596,III,It seemed a crown with fiery points.
3597,III,"When he quivered all down his scaly joints,"
3598,III,From every slot
3599,III,The sparkles shot.
3600,III,
3601,III,"The nuns huddled tightly together, fear"
3602,III,Catching their senses.  But Clotilde must peer
3603,III,"More closely at the beautiful snake,"
3604,III,She seemed entranced and eased.  Could she make
3605,III,"Colours so rare,"
3606,III,The dress were there.
3607,III,
3608,III,The Abbess shook off her lethargy.
3609,III,"""Sisters, we will walk on,"" said she."
3610,III,"Sidling away from the snowdrop bed,"
3611,III,"The line curved forwards, the Abbess ahead."
3612,III,Only Clotilde
3613,III,Was the last to yield.
3614,III,
3615,III,When the recreation hour was done
3616,III,Each went in to her task.  Alone
3617,III,"In the library, with its great north light,"
3618,III,Clotilde wrought at an exquisite
3619,III,Wreath of flowers
3620,III,For her Book of Hours.
3621,III,
3622,III,She twined the little crocus blooms
3623,III,"With snowdrops and daffodils, the glooms"
3624,III,Of laurel leaves were interwoven
3625,III,"With Stars-of-Bethlehem, and cloven"
3626,III,"Fritillaries,"
3627,III,Whose colour varies.
3628,III,
3629,III,"They framed the picture she had made,"
3630,III,Half-delighted and half-afraid.
3631,III,In a courtyard with a lozenged floor
3632,III,"The Virgin watched, and through the arched door"
3633,III,The angel came
3634,III,Like a springing flame.
3635,III,
3636,III,"His wings were dipped in violet fire,"
3637,III,His limbs were strung to holy desire.
3638,III,"He lowered his head and passed under the arch,"
3639,III,And the air seemed beating a solemn march.
3640,III,The Virgin waited
3641,III,With eyes dilated.
3642,III,
3643,III,"Her face was quiet and innocent,"
3644,III,And beautiful with her strange assent.
3645,III,A silver thread about her head
3646,III,Her halo was poised.  But in the stead
3647,III,"Of her gown, there remained"
3648,III,"The vellum, unstained."
3649,III,
3650,III,"Clotilde painted the flowers patiently,"
3651,III,Lingering over each tint and dye.
3652,III,"She could spend great pains, now she had seen"
3653,III,"That curious, unimagined green."
3654,III,A colour so strange
3655,III,It had seemed to change.
3656,III,
3657,III,She thought it had altered while she gazed.
3658,III,At first it had been simple green; then glazed
3659,III,"All over with twisting flames, each spot"
3660,III,"A molten colour, trembling and hot,"
3661,III,And every eye
3662,III,Seemed to liquefy.
3663,III,
3664,III,"She had made a plan, and her spirits danced."
3665,III,"After all, she had only glanced"
3666,III,"At that wonderful snake, and she must know"
3667,III,Just what hues made the creature throw
3668,III,Those splashes and sprays
3669,III,Of prismed rays.
3670,III,
3671,III,"When evening prayers were sung and said,"
3672,III,The nuns lit their tapers and went to bed.
3673,III,"And soon in the convent there was no light,"
3674,III,"For the moon did not rise until late that night,"
3675,III,Only the shine
3676,III,Of the lamp at the shrine.
3677,III,
3678,III,Clotilde lay still in her trembling sheets.
3679,III,Her heart shook her body with its beats.
3680,III,"She could not see till the moon should rise,"
3681,III,So she whispered prayers and kept her eyes
3682,III,On the window-square
3683,III,Till light should be there.
3684,III,
3685,III,The faintest shadow of a branch
3686,III,"Fell on the floor.  Clotilde, grown staunch"
3687,III,"With solemn purpose, softly rose"
3688,III,And fluttered down between the rows
3689,III,Of sleeping nuns.
3690,III,She almost runs.
3691,III,
3692,III,She must go out through the little side door
3693,III,Lest the nuns who were always praying before
3694,III,The Virgin's altar should hear her pass.
3695,III,"She pushed the bolts, and over the grass"
3696,III,The red moon's brim
3697,III,Mounted its rim.
3698,III,
3699,III,Her shadow crept up the convent wall
3700,III,"As she swiftly left it, over all"
3701,III,The garden lay the level glow
3702,III,"Of a moon coming up, very big and slow."
3703,III,The gravel glistened.
3704,III,She stopped and listened.
3705,III,
3706,III,"It was still, and the moonlight was getting clearer."
3707,III,"She laughed a little, but she felt queerer"
3708,III,Than ever before.  The snowdrop bed
3709,III,Was reached and she bent down her head.
3710,III,On the striped ground
3711,III,The snake was wound.
3712,III,
3713,III,"For a moment Clotilde paused in alarm,"
3714,III,Then she rolled up her sleeve and stretched out her arm.
3715,III,"She thought she heard steps, she must be quick."
3716,III,"She darted her hand out, and seized the thick"
3717,III,"Wriggling slime,"
3718,III,Only just in time.
3719,III,
3720,III,"The old gardener came muttering down the path,"
3721,III,"And his shadow fell like a broad, black swath,"
3722,III,And covered Clotilde and the angry snake.
3723,III,"He bit her, but what difference did that make!"
3724,III,The Virgin should dress
3725,III,In his loveliness.
3726,III,
3727,III,The gardener was covering his new-set plants
3728,III,"For the night was chilly, and nothing daunts"
3729,III,Your lover of growing things.  He spied
3730,III,"Something to do and turned aside,"
3731,III,And the moonlight streamed
3732,III,"On Clotilde, and gleamed."
3733,III,
3734,III,His business finished the gardener rose.
3735,III,"He shook and swore, for the moonlight shows"
3736,III,"A girl with a fire-tongued serpent, she"
3737,III,"Grasping him, laughing, while quietly"
3738,III,Her eyes are weeping.
3739,III,Is he sleeping?
3740,III,
3741,III,"He thinks it is some holy vision,"
3742,III,Brushes that aside and with decision
3743,III,"Jumps--and hits the snake with his stick,"
3744,III,"Crushes his spine, and then with quick,"
3745,III,Urgent command
3746,III,Takes her hand.
3747,III,
3748,III,"The gardener sucks the poison and spits,"
3749,III,Cursing and praying as befits
3750,III,A poor old man half out of his wits.
3751,III,"""Whatever possessed you, Sister, it's"
3752,III,Hatched of a devil
3753,III,And very evil.
3754,III,
3755,III,It's one of them horrid basilisks
3756,III,You read about.  They say a man risks
3757,III,"His life to touch it, but I guess I've sucked it"
3758,III,Out by now.  Lucky I chucked it
3759,III,Away from you.
3760,III,"I guess you'll do."""
3761,III,
3762,III,"""Oh, no, Francois, this beautiful beast"
3763,III,"Was sent to me, to me the least"
3764,III,"Worthy in all our convent, so I"
3765,III,Could finish my picture of the Most High
3766,III,"And Holy Queen,"
3767,III,In her dress of green.
3768,III,
3769,III,"He is dead now, but his colours won't fade"
3770,III,"At once, and by noon I shall have made"
3771,III,"The Virgin's robe.  Oh, Francois, see"
3772,III,How kindly the moon shines down on me!
3773,III,"I can't die yet,"
3774,III,"For the task was set."""
3775,III,
3776,III,"""You won't die now, for I've sucked it away,"""
3777,III,"Grumbled old Francois, ""so have your play."
3778,III,"If the Virgin is set on snake's colours so strong,--"""
3779,III,"""Francois, don't say things like that, it is wrong."""
3780,III,So Clotilde vented
3781,III,Her creed.  He repented.
3782,III,
3783,III,"""He can't do no more harm, Sister,"" said he."
3784,III,"""Paint as much as you like.""  And gingerly"
3785,III,He picked up the snake with his stick.  Clotilde
3786,III,"Thanked him, and begged that he would shield"
3787,III,"Her secret, though itching"
3788,III,To talk in the kitchen.
3789,III,
3790,III,"The gardener promised, not very pleased,"
3791,III,"And Clotilde, with the strain of adventure eased,"
3792,III,"Walked quickly home, while the half-high moon"
3793,III,"Made her beautiful snake-skin sparkle, and soon"
3794,III,In her bed she lay
3795,III,And waited for day.
3796,III,
3797,III,At dawn's first saffron-spired warning
3798,III,"Clotilde was up.  And all that morning,"
3799,III,"Except when she went to the chapel to pray,"
3800,III,"She painted, and when the April day"
3801,III,"Was hot with sun,"
3802,III,Clotilde had done.
3803,III,
3804,III,"Done!  She drooped, though her heart beat loud"
3805,III,"At the beauty before her, and her spirit bowed"
3806,III,To the Virgin her finely-touched thought had made.
3807,III,"A lady, in excellence arrayed,"
3808,III,And wonder-souled.
3809,III,Christ's Blessed Mould!
3810,III,
3811,III,"From long fasting Clotilde felt weary and faint,"
3812,III,But her eyes were starred like those of a saint
3813,III,Enmeshed in Heaven's beatitude.
3814,III,A sudden clamour hurled its rude
3815,III,Force to break
3816,III,Her vision awake.
3817,III,
3818,III,"The door nearly leapt from its hinges, pushed"
3819,III,By the multitude of nuns.  They hushed
3820,III,"When they saw Clotilde, in perfect quiet,"
3821,III,"Smiling, a little perplexed at the riot."
3822,III,And all the hive
3823,III,"Buzzed ""She's alive!"""
3824,III,
3825,III,Old Francois had told.  He had found the strain
3826,III,"Of silence too great, and preferred the pain"
3827,III,"Of a conscience outraged.  The news had spread,"
3828,III,And all were convinced Clotilde must be dead.
3829,III,"For Francois, to spite them,"
3830,III,Had not seen fit to right them.
3831,III,
3832,III,"The Abbess, unwontedly trembling and mild,"
3833,III,"Put her arms round Clotilde and wept, ""My child,"
3834,III,"Has the Holy Mother showed you this grace,"
3835,III,To spare you while you imaged her face?
3836,III,How could we have guessed
3837,III,Our convent so blessed!
3838,III,
3839,III,A miracle!  But Oh!  My Lamb!
3840,III,"To have you die!  And I, who am"
3841,III,"A hollow, living shell, the grave"
3842,III,"Is empty of me.  Holy Mary, I crave"
3843,III,"To be taken, Dear Mother,"
3844,III,"Instead of this other."""
3845,III,
3846,III,"She dropped on her knees and silently prayed,"
3847,III,With anguished hands and tears delayed
3848,III,To a painful slowness.  The minutes drew
3849,III,To fractions.  Then the west wind blew
3850,III,"The sound of a bell,"
3851,III,On a gusty swell.
3852,III,
3853,III,"It came skipping over the slates of the roof,"
3854,III,And the bright bell-notes seemed a reproof
3855,III,"To grief, in the eye of so fair a day."
3856,III,"The Abbess, comforted, ceased to pray."
3857,III,And the sun lit the flowers
3858,III,In Clotilde's Book of Hours.
3859,III,
3860,III,It glistened the green of the Virgin's dress
3861,III,"And made the red spots, in a flushed excess,"
3862,III,Pulse and start; and the violet wings
3863,III,Of the angel were colour which shines and sings.
3864,III,The book seemed a choir
3865,III,Of rainbow fire.
3866,III,
3867,III,"The Abbess crossed herself, and each nun"
3868,III,"Did the same, then one by one,"
3869,III,"They filed to the chapel, that incensed prayers"
3870,III,Might plead for the life of this sister of theirs.
3871,III,"Clotilde, the Inspired!"
3872,III,
3873,III,She only felt tired.
3874,III,
3875,III,*    *    *    *    *
3876,III,
3877,III,The old chronicles say she did not die
3878,III,Until heavy with years.  And that is why
3879,III,There hangs in the convent church a basket
3880,III,"Of osiered silver, a holy casket,"
3881,III,And treasured therein
3882,III,A dried snake-skin.
3883,III,
3884,III,
3885,III,
3886,III,
3887,III,The Exeter Road
3888,III,
3889,III,
3890,III,
3891,III,Panels of claret and blue which shine
3892,III,Under the moon like lees of wine.
3893,III,"A coronet done in a golden scroll,"
3894,III,And wheels which blunder and creak as they roll
3895,III,Through the muddy ruts of a moorland track.
3896,III,They daren't look back!
3897,III,
3898,III,They are whipping and cursing the horses.  Lord!
3899,III,What brutes men are when they think they're scored.
3900,III,"Behind, my bay gelding gallops with me,"
3901,III,"In a steaming sweat, it is fine to see"
3902,III,"That coach, all claret, and gold, and blue,"
3903,III,Hop about and slue.
3904,III,
3905,III,"They are scared half out of their wits, poor souls."
3906,III,For my lord has a casket full of rolls
3907,III,"Of minted sovereigns, and silver bars."
3908,III,I laugh to think how he'll show his scars
3909,III,In London to-morrow.  He whines with rage
3910,III,In his varnished cage.
3911,III,
3912,III,My lady has shoved her rings over her toes.
3913,III,'Tis an ancient trick every night-rider knows.
3914,III,"But I shall relieve her of them yet,"
3915,III,When I see she limps in the minuet
3916,III,"I must beg to celebrate this night,"
3917,III,And the green moonlight.
3918,III,
3919,III,"There's nothing to hurry about, the plain"
3920,III,"Is hours long, and the mud's a strain."
3921,III,"My gelding's uncommonly strong in the loins,"
3922,III,In half an hour I'll bag the coins.
3923,III,"'Tis a clear, sweet night on the turn of Spring."
3924,III,The chase is the thing!
3925,III,
3926,III,"How the coach flashes and wobbles, the moon"
3927,III,Dripping down so quietly on it.  A tune
3928,III,"Is beating out of the curses and screams,"
3929,III,And the cracking all through the painted seams.
3930,III,"Steady, old horse, we'll keep it in sight."
3931,III,'Tis a rare fine night!
3932,III,
3933,III,"There's a clump of trees on the dip of the down,"
3934,III,And the sky shimmers where it hangs over the town.
3935,III,It seems a shame to break the air
3936,III,"In two with this pistol, but I've my share"
3937,III,Of drudgery like other men.
3938,III,His hat?  Amen!
3939,III,
3940,III,"Hold up, you beast, now what the devil!"
3941,III,"Confound this moor for a pockholed, evil,"
3942,III,Rotten marsh.  My right leg's snapped.
3943,III,"'Tis a mercy he's rolled, but I'm nicely capped."
3944,III,A broken-legged man and a broken-legged horse!
3945,III,"They'll get me, of course."
3946,III,
3947,III,The cursed coach will reach the town
3948,III,"And they'll all come out, every loafer grown"
3949,III,A lion to handcuff a man that's down.
3950,III,"What's that?  Oh, the coachman's bulleted hat!"
3951,III,I'll give it a head to fit it pat.
3952,III,Thank you!  No cravat.
3953,III,
3954,III,
3955,III,"_They handcuffed the body just for style,"
3956,III,And they hung him in chains for the volatile
3957,III,Wind to scour him flesh from bones.
3958,III,Way out on the moor you can hear the groans
3959,III,His gibbet makes when it blows a gale.
3960,III,'Tis a common tale._
3961,III,
3962,III,
3963,III,
3964,III,
3965,III,The Shadow
3966,III,
3967,III,
3968,III,
3969,III,"Paul Jannes was working very late,"
3970,III,For this watch must be done by eight
3971,III,To-morrow or the Cardinal
3972,III,Would certainly be vexed.  Of all
3973,III,His customers the old prelate
3974,III,"Was the most important, for his state"
3975,III,"Descended to his watches and rings,"
3976,III,And he gave his mistresses many things
3977,III,To make them forget his age and smile
3978,III,"When he paid visits, and they could while"
3979,III,The time away with a diamond locket
3980,III,"Exceedingly well.  So they picked his pocket,"
3981,III,And he paid in jewels for his slobbering kisses.
3982,III,This watch was made to buy him blisses
3983,III,From an Austrian countess on her way
3984,III,"Home, and she meant to start next day."
3985,III,
3986,III,
3987,III,"Paul worked by the pointed, tulip-flame"
3988,III,"Of a tallow candle, and became"
3989,III,"So absorbed, that his old clock made him wince"
3990,III,Striking the hour a moment since.
3991,III,"Its echo, only half apprehended,"
3992,III,Lingered about the room.  He ended
3993,III,"Screwing the little rubies in,"
3994,III,"Setting the wheels to lock and spin,"
3995,III,"Curling the infinitesimal springs,"
3996,III,Fixing the filigree hands.  Chippings
3997,III,Of precious stones lay strewn about.
3998,III,The table before him was a rout
3999,III,Of splashes and sparks of coloured light.
4000,III,"There was yellow gold in sheets, and quite"
4001,III,"A heap of emeralds, and steel."
4002,III,"Here was a gem, there was a wheel."
4003,III,And glasses lay like limpid lakes
4004,III,"Shining and still, and there were flakes"
4005,III,"Of silver, and shavings of pearl,"
4006,III,And little wires all awhirl
4007,III,With the light of the candle.  He took the watch
4008,III,And wound its hands about to match
4009,III,"The time, then glanced up to take the hour"
4010,III,From the hanging clock.
4011,III,"Good, Merciful Power!"
4012,III,"How came that shadow on the wall,"
4013,III,No woman was in the room!  His tall
4014,III,Chiffonier stood gaunt behind
4015,III,"His chair.  His old cloak, rabbit-lined,"
4016,III,Hung from a peg.  The door was closed.
4017,III,Just for a moment he must have dozed.
4018,III,"He looked again, and saw it plain."
4019,III,The silhouette made a blue-black stain
4020,III,"On the opposite wall, and it never wavered"
4021,III,Even when the candle quavered
4022,III,Under his panting breath.  What made
4023,III,"That beautiful, dreadful thing, that shade"
4024,III,"Of something so lovely, so exquisite,"
4025,III,Cast from a substance which the sight
4026,III,Had not been tutored to perceive?
4027,III,Paul brushed his eyes across his sleeve.
4028,III,
4029,III,"Clear-cut, the Shadow on the wall"
4030,III,"Gleamed black, and never moved at all."
4031,III,
4032,III,
4033,III,"Paul's watches were like amulets,"
4034,III,Wrought into patterns and rosettes;
4035,III,"The cases were all set with stones,"
4036,III,"And wreathing lines, and shining zones."
4037,III,"He knew the beauty in a curve,"
4038,III,And the Shadow tortured every nerve
4039,III,With its perfect rhythm of outline
4040,III,Cutting the whitewashed wall.  So fine
4041,III,Was the neck he knew he could have spanned
4042,III,It about with the fingers of one hand.
4043,III,"The chin rose to a mouth he guessed,"
4044,III,"But could not see, the lips were pressed"
4045,III,"Loosely together, the edges close,"
4046,III,And the proud and delicate line of the nose
4047,III,"Melted into a brow, and there"
4048,III,Broke into undulant waves of hair.
4049,III,The lady was edged with the stamp of race.
4050,III,A singular vision in such a place.
4051,III,
4052,III,
4053,III,He moved the candle to the tall
4054,III,Chiffonier; the Shadow stayed on the wall.
4055,III,"He threw his cloak upon a chair,"
4056,III,And still the lady's face was there.
4057,III,From every corner of the room
4058,III,"He saw, in the patch of light, the gloom"
4059,III,That was the lady.  Her violet bloom
4060,III,Was almost brighter than that which came
4061,III,From his candle's tulip-flame.
4062,III,He set the filigree hands; he laid
4063,III,The watch in the case which he had made;
4064,III,"He put on his rabbit cloak, and snuffed"
4065,III,His candle out.  The room seemed stuffed
4066,III,"With darkness.  Softly he crossed the floor,"
4067,III,And let himself out through the door.
4068,III,
4069,III,
4070,III,The sun was flashing from every pin
4071,III,"And wheel, when Paul let himself in."
4072,III,The whitewashed walls were hot with light.
4073,III,"The room was the core of a chrysolite,"
4074,III,Burning and shimmering with fiery might.
4075,III,The sun was so bright that no shadow could fall
4076,III,From the furniture upon the wall.
4077,III,Paul sighed as he looked at the empty space
4078,III,Where a glare usurped the lady's place.
4079,III,"He settled himself to his work, but his mind"
4080,III,"Wandered, and he would wake to find"
4081,III,"His hand suspended, his eyes grown dim,"
4082,III,And nothing advanced beyond the rim
4083,III,Of his dreaming.  The Cardinal sent to pay
4084,III,"For his watch, which had purchased so fine a day."
4085,III,"But Paul could hardly touch the gold,"
4086,III,"It seemed the price of his Shadow, sold."
4087,III,With the first twilight he struck a match
4088,III,And watched the little blue stars hatch
4089,III,Into an egg of perfect flame.
4090,III,"He lit his candle, and almost in shame"
4091,III,"At his eagerness, lifted his eyes."
4092,III,"The Shadow was there, and its precise"
4093,III,"Outline etched the cold, white wall."
4094,III,"The young man swore, ""By God!  You, Paul,"
4095,III,There's something the matter with your brain.
4096,III,"Go home now and sleep off the strain."""
4097,III,
4098,III,
4099,III,"The next day was a storm, the rain"
4100,III,Whispered and scratched at the window-pane.
4101,III,A grey and shadowless morning filled
4102,III,"The little shop.  The watches, chilled,"
4103,III,Were dead and sparkless as burnt-out coals.
4104,III,The gems lay on the table like shoals
4105,III,"Of stranded shells, their colours faded,"
4106,III,"Mere heaps of stone, dull and degraded."
4107,III,"Paul's head was heavy, his hands obeyed"
4108,III,"No orders, for his fancy strayed."
4109,III,His work became a simple round
4110,III,Of watches repaired and watches wound.
4111,III,The slanting ribbons of the rain
4112,III,"Broke themselves on the window-pane,"
4113,III,But Paul saw the silver lines in vain.
4114,III,Only when the candle was lit
4115,III,And on the wall just opposite
4116,III,"He watched again the coming of _it_,"
4117,III,Could he trace a line for the joy of his soul
4118,III,And over his hands regain control.
4119,III,
4120,III,
4121,III,Paul lingered late in his shop that night
4122,III,And the designs which his delight
4123,III,Sketched on paper seemed to be
4124,III,A tribute offered wistfully
4125,III,To the beautiful shadow of her who came
4126,III,And hovered over his candle flame.
4127,III,In the morning he selected all
4128,III,His perfect jacinths.  One large opal
4129,III,"Hung like a milky, rainbow moon"
4130,III,"In the centre, and blown in loose festoon"
4131,III,The red stones quivered on silver threads
4132,III,"To the outer edge, where a single, fine"
4133,III,Band of mother-of-pearl the line
4134,III,"Completed.  On the other side,"
4135,III,The creamy porcelain of the face
4136,III,"Bore diamond hours, and no lace"
4137,III,Of cotton or silk could ever be
4138,III,Tossed into being more airily
4139,III,Than the filmy golden hands; the time
4140,III,Seemed to tick away in rhyme.
4141,III,"When, at dusk, the Shadow grew"
4142,III,"Upon the wall, Paul's work was through."
4143,III,"Holding the watch, he spoke to her:"
4144,III,"""Lady, Beautiful Shadow, stir"
4145,III,Into one brief sign of being.
4146,III,"Turn your eyes this way, and seeing"
4147,III,"This watch, made from those sweet curves"
4148,III,"Where your hair from your forehead swerves,"
4149,III,Accept the gift which I have wrought
4150,III,With your fairness in my thought.
4151,III,"Grant me this, and I shall be"
4152,III,"Honoured overwhelmingly."""
4153,III,
4154,III,"The Shadow rested black and still,"
4155,III,And the wind sighed over the window-sill.
4156,III,
4157,III,
4158,III,Paul put the despised watch away
4159,III,And laid out before him his array
4160,III,"Of stones and metals, and when the morning"
4161,III,"Struck the stones to their best adorning,"
4162,III,"He chose the brightest, and this new watch"
4163,III,Was so light and thin it seemed to catch
4164,III,"The sunlight's nothingness, and its gleam."
4165,III,Topazes ran in a foamy stream
4166,III,"Over the cover, the hands were studded"
4167,III,"With garnets, and seemed red roses, budded."
4168,III,"The face was of crystal, and engraved"
4169,III,Upon it the figures flashed and waved
4170,III,"With zircons, and beryls, and amethysts."
4171,III,"It took a week to make, and his trysts"
4172,III,At night with the Shadow were his alone.
4173,III,Paul swore not to speak till his task was done.
4174,III,The night that the jewel was worthy to give.
4175,III,Paul watched the long hours of daylight live
4176,III,"To the faintest streak; then lit his light,"
4177,III,And sharp against the wall's pure white
4178,III,The outline of the Shadow started
4179,III,Into form.  His burning-hearted
4180,III,Words so long imprisoned swelled
4181,III,"To tumbling speech.  Like one compelled,"
4182,III,"He told the lady all his love,"
4183,III,And holding out the watch above
4184,III,"His head, he knelt, imploring some"
4185,III,Littlest sign.
4186,III,The Shadow was dumb.
4187,III,
4188,III,
4189,III,"Weeks passed, Paul worked in fevered haste,"
4190,III,And everything he made he placed
4191,III,Before his lady.  The Shadow kept
4192,III,Its perfect passiveness.  Paul wept.
4193,III,"He wooed her with the work of his hands,"
4194,III,He waited for those dear commands
4195,III,"She never gave.  No word, no motion,"
4196,III,Eased the ache of his devotion.
4197,III,"His days passed in a strain of toil,"
4198,III,His nights burnt up in a seething coil.
4199,III,"Seasons shot by, uncognisant"
4200,III,He worked.  The Shadow came to haunt
4201,III,Even his days.  Sometimes quite plain
4202,III,He saw on the wall the blackberry stain
4203,III,Of his lady's picture.  No sun was bright
4204,III,Enough to dazzle that from his sight.
4205,III,
4206,III,
4207,III,There were moments when he groaned to see
4208,III,"His life spilled out so uselessly,"
4209,III,"Begging for boons the Shade refused,"
4210,III,"His finest workmanship abused,"
4211,III,The iridescent bubbles he blew
4212,III,"Into lovely existence, poor and few"
4213,III,In the shadowed eyes.  Then he would curse
4214,III,Himself and her!  The Universe!
4215,III,"And more, the beauty he could not make,"
4216,III,"And give her, for her comfort's sake!"
4217,III,"He would beat his weary, empty hands"
4218,III,"Upon the table, would hold up strands"
4219,III,"Of silver and gold, and ask her why"
4220,III,She scorned the best which he could buy.
4221,III,"He would pray as to some high-niched saint,"
4222,III,That she would cure him of the taint
4223,III,Of failure.  He would clutch the wall
4224,III,"With his bleeding fingers, if she should fall"
4225,III,"He could catch, and hold her, and make her live!"
4226,III,With sobs he would ask her to forgive
4227,III,"All he had done.  And broken, spent,"
4228,III,He would call himself impertinent;
4229,III,Presumptuous; a tradesman; a nothing; driven
4230,III,To madness by the sight of Heaven.
4231,III,At other times he would take the things
4232,III,"He had made, and winding them on strings,"
4233,III,"Hang garlands before her, and burn perfumes,"
4234,III,"Chanting strangely, while the fumes"
4235,III,"Wreathed and blotted the shadow face,"
4236,III,"As with a cloudy, nacreous lace."
4237,III,"There were days when he wooed as a lover, sighed"
4238,III,"In tenderness, spoke to his bride,"
4239,III,"Urged her to patience, said his skill"
4240,III,Should break the spell.  A man's sworn will
4241,III,"Could compass life, even that, he knew."
4242,III,By Christ's Blood!  He would prove it true!
4243,III,
4244,III,The edge of the Shadow never blurred.
4245,III,The lips of the Shadow never stirred.
4246,III,
4247,III,
4248,III,"He would climb on chairs to reach her lips,"
4249,III,And pat her hair with his finger-tips.
4250,III,"But instead of young, warm flesh returning"
4251,III,"His warmth, the wall was cold and burning"
4252,III,"Like stinging ice, and his passion, chilled,"
4253,III,Lay in his heart like some dead thing killed
4254,III,"At the moment of birth.  Then, deadly sick,"
4255,III,"He would lie in a swoon for hours, while thick"
4256,III,"Phantasmagoria crowded his brain,"
4257,III,And his body shrieked in the clutch of pain.
4258,III,"The crisis passed, he would wake and smile"
4259,III,"With a vacant joy, half-imbecile"
4260,III,"And quite confused, not being certain"
4261,III,Why he was suffering; a curtain
4262,III,Fallen over the tortured mind beguiled
4263,III,His sorrow.  Like a little child
4264,III,"He would play with his watches and gems, with glee"
4265,III,Calling the Shadow to look and see
4266,III,How the spots on the ceiling danced prettily
4267,III,"When he flashed his stones.  ""Mother, the green"
4268,III,Has slid so cunningly in between
4269,III,"The blue and the yellow.  Oh, please look down!"""
4270,III,"Then, with a pitiful, puzzled frown,"
4271,III,He would get up slowly from his play
4272,III,"And walk round the room, feeling his way"
4273,III,"From table to chair, from chair to door,"
4274,III,"Stepping over the cracks in the floor,"
4275,III,"Till reaching the table again, her face"
4276,III,"Would bring recollection, and no solace"
4277,III,Could balm his hurt till unconsciousness
4278,III,Stifled him and his great distress.
4279,III,
4280,III,
4281,III,One morning he threw the street door wide
4282,III,"On coming in, and his vigorous stride"
4283,III,Made the tools on his table rattle and jump.
4284,III,In his hands he carried a new-burst clump
4285,III,"Of laurel blossoms, whose smooth-barked stalks"
4286,III,Were pliant with sap.  As a husband talks
4287,III,"To the wife he left an hour ago,"
4288,III,"Paul spoke to the Shadow.  ""Dear, you know"
4289,III,"To-day the calendar calls it Spring,"
4290,III,And I woke this morning gathering
4291,III,"Asphodels, in my dreams, for you."
4292,III,So I rushed out to see what flowers blew
4293,III,Their pink-and-purple-scented souls
4294,III,"Across the town-wind's dusty scrolls,"
4295,III,And made the approach to the Market Square
4296,III,A garden with smells and sunny air.
4297,III,"I feel so well and happy to-day,"
4298,III,I think I shall take a Holiday.
4299,III,And to-night we will have a little treat.
4300,III,"I am going to bring you something to eat!"""
4301,III,He looked at the Shadow anxiously.
4302,III,It was quite grave and silent.  He
4303,III,Shut the outer door and came
4304,III,And leant against the window-frame.
4305,III,"""Dearest,"" he said, ""we live apart"
4306,III,Although I bear you in my heart.
4307,III,We look out each from a different world.
4308,III,At any moment we may be hurled
4309,III,"Asunder.  They follow their orbits, we"
4310,III,Obey their laws entirely.
4311,III,"Now you must come, or I go there,"
4312,III,Unless we are willing to live the flare
4313,III,"Of a lighted instant and have it gone."""
4314,III,
4315,III,A bee in the laurels began to drone.
4316,III,A loosened petal fluttered prone.
4317,III,
4318,III,"""Man grows by eating, if you eat"
4319,III,"You will be filled with our life, sweet"
4320,III,Will be our planet in your mouth.
4321,III,"If not, I must parch in death's wide drouth"
4322,III,"Until I gain to where you are,"
4323,III,And give you myself in whatever star
4324,III,May happen.  O You Beloved of Me!
4325,III,"Is it not ordered cleverly?"""
4326,III,
4327,III,"The Shadow, bloomed like a plum, and clear,"
4328,III,Hung in the sunlight.  It did not hear.
4329,III,
4330,III,
4331,III,Paul slipped away as the dusk began
4332,III,To dim the little shop.  He ran
4333,III,"To the nearest inn, and chose with care"
4334,III,As much as his thin purse could bear.
4335,III,As rapt-souled monks watch over the baking
4336,III,"Of the sacred wafer, and through the making"
4337,III,Of the holy wine whisper secret prayers
4338,III,That God will bless this labour of theirs;
4339,III,"So Paul, in a sober ecstasy,"
4340,III,Purchased the best which he could buy.
4341,III,"Returning, he brushed his tools aside,"
4342,III,And laid across the table a wide
4343,III,Napkin.  He put a glass and plate
4344,III,"On either side, in duplicate."
4345,III,"Over the lady's, excellent"
4346,III,"With loveliness, the laurels bent."
4347,III,"In the centre the white-flaked pastry stood,"
4348,III,And beside it the wine flask.  Red as blood
4349,III,Was the wine which should bring the lustihood
4350,III,Of human life to his lady's veins.
4351,III,"When all was ready, all which pertains"
4352,III,"To a simple meal was there, with eyes"
4353,III,"Lit by the joy of his great emprise,"
4354,III,"He reverently bade her come,"
4355,III,And forsake for him her distant home.
4356,III,"He put meat on her plate and filled her glass,"
4357,III,And waited what should come to pass.
4358,III,
4359,III,The Shadow lay quietly on the wall.
4360,III,From the street outside came a watchman's call
4361,III,"""A cloudy night.  Rain beginning to fall."""
4362,III,
4363,III,And still he waited.  The clock's slow tick
4364,III,Knocked on the silence.  Paul turned sick.
4365,III,
4366,III,He filled his own glass full of wine;
4367,III,From his pocket he took a paper.  The twine
4368,III,"Was knotted, and he searched a knife"
4369,III,From his jumbled tools.  The cord of life
4370,III,Snapped as he cut the little string.
4371,III,He knew that he must do the thing
4372,III,"He feared.  He shook powder into the wine,"
4373,III,And holding it up so the candle's shine
4374,III,"Sparked a ruby through its heart,"
4375,III,"He drank it.  ""Dear, never apart"
4376,III,Again!  You have said it was mine to do.
4377,III,"It is done, and I am come to you!"""
4378,III,
4379,III,
4380,III,"Paul Jannes let the empty wine-glass fall,"
4381,III,And held out his arms.  The insentient wall
4382,III,"Stared down at him with its cold, white glare"
4383,III,Unstained!  The Shadow was not there!
4384,III,Paul clutched and tore at his tightening throat.
4385,III,"He felt the veins in his body bloat,"
4386,III,And the hot blood run like fire and stones
4387,III,Along the sides of his cracking bones.
4388,III,"But he laughed as he staggered towards the door,"
4389,III,And he laughed aloud as he sank on the floor.
4390,III,
4391,III,
4392,III,
4393,III,"The Coroner took the body away,"
4394,III,And the watches were sold that Saturday.
4395,III,The Auctioneer said one could seldom buy
4396,III,"Such watches, and the prices were high."
4397,III,
4398,III,
4399,III,
4400,III,
4401,III,The Forsaken
4402,III,
4403,III,
4404,III,
4405,III,"Holy Mother of God, Merciful Mary.  Hear me!  I am very weary.  I have come"
4406,III,"from a village miles away, all day I have been coming, and I ache for such"
4407,III,"far roaming.  I cannot walk as light as I used, and my thoughts grow confused."
4408,III,"I am heavier than I was.  Mary Mother, you know the cause!"
4409,III,
4410,III,
4411,III,"Beautiful Holy Lady, take my shame away from me!  Let this fear"
4412,III,"be only seeming, let it be that I am dreaming.  For months I have hoped"
4413,III,"it was so, now I am afraid I know.  Lady, why should this be shame,"
4414,III,"just because I haven't got his name.  He loved me, yes, Lady, he did,"
4415,III,and he couldn't keep it hid.  We meant to marry.  Why did he die?
4416,III,
4417,III,
4418,III,"That day when they told me he had gone down in the avalanche, and could not"
4419,III,"be found until the snow melted in Spring, I did nothing.  I could not cry."
4420,III,Why should he die?  Why should he die and his child live?  His little child
4421,III,"alive in me, for my comfort.  No, Good God, for my misery!  I cannot face"
4422,III,"the shame, to be a mother, and not married, and the poor child to be reviled"
4423,III,"for having no father.  Merciful Mother, Holy Virgin, take away this sin I did."
4424,III,Let the baby not be.  Only take the stigma off of me!
4425,III,
4426,III,
4427,III,"I have told no one but you, Holy Mary.  My mother would call me ""whore"","
4428,III,"and spit upon me; the priest would have me repent, and have"
4429,III,"the rest of my life spent in a convent.  I am no whore, no bad woman,"
4430,III,"he loved me, and we were to be married.  I carried him always in my heart,"
4431,III,"what did it matter if I gave him the least part of me too?  You were a virgin,"
4432,III,"Holy Mother, but you had a son, you know there are times when a woman"
4433,III,must give all.  There is some call to give and hold back nothing.
4434,III,"I swear I obeyed God then, and this child who lives in me is the sign."
4435,III,"What am I saying?  He is dead, my beautiful, strong man!  I shall never"
4436,III,feel him caress me again.  This is the only baby I shall have.
4437,III,"Oh, Holy Virgin, protect my baby!  My little, helpless baby!"
4438,III,
4439,III,
4440,III,"He will look like his father, and he will be as fast a runner and as good"
4441,III,a shot.  Not that he shall be no scholar neither.  He shall go to school
4442,III,"in winter, and learn to read and write, and my father will teach him to carve,"
4443,III,"so that he can make the little horses, and cows, and chamois,"
4444,III,"out of white wood.  Oh, No!  No!  No!  How can I think such things,"
4445,III,"I am not good.  My father will have nothing to do with my boy,"
4446,III,"I shall be an outcast thing.  Oh, Mother of our Lord God, be merciful,"
4447,III,take away my shame!  Let my body be as it was before he came.
4448,III,No little baby for me to keep underneath my heart for those long months.
4449,III,To live for and to get comfort from.  I cannot go home and tell my mother.
4450,III,"She is so hard and righteous.  She never loved my father, and we were born"
4451,III,"for duty, not for love.  I cannot face it.  Holy Mother, take my baby away!"
4452,III,"Take away my little baby!  I don't want it, I can't bear it!"
4453,III,
4454,III,
4455,III,"And I shall have nothing, nothing!  Just be known as a good girl."
4456,III,"Have other men want to marry me, whom I could not touch, after having known"
4457,III,"my man.  Known the length and breadth of his beautiful white body,"
4458,III,"and the depth of his love, on the high Summer Alp, with the moon above,"
4459,III,"and the pine-needles all shiny in the light of it.  He is gone, my man,"
4460,III,"I shall never hear him or feel him again, but I could not touch another."
4461,III,I would rather lie under the snow with my own man in my arms!
4462,III,
4463,III,
4464,III,So I shall live on and on.  Just a good woman.  With nothing to warm my heart
4465,III,"where he lay, and where he left his baby for me to care for.  I shall not be"
4466,III,"quite human, I think.  Merely a stone-dead creature.  They will respect me."
4467,III,What do I care for respect!  You didn't care for people's tongues
4468,III,"when you were carrying our Lord Jesus.  God had my man give me my baby,"
4469,III,"when He knew that He was going to take him away.  His lips will comfort me,"
4470,III,"his hands will soothe me.  All day I will work at my lace-making,"
4471,III,and all night I will keep him warm by my side and pray the blessed Angels
4472,III,"to cover him with their wings.  Dear Mother, what is it that sings?"
4473,III,"I hear voices singing, and lovely silver trumpets through it all.  They seem"
4474,III,"just on the other side of the wall.  Let me keep my baby, Holy Mother."
4475,III,"He is only a poor lace-maker's baby, with a stain upon him,"
4476,III,but give me strength to bring him up to be a man.
4477,III,
4478,III,
4479,III,
4480,III,
4481,III,Late September
4482,III,
4483,III,
4484,III,
4485,III,Tang of fruitage in the air;
4486,III,Red boughs bursting everywhere;
4487,III,Shimmering of seeded grass;
4488,III,Hooded gentians all a'mass.
4489,III,
4490,III,"Warmth of earth, and cloudless wind"
4491,III,"Tearing off the husky rind,"
4492,III,Blowing feathered seeds to fall
4493,III,"By the sun-baked, sheltering wall."
4494,III,
4495,III,Beech trees in a golden haze;
4496,III,"Hardy sumachs all ablaze,"
4497,III,Glowing through the silver birches.
4498,III,How that pine tree shouts and lurches!
4499,III,
4500,III,"From the sunny door-jamb high,"
4501,III,Swings the shell of a butterfly.
4502,III,Scrape of insect violins
4503,III,Through the stubble shrilly dins.
4504,III,
4505,III,Every blade's a minaret
4506,III,"Where a small muezzin's set,"
4507,III,Loudly calling us to pray
4508,III,At the miracle of day.
4509,III,
4510,III,Then the purple-lidded night
4511,III,"Westering comes, her footsteps light"
4512,III,Guided by the radiant boon
4513,III,Of a sickle-shaped new moon.
4514,III,
4515,III,
4516,III,
4517,III,
4518,III,The Pike
4519,III,
4520,III,
4521,III,
4522,III,"In the brown water,"
4523,III,"Thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine,"
4524,III,"Liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds,"
4525,III,A pike dozed.
4526,III,Lost among the shadows of stems
4527,III,He lay unnoticed.
4528,III,"Suddenly he flicked his tail,"
4529,III,And a green-and-copper brightness
4530,III,Ran under the water.
4531,III,
4532,III,Out from under the reeds
4533,III,"Came the olive-green light,"
4534,III,And orange flashed up
4535,III,Through the sun-thickened water.
4536,III,"So the fish passed across the pool,"
4537,III,"Green and copper,"
4538,III,"A darkness and a gleam,"
4539,III,And the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank
4540,III,Received it.
4541,III,
4542,III,
4543,III,
4544,III,
4545,III,The Blue Scarf
4546,III,
4547,III,
4548,III,
4549,III,"Pale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded"
4550,III,"In smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes,"
4551,III,"it lies there,"
4552,III,"Warm from a woman's soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, caressing."
4553,III,"Where is she, the woman who wore it?  The scent of her lingers and drugs me!"
4554,III,"A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush the scarf down"
4555,III,"on my face,"
4556,III,"And gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim"
4557,III,in cool-tinted heavens.
4558,III,"Around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement."
4559,III,Rose-leaves blow and patter against it.  Below the stone steps a lute tinkles.
4560,III,A jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor.  A big-bellied
4561,III,"Frog hops through the sunlight and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin,"
4562,III,Sunk in the black and white marble.  The west wind has lifted a scarf
4563,III,"On the seat close beside me, the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour."
4564,III,"She draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath"
4565,III,her slight stirring.
4566,III,"Her kisses are sharp buds of fire; and I burn back against her, a jewel"
4567,III,"Hard and white; a stalked, flaming flower; till I break to"
4568,III,"a handful of cinders,"
4569,III,"And open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon sunshine."
4570,III,
4571,III,"How loud clocks can tick when a room is empty, and one is alone!"

4575,III,
4576,III,White and Green
4577,III,
4578,III,
4579,III,
4580,III,"Hey!  My daffodil-crowned,"
4581,III,Slim and without sandals!
4582,III,As the sudden spurt of flame upon darkness
4583,III,"So my eyeballs are startled with you,"
4584,III,"Supple-limbed youth among the fruit-trees,"
4585,III,Light runner through tasselled orchards.
4586,III,You are an almond flower unsheathed
4587,III,Leaping and flickering between the budded branches.
4588,III,
4589,III,
4590,III,
4591,III,
4592,III,Aubade
4593,III,
4594,III,
4595,III,
4596,III,As I would free the white almond from the green husk
4597,III,"So would I strip your trappings off,"
4598,III,Beloved.
4599,III,And fingering the smooth and polished kernel
4600,III,I should see that in my hands glittered a gem beyond counting.

4606,III,
4607,III,
4608,III,
4609,III,The neighbour sits in his window and plays the flute.
4610,III,"From my bed I can hear him,"
4611,III,"And the round notes flutter and tap about the room,"
4612,III,"And hit against each other,"
4613,III,Blurring to unexpected chords.
4614,III,"It is very beautiful,"
4615,III,"With the little flute-notes all about me,"
4616,III,In the darkness.
4617,III,
4618,III,"In the daytime,"
4619,III,The neighbour eats bread and onions with one hand
4620,III,And copies music with the other.
4621,III,"He is fat and has a bald head,"
4622,III,"So I do not look at him,"
4623,III,But run quickly past his window.
4624,III,"There is always the sky to look at,"
4625,III,Or the water in the well!
4626,III,
4627,III,"But when night comes and he plays his flute,"
4628,III,"I think of him as a young man,"
4629,III,"With gold seals hanging from his watch,"
4630,III,And a blue coat with silver buttons.
4631,III,As I lie in my bed
4632,III,"The flute-notes push against my ears and lips,"
4633,III,"And I go to sleep, dreaming."

4637,III,
4638,III,A Lady
4639,III,
4640,III,
4641,III,
4642,III,You are beautiful and faded
4643,III,Like an old opera tune
4644,III,Played upon a harpsichord;
4645,III,Or like the sun-flooded silks
4646,III,Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.
4647,III,In your eyes
4648,III,"Smoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes,"
4649,III,And the perfume of your soul
4650,III,"Is vague and suffusing,"
4651,III,With the pungence of sealed spice-jars.
4652,III,"Your half-tones delight me,"
4653,III,And I grow mad with gazing
4654,III,At your blent colours.
4655,III,
4656,III,"My vigour is a new-minted penny,"
4657,III,Which I cast at your feet.
4658,III,"Gather it up from the dust,"
4659,III,That its sparkle may amuse you.
4660,III,

4663,III,
4664,III,In a Garden
4665,III,
4666,III,
4667,III,
4668,III,Gushing from the mouths of stone men
4669,III,To spread at ease under the sky
4670,III,"In granite-lipped basins,"
4671,III,Where iris dabble their feet
4672,III,"And rustle to a passing wind,"
4673,III,"The water fills the garden with its rushing,"
4674,III,In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns.
4675,III,
4676,III,"Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,"
4677,III,"Where trickle and plash the fountains,"
4678,III,"Marble fountains, yellowed with much water."
4679,III,
4680,III,Splashing down moss-tarnished steps
4681,III,"It falls, the water;"
4682,III,And the air is throbbing with it.
4683,III,With its gurgling and running.
4684,III,"With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur."
4685,III,
4686,III,And I wished for night and you.
4687,III,"I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,"
4688,III,White and shining in the silver-flecked water.
4689,III,"While the moon rode over the garden,"
4690,III,"High in the arch of night,"
4691,III,And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness.
4692,III,
4693,III,"Night, and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing!"

4701,III,
4702,III,"Guarded within the old red wall's embrace,"
4703,III,"Marshalled like soldiers in gay company,"
4704,III,The tulips stand arrayed.  Here infantry
4705,III,Wheels out into the sunlight.  What bold grace
4706,III,"Sets off their tunics, white with crimson lace!"
4707,III,"Here are platoons of gold-frocked cavalry,"
4708,III,With scarlet sabres tossing in the eye
4709,III,"Of purple batteries, every gun in place."
4710,III,"Forward they come, with flaunting colours spread,"
4711,III,"With torches burning, stepping out in time"
4712,III,"To some quick, unheard march.  Our ears are dead,"
4713,III,We cannot catch the tune.  In pantomime
4714,III,Parades that army.  With our utmost powers
4715,III,We hear the wind stream through a bed of flowers.

4787,III,

4792,III,"Lowell, Amy.  Born in Brookline, Mass., Feb. 9, 1874. Educated at"
4793,III,"private schools.  Author of ""A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass"", 1912;"
4794,III,"""Sword Blades and Poppy Seed"", 1914; ""Men, Women and Ghosts"", 1916; ""Can"
4795,III,"Grande's Castle"", 1918; ""Pictures of the Floating World"", 1919. Editor"
4796,III,"of the three successive collections of ""Some Imagist Poets"", 1915, '16,"
4797,III,"and '17, containing the early work of the ""Imagist School"" of which Miss"
4798,III,"Lowell became the leader.  This movement,... originated in England,"
4799,III,"the idea have been first conceived by a young poet named T. E. Hulme,"
4800,III,"but developed and put forth by Ezra Pound in an article called ""Don'ts"
4801,III,"by an Imagist"", which appeared in `Poetry; A Magazine of Verse'. ..."
4802,III,"A small group of poets gathered about Mr. Pound, experimenting along the"
4803,III,"technical lines suggested, and a cult of ""Imagism"" was formed, whose"
4804,III,"first group-expression was in the little volume, ""Des Imagistes"","
4805,III,"published in New York in April, 1914. Miss Lowell did not come actively"
4806,III,"into the movement until after that time, but once she had entered it,"
4807,III,"she became its leader, and it was chiefly through her effort in America"
4808,III,that the movement attained so much prominence and so influenced the
4809,III,trend of poetry for the years immediately succeeding. Miss Lowell many
4810,III,"times, in admirable articles, stated the principles upon which Imagism"
4811,III,"is based, notably in the Preface to ""Some Imagist Poets"" and in the"
4812,III,"Preface to the second series, in 1916.  She also elaborated it much more"
4813,III,"fully in her volume, ""Tendencies in Modern American Poetry"", 1917, in"
4814,III,"the articles pertaining to the work of ""H.D."" and John Gould Fletcher."
4815,III,"In her own creative work, however, Miss Lowell did most to establish the"
4816,III,"possibilities of the Imagistic idea and of its modes of presentation,"
4817,III,"and opened up many interesting avenues of poetic form.  Her volume, ""Can"
4818,III,"Grande's Castle"", is devoted to work in the medium which she styled"
4819,III,"""Polyphonic Prose"" and contains some of her finest work, particularly"
4820,III,"""The Bronze Horses""."
