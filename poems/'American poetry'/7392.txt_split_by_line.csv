80,BILL AND JOE,
81,BILL AND JOE,"COME, dear old comrade, you and I"
82,BILL AND JOE,"Will steal an hour from days gone by,"
83,BILL AND JOE,"The shining days when life was new,"
84,BILL AND JOE,"And all was bright with morning dew,"
85,BILL AND JOE,"The lusty days of long ago,"
86,BILL AND JOE,When you were Bill and I was Joe.
87,BILL AND JOE,
88,BILL AND JOE,Your name may flaunt a titled trail
89,BILL AND JOE,"Proud as a cockerel's rainbow tail,"
90,BILL AND JOE,And mine as brief appendix wear
91,BILL AND JOE,As Tam O'Shanter's luckless mare;
92,BILL AND JOE,"To-day, old friend, remember still"
93,BILL AND JOE,That I am Joe and you are Bill.
94,BILL AND JOE,
95,BILL AND JOE,"You've won the great world's envied prize,"
96,BILL AND JOE,"And grand you look in people's eyes,"
97,BILL AND JOE,With H O N. and L L. D.
98,BILL AND JOE,"In big brave letters, fair to see,--"
99,BILL AND JOE,"Your fist, old fellow! off they go!--"
100,BILL AND JOE,"How are you, Bill? How are you, Joe?"
101,BILL AND JOE,
102,BILL AND JOE,You've worn the judge's ermined robe;
103,BILL AND JOE,You 've taught your name to half the globe;
104,BILL AND JOE,You've sung mankind a deathless strain;
105,BILL AND JOE,You've made the dead past live again
106,BILL AND JOE,"The world may call you what it will,"
107,BILL AND JOE,But you and I are Joe and Bill.
108,BILL AND JOE,
109,BILL AND JOE,The chaffing young folks stare and say
110,BILL AND JOE,"""See those old buffers, bent and gray,--"
111,BILL AND JOE,They talk like fellows in their teens!
112,BILL AND JOE,"Mad, poor old boys! That's what it means,""--"
113,BILL AND JOE,And shake their heads; they little know
114,BILL AND JOE,The throbbing hearts of Bill and Joe!--
115,BILL AND JOE,
116,BILL AND JOE,"How Bill forgets his hour of pride,"
117,BILL AND JOE,While Joe sits smiling at his side;
118,BILL AND JOE,"How Joe, in spite of time's disguise,"
119,BILL AND JOE,"Finds the old schoolmate in his eyes,--"
120,BILL AND JOE,"Those calm, stern eyes that melt and fill"
121,BILL AND JOE,As Joe looks fondly up at Bill.
122,BILL AND JOE,
123,BILL AND JOE,"Ah, pensive scholar, what is fame?"
124,BILL AND JOE,A fitful tongue of leaping flame;
125,BILL AND JOE,"A giddy whirlwind's fickle gust,"
126,BILL AND JOE,That lifts a pinch of mortal dust;
127,BILL AND JOE,"A few swift years, and who can show"
128,BILL AND JOE,Which dust was Bill and which was Joe?
129,BILL AND JOE,
130,BILL AND JOE,"The weary idol takes his stand,"
131,BILL AND JOE,"Holds out his bruised and aching hand,"
132,BILL AND JOE,"While gaping thousands come and go,--"
133,BILL AND JOE,"How vain it seems, this empty show!"
134,BILL AND JOE,Till all at once his pulses thrill;--
135,BILL AND JOE,"'T is poor old Joe's ""God bless you, Bill!"""
136,BILL AND JOE,
137,BILL AND JOE,And shall we breathe in happier spheres
138,BILL AND JOE,The names that pleased our mortal ears;
139,BILL AND JOE,In some sweet lull of harp and song
140,BILL AND JOE,"For earth-born spirits none too long,"
141,BILL AND JOE,Just whispering of the world below
142,BILL AND JOE,Where this was Bill and that was Joe?
143,BILL AND JOE,
144,BILL AND JOE,No matter; while our home is here
145,BILL AND JOE,No sounding name is half so dear;
146,BILL AND JOE,"When fades at length our lingering day,"
147,BILL AND JOE,Who cares what pompous tombstones say?
148,BILL AND JOE,"Read on the hearts that love us still,"
149,BILL AND JOE,_Hic jacet_ Joe. _Hic jacet_ Bill.

1645,EVEN-SONG.,"An end to mortal things,"
1646,EVEN-SONG.,That sends the beggar Winter in the train
1647,EVEN-SONG.,"Of Autumn's burdened wain,--"
1648,EVEN-SONG.,"Time, that is heir of all our earthly state,"
1649,EVEN-SONG.,And knoweth well to wait
1650,EVEN-SONG.,"Till sea hath turned to shore and shore to sea,"
1651,EVEN-SONG.,"If so it need must be,"
1652,EVEN-SONG.,Ere he make good his claim and call his own
1653,EVEN-SONG.,"Old empires overthrown,--"
1654,EVEN-SONG.,"Time, who can find no heavenly orb too large"
1655,EVEN-SONG.,"To hold its fee in charge,"
1656,EVEN-SONG.,"Nor any motes that fill its beam so small,"
1657,EVEN-SONG.,"But he shall care for all,--"
1658,EVEN-SONG.,"It may be, must be,--yes, he soon shall tire"
1659,EVEN-SONG.,This hand that holds the lyre.
1660,EVEN-SONG.,
1661,EVEN-SONG.,Then ye who listened in that earlier day
1662,EVEN-SONG.,When to my careless lay
1663,EVEN-SONG.,"I matched its chords and stole their first-born thrill,"
1664,EVEN-SONG.,With untaught rudest skill
1665,EVEN-SONG.,Vexing a treble from the slender strings
1666,EVEN-SONG.,Thin as the locust sings
1667,EVEN-SONG.,When the shrill-crying child of summer's heat
1668,EVEN-SONG.,"Pipes from its leafy seat,"
1669,EVEN-SONG.,The dim pavilion of embowering green
1670,EVEN-SONG.,Beneath whose shadowy screen
1671,EVEN-SONG.,The small sopranist tries his single note
1672,EVEN-SONG.,"Against the song-bird's throat,"
1673,EVEN-SONG.,"And all the echoes listen, but in vain;"
1674,EVEN-SONG.,"They hear no answering strain,--"
1675,EVEN-SONG.,Then ye who listened in that earlier day
1676,EVEN-SONG.,"Shall sadly turn away,"
1677,EVEN-SONG.,
1678,EVEN-SONG.,"Saying, ""The fire burns low, the hearth is cold"
1679,EVEN-SONG.,That warmed our blood of old;
1680,EVEN-SONG.,"Cover its embers and its half-burnt brands,"
1681,EVEN-SONG.,And let us stretch our hands
1682,EVEN-SONG.,Over a brighter and fresh-kindled flame;
1683,EVEN-SONG.,"Lo, this is not the same,"
1684,EVEN-SONG.,"The joyous singer of our morning time,"
1685,EVEN-SONG.,Flushed high with lusty rhyme!
1686,EVEN-SONG.,"Speak kindly, for he bears a human heart,"
1687,EVEN-SONG.,"But whisper him apart,--"
1688,EVEN-SONG.,Tell him the woods their autumn robes have shed
1689,EVEN-SONG.,"And all their birds have fled,"
1690,EVEN-SONG.,And shouting winds unbuild the naked nests
1691,EVEN-SONG.,They warmed with patient breasts;

1694,EVEN-SONG.,
1695,EVEN-SONG.,"Ah, welladay! if words so cruel-kind"
1696,EVEN-SONG.,A listening ear might find!
1697,EVEN-SONG.,But who that hears the music in his soul
1698,EVEN-SONG.,Of rhythmic waves that roll
1699,EVEN-SONG.,"Crested with gleams of fire, and as they flow"
1700,EVEN-SONG.,Stir all the deeps below
1701,EVEN-SONG.,Till the great pearls no calm might ever reach
1702,EVEN-SONG.,"Leap glistening on the beach,--"
1703,EVEN-SONG.,"Who that has known the passion and the pain,"
1704,EVEN-SONG.,"The rush through heart and brain,"
1705,EVEN-SONG.,The joy so like a pang his hand is pressed
1706,EVEN-SONG.,"Hard on his throbbing breast,"
1707,EVEN-SONG.,"When thou, whose smile is life and bliss and fame"
1708,EVEN-SONG.,"Hast set his pulse aflame,"
1709,EVEN-SONG.,Muse of the lyre! can say farewell to thee?

1711,EVEN-SONG.,
1712,EVEN-SONG.,"In many a clime, in many a stately tongue,"
1713,EVEN-SONG.,The mighty bards have sung;
1714,EVEN-SONG.,To these the immemorial thrones belong
1715,EVEN-SONG.,And purple robes of song;
1716,EVEN-SONG.,Yet the slight minstrel loves the slender tone
1717,EVEN-SONG.,"His lips may call his own,"
1718,EVEN-SONG.,"And finds the measure of the verse more sweet,"
1719,EVEN-SONG.,"Timed by his pulse's beat,"
1720,EVEN-SONG.,Than all the hymnings of the laurelled throng.
1721,EVEN-SONG.,"Say not I do him wrong,"
1722,EVEN-SONG.,"For Nature spoils her warblers,--them she feeds"
1723,EVEN-SONG.,In lotus-growing meads
1724,EVEN-SONG.,And pours them subtle draughts from haunted streams
1725,EVEN-SONG.,That fill their souls with dreams.
1726,EVEN-SONG.,
1727,EVEN-SONG.,Full well I know the gracious mother's wiles
1728,EVEN-SONG.,And dear delusive smiles!
1729,EVEN-SONG.,No callow fledgling of her singing brood
1730,EVEN-SONG.,"But tastes that witching food,"
1731,EVEN-SONG.,"And hearing overhead the eagle's wing,"
1732,EVEN-SONG.,"And how the thrushes sing,"
1733,EVEN-SONG.,"Vents his exiguous chirp, and from his nest"
1734,EVEN-SONG.,Flaps forth--we know the rest.
1735,EVEN-SONG.,"I own the weakness of the tuneful kind,--"
1736,EVEN-SONG.,Are not all harpers blind?
1737,EVEN-SONG.,"I sang too early, must I sing too late?"
1738,EVEN-SONG.,The lengthening shadows wait
1739,EVEN-SONG.,"The first pale stars of twilight,--yet how sweet"
1740,EVEN-SONG.,"The flattering whisper's cheat,--"
1741,EVEN-SONG.,"""Thou hast the fire no evening chill can tame,"
1742,EVEN-SONG.,"Whose coals outlast its flame!"""
1743,EVEN-SONG.,
1744,EVEN-SONG.,"Farewell, ye carols of the laughing morn,"
1745,EVEN-SONG.,Of earliest sunshine born!
1746,EVEN-SONG.,The sower flings the seed and looks not back
1747,EVEN-SONG.,Along his furrowed track;
1748,EVEN-SONG.,The reaper leaves the stalks for other hands
1749,EVEN-SONG.,To gird with circling bands;
1750,EVEN-SONG.,"The wind, earth's careless servant, truant-born,"
1751,EVEN-SONG.,Blows clean the beaten corn
1752,EVEN-SONG.,"And quits the thresher's floor, and goes his way"
1753,EVEN-SONG.,To sport with ocean's spray;
1754,EVEN-SONG.,The headlong-stumbling rivulet scrambling down
1755,EVEN-SONG.,"To wash the sea-girt town,"
1756,EVEN-SONG.,Still babbling of the green and billowy waste
1757,EVEN-SONG.,"Whose salt he longs to taste,"
1758,EVEN-SONG.,Ere his warm wave its chilling clasp may feel
1759,EVEN-SONG.,Has twirled the miller's wheel.
1760,EVEN-SONG.,
1761,EVEN-SONG.,The song has done its task that makes us bold
1762,EVEN-SONG.,"With secrets else untold,--"
1763,EVEN-SONG.,And mine has run its errand; through the dews
1764,EVEN-SONG.,I tracked the flying Muse;
1765,EVEN-SONG.,The daughter of the morning touched my lips
1766,EVEN-SONG.,With roseate finger-tips;
1767,EVEN-SONG.,"Whether I would or would not, I must sing"
1768,EVEN-SONG.,With the new choirs of spring;
1769,EVEN-SONG.,"Now, as I watch the fading autumn day"
1770,EVEN-SONG.,"And trill my softened lay,"
1771,EVEN-SONG.,"I think of all that listened, and of one"
1772,EVEN-SONG.,For whom a brighter sun
1773,EVEN-SONG.,"Dawned at high summer's noon. Ah, comrades dear,"
1774,EVEN-SONG.,Are not all gathered here?
1775,EVEN-SONG.,Our hearts have answered.--Yes! they hear our call:

1783,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1784,THE SMILING LISTENER,1871
1785,THE SMILING LISTENER,PRECISELY. I see it. You all want to say
1786,THE SMILING LISTENER,That a tear is too sad and a laugh is too gay;
1787,THE SMILING LISTENER,"You could stand a faint smile, you could manage a sigh,"
1788,THE SMILING LISTENER,"But you value your ribs, and you don't want to cry."
1789,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1790,THE SMILING LISTENER,And why at our feast of the clasping of hands
1791,THE SMILING LISTENER,Need we turn on the stream of our lachrymal glands?
1792,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Though we see the white breakers of age on our bow,"
1793,THE SMILING LISTENER,Let us take a good pull in the jolly-boat now!
1794,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1795,THE SMILING LISTENER,It's hard if a fellow cannot feel content
1796,THE SMILING LISTENER,"When a banquet like this does n't cost him a cent,"
1797,THE SMILING LISTENER,"When his goblet and plate he may empty at will,"
1798,THE SMILING LISTENER,And our kind Class Committee will settle the bill.
1799,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1800,THE SMILING LISTENER,"And here's your old friend, the identical bard"
1801,THE SMILING LISTENER,Who has rhymed and recited you verse by the yard
1802,THE SMILING LISTENER,Since the days of the empire of Andrew the First
1803,THE SMILING LISTENER,Till you 're full to the brim and feel ready to burst.
1804,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1805,THE SMILING LISTENER,"It's awful to think of,--how year after year"
1806,THE SMILING LISTENER,With his piece in his pocket he waits for you here;
1807,THE SMILING LISTENER,"No matter who's missing, there always is one"
1808,THE SMILING LISTENER,"To lug out his manuscript, sure as a gun."
1809,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1810,THE SMILING LISTENER,"""Why won't he stop writing?"" Humanity cries"
1811,THE SMILING LISTENER,"The answer is briefly, ""He can't if he tries;"
1812,THE SMILING LISTENER,"He has played with his foolish old feather so long,"
1813,THE SMILING LISTENER,"That the goose-quill in spite of him cackles in song."""
1814,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1815,THE SMILING LISTENER,You have watched him with patience from morning to dusk
1816,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Since the tassel was bright o'er the green of the husk,"
1817,THE SMILING LISTENER,And now--it 's too bad--it 's a pitiful job--
1818,THE SMILING LISTENER,He has shelled the ripe ear till he's come to the cob.
1819,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1820,THE SMILING LISTENER,I see one face beaming--it listens so well
1821,THE SMILING LISTENER,There must be some music yet left in my shell--
1822,THE SMILING LISTENER,The wine of my soul is not thick on the lees;
1823,THE SMILING LISTENER,"One string is unbroken, one friend I can please!"
1824,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1825,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Dear comrade, the sunshine of seasons gone by"
1826,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Looks out from your tender and tear-moistened eye,"
1827,THE SMILING LISTENER,"A pharos of love on an ice-girdled coast,--"
1828,THE SMILING LISTENER,Kind soul!--Don't you hear me?--He's deaf as a post!
1829,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1830,THE SMILING LISTENER,Can it be one of Nature's benevolent tricks
1831,THE SMILING LISTENER,That you grow hard of hearing as I grow prolix?
1832,THE SMILING LISTENER,And that look of delight which would angels beguile
1833,THE SMILING LISTENER,Is the deaf man's prolonged unintelligent smile?
1834,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1835,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Ah! the ear may grow dull, and the eye may wax dim,"
1836,THE SMILING LISTENER,But they still know a classmate--they can't mistake him;
1837,THE SMILING LISTENER,"There is something to tell us, ""That's one of our band,"""
1838,THE SMILING LISTENER,Though we groped in the dark for a touch of his hand.
1839,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1840,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Well, Time with his snuffers is prowling about"
1841,THE SMILING LISTENER,And his shaky old fingers will soon snuff us out;
1842,THE SMILING LISTENER,"There's a hint for us all in each pendulum tick,"
1843,THE SMILING LISTENER,For we're low in the tallow and long in the wick.
1844,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1845,THE SMILING LISTENER,You remember Rossini--you 've been at the play?
1846,THE SMILING LISTENER,How his overture-endings keep crashing away
1847,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Till you think, ""It 's all over--it can't but stop now--"
1848,THE SMILING LISTENER,"That 's the screech and the bang of the final bow-wow."""
1849,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1850,THE SMILING LISTENER,"And you find you 're mistaken; there 's lots more to come,"
1851,THE SMILING LISTENER,"More banging, more screeching of fiddle and drum,"
1852,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Till when the last ending is finished and done,"
1853,THE SMILING LISTENER,You feel like a horse when the winning-post 's won.
1854,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1855,THE SMILING LISTENER,"So I, who have sung to you, merry or sad,"
1856,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Since the days when they called me a promising lad,"
1857,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Though I 've made you more rhymes than a tutor could scan,"
1858,THE SMILING LISTENER,"Have a few more still left, like the razor-strop man."
1859,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1860,THE SMILING LISTENER,Now pray don't be frightened--I 'm ready to stop
1861,THE SMILING LISTENER,My galloping anapests' clatter and pop--
1862,THE SMILING LISTENER,"In fact, if you say so, retire from to-day"
1863,THE SMILING LISTENER,"To the garret I left, on a poet's half-pay."
1864,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1865,THE SMILING LISTENER,And yet--I can't help it--perhaps--who can tell?
1866,THE SMILING LISTENER,"You might miss the poor singer you treated so well,"
1867,THE SMILING LISTENER,"And confess you could stand him five minutes or so,"
1868,THE SMILING LISTENER,"""It was so like old times we remember, you know."""
1869,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1870,THE SMILING LISTENER,"'T is not that the music can signify much,"
1871,THE SMILING LISTENER,"But then there are chords that awake with a touch,--"
1872,THE SMILING LISTENER,And our hearts can find echoes of sorrow and joy
1873,THE SMILING LISTENER,To the winch of the minstrel who hails from Savoy.
1874,THE SMILING LISTENER,
1875,THE SMILING LISTENER,So this hand-organ tune that I cheerfully grind
1876,THE SMILING LISTENER,"May bring the old places and faces to mind,"
1877,THE SMILING LISTENER,And seen in the light of the past we recall
1878,THE SMILING LISTENER,The flowers that have faded bloom fairest of all!
1879,THE SMILING LISTENER,

1899,J. A.,
1900,J. A.,Vain every pictured phrase to tell
1901,J. A.,"Our sorrowing heart's desire,--"
1902,J. A.,"The shattered harp, the broken shell,"
1903,J. A.,The silent unstrung lyre;
1904,J. A.,
1905,J. A.,For youth was round us while he sang;
1906,J. A.,It glowed in every tone;
1907,J. A.,"With bridal chimes the echoes rang,"
1908,J. A.,And made the past our own.
1909,J. A.,
1910,J. A.,Oh blissful dream! Our nursery joys
1911,J. A.,"We know must have an end,"
1912,J. A.,But love and friendship's broken toys
1913,J. A.,May God's good angels mend!
1914,J. A.,
1915,J. A.,"The cheering smile, the voice of mirth"
1916,J. A.,And laughter's gay surprise
1917,J. A.,That please the children born of earth.
1918,J. A.,Why deem that Heaven denies?
1919,J. A.,
1920,J. A.,Methinks in that refulgent sphere
1921,J. A.,"That knows not sun or moon,"
1922,J. A.,An earth-born saint might long to hear
1923,J. A.,"One verse of ""Bonny Doon "";"
1924,J. A.,
1925,J. A.,Or walking through the streets of gold
1926,J. A.,"In heaven's unclouded light,"
1927,J. A.,His lips recall the song of old
1928,J. A.,"And hum ""The sky is bright."""
1929,J. A.,
1930,J. A.,And can we smile when thou art dead?
1931,J. A.,"Ah, brothers, even so!"
1932,J. A.,"The rose of summer will be red,"
1933,J. A.,In spite of winter's snow.
1934,J. A.,
1935,J. A.,Thou wouldst not leave us all in gloom
1936,J. A.,"Because thy song is still,"

1940,J. A.,"The sighing wintry winds complain,--"
1941,J. A.,"The singing bird has flown,--"

1944,J. A.,
1945,J. A.,"How poor these pallid phrases seem,"

3085,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,1886
3086,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3087,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,THIS shred of song you bid me bring
3088,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Is snatched from fancy's embers;
3089,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"Ah, when the lips forget to sing,"
3090,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,The faithful heart remembers!
3091,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3092,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Too swift the wings of envious Time
3093,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"To wait for dallying phrases,"
3094,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Or woven strands of labored rhyme
3095,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,To thread their cunning mazes.
3096,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3097,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"A word, a sigh, and lo, how plain"
3098,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Its magic breath discloses
3099,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Our life's long vista through a lane
3100,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Of threescore summers' roses!
3101,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3102,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,One language years alone can teach
3103,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Its roots are young affections
3104,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That feel their way to simplest speech
3105,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Through silent recollections.
3106,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3107,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That tongue is ours. How few the words
3108,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,We need to know a brother!
3109,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"As simple are the notes of birds,"
3110,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Yet well they know each other.
3111,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3112,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,This freezing month of ice and snow
3113,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That brings our lives together
3114,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,Lends to our year a living glow
3115,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,That warms its wintry weather.
3116,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,
3117,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"So let us meet as eve draws nigh,"
3118,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"And life matures and mellows,"
3119,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"Till Nature whispers with a sigh,"
3120,THIRTY-SIXTH VARIATION,"""Good-night, my dear old fellows!"""

3129,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3130,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"I STOOD On Sarum's treeless plain,"
3131,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,The waste that careless Nature owns;
3132,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Lone tenants of her bleak domain,"
3133,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Loomed huge and gray the Druid stones.
3134,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3135,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Upheaved in many a billowy mound
3136,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"The sea-like, naked turf arose,"
3137,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Where wandering flocks went nibbling round
3138,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,The mingled graves of friends and foes.
3139,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3140,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"The Briton, Roman, Saxon, Dane,"
3141,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,This windy desert roamed in turn;
3142,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Unmoved these mighty blocks remain
3143,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Whose story none that lives may learn.
3144,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3145,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Erect, half buried, slant or prone,"
3146,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"These awful listeners, blind and dumb,"
3147,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Hear the strange tongues of tribes unknown,"
3148,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,As wave on wave they go and come.
3149,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3150,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""Who are you, giants, whence and why?"""
3151,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,I stand and ask in blank amaze;
3152,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,My soul accepts their mute reply
3153,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""A mystery, as are you that gaze."
3154,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3155,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""A silent Orpheus wrought the charm"
3156,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,From riven rocks their spoils to bring;
3157,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,A nameless Titan lent his arm
3158,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,To range us in our magic ring.
3159,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3160,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""But Time with still and stealthy stride,"
3161,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"That climbs and treads and levels all,"
3162,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"That bids the loosening keystone slide,"
3163,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"And topples down the crumbling wall,--"
3164,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3165,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""Time, that unbuilds the quarried past,"
3166,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Leans on these wrecks that press the sod;
3167,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"They slant, they stoop, they fall at last,"
3168,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,And strew the turf their priests have trod.
3169,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3170,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"""No more our altar's wreath of smoke"
3171,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Floats up with morning's fragrant dew;
3172,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"The fires are dead, the ring is broke,"
3173,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Where stood the many stand the few."""
3174,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3175,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"My thoughts had wandered far away,"
3176,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Borne off on Memory's outspread wing,"
3177,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,To where in deepening twilight lay
3178,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,The wrecks of friendship's broken ring.
3179,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3180,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Ah me! of all our goodly train
3181,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,How few will find our banquet hall!
3182,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Yet why with coward lips complain
3183,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"That this must lean, and that must fall?"
3184,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3185,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Cold is the Druid's altar-stone,"
3186,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Its vanished flame no more returns;
3187,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"But ours no chilling damp has known,--"
3188,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"Unchanged, unchanging, still it burns."
3189,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,
3190,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,So let our broken circle stand
3191,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"A wreck, a remnant, yet the same,"
3192,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,"While one last, loving, faithful hand"
3193,THE BROKEN CIRCLE,Still lives to feed its altar-flame!

3206,THE ANGEL-THIEF,"Strong locks are broken, massive bolts are drawn,"

3208,THE ANGEL-THIEF,"And all around are left the bars and borers,"
3209,THE ANGEL-THIEF,"The splitting wedges and the prying keys,"
3210,THE ANGEL-THIEF,Such aids as serve the soft-shod vault-explorers
3211,THE ANGEL-THIEF,"To crack, wrench open, rifle as they please."

3216,THE ANGEL-THIEF,To break the cramping fetters of our past.

3221,THE ANGEL-THIEF,Found in the wreck his ruthless hands have left.
3222,THE ANGEL-THIEF,
3223,THE ANGEL-THIEF,Some lever that a casket's hinge has broken
3224,THE ANGEL-THIEF,"Pries off a bolt, and lo! our souls are free;"

3226,THE ANGEL-THIEF,And every decade drops its master-key.

3242,AFTER THE CURFEW,"Yet lingers in the darkening hall,"
3243,AFTER THE CURFEW,I come to say a last Good-night
3244,AFTER THE CURFEW,Before the final _Exeunt all_.
3245,AFTER THE CURFEW,
3246,AFTER THE CURFEW,"We gathered once, a joyous throng:"
3247,AFTER THE CURFEW,The jovial toasts went gayly round;
3248,AFTER THE CURFEW,"With jest, and laugh, and shout, and song,"
3249,AFTER THE CURFEW,We made the floors and walls resound.
3250,AFTER THE CURFEW,
3251,AFTER THE CURFEW,"We come with feeble steps and slow,"
3252,AFTER THE CURFEW,"A little band of four or five,"
3253,AFTER THE CURFEW,"Left from the wrecks of long ago,"
3254,AFTER THE CURFEW,Still pleased to find ourselves alive.
3255,AFTER THE CURFEW,
3256,AFTER THE CURFEW,"Alive! How living, too, are they"
3257,AFTER THE CURFEW,Whose memories it is ours to share!

3274,AFTER THE CURFEW,"We see, we hear, no more below."

3276,AFTER THE CURFEW,"The air seems darkened by his loss,"
3277,AFTER THE CURFEW,"Earth's shadowed features look less fair,"
3278,AFTER THE CURFEW,And heavier weighs the daily cross
