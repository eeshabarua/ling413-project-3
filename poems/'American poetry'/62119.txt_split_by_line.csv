131,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK
132,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
133,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
134,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,In my rovings and ramblings as a boy I had often skirted the old stone
135,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,house in the hollow. But my first clear remembrance of it is of a hot
136,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,summer's day. I had climbed to the crest of a hill till then unknown to
137,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"me, and stood there, hot and breathless in the bright slippery grass,"
138,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,looking down on its grey walls and chimneys as if out of a dream. And
139,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,as if out of a dream already familiar to me.
140,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
141,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,My real intention in setting out from home that morning had been to
142,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,get to a place called East Dene. My mother had often spoken to me of
143,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"East Dene--of its trees and waters and green pastures, and the rare"
144,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"birds and flowers to be found there. Ages ago, she had told me, an"
145,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,ancestor of our family had dwelt in this place. But she smiled a little
146,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"strangely when I asked her to take me there. ""All in good time, my"
147,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"dear,"" she whispered into my ear, ""all in very good time! Just follow"
148,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"your small nose."" What kind of time, I wondered, was _very good time_."
149,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,And _follow my nose_--how far? Such reflections indeed only made me the
150,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,more anxious to be gone.
151,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
152,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Early that morning, then, I had started out when the dew was still"
153,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"sparkling, and the night mists had but just lifted. But my young legs"
154,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"soon tired of the steep, boulder-strown hills, the chalky ravines, and"
155,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"burning sun, and having, as I say, come into view of the house in the"
156,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"valley, I went no further. Instead, I sat down on the hot turf--the"
157,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"sweet smell of thyme in the air, a few harebells nodding around me--and"
158,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"stared, down and down."
159,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
160,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"After that first visit, scarcely a week passed but that I found myself"
161,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,on this hill again. The remembrance of the house stayed in my mind;
162,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"would keep returning to me, like a bird to its nest. Sometimes even in"
163,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the middle of the night I would wake up and lie unable to sleep again
164,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"for thinking of it--seeing it in my head; solemn, secret, strange."
165,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
166,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"There is a little flickering lizard called the Chameleon which, they"
167,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"say, changes its colour according to the place where it happens to be."
168,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,So with this house. It was never the same for two hours together. I
169,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,have seen it gathered close up in its hollow in the livid and coppery
170,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,gloom of storm; crouched like a hare in winter under a mask of snow;
171,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,dark and silent beneath the changing sparkle of the stars; and like
172,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,a palace out of an Arabian tale in the milky radiance of the moon.
173,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"THRAE was the name inscribed on its gateway, but in letters so"
174,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,faint and faded as to be almost illegible.
175,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
176,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"In a sense I was, I suppose, a trespasser in this Thrae; until at least"
177,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I became acquainted with Miss Taroone, the lady who lived in it. For"
178,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I made pretty free with her valley, paddled and fished in its stream,"
179,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and now and then helped myself to a windfall in her green bird-haunted
180,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"orchards, where grew a particularly sharp and bright-rinded apple of"
181,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"which I have never heard the name. As custom gave me confidence, I"
182,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,ventured nearer and nearer to the house and would sometimes take a
183,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"rest squatting on a manger in the big empty barn, looking out into"
184,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the sunshine. The wings of the flies shone like glass in its shafts
185,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of light, and the robins whistled under its timber roof so shrill as"
186,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,almost to deafen one's ears.
187,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
188,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Few strangers passed that way. Now and then I saw in the distance
189,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,what might have been a beggar. To judge from his bundle he must have
190,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"done pretty well at the house. Once, as I turned out of a little wood"
191,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of birches, I met a dreadful-faced man in the lane who lifted up his"
192,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"hand at sight of me, and with white glaring eyes, uttered a horrible"
193,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"imprecation. He was chewing some fruit stolen out of the orchard, and"
194,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,at the very sight of him I ran like Wat himself.
195,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
196,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Once, too, as my head looked over the hill-crest, there stood an old"
197,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,carriage and a drowsy horse drawn up beside the porch--with its slender
198,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"wooden pillars and a kind of tray above, on which rambled winter"
199,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"jasmine, tufts of self-sown weeds and Traveller's Joy. I edged near"
200,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,enough to see there was a crown emblazoned on the panel of the carriage
201,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"door. Nobody sat inside, and the coachman asleep on the box made me"
202,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,feel more solitary and inquisitive than ever.
203,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
204,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Yet in its time the old house must have seen plenty of company. Friends
205,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of later years have spoken to me of it. Indeed, not far distant from"
206,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Thrae as the crow flies, there was a crossing of high roads, so that"
207,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,any traveller from elsewhere not in haste could turn aside and examine
208,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the place if he cared for its looks and was in need of a night's
209,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,lodging. Yet I do not think many such travellers--if they were men
210,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,merely of the Town--can have _chosen_ to lift that knocker or to set
211,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,ringing that bell. To any one already lost and benighted its looks
212,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,must have been forbidding.
213,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
214,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Well, as I say, again and again, my lessons done, morning or evening"
215,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"would find me either on the grass slopes above Thrae, or actually in"
216,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"its valley. If I was tired, I would watch from a good distance off its"
217,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"small dark windows in their stone embrasures, and up above them the"
218,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,round greenish tower or turret over which a winged weather-vane twirled
219,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,with the wind. I might watch: but the only person that I ever actually
220,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"observed at the windows was an old maid with flaps to her cap, who"
221,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,would sometimes shake a duster out into the air as if for a signal to
222,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,someone up in the hills.
223,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
224,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Apart from her, I had occasionally seen Miss Taroone herself in the"
225,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"overgrown garden, with her immense shears, or with her trencher of"
226,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"bread-crumbs and other provender, feeding the birds. And I once stole"
227,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,near enough under a hedge to watch this sight. They hopped and pecked
228,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in a multitude beneath her hands, tits and robins, starlings and"
229,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"blackbirds, and other much wilder and rarer birds, as if they had no"
230,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"need here for wings, or were under an enchantment more powerful than"
231,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"that of mere crumbs of bread. The meal done, the platter empty, Miss"
232,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Taroone would clap her hands, and off they would fly with a skirring of"
233,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"wings, with shrill cries and snatches of song to their haunts."
234,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
235,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,She seemed to mind no weather; standing bare-headed in heavy rain or
236,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,scorching sunlight. And I confess the sight of her never failed to
237,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,alarm me. But I made up my mind always to keep my wits about me and my
238,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,eyes open; and never to be _caught_ trespassing.
239,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
240,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Then one day, as I slid down from the roof of the barn from amid the"
241,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"branches of a chestnut tree, green with its spiky balls of fruit, I"
242,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"found Miss Taroone standing there in the entry, looking out on me as if"
243,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"out of a frame, or like a stone figure in the niche of a church. She"
244,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"made no stir herself, but her eyes did. Clear cold eyes of the colour"
245,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of pebbly water, in which I seemed to be of no more importance than a"
246,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,boat floating on the sea. I could neither speak nor run away. I could
247,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"only gawk at her, my pockets bulging with the unripe chestnuts I had"
248,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"pilfered, and a handsome slit in one leg of my breeches."
249,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
250,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,She asked me what I did there; my name; why I was not at school; where
251,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I lived; and did I eat the chestnuts. It appeared she had more often
252,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,seen me--I suppose from her windows--than I had seen her. She made
253,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"no movement, never even smiled while I stammered out answers to her"
254,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"questions, but merely kept her eyes steadily fixed on me, while her own"
255,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,lips just opened enough to let the words out of her mouth. She listened
256,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"to me with a severe face, and said, ""Well, if you are happy to be here"
257,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"with the rest, so much the better."""
258,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
259,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"It was a relief when she turned away, bidding me follow her--and a"
260,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,foolish figure I must have cut as I clattered after her across the
261,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,cobbled yard under the old red-brick arch and so through the porch and
262,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,into the house.
263,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
264,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"When I was sat down in one of the shaded rooms within the house, she"
265,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,summoned the tall gaunt old maid with the cap-flaps I had seen at the
266,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"windows, and bade her bring me some fruit and a dish of cream. Miss"
267,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Taroone watched me while I ate it. And uncommonly good it was, though"
268,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I would rather have been enjoying it alone. From the way she looked at
269,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,me it might have been supposed it was a bird or a small animal that
270,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"was sitting up at her table. The last spoonful finished, she asked me"
271,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,yet more questions and appeared to be not displeased with my rambling
272,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"answers, for she invited me to come again and watched me take up my cap"
273,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and retire.
274,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
275,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,This was the first time I was ever in Miss Taroone's house--within its
276,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"solid walls I mean; and what a multitude of rooms, with their coffers"
277,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and presses and cabinets, containing I knew not what treasures and"
278,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"wonders! But Thrae was not Miss Taroone's only house, for more than"
279,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"once she spoke of another--named SURE VINE, as if of a family"
280,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"mansion and estate, very ancient and magnificent. When, thinking of my"
281,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"mother, I myself ventured a question about East Dene, her green-grey"
282,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"eyes oddly settled on mine a moment, but she made no answer. I noticed"
283,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,this particularly.
284,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
285,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Soon I was almost as free and familiar in Miss Taroone's old house as
286,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in my own father's. Yet I cannot say that she was ever anything else
287,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,than curt with me in her manner. It was a long time before I became
288,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"accustomed to the still, secret way she had of looking at me. I liked"
289,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"best being in her company when she appeared, as was usually so, not to"
290,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"be aware that she was not alone. She had again asked me my name ""for"
291,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"a sign"" as she said, ""to know you by""; though she always afterwards"
292,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"addressed me as Simon. Certainly in those days I was ""simple"" enough."
293,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
294,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,My next friend was the woman whom I had seen shaking her duster out of
295,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the upper windows. She, I discovered, was called Linnet Sara Queek"
296,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"or Quek or Cuec or Cueque, I don't know how to spell it. She was an"
297,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,exceedingly curious woman and looked as if she had never been any
298,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"different, though, of course, she must once have been young and have"
299,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"grown up. She was bony, awkward, and angular, and when you spoke to"
300,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"her, she turned on you with a look that was at the same time vacant and"
301,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"piercing. At first she greeted me sourly, but soon became friendlier,"
302,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and would allow me to sit in her huge kitchen with her parrot, her"
303,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"sleek tabby cat, and perhaps a dainty or two out of her larder."
304,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
305,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,She was continually muttering--though I could never quite catch what
306,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"she said; never idle; and though slow and awkward in her movements, she"
307,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,did a vast deal of work. With small short-sighted eyes fixed on her
308,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,mortar she would stand pounding and pounding; or stewing and seething
309,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,things in pots--strange-looking roots and fruits and fungi. Her pantry
310,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"was crammed with pans, jars, bottles, and phials, all labelled in her"
311,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,queer handwriting. An extraordinary place--especially when the sunbeams
312,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of evening struck into it from a high window in its white-washed wall.
313,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
314,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Linnet she might be called, but her voice was no bird's, unless the"
315,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"crow's; and you would have guessed at once, at sight of her standing in"
316,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"front of the vast open hearth, stooping a little, her long gaunt arms"
317,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"beside her, that her other name was Sara. But she could tell curious"
318,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and rambling stories (as true as she could make them); and many of
319,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"them were about the old days in Thrae, older days in Sure Vine, and"
320,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"about Miss Taroone, in whose service she had been since she was a small"
321,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,child.
322,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
323,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"She told me, too, some specially good tales--as good as Grimm--about"
324,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,some villages she knew of called the Ten Laps; and gave me a custard
325,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"when I asked for more. I once mentioned East Dene to her, too, and she"
326,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,said there was a short cut to it (though it seemed to me a long way
327,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"about) through the quarry, by the pits, and that way round. ""And then"
328,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"you come to a Wall,"" she said, staring at me. ""And you climb over."""
329,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
330,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Did _you_?"" said I, laughing; and at that she was huffed."
331,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
332,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Boy though I was, it occurred to me that in this immense house there"
333,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,must be a great deal more work than Sara could manage unaided.
334,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Something gave me the fancy that other hands must lend their help;
335,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"but if any maids actually came in to Thrae from East Dene, or from"
336,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"elsewhere, they must have come and gone very late, or early. It seemed"
337,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"bad manners to be too curious. On the other hand, I rarely saw much of"
338,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the back parts of the house.
339,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
340,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I have sometimes wondered if Thrae had not once in fact lain within
341,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the borders of East Dene, and that being so, if Miss Taroone, like"
342,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"myself, was unaware of it. It may have been merely pride that closed"
343,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"her lips, for one day, she showed me, with a curious smile, how Thrae's"
344,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"architect, centuries before, had planned its site. She herself led me"
345,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,from room to room; and she talked as she had never talked before.
346,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
347,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Its southernmost window looked on a valley, beyond which on clear still"
348,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"days was visible the sea, and perhaps a brig or a schooner on its"
349,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,surface--placid blue as turquoise. Sheer against its easternmost window
350,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the sun mounted to his summer solstice from in between a cleft of the
351,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,hills--like a large topaz between the forks of a catapult. On one side
352,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of this cleft valley was a windmill, its sails lanking up into the sky,"
353,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and sometimes spinning in the wind with an audible faint clatter. Who
354,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,owned the mill and what he ground I never heard.
355,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
356,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Northwards, through a round bull's-eye window you could see, past"
357,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"a maze of coppices and hills, and in the distance, the cock of a"
358,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"cathedral spire. And to the west stood a wood of yew, its pool"
359,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"partially greened over, grey with willows, and the haunt of rare birds."
360,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,On the one side of this pool spread exceedingly calm meadows; and on
361,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the other, in a hollow, the graveyard lay. The stones and bones in it"
362,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,were all apparently of Miss Taroone's kinsfolk. At least Linnet Sara
363,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,told me so. Nor was she mournful about it. She seemed to have nobody to
364,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"care for but her mistress; working for love, whatever her wages might"
365,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,be.
366,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
367,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"It is an odd thing to say, but though I usually tried to avoid meeting"
368,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Miss Taroone, and was a little afraid of her, there was a most curious"
369,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,happiness at times in being in her company. She never once asked me
370,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"about my character, never warned me of anything, never said ""You must"";"
371,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and yet I knew well that if in stupidity or carelessness I did anything
372,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in her house which she did not approve of, my punishment would come."
373,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
374,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"She once told me, ""Simon, you have, I see, the beginnings of a bad"
375,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,feverish cold. It is because you were stupid enough yesterday to
376,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,stand with the sweat on your face talking to me in a draught. It will
377,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"probably be severe."" And so it was."
378,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
379,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,She never said anything affectionate; she never lost her temper. I
380,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"never saw her show any pity or meanness or revenge. ""Well, Simon,"""
381,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"she would say, ""Good morning""; or ""Good evening"" (as the case might"
382,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"be); ""you are always welcome. Have a good look about you. Don't waste"
383,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"your time here. Even when all is said, you will not see too much of me"
384,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and mine. But don't believe _everything_ you may hear in the kitchen.
385,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Linnet Sara is a good servant, but still a groper."""
386,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
387,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Not the least notion of what she meant occurred to me. But I peacocked
388,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,about for a while as if she had paid me a compliment. An evening or two
389,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"afterwards, and soon after sunset, I found her sitting in her westward"
390,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"window. Perhaps because rain was coming, the crouching head-stones"
391,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"under the hill looked to be furlongs nearer. ""Sleeping, waking; waking,"
392,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"sleeping, Simon;"" she said, ""sing while you can."" Like a little owl I"
393,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"fixed sober eyes on the yew-wood, but again I hadn't any inkling of"
394,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,what she meant.
395,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
396,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,She would sit patiently listening to me as long as I cared to unbosom
397,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"myself to her. Her calm, severe, and yet, I think, beautiful face"
398,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,is clear in my memory. It resembles a little the figure in Albrecht
399,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Dürer's picture of a woman sitting beneath the wall of a house, with a"
400,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"hound couched beside her, an inclined ladder, the rain-bowed sea in the"
401,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"distance, and a bat--a tablet of magic numbers and a pent-housed bell"
402,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,over her head.
403,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
404,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Sometimes I would be questioned at home about my solitary wanderings,"
405,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"but I never mentioned Miss Taroone's name, and spoke of her house a"
406,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"little deceitfully, since I did not confess how much I loved being in"
407,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,it.
408,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
409,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"One evening--and it was already growing late--Miss Taroone, after"
410,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"steadily gazing into my eyes for a few moments, asked me if I liked"
411,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"pictures. I professed that I did, though I had never spent much time"
412,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in looking at the queer portraits and charts and mementoes that hung
413,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"thick and closely on her own walls. ""Well,"" she replied, ""if you like"
414,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"pictures I must first tell you about Nahum."""
415,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
416,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I could not at first make head or tail of Mr. Nahum. Even now I am
417,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,uncertain whether he was Miss Taroone's brother or her nephew or a
418,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,cousin many times removed; or whether perhaps she was really and truly
419,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Mrs. Taroone and he her only son; or she still Miss Taroone and he an
420,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,adopted one. I am not sure even whether or not she had much love for
421,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"him, though she appeared to speak of him with pride. What I do know is"
422,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"that Miss Taroone had nurtured him from his cradle, and had taught him"
423,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,all the knowledge that was not already his by right of birth.
424,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
425,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Before he was come even to be my own age, she told me, Nahum Taroone"
426,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"had loved ""exploring."" As a boy he had ranged over the countryside for"
427,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,miles around. I never dared ask her if he had sat on Linnet Sara's
428,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Wall""! He had scrawled plans and charts and maps, marking on them all"
429,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"his wanderings. And not only the roads, paths, chaces, and tracks, the"
430,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"springs and streams, but the rarer birds' nesting-places and the rarer"
431,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"wild flowers, the eatable or poisonous fruits, trees, animal lairs,"
432,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"withies for whips, clay for modelling, elder shoots for pitch pipes,"
433,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"pebbles for his catapult, flint arrows, and everything of that kind. He"
434,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"was a night-boy too; could guide himself by the stars, was a walking"
435,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"almanac of the moon; and could decoy owls and nightjars, and find any"
436,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"fox's or badger's earth he was after, even in a dense mist."
437,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
438,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I came to know Mr. Nahum pretty well--so far at any rate as one can
439,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,know anybody from hearsay--before Miss Taroone referred to the pictures
440,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"again. And I became curious about him, and hoped to see this strange"
441,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"traveller, and frequently hung about Thrae in mere chance of that."
442,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
443,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Strangely enough, by the looks on her face and the tones of her voice,"
444,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Miss Taroone was inclined to mock a little at Mr. Nahum because of
445,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,his restlessness. She didn't seem to approve of his leaving her so
446,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,much--though she herself had come from Sure Vine. Her keys would jangle
447,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"at her chatelaine as if they said, ""Ours secrets enough."" And she"
448,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"would stand listening, and mute, as if in expectation of voices or a"
449,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"footfall. Then as secretly as I could, I would get away."
450,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
451,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,All old memories resemble a dream. And so too do these of Miss Taroone
452,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and Thrae. When I was most busy and happy and engrossed in it, it"
453,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"seemed to be a house which might at any moment vanish before your eyes,"
454,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,showing itself to be but the outer shell or hiding place of an abode
455,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,still more enchanting.
456,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
457,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,This sounds nonsensical. But if you have ever sat and watched a
458,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Transformation Scene in a pantomime, did you suppose, just before"
459,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the harlequin slapped with his wand on what looked like a plain
460,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"brick-and-mortar wall, that it would instantly after dissolve"
461,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,into a radiant coloured scene of trees and fountains and hidden
462,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,beings--growing lovelier in their own showing as the splendour spread
463,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and their haunts were revealed? Well, so at times I used to feel in"
464,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,_Thrae_.
465,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
466,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"At last, one late evening in early summer, beckoning me with her"
467,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"finger, Miss Taroone lit a candle in an old brass stick and bade me"
468,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,follow her down a long narrow corridor and up a steep winding stone
469,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"staircase. ""You have heard, Simon, of Mr. Nahum's round room; now you"
470,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"shall see it."""
471,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
472,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"On the wider step at the top, before a squat oak door, she stayed,"
473,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"lifted her candle, and looked at me. ""You will remember,"" she said,"
474,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""that what I am about to admit you into is Mr. Nahum's room; not mine."
475,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"You may look at the pictures, you may examine anything that interests"
476,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"you, you may compose yourself to the view. But replace what you look"
477,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"at, have a care in your handling, do nothing out of _idle_ curiosity,"
478,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and come away when you are tired. Remember that Mr. Nahum may be
479,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,returning at any hour. He would be pleased to find you here. But hasten
480,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"away out of his room the very instant you feel you have no right, lot"
481,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"or pleasure to be in it. Hasten away, I mean, so that you may return to"
482,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"it with a better mind and courage."""
483,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
484,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"She laid two fingers on my shoulder, cast another look into my face"
485,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"under her candle, turned the key in the lock, gently thrust me beyond"
486,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the door, shut it: and left me to my own devices."
487,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
488,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"What first I noticed, being for awhile a little alarmed at this strange"
489,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"proceeding, was the evening light that poured in on the room from the"
490,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"encircling windows. Below, by walking some little distance from room"
491,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"to room, corridor to corridor, you could get (as I have said) a single"
492,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"narrow view out north, south, east or west. Here, you could stand in"
493,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the middle, and turning slowly like a top on your heels, could watch"
494,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"float by one after the other, hill and windmill, ocean, distant city,"
495,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,dark yew-wood.
496,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
497,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"The crooning of doves was audible on the roof, swallows were coursing"
498,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in the placid and rosy air, the whole world seemed to be turning softly"
499,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"out of the day's sunshine, stretching long dark shadows across hill and"
500,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"valley as if in delight to be on the verge of rest and slumber again,"
501,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,now that the heats of full summer were so near.
502,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
503,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,But I believe my first _thought_ was--What a boiling hot and glaring
504,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,place to sit in in the middle of the morning. And then I noticed that
505,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"heavy curtains hung on either side each rounded window, for shade,"
506,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"concealment and solitude. As soon, however, as my eyes were accustomed"
507,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"to the dazzle, I spent little time upon the great view, but immediately"
508,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,peered about me at what was in this curious chamber.
509,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
510,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Never have I seen in any room--and this was none so large--such a
511,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"hugger-mugger of strange objects--odd-shaped coloured shells, fragments"
512,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of quartz, thunderbolts and fossils; skins of brilliant birds;"
513,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"outlandish shoes; heads, faces, masks of stone, wood, glass, wax, and"
514,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"metal; pots, images, glass shapes, and what not; lanterns and bells;"
515,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"bits of harness and ornament and weapons. There were, besides, two"
516,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"or three ships of different rigs in glass cases, and one in a green"
517,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"bottle; peculiar tools, little machines; silent clocks, instruments"
518,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of music, skulls and bones of beasts, frowsy bunches of linen or silk"
519,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"queerly marked, and a mummied cat (I think). And partly concealed, as"
520,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I twisted my head, there, dangling in an alcove, I caught sight of a"
521,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"full-length skeleton, one hollow eye-hole concealed by a curtain looped"
522,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,to the floor from the ceiling.
523,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
524,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I just cast my glance round on all these objects without of course
525,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,seeing them one by one. The air was clear as water in the evening
526,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"light, a little dust had fallen; all was in order, though at that first"
527,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"hasty glance there seemed none. Last, but not least, there was row on"
528,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,row of painted pictures. Wherever there was space on the walls free
529,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of books, this round tower room was hung with them as close as their"
530,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"frames and nails allowed. There I stood, hearing faintly the birds,"
531,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"conscious of the pouring sunlight, the only live creature amidst this"
532,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,departed traveller's treasures and possessions.
533,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
534,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I was so much taken aback by it all, so mystified by Miss Taroone's"
535,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"ways, so cold at sight of the harmless bones above me, and felt so"
536,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"suddenly out of my familiars, that without a moment's hesitation I"
537,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"turned about, flung open the door and went helter skelter clattering"
538,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,down the stairs--out of the glare into the gloom.
539,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
540,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,There was no sign of Miss Taroone as I crossed through the house and
541,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,sneaked off hastily through the garden. And not until the barn had
542,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,shut me out from the lower windows behind me did I look back at the
543,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,upper ones of Mr. Nahum's tower. Until that moment I did not know how
544,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"frightened I had been. Yet why, or at what, I cannot even now decide."
545,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
546,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,But I soon overcame this folly. Miss Taroone made no inquiry how I had
547,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"fared on this first visit to Mr. Nahum's fortress. As I have said, she"
548,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"seldom asked questions--except with her eyes, expressions, and hands."
549,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"But some time afterwards, and after two or three spells of exploration,"
550,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I myself began to talk to her of the strange things up there.
551,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
552,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""I have looked at a good many, Miss Taroone. But the pictures! Some of"
553,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,them are of places I _believe_ I know. I wish I could be a traveller
554,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and see what the others are of. Did Mr. Nahum paint them all himself?"""
555,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
556,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Miss Taroone was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, her eyes"
557,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and face very intent, as always happened when Mr. Nahum's name was"
558,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,mentioned.
559,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
560,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""I know very little about them, Simon. When Nahum was younger he used"
561,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"to make pictures of Thrae, and of the woods and valleys hereabouts."
562,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,There are boxfulls put away. Others are pictures brought back from
563,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"foreign parts, but many of them, as I believe,"" she turned her face and"
564,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"looked into a shadowy corner of the room, ""are pictures of nothing on"
565,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"earth. He has his two worlds. Take your time. Some day you too, I dare"
566,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"say, will go off on your travels. Remember that, like Nahum, you are as"
567,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"old as the hills which neither spend nor waste time, but dwell in it"
568,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"for ages, as if it were light or sunshine. Some day perhaps Nahum will"
569,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"shake himself free of Thrae altogether. I don't _know_, myself, Simon."
570,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"This house is enough for me, and what I remember of Sure Vine, compared"
571,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"with which Thrae is but the smallest of bubbles in a large glass."""
572,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
573,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I do not profess to have understood one half of what Miss Taroone meant
574,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in these remarks. It was in English and yet in a hidden tongue.
575,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
576,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"But by this time I had grown to be bolder in her company, and pounced"
577,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"on this:--""What, please Miss Taroone, do you mean by the 'two worlds'?"
578,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Or shall I ask downstairs?"" I added the latter question because now and"
579,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,then in the past Miss Taroone had bidden me go down to Linnet Sara for
580,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,my answers. She now appeared at first not to have heard it.
581,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
582,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Now I must say to you, Simon,"" she replied at last, folding her hands"
583,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"on her knee, ""wherever you may be in that body of yours, you feel you"
584,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"look out of it, do you not?"""
585,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
586,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I nodded. ""Yes, Miss Taroone."""
587,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
588,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Now think, then, of Mr. Nahum's round room; where is that?"""
589,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
590,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Up there,"" said I, pointing up a rambling finger."
591,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
592,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Ah!"" cried Miss Taroone, ""so it may be. But even if to-morrow you are"
593,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,thousands of miles distant from here on the other side of this great
594,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Ball, or in its bowels, or flying free--you will still carry a picture"
595,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of it, will you not? And that will be within you?"""
596,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
597,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Yes, in my mind, Miss Taroone?"" I answered rather sheepishly."
598,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
599,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""In your mind,"" she echoed me, but not as if she were particularly"
600,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"pleased at the fact. ""Well, many of the pictures I take it in Mr."
601,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Nahum's round tower are of _that_ world. His MIND. I have never
602,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,examined them. My duties are elsewhere. Your duty is to keep your
603,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"senses, heart and courage and to go where you are called. And in black"
604,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"strange places you will at times lose yourself and find yourself,"
605,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Simon. Now Mr. Nahum is calling. Don't think of me too much. I have
606,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,great faith in him. Sit up there with him then. Share your eyes with
607,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"his pictures. And having seen them, compare them if you will. Say, This"
608,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"is this, and that is that. And make of all that he has exactly what use"
609,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"you can."""
610,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
611,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,With this counsel in my head I once more groped my way up the corkscrew
612,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"stone staircase, and once more passed on from picture to picture; in my"
613,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,engrossment actually knocking my head against the dangling foot-bones
614,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of Mr. Nahum's treasured and now unalarming skeleton.
615,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
616,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"The pictures were of all kinds and sizes--in water colour, in chalks,"
617,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and in oil. Some I liked for their vivid colours and deep shadows, and"
618,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,some I did not like at all. Nor could I always be sure even what they
619,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,were intended to represent. Many of them completely perplexed me. A few
620,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of them seemed to me to be absurd; some made me stupidly ashamed; and
621,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,one or two of them terrified me. But I went on examining them when I
622,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"felt inclined, and a week or so after, as I was lifting out one of them"
623,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"into the sunshine, by chance it twisted on its cord and disclosed its"
624,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,wooden back.
625,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
626,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"And there, pasted on to it, was a scrap of yellowing paper with the"
627,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"letters BLAKE, followed by a number--CXLVII, in Roman figures. As with"
628,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"this one, so with the others. Each had its name and a number."
629,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
630,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"And even as I stood pondering what this might mean, my eyes rested on"
631,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,a lower shelf of one of Mr. Nahum's cases of books--book-cases which
632,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I have forgotten to say stood all round the lower part of the room. I
633,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,had already discovered that many of these books were the writings of
634,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,travellers in every part of the globe. One whole book-case consisted of
635,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,what Mr. Nahum appeared to call Kitchen Work. But the one on a lower
636,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"shelf which had now taken my attention was new to me--an enormous,"
637,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"thick, home-made-looking volume covered in a greenish shagreen or"
638,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,shark-skin.
639,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
640,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Scrawled in ungainly capitals on the strip of vellum pasted to the back
641,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of this book was its title: THEOTHERWORLDE. Would you believe it?--at
642,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"first I was stupid enough to suppose this title was one word, a word"
643,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in a strange tongue, which I pronounced to myself as best I could,"
644,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"THEEOTHAWORLDIE--saying the TH as in _thimble_. And that is what,"
645,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"merely for old sake's sake, I have continued to call the book in my"
646,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,mind to this day!
647,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
648,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I glanced out of the window. The upper boughs of the yew-wood and the
649,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,stones this side of it among the bright green grasses were impurpled by
650,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the reflected sunlight. Nothing there but motionless shadows. I stood
651,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,looking vacantly out for a moment or two; then stooped and lugged out
652,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the ponderous fusty old volume on to the floor and raised its clumsy
653,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,cover.
654,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
655,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"To my surprise and pleasure, I found, that attached within was the"
656,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"drawing of a boy of about my own age, but dressed like a traveller,"
657,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,whose face faintly resembled a portrait I had noticed on the walls
658,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"downstairs, though this child had wings painted to his shoulders and"
659,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,there was a half circle of stars around his head. Beneath this portrait
660,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in the book, in small letters, was scrawled in a faded handwriting,"
661,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"NAHUM TARUNE. This, then, was Mr. Nahum when he was a boy. It"
662,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,pleased me to find that he was no better a speller than myself. He had
663,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,not even got his own name right! I liked his face. He looked out from
664,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"under his stars at me, full in the eyes."
665,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
666,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Next--after I had searched his looks and clothes and what he carried
667,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,pretty closely--I turned over a few of the stiff leaves and found more
668,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of his writing with a big VII scrawled on the top. On page one of this
669,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,book you will find the writing. I should have been a stupider boy even
670,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,than I was if I had not at once turned over the pictures till I came to
671,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,that with VII on the label on the back of it. This picture was of a
672,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Maze outlined in gaudy colours which faded towards the middle--a sort
673,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of oasis in which grew a tree. Fabulous-looking animals and creatures
674,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,with wings sprawled around its margins. After repeated attempts I
675,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,found to my disappointment that your only way out of the oasis and the
676,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"maze was, after long groping, by the way you went in. Underneath it"
677,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"was written ""_This is the key._"" And above it in green letters stood"
678,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,this:--Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
679,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"tidings, that publisheth peace!"
680,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
681,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,It was unfortunate that so little more of daylight was now left dying
682,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in the sky that evening; for as yet I had not the confidence to kindle
683,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the wax candles that stood in their brass sticks in the round tower.
684,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,It was high time for me to be getting home. In my haste to be off I
685,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"nearly collided with Miss Taroone, who happened to be standing in the"
686,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,dusklight looking out from under her porch. Too much excited even to
687,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"beg her pardon, I blurted out: ""Miss Taroone, I have found out what"
688,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the pictures are of. It's a Book. _Theeothaworldie._ Mr. Nahum's
689,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"portrait's in it, but they've put wings to him; and it's all in his"
690,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"writing--rhymes."""
691,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
692,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"She looked down at me, though I could not quite see her face."
693,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
694,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Then, good-night to you, Simon; and happy dreams,"" she said, in her"
695,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,unfriendly voice.
696,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
697,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""I like the round room better and better,"" I replied as heartily as I"
698,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"could. ""That picture of Mr. Nahum--and there are lots more, I think--is"
699,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"a _little_ bit like an uncle of mine who died in Russia; my Uncle John."""
700,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
701,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""John's as good a name, I suppose, as any other, Simon,"" said Miss"
702,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Taroone. She stood looking out on the dusky country scene. ""There's a"
703,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"heavy dew tonight, and the owls are busy."""
704,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
705,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,They were indeed. Their screechings sounded on all sides of me as I ran
706,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"off homewards, chanting over to myself the words that had somehow stuck"
707,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in my memory.
708,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
709,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Well, at last I began to read in Mr. Nahum's book--I won't say page"
710,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"by page, but as the fancy took me. It consisted chiefly of rhymes and"
711,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"poems, and some of them had pictured capitals and were decorated in"
712,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,clear bright colours like the pages of the old books illuminated by
713,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,monks centuries ago. Apart from the poems were here and there pieces
714,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of prose. These, I found, always had some bearing on the poems, and,"
715,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"like them, many of them were queerly spelt. Occasionally Mr. Nahum had"
716,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,jotted down his own thoughts in the margin. But the pictures were my
717,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,first concern.
718,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
719,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Sometimes I went off to them from the book in order to find the
720,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,particular one I wanted. And sometimes the other way round: I would
721,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"have a good long stare at a picture, then single out the proper rhyme"
722,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in the book. Often, either in one way or the other, I failed. For there"
723,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"were far fewer pictures than there were pages in the book, and for"
724,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,scores of pages I found no picture at all. It seemed Mr. Nahum had made
725,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,paintings only of those he liked best.
726,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
727,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"The book itself, I found, was the first of three, the other two being"
728,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,similar to itself but much thicker and heavier. Into these I dipped
729,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"occasionally, but found that the rhymes in them interested me less"
730,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,or were less easily understandable. Even some of those in the first
731,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,book were a little beyond my wits at the time. But experience seems to
732,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,be like the shining of a bright lantern. It suddenly makes clear in
733,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the mind what was already there perhaps, but dim. And often though I"
734,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"immediately liked what I read, long years were to go by before I really"
735,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"understood it, made it my own. There would come a moment, something"
736,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"would happen; and I would say to myself:--""Oh, that, then, is what"
737,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"_that_ meant!"""
738,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
739,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Before going any further I must confess that I was exceedingly slow
740,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,over Mr. Nahum's writings. Even over Volume I. When first I opened its
741,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,pages I had had a poor liking for poetry because of a sort of contempt
742,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"for it. ""Poetry!"" I would scoff to myself, and would shut up the covers"
743,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of any such book with a kind of yawn inside me. Some of it had come my
744,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"way in lesson books. This I could gabble off like a parrot, and with as"
745,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,much understanding; and I had just begun to grind out a little Latin
746,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,verse for my father.
747,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
748,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,But I had never troubled to think about it; to share my Self with it;
749,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,to examine it in order to see whether or not it was true; or to ask
750,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,why it was written in this one way and in no other way. But apart
751,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"from this, there were many old rhymes in Mr. Nahum's book--nursery"
752,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,things--which I had known since I knew anything. And I still have an
753,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,old childish love for rhymes and jingles like them.
754,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
755,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,But what about the others? I began to ponder. After being so many hours
756,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"alone in Mr. Nahum's room, among his secret belongings, I almost felt"
757,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"his presence there. When your mind is sunk in study, it is as if you"
758,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"were in a dream. But you cannot tell where, or in whose company, you"
759,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,may wake out of a dream. I remember one sultry afternoon being startled
760,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"out of my wits by a sudden clap of thunder. I looked up, to find the"
761,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"whole room black, zigzag, and strange, and for a moment I fancied Mr."
762,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Nahum was actually there behind me; and not a friendly Mr. Nahum.
763,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
764,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,That is mere fancy; though in other ways he became so real to me at
765,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,last that I would do things as if he had asked me to do them. For this
766,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"reason, I think, I persevered with his book, swallowing some of the"
767,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"poems as if they were physic, simply because he had written them there."
768,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"But the more I read, the more I came to enjoy them for their own sakes."
769,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Not all of them, of course. But I did see this, that like a carpenter"
770,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"who makes a table, a man who has written a poem has written it like"
771,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,that _on purpose_.
772,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
773,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,With this thought in my head I tried one day to alter the words of
774,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,one or two of the simple and easy poems; or to put the words in a
775,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,different order. And I found by so doing that you not only altered
776,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the sound of the poem, but that even the slightest alteration in the"
777,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,sound a little changed the sense. Either you lost something of the tune
778,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and runningness; or the words did not clash right; or you blurred the
779,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,picture the words gave you; or some half-hidden meaning vanished away.
780,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I don't mean that every poem is perfect; but only that when I changed
781,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,them it was almost always very much for the worse. I was very slow
782,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in all this; but, still, I went on. No. III, I remember, was the old"
783,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"nursery jingle, ""Old King Cole"":--"
784,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
785,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Old King Cole was a merry old soul,"
786,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,And a merry old soul was he;
787,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"He called for his pipe,"
788,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"And he called for his bowl,"
789,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,And he called for his fiddlers three....
790,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
791,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Now, suppose, instead of these four lines of the rhyme you put:--"
792,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
793,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Old King Cole was a jolly old man,"
794,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,The jolliest old man alive;
795,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"He called for his cup, and he called for a pipe"
796,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,And he called for his fiddlers five.
797,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
798,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,By so doing you have actually added two extra fiddlers; and yet somehow
799,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,you have taken away some of the old three's music. Or you may put:--
800,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
801,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"'Cole the First was now a monarch advanced in age, and of a convivial"
802,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,temperament. On any festive occasion he would bid his retainers bring
803,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"him his goblet and smoking materials, and would command his musicians"
804,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,to entertain him on their violins: which they did.'
805,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
806,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Well, all the _facts_ are there and many more words, but scarcely a"
807,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"trace of _my_ old King Cole, and not a single tweedle-eedle of the"
808,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,fiddling. Would anyone trouble to learn that by heart?
809,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
810,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Now underneath this rhyme Mr. Nahum had written a sort of historical
811,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"account of King Cole, a good deal of it in German and other languages."
812,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,All I could make out of it was this: if ever a King Cole inhabited the
813,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"world, he probably had another name; that he lived too far back in"
814,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,history for anyone to make sure when he had lived or that he had lived
815,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"at all; and that his ""pipe"" and ""bowl"" probably stand for objects much"
816,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,more mysterious and far less common.
817,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
818,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Having the rhyme quite free to myself, I didn't mind reading this; but"
819,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"if ever I have to give up either, I shall keep the rhyme."
820,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
821,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Having discovered, then, that every poem must have been written as it"
822,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"was written, on purpose, I took a little more pains with those I cared"
823,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,for least. In some even then I could not quite piece out the meaning;
824,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in others I could not easily catch the beat and rhythm and tune. But I
825,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"learned to read them very slowly, so as fully and quietly to fill up"
826,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the time allowed for each line and to listen to its music, and to see"
827,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and hear all that the words were saying.
828,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
829,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Then, too, what Miss Taroone had said came back to my mind. Even when"
830,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Mr. Nahum's poems were about real things and places and people, they"
831,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,were still only of places and people the words made for me in my
832,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"_mind_. I must, that is, myself imagine all they told. And I found that"
833,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the mention in a poem even of quite common and familiar things--such as
834,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"a star, or a buttercup, or a beetle--did not bring into the mind quite"
835,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the same kind of images of them as the things and creatures themselves
836,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,do in the naked eye.
837,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
838,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Now the day is over,"
839,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Night is drawing nigh;
840,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Shadows of the evening
841,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Steal across the sky....
842,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
843,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"This was one of the earliest poems in Mr. Nahum's book. I had often, of"
844,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"course, seen the shadows of evening--every grass-blade or pebble casts"
845,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"its own; but these words not only called them vividly into my mind, but"
846,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,set shadows there (shadows across the sky) that I had never really seen
847,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"at all--with my own eyes I mean. I discovered afterwards, also, that"
848,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"shadows are only the absence of light, though light is needed to make"
849,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"them visible. Just the same, again, with the sailors in the same poem:"
850,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
851,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Guard the sailors tossing
852,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,On the deep blue sea....
853,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
854,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"They are plain and common words, but their _order_ here is the poem's"
855,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"only, and the effect they had on me, and still have, is different from"
856,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the effect of any other words on the same subject. Though, too, like"
857,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Mr. Nahum, I have now seen something of the world (have been seasick"
858,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and nearly drowned) I have never forgotten those imaginary sailors,"
859,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,or that imaginary sea; can still hear the waves lapping against that
860,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"(unmentioned) ship's thin wooden walls, as if I myself were sleeping"
861,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"there, down below."
862,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
863,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"So what I then read has remained a clear and single remembrance, as if"
864,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I myself had seen it in a world made different, or in a kind of vision"
865,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,or dream. And I think Mr. Nahum had chosen such poems in Volume I.
866,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"as carried away the imagination like that; either into the past, or"
867,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"into another mind, or into the all-but-forgotten; at times as if into"
868,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,another world. And this kind has been my choice in this book.
869,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
870,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Not that his picture to a particular poem was always the picture I
871,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,should have made of it. Take for example another nursery jingle in his
872,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,book:
873,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
874,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,'How many miles to Babylon?'
875,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,'Three score and ten.'
876,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,'Can I get there by candle-light?'
877,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"'Ay, and back again.'"
878,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
879,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Mr. Nahum's corresponding picture was not of Babylon or of a candle, or"
880,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of a traveller at all, but of a stone tomb, On its thick upper slab he"
881,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"had drawn-in an old earthen lamp, with a serpent for handle--its wick"
882,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"alight, and shining up on a small owl perched in the lower branches of"
883,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the thick tree above.
884,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
885,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,That is one of the pleasures of reading--you may make any picture out
886,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of the words you can and will; and a poem may have as many different
887,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,meanings as there are different minds.
888,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
889,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"There I would sit, then, and Mr. Nahum's book made of ""one little room"
890,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"an everywhere."" And though I was naturally rather stupid and dense,"
891,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I did in time realise that ""rare poems ask rare friends,"" and that"
892,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,even the simplest ones may have secrets which will need a pretty close
893,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,searching out.
894,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
895,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Of course I could not copy out all of the poems even in
896,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"THEEOTHAWORLDIE, Volume I., and I took very few from Volumes"
897,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"II. and III. I chose what I liked best--those that, when I read them,"
898,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"never failed to carry me away, as if on a Magic Carpet, or in Seven"
899,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"League Boots, into a region of their own. When the nightingale sings,"
900,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"other birds, it is said, will sit and listen to him: and I remember"
901,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"very well hearing a nightingale so singing on a spray in a dewy hedge,"
902,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and there were many small birds perched mute and quiet near. The cock
903,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,crows at midnight; and for miles around his kinsmen answer. The fowler
904,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,whistles his decoy for the wild duck to come. So certain rhymes and
905,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"poems affected my mind when I was young, and continue to do so now that"
906,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,I am old.
907,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
908,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"To these (and the few bits of prose) which I chose from Mr. Nahum, I"
909,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"added others afterwards, and they are in this book too. All of them are"
910,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,in English; a few from over the ocean: but how very few they all are
911,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,by comparison with the multitudes even of their own kind. And there are
912,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the whole world's languages besides! Even of my own favourites not all
913,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,have found a place. There was not room enough. I have left out others
914,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"also that may be found easily elsewhere. I am afraid, too, there may be"
915,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"many mistakes in my copying, though I have tried to be careful."
916,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
917,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Miss Taroone knew that I was making use of Mr. Nahum's book; though she
918,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,never questioned me about it. I came and went in her house at last like
919,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"a rabbit in a warren, a mouse in a mousery. The hours I spent in those"
920,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"far-gone days in Mr. Nahum's round room! At times I wearied of it, and"
921,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"hated his books, and even wished I had never so much as set eyes on"
922,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,Thrae at all.
923,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
924,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"But after such sour moments, a gossip and an apple with Linnet Sara"
925,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in her kitchen, or a scamper home, or a bathe under the hazels in the"
926,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"stream whose source, I believe, is in the hills beyond East Dene,"
927,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,would set me to rights again. For sheer joy of return I could scarcely
928,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"breathe for a while after remounting the stone staircase, re-entering"
929,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Mr. Nahum's room, and closing the door behind me."
930,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
931,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,From above his broad scrawled pages I would lift my eyes to his windows
932,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,and stare as if out of one dream into another. How strange from across
933,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"the sky was the gentle scented breeze blowing in on my cheek, softly"
934,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,stirring the dried kingfisher skin that hung from its beam; how near
935,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,understanding then the tongues of the wild birds; how close the painted
936,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"scene--as though I were but a picture too, and this my frame."
937,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
938,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,But there came a day that was to remove me out of the neighbourhood
939,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,of Miss Taroone's Thrae into a different kind of living altogether. I
940,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"was to be sent to school. After a hot debate with myself, and why I"
941,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"scarcely know, I asked my father's permission to spend the night at"
942,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Miss Taroone's. He gave me a steady look and said, Yes."
943,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
944,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I found Miss Taroone seated on the steps of her porch, and now that I"
945,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"look back at her then, she curiously reminds me--though she was ages"
946,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,older--of a picture you will find in the second stanza of poem No.
947,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,233 in this book. Standing before her--it was already getting towards
948,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,dark--I said I was come to bid her goodbye; and might I spend the night
949,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"in Mr. Nahum's round room. She raised her eyes on me, luminous and"
950,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"mysterious as the sky itself, even though in the dusk."
951,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
952,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""You may _say_, goodbye, Simon,"" she replied; ""but unless I myself am"
953,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"much mistaken in you, your feet will not carry you out of all thought"
954,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of me; and some day they will return to me whether you will or not."""
955,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
956,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Inside I was already in a flutter at thought of the hours to come, and"
957,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I was accustomed to her strange speeches, though this struck on my mind"
958,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"more coldly than usual. I made a little jerk forwards; ""I must thank"
959,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"you, please Miss Taroone, for having been so kind to me,"" I gulped in"
960,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"an awkward voice. ""And I hope,"" I added, as she made no answer, ""I hope"
961,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I haven't been much of a bother--coming like this, I mean?"""
962,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
963,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""None, Simon;"" was her sole reply. The hand that I had begun to hold"
964,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"out, went back into my pocket, and feeling extremely uncomfortable I"
965,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,half turned away.
966,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
967,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Why, who knows?--"" said the solemn voice, ""Mr. Nahum may at this very"
968,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"moment be riding home. Have a candle alight."""
969,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
970,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"""Thank you, Miss Taroone. Thank you very much indeed."""
971,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
972,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,With that I turned about and hastened across the darkening garden into
973,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the house. My candlestick and matches stood ready on the old oak bench
974,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"at the foot of the tower. I lit up, and began to climb the cold steps."
975,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"My heart in my mouth, I hesitated at the hob-nailed door; but managed"
976,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,at last to turn the key in the lock.
977,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
978,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"With two taller candles kindled, and its curtains drawn over the"
979,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"western window, I at once began to copy out the last few things I"
980,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,wanted for mine in Volume I. But there were two minds in me as midnight
981,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"drew on, almost two selves, the one busy with pen and ink, the other"
982,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"stealthily listening to every faintest sound in my eyrie, a swift"
983,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,glance now and then up at the darkened glass only setting me more
984,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,sharply to work. I had never before sat in so enormous a silence; the
985,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,scratching of my pen its only tongue.
986,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
987,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"Steadily burned my candles; no sound of hoofs, no owl-cry, no knocking"
988,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,disturbed my peace; the nightingales had long since journeyed South.
989,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"What I had hoped for, expected, dreaded in this long vigil, I cannot"
990,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,recall; all that I remember of it is that I began to shiver a little at
991,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"last, partly because my young nerves were on the stretch, and partly"
992,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,because the small hours grew chill. In the very middle of the night
993,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,there came to my ear what seemed a distant talking or gabbling. It
994,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,may have been fancy; it may have been Linnet Sara. What certainly was
995,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"fancy is the notion that, as I started up out of an instant's drowse,"
996,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,a stooping shape had swiftly withdrawn itself from me. But this was
997,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,merely the shadow of a dream.
998,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
999,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"I returned at last from the heavy sleep I had fallen into, my forehead"
1000,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"resting on the backs of my hands, and they flat on the huge open"
1001,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"volume, my whole body stiff with cold, and the first clear grey of"
1002,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"daybreak in the East. And suddenly, as my awakened eyes stared dully"
1003,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"about them in that thin light--the old windows, the strange outlandish"
1004,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"objects, the clustering pictures, the countless books, my own ugly"
1005,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,writing on my paper--an indescribable despair and anxiety--almost
1006,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,terror even--seized upon me at the rushing thought of my own
1007,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"_ignorance_; of how little I knew, of how unimportant I was. And, again"
1008,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"and again, my ignorance. Then I thought of Miss Taroone, of Mr. Nahum,"
1009,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of the life before me, and everything yet to do. And a sullen misery"
1010,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,swept up in me at these reflections. And once more I wished from the
1011,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,bottom of my heart that I had never come to this house.
1012,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
1013,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"But gradually the light broadened. And with it, confidence began to"
1014,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,return. The things around me that had seemed strange and hostile became
1015,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"familiar again. I stood up and stretched myself and, I think, muttered"
1016,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,a prayer.
1017,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
1018,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,To this day I see the marvellous countryside of that morning with
1019,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,its hills and low thick mists and woodlands stretched like a painted
1020,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,scene beneath the windows--and that finger of light from the risen Sun
1021,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"presently piercing across the dark air, and as if by a miracle causing"
1022,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,birds and water to awake and sing and shine.
1023,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
1024,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"With a kind of grief that was yet rapture in my mind, I stood looking"
1025,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,out over the cold lichen-crusted shingled roof of Thrae--towards
1026,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the East and towards those far horizons. Yet again the apprehension
1027,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,(that was almost a hope) drew over me that at any moment wall and
1028,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"chimney-shaft might thin softly away, and the Transformation Scene"
1029,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"begin. I was but just awake: and so too was the world itself, and ever"
1030,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,is. And somewhere--Wall or no Wall--was my mother's East Dene....
1031,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
1032,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"In a while I crept softly downstairs, let myself out, and ran off into"
1033,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,the morning. Having climbed the hill from which I had first stared down
1034,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"upon Thrae, I stopped for a moment to recover my breath, and looked"
1035,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,back. I looked back.
1036,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,
1037,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,The gilding sun-rays beat low upon the house in the valley. All was
1038,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"still, wondrous, calm. For a moment my heart misgave me at this"
1039,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"farewell. The next, in sheer excitement--the cold sweet air, the"
1040,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"height, the morning, a few keen beckoning stars--I broke into a kind"
1041,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of Indian war-dance in the thin dewy grass, and then, with a last wave"
1042,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,"of my hand, like Mr. Nahum himself, I set off at a sharp walk on the"
1043,THE STORY OF THIS BOOK,journey that has not yet come to an end.

2054,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"The sheets were frozen hard, and they cut the naked hand;"
2055,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"The decks were like a slide, where a seaman scarce could stand;"
2056,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"The wind was a nor'wester, blowing squally off the sea;"
2057,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,And cliffs and spouting breakers were the only things a-lee.
2058,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,
2059,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,They heard the surf a-roaring before the break of day;
2060,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,But 'twas only with the peep of light we saw how ill we lay.
2061,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"We tumbled every hand on deck instanter, with a shout,"
2062,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"And we gave her the maintops'l, and stood by to go about."

2067,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,For very life and nature we tacked from head to head.

2072,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"And the coastguard in his garden, with his glass against his eye."

2086,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"And well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves,"
2087,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,Go dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the shelves.
2088,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,
2089,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"And well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me,"
2090,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,Of the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea;
2091,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"And O the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way,"
2092,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,To be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessèd Christmas Day.
2093,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,
2094,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"They lit the high sea-light, and the dark began to fall."
2095,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"""All hands to loose topgallant sails,"" I heard the captain call,"
2096,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"""By the Lord, she'll never stand it,"" our first mate, Jackson, cried."
2097,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"... ""It's the one way or the other, Mr. Jackson,"" he replied."
2098,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,
2099,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"She staggered to her bearings, but the sails were new and good."
2100,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,And the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood.
2101,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"As the winter's day was ending, in the entry of the night,"
2102,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"We cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light."
2103,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,
2104,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"And they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board but me,"
2105,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,As they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea;
2106,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,"But all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold,"
2107,36                   CHRISTMAS AT SEA,Was just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.

2780,53                   THE POPLAR FIELD,And the whispering sound of the cool colonnade;

2795,53                   THE POPLAR FIELD,And I must ere long lie as lowly as they
2796,53                   THE POPLAR FIELD,"With a turf on my breast, and a stone at my head,"
2797,53                   THE POPLAR FIELD,Ere another such grove shall arise in its stead.

5515,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,But they dare not look to see the cause:

5517,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies
5518,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze;
5519,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes
5520,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,"Or their limbs from the cold ground raise,"
5521,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,
5522,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,"Till out of Night the Earth has rolled her dewy side,"

5524,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,"When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning-tide,"
5525,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,The maidens' trance dissolveth so.
5526,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,
5527,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,"Then fly the ghastly three as swiftly as they may,"
5528,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,And tell their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain--
5529,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,"They pined away and died within the year and day,"
5530,135                   THE FAIRY THORN,And ne'er was Anna Grace seen again.

11636,318                   THE WATER LADY,With many a ring.

11640,318                   THE WATER LADY,"I throw my flowers from the shore,"
11641,318                   THE WATER LADY,And watch in vain.

11761,(A FAIRY TALE),"True above ills, and frailty, and all fear--"
11762,(A FAIRY TALE),Perchance a shadow of his own career

11778,(A FAIRY TALE),"From whence he shot fierce light against the stars,"

11785,(A FAIRY TALE),"The curtain-lids were plucked from his large eyes,"
11786,(A FAIRY TALE),"So he might never drowse, but watch his secret prize."

11813,(A FAIRY TALE),"Nerved to his loyal death, he may not win"

11827,(A FAIRY TALE),
11828,(A FAIRY TALE),And bright and silvery the willows sleep
11829,(A FAIRY TALE),Over the shady verge--no mad winds tease
11830,(A FAIRY TALE),Their hoary heads; but quietly they weep
11831,(A FAIRY TALE),Their sprinkling leaves--half fountains and half trees:
11832,(A FAIRY TALE),"There lilies be--and fairer than all these,"
11833,(A FAIRY TALE),A solitary Swan her breast of snow
11834,(A FAIRY TALE),Launches against the wave that seems to freeze
11835,(A FAIRY TALE),"Into a chaste reflection, still below,"
11836,(A FAIRY TALE),Twin-shadow of herself wherever she may go.
11837,(A FAIRY TALE),
11838,(A FAIRY TALE),And forth she paddles in the very noon
11839,(A FAIRY TALE),"Of solemn midnight, like an elfin thing"
11840,(A FAIRY TALE),Charmed into being by the argent moon--
11841,(A FAIRY TALE),Whose silver light for love of her fair wing
11842,(A FAIRY TALE),"Goes with her in the shade, still worshipping"
11843,(A FAIRY TALE),Her dainty plumage:--all around her grew
11844,(A FAIRY TALE),"A radiant circlet, like a fairy ring;"
11845,(A FAIRY TALE),"And all behind, a tiny little clue"
11846,(A FAIRY TALE),"Of light, to guide her back across the waters blue."
11847,(A FAIRY TALE),
11848,(A FAIRY TALE),And sure she is no meaner than a fay
11849,(A FAIRY TALE),"Redeemed from sleepy death, for beauty's sake,"
11850,(A FAIRY TALE),"By old ordainment:--silent as she lay,"
11851,(A FAIRY TALE),"Touched by a moonlight wand I saw her wake,"
11852,(A FAIRY TALE),And cut her leafy slough and so forsake
11853,(A FAIRY TALE),"The verdant prison of her lily peers,"
11854,(A FAIRY TALE),That slept amidst the stars upon the lake--
11855,(A FAIRY TALE),"A breathing shape--restored to human fears,"
11856,(A FAIRY TALE),And new-born love and grief--self-conscious of her tears.
11857,(A FAIRY TALE),
11858,(A FAIRY TALE),"And now she clasps her wings around her heart,"
11859,(A FAIRY TALE),"And near that lonely isle begins to glide,"
11860,(A FAIRY TALE),"Pale as her fears, and oft-times with a start"
11861,(A FAIRY TALE),Turns her impatient head from side to side
11862,(A FAIRY TALE),In universal terrors--all too wide
11863,(A FAIRY TALE),To watch; and often to that marble keep
11864,(A FAIRY TALE),"Upturns her pearly eyes, as if she spied"
11865,(A FAIRY TALE),"Some foe, and crouches in the shadows steep"
11866,(A FAIRY TALE),That in the gloomy wave go diving fathoms deep.
11867,(A FAIRY TALE),
11868,(A FAIRY TALE),"And well she may, to spy that fearful thing"
11869,(A FAIRY TALE),All down the dusky walls in circlets wound;
11870,(A FAIRY TALE),"Alas! for what rare prize, with many a ring"
11871,(A FAIRY TALE),Girding the marble casket round and round?
11872,(A FAIRY TALE),"His folded tail, lost in the gloom profound,"
11873,(A FAIRY TALE),Terribly darkeneth the rocky base;
11874,(A FAIRY TALE),But on the top his monstrous head is crowned
11875,(A FAIRY TALE),"With prickly spears, and on his doubtful face"
11876,(A FAIRY TALE),"Gleam his unwearied eyes, red watchers of the place."
11877,(A FAIRY TALE),
11878,(A FAIRY TALE),"Alas! of the hot fires that nightly fall,"
11879,(A FAIRY TALE),"No one will scorch him in those orbs of spite,"
11880,(A FAIRY TALE),So he may never see beneath the wall
11881,(A FAIRY TALE),"That timid little creature, all too bright,"
11882,(A FAIRY TALE),"That stretches her fair neck, slender and white,"
11883,(A FAIRY TALE),"Invoking the pale moon, and vainly tries"
11884,(A FAIRY TALE),"Her throbbing throat, as if to charm the night"
11885,(A FAIRY TALE),"With song--but, hush--it perishes in sighs,"
11886,(A FAIRY TALE),"And there will be no dirge sad-swelling, though she dies!"
11887,(A FAIRY TALE),
11888,(A FAIRY TALE),"She droops--she sinks--she leans upon the lake,"
11889,(A FAIRY TALE),Fainting again into a lifeless flower;
11890,(A FAIRY TALE),But soon the chilly springs anoint and wake
11891,(A FAIRY TALE),"Her spirit from its death, and with new power"
11892,(A FAIRY TALE),She sheds her stifled sorrows in a shower
11893,(A FAIRY TALE),"Of tender song, timed to her falling tears--"
11894,(A FAIRY TALE),"That wins the shady summit of that tower,"
11895,(A FAIRY TALE),"And, trembling all the sweeter for its fears,"
11896,(A FAIRY TALE),Fills with imploring moan that cruel monster's ears.
11897,(A FAIRY TALE),
11898,(A FAIRY TALE),"And, lo! the scaly beast is all deprest,"
11899,(A FAIRY TALE),Subdued like Argus by the might of sound--
11900,(A FAIRY TALE),What time Apollo his sweet lute addrest
11901,(A FAIRY TALE),"To magic converse with the air, and bound"
11902,(A FAIRY TALE),"The many monster eyes, all slumber-drowned:--"
11903,(A FAIRY TALE),So on the turret-top that watchful Snake
11904,(A FAIRY TALE),"Pillows his giant head, and lists profound,"
11905,(A FAIRY TALE),"As if his wrathful spite would never wake,"
11906,(A FAIRY TALE),Charmed into sudden sleep for Love and Beauty's sake!
11907,(A FAIRY TALE),
11908,(A FAIRY TALE),"His prickly crest lies prone upon his crown,"
11909,(A FAIRY TALE),"And thirsty lip from lip disparted flies,"
11910,(A FAIRY TALE),To drink that dainty flood of music down--
11911,(A FAIRY TALE),His scaly throat is big with pent-up sighs--
11912,(A FAIRY TALE),"And whilst his hollow ear entrancèd lies,"
11913,(A FAIRY TALE),His looks for envy of the charmèd sense
11914,(A FAIRY TALE),"Are fain to listen, till his steadfast eyes,"
11915,(A FAIRY TALE),"Stung into pain by their own impotence,"
11916,(A FAIRY TALE),Distil enormous tears into the lake immense.
11917,(A FAIRY TALE),
11918,(A FAIRY TALE),"Oh, tuneful Swan! oh, melancholy bird!"
11919,(A FAIRY TALE),"Sweet was that midnight miracle of song,"
11920,(A FAIRY TALE),"Rich with ripe sorrow, needful of no word"
11921,(A FAIRY TALE),"To tell of pain, and love, and love's deep wrong--"
11922,(A FAIRY TALE),Hinting a piteous tale--perchance how long
11923,(A FAIRY TALE),"Thy unknown tears were mingled with the lake,"
11924,(A FAIRY TALE),What time disguised thy leafy mates among--
11925,(A FAIRY TALE),And no eye knew what human love and ache
11926,(A FAIRY TALE),"Dwelt in those dewy leaves, and heart so nigh to break."
11927,(A FAIRY TALE),
11928,(A FAIRY TALE),Therefore no poet will ungently touch
11929,(A FAIRY TALE),"The water-lily, on whose eyelids dew"
11930,(A FAIRY TALE),Trembles like tears; but ever hold it such
11931,(A FAIRY TALE),"As human pain may wander through and through,"
11932,(A FAIRY TALE),Turning the pale leaf paler in its hue--
11933,(A FAIRY TALE),"Wherein life dwells, transfigured, not entombed,"
11934,(A FAIRY TALE),By magic spells. Alas! who ever knew
11935,(A FAIRY TALE),"Sorrow in all its shades, leafy and plumed,"
11936,(A FAIRY TALE),Or in gross husks of brutes eternally inhumed?
11937,(A FAIRY TALE),
11938,(A FAIRY TALE),And now the wingèd song has scaled the height
11939,(A FAIRY TALE),"Of that dark dwelling, builded for despair,"
11940,(A FAIRY TALE),And soon a little casement flashing bright
11941,(A FAIRY TALE),Widens self-opened into the cool air--
11942,(A FAIRY TALE),That music like a bird may enter there
11943,(A FAIRY TALE),And soothe the captive in his stony cage;
11944,(A FAIRY TALE),"For there is nought of grief, or painful care,"
11945,(A FAIRY TALE),But plaintive song may happily engage
11946,(A FAIRY TALE),"From sense of its own ill, and tenderly assuage."
11947,(A FAIRY TALE),
11948,(A FAIRY TALE),"And forth into the light, small and remote,"
11949,(A FAIRY TALE),"A creature, like the fair son of a king,"
11950,(A FAIRY TALE),Draws to the lattice in his jewelled coat
11951,(A FAIRY TALE),"Against the silver moonlight glistening,"
11952,(A FAIRY TALE),And leans upon his white hand listening
11953,(A FAIRY TALE),To that sweet music that with tenderer tone
11954,(A FAIRY TALE),"Salutes him, wondering what kindly thing"
11955,(A FAIRY TALE),"Is come to soothe him with so tuneful moan,"
11956,(A FAIRY TALE),Singing beneath the walls as if for him alone!
11957,(A FAIRY TALE),
11958,(A FAIRY TALE),"And while he listens, the mysterious song,"
11959,(A FAIRY TALE),"Woven with timid particles of speech,"
11960,(A FAIRY TALE),Twines into passionate words that grieve along
11961,(A FAIRY TALE),"The melancholy notes, and softly teach"
11962,(A FAIRY TALE),"The secrets of true love,--that trembling reach"
11963,(A FAIRY TALE),"His earnest ear, and through the shadows dun"
11964,(A FAIRY TALE),"He missions like replies, and each to each"
11965,(A FAIRY TALE),"Their silver voices mingle into one,"
11966,(A FAIRY TALE),Like blended streams that make one music as they run.
11967,(A FAIRY TALE),
11968,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Ah, Love! my hope is swooning in my heart,--"""
11969,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Ay, sweet! my cage is strong and hung full high--"""
11970,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Alas! our lips are held so far apart,"
11971,(A FAIRY TALE),"Thy words come faint,--they have so far to fly!--"""
11972,(A FAIRY TALE),"""If I may only shun that serpent-eye!--"""
11973,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Ah me! that serpent-eye doth never sleep;--"""
11974,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Then nearer thee, Love's martyr, I will die!--"""
11975,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Alas, alas! that word has made me weep!"
11976,(A FAIRY TALE),"For pity's sake remain safe in thy marble keep!"""
11977,(A FAIRY TALE),
11978,(A FAIRY TALE),"""My marble keep! it is my marble tomb--"""
11979,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Nay, sweet! but thou hast there thy living breath--"""
11980,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Aye to expend in sighs for this hard doom;--"""
11981,(A FAIRY TALE),"""But I will come to thee and sing beneath,"
11982,(A FAIRY TALE),"And nightly so beguile this serpent wreath;--"""
11983,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Nay, I will find a path from these despairs."""
11984,(A FAIRY TALE),"""Ah! needs then thou must tread the back of death,"
11985,(A FAIRY TALE),Making his stony ribs thy stony stairs.--
11986,(A FAIRY TALE),"Behold his ruby eye, how fearfully it glares!"""
11987,(A FAIRY TALE),
11988,(A FAIRY TALE),"Full sudden at these words, the princely youth"
11989,(A FAIRY TALE),"Leaps on the scaly back that slumbers, still"
11990,(A FAIRY TALE),"Unconscious of his foot, yet not for ruth,"
11991,(A FAIRY TALE),But numbed to dulness by the fairy skill
11992,(A FAIRY TALE),Of that sweet music (all more wild and shrill
11993,(A FAIRY TALE),For intense fear) that charmed him as he lay--
11994,(A FAIRY TALE),"Meanwhile the lover nerves his desperate will,"
11995,(A FAIRY TALE),"Held some short throbs by natural dismay,"
11996,(A FAIRY TALE),Then down the serpent-track begins his darksome way.
11997,(A FAIRY TALE),
11998,(A FAIRY TALE),"Now dimly seen--now toiling out of sight,"
11999,(A FAIRY TALE),Eclipsed and covered by the envious wall;
12000,(A FAIRY TALE),"Now fair and spangled in the sudden light,"
12001,(A FAIRY TALE),And clinging with wide arms for fear of fall:
12002,(A FAIRY TALE),Now dark and sheltered by a kindly pall
12003,(A FAIRY TALE),Of dusky shadow from his wakeful foe;
12004,(A FAIRY TALE),"Slowly he winds adown--dimly and small,"
12005,(A FAIRY TALE),"Watched by the gentle Swan that sings below,"
12006,(A FAIRY TALE),"Her hope increasing, still, the larger he doth grow."
12007,(A FAIRY TALE),
12008,(A FAIRY TALE),But nine times nine the Serpent folds embrace
12009,(A FAIRY TALE),The marble walls about--which he must tread
12010,(A FAIRY TALE),Before his anxious foot may touch the base:
12011,(A FAIRY TALE),"Long is the dreary path, and must be sped!"
12012,(A FAIRY TALE),"But Love, that holds the mastery of dread,"
12013,(A FAIRY TALE),"Braces his spirit, and with constant toil"
12014,(A FAIRY TALE),"He wins his way, and now, with arms outspread,"
12015,(A FAIRY TALE),Impatient plunges from the last long coil:
12016,(A FAIRY TALE),So may all gentle Love ungentle Malice foil!
12017,(A FAIRY TALE),
12018,(A FAIRY TALE),"The song is hushed, the charm is all complete,"
12019,(A FAIRY TALE),And two fair Swans are swimming on the lake:
12020,(A FAIRY TALE),"But scarce their tender bills have time to meet,"
12021,(A FAIRY TALE),When fiercely drops adown that cruel Snake--
12022,(A FAIRY TALE),"His steely scales a fearful rustling make,"
12023,(A FAIRY TALE),Like autumn leaves that tremble and foretell
12024,(A FAIRY TALE),The sable storm;--the plumy lovers quake--
12025,(A FAIRY TALE),"And feel the troubled waters pant and swell,"
12026,(A FAIRY TALE),Heaved by the giant bulk of their pursuer fell.
12027,(A FAIRY TALE),
12028,(A FAIRY TALE),"His jaws, wide yawning like the gates of Death,"
12029,(A FAIRY TALE),His horrible pursuit--his red eyes glare
12030,(A FAIRY TALE),The waters into blood--his eager breath
12031,(A FAIRY TALE),"Grows hot upon their plumes:--now, minstrel fair!"
12032,(A FAIRY TALE),"She drops her ring into the waves, and there"
12033,(A FAIRY TALE),"It widens all around, a fairy ring"
12034,(A FAIRY TALE),Wrought of the silver light--the fearful pair
12035,(A FAIRY TALE),"Swim in the very midst, and pant and cling"
12036,(A FAIRY TALE),"The closer for their fears, and tremble wing to wing."
12037,(A FAIRY TALE),
12038,(A FAIRY TALE),"Bending their course over the pale grey lake,"
12039,(A FAIRY TALE),"Against the pallid East, wherein light played"
12040,(A FAIRY TALE),"In tender flushes, still the baffled Snake"
12041,(A FAIRY TALE),"Circled them round continually, and bayed"
12042,(A FAIRY TALE),"Hoarsely and loud, forbidden to invade"
12043,(A FAIRY TALE),The sanctuary ring: his sable mail
12044,(A FAIRY TALE),"Rolled darkly through the flood, and writhed and made"
12045,(A FAIRY TALE),"A shining track over the waters pale,"
12046,(A FAIRY TALE),Lashed into boiling foam by his enormous tail.
12047,(A FAIRY TALE),
12048,(A FAIRY TALE),"And so they sailed into the distance dim,"
12049,(A FAIRY TALE),"Into the very distance--small and white,"
12050,(A FAIRY TALE),Like snowy blossoms of the spring that swim
12051,(A FAIRY TALE),Over the brooklets--followed by the spite
12052,(A FAIRY TALE),"Of that huge Serpent, that with wild affright"
12053,(A FAIRY TALE),"Worried them on their course, and sore annoy,"
12054,(A FAIRY TALE),"Till on the grassy marge I saw them 'light,"
12055,(A FAIRY TALE),"And change, anon, a gentle girl and boy,"
12056,(A FAIRY TALE),Locked in embrace of sweet unutterable joy!
12057,(A FAIRY TALE),
12058,(A FAIRY TALE),"Then came the Morn, and with her pearly showers"
12059,(A FAIRY TALE),"Wept on them, like a mother, in whose eyes"
12060,(A FAIRY TALE),Tears are no grief; and from his rosy bowers
12061,(A FAIRY TALE),"The Oriental sun began to rise,"
12062,(A FAIRY TALE),Chasing the darksome shadows from the skies;
12063,(A FAIRY TALE),Wherewith that sable Serpent far away
12064,(A FAIRY TALE),"Fled, like a part of night--delicious sighs"
12065,(A FAIRY TALE),"From waking blossoms purified the day,"
12066,(A FAIRY TALE),And little birds were singing sweetly from each spray.

12233,326                   THE CHANGELING,"The patter of the squirrel's feet,"
12234,326                   THE CHANGELING,"The pebbles pushing in the silver streams,"
12235,326                   THE CHANGELING,"The rushes talking in their dreams,"
12236,326                   THE CHANGELING,"The swish-swish of the bat's black wings,"
12237,326                   THE CHANGELING,"The wild-wood bluebell's sweet ting-tings,"

12242,326                   THE CHANGELING,"That's why I wanted to be quiet,"
12243,326                   THE CHANGELING,"Couldn't do my sums, or sing,"
12244,326                   THE CHANGELING,Or settle down to anything.
12245,326                   THE CHANGELING,"And when, for that, I was sent upstairs"
12246,326                   THE CHANGELING,I _did_ kneel down to say my prayers;
12247,326                   THE CHANGELING,But the King who sits on your high church steeple
12248,326                   THE CHANGELING,Has nothing to do with us fairy people!

12252,326                   THE CHANGELING,And dearly I loved the little pale brother
12253,326                   THE CHANGELING,Whom some other bird must have called away.
12254,326                   THE CHANGELING,Why did they bring me here to make me
12255,326                   THE CHANGELING,"Not quite bad and not quite good,"
12256,326                   THE CHANGELING,"Why, unless They're wicked, do They want, in spite, to take me"
12257,326                   THE CHANGELING,"Back to Their wet, wild wood?"
12258,326                   THE CHANGELING,"Now, every night I shall see the windows shining,"
12259,326                   THE CHANGELING,"The gold lamp's glow, and the fire's red gleam,"
12260,326                   THE CHANGELING,While the best of us are twining twigs and the rest of us are whining
12261,326                   THE CHANGELING,In the hollow by the stream.
12262,326                   THE CHANGELING,Black and chill are Their nights on the wold;
12263,326                   THE CHANGELING,And They live so long and They feel no pain:

12265,326                   THE CHANGELING,"I shall always, always be very cold,"

12280,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,And dreamed of the long dim hair

12290,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,"And Bridget his bride among them,"

12310,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,Until one bore Bridget his bride
12311,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,Away from the merry dance.
12312,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,

12315,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,And his neck and his breast and his arms
12316,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,Were drowned in her long dim hair.

12321,327                 THE HOST OF THE AIR,Were gone like a drifting smoke;

15154,PART II,"Water, water, every where,"

15157,PART II,Nor any drop to drink.
15158,PART II,
15159,PART II,The very deep did rot: O Christ!
15160,PART II,That ever this should be!

15168,PART II,
15169,PART II,And some in dreams assurèd were
15170,PART II,Of the Spirit that plagued us so;
15171,PART II,Nine fathom deep he had followed us
15172,PART II,From the land of mist and snow.
15173,PART II,
15174,PART II,"And every tongue, through utter drought,"
15175,PART II,Was withered at the root;

15190,PART III,"How glazed each weary eye,"

15193,PART III,
15194,PART III,"At first it seemed a little speck,"
15195,PART III,And then it seemed a mist;
15196,PART III,"It moved and moved, and took at last"
15197,PART III,"A certain shape, I wist."
15198,PART III,
15199,PART III,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!"
15200,PART III,And still it neared and neared:
15201,PART III,"As if it dodged a water-sprite,"
15202,PART III,It plunged and tacked and veered.
15203,PART III,
15204,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
15205,PART III,We could nor laugh nor wail;
15206,PART III,Through utter drought all dumb we stood!

15210,PART III,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,"
15211,PART III,Agape they heard me call:
15212,PART III,"Gramercy! they for joy did grin,"

15214,PART III,As they were drinking all.
15215,PART III,
15216,PART III,See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more!
15217,PART III,Hither to work us weal;

15223,PART III,Almost upon the western wave
15224,PART III,Rested the broad bright Sun;
15225,PART III,When that strange shape drove suddenly
15226,PART III,Betwixt us and the Sun.
15227,PART III,
15228,PART III,"And straight the Sun was flecked with bars,"
15229,PART III,(Heaven's Mother send us grace!)
15230,PART III,As if through a dungeon-grate he peered
15231,PART III,With broad and burning face.
15232,PART III,
15233,PART III,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
15234,PART III,How fast she nears and nears!
15235,PART III,"Are those _her_ sails that glance in the Sun,"
15236,PART III,Like restless gossameres?
15237,PART III,
15238,PART III,Are those _her_ ribs through which the Sun
15239,PART III,"Did peer, as through a grate?"
15240,PART III,And is that Woman all her crew?
15241,PART III,Is that a DEATH? and are there two?
15242,PART III,Is DEATH that woman's mate?
15243,PART III,
15244,PART III,"_Her_ lips were red, _her_ looks were free,"
15245,PART III,Her locks were yellow as gold:
15246,PART III,"Her skin was as white as leprosy,"
15247,PART III,"The Night-mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she,"
15248,PART III,Who thicks man's blood with cold.
15249,PART III,
15250,PART III,"The naked hulk alongside came,"
15251,PART III,And the twain were casting dice;
15252,PART III,"""The game is done! I've won! I've won!"""
15253,PART III,"Quoth she, and whistles thrice."
15254,PART III,
15255,PART III,The Sun's rim dips: the stars rush out:
15256,PART III,At one stride comes the dark;
15257,PART III,"With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea,"
15258,PART III,Off shot the spectre-bark.
15259,PART III,
15260,PART III,We listened and looked sideways up!
15261,PART III,"Fear at my heart, as at a cup,"
15262,PART III,My life-blood seemed to sip!
15263,PART III,"The stars were dim, and thick the night,"
15264,PART III,The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white;
15265,PART III,From the sails the dew did drip--
15266,PART III,Till clomb above the eastern bar
15267,PART III,"The hornèd Moon, with one bright star"
15268,PART III,Within the nether tip.
15269,PART III,
15270,PART III,"One after one, by the star-dogged Moon,"
15271,PART III,"Too quick for groan or sigh,"
15272,PART III,"Each turned his face with a ghastly pang,"
15273,PART III,And cursed me with his eye.
15274,PART III,
15275,PART III,"Four times fifty living men,"
15276,PART III,(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)
15277,PART III,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,"
15278,PART III,They dropped down one by one.
15279,PART III,
15280,PART III,"The souls did from their bodies fly,--"
15281,PART III,They fled to bliss or woe!
15282,PART III,"And every soul, it passed me by,"
15283,PART III,"Like the whizz of my cross-bow!"""
15284,PART III,
15285,PART III,
15286,PART IV,PART IV
15287,PART IV,
15288,PART IV,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"
15289,PART IV,I fear thy skinny hand!
15290,PART IV,"And thou art long, and lank, and brown,"
15291,PART IV,As is the ribbed sea-sand.
15292,PART IV,
15293,PART IV,"I fear thee and thy glittering eye,"
15294,PART IV,"And thy skinny hand, so brown.""--"
15295,PART IV,"""Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest!"
15296,PART IV,This body dropt not down.
15297,PART IV,
15298,PART IV,"Alone, alone, all, all alone,"
15299,PART IV,Alone on a wide wide sea!
15300,PART IV,And never a saint took pity on
15301,PART IV,My soul in agony.
15302,PART IV,
15303,PART IV,"The many men, so beautiful!"
15304,PART IV,And they all dead did lie:
15305,PART IV,And a thousand thousand slimy things
15306,PART IV,Lived on; and so did I.
15307,PART IV,
15308,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting sea,"
15309,PART IV,And drew my eyes away;
15310,PART IV,"I looked upon the rotting deck,"
15311,PART IV,And there the dead men lay.
15312,PART IV,
15313,PART IV,"I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;"
15314,PART IV,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
15315,PART IV,"A wicked whisper came, and made"
15316,PART IV,My heart as dry as dust.
15317,PART IV,
15318,PART IV,"I closed my lids, and kept them close,"
15319,PART IV,And the balls like pulses beat;
15320,PART IV,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky"
15321,PART IV,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
15322,PART IV,And the dead were at my feet.
15323,PART IV,
15324,PART IV,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,"
15325,PART IV,Nor rot nor reek did they:
15326,PART IV,The look with which they looked on me
15327,PART IV,Had never passed away.
15328,PART IV,
15329,PART IV,An orphan's curse would drag to hell
15330,PART IV,A spirit from on high;
15331,PART IV,But oh! more horrible than that
15332,PART IV,Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
15333,PART IV,"Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,"
15334,PART IV,And yet I could not die.
15335,PART IV,
15336,PART IV,"The moving Moon went up the sky,"
15337,PART IV,And no where did abide:
15338,PART IV,"Softly she was going up,"
15339,PART IV,And a star or two beside--
15340,PART IV,
15341,PART IV,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main,"
15342,PART IV,Like April hoar-frost spread;
15343,PART IV,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
15344,PART IV,The charmèd water burnt alway
15345,PART IV,A still and awful red.
15346,PART IV,
15347,PART IV,"Beyond the shadow of the ship,"
15348,PART IV,I watched the water-snakes:
15349,PART IV,"They moved in tracks of shining white,"
15350,PART IV,"And when they reared, the elfish light"
15351,PART IV,Fell off in hoary flakes.
15352,PART IV,
15353,PART IV,Within the shadow of the ship
15354,PART IV,I watched their rich attire:
15355,PART IV,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,"
15356,PART IV,They coiled and swam; and every track
15357,PART IV,Was a flash of golden fire.
15358,PART IV,
15359,PART IV,O happy living things! no tongue
15360,PART IV,Their beauty might declare:
15361,PART IV,"A spring of love gushed from my heart,"
15362,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware:
15363,PART IV,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
15364,PART IV,And I blessed them unaware.
15365,PART IV,
15366,PART IV,The self-same moment I could pray;
15367,PART IV,And from my neck so free
15368,PART IV,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
15369,PART IV,Like lead into the sea.
15370,PART IV,
15371,PART IV,
15372,PART V,PART V
15373,PART V,
15374,PART V,"Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing,"
15375,PART V,Beloved from pole to pole!
15376,PART V,To Mary Queen the praise be given!
15377,PART V,"She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven,"
15378,PART V,That slid into my soul.
15379,PART V,
15380,PART V,"The silly buckets on the deck,"
15381,PART V,"That had so long remained,"
15382,PART V,I dreamt that they were filled with dew;
15383,PART V,"And when I awoke, it rained."
15384,PART V,
15385,PART V,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
15386,PART V,My garments all were dank;
15387,PART V,"Sure I had drunken in my dreams,"
15388,PART V,And still my body drank.
15389,PART V,
15390,PART V,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs:"
15391,PART V,I was so light--almost
15392,PART V,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
15393,PART V,And was a blessèd ghost.
15394,PART V,
15395,PART V,And soon I heard a roaring wind:
15396,PART V,It did not come anear;
15397,PART V,"But with its sound it shook the sails,"
15398,PART V,That were so thin and sere.
15399,PART V,
15400,PART V,The upper air burst into life!
15401,PART V,"And a hundred fire-flags sheen,"
15402,PART V,To and fro they were hurried about!
15403,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
15404,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
15405,PART V,
15406,PART V,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
15407,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
15408,PART V,And the rain poured down from one black cloud;
15409,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
15410,PART V,
15411,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
15412,PART V,The Moon was at its side:
15413,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
15414,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,"
15415,PART V,A river steep and wide.
15416,PART V,
15417,PART V,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
15418,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
15419,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
15420,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.
15421,PART V,
15422,PART V,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,"
15423,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
15424,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
15425,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
15426,PART V,
15427,PART V,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;"
15428,PART V,Yet never a breeze up-blew;
15429,PART V,"The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,"
15430,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
15431,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
15432,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.
15433,PART V,
15434,PART V,The body of my brother's son
15435,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
15436,PART V,"The body and I pulled at one rope,"
15437,PART V,"But he said nought to me.""--"
15438,PART V,
15439,PART V,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!""--"
15440,PART V,"""Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!"
15441,PART V,"'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
15442,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
15443,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
15444,PART V,
15445,PART V,"For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,"
15446,PART V,And clustered round the mast;
15447,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
15448,PART V,And from their bodies passed.
15449,PART V,
15450,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
15451,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;
15452,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
15453,PART V,"Now mixed, now one by one."
15454,PART V,
15455,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
15456,PART V,I heard the sky-lark sing;
15457,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,"
15458,PART V,How they seemed to fill the sea and air
15459,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
15460,PART V,
15461,PART V,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
15462,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
15463,PART V,"And now it is an angel's song,"
15464,PART V,That makes the heavens be mute.
15465,PART V,
15466,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
15467,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
15468,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
15469,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,"
15470,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
15471,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
15472,PART V,
15473,PART V,"Till noon we silently sailed on,"
15474,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
15475,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,"
15476,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
15477,PART V,
15478,PART V,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
15479,PART V,"From the land of mist and snow,"
15480,PART V,The spirit slid: and it was he
15481,PART V,That made the ship to go.
15482,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
15483,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
15484,PART V,
15485,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
15486,PART V,Had fixed her to the ocean;
15487,PART V,"But in a minute she 'gan stir,"
15488,PART V,With a short uneasy motion--
15489,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
15490,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
15491,PART V,
15492,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
15493,PART V,She made a sudden bound:
15494,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
15495,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.
15496,PART V,
15497,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
15498,PART V,I have not to declare;
15499,PART V,"But ere my living life returned,"
15500,PART V,I heard and in my soul discerned
15501,PART V,Two voices in the air.
15502,PART V,
15503,PART V,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man?"
15504,PART V,"By him who died on cross,"
15505,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low
15506,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
15507,PART V,
15508,PART V,The spirit who bideth by himself
15509,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
15510,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
15511,PART V,"Who shot him with his bow."""
15512,PART V,
15513,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
15514,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
15515,PART V,"Quoth he, ""The man hath penance done,"
15516,PART V,"And penance more will do."""
15517,PART V,
15518,PART V,
15519,PART VI,PART VI
15520,PART VI,
15521,PART VI,"_First Voice._  ""But tell me, tell me! speak again,"
15522,PART VI,Thy soft response renewing--
15523,PART VI,What makes that ship drive on so fast?
15524,PART VI,"What is the ocean doing?"""
15525,PART VI,
15526,PART VI,"_Second Voice._  ""Still as a slave before his lord,"
15527,PART VI,The ocean hath no blast;
15528,PART VI,His great bright eye most silently
15529,PART VI,Up to the Moon is cast--
15530,PART VI,
15531,PART VI,If he may know which way to go;
15532,PART VI,For she guides him smooth or grim.
15533,PART VI,"See, brother, see I how graciously"
15534,PART VI,"She looketh down on him."""
15535,PART VI,
15536,PART VI,"_First Voice._  ""But why drives on that ship so fast,"
15537,PART VI,"Withouten wave or wind?"""
15538,PART VI,
15539,PART VI,"_Second Voice._  ""The air is cut away before,"
15540,PART VI,And closes from behind.
15541,PART VI,
15542,PART VI,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"
15543,PART VI,Or we shall be belated:
15544,PART VI,"For slow and slow that ship will go,"
15545,PART VI,"When the Mariner's trance is abated.""--"
15546,PART VI,
15547,PART VI,"I woke, and we were sailing on"
15548,PART VI,As in a gentle weather:
15549,PART VI,"'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;"
15550,PART VI,The dead men stood together.
15551,PART VI,
15552,PART VI,"All stood together on the deck,"
15553,PART VI,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:
15554,PART VI,"All fixed on me their stony eyes,"
15555,PART VI,That in the Moon did glitter.
15556,PART VI,
15557,PART VI,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
15558,PART VI,Had never passed away:
15559,PART VI,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,"
15560,PART VI,Nor turn them up to pray.
15561,PART VI,
15562,PART VI,And now this spell was snapt: once more
15563,PART VI,"I viewed the ocean green,"
15564,PART VI,"And looked far forth, yet little saw"
15565,PART VI,Of what had else been seen--
15566,PART VI,
15567,PART VI,"Like one, that on a lonesome road"
15568,PART VI,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
15569,PART VI,"And having once turned round walks on,"
15570,PART VI,And turns no more his head;
15571,PART VI,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend"
15572,PART VI,Doth close behind him tread.
15573,PART VI,
15574,PART VI,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
15575,PART VI,Nor sound nor motion made:
15576,PART VI,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
15577,PART VI,In ripple or in shade.
15578,PART VI,
15579,PART VI,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek"
15580,PART VI,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
15581,PART VI,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
15582,PART VI,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
15583,PART VI,
15584,PART VI,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,"
15585,PART VI,Yet she sailed softly too:
15586,PART VI,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
15587,PART VI,On me alone it blew.
15588,PART VI,
15589,PART VI,Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
15590,PART VI,The light-house top I see?
15591,PART VI,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
15592,PART VI,Is this mine own countree?
15593,PART VI,
15594,PART VI,"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,"
15595,PART VI,And I with sobs did pray--
15596,PART VI,"O let me be awake, my God!"
15597,PART VI,Or let me sleep alway.
15598,PART VI,
15599,PART VI,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
15600,PART VI,So smoothly it was strewn!
15601,PART VI,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
15602,PART VI,And the shadow of the Moon.
15603,PART VI,
15604,PART VI,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,"
15605,PART VI,That stands above the rock:
15606,PART VI,The moonlight steeped in silentness
15607,PART VI,The steady weathercock.
15608,PART VI,
15609,PART VI,"And the bay was white with silent light,"
15610,PART VI,"Till rising from the same,"
15611,PART VI,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
15612,PART VI,In crimson colours came.
15613,PART VI,
15614,PART VI,A little distance from the prow
15615,PART VI,Those crimson shadows were:
15616,PART VI,I turned my eyes upon the deck--
15617,PART VI,"Oh, Christ! what saw I there!"
15618,PART VI,
15619,PART VI,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
15620,PART VI,"And, by the holy rood!"
15621,PART VI,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
15622,PART VI,On every corse there stood.
15623,PART VI,
15624,PART VI,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
15625,PART VI,It was a heavenly sight!
15626,PART VI,"They stood as signals to the land,"
15627,PART VI,Each one a lovely light;
15628,PART VI,
15629,PART VI,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
15630,PART VI,No voice did they impart--
15631,PART VI,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
15632,PART VI,Like music on my heart.
15633,PART VI,
15634,PART VI,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,"
15635,PART VI,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
15636,PART VI,"My head was turned perforce away,"
15637,PART VI,And I saw a boat appear.
15638,PART VI,
15639,PART VI,"The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,"
15640,PART VI,I heard them coming fast:
15641,PART VI,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
15642,PART VI,The dead men could not blast.
15643,PART VI,
15644,PART VI,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
15645,PART VI,It is the Hermit good!
15646,PART VI,He singeth loud his godly hymns
15647,PART VI,That he makes in the wood.
15648,PART VI,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
15649,PART VI,The Albatross's blood.
15650,PART VI,
15651,PART VII,PART VII
15652,PART VII,
15653,PART VII,This Hermit good lives in that wood
15654,PART VII,Which slopes down to the sea.
15655,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
15656,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
15657,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
15658,PART VII,
15659,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
15660,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:
15661,PART VII,It is the moss that wholly hides
15662,PART VII,The rotted old oak-stump.
15663,PART VII,
15664,PART VII,"The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk,"
15665,PART VII,"""Why, this is strange, I trow!"
15666,PART VII,"Where are those lights so many and fair,"
15667,PART VII,"That signal made but now?"""
15668,PART VII,
15669,PART VII,"""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said--"
15670,PART VII,"""And they answered not our cheer!"
15671,PART VII,"The planks looked warped! and see those sails,"
15672,PART VII,How thin they are and sere!
15673,PART VII,"I never saw aught like to them,"
15674,PART VII,Unless perchance it were
15675,PART VII,
15676,PART VII,Brown skeletons of leaves that lag
15677,PART VII,My forest-brook along;
15678,PART VII,"When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
15679,PART VII,"And the owlet whoops to the wolf below,"
15680,PART VII,"That eats the she-wolf's young."""
15681,PART VII,
15682,PART VII,"""Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look--"
15683,PART VII,(The Pilot made reply)
15684,PART VII,"I am a-feared""--""Push on, push on!"""
15685,PART VII,Said the Hermit cheerily.
15686,PART VII,
15687,PART VII,"The boat came closer to the ship,"
15688,PART VII,But I nor spake nor stirred;
15689,PART VII,"The boat came close beneath the ship,"
15690,PART VII,And straight a sound was heard.
15691,PART VII,
15692,PART VII,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
15693,PART VII,Still louder and more dread:
15694,PART VII,"It reached the ship, it split the bay;"
15695,PART VII,The ship went down like lead.
15696,PART VII,
15697,PART VII,"Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound,"
15698,PART VII,"Which sky and ocean smote,"
15699,PART VII,Like one that hath been seven days drowned
15700,PART VII,My body lay afloat;
15701,PART VII,"But swift as dreams, myself I found"
15702,PART VII,Within the Pilot's boat.
15703,PART VII,
15704,PART VII,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship,"
15705,PART VII,The boat spun round and round;
15706,PART VII,"And all was still, save that the hill"
15707,PART VII,Was telling of the sound.
15708,PART VII,
15709,PART VII,I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked
15710,PART VII,And fell down in a fit;
15711,PART VII,"The holy Hermit raised his eyes,"
15712,PART VII,And prayed where he did sit.
15713,PART VII,
15714,PART VII,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
15715,PART VII,"Who now doth crazy go,"
15716,PART VII,"Laughed loud and long, and all the while"
15717,PART VII,His eyes went to and fro.
15718,PART VII,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see,"
15719,PART VII,"The Devil knows how to row."""
15720,PART VII,
15721,PART VII,"And now, all in my own countree,"

15723,PART VII,"The Hermit stepped forth from the boat,"
15724,PART VII,And scarcely he could stand.
15725,PART VII,
15726,PART VII,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"""
15727,PART VII,The Hermit crossed his brow.

15730,PART VII,
15731,PART VII,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched
15732,PART VII,"With a woful agony,"
15733,PART VII,Which forced me to begin my tale;
15734,PART VII,And then it left me free.
15735,PART VII,
15736,PART VII,"Since then, at an uncertain hour,"
15737,PART VII,That agony returns:

15740,PART VII,
15741,PART VII,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
15742,PART VII,I have strange power of speech;
15743,PART VII,"That moment that his face I see,"
15744,PART VII,I know the man that must hear me:
15745,PART VII,To him my tale I teach.
15746,PART VII,
15747,PART VII,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
15748,PART VII,The wedding-guests are there:
15749,PART VII,But in the garden-bower the bride
15750,PART VII,And bride-maids singing are:
15751,PART VII,"And hark the little vesper bell,"
15752,PART VII,Which biddeth me to prayer!
15753,PART VII,
15754,PART VII,O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been
15755,PART VII,Alone on a wide wide sea:
15756,PART VII,"So lonely 'twas, that God himself"
15757,PART VII,Scarce seemèd there to be.
15758,PART VII,
15759,PART VII,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast,"
15760,PART VII,"'Tis sweeter far to me,"
15761,PART VII,To walk together to the kirk
15762,PART VII,With a goodly company!--
15763,PART VII,
15764,PART VII,"To walk together to the kirk,"
15765,PART VII,"And all together pray,"
15766,PART VII,"While each to his great Father bends,"
15767,PART VII,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends"
15768,PART VII,And youths and maidens gay!
15769,PART VII,
15770,PART VII,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
15771,PART VII,"To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!"
15772,PART VII,"He prayeth well, who loveth well"
15773,PART VII,Both man and bird and beast.
15774,PART VII,
15775,PART VII,"He prayeth best, who loveth best"
15776,PART VII,All things both great and small;
15777,PART VII,"For the dear God who loveth us,"

15780,PART VII,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright,"
15781,PART VII,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
15782,PART VII,Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest
15783,PART VII,Turned from the bridegroom's door.
15784,PART VII,
15785,PART VII,"He went like one that hath been stunned,"
15786,PART VII,And is of sense forlorn:
15787,PART VII,"A sadder and a wiser man,"
15788,PART VII,He rose the morrow morn.

15959,404                     KUBLA KHAN,Where was heard the mingled measure
15960,404                     KUBLA KHAN,From the fountain and the caves.
15961,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"It was a miracle of rare device,"
15962,404                     KUBLA KHAN,A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!

15968,404                     KUBLA KHAN,Singing of Mount Abora.
15969,404                     KUBLA KHAN,Could I revive within me
15970,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"Her symphony and song,"

15972,404                     KUBLA KHAN,That with music loud and long
15973,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"I would build that dome in air,"
15974,404                     KUBLA KHAN,That sunny dome! those caves of ice!
15975,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"And all who heard should see them there,"
15976,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!"
15977,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"His flashing eyes, his floating hair!"
15978,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"Weave a circle round him thrice,"
15979,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"And close your eyes with holy dread,"
15980,404                     KUBLA KHAN,"For he on honey-dew hath fed,"
15981,404                     KUBLA KHAN,And drunk the milk of Paradise....

16149,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,It was of earth and came not by the air;
16150,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,The earth was cooling and drew down the sky.
16151,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,The air was crumbling.  There was no more sky.
16152,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,"Rails of a broken bed charred in the grate,"
16153,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,And when he touched the bars he thought the sting
16154,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,Came from their heat--he could not feel such cold...

16159,409                THE END OF THE WORLD,He closed them thus but now of his own will.

16182,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,A passing ship at dawn had brought
16183,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"The news; and quickly we set sail,"
16184,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,To find out what strange thing might ail
16185,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,The keepers of the deep-sea light.
16186,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16187,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"The Winter day broke blue and bright,"
16188,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"With glancing sun and glancing spray,"
16189,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"While o'er the swell our boat made way,"
16190,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,As gallant as a gull in flight.
16191,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16192,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"But as we neared the lonely Isle,"
16193,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And looked up at the naked height,"
16194,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And saw the lighthouse towering white,"
16195,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"With blinded lantern, that all night"
16196,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Had never shot a spark
16197,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Of comfort through the dark,"
16198,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,So ghostly in the cold sunlight
16199,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"It seemed, that we were struck the while"
16200,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,With wonder all too dread for words.
16201,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16202,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And as into the tiny creek
16203,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We stole beneath the hanging crag,"
16204,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We saw three queer, black, ugly birds--"
16205,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Too big, by far, in my belief,"
16206,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,For cormorant or shag--
16207,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Like seamen sitting bolt-upright
16208,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Upon a half-tide reef:
16209,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"But, as we neared, they plunged from sight,"
16210,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Without a sound, or spurt of white."
16211,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16212,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And still too mazed to speak,"
16213,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,We landed; and made fast the boat;
16214,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And climbed the track in single file,"
16215,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Each wishing he were safe afloat,"
16216,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"On any sea, however far,"
16217,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,So it be far from Flannan Isle:
16218,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And still we seemed to climb, and climb,"
16219,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"As though we'd lost all count of time,"
16220,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And so must climb for evermore.
16221,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Yet, all too soon, we reached the door"
16222,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"The black, sun-blistered lighthouse-door,"
16223,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,That gaped for us ajar.
16224,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16225,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"As, on the threshold, for a spell,"
16226,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We paused, we seemed to breathe the smell"
16227,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Of limewash and of tar,"
16228,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Familiar as our daily breath,"
16229,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,As though 'twere some strange scent of death:
16230,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And so, yet wondering, side by side,"
16231,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We stood a moment, still tongue-tied:"
16232,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And each with black foreboding eyed
16233,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"The door, ere we should fling it wide,"
16234,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,To leave the sunlight for the gloom:
16235,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Till, plucking courage up, at last,"
16236,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Hard on each other's heels we passed,"
16237,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Into the living-room.
16238,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16239,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Yet, as we crowded through the door,"
16240,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We only saw a table, spread"
16241,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"For dinner, meat and cheese and bread;"
16242,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"But, all untouched; and no one there:"
16243,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"As though, when they sat down to eat,"
16244,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Ere they could even taste,"
16245,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Alarm had come; and they in haste
16246,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Had risen and left the bread and meat:
16247,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,For at the table-head a chair
16248,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Lay tumbled on the floor.
16249,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16250,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,We listened; but we only heard
16251,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,The feeble cheeping of a bird
16252,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,That starved upon its perch:
16253,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And, listening still, without a word,"
16254,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,We set about our hopeless search.
16255,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16256,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We hunted high, we hunted low;"
16257,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And soon ransacked the empty house;
16258,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Then o'er the Island, to and fro,"
16259,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We ranged, to listen and to look"
16260,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"In every cranny, cleft or nook"
16261,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,That might have hid a bird or mouse:
16262,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"But, though we searched from shore to shore"
16263,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,We found no sign in any place:
16264,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And soon again stood face to face
16265,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Before the gaping door:
16266,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And stole into the room once more
16267,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,As frightened children steal.
16268,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Ay: though we hunted high and low,"
16269,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And hunted everywhere,"
16270,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Of the three men's fate we found no trace
16271,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Of any kind in any place,"
16272,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"But a door ajar, and an untouched meal,"
16273,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And an overtoppled chair.
16274,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16275,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And as we listened in the gloom
16276,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Of that forsaken living-room--
16277,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,A chill clutch on our breath--
16278,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,We thought how ill-chance came to all
16279,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Who kept the Flannan Light:
16280,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And how the rock had been the death
16281,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Of many a likely lad:
16282,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"How six had come to a sudden end,"
16283,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And three had gone stark mad:
16284,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And one whom we'd all known as friend
16285,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Had leapt from the lantern one still night,"
16286,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And fallen dead by the lighthouse wall:
16287,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And long we thought
16288,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"On the three we sought,"
16289,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And of what might yet befall.
16290,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16291,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Like curs a glance has brought to heel,"
16292,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We listened, flinching there:"
16293,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"And looked, and looked, on the untouched meal,"
16294,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,And the overtoppled chair.
16295,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,
16296,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"We seemed to stand for an endless while,"
16297,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Though still no word was said,"
16298,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,"Three men alive on Flannan Isle,"
16299,410                    FLANNAN ISLE,Who thought on three men dead.
