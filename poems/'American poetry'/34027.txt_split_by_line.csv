82,THRENODY IN MAY,(In memory of Madison Cawein.)
83,THRENODY IN MAY,
84,THRENODY IN MAY,
85,THRENODY IN MAY,"Again the earth, miraculous with May,"
86,THRENODY IN MAY,Unfolds its vernal arras. Yesteryear
87,THRENODY IN MAY,"We strolled together 'neath the greening trees,"
88,THRENODY IN MAY,"And heard the robin tune its flute note clear,"
89,THRENODY IN MAY,And watched above the white cloud squadrons veer.
90,THRENODY IN MAY,And saw their shifting shadows drift away
91,THRENODY IN MAY,"Adown the Hudson, as ships seek the seas."
92,THRENODY IN MAY,The scene is still the same. The violet
93,THRENODY IN MAY,Unlids its virgin eye; its amber ore
94,THRENODY IN MAY,"The dandelion shows, and yet, and yet,"
95,THRENODY IN MAY,"He comes no more, no more!"
96,THRENODY IN MAY,
97,THRENODY IN MAY,"He of the open and the generous heart,"
98,THRENODY IN MAY,"The soul that sensed all flowerful loveliness,"
99,THRENODY IN MAY,The nature as the nature of a child;
100,THRENODY IN MAY,Who found some rapture in the wind's caress.
101,THRENODY IN MAY,Beauty in humble weed and mint and cress.
102,THRENODY IN MAY,"And sang, with his incomparable art,"
103,THRENODY IN MAY,The magic wonder of the wood and wild.
104,THRENODY IN MAY,The little people of the reeds and grass
105,THRENODY IN MAY,"Murmur their blithe, companionable lore,"
106,THRENODY IN MAY,"The rills renew their minstrelsy. Alas,"
107,THRENODY IN MAY,"He comes no more, no more!"
108,THRENODY IN MAY,
109,THRENODY IN MAY,"And yet it seems as though he needs must come,"
110,THRENODY IN MAY,"Albeit he has cast off mortality,"
111,THRENODY IN MAY,"Such was his passion for the bourgeoning time,"
112,THRENODY IN MAY,Such to his spirit was the ecstasy
113,THRENODY IN MAY,"The hills and valleys chorus when set free,"
114,THRENODY IN MAY,"No music mute, no lyric instinct dumb,"
115,THRENODY IN MAY,But keyed to utterance of immortal rhyme.
116,THRENODY IN MAY,"Ah, haply in some other fairer spring"
117,THRENODY IN MAY,"He sees bright tides sweep over slope and shore,"
118,THRENODY IN MAY,But here how vain is ell my visioning!
119,THRENODY IN MAY,"He comes no more, no more!"
120,THRENODY IN MAY,
121,THRENODY IN MAY,"Poet and friend, wherever you may fare"
122,THRENODY IN MAY,"Enwrapt in dreams, I love to think of you"
123,THRENODY IN MAY,"Wandering amid the meads of asphodel,"
124,THRENODY IN MAY,Holding high converse with the exalted few
125,THRENODY IN MAY,Who sought and found below the elusive clue
126,THRENODY IN MAY,"To beauty, and in that diviner air"
127,THRENODY IN MAY,Bowing in worship still to its sweet spell.
128,THRENODY IN MAY,"Why sorrow, then, though fate unkindly lays"
129,THRENODY IN MAY,"Upon our questioning hearts this burden sore,"
130,THRENODY IN MAY,And though through all our length of hastening days
131,THRENODY IN MAY,"He comes no more, no more!"

139,FOREWORD,
140,FOREWORD,
141,FOREWORD,"It is with a sense of sadness and regret that this book, written by one"
142,FOREWORD,who universally has endeared himself to lovers of nature through his
143,FOREWORD,"revelation of her mysteries, must be prefaced as containing the last"
144,FOREWORD,songs of this exquisite singer of the South.
145,FOREWORD,
146,FOREWORD,When the final word is spoken it is fitting that it be by one of
147,FOREWORD,"authority. William Dean Howells, in the pages of _The North American"
148,FOREWORD,"Review_, offers this tribute:"
149,FOREWORD,
150,FOREWORD,"""I had read his poetry and loved it from the beginning, and in each"
151,FOREWORD,"successive expression of it, I had delighted in its expanding and"
152,FOREWORD,maturing beauty. Between the earliest and the latest thing there may
153,FOREWORD,have been a hundred different things in the swan-like life of a singer
154,FOREWORD,... but we take the latest as if it summed him up in motive and range
155,FOREWORD,and tendency.... Not one of his lovely landscapes but thrilled with a
156,FOREWORD,human presence penetrating to it from his most sensitive and subtle
157,FOREWORD,"spirit until it was all but painfully alive with memories, with regrets,"
158,FOREWORD,"with longings, with hopes, with all that from time to time mutably"
159,FOREWORD,"constitutes us men and women, and yet keeps us children. He has the"
160,FOREWORD,"gift, in a measure, that I do not think surpassed in any poet, of"
161,FOREWORD,"touching some commonest thing in nature, and making it live, from the"
162,FOREWORD,"manifold associations in which we have our being, and glow thereafter"
163,FOREWORD,with an indistinguishable beauty.... No other poet can outword this poet
164,FOREWORD,"when it comes to choosing some epithet fresh from the earth and air, and"
165,FOREWORD,"with the morning sun and light upon it, for an emotion or an experience"
166,FOREWORD,in which the race renews its youth from generation to generation.... His
167,FOREWORD,touch leaves everything that was dull to the sense before glowing in the
168,FOREWORD,"light of joyful recognition."""
169,FOREWORD,
170,FOREWORD,With a tone of conviction Edwin Markham says:
171,FOREWORD,
172,FOREWORD,"""No other poet of the later American choir offers so large a collection"
173,FOREWORD,"of verse as Mr. Cawein does, and no other American minstrel has so"
174,FOREWORD,"unvarying a devotion to nature. And none other, perhaps, has so keen an"
175,FOREWORD,"eye, so sure a word for nature's magic of mood, her trick of color, her"
176,FOREWORD,"change of form. He is not so wild and far-flying as Bliss Carmen, nor so"
177,FOREWORD,large and elemental as Joaquin Miller; but he is often as delicate and
178,FOREWORD,"eerie as Aldrich, and sometimes as warm and rich as Keats in the April"
179,FOREWORD,"affluence of 'Endymion.'"""
180,FOREWORD,
181,FOREWORD,"""Mr. Cawein's landscape is not the sea, nor the desert, nor the"
182,FOREWORD,"mountain, but the lovely inland levels of his Kentucky. His work is"
183,FOREWORD,almost wholly objective. A dash more of human import mixed into the
184,FOREWORD,beauty and melody of his poetry would rank him with Lowell and the other
185,FOREWORD,"great lyrists of our elder choir."""
186,FOREWORD,
187,FOREWORD,"Some of the new poems portray a high moral passion, potent with the"
188,FOREWORD,"belief of life beyond, where his delicacy of vision penetrates the"
189,FOREWORD,shadow and seems to have sighted the shore that has given his soul
190,FOREWORD,"greeting ""somewhere yonder in a world uncharted."""
191,FOREWORD,
192,FOREWORD,"Clear, sure, and strong is the vocal loveliness and inevitable word with"
193,FOREWORD,which this poet endears the little forms of life in the field of Faery.
194,FOREWORD,"The ""Song of Songs"" (1913) could be characterized as prophecy, by one in"
195,FOREWORD,whom seemed inherent the fatal instinct of the predestined. He sought
196,FOREWORD,"for ""Song to lead her way above the crags of wrong,"" and he gave"
197,FOREWORD,
198,FOREWORD,"""Such music as a bird"
199,FOREWORD,Gives of its soul when dying
200,FOREWORD,"Unconscious if it's heard!"""
201,FOREWORD,"And so he went, singing, to his ""Islands of Infinity."""

596,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
597,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"And as I leaned and looked, it seemed"
598,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,Vague shadows gathered there and here--
599,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"A dream, perhaps the water dreamed"
600,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Of some wild past, some long-dead year...."
601,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
602,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,A temple of a race unblessed
603,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Rose huge within a hollow land,"
604,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Where, on an altar, bare of breast,"
605,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"One lay, a man, bound foot and hand."
606,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
607,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"A priest, who served some hideous god,"
608,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Stood near him on the altar stair,"
609,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,Clothed on with gold; and at his nod
610,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,A multitude seemed gathered there.
611,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
612,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,I saw a sword descend; and then
613,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,The priest before the altar turned;
614,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"He was not formed like mortal man,"
615,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,But like a beast whose eyeballs burned.
616,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
617,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Amorphous, strangely old, he glared"
618,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Above the victim he had slain,"
619,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Who lay with bleeding bosom bared,"
620,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,From which dripped slow a crimson rain.
621,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
622,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,Then turned to me a face of stone
623,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"And mocked above the murdered dead,"
624,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,That fixed its cold eyes on his own
625,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,And cursed him with a look of dread.
626,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
627,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"And then, it seemed, I knew the place,"
628,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,And how this sacrifice befell:
629,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"I knew the god, the priest's wild face,"
630,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,I knew the dead man--knew him well.
631,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
632,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"And as I stooped again to look,"
633,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"I heard the dark hills sigh and laugh,"
634,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,And in the pool the water shook
635,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,As if one stirred it with a staff.
636,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
637,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,And all was still again and clear:
638,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"The pool lay crystal as before,"
639,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,Temple and priest were gone; the mere
640,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,Had closed again its magic door.
641,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
642,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,A face was there; it seemed to shine
643,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,As round it died the sunset's flame--
644,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,The victim's face?--or was it mine?--
645,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,They were to me the very same.
646,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
647,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"And yet, and yet--could this thing be?--"
648,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"And in my soul I seemed to know,"
649,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"At once, this was a memory"
650,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Of some past life, lived long ago."
651,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,
652,_LORDS OF THE VISIONARY EYE_,"Recorded by some secret sense,"

736,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,In the woods of Trebizend.
737,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,
738,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,Hate crouched near him as he strode
739,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,"Through the blackness of the road,"

741,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,

749,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,
750,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,He went singing; and a rose
751,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,Lay upon his heart's repose--
752,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,With what thought of her--who knows?
753,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,
754,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,He had done no other wrong

765,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,

781,_THE TROUBADOUR OF TREBIZEND_,

1015,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,A simpler name there could not be--Julia:
1016,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,But seeing it I seemed to see
1017,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,"A Devon garden,--pleasantly"
1018,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,"About a parsonage,--the bee"
1019,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,Made drowsy-sweet; where rosemary
1020,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,And pink and phlox and peony
1021,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,Bowed down to one
1022,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,Whom Herrick made to bloom in Poetry.

1028,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,"Herrick himself passed by, sun-tanned,"
1029,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,And smiling; and the quiet land
1030,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,Seemed to take on and understand
1031,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,"A dream long dreamed,"
1032,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,And for the lives of two some gladness planned.
1033,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,
1034,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,"And then I seemed to hear a sigh,--""Julia!"""

1036,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,The leaves shook; and a butterfly
1037,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,Trailed past; and through the sleepy sky
1038,_THE NAME ON THE TREE_,"A bird flew, crying strange its cry--"

1086,_THE HAUNTED GARDEN_,Lean as hunger; like the shade

1251,_MOON FAIRIES_,And coo of a dove that grieves.
1252,_MOON FAIRIES_,
1253,_MOON FAIRIES_,And the Elfin bore on its back
1254,_MOON FAIRIES_,A little faery pack
1255,_MOON FAIRIES_,Of forest scents: of loam

1257,_MOON FAIRIES_,And of its contents breathed
1258,_MOON FAIRIES_,As might a clod of ground
1259,_MOON FAIRIES_,Feeling a bud unsheathed

1267,_MOON FAIRIES_,"Shook emerald seeds of dreams,"

1429,_THE LOST DREAM_,Beneath the door I heard it breathe--
1430,_THE LOST DREAM_,A beast that growled in vain.
1431,_THE LOST DREAM_,
1432,_THE LOST DREAM_,"The hunter wind stalked up and down,"
1433,_THE LOST DREAM_,And crashed his ice-spears through each tree;
1434,_THE LOST DREAM_,"Before his rage, in tattered gown,"
1435,_THE LOST DREAM_,I saw the maid moon flee.
1436,_THE LOST DREAM_,
1437,_THE LOST DREAM_,There stole a footstep to my door;

1441,_THE LOST DREAM_,
1442,_THE LOST DREAM_,"He beckoned me; he bade me rise,"

1444,_THE LOST DREAM_,"Into my heart's core pierced his eyes,"
1445,_THE LOST DREAM_,And lifted me with might.
1446,_THE LOST DREAM_,
1447,_THE LOST DREAM_,I rose; I made no more delay;
1448,_THE LOST DREAM_,And followed where his eyes compelled;
1449,_THE LOST DREAM_,"And through the darkness, far away,"
1450,_THE LOST DREAM_,They lit me and enspelled.
1451,_THE LOST DREAM_,
1452,_THE LOST DREAM_,"Until we reached an ancient wood,"
1453,_THE LOST DREAM_,"That flung its twisted arms around,"
1454,_THE LOST DREAM_,As if in anguish that it stood
1455,_THE LOST DREAM_,"On dark, unhallowed ground."
1456,_THE LOST DREAM_,
1457,_THE LOST DREAM_,And then I saw it--cold and blind--
1458,_THE LOST DREAM_,"The dream, that had my heart to share,"
