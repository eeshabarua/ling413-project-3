52,PREFATORY NOTE,
53,PREFATORY NOTE,The gay verses which celebrate undergraduate life must not be taken too
54,PREFATORY NOTE,"seriously. They seldom pretend to the dignity of poetry. College verse,"
55,PREFATORY NOTE,"if I understand it, is verse suited to the period and point of view of"
56,PREFATORY NOTE,"undergraduate days. Light, graceful, humorous, sparkling,--this it"
57,PREFATORY NOTE,"should be for the most part; serious sometimes, it is true,--for young"
58,PREFATORY NOTE,men and women about to take upon themselves the responsibilities of
59,PREFATORY NOTE,"mature life are at heart by no means frivolous, but touching the note of"
60,PREFATORY NOTE,"grief, if at all, almost as though by accident. Life is often sad enough"
61,PREFATORY NOTE,"in the after-years, and for the period of sorrow, sad verse may be in"
62,PREFATORY NOTE,place. Happy they who have not yet traded cap and bells (never far
63,PREFATORY NOTE,hidden under cap and gown) for the
64,PREFATORY NOTE,
65,PREFATORY NOTE,"""Sable stole of cypress lawn."""
66,PREFATORY NOTE,
67,PREFATORY NOTE,Happier still if they never need make such a sorry exchange.
68,PREFATORY NOTE,
69,PREFATORY NOTE,"Yes, like all sound art, college verse must, above all else, be honest."
70,PREFATORY NOTE,"Let us not say, however, that the thoughtful moods of young men and"
71,PREFATORY NOTE,women may not sincerely be set to the music of verse. One department in
72,PREFATORY NOTE,"this collection bears the name ""In Serious Mood,"" and its sentiment"
73,PREFATORY NOTE,rings as true as that of any other.
74,PREFATORY NOTE,
75,PREFATORY NOTE,"In looking over very many undergraduate papers, I have been struck with"
76,PREFATORY NOTE,"several facts. I will give them for what they are worth, leaving their"
77,PREFATORY NOTE,"explanation to others. First, there seems to be a general fondness for"
78,PREFATORY NOTE,"the sonnet, and a very general lack of success in writing it. Second,"
79,PREFATORY NOTE,the French forms of light verse are exceedingly popular--particularly
80,PREFATORY NOTE,"the rondeau, ballade, and triolet. These, more easily lending themselves"
81,PREFATORY NOTE,"to gay moods than does the sonnet, are written with much greater"
82,PREFATORY NOTE,"success. Triolets are perhaps least often, rondeaus most often,"
83,PREFATORY NOTE,"successful. Third, purely sentimental verse is little written in women's"
84,PREFATORY NOTE,"colleges, its place being taken by poetry of nature or of reflection."
85,PREFATORY NOTE,"Oddly enough, when it _is_ attempted, the writer usually fancies herself"
86,PREFATORY NOTE,"the lover, and describes feminine, not masculine, beauty. College girls"
87,PREFATORY NOTE,"show possibly more maturity of reflective power than do their brothers,"
88,PREFATORY NOTE,"but they are notably weaker in the sense of humor. Fourth, amongst so"
89,PREFATORY NOTE,"much merely graceful verse, there are not wanting touches here and there"
90,PREFATORY NOTE,of genuine poetry. I shall be disappointed if the reader does not
91,PREFATORY NOTE,discover many such in this little book.
92,PREFATORY NOTE,
93,PREFATORY NOTE,"While I have confined myself, for the most part, to verse printed in the"
94,PREFATORY NOTE,"college publications of the past five years, I have overstepped this"
95,PREFATORY NOTE,"limit in a few instances. None of the poems in the present book,"
96,PREFATORY NOTE,"however, were included in the first series published in 1892."
97,PREFATORY NOTE,
98,PREFATORY NOTE,"Thanks are due Messrs. Andrus & Church, of Ithaca, N.Y., for their"
99,PREFATORY NOTE,"generous loan of bound files of the _Cornell Era_, to the assistant"
100,PREFATORY NOTE,"librarian of Harvard University for numerous courtesies, and to the"
101,PREFATORY NOTE,"editors of many college papers, without whose kind cooperation the"
102,PREFATORY NOTE,"second series of ""Cap and Gown"" would have been impossible."
