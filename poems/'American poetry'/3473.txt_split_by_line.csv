148,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",and a personality so withdrawn as that of Emma Lazarus; but while her
149,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","memory is fresh, and the echo of her songs still lingers in these pages,"
150,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","we feel it a duty to call up her presence once more, and to note the"
151,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",traits that made it remarkable and worthy to shine out clearly before
152,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",the world. Of dramatic episode or climax in her life there is none;
153,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","outwardly all was placid and serene, like an untroubled stream whose"
154,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","depths alone hold the strong, quick tide. The story of her life is the"
155,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","story of a mind, of a spirit, ever seeking, ever striving, and pressing"
156,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",onward and upward to new truth and light. Her works are the mirror of
157,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","this progress. In reviewing them, the first point that strikes us is the"
158,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","precocity, or rather the spontaneity, of her poetic gift. She was a born"
159,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","singer; poetry was her natural language, and to write was less effort"
160,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","than to speak, for she was a shy, sensitive child, with strange reserves"
161,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","and reticences, not easily putting herself ""en rapport"" with those"
162,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",around her. Books were her world from her earliest years; in them she
163,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",literally lost and found herself. She was eleven years old when the War
164,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","of Succession broke out, which inspired her first lyric outbursts."
165,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",Her poems and translations written between the ages of fourteen and
166,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","seventeen were collected, and constituted her first published volume."
167,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","Crude and immature as these productions naturally were, and utterly"
168,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","condemned by the writer's later judgment, they are, nevertheless, highly"
169,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","interesting and characteristic, giving, as they do, the keynote of"
170,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",much that afterwards unfolded itself in her life. One cannot fail to
171,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",be rather painfully impressed by the profound melancholy pervading the
172,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","book. The opening poem is ""In Memoriam,""--on the death of a school"
173,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",friend and companion; and the two following poems also have death for
174,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","theme. ""On a Lock of my Mother's Hair"" gives us reflections on growing"
175,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",old. These are the four poems written at the age of fourteen. There is
176,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","not a wholly glad and joyous strain in the volume, and we might smile"
177,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","at the recurrence of broken vows, broken hearts, and broken lives in the"
178,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","experience of this maiden just entered upon her teens, were it not"
179,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",that the innocent child herself is in such deadly earnest. The two long
180,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","narrative poems, ""Bertha"" and ""Elfrida,"" are tragic in the extreme. Both"
181,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","are dashed off apparently at white heat: ""Elfrida,"" over fifteen hundred"
182,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","lines of blank verse, in two weeks; ""Bertha,"" in three and a half. We"
183,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","have said that Emma Lazarus was a born singer, but she did not sing,"
184,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","like a bird, for joy of being alive; and of being young, alas! there is"
185,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","no hint in these youthful effusions, except inasmuch as this unrelieved"
186,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","gloom, this ignorance of ""values,"" so to speak, is a sign of youth,"
187,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",common especially among gifted persons of acute and premature
188,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","sensibilities, whose imagination, not yet focused by reality,"
189,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","overreached the mark. With Emma Lazarus, however, this sombre streak has"
190,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",a deeper root; something of birth and temperament is in it--the stamp
191,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",and heritage of a race born to suffer. But dominant and fundamental
192,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","though it was, Hebraism was only latent thus far. It was classic"
193,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",and romantic art that first attracted and inspired her. She pictures
194,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","Aphrodite the beautiful, arising from the waves, and the beautiful"
195,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","Apollo and his loves,--Daphne, pursued by the god, changing into the"
196,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","laurel, and the enamored Clytie into the faithful sunflower. Beauty, for"
197,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","its own sake, supreme and unconditional, charmed her primarily and"
198,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","to the end. Her restless spirit found repose in the pagan idea,--the"
199,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","absolute unity and identity of man with nature, as symbolized in the"
200,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","Greek myths, where every natural force becomes a person, and where, in"
201,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","turn, persons pass with equal readiness and freedom back into nature"
202,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",again.
203,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",
204,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",In this connection a name would suggest itself even if it did not
205,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","appear,--Heine, the Greek, Heine the Jew, Heine the Romanticist, as Emma"
206,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",Lazarus herself has styled him; and already in this early volume of hers
207,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",we have trace of the kinship and affinity that afterwards so plainly
208,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",declared itself. Foremost among the translations are a number of
209,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","his songs, rendered with a finesse and a literalness that are rarely"
210,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","combined. Four years later, at the age of twenty-one, she published her"
211,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","second volume, ""Admetus and Other Poems,"" which at once took rank as"
212,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","literature both in America and England, and challenged comparison with"
213,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","the work of established writers. Of classic themes we have ""Admetus"" and"
214,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","""Orpheus,"" and of romantic the legend of Tannhauser and of the saintly"
215,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",Lohengrin. All are treated with an artistic finish that shows perfect
216,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","mastery of her craft, without detracting from the freshness and flow of"
217,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","her inspiration. While sounding no absolutely new note in the world,"
218,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","she yet makes us aware of a talent of unusual distinction, and a highly"
219,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","endowed nature,--a sort of tact of sentiment and expression, an instinct"
220,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","of the true and beautiful, and that quick intuition which is like"
221,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",second-sight in its sensitiveness to apprehend and respond to external
222,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",stimulus. But it is not the purely imaginative poems in this volume that
223,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",most deeply interest us. We come upon experience of life in these pages;
224,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","not in the ordinary sense, however, of outward activity and movement,"
225,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","but in the hidden undercurrent of being. ""The epochs of our life are not"
226,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","in the visible facts, but in the silent thoughts by the wayside as we"
227,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","walk."" This is the motto, drawn from Emerson, which she chooses for her"
228,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","poem of ""Epochs,"" which marks a pivotal moment in her life. Difficult"
229,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","to analyze, difficult above all to convey, if we would not encroach"
230,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","upon the domain of private and personal experience, is the drift of"
231,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","this poem, or rather cycle of poems, that ring throughout with a deeper"
232,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",accent and a more direct appeal than has yet made itself felt. It is the

984,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"in March, 1885. The blow was a crushing one for Emma. Truly, the silver"
985,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"cord was loosed, and the golden bowl broken. Life lost its meaning and"
986,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,charm. Her father's sympathy and pride in her work had been her chief
987,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"incentive and ambition, and had spurred her on when her own confidence"
988,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and spirit failed. Never afterwards did she find complete and
989,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,spontaneous expression. She decided to go abroad as the best means
990,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,of regaining composure and strength and sailed once more in May for

1036,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"""It is all heart-breaking.  I don't only mean those beautiful"

1042,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"True to her old attractions, it is pagan Rome that appeals to her most"

1044,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,

1049,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"standing out against this lapis-lazuli sky, or a tremendous"

1055,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Already, in February, spring is in the air; ""the almond-trees are in"
1056,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"bloom, violets cover the grass, and oh! the divine, the celestial, the"
1057,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"unheard-of beauty of it all!"" It is almost a pang for her, ""with its"
1058,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"strange mixture of longing and regret and delight,"" and in the midst"
1059,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"of it she says, ""I have to exert all my strength not to lose myself in"
1060,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"morbidness and depression."""
1061,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1062,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Early in March she leaves Rome, consoled with the thought of returning"
1063,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"the following winter. In June she was in England again, and spent the"
1064,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,summer at Malvern. Disease was no doubt already beginning to prey upon
1065,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"her, for she was oppressed at times by a languor and heaviness amounting"
1066,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"almost to lethargy. When she returned to London, however, in September,"
1067,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"she felt quite well again, and started for another tour in Holland,"
1068,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"which she enjoyed as much as before. She then settled in Paris, to await"
1069,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,the time when she could return to Italy. But she was attacked at once
1070,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"with grave and alarming symptoms, that betokened a fatal end to her"
1071,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"malady. Entirely ignorant, however, of the danger that threatened her,"
1072,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"she kept up courage and hope, made plans for the journey, and looked"
1073,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,forward to setting out at any moment. But the weeks passed and the
1074,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,months also; slowly and gradually the hope faded. The journey to Italy
1075,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"must be given up; she was not in condition to be brought home, and she"
1076,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"reluctantly resigned herself to remain where she was and ""convalesce,"""
1077,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"as she confidently believed, in the spring. Once again came the analogy,"
1078,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"which she herself pointed out now, to Heine on his mattress-grave in"
1079,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Paris. She, too, the last time she went out, dragged herself to the"
1080,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Louvre, to the feet of the Venus, ""the goddess without arms, who could"
1081,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"not help."" Only her indomitable will and intense desire to live seemed"
1082,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"to keep her alive. She sunk to a very low ebb, but, as she herself"
1083,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"expressed it, she ""seemed to have always one little window looking out"
1084,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"into life,"" and in the spring she rallied sufficiently to take a few"
1085,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,drives and to sit on the balcony of her apartment. She came back to
1086,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"life with a feverish sort of thirst and avidity. ""No such cure for"
1087,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"pessimism,"" she says, ""as a severe illness; the simplest pleasures are"
1088,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"enough,--to breathe the air and see the sun."""
1089,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1090,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Many plans were made for leaving Paris, but it was finally decided to"
1091,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"risk the ocean voyage and bring her home, and accordingly she sailed"
1092,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"July 23rd, arriving in New York on the last day of that month."
1093,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1094,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"She did not rally after this; and now began her long agony, full of"
1095,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"every kind of suffering, mental and physical. Only her intellect seemed"
1096,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"kindled anew, and none but those who saw her during the last supreme"
1097,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,ordeal can realize that wonderful flash and fire of the spirit before
1098,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"its extinction. Never did she appear so brilliant. Wasted to a shadow,"
1099,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"and between acute attacks of pain, she talked about art, poetry, the"
1100,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"scenes of travel, of which her brain was so full, and the phases of her"
1101,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"own condition, with an eloquence for which even those who knew her best"
1102,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,were quite unprepared. Every faculty seemed sharpened and every sense
1103,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"quickened as the ""strong deliveress"" approached, and the ardent soul was"
1104,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,released from the frame that could no longer contain it.
1105,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1106,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,We cannot restrain a feeling of suddenness and incompleteness and a
1107,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,natural pang of wonder and regret for a life so richly and so vitally
1108,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,endowed thus cut off in its prime. But for us it is not fitting to
1109,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"question or repine, but rather to rejoice in the rare possession that"
1110,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"we hold. What is any life, even the most rounded and complete, but a"
1111,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"fragment and a hint? What Emma Lazarus might have accomplished, had she"
1112,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"been spared, it is idle and even ungrateful to speculate. What she did"
1113,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,accomplish has real and peculiar significance. It is the privilege of
1114,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,a favored few that every fact and circumstance of their individuality
1115,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,shall add lustre and value to what they achieve. To be born a Jewess was
1116,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"a distinction for Emma Lazarus, and she in turn conferred distinction"
1117,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,upon her race. To be born a woman also lends a grace and a subtle
1118,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,magnetism to her influence. Nowhere is there contradiction or
1119,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"incongruity. Her works bear the imprint of her character, and her"
1120,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"character of her works; the same directness and honesty, the same limpid"
1121,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"purity of tone, and the same atmosphere of things refined and beautiful."
1122,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"The vulgar, the false, and the ignoble,--she scarcely comprehended them,"
1123,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,while on every side she was open and ready to take in and respond to
1124,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"whatever can adorn and enrich life. Literature was no mere ""profession"""
1125,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"for her, which shut out other possibilities; it was only a free, wide"
1126,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,horizon and background for culture. She was passionately devoted to
1127,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"music, which inspired some of her best poems; and during the last years"
1128,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"of her life, in hours of intense physical suffering, she found relief"
1129,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and consolation in listening to the strains of Bach and Beethoven. When
1130,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"she went abroad, painting was revealed to her, and she threw herself"
1131,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,with the same ardor and enthusiasm into the study of the great masters;
1132,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,her last work (left unfinished) was a critical analysis of the genius
1133,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and personality of Rembrandt.
1134,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1135,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"And now, at the end, we ask, Has the grave really closed over all these"
1136,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"gifts? Has that eager, passionate striving ceased, and ""is the rest"
1137,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"silence?"""
1138,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,
1139,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,"Who knows? But would we break, if we could, that repose, that silence"
1140,THE BANNER OF THE JEW.,and mystery and peace everlasting?

2091,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"But, swelling like a snow-ball rolled along"
2092,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"By mischief-plotting boys, the rage increased,"
2093,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Grew to a mighty mass, until it reached"
2094,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,The palace of Duke Vladislaw.  He heard
2095,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,With righteous wrath his injured subjects' charge
2096,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Against presumptuous aliens: how these blocked
2097,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"His avenues, his bridges; bared to the sun"
2098,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,The canker-taint of Prague's obscurest coigne;
2099,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Paraded past the churches of the Lord
2100,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"One who denied Him, one by them hailed Christ."
2101,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Enough!  This cloud, no bigger than one's hand,"
2102,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Gains overweening bulk.  Prague harbored, first,"
2103,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Out of contemptuous ruth, a wretched band"
2104,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of outcast paupers, gave them leave to ply"
2105,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Their money-lending trade, and leased them land"
2106,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"On all too facile terms.  Behold! to-day,"
2107,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Like leeches bloated with the people's blood,"
2108,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,They batten on Bohemia's poverty;
2109,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"They breed and grow; like adders, spit back hate"
2110,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,And venomed perfidy for Christian love.
2111,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Thereat the Duke, urged by wise counsellors--"
2112,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Narzerad the statesman (half whose wealth was pledged
2113,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"To the usurers), abetted by the priest,"
2114,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Bishop of Olmutz, who had visited"
2115,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The Holy Sepulchre, whose long, full life"
2116,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Was one clean record of pure piety--
2117,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The Duke, I say, by these persuasive tongues,"
2118,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Coaxed to his darling aim, forbade his guards"
2119,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"To hinder the just anger of his town,"
2120,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,And ordered to be led in chains to him
2121,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,The pilgrim and his host.
2122,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,
2123,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,
2124,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,At noontide meal
2125,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Raschi sat, full of peace, with Jochanan,"
2126,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And the sole daughter of the house, Rebekah,"
2127,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Young, beautiful as her namesake when she brought"
2128,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Her firm, frail pitcher balanced on her neck"
2129,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Unto the well, and gave the stranger drink,"
2130,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,And gave his camels drink.  The servant set
2131,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The sparkling jar's refreshment from his lips,"
2132,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And saw the virgin's face, bright as the moon,"
2133,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Beam from the curled luxuriance of black locks,"
2134,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And cast-back linen veil's soft-folded cloud,"
2135,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Then put the golden ear-ring by her cheek,"
2136,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The bracelets on her hands, his master's pledge,"
2137,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Isaac's betrothal gift, whom she should wed,"
2138,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,And be the mother of millions--one whose seed
2139,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Dwells in the gates of those which hate them.
2140,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,So
2141,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Yearned Raschi to adorn the radiant girl
2142,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Who sat at board before him, nor dared lift"
2143,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Shy, heavy lids from pupils black as grapes"
2144,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,That dart the imprisoned sunshine from their core.
2145,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"But in her ears keen sense was born to catch,"
2146,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And in her heart strange power to hold, each tone"
2147,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"O' the low-keyed, vibrant voice, each syllable"
2148,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"O' the eloquent discourse, enriched with tales"
2149,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of venturous travel, brilliant with fine points"
2150,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of delicate humor, or illustrated"
2151,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"With living portraits of world-famoused men,"
2152,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Jews, Saracens, Crusaders, Islamites,"
2153,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Whose hand he had grasped--the iron warrior,"
2154,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Godfrey of Bouillon, the wise infidel"
2155,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Who in all strength, wit, courtesy excelled"
2156,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,The kings his foes--imperial Saladin.
2157,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,But even as Raschi spake an abrupt noise
2158,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of angry shouts, of battering staves that shook"
2159,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The oaken portal, stopped the enchanted voice,"
2160,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,The uplifted wine spilled from the nerveless hand
2161,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of Rabbi Jochanan.  ""God pity us!"
2162,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Our enemies are upon us once again.
2163,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Hie thee, Rebekah, to the inmost chamber,"
2164,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Far from their wanton eyes' polluting gaze,"
2165,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Their desecrating touch!  Kiss me!  Begone!
2166,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Raschi, my guest, my son""--But no word more"
2167,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Uttered the reverend man.  With one huge crash
2168,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The strong doors split asunder, pouring in"
2169,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"A stream of soldiers, ruffians, armed with pikes,"
2170,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Lances, and clubs--the unchained beast, the mob."
2171,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"""Behold the town's new guest!"" jeered one who tossed"
2172,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,The half-filled golden wine-cup's contents straight
2173,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"In the noble pure young face.  ""What, master Jew!"
2174,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Must your good friends of Prague break bolts and bars
2175,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,To gain a peep at this prodigious pearl
2176,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,You bury in your shell?  Forth to the day!
2177,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Our Duke himself claims share of your new wealth;
2178,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Summons to court the Jew philosopher!"""
2179,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Then, while some stuffed their pokes with baubles snatched"
2180,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"From board and shelf, or with malignant sword"
2181,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Slashed the rich Orient rugs, the pictured woof"
2182,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"That clothed the wall; others had seized and bound,"
2183,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And gagged from speech, the helpless, aged man;"
2184,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Still others outraged, with coarse, violent hands,"
2185,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The marble-pale, rigid as stone, strange youth,"
2186,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Whose eye like struck flint flashed, whose nether lip"
2187,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Was threaded with a scarlet line of blood,"
2188,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Where the compressed teeth fixed it to forced calm.
2189,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"He struggled not while his free limbs were tied,"
2190,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"His beard plucked, torn and spat upon his robe--"
2191,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Seemed scarce to know these insults were for him;
2192,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,But never swerved his gaze from Jochanan.
2193,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Then, in God's language, sealed from these dumb brutes,"
2194,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Swiftly and low he spake: ""Be of good cheer,"
2195,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Reverend old man.  I deign not treat with these.
2196,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"If one dare offer bodily hurt to thee,"
2197,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,By the ineffable Name!  I snap my chains
2198,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Like gossamer, and in his blood, to the hilt,"
2199,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Bathe the prompt knife hid in my girdle's folds.
2200,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The Duke shall hear me.  Patience.  Trust in me."""
2201,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Somewhat the authoritative voice abashed,"
2202,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Even hoarse and changed, the miscreants, who feared"
2203,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Some strong curse lurked in this mysterious tongue,"
2204,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Armed with this evil eye.  But brief the spell.
2205,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"With gibe and scoff they dragged their victims forth,"
2206,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The abused old man, the proud, insulted youth,"
2207,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"O'er the late path of his triumphal march,"
2208,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Befouled with mud, with raiment torn, wild hair"
2209,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And ragged beard, to Vladislaw.  He sat"
2210,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Expectant in his cabinet.  On one side
2211,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"His secular adviser, Narzerad,"
2212,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Quick-eyed, sharp-nosed, red-whiskered as a fox;"
2213,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"On the other hand his spiritual guide,"
2214,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Bishop of Olmutz, unctuous, large, and bland."
2215,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"""So these twain are chief culprits!"" sneered the Duke,"
2216,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Measuring with the noble's ignorant scorn
2217,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"His masters of a lesser caste.  ""Stand forth!"
2218,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Rash, stubborn, vain old man, whose impudence"
2219,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Hath choked the public highways with thy brood
2220,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of nasty vermin, by our sufferance hid"
2221,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"In lanes obscure, who hailed this charlatan"
2222,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"With sky-flung caps, bent knees, and echoing shouts,"
2223,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Due to ourselves alone in Prague; yea, worse,"
2224,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Who offered worship even ourselves disclaim,"
2225,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Our Lord Christ's meed, to this blaspheming Jew--"
2226,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Thy crimes have murdered patience.  Thou hast wrecked
2227,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Thy people's fortune with thy own.  But first
2228,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,(For even in anger we are just) recount
2229,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,With how great compensation from thy store
2230,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Of hoarded gold and jewels thou wilt buy
2231,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Remission of the penalty.  Be wise.
2232,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Hark how my subjects, storming through the streets,"
2233,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Vent on thy tribe accursed their well-based wrath."""
2234,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And, truly, through closed casements roared the noise"
2235,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of mighty surging crowds, derisive cries,"
2236,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,And victims' screams of anguish and affright.
2237,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Then Raschi, royal in his rags, began:"
2238,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"""Hear me, my liege!""  At that commanding voice,"
2239,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The Bishop, who with dazed eyes had perused"
2240,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"The grieved, wise, beautiful, pale face, sprang up,"
2241,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Quick recognition in his glance, warm joy"
2242,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Aflame on his broad cheeks.  ""No more!  No more!"
2243,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,Thou art the man!  Give me the hand to kiss
2244,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,That raised me from the shadow of the grave
2245,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"In Jaffa's lazar-house!  Listen, my liege!"
2246,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,During my pilgrimage to Palestine
2247,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"I, sickened with the plague and nigh to death,"
2248,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Languished 'midst strangers, all my crumbling flesh"
2249,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"One rotten mass of sores, a thing for dogs"
2250,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"To shy from, shunned by Christian as by Turk,"
2251,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"When lo! this clean-breathed, pure-souled, blessed youth,"
2252,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Whom I, not knowing for an infidel,"
2253,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Seeing featured like the Christ, believed a saint,"
2254,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Sat by my pillow, charmed the sting from pain,"
2255,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Quenched the fierce fever's heat, defeated Death;"
2256,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And when I was made whole, had disappeared,"
2257,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"No man knew whither, leaving no more trace"
2258,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Than a re-risen angel.  This is he!"""
2259,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Then Raschi, who had stood erect, nor quailed"
2260,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"From glances of hot hate or crazy wrath,"
2261,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Now sank his eagle gaze, stooped his high head,"
2262,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Veiling his glowing brow, returned the kiss"
2263,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"Of brother-love upon the Christian's hand,"
2264,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"And dropping on his knees implored the three,"

2277,RASCHI IN PRAGUE.,"That were a noble witchcraft simply wrought,"

3431,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3432,NAPHTALI.,Hast seen him yet?

3434,NAPHTALI.,
3435,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3436,BARUCH.,Nay; Rabbi Jacob's door
3437,BARUCH.,"Swung to behind him, just as I puffed up"
3438,BARUCH.,"O'erblown with haste.  See how our years weigh, cousin."
3439,BARUCH.,"Who'd judge me with this paunch a temperate man,"
3440,BARUCH.,"A man of modest means, a man withal"
3441,BARUCH.,"Scarce overpast his prime?  Well, God be praised,"
3442,BARUCH.,If age bring no worse burden!  Who is this stranger?
3443,BARUCH.,Simon the Leech tells me he claims to bear
3444,BARUCH.,Some special message from the Lord--no doubt
3445,BARUCH.,"To-morrow, fresh from rest, he'll publish it"

3450,NAPHTALI.,"To-morrow, man?"

3454,NAPHTALI.,
3455,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3456,BARUCH.,"Rather let's wait,"
3457,BARUCH.,And scrutinize him as he mounts the street.
3458,BARUCH.,"Since you denote him so remarkable,"
3459,BARUCH.,You've whetted my desire.
3460,BARUCH.,
3461,BARUCH.,
3462,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3463,NAPHTALI.,"A blind, old man,"
3464,NAPHTALI.,"Mayhap is all you'll find him--spent with travel,"
3465,NAPHTALI.,"His raiment fouled with dust, his sandaled feet"
3466,NAPHTALI.,Road-bruised by stone and bramble.  But his face!--
3467,NAPHTALI.,"Majestic with long fall of cloud-white beard,"
3468,NAPHTALI.,"And hoary wreath of hair--oh, it is one"
3469,NAPHTALI.,Already kissed by angels.
3470,NAPHTALI.,
3471,NAPHTALI.,
3472,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3473,BARUCH.,"Look, there limps"
3474,BARUCH.,"Little Manasseh, bloated as his purse,"
3475,BARUCH.,And wrinkled as a frost-pinched fruit.  I hear
3476,BARUCH.,His last loan to the Syndic will result
3477,BARUCH.,In quadrupling his wealth.  Good Lord! what luck
3478,BARUCH.,"Blesses some folk, while good men stint and sweat"
3479,BARUCH.,"And scrape, to merely fill the household larder."
3480,BARUCH.,"What said you of this pilgrim, Naphtali?"
3481,BARUCH.,These inequalities of fortune rub
3482,BARUCH.,"My sense of justice so against the grain,"
3483,BARUCH.,I lose my very name.  Whence does he come?
3484,BARUCH.,Is he alone?
3485,BARUCH.,
3486,BARUCH.,
3487,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3488,NAPHTALI.,"He comes from Chinon, France."
3489,NAPHTALI.,Rabbi Cresselin he calls himself--alone
3490,NAPHTALI.,Save for his daughter who has led him hither.
3491,NAPHTALI.,"A beautiful, pale girl with round black eyes."

3493,NAPHTALI.,

3503,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3504,BARUCH.,God have mercy!

3507,BARUCH.,
3508,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3509,NAPHTALI.,No.
3510,NAPHTALI.,"They cleanse their homes and keep their bodies sweet,"
3511,NAPHTALI.,Nor cease from prayer--and so does Jacob's God
3512,NAPHTALI.,"Protect His chosen, still.  Yet even His favor"
3513,NAPHTALI.,Our enemies would twist into a curse.
3514,NAPHTALI.,Beholding the destroying angel smite
3515,NAPHTALI.,The foal idolater and leave unscathed
3516,NAPHTALI.,The gates of Israel--the old cry they raise--
3517,NAPHTALI.,WE have begotten the Black Death--WE poison
3518,NAPHTALI.,The well-springs of the towns.
3519,NAPHTALI.,
3520,NAPHTALI.,
3521,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3522,BARUCH.,God pity us!
3523,BARUCH.,But truly are we blessed in Nordhausen.
3524,BARUCH.,Such terrors seem remote as Egypt's plagues.
3525,BARUCH.,I warrant you our Landgrave dare not harry
3526,BARUCH.,"Such creditors as we.  See, here comes one,"
3527,BARUCH.,The greatest and most liberal of them all--
3528,BARUCH.,Susskind von Orb.
3529,BARUCH.,
3530,BARUCH.,
3531,BARUCH.,"SUSSKIND VON ORB, LIEBHAID, and REUBEN enter, all pass across"
3532,BARUCH.,"the stage, and disappear within the Synagogue."
3533,BARUCH.,
3534,BARUCH.,"I'd barter my whole fortune,"
3535,BARUCH.,"And yours to boot, that's thrice the bulk of mine,"
3536,BARUCH.,For half the bonds he holds in Frederick's name.
3537,BARUCH.,"The richest merchant in Thuringia, he--"
3538,BARUCH.,"The poise of his head would tell it, knew we not."
3539,BARUCH.,How has his daughter leaped to womanhood!
3540,BARUCH.,"I mind when she came toddling by his hand,"
3541,BARUCH.,But yesterday--a flax-haired child--to-day
3542,BARUCH.,Her brow is level with his pompous chin.
3543,BARUCH.,
3544,BARUCH.,
3545,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3546,NAPHTALI.,How fair she is!  Her hair has kept its gold
3547,NAPHTALI.,Untarnished still.  I trace not either parent
3548,NAPHTALI.,"In her face, clean cut as a gem."
3549,NAPHTALI.,
3550,NAPHTALI.,
3551,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3552,BARUCH.,Her mother
3553,BARUCH.,"Was far-off kin to me, and I might pass,"
3554,BARUCH.,"I'm told, unguessed in Christian garb.  I know"
3555,BARUCH.,A pretty secret of that scornful face.
3556,BARUCH.,It lures high game to Nordhausen.
3557,BARUCH.,
3558,BARUCH.,
3559,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3560,NAPHTALI.,"Baruch,"
3561,NAPHTALI.,I marvel at your prompt credulity.
3562,NAPHTALI.,The Prince of Meissen and Liebhaid von Orb!
3563,NAPHTALI.,"A jest for gossips and--Look, look, he comes!"
3564,NAPHTALI.,
3565,NAPHTALI.,
3566,BARUCH.,BARUCH.
3567,BARUCH.,"Who's that, the Prince?"
3568,BARUCH.,
3569,BARUCH.,
3570,NAPHTALI.,NAPHTALI.
3571,NAPHTALI.,"Nay, dullard, the old man,"
3572,NAPHTALI.,"The Rabbi of Chinon.  Ah! his stout staff,"
3573,NAPHTALI.,And that brave creature's strong young hand suffice
3574,NAPHTALI.,Scarcely to keep erect his tottering frame.
3575,NAPHTALI.,"Emaciate-lipped, with cavernous black eyes"
3576,NAPHTALI.,"Whose inward visions do eclipse the day,"
3577,NAPHTALI.,Seems he not one re-risen from the grave
3578,NAPHTALI.,To yield the secret?
3579,NAPHTALI.,
3580,NAPHTALI.,"Enter RABBI JACOB, and RABBI CRESSELIN led by CLAIRE.  They walk"

3596,BARUCH.,My flesh is still a-creep
3597,BARUCH.,From the strange gaze of those wide-rolling orbs.
3598,BARUCH.,"Didst note, man, how they fixed me?  His lean cheeks,"
3599,BARUCH.,"As wan as wax, were bloodless; how his arms"
3600,BARUCH.,Stretched far beyond the flowing sleeve and showed
3601,BARUCH.,"Gaunt, palsied wrists, and hands blue-tipped with death!"
3602,BARUCH.,"Well, I have seen a sage of Israel."

3647,RABBI CRESSELIN.,"The venerable Mar-Isaac in Cologne,"

3664,RABBI CRESSELIN.,"Blistered, refuseth to narrate more woe."
3665,RABBI CRESSELIN.,I have known much sorrow.  When it pleased the Lord

3742,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,Midway between the stars and the abyss.
3743,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"We, by God's grace, have found a special nest"
3744,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"I' the dangerous rock, screened against wind and hawk;"
3745,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Free burghers of a free town, blessed moreover"
3746,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"With the peculiar favor of the Prince,"
3747,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Frederick the Grave, our patron and protector."
3748,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"What shall we fear?  Rather, where shall we seek"
3749,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Secure asylum, if here be not one?"
3750,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Fly?  Our forefathers had the wilderness,"
3751,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"The sea their gateway, and the fire-cored cloud"
3752,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Their divine guide.  Us, hedged by ambushed foes,"
3753,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"No frank, free, kindly desert shall receive."
3754,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Death crouches on all sides, prepared to leap"
3755,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Tiger-like on our throats, when first we step"
3756,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,From this safe covert.  Everywhere the Plague!
3757,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,As nigh as Erfurt it has crawled--the towns
3758,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Reek with miasma, the rank fields of spring,"
3759,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Rain-saturated, are one beautiful--lie,"
3760,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Smiling profuse life, and secreting death."
3761,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Strange how, unbidden, a trivial memory"
3762,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,Thrusts itself on my mind in this grave hour.
3763,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,I saw a large white bull urged through the town
3764,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"To slaughter by a stripling with a goad,"
3765,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Whom but one sure stamp of that solid heel,"
3766,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"One toss of those mooned horns, one battering blow"
3767,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Of that square marble forehead, would have crushed,"
3768,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"As we might crush a worm, yet on he trudged,"
3769,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Patient, in powerful health to death.  At once,"
3770,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"As though o' the sudden stung, he roared aloud,"
3771,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,
3772,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Beat with fierce hoofs the air, shook desperately"
3773,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"His formidable head, and heifer-swift,"
3774,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Raced through scared, screaming streets.  Well, and the end?"
3775,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,He was the promptlier bound and killed and quartered.
3776,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,The world belongs to man; dreams the poor brute
3777,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,Some nook has been apportioned for brute life?
3778,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,Where shall a man escape men's cruelty?

3786,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,As the Ineffable foretold.  I see
3787,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,A flood of fire that streams towards the town.
3788,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Look, the destroying Angel with the sword,"
3789,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Wherefrom the drops of gall are raining down,"
3790,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,"Broad-winged, comes flying towards you.  Now he draws"
3791,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,His lightning-glittering blade!  With the keen edge
3792,SUSSKIND VON ORB.,He smiteth Israel--ah!

5162,PRIOR.,"found my own child lying on her bier, and my wife in fevered frenzy"
5163,PRIOR.,"calling for her babe.  I sought the leech, who counselled me to"
5164,PRIOR.,show the Christian child to the bereaved mother as her own.  The
5165,PRIOR.,"pious trick prevailed; the fever broke, the mother was restored."
5166,PRIOR.,"But never would she part with the child, even when she had learned"
5167,PRIOR.,"to whom it belonged, and until she was gathered with the dead--may"
5168,PRIOR.,peace be with her soul!--she fostered in our Jewish home the
5169,PRIOR.,offspring of the Gentile knight.  Then again would I have yielded
5170,PRIOR.,"the girl to her parent, but Schnetzen was my foe, and I feared the"
5171,PRIOR.,haughty baron would disown the daughter who came from the hands of
5172,PRIOR.,the Jew.  Now however the maiden's temporal happiness demands that
5173,PRIOR.,she be acknowledged by her rightful father.  Let him see what I
5174,PRIOR.,"have written.  As a token, behold this golden cross, bound by the"

8930,MUSE.,With thy voice set free at last.
8931,MUSE.,"While athwart a radiant beam,"
8932,MUSE.,"Like a light, enchanted dream,"
8933,MUSE.,Float the shadows of the past.

8935,MUSE.,
8936,POET.,POET.
8937,POET.,My days of work! sole days whereon I lived!
8938,POET.,O thrice-beloved solitude!
8939,POET.,"Now God be praised, once more I have arrived"
8940,POET.,In this old study bare and rude.
8941,POET.,"These oft-deserted walls, this shabby den,"
8942,POET.,"My faithful lamp, my dusty chair,"
8943,POET.,"My palace, my small world I greet again,"
8944,POET.,"My Muse, immortal, young and fair."
8945,POET.,"Thank God! we twain may sing here side by side,"
8946,POET.,I will reveal to thee my thought.
8947,POET.,"Thou shalt know all, to thee I will confide"
8948,POET.,The evil by a woman wrought.
8949,POET.,"A woman, yes! (mayhap, poor friends, ye guess,"
8950,POET.,Or ever I have said the word!)
8951,POET.,"To such a one my soul was bound, no less"
8952,POET.,Than is the vassal to his lord.
8953,POET.,Detested yoke! within me to destroy
8954,POET.,The vigor and the bloom of youth!
8955,POET.,"Yet only through my love I caught, in sooth,"
8956,POET.,A fleeting glimpse of joy.
8957,POET.,"When by the brook, beneath the evening-star,"
8958,POET.,"On silver sands we twain would stray,"
8959,POET.,The white wraith of the aspen tree afar
8960,POET.,Pointed for us the dusky way.
8961,POET.,Once more within the moonlight do I see
8962,POET.,That fair form sink upon my breast;
8963,POET.,"No more of that!  Alas, I never guessed"
8964,POET.,Whither my fate was leading me.
8965,POET.,"The angry gods some victim craved, I fear,"
8966,POET.,"At that ill-omened time,"
8967,POET.,"Since they have punished me as for a crime,"
8968,POET.,For trying to be happy here!
8969,POET.,
8970,POET.,
8971,MUSE.,MUSE.
8972,MUSE.,A vision of remembered joy
8973,MUSE.,Reveals itself to thee once more;
8974,MUSE.,"Why fearest thou to live it o'er,"
8975,MUSE.,Retracing it without annoy?
8976,MUSE.,"Wouldst thou confide the truth to me,"
8977,MUSE.,And yet those golden days disprove?
8978,MUSE.,"If fate has been unkind to thee,"
8979,MUSE.,"Do thou no less, my friend, than she,"
8980,MUSE.,And smile upon thine early love.
8981,MUSE.,
8982,MUSE.,
8983,POET.,POET.
8984,POET.,Rather I dare to smile upon my woe.
8985,POET.,"Muse, I have said it, I would fain review"
8986,POET.,"My crosses, visions, frenzy,--calmly show"
8987,POET.,"The hour, place, circumstance, in order due."
8988,POET.,"'T was an autumnal evening, I recall,"
8989,POET.,"Chill, gloomy; this one brings it back again."
8990,POET.,The murmuring wind's monotonous rise and fall
8991,POET.,Lulled sombre care within my weary brain.
8992,POET.,"I waited at the casement for my love,"
8993,POET.,"And listening in the darkness black as death,"
8994,POET.,Such melancholy did my spirit move
8995,POET.,That all at once I doubted of her faith.
8996,POET.,"The street wherein I dwelt was lonely, poor,"
8997,POET.,"Lantern in hand, at times, a shade passed by,"
8998,POET.,When the gale whistled through the half-oped door.
8999,POET.,One seemed to hear afar a human sigh.
9000,POET.,"I know not to what omen, sooth to say,"
9001,POET.,My superstitious spirit fell a prey.
9002,POET.,Vainly I summoned courage--coward-like
9003,POET.,I shuddered when the clock began to strike.
9004,POET.,"She did not come!  Alone, with downcast head,"
9005,POET.,I stared at street and walls like one possessed.
9006,POET.,How may I tell the insensate passion bred
9007,POET.,By that inconstant woman in my breast!
9008,POET.,I loved but her in all the world.  One day
9009,POET.,Apart from her seemed worse than death to me.
9010,POET.,Yet I remember how I did essay
9011,POET.,"That cruel night to snap my chain, go free."
9012,POET.,"I named her traitress, serpent, o'er and o'er,"
9013,POET.,"Recalled the anguish suffered for her sake,"
9014,POET.,"Alas! her fatal beauty rose once more,"
9015,POET.,"What grief, what torture in my heart to wake!"
9016,POET.,"At last morn broke; with waiting vain outworn,"
9017,POET.,I fell asleep against the casement there.
9018,POET.,"I oped my lids upon the day new born,"
9019,POET.,My dazzled glance swam in the radiant air.
9020,POET.,"Then on the outer staircase, suddenly,"
9021,POET.,I heard soft steps ascend the narrow flight.
9022,POET.,"Save me, Great God!  I see her--it is she!"
9023,POET.,"Whence com'st thou? speak, where hast thou been this night?"
9024,POET.,What dost thou seek? who brings thee here thus late?
9025,POET.,"Where has this lovely form reclined till day,"
9026,POET.,While I alone must watch and weep and wait?
9027,POET.,"Where, and on whom hast thou been smiling, say!"
9028,POET.,"Out, insolent traitress! canst thou come accurst,"
9029,POET.,And offer to my kiss thy lips' ripe charms?
9030,POET.,What cravest thou?  By what unhallowed thirst
9031,POET.,Darest thou allure me to thy jaded arms?
9032,POET.,"Avaunt, begone! ghost of my mistress dead,"
9033,POET.,Back to thy grave! avoid the morning's beam!
9034,POET.,Be my lost youth no more remembered!
9035,POET.,"And when I think of thee, I'll know it was a dream!"
9036,POET.,
9037,POET.,
9038,MUSE.,MUSE.
9039,MUSE.,"Be calm!  I beg thee, I implore!"
9040,MUSE.,"I shudder, hearing of thy pain."
9041,MUSE.,"O dearest friend, thy wound once more"
9042,MUSE.,Is opening to bleed again.
9043,MUSE.,"Is it so very deep, alas!"
9044,MUSE.,How slowly do the traces pass
9045,MUSE.,"Of this world's troubles!  Thou, my son,"
9046,MUSE.,Forget her! let thy memory shun
9047,MUSE.,"Even to this woman's very name,"
9048,MUSE.,My pitying lips refuse to frame.
9049,MUSE.,
9050,MUSE.,
9051,POET.,POET.
9052,POET.,"Shame upon her, who first"
9053,POET.,Treason and falsehood taught!
9054,POET.,"With grief and wrath accurst,"
9055,POET.,Who set my brain distraught.
9056,POET.,"Shame, woman baleful-eyed,"
9057,POET.,Whose fatal love entombed
9058,POET.,In shadows of thy pride
9059,POET.,My April ere it bloomed.
9060,POET.,"It was thy voice, thy smile,"
9061,POET.,"Thy poisoned glances bright,"
9062,POET.,Which taught me to revile
9063,POET.,The semblance of delight.
9064,POET.,Thy grace of girlish years
9065,POET.,"Murdered my peace, my sleep."
9066,POET.,"If I lose faith in tears,"
9067,POET.,'T is that I saw thee weep.
9068,POET.,I yielded to thy power
9069,POET.,A child's simplicity.
9070,POET.,"As to the dawn the flower,"
9071,POET.,So oped my heart to thee.
9072,POET.,Doubtless this helpless heart
9073,POET.,Was thine without defence.
9074,POET.,Were 't not the better part
9075,POET.,To spare its innocence?
9076,POET.,Shame! thou who didst beget
9077,POET.,"My earliest, youngest woe."
9078,POET.,The tears are streaming yet
9079,POET.,Which first thou madest flow.
9080,POET.,Quenchless this source is found
9081,POET.,Which thou hast first unsealed.
9082,POET.,It issues from a wound
9083,POET.,That never may be healed.
9084,POET.,But in the bitter wave
9085,POET.,"I shall be clean restored,"
9086,POET.,And from my soul shall lave
9087,POET.,Thy memory abhorred!
9088,POET.,
9089,POET.,
9090,MUSE.,MUSE.
9091,MUSE.,"Poet, enough!  Though but one single day"
9092,MUSE.,"Lasted thy dream of her who faithless proved,"
9093,MUSE.,"That day insult not; whatsoe'er thou say,"
9094,MUSE.,"Respect thy love, if thou would be beloved."
9095,MUSE.,If human weakness find the task too great
9096,MUSE.,"Of pardoning the wrongs by others done,"

9099,MUSE.,"The dead lie peaceful in the earth asleep,"
9100,MUSE.,"So our extinguished passions too, should rest."
9101,MUSE.,Dust are those relics also; let us keep
9102,MUSE.,Our hands from violence to their ashes blest.
9103,MUSE.,"Why, in this story of keen pain, my friend,"
9104,MUSE.,Wilt thou refuse naught but a dream to see?
9105,MUSE.,"Does Nature causeless act, to no wise end?"
9106,MUSE.,Think'st thou a heedless God afflicted thee?
9107,MUSE.,Mayhap the blow thou weepest was to save.
9108,MUSE.,"Child, it has oped thy heart to seek relief;"
9109,MUSE.,"Sorrow is lord to man, and man a slave,"
9110,MUSE.,"None knows himself till he has walked with grief,--"
9111,MUSE.,"A cruel law, but none the less supreme,"
9112,MUSE.,"Old as the world, yea, old as destiny."
9113,MUSE.,"Sorrow baptizes us, a fatal scheme;"
9114,MUSE.,All things at this sad price we still must buy.
9115,MUSE.,"The harvest needs the dew to make it ripe,"

9117,MUSE.,"Joy chooses a bruised plant to be her type,"
9118,MUSE.,"That, drenched with rain, still many a blossom bears."
9119,MUSE.,Didst thou not say this folly long had slept?
9120,MUSE.,"Art thou not happy, young, a welcome guest?"
9121,MUSE.,"And those light pleasures that give life its zest,"
9122,MUSE.,How wouldst thou value if thou hadst not wept?
9123,MUSE.,"When, lying in the sunlight on the grass,"
9124,MUSE.,"Freely thou drink'st with some old friend--confess,"
9125,MUSE.,"Wouldst thou so cordially uplift thy glass,"
9126,MUSE.,Hadst thou not weighed the worth of cheerfulness?

9131,MUSE.,"Couldst thou conceive the ineffable peace of heaven,"
9132,MUSE.,"Night's silence, murmurs of the wave that flows,"
9133,MUSE.,If sleeplessness and fever had not driven
9134,MUSE.,Thy thought to yearn for infinite repose?
9135,MUSE.,By a fair woman's love art thou not blest?
9136,MUSE.,"When thou dost hold and clasp her hand in thine,"
9137,MUSE.,"Does not the thought of woes that once possessed,"
9138,MUSE.,Make all the sweeter now her smile divine?
9139,MUSE.,"Wander ye not together, thou and she,"
9140,MUSE.,"Midst blooming woods, on sands like silver bright?"
9141,MUSE.,Does not the white wraith of the aspen-tree
9142,MUSE.,"In that green palace, mark the path at night?"
9143,MUSE.,"And seest thou not, within the moon's pale ray,"
9144,MUSE.,Her lovely form sink on thy breast again?
9145,MUSE.,"If thou shouldst meet with Fortune on thy way,"
9146,MUSE.,"Wouldst thou not follow singing, in her train?"
9147,MUSE.,What hast thou to regret?  Immortal Hope
9148,MUSE.,Is shaped anew in thee by Sorrow's hand.
9149,MUSE.,Why hate experience that enlarged thy scope?
9150,MUSE.,Why curse the pain that made thy soul expand?
9151,MUSE.,"Oh pity her! so false, so fair to see,"
9152,MUSE.,"Who from thine eyes such bitter tears did press,"
9153,MUSE.,"She was a woman.  God revealed to thee,"

9164,MUSE.,
9165,POET.,POET.
9166,POET.,True!  Hate is blasphemy.

9283,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","had been disturbed by philosophic scepticism, for to the day of his"
9284,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",baptism he had observed all the Jewish customs and had only accepted

9286,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",rejecting the pernicious outward shell. He must also discard the theory
9287,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",that the sanguinary persecution of the Jews could have made Paulus
9288,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","despair of the possible continuation of the Jewish race, for only a"
9289,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.","small portion of the Jews dwelt among Christians, while the majority"
9290,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",lived in Asia and enjoyed a certain independence. There remains only
9291,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",the conclusion that Paulus has tested the new dogmas and found
9292,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",them sufficient.... Allorqui therefore begs him to communicate his
9293,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",convictions and vanquish his pupil's doubts concerning Christianity.
9294,"NOTES TO ""EPISTLE"" OF JOSHUA IBN VIVES OF ALLORQUI.",Instead of the general spread of divine doctrine and everlasting peace
