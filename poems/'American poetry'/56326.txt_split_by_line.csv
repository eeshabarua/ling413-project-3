445,I,Without a moon when night comes on
446,I,There is a sighing in its trees
447,I,As of sad lips that no one sees;
448,I,"And the far-dwindling forest, large"
449,I,"Beyond fenced fields, seems shadowy drawn"
450,I,"Into its shadows. Faint and wan,"
451,I,By the wistariaed portico
452,I,"Stealing, I go"
453,I,Through gardens where the weeds are rank:
454,I,"Where, here and there, in clump and bank,"
455,I,"Spiræas rise, whose dotted blooms"
456,I,Seem clustered starlight; and the four
457,I,"Syringas sweet heap, powdered o'er,"
458,I,Thin flower-beakers of perfumes;
459,I,"And the dead flowering-almond tree,"
460,I,"That once was pink as her young cheek,"
461,I,Now withered leans within the glooms.--
462,I,Why must I walk here? seek and seek
463,I,"Her, long since gone?--Still bower on bower"
464,I,The roses climb in blushing flower.--
465,I,"Ah, 'mid the roses could I see"
466,I,"Her eyes, her sad eyes, shine like flowers,"
467,I,Or like the dew that lies for hours
468,I,"Within their hearts, then it might be"
469,I,"I might find comfort here, although"
470,I,"Wistful, as if reproaching me,"
471,I,"Her sad eyes look, saying what none may know."

476,II,When midnight comes it brings a moon:
477,II,A scent is strewn
478,II,Of honey and wild-thorns broadcast
479,II,Beneath the stars. When I have passed
480,II,"Under dark cedars, solemn pines,"
481,II,"Through dodder-drowned petunias,"
482,II,"Corn-flower and the columbine,"
483,II,"To where azaleas, choked with grass,"
484,II,"And peonies, like great wisps, shine,"
485,II,"I reach banked honeysuckle vines,"
486,II,Piled deep and trammeled with the gourd
487,II,And morning-glory--one wild hoard
488,II,"Of rich aroma--where the seat,"
489,II,"The rustic bench, where oft we sat,--"
490,II,"Now warped and old with rain and heat,--"
491,II,Still stands upon its mossy mat:
492,II,And here I rest; and then--a word
493,II,I seem to hear;
494,II,A soft word whispered in my ear;
495,II,Her voice it seems; no thing is near;
496,II,I look around:--I have but heard
497,II,The plaintive note of some lost bird
498,II,"Trickle through night,--awakened where,"
499,II,"'Neath its thick lair of twisted twigs,"
500,II,The jarring and incessant grigs
501,II,"Hum:--dream-drugged so, the haunted air"
502,II,Makes all my soul as heavy as
503,II,Dew-poppied grass.

510,III,"A splash of gold through tangling trees,--"
511,III,Or like the Island beautiful
512,III,"Of Avalon in haunted seas,--"
513,III,There came a sighing in the trees
514,III,"As of sad lips; there was no breeze,"
515,III,And yet sad sighings shook the trees.
516,III,"And when, all in a mystic space,"
517,III,"Her orb swam, amiable white,"
518,III,"Right in that shattered casement, by"
519,III,"The broken porch the creepers lace,"
520,III,"Born of a moonbeam and a sigh,"
521,III,"I saw _her_ face,"
522,III,"Pale through a mist of tears; so slight,"
523,III,"So immaterial, ah me!"
524,III,"In pensiveness, and vanished grace,"
525,III,'Twas like an olden melody.

531,IV,"Where windows face the anxious east,"
532,IV,The moonshine pours
533,IV,"White squares of glitter and, at least,"
534,IV,Gives glimmer to its whispering halls:
535,IV,"Its corridors,"
536,IV,"Sleep-tapestried, are guled with bars"
537,IV,Of moonlight: by its wasted walls
538,IV,"Crouch shadows: and,--where streaked dusts lay"
539,IV,"Their undisturbed, deep gray"
540,IV,"Upon its stairs,--dim, vision-footed, glide"
541,IV,"Faint gossamer gleams, like visible sighs,"
542,IV,"As to and fro, athwart the skies,--"
543,IV,"Wind-swung against the moon outside,--"
544,IV,The twisted branches sway
545,IV,"Of one great tree; I stand below,"
546,IV,"And listen now,"
547,IV,Hearing a murmur come and go
548,IV,Through its gnarled boughs; remembering how
549,IV,"Shady this chestnut made her room,"
550,IV,"And sweet, in June, with plumes of bloom;"
551,IV,And how the broad and gusty flues
552,IV,Of the old house sang when the rain let loose
553,IV,"Its winds, and each flue seemed a hoarse,"
554,IV,"Sonorous throat, filled with the storm's wild boom,"
555,IV,And growled carousal; goblin tunes
556,IV,The hylas pipe to rainy moons
557,IV,"Of March; or, in the afternoons"
558,IV,"Of summer, singing in their course,--"
559,IV,"Where blossoms drip,--all wet of back,--"
560,IV,The crickets drone in avenues
561,IV,Of locusts leading to the gate.
562,IV,And in the dark here where I wait
563,IV,Meseems I hear the silence creep
564,IV,And crepitate
565,IV,From hall to hall; as one in sleep
566,IV,"I hear, yet hear not; feel that there"
567,IV,"Her soul walks, waking on each stair"
568,IV,Strange echoes; and the stealthy crack
569,IV,Of old and warping floors: I seem
570,IV,To follow her; and in a dream
571,IV,"To see, yet see not; in the black"
572,IV,"That drapes each room, my mind informs"
573,IV,"With shapes, that hide behind each door"
574,IV,And fling from closets phantom arms.
575,IV,

577,V,V
578,V,
579,V,"I see her face, as once before,"
580,V,"Bewildered with its terror, pressed"
581,V,"To the dark, polished floor; distressed,"
582,V,Clasped in her blind and covering hands;
583,V,"So desolate with anguish, wrenched"
584,V,"With wild remorse, no man could see,"
585,V,"Could see and turn away like me,"
586,V,No man that sees and understands
587,V,Love and its mortal agony.
588,V,"Again, like some automaton,"
589,V,"Part of that ghostly tragedy,"
590,V,"Myself I see, the fool who fled,"
591,V,Who sneered and fled. And then again
592,V,"Came stealing back. Again, with blenched"
593,V,"And bending face I stand, and clenched"
594,V,"And icy hands, and staring eyes,"
595,V,"Looking upon her face, as wan"
596,V,As water; eyes all wide with pain;
597,V,"Cramped to dilation, packed with loss:"
598,V,Again I seem to lean across
599,V,"The years, and hear my heart's deep groan"
600,V,"Above the young gold of her head,"
601,V,"Above that huddled heap alone,--"
602,V,"Her, white and dead."
603,V,
604,V,
605,VI,VI
606,VI,
607,VI,"Yes, there is moan"
608,VI,Of lamentation and hushed screams
609,VI,In all its crannies; and sad shades
610,VI,"Haunt all its rooms, the moonlight braids,"
611,VI,With melancholy. Slow have flown
612,VI,The weary years: and I have known
613,VI,An anguish and remorse far worse
614,VI,"Than usual life's; and live, it seems,"
615,VI,Because to live is but a curse....
616,VI,
617,VI,
618,VII,VII
619,VII,
620,VII,There she lies buried; there! that ground
621,VII,"Gated with rusty iron, where"
622,VII,She and her stanch forefathers sleep;
623,VII,"So old, the turf scarce shows a mound;"
624,VII,"So gray, you scarce distinguish there"
625,VII,A headstone where the ivies creep
626,VII,And myrtles bloom. A wall of stone
627,VII,Squares it around; a place for dreams;
628,VII,"A mossy spot of sorrow;--lone,"
629,VII,"Nay, lonelier, wilder now it seems,"
630,VII,Though just the same: its roses waste
631,VII,Their petals there as oft of yore;
632,VII,"Their placid petals, as before;"
633,VII,"Pale, pensive petals: yonder some"
634,VII,Lie faint as puffs of foam
635,VII,"Within the moonlight, dimly traced"
636,VII,Beneath the boughs; some few are strown
637,VII,"On the usurping weeds, great grown"
638,VII,"Around her tomb, on which two dead leaves lie...."
639,VII,Here let my sick heart break and die
640,VII,"Amid their wiltings, on her grave,"
641,VII,"Here in her dim, old burying-ground"
642,VII,The druid cedars guard around
643,VII,And roses and wild thorns. Alone
644,VII,"She shall not lie! Ah, let me moan"
645,VII,"My life out here where rose-leaves fall,"
646,VII,And rest by her who was my all!

656,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,With that strange liquid instantly
657,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Might raise them, living red:"
658,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And so he thought, ""'Tis mine at last"

661,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"The dead shall live and love again."""
662,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
663,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,For he had loved one till for him
664,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Her face had grown his spirit-part:
665,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Though dead, she seemed to him less dim"
666,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Than men in street and mart.
667,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"He labored on; for, truth to say,"
668,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"In toil alone his pleasure lay,"
669,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"His art, through which, sometime, he thought,"
670,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Back to his arms she would be brought.
671,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
672,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"He kept such trysts as phantoms keep,"
673,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Pale distances about his soul;
674,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And moved like one who walks asleep,"
675,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Attaining no sure goal:
676,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Yet blither than a younger heart
677,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,At crucible and glass retort
678,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,He labored; for his love was prism
679,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,To irisate toil's egoism.
680,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
681,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"He drained wan draughts from out a cup,"
682,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"A globe of vague and flaming gold,"

684,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"By something white and cold,"
685,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"That wreathed faint fingers round its brim,"
686,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Slim flakes of foam; and, soft and dim,"
687,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Stooped out of fiery-bound abysses
688,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,To print his brow with icy kisses.
689,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
690,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,At last within his trembling hand
691,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"An ancient flask burnt, starry rose;"
692,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"A liquid flame of ruby fanned,"
693,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Heart-like, with crimson throes:"
694,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And in the liquid, like a flower,"
695,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"A starlike face bloomed for an hour,"
696,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Then slowly faded to a skull
697,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,With eyes that mocked the beautiful.
698,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
699,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"'Though all his life had been so strange,"
700,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Yet stranger now it seemed to be;--
701,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,What was it led him forth to range
702,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,'Mid graves and mystery?
703,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"What led him to that one dim tomb,"
704,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Where he could read within the gloom
705,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,The name of one who lay within
706,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"With all of silence, naught of sin?"
707,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
708,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Untainted, so it seemed, and made"
709,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"By death's cold kisses still more fair,"
710,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,He found her; raised her; softly laid
711,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Her raven depths of hair
712,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Upon his shoulder: and the pearls,"
713,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Around her neck and in her curls,"
714,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Less pale were than the kingly calm
715,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Upon his face that showed no qualm.
716,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
717,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And through the night, beneath the moon,"
718,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Across the windy hill, the gloom"
719,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Of forests where the leaves lay strewn,"
720,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,He brought her to his room:
721,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And in the awfulness of death,"
722,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"That filled her wide eyes with its breath,"
723,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,He set her in a carven chair
724,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Where the still moon could kiss her hair.
725,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
726,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,One moment then he paused to think:
727,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Then to her lips, all drawn and dead,"
728,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"His strange elixir pressed and--""Drink!"
729,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Drink life and love!"" he said."
730,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,And it--it drank; the dead drank slow:
731,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,And in its eyes there came a glow:
732,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Yet still as stone its body sate,"
733,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,With eyes of hell and lips of hate.
734,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
735,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Still as fall-frozen ice its face,"
736,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And thin its voice as drizzled rain,"
737,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,When in its rotting silk and lace
738,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,It rose and lived again:
739,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Its bosom moved not while it spake;
740,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Nor moved its lips; and half awake
741,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Its eyes seemed with enchanted sleep
742,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,A century long in night's old keep.
743,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
744,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And, stooping o'er, it whispered low--"
745,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"A sound like a vibrating wire,"
746,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Or like the hiss of falling snow
747,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,In flutterings faint of fire:--
748,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"""In me, behold, you see your toil!"
749,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,In me your love! A thing to coil
750,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Around your life thus!--Make entire!--
751,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"The demon of your dead desire!"""
752,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,
753,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"And where, before, was quietness,"
754,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,Was violence of hate and evil--
755,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Yet all its form seemed passionless,"
756,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,A corpse that held a devil!...
757,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,But who shall say the hands were its
758,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,That made within his throat these pits?--
759,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"They found him dead; and by him, one"
760,THE ELIXIR OF LOVE,"Who clasped him close, a skeleton."

765,GLORAMONE,GLORAMONE
766,GLORAMONE,
767,GLORAMONE,
768,GLORAMONE,The moonbeams on the hollies glow
769,GLORAMONE,Pale where she left me; and the snow
770,GLORAMONE,"Lies bleak in moonshine on the graves,"
771,GLORAMONE,Ribbed with each gust that shakes and waves
772,GLORAMONE,Ancestral cedars by her tomb....
773,GLORAMONE,
774,GLORAMONE,"She lay so beautiful in death,"
775,GLORAMONE,"My Gloramone,--whose loveliness"
776,GLORAMONE,"Death had not dimmed with all its doom,--"
777,GLORAMONE,"That, urged by my divine distress,"
778,GLORAMONE,"I sought her sepulchre: the gloom,"
779,GLORAMONE,"The iciness that takes the breath,"
780,GLORAMONE,"The sense of fear, were not too strong"
781,GLORAMONE,To keep me from beholding long.
782,GLORAMONE,
783,GLORAMONE,"I stole into its sorrow; burst,"
784,GLORAMONE,"With what I know was hand accursed,"
785,GLORAMONE,"Its seal, the gated silence of"
786,GLORAMONE,Her old armorial tomb: but love
787,GLORAMONE,Had sighed sweet romance to my heart;
788,GLORAMONE,"And here, I thought, another part"
789,GLORAMONE,Our souls would play. I did not start
790,GLORAMONE,When indistinctness of pale lips
791,GLORAMONE,Breathed on my hair; faint finger-tips
792,GLORAMONE,Fluttered their starlight on my brow;
793,GLORAMONE,"When on my eyes, I knew not whence,"
794,GLORAMONE,"Vague kisses fell: then, like a vow,"
795,GLORAMONE,"Within my heart, an aching sense"
796,GLORAMONE,Of vampire winning. And I heard
797,GLORAMONE,Her name slow-syllabled--a word
798,GLORAMONE,Of haunting harmony--and then
799,GLORAMONE,"Low-whispered, ""Thou! at last, 'tis thou!"""
800,GLORAMONE,And sighs of shadowy lips again.
801,GLORAMONE,
802,GLORAMONE,How madly strange that this should be!
803,GLORAMONE,"For, had she loved me here on Earth,"
804,GLORAMONE,It had not then been marvelous
805,GLORAMONE,"That she should now remember me,"
806,GLORAMONE,"Returning love for love, though worth"
807,GLORAMONE,"Less, yes, far less to both of us."
808,GLORAMONE,"And so I wondered, listening there:"
809,GLORAMONE,How was it that her soul was brought
810,GLORAMONE,"So near to mine now, whom in life"
811,GLORAMONE,She hated so? And everywhere
812,GLORAMONE,About my life I thought and thought
813,GLORAMONE,And found no reason why her love
814,GLORAMONE,Should now be mine. We were at strife
815,GLORAMONE,Forever here; her hatred drove
816,GLORAMONE,Me to despair: I cast my glove
817,GLORAMONE,"Into the frowning face of fate,"
818,GLORAMONE,"And lost her. Yea, it was her hate"
819,GLORAMONE,That made her Appolonio's wife.
820,GLORAMONE,Her hate! her lovely hate!--for of
821,GLORAMONE,Her naught I found unlovely;--and
822,GLORAMONE,I felt she did not understand
823,GLORAMONE,"My passion, and 'twere well to wait."
824,GLORAMONE,
825,GLORAMONE,"And now I felt her presence near,"
826,GLORAMONE,"I, full of life; yet knew no fear"
827,GLORAMONE,"There in the sombre silence, mark."
828,GLORAMONE,"And it was dark, yes, deadly dark:"
829,GLORAMONE,But when I slowly drew away
830,GLORAMONE,"The pall, death modeled with her face,--"
831,GLORAMONE,From her fair form it fell and lay
832,GLORAMONE,"Rich in the dust,--the shrouded place"
833,GLORAMONE,Was glittering daggered by the spark
834,GLORAMONE,"Of one wild ruby at her throat,"
835,GLORAMONE,Red-arrowed as a star with throbs
836,GLORAMONE,Of pulsing flame. And note on note
837,GLORAMONE,The night seemed filled with tenuous sobs
838,GLORAMONE,"Of fire that flickered from that stone,"
839,GLORAMONE,"That, lustrous, lay against her throat,"
840,GLORAMONE,"Large as her eyes, and shadowy."
841,GLORAMONE,And standing by the dead alone
842,GLORAMONE,I marveled not that this should be.
843,GLORAMONE,"The essence of an hundred stars,"
844,GLORAMONE,"Of fretful crimson, through and through"
845,GLORAMONE,"Its bezels beat, when, bending down"
846,GLORAMONE,"My hot lips pressed her mouth. And scars,"
847,GLORAMONE,"Aurora-scarlet, veiny blue,"
848,GLORAMONE,"Flame-hearted, blurred the midnight; and"
849,GLORAMONE,The vault rang; and I felt a hand
850,GLORAMONE,"Like fire in mine. And, lo, a frown"
851,GLORAMONE,Broke up her face as gently as
852,GLORAMONE,The surface of a fountain's glass
853,GLORAMONE,"A zephyr moves, that jolts the grass"
854,GLORAMONE,"Spilling its rain-drops. When this passed,"
855,GLORAMONE,"Through song-soft slumber, binding fast,"
856,GLORAMONE,Slow smiles dreamed outward beautiful;
857,GLORAMONE,And with each smile I heard the dull
858,GLORAMONE,"Deep music of her heart, and saw,"
859,GLORAMONE,"As by some necromantic law,"
860,GLORAMONE,Faint tremblings of a lubric light
861,GLORAMONE,Flush her white temples and her throat:
862,GLORAMONE,"And each long pulse was as a note,"
863,GLORAMONE,"That, gathering, like a strong surprise"
864,GLORAMONE,"With all of happiness, made sweet"
865,GLORAMONE,With dim carnation in wild wise
866,GLORAMONE,"The arch of her pale lips, and beat"
867,GLORAMONE,Like moonlight from her head to feet.
868,GLORAMONE,I bent and kissed her once again:
869,GLORAMONE,"And with that kiss it seemed that pain,"
870,GLORAMONE,Which long had ached beneath her smile
871,GLORAMONE,"And eyelids, vanished. In a while"
872,GLORAMONE,"I saw she breathed. Then, wondrous white,"
873,GLORAMONE,"Fair as she was before she died,"
874,GLORAMONE,She rose upon the bier; a sight
875,GLORAMONE,"To marvel at, whose truth belied"
876,GLORAMONE,All fiction. Yet I saw her eyes
877,GLORAMONE,"Grow wide unto my kiss,--like skies"
878,GLORAMONE,Of starless dawn.--And all the fire
879,GLORAMONE,Of that dark ruby at her throat
880,GLORAMONE,"Around her presence seemed to float,"
881,GLORAMONE,"A mist of rose, wherein like light"
882,GLORAMONE,"She moved, or music exquisite."
883,GLORAMONE,
884,GLORAMONE,What followed then I scarcely know:
885,GLORAMONE,"All I remember is, I caught"
886,GLORAMONE,Her hand; and from the tomb I brought
887,GLORAMONE,"Her beautiful: and o'er the snow,"
888,GLORAMONE,"Where moonbeams on the hollies glow,"
889,GLORAMONE,I led her. But her feet no print
890,GLORAMONE,"Left of their nakedness, no dint,"
891,GLORAMONE,"No faintest trace in frost. I thought,"
892,GLORAMONE,"""The moonlight fills them with its glow,"
893,GLORAMONE,So soft they fall; or 'tis the snow
894,GLORAMONE,"Covers them o'er!--the tomb was black,"
895,GLORAMONE,"And--this strong light blinds!""--Turning back"
896,GLORAMONE,"My eyes met hers; and as I turned,"
897,GLORAMONE,"Flashing centupled facets, burned"
898,GLORAMONE,That ruby at her throat; and I
899,GLORAMONE,Studied its beauty for a while:
900,GLORAMONE,"How came it there, and when, and why?"
901,GLORAMONE,"Who set it at her throat? Again,"
902,GLORAMONE,"Was it a ruby?--Pondering,"
903,GLORAMONE,"I stood and gazed. A far, strange smile"
904,GLORAMONE,"Filled all her face, and as with pain"
905,GLORAMONE,"I seemed to hear her speak, or sing,"
906,GLORAMONE,"These words, that meant not anything,"
907,GLORAMONE,Yet more than any words may mean:
908,GLORAMONE,"""Thy blood it is,"" she said; then sighed:"
909,GLORAMONE,"""See where thy heart's blood beateth! here"
910,GLORAMONE,"Thy heart's blood, that my lips did drain"
911,GLORAMONE,"In life; I live by still, unseen,"
912,GLORAMONE,Long as thy passion shall remain.--
913,GLORAMONE,Canst thou behold and have no fear?--
914,GLORAMONE,"Yea, if I am not dead, 'tis thou!--"
915,GLORAMONE,Look how thy heart's blood flashes now!--
916,GLORAMONE,"Blood of my life and soul, beat on!"
917,GLORAMONE,Beat on! and fill my veins with dawn;
918,GLORAMONE,"And heat the heart of me, his bride!"""
919,GLORAMONE,"And then she leaned against me, eyed"
920,GLORAMONE,"Like some white serpent, strangely still,"
921,GLORAMONE,"That binds one with its glittering stare,"
922,GLORAMONE,That at wild stars hath gazed until
923,GLORAMONE,Its eyes have learned their golden glare.
924,GLORAMONE,
925,GLORAMONE,And then I took her by the wrists
926,GLORAMONE,And drew her to me. Faintly felt
927,GLORAMONE,"The shadow of her hair, whose mists"
928,GLORAMONE,Were twilight-deep and dimly smelt
929,GLORAMONE,Of shroud and sepulchre. And she
930,GLORAMONE,Smiled on me with such sorcery
931,GLORAMONE,As well might win a soul from God
932,GLORAMONE,To Hell and torments. And I trod
933,GLORAMONE,On white enchantments and was long
934,GLORAMONE,"A song and harp-string to a song,"
935,GLORAMONE,"Love's battle in my blood. And there,"
936,GLORAMONE,"Kissing her mouth, all unaware"
937,GLORAMONE,"The ruby loosened at her throat,"
938,GLORAMONE,"And, ere I wist, hung o'er my hand,"
939,GLORAMONE,And on the brink I seemed to stand
940,GLORAMONE,"Of something that cried out, ""Admire"
941,GLORAMONE,"The beauty of this gem of fire,"
942,GLORAMONE,"Its witchcraft and its workmanship."""
943,GLORAMONE,"Then from her throat it seemed to slip,"
944,GLORAMONE,"And, in the hollow of my hand,"
945,GLORAMONE,"A rosy spasm, a bubble-boat"
946,GLORAMONE,"Of living flame, it seemed to float;"
947,GLORAMONE,"A fretful fire; a heart, fierce fanned"
948,GLORAMONE,"Of red convulsions. Like a brand,"
949,GLORAMONE,"A blaze, it touched me; seemed to run"
950,GLORAMONE,"Like fever through my pulses, swift,"
951,GLORAMONE,"Of torrid poison. One by one,"
952,GLORAMONE,"Now burning ice, now freezing sun,"
953,GLORAMONE,I felt my veins swell. Then I felt
954,GLORAMONE,My palm brim up and overflow
955,GLORAMONE,"With blood that, beads of oozing glow,"
956,GLORAMONE,"Dripped, drop by drop, upon the snow,"
957,GLORAMONE,Like holly-berries on the snow.
958,GLORAMONE,
959,GLORAMONE,Then something darkly seemed to melt
960,GLORAMONE,"Within me, and I heard a sigh"
961,GLORAMONE,"So like a moan, 'twas as if years"
962,GLORAMONE,Of anguish bore it; and the sky
963,GLORAMONE,Swam near me as when seen through tears--
964,GLORAMONE,And she was gone.... In ghostly gloom
965,GLORAMONE,"Of dark, scarred pines a crumbling tomb"
966,GLORAMONE,"Loomed like a mist. Carved in its stone,"
967,GLORAMONE,"Above the grated portal deep,"
968,GLORAMONE,Glimmered this legend:--
969,GLORAMONE,
970,GLORAMONE,"""Let her sleep,"
971,GLORAMONE,"Crowned with dim death, our lovely one,"
972,GLORAMONE,Known here on Earth as Gloramone.
973,GLORAMONE,"Our hearts bow down by her and weep,"
974,GLORAMONE,"And one sits weeping all alone."""

1106,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,
1107,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,"And then I felt a change--a force,"
1108,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,That seemed to seize
1109,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,"My body, like some fearful curse,"
1110,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,"And, fastening, freeze"
1111,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,"It downward, deeper than the knees,"
1112,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,Into the earth--
1113,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,While still among the twisted trees
1114,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,Rang mocking mirth.
1115,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,
1116,THE LEGEND OF THE STONE,"And then I felt such fear, despair,"

1150,THE RUINED MILL,"O'ergrown with creepers, if you should seek,"
1151,THE RUINED MILL,You will find an ancient water-mill
1152,THE RUINED MILL,Of stone below a wooded hill.
1153,THE RUINED MILL,Its weedy wheel is not less still
1154,THE RUINED MILL,Than its image that sleeps in the grassy pool
1155,THE RUINED MILL,"Where the moccasin swims; and, slimly cool"
1156,THE RUINED MILL,"Like streaks of light through blurs of sun,"
1157,THE RUINED MILL,The silver minnows and crawfish run.
1158,THE RUINED MILL,"So lone the place, in its sycamore"
1159,THE RUINED MILL,The blue crane builds; and from the shore
1160,THE RUINED MILL,The shitepoke wanders about its door.
1161,THE RUINED MILL,The burdock sprawls on its sill of pine;
1162,THE RUINED MILL,"And, in its pathway, eglantine"
1163,THE RUINED MILL,And blackberry tangle and intertwine;
1164,THE RUINED MILL,Ox-daisies checker with pearl and gold
1165,THE RUINED MILL,The bushy banks of its mill-race old;
1166,THE RUINED MILL,The owl in its loft as safely lairs
1167,THE RUINED MILL,"As the fox in its cellar, that whelps and cares"
1168,THE RUINED MILL,Naught for the hunters who gallop by
1169,THE RUINED MILL,With their baying hounds; the martins fly
1170,THE RUINED MILL,Around its chimney and build therein;
1171,THE RUINED MILL,"And wasp and hornet, with murmurous din,"
1172,THE RUINED MILL,"Plaster their nests, that none disturb,"
1173,THE RUINED MILL,On window-lintel and hopper-curb.
1174,THE RUINED MILL,
1175,THE RUINED MILL,"Once I stood in this old, stone mill,"
1176,THE RUINED MILL,"Once as the day died over the hill,"
1177,THE RUINED MILL,And night came on; and stark and still
1178,THE RUINED MILL,I met with phantoms upon its stairs;
1179,THE RUINED MILL,"Shadows, that took me unawares,"
1180,THE RUINED MILL,Eyed with fire and cowled with gloom--
1181,THE RUINED MILL,"Twilight phantoms, that crowded, dark,"
1182,THE RUINED MILL,"Its dim interior, each eye a spark"
1183,THE RUINED MILL,"Of sunset, creviced, within the room--"
1184,THE RUINED MILL,"While a moist, chill, moldering, dead perfume"
1185,THE RUINED MILL,"Of crumbling timbers and rotting grain,"
1186,THE RUINED MILL,"On floors all warped with the sun and rain,"
1187,THE RUINED MILL,"Made of the stagnant air a cell,"
1188,THE RUINED MILL,Round the cobwebbed rafters hung like a spell;
1189,THE RUINED MILL,"Making my mind, despite me, run"
1190,THE RUINED MILL,"On thoughts of a hidden skeleton,"
1191,THE RUINED MILL,"There in the walls; or, dripping dank,"
1192,THE RUINED MILL,"Under the floor, 'neath a certain plank;"
1193,THE RUINED MILL,"Glowering, grim in the mossy wet,"
1194,THE RUINED MILL,In its hollow eyes a dark regret.
1195,THE RUINED MILL,I had entered when the evening-star
1196,THE RUINED MILL,"In the saffron heaven was sparkling afar,"
1197,THE RUINED MILL,"In all its glory of light divine,"
1198,THE RUINED MILL,Like a diamond drowned in kingly wine;
1199,THE RUINED MILL,"And I stayed till the heavens hung low and gray,"
1200,THE RUINED MILL,"And the clouds of the storm drove down and away,"
1201,THE RUINED MILL,Like the tattered leaves of an Autumn day;
1202,THE RUINED MILL,And the wild rain beat on the rotting roof
1203,THE RUINED MILL,"The goblin dance of the Fiend's own hoof,"
1204,THE RUINED MILL,Till the spider dropped from its dusty woof;
1205,THE RUINED MILL,And the thunder throbbed like a mighty heart;
1206,THE RUINED MILL,And the wild wind filled each crannied part
1207,THE RUINED MILL,"Of the mill with moanings, that seemed to be"
1208,THE RUINED MILL,The voice of an ancient agony--
1209,THE RUINED MILL,Till the beetle shrunk in its board of pine;--
1210,THE RUINED MILL,While the lightning lit with its instant shine
1211,THE RUINED MILL,The tossing terror of tree and vine ...
1212,THE RUINED MILL,"Then, all on a sudden, the storm was still--"
1213,THE RUINED MILL,"And I saw _her_ there, near the shattered sill,"
1214,THE RUINED MILL,"At the window, gazing from the mill"
1215,THE RUINED MILL,Into the darkness under the storm;
1216,THE RUINED MILL,Around her flickering hair and form
1217,THE RUINED MILL,Unearthly glimmer. She seemed to lean
1218,THE RUINED MILL,To the rushing waters that roared unseen:
1219,THE RUINED MILL,A moment only she seemed to sway
1220,THE RUINED MILL,"Before me there in the lightning gray,"
1221,THE RUINED MILL,Then vanished utterly away:
1222,THE RUINED MILL,Like a blown-out light....
1223,THE RUINED MILL,
1224,THE RUINED MILL,"And was it she,"
1225,THE RUINED MILL,"The miller's daughter who died, they say,"
1226,THE RUINED MILL,"Who flung herself on the mill's great wheel,"
1227,THE RUINED MILL,"Long years ago, in her heart's despair?--"
1228,THE RUINED MILL,"Or was it a dream, a fantasy,"
1229,THE RUINED MILL,"That the place and the moment made me feel,"

1519,II,Flowers.--Hers some influence
1520,II,"Of soft, serpent magnetism,"
1521,II,Vanquishing my every sense
1522,II,With essential mesmerism;
1523,II,Holding me beneath the lens
1524,II,Of her will's compelling prism.
1525,II,
1526,II,
1527,III,III
1528,III,
1529,III,I can not escape. She treads
1530,III,Noiseless as the forest flowers
1531,III,Walked on by the wind; their heads
1532,III,Pavements for the mottled hours:
1533,III,She is whiter than the trees
1534,III,When their blossoms are unsheathing;
1535,III,She is lissome as the ease
1536,III,Of the lilied water wreathing;
1537,III,She is subtle as the breeze
1538,III,Through the summer foliage breathing.
1539,III,

1541,IV,IV
1542,IV,
1543,IV,"When she speaks, within my ears,"
1544,IV,Like wild music heard in fever
1545,IV,Is her voice; and it appears
1546,IV,That my soul can never leave her:
1547,IV,"Babylonian necromance,"
1548,IV,"Oldest witcheries,--that harrow"
1549,IV,"Yet compel,--are hers; her glance"
1550,IV,Holds me; and my very marrow
1551,IV,"Feels it; and I stand a-trance,"
1552,IV,While her pupils slowly narrow.
1553,IV,
1554,IV,
1555,V,V
1556,V,
1557,V,"Thus she binds me with her gaze,"
1558,V,While her white hands weigh my shoulders;
1559,V,And my weak will swings and sways
1560,V,To her gaze that burns and smolders.
1561,V,"So she draws me far away,"
1562,V,Under boughs where summer dallies:
1563,V,Over peaks of purple day:
1564,V,Far away through Eden alleys:
1565,V,All the way is one long May
1566,V,Till we come to her dark valleys.
1567,V,
1568,V,
1569,VI,VI
1570,VI,
1571,VI,There black tempest treads the peaks;
1572,VI,"Iron skies are gulfed asunder,"
1573,VI,"Whence the lightning's lava leaks,"
1574,VI,Vomiting the hosts of thunder.
1575,VI,Here she kisses me till red
1576,VI,With my heart's blood are her kisses;
1577,VI,"Then my soul is seized with dread,"
1578,VI,For it knows no woman this is:
1579,VI,"Yea, behold! it sees instead"
1580,VI,But a milk-white snake that hisses.

1644,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,
1645,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,Then sat and talked to the forest flowers

1647,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,
1648,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,"And stared and whispered and smiled and wept,"

1678,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,And the strix-owl called; and the werewolf snarled;

1689,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,
1690,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,"And wrapped in his mantle of wind and cloud,"
1691,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,The storm-fiend stalked through the forest loud.
1692,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,
1693,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,When she heard the dead man rattle and groan
1694,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,"As the oak was bent and its leaves were blown,"
1695,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,
1696,ROMAUNT OF THE OAK,"And the lightning flickered his shimmering mail,--"

1719,I,Not for you and me the path
1720,I,Winding through the shadowless

1722,I,Where the brook that hurries hath
1723,I,Laughter lighter than a boy's;
1724,I,"Where recurrent odors poise,"
1725,I,"Romp-like, with irreverent tresses,"
1726,I,In the sun; and leaves and boughs
1727,I,Build a music-haunted house
1728,I,"For the winds to hang their dresses,"
1729,I,"Whisper-silken, rustling in."
1730,I,Ours a path that led unto

1733,I,Over acres sisterless
1734,I,Of all healthy beauty; where
1735,I,Fungus growths made sad the air
1736,I,As a phantom-felt caress:
1737,I,"Under darkness and strange stars,"
1738,I,To the sorrow-silenced bars
1739,I,"Of a dubious forestland,"

1742,I,Clad like Sleep's own servitors
1743,I,In the shadowy livery
1744,I,"Of the ancient House of Dreams,"
1745,I,"Which before us,--fitfully,"
1746,I,With white intermittent gleams
1747,I,"Of its pale-lamped windows,--shone,"
1748,I,Echoing with the dim unknown.

1751,II,II
1752,II,
1753,II,"To say to Hope,--Take all from me,"

1758,II,Is all I crave.
1759,II,
1760,II,"To say to Time,--Be true to me,"
1761,II,Nor grant me less

1769,III,
1770,III,I came to you when eve was young:
1771,III,"And, where the park rolled downward to"
1772,III,"The river, and among the dew,"
1773,III,"One vesper moment, lit and sung"
1774,III,"A bird, your eyes said something true,"
1775,III,"Said something to my eyes, more dear"
1776,III,"Than song the bird poured, silver-clear."
1777,III,How sweet it was to be with you!
1778,III,"How, with our souls, we seemed to hear"
1779,III,The night approaching with its stars!
1780,III,How calm the moon sloped up her sphere
1781,III,Of fire-filled pearl through passive bars
1782,III,Of clouds that berged the tender east!
1783,III,While all the dark inanimate
1784,III,Of Nature woke; initiate
1785,III,"With th' moon's arrival, something ceased"
1786,III,In Nature's soul: she stood again
1787,III,"Another self, that seemed t' have been"
1788,III,"Dormant, suppressed and so unseen"
1789,III,"All day: a life, unknown and strange"
1790,III,"And dream-suggestive, that had lain,--"
1791,III,"Masked on with light,--within the range"
1792,III,"Of thought, but unrevealed till now."
1793,III,"It was the hour of love. And you,"
1794,III,"With downward eyes and pensive brow,"
1795,III,"Among the moonlight and the dew,--"
1796,III,"Although no word of love was spoken,--"
1797,III,Heard the sweet night's confession broken
1798,III,Of something here more sweet in me:
1799,III,"A love, depth made inaudible,"
1800,III,"Save to your soul, that answered well,"
1801,III,With eyes replying silently.

1805,IV,
1806,IV,"Fair you are as a rose is fair,"
1807,IV,There where the shadows dew it;

1809,IV,Soft as the cloud that lingers there
1810,IV,With the sunset's auburn through it.
1811,IV,"Eyes of azure and throat of snow,"
1812,IV,Tell me what my heart would know!
1813,IV,
1814,IV,Every dream I dream of you
1815,IV,"Has a love-thought in it,"
1816,IV,"And a hope, a kiss or two,"
1817,IV,"Something dear and something true,"
1818,IV,"Telling me each minute,"
1819,IV,With three words it whispers clear
1820,IV,What my heart from you would hear.

1824,V,
1825,V,Junetime came: the days grew kind
1826,V,With increasing beauty: deep
1827,V,Were the nights with rest and sleep:
1828,V,"Fair, with poppies intertwined"
1829,V,"On their blond locks, went the Hours,"
1830,V,"Sunny-hearted as the rose,"
1831,V,"Through the buds and banded flowers,"
1832,V,"Teaching them, how no one knows,"
1833,V,"Freshness, color, and perfume.--"
1834,V,In the window of your room
1835,V,Bloomed a late azalea. Pink
1836,V,As an egret's rosy plumes
1837,V,Shone its tender-tufted blooms.
1838,V,"From your care and love, I think,"
1839,V,"Love's rose-color it did drink,"
1840,V,Growing rosier day by day
1841,V,Through your 'tending hand's caress:
1842,V,And your own dear naturalness
1843,V,Had imbued it in some way.
1844,V,"Once you gave a blossom of it,"
1845,V,"Smiling, to me when I left:"
1846,V,Need I tell you how I love it
1847,V,Faded though it is now!--'Reft
1848,V,"Of its fragrance and its color,"
1849,V,"Yet 'tis dearer now than then,--As"
1850,V,past happiness is when
1851,V,"Life regrets.--And dimmer, duller"
1852,V,"Though its beauty be, when I"
1853,V,"Look upon it, I recall"
1854,V,Every part of that old wall;
1855,V,"And the dingy window high,"
1856,V,Where you sat and read; and all
1857,V,The fond love that made your face
1858,V,A soft sunbeam in that place:
1859,V,And the plant that grew this bloom
1860,V,"Withered here, itself long dead,"
1861,V,Makes a halo overhead
1862,V,"There again--and through my room,"
1863,V,"Like faint whispers of perfume,"
1864,V,Steal the words of love then said.

1866,V,
1867,VI,VI
1868,VI,
1869,VI,"All of my love I send to you,"

1872,VI,"Out of my heart's glad garden,"
1873,VI,"O'er which, its lovely warden,"
1874,VI,"Your face, a lily seeming,"
1875,VI,Is dreaming.
1876,VI,
1877,VI,"All of my life I bring to you,"
1878,VI,"I bring to you,"
1879,VI,"In deeds, like birds, that wing to you"
1880,VI,"Out of my soul's deep valley,"
1881,VI,"O'er which, most musically,"
1882,VI,"Your love, a fountain, glistens,"
1883,VI,And listens.
1884,VI,
1885,VI,"My love, my life, how blessed in you!"
1886,VI,How blessed in you!
1887,VI,"Whose thoughts, whose deeds find rest in you"
1888,VI,"Here on my life's dark ocean,"
1889,VI,"O'er which, in heavenly motion,"
1890,VI,"Your soul, a star, abideth,"
1891,VI,And guideth.
1892,VI,
1893,VI,
1894,VII,VII
1895,VII,
1896,VII,Where the old Kentucky wound
1897,VII,"Through the land,--its stream between"
1898,VII,"Hills of primitive forest green,--"
1899,VII,Like a goodly belt around
1900,VII,Giant breasts of grandeur; with
1901,VII,"Many an unknown Indian myth,"
1902,VII,On the boat we steamed. The land
1903,VII,Like an hospitable hand
1904,VII,Welcomed us. Alone we sat
1905,VII,"On the under-deck, and saw"
1906,VII,Farm-house and plantation draw
1907,VII,Near and vanish. 'Neath your hat
1908,VII,"Your young eyes laughed; and your hair,"
1909,VII,Blown about them by the air
1910,VII,"Of our passage, clung and curled."
1911,VII,"Music, and the summer moon;"
1912,VII,And the hills' great shadows hewn
1913,VII,Out of silence; and the tune
1914,VII,"Of the whistle, when we whirled"
1915,VII,Round a moonlit bend in sight of
1916,VII,Some lone landing heaped with hay
1917,VII,Or tobacco; where the light of
1918,VII,"One dim, solitary lamp"
1919,VII,Signaled through the evening's damp:
1920,VII,"Then a bell; and, dusky gray,"
1921,VII,Shuffling figures on the shore
1922,VII,With the cable; rugged forms
1923,VII,On the gang-plank; backs and arms
1924,VII,With their cargo bending o'er;
1925,VII,And the burly mate before.
1926,VII,"Then an iron bell, and puff"
1927,VII,Of escaping steam; and out
1928,VII,Where the stream is wheel-whipped rough;
1929,VII,"Music, and a parting shout"
1930,VII,From the shore; the pilot's bell
1931,VII,Beating on the deck below;
1932,VII,"Then the steady, quivering, slow,"
1933,VII,Smooth advance again. Until
1934,VII,Twinkling lights beyond us tell
1935,VII,Of a lock or little town
1936,VII,"Clasped between a hill and hill,"
1937,VII,Where the bluegrass fields slope down.--
1938,VII,So we went. That summer-time
1939,VII,Lingers with me like a rhyme
1940,VII,Learned for dreamy beauty of
1941,VII,"Its old-fashioned faith and love,"
1942,VII,In some musing moment; sith
1943,VII,Heart-associated with
1944,VII,"Joy that moments quiet bore,"
1945,VII,And forgotten nevermore.

1949,VIII,
1950,VIII,Three sweet things love lives upon:
1951,VIII,"Music, at whose fountain's brink"
1952,VIII,Low he stoops his face to drink;
1953,VIII,"Seeing, as the wave is drawn,"
1954,VIII,His near image rise and sink.
1955,VIII,Three sweet things love lives upon.
1956,VIII,
1957,VIII,Three sweet things love lives upon:
1958,VIII,"Odor, whose red roses wreathe"
1959,VIII,His bright brow that shines beneath;
1960,VIII,"Hearing, as each bloom is blown,"
1961,VIII,His soul's essence breathe and breathe.
1962,VIII,Three sweet things love lives upon.
1963,VIII,
1964,VIII,Three sweet things love lives upon:
1965,VIII,"Color, to whose rainbow he"
1966,VIII,Lifts his dark eyes burningly;
1967,VIII,"Feeling, as the wild hues dawn,"
1968,VIII,His high immortality.
1969,VIII,Three sweet things love lives upon.

1972,IX,IX
1973,IX,
1974,IX,"Memories of other days,--"
1975,IX,"Sad with whilom happiness,--"
1976,IX,Rise before my musing gaze
1977,IX,In the twilight.... And your dress
1978,IX,"Seems beside me, like a haze"
1979,IX,Shimmering white; as when we went
1980,IX,"'Neath the star-strewn firmament,"
1981,IX,"Love-led, with impatient feet"
1982,IX,"Down the night that, summer-sweet,"
1983,IX,Sparkled o'er the lamp-lit street.
1984,IX,Every look you gave me then
1985,IX,"Comes before my eyes again,"
1986,IX,Making music for my heart
1987,IX,On that path where once for us
1988,IX,"Roses, red and amorous,"
1989,IX,"Grew, the roses red of love:"
1990,IX,"Roses, that are dead enough"
1991,IX,On that path now! whence oft start
1992,IX,"Out of recollected places,"
1993,IX,"With remembered forms and faces,"
1994,IX,"Dreams of love, like figures, woven"
1995,IX,"In my life's dark tapestry,"
1996,IX,"Beckoning, ever shadowy,"
1997,IX,To my soul still.--O'er the cloven
1998,IX,Gulf of time I seem to hear
1999,IX,"Words once whispered in my ear,"
2000,IX,"Calling--as might friends long dead,"
2001,IX,"With familiar voices deep,"
2002,IX,"Call to one who lies asleep,"
2003,IX,Comforting.--So was I led
2004,IX,"Backward to forgotten things,"
2005,IX,Contiguities that spread
2006,IX,"Sudden, unremembered wings:"
2007,IX,"And across my mind's still blue,"
2008,IX,"From the nest they fledged in, flew"
2009,IX,Dazzling shapes that passion knew.
2010,IX,
2011,IX,
2012,X,X
2013,X,
2014,X,Ah! over full my heart is
2015,X,Of sadness and of pain:
2016,X,As a rose-flower in the garden
2017,X,The dull dusk fills with rain;
2018,X,As a blown red rose that shivers
2019,X,And bows to the wind and rain.
2020,X,
2021,X,So give me your hands and speak me
2022,X,"As once in the days of yore,"
2023,X,"When love spoke sweetly to us,"
2024,X,The love that speaks no more:
2025,X,The sound of your voice may help him
2026,X,To speak in my heart once more.
2027,X,
2028,X,"Ah! over grieved my soul is,"
2029,X,"And tired and sick for sleep,"
2030,X,"As a poppy-bloom that withers,"
2031,X,"Forgotten, where reapers reap:"
2032,X,As a harvested poppy-flower
2033,X,That dies where reapers reap.
2034,X,
2035,X,So bend to my face and kiss me
2036,X,"As once in the days of yore,"
2037,X,When the touch of your lips was magic
2038,X,That restored to life once more:
2039,X,"The thought of your kiss, which awakens"
2040,X,To life that love once more.
2041,X,
2042,X,
2043,XI,XI
2044,XI,
2045,XI,"Sitting often I have, oh!"
2046,XI,Often have desired you so--
2047,XI,Yearned to kiss you as I did
2048,XI,"When your love to me you gave,"
2049,XI,"In the moonlight, by the wave,"
2050,XI,And a long-remembered kiss
2051,XI,"Pressed upon your mouth that chid,"
2052,XI,Then upon each eye's sweet lid--
2053,XI,"That, all passion-shaken, I"
2054,XI,With love-language will address
2055,XI,"Each dear thing I know you by,"
2056,XI,"Picture, needle-work, or frame;"
2057,XI,Each suggestive in the same
2058,XI,Perfume of past happiness:
2059,XI,"Till, meseems, the ways we knew"
2060,XI,Now again I tread with you
2061,XI,From the old-time tryst: and there
2062,XI,Feel the pressure of your hair
2063,XI,"Cool and young upon my cheek,"
2064,XI,And your breath's aroma: bare
2065,XI,"On my arm your hand,--as weak"
2066,XI,As a lily on a stream:--
2067,XI,And once more you look at me
2068,XI,"With the sometime witchery,"
2069,XI,And again I hear you speak;
2070,XI,And remembered ecstasy
2071,XI,Sweeps my soul again.--I seem
2072,XI,Dreaming.... Would I thus might dream
2073,XI,Ever! and reality
2074,XI,Mix itself eternally
2075,XI,"With such visions of the past,"
2076,XI,Where my soul still holds you fast!
2077,XI,
2078,XI,
2079,XII,XII
2080,XII,
2081,XII,"When day dies, lone, forsaken,"
2082,XII,And joy is kissed asleep;
2083,XII,"When doubt's gray eyes awaken,"
2084,XII,"And love, with music taken"
2085,XII,"From hearts with sighings shaken,"
2086,XII,Sits in the dusk to weep:
2087,XII,
2088,XII,With ghostly-lifted finger
2089,XII,What memory then shall rise?
2090,XII,Of dark regret the bringer--
2091,XII,To tell the sorrowing singer
2092,XII,"Of days whose echoes linger,"
2093,XII,Till dawn unstars the skies.
2094,XII,
2095,XII,"When night is gone and, beaming,"
2096,XII,Faith journeys forth to toil;
2097,XII,"When hope's blue eyes wake gleaming,"
2098,XII,And life is done with dreaming
2099,XII,The dreams that seem but seeming
2100,XII,Within the world's turmoil:
2101,XII,
2102,XII,Who may forget the presence
2103,XII,Of death that walks unseen?
2104,XII,Whose scythe casts shadowy crescents
2105,XII,"Around life's glittering essence,"
2106,XII,"As lessens, slowly lessens,"
2107,XII,The space that lies between.
2108,XII,
2109,XII,
2110,XIII,XIII
2111,XIII,
2112,XIII,"Bland was that October day,"
2113,XIII,"Calm and balmy as the spring,"
2114,XIII,"When we went a forest way,"
2115,XIII,"Under beeches, lichen-gray,"
2116,XIII,To a valleyed opening;
2117,XIII,"Where the purple aster flowered,"
2118,XIII,"And, like torches, savage-held,"
2119,XIII,Red the fiery sumac towered;
2120,XIII,"And, where gum-trees sentineled"
2121,XIII,"Vistas, robed in gold and garnet,"
2122,XIII,Ripe the thorny chestnut shelled
2123,XIII,Its brown plumpness. Bee and hornet
2124,XIII,"Droned around us; low the cricket,"
2125,XIII,"Tireless in the wood-rose thicket,"
2126,XIII,"Tremoloed; and, to the wind"
2127,XIII,"All its moon-spun silver casting,"
2128,XIII,"Swung the milkweed's pod, that thinned,"
2129,XIII,Where a butterfly seemed pinned:
2130,XIII,And its clean flame on the sod
2131,XIII,"By the fading goldenrod,"
2132,XIII,Burned the white life-everlasting.--
2133,XIII,"It was not so much the time,"
2134,XIII,"Nor the place, nor way we went,"
2135,XIII,"That made all our moods to rhyme,"
2136,XIII,"Nor the season's sentiment,"
2137,XIII,As it was the innocent
2138,XIII,"Carefree childhood of our hearts,"
2139,XIII,Reading each expression of
2140,XIII,Death and change as life and love:
2141,XIII,That impression joy imparts
2142,XIII,Unto others and retorts
2143,XIII,"On itself, which then made glad"
2144,XIII,"All the sorrow of decay,"
2145,XIII,As the memory of that day
2146,XIII,Makes this day of autumn sad.
2147,XIII,
2148,XIII,
2149,XIV,XIV
2150,XIV,
2151,XIV,The pungent-breathed petunias
2152,XIV,Hang riven of the rain;
2153,XIV,And where the tiger-lily was
2154,XIV,Now droops a tawny stain;
2155,XIV,While in the twilight's purple pause
2156,XIV,Earth dreams of heaven again.
2157,XIV,
2158,XIV,"When love sits down to sigh,"
2159,XIV,Where one lies all alone
2160,XIV,Beneath the sod's green sky--
2161,XIV,"What boots it then to try,"
2162,XIV,Or to atone?
2163,XIV,
2164,XIV,With ragged petals round its pod
2165,XIV,The rain-wrecked poppy dies;
2166,XIV,And where the hectic rose did nod
2167,XIV,A crumbled crimson lies;
2168,XIV,While distant as the dreams of God
2169,XIV,The stars slip in the skies.
2170,XIV,
2171,XIV,"When love lies down to sleep,"
2172,XIV,When one is dead and gone--
2173,XIV,Within the darkness deep
2174,XIV,What boots it then to weep?
2175,XIV,All's said and done.
2176,XIV,
2177,XIV,
2178,XV,XV
2179,XV,
2180,XV,"Holding both your hands in mine,"
2181,XV,"Often have we sat together,"
2182,XV,"While, outside, the boisterous weather"
2183,XV,Hung the wild wind on the pine
2184,XV,"Like a black marauder, and"
2185,XV,With a sudden warning hand
2186,XV,At the casement rapped. The night
2187,XV,"Wrote no line or glimmer of light,"
2188,XV,"Starbeam-syllabled, within"
2189,XV,"Her dark book of death and sin,"
2190,XV,Cloudy-chaptered tragicly.--
2191,XV,"Looking in your eyes, ah me!"
2192,XV,"Though I knew, I did not heed"
2193,XV,"What the night wrote there for us,"
2194,XV,Threatening and ominous:
2195,XV,For love helped my heart to read
2196,XV,Forward to unopened pages
2197,XV,"Of a coming day, that held"
2198,XV,More for us than all the ages
2199,XV,"Past, that it epitomized"
2200,XV,In one sentence; where was spelled
2201,XV,What our present realized
2202,XV,Only--all the love that was
2203,XV,Past and still to be for us.
2204,XV,
2205,XV,
2206,XVI,XVI
2207,XVI,
2208,XVI,"'Though in the garden, gray with dew,"
2209,XVI,"All life lies withering,"
2210,XVI,"And there's no more to say or do,"
2211,XVI,"No more to sigh or sing,"
2212,XVI,Come back with me the ways we knew
2213,XVI,When buds were opening.
2214,XVI,
2215,XVI,Perhaps we shall not search in vain
2216,XVI,Within its wreck and gloom;
2217,XVI,'Mid roses ruined of the rain
2218,XVI,There still may live one bloom;
2219,XVI,"One flower, whose heart may still retain"
2220,XVI,The long-lost soul-perfume.
2221,XVI,
2222,XVI,"And then, perhaps, will come to us"
2223,XVI,The dreams we dreamed of yore;
2224,XVI,"And song, who spoke so beauteous,"
2225,XVI,Will speak to us once more;
2226,XVI,"And love, with eyes all amorous,"
2227,XVI,Will gaze as once before.
2228,XVI,
2229,XVI,"So 'though the yard is gray with dew,"
2230,XVI,"And flowers are withering,"
2231,XVI,"And there's no more to say or do,"
2232,XVI,"No more to sigh or sing,"
2233,XVI,Come back with me the ways we knew
2234,XVI,When buds were opening.
2235,XVI,
2236,XVI,
2237,XVII,XVII
2238,XVII,
2239,XVII,"Looking on the desolate street,"
2240,XVII,"Where the first snow drifts and drives,"
2241,XVII,"Trodden black of hurrying feet,"
2242,XVII,Where the athlete storm-wind strives
2243,XVII,"With each tree and dangling light,--"
2244,XVII,"Centres, sphered with glittering white,--"
2245,XVII,Hissing in the dancing snow ...
2246,XVII,Backward in my mind I go
2247,XVII,To that tempest-haunted night
2248,XVII,"Of two autumns past, when we,"
2249,XVII,"Hastening homeward, were o'ertaken"
2250,XVII,"Of the storm; and 'neath a tree,"
2251,XVII,"With its wild leaves tempest-shaken,"
2252,XVII,"Sheltered us in that forsaken,"
2253,XVII,"Sad and ancient cemetery,--"
2254,XVII,Where folk came no more to bury.--
2255,XVII,"Haggard gravestones, mossed and crumbled,"
2256,XVII,"Tottered round us, or o'ertumbled"
2257,XVII,"In their sunken graves; and some,"
2258,XVII,Urned and obelisked above
2259,XVII,"Iron-fenced-in tombs, stood dumb"
2260,XVII,Records of forgotten love.
2261,XVII,And again I see the west
2262,XVII,Yawning inward to its core
2263,XVII,"Of electric-spasmed ore,"
2264,XVII,"Swiftly, without pause or rest:"
2265,XVII,And a great wind sweeps the dust
2266,XVII,"Up abandoned sidewalks; and,"
2267,XVII,"In the rotting trees, the gust"
2268,XVII,Shouts again--a voice that would
2269,XVII,Make its gaunt self understood
2270,XVII,Moaning over Death's lean land.--
2271,XVII,"And we sat there, hand in hand;"
2272,XVII,"On the granite; where we read,"
2273,XVII,"By the instant skies o'erhead,"
2274,XVII,Something of one young and dead.
2275,XVII,Yet the words begot no fear
2276,XVII,In our souls: you leaned your cheek
2277,XVII,Smiling on mine: very near
2278,XVII,Were our lips: we did not speak.
2279,XVII,
2280,XVII,
2281,XVIII,XVIII
2282,XVIII,
2283,XVIII,And suddenly alone I stood
2284,XVIII,"With scared eyes gazing through the wood,"
2285,XVIII,For some still sign of ill or good
2286,XVIII,To lead me from the solitude.
2287,XVIII,
2288,XVIII,The day was at its twilighting;
2289,XVIII,One cloud o'erhead spread a vast wing
2290,XVIII,Of rosy thunder; vanishing
2291,XVIII,Behind the far hills' sullen ring.
2292,XVIII,
2293,XVIII,Some stars shone timidly o'erhead;
2294,XVIII,And towards the west's cadaverous red--
2295,XVIII,Like some wild dream that haunts the dead
2296,XVIII,In limbo--the lean moon was led.
2297,XVIII,
2298,XVIII,"Upon the sad, debatable"
2299,XVIII,Vague lands of twilight slowly fell
2300,XVIII,"A silence that I knew too well,"
2301,XVIII,A sorrow that I can not tell.
2302,XVIII,
2303,XVIII,"What way to take, what path to go,"
2304,XVIII,"Whether into the east's gray glow,"
2305,XVIII,Or where the west burnt red and low--
2306,XVIII,What way to choose I did not know.
2307,XVIII,
2308,XVIII,"So, hesitating, there I stood"
2309,XVIII,Lost in my soul's uncertain wood;
2310,XVIII,One sign I craved of ill or good
2311,XVIII,To lead me from its solitude.
2312,XVIII,
2313,XVIII,
2314,XIX,XIX
2315,XIX,
2316,XIX,It was autumn: and a night
2317,XIX,"Full of whispers and of mist,"
2318,XIX,"With a gray moon, wanly whist,"
2319,XIX,Hanging like a phantom light
2320,XIX,O'er the hills. We stood among
2321,XIX,"Windy fields of weed and flower,"
2322,XIX,"Where the withered seed-pod hung,"
2323,XIX,And the chill leaf-cricket sung.
2324,XIX,Melancholy was the hour
2325,XIX,With the mystery and loneness
2326,XIX,"Of the year, that seemed to look"
2327,XIX,On its own departed face--
2328,XIX,"As our love then, in its oneness,"
2329,XIX,"All its dead past did retrace,"
2330,XIX,And from that sad moment took
2331,XIX,Presage of approaching parting.--
2332,XIX,Sorrowful the hour and dark:
2333,XIX,"Low among the trees, now darting,"
2334,XIX,"Now concealed, a lamp's pale spark--"
2335,XIX,Like a fen-fire--winked and lured
2336,XIX,"Shut among the shadows, where"
2337,XIX,"All was doubtful, unassured,"
2338,XIX,Immaterial; and bare
2339,XIX,Facts of unideal day
2340,XIX,Changed to substance such as dreams.
2341,XIX,"And meseemed then, far away--"
2342,XIX,Farther than remotest gleams
2343,XIX,"Of the stars--lost, separated,"
2344,XIX,"And estranged and out of reach,"
2345,XIX,"Grew our lives away from each,"
2346,XIX,Far away as it was fated.
2347,XIX,
2348,XIX,
2349,XX,XX
2350,XX,
2351,XX,There is no gladness in the day
2352,XX,Now you're away;
2353,XX,"Dull is the morn, the noon is dull,"
2354,XX,Once beautiful;
2355,XX,And when the sunset fills the skies
2356,XX,"With dusking dyes,"
2357,XX,With tired eyes and tired heart
2358,XX,"I sit alone, I sigh apart,"
2359,XX,"And wish for you,"
2360,XX,For only you.
2361,XX,
2362,XX,Ah! darker now the night comes on
2363,XX,Since you are gone;
2364,XX,"Sad are the stars, the moon is sad,"
2365,XX,Once wholly glad;
2366,XX,"And when the stars and moon are set,"
2367,XX,"And earth lies wet,"
2368,XX,"With heart's regret and soul's hard ache,"
2369,XX,"I dream alone, I lie awake,"
2370,XX,"And think of you,"
2371,XX,Of only you.
2372,XX,
2373,XX,"These, who once spake me, speak no more,"
2374,XX,Now all is o'er;
2375,XX,Day hath forgot the language of
2376,XX,Its hopes of love;
2377,XX,"Night, whose sweet lips were burdensome"
2378,XX,"With dreams, is dumb;"
2379,XX,Far different from what used to be
2380,XX,"With grief and loss they speak to me,"
2381,XX,"They speak of you,"
2382,XX,Of only you.
2383,XX,
2384,XX,
2385,XXI,XXI
2386,XXI,
2387,XXI,So it ends--the path that crept
2388,XXI,Through a land all slumber-whist;
2389,XXI,Where the faded moonlight slept
2390,XXI,Like a pale antagonist.
2391,XXI,"Now the star that led me onward,--"
2392,XXI,"Reassuring with its light,--"
2393,XXI,Fails and falters; dipping downward
2394,XXI,"Leaves me wandering in night,"
2395,XXI,"With old doubts, like hounds unchained,"
2396,XXI,"Baying at my back, in flight...."
2397,XXI,So it ends. The woods attained--
2398,XXI,Where our hearts' Desire builded
2399,XXI,"A fair temple, fire-gilded,"
2400,XXI,"With Hope's marble shrine within,"
2401,XXI,(Where the lineaments of our love
2402,XXI,"Shone, with lilies clad and crowned,"
2403,XXI,Under marble reared above
2404,XXI,"Sorrow and her sister, Sin,"
2405,XXI,"Columned, wreathed and ribbon-wound,)--"
2406,XXI,In the forest I have found
2407,XXI,But a ruin! All around
2408,XXI,"Lie the shattered capitals,"
2409,XXI,And vast fragments of the walls ...
2410,XXI,"Like a climbing cloud,--that plies,"
2411,XXI,"Wind-wrecked, o'er the moon that lies"
2412,XXI,"'Neath its blackness,--taking on"
2413,XXI,"Gradual certainties of wan,"
2414,XXI,"Soft assaults of easy white,"
2415,XXI,"(Till its huge cocoon, that holds"
2416,XXI,"Like a moth the moon, unfolds,"
2417,XXI,And it passes) and the skies'
2418,XXI,Emptiness and hungry night
2419,XXI,"Claim its bulk again, while she"
2420,XXI,Rides in lonely purity:--
2421,XXI,So I found our temple broken;
2422,XXI,And a musing moment's space
2423,XXI,"Love, whose latest word was spoken,"
2424,XXI,"Seemed to meet me face to face,"
2425,XXI,Making bright that ruined place
2426,XXI,With a white effulgence--then
2427,XXI,"Passed, and all was dark again."

2514,II,
2515,II,"""Thou lov'st him still,"" they made reply,"

2590,I,While daylight dwindles and the dusk falls fast.
2591,I,"Set in sad walls, all mossy with the past,"
2592,I,An old stone gateway with a crumbling crest;

2595,I,"Here, like an unseen spirit, silence talks"

2699,II,"One mass of briers,--a humpbacked hulk of hair,"

2963,THE VAMPIRE,
2964,THE VAMPIRE,Nor words she murmured while she leaned!

2978,I,With frog-webbed feet and bat-winged hands;

2980,I,"And elfishly, and impishly,"

3003,III,His easy footsteps seem to come--

3120,II,"Where the boughs, with their leaves a-devil's-dance,"

3135,III,"Or _was_ it the wind?... kept whispering me,"
3136,III,"""Come! bury it here with its own black grief,"

3462,GRAMARYE,"What but their chairs the mushrooms on the lawn,"

3899,THE CHANGELING,"Closed, and naught I knew,"
3900,THE CHANGELING,And no more I knew.

3922,THE ELF-QUEEN,You ask me why I wandered wide
3923,THE ELF-QUEEN,When Summer sighed o'er dying June?--
3924,THE ELF-QUEEN,To see the Fairy People ride
3925,THE ELF-QUEEN,Beneath the moon.
3926,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3927,THE ELF-QUEEN,"Wild poppies hedged a hawthorne copse,"
3928,THE ELF-QUEEN,Where glow-worms hung dim lamps of gold;
3929,THE ELF-QUEEN,"A sudden whisper bowed their tops,"
3930,THE ELF-QUEEN,"And then, behold!"
3931,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3932,THE ELF-QUEEN,Between the poppies and the mead
3933,THE ELF-QUEEN,I saw the Fairies riding down:
3934,THE ELF-QUEEN,One fair-faced Fairy in the lead
3935,THE ELF-QUEEN,Crowned with a crown.
3936,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3937,THE ELF-QUEEN,"The night was ringing with their reins,"
3938,THE ELF-QUEEN,So loud the cricket hushed its song;
3939,THE ELF-QUEEN,Bells up and down their horses' manes
3940,THE ELF-QUEEN,Swung sweet along.
3941,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3942,THE ELF-QUEEN,"And whistles, that took all the wind"
3943,THE ELF-QUEEN,With music when they shook their manes;
3944,THE ELF-QUEEN,"So that the fields, before, behind,"
3945,THE ELF-QUEEN,Rang with sweet strains.
3946,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3947,THE ELF-QUEEN,"And as their bridles chiming swung,"
3948,THE ELF-QUEEN,The night seemed cured of every qualm;
3949,THE ELF-QUEEN,"And my sick heart, so wild of tongue,"
3950,THE ELF-QUEEN,Was almost calm.
3951,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3952,THE ELF-QUEEN,"The steeds they rode were fairy steeds,"
3953,THE ELF-QUEEN,Of filmy form and gossamer green;
3954,THE ELF-QUEEN,And every elf was clad in weeds
3955,THE ELF-QUEEN,Of silken sheen.
3956,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3957,THE ELF-QUEEN,"Above, a beam of silver light"
3958,THE ELF-QUEEN,"Beat time to their wild fairy tune,"
3959,THE ELF-QUEEN,"And danced and glanced,--an elfin white"
3960,THE ELF-QUEEN,Not of the moon.
3961,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3962,THE ELF-QUEEN,They were so small the harebell's blue
3963,THE ELF-QUEEN,"Had helmeted each tiny head,"
3964,THE ELF-QUEEN,"Save that fair Fay, who, tall as two,"
3965,THE ELF-QUEEN,The Fairies led.
3966,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3967,THE ELF-QUEEN,Dark tresses floated from a tire
3968,THE ELF-QUEEN,Of diamond sparks that snapped with light;
3969,THE ELF-QUEEN,And all her white sark seemed of fire
3970,THE ELF-QUEEN,Shimmering the night.
3971,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3972,THE ELF-QUEEN,I would have thrown me at her feet
3973,THE ELF-QUEEN,And told her of my grief and pain;
3974,THE ELF-QUEEN,"And she, perhaps, had helped me meet"
3975,THE ELF-QUEEN,My love again.
3976,THE ELF-QUEEN,
3977,THE ELF-QUEEN,"Alas! a cock crew far away,"
3978,THE ELF-QUEEN,"A long-necked cry; and, swift as thought,"

3980,THE ELF-QUEEN,Passed into naught.

4712,THE MERMAID,"The foam-flowers, sad and white."

4772,II,The soft loose clay of its barrow:

4774,II,And near me bloomed the yarrow;

4776,II,Its long stilt-eyes thrust out of its shell:
4777,II,"And I thought, ""This color is worn of the fays,"

4780,II,Wears in the harem the Elf King keeps:
4781,II,And a snail-gray gown each fairy clown
4782,II,Dons when the elf dance whirls and leaps
4783,II,In the light of the moon on the upland down.
4784,II,A snail-shell house for his ouphen spouse

4823,I,"And there in shadow, like gold music writ"

4842,II,No cloud it had to blot its marigold
4843,II,Moon--great and golden--o'er the slopes of musk;
4844,II,Whereon earth's voice made music; tree and stream
4845,II,"Lilting the same low lullaby again,"

4857,III,Faint as a phantom clothed in unseen silk:
4858,III,"Bright as a Naiad's limbs, from shine to shade"
4859,III,The runnel twinkled through the shaken brier;
4860,III,"Above the hills one long cloud, pulsed with fire,"
4861,III,Flashed like a great enchantment-welded blade.
4862,III,"And when the western sky seemed some weird land,"
4863,III,"And night a witch's spell, at whose command"

4935,VII,"Is pale with haw-trees as a ridge with mist,"

4937,VII,"By her young form that lieth white and still,"

5250,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"Old iron gates on posts of stone,"
5251,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,From which the grass-grown roadway leads.
5252,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Five rotting gable-points appear
5253,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"Above bleak yews and cedars sad,"
5254,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Beneath which lies the sleepy mere
5255,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,In lazy lilies clad.
5256,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,
5257,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"At morn the slender dragon-fly,"
5258,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"A living ray of light, darts past;"
5259,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,The burly bee comes charging by
5260,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Winding a surly blast.
5261,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,At noon amid the fervid leaves
5262,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"The insects quarrel, harsh and hot;"
5263,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,In bitter briers the spider weaves
5264,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,A web with silver shot.
5265,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,
5266,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,At eve the hermit cricket rears
5267,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"A plaintive prayer, and creaks and creaks;"
5268,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"The bat, like some wing'd elfin, veers"
5269,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Beneath the sunset's streaks.
5270,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,The caterpillar gnaws the leaf;
5271,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,The mottled toad croaks drowsily;
5272,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"And then the owl, like some dark grief,"
5273,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Cries in the old beech-tree.
5274,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,
5275,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,At night the blistering dew comes down
5276,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,And lies as white as autumn frost
5277,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"Upon the green, upon the brown--"
5278,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,You'd think each bush a ghost.
5279,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,The crescent moon sheathes its white sword
5280,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"Within a cloud; and, gray with fear,"
5281,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,One large blue star keeps stealthy guard
5282,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Above the house and mere.
5283,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,
5284,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,The livid lilies rotting lie
5285,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,On oozy beds of weltering leaves;
5286,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"The will-o'-wisps go flickering by,--"
5287,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"And then the water heaves,"
5288,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"And, like some monstrous blossom there,"
5289,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"A maiden's corpse with staring eyes,"
5290,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"And naked breast and raven hair,"
5291,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Slow in the mere doth rise.
5292,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,
5293,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,And when the clock of some far town
5294,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"Knells midnight, in that house of sins,"
5295,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"In haunted chambers, up and down,"
5296,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,The dance of death begins;
5297,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"And stiff, stiff silks sweep, rustling,"
5298,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,And stately satins none may see;
5299,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,And then soft sounds of music ring
5300,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,In wildest melody.
5301,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,
5302,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,And through the halls the demon dance
5303,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Whirls onward; and dark corridors
5304,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Resound with song and feet that glance
5305,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,Along the falling floors.
5306,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"Then suddenly, as if in fear,"
5307,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,"The music ends, the dance is done;"
5308,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,And booming over house and mere
5309,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,A far-off clock strikes one.
5310,THE OLD HOUSE BY THE MERE,

5315,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5316,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5317,IN AN OLD GARDEN,The autumn glory fades
5318,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Upon the withered trees;
5319,IN AN OLD GARDEN,And over all the dead leaves fall
5320,IN AN OLD GARDEN,And whisper in the breeze.
5321,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5322,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"The violets are dead,"
5323,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"And dead the hollyhocks,"
5324,IN AN OLD GARDEN,That hang like rags by the wind-crushed flags
5325,IN AN OLD GARDEN,And tiger-lily stocks.
5326,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5327,IN AN OLD GARDEN,The wild gourd clambers free
5328,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Where the clematis was wont;
5329,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Where nenuphars bloomed thick as stars
5330,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Rank weeds fill up the fount.
5331,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5332,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"Yet, as in dreams, I hear"
5333,IN AN OLD GARDEN,A tinkling mandolin
5334,IN AN OLD GARDEN,In the dark-blue light of a fragrant night
5335,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Float in and out and in.
5336,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5337,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"Till the dewy vine, that climbs"
5338,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"To a casement's lattice, sways;"
5339,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"And behind the vine, like stars that shine,"
5340,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Two dark eyes gleam and gaze.
5341,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5342,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"And now a perfume comes,"
5343,IN AN OLD GARDEN,A swift Favonian gust;
5344,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"And the shrivelled grass, where it doth pass,"
5345,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Bows worshiping to the dust.
5346,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5347,IN AN OLD GARDEN,I seem to see her drift
5348,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"From tree to moonlit tree,"
5349,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"In her jewelled shawl divinely tall,"
5350,IN AN OLD GARDEN,A mist of drapery.
5351,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5352,IN AN OLD GARDEN,And one awaits her there
5353,IN AN OLD GARDEN,By the broken Psyche old;
5354,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"And there they stand, pale hand in hand,"
5355,IN AN OLD GARDEN,Her thin wrists hooped with gold.
5356,IN AN OLD GARDEN,
5357,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"But a wind sweeps overhead,"
5358,IN AN OLD GARDEN,And the frosty leaves are strewn--
5359,IN AN OLD GARDEN,"And nothing is there but a bough, blown bare,"
5360,IN AN OLD GARDEN,And the light of the ghostly moon.
5361,IN AN OLD GARDEN,

5368,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Its casements, diamond-disked with glass,"
5369,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Look down upon a terrace old,"
5370,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Where urns, unkempt with ragged grass,"
5371,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Foam o'er with hoary cold.
5372,THE HAUNTED ROOM,The snow rounds out each stair of stone;
5373,THE HAUNTED ROOM,The frozen fount is hooped with pearl;
5374,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Down desolate walks, like phantoms blown,"
5375,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Thin, powdery snow-wreaths whirl."
5376,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5377,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"And to each rose-tree's stem, that bends"
5378,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"With silvery snow-combs, glued with frost,"
5379,THE HAUNTED ROOM,It seems each summer rosebud sends
5380,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Its airy, scentless ghost."
5381,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"A stiff Elizabethan pile,"
5382,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"With bleakness chattering in its panes,"
5383,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Where, rumbling down each chimney-file,"
5384,THE HAUNTED ROOM,The mad wind shakes his reins.
5385,THE HAUNTED ROOM,

5387,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5388,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Lone in the northern angle, dim"
5389,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"With immemorial dust, it lies;"
5390,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Where each gaunt casement's stony rim
5391,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Stares eyelike at the skies.
5392,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Drear in the old pile's oldest wing,"
5393,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Hung round with mouldering arras, where"
5394,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Tall, shadowy Tristrams fight and sing"
5395,THE HAUNTED ROOM,For shadowy Isolts fair.
5396,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5397,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Beside a crumbling cabinet
5398,THE HAUNTED ROOM,A tarnished lute lies on the floor;
5399,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"A talon-footed chair is set,"
5400,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Grotesquely, near the door."
5401,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"A carven, testered bedstead stands"
5402,THE HAUNTED ROOM,With rusty silks draped all about;
5403,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"And, like a moon in murky lands,"
5404,THE HAUNTED ROOM,A mirror glimmers out.
5405,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5406,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Neglected, locked that chamber, where"
5407,THE HAUNTED ROOM,In dropping arras dimly clings
5408,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"The drowsy moth; and, frightened there,"
5409,THE HAUNTED ROOM,The lost wind sighs and sings
5410,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Adown the roomy flue, and takes"
5411,THE HAUNTED ROOM,And swings the ghostly mirror till
5412,THE HAUNTED ROOM,It seems some unseen hand that shakes
5413,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Its frame then leaves it still.
5414,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5415,THE HAUNTED ROOM,A starving mouse forever gnaws
5416,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Behind a panel; and the vines,"
5417,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"That on the casement tap like claws,"
5418,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Lattice the floor with lines.--
5419,THE HAUNTED ROOM,I have been there when blades of light
5420,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Stabbed each dull, stained, and dusty pane;"
5421,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Once I was there at dead of night--
5422,THE HAUNTED ROOM,I dream of it again....
5423,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5424,THE HAUNTED ROOM,She grew upon my vision as
5425,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Heat grows that haunts the summer day;
5426,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"In taffetas, like glimmering glass,"
5427,THE HAUNTED ROOM,She stood there dim and gray.
5428,THE HAUNTED ROOM,And will-o'-wisp-like jewels bound
5429,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Faint points of light round neck and wrist;
5430,THE HAUNTED ROOM,And round her slender waist was wound
5431,THE HAUNTED ROOM,A zone of silver mist.
5432,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5433,THE HAUNTED ROOM,And icy as some winter land
5434,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Her pale, still face; o'er which the night"
5435,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Hung of her raven hair; her hand
5436,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Was beautiful and white.
5437,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Before the mirror moaningly
5438,THE HAUNTED ROOM,She wrung her hands and palely pressed
5439,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Her brow.--And did I dream, or see,"
5440,THE HAUNTED ROOM,That blood was on her breast?
5441,THE HAUNTED ROOM,
5442,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"And then she vanished.--Like a breath,"
5443,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"That o'er the limpid glass had passed,"
5444,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Her presence passed; and cold as death
5445,THE HAUNTED ROOM,She left me and aghast.
5446,THE HAUNTED ROOM,"Yes, I've been there when spears of light"
5447,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Pierced thro' each stained and sunlit pane;
5448,THE HAUNTED ROOM,Once I was there at dead of night--
5449,THE HAUNTED ROOM,I dream of it again.

5455,THE MIRROR,
5456,THE MIRROR,
5457,THE MIRROR,An ancient mirror hangs
5458,THE MIRROR,Within an ancient Hall;
5459,THE MIRROR,In a lonely room where th' arrased gloom
5460,THE MIRROR,Scowls from the pictured wall.
5461,THE MIRROR,
5462,THE MIRROR,"A mystic mirror, framed"
5463,THE MIRROR,"In ebon, wildly carved,"
5464,THE MIRROR,"That seems to stare on the shadows there,"
5465,THE MIRROR,Like something lean and starved.
5466,THE MIRROR,
5467,THE MIRROR,"A mirror, where one sees"
5468,THE MIRROR,"In the broad, good light of day,"
5469,THE MIRROR,"Like crimson torches, at the window arches,"
5470,THE MIRROR,Red roses swing and sway.
5471,THE MIRROR,
5472,THE MIRROR,"And a part o' the garth is seen,"
5473,THE MIRROR,"With its quaint stone-dial plate,"
5474,THE MIRROR,"That, gray and old, green-stained with mold,"
5475,THE MIRROR,Stands near the lioned gate.
5476,THE MIRROR,
5477,THE MIRROR,"These it reflects all day,"
5478,THE MIRROR,"And at night one star of blue,"
5479,THE MIRROR,"That the nightingale, where the rose is pale,"
5480,THE MIRROR,Lifts its passionate love-song to.
5481,THE MIRROR,
5482,THE MIRROR,The nightbird sings below;
5483,THE MIRROR,The stars hang bright above;
5484,THE MIRROR,And the roses soon in the sultry moon
5485,THE MIRROR,Shall palpitate with love.
5486,THE MIRROR,
5487,THE MIRROR,The nightbird sobs below;
5488,THE MIRROR,The roses blow and bloom;
5489,THE MIRROR,Through mullioned panes the moonlight rains
5490,THE MIRROR,"In the dim, unholy room."
5491,THE MIRROR,
5492,THE MIRROR,"Grim ancestors that stare,--"
5493,THE MIRROR,"Stiff, starched and haughty,--down"
5494,THE MIRROR,"From the oaken wall of the noble hall,"
5495,THE MIRROR,Put on a sterner frown.
5496,THE MIRROR,
5497,THE MIRROR,"The old, hoarse castle-clock"
5498,THE MIRROR,Coughs midnight overhead--
5499,THE MIRROR,And the rose is wan and the bird is gone
5500,THE MIRROR,When walk the shrouded dead.
5501,THE MIRROR,
5502,THE MIRROR,"Then from their frames, it seems,"
5503,THE MIRROR,The portraits' shadows flit;
5504,THE MIRROR,By the mirror there they stand and stare
5505,THE MIRROR,And weep or sigh to it.
5506,THE MIRROR,
5507,THE MIRROR,"In rare rich ermine, earls"
5508,THE MIRROR,"And knights in gold and vair,"
5509,THE MIRROR,With a rapiered throng of courtiers long
5510,THE MIRROR,Pass with a stately stare.
5511,THE MIRROR,
5512,THE MIRROR,"With jewels and perfumes,"
5513,THE MIRROR,"In powder, ruff, and lace,"
5514,THE MIRROR,Tall ladies pass by the looking-glass
5515,THE MIRROR,Each sighing at her face.
5516,THE MIRROR,
5517,THE MIRROR,"What secret does it hide,"
5518,THE MIRROR,"This mirror, gaunt and tall,"
5519,THE MIRROR,"In this lonely room, where th' arrased gloom"

5531,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Grow barren hill and plain.
5532,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5533,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Ah! over young is she
5534,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Who bears within her breast
5535,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"More pain and woe than women know,"
5536,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,And all of love's unrest.
5537,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5538,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Seven towers of shaggy rock

5548,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"On bat-like turrets high,"

5551,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,As at the battle's scents.
5552,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5553,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"Within the banquet-hall,"
5554,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"A bride, rich-robed and pale,"
5555,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,She sits at board with men o' the sword
5556,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Cased all in silver mail.
5557,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5558,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Their visors barred are drawn;

5561,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Sits at the table's head.

5563,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Wild music echoes through
5564,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,The hollow-sounding air--
5565,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"It seems, at least, a wedding feast"
5566,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,With richness everywhere.
5567,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5568,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Wild music oozes from
5569,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"The ceiling, groined with white"

5577,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5578,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"The heav'ns grow slaughter-red,"

5617,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5618,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Six strokes; and wailing out
5619,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,The music hoots away;
5620,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"The fiery glimmer of heaven grows dimmer,"
5621,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,The red turns ghostly gray.
5622,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5623,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,"Nine strokes; and, dropping mold,"
5624,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,The crumbling Hall is lead;

5626,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,The banqueters are dead.
5627,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,
5628,THE HALL OF DARKNESS,Twelve strokes pound out and roll;

7868,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"The dragon-flies, like coruscating rays"
7869,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Of lapis-lazuli and chrysoprase,"
7870,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Drowsily sparkle through the summer days:
7871,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And, dewlap-deep, here from the noontide heat"
7872,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The bell-hung cattle find a cool retreat;
7873,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And through the willows girdling the hill,"
7874,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Now far, now near, borne as the soft winds will,"
7875,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Comes the low rushing of the water-mill.
7876,THE OLD WATER-MILL,
7877,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Ah, lovely to me from a little child,"
7878,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"How changed the place! wherein once, undefiled,"
7879,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The glad communion of the sky and stream
7880,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Went with me like a presence and a dream.
7881,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Where once the brambled meads and orchard-lands
7882,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Poured ripe abundance down with mellow hands
7883,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Of summer; and the birds of field and wood
7884,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Called to me in a tongue I understood;
7885,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And in the tangles of the old rail-fence
7886,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Even the insect tumult had some sense,"
7887,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And every sound a happy eloquence:
7888,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And more to me than wisest books can teach
7889,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The wind and water said; whose words did reach
7890,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"My soul, addressing their magnificent speech,--"
7891,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Raucous and rushing,--from the old mill-wheel,"
7892,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"That made the rolling mill-cogs snore and reel,"
7893,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Like some old ogre in a fairy tale
7894,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Nodding above his meat and mug of ale.
7895,THE OLD WATER-MILL,
7896,THE OLD WATER-MILL,How memory takes me back the ways that lead--
7897,THE OLD WATER-MILL,As when a boy--through woodland and through mead!
7898,THE OLD WATER-MILL,To orchards fruited; or to fields in bloom;
7899,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Or briery fallows, like a mighty room,"
7900,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Through which the winds swing censers of perfume,"
7901,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And where deep blackberries spread miles of fruit;--
7902,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"A splendid feast, that stayed the ploughboy's foot"
7903,THE OLD WATER-MILL,When to the tasseling acres of the corn
7904,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"He drove his team, fresh in the primrose morn;"
7905,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And from the liberal banquet, nature lent,"
7906,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Took dewy handfuls as he whistling went.--
7907,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"A boy once more, I stand with sunburnt feet"
7908,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And watch the harvester sweep down the wheat;
7909,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Or laze with warm limbs in the unstacked straw
7910,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Nearby the thresher, whose insatiate maw"
7911,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Devours the sheaves, hot drawling out its hum--"
7912,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Like some great sleepy bee, above a bloom,"
7913,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Made drunk with honey--while, grown big with grain,"
7914,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The bulging sacks receive the golden rain.
7915,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Again I tread the valley, sweet with hay,"
7916,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And hear the bob-white calling far away,"
7917,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Or wood-dove cooing in the elder-brake;
7918,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Or see the sassafras bushes madly shake
7919,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"As swift, a rufous instant, in the glen"
7920,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The red fox leaps and gallops to his den;
7921,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Or, standing in the violet-colored gloam,"
7922,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Hear roadways sound with holiday riding home
7923,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"From church, or fair, or county barbecue,"
7924,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Which the whole country to some village drew.
7925,THE OLD WATER-MILL,
7926,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"How spilled with berries were its summer hills,"
7927,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And strewn with walnuts all its autumn rills--
7928,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And chestnuts, burring from the spring's long flowers!--"
7929,THE OLD WATER-MILL,When from their tops the trees seemed streaming showers
7930,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Of slender silver, cool, crepuscular,"
7931,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And like a nebulous radiance shone afar.--
7932,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And maples! how their sappy hearts would gush
7933,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Rude troughs of syrup, when the winter bush"
7934,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Steamed with the sugar-kettle, day and night,"
7935,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And, red, the snow was streaked with fire-light."
7936,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Then was it glorious! the mill-dam's edge,"
7937,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"One slope of frosty crystal, laid a ledge"
7938,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Of pearl across; above which, sleeted trees"
7939,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Tossed arms of ice, that, clashing in the breeze,"
7940,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Tinkled the ringing creek with icicles,"
7941,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Thin as the peal of far-off Elfland bells:
7942,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"A sound that in my city dreams I hear,"
7943,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"That brings before me, under skies that clear,"
7944,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"The old mill in its winter garb of snow,"
7945,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Its frozen wheel like a hoar beard below,"
7946,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And its west windows, two deep eyes aglow."
7947,THE OLD WATER-MILL,
7948,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Ah, ancient mill, still do I picture o'er"
7949,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Thy cobwebbed stairs and loft and grain-strewn floor;
7950,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Thy door,--like some brown, honest hand of toil,"
7951,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And honorable with labor of the soil,--"
7952,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Forever open; through which, on his back"
7953,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"The prosperous farmer bears his bursting sack,"
7954,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And while the miller measures out his toll,"
7955,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Again I hear, above the cogs' loud roll,--"
7956,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"That makes stout joist and rafter groan and sway,--"
7957,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The harmless gossip of the passing day:
7958,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Good country talk, that tells how so-and-so"
7959,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Has died or married; how curculio
7960,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"And codling-moth have ruined half the fruit,"
7961,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And blight plays mischief with the grapes to boot;
7962,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Or what the news from town; next county fair;
7963,THE OLD WATER-MILL,How well the crops are looking everywhere:
7964,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Now this, now that, on which their interests fix,"
7965,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Prospects for rain or frost, and politics."
7966,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"While all around, the sweet smell of the meal"
7967,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Filters, warm-pouring from the grinding wheel"
7968,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Into the bin; beside which, mealy white,"
7969,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"The miller looms, dim in the dusty light."
7970,THE OLD WATER-MILL,
7971,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Again I see the miller's home, between"
7972,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The crinkling creek and hills of beechen green:
7973,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Again the miller greets me, gaunt and brown,"
7974,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Who oft o'erawed my youth with gray-browed frown
7975,THE OLD WATER-MILL,And rugged mien: again he tries to reach
7976,THE OLD WATER-MILL,My youthful mind with fervid scriptural speech.--
7977,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"For he, of all the country-side confessed,"
7978,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The most religious was and goodliest;
7979,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"A Methodist, and one whom faith still led,"
7980,THE OLD WATER-MILL,No books except the Bible had he read--
7981,THE OLD WATER-MILL,At least so seemed it to my younger head.--
7982,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"All things in Earth and Heav'n he'd prove by this,"
7983,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Be it a fact or mere hypothesis;
7984,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"For to his simple wisdom, reverent,"
7985,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"""_The Bible says_"" was all of argument.--"
7986,THE OLD WATER-MILL,God keep his soul! his bones were long since laid
7987,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Among the sunken gravestones in the shade
7988,THE OLD WATER-MILL,"Of those black-lichened rocks, that wall around"
7989,THE OLD WATER-MILL,The family burying-ground with cedars crowned;
7990,THE OLD WATER-MILL,Where bristling teasel and the brier combine
7991,THE OLD WATER-MILL,With clambering wood-rose and the wild-grape vine
7992,THE OLD WATER-MILL,To hide the stone whereon his name and dates

8635,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8636,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"And then, it seemed, 'gainst blazing skies"

8652,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And crash of cymbals and wild peal
8653,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Of battle-bugles, from its walls"
8654,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,An army rushed in glimmering steel.
8655,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8656,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And where it trod he saw the torch
8657,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Of conflagration stalk the skies,"
8658,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And in the vanward of its march
8659,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,The monster form of Havoc rise.
8660,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8661,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"And Paynim war-cries rent the storm,"

8663,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,Destruction reared an earthquake form
8664,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,On wreck and death without a name....
8665,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8666,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And then again the vision changed:
8667,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Where flows the Guadelete, see,"
8668,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,The champions of the Cross are ranged
8669,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,Against the Crescent's chivalry.
8670,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8671,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,With roar of trumpets and of drums
8672,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,They meet; and in the battle's van
8673,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"He fights; and, towering towards him, comes"
8674,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Florinda's father, Julian;"
8675,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8676,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"And one-eyed Taric, great in war:"
8677,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"And where these couch their burning spears,"
8678,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"The Christian phalanx, near and far,"
8679,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,Goes down like corn before the shears.
8680,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8681,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,The Moslem wins: the Christian flies:

8684,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"""Allah il Allah,"" shout again."
8685,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8686,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And then he dreamed the swing of swords
8687,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And hurl of arrows were no more;
8688,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,And stranger than the howling hordes
8689,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,Deep silence fell on field and shore.
8690,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8691,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"And through the night, it seemed, he fled,"
8692,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Upon a white steed like a star,"
8693,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Across a field of endless dead,"
8694,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,Beneath a blood-red scimitar
8695,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,
8696,THE DREAM OF RODERICK,"Of sunset: And he heard a moan,"

8724,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"The rolling mist, like a wandering fleece,"
8725,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"The great, round moon in a mountain crease,"
8726,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And a song of love make the nights all peace.
8727,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8728,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Beneath the blue Tyrolean skies
8729,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"On the banks of the Inn, that foams and flies,"
8730,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The storied city of Innsbruck lies.
8731,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8732,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"With its mediæval streets, that crook,"
8733,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"And its gabled houses, it has the look"
8734,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Of a belfried town in a fairy book.
8735,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8736,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"So wild the Tyrol that oft, 'tis said,"
8737,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"When the storm is out and the town in bed,"
8738,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The howling of wolves sweeps overhead.
8739,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8740,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"And oft the burgher, sitting here"
8741,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"In his walled rose-garden, hears the clear"
8742,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Shrill scream of the eagle circling near.
8743,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8744,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And this is the tale that the burghers tell:--
8745,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The Abbot of Wiltau stood at his cell
8746,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Where the Solstein lifts its pinnacle.
8747,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8748,ZYPS OF ZIRL,A mighty summit of bluffs and crags
8749,ZYPS OF ZIRL,That frowns on the Inn; where the forest stags
8750,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Have worn a path to the water-flags.
8751,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8752,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The Abbot of Wiltau stood below;
8753,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And he was aware of a plume and bow
8754,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"On the precipice there in the morning's glow,"
8755,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8756,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"A chamois, he saw, from span to span"
8757,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Had leapt; and after it leapt a man;
8758,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And he knew 'twas the Kaiser Maximilian.
8759,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8760,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"But, see! though rash as the chamois he,"
8761,ZYPS OF ZIRL,His foot less sure. And verily
8762,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"If the King should miss ... ""Jesu! Marie!"
8763,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8764,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""The King hath missed!""--And, look, he falls!"
8765,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Rolls headlong out to the headlong walls.
8766,ZYPS OF ZIRL,What Saint shall save him on whom he calls?
8767,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8768,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"What Saint shall save him, who struggles there"
8769,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"On the narrow ledge by the eagle's lair,"
8770,ZYPS OF ZIRL,With hook'd hands clinging 'twixt earth and air?
8771,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8772,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The Abbot crosses himself in dread--
8773,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""Let prayers go up for the nearly dead,"
8774,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"And the passing-bell be tolled,"" he said."
8775,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8776,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""For the House of Hapsburg totters! See,"
8777,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"How raveled the thread of its destiny,"
8778,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"Sheer hung between cloud and rock!"" quoth he."
8779,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8780,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"But hark! where the steeps of the peak reply,"
8781,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Is it an eagle's echoing cry?
8782,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"And the flitting shadow, its plumes on high?"
8783,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8784,ZYPS OF ZIRL,No voice of the eagle is that which rings!
8785,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"And the shadow, a wiry man who swings"
8786,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"Down, down where the desperate Kaiser clings."
8787,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8788,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"The _crampons_ bound to his feet, he leaps"
8789,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Like a chamois now; and again he creeps
8790,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"Or twists, like a snake, o'er the fearful deeps."
8791,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8792,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""By his cross-bow, baldric, and cap's black curl,"""
8793,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"Quoth the Abbot below, ""I know the churl!"
8794,ZYPS OF ZIRL,'Tis the hunted outlaw Zyps of Zirl.
8795,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8796,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""Upon whose head, or dead or alive,"
8797,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The Kaiser hath posted a price.--Saints shrive
8798,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"The King!"" quoth Wiltau. ""Who may contrive"
8799,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8800,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""To save him now that his foe is there?""--"
8801,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"But, hark! again through the breathless air"
8802,ZYPS OF ZIRL,What words are those that the echoes bear?
8803,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8804,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"""Courage, my King!--To the rescue, ho!"""
8805,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"The wild voice rings like a twanging bow,"
8806,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And the staring Abbot stands mute below.
8807,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8808,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"And, lo! the hand of the outlaw grasps"
8809,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The arm of the King--and death unclasps
8810,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Its fleshless fingers from him who gasps.
8811,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8812,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And how he guides! where the clean cliffs wedge
8813,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Them flat to their brows; by chasm and ledge
8814,ZYPS OF ZIRL,He helps the King from the merciless edge.
8815,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8816,ZYPS OF ZIRL,"Then up and up, past bluffs that shun"
8817,ZYPS OF ZIRL,The rashest chamois; where eagles sun
8818,ZYPS OF ZIRL,Great wings and brood; where the mists are spun.
8819,ZYPS OF ZIRL,
8820,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And safe at last stand Kaiser and churl
8821,ZYPS OF ZIRL,On the mountain path where the mosses curl--
8822,ZYPS OF ZIRL,And this the revenge of Zyps of Zirl.

8828,THE GLOW-WORM,
8829,THE GLOW-WORM,
8830,THE GLOW-WORM,How long had I sat there and had not beheld
8831,THE GLOW-WORM,The gleam of the glow-worm till something compelled!...
8832,THE GLOW-WORM,
8833,THE GLOW-WORM,"The heaven was starless, the forest was deep,"
8834,THE GLOW-WORM,And the vistas of darkness stretched silent in sleep.
8835,THE GLOW-WORM,
8836,THE GLOW-WORM,And late 'mid the trees had I lingered until
8837,THE GLOW-WORM,No thing was awake but the lone whippoorwill.
8838,THE GLOW-WORM,
8839,THE GLOW-WORM,And haunted of thoughts for an hour I sat
8840,THE GLOW-WORM,On a lichen-gray rock where the moss was a mat.
8841,THE GLOW-WORM,
8842,THE GLOW-WORM,"And thinking of one whom my heart had held dear,"
8843,THE GLOW-WORM,"Like terrible waters, a gathering fear"
8844,THE GLOW-WORM,
8845,THE GLOW-WORM,Came stealing upon me with all the distress
8846,THE GLOW-WORM,Of loss and of yearning and powerlessness:
8847,THE GLOW-WORM,
8848,THE GLOW-WORM,Till the hopes and the doubts and the sleepless unrest
8849,THE GLOW-WORM,"That, swallow-like, built in the home of my breast,"
8850,THE GLOW-WORM,
8851,THE GLOW-WORM,"Now hither, now thither, now heavenward flew,"
8852,THE GLOW-WORM,Wild-winged as the winds are: now suddenly drew
8853,THE GLOW-WORM,
8854,THE GLOW-WORM,My soul to abysses of nothingness where
8855,THE GLOW-WORM,"All light was a shadow, all hope, a despair:"
8856,THE GLOW-WORM,
8857,THE GLOW-WORM,"Where truth, that religion had set upon high,"
8858,THE GLOW-WORM,The darkness distorted and changed to a lie:
8859,THE GLOW-WORM,
8860,THE GLOW-WORM,And dreams of the beauty ambition had fed
8861,THE GLOW-WORM,Like leaves of the autumn fell withered and dead.
8862,THE GLOW-WORM,
8863,THE GLOW-WORM,"And I rose with my burden of anguish and doom,"
8864,THE GLOW-WORM,"And cried, ""O my God, had I died in the womb!"
8865,THE GLOW-WORM,
8866,THE GLOW-WORM,"""Than born into night, with no hope of the morn,"
8867,THE GLOW-WORM,"An heir unto shadows, to live so forlorn!"
8868,THE GLOW-WORM,
8869,THE GLOW-WORM,"""All effort is vain; and the planet called Faith"
8870,THE GLOW-WORM,Sinks down; and no power is real but death.
8871,THE GLOW-WORM,
8872,THE GLOW-WORM,"""O light me a torch in the deepening dark"
8873,THE GLOW-WORM,"So my sick soul may follow, my sad heart may mark!""--"
8874,THE GLOW-WORM,
8875,THE GLOW-WORM,And then in the darkness the answer!--It came
8876,THE GLOW-WORM,"From Earth, not from Heaven--a glimmering flame,"
8877,THE GLOW-WORM,
8878,THE GLOW-WORM,Behold; at my feet! In the shadow it shone
8879,THE GLOW-WORM,Mysteriously lovely and dimly alone:
8880,THE GLOW-WORM,
8881,THE GLOW-WORM,An ember; a sparkle of dew and of glower;
8882,THE GLOW-WORM,Like the lamp that a spirit hangs under a flower:
8883,THE GLOW-WORM,
8884,THE GLOW-WORM,As goldenly green as the phosphorous star
8885,THE GLOW-WORM,A fairy may wear in her diadem's bar:
8886,THE GLOW-WORM,
8887,THE GLOW-WORM,An element essence of moonlight and dawn
8888,THE GLOW-WORM,"That, trodden and trampled, burns on and burns on."
8889,THE GLOW-WORM,
8890,THE GLOW-WORM,And hushed was my soul with the lesson of light
8891,THE GLOW-WORM,That God had revealed to me there in the night:
8892,THE GLOW-WORM,
8893,THE GLOW-WORM,"Though mortal its structure, material its form,"
8894,THE GLOW-WORM,The spiritual message of worm unto worm.
8895,THE GLOW-WORM,

9489,III,"Lock in the wilds of Yucatan,"
9490,III,Chiapas and Honduras. Weeks--
9491,III,And then a city that no man
9492,III,Had even seen; so dim and old
9493,III,No chronicle has ever told
9494,III,The history of men who piled
9495,III,Its temples and huge teocallis
9496,III,Among mimosa-blooming valleys;
9497,III,Or how its altars were defiled
9498,III,With human blood; whose idols there
9499,III,With eyes of stone still stand and stare.
9500,III,
9501,III,"So old, the moon can only know"

9505,III,"With ages, and dense yuccas, hid"
9506,III,"Fanes 'mid great cacti, scarlet-starred."
9507,III,I looked upon its paven ways
9508,III,And saw it in its kingliest days;
9509,III,"When, from its lordliest palace, one"
9510,III,"A victim, walked with prince and priest,"
9511,III,Who turned brown faces toward the east
9512,III,In worship of the rising sun:
9513,III,"At night a thousand temple spires,"

9520,III,"Volcanic rock walled in the whole,"
9521,III,Lost in the woods as in some sea.
9522,III,"_I only_ read its hieroglyphs,"
9523,III,Perused its monster monoliths
9524,III,"Of death, gigantic heads; and read"
9525,III,"The pictured codex of its fate,"
9526,III,The perished Toltec; while in hate
9527,III,"Mad monkeys cursed me, as if dead"
9528,III,Priests of its past had taken form

9536,IV,'Mid Montezuma's priests who walked
9537,IV,Obedient to my nod.
9538,IV,
9539,IV,From Mexic levels breezes blew
9540,IV,O'er green magueys; cacaö fields;
9541,IV,"I stood among caciques, a crew"
9542,IV,With plumes and golden shields.
9543,IV,
9544,IV,In raiment made of humming-birds
9545,IV,Brown slave-girls danced. All Anahuac
9546,IV,"Stood, grim with strange obsidian swords,"
9547,IV,Around the idol's rock.
9548,IV,
9549,IV,And up the temple's winding stair
9550,IV,Of pyramid we wound and went:
9551,IV,The bloomed vanilla drenched the air
9552,IV,With all its tropic scent.
9553,IV,
9554,IV,Volcanoes walled us in: and I
9555,IV,"Walked, crowned with flaming cactus-flowers,"
9556,IV,"Beneath the golden, Aztec sky,"
9557,IV,Lord of the living hours.
9558,IV,
9559,IV,"When, lo! five priests, who led me to"

9562,IV,That prideful moment's price.
9563,IV,
9564,IV,"A sixth priest, robed in cochineal,"
9565,IV,Received me at the altar's stone:
9566,IV,"I saw the flint-blade, sharp as steel,"
9567,IV,That in his high hand shone.
9568,IV,
9569,IV,O God! to dream that they would bind--
9570,IV,With pomp and pageant of their love--
9571,IV,"Me to the rock, and never blind"
9572,IV,Mine eyes to that above!
9573,IV,
9574,IV,"I felt the flint hack through my breast,"
9575,IV,And in my agony did raise
9576,IV,"Wild eyes, a little while to rest"
9577,IV,Upon their idol's face.
9578,IV,
9579,IV,"Just God! the priest tore out my heart,"
9580,IV,"And held it, beating, to the sun--"
9581,IV,Chanting--and from one burning part
9582,IV,"Great drops dripped, one by one."
9583,IV,
9584,IV,"Torn out, I felt my heart still beat,"
9585,IV,I felt it beat with pain divine;
9586,IV,"For, bleeding at the idol's feet,"
9587,IV,My heart was pressed to thine.
9588,IV,
9589,IV,
9590,V,V
9591,V,
9592,V,You were a maiden like a dream
9593,V,Who led me where volcanic dust
9594,V,"Rained in a scoriac mountain stream,"
9595,V,"Where, from Andean snows, was thrust"
9596,V,One crater belching stones and steam.
9597,V,
9598,V,You were an Inca princess when
9599,V,"I was a cavalier of Spain,"
9600,V,"Who frowned among Pizarro's men,"
9601,V,And saw the New World rent with pain.--
9602,V,No grace of God could save me then.
9603,V,
9604,V,And it was you who led me far
9605,V,To gaze on caves of Inca gold:
9606,V,"But when we came, lo! warrior"
9607,V,"On warrior, an army rolled"
9608,V,Around us panoplied for war.
9609,V,
9610,V,Fierce faces chiseled out of stone
9611,V,"Are not more stern.--Down, underneath,"
9612,V,I heard the sullen earthquake groan;

9701,A LEGEND OF THE LILY,
9702,A LEGEND OF THE LILY,The face of a girl whose brow was wan;
9703,A LEGEND OF THE LILY,"To whom the kind sun spoke at dawn,"
9704,A LEGEND OF THE LILY,And a star and the moon when the day was gone.
9705,A LEGEND OF THE LILY,
9706,A LEGEND OF THE LILY,And oft and often the sun had said--

9942,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And tore away its veil.
9943,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9944,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And time went by; and sea and sky
9945,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Had worn our masts and decks;
9946,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"When, lo! one morn with canvas torn,"
9947,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"A phantom ship, we came forlorn"
9948,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Into the Sea of Wrecks.
9949,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9950,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"There, day and night, the mist lay white,"
9951,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And pale stars shone at noon;
9952,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"The sea around was foam and fire,"
9953,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And overhead hung, thin as wire,"
9954,THE ISLE OF VOICES,A will-o'-wisp of moon.
9955,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9956,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And through the mist, all white and whist,"
9957,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Gaunt ships, with sea-weed wound,"
9958,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"With rotting masts, upon whose spars"
9959,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"The corposants lit spectre stars,"
9960,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Sailed by without a sound.
9961,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9962,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And all about,--now in, now out,--"
9963,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Their ancient hulls, was shed"
9964,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"The worm-like glow of green decay,"
9965,THE ISLE OF VOICES,That writhed and glimmered in the gray
9966,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Of canvas overhead.
9967,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9968,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And each that passed, in hull and mast,"
9969,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Seemed that wild ship that flees
9970,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Before the tempest--seamen tell--
9971,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Deep-cargoed with the curse of Hell,"
9972,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Through roaring rain and seas.
9973,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9974,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Ay! many a craft we left abaft
9975,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Upon that haunted sea;
9976,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"But never a hulk that clewed a sail,"
9977,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Or waved a hand, or answered hail,"
9978,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And never a man saw we.
9979,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9980,THE ISLE OF VOICES,At last we came where--pouring flame--
9981,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"In darkness and in storm,"
9982,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Vast a volcano westward reared
9983,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"An awful summit, lava-seared,"

9985,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9986,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And we could feel beneath our keel
9987,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"The ocean throb and swell,"
9988,THE ISLE OF VOICES,As if the Earthquake there uncoiled
9989,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Its monster bulk, or Titans toiled"
9990,THE ISLE OF VOICES,At the red heart of Hell.
9991,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9992,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Like madmen now we turned our prow
9993,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"North, towards an ocean weird"
9994,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Of Northern Lights and icy blasts;
9995,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And for ten moons with reeling masts
9996,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And leaking hold we steered.
9997,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
9998,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Then black as blood through streaming scud
9999,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Land loomed above our boom,"
10000,THE ISLE OF VOICES,An isle of iron gulfs and crags
10001,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And cataracts, like wind-tossed rags,"
10002,THE ISLE OF VOICES,And caverns lost in gloom.
10003,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
10004,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And burning white on every height,"
10005,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"And white in every cave,"
10006,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"A naked spirit, like a flame,"
10007,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"Now gleamed, now vanished; went and came"
10008,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Above the windy wave.
10009,THE ISLE OF VOICES,
10010,THE ISLE OF VOICES,No mortal thing of foot or wing
10011,THE ISLE OF VOICES,Made glad its steep or strand;
10012,THE ISLE OF VOICES,"But voices, voices seemingly--"

10448,I,"And, glimmering in it, like a firefly caught"
10449,I,"Upon the thorns, the light of one white star,"
10450,I,"Looked in on you, as if they felt and thought,"
10451,I,"As did my heart,--""How beautiful and fair"
10452,I,"And young she lies, white violets in her hair!"""
10453,I,
10454,I,"And so we looked upon you, white and still,"
10455,I,"The star, the rose, and I. The moon had past,"
10456,I,"Like a pale traveler, behind the hill"
10457,I,With all her sorrowful silver. And at last
10458,I,"Darkness and tears and you, who did not care,"
10459,I,"Lying so still, white violets in your hair."

10467,A STUDY IN GRAY,"A woman, fair to look upon,"
10468,A STUDY IN GRAY,Where waters whiten with the moon;
10469,A STUDY IN GRAY,"Around whom, glimmering o'er the lawn,"
10470,A STUDY IN GRAY,The white moths swoon.
10471,A STUDY IN GRAY,
10472,A STUDY IN GRAY,A mouth of music; eyes of love;
10473,A STUDY IN GRAY,"And hands of blended snow and scent,"
10474,A STUDY IN GRAY,That touch the pearly shadow of
10475,A STUDY IN GRAY,An instrument.
10476,A STUDY IN GRAY,
10477,A STUDY IN GRAY,And low and sweet that song of sleep
10478,A STUDY IN GRAY,After the song of love is hushed;
10479,A STUDY IN GRAY,"While all the longing, here, to weep,"
10480,A STUDY IN GRAY,Is held and crushed.
10481,A STUDY IN GRAY,
10482,A STUDY IN GRAY,"Then leafy silence, that is musk"
10483,A STUDY IN GRAY,"With breath of the magnolia tree,"
10484,A STUDY IN GRAY,"While dwindles, moth-white, through the dusk"
10485,A STUDY IN GRAY,Her drapery.
10486,A STUDY IN GRAY,
10487,A STUDY IN GRAY,Let me remember how a heart
10488,A STUDY IN GRAY,Wrote its romance upon that night!--
10489,A STUDY IN GRAY,God help my soul to read each part
10490,A STUDY IN GRAY,Of it aright!
10491,A STUDY IN GRAY,
10492,A STUDY IN GRAY,And like a dead leaf shut between

10495,A STUDY IN GRAY,Of life I mark.

10501,II,That song's appealing melody:
10502,II,"The pain of loss comes all too near,"
10503,II,"Through it, to me."
10504,II,
10505,II,The loss of her whose love looks through
10506,II,The mist death's hand hath hung between--
10507,II,Within the shadow of the yew
10508,II,Her grave is green.
10509,II,
10510,II,"Ah, dream that vanished long ago!"
10511,II,"Oh, anguish of remembered tears!"
10512,II,And shadow of unlifted woe
10513,II,Athwart the years!
10514,II,
10515,II,"That haunt the sad rooms of my days,"
10516,II,"As keepsakes of unperished love,"

10518,II,"Hangs, framed above."
10519,II,
10520,II,"This olden song of love and sleep,"
10521,II,"She used to sing, is now a spell"
10522,II,That opens doors within the deep
10523,II,"Of my heart's hell,"
10524,II,
10525,II,In music making visible
10526,II,"One soul-assertive memory,"
10527,II,That steals unto my side to tell
10528,II,My loss to me.

10537,AT VESPERS,"A girl stands, slim and fair;"

10539,AT VESPERS,Gleams out her radiant hair.

10552,AT VESPERS,"A voice of crystal soars,"

10556,AT VESPERS,And out of the altar's dimness
10557,AT VESPERS,"An answering voice doth swell,"
10558,AT VESPERS,Of passion that cries from the grimness
10559,AT VESPERS,And anguish of its own hell.
10560,AT VESPERS,
10561,AT VESPERS,High up in the organ-story
10562,AT VESPERS,One kneels with a girlish grace;

10564,AT VESPERS,Lifts her madonna face.
10565,AT VESPERS,
10566,AT VESPERS,"One stands at the cloudy altar,"
10567,AT VESPERS,A form bowed down and thin;
10568,AT VESPERS,The text of the psalm in the psalter
10569,AT VESPERS,He chants is sorrow and sin.
