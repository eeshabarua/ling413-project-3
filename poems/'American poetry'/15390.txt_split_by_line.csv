46,NOTE.,The distinctive feature of this edition of Evangeline is the PLAN OF STUDY
47,NOTE.,which forms the latter part of the volume.
48,NOTE.,
49,NOTE.,"This Plan for the study of ""Evangeline"" is the outgrowth of several years'"
50,NOTE.,teaching of this delightful poem. It has proved successful in securing very
51,NOTE.,"satisfactory work from classes varying greatly in ability. It has resulted,"
52,NOTE.,"in a considerable majority of cases, in (1) in awakening an interest in and"
53,NOTE.,a love for good literature; (2) opening up the field of literature in a
54,NOTE.,"new way, and showing that much wealth may be gotten by digging below"
55,NOTE.,the surface; (3) developing a considerable power of discrimination; (4)
56,NOTE.,"enlarging the pupil's working vocabulary. See ""Argument"" on page 113."

94,THE AUTHOR.,
95,THE AUTHOR.,"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was born in Portland, Maine, February 27, 1807."
96,THE AUTHOR.,"His father and mother were of English stock, his mother being a descendant"
97,THE AUTHOR.,"of ""John Alden and Priscilla."" Stephen Longfellow, his father, was a lawyer"
98,THE AUTHOR.,and statesman. Henry's school life began at the age of three. When he was
99,THE AUTHOR.,"six years old he could read, spell and multiply, and at the age of seven was"
100,THE AUTHOR.,"half way through his Latin grammar. He early showed a taste for reading, and"
101,THE AUTHOR.,"read not only his father's small stock of books, but frequented the Portland"
102,THE AUTHOR.,"Library and book stores. ""The Battle of Lovell's Pond"" was his first poem,"
103,THE AUTHOR.,written when he was thirteen. He entered Bowdoin College at the age of
104,THE AUTHOR.,"fourteen, graduating in 1825. During the latter part of his student"
105,THE AUTHOR.,life there he began to show a considerable literary bent. Shortly after
106,THE AUTHOR.,"graduating from Bowdoin, Longfellow was elected Professor of Modern"
107,THE AUTHOR.,"Languages in that institution. Before entering upon his work, he spent three"
108,THE AUTHOR.,"years in study and travel in Europe, returning to America in 1829. For five"
109,THE AUTHOR.,"and one-half years he taught in Bowdoin, during which time he began serious"
110,THE AUTHOR.,"work as an author. In 1834, Harvard called him to the chair of Modern"
111,THE AUTHOR.,Languages. He again made a trip to Europe for further study. Longfellow was
112,THE AUTHOR.,"connected with Harvard for nineteen years, resigning his position in 1854 to"
113,THE AUTHOR.,devote his whole time to literature.
114,THE AUTHOR.,
115,THE AUTHOR.,"His two principal prose works are ""Outre Mer"" and ""Hyperion."" The latter was"
116,THE AUTHOR.,"followed by a volume of poems entitled ""Voices of the Night."" ""Ballads and"
117,THE AUTHOR.,"Other Poems"" appeared in 1841, and showed much more talent. ""Evangeline"" was"
118,THE AUTHOR.,"written in 1847; ""Hiawatha"" in 1855, and the ""Courtship of Miles Standish"""
119,THE AUTHOR.,"in 1857. ""Evangeline"" and ""Hiawatha"" are considered the best of his longer"
120,THE AUTHOR.,"poems. ""The Building of the Ship"" and ""Excelsior"" are perhaps the best known"
121,THE AUTHOR.,of his shorter poems.

129,THE POEM.,
130,THE POEM.,"""Evangeline"" is considered Longfellow's masterpiece among his longer"
131,THE POEM.,poems. It is said to have been the author's favorite. It has a universal
132,THE POEM.,"popularity, having been translated into many languages."
133,THE POEM.,
134,THE POEM.,"E.C. Stedman styles it the ""Flower of American Idyls."""
135,THE POEM.,
136,THE POEM.,"""Evangeline"" is a Narrative poem, since it tells a story. Some of the"
137,THE POEM.,"world's greatest poems have been of this kind, notably the ""Iliad"" and the"
138,THE POEM.,"""Odyssey"" of Homer, and the ""Aeneid,"" of Virgil. It may be also classified"
139,THE POEM.,"as an Idyl, which is a simple, pastoral poem of no great length."
140,THE POEM.,
141,THE POEM.,"Poetry has been defined as ""impassioned expression in verse or metrical"
142,THE POEM.,"form."" All modern English poetry has metre, and much of it rhyme. By"
143,THE POEM.,metre is meant a regular recurrence of accented syllables among unaccented
144,THE POEM.,"syllables. ""Evangeline"" is written in what is called hexameter, having"
145,THE POEM.,six accents to the line. An accented syllable is followed by one or two
146,THE POEM.,"unaccented. A line must begin with an accented syllable, the last accent"
147,THE POEM.,"but one be followed by two unaccented syllables, and the last by one."
148,THE POEM.,"Representing an accented syllable by O and an unaccented syllable by a -,"
149,THE POEM.,the first line of the poem would be as follows:
150,THE POEM.,
151,O   -  -   O  -  -  O  -    -   O  -  -    O    -   -   O  -,O   -  -   O  -  -  O  -    -   O  -  -    O    -   -   O  -

166,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
167,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"Acadia, now known as Nova Scotia, was settled by the French in 1607. Many of"
168,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"the colonists settled in the fertile region about the Bay of Minas, an arm"
169,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"of the Bay of Fundy. One of these settlements was called Grand Pre, meaning"
170,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Great Meadow. The people were industrious and thrifty and they soon attained
171,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,a considerable prosperity.
172,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
173,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"During the early period of American History, France and England were almost"
174,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"continually at war with one another, and in these wars the colonists were"
175,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"concerned. At the close of what is known as Queen Anne's war, in 1713,"
176,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"France ceded Acadia to the English, and it has since remained in their"
177,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,possession. Some thirty-five years passed before an English settlement
178,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"was made at Halifax, the Acadians in the meantime remaining in undisturbed"
179,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,possession of the country. Soon after the settlement of Halifax trouble
180,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,began between the rival colonists.
181,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
182,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"The Acadians were, as a whole, a quiet and peaceable people, content to till"
183,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,their farms and let the mother countries settle any disputes. Some of them
184,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,were not thus minded and they succeeded in causing considerable trouble.
185,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Frequent attacks were made upon Halifax by the Indians who were supposed to
186,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,have been aided and encouraged by the Acadians. The Acadians had refused
187,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,to take the oath of allegiance to the English and this caused them to be
188,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,regarded with suspicion and fear. They had sworn fidelity on the condition
189,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"that they should not be required to bear arms against the French, with"
190,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"whom they naturally sympathized, being of the same blood and religion. They"
191,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,persistently refused to go further and swear allegiance.
192,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
193,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,The English were not without blame since it must be admitted they had
194,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,covetous eyes upon the rich farms of the Acadians and an opportunity to take
195,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,possession of them would not be unwelcome.
196,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
197,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,[Illustration: Map of Annapolis and Kings Counties.]
198,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
199,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,The strife that had so long been going on between France and England to
200,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,determine which should rule in the New World was now at a critical point.
201,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,England's power seemed to be trembling in the balance. Her defeat meant
202,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"great disaster to the Colonies. Alarmed by Braddock's failure, the Colonists"
203,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,determined something must be done to prevent the Acadians giving assistance
204,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"to the French. To send them to Canada would be to strengthen the enemy,"
205,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,while to transport them to any one of the Colonies would be equally unwise
206,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,since they would there be a source of danger. It was finally decided to
207,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,scatter them among the different settlements. An order was issued requiring
208,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,all the males of Grand Pre and vicinity ten years old and upwards to
209,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,assemble in the church to hear a Proclamation of the King. Failure to attend
210,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,would result in a forfeiture of all property of the individual. On the
211,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,appointed day the men gathered in the church and heard the Mandate directing
212,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"that all their property, excepting household goods and money, should be"
213,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,forfeited to the Crown and they with their families should be transported to
214,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"other lands. They were held prisoners until the time of sailing, the women"
215,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,and the children gathering their belongings on the beach. The expected
216,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,transports failed to arrive on time and fear of trouble led the English
217,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,to hurry their prisoners aboard the few ships in the harbor. These were
218,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"so crowded nearly all the goods had to be left behind, and in the haste"
219,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"of embarking many families, lovers and friends were parted, being carried"
220,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,aboard different ships bound for different ports.
221,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
222,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"On October 29th, 1755, the Acadians sailed away into exile, an ""exile"
223,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"without an end, and without an example in story."""
224,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
225,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,There is a considerable difference of opinion as to whether such extreme
226,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,measures were justified. The English Colonists evidently felt that it was
227,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"a necessary act, an act of self-preservation. It is, perhaps, no worse than"
228,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"many of the horrors of war. On the other hand the Acadians had, as a whole,"
229,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"committed no overt act of disloyalty, though a few of them had done so."
230,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Should a whole community thus suffer for the wrong doing of a few? This is
231,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,certainly a difficult question.
232,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
233,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Those interested in the subject should read an article by Parkman in
234,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"""Harper's Magazine"" for November, 1884, where he justifies the action. For"
235,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"the opposite view, see ""Acadia"" by Edouard Richards, vol. I, chap. IV."
236,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
237,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,The following quotations will be found of interest. The first is from
238,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Edouard Richards; the second and third from two of contemporaries of the
239,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"exiled Acadians, Moses de les Derniers and Brook Watson."
240,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
241,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"""All that vast bay, around which but lately an industrious people worked"
242,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"like a swarm of bees, was now deserted. In the silent village, where the"
243,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"doors swung idly in the wind, nothing was heard but the tramp of soldiery"
244,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"and the lowing of cattle, wandering anxiously around the stables as if"
245,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,looking for their masters....The total amount of live-stock owned by the
246,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Acadians at the time of the deportation has been variously estimated by
247,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"different historians, or to speak more correctly, very few have paid any"
248,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"attention to this subject....Rameau, who has made a much deeper study than"
249,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"any other historian of the Acadians, sets the total at 130,000, comprising"
250,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"horned cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs."""
251,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,
252,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,Edouard Richard quotes the following from two contemporaries of the exiled
253,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"Acadians. ""The Acadians were the most innocent and virtuous people I have"
254,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,ever known or read of in any history. They lived in a state of perfect
255,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"equality, without distinction of rank in society. The title of 'Mister' was"
256,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"unknown among them. Knowing nothing of luxury, or even the conveniences of"
257,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"life, they were content with a simple manner of living, which they easily"
258,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,compassed by the tillage of their lands. Very little ambition or avarice
259,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,was to be seen among them; they anticipated each other's wants by kindly
260,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,liberality; they demanded no interest for loans of money or other property.
261,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"They were humane and hospitable to strangers, and very liberal toward those"
262,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,who embraced their religion. They were very remarkable for their inviolable
263,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"purity of morals. If any disputes arose in their transactions, they always"
264,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"submitted to the decision of an arbitrator, and their final appeal was to"
265,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"their priest.""--_Moses de les Derniers_."

267,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"""Young men were not encouraged to marry unless the young girl could weave"
268,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"a piece of cloth, and the young man make a pair of wheels. These"
269,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"accomplishments were deemed essential for their marriage settlement, and"
270,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,they hardly needed anything else; for every time there was a wedding the
271,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,whole village contributed to set up the newly married couple. They built a
272,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"house for them, and cleared enough land for their immediate needs; they gave"
273,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"them live stock and poultry; and nature, seconded by their own labor, soon"
274,ACADIA AND THE ACADIANS.,"put them in a position to help others.""--_Brook Watson_."

326,SECTION I.,"Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic         30"
327,SECTION I.,"Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended."
328,SECTION I.,"There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village."
329,SECTION I.,"Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,"
330,SECTION I.,Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.
331,SECTION I.,"Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting      35"
332,SECTION I.,Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway.
333,SECTION I.,"There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset"
334,SECTION I.,"Lighted the village street, and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,"
335,SECTION I.,Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles
336,SECTION I.,"Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden            40"
337,SECTION I.,"Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors"
338,SECTION I.,Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens.
339,SECTION I.,"Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children"
340,SECTION I.,Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.
341,SECTION I.,"Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,          45"
342,SECTION I.,Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.
343,SECTION I.,"Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank"
344,SECTION I.,"Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed. Anon from the belfry"
345,SECTION I.,"Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village"
346,SECTION I.,"Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,            50"
347,SECTION I.,"Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment."
348,SECTION I.,"Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,--"
349,SECTION I.,Dwelt in the love of God and of man. Alike were they free from
350,SECTION I.,"Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics."
351,SECTION I.,"Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;        55"
352,SECTION I.,But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners;
353,SECTION I.,"There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance."
354,SECTION I.,
355,SECTION I.,"Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas,"
356,SECTION I.,"Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre,"
357,SECTION I.,"Dwelt on his goodly acres; and with him, directing his household,        60"
358,SECTION I.,"Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village."
359,SECTION I.,Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;
360,SECTION I.,"Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snow-flakes;"
361,SECTION I.,"White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves."
362,SECTION I.,"Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers;                65"
363,SECTION I.,"Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,"
364,SECTION I.,"Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!"
365,SECTION I.,Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.
366,SECTION I.,When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
367,SECTION I.,"Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden.            70"
368,SECTION I.,"Fairer was she, when on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret"
369,SECTION I.,"Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop"
370,SECTION I.,"Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them"
371,SECTION I.,"Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,"
372,SECTION I.,"Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings         75"
373,SECTION I.,"Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom,"

377,SECTION I.,Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.            80
378,SECTION I.,"When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music."
379,SECTION I.,
380,SECTION I.,"Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer"
381,SECTION I.,Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady
382,SECTION I.,"Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it."
383,SECTION I.,"Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath          85"
384,SECTION I.,"Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow."
385,SECTION I.,"Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,"
386,SECTION I.,"Such as the traveler sees in regions remote by the roadside,"
387,SECTION I.,"Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary."
388,SECTION I.,"Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown 90"
389,SECTION I.,"Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses."
390,SECTION I.,"Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farmyard;"
391,SECTION I.,There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique plows and harrows;
392,SECTION I.,"There were the folds for the sheep, and there in his feathered seraglio,"
393,SECTION I.,"Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame       95"
394,SECTION I.,Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.
395,SECTION I.,"Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village. In each one"
396,SECTION I.,"Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,"
397,SECTION I.,"Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous cornloft."
398,SECTION I.,"There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates        100"
399,SECTION I.,Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes
400,SECTION I.,Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.
401,SECTION I.,
402,SECTION I.,"Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pre"
403,SECTION I.,"Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household."
404,SECTION I.,"Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,          105"
405,SECTION I.,Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;
406,SECTION I.,Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!
407,SECTION I.,"Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,"
408,SECTION I.,"And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,"
409,SECTION I.,"Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;       110"
410,SECTION I.,"Or, at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,"
411,SECTION I.,"Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered"
412,SECTION I.,"Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music."
413,SECTION I.,But among all who came young Gabriel only was welcome;
414,SECTION I.,"Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,                    115"
415,SECTION I.,"Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;"
416,SECTION I.,"For since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,"
417,SECTION I.,Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.
418,SECTION I.,Basil was Benedict's friend. Their children from earliest childhood
419,SECTION I.,"Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,            120"
420,SECTION I.,"Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters"
421,SECTION I.,"Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song."
422,SECTION I.,"But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,"
423,SECTION I.,Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.
424,SECTION I.,"There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him         125"
425,SECTION I.,"Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,"
426,SECTION I.,Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel
427,SECTION I.,"Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders."
428,SECTION I.,"Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness"
429,SECTION I.,"Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice, 130"
430,SECTION I.,"Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,"
431,SECTION I.,"And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,"
432,SECTION I.,"Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel."
433,SECTION I.,"Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,"
434,SECTION I.,"Down the hillside bounding, they glided away o'er the meadow.           135"
435,SECTION I.,"Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,"
436,SECTION I.,"Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow"
437,SECTION I.,Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;
438,SECTION I.,Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!
439,SECTION I.,"Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children.        140"
440,SECTION I.,"He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,"
441,SECTION I.,"Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action."
442,SECTION I.,"She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman."
443,SECTION I.,"""Sunshine of St. Eulalie"" was she called; for that was the sunshine"
444,SECTION I.,"Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples;  145"
445,SECTION I.,"She too would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,"
446,SECTION I.,Filling it full of love and ruddy faces of children.
447,SECTION I.,
448,SECTION I.,
449,SECTION II.,SECTION II.
450,SECTION II.,
451,SECTION II.,
452,SECTION II.,"Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,"
453,SECTION II.,And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.
454,SECTION II.,"Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,     150"
455,SECTION II.,Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands.
456,SECTION II.,Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September
457,SECTION II.,"Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel."
458,SECTION II.,All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.
459,SECTION II.,"Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey          155"
460,SECTION II.,Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian hunters asserted
461,SECTION II.,"Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes."
462,SECTION II.,"Such was the advent of autumn. Then followed that beautiful season,"
463,SECTION II.,Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!
464,SECTION II.,Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape   160
465,SECTION II.,Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.
466,SECTION II.,"Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean"
467,SECTION II.,Was for a moment consoled. All sounds were in harmony blended.
468,SECTION II.,"Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,"
469,SECTION II.,"Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons              165"
470,SECTION II.,"All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun"
471,SECTION II.,Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;
472,SECTION II.,"While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,"
473,SECTION II.,"Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest"
474,SECTION II.,Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and jewels. 170
475,SECTION II.,
476,SECTION II.,Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.
477,SECTION II.,"Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending"
478,SECTION II.,"Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead."
479,SECTION II.,"Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,"
480,SECTION II.,And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening. 175
481,SECTION II.,"Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer,"
482,SECTION II.,"Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,"
483,SECTION II.,"Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection."
484,SECTION II.,"Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,"
485,SECTION II.,"Where was their favorite pasture. Behind them followed the watch-dog, 180"
486,SECTION II.,"Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,"
487,SECTION II.,"Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly"
488,SECTION II.,"Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;"
489,SECTION II.,"Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,"
490,SECTION II.,"When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled. 185"
491,SECTION II.,"Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,"
492,SECTION II.,"Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor."
493,SECTION II.,"Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,"
494,SECTION II.,"While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,"
495,SECTION II.,"Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,       190"
496,SECTION II.,"Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms."
497,SECTION II.,"Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders"
498,SECTION II.,Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence
499,SECTION II.,Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.
500,SECTION II.,"Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,     195"
501,SECTION II.,Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;
502,SECTION II.,"Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,"
503,SECTION II.,"Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent."
504,SECTION II.,
505,SECTION II.,"In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer"
506,SECTION II.,"Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths 200"
507,SECTION II.,"Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him,"
508,SECTION II.,"Nodding and mocking along the wall with gestures fantastic,"
509,SECTION II.,"Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness."
510,SECTION II.,"Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair,"
511,SECTION II.,"Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser   205"
512,SECTION II.,"Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine."
513,SECTION II.,"Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,"
514,SECTION II.,"Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him"
515,SECTION II.,Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.
516,SECTION II.,"Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,            210"
517,SECTION II.,Spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her.
518,SECTION II.,"Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,"
519,SECTION II.,"While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,"
520,SECTION II.,"Followed the old man's song, and united the fragments together."
521,SECTION II.,"As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,        215"
522,SECTION II.,"Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of priest at the altar,"
523,SECTION II.,"So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked."
524,SECTION II.,
525,SECTION II.,"Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,"
526,SECTION II.,"Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges."
527,SECTION II.,"Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,      220"
528,SECTION II.,And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.
529,SECTION II.,"""Welcome!"" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold,"
530,SECTION II.,"""Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle"
531,SECTION II.,"Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;"
532,SECTION II.,Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;           225
533,SECTION II.,"Never so much thyself art thou as when, through the curling"
534,SECTION II.,"Smoke of the pipe or the forge, thy friendly and jovial face gleams"
535,SECTION II.,"Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes."""
536,SECTION II.,"Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,"
537,SECTION II.,Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:--             230
538,SECTION II.,"""Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!"
539,SECTION II.,"Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with"
540,SECTION II.,"Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them."
541,SECTION II.,"Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe."""
542,SECTION II.,"Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,         235"
543,SECTION II.,"And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:--"
544,SECTION II.,"""Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors"
545,SECTION II.,"Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us."
546,SECTION II.,What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded
547,SECTION II.,"On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate        240"
548,SECTION II.,Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the mean time
549,SECTION II.,"Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people."""
550,SECTION II.,"Then made answer the farmer:--""Perhaps some friendlier purpose"
551,SECTION II.,Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England
552,SECTION II.,"By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,                245"
553,SECTION II.,"And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children."""
554,SECTION II.,"""Not so thinketh the folk in the village,"" said warmly the blacksmith,"
555,SECTION II.,"Shaking his head as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:--"
556,SECTION II.,"""Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal."
557,SECTION II.,"Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,        250"
558,SECTION II.,Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.
559,SECTION II.,"Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;"
560,SECTION II.,"Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower."""
561,SECTION II.,Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:--
562,SECTION II.,"""Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,   255"
563,SECTION II.,"Safer within these peaceful dikes besieged by the ocean,"
564,SECTION II.,"Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon."
565,SECTION II.,"Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow"
566,SECTION II.,Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.
567,SECTION II.,Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village         260
568,SECTION II.,"Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,"
569,SECTION II.,"Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth."
570,SECTION II.,"Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn."
571,SECTION II.,"Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?"""
572,SECTION II.,"As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,         265"
573,SECTION II.,"Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,"
574,SECTION II.,"And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered."
575,SECTION II.,
576,SECTION II.,
577,SECTION III.,SECTION III.
578,SECTION III.,
579,SECTION III.,
580,SECTION III.,"Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,"
581,SECTION III.,"Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;"
582,SECTION III.,"Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung         270"
583,SECTION III.,Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows
584,SECTION III.,"Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal."
585,SECTION III.,"Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred"
586,SECTION III.,"Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick."
587,SECTION III.,"Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,    275"
588,SECTION III.,Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.
589,SECTION III.,"Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,"
590,SECTION III.,"Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike."
591,SECTION III.,"He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;"
592,SECTION III.,"For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,                 280"
593,SECTION III.,"And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,"
594,SECTION III.,"And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened"
595,SECTION III.,"Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;"
596,SECTION III.,"And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,"
597,SECTION III.,"And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,          285"
598,SECTION III.,"And of the marvelous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,"
599,SECTION III.,With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.
600,SECTION III.,"Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,"
601,SECTION III.,"Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,"
602,SECTION III.,"""Father Leblanc,"" he exclaimed, ""thou hast heard the talk in the village, 290"
603,SECTION III.,"And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand."""
604,SECTION III.,"Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,--"
605,SECTION III.,"""Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;"
606,SECTION III.,And what their errand may be I know no better than others.
607,SECTION III.,Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention                   295
608,SECTION III.,"Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?"""
609,SECTION III.,"""God's name!"" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;"
610,SECTION III.,"""Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?"
611,SECTION III.,"Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!"""
612,SECTION III.,"But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,--         300"
613,SECTION III.,"""Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice"
614,SECTION III.,"Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,"
615,SECTION III.,"When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal."""
616,SECTION III.,"This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it"
617,SECTION III.,When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.         305
618,SECTION III.,"""Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,"
619,SECTION III.,"Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statute of Justice"
620,SECTION III.,"Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,"
621,SECTION III.,"And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided"
622,SECTION III.,"Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.      310"
623,SECTION III.,"Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,"
624,SECTION III.,Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.
625,SECTION III.,But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;
626,SECTION III.,"Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty"
627,SECTION III.,Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace          315
628,SECTION III.,"That a necklace of pearls was lost, and ere long a suspicion"
629,SECTION III.,Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.
630,SECTION III.,"She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,"
631,SECTION III.,Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.
632,SECTION III.,"As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,                320"
633,SECTION III.,Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder
634,SECTION III.,"Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand"
635,SECTION III.,"Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,"
636,SECTION III.,"And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,"
637,SECTION III.,"Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven.""        325"
638,SECTION III.,"Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith"
639,SECTION III.,"Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;"
640,SECTION III.,"All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors"
641,SECTION III.,Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.
642,SECTION III.,
643,SECTION III.,"Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,                 330"
644,SECTION III.,"Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed"
645,SECTION III.,"Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre;"
646,SECTION III.,"While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,"
647,SECTION III.,"Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,"
648,SECTION III.,Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.         335
649,SECTION III.,"Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,"
650,SECTION III.,And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.
651,SECTION III.,Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
652,SECTION III.,Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;
653,SECTION III.,"And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and bridegroom,           340"
654,SECTION III.,Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.
655,SECTION III.,"Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,"
656,SECTION III.,"While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,"
657,SECTION III.,Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.
658,SECTION III.,Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men             345
659,SECTION III.,"Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuvre,"
660,SECTION III.,"Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row."
661,SECTION III.,"Meanwhile, apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,"
662,SECTION III.,"Sat the lovers and whispered together, beholding the moon rise"
663,SECTION III.,Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.                350
664,SECTION III.,
665,SECTION III.,"Silently, one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,"
666,SECTION III.,"Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels."
667,SECTION III.,
668,SECTION III.,Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry
669,SECTION III.,"Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway"
670,SECTION III.,Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.     355
671,SECTION III.,Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step
672,SECTION III.,"Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness."
673,SECTION III.,"Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,"
674,SECTION III.,And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.
675,SECTION III.,Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.             360
676,SECTION III.,"Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,"
677,SECTION III.,Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.
678,SECTION III.,"Silent she passed through the hall, and entered the door of her chamber."
679,SECTION III.,"Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press"
680,SECTION III.,"Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded         365"
681,SECTION III.,"Linen and woolen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven"
682,SECTION III.,"This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,"
683,SECTION III.,"Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife."
684,SECTION III.,"Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight"
685,SECTION III.,"Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden 370"
686,SECTION III.,"Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean."
687,SECTION III.,"Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with"
688,SECTION III.,Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!
689,SECTION III.,"Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,"
690,SECTION III.,Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.  375
691,SECTION III.,"Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness"
692,SECTION III.,"Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight"
693,SECTION III.,Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.
694,SECTION III.,"And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass"
695,SECTION III.,"Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,     380"
696,SECTION III.,As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar.
697,SECTION III.,
698,SECTION III.,
699,SECTION IV.,SECTION IV.
700,SECTION IV.,
701,SECTION IV.,Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre.
702,SECTION IV.,"Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,"
703,SECTION IV.,"Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor."
704,SECTION IV.,"Life had been long astir in the village, and clamorous labor            385"
705,SECTION IV.,Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.
706,SECTION IV.,"Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,"
707,SECTION IV.,Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.
708,SECTION IV.,Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
709,SECTION IV.,"Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,          390"
710,SECTION IV.,"Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,"
711,SECTION IV.,"Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway."
712,SECTION IV.,"Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced."
713,SECTION IV.,Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors
714,SECTION IV.,"Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together.            395"
715,SECTION IV.,"Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;"
716,SECTION IV.,"For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,"
717,SECTION IV.,"All things were held in common, and what one had was another's."
718,SECTION IV.,Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant:
719,SECTION IV.,For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father.                    400
720,SECTION IV.,"Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness"
721,SECTION IV.,"Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it."
722,SECTION IV.,
723,SECTION IV.,"Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,"
724,SECTION IV.,"Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal."
725,SECTION IV.,There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;  405
726,SECTION IV.,"There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith."
727,SECTION IV.,"Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider press and the bee-hives,"
728,SECTION IV.,"Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats."
729,SECTION IV.,Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white
730,SECTION IV.,"Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler        410"
731,SECTION IV.,Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.
732,SECTION IV.,"Gaily the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,"
733,SECTION IV.,"_Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres_, and _Le Carillon de Dunkerque_,"
734,SECTION IV.,And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.
735,SECTION IV.,"Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances              415"
736,SECTION IV.,Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;
737,SECTION IV.,"Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them."
738,SECTION IV.,"Fairest of all maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter!"
739,SECTION IV.,"Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!"
740,SECTION IV.,
741,SECTION IV.,So passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous           420
742,SECTION IV.,"Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat."
743,SECTION IV.,"Thronged ere long was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,"
744,SECTION IV.,"Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones"
745,SECTION IV.,Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.
746,SECTION IV.,"Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them     425"
747,SECTION IV.,Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor
748,SECTION IV.,"Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,--"
749,SECTION IV.,"Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal"
750,SECTION IV.,"Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers."
751,SECTION IV.,"Then uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar,     430"
752,SECTION IV.,"Holding aloft in his hands, with the seals, the royal commission."
753,SECTION IV.,"""You are convened this day,"" he said, ""by his Majesty's orders."
754,SECTION IV.,Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness
755,SECTION IV.,Let your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper
756,SECTION IV.,"Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.         435"
757,SECTION IV.,"Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch:"
758,SECTION IV.,"Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds"
759,SECTION IV.,Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province
760,SECTION IV.,Be transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there
761,SECTION IV.,"Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!                440"
762,SECTION IV.,"Prisoners now I declare you, for such is his Majesty's pleasure!"""
763,SECTION IV.,"As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,"
764,SECTION IV.,"Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones"
765,SECTION IV.,"Beats down the farmer's corn in the field, and shatters his windows,"
766,SECTION IV.,"Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs, 445"
767,SECTION IV.,"Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;"
768,SECTION IV.,So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.
769,SECTION IV.,"Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose"
770,SECTION IV.,"Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,"
771,SECTION IV.,"And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way.           450"
772,SECTION IV.,Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations
773,SECTION IV.,Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others
774,SECTION IV.,"Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,"
775,SECTION IV.,"As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows."
776,SECTION IV.,"Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,--  455"
777,SECTION IV.,"""Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!"
778,SECTION IV.,"Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!"""
779,SECTION IV.,"More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier"
780,SECTION IV.,"Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement."
781,SECTION IV.,
782,SECTION IV.,"In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,            460"
783,SECTION IV.,"Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician"
784,SECTION IV.,"Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar."
785,SECTION IV.,"Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence"
786,SECTION IV.,All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;
787,SECTION IV.,Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful        465
788,SECTION IV.,"Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes."
789,SECTION IV.,"""What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?"
790,SECTION IV.,"Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,"
791,SECTION IV.,"Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!"
792,SECTION IV.,"Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations? 470"
793,SECTION IV.,Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?
794,SECTION IV.,"This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it"
795,SECTION IV.,Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?
796,SECTION IV.,Lo! where the crucified Christ from His cross is gazing upon you!
797,SECTION IV.,See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!         475
798,SECTION IV.,"Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, 'O Father, forgive them!'"
799,SECTION IV.,"Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,"
800,SECTION IV.,"Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father, forgive them!'"""
801,SECTION IV.,"Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people"
802,SECTION IV.,"Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,    480"
803,SECTION IV.,"While they repeated his prayer and said, ""O Father, forgive them!"""
804,SECTION IV.,
805,SECTION IV.,Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar;
806,SECTION IV.,"Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest, and the people responded,"
807,SECTION IV.,"Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria"
808,SECTION IV.,"Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated, 485"
809,SECTION IV.,"Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven."
810,SECTION IV.,
811,SECTION IV.,"Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides"
812,SECTION IV.,"Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children."
813,SECTION IV.,"Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand"
814,SECTION IV.,"Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,    490"
815,SECTION IV.,"Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each"
816,SECTION IV.,"Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows."
817,SECTION IV.,Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;
818,SECTION IV.,"There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild flowers;"
819,SECTION IV.,"There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy; 495"
820,SECTION IV.,And at the head of the board the great arm-chair of the farmer.
821,SECTION IV.,"Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset"
822,SECTION IV.,Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows.
823,SECTION IV.,"Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,"
824,SECTION IV.,"And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,--       500"
825,SECTION IV.,"Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience!"
826,SECTION IV.,"Then, all forgetful of self, she wandered into the village,"
827,SECTION IV.,"Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,"
828,SECTION IV.,"As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,"
829,SECTION IV.,"Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.   505"
830,SECTION IV.,"Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors"
831,SECTION IV.,"Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai."
832,SECTION IV.,Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.
833,SECTION IV.,
834,SECTION IV.,"Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered."
835,SECTION IV.,All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows          510
836,SECTION IV.,"Stood she, and listened and looked, until, overcome by emotion"
837,SECTION IV.,"""Gabriel!"" cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer"
838,SECTION IV.,"Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living."
839,SECTION IV.,Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.
840,SECTION IV.,"Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted. 515"
841,SECTION IV.,"Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror."
842,SECTION IV.,Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.
843,SECTION IV.,In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall
844,SECTION IV.,Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.
845,SECTION IV.,Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder      520
846,SECTION IV.,Told her that God was in heaven and governed the world He created!
847,SECTION IV.,Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;
848,SECTION IV.,"Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning."
849,SECTION IV.,
850,SECTION IV.,
851,SECTION V.,SECTION V.
852,SECTION V.,
853,SECTION V.,
854,SECTION V.,Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day
855,SECTION V.,Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm-house.       525
856,SECTION V.,"Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession,"
857,SECTION V.,"Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,"
858,SECTION V.,"Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,"
859,SECTION V.,"Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,"
860,SECTION V.,Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.     530
861,SECTION V.,"Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,"
862,SECTION V.,While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.
863,SECTION V.,
864,SECTION V.,Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach
865,SECTION V.,Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants.
866,SECTION V.,All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;         535
867,SECTION V.,All day long the wains came laboring down from the village.
868,SECTION V.,"Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,"
869,SECTION V.,Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.
870,SECTION V.,Thither the women and children thronged. On a sudden the church-doors
871,SECTION V.,"Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession     540"
872,SECTION V.,"Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers."
873,SECTION V.,"Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,"
874,SECTION V.,"Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,"
875,SECTION V.,So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended
876,SECTION V.,"Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters. 545"
877,SECTION V.,"Foremost the young men came; and raising together their voices,"
878,SECTION V.,Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:--
879,SECTION V.,"""Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain!"
880,SECTION V.,"Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!"""
881,SECTION V.,"Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside 550"
882,SECTION V.,"Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them"
883,SECTION V.,"Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed."
884,SECTION V.,
885,SECTION V.,"Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,"
886,SECTION V.,"Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,--"
887,SECTION V.,"Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,       555"
888,SECTION V.,And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.
889,SECTION V.,"Tears then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him,"
890,SECTION V.,"Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,--"
891,SECTION V.,"""Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another"
892,SECTION V.,"Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!""        560"
893,SECTION V.,"Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father"
894,SECTION V.,"Saw she, slowly advancing. Alas! how changed was his aspect!"
895,SECTION V.,"Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep"
896,SECTION V.,Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.
897,SECTION V.,"But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,     565"
898,SECTION V.,Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.
899,SECTION V.,Thus to the Gasperau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.
900,SECTION V.,
901,SECTION V.,"There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking."
902,SECTION V.,Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion
903,SECTION V.,"Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children 570"
904,SECTION V.,"Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties."
905,SECTION V.,"So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,"
906,SECTION V.,While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.
907,SECTION V.,"Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight"
908,SECTION V.,Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean           575
909,SECTION V.,"Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach"
910,SECTION V.,"Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed."
911,SECTION V.,"Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,"
912,SECTION V.,"Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,"
913,SECTION V.,"All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,             580"
914,SECTION V.,Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.
915,SECTION V.,"Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,"
916,SECTION V.,"Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving"
917,SECTION V.,Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.
918,SECTION V.,"Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures,   585"
919,SECTION V.,Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders
920,SECTION V.,"Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,--"
921,SECTION V.,Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.
922,SECTION V.,"Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,"
923,SECTION V.,"Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows.   590"
924,SECTION V.,
925,SECTION V.,"But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,"
926,SECTION V.,Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.
927,SECTION V.,"Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,"
928,SECTION V.,"Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children."
929,SECTION V.,"Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,       595"
930,SECTION V.,"Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,"
931,SECTION V.,Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore.
932,SECTION V.,"Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,"
933,SECTION V.,"And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,"
934,SECTION V.,"Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,      600"
935,SECTION V.,E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.
936,SECTION V.,"Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,"
937,SECTION V.,"Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not,"
938,SECTION V.,"But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light."
939,SECTION V.,"_Benedicite!_ murmured the priest, in tones of compassion.         605"
940,SECTION V.,"More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents"
941,SECTION V.,"Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,"
942,SECTION V.,"Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow."
943,SECTION V.,"Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,"
944,SECTION V.,Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them            610
945,SECTION V.,"Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals."
946,SECTION V.,"Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence."
947,SECTION V.,
948,SECTION V.,"Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red"
949,SECTION V.,"Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon"

1259,SECTION III.,"Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.            900"
1260,SECTION III.,Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine
1261,SECTION III.,"Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,"
1262,SECTION III.,"And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding"
1263,SECTION III.,"Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose."
1264,SECTION III.,"In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway           905"
1265,SECTION III.,"Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,"
1266,SECTION III.,Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.
1267,SECTION III.,"Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas"
1268,SECTION III.,"Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,"
1269,SECTION III.,"Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines.           910"
1270,SECTION III.,
1271,SECTION III.,"Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,"
1272,SECTION III.,"Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,"
1273,SECTION III.,"Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin."
1274,SECTION III.,Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero
1275,SECTION III.,"Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.        915"
1276,SECTION III.,Round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing
1277,SECTION III.,"Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness"
1278,SECTION III.,"That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape."
1279,SECTION III.,"Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding"
1280,SECTION III.,"Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded            920"
1281,SECTION III.,"Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening."
1282,SECTION III.,Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
1283,SECTION III.,Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.
1284,SECTION III.,"Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,"
1285,SECTION III.,"And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.             925"
1286,SECTION III.,"Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden"
1287,SECTION III.,Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.
1288,SECTION III.,"Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward"
1289,SECTION III.,Pushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;
1290,SECTION III.,"When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.        930"
1291,SECTION III.,"Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden."
1292,SECTION III.,There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
1293,SECTION III.,"Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,"
1294,SECTION III.,"Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful."
1295,SECTION III.,"Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings    935"
1296,SECTION III.,"Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,"
1297,SECTION III.,"Broke the silence and said, ""If you came by the Atchafalaya,"
1298,SECTION III.,"How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?"""
1299,SECTION III.,Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.
1300,SECTION III.,"Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,        940"
1301,SECTION III.,"""Gone? is Gabriel gone?"" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,"
1302,SECTION III.,"All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented."
1303,SECTION III.,"Then the good Basil said,--and his voice grew blithe as he said it,--"
1304,SECTION III.,"""Be of good cheer, my child; it is only today he departed."
1305,SECTION III.,Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.          945
1306,SECTION III.,"Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit"
1307,SECTION III.,Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.
1308,SECTION III.,"Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,"
1309,SECTION III.,"Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,"
1310,SECTION III.,"He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,               950"
1311,SECTION III.,"Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him"
1312,SECTION III.,Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.
1313,SECTION III.,"Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,"
1314,SECTION III.,"Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver."
1315,SECTION III.,Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;          955
1316,SECTION III.,"He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him."
1317,SECTION III.,"Up and away tomorrow, and through the red dew of the morning,"
1318,SECTION III.,"We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison."""
1319,SECTION III.,
1320,SECTION III.,"Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,"
1321,SECTION III.,"Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.            960"
1322,SECTION III.,"Long under Basil's roof had he lived, like a god on Olympus,"
1323,SECTION III.,Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.
1324,SECTION III.,Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.
1325,SECTION III.,"""Long live Michael,"" they cried, ""our brave Acadian minstrel!"""
1326,SECTION III.,As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway         965
1327,SECTION III.,"Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man"
1328,SECTION III.,"Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,"
1329,SECTION III.,"Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,"
1330,SECTION III.,"Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters."
1331,SECTION III.,"Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the ci-devant blacksmith,      970"
1332,SECTION III.,"All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;"
1333,SECTION III.,"Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,"
1334,SECTION III.,"And of the prairies, whose numberless herds were his who would take them;"
1335,SECTION III.,"Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise."
1336,SECTION III.,"Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,         975"
1337,SECTION III.,"Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil"
1338,SECTION III.,Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.
1339,SECTION III.,
1340,SECTION III.,Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.
1341,SECTION III.,"All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,"
1342,SECTION III.,"Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,         980"
1343,SECTION III.,"Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight."
1344,SECTION III.,"Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman"
1345,SECTION III.,Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.
1346,SECTION III.,"Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,"
1347,SECTION III.,"Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:-- 985"
1348,SECTION III.,"""Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,"
1349,SECTION III.,"Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!"
1350,SECTION III.,Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;
1351,SECTION III.,Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer;
1352,SECTION III.,"Smoothly the plowshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water. 990"
1353,SECTION III.,All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows
1354,SECTION III.,More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.
1355,SECTION III.,"Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;"
1356,SECTION III.,"Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber"
1357,SECTION III.,With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.            995
1358,SECTION III.,"After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests,"
1359,SECTION III.,"No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,"
1360,SECTION III.,"Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle."""
1361,SECTION III.,"Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,"
1362,SECTION III.,"While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,          1000"
1363,SECTION III.,"So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,"
1364,SECTION III.,"Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils."
1365,SECTION III.,"But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:--"
1366,SECTION III.,"""Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!"
1367,SECTION III.,"For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,                   1005"
1368,SECTION III.,"Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!"""
1369,SECTION III.,"Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching"
1370,SECTION III.,Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.
1371,SECTION III.,"It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,"
1372,SECTION III.,Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the herdsman.          1010
1373,SECTION III.,Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:
1374,SECTION III.,"Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,"
1375,SECTION III.,"Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,"
1376,SECTION III.,Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.
1377,SECTION III.,"But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding              1015"
1378,SECTION III.,"From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,"
1379,SECTION III.,"Broke up all further speech. Away, like children delighted,"
1380,SECTION III.,"All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening"
1381,SECTION III.,"Whirl of the dizzy dance as it swept and swayed to the music,"
1382,SECTION III.,"Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.      1020"
1383,SECTION III.,
1384,SECTION III.,"Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman"
1385,SECTION III.,"Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;"
1386,SECTION III.,"While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her"
1387,SECTION III.,"Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music"
1388,SECTION III.,"Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness           1025"
1389,SECTION III.,"Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden."
1390,SECTION III.,"Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest,"
1391,SECTION III.,"Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river"
1392,SECTION III.,"Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,"
1393,SECTION III.,Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.      1030
1394,SECTION III.,"Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden"
1395,SECTION III.,"Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions"
1396,SECTION III.,"Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian."
1397,SECTION III.,"Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,"
1398,SECTION III.,Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical moonlight       1035
1399,SECTION III.,"Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longings,"
1400,SECTION III.,"As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,"
1401,SECTION III.,Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.
1402,SECTION III.,"Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies"
1403,SECTION III.,Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.            1040
1404,SECTION III.,"Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,"
1405,SECTION III.,"Shone on the eyes of man, who had ceased to marvel and worship,"
1406,SECTION III.,"Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,"
1407,SECTION III.,"As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, ""Upharsin."""
1408,SECTION III.,"And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,      1045"
1409,SECTION III.,"Wandered alone, and she cried, ""O Gabriel! O my beloved!"
1410,SECTION III.,"Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?"
1411,SECTION III.,"Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?"
1412,SECTION III.,Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!
1413,SECTION III.,Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!       1050
1414,SECTION III.,"Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,"
1415,SECTION III.,"Thou hast lain down to rest, and to dream of me in thy slumbers!"
1416,SECTION III.,"When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?"""
1417,SECTION III.,Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
1418,SECTION III.,"Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets, 1055"
1419,SECTION III.,Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.
1420,SECTION III.,"""Patience!"" whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness;"
1421,SECTION III.,"And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, ""To-morrow!"""
1422,SECTION III.,
1423,SECTION III.,Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden
1424,SECTION III.,"Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses     1060"
1425,SECTION III.,With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.
1426,SECTION III.,"""Farewell!"" said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;"
1427,SECTION III.,"""See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,"
1428,SECTION III.,"And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming."""
1429,SECTION III.,"""Farewell!"" answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended    1065"
1430,SECTION III.,"Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting."
1431,SECTION III.,"Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,"
1432,SECTION III.,"Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,"
1433,SECTION III.,Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.
1434,SECTION III.,"Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,            1070"
1435,SECTION III.,"Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,"
1436,SECTION III.,"Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain"
1437,SECTION III.,Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country;
1438,SECTION III.,"Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,"
1439,SECTION III.,"Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord 1075"
1440,SECTION III.,"That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,"
1441,SECTION III.,"Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies."
1442,SECTION III.,
1443,SECTION III.,
1444,SECTION IV,SECTION IV
1445,SECTION IV,
1446,SECTION IV,
1447,SECTION IV,"Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains"
1448,SECTION IV,"Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits."
1449,SECTION IV,"Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway, 1080"
1450,SECTION IV,"Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,"
1451,SECTION IV,Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee.
1452,SECTION IV,"Eastward, with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains,"
1453,SECTION IV,Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska;
1454,SECTION IV,"And to the south, from Fontaine-quibout and the Spanish sierras,       1085"
1455,SECTION IV,"Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert,"
1456,SECTION IV,"Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean,"
1457,SECTION IV,"Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations."
1458,SECTION IV,"Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies,"
1459,SECTION IV,"Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,             1090"
1460,SECTION IV,Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.
1461,SECTION IV,"Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk, and the roebuck;"
1462,SECTION IV,"Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;"
1463,SECTION IV,"Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;"
1464,SECTION IV,"Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,           1095"
1465,SECTION IV,Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails
1466,SECTION IV,"Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,"
1467,SECTION IV,"Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,"
1468,SECTION IV,By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.
1469,SECTION IV,Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;   1100
1470,SECTION IV,Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;
1471,SECTION IV,"And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,"
1472,SECTION IV,"Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,"
1473,SECTION IV,"And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,"
1474,SECTION IV,Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.                   1105
1475,SECTION IV,
1476,SECTION IV,"Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains,"
1477,SECTION IV,"Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him."
1478,SECTION IV,"Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil"
1479,SECTION IV,"Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him."
1480,SECTION IV,"Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire    1110"
1481,SECTION IV,"Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,"
1482,SECTION IV,"When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes."
1483,SECTION IV,"And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,"
1484,SECTION IV,"Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana"
1485,SECTION IV,"Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them. 1115"
1486,SECTION IV,
1487,SECTION IV,"Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered"
1488,SECTION IV,"Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features"
1489,SECTION IV,"Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow."
1490,SECTION IV,"She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,"
1491,SECTION IV,"From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,               1120"
1492,SECTION IV,"Where her Canadian husband, a coureur-des-bois, had been murdered."
1493,SECTION IV,"Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome"
1494,SECTION IV,"Gave they, the words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them"
1495,SECTION IV,On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.
1496,SECTION IV,"But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,        1125"
1497,SECTION IV,"Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,"
1498,SECTION IV,"Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light"
1499,SECTION IV,"Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets,"
1500,SECTION IV,Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated
1501,SECTION IV,"Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,      1130"
1502,SECTION IV,"All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses."
1503,SECTION IV,"Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another"
1504,SECTION IV,Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.
1505,SECTION IV,"Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,"
1506,SECTION IV,"Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,      1135"
1507,SECTION IV,She in turn related her love and all its disasters.
1508,SECTION IV,"Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended"
1509,SECTION IV,"Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror"
1510,SECTION IV,"Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;"
1511,SECTION IV,"Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden.            1140"
1512,SECTION IV,"But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,"
1513,SECTION IV,"Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,"
1514,SECTION IV,"Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest."
1515,SECTION IV,"Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,"
1516,SECTION IV,"Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,     1145"
1517,SECTION IV,"That, through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,"
1518,SECTION IV,"Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,"
1519,SECTION IV,"Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,"
1520,SECTION IV,"And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people."
1521,SECTION IV,"Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened           1150"
1522,SECTION IV,"To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her"
1523,SECTION IV,"Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress."
1524,SECTION IV,"Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,"
1525,SECTION IV,"Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor"
1526,SECTION IV,"Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.    1155"
1527,SECTION IV,"With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches"
1528,SECTION IV,Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.
1529,SECTION IV,"Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,"
1530,SECTION IV,"Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,"
1531,SECTION IV,"As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.      1160"
1532,SECTION IV,It was no earthly fear. A breath from the region of spirits
1533,SECTION IV,Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment
1534,SECTION IV,"That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom."
1535,SECTION IV,"With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished."
1536,SECTION IV,"Early upon the morrow the march was resumed, and the Shawnee           1165"
1537,SECTION IV,"Said, as they journeyed along,--""On the western slope of these mountains"
1538,SECTION IV,Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.
1539,SECTION IV,"Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;"
1540,SECTION IV,"Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him."""
1541,SECTION IV,"Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,           1170"
1542,SECTION IV,"""Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!"""
1543,SECTION IV,"Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,"
1544,SECTION IV,"Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,"
1545,SECTION IV,"And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,"
1546,SECTION IV,"Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.      1175"
1547,SECTION IV,"Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,"
1548,SECTION IV,Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A crucifix fastened
1549,SECTION IV,"High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines,"
1550,SECTION IV,Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.
1551,SECTION IV,"This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the intricate arches       1180"
1552,SECTION IV,"Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,"
1553,SECTION IV,Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.
1554,SECTION IV,"Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,"
1555,SECTION IV,"Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions."

2103,ARGUMENT.,"""Evangeline"" is usually studied in the seventh school year--a time when a"
2104,ARGUMENT.,somewhat intensive study of a piece of literature may be undertaken with
2105,ARGUMENT.,profit. This poem offers a most delightful introduction into the wider
2106,ARGUMENT.,realms of literature--an introduction fraught with much consequence since
2107,ARGUMENT.,the manner of it is likely to have a considerable bearing on the pupil's
2108,ARGUMENT.,future in this subject. It is certainly important that the most be made of
2109,ARGUMENT.,the opportunity.
2110,ARGUMENT.,
2111,ARGUMENT.,We believe that the common lack of interest and effort in school work
2112,ARGUMENT.,"is often due to an absence of definite and visible ends, and of proper"
2113,ARGUMENT.,"directions for the reaching of those ends. Pupils do not object to work, and"
2114,ARGUMENT.,"hard work, with something tangible. What they do object to is groping in"
2115,ARGUMENT.,the dark for something that may turn up--which is too frequently the case
2116,ARGUMENT.,in their study of a piece of literature. Such a course may be commendable
2117,ARGUMENT.,"later, but at this period, suggestion and direction are necessary. These are"
2118,ARGUMENT.,"furnished by our ""Suggestive Questions,"" which indicate lines of study and"
2119,ARGUMENT.,research.
2120,ARGUMENT.,
2121,ARGUMENT.,In the ordinary reading class the work is largely done by a few of the
2122,ARGUMENT.,brighter pupils. It is quite difficult to secure a careful preparation by
2123,ARGUMENT.,the whole class. It is also difficult to ascertain how well the pupils are
2124,ARGUMENT.,"prepared. The ""Suggestive Questions"" will be found very helpful here."
2125,ARGUMENT.,
2126,ARGUMENT.,Care has been exercised in the division of the subject matter that each
2127,ARGUMENT.,"lesson may, in a sense, be complete in itself. The lessons are supposed to"
2128,ARGUMENT.,"occupy twenty-five or thirty minutes; this, with the nature of the subject"
2129,ARGUMENT.,"matter and the number of unfamiliar words, determining the length of the"
2130,ARGUMENT.,lessons.
2131,ARGUMENT.,
2132,ARGUMENT.,The poem is to be studied twice:--
2133,ARGUMENT.,
2134,ARGUMENT.,"First, a general survey to get the story and the characters clearly in mind."
2135,ARGUMENT.,
2136,ARGUMENT.,"Second, a careful study of the text that the beauty and richness, the"
2137,ARGUMENT.,artistic and ethical values of the poem may be realized.
2138,ARGUMENT.,
2139,ARGUMENT.,"It is obvious that no scheme, however carefully wrought out, can in any"
2140,ARGUMENT.,"sense be a substitute for earnestness, enthusiasm and sympathy; and careful"
2141,ARGUMENT.,"preparation is an absolute essential of all successful teaching. With these,"
2142,ARGUMENT.,"it is believed, excellent results may be secured by use of this plan."

2741,SEC. V.,she finally give up hope? Explain lines 1270-1275. What made the world look
2742,SEC. V.,bright to her? Does one's state of mind determine to a large extent how the
2743,SEC. V.,world looks? Does the world look the same at night and in the morning? When
2744,SEC. V.,are we most likely to see it as it is? Was Gabriel forgotten? What were the
2745,SEC. V.,lessons her life had taught her? What became of her love? How did she act
2746,SEC. V.,practically upon her feeling? What was the word or the thing that drew her?
2747,SEC. V.,She shows what quality 1291-1293? What is a Sister of Mercy? Why had she
2748,SEC. V.,not joined the Order before? Had she in a true sense been a sister of mercy

3460,XXXIV,Transcriber's notes:
3461,XXXIV,
3462,XXXIV,1. The poem has been compared with another version already on Gutenberg--
3463,XXXIV,"(vngln10). Where the two disagreed, this text was carefully re-checked to"
3464,XXXIV,ensure the text and punctuation matched those on the scanned image.
3465,XXXIV,
3466,XXXIV,2. The following apparent errors in the source text were corrected:
3467,XXXIV,
3468,XXXIV,Poem Line 73 'bessings' changed to blessings. 346 'manoeuvre': the oe
3469,XXXIV,ligature was split. 668 'goods' changed to Gods. 692 full stop added to line
3470,XXXIV,end. 718 'father-confessor': hyphen added. 840 'their' changed to there. 850
3471,XXXIV,'reverened' changed to reverend. 909 'spar' changed to spars. 909 'tropcis'
3472,XXXIV,changed to tropics. 1083 'rivre' changed to river. 1256 'reecho' changed to
3473,XXXIV,re-echo.
3474,XXXIV,
3475,XXXIV,2. Line 713 has been copied and inserted from vgln10. This was missing in
3476,XXXIV,"the book, but was referenced in the notes; the line numbering also showed a"
3477,XXXIV,missing line between 710 and 715.
3478,XXXIV,
3479,XXXIV,3. No other (deliberate) changes have made to the poem. There remain a
