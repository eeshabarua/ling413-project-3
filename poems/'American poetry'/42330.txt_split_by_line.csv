123,THE DAYS,
124,THE DAYS,A long grim corridor--a sullen bar
125,THE DAYS,Of light athwart the darkness--where no fleet
126,THE DAYS,Pale sunshine spreads for dark his winding sheet
127,THE DAYS,"A light, not born of noon nor placid star"
128,THE DAYS,"Glows lurid thro' the gloom--while from afar,"
129,THE DAYS,Beats marching of innumerable feet.
130,THE DAYS,Is this the place where tragic armies meet?
131,THE DAYS,The throb of terror that presages war?--
132,THE DAYS,"I strain to see, then softly on my sight"
133,THE DAYS,"There falls the vision, manifold they come--"
134,THE DAYS,White listless Day chained to her brother Night--
135,THE DAYS,"Their hands are shackled and their lips are dumb,"
136,THE DAYS,"And as they meet the air where each one dies,"
137,THE DAYS,They turn and smile at me--with weary eyes.

146,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,That poise so lightly on the mountains' crest--
147,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,A lily laid to cheer its lonely breast--
148,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,"Shall their chill smile still face the wind, that blows"
149,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,"Across the field whereon no blossom grows,"
150,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,And light the land where no gay life may rest
151,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,"Save glowing hasty fingers of the West,"
152,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,When our two hearts lie cold beneath the rose?
153,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,"These silver flakes of ancient hoary frost,"
154,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,"Surviving all our joys' supremest powers,"
155,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,And though the petals of your lips be lost
156,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,"And gone the summer of your golden head,"

158,THE EVERLASTING SNOWS,Shall still live on--though our sweet love be dead.

166,THRONE AND ALTAR,He had a vision of a golden throne
167,THRONE AND ALTAR,"Fronting an altar; both alike were bare,"
168,THRONE AND ALTAR,But o'er the purple of the regal chair
169,THRONE AND ALTAR,"Blazed the device, ""I wait for him alone"
170,THRONE AND ALTAR,"Who with the world has held his soul his own."""
171,THRONE AND ALTAR,"He sadly turned, this height he could not dare."
172,THRONE AND ALTAR,But--Stay--the text upon the altar there--
173,THRONE AND ALTAR,"""I wait for him who has not made a moan"
174,THRONE AND ALTAR,Howe'er his kind have used his heaven-sent dower.
175,THRONE AND ALTAR,"Fear not, and burn thine incense, lowly heart."""
176,THRONE AND ALTAR,"And sudden brightness turns the averted face,"
177,THRONE AND ALTAR,To holy sense of majesty and power--

188,EAST AND WEST,Laid our two paths apart; when in the West
189,EAST AND WEST,"She gave you over to the seas, and great"
190,EAST AND WEST,"Wide winds of enterprise, and set your breast"
191,EAST AND WEST,Against the suns and shadows of the earth;
192,EAST AND WEST,"Then with a gilded largess, led my ways"
193,EAST AND WEST,"Toward the time-worn East, who paints her dearth"
194,EAST AND WEST,With purple vain imaginings; the praise
195,EAST AND WEST,Of all her languid incense and the pride
196,EAST AND WEST,Of ancient mysteries and hopeless creeds
197,EAST AND WEST,Hold for my heart no spell when warm and wide
198,EAST AND WEST,I see across the blue of Isis' veil

211,THE BATTLE,"Grey deep sea waves that never knew the land,"
212,THE BATTLE,"Tired with the tumult, stretch a crooked hand"
213,THE BATTLE,"To win a precious sweet surcease from pain,"
214,THE BATTLE,"But, glancing back upon the mighty main,"
215,THE BATTLE,Perforce return to swell the strong command.
216,THE BATTLE,So fretful Life sees Death's cold sands and faints
217,THE BATTLE,"To fling thereon the wearing of her wave,"
218,THE BATTLE,"Yet, turning ere she finds the gloomy shore,"

229,WATER AND WINE,I asked for water and they brought me wine;
230,WATER AND WINE,"Wine in a jewelled chalice, where the gold"
231,WATER AND WINE,"Gleamed thro' the purple beads, as if unrolled--"
232,WATER AND WINE,One saw the sun-rays of a life-time shine.
233,WATER AND WINE,"So drinking, I forgot my dream divine"
234,WATER AND WINE,"Of crystal purity, for in my hold"
235,WATER AND WINE,Were wealth and Fame and Passions manifold
236,WATER AND WINE,Which with the draught I fancied might be mine.
237,WATER AND WINE,
238,WATER AND WINE,"""Ah, Youth,"" I said, ""Ah, Faith and Love!"" I said;"
239,WATER AND WINE,"""These are but broken lances in the strife!"

274,A DREAM IN FEVER,"An orange purple halo 'round the rain,"
275,A DREAM IN FEVER,Twists from a space whose very size is pain.
276,A DREAM IN FEVER,Here in this vortex day with night combines;
277,A DREAM IN FEVER,Ruby and Emerald glint their blazing spines;
278,A DREAM IN FEVER,"Closing and smothering, wheels a brazen main,"
279,A DREAM IN FEVER,A shuddering sea of silence; in its train
280,A DREAM IN FEVER,"A Thought--a cry, whose snake--fear trembling twines"
281,A DREAM IN FEVER,Around--above--alive yet uttered not;

296,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,"Across the rain forlorn and hopelessly,"
297,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,"Nor starting, think 'tis he that draws so near."
298,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,I will forget how tenderly and dear
299,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,"He might in coming hold his arms to me,"
300,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,For I will prove what woman's pride can be
301,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,When faint love lingers in the darkness drear.
302,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,"I will not--Ah, but should he come to-night"
303,A WOMAN'S PRIDE,"I think my life might break thro' very bliss,"

768,DEAR DEAD WOMEN,Pity that things so fair in death must lie;
769,DEAR DEAD WOMEN,But Winter holds and kills her with a sigh.

1284,IN THE GRAVE,Dear Love--do you wake in that land where my waking is done?
1285,IN THE GRAVE,Do you bare your brave head to the winds and the clouds and the sun?
1286,IN THE GRAVE,And is Summer aflame?
1287,IN THE GRAVE,"Or has the night fallen to sleep on earth's wonderful breast,"
1288,IN THE GRAVE,"And with it, all joys, save but you, who are dearest and best,"
1289,IN THE GRAVE,Wakeful--sighing my name?
1290,IN THE GRAVE,
1291,IN THE GRAVE,"Sometimes as I sleep, the sweet rain flickers over my head,"
1292,IN THE GRAVE,"And smiling, I dream of the tears that your sorrow has shed;"
1293,IN THE GRAVE,Then I sigh and awake.
1294,IN THE GRAVE,For the dreams of the grave are the dreams that have died
1295,IN THE GRAVE,"in the morn,"
1296,IN THE GRAVE,And their ghosts alone haunt the cold earth where their maker
1297,IN THE GRAVE,"was born,"
1298,IN THE GRAVE,For a woman's sweet sake.
1299,IN THE GRAVE,
1300,IN THE GRAVE,Perhaps you are singing--and winding the garlands of May;
1301,IN THE GRAVE,"Not mine be the hand to withhold you the golden to-day,"
1302,IN THE GRAVE,Or give you pause to your song.
1303,IN THE GRAVE,Perhaps the sweet blossoms may charm the grave's pestilent breath.
1304,IN THE GRAVE,"Ah! life is so short; so forget and be glad, dear--for death"
1305,IN THE GRAVE,Is so terribly long.

1314,PROSERPINE,The jewels of the sun are not more rare
1315,PROSERPINE,Than these that lie upon my lurid halls.
1316,PROSERPINE,The perfume kiss upon the drowsy air
1317,PROSERPINE,Is sweet as Spring can hold within her walls.
1318,PROSERPINE,The spell which night may cast upon her thralls
1319,PROSERPINE,Is mine; the length of all this gloomy land
1320,PROSERPINE,Knows no more sun than falls from my white hand.
1321,PROSERPINE,
1322,PROSERPINE,"My wealth great kings have prayed for--in their pride,"
1323,PROSERPINE,Bowing before me. Nay--I hate the place.
1324,PROSERPINE,I am no queen at heart--my laughter died
1325,PROSERPINE,That I might wear my crown with regal grace
1326,PROSERPINE,The very flowers which smile on my sad face
1327,PROSERPINE,I am afraid of. See! they are the worst
1328,PROSERPINE,Of all my fears; so fair--yet black accurst.
1329,PROSERPINE,
1330,PROSERPINE,The languid passion-poppy sways and dips
1331,PROSERPINE,To show the black heart bursting into flame.
1332,PROSERPINE,The crimson evil of a satyr's lips
1333,PROSERPINE,A sneering nodding finger-post of shame;
1334,PROSERPINE,A thousand other flowers without a name
1335,PROSERPINE,Huddle all trembling in the dusk behind
1336,PROSERPINE,"Like hunted ghosts, whose eyes are white and blind."
1337,PROSERPINE,
1338,PROSERPINE,The grass is not the grass that overhead
1339,PROSERPINE,Cooled my bare feet with daisies' purest snows;
1340,PROSERPINE,"But thick pale blades, like fingers of the dead"
1341,PROSERPINE,Thrust from forgotten graves upon their foes.
1342,PROSERPINE,Ah--horrid soil! for everything that grows
1343,PROSERPINE,In this confine but mocks in wicked scorn
1344,PROSERPINE,The fairness of the land where I was born.
