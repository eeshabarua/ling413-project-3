12,,[Inscription: I will add a few words respecting my kings and
13,,Queens.
14,,
15,,"They were hastily written from the impulse of the moment, for my"
16,,"own entertainment, and that of my youngest grand-daughter, without"
17,,the remotest idea of printing them. This is my apology for the
18,,"careless, familiar style in which they were composed. At the"
19,,"request of my children I concluded to print them, when it would"
20,,have been highly proper to have furnished my royal personages with
21,,a dress more befitting the occasion. But the state of my eyes
22,,"rendered it very inconvenient, if not hazardous to attempt it."
23,,"And as they are only intended to visit a few of my friends, I"
24,,trust to their good nature to excuse the homely garb in which they
25,,are presented.]

66,PREFACE.,
67,PREFACE.,I must claim the indulgence of my friends for the many defects they will
68,PREFACE.,"find in my poems, which they will please wink at, remembering that I was"
69,PREFACE.,"sixty years old when I commenced rhyming; and this by way of experiment,"
70,PREFACE.,"while on a visit to my daughter, in Brooklyn."
71,PREFACE.,
72,PREFACE.,"My first essay, was The Monarchs of England. I took it up for my"
73,PREFACE.,"amusement, wishing to ascertain how much of that history I could recollect"
74,PREFACE.,without help from any other source than memory.
75,PREFACE.,
76,PREFACE.,"The rhyme is in many places far from smooth, and there are many"
77,PREFACE.,redundances that might with advantage be lopped off; and were it to come
78,PREFACE.,"under the critic's eye to be reviewed, I should feel it quite necessary to"
79,PREFACE.,"improve it, (the poetry, I mean.) But as it would require quite too much"
80,PREFACE.,"exertion for my eyes in their present state, and as the history, dates,"
81,PREFACE.,"&c., I believe, are correct, I send it to the press ""with all its"
82,PREFACE.,"imperfections on its head."""

153,INCLUSIVE.,"First, William the Norman lays claim to the crown"
154,INCLUSIVE.,And retains it till death; then follows his son
155,INCLUSIVE.,"The red headed William, whose life is cut short"
156,INCLUSIVE.,"By a shot from his friend, when hunting for sport."
157,INCLUSIVE.,"Then Henry his brother takes quiet possession,"
158,INCLUSIVE.,"As Henry the first, of the great English nation."
159,INCLUSIVE.,"Next Stephen, a kinsman gets the crown by his might,"
160,INCLUSIVE.,But no one pretends to say he had a right.
161,INCLUSIVE.,"Then comes Hal the second, who cuts a great figure"
162,INCLUSIVE.,"With Becket, fair Rosamond and Queen Eliner."
163,INCLUSIVE.,"The Lion-hearted _Richard_, first of that name,"
164,INCLUSIVE.,Succeeded his father in power and in fame;
165,INCLUSIVE.,He joined the Crusade to a far distant land
166,INCLUSIVE.,But his life was cut short by a murderous hand.
167,INCLUSIVE.,"Next comes the _cruel_ and _cowardly_ John,"
168,INCLUSIVE.,"From whose hand, reluctant, Magna Charta was won."
169,INCLUSIVE.,"Then his son Henry third, deny it who can?"
170,INCLUSIVE.,"Though unfit for a King, was yet a good man,"
171,INCLUSIVE.,And his reign though a long one of fifty-six years
172,INCLUSIVE.,"Was full of perplexities, sorrows, and fears."
173,INCLUSIVE.,"His son Edward first next governs the nation,"
174,INCLUSIVE.,"Much respected and feared, in holding that station."
175,INCLUSIVE.,"The Principality of Wales was annexed in his reign,"
176,INCLUSIVE.,"And his son Edward second, first Prince of that name."
177,INCLUSIVE.,"But what shall I say of King Edward the third,"
178,INCLUSIVE.,"The most remarkable reign, that yet had occurred;"
179,INCLUSIVE.,"Fire arms in the war, were _first_ used in his reign,"
180,INCLUSIVE.,"And the battle of _Cressy_ of great note and fame,"
181,INCLUSIVE.,To their introduction has the right to lay claim.
182,INCLUSIVE.,"The knights of the Garter, first made in his reign"
183,INCLUSIVE.,"In honor it seems of a fair English dame,"
184,INCLUSIVE.,"The Duchess of Salisbury to whom it is said,"
185,INCLUSIVE.,From Edward _peculiar_ attentions were paid.
186,INCLUSIVE.,"Of Richard the second we have little to say,"
187,INCLUSIVE.,"And take up the fourth Henry, the next on our way,"
188,INCLUSIVE.,"Who reigned fourteen years, when death cut him down"
189,INCLUSIVE.,And left his good Kingdom to Henry his son;
190,INCLUSIVE.,"But ere nine years had past, the fifth Henry was borne"
191,INCLUSIVE.,To the region of darkness from whence none return.
192,INCLUSIVE.,"The next reign is full of commotion and strife,"
193,INCLUSIVE.,And Henry the sixth is seen flying for life;
194,INCLUSIVE.,"For though King of England, we cannot but see"
195,INCLUSIVE.,He's but the shadow of a king--that _should_ be;
196,INCLUSIVE.,And during the thirty-nine years that he reigned
197,INCLUSIVE.,His crown and his sceptre were feebly retained.
198,INCLUSIVE.,"It was in this reign on her mission intent,"
199,INCLUSIVE.,That Joan of Arc to the battle field went:
200,INCLUSIVE.,"The French troops were elated, the English dismayed"
201,INCLUSIVE.,At the wonderful victories achieved by her aid;
202,INCLUSIVE.,"At length fortune turns, and 'tis needless to tell"
203,INCLUSIVE.,Of the fate of this maiden--it is all known too well.
204,INCLUSIVE.,Of Edward the fourth it seems proper to say
205,INCLUSIVE.,"That he fancied Dame Shore, when wed to Bess Gray."
206,INCLUSIVE.,"But the fate of Jane Shore, should be warning to all"
207,INCLUSIVE.,"Who from love, or ambition, are tempted to fall."
208,INCLUSIVE.,"When Edward the fourth departed this earth,"
209,INCLUSIVE.,"He left two little sons, both Royal by birth;"
210,INCLUSIVE.,"But ere three years had pass'd, both met with their doom,"
211,INCLUSIVE.,"By a most cruel uncle, cut down in their bloom"
212,INCLUSIVE.,"Of youth, love, and beauty, and laid in the tomb."
213,INCLUSIVE.,"King Edward the fifth was the eldest one's name,"
214,INCLUSIVE.,Though never permitted by his uncle to reign.
215,INCLUSIVE.,"Next comes cruel Richard, the third of that name,"
216,INCLUSIVE.,Whose vices surpassing put others to shame.
217,INCLUSIVE.,"When unhorsed in battle, he's so anxious to live,"
218,INCLUSIVE.,"That he cries ""for a horse, my kingdom I'll give."""
219,INCLUSIVE.,But in the same battle he had his last fall--
220,INCLUSIVE.,"Lamented by none, but detested by all."
221,INCLUSIVE.,"In the next reign the wars of the roses, all ended,"
222,INCLUSIVE.,"And the red rose and white, forever were blended;"
223,INCLUSIVE.,"For when Henry the seventh took Bessy his bride,"
224,INCLUSIVE.,The knot of the roses forever was tied;
225,INCLUSIVE.,"And when the sceptre descended from father to son,"
226,INCLUSIVE.,The red and the white leaves all mingled in one.
227,INCLUSIVE.,King Henry the eighth had quite a long reign
228,INCLUSIVE.,"Mixed up with his Anne's, his Katy's and Jane."
229,INCLUSIVE.,"But from this King we turn with disgust and with shame,"
230,INCLUSIVE.,"And greet with delight, the sixth Edward by name."
231,INCLUSIVE.,"But only six years did this King fill the throne,"
232,INCLUSIVE.,When called to resign it and lay his crown down.
233,INCLUSIVE.,"A worthier we think, has never set"
234,INCLUSIVE.,On the throne of Great Britain--at least not as yet.
235,INCLUSIVE.,"With pleasure we love to contemplate him now,"
236,INCLUSIVE.,"With a bright crown of Glory, encircling his brow,"
237,INCLUSIVE.,"In the region of _light, love, peace_, and of joy,"
238,INCLUSIVE.,Where pleasures eternal can have no alloy.
239,INCLUSIVE.,"Sin, sickness, and death, never find entrance there,"
240,INCLUSIVE.,"For the air is all balm, and the skies ever fair;"
241,INCLUSIVE.,The clouds of his young life have all passed away
242,INCLUSIVE.,And he enjoys the full light of an endless day--
243,INCLUSIVE.,"For all who find footing on that peaceful shore,"
244,INCLUSIVE.,"Shall hunger, and thirst, and sorrow no more."
245,INCLUSIVE.,"But once more we return to this ""dim speck of earth,"""
246,INCLUSIVE.,And revisit the clime that gave Edward his birth.
247,INCLUSIVE.,"Bloody Mary his sister, next mounted the throne,"
248,INCLUSIVE.,"But when five years had pass'd, was obliged to lay down,"
249,INCLUSIVE.,"Notwithstanding reluctance, her Sceptre and Crown."
250,INCLUSIVE.,"For death to whom she had sent many a one,"
251,INCLUSIVE.,"Now called for his victim, and made her his own."
252,INCLUSIVE.,"Not by _fire_ and by _faggot_ was _she_ hurried away,"
253,INCLUSIVE.,But by painful sickness and loathsome decay.
254,INCLUSIVE.,"Now commences the reign of the ""Good Queen Bess,"""
255,INCLUSIVE.,But _why_ she's called _good_ I never could guess:
256,INCLUSIVE.,"Yet justice constrains me to allow in the main,"
257,INCLUSIVE.,That her's was a glorious and most prosperous reign.
258,INCLUSIVE.,She had the good sense to know whom to admit
259,INCLUSIVE.,"To her private councils, as men the most fit;"
260,INCLUSIVE.,"And by their advice, good sense and discretion,"
261,INCLUSIVE.,She managed with _fitness_ to govern the nation.
262,INCLUSIVE.,"As a Queen she seems great, though _weak_ as a woman,"
263,INCLUSIVE.,"And when praised as a _Goddess_, was no more than human;"
264,INCLUSIVE.,"At the age of threescore, she loved to be compared"
265,INCLUSIVE.,"As a beauty to Venus, though crook'd and red haired."
266,INCLUSIVE.,"Of lovers she had full many a one,"
267,INCLUSIVE.,"Who sought, through her hand, a pass to the throne,"
268,INCLUSIVE.,"But chose to remain single; for full well she knew,"
269,INCLUSIVE.,"That in giving her hand, she gave away her power too."
270,INCLUSIVE.,"In this reign we find ineffacible blots,"
271,INCLUSIVE.,"In the treatment of Essex, and Mary of Scots;"
272,INCLUSIVE.,"The death of the former, the Queen sorely repents,"
273,INCLUSIVE.,And for her lost Essex she deeply laments.
274,INCLUSIVE.,"The remorse of a Countess, in keeping his ring,"
275,INCLUSIVE.,"I leave to some rhymer, more able to sing."
276,INCLUSIVE.,"Next James sixth of Scotland, _first_ of England became--"
277,INCLUSIVE.,In peace and security permitted to reign.
278,INCLUSIVE.,"In the person of James, two crowns were united,"
279,INCLUSIVE.,And England and Scotland remain undivided.
280,INCLUSIVE.,"With this king the reign of the Stuarts began,"
281,INCLUSIVE.,And continued to the end of the reign of Queen Ann.
282,INCLUSIVE.,"In the reign of Charles first, commences a strife"
283,INCLUSIVE.,"Between King and Parliament, that ends but with life;"
284,INCLUSIVE.,"This poor King was beheaded, his son had to flee,"
285,INCLUSIVE.,And in his place Oliver Cromwell we see.
286,INCLUSIVE.,Now in Cromwell the ruler of England we find;
287,INCLUSIVE.,"Right or wrong, I never could make up my mind;"
288,INCLUSIVE.,Still all must allow (for deny it who can?)
289,INCLUSIVE.,That this same Oliver was a very great man.
290,INCLUSIVE.,In eleven years the days of the Commonwealth ended.
291,INCLUSIVE.,"And gay Charles the second, the throne then ascended."
292,INCLUSIVE.,"This second king Charles king of hearts might be call'd,"
293,INCLUSIVE.,For many a fair one he seems t' have enthrall'd.
294,INCLUSIVE.,"James second, brother of Charles second succeeded,"
295,INCLUSIVE.,"But after a reign of four years, he seceded;"
296,INCLUSIVE.,"When quitting his throne, and his country he flies"
297,INCLUSIVE.,"Over the channel to France, where he dies."
298,INCLUSIVE.,"Next the Prince of Orange, (from Holland he came,)"
299,INCLUSIVE.,"For the crown of old England, asserted his claim"
300,INCLUSIVE.,"Through right of his wife, Princess Mary by name."
301,INCLUSIVE.,And William the third with Mary his wife
302,INCLUSIVE.,Are crowned King and Queen of England for life.
303,INCLUSIVE.,"This princess was lovely in person and mind,"
304,INCLUSIVE.,"As a wife most devoted, a _friend ever_ kind."
305,INCLUSIVE.,Queen Ann's is the next reign that in order appears
306,INCLUSIVE.,And it covers the space of thirteen full years.
307,INCLUSIVE.,"Her death brought the reign of the Stuarts to a close,"
308,INCLUSIVE.,"But firm on their ruins, the House of Hanover rose."
309,INCLUSIVE.,With this house the reign of the Georges begins--
310,INCLUSIVE.,And four in succession we count up as Kings.
311,INCLUSIVE.,"George the third, grandson of the second, so called,"
312,INCLUSIVE.,Was for virtues and goodness of heart much extolled.
313,INCLUSIVE.,"His reign the longest of any appears,"
314,INCLUSIVE.,Bearing title of king for sixty-two years.
315,INCLUSIVE.,"But when aged four score, this good king we find"
316,INCLUSIVE.,"Bereft of his senses and hearing, and blind."
317,INCLUSIVE.,"In this reign America declared herself free,"
318,INCLUSIVE.,And independent of rulers over the sea.
319,INCLUSIVE.,"At length death relieved him, and he was cut down,"
320,INCLUSIVE.,To make way for his eldest and libertine son.
321,INCLUSIVE.,"But though of talent acknowledged the son possessed more,"
322,INCLUSIVE.,"The _sire's heart was good_, the _son's corrupt at the core_;"
323,INCLUSIVE.,"Though admired for his beauty, and manners, and wit,"
324,INCLUSIVE.,As a husband and father he never was fit.
325,INCLUSIVE.,"But before we pass on to the next reign in course,"
326,INCLUSIVE.,"We have a most sorrowful tale to rehearse,"
327,INCLUSIVE.,"Of the young princess Charlotte, next heir to the crown,"
328,INCLUSIVE.,"In the spring time of life, scarce with warning cut down."
329,INCLUSIVE.,"If ever the nation were mourners sincere,"
330,INCLUSIVE.,'Twas when they united around the sad bier
331,INCLUSIVE.,Of this youthful princess so deservedly dear;
332,INCLUSIVE.,"And stout-hearted men unaccustomed to mourn,"
333,INCLUSIVE.,"Let bitter tears fall, as they gazed on her urn."
334,INCLUSIVE.,"But who can describe the anguish of one,"
335,INCLUSIVE.,The heart-stricken husband apart and alone.
336,INCLUSIVE.,"As the sun of his happiness rose to its height,"
337,INCLUSIVE.,"Death enters his dwelling, and lo! it is night;"
338,INCLUSIVE.,"The light of his house forever has fled,"
339,INCLUSIVE.,"For his loved one, his dearest, lies low with the dead."
340,INCLUSIVE.,"In the _same_ day all his fair prospects were crossed,"
341,INCLUSIVE.,"When a _wife_, and a _son_, and a _kingdom_ he lost."
342,INCLUSIVE.,"Next William the fourth, is proclaimed Britain's king,"
343,INCLUSIVE.,For between him and his brother two deaths intervene.
344,INCLUSIVE.,No _legitimate_ child did he leave in possession
345,INCLUSIVE.,"Of the Crown of old England, in right of succession;"
346,INCLUSIVE.,So the diadem passed to the youthful brow
347,INCLUSIVE.,"Of his niece Queen Victoria, who honors it now;"
348,INCLUSIVE.,"And for her we wish, as our rhyming we close,"
349,INCLUSIVE.,"A _long, peaceful reign_--an old age of repose."

1496,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"When attempting to write,"
1497,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,To one in your far famous city.
1498,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Indeed I'm inclined,"
1499,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,To fear that you'll find
1500,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"These lines heavy, and quite out of joint;"
1501,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"And now I declare,"
1502,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"It's no more than fair,"
1503,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Should this prove a dull letter,"
1504,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,That you write me a better;
1505,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And something that's quite to the point.
1506,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,This having premised
1507,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"As at present advised,"
1508,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"I'll indulge in the thoughts that incline,"

1512,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"If I recollect right,"

1514,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And not far from night
1515,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,When _the Boarding School famous_ I entered.
1516,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Now what could I do?
1517,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Scarce above my own shoe
1518,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Did I dare take a view,"
1519,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Or to speak, or e'en move hardly ventured."
1520,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,At this school I remained
1521,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Till supposed to have gained
1522,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Education quite good and sufficient;
1523,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"But one in those days,"
1524,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Thought deserving of praise,"
1525,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Would in these, be deemed very deficient."
1526,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And here we will try
1527,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Before the mind's eye,"
1528,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,To bring forward a few of that household;
1529,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"There were the witty,"
1530,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Also the pretty,"
1531,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"But some very plain,"
1532,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Not a few very vain,"
1533,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And among them the phlegmatic and cold.
1534,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Though it seems out of place
1535,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,I will here find a space
1536,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,For some few in the lower apartment;
1537,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Sure this must be right,"
1538,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,They contributed quite
1539,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"To our comfort, in their humble department."
1540,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Here's Lydia and Polly,"
1541,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"And Peter the jolly,"
1542,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,With teeth white as ivory
1543,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"And cheeks black as ebony,"
1544,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,So from Africa doubtless was he;
1545,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"But we'll ascend from below,"
1546,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And see entering just now
1547,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,With a Parisian bow
1548,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And all in a glow
1549,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Gay Monsieur Pichon,"
1550,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And French teacher Faucon;
1551,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Also V----, the Musician,"
1552,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"And B----, Mathematician."
1553,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Monsieur Laboltierre,"
1554,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,So brisk and debonnair
1555,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Had also been there;
1556,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"And there's Eggleston fair,"
1557,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,With whom none might compare.
1558,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Miss W----, romantic,"

1560,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And of others a score you might see.
1561,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,But here I propose
1562,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"The long list to close,"
1563,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,With addition of only one name;
1564,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Amidst the gay throng
1565,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Was one lovely and young,"
1566,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Who brought sunshine wherever she came.
1567,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"She had light brown hair,"
1568,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Was graceful and fair,"
1569,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Of children many
1570,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Youngest of any,"
1571,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And Margaret this maiden they call;
1572,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,A sweet smile she had
1573,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"That round her lips played,"
1574,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And with eyes bright and blue
1575,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,She'd a heart warm and true
1576,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And disposition affectionate withal.
1577,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,One advantage she'll allow
1578,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"That I have over her now,"
1579,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"The same in our youthful days, when"
1580,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,On our studies intent
1581,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Over school desk we bent,"
1582,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Her Senior I always have been.
1583,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,How like to a dream
1584,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Do those days to me seem,"
1585,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,When with others preparing to enter
1586,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"On the world's great stage,"
1587,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And with light heart engage
1588,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Our part in the drama to venture.
1589,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Of that school there's not one
1590,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Except thee alone,"
1591,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,Whom now living as friend I can claim;
1592,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Some have departed,"
1593,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"Some are false hearted,"
1594,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,And their friendship exists but in name.
1595,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,But that friendship's long lived
1596,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"That forty years has survived,"
1597,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"And may we not hope 'twill endure,"
1598,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,When in flames of fire
1599,TO MY FRIEND MRS. LLOYD,"This earth will expire,"
