40,,
41,,
42,,"""The Little Book of Modern Verse"", as its name implies,"
43,,is not a formal anthology.  The pageant of American poetry
44,,has been so often presented that no necessity exists
45,,"for another exhaustive review of the art.  Nearly all anthologies, however,"
46,,"stop short of the present group of poets, or represent them so inadequately"
47,,that only those in close touch with the trend of American literature
48,,know what the poet of to-day is contributing to it.
49,,
50,,"It is strictly, then, as a reflection of our own period,"
51,,"to show what is being done by the successors of our earlier poets,"
52,,"what new interpretation they are giving to life, what new beauty"
53,,"they have apprehended, what new art they have evolved,"
54,,that this little book has taken form.  A few of the poets included
55,,"have been writing for a quarter of a century, and were, therefore,"
56,,"among the immediate successors of the New England group,"
57,,but many have done their work within the past decade and the volume as a whole
58,,represents the twentieth-century spirit.
59,,
60,,"From the scheme of the book, that of a small, intimate collection,"
61,,"representative rather than exhaustive, it has been impossible"
62,,to include all of the poets who would naturally be included
63,,"in a more ambitious anthology.  In certain instances, also,"
64,,matters of copyright have deterred me from including those
65,,"whom I had originally intended to represent, but with isolated exceptions"
66,,the little book covers the work of our later poets and gives a hint
67,,of what they are doing.
68,,
69,,"I have attempted, as far as possible, to unify the collection by arranging"
70,,"the poems so that each should set the keynote to the next, or at least"
71,,"bear some relation to it in mood or theme.  While it is impossible,"
72,,"with so varied a mass of material, that such a sequence should be exact,"
73,,and in one or two instances the arrangement has been disturbed
74,,"by the late addition or elimination of poems, the idea has been"
75,,to differentiate the little volume from the typical anthology
76,,by giving it a unity impossible to a larger collection.

286,,Lord of my Heart's Elation.  [Bliss Carman]
287,,
288,,
289,,
290,,"Lord of my heart's elation,"
291,,"Spirit of things unseen,"
292,,Be thou my aspiration
293,,Consuming and serene!
294,,
295,,"Bear up, bear out, bear onward,"
296,,"This mortal soul alone,"
297,,"To selfhood or oblivion,"
298,,"Incredibly thine own, --"
299,,
300,,As the foamheads are loosened
301,,"And blown along the sea,"
302,,Or sink and merge forever
303,,In that which bids them be.
304,,
305,,"I, too, must climb in wonder,"
306,,"Uplift at thy command, --"
307,,Be one with my frail fellows
308,,"Beneath the wind's strong hand,"
309,,
310,,A fleet and shadowy column
311,,"Of dust or mountain rain,"
312,,To walk the earth a moment
313,,And be dissolved again.
314,,
315,,Be thou my exaltation
316,,"Or fortitude of mien,"
317,,"Lord of the world's elation,"
318,,Thou breath of things unseen!

323,,Gloucester Moors.  [William Vaughn Moody]
324,,
325,,
326,,
327,,A mile behind is Gloucester town
328,,"Where the fishing fleets put in,"
329,,A mile ahead the land dips down
330,,And the woods and farms begin.
331,,"Here, where the moors stretch free"
332,,"In the high blue afternoon,"
333,,"Are the marching sun and talking sea,"
334,,And the racing winds that wheel and flee
335,,On the flying heels of June.
336,,
337,,"Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,"
338,,"Blue is the quaker-maid,"
339,,The wild geranium holds its dew
340,,Long in the boulder's shade.
341,,Wax-red hangs the cup
342,,"From the huckleberry boughs,"
343,,In barberry bells the grey moths sup
344,,Or where the choke-cherry lifts high up
345,,Sweet bowls for their carouse.
346,,
347,,Over the shelf of the sandy cove
348,,Beach-peas blossom late.
349,,By copse and cliff the swallows rove
350,,Each calling to his mate.
351,,"Seaward the sea-gulls go,"
352,,And the land-birds all are here;
353,,"That green-gold flash was a vireo,"
354,,And yonder flame where the marsh-flags grow
355,,Was a scarlet tanager.
356,,
357,,This earth is not the steadfast place
358,,We landsmen build upon;
359,,"From deep to deep she varies pace,"
360,,And while she comes is gone.
361,,Beneath my feet I feel
362,,Her smooth bulk heave and dip;
363,,With velvet plunge and soft upreel
364,,She swings and steadies to her keel
365,,"Like a gallant, gallant ship."
366,,
367,,"These summer clouds she sets for sail,"
368,,"The sun is her masthead light,"
369,,She tows the moon like a pinnace frail
370,,Where her phosphor wake churns bright.
371,,"Now hid, now looming clear,"
372,,On the face of the dangerous blue
373,,"The star fleets tack and wheel and veer,"
374,,"But on, but on does the old earth steer"
375,,As if her port she knew.
376,,
377,,"God, dear God!  Does she know her port,"
378,,Though she goes so far about?
379,,"Or blind astray, does she make her sport"
380,,To brazen and chance it out?
381,,I watched when her captains passed:
382,,She were better captainless.
383,,"Men in the cabin, before the mast,"
384,,"But some were reckless and some aghast,"
385,,And some sat gorged at mess.
386,,
387,,By her battened hatch I leaned and caught
388,,"Sounds from the noisome hold, --"
389,,Cursing and sighing of souls distraught
390,,And cries too sad to be told.
391,,Then I strove to go down and see;
392,,"But they said, ""Thou art not of us!"""
393,,I turned to those on the deck with me
394,,"And cried, ""Give help!""  But they said, ""Let be:"
395,,"Our ship sails faster thus."""
396,,
397,,"Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue,"
398,,"Blue is the quaker-maid,"
399,,The alder-clump where the brook comes through
400,,Breeds cresses in its shade.
401,,To be out of the moiling street
402,,With its swelter and its sin!
403,,"Who has given to me this sweet,"
404,,And given my brother dust to eat?
405,,And when will his wage come in?
406,,
407,,"Scattering wide or blown in ranks,"
408,,"Yellow and white and brown,"
409,,Boats and boats from the fishing banks
410,,Come home to Gloucester town.
411,,"There is cash to purse and spend,"
412,,"There are wives to be embraced,"
413,,"Hearts to borrow and hearts to lend,"
414,,"And hearts to take and keep to the end, --"
415,,"O little sails, make haste!"
416,,
417,,"But thou, vast outbound ship of souls,"
418,,What harbor town for thee?
419,,"What shapes, when thy arriving tolls,"
420,,Shall crowd the banks to see?
421,,Shall all the happy shipmates then
422,,Stand singing brotherly?
423,,Or shall a haggard ruthless few
424,,"Warp her over and bring her to,"
425,,While the many broken souls of men
426,,"Fester down in the slaver's pen,"
427,,And nothing to say or do?
428,,

432,,On a Subway Express.  [Chester Firkins]
433,,
434,,
435,,
436,,"I, who have lost the stars, the sod,"
437,,"For chilling pave and cheerless light,"
438,,Have made my meeting-place with God
439,,A new and nether Night --
440,,
441,,Have found a fane where thunder fills
442,,"Loud caverns, tremulous; -- and these"
443,,Atone me for my reverend hills
444,,And moonlit silences.
445,,
446,,"A figment in the crowded dark,"
447,,"Where men sit muted by the roar,"
448,,I ride upon the whirring Spark
449,,Beneath the city's floor.
450,,
451,,"In this dim firmament, the stars"
452,,Whirl by in blazing files and tiers;
453,,"Kin meteors graze our flying bars,"
454,,Amid the spinning spheres.
455,,
456,,Speed! speed! until the quivering rails
457,,"Flash silver where the head-light gleams,"
458,,As when on lakes the Moon impales
459,,The waves upon its beams.
460,,
461,,"Life throbs about me, yet I stand"
462,,Outgazing on majestic Power;
463,,"Death rides with me, on either hand,"
464,,In my communion hour.
465,,
466,,"You that 'neath country skies can pray,"
467,,Scoff not at me -- the city clod; --
468,,My only respite of the Day
469,,Is this wild ride -- with God.
470,,

472,,
473,,
474,,The Automobile.  [Percy MacKaye]
475,,
476,,
477,,
478,,Fluid the world flowed under us:  the hills
479,,Billow on billow of umbrageous green
480,,"Heaved us, aghast, to fresh horizons, seen"
481,,"One rapturous instant, blind with flash of rills"
482,,And silver-rising storms and dewy stills
483,,"Of dripping boulders, till the dim ravine"
484,,"Drowned us again in leafage, whose serene"
485,,Coverts grew loud with our tumultuous wills.
486,,
487,,Then all of Nature's old amazement seemed
488,,"Sudden to ask us:  ""Is this also Man?"
489,,"This plunging, volant, land-amphibian"
490,,What Plato mused and Paracelsus dreamed?
491,,"Reply!""  And piercing us with ancient scan,"
492,,"The shrill, primeval hawk gazed down -- and screamed."
493,,

495,,
496,,
497,,The Black Vulture.  [George Sterling]
498,,
499,,
500,,
501,,"Aloof upon the day's immeasured dome,"
502,,He holds unshared the silence of the sky.
503,,"Far down his bleak, relentless eyes descry"
504,,The eagle's empire and the falcon's home --
505,,"Far down, the galleons of sunset roam;"
506,,His hazards on the sea of morning lie;
507,,"Serene, he hears the broken tempest sigh"
508,,Where cold sierras gleam like scattered foam.
509,,
510,,And least of all he holds the human swarm --
511,,Unwitting now that envious men prepare
512,,"To make their dream and its fulfillment one,"
513,,"When, poised above the caldrons of the storm,"
514,,"Their hearts, contemptuous of death, shall dare"
515,,His roads between the thunder and the sun.

520,,Chavez.  [Mildred McNeal Sweeney]
521,,
522,,
523,,
524,,"So hath he fallen, the Endymion of the air,"
525,,And so lies down in slumber lapped for aye.
526,,"Diana, passing, found his youth too fair,"
527,,His soul too fleet and willing to obey.
528,,She swung her golden moon before his eyes --
529,,"Dreaming, he rose to follow -- and ran -- and was away."
530,,
531,,His foot was winged as the mounting sun.
532,,Earth he disdained -- the dusty ways of men
533,,Not yet had learned.  His spirit longed to run
534,,"With the bright clouds, his brothers, to answer when"
535,,The airs were fleetest and could give him hand
536,,Into the starry fields beyond our plodding ken.
537,,
538,,"All wittingly that glorious way he chose,"
539,,And loved the peril when it was most bright.
540,,He tried anew the long-forbidden snows
541,,And like an eagle topped the dropping height
542,,"Of Nagenhorn, and still toward Italy"
543,,"Past peak and cliff pressed on, in glad, unerring flight."
544,,
545,,"Oh, when the bird lies low with golden wing"
546,,"Bruised past healing by some bitter chance,"
547,,Still must its tireless spirit mount and sing
548,,"Of meadows green with morning, of the dance"
549,,"On windy trees, the darting flight away,"
550,,"And of that last, most blue, triumphant downward glance."
551,,
552,,"So murmuring of the snow:  ""THE SNOW, AND MORE,"
553,,"O GOD, MORE SNOW!"" on that last field he lay."
554,,Despair and wonder spent their passionate store
555,,"In his great heart, through heaven gone astray,"
556,,And early lost.  Too far the golden moon
557,,"Had swung upon that bright, that long, untraversed way."
558,,
559,,Now to lie ended on the murmuring plain --
560,,"Ah, this for his bold heart was not the loss,"
561,,But that those windy fields he ne'er again
562,,"Might try, nor fleet and shimmering mountains cross,"
563,,"Unfollowed, by a path none other knew:"
564,,His bitter woe had here its deep and piteous cause.
565,,
566,,"Dear toils of youth unfinished!  And songs unwritten, left"
567,,By young and passionate hearts!  O melodies
568,,"Unheard, whereof we ever stand bereft!"
569,,"Clear-singing Schubert, boyish Keats -- with these"
570,,"He roams henceforth, one with the starry band,"
571,,Still paying to fairy call and far command
572,,"His spirit heed, still winged with golden prophecies."

581,,"I am fevered with the sunset,"
582,,"I am fretful with the bay,"
583,,For the wander-thirst is on me
584,,And my soul is in Cathay.
585,,
586,,"There's a schooner in the offing,"
587,,"With her topsails shot with fire,"

605,I,"England, I stand on thy imperial ground,"
606,I,"Not all a stranger; as thy bugles blow,"
607,I,I feel within my blood old battles flow --
608,I,The blood whose ancient founts in thee are found
609,I,Still surging dark against the Christian bound
610,I,Wide Islam presses; well its peoples know
611,I,Thy heights that watch them wandering below;
612,I,I think how Lucknow heard their gathering sound.
613,I,"I turn, and meet the cruel, turbaned face."
614,I,"England, 't is sweet to be so much thy son!"
615,I,I feel the conqueror in my blood and race;
616,I,"Last night Trafalgar awed me, and to-day"

642,II,
643,II,"(From ""The City"")"
644,II,
645,II,
646,II,
647,II,"Of old it went forth to Euchenor, pronounced of his sire --"
648,II,"Reluctant, impelled by the god's unescapable fire --"
649,II,To choose for his doom or to perish at home of disease
650,II,"Or be slain of his foes, among men, where Troy surges down to the seas."
651,II,
652,II,"Polyides, the soothsayer, spake it, inflamed by the god."
653,II,Of his son whom the fates singled out did he bruit it abroad;
654,II,And Euchenor went down to the ships with his armor and men
655,II,"And straightway, grown dim on the gulf, passed the isles"
656,II,he passed never again.
657,II,
658,II,"Why weep ye, O women of Corinth?  The doom ye have heard"
659,II,Is it strange to your ears that ye make it so mournful a word?
660,II,"Is he who so fair in your eyes to his manhood upgrew,"
661,II,Alone in his doom of pale death -- are of mortals the beaten so few?
662,II,
663,II,"O weep not, companions and lovers!  Turn back to your joys:"
664,II,"The defeat was not his which he chose, nor the victory Troy's."
665,II,"Him a conqueror, beauteous in youth, o'er the flood his fleet brought,"
666,II,And the swift spear of Paris that slew completed the conquest he sought.
667,II,
668,II,"Not the falling proclaims the defeat, but the place of the fall;"
669,II,And the fate that decrees and the god that impels through it all
670,II,"Regard not blind mortals' divisions of slayer and slain,"
671,II,But invisible glories dispense wide over the war-gleaming plain.

677,II,
678,II,
679,II,
680,II,"He whom a dream hath possessed knoweth no more of doubting,"
681,II,For mist and the blowing of winds and the mouthing of words he scorns;
682,II,"Not the sinuous speech of schools he hears, but a knightly shouting,"
683,II,"And never comes darkness down, yet he greeteth a million morns."
684,II,
685,II,He whom a dream hath possessed knoweth no more of roaming;
686,II,"All roads and the flowing of waves and the speediest flight he knows,"
687,II,"But wherever his feet are set, his soul is forever homing,"
688,II,"And going, he comes, and coming he heareth a call and goes."
689,II,
690,II,"He whom a dream hath possessed knoweth no more of sorrow,"
691,II,"At death and the dropping of leaves and the fading of suns he smiles,"
692,II,"For a dream remembers no past and scorns the desire of a morrow,"
693,II,And a dream in a sea of doom sets surely the ultimate isles.
694,II,
695,II,"He whom a dream hath possessed treads the impalpable marches,"
696,II,"From the dust of the day's long road he leaps to a laughing star,"
697,II,"And the ruin of worlds that fall he views from eternal arches,"
698,II,And rides God's battlefield in a flashing and golden car.

703,II,The Kings.  [Louise Imogen Guiney]
704,II,
705,II,
706,II,
707,II,A man said unto his Angel:
708,II,"""My spirits are fallen low,"
709,II,And I cannot carry this battle:
710,II,O brother! where might I go?
711,II,
712,II,"""The terrible Kings are on me"
713,II,With spears that are deadly bright;
714,II,Against me so from the cradle
715,II,"Do fate and my fathers fight."""
716,II,
717,II,Then said to the man his Angel:
718,II,"""Thou wavering, witless soul,"
719,II,Back to the ranks!  What matter
720,II,"To win or to lose the whole,"
721,II,
722,II,"""As judged by the little judges"
723,II,"Who hearken not well, nor see?"
724,II,"Not thus, by the outer issue,"
725,II,The Wise shall interpret thee.
726,II,
727,II,"""Thy will is the sovereign measure"
728,II,And only events of things:
729,II,"The puniest heart, defying,"
730,II,Were stronger than all these Kings.
731,II,
732,II,"""Though out of the past they gather,"
733,II,"Mind's Doubt, and Bodily Pain,"
734,II,And pallid Thirst of the Spirit
735,II,"That is kin to the other twain,"
736,II,
737,II,"""And Grief, in a cloud of banners,"
738,II,"And ringletted Vain Desires,"
739,II,"And Vice, with the spoils upon him"
740,II,"Of thee and thy beaten sires, --"
741,II,
742,II,"""While Kings of eternal evil"
743,II,"Yet darken the hills about,"
744,II,Thy part is with broken sabre
745,II,To rise on the last redoubt;
746,II,
747,II,"""To fear not sensible failure,"
748,II,"Nor covet the game at all,"
749,II,"But fighting, fighting, fighting,"
750,II,"Die, driven against the wall."""

760,II,"When along country roads You walk with me,"
761,II,And my faith blossoms like the earliest tree
762,II,That shames the bleak world with its yellow sprays --
763,II,"My faith revives, when through a rosy haze"
764,II,"The clover-sprinkled hills smile quietly,"
765,II,Young winds uplift a bird's clean ecstasy . . .
766,II,"For this, O God, my joyousness and praise!"
767,II,
768,II,"But now -- the crowded streets and choking airs,"
769,II,"The squalid people, bruised and tossed about;"
770,II,"These, or the over-brilliant thoroughfares,"
771,II,"The too-loud laughter and the empty shout,"
772,II,"The mirth-mad city, tragic with its cares . . ."
773,II,"For this, O God, my silence -- and my doubt."

783,I,
784,I,Before the solemn bronze Saint Gaudens made
785,I,"To thrill the heedless passer's heart with awe,"
786,I,And set here in the city's talk and trade
787,I,"To the good memory of Robert Shaw,"
788,I,"This bright March morn I stand,"
789,I,And hear the distant spring come up the land;
790,I,Knowing that what I hear is not unheard
791,I,"Of this boy soldier and his Negro band,"
792,I,"For all their gaze is fixed so stern ahead,"
793,I,For all the fatal rhythm of their tread.
794,I,The land they died to save from death and shame
795,I,"Trembles and waits, hearing the spring's great name,"
796,I,And by her pangs these resolute ghosts are stirred.
797,I,
798,I,
799,II,II
800,II,
801,II,Through street and mall the tides of people go
802,II,Heedless; the trees upon the Common show
803,II,No hint of green; but to my listening heart
804,II,The still earth doth impart
805,II,"Assurance of her jubilant emprise,"
806,II,And it is clear to my long-searching eyes
807,II,That love at last has might upon the skies.
808,II,The ice is runneled on the little pond;
809,II,A telltale patter drips from off the trees;
810,II,"The air is touched with Southland spiceries,"
811,II,As if but yesterday it tossed the frond
812,II,Of pendant mosses where the live-oaks grow
813,II,"Beyond Virginia and the Carolines,"
814,II,Or had its will among the fruits and vines
815,II,Of aromatic isles asleep beyond
816,II,Florida and the Gulf of Mexico.

820,III,
821,III,"Soon shall the Cape Ann children shout in glee,"
822,III,"Spying the arbutus, spring's dear recluse;"
823,III,Hill lads at dawn shall hearken the wild goose
824,III,Go honking northward over Tennessee;
825,III,"West from Oswego to Sault Sainte-Marie,"
826,III,"And on to where the Pictured Rocks are hung,"
827,III,"And yonder where, gigantic, wilful, young,"
828,III,"Chicago sitteth at the northwest gates,"
829,III,With restless violent hands and casual tongue
830,III,"Moulding her mighty fates,"
831,III,The Lakes shall robe them in ethereal sheen;
832,III,"And like a larger sea, the vital green"
833,III,Of springing wheat shall vastly be outflung
834,III,Over Dakota and the prairie states.
835,III,By desert people immemorial
836,III,On Arizonan mesas shall be done
837,III,Dim rites unto the thunder and the sun;
838,III,Nor shall the primal gods lack sacrifice
839,III,"More splendid, when the white Sierras call"
840,III,Unto the Rockies straightway to arise
841,III,And dance before the unveiled ark of the year
842,III,"Sounding their windy cedars as for shawms,"
843,III,Unrolling rivers clear
844,III,For flutter of broad phylacteries;
845,III,While Shasta signals to Alaskan seas
846,III,That watch old sluggish glaciers downward creep
847,III,"To fling their icebergs thundering from the steep,"
848,III,And Mariposa through the purple calms
849,III,Gazes at far Hawaii crowned with palms
850,III,"Where East and West are met, --"
851,III,A rich seal on the ocean's bosom set
852,III,"To say that East and West are twain,"
853,III,With different loss and gain:
854,III,The Lord hath sundered them; let them be sundered yet.
855,III,
856,III,
857,IV,IV
858,IV,
859,IV,Alas! what sounds are these that come
860,IV,"Sullenly over the Pacific seas, --"
861,IV,"Sounds of ignoble battle, striking dumb"
862,IV,The season's half-awakened ecstasies?
863,IV,"Must I be humble, then,"
864,IV,Now when my heart hath need of pride?
865,IV,Wild love falls on me from these sculptured men;
866,IV,By loving much the land for which they died
867,IV,I would be justified.
868,IV,My spirit was away on pinions wide
869,IV,To soothe in praise of her its passionate mood
870,IV,And ease it of its ache of gratitude.
871,IV,Too sorely heavy is the debt they lay
872,IV,On me and the companions of my day.
873,IV,I would remember now
874,IV,"My country's goodliness, make sweet her name."
875,IV,Alas! what shade art thou
876,IV,Of sorrow or of blame
877,IV,"Liftest the lyric leafage from her brow,"
878,IV,And pointest a slow finger at her shame?
879,IV,
880,IV,

882,V,
883,V,Lies! lies!  It cannot be!  The wars we wage
884,V,"Are noble, and our battles still are won"
885,V,"By justice for us, ere we lift the gage."
886,V,We have not sold our loftiest heritage.
887,V,The proud republic hath not stooped to cheat
888,V,And scramble in the market-place of war;
889,V,Her forehead weareth yet its solemn star.
890,V,"Here is her witness:  this, her perfect son,"
891,V,This delicate and proud New England soul
892,V,"Who leads despised men, with just-unshackled feet,"
893,V,"Up the large ways where death and glory meet,"
894,V,"To show all peoples that our shame is done,"
895,V,That once more we are clean and spirit-whole.
896,V,
897,V,
898,VI,VI
899,VI,
900,VI,Crouched in the sea-fog on the moaning sand
901,VI,"All night he lay, speaking some simple word"
902,VI,"From hour to hour to the slow minds that heard,"
903,VI,Holding each poor life gently in his hand
904,VI,And breathing on the base rejected clay
905,VI,Till each dark face shone mystical and grand
906,VI,Against the breaking day;
907,VI,"And lo, the shard the potter cast away"
908,VI,"Was grown a fiery chalice crystal-fine,"
909,VI,Fulfilled of the divine
910,VI,Great wine of battle wrath by God's ring-finger stirred.
911,VI,"Then upward, where the shadowy bastion loomed"
912,VI,"Huge on the mountain in the wet sea light,"
913,VI,"Whence now, and now, infernal flowerage bloomed,"
914,VI,"Bloomed, burst, and scattered down its deadly seed, --"
915,VI,"They swept, and died like freemen on the height,"
916,VI,"Like freemen, and like men of noble breed;"
917,VI,And when the battle fell away at night
918,VI,By hasty and contemptuous hands were thrust
919,VI,Obscurely in a common grave with him
920,VI,The fair-haired keeper of their love and trust.
921,VI,Now limb doth mingle with dissolved limb
922,VI,In nature's busy old democracy
923,VI,To flush the mountain laurel when she blows
924,VI,"Sweet by the Southern sea,"
925,VI,And heart with crumbled heart climbs in the rose: --
926,VI,The untaught hearts with the high heart that knew
927,VI,This mountain fortress for no earthly hold
928,VI,"Of temporal quarrel, but the bastion old"
929,VI,"Of spiritual wrong,"
930,VI,"Built by an unjust nation sheer and strong,"
931,VI,Expugnable but by a nation's rue
932,VI,And bowing down before that equal shrine
933,VI,"By all men held divine,"
934,VI,Whereof his band and he were the most holy sign.
935,VI,
936,VI,
937,VII,VII
938,VII,
939,VII,"O bitter, bitter shade!"
940,VII,Wilt thou not put the scorn
941,VII,And instant tragic question from thine eye?
942,VII,Do thy dark brows yet crave
943,VII,That swift and angry stave --
944,VII,Unmeet for this desirous morn --
945,VII,"That I have striven, striven to evade?"
946,VII,"Gazing on him, must I not deem they err"
947,VII,Whose careless lips in street and shop aver
948,VII,"As common tidings, deeds to make his cheek"
949,VII,"Flush from the bronze, and his dead throat to speak?"
950,VII,"Surely some elder singer would arise,"
951,VII,Whose harp hath leave to threaten and to mourn
952,VII,Above this people when they go astray.
953,VII,"Is Whitman, the strong spirit, overworn?"
954,VII,Has Whittier put his yearning wrath away?
955,VII,I will not and I dare not yet believe!
956,VII,"Though furtively the sunlight seems to grieve,"
957,VII,And the spring-laden breeze
958,VII,Out of the gladdening west is sinister
959,VII,With sounds of nameless battle overseas;
960,VII,Though when we turn and question in suspense
961,VII,"If these things be indeed after these ways,"
962,VII,"And what things are to follow after these,"
963,VII,Our fluent men of place and consequence
964,VII,"Fumble and fill their mouths with hollow phrase,"
965,VII,Or for the end-all of deep arguments
966,VII,Intone their dull commercial liturgies --
967,VII,I dare not yet believe!  My ears are shut!
968,VII,I will not hear the thin satiric praise
969,VII,"And muffled laughter of our enemies,"
970,VII,Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword
971,VII,Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd
972,VII,Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian's hut;
973,VII,Showing how wise it is to cast away
974,VII,"The symbols of our spiritual sway,"
975,VII,That so our hands with better ease
976,VII,May wield the driver's whip and grasp the jailer's keys.
977,VII,
978,VII,
979,VIII,VIII
980,VIII,
981,VIII,Was it for this our fathers kept the law?
982,VIII,This crown shall crown their struggle and their ruth?
983,VIII,Are we the eagle nation Milton saw
984,VIII,"Mewing its mighty youth,"
985,VIII,"Soon to possess the mountain winds of truth,"
986,VIII,And be a swift familiar of the sun
987,VIII,Where aye before God's face his trumpets run?
988,VIII,"Or have we but the talons and the maw,"
989,VIII,And for the abject likeness of our heart
990,VIII,Shall some less lordly bird be set apart?
991,VIII,Some gross-billed wader where the swamps are fat?
992,VIII,Some gorger in the sun?  Some prowler with the bat?
993,VIII,
994,VIII,
995,IX,IX

1009,IX,"Shed on the awful hill slope at San Juan,"
1010,IX,By the unforgotten names of eager boys
1011,IX,Who might have tasted girl's love and been stung
1012,IX,With the old mystic joys
1013,IX,"And starry griefs, now the spring nights come on,"
1014,IX,"But that the heart of youth is generous, --"
1015,IX,"We charge you, ye who lead us,"
1016,IX,Breathe on their chivalry no hint of stain!
1017,IX,Turn not their new-world victories to gain!
1018,IX,One least leaf plucked for chaffer from the bays
1019,IX,"Of their dear praise,"
1020,IX,"One jot of their pure conquest put to hire,"
1021,IX,The implacable republic will require;
1022,IX,"With clamor, in the glare and gaze of noon,"
1023,IX,"Or subtly, coming as a thief at night,"
1024,IX,"But surely, very surely, slow or soon"
1025,IX,That insult deep we deeply will requite.
1026,IX,"Tempt not our weakness, our cupidity!"
1027,IX,"For save we let the island men go free,"
1028,IX,Those baffled and dislaureled ghosts
1029,IX,Will curse us from the lamentable coasts
1030,IX,Where walk the frustrate dead.
1031,IX,"The cup of trembling shall be drained quite,"
1032,IX,"Eaten the sour bread of astonishment,"
1033,IX,With ashes of the hearth shall be made white

1035,IX,Then on your guiltier head
1036,IX,Shall our intolerable self-disdain
1037,IX,Wreak suddenly its anger and its pain;
1038,IX,For manifest in that disastrous light
1039,IX,We shall discern the right

1059,IX,"O furry living things, adream"
1060,IX,"On winter's drowsy breast,"
1061,IX,"(How rest ye there, how softly, safely rest!)"
1062,IX,Arise and follow where a gleam
1063,IX,"Of wizard gold unbinds the stream,"
1064,IX,And all the woodland windings seem
1065,IX,With sweet expectance blest.
1066,IX,
1067,IX,"My birds, come back! the hollow sky"
1068,IX,Is weary for your note.
1069,IX,"(Sweet-throat, come back!  O liquid, mellow throat!)"
1070,IX,"Ere May's soft minions hereward fly,"
1071,IX,"Shame on ye, laggards, to deny"

1082,IX,The old eternal spring once more
1083,IX,"Comes back the sad eternal way,"
1084,IX,With tender rosy light before
1085,IX,The going-out of day.
1086,IX,
1087,IX,The great white moon across my door
1088,IX,A shadow in the twilight stirs;
1089,IX,But now forever comes no more
1090,IX,That wondrous look of Hers.

1097,IX,
1098,IX,
1099,IX,"O little buds all bourgeoning with Spring,"
1100,IX,You hold my winter in forgetfulness;
1101,IX,"Without my window lilac branches swing,"
1102,IX,Within my gate I hear a robin sing --
1103,IX,O little laughing blooms that lift and bless!
1104,IX,
1105,IX,"So blow the breezes in a soft caress,"
1106,IX,Blowing my dreams upon a swallow's wing;
1107,IX,"O little merry buds in dappled dress,"
1108,IX,You fill my heart with very wantonness --
1109,IX,O little buds all bourgeoning with Spring!

1114,IX,May is building her House.  [Richard Le Gallienne]
1115,IX,
1116,IX,
1117,IX,
1118,IX,May is building her house.  With apple blooms
1119,IX,She is roofing over the glimmering rooms;
1120,IX,"Of the oak and the beech hath she builded its beams,"
1121,IX,"And, spinning all day at her secret looms,"
1122,IX,With arras of leaves each wind-swayed wall
1123,IX,"She pictureth over, and peopleth it all"
1124,IX,"With echoes and dreams,"
1125,IX,And singing of streams.
1126,IX,
1127,IX,"May is building her house.  Of petal and blade,"
1128,IX,"Of the roots of the oak, is the flooring made,"
1129,IX,"With a carpet of mosses and lichen and clover,"
1130,IX,"Each small miracle over and over,"
1131,IX,"And tender, traveling green things strayed."
1132,IX,
1133,IX,"Her windows, the morning and evening star,"
1134,IX,"And her rustling doorways, ever ajar"
1135,IX,With the coming and going
1136,IX,"Of fair things blowing,"
1137,IX,The thresholds of the four winds are.
1138,IX,
1139,IX,May is building her house.  From the dust of things
1140,IX,She is making the songs and the flowers and the wings;
1141,IX,From October's tossed and trodden gold
1142,IX,She is making the young year out of the old;
1143,IX,Yea:  out of winter's flying sleet
1144,IX,"She is making all the summer sweet,"
1145,IX,And the brown leaves spurned of November's feet
1146,IX,She is changing back again to spring's.

1152,IX,
1153,IX,
1154,IX,
1155,IX,"Here is the place where Loveliness keeps house,"
1156,IX,"Between the river and the wooded hills,"
1157,IX,Within a valley where the Springtime spills
1158,IX,Her firstling wind-flowers under blossoming boughs:
1159,IX,"Where Summer sits braiding her warm, white brows"
1160,IX,With bramble-roses; and where Autumn fills
1161,IX,Her lap with asters; and old Winter frills
1162,IX,With crimson haw and hip his snowy blouse.
1163,IX,Here you may meet with Beauty.  Here she sits
1164,IX,"Gazing upon the moon, or all the day"
1165,IX,"Tuning a wood-thrush flute, remote, unseen:"
1166,IX,"Or when the storm is out, 't is she who flits"
1167,IX,"From rock to rock, a form of flying spray,"
1168,IX,"Shouting, beneath the leaves' tumultuous green."

1176,IX,
1177,IX,"O brown brook, O blithe brook, what will you say to me"
1178,IX,If I take off my heavy shoon and wade you childishly?
1179,IX,
1180,IX,"O take them off, and come to me."
1181,IX,You shall not fall.  Step merrily!
1182,IX,
1183,IX,"But, cool brook, but, quick brook, and what if I should float"
1184,IX,"White-bodied in your pleasant pool, your bubbles at my throat?"
1185,IX,
1186,IX,"If you are but a mortal maid,"
1187,IX,Then I shall make you half afraid.
1188,IX,"The water shall be dim and deep,"
1189,IX,And silver fish shall lunge and leap
1190,IX,"About you, coward mortal thing."
1191,IX,But if you come desiring
1192,IX,"To win once more your naiadhood,"
1193,IX,How you shall laugh and find me good --
1194,IX,"My golden surfaces, my glooms,"
1195,IX,"My secret grottoes' dripping rooms,"
1196,IX,"My depths of warm wet emerald,"
1197,IX,My mosses floating fold on fold!
1198,IX,And where I take the rocky leap
1199,IX,Like wild white water shall you sweep;
1200,IX,"Like wild white water shall you cry,"
1201,IX,"Trembling and turning to the sky,"
1202,IX,While all the thousand-fringed trees
1203,IX,Glimmer and glisten through the breeze.
1204,IX,"I bid you come!  Too long, too long,"
1205,IX,You have forgot my undersong.
1206,IX,And this perchance you never knew:
1207,IX,"E'en I, the brook, have need of you."
1208,IX,"My naiads faded long ago, --"
1209,IX,"My little nymphs, that to and fro"
1210,IX,Within my waters sunnily
1211,IX,Made small white flames of tinkling glee.
1212,IX,"I have been lonesome, lonesome; yea,"
1213,IX,"E'en I, the brook, until this day."
1214,IX,"Cast off your shoon; ah, come to me,"
1215,IX,And I will love you lingeringly!
1216,IX,
1217,IX,"O wild brook, O wise brook, I cannot come, alas!"
1218,IX,"I am but mortal as the leaves that flicker, float, and pass."
1219,IX,My body is not used to you; my breath is fluttering sore;
1220,IX,"You clasp me round too icily.  Ah, let me go once more!"
1221,IX,Would God I were a naiad-thing whereon Pan's music blew;
1222,IX,"But woe is me! you pagan brook, I cannot stay with you!"

1232,IX,"Hid beneath the waxen leaf,"
1233,IX,"Growling at his fairy host,"
1234,IX,Bidding her with angry boast
1235,IX,Fill his cup with wine distilled
1236,IX,From the dew the dawn has spilled:
1237,IX,Stored away in golden casks
1238,IX,Is the precious draught he asks.
1239,IX,
1240,IX,"Who, -- who makes this mimic din"
1241,IX,"In this mimic meadow inn,"
1242,IX,"Sings in such a drowsy note,"
1243,IX,Wears a golden-belted coat;
1244,IX,Loiters in the dainty room
1245,IX,Of this tavern of perfume;
1246,IX,Dares to linger at the cup
1247,IX,Till the yellow sun is up?
1248,IX,
1249,IX,"Bacchus 't is, come back again"
1250,IX,To the busy haunts of men;
1251,IX,"Garlanded and gaily dressed,"
1252,IX,Bands of gold about his breast;
1253,IX,"Straying from his paradise,"
1254,IX,"Having pinions angel-wise, --"

1312,IX,"Grow, grow, thou little tree,"
1313,IX,His body at the roots of thee;
1314,IX,Since last year's loveliness in death
1315,IX,The living beauty nourisheth.
1316,IX,
1317,IX,"Bloom, bloom, thou little tree,"
1318,IX,Thy roots around the heart of me;
1319,IX,Thou canst not blow too white and fair
1320,IX,From all the sweetness hidden there.
1321,IX,
1322,IX,"Die, die, thou little tree,"
1323,IX,And be as all sweet things must be;
1324,IX,"Deep where thy petals drift I, too,"
1325,IX,Would rest the changing seasons through.

1334,IX,"For a name unknown,"
1335,IX,Whose fame unblown
1336,IX,Sleeps in the hills
1337,IX,For ever and aye;
1338,IX,
1339,IX,For her who hears
1340,IX,The stir of the years
1341,IX,Go by on the wind
1342,IX,By night and day;
1343,IX,
1344,IX,And heeds no thing
1345,IX,"Of the needs of Spring,"
1346,IX,Of Autumn's wonder
1347,IX,Or Winter's chill;
1348,IX,
1349,IX,For one who sees
1350,IX,"The great sun freeze,"
1351,IX,As he wanders a-cold
1352,IX,From hill to hill;
1353,IX,
1354,IX,And all her heart
1355,IX,Is a woven part
1356,IX,Of the flurry and drift
1357,IX,Of whirling snow;
1358,IX,
1359,IX,For the sake of two
1360,IX,"Sad eyes and true,"
1361,IX,"And the old, old love"
1362,IX,So long ago.

1367,IX,The Wife from Fairyland.  [Richard Le Gallienne]
1368,IX,
1369,IX,
1370,IX,
1371,IX,"Her talk was all of woodland things,"
1372,IX,Of little lives that pass
1373,IX,"Away in one green afternoon,"
1374,IX,Deep in the haunted grass;
1375,IX,
1376,IX,"For she had come from fairyland,"
1377,IX,The morning of a day
1378,IX,When the world that still was April
1379,IX,Was turning into May.
1380,IX,
1381,IX,Green leaves and silence and two eyes --
1382,IX,"'T was so she seemed to me,"
1383,IX,"A silver shadow of the woods,"
1384,IX,Whisper and mystery.
1385,IX,
1386,IX,"I looked into her woodland eyes,"
1387,IX,"And all my heart was hers,"
1388,IX,And then I led her by the hand
1389,IX,Home up my marble stairs;
1390,IX,
1391,IX,And all my granite and my gold
1392,IX,"Was hers for her green eyes,"
1393,IX,And all my sinful heart was hers
1394,IX,From sunset to sunrise;
1395,IX,
1396,IX,I gave her all delight and ease
1397,IX,"That God had given to me,"
1398,IX,"I listened to fulfill her dreams,"
1399,IX,Rapt with expectancy.
1400,IX,
1401,IX,"But all I gave, and all I did,"
1402,IX,Brought but a weary smile
1403,IX,Of gratitude upon her face;
1404,IX,"As though a little while,"
1405,IX,
1406,IX,She loitered in magnificence
1407,IX,Of marble and of gold
1408,IX,And waited to be home again
1409,IX,When the dull tale was told.
1410,IX,
1411,IX,"Sometimes, in the chill galleries,"
1412,IX,"Unseen, she deemed, unheard,"
1413,IX,I found her dancing like a leaf
1414,IX,And singing like a bird.
1415,IX,
1416,IX,So lone a thing I never saw
1417,IX,"In lonely earth or sky,"
1418,IX,"So merry and so sad a thing,"
1419,IX,"One sad, one laughing, eye."
1420,IX,
1421,IX,There came a day when on her heart
1422,IX,"A wildwood blossom lay,"
1423,IX,And the world that still was April
1424,IX,Was turning into May.
1425,IX,
1426,IX,In the green eyes I saw a smile
1427,IX,That turned my heart to stone:
1428,IX,My wife that came from fairyland
1429,IX,No longer was alone.
1430,IX,
1431,IX,For there had come a little hand
1432,IX,"To show the green way home,"
1433,IX,"Home through the leaves, home through the dew,"
1434,IX,Home through the greenwood -- home.

1440,IX,
1441,IX,
1442,IX,
1443,IX,"Life burns us up like fire,"
1444,IX,And Song goes up in flame:
1445,IX,The radiant body smoulders
1446,IX,To the ashes whence it came.
1447,IX,
1448,IX,Out of things it rises
1449,IX,"With a mouth that laughs and sings,"
1450,IX,Backward it fades and falters
1451,IX,Into the char of things.
1452,IX,
1453,IX,Yet soars a voice above it --
1454,IX,Love is holy and strong;
1455,IX,The best of us forever
1456,IX,Escapes in Love and Song.
1457,IX,

1463,IX,
1464,IX,
1465,IX,"Song is so old,"
1466,IX,Love is so new --
1467,IX,Let me be still
1468,IX,And kneel to you.
1469,IX,
1470,IX,Let me be still
1471,IX,"And breathe no word,"
1472,IX,Save what my warm blood
1473,IX,Sings unheard.
1474,IX,
1475,IX,Let my warm blood
1476,IX,Sing low of you --
1477,IX,"Song is so fair,"
1478,IX,Love is so new!

1483,IX,That Day you came.  [Lizette Woodworth Reese]
1484,IX,
1485,IX,
1486,IX,
1487,IX,Such special sweetness was about
1488,IX,"That day God sent you here,"
1489,IX,"I knew the lavender was out,"
1490,IX,And it was mid of year.
1491,IX,
1492,IX,"Their common way the great winds blew,"
1493,IX,The ships sailed out to sea;
1494,IX,Yet ere that day was spent I knew
1495,IX,Mine own had come to me.
1496,IX,
1497,IX,As after song some snatch of tune
1498,IX,"Lurks still in grass or bough,"
1499,IX,"So, somewhat of the end o' June"
1500,IX,Lurks in each weather now.
1501,IX,
1502,IX,"The young year sets the buds astir,"
1503,IX,The old year strips the trees;
1504,IX,But ever in my lavender
1505,IX,I hear the brawling bees.

1511,IX,
1512,IX,
1513,IX,
1514,IX,For me the jasmine buds unfold
1515,IX,"And silver daisies star the lea,"
1516,IX,"The crocus hoards the sunset gold,"
1517,IX,And the wild rose breathes for me.
1518,IX,"I feel the sap through the bough returning,"
1519,IX,"I share the skylark's transport fine,"
1520,IX,"I know the fountain's wayward yearning,"
1521,IX,"I love, and the world is mine!"
1522,IX,
1523,IX,"I love, and thoughts that sometime grieved,"
1524,IX,"Still well remembered, grieve not me;"
1525,IX,From all that darkened and deceived
1526,IX,Upsoars my spirit free.
1527,IX,"For soft the hours repeat one story,"
1528,IX,Sings the sea one strain divine;
1529,IX,My clouds arise all flushed with glory --
1530,IX,"I love, and the world is mine!"

1539,IX,"I have praised many loved ones in my song,"
1540,IX,And yet I stand
1541,IX,"Before her shrine, to whom all things belong,"
1542,IX,With empty hand.
1543,IX,
1544,IX,Perhaps the ripening future holds a time
1545,IX,For things unsaid;
1546,IX,Not now; men do not celebrate in rhyme
1547,IX,Their daily bread.

1560,I,
1561,I,"My mother's hands are cool and fair,"
1562,I,They can do anything.
1563,I,Delicate mercies hide them there
1564,I,Like flowers in the spring.
1565,I,
1566,I,"When I was small and could not sleep,"
1567,I,"She used to come to me,"
1568,I,And with my cheek upon her hand
1569,I,How sure my rest would be.
1570,I,
1571,I,For everything she ever touched
1572,I,"Of beautiful or fine,"
1573,I,Their memories living in her hands
1574,I,Would warm that sleep of mine.
1575,I,
1576,I,Her hands remember how they played
1577,I,"One time in meadow streams, --"
1578,I,And all the flickering song and shade
1579,I,Of water took my dreams.
1580,I,
1581,I,Swift through her haunted fingers pass
1582,I,Memories of garden things; --
1583,I,I dipped my face in flowers and grass
1584,I,And sounds of hidden wings.
1585,I,
1586,I,One time she touched the cloud that kissed
1587,I,Brown pastures bleak and far; --
1588,I,I leaned my cheek into a mist
1589,I,And thought I was a star.
1590,I,
1591,I,All this was very long ago
1592,I,And I am grown; but yet
1593,I,The hand that lured my slumber so
1594,I,I never can forget.
1595,I,
1596,I,For still when drowsiness comes on
1597,I,"It seems so soft and cool,"
1598,I,"Shaped happily beneath my cheek,"
1599,I,Hollow and beautiful.

1604,II,
1605,II,Her Words
1606,II,
1607,II,
1608,II,My mother has the prettiest tricks
1609,II,Of words and words and words.
1610,II,Her talk comes out as smooth and sleek
1611,II,As breasts of singing birds.
1612,II,
1613,II,She shapes her speech all silver fine
1614,II,Because she loves it so.
1615,II,And her own eyes begin to shine
1616,II,To hear her stories grow.
1617,II,
1618,II,And if she goes to make a call
1619,II,Or out to take a walk
1620,II,We leave our work when she returns
1621,II,And run to hear her talk.
1622,II,
1623,II,We had not dreamed these things were so
1624,II,Of sorrow and of mirth.
1625,II,Her speech is as a thousand eyes
1626,II,Through which we see the earth.
1627,II,
1628,II,"God wove a web of loveliness,"
1629,II,"Of clouds and stars and birds,"
1630,II,But made not any thing at all
1631,II,So beautiful as words.
1632,II,
1633,II,They shine around our simple earth
1634,II,"With golden shadowings,"
1635,II,And every common thing they touch
1636,II,Is exquisite with wings.
1637,II,
1638,II,There's nothing poor and nothing small
1639,II,But is made fair with them.
1640,II,They are the hands of living faith
1641,II,That touch the garment's hem.
1642,II,
1643,II,"They are as fair as bloom or air,"
1644,II,"They shine like any star,"
1645,II,And I am rich who learned from her
1646,II,How beautiful they are.

1652,II,
1653,II,
1654,II,
1655,II,"This, then, is she,"
1656,II,"My mother as she looked at seventeen,"
1657,II,"When she first met my father.  Young incredibly,"
1658,II,"Younger than spring, without the faintest trace"
1659,II,"Of disappointment, weariness, or tean"
1660,II,Upon the childlike earnestness and grace
1661,II,Of the waiting face.
1662,II,Those close-wound ropes of pearl
1663,II,(Or common beads made precious by their use)
1664,II,Seem heavy for so slight a throat to wear;
1665,II,But the low bodice leaves the shoulders bare
1666,II,"And half the glad swell of the breast, for news"
1667,II,That now the woman stirs within the girl.
1668,II,"And yet,"
1669,II,"Even so, the loops and globes"
1670,II,Of beaten gold
1671,II,And jet
1672,II,"Hung, in the stately way of old,"
1673,II,From the ears' drooping lobes
1674,II,"On festivals and Lord's-day of the week,"
1675,II,"Show all too matron-sober for the cheek, --"
1676,II,"Which, now I look again, is perfect child,"
1677,II,"Or no -- or no -- 't is girlhood's very self,"
1678,II,"Moulded by some deep, mischief-ridden elf"
1679,II,"So meek, so maiden mild,"
1680,II,But startling the close gazer with the sense
1681,II,"Of passions forest-shy and forest-wild,"
1682,II,And delicate delirious merriments.
1683,II,
1684,II,As a moth beats sidewise
1685,II,"And up and over, and tries"
1686,II,To skirt the irresistible lure
1687,II,"Of the flame that has him sure,"
1688,II,"My spirit, that is none too strong to-day,"
1689,II,"Flutters and makes delay, --"
1690,II,"Pausing to wonder on the perfect lips,"
1691,II,Lifting to muse upon the low-drawn hair
1692,II,"And each hid radiance there,"
1693,II,"But powerless to stem the tide-race bright,"
1694,II,The vehement peace which drifts it toward the light
1695,II,"Where soon -- ah, now, with cries"
1696,II,Of grief and giving-up unto its gain
1697,II,"It shrinks no longer nor denies,"
1698,II,But dips
1699,II,"Hurriedly home to the exquisite heart of pain, --"
1700,II,"And all is well, for I have seen them plain,"
1701,II,"The unforgettable, the unforgotten eyes!"
1702,II,Across the blinding gush of these good tears
1703,II,They shine as in the sweet and heavy years
1704,II,When by her bed and chair
1705,II,We children gathered jealously to share
1706,II,"The sunlit aura breathing myrrh and thyme,"
1707,II,Where the sore-stricken body made a clime
1708,II,"Gentler than May and pleasanter than rhyme,"
1709,II,Holier and more mystical than prayer.
1710,II,
1711,II,"God, how thy ways are strange!"
1712,II,"That this should be, even this,"
1713,II,The patient head
1714,II,Which suffered years ago the dreary change!
1715,II,That these so dewy lips should be the same
1716,II,As those I stooped to kiss
1717,II,"And heard my harrowing half-spoken name,"
1718,II,"A little ere the one who bowed above her,"
1719,II,"Our father and her very constant lover,"
1720,II,"Rose stoical, and we knew that she was dead."
1721,II,"Then I, who could not understand or share"
1722,II,"His antique nobleness,"
1723,II,Being unapt to bear
1724,II,"The insults which time flings us for our proof,"
1725,II,Fled from the horrible roof
1726,II,"Into the alien sunshine merciless,"
1727,II,"The shrill satiric fields ghastly with day,"
1728,II,Raging to front God in his pride of sway
1729,II,And hurl across the lifted swords of fate
1730,II,That ringed Him where He sat
1731,II,My puny gage of scorn and desolate hate
1732,II,"Which somehow should undo Him, after all!"
1733,II,"That this girl face, expectant, virginal,"
1734,II,Which gazes out at me
1735,II,"Boon as a sweetheart, as if nothing loth"
1736,II,"(Save for the eyes, with other presage stored)"
1737,II,"To pledge me troth,"
1738,II,And in the kingdom where the heart is lord
1739,II,Take sail on the terrible gladness of the deep
1740,II,"Whose winds the gray Norns keep, --"
1741,II,That this should be indeed
1742,II,"The flesh which caught my soul, a flying seed,"
1743,II,Out of the to and fro
1744,II,"Of scattering hands where the seedsman Mage,"
1745,II,Stooping from star to star and age to age
1746,II,Sings as he sows!
1747,II,That underneath this breast
1748,II,Nine moons I fed
1749,II,"Deep of divine unrest,"
1750,II,"While over and over in the dark she said,"
1751,II,"""Blessed! but not as happier children blessed"" --"
1752,II,That this should be
1753,II,Even she . . .
1754,II,"God, how with time and change"
1755,II,Thou makest thy footsteps strange!
1756,II,"Ah, now I know"
1757,II,"They play upon me, and it is not so."
1758,II,"Why, 't is a girl I never saw before,"
1759,II,"A little thing to flatter and make weep,"
1760,II,"To tease until her heart is sore,"
1761,II,Then kiss and clear the score;
1762,II,"A gypsy run-the-fields,"
1763,II,"A little liberal daughter of the earth,"
1764,II,Good for what hour of truancy and mirth
1765,II,The careless season yields
1766,II,Hither-side the flood of the year and yonder of the neap;
1767,II,"Then thank you, thanks again, and twenty light good-byes. --"
1768,II,"O shrined above the skies,"
1769,II,"Frown not, clear brow,"
1770,II,"Darken not, holy eyes!"
1771,II,Thou knowest well I know that it is thou
1772,II,Only to save me from such memories
1773,II,"As would unman me quite,"
1774,II,Here in this web of strangeness caught
1775,II,And prey to troubled thought
1776,II,Do I devise
1777,II,These foolish shifts and slight;
1778,II,Only to shield me from the afflicting sense
1779,II,Of some waste influence
1780,II,Which from this morning face and lustrous hair
1781,II,Breathes on me sudden ruin and despair.
1782,II,"In any other guise,"
1783,II,"With any but this girlish depth of gaze,"
1784,II,Your coming had not so unsealed and poured
1785,II,The dusty amphoras where I had stored
1786,II,The drippings of the winepress of my days.
1787,II,"I think these eyes foresee,"
1788,II,"Now in their unawakened virgin time,"
1789,II,"Their mother's pride in me,"
1790,II,"And dream even now, unconsciously,"
1791,II,Upon each soaring peak and sky-hung lea
1792,II,You pictured I should climb.
1793,II,"Broken premonitions come,"
1794,II,"Shapes, gestures visionary,"
1795,II,Not as once to maiden Mary
1796,II,The manifest angel with fresh lilies came
1797,II,Intelligibly calling her by name;
1798,II,"But vanishingly, dumb,"
1799,II,"Thwarted and bright and wild,"
1800,II,"As heralding a sin-defiled,"
1801,II,"Earth-encumbered, blood-begotten, passionate man-child,"
1802,II,Who yet should be a trump of mighty call
1803,II,Blown in the gates of evil kings
1804,II,To make them fall;
1805,II,Who yet should be a sword of flame before
1806,II,The soul's inviolate door
1807,II,To beat away the clang of hellish wings;
1808,II,Who yet should be a lyre
1809,II,Of high unquenchable desire
1810,II,In the day of little things. --
1811,II,"Look, where the amphoras,"
1812,II,"The yield of many days,"
1813,II,"Trod by my hot soul from the pulp of self,"
1814,II,And set upon the shelf
1815,II,In sullen pride
1816,II,The Vineyard-master's tasting to abide --
1817,II,O mother mine!
1818,II,"Are these the bringings-in, the doings fine,"
1819,II,Of him you used to praise?
1820,II,Emptied and overthrown
1821,II,The jars lie strown.
1822,II,"These, for their flavor duly nursed,"
1823,II,Drip from the stopples vinegar accursed;
1824,II,"These, I thought honied to the very seal,"
1825,II,"Dry, dry, -- a little acid meal,"
1826,II,"A pinch of mouldy dust,"
1827,II,Sole leavings of the amber-mantling must;
1828,II,"These, rude to look upon,"
1829,II,"But flasking up the liquor dearest won,"
1830,II,"Through sacred hours and hard,"
1831,II,"With watching and with wrestlings and with grief,"
1832,II,"Even of these, of these in chief,"
1833,II,The stale breath sickens reeking from the shard.
1834,II,"Nothing is left.  Aye, how much less than naught!"
1835,II,What shall be said or thought
1836,II,"Of the slack hours and waste imaginings,"
1837,II,"The cynic rending of the wings,"
1838,II,"Known to that froward, that unreckoning heart"
1839,II,"Whereof this brewage was the precious part,"
1840,II,Treasured and set away with furtive boast?
1841,II,"O dear and cruel ghost,"
1842,II,"Be merciful, be just!"
1843,II,"See, I was yours and I am in the dust."
1844,II,"Then look not so, as if all things were well!"
1845,II,"Take your eyes from me, leave me to my shame,"
1846,II,"Or else, if gaze they must,"
1847,II,"Steel them with judgment, darken them with blame;"
1848,II,But by the ways of light ineffable
1849,II,"You bade me go and I have faltered from,"
1850,II,By the low waters moaning out of hell
1851,II,"Whereto my feet have come,"
1852,II,Lay not on me these intolerable
1853,II,"Looks of rejoicing love, of pride, of happy trust!"
1854,II,
1855,II,Nothing dismayed?
1856,II,By all I say and all I hint not made
1857,II,Afraid?
1858,II,"O then, stay by me!  Let"
1859,II,"These eyes afflict me, cleanse me, keep me yet,"
1860,II,Brave eyes and true!
1861,II,"See how the shrivelled heart, that long has lain"
1862,II,"Dead to delight and pain,"
1863,II,"Stirs, and begins again"
1864,II,"To utter pleasant life, as if it knew"
1865,II,The wintry days were through;
1866,II,As if in its awakening boughs it heard
1867,II,"The quick, sweet-spoken bird."
1868,II,"Strong eyes and brave,"
1869,II,Inexorable to save!

1878,II,When I consider Life and its few years --
1879,II,A wisp of fog betwixt us and the sun;
1880,II,"A call to battle, and the battle done"
1881,II,Ere the last echo dies within our ears;
1882,II,A rose choked in the grass; an hour of fears;
1883,II,The gusts that past a darkening shore do beat;
1884,II,"The burst of music down an unlistening street, --"
1885,II,I wonder at the idleness of tears.
1886,II,"Ye old, old dead, and ye of yesternight,"
1887,II,"Chieftains, and bards, and keepers of the sheep,"
1888,II,"By every cup of sorrow that you had,"
1889,II,"Loose me from tears, and make me see aright"

1904,II,
1905,II,Would I were with my first love
1906,II,To hear the rush and roar
1907,II,Of spume below the doorstep
1908,II,And winds upon the door.
1909,II,
1910,II,My first love was a fair girl
1911,II,With ways forever new;
1912,II,"And hair a sunlight yellow,"
1913,II,And eyes a morning blue.
1914,II,
1915,II,"The roses, have they tarried"
1916,II,Or are they dun and frayed?

1918,II,"Would love, indeed, have stayed?"
1919,II,
1920,II,"Ah, years are filled with learning,"
1921,II,And days are leaves of change!
1922,II,And I have met so many
1923,II,I knew . . . and found them strange.
1924,II,
1925,II,But on the sea-lands tumbled
1926,II,"By winds that sting and blind,"
1927,II,"The nights we watched, so silent,"
1928,II,"Come back, come back to mind."
1929,II,
1930,II,"I mind about my first love,"
1931,II,And hear the rush and roar

1945,II,A piper play.
1946,II,
1947,II,"Along the dipping deck he trod,"
1948,II,The dusk about his shadowy form;
1949,II,He seemed like some strange ancient god
1950,II,Of song and storm.
1951,II,
1952,II,He gave his dim-seen pipes a skirl
1953,II,And war went down the darkling air;
1954,II,"Then came a sudden subtle swirl,"
1955,II,And love was there.
1956,II,
1957,II,What were the winds that flailed and flayed
1958,II,"The sea to him, the night obscure?"
1959,II,"In dreams he strayed some brackened glade,"

1961,II,

1966,II,
1967,II,"And so amid the deep sea din,"

2067,II,"The may-trees reach and glimmer, near or far,"
2068,II,And the red may-trees wear a shining veil.
2069,II,"And still, no nightingale!"
2070,II,
2071,II,"The one vain longing, -- through all journeyings,"
2072,II,"The one:  in every hushed and hearkening spot, --"
2073,II,"All the soft-swarming dark where you were not,"
2074,II,"Still longed for!  Yes, for sake of dreams and wings,"
2075,II,"And wonders, that your own must ever make"
2076,II,"To bower you close, with all hearts' treasurings;"
2077,II,And for that speech toward which all hearts do ache; --
2078,II,Even for Music's sake.
2079,II,
2080,II,"But most, his music whose beloved name"
2081,II,"Forever writ in water of bright tears,"
2082,II,"Wins to one grave-side even the Roman years,"
2083,II,That kindle there the hallowed April flame
2084,II,Of comfort-breathing violets.  By that shrine
2085,II,"Of Youth, Love, Death, forevermore the same,"
2086,II,"Violets still! --  When falls, to leave no sign,"
2087,II,The arch of Constantine.
2088,II,
2089,II,"Most for his sake we dreamed.  Tho' not as he,"
2090,II,"From that lone spirit, brimmed with human woe,"
2091,II,Your song once shook to surging overflow.
2092,II,"How was it, sovran dweller of the tree,"
2093,II,"His cry, still throbbing in the flooded shell"
2094,II,"Of silence with remembered melody,"
2095,II,Could draw from you no answer to the spell?
2096,II,"-- O Voice, O Philomel?"
2097,II,
2098,II,Long time we wondered (and we knew not why): --
2099,II,"Nor dream, nor prayer, of wayside gladness born,"
2100,II,"Nor vineyards waiting, nor reproachful thorn,"
2101,II,Nor yet the nested hill-towns set so high
2102,II,"All the white way beside the girdling blue, --"
2103,II,"Nor olives, gray against a golden sky,"
2104,II,Could serve to wake that rapturous voice of you!
2105,II,But the wise silence knew.
2106,II,
2107,II,"O Nightingale unheard! --  Unheard alone,"
2108,II,Throughout that woven music of the days
2109,II,"From the faint sea-rim to the market-place,"
2110,II,And ring of hammers on cathedral stone!
2111,II,"So be it, better so:  that there should fail"
2112,II,"For sun-filled ones, one blessed thing unknown."
2113,II,"To them, be hid forever, -- and all hail!"
2114,II,"Sing never, Nightingale."
2115,II,
2116,II,"Sing, for the others!  Sing; to some pale cheek"
2117,II,"Against the window, like a starving flower."
2118,II,"Loose, with your singing, one poor pilgrim hour"
2119,II,"Of journey, with some Heart's Desire to seek."
2120,II,"Loose, with your singing, captives such as these"
2121,II,"In misery and iron, hearts too meek,"
2122,II,For voyage -- voyage over dreamful seas
2123,II,To lost Hesperides.
2124,II,
2125,II,"Sing not for free-men.  Ah, but sing for whom"
2126,II,"The walls shut in; and even as eyes that fade,"
2127,II,"The windows take no heed of light nor shade, --"
2128,II,The leaves are lost in mutterings of the loom.
2129,II,Sing near!  So in that golden overflowing
2130,II,They may forget their wasted human bloom;
2131,II,"Pay the devouring days their all, unknowing, --"
2132,II,Reck not of life's bright going!
2133,II,
2134,II,"Sing not for lovers, side by side that hark;"
2135,II,"Nor unto parted lovers, save they be"
2136,II,"Parted indeed by more than makes the Sea,"
2137,II,Where never hope shall meet -- like mounting lark --
2138,II,Far Joy's uprising; and no memories
2139,II,Abide to star the music-haunted dark:
2140,II,"To them that sit in darkness, such as these,"
2141,II,"Pour down, pour down heart's-ease."
2142,II,
2143,II,Not in Kings' gardens.  No; but where there haunt
2144,II,"The world's forgotten, both of men and birds;"
2145,II,"The alleys of no hope and of no words,"
2146,II,"The hidings where men reap not, though they plant;"
2147,II,But toil and thirst -- so dying and so born; --
2148,II,"And toil and thirst to gather to their want,"
2149,II,"From the lean waste, beyond the daylight's scorn,"
2150,II,-- To gather grapes of thorn!
2151,II,
2152,II,.    .    .    .    .
2153,II,
2154,II,"And for those two, your pilgrims without tears,"
2155,II,"Who prayed a largess where there was no dearth,"
2156,II,Forgive it to their human-happy ears:
2157,II,"Forgive it them, brown music of the Earth,"
2158,II,"Unknowing, -- though the wiser silence knew!"
2159,II,Forgive it to the music of the spheres
2160,II,"That while they walked together so, the Two"
2161,II,"Together, -- heard not you."

2170,II,"Only of thee and me the night wind sings,"
2171,II,"Only of us the sailors speak at sea,"
2172,II,The earth is filled with wondered whisperings
2173,II,Only of thee and me.
2174,II,
2175,II,"Only of thee and me the breakers chant,"
2176,II,Only of us the stir in bush and tree;
2177,II,The rain and sunshine tell the eager plant
2178,II,Only of thee and me.
2179,II,
2180,II,"Only of thee and me, till all shall fade;"
2181,II,Only of us the whole world's thoughts can be --
2182,II,"For we are Love, and God Himself is made"
2183,II,Only of thee and me.

2189,II,
2190,II,
2191,II,
2192,II,"When the wind is low, and the sea is soft,"
2193,II,And the far heat-lightning plays
2194,II,On the rim of the west where dark clouds nest
2195,II,On a darker bank of haze;
2196,II,When I lean o'er the rail with you that I love
2197,II,And gaze to my heart's content;
2198,II,I know that the heavens are there above --
2199,II,But you are my firmament.
2200,II,
2201,II,When the phosphor-stars are thrown from the bow
2202,II,And the watch climbs up the shroud;
2203,II,When the dim mast dips as the vessel slips
2204,II,Through the foam that seethes aloud;
2205,II,"I know that the years of our life are few,"
2206,II,"And fain as a bird to flee,"
2207,II,That time is as brief as a drop of dew --
2208,II,But you are Eternity.

2214,II,
2215,II,
2216,II,
2217,II,Helen's lips are drifting dust;
2218,II,Ilion is consumed with rust;
2219,II,All the galleons of Greece
2220,II,Drink the ocean's dreamless peace;
2221,II,Lost was Solomon's purple show
2222,II,Restless centuries ago;
2223,II,Stately empires wax and wane --
2224,II,"Babylon, Barbary, and Spain; --"
2225,II,"Only one thing, undefaced,"
2226,II,"Lasts, though all the worlds lie waste"
2227,II,And the heavens are overturned.
2228,II,"Dear, how long ago we learned!"
2229,II,
2230,II,"There's a sight that blinds the sun,"
2231,II,"Sound that lives when sounds are done,"
2232,II,"Music that rebukes the birds,"
2233,II,"Language lovelier than words,"
2234,II,"Hue and scent that shame the rose,"
2235,II,"Wine no earthly vineyard knows,"
2236,II,Silence stiller than the shore
2237,II,"Swept by Charon's stealthy oar,"
2238,II,Ocean more divinely free
2239,II,"Than Pacific's boundless sea, --"
2240,II,Ye who love have learned it true.

2247,II,
2248,II,
2249,II,
2250,II,Be still.  The Hanging Gardens were a dream
2251,II,That over Persian roses flew to kiss
2252,II,The curled lashes of Semiramis.
2253,II,"Troy never was, nor green Skamander stream."
2254,II,"Provence and Troubadour are merest lies,"
2255,II,The glorious hair of Venice was a beam
2256,II,"Made within Titian's eye.  The sunsets seem,"
2257,II,The world is very old and nothing is.
2258,II,"Be still.  Thou foolish thing, thou canst not wake,"
2259,II,"Nor thy tears wedge thy soldered lids apart,"
2260,II,But patter in the darkness of thy heart.
2261,II,Thy brain is plagued.  Thou art a frighted owl
2262,II,"Blind with the light of life thou'ldst not forsake,"
2263,II,And Error loves and nourishes thy soul.

2268,II,The Tears of Harlequin.  [Theodosia Garrison]
2269,II,
2270,II,
2271,II,
2272,II,"To you he gave his laughter and his jest,"
2273,II,"His words that of all words were merriest,"
2274,II,"His glad, mad moments when the lights flared high"
2275,II,And his wild song outshrilled the plaudits' din.
2276,II,"For you that memory, but happier I --"
2277,II,"I, who have known the tears of Harlequin."
2278,II,
2279,II,Not mine those moments when the roses lay
2280,II,"Like red spilled wine on his triumphant way,"
2281,II,"And shouts acclaimed him through the music's beat,"
2282,II,Above the voice of flute and violin.
2283,II,But I have known his hour of sore defeat --
2284,II,I -- I have known the tears of Harlequin.
2285,II,
2286,II,"Light kisses and light words, they were not mine --"
2287,II,Poor perquisites of many a Columbine
2288,II,"Bought with his laughter, flattered by his jest;"
2289,II,"But when despair broke through the painted grin,"
2290,II,His tortured face has fallen on my breast --
2291,II,I -- I have known the tears of Harlequin.
2292,II,
2293,II,"You weep for him, who look upon him dead,"
2294,II,That joy and jest and merriment are fled;
2295,II,"You weep for him, what time my eyes are dry,"
2296,II,Knowing what peace a weary soul may win
2297,II,Stifled by too much masking -- even I --
2298,II,"I, who have known the tears of Harlequin."

2304,II,
2305,II,
2306,II,
2307,II,My heart is like a city of the gay
2308,II,Reared on the ruins of a perished one
2309,II,"Wherein my dead loves cower from the sun,"
2310,II,"White-swathed like kings, the Pharaohs of a day."
2311,II,"Within the buried city stirs no sound,"
2312,II,"Save for the bat, forgetful of the rod,"
2313,II,"Perched on the knee of some deserted god,"
2314,II,And for the groan of rivers underground.
2315,II,
2316,II,"Stray not, my Love, 'mid the sarcophagi --"
2317,II,"Tempt not the silence, for the fates are deep,"
2318,II,"Lest all the dreamers, deeming doomsday nigh,"
2319,II,Leap forth in terror from their haunted sleep;
2320,II,And like the peal of an accursed bell
2321,II,Thy voice call ghosts of dead things back from hell.

2326,II,The Ride to the Lady.  [Helen Gray Cone]
2327,II,
2328,II,
2329,II,
2330,II,"""Now since mine even is come at last, --"
2331,II,"For I have been the sport of steel,"
2332,II,"And hot life ebbeth from me fast,"
2333,II,"And I in saddle roll and reel, --"
2334,II,"Come bind me, bind me on my steed!"
2335,II,"Of fingering leech I have no need!"""
2336,II,The chaplain clasped his mailed knee.
2337,II,"""Nor need I more thy whine and thee!"
2338,II,No time is left my sins to tell;
2339,II,"But look ye bind me, bind me well!"""
2340,II,"They bound him strong with leathern thong,"
2341,II,For the ride to the lady should be long.
2342,II,
2343,II,"Day was dying; the poplars fled,"
2344,II,"Thin as ghosts, on a sky blood-red;"
2345,II,"Out of the sky the fierce hue fell,"
2346,II,And made the streams as the streams of hell.
2347,II,"All his thoughts as a river flowed,"
2348,II,"Flowed aflame as fleet he rode,"
2349,II,"Onward flowed to her abode,"
2350,II,"Ceased at her feet, mirrored her face."
2351,II,"(Viewless Death apace, apace,"
2352,II,Rode behind him in that race.)
2353,II,
2354,II,"""Face, mine own, mine alone,"
2355,II,"Trembling lips my lips have known,"
2356,II,Birdlike stir of the dove-soft eyne
2357,II,Under the kisses that make them mine!
2358,II,"Only of thee, of thee, my need!"
2359,II,"Only to thee, to thee, I speed!"""
2360,II,The Cross flashed by at the highway's turn;
2361,II,In a beam of the moon the Face shone stern.
2362,II,
2363,II,Far behind had the fight's din died;
2364,II,The shuddering stars in the welkin wide
2365,II,"Crowded, crowded, to see him ride."
2366,II,The beating hearts of the stars aloof
2367,II,Kept time to the beat of the horse's hoof.
2368,II,"""What is the throb that thrills so sweet?"
2369,II,"Heart of my lady, I feel it beat!"""
2370,II,"But his own strong pulse the fainter fell,"
2371,II,Like the failing tongue of a hushing bell.
2372,II,The flank of the great-limbed steed was wet
2373,II,Not alone with the started sweat.
2374,II,
2375,II,"Fast, and fast, and the thick black wood"
2376,II,Arched its cowl like a black friar's hood;
2377,II,"Fast, and fast, and they plunged therein, --"
2378,II,But the viewless rider rode to win.
2379,II,
2380,II,Out of the wood to the highway's light
2381,II,Galloped the great-limbed steed in fright;
2382,II,"The mail clashed cold, and the sad owl cried,"
2383,II,And the weight of the dead oppressed his side.
2384,II,
2385,II,"Fast, and fast, by the road he knew;"
2386,II,"And slow, and slow, the stars withdrew;"
2387,II,"And the waiting heaven turned weirdly blue,"
2388,II,As a garment worn of a wizard grim.
2389,II,He neighed at the gate in the morning dim.
2390,II,
2391,II,"She heard no sound before her gate,"
2392,II,Though very quiet was her bower.
2393,II,All was as her hand had left it late:
2394,II,"The needle slept on the broidered vine,"
2395,II,Where the hammer and spikes of the passion-flower
2396,II,Her fashioning did wait.
2397,II,
2398,II,"On the couch lay something fair,"
2399,II,With steadfast lips and veiled eyne;
2400,II,But the lady was not there.
2401,II,"On the wings of shrift and prayer,"
2402,II,"Pure as winds that winnow snow,"
2403,II,Her soul had risen twelve hours ago.
2404,II,"The burdened steed at the barred gate stood,"
2405,II,No whit the nearer to his goal.
2406,II,Now God's great grace assoil the soul
2407,II,That went out in the wood!

2416,II,"Beauty calls and gives no warning,"
2417,II,Shadows rise and wander on the day.
2418,II,"In the twilight, in the quiet evening,"
2419,II,We shall rise and smile and go away.
2420,II,Over the flaming leaves
2421,II,Freezes the sky.
2422,II,"It is the season grieves,"
2423,II,"Not you, not I."
2424,II,"All our spring-times, all our summers,"
2425,II,We have kept the longing warm within.
2426,II,Now we leave the after-comers
2427,II,To attain the dreams we did not win.
2428,II,"O we have wakened, Sweet, and had our birth,"
2429,II,And that's the end of earth;
2430,II,"And we have toiled and smiled and kept the light,"
2431,II,And that's the end of night.

2439,II,
2440,II,"Out of the purple drifts,"
2441,II,"From the shadow sea of night,"
2442,II,On tides of musk a moth uplifts
2443,II,Its weary wings of white.
2444,II,
2445,II,Is it a dream or ghost
2446,II,"Of a dream that comes to me,"
2447,II,"Here in the twilight on the coast,"
2448,II,Blue cinctured by the sea?
2449,II,
2450,II,Fashioned of foam and froth --
2451,II,"And the dream is ended soon,"
2452,II,"And lo, whence came the moon-white moth"
2453,II,Comes now the moth-white moon!

2459,II,
2460,II,
2461,II,
2462,II,"Golden pulse grew on the shore,"
2463,II,"Ferns along the hill,"
2464,II,And the red cliff roses bore
2465,II,Bees to drink their fill;
2466,II,
2467,II,Bees that from the meadows bring
2468,II,"Wine of melilot,"
2469,II,Honey-sups on golden wing
2470,II,To the garden grot.
2471,II,
2472,II,"But to me, neglected flower,"
2473,II,"Phaon will not see,"

2481,II,
2482,II,
2483,II,
2484,II,"The twilight's inner flame grows blue and deep,"
2485,II,"And in my Lesbos, over leagues of sea,"
2486,II,The temples glimmer moonwise in the trees.
2487,II,Twilight has veiled the little flower face
2488,II,"Here on my heart, but still the night is kind"
2489,II,And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast.
2490,II,Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk
2491,II,Along the surges creeping up the shore
2492,II,"When tides came in to ease the hungry beach,"
2493,II,"And running, running, till the night was black,"
2494,II,Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand
2495,II,And quiver with the winds from off the sea?
2496,II,"Ah, quietly the shingle waits the tides"
2497,II,"Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me"
2498,II,"Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest."
2499,II,I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands
2500,II,"And cried to Love, from whom the sea is sweet,"
2501,II,From whom the sea is bitterer than death.
2502,II,"Ah, Aphrodite, if I sing no more"
2503,II,"To thee, God's daughter, powerful as God,"
2504,II,It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
2505,II,To hold the added sweetness of a song.
2506,II,"There is a quiet at the heart of love,"
2507,II,And I have pierced the pain and come to peace.
2508,II,"I hold my peace, my Cleis, on my heart;"
2509,II,And softer than a little wild bird's wing
2510,II,Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth.
2511,II,"Ah, never any more when spring like fire"
2512,II,"Will flicker in the newly opened leaves,"
2513,II,Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude
2514,II,"Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus' lyre,"
2515,II,Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna's voice.
2516,II,"Ah, never with a throat that aches with song,"
2517,II,"Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring,"
2518,II,Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love
2519,II,The quiver and the crying of my heart.
2520,II,Still I remember how I strove to flee
2521,II,"The love-note of the birds, and bowed my head"
2522,II,"To hurry faster, but upon the ground"
2523,II,"I saw two winged shadows side by side,"
2524,II,And all the world's spring passion stifled me.
2525,II,"Ah, Love, there is no fleeing from thy might,"
2526,II,"No lonely place where thou hast never trod,"
2527,II,No desert thou hast left uncarpeted
2528,II,With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.
2529,II,In many guises didst thou come to me;
2530,II,"I saw thee by the maidens while they danced,"
2531,II,"Phaon allured me with a look of thine,"
2532,II,"In Anactoria I knew thy grace,"
2533,II,I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes;
2534,II,"But never wholly, soul and body mine,"
2535,II,Didst thou bid any love me as I loved.
2536,II,Now I have found the peace that fled from me;
2537,II,"Close, close, against my heart I hold my world."
2538,II,"Ah, Love that made my life a lyric cry,"
2539,II,"Ah, Love that tuned my lips to lyres of thine,"
2540,II,"I taught the world thy music, now alone"
2541,II,I sing for one who falls asleep to hear.

2547,II,
2548,II,
2549,II,
2550,II,"The harps hung up in Babylon,"
2551,II,"Their loosened strings rang on, sang on,"
2552,II,And cast their murmurs forth upon
2553,II,The roll and roar of Babylon:
2554,II,"""~Forget me, Lord, if I forget"
2555,II,"Jerusalem for Babylon,"
2556,II,If I forget the vision set
2557,II,High as the head of Lebanon
2558,II,"Is lifted over Syria yet,"
2559,II,If I forget and bow me down
2560,II,"To brutish gods of Babylon.~"""
2561,II,
2562,II,Two rivers to each other run
2563,II,"In the very midst of Babylon,"
2564,II,And swifter than their current fleets
2565,II,The restless river of the streets
2566,II,"Of Babylon, of Babylon,"
2567,II,"And Babylon's towers smite the sky,"
2568,II,But higher reeks to God most high
2569,II,The smoke of her iniquity:
2570,II,"""~But oh, betwixt the green and blue"
2571,II,To walk the hills that once we knew
2572,II,"When you were pure and I was true,~"" --"
2573,II,So rang the harps in Babylon --
2574,II,"""~Or ere along the roads of stone"
2575,II,Had led us captive one by one
2576,II,"The subtle gods of Babylon.~"""
2577,II,
2578,II,The harps hung up in Babylon
2579,II,"Hung silent till the prophet dawn,"
2580,II,When Judah's feet the highway burned
2581,II,"Back to the holy hills returned,"
2582,II,And shook their dust on Babylon.
2583,II,"In Zion's halls the wild harps rang,"
2584,II,"To Zion's walls their smitten clang,"
2585,II,"And lo! of Babylon they sang,"
2586,II,They only sang of Babylon:
2587,II,"""~Jehovah, round whose throne of awe"
2588,II,The vassal stars their orbits draw
2589,II,"Within the circle of Thy law,"
2590,II,"Canst thou make nothing what is done,"
2591,II,Or cause Thy servant to be one
2592,II,"That has not been in Babylon,"
2593,II,That has not known the power and pain
2594,II,Of life poured out like driven rain?
2595,II,I will go down and find again
2596,II,"My soul that's lost in Babylon.~"""

2606,II,"Who was the Future, died full long ago."
2607,II,"Knowledge which is the Past is folly.  Go,"
2608,II,"Poor child, and be not to thyself abhorred."
2609,II,Around thine earth sun-winged winds do blow
2610,II,And planets roll; a meteor draws his sword;
2611,II,The rainbow breaks his seven-coloured chord
2612,II,And the long strips of river-silver flow:
2613,II,Awake!  Give thyself to the lovely hours.
2614,II,"Drinking their lips, catch thou the dream in flight"
2615,II,About their fragile hairs' aerial gold.
2616,II,"Thou art divine, thou livest, -- as of old"

2624,II,
2625,II,
2626,II,
2627,II,My heart was winter-bound until
2628,II,I heard you sing;
2629,II,"O voice of Love, hush not, but fill"
2630,II,My life with Spring!
2631,II,
2632,II,My hopes were homeless things before
2633,II,I saw your eyes;
2634,II,"O smile of Love, close not the door"
2635,II,To paradise!
2636,II,
2637,II,"My dreams were bitter once, and then"
2638,II,I found them bliss;
2639,II,"O lips of Love, give me again"
2640,II,Your rose to kiss!
2641,II,
2642,II,Springtide of Love!  The secret sweet
2643,II,Is ours alone;

2654,II,"Sweet is the highroad when the skylarks call,"
2655,II,When we and Love go rambling through the land.
2656,II,"But shall we still walk gayly, hand in hand,"
2657,II,At the road's turning and the twilight's fall?
2658,II,"Then darkness shall divide us like a wall,"
2659,II,And uncouth evil nightbirds flap their wings;
2660,II,The solitude of all created things
2661,II,Will creep upon us shuddering like a pall.
2662,II,
2663,II,This is the knowledge I have wrung from pain:
2664,II,"We, yea, all lovers, are not one, but twain,"
2665,II,Each by strange wisps to strange abysses drawn;
2666,II,But through the black immensity of night
2667,II,"Love's little lantern, like a glowworm's, bright,"
2668,II,May lead our steps to some stupendous dawn.

2678,II,"Two wives had he, for his delight,"
2679,II,He kissed and clypt them all the day
2680,II,And clypt and kissed them all the night.
2681,II,Now Eve like ocean foam was white
2682,II,"And Lilith roses dipped in wine,"
2683,II,But though they were a goodly sight
2684,II,No lady is so fair as mine.
2685,II,
2686,II,To Venus some folk tribute pay
2687,II,"And Queen of Beauty she is hight,"

2692,II,"And yet I say in their despite,"
2693,II,No lady is so fair as mine.
2694,II,
2695,II,"Dame Helen caused a grievous fray,"
2696,II,"For love of her brave men did fight,"
2697,II,The eyes of her made sages fey
2698,II,And put their hearts in woeful plight.
2699,II,"To her no rhymes will I indite,"
2700,II,"For her no garlands will I twine,"

2723,II,
2724,II,"In other eyes, in other lands,"
2725,II,"In deep fair pools, new beauty lingers,"
2726,II,But like spent water in your hands
2727,II,It runs from your reluctant fingers.
2728,II,
2729,II,Ye shall not keep the singing lark
2730,II,That owes to earlier skies its duty.
2731,II,Weep not to hear along the dark
2732,II,The sound of your departing beauty.
2733,II,
2734,II,The fine and anguished ear of night
2735,II,Is tuned to hear the smallest sorrow.
2736,II,"Oh, wait until the morning light!"
2737,II,It may not seem so gone to-morrow!
2738,II,
2739,II,But honey-pale and rosy-red!
2740,II,Brief lights that made a little shining!
2741,II,Beautiful looks about us shed --
2742,II,They leave us to the old repining.
2743,II,
2744,II,Think not the watchful dim despair
2745,II,"Has come to you the first, sweet-hearted!"
2746,II,"For oh, the gold in Helen's hair!"
2747,II,And how she cried when that departed!
2748,II,
2749,II,"Perhaps that one that took the most,"
2750,II,"The swiftest borrower, wildest spender,"
2751,II,"May count, as we would not, the cost --"
2752,II,And grow more true to us and tender.
2753,II,
2754,II,Happy are we if in his eyes
2755,II,We see no shadow of forgetting.
2756,II,Nay -- if our star sinks in those skies
2757,II,We shall not wholly see its setting.
2758,II,
2759,II,Then let us laugh as do the brooks
2760,II,"That such immortal youth is ours,"
2761,II,If memory keeps for them our looks
2762,II,As fresh as are the spring-time flowers.
2763,II,
2764,II,"Oh, grieve not, Ladies, if at night"

2816,II,"Love came back at fall o' dew,"
2817,II,Playing his old part;

2842,II,"The guarded fane where love alone may peer,"
2843,II,"Ere, like young spring by summer soon outshone,"
2844,II,It trembles into death; yet comes anon
2845,II,As thoughts of spring will come though summer's here.

2847,II,"O star prelusive to a dream more fair,"
2848,II,Within my heart I'll keep a heaven for thee

2871,II,"But if at last, (hark how I whisper, Love!)"
2872,II,"You from my temple and from me should turn,"
2873,II,"I pray you chant no psalm my grief above,"

2921,II,"An' if I come not often to your bed beneath the thyme,"
2922,II,"Mayhap 't is that I'd change wi' ye, and gie my bed for thine,"
2923,II,Would like to sleep in thine.

2927,II,Ye gave me cakes and lollipops and pretty toys a score --
2928,II,I never thought I should come back and ask ye now for more.
2929,II,"Grandmither, gie me your still white hands that lie upon your breast,"

2943,II,A-callin' in the night.
2944,II,
2945,II,"Grandmither, gie me your clay-cold heart, that has forgot to ache,"

2947,II,"Wi' every beat it's callin' for things that must not be, --"
2948,II,So can ye not let me creep in an' rest awhile by ye?
2949,II,A little lass afeard o' dark slept by ye years agone --
2950,II,An' she has found what night can hold 'twixt sunset an' the dawn:

2970,II,
2971,II,This woman lived and wore life as a sword
2972,II,To conquer wisdom; this dead woman read
2973,II,In the sealed Book of Love and underscored

2976,II,Went singing down the River of the Dead.

3032,II,"O life, O life, how may we learn"
3033,II,Thy strangest mystery?
3034,II,
3035,II,"Nay, they knew not, as we scarce know;"
3036,II,"Their souls, O let them rest;"
3037,II,My life is pupil unto pain --
3038,II,With him I make my quest.

3041,III,III
3042,III,
3043,III,"My little soul I never saw,"
3044,III,Nor can I count its days;
3045,III,I do not know its wondrous law
3046,III,And yet I know its ways.
3047,III,
3048,III,"O it is young as morning-hours,"
3049,III,And old as is the night;
3050,III,"O it has growth of budding flowers,"
3051,III,Yet tastes my body's blight.
3052,III,
3053,III,"And it is silent and apart,"
3054,III,"And far and fair and still,"
3055,III,"Yet ever beats within my heart,"
3056,III,And cries within my will.
3057,III,
3058,III,"And it is light and bright and strange,"
3059,III,"And sees life far away,"
3060,III,Yet far with near can interchange
3061,III,And dwell within the day.
3062,III,
3063,III,"My soul has died a thousand deaths,"
3064,III,And yet it does not die;
3065,III,"My soul has broke a thousand faiths,"
3066,III,And yet it cannot lie;
3067,III,
3068,III,My soul -- there's naught can make it less;
3069,III,My soul -- there's naught can mar;
3070,III,Yet here it weeps with loneliness
3071,III,Within its lonely star.
3072,III,
3073,III,"My soul -- not any dark can bind,"
3074,III,"Nor hinder any hand,"
3075,III,"Yet here it weeps -- long blind, long blind --"
3076,III,And cannot understand.

3083,III,
3084,III,
3085,III,"I try to knead and spin, but my life is low the while."
3086,III,"Oh, I long to be alone, and walk abroad a mile;"
3087,III,"Yet if I walk alone, and think of naught at all,"
3088,III,Why from me that's young should the wild tears fall?
3089,III,
3090,III,"The shower-sodden earth, the earth-colored streams,"
3091,III,"They breathe on me awake, and moan to me in dreams,"
3092,III,"And yonder ivy fondling the broke castle-wall,"
3093,III,It pulls upon my heart till the wild tears fall.
3094,III,
3095,III,"The cabin-door looks down a furze-lighted hill,"
3096,III,And far as Leighlin Cross the fields are green and still;
3097,III,"But once I hear the blackbird in Leighlin hedges call,"
3098,III,"The foolishness is on me, and the wild tears fall!"

3108,III,"That at his lip did long to lie,"
3109,III,"But he hath drunk the red wine down,"
3110,III,And tossed the goblet by.
3111,III,
3112,III,My heart it was a floating bird
3113,III,"That through the world did wander free,"
3114,III,"But he hath locked it in a cage,"
3115,III,And lost the silver key.
3116,III,
3117,III,"My heart it was a white, white rose"
3118,III,"That bloomed upon a broken bough,"
3119,III,"He did but wear it for an hour,"
3120,III,And it is withered now.

3135,III,"And the wind from out the west,"
3136,III,"""Wound the heart within his breast,"""

3152,III,Good-bye!

3154,III,Good-bye!
3155,III,"Ah, well! shall I vow then to serve thee forever,"
3156,III,And swear no unkindness our kinship can sever?
3157,III,"Nay, nay, dear my lass! here's an end of endeavor."
3158,III,Good-bye!
3159,III,
3160,III,Yet let no sweet ruth for my misery grieve thee.
3161,III,Good-bye!
3162,III,The man who has loved knows as well how to leave thee.
3163,III,Good-bye!
3164,III,"The gorse is enkindled, there's bloom on the heather,"

3170,III,Good-bye!

3172,III,Good-bye!
3173,III,The red deer's a-tremble in coverts unbroken.
3174,III,He hears the hoof-thunder; he scents the death-token.
3175,III,"Shall I mope at home, under vows never spoken?"

3202,III,"Fields that are white, stained with long, cool, blue shadows,"

3223,III,"Mind free, step free,"
3224,III,"Days to follow after,"

3240,III,"His graver business set aside,"
3241,III,"Has stripling Will, the thoughtful-eyed,"
3242,III,"As to the pipe of Pan,"
3243,III,Stepped blithesomely with lover's pride
3244,III,Across the fields to Anne.
3245,III,
3246,III,"It must have been a merry mile,"
3247,III,"This summer stroll by hedge and stile,"
3248,III,With sweet foreknowledge all the while
3249,III,How sure the pathway ran
3250,III,"To dear delights of kiss and smile,"
3251,III,Across the fields to Anne.

3257,III,For many lads went wooing aye
3258,III,Across the fields to Anne.
3259,III,
3260,III,"The oaks, they have a wiser look;"
3261,III,Mayhap they whispered to the brook:
3262,III,"""The world by him shall yet be shook,"
3263,III,It is in nature's plan;
3264,III,Though now he fleets like any rook
3265,III,"Across the fields to Anne."""
3266,III,
3267,III,"And I am sure, that on some hour"
3268,III,"Coquetting soft 'twixt sun and shower,"
3269,III,He stooped and broke a daisy-flower
3270,III,"With heart of tiny span,"
3271,III,And bore it as a lover's dower
3272,III,Across the fields to Anne.
3273,III,
3274,III,While from her cottage garden-bed
3275,III,"She plucked a jasmine's goodlihede,"
3276,III,To scent his jerkin's brown instead;
3277,III,"Now since that love began,"
3278,III,What luckier swain than he who sped
3279,III,Across the fields to Anne?
3280,III,
3281,III,"The winding path whereon I pace,"
3282,III,"The hedgerow's green, the summer's grace,"
3283,III,Are still before me face to face;
3284,III,Methinks I almost can
3285,III,Turn poet and join the singing race
3286,III,Across the fields to Anne!

3298,III,But I must go away.
3299,III,
3300,III,"The little Road, like me,"
3301,III,Would seek and turn and know;
3302,III,"And forth I must, to learn the things"
3303,III,The little Road would show!
3304,III,
3305,III,"And go I must, my dears,"
3306,III,"And journey while I may,"
3307,III,Though heart be sore for the little House
3308,III,That had no word but Stay.
3309,III,
3310,III,"Maybe, no other way"

3319,III,
3320,III,
3321,III,
3322,III,Its friendship and its carelessness
3323,III,"Did lead me many a mile,"
3324,III,"Through goat's-rue, with its dim caress,"
3325,III,And pink and pearl-white smile;
3326,III,"Through crowfoot, with its golden lure,"
3327,III,"And promise of far things,"
3328,III,And sorrel with its glance demure
3329,III,And wide-eyed wonderings.
3330,III,
3331,III,"It led me with its innocence,"
3332,III,"As childhood leads the wise,"
3333,III,"With elbows here of tattered fence,"
3334,III,And blue of wildflower eyes;
3335,III,"With whispers low of leafy speech,"
3336,III,And brook-sweet utterance;
3337,III,"With bird-like words of oak and beech,"
3338,III,And whisperings clear as Pan's.
3339,III,
3340,III,"It led me with its childlike charm,"
3341,III,"As candor leads desire,"
3342,III,"Now with a clasp of blossomy arm,"
3343,III,A butterfly kiss of fire;
3344,III,"Now with a toss of tousled gold,"
3345,III,"A barefoot sound of green,"
3346,III,"A breath of musk, of mossy mold,"
3347,III,With vague allurements keen.
3348,III,
3349,III,It led me with remembered things
3350,III,"Into an old-time vale,"
3351,III,"Peopled with faery glimmerings,"
3352,III,And flower-like fancies pale;
3353,III,"Where fungous forms stood, gold and gray,"
3354,III,"Each in its mushroom gown,"
3355,III,"And, roofed with red, glimpsed far away,"
3356,III,A little toadstool town.
3357,III,
3358,III,"It led me with an idle ease,"
3359,III,"A vagabond look and air,"
3360,III,A sense of ragged arms and knees
3361,III,In weeds grown everywhere;
3362,III,"It led me, as a gypsy leads,"
3363,III,"To dingles no one knows,"
3364,III,"With beauty burred with thorny seeds,"
3365,III,And tangled wild with rose.
3366,III,
3367,III,It led me as simplicity
3368,III,"Leads age and its demands,"
3369,III,"With bee-beat of its ecstasy,"
3370,III,And berry-stained touch of hands;
3371,III,"With round revealments, puff-ball white,"
3372,III,"Through rents of weedy brown,"
3373,III,And petaled movements of delight
3374,III,In roseleaf limb and gown.
3375,III,
3376,III,"It led me on and on and on,"
3377,III,"Beyond the Far Away,"
3378,III,"Into a world long dead and gone, --"
3379,III,The world of Yesterday:
3380,III,"A faery world of memory,"
3381,III,"Old with its hills and streams,"
3382,III,Wherein the child I used to be
3383,III,Still wanders with his dreams.

3392,III,Across the fields of yesterday
3393,III,"He sometimes comes to me,"
3394,III,A little lad just back from play --
3395,III,The lad I used to be.
3396,III,
3397,III,And yet he smiles so wistfully
3398,III,"Once he has crept within,"
3399,III,I wonder if he hopes to see
3400,III,The man I might have been.

3406,III,
3407,III,
3408,III,
3409,III,All I could see from where I stood
3410,III,Was three long mountains and a wood;
3411,III,"I turned and looked another way,"
3412,III,And saw three islands in a bay.
3413,III,So with my eyes I traced the line
3414,III,"Of the horizon, thin and fine,"
3415,III,Straight around till I was come
3416,III,Back to where I'd started from;
3417,III,And all I saw from where I stood
3418,III,Was three long mountains and a wood.
3419,III,Over these things I could not see;
3420,III,These were the things that bounded me;
3421,III,"And I could touch them with my hand,"
3422,III,"Almost, I thought, from where I stand."
3423,III,And all at once things seemed so small
3424,III,"My breath came short, and scarce at all."
3425,III,"But, sure, the sky is big, I said;"
3426,III,Miles and miles above my head;
3427,III,So here upon my back I'll lie
3428,III,And look my fill into the sky.
3429,III,"And so I looked, and, after all,"
3430,III,The sky was not so very tall.
3431,III,"The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,"
3432,III,And -- sure enough! -- I see the top!
3433,III,"The sky, I thought, is not so grand;"
3434,III,I 'most could touch it with my hand!
3435,III,"And, reaching up my hand to try,"
3436,III,I screamed to feel it touch the sky.
3437,III,
3438,III,"I screamed, and -- lo! -- Infinity"
3439,III,Came down and settled over me;
3440,III,"And, pressing of the Undefined"
3441,III,"The definition on my mind,"
3442,III,Held up before my eyes a glass
3443,III,Through which my shrinking sight did pass
3444,III,Until it seemed I must behold
3445,III,Immensity made manifold;
3446,III,Whispered to me a word whose sound
3447,III,"Deafened the air for worlds around,"
3448,III,And brought unmuffled to my ears
3449,III,"The gossiping of friendly spheres,"
3450,III,"The creaking of the tented sky,"
3451,III,The ticking of Eternity.
3452,III,"I saw and heard, and knew at last"
3453,III,"The How and Why of all things, past,"
3454,III,"And present, and forevermore."
3455,III,"The universe, cleft to the core,"
3456,III,Lay open to my probing sense
3457,III,"That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence"
3458,III,"But could not, -- nay!  But needs must suck"
3459,III,"At the great wound, and could not pluck"
3460,III,My lips away till I had drawn
3461,III,"All venom out. --  Ah, fearful pawn!"
3462,III,For my omniscience paid I toll
3463,III,In infinite remorse of soul.
3464,III,"All sin was of my sinning, all"
3465,III,"Atoning mine, and mine the gall"
3466,III,Of all regret.  Mine was the weight
3467,III,"Of every brooded wrong, the hate"
3468,III,"That stood behind each envious thrust,"
3469,III,"Mine every greed, mine every lust."
3470,III,"And all the while for every grief,"
3471,III,"Each suffering, I craved relief"
3472,III,"With individual desire, --"
3473,III,Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire
3474,III,About a thousand people crawl;
3475,III,"Perished with each, -- then mourned for all!"
3476,III,A man was starving in Capri;
3477,III,He moved his eyes and looked at me;
3478,III,"I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,"
3479,III,And knew his hunger as my own.
3480,III,I saw at sea a great fog-bank
3481,III,Between two ships that struck and sank;
3482,III,A thousand screams the heavens smote;
3483,III,And every scream tore through my throat.
3484,III,"No hurt I did not feel, no death"
3485,III,That was not mine; mine each last breath
3486,III,"That, crying, met an answering cry"
3487,III,From the compassion that was I.
3488,III,"All suffering mine, and mine its rod;"
3489,III,"Mine, pity like the pity of God."
3490,III,"Ah, awful weight!  Infinity"
3491,III,Pressed down upon the finite Me!
3492,III,"My anguished spirit, like a bird,"
3493,III,Beating against my lips I heard;
3494,III,Yet lay the weight so close about
3495,III,There was no room for it without.
3496,III,And so beneath the Weight lay I
3497,III,"And suffered death, but could not die."
3498,III,
3499,III,"Long had I lain thus, craving death,"
3500,III,When quietly the earth beneath
3501,III,"Gave way, and inch by inch, so great"
3502,III,"At last had grown the crushing weight,"
3503,III,Into the earth I sank till I
3504,III,"Full six feet under ground did lie,"
3505,III,"And sank no more, -- there is no weight"
3506,III,"Can follow here, however great."
3507,III,"From off my breast I felt it roll,"
3508,III,And as it went my tortured soul
3509,III,Burst forth and fled in such a gust
3510,III,That all about me swirled the dust.
3511,III,
3512,III,Deep in the earth I rested now;
3513,III,Cool is its hand upon the brow
3514,III,And soft its breast beneath the head
3515,III,Of one who is so gladly dead.
3516,III,"And all at once, and over all,"
3517,III,The pitying rain began to fall;
3518,III,I lay and heard each pattering hoof
3519,III,"Upon my lowly, thatched roof,"
3520,III,And seemed to love the sound far more
3521,III,Than ever I had done before.
3522,III,For rain it hath a friendly sound
3523,III,To one who's six feet underground;
3524,III,And scarce the friendly voice or face:
3525,III,A grave is such a quiet place.
3526,III,
3527,III,"The rain, I said, is kind to come"
3528,III,And speak to me in my new home.
3529,III,I would I were alive again
3530,III,"To kiss the fingers of the rain,"
3531,III,To drink into my eyes the shine
3532,III,"Of every slanting silver line,"
3533,III,"To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze"
3534,III,From drenched and dripping apple-trees.
3535,III,"For soon the shower will be done,"
3536,III,And then the broad face of the sun
3537,III,Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth
3538,III,Until the world with answering mirth
3539,III,"Shakes joyously, and each round drop"
3540,III,"Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top."
3541,III,"How can I bear it; buried here,"
3542,III,While overhead the sky grows clear
3543,III,And blue again after the storm?
3544,III,"O, multi-colored, multiform,"
3545,III,"Beloved beauty over me,"
3546,III,"That I shall never, never see"
3547,III,"Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,"
3548,III,That I shall never more behold!
3549,III,"Sleeping your myriad magics through,"
3550,III,Close-sepulchred away from you!
3551,III,"O God, I cried, give me new birth,"
3552,III,And put me back upon the earth!
3553,III,Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd
3554,III,"And let the heavy rain, down-poured"
3555,III,"In one big torrent, set me free,"
3556,III,Washing my grave away from me!
3557,III,
3558,III,"I ceased; and, through the breathless hush"
3559,III,"That answered me, the far-off rush"
3560,III,Of herald wings came whispering
3561,III,Like music down the vibrant string
3562,III,"Of my ascending prayer, and -- crash!"
3563,III,Before the wild wind's whistling lash
3564,III,The startled storm-clouds reared on high
3565,III,"And plunged in terror down the sky,"
3566,III,And the big rain in one black wave
3567,III,Fell from the sky and struck my grave.
3568,III,
3569,III,I know not how such things can be
3570,III,I only know there came to me
3571,III,A fragrance such as never clings
3572,III,To aught save happy living things;
3573,III,A sound as of some joyous elf
3574,III,"Singing sweet songs to please himself,"
3575,III,"And, through and over everything,"
3576,III,A sense of glad awakening.
3577,III,"The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,"
3578,III,Whispering to me I could hear;
3579,III,I felt the rain's cool finger-tips
3580,III,"Brushed tenderly across my lips,"
3581,III,"Laid gently on my sealed sight,"
3582,III,And all at once the heavy night
3583,III,"Fell from my eyes and I could see, --"
3584,III,"A drenched and dripping apple-tree,"
3585,III,"A last long line of silver rain,"
3586,III,A sky grown clear and blue again.
3587,III,And as I looked a quickening gust
3588,III,Of wind blew up to me and thrust
3589,III,Into my face a miracle
3590,III,"Of orchard-breath, and with the smell, --"
3591,III,I know not how such things can be! --
3592,III,I breathed my soul back into me.
3593,III,Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I
3594,III,And hailed the earth with such a cry
3595,III,As is not heard save from a man
3596,III,"Who has been dead, and lives again."
3597,III,About the trees my arms I wound;
3598,III,Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;
3599,III,I raised my quivering arms on high;
3600,III,"I laughed and laughed into the sky,"
3601,III,Till at my throat a strangling sob
3602,III,"Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb"
3603,III,Sent instant tears into my eyes;
3604,III,"O God, I cried, no dark disguise"
3605,III,Can e'er hereafter hide from me
3606,III,Thy radiant identity!
3607,III,Thou canst not move across the grass
3608,III,"But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,"
3609,III,"Nor speak, however silently,"
3610,III,But my hushed voice will answer Thee.
3611,III,I know the path that tells Thy way
3612,III,Through the cool eve of every day;
3613,III,"God, I can push the grass apart"
3614,III,And lay my finger on Thy heart!
3615,III,
3616,III,The world stands out on either side
3617,III,No wider than the heart is wide;
3618,III,"Above the world is stretched the sky, --"
3619,III,No higher than the soul is high.
3620,III,The heart can push the sea and land
3621,III,Farther away on either hand;
3622,III,"The soul can split the sky in two,"
3623,III,And let the face of God shine through.
3624,III,But East and West will pinch the heart
3625,III,That cannot keep them pushed apart;
3626,III,And he whose soul is flat -- the sky
3627,III,Will cave in on him by and by.

3640,III,
3641,III,"And she is swallow-fleet, and free"
3642,III,From mortal bonds and bars.
3643,III,"She laughs, because Eternity"

3667,III,"Stood with raised wings, and listened for the tone"
3668,III,"Of God's command to reach his eager ears,"
3669,III,"While Chaos wavered, for she felt her years"
3670,III,Unsceptered now in that convulsive zone.
3671,III,Night trembled.  And as one hath oft beheld

3720,III,

3752,III,"As I came down from Lebanon,"
3753,III,"Came winding, wandering slowly down"

3755,III,The cloudless day was well-nigh done.
3756,III,"The city, like an opal set"
3757,III,"In emerald, showed each minaret"
3758,III,"Afire with radiant beams of sun,"
3759,III,"And glistened orange, fig, and lime,"
3760,III,"Where song-birds made melodious chime,"
3761,III,As I came down from Lebanon.
3762,III,
3763,III,"As I came down from Lebanon,"
3764,III,"Like lava in the dying glow,"
3765,III,Through olive orchards far below
3766,III,I saw the murmuring river run;
3767,III,And 'neath the wall upon the sand
3768,III,"Swart sheiks from distant Samarcand,"
3769,III,"With precious spices they had won,"

3805,I,"Memphis and Karnak, Luxor, Thebes, the Nile:"
3806,I,Of these your letters told; and I who read
3807,I,Saw loom on dim horizons Egypt's dead
3808,I,"In march across the desert, mile on mile,"
3809,I,A ghostly caravan in slow defile
3810,I,Between the sand and stars; and at their head
3811,I,From unmapped darkness into darkness fled
3812,I,The gods that Egypt feared a little while.
3813,I,
3814,I,There black against the night I saw them loom
3815,I,With captive kings and armies in array
3816,I,"Remembered only by their sculptured doom,"
3817,I,And thought:  What Egypt was are we to-day.
3818,I,Then rose obscure against the rearward gloom

3826,II,"A sovereign city free from greed and guile,"
3827,II,The half-embodied dream of Pericles.
3828,II,"Then saw I one of smooth words, swift to please,"
3829,II,At laggard virtue mock with shrug and smile;
3830,II,"With Cleon's creed rang court and peristyle,"
3831,II,Then sank the sun in far Sicilian seas.
3832,II,
3833,II,From brows ignoble fell the violet crown.
3834,II,Again the warning sounds; the hosts engage:
3835,II,"In Cleon's face we fling our battle gage,"
3836,II,We win as foes of Cleon loud renown;

3847,III,The rooted evil that within our gate
3848,III,"Will sprout again and flourish, branch and blade;"
3849,III,For only from within can ill be stayed
3850,III,While Adam's seed is unregenerate.
3851,III,
3852,III,With zeal redoubled let our strength be strained

3867,IV,"Another code evolving, think to gain"
3868,IV,Surcease of man's inheritance of pain
3869,IV,And mold a state immune from evil's sway.
3870,IV,
3871,IV,"Not laws; but virtue in the soul we need,"
3872,IV,"The old Socratic justice in the heart,"
3873,IV,The golden rule become the people's creed

3894,IV,"Where high the tombs of royal Egypt heave,"

4160,V,"We are they that go, that go,"
4161,V,Plunging before the hidden blow.
4162,V,"We run the byways of the earth,"
4163,V,"For we are fugitive from birth,"
4164,V,"Blindfolded, with wide hands abroad"
4165,V,"That sow, that sow the sullen sod."
4166,V,
4167,V,"We cannot wait, we cannot stop"
4168,V,For flushing field or quickened crop;
4169,V,The orange bow of dusky dawn
4170,V,Glimmers our smoking swath upon;
4171,V,Blindfolded still we hurry on.
4172,V,
4173,V,How we do know the ways we run
4174,V,That are blindfolded from the sun?
4175,V,"We stagger swiftly to the call,"
4176,V,Our wide hands feeling for the wall.
4177,V,
4178,V,"Oh, ye who climb to some clear heaven,"
4179,V,"By grace of day and leisure given,"
4180,V,"Pity us, fugitive and driven --"

4188,V,
4189,V,
4190,V,
4191,V,We are the toilers from whom God barred
4192,V,The gifts that are good to hold.
4193,V,"We meant full well and we tried full hard,"
4194,V,And our failures were manifold.
4195,V,
4196,V,And we are the clan of those whose kin
4197,V,Were a millstone dragging them down.
4198,V,"Yea, we had to sweat for our brother's sin,"
4199,V,And lose the victor's crown.
4200,V,
4201,V,"The seeming-able, who all but scored,"
4202,V,From their teeming tribe we come:
4203,V,"What was there wrong with us, O Lord,"
4204,V,That our lives were dark and dumb?
4205,V,
4206,V,"The men ten-talented, who still"
4207,V,"Strangely missed of the goal,"
4208,V,Of them we are:  it seems Thy will
4209,V,To harrow some in soul.
4210,V,
4211,V,"We are the sinners, too, whose lust"
4212,V,"Conquered the higher claims,"
4213,V,"We sat us prone in the common dust,"
4214,V,And played at the devil's games.
4215,V,
4216,V,"We are the hard-luck folk, who strove"
4217,V,"Zealously, but in vain;"
4218,V,"We lost and lost, while our comrades throve,"
4219,V,And still we lost again.
4220,V,
4221,V,We are the doubles of those whose way
4222,V,Was festal with fruits and flowers;
4223,V,"Body and brain we were sound as they,"
4224,V,But the prizes were not ours.
4225,V,
4226,V,"A mighty army our full ranks make,"
4227,V,We shake the graves as we go;
4228,V,"The sudden stroke and the slow heartbreak,"
4229,V,They both have brought us low.
4230,V,
4231,V,"And while we are laying life's sword aside,"
4232,V,"Spent and dishonored and sad,"
4233,V,"Our epitaph this, when once we have died:"
4234,V,"""The weak lie here, and the bad."""
4235,V,
4236,V,"We wonder if this can be really the close,"

4245,V,
4246,V,
4247,V,
4248,V,"They went forth to battle, but they always fell;"
4249,V,Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields;
4250,V,"Nobly they fought and bravely, but not well,"
4251,V,And sank heart-wounded by a subtle spell.
4252,V,"They knew not fear that to the foeman yields,"
4253,V,"They were not weak, as one who vainly wields"
4254,V,A futile weapon; yet the sad scrolls tell
4255,V,How on the hard-fought field they always fell.
4256,V,
4257,V,"It was a secret music that they heard,"
4258,V,A sad sweet plea for pity and for peace;
4259,V,"And that which pierced the heart was but a word,"
4260,V,Though the white breast was red-lipped where the sword
4261,V,"Pressed a fierce cruel kiss, to put surcease"
4262,V,"On its hot thirst, but drank a hot increase."
4263,V,"Ah, they by some strange troubling doubt were stirred,"
4264,V,And died for hearing what no foeman heard.
4265,V,
4266,V,They went forth to battle but they always fell;
4267,V,Their might was not the might of lifted spears;
4268,V,Over the battle-clamor came a spell
4269,V,"Of troubling music, and they fought not well."
4270,V,"Their wreaths are willows and their tribute, tears;"
4271,V,Their names are old sad stories in men's ears;
4272,V,"Yet they will scatter the red hordes of Hell,"
4273,V,Who went to battle forth and always fell.

4289,V,Now you were ended.  They praised you . . . and laid you away.
4290,V,"The others, that mourned you in silence and terror and truth,"

4294,V,"Where are those lovers of yours, on what name do they call,"

4297,V,"A hundred white eagles have risen, the sons of your sons."
4298,V,"The zeal in their wings is a zeal that your dreaming began,"
4299,V,The valor that wore out your soul in the service of man.
4300,V,Sleep softly . . . eagle forgotten . . . under the stone.

4302,V,"Sleep on, O brave-hearted, O wise man that kindled the flame --"

4324,V,
4325,V,Thou art so lithe and lovely

4349,V,
4350,V,"He seems to hearken, Glaucoe,"

4390,V,"Who made him dead to rapture and despair,"
4391,V,"A thing that grieves not and that never hopes,"
4392,V,"Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?"
4393,V,Who loosened and let down this brutal jaw?
4394,V,Whose was the hand that slanted back this brow?
4395,V,Whose breath blew out the light within this brain?
4396,V,Is this the Thing the Lord God made and gave
4397,V,To have dominion over sea and land;
4398,V,To trace the stars and search the heavens for power;
4399,V,To feel the passion of Eternity?
4400,V,Is this the Dream He dreamed who shaped the suns
4401,V,And marked their ways upon the ancient deep?
4402,V,Down all the stretch of Hell to its last gulf
4403,V,There is no shape more terrible than this --
4404,V,More tongued with censure of the world's blind greed --
4405,V,More filled with signs and portents for the soul --
4406,V,More fraught with menace to the universe.

4413,V,Through this dread shape the suffering ages look;
4414,V,Time's tragedy is in that aching stoop;
4415,V,"Through this dread shape humanity betrayed,"
4416,V,"Plundered, profaned and disinherited,"

4424,V,Touch it again with immortality;
4425,V,Give back the upward looking and the light;
4426,V,Rebuild in it the music and the dream;
4427,V,"Make right the immemorial infamies,"

4431,V,How will the Future reckon with this Man?
4432,V,How answer his brute question in that hour
4433,V,When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world?
4434,V,How will it be with kingdoms and with kings --

4496,V,"Ninety of God's long paces toward the North,"
4497,V,Will they behold the splendor of His face?
4498,V,To conquer the world must man renounce the world?
4499,V,These have renounced it.  Had ye only faith
4500,V,"Ye might move mountains, said the Nazarene."
4501,V,"Why, these have faith to move the zones of man"
4502,V,Out to the point where All and Nothing meet.
4503,V,"They catch the bit of Death between their teeth,"
4504,V,In one wild dash to trample the unknown
4505,V,And leap the gates of knowledge.  They have dared
4506,V,Even to defy the sentinel that guards
4507,V,The doors of the forbidden -- dared to hurl
4508,V,"Their breathing bodies after the Ideal,"
4509,V,That like the heavenly kingdom must be taken
4510,V,Only by violence.  The star that leads
4511,V,The leader of this quest has held the world
4512,V,True to its orbit for a million years.
4513,V,
4514,V,And shall he fail?  They never fail who light
4515,V,Their lamp of faith at the unwavering flame
4516,V,Burnt for the altar service of the Race
4517,V,Since the beginning.  He shall find the strange --
4518,V,"The white immaculate Virgin of the North,"
4519,V,"Whose steady gaze no mortal ever dared,"
4520,V,Whose icy hand no human ever grasped.
4521,V,In the dread silence and the solitude
4522,V,She waits and listens through the centuries
4523,V,"For one indomitable, destined soul,"
4524,V,"Born to endure the glory of her eyes,"
4525,V,And lift his warm lips to the frozen Grail.

4538,I,Imagines this triumphant strength may bear
4539,I,"His paltry sway! yea, ignorantly dreams,"
4540,I,"Because proud Rhea now his vassal seems,"
4541,I,"And Neptune him obeys in billowy lair,"
4542,I,"That he a more sublime assault may dare,"
4543,I,Where blown by tempest wild the vulture screams!
4544,I,
4545,I,"Presumptuous, he mounts:  I toss his bones"
4546,I,Back from the height supernal he has braved:
4547,I,"Ay, as his vessel nears my perilous zones,"
4548,I,I blow the cockle-shell away like chaff
4549,I,And give him to the Sea he has enslaved.
4550,I,He founders in its depths; and then I laugh!

4552,I,
4553,II,II
4554,II,
4555,II,"Impregnable I held myself, secure"

4557,II,How should I guess his mortal will outran
4558,II,Defeat so far that danger could allure
4559,II,"For its own sake? -- that he would all endure,"
4560,II,"All sacrifice, all suffer, rather than"
4561,II,Forego the daring dreams Olympian
4562,II,That prophesy to him of victory sure?
4563,II,
4564,II,"Ah, tameless courage! -- dominating power"
4565,II,"That, all attempting, in a deathless hour"
4566,II,"Made earth-born Titans godlike, in revolt! --"
4567,II,Fear is the fire that melts Icarian wings:

4575,II,
4576,II,
4577,II,
4578,II,Who drives the horses of the sun
4579,II,Shall lord it but a day;
4580,II,"Better the lowly deed were done,"
4581,II,And kept the humble way.
4582,II,
4583,II,"The rust will find the sword of fame,"
4584,II,The dust will hide the crown;
4585,II,"Ay, none shall nail so high his name"
4586,II,Time will not tear it down.
4587,II,
4588,II,The happiest heart that ever beat
4589,II,Was in some quiet breast
4590,II,"That found the common daylight sweet,"
4591,II,And left to Heaven the rest.

4597,II,
4598,II,
4599,II,
4600,II,To-day I saw the shop-girl go
4601,II,Down gay Broadway to meet her beau.
4602,II,
4603,II,"Conspicuous, splendid, conscious, sweet,"
4604,II,She spread abroad and took the street.
4605,II,
4606,II,"And all that niceness would forbid,"
4607,II,"Superb, she smiled upon and did."
4608,II,
4609,II,"Let other girls, whose happier days"
4610,II,"Preserve the perfume of their ways,"
4611,II,
4612,II,Go modestly.  The passing hour
4613,II,Adds splendor to their opening flower.
4614,II,
4615,II,But from this child too swift a doom
4616,II,"Must steal her prettiness and bloom,"
4617,II,
4618,II,Toil and weariness hide the grace
4619,II,That pleads a moment from her face.
4620,II,
4621,II,So blame her not if for a day
4622,II,She flaunts her glories while she may.
4623,II,
4624,II,"She half perceives, half understands,"
4625,II,Snatching her gifts with both her hands.
4626,II,
4627,II,The little strut beneath the skirt
4628,II,"That lags neglected in the dirt,"
4629,II,
4630,II,The indolent swagger down the street --
4631,II,Who can condemn such happy feet!
4632,II,
4633,II,Innocent! vulgar -- that's the truth!
4634,II,Yet with the darling wiles of youth!
4635,II,
4636,II,"The bright, self-conscious eyes that stare"
4637,II,"With such hauteur, beneath such hair!"
4638,II,~Perhaps the men will find me fair!~
4639,II,
4640,II,"Charming and charmed, flippant, arrayed,"
4641,II,"Fluttered and foolish, proud, displayed,"
4642,II,Infinite pathos of parade!
4643,II,
4644,II,The bangles and the narrowed waist --
4645,II,The tinsled boa -- forgive the taste!
4646,II,"Oh, the starved nights she gave for that,"
4647,II,And bartered bread to buy her hat!
4648,II,
4649,II,She flows before the reproachful sage
4650,II,And begs her woman's heritage.
4651,II,
4652,II,"Dear child, with the defiant eyes,"
4653,II,Insolent with the half surmise
4654,II,"We do not quite admire, I know"
4655,II,How foresight frowns on this vain show!
4656,II,
4657,II,"And judgment, wearily sad, may see"
4658,II,No grace in such frivolity.
4659,II,
4660,II,Yet which of us was ever bold
4661,II,"To worship Beauty, hungry and cold!"
4662,II,
4663,II,"Scorn famine down, proudly expressed"
4664,II,Apostle to what things are best.
4665,II,
4666,II,Let him who starves to buy the food
4667,II,"For his soul's comfort find her good,"
4668,II,
4669,II,Nor chide the frills and furbelows
4670,II,That are the prettiest things she knows.
4671,II,
4672,II,Poet and prophet in God's eyes
4673,II,Make no more perfect sacrifice.
4674,II,
4675,II,Who knows before what inner shrine
4676,II,She eats with them the bread and wine?
4677,II,
4678,II,Poor waif!  One of the sacred few
4679,II,That madly sought the best they knew!
4680,II,
4681,II,Dear -- let me lean my cheek to-night
4682,II,"Close, close to yours.  Ah, that is right."
4683,II,
4684,II,How warm and near!  At last I see
4685,II,One beauty shines for thee and me.
4686,II,
4687,II,So let us love and understand --
4688,II,Whose hearts are hidden in God's hand.
4689,II,
4690,II,And we will cherish your brief Spring
4691,II,And all its fragile flowering.
4692,II,
4693,II,"God loves all prettiness, and on this"
4694,II,Surely his angels lay their kiss.

4701,II,
4702,II,
4703,II,What shape so furtive steals along the dim
4704,II,"Bleak street, barren of throngs, this day of June;"
4705,II,"This day of rest, when all the roses swoon"
4706,II,In Attic vales where dryads wait for him?
4707,II,"What sylvan this, and what the stranger whim"
4708,II,That lured him here this golden afternoon;
4709,II,Ways where the dusk has fallen oversoon
4710,II,"In the deep canyon, torrentless and grim?"
4711,II,
4712,II,"Great Pan is far, O mad estray, and these"
4713,II,Bare walls that leap to heaven and hide the skies
4714,II,Are fanes men rear to other deities;
4715,II,"Far to the east the haunted woodland lies,"

4723,II,
4724,II,
4725,II,
4726,II,By seven vineyards on one hill
4727,II,We walked.  The native wine
4728,II,"In clusters grew beside us two,"
4729,II,"For your lips and for mine,"
4730,II,
4731,II,"When, ""Hark!"" you said, -- ""Was that a bell"
4732,II,"Or a bubbling spring we heard?"""
4733,II,But I was wise and closed my eyes
4734,II,And listened to a bird;
4735,II,
4736,II,For as summer leaves are bent and shake
4737,II,"With singers passing through,"
4738,II,So moves in me continually
4739,II,The winged breath of you.
4740,II,
4741,II,You tasted from a single vine
4742,II,And took from that your fill --
4743,II,"But I inclined to every kind,"
4744,II,All seven on one hill.

4750,II,
4751,II,
4752,II,
4753,II,"The islands called me far away,"
4754,II,The valleys called me home.
4755,II,The rivers with a silver voice
4756,II,Drew on my heart to come.
4757,II,
4758,II,The paths reached tendrils to my hair
4759,II,From every vine and tree.
4760,II,There was no refuge anywhere
4761,II,Until I came to thee.
4762,II,
4763,II,"There is a northern cloud I know,"
4764,II,Along a mountain crest;
4765,II,"And as she folds her wings of mist,"
4766,II,So I could make my rest.
4767,II,
4768,II,There is no chain to bind her so
4769,II,Unto that purple height;
4770,II,"And she will shine and wander, slow,"
4771,II,"Slow, with a cloud's delight."
4772,II,
4773,II,"Would she begone?  She melts away,"
4774,II,A heavenly joyous thing.
4775,II,"Yet day will find the mountain white,"
4776,II,White-folded with her wing.
4777,II,
4778,II,"As you may see, but half aware"
4779,II,"If it be late or soon,"
4780,II,"Soft breathing on the day-time air,"
4781,II,The fair forgotten Moon.
4782,II,
4783,II,"And though love cannot bind me, Love,"
4784,II,-- Ah no! -- yet I could stay

4795,II,"My love for thee doth take me unaware,"
4796,II,"When most with lesser things my brain is wrought,"
4797,II,As in some nimble interchange of thought
4798,II,"The silence enters, and the talkers stare."
4799,II,"Suddenly I am still and thou art there,"
4800,II,"A viewless visitant and unbesought,"
4801,II,And all my thinking trembles into nought
4802,II,And all my being opens like a prayer.
4803,II,"Thou art the lifted Chalice in my soul,"
4804,II,And I a dim church at the thought of thee;
4805,II,"Brief be the moment, but the mass is said,"
4806,II,The benediction like an aureole
4807,II,"Is on my spirit, and shuddering through me"
4808,II,A rapture like the rapture of the dead.

4820,II,Early to serve and late.
4821,II,
4822,II,If love were but a passing breath --

4836,II,"I count them over, every one apart,"
4837,II,My rosary.
4838,II,
4839,II,"Each hour a pearl, each pearl a prayer,"
4840,II,To still a heart in absence wrung;
4841,II,I tell each bead unto the end -- and there
4842,II,A cross is hung.
4843,II,
4844,II,"Oh, memories that bless -- and burn!"
4845,II,"Oh, barren gain -- and bitter loss!"
4846,II,"I kiss each bead, and strive at last to learn"

4857,II,
4858,II,That day her eyes were deep as night.
4859,II,"She had the motion of the rose,"
4860,II,"The bird that veers across the light,"
4861,II,The waterfall that leaps and throws
4862,II,Its irised spindrift to the sun.
4863,II,She seemed a wind of music passing on.
4864,II,
4865,II,Alone I saw her that one day
4866,II,Stand in the window of my life.
4867,II,Her sudden hand melted away
4868,II,"Under my lips, and without strife"
4869,II,I held her in my arms awhile
4870,II,"And drew into my lips her living smile, --"
4871,II,
4872,II,Now many a day ago and year!
4873,II,Since when I dream and lie awake
4874,II,"In summer nights to feel her near,"
4875,II,And from the heavy darkness break
4876,II,"Glitters, till all my spirit swims"
4877,II,And her hand hovers on my shaking limbs.
4878,II,
4879,II,If once again before I die
4880,II,I drank the laughter of her mouth
4881,II,"And quenched my fever utterly,"

4923,II,As any blossom of the spring.
4924,II,"But in thine eyes there is a thing,"
4925,II,"O Love, that makes me half afraid."
4926,II,
4927,II,"For they are old, those eyes . . .  They gleam"
4928,II,Between the waking and the dream
4929,II,"With antique wisdom, like a bright"
4930,II,"Lamp strangled by the temple's veil,"
4931,II,That beckons to the acolyte
4932,II,Who prays with trembling lips and pale
4933,II,In the long watches of the night.
4934,II,
4935,II,They are as old as Life.  They were
4936,II,When proud Gomorrah reared its head
4937,II,A new-born city.  They were there
4938,II,When in the places of the dead
4939,II,Men swathed the body of the Lord.
4940,II,They visioned Pa-wak raise the wall
4941,II,Of China.  They saw Carthage fall
4942,II,And marked the grim Hun lead his horde.
4943,II,
4944,II,There is no secret anywhere
4945,II,Nor any joy or shame that lies
4946,II,Not writ somehow in those child-eyes
4947,II,"Of thine, O Love, in some strange wise."
4948,II,"Thou art the lad Endymion,"
4949,II,And that great queen with spice and myrrh
4950,II,"From Araby, whom Solomon"

4952,II,
4953,II,The legions marching from the sea
4954,II,"With Caesar's cohorts sang of thee,"
4955,II,How thy fair head was more to him
4956,II,Than all the land of Italy.
4957,II,"Yea, in the old days thou wast she"
4958,II,Who lured Mark Antony from home
4959,II,"To death and Egypt, seeing he"
4960,II,Lost love when he lost Rome.
4961,II,
4962,II,"Thou saw'st old Tubal strike the lyre,"
4963,II,"Yea, first for thee the poet hurled"
4964,II,Defiance at God's starry choir!
4965,II,"Thou art the romance and the fire,"

4987,II,"Twin-born of knowledge and of lust,"
4988,II,"He was before us, he shall be"
4989,II,"Indifferent still of thee and me,"
4990,II,"When shattered is life's golden cup,"
4991,II,"When thy young limbs are shrivelled up,"
4992,II,And when my heart is turned to dust.
4993,II,
4994,II,"Nay, sweet, smile not to know at last"

5079,II,
5080,II,
5081,II,
5082,II,"From their folded mates they wander far,"
5083,II,Their ways seem harsh and wild;
5084,II,"They follow the beck of a baleful star,"
5085,II,Their paths are dream-beguiled.
5086,II,
5087,II,"Yet haply they sought but a wider range,"
5088,II,"Some loftier mountain-slope,"
5089,II,And little recked of the country strange
5090,II,Beyond the gates of hope.
5091,II,
5092,II,And haply a bell with a luring call
5093,II,Summoned their feet to tread
5094,II,"Midst the cruel rocks, where the deep pitfall"
5095,II,And the lurking snare are spread.
5096,II,
5097,II,"Maybe, in spite of their tameless days"
5098,II,"Of outcast liberty,"
5099,II,They're sick at heart for the homely ways
5100,II,Where their gathered brothers be.
5101,II,
5102,II,"And oft at night, when the plains fall dark"
5103,II,"And the hills loom large and dim,"
5104,II,"For the Shepherd's voice they mutely hark,"
5105,II,And their souls go out to him.
5106,II,
5107,II,"Meanwhile, ""Black sheep!  Black sheep!"" we cry,"
5108,II,Safe in the inner fold;
5109,II,"And maybe they hear, and wonder why,"
5110,II,"And marvel, out in the cold."

5116,II,
5117,II,
5118,II,
5119,II,Let me no more a mendicant
5120,II,Without the gate
5121,II,Of the world's kingly palace wait;
5122,II,"Morning is spent,"
5123,II,"The sentinels change and challenge in the tower,"
5124,II,Now slant the shadows eastward hour by hour.
5125,II,
5126,II,"Open the door, O Seneschal!  Within"
5127,II,"I see them sit,"
5128,II,"The feasters, daring destiny with wit,"
5129,II,Casting to win
5130,II,"Or lose their utmost, and men hurry by"
5131,II,At offices of confluent energy.
5132,II,
5133,II,Let me not here a mendicant
5134,II,Without the gate
5135,II,"Linger from dayspring till the night is late,"
5136,II,And there are sent
5137,II,"All homeless stars to loiter in the sky,"
5138,II,And beggared midnight winds to wander by.

5144,II,
5145,II,
5146,II,
5147,II,When the Norn Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour
5148,II,"Greatening and darkening as it hurried on,"
5149,II,She left the Heaven of Heroes and came down
5150,II,To make a man to meet the mortal need.
5151,II,She took the tried clay of the common road --
5152,II,"Clay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,"
5153,II,Dashed through it all a strain of prophecy;
5154,II,Tempered the heap with thrill of human tears;
5155,II,Then mixed a laughter with the serious stuff.
5156,II,Into the shape she breathed a flame to light
5157,II,"That tender, tragic, ever-changing face."
5158,II,"Here was a man to hold against the world,"
5159,II,A man to match the mountains and the sea.
5160,II,
5161,II,"The color of the ground was in him, the red earth;"
5162,II,The smack and tang of elemental things;
5163,II,The rectitude and patience of the cliff;
5164,II,The good-will of the rain that loves all leaves;
5165,II,The friendly welcome of the wayside well;
5166,II,The courage of the bird that dares the sea;
5167,II,The gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;
5168,II,The pity of the snow that hides all scars;
5169,II,The secrecy of streams that make their way
5170,II,Beneath the mountain to the rifted rock;
5171,II,The tolerance and equity of light
5172,II,That gives as freely to the shrinking flower
5173,II,As to the great oak flaring to the wind --
5174,II,To the grave's low hill as to the Matterhorn
5175,II,That shoulders out the sky.
5176,II,
5177,II,"Sprung from the West,"
5178,II,"The strength of virgin forests braced his mind,"
5179,II,The hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul.
5180,II,"Up from log cabin to the Capitol,"
5181,II,"One fire was on his spirit, one resolve --"
5182,II,"To send the keen ax to the root of wrong,"
5183,II,Clearing a free way for the feet of God.
5184,II,And evermore he burned to do his deed
5185,II,With the fine stroke and gesture of a king:
5186,II,"He built the rail-pile as he built the State,"
5187,II,"Pouring his splendid strength through every blow,"
5188,II,"The conscience of him testing every stroke,"
5189,II,To make his deed the measure of a man.
5190,II,
5191,II,So came the Captain with the mighty heart;
5192,II,"And when the judgment thunders split the house,"
5193,II,"Wrenching the rafters from their ancient rest,"
5194,II,"He held the ridgepole up, and spiked again"
5195,II,The rafters of the Home.  He held his place --
5196,II,Held the long purpose like a growing tree --
5197,II,Held on through blame and faltered not at praise.
5198,II,"And when he fell in whirlwind, he went down"
5199,II,"As when a lordly cedar, green with boughs,"
5200,II,"Goes down with a great shout upon the hills,"
5201,II,And leaves a lonesome place against the sky.

5207,II,
5208,II,(Lincoln)
5209,II,
5210,II,
5211,II,
5212,II,A flying word from here and there
5213,II,"Had sown the name at which we sneered,"
5214,II,"But soon the name was everywhere,"
5215,II,To be reviled and then revered:
5216,II,"A presence to be loved and feared,"
5217,II,"We cannot hide it, or deny"
5218,II,"That we, the gentlemen who jeered,"
5219,II,May be forgotten by and by.
5220,II,
5221,II,He came when days were perilous
5222,II,And hearts of men were sore beguiled;
5223,II,"And having made his note of us,"
5224,II,He pondered and was reconciled.
5225,II,Was ever master yet so mild
5226,II,"As he, and so untamable?"
5227,II,"We doubted, even when he smiled,"
5228,II,Not knowing what he knew so well.
5229,II,
5230,II,He knew that undeceiving fate
5231,II,Would shame us whom he served unsought;
5232,II,He knew that he must wince and wait --
5233,II,The jest of those for whom he fought;
5234,II,He knew devoutly what he thought
5235,II,Of us and of our ridicule;
5236,II,He knew that we must all be taught
5237,II,Like little children in a school.
5238,II,
5239,II,We gave a glamour to the task
5240,II,"That he encountered and saw through,"
5241,II,"But little of us did he ask,"
5242,II,And little did we ever do.
5243,II,And what appears if we review
5244,II,The season when we railed and chaffed?
5245,II,It is the face of one who knew
5246,II,That we were learning while we laughed.
5247,II,
5248,II,The face that in our vision feels
5249,II,"Again the venom that we flung,"
5250,II,Transfigured to the world reveals
5251,II,The vigilance to which we clung.
5252,II,"Shrewd, hallowed, harassed, and among"
5253,II,"The mysteries that are untold,"
5254,II,"The face we see was never young,"
5255,II,Nor could it ever have been old.
5256,II,
5257,II,"For he, to whom we have applied"
5258,II,"Our shopman's test of age and worth,"
5259,II,"Was elemental when he died,"
5260,II,As he was ancient at his birth:
5261,II,"The saddest among kings of earth,"
5262,II,"Bowed with a galling crown, this man"
5263,II,"Met rancor with a cryptic mirth,"
5264,II,Laconic -- and Olympian.
5265,II,
5266,II,"The love, the grandeur, and the fame"
5267,II,Are bounded by the world alone;
5268,II,"The calm, the smouldering, and the flame"
5269,II,Of awful patience were his own:
5270,II,With him they are forever flown
5271,II,"Past all our fond self-shadowings,"
5272,II,Wherewith we cumber the Unknown
5273,II,As with inept Icarian wings.
5274,II,
5275,II,For we were not as other men:
5276,II,'T was ours to soar and his to see.
5277,II,"But we are coming down again,"
5278,II,And we shall come down pleasantly;
5279,II,Nor shall we longer disagree
5280,II,"On what it is to be sublime,"
5281,II,But flourish in our perigee
5282,II,And have one Titan at a time.

5288,II,
5289,II,
5290,II,
5291,II,Let not our town be large -- remembering
5292,II,That little Athens was the Muses' home;
5293,II,"That Oxford rules the heart of London still,"
5294,II,That Florence gave the Renaissance to Rome.
5295,II,
5296,II,Record it for the grandson of your son --
5297,II,A city is not builded in a day:
5298,II,Our little town cannot complete her soul
5299,II,Till countless generations pass away.
5300,II,
5301,II,Now let each child be joined as to a church
5302,II,"To her perpetual hopes, each man ordained;"
5303,II,Let every street be made a reverent aisle
5304,II,"Where music grows, and beauty is unchained."
5305,II,
5306,II,Let Science and Machinery and Trade
5307,II,"Be slaves of her, and make her all in all --"
5308,II,Building against our blatant restless time
5309,II,"An unseen, skillful, mediaeval wall."
5310,II,
5311,II,Let every citizen be rich toward God.
5312,II,"Let Christ, the beggar, teach divinity --"
5313,II,Let no man rule who holds his money dear.
5314,II,"Let this, our city, be our luxury."
5315,II,
5316,II,We should build parks that students from afar
5317,II,"Would choose to starve in, rather than go home --"
5318,II,"Fair little squares, with Phidian ornament --"
5319,II,"Food for the spirit, milk and honeycomb."
5320,II,
5321,II,Songs shall be sung by us in that good day --
5322,II,Songs we have written -- blood within the rhyme
5323,II,"Beating, as when old England still was glad,"
5324,II,"The purple, rich, Elizabethan time."
5325,II,
5326,II,"Say, is my prophecy too fair and far?"
5327,II,"I only know, unless her faith be high,"
5328,II,"The soul of this our Nineveh is doomed,"
5329,II,Our little Babylon will surely die.
5330,II,
5331,II,Some city on the breast of Illinois
5332,II,"No wiser and no better at the start,"
5333,II,By faith shall rise redeemed -- by faith shall rise
5334,II,Bearing the western glory in her heart --
5335,II,
5336,II,"The genius of the Maple, Elm and Oak,"
5337,II,The secret hidden in each grain of corn --
5338,II,The glory that the prairie angels sing
5339,II,At night when sons of Life and Love are born --
5340,II,
5341,II,"Born but to struggle, squalid and alone,"
5342,II,Broken and wandering in their early years.
5343,II,"When will they make our dusty streets their goal,"
5344,II,Within our attics hide their sacred tears?
5345,II,
5346,II,When will they start our vulgar blood athrill
5347,II,With living language -- words that set us free?
5348,II,When will they make a path of beauty clear
5349,II,Between our riches and our liberty?
5350,II,
5351,II,We must have many Lincoln-hearted men --
5352,II,A city is not builded in a day --
5353,II,"And they must do their work, and come and go"
5354,II,While countless generations pass away.

5388,II,"Serfs to a sordid duty,"

5393,II,"The weird, untempled Makers"
5394,II,Pulsed in the things he saw;

5396,II,Billowed the Song of Law.
5397,II,
5398,II,The epic roll of the furrow
5399,II,"Flung from the writing plow,"

5420,III,

5426,III,"Stabbed with the olden Sorrow,"

5484,VI,
5485,VI,"Never an oak tree borrowed,"

5508,VII,"Violets, scattering glories,"
5509,VII,Feed from the dewy gem:
5510,VII,But dreamers are fed by the living and dead --
5511,VII,And what is the gift from them?
5512,VII,
5513,VII,
5514,VIII,VIII
5515,VIII,
5516,VIII,Never a stalk of the Summer
5517,VIII,Dreams of its mission and doom:
5518,VIII,Only to hasten the Comer --
5519,VIII,Martyrdom unto the Bloom.
5520,VIII,
5521,VIII,Ever the Mighty Chooser
5522,VIII,"Plucks when the fruit is ripe,"
5523,VIII,"Scorning the mass and letting it pass,"

5525,VIII,
5526,VIII,Greece in her growing season
5527,VIII,"Troubled the lands and seas,"
5528,VIII,Plotted and fought and suffered and wrought --
5529,VIII,Building a Sophocles!
5530,VIII,
5531,VIII,Only a faultless temple
5532,VIII,Stands for the vassal's groan;
5533,VIII,The harlot's strife and the faith of the wife
5534,VIII,Blend in a graven stone.
5535,VIII,
5536,VIII,Ne'er do the stern gods cherish
5537,VIII,The hope of the million lives;
5538,VIII,Always the Fact shall perish
5539,VIII,And only the Truth survives.
5540,VIII,
5541,VIII,"Gardens of roses wither,"
5542,VIII,Shaping the perfect rose:

5551,IX,Hiding the ache of the tragic
5552,IX,Under the grin of the clown.
5553,IX,
5554,IX,Worn with the vain endeavor
5555,IX,To fit in the sordid plan;
5556,IX,"Doomed to be poet forever,"
5557,IX,He longed to be only a man;
5558,IX,
5559,IX,"To be freed from the god's enthralling,"
5560,IX,Back with the reeds of the stream;
5561,IX,"Deaf to the Vision calling,"
5562,IX,And dead to the lash of the Dream.
5563,IX,
5564,IX,

5567,X,But still did the Mighty Makers
5568,X,Stir in the common sod;

5570,X,Trembled and thrilled with God!
5571,X,
5572,X,"More than a man was the sower,"
5573,X,"Lured by a man's desire,"
5574,X,For a triune Bride walked close at his side --
5575,X,Dew and Dust and Fire!
5576,X,
5577,X,"More than a man was the plowman,"
5578,X,Shouting his gee and haw;
5579,X,"For a something dim kept pace with him,"
5580,X,And ever the poet saw;
5581,X,
5582,X,Till the winds of the cosmic struggle
5583,X,"Made of his flesh a flute,"
5584,X,To echo the tune of a whirlwind rune

5593,XI,And a clinging Dream for a wife;
5594,XI,
5595,XI,Ever the soul of the dreamer
5596,XI,"Strove with its mortal mesh,"
5597,XI,And the lean flame grew till it fretted through
5598,XI,The last thin links of flesh.
5599,XI,
5600,XI,"Oh, rending the veil asunder,"
5601,XI,He fled to mingle again

5611,XII,Aeschylus wanders back.
5612,XII,
5613,XII,"Ever inweaving, returning,"
5614,XII,The near grows out of the far;
5615,XII,And Homer shall sing once more in a swing
5616,XII,Of the austere Polar Star.
5617,XII,
5618,XII,Then what of the lonesome dreamer
5619,XII,With the lean blue flame in his breast?

5631,XIII,And yet -- a wakeful glory

5640,XIII,
5641,XIII,
5642,XIII,
5643,XIII,"Perhaps they laughed at Dante in his youth,"
5644,XIII,Told him that truth
5645,XIII,Had unappealably been said
5646,XIII,In the great masterpieces of the dead: --
5647,XIII,Perhaps he listened and but bowed his head
5648,XIII,"In acquiescent honour, while his heart"
5649,XIII,"Held natal tidings, -- that a new life is the part"
5650,XIII,"Of every man that's born,"
5651,XIII,"A new life never lived before,"
5652,XIII,And a new expectant art;
5653,XIII,It is the variations of the morn
5654,XIII,"That are forever, more and more,"
5655,XIII,The single dawning of the single truth.
5656,XIII,So answers Dante to the heart of youth!

5662,XIII,
5663,XIII,
5664,XIII,
5665,XIII,"When I am tired of earnest men,"
5666,XIII,"Intense and keen and sharp and clever,"
5667,XIII,Pursuing fame with brush or pen
5668,XIII,"Or counting metal disks forever,"
5669,XIII,Then from the halls of shadowland
5670,XIII,Beyond the trackless purple sea
5671,XIII,Old Martin's ghost comes back to stand
5672,XIII,Beside my desk and talk to me.
5673,XIII,
5674,XIII,Still on his delicate pale face
5675,XIII,"A quizzical thin smile is showing,"
5676,XIII,"His cheeks are wrinkled like fine lace,"
5677,XIII,His kind blue eyes are gay and glowing.
5678,XIII,"He wears a brilliant-hued cravat,"
5679,XIII,"A suit to match his soft gray hair,"
5680,XIII,"A rakish stick, a knowing hat,"
5681,XIII,A manner blithe and debonair.
5682,XIII,
5683,XIII,"How good, that he who always knew"
5684,XIII,"That being lovely was a duty,"
5685,XIII,Should have gold halls to wander through
5686,XIII,And should himself inhabit beauty.
5687,XIII,How like his old unselfish way
5688,XIII,To leave those halls of splendid mirth
5689,XIII,And comfort those condemned to stay
5690,XIII,Upon the bleak and sombre earth.
5691,XIII,
5692,XIII,Some people ask:  What cruel chance
5693,XIII,Made Martin's life so sad a story?
5694,XIII,"Martin?  Why, he exhaled romance"
5695,XIII,And wore an overcoat of glory.
5696,XIII,"A fleck of sunlight in the street,"
5697,XIII,"A horse, a book, a girl who smiled, --"
5698,XIII,Such visions made each moment sweet
5699,XIII,"For this receptive, ancient child."
5700,XIII,
5701,XIII,Because it was old Martin's lot
5702,XIII,"To be, not make, a decoration,"
5703,XIII,"Shall we then scorn him, having not"
5704,XIII,His genius of appreciation?
5705,XIII,Rich joy and love he got and gave;
5706,XIII,His heart was merry as his dress.
5707,XIII,Pile laurel wreaths upon his grave
5708,XIII,"Who did not gain, but was, success."

5714,XIII,
5715,XIII,
5716,XIII,
5717,XIII,As in the midst of battle there is room
5718,XIII,"For thoughts of love, and in foul sin for mirth;"
5719,XIII,As gossips whisper of a trinket's worth
5720,XIII,Spied by the death-bed's flickering candle-gloom;
5721,XIII,As in the crevices of Caesar's tomb
5722,XIII,The sweet herbs flourish on a little earth:
5723,XIII,So in this great disaster of our birth
5724,XIII,"We can be happy, and forget our doom."
5725,XIII,
5726,XIII,"For morning, with a ray of tenderest joy"
5727,XIII,"Gilding the iron heaven, hides the truth,"
5728,XIII,And evening gently woos us to employ
5729,XIII,Our grief in idle catches.  Such is youth;
5730,XIII,"Till from that summer's trance we wake, to find"
5731,XIII,"Despair before us, vanity behind."

5741,XIII,"Fast fading words adown my shadowy page,"
5742,XIII,"I crossed a tale of how, in other age,"
5743,XIII,"At Arqua, with his books around him, sped"
5744,XIII,The word to Petrarch; and with noble head
5745,XIII,Bowed gently o'er his volume that sweet sage
5746,XIII,To Silence paid his willing seigniorage.
5747,XIII,"And they who found him whispered, ""He is dead!"""
5748,XIII,
5749,XIII,Thus timely from old comradeships would I
5750,XIII,"To Silence also rise.  Let there be night,"
5751,XIII,"Stillness, and only these staid watchers by,"
5752,XIII,And no light shine save my low study light --
5753,XIII,Lest of his kind intent some human cry
5754,XIII,Interpret not the Messenger aright.

5763,XIII,Himself is least afraid
5764,XIII,When the singing lips in the dust
5765,XIII,With all mute lips are laid.
5766,XIII,For thither all men must.
5767,XIII,Nor is the end long stayed.
5768,XIII,
5769,XIII,"But he, having cast his song"
5770,XIII,Upon the faithful air
5771,XIII,And given it speed -- is strong
5772,XIII,"That last strange hour to dare,"
5773,XIII,Nor wills to tarry long.
5774,XIII,
5775,XIII,Adown immortal time
5776,XIII,"That greater self shall pass,"
5777,XIII,And wear its eager prime
5778,XIII,And lend the youth it has
5779,XIII,Like one far blowing chime.
5780,XIII,
5781,XIII,He has made sure the quest
5782,XIII,And now -- his word gone forth --
5783,XIII,May have his perfect rest

5785,XIII,The wind across his breast.

5793,XIII,
5794,XIII,"When I have finished with this episode,"
5795,XIII,"Left the hard, uphill road,"
5796,XIII,"And gone weird ways to seek another load,"
5797,XIII,"Oh, friends, regret me not, nor weep for me,"
5798,XIII,Child of Infinity!
5799,XIII,
5800,XIII,"Nor dig a grave, nor rear for me a tomb"
5801,XIII,"To say with lying writ:  ""Here in the gloom"

5803,XIII,"Content to pillow here his weary head,"
5804,XIII,"For he is dead."""
5805,XIII,
5806,XIII,"But give my body to the funeral pyre,"
5807,XIII,"And bid the laughing fire,"
5808,XIII,"Eager and strong and swift, like my desire,"
5809,XIII,"Scatter my subtle essence into space,"
5810,XIII,Free me of time and place.
5811,XIII,
5812,XIII,"And sweep the bitter ashes from the hearth,"
5813,XIII,Fling back the dust I borrowed from the earth
5814,XIII,"Into the chemic broil of death and birth,"
5815,XIII,"The vast alembic of the cryptic scheme,"
5816,XIII,Warm with the master-dream.
5817,XIII,
5818,XIII,"And thus, O little house that sheltered me,"
5819,XIII,"Dissolve again in wind and rain, to be"

5832,I,
5833,I,"In silence, solitude and stern surmise"
5834,I,His faith was tried and proved commensurate
5835,I,With life and death.  The stone-blind eyes of Fate
5836,I,"Perpetually stared into his eyes,"
5837,I,Yet to the hazard of the enterprise
5838,I,"He brought his soul, expectant and elate,"
5839,I,"And challenged, like a champion at the Gate,"
5840,I,Death's undissuadable austerities.
5841,I,"And thus, full-armed in all that Truth reprieves"
5842,I,"From dissolution, he beheld the breath"

5844,I,"While, like Dodona's sad, prophetic leaves,"
5845,I,"Round him the scant, supreme, momentous days"

5856,II,"Scatheless of Time and Time's vicissitude,"
5857,II,"Whose lips, perforce of endless solitude,"
5858,II,Were silent and whose eyes were blind and wide.
5859,II,But when he died came One who wore a wreath
5860,II,"Of star-light, and with fingers calm and bland"
5861,II,Smoothed from his brows the trace of mortal pain;
5862,II,"And of the two who stood on either hand,"

5895,II,"Who taught me bare-back, stirrup and reins?"
5896,II,"I loved him; he loved me; my beautiful, tender"

5898,II,
5899,II,"Where is he now whose eyes swam brighter,"
5900,II,"Softer than love, in his turbulent charms;"
5901,II,"Who taught me to strike, and to fall, dear fighter,"
5902,II,And gathered me up in his boyhood arms;
5903,II,"Taught me the rifle, and with me went riding,"
5904,II,Suppled my limbs to the horseman's war;

5918,II,There is no one now who presses my side;
5919,II,"By the African chotts I am riding asunder,"

5922,II,Thousands of miles there is no one near;

5930,II,"And the highest on earth was the vow that we cherished,"
5931,II,"To spur forth from the crowd and come back never more,"
5932,II,And to ride in the track of great souls perished
5933,II,Till the nests of the lark shall roof us o'er.

5935,II,"Yet lingers a horseman on Altai highlands,"
5936,II,"Who hath joy of me, riding the Tartar glissade;"

5938,II,Whose blood yet glints with my blade's accolade;
5939,II,"North, west, east, I fling you my last hallooing,"
5940,II,Last love to the breasts where my own has bled;

6037,I,"Uriel, you that in the ageless sun"
6038,I,"Sit in the awful silences of light,"
6039,I,"Singing of vision hid from human sight, --"
6040,I,"Prometheus, beautiful rebellious one!"
6041,I,"And you, Deucalion,"
6042,I,"For whose blind seed was brought the illuming spark,"
6043,I,"Are you not gathered, now his day is done,"
6044,I,Beside the brink of that relentless dark --

6053,II,Goes down in dark where you in dawn ascend.
6054,II,Our songs can but suspend
6055,II,The ultimate silence:  yet could song aspire
6056,II,The realms of mortal music to extend
6057,II,And wake a Sibyl's voice or Seraph's lyre --
6058,II,How should it tell the dearness of a friend?
6059,II,
6060,II,
6061,III,III
6062,III,
6063,III,The simplest is the inexpressible;
6064,III,"The heart of music still evades the Muse,"
6065,III,"And arts of men the heart of man suffuse,"
6066,III,And saddest things are made of silence still.
6067,III,In vain the senses thrill
6068,III,To give our sorrows glorious relief
6069,III,"In pyre of verse and pageants volatile,"
6070,III,"And I, in vain, to speak for him my grief"
6071,III,Whose spirit of fire invokes my waiting will.

6076,IV,To him the best of friendship needs must be
6077,IV,Uttered no more; yet was he so endowed
6078,IV,That Poetry because of him is proud
6079,IV,"And he more noble for his poetry,"
6080,IV,Wherefore infallibly
6081,IV,I obey the strong compulsion which this verse
6082,IV,Lays on my lips with strange austerity --
6083,IV,Now that his voice is silent -- to rehearse
6084,IV,For my own heart how he was dear to me.

6107,VI,"Of life-blood, stood Saint Paul, blazing a theme"
6108,VI,Of living drama from a fiery scroll

6118,VII,Gives afterglow; and now that comes again
6119,VII,The mellow season when
6120,VII,"Our eyes last met, his kindling currents run"
6121,VII,Quickening within me gladness and new ken
6122,VII,"Of life, that I have shared his prime with one"

6494,N. M. F.,
6495,N. M. F.,"She's somewhere in the sunlight strong,"
6496,N. M. F.,"Her tears are in the falling rain,"
6497,N. M. F.,"She calls me in the wind's soft song,"
6498,N. M. F.,And with the flowers she comes again.
6499,N. M. F.,
6500,N. M. F.,"Yon bird is but her messenger,"
6501,N. M. F.,The moon is but her silver car;
6502,N. M. F.,"Yea!  Sun and moon are sent by her,"
6503,N. M. F.,"And every wistful, waiting star."

6509,N. M. F.,
6510,N. M. F.,
6511,N. M. F.,
6512,N. M. F.,The low-voiced girls that go
6513,N. M. F.,"In gardens of the Lord,"
6514,N. M. F.,Like flowers of the field they grow
6515,N. M. F.,In sisterly accord.
6516,N. M. F.,
6517,N. M. F.,Their whispering feet are white
6518,N. M. F.,Along the leafy ways;
6519,N. M. F.,They go in whirls of light
6520,N. M. F.,Too beautiful for praise.
6521,N. M. F.,
6522,N. M. F.,And in their band forsooth
6523,N. M. F.,Is one to set me free --
6524,N. M. F.,The one that touched my youth --
6525,N. M. F.,The one God gave to me.
6526,N. M. F.,
6527,N. M. F.,She kindles the desire
6528,N. M. F.,Whereby the gods survive --
6529,N. M. F.,The white ideal fire
6530,N. M. F.,That keeps my soul alive.
6531,N. M. F.,
6532,N. M. F.,"Now at the wondrous hour,"
6533,N. M. F.,"She leaves her star supreme,"
6534,N. M. F.,"And comes in the night's still power,"
6535,N. M. F.,To touch me with a dream.
6536,N. M. F.,
6537,N. M. F.,Sibyl of mystery
6538,N. M. F.,"On roads unknown to men,"
6539,N. M. F.,"Softly she comes to me,"
6540,N. M. F.,And goes to God again.

6546,N. M. F.,
6547,N. M. F.,
6548,N. M. F.,
6549,N. M. F.,"Threading a darksome passage all alone,"
6550,N. M. F.,"The taper's flame, by envious current blown,"
6551,N. M. F.,"Crouched low, and eddied round, as in affright,"
6552,N. M. F.,"So challenged by the vast and hostile night,"
6553,N. M. F.,Then down I held the taper; -- swift and fain
6554,N. M. F.,Up climbed the lovely flower of light again!
6555,N. M. F.,
6556,N. M. F.,"Thou Kindler of the spark of life divine,"
6557,N. M. F.,Be henceforth the Inverted Torch a sign
6558,N. M. F.,"That, though the flame beloved thou dost depress,"
6559,N. M. F.,Thou wilt not speed it into nothingness;
6560,N. M. F.,"But out of nether gloom wilt reinspire,"
6561,N. M. F.,And homeward lift the keen empyreal fire!

6567,N. M. F.,
6568,N. M. F.,
6569,N. M. F.,
6570,N. M. F.,Night is the true democracy.  When day
6571,N. M. F.,"Like some great monarch with his train has passed,"
6572,N. M. F.,"In regal pomp and splendor to the last,"
6573,N. M. F.,"The stars troop forth along the Milky Way,"
6574,N. M. F.,"A jostling crowd, in radiant disarray,"
6575,N. M. F.,"On heaven's broad boulevard in pageants vast,"
6576,N. M. F.,"And things of earth, the hunted and outcast,"
6577,N. M. F.,"Come from their haunts and hiding-places; yea,"
6578,N. M. F.,Even from the nooks and crannies of the mind
6579,N. M. F.,"Visions uncouth and vagrant fancies start,"
6580,N. M. F.,"And specters of dead joy, that shun the light,"
6581,N. M. F.,"And impotent regrets and terrors blind,"
6582,N. M. F.,"Each one, in form grotesque, playing its part"
6583,N. M. F.,In the fantastic Mardi Gras of Night.

6589,N. M. F.,
6590,N. M. F.,
6591,N. M. F.,
6592,N. M. F.,"There is a quest that calls me,"
6593,N. M. F.,"In nights when I am lone,"
6594,N. M. F.,The need to ride where the ways divide
6595,N. M. F.,The Known from the Unknown.
6596,N. M. F.,I mount what thought is near me
6597,N. M. F.,"And soon I reach the place,"
6598,N. M. F.,The tenuous rim where the Seen grows dim
6599,N. M. F.,And the Sightless hides its face.
6600,N. M. F.,
6601,N. M. F.,"~I have ridden the wind,"
6602,N. M. F.,"I have ridden the sea,"
6603,N. M. F.,I have ridden the moon and stars.
6604,N. M. F.,I have set my feet in the stirrup seat
6605,N. M. F.,Of a comet coursing Mars.
6606,N. M. F.,And everywhere
6607,N. M. F.,Thro' the earth and air
6608,N. M. F.,"My thought speeds, lightning-shod,"
6609,N. M. F.,It comes to a place where checking pace
6610,N. M. F.,"It cries, ""Beyond lies God!""~"
6611,N. M. F.,
6612,N. M. F.,"It calls me out of the darkness,"
6613,N. M. F.,"It calls me out of sleep,"
6614,N. M. F.,"""Ride! ride! for you must, to the end of Dust!"""
6615,N. M. F.,It bids -- and on I sweep
6616,N. M. F.,"To the wide outposts of Being,"
6617,N. M. F.,Where there is Gulf alone --
6618,N. M. F.,And thro' a Vast that was never passed
6619,N. M. F.,I listen for Life's tone.
6620,N. M. F.,
6621,N. M. F.,"~I have ridden the wind,"
6622,N. M. F.,"I have ridden the night,"
6623,N. M. F.,I have ridden the ghosts that flee
6624,N. M. F.,From the vaults of death like a chilling breath
6625,N. M. F.,Over eternity.
6626,N. M. F.,And everywhere
6627,N. M. F.,Is the world laid bare --
6628,N. M. F.,Ether and star and clod --
6629,N. M. F.,Until I wind to its brink and find
6630,N. M. F.,"But the cry, ""Beyond lies God!""~"
6631,N. M. F.,
6632,N. M. F.,It calls me and ever calls me!
6633,N. M. F.,"And vainly I reply,"
6634,N. M. F.,"""Fools only ride where the ways divide"
6635,N. M. F.,"What Is from the Whence and Why""!"
6636,N. M. F.,I'm lifted into the saddle
6637,N. M. F.,Of thoughts too strong to tame
6638,N. M. F.,And down the deeps and over the steeps
6639,N. M. F.,I find -- ever the same.
6640,N. M. F.,
6641,N. M. F.,"~I have ridden the wind,"
6642,N. M. F.,"I have ridden the stars,"
6643,N. M. F.,I have ridden the force that flies
6644,N. M. F.,With far intent thro' the firmament
6645,N. M. F.,And each to each allies.
6646,N. M. F.,And everywhere
6647,N. M. F.,That a thought may dare
6648,N. M. F.,"To gallop, mine has trod --"
6649,N. M. F.,Only to stand at last on the strand
6650,N. M. F.,Where just beyond lies God.~

6658,N. M. F.,
6659,N. M. F.,"I would I might forget that I am I,"
6660,N. M. F.,"And break the heavy chain that binds me fast,"
6661,N. M. F.,Whose links about myself my deeds have cast.
6662,N. M. F.,What in the body's tomb doth buried lie
6663,N. M. F.,"Is boundless; 't is the spirit of the sky,"
6664,N. M. F.,"Lord of the future, guardian of the past,"
6665,N. M. F.,"And soon must forth, to know his own at last."
6666,N. M. F.,"In his large life to live, I fain would die."
6667,N. M. F.,
6668,N. M. F.,"Happy the dumb beast, hungering for food,"
6669,N. M. F.,But calling not his suffering his own;
6670,N. M. F.,"Blessed the angel, gazing on all good,"
6671,N. M. F.,But knowing not he sits upon a throne;
6672,N. M. F.,"Wretched the mortal, pondering his mood,"
6673,N. M. F.,And doomed to know his aching heart alone.

6688,N. M. F.,
6689,N. M. F.,"Spring wraps its transient scarf of green,"
6690,N. M. F.,"Its heathery robe, round slope and scar;"

6692,N. M. F.,Lights its lone star.
6693,N. M. F.,
6694,N. M. F.,"But you who loved these outland isles,"
6695,N. M. F.,"Their gleams, their glooms, their mysteries,"
6696,N. M. F.,"Their eldritch lures, their druid wiles,"
6697,N. M. F.,"Their tragic seas,"
6698,N. M. F.,
6699,N. M. F.,"Will heed no more, in mortal guise,"

6704,N. M. F.,"Yet, though where suns Sicilian beam"
6705,N. M. F.,"The loving earth enfolds your form,"

6707,N. M. F.,And hovering storm
6708,N. M. F.,
6709,N. M. F.,Still thrall your spirit -- that it bides
6710,N. M. F.,"By far Iona's kelp-strewn shore,"

6718,N. M. F.,
6719,N. M. F.,(Ave! Francis Thompson)
6720,N. M. F.,
6721,N. M. F.,
6722,N. M. F.,
6723,N. M. F.,He had been singing -- but I had not heard his voice;
6724,N. M. F.,"He had been weaving lovely dreams of song,"
6725,N. M. F.,O many a morning long.
6726,N. M. F.,"But I, remote and far,"
6727,N. M. F.,"Under an alien star,"
6728,N. M. F.,"Listened to other singers, other birds,"
6729,N. M. F.,And other silver words.
6730,N. M. F.,"But does the skylark, singing sweet and clear,"
6731,N. M. F.,Beg the cold world to hear?
6732,N. M. F.,"Rather he sings for very rapture of singing,"
6733,N. M. F.,"At dawn, or in the blue, mild Summer noon,"
6734,N. M. F.,"Knowing that, late or soon,"
6735,N. M. F.,"His wealth of beauty, and his high notes, ringing"
6736,N. M. F.,"Above the earth, will make some heart rejoice."
6737,N. M. F.,"He sings, albeit alone,"
6738,N. M. F.,"Spendthrift of each pure tone,"
6739,N. M. F.,"Hoarding no single song,"
6740,N. M. F.,No cadence wild and strong.
6741,N. M. F.,"But one day, from a friend far overseas,"
6742,N. M. F.,"As if upon the breeze,"
6743,N. M. F.,There came the teeming wonder of his words --
6744,N. M. F.,"A golden troop of birds,"
6745,N. M. F.,Caged in a little volume made to love;
6746,N. M. F.,"Singing, singing,"
6747,N. M. F.,"Flinging, flinging"
6748,N. M. F.,"Their breaking hearts on mine, and swiftly bringing"
6749,N. M. F.,"Tears, and the peace thereof."
6750,N. M. F.,How the world woke anew!
6751,N. M. F.,How the days broke anew!
6752,N. M. F.,Before my tear-blind eyes a tapestry
6753,N. M. F.,"I seemed to see,"
6754,N. M. F.,Woven of all the dreams dead or to be.
6755,N. M. F.,"Hills, hills of song, Springs of eternal bloom,"
6756,N. M. F.,Autumns of golden pomp and purple gloom
6757,N. M. F.,Were hung upon his loom.
6758,N. M. F.,"Winters of pain, roses with awful thorns,"
6759,N. M. F.,Yet wondrous faith in God's dew-drenched morns --
6760,N. M. F.,"These, all these I saw,"
6761,N. M. F.,With that ecstatic awe
6762,N. M. F.,Wherewith one looks into Eternity.
6763,N. M. F.,
6764,N. M. F.,"And then I knew that, though I had not heard"
6765,N. M. F.,"His voice before,"
6766,N. M. F.,"His quiet singing, like some quiet bird"
6767,N. M. F.,"At some one's distant door,"
6768,N. M. F.,Had made my own more sweet; had made it more
6769,N. M. F.,"Lovely, in one of God's miraculous ways."
6770,N. M. F.,I knew then why the days
6771,N. M. F.,Had seemed to me more perfect when the Spring
6772,N. M. F.,Came with old bourgeoning;
6773,N. M. F.,"For somewhere in the world his voice was raised,"
6774,N. M. F.,And somewhere in the world his heart was breaking;
6775,N. M. F.,"And never a flower but knew it, sweetly taking"
6776,N. M. F.,"Beauty more high and noble for his sake,"
6777,N. M. F.,As a whole wood grows lovelier for the wail
6778,N. M. F.,Of one sad nightingale.
6779,N. M. F.,
6780,N. M. F.,Yet if the Springs long past
6781,N. M. F.,"Seemed wonderful before I heard his voice,"
6782,N. M. F.,I tremble at the beauty I shall see
6783,N. M. F.,"In seasons still to be,"
6784,N. M. F.,Now that his songs are mine while Life shall last.
6785,N. M. F.,O now for me
6786,N. M. F.,New floods of vision open suddenly . . .
6787,N. M. F.,"Rejoice, my heart!  Rejoice"
6788,N. M. F.,That you have heard the Quiet Singer's voice!

6840,N. M. F.,
6841,N. M. F.,"Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,"
6842,N. M. F.,Grew lean while he assailed the seasons;
6843,N. M. F.,"He wept that he was ever born,"

6845,N. M. F.,
6846,N. M. F.,Miniver loved the days of old
6847,N. M. F.,When swords were bright and steeds were prancing;
6848,N. M. F.,The vision of a warrior bold

6850,N. M. F.,
6851,N. M. F.,"Miniver sighed for what was not,"

6855,N. M. F.,
6856,N. M. F.,Miniver mourned the ripe renown
6857,N. M. F.,That made so many a name so fragrant;
6858,N. M. F.,"He mourned Romance, now on the town,"

6860,N. M. F.,
6861,N. M. F.,"Miniver loved the Medici,"

6865,N. M. F.,
6866,N. M. F.,Miniver cursed the commonplace

6871,N. M. F.,"Miniver scorned the gold he sought,"

6876,N. M. F.,"Miniver Cheevy, born too late,"

6933,N. M. F.,"Onward I ride in the blowing oats,"
6934,N. M. F.,Checking the field-lark's rippling notes --
6935,N. M. F.,Lightly I sweep
6936,N. M. F.,From steep to steep:
6937,N. M. F.,Over my head through the branches high

6939,N. M. F.,The tall oats brush my horse's flanks;
6940,N. M. F.,Wild poppies crowd on the sunny banks;

6980,N. M. F.,Deep within dreams he led me out of doors

6986,N. M. F.,"What saw I then, what heard?"
6987,N. M. F.,"Multitudes, multitudes, under the moon they stirred!"
6988,N. M. F.,The weaker brothers of our earthly breed;

6997,N. M. F.,"Bewildered, driven, hiding, fluttering, mute!"

6999,N. M. F.,Pass and become as nothing in the night.
7000,N. M. F.,Clothed on with red they were who once were white;
7001,N. M. F.,"Drooping, who once led armies to the sun,"

7008,N. M. F.,
7009,N. M. F.,O who would take away music from the earth?
7010,N. M. F.,Have we so much?  Or love upon the hearth?
7011,N. M. F.,No more -- they faded;
7012,N. M. F.,The great trees bending between birth and birth
7013,N. M. F.,"Sighed for them, and the night wind's hoarse rebuff"
7014,N. M. F.,Shouted the shame of which I was persuaded.
7015,N. M. F.,Shall Nature's only pausing be by men invaded?
7016,N. M. F.,Or shall we lay grief's fagots on her shoulders bare?
7017,N. M. F.,Has she not borne enough?
7018,N. M. F.,"Soon will the mirroring woodland pools begin to con her,"
7019,N. M. F.,And her sad immemorial passion come upon her;

7030,N. M. F.,"What, lower, was a bird, but now"
7031,N. M. F.,Is moored and altered quite
7032,N. M. F.,Into an island of unshaded joy?
7033,N. M. F.,To whom the mate below upon the bough
7034,N. M. F.,Shouts once and brings him from his high employ.
7035,N. M. F.,Yet speeding he forgot not of the cloud
7036,N. M. F.,"Where he from glory sprang and burned aloud,"
7037,N. M. F.,"But took a little of the day,"
7038,N. M. F.,"A little of the colored sky,"
7039,N. M. F.,And of the joy that would not stay
7040,N. M. F.,He wove a song that cannot die.
7041,N. M. F.,"Then, then -- the unfathomable shame;"
7042,N. M. F.,"The one last wrong arose from out the flame,"
7043,N. M. F.,The ravening hate that hated not was hurled

7046,N. M. F.,And one more blindness in the unseen air.

7060,N. M. F.,"In morning air all Indian-Summer sweet,"
7061,N. M. F.,"And crept upstream, through wood or field or brake,"
7062,N. M. F.,Most tremblingly to take
7063,N. M. F.,What crumbs that from the Master's table fell.
7064,N. M. F.,"Cry with what thronging thunders they were met,"
7065,N. M. F.,And hide not how the least leaf was made wet.
7066,N. M. F.,Cry till no watcher says that all is well
7067,N. M. F.,With raucous discord through the leaning spheres.
7068,N. M. F.,But tell
7069,N. M. F.,"With tears, with tears"

7071,N. M. F.,"Who on these dawns are fire, at dusk are clay."

7102,N. M. F.,"People untroubled by a Fate's veiled eyes,"
7103,N. M. F.,Leave us upon an earth of faith forlorn.
7104,N. M. F.,No more wild tidings from the sweet far skies
7105,N. M. F.,Of love's long utmost heavenward endeavor.
7106,N. M. F.,So shall the silence pour on us forever
7107,N. M. F.,The streaming arrows of unutterable scorn.

7285,II,
7286,II,When red dusk makes the western sky
7287,II,"A fire-lit window through the firs,"
7288,II,He stoops to see the red fox die
7289,II,Among the chestnut's broken burrs.
7290,II,
7291,II,"Then fanfaree and fanfaree,"
7292,II,His bugle sounds; the world below
7293,II,Grows hushed to hear; and two or three
7294,II,Soft stars dream through the afterglow.

7296,II,
7297,III,III
7298,III,
7299,III,"Like some black host the shadows fall,"
7300,III,And blackness camps among the trees;
7301,III,"Each wildwood road, a Goblin Hall,"
7302,III,Grows populous with mysteries.
7303,III,
7304,III,"Night comes with brows of ragged storm,"
7305,III,And limbs of writhen cloud and mist;
7306,III,The rain-wind hangs upon his arm
7307,III,Like some wild girl who cries unkissed.
7308,III,
7309,III,By his gaunt hands the leaves are shed
7310,III,In headlong troops and nightmare herds;
7311,III,"And, like a witch who calls the dead,"
7312,III,The hill-stream whirls with foaming words.
7313,III,
7314,III,Then all is sudden silence and
7315,III,"Dark fear -- like his who cannot see,"
7316,III,"Yet hears, lost in a haunted land,"
7317,III,Death rattling on a gallow's-tree.
7318,III,
7319,III,

7321,IV,
7322,IV,The days approach again; the days
7323,IV,"Whose mantles stream, whose sandals drag,"
7324,IV,When in the haze by puddled ways
7325,IV,The gnarled thorn seems a crooked hag.
7326,IV,
7327,IV,When rotting orchards reek with rain;
7328,IV,"And woodlands crumble, leaf and log;"
7329,IV,And in the drizzling yard again
7330,IV,The gourd is tagged with points of fog.
7331,IV,
7332,IV,Now let me seat my soul among
7333,IV,"The woods' dim dreams, and come in touch"
7334,IV,"With melancholy, sad of tongue"
7335,IV,"And sweet, who says so much, so much."

7342,IV,
7343,IV,
7344,IV,Now along the solemn heights

7347,IV,Glide the days and nights.
7348,IV,
7349,IV,"Little kindred of the grass,"
7350,IV,Like a shadow in a glass
7351,IV,Falls the dark and falls the stillness;
7352,IV,We must rise and pass.
7353,IV,
7354,IV,"We must rise and follow, wending"
7355,IV,"Where the nights and days have ending, --"
7356,IV,Pass in order pale and slow

7358,IV,
7359,IV,"Little brothers of the clod,"
7360,IV,"Soul of fire and seed of sod,"
7361,IV,We must fare into the silence
7362,IV,At the knees of God.
7363,IV,
7364,IV,"Little comrades of the sky,"
7365,IV,"Wing to wing we wander by,"
7366,IV,"Going, going, going, going,"
7367,IV,Softly as a sigh.
7368,IV,
7369,IV,"Hark, the moving shapes confer,"
7370,IV,"Globe of dew and gossamer,"
7371,IV,Fading and ephemeral spirits
7372,IV,In the dusk astir.
7373,IV,
7374,IV,"Moth and blossom, blade and bee,"
7375,IV,"Worlds must go as well as we,"
7376,IV,In the long procession joining
7377,IV,Mount and star and sea.
7378,IV,
7379,IV,Toward the shadowy brink we climb
7380,IV,"Where the round year rolls sublime,"
7381,IV,"Rolls, and drops, and falls forever"
7382,IV,In the vast of time.
7383,IV,
7384,IV,Like a plummet plunging deep
7385,IV,"Past the utmost reach of sleep,"
7386,IV,Till remembrance has no longer
7387,IV,Care to laugh or weep.

7399,IV,"The sun is smiling, so am I."
7400,IV,Why do I smile?  Why do I weep?
7401,IV,I do not know; it lies too deep.
7402,IV,
7403,IV,"I hear the winds of autumn sigh,"
7404,IV,"They break my heart, they make me cry;"
7405,IV,"I hear the birds of lovely spring,"

7421,IV,
7422,IV,I know I must be old (how age deceives!)
7423,IV,"I know I must be old, for, all unseen,"
7424,IV,"My heart grows young, as autumn fields grow green,"
7425,IV,When late rains patter on the falling sheaves.
7426,IV,
7427,IV,I know I must be tired (and tired souls err) --
7428,IV,"I know I must be tired, for all my soul"
7429,IV,"To deeds of daring beats a glad, faint roll,"
7430,IV,As storms the riven pine to music stir.
7431,IV,
7432,IV,I know I must be dying (Death draws near) --
7433,IV,"I know I must be dying, for I crave"
7434,IV,"Life -- life, strong life, and think not of the grave,"
7435,IV,"And turf-bound silence, in the frosty year."

7547,IV,"[The format of these notes has been slightly altered.  Most notably,"
7548,IV,"dates (hopefully correct, but not very certain for the lesser known poets)"
7549,IV,"have been added -- when available -- in square brackets after each name,"
7550,IV,and the number of poems by that author in this anthology is in parentheses.
7551,IV,"These notes (first included in 1917, whereas the selections were made in 1913)"
7552,IV,"combined with the searchability of electronic texts,"
7553,IV,"renders the original Indexes of Authors and of First Lines obsolete,"
7554,IV,"and so both have been dropped.  Occasionally, further information follows"
7555,IV,"in angled brackets.  -- A. L., 1998.]"

7560,IV,"Born at Leicester, Vermont.  Received her early education in that State."
7561,IV,"After a short period of teaching, she became a newspaper writer"
7562,IV,and contributed to various periodicals and syndicates.
7563,IV,"Her journalistic period closed with editorial work upon ""Hampton's Magazine"""
7564,IV,in 1909 and 1910.  Since that date she has published several books
7565,IV,"in different fields of literature:  ""The Son of Mary Bethel"","
7566,IV,"a novel, putting the character of Christ in modern setting; ""Stories from"
7567,IV,"the New Testament, for Children""; ""Letters of a Living Dead Man"","
7568,IV,psychic communications which have attracted much attention;
7569,IV,"and in poetry, ""The Frozen Grail, and Other Poems"", 1910;"
7570,IV,"""The Book of Love"", 1912; and ""Songs of a Vagrom Angel"", 1916."
7571,IV,"Mrs. Barker's poem, ""The Frozen Grail"", addressed to Peary, the explorer,"
7572,IV,"did much, as he has testified, to inspire him, and was upon his person"
7573,IV,when he finally achieved the North Pole.

7575,IV,"Braithwaite, William Stanley.  [1878-1962]  (1)"
7576,IV,"Born at Boston, December 6, 1878.  Educated in the public schools"
7577,IV,"of that city.  He has published two volumes of his own verse,"
7578,IV,"""Lyrics of Life and Love"", 1904, and ""The House of Falling Leaves"", 1908,"
7579,IV,but has given his time chiefly to editorial and critical work.
7580,IV,Mr. Braithwaite edited three excellent anthologies:
7581,IV,"""The Book of Elizabethan Verse"", ""The Book of Restoration Verse"","
7582,IV,"and ""The Book of Georgian Verse"", but has turned his entire attention,"
7583,IV,"for several years past, to contemporary American poetry,"
7584,IV,"having founded and edited ""The Poetry Journal of Boston"","
7585,IV,"""The Poetry Review of America"", etc.  Mr. Braithwaite summarizes each year"
7586,IV,"for the ""Boston Transcript"" the poetic output of the American magazines,"
7587,IV,"and publishes, in an ""Anthology of Magazine Verse"", what he regards"
7588,IV,as the best poems printed in our periodicals during the year.

7590,IV,"Branch, Anna Hempstead.  [1875-1937]  (3)"

7592,IV,Smith College in 1897 and from the American Academy of Dramatic Art
7593,IV,"in New York City in 1900.  While at college she began writing poetry,"
7594,IV,and the year after her graduation won the first prize awarded
7595,IV,"by the ""Century Magazine"" for a poem written by a college graduate."
7596,IV,"This poem, ""The Road 'Twixt Heaven and Hell"", was printed in"
7597,IV,"the ""Century Magazine"" for December, 1898, and was followed soon after by"
7598,IV,"the publication of Miss Branch's first volume, ""The Heart of the Road"", 1901."
7599,IV,"She has since published two volumes, ""The Shoes that Danced"", 1902,"
7600,IV,"and ""Rose of the Wind"", 1910, both marked by imagination and beauty"

7607,IV,"best-known volumes are ""Meadow Grass"", a collection of short stories;"
7608,IV,"""Tiverton Tales""; ""The Mannerings""; ""Margaret Warrener""; ""Rose MacLeod"";"

7610,IV,"given by Winthrop Ames, for the best play submitted to him"
7611,IV,"by an American writer.  This drama, ""Children of Earth"","
7612,IV,was produced the following season at the Booth Theater in New York.
7613,IV,"In poetry Miss Brown has done but one volume, ""The Road to Castaly"", 1896,"
7614,IV,"reprinted with new poems in 1917, but this is so fine in quality"
7615,IV,as to give her a distinct place among American poets.

7617,IV,"Burton, Richard.  [1861-1940]  (3)"
7618,IV,"Born at Hartford, Connecticut, March 14, 1859 [sic].  Received the degree"
7619,IV,of A.B. from Trinity College in 1883 and of Ph.D. from John Hopkins University
7620,IV,in 1888.  He entered journalism and became for a short time
7621,IV,"managing editor of ""The Churchman"", leaving this position to become"
7622,IV,"literary editor of the ""Hartford Courant"", where he remained"
7623,IV,from 1890 to 1897.  During this period he was also associate editor
7624,IV,"of the ""Warner Library of the World's Best Literature"".  In 1902"
7625,IV,"he went to Boston as literary editor of the Lothrop Publishing Company,"
7626,IV,"remaining until 1904.  Previous to this time, Dr. Burton had been"
7627,IV,lecturing widely upon poetry and the drama and spent the succeeding two years
7628,IV,chiefly engaged in this work.  In 1906 he became the head
7629,IV,"of the English Department of the University of Minnesota,"
7630,IV,"which position he still holds, although the scholastic year"
7631,IV,is broken annually by a lecture tour through the East.
7632,IV,Dr. Burton has published many volumes of poetry and several upon the drama.
7633,IV,"Among the former one may cite as most representative:  ""Dumb in June"", 1895;"
7634,IV,"""Lyrics of Brotherhood"", 1899; ""Message and Melody"", 1903;"

7642,IV,"of ""McClure's Magazine"" and literary editor of McClure, Phillips & Company"
7643,IV,until 1906.  Since that period he has devoted himself chiefly
7644,IV,"to the writing of poetry and poetic drama.  His first volume,"
7645,IV,"""An Ode to Harvard, and Other Poems"", was published in 1907."
7646,IV,"This has been followed by the poetic dramas, ""Tiger"", 1913,"
7647,IV,"and ""The Little King"", 1917, both of which have had stage presentation,"
7648,IV,"and by ""The New World"", 1915, amplified from his Phi Beta Kappa Poem"

7653,IV,"Bliss Carman was born at Fredericton, New Brunswick, April 15, 1861."
7654,IV,He received the degree of A.B. from the University of New Brunswick in 1881
7655,IV,and of A.M. in 1884.  He studied also at Harvard and at
7656,IV,"the University of Edinburgh.  Like most poets, Mr. Carman served his period"
7657,IV,"in journalism, being office editor of ""The Independent"" from 1890 to 1892,"
7658,IV,"and editor of ""The Chap-Book"" in 1894.  He has, however,"
7659,IV,"given almost his sole allegiance to poetry and has published many books,"
7660,IV,"chiefly of nature, interspersed now and then with volumes dealing with"
7661,IV,"myth or mysticism.  His first volume was ""Low Tide on Grand Pre"","
7662,IV,"which appeared in 1893, and revealed at the outset his remarkable lyric gift"
7663,IV,and his sensitive feeling for nature.  In collaboration with Richard Hovey
7664,IV,"he did the well-known ""Vagabondia Books"", -- ""Songs from Vagabondia"", 1894;"
7665,IV,"""More Songs from Vagabondia"", 1896; and ""Last Songs from Vagabondia"", 1900, --"
7666,IV,"which introduced a new note into American poetry, and appearing, as they did,"
7667,IV,"in the nineties, formed a wholesome contrast to some of the work"
7668,IV,"then emanating from the ""Decadent School"" in England."
7669,IV,"Among the finest of Mr. Carman's volumes, aside from his work"
7670,IV,"with Richard Hovey, are ""Behind the Arras:  A Book of the Unseen"", 1895;"
7671,IV,"""Ballads of Lost Haven"", 1897; ""By the Aurelian Wall, and Other Elegies"","

7677,IV,"Cather, Willa Sibert.  [1873-1947]  (1)"
7678,IV,"Born at Winchester, Virginia, December 7, 1875 [sic].  During her childhood"
7679,IV,"the family moved to Nebraska, and in 1895 Miss Cather was graduated from"
7680,IV,"the University of that State.  Coming East to engage in newspaper work,"
7681,IV,"she became associated with the staff of the ""Pittsburgh Daily Leader"","
7682,IV,"where she remained from 1897 to 1901.  Soon after, she became"
7683,IV,"one of the editors of ""McClure's Magazine"", doing important feature articles"
7684,IV,"until 1912.  Miss Cather is now writing fiction, and has published"
7685,IV,"three novels, ""Alexander's Bridge"", ""O Pioneers!"" and ""The Song of the Lark""."
7686,IV,"In poetry, she has done but one small volume, ""April Twilight"", 1903,"
7687,IV,but several poems from this collection seem likely to make for themselves
7688,IV,a permanent place.

7692,IV,of that city.  He began writing very early and published his first
7693,IV,"book of verse, ""Blooms of the Berry"", 1887, when but twenty-two years of age."
7694,IV,"From that time until his death, December 7, 1915 [sic],"
7695,IV,he published many volumes of poetry inspired chiefly by the theme of nature.
7696,IV,"As most of these volumes are out of print, it is unnecessary to list them all,"

7707,IV,"From the publication of his first little volume, ""Blooms of the Berry"","
7708,IV,"he had made himself the intimate, almost the mystic, comrade of nature."
7709,IV,"He had an ecstatic sense of the visible world.  Beauty was his religion,"
7710,IV,and he spent his life learning the ways and moods of nature and declaring them
7711,IV,"in poetry rich in imagination.  He had the naturalist's eagerness for truth,"
7712,IV,and one might explore the Kentucky woods and fields
7713,IV,with a volume of his poetry as a handbook and find the least regarded flower
7714,IV,"minutely celebrated.  In his most affluent fancy his eye never left the fact,"
7715,IV,and the accuracy of his observation gives his nature work a background
7716,IV,which adds greatly to its value.

7820,IV,"Her father, Patrick Guiney, was a brigadier-general in our Civil War,"
7821,IV,and having been born during the period of the conflict and her early youth
7822,IV,"having been spent almost before the echo of the guns had died,"
7823,IV,Miss Guiney's work was much influenced by this background of association.
7824,IV,The symbolism of her poetry is frequently drawn from battle
7825,IV,"or from knight-errantry, as in ""The Wild Ride"", ""The Kings"","
7826,IV,"""The Vigil-at-Arms"", ""The Knight Errant"", ""Memorial Day"", etc."
7827,IV,"Valor, transmuted to a spiritual quality, may, indeed, be said to be"

7829,IV,"best illustrated in her poem, ""Beati Mortui"", a Celtic note,"
7830,IV,"shown so exquisitely in her ""Irish Peasant Song"", and one has"
7831,IV,"the more obvious characteristics of poetry that, whatever its theme,"

7856,IV,which he afterward celebrated in several of his best-known poems.
7857,IV,"In collaboration with Bliss Carman he did the well known ""Vagabondia Books"","
7858,IV,"-- ""Songs from Vagabondia"", 1894; ""More Songs from Vagabondia"", 1896;"
7859,IV,"""Last Songs from Vagabondia"", 1900, -- books whose freshness and charm"
7860,IV,immediately won them a place in public favor that time has not lessened.
7861,IV,"Aside from his work with Mr. Carman and his lyric collection,"
7862,IV,"""Along the Trail"", 1898, Hovey had done a remarkable group of poetic dramas"

7865,IV,"A Tragedy"", 1898; ""The Birth of Galahad:  A Romantic Drama"", 1898;"

7869,IV,"in 1907.  The dramas stand for a dramatic achievement of a high order,"
7870,IV,"and contain poetry of great beauty, reaching at times,"
7871,IV,"in the lyric masque of ""Taliesin"", an almost consummate expression."
7872,IV,"Richard Hovey was, indeed, both in lyric and dramatic work,"
7873,IV,a poet of rare endowment and his early death was a distinct loss
7874,IV,to American letters.

8003,IV,in herding sheep and riding the ranges after the cattle.
8004,IV,"Later, when the cattle ranges turned into farms, he worked in the fields"
8005,IV,and in autumn joined the threshers on their route from farm to farm.
8006,IV,"During his boyhood he attended school but three months in the year, but later"
8007,IV,studied at San Jose Normal School and the University of California.
8008,IV,"His first books were earned, when a lad on the ranch, by ploughing"
8009,IV,a twenty-acre lot at a dollar an acre and investing the entire sum
8010,IV,"in the works of the great poets.  Thereafter, when he rode the ranges,"
8011,IV,"he balanced his saddle bags with Keats and Shelley.  It was, indeed,"
8012,IV,"largely due to the democracy of Shelley, coupled with his own"
8013,IV,"early experiences, that his genius took the social bent"
8014,IV,"which distinguishes it.  After leaving the University, Mr. Markham became"
8015,IV,a teacher in California and was principal and superintendent
8016,IV,"of several schools until 1899, when he sprang suddenly into fame"
8017,IV,"by the publication in the ""San Francisco Examiner"" of his poem"
8018,IV,"""The Man With the Hoe"".  This poem, crystallizing as it did"
8019,IV,"the spirit of the time, and emphasizing one's obligation to Society,"
8020,IV,"became the impulse of the whole social movement in poetry, a movement"
8021,IV,which largely prevailed during the early years of the twentieth century.
8022,IV,"After the great success of ""The Man With the Hoe"", Mr. Markham removed"
8023,IV,"from California to New York City, where he has since been engaged"
8024,IV,in literary work.  His volumes of poetry in their order are:
8025,IV,"""The Man With the Hoe, and Other Poems"", 1899; ""Lincoln, and Other Poems"","

8048,IV,"in the University of Chicago, where he remained until 1903."
8049,IV,"His period of teaching, however, was relieved by several trips abroad,"
8050,IV,on one of which he visited Greece and re-read the entire body of Greek tragedy
8051,IV,"with the background of the scenes which produced it.  The Greek influence,"
8052,IV,"dominant in his work, reaches its finest expression in ""The Fire-Bringer"","
8053,IV,a poetic drama of great beauty and philosophical depth.
8054,IV,"This drama is one of a trilogy of which it is the first member,"

8056,IV,The last was in process of writing at Mr. Moody's death
8057,IV,"and only fragments of it have been published.  This trilogy,"
8058,IV,"profound in its spiritual meaning and artistic in execution,"
8059,IV,would alone be sufficient to place Moody among the major poets
8060,IV,had he not left us a body of lyric poetry of equal distinction.
8061,IV,"Moody first attracted wide attention by ""An Ode in Time of Hesitation"","
8062,IV,written in relation to the annexation of the Philippine Islands
