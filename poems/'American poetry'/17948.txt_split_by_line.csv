51,PREFACE,
52,PREFACE,
53,PREFACE,The aim of this edition of the _Vision of Sir Launfal_ is to furnish
54,PREFACE,the material that must be used in any adequate treatment of the poem
55,PREFACE,"in the class room, and to suggest other material that may be used in"
56,PREFACE,the more leisurely and fruitful method of study that is sometimes
57,PREFACE,possible in spite of the restrictions of arbitrary courses of study.
58,PREFACE,
59,PREFACE,"In interpreting the poem with young students, special emphasis should"
60,PREFACE,"be given to the ethical significance, the broad appeal to human"
61,PREFACE,"sympathy and the sense of a common brotherhood of men, an appeal that"
62,PREFACE,is in accord with the altruistic tendencies of the present time; to
63,PREFACE,"the intimate appreciation and love of nature expressed in the poem,"
64,PREFACE,feelings also in accord with the present movement of cultured minds
65,PREFACE,toward the natural world; to the lofty and inspiring idealism of
66,PREFACE,"Lowell, as revealed in the poems included in this volume and in his"
67,PREFACE,"biography, and also as contrasted with current materialism; and,"
68,PREFACE,"finally, to the romantic sources of the story in the legends of King"
69,PREFACE,"Arthur and his table round, a region of literary delight too generally"
70,PREFACE,unknown to present-day students.
71,PREFACE,
72,PREFACE,"After these general topics, it is assumed that such matters as"
73,PREFACE,literary structure and poetic beauty will receive due attention. If
74,PREFACE,"the technical faults of the poem, which critics are at much pains to"
75,PREFACE,"point out, are not discovered by the student, his knowledge will be"
76,PREFACE,quite as profitable. Additional reading in Lowell's works should be
77,PREFACE,"secured, and can be through the sympathetic interest and enthusiasm of"
78,PREFACE,the instructor. The following selections may be used for rapid
79,PREFACE,"examination and discussion: _Under the Willows, The First Snow-Fall,"
80,PREFACE,"Under the Old Elm, Auf Wiedersehen, Sunthin' in the Pastoral Line,"
81,PREFACE,"Jonathan to John, Mr. Hosea Biglow to the Editor of the Atlantic"
82,PREFACE,"Monthly_, and the prose essays _My Garden Acquaintance_ and _A Good"
83,PREFACE,Word for Winter_. The opportunity should not be lost for making the
84,PREFACE,"students forever and interestedly acquainted with Lowell, with the"
85,PREFACE,poet and the man.
86,PREFACE,
87,PREFACE,The editor naturally does not assume responsibility for the character
88,PREFACE,"of the examination questions given, at the end of this volume. They"
89,PREFACE,are questions that have been used in recent years in college entrance
90,PREFACE,papers by two eminent examination boards.

181,LIFE OF LOWELL,
182,LIFE OF LOWELL,
183,LIFE OF LOWELL,In Cambridge there are two literary shrines to which visitors are sure
184,LIFE OF LOWELL,"to find their way soon after passing the Harvard gates, ""Craigie"
185,LIFE OF LOWELL,"House,"" the home of Longfellow and ""Elmwood,"" the home of Lowell."
186,LIFE OF LOWELL,Though their hallowed retirement has been profaned by the
187,LIFE OF LOWELL,"encroachments of the growing city, yet in their simple dignity these"
188,LIFE OF LOWELL,fine old colonial mansions still bespeak the noble associations of the
189,LIFE OF LOWELL,"past, and stand as memorials of the finest products of American"
190,LIFE OF LOWELL,culture.
191,LIFE OF LOWELL,
192,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Elmwood was built before the Revolution by Thomas Oliver, the Tory"
193,LIFE OF LOWELL,"governor, who signed his abdication at the invitation of a committee"
194,LIFE OF LOWELL,"of ""about four thousand people"" who surrounded his house at Cambridge."
195,LIFE OF LOWELL,The property was confiscated by the Commonwealth and used by the
196,LIFE OF LOWELL,American army during the war. In 1818 it was purchased by the Rev.
197,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Charles Lowell, pastor of the West Congregational Church in Boston,"
198,LIFE OF LOWELL,"and after ninety years it is still the family home. Here was born,"
199,LIFE OF LOWELL,"February 22, 1819, James Russell Lowell, with surroundings most"
200,LIFE OF LOWELL,propitious for the nurturing of a poet-soul. Within the stately home
201,LIFE OF LOWELL,there was a refined family life; the father had profited by the
202,LIFE OF LOWELL,"unusual privilege of three years' study abroad, and his library of"
203,LIFE OF LOWELL,"some four thousand volumes was not limited to theology; the mother,"
204,LIFE OF LOWELL,whose maiden name was Spence and who traced her Scotch ancestry back
205,LIFE OF LOWELL,"to the hero of the ballad of _Sir Patrick Spens_, taught her children"
206,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the good old ballads and the romantic stories in the _Fairie Queen_,"
207,LIFE OF LOWELL,and it was one of the poet's earliest delights to recount the
208,LIFE OF LOWELL,adventures of Spenser's heroes and heroines to his playmates.
209,LIFE OF LOWELL,
210,LIFE OF LOWELL,An equally important influence upon his early youth was the
211,LIFE OF LOWELL,out-of-door life at Elmwood. To the love of nature his soul was early
212,LIFE OF LOWELL,"dedicated, and no American poet has more truthfully and beautifully"
213,LIFE OF LOWELL,"interpreted the inspired teachings of nature, whispered through the"
214,LIFE OF LOWELL,solemn tree-tops or caroled by the happy birds. The open fields
215,LIFE OF LOWELL,surrounding Elmwood and the farms for miles around were his familiar
216,LIFE OF LOWELL,"playground, and furnished daily adventures for his curious and eager"
217,LIFE OF LOWELL,"mind. The mere delight of this experience with nature, he says, ""made"
218,LIFE OF LOWELL,my childhood the richest part of my life. It seems to me as if I had
219,LIFE OF LOWELL,never seen nature again since those old days when the balancing of a
220,LIFE OF LOWELL,yellow butterfly over a thistle bloom was spiritual food and lodging
221,LIFE OF LOWELL,"for a whole forenoon."" In the _Cathedral_ is an autobiographic passage"
222,LIFE OF LOWELL,describing in a series of charming pictures some of those choice hours
223,LIFE OF LOWELL,of childhood:
224,LIFE OF LOWELL,
225,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""One summer hour abides, what time I perched,"
226,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Dappled with noonday, under simmering leaves,"
227,LIFE OF LOWELL,"And pulled the pulpy oxhearts, while aloof"
228,LIFE OF LOWELL,"An oriole clattered and the robins shrilled,"
229,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Denouncing me an alien and a thief."""
230,LIFE OF LOWELL,
231,LIFE OF LOWELL,Quite like other boys Lowell was subjected to the processes of the
232,LIFE OF LOWELL,"more formal education of books. He was first sent to a ""dame school,"""
233,LIFE OF LOWELL,"and then to the private school of William Wells, under whose rigid"
234,LIFE OF LOWELL,tuition he became thoroughly grounded in the classics. Among his
235,LIFE OF LOWELL,"schoolfellows was W.W. Story, the poet-sculptor, who continued his"
236,LIFE OF LOWELL,"life-long friend. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who was one of the"
237,LIFE OF LOWELL,"younger boys of the school, recalls the high talk of Story and Lowell"
238,LIFE OF LOWELL,"about the _Fairie Queen_. At fifteen he entered Harvard College, then"
239,LIFE OF LOWELL,an institution with about two hundred students. The course of study
240,LIFE OF LOWELL,"in those days was narrow and dull, a pretty steady diet of Greek,"
241,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Latin and Mathematics, with an occasional dessert of Paley's"
242,LIFE OF LOWELL,_Evidences of Christianity_ or Butler's _Analogy_. Lowell was not
243,LIFE OF LOWELL,"distinguished for scholarship, but he read omnivorously and wrote"
244,LIFE OF LOWELL,"copiously, often in smooth flowing verse, fashioned after the accepted"
245,LIFE OF LOWELL,"English models of the period. He was an editor of _Harvardiana_, the"
246,LIFE OF LOWELL,"college magazine, and was elected class poet in his senior year. But"
247,LIFE OF LOWELL,his habit of lounging with the poets in the secluded alcoves of the
248,LIFE OF LOWELL,"old library, in preference to attending recitations, finally became"
249,LIFE OF LOWELL,"too scandalous for official forbearance, and he was rusticated, ""on"
250,LIFE OF LOWELL,"account of constant neglect of his college duties,"" as the faculty"
251,LIFE OF LOWELL,"records state. He was sent to Concord, where his exile was not without"
252,LIFE OF LOWELL,"mitigating profit, as he became acquainted with Emerson and Thoreau."
253,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Here he wrote the class poem, which he was permitted to circulate in"
254,LIFE OF LOWELL,"print at his Commencement. This production, which now stands at the"
255,LIFE OF LOWELL,"head of the list of his published works, was curiously unprophetic of"
256,LIFE OF LOWELL,"his later tendencies. It was written in the neatly, polished couplets"
257,LIFE OF LOWELL,"of the Pope type and other imitative metres, and aimed to satirize the"
258,LIFE OF LOWELL,"radical movements of the period, especially the transcendentalists and"
259,LIFE OF LOWELL,"abolitionists, with both of whom he was soon to be in active sympathy."
260,LIFE OF LOWELL,
261,LIFE OF LOWELL,Lowell's first two years out of college were troubled with rather more
262,LIFE OF LOWELL,than the usual doubts and questionings that attend a young man's
263,LIFE OF LOWELL,"choice of a profession. He studied for a bachelor's degree in law,"
264,LIFE OF LOWELL,which he obtained in two years. But the work was done reluctantly. Law
265,LIFE OF LOWELL,"books, he says, ""I am reading with as few wry faces as I may."" Though"
266,LIFE OF LOWELL,"he was nominally practicing law for two years, there is no evidence"
267,LIFE OF LOWELL,"that he ever had a client, except the fictitious one so pleasantly"
268,LIFE OF LOWELL,"described in his first magazine article, entitled _My First Client_."
269,LIFE OF LOWELL,From Coke and Blackstone his mind would inevitably slip away to hold
270,LIFE OF LOWELL,more congenial communion with the poets. He became intensely
271,LIFE OF LOWELL,"interested in the old English dramatists, an interest that resulted in"
272,LIFE OF LOWELL,"his first series of literary articles, _The Old English Dramatists_,"
273,LIFE OF LOWELL,published in the _Boston Miscellany_. The favor with which these
274,LIFE OF LOWELL,"articles were received increased, he writes, the ""hope of being able"
275,LIFE OF LOWELL,"one day to support myself by my pen, and to leave a calling which I"
276,LIFE OF LOWELL,"hate, and for which I am not _well_ fitted, to say the least."""
277,LIFE OF LOWELL,
278,LIFE OF LOWELL,During this struggle between law and literature an influence came into
279,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Lowell's life that settled his purposes, directed his aspirations and"
280,LIFE OF LOWELL,essentially determined his career. In 1839 he writes to a friend about
281,LIFE OF LOWELL,"a ""very pleasant young lady,"" who ""knows more poetry than any one I am"
282,LIFE OF LOWELL,"acquainted with."" This pleasant young lady was Maria White, who became"
283,LIFE OF LOWELL,his wife in 1844. The loves of this young couple constitute one of the
284,LIFE OF LOWELL,"most pleasing episodes in the history of our literature, idyllic in"
285,LIFE OF LOWELL,"its simple beauty and inspiring in its spiritual perfectness. ""Miss"
286,LIFE OF LOWELL,"White was a woman of unusual loveliness,"" says Mr. Norton, ""and of"
287,LIFE OF LOWELL,"gifts of mind and heart still more unusual, which enabled her to enter"
288,LIFE OF LOWELL,with complete sympathy into her lover's intellectual life and to
289,LIFE OF LOWELL,"direct his genius to its highest aims."" She was herself a poet, and a"
290,LIFE OF LOWELL,little volume of her poems published privately after her death is an
291,LIFE OF LOWELL,evidence of her refined intellectual gifts and lofty spirit.
292,LIFE OF LOWELL,
293,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In 1841 Lowell published his first collection of poems, entitled _A"
294,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Year's Life_. The volume was dedicated to ""Una,"" a veiled admission of"
295,LIFE OF LOWELL,indebtedness for its inspiration to Miss White. Two poems
296,LIFE OF LOWELL,"particularly, _Irene_ and _My Love_, and the best in the volume, are"
297,LIFE OF LOWELL,rapturous expressions of his new inspiration. In later years he
298,LIFE OF LOWELL,"referred to the collection as ""poor windfalls of unripe experience."""
299,LIFE OF LOWELL,Only nine of the sixty-eight poems were preserved in subsequent
300,LIFE OF LOWELL,"collections. In 1843, with a young friend, Robert Carter, Lowell"
301,LIFE OF LOWELL,"launched a new magazine, _The Pioneer_, with the high purpose, as the"
302,LIFE OF LOWELL,"prospectus stated, of giving the public ""a rational substitute"" for"
303,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the ""namby-pamby love tales and sketches monthly poured out to them by"
304,LIFE OF LOWELL,"many of our popular magazines."" These young reformers did not know how"
305,LIFE OF LOWELL,strongly the great reading public is attached to its literary
306,LIFE OF LOWELL,"flesh-pots, and so the _Pioneer_ proved itself too good to live in"
307,LIFE OF LOWELL,just three months. The result of the venture to Lowell was an
308,LIFE OF LOWELL,interesting lesson in editorial work and a debt of eighteen hundred
309,LIFE OF LOWELL,"dollars. His next venture was a second volume of _Poems_, issued in"
310,LIFE OF LOWELL,"1844, in which the permanent lines of his poetic development appear"
311,LIFE OF LOWELL,more clearly than in _A Year's Life_. The tone of the first volume was
312,LIFE OF LOWELL,"uniformly serious, but in the second his muse's face begins to"
313,LIFE OF LOWELL,brighten with the occasional play of wit and humor. The volume was
314,LIFE OF LOWELL,heartily praised by the critics and his reputation as a new poet of
315,LIFE OF LOWELL,convincing distinction was established. In the following year appeared
316,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Conversations on Some of the Old Poets_, a volume of literary"
317,LIFE OF LOWELL,criticism interesting now mainly as pointing to maturer work in this
318,LIFE OF LOWELL,field.
319,LIFE OF LOWELL,
320,LIFE OF LOWELL,It is generally stated that the influence of Maria White made Lowell
321,LIFE OF LOWELL,"an Abolitionist, but this is only qualifiedly true. A year before he"
322,LIFE OF LOWELL,"had met her he wrote to a friend: ""The Abolitionists are the only ones"
323,LIFE OF LOWELL,"with whom I sympathize of the present extant parties."" Freedom,"
324,LIFE OF LOWELL,"justice, humanitarianism were fundamental to his native idealism."
325,LIFE OF LOWELL,Maria White's enthusiasm and devotion to the cause served to
326,LIFE OF LOWELL,crystallize his sentiments and to stimulate him to a practical
327,LIFE OF LOWELL,"participation in the movement. Both wrote for the _Liberty Bell_, an"
328,LIFE OF LOWELL,annual published in the interests of the anti-slavery agitation.
329,LIFE OF LOWELL,Immediately after their marriage they went to Philadelphia where
330,LIFE OF LOWELL,Lowell for a time was an editorial writer for the _Pennsylvania
331,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Freeman_, an anti-slavery journal once edited by Whittier. During the"
332,LIFE OF LOWELL,next six years he was a regular contributor to the _Anti-Slavery
333,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Standard_, published in New York. In all of this prose writing Lowell"
334,LIFE OF LOWELL,"exhibited the ardent spirit of the reformer, although he never adopted"
335,LIFE OF LOWELL,the extreme views of Garrison and others of the ultra-radical wing of
336,LIFE OF LOWELL,the party.
337,LIFE OF LOWELL,
338,LIFE OF LOWELL,But Lowell's greatest contribution to the anti-slavery cause was the
339,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Biglow Papers_, a series of satirical poems in the Yankee dialect,"
340,LIFE OF LOWELL,"aimed at the politicians who were responsible for the Mexican War, a"
341,LIFE OF LOWELL,"war undertaken, as he believed, in the interests of the Southern"
342,LIFE OF LOWELL,slaveholders. Hitherto the Abolitionists had been regarded with
343,LIFE OF LOWELL,"contempt by the conservative, complacent advocates of peace and"
344,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""compromise,"" and to join them was essentially to lose caste in the"
345,LIFE OF LOWELL,best society. But now a laughing prophet had arisen whose tongue was
346,LIFE OF LOWELL,tipped with fire. The _Biglow Papers_ was an unexpected blow to the
347,LIFE OF LOWELL,slave power. Never before had humor been used directly as a weapon in
348,LIFE OF LOWELL,political warfare. Soon the whole country was ringing with the homely
349,LIFE OF LOWELL,"phrases of Hosea Biglow's satiric humor, and deriding conservatism"
350,LIFE OF LOWELL,"began to change countenance. ""No speech, no plea, no appeal,"" says"
351,LIFE OF LOWELL,"George William Curtis, ""was comparable in popular and permanent effect"
352,LIFE OF LOWELL,"with this pitiless tempest of fire and hail, in the form of wit,"
353,LIFE OF LOWELL,"argument, satire, knowledge, insight, learning, common-sense, and"
354,LIFE OF LOWELL,"patriotism. It was humor of the purest strain, but humor in deadly"
355,LIFE OF LOWELL,"earnest."" As an embodiment of the elemental Yankee character and"
356,LIFE OF LOWELL,"speech it is a classic of final authority. Says Curtis, ""Burns did not"
357,LIFE OF LOWELL,give to the Scotch tongue a nobler immortality than Lowell gave to the
358,LIFE OF LOWELL,"dialect of New England."""
359,LIFE OF LOWELL,
360,LIFE OF LOWELL,The year 1848 was one of remarkably productive results for Lowell.
361,LIFE OF LOWELL,Besides the _Biglow Papers_ and some forty magazine articles and
362,LIFE OF LOWELL,"poems, he published a third collection of _Poems_, the _Vision of Sir"
363,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Launfal_, and the _Fable for Critics_. The various phases of his"
364,LIFE OF LOWELL,composite genius were nearly all represented in these volumes. The
365,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Fable_ was a good-natured satire upon his fellow authors, in which he"
366,LIFE OF LOWELL,touched up in rollicking rhymed couplets the merits and weaknesses of
367,LIFE OF LOWELL,"each, not omitting himself, with witty characterization and acute"
368,LIFE OF LOWELL,critical judgment; and it is still read for its delicious humor and
369,LIFE OF LOWELL,"sterling criticism. For example, the lines on Poe will always be"
370,LIFE OF LOWELL,quoted:
371,LIFE OF LOWELL,
372,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""There comes Poe, with his raven, like Barnaby Rudge,"
373,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Three-fifths of him genius and two-fifths sheer fudge."""
374,LIFE OF LOWELL,
375,LIFE OF LOWELL,And so the sketch of Hawthorne:
376,LIFE OF LOWELL,
377,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""There is Hawthorne, with genius so shrinking and rare"
378,LIFE OF LOWELL,That you hardly at first see the strength that is there;
379,LIFE OF LOWELL,"A frame so robust, with a nature so sweet,"
380,LIFE OF LOWELL,"So earnest, so graceful, so lithe and so fleet,"
381,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Is worth a descent from Olympus to meet."""
382,LIFE OF LOWELL,
383,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Lowell was now living in happy content at Elmwood. His father, whom he"
384,LIFE OF LOWELL,"once speaks of as a ""Dr. Primrose in the comparative degree,"" had lost"
385,LIFE OF LOWELL,"a large portion of his property, and literary journals in those days"
386,LIFE OF LOWELL,sent very small checks to young authors. So humble frugality was an
387,LIFE OF LOWELL,"attendant upon the high thinking of the poet couple, but this did not"
388,LIFE OF LOWELL,"matter, since the richest objects of their ideal world could be had"
389,LIFE OF LOWELL,without price. But clouds suddenly gathered over their beautiful
390,LIFE OF LOWELL,"lives. Four children were born, three of whom died in infancy."
391,LIFE OF LOWELL,Lowell's deep and lasting grief for his first-born is tenderly
392,LIFE OF LOWELL,recorded in the poems _She Came and Went_ and the _First Snow-Fall_.
393,LIFE OF LOWELL,"The volume of poems published in 1848 was ""reverently dedicated"" to"
394,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the memory of ""our little Blanche,"" and in the introductory poem"
395,LIFE OF LOWELL,"addressed ""To M.W.L."" he poured forth his sorrow like a libation of"
396,LIFE OF LOWELL,tears:
397,LIFE OF LOWELL,
398,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""I thought our love at fall, but I did err;"
399,LIFE OF LOWELL,Joy's wreath drooped o'er mine eyes: I could not see
400,LIFE OF LOWELL,That sorrow in our happy world must be
401,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Love's deepest spokesman and interpreter."""
402,LIFE OF LOWELL,
403,LIFE OF LOWELL,The year 1851-52 was spent abroad for the benefit of Mrs. Lowell's
404,LIFE OF LOWELL,"health, which was now precarious. At Rome their little son Walter"
405,LIFE OF LOWELL,"died, and one year after their return to Elmwood sorrow's crown of"
406,LIFE OF LOWELL,"sorrow came to the poet in the death of Mrs. Lowell, October, 1853."
407,LIFE OF LOWELL,"For years after the dear old home was to him _The Dead House_, as he"
408,LIFE OF LOWELL,wrote of it:
409,LIFE OF LOWELL,
410,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""For it died that autumn morning"
411,LIFE OF LOWELL,"When she, its soul, was borne"
412,LIFE OF LOWELL,To lie all dark on the hillside
413,LIFE OF LOWELL,"That looks over woodland and corn."""
414,LIFE OF LOWELL,
415,LIFE OF LOWELL,Before 1854 Lowell's literary success had been won mainly in verse.
416,LIFE OF LOWELL,"With the appearance in the magazines of _A Moosehead Journal_,"
417,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Fireside Travels_, and _Leaves from My Italian Journal_ his success"
418,LIFE OF LOWELL,"as a prose essayist began. Henceforth, and against his will, his prose"
419,LIFE OF LOWELL,was a stronger literary force than his poetry. He now gave a course of
420,LIFE OF LOWELL,"lectures on the English poets at the Lowell Institute, and during the"
421,LIFE OF LOWELL,progress of these lectures he received notice of his appointment to
422,LIFE OF LOWELL,succeed Longfellow in the professorship of the French and Spanish
423,LIFE OF LOWELL,languages and Belles-Lettres in Harvard College. A year was spent in
424,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Europe in preparation for his new work, and during the next twenty"
425,LIFE OF LOWELL,"years he faithfully performed the duties of the professorship, pouring"
426,LIFE OF LOWELL,forth the ripening fruits of his varied studies in lectures such as it
427,LIFE OF LOWELL,is not often the privilege of college students to hear. That pulling
428,LIFE OF LOWELL,in the yoke of this steady occupation was sometimes galling is shown
429,LIFE OF LOWELL,in his private letters. To W.D. Howells he wrote regretfully of the
430,LIFE OF LOWELL,"time and energy given to teaching, and of his conviction that he would"
431,LIFE OF LOWELL,"have been a better poet if he ""had not estranged the muse by donning a"
432,LIFE OF LOWELL,"professor's gown."" But a good teacher always bears in his left hand"
433,LIFE OF LOWELL,the lamp of sacrifice.
434,LIFE OF LOWELL,
435,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In 1857 Lowell was married to Miss Frances Dunlap, ""a woman of"
436,LIFE OF LOWELL,"remarkable gifts and grace of person and character,"" says Charles"
437,LIFE OF LOWELL,Eliot Norton. In the same year the _Atlantic Monthly_ was launched and
438,LIFE OF LOWELL,Lowell became its first editor. This position he held four years.
439,LIFE OF LOWELL,Under his painstaking and wise management the magazine quickly became
440,LIFE OF LOWELL,"what it has continued to be, the finest representative of true"
441,LIFE OF LOWELL,"literature among periodicals. In 1864 he joined his friend, Professor"
442,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Norton, in the editorship of the _North American Review_, to which he"
443,LIFE OF LOWELL,gave much of the distinction for which this periodical was once so
444,LIFE OF LOWELL,worthily famous. In this first appeared his masterly essays on the
445,LIFE OF LOWELL,"great poets, Chaucer, Dante, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Dryden, and"
446,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the others, which were gathered into the three volumes, _Among My"
447,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Books_, first and second series, and _My Study Windows_. Variety was"
448,LIFE OF LOWELL,given to this critical writing by such charming essays as _A Good Word
449,LIFE OF LOWELL,for Winter_ and the deliciously caustic paper _On a Certain
450,LIFE OF LOWELL,Condescension in Foreigners_.
451,LIFE OF LOWELL,
452,LIFE OF LOWELL,One of the strongest elements of Lowell's character was patriotism.
453,LIFE OF LOWELL,"His love of country and his native soil was not merely a principle, it"
454,LIFE OF LOWELL,was a passion. No American author has done so much to enlarge and
455,LIFE OF LOWELL,exalt the ideals of democracy. An intense interest in the welfare of
456,LIFE OF LOWELL,the nation broadened the scope of his literary work and led him at
457,LIFE OF LOWELL,times into active public life. During the Civil War he published a
458,LIFE OF LOWELL,"second series of _Biglow Papers_, in which, says Mr. Greenslet, ""we"
459,LIFE OF LOWELL,feel the vital stirring of the mind of Lowell as it was moved by the
460,LIFE OF LOWELL,great war; and if they never had quite the popular reverberation of
461,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the first series, they made deeper impression, and are a more"
462,LIFE OF LOWELL,"priceless possession of our literature."" When peace was declared in"
463,LIFE OF LOWELL,"April, 1865, he wrote to Professor Norton: ""The news, my dear Charles,"
464,LIFE OF LOWELL,is from Heaven. I felt a strange and tender exaltation. I wanted to
465,LIFE OF LOWELL,"laugh and I wanted to cry, and ended by holding my peace and feeling"
466,LIFE OF LOWELL,devoutly thankful. There is something magnificent in having a country
467,LIFE OF LOWELL,"to love."" On July 21 a solemn service was held at Harvard College in"
468,LIFE OF LOWELL,"memory of her sons who had died in the war, in which Lowell gave the"
469,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Commemoration Ode_, a poem which is now regarded, not as popular, but"
470,LIFE OF LOWELL,as marking the highest reach of his poetic power. The famous passage
471,LIFE OF LOWELL,characterizing Lincoln is unquestionably the finest tribute ever paid
472,LIFE OF LOWELL,to Lincoln by an American author.
473,LIFE OF LOWELL,
474,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In the presidential campaign of 1876 Lowell was active, making"
475,LIFE OF LOWELL,"speeches, serving as delegate to the Republican Convention, and later"
476,LIFE OF LOWELL,as Presidential Elector. There was even much talk of sending him to
477,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Congress. Through the friendly offices of Mr. Howells, who was in"
478,LIFE OF LOWELL,"intimate personal relations with President Hayes, he was appointed"
479,LIFE OF LOWELL,Minister to Spain. This honor was the more gratifying to him because
480,LIFE OF LOWELL,"he had long been devoted to the Spanish literature and language, and"
481,LIFE OF LOWELL,he could now read his beloved Calderon with new joys. In 1880 he was
482,LIFE OF LOWELL,"promoted to the English mission, and during the next four years"
483,LIFE OF LOWELL,represented his country at the Court of St. James in a manner that
484,LIFE OF LOWELL,raised him to the highest point of honor and esteem in both nations.
485,LIFE OF LOWELL,"His career in England was an extraordinary, in most respects an"
486,LIFE OF LOWELL,unparalleled success. He was our first official representative to win
487,LIFE OF LOWELL,"completely the heart of the English people, and a great part of his"
488,LIFE OF LOWELL,permanent achievement was to establish more cordial relations between
489,LIFE OF LOWELL,the two countries. His literary reputation had prepared the ground
490,LIFE OF LOWELL,"for his personal popularity. He was greeted as ""His Excellency the"
491,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Ambassador of American Literature to the Court of Shakespeare."" His"
492,LIFE OF LOWELL,fascinating personality won friends in every circle of society. Queen
493,LIFE OF LOWELL,Victoria declared that during her long reign no ambassador had created
494,LIFE OF LOWELL,so much interest or won so much regard. He had already been honored by
495,LIFE OF LOWELL,"degrees from Oxford and Cambridge, and now many similar honors were"
496,LIFE OF LOWELL,thrust upon him. He was acknowledged to be the best after-dinner
497,LIFE OF LOWELL,"speaker in England, and no one was called upon so often for addresses"
498,LIFE OF LOWELL,"at dedications, the unveiling of tablets, and other civic occasions."
499,LIFE OF LOWELL,It is not strange that he became attached to England with an
500,LIFE OF LOWELL,"increasing affection, but there was no diminution of his intense"
501,LIFE OF LOWELL,Americanism. His celebrated Birmingham address on _Democracy_ is yet
502,LIFE OF LOWELL,our clearest and noblest exposition of American political principles
503,LIFE OF LOWELL,and ideals.
504,LIFE OF LOWELL,
505,LIFE OF LOWELL,With the inauguration of Cleveland in 1885 Lowell's official residence
506,LIFE OF LOWELL,in England came to an end. He returned to America and for a time lived
507,LIFE OF LOWELL,"with his daughter at Deerfoot Farm. Mrs. Lowell had died in England,"
508,LIFE OF LOWELL,and he could not carry his sorrow back to Elmwood alone. He now
509,LIFE OF LOWELL,"leisurely occupied himself with literary work, making an occasional"
510,LIFE OF LOWELL,"address upon literature or politics, which was always distinguished by"
511,LIFE OF LOWELL,grace and dignity of style and richness of thought.
512,LIFE OF LOWELL,
513,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In November, 1886, he delivered the oration at the 250th anniversary"
514,LIFE OF LOWELL,"of the founding of Harvard University, and, rising to the requirements"
515,LIFE OF LOWELL,"of this notable occasion, he captivated his hearers, among whom were"
516,LIFE OF LOWELL,many distinguished delegates from the great universities of Europe as
517,LIFE OF LOWELL,"well as of America, by the power of his thought and the felicity of"
518,LIFE OF LOWELL,his expression.
519,LIFE OF LOWELL,
520,LIFE OF LOWELL,During the period of his diplomatic service he added almost nothing to
521,LIFE OF LOWELL,his permanent literary product. In 1869 he had published _Under the
522,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Willows_, a collection that contains some of his finest poems. In the"
523,LIFE OF LOWELL,"same year _The Cathedral_ was published, a stately poem in blank"
524,LIFE OF LOWELL,"verse, profound in thought, with many passages of great poetic beauty."
525,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In 1888 a final collection of poems was published, entitled"
526,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Heartsease and Rue_, which opened with the memorial poem, _Agassiz_,"
527,LIFE OF LOWELL,an elegy that would not be too highly honored by being bound in a
528,LIFE OF LOWELL,"golden volume with _Lycidas_, _Adonais_ and _Thyrsis_. Going back to"
529,LIFE OF LOWELL,"his earliest literary studies, he again (1887) lectured at the Lowell"
530,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Institute on the old dramatists, Occasionally he gave a poem to the"
531,LIFE OF LOWELL,magazines and a collection of these _Last Poems_ was made in 1895 by
532,LIFE OF LOWELL,Professor Norton. During these years were written many of the charming
533,LIFE OF LOWELL,"_Letters_ to personal friends, which rank with the finest literary"
534,LIFE OF LOWELL,letters ever printed and must always be regarded as an important part
535,LIFE OF LOWELL,of his prose works.
536,LIFE OF LOWELL,
537,LIFE OF LOWELL,It was a gracious boon of providence that Lowell was permitted to
538,LIFE OF LOWELL,"spend his last years at Elmwood, with his daughter, Mrs. Burnett, and"
539,LIFE OF LOWELL,"his grandchildren. There again, as in the early days, he watched the"
540,LIFE OF LOWELL,orioles building their nests and listened to the tricksy catbird's
541,LIFE OF LOWELL,"call. To an English friend he writes: ""I watch the moon rise behind"
542,LIFE OF LOWELL,the same trees through which I first saw it seventy years ago and have
543,LIFE OF LOWELL,"a strange feeling of permanence, as if I should watch it seventy years"
544,LIFE OF LOWELL,"longer."" In the old library by the familiar fireplace he sat, when the"
545,LIFE OF LOWELL,"shadows were playing among his beloved books, communing with the"
546,LIFE OF LOWELL,beautiful past. What unwritten poems of pathos and sweetness may have
547,LIFE OF LOWELL,ministered to his great soul we cannot know. In 1890 a fatal disease
548,LIFE OF LOWELL,"came upon him, and after long and heroic endurance of pain he died,"
549,LIFE OF LOWELL,"August 12, 1891, and under the trees of Mt. Auburn he rests, as in"
550,LIFE OF LOWELL,life still near his great neighbor Longfellow. In a memorial poem
551,LIFE OF LOWELL,Oliver Wendell Holmes spoke for the thousands who mourned:
552,LIFE OF LOWELL,
553,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""Peace to thy slumber in the forest shade,"
554,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Poet and patriot, every gift was thine;"
555,LIFE OF LOWELL,Thy name shall live while summers bloom and fade
556,LIFE OF LOWELL,"And grateful memory guard thy leafy shrine."""
557,LIFE OF LOWELL,
558,LIFE OF LOWELL,Lowell's rich and varied personality presents a type of cultured
559,LIFE OF LOWELL,manhood that is the finest product of American democracy. The
560,LIFE OF LOWELL,largeness of his interests and the versatility of his intellectual
561,LIFE OF LOWELL,powers give him a unique eminence among American authors. His genius
562,LIFE OF LOWELL,was undoubtedly embarrassed by the diffusive tendency of his
563,LIFE OF LOWELL,interests. He might have been a greater poet had he been less the
564,LIFE OF LOWELL,"reformer and statesman, and his creative impulses were often absorbed"
565,LIFE OF LOWELL,in the mere enjoyment of exercising his critical faculty. Although he
566,LIFE OF LOWELL,"achieved only a qualified eminence as poet, or as prose writer, yet"
567,LIFE OF LOWELL,because of the breadth and variety of his permanent achievement he
568,LIFE OF LOWELL,must be regarded as our greatest man of letters. His sympathetic
569,LIFE OF LOWELL,"interest, always outflowing toward concrete humanity, was a quality--"
570,LIFE OF LOWELL,
571,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""With such large range as from the ale-house bench"
572,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Can reach the stars and be with both at home."""
573,LIFE OF LOWELL,
574,LIFE OF LOWELL,With marvelous versatility and equal ease he could talk with the
575,LIFE OF LOWELL,down-east farmer and salty seamen and exchange elegant compliments
576,LIFE OF LOWELL,with old world royalty. In _The Cathedral_ he says significantly:
577,LIFE OF LOWELL,
578,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""I thank benignant nature most for this,--"
579,LIFE OF LOWELL,"A force of sympathy, or call it lack"
580,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Of character firm-planted, loosing me"
581,LIFE OF LOWELL,From the pent chamber of habitual self
582,LIFE OF LOWELL,"To dwell enlarged in alien modes of thought,"
583,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Haply distasteful, wholesomer for that,"
584,LIFE OF LOWELL,"And through imagination to possess,"
585,LIFE OF LOWELL,"As they were mine, the lives of other men."""
586,LIFE OF LOWELL,
587,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In the delightful little poem, _The Nightingale in the Study_, we have"
588,LIFE OF LOWELL,a fanciful expression of the conflict between Lowell's love of books
589,LIFE OF LOWELL,"and love of nature. His friend the catbird calls him ""out beneath the"
590,LIFE OF LOWELL,"unmastered sky,"" where the buttercups ""brim with wine beyond all"
591,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Lesbian juice."" But there are ampler skies, he answers, ""in Fancy's"
592,LIFE OF LOWELL,"land,"" and the singers though dead so long--"
593,LIFE OF LOWELL,
594,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""Give its best sweetness to all song."
595,LIFE OF LOWELL,"To nature's self her better glory."""
596,LIFE OF LOWELL,
597,LIFE OF LOWELL,"His love of reading is manifest in all his work, giving to his style a"
598,LIFE OF LOWELL,bookishness that is sometimes excessive and often troublesome. His
599,LIFE OF LOWELL,"expression, though generally direct and clear, and happily colored by"
600,LIFE OF LOWELL,"personal frankness, is often burdened with learning. To be able to"
601,LIFE OF LOWELL,read his essays with full appreciation is in itself evidence of a
602,LIFE OF LOWELL,"liberal education. His scholarship was broad and profound, but it was"
603,LIFE OF LOWELL,"not scholarship in the German sense, exhaustive and exhausting. He"
604,LIFE OF LOWELL,"studied for the joy of knowing, never for the purpose of being known,"
605,LIFE OF LOWELL,and he cared more to know the spirit and meaning of things than to
606,LIFE OF LOWELL,know their causes and origins. A language he learned for the sake of
607,LIFE OF LOWELL,"its literature rather than its philology. As Mr. Brownell observes, he"
608,LIFE OF LOWELL,shows little interest in the large movements of the world's history.
609,LIFE OF LOWELL,He seemed to prefer history as sublimated in the poet's song. The
610,LIFE OF LOWELL,field of _belles-lettres_ was his native province; its atmosphere was
611,LIFE OF LOWELL,most congenial to his tastes. In book-land it was always June for
612,LIFE OF LOWELL,him--
613,LIFE OF LOWELL,
614,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""Springtime ne'er denied"
615,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Indoors by vernal Chaucer, whose fresh woods"
616,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Throb thick with merle and mavis all the year."""
617,LIFE OF LOWELL,
618,LIFE OF LOWELL,But books could never divert his soul from its early endearments with
619,LIFE OF LOWELL,"out-of-door nature. ""The older I grow,"" he says, ""the more I am"
620,LIFE OF LOWELL,convinced that there are no satisfactions so deep and so permanent as
621,LIFE OF LOWELL,"our sympathies with outward nature."" And in the preface to _My Study"
622,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Windows_ he speaks of himself as ""one who has always found his most"
623,LIFE OF LOWELL,"fruitful study in the open air."" The most charming element of his"
624,LIFE OF LOWELL,poetry is the nature element that everywhere cheers and stimulates the
625,LIFE OF LOWELL,"reader. It is full of sunshine and bird music. So genuine, spontaneous"
626,LIFE OF LOWELL,and sympathetic are his descriptions that we feel the very heart
627,LIFE OF LOWELL,"throbs of nature in his verse, and in the prose of such records of"
628,LIFE OF LOWELL,"intimacies with outdoor friends as the essay, _My Garden"
629,LIFE OF LOWELL,"Acquaintance_. ""How I do love the earth,"" he exclaims. ""I feel it"
630,LIFE OF LOWELL,thrill under my feet. I feel somehow as if it were conscious of my
631,LIFE OF LOWELL,"love, as if something passed into my dancing blood from it."" It is"
632,LIFE OF LOWELL,this sensitive nearness to nature that makes him a better interpreter
633,LIFE OF LOWELL,"of her ""visible forms"" than Bryant even; moreover, unlike Bryant he"
634,LIFE OF LOWELL,always catches the notes of joy in nature's voices and feels the
635,LIFE OF LOWELL,uplift of a happy inspiration.
636,LIFE OF LOWELL,
637,LIFE OF LOWELL,"In the presence of the immense popularity of Mark Twain, it may seem"
638,LIFE OF LOWELL,paradoxical to call Lowell our greatest American humorist. Yet in the
639,LIFE OF LOWELL,refined and artistic qualities of humorous writing and in the
640,LIFE OF LOWELL,genuineness of the native flavor his work is certainly superior to any
641,LIFE OF LOWELL,other humorous writing that is likely to compete with it for permanent
642,LIFE OF LOWELL,"interest. Indeed, Mr. Greenslet thinks that ""it is as the author of"
643,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the _Biglow Papers_ that he is likely to be longest remembered."" The"
644,LIFE OF LOWELL,"perpetual play of humor gave to his work, even to the last, the"
645,LIFE OF LOWELL,freshness of youth. We love him for his boyish love of pure fun. The
646,LIFE OF LOWELL,two large volumes of his _Letters_ are delicious reading because he
647,LIFE OF LOWELL,"put into them ""good wholesome nonsense,"" as he says, ""keeping my"
648,LIFE OF LOWELL,"seriousness to bore myself with."""
649,LIFE OF LOWELL,
650,LIFE OF LOWELL,But this sparkling and overflowing humor never obscures the deep
651,LIFE OF LOWELL,seriousness that is the undercurrent of all his writing. A high
652,LIFE OF LOWELL,idealism characterizes all his work. One of his greatest services to
653,LIFE OF LOWELL,his country was the effort to create a saner and sounder political
654,LIFE OF LOWELL,"life. As he himself realized, he often moralized his work too much"
655,LIFE OF LOWELL,"with a purposeful idealism. In middle life he said, ""I shall never be"
656,LIFE OF LOWELL,"a poet until I get out of the pulpit, and New England was all"
657,LIFE OF LOWELL,"meeting-house when I was growing up."" In religion and philosophy he"
658,LIFE OF LOWELL,"was conservative, deprecating the radical and scientific tendencies of"
659,LIFE OF LOWELL,"the age, with its knife and glass--"
660,LIFE OF LOWELL,
661,LIFE OF LOWELL,"""That make thought physical and thrust far off"
662,LIFE OF LOWELL,"The Heaven, so neighborly with man of old,"""
663,LIFE OF LOWELL,
664,LIFE OF LOWELL,"The moral impulse and the poetic impulse were often in conflict, and"
665,LIFE OF LOWELL,much of his early poetry for this reason was condemned by his later
666,LIFE OF LOWELL,"judgment. His maturer poems are filled with deep-thoughted lines,"
667,LIFE OF LOWELL,phrases of high aspiration and soul-stirring ecstasies. Though his
668,LIFE OF LOWELL,"thought is spiritual and ideal, it is always firmly rooted in the"
669,LIFE OF LOWELL,experience of common humanity. All can climb the heights with him and
670,LIFE OF LOWELL,catch inspiring glimpses at least of the ideal and the infinite.

678,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"""The proportion of his poetry that can be so called is small. But a"
679,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"great deal of it is very fine, very noble, and at times very"
680,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"beautiful, and it discloses the distinctly poetic faculty of which"
681,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,rhythmic and figurative is native expression. It is impressionable
682,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,rather than imaginative in the large sense; it is felicitous in detail
683,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"rather than in design; and of a general rather than individual, a"
684,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"representative rather than original, inspiration. There is a field of"
685,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"poetry, assuredly not the highest, but ample and admirable--in which"
686,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"these qualities, more or less unsatisfactory in prose, are"
687,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,legitimately and fruitfully exercised. All poetry is in the realm of
688,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"feeling, and thus less exclusively dependent on the thought that is"
689,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"the sole reliance of prose. Being genuine poetry, Lowell's profits by"
690,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"this advantage. Feeling is fitly, genuinely, its inspiration. Its"
691,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,range and limitations correspond to the character of his
692,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"susceptibility, as those of his prose do to that of his thought. The"
693,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,fusion of the two in the crucible of the imagination is infrequent
694,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"with him, because with him it is the fancy rather than the imagination"
695,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,that is luxuriant and highly developed. For the architectonics of
696,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"poetry he had not the requisite reach and grasp, the comprehensive and"
697,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,constructing vision. Nothing of his has any large design or effective
698,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,interdependent proportions. In a technical way an exception should be
699,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,noted in his skilful building of the ode--a form in which he was
700,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,extremely successful and for which he evidently had a native aptitude
701,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"... Lowell's constitutes, on the whole, the most admirable American"
702,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,contribution to the nature poetry of English literature--far beyond
703,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"that of Bryant, Whittier, or Longfellow, I think, and only"

738,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,function of such a poet--that of stimulating to a noble height the
739,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,national instincts of his countrymen.... The rest of his poetry may
740,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,fairly be said to gain on that of any of his American contemporaries
741,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"save Poe in more sensuous rhythm, in choicer diction, in a more"

747,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"""In originality, in virility, in many-sidedness, Lowell is the first"
748,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"of American poets. He not only possessed, at times in nearly equal"
749,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"measure, many of the qualities most notable in his fellow-poets,"
750,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"rivaling Bryant as a painter of nature, and Holmes in pathos, having"
751,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"a touch too of Emerson's transcendentalism, and rising occasionally to"
752,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"Whittier's moral fervor, but he brought to all this much beside. In"
753,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,one vein he produced such a masterpiece of mingled pathos and nature
754,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,painting as we find in the tenth Biglow letter of the second series;
755,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"in another, such a lyric gem as _The Fountain_; in another, _The First"
756,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"Snow-Fall_ and _After the Burial_; in another, again, the noble"
757,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,_Harvard Commemoration Ode_.... He had plainly a most defective ear
758,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,for rhythm and verbal harmony. Except when he confines himself to
759,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"simple metres, we rarely find five consecutive lines which do _not_ in"
760,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"some way jar on us. His blank verse and the irregular metres which he,"
761,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"unfortunately, so often employs, have little or no music, and are"
762,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,often quite intolerable. But after all the deductions which the most
763,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"exacting criticism can make, it still remains that, as a serious poet"
764,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"Lowell stands high. As a painter of nature, he has, when at his best,"
765,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"few superiors, and, in his own country, none. Whatever be their"
766,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"esthetic and technical deficiencies, he has written many poems of"
767,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,sentiment and pathos which can never fail to come home to all to whom
768,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"such poetry appeals. His hortatory and didactic poetry, as it"
769,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"expresses itself in the _Commemoration Ode_, is worthy, if not of the"
770,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"music and felicity of Milton and Wordsworth, at least of their tone,"
771,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,when that tone is most exalted. As a humorist he is inimitable. His
772,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"humor is rooted in a fine sense of the becoming, and in a profounder"
773,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,insight into the character of his countrymen than that of any other

780,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"scholar of wide learning, deep also when his interest was most"

782,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"passionately pure; but first, last, and always he was a poet, never"
783,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,so happy as when he was looking at the world from the poet's mount of
784,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,vision and seeking for fit words and musical to tell what he had seen.
785,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,But his emotion was not sufficiently 'recollected in tranquillity.'
786,CRITICAL APPRECIATIONS,"Had he been more an artist he would have been a better poet, for then"

803,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
804,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Early in 1848 in a letter to his friend Briggs, Lowell speaks of _The"
805,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Vision of Sir Launfal_ as ""a sort of story, and more likely to be"
806,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"popular than what I write generally. Maria thinks very highly of it."""
807,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"And in another letter he calls it ""a little narrative poem."" In"
808,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"December, 1848, it was published in a thin volume alone, and at once"
809,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,justified the poet's expectations of popularity. The poem was an
810,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"improvisation, like that of his ""musing organist,"" for it was written,"
811,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"we are told, almost at a single sitting, entirely within two days. The"
812,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"theme may have been suggested by Tennyson's _Sir Galahad_, but his"
813,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,familiarity with the old romances and his love of the mystical and
814,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,symbolic sense of these good old-time tales were a quite ample source
815,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,for such suggestion. Moreover Lowell in his early years was much given
816,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"to seeing visions and dreaming dreams. ""During that part of my life,"""
817,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"he says, ""which I lived most alone, I was never a single night"
818,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"unvisited by visions, and once I thought I had a personal revelation"
819,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"from God Himself."" The _Fairie Queen_ was ""the first poem I ever"
820,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"read,"" he says, and the bosky glades of Elmwood were often transformed"
821,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"into an enchanted forest where the Knight of the Red Cross, and Una"
822,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,and others in medieval costume passed up and down before his wondering
823,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,eyes. This medieval romanticism was a perfectly natural accompaniment
824,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,of his intense idealism.
825,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
826,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"_The Vision of Sir Launfal_ and the _Fable for Critics_, published in"
827,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the same year, illustrate the two dominant and strikingly contrasted"
828,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"qualities of his nature, a contrast of opposites which he himself"
829,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"clearly perceived. ""I find myself very curiously compounded of two"
830,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,utterly distinct characters. One half of me is clear mystic and
831,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"enthusiast, and the other, humorist,"" and he adds that ""it would have"
832,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"taken very little to have made a Saint Francis"" of him. It was the"
833,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Saint Francis of New England, the moral and spiritual enthusiast in"
834,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,Lowell's nature that produced the poem and gave it power. Thus we see
835,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"that notwithstanding its antique style and artificial structure, it"
836,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,was a perfectly direct and spontaneous expression of himself.
837,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
838,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"The allegory of the _Vision_ is easily interpreted, in its main"
839,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"significance. There is nothing original in the lesson, the humility of"
840,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"true charity, and it is a common criticism that the moral purpose of"
841,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,the poem is lost sight of in the beautiful nature pictures. But a
842,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,knowledge of the events which were commanding Lowell's attention at
843,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,this time and quickening his native feelings into purposeful utterance
844,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"gives to the poem a much deeper significance. In 1844, when the"
845,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"discussion over the annexation of Texas was going on, he wrote _The"
846,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Present Crisis_, a noble appeal to his countrymen to improve and"
847,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,elevate their principles. During the next four years he was writing
848,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"editorially for the _Standard_, the official organ of the Anti-Slavery"
849,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Society, at the same time he was bringing out the _Biglow Papers_. In"
850,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,all these forms of expression he voiced constantly the sentiment of
851,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"reform, which now filled his heart like a holy zeal. The national"
852,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,disgrace of slavery rested heavily upon his soul. He burned with the
853,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,desire to make God's justice prevail where man's justice had failed.
854,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"In 1846 he said in a letter, ""It seems as if my heart would break in"
855,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"pouring out one glorious song that should be the gospel of Reform,"
856,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"full of consolation and strength to the oppressed, yet falling gently"
857,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,and restoringly as dew on the withered youth-flowers of the oppressor.
858,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"That way my madness lies, if any."" This passionate yearning for reform"
859,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"is embodied poetically in the _Vision_. In a broad sense, therefore,"
860,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the poem is an expression of ideal democracy, in which equality,"
861,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"sympathy, and a sense of the common brotherhood of man are the basis"
862,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,of all ethical actions and standards. It is the Christ-like conception
863,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,of human society that is always so alluring in the poetry and so
864,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,discouraging in the prose of life.
865,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
866,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,The following explanation appeared in the early editions of the poem
867,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,as an introductory note:
868,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
869,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""According to the mythology of the Romancers, the San Greal,"
870,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"or Holy Grail, was the cup out of which Jesus Christ partook"
871,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,of the last supper with his disciples. It was brought into
872,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"England by Joseph of Arimathea, and remained there, an"
873,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"object of pilgrimage and adoration, for many years in the"
874,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,keeping of his lineal descendants. It was incumbent upon
875,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"those who had charge of it to be chaste in thought, word,"
876,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"and deed; but, one of the keepers having broken this"
877,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"condition, the Holy Grail disappeared. From that time it was"
878,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,a favorite enterprise of the Knights of Arthur's court to go
879,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,in search of it. Sir Galahad was at last successful in
880,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"finding it, as may be read in the seventeenth book of the"
881,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,Romance of King Arthur. Tennyson has made Sir Galahad the
882,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,subject of one of the most exquisite of his poems.
883,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
884,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""The plot (if I may give that name to anything so slight) of"
885,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the following poem is my own, and, to serve its purposes, I"
886,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,have enlarged the circle of competition in search of the
887,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,miraculous cup in such a manner as to include not only other
888,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"persons than the heroes of the Round Table, but also a"
889,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,period of time subsequent to the date of King Arthur's
890,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"reign."""
891,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
892,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,In the last sentence there is a sly suggestion of Lowell's
893,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,playfulness. Of course every one may compete in the search for the
894,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Grail, and the ""time subsequent to King Arthur's reign"" includes the"
895,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,present time. The Romance of King Arthur is the _Morte Darthur_ of Sir
896,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,Thomas Malory. Lowell's specific indebtedness to the medieval romances
897,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,extended only to the use of the symbol of consecration to some noble
898,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"purpose in the search for the Grail, and to the name of his hero. It"
899,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,is a free version of older French romances belonging to the Arthurian
900,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,cycle. _Sir Launfal_ is the title of a poem written by Sir Thomas
901,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Chestre in the reign of Henry VI, which may be found in Ritson's"
902,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,_Ancient English Metrical Romances_. There is nothing suggestive of
903,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Lowell's poem except the quality of generosity in the hero, who--"

906,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Gold and sylver; and clodes ryche,"
907,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"To squyer and to knight."""
908,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
909,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"One of Lowell's earlier poems, _The Search_, contains the germ of _The"
910,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Vision of Sir Launfal_. It represents a search for Christ, first in"
911,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"nature's fair woods and fields, then in the ""proud world"" amid ""power"
912,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"and wealth,"" and the search finally ends in ""a hovel rude"" where--"
913,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
914,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""The King I sought for meekly stood:"
915,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"A naked, hungry child"
916,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Clung round his gracious knee,"
917,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,And a poor hunted slave looked up and smiled
918,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"To bless the smile that set him free."""
919,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
920,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"And Christ, the seeker learns, is not to be found by wandering through"
921,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,the world.
922,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
923,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""His throne is with the outcast and the weak."""
924,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
925,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,A similar fancy also is embodied in a little poem entitled _A
926,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Parable_. Christ goes through the world to see ""How the men, my"
927,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"brethren, believe in me,"" and he finds ""in church, and palace, and"
928,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"judgment-hall,"" a disregard for the primary principles of his"
929,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,teaching.
930,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
931,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""Have ye founded your throne and altars, then,"
932,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,On the bodies and souls of living men?
933,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"And think ye that building shall endure,"
934,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Which shelters the noble and crushes the poor?"""
935,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
936,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,These early poems and passages in others written at about the same
937,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"time, taken in connection with the _Vision_, show how strongly the"
938,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,theme had seized upon Lowell's mind.
939,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
940,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,The structure of the poem is complicated and sometimes confusing. At
941,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,the outset the student must notice that there is a story within a
942,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"story. The action of the major story covers only a single night, and"
943,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the hero of this story is the real Sir Launfal, who in his sleep"
944,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"dreams the minor story, the Vision. The action of this story covers"
945,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the lifetime of the hero, the imaginary Sir Launfal, from early"
946,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"manhood to old age, and includes his wanderings in distant lands. The"
947,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,poem is constructed on the principles of contrast and parallelism. By
948,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,holding to this method of structure throughout Lowell sacrificed the
949,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"important artistic element of unity, especially in breaking the"
950,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,narrative with the Prelude to the second part. The first Prelude
951,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"describing the beauty and inspiring joy of spring, typifying the"
952,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"buoyant youth and aspiring soul of Sir Launfal, corresponds to the"
953,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"second Prelude, describing the bleakness and desolation of winter,"
954,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,typifying the old age and desolated life of the hero. But beneath the
955,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"surface of this wintry age there is a new soul of summer beauty, the"
956,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"warm love of suffering humanity, just as beneath the surface of the"
957,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,frozen brook there is an ice-palace of summer beauty. In Part First
958,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,the gloomy castle with its joyless interior stands as the only cold
959,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"and forbidding thing in the landscape, ""like an outpost of winter;"" so"
960,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,in Part Second the same castle with Christmas joys within is the only
961,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,bright and gladsome object in the landscape. In Part First the castle
962,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"gates never ""might opened be""; in Part Second the ""castle gates stand"
963,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"open now."" And thus the student may find various details contrasted"
964,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"and paralleled. The symbolic meaning must be kept constantly in mind,"
965,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"or it will escape unobserved; for example, the cost of earthly things"
966,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,in comparison with the generosity of June corresponds to the churlish
967,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,castle opposed to the inviting warmth of summer; and each symbolizes
968,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the proud, selfish, misguided heart of Sir Launfal in youth, in"
969,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,comparison with the humility and large Christian charity in old age.
970,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"The student should search for these symbolic hints, passages in which"
971,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""more is meant than meets the ear,"" but if he does not find all that"
972,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the poet may or may not have intended in his dreamy design, there need"
973,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,be no detraction from the enjoyment of the poem.
974,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
975,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,Critical judgment upon _The Vision of Sir Launfal_ is generally severe
976,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,in respect to its structural faults. Mr. Greenslet declares that
977,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"""through half a century, nine readers out of ten have mistaken"
978,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Lowell's meaning,"" even the ""numerous commentators"" have ""interpreted"
979,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,the poem as if the young knight actually adventured the quest and
980,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"returned from it at the end of years, broken and old."" This, however,"
981,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,must be regarded as a rather exaggerated estimate of the lack of unity
982,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"and consistency in the poem. Stedman says: ""I think that _The Vision"
983,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,of Sir Launfal_ owed its success quite as much to a presentation of
984,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"nature as to its misty legend. It really is a landscape poem, of which"
985,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the lovely passage, 'And what is so rare as a day in June?' and the"
986,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"wintry prelude to Part Second, are the specific features."" And the"
987,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"English critic, J. Churton Collins, thinks that ""_Sir Launfal_, except"
988,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"for the beautiful nature pictures, scarcely rises above the level of"
989,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"an Ingoldsby Legend."""
990,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
991,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,The popular judgment of the poem (which after all is the important
992,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"judgment) is fairly stated by Mr. Greenslet: ""There is probably no"
993,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,poem in American literature in which a visionary faculty like that [of
994,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,Lowell] is expressed with such a firm command of poetic background and
995,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,variety of music as in _Sir Launfal_ ... its structure is far from
996,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,perfect; yet for all that it has stood the searching test of time: it
997,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"is beloved now by thousands of young American readers, for whom it has"
998,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"been a first initiation to the beauty of poetic idealism."""
999,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,
1000,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,While studying _The Vision of Sir Launfal_ the student should be made
1001,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"familiar with Tennyson's _Sir Galahad_ and _The Holy Grail_, and the"
1002,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,libretto of Wagner's _Parsifal_. Also Henry A. Abbey's magnificent
1003,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"series of mural paintings in the Boston Public Library, representing"
1004,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"the Quest of the Holy Grail, may be utilized in the _Copley Prints_."
1005,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,If possible the story of Sir Galahad's search for the Grail in the
1006,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,seventeenth book of Sir Thomas Malory's _Morte Darthur_ should be
1007,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,read. It would be well also to read Longfellow's _King Robert of
1008,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,"Sicily_, which to some extent presents a likeness of motive and"
1009,THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL,treatment.

1018,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,July 21 Harvard College held a solemn service in commemoration of her
1019,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,ninety-three sons who had been killed in the war. Eight of these
1020,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,fallen young heroes were of Lowell's own kindred. Personal grief thus
1021,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,added intensity to the deep passion of his utterance upon this great
1022,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"occasion. He was invited to give a poem, and the ode which he"
1023,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,presented proved to be the supreme event of the noble service. The
1024,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"scene is thus described by Francis H. Underwood, who was in the"

1026,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1027,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"""The services took place in the open air, in the presence of a great"

1029,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"hero of Gettysburg, and Major-General Devens. The wounds of the war"
1030,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"were still fresh and bleeding, and the interest of the occasion was"
1031,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,deep and thrilling. The summer afternoon was drawing to its close when
1032,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,the poet began the recital of the ode. No living audience could for
1033,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,the first time follow with intelligent appreciation the delivery of
1034,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"such a poem. To be sure, it had its obvious strong points and its"
1035,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"sonorous charms; but, like all the later poems of the author, it is"
1036,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,full of condensed thought and requires study. The reader to-day finds

1038,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,but the effect of the poem at the time was overpowering. The face of
1039,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the poet, always singularly expressive, was on this occasion almost"
1040,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"transfigured--glowing, as if with an inward light. It was impossible"
1041,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,to look away from it. Our age has furnished many great historic
1042,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"scenes, but this Commemoration combined the elements of grandeur and"
1043,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"pathos, and produced an impression as lasting as life."""
1044,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1045,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,Of the delivery and immediate effect of the poem Mr. Greenslet says:
1046,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"""Some in the audience were thrilled and shaken by it, as Lowell"
1047,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"himself was shaken in its delivery, yet he seems to have felt with"
1048,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,some reason that it was not a complete and immediate success. Nor is
1049,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"this cause for wonder. The passion of the poem was too ideal, its"
1050,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,woven harmonies too subtle to be readily communicated to so large an
1051,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"audience, mastered and mellowed though it was by a single deep mood."
1052,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,Nor was Lowell's elocution quite that of the deep-mouthed odist
1053,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,capable of interpreting such organ tones of verse. But no sooner was
1054,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the poem published, with the matchless Lincoln strophe inserted, than"
1055,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"its greatness and nobility were manifest."""
1056,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1057,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,The circumstances connected with the writing of the ode have been
1058,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,described by Lowell in his private letters. It appears that he was
1059,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"reluctant to undertake the task, and for several weeks his mind"
1060,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,utterly refused to respond to the high duty put upon it. At last the
1061,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"sublime thought came to him upon the swift wings of inspiration. ""The"
1062,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"ode itself,"" he says, ""was an improvisation. Two days before the"
1063,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,commemoration I had told my friend Child that it was impossible--that
1064,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"I was dull as a door-mat. But the next day something gave me a jog,"
1065,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,and the whole thing came out of me with a rush. I sat up all night
1066,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"writing it out clear, and took it on the morning of the day to Child."""
1067,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"In another letter he says: ""The poem was written with a vehement"
1068,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"speed, which I thought I had lost in the skirts of my professor's"
1069,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"gown. Till within two days of the celebration I was hopelessly dumb,"
1070,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"and then it all came with a rush, literally making me lean (mi fece"
1071,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"magro), and so nervous that I was weeks in getting over it."" In a note"
1072,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"in Scudder's biography of Lowell (Vol. II., p. 65), it is stated upon"
1073,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,the authority of Mrs. Lowell that the poem was begun at ten o'clock
1074,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the night before the commemoration day, and finished at four o'clock"
1075,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"in the morning. ""She opened her eyes to see him standing haggard,"
1076,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,actually wasted by the stress of labor and the excitement which had
1077,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"carried him through a poem full of passion and fire, of five hundred"
1078,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"and twenty-three lines, in the space of six hours."""
1079,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1080,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,Critical estimates are essentially in accord as to the deep
1081,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"significance and permanent poetic worth of this poem. Greenslet, the"
1082,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"latest biographer of Lowell, says that the ode, ""if not his most"
1083,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"perfect, is surely his noblest and most splendid work,"" and adds:"
1084,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"""Until the dream of human brotherhood is forgotten, the echo of its"
1085,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"large music will not wholly die away."" Professor Beers declares it to"
1086,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"be, ""although uneven, one of the finest occasional poems in the"
1087,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"language, and the most important contribution which our Civil War has"
1088,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"made to song."" Of its exalted patriotism, George William Curtis says:"
1089,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"""The patriotic heart of America throbs forever in Lincoln's Gettysburg"
1090,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,address. But nowhere in literature is there a more magnificent and
1091,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,majestic personification of a country whose name is sacred to its
1092,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"children, nowhere a profounder passion of patriotic loyalty, than in"
1093,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the closing lines of the Commemoration Ode. The American whose heart,"
1094,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"swayed by that lofty music, does not thrill and palpitate with solemn"
1095,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"joy and high resolve does not yet know what it is to be an American."""
1096,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1097,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,With the praise of a discriminating criticism Stedman discusses the
1098,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"ode in his _Poets of America_: ""Another poet would have composed a"
1099,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,less unequal ode; no American could have glorified it with braver
1100,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"passages, with whiter heat, with language and imagery so befitting"
1101,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,impassioned thought. Tried by the rule that a true poet is at his best
1102,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"with the greatest theme, Lowell's strength is indisputable. The ode is"
1103,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"no smooth-cut verse from Pentelicus, but a mass of rugged quartz,"
1104,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"beautiful with prismatic crystals, and deep veined here and there with"
1105,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"virgin gold. The early strophes, though opening with a fine abrupt"
1106,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"line, 'weak-winged is song,' are scarcely firm and incisive. Lowell"
1107,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"had to work up to his theme. In the third division, 'Many loved Truth,"
1108,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"and lavished life's best oil,' he struck upon a new and musical"
1109,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,intonation of the tenderest thoughts. The quaver of this melodious
1110,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"interlude carries the ode along, until the great strophe is reached,--"
1111,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1112,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"Such was he, our Martyr-Chief,"
1113,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1114,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"in which the man, Abraham Lincoln, whose death had but just closed the"
1115,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"national tragedy, is delineated in a manner that gives this poet a"
1116,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"preëminence, among those who capture likeness in enduring verse, that"
1117,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,we award to Velasquez among those who fasten it upon the canvas. 'One
1118,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"of Plutarch's men' is before us, face to face; an historic character"
1119,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"whom Lowell fully comprehended, and to whose height he reached in this"
1120,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"great strophe. Scarcely less fine is his tearful, yet transfiguring,"
1121,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,Avete to the sacred dead of the Commemoration. The weaker divisions of
1122,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the production furnish a background to these passages, and at the"
1123,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"close the poet rises with the invocation,--"
1124,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1125,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"'Bow down, dear Land, for thou hast found release!'"
1126,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1127,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,a strain which shows that when Lowell determinedly sets his mouth to
1128,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the trumpet, the blast is that of Roncesvalles."""
1129,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1130,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"W.C. Brownell, the latest critic of Lowell's poetry, says of this"
1131,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"poem: ""The ode is too long, its evolution is defective, it contains"
1132,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"verbiage, it preaches. But passages of it--the most famous having"
1133,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,characteristically been interpolated after its delivery--are equal to
1134,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,anything of the kind. The temptation to quote from it is hard to
1135,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"withstand. It is the cap-sheaf of Lowell's achievement."" In this ode"
1136,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"""he reaches, if he does not throughout maintain, his own"
1137,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,'clear-ethered height' and his verse has the elevation of ecstasy and
1138,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the splendor of the sublime."""
1139,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,
1140,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,The versification of this poem should be studied with some
1141,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,particularity. Of the forms of lyric expression the ode is the most
1142,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,elaborate and dignified. It is adapted only to lofty themes and
1143,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,stately occasions. Great liberty is allowed in the choice and
1144,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"arrangement of its meter, rhymes, and stanzaic forms, that its varied"
1145,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,form and movement may follow the changing phases of the sentiment and
1146,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,passion called forth by the theme. Lowell has given us an account of
1147,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"his own consideration of this matter. ""My problem,"" he says, ""was to"
1148,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"contrive a measure which should not be tedious by uniformity, which"
1149,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"should vary with varying moods, in which the transitions (including"
1150,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,those of the voice) should be managed without jar. I at first thought
1151,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"of mixed rhymed and blank verses of unequal measures, like those in"
1152,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"the choruses of _Samson Agonistes_, which are in the main masterly. Of"
1153,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"course, Milton deliberately departed from that stricter form of Greek"
1154,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,chorus to which it was bound quite as much (I suspect) by the law of
1155,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,its musical accompaniment as by any sense of symmetry. I wrote some
1156,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"stanzas of the _Commemoration Ode_ on this theory at first, leaving"
1157,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,some verses without a rhyme to match. But my ear was better pleased
1158,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"when the rhyme, coming at a longer interval, as a far-off echo rather"
1159,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"than instant reverberation, produced the same effect almost, and yet"
1160,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,was gratified by unexpectedly recalling an association and faint
1161,THE COMMEMORATION ODE,"reminiscence of consonance."""

1737,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,Three times his kingly beard he smoothed.          15
1738,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,And made him viceroy o'er his sheep.
1739,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,
1740,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"His words were simple words enough,"

1743,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,In his seemed musical and low.                     20
1744,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,
1745,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"Men called him but a shiftless youth,"

1749,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,
1750,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"They knew not how he learned at all,               25"
1751,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"For, long hour after hour,"
1752,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"He sat and watched the dead leaves fall,"
1753,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,Or mused upon a common flower.
1754,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,
1755,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,It seemed the loveliness of things

1759,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,
1760,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"Men granted that his speech was wise,"

1762,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"Of his slim grace and woman's eyes,                35"
1763,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,"They laughed, and called him good-for-naught."
1764,THE SHEPHERD OF KING ADMETUS,

1795,AN INCIDENT IN A RAILROAD CAR,
1796,AN INCIDENT IN A RAILROAD CAR,It was a sight for sin and wrong
1797,AN INCIDENT IN A RAILROAD CAR,"And slavish tyranny to see,"

2071,MY LOVE,And patiently she folds her wings
2072,MY LOVE,To tread the humble paths of earth.              25
2073,MY LOVE,
2074,MY LOVE,"Blessing she is: God made her so,"
2075,MY LOVE,And deeds of week-day holiness
2076,MY LOVE,"Fall from her noiseless as the snow,"
2077,MY LOVE,Nor hath she ever chanced to know
2078,MY LOVE,That aught were easier than to bless.            30
2079,MY LOVE,
2080,MY LOVE,"She is most fair, and thereunto"
2081,MY LOVE,Her life doth rightly harmonize;
2082,MY LOVE,Feeling or thought that was not true
2083,MY LOVE,Ne'er made less beautiful the blue
2084,MY LOVE,Unclouded heaven of her eyes.                    35
2085,MY LOVE,
2086,MY LOVE,She is a woman: one in whom
2087,MY LOVE,The spring-time of her childish years
2088,MY LOVE,"Hath never lost its fresh perfume,"
2089,MY LOVE,Though knowing well that life hath room
2090,MY LOVE,For many blights and many tears.                 40
2091,MY LOVE,
2092,MY LOVE,I love her with a love as still
2093,MY LOVE,"As a broad river's peaceful might,"
2094,MY LOVE,"Which, by high tower and lowly mill,"
2095,MY LOVE,"Goes wandering at its own will,"
2096,MY LOVE,And yet doth ever flow aright.                   45
2097,MY LOVE,
2098,MY LOVE,"And, on its full, deep breast serene,"
2099,MY LOVE,Like quiet isles my duties lie;
2100,MY LOVE,"It flows around them and between,"
2101,MY LOVE,"And makes them fresh and fair and green,"
2102,MY LOVE,Sweet homes wherein to live and die.             50
2103,MY LOVE,
2104,MY LOVE,
2105,MY LOVE,
2106,MY LOVE,
2107,THE CHANGELING,THE CHANGELING
2108,THE CHANGELING,
2109,THE CHANGELING,
2110,THE CHANGELING,"I had a little daughter,"
2111,THE CHANGELING,And she was given to me
2112,THE CHANGELING,To lead me gently backward
2113,THE CHANGELING,"To the Heavenly Father's knee,"
2114,THE CHANGELING,"That I, by the force of nature,                     5"
2115,THE CHANGELING,Might in some dim wise divine
2116,THE CHANGELING,The depth of his infinite patience
2117,THE CHANGELING,To this wayward soul of mine.
2118,THE CHANGELING,
2119,THE CHANGELING,"I know not how others saw her,"
2120,THE CHANGELING,"But to me she was wholly fair,                   10"
2121,THE CHANGELING,And the light of the heaven she came from
2122,THE CHANGELING,Still lingered and gleamed in her hair;
2123,THE CHANGELING,"For it was as wavy and golden,"
2124,THE CHANGELING,"And as many changes took,"
2125,THE CHANGELING,As the shadows of sun-gilt ripples                 15
2126,THE CHANGELING,On the yellow bed of a brook.
2127,THE CHANGELING,
2128,THE CHANGELING,To what can I liken her smiling
2129,THE CHANGELING,"Upon me, her kneeling lover?"
2130,THE CHANGELING,"How it leaped from her lips to her eyelids,"
2131,THE CHANGELING,"And dimpled her wholly over,                     20"
2132,THE CHANGELING,"Till her outstretched hands smiled also,"
2133,THE CHANGELING,And I almost seemed to see
2134,THE CHANGELING,The very heart of her mother
2135,THE CHANGELING,Sending sun through her veins to me!
2136,THE CHANGELING,
2137,THE CHANGELING,"She had been with us scarce a twelve-month,        25"
2138,THE CHANGELING,"And it hardly seemed a day,"
2139,THE CHANGELING,When a troop of wandering angels
2140,THE CHANGELING,Stole my little daughter away;
2141,THE CHANGELING,Or perhaps those heavenly Zingari
2142,THE CHANGELING,"But loosed the hampering strings,                30"
2143,THE CHANGELING,"And when they had opened her cage-door,"
2144,THE CHANGELING,My little bird used her wings.
2145,THE CHANGELING,
2146,THE CHANGELING,"But they left in her stead a changeling,"
2147,THE CHANGELING,"A little angel child,"
2148,THE CHANGELING,"That seems like her bud in full blossom,           35"
2149,THE CHANGELING,And smiles as she never smiled:
2150,THE CHANGELING,"When I wake in the morning, I see it"
2151,THE CHANGELING,"Where she always used to lie,"
2152,THE CHANGELING,And I feel as weak as a violet
2153,THE CHANGELING,Alone 'neath the awful sky.                      40
2154,THE CHANGELING,
2155,THE CHANGELING,"As weak, yet as trustful also;"
2156,THE CHANGELING,For the whole year long I see
2157,THE CHANGELING,All the wonders of faithful Nature
2158,THE CHANGELING,Still worked for the love of me;
2159,THE CHANGELING,"Winds wander, and dews drip earthward,             45"
2160,THE CHANGELING,"Rain falls, suns rise and set,"
2161,THE CHANGELING,"Earth whirls, and all but to prosper"
2162,THE CHANGELING,A poor little violet.
2163,THE CHANGELING,
2164,THE CHANGELING,"This child is not mine as the first was,"
2165,THE CHANGELING,"I cannot sing it to rest,                        50"
2166,THE CHANGELING,I cannot lift it up fatherly
2167,THE CHANGELING,And bliss it upon my breast;
2168,THE CHANGELING,Yet it lies in my little one's cradle
2169,THE CHANGELING,"And sits in my little one's chair,"
2170,THE CHANGELING,And the light of the heaven she's gone to          55
2171,THE CHANGELING,Transfigures its golden hair.
2172,THE CHANGELING,

2176,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE
2177,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2178,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2179,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"What visionary tints the year puts on,"
2180,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,When falling leaves falter through motionless air
2181,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Or numbly cling and shiver to be gone!
2182,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"How shimmer the low flats and pastures bare,"
2183,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As with her nectar Hebe Autumn fills                      5
2184,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The bowl between me and those distant-hills,"
2185,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And smiles and shakes abroad her misty, tremulous hair!"
2186,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2187,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"No more the landscape holds its wealth apart,"
2188,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Making me poorer in my poverty,"
2189,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,But mingles with my senses and my heart;                 10
2190,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,My own projected spirit seems to me
2191,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In her own reverie the world to steep;
2192,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"'T is she that waves to sympathetic sleep,"
2193,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Moving, as she is moved, each field and hill and tree."
2194,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2195,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"How fuse and mix, with what unfelt degrees,              15"
2196,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Clasped by the faint horizon's languid arms,"
2197,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Each into each, the hazy distances!"
2198,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The softened season all the landscape charms;
2199,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Those hills, my native village that embay,"
2200,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In waves of dreamier purple roll away,                   20"
2201,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And floating in mirage seem all the glimmering farms.
2202,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2203,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Far distant sounds the hidden chickadee
2204,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Close at my side; far distant sound the leaves;
2205,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The fields seem fields of dream, where Memory"
2206,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Wanders like gleaning Ruth; and as the sheaves             25
2207,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Of wheat and barley wavered in the eye
2208,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of Boaz as the maiden's glow went by,"
2209,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,So tremble and seem remote all things the sense receives.
2210,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2211,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The cock's shrill trump that tells of scattered corn,"
2212,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Passed breezily on by all his flapping mates,              30"
2213,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Faint and more faint, from barn to barn is borne,"
2214,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Southward, perhaps to far Magellan's Straits;"
2215,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dimly I catch the throb of distant flails;
2216,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Silently overhead the hen-hawk sails,"
2217,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With watchful, measuring eye, and for his quarry waits.      35"
2218,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2219,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The sobered robin, hunger-silent now,"
2220,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Seeks cedar-berries blue, his autumn cheer;"
2221,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The chipmunk, on the shingly shagbark's bough,"
2222,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now saws, now lists with downward eye and ear,"
2223,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then drops his nut, and, cheeping, with a bound          40"
2224,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Whisks to his winding fastness underground;
2225,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The clouds like swans drift down the streaming atmosphere.
2226,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2227,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er yon bare knoll the pointed cedar shadows
2228,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Drowse on the crisp, gray moss; the ploughman's call"
2229,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Creeps faint as smoke from black, fresh-furrowed meadows;     45"
2230,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The single crow a single caw lets fall;
2231,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And all around me every bush and tree
2232,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Says Autumn's here, and Winter soon will be,"
2233,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who snows his soft, white sleep and silence over all."
2234,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2235,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The birch, most shy and ladylike of trees,               50"
2236,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Her poverty, as best she may, retrieves,"
2237,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And hints at her foregone gentilities
2238,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,With some saved relics of her wealth of leaves;
2239,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The swamp-oak, with his royal purple on,"
2240,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Glares red as blood across the sinking sun,              55"
2241,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As one who proudlier to a falling fortune cleaves.
2242,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2243,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"He looks a sachem, in red blanket wrapt,"
2244,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who, 'mid some council of the sad-garbed whites,"
2245,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Erect and stern, in his own memories lapt,"
2246,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With distant eye broods over other sights,                 60"
2247,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Sees the hushed wood the city's flare replace,"
2248,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The wounded turf heal o'er the railway's trace,"
2249,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And roams the savage Past of his undwindled rights.
2250,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2251,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The red-oak, softer-grained, yields all for lost,"
2252,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And, with his crumpled foliage stiff and dry,              65"
2253,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"After the first betrayal of the frost,"
2254,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Rebuffs the kiss of the relenting sky:
2255,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The chestnuts, lavish of their long-hid gold,"
2256,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"To the faint Summer, beggared now and old,"
2257,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Pour back the sunshine hoarded 'neath her favoring eye.      70
2258,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2259,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The ash her purple drops forgivingly
2260,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And sadly, breaking not the general hush:"
2261,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The maple-swamps glow like a sunset sea,"
2262,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Each leaf a ripple with its separate flush;
2263,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,All round the wood's edge creeps the skirting blaze      75
2264,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of bushes low, as when, on cloudy days,"
2265,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ere the rain falls, the cautious farmer burns his brush."
2266,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2267,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"O'er yon low wall, which guards one unkempt zone,"
2268,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Where vines and weeds and scrub-oaks intertwine
2269,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Safe from the plough, whose rough, discordant stone      80"
2270,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Is massed to one soft gray by lichens fine,"
2271,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The tangled blackberry, crossed and re-crossed, weaves"
2272,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A prickly network of ensanguined leaves;
2273,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Hard by, with coral beads, the prim black-alders shine."
2274,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2275,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Pillaring with flame this crumbling boundary,            85"
2276,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whose loose blocks topple 'neath the plough-boy's foot,"
2277,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who, with each sense shut fast except the eye,"
2278,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Creeps close and scares the jay he hoped to shoot,"
2279,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The woodbine up the elm's straight stem aspires,"
2280,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Coiling it, harmless, with autumnal fires;               90"
2281,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In the ivy's paler blaze the martyr oak stands mute.
2282,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2283,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Below, the Charles, a stripe of nether sky,"
2284,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now hid by rounded apple-trees between,"
2285,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whose gaps the misplaced sail sweeps bellying by,"
2286,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Now flickering golden through a woodland screen,           95"
2287,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then spreading out, at his next turn beyond,"
2288,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A silver circle like an inland pond--
2289,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Slips seaward silently through marshes purple and green.
2290,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2291,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dear marshes! vain to him the gift of sight
2292,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Who cannot in their various incomes share,                100"
2293,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"From every season drawn, of shade and light,"
2294,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Who sees in them but levels brown and bare;
2295,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Each change of storm or sunshine scatters free
2296,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"On them its largess of variety,"
2297,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,For Nature with cheap means still works her wonders rare.     105
2298,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2299,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In spring they lie one broad expanse of green,"
2300,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er which the light winds run with glimmering feet:
2301,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Here, yellower stripes track out the creek unseen,"
2302,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There, darker growths o'er hidden ditches meet;"
2303,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And purpler stains show where the blossoms crowd,       110"
2304,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As if the silent shadow of a cloud
2305,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Hung there becalmed, with the next breath to fleet."
2306,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2307,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"All round, upon the river's slippery edge,"
2308,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Witching to deeper calm the drowsy tide,"
2309,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Whispers and leans the breeze-entangling sedge;         115
2310,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through emerald glooms the lingering waters slide,"
2311,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Or, sometimes wavering, throw back the sun,"
2312,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And the stiff banks in eddies melt and run
2313,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Of dimpling light, and with the current seem to glide."
2314,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2315,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In summer 't is a blithesome sight to see,              120"
2316,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"As, step by step, with measured swing, they pass,"
2317,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The wide-ranked mowers wading to the knee,"
2318,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Their sharp scythes panting through the wiry grass;
2319,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then, stretched beneath a rick's shade in a ring,"
2320,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Their nooning take, while one begins to sing            125"
2321,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,A stave that droops and dies 'neath the close sky of brass.
2322,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2323,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Meanwhile that devil-may-care, the bobolink."
2324,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Remembering duty, in mid-quaver stops"
2325,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Just ere he sweeps o'er rapture's tremulous brink,"
2326,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And 'twixt the winrows most demurely drops,               130"
2327,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"A decorous bird of business, who provides"
2328,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"For his brown mate and fledglings six besides,"
2329,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And looks from right to left, a farmer 'mid his crops."
2330,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2331,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Another change subdues them in the fall,"
2332,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But saddens not; they still show merrier tints,           135"
2333,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Though sober russet seems to cover all;
2334,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When the first sunshine through their dew-drops glints,"
2335,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Look how the yellow clearness, streamed across,"
2336,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Redeems with rarer hues the season's loss,"
2337,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As Dawn's feet there had touched and left their rosy prints.     140
2338,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2339,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Or come when sunset gives its freshened zest,"
2340,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Lean o 'er the bridge and let the ruddy thrill,"
2341,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"While the shorn sun swells down the hazy west,"
2342,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Glow opposite;--the marshes drink their fill
2343,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And swoon with purple veins, then, slowly fade          145"
2344,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through pink to brown, as eastward moves the shade,"
2345,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Lengthening with stealthy creep, of Simond's darkening hill."
2346,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2347,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Later, and yet ere winter wholly shuts,"
2348,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ere through the first dry snow the runner grates,"
2349,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And the loath cart-wheel screams in slippery ruts,      150"
2350,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"While firmer ice the eager boy awaits,"
2351,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Trying each buckle and strap beside the fire,"
2352,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And until bedtime plays with his desire,"
2353,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Twenty times putting on and off his new-bought skates;--
2354,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2355,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then, every morn, the river's banks shine bright        155"
2356,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With smooth plate-armor, treacherous and frail,"
2357,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"By the frost's clinking hammers forged at night,"
2358,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"'Gainst which the lances of the sun prevail,"
2359,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Giving a pretty emblem of the day
2360,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When guiltier arms in light shall melt away,            160"
2361,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And states shall move free-limbed, loosed from war's cramping mail."
2362,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2363,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And now those waterfalls the ebbing river
2364,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Twice every day creates on either side
2365,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Tinkle, as through their fresh-sparred grots they shiver"
2366,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,In grass-arched channels to the sun denied;               165
2367,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"High flaps in sparkling blue the far-heard crow,"
2368,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The silvered flats gleam frostily below,"
2369,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Suddenly drops the gull and breaks the glassy tide.
2370,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2371,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But crowned in turn by vying seasons three,"
2372,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Their winter halo hath a fuller ring;                     170
2373,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"This glory seems to rest immovably,--"
2374,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The others were too fleet and vanishing;
2375,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"When the hid tide is at its highest flow,"
2376,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,O'er marsh and stream one breathless trance of snow
2377,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,With brooding fulness awes and hushes everything.           175
2378,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2379,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The sunshine seems blown off by the bleak wind,"
2380,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,As pale as formal candles lit by day;
2381,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Gropes to the sea the river dumb and blind;
2382,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The brown ricks, snow-thatched by the storm in play,"
2383,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Show pearly breakers combing o'er their lee,            180"
2384,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"White crests as of some just enchanted sea,"
2385,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Checked in their maddest leap and hanging poised midway.
2386,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2387,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But when the eastern blow, with rain aslant."
2388,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,From mid-sea's prairies green and rolling plains
2389,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Drives in his wallowing herds of billows gaunt,         185"
2390,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And the roused Charles remembers in his veins
2391,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Old Ocean's blood and snaps his gyves of frost,"
2392,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That tyrannous silence on the shores is tost
2393,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"In dreary wreck, and crumbling desolation reigns."
2394,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2395,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Edgewise or flat, in Druid-like device,                 190"
2396,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With leaden pools between or gullies bare,"
2397,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The blocks lie strewn, a bleak Stonehenge of ice;"
2398,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"No life, no sound, to break the grim despair,"
2399,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Save sullen plunge, as through the sedges stiff"
2400,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Down crackles riverward some thaw-sapped cliff,         195"
2401,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Or when the close-wedged fields of ice crunch here and there.
2402,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2403,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,But let me turn from fancy-pictured scenes
2404,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,To that whose pastoral calm before me lies:
2405,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Here nothing harsh or rugged intervenes;
2406,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The early evening with her misty dyes                     200
2407,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Smooths off the ravelled edges of the nigh,"
2408,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Relieves the distant with her cooler sky,"
2409,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And tones the landscape down, and soothes the wearied eyes."
2410,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2411,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There gleams my native village, dear to me,"
2412,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Though higher change's waves each day are seen,           205"
2413,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Whelming fields famed in boyhood's history,"
2414,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Sanding with houses the diminished green;
2415,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There, in red brick, which softening time defies,"
2416,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Stand square and stiff the Muses' factories;--
2417,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,How with my life knit up is every well-known scene!         210
2418,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2419,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Flow on, dear river! not alone you flow"
2420,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"To outward sight, and through your marshes wind;"
2421,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Fed from the mystic springs of long-ago,"
2422,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Your twin flows silent through my world of mind:
2423,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Grow dim, dear marshes, in the evening's gray!          215"
2424,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Before my inner sight ye stretch away,"
2425,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And will forever, though these fleshly eyes grow blind."
2426,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2427,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Beyond the hillock's house-bespotted swell,"
2428,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where Gothic chapels house the horse and chaise,"
2429,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where quiet cits in Grecian temples dwell,              220"
2430,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where Coptic tombs resound with prayer and praise,"
2431,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where dust and mud the equal year divide,"
2432,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"There gentle Allston lived, and wrought, and died,"
2433,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Transfiguring street and shop with his illumined gaze.
2434,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2435,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"_Virgilium vidi tantum_,--I have seen                   225"
2436,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"But as a boy, who looks alike on all,"
2437,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That misty hair, that fine Undine-like mien."
2438,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Tremulous as down to feeling's faintest call;--
2439,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Ah, dear old homestead! count it to thy fame"
2440,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That thither many times the Painter came;--             230
2441,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"One elm yet bears his name, a feathery tree and tall."
2442,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2443,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Swiftly the present fades in memory's glow,--"
2444,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Our only sure possession is the past;
2445,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The village blacksmith died a month ago,"
2446,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And dim to me the forge's roaring blast;                  235
2447,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Soon fire-new medievals we shall see
2448,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Oust the black smithy from its chestnut-tree,"
2449,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And that hewn down, perhaps, the bee-hive green and vast."
2450,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2451,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"How many times, prouder than king on throne,"
2452,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Loosed from the village school-dame's A's and B's,        240"
2453,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Panting have I the creaky bellows blown,"
2454,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And watched the pent volcano's red increase,"
2455,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Then paused to see the ponderous sledge, brought down"
2456,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"By that hard arm voluminous and brown,"
2457,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,From the white iron swarm its golden vanishing bees.        245
2458,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2459,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Dear native town! whose choking elms each year
2460,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"With eddying dust before their time turn gray,"
2461,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Pining for rain,--to me thy dust is dear;"
2462,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"It glorifies the eve of summer day,"
2463,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"And when the westering sun half sunken burns,           250"
2464,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The mote-thick air to deepest orange turns,"
2465,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The westward horseman rides through clouds of gold away.
2466,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2467,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"So palpable, I've seen those unshorn few,"
2468,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The six old willows at the causey's end
2469,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"(Such trees Paul Potter never dreamed nor drew),        255"
2470,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Through this dry mist their checkering shadows send,"
2471,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Striped, here and there, with many a long-drawn thread,"
2472,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Where streamed through leafy chinks the trembling red,"
2473,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Past which, in one bright trail, the hang-bird's flashes blend."
2474,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2475,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Yes, dearer far thy dust than all that e'er,            260"
2476,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Beneath the awarded crown of victory,"
2477,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Gilded the blown Olympic charioteer;
2478,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Though lightly prized the ribboned parchments three,"
2479,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Yet _collegisse juvat_, I am glad"
2480,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That here what colleging was mine I had,--              265"
2481,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"It linked another tie, dear native town, with thee!"
2482,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2483,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Nearer art thou than simply native earth,"
2484,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,My dust with thine concedes a deeper tie;
2485,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"A closer claim thy soil may well put forth,"
2486,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Something of kindred more than sympathy;                  270
2487,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,For in thy bounds I reverently laid away
2488,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"That blinding anguish of forsaken clay,"
2489,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That title I seemed to have in earth and sea and sky.
2490,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,
2491,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,That portion of my life more choice to me
2492,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"(Though brief, yet in itself so round and whole)          275"
2493,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,Than all the imperfect residue can be;--
2494,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,The Artist saw his statue of the soul
2495,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"Was perfect; so, with one regretful stroke,"
2496,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,"The earthen model into fragments broke,"
2497,AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE,And without her the impoverished seasons roll.              280

2504,THE OAK,
2505,THE OAK,"What gnarlèd stretch, what depth of shade, is his!"
2506,THE OAK,There needs no crown to mark the forest's king;
2507,THE OAK,How in his leaves outshines full summer's bliss!
2508,THE OAK,"Sun, storm, rain, dew, to him their tribute bring,"
2509,THE OAK,Which he with such benignant royalty                          5
2510,THE OAK,"Accepts, as overpayeth what is lent;"
2511,THE OAK,"All nature seems his vassal proud to be,"
2512,THE OAK,And cunning only for his ornament.
2513,THE OAK,
2514,THE OAK,"How towers he, too, amid the billowed snows,"
2515,THE OAK,"An unquelled exile from the summer's throne,               10"
2516,THE OAK,"Whose plain, uncinctured front more kingly shows,"
2517,THE OAK,Now that the obscuring courtier leaves are flown.
2518,THE OAK,"His boughs make music of the winter air,"
2519,THE OAK,"Jewelled with sleet, like some cathedral front"
2520,THE OAK,Where clinging snow-flakes with quaint art repair            15
2521,THE OAK,The dents and furrows of time's envious brunt.
2522,THE OAK,
2523,THE OAK,How doth his patient strength the rude March wind
2524,THE OAK,"Persuade to seem glad breaths of summer breeze,"
2525,THE OAK,"And win the soil, that fain would be unkind,"
2526,THE OAK,To swell his revenues with proud increase!                 20
2527,THE OAK,He is the gem; and all the landscape wide
2528,THE OAK,(So doth his grandeur isolate the sense)
2529,THE OAK,"Seems but the setting, worthless all beside,"

2531,THE OAK,
2532,THE OAK,"So, from oft converse with life's wintry gales,              25"
2533,THE OAK,Should man learn how to clasp with tougher roots
2534,THE OAK,The inspiring earth; how otherwise avails
2535,THE OAK,The leaf-creating sap that sunward shoots?
2536,THE OAK,So every year that falls with noiseless flake
2537,THE OAK,"Should fill old scars up on the stormward side,            30"
2538,THE OAK,"And make hoar age revered for age's sake,"
2539,THE OAK,Not for traditions of youth's leafy pride.
2540,THE OAK,
2541,THE OAK,"So, from the pinched soil of a churlish fate,"
2542,THE OAK,"True hearts compel the sap of sturdier growth,"
2543,THE OAK,"So between earth and heaven stand simply great,              35"
2544,THE OAK,That these shall seem but their attendants both;
2545,THE OAK,For nature's forces with obedient zeal
2546,THE OAK,Wait on the rooted faith and oaken will;
2547,THE OAK,"As quickly the pretender's cheat they feel,"
2548,THE OAK,And turn mad Pucks to flout and mock him still.            40
2549,THE OAK,
2550,THE OAK,Lord! all 'Thy works are lessons; each contains
2551,THE OAK,Some emblem of man's all-containing soul;
2552,THE OAK,"Shall he make fruitless all thy glorious pains,"
2553,THE OAK,Delving within thy grace an eyeless mole?
2554,THE OAK,"Make me the least of thy Dodona-grove,                       45"
2555,THE OAK,"Cause me some message of thy truth to bring,"
2556,THE OAK,"Speak but a word through me, nor let thy love"
2557,THE OAK,Among my boughs disdain to perch and sing.

2721,THE PRESENT CRISIS,
2722,THE PRESENT CRISIS,"They were men of present valor, stalwart old iconoclasts,"

2731,THE PRESENT CRISIS,From the tombs of the old prophets steal the funeral lamps away
2732,THE PRESENT CRISIS,To light up the martyr-fagots round the prophets of to-day?              85

3076,VI,"Or, then, of Europe fronting morn-ward still,"
3077,VI,Ere any names of Serf and Peer
3078,VI,Could Nature's equal scheme deface;
3079,VI,"Here was a type of the true elder race,"
3080,VI,And one of Plutarch's men talked with us face to face.          180
3081,VI,I praise him not; it were too late;
3082,VI,And some innative weakness there must be
3083,VI,In him who condescends to victory
3084,VI,"Such as the Present gives, and cannot wait,"
3085,VI,Safe in himself as in a fate.                                 185
3086,VI,So always firmly he:
3087,VI,"He knew to bide his time,"
3088,VI,"And can his fame abide,"
3089,VI,"Still patient in his simple faith sublime,"
3090,VI,Till the wise years decide.                               190
3091,VI,"Great captains, with their guns and drums,"
3092,VI,"Disturb our judgment for the hour,"
3093,VI,But at last silence comes;
3094,VI,"These all are gone, and, standing like a tower,"
3095,VI,"Our children shall behold his fame,                           195"
3096,VI,"The kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man,"
3097,VI,"Sagacious, patient, dreading praise, not blame,"

3105,VII,Or only guess some more inspiring goal                      200
3106,VII,"Outside of Self, enduring as the pole,"
3107,VII,Along whose course the flying axles burn
3108,VII,"Of spirits bravely-pitched, earth's manlier brood;"
3109,VII,Long as below we cannot find
3110,VII,The meed that stills the inexorable mind;                     205
3111,VII,"So long this faith to some ideal Good,"
3112,VII,"Under whatever mortal names it masks,"
3113,VII,"Freedom, Law, Country, this ethereal mood"
3114,VII,"That thanks the Fates for their severer tasks,"
3115,VII,"Feeling its challenged pulses leap,                           210"
3116,VII,"While others skulk in subterfuges cheap,"
3117,VII,"And, set in Danger's van, has all the boon it asks,"
3118,VII,Shall win man's praise and woman's love;
3119,VII,Shall be a wisdom that we set above
3120,VII,"All other skills and gifts to culture dear,                     215"
3121,VII,A virtue round whose forehead we enwreathe
3122,VII,Laurels that with a living passion breathe
3123,VII,When other crowns are cold and soon grow sere.
3124,VII,"What brings us thronging these high rites to pay,"
3125,VII,"And seal these hours the noblest of our year,                   220"

3133,VIII,That flows with Freedom's honey and milk;
3134,VIII,"But 'twas they won it, sword in hand,"
3135,VIII,Making the nettle danger soft for us as silk.                   225
3136,VIII,We welcome back our bravest and our best:--
3137,VIII,"Ah me! not all! some come not with the rest,"
3138,VIII,Who went forth brave and bright as any here!
3139,VIII,"I strive to mix some gladness with my strain,"
3140,VIII,"But the sad strings complain,                             230"
3141,VIII,And will not please the ear:
3142,VIII,"I sweep them for a paean, but they wane"
3143,VIII,Again and yet again
3144,VIII,"Into a dirge, and die away in pain."
3145,VIII,"In these brave ranks I only see the gaps,                       235"
3146,VIII,"Thinking of dear ones whom the dumb turf wraps,"
3147,VIII,Dark to the triumph which they died to gain:
3148,VIII,"Fitlier may others greet the living,"
3149,VIII,For me the past is unforgiving;
3150,VIII,I with uncovered head                                     240
3151,VIII,"Salute the sacred dead,"
3152,VIII,"Who went, and who return not,--Say not so!"
3153,VIII,"'Tis not the grapes of Canaan that repay,"
3154,VIII,But the high faith that failed not by the way;
3155,VIII,Virtue treads paths that end not in the grave;                  245
3156,VIII,No ban of endless night exiles the brave:
3157,VIII,And to the saner mind
3158,VIII,We rather seem the dead that stayed behind.
3159,VIII,"Blow, trumpets, all your exultations blow!"
3160,VIII,For never shall their aureoled presence lack:                   250
3161,VIII,"I see them muster in a gleaming row,"
3162,VIII,With ever-youthful brows that nobler show;
3163,VIII,We find in our dull road their shining track;
3164,VIII,In every nobler mood
3165,VIII,"We feel the orient of their spirit glow,                        255"
3166,VIII,"Part of our life's unalterable good,"
3167,VIII,Of all our saintlier aspiration;
3168,VIII,"They come transfigured back,"
3169,VIII,"Secure from change in their high-hearted ways,"
3170,VIII,"Beautiful evermore, and with the rays                           260"

3181,IX,Dreams are those names erewhile in battle loud;
3182,IX,"Forceless as is the shadow of a cloud,"

3185,IX,"To edge resolve with, pouring without stint                     270"
3186,IX,For what makes manhood dear.
3187,IX,"Tell us not of Plantagenets,"
3188,IX,"Hapsburgs, and Guelfs, whose thin bloods crawl"
3189,IX,Down from some victor in a border-brawl!
3190,IX,"How poor their outworn coronets,                          275"
3191,IX,Matched with one leaf of that plain civic wreath
3192,IX,"Our brave for honor's blazon shall bequeath,"
3193,IX,Through whose desert a rescued Nation sets
3194,IX,"Her heel on treason, and the trumpet hears"
3195,IX,"Shout victory, tingling Europe's sullen ears                    280"

3206,X,"Still with heart and voice renewed,"
3207,X,"To heroes living and dear martyrs dead,"
3208,X,The strain should close that consecrates our brave.
3209,X,Lift the heart and lift the head!
3210,X,"Lofty be its mood and grave,                              290"
3211,X,"Not without a martial ring,"
3212,X,Not without a prouder tread
3213,X,And a peal of exultation:
3214,X,Little right has he to sing
3215,X,Through whose heart in such an hour                       295
3216,X,"Beats no march of conscious power,"
3217,X,Sweeps no tumult of elation!
3218,X,"'Tis no Man we celebrate,"

3220,X,"A hero half, and half the whim of Fate,                       300"
3221,X,But the pith and marrow of a Nation
3222,X,"Drawing force from all her men,"
3223,X,"Highest, humblest, weakest, all,--"
3224,X,"Pulsing it again through them,"
3225,X,"Till the basest can no longer cower,                            305"
3226,X,"Feeling his soul spring up divinely tall,"
3227,X,Touched but in passing by her mantle-hem.

3229,X,"How could poet ever tower,"
3230,X,"If his passions, hopes, and fears,                        310"
3231,X,"If his triumphs and his tears,"
3232,X,Kept not measure with his people?
3233,X,"Boom, cannon, boom to all the winds and waves!"
3234,X,"Clash out, glad bells, from every rocking steeple!"
3235,X,"Banners, advance with triumph, bend your staves!                315"

3245,X,"She of the open soul and open door,                           325"
3246,X,With room about her hearth for all mankind!
3247,X,"The helm from her bold front she doth unbind,"
3248,X,"Sends all her handmaid armies back to spin,"
3249,X,And bids her navies hold their thunders in.                   330
3250,X,"No challenge sends she to the elder world,"
3251,X,That looked askance and hated; a light scorn

3286,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3287,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3288,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,1. The Musing organist: There is a peculiar felicity in this musical
3289,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"introduction. The poem is like an improvisation, and was indeed"
3290,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"composed much as a musician improvises, with swift grasp of the subtle"
3291,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"suggestions of musical tones. It is a dream, an elaborate and somewhat"
3292,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"tangled metaphor, full of hidden meaning for the accordant mind, and"
3293,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"the poet appropriately gives it a setting of music, the most symbolic"
3294,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"of all the arts. It is an allegory, like any one of the adventures in"
3295,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"the _Fairie Queen_, and from the very beginning the reader must be"
3296,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"alive to the symbolic meaning, upon which Lowell, unlike Spenser,"
3297,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"places chief emphasis, rather than upon the narrative. Compare the"
3298,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,similar musical device in Browning's _Abt Vogler_ and Adelaide
3299,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,Proctor's _Lost Chord_.
3300,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3301,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"6. Theme: The theme, subject, or underlying thought of the poem is"
3302,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,expressed in line 12 below:
3303,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3304,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"""We Sinais climb and know it not;"""
3305,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3306,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,or more comprehensively in the group of four lines of which this is
3307,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,the conclusion. The organist's fingers wander listlessly over the keys
3308,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,at first; then come forms and figures from out of dreamland over the
3309,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"bridge of his careless melody, and gradually the vision takes"
3310,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,consistent and expressive shape. So the poet comes upon his central
3311,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"subject, or theme, shaped from his wandering thought and imagination."
3312,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3313,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,7. Auroral flushes: Like the first faint glimmerings of light in the
3314,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"East that point out the pathway of the rising sun, the uncertain,"
3315,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,wavering outlines of the poet's vision precede the perfected theme
3316,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,that is drawing near.
3317,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3318,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"9. Not only around our infancy, etc.: The allusion is to"
3319,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"Wordsworth's _Ode on the Intimations of Immortality_, especially these"

3332,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"And fade into the light of common day."""
3333,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3334,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,As Lowell's central theme is so intimately associated with that of
3335,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"Wordsworth's poem, if not directly suggested by it, the two poems"
3336,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"should be read together and compared. Lowell maintains that ""heaven"
3337,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"lies about us"" not only in our infancy, but at all times, if only we"
3338,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,have the soul to comprehend it.
3339,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3340,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"12. We Sinais climb, etc.: Mount Sinai was the mountain in Arabia on"
3341,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"which Moses talked with God (_Exodus_ xix, xx). God's miracles are"
3342,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"taking place about us all the time, if only we can emancipate our"
3343,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,souls sufficiently to see them. From out of our materialized daily
3344,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"lives we may rise at any moment, if we will, to ideal and spiritual"
3345,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"things. In a letter to his nephew Lowell says: ""This same name of God"
3346,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,is written all over the world in little phenomena that occur under our
3347,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"eyes every moment, and I confess that I feel very much inclined to"
3348,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,hang my head with Pizarro when I cannot translate those hieroglyphics

3371,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,

3380,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3381,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,While reading _Sir Launfal_ the fact must be kept in mind that Lowell
3382,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,was at the time of writing the poem filled with the spirit of freedom
3383,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"and reform, and was writing fiery articles in prose for the"
3384,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"_Anti-Slavery Standard_, expressing his bitter indignation at the"

3388,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"17. Druid wood: The Druids were the aged priests of the Celts, who"
3389,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"performed their religious ceremonies in the forests, especially among"
3390,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"oaks, which were peculiarly sacred to them. Hence the venerable woods,"
3391,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"like the aged priests, offer their benediction. Every power of nature,"
3392,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"the winds, the mountain, the wood, the sea, has a symbolic meaning"
3393,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,which we should be able to interpret for our inspiration and

3431,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,32-95. This rapturous passage descriptive of June is unquestionably
3432,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,the most familiar and most celebrated piece of nature poetry in our
3433,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,literature. It is not only beautiful and inspiring in its felicitous
3434,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"phrasings of external nature, but it is especially significant as a"
3435,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,true expression of the heart and soul of the poet himself. It was
3436,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"always ""the high-tide of the year"" with Lowell in June, when his"
3437,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,spirits were in fine accord with the universal joy of nature. Wherever
3438,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"in his poetry he refers to spring and its associations, he always"
3439,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,expresses the same ecstasy of delight. The passage must be compared
3440,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,with the opening lines of _Under the Willows_ (which he at first named
3441,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,_A June Idyll_):
3442,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3443,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"""June is the pearl of our New England year."
3444,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"Still a surprisal, though expected long,"
3445,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"Her coming startles. Long she lies in wait,"
3446,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"Makes many a feint, peeps forth, draws coyly back,"

3449,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3450,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,And in _Sunthin' in the Pastoral Line_ the coming of spring is

3456,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"In a letter written in June, 1867, Lowell says: ""There never _is_ such"

3500,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,
3501,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,It must be remembered that this humanizing of nature is an attitude

3572,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,and pride stands aloof from democracy with its humility and aspiration
3573,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,for human brotherhood. This stanza is especially figurative. The poet

3612,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,his fatal mistake; his noble spirit and lofty purposes break down with
3613,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,the first test. He refuses to see a brother in the loathsome leper;
3614,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,the light and warmth of human brotherhood had not yet entered his

3616,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,The regeneration of his soul must be worked out through wandering and

3711,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,"year's log, and connected with its burning were many quaint"
3712,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,superstitions and customs. The celebration is a survival through our
3713,_THE VISION OF SIR LAUNFAL_,Scandinavian ancestors of the winter festival in honor of the god

3947,_HEBE_,
3948,_HEBE_,Lowell suggests in this dainty symbolical lyric his conception of the
3949,_HEBE_,"poet's inspiration. Hebe was cup-bearer to the gods of Olympus, in"
3950,_HEBE_,"Greek mythology, and poured for them their nectar. She was also the"
3951,_HEBE_,goddess of eternal youth. By an extension of the symbolism she becomes
3952,_HEBE_,"goddess of the eternal joyousness of the poetic gift. The ""influence"

3954,_HEBE_,poet. But Pegasus cannot be made to work in harness at will. True
3955,_HEBE_,inspiration comes only in choice moments. Coy Hebe cannot be wooed

4010,_MY LOVE_,"strong simplicity and crystal purity of style, it is a little"
4011,_MY LOVE_,masterpiece. Though filled with the passion of his new and beautiful

4236,_AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE_,festival of Greece. Lowell puns upon the word _collegisse_ with his
4237,_AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE_,"own coinage, which may have the double meaning of _going to college_"
4238,_AN INDIAN-SUMMER REVERIE_,and _collecting._

4269,_BEAVER BROOK_,Beaver Brook at Waverley was a favorite resort of Lowell's and it is
4270,_BEAVER BROOK_,often mentioned in his writings. In summer and winter it was the
4271,_BEAVER BROOK_,frequent goal of his walks. The poem was at first called _The Mill_.
4272,_BEAVER BROOK_,"It was first published in the _Anti-Slavery Standard_, and to the"
4273,_BEAVER BROOK_,"editor, Sidney H. Gay, Lowell wrote:--""Don't you like the poem I sent"

4296,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,
4297,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,This poem was written in 1844. The discussion over the annexation of
4298,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,Texas was absorbing public attention. The anti-slavery party opposed
4299,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"annexation, believing that it would strengthen the slave-holding"
4300,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"interests, and for the same reason the South was urging the scheme."
4301,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"Lowell wrote several very strong anti-slavery poems at this time, _To"
4302,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"W.L. Garrison_, _Wendell Phillips_, _On the Death of C.T. Torrey_, and"
4303,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"others, which attracted attention to him as a new and powerful ally of"

4309,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,
4310,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"While the poem was inspired by the political struggle of the time,"
4311,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,which Lowell regarded as a crisis in the history of our national honor
4312,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"and progress, its chief strength is due to the fact that its lofty"
4313,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,"sentiment is universal in its appeal, and not applicable merely to"
4314,_THE PRESENT CRISIS_,temporal and local conditions.

4390,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Lowell first published it in 1865. He afterward made a few verbal
4391,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"changes, and added one new strophe after the eighth. There is a"
4392,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,special interest in studying the ode in the form in which it came
4393,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,rushing from the poet's brain.
4394,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4395,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,1-14. The deeds of the poet are weak and trivial compared with the
4396,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,deeds of heroes. They live their high ideals and die for them. Yet the
4397,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,gentle words of the poet may sometimes save unusual lives from that
4398,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,oblivion to which all common lives are destined.

4401,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Wood._
4402,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4403,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,9. Squadron-strophes: The term _strophe_ originally was applied to
4404,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"a metrical form that was repeated in a certain established way, like"
4405,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"the _strophe_ and _antistrophe_ of the Greek ode, as sung by a divided"
4406,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,chorus; it is now applied to any stanza form. The poem of heroism is a
4407,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"""battle-ode,"" whose successive stanzas are marching squadrons, whose"
4408,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"verses are lines of blazing guns, and whose melody is the strenuous"

4419,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Alma Mater.
4420,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4421,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"20. Peddling: Engaging in small, trifling interests. Lowell's"
4422,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"attitude toward science is that of Wordsworth, when he speaks of the"

4432,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"To scorn delights and live laborious days."""
4433,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4434,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,32. Half-virtues: Is Lowell disparaging the virtues of peace and
4435,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,home in comparison with the heroic virtues of war? Or are these
4436,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"""half-virtues"" contrasted with the loftier virtue, the devotion to"
4437,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Truth?
4438,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4439,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"34. That stern device: The seal of Harvard College, chosen by its"

4444,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"of irony in the word, with a glance at the gloomy faith of early"
4445,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"puritanism and its ""lifeless creed"" (l. 62)."
4446,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4447,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,62. Lifeless creed: Compare Tennyson's:

4450,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Thro' which the spirit breathes no more."""
4451,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4452,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,73. The tide of the ocean in its flow and ebb is under the influence
4453,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"of the moon. To get the sense of the metaphor, ""fickle"" must be read"
4454,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"with ""Fortune""--unless, perchance, we like Juliet regard the moon as"
4455,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"the ""inconstant moon."""
4456,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4457,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,81. To protect one's self everyone connives against everyone else.
4458,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Compare _Sir Launfal_, I. 11. Instead of climbing Sinais we ""cringe"
4459,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"and plot."""
4460,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,

4475,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,divine fountains.
4476,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4477,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"110-114. In shaping this elaborate battle metaphor, one can easily"
4478,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,believe the poet to have had in mind some fierce mountain struggle
4479,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"during the war, such as the battle of Lookout Mountain."
4480,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4481,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"111. Creeds: Here used in the broad sense of convictions,"
4482,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"principles, beliefs."
4483,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4484,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,115-118. The construction is faulty in these lines. The two last
4485,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,clauses should be co-ordinated. The substance of the meaning is: Peace
4486,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"has her wreath, while the cannon are silent and while the sword"
4487,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,slumbers. Lowell's attention was called to this defective passage by
4488,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"T.W. Higginson, and he replied: ""Your criticism is perfectly just, and"
4489,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"I am much obliged to you for it--though I might defend myself, I"
4490,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"believe, by some constructions even looser in some of the Greek"
4491,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"choruses. But on the whole, when I have my choice, I prefer to make"
4492,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"sense."" He then suggested an emendation, which somehow failed to get"
4493,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,into the published poem:
4494,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4495,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"""Ere yet the sharp, decisive word"
4496,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Redden the cannon's lips, and while the sword."""

4500,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4501,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"147-205. This strophe was not in the ode as delivered, but was written"
4502,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"immediately after the occasion, and included in the published poem."
4503,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"""It is so completely imbedded in the structure of the ode,"" says"
4504,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Scudder, ""that it is difficult to think of it as an afterthought. It"
4505,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,is easy to perceive that while the glow of composition and of
4506,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"recitation was still upon him, Lowell suddenly conceived this splendid"
4507,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"illustration, and indeed climax of the utterance, of the Ideal which"
4508,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,is so impressive in the fifth stanza.... Into these threescore lines
4509,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Lowell has poured a conception of Lincoln, which may justly be said to"
4510,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,be to-day the accepted idea which Americans hold of their great
4511,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,President. It was the final expression of the judgment which had
4512,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"slowly been forming in Lowell's own mind."""
4513,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4514,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"In a letter to Richard Watson Gilder, Lowell says: ""The passage about"
4515,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Lincoln was not in the ode as originally recited, but added"
4516,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"immediately after. More than eighteen months before, however, I had"
4517,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,written about Lincoln in the _North American Review_--an article that
4518,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,pleased him. I _did_ divine him earlier than most men of the Brahmin

4520,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4521,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"It is a singular fact that the other great New England poets,"

4523,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Lincoln.
4524,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4525,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"150. Wept with the passion, etc.: An article in the _Atlantic"
4526,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Monthly_ for June, 1885, began with this passage: ""The funeral"
4527,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,procession of the late President of the United States has passed
4528,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,through the land from Washington to his final resting-place in the
4529,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,heart of the prairies. Along the line of more than fifteen hundred
4530,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"miles his remains were borne, as it were, through continued lines of"
4531,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,the people; and the number of mourners and the sincerity and unanimity
4532,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,of grief was such as never before attended the obsequies of a human
4533,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,being; so that the terrible catastrophe of his end hardly struck more
4534,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"awe than the majestic sorrow of the people."""
4535,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4536,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,170. Outward grace is dust: An allusion to Lincoln's awkward and
4537,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,rather unkempt outward appearance.
4538,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4539,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,173. Supple-tempered will: One of the most pronounced traits of
4540,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Lincoln's character was his kindly, almost femininely gentle and"
4541,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"sympathetic spirit. With this, however, was combined a determination"
4542,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,of steel.
4543,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4544,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"175-178. Nothing of Europe here: There was nothing of Europe in him,"
4545,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"or, if anything, it was of Europe in her early ages of freedom before"
4546,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"there was any distinction of slave and master, groveling Russian Serf"
4547,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,and noble Lord or Peer.
4548,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4549,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,180. One of Plutarch's men: The distinguished men of Greece and Rome

4557,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Lincoln's wonderful patience and faith.
4558,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,
4559,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"198. The first American: In a prose article, Lowell calls him ""The"
4560,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"American of Americans."" Compare Tennyson's ""The last great"
4561,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,"Englishman,"" in the _Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington_."
4562,_THE COMMEMORATION ODE_,Stanza IV of Tennyson's ode should be compared with this Lincoln
