96,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The Bride
97,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
98,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
99,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
100,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The little white bride is left alone
101,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","With him, her lord; the guests have gone;"
102,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The festal hall is dim.
103,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","No jesting now, nor answering mirth."
104,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The hush of sleep falls on the earth
105,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And leaves her here with him.
106,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
107,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Why should there be, O little white bride,"
108,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When the world has left you by his side,"
109,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A tear to brim your eyes?
110,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Some old love-face that comes again,"
111,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Some old love-moment sweet with pain
112,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Of passionate memories?
113,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
114,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Does your heart yearn back with last regret
115,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For the maiden meads of mignonette
116,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And the fairy-haunted wood,"
117,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","That you had not withheld from love,"
118,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A little while, the freedom of"
119,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Your happy maidenhood?
120,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
121,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Or is it but a nameless fear,"
122,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A wordless joy, that calls the tear"
123,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","In dumb appeal to rise,"
124,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When, looking on him where he stands,"
125,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","You yield up all into his hands,"
126,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Pleading into his eyes?
127,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
128,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For days that laugh or nights that weep
129,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",You two strike oars across the deep
130,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",With life's tide at the brim;
131,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And all time's beauty, all love's grace"
132,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Beams, little bride, upon your face"
133,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Here, looking up at him."

139,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
140,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
141,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
142,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Love, should I set my heart upon a crown,"
143,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Squander my years, and gain it,"
144,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",What recompense of pleasure could I own?
145,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For youth's red drops would stain it.
146,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
147,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Much have I thought on what our lives may mean,"
148,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And what their best endeavor,"
149,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Seeing we may not come again to glean,"
150,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","But, losing, lose forever."
151,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
152,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Seeing how zealots, making choice of pain,"
153,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","From home and country parted,"
154,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Have thought it life to leave their fellows slain,"
155,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Their women broken-hearted;
156,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
157,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","How teasing truth a thousand faces claims,"
158,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","As in a broken mirror,"
159,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And what a father died for in the flames
160,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",His own son scorns as error;
161,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
162,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",How even they whose hearts were sweet with song
163,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Must quaff oblivion's potion,"
164,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And, soon or late, their sails be lost along"
165,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The all-surrounding ocean:
166,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
167,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Oh, ask me not the haven of our ships,"
168,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Nor what flag floats above you!
169,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","I hold you close, I kiss your sweet, sweet lips,"
170,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And love you, love you, love you!"
171,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",

177,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
178,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
179,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When first I stood before you,"
180,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Isabel,"
181,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","I stood there to adore you,"
182,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",In your spell;
183,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","For all that grace composes,"
184,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And all that beauty knows is
185,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Your face above the roses,"
186,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Isabel.
187,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
188,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","You knew the charm of flowers,"
189,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Isabel,"
190,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Which, like incarnate hours,"
191,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Rose and fell
192,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","At your bosom, glowed and gloried,"
193,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","White and pale and pink and florid,"
194,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And you touched them with your forehead,"
195,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Isabel.
196,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
197,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Amid the jest and laughter,"
198,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Isabel,"
199,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","I saw you, and thereafter,"
200,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Ill or well,"
201,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","There was nothing else worth seeing,"
202,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Worth following or fleeing,"
203,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And no reason else for being,"
204,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Isabel.

210,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
211,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
212,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
213,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Some time, far hence, when Autumn sheds"
214,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Her frost upon your hair,"
215,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And you together sit at dusk,"
216,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",May I come to you there?
217,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And lightly will our hearts turn back
218,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","To this, then distant, day"
219,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When, while the world was clad in flowers,"
220,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",You two were wed in May.
221,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
222,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",When we shall sit about your board
223,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Three old friends met again,"
224,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Joy will be with us, but not much"
225,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Of jest and laughter then;
226,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","For Autumn's large content and calm,"
227,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Like heaven's own smile, will bless"
228,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The harvest of your happy lives
229,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",With store of happiness.
230,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
231,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","May you, who, flankt about with flowers,"
232,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Will plight your faith to-day,"
233,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Hold, evermore enthroned, the love"
234,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Which you have crowned in May;
235,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And Time will sleep upon his scythe,"
236,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The swallow rest his wing,"
237,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Seeing that you at autumntide
238,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Still clasp the hands of spring.

243,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",To Melvin Gardner:  Suicide
244,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
245,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
246,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
247,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A flight of doves, with wanton wings,"
248,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Flash white against the sky.
249,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","In the leafy copse an oriole sings,"
250,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And a robin sings hard by.
251,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Sun and shadow are out on the hills;
252,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The swallow has followed the daffodils;
253,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","In leaf and blade, life throbs and thrills"
254,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Through the wild, warm heart of May."
255,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
256,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","To have seen the sun come back, to have seen"
257,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Children again at play,"
258,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",To have heard the thrush where the woods are green
259,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Welcome the new-born day,"
260,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","To have felt the soft grass cool to the feet,"
261,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","To have smelt earth's incense, heavenly sweet,"
262,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","To have shared the laughter along the street,"
263,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And, then, to have died in May!"
264,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
265,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A thousand roses will blossom red,"
266,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A thousand hearts be gay,"
267,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For the summer lingers just ahead
268,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And June is on her way;
269,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The bee must bestir him to fill his cells,"
270,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The moon and the stars will weave new spells
271,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Of love and the music of marriage bells--
272,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And, oh, to be dead in May!"
273,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
274,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
275,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
276,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
277,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Away Down Home
278,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
279,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
280,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
281,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",'T will not be long before they hear
282,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The bullbat on the hill,"
283,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And in the valley through the dusk
284,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The pastoral whippoorwill.
285,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A few more friendly suns will call
286,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The bluets through the loam
287,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And star the lanes with buttercups
288,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Away down home.
289,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
290,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","""Knee-deep!"" from reedy places"
291,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Will sing the river frogs.
292,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The terrapins will sun themselves
293,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",On all the jutting logs.
294,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The angler's cautious oar will leave
295,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A trail of drifting foam
296,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Along the shady currents
297,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Away down home.
298,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
299,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The mocking-bird will feel again
300,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The glory of his wings,"
301,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And wanton through the balmy air
302,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And sunshine while he sings,"
303,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","With a new cadence in his call,"
304,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The glint-wing'd crow will roam
305,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",From field to newly-furrowed field
306,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Away down home.
307,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
308,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",When dogwood blossoms mingle
309,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","With the maple's modest red,"
310,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And sweet arbutus wakes at last
311,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","From out her winter's bed,"
312,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",'T would not seem strange at all to meet
313,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A dryad or a gnome,"
314,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Or Pan or Psyche in the woods
315,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Away down home.
316,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
317,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Then come with me, thou weary heart!"
318,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Forget thy brooding ills,"
319,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Since God has come to walk among
320,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",His valleys and his hills!
321,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The mart will never miss thee,"
322,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Nor the scholar's dusty tome,"
323,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And the Mother waits to bless thee,"
324,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Away down home.

329,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For Jane's Birthday
330,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
331,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
332,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
333,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",If fate had held a careless knife
334,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And clipped one line that drew,"
335,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Of all the myriad lines of life,"
336,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",From Eden up to you;
337,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","If, in the wars and wastes of time,"
338,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","One sire had met the sword,"
339,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",One mother died before her prime
340,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Or wed some other lord;
341,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
342,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Or had some other age been blest,"
343,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Long past or yet to be,"
344,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And you had been the world's sweet guest
345,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Before or after me:
346,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","I wonder how this rose would seem,"
347,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Or yonder hillside cot;
348,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","For, dear, I cannot even dream"
349,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A world where you are not!
350,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
351,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Thus heaven forfends that I shall drink
352,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The gall that might have been,"
353,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",If aught had broken a single link
354,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Along the lists of men;
355,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And heaven forgives me, whom it loves,"
356,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For feigning such distress:
357,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",My heart is happiest when it proves
358,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Its depth of happiness.
359,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
360,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Enough to see you where you are,"
361,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Radiant with maiden mirth!
362,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",To bless whatever blessed star
363,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Presided o'er your birth,"
364,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","That, on this immemorial morn,"
365,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When heaven was bending low,"
366,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The gods were kind and you were born
367,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Twenty sweet years ago!

372,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A Secret
373,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
374,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
375,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
376,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A little baby went to sleep
377,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","One night in his white bed,"
378,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And the moon came by to take a peep
379,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",At the little baby head.
380,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
381,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A wind, as wandering winds will do,"
382,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Brought to the baby there
383,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Sweet smells from some quaint flower that grew
384,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Out on some hill somewhere.
385,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
386,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And wind and flower and pale moonbeam
387,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",About the baby's bed
388,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Stirred and woke the funniest dream
389,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",In the little sleepy head.
390,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
391,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",He thought he was all sorts of things
392,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",From a lion to a cat;
393,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Sometimes he thought he flew on wings,"
394,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Or fell and fell, so that"
395,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
396,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",When morning broke he was right glad
397,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",But much surprised to see
398,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Himself a soft, pink little lad"
399,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Just like he used to be.
400,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
401,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",I would not give this story fame
402,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","If there were room to doubt it,"
403,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","But when he learned to talk, he came"
404,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And told me all about it.

409,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The Old Bad Woman
410,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
411,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
412,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
413,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The Old Bad Woman was coming along,"
414,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Busily humming a sort of song.
415,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
416,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","You could barely see, below her bonnet,"
417,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Her chin where her long nose rested on it.
418,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
419,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","One tooth thrust out on her lower lip,"
420,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And she held one hand upon her hip.
421,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
422,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Then we went to thinking mighty fast,"
423,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For we knew our time had come at last.
424,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
425,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",For what we had done and didn't do
426,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The Old Bad Woman would put us through.

428,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","If you cried enough to fill your hat,"

430,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
431,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Of the jam we had eaten, she would know;"
432,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",How we ran barefooted in the snow;
433,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
434,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",How we cried when they made us take our bath;
435,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",How we tied the grass across the path;
436,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
437,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",How we bound together the cat and cur--
438,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",We couldn't deny these things to her.
439,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
440,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",She pulled her nose up off her chin

442,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
443,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And we almost died, becaze and because"

449,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",You needn't guess how she put us through.
450,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","If you are bad, she'll visit you."
451,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
452,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And when she leaves and hobbles off

502,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Led on, as by Enemo's silken strand,"
503,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",I come and gaze and gaze upon thy face.
504,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
505,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Framed round by silence, poised on pearl-white grace"
506,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Of curving throat, too sweet for beaded band,"
507,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",It seems as if some wizard's magic wand
508,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Had wrought thee for the love of all the race.
509,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
510,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Dear face, that will not turn about to see"

535,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Yeke-hey, yeke-hey, hey-diddle-diddle--"
536,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When, while the fire-logs fell apart,"
537,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","He snatched the bow across his fiddle,"
538,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And looked on, with his eyes half shut,"
539,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Which meant his soul was wild with fun,"
540,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",At our mad capers through the hut
541,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Of old man Jesse Covington.
542,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
543,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","For all the thrilling tales he told,"

568,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
569,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",In a warm crevice of the bark
570,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A basking scorpion clung,"
571,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",With bright blue tail and red-rimmed eyes
572,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And yellow, twinkling tongue."
573,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
574,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A lunging trout flashed in the sun,"
575,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","To do some petty slaughter,"
576,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And set the spiders all a-run
577,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",On little stilts of water.
578,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
579,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Toward noon upon the swamp there stole
580,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","A deep, cathedral hush,"

1957,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1958,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And then, with a snort and a clang of steel,"
1959,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","She settles her strength to the stubborn wheel,"
1960,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1961,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And out, through the tracks that lead astray,"
1962,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Cautiously, slowly she picks her way,"
1963,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1964,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And gathers her muscle and guards her nerve,"
1965,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","When she swings her nose to the westward curve,"
1966,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1967,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And takes the grade, which slopes to the sky,"

1970,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","The hazy horizon is all she sees,"

1976,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Nor the cots and hamlets that know no more

1978,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1979,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","But, bearing her tidings, she trembles and throbs,"
1980,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And laughs in her throat, and quivers and sobs;"
1981,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1982,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And the fire in her heart is a red core of heat,"

1984,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1985,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Till she sees the ships in their harbor at rest,"
1986,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",And sniffs at the trail to the end of her quest.
1987,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1988,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","If I were the driver who handles her reins,"

1996,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
1997,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","With the snow on her back and the sun in her face,"
1998,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And nothing but time as a quarry to chase,"
1999,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2000,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","I should grip hard my teeth, and look where she led,"
2001,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","And brace myself stooping, and give her her head,"

2102,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2103,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2104,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","John Charles McNeill was born in Scotland County, near Laurinburg, North"
2105,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Carolina, on 26 July 1874, and died on 17 October 1907 (when he was 33"
2106,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","years old). He only produced this one volume before he died, though he"
2107,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","planned a second, which was published posthumously. ""Songs, Merry and"
2108,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Sad"", first published in Charlotte in 1906, went through at least five"
2109,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",printings over more than 60 years. (This text is taken from the very
2110,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",first edition.)
2111,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2112,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Both of McNeill's grandfathers came from Scotland.
2113,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2114,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","McNeill attended Wake Forest College, where he received both his"
2115,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Bachelor's and Master's degrees. In 1899-1900 he taught English at
2116,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Mercer University.
2117,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2118,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",Some of his poems were published nationally as early as 1901. More of
2119,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","his poems were published by `The Charlotte Observer' starting in 1903,"
2120,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",and in 1904 he joined its staff.
2121,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2122,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2123,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","This etext was created by entering the text (manually) twice, once from"
2124,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","the first printing (1906) and once from the second printing (no date),"
2125,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",and comparing the two. There were some slight differences in the two
2126,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",printings.
2127,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2128,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",A portrait of John Charles McNeill faces the title page (p. 3) in the
2129,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","second printing, but is absent in the first."
2130,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2131,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The first printing gives the publisher as Stone & Barringer Co. and
2132,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",gives the date as 1906. The second printing gives the publisher as
2133,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Stone Publishing Co., and gives no date. Both were printed in"
2134,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Charlotte, N.C."
2135,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2136,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",One error was corrected (the second printing also corrected this error):
2137,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2138,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",(p. 73)
2139,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","[ A holy presence hovers round here there, ]"
2140,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",changed to:
2141,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","[ A holy presence hovers round her there, ]"
2142,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2143,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2144,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The second printing also changed the title of the poem [ To Melvin
2145,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Gardner: Suicide ], on p. 19, to [ To Melvin Gardner: ]--in the text,"
2146,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",but not in the table of Contents. This may have been done in deference
2147,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",to the family--attitudes on suicide were once quite different than
2148,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","now--but as it has been quite some time, and the original title gives"
2149,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","more meaning to the poem, it has been retained."
2150,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2151,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",The Title of the poem [ Now! ] did not have the exclamation point in the
2152,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",table of Contents. It has been added to match the text. The Title of
2153,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","the poem [ ""97"": The Fast Mail ] appeared as such in the text, but as"
2154,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","[""97:"" The Fast Mail ] in the Contents. The latter was changed to match"
2155,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",the text.
2156,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2157,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","In the original, the book's title does not separate the Contents from"
2158,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",the first poem. It has been placed there as a sort of divider.
2159,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",
2160,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",In two places ASCII fails to provide enough characters for a correct
2161,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD",rendering. They are the words Provencal (the c with a cedilla) and
2162,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","mailed (the e with an acute accent, to indicate that the word is to be"
2163,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","said with two syllables). These occur in ""Reminiscence"" and ""The"
2164,"SONGS, MERRY AND SAD","Rattlesnake""."
