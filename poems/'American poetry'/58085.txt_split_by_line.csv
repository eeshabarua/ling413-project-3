542,II,
543,II,The gods of Greece are mine once more!
544,II,The old philosophies again!
545,II,For I have drunk the hellebore
546,II,"Of dreams, and dreams have made me sane--"
547,II,The wine of dreams! that doth unfold
548,II,"My other self,--’mid shadowy shrines"
549,II,"Of myths which marble held of old,"
550,II,"Part of the Age of Bronze or Gold,--"
551,II,"That lives, a pagan, ’mid the pines."
552,II,
553,II,"Dead myths, to whom such dreams belong!"
554,II,O beautiful philosophies
555,II,Of Nature! crystallized in song
556,II,"And marble, peopling lost seas,"
557,II,"Lost forests and the star-lost vast,"
558,II,Grant me the childlike faith that clung.--
559,II,"Through loveliness that could not last,--"
560,II,"To Heaven in the pagan past,"
561,II,Calling for God with infant tongue!
562,II,
563,II,
564,III,III
565,III,
566,III,"Idea, god of Plato! one"
567,III,"With beauty, justice, truth and love:"
568,III,"Who, type by type, the world begun"
569,III,From an ideal world above!
570,III,"Reason, who into Nature wrought"
571,III,"Your real entities,--which are"
572,III,"Ideas,--giving to our star"
573,III,Their beauty through reflected thought;
574,III,
575,III,"The reminiscences that flame,"
576,III,"Momental, through the mind of man,"
577,III,"Of things his memory can not name,"
578,III,"Lost things his knowledge can not scan,--"
579,III,"Hints of past periods are not these,"
580,III,His soul hath lived since it had birth
581,III,In God?--Yea! who shall say that Earth
582,III,More ancient is than he who sees?
583,III,
584,III,
585,IV,IV
586,IV,
587,IV,"Beside us, and yet far above,"
588,IV,She leads us to no base renown--
589,IV,"The Ideal, with her sun-white crown,"
590,IV,And starry raiment of her love:
591,IV,She leads us by ascending ways
592,IV,"Of Nature to her purposed ends,"
593,IV,"Who in the difficult, dark days"
594,IV,Of trial with her smile defends.
595,IV,
596,IV,"Beyond the years, that blindly grope,"
597,IV,"To climb with her, from year to year,"
598,IV,"To some exalted atmosphere,"
599,IV,Were more than earthly joy or hope!
600,IV,Though in that atmosphere we find
601,IV,"Not her--her influence, pointing to"
602,IV,New elevations of the mind
603,IV,By some superior avenue.
604,IV,
605,IV,
606,V,V
607,V,
608,V,The climbing-cricket in the dusk
609,V,Moves wings of moony gossamer;
610,V,"Its vague, vibrating note I hear"
611,V,"Among the boughs of dew and musk,"
612,V,"Whence, rustling with a mellow thud,"
613,V,"The ripe quince falls. Low, deep and clear,"
614,V,The west is bound with burning blood.
615,V,
616,V,"The slanting bats beneath the moon,--"
617,V,"A dark disk edge with glittering white,--"
618,V,Spin loops of intertangled night:
619,V,"An owl wakes, hooting over soon,"
620,V,Within the forest far away:
621,V,"And now the heav’n fills, light by light,"
622,V,And all the blood-red west grows gray.
623,V,
624,V,I hear no sound of wind or wave;
625,V,"No sob or song, except the slow"
626,V,"Leaf-cricket’s flute-soft tremolo,"
627,V,Among wet walks grown gray and grave.--
628,V,"In raiment mists of silver sear,"
629,V,"With strange, pale eyes thou comest, O"
630,V,Thou Spirit of the Waning-Year!
631,V,
632,V,
633,VI,VI
634,VI,
635,VI,The hills are full of prophecies
636,VI,And ancient voices of the dead;
637,VI,"Of hidden shapes that no man sees,"
638,VI,"Pale, visionary presences,"
639,VI,"That speak the things no tongue hath said,"
640,VI,"No mind hath thought, no eye hath read."
641,VI,
642,VI,"The streams are full of oracles,"
643,VI,And momentary whisperings;
644,VI,An immaterial beauty swells
645,VI,Its breezy silver o’er the shells
646,VI,With wordless speech that sings and sings
647,VI,The real life of unreal things.
648,VI,
649,VI,"No indeterminable thought is theirs,"
650,VI,"The stars’, the sunsets’ and the flowers’;"
651,VI,Whose inexpressible speech declares
652,VI,"Th’ immortal Beautiful, who shares"
653,VI,"This mortal riddle which is ours,"
654,VI,Beyond the forward-flying hours.
655,VI,
656,VI,
657,VII,VII
658,VII,
659,VII,"The hornet stings the garnet grape,"
660,VII,Whose hull splits with the honeyed heat;--
661,VII,Fall hears the long loud locust beat
662,VII,"Its song out, where, a girl-like shape,"
663,VII,"She watches, through the wine-press’ crust,"
664,VII,Sweet trickle of the purple must.
665,VII,
666,VII,"The bee clings to the scarlet peach,"
667,VII,That thrusts a downy cheek between
668,VII,The leaves of golden gray and green;--
669,VII,Fall walks where orchard branches reach
670,VII,"Abundance to her hands, or drop"
671,VII,Their ripeness down to make her stop.
672,VII,
673,VII,The bitter-sweet and sassafras
674,VII,Hang yellow pods and crimson-black
675,VII,"Along the rails, that ramble back"
676,VII,Among the corn where she must pass;
677,VII,"Where, on her hair, a golden haze,"
678,VII,Showers the pollen of the maize.
679,VII,
680,VII,"Not till ’mid sad, chill scents all day"
681,VII,"The green leaf-cricket chirrs its tune,"
682,VII,And underneath the hunter’s-moon
683,VII,"The oxen plod through clinging clay,"
684,VII,"Or when, beyond the dripping pane,"
685,VII,The night sets in with whirling rain:
686,VII,
687,VII,Not till ripe walnuts rain their spice
688,VII,"Of frost-nipped nuts down, and the oak"
689,VII,"Pelts with brown acorns, stroke on stroke,"
690,VII,The creek that slides through hints of ice;
691,VII,"And in the lane the wagon pulls,"
692,VII,"Crunching, through thick-strewn hickory hulls:"
693,VII,
694,VII,"Not till through frosty fogs, which hold"
695,VII,"Wet mornings with their phantom night,"
696,VII,"Like torches glimmering through the white,"
697,VII,"The woods burn crimson blurs and gold,"
698,VII,And through the mist come muffled sounds
699,VII,Of hunting-horns and baying hounds:
700,VII,
701,VII,"Shall I on hills, where looming pines"
702,VII,Against vermilion sunsets stand--
703,VII,Black ruins in a blood-red land--
704,VII,"In wrecks of sumac and wild vines,"
705,VII,"Go seek her, where she lies asleep,"
706,VII,"Her dark, sad eyes too tired to weep."
707,VII,
708,VII,
709,VIII,VIII
710,VIII,
711,VIII,It holds and beckons in the streams;
712,VIII,It lures and touches us in all
713,VIII,The flowers of the golden fall--
714,VIII,The mystic essence of our dreams:
715,VIII,A nymph blows bubbling music where
716,VIII,Faint water ripples down the rocks;
717,VIII,"A faun goes dancing hoiden locks,"
718,VIII,"And piping a Pandean air,"
719,VIII,Through trees the instant wind shakes bare.
720,VIII,
721,VIII,Our dreams are never otherwise
722,VIII,Than real when they hold us so;
723,VIII,We in some future life shall know
724,VIII,Them parts of it and recognize
725,VIII,"Them as ideal substance, whence"
726,VIII,"The actual is--(as flowers and trees,"
727,VIII,"From color sources no one sees,"
728,VIII,"Draw dyes, the substance of a sense)--"
729,VIII,Material with intelligence.
730,VIII,
731,VIII,
732,IX,IX
733,IX,
734,IX,Once more I watch the hills take fire
735,IX,"With dawn; and, shaggy spine by spine,"
736,IX,"Flush like dark tyrants o’er their wine,"
737,IX,"Who grasp the sword and break the lyre,"
738,IX,And carve the world to their desire;
739,IX,"While, red as blocks where kingdoms bleed,"
740,IX,The rocks trail crimson vine and weed.
741,IX,
742,IX,"To walls of gold, Enchantment built,"
743,IX,Again my fancy bids me go--
744,IX,"Through woods, bewitched with fire, where blow"
745,IX,Wild horns of tournament and tilt--
746,IX,"A fairy-prince, whose spear hath spilt"
747,IX,"No blood but in a shadow-world,"
748,IX,While at the real his gage is hurled.
749,IX,
750,IX,"What far, æolian echoes lead"
751,IX,My longing?--as a voice might wake
752,IX,"A lost child from deep sleep and take,"
753,IX,"With music of a magic reed,"
754,IX,Him home where love will give him heed:--
755,IX,"What echoes, blown from lands that lie"
756,IX,Melodious ’neath no mortal sky?
757,IX,
758,IX,
759,X,X
760,X,
761,X,"The fire, to which the Magi prayed,"
762,X,"The Aztecs sacrificed and kneeled,"
763,X,"Whose ceremonies now are sealed,"
764,X,"Whose priests are dust, whose people weighed,"
765,X,"Since God permitted such, should man,--"
766,X,"All ignorant of heavenly ends,--"
767,X,"Despise the means, since Earth began,"
768,X,"God works by to perfect His plan,"
769,X,Which through immediate forms ascends
770,X,"Of Nature, lifting, race by race,"
771,X,Man to the beauty of His face?
772,X,Through Nature only we arrive
773,X,"At God: identical with truth,"
774,X,"By periods of repeated youth,"
775,X,Through Nature must the Ages strive;
776,X,"The Epochs, that must purify"
777,X,"Themselves through her experience,"
778,X,"Her knowledge, which each Age lays by"
779,X,To clothe it better for the sky
780,X,In robes of new intelligence
781,X,"Befitting life, that upwardly"
782,X,Approaches ends which none can see.
783,X,
784,X,
785,XI,XI
786,XI,
787,XI,Within the world awake behold
788,XI,A world asleep ... the wildwood shades!
789,XI,With limbs of glimmering coolness lolled
790,XI,Along the purple forest glades:--
791,XI,"Sleep in each unremembering face,"
792,XI,"The sea-worn Greeks knew these of old,"
793,XI,And named “the lotus-eating race.”
794,XI,
795,XI,Within the life asleep I mark
796,XI,"A life awake; a life intense,"
797,XI,That spurs the sap beneath the bark
798,XI,"With tender hints of violence,"
799,XI,"The liquid germs of leaf and bud,"
800,XI,And in the ponderable dark
801,XI,Fulfils the offices of blood.
802,XI,
803,XI,O wiser than Thy works!--behind
804,XI,"Thy works,--who shall behold Thy place?"
805,XI,Beyond the suns whose beams burn blind
806,XI,Before the glory of Thy face!--
807,XI,"Among the least of worlds, shall we"
808,XI,"Presume to give to Thee, defined,"
809,XI,A place and personality!
810,XI,
811,XI,
812,XII,XII
813,XII,
814,XII,"Across the hills, that roll and rise"
815,XII,"Beneath the blue, adoring skies,"
816,XII,"Maturing Beauty by the old,"
817,XII,"Dark forest stands, as might a slave"
818,XII,"Before a Sultan sitting grave,"
819,XII,Grim-gazing from a throne of gold.
820,XII,
821,XII,"Across the hills, that rise and fall,"
822,XII,"I gaze with eyes grown spiritual,"
823,XII,And see the Spirit of the Dew
824,XII,"From out the morn, that stains the mist"
825,XII,"With amber and with amethyst,"
826,XII,"Blown, bubble-bright, along the blue."
827,XII,
828,XII,What king such kingly pomp can show
829,XII,As on the hills the afterglow?
830,XII,"Where ’mid red woods the maples sit,"
831,XII,"Like scarlet-mantled sagamores,"
832,XII,"Who, from their totemed wigwam doors,"
833,XII,"Watch, through red fires, the ghost-dance flit."
834,XII,
835,XII,"At night, as comes the fox, shall come"
836,XII,"The Spirit of the Frost, whose thumb"
837,XII,"Shall squeeze the chestnut burs, and press"
838,XII,Each husk bare; whisper every flower
839,XII,Such tales of death that in an hour
840,XII,It dies of utter happiness.
841,XII,
842,XII,"Until the moon sets I shall walk,"
843,XII,And listen how the woodlands talk
844,XII,Of bygone lovely nights and days:
845,XII,"My soul, made silent intimate"
846,XII,"Of all their sorrow, soon and late"
847,XII,A portion of the autumn haze.
848,XII,
849,XII,
850,XIII,XIII
851,XIII,
852,XIII,What revelations fill with song
853,XIII,The cycles? and to what belong
854,XIII,Life’s far convictions of the light?
855,XIII,"Through which the spirit waxeth strong,"
856,XIII,"The darkling soul surmounts the night,"
857,XIII,"By builded rainbows, to some height"
858,XIII,"Near mountain stars of Truth and Right,"
859,XIII,Beyond the vulture-wing of Wrong?--
860,XIII,
861,XIII,To Nature! who adjusts the deeps
862,XIII,Of her soul’s needs to man’s; and keeps
863,XIII,Such grave response as grief shall hear
864,XIII,When on her heart it sinks and weeps;
865,XIII,"For every gladness, clean and clear"
866,XIII,Its glad reflection lying near--
867,XIII,The wild accord of hope and fear
868,XIII,Which in her inmost bosom sleeps.
869,XIII,
870,XIII,
871,XIV,XIV
872,XIV,
873,XIV,"The mallow, like an Elfland moon,"
874,XIV,Along the stream gleams grottoed gold;
875,XIV,Its bell-shaped blossom seems to hold
876,XIV,All the lost beauty of last June.
877,XIV,"September’s mist haunts, white and cold,"
878,XIV,"The windings of the forest stream,"
879,XIV,As death might haunt a thought or dream.
880,XIV,
881,XIV,"And who with idle words hath stood,"
882,XIV,"With idle thoughts, and gazed into"
883,XIV,"The face of one he loved and knew,"
884,XIV,Dying in all her womanhood?
885,XIV,"No words, but silence, then will do,"
886,XIV,No thoughts but help the heart to hear:
887,XIV,So seems it with the fading year.
888,XIV,
889,XIV,
890,XV,XV
891,XV,
892,XV,The snowy flutter of a hand
893,XV,"Seems beckoning in the morning mist,"
894,XV,And from the mist a jewelled wrist
895,XV,Of dew now waves us a command:
896,XV,"And in the skies, behold! the Land"
897,XV,"Of Far-away-beyond-the-dawn,"
898,XV,"Where, crowned with roses wild and wan,"
899,XV,The Futures of the World speed on.
900,XV,
901,XV,Along the eve a fiery arm
902,XV,"Now points us to the waning west,"
903,XV,"And all the sorrow, that oppressed"
904,XV,"Our hearts once, straight becomes a charm"
905,XV,"Of beauty, whose dim spells transform"
906,XV,"The Present to the Long-ago,"
907,XV,"All grief to joy,--or seeming so,--"
908,XV,We see through thaumaturgic glow.
909,XV,
910,XVI,XVI
911,XVI,
912,XVI,"Pearl-lilac blent with pearly rose,"
913,XVI,"The dawn bloomed slowly out of dusk,--"
914,XVI,As some huge cactus from its husk
915,XVI,Bursts vast a bloom whose chalice glows
916,XVI,A grotto of transmuted dyes;--
917,XVI,"Such wild, auroral light as flows"
918,XVI,On ice-peaks from unearthly skies.
919,XVI,
920,XVI,Dove-purple shifting into shades
921,XVI,"Of opal,--like the tints which dwell"
922,XVI,"With fire in the ocean-shell,--"
923,XVI,The sunset flashed above the glades
924,XVI,Through skies of nacre and of flame;--
925,XVI,Such supernatural light as braids
926,XVI,"Dim coral caves, that have no name."
927,XVI,
928,XVI,
929,XVII,XVII
930,XVII,
931,XVII,Draw from thine eyes the veil that hides
932,XVII,Ideal visions; beckonings
933,XVII,"Of loveliness, whose soul abides"
934,XVII,Beneath the commonplace of things:
935,XVII,No brook within the woodland then
936,XVII,But shows its sparkling god to thee;
937,XVII,Upon the ancient hills no tree
938,XVII,"Whose whispering spirit thou shalt not see,"
939,XVII,Fairer than children born of men.
940,XVII,Refine thy flesh that never hears
941,XVII,"The inner music of all things,--"
942,XVII,"The deaf flesh,--from thy spirit’s ears,"
943,XVII,And list the vaster voice that sings
944,XVII,With pregnant lips unto the Earth:
945,XVII,"Mornings, who hymn with gold the sky,"
946,XVII,To which the eves with gold reply--
947,XVII,The everlasting heavens that cry
948,XVII,The visible psalms of death and birth.
949,XVII,
950,XVII,
951,XVIII,XVIII
952,XVIII,
953,XVIII,The flowers of the fall I seek:
954,XVIII,"The purple aster,--like a gauze"
955,XVIII,"Of pearl,--beneath the nodding haws"
956,XVIII,Or making gay each tangled creek:
957,XVIII,"The hairy, small herb-Robert, lost,--"
958,XVIII,"Yet seen,--among the weeds which crush"
959,XVIII,"Or crowd it, with its bluish blush;"
960,XVIII,"Its rough, low stalk stung red with frost."
961,XVIII,
962,XVIII,"Around the rail-fence, climbing up,"
963,XVIII,"The nightshade hangs rich berries down,--"
964,XVIII,"Clusters of cochineal,--that drown"
965,XVIII,The flowering bind-weed’s pendant cup:
966,XVIII,And where the boggy bottom sets
967,XVIII,"Its burs as breastworks and as tents,"
968,XVIII,"Like bivouacking regiments,"
969,XVIII,The cat-tails stack their bayonets.
970,XVIII,
971,XVIII,From amaranth--in tree and flower--
972,XVIII,To asphodel-in weed and bloom--
973,XVIII,The season swings a magic loom
974,XVIII,Of sun and mist from hour to hour:
975,XVIII,In its wide warp it weaves the dyes
976,XVIII,Of morning’s brilliant blue and gray;
977,XVIII,And crimson through the weft of day
978,XVIII,Flings the wild woof of evening skies.
979,XVIII,
980,XVIII,
981,XIX,XIX
982,XIX,
983,XIX,"What intimations made them wise,"
984,XIX,"The mournful pine, the mighty beech?"
985,XIX,Some strange and esoteric speech--
986,XIX,(Communicated from the skies
987,XIX,In secret whispers)--that invokes
988,XIX,"The boles that sleep within the seeds,"
989,XIX,And out of narrow darkness leads
990,XIX,The vast assemblies of the oaks.
991,XIX,
992,XIX,"Within his knowledge, what one reads"
993,XIX,The poems written by the flowers?
994,XIX,"The sermons, past all speech that’s ours,"
995,XIX,Preached in the gospel of the weeds?--
996,XIX,O eloquence of coloring!
997,XIX,O thoughts of syllabled perfume!
998,XIX,O beauty uttered into bloom!
999,XIX,Teach me your dreams so I may sing!
1000,XIX,
1001,XIX,
1002,XX,XX
1003,XX,
1004,XX,What time the great lobelia fills
1005,XX,The wildwood with the blue of spring--
1006,XX,"And asters, scattered o’er the hills,"
1007,XX,"Bloom, starry-sown, through everything--"
1008,XX,"My fancy takes me wandering,"
1009,XX,"My fancy, clothed in daffodils."
1010,XX,
1011,XX,"In lavender lights, which sleep among"
1012,XX,"The ferns, my heart is at a loss"
1013,XX,To find the love that leads along
1014,XX,Down magic ways of tufted moss--
1015,XX,"Now, like the brook, it calls across,"
1016,XX,"Now, like a bird, it lures with song."
1017,XX,
1018,XX,It leads me to the land which lies
1019,XX,Within a world no man can see;
1020,XX,"Wherein the Elfland cities rise,"
1021,XX,Faint haunts of musk and melody;
1022,XX,That with the butterfly and bee
1023,XX,And congregated flowers are wise.
1024,XX,
1025,XX,
1026,XXI,XXI
1027,XXI,
1028,XXI,"Upon the Earth what hints are rife,"
1029,XXI,Of life when change hath left us still!
1030,XXI,When death within us doth fulfil
1031,XXI,"Its end, whose part is one with life!"
1032,XXI,"What hints, which tell us not alone"
1033,XXI,"Immortal is the spirit, for"
1034,XXI,"Flesh too,--corruption can but mar,--"
1035,XXI,The incorruptible puts on.
1036,XXI,
1037,XXI,The blood but fills a part that’s higher
1038,XXI,"Of color, and pervades all flowers;"
1039,XXI,The brain informs the twinkling hours
1040,XXI,With dreams of resurrected fire;
1041,XXI,The heart performs the function of
1042,XXI,A fragrance; and the countenance
1043,XXI,"Lends new expression to, perchance,"
1044,XXI,The face of beauty that we love.
1045,XXI,
1046,XXI,
1047,XXII,XXII
1048,XXII,
1049,XXII,"Oh, joy, to walk the way that goes"
1050,XXII,Through woods of sweet-gum and of beech!
1051,XXII,"Where, like a ruby left in reach,"
1052,XXII,The berry of the dogwood glows:
1053,XXII,"Or where the bristling hillsides mass,"
1054,XXII,"’Twixt belts of tawny sassafras,"
1055,XXII,Brown shocks of corn in wigwam rows!
1056,XXII,
1057,XXII,"Where, in the hazy morning, runs"
1058,XXII,"The stony branch that pools and drips,"
1059,XXII,The red-haws and the wild-rose hips
1060,XXII,Are strewn like pebbles; and the sun’s
1061,XXII,Own gold seems captured by the weeds;
1062,XXII,"To see, through scintillating seeds,"
1063,XXII,The hunters steal with glimmering guns!
1064,XXII,
1065,XXII,"Oh, joy, to go the path which lies"
1066,XXII,Through woodlands where the trees are tall!
1067,XXII,"Beneath the misty moon of fall,"
1068,XXII,Whose ghostly girdle prophesies
1069,XXII,A morn wind-swept and gray with rain;
1070,XXII,"When, o’er the lonely, leafy lane,"
1071,XXII,"The night-hawk, like a dead leaf, flies!"
1072,XXII,
1073,XXII,To stand within the dewy ring
1074,XXII,"Where pale death smites the boneset blooms,"
1075,XXII,"And everlasting’s flowers, and plumes"
1076,XXII,"Of mint, with aromatic wing!"
1077,XXII,"And hear the creek,--whose sobbing seems"
1078,XXII,"A wild man murmuring in his dreams,--"
1079,XXII,And insect violins that sing!
1080,XXII,Or where the dim persimmon-tree
1081,XXII,"Rains on the path its frosty fruit,"
1082,XXII,"And in the oak the owl doth hoot,"
1083,XXII,"Beneath the moon and mist, to see"
1084,XXII,"The outcast Year come,--Hagar-wise,--"
1085,XXII,"With far-off, melancholy eyes,"
1086,XXII,And lips that thirst for sympathy!
1087,XXII,
1088,XXII,
1089,XXIII,XXIII
1090,XXIII,
1091,XXIII,Along my mind flies suddenly
1092,XXIII,"A wildwood thought that will not die,"
1093,XXIII,"That makes me brother to the bee,"
1094,XXIII,And cousin to the butterfly:
1095,XXIII,"A thought, such as gives perfume to"
1096,XXIII,"The blushes of the bramble-rose,"
1097,XXIII,"And, fixed in quivering crystal, glows"
1098,XXIII,A captive in the prismed dew.
1099,XXIII,
1100,XXIII,"It leads the feet no certain way,"
1101,XXIII,No frequent path of human feet:
1102,XXIII,"Its wild eyes follow me all day,"
1103,XXIII,All day I hear its wild heart beat:
1104,XXIII,And in the night it sings and sighs
1105,XXIII,The songs the winds and waters love;
1106,XXIII,"Its wild heart lying tranced above,"
1107,XXIII,And tranced the wildness of its eyes.
1108,XXIII,
1109,XXIII,
1110,XXIV,XXIV
1111,XXIV,
1112,XXIV,With eyes that seem to ache with tears
1113,XXIV,I look beyond the twilight fields:
1114,XXIV,"The stars swing down their shimmering shields,"
1115,XXIV,And fill the phalanx of their spears.
1116,XXIV,"I can not see, I only know"
1117,XXIV,A flower dies beneath my feet;
1118,XXIV,The fragrance of its death is sweet
1119,XXIV,And bitter as my heart’s own woe.
1120,XXIV,
1121,XXIV,With thoughts that find not what they seek
1122,XXIV,"I question Earth and Heaven, and find"
1123,XXIV,"That they are dark and I am blind,"
1124,XXIV,And in my blindness very weak.
1125,XXIV,"I do not know, I only feel"
1126,XXIV,"Behind all death a purpose stands,"
1127,XXIV,"With hallowed and magnetic hands,"
1128,XXIV,Beneficent and strong to heal.
1129,XXIV,
1130,XXIV,
1131,XXV,XXV
1132,XXV,
1133,XXV,"These, too, shall tell me what my heart,"
1134,XXV,And what my soul desireth:--
1135,XXV,"The flowers, that bloom serene for death,"
1136,XXV,"The stars, that know no mortal part."
1137,XXV,One shall inspire my heart with acts
1138,XXV,Of life so that the death responds;
1139,XXV,One to the soul breathe higher facts
1140,XXV,Of death that shall annul such bonds.
1141,XXV,
1142,XXV,"Sufficient for my love these terms,"
1143,XXV,Beyond my understanding’s scope:
1144,XXV,I merely know all life must grope
1145,XXV,Not downward from its darkling germs.
1146,XXV,Sufficient for my faith is such:
1147,XXV,"That, in the narrow night that binds"
1148,XXV,"The seed, its life shall feel in touch"
1149,XXV,With light above it seeks and finds.
1150,XXV,
1151,XXV,
1152,XXVI,XXVI
1153,XXVI,
1154,XXVI,Beyond the violet-colored hill
1155,XXVI,"The golden, deepening daffodil"
1156,XXVI,Of dusk bloomed on heav’n’s window-sill:
1157,XXVI,"And, drifting west, the crescent moon"
1158,XXVI,Gleamed like a sword of Scanderoon
1159,XXVI,A khedive dropped on floors of gold;
1160,XXVI,"Near which,--one loosened gem that rolled"
1161,XXVI,"Out of the jewelled scimitar,--"
1162,XXVI,Glittered and shone the evening-star.
1163,XXVI,
1164,XXVI,"Behind the trees, where, darkly deep"
1165,XXVI,"As indigo, the shadows sleep,--"
1166,XXVI,As if the Titan world would heap
1167,XXVI,"A throne with purple for its god,"
1168,XXVI,Whose pomp comes with vermilion shod--
1169,XXVI,"The west, ’thwart which the wild-ducks fly,"
1170,XXVI,"Burns, richer than the orient dye"
1171,XXVI,"Phœnician vessels brought from Tyre,"
1172,XXVI,"Deep, murex-stained, with carmine fire."
1173,XXVI,
1174,XXVI,The light dies down; the skies grow gray:
1175,XXVI,"The sear, dark forests sound and sway:"
1176,XXVI,The ashen rain-clouds roll this way.
1177,XXVI,The green grig in the withered weeds
1178,XXVI,"Sings, and the wild snipe seeks the reeds."
1179,XXVI,"With hurling winds,--that seem to wail"
1180,XXVI,"Like Demon Huntsmen,--dark with hail"
1181,XXVI,"And rain, which blot the cabin’s light,"
1182,XXVI,Comes on the wild autumnal night.
1183,XXVI,
1184,XXVI,
1185,XXVII,XXVII
1186,XXVII,
1187,XXVII,"There is a rushing in the woods,"
1188,XXVII,"The autumn-haunted solitudes,"
1189,XXVII,When night comes in with winds that sweep
1190,XXVII,The wild rain from the hills; and reap
1191,XXVII,The roaring harvest of the leaves
1192,XXVII,"With unseen scythes Death stalks behind,"
1193,XXVII,"And Desolation, fierce and blind,"
1194,XXVII,Heaping the storm’s tumultuous sheaves.
1195,XXVII,"There is a sighing in the woods,"
1196,XXVII,"The hills of autumn solitudes,"
1197,XXVII,"When on the night, the winds have strewn"
1198,XXVII,"With crowding clouds, the stormy moon"
1199,XXVII,Bursts like a herald shouting _Cease!_
1200,XXVII,Through darkness o’er a battlefield
1201,XXVII,Of Hell; the splendor of his shield
1202,XXVII,Inscribed with silence and with peace.
1203,XXVII,
1204,XXVII,
1205,XXVIII,XXVIII
1206,XXVIII,
1207,XXVIII,"The storm,--that makes the sky its own,"
1208,XXVIII,"And smites its spirit through Earth’s nerves,"
1209,XXVIII,"And, like an instrument which serves"
1210,XXVIII,High purposes to us unknown
1211,XXVIII,"Of song that knows not that it sings,--"
1212,XXVIII,Itself is all majestic things
1213,XXVIII,Imagination forms or feels;
1214,XXVIII,Itself all wonders it reveals
1215,XXVIII,"To thought, which knows but semblances"
1216,XXVIII,Of such concealed realities.
1217,XXVIII,
1218,XXVIII,"The star, that flames through storm and crowds"
1219,XXVIII,An instant with its utterance
1220,XXVIII,"Of silence and serene romance,"
1221,XXVIII,"And glides again into the clouds,"
1222,XXVIII,Shone for some present end; and filled
1223,XXVIII,A moment’s need as Heaven willed:--
1224,XXVIII,"A thought, some dreamer labored for,"
1225,XXVIII,Immaculate as is a star;
1226,XXVIII,"A hope, some weary watcher read"
1227,XXVIII,Pale in the loved face of his dead.
1228,XXVIII,
1229,XXVIII,
1230,XXIX,XXIX
1231,XXIX,
1232,XXIX,"Towards evening, where the sweet-gum flung"
1233,XXIX,"Its thorny balls among the weeds,"
1234,XXIX,"And where the milkweed’s sleepy seeds,--"
1235,XXIX,"A fairy Feast of Lanterns,--swung;"
1236,XXIX,"The cricket tuned a plaintive lyre,"
1237,XXIX,And o’er the hills the sunset hung
1238,XXIX,A purple parchment scrawled with fire.
1239,XXIX,
1240,XXIX,From silver-blue to amethyst
1241,XXIX,The shadows broadened in the vale;
1242,XXIX,"And, belt by belt, the pearly pale"
1243,XXIX,Aladdin fabric of the mist
1244,XXIX,Stretched its vague exhalation far;
1245,XXIX,"A jewel on an Afrit’s wrist,"
1246,XXIX,One star gemmed sunset’s cinnabar.
1247,XXIX,
1248,XXIX,"Then night drew near, as when, alone,"
1249,XXIX,The heart and soul grow intimate;
1250,XXIX,And on the hills the twilight sate
1251,XXIX,"With shadows, whose wild robes were sown"
1252,XXIX,"With dreams and whispers--dreams, that led"
1253,XXIX,"The heart once with love’s monotone,"
1254,XXIX,And whispers of the living dead.
1255,XXIX,
1256,XXIX,
1257,XXX,XXX
1258,XXX,
1259,XXX,Of life and of eternity
1260,XXX,These are the dreams that came to me:
1261,XXX,The one:--A whitened whirl of sea;
1262,XXX,"A gallows beetling through the rains,"
1263,XXX,"And, tossing in its rusty chains,"
1264,XXX,Carrion upon the gallows-tree:
1265,XXX,Gaunt ravens swarm above and tear
1266,XXX,Long strips from shrivelled skin and hair:
1267,XXX,A ship hurls pounding on the rocks:
1268,XXX,Wild minute-guns boom through the spume
1269,XXX,And crashing surf: out of the gloom
1270,XXX,The strangled dead leers down and mocks.
1271,XXX,
1272,XXX,"An incorporeal solitude,"
1273,XXX,"Which darkness out of darkness hewed,"
1274,XXX,The other dream: Enormous deeps
1275,XXX,"Of naught, where ancient Silence sleeps,"
1276,XXX,The eldest of Heav’n’s Titan brood:--
1277,XXX,"In unilluminated night,"
1278,XXX,"Vast and insufferable white,"
1279,XXX,"A summit soars: its light, which dyes"
1280,XXX,"Not darkness, of itself is born:"
1281,XXX,"Around its splendor, as in scorn,"
1282,XXX,"Night’s dark, defiant chaos lies."
1283,XXX,
1284,XXX,
1285,XXXI,XXXI
1286,XXXI,
1287,XXXI,"Past midnight, gathering from the west,"
1288,XXXI,"With rolling rain the storm came on,"
1289,XXXI,"And tore and tossed until the dawn,"
1290,XXXI,Like some dark demon of unrest:
1291,XXXI,The stairways creaked! the chimneys boomed;
1292,XXXI,I heard the wild leaves blown about
1293,XXXI,The windy windows; and the shout
1294,XXXI,Of forests that the storm had doomed.
1295,XXXI,
1296,XXXI,"I listened, and remembered how"
1297,XXXI,On yesterday I went alone
1298,XXXI,A sunlit path through fields o’ergrown
1299,XXXI,"With sumac brakes, turned crimson now;"
1300,XXXI,Where asters strung blue pearls and white
1301,XXXI,Beside the goldenrod’s soft ruff;
1302,XXXI,"Where thistles, silvery puff on puff,"
1303,XXXI,Danced many a twinkling witch’s-light.
1304,XXXI,
1305,XXXI,Her joy the Autumn uttered so
1306,XXXI,To skies where gold and azure blent;
1307,XXXI,Now storm is the embodiment
1308,XXXI,Of all her utterance of woe:
1309,XXXI,"The two within me so abide,"
1310,XXXI,"That of the two my mind partakes,--"
1311,XXXI,"As one, who walks asleep, awakes,"
1312,XXXI,"Walks on and thinks, “To-night I died.”"
1313,XXXI,
1314,XXXI,
1315,XXXII,XXXII
1316,XXXII,
1317,XXXII,What sympathies of Heaven and Earth
1318,XXXII,The human ego enters in!
1319,XXXII,The universal stain of sin
1320,XXXII,"Which qualifies it from its birth,"
1321,XXXII,Denying it their highest worth.
1322,XXXII,There is a parallel of kin
1323,XXXII,"’Twixt earth and man, that dignifies"
1324,XXXII,Endeavor with such sympathies.
1325,XXXII,
1326,XXXII,The all mysterious wisdom waits
1327,XXXII,"In mountain, wood, and waterfall,"
1328,XXXII,"Sky, rock and sea, to hear the call"
1329,XXXII,Of something--firmer than the Fates--
1330,XXXII,Deep in the soul it elevates;
1331,XXXII,And to the splendor of the All
1332,XXXII,"Advances, through the night’s immense,"
1333,XXXII,The spirit of experience.
1334,XXXII,"So think I now while, long and loud,"
1335,XXXII,"The wind its maniac music beats,"
1336,XXXII,And storm a madman’s song repeats
1337,XXXII,To echoes in the rushing cloud;
1338,XXXII,"While all the world to wrath is vowed,"
1339,XXXII,And nothing conquers or defeats
1340,XXXII,The darkness and the rain that raves
1341,XXXII,Above the all-unheeding graves.
1342,XXXII,
1343,XXXII,
1344,XXXIII,XXXIII
1345,XXXIII,
1346,XXXIII,All night the rain-gusts shook the leaves
1347,XXXIII,Around my window; and the blast
1348,XXXIII,"Rumbled the flickering flue, and fast"
1349,XXXIII,The storm streamed from the dripping eaves.
1350,XXXIII,As if--’neath skies gone mad with fear--
1351,XXXIII,"The witches’ Sabboth galloped past,"
1352,XXXIII,The forests leapt like startled deer.
1353,XXXIII,
1354,XXXIII,All night I heard the sweeping sleet;
1355,XXXIII,"And when the morning came, as slow"
1356,XXXIII,"As pale affliction, with the woe"
1357,XXXIII,"Of all the world dragged at her feet,"
1358,XXXIII,No spear of purple shattered through
1359,XXXIII,The dark-gray of the east; no bow
1360,XXXIII,"Of gold, whose arrows cleft the blue."
1361,XXXIII,
1362,XXXIII,"But rain, that whipped the windows; filled"
1363,XXXIII,The spouts with rushing; and around
1364,XXXIII,"The garden stamped, and sowed the ground"
1365,XXXIII,With limbs and leaves; the wood-pool filled
1366,XXXIII,With overgurgling.--Bleak and cold
1367,XXXIII,"The fields looked, where the foot-path wound"
1368,XXXIII,Through teasel and bur-marigold....
1369,XXXIII,
1370,XXXIII,Yet there is kindness in such days
1371,XXXIII,"Of gloom, that doth console regret"
1372,XXXIII,"With sympathy of tears, which wet"
1373,XXXIII,Old eyes that watch the back-log blaze--
1374,XXXIII,"A kindness, alien to the deep"
1375,XXXIII,Glad blue of sunny days that let
1376,XXXIII,No thought in of the lives that weep.
1377,XXXIII,
1378,XXXIII,
1379,XXXIV,XXXIV
1380,XXXIV,
1381,XXXIV,"This dawn, through which the Autumn glowers,--"
1382,XXXIV,"As might a face within our sleep,"
1383,XXXIV,"With stone-gray eyes that weep and weep,"
1384,XXXIV,"And wet brows bound with sodden flowers,--"
1385,XXXIV,Is sunset to some sister land;
1386,XXXIV,A land of ruins and of palms;
1387,XXXIV,"Rich sunset, crimson with long calms,--"
1388,XXXIV,"Whose burning belt low mountains bar,--"
1389,XXXIV,That sees some brown Rebecca stand
1390,XXXIV,Beside a well the camel-band
1391,XXXIV,Winds down to ’neath the evening-star.
1392,XXXIV,
1393,XXXIV,"O sunset, sister to this dawn!"
1394,XXXIV,"O dawn, whose face is turned away!"
1395,XXXIV,"Who gazest not upon this day,"
1396,XXXIV,But back upon the day that’s gone!
1397,XXXIV,"Enamored so of loveliness,"
1398,XXXIV,"The retrospect of what thou wast,"
1399,XXXIV,"Oh, to thyself the present trust!"
1400,XXXIV,And as thy past make beautiful
1401,XXXIV,"With hues, that never can grow less!"
1402,XXXIV,Waiting thy pleasure to express
1403,XXXIV,"New beauty, lest the world grow dull."
1404,XXXIV,
1405,XXXIV,
1406,XXXV,XXXV
1407,XXXV,
1408,XXXV,At daybreak from the woodland come
1409,XXXV,Echoes of hunting; or the chop
1410,XXXV,"Of some far woodman’s axe, that cleaves"
1411,XXXV,"The tingling oak, whose russet leaves"
1412,XXXV,Drop slowly where the white chips drop:
1413,XXXV,"The air is fragrant with the loam,"
1414,XXXV,"Where, through the mists of steaming gold,"
1415,XXXV,The sudden sun strikes fold on fold.
1416,XXXV,"Out of the window, filmed with fog,"
1417,XXXV,I look into the wreck which was
1418,XXXV,"The kitchen-garden, drenched with rain;"
1419,XXXV,Among the death I mark again
1420,XXXV,One blue convolvulus--that draws
1421,XXXV,"A gray vignette along a log,"
1422,XXXV,With pencilled tendrils washed and wan--
1423,XXXV,The garden-story’s colophon.
1424,XXXV,
1425,XXXV,
1426,XXXVI,XXXVI
1427,XXXVI,
1428,XXXVI,"More storm than calm, less gold than gray,"
1429,XXXVI,"Along the years our lives must tread,"
1430,XXXVI,"Makes sad the scenes around our way,"
1431,XXXVI,Makes grave the heavens overhead:
1432,XXXVI,"For on life’s storied page, behold,"
1433,XXXVI,Are adumbrations of the dead!
1434,XXXVI,The neutral tint Time’s fingers lay
1435,XXXVI,Around a tale that’s never told.
1436,XXXVI,
1437,XXXVI,"Time writes with sunshine less than rain,"
1438,XXXVI,"With starlight less than mist, the scroll--"
1439,XXXVI,A thousand memories of pain
1440,XXXVI,To one of joy--of his own soul:
1441,XXXVI,The golden hues of life occur
1442,XXXVI,"In his dim palimpsest, whose whole"
1443,XXXVI,"Death scrawls with dusty lines again,"
1444,XXXVI,Making of all a leaden blur.
1445,XXXVI,
1446,XXXVI,
1447,XXXVII,XXXVII
1448,XXXVII,
1449,XXXVII,"Down in the woods a sorcerer,"
1450,XXXVII,"Out of rank rain and death, distils,--"
1451,XXXVII,"Through chill alembics of the air,--"
1452,XXXVII,Aromas that brood everywhere
1453,XXXVII,Among the dingles of the hills:
1454,XXXVII,The bitter myrrh of dead leaves fills
1455,XXXVII,Wet valleys (where the gaunt weeds bleach)
1456,XXXVII,With sodden scents of wood decay;--
1457,XXXVII,As if a spirit all the day
1458,XXXVII,Sat breathing softly ’neath the beech.
1459,XXXVII,
1460,XXXVII,"With other eyes I see her flit,"
1461,XXXVII,"The wood-witch of the wild perfumes,"
1462,XXXVII,"Among her sleepy owls,--that sit,"
1463,XXXVII,"A fluffy white, in crescent-lit"
1464,XXXVII,Dim glens and opalescent glooms:--
1465,XXXVII,"Where, for her magic, buds and blooms"
1466,XXXVII,"Mysterious perfumes, while she stands,"
1467,XXXVII,"A fragrant shadow, summoning"
1468,XXXVII,"The eery odors that take wing,"
1469,XXXVII,"Like bubbles, from her rainy hands."
1470,XXXVII,
1471,XXXVII,
1472,XXXVIII,XXXVIII
1473,XXXVIII,
1474,XXXVIII,"With leagues of fog, which showed the sun"
1475,XXXVIII,"An agate-red without a ray,"
1476,XXXVIII,"And drowned the world in ghostly gray,"
1477,XXXVIII,"The chill, autumnal day begun:"
1478,XXXVIII,"A phantom in the mist, a run"
1479,XXXVIII,Foamed over phantom ledges lone
1480,XXXVIII,"In forests that seemed far away,"
1481,XXXVIII,Wild woods of immaterial stone.
1482,XXXVIII,
1483,XXXVIII,With horses saffron to the knees
1484,XXXVIII,A country cart drove through the fog;
1485,XXXVIII,Its creaking wheels grown one great clog
1486,XXXVIII,"Of clay, and clanking swingletrees:"
1487,XXXVIII,Its smothered rumble did not cease
1488,XXXVIII,"Till hidden in the woodland mist,"
1489,XXXVIII,"Where, leaning on his fresh-cut log,"
1490,XXXVIII,The muffled woodman blew his fist.
1491,XXXVIII,
1492,XXXVIII,Another world I wander in
1493,XXXVIII,Of unlaid ghosts and dreams unfled;
1494,XXXVIII,A twilight world of drowsy-head
1495,XXXVIII,"And mystery, built figment-thin"
1496,XXXVIII,Between the worlds of death and sin:
1497,XXXVIII,"Where dim and strange and incomplete,"
1498,XXXVIII,"And substanceless, seem things not dead,"
1499,XXXVIII,And sorrowful as dimly sweet.
1500,XXXVIII,
1501,XXXVIII,
1502,XXXIX,XXXIX
1503,XXXIX,
1504,XXXIX,Among the woods they call to me--
1505,XXXIX,The lights that haunt the strand and stream;
1506,XXXIX,Voices of such white ecstasy
1507,XXXIX,As moves with hushed lips through a dream:
1508,XXXIX,"They stand in nimbused radiances,"
1509,XXXIX,Or flash with glittering limbs across
1510,XXXIX,"Their golden shadows on the moss,"
1511,XXXIX,Or slip in silver through the trees.
1512,XXXIX,
1513,XXXIX,What love can give the heart in me
1514,XXXIX,More hope and exaltation than
1515,XXXIX,The hand of light that tips the tree
1516,XXXIX,And beckons far from marts of man?
1517,XXXIX,That reaches foamy fingers through
1518,XXXIX,"The broken ripple, and replies"
1519,XXXIX,With sparkling speech of lips and eyes
1520,XXXIX,To souls who seek and still pursue.
1521,XXXIX,
1522,XXXIX,
1523,XL,XL
1524,XL,
1525,XL,"Oh, bright the day, and calm and cool"
1526,XL,"With clouds, like cotton-fields that swoon"
1527,XL,Beneath the silver summer moon;
1528,XL,"And, quiet as a forest pool,--"
1529,XL,"Where Autumn sits and combs her locks,"
1530,XL,"And strews with rainbow leaves and roon,--"
1531,XL,The shadows rest upon the rocks.
1532,XL,
1533,XL,The sun pours airy amber on
1534,XL,"The withered wood-ways, where the late"
1535,XL,Green-crickets’ shell-like wings vibrate:
1536,XL,"And, fainter than lost lines of dawn,"
1537,XL,"The fields shine labyrinthed with rays,"
1538,XL,"With gossamer-webs, that imitate"
1539,XL,"Cloud-figments, or a splintered haze."
1540,XL,
1541,XL,"Beyond the yarrow’s meekness now,"
1542,XL,"Wood-sorrel’s lowliness, and shy"
1543,XL,"Hepatica’s humility,"
1544,XL,The Year is grown: makes brave her brow
1545,XL,"With crowning crimson of the lands,"
1546,XL,"And robes her limbs in cardinal dye,"
1547,XL,And by the lonely waters stands.

1551,XLI,
1552,XLI,"Pure thought-creations of the mind,"
1553,XLI,"Within the circle of the soul,--"
1554,XLI,The emanations that control
1555,XLI,"Life to its God-predestined goal,--"
1556,XLI,Are spirit shapes no flesh can bind:
1557,XLI,Within the soul desire ordains
1558,XLI,Achievements which the will constrains;
1559,XLI,"And far above us, on before,"
1560,XLI,"Our thoughts--a beautiful people--soar,"
1561,XLI,To wait us on celestial plains.
1562,XLI,
1563,XLI,So Nature pours her thoughts in forms--
1564,XLI,Realities we move among--
1565,XLI,"Of fragrance, color, and of song;"
1566,XLI,"Sense emanations which belong,"
1567,XLI,"Invisible, to spiritual charms;"
1568,XLI,The sensuous substance of her thought
1569,XLI,From immaterial matter wrought--
1570,XLI,"Matter, which death can not annul,"
1571,XLI,"That constitutes the Beautiful,"

1576,XLII,
1577,XLII,"Give me the streams, that counterfeit"
1578,XLII,The twilight of autumnal skies;
1579,XLII,"The silent, shadowy waters, lit"
1580,XLII,With fire like a woman’s eyes!
1581,XLII,"Slow waters that, in autumn, glass"
1582,XLII,"The scarlet-strewn and golden grass,"
1583,XLII,And drink the sunset’s tawny dyes.
1584,XLII,
1585,XLII,"Give me the pools, that lie among"
1586,XLII,"The centuried forests! give me those,"
1587,XLII,"Deep, dim, and sad as shadows hung"
1588,XLII,Dark ’neath the sunset’s sombre rose:
1589,XLII,"Still pools, in whose vague mirrors look--"
1590,XLII,Like ragged gipsies round a book
1591,XLII,Of magic--trees in wild repose.
1592,XLII,
1593,XLII,"No quiet thing, or innocent,"
1594,XLII,"Of water, earth, or air shall please"
1595,XLII,My soul now: but the violent
1596,XLII,Between the sunset and the trees:
1597,XLII,"The fierce, the splendid, and intense,"
1598,XLII,"Like love matures in innocence,"
1599,XLII,"Like mighty music, give me these!"
1600,XLII,
1601,XLII,
1602,XLIII,XLIII
1603,XLIII,
1604,XLIII,As Nature in herself resolves
1605,XLIII,"All parts of beauty to one whole,"
1606,XLIII,And from the perfect whole evolves
1607,XLIII,The high ideas that control
1608,XLIII,"Advancement, till the time be ripe"
1609,XLIII,"To doff disguise and, type by type,"
1610,XLIII,Reveal the emanated soul:
1611,XLIII,
1612,XLIII,So should the Beautiful in man
1613,XLIII,Evolve the best in him; to be
1614,XLIII,The lofty purpose life began
1615,XLIII,For ends which only Heaven can see--
1616,XLIII,"The absolute, that sees how thought"
1617,XLIII,Its high ideal’s shape hath wrought
1618,XLIII,To be its far affinity.
1619,XLIII,
1620,XLIII,
1621,XLIV,XLIV
1622,XLIV,
1623,XLIV,I hold them here; they are no less;
1624,XLIV,I see them still--the changeful grays
1625,XLIV,Of threatening skies above the haze--
1626,XLIV,"My hills! that roll long, murmuring miles"
1627,XLIV,"Of savage-painted wilderness,"
1628,XLIV,On which the saddened sunlight smiles;
1629,XLIV,"Or, like a fallen angel’s frown--"
1630,XLIV,Severe beneath a burning crown--
1631,XLIV,"Through sombre silvers, that oppress"
1632,XLIV,"With clouds its glory, rushes down."
1633,XLIV,
1634,XLIV,I hear the coming storm again;
1635,XLIV,Again behold the streaming clouds;
1636,XLIV,The autumn wind drives down and crowds
1637,XLIV,"Wild sibylline voices through the leaves,"
1638,XLIV,To whispering octaves of the rain:
1639,XLIV,"A wilder wind, vibrating, heaves"
1640,XLIV,Vast music through the rolling woods--
1641,XLIV,"Upon my soul the grandeur broods,"
1642,XLIV,"Like some archangel’s trumpet strain,"
1643,XLIV,Or organ-pomp that sweeps all moods.

1646,XLV,XLV
1647,XLV,
1648,XLV,Such circumstance of passionate praise

1650,XLV,No pomp of worship or of grace
1651,XLV,"Like Nature’s, standing face to face"
1652,XLV,"With God, whose inmost thought she reads:"
1653,XLV,"No multitude of words she needs,"
1654,XLV,Since all her worship is one word
1655,XLV,"Of love, like that creation heard."
1656,XLV,
1657,XLV,God leaves progression in her care:
1658,XLV,Through her it must materialize--
1659,XLV,"Our Mother! with strong lips of prayer,"
1660,XLV,"Majestic-browed, with hands that bare"
1661,XLV,Immortal fire from the skies:
1662,XLV,"Who looks, with no evasive eyes,"
1663,XLV,"Through life, and, smiling, sees beneath"
1664,XLV,"The beautiful, dark eyes of death."

1671,XLVI,"In war-paint and the eagle-plume,"
1672,XLVI,"Among their wampumed warriors,"
1673,XLVI,When council fires burn red and set
1674,XLVI,"On stoic cheeks the battle-bloom,"
1675,XLVI,That puff the smoking calumet.
1676,XLVI,
1677,XLVI,Beneath the stars and hunter’s-moon
1678,XLVI,"The frost spreads ghostly pearls, that glance"
1679,XLVI,Like dewy jewels in the dance
1680,XLVI,That whirls on fairied hills of June:
1681,XLVI,The night is calm; no luminous veil
1682,XLVI,Conceals the spirit utterance
1683,XLVI,"Of her dark beauty, pure and pale."
1684,XLVI,

1686,XLVII,XLVII
1687,XLVII,
1688,XLVII,"I sat alone with song and sleep,"
1689,XLVII,And in the singing silence heard
1690,XLVII,The darkness draw from forth the deep
1691,XLVII,"With star on star, like word on word:"
1692,XLVII,A sound of twilight and swift shades
1693,XLVII,"Materializing into night,"
1694,XLVII,"Who hears the breaking waves of light,"
1695,XLVII,And towards the shores of morning wades.
1696,XLVII,
1697,XLVII,"I sat alone with dawn and death,"
1698,XLVII,And in my waking vision saw
1699,XLVII,"The form of silence, like a breath"
1700,XLVII,"Of bodiless beauty and of awe,"
1701,XLVII,Whose sibyl eyes said unto me
1702,XLVII,"The things the sealed lips would not word,"
1703,XLVII,That eons of the stars record
1704,XLVII,In volumes of eternity.
1705,XLVII,

1707,XLVIII,XLVIII
1708,XLVIII,
1709,XLVIII,"The dead gold of the marybud,"
1710,XLVIII,"The dusky, tarnished orange-red"
1711,XLVIII,"Of zinnias, flush the flower-bed,"
1712,XLVIII,Like frosty autumn gleams that scud
1713,XLVIII,Tempestuous dusks and stormy dawns
1714,XLVIII,Above the wind-dishevelled lawns.
1715,XLVIII,
1716,XLVIII,"With tired eyes and heart grown grave,"
1717,XLVIII,"And thoughts more weary than the night,"
1718,XLVIII,"I watch the dwindling of the light,"
1719,XLVIII,"And hear the rising night-winds rave,"
1720,XLVIII,"As one might hear, when half asleep,"
1721,XLVIII,Another self make moan and weep.

1726,XLIX,"Behold, the winds have speech and speak!"
1727,XLIX,The stars of heaven are eloquent!
1728,XLIX,A voice within us bids us seek
1729,XLIX,The word the flowers say in scent:
1730,XLIX,The paraclete encouragement
1731,XLIX,Of beauty that the burning scrolls
1732,XLIX,Of eve and morning give our souls.
1733,XLIX,
1734,XLIX,There is one language of the mart;
1735,XLIX,Another of the rocks and trees:
1736,XLIX,Unrest and greed is this one’s heart;
1737,XLIX,The other’s heart is rest and peace:
1738,XLIX,Within our souls we know of these;
1739,XLIX,"They lead us by the myths we love,"
1740,XLIX,Yet never see and know not of.

1745,L,When thorn-tree copses still were bare
1746,L,And black along the turbid brook;
1747,L,When catkined willows blurred and shook
1748,L,Great tawny tangles in the air;
1749,L,"In bottomlands, the first thaw makes"
1750,L,"An oozy bog, beneath the trees,"
1751,L,"Prophetic of the spring that wakes,"
1752,L,Sang the sonorous hylodes.
1753,L,
1754,L,"Now that wild winds have stripped the thorn,"
1755,L,And clogged with leaves the forest-creek;
1756,L,"Now that the woods look brown and bleak,"
1757,L,And webs are frosty white at morn;
1758,L,"At night beneath the spectral sky,"
1759,L,A far foreboding cry I hear--
1760,L,The wild-fowl calling as they fly?

1768,LI,"Beyond the Spirit of Light she hates,"
1769,LI,Speeds like a ghost before a ghost
1770,LI,Upon the twilight-haunted coast
1771,LI,Of death between the seas of sleep:
1772,LI,Her lips are dumb with awe that hears;
1773,LI,"And in her eyes, that never weep,"
1774,LI,Is anguish of eternal tears.
1775,LI,
1776,LI,Out of the terrible gulfs of God
1777,LI,"Into God’s awful deeps she goes,"
1778,LI,Revealing in heaven’s gold and rose
1779,LI,The ways her footsteps tread and trod
1780,LI,From period to period:
1781,LI,Her lips are still--for she hath heard
1782,LI,God’s voice that moves the universe:
1783,LI,Her eyes are sad beyond the word--
1784,LI,The eyes of Vastness gazed in hers.

1787,LII,LII
1788,LII,
1789,LII,"And still my soul holds phantom tryst,"

1792,LII,"When all the night is moon and mist,"

1794,LII,"I kiss dear lips that death hath kissed,"
1795,LII,"And look in eyes no man may see,"
1796,LII,Filled with a love long lost to me.
1797,LII,
1798,LII,I hear the night-wind’s ghostly glove
1799,LII,Flutter the window: then the knob
1800,LII,"Of some dark door turn, with a sob"
1801,LII,As when love comes to gaze on love
1802,LII,Who lies pale-coffined in a room:
1803,LII,And then the iron gallop of
1804,LII,"The storm, who rides outside, his plume"
1805,LII,Sweeping the night with dread and gloom.
1806,LII,
1807,LII,"So fancy takes my mind, and paints"
1808,LII,"The darkness with eidolon light,"
1809,LII,And writes the deads’ romance in white
1810,LII,On the dim Evening of All Saints:
1811,LII,Unheard the hissing nuts; the clink
1812,LII,"Of falling coals, whose shadow faints"
1813,LII,"Around me where I sit and think,"
1814,LII,Borne far beyond the actual’s brink.

1822,LIII,"God, in His wisdom, doth conceal:"
1823,LIII,"Reflections of another birth,"
1824,LIII,"Existent with and kin to ours,"
1825,LIII,Announcing through supernal powers

1827,LIII,
1828,LIII,"In Nature I perceive it, too,"
1829,LIII,This other life I can not see:
1830,LIII,"A spirit sparkles in the dew,"
1831,LIII,The trees have tongues that speak to me:
1832,LIII,"That Earth is green and Heaven, blue,"
1833,LIII,The sight alone may satisfy;
1834,LIII,The soul sees with a different eye

1844,LIV,And on the Earth fall shadowings;
1845,LIV,And prophecies of near decay;
1846,LIV,"But, lovelier than a dead delight,"
1847,LIV,The starlit skies of glittering gray.
1848,LIV,Still shall the Season claim and keep
1849,LIV,Her wild-girl beauty; doubly deep
1850,LIV,The purport of her dreams shall rise
1851,LIV,"Out of her heart into her eyes,"
1852,LIV,Till very dreaming makes her weep;
1853,LIV,"And death, with pale, pure lips and arms,"

1867,LV,

1883,LVI,She makes a passion of despair
1884,LVI,"And, Rachel-like, with eyes wept red,"
1885,LVI,Refuses to be comforted.
1886,LVI,
1887,LVI,"To funeral torches for the Year,"
1888,LVI,"Tree by tall tree, the forests turned;"
1889,LVI,"Then, fiery coals in ashes, burned"
1890,LVI,A few last leaves among the sear;
1891,LVI,"Where, robed in purple pomp, she yearned"

1902,LVII,This spirit of the solitude
1903,LVII,"Named Meditation; thought-imbued,"
1904,LVII,On whom all beauty ministers;

1907,LVII,Knowing their hearts are understood.
1908,LVII,
1909,LVII,The holy harp she holds and smites
1910,LVII,Was tuned among concordant spheres;
1911,LVII,The heavenly pen with which she writes
1912,LVII,Was dipped in angel smiles and tears:
1913,LVII,Between her eyebrows and her eyes
1914,LVII,The starry stamp of silence lies;
1915,LVII,"Between her symboled lips and tongue,"
1916,LVII,The song the stars of morning sung:

1928,LVIII,"Moaning among the windy graves,"
1929,LVIII,"The Indian squaws lament the braves,"

1936,LVIII,"Bear not too hard, is all I ask,"

1947,LIX,"Of dead, despairing of the morn,"
1948,LIX,Calls through illimitable night
1949,LIX,The wailing words no thing may know;
1950,LIX,Deep in her memory-haunted sight
1951,LIX,"Sleeps no remembrance of delight,"
1952,LIX,But death and everlasting woe.
1953,LIX,
1954,LIX,No wind! a voice whose sense is form;
1955,LIX,A form whose sense is but a sound;
1956,LIX,"That smites the constant skies around,"
1957,LIX,And shakes the steadfast hills with storm:
1958,LIX,Adown life’s desolate deep it cries
1959,LIX,The words death’s sterile lips must learn
1960,LIX,"From Law, the Law that never dies--"
1961,LIX,"Such utterless, wild speech as sighs"

1972,LX,"No morn like yesterday’s! whose mouth,"
1973,LX,"A cool carnation, from the south"

1976,LX,Cerulean silver floors of dawn.
1977,LX,

1983,LX,Unlovely since unloved; and chilled

2256,THE MOATED GRANGE,And tag the toadstool’s spongy brim
2257,THE MOATED GRANGE,"With points of mist; and, orbing, dim"

4231,THE SYMPHONY,Like the huge heart of Ocean; pulsings wove
4232,THE SYMPHONY,"Of deep, æolian thunders: and my soul"
4233,THE SYMPHONY,"Seems wafted far beneath the sea of seas,"
4234,THE SYMPHONY,"To chasms and caves of crystal, ocean-carved,"

4236,THE SYMPHONY,"Deep, dolorous seas, that throb like some vast harp,"
4237,THE SYMPHONY,"Wild, oceanic, and with stormy sighs"
4238,THE SYMPHONY,Of labyrinthine music shake the world.
4239,THE SYMPHONY,"One with the tumult,--under circling tiers"
4240,THE SYMPHONY,"Of beryl and chrysoberyl, splashed and hung"
4241,THE SYMPHONY,"Pale with pelagian gems and feathery shells,"
4242,THE SYMPHONY,"And spars of moony radiance,--on I drift,"
4243,THE SYMPHONY,"A voice ’mid voices, chord amid the chords,"
4244,THE SYMPHONY,"A wave, a wild vibration of the strain,"
4245,THE SYMPHONY,"Part of the ray, the rose of melody,"
4246,THE SYMPHONY,An utterance amid that utterance
4247,THE SYMPHONY,"Of choral harmony: now rising up,--"
4248,THE SYMPHONY,As ’twere a spire of silver symphony
4249,THE SYMPHONY,Blown from a reed of hollow pearl and fire
4250,THE SYMPHONY,"By some still spirit dwelling within the moon,--"
4251,THE SYMPHONY,To the vast vault of echoes: dying now
4252,THE SYMPHONY,"Down to the underworld of silence, deep"
4253,THE SYMPHONY,"With wild, unburdened sobbings; then, once more,"
4254,THE SYMPHONY,"Sweeping the vault with tumult, like a bird"
4255,THE SYMPHONY,"With maddened wings, that beat and bleed in vain"
4256,THE SYMPHONY,"Against the bars; or like the human soul,"
4257,THE SYMPHONY,"Oppressed and bulked within its cage of clay,"
4258,THE SYMPHONY,That longs and strains to burst its bonds and soar.
4259,THE SYMPHONY,
4260,THE SYMPHONY,Then tones that shape before my inner sight
4261,THE SYMPHONY,"The moonlit gardens of the spirit, Sleep,"
4262,THE SYMPHONY,Far on a star man’s eyes have never seen:
4263,THE SYMPHONY,"White Sleep, who leads me ’mid her poppies, weighed"
4264,THE SYMPHONY,With dewy slumber; from whose chalices
4265,THE SYMPHONY,She culls white dreams to lay on human hearts
4266,THE SYMPHONY,In pearly clusters sparkling now with tears
4267,THE SYMPHONY,And now with smiles; the blossoms of her soul.
4268,THE SYMPHONY,"She, on her shadowy pinions, winging high,"
4269,THE SYMPHONY,"Bears me from pole to pole of her white star,"
4270,THE SYMPHONY,"The continents like clouds beneath our feet,"
4271,THE SYMPHONY,"The seas like mists; then drops me, meteor-like,"
4272,THE SYMPHONY,"A million leagues, through all the gulfs of God,"
4273,THE SYMPHONY,"Down, down to Earth again; a sound of stars,"
4274,THE SYMPHONY,"Streaming from burning orbits into night,"
4275,THE SYMPHONY,"About my soul, about my soul like fire."
4276,THE SYMPHONY,
4277,THE SYMPHONY,"Oh, then what agony and bitter woe,"
4278,THE SYMPHONY,"Regret and noise of desolation, vast"
4279,THE SYMPHONY,As when all that one loves is torn away
4280,THE SYMPHONY,Forever with “farewell forevermore”!
4281,THE SYMPHONY,"Oh, strife and panic of impending doom!"
4282,THE SYMPHONY,Wherein rush by pale brows with tresses torn;
4283,THE SYMPHONY,"Pale faces browed with raven, rended hair,"
4284,THE SYMPHONY,"That cringe or fly before the wrath of God,"
4285,THE SYMPHONY,"Or stand white-lifted to the bolts of Heaven,"
4286,THE SYMPHONY,"Ploughing the tempest, chasmed with torrent flame"
4287,THE SYMPHONY,As ’twere with rocking earthquake. All around
4288,THE SYMPHONY,"Ruin and terror, moans and awful eyes,"
4289,THE SYMPHONY,"Fierce, moveless eyes that seem to curse their God:"
4290,THE SYMPHONY,"Then sounds, as ’twere, of burning tears that fall"
4291,THE SYMPHONY,Through blinding blackness: then--long thunder strokes
4292,THE SYMPHONY,As of a bell that tolls “’Tis Judgment Day!”
4293,THE SYMPHONY,"Sonorous bell-beats heard through night and storm,"
4294,THE SYMPHONY,O’er hands high lifted as it were in prayer
4295,THE SYMPHONY,"Or battling with their doom: still tolling on,"
4296,THE SYMPHONY,The knell of dying Earth and of the Dawn;
4297,THE SYMPHONY,"The Dawn that will not break, that comes no more;"
4298,THE SYMPHONY,"Never again; the beautiful, wild Dawn,"
4299,THE SYMPHONY,"The young, the holy, radiant and wonderful,"
4300,THE SYMPHONY,"First born of Heaven’s children, daughters of Light:"
4301,THE SYMPHONY,"The Rose of God, the dream and youth of Day,"
4302,THE SYMPHONY,"Whom Night hath slain and Darkness laid away,"
4303,THE SYMPHONY,"Crying, “No more shall she awake the world!"
4304,THE SYMPHONY,"No more! no more!--The Dawn, aurora-wreathed,"
4305,THE SYMPHONY,"Lies dead with all her flow’rs! and Death and I,"

4709,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Deep over deep;
4710,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Each star a point of light
4711,THE LIGHT AND LARK,In God’s high keep.
4712,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4713,THE LIGHT AND LARK,In God’s?--Perhaps.--Of such
4714,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"We can not tell,"
4715,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Who shrink--and is it much?--
4716,THE LIGHT AND LARK,To say farewell.
4717,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4718,THE LIGHT AND LARK,_There_ ’tis the dawn and lark:
4719,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"_Here_ ’tis the wail,"
4720,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"Sobbed through the ceaseless dark,"
4721,THE LIGHT AND LARK,O’ the nightingale.
4722,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4723,THE LIGHT AND LARK,But what were all this worth
4724,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"To thee or me,"

4726,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Eternity?
4727,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4728,THE LIGHT AND LARK,God gives us life to keep.--
4729,THE LIGHT AND LARK,And what hath life?--
4730,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"Love, faith, and care, and sleep,"
4731,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Where dreams are rife.
4732,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4733,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Death’s sleep! whose shadows start
4734,THE LIGHT AND LARK,The tears in eyes
4735,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"Of Love, who breaks his heart,"
4736,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Despairs and dies.
4737,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4738,THE LIGHT AND LARK,And faith is never given
4739,THE LIGHT AND LARK,"Without some care,"
4740,THE LIGHT AND LARK,Perhaps that leads to Heaven
4741,THE LIGHT AND LARK,By ways of prayer.
4742,THE LIGHT AND LARK,
4743,THE LIGHT AND LARK,The nightingale and dark
4744,THE LIGHT AND LARK,He gives us here:--

4755,I,
4756,I,With his herald torch in the van of day
4757,I,The star of the morning smiled;
4758,I,"And the streaks in the east were rosy gray,"
4759,I,"And the earth lay undefiled,"
4760,I,"When a morning-glory’s spiral bud,"
4761,I,"As pink as a shell and slim,"
4762,I,"Unbound the sark of her maidenhood,"
4763,I,And flashed on the dawning dim:
4764,I,"Royal she seemed, to the purple born,"
4765,I,And vain of her beauty and proud to scorn.
4766,I,
4767,I,
4768,II,II
4769,II,

4771,II,And her raiment fluttered wide;
4772,II,"Then smiled above at his scimitar,"
4773,II,And gazed around in pride:
4774,II,"The pomegranate near, with its crown of flame,"
4775,II,"And the gemmed geraniums nigh,"
4776,II,"All bowed their heads at her whispered name,"
4777,II,As she throned herself on high;
4778,II,"While the fuchsia, under her silvery hood,"
4779,II,Shrunk with a face like a bead of blood.
4780,II,
4781,II,
4782,III,III
4783,III,
4784,III,All knew that this child of the morning light
4785,III,Was queen of the morn and them;
4786,III,"That the morning-star, in his beams of white,"
4787,III,Was her prince in a diadem:
4788,III,’Twas he who had given those gems that flash
4789,III,And jewel the front of her smock;
4790,III,From his lordly fingers of light did dash
4791,III,Down pearls where she stooped to mock
4792,III,"A jessamine, pale, in the garden’s gloom,"
4793,III,"All wan of face, but of sweet perfume."
4794,III,
4795,III,
4796,IV,IV
4797,IV,
4798,IV,"And the morning-glory, in pride of birth,"
4799,IV,From the jessamine turned in scorn:
4800,IV,"“I marvel,” she said, “if thy mother earth"
4801,IV,Was not sick when thou wast born!
4802,IV,Thou art pale as an infant an hour dead--
4803,IV,"Wan thing, dost weary our eye!”"
4804,IV,And she weakly laughed and stiffened her head
4805,IV,And turned to her star in the sky.
4806,IV,"And the jessamine sighed, as she bent her head,"
4807,IV,"“I am sick of myself, and I would I were dead!”"
4808,IV,
4809,IV,
4810,V,V
4811,V,

4814,V,And this princess proud saw her lord of stars
4815,V,Snuffed out like a taper’s flame:
4816,V,And higher the lord of the light and hours
4817,V,"Glared up the glittering sky,"
4818,V,And the fragile queen of the morning flowers
4819,V,In his beams did wilt and die:
4820,V,"But the jessamine waxed in the sun-god’s ray,"
4821,V,And her breath and her beauty made sweet the day.

4827,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4828,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4829,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,A human skull in a churchyard lay;
4830,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"For the church was a wreck, and, toppling old,"
4831,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"On the graves of their dead, were the tombstones gray,"
4832,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And crumbling into mold.
4833,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4834,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And a hideous toad of this skull had made
4835,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"A house, a hermitage, long agone,"
4836,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Where the ivy-tod with many a braid
4837,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Half-hid his cell of bone.
4838,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4839,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And the place was dark; and my feet were drawn
4840,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,To the desolate spot where the tottering tombs
4841,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Seemed sheeted ghosts in the twilight wan
4842,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Of the yew-invested glooms.
4843,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4844,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,The night her crescent had slimly hung
4845,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"From a single star o’er the shattered wall,"
4846,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And its feeble light on the stone was flung
4847,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Where I sat to hear him call.
4848,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4849,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And I heard this heremite toad as he sate
4850,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,In the gloom of his ghastly hermitage
4851,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"To himself and the gloom all hollowly prate,"
4852,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Like a misanthropic sage:
4853,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4854,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"“Oh, beauty is well and wealth to all;"
4855,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,But wealth without beauty _makes_ fair:
4856,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And beauty with wealth brings wooers tall
4857,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,Whom she snares with her golden hair.
4858,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4859,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"“Though beauty be well and be wealth to all,"
4860,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"And wealth without beauty draw men,"
4861,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,"Beauty must come to the vaulted wall,"
4862,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,And what is wealth to her then?...
4863,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,
4864,THE TOAD IN THE SKULL,“This skeleton face was beautiful erst;

4878,THE MOONMEN,
4879,THE MOONMEN,
4880,THE MOONMEN,I stood in the forest on Huron Hill
4881,THE MOONMEN,When the night was old and the world was still.
4882,THE MOONMEN,
4883,THE MOONMEN,The Wind was a wizard who muttering strode
4884,THE MOONMEN,In a raven cloak on a haunted road.
4885,THE MOONMEN,
4886,THE MOONMEN,"The Sound of Water, a witch who crooned"
4887,THE MOONMEN,Her spells to the rocks the rain had runed.
4888,THE MOONMEN,
4889,THE MOONMEN,And the Gleam of the Dew on the fern’s green tip
4890,THE MOONMEN,Was a sylvan passing with robe a-drip.
4891,THE MOONMEN,
4892,THE MOONMEN,The Light of the Stars was a glimmering maid
4893,THE MOONMEN,"Who stole, an elfin, from glade to glade."
4894,THE MOONMEN,
4895,THE MOONMEN,"The Scent of the Woods in the delicate air,"
4896,THE MOONMEN,A wild-flower shape with chilly hair.
4897,THE MOONMEN,
4898,THE MOONMEN,"And Silence, a spirit who sat alone"
4899,THE MOONMEN,With lifted finger and eyes of stone.
4900,THE MOONMEN,
4901,THE MOONMEN,And it seemed to me these six were met
4902,THE MOONMEN,To greet a greater who came not yet.
4903,THE MOONMEN,
4904,THE MOONMEN,"And the speech they spoke, that I listened to,"
4905,THE MOONMEN,Was the archetype of the speech I knew.
4906,THE MOONMEN,
4907,THE MOONMEN,"For the Wind clasped hands with the Water’s rush,"
4908,THE MOONMEN,"And I heard them whisper, “Hush, oh, hush!”"
4909,THE MOONMEN,
4910,THE MOONMEN,The Light of the Stars and the Dew’s cool Gleam
4911,THE MOONMEN,"Touched lips and murmured, “Dream, oh, dream!”"
4912,THE MOONMEN,
4913,THE MOONMEN,The Scent of the Woods and the Silence deep
4914,THE MOONMEN,"Sighed, bosom to bosom, “Sleep, oh, sleep!”"
4915,THE MOONMEN,
4916,THE MOONMEN,"And so for a moment the six were dumb,"
4917,THE MOONMEN,"Then exulted together, “They come, they come!”"
4918,THE MOONMEN,
4919,THE MOONMEN,And I stood expectant and seemed to hear
4920,THE MOONMEN,A visible music drawing near.
4921,THE MOONMEN,
4922,THE MOONMEN,And the first who came was the Captain Moon
4923,THE MOONMEN,Bearing a shield in God’s House hewn.
4924,THE MOONMEN,
4925,THE MOONMEN,"Then an Army of Glamour, a glittering host,"
4926,THE MOONMEN,Beleaguered the night from coast to coast.
4927,THE MOONMEN,
4928,THE MOONMEN,And the world was filled with spheric fire
4929,THE MOONMEN,"From the palpitant chords of many a lyre,"
4930,THE MOONMEN,
4931,THE MOONMEN,As out of the East the Moonmen came
4932,THE MOONMEN,Smiting their harps of silver and flame.
4933,THE MOONMEN,
4934,THE MOONMEN,More beauty and grace did their forms express
4935,THE MOONMEN,Than the God of Love’s white nakedness.
4936,THE MOONMEN,
4937,THE MOONMEN,More chastity too their faces held
4938,THE MOONMEN,Than the snowy breasts of Diana swelled.
4939,THE MOONMEN,
4940,THE MOONMEN,"Translucent-limbed, I saw the beat"
4941,THE MOONMEN,In their hearts of pearl of the golden heat.
4942,THE MOONMEN,
4943,THE MOONMEN,"And the hair they tossed was a crystal light,"
4944,THE MOONMEN,And the eyes beneath it were burning white.
4945,THE MOONMEN,
4946,THE MOONMEN,"Their hands that lifted, their feet that fell,"
4947,THE MOONMEN,Made the darkness blossom to asphodel.
4948,THE MOONMEN,
4949,THE MOONMEN,"And the heavens, the hills, and the streams they trod"
4950,THE MOONMEN,Shone pale with th’ communicated God.
4951,THE MOONMEN,
4952,THE MOONMEN,"A placid frenzy, a waking trance,"
4953,THE MOONMEN,"A soft oracular radiance,"
4954,THE MOONMEN,
4955,THE MOONMEN,"Wrapped forms that moved as melodies move,"
4956,THE MOONMEN,Laurelled with Godhead and haloed with Love.
4957,THE MOONMEN,
4958,THE MOONMEN,And there in the forest on Huron Hill
4959,THE MOONMEN,The Moonmen camped when the world was still.
4960,THE MOONMEN,
4961,THE MOONMEN,*       *       *       *       *
4962,THE MOONMEN,
4963,THE MOONMEN,What wonder that they who have looked on these
4964,THE MOONMEN,Are lost to the earth’s realities!
4965,THE MOONMEN,
4966,THE MOONMEN,That they sit aside with a far-off look
4967,THE MOONMEN,Dreaming the dreams that are writ in no book!
4968,THE MOONMEN,
4969,THE MOONMEN,"That they walk alone till the day they die,"

4980,PHANTOMS,"This was her home, whose beauty now is dust,"
4981,PHANTOMS,A lonely memory for melodies
4982,PHANTOMS,"The wild birds sing, the wild birds and the bees."
4983,PHANTOMS,
4984,PHANTOMS,Here every evening is a prayer: no boast
4985,PHANTOMS,Or ruin of sunset makes the wan world wroth;
4986,PHANTOMS,"Here, through the twilight, like a pale flower’s ghost,"
4987,PHANTOMS,"A drowsy flutter, flies the tiger-moth;"
4988,PHANTOMS,And dusk spreads darkness like a dewy cloth.
4989,PHANTOMS,
4990,PHANTOMS,"In vagabond velvet, all the placid day"
4991,PHANTOMS,"A stain of crimson, lolls the butterfly;"
4992,PHANTOMS,The south-wind sows with ripple and with ray
4993,PHANTOMS,The pleasant waters; and the gentle sky
4994,PHANTOMS,Looks on the homestead like a quiet eye.
4995,PHANTOMS,
4996,PHANTOMS,"Their melancholy quaver, lone and low,"
4997,PHANTOMS,"When day is done, the gray tree-toads repeat:"

4999,PHANTOMS,"Complain to silence: and the lightnings beat,"

5001,PHANTOMS,
5002,PHANTOMS,"He comes not yet: not till the dusk is dead,"
5003,PHANTOMS,And all the western glow is far withdrawn;
5004,PHANTOMS,"Not till,--a sleepy mouth love’s kiss makes red,--"
5005,PHANTOMS,"The baby bud opes in a rosy yawn,"
5006,PHANTOMS,Breathing sweet guesses of the dreamed-of dawn.
5007,PHANTOMS,
5008,PHANTOMS,"When in the shadows, like a rain of gold,"
5009,PHANTOMS,The fireflies stream steadily; and bright
5010,PHANTOMS,"Along the moss the glow-worm, as of old,"
5011,PHANTOMS,A crawling sparkle--like a crooked light
5012,PHANTOMS,"In smoldering vellum--scrawls a square of night,--"
5013,PHANTOMS,
5014,PHANTOMS,"Then will he come, and she will lean to him,--"
5015,PHANTOMS,"She who is buried there, within that place,--"
5016,PHANTOMS,Between the starlight and his eyes; so dim
5017,PHANTOMS,"With suave control and soul-compelling grace,"

5153,IDENTITIES,I sat alone in the arrased room
5154,IDENTITIES,"Of Sin, wrapped pale in her winding shroud;"
5155,IDENTITIES,"The night was stricken with glare and gloom,"
5156,IDENTITIES,And the wailing wind was loud.
5157,IDENTITIES,
5158,IDENTITIES,I heard the gallop of one who rode
5159,IDENTITIES,Like a rushing leaf on the wind that lisps;
5160,IDENTITIES,The night with the speed of her steed was sowed
5161,IDENTITIES,With streaming will-o’-the-wisps.
5162,IDENTITIES,
5163,IDENTITIES,"And I said to myself, “’Tis a long-lost Shame,"
5164,IDENTITIES,Who rides to my house through the night and rain!
5165,IDENTITIES,She will blaze in the blackness a face of flame

5167,IDENTITIES,
5168,IDENTITIES,I thought of the blame on her lips and brow;
5169,IDENTITIES,And stared at the door she must enter in--
5170,IDENTITIES,To sear my soul with her eyes and bow
5171,IDENTITIES,My heart by the corpse of Sin.
5172,IDENTITIES,
5173,IDENTITIES,"As hushed as the mansion of death was night,"
5174,IDENTITIES,"When, dark as a sob of the storm, she came--"
5175,IDENTITIES,"But her face, like beautiful Sin’s, was white,"

5187,HALLOWE’EN,And heard her still step on the hush-haunted air.
5188,HALLOWE’EN,
5189,HALLOWE’EN,It was last Hallowe’en in the glimmer and swoon
5190,HALLOWE’EN,"Of mist and of moonlight, where once we had sinned,"

5204,HALLOWE’EN,"It was last Hallowe’en, the haunted, the dread,"

7060,I,I
7061,I,
7062,I,I heard the hylas in the bottomlands
7063,I,Piping a reed-note in the praise of Spring:
7064,I,"The South-wind brought the music on its wing,"
7065,I,As ’t were a hundred strands
7066,I,Of guttural gold smitten of elfin hands;
7067,I,"Or of sonorous silver, struck by bands,"
7068,I,"Anviled within the earth,"
7069,I,Of laboring gnomes shaping some gem of worth.
7070,I,Sounds that seemed to bid
7071,I,The wildflowers wake;
7072,I,"Unclose each dewy lid,"
7073,I,And starrily shake
7074,I,Sleep from their airy eyes
7075,I,"Beneath the loam,"
7076,I,"And, robed in dædal dyes,"
7077,I,"Frail as the fluttering foam,"
7078,I,In countless myriads rise.
7079,I,And in my city home
7080,I,"I, too, who heard"
7081,I,"Their reedy word,"
7082,I,"Awoke, and, with my soul, went forth to roam."
7083,I,
7084,I,
7085,II,II
7086,II,
7087,II,And under glimpses of the cloud-white sky
7088,II,My soul and I
7089,II,"Beheld her seated, Spring among the woods"
7090,II,"With bright attendants,"
7091,II,"Two radiant maidens,"
7092,II,"The Wind and Sun: one robed in cadence,"
7093,II,"And one in white resplendence,"
7094,II,Working wild wonders with the solitudes.
7095,II,"And thus it was,"
7096,II,"So it seemed to me,"
7097,II,Where she sat apart
7098,II,"Fondling a bee,"
7099,II,"By some strange art,"
7100,II,"As in a glass,"
7101,II,Down in her heart
7102,II,My eyes could see
7103,II,What would come to pass:--
7104,II,"How in each tree,"
7105,II,"Each blade of grass,--"
7106,II,"Dead though it seemed,--"
7107,II,Still lived and dreamed
7108,II,"Life and perfume,"
7109,II,"Color and bloom,"
7110,II,Housed from the North
7111,II,"Like golden mirth,"

7120,III,And all the woods
7121,III,"Of blossoms now, still, still their hoods"
7122,III,"And heads of blue and gold,"
7123,III,And pink and pearl lay hidden in the mould;
7124,III,"And in a day or two,"
7125,III,When Spring’s fair feet came twinkling through
7126,III,"The trees, their gold and blue,"
7127,III,"And pearl and pink in countless bands would rise,"
7128,III,Invading all these ways
7129,III,"With loveliness; and to the skies,"
7130,III,In radiant rapture raise
7131,III,The fragile sweetness of a thousand eyes.
7132,III,When every foot of soil would boast
7133,III,An ambuscade
7134,III,Of blossoms; each green rood parade
7135,III,Its flowery host;
7136,III,"And every acre of the woods,"
7137,III,"With little bird-like beaks of leaves and buds,"
7138,III,Brag of its beauty; making bankrupts of

7148,IV,Now every spine and splinter
7149,IV,"Of wood, washed clean of winter,"
7150,IV,By hill and canyon
7151,IV,"Makes of itself an intimate companion,"
7152,IV,"A confidant, who whispers me the dreams"
7153,IV,"That haunt its heart, and clothe it as with gleams."
7154,IV,And lonely now no more
7155,IV,I walk the mossy floor
7156,IV,"Of woodlands where each bourgeoning leaf is matched,"
7157,IV,Mated with music; triumphed o’er
7158,IV,Of building love and nestling song just hatched.

7170,V,"The birds are singing, singing,"
7171,V,"And all the world’s elate,"
7172,V,"As o’er the hills, as ’twere from Heaven’s gate,"
7173,V,"With garments, dewy-clinging,"
7174,V,"Comes Spring, around whose way the budded woods are ringing"
7175,V,With redbird and with bluebird and with thrush;
7176,V,"While, overhead, on happy wings is swinging"
7177,V,The swallow through the heaven’s azure hush:
7178,V,"And wren and sparrow, vireo and crow"
7179,V,"Are busy with their nests, or high or low,"
7180,V,"In every tree, it seems, and every bush."
7181,V,"The loamy odor of the turfy heat,"
7182,V,"Breathed warm from every field and wood-retreat,"
7183,V,Is as if spirits passed on flowery feet:--
7184,V,That indescribable
7185,V,"Aroma of the woods one knows so well,"
7186,V,"Reminding one of sylvan presences,"
7187,V,"Clad on with lichen and with moss,"
7188,V,That haunt and trail across
7189,V,The woods’ dim dales and dells; their airy essences
7190,V,Of racy nard and musk
7191,V,Rapping at gummy husk
7192,V,And honeyed sheath of every leaf and flower
7193,V,"That open to their knock, each at the appointed hour:--"
7194,V,"And, lo!"
7195,V,"Where’er they go,"
7196,V,Behold a miracle
7197,V,Too beautiful to tell!--
7198,V,Where late the woods were bare
7199,V,The red-bud shakes its hair
7200,V,Of flowering flame; the dogwood and the haw
7201,V,Voluble with bees dazzle with pearl the shaw;
7202,V,"And the broad maple crimsons, sunset-red,"
7203,V,Through firmaments of forest overhead:
7204,V,"And of its boughs the wild-crab makes a lair,"
7205,V,"A rosy cloud of blossoms, for the bees,"
7206,V,"Bewildered there,"
7207,V,To traffic in; lulling itself with these.
7208,V,And in the whispering woods
7209,V,The wild-flower multitudes
7210,V,"Rise, star, and bell, and bugle, all amort"
7211,V,To everything save their own loveliness
7212,V,"And the soft wind’s caress,--"
7213,V,"The wind that tip-toes through them:--liverwort,"
7214,V,"Spring-beauty, windflower and the bleeding-heart,"
7215,V,"And bloodroot, holding low"
7216,V,Its cups of stainless snow;
7217,V,"Sorrel and trillium and the twin-leaf, too,"
7218,V,"Twinkling, like stars, through dew:"
7219,V,"And patches, as it were, of saffron skies,"
7220,V,Ranunculus; and golden eyes
7221,V,"Of adder’s-tongue; and mines,"
7222,V,"It seems, of grottoed gold, the poppy-celandines;"
7223,V,"And, sapphire-spilled,"
7224,V,"Bluets and violets,"
7225,V,"Dark pansy-violets and columbines,"
7226,V,With rainy radiance filled;
7227,V,"And many more whose names my mind forgets,"
7228,V,But not my heart:
7229,V,"The Nations of the Flowers, making gay"
7230,V,"In every place and part,"
7231,V,With pomp and pageantry
7232,V,"Of absolute Beauty, all the worlds of woods,"
7233,V,"In congregated multitudes,"
7234,V,Assembled where
7235,V,"Unearthly colors all the oaks put on,"
7236,V,"Velvet and silk and vair,"
7237,V,"Vermeil and mauve and fawn,"
7238,V,Dim and auroral as the hues of dawn.

7378,V,"Huddled beneath, each like a sleep-closed eye:"
7379,V,Gold adder’s-tongue and pink
7380,V,Oxalis; snow-pale bloodroot blooms;
7381,V,"May-apple hoods, that parasol the brink,"

7482,VIII,"Around the world, like some exultant raid,"
7483,VIII,Even to the heaven’s verge.
7484,VIII,Soon shall her legions storm
7485,VIII,"Death’s ramparts, planting Life’s fair standard there,"
7486,VIII,"The banner which her beauty hath in care,"
7487,VIII,"Beauty, that shall eventuate"
7488,VIII,"With all the pomp and pageant and the state,"
7489,VIII,"That are a part of power, and that wait"
7490,VIII,"On majesty, to which it, too, is heir.”"

7494,IX,
7495,IX,Already bluish pink and green
7496,IX,The bloodroot’s buds and leaves are seen
7497,IX,Clumped in dim cirques; one from the other
7498,IX,Hardly distinguished in the shadowy smother
7499,IX,Of last year’s leaves blown brown between.
7500,IX,"And, piercing through the layers of dead leaves,"
7501,IX,The searching eye perceives
7502,IX,"The dog’s-tooth violet, pointed needle-keen,"
7503,IX,Lifting its beak of mottled green;
7504,IX,While near it heaves
7505,IX,"The May-apple its umbrous spike, a ball,--"
7506,IX,"Like to a round, green bean,"
7507,IX,"That folds its blossom,--topping its tight-closed parasol:"
7508,IX,The clustered bluebell near
7509,IX,"Hollows its azure ear,"
7510,IX,Low-leaning to the earth as if to hear
7511,IX,The sound of its own growing and perfume
7512,IX,Flowing into its bloom:
7513,IX,And softly there
7514,IX,The twin-leaf’s stems prepare
7515,IX,"Pale tapers of transparent white,"
7516,IX,As if to light
7517,IX,The Spirit of Beauty through the wood’s green night.

7522,X,Why does Nature love the number five?
7523,X,Five-whorled leaves and five-tipped flowers?--
7524,X,"Haply the bee i’ the voluble rose,"
7525,X,"Laboring aye to store its hive,"
7526,X,"And humming away the long noon hours,"
7527,X,Haply it knows as it comes and goes:
7528,X,"Or haply the butterfly,"
7529,X,"Or moth of pansy-dye,"
7530,X,Flitting from bloom to bloom
7531,X,"In the forest’s violet gloom,"
7532,X,It knows why:
7533,X,"Or the irised fly, to whom"
7534,X,"Each bud, as it glitters near,"
7535,X,Lends eager and ardent ear.--
7536,X,"And, also, tell"
7537,X,Why Nature loves so well
7538,X,To prank her flowers in gold and blue.
7539,X,"Haply the dew,"
7540,X,"That lies so close to them the whole night through,"
7541,X,"Hugged to each honeyed heart,"
7542,X,Perhaps the dew the secret could impart:
7543,X,"Or haply now the bluebird there that bears,"
7544,X,"Glad, unawares,"
7545,X,"God’s sapphire on its wings,"
7546,X,The lapis-lazuli
7547,X,"O’ the clean, clear sky,"
7548,X,"The heav’n of which he sings,"
7549,X,"Haply he, too, could tell me why:"
7550,X,"Or the maple there that swings,"
7551,X,"To the wind’s soft sigh,"
7552,X,"Its winglets, crystal red,"
7553,X,A rainy ruby twinkling overhead:
7554,X,"Or haply now the wind, that breathes of rain"
7555,X,"Amid the rosy boughs, it could explain:"
7556,X,"And even now, in words of mystery,--"
7557,X,"That haunt the heart of me,--"
7558,X,"Low-whispered, dim and bland,"
7559,X,"Tells me, but tells in vain,"
7560,X,"And strives to make me see and understand,"
7561,X,Delaying where
7562,X,"The feldspar fire of the violet breaks,"
7563,X,And the starred myrtle aches
7564,X,With heavenly blue; and the frail windflower shakes
7565,X,Its trembling tresses in the opal air.

7574,I,
7575,I,"The hurl and hurry of the winds of March,"
7576,I,"That tore the ash and bowed the pine and larch,"
7577,I,"And filled the night with rushings,--like the crew"
7578,I,"Of the Wild Huntsman,--and the days with hue"
7579,I,"And cry of storm, soft in the heaven’s porch"
7580,I,"Have laid them down:--loud winds, that trampled through"
7581,I,"The forests with enormous, scythe-like sweep,"
7582,I,"And from the darkened deep,"
7583,I,"The battlemented heavens, thunder-blue,"
7584,I,"Rumbled the arch,"
7585,I,"The rocking arch of all the booming oaks,"
7586,I,With stormy chariot-spokes:
7587,I,"Chariots, from which wild bugle-blasts they blew"
7588,I,In warlike challenge.... Now the windflower sweet
7589,I,"Misses the fury of their ruining feet,"
7590,I,"The trumpet-thunder of resistless flight,"
7591,I,"Crashing and vast, obliterating light;"
7592,I,Sweeping the skeleton madness down
7593,I,"Of last-year’s leaves; and, overhead,"
7594,I,"Hurrying the giant foliage of night,"
7595,I,Gaunt clouds that streamed with tempest.
7596,I,... Now each crown
7597,I,"Of ancient woods, that clamored with their tread,"
7598,I,"The frenzy of their passage, stoops no more,"
7599,I,"Hearing no more their clarion-command,"
7600,I,Their chariot-hurl and the wild whip in hand.
7601,I,"No more, no more,"
7602,I,The forests rock and roar
7603,I,And tumult with their shoutings.
7604,I,Hushed and still
7605,I,"Is the green-gleaming and the sunlit hill,"
7606,I,"Along whose sides,"
7607,I,Flushing the dewy moss and rainy grass--
7608,I,"Beneath the topaz-tinted sassafras,"
7609,I,"Pale, aromatic as some orient wine--"
7610,I,"The violet fire of the bluet glides,"
7611,I,The amaranthine flame
7612,I,Of sorrel and of bluebell runs;
7613,I,And through the drabs and duns
7614,I,"Of rotting leaves, the moonéd celandine,"
7615,I,"Line upon lovely line,"
7616,I,"Deliberate, goldens into birth:"
7617,I,"And, ruby and rose, the moccasin-flower hides:"
7618,I,"Innumerable flowers, with which she writes her name,"
7619,I,"April, upon the page,"
7620,I,The winter-withered parchment of old earth;
7621,I,"Her fragrant autograph, that gives it worth"

7627,II,"Here where the woods are wet,"
7628,II,The blossoms of the dog’s-tooth violet
7629,II,Seem meteors in a miniature firmament
7630,II,"Of wild-flowers, where, with rainy sound and scent"
7631,II,"Of breeze and blossom, dim the April went:"
7632,II,"Their tongue-like leaves of umber-mottled green,"
7633,II,"So thickly seen,"
7634,II,"Seem dropping words of gold,"
7635,II,Inaudible syllables of a magic old.
7636,II,"Beside them, near the wahoo-bush and haw,"
7637,II,Blooms the hepatica;
7638,II,Its slender flowers upon swaying stems
7639,II,"Lifting chaste, solitary blooms,"
7640,II,"Astral, and twilight-colored,--frail as gems"
7641,II,That star the diadems
7642,II,"Of elves and sylvans, piercing pale the glooms;--"
7643,II,"Or like the wands, the torches of the fays,"
7644,II,"That link lone, leafy ways"
7645,II,"With slim, uncertain rays:--"
7646,II,"(The faëry people, whom no eye may see,"

7652,II,"And haunt the banks of greenwood streams,"
7653,II,"Showing in every line and curve,"
7654,II,"Commensurate with our love, an intimacy,"
7655,II,A smiling confidence or sweet reserve.)
7656,II,
7657,II,"There, at that leafy turn,"
7658,II,"Of trailered rocks, rise fronds of hart’s-tongue fern:"
7659,II,Fronds that my fancy names
7660,II,"Uncurling gleeds of emerald and gold,"
7661,II,Whose feathering flames
7662,II,"Were kindled in the musky mould,"
7663,II,"And now, as stealthy as the graying morn,"
7664,II,"Thorn upon woolly thorn,"
7665,II,"Build up, and silently unfold"
7666,II,"Faint, cool, green fires, that burn"
7667,II,"Uneagerly, and spread around"
7668,II,"An elfin light above the ground,"
7669,II,"Like that green, rayless glow"
7670,II,"A spirit, lamped with crystal, makes below"
7671,II,"In dripping caves of labyrinthine moss,"
7672,II,Or grottoes of the weedy undertow.--
7673,II,"And in the underwoods, around them, toss"
7674,II,"The white-hearts with their penciled leaves,"
7675,II,"That, ’mid the shifting gleams and glooms,"
7676,II,"The interchanging shine and shade,"
7677,II,Seem some soft garment made
7678,II,"By visionary hands, that none perceives;"
7679,II,Hands busy with invisible looms
7680,II,"Of woodland shine and shade; a shadowy light,"
7681,II,"Whose figments interbraid,"
7682,II,Carpeting the woods with colors and perfumes.--
7683,II,"Or, are they fragments left in flight,"
7684,II,These flow’rs that scatter every glade
7685,II,"With windy, rippling white,"
7686,II,"And breezy, fluttering blue,"
7687,II,"Of her wild gown that shone upon my sight,"
7688,II,"A moment, in the woods I wandered through?"
7689,II,"April’s, who fled this way?"
7690,II,"April, whom still I follow,"
7691,II,Whom still my dreams pursue;
7692,II,Who leads me on by many a tangled clue
7693,II,"Of loveliness, until in some green hollow,"
7694,II,"Born of her fragrance and her melody,"
7695,II,"But lovelier than herself and happier, too,"
7696,II,"Cradled in blossoms of the dogwood-tree,"
7697,II,"My soul shall see,"
7698,II,"White as a sunbeam in the heart of day,"
7699,II,"The infant, May."
7700,II,
7701,II,
7702,III,III
7703,III,
7704,III,"Up, up, my heart! and forth where none perceives!"
7705,III,’Twas this which that sweet lay meant
7706,III,"You heard in dreams. Come, let us take rich payment,"
7707,III,"For every care that grieves,"
7708,III,From Nature’s prodigal purse. ’Twas this that May meant
7709,III,By sending forth the wind which round our eaves
7710,III,"Whispered all night;--or was’t the spirit who weaves,"
7711,III,"From gold and glaucous green of early leaves,"
7712,III,Spring’s regal raiment?--
7713,III,"Up, up, my heart, and forth where none perceives!"
7714,III,
7715,III,"Come, let us forth, my heart, where none divines!"
7716,III,"Into far woodland places,"
7717,III,"Where we may meet the fair assembled races,"
7718,III,"Beneath the guardian pines,"
7719,III,"Of May’s first flowers.... Poppy-celandines,"
7720,III,"And starry trilliums, bugled columbines,"
7721,III,"With which her hair, her radiant hair she twines,"
7722,III,And loops and laces.--
7723,III,"Come, let us forth, my heart, where none divines!"
7724,III,
7725,III,"Forth, forth, my heart, and let us find our dreams,"
7726,III,"There, where they haunt each hollow!"
7727,III,"Dreams luring us with oread feet to follow,"
7728,III,"With flying feet of beams,"
7729,III,Fleeter and lighter than the fleetest swallow:
7730,III,"Dreams, holding us with dryad glooms and gleams,"
7731,III,"With Naiad eyes, far stiller than still streams,"
7732,III,"That have beheld and still reflect, it seems,"
7733,III,The god Apollo.--
7734,III,"Forth, forth, my heart, and let us find our dreams!"
7735,III,
7736,III,"Out, out, my heart, the world is white with spring."
7737,III,Long have our dreams been pleaders:
7738,III,Now let them be our firm but gentle leaders.
7739,III,"Come, let us forth and sing"
7740,III,"Among the amber-emerald-tufted cedars,"
7741,III,"And balm-o’-Gileads, cotton-woods, a-swing"
7742,III,"Like giant censers, that, from leaf-cusps fling"
7743,III,"Balsams of gummy gold, bewildering"
7744,III,The winds their feeders.
7745,III,"Out, out, my heart, the world is white with spring."
7746,III,
7747,III,"Up, up, my heart, and all thy hope put on."
7748,III,Array thyself in splendor.
7749,III,"Like some bright dragon-fly, some May-fly slender,"
7750,III,The irised lamels don
7751,III,"Of thy new armor; and, where burns the centre,"
7752,III,"Refulgent, of the opening rose of dawn,"
7753,III,"Spread thy wild wings, and, ere the hour be gone,"
7754,III,"Bright as a blast from some bold clarion,"
7755,III,Thy Dream-world enter.--
7756,III,"Up, up, my heart, and all thy hope put on."
7757,III,
7758,III,
7759,IV,IV
7760,IV,
7761,IV,"And then I heard it singing,"
7762,IV,"The wind that touched my hair,"
7763,IV,"A song of wild expression,"
7764,IV,A song that called in session
7765,IV,"The wild-flowers sweetly swinging,"
7766,IV,The wild-flowers lightly flinging
7767,IV,Their tresses to the air.
7768,IV,"And first, beneath a bramble arch,"
7769,IV,The bloodroot rose; each bloom a torch
7770,IV,"Of hollow snow, within which, bright,"
7771,IV,The calyx grottoed golden light.
7772,IV,
7773,IV,"Hepatica and bluet,"
7774,IV,"And gold corydalis,"
7775,IV,Arose as to an aria;
7776,IV,"Then wild-phlox and dentaria,"
7777,IV,"In rapture, ere they knew it,"
7778,IV,"Trooped forward, nodding to it,"
7779,IV,Faint as a first star is.
7780,IV,
7781,IV,"And then a music,--to the ear"
7782,IV,"Inaudible,--I seemed to hear;"
7783,IV,A symphony that seemed to rise
7784,IV,And speak in colors to the eyes.
7785,IV,
7786,IV,I saw the Jacob’s-ladder
7787,IV,Ring violet peal on peal
7788,IV,"Of perfume, azure-swinging;"
7789,IV,The bluebell slimly ringing
7790,IV,"Its purple chimes; and, gladder,"
7791,IV,"Green note on note, the madder"
7792,IV,Bells of the Solomon’s-seal.
7793,IV,
7794,IV,"Now very near, now faintly lost,"
7795,IV,I saw their fragrant music tossed;
7796,IV,Mixed dimly with white interludes
7797,IV,Of trilliums starring cool the woods.
7798,IV,"Then choral, solitary,"
7799,IV,I saw the celandine
7800,IV,"Smite bright its golden cymbals,"
7801,IV,"The starwort shake its timbrels,"
7802,IV,"The whiteheart’s horns of Fairy,"
7803,IV,"With many a flourish airy,"
7804,IV,Strike silvery into line.
7805,IV,
7806,IV,"And, lo, my soul they seemed to draw,"
7807,IV,By chords of loveliness and awe
7808,IV,Into a Fairy world afar
7809,IV,Where all man’s dreams and longings are.
7810,IV,
7811,IV,
7812,V,V
7813,V,
7814,V,And then a spirit looked down at me
7815,V,Out of the deeps of the opal morn:
7816,V,"Its eyes were blue as a sunlit sea,"
7817,V,And young with the joy of a star that has just been born:
7818,V,"And I seemed to hear, with my soul, the rose of its cool mouth say:--"
7819,V,
7820,V,"“Long I lay, long I lay,"
7821,V,"High on the Hills of the Break-of-Day,"
7822,V,"Where ever the light is green and gray,"
7823,V,"And the gleam of the moon is a silvery spray,"
7824,V,And the stars are glimmering bubbles.
7825,V,Now from the Hills of the Break-of-Day
7826,V,"I come, I come, on a rainbow ray,"
7827,V,"To laugh and sparkle, to leap and play,"
7828,V,"And blow from the face of the world away,"
7829,V,"Like mists, its griefs and troubles.”"
7830,V,
7831,V,
7832,VI,VI
7833,VI,
7834,VI,"And now that the dawn is everywhere,"
7835,VI,"Let us take this path through this wild, green place,"
7836,VI,"Where the rattlesnake-weed shows its yellow face,"
7837,VI,And the lichens cover the rocks with lace:
7838,VI,"Where tannin-tinct is the woodland air,"
7839,VI,"Let us take this path through the oaks where, thin,"
7840,VI,"The low leaves whisper, “The day is fair”;"
7841,VI,"And waters murmur, “Come in, come in,"
7842,VI,"Where you can hark to our waterfalls,"
7843,VI,"And the wind of their foam can play with your hair,"
7844,VI,And soothe away care.--
7845,VI,"Come here, come here, where our water calls.”"
7846,VI,
7847,VI,"Berry blossoms, that seem to flow"
7848,VI,"As the winds blow,"
7849,VI,Blackberry blossoms swing and sway
7850,VI,To and fro
7851,VI,"Along the way,"
7852,VI,"Like ocean spray on a breezy day,"
7853,VI,"Over the green of the grass as foam on the green of a bay,"
7854,VI,When the world is white and green with the white and the green of May.
7855,VI,
7856,VI,
7857,VII,VII
7858,VII,
7859,VII,The dewberries are blooming now;
7860,VII,"The days are long, the nights are short;"
7861,VII,Each haw-tree and each dogwood bough
7862,VII,"Is bleached with bloom, and seems a part,--"
7863,VII,"Reflected palely on her brow,--"
7864,VII,Of dreams that haunt the Year’s young heart.
7865,VII,
7866,VII,But this will pass; and presently
7867,VII,The world forget the spring that was;
7868,VII,"And underneath the wild-plum tree,"
7869,VII,"’Mid hornet hum and wild-bee’s buzz,"
7870,VII,"Summer, in dreamy reverie,"
7871,VII,Will sit all warm and amorous.
7872,VII,
7873,VII,"Summer, with drowsy eyes and hair,"
7874,VII,Who walks the orchard aisles between;
7875,VII,"Whose hot touch tans the freckled pear,"
7876,VII,And crimsons peach and nectarine;
7877,VII,"And, in the vineyard everywhere,"
7878,VII,Bubbles with blue the grape’s ripe green.
7879,VII,
7880,VII,"Where now the briers blossoming are,"
7881,VII,Soon will the berries darkly glow;
7882,VII,"Then Summer pass: and star on star,"
7883,VII,Where now the grass is strewn below
7884,VII,"With petals, soon, both near and far,"
7885,VII,Will lie the obliterating snow.
7886,VII,
7887,VII,
7888,VIII,VIII
7889,VIII,
7890,VIII,"But now the bluets blooming,"
7891,VIII,"The bluets brightly blue,"
7892,VIII,"O’er which the bees go booming,"
7893,VIII,"Drunk with the honey-dew,"
7894,VIII,"From wood-ways which they strew,"
7895,VIII,Make eyes of love at you....
7896,VIII,"O slender Quaker-ladies,"
7897,VIII,"With eyes of heavenly hue,"
7898,VIII,"Who, where the mossy shade is,"
7899,VIII,"Hold quiet Quaker-meeting,"
7900,VIII,"Now tell me, is it true"
7901,VIII,That these wild-bees are raiders?
7902,VIII,Bold gold-galloonéd raiders?
7903,VIII,Gold-belted ambuscaders?--
7904,VIII,"Or are they serenaders,"
7905,VIII,"Your gold-hipped serenaders,"
7906,VIII,"That, to your ears repeating"
7907,VIII,"Old ballads, come to woo,"
7908,VIII,"And win the hearts of you,"
7909,VIII,The golden hearts of you?
7910,VIII,
7911,VIII,"And here the bells of th’ huckleberries toss, so it seems, in time,"
7912,VIII,"Delicate, tenderly white, thick by the wildwood way;"
7913,VIII,"Clusters swinging, it seems, inaudible peals of rhyme,"
7914,VIII,"Music visibly dropped from the virginal lips of the May,"
7915,VIII,"Crystally dropped, so it seems, bar upon blossoming bar,"
7916,VIII,"Pendent, pensively pale, star upon hollowed star."
7917,VIII,
7918,VIII,
7919,IX,IX
7920,IX,
7921,IX,"The star-flower now, that disks with gold"
7922,IX,"The woodland moss, the forest grass,"
7923,IX,"Already in a day is old,"
7924,IX,Already doth its beauty pass;
7925,IX,"Soon, undistinguished, with the mould"
7926,IX,"’Twill mingle and ’twill mix, alas."
7927,IX,"The bluet, too, that spreads its skies,"
7928,IX,"Its little heavens, at our feet;"
7929,IX,"And crowfoot-bloom, that, with soft eyes"
7930,IX,"Of amber, now our eyes doth greet,"
7931,IX,"Shall fade and pass, and none surmise"
7932,IX,How once they made the Maytime sweet.
7933,IX,
7934,IX,
7935,X,X
7936,X,
7937,X,But the crowfoot-bloom still trails its gold
7938,X,Along the edges of the oak-wood old;
7939,X,"And there, where spreads the pond, still white are seen"
7940,X,The lilies islanded between
7941,X,The pads’ round archipelagoes of green;
7942,X,The jade-dark pads that pave

7944,X,In which the vireo and the sparrow lave
7945,X,"Their fluttered breasts and wings,"

7947,X,With necks the moisture streaks;
7948,X,"Then dipping deep their beaks,"
7949,X,"To which the beaded coolness clings,"
7950,X,They bend their mellow throats
7951,X,And let the freshness trickle into notes.
7952,X,
7953,X,And now you hear
7954,X,The red-capped woodpecker rap near;
7955,X,"And now that acrobat,"
7956,X,"The yellow-breasted chat,"
7957,X,"Calls high and clear,"
7958,X,Chuckling his grotesque music from
7959,X,Some bough that he hath clomb.
7960,X,"And now, and now,"
7961,X,"Upon another bough,"
7962,X,Hark how the honey-throated thrush
7963,X,Scatters the forest’s listening hush
7964,X,"With notes of limpid harmony,"
7965,X,Taking the woods with witchery--
7966,X,"Or is ’t a spirit, none can see."
7967,X,"Hid in the top of some old tree,"
7968,X,"Who, in his house of leaves, of haunted green,"
7969,X,"Keeps trying, silver-sweet, his sunbeam flute serene?"

7973,XI,
7974,XI,"And then as I listened I seemed to see,"
7975,XI,"Out of the sunset’s ruin of gold,"
7976,XI,"A presence, a spirit, look down at me,"
7977,XI,With eyes that were grave with the grief of a world grown old;
7978,XI,"And I seemed to hear, with my soul, the flame of its sad mouth sigh:"
7979,XI,
7980,XI,"“Now good-by, now good-by."
7981,XI,Down to the Caves of the Night go I;
7982,XI,"Where a shadowy couch of the purple sky,"
7983,XI,"That the moon and the starlight curtain high,"
7984,XI,Is spread for my joy and sorrow:
7985,XI,"Down to the Caves of the Night go I,"
7986,XI,Where side by side with mystery
7987,XI,And all the Yesterdays I’ll lie;
7988,XI,"And where from my body, before I die,"
7989,XI,Will be born the young To-morrow.”
7990,XI,
7991,XI,
7992,XII,XII
7993,XII,
7994,XII,"And here where the dusk steals on, you see,"
7995,XII,"Violet-mantled, from tree to tree,"
7996,XII,"The milkwort’s spike of lavender hue,--"
7997,XII,"Of rosy blue,--"
7998,XII,"Tipped by the weight of a passing bee,--"
7999,XII,"Nods like a goblin night-cap, slim, sedate,"
8000,XII,"That night shall tassel with the dew,"
8001,XII,Beneath a canopy of rose and rue.
8002,XII,And as the purple state
8003,XII,"Of twilight crowds the sunset’s crimson gate,"
8004,XII,"Now one, now two,"
8005,XII,"Drifting the oaks’ dark vistas through,"
8006,XII,"The screech-owl’s cry of “Who, oh, who,"
8007,XII,Who stays so late?”
8008,XII,Drops like a challenge down to you.
8009,XII,"The silence deepens; it seems so still,"
8010,XII,"That, if you laid to the tree your ear,"
8011,XII,You too might hear
8012,XII,Its great roots growing into the hill;
8013,XII,"Or there on the twig of the oak-tree tall,"
8014,XII,The gray-green egg in the gray-green gall
8015,XII,"Split, and the little round worm and white,"
8016,XII,"That grows to a gnat in a summer night,"
8017,XII,Uncurl in its nest as it dreams of flight.
8018,XII,"In the heart of the weed that grows near by,--"
8019,XII,If you laid your ear
8020,XII,"To a leaflet near,--"
8021,XII,"You too might hear, if you, too, would try,"
8022,XII,"The little gray worm, that becomes a fly"
8023,XII,"A gray wood-fly, a rainbowed fly,"
8024,XII,"As it feels a yearning for wings within,"
8025,XII,"Minute of movement, steadily,--"
8026,XII,"As a leaf-bud pushes from forth a tree,--"
8027,XII,"Under the milk of its larval skin,"
8028,XII,The outward pressure of wings begin.
8029,XII,
8030,XII,"Far off a vesper-sparrow lifts its song,"
8031,XII,Lost in the woods that now are beryl-wan;
8032,XII,"The path is drowned in dusk, is almost gone,"
8033,XII,Where now a fox or rabbit steals along:
8034,XII,"Dark is each vine-roofed hollow where, withdrawn,"
8035,XII,"The creek-frog sounds his guttural gong,"
8036,XII,"Like some squat dwarf or gnome,"
8037,XII,"Seated upon his temple’s oozy dome,"
8038,XII,"Summoning the faithful unto prayer,"
8039,XII,"Muezzin-like, the worshipers of the moon,"
8040,XII,"The insect people of the earth and air,"
8041,XII,Who join him in his twilight tune.
8042,XII,
8043,XII,"Along the path, where the lizard hides,"
8044,XII,"An instant shadow, the spider glides;"
8045,XII,"The hairy spider, that haunts the way,"
8046,XII,"Crouching black by its earth-bored hole,"
8047,XII,"An insect ogre, that lairs with the mole,"
8048,XII,"Hungry, seeking its insect prey,"
8049,XII,Fast to follow and swift to slay.--
8050,XII,And over your hands and over your face
8051,XII,The cobweb brushes its phantom lace:
8052,XII,"And now, from many a stealthy place,"
8053,XII,"Woolly-winged and gossamer-gray,"
8054,XII,"The forest moths come fluttering,"
8055,XII,"Marked and mottled with lichen hues,"
8056,XII,"Seal-soft umbers and downy blues,"
8057,XII,Dark as the bark to which they cling.

8062,XIII,"Now in the hollow of a hill,--"
8063,XIII,"Like a glow-worm held in a giant hand,--"
8064,XIII,"Under the sunset’s last red band,"
8065,XIII,"And one star hued like a daffodil,"
8066,XIII,The windowed lamp of a cabin glows;
8067,XIII,"The charcoal-burner’s, whose hut is poor"
8068,XIII,But always open; beside whose door
8069,XIII,An oak grows gnarled and a pine stands slim.
8070,XIII,"Clean of soul, though of feature grim,"
8071,XIII,"Here he houses where no one knows,"
8072,XIII,"His only neighbors the cawing crows,"
8073,XIII,That make a roost of the pine’s top limb:
8074,XIII,His only friend the fiddle he bows
8075,XIII,As he sits at his door in the eve’s repose
8076,XIII,"Making it chuckle and sing and speak,"
8077,XIII,Lovingly pressed to his swarthy cheek.
8078,XIII,
8079,XIII,"And over many a root, through flowers and weeds,"
8080,XIII,"Past lonely places where the raccoon breeds,"
8081,XIII,"By many a rock and water lying dim,"
8082,XIII,"Roofed with the brier and the bramble-rose,"
8083,XIII,"Under a star and the new-moon’s rim,"
8084,XIII,"Downward the wood-way leads to him,"
8085,XIII,"Down where his lone lamp gleams and glows,"
8086,XIII,A pencil slim
8087,XIII,Of marigold light under leaf and limb.

8149,XIV,
8150,XIV,"The soul, that oft hath heard the trees’ huge roots"

8152,XIV,The bird-like beaks of the imprisoned shoots
8153,XIV,Peck through the bark and into leaves uncoil;

8155,XIV,Groping its blind way up to light and God;
8156,XIV,"The fungus, laboring with gnome-like toil,"
8157,XIV,Heave slow its white orb through the encircling sod.
8158,XIV,
8159,XIV,"The winds and waters, stars and streams and flowers,"
8160,XIV,The very stones have tongues: and moss and fern
8161,XIV,And even lichens speak. This world of ours

8198,THE MAN HUNT,And the brush is wild where a man may hide.
8199,THE MAN HUNT,
8200,THE MAN HUNT,They have brought the bloodhounds up again
8201,THE MAN HUNT,To the roadside rock where they found the slain.
8202,THE MAN HUNT,
8203,THE MAN HUNT,"They have brought the bloodhounds up, and they"

8205,THE MAN HUNT,
8206,THE MAN HUNT,"Three times they circled the trail and crossed,"
8207,THE MAN HUNT,And thrice they found it and thrice they lost.
8208,THE MAN HUNT,
8209,THE MAN HUNT,Now straight through the trees and the underbrush
8210,THE MAN HUNT,They follow the scent through the forest’s hush.
8211,THE MAN HUNT,
8212,THE MAN HUNT,And their deep-mouthed bay is a pulse of fear
8213,THE MAN HUNT,In the heart of the wood that the man must hear.
8214,THE MAN HUNT,
8215,THE MAN HUNT,The man who crouches among the trees
8216,THE MAN HUNT,From the stern-faced men who follow these.
8217,THE MAN HUNT,
8218,THE MAN HUNT,A huddle of rocks that the ooze has mossed
8219,THE MAN HUNT,And the trail of the hunted again is lost.
8220,THE MAN HUNT,
8221,THE MAN HUNT,"An upturned pebble, a bit of ground"
8222,THE MAN HUNT,A heel has trampled--the trail is found.
8223,THE MAN HUNT,
8224,THE MAN HUNT,And the woods reëcho the bloodhounds’ bay
8225,THE MAN HUNT,As again they take to the mountain way.
8226,THE MAN HUNT,
8227,THE MAN HUNT,"A rock, a ribbon of road, a ledge,"

8230,THE MAN HUNT,"A pine, that the lightning long since clave,"
8231,THE MAN HUNT,Whose huge roots hollow a ragged cave.
8232,THE MAN HUNT,
8233,THE MAN HUNT,"A shout, a curse, and a face aghast,"
8234,THE MAN HUNT,And the human quarry is laired at last.
8235,THE MAN HUNT,
8236,THE MAN HUNT,The human quarry with clay-clogged hair
8237,THE MAN HUNT,And eyes of terror who waits them there.

8240,THE MAN HUNT,Hurls clods and curses at dogs and men.

8259,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And forms of shadows, whose shapes elude"
8260,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"The searching swords of the sun’s dim gleam,"
8261,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Builders of silence and solitude.
8262,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And there, where a glimmering water crept"
8263,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"From rock to rock with a slumberous sound,"
8264,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Tired to tears, on the mossy ground,"
8265,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Under a tree I lay and slept.
8266,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,
8267,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Was it the heart of an olden oak?
8268,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Was it the soul of a flower that died?
8269,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Or was it the wild-rose there that spoke,"
8270,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,The wilding lily that palely sighed?--
8271,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,For all on a sudden it seemed I awoke:
8272,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,And the leaves and the flowers were all intent
8273,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,On a visible something of light and bloom--
8274,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"A presence, felt as a wild perfume,"
8275,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Or beautiful music, that came and went."
8276,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,
8277,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And all the grief I had known was gone,"
8278,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,And all the anguish of heart and soul;

8282,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And lo! it was night. And the oval moon,"
8283,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"A silvery spectre, paced the wood:"
8284,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And there in its light, like snow, she stood,"
8285,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,As starry still as a star a-swoon.
8286,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,
8287,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,At first I thought that I looked into
8288,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"A shadowy water of violet,"
8289,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Where the faint reflection of one I knew,"
8290,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Long dead, gazed up from its mirror wet,"
8291,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Till she smiled in my face as the living do:
8292,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Till I felt her touch, and heard her say,"
8293,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"In a voice as still as a rose unfolds,--"
8294,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,“You have come at last: now nothing holds:
8295,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Give me your hand: let us wander away.

8297,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"“Let us wander away through the Shadow Wood,"
8298,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Through the Shadow Wood to the Shadow Land,"
8299,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Where the trees have speech and the blossoms brood,"
8300,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Like visible music; and, hand in hand,"
8301,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"The winds and the waves go, rainbow-hued:"
8302,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Where ever the voice of beauty sighs,"
8303,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,And ever the dance of dreams goes on;
8304,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Where nothing grows old: and the dead and gone,"
8305,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And the loved and the lost, smile into your eyes."
8306,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,
8307,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,“Let us wander away! let us wander away!--
8308,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Do you hear them calling, ‘Come here and live’?"
8309,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Do you hear what the trees and the flowers say,"
8310,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Wonderful, wild, and imperative,"
8311,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Hushed as the hues of the dawn of day?--
8312,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"They say, ‘Your life, that was rose and rue,"
8313,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"In a world of shadows where all things die,"
8314,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Where beauty is dust, and love, a lie,"
8315,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Is ended. Come! we are waiting for you.’”
8316,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,
8317,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,And she took my hand: and the trees around
8318,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Seemed whispering something I dared not hear;
8319,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And the taciturn flowers, that strewed the ground,"
8320,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Seemed thinking something I felt with fear--
8321,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,A beautiful something that made no sound.--
8322,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And she led me on through the forest old,"
8323,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Where the moon and the midnight stood on guard,--"
8324,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Sentinel spirits that shimmered the sward,"
8325,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Silver and sable and glimmering gold.
8326,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,
8327,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,And then in a moment I knew.... I knew
8328,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"What the trees had whispered, the winds had said;"
8329,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"What the flowers had thought in their hearts of dew,"
8330,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,And the stars had syllabled overhead--
8331,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"And she bent above me and smiled, “’Tis true!"
8332,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,"Heart of my heart, you have heard aright.--"
8333,THE FOREST OF SHADOWS,Look in my eyes and draw me near!

8432,MUSIC AND MOONLIGHT,"And as the full moon flows,"

8497,THE AWAKENING,"And she, who lay where, through the casement falling,"
8498,THE AWAKENING,The moonlight clasped with arms of vapory gold
8499,THE AWAKENING,"Her Danaë beauty, seemed to hear a calling"
8500,THE AWAKENING,Deep in the garden old.
8501,THE AWAKENING,
8502,THE AWAKENING,"And then it seemed, through some strange sense, she heard"
8503,THE AWAKENING,"The roses softly speaking in the night,--"
8504,THE AWAKENING,Or was it but the nocturne of a bird
8505,THE AWAKENING,Haunting the white moonlight?
8506,THE AWAKENING,It seemed a fragrant whisper vaguely roaming
8507,THE AWAKENING,"From rose to rose, a language sweet that blushed,"
8508,THE AWAKENING,"Saying, “Who comes? Who is this swiftly coming,"
8509,THE AWAKENING,With face so dim and hushed?
8510,THE AWAKENING,
8511,THE AWAKENING,"“And now, and now we hear a wild heart beating--"
8512,THE AWAKENING,Whose heart is this that beats among our blooms?
8513,THE AWAKENING,Whose every pulse in rapture keeps repeating
8514,THE AWAKENING,Wild words like wild perfumes?” ...
8515,THE AWAKENING,"And then it ceased: and then she heard a sigh,"
8516,THE AWAKENING,"As if a lily syllabled sweet scent,--"
8517,THE AWAKENING,Or was it but the wind that silverly
8518,THE AWAKENING,Touched some stringed instrument?
8519,THE AWAKENING,
8520,THE AWAKENING,And then again a rumor she detected
8521,THE AWAKENING,"Among the roses, words of musk and myrrh,"
8522,THE AWAKENING,"Saying, “He comes! the one she hath expected,"
8523,THE AWAKENING,Who long hath sought for her.
8524,THE AWAKENING,"The one whose coming made her soul awaken,"
8525,THE AWAKENING,Whose face is fragrance and whose feet are fire:
8526,THE AWAKENING,The one by whom her being shall be shaken
8527,THE AWAKENING,With dreams and deep desire.”
8528,THE AWAKENING,
8529,THE AWAKENING,"And then she rose, and to the casement hastened,"
8530,THE AWAKENING,"And flung it wide and, leaning outward, gazed:"
8531,THE AWAKENING,"Above, the night hung, moon and starlight chastened;"
8532,THE AWAKENING,"Below, with shadows mazed,"
8533,THE AWAKENING,The garden bloomed. Around her and o’erhead
8534,THE AWAKENING,"All seemed at pause--save one wild star that streamed,"
8535,THE AWAKENING,"One rose that fell.--And then she sighed and said,"
8536,THE AWAKENING,"“I must have dreamed, have dreamed.”"
8537,THE AWAKENING,
8538,THE AWAKENING,"And then again she seemed to hear it speak,"
8539,THE AWAKENING,"A moth that murmured of a star attained,--"
8540,THE AWAKENING,"Or was it but the fountain whispering weak,"
8541,THE AWAKENING,White where the moonbeams rained?
8542,THE AWAKENING,"And still it grew; and still the sound insisted,"
8543,THE AWAKENING,"Louder and sweeter, burning into form,"
8544,THE AWAKENING,"Until at last a presence, starlight-misted,"
8545,THE AWAKENING,It shone there rosy warm:
8546,THE AWAKENING,
8547,THE AWAKENING,"Crying, “Come down! long have I watched and waited!"
8548,THE AWAKENING,"Come down! draw near! or, like some splendid flower,"
8549,THE AWAKENING,Let down thy hair! so I may climb as fated
8550,THE AWAKENING,Into thy heart’s high tower.
8551,THE AWAKENING,"Lower! bend lower, so thy heart may hear me!"
8552,THE AWAKENING,Thy soul may clasp me!... Beautiful above

9185,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Like some gaunt ghost the tempest wails
9186,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Outside my door; its icy nails
9187,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Beat on my pane. And night and storm
9188,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Around the house, with furious flails"
9189,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Of wind, from which the slant sleet hails,"
9190,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Stalk up and down; or, arm in arm,"
9191,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Stand giant guard; the wild-beast lair
9192,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Of their fierce bosoms black and bare....
9193,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,My lamp is lit. I have no fear.
9194,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Through night and storm my love draws near.
9195,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,
9196,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Now through the forest how they go,"
9197,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"With whirlwind hoofs, and maned with snow,"
9198,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"The beasts of tempest! winter herds,"
9199,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,That lift huge heads of mist and low
9200,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Like oxen; beasts of air, that blow"
9201,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Ice from their nostrils; winged like birds,"
9202,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"And bullock-breasted, onward hurled,"
9203,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,That shake with tumult all the world....
9204,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"My lamp is set where love can see,"
9205,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Who through the tempest comes to me.
9206,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,
9207,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"I press my face against the pane,"
9208,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"And seem to see, from wood and plain,"
9209,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"In phantom thousands, stormy pale,"
9210,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"The ghosts of forests, tempest-slain,"
9211,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Vast wraiths of woodlands, rise and strain"
9212,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,And rock wild limbs against the gale;
9213,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Or, borne in fragments overhead,"
9214,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Sow night with horror and with dread....
9215,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,He comes! My light is as an arm
9216,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,To guide him onward through the storm.
9217,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,
9218,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,I hear the tempest from the sky
9219,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Cry, eagle-like, its battle-cry;"
9220,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"I hear the night, upon the peaks,"
9221,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Send back its condor-like reply;
9222,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,And then again come booming by
9223,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"The forest’s challenge, hoarse as speaks"
9224,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Hate unto hate, or wrath to wrath,"
9225,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,When each draws sword and sweeps the path.--
9226,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,But let them rage! through darkness far
9227,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,My bright light leads him like a star.
9228,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,
9229,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"The cliffs, with all their plumes of pines,"
9230,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Bow down high heads: the battle-lines
9231,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Of all the hills, that iron seams,"
9232,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Shudder through all their rocky spines:
9233,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,And under shields of matted vines
9234,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,The vales crouch down: and all the streams
9235,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Are hushed and frozen as with fear
9236,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,As from the deeps the winds draw near....
9237,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,But let them come! my lamp is lit!
9238,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Nor shall their fury flutter it.
9239,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,
9240,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"Now round and round, with stride on stride,"
9241,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"In Boreal armor, tempest-dyed,"
9242,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,I hear the thunder of their strokes--
9243,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,The heavens are rocked on every side
9244,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,With all their clouds; and far and wide
9245,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,The earth roars back with all its oaks....
9246,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Still at the pane burns bright my light
9247,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,"To guide him onward through the night,"
9248,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,To lead love through the night and storm
9249,THE LAMP AT THE WINDOW,Where my young heart will make him warm.

9261,ACHIEVEMENT,"So he wrought and he toiled and he waited,"
9262,ACHIEVEMENT,"Till he rose o’er the hordes that he hated,"
9263,ACHIEVEMENT,"And stood on the heights, as was fated,"
9264,ACHIEVEMENT,Made one of the great.
9265,ACHIEVEMENT,
9266,ACHIEVEMENT,"Then, lo! on the top of the mountain,"
9267,ACHIEVEMENT,"With walls that were wide,"
9268,ACHIEVEMENT,"A city! from which, like a fountain,"
9269,ACHIEVEMENT,Rose voices that cried:--
9270,ACHIEVEMENT,“He comes! Let us forth now to meet him!
9271,ACHIEVEMENT,Both mummer and priest let us greet him!

9274,ACHIEVEMENT,
9275,ACHIEVEMENT,"Then out of the city he builded,"
9276,ACHIEVEMENT,"Of shadows it seems,"
9277,ACHIEVEMENT,From gates that his fancy had gilded
9278,ACHIEVEMENT,"With thought’s brightest beams,"
9279,ACHIEVEMENT,"Strange mimes and chimeras came trooping,"
9280,ACHIEVEMENT,With moping and mowing and stooping--
9281,ACHIEVEMENT,"And he saw with a heart that was drooping,"
9282,ACHIEVEMENT,That these were his dreams.
9283,ACHIEVEMENT,
9284,ACHIEVEMENT,"He entered; and, lo! as he entered,"
9285,ACHIEVEMENT,They murmured his name;
9286,ACHIEVEMENT,"And led him where, burningly centered,"
9287,ACHIEVEMENT,An altar of flame
9288,ACHIEVEMENT,"Made lurid a temple,--erected"
9289,ACHIEVEMENT,"Of self,--where a form he detected--"
9290,ACHIEVEMENT,The love that his life had rejected ...
9291,ACHIEVEMENT,And this was his fame!

9306,MYSTERIES,
9307,MYSTERIES,"I gazed in her eyes, that were mossy green"
9308,MYSTERIES,As the rain that pools in the hollow between
9309,MYSTERIES,The twisted roots of a tree that towers;
9310,MYSTERIES,"And I saw the things that none has seen,--"
9311,MYSTERIES,"That mean far more than facts may mean,--"
9312,MYSTERIES,"The dreams, that are true, of an age that has been,"

9331,MYSTERIES,"I looked in her face, that was pale and still"
9332,MYSTERIES,As the moon that rises above the hill
9333,MYSTERIES,Where the pines loom sombre as sorrow:
9334,MYSTERIES,"And the things that all have known and will,"
9335,MYSTERIES,I knew for a moment--the myths that fill
9336,MYSTERIES,And people the past of the soul and thrill
9337,MYSTERIES,Its hope with a far to-morrow.
9338,MYSTERIES,
9339,MYSTERIES,"I heard her voice, that was strange with pain"
9340,MYSTERIES,As a wind that whispers of wreck and rain
9341,MYSTERIES,To the leaves of the autumn rustling lonely:
9342,MYSTERIES,And I felt the things that are felt in vain

9361,I,
9362,I,"Sing, Ho, a song of the winter dawn,"

9397,III,
9398,III,"Sing, Ho, a song of the winter morn,"

9658,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Booted and spurred he rode toward the west,"
9659,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"A rose, from the woman who loved him best,"
9660,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Lay warm with her kisses there in his breast,"
9661,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,And the battle beacons were burning.
9662,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9663,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"As over the draw he galloping went,"
9664,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"She, from the gateway’s battlement,"
9665,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,With a wafted kiss and a warning bent--
9666,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,“Beware of the ford at the turning!”
9667,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9668,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"An instant only he turned in his sell,"
9669,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And lightly fingered his petronel,"
9670,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Then settled his sword in its belt as well,"
9671,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,And the horns to battle were sounding.
9672,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9673,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"She watched till he reached the beacon there,"
9674,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And saw its gleam on his helm and hair,"
9675,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Then turned and murmured, “God keep thee, Clare!"
9676,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,From that wolf of the hills and his hounding.”
9677,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9678,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And on he rode till he came to the hill,"
9679,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Where the road turned off by the ruined mill,"
9680,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Where the stream flowed shallow and broad and still,"
9681,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,And the battle beacon was burning.
9682,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9683,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Into the river with little heed,"
9684,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,Down from the hill he galloped his steed--
9685,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"The water whispered on rock and reed,"
9686,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,“Death hides by the ford at the turning!”
9687,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9688,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And out of the night on the other side,"
9689,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Their helms and corselets dim descried,"
9690,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"He saw ten bandit troopers ride,"
9691,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,And the horns to battle were blaring.
9692,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9693,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Then he reined his steed in the middle ford,"
9694,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And glanced behind him and drew his sword,"
9695,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And laughed as he shouted his battle-word,"
9696,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,“Clare! Clare! and my steel needs airing!”
9697,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9698,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,Then down from the hills at his back there came
9699,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,Ten troopers more. With a face of flame
9700,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Red Hugh of the Hills led on the same,"
9701,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,In the glare of the beacon’s burning.
9702,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9703,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Again the cavalier turned and gazed,"
9704,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Then quick to his lips the rose he raised,"
9705,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And kissed it, crying, “Now God be praised!"
9706,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,And help her there when mourning!”
9707,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9708,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Then he rose in his stirrups and loosened rein,"
9709,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,And shouting his cry spurred on amain
9710,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Into the troopers to slay and be slain,"
9711,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,While the horns to battle were blowing.
9712,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9713,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"With ten behind him and ten before,"
9714,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And the battle beacon to light the shore,"
9715,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Small doubt of the end in his mind he bore,"
9716,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,With her rose in his bosom glowing.
9717,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9718,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"One trooper he slew with his petronel,"
9719,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And one with his sword when his good steed fell,"
9720,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"And they haled him, fighting, from horse and sell"
9721,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,In the light of the beacon’s burning.
9722,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,
9723,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,"Quoth Hugh of the Hills,--“To yonder tree"
9724,THE BALLAD OF THE ROSE,Now hang him high where she may see;

9741,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Of dawn, thy hearts fond love appears,"
9742,BERTRAND DE BORN,To cheer my life upon its way.
9743,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9744,BERTRAND DE BORN,Thine eyes! the daybreak of my heart!
9745,BERTRAND DE BORN,That give me strength to do and dare;
9746,BERTRAND DE BORN,Whose beauty is a radiant part
9747,BERTRAND DE BORN,Of all my songs; the music there;
9748,BERTRAND DE BORN,"The morning, that makes dim each care,"
9749,BERTRAND DE BORN,"And glorifies my mind’s dull mart,"
9750,BERTRAND DE BORN,And helps my soul to do and dare.
9751,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9752,BERTRAND DE BORN,"God, when He made thy fresh fair face,"
9753,BERTRAND DE BORN,"And thy young body, took the morn"
9754,BERTRAND DE BORN,"And made thee like a rose, whose race"
9755,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Is not of Earth; without a thorn,"
9756,BERTRAND DE BORN,And dewed thee with the joy that’s born
9757,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Of love, wherein hope hath its place"
9758,BERTRAND DE BORN,Like to the star that heralds morn.
9759,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9760,BERTRAND DE BORN,I go my way through town and thorp:
9761,BERTRAND DE BORN,In court and hall and castle bower
9762,BERTRAND DE BORN,I tune my lute and strike my harp:
9763,BERTRAND DE BORN,And often from some twilight tower
9764,BERTRAND DE BORN,"A lady drops to me a flower,"
9765,BERTRAND DE BORN,"That bids me scale the moat’s steep scarp,"
9766,BERTRAND DE BORN,And climb to love within her bower.
9767,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9768,BERTRAND DE BORN,"I heed them not, but go my ways:"
9769,BERTRAND DE BORN,What is their passion unto me!
9770,BERTRAND DE BORN,My songs are only in thy praise;
9771,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Thy face alone it is I see,"
9772,BERTRAND DE BORN,That fills my heart with melody--
9773,BERTRAND DE BORN,My sweet aubade! that makes my days
9774,BERTRAND DE BORN,"All music, singing here in me!"
9775,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9776,BERTRAND DE BORN,One time a foul knight in his towers
9777,BERTRAND DE BORN,Sneered thus: “God’s blood! why weary us
9778,BERTRAND DE BORN,With this one woman all our hours!--
9779,BERTRAND DE BORN,Sing of _our_ wenches! amorous
9780,BERTRAND DE BORN,Yolande and Ysoarde here!--Not thus
9781,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Shalt sing, but of _our_ paramours!--"
9782,BERTRAND DE BORN,What is thy Lady unto us!”
9783,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9784,BERTRAND DE BORN,And then I flung my lute aside;
9785,BERTRAND DE BORN,And from its baldric flew my sword;
9786,BERTRAND DE BORN,And down the hall ’twas but a stride;
9787,BERTRAND DE BORN,And in his brute face and its word
9788,BERTRAND DE BORN,My gauntlet; and around the board
9789,BERTRAND DE BORN,"The battle, till all wild-beast-eyed"
9790,BERTRAND DE BORN,He lay and at his throat my sword.
9791,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9792,BERTRAND DE BORN,Thou dost remember in Provence
9793,BERTRAND DE BORN,The vile thing that I slew; and how
9794,BERTRAND DE BORN,With my good jongleurs and my lance
9795,BERTRAND DE BORN,Kept back his horde!--The memory now
9796,BERTRAND DE BORN,Makes fierce my blood and hot my brow
9797,BERTRAND DE BORN,"With rage.--Ah, what a madman dance"
9798,BERTRAND DE BORN,"We led them, and escaped somehow!"
9799,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9800,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Oft times, when, in the tournament,"
9801,BERTRAND DE BORN,I see thee sitting yet uncrowned;
9802,BERTRAND DE BORN,"And bugles blow and spears are bent,"
9803,BERTRAND DE BORN,"And shields and falchions clash around,"
9804,BERTRAND DE BORN,And steeds go crashing to the ground;
9805,BERTRAND DE BORN,"And thou dost smile on me,--though spent"
9806,BERTRAND DE BORN,"With war, again my soul is crowned:"
9807,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9808,BERTRAND DE BORN,And I am fire to strike and slay;
9809,BERTRAND DE BORN,Before my face there comes a mist
9810,BERTRAND DE BORN,Of blood; and like a flame I play
9811,BERTRAND DE BORN,Through the loud lists; all who resist
9812,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Go down like corn; until thy wrist,"
9813,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Kneeling, I kiss; the wreath they lay"
9814,BERTRAND DE BORN,Of beauty on thy head’s gold mist.
9815,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9816,BERTRAND DE BORN,And then I seize my lute and sing
9817,BERTRAND DE BORN,Some chanson or some wild aubade
9818,BERTRAND DE BORN,Full of thy beauty and the swing
9819,BERTRAND DE BORN,Of swords and love which I have had
9820,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Of thee, until, with music mad,"
9821,BERTRAND DE BORN,The lists reel with thy name and ring
9822,BERTRAND DE BORN,The echoed words of my aubade.
9823,BERTRAND DE BORN,
9824,BERTRAND DE BORN,"I am thy knight and troubadour,"
9825,BERTRAND DE BORN,"Bertrand de Born, whom naught shall part"

10141,THE WILLOW WATER,"Bee-shaken pollen from the voluble bough,"

10418,I,"A giant head dark as congested blood,"
10419,I,"The gum-tree towers, against the sky a stroke"
10420,I,Of purpling gold; and every blur of wood

10429,II,Where Magic waved her wand
10430,II,"And dimmed the air with dreams my boyhood knew,"
10431,II,Enchantment met me; and again she bent
10432,II,"Her face to mine, and smiled with eyes of blue,"
10433,II,And kissed me on the mouth and bade me heed
10434,II,Old tales again from books no man may read.

10441,III,With hair of wavy gold
10442,III,A presence walked there; and its beauty was
10443,III,The beauty not of Earth: and then I heard
10444,III,"Within my heart vague voices, murmurous"
10445,III,And multitudinous as leaves that sow
10446,III,The firmament when winds of autumn blow.

10455,IV,"The child-soul of the world that once believed,"

10501,III,Weep at my close-shut door:
10502,III,"And its voice, so it seemed, as it sorrowed there,"

11264,THE JONGLEUR,"Of sackbut and recorder, everywhere"
11265,THE JONGLEUR,Shattered the night; then on a sudden thinned
11266,THE JONGLEUR,To bagpipe wailings as of maniac grief

11268,THE JONGLEUR,"Out in the darkness, mediæval-dim,"
11269,THE JONGLEUR,"I saw him dancing, like an autumn leaf,"

11271,THE JONGLEUR,His lute’s wild ribbons ’thwart the moon’s low rim.

11280,OLD SIR JOHN,Into the Boar’s Head Inn: the hot sweat streaks
11281,OLD SIR JOHN,"His fulvous face, and all his raiment reeks"
11282,OLD SIR JOHN,Of all the stews and all the Eastcheap slums.
11283,OLD SIR JOHN,Upon the battered board again he drums
11284,OLD SIR JOHN,"And croaks for sack: then sits, his harsh-haired cheeks"
11285,OLD SIR JOHN,"Sunk in his hands, rough with the grime of weeks,"
11286,OLD SIR JOHN,While round the tap one great bluebottle hums.
11287,OLD SIR JOHN,"All, all are gone, the old companions--they"
11288,OLD SIR JOHN,Who made his rogue’s world merry: of them all
11289,OLD SIR JOHN,"Not one is left. Old, toothless now, and gray,"
11290,OLD SIR JOHN,Alone he waits: the swagger of that day

11302,IN AGES PAST,And with the sound I seemed to see long lines
11303,IN AGES PAST,"Of mountains rise, blue peak on cloudy blue,"
11304,IN AGES PAST,And hear the roar of torrents hurling through
11305,IN AGES PAST,Riven ravines; or from the crags’ gaunt spines
11306,IN AGES PAST,"Pouring wild hair, where,--as an eyeball shines,--"
11307,IN AGES PAST,"A mountain pool shone, clear and cold of hue."
11308,IN AGES PAST,"And then my soul remembered--felt, how once,"
11309,IN AGES PAST,"In ages past, ’twas here that I, a Faun,"
11310,IN AGES PAST,"Startled an Oread at her morning bath,"
11311,IN AGES PAST,"Who stood revealed; her beauty, like the sun’s,"
11312,IN AGES PAST,"Veiled in her hair, heavy with dews of dawn,"

11325,THE MISER,A chest he hugs wherein he hoards his gold.
11326,THE MISER,Far-heard a bell of midnight slowly tolls:
11327,THE MISER,"The bleak blasts shake his hut like wailing souls,"
11328,THE MISER,And door and window chatter with the cold.
