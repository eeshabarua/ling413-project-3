47,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
48,PREFACE.,
49,PREFACE.,
50,PREFACE.,"The numerous collections of American verse share, I think, one fault in"
51,PREFACE.,common: they include too much. Whether this has been a bid for
52,PREFACE.,"popularity, a concession to Philistia, I cannot say; but the fact"
53,PREFACE.,"remains that all anthologies of American poetry are, so far as I know,"
54,PREFACE.,more or less uncritical. The aim of the present book is different. In no
55,PREFACE.,case has a poem been included because it is widely known. The purpose of
56,PREFACE.,"this compilation is solely that of preserving, in attractive and"
57,PREFACE.,"permanent form, about one hundred and fifty of the best lyrics of"
58,PREFACE.,America.
59,PREFACE.,
60,PREFACE.,I am quite aware of the danger attending such exacting honor-rolls. At
61,PREFACE.,"best, an editor's judgment is only personal, and the realization of this"
62,PREFACE.,fact gives me no small diffidence in attempting to decide what American
63,PREFACE.,lyrics are best worthy of preservation. That every reader of the
64,PREFACE.,"""American Treasury"" will find some favorite poem omitted, there can be"
65,PREFACE.,little doubt. But the effort made in this book towards a careful
66,PREFACE.,"estimate of our lyrical poetry is at any rate, I feel sure, in a good"
67,PREFACE.,direction.
68,PREFACE.,
69,PREFACE.,"There appear in the index of Mr. Stedman's ""Poets of America"" the names"
70,PREFACE.,of over three hundred native writers. American verse in the last half
71,PREFACE.,century has been extraordinarily prolific. It would seem that the time
72,PREFACE.,"has come, in the course of our national literature, for proving all"
73,PREFACE.,things and holding fast that which is good.
74,PREFACE.,
75,PREFACE.,The fact that the title of this compilation instantly calls to mind that
76,PREFACE.,of Mr. Palgrave's scholarly collection of English lyrics need not prove
77,PREFACE.,a disadvantage to the book if the purpose which led to the choice of
78,PREFACE.,name is understood. The verse of a single century produced in a new
79,PREFACE.,country should not be expected to equal the poetic wealth of an old and
80,PREFACE.,intellectual nation. But if American poetry cannot hope to rival the
81,PREFACE.,"poetry of the mother country, it may at least be compared with it; and"
82,PREFACE.,the fact of such a comparative point of view will aid rather than hinder
83,PREFACE.,the student of our native poetry in estimating its value.
84,PREFACE.,
85,PREFACE.,American verse has suffered at the hands both of its admirers and its
86,PREFACE.,"enemies. Injudicious praise, no less than supercilious contempt, has"
87,PREFACE.,reacted unfavorably on the fame of our poets. Again and again has some
88,PREFACE.,"minor versifier been hailed as the ""American Keats"" or the ""American"
89,PREFACE.,"Burns."" Really excellent poets, though distinctly poets of second rank,"
90,PREFACE.,have been elevated amid the blare of critical trumpets to the company of
91,PREFACE.,Wordsworth and Milton. All this is unprofitable and silly. But not much
92,PREFACE.,better is the attitude of certain critics who patronize everything in
93,PREFACE.,the English language which has been written outside of England. Though
94,PREFACE.,America has added--leaving Poe out of account--no distinctly new notes
95,PREFACE.,"to English poetry, it has added certainly not a few true ones. A nation"
96,PREFACE.,need never apologize for its literature when it has produced such
97,PREFACE.,"lyrics--to go no further--as ""On a Bust of Dante,"" ""Ichabod,"" ""The"
98,PREFACE.,"Chambered Nautilus,"" and the ""Waterfowl."""
99,PREFACE.,
100,PREFACE.,"My method of arrangement is roughly chronological. The First Book, which"
101,PREFACE.,"is shorter than the others, might be called the book of Bryant; the"
102,PREFACE.,"Second, of Longfellow; and the Third, of Aldrich. Since the periods must"
103,PREFACE.,"of course overlap, this division of the poems can be at most only"
104,PREFACE.,suggestive.
105,PREFACE.,
106,PREFACE.,I have made it no part of my design to grant to the better known poets a
107,PREFACE.,larger number of lyrics than those given later and younger men. I have
108,PREFACE.,"paid no regard to that purely conventional idea of proportion, that"
109,PREFACE.,"would assign to five or six writers a dozen selections each, and to"
110,PREFACE.,"another set of poets, in proportion to their popular fame, half that"
111,PREFACE.,number. We can safely leave the final adjustment of all rival claims to
112,PREFACE.,"Time, the best critic; in the meanwhile having the more modest aim of"
113,PREFACE.,"selecting, irrespective of contemporary judgments, whatever is best"
114,PREFACE.,suited to our purpose.
115,PREFACE.,
116,PREFACE.,A word more should be said about the title. I have not interpreted the
117,PREFACE.,"term lyric so rigidly as to exclude sonnets, ballads, elegiac verse, or"
118,PREFACE.,even pieces of almost pure description. If I had held to the strictest
119,PREFACE.,"sense of lyric, this book would never have been compiled; for I suspect"
120,PREFACE.,"nothing will strike the reader more forcibly than the fact that, despite"
121,PREFACE.,"the excellence of the poems included, there is a notable lack of"
122,PREFACE.,unconsciousness--of pure singing quality. Such things as Pinkney's
123,PREFACE.,"""Health"" and Holmes's ""Old Ironsides"" are the exception. The poems are"
124,PREFACE.,"composed cleverly, but they do not quite sing themselves to their own"
125,PREFACE.,"music. The best American verse, while not insincere, is seldom wholly"
126,PREFACE.,spontaneous. This is not saying that much spontaneous verse has not been
127,PREFACE.,"written in this country; much has been, but the singer's voice has too"
128,PREFACE.,"often been uncultivated, and the product inartistic."
129,PREFACE.,
130,PREFACE.,"The names of many popular poets are entirely omitted. In no case,"
131,PREFACE.,"however, was this probably due to oversight. I have gone over carefully"
132,PREFACE.,"a wide field of verse, not without finding much to admire, but never"
133,PREFACE.,quite happening upon that final touch of successful achievement where
134,PREFACE.,art and inspiration join. I am especially sorry to leave unrepresented
135,PREFACE.,"a writer--more imaginative, possibly, than any American poet except"
136,PREFACE.,Poe--whose utter contempt for technique in the ordinary sense places him
137,PREFACE.,wholly outside my present purpose.
138,PREFACE.,
139,PREFACE.,I wish to acknowledge various favors kindly shown by Professor C.T.
140,PREFACE.,"Winchester, Professor Barrett Wendell, and Mr. H.E. Scudder. Thanks are"
141,PREFACE.,also due Mr. T.B. Aldrich for the privilege of including the six poems
142,PREFACE.,"from his pen, which were kindly selected for the book by the poet"
143,PREFACE.,himself. The following firms deserve thanks for permitting the use of
144,PREFACE.,copyrighted poems:

711,S. WOODWORTH.,"I was a child and she was a child,"

722,S. WOODWORTH.,So that her highborn kinsmen came
723,S. WOODWORTH.,"And bore her away from me,"
724,S. WOODWORTH.,To shut her up in a sepulchre
725,S. WOODWORTH.,In this kingdom by the sea.
726,S. WOODWORTH.,
727,S. WOODWORTH.,"The angels, not half so happy in heaven,"

1477,W.C. BRYANT.,"Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,--"
1478,W.C. BRYANT.,"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
1479,W.C. BRYANT.,As of some one gently rapping--rapping at my chamber door.
1480,W.C. BRYANT.,"""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door,--"
1481,W.C. BRYANT.,"Only this, and nothing more."""
1482,W.C. BRYANT.,
1483,W.C. BRYANT.,"Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,"
1484,W.C. BRYANT.,And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
1485,W.C. BRYANT.,Eagerly I wished the morrow;--vainly I had sought to borrow
1486,W.C. BRYANT.,"From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore,--"
1487,W.C. BRYANT.,"For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,--"
1488,W.C. BRYANT.,Nameless here forevermore.
1489,W.C. BRYANT.,
1490,W.C. BRYANT.,And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
1491,W.C. BRYANT.,Thrilled me--filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
1492,W.C. BRYANT.,"So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating"
1493,W.C. BRYANT.,"""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,"
1494,W.C. BRYANT.,--Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;--
1495,W.C. BRYANT.,"This it is, and nothing more."""
1496,W.C. BRYANT.,
1497,W.C. BRYANT.,"Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"
1498,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;"
1499,W.C. BRYANT.,"But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,"
1500,W.C. BRYANT.,"And so faintly you came tapping--tapping at my chamber door,"
1501,W.C. BRYANT.,"That I scarce was sure I heard you;""--here I opened wide the door:--"
1502,W.C. BRYANT.,"Darkness there, and nothing more."
1503,W.C. BRYANT.,
1504,W.C. BRYANT.,"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,"
1505,W.C. BRYANT.,"Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;"
1506,W.C. BRYANT.,"But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,"
1507,W.C. BRYANT.,"And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore?"""
1508,W.C. BRYANT.,"This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore:"""
1509,W.C. BRYANT.,"Merely this, and nothing more."
1510,W.C. BRYANT.,
1511,W.C. BRYANT.,"Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
1512,W.C. BRYANT.,Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
1513,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice;"
1514,W.C. BRYANT.,"Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore,--"
1515,W.C. BRYANT.,Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;--
1516,W.C. BRYANT.,"'Tis the wind, and nothing more."""
1517,W.C. BRYANT.,
1518,W.C. BRYANT.,"Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,"
1519,W.C. BRYANT.,In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
1520,W.C. BRYANT.,Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
1521,W.C. BRYANT.,"But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door--"
1522,W.C. BRYANT.,Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door--
1523,W.C. BRYANT.,"Perched, and sat, and nothing more."
1524,W.C. BRYANT.,
1525,W.C. BRYANT.,Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
1526,W.C. BRYANT.,"By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"
1527,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure"
1528,W.C. BRYANT.,"no craven,"
1529,W.C. BRYANT.,"Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore,--"
1530,W.C. BRYANT.,"Tell, me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"""
1531,W.C. BRYANT.,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
1532,W.C. BRYANT.,
1533,W.C. BRYANT.,"Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
1534,W.C. BRYANT.,Though its answer little meaning--little relevancy bore;
1535,W.C. BRYANT.,For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
1536,W.C. BRYANT.,Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door--
1537,W.C. BRYANT.,"Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,"
1538,W.C. BRYANT.,"With such name as ""Nevermore."""
1539,W.C. BRYANT.,
1540,W.C. BRYANT.,"But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only"
1541,W.C. BRYANT.,"That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour."
1542,W.C. BRYANT.,Nothing further then he uttered--not a feather then he fluttered--
1543,W.C. BRYANT.,"Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""Other friends have flown before--"
1544,W.C. BRYANT.,"On the morrow _he_ will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."""
1545,W.C. BRYANT.,"Then the bird said, ""Nevermore."""
1546,W.C. BRYANT.,
1547,W.C. BRYANT.,"Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
1548,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,"
1549,W.C. BRYANT.,Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
1550,W.C. BRYANT.,"Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore,"
1551,W.C. BRYANT.,Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
1552,W.C. BRYANT.,"Of 'Never--nevermore.'"""
1553,W.C. BRYANT.,
1554,W.C. BRYANT.,"But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,"
1555,W.C. BRYANT.,Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
1556,W.C. BRYANT.,"Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking"
1557,W.C. BRYANT.,"Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore--"
1558,W.C. BRYANT.,"What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore"
1559,W.C. BRYANT.,"Meant in croaking ""Nevermore."""
1560,W.C. BRYANT.,
1561,W.C. BRYANT.,"This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
1562,W.C. BRYANT.,To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
1563,W.C. BRYANT.,"This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
1564,W.C. BRYANT.,"On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,"
1565,W.C. BRYANT.,But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er
1566,W.C. BRYANT.,"_She_ shall press, ah, nevermore!"
1567,W.C. BRYANT.,
1568,W.C. BRYANT.,"Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
1569,W.C. BRYANT.,Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
1570,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee--by these angels He hath"
1571,W.C. BRYANT.,sent thee
1572,W.C. BRYANT.,Respite--respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
1573,W.C. BRYANT.,"Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"""
1574,W.C. BRYANT.,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
1575,W.C. BRYANT.,
1576,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!--"
1577,W.C. BRYANT.,"Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,"
1578,W.C. BRYANT.,"Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted--"
1579,W.C. BRYANT.,"On this home by Horror haunted--tell me truly, I implore,--"
1580,W.C. BRYANT.,"Is there,--_is_ there balm in Gilead?--tell me--tell me, I implore!"""
1581,W.C. BRYANT.,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
1582,W.C. BRYANT.,
1583,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!--prophet still, if bird or devil!"
1584,W.C. BRYANT.,By that Heaven that bends above us--by that God we both adore--
1585,W.C. BRYANT.,"Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,"
1586,W.C. BRYANT.,It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore--
1587,W.C. BRYANT.,"Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore."""
1588,W.C. BRYANT.,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
1589,W.C. BRYANT.,
1590,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"" I shrieked,"
1591,W.C. BRYANT.,"upstarting,--"
1592,W.C. BRYANT.,"""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!"
1593,W.C. BRYANT.,Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
1594,W.C. BRYANT.,Leave my loneliness unbroken!--quit the bust above my door!
1595,W.C. BRYANT.,"Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"""
1596,W.C. BRYANT.,"Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore."""
1597,W.C. BRYANT.,
1598,W.C. BRYANT.,"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting"
1599,W.C. BRYANT.,On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
1600,W.C. BRYANT.,"And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,"
1601,W.C. BRYANT.,And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;

1830,J.R. LOWELL.,"A feeling of sadness and longing,"

1855,J.R. LOWELL.,"Who, through long days of labor,"
1856,J.R. LOWELL.,"And nights devoid of ease,"
1857,J.R. LOWELL.,Still heard in his soul the music
1858,J.R. LOWELL.,Of wonderful melodies.

1860,J.R. LOWELL.,Such songs have power to quiet
1861,J.R. LOWELL.,"The restless pulse of care,"

3459,J. ALDRICH.,
3460,J. ALDRICH.,
3461,J. ALDRICH.,Here is the place; right over the hill
3462,J. ALDRICH.,Runs the path I took;
3463,J. ALDRICH.,"You can see the gap in the old wall still,"
3464,J. ALDRICH.,And the stepping-stones in the shallow brook.
3465,J. ALDRICH.,
3466,J. ALDRICH.,"There is the house, with the gate red-barred,"
3467,J. ALDRICH.,And the poplars tall;
3468,J. ALDRICH.,"And the barn's brown length, and the cattle-yard,"
3469,J. ALDRICH.,And the white horns tossing above the wall.
3470,J. ALDRICH.,
3471,J. ALDRICH.,There are the beehives ranged in the sun;
3472,J. ALDRICH.,And down by the brink
3473,J. ALDRICH.,"Of the brook are her poor flowers, weed-o'errun,--"
3474,J. ALDRICH.,"Pansy and daffodil, rose and pink."
3475,J. ALDRICH.,
3476,J. ALDRICH.,"A year has gone, as the tortoise goes,"
3477,J. ALDRICH.,Heavy and slow;
3478,J. ALDRICH.,"And the same rose blows, and the same sun glows,"
3479,J. ALDRICH.,And the same brook sings of a year ago.
3480,J. ALDRICH.,
3481,J. ALDRICH.,There's the same sweet clover-smell in the breeze;
3482,J. ALDRICH.,And the June sun warm
3483,J. ALDRICH.,"Tangles his wings of fire in the trees,"

3490,J. ALDRICH.,
3491,J. ALDRICH.,"Since we parted, a month had passed,--"
3492,J. ALDRICH.,"To love, a year;"
3493,J. ALDRICH.,Down through the beeches I looked at last
3494,J. ALDRICH.,On the little red gate and the well-sweep near.
3495,J. ALDRICH.,
3496,J. ALDRICH.,"I can see it all now,--the slantwise rain"
3497,J. ALDRICH.,"Of light through the leaves,"
3498,J. ALDRICH.,"The sundown's blaze on her window-pane,"
3499,J. ALDRICH.,The bloom of her roses under the eaves.

3501,J. ALDRICH.,"Just the same as a month before,--"
3502,J. ALDRICH.,"The house and the trees,"
3503,J. ALDRICH.,"The barn's brown gable, the vine by the door,--"
3504,J. ALDRICH.,Nothing changed but the hives of bees.
3505,J. ALDRICH.,
3506,J. ALDRICH.,"Before them, under the garden wall,"
3507,J. ALDRICH.,"Forward and back,"
3508,J. ALDRICH.,"Went, drearily singing, the chore-girl small,"
3509,J. ALDRICH.,Draping each hive with a shred of black.
3510,J. ALDRICH.,
3511,J. ALDRICH.,"Trembling, I listened; the summer sun"
3512,J. ALDRICH.,Had the chill of snow;
3513,J. ALDRICH.,For I knew she was telling the bees of one
3514,J. ALDRICH.,Gone on the journey we all must go!
3515,J. ALDRICH.,
3516,J. ALDRICH.,"Then I said to myself, ""My Mary weeps"

3521,J. ALDRICH.,"But her dog whined low; on the doorway sill,"
3522,J. ALDRICH.,"With his cane to his chin,"
3523,J. ALDRICH.,The old man sat; and the chore-girl still
3524,J. ALDRICH.,Sung to the bees stealing out and in.
3525,J. ALDRICH.,
3526,J. ALDRICH.,And the song she was singing ever since
3527,J. ALDRICH.,In my ear sounds on:

3546,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Some English sunshine, warmth, and air!"
3547,J.G. WHITTIER.,"I cannot tell,--but here to-day,"
3548,J.G. WHITTIER.,A thousand billowy leagues away
3549,J.G. WHITTIER.,From that green isle whose twilight skies
3550,J.G. WHITTIER.,"No darker are than Katie's eyes,"
3551,J.G. WHITTIER.,"She seems to me, go where she will,"
3552,J.G. WHITTIER.,An English girl in England still!
3553,J.G. WHITTIER.,
3554,J.G. WHITTIER.,"I meet her on the dusty street,"
3555,J.G. WHITTIER.,And daisies spring about her feet;
3556,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Or, touched to life beneath her tread,"
3557,J.G. WHITTIER.,An English cowslip lifts its head;
3558,J.G. WHITTIER.,"And, as to do her grace, rise up"
3559,J.G. WHITTIER.,The primrose and the buttercup!
3560,J.G. WHITTIER.,"I roam with her through fields of cane,"
3561,J.G. WHITTIER.,"And seem to stroll an English lane,"
3562,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Which, white with blossoms of the May,"
3563,J.G. WHITTIER.,Spreads its green carpet in her way!
3564,J.G. WHITTIER.,"As fancy wills, the path beneath"
3565,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Is golden gorse, or purple heath;"
3566,J.G. WHITTIER.,And now we hear in woodlands dim
3567,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Their unarticulated hymn,"
3568,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Now walk through rippling waves of wheat,"
3569,J.G. WHITTIER.,"Now sink in mats of clover sweet,"
3570,J.G. WHITTIER.,Or see before us from the lawn
3571,J.G. WHITTIER.,The lark go up to greet the dawn!
3572,J.G. WHITTIER.,All birds that love the English sky
3573,J.G. WHITTIER.,Throng round my path when she is by;
3574,J.G. WHITTIER.,The blackbird from a neighboring thorn
3575,J.G. WHITTIER.,"With music brims the cup of morn,"
3576,J.G. WHITTIER.,"And in a thick, melodious rain"
3577,J.G. WHITTIER.,The mavis pours her mellow strain!
3578,J.G. WHITTIER.,But only when my Katie's voice

3593,H. TIMROD.,"Her glorious fancies come from far,"
3594,H. TIMROD.,"Beneath the silver evening-star,"
3595,H. TIMROD.,And yet her heart is ever near.
3596,H. TIMROD.,
3597,H. TIMROD.,"Great feelings hath she of her own,"
3598,H. TIMROD.,Which lesser souls may never know;
3599,H. TIMROD.,"God giveth them to her alone,"

3602,H. TIMROD.,
3603,H. TIMROD.,"Yet in herself she dwelleth not,"
3604,H. TIMROD.,Although no home were half so fair;
3605,H. TIMROD.,No simplest duty is forgot;
3606,H. TIMROD.,Life hath no dim and lowly spot
3607,H. TIMROD.,That doth not in her sunshine share.
3608,H. TIMROD.,
3609,H. TIMROD.,"She doeth little kindnesses,"
3610,H. TIMROD.,"Which most leave undone, or despise;"
3611,H. TIMROD.,"For naught that sets one heart at ease,"
3612,H. TIMROD.,"And giveth happiness or peace,"
3613,H. TIMROD.,Is low-esteemèd in her eyes.
3614,H. TIMROD.,
3615,H. TIMROD.,"She hath no scorn of common things,"

3620,H. TIMROD.,
3621,H. TIMROD.,"Blessing she is; God made her so,"
3622,H. TIMROD.,And deeds of week-day holiness
3623,H. TIMROD.,"Fall from her noiseless as the snow,"
3624,H. TIMROD.,Nor hath she ever chanced to know
3625,H. TIMROD.,That aught were easier than to bless.
3626,H. TIMROD.,
3627,H. TIMROD.,"She is most fair, and thereunto"
3628,H. TIMROD.,Her life doth rightly harmonize;
3629,H. TIMROD.,Feeling or thought that was not true
3630,H. TIMROD.,Ne'er made less beautiful the blue
3631,H. TIMROD.,Unclouded heaven of her eyes.
3632,H. TIMROD.,
3633,H. TIMROD.,She is a woman; one in whom
3634,H. TIMROD.,The spring-time of her childish years
3635,H. TIMROD.,"Hath never lost its fresh perfume,"
3636,H. TIMROD.,Though knowing well that life hath room
3637,H. TIMROD.,For many blights and many tears.
3638,H. TIMROD.,
3639,H. TIMROD.,I love her with a love as still
3640,H. TIMROD.,"As a broad river's peaceful might,"
3641,H. TIMROD.,"Which, by high tower and lowly mill,"
3642,H. TIMROD.,"Goes wandering at its own will,"
3643,H. TIMROD.,And yet doth ever flow aright.
3644,H. TIMROD.,
3645,H. TIMROD.,"And, on its full, deep breast serene,"
3646,H. TIMROD.,Like quiet isles my duties lie;
3647,H. TIMROD.,"It flows around them and between,"
3648,H. TIMROD.,"And makes them fresh, and fair, and green,"
3649,H. TIMROD.,Sweet homes wherein to live and die.

5717,E. FIELD.,
5718,E. FIELD.,And through my chilling veins shall flame
5719,E. FIELD.,"My love, as though beneath her breath;"
5720,E. FIELD.,"And in her voice but call my name,"

5738,H.C. BUNNER.,"Shone, softened with a phosphor glow"
5739,H.C. BUNNER.,"Of sympathetic light,"
5740,H.C. BUNNER.,And that her fledgling spirit pure
5741,H.C. BUNNER.,Was pluming fast for flight.
5742,H.C. BUNNER.,
5743,H.C. BUNNER.,Each tendril throbbed and quickened
5744,H.C. BUNNER.,"As I nightly climbed apace,"
5745,H.C. BUNNER.,And could scarce restrain the blossoms
5746,H.C. BUNNER.,"When, anear the destined place,"
5747,H.C. BUNNER.,Her gentle whisper thrilled me
5748,H.C. BUNNER.,Ere I gazed upon her face.

5750,H.C. BUNNER.,"I waited, darkling, till the dawn"

5770,J.B. TABB.,"There is rust upon locks and hinges,"

5779,J.B. TABB.,
5780,J.B. TABB.,"With lilies on brow and bosom,"

5785,J.B. TABB.,"Red roses she left behind her,"

5790,J.B. TABB.,The garments she left mock the shadows
5791,J.B. TABB.,"With hints of womanly grace,"

5794,J.B. TABB.,
5795,J.B. TABB.,The birds make insolent music
5796,J.B. TABB.,"Where the sunshine riots outside,"

5845,L.C. MOULTON.,When you blink at its arch sprung over
5846,L.C. MOULTON.,Where in the grass you lie.
5847,L.C. MOULTON.,
5848,L.C. MOULTON.,Dimly an orange bit of rainbow

5863,L.C. MOULTON.,"What would the great world lose, I wonder--"

5984,T.B. ALDRICH.,
5985,T.B. ALDRICH.,"There was a time, when life was new--"
5986,T.B. ALDRICH.,"But far away, and half forgot--"
5987,T.B. ALDRICH.,I only know her eyes were blue;
5988,T.B. ALDRICH.,But Love--I fear I knew it not.
5989,T.B. ALDRICH.,"We did not wed, for lack of gold,"

6006,T.B. ALDRICH.,"_Oh, past this poor horizon's bound_"
6007,T.B. ALDRICH.,_My song goes straight to one who stands--_
6008,T.B. ALDRICH.,_Her face all gladdening at the sound--_
6009,T.B. ALDRICH.,"_To lead me to the Spring-green lands,_"
6010,T.B. ALDRICH.,_To wander with enlacing hands._

7280,NOTES.,"exceptions, it must be looked for by the curious student in the"
7281,NOTES.,"graveyard of old anthologies. Who now reads ""The Simple Cobbler of"
7282,NOTES.,"Agawam in America,"" ""The Tenth Muse Lately Sprung up in America,"" ""The"
7283,NOTES.,"Day of Doom,"" ""M'Fingal,"" or ""The Columbiad?"" Skipping a generation from"
7284,NOTES.,"Barlow's death, who reads with much seriousness any one of the group of"
7285,NOTES.,"poets of which Bryant in his earliest period was the centre: Halleck,"
7286,NOTES.,"Pierpont, Sprague, Drake, Dana, Percival, Allston, Brainard, Mrs."
7287,NOTES.,"Osgood, and Miss Brooks? A few of them, to be sure, are remembered by an"
7288,NOTES.,"occasional lyric,--Halleck by ""Marco Bozzaris,"" a spirited ode in the"
7289,NOTES.,"manner of Campbell; Pierpont by his ringing lines, ""Warren's Address to"
7290,NOTES.,"the American Soldiers;"" Drake by ""The American Flag,"" conventional but"
7291,NOTES.,"not commonplace, and marked by one very imaginative line; and Allston by"
7292,NOTES.,"two rather excellent lyrics, ""Rosalie"" and ""America to Great Britain."""
7293,NOTES.,The first poet to accomplish work of high sustained excellence was
7294,NOTES.,"Bryant. His poetry, though never impassioned, is uniformly elegant. It"
7295,NOTES.,is often as chaste as Landor at his best. But it never surprises; it is
7296,NOTES.,"not emotional, personal, suggestively imaginative. In fact, Bryant's"
7297,NOTES.,"muse is not lyrical. With the exception of Pinkney and Hoffman, whose"
7298,NOTES.,"""Sparkling and Bright,"" if technically defective, is a true song, we"
7299,NOTES.,"must wait for our lyric poet till we reach Edgar Allan Poe, the"
7300,NOTES.,greatest--one inclines to say the only--master of musical quality in
7301,NOTES.,verse whom America has produced.
7302,NOTES.,
7303,NOTES.,"_The Wild Honeysuckle._--Philip Freneau, born in 1752, was a soldier in"
7304,NOTES.,the American Revolution. Though never rising quite into the highest
7305,NOTES.,"class of poets, he is our first genuine singer. ""The Indian"
7306,NOTES.,"Burying-ground"" and ""To a Honey-bee"" are only less successful than the"
7307,NOTES.,graceful lines quoted.
7308,NOTES.,
7309,NOTES.,_A Health._--Poe was an enthusiastic admirer of this poem. He pronounced
7310,NOTES.,"it, in his essay entitled ""The Poetic Principle,"" ""full of brilliancy"
7311,NOTES.,"and spirit,"" and added: ""It was the misfortune of Mr. Pinkney to have"
7312,NOTES.,"been born too far south. Had he been a New Englander, it is probable"
7313,NOTES.,that he would have been ranked as the first of American lyrists by that
7314,NOTES.,magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of American
7315,NOTES.,"Letters, in conducting the thing called _The North American Review_."""
7316,NOTES.,"This passage, very characteristic of Poe's criticisms, illustrates both"
7317,NOTES.,"his championship of favorites, and unmerciful scourging of foes."
7318,NOTES.,
7319,NOTES.,"_Unseen Spirits._--The earnest sincerity, evident in every line of this"
7320,NOTES.,"poem, removes it at once from the company of those gay society verses"
7321,NOTES.,sparkling with conceits which won for Willis the satiric comment of
7322,NOTES.,"Lowell in ""A Fable for Critics:"""
7323,NOTES.,
7324,NOTES.,"""There is Willis, all natty, and jaunty, and gay,"
7325,NOTES.,"Who says his best things in so foppish a way,"
7326,NOTES.,"With conceits and pet phrases so thickly o'erlaying 'em,"
7327,NOTES.,That one hardly knows whether to thank him for saying 'em;
7328,NOTES.,"Over-ornament ruins both poem and prose,--"
7329,NOTES.,"Just conceive of a Muse with a ring in her nose!"""
7330,NOTES.,
7331,NOTES.,"Had Willis written more such lyrics as ""Unseen Spirits,"" his fame could"
7332,NOTES.,"hardly have proved so ephemeral. Poe considered this poem Willis's best,"
7333,NOTES.,and I see no ground for calling the critic's judgment in question.
7334,NOTES.,
7335,NOTES.,"_To Helen._--This brief lyric, written in the poet's youth, is not only"
7336,NOTES.,"among the most exquisite from his pen, but it furnishes one of the most"
7337,NOTES.,famous among current quotations:
7338,NOTES.,
7339,NOTES.,"""The glory that was Greece,"
7340,NOTES.,"And the grandeur that was Rome."""
7341,NOTES.,
7342,NOTES.,_On the Death of Joseph Rodman Drake._--These manly lines have yielded
7343,NOTES.,another phrase to the world's memory. Hardly any quotation is more
7344,NOTES.,hackneyed than the last two verses of the first stanza. Drake was a
7345,NOTES.,"young poet, the intimate friend and literary co-laborer of Halleck, who"
7346,NOTES.,"died September, 1820, in his twenty-fifth year."
7347,NOTES.,
7348,NOTES.,_To the Fringed Gentian._--This lyric well illustrates what Mr. Stedman
7349,NOTES.,"has aptly termed Bryant's ""Doric simplicity."" Nothing of Wordsworth's is"
7350,NOTES.,freer from ornament or from the least trace of affectation.
7351,NOTES.,
7352,NOTES.,"_The Raven._--Though not belonging to the highest order of poetry, ""The"
7353,NOTES.,"Raven"" still maintains its position at the head of its class. No more"
7354,NOTES.,astonishing _tour de force_ can be found in English literature.
7355,NOTES.,
7356,NOTES.,"_Nature._--Generally regarded, I think, the finest of Longfellow's, if"
7357,NOTES.,"not of American, sonnets."
7358,NOTES.,
7359,NOTES.,_Ichabod._--Occasioned by the defection and fall of Daniel Webster. It
7360,NOTES.,"is worthy a place by the side of Browning's ""Lost Leader."" In later"
7361,NOTES.,"years, Whittier wrote a poem on the theme, which, while not a retraction"
7362,NOTES.,"of his former position, is penned in a tenderer, more tolerant mood,"
7363,NOTES.,"""The Lost Occasion"" is its title, and it is only just to the poet to"
7364,NOTES.,"read this second lyric, hardly less successful, in connection with the"
7365,NOTES.,first.
7366,NOTES.,
7367,NOTES.,"_Old Ironsides._--""Old Ironsides"" was the popular name for the frigate"
7368,NOTES.,_Constitution_. Dr. Holmes's poem appeared in the Boston _Advertiser_
7369,NOTES.,"""at the time when it was proposed to break up the old ship as unfit for"
7370,NOTES.,"service."""
7371,NOTES.,
7372,NOTES.,"_Bedouin Song._--One of the most spirited, most genuinely lyrical of"
7373,NOTES.,American poems.
7374,NOTES.,
7375,NOTES.,"_Skipper Ireson's Ride._--These lines have an easy, swinging quality"
7376,NOTES.,"that is quite inimitable. One inclines to agree with Mr. Stedman: ""Of"
7377,NOTES.,"all our poets he (Whittier) is the most natural balladist."""
7378,NOTES.,
7379,NOTES.,"_The Village Blacksmith._--The directness and homely strength of ""The"
7380,NOTES.,"Village Blacksmith"" have made it deservedly popular. One questions"
7381,NOTES.,whether the last stanza might not have been omitted with advantage both
7382,NOTES.,to the unity and force of the poem.
7383,NOTES.,
7384,NOTES.,_The Last Leaf._--This masterpiece of mingled humor and pathos was a
7385,NOTES.,favorite poem of Abraham Lincoln.
7386,NOTES.,
7387,NOTES.,_The Old Kentucky Home._--The sincere and tender sentiment of this
7388,NOTES.,"song, no less than its popular melody, has made it for many years a"
7389,NOTES.,"favorite. Even better known is Foster's ""Old Folks at Home,"" which is"
7390,NOTES.,said to have had a larger sale than any other American song.
7391,NOTES.,
7392,NOTES.,_Carolina._--The concluding lines of this lyric have an imaginative
7393,NOTES.,vigor rare in American poetry. Four stanzas are omitted.
7394,NOTES.,
7395,NOTES.,_Dirge for a Soldier._--Boker's Dirge was written in memory of General
7396,NOTES.,Philip Kearney.
7397,NOTES.,
7398,NOTES.,"_Battle-hymn of the Republic._--Written in December, 1861, while Mrs."
7399,NOTES.,Howe was on a visit to Washington. Soon after the writer's return to
7400,NOTES.,Boston the lines were accepted for publication in the _Atlantic Monthly_
7401,NOTES.,"by James T. Fields, who suggested the title of the poem. The song did"
7402,NOTES.,"not at first receive much notice, but before the Civil War was over had"
7403,NOTES.,become very popular.
7404,NOTES.,
7405,NOTES.,"_My Maryland._--A poem of great strength and beauty, though of uneven"
7406,NOTES.,merit. It is unfortunately marred by a few rather intemperate
7407,NOTES.,"expressions. The sincerity of feeling is everywhere so evident, however,"
7408,NOTES.,that these must be forgiven. The lines were written by a native of
7409,NOTES.,"Baltimore, Prof. James Randall, and were first published in April, 1861."
7410,NOTES.,The author of the famous song was teaching in a Louisiana college when
7411,NOTES.,he read in a New Orleans paper the news of the attack on the
7412,NOTES.,Massachusetts troops as they passed through Baltimore. This newspaper
7413,NOTES.,account inspired the verses.
7414,NOTES.,
7415,NOTES.,"_In the Hospital._--This poem, which has enjoyed at best a newspaper"
7416,NOTES.,"immortality, deserves to be more widely known. Its simplicity,"
7417,NOTES.,"directness, and truth of feeling are quite beyond praise. According to a"
7418,NOTES.,"story which one dislikes to believe apocryphal, these lines were found"
7419,NOTES.,"under the pillow of a wounded soldier near Port Royal, South Carolina,"
7420,NOTES.,in 1864.
7421,NOTES.,
7422,NOTES.,"_Days._--Regarded from the point of view of artistic form, perhaps"
7423,NOTES.,"nothing of Emerson's is quite so flawless as ""Days,"" a poem which for"
7424,NOTES.,conciseness and polish is worthy to be called classic.
7425,NOTES.,
7426,NOTES.,_A Death-bed._--This is a worthy companion-piece to that other miniature
7427,NOTES.,"classic, Thomas Hood's song, beginning, ""We watched her breathing"
7428,NOTES.,"through the night."""
7429,NOTES.,
7430,NOTES.,"_Telling the Bees._--""A remarkable custom, brought from the Old Country,"
7431,NOTES.,formerly prevailed in the rural districts of New England. On the death
7432,NOTES.,"of a member of the family, the bees were at once informed of the event,"
7433,NOTES.,and their hives dressed in mourning. The ceremonial was supposed to be
7434,NOTES.,necessary to prevent the swarms from leaving their hives and seeking a
7435,NOTES.,"new home."" This poem of Whittier's is almost his highest achievement."
7436,NOTES.,"Lowell said, in writing of the Quaker poet (Appleton's Cyclopedia of"
7437,NOTES.,"American Biography, VI.): ""Many of his poems (such for example as"
7438,NOTES.,"'Telling the Bees'), in which description and sentiment mutually inspire"
7439,NOTES.,"each other, are as fine as any in the language."" I often think, however,"
7440,NOTES.,that Whittier will live longest by his hymns and poems of purely
7441,NOTES.,religious devotion. I know of nothing similar in English that surpasses
7442,NOTES.,"""The Eternal Goodness,"" and perhaps half a dozen other poems."
7443,NOTES.,
7444,NOTES.,_Katie._--About one-third of Timrod's graceful poem which bears this
7445,NOTES.,title. This is one of the few cases where I have ventured to make
7446,NOTES.,omissions.
7447,NOTES.,
7448,NOTES.,"_Thalatta._--Regarding this poem, Thomas Wentworth Higginson says, in"
7449,NOTES.,"""The New World and the New Book:"" ""Who knows but that, when all else of"
7450,NOTES.,"American literature has vanished in forgetfulness, some single little"
7451,NOTES.,"masterpiece like this may remain to show the high-water mark, not merely"
7452,NOTES.,"of a single poet, but of a nation and a generation?"" The author of"
7453,NOTES.,"""Thalatta"" was a Dartmouth graduate, a teacher, and a disciple of"
7454,NOTES.,Emerson.
7455,NOTES.,
7456,NOTES.,_The Fall of the Leaf._--Thoreau's prose is known universally; his verse
7457,NOTES.,has not won as yet the recognition it deserves. It has little lyrical
7458,NOTES.,"quality, but for unconventionality, charming turns of phrase, and the"
7459,NOTES.,"intimate knowledge of Nature it reveals, it is almost alone in American"
7460,NOTES.,poetry.
7461,NOTES.,
7462,NOTES.,"_The Rhodora._--""The Rhodora"" has a conciseness and unity too rare in"
7463,NOTES.,"Emerson's poetry, which, beautiful in details, is strangely uneven. We"
7464,NOTES.,sigh as we think what an unrivalled lyric poet Emerson would have been
7465,NOTES.,had he been sustained at the heights he was capable of reaching. No one
7466,NOTES.,surpasses Emerson at his best; he is almost a great poet.
7467,NOTES.,
7468,NOTES.,_The Chambered Nautilus._--Many think this Holmes's finest poem. It is
7469,NOTES.,"taken from ""The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table,"" 1858."
7470,NOTES.,
7471,NOTES.,"_Thought._--Helen Jackson is, perhaps, the most gifted of American women"
7472,NOTES.,"poets. Emily Dickinson is more imaginative, but her utter scorn of form"
7473,NOTES.,"in composition makes her work, unique as it is, less satisfying. Mrs."
7474,NOTES.,"Jackson was a favorite with Emerson, and he is said to have liked best"
7475,NOTES.,"among her poems this sonnet, ""Thought."""
7476,NOTES.,
7477,NOTES.,"_On a Bust of Dante._--Parsons, one of the best of American poets, is"
7478,NOTES.,"one of the most neglected. Stedman is inclined to think ""On a Bust of"
7479,NOTES.,"Dante"" the finest of American lyrics (see ""The Nature of Poetry,"" 254)."
7480,NOTES.,
7481,NOTES.,_The Port of Skips._--In a recent review of American Literature in the
7482,NOTES.,"London _Athæneum_ occurs this sentence: ""In point of power, workmanship,"
7483,NOTES.,"and feeling, among all poems written by Americans, we are inclined to"
7484,NOTES.,"give first place to the 'Port of Ships,' of Joaquin Miller."""
7485,NOTES.,
7486,NOTES.,_Evening Song._--No poem of Lanier is more free from his characteristic
7487,NOTES.,"faults. One regrets that so much of his work, highly imaginative as it"
7488,NOTES.,"is, is marred by over-elaboration and artificiality."
7489,NOTES.,
7490,NOTES.,"_A Woman's Thought._--The striking reality and directness of this lyric,"
7491,NOTES.,"its immense emotional undercurrent, and its abrupt, almost gasping"
7492,NOTES.,"metre, admirably suited to the impassioned mood of the speaker,--these"
7493,NOTES.,"are a few of the qualities that combine to make ""A Woman's Thought"" one"
7494,NOTES.,of the most remarkable poems in the book.
7495,NOTES.,
7496,NOTES.,_The White Jessamine._--One of the most charming of Father Tabb's
7497,NOTES.,lyrics. The verse of this poet is uneven in merit. He is too prone to
7498,NOTES.,"merely fanciful conceits. But at his best Tabb is imaginative, as, for"
7499,NOTES.,"example, in the lines where he says of Angelo that he--"
7500,NOTES.,
7501,NOTES.,"""From the sterile womb of stone,"
7502,NOTES.,"Raised children unto God."""
7503,NOTES.,
7504,NOTES.,"Always artistic, Tabb's verse usually suggests workmanship; it is more"
7505,NOTES.,"thoughtful than spontaneous. His religious poetry presents, in the main,"
7506,NOTES.,a rather striking similarity to the work of George Herbert.
7507,NOTES.,
7508,NOTES.,_The Battle-field._--Miss Dickinson has much of the witchcraft and
7509,NOTES.,"subtlety of William Blake. Many verses of the shy recluse, whom Mr."
7510,NOTES.,"Higginson so happily has introduced to the world, are not only daring"
7511,NOTES.,"and unconventional, but recklessly defiant of form. But, as her editor"
7512,NOTES.,"has well said, ""When a thought takes one's breath away, a lesson on"
7513,NOTES.,"grammar seems an impertinence."" Emily Dickinson had more than a message,"
7514,NOTES.,"more than the charm of unexpectedness, more than the gift of"
7515,NOTES.,"phrase,--she had (and of how many Americans can this be said?) an"
7516,NOTES.,intense imagination.
7517,NOTES.,
7518,NOTES.,_Fertility._--This selection appears in the collected poems of Maurice
7519,NOTES.,"Thompson (Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1892), under the title of ""A"
7520,NOTES.,"Prelude."""
7521,NOTES.,
7522,NOTES.,_Sesostris._--Of this poem Mr. Stoddard has the high praise that in
7523,NOTES.,"imaginative quality it is unequalled in nineteenth century literature,"
7524,NOTES.,unless by Leigh Hunt's sonnet on the Nile. The same critic does not
7525,NOTES.,"scruple to declare of Mr. Mifflin that he has a ""glorious imagination,"""
7526,NOTES.,and to prophesy for him a distinguished future. Seldom indeed has a
7527,NOTES.,first book of verse won such instant and universal appreciation as Mr.
7528,NOTES.,"Mifflin's volume of sonnets, just issued as the ""American Treasury"" goes"
7529,NOTES.,to press.
