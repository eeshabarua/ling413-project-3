303,MEMOIR,It is the felicity of these pages that they cannot be dull. It is
304,MEMOIR,"their merit, peculiar in such a memoir, that they cannot be sad. It"
305,MEMOIR,is their novelty that they can be restricted in appeal only by the
306,MEMOIR,varieties of the human species. It is their good fortune that they can
307,MEMOIR,be extraordinarily frank. It is their virtue that they cannot fail to
308,MEMOIR,do unmeasurable good. And it is their luck to abide many days.

310,MEMOIR,"With their subject how could it be otherwise? They make not a wreath,"
311,MEMOIR,"but a chronicle, and in their assembled facts tell a bright chapter"
312,MEMOIR,in the history of our time. If there is one word which more than any
313,MEMOIR,other should be linked with the name of this gallant figure now claimed
314,MEMOIR,"(and rightly) by so many elements of the nation, that word certainly"
315,MEMOIR,"is “American.” A character and a career so racy, typical of all that"
316,MEMOIR,"everybody likes to believe that at our best we are, can hardly be"

321,I,
322,I,"Joyce Kilmer was reported in the papers as having said, just before"
323,I,"he sailed for France, that he was “half Irish,” and that was why he"
324,I,belonged with the boys of the Sixty-ninth. His birth was not exactly
325,I,"eloquent of this fact. Though, indeed, he was, as will appear, a much"
326,I,"more ardent Irishman than many an Irishman born--that is, in the sense"
327,I,"of keenly savouring those things which are fine in the Irish character,"
328,I,and with characteristic gusto feeling within himself an affinity with
329,I,"them. Later, in a letter from France to his wife, he was more explicit"
330,I,on this point:
331,I,
332,I,As to the matter of my own blood (you mentioned this in a
333,I,previous letter) I did indeed tell a good friend of mine who
334,I,edits the book-review page of a Chicago paper that I was “half
335,I,Irish.” But I have never been a mathematician. The point I
336,I,wished to make was that a large percentage--which I have a
337,I,perfect right to call half--of my ancestry was Irish. For proof
338,I,"of this, you have only to refer to the volumes containing the"
339,I,histories of my mother’s and my father’s families. Of course I
340,I,"am American, but one cannot be pure American in blood unless"
341,I,one is an Indian. And I have the good fortune to be able to
342,I,"claim, largely because of the wise matrimonial selections of my"
343,I,"progenitors on both sides, Irish blood. And don’t let anyone"
344,I,publish a statement contrary to this.
345,I,
346,I,"He also, in a letter from France, quoted with much relish the remark"
347,I,of Father Francis P. Duffy that he was “half German and half human.”
348,I,English and Scotch strains made up another half or three quarters. The
349,I,"English goes straight back to one Thomas Kilburne, church warden at"
350,I,"Wooddilton, near Newmarket, in Cambridgeshire, who came to Connecticut"
351,I,"in 1638. The “e” was lost apparently in Massachusetts, and the word"
352,I,"became, as in his mother’s maiden name, Kilburn."
353,I,
354,I,"Soldier blood, too, flowed in his veins--though it is likely that this"
355,I,"fact for the first time occurred to him, if at all, when his nature"
356,I,"rose white-hot to arms. He was, so to say, a Colonial Dame on both"
357,I,"sides, as members of both his father’s and his mother’s family fought"
358,I,in the American Revolution; and members of his father’s family in the
359,I,French and Indian wars.
360,I,
361,I,"Alfred Joyce Kilmer (as he was christened) was born at New Brunswick,"
362,I,"New Jersey, December 6, 1886, son of Annie Kilburn and Frederick"
363,I,"Kilmer. Though he seems always to have been, in familiar address and"
364,I,"allusion, called Joyce, the Alfred did not disappear from his address"
365,I,"and signature until he began, as more or less of a professional"
366,I,"writer, to publish his work, when it went the way of the Newton in Mr."
367,I,"Tarkington’s name, and the Enoch in Mr. Bennett’s. Then “Joyce Kilmer”"
368,I,acquired a fine humorous disdain for what he regarded as the florid
369,I,"note in literary signatures of three words (or, worse still to his"
370,I,"mind, the A. Joyce kind of thing); and he enjoyed handing down, with"
371,I,"much relish of the final and judicial character of his utterance, the"
372,I,"opinion that the proper sort of a trademark, so to say, for success"
373,I,"in letters was something short, pointed, easy to say and to remember,"
374,I,"such as Rudyard Kipling, Mark Twain, O. Henry, Joseph Conrad, and so on"
375,I,"through illustrations carried, at length, to intentionally infuriating"
376,I,numbers.
377,I,
378,I,"As a small boy, Kilmer is described by those who knew him then as the"
379,I,"“funniest” small boy they ever saw, by which is meant, apparently, that"
380,I,"he was an odd spectacle. And this, of course, is so altogether in line"
381,I,with literary tradition that it would have been odd if he had not been
382,I,"an oddity in the way of a spectacle. He wore queer clothes, it seems,"
383,I,"ordinary stockings with bicycle breeches, and that sort of thing. He"
384,I,"didn’t altogether fit in somehow, couldn’t find himself, was somewhat"
385,I,of an outsider among the juvenile clans; he was required to fight other
386,I,boys a good deal; he evidenced a pronounced inability to comprehend
387,I,anything at all of arithmetic; and somewhere between eight and twelve
388,I,"(so the report goes) he contracted a violent passion for a lady, of"
389,I,"about thirty-five, who was his teacher at school; a passion which"
390,I,"endured for a considerable time, and became a hilarious legend among"
391,I,the youth about him of jocose humour.
392,I,
393,I,"It is told that at “Prep” school, when this goal seemed rather unlikely"
394,I,"of his attainment, he made up his mind to stand at the head of his"
395,I,class; and with something like the later Kilmerian exercise of will he
396,I,accomplished his purpose.
397,I,
398,I,"Kilmer was graduated from Rutgers College in 1904, and received his"
399,I,"A. B. from Columbia in 1906. His University life seems to have been,"
400,I,"in outward effect, fairly normal. There is no ready evidence that he"
401,I,"“shone” particularly, and none that he failed to “shine.” He was not"
402,I,"deported by the authorities, and he was not unanimously hailed the idol"
403,I,of his classmates. He became a member of Delta Upsilon fraternity: and
404,I,"he was, of course, active in college journalism. Then as always he"
405,I,"appears to have been zestful in living well, to have counted sufficient"
406,I,"to the day the excellence thereof, and to have been too warm with"
407,I,life to be calculating in expenditures. He retained in the years that
408,I,followed--and it seems to have been the college memory he retained most
409,I,distinctly--a humorous recollection of his consuming his allowance on
410,I,"an abundance of rich viands during the first few days of each month,"
411,I,and being reduced to the necessity of living precariously on a meagre
412,I,ration of crackers and sandwiches thereafter--until next income day.
413,I,
414,I,"Characteristic of the vehement manner in which he went after life, as"
415,I,"a Sophomore Kilmer became engaged to Miss Aline Murray, of New Jersey,"
416,I,"a step-daughter of Henry Mills Alden, editor of _Harper’s Magazine_."
417,I,Upon leaving Columbia he took up the business of making a living in the
418,I,"way of an elder American intellectual tradition, by teaching school in"
419,I,a (more or less) rural community. He returned to New Jersey and began
420,I,his career as instructor of Latin at Morristown High School. So slight
421,I,"a lad he was, even several years after this time, that it is difficult"
422,I,to picture him in the disciplinary adventures of the classic figure
423,I,of this calling. His problems at Morristown doubtless were dissimilar
424,I,"to those of his early, Hoosier, prototype. He married and became a"
425,I,"householder. His son, Kenton, was born. In religion he had been bred"
426,I,"an Episcopalian, and during this period in New Jersey (it is told) he"
427,I,acted as a lay reader in this church.
428,I,
429,I,"He soon concluded, apparently, that pedagogy was, so to say, no life"
430,I,for a boy. At the conclusion of a year’s teaching he tore up the roots
431,I,"he had planted, and, together with the young lady he had married, and"
432,I,"the son born to them, and with a few youthful poems in his pocket, he"
433,I,"advanced upon the metropolis, even in the classic way, on the ancient"
434,I,quest of conscious talent.
435,I,
436,I,The rapidity and brilliance of Joyce Kilmer’s success has altogether
437,I,obscured his very democratic beginnings. As his initial occupation
438,I,"in New York, he obtained, by a lucky chance, employment as editor"
439,I,"of a journal for horsemen, though of horses he had no particular"
440,I,"knowledge--to be exact, no such knowledge whatever. Here finding little"
441,I,"to do, and discovering one day in a desk drawer a bulky manuscript, he"
442,I,"decided--as he was editor--to edit it. This, apparently, he did with"
443,I,youthful energy. The little job he mentioned with some satisfaction
444,I,"to his employer, a fine portly sportsman with a crimson face and an"
445,I,irascible temper. The young editor explained that the manuscript
446,I,"evidently had been written by a man familiar with horses, but one"
447,I,"apparently innocent of the art of literary composition. “Young man,”"
448,I,"bellowed his employer, “I would have you understand I have been through"
449,I,"the best veterinary college in the world, and I have been a veterinary"
450,I,"myself for over forty years.” His wife, he added, was his amanuensis,"
451,I,and he guessed she knew something about writing. The editorship came to
452,I,an abrupt termination.
453,I,
454,I,"Then followed a brief sojourn, at a salary of (I think) eight dollars"
455,I,"a week, as retail salesman in the book store of Charles Scribner’s"
456,I,"Sons, a dignity which the young littérateur wore with humorous dignity"
457,I,for exactly two weeks. A distinct mental impression of him of this
458,I,"time presents him as decidedly like an Eton boy in general effect, and"
459,I,it seems that a large white collar and a small-size high hat should
460,I,have gone with him to make the picture quite right. One who met him
461,I,"then felt at once a gracious, slightly courtly, young presence. He"
462,I,"gave forth an aroma of excellent, gentlemanly manners. He frequently"
463,I,"pronounced, as an indication that he had not heard you clearly, the"
464,I,"word “Pardon?”--with a slight forward inclination of his head, which,"
465,I,"altogether, was adorable. His smile, never far away, when it came was"
466,I,"winning, charming. It broke like spring sunshine, it was so fresh and"
467,I,"warm and clear. And there was noticeable then in his eyes a light,"
468,I,a quiet glow which marked him as a spirit not to be forgotten. So
469,I,tenderly boyish was he in effect that his confreres among the book
470,I,clerks accepted with difficulty the story that he was married. When it
471,I,was told that he had a son they gasped their incredulity. And when one
472,I,day this extraordinary elfin sprite remarked that at the time of his
473,I,honeymoon he had had a beard they felt (I remember) that the world was
474,I,without power to astonish them further.
475,I,
476,I,"As a retail salesman, however, this exceedingly interesting young"
477,I,man did not make a high mark. One’s general impression of him “on
478,I,"the floor” is a picture of a happy student, standing, entranced,"
479,I,frequently with his back to the door (which theoretically he should
480,I,"have been watching for incoming customers), day after day engrossed"
481,I,in perusing a rare edition of “Madame Bovary.” One sensational feat
482,I,"of business he did as a clerk perform. Misreading, in his newness"
483,I,"to these hieroglyphics, the cypher in which in stores the prices of"
484,I,"books are marked on the fly leaves of the volumes, he sold to a lady a"
485,I,hundred-and-fifty-dollar book for a dollar and a half. This transaction
486,I,"being what is termed a “charge sale,” not a “cash sale,” and amid some"
487,I,"excitement the matter being immediately rectified, disaster for the"
488,I,amateur salesman was averted.
489,I,
490,I,"At Scribner’s a close friendship was, almost at once, formed between"
491,I,the youthful poet and another then unpublished writer acting at that
492,I,time in the same capacity of clerk--a friendship which was never
493,I,"diminished by the numerous shiftings of Kilmer’s fields of activity,"
494,I,"the multitudinous, diverse and ardent interests which he acquired"
495,I,"in an ever-mounting measure, and the steady addition of numberless"
496,I,friends of all classes who eagerly yielded him their devotion. It
497,I,was rather a friendship which was continually cemented by increasing
498,I,and closer bonds. It was a part of Kilmer’s spirit to make his first
499,I,friend in his literary life a sharer as far as was possible in each
500,I,"new success of his own. One among many, innumerable, instances of"
501,I,"this was his contriving, by his influence with the editor (at that"
502,I,"time another intimate, Louis H. Wetmore), to work his friend into a"
503,I,position somewhat rivaling his own at the period (1912–1913) when he
504,I,was the bright and shining star reviewer for the _New York Times Review
505,I,of Books_. The regular Tuesday lunching together of these two friends
506,I,"when their offices were widely separated became, at least in their own"
507,I,"fancy, an American literary institution. The two were united in all"
508,I,the symbols of affection between men. And at seasons of rejoicing and
509,I,adversity the Kilmer house was to his friend as his own. It is to this
510,I,one who among all of Joyce Kilmer’s friends owes him the greatest debt
511,I,"of friendship has come the supreme trust of writing, within the power"
512,I,"of his many and conscious limitations, this Memoir, and editing these"
513,I,volumes.
514,I,
515,I,Dropping the very small bird which he held in his hand in the way of
516,I,"a secure salary, the spectacular bookseller, somewhat to twist the"
517,I,"figure, plunged again into uncharted seas, and became a lexicographer,"
518,I,as an editorial assistant in the work of preparing a new edition of
519,I,the Standard Dictionary. He blithely began his Johnsonian labours by
520,I,"defining ordinary words assigned to him, at a pay of five cents for"
521,I,each word defined. This is a very different thing indeed from receiving
522,I,a rate of five cents a word for writing. It is a task at which you
523,I,"can obtain an average of perhaps ten or twelve dollars a week, though"
524,I,"some weeks “stickers” will hold you back. It soon became apparent,"
525,I,"evidently, that it was advisable to put this very capable pieceworker"
526,I,"on a salary; and he was rapidly promoted, with corresponding increases"
527,I,in remuneration (reaching an amount of something like four times his
528,I,"initial earnings), to more advanced phases of the work: research into"
529,I,dates of birth (involving correspondence with living celebrities);
530,I,"research into the inception of inventions (as, for example, the"
531,I,introduction of the barrier into horse racing); together with the
532,I,"defining of words of contemporary origin, in, for instance, the"
533,I,"nomenclature of aviation. In this last mentioned department, it was"
534,I,"his office to call upon authorities, such as the Wright brothers, and"
535,I,upon presentation of his credentials to receive precise information. He
536,I,"interviewed famous tobacco importers, and coffee merchants; compiled in"
537,I,the New York Public Library material about fans; unearthed for use as
538,I,an illustration a picture of a strange bird; or was assigned to collect
539,I,for this purpose designs of ancient mouldings.
540,I,
541,I,"If lexicography was Kilmer’s venerable occupation, by political faith"
542,I,"he was at the time, this very young, young man, a socialist. He"
543,I,subscribed for and frequently contributed to the _Call_ newspaper.
544,I,And the height of his effervescence was in addressing meetings of the
545,I,"proletariat. He was, it must be said, a burning “young radical.” He"
546,I,"frequented, to some extent, a club of that name. And with a joyous"
547,I,consciousness of being in the character of his surroundings he ate
548,I,meals at the Rand School of Social Science. He rapidly acquired a
549,I,"wonderful string of queer acquaintances, in whose idiosyncrasies he"
550,I,"took immense delight. Some, not of the persuasion, fancied that as"
551,I,an adherent of the socialist party he was merely enamoured of an
552,I,"intellectual idea. At any rate, whenever in conversation he spoke"
553,I,"of socialism, as he frequently did, his graceful, amiable young"
554,I,features assumed a very firm and earnest aspect. Exactly the point
555,I,"of transition, if there was any decided point, I cannot recall, but"
556,I,from the proletariat he passed to the literati. A “man of letters”
557,I,became a great word with him. And he looked rather proudly about as
558,I,"he said it, as a Scot might speak of the doughty deeds of the Scotch."
559,I,"He was wont to refer, too, to the “intellectual aristocracy.” His"
560,I,"luncheon engagements were now mostly with this order of humanity, and"
561,I,his anecdotes featured such figures as Richard Le Gallienne and Bliss
562,I,Carman--men whose personalities delighted his heart beyond measure.
563,I,
564,I,"How absurdly juvenile he looked. But you would have noted, as you"
565,I,"observed him, that he had a very fine head, something like that of"
566,I,"Arthur Symons (without the moustache), I thought; or, according to"
567,I,Mr. Le Gallienne’s sympathetic picture in _The Bookman_: “Though the
568,I,"resemblance was perhaps only a spiritual expression, his then thin,"
569,I,"austere young face, with those strangely strong and gentle eyes (eyes"
570,I,"that seemed to have an independent, dominating existence), reminded me"
571,I,"of Lionel Johnson, for whom he had already a great admiration, and"
572,I,"whose religion he was afterwards to embrace.” Or, again, he seemed as"
573,I,if he might be a comely youth out of ancient Greece. I think that what
574,I,I mean is that he was so unlike all other young men anyone had ever
575,I,"seen walking about, so much brighter and purer, or some indescribable"
576,I,"thing, that he did not seem altogether real. A feeling which I think"
577,I,"was shared by many, and which I have never quite been able to make"
578,I,"articulate, Mr. Le Gallienne has most happily expressed with his own"
579,I,"easy charm; that is the “hint of destiny” in this “very concentrated,"
580,I,"intense young presence--masculine intense, not feminine:”"
581,I,
582,I,"We have all met young people who give us that--beautiful,"
583,I,"brilliant, lovely natured, so superabundant in all their"
584,I,qualities (and particularly perhaps in some quality of
585,I,"emanating light)--as to make them suggest the supernatural, and"
586,I,"touched, too, with the finger of a moonlight that has written"
587,I,“fated” upon their brows. Probably our feeling is nothing more
588,I,mysterious than our realisation that temperaments so vital and
589,I,intense must inevitably tempt richer and swifter fates than
590,I,those less wild winged.
591,I,
592,I,"Above all, this young gentleman was the portrait of a poet, even (in"
593,I,those days) of the type of literary sophistication which is (or was)
594,I,called decadent! There was about him a perceptible aroma of literary
595,I,self-consciousness. He had begun to contribute to magazines and
596,I,"newspapers the verses which he soon gathered into a first volume, “A"
597,I,"Summer of Love” (an “author’s book,” as the trade term has it), verses"
598,I,"patently derivative in character (as whose early verses are not?),"
599,I,showing the influences of various masters.
600,I,
601,I,"He had already become a bit of a celebrity, arriving at twenty-five"
602,I,in _Who’s Who_. In conversation he spoke with striking fluency and
603,I,"precision, and a rather amusing effect of authority; all of which,"
604,I,"together with a ready command, rather incongruous for his years, of"
605,I,"very apt words little employed in speech, gave a general impression, I"
606,I,"fancy, of something of an infant prodigy. He wrote in a letter of this"
607,I,time of the poems of Coventry Patmore:
608,I,
609,I,I have come to regard them with intense admiration. Have you
610,I,read them? Patmore seems to me to be a greater poet than
611,I,"Francis Thompson. (Kilmer, had by the way, just given a lecture"
612,I,at Columbia University on Francis Thompson.) He has not the
613,I,"rich vocabulary, the decorative erudition, the Shelleyan"
614,I,"enthusiasm, which distinguish the “Sister Songs” and the “Hound"
615,I,"of Heaven,” but he has a classical simplicity, a restraint and"
616,I,sincerity which make his poems satisfying. Some of his shorter
617,I,"poems, such as “Alexander and Lycon” and “The Toys,” approach"
618,I,"Landor in their Greek economy. Of course, the “Angel in the"
619,I,"House,” and many other of his poems, are marred by Tennysonian"
620,I,influences. But the “Unknown Eros” is a work of stupendous
621,I,beauty. It is certainly supreme among modern religious poems.
622,I,That part of it devoted to Eros and Psyche is remarkably
623,I,"daring and remarkably fine. Psyche symbolizes the soul, and"
624,I,Eros the love of God. Their amour is described with realistic
625,I,"minuteness, even with humorous flippancy, and yet the whole"
626,I,poem is alive with religious feeling.
627,I,
628,I,"The finding of Patmore, by the way, was what might be called a"
629,I,finger-post in Kilmer’s life. The fortunate introduction was performed
630,I,"by, it is my impression, Kilmer’s friend Thomas Walsh."
631,I,
632,I,If in cold print to-day there is a slightly preposterous didactic
633,I,"quality in these remarks of this youthful character, it should be"
634,I,instantly noted as a tribute to the charm that was his that in the
635,I,"presence of so much handsomeness and grace, combined with so much"
636,I,"flexibility of mind and agile humour, even this was an engaging thing."
637,I,
638,I,There was to Kilmer nothing whatever dry-as-dust about the erudite
639,I,business of lexicography; instead his impressionable nature found among
640,I,"his co-workers a rich, a colourful, an exciting school of humanity. He"
641,I,glowed continually with affectionate amusement at the motley band of
642,I,"literary adventurers, intellectual soldiers of fortune, who apparently"
643,I,"were his colleagues. One, the most motley perhaps of all (the long"
644,I,cherished dream of whose ancient bachelor life it was one day to write
645,I,"a popular song), touched, for the first time, I think, the deepest"
646,I,spring of his song--his profound and wide-ranging humanity.
647,I,
648,I,Some people ask: “What cruel chance
649,I,Made Martin’s life so sad a story?”
650,I,"Martin? Why, he exhaled romance,"
651,I,And wore an overcoat of glory.
652,I,
653,I,
654,II,II
655,II,
656,II,"And then, lo! the aesthete became a churchman. After a couple of"
657,II,"years or so of lexicographic employment, work on the dictionary was"
658,II,"completed, and Kilmer entered what, with immense gusto, he described as"
659,II,“religious journalism.” He became literary editor of _The Churchman_.
660,II,
661,II,He had completed a very thorough course in uptown New York apartment
662,II,"house life (living, I think, in rapid succession in some half dozen"
663,II,specimens of “the great stone box cruelly displayed severe against the
664,II,pleasant arc of sky”); and now removing to the suburban village of
665,II,"Mahwah, New Jersey, in the Ramapo foothills, he entered upon his career"
666,II,"as one of the world’s most accomplished commuters. He used to say, with"
667,II,"a spacious gesture of the arm and a haughty inflation of the chest,"
668,II,"that it was no life at all, no life at all, for a man not to swing"
669,II,around an orbit of at least sixty miles a day between his office and
670,II,"his home. His home, even so!"
671,II,
672,II,I never have seen a vagabond who really liked to roam
673,II,All up and down the streets of the world and not to have a home.
674,II,
675,II,What more exhilarating experience than the owning of a home! And one
676,II,paid one’s installments on the building loan with the fine pride of a
677,II,"man exercising a noble prerogative. Yes, he often walked to Suffern"
678,II,"along the Erie track, and meditated on “what a house should do, a house"
679,II,"that has sheltered life,”"
680,II,
681,II,"That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,"
682,II,A house that has echoed a baby’s laugh and held up his stumbling feet.
683,II,
684,II,"As became a churchman, he began to hold forth to his companion on the"
685,II,train to and from the city on the fascinations of the Anglican poets.
686,II,Either his enthusiasm for the subject resulted in a series of articles
687,II,"on the theme, or an assignment for such a series of articles resulted"
688,II,"in his enthusiasm, I don’t know which. The significant point is that it"
689,II,was just as like to have been either way about. “Passon Hawker”--Robert
690,II,"Stephen Hawker--Vicar of Morwenstow, a coast life-guard in a"
691,II,cassock--who can recite off hand the deeds of his piety and his valour?
692,II,"Well, on the Erie smoker he became one of the most romantic figures of"
693,II,"story. Robert Herrick, in a manner of speaking, went home many a night"
694,II,"on the Twelve-Forty-Five (Robert Herrick, that is, with his “Unbaptized"
695,II,"Rhimes” left out), and Bishop Coxe returned on the Seven-Fifty-Six in"
696,II,the morning.
697,II,
698,II,Kilmer had already done a few book reviews for _The Nation_ and for the
699,II,_New York Times_; but at _The Churchman_ he acquired such a proficiency
700,II,"at this exercise that he was able, jocularly, to regard Arnold Bennett,"
701,II,"as a literary journalist, as a “mere amateur.” The real reward of"
702,II,"“religious journalism,” however, it soon developed, was the opportunity"
703,II,"of writing a feature which the secular might call an editorial, but"
704,II,"the proper name of which this editor pronounced, in the tone and with"
705,II,"the manner of one who was consciously engaged in something grand,"
706,II,"gloomy and peculiar, as a “meditation.”"
707,II,
708,II,"The real meditations of Joyce Kilmer, however, were not “meditations”"
709,II,"so called, and partook in no wise of the nature of editorials. He had"
710,II,"been, in the main, a graceful troubadour who thrummed pleasant things"
711,II,"to his lady-love, and had a bright eye to his singing robes. He had"
712,II,"thought it rather fine, too, that refrain in imitation of Richepin:"
713,II,
714,II,"May booze be plenty, bulls be few,"
715,II,The poet is the beggars’ king.
716,II,
717,II,"He had even been much taken, artistically, with the thought of absinthe:"
718,II,
719,II,"O little green god in your crystal shrine,"
720,II,Your heavenly dream-shower shed!
721,II,
722,II,"It was when his business took him near to God, when his exploring"
723,II,"spirit, upon a peak in Darien, beheld that:"
724,II,
725,II,"Poems are made by fools like me,"
726,II,"But only God can make a tree,"
727,II,
728,II,"that he began to be a poet. “Trees,” which more than all the rest he"
729,II,"had written put together made his reputation, appeared in _Poetry. A"
730,II,"Magazine of Verse_ in August, 1913."
731,II,
732,II,"At about this period it was that he was altogether born again. Then,"
733,II,doubtless in castigatory reaction against his own aesthetic and
734,II,"“decadent” wild oats, entered into his fibre that sovereign disdain for"
735,II,the intellectual flub-dub which later gave such a delightful note of
736,II,“horse-sense” to all his humorous thought--the Johnsonian sting (“and
737,II,don’t you think you were an ass?”) which found its earliest biting
738,II,expression in the verses “To a Young Poet Who Killed Himself.”
739,II,
740,II,"“I’ve been leading a rather active life, for several days,” was with"
741,II,"a gay salute of the hand, a frequent Kilmerian remark. In 1912 the"
742,II,direction of the _New York Times Review of Books_ fell into the hands
743,II,"of a high-spirited young man, a Max-Beerbohmian character, with a"
744,II,"decided taste for gaiety in reviews, Mr. Wetmore, who conducted that"
745,II,organ through what is known in New York journalistic tradition as its
746,II,“meteoric period.” Mr. Wetmore’s wit perceived in Kilmer his happiest
747,II,rocket. Not only given his head but egged on by his editor to strive
748,II,"for sublime heights of fantasy, this fairly unknown contributor shot"
749,II,"in a series of reviews which for readability was, the applause now"
750,II,"indicated, an altogether new thing in the book pages of an American"
751,II,"newspaper. “This is a bad book, a very bad book, indeed,” so ran the"
752,II,style. “It is bad because it makes this reviewer feel old and fat
753,II,"and bald.” If, together with their humorous assumption of a jovial"
754,II,"cocksureness of manner, the literary judgments expressed were, of"
755,II,"necessity, snap-shot judgments, there was nothing snap-shot nor assumed"
756,II,about a certain quality in them which in general effect was the most
757,II,"striking of all, namely, the reflection in a very positive way of a"
758,II,"radiantly clean and wholesome young nature, abounding in mental and"
759,II,spiritual health.
760,II,
761,II,"As one of the general prime movers in, and for a number of years"
762,II,"Corresponding Secretary of The Poetry Society of America, Kilmer"
763,II,engaged on the side in activities which for many another would have
764,II,"been in themselves almost a whole job. A fervent Dickensonian, he was"
765,II,for a long period president and (one felt) the animating principle
766,II,of the American Dickens Fellowship. He accumulated offices to such
767,II,an extent that I am doubtful if anyone but himself knew exactly how
768,II,"many employments he had altogether, or at any one moment. He conducted"
769,II,the Poetry department of _The Literary Digest_ for something like
770,II,"nine years, an obligation which he continued to fulfill even from"
771,II,"Camp Mills, Long Island, to the time when he sailed for France. For a"
772,II,"time he conducted a similar department in _Current Literature_, and"
773,II,"also did a quarterly article on poetry for, I think, the _Review of"
774,II,Reviews_. Among his earlier essays in the lecture field was a paper on
775,II,"“The Drama as an Instrument of Sex Education,” read before a regular"
776,II,meeting of the Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis held at the
777,II,"New York Academy of Medicine, in December, 1913. The society with the"
778,II,"playful name, I recollect, got seriously interested in the matter of"
779,II,sex education as then expounded. Their views on the drama in this
780,II,connection were enlarged by acquisition of the idea that though “‘The
781,II,"Great Love’ is, in my opinion, one of the most skilfully constructed"
782,II,"plays presented on the New York stage for many a year, I am quite"
783,II,"serious in saying that as a factor in sex education, it is a thousand"
784,II,times inferior to ‘Bertha the Beautiful Cloak Model.’”
785,II,
786,II,"As Kilmer was always decidedly what is termed a ready writer, what I"
787,II,should attempt to describe as a natural writer (a startling exception
788,II,"to the rule that easy writing makes hard reading), so he appeared to"
789,II,"have the gift of speaking readily in public. On frequent occasions,"
790,II,"at any rate in his early talks, he neglected altogether to prepare"
791,II,"any outline beforehand, and even sometimes to choose a subject. Every"
792,II,"now and then, I have known him repeatedly to say to his companion at"
793,II,"dinner, without, however, any trace at all of nervousness: “Now, look"
794,II,here: Put your mind on this. Stop all that gossip. Tell me what I’m to
795,II,talk about. I have to begin” (looking at his watch) “in twenty-five
796,II,minutes.”
797,II,
798,II,"He was particularly active in the affairs of the Authors’ Club, and was"
799,II,"a member of the Vagabonds, the Columbia University Club and the Alianza"
800,II,"Puertorriguena. In 1913 he ceased, officially, to be a churchman."
801,II,"For a brief period he contemplated the prospect of a professorship,"
802,II,"lecturing on English Literature at the University of the South,"
803,II,"Sewanee, Tennessee. Then, to his great delight, he became a newspaper"
804,II,"man--as he continually put it, with much relish in the part, “a hard"
805,II,newspaper man.” He became a special writer for the _New York Times
806,II,Sunday Magazine_. I am sure he saw himself in fancy as one of those
807,II,weather-beaten characters bred in the old-time newspaper school of
808,II,"booze, profanity and hard knocks, his only text-book the police-court"
809,II,blotter and the moulder of his youth a particularly brutal night
810,II,"city-editor. He maintained, with humorous arrogance against opposing"
811,II,"argument, the thesis that every great writer had got his “training”"
812,II,"as a newspaper man. He delighted to point, as illustrations of this,"
813,II,"to Dickens, to Thackeray, and to a lot more, who, in any strict sense"
814,II,"of the word, were not “newspaper men” at all. Hard pressed, he even"
815,II,stood ready to make some such hilariously sweeping assertion as that
816,II,"George Eliot, Shakespeare, Tennyson and Robert Browning were, properly"
817,II,"perceived, “newspaper men.”"
818,II,
819,II,"At any rate, this hard newspaper man had to begin with a comical"
820,II,equipment for his task: he would never learn to typewrite and he knew
821,II,"nothing of shorthand. Or rather, he was remarkably well equipped, as"
822,II,one of the outstanding traits of his character was the fearless zest
823,II,"with which, so to say, he took the hurdles of life, and a peculiar"
824,II,faculty in triumphing over such obstacles as his own limitations. He
825,II,rapidly invented a curious system of abbreviations and marks to remind
826,II,"him of points, which served him as an interviewer as effectively as any"
827,II,knowledge of stenography could have done. He energetically entered upon
828,II,his occupation as a feature writer with the customary themes of the
829,II,"“Sunday story.” He interviewed, figuratively speaking, the man who had"
830,II,"discovered the missing link, and he got from the latest inventor of"
831,II,perpetual motion all the arresting details of his machine. And a lively
832,II,part of the early Sunday morning ritual at his home was the advance
833,II,calculating with a tape measure of the week’s income from space writing.
834,II,
835,II,It was later that he created his own highly successful type of literary
836,II,"interview. An intelligent perception of the business, a perception"
837,II,"which is not general, perhaps is required fully to appreciate the"
838,II,fact that in this department of newspaper work he was an exceedingly
839,II,skillful journalist. The secret of his really brilliant success in this
840,II,field lay in large part in his instinct for luring the distinguished
841,II,"subject of his interview into provocative statements, enabling him to"
842,II,employ such heads as: “Is O. Henry a Pernicious Literary Influence?”
843,II,"“Godlessness Mars Most Contemporary Poetry,” “Americans Lack Loyalty To"
844,II,"Their Writers,” “Shackled Magazine Editors Harm Literature,” “Declares"
845,II,Our Rich Authors Make Cheap Literature” and “Says American Literature
846,II,Is Going To the Dogs.”
847,II,
848,II,"At the time of the death of James Whitcomb Riley, Kilmer hurried to"
849,II,the Catskills for his interview with Bliss Carman. On his way back
850,II,"to the city, by way of his home at Mahwah, he dashed with his usual"
851,II,"impetuosity in front of the moving train he was seeking to board, was"
852,II,"knocked down and hurled or dragged a considerable distance, and taken"
853,II,"to the Good Samaritan Hospital at Suffern, New York, with three ribs"
854,II,"fractured and other injuries; where, wiring immediately to New York"
855,II,"for his secretary, he dictated an interview as engaging and as full of"
856,II,journalistic craft as any he ever wrote. He seemed much more intent
857,II,"on his Sunday story, it is reported by H. Christopher Watts, who was"
858,II,"acting as his secretary at that time, than on his predicament."
859,II,
860,II,"I did not see Kilmer at this time myself, but I have an idea that,"
861,II,"when he had relieved his mind of the anxiety concerning his article,"
862,II,he entered into the spirit of his experience with much relish. It
863,II,"isn’t every day that one gets hit by a train, nor everybody that has"
864,II,"three ribs broken. Exhilarating kind of thing, when you see it that"
865,II,way! I remember one time when I was practically in hospital myself he
866,II,went to a good deal of trouble to come to see me. He seemed to admire
867,II,"my predicament very much, and, beaming upon me, remarked in high good"
868,II,humour that it must be an entertaining thing to be so completely at the
869,II,mercy of circumstances over which you had no control. When shall we
870,II,look upon his like again!
871,II,
872,II,
873,III,III
874,III,
875,III,I really doubt very much whether anybody ever enjoyed food more than
876,III,"Kilmer. The slender youth had become a decidedly stocky young man,"
877,III,who ate mammoth meals with prodigious satisfaction. He delighted upon
878,III,"sitting down to breakfast to maintain, with almost savage earnestness"
879,III,"(such was the amusing effect), that the most fitting dish for that meal"
880,III,"was steak. As a matter of fact, however, his habit was to miss his"
881,III,"breakfast altogether through haste to catch his train, except for a cup"
882,III,"of coffee and a piece of buttered toast which, when he missed the ’bus,"
883,III,"he ate, a mouthful every dozen or so leaps, on his way down the hill"
884,III,"(almost a mountain) to the station. Sundays, however, with the whole"
885,III,"day at home, he apparently regarded among other things as a sort of"
886,III,barbecue. Looking over the morning table it was his custom to inquire
887,III,"with the air of a man making a fairly satisfactory beginning, what was"
888,III,scheduled for dinner.
889,III,
890,III,"Kilmer never ate any lunch, as the ordinary world understands the"
891,III,word--about the first hour of the afternoon he went (when his means
892,III,had become such that he could afford it) to a sort of Thanksgiving or
893,III,Christmas dinner every day. How proceeding directly to his office he
894,III,"did any work afterward, was always considerable of a mystery to me. And"
895,III,lunching alone he doubtless regarded as a misanthropic perversion. His
896,III,luncheons and his frequent dinners in town alone represented what many
897,III,"would regard as a rather arduous social life, which however arduous,"
898,III,"however, never failed to include the weekly luncheon with his mother,"
899,III,"Mrs. Kilburn-Kilmer. As an epilogue, so to say, to his meal it was his"
900,III,"wont to have, speaking his order slowly so as to suck the full flavour"
901,III,"of the idea, “a large black cigar.”"
902,III,
903,III,One time being in the city with his family for a period after the birth
904,III,"of one of his children, he gave a series of Sunday morning breakfasts"
905,III,at a fashionable restaurant (it was a pleasant crotchet with him
906,III,"that he was “a fashionable young man”), entertainments which were"
907,III,"distinguished by, first, the fact the guests so abundantly represented"
908,III,"the world of journalism that they filled a good portion of the room,"
909,III,"and, secondly, by the circumstance of their lingering at the board"
910,III,until mid-day diners began to arrive.
911,III,
912,III,"How a poet could _not_ be a glorious eater, it was one of Kilmer’s"
913,III,"whims to say, he could not see; for the poet was happier than other"
914,III,"men by reason of his acuter senses, and as his eyes delighted in the"
915,III,"beauty of the world, so should his palate thrill with pleasure in the"
916,III,taste of the earth’s bounteous yield for the sustenance of men. The
917,III,"romance, too, of the things we eat he felt lustily."
918,III,
919,III,"Rich spices from the Orient,"
920,III,And fruit that knew Italian skies.
921,III,
922,III,"He had another, and a decidedly quaint, notion of food. He firmly"
923,III,believed that hearty eating was an adequate physical compensation for
924,III,loss of sleep. He was fond of declaring his faith in this fantastic
925,III,idea by means of a story of some “ancient receptive child” (friend of
926,III,his) who managed to bring up a family of seven (or so) children by
927,III,ill-paid hack-work occupying most of the day and night--a noble success
928,III,due entirely to noble meals.

932,III,This man has home and child and wife
933,III,And battle set for every day.
934,III,This man has God and love and life;
935,III,"These stand, all else shall pass away."
936,III,
937,III,"And “this man’s” days were long, long days: Kilmer’s home, a place"
938,III,of boundless week-end hospitality and almost equally boundless
939,III,domesticity (guests being obliged to exercise much agility in
940,III,"clambering about toys with which the stairs were laden), was also year"
941,III,after year a place of almost unbelievable literary industry. The trying
942,III,idiosyncrasies of the artistic temperament were about as discernible
943,III,"in Kilmer as kleptomania. He was, as you may say, social and domestic"
944,III,in his habits of writing to an amazing degree. Night after night he
945,III,would radiantly walk up and down the floor singing a lullaby to one of
946,III,his children whom he carried screaming in his arms while he dictated
947,III,between vociferous sounds to his secretary or wife--his wife frequently
948,III,driven by the drowsiness of two in the morning to take short naps with
949,III,her head upon the typewriter while the literally tireless journalist
950,III,filled and lighted his pipe.
951,III,
952,III,"This, however, was an atmosphere of cloistral seclusion compared with"
953,III,"Kilmer’s office at the _New York Times_. Here, where he regularly got"
954,III,through each week enough hard work to hold down three or four fairly
955,III,"capable young men, he maintained a sort of salon for a ludicrous"
956,III,variety of picturesque characters with nothing in particular to do and
957,III,"no place else to go, ranging from types of patrician leisure to stray"
958,III,dogs of the literary world visibly out of a job.
959,III,
960,III,"The latter class, indeed, apparently regarded him as a kind of a"
961,III,clearing house for employment. A singularly convincing commentary on
962,III,the radiating humanity of this brilliant young man was one rather
963,III,grotesque feature of his mail. In addition to a constant and copious
964,III,"stream of requests from persons but slightly known, or quite unknown to"
965,III,"him, for advice as to how to succeed in letters, and for his personal"
966,III,"imprimatur on their enclosed manuscripts, he was apparently constantly"
967,III,"in receipt of innumerable epistolary stories of extraordinary distress,"
968,III,suffered (generally) by elderly characters defeated in the lists of
969,III,literature. Though there was in Kilmer’s robust nature a decided
970,III,"distaste, somewhat analogous to the innate aversion of the clean in"
971,III,"spirit to moral obliquity, for what he termed “ineffectual people,”"
972,III,there was too an amusing strain of paternal feeling toward most of
973,III,those of all ages with whom he was in contact. And this feeling he did
974,III,"not neglect, whenever the occasion arose, to translate into practical"
975,III,effect.
976,III,
977,III,He had a comical manner of terming his elders “young” So-and-So. I
978,III,"was six years his senior, which at the period of life at which we"
979,III,"met represented a considerable difference in experience. And yet,"
980,III,"throughout our association, in spiritual force he was the oak, I the"
981,III,clinging vine. And I know of cases where this was quite as much so when
982,III,the other man was something like fifteen years the elder. One such
983,III,"instance, ludicrous in its contrast between the two men, was confessed"
984,III,to me with deep feeling just the other day.
985,III,
986,III,“So-long” or “good-bye” was seldom Kilmer’s parting word. It was rather
987,III,a word he continually used which will be thought of as peculiarly his
988,III,"as long as his memory endures, the closing word of “Rouge Bouquet.” The"
989,III,"last time I saw him at his home, then at Larchmont Manor, New York,"
990,III,"my companion (in marriage) and I upon leaving almost missed our car,"
991,III,which started a block or so from the Kilmer house. As the three of us
992,III,"dashed after it, Kilmer stopped this car by what seemed to me something"
993,III,"like sheer force of his willing it to stop. Then, as he dropped away"
994,III,"from the race, there came from him high and clear out of the night (and"
995,III,always shall I hear it ring) his benediction: “Farewell! Children.”
996,III,"Yes, it is even so; as the spirit is measured and the frailties of"
997,III,"the soul are numbered, how many who knew this wondrous boy were his"
998,III,“children”!
999,III,
1000,III,The wisdom of the maxim “A busy man is never too busy to do one thing
1001,III,more” was indisputable in the spectacle of Kilmer. Though this was
1002,III,"not, so far as I recollect, a maxim he employed, he had one of his own"
1003,III,"something like it, which admirably summed up his practical philosophy."
1004,III,"When confronted by some financial dilemma, he was fond of declaring:"
1005,III,“The demand creates the supply. A sound economic principle.” He seemed
1006,III,to crave serious responsibilities and insistent obligations as some men
1007,III,crave liquor; and he grew more rosy as these increased.
1008,III,
1009,III,Thank God for the mighty tide of fears
1010,III,Against me always hurled!
1011,III,"Thank God for the bitter and ceaseless strife,"
1012,III,And the sting of His chastening rod!
1013,III,
1014,III,There was nothing incongruous to Kilmer about the incongruity expressed
1015,III,"in a communication written in 1916 to the Reverend Edward F. Garesché,"
1016,III,"S. J.; a letter which began by saying, “I am sorry that your letter of"
1017,III,"October 11 has been so long unanswered, but this has been the busiest"
1018,III,month of my life”; which then told of his looping the loop of the
1019,III,country in lecture engagements; proceeded to discuss a matter which
1020,III,"had made a strong appeal to his heart, the founding of an Academy of"
1021,III,Catholic Letters to be called the Marian Institute; and concluded with
1022,III,"the remark, “I will gladly take on the work of acting secretary until"
1023,III,the members make their own selection.”
1024,III,
1025,III,
1026,IV,IV
1027,IV,
1028,IV,"In 1913, Kilmer’s daughter Rose, nine months of age, was stricken with"
1029,IV,"infantile paralysis. It was then, upon his bringing his family to town"
1030,IV,"to give his daughter the treatment of a specialist, when he came to my"
1031,IV,"house to tell me of this, that I first distinctly realised that this"
1032,IV,young man was remarkable--in a manner far beyond mere talent. The idea
1033,IV,which he kept firmly before his mind was that it had been declared
1034,IV,there was no occasion to fear her death as a result of her affliction.
1035,IV,"During the course of his stay with me that day he said several times,"
1036,IV,"“Well, there are lots of people worse off than I am.” This idea, too,"
1037,IV,"it was apparent, he felt he must hold before him. And then, with his"
1038,IV,"amazing and unconquerable _flair_ for life, he launched upon the"
1039,IV,"theme that this was a “very interesting disease,” and he elaborated"
1040,IV,the thought that an infirmity of the body frequently resulted in an
1041,IV,increased vitality of the mind.
1042,IV,
1043,IV,"“I like to feel that I have always been a Catholic,” was a sentiment"
1044,IV,frequently expressed by Kilmer. It has repeatedly been declared by
1045,IV,friends very close to him that his minute knowledge of pious customs
1046,IV,and practices of which a life-long Catholic might easily be ignorant
1047,IV,"was a constant surprise to them, but that with respect to religion as"
1048,IV,"particularised in himself he kept silent, would never discuss the steps"
1049,IV,"that led to his conversion, and it was only by chance they discovered"
1050,IV,he was a daily communicant. It was late in 1918 that Kilmer astonished
1051,IV,"the little world that then comprised his family, his friends and"
1052,IV,"acquaintances by entering, with his wife, the Roman Catholic Church."
1053,IV,One afternoon not long after this occurrence he not so much invited as
1054,IV,directed me over the telephone to meet him that night for dinner at the
1055,IV,Columbia Club. His purpose soon became clear. This was the only solemn
1056,IV,hour I ever spent with Kilmer. I think it well to record here what he
1057,IV,deeply impressed upon me: that it was this searing test of his spirit
1058,IV,which had come upon him in the affliction of his daughter that fixed
1059,IV,his religion.
1060,IV,
1061,IV,Kilmer did not become a great patriot when his country entered the
1062,IV,"world war. He was, of course, the same in fibre then as before. Only"
1063,IV,then was known to him and visible to others what was latent in his
1064,IV,"heart. And in this sense it was, I think, that it was clear to him that"
1065,IV,"he did not become, but had always been a Catholic, though he had not"
1066,IV,earlier realised it. He tried all things and held fast to that which he
1067,IV,found good. He was inwardly driven to seek until his spirit found its
1068,IV,"home. That only the time of his conversion was, in a sense, accidental,"
1069,IV,"and that the conversion itself was inevitable, must be evident in the"
1070,IV,"fact that he was never really himself before he became, as we say, a"
1071,IV,"convert. Then his fluid spirituality, his yearning sense of religion,"
1072,IV,"was stabilized. What is the “secret,” as we say, of all that has been"
1073,IV,"told of his ability? His courage, his mental and physical energy, were,"
1074,IV,"manifestly, unusual. But his character, in the faith that he embraced,"
1075,IV,found its tempered spring. His talent was a wingéd seed which in the
1076,IV,rich soil which had mothered so much art found fructification.
1077,IV,
1078,IV,It is not an unsupported assertion to say that he was in his time and
1079,IV,place the laureate of the Catholic Church. His sentiments as to the
1080,IV,function of a Catholic poet he has expressed very positively in his
1081,IV,essays and lectures. He joyed in the new proof given by Helen Parry
1082,IV,Eden “that piety and mirth may comfortably dwell together.” “A convert
1083,IV,"to Catholicism,” he wrote of Mr. Yeats on Lionel Johnson, “is not a"
1084,IV,"person who wanders about weeping over autumn winds and dead leaves,"
1085,IV,mumbling Latin and sniffing incense.” Nor is it necessary to lay
1086,IV,"æsthetic hands on the church’s treasures, “and decorate rhymes with"
1087,IV,rich ecclesiastical imagery and the fragrant names of the saints.”
1088,IV,But in Faith one may find “that purity and strength which are the
1089,IV,guarantees of immortality.”
1090,IV,
1091,IV,"And, once a Catholic, there never was any possibility of mistaking"
1092,IV,"Kilmer’s point of view: in all matters of religion, art, economics and"
1093,IV,"politics, as well as in all matters of faith and morals, his point of"
1094,IV,view was obviously and unhesitatingly Catholic. Considerable as were
1095,IV,"his gifts and skill as a politician in the business of his career, the"
1096,IV,veriest zealot could not say that he did not do the most unpolitic
1097,IV,"things in the service of his faith. A very positive figure, he laboured"
1098,IV,"tirelessly, alternating from one field to another, for the Catholic"
1099,IV,Church.
1100,IV,
1101,IV,"As a brilliant interpretative critic of Catholic writers, such as"
1102,IV,"Crashaw, Patmore, Francis Thompson, Lionel Johnson and Belloc, he"
1103,IV,"brought, I think I may venture to say, an altogether new touch into"
1104,IV,"Catholic journalism in America, a striking and distinguished blend of"
1105,IV,"“piety and mirth,” which had the rare and highly effective quality"
1106,IV,"of being both engaging and highly illuminating even to, as Kilmer"
1107,IV,"would amiably have said, the Pagan. Impetus, of course, was given"
1108,IV,to his style in this by his admiration for the brilliant school of
1109,IV,"English Catholic journalists, an impetus doubtless accelerated by the"
1110,IV,"personal acquaintance with Belloc, the Chestertons and the Meynells"
1111,IV,he gained in a flying visit to England in 1914 to rescue his mother
1112,IV,"from war difficulties in London; when, during a few odd moments before"
1113,IV,"his return, he established a lively connection with the Northcliffe"
1114,IV,"papers and _T. P.’s Weekly_. Even so, Kilmer almost, or quite, alone"
1115,IV,transplanted this particular spark; and his note of witty common sense
1116,IV,"and spiritual sensibility was particularly Kilmerian, too."
1117,IV,
1118,IV,One day about four years ago the village Post Office at Mahwah did a
1119,IV,"totally unprecedented and most extraordinary business in outgoing mail,"
1120,IV,and Kilmer was again multiplied manifold. The neat circulars which
1121,IV,he had printed and with which he stuffed the mail box announced that
1122,IV,"the author of “Trees,” a member of the staff of the _New York Times_,"
1123,IV,"etc., etc., “offered the following lectures for the coming season.” The"
1124,IV,result may best be epitomised in the parable of the gentleman who cast
1125,IV,his bread upon the waters to have it come back to him in the form of
1126,IV,"sardine sandwiches. The rapid development of Kilmer’s lecture business,"
1127,IV,"which soon assumed the proportions of no mean career in itself,"
1128,IV,immensely extended his force as a quickening influence in the Catholic
1129,IV,"world. Before societies and educational institutions in many places,"
1130,IV,"frequently travelling as far as Notre Dame, Indiana, and Prairie du"
1131,IV,"Chien, Wisconsin, he flung his bright portraits of “seekers after that"
1132,IV,"real but elusive thing called beauty, a thing which they found in their"
1133,IV,"submission to her who is the mother of all learning, all culture, and"
1134,IV,"all the arts, the Catholic Church.”"
1135,IV,
1136,IV,
1137,V,V
1138,V,
1139,V,As a literary lecturer and a reader of his own poems before secular
1140,V,audiences his success was no less abundant. In “the only combination of
1141,V,"its kind since Bill Nye and James Whitcomb Riley,” as the circular of"
1142,V,"the J. B. Pond Lyceum Bureau stated it, “the young American Poet” and"
1143,V,the author of “Pigs is Pigs” contributed considerably to the lightening
1144,V,of the rigours of existence by an extended repetition of “a joint
1145,V,"evening of readings from their works.” Ellis Parker Butler, in a letter"
1146,V,"before me, writes of his partner on the programme:"
1147,V,
1148,V,He was a most charming travelling companion and an ideal
1149,V,team-mate for the purpose we had in mind. I would not have
1150,V,thought of going “on tour” if I had not met Kilmer. My idea was
1151,V,"never to “go on tour” but, after I had met Kilmer, to “go on"
1152,V,tour with Kilmer.” He was altogether lovable and loved.
1153,V,
1154,V,"It would be a decidedly false estimate of Kilmer which failed to note,"
1155,V,"even with some emphasis, that he was an excellent man of business."
1156,V,"He “played the game,” in the exceedingly difficult job of earning"
1157,V,"a thoroughly competent living at the literary profession, with a"
1158,V,"dexterity which, it was frequently apparent, was at once an inspiration"
1159,V,and a despair to those who sought to rival him. The Kilmer cult which
1160,V,grew apace was considerably accelerated by a rich Kilmerian strategy.
1161,V,And he delivered to the little world of intensely intense literary
1162,V,societies and blue-nosed salons which hung upon his lips the pure milk
1163,V,of the word with a strongly humorous consciousness of the feat as a
1164,V,part of the immense sport of living.
1165,V,
1166,V,Kilmer’s “act” as it was observed from behind the scenes is excellently
1167,V,presented by an associate in the office of the _New York Times_. This
1168,V,writer says in the _Philadelphia Press_:
1169,V,
1170,V,"Our editor analysed him into three distinct manners: Kilmer,"
1171,V,"the literary man; Kilmer, the lecturer; and Kilmer, himself."
1172,V,His first appearance in the office would give you the cue to
1173,V,him for the day. If he came in grinning with his pipe drawing
1174,V,"well, we would know that nothing was to be feared; he was"
1175,V,"himself. When he got his “literary” manner on, the symptom"
1176,V,"was a tapping of his eyeglass, with his right hand on the"
1177,V,fingers of his left. When he appeared in his cutaway coat and
1178,V,"a particularly pastoral necktie, we knew that on that day"
1179,V,the elderly ladies of This Literary Club or the young ladies
1180,V,of That Academy were to be treated to a discourse on certain
1181,V,aspects of Victorian verse.
1182,V,
1183,V,"One day he came in, obviously decked out for a lecture. Without"
1184,V,"his having said a word about it, the assistant Sunday editor"
1185,V,spoke up: “Let’s cut out work this afternoon and hear Kilmer
1186,V,lecture.” A look of horror overspread his face. “For heaven’s
1187,V,"sake, don’t,” he said. “I couldn’t go through with it.” I don’t"
1188,V,believe any of us ever did hear him.
1189,V,
1190,V,"A thing which I found very singular was that, in manner Kilmer was"
1191,V,"apt, in the two or three later years of his life, to give strangers on"
1192,V,their first meeting the impression of being somewhat too dignified for
1193,V,"so young a man, of being, as his office associate John Bunker in an"
1194,V,"admirable, even a remarkable, portrait of him at this period published"
1195,V,"in _America_, says, “in fact just a trifle pompous.” Mr. Bunker"
1196,V,"continues: “This was due partly to his physical appearance, and also,"
1197,V,"insofar as it had any basis in reality, to that protective instinct"
1198,V,which quickly teaches a sensitive and imaginative spirit to cast a veil
1199,V,between itself and the outer world.”
1200,V,
1201,V,I myself think this effect had its origin in the same perverse instinct
1202,V,"which causes you, immediately after talking with a deaf person, to"
1203,V,speak very loud to your next auditor whom you very well know can hear
1204,V,"perfectly; that is, it was the result of being keyed up to appearing on"
1205,V,an elevated platform before a curious throng. He one time astonished
1206,V,"me by the declaration that it was only by, quite early in his life,"
1207,V,"drastically schooling himself to the task, one then exceedingly trying"
1208,V,"and hateful to him, that he became able to rise and “speak” at all."
1209,V,"The most entertaining recollection, by the way, that I have of the"
1210,V,Kilmerian pontifical manner is of a time when he generously invited
1211,V,"me to have my shoes polished with him, thrust his hand deep into his"
1212,V,"pocket to pay the boy, paused, and with a very large gesture directed"
1213,V,him to call in again later in the day.
1214,V,
1215,V,There is first-rate perspicacity in the remark of one of Kilmer’s
1216,V,"friends, Laurence J. Gomme, that at one score and ten he was, in the"
1217,V,"amount that he had lived, about seventy years old. Something of the"
1218,V,force and sharpness of Mr. Bunker’s evocation of the man as he was at
1219,V,"last resides, I think, in the circumstance that here is no blending in"
1220,V,the mind of the flower and the bud. He says: “When I first met Kilmer
1221,V,"he had just passed his thirtieth year, but he gave me the impression"
1222,V,"of being somewhat older. I afterwards spoke of this to him, and it was"
1223,V,his theory that newspaper work had served to age him. The truth was
1224,V,"that it was due not merely to his newspaper work, but generally to the"
1225,V,"incessant and intense mental activity, the extraordinary and flaming"
1226,V,"energy, whereby he crowded into ten years the experiences of several"
1227,V,"ordinary lifetimes.” And this touch of the slight Bunker portrait is, I"
1228,V,"feel, essential to any fuller picture:"
1229,V,
1230,V,"As to his physical aspect, he was stockily built and about"
1231,V,"medium height, and his habit of body was what I should call"
1232,V,"plump, though later, under the stress of military drill, he"
1233,V,changed somewhat in this last respect. I noted at once that
1234,V,"he had a remarkable head--well rounded, with broad and high"
1235,V,"forehead and a very pronounced bulge at the back, covered"
1236,V,"thickly with dark, reddish-brown hair. But his eyes were his"
1237,V,most remarkable feature. They were of the unusual colour of
1238,V,"red, and they had a most peculiar quality which I can only"
1239,V,inadequately suggest by saying that they literally glowed. It
1240,V,"actually seemed as if there were a fire behind them, not a"
1241,V,"leaping and blazing fire, but a steady and unquenchable flame"
1242,V,which appeared to suffuse the whole eyeball with a brooding
1243,V,light. This characteristic was so striking that I cannot help
1244,V,"dilating on it. And I observed later on that this glow, this"
1245,V,"brooding and somewhat sombre light, never left his eyes even in"
1246,V,"his most weary or most care-free moments, so that they gave the"
1247,V,impression of what I believe was the fact--the impression of a
1248,V,brain behind them which was working intensely and perhaps even
1249,V,feverishly every hour of the waking day.
1250,V,
1251,V,"The better poet Kilmer became, as his friend Richardson Wright says in"
1252,V,"his admirable “Appreciation” in _The Bellman_, the less like a poet he"
1253,V,"acted. And after he grew up, he would about as soon have æstheticised,"
1254,V,"off the platform, as he would have forged a check. Whenever he did"
1255,V,"refer to poetry as related to himself he, as the slang term has it,"
1256,V,took it smiling. One of Kilmer’s most pronounced pet aversions was the
1257,V,"phrase, utterly mawkish to him, about “prostituting” one’s talent."
1258,V,"He one time explained to me, with considerable apparent pride, that"
1259,V,"he used every idea three times: in a poem, in an article, and in a"
1260,V,lecture.
1261,V,
1262,V,"Charles Willis Thompson, an editorial writer of the _New York Times_,"
1263,V,"and to whom belongs the credit of first taking, as editor of the"
1264,V,"_Sunday Magazine_ and _Book Review_, Kilmer’s “stuff” in any amount,"
1265,V,"inspired, so to say, the poem “Delicatessen,” in this way. Mr. Thompson"
1266,V,happened to remark to Kilmer that of course there were a lot of
1267,V,things which couldn’t be treated in poetry. Kilmer declared he would
1268,V,like to know what they were. Mr. Thompson cast about in his mind for
1269,V,"the most ridiculous theme for a poem he could think of, and finally"
1270,V,proclaimed that no one could possibly write a poem about such a thing
1271,V,"as a delicatessen shop. “I’ll write a poem about a delicatessen shop,”"
1272,V,Kilmer promptly replied. “It will be a long poem. I’ll sell it to a
1273,V,high-brow magazine. It will be much admired. And it will be a good
1274,V,poem.” He insisted on betting on this the sum of several dollars.
1275,V,
1276,V,The origin of “The Twelve-Forty-Five” I do not exactly know. But I
1277,V,"remember shortly before that poem was written, sitting disgusted and"
1278,V,miserable with Kilmer in that horrible “Jersey City shed” waiting for
1279,V,"the midnight train. Taking out of his mouth that villainously large,"
1280,V,"fifty-cent pipe (mentioned in all genuine appreciations) Kilmer, with"
1281,V,"a fervour almost violent, suddenly exclaimed: “I certainly do like"
1282,V,railroad stations! They are fine places!” The very famous poem “The
1283,V,White Ships and The Red” (a poem so wonderfully effective that it was
1284,V,at once reprinted all over the country and in Europe) was a newspaper
1285,V,assignment. He rather liked the poem when he saw it in the paper;
1286,V,"though, with his feet cocked up on his desk, he spoke apologetically"
1287,V,of what he felt to be the failure of the latter stanzas to link up
1288,V,"perfectly with the first, explaining that a luncheon appointment, at"
1289,V,"which he chatted for an hour or two, had split the writing of it into"
1290,V,two sittings. That the author of this “Lusitania” poem thoroughly felt
1291,V,"and meant what he said, is, I fancy, sufficiently proven by the event"
1292,V,to permit of this being told.
1293,V,
1294,V,"The point is, that Kilmer was a poet, an artist of a high order, a"
1295,V,perfectly conscious master of what he was doing. The febrile gush of
1296,V,emotion he loathed. He knew finely that:
1297,V,
1298,V,"It is stern work, it is perilous work, to thrust your hand in the sun"
1299,V,And pull out a spark of immortal flame to warm the hearts of men.
1300,V,
1301,V,"There was nothing accidental about the effect of his own verse, any"
1302,V,more than there was “luck” in his worldly success. He achieved the one
1303,V,as he did the other by a masculine heart and mind. And while all things
1304,V,"were necessary and joyous, it was impossible not to feel that, after"
1305,V,"all, throughout his day “the rhymer’s honest trade” was his primary"
1306,V,concern.
1307,V,
1308,V,"He was sufficiently grounded in literature to feel, as Mr. Le Gallienne"
1309,V,"says, no “weariness with those literary methods which had sufficed for"
1310,V,"Chaucer and Shakespeare and Milton, or Catullus or Bion, or François"
1311,V,"Villon--content, with reverent ambition, to tread that immortal path.”"
1312,V,
1313,V,"In his religious mysticism a trace, and more than a trace, has been"
1314,V,"found of Crashaw, of Vaughan, of Herbert, and of Belloc and Chesterton."
1315,V,And there is no difficulty at all about finding in Kilmer hints of
1316,V,"Patmore, and there may be easily recognised something of the accents"
1317,V,"of A. E. Housman and of Edwin Arlington Robinson. He did, indeed, to"
1318,V,"put it in a racy phrase, have the drop on those who do not know that"
1319,V,all art that endures must have its roots in a constant interrogation of
1320,V,the “unimpeachable testimony” of the ages. His song was as old as the
1321,V,"hills, and as fresh as the morning. Precisely in this, in fact, is his"
1322,V,"remarkableness, his originality, as a contemporary poet; and in this"
1323,V,"will be, I think, his abiding quality. “Simple and direct, yet not"
1324,V,"without subtle magic,” wrote Father James J. Daly, S.J., in a review"
1325,V,"of “Trees and Other Poems,” printed in _America_, his verse “seems"
1326,V,"artlessly naïve, yet it possesses deep undercurrents of masculine and"
1327,V,"forceful thought; it is ethical in its seriousness, and yet as playful"
1328,V,and light-hearted as sunlight and shadows under summer oaks.” And this
1329,V,admirable summing up of Kilmer’s talent leaves little more in the way
1330,V,of direct criticism to be said.
1331,V,
1332,V,"Mr. Le Gallienne with felicitous tact of phrase has touched upon this,"
1333,V,"that “no young poet of our time has so reverently, on so many pages, in"
1334,V,"so many different ways, so playfully at times, as in that masterpiece"
1335,V,"of playful reverence, ‘A Blue Valentine,’ woven through the texture"
1336,V,"of his song the love of his lady--that lady ‘Aline,’ whose name will"
1337,V,be gently twined about his as long as the printed word endures.” A
1338,V,misquotation in the _Ladies’ Home Journal_ led to an interesting
1339,V,tribute to the author of “Trees.” Many readers of the _Journal_ were
1340,V,somewhat startled to find the editor attributing to John Masefield the
1341,V,lines:
1342,V,
1343,V,A tree that looks at God all day
1344,V,And lifts her leafy arms to pray.
1345,V,
1346,V,The following issue of the magazine contained this correction and
1347,V,acknowledgment by Mr. Bok:
1348,V,
1349,V,I am free to confess that I did not know the correct author. I
1350,V,had been reading John Masefield that morning and unconsciously
1351,V,wrote his name as the author of these lines. A number of
1352,V,friends have pointed to the error and supplied the knowledge.
1353,V,"The author is Joyce Kilmer, and to him I owe, and here express,"
1354,V,my sense of deep apology. The exquisite lines were worthy of
1355,V,"John Masefield, but that does not make them less worthy of"
1356,V,"their rightful author, as all will agree who read his beautiful"
1357,V,work in his book “Trees and Other Poems.”
1358,V,
1359,V,"As one, somewhat effusive commentator has remarked, “Trees” just could"
1360,V,not be confined within the covers of a book. At once reprinted in
1361,V,newspapers throughout the United States (and still being so reprinted)
1362,V,it was crowned in that warmest of all ways in which a work of
1363,V,"literature can be honoured, by being cut out by the world and pasted in"
1364,V,"its hat. In one version it reads, in part, in this way:"
1365,V,
1366,V,Cuando contemplo un arbol pienso: nunca vere un poema tan bello
1367,V,y tan intenso.
1368,V,
1369,V,Un arbol silencioso que con ansia se aferra a la dulce y jugosa
1370,V,entrans de la tierra.
1371,V,
1372,V,Un arbol que mirando los cielos se extansia y en oracion
1373,V,levanta los brazos noche y dia.
1374,V,
1375,V,Many of Kilmer’s poems have been translated into Spanish by Salomon de
1376,V,"la Selva, Enriquez Urenia and others, and have appeared in a number of"
1377,V,prominent South American papers.
1378,V,
1379,V,"In a letter from France to Edward W. Cook, who in quest of material"
1380,V,for a book on contemporary poets had written Kilmer asking several
1381,V,"questions, Kilmer commented, among other things, on his “earlier"
1382,V,"efforts in poetry” (as the questionnaire apparently had put it), in"
1383,V,a manner which is evidence again of how perfectly well he knew what
1384,V,"he was about. “If what I nowadays write is considered poetry,” he"
1385,V,"announced, “then I became a poet in November, 1913.” Admirable for"
1386,V,"hard-headedness, directness and precision, it is a statement which"
1387,V,leaves the critic no point upon which to take issue. His early poems
1388,V,"“were only the exercises of an amateur, imitations, useful only as"
1389,V,technical training.” The peculiar thing about these highly skilful
1390,V,experiments in various forms of craftsmanship is that they were so very
1391,V,much better as poems than the derivative efforts usually written at
1392,V,"this period of apprenticeship, “so free,” as Mr. Le Gallienne notes,"
1393,V,“from those artistic immaturities which have made many old great poets
1394,V,angrily denounce unlicensed reprinters of their ‘first editions.’” And
1395,V,"in this fact they have a decided, and a perfectly legitimate, interest"
1396,V,for the observer of the development of his talent--though Kilmer
1397,V,"declared “they were worthless, that is, all of them which preceded a"
1398,V,"poem called ‘Pennies,’ which you will find in my book ‘Trees and Other"
1399,V,"Poems.’” He added, “I want all of my poems written before that to be"
1400,V,forgotten.”
1401,V,
1402,V,"He was writing, one remembers, to a gentleman with whom he was so"
1403,V,"slightly acquainted that he addressed him as “Dear Mr. Cook,” with the"
1404,V,"measure of whose sympathy and critical acumen, it is to be inferred, he"
1405,V,"was not conversant, and who presumably was about to estimate (with what"
1406,V,perspective he could not perceive) his earliest productions. It were
1407,V,"better to head off any uncertainty in the matter. Also, we all know,"
1408,V,one’s hot impatience with one’s strivings of yesterday is mellowed
1409,V,by time into an amiable and appreciative tolerance of one’s earnest
1410,V,efforts of twenty years ago. It is difficult to think that Kilmer at
1411,V,fifty would have had an unjust scorn of those charming exercises on the
1412,V,poetic scales he wrote at twenty-one.
1413,V,
1414,V,"Anyhow, no man can, by decree or otherwise, obliterate his past; both"
1415,V,the good and the bad that he has done continue to pursue him. Ten times
1416,V,"thrice happy is he, rarest of men, who, like Kilmer, never penned a"
1417,V,line or said a word or did a deed that can arise to bring confusion
1418,V,to those that love him. The world does not willingly let die those
1419,V,verses on which glistens the dew of his tender youth. They are brought
1420,V,forth for praise by no mean critics in tribute to his memory. And in
1421,V,conformity with the wishes of those most jealous of his good name as
1422,V,a poet a representative selection of his early poems is reprinted in
1423,V,these volumes.
1424,V,
1425,V,"He that lives by the pen shall perish by the pen, saith the wisdom of"
1426,V,"James Huneker. For a sapling poet, within a few short years and by the"
1427,V,"hard business of words, to attain to a secretary and a butler and a"
1428,V,"family of, at length, four children, is a modern Arabian Nights Tale."
1429,V,"Equally impossible is it, seemingly, to accomplish another thing, which"
1430,V,"is a remarkable part of Kilmer’s distinction. From first to last, from"
1431,V,"the verses contributed to _Moods_ in 1909 to the last poem he wrote,"
1432,V,"“The Peacemaker,” printed in the _Saturday Evening Post_ in October,"
1433,V,"1918, Kilmer was a poet’s poet. “A pretty good poet,” said such a poet"
1434,V,(shaking his head at his conviction of the truth of this) as Bliss
1435,V,Carman. His poems were repeatedly adjudged high places among the best
1436,V,"poems read before the Poetry Society. Among competitive honours, under"
1437,V,"the name of “John Langdon” he won easily enough with his poem, “The"
1438,V,"Annunciation,” first prize in the Marian Poetry contest conducted by"
1439,V,"_The Queen’s Work_, in July, 1917, an award competed for by a great"
1440,V,"number of poets, including many in other countries. He was a poet’s"
1441,V,"poet who declared (with considerable vehemence, I remember) that he"
1442,V,certainly wished he had written “Casey At The Bat.” He one time said
1443,V,in praise of a book of essays that it was “that kind of glorified
1444,V,reporting which is poetry.” As a singer of the simpler annals of
1445,V,"humanity his place will draw closer and closer, I think, to that of the"
1446,V,most widely loved poet of our own era. Only the name of James Whitcomb
1447,V,Riley expresses in greater measure the rich gift of speaking with
1448,V,authentic song to the simplest hearts. A man who believes that churches
1449,V,are devices of the devil and literature a syrup for crack-brained
1450,V,"females can enjoy, with profit to his soul, “The House With Nobody In"
1451,V,"it,” “Dave Lilly” and “The Servant Girl and the Grocer’s Boy” equally"
1452,V,with “The Old Swimmin’-Hole” and “Little Orphant Annie.”
1453,V,
1454,V,If Colonel Roosevelt had never done anything other than what he has
1455,V,"done in writing, he would undoubtedly be highly esteemed as an American"
1456,V,man of letters. And people have made very creditable reputations as
1457,V,humourists who never wrote anything like as humorous essays as those of
1458,V,Joyce Kilmer. They fairly reek with the joy of life. They explode with
1459,V,"intellectual robustness. They are fragrant in fancy, richly erudite"
1460,V,"in substance, touch-and-go in manner, poetic in feeling, rocking with"
1461,V,"mirth, and display an extraordinary _flair_ for style. If it should"
1462,V,seem that I am not here measuring my words I suggest a reference to
1463,V,a piece of documentary evidence called “The Gentle Art of Christmas
1464,V,"Giving,” a “Sunday story” in the _New York Times_, here reprinted."
1465,V,"Writing at top-notch speed, never looking again at what he had written,"
1466,V,"intentionally producing a readily marketable commodity, from which"
1467,V,"profit must be realised quickly, Kilmer was an exceedingly rare bird in"
1468,V,"America; that is, a belletristic journalist. There is always the touch"
1469,V,"to his work of a man of letters. Decidedly Bellocian, Chestertonian,"
1470,V,certainly his humorous essays are. But that it was a good deal more an
1471,V,"affinity of mind with, than an imitation of, those splendidly humorous"
1472,V,English philosophers is borne out by this: Joyce Kilmer did not talk
1473,V,"poetry, but he did talk exactly like his essays, which admirably"
1474,V,present the brave humorous wisdom of the man as his intimate friends
1475,V,knew him.
1476,V,
1477,V,Official critical authority did not dampen his verve. As a contributing
1478,V,"editor of “Warner’s Library of the World’s Best Literature,” he"
1479,V,"supplied the articles on Madison Cawein, John Masefield, William"
1480,V,Vaughn Moody and Francis Thompson. He contributed prefaces to various
1481,V,volumes of standard authors. Excellent examples of this department
1482,V,of his activity are his Introduction to Thomas Hardy’s “The Mayor of
1483,V,"Casterbridge” in the Modern Library, his introduction to the American"
1484,V,"edition of the “Verses” of Hilaire Belloc, and the introduction to"
1485,V,"the volume “Dreams and Images,” his anthology of Catholic poets. The"
1486,V,"Introduction to this Anthology is dated 165th Regiment, Camp Mills,"
1487,V,"Mineola, N. Y., August, 1917, just a year before Sergeant Kilmer’s"
1488,V,death in battle. Doubtless few know that at one time Kilmer had drawn
1489,V,a contract to write a “Life” of Father Tabb. Because of peculiar
1490,V,"complications in the situation this enterprise, most unfortunately,"
1491,V,fell through. In 1916 Kilmer was called to the faculty of the School of
1492,V,"Journalism of New York University, in succession to Arthur Guiterman,"
1493,V,"to lecture on “Magazine and Newspaper Verse.” The object of the course,"
1494,V,which was open to outsiders as well as to those enrolled in the School
1495,V,"of Journalism, was to familiarise the students with the practical side"
1496,V,of writing verse for publication.
1497,V,
1498,V,
1499,VI,VI
1500,VI,
1501,VI,"It seems rather a misnomer, and something of an absurdity, to say that"
1502,VI,Kilmer was ever neutral in anything. But in the political sense he was
1503,VI,"a neutral, and, if it may be put that way, neutral to a pronounced"
1504,VI,"degree, preceding the entrance of the United States into the war. His"
1505,VI,"keen feeling for the sturdy virtues and robust customs of Old England,"
1506,VI,"Merrie England, was of course, patent. His delight in London, and the"
1507,VI,"English countryside, which he knew from a child, was manifest. The"
1508,VI,"pillars of his fairly large literature were, of course, English. His"
1509,VI,profound sense of integrity was violently jolted by the violation
1510,VI,"of Belgium. As the war went on, however, he developed an attitude"
1511,VI,"which was quite capable of being interpreted as Pro-German, by anyone"
1512,VI,interested in so interpreting it. The explanation of this attitude is
1513,VI,"simple enough. Instinctively a combative character intellectually,"
1514,VI,"his humorous essays, which expressed him so intimately, almost without"
1515,VI,exception found their spring in his running counter to some current
1516,VI,"idea. As he one time remarked, he was “bored by feminism, futurism,"
1517,VI,"free love;” and, too, he was invariably for the under dog. It may seem"
1518,VI,rather grotesque to present Germany by implication as an under dog in
1519,VI,"the early years of the war; the point is, the force of the argument"
1520,VI,was so overwhelmingly against Germany that Kilmer reacted to this in a
1521,VI,"characteristic fashion, stood boldly against the current, and was, in"
1522,VI,"fact, a neutral--until the sinking of the Lusitania. All reports agree,"
1523,VI,including even reports from sources of strong anti-English feeling
1524,VI,where Kilmer’s inclination to see what could be said for Germany was
1525,VI,"coveted, that from this point on his manner was altogether hostile to"
1526,VI,"Germany. Outside of his Lusitania poem he did not, so far as I know,"
1527,VI,denounce the deed; but the unanimity and the precision with which the
1528,VI,change in him is fixed by all who observed him is striking.
1529,VI,
1530,VI,Kilmer’s successive literary passions were a curious medley. He seemed
1531,VI,"to have been born with a great love for Scott, and he held stoutly to"
1532,VI,Sir Walter throughout the years. In his burly days he found a humorous
1533,VI,"sport in defending, with jovial emphasis, the old-fashioned chivalrous"
1534,VI,romance against the scientific modern novel. In his æsthetic period he
1535,VI,"had a touch, hardly more, of Oscar Wilde, though early in his literary"
1536,VI,career he experienced a rather severe case of Swinburneitus. Some time
1537,VI,shortly after this he was very much intrigued by the Celtic revival.
1538,VI,"Shaemas O’Sheel, a friend dating back to Columbia days, bears testimony"
1539,VI,that an early boast of Kilmer’s was that an ancestor of his had been
1540,VI,hanged for taking a rebel’s part in ’ninety-eight. And though as we
1541,VI,"know, Kilmer’s immediate ancestry was not Irish, a Gaelic enthusiast"
1542,VI,"who has made a specialty of the Irish language, suggests in his ardour,"
1543,VI,"that the name Kilmer is a derivation of Mac Gilla Mor. At any rate, an"
1544,VI,"affection for Ireland--her literature, her lore, her traditions, and"
1545,VI,her people--was indeed natural with him.
1546,VI,
1547,VI,In his Yeats period Kilmer had about chosen “Nine Bean Rows” as the
1548,VI,"name of his house then in the course of construction, though it was"
1549,VI,not altogether “of clay and wattles made.” The thing which deterred
1550,VI,him from this decision was that persons unacquainted with the poem
1551,VI,"“Innisfree,” to whom he spoke of the matter, conceived his address as"
1552,VI,"Number Nine Beanrose Avenue. What a funny street, they said, that is."
1553,VI,"Literary merely, of course, that; and though a part of the whole,"
1554,VI,"remote from later, deeper and graver things. Something inherently Irish"
1555,VI,"in Kilmer undoubtedly was felt by many, Irish themselves and very much"
1556,VI,"so, who, in some cases, are “quite certain” that the fact of their"
1557,VI,being Irish was the reason why he regarded them and their work as
1558,VI,"writers with friendship. He did, indeed, like all manner of Irish. He"
1559,VI,"liked the Irish fairies, he liked Lady Gregory, he liked most decidedly"
1560,VI,"the poor Irish people who went to the Catholic church, and (as he later"
1561,VI,"showed), of all soldiers, Irish soldiers he liked best."
1562,VI,
1563,VI,Romantic Ireland is not old;
1564,VI,"For years untold her youth will shine,"
1565,VI,"Her heart is fed on Heavenly bread,"
1566,VI,The blood of martyrs is her wine.
1567,VI,
1568,VI,Everything chivalrous and sacrificial appealing to his deepest
1569,VI,"instincts, he felt noble “delight in hopes that were vain.” It is not"
1570,VI,at all improbable that had he been an Irishman born and resident in
1571,VI,Ireland he would have been among the martyrs of Easter Week. In certain
1572,VI,qualities of his soul a kinship with these spirits may readily be
1573,VI,"traced. Some of them, I have been told, he knew personally; and his"
1574,VI,reverence for Plunkett he has written.
1575,VI,
1576,VI,"There is no rope can strangle song,"
1577,VI,And not for long death takes his toll;
1578,VI,"No prison bars can dim the stars,"
1579,VI,Nor quicklime eat the living soul.
1580,VI,
1581,VI,"And all that Kilmer wrote, every line of it, he wrote in two ways; he"
1582,VI,"wrote it in words, and he wrote it in his acts. When the idea of the"
1583,VI,Poets’ Meeting to express the sympathy of American poets with the three
1584,VI,"Irish martyred poets of Easter Week, Pearse, MacDonough and Plunkett,"
1585,VI,"first occurred to Eleanor Rogers Cox, she asked Kilmer’s advice about"
1586,VI,"it over the telephone. And he said, “Go ahead, I’ll back you up,” with"
1587,VI,"the result that the meeting, a success, took place in Central Park,"
1588,VI,"with Edwin Markham presiding, Kilmer, Margaret Widdemer, Miss Cox,"
1589,VI,"Louis Untermeyer, and many other representative poets taking part."
1590,VI,
1591,VI,When you say of the making of ballads and songs that it is a woman’s
1592,VI,"work,"
1593,VI,You forget all the fighting poets that have been in every land.
1594,VI,"There was Byron, who left all his lady-loves, to fight against the Turk,"
1595,VI,"And David, the singing king of the Jews, who was born with a sword in his"
1596,VI,hand.
1597,VI,"It was yesterday that Rupert Brooke went out to the Wars and died,"
1598,VI,And Sir Philip Sidney’s lyric voice was as sweet as his arm was strong;
1599,VI,"And Sir Walter Raleigh met the axe as a lover meets his bride,"
1600,VI,Because he carried in his soul the courage of his song.
1601,VI,
1602,VI,"Indeed, in the logical scheme of things (or, at any rate, in Joyce"
1603,VI,"Kilmer’s scheme of things) the poet is a soldier, an idealist with"
1604,VI,"the courage of his song; and, in a manner of speaking, all soldiers"
1605,VI,"are poets, whether or not they ever pen a line, for they give supreme"
1606,VI,"expression to the conviction of their soul. And then, as Christopher"
1607,VI,"Morley has finely written in his tribute to Kilmer, “the poet must go"
1608,VI,where the greatest songs are singing.” To anyone who knew Kilmer it
1609,VI,"would have been perfectly dumfounding if, when war was declared between"
1610,VI,"his country and Germany, he had _not_ done exactly as he did. It is"
1611,VI,"inconceivable--to picture him moving about here, from restaurant to"
1612,VI,"office, in this hour. Flatly, the thing can’t be done. With him, when"
1613,VI,"he joined the army, it was only one fight more, the best, and as it"
1614,VI,"proved, the last."
1615,VI,
1616,VI,"He hated many things, but I believe that of all things he hated most"
1617,VI,a pacifist--a pacifist in anything. He was a fighter. He fought for
1618,VI,"his home, stone by stone; he fought for his renown. His conception of"
1619,VI,the church was the Church Militant. His thoughts dwelt continually on
1620,VI,warrior-saints. He believed in the nobility of war and the warrior’s
1621,VI,"calling, so long as the cause was holy, or believed to be holy. As he"
1622,VI,"saw it, there was no question as to his duty. This I know, you might"
1623,VI,"as well have asked Niagara Falls why it pours over its ledge, as have"
1624,VI,"discussed with Kilmer the matter of his going to war. That was, in"
1625,VI,"its way, just such another force of nature. As to what might happen"
1626,VI,"to him, it is hardly necessary to remark that his faith told him that"
1627,VI,"that would be all right, too. John Bunker was among the last to bid him"
1628,VI,farewell. There is the Kilmerian splendour in what he wrote:
1629,VI,
1630,VI,"You didn’t pose, self-conscious of your lot,"
1631,VI,Or speak of what might be or might have been;
1632,VI,"You always thought heroics simply rot,"
1633,VI,And so you merely wore your old-time grin.
1634,VI,
1635,VI,Kilmer had first joined the Officers’ Reserve Training corps. He soon
1636,VI,resigned from this. In less than three weeks after the United States
1637,VI,"entered the war he enlisted as a private in the Seventh Regiment,"
1638,VI,"National Guard, New York. His own statement was: “I haven’t time for"
1639,VI,"Plattsburg: had too much work to finish, but I had to get in.” The"
1640,VI,"Regiment was mustered into the Federal Service on July 15, 1917; and"
1641,VI,Kilmer expected to go to training camp somewhere in the South for a
1642,VI,"couple of months, then to be sent to “France, or Russia, or Cuba, or"
1643,VI,"Mexico or somewhere else.” He had a great distaste for going to Russia,"
1644,VI,because he disliked cold climates. He one time expressed a decided
1645,VI,aversion to a book commonly held to be quite good. When asked what
1646,VI,"was the matter with it, he denounced it as being about “one of those"
1647,VI,"cold countries.” It would not, of course, have been Kilmer had he not"
1648,VI,found elation in the distinguished and picturesque character of the
1649,VI,crack regiment to which he belonged. “We are the oldest outfit in the
1650,VI,Guard--Lafayette reviewed us in 1824 and Joffre two weeks ago.” If you
1651,VI,had not seen the dress uniform of “the Seventh” you heard all about it
1652,VI,"at lunch. And “hard newspaper man” as he was, he became even “harder”"
1653,VI,"now. “Can’t hurt my feelings,” he wrote requesting a friend to be"
1654,VI,"quite frank with him. “Hard military character, seriously considering"
1655,VI,acquisition of habit of chewing tobacco.”
1656,VI,
1657,VI,"Shortly before the Seventh left New York for Spartanburg, South"
1658,VI,"Carolina, Kilmer was transferred, at his own request, to the 165th"
1659,VI,"Infantry, U. S. A., formerly the famous old “Fighting Sixty-ninth,”"
1660,VI,"New York, a unit of the Rainbow Division, assembled at Camp Mills,"
1661,VI,"Mineola, Long Island. He was most particular to impress upon his"
1662,VI,friends the point that he had been transferred at his own volition. I
1663,VI,"do not know that he ever said so, in so many words, but I gathered from"
1664,VI,him the impression that a considerable part of his motive in having
1665,VI,himself transferred was occasioned by his belief that the 165th would
1666,VI,"go sooner than the Seventh to the battlefield. Then, too, as we know,"
1667,VI,he was “half Irish”; and an Irish-American regiment doubtless was a
1668,VI,powerful magnet to him. In the 165th the people he liked best of all
1669,VI,"were “the wild Irish boys who left Ireland a few years ago, some of"
1670,VI,"them to escape threatened conscription, and travelled about the country"
1671,VI,"in gangs, generally working on the railroads. They have delightful"
1672,VI,"songs that have never been written down, but sung in vagabonds’ camps"
1673,VI,and country jails. I have got some of the songs down and hope to get
1674,VI,more--‘The Boston Burglar’--‘Sitting in My Cell All Alone’--they are a
1675,VI,"fine, a veritable Irish-American folk-lore.”"
1676,VI,
1677,VI,"Kilmer at this time was the father of four children, named"
1678,VI,"respectively Kenton Sinclair, Rose, Deborah Clanton and Michael Barry."
1679,VI,One day he appeared in my office on an errand of business relating
1680,VI,"to the handling of his literary property. He was, in outward effect,"
1681,VI,"perfectly composed, an admirable picture of a young soldier. It was"
1682,VI,"then, in what followed, that he displayed the most extraordinary, the"
1683,VI,"most amazing, measure of spiritual stature that I ever observed in any"
1684,VI,"man or ever read of in any human book. Settled, with his customary air,"
1685,VI,"in my chair, he demanded some pipe tobacco. I had none. And for this"
1686,VI,"he heartily damned me out. Then he said: “Bob, my affairs are somewhat"
1687,VI,"in disarray.” Thinking that perhaps he wanted to borrow two dollars,"
1688,VI,"or something like that, I asked: “What’s the matter, Joyce?” “Well,”"
1689,VI,"he answered, quite in his ordinary way, “several days ago Rose died;"
1690,VI,"yesterday my son, Christopher, was born; Kenton is with my wife at her"
1691,VI,"mother’s; my family is, in fact, very much scattered; I’m expecting to"
1692,VI,go to France within a few days--and I have many other difficulties.”
1693,VI,That was all he said as to this. He then talked excellent business. I
1694,VI,went to the elevator with him. We shook hands more quietly than usual;
1695,VI,"he said, “Good-bye, Bob;” and the door of the car closed upon him,"
1696,VI,"standing erect in his military overcoat, looking somewhat serious."
1697,VI,That was all.
1698,VI,
1699,VI,"From Company H. Kilmer was transferred, within a short time, to"
1700,VI,"Headquarters Company, and exchanged his eight hours a day of violent"
1701,VI,"physical exercise (“most deadening to the brain, a useful anodyne for"
1702,VI,"one, coming as it did after my grief,” he wrote in an intimate letter)"
1703,VI,for exacting but “interesting” statistical work. Though called Senior
1704,VI,Regimental Statistician he continued to rank as a private. His work
1705,VI,"was under the direction of the Regimental Chaplain, Father Francis"
1706,VI,"Patrick Duffy. He was thankful, he wrote from Mineola in a letter at"
1707,VI,"this time, that he was not with the Seventh at Spartanburg, as from"
1708,VI,"Mineola he could telephone to his wife every night, and he said: “I’ll"
1709,VI,be an accomplished cuss when I get back from the wars--I’ll know how to
1710,VI,typewrite and to serve Mass and to sing the ‘Boston Burglar.’”
1711,VI,
1712,VI,
1713,VII,VII
1714,VII,
1715,VII,"It was “the pleasantest war he had ever attended,” so he wrote back"
1716,VII,"from France. “Nice war, nice people, nice country, nice everything,”"
1717,VII,he said on the back of a postcard. To the Reverend James J. Daly he
1718,VII,"wrote, “When I next visit Campion, I’ll teach you (in addition to ‘The"
1719,VII,Boston Burglar’) an admirable song called ‘Down in the Heart of the
1720,VII,"Gas-House District.’ I sing it beautifully.” And “as a common soldier,"
1721,VII,I have the privilege of intimacy with the French peasants--and I find
1722,VII,"them edifyingly good Catholics.” But his pleasures in war he has told,"
1723,VII,"as none but the author of “Trees” and “Main Street” could tell them, in"
1724,VII,his letters. What he never told must be read between the lines. When
1725,VII,"the war was over, he said, he never wanted again to go far away from"
1726,VII,Browne’s Chop House and Shanley’s Bar. Though it is firmly held in the
1727,VII,"background, there is in all that he wrote from France, it seems to me,"
1728,VII,"a reflection that his life was, so to say, somewhat in disarray. And"
1729,VII,"clearly enough, though proudly, too, in the few poems that he sent back"
1730,VII,he spoke his body’s pain:
1731,VII,
1732,VII,"Upon his will he binds a radiant chain,"
1733,VII,For Freedom’s sake he is no longer free.
1734,VII,"It is his task, the slave of liberty,"
1735,VII,With his own blood to wipe away a stain.
1736,VII,"That pain may cease, he yields his flesh to pain,"
1737,VII,"To banish war, he must a warrior be;"
1738,VII,"He dwells in Night, eternal Dawn to see,"
1739,VII,"And gladly dies, abundant life to gain."
1740,VII,
1741,VII,And:
1742,VII,
1743,VII,My shoulders ache beneath my pack
1744,VII,"(Lie easier, Cross, upon His back)."
1745,VII,
1746,VII,I march with feet that burn and smart
1747,VII,"(Tread, Holy feet, upon my heart)."
1748,VII,
1749,VII,Men shout at me who may not speak
1750,VII,(They scourged Thy back and smote Thy cheek).
1751,VII,
1752,VII,I may not lift a hand to clear
1753,VII,My eyes of salty drops that sear.
1754,VII,
1755,VII,(Then shall my fickle soul forget
1756,VII,Thy Agony of Bloody Sweat?)
1757,VII,
1758,VII,My rifle hand is stiff and numb
1759,VII,(From Thy pierced palm red rivers come).
1760,VII,
1761,VII,"And in the closing lines of this poem certainly is given, as fully as"
1762,VII,"anything can be told in this world, the answer to the question, How did"
1763,VII,the war most affect Joyce Kilmer?--
1764,VII,
1765,VII,"Lord, Thou didst suffer more for me"
1766,VII,Than all the hosts of land and sea.
1767,VII,
1768,VII,So let me render back again
1769,VII,This millionth of Thy gift. Amen.
1770,VII,
1771,VII,"Though he said, “I have very little chance to read contemporary poetry"
1772,VII,"out here,” he did read, as he says, “what do you suppose? The ‘Oxford"
1773,VII,Book of English Verse.’” And he hoped that contemporary poetry was
1774,VII,
1775,VII,reflecting the virtues which are blossoming on the blood-soaked
1776,VII,"soil of this land--courage, and self-abnegation, and love, and"
1777,VII,"faith--this last not faith in some abstract goodness, but faith"
1778,VII,which God Himself founded and still rules. France has turned
1779,VII,to her ancient faith with more passionate devotion than she
1780,VII,has shown for centuries. I believe that America is learning
1781,VII,"the same lesson from war, and is cleansing herself of cynicism"
1782,VII,and pessimism and materialism and the lust for novelty which
1783,VII,has hampered our national development. I hope that our poets
1784,VII,already see this tendency and rejoice in it--if they do not
1785,VII,they are unworthy of their craft.
1786,VII,
1787,VII,“Just what effect the war would have had on Kilmer had he been spared
1788,VII,"is of course an entirely elusive topic,” has said one very able and"
1789,VII,"on the whole most valuable commentator, speaking from the testimony"
1790,VII,"then in hand, and voicing, I fancy, an idea still rather general. It"
1791,VII,"is not now, I think, an elusive topic at all, but a matter as plain"
1792,VII,"as a pikestaff. And the matter is, by the way, the second of the two"
1793,VII,most indispensable pages in Kilmer’s story. It is a page in which his
1794,VII,character underwent another metamorphosis as consequential in its
1795,VII,"effect on his talent even, if that could be possible, as his conversion"
1796,VII,to the Catholic faith.
1797,VII,
1798,VII,Kilmer left the United States a professional writer from his
1799,VII,"twenty-third year, and one of the most accomplished, prolific and"
1800,VII,industrious journalists of his day. Writing with him had become a habit
1801,VII,almost as natural as speech. It was his intention when he left New York
1802,VII,to write a war book. He discussed this project with his publishers even
1803,VII,so definitely as to have settled upon a title: “Here and There With the
1804,VII,Fighting Sixty-Ninth.” As time passed it became puzzling why no “copy”
1805,VII,of any kind came from him. And as still more time passed this matter
1806,VII,assumed for me an element of more than considerable mystery. It was
1807,VII,incomprehensible because none of the reasons which would ordinarily
1808,VII,apply in such a situation explained Kilmer’s case to me. If it had
1809,VII,been anyone else I should have concluded that he was unable to find
1810,VII,time to write anything. But precisely the point about Kilmer was that
1811,VII,"he did the impossible: it was quite his habit to, in the racy phrase,"
1812,VII,“get away with” situations which would have floored anyone else. It
1813,VII,was to my mind an illogical hypothesis that he could be frustrated
1814,VII,"by obstacles. And I felt that, inexplicable as it was for Kilmer to"
1815,VII,"fail in anything or to neglect any opportunity, he was here failing in"
1816,VII,justice to his career. How was it in fact? As it had always been. He
1817,VII,"was receiving the light opened to him. There could not be, I submit,"
1818,VII,"any more telling proof that he had genius, the capacity to become an"
1819,VII,"absolutely great writer, than this: that in this war which has prompted"
1820,VII,"more people to write, and has produced more “copy” than nearly all the"
1821,VII,"other events of history put together, he ceased altogether to be a"
1822,VII,"journalist of any kind; that is, even the instinct of the journalist"
1823,VII,"dropped from him, when he touched it."
1824,VII,
1825,VII,"He had had no thought, he says, of attempting to report the war:"
1826,VII,"“If I had, I’d have come over as a correspondent instead of as a"
1827,VII,soldier.” All his days he had been trying to get closer and closer
1828,VII,to the heart of life. In the war his profound instinct for humanity
1829,VII,found fulfilment. Of his close comrades he writes: “Say a prayer for
1830,VII,"them all, they’re brave men and good, and splendid company. Danger"
1831,VII,shared together and hardships mutually borne develops in us a sort
1832,VII,"of friendship I never knew in civilian life, a friendship clean of"
1833,VII,"jealousy and gossip and envy and suspicion--a fine, hearty, roaring,"
1834,VII,"mirthful sort of thing, like an open fire of whole pine-trees in a"
1835,VII,giant’s castle.”
1836,VII,
1837,VII,"He was at present “a poet trying to be a soldier.” “To tell the truth,"
1838,VII,"I am not at all interested in writing nowadays, except in so far as"
1839,VII,writing is the expression of something beautiful. And I see daily and
1840,VII,"nightly the expression of beauty in action instead of words, and I find"
1841,VII,it more satisfactory.”
1842,VII,
1843,VII,"“My days of hack writing are over, for a time at least.” Upon his"
1844,VII,return to civilian life his civilian work “may be straight reporting.”
1845,VII,As for “that mob of war writers (thank God--let me pharisaically
1846,VII,say--that I am not one of them).” The book? “The only sort of book I
1847,VII,care to write about the war is the sort people will read after the war
1848,VII,is over--a century after it is over!”
1849,VII,
1850,VII,"Kilmer’s “Holy Ireland,” a sketch of a lodging for the night enjoyed by"
1851,VII,"a little group of Irish-American soldiers at a farmhouse in France, is"
1852,VII,the only piece of prose writing of any extent at all that came from him
1853,VII,overseas. He himself wrote of it to his publishers: “I sent you a prose
1854,VII,"sketch ‘Holy Ireland,’ which represents the best prose writing I can do"
1855,VII,"nowadays.” It is unmistakably a piece of literature, that is to say,"
1856,VII,"though slight enough in substance, a work of firm and exquisite and"
1857,VII,enduring art.
1858,VII,
1859,VII,"In a letter to the Reverend Edward F. Garesché, S.J., one of the last"
1860,VII,"he wrote, the following paragraphs occur:"
1861,VII,
1862,VII,I have written very little--two prose sketches and two
1863,VII,"poems--since I left the States, but I have a rich store of"
1864,VII,"memories. Not that what I write matters--I have discovered,"
1865,VII,"since some unforgettable experiences, that writing is not the"
1866,VII,tremendously important thing I once considered it. You will
1867,VII,"find me less a bookman when you next see me, and more, I hope,"
1868,VII,a man.
1869,VII,
1870,VII,"And he ends with these words: “Pray for me, my dear Father, that I may"
1871,VII,love God more and that I may be unceasingly conscious of Him--that is
1872,VII,the greatest desire I have.”
1873,VII,
1874,VII,"Though he gloried in being a private soldier, it is quite evident, too,"
1875,VII,"that he was charmed with his promotion. “I am now a sergeant,” appears"
1876,VII,"on the back of every copy of the well-known “tin-hat” post-card, and"
1877,VII,in every letter near this date. In more than one intimate letter he
1878,VII,says: “I’ll never be anything higher. To get a commission I’d have to
1879,VII,"go away for three months to school, and then whether or not I was made"
1880,VII,"an officer--I’d be sent to some outfit other than this, and I don’t"
1881,VII,want to leave this crowd. I’d rather be a sergeant in the 69th than a
1882,VII,"lieutenant in any other regiment in the world.” “A volunteer regiment,"
1883,VII,the bravest and best regiment in the army.” “I have a new stripe--an
1884,VII,inverted chevron of bright gold on the left cuff for six months’
1885,VII,"service ... let my children be proud of it.” And, “a long moustache I"
1886,VII,have.”
1887,VII,
1888,VII,"For a while he had worked in the Adjutant’s Office, having special"
1889,VII,charge of recording and reporting statistics. Then he was no longer
1890,VII,(“thank God!”) doing statistics. Someone over here had said that he
1891,VII,"had “a bullet-proof job.” “I had one, but succeeded, after two months"
1892,VII,"intriguing, in getting rid of it.” “At that time I was just an office"
1893,VII,"hack--now I am a soldier, in the most fascinating branch of the service"
1894,VII,"there is--sheer romance, night and day--especially night.” He had"
1895,VII,"become attached to the Regimental Intelligence Section, working as"
1896,VII,"an observer--“very amusing work,” “wonderful life!”--“the finest job"
1897,VII,in the army!” But “I don’t know what I’ll be able to do in civilian
1898,VII,"life--unless I become a fireman!” “I am having a delightful time, but"
1899,VII,it won’t break my heart for the war to end.”
1900,VII,
1901,VII,“Rouge Bouquet” was his “first attempt at versification in a dug-out.”
1902,VII,"He had lived in “billets, dug-outs, trenches, observatories and all"
1903,VII,"sorts of queer places.” And at length, he was “(after a most violent"
1904,VII,and amusing month) resting (six hours out of every twenty-four!) in a
1905,VII,"beautiful place, among the firs and pines on a lovely mountain top,"
1906,VII,from which I can see strange things.” “I sleep on a couch made soft
1907,VII,"with deftly laid young spruce boughs and eat at a table set under good,"
1908,VII,"kind trees.” And with that inimitable, irrepressible and incomparable"
1909,VII,Kilmerian pleasure he contemplated what he called “my senility”:
1910,VII,
1911,VII,"I picture myself at sixty, with a long white moustache, a pale"
1912,VII,"gray tweed suit, a very large panama hat, I can see my gnarled"
1913,VII,but beautifully groomed hands as they tremblingly pour out the
1914,VII,glass of dry sherry which belongs to every old man’s breakfast.
1915,VII,I cannot think of myself at seventy or eighty--I grow
1916,VII,hysterical with applause--I am lost in a delirium of massive
1917,VII,"ebony canes, golden snuff-boxes, and dainty silk hats."
1918,VII,
1919,VII,"“When we first met over here,” wrote Kilmer’s friend Charles L."
1920,VII,"O’Donnell, Chaplain 332d Infantry, in a letter to Thomas Walsh which"
1921,VII,"should be written into the record, “he was in the personnel department"
1922,VII,"of his regiment, having had his time of service in the field and done"
1923,VII,some particularly good work in the intelligence line. He was then about
1924,VII,to go into the intelligence permanently and so avid of it was he as
1925,VII,to be ready to relinquish his hard-earned sergeant’s chevrons. In the
1926,VII,"event, however, that sacrifice was not demanded. After this change in"
1927,VII,"his work he was much more agreeably placed, in particular he had more"
1928,VII,freedom and more time to see his friends. He was worshipped by the men
1929,VII,about him. I have heard them speak with awe of his coolness and his
1930,VII,nerve in scouting patrols in No Man’s Land. As an intelligence man he
1931,VII,made personally a few very valuable discoveries: this was when I was
1932,VII,with him in our comparatively quiet sector. I can only conceive that he
1933,VII,distinguished himself later in the larger opportunities that came his
1934,VII,way.” The letter continues:
1935,VII,
1936,VII,We were both in the army but he was also of it. I was amazed
1937,VII,to find him so quickly become a soldier with the soldier’s
1938,VII,"point of view. But he had seen so much more than I, even then,"
1939,VII,and each day in this war is equivalent to long campaigns of
1940,VII,"other times. I felt, and was a rookie beside him. He had got"
1941,VII,a perspective on his life at home that made him smile with
1942,VII,indulgent pity on some literary aspects of it. I spoke of what
1943,VII,"must have been his earlier views, the good he was doing and the"
1944,VII,need of doing it. But he was not ready to relinquish a position
1945,VII,"he had bought at the price of suffering, cold, hunger, fatigue,"
1946,VII,with the hourly self denials that military discipline means.
1947,VII,"Not that he spoke of these things in this way, but I knew they"
1948,VII,had gone into the creation of his new stand and I knew in my
1949,VII,heart it was higher ground.
1950,VII,
1951,VII,"A closer witness is Sergeant-Major Lemist Esler, who served side by"
1952,VII,side with Kilmer in the Marne advance. Shortly afterward returned to
1953,VII,"the United States for service as an instructor at an army cantonment,"
1954,VII,he said in an interview in the _New York Times_: “The front was his
1955,VII,goal and no sooner had the regiment reached France than he made every
1956,VII,possible effort to be transferred.”
1957,VII,
1958,VII,He finally had himself moved to the Intelligence Department.
1959,VII,It was in that department that he was elevated to the rank of
1960,VII,Sergeant. I was supply sergeant at the time and Joyce Kilmer
1961,VII,was a perfect trial to me. He would always be doing more than
1962,VII,"his orders called for--that is, getting much nearer to the"
1963,VII,enemy’s positions than any officer would ever be inclined to
1964,VII,"send him. Night after night he would lie out in No Man’s Land,"
1965,VII,"crawling through barbed wires, in an effort to locate enemy"
1966,VII,"positions, and enemy guns, and tearing his clothes to shreds."
1967,VII,On the following day he would come to me for a new uniform.
1968,VII,
1969,VII,“There was something of what the Scots call ‘fey’ about him as a
1970,VII,"soldier,” is the testimony of the chaplain of the 165th Infantry,"
1971,VII,Father Duffy. “He was absolutely the coolest and most indifferent man
1972,VII,in the face of danger I have ever seen. It was not for lack of love of
1973,VII,"life, for he enjoyed his life as a soldier--his only cross was distance"
1974,VII,from home. It was partly from his inborn courage and devotion--he would
1975,VII,not stint his sacrifice--partly his deep and real belief that what God
1976,VII,wills is best.”
1977,VII,
1978,VII,"Once Marshal Foch’s advance began, Kilmer seems to have been constantly"
1979,VII,in the thick of the fighting. In the _New York Evening Sun_ of August
1980,VII,"8 a correspondent told how a party composed of Major Donovan, Joyce"
1981,VII,Kilmer and John Kayes advanced to the edge of a wood and captured a
1982,VII,German dressed in an American uniform.
1983,VII,
1984,VII,“Joyce was one of those soldiers who had a romantic love of death in
1985,VII,"battle,” Father Duffy has added, “and it could not have missed him"
1986,VII,"in time.” No, the stars move in their appointed courses; and there"
1987,VII,are certain things written aforetime. While he had life there was a
1988,VII,defiant hope among us who knew his great gift for triumph that somehow
1989,VII,"this would see him through, that even over the inevitable he would"
1990,VII,prevail. But Destiny would not have been her immemorial self had she
1991,VII,"stayed her tragic hand from this shining figure, type and symbol in his"
1992,VII,"taking of her unscrutable ways with man. And, somehow, in his death his"
1993,VII,"life was all of a piece, and one cannot but admire the poetic justice"
1994,VII,of his end.
1995,VII,
1996,VII,Never fear but in the skies
1997,VII,Saints and angels stand

2005,VII,
2006,VII,"Sergeant Kilmer was killed in action near the Ourcq, July 30, 1918."
2007,VII,"“He had,” runs the report in _The Stars and Stripes_, the newspaper"
2008,VII,"of the American Expeditionary Force, “volunteered his services to the"
2009,VII,major of the foremost battalion because his own battalion would not be
2010,VII,in the lead that day.” From the report of Sergeant Esler and a letter
2011,VII,(printed in the _New York Times_) to a friend in New York by Alexander
2012,VII,"Woollcott, dramatic critic of the _Times_ before his service abroad,"
2013,VII,the facts are established.
2014,VII,
2015,VII,"At the dawn of a misty Sunday, July 28, the 165th had made a gallant"
2016,VII,and irresistible charge across the river and up the hill. In the height
2017,VII,of the great five days battle for the mastery of the heights which
2018,VII,followed Kilmer was killed. It so happened that he was close to the
2019,VII,"Major when the battalion adjutant fell and, in the emergency of the"
2020,VII,"battle, without commission or appointment, he was serving as a sort"
2021,VII,of aid to the battalion commander. Discovering that the woods ahead
2022,VII,"harboured some machine guns, he had reported this fact, and was sent in"
2023,VII,the lead of a patrol to establish their exact location. When a couple
2024,VII,of hours later the battalion advanced into the woods to clear the spot
2025,VII,"of the enemy, several of Kilmer’s comrades caught sight of him lying,"
2026,VII,"as if still scouting, with his eyes bent over a little ridge. So like"
2027,VII,"his living self he was, they called to him, then ran up--to find him"
2028,VII,"dead with a bullet through his brain. He lies buried, we read, beside"
2029,VII,Lieutenant Oliver Ames at the edge of a little copse that is known as
2030,VII,"the Wood of the Burned Bridge, so close to the purling Ourcq that,"
2031,VII,"standing by the graveside, one could throw a pebble into its waters."
2032,VII,Perhaps ten minutes walk to the north lies the half obliterated
2033,VII,"village Seringes, captured by American troops the night before Kilmer"
2034,VII,"was killed. Eloquent of affection in the making of it, the grave is of"
2035,VII,"course, marked by a wooden cross, on which is written, “Sergeant Joyce"
2036,VII,"Kilmer.” Then, after the inscription of his company and regiment, is"
2037,VII,"the line: “Killed in Action--July 30, 1918.”"
2038,VII,
2039,VII,"It is not a rule to bury enlisted men with officers, but Kilmer had won"
2040,VII,so much admiration and respect not only from the enlisted men in his
2041,VII,"company but also from the officers, that the commander of the regiment"
2042,VII,authorised that his grave be dug on the spot and that he be buried next
2043,VII,to the grave of the heroic Lieutenant who had just lost his life.
2044,VII,
2045,VII,Sergeant Woollcott was with the regiment in the woods the day they
2046,VII,"came out of the line to catch their breaths, and the news of Kilmer’s"
2047,VII,"death, he says, “greeted me on every turn. The Captain under whom he"
2048,VII,"had been serving for several months, the Major at whose side he fell,"
2049,VII,"stray cooks, doughboys, runners--all shook their heads sorrowfully and"
2050,VII,talked among themselves of what a good soldier he had been and what an
2051,VII,infinite pity it was that the bullet had had to single him out. And
2052,VII,"in such days as these, there are no platitudes of polite regret. When"
2053,VII,"men, good men and close pals, are falling about you by hundreds, when"
2054,VII,every man in the regiment has come out of the fight the poorer for the
2055,VII,"loss of not one but many friends, there is no time to say pretty things"
2056,VII,about a man just because he exists no longer. Death is too common to
2057,VII,distinguish anyone. So the glowing praise and admiration I heard for
2058,VII,Joyce was real--every word of it.”
2059,VII,
2060,VII,"It is, I think, fitting to preserve in a form more durable than its"
2061,VII,newspaper publication more of this letter. It continues:
2062,VII,
2063,VII,I gathered that his stock among men of all ranks had been
2064,VII,"climbing steadily from the first days when many of them,"
2065,VII,"including myself, felt that he was out of his own element in a"
2066,VII,"rip-roaring regiment. As the regiment’s laureate, they all knew"
2067,VII,"him and they knew, too, that he was at work on a history of the"
2068,VII,"regiment. He had become quite an institution, with his arms"
2069,VII,"full of maps as they used to be full of minor poetry, and his"
2070,VII,mouth full of that imperishable pipe.
2071,VII,
2072,VII,They all knew his verse. I found any number of men who had
2073,VII,only to fish around in their tattered blouses to bring out the
2074,VII,copy of a poem Kilmer wrote in memory of some of their number
2075,VII,who were killed by a shell in March. You see that there is a
2076,VII,"refrain which calls for bugle notes, and I am told that at"
2077,VII,"the funeral services, where the lines were first read, the"
2078,VII,desperately sad notes of “Taps” sounded faintly from a distant
2079,VII,grave when the refrain invoked them. The lines were read by
2080,VII,"Joyce’s own beloved Father Duffy, and those who were there"
2081,VII,told me the tears streamed down the face of every boy in the
2082,VII,regiment. They just blubbered.
2083,VII,
2084,VII,
2085,VIII,VIII
2086,VIII,
2087,VIII,"Indeed, such was the power of his spirit over other men that even now"
2088,VIII,"he has become a legend, his excellence a popular heritage, benefiting"
2089,VIII,and enriching human life. Writing with the pen of all those who knew
2090,VIII,"him in his overcoat of glory and debonair hat, his friend Charles"
2091,VIII,Willis Thompson says: “I had a great affection and a deep admiration
2092,VIII,"and respect for him, different from that which I had for anybody else I"
2093,VIII,"knew.” And expressing, I think, the heart of innumerable ones who did"
2094,VIII,"not chance his way, Booth Tarkington says: “But I had a sense of him"
2095,VIII,as of something fine and of fine promise. I haven’t read much that he
2096,VIII,wrote; but it was like knowing that there was a good picture somewhere
2097,VIII,"in a gallery that I hadn’t visited, but might, some day.”"
2098,VIII,
2099,VIII,The full beauty of his life is known only to God. As religion was the
2100,VIII,first thing in his life let it be the last thing said of him. In one
2101,VIII,"of his last letters, he wrote to Sister M. Emerentia of St. Joseph’s"
2102,VIII,"College, Toronto, Ontario: “Pray that I may love God more. It seems to"
2103,VIII,"me that if I can learn to love God more passionately, more constantly,"
2104,VIII,"without distractions, that absolutely nothing else can matter. Except"
2105,VIII,"while we are in the trenches I receive Holy Communion every morning,"
2106,VIII,so it ought to be all the easier for me to attain this object of my
2107,VIII,"prayers. I got Faith, you know, by praying for it. I hope to get Love"
2108,VIII,the same way.”

2335,MAIN STREET,
2336,MAIN STREET,
2337,MAIN STREET,"I like to look at the blossomy track of the moon upon the sea,"
2338,MAIN STREET,But it isn’t half so fine a sight as Main Street used to be
2339,MAIN STREET,"When it all was covered over with a couple of feet of snow,"
2340,MAIN STREET,And over the crisp and radiant road the ringing sleighs would go.
2341,MAIN STREET,
2342,MAIN STREET,"Now, Main Street bordered with autumn leaves, it was a pleasant thing,"
2343,MAIN STREET,And its gutters were gay with dandelions early in the Spring;
2344,MAIN STREET,"I like to think of it white with frost or dusty in the heat,"
2345,MAIN STREET,Because I think it is humaner than any other street.
2346,MAIN STREET,
2347,MAIN STREET,"A city street that is busy and wide is ground by a thousand wheels,"
2348,MAIN STREET,And a burden of traffic on its breast is all it ever feels:
2349,MAIN STREET,"It is dully conscious of weight and speed and of work that never ends,"
2350,MAIN STREET,"But it cannot be human like Main Street, and recognise its friends."
2351,MAIN STREET,
2352,MAIN STREET,"There were only about a hundred teams on Main Street in a day,"
2353,MAIN STREET,"And twenty or thirty people, I guess, and some children out to play."
2354,MAIN STREET,"And there wasn’t a wagon or buggy, or a man or a girl or a boy"
2355,MAIN STREET,"That Main Street didn’t remember, and somehow seem to enjoy."
2356,MAIN STREET,
2357,MAIN STREET,The truck and the motor and trolley car and the elevated train
2358,MAIN STREET,They make the weary city street reverberate with pain:
2359,MAIN STREET,But there is yet an echo left deep down within my heart
2360,MAIN STREET,Of the music the Main Street cobblestones made beneath a butcher’s cart.
2361,MAIN STREET,
2362,MAIN STREET,"God be thanked for the Milky Way that runs across the sky,"
2363,MAIN STREET,That’s the path that my feet would tread whenever I have to die.
2364,MAIN STREET,"Some folks call it a Silver Sword, and some a Pearly Crown,"
2365,MAIN STREET,"But the only thing I think it is, is Main Street, Heaventown."

2373,ROOFS,
2374,ROOFS,
2375,ROOFS,The road is wide and the stars are out and the breath of the night is
2376,ROOFS,"sweet,"
2377,ROOFS,And this is the time when wanderlust should seize upon my feet.
2378,ROOFS,"But I’m glad to turn from the open road and the starlight on my face,"
2379,ROOFS,And to leave the splendour of out-of-doors for a human dwelling place.
2380,ROOFS,
2381,ROOFS,I never have seen a vagabond who really liked to roam
2382,ROOFS,All up and down the streets of the world and not to have a home:
2383,ROOFS,The tramp who slept in your barn last night and left at break of day
2384,ROOFS,Will wander only until he finds another place to stay.
2385,ROOFS,
2386,ROOFS,A gypsy-man will sleep in his cart with canvas overhead;
2387,ROOFS,Or else he’ll go into his tent when it is time for bed.
2388,ROOFS,"He’ll sit on the grass and take his ease so long as the sun is high,"
2389,ROOFS,But when it is dark he wants a roof to keep away the sky.
2390,ROOFS,
2391,ROOFS,"If you call a gypsy a vagabond, I think you do him wrong,"
2392,ROOFS,For he never goes a-travelling but he takes his home along.
2393,ROOFS,"And the only reason a road is good, as every wanderer knows,"
2394,ROOFS,"Is just because of the homes, the homes, the homes to which it goes."
2395,ROOFS,
2396,ROOFS,"They say that life is a highway and its milestones are the years,"
2397,ROOFS,And now and then there’s a toll-gate where you buy your way with tears.
2398,ROOFS,"It’s a rough road and a steep road and it stretches broad and far,"
2399,ROOFS,But at last it leads to a golden Town where golden Houses are.

2407,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2408,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2409,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"The Judge’s house has a splendid porch, with pillars and steps of stone,"
2410,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,And the Judge has a lovely flowering hedge that came from across the
2411,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,seas;
2412,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"In the Hales’ garage you could put my house and everything I own,"
2413,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,And the Hales have a lawn like an emerald and a row of poplar trees.
2414,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2415,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"Now I have only a little house, and only a little lot,"
2416,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"And only a few square yards of lawn, with dandelions starred;"
2417,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"But when Winter comes, I have something there that the Judge and the"
2418,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"Hales have not,"
2419,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,And it’s better worth having than all their wealth--it’s a snowman in
2420,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,the yard.
2421,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2422,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,The Judge’s money brings architects to make his mansion fair;
2423,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,The Hales have seven gardeners to make their roses grow;
2424,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"The Judge can get his trees from Spain and France and everywhere,"
2425,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,And raise his orchids under glass in the midst of all the snow.
2426,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2427,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"But I have something no architect or gardener ever made,"
2428,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,A thing that is shaped by the busy touch of little mittened hands:
2429,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"And the Judge would give up his lonely estate, where the level snow is"
2430,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,laid
2431,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"For the tiny house with the trampled yard, the yard where the snowman"
2432,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,stands.
2433,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2434,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,They say that after Adam and Eve were driven away in tears
2435,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"To toil and suffer their life-time through, because of the sin they"
2436,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"sinned,"
2437,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"The Lord made Winter to punish them for half their exiled years,"
2438,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"To chill their blood with the snow, and pierce their flesh with the icy"
2439,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,wind.
2440,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,
2441,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"But we who inherit the primal curse, and labour for our bread,"
2442,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"Have yet, thank God, the gift of Home, though Eden’s gate is barred:"
2443,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,"And through the Winter’s crystal veil, Love’s roses blossom red,"
2444,THE SNOWMAN IN THE YARD,For him who lives in a house that has a snowman in the yard.

2457,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Now of the delightful Court of Heaven,"
2458,A BLUE VALENTINE,"I respectfully salute you,"
2459,A BLUE VALENTINE,I genuflect
2460,A BLUE VALENTINE,And I kiss your episcopal ring.
2461,A BLUE VALENTINE,
2462,A BLUE VALENTINE,"It is not, Monsignore,"
2463,A BLUE VALENTINE,"The fragrant memory of your holy life,"
2464,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Nor that of your shining and joyous martyrdom,"
2465,A BLUE VALENTINE,Which causes me now to address you.
2466,A BLUE VALENTINE,"But since this is your august festival, Monsignore,"
2467,A BLUE VALENTINE,It seems appropriate to me to state
2468,A BLUE VALENTINE,"According to a venerable and agreeable custom,"
2469,A BLUE VALENTINE,That I love a beautiful lady.
2470,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Her eyes, Monsignore,"
2471,A BLUE VALENTINE,Are so blue that they put lovely little blue reflections
2472,A BLUE VALENTINE,"On everything that she looks at,"
2473,A BLUE VALENTINE,Such as a wall
2474,A BLUE VALENTINE,Or the moon
2475,A BLUE VALENTINE,Or my heart.
2476,A BLUE VALENTINE,"It is like the light coming through blue stained glass,"
2477,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Yet not quite like it,"
2478,A BLUE VALENTINE,"For the blueness is not transparent,"
2479,A BLUE VALENTINE,Only translucent.
2480,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Her soul’s light shines through,"
2481,A BLUE VALENTINE,But her soul cannot be seen.
2482,A BLUE VALENTINE,"It is something elusive, whimsical, tender, wanton, infantile, wise"
2483,A BLUE VALENTINE,And noble.
2484,A BLUE VALENTINE,"She wears, Monsignore, a blue garment,"
2485,A BLUE VALENTINE,Made in the manner of the Japanese.
2486,A BLUE VALENTINE,It is very blue--
2487,A BLUE VALENTINE,"I think that her eyes have made it more blue,"
2488,A BLUE VALENTINE,Sweetly staining it
2489,A BLUE VALENTINE,As the pressure of her body has graciously given it form.
2490,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Loving her, Monsignore,"
2491,A BLUE VALENTINE,I love all her attributes;
2492,A BLUE VALENTINE,But I believe
2493,A BLUE VALENTINE,That even if I did not love her
2494,A BLUE VALENTINE,"I would love the blueness of her eyes,"
2495,A BLUE VALENTINE,"And her blue garment, made in the manner of the Japanese."
2496,A BLUE VALENTINE,
2497,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Monsignore,"
2498,A BLUE VALENTINE,I have never before troubled you with a request.
2499,A BLUE VALENTINE,The saints whose ears I chiefly worry with my pleas are the most
2500,A BLUE VALENTINE,"exquisite and maternal Brigid,"
2501,A BLUE VALENTINE,"Gallant Saint Stephen, who puts fire in my blood,"
2502,A BLUE VALENTINE,"And your brother bishop, my patron,"
2503,A BLUE VALENTINE,The generous and jovial Saint Nicholas of Bari.
2504,A BLUE VALENTINE,"But, of your courtesy, Monsignore,"
2505,A BLUE VALENTINE,Do me this favour:
2506,A BLUE VALENTINE,When you this morning make your way
2507,A BLUE VALENTINE,To the Ivory Throne that bursts into bloom with roses because of her who
2508,A BLUE VALENTINE,"sits upon it,"
2509,A BLUE VALENTINE,"When you come to pay your devoir to Our Lady,"
2510,A BLUE VALENTINE,"I beg you, say to her:"
2511,A BLUE VALENTINE,"“Madame, a poor poet, one of your singing servants yet on earth,"
2512,A BLUE VALENTINE,Has asked me to say that at this moment he is especially grateful to you
2513,A BLUE VALENTINE,For wearing a blue gown.”

3497,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Nor hidden reef has sent me
3498,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,The way that I must go.
3499,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"My wound that stains the waters,"
3500,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"My blood that is like flame,"
3501,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"Bear witness to a loathly deed,"
3502,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,A deed without a name.
3503,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,
3504,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"“I went not forth to battle,"
3505,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"I carried friendly men,"
3506,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"The children played about my decks,"
3507,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,The women sang--and then--
3508,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,And then--the sun blushed scarlet
3509,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"And Heaven hid its face,"
3510,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,The world that God created

3514,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,The blow that sent me here
3515,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Was aimed in Hell. My dying scream
3516,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Has reached Jehovah’s ear.
3517,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Not all the seven oceans
3518,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Shall wash away that stain;
3519,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Upon a brow that wears a crown
3520,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,I am the brand of Cain.”
3521,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,
3522,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,When God’s great voice assembles
3523,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"The fleet on Judgment Day,"
3524,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,The ghosts of ruined ships will rise
3525,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,In sea and strait and bay.
3526,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,Though they have lain for ages
3527,THE WHITE SHIPS AND THE RED,"Beneath the changeless flood,"

3536,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,(For Edward J. Wheeler)
3537,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,
3538,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,
3539,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Within the Jersey City shed
3540,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,The engine coughs and shakes its head.
3541,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"The smoke, a plume of red and white,"
3542,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Waves madly in the face of night.
3543,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And now the grave incurious stars
3544,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Gleam on the groaning hurrying cars.
3545,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Against the kind and awful reign
3546,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Of darkness, this our angry train,"
3547,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"A noisy little rebel, pouts"
3548,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Its brief defiance, flames and shouts--"
3549,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"And passes on, and leaves no trace."
3550,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"For darkness holds its ancient place,"
3551,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Serene and absolute, the king"
3552,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Unchanged, of every living thing."
3553,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,The houses lie obscure and still
3554,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,In Rutherford and Carlton Hill.
3555,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Our lamps intensify the dark
3556,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Of slumbering Passaic Park.
3557,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And quiet holds the weary feet
3558,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,That daily tramp through Prospect Street.
3559,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,What though we clang and clank and roar
3560,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Through all Passaic’s streets? No door
3561,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Will open, not an eye will see"
3562,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Who this loud vagabond may be.
3563,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Upon my crimson cushioned seat,"
3564,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"In manufactured light and heat,"
3565,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,I feel unnatural and mean.
3566,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Outside the towns are cool and clean;
3567,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Curtained awhile from sound and sight
3568,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,They take God’s gracious gift of night.
3569,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,The stars are watchful over them.
3570,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,On Clifton as on Bethlehem
3571,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"The angels, leaning down the sky,"
3572,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Shed peace and gentle dreams. And I--
3573,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"I ride, I blasphemously ride"
3574,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Through all the silent countryside.
3575,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"The engine’s shriek, the headlight’s glare,"
3576,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Pollute the still nocturnal air.
3577,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,The cottages of Lake View sigh
3578,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"And sleeping, frown as we pass by."
3579,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Why, even strident Paterson"
3580,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Rests quietly as any nun.
3581,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Her foolish warring children keep
3582,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,The grateful armistice of sleep.
3583,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,For what tremendous errand’s sake
3584,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Are we so blatantly awake?
3585,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,What precious secret is our freight?
3586,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,What king must be abroad so late?
3587,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Perhaps Death roams the hills to-night
3588,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And we rush forth to give him fight.
3589,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Or else, perhaps, we speed his way"
3590,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,To some remote unthinking prey.
3591,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Perhaps a woman writhes in pain
3592,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And listens--listens for the train!
3593,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"The train, that like an angel sings,"
3594,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"The train, with healing on its wings."
3595,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Now “Hawthorne!” the conductor cries.
3596,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,My neighbor starts and rubs his eyes.
3597,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,He hurries yawning through the car
3598,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And steps out where the houses are.
3599,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,This is the reason of our quest!
3600,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Not wantonly we break the rest
3601,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Of town and village, nor do we"
3602,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Lightly profane night’s sanctity.
3603,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"What Love commands the train fulfills,"
3604,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And beautiful upon the hills
3605,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Are these our feet of burnished steel.
3606,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Subtly and certainly I feel
3607,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,That Glen Rock welcomes us to her
3608,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,And silent Ridgewood seems to stir
3609,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"And smile, because she knows the train"
3610,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Has brought her children back again.
3611,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,We carry people home--and so
3612,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"God speeds us, wheresoe’er we go."
3613,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"Hohokus, Waldwick, Allendale"
3614,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Lift sleepy heads to give us hail.
3615,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"In Ramsey, Mahwah, Suffern stand"
3616,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,Houses that wistfully demand
3617,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,A father--son--some human thing
3618,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"That this, the midnight train, may bring."
3619,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,The trains that travel in the day
3620,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,They hurry folks to work or play.
3621,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"The midnight train is slow and old,"
3622,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"But of it let this thing be told,"
3623,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,"To its high honor be it said,"
3624,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,It carries people home to bed.
3625,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,My cottage lamp shines white and clear.
3626,THE TWELVE-FORTY-FIVE,God bless the train that brought me here.

3727,OLD POETS,"And sleep underneath a tree,"

3777,DELICATESSEN,Why is that wanton gossip Fame
3778,DELICATESSEN,So dumb about this man’s affairs?
3779,DELICATESSEN,Why do we twitter at his name
3780,DELICATESSEN,Who come to buy his curious wares?
3781,DELICATESSEN,
3782,DELICATESSEN,Here is a shop of wonderment.
3783,DELICATESSEN,From every land has come a prize;
3784,DELICATESSEN,"Rich spices from the Orient,"
3785,DELICATESSEN,"And fruit that knew Italian skies,"
3786,DELICATESSEN,
3787,DELICATESSEN,And figs that ripened by the sea
3788,DELICATESSEN,"In Smyrna, nuts from hot Brazil,"
3789,DELICATESSEN,"Strange pungent meats from Germany,"
3790,DELICATESSEN,And currants from a Grecian hill.
3791,DELICATESSEN,
3792,DELICATESSEN,He is the lord of goodly things
3793,DELICATESSEN,"That make the poor man’s table gay,"
3794,DELICATESSEN,Yet of his worth no minstrel sings
3795,DELICATESSEN,And on his tomb there is no bay.
3796,DELICATESSEN,
3797,DELICATESSEN,"Perhaps he lives and dies unpraised,"
3798,DELICATESSEN,"This trafficker in humble sweets,"
3799,DELICATESSEN,Because his little shops are raised
3800,DELICATESSEN,By thousands in the city streets.
3801,DELICATESSEN,
3802,DELICATESSEN,"Yet stars in greater numbers shine,"
3803,DELICATESSEN,"And violets in millions grow,"
3804,DELICATESSEN,And they in many a golden line
3805,DELICATESSEN,"Are sung, as every child must know."
3806,DELICATESSEN,
3807,DELICATESSEN,"Perhaps Fame thinks his worried eyes,"
3808,DELICATESSEN,"His wrinkled, shrewd, pathetic face,"
3809,DELICATESSEN,"His shop, and all he sells and buys"
3810,DELICATESSEN,Are desperately commonplace.
3811,DELICATESSEN,
3812,DELICATESSEN,"Well, it is true he has no sword"
3813,DELICATESSEN,To dangle at his booted knees.
3814,DELICATESSEN,"He leans across a slab of board,"
3815,DELICATESSEN,And draws his knife and slices cheese.
3816,DELICATESSEN,
3817,DELICATESSEN,"He never heard of chivalry,"
3818,DELICATESSEN,He longs for no heroic times;
3819,DELICATESSEN,"He thinks of pickles, olives, tea,"
3820,DELICATESSEN,"And dollars, nickels, cents and dimes."
3821,DELICATESSEN,
3822,DELICATESSEN,"His world has narrow walls, it seems;"
3823,DELICATESSEN,By counters is his soul confined;
3824,DELICATESSEN,"His wares are all his hopes and dreams,"
3825,DELICATESSEN,They are the fabric of his mind.
3826,DELICATESSEN,
3827,DELICATESSEN,Yet--in a room above the store
3828,DELICATESSEN,There is a woman--and a child
3829,DELICATESSEN,Pattered just now across the floor;
3830,DELICATESSEN,The shopman looked at him and smiled.
3831,DELICATESSEN,
3832,DELICATESSEN,"For, once he thrilled with high romance"
3833,DELICATESSEN,And turned to love his eager voice.
3834,DELICATESSEN,Like any cavalier of France
3835,DELICATESSEN,He wooed the maiden of his choice.
3836,DELICATESSEN,
3837,DELICATESSEN,And now deep in his weary heart
3838,DELICATESSEN,Are sacred flames that whitely burn.
3839,DELICATESSEN,He has of Heaven’s grace a part
3840,DELICATESSEN,"Who loves, who is beloved in turn."
3841,DELICATESSEN,
3842,DELICATESSEN,"And when the long day’s work is done,"
3843,DELICATESSEN,(How slow the leaden minutes ran!)
3844,DELICATESSEN,"Home, with his wife and little son,"
3845,DELICATESSEN,"He is no huckster, but a man!"
3846,DELICATESSEN,
3847,DELICATESSEN,"And there are those who grasp his hand,"
3848,DELICATESSEN,Who drink with him and wish him well.
3849,DELICATESSEN,O in no drear and lonely land
3850,DELICATESSEN,Shall he who honours friendship dwell.
3851,DELICATESSEN,
3852,DELICATESSEN,"And in his little shop, who knows"
3853,DELICATESSEN,What bitter games of war are played?
3854,DELICATESSEN,"Why, daily on each corner grows"
3855,DELICATESSEN,A foe to rob him of his trade.
3856,DELICATESSEN,
3857,DELICATESSEN,"He fights, and for his fireside’s sake;"
3858,DELICATESSEN,He fights for clothing and for bread:
3859,DELICATESSEN,The lances of his foemen make
3860,DELICATESSEN,A steely halo round his head.
3861,DELICATESSEN,
3862,DELICATESSEN,"He decks his window artfully,"
3863,DELICATESSEN,He haggles over paltry sums.
3864,DELICATESSEN,In this strange field his war must be
3865,DELICATESSEN,And by such blows his triumph comes.
3866,DELICATESSEN,
3867,DELICATESSEN,What if no trumpet sounds to call
3868,DELICATESSEN,His arméd legions to his side?
3869,DELICATESSEN,What if to no ancestral hall
3870,DELICATESSEN,He comes in all a victor’s pride?
3871,DELICATESSEN,
3872,DELICATESSEN,The scene shall never fit the deed.
3873,DELICATESSEN,Grotesquely wonders come to pass.
3874,DELICATESSEN,The fool shall mount an Arab steed
3875,DELICATESSEN,And Jesus ride upon an ass.
3876,DELICATESSEN,
3877,DELICATESSEN,This man has home and child and wife
3878,DELICATESSEN,And battle set for every day.
3879,DELICATESSEN,This man has God and love and life;
3880,DELICATESSEN,"These stand, all else shall pass away."

4599,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4600,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,Whenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track
4601,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,I go by a poor old farmhouse with its shingles broken and black.
4602,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"I suppose I’ve passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minute"
4603,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"And look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it."
4604,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4605,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"I never have seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;"
4606,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"That they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings."
4607,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"I know this house isn’t haunted, and I wish it were, I do;"
4608,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,For it wouldn’t be so lonely if it had a ghost or two.
4609,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4610,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"This house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,"
4611,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,And somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.
4612,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"It needs new paint and shingles, and the vines should be trimmed and"
4613,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,tied;
4614,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,But what it needs the most of all is some people living inside.
4615,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4616,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,If I had a lot of money and all my debts were paid
4617,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,I’d put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.
4618,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,I’d buy that place and fix it up the way it used to be
4619,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,And I’d find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free.
4620,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4621,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"Now, a new house standing empty, with staring window and door,"
4622,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"Looks idle, perhaps, and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store."
4623,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,But there’s nothing mournful about it; it cannot be sad and lone
4624,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,For the lack of something within it that it has never known.
4625,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4626,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"But a house that has done what a house should do, a house that has"
4627,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"sheltered life,"
4628,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"That has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,"
4629,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"A house that has echoed a baby’s laugh and held up his stumbling feet,"
4630,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"Is the saddest sight, when it’s left alone, that ever your eyes could"
4631,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,meet.
4632,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,
4633,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,So whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track
4634,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"I never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,"
4635,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,Yet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen
4636,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,"apart,"
4637,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,For I can’t help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken
4638,THE HOUSE WITH NOBODY IN IT,heart.

4646,DAVE LILLY,"There’s a brook on the side of Greylock that used to be full of trout,"
4647,DAVE LILLY,But there’s nothing there now but minnows; they say it is all fished out.
4648,DAVE LILLY,"I fished there many a Summer day some twenty years ago,"
4649,DAVE LILLY,"And I never quit without getting a mess of a dozen, or so."
4650,DAVE LILLY,
4651,DAVE LILLY,"There was a man, Dave Lilly, who lived on the North Adams road,"
4652,DAVE LILLY,"And he spent all his time fishing, while his neighbors reaped and sowed."
4653,DAVE LILLY,"He was the luckiest fisherman in the Berkshire hills, I think."
4654,DAVE LILLY,And when he didn’t go fishing he’d sit in the tavern and drink.
4655,DAVE LILLY,
4656,DAVE LILLY,"Well, Dave is dead and buried and nobody cares very much;"
4657,DAVE LILLY,They have no use in Greylock for drunkards and loafers and such.
4658,DAVE LILLY,"But I always liked Dave Lilly, he was pleasant as you could wish;"
4659,DAVE LILLY,"He was shiftless and good-for-nothing, but he certainly could fish."
4660,DAVE LILLY,
4661,DAVE LILLY,The other night I was walking up the hill from Williamstown
4662,DAVE LILLY,"And I came to the brook I mentioned, and I stopped on the bridge and sat"
4663,DAVE LILLY,down.
4664,DAVE LILLY,I looked at the blackened water with its little flecks of white
4665,DAVE LILLY,And I heard it ripple and whisper in the still of the Summer night.
4666,DAVE LILLY,
4667,DAVE LILLY,And after I’d been there a minute it seemed to me I could feel
4668,DAVE LILLY,"The presence of someone near me, and I heard the hum of a reel."
4669,DAVE LILLY,"And the water was churned and broken, and something was brought to land"
4670,DAVE LILLY,By a twist and flirt of a shadowy rod in a deft and shadowy hand.
4671,DAVE LILLY,
4672,DAVE LILLY,I scrambled down to the brookside and hunted all about;
4673,DAVE LILLY,There wasn’t a sign of a fisherman; there wasn’t a sign of a trout.
4674,DAVE LILLY,But I heard somebody chuckle behind the hollow oak
4675,DAVE LILLY,And I got a whiff of tobacco like Lilly used to smoke.
4676,DAVE LILLY,
4677,DAVE LILLY,"It’s fifteen years, they tell me, since anyone fished that brook;"
4678,DAVE LILLY,And there’s nothing in it but minnows that nibble the bait off your hook.
4679,DAVE LILLY,But before the sun has risen and after the moon has set
4680,DAVE LILLY,I know that it’s full of ghostly trout for Lilly’s ghost to get.
4681,DAVE LILLY,
4682,DAVE LILLY,I guess I’ll go to the tavern and get a bottle of rye
4683,DAVE LILLY,"And leave it down by the hollow oak, where Lilly’s ghost went by."
4684,DAVE LILLY,I meant to go up on the hillside and try to find his grave
4685,DAVE LILLY,And put some flowers on it--but this will be better for Dave.

5144,SAID THE ROSE,He never heeds the violets or lilies tall and white;
5145,SAID THE ROSE,"I am his love, his only love, his Flower of Delight;"
5146,SAID THE ROSE,And often when the cold moonbeams are lying all around
5147,SAID THE ROSE,My lover kneels the whole night through beside me on the ground.
5148,SAID THE ROSE,
5149,SAID THE ROSE,How can I miss the sunshine-laden breezes of the south
5150,SAID THE ROSE,When all my heart is burning with the kisses of his mouth?
5151,SAID THE ROSE,How can I miss the coming of the comfort-bringing rain
5152,SAID THE ROSE,When his hot tears are filling me with heaven-sweet love-pain?
5153,SAID THE ROSE,
5154,SAID THE ROSE,"There is a jealous little bird that envies me my love,"
5155,SAID THE ROSE,"He sings this bitter, bitter song from his brown nest above:"
5156,SAID THE ROSE,“Was ever yet a mortal man who wed a flower wife?
5157,SAID THE ROSE,He loves the girl down in your roots whose dead breast gives you life.”
5158,SAID THE ROSE,
5159,SAID THE ROSE,"O little bird, O jealous bird, fly off and cease your chatter!"
5160,SAID THE ROSE,"My lover is my lover, and what can a dead girl matter?"
5161,SAID THE ROSE,In his hot kisses and sweet tears I shall my petals steep;
5162,SAID THE ROSE,"I am his love, his only love, I have his heart to keep."

5207,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5208,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5209,THE CLOUDED SUN,"It is not good for poets to grow old,"
5210,THE CLOUDED SUN,For they serve Death that loves and Love that kills;
5211,THE CLOUDED SUN,"And Love and Death, enthroned above the hills,"
5212,THE CLOUDED SUN,Call back their faithful servants to the fold
5213,THE CLOUDED SUN,Before Age makes them passionless and cold.
5214,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5215,THE CLOUDED SUN,Therefore it is that no more sorry thing
5216,THE CLOUDED SUN,Can shut the sunlight from the thirsty grass
5217,THE CLOUDED SUN,Than some grey head through which no longer pass
5218,THE CLOUDED SUN,Wild dreams more lively than the scent of Spring
5219,THE CLOUDED SUN,To fire the blood and make the glad mouth sing.
5220,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5221,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Far happier he, who, young and full of pride"
5222,THE CLOUDED SUN,"And radiant with the glory of the sun,"
5223,THE CLOUDED SUN,Leaves earth before his singing time is done.
5224,THE CLOUDED SUN,"All wounds of Time the graveyard flowers hide,"
5225,THE CLOUDED SUN,"His beauty lives, as fresh as when he died."
5226,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5227,THE CLOUDED SUN,Then through the words wherein his spirit dwells
5228,THE CLOUDED SUN,The world may see his young impetuous face
5229,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Unmarred by Time, with undiminished grace;"

5238,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Uncomforted and sick with pain we go,"

5240,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5241,THE CLOUDED SUN,"The London lights flare on the chattering street,"

5244,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Once thou couldst feel that this was very sweet,"
5245,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Now thou art still--mouth, hands and weary feet."
5246,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5247,THE CLOUDED SUN,"O subtle mouth, whereon the Sphinx has placed"

5250,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Nay, thou art dumb. Not even April’s taste"
5251,THE CLOUDED SUN,Is sweet to thee in thy live coffin cased.
5252,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5253,THE CLOUDED SUN,There is no harsher tragedy than this--
5254,THE CLOUDED SUN,"That thou, who feltest as no man before"
5255,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Scent, colour, taste and sound and didst outpour"
5256,THE CLOUDED SUN,For us rich draughts of thine enchanted bliss
5257,THE CLOUDED SUN,Shouldst be plunged down this cruel black abyss.
5258,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5259,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Brother and Master, if our love could free"
5260,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Thy flameborne spirit from its leaden chain,"
5261,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Thou shouldst rise up from this sad house of pain,"
5262,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Be young and fair as thou wast wont to be,"
5263,THE CLOUDED SUN,And strong with joy as is the boundless sea.
5264,THE CLOUDED SUN,
5265,THE CLOUDED SUN,"Brother and Master, at thy feet we lay"
5266,THE CLOUDED SUN,"These roses, red as lips that thou hast sung,"
5267,THE CLOUDED SUN,"To mingle with the green and fragrant bay,"
5268,THE CLOUDED SUN,And cypress wreaths above thy head are hung.

5311,BEAUTY’S HAIR,"Of your transcendent hair,"
5312,BEAUTY’S HAIR,"Your luminous, miraculous, and morning-coloured hair."

5314,BEAUTY’S HAIR,I’ll take my silver javelin

5317,BEAUTY’S HAIR,And reach to where you are.
5318,BEAUTY’S HAIR,My javelin’s barb shall pierce your hair
5319,BEAUTY’S HAIR,"And pin it to the sky,"

5355,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5356,THE WAY OF LOVE,(An Old Legend)
5357,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5358,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5359,THE WAY OF LOVE,When darkness hovers over earth
5360,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And day gives place to night,"
5361,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then lovers see the Milky Way
5362,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Gleam mystically bright,"
5363,THE WAY OF LOVE,And calling it the Way of Love
5364,THE WAY OF LOVE,They hail it with delight.
5365,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5366,THE WAY OF LOVE,"She was a lady wondrous fair,"
5367,THE WAY OF LOVE,"A right brave lover he,"
5368,THE WAY OF LOVE,And sooth they suffered grievous pain
5369,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And sorrowed mightily,"
5370,THE WAY OF LOVE,For they were parted during life
5371,THE WAY OF LOVE,By leagues of land and sea.
5372,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5373,THE WAY OF LOVE,She died. Then Death came to the man.
5374,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He met him joyfully,"
5375,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And said, “Thou Angel Death, well met!"
5376,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Quick, do thy will with me,"
5377,THE WAY OF LOVE,That I may haste to greet my love
5378,THE WAY OF LOVE,In Heaven’s company.”
5379,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5380,THE WAY OF LOVE,Now on one side of Heaven he dwelt
5381,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And on the other, she;"
5382,THE WAY OF LOVE,And broad between them stretched sheer space
5383,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Whereon no way might be,"
5384,THE WAY OF LOVE,"The empty, yawning, awful depth,"
5385,THE WAY OF LOVE,Unplumbed infinity.
5386,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5387,THE WAY OF LOVE,The deathless spheric melody
5388,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Came gently to his ear,"
5389,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And dulcet notes, the harmonies"
5390,THE WAY OF LOVE,Of Seraphs chanting near.
5391,THE WAY OF LOVE,He heeded not for listening
5392,THE WAY OF LOVE,His lady’s voice to hear.
5393,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5394,THE WAY OF LOVE,The Saints and Martyrs round him ranged
5395,THE WAY OF LOVE,"A goodly company,"
5396,THE WAY OF LOVE,"The Virgin, robed in radiance,"
5397,THE WAY OF LOVE,The Holy Trinity.
5398,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He heeded not, but strained his eyes"
5399,THE WAY OF LOVE,His lady’s face to see.
5400,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5401,THE WAY OF LOVE,At last from far across the void
5402,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Her voice came, faint and sweet."
5403,THE WAY OF LOVE,The bright-hued walls of Paradise
5404,THE WAY OF LOVE,Did the glad sound repeat;
5405,THE WAY OF LOVE,The distant stars on which she stood
5406,THE WAY OF LOVE,Shone bright beneath her feet.
5407,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5408,THE WAY OF LOVE,"“Dear Love,” she said, “Oh, come to me!"
5409,THE WAY OF LOVE,I cannot see your face.
5410,THE WAY OF LOVE,O will not Lord Christ grant to us
5411,THE WAY OF LOVE,To cross this sea of space?”
5412,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then thrilled his heart with Love’s own might.
5413,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He answered, by Love’s grace."
5414,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5415,THE WAY OF LOVE,"“The world is wide, and Heaven is wide,"
5416,THE WAY OF LOVE,"From me to thee is far,"
5417,THE WAY OF LOVE,Alas! across Infinity
5418,THE WAY OF LOVE,No passageways there are.
5419,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Sweetheart, I’ll make my way to thee,"
5420,THE WAY OF LOVE,"I’ll build it, star by star!”"
5421,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5422,THE WAY OF LOVE,Through all the curving vault of sky
5423,THE WAY OF LOVE,His lusty blows rang out.
5424,THE WAY OF LOVE,He smote the jewel-studded walls
5425,THE WAY OF LOVE,And with a mighty shout
5426,THE WAY OF LOVE,He tore the gleaming masonry
5427,THE WAY OF LOVE,And posts that stood about.
5428,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5429,THE WAY OF LOVE,He strove to build a massive bridge
5430,THE WAY OF LOVE,That should the chasm span.
5431,THE WAY OF LOVE,With heart upheld by hope and love
5432,THE WAY OF LOVE,"His great task he began,"
5433,THE WAY OF LOVE,And toiled and laboured doughtily
5434,THE WAY OF LOVE,To work his God-like plan.
5435,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5436,THE WAY OF LOVE,He took the heavy beams of gold
5437,THE WAY OF LOVE,That round him he did see;
5438,THE WAY OF LOVE,"The beryl, jacinth, sardius,"
5439,THE WAY OF LOVE,"That shone so brilliantly,"
5440,THE WAY OF LOVE,And no fair jewel would he spare
5441,THE WAY OF LOVE,So zealously worked he.
5442,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5443,THE WAY OF LOVE,He stole the gorgeous tinted stuffs
5444,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Whereof are sunsets made,"
5445,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And his rude, grasping, eager hands"
5446,THE WAY OF LOVE,On little stars he laid;
5447,THE WAY OF LOVE,To rob God’s sacred treasure-house
5448,THE WAY OF LOVE,He was no whit afraid.
5449,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5450,THE WAY OF LOVE,And so for centuries he worked.
5451,THE WAY OF LOVE,Across the void at last
5452,THE WAY OF LOVE,A bridge of precious mold did stand
5453,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Completed, strong and fast."
5454,THE WAY OF LOVE,So now the faithful lovers met
5455,THE WAY OF LOVE,And all their woe was past.
5456,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5457,THE WAY OF LOVE,But soon a shining angel guard
5458,THE WAY OF LOVE,Sped to the throne of gold
5459,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And said, “Lord, see yon new-made bridge,"
5460,THE WAY OF LOVE,"A mortal, overbold,"
5461,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Has built it, scorning thy desire!”"
5462,THE WAY OF LOVE,Straightway the tale he told.
5463,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5464,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Then said: “Now, Master, Thou mayst see"
5465,THE WAY OF LOVE,The thing that has been wrought.
5466,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Speak, then, the word, stretch forth Thine hand"
5467,THE WAY OF LOVE,That with the speed of thought
5468,THE WAY OF LOVE,This poor presumptuous work may fall
5469,THE WAY OF LOVE,And crumble into naught.”
5470,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5471,THE WAY OF LOVE,God looked upon the angel then
5472,THE WAY OF LOVE,And on the bridge below.
5473,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then with His smile of majesty
5474,THE WAY OF LOVE,"He said: “Let all things know,"
5475,THE WAY OF LOVE,"This bridge, which has by Love been built,"
5476,THE WAY OF LOVE,I will not overthrow.”
5477,THE WAY OF LOVE,
5478,THE WAY OF LOVE,When darkness hovers over earth
5479,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And day gives place to night,"
5480,THE WAY OF LOVE,Then lovers see the Milky Way
5481,THE WAY OF LOVE,"Gleam mystically bright,"
5482,THE WAY OF LOVE,"And calling it the Way of Love,"
5483,THE WAY OF LOVE,They hail it with delight.

5503,CHEVELY CROSSING,One summer night did wait;

5506,CHEVELY CROSSING,
5507,CHEVELY CROSSING,"The angels saw her sinless face,"

5510,CHEVELY CROSSING,And would not come inside.

5512,CHEVELY CROSSING,She hid her face and cried.
5513,CHEVELY CROSSING,
5514,CHEVELY CROSSING,Her tears dropped down like sun-filled rain
5515,CHEVELY CROSSING,"Through stars and starless space,"
5516,CHEVELY CROSSING,Until at last in Chevely town
5517,CHEVELY CROSSING,Where in a moonlit place
5518,CHEVELY CROSSING,"Her lover knelt upon her grave,"
5519,CHEVELY CROSSING,They fell upon his face.
5520,CHEVELY CROSSING,
5521,CHEVELY CROSSING,"Said he, “My love, my only love,"
5522,CHEVELY CROSSING,"My Elena, my Sweet!"
5523,CHEVELY CROSSING,Through what wild ways of mystery
5524,CHEVELY CROSSING,Have strayed your little feet?

5529,CHEVELY CROSSING,"That turns my heart to lead,"
5530,CHEVELY CROSSING,"Not for my empty arms I mourn,"
5531,CHEVELY CROSSING,Nor for my loveless bed;
5532,CHEVELY CROSSING,But that you wander forth alone
5533,CHEVELY CROSSING,On heights I may not tread.
5534,CHEVELY CROSSING,
5535,CHEVELY CROSSING,"“If I could stand beside you now,"
5536,CHEVELY CROSSING,"Sin-burdened though I be,"
5537,CHEVELY CROSSING,I’d bear you through the trackless ways
5538,CHEVELY CROSSING,"From fear and danger free,"
5539,CHEVELY CROSSING,Not God himself could daunt the strong

5557,CHEVELY CROSSING,
5558,CHEVELY CROSSING,Where two roads cross by Chevely town
5559,CHEVELY CROSSING,A man is lying dead.
5560,CHEVELY CROSSING,The rumbling wains of scented hay
5561,CHEVELY CROSSING,Roll over his fair head;
5562,CHEVELY CROSSING,"A stake is driven through his heart,"
5563,CHEVELY CROSSING,For his own blood he shed.

5569,THE OTHER LOVER,
5570,THE OTHER LOVER,
5571,THE OTHER LOVER,"I’m home from off the stormy sea,"
5572,THE OTHER LOVER,And down the street
5573,THE OTHER LOVER,The folk come out to welcome me
5574,THE OTHER LOVER,On eager feet.
5575,THE OTHER LOVER,"O neighbours, God be with you all,"
5576,THE OTHER LOVER,But for my true love I must call;
5577,THE OTHER LOVER,She lingers in her father’s hall
5578,THE OTHER LOVER,"So shy, so sweet!"
5579,THE OTHER LOVER,
5580,THE OTHER LOVER,Here is a string of milky pearls
5581,THE OTHER LOVER,"For her to wear,"
5582,THE OTHER LOVER,An amber comb to match the curls
5583,THE OTHER LOVER,Of her bright hair.
5584,THE OTHER LOVER,"O neighbours, do not crowd me so!"
5585,THE OTHER LOVER,Stand by! stand by! for I must go
5586,THE OTHER LOVER,To put on my love’s hand of snow
5587,THE OTHER LOVER,This gold ring fair.
5588,THE OTHER LOVER,
5589,THE OTHER LOVER,"Good dame, why do you block the way"
5590,THE OTHER LOVER,And shake your head?
5591,THE OTHER LOVER,Must all the things you have to say
5592,THE OTHER LOVER,Just now be said?
5593,THE OTHER LOVER,"O neighbours, let me pass--but why--"
5594,THE OTHER LOVER,"My God, what makes you women cry?"
5595,THE OTHER LOVER,Come tell me that I too may die!
5596,THE OTHER LOVER,Is my love dead?
5597,THE OTHER LOVER,
5598,THE OTHER LOVER,"“Nay, Marjorie’s a living thing,"
5599,THE OTHER LOVER,And fair and strong.
5600,THE OTHER LOVER,Yet did you wait to give your ring
5601,THE OTHER LOVER,A year too long.
5602,THE OTHER LOVER,To seek her love there came the Moon;
5603,THE OTHER LOVER,Now Marjorie at night and noon
5604,THE OTHER LOVER,Is chained and sits alone to croon
5605,THE OTHER LOVER,The Moon’s love-song.”
