109,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,THE RIDE TO THE LADY
110,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
111,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
112,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"""Now since mine even is come at last,--"
113,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"For I have been the sport of steel,"
114,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"And hot life ebbeth from me fast,"
115,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"And I in saddle roll and reel,--"
116,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Come bind me, bind me on my steed!"
117,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Of fingering leech I have no need!"""
118,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,The chaplain clasped his mailed knee.
119,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"""Nor need I more thy whine and thee!"
120,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,No time is left my sins to tell;
121,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"But look ye bind me, bind me well!"""
122,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"They bound him strong with leathern thong,"
123,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,For the ride to the lady should be long.
124,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
125,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Day was dying; the poplars fled,"
126,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Thin as ghosts, on a sky blood-red;"
127,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Out of the sky the fierce hue fell,"
128,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,And made the streams as the streams of hell.
129,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"All his thoughts as a river flowed,"
130,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Flowed aflame as fleet he rode,"
131,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Onward flowed to her abode,"
132,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Ceased at her feet, mirrored her face."
133,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"(Viewless Death apace, apace,"
134,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Rode behind him in that race.)
135,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
136,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"""Face, mine own, mine alone,"
137,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Trembling lips my lips have known,"
138,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Birdlike stir of the dove-soft eyne
139,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Under the kisses that make them mine!
140,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Only of thee, of thee, my need!"
141,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Only to thee, to thee, I speed!"""
142,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,The Cross flashed by at the highway's turn;
143,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,In a beam of the moon the Face shone stern.
144,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
145,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Far behind had the fight's din died;
146,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,The shuddering stars in the welkin wide
147,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Crowded, crowded, to see him ride."
148,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,The beating hearts of the stars aloof
149,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"kept time to the beat of the horse's hoof,"
150,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"""What is the throb that thrills so sweet?"
151,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Heart of my lady, I feel it beat!"""
152,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"But his own strong pulse the fainter fell,"
153,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Like the failing tongue of a hushing bell.
154,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,The flank of the great-limbed steed was wet
155,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Not alone with the started sweat.
156,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
157,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Fast, and fast, and the thick black wood"
158,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Arched its cowl like a black friar's hood;
159,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Fast, and fast, and they plunged therein,--"
160,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"But the viewless rider rode to win,"
161,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Out of the wood to the highway's light
162,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Galloped the great-limbed steed in fright;
163,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"The mail clashed cold, and the sad owl cried,"
164,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,And the weight of the dead oppressed his side.
165,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
166,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Fast, and fast, by the road he knew;"
167,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"And slow, and slow, the stars withdrew;"
168,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"And the waiting heaven turned weirdly blue,"
169,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,As a garment worn of a wizard grim.
170,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,He neighed at the gate in the morning dim.
171,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
172,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"She heard no sound before her gate,"
173,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Though very quiet was her bower.
174,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,All was as her hand had left it late:
175,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"The needle slept on the broidered vine,"
176,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Where the hammer and spikes of the passion-flower
177,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Her fashioning did wait.
178,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"On the couch lay something fair,"
179,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,With steadfast lips and veiled eyne;
180,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
181,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"But the lady was not there,"
182,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"On the wings of shrift and prayer,"
183,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"Pure as winds that winnow snow,"
184,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Her soul had risen twelve hours ago.
185,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,"The burdened steed at the barred gate stood,"
186,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,No whit the nearer to his goal.
187,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,Now God's great grace assoil the soul
188,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,That went out in the wood!
189,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
190,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
191,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
192,THE RIDE TO THE LADY,
193,THE FIRST GUEST,THE FIRST GUEST
194,THE FIRST GUEST,
195,THE FIRST GUEST,
196,THE FIRST GUEST,"When the house is finished, Death enters."
197,THE FIRST GUEST,_Eastern Proverb_
198,THE FIRST GUEST,
199,THE FIRST GUEST,"Life's House being ready all,"
200,THE FIRST GUEST,"Each chamber fair and dumb,"
201,THE FIRST GUEST,"Ere life, the Lord, is come"
202,THE FIRST GUEST,"With pomp into his hall,--"
203,THE FIRST GUEST,"Ere Toil has trod the floors,"
204,THE FIRST GUEST,"Ere Love has lit the fires,"
205,THE FIRST GUEST,Or young great-eyed Desires
206,THE FIRST GUEST,"Have, timid, tried the doors;"
207,THE FIRST GUEST,Or from east-window leaned
208,THE FIRST GUEST,"One Hope, to greet the sun,"
209,THE FIRST GUEST,Or one gray Sorrow screened
210,THE FIRST GUEST,"Her sight against the west,--"
211,THE FIRST GUEST,"Then enters the first guest,"
212,THE FIRST GUEST,The House of life being done.
213,THE FIRST GUEST,
214,THE FIRST GUEST,He waits there in the shade.
215,THE FIRST GUEST,"I deem he is Life's twin,"
216,THE FIRST GUEST,For whom the house was made.
217,THE FIRST GUEST,"Whatever his true name,"
218,THE FIRST GUEST,"Be sure, to enter in"
219,THE FIRST GUEST,He has both key and claim.
220,THE FIRST GUEST,
221,THE FIRST GUEST,"The daybeams, free of fear,"
222,THE FIRST GUEST,Creep drowsy toward his feet;
223,THE FIRST GUEST,"His heart were heard to beat,"
224,THE FIRST GUEST,Were any there to hear;
225,THE FIRST GUEST,"Ah, not for ends malign,"
226,THE FIRST GUEST,"Like wild thing crouched in lair,"
227,THE FIRST GUEST,"Or watcher of a snare,"
228,THE FIRST GUEST,But with a friend's design
229,THE FIRST GUEST,He lurks in shadow there!
230,THE FIRST GUEST,
231,THE FIRST GUEST,He goes not to the gates
232,THE FIRST GUEST,"To welcome any other,"
233,THE FIRST GUEST,"Nay, not Lord Life, his brother;"
234,THE FIRST GUEST,But still his hour awaits
235,THE FIRST GUEST,Each several guest to find
236,THE FIRST GUEST,"Alone, yea, quite alone;"
237,THE FIRST GUEST,Pacing with pensive mind
238,THE FIRST GUEST,"The cloister's echoing stone,"
239,THE FIRST GUEST,"Or singing, unaware,"
240,THE FIRST GUEST,At the turning of the stair
241,THE FIRST GUEST,"Tis truth, though we forget,"
242,THE FIRST GUEST,In Life's House enters none
243,THE FIRST GUEST,"Who shall that seeker shun,"
244,THE FIRST GUEST,Who shall not so be met.
245,THE FIRST GUEST,"""Is this mine hour?"" each saith."
246,THE FIRST GUEST,"""So be it, gentle Death!"""
247,THE FIRST GUEST,"Each has his way to end,"
248,THE FIRST GUEST,Encountering this friend.
249,THE FIRST GUEST,Griefs die to memories mild;
250,THE FIRST GUEST,Hope turns a weanèd child;
251,THE FIRST GUEST,"Love shines a spirit white,"
252,THE FIRST GUEST,With eyes of deepened light.
253,THE FIRST GUEST,"When many a guest has passed,"
254,THE FIRST GUEST,Some day 'tis Life's at last
255,THE FIRST GUEST,To front the face of Death.
256,THE FIRST GUEST,"Then, casements closed, men say:"
257,THE FIRST GUEST,"""Lord Life is gone away;"
258,THE FIRST GUEST,"He went, we trust and pray,"
259,THE FIRST GUEST,"To God, who gave him breath."""
260,THE FIRST GUEST,"Beginning, End, He is:"
261,THE FIRST GUEST,Are not these sons both His?
262,THE FIRST GUEST,"Lo, these with Him are one!"
263,THE FIRST GUEST,To phrase it so were best:
264,THE FIRST GUEST,"God's self is that first Guest,"
265,THE FIRST GUEST,The House of Life being done!
266,THE FIRST GUEST,
267,THE FIRST GUEST,
268,THE FIRST GUEST,
269,THE FIRST GUEST,
270,SILENCE,SILENCE
271,SILENCE,
272,SILENCE,
273,SILENCE,"Why should I sing of earth or heaven? not rather rest,"
274,SILENCE,"Powerless to speak of that which hath my soul possessed,--"
275,SILENCE,"For full possession dumb? Yea, Silence, that were best."
276,SILENCE,
277,SILENCE,"And though for what it failed to sound I brake the string,"
278,SILENCE,"And dashed the sweet lute down, a too much fingered thing,"
279,SILENCE,"And found a wild new voice,--oh, still, why should I sing?"
280,SILENCE,
281,SILENCE,"An earth-song could I make, strange as the breath of earth,"
282,SILENCE,Filled with the great calm joy of life and death and birth?
283,SILENCE,"Yet, were it less than this, the song were little worth."
284,SILENCE,
285,SILENCE,For this the fields caress; brown clods tell each to each;
286,SILENCE,Sad-colored leaves have sense whereto I cannot reach;
287,SILENCE,Spiced everlasting-flowers outstrip my range of speech.
288,SILENCE,
289,SILENCE,"A heaven-song could I make, all fire that yet was peace,"
290,SILENCE,"And tenderness not lost, though glory did increase?"
291,SILENCE,"But were it less than this, 't were well the song should cease."
292,SILENCE,
293,SILENCE,"For this the still west saith, with plumy flames bestrewn;"
294,SILENCE,"Heaven's body sapphire-clear, at stirless height of noon;"
295,SILENCE,"The cloud where lightnings pulse, beside the untroubled moon."
296,SILENCE,
297,SILENCE,"I will not sing of earth or heaven, but rather rest,"
298,SILENCE,"Rapt by the face of heaven, and hold on earth's warm breast."
299,SILENCE,"Hushed lips, a beating heart, yea, Silence, that were best."

307,ARRAIGNMENT,"""Not ye who have stoned, not ye who have smitten us,"" cry"
308,ARRAIGNMENT,"The sad, great souls, as they go out hence into dark,"
309,ARRAIGNMENT,"""Not ye we accuse, though for you was our passion borne;"
310,ARRAIGNMENT,"And ye we reproach not, who silently passed us by."
311,ARRAIGNMENT,"We forgive blind eyes and the ears that would not hark,"
312,ARRAIGNMENT,The careless and causeless hate and the shallow scorn.
313,ARRAIGNMENT,
314,ARRAIGNMENT,"""But ye, who have seemed to know us, have seen and heard;"
315,ARRAIGNMENT,Who have set us at feasts and have crowned with the costly rose;
316,ARRAIGNMENT,Who have spread us the purple of praises beneath our feet;
317,ARRAIGNMENT,"Yet guessed not the word that we spake was a living word,"
318,ARRAIGNMENT,"Applauding the sound,--we account you as worse than foes!"
319,ARRAIGNMENT,"We sobbed you our message; ye said, 'It is song, and sweet!'"""

324,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE
325,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
326,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
327,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"The eastern heaven was all faint amethyst,"
328,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Whereon the moon hung dreaming in the mist;
329,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,To north yet drifted one long delicate plume
330,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Of roseate cloud; like snow the ocean-spume.
331,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
332,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Now when the first foreboding swiftly ran
333,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Through the loud-glorying sea that it began
334,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"To lose its late gained lordship of the land,"
335,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Uprose the billow like an angered man,"
336,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,And flung its prone strength far along the sand;
337,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Almost, almost to the old bound, the dark"
338,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,And taunting triumph-mark.
339,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
340,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"But no, no, no! and slow, and slow, and slow,"
341,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Like a heart losing hold, this wave must go,--"
342,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Must go, must go,--dragged heavily back, back,"
343,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Beneath the next wave plunging on its track,"
344,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Charging, with thunderous and defiant shout,"
345,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,To fore-determined rout.
346,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
347,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Again, again the unexhausted main"
348,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Renews fierce effort, drawing force unguessed"
349,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,From awful deeps of its mysterious breast:
350,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Like arms of passionate protest, tossed in vain,"
351,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,The spray upflings above the billow's crest.
352,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Again the appulse, again the backward strain--"
353,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Till ocean must have rest.
354,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
355,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"With one abandoned movement, swift and wild,--"
356,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,As though bowed head and outstretched arms it laid
357,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"On the earth's lap, soft sobbing,--hushed and stayed,"
358,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"The great sea quiets, like a soothed child."
359,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Ha! what sharp memory clove the calm, and drave"
360,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,This last fleet furious wave?
361,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
362,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"On, on, endures the struggle into night,"
363,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Ancient as Time, yet fresh as the fresh hour;"
364,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,As oft repeated since the birth of light
365,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,As the strong agony and mortal fight
366,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Of human souls, blind-reaching, with the Power"
367,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Aloof, unmoved, impossible to cross,"
368,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Whose law is seeming loss.
369,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
370,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Low-sunken from the longed-for triumph-mark;
371,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,The spent sea sighs as one that grieves in sleep.
372,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,The unveiled moon along the rippling plain
373,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Casts many a keen, cold, shifting silvery spark,"
374,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"Wild as the pulses of strange joy, that leap"
375,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Even in the quick of pain.
376,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
377,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"And she compelling, she that stands for law,--"
378,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"As law for Will eternal,--perfect, clear,"
379,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,And uncompassionate shines: to her appear
380,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Vast sequences close-linked without a flaw.
381,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"All past despairs of ocean unforgot,"
382,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"All raptures past, serene her light she gives,"
383,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,"The moon too high for pity, since she lives"
384,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,Aware that loss is not.
385,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
386,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
387,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
388,THE GOING OUT OF THE TIDE,
389,KING RAEDWALD,KING RAEDWALD
390,KING RAEDWALD,
391,KING RAEDWALD,
392,KING RAEDWALD,"Will you hear now the speech of King Raedwald,--heathen Raedwald,"
393,KING RAEDWALD,the simple yet wise?
394,KING RAEDWALD,"He, the ruler of North-folk and South-folk, a man open-browed"
395,KING RAEDWALD,"as the skies,"
396,KING RAEDWALD,"Held the eyes of the eager Italians with his blue, bold,"
397,KING RAEDWALD,Englishman's eyes.
398,KING RAEDWALD,
399,KING RAEDWALD,"In his hall, on his throne, so he sat, with the light of the fire"
400,KING RAEDWALD,on him full:
401,KING RAEDWALD,"Colored bright as the ring of red gold on his hand, fit to buffet"
402,KING RAEDWALD,"a bull,"
403,KING RAEDWALD,"Was the mane that grew down on his neck, was the beard he would"
404,KING RAEDWALD,pondering pull.
405,KING RAEDWALD,
406,KING RAEDWALD,"To the priests, to the eager Italians, thus fearless less he poured"
407,KING RAEDWALD,his free speech;
408,KING RAEDWALD,"""O my honey-tongued fathers, I turn not away from the faith that ye"
409,KING RAEDWALD,teach!
410,KING RAEDWALD,"Not the less hath a man many moods, and may ask a religion for each."
411,KING RAEDWALD,
412,KING RAEDWALD,"""Grant that all things are well with the realm on a delicate day"
413,KING RAEDWALD,"of the spring,"
414,KING RAEDWALD,"Easter month, time of hopes and of swallows!"
415,KING RAEDWALD,"The praises, the psalms that ye sing,"
416,KING RAEDWALD,"As in pleasant accord they float heavenward, are good in the ears"
417,KING RAEDWALD,of the king.
418,KING RAEDWALD,
419,KING RAEDWALD,"""Then the heart bubbles forth with clear waters, to the time"
420,KING RAEDWALD,"of this wonder-word Peace,"
421,KING RAEDWALD,From the chanting and preaching whereof ye who serve the
422,KING RAEDWALD,white Christ never cease;
423,KING RAEDWALD,"And your curly, soft incense ascending enwraps my content"
424,KING RAEDWALD,like a fleece.
425,KING RAEDWALD,
426,KING RAEDWALD,"""But a churl comes adrip from the rivers, pants me out, fallen"
427,KING RAEDWALD,"spent on the floor,"
428,KING RAEDWALD,"'O King Raedwald, Northumberland marches, and to-morrow knocks"
429,KING RAEDWALD,"hard at thy door,"
430,KING RAEDWALD,Hot for melting thy crown on the hearth!'
431,KING RAEDWALD,Then commend me to Woden and Thor!
432,KING RAEDWALD,
433,KING RAEDWALD,"""Could I sit then and listen to preachments on turning the cheek"
434,KING RAEDWALD,"to the blow,"
435,KING RAEDWALD,"And saying a prayer for the smiter, and holding my seen treasure low"
436,KING RAEDWALD,"For the sake of a treasure unseen? By the sledge of the Thunderer, no!"
437,KING RAEDWALD,
438,KING RAEDWALD,"""For my thought flashes out as a sword, cleaving counsel as"
439,KING RAEDWALD,clottage of cream;
440,KING RAEDWALD,And your incense and chanting are but as the smoke of burnt
441,KING RAEDWALD,towns and the scream;
442,KING RAEDWALD,And I quaff me the thick mead of triumph from enemies' skulls
443,KING RAEDWALD,in my dream!
444,KING RAEDWALD,
445,KING RAEDWALD,"""And 'tis therefore this day I resolve me,--for King Raedwald"
446,KING RAEDWALD,"will cringe not, nor lie!--"
447,KING RAEDWALD,"I will bring back the altar  of Woden; in the temple will have it,"
448,KING RAEDWALD,hard by
449,KING RAEDWALD,"The new altar of this your white Christ. As my mood may decide,"
450,KING RAEDWALD,"worship I!"""
451,KING RAEDWALD,
452,KING RAEDWALD,"So he spake in his large self-reliance,--he, a man open-browed"
453,KING RAEDWALD,as the skies;
454,KING RAEDWALD,Would not measure his soul by a standard that was womanish-weak
455,KING RAEDWALD,"to his eyes,"

1321,THE ENCOUNTER,"Running lightly,--oh, so fleetly!"

1326,THE ENCOUNTER,"As she answered, laughing sweetly,"
1327,THE ENCOUNTER,"On she ran, as flies the swallow;"

1345,THE ENCOUNTER,"Laughing while she featly footed,"
1346,THE ENCOUNTER,"With the herd-boy hasting after,"
1347,THE ENCOUNTER,"Sprang she on a trunk uprooted,"
1348,THE ENCOUNTER,Clung she by a roping vine;
1349,THE ENCOUNTER,"Leaped behind a birch, and told,"
1350,THE ENCOUNTER,"Still eluding, through its fine,"
1351,THE ENCOUNTER,"Mocking, slender, leafy laughter,"
1352,THE ENCOUNTER,Why her finger tips were cold:
1353,THE ENCOUNTER,
1354,THE ENCOUNTER,"""I went down to tease the brook,"
1355,THE ENCOUNTER,"With her fishes, there below;"

1363,THE ENCOUNTER,"There be smooth, clear sweeps, and swirls"
1364,THE ENCOUNTER,Bubbling up crisp drops like pearls.
1365,THE ENCOUNTER,"There I lie, along the rocks"
1366,THE ENCOUNTER,"Thick with greenest slippery moss,"
1367,THE ENCOUNTER,And I have in hand a strip
1368,THE ENCOUNTER,"Of gray, pliant, dappled bark;"
1369,THE ENCOUNTER,And I comb her liquid locks
1370,THE ENCOUNTER,Till her tangling currents cross;
1371,THE ENCOUNTER,And I have delight to hark
1372,THE ENCOUNTER,"To the chiding of her lip,"
1373,THE ENCOUNTER,Taking on the talking stone
1374,THE ENCOUNTER,With each turn another tone.
1375,THE ENCOUNTER,"Oh, to set her wavelets bickering!"
1376,THE ENCOUNTER,"Oh, to hear her laughter simple,"

1385,THE ENCOUNTER,"Sharply on his longing lips,"
1386,THE ENCOUNTER,Stung him as the birch bough whips:
1387,THE ENCOUNTER,Was it kiss or was it blow?
1388,THE ENCOUNTER,Never after could he know;
1389,THE ENCOUNTER,She was gone without a sound.
1390,THE ENCOUNTER,
1391,THE ENCOUNTER,Never after could he see
1392,THE ENCOUNTER,"In the wood or in the mead,"
1393,THE ENCOUNTER,Or in any company
1394,THE ENCOUNTER,"Of the rustic mortal maids,"
1395,THE ENCOUNTER,Her with acorn-colored braids;
