71,PREFACE,
72,PREFACE,
73,PREFACE,THIS volume has been garnered from the author's earlier
74,PREFACE,"books. Two poems have been chosen from ""The White Sail"" (1887);"
75,PREFACE,"nine Oxford Sonnets from a privately printed booklet (1895), since"
76,PREFACE,"added to, and much altered; and many lyrics, under a revised form,"
77,PREFACE,"from ""A Roadside Harp"" (1893), and ""The Martyrs' Idyl"" (1899), plus"
78,PREFACE,"some twenty newer titles transferred, with grateful acknowledgments,"
79,PREFACE,"from _McClure's Magazine_, _The Atlantic_, _Harper's_, _Scribner's_,"
80,PREFACE,and _The Century_. The principle of exclusion goes far enough to
81,PREFACE,"cover all poems in narrative form, or of any appreciable length, or"
82,PREFACE,"translated; also, any which seemed out of keeping with the character"
83,PREFACE,"of the present collection. Such as that is, it comprises the less"
84,PREFACE,faulty half of all the author's published verse.

345,HAPPY ENDING,

347,HAPPY ENDING,"""My spirits are fallen low,"
348,HAPPY ENDING,And I cannot carry this battle:
349,HAPPY ENDING,O brother! where might I go?
350,HAPPY ENDING,
351,HAPPY ENDING,"""The terrible Kings are on me"
352,HAPPY ENDING,With spears that are deadly bright;
353,HAPPY ENDING,Against me so from the cradle
354,HAPPY ENDING,"Do fate and my fathers fight."""
355,HAPPY ENDING,
356,HAPPY ENDING,Then said to the man his Angel:
357,HAPPY ENDING,"""Thou wavering witless soul,"
358,HAPPY ENDING,Back to the ranks! What matter
359,HAPPY ENDING,"To win or to lose the whole,"
360,HAPPY ENDING,
361,HAPPY ENDING,"""As judged by the little judges"
362,HAPPY ENDING,"Who hearken not well, nor see?"
363,HAPPY ENDING,"Not thus, by the outer issue,"
364,HAPPY ENDING,The Wise shall interpret thee.
365,HAPPY ENDING,
366,HAPPY ENDING,"""Thy will is the sovereign measure"
367,HAPPY ENDING,And only event of things:

369,HAPPY ENDING,Were stronger than all these Kings.
370,HAPPY ENDING,
371,HAPPY ENDING,"""Though out of the past they gather,"
372,HAPPY ENDING,"Mind's Doubt, and Bodily Pain,"
373,HAPPY ENDING,And pallid Thirst of the Spirit
374,HAPPY ENDING,"That is kin to the other twain,"
375,HAPPY ENDING,

381,HAPPY ENDING,"""While Kings of eternal evil"
382,HAPPY ENDING,"Yet darken the hills about,"

384,HAPPY ENDING,To rise on the last redoubt;
385,HAPPY ENDING,
386,HAPPY ENDING,"""To fear not sensible failure,"

398,HAPPY ENDING,"It seemed our birch-tree had,"
399,HAPPY ENDING,"That August hour, intelligence of death;"
400,HAPPY ENDING,For warningly against the eaves she beat
401,HAPPY ENDING,"Her body old, lamenting, prophesying,"
402,HAPPY ENDING,And the hot breath
403,HAPPY ENDING,Of ferny hollows nestled at her feet
404,HAPPY ENDING,Spread out in startled sighing.
405,HAPPY ENDING,
406,HAPPY ENDING,"Across an argent sea,"
407,HAPPY ENDING,"Distinct unto the farthest reef and isle,"
408,HAPPY ENDING,The clouds began to be.
409,HAPPY ENDING,"Huge forms 'neath sombre draperies, awhile"
410,HAPPY ENDING,Made slow uncertain rally;
411,HAPPY ENDING,"But as their ranks conjoined, and from the north"
412,HAPPY ENDING,"The leader shook his lance, Oh, then how fair"
413,HAPPY ENDING,"Unvested, they stood forth,"
414,HAPPY ENDING,"In diverse armour, plumed majestically,"
415,HAPPY ENDING,"Each with his own esquires, a King in air!"
416,HAPPY ENDING,
417,HAPPY ENDING,"Up moved the dark vanguard,"
418,HAPPY ENDING,"With insolent colours that o'erdusked the skies,"
419,HAPPY ENDING,And trailed from beach to beach:
420,HAPPY ENDING,Massed orange and mould-green; vermilion barred
421,HAPPY ENDING,On bronze or mottled silver; saffron dyes
422,HAPPY ENDING,And purples migratory
423,HAPPY ENDING,"Fanned each in each,"
424,HAPPY ENDING,"As the long column broke, athirst for glory."
425,HAPPY ENDING,
426,HAPPY ENDING,"Sudden, the thunder!"
427,HAPPY ENDING,"Upon the roofed verandas how it rolled,"
428,HAPPY ENDING,"Twice, thrice: a thud and flame of doom that told"
429,HAPPY ENDING,"New-fallen, nor far away,"
430,HAPPY ENDING,Some black destruction on the innocent day.
431,HAPPY ENDING,And little Everard
432,HAPPY ENDING,"Deep in the hammock under, eyes alight"
433,HAPPY ENDING,With healthful fear and wonder
434,HAPPY ENDING,"The brave do ne'er unlearn,"
435,HAPPY ENDING,"Clenched his soft hand, and breathing hard,"
436,HAPPY ENDING,"Smiled there against his father, like a knight"
437,HAPPY ENDING,Baptized on Cressy field or Bannockburn.
438,HAPPY ENDING,
439,HAPPY ENDING,"A moment gone,"
440,HAPPY ENDING,"Into our paradise from Acheron,"
441,HAPPY ENDING,With imperceptive sorcery crawled ashore
442,HAPPY ENDING,Odours unnamable: an exhalation
443,HAPPY ENDING,"Of men and ships in oozy graves. (Ah, cease,"
444,HAPPY ENDING,Derisive nereids! cease:
445,HAPPY ENDING,"Be it enough, that even ye can pour,"
446,HAPPY ENDING,"From crystal flagons of your ancient peace,"
447,HAPPY ENDING,So strange obscene libation.)
448,HAPPY ENDING,But with the thunder-peal
449,HAPPY ENDING,"Sprang the pure winds, their thurible swung wide,"
450,HAPPY ENDING,To chase that tainted tide;
451,HAPPY ENDING,"Fresh from the pastures and the cedar-grove,"
452,HAPPY ENDING,"They rode the copper ridges of the main,"
453,HAPPY ENDING,And bared a league of distance to reveal
454,HAPPY ENDING,"A sail, aslant, astrain,"
455,HAPPY ENDING,Impetuous for the cove;
456,HAPPY ENDING,"And tossing after, panic-stricken,"
457,HAPPY ENDING,"Another, and a third: white spirits, fain to sicken,"
458,HAPPY ENDING,Nor out of natural harm salvation gain.
459,HAPPY ENDING,
460,HAPPY ENDING,The selfsame hunter winds that drave
461,HAPPY ENDING,"The horror down, as faithful-hearted drew"
462,HAPPY ENDING,"The sad clouds from their carnage, and up-piled"
463,HAPPY ENDING,"Their rebel gonfalons, or jocund threw"
464,HAPPY ENDING,Their cannon in the wave;
465,HAPPY ENDING,"And subtly, with a parting whisper, gave"
466,HAPPY ENDING,An eve most mild:
467,HAPPY ENDING,"A sunset like a prayer, a world all rose and blue:"
468,HAPPY ENDING,
469,HAPPY ENDING,"A good world, as it was,"
470,HAPPY ENDING,"And as it shall be: clear circumferent space,"
471,HAPPY ENDING,"Where punctual yet, for worship of their Cause,"
472,HAPPY ENDING,The stars came thick in choir.
473,HAPPY ENDING,"Sleep had our Everard in her cool embrace,"
474,HAPPY ENDING,Else from his cot he hardly need have stooped
475,HAPPY ENDING,To see (and laugh to see!) the headland pine
476,HAPPY ENDING,Embossed on changing fire:
477,HAPPY ENDING,"For close behind it, cooped"
478,HAPPY ENDING,"Within a smallest span,"
479,HAPPY ENDING,"In fury, to and fro and round and round,"
480,HAPPY ENDING,The routed leopards of the lightning ran:
481,HAPPY ENDING,"Bright, bright, inside their dungeon-bars, malign"
482,HAPPY ENDING,"They ran; and ran till dawn, without a sound."

492,HAPPY ENDING,Like a leaf at Michaelmas
493,HAPPY ENDING,"Swooning from the tree,"
494,HAPPY ENDING,
495,HAPPY ENDING,Ere its hour the manly mind
496,HAPPY ENDING,"Trembles in a sure decrease,"
497,HAPPY ENDING,Nor the body now can find
498,HAPPY ENDING,Any hold on peace.
499,HAPPY ENDING,
500,HAPPY ENDING,"Take him, weak and overworn;"
501,HAPPY ENDING,Fold about his dying dream
502,HAPPY ENDING,"Boyhood, and the April morn,"
503,HAPPY ENDING,And the rolling stream:
504,HAPPY ENDING,
505,HAPPY ENDING,"Weather on a sunny ridge,"
506,HAPPY ENDING,"Showery weather, far from here;"
507,HAPPY ENDING,"Under some deep-ivied bridge,"
508,HAPPY ENDING,Water rushing clear:
509,HAPPY ENDING,
510,HAPPY ENDING,Water quick to cross and part
511,HAPPY ENDING,"(Golden light on silver sound),"
512,HAPPY ENDING,Weather that was next his heart
513,HAPPY ENDING,All the world around!
514,HAPPY ENDING,
515,HAPPY ENDING,Soon upon his vision break
516,HAPPY ENDING,"These, in their remembered blue;"
517,HAPPY ENDING,"He shall toil no more, but wake"
518,HAPPY ENDING,"Young, in air he knew."
519,HAPPY ENDING,
520,HAPPY ENDING,He hath done with roofs and men.
