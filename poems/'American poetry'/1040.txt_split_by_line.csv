96,,The Valley of the Shadow
97,,
98,,"There were faces to remember in the Valley of the Shadow,"
99,,"There were faces unregarded, there were faces to forget;"
100,,"There were fires of grief and fear that are a few forgotten ashes,"
101,,There were sparks of recognition that are not forgotten yet.
102,,"For at first, with an amazed and overwhelming indignation"
103,,"At a measureless malfeasance that obscurely willed it thus,"
104,,"They were lost and unacquainted -- till they found themselves in others,"
105,,Who had groped as they were groping where dim ways were perilous.
106,,
107,,There were lives that were as dark as are the fears and intuitions
108,,Of a child who knows himself and is alone with what he knows;
109,,"There were pensioners of dreams and there were debtors of illusions,"
110,,All to fail before the triumph of a weed that only grows.
111,,"There were thirsting heirs of golden sieves that held not wine or water,"
112,,And had no names in traffic or more value there than toys:
113,,"There were blighted sons of wonder in the Valley of the Shadow,"
114,,Where they suffered and still wondered why their wonder made no noise.
115,,
116,,"There were slaves who dragged the shackles of a precedent unbroken,"
117,,"Demonstrating the fulfilment of unalterable schemes,"
118,,"Which had been, before the cradle, Time's inexorable tenants"
119,,Of what were now the dusty ruins of their father's dreams.
120,,"There were these, and there were many who had stumbled up to manhood,"
121,,Where they saw too late the road they should have taken long ago:
122,,"There were thwarted clerks and fiddlers in the Valley of the Shadow,"
123,,The commemorative wreckage of what others did not know.
124,,
125,,"And there were daughters older than the mothers who had borne them,"
126,,"Being older in their wisdom, which is older than the earth;"
127,,"And they were going forward only farther into darkness,"
128,,Unrelieved as were the blasting obligations of their birth;
129,,"And among them, giving always what was not for their possession,"
130,,"There were maidens, very quiet, with no quiet in their eyes:"
131,,"There were daughters of the silence in the Valley of the Shadow,"
132,,Each an isolated item in the family sacrifice.
133,,
134,,"There were creepers among catacombs where dull regrets were torches,"
135,,Giving light enough to show them what was there upon the shelves --
136,,Where there was more for them to see than pleasure would remember
137,,Of something that had been alive and once had been themselves.
138,,"There were some who stirred the ruins with a solid imprecation,"
139,,While as many fled repentance for the promise of despair:
140,,"There were drinkers of wrong waters in the Valley of the Shadow,"
141,,And all the sparkling ways were dust that once had led them there.
142,,
143,,"There were some who knew the steps of Age incredibly beside them,"
144,,And his fingers upon shoulders that had never felt the wheel;
145,,"And their last of empty trophies was a gilded cup of nothing,"
146,,Which a contemplating vagabond would not have come to steal.
147,,"Long and often had they figured for a larger valuation,"
148,,But the size of their addition was the balance of a doubt:
149,,"There were gentlemen of leisure in the Valley of the Shadow,"
150,,"Not allured by retrospection, disenchanted, and played out."
151,,
152,,And among the dark endurances of unavowed reprisals
153,,There were silent eyes of envy that saw little but saw well;
154,,And over beauty's aftermath of hazardous ambitions
155,,There were tears for what had vanished as they vanished where they fell.
156,,"Not assured of what was theirs, and always hungry for the nameless,"
157,,There were some whose only passion was for Time who made them cold:
158,,"There were numerous fair women in the Valley of the Shadow,"
159,,Dreaming rather less of heaven than of hell when they were old.
160,,
161,,"Now and then, as if to scorn the common touch of common sorrow,"
162,,There were some who gave a few the distant pity of a smile;
163,,"And another cloaked a soul as with an ash of human embers,"
164,,Having covered thus a treasure that would last him for a while.
165,,"There were many by the presence of the many disaffected,"
166,,Whose exemption was included in the weight that others bore:
167,,"There were seekers after darkness in the Valley of the Shadow,"
168,,And they alone were there to find what they were looking for.
169,,
170,,"So they were, and so they are; and as they came are coming others,"
171,,And among them are the fearless and the meek and the unborn;
172,,And a question that has held us heretofore without an answer
173,,May abide without an answer until all have ceased to mourn.
174,,"For the children of the dark are more to name than are the wretched,"
175,,"Or the broken, or the weary, or the baffled, or the shamed:"
176,,"There are builders of new mansions in the Valley of the Shadow,"
177,,And among them are the dying and the blinded and the maimed.
178,,
179,,
180,,
181,,
182,,The Wandering Jew
183,,
184,,I saw by looking in his eyes
185,,That they remembered everything;
186,,And this was how I came to know
187,,"That he was here, still wandering."
188,,For though the figure and the scene
189,,"Were never to be reconciled,"
190,,I knew the man as I had known
191,,His image when I was a child.
192,,
193,,"With evidence at every turn,"
194,,I should have held it safe to guess
195,,That all the newness of New York
196,,Had nothing new in loneliness;
197,,"Yet here was one who might be Noah,"
198,,"Or Nathan, or Abimelech,"
199,,"Or Lamech, out of ages lost, --"
200,,"Or, more than all, Melchizedek."
201,,
202,,"Assured that he was none of these,"
203,,"I gave them back their names again,"
204,,To scan once more those endless eyes
205,,Where all my questions ended then.
206,,I found in them what they revealed
207,,"That I shall not live to forget,"
208,,And wondered if they found in mine
209,,Compassion that I might regret.
210,,
211,,"Pity, I learned, was not the least"
212,,Of time's offending benefits
213,,That had now for so long impugned
214,,The conservation of his wits:
215,,"Rather it was that I should yield,"
216,,"Alone, the fealty that presents"
217,,The tribute of a tempered ear
218,,To an untempered eloquence.
219,,
220,,Before I pondered long enough
221,,"On whence he came and who he was,"
222,,I trembled at his ringing wealth
223,,Of manifold anathemas;
224,,"I wondered, while he seared the world,"
225,,"What new defection ailed the race,"
226,,And if it mattered how remote
227,,Our fathers were from such a place.
228,,
229,,Before there was an hour for me
230,,To contemplate with less concern
231,,The crumbling realm awaiting us
232,,"Than his that was beyond return,"
233,,A dawning on the dust of years
234,,Had shaped with an elusive light
235,,Mirages of remembered scenes
236,,That were no longer for the sight.
237,,
238,,For now the gloom that hid the man
239,,"Became a daylight on his wrath,"
240,,And one wherein my fancy viewed
241,,New lions ramping in his path.
242,,"The old were dead and had no fangs,"
243,,Wherefore he loved them -- seeing not
244,,They were the same that in their time
245,,Had eaten everything they caught.
246,,
247,,The world around him was a gift
248,,"Of anguish to his eyes and ears,"
249,,And one that he had long reviled
250,,"As fit for devils, not for seers."
251,,"Where, then, was there a place for him"
252,,That on this other side of death
253,,"Saw nothing good, as he had seen"
254,,No good come out of Nazareth?
255,,
256,,"Yet here there was a reticence,"
257,,"And I believe his only one,"
258,,That hushed him as if he beheld
259,,A Presence that would not be gone.
260,,In such a silence he confessed
261,,How much there was to be denied;
262,,"And he would look at me and live,"
263,,As others might have looked and died.
264,,
265,,As if at last he knew again
266,,"That he had always known, his eyes"
267,,Were like to those of one who gazed
268,,On those of One who never dies.
269,,For such a moment he revealed
270,,What life has in it to be lost;
271,,"And I could ask if what I saw,"
272,,"Before me there, was man or ghost."
273,,
274,,He may have died so many times
275,,That all there was of him to see
276,,"Was pride, that kept itself alive"
277,,As too rebellious to be free;
278,,"He may have told, when more than once"
279,,"Humility seemed imminent,"
280,,How many a lonely time in vain
281,,The Second Coming came and went.
282,,
283,,Whether he still defies or not
284,,The failure of an angry task
285,,That relegates him out of time
286,,"To chaos, I can only ask."
287,,"But as I knew him, so he was;"
288,,And somewhere among men to-day
289,,"Those old, unyielding eyes may flash,"
290,,And flinch -- and look the other way.
291,,
292,,
293,,
294,,
295,,Neighbors
296,,
297,,"As often as we thought of her,"
298,,We thought of a gray life
299,,That made a quaint economist
300,,Of a wolf-haunted wife;
301,,We made the best of all she bore
302,,"That was not ours to bear,"
303,,And honored her for wearing things
304,,That were not things to wear.
305,,
306,,There was a distance in her look
307,,That made us look again;
308,,"And if she smiled, we might believe"
309,,That we had looked in vain.
310,,"Rarely she came inside our doors,"
311,,And had not long to stay;
312,,"And when she left, it seemed somehow"
313,,That she was far away.
314,,
315,,"At last, when we had all forgot"
316,,"That all is here to change,"
317,,A shadow on the commonplace
318,,Was for a moment strange.
319,,"Yet there was nothing for surprise,"
320,,Nor much that need be told:
321,,"Love, with his gift of pain, had given"
322,,More than one heart could hold.
323,,
324,,
325,,
326,,
327,,The Mill
328,,
329,,"The miller's wife had waited long,"
330,,"The tea was cold, the fire was dead;"
331,,And there might yet be nothing wrong
332,,In how he went and what he said:
333,,"""There are no millers any more,"""
334,,Was all that she had heard him say;
335,,And he had lingered at the door
336,,So long that it seemed yesterday.
337,,
338,,Sick with a fear that had no form
339,,She knew that she was there at last;
340,,And in the mill there was a warm
341,,And mealy fragrance of the past.
342,,What else there was would only seem
343,,To say again what he had meant;
344,,And what was hanging from a beam
345,,Would not have heeded where she went.
346,,
347,,"And if she thought it followed her,"
348,,She may have reasoned in the dark
349,,That one way of the few there were
350,,Would hide her and would leave no mark:
351,,"Black water, smooth above the weir"
352,,"Like starry velvet in the night,"
353,,"Though ruffled once, would soon appear"
354,,The same as ever to the sight.
355,,
356,,
357,,
358,,
359,,The Dark Hills
360,,
361,,"Dark hills at evening in the west,"
362,,Where sunset hovers like a sound
363,,Of golden horns that sang to rest
364,,"Old bones of warriors under ground,"
365,,Far now from all the bannered ways
366,,"Where flash the legions of the sun,"
367,,You fade -- as if the last of days
368,,"Were fading, and all wars were done."
369,,
370,,
371,,
372,,
373,,The Three Taverns
374,,
375,,"When the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us"
376,,"as far as Appii Forum, and The Three Taverns."
377,,(Acts 28:15)
378,,
379,,"Herodion, Apelles, Amplias,"
380,,And Andronicus?  Is it you I see --
381,,At last?  And is it you now that are gazing
382,,As if in doubt of me?  Was I not saying
383,,That I should come to Rome?  I did say that;
384,,And I said furthermore that I should go
385,,"On westward, where the gateway of the world"
386,,"Lets in the central sea.  I did say that,"
387,,"But I say only, now, that I am Paul --"
388,,"A prisoner of the Law, and of the Lord"
389,,A voice made free.  If there be time enough
390,,"To live, I may have more to tell you then"
391,,"Of western matters.  I go now to Rome,"
392,,"Where Caesar waits for me, and I shall wait,"
393,,And Caesar knows how long.  In Caesarea
394,,There was a legend of Agrippa saying
395,,"In a light way to Festus, having heard"
396,,"My deposition, that I might be free,"
397,,Had I stayed free of Caesar; but the word
398,,Of God would have it as you see it is --
399,,And here I am.  The cup that I shall drink
400,,Is mine to drink -- the moment or the place
401,,"Not mine to say.  If it be now in Rome,"
402,,Be it now in Rome; and if your faith exceed
403,,"The shadow cast of hope, say not of me"
404,,"Too surely or too soon that years and shipwreck,"
405,,And all the many deserts I have crossed
406,,"That are not named or regioned, have undone"
407,,Beyond the brevities of our mortal healing
408,,The part of me that is the least of me.
409,,You see an older man than he who fell
410,,"Prone to the earth when he was nigh Damascus,"
411,,Where the great light came down; yet I am he
412,,"That fell, and he that saw, and he that heard."
413,,"And I am here, at last; and if at last"
414,,I give myself to make another crumb
415,,For this pernicious feast of time and men --
416,,"Well, I have seen too much of time and men"
417,,To fear the ravening or the wrath of either.
418,,
419,,"Yes, it is Paul you see -- the Saul of Tarsus"
420,,"That was a fiery Jew, and had men slain"
421,,"For saying Something was beyond the Law,"
422,,And in ourselves.  I fed my suffering soul
423,,"Upon the Law till I went famishing,"
424,,"Not knowing that I starved.  How should I know,"
425,,"More then than any, that the food I had --"
426,,What else it may have been -- was not for me?
427,,My fathers and their fathers and their fathers
428,,"Had found it good, and said there was no other,"
429,,"And I was of the line.  When Stephen fell,"
430,,"Among the stones that crushed his life away,"
431,,There was no place alive that I could see
432,,For such a man.  Why should a man be given
433,,"To live beyond the Law?  So I said then,"
434,,As men say now to me.  How then do I
435,,Persist in living?  Is that what you ask?
436,,"If so, let my appearance be for you"
437,,No living answer; for Time writes of death
438,,"On men before they die, and what you see"
439,,Is not the man.  The man that you see not --
440,,The man within the man -- is most alive;
441,,"Though hatred would have ended, long ago,"
442,,"The bane of his activities.  I have lived,"
443,,Because the faith within me that is life
444,,"Endures to live, and shall, till soon or late,"
445,,"Death, like a friend unseen, shall say to me"
446,,My toil is over and my work begun.
447,,
448,,"How often, and how many a time again,"
449,,Have I said I should be with you in Rome!
450,,"He who is always coming never comes,"
451,,"Or comes too late, you may have told yourselves;"
452,,"And I may tell you now that after me,"
453,,"Whether I stay for little or for long,"
454,,"The wolves are coming.  Have an eye for them,"
455,,And a more careful ear for their confusion
456,,Than you need have much longer for the sound
457,,Of what I tell you -- should I live to say
458,,More than I say to Caesar.  What I know
459,,Is down for you to read in what is written;
460,,And if I cloud a little with my own
461,,"Mortality the gleam that is immortal,"
462,,I do it only because I am I --
463,,"Being on earth and of it, in so far"
464,,As time flays yet the remnant.  This you know;
465,,"And if I sting men, as I do sometimes,"
466,,"With a sharp word that hurts, it is because"
467,,Man's habit is to feel before he sees;
468,,"And I am of a race that feels.  Moreover,"
469,,The world is here for what is not yet here
470,,"For more than are a few; and even in Rome,"
471,,Where men are so enamored of the Cross
472,,"That fame has echoed, and increasingly,"
473,,The music of your love and of your faith
474,,To foreign ears that are as far away
475,,"As Antioch and Haran, yet I wonder"
476,,"How much of love you know, and if your faith"
477,,"Be the shut fruit of words.  If so, remember"
478,,Words are but shells unfilled.  Jews have at least
479,,A Law to make them sorry they were born
480,,"If they go long without it; and these Gentiles,"
481,,"For the first time in shrieking history,"
482,,"Have love and law together, if so they will,"
483,,For their defense and their immunity
484,,"In these last days.  Rome, if I know the name,"
485,,Will have anon a crown of thorns and fire
486,,"Made ready for the wreathing of new masters,"
487,,"Of whom we are appointed, you and I, --"
488,,"And you are still to be when I am gone,"
489,,"Should I go presently.  Let the word fall,"
490,,"Meanwhile, upon the dragon-ridden field"
491,,"Of circumstance, either to live or die;"
492,,"Concerning which there is a parable,"
493,,Made easy for the comfort and attention
494,,"Of those who preach, fearing they preach in vain."
495,,"You are to plant, and then to plant again"
496,,"Where you have gathered, gathering as you go;"
497,,"For you are in the fields that are eternal,"
498,,And you have not the burden of the Lord
499,,Upon your mortal shoulders.  What you have
500,,"Is a light yoke, made lighter by the wearing,"
501,,Till it shall have the wonder and the weight
502,,"Of a clear jewel, shining with a light"
503,,Wherein the sun and all the fiery stars
504,,May soon be fading.  When Gamaliel said
505,,"That if they be of men these things are nothing,"
506,,But if they be of God they are for none
507,,"To overthrow, he spoke as a good Jew,"
508,,And one who stayed a Jew; and he said all.
509,,"And you know, by the temper of your faith,"
510,,How far the fire is in you that I felt
511,,"Before I knew Damascus.  A word here,"
512,,"Or there, or not there, or not anywhere,"
513,,Is not the Word that lives and is the life;
514,,"And you, therefore, need weary not yourselves"
515,,With jealous aches of others.  If the world
516,,"Were not a world of aches and innovations,"
517,,Attainment would have no more joy of it.
518,,"There will be creeds and schisms, creeds in creeds,"
519,,And schisms in schisms; myriads will be done
520,,"To death because a farthing has two sides,"
521,,"And is at last a farthing.  Telling you this,"
522,,"I, who bid men to live, appeal to Caesar."
523,,"Once I had said the ways of God were dark,"
524,,Meaning by that the dark ways of the Law.
525,,Such is the glory of our tribulations;
526,,"For the Law kills the flesh that kills the Law,"
527,,And we are then alive.  We have eyes then;
528,,And we have then the Cross between two worlds --
529,,"To guide us, or to blind us for a time,"
530,,Till we have eyes indeed.  The fire that smites
531,,"A few on highways, changing all at once,"
532,,Is not for all.  The power that holds the world
533,,Away from God that holds himself away --
534,,Farther away than all your works and words
535,,Are like to fly without the wings of faith --
536,,"Was not, nor ever shall be, a small hazard"
537,,Enlivening the ways of easy leisure
538,,Or the cold road of knowledge.  When our eyes
539,,"Have wisdom, we see more than we remember;"
540,,And the old world of our captivities
541,,"May then become a smitten glimpse of ruin,"
542,,Like one where vanished hewers have had their day
543,,"Of wrath on Lebanon.  Before we see,"
544,,"Meanwhile, we suffer; and I come to you,"
545,,"At last, through many storms and through much night."
546,,
547,,"Yet whatsoever I have undergone,"
548,,My keepers in this instance are not hard.
549,,"But for the chance of an ingratitude,"
550,,"I might indeed be curious of their mercy,"
551,,"And fearful of their leisure while I wait,"
552,,"A few leagues out of Rome.  Men go to Rome,"
553,,Not always to return -- but not that now.
554,,"Meanwhile, I seem to think you look at me"
555,,With eyes that are at last more credulous
556,,Of my identity.  You remark in me
557,,"No sort of leaping giant, though some words"
558,,Of mine to you from Corinth may have leapt
559,,A little through your eyes into your soul.
560,,"I trust they were alive, and are alive"
561,,Today; for there be none that shall indite
562,,So much of nothing as the man of words
563,,Who writes in the Lord's name for his name's sake
564,,And has not in his blood the fire of time
565,,To warm eternity.  Let such a man --
566,,If once the light is in him and endures --
567,,"Content himself to be the general man,"
568,,Set free to sift the decencies and thereby
569,,"To learn, except he be one set aside"
570,,"For sorrow, more of pleasure than of pain;"
571,,"Though if his light be not the light indeed,"
572,,"But a brief shine that never really was,"
573,,"And fails, leaving him worse than where he was,"
574,,Then shall he be of all men destitute.
575,,"And here were not an issue for much ink,"
576,,Or much offending faction among scribes.
577,,
578,,"The Kingdom is within us, we are told;"
579,,And when I say to you that we possess it
580,,"In such a measure as faith makes it ours,"
581,,I say it with a sinner's privilege
582,,"Of having seen and heard, and seen again,"
583,,After a darkness; and if I affirm
584,,To the last hour that faith affords alone
585,,"The Kingdom entrance and an entertainment,"
586,,I do not see myself as one who says
587,,To man that he shall sit with folded hands
588,,"Against the Coming.  If I be anything,"
589,,"I move a driven agent among my kind,"
590,,"Establishing by the faith of Abraham,"
591,,"And by the grace of their necessities,"
592,,The clamoring word that is the word of life
593,,Nearer than heretofore to the solution
594,,Of their tomb-serving doubts.  If I have loosed
595,,A shaft of language that has flown sometimes
596,,A little higher than the hearts and heads
597,,"Of nature's minions, it will yet be heard,"
598,,Like a new song that waits for distant ears.
599,,I cannot be the man that I am not;
600,,"And while I own that earth is my affliction,"
601,,"I am a man of earth, who says not all"
602,,"To all alike.  That were impossible,"
603,,Even as it were so that He should plant
604,,A larger garden first.  But you today
605,,"Are for the larger sowing; and your seed,"
606,,"A little mixed, will have, as He foresaw,"
607,,"The foreign harvest of a wider growth,"
608,,"And one without an end.  Many there are,"
609,,"And are to be, that shall partake of it,"
610,,Though none may share it with an understanding
611,,That is not his alone.  We are all alone;
612,,And yet we are all parcelled of one order --
613,,"Jew, Gentile, or barbarian in the dark"
614,,Of wildernesses that are not so much
615,,"As names yet in a book.  And there are many,"
616,,"Finding at last that words are not the Word,"
617,,"And finding only that, will flourish aloft,"
618,,"Like heads of captured Pharisees on pikes,"
619,,Our contradictions and discrepancies;
620,,And there are many more will hang themselves
621,,"Upon the letter, seeing not in the Word"
622,,"The friend of all who fail, and in their faith"
623,,A sword of excellence to cut them down.
624,,
625,,As long as there are glasses that are dark --
626,,And there are many -- we see darkly through them;
627,,All which have I conceded and set down
628,,In words that have no shadow.  What is dark
629,,"Is dark, and we may not say otherwise;"
630,,Yet what may be as dark as a lost fire
631,,"For one of us, may still be for another"
632,,"A coming gleam across the gulf of ages,"
633,,And a way home from shipwreck to the shore;
634,,"And so, through pangs and ills and desperations,"
635,,There may be light for all.  There shall be light.
636,,"As much as that, you know.  You cannot say"
637,,This woman or that man will be the next
638,,On whom it falls; you are not here for that.
639,,Your ministration is to be for others
640,,The firing of a rush that may for them
641,,Be soon the fire itself.  The few at first
642,,Are fighting for the multitude at last;
643,,Therefore remember what Gamaliel said
644,,"Before you, when the sick were lying down"
645,,In streets all night for Peter's passing shadow.
646,,"Fight, and say what you feel; say more than words."
647,,Give men to know that even their days of earth
648,,To come are more than ages that are gone.
649,,"Say what you feel, while you have time to say it."
650,,"Eternity will answer for itself,"
651,,Without your intercession; yet the way
652,,"For many is a long one, and as dark,"
653,,"Meanwhile, as dreams of hell.  See not your toil"
654,,"Too much, and if I be away from you,"
655,,"Think of me as a brother to yourselves,"
656,,"Of many blemishes.  Beware of stoics,"
657,,And give your left hand to grammarians;
658,,"And when you seem, as many a time you may,"
659,,"To have no other friend than hope, remember"
660,,"That you are not the first, or yet the last."
661,,
662,,"The best of life, until we see beyond"
663,,The shadows of ourselves (and they are less
664,,Than even the blindest of indignant eyes
665,,Would have them) is in what we do not know.
666,,"Make, then, for all your fears a place to sleep"
667,,With all your faded sins; nor think yourselves
668,,Egregious and alone for your defects
669,,Of youth and yesterday.  I was young once;
670,,And there's a question if you played the fool
671,,With a more fervid and inherent zeal
672,,"Than I have in my story to remember,"
673,,"Or gave your necks to folly's conquering foot,"
674,,"Or flung yourselves with an unstudied aim,"
675,,Less frequently than I.  Never mind that.
676,,"Man's little house of days will hold enough,"
677,,"Sometimes, to make him wish it were not his,"
678,,But it will not hold all.  Things that are dead
679,,"Are best without it, and they own their death"
680,,"By virtue of their dying.  Let them go, --"
681,,"But think you not the world is ashes yet,"
682,,And you have all the fire.  The world is here
683,,"Today, and it may not be gone tomorrow;"
684,,"For there are millions, and there may be more,"
685,,To make in turn a various estimation
686,,"Of its old ills and ashes, and the traps"
687,,Of its apparent wrath.  Many with ears
688,,"That hear not yet, shall have ears given to them,"
689,,And then they shall hear strangely.  Many with eyes
690,,That are incredulous of the Mystery
691,,"Shall yet be driven to feel, and then to read"
692,,"Where language has an end and is a veil,"
693,,Not woven of our words.  Many that hate
694,,Their kind are soon to know that without love
695,,Their faith is but the perjured name of nothing.
696,,I that have done some hating in my time
697,,"See now no time for hate; I that have left,"
698,,Fading behind me like familiar lights
699,,"That are to shine no more for my returning,"
700,,"Home, friends, and honors, -- I that have lost all else"
701,,"For wisdom, and the wealth of it, say now"
702,,"To you that out of wisdom has come love,"
703,,That measures and is of itself the measure
704,,Of works and hope and faith.  Your longest hours
705,,Are not so long that you may torture them
706,,And harass not yourselves; and the last days
707,,"Are on the way that you prepare for them,"
708,,"And was prepared for you, here in a world"
709,,"Where you have sinned and suffered, striven and seen."
710,,If you be not so hot for counting them
711,,"Before they come that you consume yourselves,"
712,,Peace may attend you all in these last days --
713,,"And me, as well as you.  Yes, even in Rome."
714,,"Well, I have talked and rested, though I fear"
715,,"My rest has not been yours; in which event,"
716,,Forgive one who is only seven leagues
717,,"From Caesar.  When I told you I should come,"
718,,I did not see myself the criminal
719,,"You contemplate, for seeing beyond the Law"
720,,"That which the Law saw not.  But this, indeed,"
721,,"Was good of you, and I shall not forget;"
722,,"No, I shall not forget you came so far"
723,,"To meet a man so dangerous.  Well, farewell."
724,,They come to tell me I am going now --
725,,"With them.  I hope that we shall meet again,"
726,,But none may say what he shall find in Rome.

737,,"Beware, I say, the failure and the shame"

760,,To you that are outside and are to be

763,,Rather be then your prayer that you shall have
764,,"Your kingdom undishonored.  Having all,"
765,,"See not the great among you for the small,"

783,,On seas that have no name.

841,,"in American history, may be supposed to have occurred a few months previous"
842,,to Hamilton's retirement from Washington's Cabinet in 1795
843,,and a few years before the political ingenuities of Burr --
844,,"who has been characterized, without much exaggeration,"
845,,as the inventor of American politics -- began to be conspicuously formidable
846,,"to the Federalists.  These activities on the part of Burr resulted,"
847,,"as the reader will remember, in the Burr-Jefferson tie for the Presidency"
848,,"in 1800, and finally in the Burr-Hamilton duel at Weehawken in 1804."

854,BURR,"Hamilton, if he rides you down, remember"

856,BURR,Your fabric from catastrophe.  That's good;
857,BURR,For I perceive that you observe him also.
858,BURR,"A President, a-riding of his horse,"
859,BURR,May dust a General and be forgiven;
860,BURR,"But why be dusted -- when we're all alike,"
861,BURR,"All equal, and all happy.  Here he comes --"
862,BURR,"And there he goes.  And we, by your new patent,"
863,BURR,"Would seem to be two kings here by the wayside,"
864,BURR,With our two hats off to his Excellency.
865,BURR,"Why not his Majesty, and done with it?"
866,BURR,"Forgive me if I shook your meditation,"

874,HAMILTON,A care for me; wherefore my gratitude
875,HAMILTON,For your attention is commensurate
876,HAMILTON,"With your concern.  Yes, Burr, we are two kings;"
877,HAMILTON,We are as royal as two ditch-diggers;
878,HAMILTON,But owe me not your sceptre.  These are the days
879,HAMILTON,"When first a few seem all; but if we live,"
880,HAMILTON,We may again be seen to be the few
881,HAMILTON,That we have always been.  These are the days

901,BURR,
902,BURR,Never a doubt.  But what you hear the most

905,BURR,"I seem to hear you ask, are men to dance,"
906,BURR,"When all men are musicians.  Tell me that,"
907,BURR,"I hear you saying, and I'll tell you the name"
908,BURR,Of Samson's mother.  But why shroud yourself
909,BURR,"Before the coffin comes?  For all you know,"
910,BURR,The tree that is to fall for your last house
911,BURR,Is now a sapling.  You may have to wait
912,BURR,"So long as to be sorry; though I doubt it,"
913,BURR,For you are not at home in your new Eden
914,BURR,Where chilly whispers of a likely frost
915,BURR,Accumulate already in the air.
916,BURR,"I think a touch of ermine, Hamilton,"

954,HAMILTON,"There was a nation in the man who passed us,"
955,HAMILTON,If there was not a world.  I may have driven
956,HAMILTON,"Since then some restive horses, and alone,"

968,BURR,I have forgotten what my father said
969,BURR,"When I was born, but there's a rustling of it"
970,BURR,"Among my memories, and it makes a noise"
971,BURR,About as loud as all that I have held
972,BURR,And fondled heretofore of your same caution.
973,BURR,"But that's affairs, not feelings.  If our friends"
974,BURR,"Guessed half we say of them, our enemies"
975,BURR,"Would itch in our friends' jackets.  Howsoever,"
976,BURR,"The world is of a sudden on its head,"
977,BURR,And all are spilled -- unless you cling alone

1047,HAMILTON,There might be fewer ditches dug for others
1048,HAMILTON,In your perspective; and there might be fewer
1049,HAMILTON,Contemporary motes of prejudice
1050,HAMILTON,Between you and the man who made the dust.
1051,HAMILTON,"Call him a genius or a gentleman,"
1052,HAMILTON,"A prophet or a builder, or what not,"
1053,HAMILTON,"But hold your disposition off the balance,"
1054,HAMILTON,And weigh him in the light.  Once (I believe
1055,HAMILTON,"I tell you nothing new to your surmise,"
1056,HAMILTON,Or to the tongues of towns and villages)
1057,HAMILTON,I nourished with an adolescent fancy --
1058,HAMILTON,"Surely forgivable to you, my friend --"
1059,HAMILTON,An innocent and amiable conviction
1060,HAMILTON,"That I was, by the grace of honest fortune,"
1061,HAMILTON,"A savior at his elbow through the war,"
1062,HAMILTON,"Where I might have observed, more than I did,"
1063,HAMILTON,"Patience and wholesome passion.  I was there,"
1064,HAMILTON,And for such honor I gave nothing worse
1065,HAMILTON,Than some advice at which he may have smiled.
1066,HAMILTON,"I must have given a modicum besides,"
1067,HAMILTON,Or the rough interval between those days
1068,HAMILTON,"And these would never have made for me my friends,"
1069,HAMILTON,Or enemies.  I should be something somewhere --
1070,HAMILTON,I say not what -- but I should not be here
1071,HAMILTON,"If he had not been there.  Possibly, too,"
1072,HAMILTON,You might not -- or that Quaker with his cane.
1073,HAMILTON,

1081,HAMILTON,HAMILTON
1082,HAMILTON,
1083,HAMILTON,"It was a man, Burr, that was in my mind;"
1084,HAMILTON,"No god, or ghost, or demon -- only a man:"
1085,HAMILTON,A man whose occupation is the need
1086,HAMILTON,Of those who would not feel it if it bit them;
1087,HAMILTON,And one who shapes an age while he endures
1088,HAMILTON,The pin pricks of inferiorities;
1089,HAMILTON,"A cautious man, because he is but one;"
1090,HAMILTON,"A lonely man, because he is a thousand."
1091,HAMILTON,No marvel you are slow to find in him
1092,HAMILTON,The genius that is one spark or is nothing:
1093,HAMILTON,His genius is a flame that he must hold
1094,HAMILTON,So far above the common heads of men
1095,HAMILTON,That they may view him only through the mist
1096,HAMILTON,"Of their defect, and wonder what he is."
1097,HAMILTON,It seems to me the mystery that is in him
1098,HAMILTON,That makes him only more to me a man
1099,HAMILTON,Than any other I have ever known.
1100,HAMILTON,

1104,BURR,I grant you that his worship is a man.
1105,BURR,"I'm not so much at home with mysteries,"
1106,BURR,"May be, as you -- so leave him with his fire:"
1107,BURR,God knows that I shall never put it out.
1108,BURR,He has not made a cripple of himself
1109,BURR,"In his pursuit of me, though I have heard"
1110,BURR,His condescension honors me with parts.
1111,BURR,"Parts make a whole, if we've enough of them;"
1112,BURR,And once I figured a sufficiency
1113,BURR,To be at least an atom in the annals
1114,BURR,Of your republic.  But I must have erred.
1115,BURR,
1116,BURR,
1117,HAMILTON,HAMILTON
1118,HAMILTON,
1119,HAMILTON,You smile as if your spirit lived at ease
1120,HAMILTON,"With error.  I should not have named it so,"
1121,HAMILTON,"Failing assent from you; nor, if I did,"
1122,HAMILTON,Should I be so complacent in my skill
1123,HAMILTON,To comb the tangled language of the people
1124,HAMILTON,As to be sure of anything in these days.
1125,HAMILTON,Put that much in account with modesty.

1131,BURR,"Have you, in the last region of your dreaming,"
1132,BURR,"To do with ""people""?  You may be the devil"
1133,BURR,In your dead-reckoning of what reefs and shoals
1134,BURR,Are waiting on the progress of our ship
1135,BURR,"Unless you steer it, but you'll find it irksome"
1136,BURR,Alone there in the stern; and some warm day
1137,BURR,"There'll be an inland music in the rigging,"
1138,BURR,And afterwards on deck.  I'm not affined
1139,BURR,"Or favored overmuch at Monticello,"
1140,BURR,But there's a mighty swarming of new bees
1141,BURR,"About the premises, and all have wings."
1142,BURR,"If you hear something buzzing before long,"
1143,BURR,"Be thoughtful how you strike, remembering also"
1144,BURR,"There was a fellow Naboth had a vineyard,"
1145,BURR,And Ahab cut his hair off and went softly.
1146,BURR,
1147,BURR,
1148,HAMILTON,HAMILTON
1149,HAMILTON,
1150,HAMILTON,I don't remember that he cut his hair off.
1151,HAMILTON,

1153,BURR,BURR
1154,BURR,
1155,BURR,Somehow I rather fancy that he did.
1156,BURR,"If so, it's in the Book; and if not so,"

1161,HAMILTON,
1162,HAMILTON,Commend yourself to Ahab and his ways
1163,HAMILTON,If they inveigle you to emulation;
1164,HAMILTON,"But where, if I may ask it, are you tending"
1165,HAMILTON,With your invidious wielding of the Scriptures?
1166,HAMILTON,You call to mind an eminent archangel
1167,HAMILTON,Who fell to make him famous.  Would you fall
1168,HAMILTON,"So far as he, to be so far remembered?"

1171,BURR,BURR
1172,BURR,
1173,BURR,"Before I fall or rise, or am an angel,"
1174,BURR,I shall acquaint myself a little further
1175,BURR,"With our new land's new language, which is not --"
1176,BURR,Peace to your dreams -- an idiom to your liking.
1177,BURR,I'm wondering if a man may always know
1178,BURR,How old a man may be at thirty-seven;
1179,BURR,I wonder likewise if a prettier time
1180,BURR,Could be decreed for a good man to vanish
1181,BURR,"Than about now for you, before you fade,"
1182,BURR,And even your friends are seeing that you have had
1183,BURR,Your cup too full for longer mortal triumph.
1184,BURR,"Well, you have had enough, and had it young;"
1185,BURR,And the old wine is nearer to the lees
1186,BURR,Than you are to the work that you are doing.

1195,BURR,BURR
1196,BURR,
1197,BURR,"Anon -- that is, already.  Only Fortune"
1198,BURR,Gave me this afternoon the benefaction
1199,BURR,"Of your blue back, which I for love pursued,"
1200,BURR,And in pursuing may have saved your life --
1201,BURR,Also the world a pounding piece of news:
1202,BURR,"Hamilton bites the dust of Washington,"
1203,BURR,"Or rather of his horse.  For you alone,"
1204,BURR,"Or for your fame, I'd wish it might have been so."

1207,HAMILTON,HAMILTON
1208,HAMILTON,
1209,HAMILTON,Not every man among us has a friend

1211,HAMILTON,Are you to diagnose the doubtful case
1212,HAMILTON,Of Demos -- and what for?  Have you a sword
1213,HAMILTON,"For some new Damocles?  If it's for me,"
1214,HAMILTON,"I have lost all official appetite,"
1215,HAMILTON,"And shall have faded, after January,"
1216,HAMILTON,Into the law.  I'm going to New York.

1220,BURR,
1221,BURR,"No matter where you are, one of these days"
1222,BURR,I shall come back to you and tell you something.
1223,BURR,"This Demos, I have heard, has in his wrist"
1224,BURR,A pulse that no two doctors have as yet
1225,BURR,"Counted and found the same, and in his mouth"
1226,BURR,A tongue that has the like alacrity
1227,BURR,For saying or not for saying what most it is
1228,BURR,That pullulates in his ignoble mind.
1229,BURR,"One of these days I shall appear again,"
1230,BURR,To tell you more of him and his opinions;
1231,BURR,"I shall not be so long out of your sight,"
1232,BURR,"Or take myself so far, that I may not,"
1233,BURR,"Like Alcibiades, come back again."

1247,BURR,"I take?  If so, farewell."
1248,BURR,
1249,BURR,
1250,HAMILTON,HAMILTON
1251,HAMILTON,
1252,HAMILTON,Quite so.  Farewell.

1257,HAMILTON,John Brown
1258,HAMILTON,
1259,HAMILTON,Though for your sake I would not have you now
1260,HAMILTON,"So near to me tonight as now you are,"
1261,HAMILTON,God knows how much a stranger to my heart
1262,HAMILTON,Was any cold word that I may have written;
1263,HAMILTON,"And you, poor woman that I made my wife,"
1264,HAMILTON,"You have had more of loneliness, I fear,"
1265,HAMILTON,"Than I -- though I have been the most alone,"
1266,HAMILTON,Even when the most attended.  So it was
1267,HAMILTON,God set the mark of his inscrutable
1268,HAMILTON,"Necessity on one that was to grope,"
1269,HAMILTON,"And serve, and suffer, and withal be glad"
1270,HAMILTON,"For what was his, and is, and is to be,"
1271,HAMILTON,"When his old bones, that are a burden now,"
1272,HAMILTON,Are saying what the man who carried them
1273,HAMILTON,"Had not the power to say.  Bones in a grave,"
1274,HAMILTON,"Cover them as they will with choking earth,"
1275,HAMILTON,"May shout the truth to men who put them there,"
1276,HAMILTON,"More than all orators.  And so, my dear,"
1277,HAMILTON,Since you have cheated wisdom for the sake
1278,HAMILTON,"Of sorrow, let your sorrow be for you,"
1279,HAMILTON,"This last of nights before the last of days,"
1280,HAMILTON,The lying ghost of what there is of me
1281,HAMILTON,That is the most alive.  There is no death
1282,HAMILTON,For me in what they do.  Their death it is
1283,HAMILTON,They should heed most when the sun comes again
1284,HAMILTON,To make them solemn.  There are some I know
1285,HAMILTON,"Whose eyes will hardly see their occupation,"
1286,HAMILTON,For tears in them -- and all for one old man;
1287,HAMILTON,"For some of them will pity this old man,"
1288,HAMILTON,Who took upon himself the work of God
1289,HAMILTON,Because he pitied millions.  That will be
1290,HAMILTON,"For them, I fancy, their compassionate"
1291,HAMILTON,Best way of saying what is best in them
1292,HAMILTON,"To say; for they can say no more than that,"
1293,HAMILTON,And they can do no more than what the dawn
1294,HAMILTON,Of one more day shall give them light enough
1295,HAMILTON,"To do.  But there are many days to be,"
1296,HAMILTON,"And there are many men to give their blood,"
1297,HAMILTON,As I gave mine for them.  May they come soon!
1298,HAMILTON,
1299,HAMILTON,"May they come soon, I say.  And when they come,"
1300,HAMILTON,"May all that I have said unheard be heard,"
1301,HAMILTON,"Proving at last, or maybe not -- no matter --"
1302,HAMILTON,What sort of madness was the part of me
1303,HAMILTON,"That made me strike, whether I found the mark"
1304,HAMILTON,"Or missed it.  Meanwhile, I've a strange content,"
1305,HAMILTON,"A patience, and a vast indifference"
1306,HAMILTON,To what men say of me and what men fear
1307,HAMILTON,"To say.  There was a work to be begun,"
1308,HAMILTON,"And when the Voice, that I have heard so long,"
1309,HAMILTON,Announced as in a thousand silences
1310,HAMILTON,"An end of preparation, I began"
1311,HAMILTON,"The coming work of death which is to be,"
1312,HAMILTON,That life may be.  There is no other way
1313,HAMILTON,Than the old way of war for a new land
1314,HAMILTON,That will not know itself and is tonight
1315,HAMILTON,"A stranger to itself, and to the world"
1316,HAMILTON,A more prodigious upstart among states
1317,HAMILTON,"Than I was among men, and so shall be"
1318,HAMILTON,"Till they are told and told, and told again;"
1319,HAMILTON,"For men are children, waiting to be told,"
1320,HAMILTON,And most of them are children all their lives.
1321,HAMILTON,"The good God in his wisdom had them so,"
1322,HAMILTON,That now and then a madman or a seer
1323,HAMILTON,May shake them out of their complacency
1324,HAMILTON,And shame them into deeds.  The major file
1325,HAMILTON,"See only what their fathers may have seen,"
1326,HAMILTON,Or may have said they saw when they saw nothing.
1327,HAMILTON,I do not say it matters what they saw.
1328,HAMILTON,Now and again to some lone soul or other
1329,HAMILTON,"God speaks, and there is hanging to be done, --"
1330,HAMILTON,As once there was a burning of our bodies
1331,HAMILTON,"Alive, albeit our souls were sorry fuel."
1332,HAMILTON,"But now the fires are few, and we are poised"
1333,HAMILTON,"Accordingly, for the state's benefit,"
1334,HAMILTON,A few still minutes between heaven and earth.
1335,HAMILTON,"The purpose is, when they have seen enough"
1336,HAMILTON,"Of what it is that they are not to see,"
1337,HAMILTON,"To pluck me as an unripe fruit of treason,"
1338,HAMILTON,And then to fling me back to the same earth
1339,HAMILTON,"Of which they are, as I suppose, the flower --"
1340,HAMILTON,Not given to know the riper fruit that waits
1341,HAMILTON,For a more comprehensive harvesting.
1342,HAMILTON,
1343,HAMILTON,"Yes, may they come, and soon.  Again I say,"
1344,HAMILTON,May they come soon! -- before too many of them
1345,HAMILTON,Shall be the bloody cost of our defection.
1346,HAMILTON,"When hell waits on the dawn of a new state,"
1347,HAMILTON,"Better it were that hell should not wait long, --"
1348,HAMILTON,Or so it is I see it who should see
1349,HAMILTON,As far or farther into time tonight
1350,HAMILTON,"Than they who talk and tremble for me now,"
1351,HAMILTON,Or wish me to those everlasting fires
1352,HAMILTON,That are for me no fear.  Too many fires
1353,HAMILTON,Have sought me out and seared me to the bone --
1354,HAMILTON,"Thereby, for all I know, to temper me"
1355,HAMILTON,For what was mine to do.  If I did ill
1356,HAMILTON,"What I did well, let men say I was mad;"
1357,HAMILTON,Or let my name for ever be a question
1358,HAMILTON,That will not sleep in history.  What men say
1359,HAMILTON,"I was will cool no cannon, dull no sword,"
1360,HAMILTON,"Invalidate no truth.  Meanwhile, I was;"
1361,HAMILTON,"And the long train is lighted that shall burn,"
1362,HAMILTON,"Though floods of wrath may drench it, and hot feet"
1363,HAMILTON,May stamp it for a slight time into smoke
1364,HAMILTON,"That shall blaze up again with growing speed,"
1365,HAMILTON,Until at last a fiery crash will come
1366,HAMILTON,"To cleanse and shake a wounded hemisphere,"
1367,HAMILTON,And heal it of a long malignity
1368,HAMILTON,That angry time discredits and disowns.
1369,HAMILTON,Tonight there are men saying many things;
1370,HAMILTON,And some who see life in the last of me
1371,HAMILTON,Will answer first the coming call to death;
1372,HAMILTON,"For death is what is coming, and then life."
1373,HAMILTON,I do not say again for the dull sake
1374,HAMILTON,"Of speech what you have heard me say before,"
1375,HAMILTON,"But rather for the sake of all I am,"
1376,HAMILTON,And all God made of me.  A man to die
1377,HAMILTON,As I do must have done some other work
1378,HAMILTON,"Than man's alone.  I was not after glory,"
1379,HAMILTON,"But there was glory with me, like a friend,"
1380,HAMILTON,"Throughout those crippling years when friends were few,"
1381,HAMILTON,And fearful to be known by their own names
1382,HAMILTON,When mine was vilified for their approval.
1383,HAMILTON,"Yet friends they are, and they did what was given"
1384,HAMILTON,Their will to do; they could have done no more.
1385,HAMILTON,"I was the one man mad enough, it seems,"
1386,HAMILTON,To do my work; and now my work is over.
1387,HAMILTON,"And you, my dear, are not to mourn for me,"
1388,HAMILTON,"Or for your sons, more than a soul should mourn"
1389,HAMILTON,"In Paradise, done with evil and with earth."
1390,HAMILTON,There is not much of earth in what remains
1391,HAMILTON,For you; and what there may be left of it
1392,HAMILTON,For your endurance you shall have at last
1393,HAMILTON,"In peace, without the twinge of any fear"
1394,HAMILTON,For my condition; for I shall be done
1395,HAMILTON,With plans and actions that have heretofore
1396,HAMILTON,Made your days long and your nights ominous
1397,HAMILTON,With darkness and the many distances
1398,HAMILTON,"That were between us.  When the silence comes,"
1399,HAMILTON,I shall in faith be nearer to you then
1400,HAMILTON,Than I am now in fact.  What you see now
1401,HAMILTON,"Is only the outside of an old man,"
1402,HAMILTON,"Older than years have made him.  Let him die,"
1403,HAMILTON,And let him be a thing for little grief.
1404,HAMILTON,"There was a time for service, and he served;"
1405,HAMILTON,And there is no more time for anything
1406,HAMILTON,But a short gratefulness to those who gave
1407,HAMILTON,Their scared allegiance to an enterprise
1408,HAMILTON,That has the name of treason -- which will serve
1409,HAMILTON,As well as any other for the present.
1410,HAMILTON,"There are some deeds of men that have no names,"
1411,HAMILTON,And mine may like as not be one of them.
1412,HAMILTON,I am not looking far for names tonight.
1413,HAMILTON,The King of Glory was without a name
1414,HAMILTON,"Until men gave him one; yet there He was,"
1415,HAMILTON,Before we found Him and affronted Him
1416,HAMILTON,"With numerous ingenuities of evil,"
1417,HAMILTON,"Of which one, with His aid, is to be swept"
1418,HAMILTON,And washed out of the world with fire and blood.
1419,HAMILTON,
1420,HAMILTON,Once I believed it might have come to pass
1421,HAMILTON,With a small cost of blood; but I was dreaming --
1422,HAMILTON,Dreaming that I believed.  The Voice I heard
1423,HAMILTON,"When I left you behind me in the north, --"
1424,HAMILTON,To wait there and to wonder and grow old
1425,HAMILTON,"Of loneliness, -- told only what was best,"
1426,HAMILTON,"And with a saving vagueness, I should know"
1427,HAMILTON,Till I knew more.  And had I known even then --
1428,HAMILTON,"After grim years of search and suffering,"
1429,HAMILTON,So many of them to end as they began --
1430,HAMILTON,After my sickening doubts and estimations
1431,HAMILTON,Of plans abandoned and of new plans vain --
1432,HAMILTON,After a weary delving everywhere
1433,HAMILTON,For men with every virtue but the Vision --
1434,HAMILTON,"Could I have known, I say, before I left you"
1435,HAMILTON,"That summer morning, all there was to know --"
1436,HAMILTON,Even unto the last consuming word
1437,HAMILTON,That would have blasted every mortal answer
1438,HAMILTON,"As lightning would annihilate a leaf,"
1439,HAMILTON,I might have trembled on that summer morning;
1440,HAMILTON,I might have wavered; and I might have failed.
1441,HAMILTON,
1442,HAMILTON,And there are many among men today
1443,HAMILTON,To say of me that I had best have wavered.
1444,HAMILTON,"So has it been, so shall it always be,"
1445,HAMILTON,For those of us who give ourselves to die
1446,HAMILTON,Before we are so parcelled and approved
1447,HAMILTON,As to be slaughtered by authority.
1448,HAMILTON,We do not make so much of what they say
1449,HAMILTON,As they of what our folly says of us;
1450,HAMILTON,"They give us hardly time enough for that,"
1451,HAMILTON,And thereby we gain much by losing little.
1452,HAMILTON,Few are alive to-day with less to lose
1453,HAMILTON,"Than I who tell you this, or more to gain;"
1454,HAMILTON,And whether I speak as one to be destroyed
1455,HAMILTON,"For no good end outside his own destruction,"
1456,HAMILTON,Time shall have more to say than men shall hear
1457,HAMILTON,Between now and the coming of that harvest
1458,HAMILTON,"Which is to come.  Before it comes, I go --"
1459,HAMILTON,By the short road that mystery makes long
1460,HAMILTON,For man's endurance of accomplishment.
1461,HAMILTON,I shall have more to say when I am dead.
1462,HAMILTON,
1463,HAMILTON,
1464,HAMILTON,
1465,HAMILTON,
1466,HAMILTON,The False Gods
1467,HAMILTON,
1468,HAMILTON,"""We are false and evanescent, and aware of our deceit,"
1469,HAMILTON,From the straw that is our vitals to the clay that is our feet.
1470,HAMILTON,"You may serve us if you must, and you shall have your wage of ashes, --"

1523,HAMILTON,"""Trees, yes; but not a service or a joy"

1845,HAMILTON,The cat might have a personality --
1846,HAMILTON,And maybe the same one the Lord left out
1847,HAMILTON,"Of Tasker Norcross, who, for lack of it,"
1848,HAMILTON,Saw the same sun go down year after year;
1849,HAMILTON,All which at last was my discovery.
1850,HAMILTON,"And only mine, so far as evidence"
1851,HAMILTON,Enlightens one more darkness.  You have known
1852,HAMILTON,"All round you, all your days, men who are nothing --"
1853,HAMILTON,"Nothing, I mean, so far as time tells yet"
1854,HAMILTON,Of any other need it has of them
1855,HAMILTON,Than to make sextons hardy -- but no less
1856,HAMILTON,"Are to themselves incalculably something,"
1857,HAMILTON,"And therefore to be cherished.  God, you see,"
1858,HAMILTON,"Being sorry for them in their fashioning,"
1859,HAMILTON,Indemnified them with a quaint esteem
1860,HAMILTON,"Of self, and with illusions long as life."
1861,HAMILTON,"You know them well, and you have smiled at them;"
1862,HAMILTON,"And they, in their serenity, may have had"
1863,HAMILTON,Their time to smile at you.  Blessed are they
1864,HAMILTON,That see themselves for what they never were
1865,HAMILTON,"Or were to be, and are, for their defect,"
1866,HAMILTON,At ease with mirrors and the dim remarks
1867,HAMILTON,"That pass their tranquil ears."""
1868,HAMILTON,
1869,HAMILTON,"""Come, come,"" said I;"
1870,HAMILTON,"""There may be names in your compendium"
1871,HAMILTON,That we are not yet all on fire for shouting.
1872,HAMILTON,"Skin most of us of our mediocrity,"
1873,HAMILTON,We should have nothing then that we could scratch.
1874,HAMILTON,"The picture smarts.  Cover it, if you please,"
1875,HAMILTON,"And do so rather gently.  Now for Norcross."""
1876,HAMILTON,
1877,HAMILTON,"Ferguson closed his eyes in resignation,"
1878,HAMILTON,"While a dead sigh came out of him.  ""Good God!"""
1879,HAMILTON,"He said, and said it only half aloud,"
1880,HAMILTON,"As if he knew no longer now, nor cared,"
1881,HAMILTON,"If one were there to listen:  ""Have I said nothing --"
1882,HAMILTON,Nothing at all -- of Norcross?  Do you mean
1883,HAMILTON,To patronize him till his name becomes
1884,HAMILTON,A toy made out of letters?  If a name
1885,HAMILTON,"Is all you need, arrange an honest column"
1886,HAMILTON,Of all the people you have ever known
1887,HAMILTON,That you have never liked.  You'll have enough;
1888,HAMILTON,"And you'll have mine, moreover.  No, not yet."
1889,HAMILTON,"If I assume too many privileges,"
1890,HAMILTON,"I pay, and I alone, for their assumption;"
1891,HAMILTON,"By which, if I assume a darker knowledge"
1892,HAMILTON,"Of Norcross than another, let the weight"
1893,HAMILTON,Of my injustice aggravate the load
1894,HAMILTON,That is not on your shoulders.  When I came
1895,HAMILTON,"To know this fellow Norcross in his house,"
1896,HAMILTON,I found him as I found him in the street --
1897,HAMILTON,"No more, no less; indifferent, but no better."
1898,HAMILTON,`Worse' were not quite the word:  he was not bad;
1899,HAMILTON,"He was not . . . well, he was not anything."
1900,HAMILTON,Has your invention ever entertained
1901,HAMILTON,The picture of a dusty worm so dry
1902,HAMILTON,That even the early bird would shake his head
1903,HAMILTON,"And fly on farther for another breakfast?"""
1904,HAMILTON,
1905,HAMILTON,"""But why forget the fortune of the worm,"""
1906,HAMILTON,"I said, ""if in the dryness you deplore"
1907,HAMILTON,Salvation centred and endured?  Your Norcross
1908,HAMILTON,"May have been one for many to have envied."""
1909,HAMILTON,
1910,HAMILTON,"""Salvation?  Fortune?  Would the worm say that?"
1911,HAMILTON,He might; and therefore I dismiss the worm
1912,HAMILTON,"With all dry things but one.  Figures away,"
1913,HAMILTON,Do you begin to see this man a little?
1914,HAMILTON,"Do you begin to see him in the air,"
1915,HAMILTON,With all the vacant horrors of his outline
1916,HAMILTON,For you to fill with more than it will hold?
1917,HAMILTON,"If so, you needn't crown yourself at once"
1918,HAMILTON,With epic laurel if you seem to fill it.
1919,HAMILTON,"Horrors, I say, for in the fires and forks"
1920,HAMILTON,Of a new hell -- if one were not enough --
1921,HAMILTON,I doubt if a new horror would have held him
1922,HAMILTON,With a malignant ingenuity
1923,HAMILTON,More to be feared than his before he died.
1924,HAMILTON,"You smile, as if in doubt.  Well, smile again."
1925,HAMILTON,"Now come into his house, along with me:"
1926,HAMILTON,The four square sombre things that you see first
1927,HAMILTON,Around you are four walls that go as high
1928,HAMILTON,"As to the ceiling.  Norcross knew them well,"
1929,HAMILTON,And he knew others like them.  Fasten to that
1930,HAMILTON,With all the claws of your intelligence;
1931,HAMILTON,And hold the man before you in his house
1932,HAMILTON,"As if he were a white rat in a box,"
1933,HAMILTON,And one that knew himself to be no other.
1934,HAMILTON,"I tell you twice that he knew all about it,"
1935,HAMILTON,That you may not forget the worst of all
1936,HAMILTON,Our tragedies begin with what we know.
1937,HAMILTON,"Could Norcross only not have known, I wonder"
1938,HAMILTON,How many would have blessed and envied him!
1939,HAMILTON,Could he have had the usual eye for spots
1940,HAMILTON,"On others, and for none upon himself,"
1941,HAMILTON,I smile to ponder on the carriages
1942,HAMILTON,That might as well as not have clogged the town
1943,HAMILTON,"In honor of his end.  For there was gold,"
1944,HAMILTON,"You see, though all he needed was a little,"
1945,HAMILTON,And what he gave said nothing of who gave it.
1946,HAMILTON,He would have given it all if in return
1947,HAMILTON,There might have been a more sufficient face
1948,HAMILTON,To greet him when he shaved.  Though you insist
1949,HAMILTON,"It is the dower, and always, of our degree"
1950,HAMILTON,"Not to be cursed with such invidious insight,"
1951,HAMILTON,"Remember that you stand, you and your fancy,"
1952,HAMILTON,"Now in his house; and since we are together,"
1953,HAMILTON,See for yourself and tell me what you see.
1954,HAMILTON,Tell me the best you see.  Make a slight noise
1955,HAMILTON,Of recognition when you find a book
1956,HAMILTON,That you would not as lief read upside down
1957,HAMILTON,"As otherwise, for example.  If there you fail,"
1958,HAMILTON,"Observe the walls and lead me to the place,"
1959,HAMILTON,Where you are led.  If there you meet a picture
1960,HAMILTON,That holds you near it for a longer time
1961,HAMILTON,"Than you are sorry, you may call it yours,"
1962,HAMILTON,"And hang it in the dark of your remembrance,"
1963,HAMILTON,Where Norcross never sees.  How can he see
1964,HAMILTON,"That has no eyes to see?  And as for music,"
1965,HAMILTON,He paid with empty wonder for the pangs
1966,HAMILTON,Of his infrequent forced endurance of it;
1967,HAMILTON,"And having had no pleasure, paid no more"
1968,HAMILTON,"For needless immolation, or for the sight"
1969,HAMILTON,Of those who heard what he was never to hear.
1970,HAMILTON,To see them listening was itself enough
1971,HAMILTON,"To make him suffer; and to watch worn eyes,"
1972,HAMILTON,"On other days, of strangers who forgot"
1973,HAMILTON,Their sorrows and their failures and themselves
1974,HAMILTON,Before a few mysterious odds and ends
1975,HAMILTON,Of marble carted from the Parthenon --
1976,HAMILTON,"And all for seeing what he was never to see,"
1977,HAMILTON,Because it was alive and he was dead --
1978,HAMILTON,Here was a wonder that was more profound
1979,HAMILTON,Than any that was in fiddles and brass horns.
1980,HAMILTON,
1981,HAMILTON,"""He knew, and in his knowledge there was death."
1982,HAMILTON,He knew there was a region all around him
1983,HAMILTON,"That lay outside man's havoc and affairs,"
1984,HAMILTON,"And yet was not all hostile to their tumult,"
1985,HAMILTON,"Where poets would have served and honored him,"
1986,HAMILTON,"And saved him, had there been anything to save."
1987,HAMILTON,"But there was nothing, and his tethered range"
1988,HAMILTON,Was only a small desert.  Kings of song
1989,HAMILTON,Are not for thrones in deserts.  Towers of sound
1990,HAMILTON,And flowers of sense are but a waste of heaven
1991,HAMILTON,Where there is none to know them from the rocks
1992,HAMILTON,And sand-grass of his own monotony
1993,HAMILTON,"That makes earth less than earth.  He could see that,"
1994,HAMILTON,And he could see no more.  The captured light
1995,HAMILTON,"That may have been or not, for all he cared,"
1996,HAMILTON,"The song that is in sculpture was not his,"
1997,HAMILTON,"But only, to his God-forgotten eyes,"
1998,HAMILTON,One more immortal nonsense in a world
1999,HAMILTON,"Where all was mortal, or had best be so,"
2000,HAMILTON,"And so be done with.  `Art,' he would have said,"
2001,HAMILTON,"`Is not life, and must therefore be a lie;'"
2002,HAMILTON,And with a few profundities like that
2003,HAMILTON,He would have controverted and dismissed
2004,HAMILTON,"The benefit of the Greeks.  He had heard of them,"
2005,HAMILTON,As he had heard of his aspiring soul --
2006,HAMILTON,"Never to the perceptible advantage,"
2007,HAMILTON,"In his esteem, of either.  `Faith,' he said,"
2008,HAMILTON,"Or would have said if he had thought of it,"
2009,HAMILTON,"`Lives in the same house with Philosophy,"
2010,HAMILTON,Where the two feed on scraps and are forlorn
2011,HAMILTON,"As orphans after war.  He could see stars,"
2012,HAMILTON,"On a clear night, but he had not an eye"
2013,HAMILTON,"To see beyond them.  He could hear spoken words,"
2014,HAMILTON,But had no ear for silence when alone.
2015,HAMILTON,"He could eat food of which he knew the savor,"
2016,HAMILTON,"But had no palate for the Bread of Life,"
2017,HAMILTON,"That human desperation, to his thinking,"
2018,HAMILTON,"Made famous long ago, having no other."
2019,HAMILTON,"Now do you see?  Do you begin to see?"""
2020,HAMILTON,
2021,HAMILTON,I told him that I did begin to see;
2022,HAMILTON,And I was nearer than I should have been
2023,HAMILTON,"To laughing at his malign inclusiveness,"
2024,HAMILTON,"When I considered that, with all our speed,"
2025,HAMILTON,We are not laughing yet at funerals.
2026,HAMILTON,"I see him now as I could see him then,"
2027,HAMILTON,"And I see now that it was good for me,"
2028,HAMILTON,"As it was good for him, that I was quiet;"
2029,HAMILTON,"For Time's eye was on Ferguson, and the shaft"
2030,HAMILTON,"Of its inquiring hesitancy had touched him,"
2031,HAMILTON,Or so I chose to fancy more than once
2032,HAMILTON,Before he told of Norcross.  When the word
2033,HAMILTON,Of his release (he would have called it so)
2034,HAMILTON,"Made half an inch of news, there were no tears"
2035,HAMILTON,That are recorded.  Women there may have been
2036,HAMILTON,"To wish him back, though I should say, not knowing,"
2037,HAMILTON,"The few there were to mourn were not for love,"
2038,HAMILTON,"And were not lovely.  Nothing of them, at least,"
2039,HAMILTON,Was in the meagre legend that I gathered
2040,HAMILTON,"Years after, when a chance of travel took me"
2041,HAMILTON,So near the region of his nativity
2042,HAMILTON,That a few miles of leisure brought me there;
2043,HAMILTON,For there I found a friendly citizen
2044,HAMILTON,Who led me to his house among the trees
2045,HAMILTON,That were above a railroad and a river.
2046,HAMILTON,Square as a box and chillier than a tomb
2047,HAMILTON,"It was indeed, to look at or to live in --"
2048,HAMILTON,"All which had I been told.  ""Ferguson died,"""
2049,HAMILTON,"The stranger said, ""and then there was an auction."
2050,HAMILTON,"I live here, but I've never yet been warm."
2051,HAMILTON,"Remember him?  Yes, I remember him."
2052,HAMILTON,I knew him -- as a man may know a tree --
2053,HAMILTON,For twenty years.  He may have held himself
2054,HAMILTON,"A little high when he was here, but now . . ."
2055,HAMILTON,"Yes, I remember Ferguson.  Oh, yes."""
2056,HAMILTON,"Others, I found, remembered Ferguson,"
2057,HAMILTON,But none of them had heard of Tasker Norcross.
2058,HAMILTON,
2059,HAMILTON,
2060,HAMILTON,
2061,HAMILTON,
2062,HAMILTON,A Song at Shannon's
2063,HAMILTON,
2064,HAMILTON,Two men came out of Shannon's having known
2065,HAMILTON,The faces of each other for as long
2066,HAMILTON,"As they had listened there to an old song,"
2067,HAMILTON,Sung thinly in a wastrel monotone
2068,HAMILTON,"By some unhappy night-bird, who had flown"
2069,HAMILTON,Too many times and with a wing too strong
2070,HAMILTON,"To save himself, and so done heavy wrong"
2071,HAMILTON,To more frail elements than his alone.
2072,HAMILTON,
2073,HAMILTON,"Slowly away they went, leaving behind"
2074,HAMILTON,More light than was before them.  Neither met
2075,HAMILTON,The other's eyes again or said a word.
2076,HAMILTON,"Each to his loneliness or to his kind,"
2077,HAMILTON,"Went his own way, and with his own regret,"
2078,HAMILTON,Not knowing what the other may have heard.
2079,HAMILTON,
2080,HAMILTON,
2081,HAMILTON,
2082,HAMILTON,
2083,HAMILTON,Souvenir
2084,HAMILTON,
2085,HAMILTON,A vanished house that for an hour I knew
2086,HAMILTON,By some forgotten chance when I was young
2087,HAMILTON,Had once a glimmering window overhung
2088,HAMILTON,With honeysuckle wet with evening dew.
2089,HAMILTON,"Along the path tall dusky dahlias grew,"
2090,HAMILTON,And shadowy hydrangeas reached and swung
2091,HAMILTON,"Ferociously; and over me, among"
2092,HAMILTON,"The moths and mysteries, a blurred bat flew."
2093,HAMILTON,
2094,HAMILTON,Somewhere within there were dim presences
2095,HAMILTON,Of days that hovered and of years gone by.
2096,HAMILTON,"I waited, and between their silences"
2097,HAMILTON,There was an evanescent faded noise;
2098,HAMILTON,"And though a child, I knew it was the voice"
2099,HAMILTON,Of one whose occupation was to die.
2100,HAMILTON,
2101,HAMILTON,
2102,HAMILTON,
2103,HAMILTON,
2104,HAMILTON,Discovery
2105,HAMILTON,
2106,HAMILTON,We told of him as one who should have soared
2107,HAMILTON,And seen for us the devastating light
2108,HAMILTON,"Whereof there is not either day or night,"
2109,HAMILTON,And shared with us the glamour of the Word
2110,HAMILTON,That fell once upon Amos to record
2111,HAMILTON,"For men at ease in Zion, when the sight"
2112,HAMILTON,Of ills obscured aggrieved him and the might
2113,HAMILTON,Of Hamath was a warning of the Lord.
2114,HAMILTON,
2115,HAMILTON,"Assured somehow that he would make us wise,"
2116,HAMILTON,Our pleasure was to wait; and our surprise
2117,HAMILTON,Was hard when we confessed the dry return
2118,HAMILTON,Of his regret.  For we were still to learn
2119,HAMILTON,That earth has not a school where we may go
2120,HAMILTON,"For wisdom, or for more than we may know."
2121,HAMILTON,
2122,HAMILTON,
2123,HAMILTON,
2124,HAMILTON,
2125,HAMILTON,Firelight
2126,HAMILTON,
2127,HAMILTON,"Ten years together without yet a cloud,"
2128,HAMILTON,They seek each other's eyes at intervals
2129,HAMILTON,Of gratefulness to firelight and four walls
2130,HAMILTON,For love's obliteration of the crowd.
2131,HAMILTON,Serenely and perennially endowed
2132,HAMILTON,"And bowered as few may be, their joy recalls"
2133,HAMILTON,"No snake, no sword; and over them there falls"
2134,HAMILTON,The blessing of what neither says aloud.
2135,HAMILTON,
2136,HAMILTON,"Wiser for silence, they were not so glad"
2137,HAMILTON,Were she to read the graven tale of lines
2138,HAMILTON,On the wan face of one somewhere alone;
2139,HAMILTON,Nor were they more content could he have had
2140,HAMILTON,Her thoughts a moment since of one who shines
2141,HAMILTON,"Apart, and would be hers if he had known."
2142,HAMILTON,
2143,HAMILTON,
2144,HAMILTON,
2145,HAMILTON,
2146,HAMILTON,The New Tenants
2147,HAMILTON,
2148,HAMILTON,The day was here when it was his to know
2149,HAMILTON,How fared the barriers he had built between
2150,HAMILTON,"His triumph and his enemies unseen,"
2151,HAMILTON,For them to undermine and overthrow;
2152,HAMILTON,And it was his no longer to forego
2153,HAMILTON,"The sight of them, insidious and serene,"
2154,HAMILTON,Where they were delving always and had been
2155,HAMILTON,Left always to be vicious and to grow.
2156,HAMILTON,
2157,HAMILTON,"And there were the new tenants who had come,"
2158,HAMILTON,"By doors that were left open unawares,"
2159,HAMILTON,"Into his house, and were so much at home"
2160,HAMILTON,"There now that he would hardly have to guess,"
2161,HAMILTON,"By the slow guile of their vindictiveness,"
2162,HAMILTON,What ultimate insolence would soon be theirs.
2163,HAMILTON,
2164,HAMILTON,
2165,HAMILTON,
2166,HAMILTON,
2167,HAMILTON,Inferential
2168,HAMILTON,
2169,HAMILTON,Although I saw before me there the face
2170,HAMILTON,Of one whom I had honored among men
2171,HAMILTON,"The least, and on regarding him again"
2172,HAMILTON,"Would not have had him in another place,"
2173,HAMILTON,He fitted with an unfamiliar grace
2174,HAMILTON,The coffin where I could not see him then
2175,HAMILTON,As I had seen him and appraised him when
2176,HAMILTON,I deemed him unessential to the race.
2177,HAMILTON,
2178,HAMILTON,For there was more of him than what I saw.
2179,HAMILTON,And there was on me more than the old awe
2180,HAMILTON,That is the common genius of the dead.
2181,HAMILTON,"I might as well have heard him:  ""Never mind;"
2182,HAMILTON,"If some of us were not so far behind,"
2183,HAMILTON,"The rest of us were not so far ahead."""
2184,HAMILTON,
2185,HAMILTON,
2186,HAMILTON,
2187,HAMILTON,
2188,HAMILTON,The Rat
2189,HAMILTON,
2190,HAMILTON,As often as he let himself be seen
2191,HAMILTON,"We pitied him, or scorned him, or deplored"
2192,HAMILTON,The inscrutable profusion of the Lord
2193,HAMILTON,Who shaped as one of us a thing so mean --
2194,HAMILTON,Who made him human when he might have been
2195,HAMILTON,"A rat, and so been wholly in accord"
2196,HAMILTON,With any other creature we abhorred
2197,HAMILTON,As always useless and not always clean.
2198,HAMILTON,
2199,HAMILTON,"Now he is hiding all alone somewhere,"
2200,HAMILTON,And in a final hole not ready then;
2201,HAMILTON,For now he is among those over there
2202,HAMILTON,Who are not coming back to us again.
2203,HAMILTON,And we who do the fiction of our share
2204,HAMILTON,Say less of rats and rather more of men.
2205,HAMILTON,
2206,HAMILTON,
2207,HAMILTON,
2208,HAMILTON,
2209,HAMILTON,Rahel to Varnhagen
2210,HAMILTON,
2211,HAMILTON,"Note. --  Rahel Robert and Varnhagen von Ense were married,"
2212,HAMILTON,"after many protestations on her part, in 1814.  The marriage -- so far"
2213,HAMILTON,"as he was concerned, at any rate -- appears to have been satisfactory."
2214,HAMILTON,
2215,HAMILTON,"Now you have read them all; or if not all,"
2216,HAMILTON,As many as in all conscience I should fancy
2217,HAMILTON,To be enough.  There are no more of them --
2218,HAMILTON,"Or none to burn your sleep, or to bring dreams"
2219,HAMILTON,"Of devils.  If these are not sufficient, surely"
2220,HAMILTON,You are a strange young man.  I might live on
2221,HAMILTON,"Alone, and for another forty years,"
2222,HAMILTON,"Or not quite forty, -- are you happier now? --"
2223,HAMILTON,Always to ask if there prevailed elsewhere
2224,HAMILTON,Another like yourself that would have held
2225,HAMILTON,"These aged hands as long as you have held them,"
2226,HAMILTON,"Not once observing, for all I can see,"
2227,HAMILTON,"How they are like your mother's.  Well, you have read"
2228,HAMILTON,"His letters now, and you have heard me say"
2229,HAMILTON,That in them are the cinders of a passion
2230,HAMILTON,That was my life; and you have not yet broken
2231,HAMILTON,"Your way out of my house, out of my sight, --"
2232,HAMILTON,Into the street.  You are a strange young man.
2233,HAMILTON,"I know as much as that of you, for certain;"
2234,HAMILTON,"And I'm already praying, for your sake,"
2235,HAMILTON,That you be not too strange.  Too much of that
2236,HAMILTON,May lead you bye and bye through gloomy lanes
2237,HAMILTON,"To a sad wilderness, where one may grope"
2238,HAMILTON,"Alone, and always, or until he feels"
2239,HAMILTON,Ferocious and invisible animals
2240,HAMILTON,That wait for men and eat them in the dark.
2241,HAMILTON,"Why do you sit there on the floor so long,"
2242,HAMILTON,Smiling at me while I try to be solemn?
2243,HAMILTON,"Do you not hear it said for your salvation,"
2244,HAMILTON,"When I say truth?  Are you, at four and twenty,"
2245,HAMILTON,So little deceived in us that you interpret
2246,HAMILTON,The humor of a woman to be noticed
2247,HAMILTON,As her choice between you and Acheron?
2248,HAMILTON,Are you so unscathed yet as to infer
2249,HAMILTON,"That if a woman worries when a man,"
2250,HAMILTON,"Or a man-child, has wet shoes on his feet"
2251,HAMILTON,She may as well commemorate with ashes
2252,HAMILTON,The last eclipse of her tranquillity?
2253,HAMILTON,"If you look up at me and blink again,"
2254,HAMILTON,I shall not have to make you tell me lies
2255,HAMILTON,To know the letters you have not been reading.
2256,HAMILTON,I see now that I may have had for nothing
2257,HAMILTON,A most unpleasant shivering in my conscience
2258,HAMILTON,When I laid open for your contemplation
2259,HAMILTON,"The wealth of my worn casket.  If I did,"
2260,HAMILTON,The fault was not yours wholly.  Search again
2261,HAMILTON,"This wreckage we may call for sport a face,"
2262,HAMILTON,And you may chance upon the price of havoc
2263,HAMILTON,That I have paid for a few sorry stones
2264,HAMILTON,"That shine and have no light -- yet once were stars,"
2265,HAMILTON,And sparkled on a crown.  Little and weak
2266,HAMILTON,"They seem; and they are cold, I fear, for you."
2267,HAMILTON,But they that once were fire for me may not
2268,HAMILTON,Be cold again for me until I die;
2269,HAMILTON,And only God knows if they may be then.
2270,HAMILTON,There is a love that ceases to be love
2271,HAMILTON,"In being ourselves.  How, then, are we to lose it?"
2272,HAMILTON,You that are sure that you know everything
2273,HAMILTON,"There is to know of love, answer me that."
2274,HAMILTON,Well? . . .  You are not even interested.
2275,HAMILTON,
2276,HAMILTON,"Once on a far off time when I was young,"
2277,HAMILTON,"I felt with your assurance, and all through me,"
2278,HAMILTON,That I had undergone the last and worst
2279,HAMILTON,Of love's inventions.  There was a boy who brought
2280,HAMILTON,"The sun with him and woke me up with it,"
2281,HAMILTON,And that was every morning; every night
2282,HAMILTON,"I tried to dream of him, but never could,"
2283,HAMILTON,More than I might have seen in Adam's eyes
2284,HAMILTON,Their fond uncertainty when Eve began
2285,HAMILTON,The play that all her tireless progeny
2286,HAMILTON,Are not yet weary of.  One scene of it
2287,HAMILTON,"Was brief, but was eternal while it lasted;"
2288,HAMILTON,And that was while I was the happiest
2289,HAMILTON,"Of an imaginary six or seven,"
2290,HAMILTON,"Somewhere in history but not on earth,"
2291,HAMILTON,For whom the sky had shaken and let stars
2292,HAMILTON,"Rain down like diamonds.  Then there were clouds,"
2293,HAMILTON,And a sad end of diamonds; whereupon
2294,HAMILTON,"Despair came, like a blast that would have brought"
2295,HAMILTON,"Tears to the eyes of all the bears in Finland,"
2296,HAMILTON,And love was done.  That was how much I knew.
2297,HAMILTON,Poor little wretch!  I wonder where he is
2298,HAMILTON,"This afternoon.  Out of this rain, I hope."
2299,HAMILTON,
2300,HAMILTON,"At last, when I had seen so many days"
2301,HAMILTON,"Dressed all alike, and in their marching order,"
2302,HAMILTON,"Go by me that I would not always count them,"
2303,HAMILTON,"One stopped -- shattering the whole file of Time,"
2304,HAMILTON,"Or so it seemed; and when I looked again,"
2305,HAMILTON,"There was a man.  He struck once with his eyes,"
2306,HAMILTON,"And then there was a woman.  I, who had come"
2307,HAMILTON,"To wisdom, or to vision, or what you like,"
2308,HAMILTON,"By the old hidden road that has no name, --"
2309,HAMILTON,"I, who was used to seeing without flying"
2310,HAMILTON,"So much that others fly from without seeing,"
2311,HAMILTON,"Still looked, and was afraid, and looked again."
2312,HAMILTON,"And after that, when I had read the story"
2313,HAMILTON,"Told in his eyes, and felt within my heart"
2314,HAMILTON,"The bleeding wound of their necessity,"
2315,HAMILTON,I knew the fear was his.  If I had failed him
2316,HAMILTON,"And flown away from him, I should have lost"
2317,HAMILTON,"Ingloriously my wings in scrambling back,"
2318,HAMILTON,And found them arms again.  If he had struck me
2319,HAMILTON,"Not only with his eyes but with his hands,"
2320,HAMILTON,"I might have pitied him and hated love,"
2321,HAMILTON,"And then gone mad.  I, who have been so strong --"
2322,HAMILTON,Why don't you laugh? -- might even have done all that.
2323,HAMILTON,"I, who have learned so much, and said so much,"
2324,HAMILTON,And had the commendations of the great
2325,HAMILTON,For one who rules herself -- why don't you cry? --
2326,HAMILTON,And own a certain small authority
2327,HAMILTON,"Among the blind, who see no more than ever,"
2328,HAMILTON,"But like my voice, -- I would have tossed it all"
2329,HAMILTON,To Tophet for one man; and he was jealous.
2330,HAMILTON,I would have wound a snake around my neck
2331,HAMILTON,"And then have let it bite me till I died,"
2332,HAMILTON,If my so doing would have made me sure
2333,HAMILTON,That one man might have lived; and he was jealous.
2334,HAMILTON,I would have driven these hands into a cage
2335,HAMILTON,"That held a thousand scorpions, and crushed them,"
2336,HAMILTON,If only by so poisonous a trial
2337,HAMILTON,I could have crushed his doubt.  I would have wrung
2338,HAMILTON,My living blood with mediaeval engines
2339,HAMILTON,"Out of my screaming flesh, if only that"
2340,HAMILTON,Would have made one man sure.  I would have paid
2341,HAMILTON,"For him the tiresome price of body and soul,"
2342,HAMILTON,And let the lash of a tongue-weary town
2343,HAMILTON,Fall as it might upon my blistered name;
2344,HAMILTON,"And while it fell I could have laughed at it,"
2345,HAMILTON,Knowing that he had found out finally
2346,HAMILTON,Where the wrong was.  But there was evil in him
2347,HAMILTON,That would have made no more of his possession
2348,HAMILTON,Than confirmation of another fault;
2349,HAMILTON,And there was honor -- if you call it honor
2350,HAMILTON,That hoods itself with doubt and wears a crown
2351,HAMILTON,Of lead that might as well be gold and fire.
2352,HAMILTON,Give it as heavy or as light a name
2353,HAMILTON,As any there is that fits.  I see myself
2354,HAMILTON,Without the power to swear to this or that
2355,HAMILTON,That I might be if he had been without it.
2356,HAMILTON,"Whatever I might have been that I was not,"
2357,HAMILTON,It only happened that it wasn't so.
2358,HAMILTON,"Meanwhile, you might seem to be listening:"
2359,HAMILTON,"If you forget yourself and go to sleep,"
2360,HAMILTON,"My treasure, I shall not say this again."
2361,HAMILTON,"Look up once more into my poor old face,"
2362,HAMILTON,"Where you see beauty, or the Lord knows what,"
2363,HAMILTON,And say to me aloud what else there is
2364,HAMILTON,Than ruins in it that you most admire.
2365,HAMILTON,
2366,HAMILTON,"No, there was never anything like that;"
2367,HAMILTON,Nature has never fastened such a mask
2368,HAMILTON,Of radiant and impenetrable merit
2369,HAMILTON,On any woman as you say there is
2370,HAMILTON,"On this one.  Not a mask?  I thank you, sir,"
2371,HAMILTON,"But you see more with your determination,"
2372,HAMILTON,"I fear, than with your prudence or your conscience;"
2373,HAMILTON,And you have never met me with my eyes
2374,HAMILTON,In all the mirrors I've made faces at.
2375,HAMILTON,"No, I shall never call you strange again:"
2376,HAMILTON,You are the young and inconvincible
2377,HAMILTON,Epitome of all blind men since Adam.
2378,HAMILTON,"May the blind lead the blind, if that be so?"
2379,HAMILTON,And we shall need no mirrors?  You are saying
2380,HAMILTON,"What most I feared you might.  But if the blind,"
2381,HAMILTON,"Or one of them, be not so fortunate"
2382,HAMILTON,"As to put out the eyes of recollection,"
2383,HAMILTON,"She might at last, without her meaning it,"
2384,HAMILTON,"Lead on the other, without his knowing it,"
2385,HAMILTON,Until the two of them should lose themselves
2386,HAMILTON,Among dead craters in a lava-field
2387,HAMILTON,As empty as a desert on the moon.
2388,HAMILTON,"I am not speaking in a theatre,"
2389,HAMILTON,But in a room so real and so familiar
2390,HAMILTON,"That sometimes I would wreck it.  Then I pause,"
2391,HAMILTON,Remembering there is a King in Weimar --
2392,HAMILTON,"A monarch, and a poet, and a shepherd"
2393,HAMILTON,Of all who are astray and are outside
2394,HAMILTON,"The realm where they should rule.  I think of him,"
2395,HAMILTON,"And save the furniture; I think of you,"
2396,HAMILTON,"And am forlorn, finding in you the one"
2397,HAMILTON,To lavish aspirations and illusions
2398,HAMILTON,Upon a faded and forsaken house
2399,HAMILTON,"Where love, being locked alone, was nigh to burning"
2400,HAMILTON,"House and himself together.  Yes, you are strange,"
2401,HAMILTON,To see in such an injured architecture
2402,HAMILTON,Room for new love to live in.  Are you laughing?
2403,HAMILTON,"No?  Well, you are not crying, as you should be."
2404,HAMILTON,"Tears, even if they told only gratitude"
2405,HAMILTON,"For your escape, and had no other story,"
2406,HAMILTON,Were surely more becoming than a smile
2407,HAMILTON,For my unwomanly straightforwardness
2408,HAMILTON,"In seeing for you, through my close gate of years"
2409,HAMILTON,Your forty ways to freedom.  Why do you smile?
2410,HAMILTON,And while I'm trembling at my faith in you
2411,HAMILTON,In giving you to read this book of danger
2412,HAMILTON,That only one man living might have written --
2413,HAMILTON,"These letters, which have been a part of me"
2414,HAMILTON,So long that you may read them all again
2415,HAMILTON,"As often as you look into my face,"
2416,HAMILTON,"And hear them when I speak to you, and feel them"
2417,HAMILTON,"Whenever you have to touch me with your hand, --"
2418,HAMILTON,Why are you so unwilling to be spared?
2419,HAMILTON,"Why do you still believe in me?  But no,"
2420,HAMILTON,I'll find another way to ask you that.
2421,HAMILTON,I wonder if there is another way
2422,HAMILTON,"That says it better, and means anything."
2423,HAMILTON,There is no other way that could be worse?
2424,HAMILTON,I was not asking you; it was myself
2425,HAMILTON,Alone that I was asking.  Why do I dip
2426,HAMILTON,"For lies, when there is nothing in my well"
2427,HAMILTON,"But shining truth, you say?  How do you know?"
2428,HAMILTON,Truth has a lonely life down where she lives;
2429,HAMILTON,"And many a time, when she comes up to breathe,"
2430,HAMILTON,"She sinks before we seize her, and makes ripples."
2431,HAMILTON,Possibly you may know no more of me
2432,HAMILTON,"Than a few ripples; and they may soon be gone,"
2433,HAMILTON,Leaving you then with all my shining truth
2434,HAMILTON,Drowned in a shining water; and when you look
2435,HAMILTON,"You may not see me there, but something else"
2436,HAMILTON,That never was a woman -- being yourself.
2437,HAMILTON,"You say to me my truth is past all drowning,"
2438,HAMILTON,And safe with you for ever?  You know all that?
2439,HAMILTON,"How do you know all that, and who has told you?"
2440,HAMILTON,You know so much that I'm an atom frightened
2441,HAMILTON,Because you know so little.  And what is this?
2442,HAMILTON,You know the luxury there is in haunting
2443,HAMILTON,The blasted thoroughfares of disillusion --
2444,HAMILTON,If that's your name for them -- with only ghosts
2445,HAMILTON,For company?  You know that when a woman
2446,HAMILTON,"Is blessed, or cursed, with a divine impatience"
2447,HAMILTON,(Another name of yours for a bad temper)
2448,HAMILTON,She must have one at hand on whom to wreak it
2449,HAMILTON,"(That's what you mean, whatever the turn you give it),"
2450,HAMILTON,"Sure of a kindred sympathy, and thereby"
2451,HAMILTON,"Effect a mutual calm?  You know that wisdom,"
2452,HAMILTON,Given in vain to make a food for those
2453,HAMILTON,"Who are without it, will be seen at last,"
2454,HAMILTON,"And even at last only by those who gave it,"
2455,HAMILTON,As one or more of the forgotten crumbs
2456,HAMILTON,That others leave?  You know that men's applause
2457,HAMILTON,And women's envy savor so much of dust
2458,HAMILTON,"That I go hungry, having at home no fare"
2459,HAMILTON,But the same changeless bread that I may swallow
2460,HAMILTON,Only with tears and prayers?  Who told you that?
2461,HAMILTON,"You know that if I read, and read alone,"
2462,HAMILTON,"Too many books that no men yet have written,"
2463,HAMILTON,"I may go blind, or worse?  You know yourself,"
2464,HAMILTON,"Of all insistent and insidious creatures,"
2465,HAMILTON,"To be the one to save me, and to guard"
2466,HAMILTON,For me their flaming language?  And you know
2467,HAMILTON,That if I give much headway to the whim
2468,HAMILTON,That's in me never to be quite sure that even
2469,HAMILTON,Through all those years of storm and fire I waited
2470,HAMILTON,"For this one rainy day, I may go on,"
2471,HAMILTON,"And on, and on alone, through smoke and ashes,"
2472,HAMILTON,To a cold end?  You know so dismal much
2473,HAMILTON,"As that about me? . . .  Well, I believe you do."
2474,HAMILTON,
2475,HAMILTON,
2476,HAMILTON,
2477,HAMILTON,
2478,HAMILTON,Nimmo
2479,HAMILTON,
2480,HAMILTON,"Since you remember Nimmo, and arrive"
2481,HAMILTON,At such a false and florid and far drawn
2482,HAMILTON,"Confusion of odd nonsense, I connive"
2483,HAMILTON,"No longer, though I may have led you on."
2484,HAMILTON,
2485,HAMILTON,"So much is told and heard and told again,"
2486,HAMILTON,"So many with his legend are engrossed,"
2487,HAMILTON,"That I, more sorry now than I was then,"
2488,HAMILTON,May live on to be sorry for his ghost.
2489,HAMILTON,
2490,HAMILTON,"You knew him, and you must have known his eyes, --"
2491,HAMILTON,"How deep they were, and what a velvet light"
2492,HAMILTON,"Came out of them when anger or surprise,"
2493,HAMILTON,"Or laughter, or Francesca, made them bright."
2494,HAMILTON,
2495,HAMILTON,"No, you will not forget such eyes, I think, --"
2496,HAMILTON,And you say nothing of them.  Very well.
2497,HAMILTON,"I wonder if all history's worth a wink,"
2498,HAMILTON,"Sometimes, or if my tale be one to tell."
2499,HAMILTON,
2500,HAMILTON,For they began to lose their velvet light;
2501,HAMILTON,Their fire grew dead without and small within;
2502,HAMILTON,And many of you deplored the needless fight
2503,HAMILTON,That somewhere in the dark there must have been.
2504,HAMILTON,
2505,HAMILTON,"All fights are needless, when they're not our own,"
2506,HAMILTON,But Nimmo and Francesca never fought.
2507,HAMILTON,"Remember that; and when you are alone,"
2508,HAMILTON,Remember me -- and think what I have thought.
2509,HAMILTON,
2510,HAMILTON,"Now, mind you, I say nothing of what was,"
2511,HAMILTON,"Or never was, or could or could not be:"
2512,HAMILTON,Bring not suspicion's candle to the glass
2513,HAMILTON,That mirrors a friend's face to memory.
2514,HAMILTON,
2515,HAMILTON,"Of what you see, see all, -- but see no more;"
2516,HAMILTON,For what I show you here will not be there.
2517,HAMILTON,"The devil has had his way with paint before,"
2518,HAMILTON,"And he's an artist, -- and you needn't stare."
2519,HAMILTON,
2520,HAMILTON,There was a painter and he painted well:
2521,HAMILTON,"He'd paint you Daniel in the lions' den,"
2522,HAMILTON,"Beelzebub, Elaine, or William Tell."
2523,HAMILTON,I'm coming back to Nimmo's eyes again.
2524,HAMILTON,
2525,HAMILTON,"The painter put the devil in those eyes,"
2526,HAMILTON,"Unless the devil did, and there he stayed;"
2527,HAMILTON,"And then the lady fled from paradise,"
2528,HAMILTON,And there's your fact.  The lady was afraid.
2529,HAMILTON,
2530,HAMILTON,"She must have been afraid, or may have been,"
2531,HAMILTON,Of evil in their velvet all the while;
2532,HAMILTON,"But sure as I'm a sinner with a skin,"
2533,HAMILTON,I'll trust the man as long as he can smile.
2534,HAMILTON,
2535,HAMILTON,I trust him who can smile and then may live
2536,HAMILTON,"In my heart's house, where Nimmo is today."
2537,HAMILTON,God knows if I have more than men forgive
2538,HAMILTON,"To tell him; but I played, and I shall pay."
2539,HAMILTON,
2540,HAMILTON,"I knew him then, and if I know him yet,"
2541,HAMILTON,"I know in him, defeated and estranged,"
2542,HAMILTON,The calm of men forbidden to forget
2543,HAMILTON,The calm of women who have loved and changed.
2544,HAMILTON,
2545,HAMILTON,"But there are ways that are beyond our ways,"
2546,HAMILTON,"Or he would not be calm and she be mute,"
2547,HAMILTON,As one by one their lost and empty days
2548,HAMILTON,Pass without even the warmth of a dispute.
2549,HAMILTON,
2550,HAMILTON,God help us all when women think they see;
2551,HAMILTON,God save us when they do.  I'm fair; but though
2552,HAMILTON,"I know him only as he looks to me,"
2553,HAMILTON,"I know him, -- and I tell Francesca so."
2554,HAMILTON,
2555,HAMILTON,And what of Nimmo?  Little would you ask
2556,HAMILTON,"Of him, could you but see him as I can,"
2557,HAMILTON,At his bewildered and unfruitful task
2558,HAMILTON,Of being what he was born to be -- a man.
2559,HAMILTON,
2560,HAMILTON,Better forget that I said anything
2561,HAMILTON,Of what your tortured memory may disclose;
2562,HAMILTON,"I know him, and your worst remembering"
2563,HAMILTON,"Would count as much as nothing, I suppose."
2564,HAMILTON,
2565,HAMILTON,"Meanwhile, I trust him; and I know his way"
2566,HAMILTON,"Of trusting me, as always in his youth."
2567,HAMILTON,"I'm painting here a better man, you say,"
2568,HAMILTON,"Than I, the painter; and you say the truth."
2569,HAMILTON,
2570,HAMILTON,
2571,HAMILTON,
2572,HAMILTON,
2573,HAMILTON,Peace on Earth
2574,HAMILTON,
2575,HAMILTON,"He took a frayed hat from his head,"
2576,HAMILTON,"And ""Peace on Earth"" was what he said."
2577,HAMILTON,"""A morsel out of what you're worth,"
2578,HAMILTON,And there we have it:  Peace on Earth.
2579,HAMILTON,"Not much, although a little more"
2580,HAMILTON,Than what there was on earth before.
2581,HAMILTON,"I'm as you see, I'm Ichabod, --"
2582,HAMILTON,But never mind the ways I've trod;
2583,HAMILTON,"I'm sober now, so help me God."""
2584,HAMILTON,
2585,HAMILTON,I could not pass the fellow by.
2586,HAMILTON,"""Do you believe in God?"" said I;"
2587,HAMILTON,"""And is there to be Peace on Earth?"""
2588,HAMILTON,
2589,HAMILTON,"""Tonight we celebrate the birth,"""
2590,HAMILTON,"He said, ""of One who died for men;"
2591,HAMILTON,"The Son of God, we say.  What then?"
2592,HAMILTON,"Your God, or mine?  I'd make you laugh"
2593,HAMILTON,Were I to tell you even half
2594,HAMILTON,That I have learned of mine today
2595,HAMILTON,Where yours would hardly seem to stay.
2596,HAMILTON,Could He but follow in and out
2597,HAMILTON,"Some anthropoids I know about,"
2598,HAMILTON,The God to whom you may have prayed
2599,HAMILTON,"Might see a world He never made."""
2600,HAMILTON,
2601,HAMILTON,"""Your words are flowing full,"" said I;"
2602,HAMILTON,"""But yet they give me no reply;"
2603,HAMILTON,"Your fountain might as well be dry."""
2604,HAMILTON,
2605,HAMILTON,"""A wiser One than you, my friend,"
2606,HAMILTON,Would wait and hear me to the end;
2607,HAMILTON,And for His eyes a light would shine
2608,HAMILTON,Through this unpleasant shell of mine
2609,HAMILTON,That in your fancy makes of me
2610,HAMILTON,A Christmas curiosity.
2611,HAMILTON,"All right, I might be worse than that;"
2612,HAMILTON,And you might now be lying flat;
2613,HAMILTON,"I might have done it from behind,"
2614,HAMILTON,And taken what there was to find.
2615,HAMILTON,"Don't worry, for I'm not that kind."
2616,HAMILTON,`Do I believe in God?'  Is that
2617,HAMILTON,The price tonight of a new hat?
2618,HAMILTON,Has He commanded that His name
2619,HAMILTON,Be written everywhere the same?
2620,HAMILTON,Have all who live in every place
2621,HAMILTON,Identified His hidden face?
2622,HAMILTON,Who knows but He may like as well
2623,HAMILTON,My story as one you may tell?
2624,HAMILTON,And if He show me there be Peace
2625,HAMILTON,"On Earth, as there be fields and trees"
2626,HAMILTON,"Outside a jail-yard, am I wrong"
2627,HAMILTON,If now I sing Him a new song?
2628,HAMILTON,"Your world is in yourself, my friend,"
2629,HAMILTON,For your endurance to the end;
2630,HAMILTON,And all the Peace there is on Earth
2631,HAMILTON,"Is faith in what your world is worth,"
2632,HAMILTON,"And saying, without any lies,"
2633,HAMILTON,"Your world could not be otherwise."""
2634,HAMILTON,
2635,HAMILTON,"""One might say that and then be shot,"""
2636,HAMILTON,"I told him; and he said:  ""Why not?"""
2637,HAMILTON,"I ceased, and gave him rather more"
2638,HAMILTON,Than he was counting of my store.
2639,HAMILTON,"""And since I have it, thanks to you,"
2640,HAMILTON,"Don't ask me what I mean to do,"""
2641,HAMILTON,"Said he.  ""Believe that even I"
2642,HAMILTON,Would rather tell the truth than lie --
2643,HAMILTON,"On Christmas Eve.  No matter why."""
2644,HAMILTON,
2645,HAMILTON,"His unshaved, educated face,"
2646,HAMILTON,"His inextinguishable grace,"
2647,HAMILTON,"And his hard smile, are with me still,"
2648,HAMILTON,Deplore the vision as I will;
2649,HAMILTON,"For whatsoever he be at,"
2650,HAMILTON,So droll a derelict as that
2651,HAMILTON,Should have at least another hat.
2652,HAMILTON,
2653,HAMILTON,
2654,HAMILTON,
2655,HAMILTON,
2656,HAMILTON,Late Summer
2657,HAMILTON,
2658,HAMILTON,(Alcaics)
2659,HAMILTON,
2660,HAMILTON,"Confused, he found her lavishing feminine"
2661,HAMILTON,"Gold upon clay, and found her inscrutable;"
2662,HAMILTON,"And yet she smiled.  Why, then, should horrors"
2663,HAMILTON,"Be as they were, without end, her playthings?"
2664,HAMILTON,
2665,HAMILTON,And why were dead years hungrily telling her
2666,HAMILTON,"Lies of the dead, who told them again to her?"
2667,HAMILTON,"If now she knew, there might be kindness"
2668,HAMILTON,Clamoring yet where a faith lay stifled.
2669,HAMILTON,
2670,HAMILTON,"A little faith in him, and the ruinous"
2671,HAMILTON,"Past would be for time to annihilate,"
2672,HAMILTON,"And wash out, like a tide that washes"
2673,HAMILTON,Out of the sand what a child has drawn there.
2674,HAMILTON,
2675,HAMILTON,"God, what a shining handful of happiness,"
2676,HAMILTON,"Made out of days and out of eternities,"
2677,HAMILTON,Were now the pulsing end of patience --
2678,HAMILTON,Could he but have what a ghost had stolen!
2679,HAMILTON,
2680,HAMILTON,"What was a man before him, or ten of them,"
2681,HAMILTON,"While he was here alive who could answer them,"
2682,HAMILTON,And in their teeth fling confirmations
2683,HAMILTON,Harder than agates against an egg-shell?
2684,HAMILTON,
2685,HAMILTON,"But now the man was dead, and would come again"
2686,HAMILTON,"Never, though she might honor ineffably"
2687,HAMILTON,The flimsy wraith of him she conjured
2688,HAMILTON,Out of a dream with his wand of absence.
2689,HAMILTON,
2690,HAMILTON,"And if the truth were now but a mummery,"
2691,HAMILTON,"Meriting pride's implacable irony,"
2692,HAMILTON,"So much the worse for pride.  Moreover,"
2693,HAMILTON,"Save her or fail, there was conscience always."
2694,HAMILTON,
2695,HAMILTON,"Meanwhile, a few misgivings of innocence,"
2696,HAMILTON,"Imploring to be sheltered and credited,"
2697,HAMILTON,Were not amiss when she revealed them.
2698,HAMILTON,"Whether she struggled or not, he saw them."
2699,HAMILTON,
2700,HAMILTON,"Also, he saw that while she was hearing him"
2701,HAMILTON,Her eyes had more and more of the past in them;
2702,HAMILTON,And while he told what cautious honor
2703,HAMILTON,"Told him was all he had best be sure of,"
2704,HAMILTON,
2705,HAMILTON,"He wondered once or twice, inadvertently,"
2706,HAMILTON,"Where shifting winds were driving his argosies,"
2707,HAMILTON,"Long anchored and as long unladen,"
2708,HAMILTON,Over the foam for the golden chances.
2709,HAMILTON,
2710,HAMILTON,"""If men were not for killing so carelessly,"
2711,HAMILTON,"And women were for wiser endurances,"""
2712,HAMILTON,"He said, ""we might have yet a world here"
2713,HAMILTON,Fitter for Truth to be seen abroad in;
2714,HAMILTON,
2715,HAMILTON,"""If Truth were not so strange in her nakedness,"
2716,HAMILTON,"And we were less forbidden to look at it,"
2717,HAMILTON,"We might not have to look.""  He stared then"
2718,HAMILTON,Down at the sand where the tide threw forward
2719,HAMILTON,
2720,HAMILTON,"Its cold, unconquered lines, that unceasingly"
2721,HAMILTON,"Foamed against hope, and fell.  He was calm enough,"
2722,HAMILTON,Although he knew he might be silenced
2723,HAMILTON,Out of all calm; and the night was coming.
2724,HAMILTON,
2725,HAMILTON,"""I climb for you the peak of his infamy"
2726,HAMILTON,That you may choose your fall if you cling to it.
2727,HAMILTON,No more for me unless you say more.
2728,HAMILTON,All you have left of a dream defends you:
2729,HAMILTON,
2730,HAMILTON,"""The truth may be as evil an augury"
2731,HAMILTON,As it was needful now for the two of us.
2732,HAMILTON,We cannot have the dead between us.
2733,HAMILTON,"Tell me to go, and I go.""  -- She pondered:"
2734,HAMILTON,
2735,HAMILTON,"""What you believe is right for the two of us"
2736,HAMILTON,Makes it as right that you are not one of us.
2737,HAMILTON,"If this be needful truth you tell me,"
2738,HAMILTON,"Spare me, and let me have lies hereafter."""
2739,HAMILTON,
2740,HAMILTON,She gazed away where shadows were covering
2741,HAMILTON,The whole cold ocean's healing indifference.
2742,HAMILTON,No ship was coming.  When the darkness
2743,HAMILTON,"Fell, she was there, and alone, still gazing."

2752,HAMILTON,I do you wrong?  I do not hear your praise
2753,HAMILTON,To God for giving you me to share your task?
2754,HAMILTON,
2755,HAMILTON,"""Jealous -- of Her?  Because her cheeks are pink,"
2756,HAMILTON,"And she has eyes?  No, not if she had seven."
2757,HAMILTON,"If you should only steal an hour to think,"
2758,HAMILTON,"Sometime, there might be less to be forgiven."
2759,HAMILTON,
2760,HAMILTON,"""No, you are never cruel.  If once or twice"
2761,HAMILTON,"I found you so, I could applaud and sing."
2762,HAMILTON,Jealous of -- What?  You are not very wise.
2763,HAMILTON,Does not the good Book tell you anything?
2764,HAMILTON,
2765,HAMILTON,"""In David's time poor Michal had to go."
2766,HAMILTON,"Jealous of God?  Well, if you like it so."""

2775,HAMILTON,And only with a furtive recognition
2776,HAMILTON,"See dust where there is dust, --"
2777,HAMILTON,"Be sure you like it always in your faces,"
2778,HAMILTON,"Obscuring your best graces,"
2779,HAMILTON,"Blinding your speech and sight,"
2780,HAMILTON,Before you seek again your dusty places
2781,HAMILTON,Where the old wrong seems right.
2782,HAMILTON,
2783,HAMILTON,Longer ago than cave-men had their changes
2784,HAMILTON,"Our fathers may have slain a son or two,"
2785,HAMILTON,Discouraging a further dialectic
2786,HAMILTON,Regarding what was new;
2787,HAMILTON,And after their unstudied admonition
2788,HAMILTON,Occasional contrition
2789,HAMILTON,For their old-fashioned ways
2790,HAMILTON,"May have reduced their doubts, and in addition"
2791,HAMILTON,Softened their final days.
2792,HAMILTON,
2793,HAMILTON,Farther away than feet shall ever travel
2794,HAMILTON,Are the vague towers of our unbuilded State;
2795,HAMILTON,"But there are mightier things than we to lead us,"
2796,HAMILTON,That will not let us wait.
2797,HAMILTON,And we go on with none to tell us whether
2798,HAMILTON,Or not we've each a tether
2799,HAMILTON,Determining how fast or far we go;
2800,HAMILTON,"And it is well, since we must go together,"
2801,HAMILTON,That we are not to know.
2802,HAMILTON,
2803,HAMILTON,If the old wrong and all its injured glamour
2804,HAMILTON,"Haunts you by day and gives your night no peace,"
2805,HAMILTON,"You may as well, agreeably and serenely,"
2806,HAMILTON,Give the new wrong its lease;
2807,HAMILTON,For should you nourish a too fervid yearning
2808,HAMILTON,"For what is not returning,"
2809,HAMILTON,The vicious and unfused ingredient
2810,HAMILTON,May give you qualms -- and one or two concerning

2822,HAMILTON,"I might as well have been the sound of rain,"
2823,HAMILTON,"A wind among the cedars, or a bird;"
2824,HAMILTON,"Or nothing.  Mary, make him look at you;"
2825,HAMILTON,"And even if he should say that we are nothing,"
2826,HAMILTON,To know that you have heard him will be something.
2827,HAMILTON,"And yet he loved us, and it was for love"
2828,HAMILTON,The Master gave him back.  Why did He wait
2829,HAMILTON,So long before He came?  Why did He weep?
2830,HAMILTON,I thought He would be glad -- and Lazarus --
2831,HAMILTON,To see us all again as He had left us --
2832,HAMILTON,"All as it was, all as it was before."""
2833,HAMILTON,
2834,HAMILTON,"Mary, who felt her sister's frightened arms"
2835,HAMILTON,"Like those of someone drowning who had seized her,"
2836,HAMILTON,Fearing at last they were to fail and sink
2837,HAMILTON,"Together in this fog-stricken sea of strangeness,"
2838,HAMILTON,"Fought sadly, with bereaved indignant eyes,"
2839,HAMILTON,To find again the fading shores of home
2840,HAMILTON,That she had seen but now could see no longer.
2841,HAMILTON,"Now she could only gaze into the twilight,"
2842,HAMILTON,"And in the dimness know that he was there,"
2843,HAMILTON,Like someone that was not.  He who had been
2844,HAMILTON,"Their brother, and was dead, now seemed alive"
2845,HAMILTON,Only in death again -- or worse than death;
2846,HAMILTON,"For tombs at least, always until today,"
2847,HAMILTON,Though sad were certain.  There was nothing certain
2848,HAMILTON,For man or God in such a day as this;
2849,HAMILTON,"For there they were alone, and there was he --"
2850,HAMILTON,"Alone; and somewhere out of Bethany,"
2851,HAMILTON,"The Master -- who had come to them so late,"
2852,HAMILTON,"Only for love of them and then so slowly,"
2853,HAMILTON,And was for their sake hunted now by men
2854,HAMILTON,Who feared Him as they feared no other prey --
2855,HAMILTON,"For the world's sake was hidden.  ""Better the tomb"
2856,HAMILTON,"For Lazarus than life, if this be life,"""
2857,HAMILTON,"She thought; and then to Martha, ""No, my dear,"""
2858,HAMILTON,"She said aloud; ""not as it was before."
2859,HAMILTON,"Nothing is ever as it was before,"
2860,HAMILTON,Where Time has been.  Here there is more than Time;
2861,HAMILTON,And we that are so lonely and so far
2862,HAMILTON,"From home, since he is with us here again,"
2863,HAMILTON,Are farther now from him and from ourselves
2864,HAMILTON,Than we are from the stars.  He will not speak
2865,HAMILTON,Until the spirit that is in him speaks;
2866,HAMILTON,"And we must wait for all we are to know,"
2867,HAMILTON,Or even to learn that we are not to know.
2868,HAMILTON,"Martha, we are too near to this for knowledge,"
2869,HAMILTON,And that is why it is that we must wait.
2870,HAMILTON,"Our friends are coming if we call for them,"
2871,HAMILTON,And there are covers we'll put over him
2872,HAMILTON,"To make him warmer.  We are too young, perhaps,"
2873,HAMILTON,To say that we know better what is best
2874,HAMILTON,Than he.  We do not know how old he is.
2875,HAMILTON,"If you remember what the Master said,"
2876,HAMILTON,Try to believe that we need have no fear.
2877,HAMILTON,"Let me, the selfish and the careless one,"
2878,HAMILTON,Be housewife and a mother for tonight;
2879,HAMILTON,"For I am not so fearful as you are,"
2880,HAMILTON,"And I was not so eager."""
2881,HAMILTON,
2882,HAMILTON,Martha sank
2883,HAMILTON,Down at her sister's feet and there sat watching
2884,HAMILTON,A flower that had a small familiar name
2885,HAMILTON,"That was as old as memory, but was not"
2886,HAMILTON,The name of what she saw now in its brief
2887,HAMILTON,And infinite mystery that so frightened her
2888,HAMILTON,That life became a terror.  Tears again
2889,HAMILTON,"Flooded her eyes and overflowed.  ""No, Mary,"""
2890,HAMILTON,"She murmured slowly, hating her own words"
2891,HAMILTON,"Before she heard them, ""you are not so eager"
2892,HAMILTON,To see our brother as we see him now;
2893,HAMILTON,Neither is He who gave him back to us.
2894,HAMILTON,"I was to be the simple one, as always,"
2895,HAMILTON,"And this was all for me.""  She stared again"
2896,HAMILTON,"Over among the trees where Lazarus,"
2897,HAMILTON,"Who seemed to be a man who was not there,"
2898,HAMILTON,"Might have been one more shadow among shadows,"
2899,HAMILTON,If she had not remembered.  Then she felt
2900,HAMILTON,"The cool calm hands of Mary on her face,"
2901,HAMILTON,"And shivered, wondering if such hands were real."
2902,HAMILTON,
2903,HAMILTON,"""The Master loved you as He loved us all,"
2904,HAMILTON,Martha; and you are saying only things
2905,HAMILTON,That children say when they have had no sleep.
2906,HAMILTON,Try somehow now to rest a little while;
2907,HAMILTON,"You know that I am here, and that our friends"
2908,HAMILTON,"Are coming if I call."""
2909,HAMILTON,
2910,HAMILTON,Martha at last
2911,HAMILTON,"Arose, and went with Mary to the door,"
2912,HAMILTON,"Where they stood looking off at the same place,"
2913,HAMILTON,And at the same shape that was always there
2914,HAMILTON,"As if it would not ever move or speak,"
2915,HAMILTON,"And always would be there.  ""Mary, go now,"
2916,HAMILTON,Before the dark that will be coming hides him.
2917,HAMILTON,"I am afraid of him out there alone,"
2918,HAMILTON,Unless I see him; and I have forgotten
2919,HAMILTON,What sleep is.  Go now -- make him look at you --
2920,HAMILTON,And I shall hear him if he stirs or whispers.
2921,HAMILTON,Go! -- or I'll scream and bring all Bethany
2922,HAMILTON,To come and make him speak.  Make him say once
2923,HAMILTON,"That he is glad, and God may say the rest."
2924,HAMILTON,"Though He say I shall sleep, and sleep for ever,"
2925,HAMILTON,"I shall not care for that . . . Go!"""
2926,HAMILTON,
2927,HAMILTON,"Mary, moving"
2928,HAMILTON,"Almost as if an angry child had pushed her,"
2929,HAMILTON,Went forward a few steps; and having waited
2930,HAMILTON,"As long as Martha's eyes would look at hers,"
2931,HAMILTON,"Went forward a few more, and a few more;"
2932,HAMILTON,"And so, until she came to Lazarus,"
2933,HAMILTON,"Who crouched with his face hidden in his hands,"
2934,HAMILTON,"Like one that had no face.  Before she spoke,"
2935,HAMILTON,Feeling her sister's eyes that were behind her
2936,HAMILTON,As if the door where Martha stood were now
2937,HAMILTON,"As far from her as Egypt, Mary turned"
2938,HAMILTON,"Once more to see that she was there.  Then, softly,"
2939,HAMILTON,Fearing him not so much as wondering
2940,HAMILTON,"What his first word might be, said, ""Lazarus,"
2941,HAMILTON,"Forgive us if we seemed afraid of you;"""
2942,HAMILTON,"And having spoken, pitied her poor speech"
2943,HAMILTON,"That had so little seeming gladness in it,"
2944,HAMILTON,"So little comfort, and so little love."
2945,HAMILTON,
2946,HAMILTON,"There was no sign from him that he had heard,"
2947,HAMILTON,"Or that he knew that she was there, or cared"
2948,HAMILTON,Whether she spoke to him again or died
2949,HAMILTON,"There at his feet.  ""We love you, Lazarus,"
2950,HAMILTON,And we are not afraid.  The Master said
2951,HAMILTON,We need not be afraid.  Will you not say
2952,HAMILTON,"To me that you are glad?  Look, Lazarus!"
2953,HAMILTON,"Look at my face, and see me.  This is Mary."""
2954,HAMILTON,
2955,HAMILTON,"She found his hands and held them.  They were cool,"
2956,HAMILTON,"Like hers, but they were not so calm as hers."
2957,HAMILTON,Through the white robes in which his friends had wrapped him
2958,HAMILTON,"When he had groped out of that awful sleep,"
2959,HAMILTON,She felt him trembling and she was afraid.
2960,HAMILTON,At last he sighed; and she prayed hungrily
2961,HAMILTON,To God that she might have again the voice
2962,HAMILTON,"Of Lazarus, whose hands were giving her now"
2963,HAMILTON,The recognition of a living pressure
2964,HAMILTON,"That was almost a language.  When he spoke,"
2965,HAMILTON,Only one word that she had waited for
2966,HAMILTON,"Came from his lips, and that word was her name."
2967,HAMILTON,
2968,HAMILTON,"""I heard them saying, Mary, that He wept"
2969,HAMILTON,"Before I woke.""  The words were low and shaken,"
2970,HAMILTON,Yet Mary knew that he who uttered them
2971,HAMILTON,Was Lazarus; and that would be enough
2972,HAMILTON,"Until there should be more . . . ""Who made Him come,"
2973,HAMILTON,"That He should weep for me? . . .  Was it you, Mary?"""
2974,HAMILTON,The questions held in his incredulous eyes
2975,HAMILTON,Were more than she would see.  She looked away;
2976,HAMILTON,"But she had felt them and should feel for ever,"
2977,HAMILTON,"She thought, their cold and lonely desperation"
2978,HAMILTON,That had the bitterness of all cold things
2979,HAMILTON,"That were not cruel.  ""I should have wept,"" he said,"
2980,HAMILTON,"""If I had been the Master. . . ."""
2981,HAMILTON,
2982,HAMILTON,Now she could feel
2983,HAMILTON,His hands above her hair -- the same black hair
2984,HAMILTON,"That once he made a jest of, praising it,"
2985,HAMILTON,While Martha's busy eyes had left their work
2986,HAMILTON,To flash with laughing envy.  Nothing of that
2987,HAMILTON,Was to be theirs again; and such a thought
2988,HAMILTON,Was like the flying by of a quick bird
2989,HAMILTON,Seen through a shadowy doorway in the twilight.
2990,HAMILTON,"For now she felt his hands upon her head,"
2991,HAMILTON,"Like weights of kindness:  ""I forgive you, Mary. . . ."
2992,HAMILTON,You did not know -- Martha could not have known --
2993,HAMILTON,Only the Master knew. . . .  Where is He now?
2994,HAMILTON,"Yes, I remember.  They came after Him."
2995,HAMILTON,May the good God forgive Him. . . .  I forgive Him.
2996,HAMILTON,I must; and I may know only from Him
2997,HAMILTON,The burden of all this. . . .  Martha was here --
2998,HAMILTON,But I was not yet here.  She was afraid. . . .
2999,HAMILTON,"Why did He do it, Mary?  Was it -- you?"
3000,HAMILTON,Was it for you? . . .  Where are the friends I saw?
3001,HAMILTON,"Yes, I remember.  They all went away."
3002,HAMILTON,I made them go away. . . .  Where is He now? . . .
3003,HAMILTON,What do I see down there?  Do I see Martha --
3004,HAMILTON,"Down by the door? . . .  I must have time for this."""
3005,HAMILTON,
3006,HAMILTON,"Lazarus looked about him fearfully,"
3007,HAMILTON,"And then again at Mary, who discovered"
3008,HAMILTON,"Awakening apprehension in his eyes,"
3009,HAMILTON,And shivered at his feet.  All she had feared
3010,HAMILTON,Was here; and only in the slow reproach
3011,HAMILTON,Of his forgiveness lived his gratitude.
3012,HAMILTON,Why had he asked if it was all for her
3013,HAMILTON,That he was here?  And what had Martha meant?
3014,HAMILTON,Why had the Master waited?  What was coming
3015,HAMILTON,"To Lazarus, and to them, that had not come?"
3016,HAMILTON,"What had the Master seen before He came,"
3017,HAMILTON,That He had come so late?
3018,HAMILTON,
3019,HAMILTON,"""Where is He, Mary?"""
3020,HAMILTON,"Lazarus asked again.  ""Where did He go?"""
3021,HAMILTON,"Once more he gazed about him, and once more"
3022,HAMILTON,"At Mary for an answer.  ""Have they found Him?"
3023,HAMILTON,Or did He go away because He wished
3024,HAMILTON,Never to look into my eyes again? . . .
3025,HAMILTON,"That, I could understand. . . .  Where is He, Mary?"""
3026,HAMILTON,
3027,HAMILTON,"""I do not know,"" she said.  ""Yet in my heart"
3028,HAMILTON,"I know that He is living, as you are living --"
3029,HAMILTON,"Living, and here.  He is not far from us."
3030,HAMILTON,He will come back to us and find us all --
3031,HAMILTON,"Lazarus, Martha, Mary -- everything --"
3032,HAMILTON,All as it was before.  Martha said that.
3033,HAMILTON,"And He said we were not to be afraid."""
3034,HAMILTON,Lazarus closed his eyes while on his face
3035,HAMILTON,A tortured adumbration of a smile
3036,HAMILTON,"Flickered an instant.  ""All as it was before,"""
3037,HAMILTON,"He murmured wearily.  ""Martha said that;"
3038,HAMILTON,And He said you were not to be afraid . . .
3039,HAMILTON,Not you . . .  Not you . . .  Why should you be afraid?
3040,HAMILTON,"Give all your little fears, and Martha's with them,"
3041,HAMILTON,"To me; and I will add them unto mine,"
3042,HAMILTON,"Like a few rain-drops to Gennesaret."""
3043,HAMILTON,
3044,HAMILTON,"""If you had frightened me in other ways,"
3045,HAMILTON,"Not willing it,"" Mary said, ""I should have known"
3046,HAMILTON,You still for Lazarus.  But who is this?
3047,HAMILTON,Tell me again that you are Lazarus;
3048,HAMILTON,And tell me if the Master gave to you
3049,HAMILTON,No sign of a new joy that shall be coming
3050,HAMILTON,To this house that He loved.  Are you afraid?
3051,HAMILTON,"Are you afraid, who have felt everything --"
3052,HAMILTON,"And seen . . . ?"""
3053,HAMILTON,
3054,HAMILTON,"But Lazarus only shook his head,"
3055,HAMILTON,Staring with his bewildered shining eyes
3056,HAMILTON,"Hard into Mary's face.  ""I do not know,"
3057,HAMILTON,"Mary,"" he said, after a long time."
3058,HAMILTON,"""When I came back, I knew the Master's eyes"
3059,HAMILTON,"Were looking into mine.  I looked at His,"
3060,HAMILTON,And there was more in them than I could see.
3061,HAMILTON,At first I could see nothing but His eyes;
3062,HAMILTON,Nothing else anywhere was to be seen --
3063,HAMILTON,Only His eyes.  And they looked into mine --
3064,HAMILTON,"Long into mine, Mary, as if He knew."""
3065,HAMILTON,
3066,HAMILTON,Mary began to be afraid of words
3067,HAMILTON,As she had never been afraid before
3068,HAMILTON,"Of loneliness or darkness, or of death,"
3069,HAMILTON,But now she must have more of them or die:
3070,HAMILTON,"""He cannot know that there is worse than death,"""
3071,HAMILTON,"She said.  ""And you . . ."""
3072,HAMILTON,
3073,HAMILTON,"""Yes, there is worse than death."""
3074,HAMILTON,"Said Lazarus; ""and that was what He knew;"
3075,HAMILTON,And that is what it was that I could see
3076,HAMILTON,"This morning in his eyes.  I was afraid,"
3077,HAMILTON,"But not as you are.  There is worse than death,"
3078,HAMILTON,Mary; and there is nothing that is good
3079,HAMILTON,For you in dying while you are still here.
3080,HAMILTON,"Mary, never go back to that again."
3081,HAMILTON,"You would not hear me if I told you more,"
3082,HAMILTON,For I should say it only in a language
3083,HAMILTON,That you are not to learn by going back.
3084,HAMILTON,To be a child again is to go forward --
3085,HAMILTON,"And that is much to know.  Many grow old,"
3086,HAMILTON,"And fade, and go away, not knowing how much"
3087,HAMILTON,"That is to know.  Mary, the night is coming,"
3088,HAMILTON,And there will soon be darkness all around you.
3089,HAMILTON,"Let us go down where Martha waits for us,"
3090,HAMILTON,"And let there be light shining in this house."""
3091,HAMILTON,
3092,HAMILTON,"He rose, but Mary would not let him go:"
3093,HAMILTON,"""Martha, when she came back from here, said only"
3094,HAMILTON,That she heard nothing.  And have you no more
3095,HAMILTON,For Mary now than you had then for Martha?
3096,HAMILTON,"Is Nothing, Lazarus, all you have for me?"
3097,HAMILTON,Was Nothing all you found where you have been?
3098,HAMILTON,"If that be so, what is there worse than that --"
3099,HAMILTON,"Or better -- if that be so?  And why should you,"
3100,HAMILTON,"With even our love, go the same dark road over?"""
3101,HAMILTON,
3102,HAMILTON,"""I could not answer that, if that were so,"""
3103,HAMILTON,"Said Lazarus, -- ""not even if I were God."
3104,HAMILTON,"Why should He care whether I came or stayed,"
3105,HAMILTON,If that were so?  Why should the Master weep --
3106,HAMILTON,"For me, or for the world, -- or save Himself"
3107,HAMILTON,"Longer for nothing?  And if that were so,"
3108,HAMILTON,Why should a few years' more mortality
3109,HAMILTON,"Make Him a fugitive where flight were needless,"
3110,HAMILTON,Had He but held his peace and given his nod
3111,HAMILTON,To an old Law that would be new as any?
3112,HAMILTON,I cannot say the answer to all that;
3113,HAMILTON,"Though I may say that He is not afraid,"
3114,HAMILTON,And that it is not for the joy there is
3115,HAMILTON,In serving an eternal Ignorance
3116,HAMILTON,Of our futility that He is here.
3117,HAMILTON,Is that what you and Martha mean by Nothing?
3118,HAMILTON,"Is that what you are fearing?  If that be so,"
3119,HAMILTON,There are more weeds than lentils in your garden.
3120,HAMILTON,And one whose weeds are laughing at his harvest
3121,HAMILTON,May as well have no garden; for not there
3122,HAMILTON,Shall he be gleaning the few bits and orts
3123,HAMILTON,"Of life that are to save him.  For my part,"
3124,HAMILTON,"I am again with you, here among shadows"
3125,HAMILTON,That will not always be so dark as this;
3126,HAMILTON,Though now I see there's yet an evil in me
3127,HAMILTON,That made me let you be afraid of me.
3128,HAMILTON,"No, I was not afraid -- not even of life."
3129,HAMILTON,I thought I was . . . I must have time for this;
3130,HAMILTON,And all the time there is will not be long.
3131,HAMILTON,I cannot tell you what the Master saw
3132,HAMILTON,This morning in my eyes.  I do not know.
3133,HAMILTON,"I cannot yet say how far I have gone,"
3134,HAMILTON,"Or why it is that I am here again,"
3135,HAMILTON,Or where the old road leads.  I do not know.
3136,HAMILTON,"I know that when I did come back, I saw"
3137,HAMILTON,His eyes again among the trees and faces --
3138,HAMILTON,Only His eyes; and they looked into mine --
3139,HAMILTON,"Long into mine -- long, long, as if He knew."""
