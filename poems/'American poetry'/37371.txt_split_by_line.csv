206,I,I
207,I,
208,I,There lay in a vale 'twixt lone mountains
209,I,"A garden entangled with flowers,"
210,I,Where the whisper of echoing fountains
211,I,Stirred softly the musk-breathing bowers.
212,I,"Where torrents cast down from rock-masses,"
213,I,"From caverns of red-granite steeps,"
214,I,With thunders sonorous clove passes
215,I,"And maddened dark gulfs with rash leaps,"
216,I,With the dolorous foam of their leaps.
217,I,
218,I,
219,II,II
220,II,
221,II,"And, oh, when the sunrays came heaping"
222,II,"The foam of those musical chasms,"
223,II,"With a scintillant dust as of diamonds,"
224,II,It seemed that white spirits were sweeping
225,II,"Down, down thro' those voluble chasms,"
226,II,Wild weeping in resonant spasms.
227,II,And the wave from the red-hearted granite
228,II,In veins rolled tumbling around;
229,II,Meandered thro' shade-haunted forests
230,II,Where many rock barriers did span it
231,II,To dash it in froth and in sound:
232,II,"Where the nights with their great moons could wan it,"
233,II,Or star its dusk stillness profound.
234,II,
235,II,
236,III,III
237,III,
238,III,And here in the night would I wander
239,III,"On woodways where fragrances kissed,"
240,III,By shadows where murmurings kissed;
241,III,And here would I tarry to ponder
242,III,When the moon in blue vales made a mist;
243,III,"Dim in forests of rank, rocking cedars,"
244,III,"Whose wildness made glad with their scent,"
245,III,Whose boughs in the tempests were bent
246,III,"Like the pennons and plumes of fierce leaders,"
247,III,In the battle all ragged and rent.
248,III,
249,III,
250,IV,IV
251,IV,
252,IV,And so when the moonshine was floating
253,IV,"Far up on the mountain's bleak head,"
254,IV,"On the uttermost foam of the torrent,"
255,IV,Would I string a wild harp while was gloating
256,IV,The moon on my blossomy bed.
257,IV,Or I lay where a fountain of blossoms
258,IV,"Rained rustling from arches aloft,"
259,IV,"From the thick-scented arbors aloft,"
260,IV,And I sang as the blossoms' white bosoms
261,IV,Pressed silk-smooth to mine and lay soft:
262,IV,"I sang as their redolence stung me,"
263,IV,"And laughed on my blossomy couch,"
264,IV,Till the fragrance and music had flung me
265,IV,"Into shadows of sleep with their touch,"
266,IV,The magic of exquisite touch....
267,IV,
268,IV,
269,V,V
270,V,
271,V,One night as I wondered and wandered
272,V,"In this my rare Aidenn of flowers,"
273,V,I saw where I lingered and pondered
274,V,A youth cast asleep mid the bowers:
275,V,"A youth on a mantle of satin,"
276,V,A poppy-red robe in the flowers.
277,V,
278,V,
279,VI,VI
280,VI,
281,VI,"So I kissed his thin eyelids full tender,"
282,VI,"I kissed his high forehead and pale,"
283,VI,I sighed as I kissed his black splendor
284,VI,"Of curls that were kissed of the gale,"
285,VI,That were moved of the balm-breathing gale.
286,VI,And he woke and cried out as if haunted:--
287,VI,"""Oh God! for one note of that song!"
288,VI,For a sob of that languishing song!
289,VI,"Whose tumult of sorrow enchanted,"
290,VI,"And swept my weak spirit along!"""
291,VI,
292,VI,
293,VII,VII
294,VII,
295,VII,Than I sate me upon the red satin
296,VII,And plunged a long look in his eyes;
297,VII,I bowed on the weft of red satin
298,VII,And kindled his love with my sighs.
299,VII,With fingers of lightness set sobbing
300,VII,"The chords of my harp in a song,"
301,VII,Till I found that my heart was a-throbbing
302,VII,"And sobbing to sing like a tongue,"
303,VII,Was sobbing to mix with the song.
304,VII,
305,VII,
306,VIII,VIII
307,VIII,
308,VIII,"Then he cried, and his dark eyes keen glistened,"
309,VIII,"""Lost! lost! for that perilous music!"
310,VIII,Oh God! for that tyrannous strain!
311,VIII,"To which in my dreams I have listened,"
312,VIII,"Ah, wretch! I have listened with pain!"""
313,VIII,And he tost on the garment of satin
314,VIII,"His deep raven darkness of hair,"
315,VIII,"And the song at my lips was ungathered,"
316,VIII,And I sate there to marvel and stare.
317,VIII,
318,VIII,
319,IX,IX
320,IX,
321,IX,Then I wrenched from my soul a wild glory
322,IX,"Of music delirious with words,"
323,IX,"Of music that wailed a soul's story,"
324,IX,"And trembled with god-uttered words,"
325,IX,Or fell like the battling of swords.
326,IX,And in with it mixed all the beauty
327,IX,"Of farewells and ravenous sighs,"
328,IX,"The heart that was broken for booty,"
329,IX,"Tears, rapture to know that one dies,"
330,IX,"Hell, heaven and laughter and cries."
331,IX,
332,IX,
333,X,X
334,X,
335,X,"In music the heart-ache of passion,"
336,X,"The terror of souls that are lost,"
337,X,"Cold, dizzying anguish of dying,"
338,X,"All torments that beauty could fashion,"
339,X,Hot manacles of love and their cost.
340,X,The bliss and the fury of dashing
341,X,"A soul into riotous love,"
342,X,While the smiting of harp-chords and crashing
343,X,Of song like the winds were enwove
344,X,With the stars that fall sounding above.

400,XIV,How I wailed to the stars of the heaven
401,XIV,How they scoffed at and answered my grief
402,XIV,"In letters of flame, ""Unforgiven!"
