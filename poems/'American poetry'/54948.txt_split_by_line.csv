53,FOREWORD.,
54,FOREWORD.,
55,FOREWORD.,The poems here collected are in the main reprints of pieces that
56,FOREWORD.,"originally appeared in various newspapers and periodicals, beginning"
57,FOREWORD.,with the Louisville Journal in the late ’50s. This newspaper was at that
58,FOREWORD.,"time edited by the brilliant George D. Prentice, my personal friend, who"
59,FOREWORD.,a few years after I had left college offered me the assistant editorship
60,FOREWORD.,of his paper. The imperative duty which at that time I owed to others
61,FOREWORD.,"forced me to decline this offer, although for many years I wrote"
62,FOREWORD.,editorials and verses for this then powerful and widely read journal.
63,FOREWORD.,Many of the poems here collected have appeared in the columns of the
64,FOREWORD.,"Louisville daily papers and have been copied in other journals, North"
65,FOREWORD.,"and South, and in poetic collections. Others were first printed in the"
66,FOREWORD.,"Nashville Press and Times, of which I was editor during my two terms as"
67,FOREWORD.,"Public Printer of Tennessee, during the administrations of Military"
68,FOREWORD.,Governor Andrew Johnson and of Governor Brownlow in the days of
69,FOREWORD.,Reconstruction.
70,FOREWORD.,
71,FOREWORD.,It will be noticed that the partisan poems breathe the spirit of the
72,FOREWORD.,times in which they were written--the stormy ’60s--but I have not
73,FOREWORD.,"thought it wise to change their tone, they being now only the record of"
74,FOREWORD.,a long-since departed day. There has been some controversy as to the
75,FOREWORD.,"authorship of the poem “The Angel of the Hospital,” owing to a"
76,FOREWORD.,manuscript copy of this poem being found on the body of a young
77,FOREWORD.,"Confederate officer killed in one of the battles in Georgia, and from"
78,FOREWORD.,which the poem was reprinted in many of the Southern newspapers. I had
79,FOREWORD.,"previously, however, printed it in the Louisville Journal, and as"
80,FOREWORD.,"newspapers were scarce in the South at that time, the unfortunate youth"
81,FOREWORD.,must have copied the verses before passing the newspaper on to his
82,FOREWORD.,comrades.

211,| S. C. MERCER |,[Illustration: THE TWO KENTUCKIANS.
212,| S. C. MERCER |,
213,| S. C. MERCER |,ABRAHAM LINCOLN--Fourteenth President of the United States; born in
214,| S. C. MERCER |,"Hardin County, Ky., February 12, 1809; assassinated in Ford’s Theater,"
215,| S. C. MERCER |,"April 16, 1865."
216,| S. C. MERCER |,
217,| S. C. MERCER |,JEFFERSON DAVIS--First and last President of the Southern Confederacy;
218,| S. C. MERCER |,"born in Christian County, Ky., June 3, 1808; died in New Orleans,"
219,| S. C. MERCER |,"December 6, 1889.]"
220,| S. C. MERCER |,
221,| S. C. MERCER |,
222,| S. C. MERCER |,The sky of the Southland with grief is o’ercast;
223,| S. C. MERCER |,Bitter tears down the cheeks of the brave trickle fast;
224,| S. C. MERCER |,The moss-streamered oaks of Beauvoir bow their head--
225,| S. C. MERCER |,"Their Master is fallen, their Chieftain is dead."
226,| S. C. MERCER |,"Wake, soldier, who liest outstretched on thy bier:"
227,| S. C. MERCER |,Does the warwhoop of Black Hawk not startle thy ear?
228,| S. C. MERCER |,Seest thou not the long Mexican lancers’ array
229,| S. C. MERCER |,At dark Buena Vista rush fierce to the fray?
230,| S. C. MERCER |,
231,| S. C. MERCER |,Hapless Mexican Cavalry! great was your scath
232,| S. C. MERCER |,As you fearlessly charged down that Angel of Death.
233,| S. C. MERCER |,"The manes of the chargers like meteors streamed,"
234,| S. C. MERCER |,Like rainbows far-flashing the gay pennons gleamed;
235,| S. C. MERCER |,Like lightning from Heaven Davis brandished his sword
236,| S. C. MERCER |,And fierce was the volley his riflemen poured;
237,| S. C. MERCER |,"They reel in their saddles, they topple and fall,"
238,| S. C. MERCER |,"The flag of the cavalcade turns to a pall,"
239,| S. C. MERCER |,Its ghostly Commander is the skeleton Death--
240,| S. C. MERCER |,The fair rose of Mexico shrinks in his breath.
241,| S. C. MERCER |,"They halt--they retreat--in wild tumult they run,"
242,| S. C. MERCER |,The eagle soars victor--Buena Vista is won.
243,| S. C. MERCER |,
244,| S. C. MERCER |,"Hearken, O spangled Cavaliers, to that dread warning cry"
245,| S. C. MERCER |,Which like the trump of Judgment is sounding from the sky--
246,| S. C. MERCER |,“Remember cruel Alamo’s foul massacre and die!”
247,| S. C. MERCER |,"Lo her avengers, Taylor, Davis, Hardin, McKee, and Clay!"
248,| S. C. MERCER |,"Abundant sacrifice went up in smoke of battle gray,"
249,| S. C. MERCER |,"So were thy Manes appeased, brave Crockett, on that day,"
250,| S. C. MERCER |,Thy phantom sped from Alamo to cheer that bloody fray.
251,| S. C. MERCER |,Our troops on that field by their valor and scars
252,| S. C. MERCER |,"Added stars to our flag’s constellation of stars,"
253,| S. C. MERCER |,And Buena Vista’s immaculate name
254,| S. C. MERCER |,Like a beacon-fire burns in the temple of fame.
255,| S. C. MERCER |,"Weep, daughters of Mexico, for lover and spouse,"
256,| S. C. MERCER |,"Hang crepe on the door of each desolate house,"
257,| S. C. MERCER |,"Long, long shall the maidens of Anahuac mourn"
258,| S. C. MERCER |,For their fallen defenders who shall never return.
259,| S. C. MERCER |,
260,| S. C. MERCER |,"Once, in Senate encounter, in battle’s fierce brunt,"
261,| S. C. MERCER |,"Thy plume, like Navarre’s, streamed full high in the front."
262,| S. C. MERCER |,"Thou wast once, like Scotch Bruce, of inflexible will,"
263,| S. C. MERCER |,"Unyielding, though conquered, and resolute still."
264,| S. C. MERCER |,"In field or in council, with sword, tongue or pen,"
265,| S. C. MERCER |,"The molder of ideas, the leader of men."
266,| S. C. MERCER |,"Clay--Webster--Oh, Chief, are thy pulses unstirred"
267,| S. C. MERCER |,When the mighty debate in the Senate is heard?
268,| S. C. MERCER |,"Hark, Sumter’s loud tocsin! Saw the world e’er the like?"
269,| S. C. MERCER |,For Freedom and Union and Southland they strike.
270,| S. C. MERCER |,"Grant, Meade, Lee and Thomas like Titans engage,"
271,| S. C. MERCER |,And the Lost Cause departs like a ghost from the stage.
272,| S. C. MERCER |,
273,| S. C. MERCER |,"’Tis past, like a dream of the dawning in air,"
274,| S. C. MERCER |,"For thee, the world’s pageant of Vanity Fair."
275,| S. C. MERCER |,"All faded--those phantoms and dreams of the past,"
276,| S. C. MERCER |,And crepe ties the flag as it falls to the mast.
277,| S. C. MERCER |,The dirge wails its sorrow to dead ears in vain;
278,| S. C. MERCER |,"The pallbearers’ flag is the flag of the train,"
279,| S. C. MERCER |,"The traveler’s baggage lies all in one chest,"
280,| S. C. MERCER |,Whose check is a coffin plate lettered “At Rest.”
281,| S. C. MERCER |,"And Metairie’s vault opes its dark, narrow berth"
282,| S. C. MERCER |,"For the cold, pallid earth which returns to the earth."
283,| S. C. MERCER |,
284,| S. C. MERCER |,As I rode o’er the mountain I saw not how high
285,| S. C. MERCER |,Its pine-covered summit ascended the sky.
286,| S. C. MERCER |,’Twas a mere undulation that rose from the plain--
287,| S. C. MERCER |,"But, as journeying on, I beheld it again,"
288,| S. C. MERCER |,The veil of Omnipotence spread like a shroud
289,| S. C. MERCER |,"On its brow, that looked down on the loftiest cloud."
290,| S. C. MERCER |,So our lives were too near to those lives which expired
291,| S. C. MERCER |,When the battle of freedom our continent fired.
292,| S. C. MERCER |,To measure their valor and virtue aright--
293,| S. C. MERCER |,Our vision is dim when too close to the light.
294,| S. C. MERCER |,
295,| S. C. MERCER |,"Thou, Lincoln, sad martyr, just, generous, brave;"
296,| S. C. MERCER |,A hero of heroes Omnipotence gave
297,| S. C. MERCER |,"To mortals in molding thy gaunt, rugged face;"
298,| S. C. MERCER |,"Like Cromwell, no smooth dilettante in grace;"
299,| S. C. MERCER |,"But counting all power, glory, life itself, naught,"
300,| S. C. MERCER |,Till the duty assigned thee by Heaven was wrought.
301,| S. C. MERCER |,
302,| S. C. MERCER |,O voice of humanity whose exquisite tone
303,| S. C. MERCER |,Like the moan of the sea breathed a sadness its own--
304,| S. C. MERCER |,"As the sea mourns the infinite dead ’neath its waves,"
305,| S. C. MERCER |,So mourned his great soul for war’s infinite graves--
306,| S. C. MERCER |,How oft did the widow and orphan rejoice
307,| S. C. MERCER |,In the counsel and sympathy toned in that voice;
308,| S. C. MERCER |,"Where sorrow abounded did his love more abound,"
309,| S. C. MERCER |,"Like the hand of a woman who nurses a wound,"
310,| S. C. MERCER |,Like the lullaby sung to a babe at the breast
311,| S. C. MERCER |,Till singer and sufferer sink to sweet rest;
312,| S. C. MERCER |,It cheered the bruised hearts of the children of toil
313,| S. C. MERCER |,Like the summer-night-dew which refreshes the soil;
314,| S. C. MERCER |,Like the Lamb of Redemption he went to the cross
315,| S. C. MERCER |,And our infinite gain was secured by his loss.
316,| S. C. MERCER |,
317,| S. C. MERCER |,No vision of conquest could lead him astray

1544,THE TEN BROTHERS.,Let others for cattle and horses seek the prize

1621,ECHO RIVER.,Adown the dark and stony arch
1622,ECHO RIVER.,Of gloomy Echo River?

1628,ECHO RIVER.,Without a smile from one lone star

1637,ECHO RIVER.,And by these weird and shadowy shores
1638,ECHO RIVER.,"Direct the dusky boatman’s oars,"
1639,ECHO RIVER.,Until yon night-enshrouded strand
1640,ECHO RIVER.,Receives our wandering pilgrim band
1641,ECHO RIVER.,
1642,ECHO RIVER.,"High towering, like the rocky walls"
1643,ECHO RIVER.,"Of the leviathan’s ocean halls,"
1644,ECHO RIVER.,Rises the overshadowing cliff
1645,ECHO RIVER.,"Above our frail but daring skiff,"
1646,ECHO RIVER.,"Which skims along this lower deep,"
1647,ECHO RIVER.,Where angry tempests never sweep
1648,ECHO RIVER.,Nor polar star affords its ray
1649,ECHO RIVER.,To steer us on our trackless way.
1650,ECHO RIVER.,"And as we slowly sail along,"
1651,ECHO RIVER.,"The plashing oar, the voice of song,"
1652,ECHO RIVER.,Caught by the Naiads of the waves
1653,ECHO RIVER.,"And echoed by the vocal caves,"
1654,ECHO RIVER.,Enchant the pleased yet startled ear
1655,ECHO RIVER.,With strains that ring as loud and clear
1656,ECHO RIVER.,As the wild mountain music--born
1657,ECHO RIVER.,"From the lone Alpine shepherd’s horn,"
1658,ECHO RIVER.,In peals so loud that they affright
1659,ECHO RIVER.,The lammergeyer on dizzy height;
1660,ECHO RIVER.,"And the bold eagle’s trumpet shriek,"
1661,ECHO RIVER.,Loud-bugled from his thunder beak
1662,ECHO RIVER.,"And echoed round from peak to peak,"
1663,ECHO RIVER.,In hollow cadence dies away
1664,ECHO RIVER.,"Along the mountain river,"

1680,ECHO RIVER.,’Tis gone! and now a sad farewell
1681,ECHO RIVER.,Unto the listening waves we tell;
1682,ECHO RIVER.,Softer than midnight serenade
1683,ECHO RIVER.,Sung to the ears of Spanish maid
1684,ECHO RIVER.,By the blue Guadalquiver!
1685,ECHO RIVER.,Plaintive and sweet as “Dixie”‘s air
1686,ECHO RIVER.,Of sadness which is not despair
1687,ECHO RIVER.,And ravishes the enchanted ear
1688,ECHO RIVER.,Of home-returning volunteer--
1689,ECHO RIVER.,"By his dear Bluegrass maiden sung,"
1690,ECHO RIVER.,To mandolin with silver tongue.
1691,ECHO RIVER.,And witching is the fond adieu
1692,ECHO RIVER.,The voice of beauty sings to you--
1693,ECHO RIVER.,"O, music-murmuring river!"
1694,ECHO RIVER.,"For one, whose eyes and flowing locks"
1695,ECHO RIVER.,Are darker than the raven’s wing
1696,ECHO RIVER.,"Of midnight, brooding o’er yon rocks,"
1697,ECHO RIVER.,"Touches the plaintive sounding string,"
1698,ECHO RIVER.,And pours a melancholy song
1699,ECHO RIVER.,"That floats the vocal stream along,"
1700,ECHO RIVER.,"Sad as the convent’s vesper hymn,"
1701,ECHO RIVER.,"Chanted by nuns, at twilight dim,"
1702,ECHO RIVER.,"Or that strange harp, whose magic tone"
1703,ECHO RIVER.,"So wildly sweet, so sad and lone,"
1704,ECHO RIVER.,"To mortal minstrel never known,"
1705,ECHO RIVER.,On night winds wafts its hollow moan.
1706,ECHO RIVER.,The ravished Genii of the waves
1707,ECHO RIVER.,Repeat the story through the caves;
1708,ECHO RIVER.,"And far along the tuneful flood,"
1709,ECHO RIVER.,A never-ending multitude
1710,ECHO RIVER.,Of echoing Ariels take their flight
1711,ECHO RIVER.,Far down the dark aisles of the night.
1712,ECHO RIVER.,
1713,ECHO RIVER.,"If, when our throbbing hearts are still,"
1714,ECHO RIVER.,"And pulseless lies the icy hand,"
1715,ECHO RIVER.,Reality should then fulfill
1716,ECHO RIVER.,"Our dreamings of a brighter land,"
1717,ECHO RIVER.,"Then may the unfettered spirit’s ear,"

1720,ECHO RIVER.,"Float through the bowers of Paradise,"
1721,ECHO RIVER.,That bloom serene forever.
1722,ECHO RIVER.,"While wafted home to rest, we dream."
1723,ECHO RIVER.,"By Eden’s clear, ambrosial stream,"
1724,ECHO RIVER.,That clouds o’ershadow never.
1725,ECHO RIVER.,"We part! But O, who would not grieve"
1726,ECHO RIVER.,This world of melody to leave?
1727,ECHO RIVER.,For round our hearts a witching spell
1728,ECHO RIVER.,"Lingers and whispers low, “Farewell!”"
1729,ECHO RIVER.,Like the low moan of ocean shell.
1730,ECHO RIVER.,"Or midnight chime of distant bell,"
1731,ECHO RIVER.,"The torches, dancing to and fro,"
1732,ECHO RIVER.,Cast in long lines their golden glow
1733,ECHO RIVER.,"Over the inky surge’s flow,"
1734,ECHO RIVER.,Like arrows from Apollo’s bow
1735,ECHO RIVER.,Or Dian’s starry quiver!
1736,ECHO RIVER.,"And like an anthem from the skies,"

1752,THE ANGEL OF THE HOSPITAL.,Ah! woe is me! No ringing cry of “Charge!”
1753,THE ANGEL OF THE HOSPITAL.,"Stirs the hot, sulphurous air. The parting groan,"

1871,THE TWO SINGERS.,Two singers sat on New Year’s eve
1872,THE TWO SINGERS.,By the blaze of a flickering fire.
1873,THE TWO SINGERS.,"“The old year is burning out,” said one"
1874,THE TWO SINGERS.,“Like the embers of our own life’s fire;
1875,THE TWO SINGERS.,"As the fire’s blaze are our passing days,"
1876,THE TWO SINGERS.,As the year shall our lives be o’er;
1877,THE TWO SINGERS.,Let us sing a rhyme to the passing year
1878,THE TWO SINGERS.,Ere we shall rhyme no more.”
1879,THE TWO SINGERS.,
1880,THE TWO SINGERS.,"The elder rhymer, heavy of heart,"
1881,THE TWO SINGERS.,Cried “Life is a thankless task.
1882,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Its loves and its hate, its Church and State,"
1883,THE TWO SINGERS.,Are only a hollow mask.
1884,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Honor, and love, and rank and fame,"
1885,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Are chaff and idle words,"
1886,THE TWO SINGERS.,And the schemes of men and the hopes of youth
1887,THE TWO SINGERS.,Are the chatter of silly birds.
1888,THE TWO SINGERS.,
1889,THE TWO SINGERS.,“Thus runs my rhyme:--The Ferryman Time
1890,THE TWO SINGERS.,"With his ever-waning glass,"
1891,THE TWO SINGERS.,Has laid on his bier another year
1892,THE TWO SINGERS.,And sung his Midnight Mass.
1893,THE TWO SINGERS.,From the oak wood dim rose a funeral hymn
1894,THE TWO SINGERS.,"As earth bewailed the dead,"
1895,THE TWO SINGERS.,And the seas made moan through every zone
1896,THE TWO SINGERS.,As the souls to Judgment fled.
1897,THE TWO SINGERS.,
1898,THE TWO SINGERS.,“The Ferryman stands on the sable sands

1900,THE TWO SINGERS.,Not a starry eye from the stormy sky

1902,THE TWO SINGERS.,But a hopeless wail filled the winter gale
1903,THE TWO SINGERS.,"As the phantom guests rushed in,"
1904,THE TWO SINGERS.,"And fear and despair, and doubt were there,"
1905,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Hopes baffled, and woe and sin."
1906,THE TWO SINGERS.,
1907,THE TWO SINGERS.,“Ambition told how his palace fell
1908,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Whose turrets braved the clouds,"
1909,THE TWO SINGERS.,His royal guests changed their courtly robes
1910,THE TWO SINGERS.,For pale and ghostly shrouds.
1911,THE TWO SINGERS.,"His banquet hall is tenantless,"
1912,THE TWO SINGERS.,Unstrung is the minstrel’s viol--
1913,THE TWO SINGERS.,Not a sound to greet but the pendulum’s beat
1914,THE TWO SINGERS.,Of the lone monotonous dial.
1915,THE TWO SINGERS.,
1916,THE TWO SINGERS.,“Genius proclaimed how folly’s scorn
1917,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Robbed his nights and days of rest,"

1919,THE TWO SINGERS.,Was the life-blood of his breast.
1920,THE TWO SINGERS.,"Bright were the gleams that lit his dreams,"

1929,THE TWO SINGERS.,"The essence she of purity,"

2706,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Her grandma had left her a very fine leg-

2717,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Sprang quick to her feet at the terrible squall,"
2718,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"There pale as the Greek Slave of Powers she stood,"
2719,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Her white lips unstained by a vestige of blood,"
2720,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Her arms, like a Pythoness, in agony tossed,"
2721,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"As she shrieked in her anguish, “O Lord, I am lost!”"
2722,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,
2723,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,While footsteps fell round her as quick as the clatter
2724,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Of a cavalcade’s hoofs, each one bawling at her"
2725,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"“O Lulu, my darling, pray what is the matter?”"
2726,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,“A serpent is biting me under my dress!”
2727,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"“Lord help us!” burst forth in a wail of distress,"
2728,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"“It’s coiling around my--It’s big as a rail,"
2729,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"And a great bunch of rattles tied on to its tail,”"
2730,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Ne’er toper saw snake from his jag or his jug
2731,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Like this which clasped Lulu in terrible hug.
2732,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,
2733,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"There were sobbings and swooning away on the floor,"
2734,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Of disordered lingerie over a score,"
2735,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"“Unions,” “Merodes,” and garters galore,"
2736,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Indeed ’twas a contretemps all might deplore!
2737,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,“A snake at a dance!” “How dare poke its face
2738,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Into such an exceedingly improper place?”
2739,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,So the old snake in Paradise brought us to grief;
2740,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"He skulked behind Eve; Eve behind her fig leaf,"
2741,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"And this great world, which it took a whole week to make,"
2742,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Went into bankruptcy, all for one snake."
2743,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,
2744,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"O Fashion, what follies your votaries make,"
2745,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"What frauds to your bosom with rapture you take,"
2746,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"’Twixt the gay masquerade and the sorrowful wake,"
2747,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"One tenth is for fashion and nine tenths for mere fake,"
2748,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,And maidens adorn their fair forms with a snake;
2749,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"For earrings, for bracelets, for necklace and jewel,"
2750,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Diamonds and rubies for eyes cold and cruel.
2751,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Sparkling and dazzling at reception and mass,"
2752,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"On debutante’s fingers or on widow of grass,"
2753,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"O! feminine dragon!--how else depict her,"
2754,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,When the girl of my dreams turns boa-constrictor?
2755,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Why pineth fair woman’s heart for a snake?
2756,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,Man would perish a million times o’er for her sake.
2757,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,
2758,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"At last one golden youth, more bold than the rest,"
2759,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Walked up, bowed and spoke as he pulled down his vest"
2760,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"“Well! crying won’t help it, so pray now be still,"
2761,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"They say there’s a way whene’er there’s a will,"
2762,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"I will tie up his tail in a sort of a link,"
2763,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"And jerk him from under his quarters, I think,”"
2764,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Dread silence fell like a spell on the air,"
2765,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Sobs hardly suppressed, inarticulate prayer,"
2766,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"When cautiously groping lest he might mistake,"
2767,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"And grab a--suspender instead of the snake,"
2768,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"He at last found the dragon and fastened his hold,"
2769,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"It was scaly and squirming, and quivering and cold,"
2770,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"Like a huge anaconda writhing its fold,"
2771,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"And then with a clutch that was steady and bold,"
2772,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,"He twisted it up in a sort of a loop,"
2773,THE DRESS CIRCLE.,And jerked out--at least forty feet of steel hoop!

2842,II.,"Sooth but he was a gallant knight,"
2843,II.,Fond of his lager and fond of fight.
2844,II.,He was ever in the front

2858,III.,Her breath was sweet

2862,III.,Her foot was cased

2865,III.,"Made of the finest Parisian calf,"
2866,III.,"So instead of walking,"
2867,III.,"Of course she flew,"

2891,IV.,Who lived in the gloomy castle
2892,IV.,That stood by the Rhine’s blue water.
2893,IV.,"Oh, Kleinfelter burned with a desperate passion,"
2894,IV.,And he fixed it in music somewhat to this fashion:
2895,IV.,"“Oh transcendental Hinda,"
2896,IV.,"Look from thy latticed window,"
2897,IV.,As here I sadly linger
2898,IV.,And with a trembling finger
2899,IV.,I thrum the strings
2900,IV.,"Of my sad guitar,"
2901,IV.,Or knock the ashes
2902,IV.,From my fragrant cigar
2903,IV.,"Fairest of Heaven’s handiwork,"
2904,IV.,"Sweetest of nature’s candy-work,"
2905,IV.,"Here I pledge upon thine altar,"
2906,IV.,Love that knows not how to falter.
2907,IV.,"Grant, oh, grant some sweet return,"
2908,IV.,Nor my deep devotion spurn;
2909,IV.,Let me have thy gentle heart or
2910,IV.,Even a buckle of your garter!”
2911,IV.,
2912,IV.,
2913,V.,V.
2914,V.,
2915,V.,Now Kleinfelter’s singing
2916,V.,"Was undoubtedly splendid,"
2917,V.,And its musical ringing
2918,V.,Could not easily be mended
2919,V.,It was soft and sweet and then it was loud
2920,V.,As a singing saint’s on a shining cloud;
2921,V.,"Clear as the lark’s own morning call,"
2922,V.,With a silvery chime like a waterfall.
2923,V.,"So he had scarcely uttered a note,"
2924,V.,"When Hinda’s heart rose up in her throat,"
2925,V.,"Her breast felt a pang and her head felt a dizziness,"

2930,VI.,
2931,VI.,"I know a maiden,"

2934,VI.,"Of the tempest’s rack,"
2935,VI.,And the radiant glow
2936,VI.,Of their glorious fire
2937,VI.,Would quell and tame
2938,VI.,A lion’s ire.
2939,VI.,Sometimes they brighten
2940,VI.,"And lighten in gladness,"
2941,VI.,Sometimes their dark depths
2942,VI.,"Are shadowed with sadness,"
2943,VI.,"But pensive or mirthful,"
2944,VI.,"A soul flashes through,"
2945,VI.,That will silently charm you
2946,VI.,And win and subdue.
2947,VI.,Often have I heard her play
2948,VI.,"On the guitar some roundelay,"
2949,VI.,"And as her white hands swept the strings,"
2950,VI.,"Melody unsealed its springs,"
2951,VI.,"And her sweet voice, though low and soft,"
2952,VI.,"Rose like a seraph’s hymn aloft,"
2953,VI.,Rising and sinking in gentle swells;
2954,VI.,"Like a murmuring brook with its liquid bells,"
2955,VI.,Till the vanquished soul was borne along
2956,VI.,On the rushing tide of resistless song.
2957,VI.,
2958,VI.,
2959,VII.,VII.
2960,VII.,
2961,VII.,But I am digressing--
2962,VII.,"I was going to say,"
2963,VII.,That just as Kleinfelter
2964,VII.,"Got in good way,"
2965,VII.,"The Baron, hearing Kleinfelter’s song,"
2966,VII.,"Thought he was piling it on rather strong,"
2967,VII.,"So taking along a burly old vassal,"
2968,VII.,He quickly sneaked up to the top of his castle
2969,VII.,He lay down on his stomach
2970,VII.,"And stuck his head over,"
2971,VII.,And there was Miss Hinda
2972,VII.,And below was her lover.
2973,VII.,"He gritted his teeth and he held his breath,"
2974,VII.,And he inly vowed Kleinfelter’s death.
2975,VII.,"So jumping up and wheeling about,"
2976,VII.,"He picked up a barrel of sour kraut,"
2977,VII.,"And frantic with rage he hurled it over,"
2978,VII.,Plump on the head of the wretched lover.
2979,VII.,"Of course it ended Kleinfelter’s strains,"
2980,VII.,"For it mashed his skull and scattered his brains,"
2981,VII.,And knocked the musician _out of time_
2982,VII.,Into Eternity--horrible crime!
2983,VII.,"So ended Kleinfelter, and so ends my rhyme."
