195,I,and spring--a matter of a few days
196,I,"only,--a flower or two picked"
197,I,from mud or from among wet leaves
198,I,or at best against treacherous
199,I,"bitterness of wind, and sky shining"

209,II,stript of the polished stone
210,II,that used to guard them!
211,II,"March,"
212,II,you are like Fra Angelico
213,II,"at Fiesole, painting on plaster!"
214,II,
215,II,"March,"
216,II,you are like a band of
217,II,young poets that have not learned
218,II,the blessedness of warmth
219,II,(or have forgotten it).
220,II,
221,II,At any rate--
222,II,I am moved to write poetry
223,II,for the warmth there is in it
224,II,and for the loneliness--
225,II,a poem that shall have you
226,II,in it March.

234,III,in blue and yellow enamel!
235,III,with drawn bow--facing lions
236,III,"standing on their hind legs,"
237,III,fangs bared! his shafts
238,III,bristling in their necks!
239,III,
240,III,Sacred bulls--dragons
241,III,in embossed brickwork
242,III,marching--in four tiers--
243,III,along the sacred way to
244,III,Nebuchadnezzar's throne hall!
245,III,"They shine in the sun,"
246,III,they that have been marching--
247,III,marching under the dust of
248,III,ten thousand dirt years.
249,III,
250,III,Now--
251,III,they are coming into bloom again!
252,III,See them!
253,III,"marching still, bared by"
254,III,the storms from my calendar
255,III,--winds that blow back the sand!
256,III,winds that enfilade dirt!
257,III,winds that by strange craft
258,III,have whipt up a black army
259,III,that by pick and shovel
260,III,bare a procession to
261,III,"the god, Marduk!"
262,III,
263,III,Natives cursing and digging
264,III,for pay unearth dragons with
265,III,upright tails and sacred bulls
266,III,alternately--
267,III,in four tiers--
268,III,lining the way to an old altar!
269,III,Natives digging at old walls--
270,III,digging me warmth--digging me
271,III,sweet loneliness--
272,III,high enamelled walls.
273,III,

276,IV,
277,IV,My second spring--
278,IV,passed in a monastery
279,IV,with plaster walls--in Fiesole
280,IV,on the hill above Florence.
281,IV,
282,IV,My second spring--painted
283,IV,a virgin--in a blue aureole
284,IV,"sitting on a three-legged stool,"
285,IV,arms crossed--
286,IV,"she is intently serious,"
287,IV,and still
288,IV,watching an angel
289,IV,with coloured wings
290,IV,half kneeling before her--
291,IV,and smiling--the angel's eyes
292,IV,holding the eyes of Mary
293,IV,as a snake's holds a bird's.
294,IV,"On the ground there are flowers,"
295,IV,trees are in leaf.
296,IV,
297,IV,
298,V,V
299,V,
300,V,But! now for the battle!
301,V,Now for murder--now for the real thing!
302,V,My third springtime is approaching!
303,V,Winds!
304,V,"lean, serious as a virgin,"
305,V,"seeking, seeking the flowers of March."
306,V,
307,V,Seeking
308,V,"flowers nowhere to be found,"
309,V,they twine among the bare branches
310,V,in insatiable eagerness--
311,V,they whirl up the snow
312,V,seeking under it--
313,V,they--the winds--snakelike
314,V,roar among yellow reeds
315,V,seeking flowers--flowers.
316,V,
317,V,I spring among them
318,V,seeking one flower
319,V,in which to warm myself!
320,V,
321,V,I deride with all the ridicule
322,V,of misery--
323,V,my own starved misery.
324,V,
325,V,Counter-cutting winds
326,V,strike against me
327,V,refreshing their fury!
328,V,
329,V,"Come, good, cold fellows!"
330,V,Have we no flowers?
331,V,Defy then with even more
332,V,desperation than ever--being
333,V,lean and frozen!
334,V,
335,V,But though you are lean and frozen--
336,V,think of the blue bulls of Babylon.
337,V,
338,V,Fling yourselves upon
339,V,their empty roses--
340,V,cut savagely!
341,V,
342,V,But--
343,V,think of the painted monastery
344,V,at Fiesole.

349,BERKET AND THE STARS,BERKET AND THE STARS
350,BERKET AND THE STARS,
351,BERKET AND THE STARS,
352,BERKET AND THE STARS,A day on the boulevards chosen out of ten years of
353,BERKET AND THE STARS,student poverty! One best day out of ten good ones.
354,BERKET AND THE STARS,"Berket in high spirits--""Ha, oranges! Let's have one!"""
355,BERKET AND THE STARS,And he made to snatch an orange from the vender's cart.
356,BERKET AND THE STARS,
357,BERKET AND THE STARS,"Now so clever was the deception, so nicely timed"
358,BERKET AND THE STARS,"to the full sweep of certain wave summits,"
359,BERKET AND THE STARS,that the rumor of the thing has come down through
360,BERKET AND THE STARS,three generations--which is relatively forever!

365,A CELEBRATION,A CELEBRATION
366,A CELEBRATION,
367,A CELEBRATION,
368,A CELEBRATION,"A middle-northern March, now as always--"
369,A CELEBRATION,gusts from the south broken against cold winds--
370,A CELEBRATION,"but from under, as if a slow hand lifted a tide,"
371,A CELEBRATION,"it moves--not into April--into a second March,"
372,A CELEBRATION,the old skin of wind-clear scales dropping
373,A CELEBRATION,upon the mould: this is the shadow projects the tree
374,A CELEBRATION,upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere.
375,A CELEBRATION,
376,A CELEBRATION,So we will put on our pink felt hat--new last year!
377,A CELEBRATION,--newer this by virtue of brown eyes turning back
378,A CELEBRATION,"the seasons--and let us walk to the orchid-house,"
379,A CELEBRATION,see the flowers will take the prize to-morrow
380,A CELEBRATION,at the Palace.
381,A CELEBRATION,"Stop here, these are our oleanders."
382,A CELEBRATION,When they are in bloom--
383,A CELEBRATION,You would waste words
384,A CELEBRATION,It is clearer to me than if the pink
385,A CELEBRATION,were on the branch. It would be a searching in
386,A CELEBRATION,"a coloured cloud to reveal that which now, huskless,"
387,A CELEBRATION,shows the very reason for their being.
388,A CELEBRATION,
389,A CELEBRATION,"And these the orange-trees, in blossom--no need"
390,A CELEBRATION,to tell with this weight of perfume in the air.
391,A CELEBRATION,If it were not so dark in this shed one could better
392,A CELEBRATION,see the white.
393,A CELEBRATION,It is that very perfume
394,A CELEBRATION,has drawn the darkness down among the leaves.
395,A CELEBRATION,Do I speak clearly enough?
396,A CELEBRATION,It is this darkness reveals that which darkness alone
397,A CELEBRATION,loosens and sets spinning on waxen wings--
398,A CELEBRATION,"not the touch of a finger-tip, not the motion"
399,A CELEBRATION,of a sigh. A too heavy sweetness proves
400,A CELEBRATION,its own caretaker.
401,A CELEBRATION,And here are the orchids!
402,A CELEBRATION,Never having seen
403,A CELEBRATION,such gaiety I will read these flowers for you:
404,A CELEBRATION,"This is an odd January, died--in Villon's time."
405,A CELEBRATION,"Snow, this is and this the stain of a violet"
406,A CELEBRATION,grew in that place the spring that foresaw its own doom.
407,A CELEBRATION,
408,A CELEBRATION,"And this, a certain July from Iceland:"
409,A CELEBRATION,a young woman of that place
410,A CELEBRATION,breathed it toward the south. It took root there.
411,A CELEBRATION,The colour ran true but the plant is small.
412,A CELEBRATION,
413,A CELEBRATION,This falling spray of snowflakes is
414,A CELEBRATION,a handful of dead Februarys
415,A CELEBRATION,prayed into flower by Rafael Arevalo Martinez
416,A CELEBRATION,of Guatemala.
417,A CELEBRATION,Here's that old friend who
418,A CELEBRATION,"went by my side so many years: this full, fragile"
419,A CELEBRATION,head of veined lavender. Oh that April
420,A CELEBRATION,that we first went with our stiff lusts
421,A CELEBRATION,"leaving the city behind, out to the green hill--"
422,A CELEBRATION,"May, they said she was. A hand for all of us:"
423,A CELEBRATION,this branch of blue butterflies tied to this stem.
424,A CELEBRATION,
425,A CELEBRATION,June is a yellow cup I'll not name; August
426,A CELEBRATION,the over-heavy one. And here are--
427,A CELEBRATION,"russet and shiny, all but March. And March?"
428,A CELEBRATION,"Ah, March--"
429,A CELEBRATION,Flowers are a tiresome pastime.
430,A CELEBRATION,One has a wish to shake them from their pots
431,A CELEBRATION,"root and stern, for the sun to gnaw."
432,A CELEBRATION,
433,A CELEBRATION,Walk out again into the cold and saunter home
434,A CELEBRATION,to the fire. This day has blossomed long enough.
435,A CELEBRATION,I have wiped out the red night and lit a blaze
436,A CELEBRATION,instead which will at least warm our hands
437,A CELEBRATION,and stir up the talk.
438,A CELEBRATION,I think we have kept fair time.
439,A CELEBRATION,Time is a green orchid.

446,APRIL,
447,APRIL,If you had come away with me
448,APRIL,into another state
449,APRIL,we had been quiet together.
450,APRIL,But there the sun coming up
451,APRIL,out of the nothing beyond the lake was
452,APRIL,"too low in the sky,"
453,APRIL,there was too great a pushing
454,APRIL,"against him,"
455,APRIL,"too much of sumac buds, pink"
456,APRIL,in the head
457,APRIL,"with the clear gum upon them,"
458,APRIL,too many opening hearts of
459,APRIL,"lilac leaves,"
460,APRIL,"too many, too many swollen"
461,APRIL,limp poplar tassels on the
462,APRIL,bare branches!
463,APRIL,It was too strong in the air.
464,APRIL,I had no rest against that
465,APRIL,springtime!
466,APRIL,The pounding of the hoofs on the
467,APRIL,raw sods
468,APRIL,stayed with me half through the night.
469,APRIL,I awoke smiling but tired.

474,A GOODNIGHT,A GOODNIGHT
475,A GOODNIGHT,
476,A GOODNIGHT,
477,A GOODNIGHT,Go to sleep--though of course you will not--
478,A GOODNIGHT,to tideless waves thundering slantwise against
479,A GOODNIGHT,"strong embankments, rattle and swish of spray"
480,A GOODNIGHT,"dashed thirty feet high, caught by the lake wind,"
481,A GOODNIGHT,scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady
482,A GOODNIGHT,"car rails! Sleep, sleep! Gulls' cries in a wind-gust"
483,A GOODNIGHT,broken by the wind; calculating wings set above
484,A GOODNIGHT,the field of waves breaking.
485,A GOODNIGHT,"Go to sleep to the lunge between foam-crests,"
486,A GOODNIGHT,refuse churned in the recoil. Food! Food!
487,A GOODNIGHT,"Offal! Offal! that holds them in the air, wave-white"
488,A GOODNIGHT,"for the one purpose, feather upon feather, the wild"
489,A GOODNIGHT,"chill in their eyes, the hoarseness in their voices--"
490,A GOODNIGHT,"sleep, sleep...."
491,A GOODNIGHT,
492,A GOODNIGHT,Gentlefooted crowds are treading out your lullaby.
493,A GOODNIGHT,"Their arms nudge, they brush shoulders,"
494,A GOODNIGHT,"hitch this way then that, mass and surge at the crossings--"
495,A GOODNIGHT,"lullaby, lullaby! The wild-fowl police whistles,"
496,A GOODNIGHT,"the enraged roar of the traffic, machine shrieks:"
497,A GOODNIGHT,"it is all to put you to sleep,"
498,A GOODNIGHT,"to soften your limbs in relaxed postures,"
499,A GOODNIGHT,"and that your head slip sidewise, and your hair loosen"
500,A GOODNIGHT,"and fall over your eyes and over your mouth,"
501,A GOODNIGHT,"brushing your lips wistfully that you may dream,"
502,A GOODNIGHT,sleep and dream--
503,A GOODNIGHT,
504,A GOODNIGHT,A black fungus springs out about lonely church doors--
505,A GOODNIGHT,"sleep, sleep. The Night, coming down upon"
506,A GOODNIGHT,"the wet boulevard, would start you awake with his"
507,A GOODNIGHT,"message, to have in at your window. Pay no"
508,A GOODNIGHT,heed to him. He storms at your sill with
509,A GOODNIGHT,"cooings, with gesticulations, curses!"
510,A GOODNIGHT,You will not let him in. He would keep you from sleeping.
511,A GOODNIGHT,He would have you sit under your desk lamp
512,A GOODNIGHT,"brooding, pondering; he would have you"
513,A GOODNIGHT,"slide out the drawer, take up the ornamented dagger"
514,A GOODNIGHT,"and handle it. It is late, it is nineteen-nineteen--"
515,A GOODNIGHT,"go to sleep, his cries are a lullaby;"
516,A GOODNIGHT,his jabbering is a sleep-well-my-baby; he is
517,A GOODNIGHT,a crackbrained messenger.
518,A GOODNIGHT,
519,A GOODNIGHT,The maid waking you in the morning
520,A GOODNIGHT,"when you are up and dressing,"
521,A GOODNIGHT,the rustle of your clothes as you raise them--
522,A GOODNIGHT,it is the same tune.
523,A GOODNIGHT,"At table the cold, greenish, split grapefruit, its juice"
524,A GOODNIGHT,"on the tongue, the clink of the spoon in"
525,A GOODNIGHT,"your coffee, the toast odors say it over and over."
526,A GOODNIGHT,
527,A GOODNIGHT,The open street-door lets in the breath of
528,A GOODNIGHT,the morning wind from over the lake.
529,A GOODNIGHT,The bus coming to a halt grinds from its sullen brakes--
530,A GOODNIGHT,"lullaby, lullaby. The crackle of a newspaper,"
531,A GOODNIGHT,the movement of the troubled coat beside you--
532,A GOODNIGHT,"sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep...."
533,A GOODNIGHT,"It is the sting of snow, the burning liquor of"
534,A GOODNIGHT,"the moonlight, the rush of rain in the gutters packed"
535,A GOODNIGHT,"with dead leaves: go to sleep, go to sleep."
536,A GOODNIGHT,And the night passes--and never passes--

544,I,I
545,I,
546,I,Men with picked voices chant the names
547,I,of cities in a huge gallery: promises
548,I,that pull through descending stairways
549,I,to a deep rumbling.
550,I,The rubbing feet
551,I,of those coming to be carried quicken a
552,I,grey pavement into soft light that rocks
553,I,"to and fro, under the domed ceiling,"
554,I,across and across from pale
555,I,earthcoloured walls of bare limestone.
556,I,
557,I,Covertly the hands of a great clock
558,I,go round and round! Were they to
559,I,move quickly and at once the whole
560,I,secret would be out and the shuffling
561,I,of all ants be done forever.
562,I,
563,I,"A leaning pyramid of sunlight, narrowing"
564,I,"out at a high window, moves by the clock:"
565,I,disaccordant hands straining out from
566,I,a center: inevitable postures infinitely
567,I,repeated--
568,I,
569,I,
570,II,II
571,II,
572,II,Two--twofour--twoeight!
573,II,Porters in red hats run on narrow platforms.
574,II,This way ma'm!
575,II,--important not to take
576,II,the wrong train!
577,II,Lights from the concrete
578,II,ceiling hang crooked but--
579,II,Poised horizontal
580,II,on glittering parallels the dingy cylinders
581,II,packed with a warm glow--inviting entry--
582,II,pull against the hour. But brakes can
583,II,hold a fixed posture till--
584,II,The whistle!
585,II,
586,II,Not twoeight. Not twofour. Two!
587,II,
588,II,Gliding windows. Colored cooks sweating
589,II,in a small kitchen. Taillights--
590,II,
591,II,In time: twofour!
592,II,In time: twoeight!
593,II,
594,II,--rivers are tunneled: trestles
595,II,cross oozy swampland: wheels repeating
596,II,the same gesture remain relatively
597,II,stationary: rails forever parallel
598,II,return on themselves infinitely.
599,II,The dance is sure.

605,ROMANCE MODERNE,
606,ROMANCE MODERNE,
607,ROMANCE MODERNE,Tracks of rain and light linger in
608,ROMANCE MODERNE,the spongy greens of a nature whose
609,ROMANCE MODERNE,"flickering mountain--bulging nearer,"
610,ROMANCE MODERNE,ebbing back into the sun
611,ROMANCE MODERNE,"hollowing itself away to hold a lake,--"
612,ROMANCE MODERNE,or brown stream rising and falling
613,ROMANCE MODERNE,"at the roadside, turning about,"
614,ROMANCE MODERNE,"churning itself white, drawing"
615,ROMANCE MODERNE,"green in over it,--plunging glassy funnels"
616,ROMANCE MODERNE,fall--
617,ROMANCE MODERNE,And--the other world--
618,ROMANCE MODERNE,the windshield a blunt barrier:
619,ROMANCE MODERNE,Talk to me. Sh! they would hear us.
620,ROMANCE MODERNE,--the backs of their heads facing us--
621,ROMANCE MODERNE,The stream continues its motion of
622,ROMANCE MODERNE,a hound running over rough ground.
623,ROMANCE MODERNE,
624,ROMANCE MODERNE,Trees vanish--reappear--vanish:
625,ROMANCE MODERNE,detached dance of gnomes--as a talk
626,ROMANCE MODERNE,"dodging remarks, glows and fades."
627,ROMANCE MODERNE,--The unseen power of words--
628,ROMANCE MODERNE,And now that a few of the moves
629,ROMANCE MODERNE,are clear the first desire is
630,ROMANCE MODERNE,to fling oneself out at the side into
631,ROMANCE MODERNE,"the other dance, to other music."
632,ROMANCE MODERNE,Peer Gynt. Rip Van Winkle. Diana.
633,ROMANCE MODERNE,
634,ROMANCE MODERNE,If I were young I would try a new alignment--
635,ROMANCE MODERNE,"alight nimbly from the car, Good-bye!--"
636,ROMANCE MODERNE,Childhood companions linked two and two
637,ROMANCE MODERNE,"criss-cross: four, three, two, one."
638,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Back into self, tentacles withdrawn."
639,ROMANCE MODERNE,Feel about in warm self-flesh.
640,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Since childhood, since childhood!"
641,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Childhood is a toad in the garden, a"
642,ROMANCE MODERNE,happy toad. All toads are happy
643,ROMANCE MODERNE,and belong in gardens. A toad to Diana!
644,ROMANCE MODERNE,
645,ROMANCE MODERNE,Lean forward. Punch the steersman
646,ROMANCE MODERNE,behind the ear. Twirl the wheel!
647,ROMANCE MODERNE,Over the edge! Screams! Crash!
648,ROMANCE MODERNE,The end. I sit above my head--
649,ROMANCE MODERNE,a little removed--or
650,ROMANCE MODERNE,a thin wash of rain on the roadway
651,ROMANCE MODERNE,"--I am never afraid when he is driving,--"
652,ROMANCE MODERNE,"interposes new direction,"
653,ROMANCE MODERNE,"rides us sidewise, unforseen"
654,ROMANCE MODERNE,into the ditch! All threads cut!
655,ROMANCE MODERNE,Death! Black. The end. The very end--
656,ROMANCE MODERNE,
657,ROMANCE MODERNE,I would sit separate weighing a
658,ROMANCE MODERNE,"small red handful: the dirt of these parts,"
659,ROMANCE MODERNE,sliding mists sheeting the alders
660,ROMANCE MODERNE,against the touch of fingers creeping
661,ROMANCE MODERNE,to mine. All stuff of the blind emotions.
662,ROMANCE MODERNE,"But--stirred, the eye seizes"
663,ROMANCE MODERNE,for the first time--The eye awake!--
664,ROMANCE MODERNE,"anything, a dirt bank with green stars"
665,ROMANCE MODERNE,of scrawny weed flattened upon it under
666,ROMANCE MODERNE,a weight of air--For the first time!--
667,ROMANCE MODERNE,or a yawning depth: Big!
668,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Swim around in it, through it--"
669,ROMANCE MODERNE,all directions and find
670,ROMANCE MODERNE,vitreous seawater stuff--
671,ROMANCE MODERNE,"God how I love you!--or, as I say,"
672,ROMANCE MODERNE,a plunge into the ditch. The end. I sit
673,ROMANCE MODERNE,examining my red handful. Balancing
674,ROMANCE MODERNE,--this--in and out--agh.
675,ROMANCE MODERNE,
676,ROMANCE MODERNE,Love you? It's
677,ROMANCE MODERNE,"a fire in the blood, willy-nilly!"
678,ROMANCE MODERNE,It's the sun coming up in the morning.
679,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Ha, but it's the grey moon too, already up"
680,ROMANCE MODERNE,in the morning. You are slow.
681,ROMANCE MODERNE,Men are not friends where it concerns
682,ROMANCE MODERNE,a woman? Fighters. Playfellows.
683,ROMANCE MODERNE,White round thighs! Youth! Sighs--!
684,ROMANCE MODERNE,It's the fillip of novelty. It's--
685,ROMANCE MODERNE,
686,ROMANCE MODERNE,Mountains. Elephants humping along
687,ROMANCE MODERNE,against the sky--indifferent to
688,ROMANCE MODERNE,"light withdrawing its tattered shreds,"
689,ROMANCE MODERNE,worn out with embraces. It's
690,ROMANCE MODERNE,the fillip of novelty. It's a fire in the blood.
691,ROMANCE MODERNE,
692,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Oh get a flannel shirt, white flannel"
693,ROMANCE MODERNE,or pongee. You'd look so well!
694,ROMANCE MODERNE,I married you because I liked your nose.
695,ROMANCE MODERNE,I wanted you! I wanted you
696,ROMANCE MODERNE,in spite of all they'd say--
697,ROMANCE MODERNE,
698,ROMANCE MODERNE,"Rain and light, mountain and rain,"
699,ROMANCE MODERNE,rain and river. Will you love me always?
700,ROMANCE MODERNE,--A car overturned and two crushed bodies
701,ROMANCE MODERNE,under it.--Always! Always!
702,ROMANCE MODERNE,And the white moon already up.
703,ROMANCE MODERNE,White. Clean. All the colors.
704,ROMANCE MODERNE,"A good head, backed by the eye--awake!"
705,ROMANCE MODERNE,backed by the emotions--blind--
706,ROMANCE MODERNE,"River and mountain, light and rain--or"
707,ROMANCE MODERNE,"rain, rock, light, trees--divided:"
708,ROMANCE MODERNE,rain-light counter rocks-trees or
709,ROMANCE MODERNE,trees counter rain-light-rocks or--
710,ROMANCE MODERNE,
711,ROMANCE MODERNE,Myriads of counter processions
712,ROMANCE MODERNE,"crossing and recrossing, regaining"
713,ROMANCE MODERNE,"the advantage, buying here, selling there"
714,ROMANCE MODERNE,--You are sold cheap everywhere in town!--
715,ROMANCE MODERNE,"lingering, touching fingers, withdrawing"
716,ROMANCE MODERNE,"gathering forces into blares, hummocks,"
717,ROMANCE MODERNE,peaks and rivers--river meeting rock
718,ROMANCE MODERNE,--I wish that you were lying there dead
719,ROMANCE MODERNE,and I sitting here beside you.--
720,ROMANCE MODERNE,It's the grey moon--over and over.
721,ROMANCE MODERNE,It's the clay of these parts.

1683,THE WIDOW'S LAMENT IN SPRINGTIME,and fall into those flowers

1692,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,Light hearted William twirled
1693,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,his November moustaches
1694,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,"and, half dressed, looked"
1695,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,from the bedroom window
1696,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,upon the spring weather.
1697,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,
1698,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,Heigh-ya! sighed he gaily
1699,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,leaning out to see
1700,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,up and down the street
1701,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,where a heavy sunlight
1702,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,lay beyond some blue shadows.
1703,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,
1704,LIGHT HEARTED WILLIAM,Into the room he drew

1715,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,The birches are mad with green points
1716,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"the wood's edge is burning with their green,"
1717,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"burning, seething--No, no, no."
1718,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,The birches are opening their leaves one
1719,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,by one. Their delicate leaves unfold cold
1720,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"and separate, one by one. Slender tassels"
1721,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,hang swaying from the delicate branch tips--
1722,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"Oh, I cannot say it. There is no word."
1723,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Black is split at once into flowers. In
1724,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"every bog and ditch, flares of"
1725,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"small fire, white flowers!--Agh,"
1726,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"the birches are mad, mad with their green."
1727,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"The world is gone, torn into shreds"
1728,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,with this blessing. What have I left undone
1729,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,that I should have undertaken
1730,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,
1731,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"O my brother, you redfaced, living man"
1732,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"ignorant, stupid whose feet are upon"
1733,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,this same dirt that I touch--and eat.
1734,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"We are alone in this terror, alone,"
1735,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"face to face on this road, you and I,"
1736,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,wrapped by this flame!
1737,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"Let the polished plows stay idle,"
1738,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,their gloss already on the black soil.
1739,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,But that face of yours--!
1740,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Answer me. I will clutch you. I
1741,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"will hug you, grip you. I will poke my face"
1742,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,into your face and force you to see me.
1743,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"Take me in your arms, tell me the commonest"
1744,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"thing that is in your mind to say,"
1745,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,say anything. I will understand you--!
1746,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,It is the madness of the birch leaves opening
1747,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"cold, one by one."
1748,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,
1749,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,My rooms will receive me. But my rooms
1750,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,are no longer sweet spaces where comfort
1751,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,is ready to wait on me with its crumbs.
1752,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,A darkness has brushed them. The mass
1753,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,of yellow tulips in the bowl is shrunken.
1754,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Every familiar object is changed and dwarfed.
1755,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"I am shaken, broken against a might"
1756,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"that splits comfort, blows apart"
1757,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"my careful partitions, crushes my house"
1758,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,and leaves me--with shrinking heart
1759,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"and startled, empty eyes--peering out"
1760,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,into a cold world.
1761,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,
1762,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,In the spring I would drink! In the spring
1763,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,I would be drunk and lie forgetting all things.
1764,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"Your face! Give me your face, Yang Kue Fei!"
1765,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"your hands, your lips to drink!"
1766,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Give me your wrists to drink--
1767,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,"I drag you, I am drowned in you, you"
1768,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,overwhelm me! Drink!
1769,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Save me! The shad bush is in the edge
1770,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,of the clearing. The yards in a fury
1771,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,of lilac blossoms are driving me mad with terror.
1772,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Drink and lie forgetting the world.
1773,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,
1774,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,And coldly the birch leaves are opening one by one.
1775,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,Coldly I observe them and wait for the end.
1776,PORTRAIT OF THE AUTHOR,And it ends.

1788,THE LONELY STREET,They have grown tall. They hold
