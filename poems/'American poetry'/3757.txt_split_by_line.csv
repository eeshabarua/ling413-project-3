93,LEGEND,
94,LEGEND,
95,LEGEND,"Long ago Apollo called to Aristaeus, youngest"
96,LEGEND,"of the shepherds,"
97,LEGEND,"Saying, ""I will make you keeper of my bees."""
98,LEGEND,"Golden were the hives, and golden was the honey;"
99,LEGEND,"golden, too, the music,"
100,LEGEND,Where the honey-makers hummed among the trees.
101,LEGEND,
102,LEGEND,"Happy Aristaeus loitered in the garden, wandered"
103,LEGEND,"in the orchard,"
104,LEGEND,"Careless and contented, indolent and free;"
105,LEGEND,"Lightly took his labour, lightly took his pleasure,"
106,LEGEND,till the fated moment
107,LEGEND,When across his pathway came Eurydice.
108,LEGEND,
109,LEGEND,Then her eyes enkindled burning love within him;
110,LEGEND,"drove him wild with longing,"
111,LEGEND,For the perfect sweetness of her flower-like face;
112,LEGEND,"Eagerly he followed, while she fled before him,"
113,LEGEND,"over mead and  mountain,"
114,LEGEND,"On through field and forest, in a breathless"
115,LEGEND,race.
116,LEGEND,
117,LEGEND,"But the nymph, in flying, trod upon a serpent;"
118,LEGEND,like a dream she vanished;
119,LEGEND,Pluto's chariot bore her down among the dead;
120,LEGEND,"Lonely Aristaeus, sadly home returning, found his"
121,LEGEND,"garden empty,"
122,LEGEND,"All the hives deserted, all the music fled."
123,LEGEND,
124,LEGEND,"Mournfully bewailing,--""ah, my honey-makers,"
125,LEGEND,"where have you departed?""--"
126,LEGEND,"Far and wide he sought them, over sea and shore;"
127,LEGEND,"Foolish is the tale that says he ever found them,"
128,LEGEND,"brought them home in triumph,--"
129,LEGEND,Joys that once escape us fly for evermore.
130,LEGEND,
131,LEGEND,"Yet I dream that somewhere, clad in downy"
132,LEGEND,"whiteness, dwell the honey-makers,"
133,LEGEND,In aerial gardens that no mortal sees:
134,LEGEND,"And at times returning, lo, they flutter round us,"
135,LEGEND,"gathering mystic harvest,--"
136,LEGEND,So I weave the legend of the long-lost bees.

140,THE SWARMING OF THE BEES,THE SWARMING OF THE BEES
141,THE SWARMING OF THE BEES,
142,I,I
143,I,
144,I,Who can tell the hiding of the white bees'
145,I,nest?
146,I,Who can trace the guiding of their swift home
147,I,flight?
148,I,Far would be his riding on a life-long quest:
149,I,Surely ere it ended would his beard grow
150,I,white.
151,I,
152,I,"Never in the coming of the rose-red Spring,"
153,I,"Never in the passing of the wine-red Fall,"
154,I,May you hear the humming of the white bee's
155,I,wing
156,I,"Murmur o'er the meadow, ere the night bells"
157,I,call.
158,I,
159,I,"Wait till winter hardens in the cold grey sky,"
160,I,Wait till leaves are fallen and the brooks all
161,I,"freeze,"
162,I,Then above the gardens where the dead flowers
163,I,"lie,"
164,I,Swarm the merry millions of the wild white
165,I,bees.
166,I,
167,II,II
168,II,
169,II,"Out of the high-built airy hive,"
170,II,"Deep in the clouds that veil the sun,"
171,II,Look how the first of the swarm arrive;
172,II,"Timidly venturing, one by one,"
173,II,"Down through the tranquil air,"
174,II,"Wavering here and there,"
175,II,"Large, and lazy in flight,--"
176,II,"Caught by a lift of the breeze,"
177,II,"Tangled among the naked trees,--"
178,II,"Dropping then, without a sound,"
179,II,"Feather-white, feather-light,"
180,II,To their rest on the ground.
181,II,
182,III,III
183,III,
184,III,Thus the swarming is begun.
185,III,"Count the leaders, every one"
186,III,Perfect as a perfect star
187,III,Till the slow descent is done.
188,III,"Look beyond them, see how far"
189,III,"Down the vistas dim and grey,"
190,III,Multitudes are on the way.
191,III,Now a sudden brightness
192,III,"Dawns within the sombre day,"
193,III,Over fields of whiteness;
194,III,And the sky is swiftly alive
195,III,With the flutter and the flight
196,III,"Of the shimmering bees, that pour"
197,III,From the hidden door of the hive
198,III,Till you can count no more.
199,III,
200,IV,IV
201,IV,
202,IV,Now on the branches of hemlock and pine
203,IV,"Thickly they settle and cluster and swing,"
204,IV,Bending them low; and the trellised vine
205,IV,And the dark elm-boughs are traced with a line
206,IV,Of beauty wherever the white bees cling.
207,IV,"Now they are hiding the wrecks of the flowers,"
208,IV,"Softly, softly, covering all,"
209,IV,Over the grave of the summer hours
210,IV,Spreading a silver pall.
211,IV,"Now they are building the broad roof ledge,"
212,IV,"Into a cornice smooth and fair,"
213,IV,"Moulding the terrace, from edge to edge,"
214,IV,Into the sweep of a marble stair.
215,IV,"Wonderful workers, swift and dumb,"
216,IV,"Numberless myriads, still they come,"
217,IV,"Thronging ever faster, faster, faster!"
218,IV,Where is their queen? Who is their master?
219,IV,"The gardens are faded, the fields are frore,--"
220,IV,How will they fare in a world so bleak?
221,IV,Where is the hidden honey they seek?
222,IV,What is the sweetness they toil to store
223,IV,"In the desolate day, where no blossoms gleam?"
224,IV,Forgetfulness and a dream!
225,IV,
226,V,V
227,V,
228,V,But now the fretful wind awakes;
229,V,I hear him girding at the trees;
230,V,"He strikes the bending boughs, and shakes"
231,V,The quiet clusters of the bees
232,V,To powdery drift;
233,V,"He tosses them away,"
234,V,He drives them like spray;
235,V,He makes them veer and shift
236,V,Around his blustering path.
237,V,"In clouds blindly whirling,"
238,V,"In rings madly swirling,"
239,V,"Full of crazy wrath,"
240,V,So furious and fast they fly
241,V,They blur the earth and blot the sky
242,V,"In wild, white mirk."
243,V,They fill the air with frozen wings
244,V,"And tiny, angry, icy stings;"
245,V,"They blind the eyes, and choke the breath,"
246,V,They dance a maddening dance of death
247,V,"Around their work,"
248,V,"Sweeping the cover from the hill,"
249,V,"Heaping the hollows deeper still,"
250,V,"Effacing every line and mark,"
251,V,"And swarming, storming in the dark"
252,V,Through the long night;
253,V,"Until, at dawn, the wind lies down,"
254,V,Weary of fight.
255,V,"The last torn cloud, with trailing gown,"
256,V,Passes the open gates of light;
257,V,And the white bees are lost in flight.
258,V,
259,VI,VI
260,VI,
261,VI,"Look how the landscape glitters wide and still,"
262,VI,Bright with a pure surprise!
263,VI,"The day begins with joy, and all past ill,"
264,VI,"Buried in white oblivion, lies"
265,VI,Beneath the snowdrifts under crystal skies.
266,VI,"New hope, new love, new life, new cheer,"
267,VI,"Flow in the sunrise beam,--"
268,VI,"The gladness of Apollo when he sees,"
269,VI,"Upon the bosom of the wintry year,"
270,VI,"The honey-harvest of his wild white bees,"
271,VI,Forgetfulness and a dream!

276,LEGEND,
277,LEGEND,"Listen, my beloved, while the silver morning,"
278,LEGEND,"like a tranquil vision,"
279,LEGEND,Fills the world around us and our hearts with
280,LEGEND,peace;
281,LEGEND,"Quiet is the close of Aristaeus' legend, happy is"
282,LEGEND,the ending--
283,LEGEND,Listen while I tell you how he found release.
284,LEGEND,
285,LEGEND,"Many months he wandered far away in sadness,"
286,LEGEND,desolately thinking
287,LEGEND,Only of the vanished joys he could not find;
288,LEGEND,"Till the great Apollo, pitying his shepherd, loosed"
289,LEGEND,him from the burden
290,LEGEND,"Of a dark, reluctant, backward-looking mind."
291,LEGEND,
292,LEGEND,Then he saw around him all the changeful beauty
293,LEGEND,"of the changing seasons,"
294,LEGEND,In the world-wide regions where his journey
295,LEGEND,lay;
296,LEGEND,"Birds that sang to cheer him, flowers that bloomed"
297,LEGEND,"beside him, stars that shone to guide him,--"
298,LEGEND,Traveller's joy was plenty all along the way!
299,LEGEND,
300,LEGEND,Everywhere he journeyed strangers made him
301,LEGEND,"welcome, listened while he taught them"
302,LEGEND,Secret lore of field and forest he had learned:
303,LEGEND,How to train the vines and make the olives fruit-
304,LEGEND,ful; how to guard the sheepfolds;
305,LEGEND,How to stay the fever when the dog-star burned.
306,LEGEND,
307,LEGEND,Friendliness and blessing followed in his foot-
308,LEGEND,"steps; richer were the harvests,"
309,LEGEND,"Happier the dwellings, wheresoe'er he came;"
310,LEGEND,"Little children loved him, and he left behind him,"
311,LEGEND,"in the hour of parting,"
312,LEGEND,Memories of kindness and a god-like name.
313,LEGEND,
314,LEGEND,"So he travelled onward, desolate no longer,"
315,LEGEND,"patient in his seeking,"
316,LEGEND,Reaping all the wayside comfort of his quest;
317,LEGEND,"Till at last in Thracia, high upon Mount Haemus,"
318,LEGEND,"far from human dwelling,"
319,LEGEND,Weary Aristaeus laid him down to rest.
320,LEGEND,
321,LEGEND,"Then the honey-makers, clad in downy whiteness,"
322,LEGEND,"fluttered soft around him,"
323,LEGEND,Wrapt him in a dreamful slumber pure and
324,LEGEND,deep.
325,LEGEND,"This is life, beloved: first a sheltered garden,"
326,LEGEND,"then a troubled journey,"
327,LEGEND,"Joy and pain of seeking,--and at last we sleep!"

333,NEW YEAR'S EVE,
334,I,I
335,I,
336,I,"The other night I had a dream, most clear"
337,I,"And comforting, complete"
338,I,"In every line, a crystal sphere,"
339,I,And full of intimate and secret cheer.
340,I,Therefore I will repeat
341,I,"That vision, dearest heart, to you,"
342,I,"As of a thing not feigned, but very true,"
343,I,"Yes, true as ever in my life befell;"
344,I,"And you, perhaps, can tell"
345,I,Whether my dream was really sad or sweet.
346,I,
347,II,II
348,II,
349,II,The shadows flecked the elm-embowered street
350,II,"I knew so well, long, long ago;"
351,II,And on the pillared porch where Marguerite
352,II,"Had sat with me, the moonlight lay like snow."
353,II,"But she, my comrade and my  friend of youth,"
354,II,"Most gaily wise,"
355,II,"Most innocently loved,--"
356,II,She of the blue-grey eyes
357,II,"That ever smiled and ever spoke the truth,--"
358,II,"From that familiar dwelling, where she moved"
359,II,"Like mirth incarnate in the years before,"
360,II,Had gone into the hidden house of Death.
361,II,I thought the garden wore
362,II,"White mourning for her blessed innocence,"
363,II,And the syringa's breath
364,II,"Came from the corner by the fence,"
365,II,"Where she had made her rustic seat,"
366,II,"With fragrance passionate, intense,"
367,II,As if it breathed a sigh for Marguerite.
368,II,My heart was heavy with a sense
369,II,Of something good forever gone. I sought
370,II,"Vainly for some consoling thought,"
371,II,Some comfortable word that I could say
372,II,"To the sad father, whom I visited again"
373,II,For the first time since she had gone away.
374,II,"The bell rang shrill and lonely,--then"
375,II,"The door was opened, and I sent my name"
376,II,"To him,--but ah! 't was Marguerite who came!"
377,II,There in the dear old dusky room she stood
378,II,"Beneath the lamp, just as she used to stand,"
379,II,In tender mocking mood.
380,II,"""You did not ask for me,"" she said,"
381,II,"""And so I will not let you take my hand;"
382,II,"""But I must hear what secret talk you planned"
383,II,"""With father. Come, my friend, be good,"
384,II,"""And tell me your affairs of state:"
385,II,"""Why you have stayed away and made me wait"
386,II,"""So long. Sit down beside me here,--"
387,II,"""And, do you know, it seemed a year"
388,II,"""Since we have talked together,--why so late?"""
389,II,
390,II,"Amazed, incredulous, confused with joy"
391,II,"I hardly dared to show,"
392,II,"And stammering like a boy,"
393,II,I took the place she showed me at her side;
394,II,And then the talk flowed on with brimming tide
395,II,"Through the still night,"
396,II,While she with influence light
397,II,"Controlled it, as the moon the flood."
398,II,"She knew where I had been, what I had done,"
399,II,"What work was planned, and what begun;"
400,II,"My troubles, failures, fears she understood,"
401,II,"And touched them with a heart so kind,"
402,II,"That every care was melted from my mind,"
403,II,"And every hope grew bright,"
404,II,And life seemed moving on to happy ends.
405,II,"(Ah, what self-beggared fool was he"
406,II,That said a woman cannot be
407,II,The very best of friends?)
408,II,"Then there were memories of old times,"
409,II,Recalled with many a gentle jest;
410,II,And at the last she brought the book of rhymes
411,II,"We made together, trying to translate"
412,II,The Songs of Heine (hers were always best).
413,II,"""Now come,"" she said,"
414,II,"""To-night we will collaborate"
415,II,"""Again; I'll put you to the test."
416,II,"""Here's one I never found the way to do,--"
417,II,"""The simplest are the hardest ones, you know,--"
418,II,"""I give this song to you."""
419,II,And then she read:
420,II,"Mein kind, wir waren Kinder,"
421,II,"Zwei Kinder, jung und froh."
422,II,
423,II,But all the while a silent question stirred
424,II,"Within me, though I dared not speak the word:"
425,II,"""Is it herself, and is she truly here,"
426,II,"""And was I dreaming when I heard"
427,II,"""That she was dead last year?"
428,II,"""Or was it true, and is she but a shade"
429,II,"""Who brings a fleeting joy to eye and ear,"
430,II,"""Cold though so kind, and will she gently fade"
431,II,"""When her sweet ghostly part is played"
432,II,"""And the light-curtain falls at dawn of day?"""
433,II,But while my heart was troubled by this fear
434,II,"So deeply that I could not speak it out,"
435,II,"Lest all my happiness should disappear,"
436,II,I thought me of a cunning way
437,II,To hide the question and dissolve the doubt.
438,II,"""Will you not give me now your hand,"
439,II,"""Dear Marguerite,"" I asked, ""to touch and hold,"
440,II,"""That by this token I may understand"
441,II,"""You are the same true friend you were of old?"""
442,II,She answered with a smile so bright and calm
443,II,It seemed as if I saw new stars arise
444,II,In the deep heaven of her eyes;
445,II,"And smiling so, she laid her palm"
446,II,"In mine. Dear God, it was not cold"
447,II,But warm with vital heat!
448,II,"""You live!"" I cried, ""you live, dear Marguerite!"""
449,II,"Then I awoke; but strangely comforted,"
450,II,Although I knew again that she was dead.
451,II,
452,III,III
453,III,
454,III,"Yes, there's the dream! And was it sweet or"
455,III,sad?
456,III,"Dear mistress of my waking and my sleep,"
457,III,"Present reward of all my heart's desire,"
458,III,"Watching with me beside the winter fire,"
459,III,Interpret now this vision that I had.
460,III,"But while you read the meaning, let me keep"
461,III,The touch of you: for the Old Year with storm
462,III,"Is passing through the midnight, and doth shake"
463,III,"The corners of the house,--and oh! my heart"
464,III,would break
465,III,Unless both dreaming and awake
466,III,"My hand could feel your hand was warm, warm,"
467,III,warm!

1219,I,"Of maple-buds along the misty hills,"
1220,I,And that immortal call which fills

1222,I,"The snow-drops came so long ago,"
1223,I,It seemed that Spring was near!
1224,I,But then returned the snow
1225,I,"With biting winds, and all the earth grew sere,"
1226,I,And sullen clouds drooped low

1239,I,The woods were bare: and every night the frost
1240,I,"To all my longings spoke a silent nay,"

1431,I,"A hundred times, but always far away!"
1432,I,"Ah, well do I remember how it seemed,"
1433,I,Through the still atmosphere
1434,I,"Of that enchanted day,"
1435,I,To lie wide open to my weary feet:
1436,I,"A little land of love and joy and rest,"
1437,I,"With meadows of soft green,"
1438,I,"Rosy with cyclamen, and sweet"
1439,I,"With delicate breath of violets unseen,--"
1440,I,"And, tranquil 'mid the bloom"
1441,I,"As if it waited for a coming guest,"
1442,I,A little house of peace and joy and love
1443,I,Was nested like a snow-white dove
1444,I,
1445,I,"From the rough mountain where I stood,"
1446,I,"Homesick for happiness,"
1447,I,Only a narrow valley and a darkling wood
1448,I,"To cross, and then the long distress"
1449,I,"Of solitude would be forever past,--"
1450,I,I should be home at last.
1451,I,"But not too soon! oh, let me linger here"
1452,I,"And feed my eyes, hungry with sorrow,"
1453,I,"On all this loveliness, so near,"
1454,I,And mine to-morrow!
1455,I,
1456,I,"Then, from the wood, across the silvery blue,"
1457,I,"A dark bird flew,"
1458,I,"Silent, with sable wings."
1459,I,"Close in his wake another came,--"
1460,I,Fragments of midnight floating through
1461,I,"The sunset flame,--"
1462,I,"Another and another, weaving rings"
1463,I,"Of blackness on the primrose sky,--"
1464,I,"Another, and another, look, a score,"
1465,I,"A hundred, yes, a thousand rising heavily"
1466,I,"From that accursed, dumb, and ancient wood,--"
1467,I,They boiled into the lucid air
1468,I,Like smoke from some deep caldron of despair!
1469,I,"And more, and more, and ever more,"
1470,I,"The numberless, ill-omened brood,"
1471,I,"Flapping their ragged plumes,"
1472,I,Possessed the landscape and the evening light
1473,I,With menaces and glooms.
1474,I,"Oh, dark, dark, dark they hovered o'er the place"
1475,I,Where once I saw the little house so white
1476,I,"Amid the flowers, covering every trace"
1477,I,"Of beauty from my troubled sight,--"
1478,I,And suddenly it was night!
1479,I,

1481,II,
1482,II,At break of day I crossed the wooded vale;
1483,II,And while the morning made
1484,II,"A trembling light among the tree-tops pale,"
1485,II,"I saw the sable birds on every limb,"
1486,II,"Clinging together closely in the shade,"
1487,II,And croaking placidly their surly hymn.
1488,II,"But, oh, the little land of peace and love"
1489,II,That those night-loving wings had poised
1490,II,"above,--"
1491,II,Where was it gone?
1492,II,"Lost, lost forevermore!"
1493,II,"Only a cottage, dull and gray,"
1494,II,"In the cold light of dawn,"
1495,II,With iron bars across the door:
1496,II,Only a garden where the withering heads
1497,II,"Of flowers, presaging decay,"
1498,II,Hung over barren beds:
1499,II,Only a desolate field that lay
1500,II,"Untilled beneath the desolate day,--"
1501,II,Where Eden seemed to bloom I found but these!
1502,II,"So, wondering, I passed along my way,"
1503,II,"With anger in my heart, too deep for words,"
1504,II,"Against that grove of evil-sheltering trees,"
1505,II,And the black magic of the croaking birds.

2090,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Ten days we voyaged through that placid land,"

2111,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,And all the promised land begins to flow
2112,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,With milk and honey. Stately manors rise
2113,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Along the banks, and castles top the hills,"
2114,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"And little villages grow populous with trade,"
2115,THE SHALLOP ON HUDSON BAY,"Until the river runs as proudly as the Rhine,--"
