38,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
39,PREFACE.,
40,PREFACE.,The intellectual activity of Emily Dickinson was so great that a
41,PREFACE.,large and characteristic choice is still possible among her
42,PREFACE.,"literary material, and this third volume of her verses is put"
43,PREFACE.,forth in response to the repeated wish of the admirers of her
44,PREFACE.,"peculiar genius. Much of Emily Dickinson's prose was rhythmic,"
45,PREFACE.,"--even rhymed, though frequently not set apart in lines."
46,PREFACE.,
47,PREFACE.,"Also many verses, written as such, were sent to friends in"
48,PREFACE.,"letters; these were published in 1894, in the volumes of her"
49,PREFACE.,"_Letters_. It has not been necessary, however, to include them in"
50,PREFACE.,"this Series, and all have been omitted, except three or four"
51,PREFACE.,"exceptionally strong ones, as ""A Book,"" and ""With Flowers."""
52,PREFACE.,
53,PREFACE.,There is internal evidence that many of the poems were simply
54,PREFACE.,"spontaneous flashes of insight, apparently unrelated to outward"
55,PREFACE.,"circumstance. Others, however, had an obvious personal origin;"
56,PREFACE.,"for example, the verses ""I had a Guinea golden,"" which seem to"
57,PREFACE.,"have been sent to some friend travelling in Europe, as a dainty"
58,PREFACE.,reminder of letter-writing delinquencies. The surroundings in
59,PREFACE.,which any of Emily Dickinson's verses are known to have been
60,PREFACE.,written usually serve to explain them clearly; but in general the
61,PREFACE.,present volume is full of thoughts needing no interpretation to
62,PREFACE.,those who apprehend this scintillating spirit.
