65,AT MY FIRESIDE,
66,AT MY FIRESIDE,"ALONE, beneath the darkened sky,"
67,AT MY FIRESIDE,"With saddened heart and unstrung lyre,"
68,AT MY FIRESIDE,"I heap the spoils of years gone by,"
69,AT MY FIRESIDE,"And leave them with a long-drawn sigh,"
70,AT MY FIRESIDE,"Like drift-wood brands that glimmering lie,"
71,AT MY FIRESIDE,Before the ashes hide the fire.
72,AT MY FIRESIDE,
73,AT MY FIRESIDE,Let not these slow declining days
74,AT MY FIRESIDE,The rosy light of dawn outlast;
75,AT MY FIRESIDE,"Still round my lonely hearth it plays,"
76,AT MY FIRESIDE,"And gilds the east with borrowed rays,"
77,AT MY FIRESIDE,While memory's mirrored sunset blaze
78,AT MY FIRESIDE,Flames on the windows of the past.

86,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB
87,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,THIS is our place of meeting; opposite
88,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,That towered and pillared building: look at it;
89,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"King's Chapel in the Second George's day,"
90,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Rebellion stole its regal name away,--"
91,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Stone Chapel sounded better; but at last
92,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The poisoned name of our provincial past
93,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Had lost its ancient venom; then once more
94,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Stone Chapel was King's Chapel as before.
95,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"(So let rechristened North Street, when it can,"
96,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Bring back the days of Marlborough and Queen Anne!)
97,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Next the old church your wandering eye will meet--
98,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,A granite pile that stares upon the street--
99,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Our civic temple; slanderous tongues have said
100,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Its shape was modelled from St. Botolph's head,"
101,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Lofty, but narrow; jealous passers-by"
102,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Say Boston always held her head too high.
103,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Turn half-way round, and let your look survey"
104,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The white facade that gleams across the way,--"
105,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The many-windowed building, tall and wide,"
106,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The palace-inn that shows its northern side
107,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,In grateful shadow when the sunbeams beat
108,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The granite wall in summer's scorching heat.
109,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,This is the place; whether its name you spell
110,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Tavern, or caravansera, or hotel."
111,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Would I could steal its echoes! you should find
112,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such store of vanished pleasures brought to mind
113,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such feasts! the laughs of many a jocund hour
114,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,That shook the mortar from King George's tower;
115,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Such guests! What famous names its record boasts,"
116,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Whose owners wander in the mob of ghosts!
117,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such stories! Every beam and plank is filled
118,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"With juicy wit the joyous talkers spilled,"
119,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Ready to ooze, as once the mountain pine"
120,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The floors are laid with oozed its turpentine!
121,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
122,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,A month had flitted since The Club had met;
123,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The day came round; I found the table set,"
124,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The waiters lounging round the marble stairs,"
125,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Empty as yet the double row of chairs.
126,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"I was a full half hour before the rest,"
127,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Alone, the banquet-chamber's single guest."
128,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"So from the table's side a chair I took,"
129,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And having neither company nor book
130,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"To keep me waking, by degrees there crept"
131,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"A torpor over me,--in short, I slept."
132,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
133,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Loosed from its chain, along the wreck-strown track"
134,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of the dead years my soul goes travelling back;
135,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,My ghosts take on their robes of flesh; it seems
136,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Dreaming is life; nay, life less life than dreams,"
137,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,So real are the shapes that meet my eyes.
138,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"They bring no sense of wonder, no surprise,"
139,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,No hint of other than an earth-born source;
140,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"All seems plain daylight, everything of course."
141,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
142,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"How dim the colors are, how poor and faint"
143,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,This palette of weak words with which I paint!
144,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Here sit my friends; if I could fix them so
145,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"As to my eyes they seem, my page would glow"
146,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Like a queen's missal, warm as if the brush"
147,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of Titian or Velasquez brought the flush
148,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of life into their features. Ay de mi!
149,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"If syllables were pigments, you should see"
150,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Such breathing portraitures as never man
151,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Found in the Pitti or the Vatican.
152,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
153,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Here sits our POET, Laureate, if you will."
154,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Long has he worn the wreath, and wears it still."
155,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Dead? Nay, not so; and yet they say his bust"
156,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Looks down on marbles covering royal dust,"
157,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Kings by the Grace of God, or Nature's grace;"
158,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Dead! No! Alive! I see him in his place,"
159,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Full-featured, with the bloom that heaven denies"
160,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Her children, pinched by cold New England skies,"
161,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Too often, while the nursery's happier few"
162,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Win from a summer cloud its roseate hue.
163,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Kind, soft-voiced, gentle, in his eye there shines"
164,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The ray serene that filled Evangeline's.
165,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Modest he seems, not shy; content to wait"
166,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Amid the noisy clamor of debate
167,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The looked-for moment when a peaceful word
168,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Smooths the rough ripples louder tongues have stirred.
169,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,In every tone I mark his tender grace
170,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And all his poems hinted in his face;
171,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,What tranquil joy his friendly presence gives!
172,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,How could. I think him dead? He lives! He lives!
173,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
174,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"There, at the table's further end I see"
175,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In his old place our Poet's vis-a-vis,"
176,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The great PROFESSOR, strong, broad-shouldered, square,"
177,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In life's rich noontide, joyous, debonair."
178,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"His social hour no leaden care alloys,"
179,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"His laugh rings loud and mirthful as a boy's,--"
180,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"That lusty laugh the Puritan forgot,--"
181,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,What ear has heard it and remembers not?
182,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"How often, halting at some wide crevasse"
183,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Amid the windings of his Alpine pass,"
184,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"High up the cliffs, the climbing mountaineer,"
185,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Listening the far-off avalanche to hear,"
186,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Silent, and leaning on his steel-shod staff,"
187,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Has heard that cheery voice, that ringing laugh,"
188,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,From the rude cabin whose nomadic walls
189,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Creep with the moving glacier as it crawls
190,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,How does vast Nature lead her living train
191,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In ordered sequence through that spacious brain,"
192,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,As in the primal hour when Adam named
193,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The new-born tribes that young creation claimed!--
194,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"How will her realm be darkened, losing thee,"
195,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Her darling, whom we call _our_ AGASSIZ!"
196,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
197,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,But who is he whose massive frame belies
198,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,The maiden shyness of his downcast eyes?
199,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Who broods in silence till, by questions pressed,"
200,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Some answer struggles from his laboring breast?
201,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"An artist Nature meant to dwell apart,"
202,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Locked in his studio with a human heart,"
203,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Tracking its eaverned passions to their lair,"
204,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And all its throbbing mysteries laying bare.
205,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Count it no marvel that he broods alone
206,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Over the heart he studies,--'t is his own;"
207,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"So in his page, whatever shape it wear,"
208,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The Essex wizard's shadowed self is there,--"
209,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The great ROMANCER, hid beneath his veil"
210,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Like the stern preacher of his sombre tale;
211,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Virile in strength, yet bashful as a girl,"
212,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Prouder than Hester, sensitive as Pearl."
213,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
214,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"From his mild throng of worshippers released,"
215,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Our Concord Delphi sends its chosen priest,"
216,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Prophet or poet, mystic, sage, or seer,"
217,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,By every title always welcome here.
218,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Why that ethereal spirit's frame describe?
219,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"You know the race-marks of the Brahmin tribe,"
220,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The spare, slight form, the sloping shoulders' droop,"
221,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The calm, scholastic mien, the clerkly stoop,"
222,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The lines of thought the sharpened features wear,"
223,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Carved by the edge of keen New England air.
224,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,List! for he speaks! As when a king would choose
225,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The jewels for his bride, he might refuse"
226,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"This diamond for its flaw,--find that less bright"
227,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Than those, its fellows, and a pearl less white"
228,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Than fits her snowy neck, and yet at last,"
229,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"The fairest gems are chosen, and made fast"
230,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In golden fetters; so, with light delays"
231,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,He seeks the fittest word to fill his phrase;
232,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Nor vain nor idle his fastidious quest,"
233,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,His chosen word is sure to prove the best.
234,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Where in the realm of thought, whose air is song,"
235,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Does he, the Buddha of the West, belong?"
236,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"He seems a winged Franklin, sweetly wise,"
237,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Born to unlock the secrets of the skies;
238,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"And which the nobler calling,--if 't is fair"
239,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Terrestrial with celestial to compare,--"
240,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"To guide the storm-cloud's elemental flame,"
241,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Or walk the chambers whence the lightning came,"
242,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Amidst the sources of its subtile fire,"
243,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And steal their effluence for his lips and lyre?
244,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"If lost at times in vague aerial flights,"
245,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,None treads with firmer footstep when he lights;
246,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"A soaring nature, ballasted with sense,"
247,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Wisdom without her wrinkles or pretence,"
248,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In every Bible he has faith to read,"
249,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And every altar helps to shape his creed.
250,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Ask you what name this prisoned spirit bears
251,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,While with ourselves this fleeting breath it shares?
252,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Till angels greet him with a sweeter one
253,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"In heaven, on earth we call him EMERSON."
254,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,
255,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,I start; I wake; the vision is withdrawn;
256,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Its figures fading like the stars at dawn;
257,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,"Crossed from the roll of life their cherished names,"
258,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,And memory's pictures fading in their frames;
259,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Yet life is lovelier for these transient gleams
260,AT THE SATURDAY CLUB,Of buried friendships; blest is he who dreams!

273,H. W. L.,"Ours was thy birthplace, but in every zone"
274,H. W. L.,Some wreath of song thy liberal hand has thrown
275,H. W. L.,"Breathes perfume from its blossoms, that entwine"
276,H. W. L.,"Where'er the dewdrops fall, the sunbeams shine,"
277,H. W. L.,On life's long path with tangled cares o'ergrown.
278,H. W. L.,"Can Art thy truthful counterfeit command,--"
279,H. W. L.,"The silver-haloed features, tranquil, mild,--"
280,H. W. L.,"Soften the lips of bronze as when they smiled,"
281,H. W. L.,Give warmth and pressure to the marble hand?

284,H. W. L.,
285,H. W. L.,"Carved from the block or cast in clinging mould,"

293,H. W. L.,"How Nature loved him! On his placid brow,"
294,H. W. L.,"Thought's ample dome, she set the sacred sign"
295,H. W. L.,"That marks the priesthood of her holiest shrine,"

298,H. W. L.,To prove her chosen minstrel's song divine.
299,H. W. L.,
300,H. W. L.,On many a saddened hearth the evening fire
301,H. W. L.,"Burns paler as the children's hour draws near,--"
302,H. W. L.,"That joyous hour his song made doubly dear,--"
303,H. W. L.,And tender memories touch the faltering choir.
304,H. W. L.,He sings no more on earth; our vain desire
305,H. W. L.,Aches for the voice we loved so long to hear
306,H. W. L.,"In Dorian flute-notes breathing soft and clear,--"

312,H. W. L.,The shadowy silence hears us call in vain!
313,H. W. L.,His lips are hushed; his song shall never die.

746,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Our eyes still meet amid the haunts of men;
747,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Scarce one of all the living gathered there,"
748,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whose unthinned locks betrayed a silver hair,"
749,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Greets us to-day, and yet we seem the same"
750,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As our own sires and grandsires, save in name."
751,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"There are the patriarchs, looking vaguely round"
752,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"For classmates' faces, hardly known if found;"
753,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,See the cold brow that rules the busy mart;
754,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Close at its side the pallid son of art,"
755,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whose purchased skill with borrowed meaning clothes,"
756,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And stolen hues, the smirking face he loathes."
757,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Here is the patient scholar; in his looks
758,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,You read the titles of his learned books;
759,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What classic lore those spidery crow's-feet speak!
760,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What problems figure on that wrinkled cheek!
761,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"For never thought but left its stiffened trace,"
762,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Its fossil footprint, on the plastic face,"
763,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As the swift record of a raindrop stands,"
764,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Fixed on the tablet of the hardening sands.
765,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,On every face as on the written page
766,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Each year renews the autograph of age;
767,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"One trait alone may wasting years defy,--"
768,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The fire still lingering in the poet's eye,"
769,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While Hope, the siren, sings her sweetest strain,--"
770,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,_Non omnis moriar_ is its proud refrain.
771,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
772,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Sadly we gaze upon the vacant chair;
773,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"He who should claim its honors is not there,--"
774,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Otis, whose lips the listening crowd enthrall"
775,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That press and pack the floor of Boston's hall.
776,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But Kirkland smiles, released from toil and care"
777,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Since the silk mantle younger shoulders wear,--"
778,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Quincy's, whose spirit breathes the selfsame fire"
779,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"That filled the bosom of his youthful sire,"
780,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Who for the altar bore the kindled torch
781,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"To freedom's temple, dying in its porch."
782,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
783,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Three grave professions in their sons appear,"
784,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Whose words well studied all well pleased will hear
785,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Palfrey, ordained in varied walks to shine,"
786,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Statesman, historian, critic, and divine;"
787,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Solid and square behold majestic Shaw,"
788,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A mass of wisdom and a mine of law;
789,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Warren, whose arm the doughtiest warriors fear,"
790,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Asks of the startled crowd to lend its ear,--"
791,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Proud of his calling, him the world loves best,"
792,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Not as the coming, but the parting guest."
793,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
794,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Look on that form,--with eye dilating scan"
795,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The stately mould of nature's kingliest man!
796,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Tower-like he stands in life's unfaded prime;
797,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Ask you his name? None asks a second time
798,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"He from the land his outward semblance takes,"
799,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where storm-swept mountains watch o'er slumbering lakes.
800,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,See in the impress which the body wears
801,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,How its imperial might the soul declares
802,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The forehead's large expansion, lofty, wide,"
803,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That locks unsilvered vainly strive to hide;
804,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The lines of thought that plough the sober cheek;
805,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Lips that betray their wisdom ere they speak
806,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In tones like answers from Dodona's grove;
807,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,An eye like Juno's when she frowns on Jove.
808,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,I look and wonder; will he be content--
809,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"This man, this monarch, for the purple meant--"
810,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The meaner duties of his tribe to share,"
811,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Clad in the garb that common mortals wear?
812,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Ah, wild Ambition, spread thy restless wings,"
813,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Beneath whose plumes the hidden cestrum stings;
814,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
815,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thou whose bold flight would leave earth's vulgar crowds,"
816,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And like the eagle soar above the clouds,"
817,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Must feel the pang that fallen angels know
818,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When the red lightning strikes thee from below!
819,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
820,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Less bronze, more silver, mingles in the mould"
821,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of him whom next my roving eyes behold;
822,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"His, more the scholar's than the statesman's face,"
823,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Proclaims him born of academic race.
824,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Weary his look, as if an aching brain"
825,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Left on his brow the frozen prints of pain;
826,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"His voice far-reaching, grave, sonorous, owns"
827,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"A shade of sadness in its plaintive tones,"
828,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Yet when its breath some loftier thought inspires
829,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Glows with a heat that every bosom fires.
830,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Such Everett seems; no chance-sown wild flower knows
831,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The full-blown charms of culture's double rose,--"
832,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Alas, how soon, by death's unsparing frost,"
833,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Its bloom is faded and its fragrance lost!
834,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
835,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Two voices, only two, to earth belong,"
836,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of all whose accents met the listening throng:
837,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Winthrop, alike for speech and guidance framed,"
838,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,On that proud day a twofold duty claimed;
839,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"One other yet,--remembered or forgot,--"
840,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Forgive my silence if I name him not.
841,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Can I believe it? I, whose youthful voice"
842,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Claimed a brief gamut,--notes not over choice,"
843,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Stood undismayed before the solemn throng,"
844,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And _propria voce_ sung that saucy song
845,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Which even in memory turns my soul aghast,--"
846,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,_Felix audacia_ was the verdict cast.
847,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
848,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What were the glory of these festal days
849,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Shorn of their grand illumination's blaze?
850,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Night comes at last with all her starry train
851,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,To find a light in every glittering pane.
852,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"From ""Harvard's"" windows see the sudden flash,--"
853,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Old ""Massachusetts"" glares through every sash;"
854,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From wall to wall the kindling splendors run
855,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Till all is glorious as the noonday sun.
856,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
857,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,How to the scholar's mind each object brings
858,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"What some historian tells, some poet sings!"
859,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The good gray teacher whom we all revered--
860,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Loved, honored, laughed at, and by freshmen feared,"
861,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As from old ""Harvard,"" where its light began,"
862,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From hall to hall the clustering splendors ran--
863,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Took down his well-worn Eschylus and read,"
864,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Lit by the rays a thousand tapers shed,"
865,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,How the swift herald crossed the leagues between
866,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Mycenae's monarch and his faithless queen;
867,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And thus he read,--my verse but ill displays"
868,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The Attic picture, clad in modern phrase."
869,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
870,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"On Ida's summit flames the kindling pile,"
871,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And Lemnos answers from his rocky isle;
872,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"From Athos next it climbs the reddening skies,"
873,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thence where the watch-towers of Macistus rise.
874,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The sentries of Mesapius in their turn
875,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Bid the dry heath in high piled masses burn,"
876,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Cithoeron's crag the crimson billows stain,"
877,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Far AEgiplanctus joins the fiery train.
878,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thus the swift courier through the pathless night
879,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Has gained at length the Arachnoean height,"
880,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whence the glad tidings, borne on wings offlame,"
881,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"""Ilium has fallen!"" reach the royal dame."
882,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
883,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So ends the day; before the midnight stroke
884,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The lights expiring cloud the air with smoke;
885,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While these the toil of younger hands employ,"
886,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The slumbering Grecian dreams of smouldering Troy.
887,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
888,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As to that hour with backward steps I turn,"
889,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Midway I pause; behold a funeral urn!
890,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Ah, sad memorial! known but all too well"
891,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The tale which thus its golden letters tell:
892,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
893,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"This dust, once breathing, changed its joyous life"
894,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"For toil and hunger, wounds and mortal strife;"
895,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Love, friendship, learning's all prevailing charms,"
896,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,For the cold bivouac and the clash of arms.
897,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The cause of freedom won, a race enslaved"
898,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Called back to manhood, and a nation saved,"
899,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These sons of Harvard, falling ere their prime,"
900,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Leave their proud memory to the coming time.
901,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
902,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While in their still retreats our scholars turn
903,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The mildewed pages of the past, to learn"
904,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,With endless labor of the sleepless brain
905,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"What once has been and ne'er shall be again,"
906,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,We reap the harvest of their ceaseless toil
907,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And find a fragrance in their midnight oil.
908,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,But let a purblind mortal dare the task
909,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The embryo future of itself to ask,"
910,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The world reminds him, with a scornful laugh,"
911,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That times have changed since Prospero broke his staff.
912,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Could all the wisdom of the schools foretell
913,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The dismal hour when Lisbon shook and fell,"
914,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Or name the shuddering night that toppled down
915,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Our sister's pride, beneath whose mural crown"
916,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Scarce had the scowl forgot its angry lines,"
917,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When earth's blind prisoners fired their fatal mines?
918,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
919,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"New realms, new worlds, exulting Science claims,"
920,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Still the dim future unexplored remains;
921,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Her trembling scales the far-off planet weigh,"
922,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Her torturing prisms its elements betray,--"
923,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We know what ores the fires of Sirius melt,"
924,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What vaporous metals gild Orion's belt;
925,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Angels, archangels, may have yet to learn"
926,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Those hidden truths our heaven-taught eyes discern;
927,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Yet vain is Knowledge, with her mystic wand,"
928,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,To pierce the cloudy screen and read beyond;
929,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Once to the silent stars the fates were known,"
930,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,To us they tell no secrets but their own.
931,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
932,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"At Israel's altar still we humbly bow,"
933,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But where, oh where, are Israel's prophets now?"
934,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where is the sibyl with her hoarded leaves?
935,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where is the charm the weird enchantress weaves?
936,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"No croaking raven turns the auspex pale,"
937,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,No reeking altars tell the morrow's tale;
938,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The measured footsteps of the Fates are dumb,"
939,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Unseen, unheard, unheralded, they come,"
940,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Prophet and priest and all their following fail.
941,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Who then is left to rend the future's veil?
942,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Who but the poet, he whose nicer sense"
943,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"No film can baffle with its slight defence,"
944,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whose finer vision marks the waves that stray,"
945,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Felt, but unseen, beyond the violet ray?--"
946,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Who, while the storm-wind waits its darkening shroud,"
947,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Foretells the tempest ere he sees the cloud,--"
948,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Stays not for time his secrets to reveal,"
949,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,But reads his message ere he breaks the seal.
950,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So Mantua's bard foretold the coming day
951,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Ere Bethlehem's infant in the manger lay;
952,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The promise trusted to a mortal tongue
953,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Found listening ears before the angels sung.
954,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"So while his load the creeping pack-horse galled,"
955,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While inch by inch the dull canal-boat crawled,"
956,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Darwin beheld a Titan from ""afar"
957,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car,"""
958,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"That panting giant fed by air and flame,"
959,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The mightiest forges task their strength to tame.
960,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
961,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Happy the poet! him no tyrant fact
962,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Holds in its clutches to be chained and racked;
963,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Him shall no mouldy document convict,"
964,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,No stern statistics gravely contradict;
965,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,No rival sceptre threats his airy throne;
966,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"He rules o'er shadows, but he reigns alone."
967,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Shall I the poet's broad dominion claim
968,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Because you bid me wear his sacred name
969,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,For these few moments? Shall I boldly clash
970,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"My flint and steel, and by the sudden flash"
971,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Read the fair vision which my soul descries
972,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Through the wide pupils of its wondering eyes?
973,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,List then awhile; the fifty years have sped;
974,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The third full century's opened scroll is spread,"
975,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Blank to all eyes save his who dimly sees
976,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The shadowy future told in words like these.
977,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
978,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"How strange the prospect to my sight appears,"
979,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Changed by the busy hands of fifty years!
980,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Full well I know our ocean-salted Charles,"
981,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Filling and emptying through the sands and marls
982,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"That wall his restless stream on either bank,"
983,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all unlovely when the sedges rank
984,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Lend their coarse veil the sable ooze to hide
985,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That bares its blackness with the ebbing tide.
986,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In other shapes to my illumined eyes
987,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Those ragged margins of our stream arise
988,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Through walls of stone the sparkling waters flow,"
989,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"In clearer depths the golden sunsets glow,"
990,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"On purer waves the lamps of midnight gleam,"
991,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That silver o'er the unpolluted stream.
992,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Along his shores what stately temples rise,"
993,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"What spires, what turrets, print the shadowed skies!"
994,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Our smiling Mother sees her broad domain
995,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Spread its tall roofs along the western plain;
996,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Those blazoned windows' blushing glories tell
997,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of grateful hearts that loved her long and well;
998,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Yon gilded dome that glitters in the sun
999,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Was Dives' gift,--alas, his only one!"
1000,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These buttressed walls enshrine a banker's name,"
1001,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That hallowed chapel hides a miser's shame;
1002,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Their wealth they left,--their memory cannot fade"
1003,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Though age shall crumble every stone they laid.
1004,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1005,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Great lord of millions,--let me call thee great,"
1006,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Since countless servants at thy bidding wait,--"
1007,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Richesse oblige: no mortal must be blind
1008,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"To all but self, or look at human kind"
1009,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Laboring and suffering,--all its want and woe,--"
1010,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Through sheets of crystal, as a pleasing show"
1011,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That makes life happier for the chosen few
1012,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Duty for whom is something not to do.
1013,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"When thy last page of life at length is filled,"
1014,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,What shall thine heirs to keep thy memory build?
1015,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Will piles of stone in Auburn's mournful shade
1016,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Save from neglect the spot where thou art laid?
1017,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nay, deem not thus; the sauntering stranger's eye"
1018,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Will pass unmoved thy columned tombstone by,"
1019,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"No memory wakened, not a teardrop shed,"
1020,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thy name uncared for and thy date unread.
1021,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But if thy record thou indeed dost prize,"
1022,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Bid from the soil some stately temple rise,--"
1023,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Some hall of learning, some memorial shrine,"
1024,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,With names long honored to associate thine:
1025,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So shall thy fame outlive thy shattered bust
1026,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When all around thee slumber in the dust.
1027,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thus England's Henry lives in Eton's towers,"
1028,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Saved from the spoil oblivion's gulf devours;
1029,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Our later records with as fair a fame
1030,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Have wreathed each uncrowned benefactor's name;
1031,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The walls they reared the memories still retain
1032,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That churchyard marbles try to keep in vain.
1033,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In vain the delving antiquary tries
1034,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,To find the tomb where generous Harvard lies
1035,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Here, here, his lasting monument is found,"
1036,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where every spot is consecrated ground!
1037,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"O'er Stoughton's dust the crumbling stone decays,"
1038,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Fast fade its lines of lapidary praise;
1039,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"There the wild bramble weaves its ragged nets,"
1040,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,There the dry lichen spreads its gray rosettes;
1041,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Still in yon walls his memory lives unspent,"
1042,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nor asks a braver, nobler monument."
1043,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thus Hollis lives, and Holden, honored, praised,"
1044,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And good Sir Matthew, in the halls they raised;"
1045,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thus live the worthies of these later times,"
1046,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Who shine in deeds, less brilliant, grouped in rhymes."
1047,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Say, shall the Muse with faltering steps retreat,"
1048,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Or dare these names in rhythmic form repeat?
1049,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Why not as boldly as from Homer's lips
1050,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The long array, of Argive battle-ships?"
1051,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When o'er our graves a thousand years have past
1052,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,(If to such date our threatened globe shall last)
1053,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These classic precincts, myriad feet have pressed,"
1054,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Will show on high, in beauteous garlands dressed,"
1055,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Those honored names that grace our later day,--"
1056,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Weld, Matthews, Sever, Thayer, Austin, Gray,"
1057,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Sears, Phillips, Lawrence, Hemenway,--to the list"
1058,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Add Sanders, Sibley,--all the Muse has missed."
1059,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1060,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Once more I turn to read the pictured page
1061,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Bright with the promise of the coming age.
1062,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Ye unborn sons of children yet unborn,"
1063,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whose youthful eyes shall greet that far-off morn,"
1064,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Blest are those eyes that all undimmed behold
1065,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The sights so longed for by the wise of old.
1066,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"From high-arched alcoves, through resounding halls,"
1067,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Clad in full robes majestic Science calls,"
1068,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Tireless, unsleeping, still at Nature's feet,"
1069,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Whate'er she utters fearless to repeat,"
1070,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Her lips at last from every cramp released
1071,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,That Israel's prophet caught from Egypt's priest.
1072,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"I see the statesman, firm, sagacious, bold,"

1080,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,These four brief lines addressed to youth inclined

1082,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1083,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Who writes in verse that should have writ in prose
1084,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Is like a traveller walking on his toes;
1085,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Happy the rhymester who in time has found
1086,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The heels he lifts were made to touch the ground.
1087,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1088,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"I see gray teachers,--on their work intent,"

1094,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Ah, many a year will pass, I thought, ere we"

1100,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And while the symbols of his tribe I seek
1101,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thus my first impulse bids me think and speak:
1102,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1103,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Let not the mitre England's prelate wears
1104,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Next to the crown whose regal pomp it shares,"
1105,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Though low before it courtly Christians bow,"
1106,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Leave its red mark on Younger England's brow.
1107,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We love, we honor, the maternal dame,"
1108,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"But let her priesthood wear a modest name,"
1109,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While through the waters of the Pilgrim's bay
1110,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A new-born Mayflower shows her keels the way.
1111,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Too old grew Britain for her mother's beads,--"
1112,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Must we be necklaced with her children's creeds?
1113,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Welcome alike in surplice or in gown
1114,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The loyal lieges of the Heavenly Crown!
1115,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We greet with cheerful, not submissive, mien"
1116,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"A sister church, but not a mitred Queen!"
1117,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,

1126,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Still, as of old, forever bright and clear,"

1128,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And wondrous virtue, simple folk aver,"

1130,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1131,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Of old I wandered by the river's side
1132,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Between whose banks the mighty waters glide,"

1134,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Builds and unbuilds its ever-tumbling wall;
1135,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Oft in my dreams I hear the rush and roar
1136,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Of battling floods, and feel the trembling shore,"
1137,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As the huge torrent, girded for its leap,"
1138,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,With bellowing thunders plunges down the steep.
1139,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Not less distinct, from memory's pictured urn,"
1140,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The gray old rock, the leafy woods, return;"
1141,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Robed in their pride the lofty oaks appear,"
1142,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And once again with quickened sense I hear,"
1143,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Through the low murmur of the leaves that stir,"
1144,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The tinkling teardrop of _la roche qui pleure_.
1145,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1146,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"So when the third ripe century stands complete,"
1147,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"As once again the sons of Harvard meet,"
1148,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Rejoicing, numerous as the seashore sands,"
1149,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Drawn from all quarters,--farthest distant lands,"
1150,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where through the reeds the scaly saurian steals,"
1151,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where cold Alaska feeds her floundering seals,"
1152,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where Plymouth, glorying, wears her iron crown,"
1153,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where Sacramento sees the suns go down;
1154,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nay, from the cloisters whence the refluent tide"
1155,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Wafts their pale students to our Mother's side,--"
1156,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Mid all the tumult that the day shall bring,"
1157,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"While all the echoes shout, and roar, and ring,"
1158,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"These tinkling lines, oblivion's easy prey,"
1159,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Once more emerging to the light of day,"
1160,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all unpleasing to the listening ear
1161,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Shall wake the memories of this bygone year,"
1162,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Heard as I hear the measured drops that flow
1163,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From the gray rock of wooded Fontainebleau.
1164,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1165,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Yet, ere I leave, one loving word for all"

1168,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Youth, the fair bud that holds life's opening flower,"
1169,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Full of high hopes no coward doubts enchain,"
1170,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"With all the future throbbing in its brain,"
1171,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And mightiest instincts which the beating heart
1172,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Fills with the fire its burning waves impart.
1173,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1174,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"O joyous youth, whose glory is to dare,--"
1175,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thy foot firm planted on the lowest stair,"
1176,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Thine eye uplifted to the loftiest height
1177,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Where Fame stands beckoning in the rosy light,"
1178,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thanks for thy flattering tales, thy fond deceits,"
1179,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thy loving lies, thy cheerful smiling cheats"
1180,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nature's rash promise every day is broke,--"
1181,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"A thousand acorns breed a single oak,"
1182,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,The myriad blooms that make the orchard gay
1183,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,In barren beauty throw their lives away;
1184,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Yet shall we quarrel with the sap that yields
1185,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The painted blossoms which adorn the fields,"
1186,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,When the fair orchard wears its May-day suit
1187,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Of pink-white petals, for its scanty fruit?"
1188,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Thrice happy hours, in hope's illusion dressed,"
1189,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"In fancy's cradle nurtured and caressed,"

1191,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"To thee the dewdrops of the Orient cling,--"
1192,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Not all the dye-stuffs from the vats of truth
1193,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Can match the rainbow on the robes of youth!
1194,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,

1196,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"We leave you, fearless, when we lie in dust:"
1197,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While o'er these walls the Christian banner waves
1198,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,From hallowed lips shall flow the truth that saves;
1199,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,While o'er those portals Veritas you read
1200,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,No church shall bind you with its human creed.
1201,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Take from the past the best its toil has won,"
1202,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,But learn betimes its slavish ruts to shun.
1203,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Pass the old tree whose withered leaves are shed,"
1204,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Quit the old paths that error loved to tread,"
1205,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"And a new wreath of living blossoms seek,"
1206,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A narrower pathway up a loftier peak;
1207,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Lose not your reverence, but unmanly fear"
1208,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Leave far behind you, all who enter here!"
1209,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,
1210,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,As once of old from Ida's lofty height
1211,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"The flaming signal flashed across the night,"
1212,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,So Harvard's beacon sheds its unspent rays
1213,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Till every watch-tower shows its kindling blaze.
1214,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Caught from a spark and fanned by every gale,"
1215,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,A brighter radiance gilds the roofs of Yale;
1216,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Amherst and Williams bid their flambeaus shine,"
1217,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,And Bowdoin answers through her groves of pine;
1218,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"O'er Princeton's sands the far reflections steal,"
1219,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Where mighty Edwards stamped his iron heel;
1220,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Nay, on the hill where old beliefs were bound"
1221,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Fast as if Styx had girt them nine times round,"
1222,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,Bursts such a light that trembling souls inquire
1223,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,If the whole church of Calvin is on fire!
1224,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,"Well may they ask, for what so brightly burns"
1225,OF THE FOUNDING OF HARVARD COLLEGE,As a dry creed that nothing ever learns?

1718,I.,I.
1719,I.,
1720,I.,FALLEN with autumn's falling leaf
1721,I.,"Ere yet his summer's noon was past,"
1722,I.,"Our friend, our guide, our trusted chief,--"
1723,I.,What words can match a woe so vast!
1724,I.,
1725,I.,And whose the chartered claim to speak
1726,I.,"The sacred grief where all have part,"
1727,I.,Where sorrow saddens every cheek
1728,I.,And broods in every aching heart?
1729,I.,
1730,I.,Yet Nature prompts the burning phrase
1731,I.,"That thrills the hushed and shrouded hall,"
1732,I.,"The loud lament, the sorrowing praise,"
1733,I.,The silent tear that love lets fall.
1734,I.,
1735,I.,"In loftiest verse, in lowliest rhyme,"
1736,I.,"Shall strive unblamed the minstrel choir,---"
1737,I.,"The singers of the new-born time,"
1738,I.,And trembling age with outworn lyre.
1739,I.,
1740,I.,"No room for pride, no place for blame,--"
1741,I.,"We fling our blossoms on the grave,"
1742,I.,"Pale,--scentless,--faded,--all we claim,"
1743,I.,"This only,--what we had we gave."
1744,I.,
1745,I.,"Ah, could the grief of all who mourn"
1746,I.,"Blend in one voice its bitter cry,"
1747,I.,The wail to heaven's high arches borne
1748,I.,Would echo through the caverned sky.
1749,I.,
1750,I.,
1751,II.,II.
1752,II.,
1753,II.,"O happiest land, whose peaceful choice"
1754,II.,Fills with a breath its empty throne!
1755,II.,"God, speaking through thy people's voice,"
1756,II.,Has made that voice for once His own.
1757,II.,
1758,II.,No angry passion shakes the state
1759,II.,Whose weary servant seeks for rest;
1760,II.,And who could fear that scowling hate
1761,II.,Would strike at that unguarded breast?
1762,II.,
1763,II.,"He stands, unconscious of his doom,"
1764,II.,"In manly strength, erect, serene;"
1765,II.,Around him Summer spreads her bloom;
1766,II.,"He falls,--what horror clothes the scene!"
1767,II.,
1768,II.,How swift the sudden flash of woe
1769,II.,Where all was bright as childhood's dream!
1770,II.,As if from heaven's ethereal bow
1771,II.,Had leaped the lightning's arrowy gleam.
1772,II.,
1773,II.,Blot the foul deed from history's page;
1774,II.,Let not the all-betraying sun
1775,II.,Blush for the day that stains an age
1776,II.,When murder's blackest wreath was won.
1777,II.,
1778,II.,
1779,III.,III.
1780,III.,
1781,III.,"Pale on his couch the sufferer lies,"
1782,III.,The weary battle-ground of pain
1783,III.,Love tends his pillow; Science tries
1784,III.,"Her every art, alas! in vain."
1785,III.,
1786,III.,The strife endures how long! how long!
1787,III.,"Life, death, seem balanced in the scale,"
1788,III.,While round his bed a viewless throng
1789,III.,Await each morrow's changing tale.
1790,III.,
1791,III.,In realms the desert ocean parts
1792,III.,"What myriads watch with tear-filled eyes,"
1793,III.,"His pulse-beats echoing in their hearts,"
1794,III.,His breathings counted with their sighs!
1795,III.,
1796,III.,"Slowly the stores of life are spent,"
1797,III.,Yet hope still battles with despair;
1798,III.,Will Heaven not yield when knees are bent?
1799,III.,"Answer, O thou that hearest prayer."
1800,III.,
1801,III.,But silent is the brazen sky;
1802,III.,"On sweeps the meteor's threatening train,"
1803,III.,"Unswerving Nature's mute reply,"
1804,III.,Bound in her adamantine chain.
1805,III.,
1806,III.,Not ours the verdict to decide
1807,III.,Whom death shall claim or skill shall save;
1808,III.,"The hero's life though Heaven denied,"
1809,III.,It gave our land a martyr's grave.
1810,III.,
1811,III.,Nor count the teaching vainly sent
1812,III.,"How human hearts their griefs may share,--"
1813,III.,"The lesson woman's love has lent,"
1814,III.,"What hope may do, what faith can bear!"
1815,III.,
1816,III.,Farewell! the leaf-strown earth enfolds
1817,III.,"Our stay, our pride, our hopes, our fears,"
1818,III.,And autumn's golden sun beholds
1819,III.,"A nation bowed, a world in tears."

2171,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2172,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,THOU shouldst have sung the swan-song for the choir
2173,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,That filled our groves with music till the day
2174,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Lit the last hilltop with its reddening fire,"
2175,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,And evening listened for thy lingering lay.
2176,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2177,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,But thou hast found thy voice in realms afar
2178,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Where strains celestial blend their notes with thine;
2179,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Some cloudless sphere beneath a happier star
2180,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Welcomes the bright-winged spirit we resign.
2181,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2182,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,How Nature mourns thee in the still retreat
2183,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Where passed in peace thy love-enchanted hours!
2184,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Where shall she find an eye like thine to greet
2185,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Spring's earliest footprints on her opening flowers?
2186,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2187,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Have the pale wayside weeds no fond regret
2188,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,For him who read the secrets they enfold?
2189,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Shall the proud spangles of the field forget
2190,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,The verse that lent new glory to their gold?
2191,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2192,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"And ye whose carols wooed his infant ear,"
2193,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Whose chants with answering woodnotes he repaid,"
2194,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Have ye no song his spirit still may hear
2195,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,From Elmwood's vaults of overarching shade?

2197,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Friends of his studious hours, who thronged to teach"
2198,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"The deep-read scholar all your varied lore,"

2200,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,The treasure missing from his world-wide store?
2201,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2202,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,This singer whom we long have held so dear
2203,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Was Nature's darling, shapely, strong, and fair;"
2204,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Of keenest wit, of judgment crystal-clear,"
2205,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Easy of converse, courteous, debonair,"
2206,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2207,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Fit for the loftiest or the lowliest lot,"
2208,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Self-poised, imperial, yet of simplest ways;"
2209,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"At home alike in castle or in cot,"
2210,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"True to his aim, let others blame or praise."
2211,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2212,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Freedom he found an heirloom from his sires;
2213,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Song, letters, statecraft, shared his years in turn;"
2214,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,All went to feed the nation's altar-fires
2215,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Whose mourning children wreathe his funeral urn.
2216,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2217,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"He loved New England,--people, language, soil,"
2218,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Unweaned by exile from her arid breast.
2219,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Farewell awhile, white-handed son of toil,"
2220,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Go with her brown-armed laborers to thy rest.
2221,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,
2222,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,Peace to thy slumber in the forest shade!
2223,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Poet and patriot, every gift was thine;"
2224,JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL,"Thy name shall live while summers bloom and fade,"
