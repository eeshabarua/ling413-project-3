334,Z,"_Where are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley,"
335,Z,"The weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the"
336,Z,fighter?
337,Z,"All, all are sleeping on the hill."
338,Z,
339,Z,"One passed in a fever,"
340,Z,"One was burned in a mine,"
341,Z,"One was killed in a brawl,"
342,Z,"One died in a jail,"
343,Z,One fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife—
344,Z,"All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill."
345,Z,
346,Z,"Where are Ella, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith,"
347,Z,"The tender heart, the simple soul, the loud, the proud, the happy one?—"
348,Z,"All, all are sleeping on the hill."
349,Z,
350,Z,"One died in shameful child-birth,"
351,Z,"One of a thwarted love,"
352,Z,"One at the hands of a brute in a brothel,"
353,Z,"One of a broken pride, in the search for heart’s desire;"
354,Z,One after life in far-away London and Paris
355,Z,Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag—
356,Z,"All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill."
357,Z,
358,Z,"Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily,"
359,Z,"And old Towny Kincaid and Sevigne Houghton,"
360,Z,And Major Walker who had talked
361,Z,With venerable men of the revolution?—
362,Z,"All, all are sleeping on the hill."
363,Z,
364,Z,"They brought them dead sons from the war,"
365,Z,"And daughters whom life had crushed,"
366,Z,"And their children fatherless, crying—"
367,Z,"All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill."
368,Z,
369,Z,Where is Old Fiddler Jones
370,Z,"Who played with life all his ninety years,"
371,Z,"Braving the sleet with bared breast,"
372,Z,"Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin,"
373,Z,"Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven?"
374,Z,"Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago,"
375,Z,"Of the horse-races of long ago at Clary’s Grove,"
376,Z,Of what Abe Lincoln said
377,Z,One time at Springfield._

383,Z,
384,Z,
385,Z,Here I lie close to the grave
386,Z,"Of Old Bill Piersol,"
387,Z,"Who grew rich trading with the Indians, and who"
388,Z,Afterwards took the Bankrupt Law
389,Z,And emerged from it richer than ever
390,Z,Myself grown tired of toil and poverty
391,Z,And beholding how Old Bill and others grew in wealth
392,Z,"Robbed a traveler one Night near Proctor’s Grove,"
393,Z,"Killing him unwittingly while doing so,"
394,Z,For which I was tried and hanged.
395,Z,That was my way of going into bankruptcy.
396,Z,Now we who took the bankrupt law in our respective ways
397,Z,Sleep peacefully side by side.

402,Z,Ollie McGee
403,Z,
404,Z,
405,Z,Have you seen walking through the village
406,Z,A man with downcast eyes and haggard face?
407,Z,"That is my husband who, by secret cruelty"
408,Z,"Never to be told, robbed me of my youth and my beauty;"
409,Z,"Till at last, wrinkled and with yellow teeth,"
410,Z,"And with broken pride and shameful humility,"
411,Z,I sank into the grave.
412,Z,But what think you gnaws at my husband’s heart?
413,Z,"The face of what I was, the face of what he made me!"
414,Z,These are driving him to the place where I lie.
415,Z,"In death, therefore, I am avenged."

420,Z,Fletcher McGee
421,Z,
422,Z,
423,Z,"She took my strength by minutes,"
424,Z,"She took my life by hours,"
425,Z,She drained me like a fevered moon
426,Z,That saps the spinning world.
427,Z,"The days went by like shadows,"
428,Z,The minutes wheeled like stars.
429,Z,"She took the pity from my heart,"
430,Z,And made it into smiles.
431,Z,"She was a hunk of sculptor’s clay,"
432,Z,My secret thoughts were fingers:
433,Z,They flew behind her pensive brow
434,Z,And lined it deep with pain.
435,Z,"They set the lips, and sagged the cheeks,"
436,Z,And drooped the eye with sorrow.
437,Z,"My soul had entered in the clay,"
438,Z,Fighting like seven devils.
439,Z,"It was not mine, it was not hers;"
440,Z,"She held it, but its struggles"
441,Z,"Modeled a face she hated,"
442,Z,And a face I feared to see.
443,Z,"I beat the windows, shook the bolts."
444,Z,I hid me in a corner
445,Z,"And then she died and haunted me,"
446,Z,And hunted me for life.

449,Z,
450,Z,
451,Z,Robert Fulton Tanner
452,Z,
453,Z,
454,Z,If a man could bite the giant hand
455,Z,"That catches and destroys him,"
456,Z,As I was bitten by a rat
457,Z,"While demonstrating my patent trap,"
458,Z,In my hardware store that day.
459,Z,But a man can never avenge himself
460,Z,On the monstrous ogre Life.
461,Z,You enter the room—that’s being born;
462,Z,"And then you must live—work out your soul,"
463,Z,Aha! the bait that you crave is in view:
464,Z,"A woman with money you want to marry,"
465,Z,"Prestige, place, or power in the world."
466,Z,But there’s work to do and things to conquer—
467,Z,"Oh, yes! the wires that screen the bait."
468,Z,At last you get in—but you hear a step:
469,Z,"The ogre, Life, comes into the room,"
470,Z,(He was waiting and heard the clang of the spring)
471,Z,"To watch you nibble the wondrous cheese,"
472,Z,"And stare with his burning eyes at you,"
473,Z,"And scowl and laugh, and mock and curse you,"
474,Z,"Running up and down in the trap,"
475,Z,Until your misery bores him.

480,Z,Cassius Hueffer
481,Z,
482,Z,
483,Z,They have chiseled on my stone the words:
484,Z,"“His life was gentle, and the elements so mixed in him"
485,Z,"That nature might stand up and say to all the world,"
486,Z,This was a man.”
487,Z,Those who knew me smile
488,Z,As they read this empty rhetoric.
489,Z,My epitaph should have been:
490,Z,"“Life was not gentle to him,"
491,Z,And the elements so mixed in him
492,Z,That he made warfare on life
493,Z,In the which he was slain.”
494,Z,"While I lived I could not cope with slanderous tongues,"
495,Z,Now that I am dead I must submit to an epitaph
496,Z,Graven by a fool!

501,Z,Serepta Mason
502,Z,
503,Z,
504,Z,My life’s blossom might have bloomed on all sides
505,Z,Save for a bitter wind which stunted my petals
506,Z,On the side of me which you in the village could see.
507,Z,From the dust I lift a voice of protest:
508,Z,My flowering side you never saw!
509,Z,"Ye living ones, ye are fools indeed"
510,Z,Who do not know the ways of the wind
511,Z,And the unseen forces
512,Z,That govern the processes of life.

516,Z,
517,Z,Amanda Barker
518,Z,
519,Z,
520,Z,"Henry got me with child,"
521,Z,Knowing that I could not bring forth life
522,Z,Without losing my own.
523,Z,In my youth therefore I entered the portals of dust.
524,Z,"Traveler, it is believed in the village where I lived"
525,Z,That Henry loved me with a husband’s love
526,Z,But I proclaim from the dust
527,Z,That he slew me to gratify his hatred.

531,Z,
532,Z,Constance Hately
533,Z,
534,Z,
535,Z,"You praise my self-sacrifice, Spoon River,"
536,Z,"In rearing Irene and Mary,"
537,Z,Orphans of my older sister!
538,Z,And you censure Irene and Mary
539,Z,For their contempt for me!
540,Z,But praise not my self-sacrifice.
541,Z,And censure not their contempt;
542,Z,"I reared them, I cared for them, true enough!—"
543,Z,But I poisoned my benefactions
544,Z,With constant reminders of their dependence.

549,Z,Chase Henry
550,Z,
551,Z,
552,Z,In life I was the town drunkard;
553,Z,When I died the priest denied me burial
554,Z,In holy ground.
555,Z,The which redounded to my good fortune.
556,Z,"For the Protestants bought this lot,"
557,Z,"And buried my body here,"
558,Z,"Close to the grave of the banker Nicholas,"
559,Z,And of his wife Priscilla.
560,Z,"Take note, ye prudent and pious souls,"
561,Z,Of the cross—currents in life
562,Z,"Which bring honor to the dead, who lived in shame"

567,Z,Harry Carey Goodhue
568,Z,
569,Z,
570,Z,"You never marveled, dullards of Spoon River,"
571,Z,When Chase Henry voted against the saloons
572,Z,To revenge himself for being shut off.
573,Z,But none of you was keen enough
574,Z,"To follow my steps, or trace me home"
575,Z,As Chase’s spiritual brother.
576,Z,Do you remember when I fought
577,Z,"The bank and the courthouse ring,"
578,Z,For pocketing the interest on public funds?
579,Z,And when I fought our leading citizens
580,Z,For making the poor the pack-horses of the taxes?
581,Z,And when I fought the water works
582,Z,For stealing streets and raising rates?
583,Z,And when I fought the business men
584,Z,Who fought me in these fights?
585,Z,Then do you remember:
586,Z,"That staggering up from the wreck of defeat,"
587,Z,"And the wreck of a ruined career,"
588,Z,"I slipped from my cloak my last ideal,"
589,Z,"Hidden from all eyes until then,"
590,Z,"Like the cherished jawbone of an ass,"
591,Z,"And smote the bank and the water works,"
592,Z,"And the business men with prohibition,"
593,Z,And made Spoon River pay the cost
594,Z,Of the fights that I had lost.

1162,Z,By that estranged young soul

1164,Z,By marrying the old man.
1165,Z,Then I took morphine and sat down to read.

1224,Z,"And my back was weak, and I worried and worried,"
1225,Z,"And I was embarrassed and stammered my lessons,"

1227,Z,Everything that I had studied.
1228,Z,"Well, I saw Dr. Weese’s advertisement,"

1249,Z,"And soon his body, colored like soap-stone,"
1250,Z,Gemmed with eyes of jet.
1251,Z,And you wondered in a trance of thought
1252,Z,"What he knew, what he desired, and why he lived at all."
1253,Z,But later your vision watched for men and women
1254,Z,"Hiding in burrows of fate amid great cities,"

1271,Z,"Before I joined the church, I killed a Swede"
1272,Z,At the saw-mill near Maple Grove.
1273,Z,"And they wanted a terrible man,"

1275,Z,"And a hater of saloons and drinkers,"
1276,Z,To keep law and order in the village.
1277,Z,And they presented me with a loaded cane

1279,Z,Before he drew the gun with which he killed me.

1633,Z,From the skating rink or the revival.
1634,Z,No sooner did my departing footsteps die away
1635,Z,"Than Lucius Atherton,"
1636,Z,(So I learned when Aner went to Peoria)
1637,Z,"Stole in at her window, or took her riding"
1638,Z,Behind his spanking team of bays
1639,Z,Into the country.
1640,Z,The shock of it made me settle down
1641,Z,And I put all the money I got from my father’s estate
1642,Z,"Into the canning factory, to get the job"

1658,Z,"For every noon for thirty years,"
1659,Z,I slipped behind the prescription partition

1719,Z,Like the girls when dancing at Little Grove.
1720,Z,To Cooney Potter a pillar of dust
1721,Z,Or whirling leaves meant ruinous drouth;

1725,Z,"Not to speak of getting more,"
1726,Z,"With a medley of horns, bassoons and piccolos"
1727,Z,Stirred in my brain by crows and robins
1728,Z,And the creak of a wind-mill—only these?
1729,Z,And I never started to plow in my life
1730,Z,That some one did not stop in the road
1731,Z,And take me away to a dance or picnic.
1732,Z,I ended up with forty acres;

1750,Z,Nevertheless the story clung to me.

1772,Z,"I blinded its eyes, and it became hatred—"
1773,Z,Deadly ivy instead of clematis.

1810,Z,A boat with a furled sail at rest in a harbor.
1811,Z,In truth it pictures not my destination
1812,Z,But my life.
1813,Z,For love was offered me and I shrank from its disillusionment;
1814,Z,"Sorrow knocked at my door, but I was afraid;"
1815,Z,"Ambition called to me, but I dreaded the chances."
1816,Z,Yet all the while I hungered for meaning in my life.
1817,Z,And now I know that we must lift the sail
1818,Z,And catch the winds of destiny
1819,Z,Wherever they drive the boat.

1834,Z,"For I was seventy, she was thirty—five,"
1835,Z,And I wore myself to a shadow trying to husband
1836,Z,"Jenny, rosy Jenny full of the ardor of life."
1837,Z,For all my wisdom and grace of mind
1838,Z,"Gave her no delight at all, in very truth,"
1839,Z,But ever and anon she spoke of the giant strength

1860,Z,And at the same time see yourself.
1861,Z,You are submerged in the tub of yourself—

1927,Z,"And all my hopes for the world,"
1928,Z,"And all my beliefs in Truth,"
1929,Z,Were smelted up in the blinding heat
1930,Z,"Of my devotion to you,"
1931,Z,And molded into your image.
1932,Z,And then when I found what you were:
1933,Z,That your soul was small
1934,Z,And your words were false
1935,Z,"As your blue-white porcelain teeth,"
1936,Z,"And your cuffs of celluloid,"

2083,Z,Always looking forward to some leisure

2086,Z,And host to Matthew Arnold and to Emerson.

2090,Z,Not even a little tablet in Chicago

2105,Z,And we never had any peace with our treasure.
2106,Z,"The murrain took the cattle, and the crops failed."
2107,Z,And lightning struck the granary.
2108,Z,So we mortgaged the farm to keep going.
2109,Z,And he grew silent and was worried all the time.
2110,Z,"Then some of the neighbors refused to speak to us,"
2111,Z,And took sides with his brothers and sisters.
2112,Z,"And I had no place to turn, as one may say to himself,"
2113,Z,At an earlier time in life;

2115,Z,With a little trip to Decatur.”
2116,Z,Then the dreadfulest smells infested the rooms.

2129,Z,Set fire to the house
2130,Z,They were trying Dr. Duval
2131,Z,"For the murder of Zora Clemens,"
2132,Z,And I sat in the court two weeks
2133,Z,Listening to every witness.
2134,Z,It was clear he had got her in a family way;
2135,Z,And to let the child be born
2136,Z,Would not do.
2137,Z,"Well, how about me with eight children,"
2138,Z,"And one coming, and the farm"
2139,Z,Mortgaged to Thomas Rhodes?
2140,Z,"And when I got home that night,"
2141,Z,"(After listening to the story of the buggy ride,"
2142,Z,"And the finding of Zora in the ditch,)"
2143,Z,"The first thing I saw, right there by the steps,"
2144,Z,"Where the boys had hacked for angle worms,"
2145,Z,Was the hatchet!
2146,Z,"And just as I entered there was my wife,"
2147,Z,"Standing before me, big with child."
2148,Z,"She started the talk of the mortgaged farm,"
2149,Z,And I killed her.

2162,Z,"Was made as one dead by light too bright for eyes,"

2164,Z,Steel forceps fumbled by a doctor’s hand
2165,Z,Against my boy’s head as he entered life
2166,Z,Made him an idiot. I turned to books of science
2167,Z,To care for him.
2168,Z,That’s how the world of those whose minds are sick
2169,Z,"Became my work in life, and all my world."

2182,Z,Later they locked me up as insane
2183,Z,Where I was beaten to death by a Catholic guard.
2184,Z,My offense was this:
2185,Z,"I said God lied to Adam, and destined him"
2186,Z,"To lead the life of a fool,"
2187,Z,Ignorant that there is evil in the world as well as good.
2188,Z,And when Adam outwitted God by eating the apple
2189,Z,"And saw through the lie,"
2190,Z,God drove him out of Eden to keep him from taking
2191,Z,The fruit of immortal life.
2192,Z,"For Christ’s sake, you sensible people,"
2193,Z,Here’s what God Himself says about it in the book of Genesis:

2195,Z,"Is become as one of us” (a little envy, you see),"
2196,Z,“To know good and evil” (The all-is-good lie exposed):

2198,Z,"Also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever:"

2218,Z,There on that afternoon in June

2457,Z,Made her nest in a hole of the high clay-bank
2458,Z,There near Miller’s Ford.
2459,Z,But no sooner were the young hatched
2460,Z,Than a snake crawled up to the nest
2461,Z,To devour the brood.
2462,Z,Then the mother swallow with swift flutterings
2463,Z,And shrill cries
2464,Z,"Fought at the snake,"
2465,Z,"Blinding him with the beat of her wings,"
2466,Z,"Until he, wriggling and rearing his head,"
2467,Z,Fell backward down the bank
2468,Z,Into Spoon River and was drowned.
2469,Z,Scarcely an hour passed
2470,Z,Until a shrike
2471,Z,Impaled the mother swallow on a thorn.
2472,Z,As for myself I overcame my lower nature

2483,Z,On the village square.
2484,Z,It gave my beloved flock the chance
2485,Z,To get something which had belonged to me
2486,Z,For a memorial.
2487,Z,But that trunk which was struck off
2488,Z,"To Burchard, the grog-keeper!"

2505,Z,"New England, Republicans, Calvinists, merchants, bankers,"
2506,Z,"Hating me, yet fearing my arm."
2507,Z,With wife and children heavy to carry—
2508,Z,Yet fruits of my very zest of life.
2509,Z,"Stealing odd pleasures that cost me prestige,"

2559,Z,For I raised a brood of eagles

2562,Z,"Then, with the ambition to prefix"

2637,Z,All raised there
2638,Z,"In the great mansion—house, at the edge of town."
2639,Z,Note the cedar tree on the lawn!
2640,Z,"I sent all the boys to Ann Arbor, all of the girls to Rockford,"
2641,Z,"The while my life went on, getting more riches and honors—"
2642,Z,Resting under my cedar tree at evening.
2643,Z,The years went on.
2644,Z,I sent the girls to Europe;
2645,Z,I dowered them when married.
2646,Z,I gave the boys money to start in business.
2647,Z,"They were strong children, promising as apples"
2648,Z,Before the bitten places show.
2649,Z,But John fled the country in disgrace.
2650,Z,Jenny died in child-birth—
2651,Z,I sat under my cedar tree.
2652,Z,"Harry killed himself after a debauch,"
2653,Z,Susan was divorced—
2654,Z,I sat under my cedar tree.
2655,Z,"Paul was invalided from over study,"
2656,Z,Mary became a recluse at home for love of a man—
2657,Z,I sat under my cedar tree.
2658,Z,"All were gone, or broken-winged or devoured by life—"
2659,Z,I sat under my cedar tree.
2660,Z,"My mate, the mother of them, was taken—"
2661,Z,"I sat under my cedar tree,"

2672,Z,How you stole in the room (where I lay so ill)
2673,Z,"In your nurse’s cap and linen cuffs,"
2674,Z,And took my hand and said with a smile:
2675,Z,“You are not so ill—you’ll soon be well.”
2676,Z,And how the liquid thought of your eyes
2677,Z,Sank in my eyes like dew that slips
2678,Z,Into the heart of a flower.
2679,Z,Dear Jane! the whole McNeely fortune
2680,Z,"Could not have bought your care of me,"
2681,Z,"By day and night, and night and day;"
2682,Z,"Nor paid for your smile, nor the warmth of your soul,"
2683,Z,In your little hands laid on my brow.
2684,Z,"Jane, till the flame of life went out"
2685,Z,In the dark above the disk of night
2686,Z,I longed and hoped to be well again
2687,Z,"To pillow my head on your little breasts,"
2688,Z,And hold you fast in a clasp of love—

2701,Z,When the beloved one withdraws itself from your soul
2702,Z,Then you have lost your soul.
2703,Z,"It is written: “l have a friend,"

2705,Z,"Hence my long years of solitude at the home of my father,"
2706,Z,"Trying to get myself back,"
2707,Z,And to turn my sorrow into a supremer self.
2708,Z,"But there was my father with his sorrows,"
2709,Z,"Sitting under the cedar tree,"
2710,Z,A picture that sank into my heart at last
2711,Z,Bringing infinite repose.
2712,Z,"Oh, ye souls who have made life"

2726,Z,"Stole into my life somehow, and won me away."
2727,Z,Then after some years whom should I meet
2728,Z,But Georgine Miner from Niles—a sprout
2729,Z,"Of the free love, Fourierist gardens that flourished"
2730,Z,Before the war all over Ohio.
2731,Z,"Her dilettante lover had tired of her,"
2732,Z,And she turned to me for strength and solace.
2733,Z,She was some kind of a crying thing
2734,Z,"One takes in one’s arms, and all at once"
2735,Z,"It slimes your face with its running nose,"
2736,Z,And voids its essence all over you;
2737,Z,Then bites your hand and springs away.
2738,Z,And there you stand bleeding and smelling to heaven
2739,Z,"Why, Mary McNeely, I was not worthy"

2748,Z,"A stepmother drove me from home, embittering me."
2749,Z,"A squaw-man, a flaneur and dilettante took my virtue."
2750,Z,For years I was his mistress—no one knew.
2751,Z,I learned from him the parasite cunning
2752,Z,"With which I moved with the bluffs, like a flea on a dog."
2753,Z,"All the time I was nothing but “very private,” with different men."
2754,Z,"Then Daniel, the radical, had me for years."
2755,Z,His sister called me his mistress;
2756,Z,And Daniel wrote me:
2757,Z,"“Shameful word, soiling our beautiful love!”"
2758,Z,"But my anger coiled, preparing its fangs."
2759,Z,My Lesbian friend next took a hand.
2760,Z,She hated Daniel’s sister.
2761,Z,And Daniel despised her midget husband.
2762,Z,And she saw a chance for a poisonous thrust:
2763,Z,I must complain to the wife of Daniel’s pursuit!
2764,Z,But before I did that I begged him to fly to London with me.
2765,Z,“Why not stay in the city just as we have?” he asked.
2766,Z,Then I turned submarine and revenged his repulse
2767,Z,In the arms of my dilettante friend.
2768,Z,"Then up to the surface, Bearing the letter that Daniel wrote me"
2769,Z,"To prove my honor was all intact, showing it to his wife,"
2770,Z,My Lesbian friend and everyone.
2771,Z,If Daniel had only shot me dead!

2785,Z,"You Margaret Fuller Slacks, Petits,"
2786,Z,And Tennessee Claflin Shopes—
2787,Z,You found with all your boasted wisdom
2788,Z,How hard at the last it is
2789,Z,To keep the soul from splitting into cellular atoms.
2790,Z,"While we, seekers of earth’s treasures"

2802,Z,"At our Chautauqua, and studied French"
2803,Z,"For twenty years, committing the grammar"
2804,Z,"Almost by heart,"
2805,Z,I thought I’d take a trip to Paris
2806,Z,To give my culture a final polish.
2807,Z,So I went to Peoria for a passport—
2808,Z,(Thomas Rhodes was on the train that morning.)
2809,Z,And there the clerk of the district Court
2810,Z,Made me swear to support and defend
2811,Z,"The constitution—yes, even me—"
2812,Z,Who couldn’t defend or support it at all!
2813,Z,And what do you think? That very morning
2814,Z,"The Federal Judge, in the very next room"
2815,Z,"To the room where I took the oath,"
2816,Z,Decided the constitution
2817,Z,Exempted Rhodes from paying taxes

2827,Z,From trying to put my mind in the camera
2828,Z,To catch the soul of the person.
2829,Z,The very best picture I ever took
2830,Z,"Was of Judge Somers, attorney at law."
2831,Z,He sat upright and had me pause
2832,Z,Till he got his cross-eye straight.
2833,Z,Then when he was ready he said “all right.”
2834,Z,And I yelled “overruled” and his eye turned up.

2846,Z,For singing “Turkey in the straw” or
2847,Z,“There is a fountain filled with blood”—
2848,Z,(Like Rile Potter used to sing it over at Concord).
2849,Z,"For cards, or for Rev. Peet’s lecture on the holy land;"
2850,Z,"For skipping the light fantastic, or passing the plate;"
2851,Z,"For Pinafore, or a Sunday school cantata;"
2852,Z,"For men, or for money;"
2853,Z,For the people or against them.
2854,Z,"This was it: Rev. Peet and the Social Purity Club,"
2855,Z,"Headed by Ben Pantier’s wife,"
2856,Z,"Went to the Village trustees,"
2857,Z,And asked them to make me take Dom Pedro
2858,Z,"From the barn of Wash McNeely, there at the edge of town,"
2859,Z,"To a barn outside of the corporation,"
2860,Z,On the ground that it corrupted public morals.

2870,Z,I grew spiritually fat living off the souls of men.
2871,Z,If I saw a soul that was strong
2872,Z,I wounded its pride and devoured its strength.
2873,Z,The shelters of friendship knew my cunning
2874,Z,For where I could steal a friend I did so.
2875,Z,And wherever I could enlarge my power
2876,Z,"By undermining ambition, I did so,"
2877,Z,Thus to make smooth my own.
2878,Z,"And to triumph over other souls,"
2879,Z,"Just to assert and prove my superior strength,"
2880,Z,"Was with me a delight,"
2881,Z,The keen exhilaration of soul gymnastics.
2882,Z,"Devouring souls, I should have lived forever."
2883,Z,"But their undigested remains bred in me a deadly nephritis,"
2884,Z,"With fear, restlessness, sinking spirits,"

2899,Z,On a summer’s day when she was away
2900,Z,He stole into the kitchen and took me
2901,Z,"Right in his arms and kissed me on my throat,"
2902,Z,I turning my head. Then neither of us
2903,Z,Seemed to know what happened.
2904,Z,And I cried for what would become of me.
2905,Z,And cried and cried as my secret began to show.
2906,Z,"One day Mrs. Greene said she understood,"
2907,Z,"And would make no trouble for me,"
2908,Z,"And, being childless, would adopt it."
2909,Z,(He had given her a farm to be still.)
2910,Z,"So she hid in the house and sent out rumors,"
2911,Z,As if it were going to happen to her.
2912,Z,And all went well and the child was born—
2913,Z,They were so kind to me.
2914,Z,"Later I married Gus Wertman, and years passed."
2915,Z,But—at political rallies when sitters-by thought I was crying
2916,Z,At the eloquence of Hamilton Greene—

2946,Z,In youth my mind was just a mirror
2947,Z,"In a rapidly flying car,"
2948,Z,Which catches and loses bits of the landscape.
2949,Z,Then in time
2950,Z,"Great scratches were made on the mirror,"
2951,Z,"Letting the outside world come in,"
2952,Z,And letting my inner self look out.
2953,Z,"For this is the birth of the soul in sorrow,"
2954,Z,A birth with gains and losses.
2955,Z,"The mind sees the world as a thing apart,"
2956,Z,And the soul makes the world at one with itself.
2957,Z,A mirror scratched reflects no image—

2968,Z,My favorite metaphor was Prickett’s cow
2969,Z,"Roped out to grass, and free you know as far"
2970,Z,As the length of the rope.
2971,Z,"One day while arguing so, watching the cow"

2973,Z,"Which she had eaten bare,"
2974,Z,"Out came the stake, and tossing up her head,"

2990,Z,"I knew of her adulteries, every one."
2991,Z,"But even so, if I divorced the woman"
2992,Z,I must forsake the ministry.
2993,Z,"Therefore to do God’s work and have it crop,"
2994,Z,I bore with her
2995,Z,So lied I to myself
2996,Z,So lied I to Spoon River!
2997,Z,"Yet I tried lecturing, ran for the legislature,"

3025,Z,Denounced as the candidate of gamblers and anarchists.
3026,Z,"Then Armour started to ship dressed meat to Spoon River,"
3027,Z,Forcing me to shut down my slaughter-house
3028,Z,And my butcher shop went all to pieces.
3029,Z,The new forces of Altgeld and Armour caught me
3030,Z,"At the same time. I thought it due me, to recoup the money I lost"
3031,Z,"And to make good the friends that left me,"
3032,Z,For the Governor to appoint me Canal Commissioner.
3033,Z,"Instead he appointed Whedon of the Spoon River Argus,"
3034,Z,So I ran for the legislature and was elected.
3035,Z,I said to hell with principle and sold my vote
3036,Z,On Charles T. Yerkes’ street-car franchise.

3610,Z,"For things that are new grow old at length,"
3611,Z,They’re replaced with better or none at all:
3612,Z,People are prospering or falling back.
3613,Z,And rents and patches widen with time;
3614,Z,"No thread or needle can pace decay,"
3615,Z,"And there are stains that baffle soap,"

3617,Z,Blamed though you are for spoiling a dress.

3634,Z,"The paramour of a woman I took in self-contempt,"
3635,Z,But to hide a wounded pride as well.
3636,Z,To be judged and loathed by a village of little minds—
3637,Z,"I, gifted with tongues and wisdom,"
3638,Z,"Sunk here to the dust of the justice court,"
3639,Z,"A picker of rags in the rubbage of spites and wrongs,—"

3645,Z,When they bought the drinks to kindle my dying mind.
3646,Z,"To be judged by you,"
3647,Z,"The soul of me hidden from you,"
3648,Z,With its wound gangrened
3649,Z,"By love for a wife who made the wound,"
3650,Z,"With her cold white bosom, treasonous, pure and hard,"
3651,Z,"Relentless to the last, when the touch of her hand,"
3652,Z,"At any time, might have cured me of the typhus,"
3653,Z,Caught in the jungle of life where many are lost.
3654,Z,"And only to think that my soul could not react,"
3655,Z,"Like Byron’s did, in song, in something noble,"

3669,Z,"Till he turned right over, feathers ruffled,"
3670,Z,"With some of the down of him floating near,"
3671,Z,And fell like a plummet into the grass.
3672,Z,"I tramped about, parting the tangles,"
3673,Z,"Till I saw a splash of blood on a stump,"
3674,Z,And the quail lying close to the rotten roots.
3675,Z,"I reached my hand, but saw no brier,"
3676,Z,But something pricked and stung and numbed it.
3677,Z,"And then, in a second, I spied the rattler—"

3679,Z,"The head of him arched, sunk back in the rings of him,"
3680,Z,"A circle of filth, the color of ashes,"

3693,Z,"One, the house I built on the hill,"

3695,Z,"The other, the lake-front in Chicago,"

3698,Z,"And smoke and soot thrown over the city,"
3699,Z,"And the crash of cars along the boulevard,—"
3700,Z,A blot like a hog-pen on the harbor
3701,Z,"Of a great metropolis, foul as a sty."
3702,Z,I helped to give this heritage
3703,Z,"To generations yet unborn, with my vote"
3704,Z,"In the House of Representatives,"
3705,Z,And the lure of the thing was to be at rest
3706,Z,"From the never—ending fright of need,"
3707,Z,"And to give my daughters gentle breeding,"
3708,Z,And a sense of security in life.
3709,Z,"But, you see, though I had the mansion house"

3711,Z,"I could hear the whispers, whispers, whispers,"

3714,Z,"And they married madly, helter-skelter,"
3715,Z,Just to get out and have a change.
3716,Z,And what was the whole of the business worth?

3729,Z,How proud my mother was of the mansion
3730,Z,How proud of father’s rise in the world!
3731,Z,"And how my father loved and watched us,"
3732,Z,And guarded our happiness.
3733,Z,"But I believe the house was a curse,"
3734,Z,For father’s fortune was little beside it;
3735,Z,And when my husband found he had married
3736,Z,"A girl who was really poor,"
3737,Z,"He taunted me with the spires,"
3738,Z,"And called the house a fraud on the world,"
3739,Z,"A treacherous lure to young men, raising hopes"
3740,Z,Of a dowry not to be had;
3741,Z,And a man while selling his vote
3742,Z,Should get enough from the people’s betrayal
3743,Z,To wall the whole of his family in.

3757,Z,"Or rented a house in Paris,"
3758,Z,Where I entertained the nobility.
3759,Z,"I was forever eating or traveling,"

3778,Z,I was cut down in my prime
3779,Z,From overwork and anxiety.
3780,Z,"But I thought all along, whatever happens"
3781,Z,"I’ve kept my insurance up,"
3782,Z,"And there’s something in the bank,"
3783,Z,And a section of land in Manitoba.
3784,Z,But just as I slipped I had a vision
3785,Z,In a last delirium:
3786,Z,I saw myself lying nailed in a box
3787,Z,"With a white lawn tie and a boutonnière,"
3788,Z,And my wife was sitting by a window
3789,Z,Some place afar overlooking the sea;
3790,Z,"She seemed so rested, ruddy and fat,"
3791,Z,Although her hair was white.
3792,Z,And she smiled and said to a colored waiter:

3832,Z,And little engines with tracks to run on
3833,Z,And telephones of cans and thread.
3834,Z,"I played the cornet and painted pictures,"
3835,Z,Modeled in clay and took the part

3896,Z,I awoke one morning with the love of God
3897,Z,"Brimming over my heart, so I went to see Richard"
3898,Z,To settle the fence in the spirit of Jesus Christ.
3899,Z,"I knocked on the door, and his wife opened;"

3901,Z,"I entered— She slammed the door and began to scream,"
3902,Z,"“Take your hands off, you low down varlet!”"

3904,Z,"I waved my hands, choked up with words."

3926,Z,"A gourmand yet, investing her income"
3927,Z,"In mortgages, fretting all the time"
3928,Z,About her notes and rents and papers.
3929,Z,"That day I was sawing wood for her,"
3930,Z,And reading Proudhon in between.
3931,Z,"I went in the house for a drink of water,"

3933,Z,"And Proudhon lying on the table,"
3934,Z,"And a bottle of chloroform on the book,"
3935,Z,She used sometimes for an aching tooth!
3936,Z,I poured the chloroform on a handkerchief
3937,Z,And held it to her nose till she died.—
3938,Z,"Oh Delia, Delia, you and Proudhon"
3939,Z,"Steadied my hand, and the coroner"

4087,Z,And no one wanted colts from him.
4088,Z,"And when I tried to drive him—well,"
4089,Z,He ran away and killed me.

4097,Z,There would be a knock at the door
4098,Z,"And I would arise at midnight and go to the shop,"
4099,Z,Where belated travelers would hear me hammering
4100,Z,Sepulchral boards and tacking satin.
4101,Z,And often I wondered who would go with me
4102,Z,"To the distant land, our names the theme"
4103,Z,"For talk, in the same week, for I’ve observed"
4104,Z,Two always go together.
4105,Z,Chase Henry was paired with Edith Conant;
4106,Z,And Jonathan Somers with Willie Metcalf;
4107,Z,"And Editor Hamblin with Francis Turner,"
4108,Z,"When he prayed to live longer than Editor Whedon,"
4109,Z,And Thomas Rhodes with widow McFarlane;
4110,Z,And Emily Sparks with Barry Holden;
4111,Z,And Oscar Hummel with Davis Matlock;
4112,Z,And Editor Whedon with Fiddler Jones;
4113,Z,And Faith Matheny with Dorcas Gustine.
4114,Z,"And I, the solemnest man in town,"
4115,Z,Stepped off with Daisy Fraser.

4123,Z,I bought every kind of machine that’s known—
4124,Z,"Grinders, shellers, planters, mowers,"
4125,Z,Mills and rakes and ploughs and threshers—
4126,Z,"And all of them stood in the rain and sun,"
4127,Z,"Getting rusted, warped and battered,"
4128,Z,"For I had no sheds to store them in,"
4129,Z,And no use for most of them.
4130,Z,"And toward the last, when I thought it over,"
4131,Z,"There by my window, growing clearer"
4132,Z,"About myself, as my pulse slowed down,"
4133,Z,And looked at one of the mills I bought—
4134,Z,"Which I didn’t have the slightest need of,"
4135,Z,"As things turned out, and I never ran—"
4136,Z,"A fine machine, once brightly varnished,"
4137,Z,"And eager to do its work,"
4138,Z,Now with its paint washed off—
4139,Z,I saw myself as a good machine
4140,Z,That Life had never used.

4147,Z,
4148,Z,My mother was for woman’s rights
4149,Z,And my father was the rich miller at London Mills.
4150,Z,I dreamed of the wrongs of the world and wanted to right them.
4151,Z,"When my father died, I set out to see peoples and countries"
4152,Z,In order to learn how to reform the world.
4153,Z,I traveled through many lands. I saw the ruins of Rome
4154,Z,"And the ruins of Athens, And the ruins of Thebes."
4155,Z,And I sat by moonlight amid the necropolis of Memphis.
4156,Z,"There I was caught up by wings of flame,"
4157,Z,And a voice from heaven said to me:
4158,Z,"“Injustice, Untruth destroyed them."
4159,Z,Go forth Preach Justice! Preach Truth!”
4160,Z,And I hastened back to Spoon River
4161,Z,To say farewell to my mother before beginning my work.
4162,Z,They all saw a strange light in my eye.
4163,Z,"And by and by, when I talked, they discovered"
4164,Z,What had come in my mind.
4165,Z,Then Jonathan Swift Somers challenged me to debate
4166,Z,"The subject, (I taking the negative):"
4167,Z,"“Pontius Pilate, the Greatest Philosopher of the World.”"
4168,Z,"And he won the debate by saying at last,"
4169,Z,"“Before you reform the world, Mr. Tutt"
4170,Z,Please answer the question of Pontius Pilate:

4181,Z,But standing for the rights of property and for order.
4182,Z,"A regular church attendant,"
4183,Z,Sometimes appearing in your town meetings to warn you
4184,Z,Against the evils of discontent and envy
4185,Z,"And to denounce those who tried to destroy the Union,"
4186,Z,And to point to the peril of the Knights of Labor.
4187,Z,My success and my example are inevitable influences
4188,Z,"In your young men and in generations to come,"
4189,Z,In spite of attacks of newspapers like the _Clarion;_
4190,Z,A regular visitor at Springfield
4191,Z,When the Legislature was in session
4192,Z,To prevent raids upon the railroads
4193,Z,And the men building up the state.
4194,Z,"Trusted by them and by you, Spoon River, equally"
4195,Z,In spite of the whispers that I was a lobbyist.
4196,Z,"Moving quietly through the world, rich and courted."
4197,Z,"Dying at last, of course, but lying here"
4198,Z,Under a stone with an open book carved upon it
4199,Z,And the words _“Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.”_
4200,Z,"And now, you world-savers, who reaped nothing in life"
4201,Z,"And in death have neither stones nor epitaphs,"
4202,Z,How do you like your silence from mouths stopped
4203,Z,With the dust of my triumphant career?

4213,Z,"And stifle me with your stupidities,"
4214,Z,If you did not want me to expose them?
4215,Z,"And nail me with the nails of cruelty,"
4216,Z,If you did not want me to pluck the nails forth
4217,Z,And fling them in your faces?
4218,Z,"And starve me because I refused to obey you,"
4219,Z,If you did not want me to undermine your tyranny?
4220,Z,I might have been as soul serene
4221,Z,As William Wordsworth except for you!
4222,Z,"But what a coward you are, Spoon River,"
4223,Z,When you drove me to stand in a magic circle
4224,Z,By the sword of Truth described!
4225,Z,"And then to whine and curse your burns,"
4226,Z,And curse my power who stood and laughed

4238,Z,Arise! Do battle with the descendants of those
4239,Z,"Who bought land in the loop when it was waste sand,"
4240,Z,"And sold blankets and guns to the army of Grant,"
4241,Z,"And sat in legislatures in the early days,"
4242,Z,Taking bribes from the railroads!
4243,Z,"Arise! Do battle with the fops and bluffs,"
4244,Z,The pretenders and figurantes of the society column
4245,Z,And the yokel souls whose daughters marry counts;
4246,Z,"And the parasites on great ideas,"
4247,Z,"And the noisy riders of great causes,"
4248,Z,And the heirs of ancient thefts.
4249,Z,"Arise! And make the city yours,"
4250,Z,And the State yours—
4251,Z,You who are sons of the hardy yeomanry of the forties!
4252,Z,By God! If you do not destroy these vermin

4263,Z,"I was your leader, friends of Spoon River,"
4264,Z,"Did you neglect the convention and caucus,"
4265,Z,And leave the burden on my hands
4266,Z,Of guarding and saving the people’s cause?—
4267,Z,Sometimes because you were ill;
4268,Z,Or your grandmother was ill;
4269,Z,Or you drank too much and fell asleep;
4270,Z,"Or else you said: “He is our leader,"
4271,Z,All will be well; he fights for us;
4272,Z,We have nothing to do but follow.”
4273,Z,"But oh, how you cursed me when I fell,"
4274,Z,"And cursed me, saying I had betrayed you,"
4275,Z,"In leaving the caucus room for a moment,"
4276,Z,"When the people’s enemies, there assembled,"
4277,Z,Waited and watched for a chance to destroy
4278,Z,The Sacred Rights of the People.

4289,Z,I was a penniless girl from Summum
4290,Z,Who stepped from the morning train in Spoon River.
4291,Z,All the houses stood before me with closed doors
4292,Z,And drawn shades—I was barred out;
4293,Z,I had no place or part in any of them.
4294,Z,"And I walked past the old McNeely mansion,"
4295,Z,A castle of stone ’mid walks and gardens
4296,Z,With workmen about the place on guard
4297,Z,And the County and State upholding it
4298,Z,"For its lordly owner, full of pride."
4299,Z,I was so hungry I had a vision:
4300,Z,I saw a giant pair of scissors
4301,Z,"Dip from the sky, like the beam of a dredge,"
4302,Z,And cut the house in two like a curtain.
4303,Z,But at the “Commercial” I saw a man
4304,Z,Who winked at me as I asked for work—
4305,Z,It was Wash McNeely’s son.
4306,Z,He proved the link in the chain of title
4307,Z,"To half my ownership of the mansion,"
4308,Z,Through a breach of promise suit—the scissors.
4309,Z,"So, you see, the house, from the day I was born,"
4310,Z,Was only waiting for me.

4320,Z,"And managed for the good of inquiring minds,"
4321,Z,"Was sold at auction on the public square,"
4322,Z,As if to destroy the last vestige
4323,Z,Of my memory and influence.
4324,Z,For those of you who could not see the virtue
4325,Z,Of knowing Volney’s “Ruins” as well as Butler’s “Analogy”
4326,Z,"And “Faust” as well as “Evangeline,”"
4327,Z,"Were really the power in the village,"
4328,Z,And often you asked me
4329,Z,“What is the use of knowing the evil in the world?”
4330,Z,"I am out of your way now, Spoon River,"
4331,Z,Choose your own good and call it good.
4332,Z,For I could never make you see
4333,Z,That no one knows what is good

4343,Z,
4344,Z,It was only a little house of two rooms—
4345,Z,Almost like a child’s play-house—
4346,Z,With scarce five acres of ground around it;
4347,Z,And I had so many children to feed
4348,Z,"And school and clothe, and a wife who was sick"
4349,Z,From bearing children.
4350,Z,One day lawyer Whitney came along
4351,Z,"And proved to me that Christian Dallman,"
4352,Z,"Who owned three thousand acres of land,"
4353,Z,Had bought the eighty that adjoined me
4354,Z,In eighteen hundred and seventy-one
4355,Z,"For eleven dollars, at a sale for taxes,"
4356,Z,While my father lay in his mortal illness.
4357,Z,So the quarrel arose and I went to law.
4358,Z,"But when we came to the proof,"
4359,Z,A survey of the land showed clear as day
4360,Z,That Dallman’s tax deed covered my ground
4361,Z,And my little house of two rooms.
4362,Z,It served me right for stirring him up.
4363,Z,I lost my case and lost my place.
4364,Z,I left the court room and went to work

4375,Z,"Just to see the minnows bump each other,"
4376,Z,Until the strongest got the prize.
4377,Z,"Or I went to my little pasture,"
4378,Z,"Where the peaceful swine were asleep in the wallow,"
4379,Z,"Or nosing each other lovingly,"
4380,Z,"And emptied a basket of yellow corn,"
4381,Z,"And watched them push and squeal and bite,"
4382,Z,And trample each other to get the corn.
4383,Z,"And I saw how Christian Dallman’s farm,"
4384,Z,"Of more than three thousand acres,"
4385,Z,"Swallowed the patch of Felix Schmidt,"
4386,Z,As a bass will swallow a minnow
4387,Z,And I say if there’s anything in man—
4388,Z,"Spirit, or conscience, or breath of God"
4389,Z,"That makes him different from fishes or hogs,"
4390,Z,I’d like to see it work!

4398,Z,When I first came to Spoon River
4399,Z,I did not know whether what they told me
4400,Z,Was true or false.
4401,Z,They would bring me the epitaph
4402,Z,And stand around the shop while I worked
4403,Z,"And say “He was so kind,” “He was so wonderful,”"
4404,Z,"“She was the sweetest woman,” “He was a consistent Christian.”"
4405,Z,"And I chiseled for them whatever they wished,"
4406,Z,All in ignorance of the truth.
4407,Z,"But later, as I lived among the people here,"
4408,Z,I knew how near to the life
4409,Z,Were the epitaphs that were ordered for them as they died.
4410,Z,But still I chiseled whatever they paid me to chisel
4411,Z,And made myself party to the false chronicles
4412,Z,"Of the stones,"
4413,Z,Even as the historian does who writes
4414,Z,"Without knowing the truth,"

4426,Z,Out of the chimney of the court-house
4427,Z,A gray-hound of smoke leapt and chased
4428,Z,The northwest wind.
4429,Z,I carried a ladder to the landing of the stairs
4430,Z,And leaned it against the frame of the trap-door
4431,Z,"In the ceiling of the portico,"
4432,Z,And I crawled under the roof and amid the rafters
4433,Z,And flung among the seasoned timbers
4434,Z,A lighted handful of oil-soaked waste.
4435,Z,Then I came down and slunk away.
4436,Z,In a little while the fire-bell rang—
4437,Z,Clang! Clang! Clang!
4438,Z,And the Spoon River ladder company
4439,Z,Came with a dozen buckets and began to pour water
4440,Z,"On the glorious bon-fire, growing hotter"
4441,Z,"Higher and brighter, till the walls fell in"
4442,Z,And the limestone columns where Lincoln stood
4443,Z,Crashed like trees when the woodman fells them.
4444,Z,When I came back from Joliet
4445,Z,There was a new court house with a dome.

4459,Z,Beating the grass into long waves.
4460,Z,"My kite is above the wind,"
4461,Z,"Though now and then it wobbles,"
4462,Z,Like a man shaking his shoulders;
4463,Z,"And the tail streams out momentarily,"
4464,Z,Then sinks to rest.
4465,Z,"And the buzzards wheel and wheel,"
4466,Z,Sweeping the zenith with wide circles
4467,Z,Above my kite. And the hills sleep.
4468,Z,"And a farm house, white as snow,"
4469,Z,Peeps from green trees—far away.
4470,Z,"And I watch my kite,"
4471,Z,"For the thin moon will kindle herself ere long,"
4472,Z,Then she will swing like a pendulum dial
4473,Z,To the tail of my kite.
4474,Z,A spurt of flame like a water-dragon

4488,Z,The forest beyond the orchard is still
4489,Z,With midsummer stillness;
4490,Z,"And along the road a wagon chuckles,"
4491,Z,"Loaded with corn, going to Atterbury."
4492,Z,"And an old man sits under a tree asleep,"
4493,Z,"And an old woman crosses the road,"
4494,Z,Coming from the orchard with a bucket of blackberries.
4495,Z,And a boy lies in the grass
4496,Z,"Near the feet of the old man,"
4497,Z,"And looks up at the sailing clouds,"
4498,Z,"And longs, and longs, and longs"
4499,Z,"For what, he knows not:"
4500,Z,"For manhood, for life, for the unknown world!"
4501,Z,"Then thirty years passed,"
4502,Z,And the boy returned worn out by life
4503,Z,"And found the orchard vanished,"
4504,Z,"And the forest gone,"

4517,Z,There is a tablet of bronze
4518,Z,Containing the embossed faces

4521,Z,"In the County Board, without which"
4522,Z,"Not one stone would have been placed on another,"
4523,Z,And the contributions out of my own pocket
4524,Z,"To build the temple, are but memories among the people,"

4526,Z,With them to this oblivion where I lie?
4527,Z,"In truth, I can so believe."

4547,Z,I hadn’t seen aright the fish I had caught.

4549,Z,They got the ring master to let a tame leopard
4550,Z,"Into the ring, and made me believe"
4551,Z,I was whipping a wild beast like Samson
4552,Z,"When I, for an offer of fifty dollars,"
4553,Z,Dragged him out to his cage.
4554,Z,One time I entered my blacksmith shop
4555,Z,And shook as I saw some horse-shoes crawling
4556,Z,"Across the floor, as if alive—"
4557,Z,Walter Simmons had put a magnet
4558,Z,Under the barrel of water.
4559,Z,"Yet everyone of you, you white men,"

4573,Z,Next I used my rebel strength
4574,Z,To capture the standard of my old party—
4575,Z,"And I captured it, but I was defeated."
4576,Z,"Discredited and discarded, misanthropical,"
4577,Z,I turned to the solace of gold
4578,Z,And I used my remnant of power
4579,Z,To fasten myself like a saprophyte
4580,Z,Upon the putrescent carcass
4581,Z,"Of Thomas Rhodes, bankrupt bank,"
4582,Z,As assignee of the fund.
4583,Z,Everyone now turned from me.
4584,Z,"My hair grew white,"
4585,Z,"My purple lusts grew gray,"
4586,Z,Tobacco and whisky lost their savor
4587,Z,And for years Death ignored me
4588,Z,As he does a hog.

4597,Z,I was sick of the tiresome game in Spoon River
4598,Z,And I made up my mind to run away
4599,Z,And leave my place in life and my family;
4600,Z,"But just as the midnight train pulled in,"
4601,Z,Quick off the steps jumped Cully Green
4602,Z,"And Martin Vise, and began to fight"
4603,Z,"To settle their ancient rivalry,"
4604,Z,Striking each other with fists that sounded
4605,Z,Like the blows of knotted clubs.
4606,Z,"Now it seemed to me that Cully was winning,"
4607,Z,When his bloody face broke into a grin
4608,Z,"Of sickly cowardice, leaning on Martin"
4609,Z,"And whining out “We’re good friends, Mart,"
4610,Z,You know that I’m your friend.”
4611,Z,But a terrible punch from Martin knocked him
4612,Z,Around and around and into a heap.
4613,Z,"And then they arrested me as a witness,"
4614,Z,And I lost my train and staid in Spoon River
4615,Z,To wage my battle of life to the end.
4616,Z,"Oh, Cully Green, you were my savior—"
4617,Z,"You, so ashamed and drooped for years,"
4618,Z,"Loitering listless about the streets,"
4619,Z,"And tying rags round your festering soul,"

4631,Z,"But my friends left me and joined my enemies,"
4632,Z,And they elected a new man.
4633,Z,"Then a spirit of revenge seized me,"
4634,Z,"And I infected my four sons with it,"
4635,Z,"And I brooded upon retaliation,"
4636,Z,"Until the great physician, Nature,"
4637,Z,Smote me through with paralysis
4638,Z,To give my soul and body a rest.
4639,Z,Did my sons get power and money?
4640,Z,"Did they serve the people or yoke them,"
4641,Z,To till and harvest fields of self?
4642,Z,For how could they ever forget
4643,Z,"My face at my bed-room window,"
4644,Z,Sitting helpless amid my golden cages

4657,Z,"Child-like, watching his canaries,"
4658,Z,And looking at the court-house window
4659,Z,"Of the county judge’s room,"
4660,Z,And his admonitions to me to seek
4661,Z,"My own in life, and punish Spoon River"
4662,Z,"To avenge the wrong the people did him,"
4663,Z,Filled me with furious energy
4664,Z,To seek for wealth and seek for power.
4665,Z,But what did he do but send me along
4666,Z,The path that leads to the grove of the Furies?
4667,Z,I followed the path and I tell you this:
4668,Z,"On the way to the grove you’ll pass the Fates,"

4691,Z,"Fall on me like rain that runs off,"

4797,Z,"Speaking Italian, speaking French,"

4830,Z,All of a sudden I saw him standing
4831,Z,"Scared to death, holding his rabbits,"

5074,Z,Your devoted friendship and delicate ministrations
5075,Z,"First with diminished thanks,"
5076,Z,"Afterward by gradually withdrawing my presence from you,"
5077,Z,"So that I might not be compelled to thank you,"
5078,Z,And then with silence which followed upon
5079,Z,Our final Separation.
5080,Z,You had cured my diseased soul.
5081,Z,But to cure it
5082,Z,"You saw my disease, you knew my secret,"
5083,Z,And that is why I fled from you.
5084,Z,For though when our bodies rise from pain
5085,Z,We kiss forever the watchful hands
5086,Z,"That gave us wormwood, while we shudder"
5087,Z,"For thinking of the wormwood,"
5088,Z,"A soul that’s cured is a different matter,"
5089,Z,For there we’d blot from memory
5090,Z,"The soft-toned words, the searching eyes,"
5091,Z,"And stand forever oblivious,"
5092,Z,Not so much of the sorrow itself
5093,Z,As of the hand that healed it.

5101,Z,I was a gun-smith in Odessa.
5102,Z,One night the police broke in the room
5103,Z,Where a group of us were reading Spencer.
5104,Z,And seized our books and arrested us.
5105,Z,But I escaped and came to New York
5106,Z,"And thence to Chicago, and then to Spoon River,"
5107,Z,Where I could study my Kant in peace
5108,Z,And eke out a living repairing guns
5109,Z,Look at my moulds! My architectonics
5110,Z,"One for a barrel, one for a hammer"
5111,Z,And others for other parts of a gun!
5112,Z,"Well, now suppose no gun-smith living"
5113,Z,Had anything else but duplicate moulds
5114,Z,"Of these I show you—well, all guns"
5115,Z,"Would be just alike, with a hammer to hit"
5116,Z,The cap and a barrel to carry the shot
5117,Z,"All acting alike for themselves, and all"
5118,Z,Acting against each other alike.
5119,Z,And there would be your world of guns!
5120,Z,Which nothing could ever free from itself
5121,Z,Except a Moulder with different moulds
5122,Z,To mould the metal over.

5130,Z,"I was the Sunday-school superintendent,"
5131,Z,The dummy president of the wagon works
5132,Z,"And the canning factory,"
5133,Z,Acting for Thomas Rhodes and the banking clique;
5134,Z,"My son the cashier of the bank,"
5135,Z,"Wedded to Rhodes’ daughter,"
5136,Z,"My week days spent in making money,"
5137,Z,My Sundays at church and in prayer.
5138,Z,In everything a cog in the wheel of things-as-they-are:
5139,Z,"Of money, master and man, made white"
5140,Z,With the paint of the Christian creed.
5141,Z,And then:
5142,Z,The bank collapsed.
5143,Z,I stood and hooked at the wrecked machine—
5144,Z,The wheels with blow-holes stopped with putty and painted;
5145,Z,"The rotten bolts, the broken rods;"
5146,Z,And only the hopper for souls fit to be used again
5147,Z,"In a new devourer of life,"
5148,Z,"When newspapers, judges and money-magicians"
5149,Z,Build over again.
5150,Z,"I was stripped to the bone, but I lay in the Rock of Ages,"
5151,Z,"Seeing now through the game, no longer a dupe,"
5152,Z,And knowing “the upright shall dwell in the land
5153,Z,But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.”
5154,Z,"Then suddenly, Dr. Meyers discovered"
5155,Z,A cancer in my liver.
5156,Z,"I was not, after all, the particular care of God"
5157,Z,"Why, even thus standing on a peak"
5158,Z,"Above the mists through which I had climbed,"
5159,Z,"And ready for larger life in the world,"
5160,Z,Eternal forces
5161,Z,Moved me on with a push.

5169,Z,"I was just turned twenty-one,"
5170,Z,"And Henry Phipps, the Sunday-school superintendent,"
5171,Z,Made a speech in Bindle’s Opera House.
5172,Z,"“The honor of the flag must be upheld,” he said,"
5173,Z,“Whether it be assailed by a barbarous tribe of Tagalogs
5174,Z,Or the greatest power in Europe.”
5175,Z,And we cheered and cheered the speech and the flag he waved
5176,Z,As he spoke.
5177,Z,"And I went to the war in spite of my father,"
5178,Z,And followed the flag till I saw it raised
5179,Z,"By our camp in a rice field near Manila,"
5180,Z,And all of us cheered and cheered it.
5181,Z,But there were flies and poisonous things;
5182,Z,"And there was the deadly water,"
5183,Z,"And the cruel heat,"
5184,Z,"And the sickening, putrid food;"
5185,Z,And the smell of the trench just back of the tents
5186,Z,Where the soldiers went to empty themselves;
5187,Z,"And there were the whores who followed us, full of syphilis;"
5188,Z,"And beastly acts between ourselves or alone,"
5189,Z,"With bullying, hatred, degradation among us,"
5190,Z,And days of loathing and nights of fear
5191,Z,"To the hour of the charge through the steaming swamp,"
5192,Z,"Following the flag,"
5193,Z,"Till I fell with a scream, shot through the guts."
5194,Z,Now there’s a flag over me in

5205,Z,"Through which Rebecca followed me wailing, wailing,"
5206,Z,"One child in her arms, and three that ran along wailing,"
5207,Z,"Lengthening out the farewell to me off to the war with the British,"
5208,Z,"And then the long, hard years down to the day of Yorktown."
5209,Z,"And then my search for Rebecca,"
5210,Z,"Finding her at last in Virginia,"
5211,Z,Two children dead in the meanwhile.
5212,Z,"We went by oxen to Tennessee,"
5213,Z,"Thence after years to Illinois,"
5214,Z,At last to Spoon River.
5215,Z,"We cut the buffalo grass,"
5216,Z,"We felled the forests,"
5217,Z,"We built the school houses, built the bridges,"
5218,Z,Leveled the roads and tilled the fields
5219,Z,"Alone with poverty, scourges, death—"

5231,Z,The sound of martial music;
5232,Z,The thrill of carrying a gun;
5233,Z,Advancement in the world on coming home;
5234,Z,"A glint of glory, wrath for foes;"
5235,Z,A dream of duty to country or to God.
5236,Z,"But these were things in ourselves, shining before us,"
5237,Z,"They were not the power behind us,"
5238,Z,"Which was the Almighty hand of Life,"
5239,Z,"Like fire at earth’s center making mountains,"
5240,Z,Or pent up waters that cut them through.
5241,Z,Do you remember the iron band
5242,Z,"The blacksmith, Shack Dye, welded"
5243,Z,"Around the oak on Bennet’s lawn,"
5244,Z,"From which to swing a hammock,"
5245,Z,"That daughter Janet might repose in, reading"
5246,Z,On summer afternoons?
5247,Z,And that the growing tree at last
5248,Z,Sundered the iron band?
5249,Z,But not a cell in all the tree

5261,Z,"Near Manila, following the flag"
5262,Z,"You were not wounded by the greatness of a dream,"
5263,Z,"Or destroyed by ineffectual work,"
5264,Z,Or driven to madness by Satanic snags;
5265,Z,"You were not torn by aching nerves,"
5266,Z,Nor did you carry great wounds to your old age.
5267,Z,"You did not starve, for the government fed you."
5268,Z,You did not suffer yet cry “forward”
5269,Z,To an army which you led
5270,Z,"Against a foe with mocking smiles,"
5271,Z,Sharper than bayonets.
5272,Z,You were not smitten down
5273,Z,By invisible bombs.
5274,Z,You were not rejected
5275,Z,By those for whom you were defeated.
5276,Z,You did not eat the savorless bread
5277,Z,Which a poor alchemy had made from ideals.
5278,Z,"You went to Manila, Harry Wilmans,"
5279,Z,While I enlisted in the bedraggled army
5280,Z,"Of bright-eyed, divine youths,"
5281,Z,"Who surged forward, who were driven back and fell"
5282,Z,"Sick, broken, crying, shorn of faith,"
5283,Z,Following the flag of the Kingdom of Heaven.
5284,Z,"You and I, Harry Wilmans, have fallen"
5285,Z,"In our several ways, not knowing"

5300,Z,"Thus you believe, viewing the lives of other men,"
5301,Z,"As one who in God-like fashion bends over an anthill,"
5302,Z,Seeing how their difficulties could be avoided.
5303,Z,But pass on into life:

5322,Z,"Like notes of music that run together, into winning,"
5323,Z,In the inspired improvisation of love!
5324,Z,But to put back of us as a canticle ended
5325,Z,"The rapt enchantment of the flesh,"

5327,Z,"Where time was not, nor space, nor ourselves—"

5331,Z,"And hiding itself amid flowers and mandolins,"
5332,Z,Stared at by all between salad and coffee.

5334,Z,"Prescient, as one who signs a bond—"
5335,Z,Not flaming with gifts and pledges heaped
5336,Z,With rosy hands over his brow.
5337,Z,"And then, O night! deliberate! unlovely!"
5338,Z,"With all of our wooing blotted out by the winning,"

5340,Z,"Next day he sat so listless, almost cold"
5341,Z,"So strangely changed, wondering why I wept,"

5350,Z,Gazed at by Raphael and St. Francis
5351,Z,Sometimes as they pass.

5353,Z,To be known clearly face to face
5354,Z,Through a cycle of birth hereafter run.

5390,Z,With its great yard of clover
5391,Z,"Running down to the board-fence,"
5392,Z,"Shadowed by the oak tree,"
5393,Z,Where we children had our swing.
5394,Z,Yet the little house was a manor hall
5395,Z,"Set in a lawn, and by the lawn was the sea."
5396,Z,I was in the room where little Paul
5397,Z,"Strangled from diphtheria,"
5398,Z,But yet it was not this room—
5399,Z,It was a sunny verandah enclosed
5400,Z,With mullioned windows
5401,Z,And in a chair sat a man in a dark cloak
5402,Z,With a face like Euripides.
5403,Z,"He had come to visit me, or I had gone to visit him—I could not tell."
5404,Z,"We could hear the beat of the sea, the clover nodded"
5405,Z,"Under a summer wind, and little Paul came"
5406,Z,With clover blossoms to the window and smiled.
5407,Z,"Then I said: “What is ‘divine despair,’ Alfred?”"
5408,Z,"“Have you read ‘Tears, Idle Tears’?” he asked."
5409,Z,"“Yes, but you do not there express divine despair.”"
5410,Z,"“My poor friend,” he answered, “that was why the despair"
5411,Z,Was divine.”

5422,Z,You cannot speak!
5423,Z,You do not need to speak—
5424,Z,"Everyone knows that you are dying of thirst,"
5425,Z,Yet they do not bring water!
5426,Z,"They pass on, saying:"
5427,Z,“The geranium wants water.”
5428,Z,"And I, who had happiness to share"
5429,Z,And longed to share your happiness;
5430,Z,"I who loved you, Spoon River,"
5431,Z,"And craved your love,"
5432,Z,"Withered before your eyes, Spoon River—"
5433,Z,"Thirsting, thirsting,"
5434,Z,"Voiceless from chasteness of soul to ask you for love,"

5447,Z,"My days of labor closed, sitting out life’s decline,"
5448,Z,"Day by day did I look in my memory,"
5449,Z,"As one who gazes in an enchantress’ crystal globe,"

5451,Z,"As if in a pageant glassed by a shining dream,"
5452,Z,Move through the incredible sphere of time.
5453,Z,And I saw a man arise from the soil like a fabled giant
5454,Z,"And throw himself over a deathless destiny,"
5455,Z,"Master of great armies, head of the republic,"
5456,Z,Bringing together into a dithyramb of recreative song

5459,Z,Where imperishable shields and swords were beaten out

5461,Z,Look in the crystal!

5482,Z,"The years till a terror came in my heart at times,"
5483,Z,With the feeling that I had become eternal; at last
5484,Z,My hundredth year was reached! And still I lay
5485,Z,"Hearing the tick of the clock, and the low of cattle"
5486,Z,And the scream of a jay flying through falling leaves!
5487,Z,Day after day alone in a room of the house
5488,Z,Of a daughter-in-law stricken with age and gray.
5489,Z,"And by night, or looking out of the window by day"
5490,Z,"My thought ran back, it seemed, through infinite time"
5491,Z,"To North Carolina and all my girlhood days,"
5492,Z,"And John, my John, away to the war with the British,"

5500,Z,"Why, when I lay so helpless in bed for years,"
5501,Z,"Praying for you to come, was your coming delayed?"
5502,Z,"Seeing that with a cry of rapture, like that I uttered"
5503,Z,"When you found me in old Virginia after the war,"

5517,Z,Some one who was in being
5518,Z,When giant hands from the womb of the world
5519,Z,Tore the republic.
5520,Z,What was it in their eyes?—
5521,Z,For I could never fathom
5522,Z,"That mystical pathos of drooped eyelids,"

5524,Z,"It was like a pool of water,"
5525,Z,"Amid oak trees at the edge of a forest,"

5533,Z,"Truly did my camera record their faces, too,"
5534,Z,"With so much of the old strength gone,"
5535,Z,"And the old faith gone,"
5536,Z,"And the old mastery of life gone,"
5537,Z,"And the old courage gone,"

5554,Z,I was more than an hour finding the White House.
5555,Z,"And when I found it they turned me away,"
5556,Z,Hiding their smiles.
5557,Z,"Then I thought: “Oh, well, he ain’t the same as when I boarded him"
5558,Z,And he and my husband worked together
5559,Z,"And all of us called him Abe, there in Menard.”"
5560,Z,As a last attempt I turned to a guard and said:
5561,Z,“Please say it’s old Aunt Hannah Armstrong
5562,Z,"From Illinois, come to see him about her sick boy"
5563,Z,In the army.”
5564,Z,"Well, just in a moment they let me in!"
5565,Z,"And when he saw me he broke in a laugh,"
5566,Z,"And dropped his business as president,"
5567,Z,"And wrote in his own hand Doug’s discharge,"
5568,Z,"Talking the while of the early days,"
5569,Z,And telling stories.

5583,Z,"Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,"
5584,Z,Eight of whom we lost
5585,Z,Ere I had reached the age of sixty.
5586,Z,"I spun,"

5588,Z,"I kept the house,"
5589,Z,"I nursed the sick,"
5590,Z,"I made the garden, and for holiday"
5591,Z,"Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,"

5710,Z,Of dancing water under a torrent of light;
5711,Z,And the purer part of the genius of Jean Rousseau
5712,Z,Was the silent music of all we saw or heard—
5713,Z,"There at Geneva, I say, was the rapture less"

6051,Z,
6052,Z,
6053,Z,Ye young debaters over the doctrine
6054,Z,Of the soul’s immortality
6055,Z,"I who lie here was the village atheist,"
6056,Z,"Talkative, contentious, versed in the arguments"
6057,Z,Of the infidels. But through a long sickness
6058,Z,Coughing myself to death I read the
6059,Z,Upanishads and the poetry of Jesus.
6060,Z,And they lighted a torch of hope and intuition
6061,Z,And desire which the Shadow
6062,Z,"Leading me swiftly through the caverns of darkness,"
6063,Z,Could not extinguish.
6064,Z,"Listen to me, ye who live in the senses"
6065,Z,And think through the senses only:
6066,Z,"Immortality is not a gift,"
6067,Z,Immortality is an achievement;
6068,Z,And only those who strive mightily
6069,Z,Shall possess it.

6077,Z,In the lust of my strength
6078,Z,"I cursed God, but he paid no attention to me:"
6079,Z,I might as well have cursed the stars.
6080,Z,"In my last sickness I was in agony, but I was resolute"
6081,Z,And I cursed God for my suffering;
6082,Z,Still He paid no attention to me;
6083,Z,"He left me alone, as He had always done."
6084,Z,I might as well have cursed the Presbyterian steeple.
6085,Z,"Then, as I grew weaker, a terror came over me:"
6086,Z,Perhaps I had alienated God by cursing him.
6087,Z,One day Lydia Humphrey brought me a bouquet
6088,Z,"And it occurred to me to try to make friends with God,"
6089,Z,So I tried to make friends with Him;
6090,Z,But I might as well have tried to make friends with the bouquet.
6091,Z,"Now I was very close to the secret,"
6092,Z,For I really could make friends with the bouquet
6093,Z,By holding close to me the love in me for the bouquet
6094,Z,"And so I was creeping upon the secret, but—"

6104,Z,The justice of others injustice to me;
6105,Z,"Their reasons for death, reasons with me for life;"
6106,Z,"Their reasons for life, reasons with me for death;"
6107,Z,"I would have killed those they saved,"
6108,Z,And save those they killed.
6109,Z,"And I saw how a god, if brought to earth,"
6110,Z,"Must act out what he saw and thought,"
6111,Z,And could not live in this world of men
6112,Z,And act among them side by side
6113,Z,Without continual clashes.

6127,Z,"They jeered when I spoke of the lunar mountains,"
6128,Z,"And the thrilling heat and cold,"
6129,Z,"And the ebon valleys by silver peaks,"
6130,Z,"And Spica quadrillions of miles away,"
6131,Z,And the littleness of man.
6132,Z,"But now that my grave is honored, friends,"
6133,Z,Let it not be because I taught
6134,Z,"The lore of the stars in Knox College,"
6135,Z,But rather for this: that through the stars
6136,Z,"I preached the greatness of man,"
6137,Z,Who is none the less a part of the scheme of things
6138,Z,For the distance of Spica or the Spiral Nebulae;

6148,Z,At four o’clock in late October
6149,Z,I sat alone in the country school-house
6150,Z,"Back from the road, mid stricken fields,"
6151,Z,"And an eddy of wind blew leaves on the pane,"
6152,Z,"And crooned in the flue of the cannon-stove,"
6153,Z,With its open door blurring the shadows
6154,Z,With the spectral glow of a dying fire.
6155,Z,In an idle mood I was running the planchette—
6156,Z,"All at once my wrist grew limp,"
6157,Z,"And my hand moved rapidly over the board,"
6158,Z,"’Till the name of “Charles Guiteau” was spelled,"
6159,Z,Who threatened to materialize before me.
6160,Z,I rose and fled from the room bare-headed
6161,Z,"Into the dusk, afraid of my gift."
6162,Z,And after that the spirits swarmed—
6163,Z,"Chaucer, Caesar, Poe and Marlowe,"
6164,Z,Cleopatra and Mrs. Surratt—
6165,Z,"Wherever I went, with messages,—"
6166,Z,"Mere trifling twaddle, Spoon River agreed."
6167,Z,"You talk nonsense to children, don’t you?"
6168,Z,And suppose I see what you never saw
6169,Z,"And never heard of and have no word for,"

6182,Z,Take its meaning to heart:
6183,Z,"You too may walk, after the hills at Miller’s Ford"
6184,Z,Seem no longer far away;
6185,Z,"Long after you see them near at hand,"
6186,Z,Beyond four miles of meadow;
6187,Z,And after woman’s love is silent
6188,Z,Saying no more: “I will save you.”
6189,Z,And after the faces of friends and kindred
6190,Z,"Become as faded photographs, pitifully silent,"
6191,Z,Sad for the look which means:
6192,Z,“We cannot help you.”
6193,Z,And after you no longer reproach mankind
6194,Z,With being in league against your soul’s uplifted hands—
6195,Z,Themselves compelled at midnight and at noon
6196,Z,To watch with steadfast eye their destinies;
6197,Z,"After you have these understandings, think of me"

6199,Z,"That neither man nor woman, neither toil,"

6217,Z,"I knew of the eagle souls that flew high in the sunlight,"
6218,Z,"Above the spire of the church, and laughed at the church,"

6240,Z,"And knew you all through, and loved you ever,"

6259,Z,As if after-while to be transplanted

6261,Z,And I was disembodied vision

6355,Z,With my face growing clearer to you as yours
6356,Z,Grew clearer to me.

6371,Z,"Oh well! A harp leaps out of the ear of a man, you say,"
6372,Z,But whence the ear that orders the length of the strings
6373,Z,To a magic of numbers flying before your thought

6375,Z,"Is there no Ear round the ear of a man, that it senses"

6415,Z,"With its ruined trunk and blasted branches,"
6416,Z,And shoots of green whose delicate blossoms
6417,Z,"Were sprinkled over the skeleton tangle,"
6418,Z,Never to grow in fruit.

6420,Z,"By the flesh half dead, the senses numb"

6441,Z,Speaking in broken voice of the peasant youth
6442,Z,Of Galilee who went to the city
6443,Z,And was killed by bankers and lawyers;
6444,Z,My voice mingling with the June wind
6445,Z,That blew over wheat fields from Atterbury;
6446,Z,While the white stones in the burying ground
6447,Z,Around the Church shimmered in the summer sun.
6448,Z,"And there, though my own memories"
6449,Z,"Were too great to bear, were you, O pioneers,"

6454,Z,"But in those moments of tragic silence,"

6473,Z,"O world, that’s you!"
6474,Z,You are but a widened place in the river

6476,Z,"Mirrored in us, and so we dream"

6478,Z,"We look for the face, behold the low-lands"

6480,Z,Into the larger stream!
6481,Z,But here by the mill the castled clouds
6482,Z,Mocked themselves in the dizzy water;
6483,Z,And over its agate floor at night
6484,Z,The flame of the moon ran under my eyes
6485,Z,Amid a forest stillness broken
6486,Z,By a flute in a hut on the hill.
6487,Z,At last when I came to lie in bed
6488,Z,"Weak and in pain, with the dreams about me,"

6491,Z,So swiftly it seemed to be at rest
6492,Z,Under cities of cloud and under

6494,Z,Until I saw a flash of trumpets

6505,Z,"A breeze blew out of the east and swept them as leaves,"
6506,Z,Driving some up the slopes. . . .
6507,Z,All was changed.
6508,Z,"Here were flying lights, and mystic moons, and dream-music."
6509,Z,A cloud fell upon us.
6510,Z,When it lifted all was changed.
6511,Z,I was now amid multitudes who were wrangling.
6512,Z,"Then a figure in shimmering gold, and one with a trumpet,"
6513,Z,And one with a sceptre stood before me.
6514,Z,They mocked me and danced a rigadoon and vanished. . . .
6515,Z,All was changed again.
6516,Z,Out of a bower of poppies
6517,Z,A woman bared her breasts and lifted her open mouth to mine.
6518,Z,I kissed her.
6519,Z,The taste of her lips was like salt.
6520,Z,She left blood on my lips.
6521,Z,I fell exhausted.
6522,Z,"I arose and ascended higher, but a mist as from an iceberg"
6523,Z,Clouded my steps.
6524,Z,I was cold and in pain.
6525,Z,"Then the sun streamed on me again,"
6526,Z,And I saw the mists below me hiding all below them.
6527,Z,"And I, bent over my staff, knew myself"
6528,Z,Silhouetted against the snow. And above me
6529,Z,"Was the soundless air, pierced by a cone of ice,"
6530,Z,Over which hung a solitary star!
6531,Z,"A shudder of ecstasy, a shudder of fear"
6532,Z,Ran through me.
6533,Z,But I could not return to the slopes—
6534,Z,"Nay, I wished not to return."
6535,Z,For the spent waves of the symphony of freedom
6536,Z,Lapped the ethereal cliffs about me.
6537,Z,Therefore I climbed to the pinnacle.
6538,Z,I flung away my staff.
6539,Z,I touched that star
6540,Z,With my outstretched hand.
6541,Z,I vanished utterly.
6542,Z,For the mountain delivers to Infinite Truth
6543,Z,Whosoever touches the star.

6551,Z,"Do you remember, O Delphic Apollo,"
6552,Z,"The sunset hour by the river, when Mickey M’Grew"
6553,Z,"Cried, “There’s a ghost,” and I, “It’s Delphic Apollo”;"
6554,Z,"And the son of the banker derided us, saying, “It’s light"
6555,Z,"By the flags at the water’s edge, you half-witted fools.”"
6556,Z,"And from thence, as the wearisome years rolled on, long after"
6557,Z,Poor Mickey fell down in the water tower to his death
6558,Z,"Down, down, through bellowing darkness, I carried"
6559,Z,The vision which perished with him like a rocket which falls
6560,Z,"And quenches its light in earth, and hid it for fear"
6561,Z,"Of the son of the banker, calling on Plutus to save me?"
6562,Z,Avenged were you for the shame of a fearful heart
6563,Z,Who left me alone till I saw you again in an hour
6564,Z,When I seemed to be turned to a tree with trunk and branches
6565,Z,"Growing indurate, turning to stone, yet burgeoning"
6566,Z,"In laurel leaves, in hosts of lambent laurel,"
6567,Z,"Quivering, fluttering, shrinking, fighting the numbness"
6568,Z,Creeping into their veins from the dying trunk and branches!
6569,Z,"’Tis vain, O youth, to fly the call of Apollo."
6570,Z,"Fling yourselves in the fire, die with a song of spring,"
6571,Z,If die you must in the spring. For none shall look
6572,Z,"On the face of Apollo and live, and choose you must"
6573,Z,"’Twixt death in the flame and death after years of sorrow,"
6574,Z,"Rooted fast in the earth, feeling the grisly hand,"
6575,Z,Not so much in the trunk as in the terrible numbness
6576,Z,Creeping up to the laurel leaves that never cease
6577,Z,To flourish until you fall. O leaves of me
6578,Z,"Too sere for coronal wreaths, and fit alone"
6579,Z,"For urns of memory, treasured, perhaps, as themes"
6580,Z,"For hearts heroic, fearless singers and livers—"

6590,Z,"111), planned The Spooniad as an epic in twenty-four books, but"
6591,Z,unfortunately did not live to complete even the first book. The
6592,Z,fragment was found among his papers by William Marion Reedy and was for
6593,Z,"the first time published in Reedy’s Mirror of December 18th, 1914._]"
6594,Z,
6595,Z,
6596,Z,Of John Cabanis’ wrath and of the strife
6597,Z,"Of hostile parties, and his dire defeat"
6598,Z,Who led the common people in the cause
6599,Z,"Of freedom for Spoon River, and the fall"
6600,Z,"Of Rhodes, bank that brought unnumbered woes"
6601,Z,"And loss to many, with engendered hate"
6602,Z,That flamed into the torch in Anarch hands
6603,Z,"To burn the court-house, on whose blackened wreck"
6604,Z,A fairer temple rose and Progress stood—
6605,Z,"Sing, muse, that lit the Chian’s face with smiles"
6606,Z,Who saw the ant-like Greeks and Trojans crawl
6607,Z,"About Scamander, over walls, pursued"
6608,Z,"Or else pursuing, and the funeral pyres"
6609,Z,"And sacred hecatombs, and first because"
6610,Z,Of Helen who with Paris fled to Troy
6611,Z,"As soul-mate; and the wrath of Peleus, son,"
6612,Z,"Decreed to lose Chryseis, lovely spoil"
6613,Z,"Of war, and dearest concubine."
6614,Z,
6615,Z,"Say first,"
6616,Z,"Thou son of night, called Momus, from whose eyes"
6617,Z,"No secret hides, and Thalia, smiling one,"
6618,Z,What bred ’twixt Thomas Rhodes and John Cabanis
6619,Z,"The deadly strife? His daughter Flossie, she,"
6620,Z,Returning from her wandering with a troop
6621,Z,"Of strolling players, walked the village streets,"
6622,Z,Her bracelets tinkling and with sparkling rings
6623,Z,And words of serpent wisdom and a smile
6624,Z,"Of cunning in her eyes. Then Thomas Rhodes,"
6625,Z,"Who ruled the church and ruled the bank as well,"
6626,Z,Made known his disapproval of the maid;
6627,Z,And all Spoon River whispered and the eyes
6628,Z,"Of all the church frowned on her, till she knew"
6629,Z,They feared her and condemned.
6630,Z,
6631,Z,But them to flout
6632,Z,"She gave a dance to viols and to flutes,"
6633,Z,"Brought from Peoria, and many youths,"
6634,Z,But lately made regenerate through the prayers
6635,Z,"Of zealous preachers and of earnest souls,"
6636,Z,"Danced merrily, and sought her in the dance,"
6637,Z,Who wore a dress so low of neck that eyes
6638,Z,Down straying might survey the snowy swale
6639,Z,’Till it was lost in whiteness.
6640,Z,
6641,Z,With the dance
6642,Z,The village changed to merriment from gloom.
6643,Z,"The milliner, Mrs. Williams, could not fill"
6644,Z,"Her orders for new hats, and every seamstress"
6645,Z,Plied busy needles making gowns; old trunks
6646,Z,And chests were opened for their store of laces
6647,Z,And rings and trinkets were brought out of hiding
6648,Z,And all the youths fastidious grew of dress;
6649,Z,"Notes passed, and many a fair one’s door at eve"
6650,Z,"Knew a bouquet, and strolling lovers thronged"
6651,Z,About the hills that overlooked the river.
6652,Z,"Then, since the mercy seats more empty showed,"
6653,Z,One of God’s chosen lifted up his voice:
6654,Z,“The woman of Babylon is among us; rise
6655,Z,Ye sons of light and drive the wanton forth!”
6656,Z,So John Cabanis left the church and left
6657,Z,The hosts of law and order with his eyes
6658,Z,"By anger cleared, and him the liberal cause"
6659,Z,Acclaimed as nominee to the mayoralty
6660,Z,To vanquish A. D. Blood.
6661,Z,
6662,Z,But as the war
6663,Z,Waged bitterly for votes and rumors flew
6664,Z,"About the bank, and of the heavy loans"
6665,Z,"Which Rhodes, son had made to prop his loss"
6666,Z,"In wheat, and many drew their coin and left"
6667,Z,"The bank of Rhodes more hollow, with the talk"
6668,Z,Among the liberals of another bank
6669,Z,"Soon to be chartered, lo, the bubble burst"
6670,Z,’Mid cries and curses; but the liberals laughed
6671,Z,And in the hall of Nicholas Bindle held
6672,Z,Wise converse and inspiriting debate.
6673,Z,
6674,Z,High on a stage that overlooked the chairs
6675,Z,"Where dozens sat, and where a pop-eyed daub"
6676,Z,"Of Shakespeare, very like the hired man"
6677,Z,"Of Christian Dallman, brow and pointed beard,"
6678,Z,"Upon a drab proscenium outward stared,"
6679,Z,"Sat Harmon Whitney, to that eminence,"
6680,Z,"By merit raised in ribaldry and guile,"
6681,Z,And to the assembled rebels thus he spake:
6682,Z,“Whether to lie supine and let a clique
6683,Z,"Cold-blooded, scheming, hungry, singing psalms,"
6684,Z,"Devour our substance, wreck our banks and drain"
6685,Z,Our little hoards for hazards on the price
6686,Z,"Of wheat or pork, or yet to cower beneath"
6687,Z,The shadow of a spire upreared to curb
6688,Z,A breed of lackeys and to serve the bank
6689,Z,"Coadjutor in greed, that is the question."
6690,Z,"Shall we have music and the jocund dance,"
6691,Z,Or tolling bells? Or shall young romance roam
6692,Z,"These hills about the river, flowering now"
6693,Z,"To April’s tears, or shall they sit at home,"
6694,Z,"Or play croquet where Thomas Rhodes may see,"
6695,Z,I ask you? If the blood of youth runs o’er
6696,Z,"And riots ’gainst this regimen of gloom,"
6697,Z,Shall we submit to have these youths and maids
6698,Z,Branded as libertines and wantons?”
6699,Z,
6700,Z,Ere
6701,Z,His words were done a woman’s voice called “No!”
6702,Z,"Then rose a sound of moving chairs, as when"
6703,Z,The numerous swine o’er-run the replenished troughs;
6704,Z,"And every head was turned, as when a flock"
6705,Z,Of geese back-turning to the hunter’s tread
6706,Z,Rise up with flapping wings; then rang the hall
6707,Z,"With riotous laughter, for with battered hat"
6708,Z,"Tilted upon her saucy head, and fist"
6709,Z,"Raised in defiance, Daisy Fraser stood."
6710,Z,Headlong she had been hurled from out the hall
6711,Z,"Save Wendell Bloyd, who spoke for woman’s rights,"
6712,Z,"Prevented, and the bellowing voice of Burchard."
6713,Z,"Then, mid applause she hastened toward the stage"
6714,Z,And flung both gold and silver to the cause
6715,Z,And swiftly left the hall.
6716,Z,Meantime upstood
6717,Z,"A giant figure, bearded like the son"
6718,Z,"Of Alcmene, deep-chested, round of paunch,"
6719,Z,And spoke in thunder: “Over there behold
6720,Z,A man who for the truth withstood his wife—
6721,Z,Such is our spirit—when that A. D. Blood
6722,Z,Compelled me to remove Dom Pedro—”
6723,Z,
6724,Z,Quick
6725,Z,"Before Jim Brown could finish, Jefferson Howard"
6726,Z,Obtained the floor and spake: “Ill suits the time
6727,Z,"For clownish words, and trivial is our cause"
6728,Z,"If naught’s at stake but John Cabanis, wrath,"
6729,Z,He who was erstwhile of the other side
6730,Z,And came to us for vengeance. More’s at stake
6731,Z,Than triumph for New England or Virginia.
6732,Z,"And whether rum be sold, or for two years"
6733,Z,"As in the past two years, this town be dry"
6734,Z,"Matters but little— Oh yes, revenue"
6735,Z,"For sidewalks, sewers; that is well enough!"
6736,Z,I wish to God this fight were now inspired
6737,Z,By other passion than to salve the pride
6738,Z,Of John Cabanis or his daughter. Why
6739,Z,Can never contests of great moment spring
6740,Z,"From worthy things, not little? Still, if men"
6741,Z,"Must always act so, and if rum must be"
6742,Z,The symbol and the medium to release
6743,Z,"From life’s denial and from slavery,"
6744,Z,Then give me rum!”
6745,Z,
6746,Z,Exultant cries arose.
6747,Z,"Then, as George Trimble had o’ercome his fear"
6748,Z,"And vacillation and begun to speak,"
6749,Z,"The door creaked and the idiot, Willie Metcalf,"
6750,Z,"Breathless and hatless, whiter than a sheet,"
6751,Z,Entered and cried: “The marshal’s on his way
6752,Z,To arrest you all. And if you only knew
6753,Z,Who’s coming here to-morrow; I was listening
6754,Z,Beneath the window where the other side
6755,Z,Are making plans.”
6756,Z,
6757,Z,So to a smaller room
6758,Z,To hear the idiot’s secret some withdrew
6759,Z,Selected by the Chair; the Chair himself
6760,Z,"And Jefferson Howard, Benjamin Pantier,"
6761,Z,"And Wendell Bloyd, George Trimble, Adam Weirauch,"
6762,Z,"Imanuel Ehrenhardt, Seth Compton, Godwin James"
6763,Z,"And Enoch Dunlap, Hiram Scates, Roy Butler,"
6764,Z,"Carl Hamblin, Roger Heston, Ernest Hyde"
6765,Z,"And Penniwit, the artist, Kinsey Keene,"
6766,Z,"And E. C. Culbertson and Franklin Jones,"
6767,Z,"Benjamin Fraser, son of Benjamin Pantier"
6768,Z,"By Daisy Fraser, some of lesser note,"
6769,Z,And secretly conferred.
6770,Z,
6771,Z,But in the hall
6772,Z,Disorder reigned and when the marshal came
6773,Z,"And found it so, he marched the hoodlums out"
6774,Z,And locked them up.
6775,Z,
6776,Z,Meanwhile within a room
6777,Z,"Back in the basement of the church, with Blood"
6778,Z,"Counseled the wisest heads. Judge Somers first,"
6779,Z,"Deep learned in life, and next him, Elliott Hawkins"
6780,Z,And Lambert Hutchins; next him Thomas Rhodes
6781,Z,"And Editor Whedon; next him Garrison Standard,"
6782,Z,"A traitor to the liberals, who with lip"
6783,Z,Upcurled in scorn and with a bitter sneer:
6784,Z,“Such strife about an insult to a woman—
6785,Z,"A girl of eighteen” —Christian Dallman too,"
6786,Z,And others unrecorded. Some there were
6787,Z,Who frowned not on the cup but loathed the rule
6788,Z,"Democracy achieved thereby, the freedom"
6789,Z,And lust of life it symbolized.
6790,Z,
6791,Z,Now morn with snowy fingers up the sky
6792,Z,Flung like an orange at a festival
6793,Z,"The ruddy sun, when from their hasty beds"
6794,Z,"Poured forth the hostile forces, and the streets"
6795,Z,Resounded to the rattle of the wheels
6796,Z,That drove this way and that to gather in
6797,Z,"The tardy voters, and the cries of chieftains"
6798,Z,Who manned the battle. But at ten o’clock
6799,Z,"The liberals bellowed fraud, and at the polls"
6800,Z,The rival candidates growled and came to blows.
6801,Z,Then proved the idiot’s tale of yester-eve
6802,Z,A word of warning. Suddenly on the streets
6803,Z,"Walked hog-eyed Allen, terror of the hills"
6804,Z,That looked on Bernadotte ten miles removed.
6805,Z,No man of this degenerate day could lift
6806,Z,"The boulders which he threw, and when he spoke"
6807,Z,"The windows rattled, and beneath his brows"
6808,Z,"Thatched like a shed with bristling hair of black,"
6809,Z,His small eyes glistened like a maddened boar.
6810,Z,"And as he walked the boards creaked, as he walked"
6811,Z,"A song of menace rumbled. Thus he came,"
6812,Z,"The champion of A. D. Blood, commissioned"
6813,Z,To terrify the liberals. Many fled
6814,Z,As when a hawk soars o’er the chicken yard.
6815,Z,He passed the polls and with a playful hand
6816,Z,"Touched Brown, the giant, and he fell against,"
6817,Z,"As though he were a child, the wall; so strong"
6818,Z,Was hog-eyed Allen. But the liberals smiled.
6819,Z,"For soon as hog-eyed Allen reached the walk,"
6820,Z,"Close on his steps paced Bengal Mike, brought in"
6821,Z,"By Kinsey Keene, the subtle-witted one,"
6822,Z,To match the hog-eyed Allen. He was scarce
6823,Z,"Three-fourths the other’s bulk, but steel his arms,"
6824,Z,And with a tiger’s heart. Two men he killed
6825,Z,"And many wounded in the days before,"
6826,Z,And no one feared.
6827,Z,
6828,Z,But when the hog-eyed one
6829,Z,"Saw Bengal Mike his countenance grew dark,"
6830,Z,"The bristles o’er his red eyes twitched with rage,"
6831,Z,The song he rumbled lowered. Round and round
6832,Z,"The court-house paced he, followed stealthily"
6833,Z,"By Bengal Mike, who jeered him every step:"
6834,Z,"“Come, elephant, and fight! Come, hog-eyed coward!"
6835,Z,"Come, face about and fight me, lumbering sneak!"
6836,Z,"Come, beefy bully, hit me, if you can!"
6837,Z,"Take out your gun, you duffer, give me reason"
6838,Z,To draw and kill you. Take your billy out.
6839,Z,I’ll crack your boar’s head with a piece of brick!”
6840,Z,But never a word the hog-eyed one returned
6841,Z,"But trod about the court-house, followed both"
6842,Z,By troops of boys and watched by all the men.
6843,Z,"All day, they walked the square. But when Apollo"
6844,Z,Stood with reluctant look above the hills
6845,Z,"As fain to see the end, and all the votes"
6846,Z,"Were cast, and closed the polls, before the door"
6847,Z,"Of Trainor’s drug store Bengal Mike, in tones"
6848,Z,"That echoed through the village, bawled the taunt:"
6849,Z,"“Who was your mother, hog—eyed?” In a trice"
6850,Z,As when a wild boar turns upon the hound
6851,Z,That through the brakes upon an August day
6852,Z,"Has gashed him with its teeth, the hog-eyed one"
6853,Z,Rushed with his giant arms on Bengal Mike
6854,Z,And grabbed him by the throat. Then rose to heaven
6855,Z,"The frightened cries of boys, and yells of men"
6856,Z,Forth rushing to the street. And Bengal Mike
6857,Z,"Moved this way and now that, drew in his head"
6858,Z,"As if his neck to shorten, and bent down"
6859,Z,To break the death grip of the hog-eyed one;
6860,Z,’Twixt guttural wrath and fast-expiring strength
6861,Z,Striking his fists against the invulnerable chest
6862,Z,"Of hog-eyed Allen. Then, when some came in"
6863,Z,"To part them, others stayed them, and the fight"
6864,Z,Spread among dozens; many valiant souls
6865,Z,Went down from clubs and bricks.
6866,Z,
6867,Z,"But tell me, Muse,"
6868,Z,What god or goddess rescued Bengal Mike?
6869,Z,"With one last, mighty struggle did he grasp"
6870,Z,The murderous hands and turning kick his foe.
6871,Z,"Then, as if struck by lightning, vanished all"
6872,Z,"The strength from hog-eyed Allen, at his side"
6873,Z,Sank limp those giant arms and o’er his face
6874,Z,Dread pallor and the sweat of anguish spread.
6875,Z,"And those great knees, invincible but late,"
6876,Z,Shook to his weight. And quickly as the lion
6877,Z,"Leaps on its wounded prey, did Bengal Mike"
6878,Z,"Smite with a rock the temple of his foe,"
6879,Z,And down he sank and darkness o’er his eyes
6880,Z,Passed like a cloud.
6881,Z,
6882,Z,As when the woodman fells
6883,Z,Some giant oak upon a summer’s day
6884,Z,"And all the songsters of the forest shrill,"
6885,Z,And one great hawk that has his nestling young
6886,Z,"Amid the topmost branches croaks, as crash"
6887,Z,The leafy branches through the tangled boughs
6888,Z,"Of brother oaks, so fell the hog-eyed one"
6889,Z,Amid the lamentations of the friends
6890,Z,Of A. D. Blood.
6891,Z,
6892,Z,"Just then, four lusty men"
6893,Z,"Bore the town marshal, on whose iron face"
6894,Z,"The purple pall of death already lay,"
6895,Z,"To Trainor’s drug store, shot by Jack McGuire."
6896,Z,And cries went up of “Lynch him!” and the sound
6897,Z,Of running feet from every side was heard

7052,BEELZEBUB,
7053,YOGARINDRA,YOGARINDRA

7062,BEELZEBUB,BEELZEBUB

7094,BEELZEBUB,

7097,YOGARINDRA,
7098,BEELZEBUB,BEELZEBUB
7099,BEELZEBUB,I set me to it. Where is the clay?

7104,BEELZEBUB,"Out of the slime,"
7105,BEELZEBUB,"A little rust,"
7106,BEELZEBUB,And a little lime.
7107,BEELZEBUB,"Muscle and gristle,"
7108,BEELZEBUB,"Mucin, stone"
7109,BEELZEBUB,"Brayed with a pestle,"
7110,BEELZEBUB,Fat and bone.
7111,BEELZEBUB,"Out of the marshes,"
7112,BEELZEBUB,"Out of the vaults,"
7113,BEELZEBUB,Matter crushes
7114,BEELZEBUB,Gas and salts.
7115,BEELZEBUB,"What is this you call a mind,"
7116,BEELZEBUB,"Flitting, drifting, pale and blind,"
7117,BEELZEBUB,Soul of the swamp that rides the wind?
7118,BEELZEBUB,"Jack-o’-lantern, here you are!"
7119,BEELZEBUB,"Dream of heaven, pine for a star,"
7120,BEELZEBUB,"Chase your brothers to and fro,"
7121,BEELZEBUB,Back to the swamp at last you’ll go.

7129,BEELZEBUB,"Old one, old one."
7130,BEELZEBUB,Now ere I break you
7131,BEELZEBUB,Crush you and make you
7132,BEELZEBUB,"Clay for my use,"
7133,BEELZEBUB,Let me observe you:
7134,BEELZEBUB,You were a bold one
7135,BEELZEBUB,"Flat at the dome of you,"
7136,BEELZEBUB,"Heavy the base of you,"
7137,BEELZEBUB,"False to the home of you,"
7138,BEELZEBUB,"Strong was the face of you,"
7139,BEELZEBUB,Strange to all fears.
7140,BEELZEBUB,Yet did the hair of you
7141,BEELZEBUB,Hide what you were.
7142,BEELZEBUB,Now to re-nerve you—
7143,BEELZEBUB,
7144,BEELZEBUB,(_He crushes the skull between his hands and mixes it with the clay._)
7145,BEELZEBUB,
7146,BEELZEBUB,
7147,BEELZEBUB,"Now you are dust,"
7148,BEELZEBUB,Limestone and rust.
7149,BEELZEBUB,I mold and I stir
7150,BEELZEBUB,And make you again.
7151,BEELZEBUB,
7152,THE VALLEY,THE VALLEY

7154,THE VALLEY,
7155,THE VALLEY,"(_In the same manner_ BEELZEBUB _has fashioned several figures,"

7157,THE VALLEY,

7159,LOKI,LOKI
7160,LOKI,Now for the breath of life. As I remember
7161,LOKI,"You have done right to mold your creatures first,"
7162,LOKI,And stand them up.

7164,BEELZEBUB,BEELZEBUB
7165,BEELZEBUB,From gravitation
7166,BEELZEBUB,I make the will.

7168,YOGARINDRA,YOGARINDRA
7169,YOGARINDRA,Out of sensation
7170,YOGARINDRA,Comes his ill.
7171,YOGARINDRA,Out of my mirror
7172,YOGARINDRA,Springs his error.
7173,YOGARINDRA,Who was so cruel
7174,YOGARINDRA,To make him the slave
7175,YOGARINDRA,"Of me the sorceress, you the knave,"
7176,YOGARINDRA,"And you the plotter to catch his thought,"
7177,YOGARINDRA,"Whatever he did, whatever he sought?"
7178,YOGARINDRA,With a nature dual
7179,YOGARINDRA,"Of will and mind,"
7180,YOGARINDRA,"A thing that sees, and a thing that’s blind."
7181,YOGARINDRA,Come! to our dance! Something hated him
7182,YOGARINDRA,"Made us over him, therefore fated him."
7183,YOGARINDRA,

7188,LOKI,"Passion, reason, custom, ruels,"

7191,LOKI,Flesh too weak for the will’s control;
7192,LOKI,"Poverty, riches, pride of birth,"
7193,LOKI,"Wailing, laughter, over the earth."
7194,LOKI,Here I have you caught again.
7195,LOKI,"Enter my web, ye sons of men."
7196,LOKI,
7197,YOGARINDRA,YOGARINDRA
7198,YOGARINDRA,Look in my mirror! Isn’t it real?
7199,YOGARINDRA,"What do you think now, what do you feel?"
7200,YOGARINDRA,Here is treasure of gold heaped up;
7201,YOGARINDRA,Here is wine in the festal cup.
7202,YOGARINDRA,"Tendrils blossoming, turned to whips,"
7203,YOGARINDRA,Love with her breasts and scarlet lips.
7204,YOGARINDRA,Breathe in their nostrils.

7207,BEELZEBUB,"Falsehood’s breath,"

7210,BEELZEBUB,"Wonder, mockery, paradox!"
7211,BEELZEBUB,"Soaring spirit, groveling flesh,"
7212,BEELZEBUB,"Bait the trap, and spread the mesh."
7213,BEELZEBUB,"Give him hunger, lure him with truth,"
7214,BEELZEBUB,Give him the iris hopes of Youth.
7215,BEELZEBUB,"Starve him, shame him, fling him down,"
7216,BEELZEBUB,Whirled in the vortex of the town.
7217,BEELZEBUB,"Break him, age him, till he curse"
7218,BEELZEBUB,The idiot face of the universe.

7268,YOGARINDRA,"Oh, yes, a play! That’s very well, I think,"
7269,YOGARINDRA,But who will be the audience? I must throw
7270,YOGARINDRA,Illusion over all.
7271,YOGARINDRA,
7272,LOKI,LOKI
7273,LOKI,And I must shift

7312,BEELZEBUB,BEELZEBUB
7313,BEELZEBUB,"Ladies and gentlemen, your kind attention"
7314,BEELZEBUB,To my interpretation of the scene.
7315,BEELZEBUB,"I rise to give your fancy comprehension,"
7316,BEELZEBUB,And analyze the parts of the machine.
7317,BEELZEBUB,"My mood is such that I would not deceive you,"
7318,BEELZEBUB,"Though still a liar and the father of it,"
7319,BEELZEBUB,"From judgment’s frailty I would retrieve you,"
7320,BEELZEBUB,Though falsehood is my art and though I love it.
7321,BEELZEBUB,"Down in the habitations whence I rise,"
7322,BEELZEBUB,The roots of human sorrow boundless spread.
7323,BEELZEBUB,Long have I watched them draw the strength that lies
7324,BEELZEBUB,In clay made richer by the rotting dead.
7325,BEELZEBUB,"Here is a blossom, here a twisted stalk,"
7326,BEELZEBUB,Here fruit that sourly withers ere its prime;
7327,BEELZEBUB,"And here a growth that sprawls across the walk,"
7328,BEELZEBUB,"Food for the green worm, which it turns to slime."
7329,BEELZEBUB,The ruddy apple with a core of cork
7330,BEELZEBUB,"Springs from a root which in a hollow dangles,"
7331,BEELZEBUB,Not skillful husbandry nor laborious work
7332,BEELZEBUB,Can save the tree which lightning breaks and tangles.
7333,BEELZEBUB,Why does the bright nasturtium scarcely flower
7334,BEELZEBUB,"But that those insects multiply and grow,"
7335,BEELZEBUB,"Which make it food, and in the very hour"
7336,BEELZEBUB,In which the veined leaves and blossoms blow?
7337,BEELZEBUB,"Why does a goodly tree, while fast maturing,"
7338,BEELZEBUB,Turn crooked branches covered o’er with scale?
7339,BEELZEBUB,Why does the tree whose youth was not assuring
7340,BEELZEBUB,Prosper and bear while all its fellows fail?
7341,BEELZEBUB,I under earth see much. I know the soil.
7342,BEELZEBUB,I know where mold is heavy and where thin.
7343,BEELZEBUB,"I see the stones that thwart the plowman’s toil,"
7344,BEELZEBUB,The crooked roots of what the priests call sin.
7345,BEELZEBUB,"I know all secrets, even to the core,"
7346,BEELZEBUB,"What seedlings will be upas, pine or laurel;"
7347,BEELZEBUB,It cannot change howe’er the field’s worked o’er.
7348,BEELZEBUB,Man’s what he is and that’s the devil’s moral.
7349,BEELZEBUB,So with the souls of the ensuing drama
7350,BEELZEBUB,They sprang from certain seed in certain earth.
7351,BEELZEBUB,"Behold them in the devil’s cyclorama,"
7352,BEELZEBUB,Shown in their proper light for all they’re worth.
7353,BEELZEBUB,Now to my task: I’ll give an exhibition
7354,BEELZEBUB,Of mixing the ingredients of spirit.
7355,BEELZEBUB,
7356,BEELZEBUB,(_He waves his hand._)
7357,BEELZEBUB,
7358,BEELZEBUB,
7359,BEELZEBUB,"Come, crucible, perform your magic mission,"
7360,BEELZEBUB,"Come, recreative fire, and hover near it!"
7361,BEELZEBUB,"I’ll make a soul, or show how one is made."
7362,BEELZEBUB,
7363,BEELZEBUB,(_He waves his wand again. Parti-colored flames appear._)
7364,BEELZEBUB,
7365,BEELZEBUB,
7366,BEELZEBUB,This is the woman you shall see anon!
7367,BEELZEBUB,
7368,BEELZEBUB,(_A red flame appears._)
7369,BEELZEBUB,
7370,BEELZEBUB,
7371,BEELZEBUB,This hectic flame makes all the world afraid:
7372,BEELZEBUB,It was a soldier’s scourge which ate the bone.
7373,BEELZEBUB,His daughter bore the lady of the action.
7374,BEELZEBUB,And died at thirty-nine of scrofula.
7375,BEELZEBUB,"She was a creature of a sweet attraction,"
7376,BEELZEBUB,Whose sex-obsession no one ever saw.
7377,BEELZEBUB,
7378,BEELZEBUB,(_A purple flame appears._)
7379,BEELZEBUB,
7380,BEELZEBUB,
7381,BEELZEBUB,Lo! this denotes aristocratic strains
7382,BEELZEBUB,Back in the centuries of France’s glory.
7383,BEELZEBUB,
7384,BEELZEBUB,(_A blue flame appears._)
7385,BEELZEBUB,
7386,BEELZEBUB,
7387,BEELZEBUB,And this the will that pulls against the chains
7388,BEELZEBUB,Her father strove until his hair was hoary.
7389,BEELZEBUB,Sorrow and failure made his nature cold.
7390,BEELZEBUB,"He never loved the child whose woe is shown,"
7391,BEELZEBUB,And hence her passion for the things which gold
7392,BEELZEBUB,"Brings in this world of pride, and brings alone."
7393,BEELZEBUB,The human heart that’s famished from its birth
7394,BEELZEBUB,"Turns to the grosser treasures, that is plain."
7395,BEELZEBUB,Thus aspiration fallen fills the earth
7396,BEELZEBUB,With jungle growths of bitterness and pain.
7397,BEELZEBUB,"Of Celtic, Gallic fire our heroine!"
7398,BEELZEBUB,"Courageous, cruel, passionate and proud."
7399,BEELZEBUB,"False, vengeful, cunning, without fear o’ sin."
7400,BEELZEBUB,"A head that oft is bloody, but not bowed."
7401,BEELZEBUB,"Now if she meet a man—suppose our hero,"
7402,BEELZEBUB,"With whom her chemistry shall war yet mix,"
7403,BEELZEBUB,"As if she were her Borgia to his Nero,"
7404,BEELZEBUB,’Twill look like one of Satan’s little tricks!
7405,BEELZEBUB,"However, it must be. The world’s great garden"
7406,BEELZEBUB,Is not all mine. I only sow the tares.
7407,BEELZEBUB,"Wheat should be made immune, or else the Warden"
7408,BEELZEBUB,Should stop their coming in the world’s affairs.
7409,BEELZEBUB,But to our hero! Long ere he was born
7410,BEELZEBUB,I knew what would repel him and attract.
7411,BEELZEBUB,"Such spirit mathematics, fig or thorn,"
7412,BEELZEBUB,I can prognosticate before the fact.
7413,BEELZEBUB,
7414,BEELZEBUB,(_A yellow flame appears._)
7415,BEELZEBUB,
7416,BEELZEBUB,
7417,BEELZEBUB,This is a grandsire’s treason in an orchard
7418,BEELZEBUB,Against a maid whose nature with his mated.
7419,BEELZEBUB,
7420,BEELZEBUB,(_Lurid flames appear._)
7421,BEELZEBUB,
7422,BEELZEBUB,
7423,BEELZEBUB,"And this his memory distrait and tortured,"
7424,BEELZEBUB,Which marked the child with hate because she hated.
7425,BEELZEBUB,Our heroine’s grand dame was that maid’s own cousin—
7426,BEELZEBUB,But never this our man and woman knew.
7427,BEELZEBUB,"The child, in time, of lovers had a dozen,"
7428,BEELZEBUB,Then wed a gentleman upright and true.
7429,BEELZEBUB,And thus our hero had a double nature:
7430,BEELZEBUB,"One half of him was bad, the other good."
7431,BEELZEBUB,The devil must exhaust his nomenclature
7432,BEELZEBUB,To make this puzzle rightly understood.
7433,BEELZEBUB,But when our hero and our heroine met
7434,BEELZEBUB,"They were at once attracted, the repulsion"
7435,BEELZEBUB,"Was hidden under Passion, with her net"
7436,BEELZEBUB,Which must enmesh you ere you feel revulsion.
7437,BEELZEBUB,"The virus coursing in the soldier’s blood,"
7438,BEELZEBUB,"The orchard’s ghost, the unknown kinship ’twixt them,"
7439,BEELZEBUB,"Our hero’s mother’s lovers round them stood,"
7440,BEELZEBUB,Shadows that smiled to see how Fate had fixed them.
7441,BEELZEBUB,"This twain pledge vows and marry, that’s the play."
7442,BEELZEBUB,And then the tragic features rise and deepen.
7443,BEELZEBUB,He is a tender husband. When away
7444,BEELZEBUB,The serpents from the orchard slyly creep in.
7445,BEELZEBUB,"Our heroine, born of spirit none too loyal,"
7446,BEELZEBUB,Picks fruit of knowledge—leaves the tree of life.
7447,BEELZEBUB,"Her fancy turns to France corrupt and royal,"
7448,BEELZEBUB,Soon she forgets her duty as a wife.
7449,BEELZEBUB,"You know the rest, so far as that’s concerned,"
7450,BEELZEBUB,She met exposure and her husband slew her.
7451,BEELZEBUB,"He lost his reason, for the love she spurned."
7452,BEELZEBUB,He prized her as his own—how slight he knew her.
7453,BEELZEBUB,"(_He waves a wand, showing a man in a prison cell._)"
7454,BEELZEBUB,Now here he sits condemned to mount the gallows—
7455,BEELZEBUB,He could not tell his story—he is dumb.
7456,BEELZEBUB,"Love, says your poets, is a grace that hallows,"
7457,BEELZEBUB,I call it suffering and martyrdom.
7458,BEELZEBUB,"The judge with pointed finger says, “You killed her.”"
7459,BEELZEBUB,"Well, so he did—but here’s the explanation;"
7460,BEELZEBUB,"He could not give it. I, the drama-builder,"
7461,BEELZEBUB,Show you the various truths and their relation.
7462,BEELZEBUB,(_He waves his wand._)
7463,BEELZEBUB,"Now, to begin. The curtain is ascending,"
7464,BEELZEBUB,They meet at tea upon a flowery lawn.
7465,BEELZEBUB,"Fair, is it not? How sweet their souls are blending—"
7466,BEELZEBUB,The author calls the play “Laocoon.”
7467,BEELZEBUB,

7538,FOURTH VOICE,Awaken roots under cover of soil—it is Spring again.”
7539,FOURTH VOICE,"Then the sun exults, the moon is at peace, and voices"
7540,FOURTH VOICE,Call to the silver shadows to lift the flowers from their dreams.
7541,FOURTH VOICE,"And a longing, longing enters my heart of sorrow, my heart that rejoices"
7542,FOURTH VOICE,"In the fleeting glimpse of a shining face, and her hair that gleams."
7543,FOURTH VOICE,I arise and follow alone for hours the winding way by the river.
7544,FOURTH VOICE,"Hunting a vanishing light, and a solace for joy too deep."
7545,FOURTH VOICE,"Where do you lead me, wild one, on and on forever?"

7550,THE SUN,"Speeds the soul of me, silent thunder, struck from a harp of fire."
7551,THE SUN,"Before my eyes the planets wheel and a universe defiles,"
7552,THE SUN,I but a luminant speck of dust upborne in a vast desire.
7553,THE SUN,What is my universe that obeys me—myself compelled to obey
7554,THE SUN,A power that holds me and whirls me over a path that has no end?
7555,THE SUN,"And there are my children who call me great, the giver of life and day,"
7556,THE SUN,Myself a child who cry for life and know not whither I tend.
7557,THE SUN,"A million million suns above me, as if the curtain of night"
7558,THE SUN,"Were hung before creation’s flame, that shone through the weave of the cloth,"
7559,THE SUN,"Each with its worlds and worlds and worlds crying upward for light,"
7560,THE SUN,For each is drawn in its course to what?—as the candle draws the moth.
