179,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"And sloth and foolishness, and all ill weeds"
180,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"Of error, evil, and neglect grow rank"
181,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"And ugly there, I dare forgive myself"
182,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"That error, sin, and sloth and foolishness."
183,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,God knows that yesterday I played the fool;
184,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,God knows that yesterday I played the knave;
185,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,But shall I therefore cloud this new dawn o'er
186,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,With fog of futile sighs and vain regrets?
187,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,
188,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,This is another day!  And flushed Hope walks
189,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,Adown the sunward slopes with golden shoon.
190,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,This is another day; and its young strength
191,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"Is laid upon the quivering hills until,"
192,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"Like Egypt's Memnon, they grow quick with song."
193,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"This is another day, and the bold world"
194,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"Leaps up and grasps its light, and laughs, as leapt"
195,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,Prometheus up and wrenched the fire from Zeus.
196,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,
197,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,This is another day--are its eyes blurred
198,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,With maudlin grief for any wasted past?
199,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,A thousand thousand failures shall not daunt!
200,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,"Let dust clasp dust; death, death--I am alive!"
201,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,And out of all the dust and death of mine
202,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,Old selves I dare to lift a singing heart
203,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,And living faith; my spirit dares drink deep
204,THIS IS ANOTHER DAY,Of the red mirth mantling in the cup of morn.

366,THE POOL,
367,THE POOL,Down-stream all the rapids are troubled with pebbles
368,THE POOL,"That fetter and fret what the water would utter,"
369,THE POOL,And it rushes and splashes in tremulous trebles;
370,THE POOL,"It makes haste through the shallows, its soul is"

372,THE POOL,
373,THE POOL,But here all the sound is serene and outspread
374,THE POOL,In the murmurous moods of a slow-swirling pool;
375,THE POOL,Here all the sounds are unhurried and cool;
376,THE POOL,"Every silence is kith to a sound; they are wed,"
377,THE POOL,"They are mated, are mingled, are tangled, are"
378,THE POOL,bound;
379,THE POOL,"Every hush is in love with a sound, every sound"
380,THE POOL,By the law of its life to some silence is bound.
381,THE POOL,
382,THE POOL,"Then here will we hide; idle here and abide,"
383,THE POOL,"In the covert here, close by the waterside--"
384,THE POOL,"Here, where the slim flattered reeds are aquiver"
385,THE POOL,"With the exquisite hints of the reticent river,"
386,THE POOL,"Here, where the lips of this pool are the lips"
387,THE POOL,"Of all pools, let us listen and question and wait;"
388,THE POOL,"Let us hark to the whispers of love and of death,"
389,THE POOL,Let us hark to the lispings of life and of fate--
390,THE POOL,In this place where pale silences flower into sound
391,THE POOL,Let us strive for some secret of all the profound
392,THE POOL,Deep and calm Silence that meshes men 'round!
393,THE POOL,There's as much of God hinted in one ripple's
394,THE POOL,plashes--
395,THE POOL,There's as much of Truth glints in yon
396,THE POOL,dragon-fly's flight--
397,THE POOL,There's as much Purpose gleams where yonder
398,THE POOL,trout flashes
399,THE POOL,As in--any book else!--could we read things
400,THE POOL,aright.
401,THE POOL,
402,THE POOL,"Then nymph of mine indolence, here let us hide,"
403,THE POOL,"Learn, listen, and question; idle here and abide"

3291,THE STRUGGLE,I HAVE been down in a dark valley;
3292,THE STRUGGLE,I have been groping through a deep gorge;
3293,THE STRUGGLE,"Far above, the lips of it were rimmed with moonlight,"
3294,THE STRUGGLE,And here and there the light lay on the dripping
3295,THE STRUGGLE,rocks
3296,THE STRUGGLE,"So that it seemed they dripped with moonlight,"
3297,THE STRUGGLE,not with water;
3298,THE STRUGGLE,"So deep it was, that narrow gash among the hills,"
3299,THE STRUGGLE,That those great pines which fringed its edge
3300,THE STRUGGLE,Seemed to me no larger than upthrust fingers
3301,THE STRUGGLE,Silhouetted against the sky;
3302,THE STRUGGLE,"And at its top the vale was strait,"
3303,THE STRUGGLE,And the rays were slant
3304,THE STRUGGLE,And reached but part way down the sides;
3305,THE STRUGGLE,I could not see the moon itself;
3306,THE STRUGGLE,"I walked through darkness, and the valley's edge"
3307,THE STRUGGLE,"Seemed almost level with the stars,"
3308,THE STRUGGLE,The stars that were like fireflies in the little trees.
3309,THE STRUGGLE,
3310,THE STRUGGLE,It was the midnight of defeat;
3311,THE STRUGGLE,I felt that I had failed;
3312,THE STRUGGLE,I was mocked of the gods;
3313,THE STRUGGLE,There was no way out of that gorge;
3314,THE STRUGGLE,The paths led no whither
3315,THE STRUGGLE,And I could not remember their beginnings;
3316,THE STRUGGLE,"I was doomed to wander evermore,"
3317,THE STRUGGLE,"Thirsty, with the sound of mocking waters in"
3318,THE STRUGGLE,"mine ears,"
3319,THE STRUGGLE,"Groping, with gleams of useless light"
3320,THE STRUGGLE,Splashed in ironic beauty on the rocks above.
3321,THE STRUGGLE,And so I whined.
3322,THE STRUGGLE,
3323,THE STRUGGLE,And then despair flashed into rage;
3324,THE STRUGGLE,"I leapt erect, and cried:"
3325,THE STRUGGLE,"_""Could I but grasp my life as sculptors grasp the clay"
3326,THE STRUGGLE,And knead and thrust it into shape again!--

3349,THE STRUGGLE,"You who have mingled death with beauty,"
3350,THE STRUGGLE,You who have put into my blood the impulses for

3352,THE STRUGGLE,You who permitted my brain the doubts wherefore
3353,THE STRUGGLE,"you damn me,"
3354,THE STRUGGLE,"Behold, I doubt you, gods, no longer, but defy!--"
3355,THE STRUGGLE,I perish here?
3356,THE STRUGGLE,Then I will be slain of a god!

3361,THE STRUGGLE,"And dares,"
3362,THE STRUGGLE,"And flings you back your scorn,--"
3363,THE STRUGGLE,"Come, face to face, and slay me if you will,"
3364,THE STRUGGLE,But not until you've felt the weight
3365,THE STRUGGLE,Of all betricked humanity's contempt
3366,THE STRUGGLE,In one bold blow!--
3367,THE STRUGGLE,"Speak forth a Reason, and I will answer it,"
3368,THE STRUGGLE,"Yes, to your faces I will answer it;"
3369,THE STRUGGLE,"Come garmented in flesh and I will fight with you,"
3370,THE STRUGGLE,"Yes, in your faces will I smite you, gods;"
3371,THE STRUGGLE,Coward gods and tricksters that set traps
3372,THE STRUGGLE,In paradise!--
3373,THE STRUGGLE,Far gods that hedge yourselves about with silence
3374,THE STRUGGLE,And with distance;

3377,THE STRUGGLE,
3378,THE STRUGGLE,"Thus I raved, being mad."
3379,THE STRUGGLE,I had no sooner finished speaking than I felt
3380,THE STRUGGLE,"The darkness fluttered by approaching feet,"
3381,THE STRUGGLE,And the silence was burned through by trembling
3382,THE STRUGGLE,"flames of sound,"
3383,THE STRUGGLE,And I was 'ware that Something stood by me.
3384,THE STRUGGLE,
3385,THE STRUGGLE,"And with a shout I leapt and grasped that Being,"
3386,THE STRUGGLE,And the Thing grasped me.
3387,THE STRUGGLE,"We came to wrestling grips,"
3388,THE STRUGGLE,"And back and forth we swayed,"
3389,THE STRUGGLE,"Hand seeking throat, and crook'd knee seeking"
3390,THE STRUGGLE,"To encrook unwary leg,"
3391,THE STRUGGLE,And spread toes grasping the uneven ground;
3392,THE STRUGGLE,"The strained breast muscles cracked and creaked,"
3393,THE STRUGGLE,"The sweat ran in my eyes,"
3394,THE STRUGGLE,The plagued breath sobbed and whistled through
3395,THE STRUGGLE,"my throat,"
3396,THE STRUGGLE,"I tasted blood, and strangled, but still struggled"
3397,THE STRUGGLE,on--
3398,THE STRUGGLE,The stars above me danced in swarms like yellow
3399,THE STRUGGLE,"bees,"
3400,THE STRUGGLE,The shaken moonlight writhed upon the rocks;--
3401,THE STRUGGLE,"But at the last I felt his breathing weaker grow,"
3402,THE STRUGGLE,"The tense limbs grow less tense,"
3403,THE STRUGGLE,And with a bursting cry I bent his head right
3404,THE STRUGGLE,"back,"
3405,THE STRUGGLE,"Back, back, until"
3406,THE STRUGGLE,I heard his neck bones snap;
3407,THE STRUGGLE,His spine crunched in my grip;
3408,THE STRUGGLE,I flung him to the earth and knelt upon his breast
3409,THE STRUGGLE,
3410,THE STRUGGLE,And listened till the fluttering pulse was stilled.
3411,THE STRUGGLE,"Man, god, or devil, I had wrenched the life from"
3412,THE STRUGGLE,him!
3413,THE STRUGGLE,
3414,THE STRUGGLE,And lo!--even as he died
3415,THE STRUGGLE,"The moonlight failed above the vale,--"
3416,THE STRUGGLE,"And somehow, sure, I know now how!--"
3417,THE STRUGGLE,Between the rifted rocks the great Sun struck
3418,THE STRUGGLE,"A finger down the cliff, and that red beam"
3419,THE STRUGGLE,Lay sharp across the face of him that I had slain;
3420,THE STRUGGLE,And in that light I read the answer of the silent
3421,THE STRUGGLE,gods
3422,THE STRUGGLE,"Unto my cursed-out prayer,"
