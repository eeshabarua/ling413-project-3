49,TO MY READERS,
50,TO MY READERS,"NAY, blame me not; I might have spared"
51,TO MY READERS,"Your patience many a trivial verse,"
52,TO MY READERS,"Yet these my earlier welcome shared,"
53,TO MY READERS,"So, let the better shield the worse."
54,TO MY READERS,
55,TO MY READERS,"And some might say, ""Those ruder songs"
56,TO MY READERS,Had freshness which the new have lost;
57,TO MY READERS,"To spring the opening leaf belongs,"
58,TO MY READERS,"The chestnut-burs await the frost."""
59,TO MY READERS,
60,TO MY READERS,"When those I wrote, my locks were brown,"
61,TO MY READERS,"When these I write--ah, well a-day!"
62,TO MY READERS,The autumn thistle's silvery down
63,TO MY READERS,Is not the purple bloom of May.
64,TO MY READERS,
65,TO MY READERS,"Go, little book, whose pages hold"
66,TO MY READERS,Those garnered years in loving trust;
67,TO MY READERS,How long before your blue and gold
68,TO MY READERS,Shall fade and whiten in the dust?
69,TO MY READERS,
70,TO MY READERS,"O sexton of the alcoved tomb,"
71,TO MY READERS,"Where souls in leathern cerements lie,"
72,TO MY READERS,Tell me each living poet's doom!
73,TO MY READERS,How long before his book shall die?
74,TO MY READERS,
75,TO MY READERS,"It matters little, soon or late,"
76,TO MY READERS,"A day, a month, a year, an age,--"
77,TO MY READERS,"I read oblivion in its date,"
78,TO MY READERS,And Finis on its title-page.
79,TO MY READERS,
80,TO MY READERS,"Before we sighed, our griefs were told;"
81,TO MY READERS,"Before we smiled, our joys were sung;"
82,TO MY READERS,And all our passions shaped of old
83,TO MY READERS,In accents lost to mortal tongue.
84,TO MY READERS,
85,TO MY READERS,"In vain a fresher mould we seek,--"
86,TO MY READERS,Can all the varied phrases tell
87,TO MY READERS,That Babel's wandering children speak
88,TO MY READERS,How thrushes sing or lilacs smell?
89,TO MY READERS,
90,TO MY READERS,"Caged in the poet's lonely heart,"
91,TO MY READERS,Love wastes unheard its tenderest tone;
92,TO MY READERS,"The soul that sings must dwell apart,"
93,TO MY READERS,Its inward melodies unknown.
94,TO MY READERS,
95,TO MY READERS,"Deal gently with us, ye who read"
96,TO MY READERS,"Our largest hope is unfulfilled,--"
97,TO MY READERS,"The promise still outruns the deed,--"
98,TO MY READERS,"The tower, but not the spire, we build."
99,TO MY READERS,
100,TO MY READERS,Our whitest pearl we never find;
101,TO MY READERS,Our ripest fruit we never reach;
102,TO MY READERS,The flowering moments of the mind
103,TO MY READERS,Drop half their petals in our speech.
104,TO MY READERS,
105,TO MY READERS,These are my blossoms; if they wear
106,TO MY READERS,"One streak of morn or evening's glow,"
107,TO MY READERS,Accept them; but to me more fair
108,TO MY READERS,The buds of song that never blow.

118,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
119,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,This was the popular name by which the frigate Constitution
120,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,was known. The poem was first printed in the Boston Daily
121,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Advertiser, at the time when it was proposed to break up the"
122,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,old ship as unfit for service. I subjoin the paragraph which
123,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,led to the writing of the poem. It is from the Advertiser of
124,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Tuesday, September 14, 1830:--"
125,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
126,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"""Old Ironsides.--It has been affirmed upon good authority"
127,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,that the Secretary of the Navy has recommended to the Board of
128,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Navy Commissioners to dispose of the frigate Constitution. Since
129,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,it has been understood that such a step was in contemplation we
130,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"have heard but one opinion expressed, and that in decided"
131,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"disapprobation of the measure. Such a national object of interest,"
132,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"so endeared to our national pride as Old Ironsides is, should"
133,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"never by any act of our government cease to belong to the Navy,"
134,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,so long as our country is to be found upon the map of nations.
135,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,In England it was lately determined by the Admiralty to cut the
136,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Victory, a one-hundred gun ship (which it will be recollected bore"
137,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"the flag of Lord Nelson at the battle of Trafalgar,) down to a"
138,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"seventy-four, but so loud were the lamentations of the people upon"
139,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,the proposed measure that the intention was abandoned. We
140,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,confidently anticipate that the Secretary of the Navy will in like
141,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"manner consult the general wish in regard to the Constitution, and"
142,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,either let her remain in ordinary or rebuild her whenever the
143,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"public service may require.""--New York Journal of Commerce."
144,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
145,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The poem was an impromptu outburst of feeling and was published
146,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,on the next day but one after reading the above paragraph.
147,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
148,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"AY, tear her tattered ensign down"
149,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Long has it waved on high,"
150,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,And many an eye has danced to see
151,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,That banner in the sky;
152,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Beneath it rung the battle shout,"
153,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,And burst the cannon's roar;--
154,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The meteor of the ocean air
155,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Shall sweep the clouds no more.
156,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
157,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,"
158,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Where knelt the vanquished foe,"
159,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"When winds were hurrying o'er the flood,"
160,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"And waves were white below,"
161,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"No more shall feel the victor's tread,"
162,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Or know the conquered knee;--
163,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The harpies of the shore shall pluck
164,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The eagle of the sea!
165,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,
166,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Oh better that her shattered hulk
167,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,Should sink beneath the wave;
168,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Her thunders shook the mighty deep,"
169,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,And there should be her grave;
170,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Nail to the mast her holy flag,"
171,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"Set every threadbare sail,"
172,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,"And give her to the god of storms,"
173,1830-1836 OLD IRONSIDES,The lightning and the gale!

179,THE LAST LEAF,THE LAST LEAF
180,THE LAST LEAF,
181,THE LAST LEAF,This poem was suggested by the appearance in one of our
182,THE LAST LEAF,"streets of a venerable relic of the Revolution, said to be one"
183,THE LAST LEAF,of the party who threw the tea overboard in Boston Harbor. He
184,THE LAST LEAF,was a fine monumental specimen in his cocked hat and knee
185,THE LAST LEAF,"breeches, with his buckled shoes and his sturdy cane. The smile"
186,THE LAST LEAF,"with which I, as a young man, greeted him, meant no disrespect to"
187,THE LAST LEAF,"an honored fellow-citizen whose costume was out of date, but whose"
188,THE LAST LEAF,patriotism never changed with years. I do not recall any earlier
189,THE LAST LEAF,"example of this form of verse, which was commended by the fastidious"
190,THE LAST LEAF,"Edgar Allan Poe, who made a copy of the whole poem which I have"
191,THE LAST LEAF,in his own handwriting. Good Abraham Lincoln had a great liking
192,THE LAST LEAF,"for the poem, and repeated it from memory to Governor Andrew,"
193,THE LAST LEAF,as the governor himself told me.
194,THE LAST LEAF,
195,THE LAST LEAF,"I SAW him once before,"
196,THE LAST LEAF,"As he passed by the door,"
197,THE LAST LEAF,And again
198,THE LAST LEAF,"The pavement stones resound,"
199,THE LAST LEAF,As he totters o'er the ground
200,THE LAST LEAF,With his cane.
201,THE LAST LEAF,
202,THE LAST LEAF,"They say that in his prime,"
203,THE LAST LEAF,Ere the pruning-knife of Time
204,THE LAST LEAF,"Cut him down,"
205,THE LAST LEAF,Not a better man was found
206,THE LAST LEAF,By the Crier on his round
207,THE LAST LEAF,Through the town.
208,THE LAST LEAF,
209,THE LAST LEAF,"But now he walks the streets,"
210,THE LAST LEAF,And he looks at all he meets
211,THE LAST LEAF,"Sad and wan,"
212,THE LAST LEAF,"And he shakes his feeble head,"
213,THE LAST LEAF,"That it seems as if he said,"
214,THE LAST LEAF,"""They are gone."""
215,THE LAST LEAF,
216,THE LAST LEAF,The mossy marbles rest
217,THE LAST LEAF,On the lips that he has prest
218,THE LAST LEAF,"In their bloom,"
219,THE LAST LEAF,And the names he loved to hear
220,THE LAST LEAF,Have been carved for many a year
221,THE LAST LEAF,On the tomb.
222,THE LAST LEAF,
223,THE LAST LEAF,My grandmamma has said--
224,THE LAST LEAF,"Poor old lady, she is dead"
225,THE LAST LEAF,Long ago--
226,THE LAST LEAF,"That he had a Roman nose,"
227,THE LAST LEAF,And his cheek was like a rose
228,THE LAST LEAF,In the snow.
229,THE LAST LEAF,
230,THE LAST LEAF,"But now his nose is thin,"
231,THE LAST LEAF,And it rests upon his chin
232,THE LAST LEAF,"Like a staff,"
233,THE LAST LEAF,"And a crook is in his back,"
234,THE LAST LEAF,And a melancholy crack
235,THE LAST LEAF,In his laugh.
236,THE LAST LEAF,
237,THE LAST LEAF,I know it is a sin
238,THE LAST LEAF,For me to sit and grin
239,THE LAST LEAF,At him here;
240,THE LAST LEAF,"But the old three-cornered hat,"
241,THE LAST LEAF,"And the breeches, and all that,"
242,THE LAST LEAF,Are so queer!
243,THE LAST LEAF,
244,THE LAST LEAF,And if I should live to be
245,THE LAST LEAF,The last leaf upon the tree
246,THE LAST LEAF,"In the spring,"
247,THE LAST LEAF,"Let them smile, as I do now,"
248,THE LAST LEAF,At the old forsaken bough
249,THE LAST LEAF,Where I cling.
250,THE LAST LEAF,
251,THE LAST LEAF,
252,THE LAST LEAF,
253,THE LAST LEAF,
254,THE LAST LEAF,
255,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD
256,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
257,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"OUR ancient church! its lowly tower,"
258,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Beneath the loftier spire,"
259,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Is shadowed when the sunset hour
260,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Clothes the tall shaft in fire;
261,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,It sinks beyond the distant eye
262,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Long ere the glittering vane,"
263,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"High wheeling in the western sky,"
264,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Has faded o'er the plain.
265,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
266,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Like Sentinel and Nun, they keep"
267,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Their vigil on the green;
268,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"One seems to guard, and one to weep,"
269,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The dead that lie between;
270,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And both roll out, so full and near,"
271,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Their music's mingling waves,"
272,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"They shake the grass, whose pennoned spear"
273,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Leans on the narrow graves.
274,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
275,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The stranger parts the flaunting weeds,"
276,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Whose seeds the winds have strown
277,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"So thick, beneath the line he reads,"
278,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,They shade the sculptured stone;
279,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The child unveils his clustered brow,"
280,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,And ponders for a while
281,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The graven willow's pendent bough,"
282,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Or rudest cherub's smile.
283,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
284,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"But what to them the dirge, the knell?"
285,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"These were the mourner's share,--"
286,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The sullen clang, whose heavy swell"
287,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Throbbed through the beating air;
288,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The rattling cord, the rolling stone,"
289,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The shelving sand that slid,"
290,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And, far beneath, with hollow tone"
291,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Rung on the coffin's lid.
292,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
293,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The slumberer's mound grows fresh and green,"
294,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Then slowly disappears;
295,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The mosses creep, the gray stones lean,"
296,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Earth hides his date and years;
297,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"But, long before the once-loved name"
298,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Is sunk or worn away,"
299,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"No lip the silent dust may claim,"
300,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,That pressed the breathing clay.
301,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
302,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Go where the ancient pathway guides,"
303,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,See where our sires laid down
304,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Their smiling babes, their cherished brides,"
305,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The patriarchs of the town;
306,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Hast thou a tear for buried love?
307,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,A sigh for transient power?
308,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"All that a century left above,"
309,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Go, read it in an hour!"
310,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
311,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The Indian's shaft, the Briton's ball,"
312,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The sabre's thirsting edge,"
313,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The hot shell, shattering in its fall,"
314,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The bayonet's rending wedge,--"
315,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Here scattered death; yet, seek the spot,"
316,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"No trace thine eye can see,"
317,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"No altar,--and they need it not"
318,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Who leave their children free!
319,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
320,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Look where the turbid rain-drops stand
321,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,In many a chiselled square;
322,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The knightly crest, the shield, the brand"
323,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Of honored names were there;--
324,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Alas! for every tear is dried
325,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Those blazoned tablets knew,"
326,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Save when the icy marble's side
327,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Drips with the evening dew.
328,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
329,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Or gaze upon yon pillared stone,"
330,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The empty urn of pride;
331,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"There stand the Goblet and the Sun,--"
332,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,What need of more beside?
333,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Where lives the memory of the dead,"
334,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Who made their tomb a toy?
335,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Whose ashes press that nameless bed?
336,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Go, ask the village boy!"
337,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
338,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Lean o'er the slender western wall,"
339,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Ye ever-roaming girls;
340,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,The breath that bids the blossom fall
341,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"May lift your floating curls,"
342,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,To sweep the simple lines that tell
343,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,An exile's date and doom;
344,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And sigh, for where his daughters dwell,"
345,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,They wreathe the stranger's tomb.
346,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
347,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And one amid these shades was born,"
348,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Beneath this turf who lies,"
349,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Once beaming as the summer's morn,"
350,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,That closed her gentle eyes;
351,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"If sinless angels love as we,"
352,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Who stood thy grave beside,"
353,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Three seraph welcomes waited thee,"
354,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The daughter, sister, bride."
355,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
356,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,I wandered to thy buried mound
357,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,When earth was hid below
358,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The level of the glaring ground,"
359,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Choked to its gates with snow,"
360,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,And when with summer's flowery waves
361,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"The lake of verdure rolled,"
362,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,As if a Sultan's white-robed slaves
363,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Had scattered pearls and gold.
364,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
365,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Nay, the soft pinions of the air,"
366,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"That lift this trembling tone,"
367,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Its breath of love may almost bear
368,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,To kiss thy funeral stone;
369,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And, now thy smiles have passed away,"
370,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"For all the joy they gave,"
371,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,May sweetest dews and warmest ray
372,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Lie on thine early grave!
373,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,
374,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,When damps beneath and storms above
375,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Have bowed these fragile towers,"
376,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Still o'er the graves yon locust grove
377,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Shall swing its Orient flowers;
378,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"And I would ask no mouldering bust,"
379,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"If e'er this humble line,"
380,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,"Which breathed a sigh o'er other's dust,"
381,THE CAMBRIDGE CHURCHYARD,Might call a tear on mine.

391,TO AN INSECT,"I used to hear this insect in Providence, Rhode Island, but I"
392,TO AN INSECT,"do not remember hearing it in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where"
393,TO AN INSECT,I passed my boyhood. It is well known in other towns in the

467,THE DILEMMA,"From every beam a rope was hung,"
468,THE DILEMMA,In every rope a lover swung;
469,THE DILEMMA,I asked the hue of every eye
470,THE DILEMMA,That bade each luckless lover die;
471,THE DILEMMA,"Ten shadowy lips said, heavenly blue,"
472,THE DILEMMA,And ten accused the darker hue.
473,THE DILEMMA,
474,THE DILEMMA,I asked a matron which she deemed

477,THE DILEMMA,Give her blue eyes and golden hair.
478,THE DILEMMA,"I might have liked her judgment well,"
479,THE DILEMMA,"But, as she spoke, she rung the bell,"
480,THE DILEMMA,"And all her girls, nor small nor few,"
481,THE DILEMMA,"Came marching in,--their eyes were blue."
482,THE DILEMMA,
483,THE DILEMMA,I asked a maiden; back she flung
484,THE DILEMMA,"The locks that round her forehead hung,"
485,THE DILEMMA,"And turned her eye, a glorious one,"
486,THE DILEMMA,"Bright as a diamond in the sun,"
487,THE DILEMMA,"On me, until beneath its rays"
488,THE DILEMMA,I felt as if my hair would blaze;
489,THE DILEMMA,She liked all eyes but eyes of green;
490,THE DILEMMA,She looked at me; what could she mean?

503,THE DILEMMA,"And both, with but a single ray,"

841,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Would suit your style of face!
842,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,
843,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,I love sweet features; I will own
844,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,That I should like myself
845,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"To see my portrait on a wall,"
846,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Or bust upon a shelf;
847,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,But nature sometimes makes one up
848,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,"Of such sad odds and ends,"
849,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,It really might be quite as well
850,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,Hushed up among one's friends!
851,IN THE ATHENAEUM GALLERY,

856,THE COMET,THE COMET
857,THE COMET,
858,THE COMET,"THE Comet! He is on his way,"
859,THE COMET,And singing as he flies;
860,THE COMET,The whizzing planets shrink before
861,THE COMET,The spectre of the skies;
862,THE COMET,"Ah! well may regal orbs burn blue,"
863,THE COMET,"And satellites turn pale,"
864,THE COMET,"Ten million cubic miles of head,"
865,THE COMET,Ten billion leagues of tail!
866,THE COMET,
867,THE COMET,"On, on by whistling spheres of light"
868,THE COMET,He flashes and he flames;
869,THE COMET,"He turns not to the left nor right,"
870,THE COMET,He asks them not their names;
871,THE COMET,"One spurn from his demoniac heel,--"
872,THE COMET,"Away, away they fly,"
873,THE COMET,Where darkness might be bottled up
874,THE COMET,"And sold for ""Tyrian dye."""
875,THE COMET,
876,THE COMET,"And what would happen to the land,"
877,THE COMET,"And how would look the sea,"
878,THE COMET,If in the bearded devil's path
879,THE COMET,Our earth should chance to be?
880,THE COMET,"Full hot and high the sea would boil,"
881,THE COMET,Full red the forests gleam;
882,THE COMET,Methought I saw and heard it all
883,THE COMET,In a dyspeptic dream!
884,THE COMET,
885,THE COMET,I saw a tutor take his tube
886,THE COMET,The Comet's course to spy;
887,THE COMET,"I heard a scream,--the gathered rays"
888,THE COMET,Had stewed the tutor's eye;
889,THE COMET,"I saw a fort,--the soldiers all"
890,THE COMET,Were armed with goggles green;
891,THE COMET,Pop cracked the guns! whiz flew the balls!
892,THE COMET,Bang went the magazine!
893,THE COMET,
894,THE COMET,I saw a poet dip a scroll
895,THE COMET,"Each moment in a tub,"
896,THE COMET,"I read upon the warping back,"
897,THE COMET,"""The Dream of Beelzebub;"""
898,THE COMET,"He could not see his verses burn,"
899,THE COMET,"Although his brain was fried,"
900,THE COMET,And ever and anon he bent
901,THE COMET,To wet them as they dried.
902,THE COMET,
903,THE COMET,I saw the scalding pitch roll down
904,THE COMET,"The crackling, sweating pines,"
905,THE COMET,"And streams of smoke, like water-spouts,"
906,THE COMET,Burst through the rumbling mines;
907,THE COMET,I asked the firemen why they made
908,THE COMET,Such noise about the town;
909,THE COMET,"They answered not,--but all the while"
910,THE COMET,The brakes went up and down.
911,THE COMET,
912,THE COMET,I saw a roasting pullet sit
913,THE COMET,Upon a baking egg;
914,THE COMET,I saw a cripple scorch his hand
915,THE COMET,Extinguishing his leg;
916,THE COMET,I saw nine geese upon the wing
917,THE COMET,"Towards the frozen pole,"
918,THE COMET,And every mother's gosling fell
919,THE COMET,Crisped to a crackling coal.
920,THE COMET,
921,THE COMET,I saw the ox that browsed the grass
922,THE COMET,"Writhe in the blistering rays,"
923,THE COMET,The herbage in his shrinking jaws
924,THE COMET,Was all a fiery blaze;
925,THE COMET,"I saw huge fishes, boiled to rags,"
926,THE COMET,Bob through the bubbling brine;
927,THE COMET,And thoughts of supper crossed my soul;
928,THE COMET,I had been rash at mine.
929,THE COMET,
930,THE COMET,Strange sights! strange sounds! Oh fearful dream!
931,THE COMET,"Its memory haunts me still,"
932,THE COMET,"The steaming sea, the crimson glare,"
933,THE COMET,That wreathed each wooded hill;
934,THE COMET,Stranger! if through thy reeling brain
935,THE COMET,"Such midnight visions sweep,"
936,THE COMET,"Spare, spare, oh, spare thine evening meal,"
937,THE COMET,And sweet shall be thy sleep!

944,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
945,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,THERE are three ways in which men take
946,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"One's money from his purse,"
947,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And very hard it is to tell
948,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Which of the three is worse;
949,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,But all of them are bad enough
950,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To make a body curse.
951,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
952,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You're riding out some pleasant day,"
953,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And counting up your gains;
954,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"A fellow jumps from out a bush,"
955,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And takes your horse's reins,"
956,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Another hints some words about
957,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A bullet in your brains.
958,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
959,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,It's hard to meet such pressing friends
960,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,In such a lonely spot;
961,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"It's very hard to lose your cash,"
962,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,But harder to be shot;
963,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And so you take your wallet out,"
964,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Though you would rather not.
965,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
966,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Perhaps you're going out to dine,--"
967,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Some odious creature begs
968,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,You'll hear about the cannon-ball
969,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"That carried off his pegs,"
970,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And says it is a dreadful thing
971,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,For men to lose their legs.
972,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
973,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"He tells you of his starving wife,"
974,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"His children to be fed,"
975,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Poor little, lovely innocents,"
976,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"All clamorous for bread,--"
977,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And so you kindly help to put
978,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A bachelor to bed.
979,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
980,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You're sitting on your window-seat,"
981,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Beneath a cloudless moon;
982,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You hear a sound, that seems to wear"
983,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"The semblance of a tune,"
984,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,As if a broken fife should strive
985,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To drown a cracked bassoon.
986,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
987,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And nearer, nearer still, the tide"
988,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Of music seems to come,"
989,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"There's something like a human voice,"
990,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And something like a drum;
991,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You sit in speechless agony,"
992,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Until your ear is numb.
993,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
994,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Poor ""home, sweet home"" should seem to be"
995,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A very dismal place;
996,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Your ""auld acquaintance"" all at once"
997,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Is altered in the face;
998,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Their discords sting through Burns and Moore,"
999,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Like hedgehogs dressed in lace.
1000,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1001,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"You think they are crusaders, sent"
1002,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"From some infernal clime,"
1003,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"To pluck the eyes of Sentiment,"
1004,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And dock the tail of Rhyme,"
1005,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"To crack the voice of Melody,"
1006,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And break the legs of Time.
1007,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1008,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"But hark! the air again is still,"
1009,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"The music all is ground,"
1010,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And silence, like a poultice, comes"
1011,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To heal the blows of sound;
1012,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"It cannot be,--it is,--it is,--"
1013,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,A hat is going round!
1014,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1015,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,No! Pay the dentist when he leaves
1016,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"A fracture in your jaw,"
1017,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And pay the owner of the bear
1018,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"That stunned you with his paw,"
1019,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And buy the lobster that has had
1020,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Your knuckles in his claw;
1021,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1022,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"But if you are a portly man,"
1023,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Put on your fiercest frown,"
1024,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And talk about a constable
1025,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,To turn them out of town;
1026,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Then close your sentence with an oath,"
1027,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,And shut the window down!
1028,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,
1029,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"And if you are a slender man,"
1030,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Not big enough for that,"
1031,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Or, if you cannot make a speech,"
1032,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,"Because you are a flat,"
1033,THE MUSIC-GRINDERS,Go very quietly and drop

1050,THE TREADMILL SONG,
1051,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Wake up, wake up, my duck-legged man,"
1052,THE TREADMILL SONG,And stir your solid pegs
1053,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Arouse, arouse, my gawky friend,"

1056,THE TREADMILL SONG,"There's time enough to learn,--"
1057,THE TREADMILL SONG,"So lean upon the rail, my lad,"

1059,THE TREADMILL SONG,
1060,THE TREADMILL SONG,"They've built us up a noble wall,"
1061,THE TREADMILL SONG,To keep the vulgar out;
1062,THE TREADMILL SONG,We've nothing in the world to do

1064,THE TREADMILL SONG,"So faster, now, you middle men,"

1073,THE TREADMILL SONG,"He's lost them both,--don't pull his hair,"
1074,THE TREADMILL SONG,"Because he wears a scratch,"
1075,THE TREADMILL SONG,"But poke him in the further eye,"

1093,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"This tremendous hurricane occurred on the 23d of September,  1815."
1094,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I remember it well, being then seven years old. A full account of"
1095,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"it was published, I think, in the records of the American Academy"
1096,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,of Arts and Sciences. Some of my recollections are given in The
1097,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Seasons, an article to be found in a book of mine entitled Pages"
1098,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,from an Old Volume of Life.
1099,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1100,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I'M not a chicken; I have seen
1101,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Full many a chill September,"
1102,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And though I was a youngster then,"
1103,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,That gale I well remember;
1104,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The day before, my kite-string snapped,"
1105,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And I, my kite pursuing,"
1106,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,The wind whisked off my palm-leaf hat;
1107,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,For me two storms were brewing!
1108,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1109,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"It came as quarrels sometimes do,"
1110,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,When married folks get clashing;
1111,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"There was a heavy sigh or two,"
1112,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Before the fire was flashing,--"
1113,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"A little stir among the clouds,"
1114,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"Before they rent asunder,--"
1115,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"A little rocking of the trees,"
1116,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And then came on the thunder.
1117,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1118,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Lord! how the ponds and rivers boiled!
1119,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,They seemed like bursting craters!
1120,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And oaks lay scattered on the ground
1121,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,As if they were p'taters;
1122,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And all above was in a howl,"
1123,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"And all below a clatter,--"
1124,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The earth was like a frying-pan,"
1125,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Or some such hissing matter.
1126,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1127,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"It chanced to be our washing-day,"
1128,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And all our things were drying;
1129,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The storm came roaring through the lines,"
1130,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And set them all a flying;
1131,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I saw the shirts and petticoats
1132,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Go riding off like witches;
1133,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I lost, ah! bitterly I wept,--"
1134,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I lost my Sunday breeches!
1135,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1136,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I saw them straddling through the air,"
1137,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Alas! too late to win them;
1138,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I saw them chase the clouds, as if"
1139,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,The devil had been in them;
1140,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"They were my darlings and my pride,"
1141,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"My boyhood's only riches,--"

1144,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,
1145,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"That night I saw them in my dreams,"
1146,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,How changed from what I knew them!
1147,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"The dews had steeped their faded threads,"
1148,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,The winds had whistled through them
1149,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,I saw the wide and ghastly rents
1150,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,Where demon claws had torn them;
1151,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"A hole was in their amplest part,"
1152,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,As if an imp had worn them.

1154,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,"I have had many happy years,"

1158,THE SEPTEMBER GALE,And not till fate has cut the last

1173,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,
1174,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,"They were so queer, so very queer,"

1193,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,

1198,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,
1199,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,The fourth; he broke into a roar;
1200,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,The fifth; his waistband split;

1202,THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS,And tumbled in a fit.

1282,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1283,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,This Academic Poem presents the simple and partial views of a young
1284,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,person trained after the schools of classical English verse as
1285,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"represented by Pope, Goldsmith, and Campbell, with whose lines his"
1286,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,memory was early stocked. It will be observed that it deals chiefly with
1287,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,the constructive side of the poet's function. That which makes him a
1288,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"poet is not the power of writing melodious rhymes, it is not the"
1289,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,possession of ordinary human sensibilities nor even of both these
1290,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"qualities in connection with each other. I should rather say, if I were"
1291,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"now called upon to define it, it is the power of transfiguring the"
1292,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,experiences and shows of life into an aspect which comes from his
1293,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,imagination and kindles that of others. Emotion is its stimulus and
1294,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"language furnishes its expression; but these are not all, as some might"
1295,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,infer was the doctrine of the poem before the reader.
1296,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1297,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,A common mistake made by young persons who suppose themselves to have
1298,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,the poetical gift is that their own spiritual exaltation finds a true
1299,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,expression in the conventional phrases which are borrowed from the
1300,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,voices of the singers whose inspiration they think they share.
1301,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1302,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Looking at this poem as an expression of some aspects of the _ars
1303,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"poetica_, with some passages which I can read even at this mature period"
1304,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"of life without blushing for them, it may stand as the most serious"
1305,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,representation of my early efforts. Intended as it was for public
1306,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"delivery, many of its paragraphs may betray the fact by their somewhat"
1307,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,rhetorical and sonorous character.
1308,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1309,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,SCENES of my youth! awake its slumbering fire!
1310,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ye winds of Memory, sweep the silent lyre!"
1311,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ray of the past, if yet thou canst appear,"
1312,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Break through the clouds of Fancy's waning year;
1313,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Chase from her breast the thin autumnal snow,"
1314,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If leaf or blossom still is fresh below!
1315,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1316,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Long have I wandered; the returning tide
1317,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Brought back an exile to his cradle's side;
1318,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And as my bark her time-worn flag unrolled,"
1319,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To greet the land-breeze with its faded fold,"
1320,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"So, in remembrance of my boyhood's time,"
1321,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,I lift these ensigns of neglected rhyme;
1322,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Oh, more than blest, that, all my wanderings through,"
1323,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,My anchor falls where first my pennons flew!
1324,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1325,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,. . . . . . . . .
1326,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1327,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The morning light, which rains its quivering beams"
1328,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Wide o'er the plains, the summits, and the streams,"
1329,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,In one broad blaze expands its golden glow
1330,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,On all that answers to its glance below;
1331,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Yet, changed on earth, each far reflected ray"
1332,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Braids with fresh hues the shining brow of day;
1333,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Now, clothed in blushes by the painted flowers,"
1334,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Tracks on their cheeks the rosy-fingered hours;
1335,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Now, lost in shades, whose dark entangled leaves"
1336,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Drip at the noontide from their pendent eaves,"
1337,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Fades into gloom, or gleams in light again"
1338,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,From every dew-drop on the jewelled plain.
1339,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1340,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1341,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"We, like the leaf, the summit, or the wave,"
1342,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Reflect the light our common nature gave,"
1343,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"But every sunbeam, falling from her throne,"
1344,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Wears on our hearts some coloring of our own
1345,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Chilled in the slave, and burning in the free,"
1346,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Like the sealed cavern by the sparkling sea;
1347,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Lost, like the lightning in the sullen clod,"
1348,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Or shedding radiance, like the smiles of God;"
1349,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Pure, pale in Virtue, as the star above,"
1350,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Or quivering roseate on the leaves of Love;
1351,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Glaring like noontide, where it glows upon"
1352,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ambition's sands,--the desert in the sun,--"
1353,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Or soft suffusing o'er the varied scene
1354,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Life's common coloring,--intellectual green."
1355,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1356,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Thus Heaven, repeating its material plan,"
1357,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Arched over all the rainbow mind of man;
1358,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"But he who, blind to universal laws,"
1359,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Sees but effects, unconscious of their cause,--"
1360,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Believes each image in itself is bright,"
1361,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Not robed in drapery of reflected light,--"
1362,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Is like the rustic who, amidst his toil,"
1363,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Has found some crystal in his meagre soil,"
1364,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And, lost in rapture, thinks for him alone"
1365,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Earth worked her wonders on the sparkling stone,"
1366,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Nor dreams that Nature, with as nice a line,"
1367,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Carved countless angles through the boundless mine.
1368,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1369,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Thus err the many, who, entranced to find"
1370,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Unwonted lustre in some clearer mind,"
1371,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Believe that Genius sets the laws at naught
1372,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Which chain the pinions of our wildest thought;
1373,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Untaught to measure, with the eye of art,"
1374,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The wandering fancy or the wayward heart;
1375,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Who match the little only with the less,"
1376,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And gaze in rapture at its slight excess,"
1377,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Proud of a pebble, as the brightest gem"
1378,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Whose light might crown an emperor's diadem.
1379,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1380,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And, most of all, the pure ethereal fire"
1381,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Which seems to radiate from the poet's lyre
1382,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Is to the world a mystery and a charm,"
1383,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"An AEgis wielded on a mortal's arm,"
1384,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"While Reason turns her dazzled eye away,"
1385,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And bows her sceptre to her subject's sway;
1386,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And thus the poet, clothed with godlike state,"
1387,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Usurped his Maker's title--to create;
1388,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"He, whose thoughts differing not in shape, but dress,"
1389,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"What others feel more fitly can express,"
1390,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Sits like the maniac on his fancied throne,"
1391,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Peeps through the bars, and calls the world his own."
1392,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1393,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,There breathes no being but has some pretence
1394,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,To that fine instinct called poetic sense
1395,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The rudest savage, roaming through the wild;"
1396,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The simplest rustic, bending o'er his child;"
1397,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The infant, listening to the warbling bird;"
1398,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The mother, smiling at its half-formed word;"
1399,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The boy uncaged, who tracks the fields at large;"
1400,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The girl, turned matron to her babe-like charge;"
1401,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The freeman, casting with unpurchased hand"
1402,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The vote that shakes the turret of the land;
1403,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The slave, who, slumbering on his rusted chain,"
1404,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Dreams of the palm-trees on his burning plain;
1405,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The hot-cheeked reveller, tossing down the wine,"
1406,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To join the chorus pealing ""Auld lang syne"";"
1407,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The gentle maid, whose azure eye grows dim,"
1408,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,While Heaven is listening to her evening hymn;
1409,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The jewelled beauty, when her steps draw near"
1410,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The circling dance and dazzling chandelier;
1411,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"E'en trembling age, when Spring's renewing air"
1412,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Waves the thin ringlets of his silvered hair;--
1413,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"All, all are glowing with the inward flame,"
1414,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Whose wider halo wreathes the poet's name,"
1415,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"While, unenbalmed, the silent dreamer dies,"
1416,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,His memory passing with his smiles and sighs!
1417,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1418,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If glorious visions, born for all mankind,"
1419,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The bright auroras of our twilight mind;
1420,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If fancies, varying as the shapes that lie"
1421,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Stained on the windows of the sunset sky;
1422,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If hopes, that beckon with delusive gleams,"
1423,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Till the eye dances in the void of dreams;
1424,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"If passions, following with the winds that urge"
1425,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Earth's wildest wanderer to her farthest verge;--
1426,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If these on all some transient hours bestow
1427,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Of rapture tingling with its hectic glow,"
1428,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Then all are poets; and if earth had rolled
1429,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Her myriad centuries, and her doom were told,"
1430,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Each moaning billow of her shoreless wave
1431,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Would wail its requiem o'er a poet's grave!
1432,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1433,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If to embody in a breathing word
1434,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Tones that the spirit trembled when it heard;
1435,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To fix the image all unveiled and warm,"
1436,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And carve in language its ethereal form,"
1437,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"So pure, so perfect, that the lines express"
1438,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"No meagre shrinking, no unlaced excess;"
1439,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"To feel that art, in living truth, has taught"
1440,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Ourselves, reflected in the sculptured thought;--"
1441,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,If this alone bestow the right to claim
1442,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The deathless garland and the sacred name,"
1443,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Then none are poets save the saints on high,"
1444,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Whose harps can murmur all that words deny!
1445,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1446,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,But though to none is granted to reveal
1447,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"In perfect semblance all that each may feel,"
1448,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"As withered flowers recall forgotten love,"
1449,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"So, warmed to life, our faded passions move"
1450,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"In every line, where kindling fancy throws"
1451,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,The gleam of pleasures or the shade of woes.
1452,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1453,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"When, schooled by time, the stately queen of art"
1454,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Had smoothed the pathways leading to the heart,"
1455,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Assumed her measured tread, her solemn tone,"
1456,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And round her courts the clouds of fable thrown,"
1457,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The wreaths of heaven descended on her shrine,"
1458,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And wondering earth proclaimed the Muse divine.
1459,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Yet if her votaries had but dared profane
1460,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The mystic symbols of her sacred reign,"
1461,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,How had they smiled beneath the veil to find
1462,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,What slender threads can chain the mighty mind!
1463,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1464,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1465,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Poets, like painters, their machinery claim,"
1466,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And verse bestows the varnish and the frame;
1467,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Our grating English, whose Teutonic jar"
1468,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Shakes the racked axle of Art's rattling car,"
1469,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Fits like mosaic in the lines that gird
1470,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Fast in its place each many-angled word;
1471,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"From Saxon lips Anacreon's numbers glide,"
1472,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"As once they melted on the Teian tide,"
1473,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"And, fresh transfused, the Iliad thrills again"
1474,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,From Albion's cliffs as o'er Achaia's plain
1475,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The proud heroic, with, its pulse-like beat,"
1476,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Rings like the cymbals clashing as they meet;
1477,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The sweet Spenserian, gathering as it flows,"
1478,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Sweeps gently onward to its dying close,"
1479,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Where waves on waves in long succession pour,"
1480,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Till the ninth billow melts along the shore;
1481,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The lonely spirit of the mournful lay,"
1482,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Which lives immortal as the verse of Gray,"
1483,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"In sable plumage slowly drifts along,"
1484,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"On eagle pinion, through the air of song;"
1485,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"The glittering lyric bounds elastic by,"
1486,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"With flashing ringlets and exulting eye,"
1487,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"While every image, in her airy whirl,"
1488,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Gleams like a diamond on a dancing girl!
1489,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,
1490,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Born with mankind, with man's expanded range"
1491,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,And varying fates the poet's numbers change;
1492,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,Thus in his history may we hope to find
1493,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Some clearer epochs of the poet's mind,"
1494,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"As from the cradle of its birth we trace,"
1495,AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.,"Slow wandering forth, the patriarchal race."

1500,I.,
1501,I.,"When the green earth, beneath the zephyr's wing,"
1502,I.,Wears on her breast the varnished buds of Spring;
1503,I.,"When the loosed current, as its folds uncoil,"
1504,I.,Slides in the channels of the mellowed soil;
1505,I.,When the young hyacinth returns to seek
1506,I.,The air and sunshine with her emerald beak;
1507,I.,"When the light snowdrops, starting from their cells,"
1508,I.,Hang each pagoda with its silver bells;
1509,I.,When the frail willow twines her trailing bow
1510,I.,With pallid leaves that sweep the soil below;
1511,I.,"When the broad elm, sole empress of the plain,"
1512,I.,"Whose circling shadow speaks a century's reign,"
1513,I.,"Wreathes in the clouds her regal diadem,--"
1514,I.,A forest waving on a single stem;--
1515,I.,Then mark the poet; though to him unknown
1516,I.,"The quaint-mouthed titles, such as scholars own,"
1517,I.,See how his eye in ecstasy pursues
1518,I.,The steps of Nature tracked in radiant hues;
1519,I.,"Nay, in thyself, whate'er may be thy fate,"
1520,I.,"Pallid with toil or surfeited with state,"
1521,I.,"Mark how thy fancies, with the vernal rose,"
1522,I.,"Awake, all sweetness, from their long repose;"
1523,I.,"Then turn to ponder o'er the classic page,"
1524,I.,"Traced with the idyls of a greener age,"
1525,I.,And learn the instinct which arose to warm
1526,I.,Art's earliest essay and her simplest form.
1527,I.,
1528,I.,To themes like these her narrow path confined
1529,I.,The first-born impulse moving in the mind;
1530,I.,"In vales unshaken by the trumpet's sound,"
1531,I.,"Where peaceful Labor tills his fertile ground,"
1532,I.,"The silent changes of the rolling years,"
1533,I.,"Marked on the soil or dialled on the spheres,"
1534,I.,"The crested forests and the colored flowers,"
1535,I.,"The dewy grottos and the blushing bowers,--"
1536,I.,"These, and their guardians, who, with liquid names,"
1537,I.,"Strephons and Chloes, melt in mutual flames,"
1538,I.,"Woo the young Muses from their mountain shade,"
1539,I.,To make Arcadias in the lonely glade.
1540,I.,
1541,I.,Nor think they visit only with their smiles
1542,I.,The fabled valleys and Elysian isles;
1543,I.,He who is wearied of his village plain
1544,I.,May roam the Edens of the world in vain.
1545,I.,"'T is not the star-crowned cliff, the cataract's flow,"
1546,I.,"The softer foliage or the greener glow,"
1547,I.,"The lake of sapphire or the spar-hung cave,"
1548,I.,"The brighter sunset or the broader wave,"
1549,I.,Can warm his heart whom every wind has blown
1550,I.,"To every shore, forgetful of his own."
1551,I.,
1552,I.,Home of our childhood! how affection clings
1553,I.,And hovers round thee with her seraph wings!
1554,I.,"Dearer thy hills, though clad in autumn brown,"
1555,I.,Than fairest summits which the cedars crown!
1556,I.,Sweeter the fragrance of thy summer breeze
1557,I.,Than all Arabia breathes along the seas!
1558,I.,"The stranger's gale wafts home the exile's sigh,"
1559,I.,For the heart's temple is its own blue sky!
1560,I.,
1561,I.,"Oh happiest they, whose early love unchanged,"
1562,I.,"Hopes undissolved, and friendship unestranged,"
1563,I.,"Tired of their wanderings, still can deign to see"
1564,I.,"Love, hopes, and friendship, centring all in thee!"
1565,I.,
1566,I.,"And thou, my village! as again I tread"
1567,I.,Amidst thy living and above thy dead;
1568,I.,Though some fair playmates guard with charter  fears
1569,I.,"Their cheeks, grown holy with the lapse of years;"
1570,I.,"Though with the dust some reverend locks may  blend,"
1571,I.,Where life's last mile-stone marks the journey's end;
1572,I.,"On every bud the changing year recalls,"
1573,I.,"The brightening glance of morning memory falls,"
1574,I.,Still following onward as the months unclose
1575,I.,The balmy lilac or the bridal rose;
1576,I.,"And still shall follow, till they sink once more"
1577,I.,"Beneath the snow-drifts of the frozen shore,"
1578,I.,"As when my bark, long tossing in the gale,"
1579,I.,Furled in her port her tempest-rended sail!
1580,I.,
1581,I.,"What shall I give thee? Can a simple lay,"
1582,I.,"Flung on thy bosom like a girl's bouquet,"
1583,I.,"Do more than deck thee for an idle hour,"
1584,I.,"Then fall unheeded, fading like the flower?"
1585,I.,"Yet, when I trod, with footsteps wild and free,"
1586,I.,"The crackling leaves beneath yon linden-tree,"
1587,I.,"Panting from play or dripping from the stream,"
1588,I.,How bright the visions of my boyish dream
1589,I.,"Or, modest Charles, along thy broken edge,"
1590,I.,"Black with soft ooze and fringed with arrowy sedge,"
1591,I.,"As once I wandered in the morning sun,"
1592,I.,"With reeking sandal and superfluous gun,"
1593,I.,"How oft, as Fancy whispered in the gale,"
1594,I.,Thou wast the Avon of her flattering tale!
1595,I.,"Ye hills, whose foliage, fretted on the skies,"
1596,I.,"Prints shadowy arches on their evening dyes,"
1597,I.,How should my song with holiest charm invest
1598,I.,Each dark ravine and forest-lifting crest!
1599,I.,"How clothe in beauty each familiar scene,"
1600,I.,Till all was classic on my native green!
1601,I.,
1602,I.,"As the drained fountain, filled with autumn leaves,"
1603,I.,"The field swept naked of its garnered sheaves,"
1604,I.,"So wastes at noon the promise of our dawn,"
1605,I.,"The springs all choking, and the harvest gone."
1606,I.,
1607,I.,Yet hear the lay of one whose natal star
1608,I.,Still seemed the brightest when it shone afar;
1609,I.,"Whose cheek, grown pallid with ungracious toil,"
1610,I.,Glows in the welcome of his parent soil;
1611,I.,"And ask no garlands sought beyond the tide,"
1612,I.,But take the leaflets gathered at your side.
1613,I.,
1614,I.,
1615,I.,
1616,II.,II.
1617,II.,
1618,II.,"But times were changed; the torch of terror came,"
1619,II.,To light the summits with the beacon's flame;
1620,II.,"The streams ran crimson, the tall mountain pines"
1621,II.,Rose a new forest o'er embattled lines;
1622,II.,"The bloodless sickle lent the warrior's steel,"
1623,II.,The harvest bowed beneath his chariot wheel;
1624,II.,Where late the wood-dove sheltered her repose
1625,II.,The raven waited for the conflict's close;
1626,II.,The cuirassed sentry walked his sleepless round
1627,II.,Where Daphne smiled or Amaryllis frowned;
1628,II.,"Where timid minstrels sung their blushing charms,"
1629,II.,"Some wild Tyrtaeus called aloud, ""To arms!"""
1630,II.,
1631,II.,"When Glory wakes, when fiery spirits leap,"
1632,II.,"Roused by her accents from their tranquil sleep,"
1633,II.,The ray that flashes from the soldier's crest
1634,II.,"Lights, as it glances, in the poet's breast;--"
1635,II.,"Not in pale dreamers, whose fantastic lay"
1636,II.,"Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play,"
1637,II.,"But men, who act the passions they inspire,"
1638,II.,Who wave the sabre as they sweep the lyre!
1639,II.,
1640,II.,"Ye mild enthusiasts, whose pacific frowns"
1641,II.,"Are lost like dew-drops caught in burning towns,"
1642,II.,"Pluck as ye will the radiant plumes of fame,"
1643,II.,Break Caesar's bust to make yourselves a name;
1644,II.,But if your country bares the avenger's blade
1645,II.,"For wrongs unpunished or for debts unpaid,"
1646,II.,"When the roused nation bids her armies form,"
1647,II.,"And screams her eagle through the gathering storm,"
1648,II.,"When from your ports the bannered frigate rides,"
1649,II.,"Her black bows scowling to the crested tides,"
1650,II.,Your hour has past; in vain your feeble cry
1651,II.,As the babe's wailings to the thundering sky!
1652,II.,
1653,II.,Scourge of mankind! with all the dread array
1654,II.,"That wraps in wrath thy desolating way,"
1655,II.,"As the wild tempest wakes the slumbering sea,"
1656,II.,Thou only teachest all that man can be.
1657,II.,Alike thy tocsin has the power to charm
1658,II.,"The toil-knit sinews of the rustic's arm,"
1659,II.,"Or swell the pulses in the poet's veins,"
1660,II.,And bid the nations tremble at his strains.
1661,II.,
1662,II.,"The city slept beneath the moonbeam's glance,"
1663,II.,"Her white walls gleaming through the vines of France,"
1664,II.,"And all was hushed, save where the footsteps fell,"
1665,II.,"On some high tower, of midnight sentinel."
1666,II.,But one still watched; no self-encircled woes
1667,II.,Chased from his lids the angel of repose;
1668,II.,"He watched, he wept, for thoughts of bitter years"
1669,II.,"Bowed his dark lashes, wet with burning tears"
1670,II.,His country's sufferings and her children's shame
1671,II.,Streamed o'er his memory like a forest's flame;
1672,II.,"Each treasured insult, each remembered wrong,"
1673,II.,Rolled through his heart and kindled into song.
1674,II.,His taper faded; and the morning gales
1675,II.,Swept through the world the war-song of Marseilles!
1676,II.,
1677,II.,"Now, while around the smiles of Peace expand,"
1678,II.,And Plenty's wreaths festoon the laughing land;
1679,II.,"While France ships outward her reluctant ore,"
1680,II.,And half our navy basks upon the shore;
1681,II.,From ruder themes our meek-eyed Muses turn
1682,II.,To crown with roses their enamelled urn.
1683,II.,
1684,II.,If e'er again return those awful days
1685,II.,"Whose clouds were crimsoned with the beacon's blaze,"
1686,II.,"Whose grass was trampled by the soldier's heel,"
1687,II.,"Whose tides were reddened round the rushing  keel,"
1688,II.,God grant some lyre may wake a nobler strain
1689,II.,To rend the silence of our tented plain!
1690,II.,"When Gallia's flag its triple fold displays,"
1691,II.,Her marshalled legions peal the Marseillaise;
1692,II.,"When round the German close the war-clouds dim,"
1693,II.,Far through their shadows floats his battle-hymn;
1694,II.,"When, crowned with joy, the camps' of England ring,"
1695,II.,"A thousand voices shout, ""God save the King!"""
1696,II.,"When victory follows with our eagle's glance,"
1697,II.,Our nation's anthem pipes a country dance!
1698,II.,
1699,II.,"Some prouder Muse, when comes the hour at last,"
1700,II.,May shake our hillsides with her bugle-blast;
1701,II.,Not ours the task; but since the lyric dress
1702,II.,"Relieves the statelier with its sprightliness,"
1703,II.,"Hear an old song, which some, perchance, have seen"
1704,II.,In stale gazette or cobwebbed magazine.
1705,II.,There was an hour when patriots dared profane
1706,II.,The mast that Britain strove to bow in vain;
1707,II.,"And one, who listened to the tale of shame,"
1708,II.,"Whose heart still answered to that sacred name,"
1709,II.,Whose eye still followed o'er his country's tides
1710,II.,"Thy glorious flag, our brave Old Ironsides"
1711,II.,"From yon lone attic, on a smiling morn,"
1712,II.,Thus mocked the spoilers with his school-boy scorn.
1713,II.,
1714,II.,
1715,II.,
1716,III.,III.
1717,III.,
1718,III.,"When florid Peace resumed her golden reign,"
1719,III.,"And arts revived, and valleys bloomed again,"
1720,III.,"While War still panted on his-broken blade,"
1721,III.,Once more the Muse her heavenly wing essayed.
1722,III.,"Rude was the song: some ballad, stern and wild,"
1723,III.,Lulled the light slumbers of the soldier's child;
1724,III.,"Or young romancer, with his threatening glance"
1725,III.,"And fearful fables of his bloodless lance,"
1726,III.,"Scared the soft fancy of the clinging girls,"
1727,III.,Whose snowy fingers smoothed his raven curls.
1728,III.,"But when long years the stately form had bent,"
1729,III.,"And faithless Memory her illusions lent,"
1730,III.,So vast the outlines of Tradition grew
1731,III.,"That History wondered at the shapes she drew,"
1732,III.,And veiled at length their too ambitious hues
1733,III.,Beneath the pinions of the Epic Muse.
1734,III.,
1735,III.,Far swept her wing; for stormier days had brought
1736,III.,With darker passions deeper tides of thought.
1737,III.,"The camp's harsh tumult and the conflict's glow,"
1738,III.,"The thrill of triumph and the gasp of woe,"
1739,III.,"The tender parting and the glad return,"
1740,III.,"The festal banquet and the funeral urn,"
1741,III.,And all the drama which at once uprears
1742,III.,"Its spectral shadows through the clash of spears,"
1743,III.,"From camp and field to echoing verse transferred,"
1744,III.,Swelled the proud song that listening nations heard.
1745,III.,Why floats the amaranth in eternal bloom
1746,III.,O'er Ilium's turrets and Achilles' tomb?
1747,III.,Why lingers fancy where the sunbeams smile
1748,III.,On Circe's gardens and Calypso's isle?
1749,III.,Why follows memory to the gate of Troy
1750,III.,Her plumed defender and his trembling boy?
1751,III.,"Lo! the blind dreamer, kneeling on the sand"
1752,III.,To trace these records with his doubtful hand;
1753,III.,"In fabled tones his own emotion flows,"
1754,III.,And other lips repeat his silent woes;
1755,III.,In Hector's infant see the babes that shun
1756,III.,"Those deathlike eyes, unconscious of the sun,"
1757,III.,"Or in his hero hear himself implore,"
1758,III.,"""Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more!"""
1759,III.,
1760,III.,Thus live undying through the lapse of time
1761,III.,The solemn legends of the warrior's clime;
1762,III.,"Like Egypt's pyramid or Paestum's fane,"
1763,III.,They stand the heralds of the voiceless plain.
1764,III.,"Yet not like them, for Time, by slow degrees,"
1765,III.,"Saps the gray stone and wears the embroidered frieze,"
1766,III.,"And Isis sleeps beneath her subject Nile,"
1767,III.,And crumbled Neptune strews his Dorian pile;
1768,III.,"But Art's fair fabric, strengthening as it rears"
1769,III.,"Its laurelled columns through the mist of years,"
1770,III.,As the blue arches of the bending skies
1771,III.,"Still gird the torrent, following as it flies,"
1772,III.,"Spreads, with the surges bearing on mankind,"
1773,III.,Its starred pavilion o'er the tides of mind!
1774,III.,
1775,III.,In vain the patriot asks some lofty lay
1776,III.,To dress in state our wars of yesterday.
1777,III.,"The classic days, those mothers of romance,"
1778,III.,That roused a nation for a woman's glance;
1779,III.,"The age of mystery, with its hoarded power,"
1780,III.,"That girt the tyrant in his storied tower,"
1781,III.,"Have passed and faded like a dream of youth,"
1782,III.,And riper eras ask for history's truth.
1783,III.,
1784,III.,"On other shores, above their mouldering towns,"
1785,III.,"In sullen pomp the tall cathedral frowns,"
1786,III.,"Pride in its aisles and paupers at the door,"
1787,III.,Which feeds the beggars whom it fleeced of yore.
1788,III.,"Simple and frail, our lowly temples throw"
1789,III.,Their slender shadows on the paths below;
1790,III.,"Scarce steal the winds, that sweep his woodland tracks,"
1791,III.,"The larch's perfume from the settler's axe,"
1792,III.,"Ere, like a vision of the morning air,"
1793,III.,His slight--framed steeple marks the house of prayer;
1794,III.,"Its planks all reeking and its paint undried,"
1795,III.,"Its rafters sprouting on the shady side,"
1796,III.,It sheds the raindrops from its shingled eaves
1797,III.,Ere its green brothers once have changed their leaves.
1798,III.,
1799,III.,"Yet Faith's pure hymn, beneath its shelter rude,"
1800,III.,Breathes out as sweetly to the tangled wood
1801,III.,As where the rays through pictured glories pour
1802,III.,On marble shaft and tessellated floor;--
1803,III.,"Heaven asks no surplice round the heart that feels,"
1804,III.,And all is holy where devotion kneels.
1805,III.,Thus on the soil the patriot's knee should bend
1806,III.,Which holds the dust once living to defend;
1807,III.,"Where'er the hireling shrinks before the free,"
1808,III.,"Each pass becomes ""a new Thermopylae""!"
1809,III.,"Where'er the battles of the brave are won,"
1810,III.,"There every mountain ""looks on Marathon""!"
1811,III.,
1812,III.,Our fathers live; they guard in glory still
1813,III.,The grass-grown bastions of the fortressed hill;
1814,III.,"Still ring the echoes of the trampled gorge,"
1815,III.,With _God and Freedom. England and Saint George_!
1816,III.,The royal cipher on the captured gun
1817,III.,Mocks the sharp night-dews and the blistering sun;
1818,III.,"The red-cross banner shades its captor's bust,"
1819,III.,Its folds still loaded with the conflict's dust;
1820,III.,"The drum, suspended by its tattered marge,"
1821,III.,Once rolled and rattled to the Hessian's charge;
1822,III.,"The stars have floated from Britannia's mast,"
1823,III.,The redcoat's trumpets blown the rebel's blast.
1824,III.,
1825,III.,"Point to the summits where the brave have bled,"
1826,III.,Where every village claims its glorious dead;
1827,III.,"Say, when their bosoms met the bayonet's shock,"
1828,III.,Their only corselet was the rustic frock;
1829,III.,"Say, when they mustered to the gathering horn,"
1830,III.,"The titled chieftain curled his lip in scorn,"
1831,III.,"Yet, when their leader bade his lines advance,"
1832,III.,No musket wavered in the lion's glance;
1833,III.,"Say, when they fainted in the forced retreat,"
1834,III.,"They tracked the snow-drifts with their bleeding feet,"
1835,III.,"Yet still their banners, tossing in the blast,"
1836,III.,"Bore Ever Ready, faithful to the last,"
1837,III.,"Through storm and battle, till they waved again"
1838,III.,On Yorktown's hills and Saratoga's plain.
1839,III.,
1840,III.,"Then, if so fierce the insatiate patriot's flame,"
1841,III.,"Truth looks too pale and history seems too tame,"
1842,III.,"Bid him await some new Columbiad's page,"
1843,III.,"To gild the tablets of an iron age,"
1844,III.,"And save his tears, which yet may fall upon"
1845,III.,"Some fabled field, some fancied Washington!"
1846,III.,
1847,III.,
1848,III.,
1849,IV.,IV.
1850,IV.,
1851,IV.,"But once again, from their AEolian cave,"
1852,IV.,The winds of Genius wandered on the wave.
1853,IV.,"Tired of the scenes the timid pencil drew,"
1854,IV.,"Sick of the notes the sounding clarion blew,"
1855,IV.,Sated with heroes who had worn so long
1856,IV.,"The shadowy plumage of historic song,"
1857,IV.,"The new-born poet left the beaten course,"
1858,IV.,To track the passions to their living source.
1859,IV.,
1860,IV.,Then rose the Drama;--and the world admired
1861,IV.,Her varied page with deeper thought inspired
1862,IV.,"Bound to no clime, for Passion's throb is one"
1863,IV.,In Greenland's twilight or in India's sun;
1864,IV.,"Born for no age, for all the thoughts that roll"
1865,IV.,"In the dark vortex of the stormy soul,"
1866,IV.,"Unchained in song, no freezing years can tame;"
1867,IV.,"God gave them birth, and man is still the same."
1868,IV.,"So full on life her magic mirror shone,"
1869,IV.,Her sister Arts paid tribute to her throne;
1870,IV.,"One reared her temple, one her canvas warmed,"
1871,IV.,"And Music thrilled, while Eloquence informed."
1872,IV.,The weary rustic left his stinted task
1873,IV.,"For smiles and tears, the dagger and the mask;"
1874,IV.,"The sage, turned scholar, half forgot his lore,"
1875,IV.,To be the woman he despised before.
1876,IV.,"O'er sense and thought she threw her golden chain,"
1877,IV.,"And Time, the anarch, spares her deathless reign."
1878,IV.,
1879,IV.,"Thus lives Medea, in our tamer age,"
1880,IV.,As when her buskin pressed the Grecian stage;
1881,IV.,Not in the cells where frigid learning delves
1882,IV.,"In Aldine folios mouldering on their shelves,"
1883,IV.,"But breathing, burning in the glittering throng,"
1884,IV.,"Whose thousand bravoes roll untired along,"
1885,IV.,"Circling and spreading through the gilded halls,"
1886,IV.,From London's galleries to San Carlo's walls!
1887,IV.,
1888,IV.,Thus shall he live whose more than mortal name
1889,IV.,Mocks with its ray the pallid torch of Fame;
1890,IV.,So proudly lifted that it seems afar
1891,IV.,"No earthly Pharos, but a heavenly star,"
1892,IV.,"Who, unconfined to Art's diurnal bound,"
1893,IV.,"Girds her whole zodiac in his flaming round,"
1894,IV.,"And leads the passions, like the orb that guides,"
1895,IV.,"From pole to pole, the palpitating tides!"
1896,IV.,
1897,IV.,
1898,IV.,
1899,V.,V.
1900,V.,
1901,V.,"Though round the Muse the robe of song is thrown,"
1902,V.,Think not the poet lives in verse alone.
1903,V.,Long ere the chisel of the sculptor taught
1904,V.,The lifeless stone to mock the living thought;
1905,V.,Long ere the painter bade the canvas glow
1906,V.,With every line the forms of beauty know;
1907,V.,Long ere the iris of the Muses threw
1908,V.,"On every leaf its own celestial hue,"
1909,V.,"In fable's dress the breath of genius poured,"
1910,V.,And warmed the shapes that later times adored.
1911,V.,
1912,V.,Untaught by Science how to forge the keys
1913,V.,That loose the gates of Nature's mysteries;
1914,V.,"Unschooled by Faith, who, with her angel tread,"
1915,V.,"Leads through the labyrinth with a single thread,"
1916,V.,"His fancy, hovering round her guarded tower,"
1917,V.,Rained through its bars like Danae's golden shower.
1918,V.,
1919,V.,He spoke; the sea-nymph answered from her cave
1920,V.,He called; the naiad left her mountain wave
1921,V.,"He dreamed of beauty; lo, amidst his dream,"
1922,V.,"Narcissus, mirrored in the breathless stream;"
1923,V.,"And night's chaste empress, in her bridal play,"
1924,V.,Laughed through the foliage where Endymion lay;
1925,V.,"And ocean dimpled, as the languid swell"
1926,V.,Kissed the red lip of Cytherea's shell.
1927,V.,
1928,V.,"Of power,--Bellona swept the crimson field,"
1929,V.,And blue-eyed Pallas shook her Gorgon shield;
1930,V.,"O'er the hushed waves their mightier monarch drove,"
1931,V.,And Ida trembled to the tread of Jove!
1932,V.,
1933,V.,So every grace that plastic language knows
1934,V.,To nameless poets its perfection owes.
1935,V.,The rough-hewn words to simplest thoughts confined
1936,V.,Were cut and polished in their nicer mind;
1937,V.,"Caught on their edge, imagination's ray"
1938,V.,"Splits into rainbows, shooting far away;--"
1939,V.,"From sense to soul, from soul to sense, it flies,"
1940,V.,And through all nature links analogies;
1941,V.,He who reads right will rarely look upon
1942,V.,A better poet than his lexicon!
1943,V.,
1944,V.,"There is a race which cold, ungenial skies"
1945,V.,"Breed from decay, as fungous growths arise;"
1946,V.,"Though dying fast, yet springing fast again,"
1947,V.,"Which still usurps an unsubstantial reign,"
1948,V.,"With frames too languid for the charms of sense,"
1949,V.,And minds worn down with action too intense;
1950,V.,"Tired of a world whose joys they never knew,"
1951,V.,"Themselves deceived, yet thinking all untrue;"
1952,V.,"Scarce men without, and less than girls within,"
1953,V.,Sick of their life before its cares begin;--
1954,V.,"The dull disease, which drains their feeble hearts,"
1955,V.,"To life's decay some hectic thrill's imparts,"
1956,V.,"And lends a force which, like the maniac's power,"
1957,V.,Pays with blank years the frenzy of an hour.
1958,V.,
1959,V.,"And this is Genius! Say, does Heaven degrade"
1960,V.,"The manly frame, for health, for action made?"
1961,V.,"Break down the sinews, rack the brow with pains,"
1962,V.,"Blanch the right cheek and drain the purple veins,"
1963,V.,"To clothe the mind with more extended sway,"
1964,V.,Thus faintly struggling in degenerate clay?
1965,V.,
1966,V.,"No! gentle maid, too ready to admire,"
1967,V.,"Though false its notes, the pale enthusiast's lyre;"
1968,V.,"If this be genius, though its bitter springs"
1969,V.,"Glowed like the morn beneath Aurora's wings,"
1970,V.,Seek not the source whose sullen bosom feeds
1971,V.,"But fruitless flowers and dark, envenomed weeds."
1972,V.,
1973,V.,"But, if so bright the dear illusion seems,"
1974,V.,"Thou wouldst be partner of thy poet's dreams,"
1975,V.,"And hang in rapture on his bloodless charms,"
1976,V.,"Or die, like Raphael, in his angel arms,"
1977,V.,"Go and enjoy thy blessed lot,--to share"
1978,V.,In Cowper's gloom or Chatterton's despair!
1979,V.,
1980,V.,"Not such were they whom, wandering o'er the waves,"
1981,V.,"I looked to meet, but only found their graves;"
1982,V.,"If friendship's smile, the better part of fame,"
1983,V.,"Should lend my song the only wreath I claim,"
1984,V.,"Whose voice would greet me with a sweeter tone,"
1985,V.,"Whose living hand more kindly press my own,"
1986,V.,"Than theirs,--could Memory, as her silent tread"
1987,V.,"Prints the pale flowers that blossom o'er the dead,"
1988,V.,"Those breathless lips, now closed in peace, restore,"
1989,V.,Or wake those pulses hushed to beat no more?
1990,V.,
1991,V.,"Thou calm, chaste scholar! I can see thee now,"
1992,V.,"The first young laurels on thy pallid brow,"
1993,V.,O'er thy slight figure floating lightly down
1994,V.,"In graceful folds the academic gown,"
1995,V.,On thy curled lip the classic lines that taught
1996,V.,"How nice the mind that sculptured them with thought,"
1997,V.,"And triumph glistening in the clear blue eye,"
1998,V.,"Too bright to live,--but oh, too fair to die!"
1999,V.,
2000,V.,"And thou, dear friend, whom Science still deplores,"
2001,V.,"And Love still mourns, on ocean-severed shores,"
2002,V.,Though the bleak forest twice has bowed with snow
2003,V.,"Since thou wast laid its budding leaves below,"
2004,V.,"Thine image mingles with my closing strain,"
2005,V.,"As when we wandered by the turbid Seine,"
2006,V.,"Both blessed with hopes, which revelled, bright and free,"
2007,V.,On all we longed or all we dreamed to be;
2008,V.,"To thee the amaranth and the cypress fell,--"
2009,V.,And I was spared to breathe this last farewell!
2010,V.,
2011,V.,"But lived there one in unremembered days,"
2012,V.,"Or lives there still, who spurns the poet's bays,"
2013,V.,"Whose fingers, dewy from Castalia's springs,"
2014,V.,"Rest on the lyre, yet scorn to touch the strings?"
2015,V.,Who shakes the senate with the silver tone
2016,V.,The groves of Pindus might have sighed to own?
2017,V.,Have such e'er been? Remember Canning's name!
2018,V.,"Do such still live? Let ""Alaric's Dirge"" proclaim!"
2019,V.,
2020,V.,Immortal Art! where'er the rounded sky
2021,V.,"Bends o'er the cradle where thy children lie,"
2022,V.,"Their home is earth, their herald every tongue"
2023,V.,Whose accents echo to the voice that sung.
2024,V.,One leap of Ocean scatters on the sand
2025,V.,The quarried bulwarks of the loosening land;
2026,V.,One thrill of earth dissolves a century's toil
2027,V.,Strewed like the leaves that vanish in the soil;
2028,V.,"One hill o'erflows, and cities sink below,"
2029,V.,Their marbles splintering in the lava's glow;
2030,V.,"But one sweet tone, scarce whispered to the air,"
2031,V.,From shore to shore the blasts of ages bear;
2032,V.,"One humble name, which oft, perchance, has borne"
2033,V.,"The tyrant's mockery and the courtier's scorn,"
2034,V.,"Towers o'er the dust of earth's forgotten graves,"
2035,V.,"As once, emerging through the waste of waves,"
2036,V.,"The rocky Titan, round whose shattered spear"
2037,V.,Coiled the last whirlpool of the drowning sphere!
2038,V.,
2039,V.,
2040,V.,
