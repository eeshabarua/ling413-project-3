151,SPRING NIGHT,
152,SPRING NIGHT,"THE park is filled with night and fog,"
153,SPRING NIGHT,"The veils are drawn about the world,"
154,SPRING NIGHT,The drowsy lights along the paths
155,SPRING NIGHT,Are dim and pearled.
156,SPRING NIGHT,
157,SPRING NIGHT,"Gold and gleaming the empty streets,"
158,SPRING NIGHT,"Gold and gleaming the misty lake,"
159,SPRING NIGHT,"The mirrored lights like sunken swords,"
160,SPRING NIGHT,Glimmer and shake.
161,SPRING NIGHT,
162,SPRING NIGHT,"Oh, is it not enough to be"
163,SPRING NIGHT,Here with this beauty over me?
164,SPRING NIGHT,"My throat should ache with praise, and I"
165,SPRING NIGHT,Should kneel in joy beneath the sky.
166,SPRING NIGHT,"Oh, beauty are you not enough?"
167,SPRING NIGHT,
168,SPRING NIGHT,Why am I crying after love
169,SPRING NIGHT,"With youth, a singing voice and eyes"
170,SPRING NIGHT,To take earth's wonder with surprise?
171,SPRING NIGHT,"Why have I put off my pride,"
172,SPRING NIGHT,"Why am I unsatisfied,"
173,SPRING NIGHT,I for whom the pensive night
174,SPRING NIGHT,"Binds her cloudy hair with light,"
175,SPRING NIGHT,I for whom all beauty burns
176,SPRING NIGHT,Like incense in a million urns?
177,SPRING NIGHT,"Oh, beauty, are you not enough?"

186,THE FLIGHT,"Lift me up in your love as a light wind lifts a swallow,"
187,THE FLIGHT,Let our flight be far in sun or windy rain--
188,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?
189,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?,
190,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?,"Hold me on your heart as the brave sea holds the foam,"
191,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?,Take me far away to the hills that hide your home;
192,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?,Peace shall thatch the roof and love shall latch the door--
193,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME AGAIN?,
194,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME ONCE MORE?,BUT WHAT IF I HEARD MY FIRST LOVE CALLING ME ONCE MORE?

199,NEW LOVE AND OLD,NEW LOVE AND OLD
200,NEW LOVE AND OLD,
201,NEW LOVE AND OLD,IN my heart the old love
202,NEW LOVE AND OLD,Struggled with the new;
203,NEW LOVE AND OLD,It was ghostly waking
204,NEW LOVE AND OLD,All night thru.
205,NEW LOVE AND OLD,
206,NEW LOVE AND OLD,"Dear things, kind things,"
207,NEW LOVE AND OLD,"That my old love said,"
208,NEW LOVE AND OLD,Ranged themselves reproachfully
209,NEW LOVE AND OLD,Round my bed.
210,NEW LOVE AND OLD,
211,NEW LOVE AND OLD,"But I could not heed them,"
212,NEW LOVE AND OLD,For I seemed to see
213,NEW LOVE AND OLD,The eyes of my new love
214,NEW LOVE AND OLD,Fixed on me.
215,NEW LOVE AND OLD,
216,NEW LOVE AND OLD,"Old love, old love,"
217,NEW LOVE AND OLD,How can I be true?
218,NEW LOVE AND OLD,Shall I be faithless to myself
219,NEW LOVE AND OLD,Or to you?

223,THE LOOK,THE LOOK
224,THE LOOK,
225,THE LOOK,"STREPHON kissed me in the spring,"
226,THE LOOK,"Robin in the fall,"
227,THE LOOK,But Colin only looked at me
228,THE LOOK,And never kissed at all.
229,THE LOOK,
230,THE LOOK,"Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,"
231,THE LOOK,"Robin's lost in play,"
232,THE LOOK,But the kiss in Colin's eyes
233,THE LOOK,Haunts me night and day.

240,SPRING,"IN Central Park the lovers sit,"
241,SPRING,"On every hilly path they stroll,"
242,SPRING,"Each thinks his love is infinite,"
243,SPRING,And crowns his soul.
244,SPRING,
245,SPRING,"But we are cynical and wise,"
246,SPRING,"We walk a careful foot apart,"
247,SPRING,You make a little joke that tries
248,SPRING,To hide your heart.
249,SPRING,
250,SPRING,"Give over, we have laughed enough;"
251,SPRING,"Oh dearest and most foolish friend,"
252,SPRING,Why do you wage a war with love
253,SPRING,To lose your battle in the end?

259,THE LIGHTED WINDOW,
260,HE SAID:,HE SAID:
261,HE SAID:,"""In the winter dusk"
262,HE SAID:,"When the pavements were gleaming with rain,"
263,HE SAID:,I walked thru a dingy street
264,HE SAID:,"Hurried, harassed,"
265,HE SAID:,Thinking of all my problems that never are
266,HE SAID:,solved.
267,HE SAID:,"Suddenly out of the mist, a flaring gas-jet"
268,HE SAID:,Shone from a huddled shop.
269,HE SAID:,I saw thru the bleary window
270,HE SAID:,A mass of playthings:
271,HE SAID:,"False-faces hung on strings,"
272,HE SAID:,"Valentines, paper and tinsel,"
273,HE SAID:,"Tops of scarlet and green,"
274,HE SAID:,"Candy, marbles, jacks--"
275,HE SAID:,A confusion of color
276,HE SAID:,Pathetically gaudy and cheap.
277,HE SAID:,All of my boyhood
278,HE SAID:,Rushed back.
279,HE SAID:,Once more these things were treasures
280,HE SAID:,Wildly desired.
281,HE SAID:,"With covetous eyes I looked again at the marbles,"
282,HE SAID:,"The precious agates, the pee-wees, the chinies--"
283,HE SAID:,Then I passed on.
284,HE SAID:,
285,HE SAID:,"In the winter dusk,"
286,HE SAID:,The pavements were gleaming with rain;
287,HE SAID:,There in the lighted window
288,HE SAID:,"I left my boyhood."""

290,HE SAID:,
291,HE SAID:,
292,HE SAID:,
293,THE KISS,THE KISS
294,THE KISS,
295,THE KISS,BEFORE YOU kissed me only winds of heaven
296,THE KISS,"Had kissed me, and the tenderness of rain--"
297,THE KISS,"Now you have come, how can I care for kisses"
298,THE KISS,Like theirs again?
299,THE KISS,
300,THE KISS,"I sought the sea, she sent her winds to meet me,"
301,THE KISS,They surged about me singing of the south--
302,THE KISS,I turned my head away to keep still holy
303,THE KISS,Your kiss upon my mouth.
304,THE KISS,
305,THE KISS,And swift sweet rains of shining April weather
306,THE KISS,Found not my lips where living kisses are;
307,THE KISS,I bowed my head lest they put out my glory
308,THE KISS,As rain puts out a star.
309,THE KISS,
310,THE KISS,"I am my love's and he is mine forever,"
311,THE KISS,Sealed with a seal and safe forevermore--
312,THE KISS,Think you that I could let a beggar enter
313,THE KISS,Where a king stood before?
314,THE KISS,
315,THE KISS,
316,THE KISS,
317,THE KISS,
318,SWANS,SWANS
319,SWANS,
320,SWANS,"NIGHT is over the park, and a few brave stars"
321,SWANS,"Look on the lights that link it with chains of gold,"
322,SWANS,The lake bears up their reflection in broken bars
323,SWANS,That seem too heavy for tremulous water to hold.
324,SWANS,
325,SWANS,"We watch the swans that sleep in a shadowy place,"
326,SWANS,And now and again one wakes and uplifts its head;
327,SWANS,How still you are--your gaze is on my face--
328,SWANS,We watch the swans and never a word is said.

332,THE OLD MAID,THE OLD MAID
333,THE OLD MAID,
334,THE OLD MAID,"I SAW her in a Broadway car,"
335,THE OLD MAID,The woman I might grow to be;
336,THE OLD MAID,I felt my lover look at her
337,THE OLD MAID,And then turn suddenly to me.
338,THE OLD MAID,
339,THE OLD MAID,Her hair was dull and drew no light
340,THE OLD MAID,And yet its color was as mine;
341,THE OLD MAID,Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
342,THE OLD MAID,Tho' love had never made them shine.
343,THE OLD MAID,
344,THE OLD MAID,"Her body was a thing grown thin,"
345,THE OLD MAID,Hungry for love that never came;
346,THE OLD MAID,Her soul was frozen in the dark
347,THE OLD MAID,Unwarmed forever by love's flame.
348,THE OLD MAID,
349,THE OLD MAID,I felt my lover look at her
350,THE OLD MAID,"And then turn suddenly to me,--"
351,THE OLD MAID,His eyes were magic to defy
352,THE OLD MAID,The woman I shall never be.

356,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER
357,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,
358,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"VIVID with love, eager for greater beauty"
359,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Out of the night we come
360,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Into the corridor, brilliant and warm."
361,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"A metal door slides open,"
362,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,And the lift receives us.
363,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Swiftly, with sharp unswerving flight"
364,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"The car shoots upward,"
365,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"And the air, swirling and angry,"
366,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Howls like a hundred devils.
367,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Past the maze of trim bronze doors,"
368,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Steadily we ascend.
369,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,I cling to you
370,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Conscious of the chasm under us,"
371,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,And a terrible whirring deafens my ears.
372,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,
373,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,The flight is ended.
374,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,
375,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,We pass thru a door leading onto the ledge--
376,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Wind, night and space"
377,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Oh terrible height
378,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Why have we sought you?
379,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Oh bitter wind with icy invisible wings
380,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Why do you beat us?
381,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Why would you bear us away?
382,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"We look thru the miles of air,"
383,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"The cold blue miles between us and the city,"
384,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Over the edge of eternity we look
385,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"On all the lights,"
386,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,A thousand times more numerous than the stars;
387,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Oh lines and loops of light in unwound chains
388,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,That mark for miles and miles
389,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,The vast black mazy cobweb of the streets;
390,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Near us clusters and splashes of living gold
391,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,That change far off to bluish steel
392,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Where the fragile lights on the Jersey shore
393,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Tremble like drops of wind-stirred dew.
394,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,The strident noises of the city
395,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Floating up to us
396,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Are hallowed into whispers.
397,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Ferries cross thru the darkness
398,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Weaving a golden thread into the night,"
399,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Their whistles weird shadows of sound.
400,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,
401,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"We feel the millions of humanity beneath us,--"
402,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"The warm millions, moving under the roofs,"
403,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Consumed by their own desires;
404,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Preparing food,"
405,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Sobbing alone in a garret,"
406,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"With burning eyes bending over a needle,"
407,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Aimlessly reading the evening paper,"
408,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Dancing in the naked light of the caf&eacute;,"
409,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Laying out the dead,"
410,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Bringing a child to birth--
411,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"The sorrow, the torpor, the bitterness, the frail joy"
412,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Come up to us
413,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Like a cold fog wrapping us round.
414,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Oh in a hundred years
415,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Not one of these blood-warm bodies
416,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,But will be worthless as clay.
417,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"The anguish, the torpor, the toil"
418,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Will have passed to other millions
419,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Consumed by the same desires.
420,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Ages will come and go,"
421,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Darkness will blot the lights
422,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,And the tower will be laid on the earth.
423,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,The sea will remain
424,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Black and unchanging,"
425,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,The stars will look down
426,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Brilliant and unconcerned.
427,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,
428,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Beloved,"
429,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Tho' sorrow, futility, defeat"
430,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,"Surround us,"
431,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,They cannot bear us down.
432,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Here on the abyss of eternity
433,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Love has crowned us
434,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,For a moment
435,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,Victors.
436,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,
437,FROM THE WOOLWORTH TOWER,

439,AT NIGHT,AT NIGHT
440,AT NIGHT,
441,AT NIGHT,"WE are apart; the city grows quiet between us,"
442,AT NIGHT,"She hushes herself, for midnight makes heavy her eyes,"
443,AT NIGHT,"The tangle of traffic is ended, the cars are empty,"
444,AT NIGHT,"Five streets divide us, and on them the moonlight lies."
445,AT NIGHT,
446,AT NIGHT,"Oh are you asleep, or lying awake, my lover?"
447,AT NIGHT,"Open your dreams to my love and your heart to my words,"
448,AT NIGHT,"I send you my thoughts-the air between us is laden,"
449,AT NIGHT,"My thoughts fly in at your window, a flock of wild birds."

454,THE YEARS,THE YEARS
455,THE YEARS,
456,THE YEARS,TO-NIGHT I close my eyes and see
457,THE YEARS,A strange procession passing me--
458,THE YEARS,The years before I saw your face
459,THE YEARS,Go by me with a wistful grace;
460,THE YEARS,"They pass, the sensitive shy years,"
461,THE YEARS,"As one who strives to dance, half blind with tears."
462,THE YEARS,
463,THE YEARS,The years went by and never knew
464,THE YEARS,That each one brought me nearer you;
465,THE YEARS,Their path was narrow and apart
466,THE YEARS,And yet it led me to your heart--
467,THE YEARS,"Oh sensitive shy years, oh lonely years,"
468,THE YEARS,That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears.
469,THE YEARS,
470,THE YEARS,
471,THE YEARS,
472,THE YEARS,
473,PEACE,PEACE
474,PEACE,
475,PEACE,PEACE flows into me
476,PEACE,AS the tide to the pool by the shore;
477,PEACE,"It is mine forevermore,"
478,PEACE,It ebbs not back like the sea.
479,PEACE,
480,PEACE,I am the pool of blue
481,PEACE,That worships the vivid sky;
482,PEACE,"My hopes were heaven-high,"
483,PEACE,They are all fulfilled in you.
484,PEACE,
485,PEACE,I am the pool of gold
486,PEACE,"When sunset burns and dies,--"
487,PEACE,"You are my deepening skies,"
488,PEACE,Give me your stars to hold.

494,APRIL,
495,APRIL,"THE roofs are shining from the rain,"
496,APRIL,"The sparrows twitter as they fly,"
497,APRIL,And with a windy April grace
498,APRIL,The little clouds go by.
499,APRIL,
500,APRIL,Yet the back-yards are bare and brown
501,APRIL,With only one unchanging tree--
502,APRIL,I could not be so sure of Spring
503,APRIL,Save that it sings in me.

510,COME,"COME, when the pale moon like a petal"
511,COME,"Floats in the pearly dusk of spring,"
512,COME,"Come with arms outstretched to take me,"
513,COME,Come with lips pursed up to cling.
514,COME,
515,COME,"Come, for life is a frail moth flying"
516,COME,"Caught in the web of the years that pass,"
517,COME,"And soon we two, so warm and eager"
518,COME,Will be as the gray stones in the grass.

526,MOODS,Too tired for singing mirth--
527,MOODS,"Oh, be the green fields calling,"
528,MOODS,"Oh, be for me the earth!"
529,MOODS,I am the brown bird pining

1057,IN A SUBWAY STATION,And suddenly I turned and saw again
1058,IN A SUBWAY STATION,"The gleaming curve of tracks, the bridge above--"
1059,IN A SUBWAY STATION,"They were burned deep into my heart before,"
1060,IN A SUBWAY STATION,"The night I watched them to avoid your eyes,"
1061,IN A SUBWAY STATION,"When you were saying, ""Oh, look up at me!"""
1062,IN A SUBWAY STATION,"When you were saying, ""Will you never love me?"""
1063,IN A SUBWAY STATION,And when I answered with a lie. Oh then

1462,THE MOTHER OF A POET,
1463,THE MOTHER OF A POET,I love to think that never tears at night
1464,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Have made her eyes less bright;
1465,THE MOTHER OF A POET,That all her girlhood thru
1466,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Never a cry of love made over-tense
1467,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Her voice's innocence;
1468,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"That in her hands have lain,"
1469,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Flowers beaten by the rain,"
1470,THE MOTHER OF A POET,And little birds before they learned to sing
1471,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Drowned in the sudden ecstasy of spring.
1472,THE MOTHER OF A POET,
1473,THE MOTHER OF A POET,I love to think that with a wistful wonder
1474,THE MOTHER OF A POET,She held her baby warm against her breast;
1475,THE MOTHER OF A POET,That never any fear awoke whereunder
1476,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"She shuddered at her gift, or trembled lest"
1477,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Thru the great doors of birth
1478,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Here to a windy earth
1479,THE MOTHER OF A POET,She lured from heaven a half-unwilling guest.
1480,THE MOTHER OF A POET,
1481,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"She caught and kept his first vague flickering smile,"
1482,THE MOTHER OF A POET,The faint upleaping of his spirit's fire;
1483,THE MOTHER OF A POET,And for a long sweet while
1484,THE MOTHER OF A POET,In her was all he asked of earth or heaven--
1485,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"But in the end how far,"
1486,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Past every shaken star,"
1487,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Should leap at last that arrow-like desire,"
1488,THE MOTHER OF A POET,His full-grown manhood's keen
1489,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Ardor toward the unseen
1490,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Dark mystery beyond the Pleiads seven.
1491,THE MOTHER OF A POET,And in her heart she heard
1492,THE MOTHER OF A POET,His first dim-spoken word--
1493,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"She only of them all could understand,"
1494,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Flushing to feel at last
1495,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"The silence over-past,"
1496,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Thrilling as tho' her hand had touched God's hand.
1497,THE MOTHER OF A POET,But in the end how many words
1498,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Winged on a flight she could not follow,"
1499,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Farther than skyward lark or swallow,"
1500,THE MOTHER OF A POET,His lips should free to lands she never knew;
1501,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Braver than white sea-faring birds
1502,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"With a fearless melody,"
1503,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Flying over a shining sea,"
1504,THE MOTHER OF A POET,A star-white song between the blue and blue.
1505,THE MOTHER OF A POET,
1506,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Oh I have seen a lake as clear and fair
1507,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"As it were molten air,"
1508,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Lifting a lily upward to the sun.
1509,THE MOTHER OF A POET,How should the water know the glowing heart
1510,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"That ever to the heaven lifts its fire,"
1511,THE MOTHER OF A POET,A golden and unchangeable desire?
1512,THE MOTHER OF A POET,The water only knows
1513,THE MOTHER OF A POET,The faint and rosy glows
1514,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Of under-petals, opening apart."
1515,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Yet in the soul of earth,"
1516,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Deep in the primal ground,"
1517,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Its searching roots are wound,"
1518,THE MOTHER OF A POET,And centuries have struggled toward its birth.
1519,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"So, in the man who sings,"
1520,THE MOTHER OF A POET,All of the voiceless horde
1521,THE MOTHER OF A POET,From the cold dawn of things
1522,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Have their reward;
1523,THE MOTHER OF A POET,All in whose pulses ran
1524,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Blood that is his at last,"
1525,THE MOTHER OF A POET,From the first stooping man
1526,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Far in the winnowed past.
1527,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Out of the tumult of their love and mating
1528,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Each one created, seeing life was good--"
1529,THE MOTHER OF A POET,"Dumb, till at last the song that they were waiting"
1530,THE MOTHER OF A POET,Breaks like brave April thru a wintry wood.

2174,FROM THE SEA,Nor touch me. Only stand and watch awhile
2175,FROM THE SEA,The blue unbroken circle of the sea.
2176,FROM THE SEA,Look far away and let me ease my heart
2177,FROM THE SEA,Of words that beat in it with broken wing.

2187,FROM THE SEA,Altho' I longed to kneel to you that night
2188,FROM THE SEA,You looked at me with ever-calling eyes.
2189,FROM THE SEA,Was I not calm?  And if you guessed my love
2190,FROM THE SEA,"You thought it something delicate and free,"
2191,FROM THE SEA,"Soft as the sound of fir-trees in the wind,"
2192,FROM THE SEA,Fleeting as phosphorescent stars in foam.

2194,FROM THE SEA,"Bending my thoughts before it, and I strove"
2195,FROM THE SEA,"To say too little lest I say too much,"
2196,FROM THE SEA,And from my eyes to drive love's happy shame.

2204,FROM THE SEA,"You stand forever, nearer God than I,"

2212,FROM THE SEA,"My wistful, far-off singing touched with tears,"
2213,FROM THE SEA,"Know that I sang for you alone to hear,"
2214,FROM THE SEA,And that I wondered if the wind would bring
2215,FROM THE SEA,To him who tuned my heart its distant song.
2216,FROM THE SEA,So might a woman who in loneliness
2217,FROM THE SEA,"Had borne a child, dreaming of days to come,"
2218,FROM THE SEA,Wonder if it would please its father's eyes.
2219,FROM THE SEA,"But long before I ever heard your name,"
2220,FROM THE SEA,Always the undertone's unchanging note
2221,FROM THE SEA,"In all my singing had prefigured you,"
2222,FROM THE SEA,Foretold you as a spark foretells a flame.
2223,FROM THE SEA,Yet I was free as an untethered cloud
2224,FROM THE SEA,"In the great space between the sky and sea,"
2225,FROM THE SEA,And might have blown before the wind of joy
2226,FROM THE SEA,Like a bright banner woven by the sun.
2227,FROM THE SEA,I did not know the longing in the night--
2228,FROM THE SEA,You who have waked me cannot give me sleep.
2229,FROM THE SEA,"All things in all the world can rest, but I,"
2230,FROM THE SEA,Even the smooth brief respite of a wave
2231,FROM THE SEA,"When it gives up its broken crown of foam,"
2232,FROM THE SEA,Even that little rest I may not have.
2233,FROM THE SEA,"And yet all quiet loves of friends, all joy"
2234,FROM THE SEA,In all the piercing beauty of the world
2235,FROM THE SEA,"I would give up--go blind forevermore,"
2236,FROM THE SEA,Rather than have God blot from out my soul
2237,FROM THE SEA,Remembrance of your voice that said my name.
2238,FROM THE SEA,
2239,FROM THE SEA,"For us no starlight stilled the April fields,"
2240,FROM THE SEA,"No birds awoke in darkling trees for us,"

2242,FROM THE SEA,"Felt in our feet the singing fire of spring,"
2243,FROM THE SEA,And in our path we left a trail of light

2412,XI,With laughter light as spray?
2413,XI,
2414,XI,Yet say what words you will
2415,XI,The day that I come home;
2416,XI,I shall hear the whole deep ocean
2417,XI,Beating under the foam.

2433,I,"MIDNIGHT, and in the darkness not a sound,"
2434,I,"So, with hushed breathing, sleeps the autumn night;"
2435,I,"Only the white immortal stars shall know,"
2436,I,"Here in the house with the low-lintelled door,"
2437,I,"How, for the last time, I have lit the lamp."
2438,I,"I think you are not wholly careless now,"
2439,I,"Walls that have sheltered me so many an hour,"
2440,I,"Bed that has brought me ecstasy and sleep,"
2441,I,Floors that have borne me when a gale of joy
2442,I,Lifted my soul and made me half a god.
2443,I,Farewell!  Across the threshold many feet
2444,I,"Shall pass, but never Sappho's feet again."
2445,I,Girls shall come in whom love has made aware
2446,I,"Of all their swaying beauty--they shall sing,"
2447,I,"But never Sappho's voice, like golden fire,"
2448,I,Shall seek for heaven thru your echoing rafters.
2449,I,There shall be swallows bringing back the spring
2450,I,"Over the long blue meadows of the sea,"
2451,I,"And south-wind playing on the reeds of rain,"
2452,I,"But never Sappho's whisper in the night,"
2453,I,Never her love-cry when the lover comes.
2454,I,Farewell!   I close the door and make it fast.
2455,I,
2456,I,"The little street lies meek beneath the moon,"
2457,I,"Running, as rivers run, to meet the sea."
2458,I,I too go seaward and shall not return.
2459,I,"Oh garlands on the doorposts that I pass,"
2460,I,"Woven of asters and of autumn leaves,"
2461,I,"I make a prayer for you: Cypris be kind,"
2462,I,That every lover may be given love.
2463,I,I shall not hasten lest the paving stones
2464,I,Should echo with my sandals and awake
2465,I,"Those who are warm beneath the cloak of sleep,"
2466,I,"Lest they should rise and see me and should say,"
2467,I,"""Whither goes Sappho lonely in the night?"""
2468,I,"Whither goes Sappho?  Whither all men go,"
2469,I,"But they go driven, straining back with fear,"
2470,I,And Sappho goes as lightly as a leaf
2471,I,Blown from brown autumn forests to the sea.
2472,I,
2473,I,"Here on the rock Zeus lifted from the waves,"
2474,I,"I shall await the waking of the dawn,"
2475,I,Lying beneath the weight of dark as one
2476,I,"Lies breathless, till the lover shall awake."
2477,I,And with the sun the sea shall cover me--
2478,I,I shall be less than the dissolving foam
2479,I,Murmuring and melting on the ebbing tide;
2480,I,"I shall be less than spindrift, less than shells;"
2481,I,"And yet I shall be greater than the gods,"
2482,I,For destiny no more can bow my soul
2483,I,As rain bows down the watch-fires on the hills.
2484,I,"Yes, if my soul escape it shall aspire"
2485,I,To the white heaven as flame that has its will.
2486,I,"I go not bitterly, not dumb with pain,"
2487,I,Not broken by the ache of love--I go
2488,I,As one grown tired lies down and hopes to sleep.
2489,I,"Yet they shall say: ""It was for Cercolas;"
2490,I,"She died because she could not bear her love."""
2491,I,They shall remember how we used to walk
2492,I,Here on the cliff beneath the oleanders
2493,I,"In the long limpid twilight of the spring,"
2494,I,"Looking toward Lemnos, where the amber sky"
2495,I,Was pierced with the faint arrow of a star.
2496,I,How should they know the wind of a new beauty
2497,I,Sweeping my soul had winnowed it with song?
2498,I,"I have been glad tho' love should come or go,"
2499,I,"Happy as trees that find a wind to sway them,"
2500,I,Happy again when it has left them rest.
2501,I,"Others shall say, ""Grave Dica wrought her death."
2502,I,"She would not lift her lips to take a kiss,"
2503,I,Or ever lift her eyes to take a smile.
2504,I,She was a pool the winter paves with ice
2505,I,That the wild hunter in the hills must leave
2506,I,"With thirst unslaked in the brief southward sun."""
2507,I,"Ah Dica, it is not for thee I go;"
2508,I,"And not for Phaon, tho' his ship lifts sail"
2509,I,Here in the windless harbor for the south.
2510,I,"Oh, darkling deities that guard the Nile,"
2511,I,Watch over one whose gods are far away.
2512,I,"Egypt, be kind to him, his eyes are deep--"
2513,I,Yet they are wrong who say it was for him.
2514,I,How should they know that Sappho lived and died
2515,I,"Faithful to love, not faithful to the lover,"
2516,I,"Never transfused and lost in what she loved,"
2517,I,Never so wholly loving nor at peace.
2518,I,"I asked for something greater than I found,"
2519,I,"And every time that love has made me weep,"
2520,I,I have rejoiced that love could be so strong;
2521,I,For I have stood apart and watched my soul
2522,I,"Caught in the gust of passion, as a bird"
2523,I,With baffled wings against the dusty whirlwind
2524,I,Struggles and frees itself to find the sky.
2525,I,It is not for a single god I go;
2526,I,I have grown weary of the winds of heaven.
2527,I,I will not be a reed to hold the sound
2528,I,"Of whatsoever breath the gods may blow,"
2529,I,Turning my torment into music for them.
2530,I,"They gave me life; the gift was bountiful,"
2531,I,"I lived with the swift singing strength of fire,"
2532,I,Seeking for beauty as a flame for fuel--
2533,I,Beauty in all things and in every hour.
2534,I,The gods have given life--I gave them song;
2535,I,The debt is paid and now I turn to go.
2536,I,
2537,I,"The breath of dawn blows the stars out like lamps,"
2538,I,"There is a rim of silver on the sea,"
2539,I,"As one grown tired who hopes to sleep, I go."
2540,I,
2541,I,
2542,II,II
2543,II,
2544,II,"Oh Litis, little slave, why will you sleep?"
2545,II,These long Egyptian noons bend down your head
2546,II,Bowed like the yarrow with a yellow bee.
2547,II,"There, lift your eyes no man has ever kindled,"
2548,II,Dark eyes that wait like faggots for the fire.
2549,II,See how the temple's solid square of shade
2550,II,"Points north to Lesbos, and the splendid sea"
2551,II,"That you have never seen, oh evening-eyed."
2552,II,Yet have you never wondered what the Nile
2553,II,"Is seeking always, restless and wild with spring"
2554,II,"And no less in the winter, seeking still?"
2555,II,How shall I tell you? Can you think of fields
2556,II,"Greater than Gods could till, more blue than night"
2557,II,Sown over with the stars; and delicate
2558,II,With filmy nets of foam that come and go?
2559,II,It is more cruel and more compassionate
2560,II,Than harried earth. It takes with unconcern
2561,II,"And quick forgetting, rapture of the rain"
2562,II,"And agony of thunder, the moon's white"
2563,II,"Soft-garmented virginity, and then"
2564,II,The insatiable ardor of the sun.
2565,II,"And me it took. But there is one more strong,"
2566,II,"Love, that came laughing from the elder seas,"
2567,II,"The Cyprian, the mother of the world;"
2568,II,She gave me love who only asked for death--
2569,II,I who had seen much sorrow in men's eyes
2570,II,And in my own too sorrowful a fire.
2571,II,"I was a sister of the stars, and yet"
2572,II,Shaken with pain; sister of birds and yet
2573,II,The wings that bore my soul were very tired.
2574,II,I watched the careless spring too many times
2575,II,Light her green torches in a hungry wind;
2576,II,"Too many times I watched them flare, and then"
2577,II,Fall to forsaken embers in the autumn.
2578,II,And I was sick of all things--even song.
2579,II,"In the dull autumn dawn I turned to death,"
2580,II,"Buried my living body in the sea,"
2581,II,The strong cold sea that takes and does not give--
2582,II,"But there is one more strong, the Cyprian."
2583,II,"Litis, to wake from sleep and find your eyes"
2584,II,"Met in their first fresh upward gaze by love,"
2585,II,"Filled with love's happy shame from other eyes,"
2586,II,Dazzled with tenderness and drowned in light
2587,II,"As tho' you looked unthinking at the sun,"
2588,II,"Oh Litis, that is joy!  But if you came"
2589,II,"Not from the sunny shallow pool of sleep,"
2590,II,"But from the sea of death, the strangling sea"
2591,II,"Of night and nothingness, and waked to find"
2592,II,"Love looking down upon you, glad and still,"
2593,II,"Strange and yet known forever, that is peace."
2594,II,So did he lean above me. Not a word
2595,II,He spoke; I only heard the morning sea
2596,II,"Singing against his happy ship, the keen"
2597,II,And straining joy of wind-awakened sails
2598,II,"And songs of mariners, and in myself"
2599,II,The precious pain of arms that held me fast.
2600,II,They warmed the cold sea out of all my blood;
2601,II,"I slept, feeling his eyes above my sleep."
2602,II,"There on the ship with wines and olives laden,"
2603,II,"Led by the stars to far invisible ports,"
2604,II,"Egypt and islands of the inner seas,"
2605,II,"Love came to me, and Cercolas was love."
2606,II,
2607,II,"III &sup1;         &sup1; From "" Helen of Troy and Other Poems."""
2608,II,
2609,II,"The twilight's inner flame grows blue and deep,"
2610,II,"And in my Lesbos, over leagues of sea,"
2611,II,The temples glimmer moon-wise in the trees.
2612,II,Twilight has veiled the little flower-face
2613,II,"Here on my heart, but still the night is kind"
2614,II,And leaves her warm sweet weight against my breast.
2615,II,Am I that Sappho who would run at dusk
2616,II,Along the surges creeping up the shore
2617,II,"When tides came in to ease the hungry beach,"
2618,II,"And running, running till the night was black,"
2619,II,Would fall forespent upon the chilly sand
2620,II,And quiver with the winds from off the sea?
2621,II,Ah quietly the shingle waits the tides
2622,II,"Whose waves are stinging kisses, but to me"
2623,II,"Love brought no peace, nor darkness any rest."
2624,II,I crept and touched the foam with fevered hands
2625,II,"And cried to Love, from whom the sea is sweet,"
2626,II,From whom the sea is bitterer than death.
2627,II,"Ah, Aphrodite, if I sing no more"
2628,II,"To thee, God's daughter, powerful as God,"
2629,II,It is that thou hast made my life too sweet
2630,II,To hold the added sweetness of a song.
2631,II,"There is a quiet at the heart of love,"
2632,II,And I have pierced the pain and come to peace
2633,II,"I hold my peace, my Cle&iuml;s, on my heart;"
2634,II,And softer than a little wild bird's wing
2635,II,Are kisses that she pours upon my mouth.
2636,II,Ah never any more when spring like fire
2637,II,"Will flicker in the newly opened leaves,"
2638,II,Shall I steal forth to seek for solitude
2639,II,"Beyond the lure of light Alcaeus' lyre,"
2640,II,Beyond the sob that stilled Erinna's voice.
2641,II,"Ah, never with a throat that aches with song,"
2642,II,"Beneath the white uncaring sky of spring,"
2643,II,Shall I go forth to hide awhile from Love
2644,II,The quiver and the crying of my heart.
2645,II,Still I remember how I strove to flee
2646,II,"The love-note of the birds, and bowed my head"
2647,II,"To hurry faster, but upon the ground"
2648,II,"I saw two wing&egrave;d shadows side by side,"
2649,II,And all the world's spring passion stifled me.
2650,II,"Ah, Love there is no fleeing from thy might,"
2651,II,"No lonely place where thou hast never trod,"
2652,II,No desert thou hast left uncarpeted
2653,II,With flowers that spring beneath thy perfect feet.
2654,II,In many guises didst thou come to me;
2655,II,"I saw thee by the maidens while they danced,"
2656,II,"Phaon allured me with a look of thine,"
2657,II,"In Anactoria I knew thy grace,"
2658,II,I looked at Cercolas and saw thine eyes;
2659,II,"But never wholly, soul and body mine,"
2660,II,Didst thou bid any love me as I loved.
2661,II,Now have I found the peace that fled from me;
2662,II,"Close, close against my heart I hold my world."
2663,II,"Ah, Love that made my life a Iyric cry,"
2664,II,"Ah, Love that tuned my lips to Iyres of thine,"
2665,II,"I taught the world thy music, now alone"
2666,II,I sing for one who falls asleep to hear.
