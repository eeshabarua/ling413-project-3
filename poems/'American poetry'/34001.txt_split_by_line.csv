130,SUMMONS,SUMMONS
131,SUMMONS,
132,SUMMONS,"The eager night and the impetuous winds,"
133,SUMMONS,"The hints and whispers of a thousand lures,"
134,SUMMONS,And all the swift persuasion of the Spring
135,SUMMONS,"Surged from the stars and stones, and swept me on..."
136,SUMMONS,"The smell of honeysuckles, keen and clear,"
137,SUMMONS,"Startled and shook me, with the sudden thrill"
138,SUMMONS,Of some well-known but half-forgotten voice.
139,SUMMONS,"A slender stream became a naked sprite,"
140,SUMMONS,"Flashed around curious bends, and winked at me"
141,SUMMONS,"Beyond the turns, alert and mischievous."
142,SUMMONS,"A saffron moon, dangling among the trees,"
143,SUMMONS,"Seemed like a toy balloon caught in the boughs,"
144,SUMMONS,Flung there in sport by some too-mirthful breeze...
145,SUMMONS,"And as it hung there, vivid and unreal,"
146,SUMMONS,The whole world's lethargy was brushed away;
147,SUMMONS,The night kept tugging at my torpid mood
148,SUMMONS,And tore it into shreds.  A warm air blew
149,SUMMONS,My wintry slothfulness beyond the stars;
150,SUMMONS,And over all indifference there streamed
151,SUMMONS,A myriad urges in one rushing wave...
152,SUMMONS,"Touched with the lavish miracles of earth,"
153,SUMMONS,I felt the brave persistence of the grass;
154,SUMMONS,"The far desire of rivulets; the keen,"
155,SUMMONS,Unconquerable fervor of the thrush;
156,SUMMONS,The endless labors of the patient worm;
157,SUMMONS,The lichen's strength; the prowess of the ant;
158,SUMMONS,The constancy of flowers; the blind belief
159,SUMMONS,Of ivy climbing slowly toward the sun;
160,SUMMONS,The eternal struggles and eternal deaths--
161,SUMMONS,And yet the groping faith of every root!
162,SUMMONS,Out of old graves arose the cry of life;
163,SUMMONS,Out of the dying came the deathless call.
164,SUMMONS,"And, thrilling with a new sweet restlessness,"
165,SUMMONS,The thing that was my boyhood woke in me--
166,SUMMONS,"Dear, foolish fragments made me strong again;"
167,SUMMONS,"Valiant adventures, dreams of those to come,"
168,SUMMONS,"And all the vague, heroic hopes of youth,"
169,SUMMONS,"With fresh abandon, like a fearless laugh,"
170,SUMMONS,Leaped up to face the heaven's unconcern...
171,SUMMONS,
172,SUMMONS,And then--veil upon veil was torn aside--
173,SUMMONS,"Stars, like a host of merry girls and boys,"
174,SUMMONS,"Danced gaily 'round me, plucking at my hand;"
175,SUMMONS,"The night, scorning its ancient mystery,"
176,SUMMONS,Leaned down and pressed new courage in my heart;
177,SUMMONS,"The hermit thrush, throbbing with more than Song,"
178,SUMMONS,Sang with a happy challenge to the skies;
179,SUMMONS,"Love, and the faces of a world of children,"
180,SUMMONS,Swept like a conquering army through my blood--
181,SUMMONS,"And Beauty, rising out of all its forms,"
182,SUMMONS,"Beauty, the passion of the universe,"
183,SUMMONS,"Flamed with its joy, a thing too great for tears."
184,SUMMONS,"And, like a wine, poured itself out for me"
185,SUMMONS,"To drink of, to be warmed with, and to go"
186,SUMMONS,Refreshed and strengthened to the ceaseless fight;
187,SUMMONS,To meet with confidence the cynic years;
188,SUMMONS,"Battling in wars that never can be won,"
189,SUMMONS,Seeking the lost cause and the brave defeat!

196,PRAYER,"God, though this life is but a wraith,"
197,PRAYER,"Although we know not what we use,"
198,PRAYER,"Although we grope with little faith,"
199,PRAYER,Give me the heart to fight--and lose.
200,PRAYER,
201,PRAYER,"Ever insurgent let me be,"
202,PRAYER,Make me more daring than devout;
203,PRAYER,From sleek contentment keep me free.
204,PRAYER,And fill me with a buoyant doubt.
205,PRAYER,
206,PRAYER,Open my eyes to visions girt
207,PRAYER,"With beauty, and with wonder lit--"
208,PRAYER,"But let me always see the dirt,"
209,PRAYER,And all that spawn and die in it.
210,PRAYER,
211,PRAYER,Open my ears to music; let
212,PRAYER,Me thrill with Spring's first flutes and drums--
213,PRAYER,But never let me dare forget
214,PRAYER,The bitter ballads of the slums.
215,PRAYER,
216,PRAYER,"From compromise and things half-done,"
217,PRAYER,"Keep me, with stern and stubborn pride;"
218,PRAYER,"And when, at last, the fight is won"
219,PRAYER,"God, keep me still unsatisfied."

224,TO ARMS!,TO ARMS!
225,TO ARMS!,
226,TO ARMS!,Who can be dull or wrapped in unconcern
227,TO ARMS!,Knowing a world so clamorous and keen;
228,TO ARMS!,"A world of ardent conflict, honest spleen,"
229,TO ARMS!,"And healthy, hot desires too swift to turn;"
230,TO ARMS!,Vivid and vulgar--with no heart to learn...
231,TO ARMS!,"See how that drudge, a thing unkempt, unclean,"
232,TO ARMS!,Laughs with the royal laughter of a queen.
233,TO ARMS!,Even in her the eager fires burn.
234,TO ARMS!,
235,TO ARMS!,Who can be listless in these stirring hours
236,TO ARMS!,"When, with athletic courage, we engage"
237,TO ARMS!,"To storm, with fierce abandon, sterner powers"
238,TO ARMS!,And meet indifference with a joyful rage;
239,TO ARMS!,Thrilled with a purpose and the dream that towers
240,TO ARMS!,Out of this arrogant and blundering age.
241,TO ARMS!,
242,TO ARMS!,
243,TO ARMS!,
244,TO ARMS!,

246,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,
247,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"(Jerome Epstein--August 8, 1912)"
248,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,
249,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"Lo--to the battle-ground of Life,"
250,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"Child, you have come, like a conquering shout,"
251,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Out of a struggle--into strife;
252,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Out of a darkness--into doubt.
253,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,
254,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"Girt with the fragile armor of Youth,"
255,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"Child, you must ride into endless wars,"
256,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"With the sword of protest, the buckler of truth,"
257,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,And a banner of love to sweep the stars.
258,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,
259,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,About you the world's despair will surge;
260,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Into defeat you must plunge and grope--
261,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Be to the faltering an urge;
262,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Be to the hopeless years a hope!
263,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,
264,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Be to the darkened world a flame;
265,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,Be to its unconcern a blow--
266,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,"For out of its pain and tumult you came,"
267,ON THE BIRTH OF A CHILD,And into its tumult and pain you go.

272,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD
273,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,
274,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,How much of Godhood did it take--
275,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"What purging epochs had to pass,"
276,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,Ere I was fit for leaf and lake
277,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,And worthy of the patient grass?
278,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,
279,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"What mighty travails must have been,"
280,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"What ages must have moulded me,"
281,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,Ere I was raised and made akin
282,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"To dawn, the daisy and the sea."
283,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,
284,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"In what great struggles was I felled,"
285,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"In what old lives I labored long,"
286,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,Ere I was given a world that held
287,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"A meadow, butterflies and Song?"
288,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,
289,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"But oh, what cleansings and what fears,"
290,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"What countless raisings from the dead,"
291,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,"Ere I could see Her, touched with tears,"
292,HOW MUCH OF GODHOOD,Pillow the little weary head.

297,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,THE GREAT CAROUSAL
298,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,
299,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Oh, do not think me dead when I"
300,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Beneath a bit of earth shall lie;
301,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Think not that aught can ever kill
302,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,My arrogant and stubborn will.
303,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"My buoyant strength, my eager soul,"
304,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,My stern desire shall keep me whole
305,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And lift me from the drowsy deep...
306,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"I shall not even yield to Sleep,"
307,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,For Death can never take from me
308,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"My warm, insatiate energy;"
309,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,He shall not dare to touch one part
310,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Of the gay challenge of my heart.
311,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"And I shall laugh at him, and lie"
312,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Happy beneath a laughing sky;
313,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,For I have fought too joyously
314,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,To let the conqueror conquer me--
315,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"I know that, after strengthening strife,"
316,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Death cannot quench my love of life;
317,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Rob me of my dear self, my ears"
318,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Of music or my eyes of tears ...
319,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"No, Death shall come in friendlier guise;"
320,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,The cloths of darkness from my eyes
321,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"He shall roll back, and lo, the sea"
322,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Of Silence shall not cover me.
323,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"He shall make soft my final bed,"
324,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Stand, like a servant, at my head;"
325,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"And, thrilled with all that Death may give,"
326,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,I shall lie down to rest--and live...
327,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,
328,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And I shall know within the earth
329,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,A softer but a deeper mirth.
330,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,The wind shall never troll a song
331,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"But I shall hear it borne along,"
332,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And echoed long before he passes
333,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,By all the little unborn grasses.
334,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"I shall be clasped by roots and rains,"
335,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Feeding and fed by living grains;
336,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,There shall not be a single flower
337,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Above my head but bears my power,"
338,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And every butterfly or bee
339,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,That tastes the flower shall drink of me.
340,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Ah, we shall share a lip to lip"
341,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Carousal and companionship!
342,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,
343,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"The storm, like some great blustering lout,"
344,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Shall play his games with me and shout
345,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,His joy to all the country-side.
346,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Autumn, sun-tanned and April-eyed,"
347,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Shall scamper by and send his hosts
348,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Of leaves, like brown and merry ghosts,"
349,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,To frolic over me; and stones
350,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Shall feel the dancing in their bones.
351,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And red-cheeked Winter too shall be
352,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"A jovial bed-fellow for me,"
353,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Setting the startled hours ringing
354,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,With boisterous tales and lusty singing.
355,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"And, like a mother that has smiled"
356,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"For years on every tired child,"
357,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Summer shall hold me in her lap...
358,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And when the root stirs and the sap
359,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Climbs anxiously beyond the boughs,"
360,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"And all the friendly worms carouse,"
361,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Then, oh, how proudly, we shall sing"
362,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Bravuras for the feet of Spring!
363,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,
364,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And I shall lie forever there
365,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Like some great king, and watch the fair"
366,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Young Spring dance on for me, and know"
367,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,That love and rosy valleys glow
368,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Where'er her blithe feet touch the earth.
369,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,And headlong joy and reckless mirth
370,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Seeing her footsteps shall pursue.
371,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Oh, I shall watch her smile and strew"
372,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Laughter and life with either hand;
373,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"And every quiver of the land,"
374,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Shall pierce me, while a joyful wave"
375,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Beats in upon my radiant grave.
376,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Aye, like a king in deathless state"
377,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"I shall be throned, and contemplate"
378,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"The dying of the years, the vast"
379,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Vague panorama of the past,"
380,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"The march of centuries, the surge"
381,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Of ages .... but the deathless urge
382,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Shall stir me always, and my will"
383,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Shall laugh to keep me living still;
384,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Thrilling with every call and cry--
385,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,Too much in love with life to die.
386,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Content to touch the earth, to hear"
387,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"The whisper of each waiting year,"
388,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"To help the stars go proudly by,"
389,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"To speed the timid grass; and lie,"
390,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,"Sharing, with every movement's breath,"
391,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,The rich eternity of Death.
392,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,
393,THE GREAT CAROUSAL,

404,THANKS,That life is such a proud and crashing wave;
405,THANKS,"That none, but lifeless things, shall be Time's slave,"
406,THANKS,Like the long-dead but never tiring moon;
407,THANKS,
408,THANKS,That godlike passion strangely leaps and runs;

416,GOD'S YOUTH,GOD'S YOUTH
417,GOD'S YOUTH,
418,GOD'S YOUTH,I often wish that I had been alive
419,GOD'S YOUTH,"Ere God grew old, before His eyes were tired"
420,GOD'S YOUTH,Of the eternal circlings of the sun;
421,GOD'S YOUTH,Of the perpetual Springs; the weary years
422,GOD'S YOUTH,Forever marching on an unknown quest;
423,GOD'S YOUTH,"The yawning seasons pacing to and fro,"
424,GOD'S YOUTH,Like stolid sentinels to guard the earth.
425,GOD'S YOUTH,I wish that I had been alive when He
426,GOD'S YOUTH,Was still delighted with each casual thing
427,GOD'S YOUTH,"His mind could fashion, when His soul first thrilled"
428,GOD'S YOUTH,With childlike pleasure at the blooming sun;
429,GOD'S YOUTH,"When the first dawn met His enraptured eyes,"
430,GOD'S YOUTH,And the first prayers of men stirred in His heart.
431,GOD'S YOUTH,With what a glow of pride He heard the stars
432,GOD'S YOUTH,Rush by Him singing as they bravely leaped
433,GOD'S YOUTH,"Into the unexplored and endless skies,"
434,GOD'S YOUTH,"Bearing His beauty, like a battle-cry."
435,GOD'S YOUTH,"Or watched the light, obedient to His will,"
436,GOD'S YOUTH,"Spring out of nothingness to answer Him,"
437,GOD'S YOUTH,Hurling strange suns and planets in its joy
438,GOD'S YOUTH,Of fiery freedom from the lifeless dark.
439,GOD'S YOUTH,"But more than all the splendid heavens He made,"
440,GOD'S YOUTH,"The elements new-tamed, the harnessed worlds;"
441,GOD'S YOUTH,"In spite of these, it must have pleased Him most"
442,GOD'S YOUTH,"To feel Himself branch out, let go, dare all,"
443,GOD'S YOUTH,"Give utterance to His vaguely-formed desires,"
444,GOD'S YOUTH,"And loose a flood of fancies, wild and frank."
445,GOD'S YOUTH,
446,GOD'S YOUTH,"Oh those were noble times; those gay attempts,"
447,GOD'S YOUTH,Those vast and droll experiments that were made
448,GOD'S YOUTH,When God was young and blithe and whimsical.
449,GOD'S YOUTH,"When, from the infinite humor of His heart,"
450,GOD'S YOUTH,"He made the elk with such extravagant horns,"
451,GOD'S YOUTH,"The grotesque monkey-folk, the angel-fish,"
452,GOD'S YOUTH,That make the ocean's depths a visual heaven;
453,GOD'S YOUTH,"The animals like plants, the plants like beasts;"
454,GOD'S YOUTH,"The loud, inane hyena, and the great"
455,GOD'S YOUTH,"Impossible giraffe, whose silly head"
456,GOD'S YOUTH,"Threatens the stars, his feet embracing earth."
457,GOD'S YOUTH,"The paradox of the peacock, whose bright form"
458,GOD'S YOUTH,"Is like a brilliant trumpet, and his voice"
459,GOD'S YOUTH,"A strident squawk, a cackle and a joke."
460,GOD'S YOUTH,"The ostrich, like a snake tied to a bird,"
461,GOD'S YOUTH,"All out of sense and drawing, wilder far"
462,GOD'S YOUTH,"Than all the mad, fantastic thoughts of men."
463,GOD'S YOUTH,"The hump-backed camel, like a lump of clay,"
464,GOD'S YOUTH,"Thumbed at for hours, and then thrown aside."
465,GOD'S YOUTH,"The elephant, with splendid, useless tooth,"
466,GOD'S YOUTH,And nose and arm and fingers all in one.
467,GOD'S YOUTH,"The hippopotamus, absurd and bland--"
468,GOD'S YOUTH,"Oh, how God must have laughed when first He saw"
469,GOD'S YOUTH,These great jests breathe and love and walk about;
470,GOD'S YOUTH,And how the heavens must have echoed him...
471,GOD'S YOUTH,For greater than His beauty or His wrath
472,GOD'S YOUTH,Was God's vast mirth before His back was bent
473,GOD'S YOUTH,"With Time and all the troubling universe,"
474,GOD'S YOUTH,Ere He grew dull and weary with creating...
475,GOD'S YOUTH,"Oh, to have been alive and heard that laugh"
476,GOD'S YOUTH,"Thrilling the stars, convulsing all the earth,"
477,GOD'S YOUTH,"While meteors flashed from out His sparkling eyes,"
478,GOD'S YOUTH,"And even the eternal, placid Night"
479,GOD'S YOUTH,"Forgot to lift reproving fingers, smiled"
480,GOD'S YOUTH,"And joined, indulgent, in the merriment..."

492,IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS,And all the world becomes a flaming hill.
493,IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS,Surely the driest dust must turn and thrill
494,IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS,When these wild breezes sweep out all despair--
495,IN THE BERKSHIRE HILLS,"And lakes are bluest, pools are starriest where"

532,REVELATION,Heavy with languid thoughts and long;
533,REVELATION,"The air breathes faintly, half in swoon,"
534,REVELATION,Like silence trembling after Song.
535,REVELATION,The mighty calmness seems to draw
536,REVELATION,My spirit through a painless birth--
537,REVELATION,"And now, with eyes that never saw,"
538,REVELATION,I see the poetry of earth.
539,REVELATION,
540,REVELATION,"That group of old maple-trees brooding in peace by the river,"
541,REVELATION,"Happy with sunlight, and an oriole singing among them--"
542,REVELATION,"Lo, what a marvel (what rapture for Him who first sung them)"
543,REVELATION,"That here, in less space than a carpenter's workshop, the Giver"
544,REVELATION,Has fashioned a casual wonder
545,REVELATION,Greater than dawn or the thunder.
546,REVELATION,Here in a dozen of feet He has blended
547,REVELATION,"Music and motion and color and form,"
548,REVELATION,Each in itself a creation so splendid
549,REVELATION,"That, were it the world's one beauty, 'twould warm"
550,REVELATION,And kindle all Life till it ended.
551,REVELATION,
552,REVELATION,Birds and old maple-trees--
553,REVELATION,"Only to think of these,"
554,REVELATION,Only to dream of them here for an hour
555,REVELATION,Is to know all the secrets of earth.
556,REVELATION,For here is the world that God sang into flower
557,REVELATION,And bloom at its birth--
558,REVELATION,Here is its magical uplift and power;
559,REVELATION,Its music and mirth.
560,REVELATION,
561,REVELATION,Here the sun scarcely wakes;
562,REVELATION,Like a monarch it takes
563,REVELATION,Rest on the lordliest branches alone.
564,REVELATION,Till a glad tremor shakes
565,REVELATION,Every leaf that is blown--
566,REVELATION,"While a zephyr advancing,"
567,REVELATION,Breathes gently and breaks
568,REVELATION,The light into dancing
569,REVELATION,"Figures, with glancing"
570,REVELATION,Rhythms and rhymes of their own.
571,REVELATION,
572,REVELATION,"Yes, here in this spot, in this edge of an acre"
573,REVELATION,"All of the world is, the heart and the whole of it--"
574,REVELATION,Here is a universe; daily the Maker
575,REVELATION,Shows here the sweet and extravagant soul of it.
576,REVELATION,For the arms of the maple have held in their cover
577,REVELATION,"The earth and the sky and the stars, every one--"
578,REVELATION,"Not the tenderest twig but has known, like a lover"
579,REVELATION,"The silence, the night and the sun."
580,REVELATION,
581,REVELATION,"Not the airiest bird but has sung, all unknowing,"
582,REVELATION,The joy of each minstrel that carols unheard.
583,REVELATION,"And Summer, green fields and a world of things growing,"
584,REVELATION,Are brought to this spot by the breath of a bird.
585,REVELATION,"And there's never a wind but brings road-sides and ranches,"
586,REVELATION,Forests and tales of the far-off and free--
587,REVELATION,And the rush of the breeze as it sings in the branches
588,REVELATION,Echoes and answers the rush of the sea...
589,REVELATION,
590,REVELATION,A group of old maple-trees brooding in peace by the river--
591,REVELATION,"That--and a bird, nothing else...  But above and around it,"
592,REVELATION,"The spell of the infinite beauty, half-hidden forever,"
593,REVELATION,"Lies, like a secret of God's--and here I have found it."
594,REVELATION,The hymn of the cosmic--the anthem that has for its choir
595,REVELATION,"Stars, rivers and flowers--still rises and sweeps me along;"
596,REVELATION,While the cry of the oriole melts in a sunset of fire
597,REVELATION,"And the heavens, a jubilant chorus, are flushed with the"
598,REVELATION,fires of Song!

970,A BIRTHDAY,Again I come
971,A BIRTHDAY,With my handful of Song--
972,A BIRTHDAY,With my trumpery gift tricked out and made showy with rhyme.
973,A BIRTHDAY,"It is Spring, and the time"
974,A BIRTHDAY,When your thoughts are long;
975,A BIRTHDAY,When the blossoming world in its confident prime
976,A BIRTHDAY,Whispers and wakens imperative dreams;
977,A BIRTHDAY,When you color and start
978,A BIRTHDAY,With the airiest schemes
979,A BIRTHDAY,And the laughter of children is stirring your heart...
980,A BIRTHDAY,
981,A BIRTHDAY,With all of these voices that rise to restore you
982,A BIRTHDAY,"To gladness again,"
983,A BIRTHDAY,"With your heart full of things that sing and adore you,"
984,A BIRTHDAY,I come with my strain--
985,A BIRTHDAY,I come with my tinkling that patters like rain
986,A BIRTHDAY,On a rickety pane;
987,A BIRTHDAY,With a jingle of words and old tunes which have long
988,A BIRTHDAY,Done duty in song;
989,A BIRTHDAY,"Spreading my verse, like a showman, before you..."
990,A BIRTHDAY,"And you turn to the world, as you turn to the bosom that bore you."
991,A BIRTHDAY,
992,A BIRTHDAY,"In all this singing at your heart,"
993,A BIRTHDAY,"In all this ringing through the day,"
994,A BIRTHDAY,In the bravado of the May
995,A BIRTHDAY,I have no part....
996,A BIRTHDAY,For I am not one with the conquering year
997,A BIRTHDAY,That wakes without fear
998,A BIRTHDAY,"The lyrical souls of the feathery throng,"
999,A BIRTHDAY,That flames in the heavens when evenings are long;
1000,A BIRTHDAY,That surges with power and urges with cheer
1001,A BIRTHDAY,"The boldness of love, the laugh of the strong,"
1002,A BIRTHDAY,And the confident song...
1003,A BIRTHDAY,
1004,A BIRTHDAY,I am no longer the masterful lover
1005,A BIRTHDAY,Storming my way to the shrine of your heart;
1006,A BIRTHDAY,Reckless with youth and the zest to discover
1007,A BIRTHDAY,All that the world sets apart.
1008,A BIRTHDAY,I am no longer
1009,A BIRTHDAY,Wiser and stronger;
1010,A BIRTHDAY,No longer I shout in the face of the world;
1011,A BIRTHDAY,No longer my challenge is sounded and hurled
1012,A BIRTHDAY,With such fury that even the heavens must hear it.
1013,A BIRTHDAY,No longer I mount on a passionate flood--
1014,A BIRTHDAY,"Something has changed my arrogant spirit,"
1015,A BIRTHDAY,Something has left my braggart blood.
1016,A BIRTHDAY,Something has left me--something has entered in--
1017,A BIRTHDAY,"Something I knew not, something beyond my desire."
1018,A BIRTHDAY,Deeper and gentler I hold you; all that has been
1019,A BIRTHDAY,Seems like a spark that is lost in a forest of fire.
1020,A BIRTHDAY,"Minor my song is, for still the old memories burn--"
1021,A BIRTHDAY,Only in you and your thought do I find my release...
1022,A BIRTHDAY,"I have done with the blustering airs, and I turn"

1026,A BIRTHDAY,Out of the cries and alarms
1027,A BIRTHDAY,All of the tumult is vain...
1028,A BIRTHDAY,Here in your arms._
1029,A BIRTHDAY,
1030,A BIRTHDAY,Hold me again--
1031,A BIRTHDAY,Oft have we wandered apart;
1032,A BIRTHDAY,Now it is all made plain...
1033,A BIRTHDAY,Here in your heart.
1034,A BIRTHDAY,
1035,A BIRTHDAY,Heal me again--
1036,A BIRTHDAY,Cleanse me with tears that remove
1037,A BIRTHDAY,Pain and the ruins of pain...
1038,A BIRTHDAY,Here in your love.
1039,A BIRTHDAY,
1040,A BIRTHDAY,Minor my song was--abashed I must lower my voice;
1041,A BIRTHDAY,Something has touched me with nobler and holier fire;
1042,A BIRTHDAY,"Something that thrills, as when trumpets and children rejoice;"
1043,A BIRTHDAY,"Something I knew not, something beyond my desire..."
1044,A BIRTHDAY,Minor no longer--the sighing and droning depart;
1045,A BIRTHDAY,In a chorus of triumph the jubilant spirits increase--
1046,A BIRTHDAY,"Shelter and spur me forever in the merciful strength of your heart,"
1047,A BIRTHDAY,You who have soothed me with passion and roused me with
1048,A BIRTHDAY,passionate peace.

1147,HEALED,Where the butterfly sinks and the swallow reels
1148,HEALED,"Giddy with Spring, with its smells and sounds--"
1149,HEALED,And I go...
1150,HEALED,
1151,HEALED,"For of late I have fretted and sulked, and clung to my books"
1152,HEALED,and the house;
1153,HEALED,Lethargic with winter fancies and dulled with a torpid mood--
1154,HEALED,But now I am called by the grasses; the rumor of blossoming boughs;
1155,HEALED,The hints of a thousand singers and the ancient thrill of the wood.
1156,HEALED,
1157,HEALED,For the streets run over with sunlight and spill
1158,HEALED,A glory on bricks and the dustiest sill;
1159,HEALED,"And Life, like a great drum, pulses and pounds--"
1160,HEALED,"I follow the world and I follow my will,"
1161,HEALED,And I go to see what the park reveals
1162,HEALED,"When the winds, like a pack of buoyant hounds,"
1163,HEALED,Snap at my dragging heels...
1164,HEALED,
1165,HEALED,Once with the green again
1166,HEALED,How I am changed--
1167,HEALED,"Lo, I have seen again"
1168,HEALED,Friends long estranged.

1172,HEALED,Greater than ever!

1175,HEALED,Rich with new urges
1176,HEALED,Life in its fullness now
1177,HEALED,Surges and purges
1178,HEALED,All that is brash in me--
1179,HEALED,Sunlight and Song
1180,HEALED,These things will fashion me
1181,HEALED,Splendid and strong.
1182,HEALED,
1183,HEALED,Splendid and strong I shall grow once again;
1184,HEALED,"Joyful and clean as the mind of a child,"
1185,HEALED,"As tears after pain,"
1186,HEALED,"Or hearts reconciled,"
1187,HEALED,"As woods washed with rain,"
1188,HEALED,"As love in the wild,"
1189,HEALED,Or that bird to whom all things but singing is vain.
1190,HEALED,
1191,HEALED,"""Bird, there were songs in your heart just as rapturous"
1192,HEALED,As these that you bring--
1193,HEALED,Why when we longed for your magic to capture us
1194,HEALED,Did you not sing?
1195,HEALED,Now with the world making music we heed you not.
1196,HEALED,"Coward, for all your fine challenge, we need you not--"
1197,HEALED,"We too are brave with the Spring!"""
1198,HEALED,
1199,HEALED,So I sang--but a something was missing; the song
1200,HEALED,"and the sunlight were stale,"
1201,HEALED,Though a squirrel had sat on my shoulder and sparrows
1202,HEALED,had fed from my hand;
1203,HEALED,Though I heard the white laughter of ripples and the breezes'
1204,HEALED,"faint answering hail,"
1205,HEALED,And somewhere a bird's voice I knew not--yet hearing could
1206,HEALED,half understand...
1207,HEALED,
1208,HEALED,"And lo, at my doorstep I saw it; it shouted to me as I came--"
1209,HEALED,"It laughed in its simple revealment, a miracle common and wild;"
1210,HEALED,"Plainly I heard and beheld it, bright as a forest of flame--"
1211,HEALED,"And its face was the face of a mother, and its voice was the"
1212,HEALED,voice of a child.

1901,LANDSCAPES,"With sharpened outlines, eloquently clear,"
1902,LANDSCAPES,As though one saw it in a crystal sphere.
1903,LANDSCAPES,The rusty sumac with its struggling spires;
1904,LANDSCAPES,The golden-rod with all its million fires;

1919,LANDSCAPES,"There seemed to spread a sharp and kindling mirth,"

1930,LANDSCAPES,"No longer calm or drooping listlessly,"
1931,LANDSCAPES,Letting its languid branches sway and fall
1932,LANDSCAPES,As though it danced in some sad ritual;
1933,LANDSCAPES,"But rather like a young, athletic girl,"
1934,LANDSCAPES,"Fearless and gay, her hair all out of curl,"

1941,LANDSCAPES,"Turn all their fruit to little worlds of flame,"
1942,LANDSCAPES,And burn the trembling orchard there below.

1953,LANDSCAPES,Cheap music blared and evil alleys sprawled.
1954,LANDSCAPES,"The roaring avenues, the shrieking mills;"

2063,SUNDAY,"Raged the heedless panic, hour-long and bitter."
2064,SUNDAY,"Passion tore and trampled; men once mild and peaceful,"
2065,SUNDAY,Fought with savage hatred in the name of Law and Order.

2331,THE DYING DECADENT,
2332,THE DYING DECADENT,
2333,THE DYING DECADENT,"He wandered in a forest dark and deep,"
2334,THE DYING DECADENT,Where phantoms passed him with a soft caress;
2335,THE DYING DECADENT,Where shadows moved and ghostly spirits stood
2336,THE DYING DECADENT,"Sphinxes of silence, wraiths of mystery;"
2337,THE DYING DECADENT,"A magic wood, a strange and scented wood"
2338,THE DYING DECADENT,Where roses sprang from every withered tree.
2339,THE DYING DECADENT,"A wood that woke his wonder and his fear,"
2340,THE DYING DECADENT,"A wood of whispered spells and shameful lore,"
2341,THE DYING DECADENT,Beyond whose furthest rim he seemed to hear
2342,THE DYING DECADENT,A lonely sea upon a lonelier shore.
2343,THE DYING DECADENT,"Visions swept by him with a chanted spell,"
2344,THE DYING DECADENT,Crouched at his feet and murmured at his side--
2345,THE DYING DECADENT,And like a dim refrain there rose and fell
2346,THE DYING DECADENT,The restless minor of an ebbing tide...
2347,THE DYING DECADENT,"Then, amidst broken sighs and wafts of song,"
2348,THE DYING DECADENT,"Borne on the breezes blowing from the west,"
2349,THE DYING DECADENT,He saw one figure dancing in the throng
2350,THE DYING DECADENT,More wan and wonderful than all the rest.
2351,THE DYING DECADENT,
2352,THE DYING DECADENT,"The singing grew and nearer still she came,"
2353,THE DYING DECADENT,A being made of rose and fire and mist;
2354,THE DYING DECADENT,Her deep eyes burning like the purple flame
2355,THE DYING DECADENT,Hid in the heart of every amethyst.
2356,THE DYING DECADENT,"And, with the crooning of the distant sea,"
2357,THE DYING DECADENT,She sang to charm his soul and still his fear:

2359,THE DYING DECADENT,"Oh, come, for you have called, and I am here..."
2360,THE DYING DECADENT,"Oh, I have waited long to bring you there,"
2361,THE DYING DECADENT,"Beyond the border of the things that are,"
2362,THE DYING DECADENT,"Where all is terrible and strange and fair,"
2363,THE DYING DECADENT,As were your dreams that reached my favorite star...
2364,THE DYING DECADENT,For you shall live and set the suns to rhyme;

2373,THE DYING DECADENT,"And you shall know the maidens of the moon,"
2374,THE DYING DECADENT,Lying on lilies shall you see them dance;
2375,THE DYING DECADENT,"And you shall fling red roses to the tune,"
2376,THE DYING DECADENT,Great roses while the magic scene enchants.
2377,THE DYING DECADENT,Wantons and queens shall take your heart to play
2378,THE DYING DECADENT,And lose it in a mesh of tangled hair;
2379,THE DYING DECADENT,"And you shall always give your heart away,"
2380,THE DYING DECADENT,And find a new one every hour there.
2381,THE DYING DECADENT,Here are the notes of every nightingale
2382,THE DYING DECADENT,Like rare pearls dropping in a golden pan;
2383,THE DYING DECADENT,"And you shall hear white music in each dale,"
2384,THE DYING DECADENT,Sweet silver sounds that are not heard by man.
2385,THE DYING DECADENT,"And I shall show you all the world's delight,"
2386,THE DYING DECADENT,The unknown passion of each flaming star;

2389,THE DYING DECADENT,"Oh come, they wait you on the further strand--"
2390,THE DYING DECADENT,Your drab and mournful mood they will exchange
2391,THE DYING DECADENT,For joy's resplendent purple in the land
2392,THE DYING DECADENT,Where all is rhythmical and fair and strange...
2393,THE DYING DECADENT,"Oh come and learn the songs unborn, unsung,"
2394,THE DYING DECADENT,"And I shall give you all your longing craves,"

2396,THE DYING DECADENT,"Moonlight and music and the sound of waves."""
2397,THE DYING DECADENT,
2398,THE DYING DECADENT,Entranced he stood--so exquisite the art
2399,THE DYING DECADENT,That charmed him he could scarcely whisper low:
2400,THE DYING DECADENT,"""And who are you that comes to stir my heart"
2401,THE DYING DECADENT,With fragments of the songs I used to know----
2402,THE DYING DECADENT,"You speak of wild and yet familiar things,"
2403,THE DYING DECADENT,Exotic passions and uncanny bliss;
2404,THE DYING DECADENT,A thousand dreams your voice recalls and brings;
2405,THE DYING DECADENT,"And who are you that shows me all of this?"""
2406,THE DYING DECADENT,"""I am the soul and spirit of your songs;"
2407,THE DYING DECADENT,"I am your ballad's grief, your lyric's fire."
2408,THE DYING DECADENT,I am the light for which your yearning longs;
2409,THE DYING DECADENT,Your curious rapture and your sick desire.
2410,THE DYING DECADENT,I am the burden that your lays beseech;
2411,THE DYING DECADENT,The one refrain that flows through all your themes.
2412,THE DYING DECADENT,"I am the eerie glamor of your speech,"
2413,THE DYING DECADENT,I am the mystic radiance of your dreams.
2414,THE DYING DECADENT,"Come then with me, where all men's dreams are born,"
2415,THE DYING DECADENT,Where winds shall lift your perfumed thoughts aloft;
2416,THE DYING DECADENT,"Where there is never night or noon or morn,"
2417,THE DYING DECADENT,"Only a twilight, sensuous and soft."
2418,THE DYING DECADENT,"And you shall know the wonder of each year,"
2419,THE DYING DECADENT,The fiery secrets of a myriad Springs...
2420,THE DYING DECADENT,Lying on lilies shall you see them here;
2421,THE DYING DECADENT,"And you shall live and touch immortal things."""
2422,THE DYING DECADENT,
2423,THE DYING DECADENT,She paused and sighed.  Slowly he shook his head
2424,THE DYING DECADENT,As one who sees a guarded flame go out;
2425,THE DYING DECADENT,"""Never to die?  Nay that alone,"" he said,"
2426,THE DYING DECADENT,"""Were worse than all this wandering in doubt."
2427,THE DYING DECADENT,Nor would I go if Death himself should come
2428,THE DYING DECADENT,To crown Life's blessing with a greater gift;
2429,THE DYING DECADENT,In such a perfect world I would be dumb--
2430,THE DYING DECADENT,What could I long for when my fancies drift?...
2431,THE DYING DECADENT,"And more than this, I do not choose to go;"
2432,THE DYING DECADENT,"For I am sick of strange and subtle sounds,"
2433,THE DYING DECADENT,"Of fevered phrases, tinted words that glow,"
2434,THE DYING DECADENT,And all the twisting art that but astounds.
2435,THE DYING DECADENT,I do not long for tortured harmonies;
2436,THE DYING DECADENT,No more my languid soul is racked and tossed
2437,THE DYING DECADENT,With yearning for strange shores and stranger seas--
2438,THE DYING DECADENT,I seek the visions I have long since lost.
2439,THE DYING DECADENT,"I seek the ways of simple love and hate,"
2440,THE DYING DECADENT,Once more I long to join the virile race;
2441,THE DYING DECADENT,"For I was blind till now, and now too late"
2442,THE DYING DECADENT,I see the wonder of the commonplace.
2443,THE DYING DECADENT,
2444,THE DYING DECADENT,"""I long to hear men's voices, coarse and wild,"
2445,THE DYING DECADENT,That never knew a poet's wan desire;
2446,THE DYING DECADENT,"I long to hear them, as a little child"
2447,THE DYING DECADENT,Listens to elders grouped about the fire...
2448,THE DYING DECADENT,To hear them as they mingle grave and gay--
2449,THE DYING DECADENT,"The prudent planning for the week, and then"
2450,THE DYING DECADENT,"Amid the tritest gossip of the day,"
2451,THE DYING DECADENT,"Quaint, petty talk of merchandise and men."
2452,THE DYING DECADENT,I crave the usual and homely themes;
2453,THE DYING DECADENT,The everyday of which no mermaid sings....
2454,THE DYING DECADENT,These are the fairest fragments of my dreams;
2455,THE DYING DECADENT,"These are the conquering and deathless things."""
2456,THE DYING DECADENT,
2457,THE DYING DECADENT,"He ceased; a sudden radiance round him shone,"
2458,THE DYING DECADENT,And all things melted like a phantom wrack.
2459,THE DYING DECADENT,And as he swept his hands and stood alone
2460,THE DYING DECADENT,He heard hoarse thunders and the dusk grew black.
2461,THE DYING DECADENT,Vast tremors shook the world from side to side--
2462,THE DYING DECADENT,The earth and sky became a monstrous blot...
2463,THE DYING DECADENT,
2464,THE DYING DECADENT,"_And then it seems he woke, and waking, died;"
