82,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
83,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
84,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Flammonde
85,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
86,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
87,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
88,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The man Flammonde, from God knows where,"
89,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With firm address and foreign air,"
90,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With news of nations in his talk
91,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And something royal in his walk,"
92,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With glint of iron in his eyes,"
93,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But never doubt, nor yet surprise,"
94,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Appeared, and stayed, and held his head"
95,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As one by kings accredited.
96,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
97,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Erect, with his alert repose"
98,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"About him, and about his clothes,"
99,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He pictured all tradition hears
100,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of what we owe to fifty years.
101,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,His cleansing heritage of taste
102,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Paraded neither want nor waste;
103,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And what he needed for his fee
104,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To live, he borrowed graciously."
105,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
106,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He never told us what he was,"
107,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or what mischance, or other cause,"
108,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Had banished him from better days
109,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To play the Prince of Castaways.
110,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Meanwhile he played surpassing well
111,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A part, for most, unplayable;"
112,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In fine, one pauses, half afraid"
113,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To say for certain that he played.
114,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
115,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For that, one may as well forego"
116,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Conviction as to yes or no;
117,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Nor can I say just how intense
118,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would then have been the difference
119,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To several, who, having striven"
120,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In vain to get what he was given,"
121,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would see the stranger taken on
122,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,By friends not easy to be won.
123,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
124,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Moreover, many a malcontent"
125,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He soothed and found munificent;
126,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,His courtesy beguiled and foiled
127,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Suspicion that his years were soiled;
128,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His mien distinguished any crowd,"
129,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,His credit strengthened when he bowed;
130,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And women, young and old, were fond"
131,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of looking at the man Flammonde.
132,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
133,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There was a woman in our town
134,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On whom the fashion was to frown;
135,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But while our talk renewed the tinge
136,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of a long-faded scarlet fringe,"
137,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The man Flammonde saw none of that,"
138,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And what he saw we wondered at--
139,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That none of us, in her distress,"
140,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Could hide or find our littleness.
141,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
142,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There was a boy that all agreed
143,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Had shut within him the rare seed
144,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of learning.  We could understand,"
145,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But none of us could lift a hand.
146,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The man Flammonde appraised the youth,"
147,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And told a few of us the truth;
148,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And thereby, for a little gold,"
149,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A flowered future was unrolled.
150,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
151,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There were two citizens who fought
152,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For years and years, and over nought;"
153,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"They made life awkward for their friends,"
154,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And shortened their own dividends.
155,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The man Flammonde said what was wrong
156,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Should be made right; nor was it long
157,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Before they were again in line,"
158,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And had each other in to dine.
159,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
160,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And these I mention are but four
161,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of many out of many more.
162,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So much for them.  But what of him--
163,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So firm in every look and limb?
164,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What small satanic sort of kink
165,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was in his brain?  What broken link
166,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Withheld him from the destinies
167,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That came so near to being his?
168,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
169,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What was he, when we came to sift"
170,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His meaning, and to note the drift"
171,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of incommunicable ways
172,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That make us ponder while we praise?
173,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Why was it that his charm revealed
174,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Somehow the surface of a shield?
175,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What was it that we never caught?
176,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What was he, and what was he not?"
177,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
178,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,How much it was of him we met
179,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We cannot ever know; nor yet
180,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Shall all he gave us quite atone
181,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For what was his, and his alone;"
182,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Nor need we now, since he knew best,"
183,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Nourish an ethical unrest:
184,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Rarely at once will nature give
185,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The power to be Flammonde and live.
186,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
187,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We cannot know how much we learn
188,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From those who never will return,"
189,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Until a flash of unforeseen
190,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Remembrance falls on what has been.
191,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We've each a darkening hill to climb;
192,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And this is why, from time to time"
193,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In Tilbury Town, we look beyond"
194,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Horizons for the man Flammonde.
195,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
196,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
197,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
198,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
199,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The Gift of God
200,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
201,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
202,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
203,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Blessed with a joy that only she
204,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of all alive shall ever know,"
205,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,She wears a proud humility
206,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For what it was that willed it so,--"
207,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That her degree should be so great
208,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Among the favored of the Lord
209,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That she may scarcely bear the weight
210,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of her bewildering reward.
211,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
212,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As one apart, immune, alone,"
213,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or featured for the shining ones,"
214,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And like to none that she has known
215,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of other women's other sons,--"
216,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The firm fruition of her need,"
217,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He shines anointed; and he blurs
218,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Her vision, till it seems indeed"
219,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A sacrilege to call him hers.
220,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
221,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,She fears a little for so much
222,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of what is best, and hardly dares"
223,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To think of him as one to touch
224,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With aches, indignities, and cares;"
225,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She sees him rather at the goal,"
226,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Still shining; and her dream foretells
227,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The proper shining of a soul
228,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Where nothing ordinary dwells.
229,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
230,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Perchance a canvass of the town
231,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Would find him far from flags and shouts,"
232,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And leave him only the renown
233,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of many smiles and many doubts;
234,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Perchance the crude and common tongue
235,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would havoc strangely with his worth;
236,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But she, with innocence unwrung,"
237,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would read his name around the earth.
238,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
239,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And others, knowing how this youth"
240,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Would shine, if love could make him great,"
241,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When caught and tortured for the truth
242,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would only writhe and hesitate;
243,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"While she, arranging for his days"
244,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What centuries could not fulfill,"
245,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Transmutes him with her faith and praise,"
246,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And has him shining where she will.
247,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
248,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She crowns him with her gratefulness,"
249,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And says again that life is good;
250,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And should the gift of God be less
251,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In him than in her motherhood,"
252,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His fame, though vague, will not be small,"
253,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As upward through her dream he fares,"
254,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Half clouded with a crimson fall
255,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of roses thrown on marble stairs.
256,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
257,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
258,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
259,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
260,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The Clinging Vine
261,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
262,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
263,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
264,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Be calm?  And was I frantic?"
265,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You'll have me laughing soon.
266,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'm calm as this Atlantic,"
267,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And quiet as the moon;
268,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I may have spoken faster
269,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Than once, in other days;"
270,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For I've no more a master,"
271,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And now--'Be calm,' he says."
272,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
273,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Fear not, fear no commotion,--"
274,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I'll be as rocks and sand;
275,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The moon and stars and ocean
276,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Will envy my command;
277,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No creature could be stiller
278,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In any kind of place
279,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Than I...  No, I'll not kill her;"
280,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her death is in her face.
281,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
282,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Be happy while she has it,"
283,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For she'll not have it long;
284,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A year, and then you'll pass it,"
285,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Preparing a new song.
286,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And I'm a fool for prating
287,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of what a year may bring,"
288,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When more like her are waiting
289,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For more like you to sing.
290,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
291,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You mock me with denial,"
292,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You mean to call me hard?
293,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You see no room for trial
294,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When all my doors are barred?
295,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You say, and you'd say dying,"
296,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That I dream what I know;
297,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And sighing, and denying,"
298,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You'd hold my hand and go.
299,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
300,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You scowl--and I don't wonder;"
301,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I spoke too fast again;
302,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But you'll forgive one blunder,"
303,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For you are like most men:
304,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You are,--or so you've told me,"
305,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"So many mortal times,"
306,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That heaven ought not to hold me
307,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Accountable for crimes.
308,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
309,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Be calm?  Was I unpleasant?"
310,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Then I'll be more discreet,"
311,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And grant you, for the present,"
312,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The balm of my defeat:
313,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What she, with all her striving,"
314,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Could not have brought about,"
315,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You've done.  Your own contriving
316,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Has put the last light out.
317,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
318,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""If she were the whole story,"
319,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"If worse were not behind,"
320,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'd creep with you to glory,"
321,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Believing I was blind;
322,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'd creep, and go on seeming"
323,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To be what I despise.
324,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You laugh, and say I'm dreaming,"
325,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And all your laughs are lies.
326,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
327,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Are women mad?  A few are,"
328,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And if it's true you say--
329,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If most men are as you are--
330,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We'll all be mad some day.
331,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Be calm--and let me finish;
332,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's more for you to know.
333,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'll talk while you diminish,"
334,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And listen while you grow.
335,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
336,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""There was a man who married"
337,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Because he couldn't see;
338,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And all his days he carried
339,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The mark of his degree.
340,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But you--you came clear-sighted,"
341,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And found truth in my eyes;
342,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And all my wrongs you've righted
343,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With lies, and lies, and lies."
344,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
345,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You've killed the last assurance"
346,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That once would have me strive
347,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To rouse an old endurance
348,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That is no more alive.
349,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,It makes two people chilly
350,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To say what we have said,"
351,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But you--you'll not be silly
352,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And wrangle for the dead.
353,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
354,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You don't?  You never wrangle?"
355,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Why scold then,--or complain?"
356,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,More words will only mangle
357,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What you've already slain.
358,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Your pride you can't surrender?
359,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,My name--for that you fear?
360,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Since when were men so tender,"
361,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And honor so severe?
362,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
363,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""No more--I'll never bear it."
364,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I'm going.  I'm like ice.
365,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,My burden?  You would share it?
366,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Forbid the sacrifice!
367,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Forget so quaint a notion,"
368,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And let no more be told;
369,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For moon and stars and ocean
370,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you and I are cold."""
371,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
372,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
373,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
374,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
375,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Cassandra
376,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
377,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
378,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
379,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I heard one who said:  ""Verily,"
380,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What word have I for children here?
381,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Your Dollar is your only Word,"
382,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The wrath of it your only fear.
383,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
384,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You build it altars tall enough"
385,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To make you see, but you are blind;"
386,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You cannot leave it long enough
387,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To look before you or behind.
388,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
389,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""When Reason beckons you to pause,"
390,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You laugh and say that you know best;
391,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But what it is you know, you keep"
392,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As dark as ingots in a chest.
393,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
394,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You laugh and answer, 'We are young;"
395,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"O leave us now, and let us grow.'--"
396,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not asking how much more of this
397,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Will Time endure or Fate bestow.
398,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
399,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Because a few complacent years"
400,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Have made your peril of your pride,"
401,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Think you that you are to go on
402,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Forever pampered and untried?
403,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
404,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""What lost eclipse of history,"
405,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What bivouac of the marching stars,"
406,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Has given the sign for you to see
407,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Millenniums and last great wars?
408,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
409,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""What unrecorded overthrow"
410,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of all the world has ever known,"
411,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or ever been, has made itself"
412,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"So plain to you, and you alone?"
413,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
414,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Your Dollar, Dove and Eagle make"
415,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A Trinity that even you
416,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Rate higher than you rate yourselves;
417,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"It pays, it flatters, and it's new."
418,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
419,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""And though your very flesh and blood"
420,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Be what your Eagle eats and drinks,"
421,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You'll praise him for the best of birds,"
422,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not knowing what the Eagle thinks.
423,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
424,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""The power is yours, but not the sight;"
425,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You see not upon what you tread;
426,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You have the ages for your guide,"
427,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But not the wisdom to be led.
428,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
429,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Think you to tread forever down"
430,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The merciless old verities?
431,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And are you never to have eyes
432,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To see the world for what it is?
433,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
434,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Are you to pay for what you have"
435,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With all you are?""--No other word"
436,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We caught, but with a laughing crowd"
437,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Moved on.  None heeded, and few heard."

445,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
446,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Tell me what you're doing over here, John Gorham,"
447,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Sighing hard and seeming to be sorry when you're not;

450,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
451,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I'm over here to tell you what the moon already"
452,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May have said or maybe shouted ever since a year ago;
453,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'm over here to tell you what you are, Jane Wayland,"
454,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And to make you rather sorry, I should say, for being so.""--"
455,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
456,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Tell me what you're saying to me now, John Gorham,"
457,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or you'll never see as much of me as ribbons any more;
458,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'll vanish in as many ways as I have toes and fingers,"
459,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you'll not follow far for one where flocks have been before.""--"
460,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
461,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I'm sorry now you never saw the flocks, Jane Wayland,"
462,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But you're the one to make of them as many as you need.
463,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And then about the vanishing.  It's I who mean to vanish;
464,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And when I'm here no longer you'll be done with me indeed.""--"
465,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
466,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""That's a way to tell me what I am, John Gorham!"
467,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,How am I to know myself until I make you smile?
468,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Try to look as if the moon were making faces at you,"
469,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And a little more as if you meant to stay a little while.""--"
470,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
471,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You are what it is that over rose-blown gardens"
472,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Makes a pretty flutter for a season in the sun;
473,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You are what it is that with a mouse, Jane Wayland,"
474,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Catches him and lets him go and eats him up for fun.""--"
475,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
476,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Sure I never took you for a mouse, John Gorham;"
477,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"All you say is easy, but so far from being true"
478,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That I wish you wouldn't ever be again the one to think so;
479,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For it isn't cats and butterflies that I would be to you.""--"
480,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
481,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""All your little animals are in one picture--"
482,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,One I've had before me since a year ago to-night;
483,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And the picture where they live will be of you, Jane Wayland,"
484,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Till you find a way to kill them or to keep them out of sight.""--"
485,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
486,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Won't you ever see me as I am, John Gorham,"
487,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Leaving out the foolishness and all I never meant?
488,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Somewhere in me there's a woman, if you know the way to find her."
489,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Will you like me any better if I prove it and repent?"""
490,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
491,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I doubt if I shall ever have the time, Jane Wayland;"
492,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And I dare say all this moonlight lying round us might as well
493,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Fall for nothing on the shards of broken urns that are forgotten,"
494,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As on two that have no longer much of anything to tell."""

502,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
503,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Once there was a cabin here, and once there was a man;"
504,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And something happened here before my memory began.
505,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Time has made the two of them the fuel of one flame
506,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And all we have of them is now a legend and a name.
507,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
508,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"All I have to say is what an old man said to me,"
509,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And that would seem to be as much as there will ever be.
510,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Fifty years ago it was we found it where it sat.""--"
511,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And forty years ago it was old Archibald said that.
512,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
513,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""An apple tree that's yet alive saw something, I suppose,"
514,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of what it was that happened there, and what no mortal knows."
515,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Some one on the mountain heard far off a master shriek,"
516,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And then there was a light that showed the way for men to seek.
517,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
518,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""We found it in the morning with an iron bar behind,"
519,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And there were chains around it; but no search could ever find,"
520,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Either in the ashes that were left, or anywhere,"
521,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A sign to tell of who or what had been with Stafford there.
522,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
523,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Stafford was a likely man with ideas of his own--"
524,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though I could never like the kind that likes to live alone;
525,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And when you met, you found his eyes were always on your shoes,"
526,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As if they did the talking when he asked you for the news.
527,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
528,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""That's all, my son.  Were I to talk for half a hundred years"
529,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I'd never clear away from there the cloud that never clears.
530,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We buried what was left of it,--the bar, too, and the chains;"
531,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And only for the apple tree there's nothing that remains."""
532,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
533,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Forty years ago it was I heard the old man say,"
534,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""That's all, my son.""--And here again I find the place to-day,"
535,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Deserted and told only by the tree that knows the most,"
536,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And overgrown with golden-rod as if there were no ghost.

548,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Old island walls with older seas
549,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Comes here where now September makes
550,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,An island in a sea of trees.
551,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
552,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Between the sunlight and the shade
553,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A man may learn till he forgets
554,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The roaring of a world remade,"
555,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And all his ruins and regrets;
556,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
557,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And if he still remembers here
558,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Poor fights he may have won or lost,--"

570,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Humanity with what he knows,--"
571,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
572,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may by contemplation learn
573,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A little more than what he knew,"
574,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And even see great oaks return
575,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To acorns out of which they grew.
576,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
577,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may, if he but listen well,"
578,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Through twilight and the silence here,"

580,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To vanity's impatient ear;
581,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
582,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he may never dare again
583,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Say what awaits him, or be sure"
584,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What sunlit labyrinth of pain
585,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may not enter and endure.
586,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
587,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who knows to-day from yesterday
588,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May learn to count no thing too strange:

591,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
592,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who sees enough in his duress
593,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May go as far as dreams have gone;
594,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who sees a little may do less
595,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than many who are blind have done;
596,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
597,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who sees unchastened here the soul
598,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Triumphant has no other sight
599,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than has a child who sees the whole
600,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,World radiant with his own delight.
601,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
602,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Far journeys and hard wandering
603,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Await him in whose crude surmise
604,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Peace, like a mask, hides everything"

606,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
607,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And all his wisdom is unfound,"
608,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or like a web that error weaves

620,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A wise old age anticipate,"
621,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Desiring, with his pipe and bowl,"
622,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No Khan's extravagant estate.
623,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"No crown annoyed his honest head,"
624,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No fiddlers three were called or needed;
625,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For two disastrous heirs instead
626,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Made music more than ever three did.
627,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
628,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bereft of her with whom his life
629,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Was harmony without a flaw,"
630,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He took no other for a wife,"
631,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Nor sighed for any that he saw;
632,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And if he doubted his two sons,"
633,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And heirs, Alexis and Evander,"
634,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He might have been as doubtful once
635,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of Robert Burns and Alexander.
636,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
637,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Alexis, in his early youth,"
638,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Began to steal--from old and young.
639,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Likewise Evander, and the truth"
640,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was like a bad taste on his tongue.
641,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Born thieves and liars, their affair"
642,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Seemed only to be tarred with evil--
643,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The most insufferable pair
644,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of scamps that ever cheered the devil.
645,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
646,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The world went on, their fame went on,"
647,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And they went on--from bad to worse;
648,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Till, goaded hot with nothing done,"
649,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And each accoutred with a curse,"
650,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The friends of Old King Cole, by twos,"
651,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And fours, and sevens, and elevens,"
652,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Pronounced unalterable views
653,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of doings that were not of heaven's.
654,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
655,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And having learned again whereby
656,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Their baleful zeal had come about,"
657,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,King Cole met many a wrathful eye
658,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So kindly that its wrath went out--
659,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or partly out.  Say what they would,"
660,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He seemed the more to court their candor;
661,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But never told what kind of good
662,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was in Alexis and Evander.
663,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
664,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And Old King Cole, with many a puff"
665,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That haloed his urbanity,"
666,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Would smoke till he had smoked enough,"
667,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And listen most attentively.
668,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He beamed as with an inward light
669,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That had the Lord's assurance in it;
670,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And once a man was there all night,"
671,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Expecting something every minute.
672,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
673,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But whether from too little thought,"
674,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or too much fealty to the bowl,"
675,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A dim reward was all he got
676,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For sitting up with Old King Cole.
677,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Though mine,"" the father mused aloud,"

682,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""They'll have a bad end, I'll agree,"

720,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"All most harmonious,--and out of his"
721,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Miraculous inviolable increase
722,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Fills Ilion, Rome, or any town you like"
723,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of olden time with timeless Englishmen;
724,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And I must wonder what you think of him--
725,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,All you down there where your small Avon flows
726,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"By Stratford, and where you're an Alderman."
727,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Some, for a guess, would have him riding back"
728,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To be a farrier there, or say a dyer;"
729,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or maybe one of your adept surveyors;
730,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or like enough the wizard of all tanners.
731,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not you--no fear of that; for I discern
732,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In you a kindling of the flame that saves--
733,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The nimble element, the true phlogiston;"
734,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I see it, and was told of it, moreover,"
735,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"By our discriminate friend himself, no other."
736,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Had you been one of the sad average,"
737,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As he would have it,--meaning, as I take it,"
738,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The sinew and the solvent of our Island,"
739,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You'd not be buying beer for this Terpander's
740,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Approved and estimated friend Ben Jonson;

743,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"While he goes off rehearsing, as he must,"
744,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If he shall ever be the Duke of Stratford.
745,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And my words are no shadow on your town--
746,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Far from it; for one town's as like another
747,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As all are unlike London.  Oh, he knows it,--"
748,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And there's the Stratford in him; he denies it,"
749,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And there's the Shakespeare in him.  So, God help him!"
750,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I tell him he needs Greek; but neither God
751,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Nor Greek will help him.  Nothing will help that man.
752,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You see the fates have given him so much,"
753,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He must have all or perish,--or look out"
754,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of London, where he sees too many lords;"
755,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They're part of half what ails him:  I suppose
756,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's nothing fouler down among the demons
757,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than what it is he feels when he remembers
758,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The dust and sweat and ointment of his calling
759,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With his lords looking on and laughing at him.
760,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"King as he is, he can't be king de facto,"
761,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And that's as well, because he wouldn't like it;"
762,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He'd frame a lower rating of men then
763,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than he has now; and after that would come
764,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,An abdication or an apoplexy.
765,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He can't be king, not even king of Stratford,--"
766,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Though half the world, if not the whole of it,"
767,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May crown him with a crown that fits no king
768,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Save Lord Apollo's homesick emissary:
769,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Not there on Avon, or on any stream"
770,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Where Naiads and their white arms are no more,"
771,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Shall he find home again.  It's all too bad.
772,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But there's a comfort, for he'll have that House--"
773,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The best you ever saw; and he'll be there
774,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Anon, as you're an Alderman.  Good God!"
775,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He makes me lie awake o' nights and laugh.
776,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you have known him from his origin,"
777,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You tell me; and a most uncommon urchin
778,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He must have been to the few seeing ones--
779,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A trifle terrifying, I dare say,"
780,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Discovering a world with his man's eyes,"
781,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Quite as another lad might see some finches,"
782,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If he looked hard and had an eye for nature.
783,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But this one had his eyes and their foretelling,"
784,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And he had you to fare with, and what else?"
785,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He must have had a father and a mother--
786,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In fact I've heard him say so--and a dog,"
787,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As a boy should, I venture; and the dog,"
788,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Most likely, was the only man who knew him."
789,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A dog, for all I know, is what he needs"
790,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As much as anything right here to-day,"
791,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To counsel him about his disillusions,"
792,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Old aches, and parturitions of what's coming,--"
793,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A dog of orders, an emeritus,"
794,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To wag his tail at him when he comes home,"
795,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And then to put his paws up on his knees
796,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And say, ""For God's sake, what's it all about?"""
797,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
798,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I don't know whether he needs a dog or not--
799,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or what he needs.  I tell him he needs Greek;
800,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'll talk of rules and Aristotle with him,"
801,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And if his tongue's at home he'll say to that,"
802,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I have your word that Aristotle knows,"
803,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you mine that I don't know Aristotle."""
804,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He's all at odds with all the unities,"
805,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And what's yet worse, it doesn't seem to matter;"
806,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He treads along through Time's old wilderness
807,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As if the tramp of all the centuries
808,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Had left no roads--and there are none, for him;"
809,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He doesn't see them, even with those eyes,--"
810,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And that's a pity, or I say it is."
811,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Accordingly we have him as we have him--
812,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Going his way, the way that he goes best,"
813,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A pleasant animal with no great noise
814,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or nonsense anywhere to set him off--
815,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Save only divers and inclement devils
816,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Have made of late his heart their dwelling place.
817,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A flame half ready to fly out sometimes
818,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"At some annoyance may be fanned up in him,"
819,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But soon it falls, and when it falls goes out;"
820,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He knows how little room there is in there
821,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For crude and futile animosities,"
822,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And how much for the joy of being whole,"
823,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And how much for long sorrow and old pain.
824,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On our side there are some who may be given
825,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To grow old wondering what he thinks of us
826,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And some above us, who are, in his eyes,"
827,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Above himself,--and that's quite right and English."
828,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Yet here we smile, or disappoint the gods"
829,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who made it so:  the gods have always eyes
830,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To see men scratch; and they see one down here
831,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who itches, manor-bitten to the bone,"
832,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Albeit he knows himself--yes, yes, he knows--"
833,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The lord of more than England and of more
834,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than all the seas of England in all time
835,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Shall ever wash.  D'ye wonder that I laugh?
836,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He sees me, and he doesn't seem to care;"
837,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And why the devil should he?  I can't tell you.
838,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
839,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I'll meet him out alone of a bright Sunday,"
840,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Trim, rather spruce, and quite the gentleman."
841,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""What ho, my lord!"" say I.  He doesn't hear me;"
842,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Wherefore I have to pause and look at him.
843,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He's not enormous, but one looks at him."
844,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A little on the round if you insist,"
845,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For now, God save the mark, he's growing old;"
846,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He's five and forty, and to hear him talk"
847,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,These days you'd call him eighty; then you'd add
848,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,More years to that.  He's old enough to be
849,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The father of a world, and so he is."
850,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Ben, you're a scholar, what's the time of day?"""
851,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Says he; and there shines out of him again
852,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,An aged light that has no age or station--
853,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The mystery that's his--a mischievous
854,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Half-mad serenity that laughs at fame
855,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For being won so easy, and at friends"
856,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who laugh at him for what he wants the most,"
857,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And for his dukedom down in Warwickshire;--
858,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,By which you see we're all a little jealous....
859,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Poor Greene!  I fear the color of his name
860,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was even as that of his ascending soul;
861,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And he was one where there are many others,--"
862,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Some scrivening to the end against their fate,"
863,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Their puppets all in ink and all to die there;
864,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And some with hands that once would shade an eye
865,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That scanned Euripides and Aeschylus
866,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Will reach by this time for a pot-house mop
867,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To slush their first and last of royalties.
868,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Poor devils! and they all play to his hand;
869,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For so it was in Athens and old Rome.
870,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But that's not here or there; I've wandered off.
871,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Greene does it, or I'm careful.  Where's that boy?"
872,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
873,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Yes, he'll go back to Stratford.  And we'll miss him?"
874,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Dear sir, there'll be no London here without him."
875,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We'll all be riding, one of these fine days,"
876,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Down there to see him--and his wife won't like us;
877,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And then we'll think of what he never said
878,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of women--which, if taken all in all"
879,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With what he did say, would buy many horses."
880,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though nowadays he's not so much for women:
881,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""So few of them,"" he says, ""are worth the guessing."""
882,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But there's a work at work when he says that,"
883,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And while he says it one feels in the air
884,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A deal of circumambient hocus-pocus.
885,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"They've had him dancing till his toes were tender,"
886,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And he can feel 'em now, come chilly rains."
887,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"There's no long cry for going into it,"
888,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"However, and we don't know much about it."
889,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The Fitton thing was worst of all, I fancy;"
890,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you in Stratford, like most here in London,"
891,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Have more now in the 'Sonnets' than you paid for;
892,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He's put her there with all her poison on,"
893,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To make a singing fiction of a shadow
894,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That's in his life a fact, and always will be."
895,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But she's no care of ours, though Time, I fear,"
896,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Will have a more reverberant ado
897,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,About her than about another one
898,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who seems to have decoyed him, married him,"
899,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And sent him scuttling on his way to London,--"
900,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With much already learned, and more to learn,"
901,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And more to follow.  Lord! how I see him now,"
902,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Pretending, maybe trying, to be like us."
903,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Whatever he may have meant, we never had him;"
904,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He failed us, or escaped, or what you will,--"
905,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And there was that about him (God knows what,--"
906,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We'd flayed another had he tried it on us)
907,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That made as many of us as had wits
908,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,More fond of all his easy distances
909,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than one another's noise and clap-your-shoulder.
910,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But think you not, my friend, he'd never talk!"
911,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Talk?  He was eldritch at it; and we listened--
912,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Thereby acquiring much we knew before
913,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"About ourselves, and hitherto had held"
914,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Irrelevant, or not prime to the purpose."
915,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And there were some, of course, and there be now,"
916,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Disordered and reduced amazedly
917,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To resignation by the mystic seal
918,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of young finality the gods had laid
919,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On everything that made him a young demon;
920,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And one or two shot looks at him already
921,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As he had been their executioner;
922,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And once or twice he was, not knowing it,--"
923,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or knowing, being sorry for poor clay"
924,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And saying nothing....  Yet, for all his engines,"
925,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You'll meet a thousand of an afternoon
926,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who strut and sun themselves and see around 'em
927,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A world made out of more that has a reason
928,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Than his, I swear, that he sees here to-day;"
929,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though he may scarcely give a Fool an exit
930,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But we mark how he sees in everything
931,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A law that, given we flout it once too often,"
932,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Brings fire and iron down on our naked heads.
933,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To me it looks as if the power that made him,"
934,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For fear of giving all things to one creature,"
935,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Left out the first,--faith, innocence, illusion,"
936,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Whatever 'tis that keeps us out o' Bedlam,--"
937,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And thereby, for his too consuming vision,"
938,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Empowered him out of nature; though to see him,"
939,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You'd never guess what's going on inside him.
940,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He'll break out some day like a keg of ale
941,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With too much independent frenzy in it;
942,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And all for cellaring what he knows won't keep,"
943,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And what he'd best forget--but that he can't.
944,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You'll have it, and have more than I'm foretelling;"
945,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And there'll be such a roaring at the Globe
946,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As never stunned the bleeding gladiators.
947,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He'll have to change the color of its hair
948,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A bit, for now he calls it Cleopatra."
949,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Black hair would never do for Cleopatra.
950,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
951,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But you and I are not yet two old women,"
952,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And you're a man of office.  What he does
953,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Is more to you than how it is he does it,--"
954,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And that's what the Lord God has never told him.
955,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"They work together, and the Devil helps 'em;"
956,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"They do it of a morning, or if not,"
957,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They do it of a night; in which event
958,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He's peevish of a morning.  He seems old;
959,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He's not the proper stomach or the sleep--
960,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And they're two sovran agents to conserve him
961,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Against the fiery art that has no mercy
962,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But what's in that prodigious grand new House.
963,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I gather something happening in his boyhood
964,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Fulfilled him with a boy's determination
965,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To make all Stratford 'ware of him.  Well, well,"
966,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I hope at last he'll have his joy of it,"
967,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves,"
968,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And frogs and owls and unicorns, moreover,"
969,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Be less than hell to his attendant ears.
970,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Oh, past a doubt we'll all go down to see him."
971,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
972,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may be wise.  With London two days off,"
973,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Down there some wind of heaven may yet revive him;
974,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But there's no quickening breath from anywhere
975,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Shall make of him again the poised young faun
976,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From Warwickshire, who'd made, it seems, already"
977,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A legend of himself before I came
978,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To blink before the last of his first lightning.
979,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Whatever there be, they'll be no more of that;"
980,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The coming on of his old monster Time
981,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Has made him a still man; and he has dreams
982,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Were fair to think on once, and all found hollow."
983,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He knows how much of what men paint themselves
984,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would blister in the light of what they are;
985,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He sees how much of what was great now shares
986,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,An eminence transformed and ordinary;
987,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He knows too much of what the world has hushed
988,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In others, to be loud now for himself;"
989,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He knows now at what height low enemies
990,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"May reach his heart, and high friends let him fall;"
991,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But what not even such as he may know
992,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bedevils him the worst:  his lark may sing
993,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"At heaven's gate how he will, and for as long"
994,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As joy may listen; but HE sees no gate,"
995,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Save one whereat the spent clay waits a little
996,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Before the churchyard has it, and the worm."
997,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Not long ago, late in an afternoon,"
998,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I came on him unseen down Lambeth way,"
999,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And on my life I was afear'd of him:
1000,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He gloomed and mumbled like a soul from Tophet,"
1001,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,His hands behind him and his head bent solemn.
1002,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""What is it now,"" said I,--""another woman?"""
1003,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That made him sorry for me, and he smiled."
1004,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""No, Ben,"" he mused; ""it's Nothing.  It's all Nothing."
1005,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We come, we go; and when we're done, we're done;"
1006,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Spiders and flies--we're mostly one or t'other--
1007,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We come, we go; and when we're done, we're done."""
1008,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""By God, you sing that song as if you knew it!"""
1009,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Said I, by way of cheering him; ""what ails ye?"""
1010,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I think I must have come down here to think,"""
1011,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Says he to that, and pulls his little beard;"
1012,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Your fly will serve as well as anybody,"
1013,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And what's his hour?  He flies, and flies, and flies,"
1014,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And in his fly's mind has a brave appearance;
1015,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And then your spider gets him in her net,"
1016,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And eats him out, and hangs him up to dry."
1017,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That's Nature, the kind mother of us all."
1018,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And then your slattern housemaid swings her broom,"
1019,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And where's your spider?  And that's Nature, also."
1020,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"It's Nature, and it's Nothing.  It's all Nothing."
1021,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,It's all a world where bugs and emperors
1022,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Go singularly back to the same dust,"
1023,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Each in his time; and the old, ordered stars"
1024,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That sang together, Ben, will sing the same"
1025,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Old stave to-morrow."""
1026,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1027,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"When he talks like that,"
1028,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's nothing for a human man to do
1029,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But lead him to some grateful nook like this
1030,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Where we be now, and there to make him drink."
1031,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He'll drink, for love of me, and then be sick;"
1032,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A sad sign always in a man of parts,"
1033,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And always very ominous.  The great
1034,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Should be as large in liquor as in love,--"
1035,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And our great friend is not so large in either:
1036,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"One disaffects him, and the other fails him;"
1037,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Whatso he drinks that has an antic in it,"
1038,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He's wondering what's to pay in his insides;
1039,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And while his eyes are on the Cyprian
1040,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He's fribbling all the time with that damned House.
1041,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We laugh here at his thrift, but after all"
1042,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,It may be thrift that saves him from the devil;
1043,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"God gave it, anyhow,--and we'll suppose"
1044,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He knew the compound of his handiwork.
1045,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To-day the clouds are with him, but anon"
1046,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He'll out of 'em enough to shake the tree
1047,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of life itself and bring down fruit unheard-of,--"
1048,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And, throwing in the bruised and whole together,"
1049,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Prepare a wine to make us drunk with wonder;
1050,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And if he live, there'll be a sunset spell"
1051,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Thrown over him as over a glassed lake
1052,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That yesterday was all a black wild water.
1053,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1054,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"God send he live to give us, if no more,"
1055,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What now's a-rampage in him, and exhibit,"
1056,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With a decent half-allegiance to the ages
1057,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,An earnest of at least a casual eye
1058,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Turned once on what he owes to Gutenberg,"
1059,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And to the fealty of more centuries
1060,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than are as yet a picture in our vision.
1061,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""There's time enough,--I'll do it when I'm old,"
1062,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And we're immortal men,"" he says to that;"
1063,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And then he says to me, ""Ben, what's 'immortal'?"
1064,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Think you by any force of ordination
1065,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,It may be nothing of a sort more noisy
1066,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than a small oblivion of component ashes
1067,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That of a dream-addicted world was once
1068,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A moving atomy much like your friend here?"""
1069,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Nothing will help that man.  To make him laugh,"
1070,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I said then he was a mad mountebank,--"
1071,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And by the Lord I nearer made him cry.
1072,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I could have eat an eft then, on my knees,"
1073,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Tail, claws, and all of him; for I had stung"
1074,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The king of men, who had no sting for me,"
1075,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And I had hurt him in his memories;
1076,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And I say now, as I shall say again,"
1077,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I love the man this side idolatry.
1078,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1079,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He'll do it when he's old, he says.  I wonder."
1080,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may not be so ancient as all that.
1081,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For such as he, the thing that is to do"
1082,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Will do itself,--but there's a reckoning;"
1083,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The sessions that are now too much his own,"
1084,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The roiling inward of a stilled outside,"
1085,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The churning out of all those blood-fed lines,"
1086,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The nights of many schemes and little sleep,"
1087,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The full brain hammered hot with too much thinking,"
1088,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The vexed heart over-worn with too much aching,--"
1089,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,This weary jangling of conjoined affairs
1090,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Made out of elements that have no end,"
1091,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And all confused at once, I understand,"
1092,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Is not what makes a man to live forever.
1093,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"O no, not now!  He'll not be going now:"
1094,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There'll be time yet for God knows what explosions
1095,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Before he goes.  He'll stay awhile.  Just wait:
1096,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Just wait a year or two for Cleopatra,"
1097,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For she's to be a balsam and a comfort;
1098,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And that's not all a jape of mine now, either."
1099,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For granted once the old way of Apollo
1100,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Sings in a man, he may then, if he's able,"
1101,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Strike unafraid whatever strings he will
1102,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Upon the last and wildest of new lyres;
1103,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Nor out of his new magic, though it hymn"
1104,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The shrieks of dungeoned hell, shall he create"
1105,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A madness or a gloom to shut quite out
1106,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A cleaving daylight, and a last great calm"
1107,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Triumphant over shipwreck and all storms.
1108,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He might have given Aristotle creeps,"
1109,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But surely would have given him his 'katharsis'.
1110,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1111,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He'll not be going yet.  There's too much yet
1112,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Unsung within the man.  But when he goes,"
1113,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I'd stake ye coin o' the realm his only care
1114,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For a phantom world he sounded and found wanting
1115,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Will be a portion here, a portion there,"
1116,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of this or that thing or some other thing
1117,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That has a patent and intrinsical
1118,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Equivalence in those egregious shillings.
1119,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And yet he knows, God help him!  Tell me, now,"
1120,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If ever there was anything let loose
1121,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On earth by gods or devils heretofore
1122,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Like this mad, careful, proud, indifferent Shakespeare!"
1123,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Where was it, if it ever was?  By heaven,"
1124,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,'Twas never yet in Rhodes or Pergamon--
1125,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In Thebes or Nineveh, a thing like this!"
1126,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No thing like this was ever out of England;
1127,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And that he knows.  I wonder if he cares.
1128,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Perhaps he does....  O Lord, that House in Stratford!"
1129,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1130,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1131,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1132,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1133,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Eros Turannos
1134,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1135,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1136,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1137,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She fears him, and will always ask"
1138,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What fated her to choose him;
1139,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,She meets in his engaging mask
1140,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,All reasons to refuse him;
1141,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But what she meets and what she fears
1142,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Are less than are the downward years,"
1143,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Drawn slowly to the foamless weirs
1144,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of age, were she to lose him."
1145,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1146,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Between a blurred sagacity
1147,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That once had power to sound him,"
1148,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And Love, that will not let him be"
1149,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The Judas that she found him,"
1150,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Her pride assuages her almost,"
1151,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As if it were alone the cost.--
1152,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He sees that he will not be lost,"
1153,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And waits and looks around him.
1154,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1155,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A sense of ocean and old trees
1156,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Envelops and allures him;
1157,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Tradition, touching all he sees,"
1158,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Beguiles and reassures him;
1159,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And all her doubts of what he says
1160,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Are dimmed of what she knows of days--
1161,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Till even prejudice delays
1162,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And fades, and she secures him."
1163,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1164,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The falling leaf inaugurates
1165,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The reign of her confusion;
1166,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The pounding wave reverberates
1167,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The dirge of her illusion;
1168,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And home, where passion lived and died,"
1169,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Becomes a place where she can hide,"
1170,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,While all the town and harbor side
1171,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Vibrate with her seclusion.
1172,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1173,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We tell you, tapping on our brows,"
1174,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The story as it should be,--"
1175,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As if the story of a house
1176,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Were told, or ever could be;"
1177,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We'll have no kindly veil between
1178,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Her visions and those we have seen,--"
1179,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As if we guessed what hers have been,"
1180,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or what they are or would be.
1181,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1182,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Meanwhile we do no harm; for they
1183,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That with a god have striven,"
1184,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Not hearing much of what we say,"
1185,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Take what the god has given;
1186,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Though like waves breaking it may be,"
1187,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or like a changed familiar tree,"
1188,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or like a stairway to the sea
1189,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Where down the blind are driven.

1197,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1198,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1199,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1200,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I met him, as one meets a ghost or two,"
1201,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Between the gray Arch and the old Hotel.
1202,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""King Solomon was right, there's nothing new,"""
1203,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Said he.  ""Behold a ruin who meant well."""
1204,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1205,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He led me down familiar steps again,"
1206,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Appealingly, and set me in a chair."
1207,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""My dreams have all come true to other men,"""
1208,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Said he; ""God lives, however, and why care?"
1209,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1210,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""An hour among the ghosts will do no harm."""
1211,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He laughed, and something glad within me sank."
1212,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I may have eyed him with a faint alarm,"
1213,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For now his laugh was lost in what he drank.
1214,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1215,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""They chill things here with ice from hell,"" he said;"
1216,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I might have known it.""  And he made a face"
1217,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That showed again how much of him was dead,"
1218,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And how much was alive and out of place,"
1219,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1220,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And out of reach.  He knew as well as I
1221,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That all the words of wise men who are skilled
1222,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In using them are not much to defy
1223,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What comes when memory meets the unfulfilled.
1224,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1225,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What evil and infirm perversity
1226,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Had been at work with him to bring him back?
1227,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Never among the ghosts, assuredly,"
1228,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would he originate a new attack;
1229,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1230,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Never among the ghosts, or anywhere,"
1231,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Till what was dead of him was put away,"
1232,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would he attain to his offended share
1233,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of honor among others of his day.
1234,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1235,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You ponder like an owl,"" he said at last;"
1236,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You always did, and here you have a cause."
1237,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For I'm a confirmation of the past,"
1238,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A vengeance, and a flowering of what was."
1239,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1240,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Sorry?  Of course you are, though you compress,"
1241,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With even your most impenetrable fears,"
1242,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A placid and a proper consciousness
1243,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of anxious angels over my arrears.
1244,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1245,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I see them there against me in a book"
1246,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As large as hope, in ink that shines by night."
1247,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For sure I see; but now I'd rather look
1248,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"At you, and you are not a pleasant sight."
1249,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1250,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Forbear, forgive.  Ten years are on my soul,"
1251,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And on my conscience.  I've an incubus:
1252,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"My one distinction, and a parlous toll"
1253,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To glory; but hope lives on clamorous.
1254,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1255,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""'Twas hope, though heaven I grant you knows of what--"
1256,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The kind that blinks and rises when it falls,"
1257,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Whether it sees a reason why or not--
1258,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That heard Broadway's hard-throated siren-calls;
1259,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1260,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""'Twas hope that brought me through December storms,"
1261,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To shores again where I'll not have to be
1262,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A lonely man with only foreign worms
1263,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To cheer him in his last obscurity.
1264,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1265,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""But what it was that hurried me down here"
1266,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To be among the ghosts, I leave to you."
1267,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"My thanks are yours, no less, for one thing clear:"
1268,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Though you are silent, what you say is true."
1269,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1270,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""There may have been the devil in my feet,"
1271,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For down I blundered, like a fugitive,"
1272,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To find the old room in Eleventh Street.
1273,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"God save us!--I came here again to live."""
1274,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1275,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We rose at that, and all the ghosts rose then,"
1276,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And followed us unseen to his old room.
1277,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No longer a good place for living men
1278,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"We found it, and we shivered in the gloom."
1279,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1280,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The goods he took away from there were few,"
1281,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And soon we found ourselves outside once more,"
1282,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Where now the lamps along the Avenue
1283,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bloomed white for miles above an iron floor.
1284,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1285,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Now lead me to the newest of hotels,"""
1286,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He said, ""and let your spleen be undeceived:"
1287,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"This ruin is not myself, but some one else;"
1288,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I haven't failed; I've merely not achieved."""
1289,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1290,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Whether he knew or not, he laughed and dined"
1291,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With more of an immune regardlessness
1292,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of pits before him and of sands behind
1293,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than many a child at forty would confess;
1294,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1295,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And after, when the bells in 'Boris' rang"
1296,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Their tumult at the Metropolitan,"
1297,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He rocked himself, and I believe he sang."
1298,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""God lives,"" he crooned aloud, ""and I'm the man!"""
1299,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1300,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He was.  And even though the creature spoiled
1301,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"All prophecies, I cherish his acclaim."
1302,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Three weeks he fattened; and five years he toiled
1303,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In Yonkers,--and then sauntered into fame."
1304,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1305,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he may go now to what streets he will--
1306,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Eleventh, or the last, and little care;"
1307,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But he would find the old room very still
1308,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of evenings, and the ghosts would all be there."
1309,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1310,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I doubt if he goes after them; I doubt
1311,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If many of them ever come to him.
1312,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His memories are like lamps, and they go out;"
1313,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or if they burn, they flicker and are dim."
1314,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1315,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A light of other gleams he has to-day
1316,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And adulations of applauding hosts;
1317,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A famous danger, but a safer way"
1318,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than growing old alone among the ghosts.
1319,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1320,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But we may still be glad that we were wrong:
1321,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He fooled us, and we'd shrivel to deny it;"
1322,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Though sometimes when old echoes ring too long,"
1323,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I wish the bells in 'Boris' would be quiet.

1333,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Beheld her first, he found her fair:"
1334,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No promise ever dreamt in heaven
1335,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Could then have lured him anywhere
1336,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That would have been away from there;
1337,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And all his wits had lightly striven,"
1338,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Foiled with her voice, and eyes, and hair."
1339,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1340,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's nothing in the saints and sages
1341,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To meet the shafts her glances had,"
1342,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or such as hers have had for ages
1343,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To blind a man till he be glad,"
1344,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And humble him till he be mad.
1345,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The story would have many pages,"
1346,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And would be neither good nor bad.
1347,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1348,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And, having followed, you would find him"
1349,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Where properly the play begins;
1350,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But look for no red light behind him--
1351,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"No fumes of many-colored sins,"
1352,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Fanned high by screaming violins.
1353,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"God knows what good it was to blind him,"
1354,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or whether man or woman wins.
1355,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1356,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And by the same eternal token,"
1357,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who knows just how it will all end?--
1358,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"This drama of hard words unspoken,"
1359,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"This fireside farce, without a friend"
1360,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or enemy to comprehend
1361,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What augurs when two lives are broken,"
1362,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And fear finds nothing left to mend.
1363,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1364,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He stares in vain for what awaits him,"
1365,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And sees in Love a coin to toss;
1366,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He smiles, and her cold hush berates him"
1367,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Beneath his hard half of the cross;
1368,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They wonder why it ever was;
1369,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And she, the unforgiving, hates him"
1370,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,More for her lack than for her loss.
1371,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1372,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He feeds with pride his indecision,"
1373,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And shrinks from what will not occur,"
1374,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bequeathing with infirm derision
1375,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His ashes to the days that were,"
1376,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Before she made him prisoner;
1377,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And labors to retrieve the vision
1378,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That he must once have had of her.
1379,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1380,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He waits, and there awaits an ending,"
1381,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he knows neither what nor when;
1382,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But no magicians are attending
1383,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To make him see as he saw then,"
1384,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he will never find again
1385,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The face that once had been the rending
1386,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of all his purpose among men.
1387,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1388,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He blames her not, nor does he chide her,"
1389,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And she has nothing new to say;
1390,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"If he were Bluebeard he could hide her,"
1391,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But that's not written in the play,"
1392,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And there will be no change to-day;
1393,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Although, to the serene outsider,"
1394,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There still would seem to be a way.

1404,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Had you the gift of yours, Theophilus?"
1405,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not even a smeared young Cyclops at his games
1406,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Would have you long,--and you are one of us."
1407,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1408,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Told of your deeds I shudder for your dreams,"
1409,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And they, no doubt, are few and innocent."
1410,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Meanwhile, I marvel; for in you, it seems,"
1411,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Heredity outshines environment.
1412,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1413,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What lingering bit of Belial, unforeseen,"
1414,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Survives and amplifies itself in you?
1415,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What manner of devilry has ever been
1416,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That your obliquity may never do?
1417,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1418,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Humility befits a father's eyes,"
1419,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But not a friend of us would have him weep.
1420,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Admiring everything that lives and dies,"
1421,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Theophilus, we like you best asleep."
1422,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1423,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Sleep--sleep; and let us find another man
1424,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To lend another name less hazardous:
1425,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Caligula, maybe, or Caliban,"
1426,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or Cain,--but surely not Theophilus."

1436,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To laugh at them, were she to see them here,"
1437,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So brave and so alert for learning how
1438,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To fence with reason for another year.
1439,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1440,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Age offers a far comelier diadem
1441,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Than theirs; but anguish has no eye for grace,"
1442,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When time's malicious mercy cautions them
1443,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To think a while of number and of space.
1444,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1445,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The burning hope, the worn expectancy,"
1446,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The martyred humor, and the maimed allure,"
1447,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Cry out for time to end his levity,"
1448,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And age to soften its investiture;
1449,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1450,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But they, though others fade and are still fair,"
1451,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Defy their fairness and are unsubdued;
1452,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Although they suffer, they may not forswear"
1453,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The patient ardor of the unpursued.
1454,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1455,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Poor flesh, to fight the calendar so long;"
1456,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Poor vanity, so quaint and yet so brave;"

1468,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To scorch him than hell's engines could awaken,"
1469,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He scanned again, too far to be so near,"
1470,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The fearful seat no man had ever taken.
1471,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1472,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So many other men with older eyes
1473,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than his to see with older sight behind them
1474,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Had known so long their one way to be wise,--"
1475,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was any other thing to do than mind them?
1476,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1477,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So many a blasting parallel had seared
1478,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Confusion on his faith,--could he but wonder"
1479,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"If he were mad and right, or if he feared"
1480,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,God's fury told in shafted flame and thunder?
1481,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1482,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There fell one day upon his eyes a light
1483,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Ethereal, and he heard no more men speaking;"
1484,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He saw their shaken heads, but no long sight"
1485,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was his but for the end that he went seeking.
1486,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1487,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The end he sought was not the end; the crown
1488,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He won shall unto many still be given.
1489,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Moreover, there was reason here to frown:"

1501,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You may, for me, be prowling anywhere,"
1502,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So long as you show not your little head:
1503,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No dark and evil story of the dead
1504,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would leave you less pernicious or less fair--
1505,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Not even Lilith, with her famous hair;"
1506,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And Lilith was the devil, I have read."
1507,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I cannot hate you, for I loved you then."
1508,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The woods were golden then.  There was a road
1509,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Through beeches; and I said their smooth feet showed
1510,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Like yours.  Truth must have heard me from afar,"
1511,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For I shall never have to learn again
1512,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That yours are cloven as no beech's are.

1521,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She'd look upon us, if she could,"
1522,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As hard as Rhadamanthus would;
1523,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Yet one may see,--who sees her face,"
1524,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Her crown of silver and of lace,"
1525,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her mystical serene address
1526,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of age alloyed with loveliness,--"
1527,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That she would not annihilate
1528,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The frailest of things animate.
1529,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1530,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She has opinions of our ways,"
1531,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And if we're not all mad, she says,--"
1532,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If our ways are not wholly worse
1533,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Than others, for not being hers,--"
1534,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There might somehow be found a few
1535,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Less insane things for us to do,"
1536,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And we might have a little heed
1537,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of what Belshazzar couldn't read.
1538,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1539,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She feels, with all our furniture,"
1540,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Room yet for something more secure
1541,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than our self-kindled aureoles
1542,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To guide our poor forgotten souls;
1543,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But when we have explained that grace
1544,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Dwells now in doing for the race,"
1545,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,She nods--as if she were relieved;
1546,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Almost as if she were deceived.
1547,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1548,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She frowns at much of what she hears,"
1549,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And shakes her head, and has her fears;"
1550,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Though none may know, by any chance,"
1551,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What rose-leaf ashes of romance
1552,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Are faintly stirred by later days
1553,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That would be well enough, she says,"
1554,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"If only people were more wise,"

1562,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1563,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1564,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Where a faint light shines alone,"
1565,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Dwells a Demon I have known.
1566,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Most of you had better say
1567,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""The Dark House"", and go your way."
1568,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Do not wonder if I stay.
1569,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1570,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For I know the Demon's eyes,"
1571,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And their lure that never dies.
1572,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Banish all your fond alarms,"
1573,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For I know the foiling charms
1574,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of her eyes and of her arms,"
1575,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1576,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And I know that in one room
1577,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Burns a lamp as in a tomb;
1578,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And I see the shadow glide,"
1579,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Back and forth, of one denied"
1580,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Power to find himself outside.
1581,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1582,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"There he is who is my friend,"
1583,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Damned, he fancies, to the end--"
1584,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Vanquished, ever since a door"
1585,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Closed, he thought, for evermore"
1586,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On the life that was before.
1587,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1588,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And the friend who knows him best
1589,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Sees him as he sees the rest
1590,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who are striving to be wise
1591,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,While a Demon's arms and eyes
1592,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Hold them as a web would flies.
1593,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1594,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"All the words of all the world,"
1595,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Aimed together and then hurled,"
1596,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would be stiller in his ears
1597,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than a closing of still shears
1598,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On a thread made out of years.
1599,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1600,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But there lives another sound,"
1601,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"More compelling, more profound;"
1602,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"There's a music, so it seems,"
1603,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That assuages and redeems,"
1604,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"More than reason, more than dreams."
1605,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1606,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's a music yet unheard
1607,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"By the creature of the word,"
1608,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though it matters little more
1609,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than a wave-wash on a shore--
1610,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Till a Demon shuts a door.
1611,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1612,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"So, if he be very still"
1613,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With his Demon, and one will,"
1614,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Murmurs of it may be blown
1615,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To my friend who is alone
1616,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In a room that I have known.
1617,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1618,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,After that from everywhere
1619,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Singing life will find him there;
1620,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Then the door will open wide,"
1621,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And my friend, again outside,"
1622,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Will be living, having died."
1623,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1624,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1625,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1626,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1627,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The Poor Relation
1628,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1629,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1630,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1631,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No longer torn by what she knows
1632,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And sees within the eyes of others,"
1633,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Her doubts are when the daylight goes,"
1634,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her fears are for the few she bothers.
1635,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,She tells them it is wholly wrong
1636,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of her to stay alive so long;
1637,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And when she smiles her forehead shows
1638,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A crinkle that had been her mother's.
1639,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1640,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Beneath her beauty, blanched with pain,"
1641,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And wistful yet for being cheated,"
1642,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A child would seem to ask again
1643,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A question many times repeated;
1644,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But no rebellion has betrayed
1645,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her wonder at what she has paid
1646,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For memories that have no stain,"
1647,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For triumph born to be defeated.
1648,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1649,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To those who come for what she was--
1650,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The few left who know where to find her--
1651,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She clings, for they are all she has;"
1652,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And she may smile when they remind her,"
1653,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As heretofore, of what they know"
1654,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of roses that are still to blow
1655,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,By ways where not so much as grass
1656,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Remains of what she sees behind her.
1657,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1658,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"They stay a while, and having done"
1659,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What penance or the past requires,"
1660,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"They go, and leave her there alone"
1661,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To count her chimneys and her spires.
1662,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Her lip shakes when they go away,"
1663,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And yet she would not have them stay;
1664,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,She knows as well as anyone
1665,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That Pity, having played, soon tires."
1666,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1667,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But one friend always reappears,"
1668,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A good ghost, not to be forsaken;"
1669,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Whereat she laughs and has no fears
1670,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of what a ghost may reawaken,"
1671,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But welcomes, while she wears and mends"
1672,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The poor relation's odds and ends,"
1673,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her truant from a tomb of years--
1674,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her power of youth so early taken.
1675,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1676,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Poor laugh, more slender than her song"
1677,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,It seems; and there are none to hear it
1678,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With even the stopped ears of the strong
1679,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For breaking heart or broken spirit.
1680,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The friends who clamored for her place,"
1681,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And would have scratched her for her face,"
1682,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Have lost her laughter for so long
1683,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That none would care enough to fear it.
1684,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1685,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,None live who need fear anything
1686,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From her, whose losses are their pleasure;"
1687,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The plover with a wounded wing
1688,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Stays not the flight that others measure;
1689,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"So there she waits, and while she lives,"
1690,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And death forgets, and faith forgives,"
1691,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Her memories go foraging
1692,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For bits of childhood song they treasure.
1693,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1694,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And like a giant harp that hums
1695,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"On always, and is always blending"
1696,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The coming of what never comes
1697,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With what has past and had an ending,"
1698,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The City trembles, throbs, and pounds"
1699,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Outside, and through a thousand sounds"
1700,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The small intolerable drums
1701,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of Time are like slow drops descending.
1702,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1703,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bereft enough to shame a sage
1704,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And given little to long sighing,"
1705,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With no illusion to assuage
1706,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The lonely changelessness of dying,--"
1707,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Unsought, unthought-of, and unheard,"
1708,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"She sings and watches like a bird,"
1709,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Safe in a comfortable cage
1710,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,From which there will be no more flying.
1711,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1712,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,

1714,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1715,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The Burning Book
1716,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1717,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or the Contented Metaphysician
1718,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1719,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1720,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1721,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To the lore of no manner of men
1722,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Would his vision have yielded
1723,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When he found what will never again
1724,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From his vision be shielded,--"
1725,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though he paid with as much of his life
1726,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As a nun could have given,"
1727,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And to-night would have been as a knife,"
1728,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Devil-drawn, devil-driven."
1729,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1730,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For to-night, with his flame-weary eyes"
1731,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"On the work he is doing,"
1732,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He considers the tinder that flies
1733,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And the quick flame pursuing.
1734,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In the leaves that are crinkled and curled
1735,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Are his ashes of glory,"
1736,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And what once were an end of the world
1737,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Is an end of a story.
1738,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1739,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But he smiles, for no more shall his days"
1740,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Be a toil and a calling
1741,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For a way to make others to gaze
1742,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,On God's face without falling.
1743,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He has come to the end of his words,"
1744,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And alone he rejoices
1745,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In the choiring that silence affords
1746,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of ineffable voices.
1747,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1748,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To a realm that his words may not reach
1749,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may lead none to find him;
1750,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"An adept, and with nothing to teach,"
1751,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He leaves nothing behind him.
1752,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For the rest, he will have his release,"
1753,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And his embers, attended"
1754,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,By the large and unclamoring peace
1755,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of a dream that is ended.
1756,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1757,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,

1761,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1762,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1763,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1764,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Faint white pillars that seem to fade
1765,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As you look from here are the first one sees
1766,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of his house where it hides and dies in a shade
1767,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of beeches and oaks and hickory trees.
1768,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Now many a man, given woods like these,"
1769,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And a house like that, and the Briony gold,"
1770,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Would have said, ""There are still some gods to please,"
1771,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And houses are built without hands, we're told."""
1772,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1773,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"There are the pillars, and all gone gray."
1774,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Briony's hair went white.  You may see
1775,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Where the garden was if you come this way.
1776,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That sun-dial scared him, he said to me;"
1777,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Sooner or later they strike,"" said he,"
1778,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he never got that from the books he read.
1779,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Others are flourishing, worse than he,"
1780,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But he knew too much for the life he led.
1781,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1782,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And who knows all knows everything
1783,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That a patient ghost at last retrieves;
1784,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's more to be known of his harvesting
1785,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When Time the thresher unbinds the sheaves;
1786,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And there's more to be heard than a wind that grieves
1787,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For Briony now in this ageless oak,"
1788,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Driving the first of its withered leaves
1789,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Over the stones where the fountain broke.
1790,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1791,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1792,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1793,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1794,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Lisette and Eileen
1795,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1796,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1797,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1798,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""When he was here alive, Eileen,"
1799,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There was a word you might have said;
1800,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"So never mind what I have been,"
1801,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or anything,--for you are dead."
1802,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1803,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""And after this when I am there"
1804,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Where he is, you'll be dying still."
1805,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Your eyes are dead, and your black hair,--"
1806,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The rest of you be what it will.
1807,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1808,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""'Twas all to save him?  Never mind,"
1809,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Eileen.  You saved him.  You are strong.
1810,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I'd hardly wonder if your kind
1811,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Paid everything, for you live long."
1812,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1813,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You last, I mean.  That's what I mean."
1814,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I mean you last as long as lies.
1815,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You might have said that word, Eileen,--"
1816,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And you might have your hair and eyes.
1817,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1818,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""And what you see might be Lisette,"
1819,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Instead of this that has no name.
1820,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Your silence--I can feel it yet,"
1821,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Alive and in me, like a flame."
1822,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1823,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Where might I be with him to-day,"
1824,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Could he have known before he heard?
1825,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But no--your silence had its way,"
1826,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Without a weapon or a word.
1827,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1828,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Because a word was never told,"
1829,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I'm going as a worn toy goes.
1830,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And you are dead; and you'll be old;
1831,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And I forgive you, I suppose."
1832,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1833,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I'll soon be changing as all do,"
1834,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To something we have always been;
1835,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you'll be old...  He liked you, too."
1836,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I might have killed you then, Eileen."
1837,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1838,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""I think he liked as much of you"
1839,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As had a reason to be seen,--"
1840,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As much as God made black and blue.
1841,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He liked your hair and eyes, Eileen."""

1845,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1846,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Llewellyn and the Tree
1847,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1848,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1849,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1850,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Could he have made Priscilla share
1851,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The paradise that he had planned,"
1852,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Llewellyn would have loved his wife
1853,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As well as any in the land.
1854,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1855,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Could he have made Priscilla cease
1856,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To goad him for what God left out,"
1857,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Llewellyn would have been as mild
1858,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As any we have read about.
1859,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1860,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Could all have been as all was not,"
1861,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Llewellyn would have had no story;
1862,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He would have stayed a quiet man
1863,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And gone his quiet way to glory.
1864,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1865,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But howsoever mild he was
1866,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Priscilla was implacable;
1867,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And whatsoever timid hopes
1868,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He built--she found them, and they fell."
1869,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1870,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And this went on, with intervals"
1871,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of labored harmony between
1872,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Resounding discords, till at last"
1873,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Llewellyn turned--as will be seen.
1874,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1875,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Priscilla, warmer than her name,"
1876,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And shriller than the sound of saws,"
1877,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Pursued Llewellyn once too far,"
1878,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not knowing quite the man he was.
1879,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1880,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The more she said, the fiercer clung"
1881,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The stinging garment of his wrath;
1882,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And this was all before the day
1883,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When Time tossed roses in his path.
1884,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1885,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Before the roses ever came
1886,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Llewellyn had already risen.
1887,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The roses may have ruined him,"
1888,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They may have kept him out of prison.
1889,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1890,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And she who brought them, being Fate,"
1891,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Made roses do the work of spears,--"
1892,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though many made no more of her
1893,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Than civet, coral, rouge, and years."
1894,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1895,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You ask us what Llewellyn saw,"
1896,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But why ask what may not be given?
1897,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To some will come a time when change
1898,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Itself is beauty, if not heaven."
1899,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1900,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"One afternoon Priscilla spoke,"
1901,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And her shrill history was done;
1902,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"At any rate, she never spoke"
1903,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Like that again to anyone.
1904,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1905,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,One gold October afternoon
1906,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Great fury smote the silent air;
1907,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And then Llewellyn leapt and fled
1908,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Like one with hornets in his hair.
1909,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1910,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Llewellyn left us, and he said"
1911,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Forever, leaving few to doubt him;"
1912,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And so, through frost and clicking leaves,"
1913,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The Tilbury way went on without him.
1914,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1915,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And slowly, through the Tilbury mist,"
1916,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The stillness of October gold
1917,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Went out like beauty from a face.
1918,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Priscilla watched it, and grew old."
1919,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1920,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He fled, still clutching in his flight"
1921,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The roses that had been his fall;
1922,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The Scarlet One, as you surmise,"
1923,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Fled with him, coral, rouge, and all."
1924,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1925,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Priscilla, waiting, saw the change"
1926,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of twenty slow October moons;
1927,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And then she vanished, in her turn"
1928,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To be forgotten, like old tunes."
1929,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1930,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"So they were gone--all three of them,"
1931,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I should have said, and said no more,"
1932,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Had not a face once on Broadway
1933,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Been one that I had seen before.
1934,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1935,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The face and hands and hair were old,"
1936,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But neither time nor penury
1937,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Could quench within Llewellyn's eyes
1938,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The shine of his one victory.
1939,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1940,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The roses, faded and gone by,"
1941,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Left ruin where they once had reigned;
1942,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But on the wreck, as on old shells,"
1943,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The color of the rose remained.
1944,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1945,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,His fictive merchandise I bought
1946,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For him to keep and show again,"
1947,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Then led him slowly from the crush
1948,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of his cold-shouldered fellow men.
1949,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1950,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""And so, Llewellyn,"" I began--"
1951,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Not so,"" he said; ""not so, at all:"
1952,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"I've tried the world, and found it good,"
1953,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For more than twenty years this fall.
1954,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1955,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""And what the world has left of me"
1956,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Will go now in a little while."""
1957,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And what the world had left of him
1958,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Was partly an unholy guile.
1959,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1960,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""That I have paid for being calm"
1961,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Is what you see, if you have eyes;"
1962,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For let a man be calm too long,"
1963,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He pays for much before he dies.
1964,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1965,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Be calm when you are growing old"
1966,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And you have nothing else to do;
1967,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Pour not the wine of life too thin
1968,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If water means the death of you.
1969,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1970,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""You say I might have learned at home"
1971,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The truth in season to be strong?
1972,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not so; I took the wine of life
1973,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Too thin, and I was calm too long."
1974,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1975,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""Like others who are strong too late,"
1976,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For me there was no going back;
1977,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For I had found another speed,"
1978,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And I was on the other track.
1979,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1980,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"""God knows how far I might have gone"
1981,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or what there might have been to see;
1982,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"But my speed had a sudden end,"
1983,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And here you have the end of me."""
1984,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1985,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The end or not, it may be now"
1986,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But little farther from the truth
1987,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To say those worn satiric eyes
1988,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Had something of immortal youth.
1989,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1990,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may among the millions here
1991,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Be one; or he may, quite as well,"
1992,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Be gone to find again the Tree
1993,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of Knowledge, out of which he fell."
1994,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
1995,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may be near us, dreaming yet"
1996,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of unrepented rouge and coral;
1997,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or in a grave without a name
1998,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May be as far off as a moral.
1999,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2000,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2001,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2002,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2003,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bewick Finzer
2004,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2005,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2006,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2007,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Time was when his half million drew
2008,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The breath of six per cent;
2009,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But soon the worm of what-was-not
2010,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Fed hard on his content;
2011,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And something crumbled in his brain
2012,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When his half million went.
2013,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2014,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Time passed, and filled along with his"
2015,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The place of many more;
2016,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Time came, and hardly one of us"
2017,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Had credence to restore,"
2018,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From what appeared one day, the man"
2019,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Whom we had known before.
2020,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2021,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The broken voice, the withered neck,"
2022,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The coat worn out with care,"
2023,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The cleanliness of indigence,"
2024,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The brilliance of despair,"
2025,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The fond imponderable dreams
2026,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of affluence,--all were there."
2027,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2028,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Poor Finzer, with his dreams and schemes,"
2029,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Fares hard now in the race,"
2030,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With heart and eye that have a task
2031,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When he looks in the face
2032,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of one who might so easily
2033,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Have been in Finzer's place.
2034,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2035,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He comes unfailing for the loan
2036,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,We give and then forget;
2037,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He comes, and probably for years"
2038,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Will he be coming yet,--"
2039,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Familiar as an old mistake,"
2040,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And futile as regret.
2041,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2042,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2043,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2044,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2045,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Bokardo
2046,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2047,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2048,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2049,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Well, Bokardo, here we are;"
2050,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Make yourself at home.
2051,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Look around--you haven't far
2052,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To look--and why be dumb?
2053,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Not the place that used to be,"
2054,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not so many things to see;
2055,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But there's room for you and me.
2056,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And you--you've come.
2057,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2058,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Talk a little; or, if not,"
2059,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Show me with a sign
2060,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Why it was that you forgot
2061,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What was yours and mine.
2062,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Friends, I gather, are small things"
2063,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In an age when coins are kings;
2064,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Even at that, one hardly flings"
2065,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Friends before swine.
2066,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2067,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Rather strong?  I knew as much,"
2068,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For it made you speak.
2069,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"No offense to swine, as such,"
2070,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But why this hide-and-seek?
2071,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You have something on your side,"
2072,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And you wish you might have died,"
2073,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So you tell me.  And you tried
2074,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,One night last week?
2075,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2076,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You tried hard?  And even then
2077,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Found a time to pause?
2078,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"When you try as hard again,"
2079,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You'll have another cause.
2080,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When you find yourself at odds
2081,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"With all dreamers of all gods,"
2082,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,You may smite yourself with rods--
2083,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But not the laws.
2084,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2085,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Though they seem to show a spite
2086,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Rather devilish,"
2087,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They move on as with a might
2088,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Stronger than your wish.
2089,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Still, however strong they be,"
2090,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They bide man's authority:
2091,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Xerxes, when he flogged the sea,"
2092,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May've scared a fish.
2093,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2094,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"It's a comfort, if you like,"
2095,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To keep honor warm,"
2096,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But as often as you strike
2097,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The laws, you do no harm."
2098,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To the laws, I mean.  To you--"
2099,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That's another point of view,"
2100,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,One you may as well indue
2101,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With some alarm.
2102,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2103,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not the most heroic face
2104,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To present, I grant;"
2105,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Nor will you insure disgrace
2106,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,By fearing what you want.
2107,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Freedom has a world of sides,"
2108,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And if reason once derides
2109,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Courage, then your courage hides"
2110,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A deal of cant.
2111,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2112,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Learn a little to forget
2113,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Life was once a feast;
2114,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You aren't fit for dying yet,"
2115,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,So don't be a beast.
2116,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Few men with a mind will say,"
2117,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Thinking twice, that they can pay"
2118,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Half their debts of yesterday,"
2119,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Or be released.
2120,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2121,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There's a debt now on your mind
2122,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,More than any gold?
2123,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And there's nothing you can find
2124,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Out there in the cold?
2125,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Only--what's his name?--Remorse?
2126,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And Death riding on his horse?
2127,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Well, be glad there's nothing worse"
2128,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than you have told.
2129,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2130,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Leave Remorse to warm his hands
2131,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Outside in the rain.
2132,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As for Death, he understands,"
2133,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he will come again.
2134,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Therefore, till your wits are clear,"
2135,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Flourish and be quiet--here.
2136,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But a devil at each ear
2137,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Will be a strain?
2138,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2139,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Past a doubt they will indeed,"
2140,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,More than you have earned.
2141,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,I say that because you need
2142,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Ablution, being burned?"
2143,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Well, if you must have it so,"
2144,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Your last flight went rather low.
2145,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Better say you had to know
2146,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,What you have learned.
2147,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2148,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And that's over.  Here you are,"
2149,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Battered by the past.
2150,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Time will have his little scar,"
2151,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But the wound won't last.
2152,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Nor shall harrowing surprise
2153,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Find a world without its eyes
2154,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,If a star fades when the skies
2155,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Are overcast.
2156,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2157,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"God knows there are lives enough,"
2158,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Crushed, and too far gone"
2159,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Longer to make sermons of,"
2160,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And those we leave alone.
2161,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Others, if they will, may rend"
2162,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The worn patience of a friend
2163,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who, though smiling, sees the end,"
2164,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With nothing done.
2165,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2166,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But your fervor to be free
2167,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Fled the faith it scorned;
2168,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Death demands a decency
2169,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of you, and you are warned."
2170,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,But for all we give we get
2171,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Mostly blows?  Don't be upset;
2172,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"You, Bokardo, are not yet"
2173,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Consumed or mourned.
2174,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2175,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There'll be falling into view
2176,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Much to rearrange;
2177,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And there'll be a time for you
2178,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To marvel at the change.
2179,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,They that have the least to fear
2180,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Question hardest what is here;
2181,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"When long-hidden skies are clear,"
2182,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The stars look strange.
2183,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2184,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2185,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2186,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2187,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The Man against the Sky
2188,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2189,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2190,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2191,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Between me and the sunset, like a dome"
2192,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Against the glory of a world on fire,"
2193,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Now burned a sudden hill,"
2194,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Bleak, round, and high, by flame-lit height made higher,"
2195,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With nothing on it for the flame to kill
2196,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Save one who moved and was alone up there
2197,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To loom before the chaos and the glare
2198,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As if he were the last god going home
2199,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Unto his last desire.
2200,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Dark, marvelous, and inscrutable he moved on"
2201,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Till down the fiery distance he was gone,--"
2202,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Like one of those eternal, remote things"
2203,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,That range across a man's imaginings
2204,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,When a sure music fills him and he knows
2205,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"What he may say thereafter to few men,--"
2206,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The touch of ages having wrought
2207,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,An echo and a glimpse of what he thought
2208,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A phantom or a legend until then;
2209,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For whether lighted over ways that save,"
2210,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or lured from all repose,"
2211,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"If he go on too far to find a grave,"
2212,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Mostly alone he goes.
2213,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2214,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Even he, who stood where I had found him,"
2215,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"On high with fire all round him,--"
2216,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who moved along the molten west,"
2217,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And over the round hill's crest
2218,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That seemed half ready with him to go down,"
2219,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Flame-bitten and flame-cleft,--"
2220,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As if there were to be no last thing left
2221,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Of a nameless unimaginable town,--"
2222,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Even he who climbed and vanished may have taken
2223,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Down to the perils of a depth not known,"
2224,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From death defended though by men forsaken,"
2225,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The bread that every man must eat alone;
2226,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have walked while others hardly dared
2227,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Look on to see him stand where many fell;
2228,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And upward out of that, as out of hell,"
2229,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have sung and striven
2230,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To mount where more of him shall yet be given,"
2231,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Bereft of all retreat,"
2232,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To sevenfold heat,--"
2233,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,As on a day when three in Dura shared
2234,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"The furnace, and were spared"
2235,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For glory by that king of Babylon
2236,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who made himself so great that God, who heard,"
2237,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Covered him with long feathers, like a bird."
2238,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2239,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Again, he may have gone down easily,"
2240,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"By comfortable altitudes, and found,"
2241,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"As always, underneath him solid ground"
2242,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Whereon to be sufficient and to stand
2243,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Possessed already of the promised land,"
2244,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Far stretched and fair to see:
2245,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A good sight, verily,"
2246,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And one to make the eyes of her who bore him
2247,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Shine glad with hidden tears.
2248,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Why question of his ease of who before him,"
2249,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In one place or another where they left
2250,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Their names as far behind them as their bones,"
2251,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And yet by dint of slaughter toil and theft,"
2252,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And shrewdly sharpened stones,"
2253,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Carved hard the way for his ascendency
2254,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Through deserts of lost years?
2255,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Why trouble him now who sees and hears
2256,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"No more than what his innocence requires,"
2257,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And therefore to no other height aspires
2258,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than one at which he neither quails nor tires?
2259,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may do more by seeing what he sees
2260,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than others eager for iniquities;
2261,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may, by seeing all things for the best,"
2262,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Incite futurity to do the rest.
2263,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2264,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or with an even likelihood,"
2265,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have met with atrabilious eyes
2266,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,The fires of time on equal terms and passed
2267,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Indifferently down, until at last"
2268,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His only kind of grandeur would have been,"
2269,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Apparently, in being seen."
2270,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have had for evil or for good
2271,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,No argument; he may have had no care
2272,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For what without himself went anywhere
2273,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To failure or to glory, and least of all"
2274,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"For such a stale, flamboyant miracle;"
2275,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have been the prophet of an art
2276,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Immovable to old idolatries;
2277,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may have been a player without a part,"
2278,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Annoyed that even the sun should have the skies
2279,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,For such a flaming way to advertise;
2280,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have been a painter sick at heart
2281,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,With Nature's toiling for a new surprise;
2282,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may have been a cynic, who now, for all"
2283,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Of anything divine that his effete
2284,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Negation may have tasted,"
2285,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Saw truth in his own image, rather small,"
2286,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Forbore to fever the ephemeral,"
2287,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Found any barren height a good retreat
2288,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From any swarming street,"
2289,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And in the sun saw power superbly wasted;
2290,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And when the primitive old-fashioned stars
2291,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Came out again to shine on joys and wars
2292,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"More primitive, and all arrayed for doom,"
2293,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have proved a world a sorry thing
2294,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"In his imagining,"
2295,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And life a lighted highway to the tomb.
2296,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2297,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or, mounting with infirm unsearching tread,"
2298,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"His hopes to chaos led,"
2299,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may have stumbled up there from the past,"
2300,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And with an aching strangeness viewed the last
2301,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Abysmal conflagration of his dreams,--"
2302,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A flame where nothing seems
2303,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"To burn but flame itself, by nothing fed;"
2304,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And while it all went out,"
2305,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Not even the faint anodyne of doubt
2306,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May then have eased a painful going down
2307,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"From pictured heights of power and lost renown,"
2308,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Revealed at length to his outlived endeavor
2309,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Remote and unapproachable forever;
2310,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And at his heart there may have gnawed
2311,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Sick memories of a dead faith foiled and flawed
2312,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And long dishonored by the living death
2313,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Assigned alike by chance
2314,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To brutes and hierophants;
2315,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And anguish fallen on those he loved around him
2316,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"May once have dealt the last blow to confound him,"
2317,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"And so have left him as death leaves a child,"
2318,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Who sees it all too near;
2319,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And he who knows no young way to forget
2320,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,May struggle to the tomb unreconciled.
2321,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Whatever suns may rise or set
2322,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,There may be nothing kinder for him here
2323,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Than shafts and agonies;
2324,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And under these
2325,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may cry out and stay on horribly;
2326,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or, seeing in death too small a thing to fear,"
2327,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may go forward like a stoic Roman
2328,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Where pangs and terrors in his pathway lie,--"
2329,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or, seizing the swift logic of a woman,"
2330,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Curse God and die.
2331,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,
2332,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Or maybe there, like many another one"
2333,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Who might have stood aloft and looked ahead,"
2334,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Black-drawn against wild red,"
2335,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"He may have built, unawed by fiery gules"
2336,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That in him no commotion stirred,"
2337,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,A living reason out of molecules
2338,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Why molecules occurred,"
2339,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And one for smiling when he might have sighed
2340,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Had he seen far enough,"
2341,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,And in the same inevitable stuff
2342,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Discovered an odd reason too for pride
2343,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,In being what he must have been by laws
2344,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Infrangible and for no kind of cause.
2345,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Deterred by no confusion or surprise
2346,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,He may have seen with his mechanic eyes
2347,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"A world without a meaning, and had room,"
2348,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"Alone amid magnificence and doom,"
2349,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To build himself an airy monument
2350,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,"That should, or fail him in his vague intent,"
2351,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Outlast an accidental universe--
2352,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,To call it nothing worse--

2440,THE MAN AGAINST THE SKY,Safe cradled in a communal repose
