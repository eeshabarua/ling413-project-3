62,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",My publishers suggested the bringing together of the three poems here
63,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",presented to the reader as being to some extent alike in their general
64,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","character. ""The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay"" is a perfectly intelligible"
65,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","conception, whatever material difficulties it presents. It is"
66,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",conceivable that a being of an order superior to humanity should so
67,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",understand the conditions of matter that he could construct a machine
68,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","which should go to pieces, if not into its constituent atoms, at a given"
69,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",moment of the future. The mind may take a certain pleasure in this
70,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",picture of the impossible. The event follows as a logical consequence of
71,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",the presupposed condition of things.
72,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",
73,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",There is a practical lesson to be got out of the story. Observation
74,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",shows us in what point any particular mechanism is most likely to give
75,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","way. In a wagon, for instance, the weak point is where the axle enters"
76,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","the hub or nave. When the wagon breaks down, three times out of four, I"
77,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","think, it is at this point that the accident occurs. The workman should"
78,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",see to it that this part should never give way; then find the next
79,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","vulnerable place, and so on, until he arrives logically at the perfect"
80,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",result attained by the deacon.

84,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","Unquestionably there is something a little like extravagance in ""How the"
85,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","Old Horse won the Bet,"" which taxes the credulity of experienced"
86,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",horsemen. Still there have been a good many surprises in the history of
87,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",the turf and the trotting course.

89,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",The Godolphin Arabian was taken from ignoble drudgery to become the

91,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",
92,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",Old Dutchman was transferred from between the shafts of a cart to
93,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",become a champion of the American trotters in his time.
94,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",
95,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","""Old Blue,"" a famous Boston horse of the early decades of this century,"
96,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","was said to trot a mile in less than three minutes, but I do not find"
97,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",any exact record of his achievements.
98,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",
99,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",Those who have followed the history of the American trotting horse are
100,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",aware of the wonderful development of speed attained in these last
101,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",years. The lowest time as yet recorded is by Maud S. in 2.08-3/4.

105,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","If there are any anachronisms or other inaccuracies in this story, the"
106,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",reader will please to remember that the narrator's memory is liable to
107,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","be at fault, and if the event recorded interests him, will not worry"
108,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",over any little slips or stumbles.

112,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","The terrible witchcraft drama of 1692 has been seriously treated, as it"
113,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",well deserves to be. The story has been told in two large volumes by
114,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","the Rev. Charles Wentworth Upham, and in a small and more succinct"
115,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","volume, based upon his work, by his daughter-in-law, Caroline E. Upham."
116,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",
117,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","The delusion commonly spoken of, as if it belonged to Salem, was more"
118,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",widely diffused through the towns of Essex County. Looking upon it as a
119,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.","pitiful and long dead and buried superstition, I trust my poem will no"
120,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",more offend the good people of Essex County than Tam O'Shanter worries
121,"BY HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN & CO.",the honest folk of Ayrshire.

228,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,That was built in such a logical way
229,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"It ran a hundred years to a day,"
230,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"And then, of a sudden, it--ah, but stay,"
231,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"I'll tell you what happened without delay,"
232,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Scaring the parson into fits,"
233,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Frightening people out of their wits,--"
234,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Have you ever heard of that, I say?"
235,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
236,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,"
237,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"_Georgius Secundus_ was then alive,--"
238,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,Snuffy old drone from the German hive;
239,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,That was the year when Lisbon-town
240,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Saw the earth open and gulp her down,"
241,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"And Braddock's army was done so brown,"
242,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,Left without a scalp to its crown.
243,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,It was on the terrible earthquake-day
244,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,That the Deacon finished the one-hoss-shay.
245,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
246,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Now in building of chaises, I tell you what,"
247,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"There is always _somewhere_ a weakest spot,--"
248,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,"
249,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,"
250,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
251,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"[Illustration: ""A chaise breaks down but doesn't wear out""]"
252,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
253,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,--lurking still,"
254,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Find it somewhere you must and will,--"
255,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Above or below, or within or without,--"
256,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,"
257,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"A chaise _breaks down_, but doesn't _wear out_."
258,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
259,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,"
260,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"With an ""I dew vum,"" or an ""I tell _yeou_,"")"
261,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,He would build one shay to beat the taown
262,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,'n' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';
263,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,It should be so built that it _couldn'_ break daown!
264,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"--""Fur,"" said the Deacon, ""'t's mighty plain"

269,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
270,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
271,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Where he could find the strongest oak,"
272,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"That couldn't be split nor bent nor broke,--"
273,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
274,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,[Illustration]
275,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,
276,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,That was for spokes and floor and sills;
277,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,He sent for lancewood to make the thills;
278,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees,"
279,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese,"
280,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,But lasts like iron for things like these;
281,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"The hubs of logs from the ""Settler's ellum,""--"
282,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Last of its timber,--they couldn't sell 'em,"
283,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Never an axe had seen their chips,"
284,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,And the wedges flew from between their lip
285,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;
286,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,"
287,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,"
288,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Steel of the finest, bright and blue;"
289,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;"
290,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide"

314,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,Eighteen hundred increased by ten;--
315,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,"""Hahnsum kerridge"" they called it then."
316,THE BROOMSTICK TRAIN.,Eighteen hundred and twenty came;--
