90,PREFACE,
91,PREFACE,This first collected edition of my poems contains all the verses I
92,PREFACE,"care to retain except the translations from the German, published in"
93,PREFACE,"1895 under the title of _The White Snake_, and some of the poems in"
94,PREFACE,"_Nature-Notes and Impressions_, published in 1906."
95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,Several of the poems which I probably would have omitted I have retained
97,PREFACE,"at the solicitation of friends, who have based their argument for their"
98,PREFACE,retention upon the generally admitted fact that a poet seldom knows his
99,PREFACE,best work.
100,PREFACE,
101,PREFACE,The new arrangement under new titles I found was necessary for the sake
102,PREFACE,of convenience; and the poems in a manner grouped themselves in certain
103,PREFACE,classes. In eliminating the old titles--some eighteen in number--I have
104,PREFACE,"disregarded entirely, except in the case of the first volume, the date of"
105,PREFACE,"the appearance of each poem, placing every one, according to its subject"
106,PREFACE,"matter, in its proper group under its corresponding title."
107,PREFACE,
108,PREFACE,"Most of the poems, especially the earlier ones, have been revised; many"
109,PREFACE,"of them almost entirely rewritten and, I think, improved."

119,INTRODUCTION,
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,Since the disappearance of the latest survivors of that graceful and
122,INTRODUCTION,somewhat academic school of poets who ruled American literature so long
123,INTRODUCTION,"from the shores of Massachusetts, serious poetry in the United States"
124,INTRODUCTION,seems to have been passing through a crisis of languor. Perhaps there is
125,INTRODUCTION,"no country on the civilized globe where, in theory, verse is treated with"
126,INTRODUCTION,"more respect and, in practice, with greater lack of grave consideration"
127,INTRODUCTION,than in America. No conjecture as to the reason of this must be attempted
128,INTRODUCTION,"here, further than to suggest that the extreme value set upon sharpness,"
129,INTRODUCTION,ingenuity and rapid mobility is obviously calculated to depreciate and
130,INTRODUCTION,to condemn the quiet practice of the most meditative of the arts. Hence
131,INTRODUCTION,"we find that it is what is called ""humorous"" verse which is mainly in"
132,INTRODUCTION,fashion on the western side of the Atlantic. Those rhymes are most warmly
133,INTRODUCTION,"welcomed which play the most preposterous tricks with language, which"
134,INTRODUCTION,"dazzle by the most mountebank swiftness of turn, and which depend most"
135,INTRODUCTION,for their effect upon paradox and the negation of sober thought. It
136,INTRODUCTION,"is probable that the diseased craving for what is ""smart,"" ""snappy,"""
137,INTRODUCTION,"and wide-awake, and the impulse to see everything foreshortened and"
138,INTRODUCTION,"topsy-turvy, must wear themselves out before cooler and more graceful"
139,INTRODUCTION,tastes again prevail in imaginative literature.
140,INTRODUCTION,
141,INTRODUCTION,"Whatever be the cause, it is certain that this is not a moment when"
142,INTRODUCTION,"serious poetry, of any species, is flourishing in the United States. The"
143,INTRODUCTION,"absence of anything like a common impulse among young writers, of any"
144,INTRODUCTION,"definite and intelligible, if excessive, _parti pris_, is immediately"
145,INTRODUCTION,"observable if we contrast the American, for instance, with the French"
146,INTRODUCTION,poets of the last fifteen years. Where there is no school and no clear
147,INTRODUCTION,"trend of executive ambition, the solitary artist, whose talent forces"
148,INTRODUCTION,"itself up into the light and air, suffers unusual difficulties, and"
149,INTRODUCTION,runs a constant danger of being choked in the aimless mediocrity that
150,INTRODUCTION,surrounds him. We occasionally meet with a poet in the history of
151,INTRODUCTION,"literature, of whom we are inclined to say: ""Charming as he is, he would"
152,INTRODUCTION,"have developed his talent more evenly and conspicuously, if he had been"
153,INTRODUCTION,"accompanied from the first by other young men like-minded, who would"
154,INTRODUCTION,"have formed for him an atmosphere and cleared for him a space."" This is"
155,INTRODUCTION,"the one regret I feel in contemplating, as I have done for years past,"
156,INTRODUCTION,the ardent and beautiful talent of Mr. Madison Cawein. I deplore the
157,INTRODUCTION,fact that he seems to stand alone in his generation; I think his poetry
158,INTRODUCTION,"would have been even better than it is, and its qualities would certainly"
159,INTRODUCTION,"have been more clearly perceived, and more intelligently appreciated, if"
160,INTRODUCTION,"he were less isolated. In his own country, at this particular moment,"
161,INTRODUCTION,"in this matter of serious nature-painting in lyric verse, Mr. Cawein"
162,INTRODUCTION,"possesses what Cowley would have called ""a monopoly of wit."" In one of"
163,INTRODUCTION,his lyrics Mr. Cawein asks--
164,INTRODUCTION,
165,INTRODUCTION,"""The song-birds, are they flown away,"
166,INTRODUCTION,"The song-birds of the summer-time,"
167,INTRODUCTION,"That sang their souls into the day,"
168,INTRODUCTION,And set the laughing hours to rhyme?
169,INTRODUCTION,No cat-bird scatters through the hush
170,INTRODUCTION,The sparkling crystals of her song;
171,INTRODUCTION,Within the woods no hermit-thrush
172,INTRODUCTION,"Trails an enchanted flute along."""
173,INTRODUCTION,
174,INTRODUCTION,"To this inquiry, the answer is: the only hermit-thrush now audible seems"
175,INTRODUCTION,"to sing from Louisville, Kentucky. America will, we may be perfectly"
176,INTRODUCTION,"sure, calm herself into harmony again, and possess once more her school"
177,INTRODUCTION,"of singers. In those coming days, history may perceive in Mr. Cawein the"
178,INTRODUCTION,golden link that bound the music of the past to the music of the future
179,INTRODUCTION,through an interval of comparative tunelessness.
180,INTRODUCTION,
181,INTRODUCTION,The career of Mr. Madison Cawein is represented to me as being most
182,INTRODUCTION,uneventful. He seems to have enjoyed unusual advantages for the
183,INTRODUCTION,cultivation and protection of the poetical temperament. He was born on
184,INTRODUCTION,"the 23rd of March, 1865, in the metropolis of Kentucky, the vigorous"
185,INTRODUCTION,"city of Louisville, on the southern side of the Ohio, in the midst of"
186,INTRODUCTION,a country celebrated for tobacco and whisky and Indian corn. These are
187,INTRODUCTION,"commodities which may be consumed in excess, but in moderation they"
188,INTRODUCTION,"make glad the heart of man. They represent a certain glow of the earth,"
189,INTRODUCTION,they indicate the action of a serene and gentle climate upon a rich
190,INTRODUCTION,soil. It was in this delicate and voluptuous state of Kentucky that Mr.
191,INTRODUCTION,"Cawein was born, that he was educated, that he became a poet, and that"
192,INTRODUCTION,he has lived ever since. His blood is full of the color and odor of his
193,INTRODUCTION,native landscape. The solemn books of history tell us that Kentucky was
194,INTRODUCTION,"discovered in 1769, by Daniel Boone, a hunter. But he first discovers a"
195,INTRODUCTION,"country who sees it first, and teaches the world to see it; no doubt some"
196,INTRODUCTION,"day the city of Louisville will erect, in one of its principal squares,"
197,INTRODUCTION,"a statue to ""Madison Cawein, who discovered the Beauty of Kentucky."" The"
198,INTRODUCTION,"genius of this poet is like one of those deep rivers of his native state,"
199,INTRODUCTION,which cut paths through the forests of chestnut and hemlock as they hurry
200,INTRODUCTION,"towards the south and west, brushing with the impulsive fringe of their"
201,INTRODUCTION,currents the rhododendrons and calmias and azaleas that bend from the
202,INTRODUCTION,banks to be mirrored in their flashing waters.
203,INTRODUCTION,
204,INTRODUCTION,Mr. Cawein's vocation to poetry was irresistible. I do not know that
205,INTRODUCTION,he even tried to resist it. I have even the idea that a little more
206,INTRODUCTION,resistance would have been salutary for a talent which nothing could
207,INTRODUCTION,"have discouraged, and which opposition might have taught the arts of"
208,INTRODUCTION,"compression and selection. Mr. Cawein suffered at first, I think, from"
209,INTRODUCTION,lack of criticism more than from lack of eulogy. From his early writings
210,INTRODUCTION,I seem to gather an impression of a Louisville more ready to praise
211,INTRODUCTION,"what was second-rate than what was first-rate, and practically, indeed,"
212,INTRODUCTION,without any scale of appreciation whatever. This may be a mistake of
213,INTRODUCTION,"mine; at all events, Mr. Cawein has had more to gain from the passage"
214,INTRODUCTION,of years in self-criticism than in inspiring enthusiasm. The fount
215,INTRODUCTION,was in him from the first; but it bubbled forth before he had digged a
216,INTRODUCTION,"definite channel for it. Sometimes, to this very day, he sports with"
217,INTRODUCTION,"the principles of syntax, as Nature played games so long ago with"
218,INTRODUCTION,the fantastic caverns of the valley of the Green River or with the
219,INTRODUCTION,"coral-reefs of his own Ohio. He has bad rhymes, amazing in so delicate"
220,INTRODUCTION,an ear; he has awkwardness of phrase not expected in one so plunged in
221,INTRODUCTION,contemplation of the eternal harmony of Nature. But these grow fewer and
222,INTRODUCTION,less obtrusive as the years pass by.
223,INTRODUCTION,
224,INTRODUCTION,"The virgin timber-forests of Kentucky, the woods of honey-locust and"
225,INTRODUCTION,"buckeye, of white oak and yellow poplar, with their clearings full of"
226,INTRODUCTION,"flowers unknown to us by sight or name, from which in the distance are"
227,INTRODUCTION,"visible the domes of the far-away Cumberland Mountains,--this seems to"
228,INTRODUCTION,"be the hunting-field of Mr. Cawein's imagination. Here all, it must be"
229,INTRODUCTION,"confessed, has hitherto been unfamiliar to the Muses. If Persephone"
230,INTRODUCTION,"""of our Cumnor cowslips never heard,"" how much less can her attention"
231,INTRODUCTION,"have been arrested by clusters of orchids from the Ocklawaha, or by the"
232,INTRODUCTION,"song of the whippoorwill, rung out when ""the west was hot geranium-red"""
233,INTRODUCTION,"under the boughs of a black-jack on the slopes of Mount Kinnex. ""Not"
234,INTRODUCTION,"here,"" one is inclined to exclaim, ""not here, O Apollo, are haunts meet"
235,INTRODUCTION,"for thee,"" but the art of the poet is displayed by his skill in breaking"
236,INTRODUCTION,down these prejudices of time and place. Mr. Cawein reconciles us to
237,INTRODUCTION,his strange landscape--the strangeness of which one has to admit is
238,INTRODUCTION,"mainly one of nomenclature,--by the exercise of a delightful instinctive"
239,INTRODUCTION,"pantheism. He brings the ancient gods to Kentucky, and it is marvelous"
240,INTRODUCTION,"how quickly they learn to be at home there. Here is Bacchus, with a spicy"
241,INTRODUCTION,"fragment of calamus-root in his hand, trampling the blue-eyed grass, and"
242,INTRODUCTION,"skipping, with the air of a hunter born, into the hickory thicket, to"
243,INTRODUCTION,"escape Artemis, whose robes, as she passes swiftly with her dogs through"
244,INTRODUCTION,"the woods, startle the humming-birds, silence the green tree-frogs, and"
245,INTRODUCTION,fill the hot still air with the perfumes of peppermint and pennyroyal.
246,INTRODUCTION,"It is a queer landscape, but one of new natural beauties frankly and"
247,INTRODUCTION,"sympathetically discovered, and it forms a _mise en scene_ which, I make"
248,INTRODUCTION,"bold to say, would have scandalized neither Keats nor Spenser."
249,INTRODUCTION,
250,INTRODUCTION,"It was Mr. Howells,--ever as generous in discovering new talent as he is"
251,INTRODUCTION,"unflinching in reproof of the effeteness of European taste,--who first"
252,INTRODUCTION,drew attention to the originality and beauty of Mr. Cawein's poetry. The
253,INTRODUCTION,"Kentucky poet had, at that time, published but one tentative volume,"
254,INTRODUCTION,"the _Blooms of the Berry_, of 1887. This was followed, in 1888, by _The"
255,INTRODUCTION,"Triumph of Music_, and since then hardly a year has passed without a"
256,INTRODUCTION,slender sheaf of verse from Mr. Cawein's garden. Among these (if a single
257,INTRODUCTION,"volume is to be indicated), the quality which distinguishes him from all"
258,INTRODUCTION,"other poets,--the Kentucky flavor, if we may call it so,--is perhaps to"
259,INTRODUCTION,be most agreeably detected in _Intimations of the Beautiful_.
260,INTRODUCTION,
261,INTRODUCTION,But it is time that I should leave the American lyrist to make his own
262,INTRODUCTION,"appeal, with but one additional word of explanation, namely, that in"
263,INTRODUCTION,"this introduction Mr. Cawein's narrative poems on medieval themes, and"
264,INTRODUCTION,"in general his cosmopolitan writings, have been neglected of mention in"
265,INTRODUCTION,favor of such nature lyrics as would present him most vividly in his own
266,INTRODUCTION,"native landscape, no visitor in spirit to Europe, but at home in that"
267,INTRODUCTION,bright and exuberant West--
268,INTRODUCTION,
269,INTRODUCTION,"""Where, in the hazy morning, runs"
270,INTRODUCTION,"The stony branch that pools and drips,"
271,INTRODUCTION,Where red haws and the wild-rose hips
272,INTRODUCTION,Are strewn like pebbles; where the sun's
273,INTRODUCTION,Own gold seems captured by the weeds;
274,INTRODUCTION,"To see, through scintillating seeds,"
275,INTRODUCTION,The hunters steal with glimmering guns.
276,INTRODUCTION,To stand within the dewy ring
277,INTRODUCTION,"Where pale death smites the boneset's blooms,"
278,INTRODUCTION,"And everlasting's flowers, and plumes"
279,INTRODUCTION,"Of mint, with aromatic wing!"
280,INTRODUCTION,"And hear the creek,--whose sobbing seems"
281,INTRODUCTION,"A wild man murmuring in his dreams,--"
282,INTRODUCTION,"And insect violins that sing!"""
283,INTRODUCTION,
284,INTRODUCTION,"So sweet a voice, so consonant with the music of the singers of past"
285,INTRODUCTION,"times, heard in a place so fresh and strange, will surely not pass"
286,INTRODUCTION,without its welcome from lovers of genuine poetry.

2367,I,
2368,I,"Oh, cool as the flutter of fountains,"
2369,I,"And fresh as the fall of the dew,"
2370,I,"Wet as the hues of the rain-arch,"
2371,I,"In that vale, is the dawn, when, o'er mountains,"
2372,I,"Pearl-peaked and hyaline blue,"
2373,I,"Through the Memnonian blue,"
2374,I,"Her spirit, like music, comes slowly,"
2375,I,"A music of light and of fire,"
2376,I,Leaving her footsteps in roses
2377,I,"There on its summits, while holy,"
2378,I,"Fair on her brow is her tire,"
2379,I,Gemmed with the morning-star's fire.
2380,I,
2381,I,
2382,II,II
2383,II,
2384,II,"And still as the incense of altars,"
2385,II,"And dim as the deeps of a cloud,"
2386,II,"Mystic as winds of the woodlands,"
2387,II,"In that vale, is the night when she falters"
2388,II,"In the sorrowful folds of her shroud,"
2389,II,"The far-blowing dusk of her shroud,"
2390,II,"By the scarlet-strewn bier of her lover,"
2391,II,"The day, lying faded and fair"
2392,II,In his chamber of purple and vair.--
2393,II,"When, above it, you see her uncover"
2394,II,Her star-girdled darkness of hair--
2395,II,Gold-hooped with the gold of the even--
2396,II,"And for the day's burial prepare,"
2397,II,"The spirit of night in the heaven,"
2398,II,"O'er that vale, is most hauntingly fair;"
2399,II,So fair that you wish it were given
2400,II,"That you in the rays of her hair,"
2401,II,Might die! in her gold-girdled hair.
2402,II,
2403,II,
2404,III,III
2405,III,
2406,III,"There lies in a valley, where mountains"
2407,III,"Have walled it from all that is ours,"
2408,III,A garden entangled with flowers;
2409,III,Where the whisper of echoing fountains
2410,III,Makes song in the balm-breathing bowers:
2411,III,"Where torrents, plunged down from wild masses"
2412,III,"Of granite, from cavern-pierced steeps,"
2413,III,"With thunders sonorous cleave passes,"
2414,III,"And madden the world with their leaps,"
2415,III,The clamorous foam of their leaps.
2416,III,
2417,III,
2418,IV,IV
2419,IV,
2420,IV,"And, oh! when the sunlight comes heaping"
2421,IV,"With glitter the mist of those chasms,"
2422,IV,"The foam of those musical chasms,"
2423,IV,"You may hear a lamenting and weeping,"
2424,IV,"And see in the vastness far sweeping,"
2425,IV,"In wild and æolian spasms,"
2426,IV,"Down, down in those voluble chasms,"
2427,IV,The Spirits of Light and of Darkness.
2428,IV,And the wave from the gray-hearted granite
2429,IV,In rivers rolls rippling around;
2430,IV,"Meanders through shade-haunted forests,"
2431,IV,"Where many rock-barriers can span it,"
2432,IV,And dash it in froth and in sound;
2433,IV,"Where the nights with their great moons can wan it,"
2434,IV,Or star its dark stillness profound.
2435,IV,
2436,IV,
2437,V,V
2438,V,
2439,V,"And here with her harp doth she wander,"
2440,V,"That daughter of music, twice kissed"
2441,V,Of the Spirits of Love and of Sorrow:
2442,V,"Yea, here doth she wander and ponder,"
2443,V,"That maiden of moonlight and mist,"
2444,V,With starlight on hair and on wrist;
2445,V,"Yea, here doth she ponder and wander"
2446,V,"'Mid blossoms with loveliness whist,"
2447,V,'Mid moonlight with fragrances kissed.
2448,V,And ever her being grows fonder
2449,V,"Of forests where phantoms keep tryst,"
2450,V,The people of moon and of mist:
2451,V,"And often they troop to her singing,"
2452,V,As she sits 'mid the undulant cedars--
2453,V,All savage of wildness and scent--
2454,V,"Whose tops to her beauty are bent,"
2455,V,"Like the pennons and plumes of fierce leaders,"
2456,V,In worship and testament:
2457,V,"Like the pennons and plumes of fierce leaders,"
2458,V,All ragged with battle and rent.
2459,V,
2460,V,
2461,VI,VI
2462,VI,
2463,VI,"And oft when the moon, like a palace"
2464,VI,"Of witchcraft, shines white overhead,"
2465,VI,"Making pearl of the foam of the torrent,"
2466,VI,She wakes her wild harp in the valleys
2467,VI,Where the blossoms have built her a bed:
2468,VI,She sits where a fountain of flowers
2469,VI,"Rains fragrance from branches around,"
2470,VI,"The blossomed lianas around,"
2471,VI,Keeping time with their petal-sweet showers
2472,VI,To her harp; with its strain interwound;
2473,VI,"Unfolding, it seems, to the sound:"
2474,VI,"While her song is as redolence round her,"
2475,VI,"And their fragrance as music, it seems,"
2476,VI,Whose touch and enchantment have bound her
2477,VI,"With shadows and whispers of dreams,"
2478,VI,"And she seems but a part of her dreams,"
2479,VI,A creature created of dreams.
2480,VI,
2481,VI,
2482,VII,VII
2483,VII,
2484,VII,One night as she whispered and wandered
2485,VII,"In her garden of music and flowers,"
2486,VII,"She saw, in a ray of the moonlight,"
2487,VII,A youth fast asleep 'mid the flowers;
2488,VII,"A youth on a mantle of satin,"
2489,VII,A poppy-red robe 'mid the flowers.
2490,VII,
2491,VII,
2492,VIII,VIII
2493,VIII,
2494,VIII,"Love housed 'neath his eyelids, that, slender"
2495,VIII,"As petals of roses, were pale:"
2496,VIII,"She bent and she kissed them and, tender,"
2497,VIII,"She murmured and bade them unveil,"
2498,VIII,The blossoms beneath them unveil.
2499,VIII,And he woke and beheld her and panted:--
2500,VIII,"""At last I behold thee, O Song!"
2501,VIII,"O beautiful, pitiless Song!"
2502,VIII,"Thou, thou, who so wildly enchanted,"
2503,VIII,"And led me, eluded me long!"
2504,VIII,"Evaded and lured me so long!"""
2505,VIII,
2506,VIII,
2507,IX,IX
2508,IX,
2509,IX,"Then she knelt on the mantle of satin,"
2510,IX,And plunged a long look in his eyes:
2511,IX,"She knelt on the mantle of scarlet,"
2512,IX,"And kissed him on mouth and on eyes,"
2513,IX,And mingled her soul with his sighs.
2514,IX,"And then in a moment she knew it,--"
2515,IX,He deemed her a part of his dream;
2516,IX,"And she smiled and she said, ""I am Music!"
2517,IX,"And thy soul--'twas my spirit that drew it,"
2518,IX,"Thy soul, with a mystical gleam,"
2519,IX,"A brightness, a glimmer, a gleam."""
2520,IX,
2521,IX,
2522,X,X
2523,X,
2524,X,"And he gazed at her strangely; and, sobbing,"
2525,X,"Cried out, ""Yea; thy harp!--is it strung?"
2526,X,"Thy harp of wild gold, is it strung?"
2527,X,With fingers of silver set throbbing
2528,X,"Its chords with that song thou hast sung,"
2529,X,"So oft in my dreams thou hast sung."""
2530,X,
2531,X,
2532,XI,XI
2533,XI,
2534,XI,Then he ceased:--and his eyes--how they glistened!
2535,XI,"His eyes, that were haunted with pain,"
2536,XI,With longing and beauty and pain:
2537,XI,"And again he cried out, ""Oh, that music!"
2538,XI,That proud and that perilous music!
2539,XI,"O God! for that tyrannous strain,"
2540,XI,"To which in my dreams I have listened,"
2541,XI,"Ah, God! I have listened in vain!"""
2542,XI,And he tossed on the mantle of satin
2543,XI,His deep raven darkness of hair;
2544,XI,"And the song at her lips was ungathered,"
2545,XI,And she sat there to marvel and stare;
2546,XI,"Like marble, to wonder and stare."
2547,XI,
2548,XI,
2549,XII,XII
2550,XII,
2551,XII,Then there welled from her lips all the glory
2552,XII,Of music delirious with words;
2553,XII,"Of music that told the heart's story,"
2554,XII,"And trembled with God-given words,"
2555,XII,And rang like the crossing of swords.
2556,XII,And it seemed that the spirit of Beauty
2557,XII,Swept through it with farewells and sighs;
2558,XII,"The spirits of Beauty and Duty,"
2559,XII,And Love with his beautiful eyes;
2560,XII,"And Heaven, and Hell with its cries;"
2561,XII,Sad Hell with a tempest of cries.
2562,XII,
2563,XII,
2564,XIII,XIII
2565,XIII,
2566,XIII,The rapture was there of all passion;
2567,XIII,The heartache of all we have lost:
2568,XIII,The sweetness was there that we fashion
2569,XIII,"From love we have won or have lost,"
2570,XIII,"Its terror, its torment, and cost."
2571,XIII,And over it all was a fury
2572,XIII,"Of wings that seemed beating above,"
2573,XIII,Of stars and of winds and the glory
2574,XIII,"Of God and the splendor of love,"
2575,XIII,The splendor and triumph of love.
2576,XIII,
2577,XIII,
2578,XIV,XIV
2579,XIV,
2580,XIV,"And then, from her poppy wings, Slumber"
2581,XIV,Dropped petals of sleep on his eyes;
2582,XIV,The Spirit of Slumber with pinions
2583,XIV,"Of vaporous silver, whose flutter"
2584,XIV,"Had mixed with the music's wild number,"
2585,XIV,Lured down from the shadowy skies;
2586,XIV,"Lured down from her drowsy dominions,"
2587,XIV,To nest in his tired-out eyes.
2588,XIV,
2589,XIV,
2590,XV,XV
2591,XV,
2592,XV,"And in sleep he cried out to her,--stilling"
2593,XV,"A moment the rush of her song,"
2594,XV,"The rainbowing torrent of song,--"
2595,XV,"""Cease! cease! for the rapture is killing!"
2596,XV,The glory of light is too strong!--
2597,XV,"Oh, cease! make an end of thy song!""--"
2598,XV,"But she, with the frenzy o'erflowing,"
2599,XV,"Cried out in an anguish of passion,"
2600,XV,"""Thy soul shall be one with my song,"
2601,XV,With me and the soul of my song.
2602,XV,Take my hand! let us walk in the glowing
2603,XV,Sweet heaven and hell of all song;
2604,XV,"Where the torrents of music are flowing,"
2605,XV,The rivers of music and song.
2606,XV,Take my hand! Dost thou hear? We are going!
2607,XV,"We, too, to God's splendor belong!"
2608,XV,"Let us walk in the light of His song,"
2609,XV,"The thunder and flame of His song."""
2610,XV,
2611,XV,
2612,XVI,XVI
2613,XVI,
2614,XVI,"Then she flung in her song the emotion,"
2615,XVI,"Triumphant, of heart and of soul;"
2616,XVI,Till the passion and pain were an ocean
2617,XVI,"That swept her with billowing roll,"
2618,XVI,"As it seemed, to abysses of dole,"
2619,XVI,Abysses of infinite dole.
2620,XVI,
2621,XVI,
2622,XVII,XVII
2623,XVII,
2624,XVII,And paler than moonlight and marble
2625,XVII,"He lay on the red of that robe,"
2626,XVII,"Lay white at her feet on the scarlet,"
2627,XVII,With silence-sealed lips and the glitter
2628,XVII,Of tears in each violet globe
2629,XVII,"Of his eyes.--And she said: ""It is bitter"
2630,XVII,"To see him so still on this robe,"
2631,XVII,"Like marble so still on this robe."""
2632,XVII,"Then she knelt and cried out, ""Art thou living?"
2633,XVII,Or dead?--Have I slain thee with song?--
2634,XVII,"I gave thee the best in my giving,"
2635,XVII,But all that I gave thee seems wrong!--
2636,XVII,"No blessing, a curse was my song!"
2637,XVII,"A curse and a sorrow my song!"""
2638,XVII,
2639,XVII,
2640,XVIII,XVIII
2641,XVIII,
2642,XVIII,"And she shattered her harp in her madness,"
2643,XVIII,And rent at her breasts and her hair;
2644,XVIII,"Then kissed him on mouth and on temples,"
2645,XVIII,"And spoke to him smoothing the sadness,"
2646,XVIII,"The calm of his brow that was fair,"
2647,XVIII,Was perfect and hopelessly fair.
2648,XVIII,"Then she wailed to the stars in the heaven,"
2649,XVIII,"And railed at her song as a thief,"
2650,XVIII,"Calling out, ""For a curse wast thou given!"
2651,XVIII,"Yea, thou! for a curse and a grief!"
2652,XVIII,"A curse and an infinite grief!"""
2653,XVIII,
2654,XVIII,
2655,XIX,XIX
2656,XIX,
2657,XIX,"And the moon, it went down like a broken"
2658,XIX,Great dagger of gold in the west;
2659,XIX,"Like a dagger of gold that was broken,"
2660,XIX,"Her dagger of song, that had spoken,"
2661,XIX,"And pierced with its beauty his breast,"
2662,XIX,Had ravished his soul from his breast.
2663,XIX,"And she lay with her hair, deep and golden,"
2664,XIX,Thick showered and shaken on his;
2665,XIX,Her arms around him were enfolden;
2666,XIX,"Her lips clave to his with a kiss,"
2667,XIX,The love and the grief of a kiss.

2675,BLODEUWEDD,"Not to that demon's son, whom Arthur erst,"
2676,BLODEUWEDD,"For necromancy, at Caerleon, first"
2677,BLODEUWEDD,"Graced greatly, Merlin,--not to him alone"
2678,BLODEUWEDD,"Did those lost learnings of white magic, known"
2679,BLODEUWEDD,"As sorcery and witchcraft, then belong."
2680,BLODEUWEDD,"Taliesin, now, hath told us in a song"
2681,BLODEUWEDD,"Of one at Arvon, Math of Gwynedd; lord"
2682,BLODEUWEDD,Of some vague cantrevs of the North; whose sword
2683,BLODEUWEDD,"Beat back and slew a southern king, through wrath"
2684,BLODEUWEDD,"And puissance of Gwydion, whose path"
2685,BLODEUWEDD,"Thence on, with love, he honored."
2686,BLODEUWEDD,
2687,BLODEUWEDD,Now this Math
2688,BLODEUWEDD,"Was learned in wondrous witchcraft: as he willed,"
2689,BLODEUWEDD,"He wrought the invisible visible, and filled"
2690,BLODEUWEDD,"The sight with seeming shapes, which it believed"
2691,BLODEUWEDD,"Realities, nor knew it was deceived."
2692,BLODEUWEDD,"For, at his word, the winds were wan with tents,"
2693,BLODEUWEDD,And armies rose of airy elements;
2694,BLODEUWEDD,"And brassy blasts of war from bugles brayed,"
2695,BLODEUWEDD,"And armored hosts in battle clanged and swayed,"
2696,BLODEUWEDD,"And at a word were not. And at his nod,"
2697,BLODEUWEDD,"Steeds, rich-accoutered, whinnying softly, trod"
2698,BLODEUWEDD,"The dædal earth; and hounds, of greater worth,"
2699,BLODEUWEDD,"And wirier, too, than dogs of mortal birth,"
2700,BLODEUWEDD,"Rose up, like forest fungus, from the earth"
2701,BLODEUWEDD,"Around th' astonished stag, or flying doe,"
2702,BLODEUWEDD,Let Math but wish it or his trumpet blow.
2703,BLODEUWEDD,But only things that had their counterpart
2704,BLODEUWEDD,On earth could he make real through his art.
2705,BLODEUWEDD,
2706,BLODEUWEDD,"Now, to his castle, Math, through Gwydion,--"
2707,BLODEUWEDD,"The son of Don,--the daughter dark of Don,"
2708,BLODEUWEDD,"The silver-circled Arianrod, had brought;"
2709,BLODEUWEDD,"A southern rose of beauty, whom Math thought"
2710,BLODEUWEDD,"To wed, in love and friendship, without blame,"
2711,BLODEUWEDD,And at Caer Dathyl. When the maiden came
2712,BLODEUWEDD,"Said Math, ""Art thou a virgin?""--Like a flame"
2713,BLODEUWEDD,"Mantling, her answer angered, ""Verily,"
2714,BLODEUWEDD,"I know not other, lord, than that I be!""--"
2715,BLODEUWEDD,So wrought he then through magic that the form
2716,BLODEUWEDD,"Of her boy baby seemed upon her arm,"
2717,BLODEUWEDD,White as a rose.
2718,BLODEUWEDD,"""A Mary!--Yea!"" laughed Math;"
2719,BLODEUWEDD,"""Forsooth, another Mary!"" then in wrath"
2720,BLODEUWEDD,Laid harsh hands on the babe and fiercely flung
2721,BLODEUWEDD,Far in the salt sea. But the strong winds clung
2722,BLODEUWEDD,Fast to the Elfin and the lithe waves swept
2723,BLODEUWEDD,Him safely shoreward dry; some fishers kept
2724,BLODEUWEDD,"Him thus unseaed and christened Dylan, fair"
2725,BLODEUWEDD,"Son of the wave, and fostered him with care."
2726,BLODEUWEDD,"Nor was this really hers. But Gwydion,"
2727,BLODEUWEDD,"Brother to Arianrod, before the sun"
2728,BLODEUWEDD,"Had time to glimpse it with one golden glaive,"
2729,BLODEUWEDD,"Swiftly,--as hoping the real babe to save,--"
2730,BLODEUWEDD,Some dim small body on the castle pave
2731,BLODEUWEDD,"In raven velvet seized; and, hiding, he"
2732,BLODEUWEDD,"Stole this from court, to subtly raise to be"
2733,BLODEUWEDD,"A comely youth. In time, to Arianrod"
2734,BLODEUWEDD,"Came, swearing by the rood and blood of God"
2735,BLODEUWEDD,He brought her back her son.
2736,BLODEUWEDD,
2737,BLODEUWEDD,"Quoth she: ""More shame"
2738,BLODEUWEDD,"Dost thou disgrace thyself with, and more blame"
2739,BLODEUWEDD,"Dost damn thyself with, thus to mix our name"
2740,BLODEUWEDD,"With this dishonor, brother, than myself!"""
2741,BLODEUWEDD,"Then, waxing wroth, cried Gwydion, ""The Elf"
2742,BLODEUWEDD,"Is thine then?--Tell me, wanton! is thy son"
2743,BLODEUWEDD,"Dylan, the fisher, or this fair-haired one,"
2744,BLODEUWEDD,"This youth?--God's curse!""--and daggered her with looks."
2745,BLODEUWEDD,"And she in turn waxed fiery, saying, ""Books"
2746,BLODEUWEDD,Of magic I have read as well as Math!
2747,BLODEUWEDD,"And now I tell thee, keep from out my path!"
2748,BLODEUWEDD,"Thou and thy bastard, he as well as thou!"
2749,BLODEUWEDD,"Thou dog! And on thy folly, listen, now"
2750,BLODEUWEDD,I lay a threefold curse: behold! the first--
2751,BLODEUWEDD,"Until I name him, nameless be he! Cursed"
2752,BLODEUWEDD,Be they who give him arms!--the second:--nor
2753,BLODEUWEDD,Shall he bear arms until I arm for war.
2754,BLODEUWEDD,"And, lastly, know, however high his birth,"
2755,BLODEUWEDD,He shall not wed a woman of the Earth!--
2756,BLODEUWEDD,"Malignity! to shame me with thy sin!"""
2757,BLODEUWEDD,Then passed into her tower and locked her in.
2758,BLODEUWEDD,
2759,BLODEUWEDD,"But Gwydion, departing with the youth,"
2760,BLODEUWEDD,"Sware he would compass her; if not through truth,"
2761,BLODEUWEDD,Through wiles and learnéd magic. And he wrought
2762,BLODEUWEDD,So that unbending Arianrod was brought
2763,BLODEUWEDD,"To name the lad. Again he managed that,"
2764,BLODEUWEDD,"Though strange enchantments as of war, he gat"
2765,BLODEUWEDD,"Her to give arms. But then, not for his life,"
2766,BLODEUWEDD,"Howbeit, could he get the youth a wife."
2767,BLODEUWEDD,"Persisting, desperate, at last the thing"
2768,BLODEUWEDD,Wrought in him blusterous as a backward spring.
2769,BLODEUWEDD,Now Llew the youth was named. And Gwydion
2770,BLODEUWEDD,"Made his complaint to Math, the mighty son"
2771,BLODEUWEDD,Of Mathonwy.
2772,BLODEUWEDD,
2773,BLODEUWEDD,"Said Math: ""Despair not. We"
2774,BLODEUWEDD,"With charms, illusions, and white sorcery"
2775,BLODEUWEDD,Will seek to make--for mine are wondrous powers--
2776,BLODEUWEDD,"A woman for him out of forest flowers."""
2777,BLODEUWEDD,
2778,BLODEUWEDD,"And so they toiled together one wan night,"
2779,BLODEUWEDD,"When the full moon hung low, and watched, a white"
2780,BLODEUWEDD,Wild wisp-like face behind a mist. They took
2781,BLODEUWEDD,"Blossoms of briars, blooming by a brook"
2782,BLODEUWEDD,Shed from the April hills; and phantom blooms
2783,BLODEUWEDD,Of yellow broom that filtered faint perfumes;
2784,BLODEUWEDD,"And primrose blossoms, frail, of rainy smell,"
2785,BLODEUWEDD,"Weak pink, dim-clustered in a glow-worm dell;"
2786,BLODEUWEDD,"Wild-apple sprigs, that tipsied bells of blaze,"
2787,BLODEUWEDD,"And in far, haunted hollows made a haze"
2788,BLODEUWEDD,"Of ghostly, fugitive fragrance; and the blue"
2789,BLODEUWEDD,"Of hollow harebells, hoary with the dew;"
2790,BLODEUWEDD,"The gold of kingcups, golden as low stars;"
2791,BLODEUWEDD,"And white of lilies,--rolled in limpid bars,"
2792,BLODEUWEDD,"Like sleepy foam,--that swayed aslant and spilled"
2793,BLODEUWEDD,Slim nectar-cups of musk the rain had filled;
2794,BLODEUWEDD,"And paly, wildwood wind-flowers; and the gloss"
2795,BLODEUWEDD,And glow of celandine; and bulbs that boss

2813,BLODEUWEDD,"Were in her body, that was not like ours"
2814,BLODEUWEDD,And yet was like: but in her brow and face

3008,URGANDA,"The leaded lattice glowed, a square"

3012,URGANDA,"Sir Elid in the moonlight's beam,"

3640,I,"Now there was wind that night, wild wind, and rain;"
3641,I,"And frantic thorns, that huddled on the wold,"
3642,I,Seemed withered witches met in storm again
3643,I,"To keep their Sabbath and to curse and scold,"
3644,I,"With gnarled, fantastic gestures, lame and old."
3645,I,"Deep in a hollow, where some cabin lay,"
3646,I,"A lamplit window, like an eye of gold,"

3652,II,
3653,II,Still I held onward through the ugly night;
3654,II,"Breast-deep in thistles, all their ghostly heads"
3655,II,Kinked close with wet; through the bedraggled plight
3656,II,"Of brakes of bramble, tousled into shreds,"
3657,II,And tangled wastes of briars--tumbling beds
3658,II,"For winds to toss on.--Once, across a farm,"
3659,II,"Unsteadily, a lamp towards unseen sheds,--"
3660,II,"Like the blurred glow of some ungainly worm,--"
3661,II,A watery wisp of light crawled trailing through the storm.

3663,II,
3664,III,III
3665,III,
3666,III,Then swallowing blackness of the night; and thin
3667,III,The shrewd rain beat me and the rough limbs whipped
3668,III,"Of dwarfed, uneasy beeches. There within"
3669,III,Their savage circle battered tombstones tipped
3670,III,Squat lengths to weeds the fighting winds had ripped
3671,III,"And chopped to tatters. And I heard before,"
3672,III,"Rounding a headland, where the gaunt trees dripped,--"
3673,III,"A shout borne deathward from night's ghastly shore,--"
3674,III,Hoarse as a thousand throats the river's sullen roar.

3680,IV,"With clay, damp-dragging, safer were the graves,"
3681,IV,"Crowding that vista of the wood,--which raked"
3682,IV,"My face with burrs,--than, walking towards the waves,"
3683,IV,To feel earth slip away; the architraves
3684,IV,Of darkness plunge me downward to some pit
3685,IV,Of wallow and of water.--Madder knaves
3686,IV,Than I have stood thus in a fever-fit
3687,IV,Of heart and brain and shuddered from the brink of it.
3688,IV,
3689,IV,
3690,V,V
3691,V,
3692,V,Wooingly silence whispered to me there
3693,V,Through boughs of dripping darkness sad with rain;
3694,V,"Darkness, that met my eyeballs everywhere,"
3695,V,Blind-packed and vacant as a madman's brain.
3696,V,"And so I stood and heard the dead leaves drain,"
3697,V,And through the leaves the haunted wind that hissed;
3698,V,Then suddenly--perhaps it was the strain
3699,V,"Snapped in my temples--laughter seemed to twist,"
3700,V,"With evil, night's dead mouth that bent to mine and kissed."

3702,V,
3703,VI,VI
3704,VI,
3705,VI,"Insanity! two leaves that dabbled down,"
3706,VI,"Touched me with drizzle; and that laugh--ah, well,"
3707,VI,No laugh! an owlet hooting at the frown
3708,VI,Night's hag-face tortures while she works her spell.
3709,VI,"Yet I had sworn, before those kisses fell"
3710,VI,"Like winter on me, black as broken jet,"
3711,VI,"An occult blackness like the Prince of Hell,"
3712,VI,"A woman's hand had brushed my face--and yet,"
3713,VI,A bat it might have been made mad with wind and wet.

3717,VII,
3718,VII,"And stark I stood among the sodden stones,"
3719,VII,"Icy with fever, hearing in each gale"
3720,VII,"Strange footsteps,--while within my soul were moans"
3721,VII,"For strength,--as powerless as I was pale."
3722,VII,Then I remembered that within a tale
3723,VII,Once I had read--a chronicle of ills
3724,VII,Cowled monks had written--how one shall not fail
3725,VII,"To find, unsought, the Fiend, if so he wills,"
3726,VII,"Cloak, cap, and cock's crook'd plume among the lonely hills."

3733,VIII,"""Though moonless midnight curse the barren land"
3734,VIII,Sathanas' shadow follows him as red
3735,VIII,"As Hell's red cauldron is.""--My terror fled,"
3736,VIII,Remembering this.--How sad a fool was I
3737,VIII,To dream Hell's wickedness would bow his head
3738,VIII,"By mine, and parley with me, lie for lie,"
3739,VIII,With cunning scrutiny of oblong eye by eye!

3741,VIII,
3742,IX,IX
3743,IX,
3744,IX,"Then, then I felt--_her_ presence! all awake"
3745,IX,Unto her power that could lift or sink;
3746,IX,"And her straight eyes controlling, like an ache,"
3747,IX,"My brain that had no mastery to think,"
3748,IX,"Or to perform. And slowly, link on link,"
3749,IX,"She bound me helpless, like an inquisitor,"
3750,IX,In vasty dungeons of the soul; no wink
3751,IX,"Of light was there, but darkness, bar on bar,"
3752,IX,Self-convoluted chaos strangling will's high star.

3760,X,Yet bless and ban me in a single breath:
3761,X,Who knoweth me a coward is unneth:

3770,XI,Thus did she speak. Her voice was like a flame
3771,XI,
3772,XI,Of burning blackness. Then I felt the throb
3773,XI,Of her still hand in mine. And so I came
3774,XI,"Gladly unto her. Yea, I, too, would rob"
3775,XI,Time of his triumphs.--Who would groan and sob
3776,XI,"Beneath his fardels, hearing sad men sigh"
3777,XI,"When here is cure?--for Life, that, like a lob,"
3778,XI,"Rides us to death; for Love, a godless lie;"

3784,XII,"Then seemed I wrapped in rolling mists, and, oh,"

3786,XII,"On eyes and lips, and words that none may know--"
3787,XII,What words of promise said she in mine ear!
3788,XII,"Drunk with her beauty still I felt no fear,"
3789,XII,"When, past the forest, like some bounding brute,"
3790,XII,"I heard the river roaring. Drawing near,"
3791,XII,"Again she whispered, and my soul grew mute"
3792,XII,Before her voice that lulled like music of a lute:
3793,XII,
3794,XII,
3795,XIII,XIII
3796,XIII,
3797,XIII,"""Within the webs of darkness and of day"
3798,XIII,"The spider Hours spin about thy world,"
3799,XIII,"Who now finds time to even laugh or pray,"
3800,XIII,Cramped in a term of years that are uncurled
3801,XIII,"Like coils of some huge monster, head uphurled"
3802,XIII,To fang when the last fold falls! Slope on slope
3803,XIII,"The night environs thee with space, empearled"
3804,XIII,"With hopeless stars by which men symbol Hope,"
3805,XIII,"Beneath whose light they breed and curse and pray and grope."""
3806,XIII,

3808,XIV,XIV
3809,XIV,
3810,XIV,And so she brought me to the river's brink
3811,XIV,To plunge me downward. All the night was mine;
3812,XIV,"And so, exulting, to Death's darker drink"
3813,XIV,"I stooped and drank.--What better drink divine,"
3814,XIV,"O man, hast thou? what wiser way is thine?"
3815,XIV,"Who find'st me carrion on a hungry coast,"
3816,XIV,"Sand in mine eyeballs, in my hair the brine,"

3830,I,"What would you have when such is the fashion,"
3831,I,Was and will be of the world we are in?

4072,FACE TO FACE,

4126,FACE TO FACE,Led by lights and slain....
4127,FACE TO FACE,
4128,FACE TO FACE,"Woman true, I falsely blamed;"
4129,FACE TO FACE,Whom I killed with scorn and pride;

4133,FACE TO FACE,"All you said, Sweet, has come true!--"
4134,FACE TO FACE,Ah! this life had woe enough

4150,FACE TO FACE,Better for me in His sight
4151,FACE TO FACE,With my soul washed clean.

4153,FACE TO FACE,Do you hear me? do you know

4159,FACE TO FACE,"Sweet, good-by. Upon your breast"
4160,FACE TO FACE,Let this long white lily rest--
4161,FACE TO FACE,God will find it there:

4449,VI,imitating Browning's _The Laboratory_. The truth of the matter

4451,VI,"Browning's _Dramatic Lyrics_, and was suggested to me by the"
4452,VI,reading of the following passage in one of E. T. W. Hoffman's

4454,VI,"De Scuderi_ and is as follows: ""The poisons which Sainte Croix"
4455,VI,prepared were of so subtle a nature that if the powder (called by
4456,VI,"the Parisians _Poudre de Succession_, or Succession Powder) were"
4457,VI,"prepared with the face exposed, a single inhalation of it might"
4458,VI,"cause instantaneous death. Sainte Croix therefore, when engaged"
4459,VI,"in its manufacture, always wore a mask of fine glass. One day,"
4460,VI,"just as he was pouring a prepared powder into a phial, his mask"
4461,VI,"fell off, and inhaling the fine particles of the poison, he fell"
4462,VI,"dead on the spot."""

4901,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Followed, and after many stormy moons,"
4902,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Within the land of giants overcome,"
4903,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"In Jotunheim, and dragged beneath the world,"
4904,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Into a cave the earthquake's hands had built,"
4905,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"A cavern vast and terrible as that,"
4906,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"They tell of Hel's, whose ceiling is of snakes,"
4907,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"That hang, a torrent torture, yawning slime,"
4908,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,In whose slow stream eternal anguish wades.
4909,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And for his crimes they chained him to a rock,"
4910,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"His lips still sneering and his eyes all scorn,"
4911,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And left him with the serpent over him,"
4912,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And, gathering round him from their larvæ lairs,"
4913,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Monsters, huge-warted, eyed with wells of fire."
4914,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"But Sigyn, Loké's wife, stole in to him,"
4915,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And sate herself beside his writhen limbs,"
4916,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And held a cup of gold against the mouth
4917,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Of ceaseless poison dripping in the gloom.
4918,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Was it her voice lamenting? or the sound
4919,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Of far abysmal waters falling, falling"
4920,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Down tortured labyrinths of hollow rock?
4921,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Or was't the Strömkarl? he whose hoary harp
4922,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Is heard remote; who, syllabling strange runes,"
4923,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Sits gray behind the crashing cataract,"
4924,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Within a grotto dim with mist and foam;
4925,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"His long thin beard, white as the flying spray,"
4926,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Slow-swinging in the wind and keeping time
4927,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"To his wild harp's notes, murmuring, whispering"
4928,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Beneath the talons of his hands of foam.
4929,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,
4930,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Was it the voice of Sigyn? whose sad sound
4931,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Soft from the deathless hush detached itself,"
4932,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,As some pale star from darkness that reveals
4933,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The heavens in its fall; or but the deeps
4934,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Of silence speaking to the deeps of night?
4935,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Sad, sad, and slow, yea slower than sad tears"
4936,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"That fall from blinded eyes, her sad words fell:--"
4937,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"""O Love! O Loké! turn on me thine eyes!"
4938,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Thy motionless eyes that woe has changed to stone;
4939,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,That slumber will not seal nor any dream.
4940,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Yea, I will woo her down; woo Slumber down,"
4941,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"From her fair far-off skies, with some old song,"
4942,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The croonéd syllables of some refrain,"
4943,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Sung unto childhood by the mothers of men.
4944,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Or shall I soothe thine eyes shut with my hair,"
4945,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The fluttered amber of deep curls, until"
4946,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"They shall forget their stone stolidity,"
4947,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And sleep creep in between the linéd lids
4948,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And summon memory and pain away?
4949,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,
4950,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"""Pale, pale thy face, that seems to stain the night"
4951,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,With pallor; hueless as the brows of death.
4952,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"So pale, that knew we Death, as mortals know,"
4953,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"I'd say that he, mysterious, had laid hands"
4954,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Of talons on thee and had left thee so.
4955,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,So still! and all the night is in my heart.
4956,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"So tired! and sleep is not for thee or me,"
4957,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Never again for our o'erweary limbs!
4958,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Around, the shadows crouch; vague, obscene shapes,"
4959,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"In horrible attitudes; and all the night,"
4960,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Above, below, seems so much choking fog,"
4961,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"That clogs my tongue, or with devouring maw"
4962,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Swallows my words and makes them sound far off,"
4963,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Remote, deep down, emboweled of the Earth."
4964,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And then again it hounds them from my tongue
4965,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,To sound as wildly clamorous as the hills
4966,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Sound when Earth shakes with armies; men that meet
4967,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"With Berserk fury, shouting, and the hurl"
4968,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And shock of iron spears on iron shields,"
4969,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And all the world is one wild wave of helms,"
4970,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And all the air is one wild wind of swords,"
4971,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,On which the wild Valkyries ride and scream.
4972,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Dread cliffs, dread chasms of rocks howl back my words"
4973,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,While yet they touch the tongue to grasp the thought;
4974,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And all the vermin, huddled in their holes,"
4975,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Creep forth to glare and hiss them back again.
4976,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,
4977,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"""How long! how long ago since we beheld"
4978,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The rose of morning and the lily of noon,"
4979,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The great red rhododendron of the eve!
4980,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,How long! how long ago since we beheld
4981,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Those thoughts of God, the stars, that set their flowers"
4982,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Imperishably in the fields of heaven,"
4983,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And the still changing yet unchanging moon!
4984,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"So long, that I unto myself seem grown,"
4985,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"As thou, long since, to rock; in sympathy"
4986,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,With all the rock above us and around.
4987,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"My countenance hath won, long since, with thee,"
4988,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The reflex of an alabaster black
4989,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"That builds vast walls around us, and whose frown"
4990,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Makes stone thy brow as mine. O woe! O woe!
4991,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And now that Idun's apples are denied,"
4992,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Are not for lips of thee nor lips of me,--"
4993,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The apples of gold that still keep young the gods,--"
4994,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The years shall cleave this beautiful brow of thine
4995,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"With myriad wrinkles; and, in time, this hair,"
4996,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Brown, brown, and softer than the fur of seals,"
4997,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Shall lose its lustre and instead shall lie,"
4998,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"A drift of winter in a winter cave,"
4999,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,A feeble gray seen in the glimmering gloom.
5000,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"But I shall age, too, even as thou dost age."
5001,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Yet, yet we can not die; the immortal gods"
5002,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Can never die! what punishment to know!
5003,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,What pain to know we age yet can not die!
5004,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Death will not come except with Ragnarok.--
5005,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"That thought be near! take comfort from the word,"
5006,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The dark word Ragnarok, which is thyself;"
5007,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Thy vast revenge; thy monster synonym;
5008,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Thy banquet of destruction. Thou, whom fate,"
5009,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The Norns, reserve to war and waste the worlds"
5010,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Of gods and men, with thy two henchmen huge,"
5011,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The wolf and snake, the Fenris, that devours,"
5012,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The Midgard, that engulfs the universe."
5013,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"O joy! O joy! then shall those stars, that glue"
5014,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Their blinking scales unto old Ymer's skull,--"
5015,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The dome of heaven,--shudder from their spheres,"
5016,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"A streaming fire; and thou, O Loké, thou,"
5017,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Elected annihilation, shalt arise,"
5018,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,To devastate the Earth and Asaheim.
5019,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And as this darkness now, this heavy night,"
5020,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Clings to and chokes us till we, strangling, strive"
5021,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"With purple lips for light, and feel the dark"
5022,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Drag freezing down the throat to swell the weight
5023,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"That houses in our hearts and peoples our veins,"
5024,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,So shall thy hate insufferably spread
5025,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"In fires of Hel, in fogs of Niflheim,"
5026,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Storm-like from pole to pole, o'erwhelming all.--"
5027,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The Twilight of the Gods, behold, it comes!"
5028,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The Twilight of the Gods!--The root-red cock
5029,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,I seem to hear crow in the halls of Hel!
5030,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The blood-red cock, whose cry shall bid thee rise!"
5031,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,
5032,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"""But, oh! thy face! paler it seemeth now"
5033,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Than icy marble; and the serpent writhes
5034,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Its rustling coils and twists its livid length,"
5035,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Hissing, above thee, pouring eternal pain.--"
5036,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Oh, could I kiss the lips o'er which he swings!"
5037,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The lips that once touched living flame to mine!
5038,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"At which sweet thought, as some sick flower of drought"
5039,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"At dreams of dew, my lips with longing ache!"
5040,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"--Oh, could I gaze once more into thine eyes"
5041,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Whose starry depths outstarred the midnight heavens!
5042,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Or see them laugh as golden morning laughs,"
5043,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Leaving her steps in roses on the hills,"
5044,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The peaks that wall the world and pierce the clouds;
5045,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The hills, where once we stood, among the pines,"
5046,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The melancholy pines that plume the crags,"
5047,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And rock and sing unto the still fiords
5048,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Like gaunt wild-women lullabying their babes!
5049,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Then could I die e'en as the mortals die,"
5050,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And smile in dying!--But the serpent baulks
5051,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Each effort to behold, or on loved lips"
5052,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,To ease the torture of my soul's desire.
5053,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Thy face alone is comfort to my gaze,"
5054,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Like some dim moon silvering through night and mist.
5055,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,--Now from their lairs again the monsters creep;
5056,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"I feel their ghastly touches, and their eyes"
5057,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Draw steadily nearer, wandering will-o'-the-wisps;"
5058,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The serpent strives to fang me as he swings;
5059,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"And in the cup's caked gold the venom swims,"
5060,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Seethes upward horribly to the horrible edge."""
5061,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"She ceased. And then, heard through the echoing night,"
5062,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The chained god spoke, tumultuous violence"
5063,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And rage in every word. His utterance seemed
5064,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Large as the thunder when it, rolling, plants,--"
5065,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Heavy with earthquake and impending ruin,--"
5066,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Seismic feet on everlasting seas
5067,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And mountains silent with eternal ice.
5068,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"His eyes in hideous labor; and his throat,"
5069,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Corded and gnarled with veins of boisterous blood,"
5070,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"A crag of fury; and his foaming lips,"
5071,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"A maelstrom of rebellious agony,"
5072,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Of thwarted rage and wild, arrested wrath."
5073,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Fierce vaunter of loud hate, one mighty fist,"
5074,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Convulsed with clenchment, in its gyve of ore,"
5075,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Headlong for battle-launching, at the gods"
5076,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Clutched mad defiance, madder blasphemy;"
5077,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Yet all unhurled and vain as mists of morn,"
5078,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Or foam, wind-wasted on the sterile sands"
5079,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Of rainy seas, when Ran, from whistling caves,"
5080,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Watching the tempest-driven dragon wreck,"
5081,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Already in her miser fingers feels
5082,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The viking gold that has not yet gone down.
5083,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Then all the cave again is dumb with night.
5084,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,He sees the spotted serpent writhe above;
5085,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,He sees the poison streaming towards his eyes.
5086,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And now her cup is brimmed; but one more drop
5087,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Will float the filth gray o'er the venomed edge.
5088,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Into the river slowly flowing by
5089,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Swiftly she pours the vitriol torture: scarce
5090,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"A tithe of time it takes, but in that time"
5091,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The reptile's vomit slimes his helpless face,"
5092,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Burns to the bone.... All his fierce muscles twist,"
5093,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"Wrenching the knotted steel that locks his limbs,"
5094,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,And shriek on shriek divides the solitudes.
5095,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,"The ocean roars; and, under toppling skies,"
5096,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,The mountains avalanche from pine-pierced sides
5097,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Their centuries of snow. Then all the night
5098,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,Once more is filled with silence and with sighs.
5099,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,
5100,LOKÉ AND SIGYN,

5151,YULE,of sleet;
5152,YULE,And the boom of the sea and the moaning of pines in its desolate beat.
5153,YULE,
5154,YULE,And the hall of fierce Erick of Sogn with the clamor of wassail was
5155,YULE,"filled,"
5156,YULE,With the clash of great beakers of gold and the reek of the ale that
5157,YULE,was spilled.

5159,YULE,"For the Yule was upon them, the Yule; and they quaffed as from skulls"

5162,YULE,again.
5163,YULE,
5164,YULE,"Unharnessed from each shaggy throat, that was hot with brute lust and"

5168,YULE,
5169,YULE,"For the Yule was upon them, the Yule, and the _waesheils_ were shouted"

5173,YULE,
5174,YULE,"And huge on the hearth, that writhed, hissing, and bellied, an ingot"
5175,YULE,"of gold,"
5176,YULE,"The Yule-log, the half of an oak from the mountains, was royally"
5177,YULE,rolled.
5178,YULE,
5179,YULE,"And its warmth and its glory, that glared, smote red through the width"

5183,YULE,
5184,YULE,"And the maidens, who hurried big goblets, that bubbled, excessive with"

5186,YULE,Blushed rose to the gold of thick curls as the shining steel mirrored
5187,YULE,each charm.

5189,YULE,"And Erick's one hundred gray skalds, at the nod and the beck of the"

5191,YULE,With the stormy-rolled music of an hundred wild harps made the castle
5192,YULE,reëchoing ring.

5201,YULE,
5202,YULE,"Behold! for the battle was ended; the battle that clamored all day,"
5203,YULE,With the rumble of shields that were shocked and of spears that were
5204,YULE,splintered like spray:
5205,YULE,
5206,YULE,With the hewing of swords that fierce-lightened like flames and that
5207,YULE,"smoked with hot blood,"
5208,YULE,And the crush of the mace that was hammered through helm and through
5209,YULE,brain that withstood:
5210,YULE,
5211,YULE,"And the cursing and howling of men at their gods,--at their gods whom"
5212,YULE,"they cursed,"
5213,YULE,Till the caves of the ocean re-bellowed and storm on their battling
5214,YULE,burst.
5215,YULE,
5216,YULE,And they fought; in the flying and drifting and silence of covering
5217,YULE,"snow,"
5218,YULE,"Till the wounded that lay with the dead, with the dead were stiff"
5219,YULE,frozen in woe.
5220,YULE,
5221,YULE,And they fought; and the mystical flakes that were clutched by the

5223,YULE,"Drave sharp on the eyes of the kings, made the sight of their warriors"
5224,YULE,blind.
5225,YULE,
5226,YULE,"Still they fought; and with leonine wrath were they met, till the"

5228,YULE,"In his thunder-wheeled chariot rolled, making end of destruction and"
5229,YULE,war.
5230,YULE,
5231,YULE,"And they fell--like twin rocks of the mountains, or pines, that rush,"
5232,YULE,"hurricane-hurled,"
5233,YULE,From their world-rooted crags to the ocean below with the wreck of the
5234,YULE,world.
5235,YULE,
5236,YULE,"But, lo! not in vain their loud vows! on the black iron altars of War"

5243,YULE,
5244,YULE,"Yea, the halls of fierce Erick of Sogn with the turmoil of wassail"

5291,ACCOLON OF GAUL,
5292,ACCOLON OF GAUL,_Prelude_
5293,ACCOLON OF GAUL,
5294,ACCOLON OF GAUL,O wondrous legends from the storied wells
5295,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of lost Baranton! where old Merlin dwells,"
5296,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Nodding a white poll and a grave, gray beard,"
5297,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"As if some Lake Ladyé he, listening, heard,"
5298,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Who spake like water, danced like careful showers"
5299,ACCOLON OF GAUL,With blown gold curls through drifts of wild-thorn flowers;
5300,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Loose, lazy arms upon her bosom crossed,"
5301,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"An instant seen, and in an instant lost,"
5302,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"With one peculiar note, like that you hear"
5303,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Dropped by a reed-bird when the night is near,"
5304,ACCOLON OF GAUL,A vocal gold blown through the atmosphere.
5305,ACCOLON OF GAUL,
5306,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Lo! dreams from dreams in dreams remembered. Naught
5307,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"That matters much, save that it seemed I thought"
5308,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"I wandered dim with some one, but I knew"
5309,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Not whom; most beautiful, and young, and true,"
5310,ACCOLON OF GAUL,And pale through suffering: with curl-crowned brow
5311,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Soft eyes and voice, so strange, they haunt me now--"
5312,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"A dream, perhaps, in dreamland."
5313,ACCOLON OF GAUL,
5314,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Seemed that she
5315,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Led me along a flower-showered lea
5316,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Trammeled with puckered pansy and the pea;
5317,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Where poppies spread great blood-red stain on stain,"
5318,ACCOLON OF GAUL,So gorged with sunlight and the honeyed rain
5319,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Their hearts were weary; roses lavished beams;
5320,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Roses, wherein were huddled little dreams"
5321,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"That laughed coy, sidewise merriment, like dew,"
5322,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Or from fair fingers fragrant kisses blew.
5323,ACCOLON OF GAUL,And suddenly a river cleft the sward;
5324,ACCOLON OF GAUL,And o'er it lay a mist: and it was hard
5325,ACCOLON OF GAUL,To see whence came it; whitherward it led;
5326,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Like some wild, frightened thing, it foamed and fled,"
5327,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Sighing and murmuring, from its fountain-head."
5328,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And following it, at last I came upon"
5329,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"The Region of Romance,--from whence were drawn"
5330,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Its wandering waters,--and the storied wells"
5331,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of lost Baranton, where old Merlin dwells,"
5332,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Nodding a white poll and a great, gray beard."
5333,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And then, far off, a woman's voice I heard,"
5334,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Wilder than water, laughing in the bowers,"
5335,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Like some strange bird: and then, through wild-thorn flowers,"
5336,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"I saw her limbs glance, twinkling as spring showers;"
5337,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And then, with blown gold curls, tempestuous tossed,"
5338,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"White as a wood-nymph, she a vista crossed,"
5339,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Laughing that laugh wherein there was no cheer,"
5340,ACCOLON OF GAUL,But soulless scorn. And so to me drew near
5341,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Her sweet lascivious brow's white wonderment,"
5342,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And gray, great eyes, and hair which had the scent"
5343,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Of all the wild Brécèliande's perfumes
5344,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Drowned in it; and, a flame in gold, one bloom's"
5345,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Blood-point thrust deep. And, ""Viviane! Viviane!"""
5346,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"The wild seemed crying, as if swept with rain;"
5347,ACCOLON OF GAUL,And all the young leaves laughed; and surge on surge
5348,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Swept the witch-haunted forest to its verge,"
5349,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"That shook and sighed and stammered, as, in sleep,"
5350,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"A giant half-aroused: and, with a leap,"
5351,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"That samite-hazy creature, blossom-white,"
5352,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Showered mocking kisses down; then, like a light"
5353,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Beat into gusty flutterings by the dawn,"
5354,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Then quenched, she glimmered and, behold, was gone;"
5355,ACCOLON OF GAUL,And in Brécèliande I stood alone
5356,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Gazing at Merlin, sitting on a stone;"
5357,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Old Merlin, charmed there, dreaming drowsy dreams;"
5358,ACCOLON OF GAUL,A wondrous company; as many as gleams
5359,ACCOLON OF GAUL,That stab the moted mazes of a beech.
5360,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And each grave dream, behold, had power to reach"
5361,ACCOLON OF GAUL,My mind through magic; each one following each
5362,ACCOLON OF GAUL,In dim procession; and their beauty drew
5363,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Tears down my cheeks, and Merlin's gray cheeks, too,--"
5364,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"One in his beard hung tangled, bright as dew.--"
5365,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Long pageants seemed to pass me, brave and fair,"
5366,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of courts and tournaments, with silvery blare"
5367,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Of immaterial trumpets high in air;
5368,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And blazoned banners, shields, and many a spear"
5369,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of Uther, waved an incorporeal fear:"
5370,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"And forms of Arthur rose and Guenevere,"
5371,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of Tristram and of Isoud and of Mark,"
5372,ACCOLON OF GAUL,And many others; glimmering in the dark
5373,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of Merlin's mind, they rose and glared and then,--"
5374,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"The instant's fostered phantoms,--passed again."
5375,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Then all around me seemed a rippling stir
5376,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Of silken something,--wilier, lovelier"
5377,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Than that witch-mothered beauty, Viviane,--"
5378,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Approaching with dead knights amid her train,"
5379,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Pale through the vast Brécèliande. And then
5380,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"A knight, steel-helmeted, a man of men,"
5381,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Passed with a fool, King Arthur's Dagonet,"
5382,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Who on his head a tinsel crown had set
5383,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"In mockery. And as he went his way,"
5384,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Behind the knight the leaves began to sway,"
5385,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"Then slightly parted--and Morgane le Fay,"
5386,ACCOLON OF GAUL,"With haughty, wicked eyes and lovely face,"
5387,ACCOLON OF GAUL,Studied him steadily a little space.
5388,ACCOLON OF GAUL,
5389,ACCOLON OF GAUL,
5390,I,I
5391,I,
5392,I,"""Again I hold thee to my heart, Morgane;"
5393,I,Here where the restless forest hears the main
5394,I,"Toss as in troubled sleep. Now hear me, sweet,"
5395,I,"While I that dream of yesternight repeat."""
5396,I,
5397,I,"""First let us find some rock or mossed retreat"
5398,I,Where we may sit at ease.--Why dost thou look
5399,I,"So serious? Nay! learn lightness from this brook,"
5400,I,"And gladness from these flowers, my Accolon."
5401,I,See the wild vista there! where purpling run
5402,I,Long woodland shadows from the sinking sun;
5403,I,"Deeper the wood seems there, secluded as"
5404,I,"The tame wild-deer that, in the moss and grass,"
5405,I,Gaze with their human eyes. Where grow those lines
5406,I,"Of pale-starred green; and where yon fountain shines,"
5407,I,"Urned deep in tremulous ferns, let's rest upon"
5408,I,Yon oak-trunk by the tempest overthrown
5409,I,"Years, years ago. See, how 'tis rotted brown!"
5410,I,But here the red bark's firm and overgrown
5411,I,Of trailing ivy darkly berried. Share
5412,I,"My throne with me. Come, cast away thy care!"
5413,I,"Sit here and breathe with me this wildwood air,"
5414,I,Musk with the wood's decay that fills each way;
5415,I,"As if some shrub, while dreaming of the May,"
5416,I,In longing languor weakly tried to wake
5417,I,Its perished blossoms and could only make
5418,I,"Ghosts of such dead aromas as it knew,"
5419,I,And shape a spectre of invisible dew
5420,I,"To haunt these sounding miles of solitude."""
5421,I,
5422,I,"""Still, thou art troubled, Morgane! and the mood,"
5423,I,"Deep in thy fathomless eyes, glows.--Canst not keep"
5424,I,Mine eyes from seeing!--Dark thy thought and deep
5425,I,"As that of some wild woman,--found asleep"
5426,I,"By some lost knight upon a precipice,--"
5427,I,Whom he hath wakened with a sudden kiss:
5428,I,"As that of some frail elfin lady,--light"
5429,I,"As are the foggy moonbeams,--filmy white,"
5430,I,"Who waves diaphanous beauty on a cliff,"
5431,I,"That, drowsing, purrs with moon-drenched pines; but if"
5432,I,"The lone knight follow, foul fiends rise and drag"
5433,I,"Him crashing down, while she, tall on the crag,"
5434,I,"Triumphant, mocks him with glad sorcery"
5435,I,"Till all the wildwood echoes shout with glee."""
5436,I,
5437,I,"""Follow thy figure further, Accolon."
5438,I,"Right fair it is. Too soon, alas! art done,"""
5439,I,"Said she; and tossing back her heavy hair,"
5440,I,"Said smilingly, yet with a certain air"
5441,I,"Of hurt impatience, ""Why dost not compare"
5442,I,"This dark expression of my eyes, ah me!"
5443,I,"To something darker? say, it is to thee"
5444,I,"As some bewildering mystery of a tarn,"
5445,I,"A mountain water, that the mornings scorn"
5446,I,To anadem with fire and leave gray;
5447,I,To which a champion cometh when the day
5448,I,Hath tired of breding for the twilight's head
5449,I,"Flame-petaled blooms, and, golden-chapleted,"
5450,I,"Sits waiting, rosy with deep love, for night,"
5451,I,Who cometh sandaled with the moon; the light
5452,I,Of the auroras round her; her vast hair
5453,I,"Tortuous with stars,--that burn, as in a lair"
5454,I,"The eyes of hunted wild things glare with rage,--"
5455,I,"And on her bosom doth his love assuage."""
5456,I,
5457,I,"""Yea, even so,"" said Accolon, his eyes"
5458,I,"Searching her face: ""the knight, as I surmise,"
5459,I,"Who cometh heated to that haunted place,"
5460,I,"Stoops down to lave his forehead, and his face"
5461,I,Meets fairy faces; elfins in a ring
5462,I,"That shadow upward, smiling, beckoning"
5463,I,"Down, down to wonders, magic built of old"
5464,I,"For some dim witch.--A city walled with gold,"
5465,I,With beryl battlements and paved with pearls;
5466,I,Its lambent towers wrought of foamy swirls
5467,I,Of alabaster; and that witch to love
5468,I,More beautiful than any queen above.--
5469,I,"He pauses, troubled: but a wizard power,"
5470,I,"In all his bronzen harness, that mad hour"
5471,I,Plunges him--whither? What if he should miss
5472,I,Those cloudy beauties and that creature's kiss?--
5473,I,"Ah, Morgane, that same power Accolon"
5474,I,"Found potent in thine eyes, and it hath drawn"
5475,I,"And plunged him--whither? yea, to what far fate?"
5476,I,"To what dim end? what veiled and future state?"""
5477,I,
5478,I,"With shadowy eyes long, long she gazed in his,"
5479,I,"Then whispered dreamily the one word, ""Bliss."""
5480,I,And like an echo on his sad mouth sate
5481,I,"The answer:--""Bliss?--deep have we drunk of late!"
5482,I,"But death, I feel, some stealthy-footed death"
5483,I,Draws near! whose claws will clutch away--whose breath?...
5484,I,"I dreamed last night thou gather'dst flowers with me,"
5485,I,Fairer than those of earth. And I did see
5486,I,"How woolly gold they were, how woven through"
5487,I,"With fluffy flame, and webby with spun dew:"
5488,I,"And 'Asphodels' I murmured: then, 'These sure"
5489,I,"Are Eden amaranths, so angel pure"
5490,I,That love alone may touch them.'--Thou didst lay
5491,I,The flowers in my hands; alas! then gray
5492,I,"The world grew; and, meseemed, I passed away."
5493,I,"In some strange manner on a misty brook,"
5494,I,"Between us flowing, striving still to look"
5495,I,"Beyond it, while, around, the wild air shook"
5496,I,"With torn farewells of pensive melody,"
5497,I,Aching with tears and hopeless utterly;
5498,I,"So merciless near, meseemed that I did hear"
5499,I,"That music in those flowers, and yearned to tear"
5500,I,"Their ingot-cored and gold-crowned hearts, and hush"
5501,I,Their voices into silence and to crush:
5502,I,Yet o'er me was a something that restrained:
5503,I,The melancholy presence of two pained
5504,I,"And awful, burning eyes that cowed and held"
5505,I,My spirit while that music died or swelled
5506,I,"Far out on shoreless waters, borne away--"
5507,I,"Like some wild-bird, that, blinded with the ray"
5508,I,"Of dawn it wings tow'rds, lifting high its crest,"
5509,I,"The glory round it, sings its heavenliest,"
5510,I,"When suddenly all's changed; with drooping head,"
5511,I,"Daggered of thorns it plunged on, fluttering, dead,"
5512,I,"Still, still it seems to sing, though wrapped in night,"
5513,I,The slow blood beading on its breast of white.--
5514,I,And then I knew the flowers which thou hadst given
5515,I,Were strays of parting grief and waifs of heaven
5516,I,For tears and memories. Importunate
5517,I,They spoke to me of loves that separate!--
5518,I,"But, God! ah God! my God! thus was I left!"
5519,I,And these were with me who was so bereft.
5520,I,The haunting torment of that dream of grief
5521,I,"Weighs on my soul and gives me no relief."""
5522,I,
5523,I,"He bowed and wept into his hands; and she,"
5524,I,"Sorrowing beheld. Then, resting at her knee,"
5525,I,Raised slow her oblong lute and smote some chords.
5526,I,"But ere the impulse saddened into words,"
5527,I,"Said: ""And didst love me as thy lips would prove,"
5528,I,No visions wrought of sleep might move thy love.
5529,I,Firm is all love in firmness of his power;
5530,I,"With flame, reverberant, moated stands his tower;"
5531,I,So built as not to admit from fact a beam
5532,I,"Of doubt, and much less of a doubt from dream:"
5533,I,"All such th' alchemic fire of love's desires,--"
5534,I,"That moats its tower with flame,--turns to gold wires"
5535,I,"To chord the old lyre new whereon he lyres."""
5536,I,"She ceased; and then, sad softness in her eye,"
5537,I,Sang to his dream a questioning reply:--
5538,I,
5539,I,"""Will love be less, when dead the roguish Spring,"
5540,I,"Who, with white hands, sowed violets, whispering?"
5541,I,"When petals of her cheeks, wan-wasted through"
5542,I,"Of withering grief, are laid beneath the dew,"
5543,I,Will love be less?
5544,I,
5545,I,"""Will love be less, when comes the Summer tall?"
5546,I,"Her throat a lily, long and spiritual:"
5547,I,"When like a poppied swath,--hushed haunt of bees,--"
5548,I,"Her form is laid in slumber on the leas,"
5549,I,Will love be less?
5550,I,
5551,I,"""Will love be less, when Autumn, sighing there,"
5552,I,"Droops with long frost streaks in her dark, dark hair?"
5553,I,"When her grave eyes are closed to heaven above,"
5554,I,"Deep, lost in memory's melancholy, love,"
5555,I,Will love be less?
5556,I,
5557,I,"""Will love be less, when Winter at the door"
5558,I,"Shakes from gray locks th' icicles, long and hoar?"
5559,I,"When Death's eyes, hollow o'er his shoulder, dart"
5560,I,"Dark looks that wring with tears, then freeze the heart,"
5561,I,"Will love be less?"""
5562,I,
5563,I,"And in her hair wept softly, and her breast"
5564,I,"Rose and was wet with tears--as when, distressed,"
5565,I,"Night steals on day, rain sobbing through her curls.--"
5566,I,
5567,I,"""Though tears become thee even as priceless pearls,"
5568,I,"Weep not, Morgane.--Mine no gloom of doubt,"
5569,I,"But grief for sweet love's death I dreamed about,"""
5570,I,"He said. ""May love, the flame-anointed, be"
5571,I,"Lord of our hearts, and king eternally!"
5572,I,"Love, ruler of our lives, whose power shall cease"
5573,I,No majesty when we are laid at peace;
5574,I,"But still shall reign, when souls have loved thus well,"
5575,I,"Our god in Heaven or our god in Hell."""
5576,I,
5577,I,"So they communed. Afar her castle stood,"
5578,I,Its slender towers glimmering through the wood:
5579,I,"A forest lodge rose, ivy-buried, near"
5580,I,A woodland vista where faint herds of deer
5581,I,"Stalked like soft shadows: where, with many a run,"
5582,I,Mavis and throstle caroled in the sun:
5583,I,And where through trees was seen a surf-white shore.
5584,I,"For this was Morgane's realm, embowered Gore;"
5585,I,"And that her castle, sea-built Chariot,"
5586,I,"That rooky pile, where, she a while forgot"
5587,I,"Urience, her husband, now at Camelot."
5588,I,Hurt in that battle where King Arthur strove
5589,I,"With the Five Heathen Kings, and, slaying, drove"
5590,I,"The Five before him, Accolon was borne"
5591,I,To a gray castle on his shield one morn;--
5592,I,"A castle like a dream, set high in scorn"
5593,I,"Above the world and all its hungry herds,"
5594,I,"Belted with woods melodious with birds,"
5595,I,"Far from the rush of spears and roar of swords,"
5596,I,"And the loud shields of battle-bloody lords,"
5597,I,And fields of silent slain where Havoc sprawled
5598,I,"Gorged to her eyes with carnage.--Dim, high-halled,"
5599,I,And hushed it rose; and through the granite-walled
5600,I,"Huge gate, and court, up stairs of marble sheen,"
5601,I,"Six damsels bore him, tiremaids of a queen,"
5602,I,"Stately and dark, who moved as if a flame"
5603,I,Of starlight shone around her; and who came
5604,I,"With healing herbs and searched his wounds. A dame,"
5605,I,"So radiant in raiment silvery,"
5606,I,"So white, that she attendant seemed to be"
5607,I,"On that high Holy Grail, which evermore"
5608,I,The Table Round hath sought by wood and shore;
5609,I,"The angel-guarded cup of mystery,"
5610,I,That but the pure in body and soul may see;--
5611,I,"Thus not for him, a worldly one, to love,"
5612,I,Who loved her even to wonder; skied above
5613,I,"His worship as the moon above the main,"
5614,I,"That strives and strives to reach her, pale with pain,"
5615,I,"She with her peaceful, pitiless, virgin cheer"
5616,I,Watching his suffering year on weary year.--
5617,I,"To Accolon such seemed she: Then, too late,"
5618,I,"His heart's ideal, merciless as fate!"
5619,I,For whom his soul must yearn till death; and wait
5620,I,"And dream of; evermore with sighs and tears,"
5621,I,"Through the long waste of unavailing years,"
5622,I,Seeing her ever luminously stand
5623,I,"In luminous heavens, beckoning with her hand:"
5624,I,"Before which vision heart and soul were weak,"
5625,I,"And dumb with love, that would, yet could not speak.--"
5626,I,Her beauty filled him with divine despair.
5627,I,"Around his heart she seemed to wrap her hair,"
5628,I,"Her raven hair, and drag him to his doom;"
5629,I,Her looks were splendid daggers in the gloom
5630,I,"Of his sick soul, his heart's invaded tower,"
5631,I,"Stabbing, yet never slaying, every hour."
5632,I,"Thus worshiping that queen, Morgane le Fay,"
5633,I,"For many a day within his room he lay,"
5634,I,"Longing to live now, then again to die,"
5635,I,"As now her face, or now her glancing eye,"
5636,I,"Bade his heart hope, with smiled approval of"
5637,I,"His passion; now despair, with scorn of love;"
5638,I,"His love, that dragged itself before her feet,"
5639,I,"Dog-like, to whom even a blow were sweet."
5640,I,"Ah, never dreamed he of what was to be,--"
5641,I,"Nay, nay! how could he? while the agony"
5642,I,"Of his unworth possessed his soul so much,"
5643,I,He never thought such loveliness and such
5644,I,"Perfection ever could stoop from its heaven,"
5645,I,"Far as his world, and to his arms be given."
5646,I,
5647,I,One night a tempest tore and tossed and lashed
5648,I,"The writhing forest, and deep thunders dashed"
5649,I,"Sonorous shields together; and anon,"
5650,I,"Vast in the thunder's pause, the sea would groan"
5651,I,Like some enormous curse a knight hath lured
5652,I,From where it soared to maim it with his sword.
5653,I,"And Accolon, from where he lay, could see"
5654,I,"The stormy, wide-wrenched night's immensity"
5655,I,"Yawn hells of golden ghastliness, and sweep"
5656,I,"Distending foam, tempestuous, up each steep"
5657,I,"Of raucous iron. In a fever-fit,"
5658,I,"He seemed to see, on crags the lightning lit,"
5659,I,"With tangled hair wild-blown, nude mermaids sit,"
5660,I,"Singing, and beckoning with foam-white arms"
5661,I,Some far ship struggling with the strangling storm's
5662,I,Resistless exultation. And there came
5663,I,"One breaker, mountained heavenward, all aflame"
5664,I,"With glow-worm green, that boomed against the cliff"
5665,I,"Its bulkéd thunder--and there, pale and stiff,"
5666,I,"Tumbled in eddies of the howling rocks,"
5667,I,"His dead, drawn face, with lidless eyes, and locks"
5668,I,Oozed close with brine; hurled upward streamingly
5669,I,To streaming mermaids. Then he seemed to see
5670,I,"The vampire echoes of the hoarse wood, who,"
5671,I,"With hooting, sought him: down the casement drew"
5672,I,"Wet, shuddering, hag-like fingers; and, at last,"
5673,I,Thronged up the turrets with an elfin blast
5674,I,"Of baffled mockery, and whirled wildly off,"
5675,I,Back to the forest with a maniac scoff.--
5676,I,"Then, far away, hoofs of a hundred gales,"
5677,I,"As wave rams wave up windy bluffs of Wales,"
5678,I,"Loosed from the battlemented hills, the loud"
5679,I,"Herders of tempest drove their herds of cloud,"
5680,I,"That down the rocking night rolled, with the glare"
5681,I,"Of swimming eyeballs, and the hurl of hair,"
5682,I,"Blown, black as rain, from misty-manéd brows,"
5683,I,"And mouths of bellowing storm; in mad carouse,"
5684,I,"With whips of wind, rolling and ruining by,"
5685,I,"Headlong, along the wild and headlong sky."
5686,I,
5687,I,"Once when the lightning made the casement glare,"
5688,I,"Squares touched to gold, athwart it swept her hair,"
5689,I,As if a raven's wing had cut the storm
5690,I,Death-driven seaward. And the vague alarm
5691,I,Of her swift coming filled his soul with hope
5692,I,"And wild surmise, that winged beyond the scope"
5693,I,"Of all his dreams had dreamed of, when he saw"
5694,I,"'Twas she, the all-adored. He felt no awe"
5695,I,"When low she kneeled beside him, beautiful"
5696,I,"As some lone star and white, and said, ""To lull"
5697,I,"Thy soul to sleep, lo, I have come to thee.--"
5698,I,"Didst thou not call me?""--"
5699,I,
5700,I,"""Yea;"" he said. ""Maybe"
5701,I,"Thou heard'st my heart, that calls continually:"
5702,I,"But with my lips I called thee not. But, stay!"
5703,I,The night is wild. Thou wilt not go away!
5704,I,"The night is wild, and it is long till day!"
5705,I,"To see thee like a benediction near,"
5706,I,"To hear thy voice, to have thy cool hand here"
5707,I,Smoothing my feverish brow and matted curls;
5708,I,"To see thy white throat, whiter than its pearls,"
5709,I,Lean o'er me breathing; feel the influence
5710,I,"Of thy large eyes, like stars, whose sole defence"
5711,I,"Against all storm is beauty,--is to see"
5712,I,"And feel a portion of divinity,"
5713,I,"My heart's high dream come true, my dream of dreams!--"""
5714,I,"Then paused and said, ""See, how the tempest streams!"
5715,I,How sweeps the tumult! and the thunder gleams
5716,I,"As, when King Arthur charged on battle-fields"
5717,I,"Of Humber, glared the fiery spears and shields"
5718,I,Of all his knights!--when the Five Kings went down!
5719,I,In the wild hurl of onset overthrown....
5720,I,"But thy white presence, like the moon, has sown"
5721,I,"This room with calm; and all the storm in me,"
5722,I,"The tempest of my soul, dies utterly."
5723,I,So let me feel thy hand upon my cheek.
5724,I,"And speak! I love thy voice: belovéd, speak."""
5725,I,
5726,I,"""Thou lov'st a thing of air, fond Accolon!"
5727,I,Is thy love then so spiritual? Nay! anon
5728,I,"'Twill change, methinks. Whatever may befall,"
5729,I,"Earth-love, thou'lt find, is better, after all.""--"
5730,I,"She smiled; and, sudden, through the moon-rent wall"
5731,I,"Of storm, baptizing moonlight, foot and face,"
5732,I,"Bathed and possessed her, as his soul the grace"
5733,I,"And sweetness of her smile, whose life was brief,"
5734,I,But long enough to heal him of his grief.
5735,I,
5736,I,"""Now rest,"" she said; ""I love thee with much love!--"
5737,I,"Thou didst not know I loved: but God above,"
5738,I,He knew and had divinement.--Winds may blow!--
5739,I,"To lie by thee to-night my mind is. So,""--"
5740,I,"She laughed,--""sleep well!--For me ... give me thy word"
5741,I,Of knighthood!--look thou!... and this naked sword
5742,I,Laid here betwixt us!... Let it be a wall
5743,I,"Strong between love and lust an lov'st me all in all."""
5744,I,
5745,I,Then she unbound the gold that clasped her waist:
5746,I,"Undid her hair: and, like a flower faced,"
5747,I,Stood sweet an unswayed stem that ran to bud
5748,I,In bloom and beauty of young womanhood.
5749,I,And fragrance was to her as natural
5750,I,"As odor to the rose. And white and tall,"
5751,I,"All ardor and all fervor, through the room"
5752,I,"She moved, a presence as of pale perfume."
5753,I,And all his eyes and lips and limbs were fire:
5754,I,"His tongue, delirious, babbled of desire;"
5755,I,"Cried, ""Thine is devil's kindness, which is even"
5756,I,"Worse than fiend's fury, since the soul sees Heaven"
5757,I,Among eternal torments unforgiven.
5758,I,"Temptation neighbored, like a bloody rust"
5759,I,"On a bright blade, leaves ugly stains; and lust"
5760,I,Is love's undoing when love's limbs are cast
5761,I,Naked before desire. What love so chaste
5762,I,But that such nearness of what should be hid
5763,I,Makes it a lawless love?--But thou hast bid.
5764,I,"Rest thou. I love thee; love thee as dost know,"
5765,I,"And all my love shall battle with love's foe."""
5766,I,
5767,I,"""Thy word,"" she said. And pure as peaks that keep"
5768,I,"Snow-drifted crowns, upon him seemed to sweep"
5769,I,An avalanche of virtue in one look.
5770,I,"And he, whose very soul within him shook,"
5771,I,"Exclaimed, ""'Tis thine!""--And hopes, that in his brain"
5772,I,"Had risen with rainbow gleams, set sad as rain"
5773,I,At that high look she gave of chastest pain.
5774,I,"Then turned, his face deep in his hands: and she"
5775,I,Laid the broad blade between them instantly.
5776,I,And so they lay its iron between them twain:
5777,I,"Unsleeping he, for all the brute disdain"
5778,I,Of passion in him struggled up and stood
5779,I,A rebel wrangling with the brain and blood.
5780,I,"An hour stole by: she slept, or seemed to sleep."
5781,I,The winds of night blew vigorous from the deep
5782,I,"With rain-scents of storm-watered wood and wold,"
5783,I,And breathed of ocean breakers moonlight-rolled.
5784,I,He drowsed; and time passed stealing as for one
5785,I,Whose life is but a dream in Avalon.
5786,I,"Vast bulks of black, wind-shattered rack went by"
5787,I,"The casement's square of heaven,--a crystal dye,"
5788,I,"A crown of moonlight, round each cloudy head,--"
5789,I,That seemed the ghosts of giant kings long-dead.
5790,I,"And then he thought she lightly laughed and sighed,"
5791,I,"So soft a taper had not bent aside,"
5792,I,"And leaned her warm face, seen through loosened hair,"
5793,I,"Above him, whispering, soft as is a prayer,"
5794,I,"""Behold! the sword! I take the sword away!"""
5795,I,
5796,I,It curved and clashed where the strewn rushes lay;
5797,I,"Shone glassy, glittering like a watery beam"
5798,I,"Of moonlight, in the moonlight. He did deem"
5799,I,She moved in sleep and dreamed perverse nor wist
5800,I,"The thing she did, until two hot lips kissed"
5801,I,His wondering eyes to knowledge of her thought.
5802,I,"Then said he, ""Love, my word! is it then naught?"""
5803,I,"But now he felt fierce kisses over and over,"
5804,I,"And laughter of ""Thy word?--Art thou my lover?--"
5805,I,"Kisses are more than words!--Come, give them me!--"
5806,I,"As for thy word--I give it back to thee!"""
5807,I,
5808,I,"Sleep is a spirit, who beside us sits,"
5809,I,Or through our frames like some dim glamour flits;
5810,I,"From out her form a pearly light is shed,"
5811,I,"As, from a lily in a lily-bed,"
5812,I,"A firefly's gleam. Her face is pale as stone,"
5813,I,Uncertain as a cloud that lies alone
5814,I,In empty heaven; her diaphanous feet
5815,I,Are easy as the dew or opaline heat
5816,I,Of summer meads. With ears--aurora-pink
5817,I,As dawn's--she leans and listens on the brink
5818,I,"Of being, dark with dreadfulness and doubt,"
5819,I,"Wherein vague lights and shadows move about,"
5820,I,And palpitations beat--like some huge heart
5821,I,Of Earth--the surging pulse of which we're part.
5822,I,"One hand, that hollows her divining eyes,"
5823,I,Glows like the curved moon over twilight skies;
5824,I,And with her gaze she fathoms life and death--
5825,I,"Gulfs, where man's conscience, like a restless breath"
5826,I,"Of wind, goes wandering; whispering low of things,"
5827,I,"The irremediable, where sorrow clings."
5828,I,Around her limbs a veil of woven mist
5829,I,"Wavers, and turns from fibered amethyst"
5830,I,To textured crystal; through which symboled bars
5831,I,"Of silver burn, and cabalistic stars"
5832,I,"Of nebulous gold. Shrouding her feet and hair,"
5833,I,"Within this woof, fantastic, everywhere,"
5834,I,Dreams come and go: the instant images
5835,I,"Of things she sees and thinks; realities,"
5836,I,"Shadows, with which her heart and fancy swarm,"
5837,I,That in the veil take momentary form:
5838,I,"Now picturing heaven in celestial fire,"
5839,I,And now the hell of every soul's desire;
5840,I,"Hinting at worlds, God wraps in mystery,"
5841,I,Beyond the world we touch and know and see.
5842,I,
5843,I,*       *       *       *       *
5844,I,
5845,I,"No, never,--no!--would they forget that night.--"
5846,I,Too soon the sleepy birds awoke the light!
5847,I,"Too soon, for them, trailing gray skirts of breeze,"
5848,I,The drowsy dawn came wandering through the trees.
5849,I,"""Too soon,"" she sighed; and he, ""Alas! too soon!"""
5850,I,"But at their scutcheoned casement, overstrewn"
5851,I,"Of dew and dreams, the dim wind knocked and cried,"
5852,I,"""Arise! come forth, O bridegroom, and O bride!"""
5853,I,
5854,I,
5855,II,II
5856,II,
5857,II,"Morn; and the Autumn, dreaming, sat among"
5858,II,"His ancient hills; Autumn, who now was wrung"
5859,II,"By crafty ministers, sun, rain, and frost,"
5860,II,To don imperial pomp at any cost.
5861,II,"On each wild hill he reared his tents of war,"
5862,II,"Flaunting barbaric standards wide and far,"
5863,II,Around which camp-fires of the red leaves raged:
5864,II,"His tottering state by flattering zephyrs paged,"
5865,II,"Who, in a little fretful while, would soon"
5866,II,Work red rebellion under some wan moon:
5867,II,"Pluck his old beard, deriding; shriek and tear"
5868,II,His royalty; and scatter through the air
5869,II,His tattered majesty: then from his head
5870,II,Dash down its golden crown; and in its stead
5871,II,"Set up a death's-head mockery of snow,"
5872,II,"And leave him stripped, a beggar bowed with woe."
5873,II,"Blow, wood wind, blow! the day is fair and fine"
5874,II,As autumn skies can make it; brisk as brine
5875,II,"The air is, rustling in the underbrush,"
5876,II,"'Mid which the stag-hounds leap, the huntsmen rush."
5877,II,Hark to the horns! the music of the bows!
5878,II,"À mort! à mort!--The hunt is up and goes,"
5879,II,"Beneath the acorn-dropping oaks, in green,--"
5880,II,"Dark woodland green,--a boar-spear held between"
5881,II,His selle and hunter's head; and at his thigh
5882,II,A good broad hanger; and one hand on high
5883,II,"To wind his horn, that startles many a wing,"
5884,II,And makes the forest echoes reel and ring.
5885,II,"Away, away they flash, a belted band"
5886,II,"From Camelot, through the haze-haunted land:"
5887,II,"With many a leamer leashed, and many a hound,"
5888,II,"With mouths of bell-like music, now that bound,"
5889,II,"Uncoupled, forward; for, behold! the hart,"
5890,II,"A ten-tined buck, doth from the covert dart."
5891,II,"And the big stag-hounds swing into the chase,"
5892,II,The wild horns sing. The pryce seems but a pace
5893,II,"On ere 'tis wound. But, see! where interlace"
5894,II,"The dense-briared thickets, now the hounds have lost"
5895,II,"The slot, there where their woodland way is crossed"
5896,II,By intercepting waters full of leaves.
5897,II,
5898,II,"Beyond, the hart a tangled labyrinth weaves"
5899,II,Through deeper boscage; and it seems the sun
5900,II,"Makes many shadowy stags of this wild one,"
5901,II,That lead in different trails the foresters:
5902,II,"And in the trees the ceaseless wind, that stirs,"
5903,II,"Seems some strange witchcraft, that, with baffling mirth,"
5904,II,"Mocks them the unbayed hart, and fills the earth"
5905,II,"With rustling sounds of running.--Hastening thence,"
5906,II,"Galloped King Arthur and King Urience,"
5907,II,With one small brachet-hound. Now far away
5908,II,They heard their fellowship's faint horns; and day
5909,II,"Wore on to noon; yet, there before them, they"
5910,II,"Still saw the hart plunge bravely through the brake,"
5911,II,Leaving the bracken shaking in his wake:
5912,II,"And on they followed; on, through many a copse,"
5913,II,"Above whose brush, close on before, the tops"
5914,II,"Of the great antlers swelled anon, then, lo,"
5915,II,Were gone where beat the heather to and fro.
5916,II,But still they drave him hard; and ever near
5917,II,"Seemed that great hart unwearied, and 'twas clear"
5918,II,"The chase would yet be long, when Arthur's horse"
5919,II,"Gasped mightily and, lunging in his course,"
5920,II,"Lay dead, a lordly bay; and Urience"
5921,II,"Reined his gray hunter, laboring. And thence"
5922,II,King Arthur went afoot. When suddenly
5923,II,"He was aware of a wide waste of sea,"
5924,II,"And, near the wood, the hart upon the sward,"
5925,II,"Bayed, panting unto death and winded hard."
5926,II,So with his sword he slew him; then the pryce
5927,II,Wound loudly on his hunting-bugle thrice.

5932,II,]
5933,II,
5934,II,"As if each echo, which that wild horn's blast"
5935,II,"Roused from its sleep,--the solitude had cast"
5936,II,"For ages on it,--had, a silvery band"
5937,II,"Of moving sounds of gladness, hand in hand"
5938,II,"Arisen,--each a visible delight,--"
5939,II,"Came three fair damsels, sunny in snowy white,"
5940,II,"From the red woodland gliding. They the knight,--"
5941,II,"For so they deemed the King, who came alone,--"
5942,II,"Graced with obeisance. And, ""Our lord,"" said one,"
5943,II,"""Tenders you courtesy until the dawn,"
5944,II,"The Earl, Sir Damas. For the day is gone,"
5945,II,"And you are weary. Safe in his strong keep,"
5946,II,"Led thither with due worship, you shall sleep."""
5947,II,"And so he came, o'erwearied, to a hall,"
5948,II,"An owlet-haunted pile, whose weedy wall"
5949,II,"Towered, rock on rock; its turrets, crowding high,"
5950,II,"Loomed, ancient as the crags, against a sky"
5951,II,"Wherein the moon hung, owl-eyed, round and full:"
5952,II,"An old, gaunt giant-castle, like a gull"
5953,II,"Hung on the weedy cliffs, where broke the dull"
5954,II,"Vast monotone of ocean, that uprolled"
5955,II,"Its windy waters; and where all was old,"
5956,II,"And sad, and swept of winds, and slain of salt,"
5957,II,And haunted grim of ruin: where the vault
5958,II,"Of heav'n bent ever, clamorous as the rout"
5959,II,"Of the defiant headlands, stretching out"
5960,II,"Into the night, with their voluminous shout"
5961,II,"Of wreck and wrath forever. Arthur then,"
5962,II,"Among the gaunt Earl's followers, swarthy men,"
5963,II,"Ate in the wild hall. Then a damsel led,"
5964,II,"With flaring torch, the tired King to bed,"
5965,II,Down lonely labyrinths of that corridored keep.
5966,II,"And soon he rested, sunk in heavy sleep."
5967,II,
5968,II,"Then suddenly he woke; it seemed, 'mid groans"
5969,II,And dolorous sighs: and round him lay the bones
5970,II,"Of many men, and bodies mouldering."
5971,II,And he could hear the wind-swept ocean swing
5972,II,"Its sighing surge above. And so he thought,"
5973,II,"""It is some nightmare weighing me, distraught"
5974,II,"By that long hunt."" And then he sought to shake"
5975,II,The horror off and to himself awake.
5976,II,But still he heard sad groans and whispering sighs:
5977,II,"And gaunt, from iron-ribbéd cells, the eyes"
5978,II,"Of pale, cadaverous knights regarded him,"
5979,II,Unhappy: and he felt his senses swim
5980,II,"With foulness of that dungeon.--""What are ye?"
5981,II,Ghosts? or chained champions? or a company
5982,II,"Of fiends?"" he cried. Then, ""Speak! if speak ye can!"
5983,II,"Speak, in God's name! for I am here--a man!"""
5984,II,"Then groaned the shaggy throat of one who lay,"
5985,II,"A wasted nightmare, dying day by day,"
5986,II,"Yet once a knight of comeliness, and strong"
5987,II,"And great and young, but now, through hunger long,"
5988,II,A skeleton with hollow hands and cheeks:--
5989,II,"""Sir knight,"" said he, ""know that the wretch who speaks"
5990,II,Is only one of twenty knights entombed
5991,II,By Damas here; the Earl who so hath doomed
5992,II,"Us in this dungeon, where starvation lairs;"
5993,II,"Around you lie the bones, whence famine stares,"
5994,II,Of many knights. And would to God that soon
5995,II,My liberated ghost might see the moon
5996,II,"Freed from the horror of this prisonment!"""
5997,II,"With that he sighed, and round the dungeon went"
5998,II,"A rustling sigh, as of the damned; and so"
5999,II,"Another dim, thin voice complained their woe:"
6000,II,"""Know, he doth starve us to obtain this end:"
6001,II,Because not one of us his strength will lend
6002,II,"To battle for what still he calls his rights,"
6003,II,"This castle and its lands. For, of all knights,"
6004,II,He is most base; lacks most in hardihood.
6005,II,"A younger brother, Ontzlake, hath he; good"
6006,II,And courteous; withal most noble; whom
6007,II,"This Damas hates--yea, even seeks his doom;"
6008,II,Denying him to his estate all right
6009,II,Save that he holds by main of arms and might.
6010,II,Through puissance hath Ontzlake some few fields
6011,II,"And one right sumptuous manor, where he deals"
6012,II,"With knights as knights should, with an open hand,"
6013,II,Though ill he can afford it. Through the land
6014,II,He is far-famed for hospitality.
6015,II,"Ontzlake is brave, but Damas cowardly."
6016,II,"For Ontzlake would decide with sword and lance,"
6017,II,"Body to body, this inheritance:"
6018,II,"But Damas, vile as he is courageless,"
6019,II,"Doth on all knights, his guests, lay this duress,"
6020,II,To fight for him or starve. For you must know
6021,II,That in this country he is hated so
6022,II,There is no champion who will take the fight.
6023,II,"Thus fortunes it our plight is such a plight."""
6024,II,"Quoth he and ceased. And, wondering at the tale,"
6025,II,"The King lay silent, while each wasted, pale,"
6026,II,Poor countenance perused him; then he spake:
6027,II,"""And what reward if one this cause should take?""--"
6028,II,"""Deliverance for all if of us one"
6029,II,Consent to be his party's champion.
6030,II,But treachery and he are so close kin
6031,II,We loathe the part as some misshapen sin;
6032,II,And here would rather with the rats find death
6033,II,"Than, serving him, serve wrong, and save our breath,"
6034,II,"And on our heads, perhaps, bring down God's curse."""
6035,II,
6036,II,"""May God deliver you in mercy, sirs,"
6037,II,"And help us all!"" said Arthur. At which word"
6038,II,"Straightway a groaning sound of iron was heard,"
6039,II,"Of chains rushed loose and bolts jarred rusty back,"
6040,II,And hoarse the gate croaked open; and the black
6041,II,"Of that rank cell astonished was with light,"
6042,II,That danced fantastic with the frantic night.
6043,II,"One high torch, sidewise worried by the gust,"
6044,II,"Sunned that dark den of hunger, death and dust;"
6045,II,"And one tall damsel, vaguely vestured, fair,"
6046,II,"With shadowy hair, poised on the rocky stair:"
6047,II,"And laughing on the King, ""What cheer?"" said she."
6048,II,"""God's life! the keep stinks vilely! And to see"
6049,II,"Such noble knights endungeoned, starving here,"
6050,II,"Doth pain me sore with pity. But, what cheer?"""
6051,II,"""Thou mockest us. For me, the sorriest"
6052,II,Since I was suckled; and of any quest
6053,II,This is the most imperiling and strange.--
6054,II,"But what wouldst thou?"" said Arthur. She, ""A change"
6055,II,"I offer thee; through thee to these with thee,"
6056,II,"If thou wilt promise, in love's courtesy,"
6057,II,To fight for Damas and his brotherhood.
6058,II,And if thou wilt not--look! behold this brood
6059,II,"Of lean and dwindled bellies, spectre-eyed,--"
6060,II,"Keen knights once,--who refused me. So decide."""
6061,II,"Then thought the King of the sweet sky, the breeze"
6062,II,That blew delirious over waves and trees;
6063,II,"Thick fields of grasses and the sunny Earth,"
6064,II,"Whose beating heat filled the high heart with mirth,"
6065,II,And made the world one sovereign pleasure-house
6066,II,Where king and serf might revel and carouse:
6067,II,Then of the hunt on autumn-plaintive hills;
6068,II,Lone forest lodges by their radiant rills;
6069,II,"His palace at Caerleon upon Usk,"
6070,II,And Camelot's loud halls that through the dusk
6071,II,"Blazed far and bloomed, a rose of revelry;"
6072,II,"Or, in the misty morning, shadowy"
6073,II,"Loomed, grave with audience. And then he thought"
6074,II,"Of his Round Table, and the Grael wide sought"
6075,II,In haunted holds by many a haunted shore.
6076,II,Then marveled of what wars would rise and roar
6077,II,With dragon heads unconquered and devour
6078,II,This realm of Britain and crush out that flower
6079,II,Of chivalry whence ripened his renown:
6080,II,"And then the reign of some besotted crown,"
6081,II,"Some bandit king of lust, idolatry--"
6082,II,And with that thought for tears he could not see.--
6083,II,"Then of his best-loved champions, King Ban's son,"
6084,II,"And Galahad and Tristram, Accolon:"
6085,II,"And then, ah God! of his loved Guenevere:"
6086,II,And with that thought--to starve 'mid horrors here!--
6087,II,"For, being unfriend to Arthur and his Court,"
6088,II,Well knew he this grim Earl would bless that sport
6089,II,Of fortune which had fortuned him so well
6090,II,"As t' have his King to starve within a cell,"
6091,II,In the entombing rock beside the deep.--
6092,II,"And all the life, large in his limbs, did leap"
6093,II,"Through eager veins and sinews, fierce and red,"
6094,II,Stung on to action; and he rose and said:
6095,II,"""That which thou askest is right hard, but, lo!"
6096,II,"To rot here, harder. I will fight his foe."
6097,II,"But, mark, I have no weapons and no mail;"
6098,II,"No steed against that other to avail."""
6099,II,
6100,II,"She laughed again; ""If we must beg or hire,"
6101,II,"Fear not for that: these thou shalt lack not, sire."""
6102,II,And so she led the way; her torch's fire
6103,II,Sprawling with spidery shadows at each stride
6104,II,The cob-webbed coignes of scowling arches wide.
6105,II,"At length they reached an iron-studded door,"
6106,II,Which she unlocked with one harsh key she bore
6107,II,'Mid many keys bunched at her girdle; thence
6108,II,They issued on a terraced eminence.
6109,II,"Below, the sea broke sounding; and the King"
6110,II,Breathed open air again that had the sting
6111,II,"And scent of brine, the far, blue-billowed foam:"
6112,II,"And in the east the second dawning's gloam,"
6113,II,"Since that unlucky chase, was freaked with streaks"
6114,II,Red as the ripe stripes of an apple's cheeks.
6115,II,"And so, within that larger light of dawn"
6116,II,It seemed to Arthur now that he had known
6117,II,"This maiden at his Court, and so he asked."
6118,II,"But she, well tutored, her real person masked,"
6119,II,"And answered falsely, ""Nay, deceive thee not."
6120,II,"Thou saw'st me ne'er at Arthur's Court, I wot."
6121,II,"For here it likes me best to sing and spin,"
6122,II,"And needle hangings, listening to the din"
6123,II,"Of ocean, sitting some high tower within."
6124,II,"No courts or tournaments or hunts I crave,"
6125,II,"No knights to flatter me! For me--the wave,"
6126,II,"The cliffs, the sea and sky, in calm or storm;"
6127,II,"My garth, wherein I walk at morn; the charm"
6128,II,"Of ocean, redolent at bounteous noon,"
6129,II,And sprayed with sunlight; night's free stars and moon:
6130,II,"White ships that pass, some several every year;"
6131,II,"These ancient towers; and those wild mews to hear."""
6132,II,"""An owlet maid,"" the King laughed.--But untrue"
6133,II,"Was she, and of false Morgane's treasonous crew,"
6134,II,"Deep in intrigues, even for the slaying of"
6135,II,"The King, her brother, whom she did not love.--"
6136,II,"And presently she brought him where, in state,"
6137,II,"This swarthy Damas, 'mid his wildmen sate."
6138,II,
6139,II,*       *       *       *       *
6140,II,
6141,II,"And Accolon, at Castle Chariot still,"
6142,II,"Had lost long weeks in love. Her husband ill,"
6143,II,"Morgane, perforce, must leave her lover here"
6144,II,Among the hills of Gore. A lodge stood near
6145,II,"A cascade in the forest, where their wont"
6146,II,"Was to sit listening the falling fount,"
6147,II,"That, through sweet talks of many idle hours"
6148,II,"On moss-banks, varied with the violet flowers,"
6149,II,"Had learned the lovers' language,--sighed above,--"
6150,II,"And seemed, in every fall, to whisper, ""love"";"
6151,II,"That echoed through the lodge, her hands had draped"
6152,II,With curious hangings; where were worked and shaped
6153,II,"Remembered hours of pleasure, body and soul;"
6154,II,"Imperishable passions, which made whole"
6155,II,The past again in pictures; and could mate
6156,II,The heart with loves long dead; and re-create
6157,II,The very kisses of those perished knights
6158,II,With woven records of long-dead delights.
6159,II,Below the lodge within an urnéd shell
6160,II,"The water pooled, and made a tinkling well,"
6161,II,"Then, slipping thence, through dripping shadows fell"
6162,II,"From rippling rock to rock. Here Accolon,"
6163,II,"With Morgane's hollow lute, as eve drew on"
6164,II,Came all alone: not ev'n her brindled hound
6165,II,To bound before him o'er the gleaming ground;
6166,II,"No handmaid lovely of his loveliest fair,"
6167,II,Or paging dwarf in purple with him there;
6168,II,"Only her lute, about which her perfume"
6169,II,"Clung, odorous of memories, that made bloom"
6170,II,"Her absent features, making them arise,"
6171,II,"Like some rich flower, before his memory's eyes,"
6172,II,That seemed to see her lips and to surmise
6173,II,The words they fashioned; then the smile that drank
6174,II,Her soul's deep fire from eyes wherein it sank
6175,II,"And slowly waned away to deeper dreams,"
6176,II,"Fathomless with thought, down in their dove-gray streams."
6177,II,"And so for her imagined eyes and lips,"
6178,II,"Heart-fashioned features, all the music slips"
6179,II,"Of all his soul, himseems, into his voice,"
6180,II,"To sing her praises. And, with nervous poise,"
6181,II,"His fleet, trained fingers waken in her lute"
6182,II,Such mellow riot as must make envy-mute
6183,II,The nightingale that listens quivering.
6184,II,"And well he hopes that, winging thence, 'twill sing"
6185,II,A similar song;--whose passions burn and pain
6186,II,"Its anguished soul, now silent,--not in vain"
6187,II,"Beneath her casement, in that garden old"
6188,II,Dingled with heavy roses; in the gold
6189,II,Of Camelot's stars and pearl-encrusted moon:
6190,II,And still he hopes the heartache of the tune
6191,II,"Will clamor secret memories in her ear,"
6192,II,"Of life, less dear than death with her not near;"
6193,II,"Of love, who longs for her, to have her here:"
6194,II,Till melt her eyes with tears; and sighs and sobs
6195,II,"O'erwhelm her soul, and separation throbs"
6196,II,"Hard at her heart, that, longing, lifts to death"
6197,II,"A prayerful pleading, crying, ""But a breath,"
6198,II,"One moment of real heaven, there! in his arms!"
6199,II,"Close, close! And, for that moment, then these charms,"
6200,II,"This body, hell, canst have forevermore!"""
6201,II,"And sweet to know, perhaps its song will pour"
6202,II,Into the dull ear of her drowsy lord
6203,II,"A vague suspicion of some secret word,"
6204,II,"Borne by the bird,--love's wingéd messenger,--"
6205,II,"To her who lies beside him; even her,"
6206,II,"His wife, whom still he loves; whom Accolon"
6207,II,Thus sings of where the woods of Gore grow wan:--
6208,II,
6209,II,"""The thought of thy white coming, like a song"
6210,II,"Breathed soft of lovely lips and lute-like tongue,"
6211,II,Sways all my bosom with a sweet unrest;
6212,II,Makes wild my heart that oft thy heart hath pressed.--
6213,II,"Come! press it once again, for it is strong"
6214,II,To bear that weight which never yet distressed.
6215,II,
6216,II,"""O come! and straight the woodland is stormed through"
6217,II,"With wilder wings, and brighter with bright dew:"
6218,II,"And every flow'r, where thy fair feet have passed,"
6219,II,"Puts forth a fairer blossom than the last,"
6220,II,"Thrilled of thine eyes, those arsenals of blue,"
6221,II,Wherein the arrows of all love are cast.
6222,II,
6223,II,"""O Love, she comes! O Love, I feel her breath,"
6224,II,"Like the soft South, that idly wandereth"
6225,II,"Through musical leaves of laughing laziness,"
6226,II,"Page on before her, how sweet,--none can guess:"
6227,II,"Sighing, 'She comes! thy heart's dear life and death;"
6228,II,In whom is all thy bliss and thy distress.'
6229,II,
6230,II,"""She comes! she comes! and all my mind doth rave"
6231,II,For words to tell her how she doth enslave
6232,II,My soul with beauty: then o'erwhelm with love
6233,II,"That loveliness, no words can tell whereof;"
6234,II,"Words, words, like roses, every path to pave,"
6235,II,"Each path to strew, and no word sweet enough!"
6236,II,
6237,II,"""She comes!--Thro' me a passion--as the moon"
6238,II,Works wonder in the sea--through me doth swoon
6239,II,Ungovernable glory; and her soul
6240,II,"Seems blent with mine; and now, to some bright goal,"
6241,II,"Compels me, throbbing like a tender tune,"
6242,II,Exhausting all my efforts of control.
6243,II,
6244,II,"""She comes! ah, God! ye little stars that grace"
6245,II,"The fragmentary skies, and scatter space,"
6246,II,Brighter her steps that golden all my gloom!
6247,II,"Ah, wood-indulging, violet-vague perfume,"
6248,II,"Sweeter the presence of her wild-flower face,"
6249,II,"That fragrance-fills my life, and stars with bloom!"
6250,II,
6251,II,"""Oh, boundless exultation of the blood!"
6252,II,"That now compels me to some higher mood,"
6253,II,Diviner sense of something that outsoars
6254,II,The Earth--her kiss! that all love's splendor pours
6255,II,"Into me; all delicious womanhood,"
6256,II,So all the heart that hesitates--adores.
6257,II,
6258,II,"""Sweet, my soul's victor! heart's triumphant Sweet!"
6259,II,Within thy bosom Love hath raised his seat;
6260,II,"There he sits crowned; and, from thy eyes and hair,"
6261,II,"Shoots his soft arrows,--as the moonbeams fair,--"
6262,II,"That long have laid me supine at thy feet,"
6263,II,And changed my clay to ardent fire and air.
6264,II,
6265,II,"""My love! my witch! whose kiss, like some wild wine,"
6266,II,"Has subtly filled me with a flame divine,"
6267,II,"An aspiration, whose fierce pulses urge"
6268,II,"In all my veins, with rosy surge on surge,"
6269,II,"To hurl me in that heaven, all which is mine,"
6270,II,"Thine arms! from which I never would emerge."""
6271,II,
6272,II,His ecstasy the very foliage shook;
6273,II,"The wood seemed hushed to hear, and hushed the brook;"
6274,II,"And even the heavens, wherein one star shone clear,"
6275,II,"Seemed leaning nearer, his glad song to hear,"
6276,II,"To which its wild star throbbed, all golden-pale:"
6277,II,"And after which, deep in the purple vale,"
6278,II,Awoke the passion of the nightingale.
6279,II,
6280,II,
6281,III,III
6282,III,
6283,III,"As one hath seen a green-gowned huntress fair,"
6284,III,Morn in her cheeks and midnight in her hair;
6285,III,"Keen eyes as gray as rain, young limbs as lithe"
6286,III,As the wild fawn's; and silvery voice as blithe
6287,III,"As is the wind that breathes of flowers and dews,"
6288,III,Breast through the bramble-tangled avenues;
6289,III,"Through brier and thorn, that pluck her gown of green,"
6290,III,"And snag it here and there,--through which the sheen"
6291,III,"Of her white skin gleams rosy;--eyes and face,"
6292,III,"Ardent and flushed, fixed on the lordly chase:"
6293,III,"So came the Evening to that shadowy wood,"
6294,III,"Or so it seemed to Accolon, who stood"
6295,III,Watching the sunset through the solitude.
6296,III,So Evening came; and shadows cowled the way
6297,III,Like ghostly pilgrims who kneel down to pray
6298,III,"Before a wayside shrine: and, radiant-rolled,"
6299,III,"Along the west, the battlemented gold"
6300,III,"Of sunset walled the opal-tinted skies,"
6301,III,That seemed to open gates of Paradise
6302,III,"On soundless hinges of the winds, and blaze"
6303,III,"A glory, far within, of chrysoprase,"
6304,III,Towering in topaz through the purple haze.
6305,III,"And from the sunset, down the roseate ways,"
6306,III,"To Accolon, who, with his idle lute,"
6307,III,Reclined in revery against the root
6308,III,"Of a great oak, a fragment of the west,"
6309,III,"A dwarf, in crimson satin tightly dressed,"
6310,III,"Skipped like a leaf the early frosts have burned,"
6311,III,"A red oak-leaf; and like a leaf he turned,"
6312,III,And danced and rustled. And it seemed he came
6313,III,"From Camelot; from his belovéd dame,"
6314,III,Morgane le Fay. He on his shoulder bore
6315,III,"A mighty blade, wrought strangely o'er and o'er"
6316,III,"With mystic runes, drawn from a scabbard which"
6317,III,"Glared venomous, with angry jewels rich."
6318,III,"He, louting to the knight, ""Sir knight,"" said he,"
6319,III,"""Your Lady, with all tenderest courtesy,"
6320,III,"Assures you--ah, unworthy bearer I"
6321,III,"Of her good message!--of her constancy."""
6322,III,"Then, doffing the great baldric, with the sword,"
6323,III,"To him he gave them, saying, ""From my lord,"
6324,III,"King Arthur: even his Excalibur,"
6325,III,"The magic blade which Merlin gat of her,"
6326,III,"The Ladyé of the Lake, who, as you wot,"
6327,III,"Fostered in infanthood Sir Launcelot,"
6328,III,Upon some isle in Briogne's tangled lands
6329,III,"Of meres and mists; where filmy fairy bands,"
6330,III,"By lazy moons of summer, dancing, fill"
6331,III,With rings of morrice every grassy hill.
6332,III,"Through her fair favor is this weapon sent,"
6333,III,Who begged it of the King with this intent:
6334,III,"That, for her honor, soon would be begun"
6335,III,"A desperate battle with a champion,"
6336,III,"Of wondrous prowess, by Sir Accolon:"
6337,III,"And with the sword, Excalibur, more sure"
6338,III,Were she that he against him would endure.
6339,III,"Magic the blade, and magic, too, the sheath,"
6340,III,"Which, while 'tis worn, wards from the wearer death."""
6341,III,He ceased: and Accolon held up the sword
6342,III,"Excalibur and said, ""It shall go hard"
6343,III,"With him through thee, unconquerable blade,"
6344,III,"Whoe'er he be, who on my Queen hath laid"
6345,III,Insult or injury! And hours as slow
6346,III,As palsied hours in Purgatory go
6347,III,"For those unmassed, till I have slain this foe!--"
6348,III,"Here, page, my purse.--And now, to her who gave,"
6349,III,"Despatch! and say: To all commands, her slave,"
6350,III,"To death obedient, I!--In love or war"
6351,III,Her love to make me all the warrior.--
6352,III,"Bid her have mercy, nor too long delay"
6353,III,"From him, who dies an hourly death each day"
6354,III,"Till, her white hands kissed, he shall kiss her face,"
6355,III,"Through which his life lives on, and still finds grace."""
6356,III,"Thus he commanded. And, incontinent,"
6357,III,"The dwarf departed, like a red shaft sent"
6358,III,Into the sunset's sea of scarlet light
6359,III,Burning through wildwood glooms. And as the night
6360,III,With votaress cypress veiled the dying strife
6361,III,"Sadly of day, and closed his book of life"
6362,III,"And clasped with golden stars, in dreamy thought"
6363,III,"Of what this fight was that must soon be fought,"
6364,III,"Belting the blade about him, Accolon,"
6365,III,Through the dark woods tow'rds Chariot passed on.
6366,III,
6367,III,*       *       *       *       *
6368,III,
6369,III,"And it befell him thus, the following dawn,"
6370,III,"As he was wandering on a dew-drenched lawn,"
6371,III,Glad with the freshness and elastic health
6372,III,"Of sky and earth, that lavished all their wealth"
6373,III,"Of heady winds and racy scents,--a knight"
6374,III,"And gentle lady met him, gay bedight,"
6375,III,With following of six esquires; and they
6376,III,"Held on gloved wrists the hooded falcon gray,"
6377,III,And rode a-hawking o'er the leas of Gore
6378,III,"From Ontzlake's manor, where he languished; sore"
6379,III,"Hurt in the lists, a spear wound in his thigh:"
6380,III,Who had besought--for much he feared to die--
6381,III,"This knight and his fair lady, as they rode"
6382,III,"To hawk near Chariot, Morgane's abode,"
6383,III,That they would beg her in all charity
6384,III,To come to him (for in chirurgery
6385,III,"Of all that land she was the greatest leach),"
6386,III,And her for his recovery beseech.
6387,III,"So, Accolon saluted, they drew rein,"
6388,III,"And spake their message, for, right over fain"
6389,III,"Were they toward their sport,--that he would bear"
6390,III,"Petition to that lady. But, not there"
6391,III,"Was Arthur's sister, as they well must wot;"
6392,III,"But now a sennight lay at Camelot,"
6393,III,The guest of Guenevere; and with her there
6394,III,Four other queens of Farther Britain were:
6395,III,"Isoud of Ireland, she of Cornwall Queen,"
6396,III,"King Mark's wife,--who right rarely then was seen"
6397,III,"At Court for jealousy of Mark, who knew"
6398,III,Her to that lance of Lyonesse how true
6399,III,Since mutual quaffing of a philter; while
6400,III,How guilty Guenevere on such could smile:--
6401,III,She of Northgales and she of Eastland; and
6402,III,"She of the Out Isles Queen. A fairer band,"
6403,III,"For sovereignty and love and loveliness,"
6404,III,Was not in any realm to grace and bless.
6405,III,So Accolon informed them. In distress
6406,III,"Then quoth that knight: ""Ay? see how fortune turns"
6407,III,"And varies like an April day, that burns"
6408,III,"Now welkins blue with calm; now scowls them down,"
6409,III,"Revengeful, with a black storm's wrinkled frown."
6410,III,"For, look! this Damas, who so long hath lain"
6411,III,"A hiding vermin, fearful of all pain,"
6412,III,"Dark in his bandit towers by the deep,"
6413,III,"Wakes from a five years' torpor and a sleep,"
6414,III,"And sends despatch a courier to my lord,"
6415,III,"Sir Ontzlake, with, 'To-morrow, with the sword,"
6416,III,"Earl Damas and his knight, at point of lance,"
6417,III,"Decides the issue of inheritance,"
6418,III,"Body to body, or by champion.'--"
6419,III,Right hard to find such ere to-morrow dawn.
6420,III,"Though sore bestead lies Ontzlake, if he could,"
6421,III,"He would arise and save his livelihood."""
6422,III,
6423,III,"Then thought Sir Accolon: ""One might suppose,"
6424,III,"So soon this follows on her message, those"
6425,III,Same things befall through Morgane's arts--who knows?--
6426,III,"Howe'er it be, as 'twere for her own sake,"
6427,III,"This battle I myself will undertake."""
6428,III,"Then said to those, ""I know the good Ontzlake."
6429,III,"If he be so conditioned, harried of"
6430,III,"Estate and life,--in knighthood and for love"
6431,III,Of justice I his quarrel will assume.
6432,III,My limbs are keen for armor. Let the groom
6433,III,Prepare my steed. Right good 'twill be again
6434,III,"To feel him under me.""--Then, of that train,"
6435,III,"Asked that one gentleman with him remain,"
6436,III,"And men to squire his horse and arms. And then,"
6437,III,"When this was granted, mounted with his men"
6438,III,"And thence departed. And, ere noontide, they"
6439,III,"Came to a lone, dismantled priory"
6440,III,"Hard by a castle 'gainst whose square, grey towers,"
6441,III,"Machicolated, mossed, in forest bowers,"
6442,III,Full many a siege had beat and onset rushed:
6443,III,"A forest fortress, old and deep-imbushed"
6444,III,In wild and woody hills. And then one wound
6445,III,"A hoarse slug-horn, and at the savage sound"
6446,III,"The drawbridge rumbled moatward, clanking, and"
6447,III,Into a paved court rode that little band.
6448,III,
6449,III,*       *       *       *       *
6450,III,
6451,III,"When all the world was morning, gleam and glare"
6452,III,Of autumn glory; and the frost-touched air
6453,III,Rang with the rooks as rings a silver lyre
6454,III,"Swept swift of minstrel fingers, wire on wire;"
6455,III,"Ere that fixed hour of prime, came Arthur, armed"
6456,III,For battle royally. A black steed warmed
6457,III,"A keen impatience 'neath him, cased in mail"
6458,III,Of foreign make; accoutered head and tail
6459,III,"In costly sendal; rearward, wine-dark red,"
6460,III,Amber as sunlight to his fretful head.
6461,III,"Blue armor of linked steel had Arthur on,"
6462,III,"Beneath a robe of honor made of drawn,"
6463,III,"Ribbed satin, diapered and purfled deep"
6464,III,With lordly gold and purple; whence did sweep
6465,III,Two acorn-tufted bangles of fine gold:
6466,III,"And at his thigh a falchion, battle-old"
6467,III,"And triple-edged; its rune-stamped scabbard, of"
6468,III,"Cordovan leather, baldric'd rich above"
6469,III,"With new-cut deer-skin, that, laborious wrought,"
6470,III,"And curiously, with slides of gold was fraught,"
6471,III,"And buckled with a buckle white, that shone,"
6472,III,"Tongued red with gold, and carved of walrus' bone."
6473,III,"And, sapphire-set, a burgonet of gold,--"
6474,III,"Whereon a wyvern sprawled, whose jaws unrolled"
6475,III,"A tongue of garnet agate, of great prize;"
6476,III,"Its orbs of glaring ruby, great in size,--"
6477,III,Incased his head and visor-barred his eyes.
6478,III,"And in his hand a wiry lance of ash,"
6479,III,"Lattened with sapphire silver, like a flash,"
6480,III,"A splinter of sunlight, in the morning's zeal"
6481,III,"Glittered, its point, as 'twere, a star of steel.--"
6482,III,"A squire attended him; a youth, whose head"
6483,III,Waved many a jaunty curl; whereon a red
6484,III,"Cock-feathered cap shone brave: 'neath which, as keen"
6485,III,"As some wild hawk's, his green-gray eyes were seen:"
6486,III,And parti-colored leather shoes he had
6487,III,Upon his feet; his legs were silken clad
6488,III,"In hose of rarest Totness: and a spear,"
6489,III,"Bannered and bronzen, dappled as a deer,"
6490,III,"One hand upheld, like some bright beam of morn;"
6491,III,And round his neck was hung a bugle-horn.
6492,III,"So with his following, while, bar on bar,"
6493,III,"The blue mist lay on woodside and on scar,"
6494,III,"Through mist and dew, through shadow and through ray,"
6495,III,Joustward Earl Damas led the forest way.
6496,III,"Then to King Arthur, when arrived were these"
6497,III,"Where bright the lists shone, bannered, through the trees,"
6498,III,"A wimpled damsel with a falchion came,"
6499,III,"Mounted upon a palfrey, all aflame"
6500,III,"With sweat and heat of hurry; and, ""From her,"
6501,III,"Your sister, Morgane, your Excalibur!"
6502,III,With tender greeting. For you well may need
6503,III,"Its aid in this adventure. So, God speed!"""
6504,III,Said and departed suddenly: nor knew
6505,III,The King that this was not his weapon true:
6506,III,"A brittle forgery, in likeness of"
6507,III,"That blade, of baser metal;--in unlove"
6508,III,"And treason made by her, of all his kin"
6509,III,"The nearest, Morgane; who, her end to win,"
6510,III,"Stopped at no thing; thinking, with Arthur dead,"
6511,III,The crown would grace her own and Accolon's head.
6512,III,"Then, heralded, into the lists he rode."
6513,III,"Opposed flashed Accolon, whose strength bestrode,"
6514,III,"Exultant, strong in talisman of that sword,"
6515,III,"A dun horse lofty as a haughty lord,"
6516,III,"White-pasterned, and of small, impatient hoof:"
6517,III,"Both knight and steed shone armed in mail of proof,"
6518,III,"Of yellow-dappled, variegated plate"
6519,III,Of Spanish laton. And of sovereign state
6520,III,"His surcoat robe of honor,--white and black,"
6521,III,"Of satin, crimson-orphreyed,--at his back"
6522,III,"The wind made billow: and, from forth this robe,"
6523,III,"Excalibur,--a throbbing golden globe"
6524,III,"Of vicious jewels,--thrust its splendid hilt;"
6525,III,"Its broad belt, tawny and with goldwork gilt,"
6526,III,"An eyelid clasped, black, of the black sea-horse,"
6527,III,Tongued red with rosy gold. And pride and force
6528,III,"Sat on his wingéd helmet, plumed, of rich"
6529,III,Bronze-hammered laton; blazing upon which
6530,III,"A hundred brilliants glittered, thick as on"
6531,III,A silver web bright-studding dews of dawn:
6532,III,"Its crest, a taloned griffin, high that ramped;"
6533,III,In whose horned brow one blood-red gem was stamped.
6534,III,"A spear of ash, long-shafted, overlaid"
6535,III,"With azure silver, whereon colors played,"
6536,III,Firm in his iron gauntlet lithely swayed.
6537,III,
6538,III,"Intense on either side the champions stood,"
6539,III,"Shining as serpents that, with spring renewed,"
6540,III,"In gleaming scales, meet on a wild-wood way,"
6541,III,Their angry tongues flickering at poisonous play.
6542,III,"Then clanged a herald's trumpet: and harsh heels,"
6543,III,"Sharp-thrust, each courser felt; the roweled steels"
6544,III,"Spurred forward; and the couched and fiery spears,"
6545,III,"Flashed, as two bolts of storm the tempest steers"
6546,III,"With adverse thunder; and, in middle course,"
6547,III,"Crashed full the unpierced shields, and horse from horse"
6548,III,"Lashed, madly pawing.--And a hoarse roar rang"
6549,III,"From the loud lists, till far the echoes sang"
6550,III,Of hill and rock-hung forest and wild cliff.
6551,III,"Rigid the champions rode where, standing stiff,"
6552,III,Their esquires tendered them the spears they held.
6553,III,"Again the trumpet blew, and, firmly selled,"
6554,III,"Forward they galloped, shield to savage shield,"
6555,III,"And crest to angry crest: the wyvern reeled,"
6556,III,"Towering, against the griffin: scorn and scath"
6557,III,Upon their fiery fronts and in the wrath
6558,III,Of their gem-blazing eyes: each figure stood
6559,III,A symbol of the heart beneath the hood.--
6560,III,"The lance of Accolon, as on a rock"
6561,III,"The storm-launched foam breaks baffled, with the shock,"
6562,III,On Arthur's sounding shield burst splintered force;
6563,III,"But him resistless Arthur's,--high from horse"
6564,III,"Uplifted,--headlong bore, and crashed him down;"
6565,III,A long sword's length unsaddled. Accolon
6566,III,"For one stunned moment lay. Then, rising, drew"
6567,III,The great sword at his hip that shone like dew
6568,III,"Smitten with morn. ""Descend!"" he grimly said,"
6569,III,"""To proof of better weapons, head to head!"
6570,III,"Enough of spears! to swords!""--And from his height"
6571,III,"The King clanged down. And quick, like some swift light,"
6572,III,"His moon-bright brand unsheathed. And, hollowed high,"
6573,III,"Each covering shield gleamed, slantwise, to'ards the sky,"
6574,III,"A blazoned eye of bronze: and underneath,"
6575,III,"As 'neath two clouds, the lightning and the death"
6576,III,Of the fierce swords played. Now a shield descends--
6577,III,"A long blade leaps;--and now, a fang that rends,"
6578,III,"Another blade, loud as a battle word,"
6579,III,"Beats downward, trenchant; and, resounding heard,"
6580,III,A shield's fierce face replies: again a sword
6581,III,"Swings for a giant blow, and, balked again,"
6582,III,"Burns crashing from a sword. Thus, o'er the plain,"
6583,III,"Over and over, blade on baleful blade;"
6584,III,"Teeth clenched; and eyes, behind their visors' shade,"
6585,III,"Like wild beasts' eyes in caverns; shield to shield,"
6586,III,"The champions strove, each scorning still to yield."
6587,III,
6588,III,Then Arthur drew aside to rest upon
6589,III,"His falchion for a space. But Accolon,"
6590,III,"As yet,--through virtue of that magic sheath,--"
6591,III,"Fresh and almighty, and no nearer death"
6592,III,"Now than when first the fight to death begun,"
6593,III,"Chafed at delay. But Arthur, with the sun,"
6594,III,"His heavy mail, his wounds, and loss of blood,"
6595,III,"Made weary, ceased and for a moment stood"
6596,III,"Leaning upon his sword. Then, ""Dost thou tire?"""
6597,III,"Sneered Accolon. And then, with fiercer fire,"
6598,III,"""Defend thee! yield thee! or die recreant!"""
6599,III,"And at the King aimed a wild blow, aslant,"
6600,III,That beat a flying fire from the steel.
6601,III,"Stunned by that blow, the King, with brain a-reel,"
6602,III,"Sank on one knee; then rose, infuriate,"
6603,III,Nerved with new vigor; and with heat and hate
6604,III,"Gnarled all his strength into one blow of might,"
6605,III,"And in both fists his huge blade knotted tight,"
6606,III,"And swung, terrific, for a final stroke,--"
6607,III,"And,--as the lightning flames upon an oak,--"
6608,III,Boomed on the burgonet his foeman wore;
6609,III,"Hacked through and through its crest, and cleanly shore,"
6610,III,"With hollow clamor, from his head and ears,"
6611,III,The brag and boasting of that griffin fierce:
6612,III,"Then, in an instant, as if made of glass,"
6613,III,"That brittle blade burst, shattered; and the grass"
6614,III,"Shone, strewn with shards; as 'twere a broken ray,"
6615,III,It fell and bright in feverish fragments lay.
6616,III,"Then groaned the King, disarmed. And straight he knew"
6617,III,This sword was not Excalibur: too true
6618,III,"And perfect tempered, runed and mystical,"
6619,III,"That weapon of old wars! and then withal,"
6620,III,"Looking upon his foe, who still with stress"
6621,III,"Fought on, untiring, and with no distress"
6622,III,"Of wounds or heat, he thought, ""I am betrayed!"""
6623,III,"Then as the sunlight struck along that blade,"
6624,III,"He knew it, by the hilt, for his own brand,"
6625,III,"The true Excalibur, that high in hand"
6626,III,Now rose avenging. For Sir Accolon
6627,III,In madness urged th' unequal battle on
6628,III,"His King defenseless; who, the hilted cross"
6629,III,"Of that false weapon grasped, beneath the boss"
6630,III,"Of his deep-dented shield crouched; and around,"
6631,III,"Like some great beetle, labored o'er the ground,"
6632,III,Whereon the shards of shattered spears and bits
6633,III,Of shivered steel and gold made sombre fits
6634,III,"Of flame, 'mid which, hard-pressed and cowering"
6635,III,"Beneath his shield's defense, the dauntless King"
6636,III,"Crawled still defiant. And, devising still"
6637,III,"How to secure his sword and by what skill,"
6638,III,Him thus it fortuned when most desperate:
6639,III,"In that close chase they came where, shattered late,"
6640,III,"Lay, tossed, the truncheon of a bursten lance,"
6641,III,"Which, deftly seized, to Accolon's advance"
6642,III,He wielded with effect. Against the fist
6643,III,"Smote, where the gauntlet clasped the nervous wrist,"
6644,III,That heaved Excalibur for one last blow;
6645,III,Sudden the palsied sinews of his foe
6646,III,"Relaxed in effort, and, the great sword seized,"
6647,III,Was wrenched away: and straight the wroth King eased
6648,III,"Himself of his huge shield, and hurled it far;"
6649,III,And clasping in both arms of wiry war
6650,III,"His foe, Sir Accolon,--as one hath seen"
6651,III,"A strong wind take an ash tree, rocking green,"
6652,III,"And swing its sappy bulk, then, trunk and boughs,"
6653,III,Crash down its thundering height in wild carouse
6654,III,"And wrath of tempest,--so King Arthur shook"
6655,III,"And headlong flung Sir Accolon. Then took,"
6656,III,"Tearing away, that scabbard from his side"
6657,III,"And hurled it through the lists, that far and wide"
6658,III,"Gulped in the battle breathless. Then, still wroth,"
6659,III,He seized Excalibur; and grasped of both
6660,III,"Wild hands, swung trenchant, and brought glittering down"
6661,III,"On rising Accolon. Steel, bone and brawn"
6662,III,That blow hewed through. Unsettled every sense.
6663,III,"Bathed in a world of blood, his limbs lay tense"
6664,III,"A moment, then grew limp, relaxed in death."
6665,III,"And bending o'er him, from the brow beneath,"
6666,III,"The King unlaced the helm. When dark, uncasqued,"
6667,III,"The knight's slow eyelids opened, Arthur asked:"
6668,III,"""Say, ere thou diest, whence and who thou art!"
6669,III,"What king, what court is thine? And from what part"
6670,III,"Of Britain dost thou come? Speak!--for, methinks,"
6671,III,I have beheld thee--where? Some memory links
6672,III,"Me strangely with thy face, thy eyes ... thou art--"
6673,III,"Who art thou?--speak!""--"
6674,III,
6675,III,"He answered, slow, then short,"
6676,III,"With labored breathing: ""I?--one, Accolon,--"
6677,III,Of Gaul--a knight of Arthur's court--anon--
6678,III,"But to what end--yea, tell me--am I slain?""--"
6679,III,Then bent King Arthur nearer and again
6680,III,"Drew back: then, anguish in his utterance, sighed:"
6681,III,"""One of my Table!""--Then asked softly, ""Say,"
6682,III,"Whence hadst thou this, my sword? say, in what way"
6683,III,"Thou cam'st by it?""--But, wandering, that knight"
6684,III,"Heard with dull ears, divining but by sight"
6685,III,"The question asked; and answered, ""Woe!--the sword!--"
6686,III,Woe worth the sword!--Lean down!--Canst hear my word?--
6687,III,"From Morgane! Arthur's sister, who had made"
6688,III,"Me king of all this kingdom, so she said--"
6689,III,"Hadst thou not 'risen, accurséd, like a fate,"
6690,III,"To make our schemes miscarry!--Wait! nay, wait!--"
6691,III,"A king! dost hear?--a gold and blood-crowned king,"
6692,III,"I!--Arthur's sister, queen!--No bird can wing"
6693,III,Higher than her ambition! that resolved
6694,III,"Her brother's death was needed, and evolved"
6695,III,"Plots that should ripen with the ripening year,"
6696,III,"And here be reaped, perhaps--nay, nay! not here!--"
6697,III,"Farewell, my Morgane!--Yea, 'twas she who schemed"
6698,III,While there at Chariot we loved and dreamed
6699,III,Gone some six months.--There nothing gave us care.
6700,III,Each morning was a liberal almoner
6701,III,Prodigal of silver to the earth and air:
6702,III,"Each eve, a fiery dragon, cloud-enrolled,"
6703,III,"Convulsive, dying overwhelmed with gold;"
6704,III,"On such an eve it was, that, redolent,"
6705,III,"She sat by me and said,--'My message sent,"
6706,III,"Some night--within the forest--thou, my knight!"
6707,III,Thou and the king!--my men--the forest fight!--
6708,III,"Murder perhaps.--But, well?--who is to blame?'..."
6709,III,So with her blood-red thoughts to me she came.
6710,III,"To me! that woman, brighter than a flame,"
6711,III,"And wooed my soul to hell, with love accurs'd;"
6712,III,"With harlot lips, from which my being first"
6713,III,"Drank hell and heaven. She, who was in sooth"
6714,III,"My heaven and hell.--But now, behind her youth"
6715,III,She shrivels to a hag!--I see the truth!--
6716,III,"Harlot!--nay, spouse of Urience, King of Gore!--"
6717,III,"Wanton!--nay, witch! sweet witch!--what wouldst thou more?--"
6718,III,Hast thou not had thy dream? and wilt thou grieve
6719,III,That death so ruins it?--Thou dost perceive
6720,III,"How I still love thee! witness bear this field,"
6721,III,This field and he to whom I would not yield!--
6722,III,"Would thou wert here to kiss me ere I die!""--"
6723,III,
6724,III,Then anger in the good King's gloomy eye
6725,III,"Glowed, instant-embered, as one oft may see"
6726,III,"A star blaze up in heaven, then cease to be."
6727,III,"Slow from his visage he his visor raised,"
6728,III,And on the dying knight a moment gazed;
6729,III,"Then grimly said, ""Look on me, Accolon!"
6730,III,"I am thy King!"" He, with an awful groan,"
6731,III,"Blade-battered as he was, beheld and knew;"
6732,III,"Strained to his tottering knees; and, gasping, drew"
6733,III,"Up full his armored height and hoarsely cried,"
6734,III,"""The King!"" and at his mailed feet crashed and died."
6735,III,
6736,III,"Then came a world of anxious faces, pressed"
6737,III,"About King Arthur; who, though sore distressed,"
6738,III,"Bespake that multitude: ""While breath and power"
6739,III,"Remain, judge we these brothers: This hard hour"
6740,III,Hath given to Damas all this rich estate:
6741,III,So it is his; allotted his by fate
6742,III,And force of arms. So let it be to him.
6743,III,"For, stood our oath on knighthood not so slim"
6744,III,But that it hath this strong conclusiön.
6745,III,This much by us as errant knight is done.--
6746,III,"Now our decree, as King of Britain, hear:"
6747,III,We do command Earl Damas to appear
6748,III,"No more upon our shores, or any isles"
6749,III,Of farthest Britain in its many miles.
6750,III,"One week be his, no more! then will we come,"
6751,III,"Even with an iron host, to seal his doom:"
6752,III,"If he be not departed overseas,"
6753,III,"With all his men and all his outlawries,"
6754,III,"From his own towers, around which sea-birds clang,"
6755,III,Alive and naked shall he starve and hang
6756,III,And rot! vile food for kites and carrion crows.
6757,III,Thus much for him!... But all our favor goes
6758,III,"Toward Sir Ontzlake, whom it likes the King"
6759,III,To take into his knightly following
6760,III,Of the Round Table. Bear to him our word.
6761,III,But I am over weary. Take my sword.--
6762,III,"Unharness me, for more and more I tire;"
6763,III,And all my wounds are so much aching fire.
6764,III,Yea; help me hence. To-morrow I would fain
6765,III,"To Glastonbury and with me the slain."""
6766,III,"So bore they then the wounded King away,"
6767,III,"The dead behind, as closed the autumn day."
6768,III,
6769,III,*       *       *       *       *
6770,III,
6771,III,"But when, within that abbey, he waxed strong,"
6772,III,"The King, remembering the marauder wrong"
6773,III,"Which Damas had inflicted on that land,"
6774,III,"Commanded Lionell, with a stanch band,"
6775,III,To stamp this weed out if still rooted there.
6776,III,"He, riding thither to that robber lair,"
6777,III,"Led Arthur's hopefulest helms, when, thorn on thorn,"
6778,III,Reddened an hundred spears one winter morn:
6779,III,"And found--a ruin of fire-blackened rock,"
6780,III,"Of tottering towers, that shook to every shock"
6781,III,Of the wild waves; and loomed above the bents
6782,III,"Turrets and cloudy-clustered battlements,"
6783,III,Wailing with wind that swept those clamorous lands:
6784,III,"Above the foam, that climbed with haling hands,"
6785,III,Desolate and gaunt; reflected in the flats;
6786,III,"Hollow and huge, the haunt of owls and bats."
6787,III,
6788,III,
6789,IV,IV
6790,IV,
6791,IV,"Hate, born of Wrath and mother red of Crime,"
6792,IV,"In Hell was whelped ere the hot hands of Time,"
6793,IV,"Artificer of God, had coined our world"
6794,IV,"Within the formless void, and round it furled"
6795,IV,"Its lordly raiment of the day and night,"
6796,IV,And germed its womb with beauty and delight:
6797,IV,"And Hell sent Hate to Earth, that it might use"
6798,IV,"And serve Hell's ends, filling with flame its cruse...."
6799,IV,
6800,IV,For her half-brother Morgane had conceived
6801,IV,"Unnatural hatred; so much so, she grieved,"
6802,IV,"Envious and jealous, for the high renown"
6803,IV,And might the King had gathered round his crown
6804,IV,"Through truth and honor. And who was it said,"
6805,IV,"""Those nearest to the crown are those to dread""?--"
6806,IV,"Warm in your breast a serpent, it will sting"
6807,IV,The breast that warms it: and albeit the King
6808,IV,"Knew of his sister's hate, he passed it by,"
6809,IV,Thinking that love and kindness gradually
6810,IV,Would win her heart to him. He little knew
6811,IV,"The witch he dealt with, beautiful to view,"
6812,IV,And all the poison she could stoop to brew.
6813,IV,"She, who, well knowing how much mightier"
6814,IV,"The King than Accolon, rejoiced that her"
6815,IV,"Wits had secured from him Excalibur,"
6816,IV,"Without which, she was certain, in the joust"
6817,IV,The King were as a foe unarmed. Her trust
6818,IV,"Smiled, confident of conclusion: eloquent,"
6819,IV,"Within her, whispered of success, that lent"
6820,IV,Her heart a lofty hope; and at large eyes
6821,IV,Piled up imperial dreams of power and prize.
6822,IV,"And in her carven chamber, oaken-dark,"
6823,IV,"Traceried and arrased,--when the barren park"
6824,IV,"Dripped, drenched with autumn,--for November lay"
6825,IV,"Swathed frostily in fog on every spray,--"
6826,IV,"She at her tri-arched casement sate one night,"
6827,IV,Ere yet came courier from that test of might.
6828,IV,Her lord in slumber and the castle full
6829,IV,Of drowsy silence and the rain's dull lull:
6830,IV,"""The King removed?--my soul!--he _is_ removed!"
6831,IV,Ere now dog-dead he lies. His sword hath proved
6832,IV,"Too much for him. Yet! let him lie in state,"
6833,IV,"The great king, Arthur!--But, regenerate,"
6834,IV,"Now crown our other monarch, Accolon!"
6835,IV,"And, with him, Love, the ermined! balmy son"
6836,IV,"Of gods, not men; and nobler hence to rule."
6837,IV,"Love, Love almighty; beautiful to school"
6838,IV,The hearts and souls of mortals!--Then this realm's
6839,IV,"Iron-huskéd flower of war,--that overwhelms"
6840,IV,"The world with havoc,--will explode and bloom"
6841,IV,"The amaranth, peace, with love for its perfume."
6842,IV,"And then, O Launcelots and Tristrams, vowed"
6843,IV,"To Gueneveres and Isouds,--now allowed"
6844,IV,"No pleasure but what hour by stolen hour,"
6845,IV,"In secret places, brings to flaming flower,--"
6846,IV,You shall have feasts of passion evermore!
6847,IV,"And out-thrust Love, now shivering at the door,"
6848,IV,"No more shalt stand neglected and cast off,"
6849,IV,Insulted and derided; and the scoff
6850,IV,"Of War, the bully, whose hands of insult fling"
6851,IV,"Off, for the iron of arms, thy hands that cling"
6852,IV,"About his brutal feet, that crush thy face,"
6853,IV,"Bleeding, into the dust.--Here, in War's place,"
6854,IV,We will erect a shrine of sacrifice;
6855,IV,Love's sacrifice; a shrine of purest price;
6856,IV,Where each shall lay his heart and each his soul
6857,IV,"For Love, for earthly Love! who shall control"
6858,IV,"The world, and make it as the Heaven whole;"
6859,IV,"Being to it its stars and moon and sun,"
6860,IV,Its firmament and all its lights in one.
6861,IV,"And if by such Love Heaven should be debarred,"
6862,IV,"Its God, its spheres, with spiritual love in-starred,"
6863,IV,"Hell will be Heaven, our Heaven, while Love shall thus"
6864,IV,"Remain earth Love, that God encouraged in us."
6865,IV,
6866,IV,"""And now for Urience, my gaunt old lord!--"
6867,IV,"There lies my worry.--Yet, hath he no sword"
6868,IV,"No dangerous dagger I, hid softly here,"
6869,IV,Sharp as an adder's fang? or for his ear
6870,IV,No instant poison to insinuate
6871,IV,"Ice in his pulses, and with death abate?"""
6872,IV,So did she then determine; on that night
6873,IV,"Of lonely autumn, when no haggard, white,"
6874,IV,"Wan, watery moon dreamed on the streaming pane;"
6875,IV,"But, on the leads, beat the incessant rain,"
6876,IV,And the lamenting wind wailed wild among
6877,IV,"The trees and turrets, like a phantom throng."
6878,IV,So grew her face severe as skies that take
6879,IV,Suggestions of far storm whose thunders shake
6880,IV,"The distant hills with wrath, and cleave with fire"
6881,IV,A pine the moaning forest mourns as sire--
6882,IV,So touched her countenance that dark intent:
6883,IV,"And in still eyes her thoughts were evident,"
6884,IV,"As in dark waters, luminous and deep,"
6885,IV,The heavens glass themselves when o'er them sweep
6886,IV,"The clouds of storm and austere stars they keep,--"
6887,IV,"Ghostly and gray,--locked in their steadfast gloom."
6888,IV,"Then, as if some great wind had swept the room,"
6889,IV,"Silent, intense, she rose up from her seat."
6890,IV,"As if dim arms had made her a retreat,"
6891,IV,"Secret as thought to move in, like a ghost,"
6892,IV,"Noiseless as sleep and subtle as the frost,"
6893,IV,"Poised like a light and borne as carefully,"
6894,IV,She trod the gusty hall where shadowy
6895,IV,The hangings rolled a dim Pendragon war.
6896,IV,"And there the mail of Urience shone. A star,"
6897,IV,"Glimmering above, a dying cresset dropped"
6898,IV,"From the stone vault and flared. And here she stopped,"
6899,IV,"And took the sword, fresh-burnished by his page,"
6900,IV,"Long as a flame of pale, arrested rage.--"
6901,IV,"For she had thought that, when they found him dead,"
6902,IV,His sword laid by him on the bloody bed
6903,IV,Would be convictive that his own hand had
6904,IV,Done him this violence when fever-mad.
6905,IV,"The sword she took; and to the chamber, where"
6906,IV,"King Urience slept, she glided; like an air,"
6907,IV,Smooth in seductive sendal; or a fit
6908,IV,"Of faery song, a wicked charm in it,"
6909,IV,That slays; an incantation full of guile.
6910,IV,She paused upon his threshold; for a while
6911,IV,"Listened; and, sure he slept, stole in and stood"
6912,IV,Crouched o'er his couch. About her heart the blood
6913,IV,"Caught, strangling; then rose throbbing, thud on thud,"
6914,IV,"Up to her wide-stretched eyes, and up and up,"
6915,IV,"As wine might, whirling wildly in a cup."
6916,IV,"Then came rare Recollection, with a mouth"
6917,IV,Sweet as the honeyed sunbeams of the South
6918,IV,Trickling through perplexed ripples of the leaves;
6919,IV,To whose faint form a veil of starshine cleaves
6920,IV,Intricate gauze from memoried eyes to feet--
6921,IV,Feet softer than the sifted snows and fleet
6922,IV,To come and go and airy anxiously.
6923,IV,"She, trembling to her, like a flower a bee"
6924,IV,"Nests in and makes an audible mouth of musk,"
6925,IV,"Lisping a downy message to the dusk,"
6926,IV,Laid lips to ears and languaged memories of
6927,IV,Now hateful Urience:--How her maiden love
6928,IV,"Had left Caerleon secretly for Gore,"
6929,IV,"With him, one day of autumn. How a boar,"
6930,IV,"Wild as the wildness of the solitude,"
6931,IV,"Raged at her from a cavern of the wood,"
6932,IV,"That, crimson-creepered, yawned the bristling curse"
6933,IV,Murderous upon her. As her steed grew worse
6934,IV,"And, terrified, fled snorting down the dell,"
6935,IV,"How she had flung herself from out the selle,"
6936,IV,"In fear, upon a bank of springy moss,"
6937,IV,Where she lay swooning: in an utter loss
6938,IV,"Of mind and limbs; wherein she seemed to see,"
6939,IV,"Or saw in horror, half unconsciously,--"
6940,IV,As one who pants beneath an incubus
6941,IV,"And strives to shriek or move, delirious,--"
6942,IV,"The monster-thing thrust tow'rds her, tusked and fanged,"
6943,IV,And hideous snouted: how the whole wood clanged
6944,IV,And buzzed and boomed a hundred sounds and lights
6945,IV,"Lawless about her brain,--like leaves wild nights"
6946,IV,"Of hurricane harvest, shouting.--Then it seemed"
6947,IV,A fury thundered 'twixt them--and she screamed
6948,IV,As round her flew th' uprooted loam that held
6949,IV,"Leaves, twigs and matted moss; and, clanging, swelled"
6950,IV,"Continual echoes with the thud of strife,"
6951,IV,And groan of man and brute that warred for life:
6952,IV,"How all the air, gone mad with foam and forms,"
6953,IV,"Spun froth and, 'twixt her, wrestled hair and arms,"
6954,IV,"And hoofs and feet that crushed the leaves and shred,"
6955,IV,"Whirling them wildly, brown, and yellow, and red."
6956,IV,"And how she rose and leaned her throbbing head,"
6957,IV,With all its uncoifed braids of raven hair
6958,IV,"Disheveled, on one arm,--as white and fair"
6959,IV,"And smooth as milk,--and saw, as through a haze,"
6960,IV,The brute thing throttled and the frowning face
6961,IV,"Of Urience bent above it, browed with might;"
6962,IV,"One red swol'n arm, that pinned the hairy fright,"
6963,IV,"Strong as a god's, iron at the gullet's brawn:"
6964,IV,"Dug in its midriff, the close knees, updrawn,"
6965,IV,"Wedged, as with steel, the glutton sides that strove,--"
6966,IV,"A shaggy bulk,--with hoofs that drove and drove."
6967,IV,And then she saw how Urience swiftly slipped
6968,IV,"One arm, the monster's tearing tusks had ripped"
6969,IV,"And ribboned redly, to the dagger's hilt,--"
6970,IV,"Which at his hip hung long, its haft gold-gilt;--"
6971,IV,"Flame-like it flashed; and then, as bright as ice,"
6972,IV,"Plunged, and replunged; again, now twice, now thrice;"
6973,IV,"And the huge boar, stretched out in sullen death,"
6974,IV,"Lay, bubbling blood, with harsh, laborious breath."
6975,IV,"Then how he brought her water from a well,"
6976,IV,That rustled freshly near them as it fell
6977,IV,"From its full-mantled urn, in his deep casque,"
6978,IV,"And begged her drink; then bathed her brow, a task"
6979,IV,That had accompanying tears of joy and vows
6980,IV,"Of love, and intercourse of eyes and brows,"
6981,IV,"And many kisses: then, beneath the boughs,"
6982,IV,"His wound dressed, and her steed still violent"
6983,IV,"From fear, she mounted and behind him bent"
6984,IV,And clasped him on the same steed; and they went
6985,IV,"On through the gold wood tow'rds the golden west,"
6986,IV,"Till, on one low hill's forest-covered crest,"
6987,IV,"Gray from the gold, his castle's battlements pressed."
6988,IV,And then she felt she'd loved him till had come
6989,IV,"Fame of the love of Isoud, whom, from home,"
6990,IV,Tristram had brought across the Irish foam;
6991,IV,And Guenevere's for Launcelot of the Lake:
6992,IV,Then how her thought from these did seem to take
6993,IV,Reflex of longing; and within her wake
6994,IV,Desire for some great lover who should slake;
6995,IV,And such found Accolon.
6996,IV,
6997,IV,And then she thought
6998,IV,"How far she'd fallen, and how darkly fraught"
6999,IV,With consequence was this. Then what distress
7000,IV,Were hers and his--her lover's--and success
7001,IV,"How doubly difficult if, Arthur slain,"
7002,IV,King Urience lived to assert his right to reign.
7003,IV,So she stood pondering with the sword; her lips
7004,IV,"Breathless, and tight as were her finger-tips"
7005,IV,"About the weapon's hilt. And so she sighed,"
7006,IV,"""Nay, nay! too long hast lived who shouldst have died"
7007,IV,"Even in the womb, my sorrow! who for years"
7008,IV,"Hast leashed my life to thine, a bond of tears,"
7009,IV,"A weight of care, a knot that thus I part!"
7010,IV,Thus harshly sever! Ugly that thou art
7011,IV,"Into the elements naked!"""
7012,IV,
7013,IV,O'er his heart
7014,IV,The long blade paused and--then descended hard.
7015,IV,"Unfleshed, she flung it by her murdered lord,"
7016,IV,"And watched the blood spread darkly through the sheet,"
7017,IV,"And drip, a horror, at impassive feet"
7018,IV,Pooling the polished oak. Regretless she
7019,IV,"Stood, and relentless; in her ecstasy"
7020,IV,"A lovely devil: demon crowned, that cried"
7021,IV,"For Accolon, with passion that defied"
7022,IV,Control in all her senses; clamorous as
7023,IV,A torrent in a cavernous mountain pass
7024,IV,That sweeps to wreck and ruin; at that hour
7025,IV,So swept her longing tow'rds her paramour.
7026,IV,"Him whom, King Arthur had commanded when"
7027,IV,"Borne from the lists, she should receive again;"
7028,IV,"Her lover, her dear Accolon, as was just,"
7029,IV,As was but due her for her love--and lust.
7030,IV,And while she stood revolving if her deed's
7031,IV,"Secret were safe, behold! a noise of steeds,"
7032,IV,"Arms, jingling stirrups, voices loud that cursed"
7033,IV,"Fierce in the northern court. To her, athirst"
7034,IV,"For him her lover, war and power it spoke,"
7035,IV,Him victor and so king. And then awoke
7036,IV,"Desire to see and greet him: and she fled,"
7037,IV,"Like some wild spectre, down the stairs; and, red,"
7038,IV,"Burst on a glare of links and glittering mail,"
7039,IV,That shrunk her eyes and made her senses quail.
7040,IV,"To her a bulk of iron, bearded fierce,"
7041,IV,"Down from a steaming steed into her ears,"
7042,IV,"""This from the King, O Queen!"" laughed harsh and hoarse:"
7043,IV,"Two henchmen beckoned, who pitched sheer, with force,"
7044,IV,"Loud clanging at her feet, hacked, hewn, and red,"
7045,IV,"Crusted with blood, a knight in armor--dead:"
7046,IV,"Her Accolon, flung in his battered arms"
7047,IV,"By what to her seemed fiends and demon forms,"
7048,IV,"Wild-torched, who mocked; then, with the parting scoff,"
7049,IV,"""This from the King!"" phantoms in fog, rode off."
7050,IV,
7051,IV,*       *       *       *       *
7052,IV,
7053,IV,And what remains?--From Camelot to Gore
7054,IV,"That night she, wailing, fled; thence, to the shore,--"
7055,IV,"As old romances tell,--of Avalon;"
7056,IV,Where she hath majesty gold-crowned and wan:
7057,IV,"Clothed dark in cypress, still her lovely face"
7058,IV,"Is young and queenly; sweeter though in grace,"
7059,IV,And softer for the sorrow there; the trace
7060,IV,"Of immemorial tears as for some crime,"
7061,IV,"Attempted or committed at some time,"
7062,IV,"Some old, unhappy time of long ago,"
7063,IV,That haunts her eyes and fills them with its woe:
7064,IV,"Sad eyes, dark, future-fixed, expectant of"
7065,IV,"That far-off hour awaited of her love,"
7066,IV,When the forgiving Arthur cometh and
7067,IV,"Shall rule, dim King, o'er all that golden land,"
7068,IV,"That Isle of Avalon, where none grows old,"
7069,IV,"Where spring is ever, and never a wind blows cold;"
7070,IV,That lifts its mountains from forgotten seas
7071,IV,Of surgeless turquoise deep with mysteries.--
7072,IV,"And so was seen Morgana nevermore,"
7073,IV,"Save once, when from the Cornwall coast she bore"
7074,IV,The wounded Arthur from that last fought fight
7075,IV,Of Camlan in a black barge into night.
7076,IV,"But some may see her, with a palfried band"
7077,IV,"Of serge-stoled maidens, through the drowsy land"
7078,IV,"Of autumn glimmer,--when are sadly strewn"
7079,IV,"The red leaves, and, broad in the east, the moon"
7080,IV,"Hangs, full of frost, a lustrous globe of gleams,--"
7081,IV,Faint on the mooning hills as shapes in dreams.

7091,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Of old Caerleon, rolling down, it seemed,--"
7092,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Incarnadined with splendor of the west,--"
7093,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The heathen blood of all of Arthur's wars.
7094,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",So she had left him; and he stood alone
7095,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Within the carven casement, where a ray"
7096,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of sunset laid a bleeding spear athwart
7097,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The dark oak hall, and, on the arras gaunt"

7103,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Forget her! and her game of shuttlecock,"
7104,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Of battledore and shuttlecock with his heart,"
7105,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",This Angharad! this child the Court had spoiled!

7107,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Spurring his piebald stallion down the square,"
7108,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Upon the King's quest, and a girl had laughed"
7109,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",From some be-dragoned balcony of walls
7110,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",That faced the gateway; and in passing he
7111,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Had glimpsed her beauty. It was she. And then
7112,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","He thought how she had haunted him for days,"
7113,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","For weeks; and how, returning to Caerleon,"
7114,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","His long quest ended, how it thus befell:"
7115,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Deep snow had fallen and the winter wood
7116,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Lay carpeted with silence. And he rode
7117,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Into a vista where a raven lay
7118,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Slain of a hawk; some blood-drops dyed the snow.
7119,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",He lost himself in quaint comparisons
7120,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of how the sifted drift was as her skin;
7121,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The raven's feathers as her heavy hair;
7122,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And in her cheeks the health of maidenhood
7123,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Red as the blood-drops. So he sat and dreamed:
7124,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",When one rode up in angry steel and spoke
7125,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Thrice to no answer, and in anger dashed"
7126,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A gauntlet in his face and made at him:
7127,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And how he slew him and rode over him,"
7128,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Fiercer than fire; then how he returned
7129,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","To find her fairer than their Gwenddolen,--"
7130,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Who, ere the coming of this loveliness,"
7131,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Divided all men's hearts with Gwenhwyvar:--
7132,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Crowned beauty of the beautiful at Court,"
7133,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","With Gwenhwyvar, and fair among the fair."
7134,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7135,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Thus while he mused he thought he heard her voice:
7136,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Or was it fancy? teasing him with sounds
7137,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of music and of words: or did he hear
7138,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Her lute below the creepered walls? whose leaves,"
7139,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Crimson with autumn, reddened all the court,"
7140,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Burning continual sunset, where she sat"
7141,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Beside the ceaseless whisper of the foam
7142,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of one faint fountain. Sweeter mockery
7143,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Had never held him: and he heard her sing:--
7144,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7145,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Ask me not now to sing to thee"
7146,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Songs I have loved to sing before.

7178,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Thou dost not heed, thou wilt not hear it sing."
7179,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Or, if thou dost, 'tis but in wantonness,"
7180,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Indifference pretending interest: then praise,"
7181,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","A moiety, in mockery. And this"
7182,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","To one who'd love thee over all belief,"
7183,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Above all women and beyond all men."""
7184,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7185,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","She strummed her lute. He listened, and then laughed,"
7186,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""God's life! our Dagonet might teach me sense,"
7187,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The folly that I am!--What? have I slept
7188,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","A sennight in the taking of the moon,"
7189,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Or danced, sleep-footed, with the forest fays?--"
7190,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","One would imagine.... No!... O silken Lust,"
7191,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","O Wantonness! whose soft, voluptuous skirts"
7192,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Trail sweet contamination through these halls!
7193,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","O lawless Love, whose evil influence"
7194,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Haunts and parades Caerleon corridors!
7195,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","O Vanity and Falsehood, throned within"
7196,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The faithless Court, here is another soul,"
7197,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Fresh, fragrant, like a wild-flower of the woods,"
7198,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Ready and willing to be plucked and worn,"
7199,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And placed among those soiled and hothouse flowers,"
7200,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","You long have worn, Isolt and Gwenhwyvar!"
7201,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The forest flower, innocent as yet,--"
7202,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The fairest, hence the more to be desired,"
7203,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The quickest, too, to wither,--whose sweet name"
7204,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Is Angharad!... Ho! page! my horse! my mail!--
7205,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","God's wounds! my horse! my arms!--I will away!"""
7206,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7207,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And many knights he passed, nor saw; who asked"
7208,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",What quest he rode. Inscrutable deeds behind
7209,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","His visor, and along his sullen spear"
7210,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Adventure bitter as a burning ray,"
7211,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Into the night he galloped with the stars.
7212,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7213,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",*       *       *       *       *
7214,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7215,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And one lone night, two years thereafter,--lost"
7216,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Within a forest wilder than wild Dean;
7217,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Where neither wind nor water shook the leaves,"
7218,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",That hung as turned to stone above the moss
7219,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And grass, that wrapped the scaly rocks, death-dry,"
7220,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And barren torrents; where he had not found
7221,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Or man or hut, or slot of boar or deer,"
7222,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Through miles and miles of lamentable trees
7223,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And twisted thorns; beneath the autumn moon,--"
7224,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",(Pale as a nun's face seen in cloistered walks)--
7225,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Above dead tree-tops, like the rugged rock"
7226,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Of melancholy cliffs, he saw wild walls"
7227,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of some vague castle thrust gray battlements
7228,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And hoary towers, like a wizard's dream."
7229,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Great greedy weeds and burrs and briers packed
7230,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Its moat and roadway: at the very gate
7231,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Weeds higher than a man; their ancient stalks
7232,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Devoured with the dust and spider-webs,"
7233,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Or smothered with the slime where croaked the toad.
7234,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And Peredur against the portal rode,"
7235,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And with his spear-point beat upon its bolts
7236,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A sounding minute. But no wolf-hound bayed;
7237,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Only dull echoes of interior walls
7238,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And hollow rock that arched the empty halls.
7239,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And once again his truncheon shook the gate
7240,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And roused a round-eyed owl that screamed and blinked,"
7241,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Like some fierce gargoyle, on the bartizan;"
7242,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And from a crevice, like an omen, hurled"
7243,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","A frantic bat. And then he heard a grate,"
7244,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Concealed within the gloomy battlements,"
7245,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Slide slowly; and a lean, gaunt, red-haired youth,"
7246,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Lit with a link, addressed him. And he saw"
7247,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","That famine had sunk hollows in his cheeks,"
7248,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And fixed gaunt misery in mouth and eyes.
7249,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""What knight art thou?"" he asked. ""And whence dost come?""--"
7250,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And Peredur replied, ""First let me in."
7251,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",I am of Arthur's Court. Long have I ridd'n
7252,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Through miles and miles of melancholy woods.
7253,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The night begins to storm. And I would rest."""
7254,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Then said the youth, sad mirth about his mouth,"
7255,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Rest shalt thou; yea: and since thou, haply, hast"
7256,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Fasted all day, thou shalt break bread with us.""--"
7257,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Then he retired from the grated slide:
7258,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Undid harsh chains and shot back stubborn bolts;
7259,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And, stiff with rust, the snarling hinges swung."
7260,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And Peredur rode armed into a court,"
7261,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Neglected, and pathetic with strewn leaves"
7262,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And offal, where the weed and wire-grass"
7263,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Creviced with wisps the loose and broken stones:
7264,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And overhead, around the mournful walls,"
7265,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Huge oaks thrust ancient boughs of mistletoe
7266,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And withered leaves, whose twisted wildness seemed"
7267,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The beckoning arms of hunger, and the hands,"
7268,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Hooked and distorted, darkly threatening,"
7269,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Of murder; enemies that, pitiless,"
7270,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Had laid long siege to that old forest hold.
7271,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7272,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And he dismounted. And in clanking mail
7273,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Strode down the hall. And in the hall beheld
7274,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Youths, lean and auburn-haired, around the hearth;"
7275,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Some eighteen of an equal height, and clad"
7276,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Alike in dingy garments that looked worn
7277,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And old. And these were like to him who first
7278,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Had bid him welcome. And they greeted him
7279,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And took his arms; and bade him to a seat.
7280,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And then an inner door flung wide; and, lo,"
7281,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Five maidens, like five forest flowers, came;"
7282,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Dark-eyed, dark-haired. Behold, the queen of these"
7283,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Was Angharad. Clad in a ragged robe
7284,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of faded satin that had once been rich.
7285,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","She looked at Peredur, and he at her:"
7286,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And with glad eyes once more his soul beheld
7287,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The hair far blacker than the bird that wings
7288,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Athwart the milk-white moon: the matchless skin,"
7289,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Inviolably white as wind-flowers blown
7290,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Among the mighty gospels of the trees:
7291,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And in her cheeks, the rose of maidenhood"
7292,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Red as round berries winter bushes dot
7293,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The dimpled drift with under loaded boughs.
7294,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","She knew him not, or seemed to; or forgot"
7295,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",To speak his name whenas she looked at him
7296,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And, blushing, welcomed."
7297,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7298,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And they sat and talked
7299,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Until the night waxed late. And as they talked
7300,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",He marked that hunger had made hollow haunts
7301,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Of all their eyes; and so he longed to ask,"
7302,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","But courtesy forbade him. Late it grew,"
7303,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And late and later; and at last there came
7304,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","A knocking, and, as shadowy as two ghosts,"
7305,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Two nuns came gliding; sandalled silence in
7306,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Frail footsteps, and pale caution on pale lips."
7307,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","One brought a jar of wine, and one brought bread,"
7308,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Six loaves of wheaten flour. And these said,"
7309,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""God bear us witness, Lady, this is all!"
7310,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Now is our Convent barren as thy board;"""
7311,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And so departed. And they sat and ate.
7312,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7313,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",*       *       *       *       *
7314,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7315,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The wind upon the forest and the rain
7316,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Upon the turrets. Had he heard a sigh
7317,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Or was it but the echo of his own,"
7318,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Born of great weariness, that broke his rest?--"
7319,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","A dream! a dream!--The autumn storm is on,"
7320,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And sows the wood with witchcraft, and the leaves"
7321,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Are chased by imps of darkness through the hail
7322,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And hurling rain. The wind is wild with leaves.
7323,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Again he slept.
7324,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7325,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The rain among the trees,"
7326,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The wind upon the turrets. Had he moaned,"
7327,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Now that he lay awake and heard the wind
7328,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Hoot on the towers like a green-eyed owl?
7329,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The rain and wind. The night is black with rain.
7330,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Within the forest like a voice the wind;
7331,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And on the turrets, like swift feet, the rain."
7332,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Now was he sure 'twas weeping; and arose,"
7333,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And found her at his door; and took her hand,"
7334,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",That like a soft persuasion lay in his.
7335,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","He felt long sobbings shake it. And he said,"
7336,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Tell me, my sister, wherefore dost thou weep?"""
7337,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And Angharad, ""Yea; I will tell it thee.--"
7338,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",My name is Angharad. My father held
7339,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","An Earldom under Arthur, yea, the first"
7340,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","In all his Kingdom: and this Castle, too,"
7341,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Was his with cantrevs to the west and east.
7342,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",When I was but a girl Earl Addanc met
7343,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And loved me. Once, when hunting, he came here"
7344,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And sought my father and demanded me.
7345,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","He said he loved me, and would have but me"
7346,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","To grace his bed and board, this Earl! But I--"
7347,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","I did not love him, being but a child,"
7348,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",My father's only child; I could not love.
7349,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And so my father said this should not be.
7350,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The Earl was wroth. I heard his furious stride
7351,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Beneath my casement; double demons pinched
7352,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",His evil eyes and twenty gnarled his face.
7353,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",He cursed us ere he rode beyond our walls
7354,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Then to Caerleon was I sent; and there
7355,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Became a woman of young Gwenhwyvar,"
7356,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Until my father's death two years agone,"
7357,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","When I returned, a Countess, to find war"
7358,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And Addanc here around beleaguered walls.
7359,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",So hath he stripped me of my appanage;
7360,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Save this one keep, whose strength hath held out long,"
7361,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Manned by my foster brothers, brave and young,"
7362,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Strong to endure, but lacking still in arms;"
7363,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",No match for knights like Addanc. Thou hast met
7364,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The eighteen youths whose valor will not yield.
7365,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",But what avail their valor and their will
7366,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Against hard hunger, now our larder lacks,"
7367,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And lacks the Convent, too, whereon we leaned?"
7368,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And Addanc comes to-morrow morn; the truce
7369,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",For our one day's deliberation done.
7370,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",If he prevail--the thought is like hot hands
7371,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Here on my brain!--his oath is 'that the night
7372,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Shall see me given over to his grooms.'"""
7373,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",She wept with tremblings. Then said Peredur:
7374,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Go, dry thy tears, my sister. And this Earl--"
7375,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","If he be early, call me not too late."
7376,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Fear not. I will not go until my sword
7377,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Hath crossed the sword of so much wickedness,"
7378,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And proved this base ambition. Go and sleep."""
7379,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7380,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",*       *       *       *       *
7381,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7382,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A morning gray with mist that gathered drops
7383,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of drizzle on the ever dripping leaves.
7384,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And then the mist divided: ghostly mail,"
7385,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Spears and limp pennons, and the shadowy steeds"
7386,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Of shadowy knights and chieftains. And it seemed
7387,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A host of phantoms come to lay dim siege
7388,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",To phantom walls whose warriors were ghosts.
7389,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Afar a bugle flourished in the fog,"
7390,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Disconsolate; no echo of the wood
7391,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",To bear its music burden. To the moat
7392,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Advanced a herald. And within the wall
7393,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",The grate was opened; and the gaunt-eyed youth
7394,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Held parley with him: ""How the Earl would make"
7395,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","End of the long dispute to-day, and leave,"
7396,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","'Twixt three a single combat to decide."""
7397,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","So Peredur bade arm him, and prepare"
7398,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",His horse for battle; and bade give the Earl
7399,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","His answer for the Castle: ""That one knight"
7400,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Would try the hauberks of the banded three."""
7401,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And he rode forth: and one rode up and scoffed,--"
7402,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","A knight in russet armor with loud words,--"
7403,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Small means to large results, forsooth! Thou boast!"
7404,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A vicious palate hath thy appetite
7405,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",That feasted long with hunger and must now
7406,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Conclude the banquet with three deaths!--Sir Death,"
7407,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Here is thy death!"" and hacked at Peredur"
7408,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A heavy stroke that gashed his chain camail.
7409,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","But, rising in stiff stirrups, ere he passed,"
7410,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Two-handed swung the sword of Peredur,"
7411,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And helm and head of him who fell were twain,"
7412,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Halved like an apple. And the walls were glad.
7413,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7414,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Then came another, clad in silver mail,"
7415,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",As he were Galahad; and in the mist
7416,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Glimmered like moonlight. And with levelled spear
7417,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Demanded: ""Whence and what art thou? this stroke"
7418,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Was never fathered by long fasting.""--Then"
7419,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Quoth Peredur, ""I am of Arthur's Court.""--"
7420,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Then sneered the other with a mocking laugh,"
7421,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""A goodly service truly that of his,"
7422,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Since all his knights, whom I have met, have died!""--"
7423,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Quoth Peredur: ""Thy falsehood choke thee dead!"
7424,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Within thy throat thus do I nail thy lie!"""
7425,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And at his gorget hurled his ponderous spear,"
7426,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Ere that one met him, spurring at full speed,"
7427,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Disdainful. And the desperate stroke of him
7428,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Who had wrought havoc with the Table Round,"
7429,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Glanced shattering from the sloping shield, while he,"
7430,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Bent backwards o'er his saddle, rolled--his tongue"
7431,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Cleft at the root. And all the walls were glad.
7432,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7433,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Now came a third: a black knight and a black
7434,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Enormous steed. No words he wasted. But,"
7435,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The fierce spears splintered, from the baldrics burned"
7436,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Swift blades: and Battle held his breath a while
7437,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","To see the great shields rock beneath great blows,"
7438,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Oppose, deploy, as hilt to hilt they hewed"
7439,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",At heaume and gorget. While the conflict dripped
7440,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Between the splintered greaves from many wounds.
7441,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Then Peredur, his whole strength wrenching at"
7442,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Unyielding shelter of his foeman's shield,"
7443,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Beat down his guard and smote.--And Addanc lay
7444,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Beneath the son of Evrawc, whose swift hands"
7445,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Razed off his casque and laid a blind blade bare
7446,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Across hot eyes, and set a heel of steel"
7447,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Upon his throat and said: ""Thou coward curse!"
7448,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",What woman wilt thou war with now?--'Tis well
7449,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Thy features are thus evil and might breed
7450,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Nightmares among the kestrels, kites, and crows,"
7451,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Else hadst thou been, ere this,--so says my sword,--"

7472,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",To lend excuse unto his long delay?--
7473,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And so he went to her, and led her from"
7474,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Amid her maidens, and bespoke her how"
7475,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""He would ride hence and would but say farewell."""
7476,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7477,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A while she gazed at him. And when she spoke
7478,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","The springs of tears seemed starting in her throat,"
7479,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Crystal and quivering. But with steady gaze,"
7480,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Dost thou, my knight, desire then to go?"
7481,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Methought that thou wouldst tarry yet a while.--

7486,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And so returned with iron strides and said:
7487,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""Ay, by my God! Who knows I have not fought"

7497,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""My soul, my soul!"" she said; ""O my true soul!"
7498,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","This shall not be, my soul!""--He heard her low"

7509,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Or as the firstling bud, the wildwood rose,"

7511,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","""I have remembered. Think'st thou I have not?--"
7512,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","O son of Evrawc, thou who couldst not see,"

7514,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",A girl's dear secret through her tinsel acts.--
7515,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Or was _thy_ love but fancy?--Ah, too soon,"
7516,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",I heard the vapid ending of a tale
7517,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Coquetry had begun for other end.--
7518,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","But, if thou wilt, we can resume the tale;"

7521,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",And is it wedlock?--Both were wrong. The one:
7522,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Because his love was blind, impetuous,"
7523,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Nor saw the love that would have proved 'twas love,"
7524,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Not lust, before surrender. The other: that"
7525,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","She sought for wisdom in the frivolous,"
7526,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","And so made falsehood of her dearest truth,"
7527,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Deceived more than deceiving.--Wilt thou go?"""
7528,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",
7529,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",He had no rhetoric to make reply:
7530,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Only his arms about her, and his eyes"

7532,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC","Long time they stood.--Outside, the sunset flung"
7533,"PEREDUR, THE SON OF EVRAWC",Barbaric glory on the autumn wood.--

7916,THE DARK TOWER,
7917,THE DARK TOWER,--King Lear.
7918,THE DARK TOWER,
7919,THE DARK TOWER,
7920,THE DARK TOWER,"The hills around were iron,"
7921,THE DARK TOWER,"The sky, a boundless black,"
7922,THE DARK TOWER,Where wells of the lightning opened
7923,THE DARK TOWER,"And boiled with blazing rack,"
7924,THE DARK TOWER,"When he came to the giant castle,"
7925,THE DARK TOWER,The wild rain on his back.
7926,THE DARK TOWER,
7927,THE DARK TOWER,"Huge in the night and tempest,"
7928,THE DARK TOWER,"Over the cataract's bed,"
7929,THE DARK TOWER,"Its windows, ulcers of fire,"
7930,THE DARK TOWER,"Its gate, a hell-lit red,"
7931,THE DARK TOWER,The Dark Tower loomed; and wildly
7932,THE DARK TOWER,A voice sang overhead.
7933,THE DARK TOWER,
7934,THE DARK TOWER,"Thrice, under its warlock turrets,"
7935,THE DARK TOWER,Where the causeway of rock was laid;
7936,THE DARK TOWER,"Thrice, there at its owlet portal,"
7937,THE DARK TOWER,His scornful bugle brayed;
7938,THE DARK TOWER,"And the drawbridge clanged at his summons,"
7939,THE DARK TOWER,And he rode in unafraid.
7940,THE DARK TOWER,
7941,THE DARK TOWER,"The heavens were riven asunder,"
7942,THE DARK TOWER,One glare of blinding storm;
7943,THE DARK TOWER,"And the blackness, chasmed with thunder,"
7944,THE DARK TOWER,"Blazed form on demon form,"
7945,THE DARK TOWER,"As he rode in the court of the castle,"
7946,THE DARK TOWER,The shield upon his arm.
7947,THE DARK TOWER,
7948,THE DARK TOWER,His sword unsheathed and open
7949,THE DARK TOWER,"The vizor of his casque,"
7950,THE DARK TOWER,Childe Rowland entered the donjon
7951,THE DARK TOWER,His gauntlet should unmask:
7952,THE DARK TOWER,"But naught, save night and silence,"
7953,THE DARK TOWER,"He found, and none to ask."
7954,THE DARK TOWER,
7955,THE DARK TOWER,"His heel on the stair crashed iron,"
7956,THE DARK TOWER,His hand on the door clashed steel--
7957,THE DARK TOWER,"In the hall, the roar of the torrent,"
7958,THE DARK TOWER,"In the turret, the thunder's peal--"
7959,THE DARK TOWER,And there in the highest turret
7960,THE DARK TOWER,She sat at a spinning-wheel.
7961,THE DARK TOWER,
7962,THE DARK TOWER,"She spun the flax of a spindle,"
7963,THE DARK TOWER,All in a magic space;
7964,THE DARK TOWER,"She spun with her head bent downward,"
7965,THE DARK TOWER,"His Lady, fair of face;"
7966,THE DARK TOWER,"She spun, all wildly singing,"
7967,THE DARK TOWER,All spellbound in that place.
7968,THE DARK TOWER,
7969,THE DARK TOWER,"Again, when he gazed on her beauty,"
7970,THE DARK TOWER,The heart in his breast was wax;
7971,THE DARK TOWER,"Again, when he heard her singing,"
7972,THE DARK TOWER,The thews of his limbs grew lax--
7973,THE DARK TOWER,"She spun, nor saw him, spinning"
7974,THE DARK TOWER,A spindle of blood-red flax.
7975,THE DARK TOWER,
7976,THE DARK TOWER,"And now the flax was fire,"
7977,THE DARK TOWER,"That wrapped her, skein on skein;"
7978,THE DARK TOWER,"And now a flaming serpent,"
7979,THE DARK TOWER,And now a blazing chain;
7980,THE DARK TOWER,"But he seized the enchanted spindle,"
7981,THE DARK TOWER,And all its spells were vain.
7982,THE DARK TOWER,
7983,THE DARK TOWER,"She looked upon Childe Rowland,"
7984,THE DARK TOWER,"And never a word she said,"
7985,THE DARK TOWER,"But kissed his mouth and forehead,"
7986,THE DARK TOWER,And leaned on his breast her head...
7987,THE DARK TOWER,"She smiled upon Childe Rowland,"
7988,THE DARK TOWER,And into the night they fled.

7998,THE BLIND HARPER,"Old as their rock, black-mossed and dead,"
7999,THE BLIND HARPER,"Wild-swarmed with towers; and, flaming flung"
8000,THE BLIND HARPER,"Around them,--far, a moat of red,--"
8001,THE BLIND HARPER,A million poppies sprung.
8002,THE BLIND HARPER,
8003,THE BLIND HARPER,And here I harped.--All seemed asleep;
8004,THE BLIND HARPER,"Till, hoarse beneath, harsh hinges gnarred"
8005,THE BLIND HARPER,And iron clanged within the Keep:
8006,THE BLIND HARPER,"And then from one gaunt casement, barred"
8007,THE BLIND HARPER,"With night, a woman, dim and deep,"
8008,THE BLIND HARPER,Gazed at me long and hard.
8009,THE BLIND HARPER,
8010,THE BLIND HARPER,To her I sang. And as she leaned
8011,THE BLIND HARPER,"In beauty to me, dark and tall,"
8012,THE BLIND HARPER,"And loud I sang of Love, I gleaned"
8013,THE BLIND HARPER,An inkling of her Court withal:
8014,THE BLIND HARPER,"For, lo, above her, watched a Fiend,"
8015,THE BLIND HARPER,"Wolf-eyeballed, on the wall."
8016,THE BLIND HARPER,
8017,THE BLIND HARPER,"Still, still I sang. And then she laughed,"
8018,THE BLIND HARPER,Laughed loud and long and evilly;
8019,THE BLIND HARPER,And in her face I saw was craft
8020,THE BLIND HARPER,And hate and all the sins that be:
8021,THE BLIND HARPER,"And overhead, with pointed shaft,"
8022,THE BLIND HARPER,The Fiend glared down on me.
8023,THE BLIND HARPER,
8024,THE BLIND HARPER,"Still, still I harped. Then up she leapt,"
8025,THE BLIND HARPER,"When loud I sang of Ermengard,"
8026,THE BLIND HARPER,"The Queen of Love, whose Court is kept"
8027,THE BLIND HARPER,"At Anjou, I, who am her bard!"
8028,THE BLIND HARPER,"And from her side a raven swept,"
8029,THE BLIND HARPER,While loud she laughed and hard.
8030,THE BLIND HARPER,
8031,THE BLIND HARPER,Its iron beak had pierced my eyes
8032,THE BLIND HARPER,Before my mind had half divined
8033,THE BLIND HARPER,That those wild walls that touched the skies
8034,THE BLIND HARPER,"With Hell-built towers, terror-lined,"
8035,THE BLIND HARPER,"Were Lilith's,--mother of lusts and lies,--"
8036,THE BLIND HARPER,"Love's foe, who left me blind."

8047,CHILDE RONALD,Beneath an old oak tree.
8048,CHILDE RONALD,
8049,CHILDE RONALD,"And when Childe Ronald saw her there,"
8050,CHILDE RONALD,So fair and fresh of hue--

8063,CHILDE RONALD,
8064,CHILDE RONALD,She needs must mount; and through the wood
8065,CHILDE RONALD,They rode unto the sea:
8066,CHILDE RONALD,When in his towers at last she stood
8067,CHILDE RONALD,A pale-faced girl was she.

8069,CHILDE RONALD,"""Unbusk, unbusk her, tire-girls!"

8074,CHILDE RONALD,"They busked her in a shift of silk,"
8075,CHILDE RONALD,And in a samite gown:
8076,CHILDE RONALD,"They looped her throat with pearls like milk,"
8077,CHILDE RONALD,And crowned her with a crown.
8078,CHILDE RONALD,
8079,CHILDE RONALD,They brought her in unto the priest--
8080,CHILDE RONALD,She saw nor priest nor groom:--
8081,CHILDE RONALD,"They married her and made a feast,"
8082,CHILDE RONALD,Then led her to her room....

8114,CHILDE RONALD,"""And at the first curse, note for note,"

8139,CHILDE RONALD,"Within the room Childe Ronald stands,"
8140,CHILDE RONALD,Then sinks upon his knees--

8143,CHILDE RONALD,
8144,CHILDE RONALD,"He rises from his knees with dread,"
8145,CHILDE RONALD,He flies that room unblest--

8153,CHILDE RONALD,
8154,CHILDE RONALD,"Within the wood, the dark pine-wood,"

8158,CHILDE RONALD,
8159,CHILDE RONALD,With close-shut eyes and down-bowed head
8160,CHILDE RONALD,He rides among the trees--
8161,CHILDE RONALD,But evermore the restless dead
8162,CHILDE RONALD,There at his side he sees.
8163,CHILDE RONALD,
8164,CHILDE RONALD,And evermore the autumn blast

8292,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,With nightmare wind and rain.
8293,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,Witch-lights flared by me on the fen;
8294,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,And through the forest--was it then
8295,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,"The eyes of wolves? or ghosts of men,"
8296,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,That flamed and fled again?
8297,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,
8298,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,Still on I rode. My way was clear
8299,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,"From that wild time when, spear to spear,"
8300,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,"Deep in the wind-torn wood,"
8301,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,I met him!... Dead he lies beneath
8302,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,Your trysting oak. I clenched my teeth
8303,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,"And rode. My wound scarce let me breathe,"
8304,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,That filled my eyes with blood.
8305,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,
8306,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,And here I am. The blood may blind
8307,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,My eyesight still!... but I will find
8308,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,Thee through some inner eye!
8309,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,For God--He hath this thing in care!--
8310,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,"Yea! I will kiss again thy hair,"
8311,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,"Then tell thee of thy leman there,"
8312,THE LADY OF THE HILLS,And smite thee dead--and die.

8320,THE DEMON LOVER,The moon looks cold
8321,THE DEMON LOVER,On the withered wold;
8322,THE DEMON LOVER,The wind blows fierce and free:
8323,THE DEMON LOVER,The thin snow sifts
8324,THE DEMON LOVER,"And stings and drifts,"
8325,THE DEMON LOVER,Blown by the haunted tree.
8326,THE DEMON LOVER,
8327,THE DEMON LOVER,The gnarled tree groans;
8328,THE DEMON LOVER,"And sighs and moans,"
8329,THE DEMON LOVER,And shudders to its roots:
8330,THE DEMON LOVER,Is it the fear
8331,THE DEMON LOVER,Of a footstep near?
8332,THE DEMON LOVER,Or the owl in its top that hoots?
8333,THE DEMON LOVER,
8334,THE DEMON LOVER,Is it a gust
8335,THE DEMON LOVER,"Of thin snow-dust,"
8336,THE DEMON LOVER,The wind sweeps from the plain?--

8338,THE DEMON LOVER,That wails and drees?--

8340,THE DEMON LOVER,

8346,THE DEMON LOVER,Beneath the haunted tree.

8352,THE DEMON LOVER,Forth from the gloom
8353,THE DEMON LOVER,"A man stalks, still and white."
8354,THE DEMON LOVER,
8355,THE DEMON LOVER,His face is dim;
8356,THE DEMON LOVER,His sword swings grim;
8357,THE DEMON LOVER,His long cloak flutters wide:
8358,THE DEMON LOVER,His kiss falls bleak
8359,THE DEMON LOVER,"On her mouth and cheek,"
8360,THE DEMON LOVER,As he folds her to his side.
8361,THE DEMON LOVER,
8362,THE DEMON LOVER,What is it gleams?
8363,THE DEMON LOVER,What is it streams
8364,THE DEMON LOVER,So wan on Floramane?--

8366,THE DEMON LOVER,"Or his heart, she sees"

8375,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"In a kingdom of mist and moonlight,"
8376,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Or ever the world was known,"
8377,A PRINCESS OF THULE,Past leagues of unsailed water
8378,A PRINCESS OF THULE,There reigned a king whose daughter
8379,A PRINCESS OF THULE,Was fair as a starry stone.
8380,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8381,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"The Northern Lights were daylight,"
8382,A PRINCESS OF THULE,And day was twilight there:
8383,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"The king was wise and hoary,"
8384,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"And his daughter, like the glory"
8385,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Of seven kingdoms, fair."
8386,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8387,A PRINCESS OF THULE,The day was dim as moonlight;
8388,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"The night was misty gray,"
8389,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"With slips of dull stars, bluer"
8390,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Where the princess met her wooer,"
8391,A PRINCESS OF THULE,A page like the month of May.
8392,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8393,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"His face was white as moonlight,"
8394,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"His hair, a crumpled gold:"
8395,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Oh, she was wise as youth is,"
8396,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"And he was young as truth is,"
8397,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"And the king was old, was old."
8398,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8399,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"When day grew out of the moonlight,"
8400,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Across the misty wold,"
8401,A PRINCESS OF THULE,A-hunting or a-hawking
8402,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"They rode, forever mocking"
8403,A PRINCESS OF THULE,The good gray king and old.
8404,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8405,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"At night, in mist and moonlight,"
8406,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Where hung the horns and whips,"
8407,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"In courts to the kennels leading,"
8408,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Or where the hounds were feeding,"
8409,A PRINCESS OF THULE,He kissed her eyes and lips.
8410,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8411,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"They whispered in the moonlight,"
8412,A PRINCESS OF THULE,And kissed in moon and mist:--
8413,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"""Enough! we're done with hiding!""--"
8414,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"There came the old king riding,"
8415,A PRINCESS OF THULE,The hawk upon his wrist.
8416,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8417,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"Oh, fain was she and eager,"
8418,A PRINCESS OF THULE,And he was over fain;--
8419,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"""His cup and couch are ready.""--"
8420,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"""Then let thy hand be steady--"
8421,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"And he'll not wake again."""
8422,A PRINCESS OF THULE,
8423,A PRINCESS OF THULE,Is it the mist or moonlight?
8424,A PRINCESS OF THULE,Or a dead face staring up?--
8425,A PRINCESS OF THULE,"The old king's couch was ready,"
8426,A PRINCESS OF THULE,And his daughter's hand was steady
8427,A PRINCESS OF THULE,Giving the poisoned cup.

8433,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8434,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8435,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,For the mountains' hoarse greetings came hollow
8436,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,From stormy wind-chasms and caves;
8437,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And I heard their wild cataracts wallow;
8438,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"Like monsters, the white of their waves:"
8439,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And that shadow said, ""Lo! you must follow!"
8440,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And our path is o'er myriads of graves."""
8441,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8442,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Then I felt that the black earth was porous
8443,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And rotten with dust and with bones;
8444,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And I knew that the ground that now bore us
8445,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Was cadaverous with death as with stones;
8446,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And I saw burning eyes, heard sonorous"
8447,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And dolorous sighings and groans.
8448,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8449,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"But the night of the tempest and thunder,"
8450,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"The might of the terrible skies,"
8451,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And the fire of Hell, that,--coiled under"
8452,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"The hollow Earth,--smoulders and sighs,"
8453,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And the laughter of stars and their wonder,"
8454,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Mingled and mixed in her eyes.
8455,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8456,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And we clomb--and the moon, old and sterile,"
8457,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Clomb with us o'er torrent and scar:
8458,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And I yearned for her oceans of beryl,"
8459,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Wan mountains and cities of spar:
8460,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"""'Tis not well,"" then she said; ""you're in peril"
8461,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"Of falling and failing your star."""
8462,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8463,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And we clomb--through a murmur of pinions,"
8464,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And rattle of talons and plumes;
8465,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And a sense as of darkest dominions,"
8466,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"Deep, lost, of the dead and their tombs,"
8467,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"Swam round us, with all of their minions"
8468,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Of dreads and of dreams and of dooms.
8469,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8470,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And we clomb--till we stood at the portal
8471,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Of the uttermost point of the peak;
8472,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"And she led, with a step more than mortal,"
8473,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"On, upward, where glimmered a streak,"
8474,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"A star, a presence immortal,"
8475,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"A planet, whose light was still weak."
8476,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,
8477,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And we clomb--till the limbo of spirits
8478,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Of lusts and of sorrows below
8479,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,Swung nebular; and we were near its
8480,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,"Starred summit, its glory of glow."
8481,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,And we entered its light and could hear its
8482,THE DAUGHTER OF MERLIN,White music of silence and snow.

8500,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"Of such was I, Isolt! till, lo,"
8501,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"Your face on mine did gleam,"

8515,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,I know not how; I know not when;
8516,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,I only know that there
8517,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"She met me in the haunted glen,"
8518,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,A poppy in her hair.
8519,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,
8520,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"Her face seemed fair as Mary's is,"
8521,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,That knows nor sin nor wrong;
8522,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,Her presence filled the silences
8523,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,As music fills a song.
8524,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,
8525,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"And she was clad like the Mother of God,"
8526,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,As 'twere for Christ's sweet sake;
8527,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,But when she moved and where she trod
8528,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,A hiss went of a snake.
8529,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,
8530,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"Though seeming sinless, till I die"
8531,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,I shall not know for sure

8534,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,
8535,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"Nor why I kissed her soon and late,"
8536,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"And for her felt desire,"
8537,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,While loathing of her passion ate
8538,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,Into my heart like fire.
8539,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,
8540,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,Was it because my soul could tell
8541,TRISTRAM TO ISOLT,"That, like the poppy-flower,"

8560,THE KNIGHT-ERRANT,
8561,THE KNIGHT-ERRANT,"The winds, upon the woods and fields,"
8562,THE KNIGHT-ERRANT,"Are swords two fiends unsheathe,"

8621,THE FORESTER,
8622,THE FORESTER,I met him here at Ammendorf one spring.
8623,THE FORESTER,"It was the end of April and the Harz,"
8624,THE FORESTER,"Treed to their ruin-crested summits, seemed"
8625,THE FORESTER,"One pulse of tender green and delicate gold,"
8626,THE FORESTER,Beneath a heaven that was like the face
8627,THE FORESTER,Of girlhood waking into motherhood.
8628,THE FORESTER,"Along the furrowed meadow, freshly ploughed,"
8629,THE FORESTER,"The patient oxen, loamy to the knees,"
8630,THE FORESTER,Plodded or lowed or snuffed the fragrant soil;
8631,THE FORESTER,And in each thorn-tree hedge the wild bird sang
8632,THE FORESTER,"A song to spring, full of its own wild self"
8633,THE FORESTER,"And soul, that heard the blossom-laden May's"
8634,THE FORESTER,"Heart beating like a star at break of day,"
8635,THE FORESTER,"As, kissing red the roses, she drew near,"
8636,THE FORESTER,Her mouth's ripe rose all dewdrops and perfume.
8637,THE FORESTER,Here at this inn and underneath this tree
8638,THE FORESTER,"We took our wine, the morning prismed in its"
8639,THE FORESTER,Flame-crystalled gold.--A goodly vintage that!
8640,THE FORESTER,Tang with the ripeness of full twenty years.
8641,THE FORESTER,"Rare! I remember! wine that spurred the blood,"
8642,THE FORESTER,"That brought the heart glad to the songful lip,"
8643,THE FORESTER,And made the eyes unlatticed casements whence
8644,THE FORESTER,"A man's true soul smiled, breezy as the blue."
8645,THE FORESTER,"As royal a Rhenish, I will vouch to say,"
8646,THE FORESTER,"As that, old legends tell, which Necromance"
8647,THE FORESTER,"And Magic keep, gnome-guarded, in huge casks"
8648,THE FORESTER,"Of antique make deep in the Kyffhäuser,"
8649,THE FORESTER,"Webbed, frosty gray, with salt-petre and mold,"
8650,THE FORESTER,The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf.--
8651,THE FORESTER,
8652,THE FORESTER,So solaced by that wine we sat an hour
8653,THE FORESTER,He told me his intent in coming here.
8654,THE FORESTER,"His name was Rudolf; and his native place,"
8655,THE FORESTER,Franconia; but no word of parentage:
8656,THE FORESTER,Only his mind to don the buff and green
8657,THE FORESTER,And live a forester with us and be
8658,THE FORESTER,"Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick's train,"
8659,THE FORESTER,And for the Duke's estate even now was bound.
8660,THE FORESTER,
8661,THE FORESTER,"Tall was he for his age and strong and brown,"
8662,THE FORESTER,And lithe of limb; and with a face that seemed
8663,THE FORESTER,Hope's counterpart--but with the eyes of doubt:
8664,THE FORESTER,"Deep stealthy disks, instinct with starless night,"
8665,THE FORESTER,"That seemed to say, ""We're sure of Earth--at least"
8666,THE FORESTER,"For some short while, my friend; but afterward--"
8667,THE FORESTER,Nay! ransack not to-morrow till to-day
8668,THE FORESTER,"Lest it engulf thy joy before it is!""--"
8669,THE FORESTER,"And when he spoke, the fire in his eyes"
8670,THE FORESTER,Worked restless as a hunted animal's;
8671,THE FORESTER,"Or like the Count von Hackelnburg's,--the eyes"
8672,THE FORESTER,"Of the Wild Huntsman,--his that turn and turn"
8673,THE FORESTER,Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend.
8674,THE FORESTER,
8675,THE FORESTER,And then his smile! a thrust-like thing that curled
8676,THE FORESTER,His lips with heresy and incredible lore
8677,THE FORESTER,"When Christ's or th' Virgin's holy name was said,"
8678,THE FORESTER,Exclaimed in reverence or admonishment:
8679,THE FORESTER,"And once he sneered,--""What is this God you mouth,"
8680,THE FORESTER,Employ whose name to bless yourselves or damn?
8681,THE FORESTER,A curse or blessing?--It hath passed my skill
8682,THE FORESTER,T' interpret what He is. And then your faith--
8683,THE FORESTER,What is this faith that helps you unto Him?
8684,THE FORESTER,"Distinguishment unseen, design unlawed."
8685,THE FORESTER,"Why, earth, air, fire, and water, heat and cold,"
8686,THE FORESTER,Hint not at Him: and man alone it is
8687,THE FORESTER,Who needs must worship something. And for me--
8688,THE FORESTER,No God like that whom man hath kinged and crowned!
8689,THE FORESTER,Rather your Satan cramped in Hell--the Fiend!
8690,THE FORESTER,"God-countenanced as he is, and tricked with horns."
8691,THE FORESTER,"No God for me, bearded as Charlemagne,"
8692,THE FORESTER,"Throned on a tinsel throne of gold and jade,"
8693,THE FORESTER,Earth's pygmy monarchs imitate in mien
8694,THE FORESTER,"And mind and tyranny and majesty,"
8695,THE FORESTER,Aping a God in a sonorous Heaven.
8696,THE FORESTER,"Give me the Devil in all mercy then,"
8697,THE FORESTER,"Bad as he is! for I will none of such!"""
8698,THE FORESTER,And laughed an oily laugh of easy jest
8699,THE FORESTER,To bow out God and let the Devil in.

8704,THE FORESTER,]
8705,THE FORESTER,
8706,THE FORESTER,"Then, as it chanced, old Kurt had come that morn"
8707,THE FORESTER,With some six of his jerkined foresters
8708,THE FORESTER,"From the Thuringian forest; wet with dew,"
8709,THE FORESTER,And fresh as morn with early travel; bound
8710,THE FORESTER,"For Brunswick, Dummburg and the Hakel passed."
8711,THE FORESTER,"Chief huntsman he then to our lord the Duke,"
8712,THE FORESTER,And father of the loveliest maiden here
8713,THE FORESTER,"In Ammendorf, the sunny Ilsabe:"
8714,THE FORESTER,"Her mother dead, the gray-haired father prized"
8715,THE FORESTER,His daughter more than all that men hold dear;
8716,THE FORESTER,"His only happiness, who was beloved"
8717,THE FORESTER,"Of all as Lora of Thuringia was,"
8718,THE FORESTER,"For gentle ways that spoke a noble soul,"
8719,THE FORESTER,"Winning all hearts to love her and to praise,"
8720,THE FORESTER,As might a great and beautiful thought that holds
8721,THE FORESTER,Us by the simplest words.--Blue were her eyes
8722,THE FORESTER,As the high glory of a summer day.
8723,THE FORESTER,"Her hair,--serene and braided over brows"
8724,THE FORESTER,"White as a Harz dove's wing,--an auburn brown,"
8725,THE FORESTER,And deep as mists the sun has drenched with gold:
8726,THE FORESTER,"And her young presence, like embodied song,"
8727,THE FORESTER,"Filled every heart she smiled on with sweet calm,"
8728,THE FORESTER,"Like some Tyrolean melody of love,"
8729,THE FORESTER,Heard on an Alpine path at close of day
8730,THE FORESTER,When homing shepherds pipe to tinkling flocks:
8731,THE FORESTER,"Being with you a while, so, when she left,--"
8732,THE FORESTER,How shall I say it?--'twas as when one hath
8733,THE FORESTER,"Beheld an Undine on the moonlit Rhine,"
8734,THE FORESTER,"Who, ere the mind adjusts a thought, is gone,"
8735,THE FORESTER,And to the soul it seems it was a dream.
8736,THE FORESTER,
8737,THE FORESTER,"Some thirty years ago it was;--and I,"
8738,THE FORESTER,Commissioner of the Duke--(no sinecure
8739,THE FORESTER,I can assure you)--had scarce reached the age
8740,THE FORESTER,"Of thirty,--that we sat here at our wine;"
8741,THE FORESTER,"And 'twas through me that Rudolf,--whom at first,"
8742,THE FORESTER,"From some rash words dropped then in argument,"
8743,THE FORESTER,"The foresterhood was like to be denied,--"
8744,THE FORESTER,"Was then enfellowed. ""Yes,"" said I, ""he's young."
8745,THE FORESTER,"Kurt, he _is_ young: but look you! what a man!"
8746,THE FORESTER,What arms! what muscles! what a face--for deeds!
8747,THE FORESTER,An eye--that likes me not; too quick to turn!--
8748,THE FORESTER,But that may be the restless soul within:
8749,THE FORESTER,A soul perhaps with virtues that have been
8750,THE FORESTER,Severely tried and could not stand the test;
8751,THE FORESTER,"These be thy care, Kurt: and if not too deep"
8752,THE FORESTER,"In vices of the flesh, discover them,"
8753,THE FORESTER,As divers bring lost riches up from ooze.--
8754,THE FORESTER,"Thou hast a daughter; let him be thy son."""
8755,THE FORESTER,
8756,THE FORESTER,A year thereafter was it that I heard
8757,THE FORESTER,Of Rudolf's passion for Kurt's Ilsabe;
8758,THE FORESTER,"Then their betrothal. And it was from this,--"
8759,THE FORESTER,(How her fair memory haunts my old heart still!--
8760,THE FORESTER,"Sweet Ilsabe! whose higher womanhood,"
8761,THE FORESTER,True as the touchstone which philosophers feign
8762,THE FORESTER,"Transmutes to gold base metals it may touch,"
8763,THE FORESTER,"Had turned to good all evil in this man,)--"
8764,THE FORESTER,Surmised I of the excellency which
8765,THE FORESTER,"Refinement of her purer company,"
8766,THE FORESTER,"And contact with her innocence, had resolved"
8767,THE FORESTER,"His fiery nature to, conditioning slave."
8768,THE FORESTER,"And so I came from Brunswick--as, you know,"
8769,THE FORESTER,"Is custom of the Duke or, by his seal"
8770,THE FORESTER,"Commissioned proxy, his commissioner--"
8771,THE FORESTER,"To test the marksmanship of Rudolf, who"
8772,THE FORESTER,"Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child,"
8773,THE FORESTER,An heir of Kuno.--He?--Great-grandfather
8774,THE FORESTER,To Kurt; and of this forest-keepership
8775,THE FORESTER,The first possessor; thus established here--
8776,THE FORESTER,Or this the tale they tell on winter nights:--
8777,THE FORESTER,
8778,THE FORESTER,"Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train,"
8779,THE FORESTER,"Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came,--"
8780,THE FORESTER,"Grandfather of the father of our Duke,--"
8781,THE FORESTER,"With much magnificence of knights and squires,"
8782,THE FORESTER,"Great velvet-vestured nobles, cloaked and plumed,"
8783,THE FORESTER,"To hunt Thuringian deer. Then morn,--so rathe"
8784,THE FORESTER,To bid good-morrow to the husbandman
8785,THE FORESTER,"Heavy with slumber,--was too slow for these,"
8786,THE FORESTER,And on the wind-trod hills recumbent yawned
8787,THE FORESTER,"Aroused an hour too soon: ashamed, disrobed,"
8788,THE FORESTER,Rubbed the stiff sleep from eyes that still would close;
8789,THE FORESTER,"Like some young milkmaid whom the cock hath waked,"
8790,THE FORESTER,"Who sits within her loft and, half asleep,"
8791,THE FORESTER,"Stretches and hears the house below her stir,"
8792,THE FORESTER,"Yet sits and yawns, reluctant still to rise.--"
8793,THE FORESTER,"Horns sang and deer-hounds tugged a whimpering leash,"
8794,THE FORESTER,"Or, loosened, bounded through the baying glens:"
8795,THE FORESTER,"And ere the mountain mists, compact of white,"
8796,THE FORESTER,"Broke wild before the azure spears of day,"
8797,THE FORESTER,"The far-off hunt, that woke the woods to life,"
8798,THE FORESTER,Seemed but the heart-beat of the ancient hills.
8799,THE FORESTER,
8800,THE FORESTER,"And then, near noon, within a forest brake,"
8801,THE FORESTER,"The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag,"
8802,THE FORESTER,"Lashed to whose back with gnarly-knotted cords,"
8803,THE FORESTER,"And borne along like some pale parasite,"
8804,THE FORESTER,"A man shrieked: tangle-bearded, and his hair"
8805,THE FORESTER,"A mane of forest-burrs. The man himself,"
8806,THE FORESTER,Emaciated and half-naked from
8807,THE FORESTER,"The stag's mad flight through headlong rocks and trees,"
8808,THE FORESTER,"One bleeding bruise, his eyes two holes of fire."
8809,THE FORESTER,For such the law then: when the peasant chased
8810,THE FORESTER,"Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords,"
8811,THE FORESTER,"If caught, as punishment the withes and spine"
8812,THE FORESTER,"Of some strong stag, a gift to him of game"
8813,THE FORESTER,"Enough till death--death in the antlered herd,"
8814,THE FORESTER,Or slow starvation in the haggard hills.
8815,THE FORESTER,"Then was the great Duke glad, and forthwith cried"
8816,THE FORESTER,To all his hunting-train a rich reward
8817,THE FORESTER,"For him who slew the stag and saved the man,"
8818,THE FORESTER,But death for him who slew both man and beast.
8819,THE FORESTER,"So plunged the hunt after the hurrying slot,"
8820,THE FORESTER,"A shout and glimmer through the sounding woods,--"
8821,THE FORESTER,"Like some wild torrent that the hills have loosed,"
8822,THE FORESTER,Death for its goal.--'Twas late; and none had yet
8823,THE FORESTER,"Risked that hard shot,--too desperate the risk"
8824,THE FORESTER,"Beside the poor life and a little gold,--"
8825,THE FORESTER,"When this young Kuno, with hot eyes, wherein"
8826,THE FORESTER,"Hunt and impatience kindled reckless flame,"
8827,THE FORESTER,"Cried, ""Has the dew made wet each powder-pan?"
8828,THE FORESTER,Or have we left our marksmanship at home?
8829,THE FORESTER,"Here's for its heart! the Fiend direct my ball!""--"
8830,THE FORESTER,"And fired into a covert packed with briers,"
8831,THE FORESTER,"An intertangled wall of matted night,"
8832,THE FORESTER,Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive
8833,THE FORESTER,"To pierce one fathom, gaze one foot beyond:"
8834,THE FORESTER,"But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake,"
8835,THE FORESTER,"Heart-hit, and fell: and that wan wretch, unbound,"
8836,THE FORESTER,"Rescued, was cared for. Then his grace, the Duke,"
8837,THE FORESTER,"Charmed with the eagle aim, called Kuno up,"
8838,THE FORESTER,And there to him and his forever gave
8839,THE FORESTER,The forest-keepership.
8840,THE FORESTER,
8841,THE FORESTER,But envious tongues
8842,THE FORESTER,Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale
8843,THE FORESTER,"Of how the shot was ""free""; and how the balls"
8844,THE FORESTER,"Used by young Kuno were ""free"" bullets--which"
8845,THE FORESTER,"To say is: Lead by magic molded, in"
8846,THE FORESTER,The presence and directed of the Fiend.
8847,THE FORESTER,"Of some effect these tales, and of some force"
8848,THE FORESTER,"Even with the Duke, who lent an ear so far"
8849,THE FORESTER,As to ordain Kuno's descendants all
8850,THE FORESTER,To proof of skill ere their succession to
8851,THE FORESTER,The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot
8852,THE FORESTER,The silver ring out o' the popinjay's beak--
8853,THE FORESTER,"A good shot he, you see, who would succeed."
8854,THE FORESTER,
8855,THE FORESTER,The Devil guards his secrets close as God.
8856,THE FORESTER,"For who can say what elementaries,"
8857,THE FORESTER,"Demonic, lurk in desolate dells and hills"
8858,THE FORESTER,"And shadowy woods? malignant forces who,"
8859,THE FORESTER,"Malicious vassals of satanic power,"
8860,THE FORESTER,"Are agents to that Evil none may name,"
8861,THE FORESTER,"Who signs himself, through these, a slave to those,"
8862,THE FORESTER,"Those mortals who call in the aid of Hell,"
8863,THE FORESTER,"And for some earthly, transitory gift,"
8864,THE FORESTER,Barter their souls and all their hopes of Heaven.
8865,THE FORESTER,
8866,THE FORESTER,Of these enchanted bullets let me speak:
8867,THE FORESTER,"There may be such: our earth hath things as strange,"
8868,THE FORESTER,"Perhaps, and stranger, that we doubt not of,"
8869,THE FORESTER,"While we behold,--not only 'neath the thatch"
8870,THE FORESTER,"Of Ignorance's hovel,--but within"
8871,THE FORESTER,"The stately halls of Wisdom's palaces,"
8872,THE FORESTER,How Superstition sits an honored guest.
8873,THE FORESTER,
8874,THE FORESTER,"A cross-way, so they say, among the hills;"
8875,THE FORESTER,A cross-way in a solitude of pines;
8876,THE FORESTER,And on the lonely cross-way you must draw
8877,THE FORESTER,A bloody circle with a bloody sword;
8878,THE FORESTER,"And round the circle, runic characters,"
8879,THE FORESTER,"Weird and symbolic: here a skull, and there"
8880,THE FORESTER,"A scythe, and cross-bones, and an hour-glass here:"
8881,THE FORESTER,"And in the centre, fed with coffin-wood,"
8882,THE FORESTER,"Stolen from the grave of--say a murderer,"
8883,THE FORESTER,A fitful fire. Eleven of the clock
8884,THE FORESTER,The first ball leaves the mold--the sullen lead
8885,THE FORESTER,"Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark,"
8886,THE FORESTER,"And blood the wounded Sacramental Host,"
8887,THE FORESTER,"Stolen, and hence unhallowed, oozed when shot"
8888,THE FORESTER,"Fixed to a riven pine. Ere midnight strike,"
8889,THE FORESTER,"With never a word until that hour sound,"
8890,THE FORESTER,Must all the balls be cast; and these must be
8891,THE FORESTER,In number three and sixty; three of which
8892,THE FORESTER,"The Fiend's dark agent, demon Sammael,"
8893,THE FORESTER,Claims for his master and stamps for his own
8894,THE FORESTER,"To hit aside their mark, askew for harm."
8895,THE FORESTER,The other sixty shall not miss their mark.
8896,THE FORESTER,
8897,THE FORESTER,"No cry, no word, no whisper, even though"
8898,THE FORESTER,"Vague, gesturing shapes, that loom like moonlit mists,"
8899,THE FORESTER,"Their faces human but of animal form,"
8900,THE FORESTER,"Whinnying and whining lusts, faun-faced, goat-formed,"
8901,THE FORESTER,Rise thick around and threaten to destroy.
8902,THE FORESTER,"No cry, no word, no whisper should there come,"
8903,THE FORESTER,"Weeping, a wandering shadow like the girl"
8904,THE FORESTER,"You love, or loved, now lost to you, her eyes"
8905,THE FORESTER,"Hollow with tears; sad, palely beckoning"
8906,THE FORESTER,"With beautiful arms, or censuring; her face"
8907,THE FORESTER,"Wild with despondent love: who, if you speak"
8908,THE FORESTER,Or waver from that circle--hideous change!--
8909,THE FORESTER,"Shrinks to a wrinkled hag, whose harpy hands"
8910,THE FORESTER,Shall tear you limb from limb with horrible mirth.
8911,THE FORESTER,Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell
8912,THE FORESTER,Strike that anticipated hour; nor leave
8913,THE FORESTER,"By one short inch the circle, for, unseen"
8914,THE FORESTER,"Though now they be, Hell's minions still are there,"
8915,THE FORESTER,Watching with flaming eyes to seize your soul.
8916,THE FORESTER,"But when the hour of midnight sounds, will come"
8917,THE FORESTER,"A noise of galloping hoofs and outriders,"
8918,THE FORESTER,"Shouting: six midnight steeds,--their nostrils, pits"
8919,THE FORESTER,"Of burning blood,--postilioned, roll a stage,"
8920,THE FORESTER,Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire:
8921,THE FORESTER,"""Room there!--What, ho!--Who bars the mountain way?--"
8922,THE FORESTER,"On over him!""--But fear not, nor fare forth;"
8923,THE FORESTER,'Tis but the last trick of your bounden slave.
8924,THE FORESTER,And ere the red moon rushes from the clouds
8925,THE FORESTER,"And dives again, high the huge leaders leap,"
8926,THE FORESTER,"Their fore-hoofs flashing and their eyeballs flame,"
8927,THE FORESTER,"And, spun a spiral spark into the night,"
8928,THE FORESTER,Hissing the phantasm flies and fades away.
8929,THE FORESTER,"Some say there comes no stage; that Hackelnburg,"
8930,THE FORESTER,"Wild-Huntsman of the Harz, comes dark as storm,"
8931,THE FORESTER,With rain and wind and demon dogs of Hell;
8932,THE FORESTER,"The terror of his hunting-horn, an owl,"
8933,THE FORESTER,"And the dim deer he hunts, rush on before:"
8934,THE FORESTER,"The forests crash, and whirlwinds are the leaves,"
8935,THE FORESTER,"And all the skies a-thunder, as he hurls,"
8936,THE FORESTER,"Straight on the circle, horse and hounds and stag."
8937,THE FORESTER,"And at the last, plutonian-cloaked, there comes,--"
8938,THE FORESTER,"Infernal fire streaming from his eyes,--"
8939,THE FORESTER,"Upon a stallion gaunt and lurid black,"
8940,THE FORESTER,"The minister of Satan, Sammael,"
8941,THE FORESTER,"Who greets you, and informs you, and assures."
8942,THE FORESTER,
8943,THE FORESTER,"Enough! these wives' tales told, to what I've seen:"
8944,THE FORESTER,To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf here
8945,THE FORESTER,With Kurt and his assembled men in buff
8946,THE FORESTER,And woodland green were gathered at this inn.
8947,THE FORESTER,"The abundant Year--like some sweet wife,--a-smile"
8948,THE FORESTER,"At her brown baby, Autumn, in her arms,"
8949,THE FORESTER,Stood 'mid the garnered harvests of her fields
8950,THE FORESTER,Dreaming of days that pass like almoners
8951,THE FORESTER,Scattering their alms in minted gold of flowers;
8952,THE FORESTER,"Of nights, that forest all the skies with stars,"
8953,THE FORESTER,"Wherethrough the moon--bare-bosomed huntress--rides,"
8954,THE FORESTER,One cloud before her like a flying fawn.
8955,THE FORESTER,Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve
8956,THE FORESTER,The test of Rudolf's skill postponed; at which
8957,THE FORESTER,He seemed embarrassed. And 'twas then I heard
8958,THE FORESTER,How he an execrable marksman was;
8959,THE FORESTER,"And tales that told of close, incredible shots,"
8960,THE FORESTER,That missed their mark; or how the flint-lock oft
8961,THE FORESTER,"Flamed harmless powder, while the curious deer"
8962,THE FORESTER,"Stood staring, as in pity of such aim,"
8963,THE FORESTER,Or as inviting him to try once more.
8964,THE FORESTER,"Howbeit, he that day acquitted him"
8965,THE FORESTER,Of all this gossip; in that day's long hunt
8966,THE FORESTER,"Missing no shot, however rashly made"
8967,THE FORESTER,Or distant through the intercepting trees.
8968,THE FORESTER,"And the piled, various game brought down of all"
8969,THE FORESTER,"Good marksmen of Kurt's train had not sufficed,"
8970,THE FORESTER,"Doubled, nay, trebled, there to match his heap."
8971,THE FORESTER,"And marvelling the hunters saw, nor knew"
8972,THE FORESTER,"How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n,"
8973,THE FORESTER,Some told me that but yesterday old Kurt
8974,THE FORESTER,"Had made his daughter weep and Rudolf frown,"
8975,THE FORESTER,"By vowing end to their betrothéd love,"
8976,THE FORESTER,Unless that love developed better skill
8977,THE FORESTER,Against the morrow's test; his ancestors'
8978,THE FORESTER,High fame should not be tarnished. So he railed;
8979,THE FORESTER,Then bowed his gray head and sat moodily:
8980,THE FORESTER,"But, looking up, forgave all when he saw"
8981,THE FORESTER,Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone
8982,THE FORESTER,"Out in the night, black with approaching storm."
8983,THE FORESTER,
8984,THE FORESTER,"Before this inn, crowding the green, they stood,"
8985,THE FORESTER,The holiday village come to view the trial:
8986,THE FORESTER,Fair maidens and their comely mothers with
8987,THE FORESTER,Their sweethearts and their husbands. And I marked
8988,THE FORESTER,Kurt and his daughter here; his florid face
8989,THE FORESTER,All creased with smiles at Rudolf's great success;
8990,THE FORESTER,"Hers, radiant with happiness; for this"
8991,THE FORESTER,Her marriage eve--so had her father said--
8992,THE FORESTER,Should Rudolf come successful from the hunt.
8993,THE FORESTER,
8994,THE FORESTER,"So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do,"
8995,THE FORESTER,The trial of skill superfluous seemed; and so
8996,THE FORESTER,"Was on the bare brink of announcing, when"
8997,THE FORESTER,"Out of the western heaven's deepening red,--"
8998,THE FORESTER,"Like a white message dropped of scarlet lips,--"
8999,THE FORESTER,"A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there,"
9000,THE FORESTER,"Upon that limb, a peaceful moment sat."
9001,THE FORESTER,"Then I, ""Thy rifle, Rudolf! pierce its head!"""
9002,THE FORESTER,"Cried pointing, ""and chief-forester art thou!"""
9003,THE FORESTER,Why did he falter with a face as strange
9004,THE FORESTER,And strained as terror's? did his soul divine
9005,THE FORESTER,"What was to be, with tragic prescience?--"
9006,THE FORESTER,What a bad dream it all seems now!--Again
9007,THE FORESTER,"I see him aim. Again I hear her cry,"
9008,THE FORESTER,"""My dove! O Rudolf, do not kill my dove!"""
9009,THE FORESTER,"And from the crowd, like some sweet dove herself,"
9010,THE FORESTER,"A fluttering whiteness, rushed our Ilsabe--"
9011,THE FORESTER,Too late! the rifle cracked.... The unhurt dove
9012,THE FORESTER,"Rose, beating frightened wings--but Ilsabe!..."
9013,THE FORESTER,"My God! the sight!... fell smitten; sudden red,"
9014,THE FORESTER,"Sullying the whiteness of her bridal bodice,"
9015,THE FORESTER,Showed where the ball had pierced her innocent heart.
9016,THE FORESTER,
9017,THE FORESTER,"And Rudolf?--Ah, of him you still would know?"
9018,THE FORESTER,"--When he beheld this thing which he had done,"
9019,THE FORESTER,"Why, he went mad--I say--but others not."
9020,THE FORESTER,An hour he raved of how her life had paid
9021,THE FORESTER,"For the unholy missiles he had used,"
9022,THE FORESTER,And how his soul was three times lost and damned.
9023,THE FORESTER,I say that he went mad and fled forthwith
9024,THE FORESTER,"Into the haunted Harz.--Some say, to die"
9025,THE FORESTER,The prey of demons of the Dummburg ruin.
9026,THE FORESTER,"I,--one of those less superstitious,--say,"
9027,THE FORESTER,"He in the Bodé--from that blackened rock,--"
9028,THE FORESTER,"Whereon were found his hunting-cap and horn,--"
9029,THE FORESTER,"The Devil's Dancing Place, did leap and die."

9066,III,Showed me 'twas she. I marveled much to see
9067,III,"How lovely still she was! as fair, perchance,"
9068,III,"As when Red Rupert thrust her brutally,--"
9069,III,"Her long hair loosened,--down the shattered stair,"
9070,III,"And cast her, shrieking, 'mid his followers there."
9071,III,
9072,III,
9073,IV,IV
9074,IV,
9075,IV,"""She is for you! Take her! I promised it!"
9076,IV,"Take her, my bullies!""--shouting so, he flung"
9077,IV,"Her in their midst. Then, on her poor hands (split,"
9078,IV,And beaten by his dagger when she clung
9079,IV,"Resisting him) and knees, she crept a bit"
9080,IV,Nearer his feet and begged for death. No tongue
9081,IV,"Can tell the way he turned from her and cursed,"
9082,IV,Then bade his men draw lots for which were first.
9083,IV,
9084,IV,
9085,V,V
9086,V,
9087,V,"I saw it all from that low parapet,"
9088,V,"Where, bullet-wounded in the hip and head,"
9089,V,"I lay face-upward in the whispering wet,"
9090,V,Exhausted 'mid the dead and left for dead.
9091,V,We had held out two days without a let
9092,V,Against these bandits. You could trace with red
9093,V,From room to room how we resisted hard
9094,V,Since the great door crashed in to their petard.
9095,V,
9096,V,
9097,VI,VI
9098,VI,
9099,VI,"The rain revived me, and I leaned with pain"
9100,VI,"And saw her lying there, pale, soiled and splashed"
9101,VI,"And miserable; on her cheek a stain,"
9102,VI,"A dull red bruise, made when his mad hand dashed"
9103,VI,And struck her to the stones; the wretched rain
9104,VI,Dripped from her dark hair; and her hands were gashed.--
9105,VI,"Oh, for a musket or a petronel"
9106,VI,With which to send his devil's soul to hell!
9107,VI,
9108,VI,
9109,VII,VII
9110,VII,
9111,VII,"But helpless there I lay, no weapon near,"
9112,VII,Only the useless sword I could not reach
9113,VII,"His traitor's heart with, while I chafed to hear"
9114,VII,"The laugh, the insult and the villain speech"
9115,VII,"Of him to her.--Oh, God! could I but clear"
9116,VII,"The height between and, hanging like a leech,"
9117,VII,"My fingers at his throat, tear out his base"
9118,VII,"Vile tongue! yea, tear, and lash it in his face!"
9119,VII,
9120,VII,
9121,VIII,VIII
9122,VIII,
9123,VIII,"But, badly wounded, what could I but weep"
9124,VIII,With rage and pity of my helplessness
9125,VIII,And her misfortune! Could I only creep
9126,VIII,A little nearer so that she might guess
9127,VIII,"I was not dead; that I my life would keep,"
9128,VIII,"Dedicate to revenge!--Oh, the distress"
9129,VIII,"Of that last moment when, half-dead, I saw"
9130,VIII,Them mount and bear her swooning through the shaw.
9131,VIII,
9132,VIII,
9133,IX,IX
9134,IX,
9135,IX,Long time I lay unconscious. It befell
9136,IX,"Some woodsmen found me, having heard the sound"
9137,IX,"Of fighting cease that, for two days, made hell"
9138,IX,Of that wild region; ventured on the ground
9139,IX,For plunder: and it had not then gone well
9140,IX,"With me, I fear, had not their leader found"
9141,IX,That in some way I would repay his care;
9142,IX,So bore me to his hut and nursed me there.
9143,IX,
9144,IX,
9145,X,X
9146,X,
9147,X,How roughly kind he was! For weeks I hung
9148,X,"'Twixt life and death; health, like a varying, sick"
9149,X,"And fluttering pendulum, now this way swung,"
9150,X,"Now that, until at last its querulous tick"
9151,X,"Beat out life's usual time, and slowly rung"
9152,X,"The long, loud hours, that exclaimed, ""Be quick!--"
9153,X,Arise!--Go forth!--Hear how her black wrongs call!--
9154,X,"Make them the salve to cure thy wounds withal!""--"

9156,X,
9157,XI,XI
9158,XI,
9159,XI,"They were my balsam: for, ere autumn came,"
9160,XI,"Weak still, but over eager to be gone,"
9161,XI,I took my leave of him. A little lame
9162,XI,"From that hip wound, and somewhat thin and wan,"
9163,XI,I sought the village. Here I heard her name
9164,XI,And shame's made one. How Rupert passed one dawn;
9165,XI,How she among his troopers rode--astride
9166,XI,Like any man--pale-faced and feverish-eyed.
9167,XI,
9168,XI,
9169,XII,XII
9170,XII,
9171,XII,"Which way these took they pointed, and I went"
9172,XII,"Like fire after. Oh, the thought was good"
9173,XII,That they were on before! And much it meant
9174,XII,"To know she lived still; she, whose image stood"
9175,XII,"Like flame before me, making turbulent"
9176,XII,"Each heart-beat with her wrongs, that were fierce food"
9177,XII,"Unto my hate that, ""Courage!"" cried, ""Rest not!"
9178,XII,"Think of her there, and let thy haste be hot!"""
9179,XII,
9180,XII,
9181,XIII,XIII
9182,XIII,
9183,XIII,But months went by and still I had not found:
9184,XIII,"Yet, here and there, as wearily I sought,"
9185,XIII,I caught some news: how he had held his ground
9186,XIII,Against the Roundhead troops; or how he'd fought
9187,XIII,Then fled--returned and conquered. Like a hound
9188,XIII,"Questing a boar, I followed; but was brought"
9189,XIII,No nearer to my quarry. Day by day
9190,XIII,It seemed that Satan kept him from my way.
9191,XIII,
9192,XIII,
9193,XIV,XIV
9194,XIV,
9195,XIV,"A woman rode beside him, so they said,"
9196,XIV,"A fair-faced wanton, mounted like a man--"
9197,XIV,"Isolda!--my Isolda!--Better dead,"
9198,XIV,"Yea, dead and damned! than thus--the courtezan"
9199,XIV,"Bold, unreluctant, to such men! A dread,"
9200,XIV,"That such should be, unmanned me. Doubt began"
9201,XIV,"To whisper at my heart.--But I was mad,"
9202,XIV,"To insult her with such thoughts, whose love I had."
9203,XIV,
9204,XIV,
9205,XV,XV
9206,XV,
9207,XV,At last one day I rested in a glade
9208,XV,Near that same woodland which I lay in when
9209,XV,"Sore wounded: and, while sitting in the shade"
9210,XV,Of an old beech--what! did I dream? or men
9211,XV,Like Rupert's own ride near me? and a maid--
9212,XV,Isolda or her double!--Wildly then
9213,XV,"I rose and, shouting, leapt upon my horse;"
9214,XV,Unsheathed my sword and rode across their course.
9215,XV,
9216,XV,
9217,XVI,XVI
9218,XVI,
9219,XVI,"Mainly I looked for Rupert, and by name"
9220,XVI,"Challenged him forth:--""Dog! dost thou hide behind?--"
9221,XVI,Insulter of women! Coward! save where shame
9222,XVI,"And rapine call thee! God at last is kind,"
9223,XVI,"And my sword waits!""--Like an upbeating flame,"
9224,XVI,My voice rose to a windy shout; and blind
9225,XVI,"I seemed to sit, till, with an outstretched hand,"
9226,XVI,Isolda rode before me from that band.
9227,XVI,
9228,XVI,
9229,XVII,XVII
9230,XVII,
9231,XVII,"""Gerald!"" she cried; not as a soul surprised"
9232,XVII,"With gladness that the loved, deemed dead, still lives;"
9233,XVII,But like the soul that long hath realized
9234,XVII,Only misfortune and to fortune gives
9235,XVII,"No confidence, though it be recognized"
9236,XVII,"As good. She spoke: ""Lo, we are fugitives."
9237,XVII,"Rupert is slain. And I am going home."""
9238,XVII,"Then like a child asked simply, ""Wilt thou come?..."
9239,XVII,
9240,XVII,
9241,XVIII,XVIII
9242,XVIII,
9243,XVIII,"""Oh, I have suffered, Gerald! Oh, my God!"
9244,XVIII,What shame! What torture! Once my soul was clean--
9245,XVIII,Stained and defiled behold it!--I have trod
9246,XVIII,Sad ways of hell and horror. I have seen
9247,XVIII,"And lived all depths of lust. Yet, oh, my God!"
9248,XVIII,"Blameless I hold myself of what hath been,"
9249,XVIII,"Though through it all, yea,--this thou too must know,--"
9250,XVIII,"I loved him, my betrayer and thy foe!"""

9257,XIX,"All hope of mine.--So! it was for _his_ sake,"
9258,XIX,"_His_ love, that she had suffered!... Blind and fond,"
9259,XIX,"For what return!... And I--to nurse a snake,"
9260,XIX,And never dream its nature would respond
9261,XIX,With some such fang of venom! 'Twas for this

9265,XX,XX
9266,XX,
9267,XX,"At first half-stunned I stood; then blood and brain,"
9268,XX,"Like two stern judges, who had slept, awoke,"
9269,XX,"Rose up and thundered, ""Slay her!"" Every vein"
9270,XX,"And nerve responded, ""Slay her at a stroke!""--"
9271,XX,"And I had done it, but my heart again,"
9272,XX,"Like a strong captain in a tumult, spoke,"
9273,XX,And the fierce discord fell. And quietly
9274,XX,"I sheathed my sword and said, ""I'll go with thee."""
9275,XX,
9276,XX,
9277,XXI,XXI
9278,XXI,
9279,XXI,"But this was my reward for all I'd borne,"
9280,XXI,My loyalty and love! To see her eyes
9281,XXI,Hollow from tears for him; her thin cheeks worn
9282,XXI,"With grief for him; to know them all for lies,"
9283,XXI,"Her vows of faith to me; to come forlorn,"
9284,XXI,"Where I had hoped to come on Paradise,"
9285,XXI,"On Hell's black gulf; and, as if not enough,"
9286,XXI,"Soiled as she was and outcast, still to love!"

9288,XXI,
9289,XXII,XXII
9290,XXII,
9291,XXII,"Then rode one ruffian from the rest, clay-flecked"
9292,XXII,"From spur to plume with hurry; seized my rein,"
9293,XXII,"And--""What art _thou_,"" demanded, ""who hast checked"
9294,XXII,"Our way and challenged?""--Then, with some disdain,"
9295,XXII,"Isolda, ""Sir, my kinsman did expect"
9296,XXII,Your captain here. What honor may remain

9299,XXII,
9300,XXII,
9301,XXIII,XXIII
9302,XXIII,
9303,XXIII,We rode in silence. And at evening came
9304,XXIII,Unto the Moated Manse.--Great clouds had grown
9305,XXIII,"Up in the west, on which the sunset's flame"
9306,XXIII,Lay like the hand of slaughter.--Very lone
9307,XXIII,"Its rooms and halls: a splintered door that, lame,"
9308,XXIII,Swung on one hinge; a cabinet o'erthrown;
9309,XXIII,"Or arras torn; or blood-stain turning wan,"
9310,XXIII,Showed us the way the battle once had gone.
9311,XXIII,
9312,XXIII,
9313,XXIV,XXIV
9314,XXIV,
9315,XXIV,"We reached the tower-chamber towards the west,"
9316,XXIV,In which on that dark day she thought to hide
9317,XXIV,"From Rupert when, at last, 'twas manifest"
9318,XXIV,We could not hold the Manse. There was no pride
9319,XXIV,In her deep eyes now; nor did scorn invest
9320,XXIV,Her with such dignity as once defied
9321,XXIV,Him bursting in to find her standing here
9322,XXIV,Prepared to die like some dog-hunted deer.
9323,XXIV,
9324,XXIV,
9325,XXV,XXV
9326,XXV,
9327,XXV,"She took my hand, and, as if naught of love"
9328,XXV,"Had ever been between us, said,--""All know"
9329,XXV,The madness of that hour when with his glove
9330,XXV,"He struck, then slew my brother, and brought woe"
9331,XXV,"On all our house: and thou, incensed above"
9332,XXV,"The rest, came here, and made my foe thy foe."
9333,XXV,But he had left. 'Twas then I promised thee
9334,XXV,"My hand, but, ah! my heart was gone from me."
9335,XXV,
9336,XXV,
9337,XXVI,XXVI
9338,XXVI,
9339,XXVI,"""Yea, he had won me, this same Rupert, when"
9340,XXVI,He was our guest.--Thou know'st how gallantry
9341,XXVI,And recklessness make heroes of most men
9342,XXVI,To us weak women!--And so secretly
9343,XXVI,I vowed to be his wife. It happened then
9344,XXVI,My brother found him in some villainy;
9345,XXVI,The insult followed: Guy was killed ... and thou
9346,XXVI,Dost still remember how I made a vow.--
9347,XXVI,
9348,XXVI,
9349,XXVII,XXVII
9350,XXVII,
9351,XXVII,"""But still this man pursued me, and I held"
9352,XXVII,"Firm to my vow, albeit I loved him still,"
9353,XXVII,"Unknown to all, with all the love unquelled"
9354,XXVII,"Of first impressions, and against my will."
9355,XXVII,At last despair of winning me compelled
9356,XXVII,"Him to the oath he swore: He would not kill,"
9357,XXVII,But take me living and would make my life
9358,XXVII,A living death. No man should make me wife.

9361,XXVIII,XXVIII
9362,XXVIII,
9363,XXVIII,"""The war, that now consumes us, did, indeed,"
9364,XXVIII,"Give him occasion.--I had not been warned,"
9365,XXVIII,When down he came against me in the lead
9366,XXVIII,Of his marauders. With thy help I scorned
9367,XXVIII,His mad attacks two days. I would not plead
9368,XXVIII,"Nor parley with him, who came hoofed and horned,"
9369,XXVIII,"Like Satan's self in soul, and, with Hell's aid,"
9370,XXVIII,Took this strong house and kept the oath he made.
9371,XXVIII,

9373,XXIX,XXIX
9374,XXIX,
9375,XXIX,"""Months passed. Alas! it needs not here to tell"
9376,XXIX,What often thou hast heard: Of how he led

9378,XXIX,"Me of dishonor. Oft I wished me dead,"
9379,XXIX,"Loathing my life,--than which the nether Hell"
9380,XXIX,Hath less of horror!--So we fought or fled
9381,XXIX,"From place to place until a year had passed,"
9382,XXIX,And Parliament forces hemmed us in at last.

9386,XXX,
9387,XXX,"""Yea, I had only lived for this--to right"

9390,XXX,"Before the fight that should decide our fate,"
9391,XXX,I entered where he slept. There was no light
9392,XXX,Save of the stars to see by. Long and late

9402,XXXI,"Of pitying weakness swept me, and I bent--"
9403,XXXI,And kissed his face. Then prayed to God; and gave
9404,XXXI,My trust to God; and left to God th' event.--
9405,XXXI,"I never looked on Rupert's face again,"
9406,XXXI,For in the morning's combat--he was slain.

9415,XXXII,"The Moated Manse,--where our three-score or more"

9446,XXXV,
9447,XXXV,Then turning from me ere I could prevent
9448,XXXV,"Passed like a shadow from the shadowy room,"
9449,XXXV,Leaving my soul in shadow.... Naught was meant
9450,XXXV,By my sweet flower of love then! bloom by bloom
9451,XXXV,"I'd watched it wither; then its fragrance went,"
9452,XXXV,"And dust it was now.... It was dark as doom,"
9453,XXXV,"And bells seemed ringing far off in the rain,"
9454,XXXV,When from that house I turned my face again.
9455,XXXV,
9456,XXXV,
9457,XXXVI,XXXVI
9458,XXXVI,
9459,XXXVI,Then in the night a trumpet; and the dull
9460,XXXVI,Close thud of horse and clash of spurs and arms;
9461,XXXVI,And glimmering helms swept by me.--Sorrowful
9462,XXXVI,I stood and waited till against the storm's
9463,XXXVI,"Black breast, the Manse,--a burning carbuncle,--"
9464,XXXVI,"Blazed like a battle-beacon, and alarms"
9465,XXXVI,"Of onslaught clanged around it.--Then, like one,"

9508,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,If he told!--how we met on the autumn wold
9509,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"His daughter, sweet Clara of Clare, the day"
9510,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst,"
9511,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And trailing its jesses, came flying our way--"
9512,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,An untrained haggard the falconer cursed
9513,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,While he tried to secure:--as the eyas flew
9514,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Slant, low and heavily over us, Hugh,--"
9515,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Who saw it coming, and had just then cast"
9516,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"His peregrine hawk at a heron quarry,--"
9517,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In his saddle rising thus, as it passed"
9518,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"By the jesses caught, and to her did carry,"
9519,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Where she stood near the wood. Her face flushed rose
9520,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,With the glad of the meeting.--No two foes
9521,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Her eyes and my lord's, I swear, who saw"
9522,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,'Twas love from the start.--And I heard him speak;
9523,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Dismount, then kneel--and the sombre shaw,"
9524,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With the sad of the autumn waste and bleak,"
9525,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Grew spring with her smile, as the hawk she took"
9526,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"On her slender wrist, where it pruned and shook"
9527,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Its callowness. Then I saw him seize
9528,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The hand that she reached to him, long and white,"
9529,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,As she smilingly bade him rise from his knees--
9530,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,When he kissed her fingers her eyes grew bright.
9531,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"But her cheeks were pallid when, lashing through"
9532,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The thicket there, his face a-flare"
9533,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With the sting of the wind, and his gipsy hair"
9534,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Flying, the falconer came, and two"
9535,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Or three of the people of Castle Clare.
9536,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And the leaves of the autumn made a frame
9537,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,For the picture there in the morning's flame.
9538,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9539,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"What was said in that moment I do not know,"
9540,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,That moment of meeting between those lovers:
9541,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Whatever it was, 'twas whispered low,"
9542,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Soft as a leaf that swings and hovers,"
9543,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"A twinkling gold, when the woods are yellow."
9544,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And her face with the joy was still aglow
9545,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,When out of the wood that burly fellow
9546,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Came with his frown, and made a pause"
9547,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In the pulse of their words.--My lord, Sir Hugh,"
9548,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Stood with the soil on his knee. No cause
9549,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Had he, but his hanger he partly drew,"
9550,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Then clapped it sharp in its sheath again,"
9551,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And bowed to my lady, and strode away;"
9552,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And vaulting his horse, with a loosened rein"
9553,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Rode with a song in his heart all day.
9554,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9555,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"He loved and was loved, I knew; for, look!"
9556,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,All other sports for the chase he forsook.
9557,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And strange that he never went to hawk,"
9558,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Or hunt, but Clara would meet him there"
9559,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In the Strongbow forest!--I know the rock,"
9560,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With its ferns and its moss, by the bramble lair,"
9561,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Where oft and often he met--by chance,"
9562,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Shall I say?--the daughter of Clare; as fair
9563,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Of face as a queen in an old romance,"
9564,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Who waits expectant and pale; her hair
9565,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Night-deep; and eyes dove-gray with dreams;--
9566,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,By the fountain-side where the statue gleams
9567,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And the moonbeam lolls in the lily white,--"
9568,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,For her knightly lover who comes at night.
9569,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9570,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Heigh-ho! they ceased, those meetings. I wot,"
9571,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Betrayed to the Baron by some of his crew
9572,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of menials who followed and saw and knew.
9573,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,For she loved too well to have once forgot
9574,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The time and the place of their trysting true.
9575,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"""Why and when?"" would ask Sir Hugh"
9576,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,In the labored letters he used to lock
9577,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,--The lovers' post--in a coigne of that rock.
9578,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"She used to answer, but now did not."
9579,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"But, nearing Yule, love gat them again"
9580,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,A twilight tryst--through frowardness sure!--
9581,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"They met. And the day was gray with rain,"
9582,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And snow: and the wind did ever endure
9583,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"A long bleak moaning through the wood,"
9584,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,That chapped i' the cheek and smarted the blood;
9585,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And a burne in the forest went throb and throb,"
9586,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And over it all was the wild-beast sob
9587,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of the rushing boughs like a thing pursued.
9588,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And then it was that he learned how she,"
9589,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,(God's blood! how it makes my old limbs quiver
9590,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,To think what a miserable tyrant he--
9591,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The Baron Richard--aye and ever
9592,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,To his daughter was!) forsooth! _must_ wed
9593,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,With an eastern earl--a Lovell: to whom
9594,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,(Would God o' His mercy had struck him dead!)
9595,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Clara of Clare when merely a child,--"
9596,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With a face like a flower, that blows in the wild"
9597,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Of the hills, and a soul like its soft perfume,--"
9598,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Was given--say, sealed--to strengthen some ties"
9599,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Of power and wealth--say bartered, then,"
9600,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Like the veriest chattel. With tearful eyes
9601,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And lips a-tremble she spoke. And when
9602,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"My lord, her lover, had learned and heard,--"
9603,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"He'd have had her flee with him then, 'sdeath!"
9604,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In spite of them all! Let her say the word,"
9605,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,They would fly together: the baron's men
9606,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Might follow; and if ... and he touched his sword--
9607,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"_It_ should answer! But she, while she seemed to stay,"
9608,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With a hand on her bosom, her heart's quick breath,"
9609,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Replied to his heat: ""They would take and slay"
9610,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Thee who art life of my life!--Not thus
9611,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Will we fly!--There's another way for us;
9612,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,A way that is sure; an only way;
9613,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"I have thought on it this many a day.""--"
9614,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The words that she spake how well I remember!
9615,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"As well as the mood o' that day of December,"
9616,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"That bullied and blustered and seemed in league,"
9617,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Like a spiteful shrew, with the wind and the snow,"
9618,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"To drown the words of their sweet intrigue,"
9619,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With the boom of the boughs tossed to and fro,"
9620,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,That the storm swept through with its wild-beast low.
9621,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Her last words these, ""By curfew sure,"
9622,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"On Christmas eve, at the postern door."""
9623,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9624,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,*       *       *       *       *
9625,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9626,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And we were there; with a led horse too;
9627,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Armed for a journey--I hardly knew
9628,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Whither, but why, you well may guess."
9629,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"For often he whispered a certain name,"
9630,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The talisman dear of his happiness,"
9631,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,That warmed his blood like a Yule-log's flame.
9632,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"While we waited there, till its owner came,"
9633,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"We saw how the castle's baronial girth,"
9634,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Like a giant's, loosed for revelling more,"
9635,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Shone; and we heard the wassail and mirth
9636,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Where the mistletoe hung in the hearth's red roar,"
9637,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And the holly brightened the weaponed wall
9638,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of carven oak in the banqueting hall.
9639,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And the spits, I trow, by the scullions turned"
9640,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"O'er the snoring logs, rich steamed and burned,"
9641,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Where the whole wild-boar and the deer were roasted,"
9642,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And the half of an ox and the roe-buck's haunches;
9643,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"While tuns of ale, that the cellars boasted,"
9644,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And casks of sack, were broached for paunches"
9645,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of vassals who revelled in stable and hall.
9646,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The song of the minstrel; the yeomen's quarrel
9647,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,O'er the dice and the drink; and the huntsman's bawl
9648,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In the baying kennels, its hounds a-snarl"
9649,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"O'er the bones of the feast; now loud, now low,"
9650,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,We could hear where we crouched in the drifting snow.
9651,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9652,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Was she long? did she come?... By the postern we
9653,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Like shadows waited. My lord, Sir Hugh,"
9654,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Spoke, pointing a tower: ""That casement, see?"
9655,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,When a stealthy light in its slit burns blue
9656,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And signals thrice slowly, thus--'tis she."""
9657,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And close to his breast his gaberdine drew,"
9658,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,For the wind it whipped and the snow beat through.
9659,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Did she come?--We had waited an hour or twain,"
9660,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"When the taper flashed in the central pane,"
9661,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And flourished three times and vanished so.
9662,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And under the arch of the postern's portal,"
9663,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Crouched down by the horses we stood in the snow,"
9664,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Stiff with the cold.--Ah, me! immortal"
9665,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Minutes we waited, breath-bated, and listened"
9666,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Shivering there in the hurl of the gale:
9667,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The parapets whistled, the angles glistened,"
9668,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And the night around seemed one black wail
9669,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Of death, whose ominous presence over"
9670,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The snow-swept battlements seemed to hover.
9671,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Said my lord, Sir Hugh,--to himself he spoke,--"
9672,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"""She feels for the spring in the sliding panel"
9673,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"'Neath the arras, hid in the carven oak."
9674,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"It opens. The stair, like a well's dark channel,"
9675,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Yawns, and the draught makes her taper slope."
9676,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Wrapped deep in her mantle of fur, she puts"
9677,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,One foot on the stair: now a listening pause
9678,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,As nearer and nearer the mad search draws
9679,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of the thwarted castle. No smallest hope
9680,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,That they find her now that the panel shuts!
9681,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"If the wind, that howls like a tortured thing,"
9682,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Would throttle itself with its cries, then I"
9683,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Might hear how her hurrying footsteps ring
9684,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Down the secret ... there! 'tis her fingers try
9685,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The postern's bolts that the rust makes cling.""--"
9686,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,But 'twas only some whim of the wind that shook
9687,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,A clanging ring on a creaking hook
9688,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In the buttress or wall. And we waited, numb"
9689,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With the cold, till dawn--but she did not come."
9690,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9691,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"I must tell you why and have done: 'Tis said,"
9692,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,On the eve of the marriage she fled the side
9693,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of the guests and the bridegroom there: she fled
9694,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"With a mischievous laugh,--""I'll hide! I'll hide!"
9695,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"A kiss for the one who shall find!""--and led"
9696,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,A long search after her; but defied
9697,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,All search for--a score and ten long years.
9698,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Well, the laughter of Yule was turned to tears"
9699,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,For them as for us. We saw the glare
9700,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of torches that hurried from chamber to stair;
9701,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And we heard the castle reëcho her name,"
9702,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"But she laughed no answer and never came,"
9703,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And that was the last of Clara of Clare.
9704,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9705,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"That winter it was, a month thereafter,"
9706,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"That the home of the Cliffords, roof and rafter,"
9707,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Burned.--I could swear 'twas the Strongbow's doing,"
9708,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Were I sure that he knew of the Clifford's wooing
9709,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"His daughter; and so, by the Rood and Cross!"
9710,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Made a torch of Hugh's home to avenge his loss.--
9711,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"So over the Channel to France with his King,"
9712,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The Black Prince, sailed to the wars--to deaden"
9713,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The ache of the mystery--Hugh that spring
9714,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And fell at Poitiers; for his loss lay leaden
9715,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"O' his heart; and his life was a weary sadness,"
9716,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,So he flung it away in a moment's madness.
9717,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"And the baron died. And the bridegroom?--well,"
9718,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Unlucky was he in truth!--to tell
9719,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Of him there is nothing.--The baron died,"
9720,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,The last of the Strongbows he--gramercy!
9721,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And the Clare estate with its wealth and pride
9722,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Devolved to the Bloets, Walter and Percy."
9723,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9724,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And years went by. And it happened that they
9725,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Ransacked the old castle; and so, one day,"
9726,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"In a lonesome tower uprummaged a chest,"
9727,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"From Flanders; of ebon, and wildly carved"
9728,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,All over with masks: a sinister crest
9729,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,'Mid gargoyle faces distorted and starved:
9730,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Fast-fixed with a spring, which they forced and, lo!"
9731,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"When they opened it--Death, like a lady dressed,"
9732,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Grinned up at their terror!--but no, not so!"
9733,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Fantastic a skeleton, jeweled and wreathed"
9734,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,With flowers of dust; and a miniver
9735,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Around it clasped, that the ruin sheathed"
9736,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,Of a once rich raiment of silk and of fur.
9737,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9738,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"I'd have given my life to hear him tell,"
9739,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The courtly Clifford, how this befell!"
9740,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"He'd have known how it was: For, you see, in groping"
9741,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"For the secret spring of that panel, hoping"
9742,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And fearing as nearer and nearer drew
9743,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The search of retainers, why, out she blew"
9744,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"The tell-tale taper; and seeing this chest,"
9745,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Would hide her a minute in it, mayhap,"
9746,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"Till the hurry had passed; but the death-lock, pressed"
9747,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,"By the lid's great weight, shut down with a snap,"
9748,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,And her life went out in the hellish trap.
9749,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9750,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9751,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9752,AN OLD TALE RETOLD,
9753,MY LADY OF VERNE,MY LADY OF VERNE
9754,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9755,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9756,MY LADY OF VERNE,It all comes back as the end draws near;
9757,MY LADY OF VERNE,All comes back like a tale of old!
9758,MY LADY OF VERNE,Shall I tell you what? Will you lend an ear?
9759,MY LADY OF VERNE,"You, with your face so stern and cold;"
9760,MY LADY OF VERNE,"You, who have found me dying here...."
9761,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9762,MY LADY OF VERNE,Lady Valora's villa at Verne--
9763,MY LADY OF VERNE,"You have walked its terraces, where the fount"
9764,MY LADY OF VERNE,And statue gleam and the fluted urn;
9765,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Its world-old elms, that are avenues gaunt"
9766,MY LADY OF VERNE,Of shadow and flame when the west is a-burn.
9767,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9768,MY LADY OF VERNE,"'Tis a lonely region of tarns and trees,"
9769,MY LADY OF VERNE,And hollow hills that circle the west;
9770,MY LADY OF VERNE,Haunted of rooks and the far-off sea's
9771,MY LADY OF VERNE,Immemorial vague unrest;
9772,MY LADY OF VERNE,A land of sorrowful memories.
9773,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9774,MY LADY OF VERNE,"A gray sad land, where the wind has its will,"
9775,MY LADY OF VERNE,And the sun its way with the fruits and flowers;
9776,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Where ever the one all night is shrill,"
9777,MY LADY OF VERNE,And ever the other all day brings hours
9778,MY LADY OF VERNE,Of glimmering hush that dead dreams fill.
9779,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9780,MY LADY OF VERNE,"A gray sad land, where her girlhood grew"
9781,MY LADY OF VERNE,"To womanhood proud, that the hill-winds seemed"
9782,MY LADY OF VERNE,"To give their moods, like melody, to;"
9783,MY LADY OF VERNE,"And the stars, their thoughts, like dreams love dreamed--"
9784,MY LADY OF VERNE,The only glad thing that the sad land knew.
9785,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9786,MY LADY OF VERNE,"My Lady, you know, how nobly born!"
9787,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Greatly born, with a head that rose"
9788,MY LADY OF VERNE,Like a dream of empire; love and scorn
9789,MY LADY OF VERNE,Made haunts of her eyes; and her lips--twin bows
9790,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Of bloom, where wit was a pleasant thorn."
9791,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9792,MY LADY OF VERNE,"And I--oh, I was nobody: one"
9793,MY LADY OF VERNE,Her worshiper merely; who chose to be
9794,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Silent, seeing that love alone"
9795,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Was his only badge of nobility,"
9796,MY LADY OF VERNE,Set in his heart's escutcheon.
9797,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9798,MY LADY OF VERNE,"How long ago does the springtime look,"
9799,MY LADY OF VERNE,"When we wandered away to the hills! the hills,--"
9800,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Like the land in the tale in the Fairy-book,--"
9801,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Gold with the gold of the daffodils,"
9802,MY LADY OF VERNE,And gemmed with the crocus by bank and brook!
9803,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9804,MY LADY OF VERNE,"When I gathered a branch from a hawthorn tree,"
9805,MY LADY OF VERNE,"For her hair or bosom, from boughs that hung"
9806,MY LADY OF VERNE,Odorous of Heaven and purity;
9807,MY LADY OF VERNE,She thanked me smiling; then merrily sung
9808,MY LADY OF VERNE,This song while she laughingly looked at me:--
9809,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9810,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""_There dwelt a princess over the sea--"
9811,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Oh fair was she, right fair was she--"
9812,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Who loved a squire of low degree,"
9813,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Of low degree,"
9814,MY LADY OF VERNE,But wedded a king of Brittany--
9815,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Ah, woe is me! is me!_"
9816,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9817,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""_And it came to pass on the wedding day--"
9818,MY LADY OF VERNE,"So people say, I have heard say--"
9819,MY LADY OF VERNE,"That they found her dead in her bridal array,"
9820,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Her bridal array,"
9821,MY LADY OF VERNE,And dead her lover beside her lay--
9822,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Ah, well-away! away!_"
9823,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9824,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""A sour stave for your sweets,"" she said,"
9825,MY LADY OF VERNE,Pressing the blossoms against her lips:
9826,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Then petal by petal the branch she shred,"
9827,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Snowing the blooms from her finger-tips,"
9828,MY LADY OF VERNE,Tossing them down for her feet to tread.
9829,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9830,MY LADY OF VERNE,What to her was the look I gave
9831,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Of love despised!--Though she seemed to start,"
9832,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Seeing; and said, with a quick hand-wave,"
9833,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""Why, one would think that _that_ was your heart,"""
9834,MY LADY OF VERNE,While her face with a sudden thought grew grave.
9835,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9836,MY LADY OF VERNE,But I answered nothing. And so to her home
9837,MY LADY OF VERNE,"We came in the eve; slow-falling, clear"
9838,MY LADY OF VERNE,"With a few first stars and a crescent of foam,"
9839,MY LADY OF VERNE,The twilight dusked; and we heard from the mere
9840,MY LADY OF VERNE,The distant boom of a bittern come.
9841,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9842,MY LADY OF VERNE,Would you think that she loved me?--Who could say?--
9843,MY LADY OF VERNE,What a riddle unread was she to me!--
9844,MY LADY OF VERNE,When I kissed her fingers and turned away
9845,MY LADY OF VERNE,"I wanted to speak, but--what cared she,"
9846,MY LADY OF VERNE,Though her eyes looked soft and she bade me stay!
9847,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9848,MY LADY OF VERNE,Though she lingered to watch me--That might be
9849,MY LADY OF VERNE,"A slim moonbeam or a shred of haze,--"
9850,MY LADY OF VERNE,But never my Lady's drapery
9851,MY LADY OF VERNE,Or wistful face!--in the woodbine maze.
9852,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Valora of Verne--why, what cared she!"
9853,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9854,MY LADY OF VERNE,*       *       *       *       *
9855,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9856,MY LADY OF VERNE,"So the days went by, and the Summer wore"
9857,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Its hot heart out; and, a mighty slayer,"
9858,MY LADY OF VERNE,"The Autumn harried the land and shore,"
9859,MY LADY OF VERNE,And the world grew red with its wrecks; then grayer
9860,MY LADY OF VERNE,Than ghosts of the dreams of the nevermore.
9861,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9862,MY LADY OF VERNE,The sheaves of the Summer had long been bound;
9863,MY LADY OF VERNE,The harvests of Autumn had long been past;
9864,MY LADY OF VERNE,"And the snows of the Winter lay deep around,"
9865,MY LADY OF VERNE,When the hard news came and I knew at last;
9866,MY LADY OF VERNE,And the reigning woe of my heart was crowned.
9867,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9868,MY LADY OF VERNE,So I sought her here: the old Earl's bride:
9869,MY LADY OF VERNE,"In the ancient room, at the oriel dreaming,"
9870,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Pale as the blooms in her hair; and, wide,"
9871,MY LADY OF VERNE,"The dented satin, flung stormily, gleaming"
9872,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Like beaten silver, twilight-dyed."
9873,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9874,MY LADY OF VERNE,I marked as I stole to her side that tears
9875,MY LADY OF VERNE,Were vaguely large in her beautiful eyes;
9876,MY LADY OF VERNE,"That the loops of pearls on her throat, and years--"
9877,MY LADY OF VERNE,Old lace on her bosom were heaved with sighs:
9878,MY LADY OF VERNE,"And I said to her softly:--""It appears""--"
9879,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9880,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Then stopped with, it seemed, my soul in my eyes--"
9881,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""That you are not happy, Valora of Verne!"
9882,MY LADY OF VERNE,"There is that at your heart which--well, denies"
9883,MY LADY OF VERNE,These mocking mummeries.--Live and learn!--
9884,MY LADY OF VERNE,And is it the truth or only lies?--
9885,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9886,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""You must hear me now! whom I oft with my heart,--"
9887,MY LADY OF VERNE,"In words of the soul, that are silent in speech,--"
9888,MY LADY OF VERNE,Whispered my love; too sacred for art;
9889,MY LADY OF VERNE,But yours never heard--for I could not reach
9890,MY LADY OF VERNE,Yours in that world of which you are part.
9891,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9892,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""That world, where I saw you as one afar"
9893,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Sees palms and waters, and knows that sands,"
9894,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Pitiless sands, before him are;"
9895,MY LADY OF VERNE,Yet follows ever with reaching hands
9896,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Till he sinks at last.--You were my star,"
9897,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9898,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""My hope, my heaven!--I loved you!... Life"
9899,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Is less than nothing to me!""... She turned,"
9900,MY LADY OF VERNE,"With a wild look, saying--""Now I am his wife"
9901,MY LADY OF VERNE,You come and tell me!--Indeed you are learned
9902,MY LADY OF VERNE,"In the unheard language of hearts!""... A knife,"
9903,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9904,MY LADY OF VERNE,"As she ceased and leaned on a cabinet,--"
9905,MY LADY OF VERNE,"A curve of scintillant steel keen, cold,--"
9906,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Fell, icily clashing: a curio met"
9907,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Among Asian antiques, bronze and gold,"
9908,MY LADY OF VERNE,Mystical; curiously graven and set.
9909,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9910,MY LADY OF VERNE,"A Bactrian dagger, whose slightest prick,"
9911,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Through its ancient poison, was death, I knew.--"
9912,MY LADY OF VERNE,If true that she loved me--then!--And quick
9913,MY LADY OF VERNE,"To the unspoken thought she replied, ""'Tis true!"
9914,MY LADY OF VERNE,"I have loved you long, and my soul was sick,"
9915,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9916,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""Sick for the love that has made me weak,"
9917,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Weak to your will even now!""--And more"
9918,MY LADY OF VERNE,"She said, in my arms, that I will not speak--"
9919,MY LADY OF VERNE,And the dagger there on the polished floor
9920,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Ever her eyes, while she spoke, would seek."
9921,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9922,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""'And it came to pass on the wedding-day'""--"
9923,MY LADY OF VERNE,Then my lips for a moment were crushed to hers--
9924,MY LADY OF VERNE,"""'That they found her dead in her bridal array,'"""
9925,MY LADY OF VERNE,"She sang; then said, ""_You_ finish the verse!"
9926,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Finish the song, for you know the way."""
9927,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9928,MY LADY OF VERNE,"And I whispered ""yes,"" for my heart had thought"
9929,MY LADY OF VERNE,Her own thought through--that life were a hell
9930,MY LADY OF VERNE,To us so asunder.--And the blade I caught
9931,MY LADY OF VERNE,"With a sudden hand; and she leaned; and--well,"
9932,MY LADY OF VERNE,"What a little wound, and the blood it brought"
9933,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9934,MY LADY OF VERNE,To crimson her bosom!--I set her there
9935,MY LADY OF VERNE,"In that carven chair; then turned the blade,--"
9936,MY LADY OF VERNE,"With its white-gold handle thick with the glare,"
9937,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Barbaric, of jewels, wildly inlaid,--"
9938,MY LADY OF VERNE,"To my breast, for the poisonous point rent bare."
9939,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9940,MY LADY OF VERNE,"A stain of blood on her breast, and one"
9941,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Black red o'er my heart, you see.--'Tis good"
9942,MY LADY OF VERNE,"To die with her here!... Does the sinking sun,"
9943,MY LADY OF VERNE,"Through the dull deep west burst, banked with blood?--"
9944,MY LADY OF VERNE,Or is it that life will at last have done?...
9945,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9946,MY LADY OF VERNE,"So _you_ are her husband? and--well, you see,"
9947,MY LADY OF VERNE,You see she is dead ... and her face--how white!
9948,MY LADY OF VERNE,Fate bungled the cards!--did this _have_ to be?--
9949,MY LADY OF VERNE,What matters it now!--For at last the night
9950,MY LADY OF VERNE,Falls and the darkness covers me.
9951,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9952,MY LADY OF VERNE,
9953,MY LADY OF VERNE,

9956,GERALDINE,
9957,GERALDINE,
9958,GERALDINE,"Ah, Geraldine, my Geraldine,"
9959,GERALDINE,"That night of love when last we met,"
9960,GERALDINE,"You have forgotten, Geraldine--"
9961,GERALDINE,I never dreamed you would forget.
9962,GERALDINE,
9963,GERALDINE,"Ah, Geraldine, my Geraldine,"
9964,GERALDINE,"More lovely than that Asian queen,"
9965,GERALDINE,"Scheherazade, the beautiful,"
9966,GERALDINE,Who in her orient palace cool
9967,GERALDINE,"Of India, for a thousand nights"
9968,GERALDINE,"And one, beside her monarch lay,"
9969,GERALDINE,Telling--while sandal-scented lights
9970,GERALDINE,And music stole the soul away--
9971,GERALDINE,"Love tales of old Arabia,"
9972,GERALDINE,Full of enchantments and emprise--
9973,GERALDINE,But no enchantments like your eyes.
9974,GERALDINE,
9975,GERALDINE,"Ah, Geraldine, loved Geraldine,"
9976,GERALDINE,"Less lovely were those maids, I ween,"
9977,GERALDINE,"Pampinea and Lauretta, who,"
9978,GERALDINE,"In gardens old of dusk and dew,"
9979,GERALDINE,"Sat with their lovers, maid and man,"
9980,GERALDINE,"In stately days Italian,"
9981,GERALDINE,"And in quaint stories, that we know"
9982,GERALDINE,"Through grace of good Boccaccio,"
9983,GERALDINE,"Told of fond loves,--some false, some true,--"
9984,GERALDINE,"But, Geraldine, none false as you."
9985,GERALDINE,
9986,GERALDINE,"Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine,"
9987,GERALDINE,"That night of love, when last we met,"
9988,GERALDINE,"You have forgotten, Geraldine--"
9989,GERALDINE,I never dreamed you would forget.
9990,GERALDINE,"'Twas summer; and the moon swam high,"
9991,GERALDINE,A great pale pearl within the sky:
9992,GERALDINE,And down that purple night of love
9993,GERALDINE,"The stars, concurrent spark on spark,"
9994,GERALDINE,Seemed moths of flame that swarmed above:
9995,GERALDINE,"And through the roses, o'er the park,"
9996,GERALDINE,Star-like the fireflies sowed the dark:
9997,GERALDINE,"A mocking-bird in some deep tree,"
9998,GERALDINE,"Drowsy with dreams and melody,--"
9999,GERALDINE,"Like a magnolia bud, that, dim,"
10000,GERALDINE,"Opens and pours its soul in musk,--"
10001,GERALDINE,Gave to the moonlight and the dusk
10002,GERALDINE,"Its heart's pure song, its evening hymn."
10003,GERALDINE,"Oh, night of love! when in the dance"
10004,GERALDINE,"Your heart thrilled rapture into mine,"
10005,GERALDINE,"As, in a state of necromance,"
10006,GERALDINE,A mortal hears a voice divine.
10007,GERALDINE,"Oh, night of love! when from your glance"
10008,GERALDINE,I drank sweet death as men drink wine.
10009,GERALDINE,
10010,GERALDINE,You wearied of the waltz at last.
10011,GERALDINE,I led you out into the night.
10012,GERALDINE,Warm in my hand I held yours fast.
10013,GERALDINE,Your face was flushed; your eyes were bright.
10014,GERALDINE,The moon hung like a shell of light
10015,GERALDINE,"Above the lake, the tangled trees;"
10016,GERALDINE,And borne to us with fragrances
10017,GERALDINE,"Of roses that were ripe to fall,"
10018,GERALDINE,The soul of music from the hall
10019,GERALDINE,"Beat in the moonlight and the breeze,"
10020,GERALDINE,As youth's wild heart grown weary of
10021,GERALDINE,Desire and its dream of love.
10022,GERALDINE,
10023,GERALDINE,"I held your arm and, for a while,"
10024,GERALDINE,We walked along the balmy aisle
10025,GERALDINE,"Of blossoms that, like velvet, dips"
10026,GERALDINE,Unto the lake which lilies tile
10027,GERALDINE,"With stars; and hyacinths, with strips"
10028,GERALDINE,"Of heaven. And beside a fall,"
10029,GERALDINE,That down a ferned and mossy wall
10030,GERALDINE,"Fell in a lake,--deep, woodbine-wound,--"
10031,GERALDINE,A latticed summer-house we found;
10032,GERALDINE,A green kiosk; through which the sound
10033,GERALDINE,"Of waters and of zephyrs swayed,"
10034,GERALDINE,And honeysuckle bugles played
10035,GERALDINE,"Soft serenades of perfume sweet,--"
10036,GERALDINE,Around which ran a rustic seat.
10037,GERALDINE,"And seated in that haunted nook,--"
10038,GERALDINE,"I know not how it was,--a word,"
10039,GERALDINE,"A touch, perhaps, a sigh, a look,"
10040,GERALDINE,Was father to the kiss I took;
10041,GERALDINE,Great things grow out of small I've heard.
10042,GERALDINE,And then it was I took between
10043,GERALDINE,"My hands your face, loved Geraldine,"
10044,GERALDINE,"And gazed into your eyes, and told"
10045,GERALDINE,The story ever new though old.
10046,GERALDINE,"You did not look away, but met"
10047,GERALDINE,My eyes with eyes whose lids were wet
10048,GERALDINE,With tears of truth; and you did lean
10049,GERALDINE,"Your cheek to mine, my Geraldine.--"
10050,GERALDINE,I never dreamed you would forget.
10051,GERALDINE,
10052,GERALDINE,The night-wind and the water sighed:
10053,GERALDINE,"And through the leaves, that stirred above,"
10054,GERALDINE,The moonbeams swooned with music of
10055,GERALDINE,The dance--soft things in league with love:
10056,GERALDINE,I never dreamed that you had lied.
10057,GERALDINE,"How all comes back now, Geraldine!"
10058,GERALDINE,The melody; the glimmering scene;
10059,GERALDINE,"Your angel face; and ev'n,--between"
10060,GERALDINE,"Your lawny breasts,--the heart-shaped jewel,--"
10061,GERALDINE,"To which your breath gave fluctuant fuel,--"
10062,GERALDINE,A rosy star of stormy fire;
10063,GERALDINE,"The snowy drift of your attire,"
10064,GERALDINE,"Lace-deep and fragrant: and your hair,"
10065,GERALDINE,"Disordered in the dance, held back"
10066,GERALDINE,"By one gemmed pin,--a moonbeam there,"
10067,GERALDINE,Half-drowned within its night-like black.--
10068,GERALDINE,And I who sat beside you then
10069,GERALDINE,Seemed blessed above all mortal men.
10070,GERALDINE,
10071,GERALDINE,I loved you for the way you sighed;
10072,GERALDINE,"The way you said, ""I love but you;"""
10073,GERALDINE,The smile with which your lips replied;
10074,GERALDINE,"Your lips, that from my bosom drew"
10075,GERALDINE,"The soul; your looks, like undenied"
10076,GERALDINE,"Caresses, that seemed naught but true:"
10077,GERALDINE,I loved you for the violet scent
10078,GERALDINE,That clung about you as a flower;
10079,GERALDINE,"Your moods, where grief and gladness blent,"
10080,GERALDINE,An April-tide of sun and shower;
10081,GERALDINE,"You were my creed, my testament,"
10082,GERALDINE,Wherein I met with God's high power.
10083,GERALDINE,Was it because the loving see
10084,GERALDINE,Only what they desire shall be
10085,GERALDINE,"There in the well-belovéd's soul,"
10086,GERALDINE,"Passion and heart's affinity,"
10087,GERALDINE,That I beheld in you the whole
10088,GERALDINE,Of my love's image? and believed
10089,GERALDINE,You loved as I loved? nor perceived
10090,GERALDINE,"Yours was a mask, a mockery!"
10091,GERALDINE,
10092,GERALDINE,"Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine,"
10093,GERALDINE,"That night of love, when last we met,"
10094,GERALDINE,"You have forgotten, Geraldine--"
10095,GERALDINE,I never dreamed you would forget.

10115,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"And more that he, smiling, swallowed."
10116,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,
10117,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,And with vows as soft as his oaths were sweet
10118,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,Her heart he barricaded;
10119,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"And pressed this point with a present meet,"
10120,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,And that point serenaded.
10121,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,
10122,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,What else could the enemy do but yield
10123,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,To such handsome importuning?
10124,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,A gallant blade with a lute for shield
10125,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,All night at her lattice mooning!
10126,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,
10127,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"""_Que es estrella!_ thou star of all girls!"
10128,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,Here's that for thy fierce duenna:

10130,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,And gold as yellow as henna.
10131,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,
10132,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"""She will drop from thy balcony's rail, my sweet,"

10144,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"A Don Diabolus! sword at knee,"
10145,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,And face and hair--vermilion.
10146,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,
10147,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,And his is a jealous love; and--for
10148,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,The story grows sadder and sadder--
10149,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"He watches, and sees--a robber? to her,"
10150,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,Or gallant? ascend a ladder.
10151,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,

10154,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,"An alguazil, with a face like doom,"
10155,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,Sure of a stout withstanding.
10156,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,

10158,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,The Count's first thrusts were vicious:
10159,AT THE CORREGIDOR'S,Three thrusts to the floor Odora had brought:

10668,THAMUS,
10669,THAMUS,And it is said that Thamus sailed
10670,THAMUS,Off islands of Ægean seas
10671,THAMUS,No seaman yet had ever hailed;
10672,THAMUS,"No vessel touched, no ship of Greece,"
10673,THAMUS,Phœnician or the Chersonese.
10674,THAMUS,
10675,THAMUS,"And, lying all becalmed, 'tis told"
10676,THAMUS,How wonderful with peace that night
10677,THAMUS,Rolled out of dusk and dreamy gold
10678,THAMUS,"One star, whose splendor seemed to light"
10679,THAMUS,The world with majesty and might.
10680,THAMUS,
10681,THAMUS,Like shadows on a shadow-ship
10682,THAMUS,"The dark-haired, dark-eyed sailors lay;"
10683,THAMUS,"When from the island seemed to slip,"
10684,THAMUS,"Borne overhead and far away,"
10685,THAMUS,"A voice that ""Thamus!"" seemed to say."
10686,THAMUS,
10687,THAMUS,"Then silence: and the languid Greek,"
10688,THAMUS,"The lounging Cretan, watched the sky,"
10689,THAMUS,"Or, in carousal, ceased to speak"
10690,THAMUS,And sing. Again came rolling by
10691,THAMUS,"The voice, and ""Thamus!"" in its cry."
10692,THAMUS,
10693,THAMUS,"All were awake: tall, swarthy men"
10694,THAMUS,"With bated breath stood listening,"
10695,THAMUS,"Or gravely scanned the shore. And then,"
10696,THAMUS,"Although they saw no living thing,"
10697,THAMUS,Again they heard the summons ring.
10698,THAMUS,
10699,THAMUS,"And ""Thamus!"" sounded shore and sea:"
10700,THAMUS,"And at the third call leaned the Greek,"
10701,THAMUS,Full facing toward the isle; and he
10702,THAMUS,Cried to the voice and bade it speak
10703,THAMUS,"The mission, message it would seek."
10704,THAMUS,
10705,THAMUS,"""Thou shalt sail on to such a place"
10706,THAMUS,"Among the pagan seas,"" it said;"
10707,THAMUS,"""To such a land: and thou shalt face"
10708,THAMUS,"Against it when the east is red,"
10709,THAMUS,"And cry aloud, 'Great Pan is dead!'""..."
10710,THAMUS,
10711,THAMUS,As fearful of unholy word
10712,THAMUS,Their souls stood stricken with strange fear.
10713,THAMUS,"Then Thamus said, ""Yea, I have heard."
10714,THAMUS,Yet 'tis my purpose still to steer
10715,THAMUS,"Straight on. That land shall never hear!"""
10716,THAMUS,
10717,THAMUS,And so they sailed that night; and came
10718,THAMUS,Into an unknown sea; and there
10719,THAMUS,The east burnt like a sword of flame
10720,THAMUS,A Cyclops forges: straight the air
10721,THAMUS,Fell sick with calm: the morn was fair.
10722,THAMUS,
10723,THAMUS,Then double dread was theirs; and dread
10724,THAMUS,Was Thamus'; and he raised his hand
10725,THAMUS,"And shouted, ""Pan! great Pan is dead!"""
10726,THAMUS,And all the twilight-haunted land
10727,THAMUS,"Cried, ""Pan is dead!"" from peak to strand."
10728,THAMUS,
10729,THAMUS,They saw pale shrines and temples nod
10730,THAMUS,Among the shaken trees: and pale
10731,THAMUS,Wild forms of goddess and of god
10732,THAMUS,Crawl forth with crumbling limbs and trail
10733,THAMUS,"Woe, till the dim land grew one wail.--"
10734,THAMUS,
10735,THAMUS,What tripods groaned?--Serapis first
10736,THAMUS,Within Canopus' temples heard
10737,THAMUS,"The word, and his brute granite burst"
10738,THAMUS,Its monster bulk. Dodona stirred
10739,THAMUS,And bowed its oaks before the word
10740,THAMUS,
10741,THAMUS,That left them thunder-riv'n; then passed
10742,THAMUS,"To Aphaca where, marble-hewn,"
10743,THAMUS,Venus possessed a well that glassed
10744,THAMUS,"Her form, white-burning, like the moon--"
10745,THAMUS,And lo! her loveliness lay strewn.
10746,THAMUS,
10747,THAMUS,"Then o'er Cilicia swept, and bent"
10748,THAMUS,"Sarpedon's oracle with scorn,"
10749,THAMUS,Apollo.--Yea! the gods lay rent

10954,THE PORTRAIT,Three sable mallets--arms of Herancour--

10967,THE PORTRAIT,"The house, De Herancour's: on floors, splashed red,"
10968,THE PORTRAIT,Torchlight of Medicean wrath is shed:
10969,THE PORTRAIT,"Down carven corridors and rooms,--where couch"

10971,THE PORTRAIT,"Torch-pierced, with fear,--a sound of swords draws near,"
10972,THE PORTRAIT,The stir of searching steel.

10974,THE PORTRAIT,What find they here
10975,THE PORTRAIT,On St. Bartholomew's?--A Huguenot

10993,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
10994,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
10995,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Against each prince now she had held her own,"
10996,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,An easy victor for the seven years
10997,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"O'er kings and sons of kings--Eddetma, she,"
10998,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Who, when much sought in marriage, hating men,"
10999,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Espoused their ways to win beyond their strength
11000,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Through martial exercise and hero deeds:
11001,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"She, who, accomplished in all warlike arts,"
11002,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Had heralds cry through every kingdom known--
11003,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"_""Eddetma weds with none but him who proves"
11004,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Himself her master in the test of arms;
11005,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Her suitors' foeman she. And he who fails,"
11006,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"So overcome of woman, woman-scorned,"
11007,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Disarmed, dishonored, yet shall he depart,"
11008,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Brow-bearing, forehead-stigmatized with fire,"
11009,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"The branded words, 'Eddetma's freedman this!'""_"
11010,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And many princes came to woo with arms,"
11011,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Whom her high maiden prowess put to shame;
11012,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Pretentious courtiers small in thew and thigh,"
11013,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Proud-palanquined from principalities
11014,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Of Irak and of Hind and farther Sind.
11015,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Though she was womanly as that Empress of
11016,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"The proud Amalekites, Tedmureh, and"
11017,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"More beautiful, yet she had held her own."
11018,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11019,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"To Behram of the Territories, one"
11020,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Son of a Persian monarch swaying kings,"
11021,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Came bruit of her and her great victories,"
11022,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Her maiden beauty and her warrior strength.
11023,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Eastward he journeyed from his father's Court,"
11024,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"With men and steeds and store of wealth and arms,"
11025,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"To the rich city where her father reigned,"
11026,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Its seven citadels set above the sea,"
11027,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Like seven Afrits, threatening all the world;"
11028,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And messengered the monarch with a gift
11029,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Of savage vessels wroughten out of gold,"
11030,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Of foreign fabrics stiff with gems and gold.
11031,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Vizier-ambassadored the old king gave
11032,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,His answer to the suitor:--
11033,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11034,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""I, my son,--"
11035,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,What grace have I beyond the grace of God?
11036,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,What power is mine but a material?
11037,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,What rule have I but a mere temporal?
11038,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Me, than the shadow of the Prophet's shade"
11039,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Less, God invests with power but of man;"
11040,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Yea! and man's right is but the right of God;
11041,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,_His_ the dominion of the secret soul--
11042,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And His her soul! Now hath my daughter sworn,"
11043,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"By all her vestal soul, that none shall know"
11044,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Her but her better in the listed field,"
11045,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Determining spear and sword. Grant Fate thy trust.
11046,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,She hangs her hand upon to-morrow's joust.--
11047,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Allah is great!--My greeting and farewell."""
11048,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11049,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And so the lists of war and love arose,"
11050,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Wherein Eddetma with her suitor strove.
11051,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Mailed in Chorasmian armor, helm and spur,"
11052,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,On a great steed she came; Davidean crest
11053,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And hauberk one fierce blaze of gems. The prince,"
11054,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Harnessed in scaly gold Arabian, rode"
11055,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,To meet her; on his arm a mighty shield
11056,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Of Syrian silver high embossed with gold.
11057,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,So clanged the prologue of the battle. As
11058,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Closer it waxed, Prince Behram, who a while"
11059,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Withheld his valor,--in that she he loved"
11060,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Opposed him and beset him, woman whom"
11061,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"He had not scathed for the Chosroës' wealth,--"
11062,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Beheld his folly: how he were undone
11063,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"With shining shame unless he strove withal,"
11064,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Whirled fiery sword and smote the bassinet
11065,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,That helmed the haughty face that long had scorned
11066,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"The wide world's vanquished royalty, and so"
11067,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Rushed on his own defeat. For, like unto"
11068,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"A cloud, that caverned the bright moon all eve,"
11069,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"That thunder splits and, virgin triumph, there"
11070,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"She sails a silver aspect, so the helm,"
11071,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Hurled from her head, unhusked her golden hair,"
11072,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And glorious, glowing face. By his own blow"
11073,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Was Behram vanquished. All his wavering strength
11074,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Swerved from its purpose. With no final stroke
11075,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Stunned stood he and surrendered: stared and stared,"
11076,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"All his strong life absorbed into her face,"
11077,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"All the wild warrior arrowed by her eyes,"
11078,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Tamed and obedient to her word and look.
11079,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Then she on him, as eagle on a kite,"
11080,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Plunged pitiless and beautiful and fierce,"
11081,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,One trophy more to added victories:
11082,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Haled off his mail, amazement dazing him;"
11083,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Seized steed and arms, confusion filling him;"
11084,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And scoffed him forth brow-branded with his shame.
11085,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11086,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Dazzled, six days he sat, a staring trance;"
11087,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"But on the seventh, casting stupor off,"
11088,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Rose, and the straitness of the case, that held"
11089,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Him as with manacles of knitted fire,"
11090,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Considered--and decided on a way....
11091,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11092,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Once when Eddetma with an houri band
11093,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Of high-born damsels, under eunuch guard,"
11094,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"In the walled palace pleasaunce took her ease,"
11095,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Under a myrrh-bush by a fountain side,--"
11096,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Where marble Peris poured a diamond rain
11097,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"In scooped cornelian,--one, a dim, hoar head,--"
11098,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"A patriarch 'mid gardener underlings,--"
11099,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Bent spreading gems and priceless ornaments
11100,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Of jewelled amulets of hollow gold
11101,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Sweet with imprisoned ambergris and musk;
11102,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Symbolic stones in sorcerous carcanets;
11103,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Gem talismans in cabalistic gold.
11104,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Whereon the princess marvelled and bade ask--
11105,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,What did the ancient with his riches there?
11106,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Who, questioned, mumbled in his bushy beard,"
11107,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""To buy a wife withal;"" whereat they laughed"
11108,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"As oafs when wisdom stumbles. Quoth a maid,"
11109,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"With orient midnight in her starry eyes,"
11110,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And tropic music on her languid tongue,"
11111,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""And what if _I_ should wed with thee, O beard"
11112,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Grayer than my great-grandfather, what then?""--"
11113,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""One kiss, no more; and, child, thou were divorced,"""
11114,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"He; and the humor took them till, like birds"
11115,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"That sing among the spice-trees and the palms,"
11116,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,The garden pealed with maiden merriment.
11117,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11118,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Then quoth the princess, ""Thou wilt wed with him,"
11119,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Ansada?"" mirth in her gazelle-like eyes,"
11120,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And gravity sage-solemn in her speech;
11121,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And took Ansada's hand and laid it in
11122,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"The old man's staggering hand, and he unbent"
11123,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,His crookéd back and on his staff arose
11124,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Wrinkled and weighed with many heavy years,"
11125,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And kissed her, leaning on his shaking staff,"
11126,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And heaped her bosom with an Amir's wealth,"
11127,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And left them laughing at his foolish beard.
11128,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Now on the next day, as she took her ease"
11129,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"With her glad troop of girlhood,--maidens who"
11130,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"So many royal tulips seemed,--behold,"
11131,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Bowed with white years, upon a flowery sward"
11132,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,The ancient with new jewelry and gems
11133,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Wherefrom the sun coaxed wizard fires and lit
11134,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Glimmers in glowing green and pendent pearl,"
11135,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Ultramarine and beaded, vivid rose."
11136,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And so they stood and wondered; and one asked,"
11137,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"As yesternoon, wherefore the father there"
11138,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Displayed his Sheikh locks and the genie gems.--
11139,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""Another marriage and another kiss?--"
11140,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,What! doth the tomb-ripe court his youth again?
11141,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"O aged one, libertine in hope not deed!"
11142,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,O prodigal of wives as well as wealth!
11143,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Here stands thy damsel,"" trilled the Peri-tall"
11144,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Diarra with the midnight in her hair,"
11145,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Two lemon-blossoms blowing in her cheeks;
11146,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And took the dotard's jewels with the kiss
11147,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,In merry mockery.
11148,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11149,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Ere the morrow's dawn
11150,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Bethought Eddetma: ""Shall my handmaidens,"
11151,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Humoring a gray-beard's whim, for wrinkled smiles"
11152,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And withered kisses still divide his wealth?
11153,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"While I stand idle, lose the caravan"
11154,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Whose least is notable?--I too will wed,"
11155,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Betide me what betides."""
11156,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,
11157,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And with the morn
11158,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Before the man,--for privily she came,--"
11159,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Stood habited, as were her tire-maids,"
11160,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,In humbler raiment. Now the ancient saw
11161,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And knew her for the princess that she was,"
11162,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And kindling gladness of the knowledge made
11163,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Two sparkling forges of his deep-set eyes
11164,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Beneath the ashes of his priestly brows.
11165,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Not timidly she came; but coy approach
11166,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,Became a maiden of Eddetma's suite.
11167,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"She, gazing on the jewels he had spread"
11168,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Beneath the rose-bower by the fountain, said:--"
11169,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""The princess gave me leave, O grandfather."
11170,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Here is my hand in marriage, here my lips."
11171,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Adorn thy bride; then grant me my divorce."""
11172,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"And humbly answered he, ""With all my heart!""--"
11173,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Responsive to her quavering request,--"
11174,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"""The daughter of the king did give thee leave?"
11175,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And thou wouldst wed?--Then let us not delay.--
11176,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Thy hand! thy lips!"" So he arose and heaped"
11177,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Her with barbaric jewelry and gems,"
11178,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And took her hand and from her lips the kiss.
11179,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Then from his age, behold, the dotage fell,"
11180,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,And from the man all palsied hoariness.
11181,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Victorious-eyed and amorous, a youth,"
11182,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"A god in ardent capabilities,"
11183,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Resistless held her; and she, swooning, saw,"
11184,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Transfigured and triumphant bending o'er,"
11185,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,"Gloating, the branded brow of Prince Behram."
11186,BEHRAM AND EDDETMA,

11191,TORQUEMADA,
11192,TORQUEMADA,_To the Chapter of the Archbishop of Toledo._
11193,TORQUEMADA,
11194,TORQUEMADA,
11195,TORQUEMADA,"What doth the Archbishop, his chapter of"
11196,TORQUEMADA,Toledo?--Yea! doze they above some Bull--
11197,TORQUEMADA,Some dull dry Bull Pope Sextus sent to rot?
11198,TORQUEMADA,"Come, come! awake! O prelates militant!"
11199,TORQUEMADA,Hear me! this is a truth I whisper now:
11200,TORQUEMADA,Spain's King is less than king as I am less
11201,TORQUEMADA,Than Paul the Apostle.--Look you! look around;
11202,TORQUEMADA,"Observe and dare!--I write above my seal,"
11203,TORQUEMADA,"A grave Dominican, to postulate"
11204,TORQUEMADA,"Pacheco, Marquis de Villena, croaks"
11205,TORQUEMADA,No nonsense in your excellencies' ears:
11206,TORQUEMADA,King Henry's heir _is_ illegitimate!
11207,TORQUEMADA,"Blanche of Navarre cast off, his Impotence"
11208,TORQUEMADA,Gave us a wanton out of Portugal
11209,TORQUEMADA,"For Queen; Joanna, who bore him this heir"
11210,TORQUEMADA,"The cuckold King parades, a bastard, now."
11211,TORQUEMADA,Look! all the Court laughs--secretly: but masks
11212,TORQUEMADA,Are but for slaves; the people's smile is free
11213,TORQUEMADA,From all concealment; and the word still wags
11214,TORQUEMADA,"About this son,--who is his favorite's,"
11215,TORQUEMADA,"Bertrand la Cueva's, handsome exquisite,--"
11216,TORQUEMADA,"Whom, people say,--and what they say is true,--"
11217,TORQUEMADA,"The King himself, needing a lusty heir,"
11218,TORQUEMADA,Made warm familiar with Joanna's bed.
11219,TORQUEMADA,What shall we do? endorse the infamy?
11220,TORQUEMADA,Absolve them?--Yea! absolve them--at the stake!
11221,TORQUEMADA,"Or, if not that, then with the axe that hews"
11222,TORQUEMADA,"The neck of State asunder!--Is it well,"
11223,TORQUEMADA,Prelates and ministers?
11224,TORQUEMADA,
11225,TORQUEMADA,Be merciful?--
11226,TORQUEMADA,"Lest the disease of this delicious fruit,"
11227,TORQUEMADA,"This Kingdom of Castile, corrode the core,"
11228,TORQUEMADA,Why not pare off all rottenness and leave
11229,TORQUEMADA,"The healthy pulp! The throne, the populace,"
11230,TORQUEMADA,"The Church, and God demand the overthrow,"
11231,TORQUEMADA,Deponement or the abnegation of
11232,TORQUEMADA,"This Henry, named the Fourth, the impotent!--"
11233,TORQUEMADA,Alphonso lives.... (It is my guarded hope
11234,TORQUEMADA,That brothers of such kings have no long life.)--
11235,TORQUEMADA,Am I impatient? 'Tis the tonsure then;
11236,TORQUEMADA,Ambition ever was and aye will be
11237,TORQUEMADA,"Cousined to fierce impatience. 'Tis the cowl,"
11238,TORQUEMADA,"The tonsure and the cowl, _they_ must advance!"
11239,TORQUEMADA,"My native town, Valladolid, did sow"
11240,TORQUEMADA,"The priestly germ, ambition, first in me;"
11241,TORQUEMADA,"Rather 'twas planted there in me; and had,"
11242,TORQUEMADA,"Despite the richness of the soil, poor growth"
11243,TORQUEMADA,And less encouragement; the nipping wind
11244,TORQUEMADA,Of Court disfavor was too much for it;
11245,TORQUEMADA,"And so I bore it thence to Cordova,"
11246,TORQUEMADA,"And sunned its torpor in a woman's smile,"
11247,TORQUEMADA,'Neath which it sprouted but--who trusts the sex?--
11248,TORQUEMADA,Grew to a tenderness too insecure
11249,TORQUEMADA,"For love's black frosts. Required hardiness,"
11250,TORQUEMADA,And found it there at Zaragossa; (where
11251,TORQUEMADA,"Fat father Lopés, bluff Dominican,"
11252,TORQUEMADA,"My youth confuted with wise nonsense, and"
11253,TORQUEMADA,Astonished Spain in disputation in
11254,TORQUEMADA,The public controversies of the monks).
11255,TORQUEMADA,"Transplanted to the Court, oh, splendid speed!"
11256,TORQUEMADA,Sure hath its growth been. Now a Cardinal's red
11257,TORQUEMADA,Is promised by the bud that tops its stem.
11258,TORQUEMADA,"How have I, through the saintly medium"
11259,TORQUEMADA,"Of the confessional, impressed the ear"
11260,TORQUEMADA,"Of Isabella, daughter and dear child!"
11261,TORQUEMADA,"The incarnation of my dear ideal,"
11262,TORQUEMADA,"Pure crucifix of my religious love,"
11263,TORQUEMADA,Sweet cross which my ambition guards and holds:
11264,TORQUEMADA,Ploughed up the early meadows of her soul
11265,TORQUEMADA,For fruitful increase! in her maiden heart
11266,TORQUEMADA,Insinuated subtleties of seed
11267,TORQUEMADA,Shall ripen to a queen crowned with a crown
11268,TORQUEMADA,From welded gold of Arragon and Castile!
11269,TORQUEMADA,"How I this son of John, the Second named,"
11270,TORQUEMADA,"Prince Ferdinand of swarthy Arragon,--"
11271,TORQUEMADA,"(Grant absolution, holy mother mine!"
11272,TORQUEMADA,Thus thy advancement and thy mastery
11273,TORQUEMADA,Would I obtain!)--have on her fancy limned
11274,TORQUEMADA,In morning colors of proud chivalry!
11275,TORQUEMADA,Till he a sceptered paladin of love
11276,TORQUEMADA,"And beaming manhood stands! She dreams, she dreams"
11277,TORQUEMADA,"What--Heaven knows! 'Tis, haply, of a star"
11278,TORQUEMADA,She saw when but a babe and in the arms
11279,TORQUEMADA,"Of some old nurse. A star, that laughed above"
11280,TORQUEMADA,A space of Moorish balcony that hung
11281,TORQUEMADA,Above a water full of upset stars;
11282,TORQUEMADA,Reflected glimmers of old palace fêtes:
11283,TORQUEMADA,"A star she reached for, cried for, claimed her own,"
11284,TORQUEMADA,"But never got; that blew young promises,"
11285,TORQUEMADA,"Court promises, centupled, from the tips"
11286,TORQUEMADA,Of golden fingers at her infant eyes.--
11287,TORQUEMADA,"Well! when this girl is grown to be a queen,"
11288,TORQUEMADA,"What if one, Torquemada, clothe her star"
11289,TORQUEMADA,In palpable approach and give it her!--
11290,TORQUEMADA,
11291,TORQUEMADA,"When she is Queen, three steadfast purposes"
11292,TORQUEMADA,Have grown their causes to divine results.--
11293,TORQUEMADA,No young imagination did I train
11294,TORQUEMADA,With such endeavor and for no reward.--
11295,TORQUEMADA,How often have I told her of the things
11296,TORQUEMADA,"She could perform when Queen, while silently"
11297,TORQUEMADA,"And pensively she sat and, leaning, heard,"
11298,TORQUEMADA,"Absorbed upon my face! her missal,--crushed"
11299,TORQUEMADA,"By one propped elbow, its bent, careless leaves"
11300,TORQUEMADA,Rich with illuminated capitals
11301,TORQUEMADA,"Of gold and purple,--open on her lap."
11302,TORQUEMADA,"Long, long we sat thus, brothers, speaking of"
11303,TORQUEMADA,Felicity; discoursing earnestly
11304,TORQUEMADA,Of Earth and Heaven; and of who adhere
11305,TORQUEMADA,To God's true Vicar and our Holy Church:
11306,TORQUEMADA,"Beatitude and all the ceaseless bliss,"
11307,TORQUEMADA,"Celestial, of eternal Paradise,"
11308,TORQUEMADA,As everlasting as the souls that have
11309,TORQUEMADA,Built a strong tower for the only Faith.
11310,TORQUEMADA,"And I recall now how, in exhortation,"
11311,TORQUEMADA,Filled with the fervor of my cause I cried:--
11312,TORQUEMADA,"""Walk not on ways that lead but to despair,"
11313,TORQUEMADA,The easy ways of Satan! Rather thorns
11314,TORQUEMADA,For naked feet that will not falter if
11315,TORQUEMADA,"Retentive of the arm of our true Church,"
11316,TORQUEMADA,Who comforts weariness with promises
11317,TORQUEMADA,Still urging onward; and refreshes hearts
11318,TORQUEMADA,"With whisperings in the tuneless ear of Care.""--"
11319,TORQUEMADA,"And oft, big-eyed with innocence, she asked,"
11320,TORQUEMADA,"""Do some digress?""--And I, ""Yea, many! yea!"
11321,TORQUEMADA,"And there's necessity! we should annul,"
11322,TORQUEMADA,"Pluck forth the canker that contaminates,"
11323,TORQUEMADA,Corrodes the milk-white beauty of our Rose.--
11324,TORQUEMADA,God's persecution! they confront our Faith
11325,TORQUEMADA,With brows of stigmatizing error writ
11326,TORQUEMADA,In Hell's red handwriting. Shall such persist?
11327,TORQUEMADA,"No!--Heaven demands an end to all this shame!""--"
11328,TORQUEMADA,"Her pledge she gave me then: ""When Queen, for Spain"
11329,TORQUEMADA,The Inquisition! Let the Saints record!
11330,TORQUEMADA,"I promise thee, my father, thou shalt be"
11331,TORQUEMADA,A mattock of deracination to
11332,TORQUEMADA,"Extirpate heresy."""
11333,TORQUEMADA,
11334,TORQUEMADA,"Well, well; time goes:"
11335,TORQUEMADA,"The world moves onward, and I still am--oh,"
11336,TORQUEMADA,"Frere Torquemada, a Dominican!..."
11337,TORQUEMADA,
11338,TORQUEMADA,"Blind Spain hastes blindly forward, eager for"
11339,TORQUEMADA,Her Hellward plunge. Our need is absolute.
11340,TORQUEMADA,Conclusion to these monster heresies
11341,TORQUEMADA,"Or their most imminent consequence!--The throne,"
11342,TORQUEMADA,"Which is derived directly from high God,"
11343,TORQUEMADA,Meseems should champion God in any cause;
11344,TORQUEMADA,"And if it will not, we will make it to.--"
11345,TORQUEMADA,"O Spain, Spain, Spain! awake! arise! and crush"
11346,TORQUEMADA,These multiplying madnesses that mouth
11347,TORQUEMADA,Their paradoxes at the Cross and shriek
11348,TORQUEMADA,Their blasphemies e'en in the face of Christ!--
11349,TORQUEMADA,"O miserable Religion, is thy pride"
11350,TORQUEMADA,So fallen here! thy tenement of strength
11351,TORQUEMADA,"So powerless! Then where's security,"
11352,TORQUEMADA,"When steadfast principle is insecure,"
11353,TORQUEMADA,And God's own pillars rock and none resists?--
11354,TORQUEMADA,"But I have tempered, at a certain heat,"
11355,TORQUEMADA,A heart of womanhood; and so have wrought
11356,TORQUEMADA,The metal of a mind within the forge
11357,TORQUEMADA,"Of holy discourse, that Toledo's steel"
11358,TORQUEMADA,"Springs not more true than my reforming blade,"
11359,TORQUEMADA,Which shall carve worship to a perfect whole.--
11360,TORQUEMADA,Imperial Isabella! patroness!
11361,TORQUEMADA,Protectress of pure faith! sweet Catholic!
11362,TORQUEMADA,"Our Church's dear concern! its bell, its book,"
11363,TORQUEMADA,"Tribunal, and its godly Act of Faith!"
11364,TORQUEMADA,Hear how my soul cries out and speaks for thee!--
11365,TORQUEMADA,
11366,TORQUEMADA,"My lord and brothers, hear me and perpend:"
11367,TORQUEMADA,This need is first: to make her sceptered Queen
11368,TORQUEMADA,"Of wide Castile. To make (the second need),"
11369,TORQUEMADA,"Him, whom Ximenes, my friend Cordelier"
11370,TORQUEMADA,"Shall serve as minister, King Ferdinand,"
11371,TORQUEMADA,"Her wedded consort. And the third great need,"
11372,TORQUEMADA,"The last,--which yet is first,--to scour from Spain"
11373,TORQUEMADA,"These Moors, who make a brimstone-odious lair"
11374,TORQUEMADA,"Of that rich region of Granada, which,"
11375,TORQUEMADA,"Like some vile sore of scaly leprosy,"
11376,TORQUEMADA,Scabs Spain's fair face.
11377,TORQUEMADA,
11378,TORQUEMADA,Delay not. Let the Church
11379,TORQUEMADA,Divide attention then 'twixt heretics
11380,TORQUEMADA,And unclean Jews. So; wash her garments clean!--
11381,TORQUEMADA,King Henry falls. God and Saint Dominick
11382,TORQUEMADA,Aid our endeavor! and the Holy See
11383,TORQUEMADA,Build firm foundations!--Let the corner-stone
11384,TORQUEMADA,Of our most Holy Inquisition here
11385,TORQUEMADA,Be mortared with the blood of heretics
11386,TORQUEMADA,"That its strong structure may endure!--And he,"
11387,TORQUEMADA,"This Torquemada, the Dominican,"
11388,TORQUEMADA,"Made Grand Inquisitor and Cardinal,"
11389,TORQUEMADA,"This monk who writes you now, whose spirit feels"
11390,TORQUEMADA,"That God inspires him with His own desires,"
11391,TORQUEMADA,Shall blaze God's name in blood upon the world.
