30,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
31,PREFACE.,
32,PREFACE.,
33,PREFACE.,"""Amber"" was not to be classed with any society or any creed. In all"
34,PREFACE.,respects she was an individual. In good-humored contempt she held all
35,PREFACE.,"form, and with deep sincerity she revered all simple things. She smiled"
36,PREFACE.,upon error and frowned upon pretense. Her life was largely made up of
37,PREFACE.,"impulse and sacrifice. She was the constant ""victim"" of her own"
38,PREFACE.,"generosity, needing the money and the time which sympathy impelled her"
39,PREFACE.,"to give away. She was so devoted a lover of the moods of nature, noting"
40,PREFACE.,so closely the changing of the leaf or a new note sounded by the
41,PREFACE.,"whimsical wind, that her spirit itself must once have been an October"
42,PREFACE.,"day. Year after year she toiled, and her reward was not money, but a"
43,PREFACE.,"letter from the bedside of the invalid, telling of a heart that had been"
44,PREFACE.,"lightened, of a care that had been driven from the door. None of the"
45,PREFACE.,newspaper writers of Chicago was more popular. Another column told the
46,PREFACE.,news of the day; her column held the news of the heart. Her best
47,PREFACE.,thoughts and warmest fancies are scattered throughout her prose. Her
48,PREFACE.,"verses are pleasant, and many of them are striking, but meter often"
49,PREFACE.,"chained her fancy. But some of her unchained fancies, poetic conceits in"
50,PREFACE.,"the guise of prose, will live long after the clasp, holding the"
51,PREFACE.,"pretentious verses of a society laureate, shall have been eaten loose by"
52,PREFACE.,the constant nibble of time.
53,PREFACE.,
54,PREFACE.,"When a church was crowded with friends, come to bid ""Amber"" good-bye, a"
55,PREFACE.,"great thinker, a writer who knows the meaning of toil, said that she had"
56,PREFACE.,succeeded by the force and the industry of her genius. And so she had.
57,PREFACE.,"For others, influence searched out easy places, but ""Amber"" found her"
58,PREFACE.,"own hard place and maintained it, struggling alone. Her words were for"
59,PREFACE.,"the poor and the sorrowful, and they could but give a blessing. But in"
60,PREFACE.,"the end, a blessing from the poor may be brighter than the silver of the"
61,PREFACE.,rich.

73,I WONDER.,I WONDER.
74,I WONDER.,
75,I WONDER.,"I wonder, if I died to-night,"
76,I WONDER.,"And you should hear to-morrow,"
77,I WONDER.,You'd mourn to think this one dear friend
78,I WONDER.,Had bid good-bye to sorrow.
79,I WONDER.,
80,I WONDER.,"I wonder, if you saw a bird,"
81,I WONDER.,"The hunter's dart outflying,"
82,I WONDER.,You'd lure it back with loving word
83,I WONDER.,"To danger, pain, and dying."
84,I WONDER.,
85,I WONDER.,"I wonder, if you saw a rose,"
86,I WONDER.,"Plucked quick in June's surrender,"
87,I WONDER.,"You'd wish it back upon the bough,"
88,I WONDER.,To wither in November.
89,I WONDER.,
90,I WONDER.,"I wonder, if you watched the moon,"
91,I WONDER.,"The tempest's rack outstripping,"
92,I WONDER.,You'd grieve to see its silver prow
93,I WONDER.,In cloudless ether dipping.
94,I WONDER.,
95,I WONDER.,"I wonder, if you heard a thrush"
96,I WONDER.,"Laugh out amid the clover,"
97,I WONDER.,You'd weep because its cage door oped--
98,I WONDER.,Its captive days were over.
99,I WONDER.,
100,I WONDER.,"I wonder, if, some happy day,"
101,I WONDER.,"When you have found your haven,"
102,I WONDER.,You'll mourn to find this one dear friend
103,I WONDER.,Had been so long in heaven.

106,I WONDER.,
107,I WONDER.,When I die bury me by the sea. Let my first hundred years in the spirit
108,I WONDER.,be spent on a sunny sand-bank watching the sapphire tides break over a
109,I WONDER.,bluff of lifted rocks. What is any earthly trouble but a dissolving
110,I WONDER.,"dream, when one may bury the face in golden moss and sniff the salt"
111,I WONDER.,"spume of the sea! Over the blue verge of the horizon lies Spain, and I"
112,I WONDER.,build its castles hourly here in my heart. A distant echo rings in my
113,I WONDER.,"ears of trucks driven over stony streets, of the crack of the cabman's"
114,I WONDER.,"whip and the shout of profane teamsters, but the only semblance to cruel"
115,I WONDER.,driver and jaded beast of burden seen in the seaside paradise of which I
116,I WONDER.,write is a fat huckster and a still fatter donkey who draws the large
117,I WONDER.,"man where he (the donkey) listeth. Here on this lifted moorland, if one"
118,I WONDER.,wishes to go anywhere he rises up and goes forth on a carpet of crimson
119,I WONDER.,moss and yellow grass and is driven by a chariot of untired winds.
120,I WONDER.,Behind us are miles of purple moss swept by ragged shreds of September
121,I WONDER.,"fog, and musical, here and there, with bells of grazing herds; while"
122,I WONDER.,"before us, behind us, and all around us stretches the boundless,"
123,I WONDER.,unfathomable and mysterious sea.
124,I WONDER.,
125,I WONDER.,*       *       *       *       *
126,I WONDER.,
127,I WONDER.,Did you ever hear of the island of Avilion? That enchanted place where
128,I WONDER.,"""falls not hail, or rain, nor ever wind blows loudly,"" whose orchard"
129,I WONDER.,lands and bowery hollows lie lapsed in summer seas? I found it one day
130,I WONDER.,when I was sailing on Casco bay in a boat hardly bigger than a peanut
131,I WONDER.,"shell. Tennyson found it long ago in a dream, and to it he sent the good"
132,I WONDER.,"King Arthur that he might ""heal him of his grievous wound"" within the"
133,I WONDER.,"balm of its heavenly peace. But I found it in reality, and to it I took"
134,I WONDER.,"a care-worn lady and a work-weary brain, that I might perchance renew"
135,I WONDER.,under its sunny spell a strength that was well-nigh spent. I found my
136,I WONDER.,"island under another name, to be sure, but I rechristened it within the"
137,I WONDER.,"first hour of my landing. It is not the place, my dear, for featherheads"
138,I WONDER.,"and butterflies, this island of Avilion. It is not the place for the"
139,I WONDER.,descendants of Flora McFlimsy to go with their new gowns and their
140,I WONDER.,"French heels. All such would vote my little island a bore, and run up a"
141,I WONDER.,flag for the first inland-bound steamer to put into port and carry them
142,I WONDER.,"away. It has no ball-room, no promenade-hall under cover, no brass band,"
143,I WONDER.,"no merry-go-round, but instead it has meadow-lands that are brimful of"
144,I WONDER.,bird songs; it has wild strawberries that bring their ruby wine to the
145,I WONDER.,very lips of the laughing sea; it has such sunsets as visit the dreams
146,I WONDER.,of poets and the skies of Italy; it has great rocks that are woven all
147,I WONDER.,"over with webs of wild convolvulus vine, whose airy goblets of pink and"
148,I WONDER.,blue hold nectar for the booming bee to sip; and it has marguerite
149,I WONDER.,"daisies by the tens of thousands, and wild roses that carry the tint of"
150,I WONDER.,your baby's palm and the honey of sugar-sweet dew within the inclosure
151,I WONDER.,"of their small curled cup. It is hardly bigger than a Cunarder, this"
152,I WONDER.,"little Chebeague island, whose name I changed to Avilion, and from"
153,I WONDER.,wave-washed keel to flowery bowsprit the eye never lights upon a
154,I WONDER.,defilement or a stain. It is the only place in all my wanderings where I
155,I WONDER.,never found a peanut shell nor a tin can thrown out to defile nature's
156,I WONDER.,beauty.
157,I WONDER.,
158,I WONDER.,There was not a single bad odor on my island during the whole ten days
159,I WONDER.,"of my tarrying, and I am told by those who are old inhabitants that"
160,I WONDER.,"such a thing never was known to it. A soft wind is always blowing, but"
161,I WONDER.,the only merchandise it carries is wild thyme perfume and the fragrant
162,I WONDER.,airs that waft from meadow-lands and old-fashioned gardens full of spice
163,I WONDER.,pinks and cinnamon roses. Now and then a hunter's fog slips the leash of
164,I WONDER.,"its viewless hounds and with noiseless ""halloo"" scours the island for"
165,I WONDER.,the prey it tracks but seems never to corral. Now and then a sudden
166,I WONDER.,tumult seizes the tides that climb and fall on the shiny rocks and the
167,I WONDER.,air is full of the throb of soft drums and the music of flutes that are
168,I WONDER.,"beat and blown a moment, then die away as quickly as they came, like a"
169,I WONDER.,"strolling band that marches through a village street, then over the"
170,I WONDER.,hills and far away. Now and then a troop of crows rise silently from out
171,I WONDER.,the shadow of the pines and go sailing between the lazy eyes that follow
172,I WONDER.,"and the sun, until, settling down upon some meadow stacked with new-cut"
173,I WONDER.,"hay, they break into clamorous laughter that taunts you with its shrill"
174,I WONDER.,"derision. Always, from dawn to dewfall, the world about little Chebeague"
175,I WONDER.,is full of swallows that dart and soar and flit like shadows. They
176,I WONDER.,"seldom sing, and yet the few notes they thread upon the air sparkle like"
177,I WONDER.,"diamonds where they fall. Some strange bird, with a low, sleepy song"
178,I WONDER.,"like the crooning of a child that is half asleep, or like a shepherd"
179,I WONDER.,"boy's pipe idly blown beneath the noonday willows, is always haunting"
180,I WONDER.,the groves of Avilion with an undiscovered presence. I have spent hours
181,I WONDER.,"looking for him, yet never found him. Sometimes I have been led to half"
182,I WONDER.,believe the fellow exists only in the fancy of a spellbound idler like
183,I WONDER.,you and me.
184,I WONDER.,
185,I WONDER.,Just at sunset a little feathered violinist of the island whips out his
186,I WONDER.,"fiddle and draws the bow so delicately across its vibrant strings, while"
187,I WONDER.,"the golden sun slips tranquilly beneath the tinted waters of Casco bay,"
188,I WONDER.,that the soul of the listener is fairly attenuated like a high C
189,I WONDER.,diminuendo with the spell of so much beauty. I don't know the name of
190,I WONDER.,"the bird either, but he is going to sing for us all in heaven later on."
191,I WONDER.,Such performers do not end all here any more than Beethoven did.
192,I WONDER.,
193,I WONDER.,It was my custom during the time I spent at Little Chebeague to devote
194,I WONDER.,the entire day to strolling or lying at length upon the rocks--
195,I WONDER.,
196,I WONDER.,Nothing but me 'twixt earth and sky;
197,I WONDER.,"An emerald and an amethyst stone,"
198,I WONDER.,Hung and hollowed for me alone.
199,I WONDER.,
200,I WONDER.,"I grew to love the solitude with all my heart, and the thought of"
201,I WONDER.,returning to the mainland with its jargon and its bustle was like the
202,I WONDER.,thought of tophet to the poor little peri for whom the gate of paradise
203,I WONDER.,had swung. Sometimes I would board the small boat that two or three
204,I WONDER.,times a day threads in and out of the blue water-way and visit adjacent
205,I WONDER.,islands hardly less beautiful than my chosen home.
206,I WONDER.,
207,I WONDER.,"There is Long Island, far more beautiful by reason of its East End,"
208,I WONDER.,where as yet the tide of a full-fledged summer resort has not come.
209,I WONDER.,"There is an old-fashioned country roadhouse, such as we knew before the"
210,I WONDER.,landscape gardener and the boulevard fiend were turned loose upon our
211,I WONDER.,rural towns. To follow their windings is heaven enough for me. A fringe
212,I WONDER.,"of buttercups to fence the way, thickets of underbrush to darken the"
213,I WONDER.,"near distance, constant little ups and downs where the road slips into"
214,I WONDER.,hollow to follow the call of a romping brook or climb a hill to watch
215,I WONDER.,"for the sea. Wintergreen berries and russet patches everywhere, and the"
216,I WONDER.,snow of blackberry bushes in bloom far as the eye can travel.
217,I WONDER.,
218,I WONDER.,"""There is an old-time rail fence!"" cried a visitor from the booming west"
219,I WONDER.,"one day; ""my God, let me get out and touch it! I haven't seen anything"
220,I WONDER.,"but barbed wire since I left New England!"" And he did get out of the"
221,I WONDER.,buckboard in which he was driving and chipped away a big brown fence
222,I WONDER.,sliver as a memento. These roads I am talking about lead nowhere in
223,I WONDER.,"particular. They, as often as not, end in a fisherman's back dooryard,"
224,I WONDER.,but they are sweet as a young girl's caprice while they last.
225,I WONDER.,
226,I WONDER.,One day we strolled across one of the islands and found a battlement of
227,I WONDER.,rocks on the seaside that it would have taken a solid month to explore.
228,I WONDER.,"Oh, there was enough on the bar at ebb tide at Avilion to while away an"
229,I WONDER.,age of idle time.
230,I WONDER.,
231,I WONDER.,Sometimes we took it into our heads to ride. Then the choice lay between
232,I WONDER.,Charlie the Christian--so named for his good behavior and gentle
233,I WONDER.,"ways--and the one roadster the island produced, a nag in the rough, who"
234,I WONDER.,held his head high and cavorted with the stride of a jamboreeing boy.
235,I WONDER.,
236,I WONDER.,"The choice made, the hour must be watched to catch the low tide over to"
237,I WONDER.,"Big Chebeague, for there are no wagon roads in Avilion. Six hours of"
238,I WONDER.,"safety, as to the low water mark, is the limit of one day's riding, and"
239,I WONDER.,much can be done in the way of riding in a half-dozen hours' time. A
240,I WONDER.,"spin across the bar, the climbing of a rocky road, a sweep of"
241,I WONDER.,"seaward-facing pike, with dips into ferny hollows and ascents to"
242,I WONDER.,"pine-crowned bluffs, make the trip worth recording, and if to the"
243,I WONDER.,exhilaration of the ride you add a dismount now and then to gather
244,I WONDER.,"wintergreen and pick roses, with a loiter through a church-yard where"
245,I WONDER.,"many Hamiltons, both pre-Adamite and ante-historic, are sleeping the"
246,I WONDER.,"sleep of the just, you have the whole meaning of an afternoon outing on"
247,I WONDER.,Big Chebeague.
248,I WONDER.,
249,I WONDER.,Every evening after supper there was a pilgrimage to the west side of
250,I WONDER.,"the island, not to be dispensed with by descendants of those remnant"
251,I WONDER.,tribes that once worshiped the sun. Ranging from north to south as far
252,I WONDER.,"as the eye can sweep, from westward, fronting little Chebeague, lies"
253,I WONDER.,"Casco bay, the loveliest bit of water in all the world. I say"
254,I WONDER.,"unhesitatingly the loveliest, because I do not believe that Naples, nor"
255,I WONDER.,"Sorrento, nor any far-famed Italian watering-place can match the coast"
256,I WONDER.,"of Maine for beauty. Into this bay, like petals from a wind-shaken"
257,I WONDER.,"blossom tree, are dropped hundreds of islands. Far to the west the White"
258,I WONDER.,"mountains melt upon the horizon in airy outline of blue, and over all"
259,I WONDER.,each day is repeated the ancient miracle of the sun's decline. Sometimes
260,I WONDER.,"a single cloud, like a tomb, receives the bright embodiment of day and"
261,I WONDER.,hides it from our sight behind such draperies as orient never wrought
262,I WONDER.,nor monarch dreamed. Sometimes this fair god lies at length upon a bier
263,I WONDER.,"of purple porphyry, while flakes of crushed gems strew his couch with"
264,I WONDER.,"rainbow dust, and all the air is full of rose-red censers, edged with"
265,I WONDER.,"gold. Sometimes he drops below the verge, holding to the last a wine cup"
266,I WONDER.,brimmed with sparkling vintage that spills and trickles down the hills.
267,I WONDER.,"Sometimes he returns in an afterglow, as the dead come back to us in"
268,I WONDER.,"dreams, the tenderer and the sweeter for their second coming. However"
269,I WONDER.,"the sun may set in Avilion, each setting is the most beautiful and best"
270,I WONDER.,to be desired.
271,I WONDER.,
272,I WONDER.,*       *       *       *       *
273,I WONDER.,
274,I WONDER.,I heard someone bewailing the death of a friend the other day. The staff
275,I WONDER.,"on which he had leaned, the bread which had ministered to his needs, the"
276,I WONDER.,"very light that had filled his eyes seemed caught away, and he mourned"
277,I WONDER.,as one for whom there was no comfort possible. I saw a mother leaning
278,I WONDER.,"above an empty crib, whose dainty pillow no nestling head should ever"
279,I WONDER.,press again. I marked the terrible yet voiceless grief that ate at a
280,I WONDER.,"bereaved father's self-control, until no wind-blown reed was ever so"
281,I WONDER.,shorn of self-reliant strength. I saw a wife whose love had sunk within
282,I WONDER.,"the grave where her young husband was laid, as the sun sets within a"
283,I WONDER.,cloud of stormy night. I saw an old man bow his snowy head because the
284,I WONDER.,faithful one whose hand had lain in his for more than fifty years had
285,I WONDER.,vanished from his sight forever. I heard a little child lamenting at
286,I WONDER.,bed-time the lullaby song which its dead mother's tender lips should
287,I WONDER.,"never sing again. But sadder than all these things, more tragical than"
288,I WONDER.,any death which merely picks the blossom of life and bears it onward to
289,I WONDER.,"heaven, as the gardener plucks the choicest rose to grace some festival"
290,I WONDER.,"of joy, is the scene when a trusted friendship dies; when faith which"
291,I WONDER.,has endured the test of years gives up the breath of loyal life and
292,I WONDER.,sinks to hopeless unawakened death. Never think that you have shed your
293,I WONDER.,bitterest tears until you have stood at such a death-bed. Think not the
294,I WONDER.,measurement of any mortal grief has been found until you have sunk the
295,I WONDER.,plummet-line of such a sorrow. That grave shall never burst its sheath
296,I WONDER.,"to let the soul of friendship's betrayal free, like a lily on the Easter"
297,I WONDER.,air. That door shall never swing like the bars of a cage to let a
298,I WONDER.,murdered faith flash forth like the plume of a singing bird to seek the
299,I WONDER.,stars. Over the grave of a dead and buried trust no resurrection-note
300,I WONDER.,can ever sound like a bugle-call across the dewy hills to rouse the
301,I WONDER.,sleeper from his couch. God pity all who linger by the heaped-up mound
302,I WONDER.,"where love's forgotten dreams lie buried, and grant oblivion as the only"
303,I WONDER.,surcease for their bitter sorrow.
304,I WONDER.,
305,I WONDER.,*       *       *       *       *
306,I WONDER.,
307,I WONDER.,The days and nights swing equally upon the golden balance of time. The
308,I WONDER.,year is whitening with its crop of frost-blossoms from which no
309,I WONDER.,"harvest-home has ever yet been called. Like an unwritten page, the new"
310,I WONDER.,year lies before us in untrodden fields of shining snow. God grant the
311,I WONDER.,footsteps of Death be not the first to track the unbroken path that lies
312,I WONDER.,"before us. May joy and peace and love, like the roots of the violets"
313,I WONDER.,"under the snow, quicken and blossom for all of us as the year advances,"
314,I WONDER.,"and may our progress be, like January's, right steadily onward unto"
315,I WONDER.,June!
316,I WONDER.,
317,I WONDER.,*       *       *       *       *
318,I WONDER.,
319,I WONDER.,"As I write there is a sudden break in the hush of night, and faint and"
320,I WONDER.,"clear and sweet upon the listening ear falls the sound of ""taps"" from"
321,I WONDER.,"the camp in Fort Sheridan woods. I drop my pencil and listen to it, as I"
322,I WONDER.,"always do, with almost a spirit of reverent awe. The hard day's work is"
323,I WONDER.,"done, the time for rest has come, and over all the busy camp silence"
324,I WONDER.,"falls like the shadow of a brooding wing. The new moon, half hidden by"
325,I WONDER.,drifting clouds sends a rippling play of silver through the woodbine
326,I WONDER.,"leaves, and from the top of the maple tree, a thrush dreams forth a bar"
327,I WONDER.,"of liquid music in its sleep. All the world is going to sleep, and God"
328,I WONDER.,"grant, say I, that when the time for the final good-night has come for"
329,I WONDER.,"you and for me the call for ""taps,"" blown from some celestial bugle the"
330,I WONDER.,other side the mystic gate may fall as sweetly upon our ears and find us
331,I WONDER.,as ready to sink to slumber.
332,I WONDER.,
333,I WONDER.,*       *       *       *       *
334,I WONDER.,
335,I WONDER.,Did you ever hunt for eggs in a haymow? If you did you can remember just
336,I WONDER.,"how, with bated breath, you crept through the fragrant glooms of the old"
337,I WONDER.,"barn and searched the dusty place for nests. You can recall, perhaps,"
338,I WONDER.,the shaft of sunlight that broke through the crevice of the door and
339,I WONDER.,showed you old speckle-top in her corner. You can hear again her furious
340,I WONDER.,cackle when you dislodged her from her nest and gathered the warm eggs
341,I WONDER.,she had hovered under her wings. You remember the excitement of the
342,I WONDER.,search and the perfection of content which settled within your soul as
343,I WONDER.,you gathered the basketful of milk-white eggs upon your arm and picked
344,I WONDER.,"your way down the steep ladder which led to the main floor and ""all out"
345,I WONDER.,"doors."" Scarcely any excitement or exhilaration of later years can"
346,I WONDER.,compare with the joy of hen's-nest hunting when you were young.
347,I WONDER.,
348,I WONDER.,Did you ever go berrying? With a tin pail swinging from your wrist and
349,I WONDER.,"your oldest gown upon your back, have you climbed the hill, jumped the"
350,I WONDER.,fences and sought the side-hill pasture where the blackberries grew
351,I WONDER.,"purple in the shade? Can you recall much, in all the years that thread"
352,I WONDER.,"between that happy time and this, which can transcend the pleasure of"
353,I WONDER.,those wildwood tramps? Even now I seem to fix my eyes upon a clump of
354,I WONDER.,bushes by the old rail fence. They are domed high with verdure and show
355,I WONDER.,"dusky hollows underneath, where, my skilled eye tells me, lurk spoils"
356,I WONDER.,"fit for Bacchus and all his nymphs. I part the leaves, a snowy moth"
357,I WONDER.,"flutters out of the green dusk and wavers like a snowflake in the warm,"
358,I WONDER.,sweet air. I carefully reach my hand away inside the fairy bower of
359,I WONDER.,crumpled leaf and twisted vine and draw it forth purple with the juice
360,I WONDER.,"of overripe berries that dissolve at a touch. With these I fill my pail,"
361,I WONDER.,"and all too often, I blush to own it, my mouth also, until twilight"
362,I WONDER.,"sends me home saturated with sunshine, late clover blooms and berry"
363,I WONDER.,juice.
364,I WONDER.,
365,I WONDER.,"Ah, my dear, all this was fun while it lasted, but there is a more"
366,I WONDER.,"exciting quest than hunting eggs or finding berries, in which we all of"
367,I WONDER.,us engage as the years of our mortal pilgrimage go hurrying by. It is
368,I WONDER.,the search for happiness--a search we never give up nor grow too old to
369,I WONDER.,maintain. Forgetting the disappointments and the satieties of the dead
370,I WONDER.,"years, we look forward to the new as the hidden nestfull of unchipped"
371,I WONDER.,"shells of fresh experience and untried delights. God bless us all, and"
372,I WONDER.,prosper us to find the eggs and the berries before we die. Perhaps the
373,I WONDER.,service of love we do others shall prove the bush that bears the
374,I WONDER.,"sweetest and the ripest clusters, and the nestfull that shall develop"

403,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
404,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"A town that was builded on the borders of a stream,"
405,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,By the loving hands of nature when she woke from winter's dream;
406,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Sunbeams for the workingmen taking turns with showers,"
407,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Rearing fairy houses of fairy grass and flowers.

409,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Crowds of talking bumblebees, rushing up and down,"
410,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Wily little brokers of this busy little town,"

432,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,that we may post ourselves as to word derivations and root meanings? As
433,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,well send a child to a botanist to find the meaning of a rose! To fitly
434,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"understand the true significance of Easter time, find some slope in"
435,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,early April that the sun has found a few short days before you. Lay your
436,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"ear close to the ground that you may hear the fine, soft stir within the"
437,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,bosom of the warm earth. Note how the mold is filling with its new birth
438,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,of flowers. There is not a covert in all the awakening woods that has
439,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,not a little nestling head hidden behind the dead leaves. The breath of
440,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,a sleeping child is not more peaceful than the sway of the wind flower
441,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,upon its downy stem. The flush on a baby's cheek is not more delicate
442,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,than the tint of each gossamer petal. To what shall we liken the grass
443,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,blades already springing up along the loosened water ways? To fairy
444,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"bowmen, led by Robin Hood's ghost through winding ways from forest on to"
445,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the sparkling sea. To what shall we liken the violet buds spread thick
446,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,beneath the country children's feet? To constant thoughts of God that
447,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,bloom even in the grave's dark dust. To what shall we liken the
448,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,twinkling leaves that shine in the dim depths of the woods? To lights
449,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"at sea, that tell some fleet is sailing into port. To what shall we"
450,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,liken the shy unfolding of the lilac buds? To the poise of a slender
451,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,maiden who leans from out her lattice to hearken to a lover's song. To
452,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,what shall we liken the cowslip's valiant gold? To the shining of a
453,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,contented spirit with a humble home. To what shall we liken the brooding
454,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,sky and the warmth of the all-loving sun? To the potency of a gentle
455,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"nature intent on doing good, and the yearning of a tender heart to bless"
456,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,and save. Is there a nook so dark and forbidding that the beautiful
457,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Easter sunshine cannot enter and woo forth a flower? Is there a rock so
458,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,impervious that the April wind may not find lodgment for a seed in some
459,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"crevice, and there uplift a bannered blossom? Is there a cold, resentful"
460,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,bank wherein the late snow lingers that shall not finally cast off its
461,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,disdainful ice and flash into verdure in response to the patient shining
462,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,of the sun? Is there a grave in all the land so new and desolate that
463,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Easter time cannot find a violet among its clods and paint a rainbow
464,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"within the tears that rain above it? To nature's lovers, then, as to the"
465,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"truly Christian heart, the significance of Easter is found in the"
466,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,reviving garden and in the awakening woods. It means resurrection after
467,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"death, blossom time after the bareness of woe, the cuckoo's cry after"
468,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"the silence of songless days, and the smile of a pitying All-Father"
469,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,after the orphan time of the soul's bereavement and seeming desertion.
470,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
471,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Another blessed thought to be gained in the contemplation of nature's
472,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"sure awakening from the long lethargy of her winter's sleep is that,"
473,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"however fearful we may be that death's reign shall be eternal, as"
474,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"constant as day dawn after midnight, or shining after storm, shall be"
475,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the Easter of the soul. We do not need to pray for April; it comes. Nor
476,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,do we need to pray for release from the first dark dominion of fear and
477,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,dread when our beloved are snatched from our arms. Such experience is
478,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"only the transient reign of winter in the heart, while yet the soft wing"
479,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,of April stirs upon the horizon's misty verge and the promise of violets
480,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,is in the lingering darkness of the air. Remember this: The same power
481,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"that sends us November is planning an April to follow, and out of the"
482,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,snowfall evolves the whiteness of the annunciation lily.
483,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
484,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"It has always seemed to me that, beautiful as Christ's birthday ought to"
485,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,be and full of tender significance as we may make the hallowed Christmas
486,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"time, a deeper tenderness attaches to these Easter days. The Sinless One"
487,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,had lived out the span of his mortal years; he had suffered and been
488,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"betrayed; had struggled through Gethsemane, up to the thorn-crowned"
489,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"heights of Calvary, and yet, through all, carried the whiteness of a"
490,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"saintly soul, to cast its dying petals, like a white rose, wind-shaken"
491,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"yet yielding perfume even in death, in the utterance of that prayer for"
492,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"universal forgiveness, the most wonderful that ever ascended from earth"
493,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"to heaven--""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do!"" The"
494,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,song that ushered in the birthtime of those sanctified years was an
495,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"invocation of peace and good will, beneath which the morning stars were"
496,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"shaken like banners before the oncoming of a glorious prince, but the"
497,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,prayer that ascended from Calvary was the plea of a betrayed and
498,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,anguished soul for universal charity and forgiveness from God to man.
499,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Let us rejoice, then, when Christmas days bring gladness to our hearts"
500,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"and homes, but let us forgive and bless when Easter lays its stainless"
501,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,lily at our feet. There is constant need for charity and forgiveness in
502,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,a world so full of self-blinded and ignorant evil-doers. They do not
503,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"always know what they do, these rude and riotous betrayers of Christ;"
504,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"and all the more need, then, for compassion, and that divine pity that,"
505,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"even from the cross, could invoke heaven's pardoning love."
506,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
507,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"If you have a friend who has wronged you, forgive him to-day, for"
508,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Christ's sweet sake. If you have a boy who has gone astray, reach out"
509,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"your arm and win him back, while yet the Easter violets glow upon the"
510,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"chancel rail. If you have a daughter who has been undutiful, take her in"
511,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,your arms and ask God to forgive you both--you for your lack of
512,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"sympathy, as well as her for her waywardness. So shall you understand"
513,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"the meaning of Easter, the resurrection time of love, the fulfillment of"
514,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,its promise from out the icy negation of the grave.
515,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
516,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,A few thoughts about death before we turn to other symbolizations of the
517,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"season. It is all a mistake, it seems to me, to make death a menace and"
518,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,a dread in the minds of the young. Does the farmer go forth with tears
519,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,to plant the seed for the coming harvest? Does the scientist mourn above
520,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the chrysalis that lets a rare butterfly go free? Does the navigator
521,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,rebel when a bark that has been tempest-tossed and storm-driven enters
522,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,port? Teach the children that death is all that makes life endurable;
523,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"that it is the sheaf of ripened wheat, or the budding flower, plucked"
524,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"from the earth's dark mold; that it is the flight of the bird, the home"
525,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"stretch of the yacht. We love each other, but what is it that makes"
526,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,human love any nobler than the chirruping of birds if not its duration?
527,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,And it is only death that makes our loves immortal. Time enthrals them
528,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,with fear and environs them with alarms; death lifts them into the
529,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,region of eternal joy. Take away the reality of our faith in the life to
530,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,come and Easter would mean no more to us than it means to the browsing
531,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,cattle that munch the violet buds and trample the bright promises of the
532,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"year under foot. The comforting view of it all is, that here we are only"
533,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"learning to love. We are like birds that sit upon the edge of the nest,"
534,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"and flutter, and chirp, and dread to fly away. What shall the bough"
535,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,whereon our nest was rocked with many a storm be when we have learned
536,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,to spread these tiresome wings and rejoice in the blue space of the
537,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"boundless air? The heroism of love, the faithfulness of love, the"
538,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"grandeur, patience and magnificence of love shall only be revealed when"
539,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the soul has left the shadows and spread its wing in the empyrean of
540,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,heaven's blue.

544,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,There is a small boy who lives at our house with whom I wage an unending
545,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,warfare on the subject of clean hands. The sun never goes down nor yet
546,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,arises upon a harmonious adjustment of the mooted question. There are
547,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"more tears shed, more dire threats made, more promises broken, more"
548,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,anguish endured on that one account than upon any other under the sun.
549,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
550,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,The boy dwells under a ban as somber as the seven-fold curse of Rome.
551,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"His sisters nag him, his grandmother prays for him, his mother pleads"
552,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"with him, his girl friends flout him, but in spite of all he continues"
553,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,to wear his hands in half tints. But the other evening he made an

555,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"rather see you with your soiled hands than see you such a dude as that!"""
556,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
557,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""Gee!"" said the boy, ""but some of the kids that go to our school are"

559,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
560,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""Don't use so much slang,"" cried his mother; ""why can't you call a boy a"
561,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"boy as well as a 'kid' and a 'duck'; and whatever do you mean by 'Gee'?"""
562,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
563,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""They bring little cushions to school,"" continued the boy with only a"
564,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"swift hug in answer to his mother's question, ""and they put 'em under"
565,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"their hands when they play marbles, so's they won't get their hands"

567,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
568,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,And in spite of her desire to see him a bit more solicitous
569,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,as to personal elegance his mother could but echo the boy's
570,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,self-congratulatory remark.
571,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
572,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,What on earth is going to become of us if this awful wave of effeminacy

575,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"their best to make molly coddles out of men, but when we are starting a"
576,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,generation of boys to play marbles with cushions to rest their hands on
577,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the sex had better abolish hats and trousers and take to hoods and
578,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,shoulder shawls. Give me a boy and not a pocket edition of an old woman.
579,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"He need not be a tough nor a bully, nor need he be cruel nor untender"

584,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,show the gentleman that's in him by never appearing at table looking
585,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"like a tramp. Even that is better, though, than being a ""sissy."" Give"
586,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,him time and the untidiest boy in the world will develop into a

592,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"As I was walking down Dearborn street the other day, close upon the"
593,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"gloaming, I chanced to meet two pretty girls, not the only two in this"
594,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"big city, perhaps, but two of the fairest. One had hair like the tassel"
595,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,of ripe corn when the sunshine finds it; the other's head was crowned
596,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"with dusky braids, and the eyes of the two were brimful of laughter as a"
597,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,goblet new-filled with wine. Surely such pretty girls should carry
598,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"queenly hearts, thought I, and with my old trick of catching topics in"
599,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"the air, I loitered a little on my way to hear what such fair lips might"
600,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"be saying. Said one: ""I really don't care to marry him; he is such a"
601,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"darned fool! but he will give me everything I want, and I suppose I"
602,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"shall."" I stayed to hear no more. If I had caught a yellow-bird"

604,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,revulsion from pleasure to disgust could not have been more sudden. Is
605,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"this all the lesson the world has taught you, my pretty maiden? To soil"
606,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,your lips with slang and sell yourself for fine clothes and the chance
607,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,of unlimited display! Forecasting the life of such a girl is like
608,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"forecasting an April day that dawns in tints of purple and gold, and"
609,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,ends in tempest and the blackness of night. Beauty is a glorious
610,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"heritage, indeed, but to see it worn by such types as you, my pretty"

619,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"as to thrill no more over Niagara Falls, let them be salted down with"

623,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,First we took our way over the bridge that leads to the beautifully kept
624,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Goat Island and, alighting from the carriage, stood for a time with the"
625,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,full splendor of the American fall in our faces. A fascination that
626,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,could not be shaken off held the eyes upon that never-stayed torrent of
627,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"sun-illumined jewels. Diamonds they were, and great uncut emeralds, with"
628,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"here and there a rain of fiery rubies, that tumbled from off the lifted"
629,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"ledge of imperishable rock. And where the volume widened, until it"
630,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"became an avalanche of snowy foam, shot through and through with needles"
631,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"of light, it seemed to us that the law of gravitation had been forever"
632,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"abandoned, and falling tons of water, losing kinship drop with drop,"
633,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,were floated skyward again to find a home in heaven. Down-shooting
634,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"rockets of silver foam unfallen, yet always in the air! Canopies of"
635,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"cloud, dissolving into fine dust-like roadside pollen! Draperies of"
636,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,spray unrolled in noiseless splendor from the blue background of an
637,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,endless day! Explosions in mid air of thunderous torrents that turned to
638,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,carded wool on the way from heaven to earth! While I stood and watched
639,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"it all somebody profaned the air with a vulgar word, and I looked for a"
640,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,flaming sword from the omnipotent hand to smite him where he stood. To
641,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"swear, or even to think an unholy thought in such a holy of holies,"
642,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,deserves the penalty of death as much as did the desecration of the
643,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,temple in ancient times.
644,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
645,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Shifting our place from point to point, we found ourselves at last"
646,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"standing on the very verge of the Horseshoe falls, where, crowned with"
647,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"living green, it slips over the crumbling ledge and loses itself in a"
648,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,dazzling whirl of spray. Although I have stood in that same spot many
649,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,times I am proud to remark that I have never stood there yet without
650,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,saying my prayers. The sight is too much for the puny ego that animates

652,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"if never before, the soul that retains one particle of the divine within"

654,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,entranced by the sublime beauty of the scene a mighty wind arose
655,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,suddenly and great clouds were called across the sky to the sending of a
656,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,swift alarm. Before the breath of the wind the mists were tumbled far
657,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"and wide like feathers, and a rainbow that arched the whole was"
658,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,demolished into nothingness only to be kindled again as a flame in the
659,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,whimsical breath of the riotous air. One moment the atmosphere was a
660,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"fairy flower garden, full of violets, roses, green feathery ferns and"
661,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,passion-tinted tulips brimming over with gold. The next some giant hand
662,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,reached forth and plucked and bore each flower away. A suffusion of
663,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"color followed every flood of sunshine, as a pomegranate runs with juice"
664,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"at the touch of a knife, only to be succeeded by pale wafts of"
665,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"colorless, interminable spray, where a cloud caught the too eager sun"

694,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"The fog was thick, the ground swell was enough to unsettle the seven"
695,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"hills of Rome, and something was wrong with the boat's machinery, so"
696,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"that for hours we lay in the trough of the sea, making no headway and"
697,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,fearful that each moment would be our last. Added to all this there came
698,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,at short intervals a demoniac blast from a fog horn which rent the air
699,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,with the clamor of a thousand tongues.
700,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
701,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""Look out!"" it seemed to shriek over and over again. ""Look out, poor"
702,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,fragile wisps of gossamer! The hour strikes for your destruction.
703,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Another wave, a little higher than the last, shall suck you down like a"
704,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,shred of foam into the blackness of the sea's dark vortex. Brace up and
705,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"meet your doom. Look out! Look out! Look out!"""
706,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
707,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"I listened to that fog horn for hours, until the soul within me lay like"
708,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"a spent bird weary with futile beating of useless wings, and I came"
709,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"within a hair's breadth of madness. In fact, I think I had commenced to"
710,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"rave a bit when a brisk wind sprang up that blew the fog away, the crew"
711,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,succeeded in righting the craft and onward we flew out of sound of the
712,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,terrible fog horn forever.
713,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
714,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,There are many things in life that remind me of fog horns; there are
715,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,many occasions that beat upon the soul with just such vociferous clamor.
716,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
717,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"There are those old-fashioned Bible texts, shouting ""hell fire"" and"
718,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""eternal damnation."" What are they but fog horns warning us from off a"
719,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,mist-enveloped shore? We cannot shut our ears to them while we lie a
720,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,furlong off the rocks and listen to their woeful reiteration. Perhaps
721,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"some chance wind may blow us out to sea, there to escape for the present"
722,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the unwelcome climax; but we know that underneath the shrouded stars and
723,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,through the hush of midnight forever and forevermore sounds the crash of
724,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"that brazen alarm. We may not heed it, but the fog horn is there, forget"
725,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,and disown it though we may.
726,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
727,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Then there are our birthdays after we grow old enough to understand
728,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,their significance; what are they but fog horns that sound at intervals
729,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,to denote that we are drawing near to the final doom of all mankind?
730,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
731,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""Sport on,"" they seem to say, ""a little longer; weave your garlands and"
732,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"blow your pretty bubbles while you may, for to-morrow you shall surely"
733,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"die!"""
734,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
735,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Each year the fog horn blows a louder blast, until finally the softened"
736,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"haze of creeping years, like a white fog in the sea air, muffles the"
737,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"sound, and we sink to rest at last, some of us with the wild clamor"
738,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,hushed to the measure of a good-night song.
739,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
740,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"Then the holidays. Thanksgivings and Christmases with independence days,"
741,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"like wine-red roses dropped between, what are they but fog horns on the"
742,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,invisible shores of memory? How they mock us with the recollection of
743,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"vanished joys, and warn us of barren years yet to be."
744,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
745,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Gone forever are the dear ones who made gala times and festival
746,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"happenings bright, and still we linger like boats in the trough of a"
747,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"sullen sea, our motive power wrecked, our sails rent, and listen,"
748,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"listen, listen to the warning that sounds from far off the hazy shore."
749,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
750,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""Gone, forever gone,"" the fog horn cries; ""gone down into the sea, the"
751,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,boats that kept you company when the bright-winged fleet put out from
752,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"port! Lost forever, in storms it seems scarce worth the while to have"
753,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"weathered, since here you toss, alone at last, like driftwood on the"
754,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"chilly tide, and listen forever to the mournful warning of my voice from"
755,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"off the sandbars, warning you that not even love can withstand the beat"
756,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"of time's relentless years."""
757,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
758,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Our desks are full of miniature fog horns in the shape of unanswered
759,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,letters.
760,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
761,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Our closets hang full of fog horns of varying fabrics. They warn us of
762,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,the folly of trusting to bargain sales of shoddy goods; they warn us
763,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,against extravagant tastes when times are hard; they warn us against the
764,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,lazy mood that neglects the stitch in time that saveth nine.
765,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
766,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Every time we are ill the occasion is a fog horn.
767,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
768,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,Either we have disregarded some law of health and are in the trough of
769,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"the sea in consequence, or we are flying on to the breakers with ears"
770,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,dulled to the fog horn's din.
771,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
772,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"We speak with cruel harshness to the old mother who loves us, or to the"
773,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"little child who trusts us. We are sorry for it afterward, and that"
774,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,sorrow is the fog horn that warns us to keep off the reef of temper.
775,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
776,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"""To-day may be the last day for the mother you have pained or the child"
777,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"you have wronged,"" it seems to say; ""the bed they lie down upon to-night"
778,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"may be the bed of death. See to it, then, that you make each day of"
779,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"life, if possible, the last day of love's opportunity."" Did you ever"
780,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,stop to think of what would become the instant concern of all this vast
781,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,human race if a sudden edict should go forth that only twenty-four hours
782,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,were left for each man to live? What if an angel should appear to-day at
783,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,sunset and proclaim in a voice that should reach from world's center to
784,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"world's rim, ""To-morrow at set of sun this globe and all its race of"
785,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,sentient life shall be folded up like a scroll and effaced from heaven's
786,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"chart!"""
787,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
788,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"What would we all begin to do then, I wonder? I think that everything"
789,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"would be forgotten but love. Envy and hatred, covetousness, jealousy,"
790,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"ambition, selfishness and cruelty would find no place in the hearts of"
791,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,men. We would improve love's latest opportunity to be kind one to
792,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"another, tender-hearted and merciful. The husband would not be harsh"
793,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"with his wife, nor the wife show waspish temper to her husband, if the"
794,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,last day had come for both. The father would not strike his boy in
795,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"uncontrolled temper, nor the mother rebuke her careless child, if the"
796,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,knowledge that the end of love's opportunity lay between the uplifted
797,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,hand and the culprit. We should all be loving and fond and sweet if we
798,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"only knew. My dear, this very thought, carried out, is but another fog"
799,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"horn. Perhaps death is already near, and the brazen clamor in our hearts"
800,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,which takes shape of an uneasy conscience or of a nameless dread is but
801,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"the warning in the fog that we are close upon the fatal reef. Ah, the"
802,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"air is full of them! They sound in every waking moment, they mingle with"
803,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"our dreams, they greet our opening eyes, they accompany us when the"
804,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,tired lids fall in slumber. The shore is lined with them and their
805,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,warning is as ceaseless as the beat of time's receding waves.
806,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
807,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,But of what use is a fog horn to a vessel that gives no heed? Why uplift
808,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,them on dangerous reefs if the ship's crew sleeps through their warning
809,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,and the unconscious captain ignores their hoarse note of alarm?
810,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,
811,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"An unheeded fog horn might as well be silenced, and so, I sometimes"
812,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"think, if we allow our hearts to grow callous to the call that"
813,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,"conscience makes, why not be thankful when the warning ceases and"
814,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,silence follows the useless repetition of an unavailing appeal? If I am
815,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,to be shipwrecked at last I think I would rather run upon the reefs
816,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,without warning than to drift to destruction to the mocking cadence of
817,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,an alarm I would not heed. To go down with the sound in my ears of an
818,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,admonition that might have saved me had I but listened would be the
819,A LITTLE GOLDENHEAD.,hardest sort of dying.

847,HER CRADLE.,"The other night, as I was listening to ""taps"" in a neighboring military"
848,HER CRADLE.,"camp, a longing came over me for a silver bugle of my own, that I might"
849,HER CRADLE.,blow a message to the drowsy world. We all listen to that fellow up at
850,HER CRADLE.,"Fort Sheridan, when he gives the command for ""lights out!"" just because"
851,HER CRADLE.,he blows it through a bugle. He might come out and say what he had to
852,HER CRADLE.,"say in tones anywhere between a cornet and a clap of thunder, and the"
853,HER CRADLE.,effect would be nothing to what it is when the notes filter through a
854,HER CRADLE.,silver mouthpiece. And how exquisitely the last strains of that nightly
855,HER CRADLE.,"call linger on the ear! They melt into the starry glooms, and throb"
856,HER CRADLE.,through the dim spaces of the woods like golden bubbles or the wavering
857,HER CRADLE.,"flight of butterflies. Whenever we hear them we think of Grant, asleep"
858,HER CRADLE.,"in his grave by the mighty river, of his work well done, and the rest"
859,HER CRADLE.,that dropped upon his pain-racked life at last like a soft and rainy
860,HER CRADLE.,shadow on a thirsty land. We think of hosts of brave men who fill
861,HER CRADLE.,soldiers' graves all over this blood-bought heritage of ours. We think
862,HER CRADLE.,"of hearts that once beat high, for long years silent as stones to all"
863,HER CRADLE.,"our cries and tears. We think of a host of things, solemn and hushed,"
864,HER CRADLE.,"and sacred, and drop to sleep at last with an indistinct purpose in our"
865,HER CRADLE.,"hearts to so conduct ourselves that when the Death Angel blows ""taps"""
866,HER CRADLE.,"for us, we shall leave a record behind us to be read through fond,"
867,HER CRADLE.,"regretful tears, and enshrined in golden characters upon the tablets of"
868,HER CRADLE.,memory.
869,HER CRADLE.,
870,HER CRADLE.,"Now, if I had a bugle instead of a pen, to work with, and if I could"
871,HER CRADLE.,stand out under the stars on a hushed summer night and deliver my
872,HER CRADLE.,"message through its silver throat, perhaps the world that reads me might"
873,HER CRADLE.,be thrilled into earnest purpose more readily than it is when exhorted
874,HER CRADLE.,from a pencil point or a quill. The first message I should ring through
875,HER CRADLE.,"that bugle of mine would be the command, ""Don't fret!"" However"
876,HER CRADLE.,"comfortless and forlorn you may be, don't add to your own and the"
877,HER CRADLE.,world's misery by fretting. There never yet was a sorrow that could not
878,HER CRADLE.,be lived down; there never yet was one that could be cured by worry.
879,HER CRADLE.,"When the cows get into the corn and the chickens into the flower-beds,"
880,HER CRADLE.,"the sensible man chases 'em out first, repairs the damage next, and,"
881,HER CRADLE.,"lastly, fastens up the break in the garden wall by which the marauders"
882,HER CRADLE.,got in. What would you think of a farmer who went into his bedroom to
883,HER CRADLE.,"pray before he chased out the cows, or of a woman who threw her apron"
884,HER CRADLE.,over her head and wept long and loud because the hens were scratching up
885,HER CRADLE.,"her pink roots, instead of ""shooing"" them a half-mile away with a broom?"
886,HER CRADLE.,Most troubles come upon us as the cattle and the hens get into the corn
887,HER CRADLE.,"and the garden patch, through a broken fence or a carelessly unguarded"
888,HER CRADLE.,"gate. It is our own fault half the time that we are tormented, and the"
889,HER CRADLE.,"sooner we repair the damage and mend the fence, the better. Time spent"
890,HER CRADLE.,"in useless bewailing, in worry and disquietude, is lost time, and while"
891,HER CRADLE.,"we wait the mischief thickens. Take life's trials one by one, as the"
892,HER CRADLE.,"handful of heroes met the host at Thermopylae, and you will slay them"
893,HER CRADLE.,all; but allow them to marshal themselves on a broad field while you are
894,HER CRADLE.,"crying over their coming or praying for deliverance, instead of arming"
895,HER CRADLE.,"yourselves to meet them, and they will make captives of you and keep"
896,HER CRADLE.,you forever in the dungeon of tears. Is your husband too poor to buy you
897,HER CRADLE.,"all the fine clothes you want, or to keep a carriage, or to surround you"
898,HER CRADLE.,"with pleasant society and congenial friends? Very well, that is"
899,HER CRADLE.,"certainly too bad, but what's the use of being forever in the dumps"
900,HER CRADLE.,"about it? Get up and help him keep the cows out of the corn, and perhaps"
901,HER CRADLE.,"you'll have a golden harvest yet. A sullen, discontented wife is a"
902,HER CRADLE.,"millstone around any man's neck, and he may be thankful when the good"
903,HER CRADLE.,Lord delivers him from her. Whatsoever is worth having in this world's
904,HER CRADLE.,"gifts is worth working for, and wedlock is like an ox-team at the plow."
905,HER CRADLE.,"If the off-ox won't pull with the nigh one, it has no claim with him"
906,HER CRADLE.,upon the possible future of a comfortable stall and a full bin. Out upon
907,HER CRADLE.,"you, then, Madam Gruntle, if you sulk, and pout and fret your days away"
908,HER CRADLE.,because your husband is a poor man and spends most of his time chasing
909,HER CRADLE.,"the cattle, calamity and failure out of his wheat patch. He may possibly"
910,HER CRADLE.,"be one of fortune's numerous ne'er-do-wells, but in that case all the"
911,HER CRADLE.,"more reason you should not fail him. Bent reeds need careful handling,"
912,HER CRADLE.,"and smoking flax gentle tending, else they will perish on your hands"
913,HER CRADLE.,and disappoint both you and heaven. All the more reason that you should
914,HER CRADLE.,"be cheery and strong and ready to do your part, if the man you married,"
915,HER CRADLE.,because you dearly loved him (remember!) is unable to do all that he
916,HER CRADLE.,"promised. That is, always provided he is weak and unfortunate, rather"
917,HER CRADLE.,than desperately wicked. A woman has no call to stand by any man if he
918,HER CRADLE.,is a wretch and shows no desire to be anything else. The Lord himself
919,HER CRADLE.,never helped a sinner until he showed some desire to be saved. Less
920,HER CRADLE.,"repining, then, a little more forbearance with one another's"
921,HER CRADLE.,"shortcomings, and a little more loyalty to the promise ""for better or"
922,HER CRADLE.,"for worse,"" will ease up much of the burden of dissatisfied and"
923,HER CRADLE.,disappointed wedlock.
924,HER CRADLE.,
925,HER CRADLE.,"Another message that I should blow through that bugle, if I had it at my"
926,HER CRADLE.,"lips to-night, would be: ""Be true!"" And I should ring it out so long and"
927,HER CRADLE.,"loud, I think, that the moon would stop to listen, and the sleepy heads"
928,HER CRADLE.,in every home in the land would rise from their pillows like
929,HER CRADLE.,"night-capped crocuses out of the snow. For heaven's sake, if you have a"
930,HER CRADLE.,"principle or a friend, be true to them. Make up your mind, whether or"
931,HER CRADLE.,"no your principle is solid and has God and justice on its side, and then"
932,HER CRADLE.,"be true to it right down to death, or, what is harder, through"
933,HER CRADLE.,"misunderstanding and obloquy. And if you have a friend, such as God"
934,HER CRADLE.,"sometimes gives a woman or a man, faithful through all betiding, staunch"
935,HER CRADLE.,"in your defense and tender in your blame, stand true to that friend"
936,HER CRADLE.,until the grave's green canopy is spread between you. He may be
937,HER CRADLE.,"unpopular and unfortunate, and all the feather-headed crew of society"
938,HER CRADLE.,"may ignore him, but if you have ever tested his worth as a friend, stand"
939,HER CRADLE.,"up for him, and stand by him forever. The sun may go down upon his"
940,HER CRADLE.,"fortunes, and calumny may cloud his name, and you may know in your heart"
941,HER CRADLE.,"that more than half the world says about him is true, but stand by the"
942,HER CRADLE.,man who has once been your true friend. Ingratitude is the blackest
943,HER CRADLE.,"crime that preys upon the human soul. The forgetfulness of a favor, or"
944,HER CRADLE.,"the effacement of a bond sealed with an obligation, is capable only to"
945,HER CRADLE.,weak and cowardly natures.
946,HER CRADLE.,
947,HER CRADLE.,"If you have a conviction, and are conscientious in the belief that you"
948,HER CRADLE.,"are right, be true to your professions. If you are a rebel, be a rebel"
949,HER CRADLE.,"out and out, and don't be a goat to leap nimbly back and forth over the"
950,HER CRADLE.,"fence. Never apologize for either your faith or your profession, unless"
951,HER CRADLE.,"you have reason to be ashamed of it; and, if you are ashamed of it,"

954,HER CRADLE.,There are lots of other messages I would like to stand on a hill and

1015,HER CRADLE.,more regretfully we should see him go. If the politician knew when to

1017,HER CRADLE.,"knew just when to die, and could opportunely bring the event about, how"
1018,HER CRADLE.,"much truer our epitaphs would be. The court fool who prayed, ""Oh God, be"

1020,HER CRADLE.,"prays, ""Oh God, teach me to know when I have said enough,"" prays deeper"

1025,HER CRADLE.,"You may talk about California all you will, but match, if you can, the"
1026,HER CRADLE.,beauty of spring as it comes to us in these northerly latitudes. There
1027,HER CRADLE.,is the coy advance and retreat of a woman hard to win; there is the

1029,HER CRADLE.,"view that glimmers and glows like an opal, or like the mirage of a misty"
1030,HER CRADLE.,"sea. I was in California a year ago, in April time. I found the month"
1031,HER CRADLE.,"that poets love in full splendor, like a queen who never doffs her"
1032,HER CRADLE.,"crown. Violets, roses, lilacs and carnations came all together in a"

1034,HER CRADLE.,"Like a matron crowned with the mid-splendor of her years, the earth"
1035,HER CRADLE.,received the homage that is due achievement. Nobody caught the sound of
1036,HER CRADLE.,the first robin on a rainy morning and heralded it with a shout; the
1037,HER CRADLE.,"first robin, like the first principle in creation, never existed, for"
1038,HER CRADLE.,the reason that he was always there. There were no foretellings of green
1039,HER CRADLE.,along the watercourses; no prophetic thrills of violets in the air; no
1040,HER CRADLE.,uplifting of the hypatica's downy head above the lattice of fuzzy
1041,HER CRADLE.,"leaves; everything was right where you discovered it, and had been all"
1042,HER CRADLE.,"the year round. Without beginning and without end, spring exists"
1043,HER CRADLE.,"forever, like a picture bound within a book, in the lovely land of the"
1044,HER CRADLE.,Gringos. But walk out some April morning in the suburbs that surround
1045,HER CRADLE.,"Chicago. Catch the tonic of the air, like wine ever so delicately"
1046,HER CRADLE.,"chilled with ice. View the lake, like a gentian flower fringed with a"
1047,HER CRADLE.,horizon fine as silk. Scrape away the leaves and hail the valiant Robin
1048,HER CRADLE.,"Hood in his suit of green, leading his legion upward to the sun. Without"
1049,HER CRADLE.,"the sound of a footfall or the gleam of a lance, they come to take"
1050,HER CRADLE.,"possession of the earth. Woo the violet to turn her dewy eye upon you,"
1051,HER CRADLE.,"and listen to the minstrel in the tower, where the winds are harping to"
1052,HER CRADLE.,"the new buds. Mark the maple twigs, like silhouettes cut in coral, and"
1053,HER CRADLE.,"the sheath of the wood lily, like a ribbon half unrolled. Rejoice in the"

1079,HER CRADLE.,What would be thought of a ship that was launched from its docks with
1080,HER CRADLE.,"flourish of music and flowing wine, built to sail the roughest and"
1081,HER CRADLE.,"deepest sea, yet manned for an unending cruise along shore? Never"
1082,HER CRADLE.,leaving harbor for dread of storm. Never swinging out of the land-girt
1083,HER CRADLE.,"bay because over the bar, the waters were deep and rough. You would say"
1084,HER CRADLE.,of such a ship that its captain was a coward and the company that built
1085,HER CRADLE.,it were fools.
1086,HER CRADLE.,
1087,HER CRADLE.,And yet these souls of ours were fashioned for bottomless soundings.
1088,HER CRADLE.,There is no created thing that draws as deep as the soul of man; our
1089,HER CRADLE.,"life lies straight across the ocean and not along shore, but we are"
1090,HER CRADLE.,afraid to venture; we hang upon the coast and explore shallow lagoons or
1091,HER CRADLE.,swing at anchor in idle bays. Some of us strike the keel into riches and
1092,HER CRADLE.,"cruise about therein, like men-of-war in a narrow river. Some of us are"
1093,HER CRADLE.,contented all our days to ride at anchor in the becalmed waters of
1094,HER CRADLE.,"selfish ease. There are guns at every port-hole of the ship we sail, but"
1095,HER CRADLE.,"we use them for pegs to hang clothes upon, or pigeon-holes to stack full"
1096,HER CRADLE.,"of idle hours. We shall never smell powder, although the magazine is"
1097,HER CRADLE.,stocked with holy wrath wherewith to fight the devil and his deeds. When
1098,HER CRADLE.,"I see a man strolling along at his ease, while under his very nose some"
1099,HER CRADLE.,"brute is maltreating a horse, or some coward venting his ignoble wrath"
1100,HER CRADLE.,"upon a creature more helpless than he, whether it be a child or a dog, I"
1101,HER CRADLE.,involuntarily think of a double-decked whaler content to fish for
1102,HER CRADLE.,minnows. Their uselessness in the world is more apparent than the
1103,HER CRADLE.,uselessness of a Cunarder in a park pond.

1105,HER CRADLE.,"What did God give you muscle and girth and brain for, if not to launch"

1111,HER CRADLE.,Some great writer has said that we ought to begin life as at the source
1112,HER CRADLE.,"of a river, growing deeper every league to the sea, whereas, in fact,"
1113,HER CRADLE.,"thousands enter the river at its mouth, and sail inland, finding less"
1114,HER CRADLE.,"and less water every day, until in old age they lie shrunk and gasping"
1115,HER CRADLE.,upon dry ground.
1116,HER CRADLE.,
1117,HER CRADLE.,But there are more who do not sail at all than there are of those who
1118,HER CRADLE.,make the mistake of sailing up stream. There are the women who devote
1119,HER CRADLE.,their lives to the petty business of pleasing worthless men. What
1120,HER CRADLE.,progress do they make even inland? With sails set and brassy stanchions
1121,HER CRADLE.,"polished to the similitude of gold, they hover a lifetime chained to a"
1122,HER CRADLE.,"dock and decay of their own uselessness at last, like keels that are"
1123,HER CRADLE.,mud-slugged. It is not the most profitable thing in the world to please.
1124,HER CRADLE.,Suppose it shall please the inmates of a bedlam-house to see you set
1125,HER CRADLE.,"fire to your clothing and burn to death, or break your bones one by one"
1126,HER CRADLE.,"upon a rack, or otherwise destroy your bodily parts that the poor"
1127,HER CRADLE.,lunatics might be entertained. Would it pay to be pleasing to such an
1128,HER CRADLE.,audience at such a sacrifice? But the destruction of the loveliest body
1129,HER CRADLE.,in the world is nothing compared to the demoralization of soul that
1130,HER CRADLE.,takes place when women subvert everything lofty and noble within their
1131,HER CRADLE.,nature to win the transient regard of a few worthless men of the world.
1132,HER CRADLE.,They learn to smoke cigarettes because such men profess to like to see a
1133,HER CRADLE.,pretty woman affect the toughness of a rowdy. They drink in public
1134,HER CRADLE.,places and barter their honor all too often for handsome clothes in
1135,HER CRADLE.,"which to make a vain parade, all to please some heathen man, who in"
1136,HER CRADLE.,reality counts them a great way inferior to the value of a good horse.
1137,HER CRADLE.,"The right sort of a sweetheart, my dear, never desires to bring a woman"
1138,HER CRADLE.,down to his own level. He prefers to put her on a pedestal and say his
1139,HER CRADLE.,prayers to her. Never think that you are winning an admiration that
1140,HER CRADLE.,counts for much if you have to abate one whit of your womanhood to win
1141,HER CRADLE.,"it. Every time I see a woman drinking in a public resort, making herself"
1142,HER CRADLE.,"conspicuous by loud talk and louder laughter, I think of some fair ship"
1143,HER CRADLE.,"that should be making for the eternal city, with all its snow-white"
1144,HER CRADLE.,"canvas set, rotting at its docks, or cruising, arm's length from a"
1145,HER CRADLE.,barren land. We were put into this world with a clean way bill for
1146,HER CRADLE.,"another port than this. Across the ocean of life our way lies, straight"
1147,HER CRADLE.,to the harbor of the city of gold. We are freighted with a consignment
1148,HER CRADLE.,from quarter-deck to keel which is bound to be delivered sooner or later
1149,HER CRADLE.,"at the great master's wharf. Let us be alert, then, to recognize the"
1150,HER CRADLE.,seriousness of our own destinies and content ourselves no longer with
1151,HER CRADLE.,"shallow soundings. Spread the sails, weigh the anchor and point the prow"
1152,HER CRADLE.,for the country that lies the other side a deep and restless sea. Sooner
1153,HER CRADLE.,"or later the voyage must be made; let us make it, then, while the timber"
1154,HER CRADLE.,"is stanch and the rudder true. With a resolute will at the wheel, and"
1155,HER CRADLE.,"the great God himself to furnish the chart, our ship shall weather the"

1180,HER CRADLE.,"sweet young girl yet, one who was rightly trained and modestly brought"
1181,HER CRADLE.,"up, who took to decollete dresses naturally? Is not the first wearing of"

1183,HER CRADLE.,peach that a young woman is willing to show her pretty shoulders and
1184,HER CRADLE.,neck to the crowd; and who cares much for a rubbed plum or a brushed
1185,HER CRADLE.,"peach? I cannot imagine a sweet, wholesome-hearted woman, be she young"
1186,HER CRADLE.,"or old, divesting herself of half her clothes and thrusting herself upon"
1187,HER CRADLE.,the notice of ribald men. I can sooner imagine a rose tree bearing frog.
1188,HER CRADLE.,The conjunction is not possible. The cheek that will blush at the story
1189,HER CRADLE.,"of repentant shame, that will flame with indignant protest when the"
1190,HER CRADLE.,"skirts of a Magdalene brush too near, yet deepens not its rose at"
1191,HER CRADLE.,thought of uncovering neck and bust in a crowded theater or public
1192,HER CRADLE.,reception is not the cheek of modest and natural womanhood. It is not
1193,HER CRADLE.,"necessary to be a prude or a skinny old harridan either, to inveigh"
1194,HER CRADLE.,against the custom. I know full well how contemptible the affectations
1195,HER CRADLE.,and hypocrisies of life are. Half that is yielded to evil was meant for
1196,HER CRADLE.,good. The high chancellor of Hades has put his seal on much that was

1198,HER CRADLE.,so palpably shameless that to argue about them is like trying to prove

1347,THE VETERANS.,There was the girl who was made mad by means of the request that she
1348,THE VETERANS.,wash her hands before breakfast.
1349,THE VETERANS.,
1350,THE VETERANS.,There was the girl who entertained her callers in the drawing-room while
1351,THE VETERANS.,"the family was afar off, sojourning in the hills or by the waves of the"
1352,THE VETERANS.,sea;
1353,THE VETERANS.,
1354,THE VETERANS.,"Yea, who thought it no evil to bring forth the flesh-pot and the"
1355,THE VETERANS.,"brandied comfit, that the heart of the district policeman might leap"
1356,THE VETERANS.,"thereat, as the young buck leapeth at sight of the water courses."
1357,THE VETERANS.,
1358,THE VETERANS.,"There was also the girl who wasted, and the girl who stole; the girl who"
1359,THE VETERANS.,"never tried, and the girl who never cared."
1360,THE VETERANS.,
1361,THE VETERANS.,And seeing the multitude the spirit of the woman who dreamed arose
1362,THE VETERANS.,within her and she asked of a certain veiled one who seemed to be in
1363,THE VETERANS.,charge:
1364,THE VETERANS.,
1365,THE VETERANS.,"""Tell me, O shrouded one, is there never to be any diminution in the"
1366,THE VETERANS.,throng that cometh to take their abode in these halls of penitential
1367,THE VETERANS.,"regret?"""
1368,THE VETERANS.,
1369,THE VETERANS.,"And the spirit in charge made answer, saying:"
1370,THE VETERANS.,
1371,THE VETERANS.,"""No, nor never shall be while fools live and folly thrives."
1372,THE VETERANS.,
1373,THE VETERANS.,"""It is by reason of the babbling of busy-bodies that havoc has overtaken"
1374,THE VETERANS.,the land of thy forefathers.
1375,THE VETERANS.,
1376,THE VETERANS.,"""There is honor in faithful service, and an uncorruptible crown awaiteth"
1377,THE VETERANS.,the forehead of her who serveth well.
1378,THE VETERANS.,
1379,THE VETERANS.,"""It is no disgrace to the comely daughters of men who toil and are put"
1380,THE VETERANS.,to that they bring in the wherewithal to fill the mouths of the children
1381,THE VETERANS.,who call them father--
1382,THE VETERANS.,
1383,THE VETERANS.,"""It is no disgrace, I say unto you, if such maidens take unto themselves"
1384,THE VETERANS.,"the position of servants in the family of him who prospereth,"
1385,THE VETERANS.,
1386,THE VETERANS.,"""Remembering that one who lived long since and has slept these many"
1387,THE VETERANS.,"years in the tomb of his fathers, spake truly when he uttered these"
1388,THE VETERANS.,"words, albeit framed in rhyme:"
1389,THE VETERANS.,
1390,THE VETERANS.,"""Honor and shame from no condition rise;"
1391,THE VETERANS.,"Act well your part, there all the honor lies."""
1392,THE VETERANS.,
1393,THE VETERANS.,And it came to pass that the woman who dreamed took comfort to herself
1394,THE VETERANS.,by reason of her dream.
1395,THE VETERANS.,
1396,THE VETERANS.,And she arose from slumber like a strong man who desireth to run a race.
1397,THE VETERANS.,
1398,THE VETERANS.,"And buckling on more tightly the armor wherein she moved, yea, even with"
1399,THE VETERANS.,"a free hand buttoning the boot and drawing the string, she cogitated"
1400,THE VETERANS.,"unto herself, and these were the words of her cogitation:"
1401,THE VETERANS.,
1402,THE VETERANS.,"""Behold, I will learn a new wisdom that I may be unto my handmaids a"
1403,THE VETERANS.,"friend rather than a taskmistress, that in so doing I may win unto my"
1404,THE VETERANS.,household the damsel who hath intelligence. And my treatment of her
1405,THE VETERANS.,shall be such that many wise ones who call that damsel friend shall
1406,THE VETERANS.,decide to do even as she hath done and choose domestic service with a
1407,THE VETERANS.,woman who is kind even to the showing of interest in her handmaid's
1408,THE VETERANS.,"affairs, rather than linger in bondage with the shop girl and her who"
1409,THE VETERANS.,rattles the tinkling keys of the typewriter machine.
1410,THE VETERANS.,
1411,THE VETERANS.,"""So doing, my days shall increase mightily in the land, as also the days"
1412,THE VETERANS.,"of her who cometh after me."""

1416,THE VETERANS.,Women are either the noblest creation of God or the meanest. A good
1417,THE VETERANS.,woman is little less than an angel; a bad woman is considerably more
1418,THE VETERANS.,"than a devil. And by bad women I do not mean women who drink, or steal,"
1419,THE VETERANS.,or frequent brothels. The chief weapon of a bad woman is her tongue.
1420,THE VETERANS.,With a lie she can do more deadly work than the fellow in the bible did
1421,THE VETERANS.,with the jawbone of an ass. Untruth is the fundamental strata of all
1422,THE VETERANS.,"evil in a bad woman's nature, and with it she is more to be dreaded than"
1423,THE VETERANS.,many men with revolvers. There is absolutely no protection from a lie.
1424,THE VETERANS.,"The courts cannot protect from its venom, and to kill a defamer and a"
1425,THE VETERANS.,falsifier is not yet adjudged as legalized slaughter.

1429,THE VETERANS.,There is one awfully homely woman in Chicago. I met her the other day
1430,THE VETERANS.,over in Blank's art gallery. Our acquaintance was brief but sensational.
1431,THE VETERANS.,"I looked at her, tucked her into my handbag and wept. She didn't seem to"
1432,THE VETERANS.,"mind it, and when, a few hours later, in the seclusion of my chamber, I"
1433,THE VETERANS.,"took her out of the bag and looked at her again, she was more hideous"
1434,THE VETERANS.,than before.
1435,THE VETERANS.,
1436,THE VETERANS.,"""You horrible creature!"" said I. ""If you look like me, better that the"
1437,THE VETERANS.,"uttermost depths of the sea had me."""
1438,THE VETERANS.,
1439,THE VETERANS.,"""But I do look like you,"" said she, and her voice was weak and low by"
1440,THE VETERANS.,"reason of prolonged exposure to the sun and air, ""and Mr. Blank says I"
1441,THE VETERANS.,"will finish up very nicely."""
1442,THE VETERANS.,
1443,THE VETERANS.,"""Do you mean to tell me,"" I asked, ""that my nose is as big as yours?"""
1444,THE VETERANS.,
1445,THE VETERANS.,"""Of course it is,"" said she; ""pictures cannot lie. But comfort yourself"
1446,THE VETERANS.,with the assurance that a large nose is always an indication of
1447,THE VETERANS.,"intelligence."""
1448,THE VETERANS.,
1449,THE VETERANS.,"""Intelligence be blessed!"" said I, for I was getting excited;"
1450,THE VETERANS.,"""intelligence without beauty is like bread without butter, or a peacock"
1451,THE VETERANS.,"without a tail! If I possess such a nose as yours, madam, I shall take"
1452,THE VETERANS.,"to tract-distributing, galoshes and a cotton umbrella, and forget that I"
1453,THE VETERANS.,"was ever human."""
1454,THE VETERANS.,
1455,THE VETERANS.,"""You talk wildly, as all the rest of them do,"" said my thin companion."
1456,THE VETERANS.,"""Listen, for my time on earth is short, I am rapidly fading away, and"
1457,THE VETERANS.,what I say must be said briefly. If you look about you you will see that
1458,THE VETERANS.,"there exists, more or less hidden in every breast, the belief of one's"
1459,THE VETERANS.,"own beauty. The mirror, although a faithful friend, can never quite"
1460,THE VETERANS.,"disabuse the mind of that belief, and when the honest camera holds up"
1461,THE VETERANS.,"the actual presentation of one's self as an incontrovertible fact, the"
1462,THE VETERANS.,"disappointment is keen and hard to bear."""
1463,THE VETERANS.,
1464,THE VETERANS.,"""All that may be true,"" said I, ""but not all your assertions can ever"
1465,THE VETERANS.,"make me believe that that dusky mass of hair, brushed back so wildly"
1466,THE VETERANS.,"from those beetling brows, is like my own. You know that mine is soft"
1467,THE VETERANS.,"and brown, and yours looks like the bristles of an enraged stove brush."""
1468,THE VETERANS.,
1469,THE VETERANS.,"""That's the way they all talk,"" responded the dissolving view, ""but you"
1470,THE VETERANS.,do not stop to consider that under the artist's pencil the shadows will
1471,THE VETERANS.,"all be toned and softened. And let me say right here, that that"
1472,THE VETERANS.,"'beetling brow' is a sign of rare intelligence, much more to be desired"
1473,THE VETERANS.,"than the lower and more----"""
1474,THE VETERANS.,
1475,THE VETERANS.,"""Stop, right there!"" I interrupted. ""It is not necessary to have a brow"
1476,THE VETERANS.,"like a plate-glass show-window, or like an overhanging cliff, or like a"
1477,THE VETERANS.,"granite paving-stone, to denote intelligence! No, my friend, do not try"
1478,THE VETERANS.,to lift this shadow from my soul. That mouth that looks like a dark
1479,THE VETERANS.,"biscuit, that nose that looks like a promontory overhanging an unseen"
1480,THE VETERANS.,"sea, that hair that looks like the ruff of an excited chicken, that brow"
1481,THE VETERANS.,"that looks like a skating-rink, all make me sad. I shall never have my"
1482,THE VETERANS.,picture taken again. If I look like that it is time I died. In the round
1483,THE VETERANS.,"of an eventful life I may forget that I even saw you, but until I do I"
1484,THE VETERANS.,"am a tired woman. My mirror may assuage my sorrow, for that either lies"
1485,THE VETERANS.,"or catches me from a different point of view. Vanish then, oh, yellow"
1486,THE VETERANS.,"shade of an unhappy reality. Back to oblivion with you, and heaven grant"
1487,THE VETERANS.,"I never look upon your like again!"" So saying, I calmly held the poor"
1488,THE VETERANS.,but hideous creature in the flame of a gas-jet and smilingly cremated
1489,THE VETERANS.,her.

1493,THE VETERANS.,A fairer day than last Sunday was never cradled to rest behind the
1494,THE VETERANS.,"curtains of night. It began with a flute obligato of sunrise, orbed"
1495,THE VETERANS.,itself into a full orchestra wherein color took the part of first and
1496,THE VETERANS.,"second violins, and declined at last into the hush of sunset like the"
1497,THE VETERANS.,mellow notes of a cello under old Paul Schessling's master touch. Such
1498,THE VETERANS.,days visit the earth rarely. They are advance sheets of a story that is
1499,THE VETERANS.,going to be told in heaven; preludes to a song that we shall hear in its
1500,THE VETERANS.,perfection only when we have got through with the clattering discords of
1501,THE VETERANS.,time. Thank God for all such days. They do us more good than we know.
1502,THE VETERANS.,"The sight of the woods, adorned as only queens are adorned for the court"
1503,THE VETERANS.,"of the king, the sound of falling leaves and lonely bird songs, of"
1504,THE VETERANS.,"hidden lutes, of unseen brooks, tremulous and sweet and low under the"
1505,THE VETERANS.,"russet shadows, uplift our souls and help us to forget, for the time"
1506,THE VETERANS.,"being at least, how tired we are, how worn with the fret of sordid toil"
1507,THE VETERANS.,and how tormented and misjudged and calumniated we are by those who fain
1508,THE VETERANS.,would do us harm. I think if I had time to do some of the things I want
1509,THE VETERANS.,to do the first consummation of that happy time would be to build me a
1510,THE VETERANS.,"little cabin in the woods, where, in utter loneliness, I could forget"
1511,THE VETERANS.,how full the world is growing to be of folks and how prone they are to
1512,THE VETERANS.,do each other harm and hinder rather than help each other on the stony
1513,THE VETERANS.,way to heaven.

1517,THE VETERANS.,"The other evening, while sitting in the gallery of the Auditorium and"
1518,THE VETERANS.,looking over the balcony edge at the crowd waiting for the curtain to
1519,THE VETERANS.,"rise, a strange thought came to my mind. How could hell be more quickly"
1520,THE VETERANS.,created than by the unmasking of such a crowd as this? Suddenly remove
1521,THE VETERANS.,from humanity all power of self-control and conventional dissimulation;
1522,THE VETERANS.,"force men and women to be natural, and act out every evil impulse latent"
1523,THE VETERANS.,"in their souls, and could Dante himself portray a blacker Inferno? The"
1524,THE VETERANS.,man whose heart is full of murderous hatred--tear off the mask that
1525,THE VETERANS.,"hides his perturbed soul, and what a demon would look forth! The woman"
1526,THE VETERANS.,behind whose amiable seeming lurks malicious envy and snarling temper
1527,THE VETERANS.,and crafty deceit--what a pandemonium would ensue when such passion
1528,THE VETERANS.,broke forth like straining dogs from the leash! The old man with the
1529,THE VETERANS.,saintly face and the crown of hoary hair--could an open cage of foul
1530,THE VETERANS.,birds send forth a blacker brood than should fly out from his soul when
1531,THE VETERANS.,some omnipotent hand unlatched the bars of its prison and let the
1532,THE VETERANS.,unclean thoughts go free? The young man with the perfumed breath and the
1533,THE VETERANS.,suave and courtly manner--does any storied hell hold captive blacker
1534,THE VETERANS.,"demons than the cruel selfishness, the impurities and the secret vices"
1535,THE VETERANS.,that walk to and fro in his soul like tigers behind their bars? The
1536,THE VETERANS.,young girl with face like a rose and the form of a Juno--could anything
1537,THE VETERANS.,that hades holds strike greater dismay to the hearts of men than the
1538,THE VETERANS.,"unmasking of her hidden thoughts? Ah, when the hour strikes for"
1539,THE VETERANS.,"unmasking time in life's parade ball, when death steps forth and with"
1540,THE VETERANS.,"cool, relentless touch unties the knot that holds the silken thing in"
1541,THE VETERANS.,"place that has hidden our true selves from our beautiful seeming, we"
1542,THE VETERANS.,shall find no more fiery hell awaiting us than that we have carried so
1543,THE VETERANS.,long in our hearts.
1544,THE VETERANS.,
1545,THE VETERANS.,I would not like to be regarded as a pessimist from the writing of such
1546,THE VETERANS.,a paragraph as the above. Sometimes I seek to turn my thoughts upon the
1547,THE VETERANS.,crowd and unmask the angel as well as the demon. But I find that the
1548,THE VETERANS.,"angels, as a general thing, wear no face concealers. They go disguised"
1549,THE VETERANS.,"in poor clothes and scant bravery of attire, but the angel within them"
1550,THE VETERANS.,is like a singing bird rather than like a silent and chained beast. It
1551,THE VETERANS.,"reveals itself in songs, like a caged lark. It looks from out the window"
1552,THE VETERANS.,of the eyes in loving glances and tender smiles; it manifests itself in
1553,THE VETERANS.,"sweet and cheerful service, like the sunshine that can neither be hidden"
1554,THE VETERANS.,nor concealed.

1559,THE VETERANS.,"query which is the best, a little child, a fruit orchard in early June,"
1560,THE VETERANS.,or a young girl. I think the latter carries the day. Did you ever watch
1561,THE VETERANS.,a flock of birds sitting for a moment on the mossy gable of a sloping
1562,THE VETERANS.,roof? How they flutter and fuss and chirp; how they preen their delicate
1563,THE VETERANS.,"feathers and get all mixed up with the sunshine and the shadow, until"
1564,THE VETERANS.,which is bird and which is sunbeam one can scarcely tell. There is a
1565,THE VETERANS.,"flock of girls with whom I ride every morning, and they make me think of"
1566,THE VETERANS.,birds and sunbeams. They are so bewitching with their changeful moods
1567,THE VETERANS.,and graces that I sit and watch them as one listens to the twitter of
1568,THE VETERANS.,"swallows. They sweeten up life, these girls, as sugar sweetens dough;"
1569,THE VETERANS.,they fill it with music as sleigh bells fill a winter night. God bless
1570,THE VETERANS.,"the girls, the bonnie, sweet and winsome girls, and may womanhood be for"

1642,THE VETERANS.,There is something that is getting to be awfully scarce in this world.
1643,THE VETERANS.,Shall I tell you what it is? It is girls. That is what is missing out of
1644,THE VETERANS.,"the sentient, breathing, living world just now. We have lots of young"
1645,THE VETERANS.,"ladies and lots of society misses, but the sweet, old-fashioned girls of"
1646,THE VETERANS.,ever so long ago are vanished with the poke bonnets and the cinnamon
1647,THE VETERANS.,cookies. Let me enumerate a few of the kinds of girls that are wanted.
1648,THE VETERANS.,In the first place we want home girls--girls who are mothers' right
1649,THE VETERANS.,"hand; girls who can cuddle the little ones next best to mamma, and"
1650,THE VETERANS.,smooth out the tangles in the domestic skein when things get twisted;
1651,THE VETERANS.,"girls whom father takes comfort in for something better than beauty, and"
1652,THE VETERANS.,the big brothers are proud of for something that outranks the ability to
1653,THE VETERANS.,"dance or shine in society. Next, we want girls of sense--girls who have"
1654,THE VETERANS.,"a standard of their own regardless of conventionalities, and are"
1655,THE VETERANS.,independent enough to live up to it; girls who simply won't wear a
1656,THE VETERANS.,trailing dress on the street to gather up microbes and all sorts of
1657,THE VETERANS.,"defilement; girls who won't wear a high hat to the theater, or lacerate"
1658,THE VETERANS.,their feet and endanger their health with high heels and corsets; girls
1659,THE VETERANS.,who will wear what is pretty and becoming and snap their fingers at the
1660,THE VETERANS.,dictates of fashion when fashion is horrid and silly. And we want good
1661,THE VETERANS.,"girls--girls who are sweet, right straight out from the heart to the"
1662,THE VETERANS.,lips; innocent and pure and simple girls with less knowledge of sin and
1663,THE VETERANS.,duplicity and evil-doing at twenty than the pert little school girl at
1664,THE VETERANS.,ten has all too often; girls who say their prayers and read their Bibles
1665,THE VETERANS.,"and love God and keep his commandments. (We want these girls ""awful"

1673,THE VETERANS.,"who are full of tenderness and sympathy, with tears that flow for other"
1674,THE VETERANS.,"people's ills, and smiles that light outward their own beautiful"
1675,THE VETERANS.,"thoughts. We have lots of clever girls, and brilliant girls, and witty"
1676,THE VETERANS.,"girls. Give us a consignment of jolly girls, warm-hearted and impulsive"
1677,THE VETERANS.,"girls; kind and entertaining to their own folks, and with little desire"
1678,THE VETERANS.,to shine in the garish world. With a few such girls scattered around
1679,THE VETERANS.,"life would freshen up for all of us, as the weather does under the spell"

1691,THE VETERANS.,flower that lies just now upon my window-sill. There is the purple of
1692,THE VETERANS.,Queen Sheba mantled in its soft and shiny texture; the gold of Ophir was
1693,THE VETERANS.,not more sumptuous; the light that breaks at dawn across a reef of
1694,THE VETERANS.,dove-gray clouds was never more delicate than the violet heart of this
1695,THE VETERANS.,"lovely blossom. When I want to think of the ideal court of kings, of a"

1729,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,It was not so very long ago that I chanced to overhear a lively young
1730,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,woman make this remark about her mother:
1731,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1732,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"""Oh, mamma is nearly always taken for my sister. She never seems like"
1733,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"anything more than one of my girl friends."""
1734,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1735,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Poor child, thought I, your state is only another phase of orphanhood,"
1736,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,for the young life that has no counsel of motherhood is bereft indeed.
1737,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1738,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"No girlish comradeship, however juvenile and delightful it may be, can"
1739,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"possibly take the place of protecting, counseling, mother-love. Not but"
1740,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,what the sweetest relationship possible exists where the mother keeps
1741,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"her heart young and in sympathy with her daughter, but there is"
1742,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,something else requisite to mother-love.
1743,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1744,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,The best mothers are those who have roomy laps where the big girls love
1745,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,to sit while they whisper the confidences they never could reveal to
1746,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sister-mothers. They have all-enfolding arms, these right kind of"
1747,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"mothers, wherein they gather the tired girl, yes, and the tired boys,"
1748,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"too, and rock them to rest and peace, long after their ""feet touch the"
1749,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"floor."""
1750,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1751,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,They used to tell me I must never sit on anybody's lap after my feet
1752,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"reached the carpet, but, thank God, that rule never applied to my"
1753,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,mother.
1754,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1755,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"You are never afraid of disturbing mother's ""beauty sleep"" when you come"
1756,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"in late at night if she is of the good reliable sort, as far removed"
1757,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,from frisky girl companionship as the moon is from its reflection.
1758,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1759,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,No matter how tardy your home-faring may be she is always up with a
1760,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,lunch and a warm fire in winter or a glass of something cool and fresh
1761,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"in summer to soothe your overexcited nerves, a thing she cannot do if"
1762,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,she is forever dancing about with you in your youthful larks. She has a
1763,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"way of calming your tempers with a joke and a caress, of which the"
1764,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sister-mother never dreams. She has also a way of smoothing your hair,"
1765,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"which your girl comrade never caught the trick of, for the reason that"
1766,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"she is kept too busy curling her own love-locks. When your head aches,"
1767,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,the right sort of mother knows just how to pet you to sleep and leave
1768,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,you in a darkened room with a rose on your pillow to greet your waking
1769,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,eyes; if you have a bad cold she knows the cuddly way to coax you to
1770,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,take bitter medicine. She bathes your feet and dries them on nice warm
1771,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"towels. She keeps the younger children from guying you, because your"
1772,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"nose is red; in short, she does a thousand nice things of which the"
1773,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,sister-mother has no knack whatever.
1774,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1775,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"When great trouble falls to your share, when sharp betrayal pierces your"
1776,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"heart, and trusted affection turns to ashes in your hold of what good is"
1777,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,the juvenile mother with her girlish tremors and tears? You want
1778,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"somebody next in tenderness to God, to hold you fast and tight. You want"
1779,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"somebody who has suffered and grown strong, to soothe your breaking"
1780,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,heart. Somebody who can be silent and brave and steady until your fever
1781,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,is passed. The shipwrecked sailor wants a rope rather than a feint of
1782,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"throwing one; the shipwrecked soul wants a heart like rock, rather than"
1783,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,a handclasp and a promise. The sister-mother may be all right to go to
1784,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"parties with, but you want something stronger and more steadfast to lean"
1785,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,upon in time of perplexity. You want a mother in all the holy
1786,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"significance of the name. However sweet the tie of sisterhood, it cannot"
1787,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"be so blessed as the bond of patient, long-suffering, sanctified"
1788,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,motherhood.
1789,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1790,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Seek to keep yourself in sympathy with your girls, then, mothers, but be"
1791,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,content to occupy a generation removed from the path they tread. Don't
1792,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,make up in emulation of their beauty; don't seek to win away their beaus
1793,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,and outdress them. Don't go decollete to parties where your girls should
1794,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,be the reigning belles; don't aim to vie with them in fascination or in
1795,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"charm. Be guider and ready counselor, but don't try to be rival. If God"
1796,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"has given you a girl child, and that child has grown to womanhood,"
1797,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,accept the condition of things and give over being a society belle
1798,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"yourself, abdicating your place for the infinitely sweeter one of"
1799,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,mother. You cannot be the right sort of mother and ignore your duty to
1800,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,your child. That duty lies in giving her her rightful place in the line
1801,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,of march from which you are crowded out. Let her carry the banner while
1802,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"you fall back a little. Watch over her, make things easy for her, smooth"
1803,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the little difficulties out of her way, be on hand when she comes home"
1804,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,tired and excited to soothe her to rest and calm; counsel her how to
1805,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"pick her way through the snares that are laid for youth and beauty, be a"
1806,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"refuge where she can run when the rainy weather sets in, which is sure"
1807,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"to fall in the summer time of youth, somewhere and somehow. In short, be"
1808,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"just as sympathetic and chummy and sociable as possible, but at the same"
1809,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,time make your daughter feel that you are older and stronger and wiser
1810,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"than she, by reason of your motherhood, and that next to God you stand"
1811,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"ready to shield her, to guide her, to receive her in time of trouble, to"
1812,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"forgive her if she needs forgiveness, and to shrive her if she needs"
1813,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"confessing. Teach her that your love can never fail, that your heart is"
1814,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,a rock and a fortress and a shield for her to seek in all life's
1815,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"bewilderment, far surer and more steadfast than any other love beneath"
1816,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,the stars can ever yield.
1817,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1818,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,When I think of all it means to be a mother I tremble to think how far
1819,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,short of the standard the best of us fall. I would rather have it said
1820,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"of me when I die, ""She was a good mother,"" than that men should get"
1821,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"together and exploit my deeds as poet, reformer, artist or story-teller."
1822,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,I would rather feel the dewfall of a child's loving tear upon my face
1823,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,than wear a laureate's crown.
1824,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1825,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Don't be critical, or censorious, or reserved with your daughters; don't"
1826,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,hold them far off and cultivate respect and fear rather than love; don't
1827,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,be self-assertive and cause them to feel their dependence upon you in an
1828,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,unpleasant way; don't be too eager to keep them in the background in
1829,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"little things relating to the home, such as giving them no voice in the"
1830,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"arrangement of the room and the domestic regulations. Indeed, I have"
1831,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,known more attrition caused in the home circle from this last mentioned
1832,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,point of difference between mother and daughters than almost any other.
1833,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"I know a family, presided over by a good, unselfish woman, who, as a"
1834,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"mother, is the most complete failure I ever ran across. Her daughter is"
1835,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"of mature age and pronounced opinions, but she is kept in the background"
1836,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,and her life rendered most unhappy by the dominant will of the mother
1837,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,whose old-fashioned views as to running the house are directly opposed
1838,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,to more modern customs. The two wrangle continually over the
1839,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"establishment of a dinner hour, the disposal of a light, the drapery of"
1840,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"a window, the adjustment of furniture, until there is less harmony under"
1841,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,the roof than there is music in a hurdy-gurdy. How much better it would
1842,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,be if that mother would yield a little to the wishes of her daughter;
1843,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,give the latter a chance to display her own taste and carry out her
1844,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,inclination. I don't believe in the mothers and fathers of grown-up
1845,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,daughters always insisting upon the occupancy of the front seats and the
1846,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,leadership of the orchestra.

1859,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"woods and dales it is borne in upon me to hold a little ""love feast"""
1860,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"with the boys. You know what a love feast is, if there was ever a"
1861,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Methodist in your family. It is a good, cozy talk among the brethren and"
1862,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sisters in regard to the best way of putting down the devil, and giving"
1863,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,the good angels a chance. And if there was ever need of downing the
1864,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,devil it is in the particular instance of a boy's inhumanity to birds
1865,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"and beasts. I have expressed myself as to horses, and to-day I shall"
1866,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"talk about birds. On these spring mornings, when the world is enveloped"
1867,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"in a golden halo, from out of which, like angel voices from the quiet"
1868,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"depths of heaven, the birds are singing their impromptu of praise,"
1869,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,imagine a lot of half-grown men and brutal boys going forth with guns
1870,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,and sling-shots to break up the concert and murder the choristers. I
1871,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,would as soon turn a lot of sharp-shooters into a cathedral at early
1872,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,mass to bring down the surpliced boys and the chanting novices. I tell
1873,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"you, O race of good-for-nothing fathers and mothers, whom God holds"
1874,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,directly responsible for the bad boys who desecrate this beautiful
1875,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"world, you are no more fit for the training of immortal souls than a"
1876,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,hawk is fitted to teach music to a thrush. You ought to have had a
1877,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,bear-skin and been the trainer of cubs. That your boys develop into
1878,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"brutes and go to state's prison, and perhaps die at the end of a rope"
1879,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"eventually, is nobody's fault but your own. If you chance to own a horse"
1880,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"or a dog you show some care in its training, but God gives you a boy and"
1881,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,you let him run wild. There is no more reason why a boy should be cruel
1882,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,than that a properly-broken colt should kick. The tendency may have been
1883,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"born with him, but good training eliminates it to a great extent, if not"
1884,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"entirely. When I was a woman and lived at home, in the happy days before"
1885,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"I entered the arena to fight for bread and butter, to say nothing of"
1886,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"shoe leather and fuel, I used to gather the village boys about me every"
1887,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"spring and try to sow the good seeds of tenderness with one hand, while"
1888,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,carefully eliminating the tares with the other. I offered prizes for
1889,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the best record at the end of the summer. I formed classes, the"
1890,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"membership of which pledged themselves, to a boy, to abstain from"
1891,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sling-shots, to cultivate the birds' nests and to withhold their hands"
1892,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,from the commission of a single deed of cruelty. Many is the gallon of
1893,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,ice-cream I have paid for to keep those youngsters in the narrow path of
1894,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"rectitude, and many is the time that I have patrolled the woods with my"
1895,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"boy comrades, keeping watch over the family of a blue-bird or a robin,"
1896,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,when the alarm went forth that some unregenerate boy was on the rampage.
1897,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"All the boys whom I could get to join the club I was sure of, for I know"
1898,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the way to a boy's heart, if I can only get the chance at him. For what"
1899,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,other purpose did nature turn me out a born cook? And why did she make
1900,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,me a master hand at doughnuts and turnover pies? I have a large and
1901,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"undying faith in the boys, if you will only start them right. The first"
1902,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,thing a boy needs is a good mother. He can get along without a
1903,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,father--and I was going to say without a God--for the first few years of
1904,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"his life, but he needs a mother. Not a mere nurse maid to look after"
1905,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"his clothes and see that he has plenty to eat at the right intervals,"
1906,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"but a good, sweet, companionable mother, with a good, soft breast for"
1907,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,him to cry on and two arms to hug him with. He needs a mother who can
1908,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"talk with him and answer his questions, who is not stern and severe, but"
1909,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,responsive and get-at-able. With such a mother our boys will be gentle
1910,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,and our birds will be safe.
1911,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1912,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Try to think, boys, what a world this would be without any robins, or"
1913,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"larks, or thrushes; without any songs in the apple trees getting all"
1914,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,tangled up with the sunshine and the blossoms; without any canaries to
1915,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sing in the window, or any meadow larks to whip out their flutes among"
1916,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,the clover heads. If you should wake up some morning and experience the
1917,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,ghastly silence of a songless world you would want to hire somebody to
1918,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,thrash you that you ever used a sling-shot. Do you remember the minister
1919,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,down New York way whom they fined for shooting robins? I never wanted to
1920,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,get up on a mountain top so much in all my life and shout glory as I did
1921,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"over that verdict. I have heard of immorality among ministers, and I"
1922,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,have heard of hypocrisy and lying and all sorts of offenses against
1923,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"good taste and morals, but I never heard of anything so contemptibly and"
1924,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,causelessly mean as for one of God's especial teachers to get up in the
1925,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"morning, put on top boots, cross the river in the sunshine and dew of"
1926,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"early morning, lift his gun, take deliberate aim and bring down a robin."
1927,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,If I was the Lord I would never forgive it. Men are not to blame
1928,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sometimes when their blood gets too warm and they do impetuous things,"
1929,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,but to deliberately descend to the ignominy of shooting a robin and
1930,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,calling it sport is to sink too low for justification.
1931,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
1932,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Whatever else you be, boys, be brave. If you must sail in and fight, if"
1933,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"your superfluous zeal is too much for you, go out in the field and"
1934,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,square off at a bull. There is some glory in whipping anything bigger
1935,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"and stronger than yourself, but to show fight to a bird is a little too"
1936,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,much like sneaking out and tripping up a cripple in the dark. I am going

1963,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,great clouds rush into the sky and obscure the sun? Why are girls so
1964,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"proud to parade an engagement ring upon their finger, when the diamond"
1965,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,is too often the danger-light thrown out above the breakers? Now and
1966,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"then, about as rarely as one picks up a ruby on the highway, or finds an"
1967,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"enchanted swan circling over the duck pond, there is a happy"
1968,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,marriage--at least such is the popular inference--as to the absolute
1969,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"certainty of the statement, ask the skeleton closet. I have lived a"
1970,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,varied sort of life. I have wandered to and fro over the earth to some
1971,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"extent; I have known a great many people, and have found happiness in"
1972,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"many ways, but looking back over all the path to-night and turning my"
1973,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"little bull's-eye lantern of experience up to the present moment, I can"
1974,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,neither remember nor record a dozen truly happy marriages. What
1975,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,constitutes happiness? Peace. What brings peace? Content. Who is
1976,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,contented? Not you and not I. What man or woman of all whom we know can
1977,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"we bring out into the full light of day and say of them, ""Behold the"
1978,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"contented one! The restful one! The happy pair!"" You, my dear, have"
1979,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,attained the ambition of your youthful dreams. You have married a man
1980,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"who dresses you splendidly, who gives you diamonds and never murmurs"
1981,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,when the bills come in. But are you happy? Do you never walk to and fro
1982,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"with the restless countess in the sad old ballad, dreaming of ""Alan"
1983,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Percy?"" Do you never, when all is still, go down into that cemetery"
1984,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"where life's ""might have beens"" lie buried in graves kept green forever"
1985,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"with your tears, and walk and dream alone? And you, my friend, have"
1986,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,married the man of your choice. Is there nothing in the handsome
1987,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,exterior that palls a bit now and then when you find how sordid and
1988,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,meager the soul is behind the smile you used to think so charming? Do
1989,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,you never find scorn creeping into your heart in place of adoration when
1990,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,you mark the unpaid bills and the shiftless endeavor that strew his idle
1991,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"way? And you, sir, have a merry and a pretty wife and the world calls"
1992,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,you a lucky fellow. How many know of the sharp tongue that underlies her
1993,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,laughter and the feather-filled head that never yet has donated an
1994,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"earnest thought to the domestic economy? And you, my good sir, have"
1995,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,married a blue stocking in the old acceptance of the term. She can
1996,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"swing off a leader or make a speech on a rostrum at short notice, but"
1997,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"how would you like to rise right up here, poor dear, and tell just what"
1998,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,comfort lies in being mated to a superior being who busies herself with
1999,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,work which shall be remembered perhaps when the dust on the center
2000,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"table, the holes in your stockings, the discomfort of the larder, and"
2001,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the untidiness of the household are forgotten? And you, my good fellow,"
2002,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"have married a woman of ""good form."" She never does an indiscreet thing."
2003,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"She is ""icily faultless"" and splendidly stupid. She has the neck of a"
2004,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"swan, the arms of a goddess, the foot of a patrician, and the soul of a"
2005,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"mouse! The scent of a wayside lilac, perhaps, is sadder than tears to"
2006,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"you, old comrade, when you look back across the years and see again the"
2007,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"sweet dead face of one you trifled with, or whom you deserted for this"

2013,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,There is entire hopelessness to many women in the blank monotony of life
2014,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"after youth is past. An emotional nature, mercurial and restless, full"
2015,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"of aspirations and longings, as the trees this perfect month are full of"
2016,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"blossoms, and, like the trees, bearing a thousand blooms to one"
2017,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"fruition, finds the destiny prepared for it almost unendurable, and"
2018,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,often longs for death that shall end all. Because poverty grinds and
2019,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"hosts of menial duties accumulate, because the walls of an unquiet home,"
2020,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"made unlovely perhaps by skeletons that no skill can quite conceal,"
2021,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"close like a dungeon upon hope and all the sweet promises of youth,"
2022,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"bright natures grow morose and bitter, warm hearts chill into apathy and"
2023,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"gloom, and sunny brows darken under the cloud of almost perpetual"
2024,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,irritability and discontent. It is useless to preach sermons to such
2025,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,cases--as useless as to read a book of etiquette in a prison ward or
2026,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,comfort the victims of a railroad disaster with a treatise upon reform
2027,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"in the management of roads. The worn, the wasted, the erring, and the"
2028,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"cruelly maimed lie thick about us. Our business is to encourage, to"
2029,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"love, to bind up, and cheer. God, in His own time, shall lift the"
2030,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,discontented head above the power of conspiring cares to vex. It is for
2031,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"us to lend a helping hand down here where the ""slough of despond"" is"
2032,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"deepest. When tides forget to obey the moon, or leaves to answer the"
2033,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"will of the wind, then, and not sooner, shall these restless hearts of"
2034,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"ours learn to be still, whatsoever destinies confront, or limitations"
2035,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"thwart. In looking upon the lives of some women, the mother of six"
2036,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"children, for instance, who takes boarders and keeps no help; the widow"
2037,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,supporting her little brood by endless drudgeries; the big-hearted woman
2038,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,in whom the frolicsomeness and wit of girlhood die hard amid the sordid
2039,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"miseries of a poverty-stricken life; the sensitive, poetic soul, doomed"
2040,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,to uncongenial companionships and the criticisms and ridicule of the
2041,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"unfriendly--I am reminded of the score of eagles I saw lately, chained"
2042,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"in a dusty inclosure of Central Park. With clipped wings, and grand,"
2043,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"homesick eyes, they sat disconsolate upon their perches, and moped the"
2044,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,hours away. Would any sane being have reviled those sorry beings for a
2045,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,lack of spirit? Would not the gentle-hearted spectator have proffered a
2046,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"handful of fresh leaves rather, and turned away in pity that sympathy"
2047,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,could do no more?
2048,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,
2049,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"For these unhappy sisters of mine, the discontented, yearning"
2050,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"""Marthas,"" troubled with many cares, wherever my letter may find them"
2051,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"between the great seas, I have a word of comfort in my heart to-day. In"
2052,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the first place, do not think, because you so often fall into"
2053,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"irritability and impatient speech, that God despises you as a sinner. He"
2054,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"understands, if friend, husband, or neighbor do not. Strive not to yield"
2055,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"to fretfulness then, but, when overcome by it, remember always God"
2056,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,understands it all. You may be able to see no light in all the shrouded
2057,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"way, no lifting of the shadow, no promise of the dawn; but rest assured,"
2058,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"however long the probation, the infinite content of Heaven awaits us"
2059,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"very soon, if we strive as much as lies within us to overcome the"
2060,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"infirmities of our temper, and keep our faces set towards the shining of"
2061,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"His love. I know, dear heart, indeed I do, that to-morrow and to-morrow"
2062,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"are just alike to hopeless fancy--full of dish-washing, and drudging,"
2063,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,and back-bending toil--that the sparkle and song of life were long ago
2064,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,merged in the humdrum beat of treadmill years; but through just this
2065,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,test is your character building--through just its hard process is
2066,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,shaping the conqueror's crown flashing with splendid light. As the root
2067,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"tarries in the dark mold to burst by-and-by into radiant bloom above it,"
2068,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,so your poor life is hidden now to bloom to-morrow. You are not wicked
2069,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"because you sometimes murmur, but try and think so much of what is going"
2070,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,to be that you shall forget what is. The Tender Heart above absolves
2071,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"your beaten spirit from willful sin, though you are sometimes swept away"
2072,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,on currents of doubt and unfaith; but try and keep your eye fixed upon
2073,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the headlight of His love, whatever currents drift you away. Remember"
2074,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"how human parents deal with their children, and learn a lesson of God's"
2075,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"dealings. If my little girl has the ear-ache, or any other tormenting"
2076,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"ailment of childhood, do I stand over her and exact songs and smiles?"
2077,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"And do you think that when God, for some good reason of his own, lays"
2078,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"heavy burdens upon a life, He is going to demand unswerving sweetness of"
2079,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,speech or ethereal mildness of temper? When I see one scrubbing who was
2080,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"fitted to adorn the drawing-room, washing dishes who was created an"
2081,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"artist or a genius, darning small boys' linsey pants and homespun"
2082,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,stockings who was intended by nature to reign the crowned priestess of
2083,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,some high vocation; when I mark the furrows and zigzag footprints that
2084,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,an army of besieging cares have left on the cheek that in girlhood
2085,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"outblushed the wayside rose, or note how the hands that once drew"
2086,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,divinest music from obedient keys have twisted and warped in the
2087,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"performance of homely duties, I feel impelled to kiss the faded cheek"
2088,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"with a love surpassing a lover's, to fold the poor hands in a reverent"
2089,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"grasp, for I tell you, however often she may faint and falter by the"
2090,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"way, however ""fretty,"" and worn, and peevish she may become, the woman"
2091,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"who perseveres in the performance of uncongenial duties, who struggles"
2092,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"through the flatness of monotonous drudgeries, conquering adverse"
2093,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"circumstances, poverty, and destiny, by patience, love, and Christian"
2094,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"faith, is a heroine fit to rank with martyrs and saints. Remember, I am"
2095,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,not talking to women who find the burdens hard to bear and do not bear
2096,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"them; to mere whimperers, who, because the road is full of stones, sit"
2097,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"down and refuse to travel; but to the brave, true hearts who ""press"
2098,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"onward"" although no rose blossoms and no bird sings, content to"
2099,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"faithfully perform the task of life, hoping that the fullness of time"
2100,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,shall read the riddle of incongruous destiny. I have seen the time when
2101,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,household work seemed newly cursed--the very dew of the primal
2102,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"malediction upon it; when to charge upon the dinner dishes, attack the"
2103,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"lamps, or descend into the vortex of family patching, seemed to call for"
2104,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,greater courage than average human nature possessed. And when I imagine
2105,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"that shrinking carried on through dry years of monotonous experience,"
2106,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the same formulas to be observed, the same distaste to be overcome"
2107,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"throughout a lifetime of toil, yet no duty shirked, no obligation set"
2108,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"aside, I wonder if Heaven holds a crown too bright for such faithful"
2109,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,lives.

2113,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,The time of the year for violets and also for tramps is drawing near.
2114,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,Did you ever stop and think just what it means to be a tramp? It means
2115,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"no work, no money, no home, no shelter, no friends. Nobody in all the"
2116,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,world to care whether you live or die like a dog by the roadside. It
2117,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"means no heaven for such rags to crawl into, no grave to hide them out"
2118,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,of sight and no hand stretched out in all the world to give the greeting
2119,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,and the good-by of love. It means nobody in all the world to feel any
2120,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"interest in you and no spot in all the world to call your own, not even"
2121,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"the mud wherein your vagrant footprint falls, no prospect ahead, and no"
2122,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"link unbroken to bind you to the past. I tell you, when we sit down and"
2123,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"figure out just what the term means, it will not be quite so easy next"
2124,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,time the wretched tramp calls at our door to set the dog upon him or
2125,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"turn him empty-handed away. Let them work, you say. Look here, my good"
2126,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"friend, do you know how absolutely impossible a thing it is getting to"
2127,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,be in this overcrowded country for even a willing man to find work? It
2128,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"used to be that ""every dog had his day,"" but the dogs far outnumber the"
2129,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"days in free America. I know well educated, competent men who have been"
2130,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"out of employment for months and years. I know brave and earnest women,"
2131,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"with little children to support, who have worn beaten paths from place"
2132,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"to place seeking, not charity, but honest employment, and failed to find"
2133,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,it. What chance is there for a ragged tramp when such as these fail?
2134,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"Remember, once in a while, if you can, that the most grizzled and"
2135,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,wretched tramp that ever plodded his way to a pauper's grave was once a
2136,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,child and cradled in arms perhaps as fond as those that enfolded you and
2137,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,me. Remember that your mother and his were made sisters by the pangs of
2138,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"maternal pain, and perhaps in the heaven from which the saintly eyes of"
2139,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,your mother are watching for you his mother is looking out for him.
2140,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,Perhaps--who knows?--the footfall of the ragged and despised tramp shall
2141,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,"gain upon yours and find the gate of deliverance first, in spite of your"
2142,MY ROSE AND MY CHILD.,money and your pride.

2158,THE BROOK.,Orbing itself in a crystal lake
2159,THE BROOK.,"Set round with thickets of tangled brake,"

2181,THE BROOK.,"Alone we are born, alone we live, alone we die, alone we pay the penalty"
2182,THE BROOK.,or reap the reward of our evil or well doing. In the troubles that
2183,THE BROOK.,"assail us we stand singly, however many councillors may flock to the"
2184,THE BROOK.,"door of our tent. Not one in all the world, the nearest, the dearest or"
2185,THE BROOK.,"the best, can bear one pang of life's experience for us, love us as they"
2186,THE BROOK.,"may. We often hear a mother say: ""My child is so headstrong; she will"
2187,THE BROOK.,"not take my advice; she will go her own way."" Of course she will, and"
2188,THE BROOK.,"she will not, simply because individual tact is the law of all"
2189,THE BROOK.,"experience. It is not being headstrong, it is merely fulfilling destiny."
2190,THE BROOK.,
2191,THE BROOK.,"In the fight we wage we do not fight by platoons or squads, under a"
2192,THE BROOK.,"common leader, a thousand at a charge. We enter the lists one by one and"
2193,THE BROOK.,fight single handed. We choose our own colors and there is little of
2194,THE BROOK.,pageantry or show. When we fall we fall as travelers disappear who walk
2195,THE BROOK.,"across a coast that is honeycombed with quicksand. We vanish, not in"
2196,THE BROOK.,crowds like men who are jostled out of life by earthquakes or flooded
2197,THE BROOK.,"like rats by tidal waves, but we slowly succumb to the inevitable in"
2198,THE BROOK.,"solitudes where only the stars watch us and the spaces of a dim,"
2199,THE BROOK.,unsounded sea catch the fret of our mortal moan.
2200,THE BROOK.,
2201,THE BROOK.,I have always thought that I should love to have the world come to an
2202,THE BROOK.,"end, with a grand final bang, while I was yet living and sentient on the"
2203,THE BROOK.,surface. I would like to be flashed out of being in the conglomerate of
2204,THE BROOK.,"a mighty swarm, like the covey of birds a huntsman's rifle brings down"
2205,THE BROOK.,or the multitude a Pompeiian doom overtakes. Such dying would be like
2206,THE BROOK.,"riding out of an electric-lighted station, by the car full, rather than"
2207,THE BROOK.,"sneaking a place on the back platform like a tramp. But after all, death"
2208,THE BROOK.,would not lose its awful individuality even then. Marshal the whole
2209,THE BROOK.,"world, and aim a single bullet at a hundred million souls, with power to"
2210,THE BROOK.,"still each pulse beat in the same rifle flash of time, yet each man"
2211,THE BROOK.,would die alone.
2212,THE BROOK.,
2213,THE BROOK.,There is one final lesson to be gained through the doleful contemplation
2214,THE BROOK.,"of the world's flood-tide of sorrow, and that is the lesson of how to"
2215,THE BROOK.,bear our troubles so as to react as little as possible upon those with
2216,THE BROOK.,whom life throws us in daily contact. Because the goblin bee has stung
2217,THE BROOK.,"our own souls, shall we seek to share the pain of its stateless sting"
2218,THE BROOK.,with all we meet? No more than we should endeavor to carry contagion in
2219,THE BROOK.,"our garments or put poison in our neighbor's well. I knew a man once, a"
2220,THE BROOK.,"gallant, light-hearted soldier, who honored the blue and brass of his"
2221,THE BROOK.,country's uniform by wearing it. An awful sorrow suddenly smote his
2222,THE BROOK.,"life, like an Indian sortie from an ambush. Wife and children were swept"
2223,THE BROOK.,from his arms by a swift disaster and he was left alone. His friends
2224,THE BROOK.,"said: ""He is a wrecked man! He will never lift his head again!"" How did"
2225,THE BROOK.,he fulfill this prophecy of woe? He entered the chamber of his darkened
2226,THE BROOK.,home and denied himself to everyone. He neither ate nor slept. He fought
2227,THE BROOK.,by himself a greater battle than call of bugle ever summoned to any
2228,THE BROOK.,"field. He mastered his own soul, and emerged from that chamber after a"
2229,THE BROOK.,certain number of days a conqueror over his own sorrow. His smile was as
2230,THE BROOK.,"ready, his heart as tender, his genial speech as welcome at home and"
2231,THE BROOK.,"abroad as it had ever been, and only when the goblin bee of memory stung"
2232,THE BROOK.,him in the silence of the companionless night did he live over again the
2233,THE BROOK.,"experience of his sorrow. None knew when that sting came, or how it"
2234,THE BROOK.,tarried; he bore it silently like a soldier and a man. The trifling
2235,THE BROOK.,"world called him light of love and easily consoled, but I think he was a"
2236,THE BROOK.,"grand, unselfish hero, a benefactor rather than a destroyer of mankind."
2237,THE BROOK.,
2238,THE BROOK.,When we get so that we can hide our sorrow in a smile we attain that
2239,THE BROOK.,attitude that brings us closest to the divine. The man or the woman who
2240,THE BROOK.,goes up and down the ways of the world with a groan on his lips and a
2241,THE BROOK.,weed on his arm is an infliction worse than an out of tune hand organ.
2242,THE BROOK.,"If the bee stings, hold still and bear the hurt by yourself as best you"
2243,THE BROOK.,"may, but don't talk it over with everyone you meet, like an old woman"
2244,THE BROOK.,petitioning a recipe for a bad cough and flaunting her physical ailments
2245,THE BROOK.,forever in your face. When you have bright things to talk about and
2246,THE BROOK.,"comforting things to say, talk; otherwise hold your peace. The reason, I"
2247,THE BROOK.,"think, why animals are never wrinkled and drawn of feature and gray like"
2248,THE BROOK.,mankind is because they cannot talk. If they had the power of speech
2249,THE BROOK.,"they would go around as humans do and disseminate unpleasant topics, as"
2250,THE BROOK.,idle winds start thistle pollen. Silence is golden when you can find
2251,THE BROOK.,nothing better to do than to clamor your own troubles; speech only is
2252,THE BROOK.,"blessed when, like a bird, it evolves a song or wings a feathered hope."
2253,THE BROOK.,
2254,THE BROOK.,"It seems hardly the thing to do, perhaps, to single out the unhappy"
2255,THE BROOK.,folks in a present world so full of jollity and talk with them awhile
2256,THE BROOK.,to-day. This bright autumn weather is so crowded with sights and sounds
2257,THE BROOK.,to dazzle and enchant that to obtrude the leaf of rue within the garland
2258,THE BROOK.,or breathe a minor tone into the music seems almost out of place. And
2259,THE BROOK.,"yet, for some reason or other, as I sit here at my desk to-day, the"
2260,THE BROOK.,thought of the hearts that are heavy in the midst of all the world's

2264,THE BROOK.,"Alas, for the goblin bee that stings, yet all too often may not ""state"

2266,THE BROOK.,"not theirs. It lies apart, we know not why, and evermore dips into"
2267,THE BROOK.,shadow and threads the dark defiles of gloom. There are so many more
2268,THE BROOK.,"reasons for being sorry than for being glad, we think. Try to count the"
2269,THE BROOK.,"causes for laughter, and then, over against them, set the reasons for"
2270,THE BROOK.,sorrow and see which way the balance falls. I take my seat on a bench
2271,THE BROOK.,out at the big show and watch the crowd for an hour. Do I see many faces
2272,THE BROOK.,"that do not bear the scar of the ""goblin bee""? From the little"
2273,THE BROOK.,four-year-old who is bitterly crying because somebody has jostled its
2274,THE BROOK.,"toy from its hand, to the woman whose eyes are sunken with sorrow"
2275,THE BROOK.,"because death has jostled the one whom she loved into his grave,"
2276,THE BROOK.,"everybody who passes, with but few exceptions, shows the scar of that"
2277,THE BROOK.,stateless sting.

2281,THE BROOK.,"Look at my window-garden, yonder! The sunshine, stealing in from the"
2282,THE BROOK.,"south, has wooed a dozen pansies into bloom--""Johnny-jump-ups,"" they"
2283,THE BROOK.,used to call them when I was a girl. How bright and cheery and chatty
2284,THE BROOK.,they look. We have those sort of faces (some of us) every day about our
2285,THE BROOK.,"breakfast tables. The little folks, God bless 'em! with their shining"
2286,THE BROOK.,"hair, their bright eyes, and the soft velvet of their cheeks, are the"
2287,THE BROOK.,"blessed heartsease of our home. And there is a fuchsia, turbaned like a"
2288,THE BROOK.,"Turk, behind the pansies. Just such sumptuous, graceful women we see"
2289,THE BROOK.,"every day. Like the fuchsia, they are beautiful and that is all. They"
2290,THE BROOK.,yield no fragrance. They attract the eye but fail to reach the heart.
2291,THE BROOK.,Who wouldn't rather have mignonette growing in the window? There is a
2292,THE BROOK.,yellow blossom in the window that reminds one of the patient shining of
2293,THE BROOK.,"certain homely souls I know, making sunshine in humble homes; cheerful"
2294,THE BROOK.,"old maid aunts, sweet-hearted elder sisters, yielding the honey of their"
2295,THE BROOK.,hearts to others. A cluster of fading violets sets me thinking of frail
2296,THE BROOK.,"invalids and the host of ""shut-in"" ones, whose delicate and dying beauty"
2297,THE BROOK.,fills our eyes with unstayed tears and our hearts with the shadow of

2305,THE BROOK.,"the temptation to do a mean thing; improve it, for it is in a hurry,"
2306,THE BROOK.,like a man whose ticket is bought and whose time is up. It won't be back
2307,THE BROOK.,"this way, either, for opportunities for good are not like tourists who"
2308,THE BROOK.,travel on return tickets. There is the opportunity to say a pleasant
2309,THE BROOK.,"word to your wife, sir, or you, madam, to your husband, instead of"
2310,THE BROOK.,"venting your temper and your ""nerves"" upon each other. Love's"
2311,THE BROOK.,opportunity travels by lightning express and has no time to dawdle

2317,THE BROOK.,"My dear, let me implore you, whatever else you let go, hold on to your"
2318,THE BROOK.,enthusiasm. Grow old if you must; grow white-headed and bent and
2319,THE BROOK.,"care-furrowed, if such must needs be the process of years, but don't"
2320,THE BROOK.,grow to be a stick. If you must pass on from the green time of your
2321,THE BROOK.,"freshness, change into sweet hay and keep your fragrance. If the cage"
2322,THE BROOK.,"must grow rusty and lose its brightness, there is a bird within, that it"
2323,THE BROOK.,were a pity to strangle to keep it from singing to the end. I don't care
2324,THE BROOK.,"how successful, or rich, or learned a man becomes, if he maintains a"
2325,THE BROOK.,"grim repression of all romance and enthusiasm, and what some hard old"
2326,THE BROOK.,"""Gradgrinds"" call the ""nonsense"" within him, he is nothing more than a"
2327,THE BROOK.,"fine cage with a dead bird in it. When I hear a person say of another,"
2328,THE BROOK.,"""Oh, he is a substantial fellow; no nonsense about him!"" I picture a"
2329,THE BROOK.,gold-fish in a glass globe. A glittering cuticle that covers anything so
2330,THE BROOK.,bloodless as the anatomy of a fish is not worth much. There are a good
2331,THE BROOK.,"many types of men to be detected, but the bloodless, emotionless,"
2332,THE BROOK.,"heart-paralytic, is the worst. Polish up a golden ball all you like. It"
2333,THE BROOK.,"may ornament your mantel, or serve as a useless bit of glitter in some"
2334,THE BROOK.,"corner, but when you begin to feel hungry and faint, and in need of"
2335,THE BROOK.,"solace and cheer, you will turn from the golden ball and pick up the"
2336,THE BROOK.,"veriest old rusty coat apple from an orchard's windfall, that has"
2337,THE BROOK.,"mellowed under summer noon, and sweetened in summer rains and dews,"
2338,THE BROOK.,"praising God for its flavor and its juices, even if you can buy forty"
2339,THE BROOK.,"bushels of its counterpart, for the price of one of your polished golden"
2340,THE BROOK.,"balls. Cultivate the ""nonsense"" in you, then, if it tends to enthusiasm"
2341,THE BROOK.,"of the right sort. It is the sympathy we get from people, the"
2342,THE BROOK.,"heartsomeness and cheer that keep our souls nourished, rather than the"
2343,THE BROOK.,"mere dazzle of intellectual attainment, or the greatness of any worldly"
2344,THE BROOK.,achievement. Heart rather than head; nature rather than art; genuineness
2345,THE BROOK.,rather than pretense; romance rather than absolute realism; enthusiasm
2346,THE BROOK.,"rather than petrifaction, will make a man rather than a gold fish, a"
2347,THE BROOK.,juicy apple rather than a ball of metallic and glittering nothingness.

2351,THE BROOK.,We were gathered at the Norfolk Station awaiting the train that was to
2352,THE BROOK.,carry us over the marshes to Virginia Beach and the sea. The crowd that
2353,THE BROOK.,surrounded us was very different from a Chicago crowd. There was no
2354,THE BROOK.,"pushing, no bold assertiveness, no elbows. There were lots of pretty"
2355,THE BROOK.,"women, and as for me everybody knows I simply adore the open sky, a tree"
2356,THE BROOK.,in blossom and a pretty woman. There were young girls with velvety brown
2357,THE BROOK.,eyes within whose dusky shadows one might look fathom deep as into a
2358,THE BROOK.,well of limpid water; girls with blue eyes like fringed gentians; women
2359,THE BROOK.,with grand free curves of figure that would have made Hebe look
2360,THE BROOK.,"commonplace; women with shapely shoulders and long, aristocratic hands,"
2361,THE BROOK.,tinted at the finger-tips as though fresh from picking ripe
2362,THE BROOK.,"strawberries; girls all in white (for the day was warm), like June"
2363,THE BROOK.,lilies; women with snowy teeth and adorable smiles to disclose them;
2364,THE BROOK.,"little tots of girls with braided hair and soft, questioning eyes;"
2365,THE BROOK.,"queenly girls, like tulips in bloom, all chatting together in subdued"
2366,THE BROOK.,but merry tones and laughing as delicately and airily as thrushes sing.
2367,THE BROOK.,"Oh, I lost my heart to you, my pretty southern maidens, and count the"
2368,THE BROOK.,time well spent I devoted to the contemplation of your many graces away

2373,THE BROOK.,If I was a liar and wanted to reform I shouldn't quit lying all at once.
2374,THE BROOK.,I would start out with a covenant to occasionally tell the truth. By and
2375,THE BROOK.,"by this spasmodic truth-telling, like the grain blown by the wind among"
2376,THE BROOK.,"stones, would, perhaps, yield sufficient harvest to send me not quite"
2377,THE BROOK.,empty-handed up to St. Peter's gate. If I drank whisky I would commence
2378,THE BROOK.,"to reform by swearing off on one glass out of three, and perhaps the"
2379,THE BROOK.,"manhood within me, having so much more chance to grow, would elbow its"
2380,THE BROOK.,way into heaven. If I was a gossip I would try to hold my tongue from
2381,THE BROOK.,"speaking evil half the time, and in that blissful interval perhaps my"
2382,THE BROOK.,dwarfed soul would get a start skyward. It is not by sudden achievement
2383,THE BROOK.,that we consummate a long journey. It is step by step and mile by mile
2384,THE BROOK.,"over a stony road that brings us to the goal, and it is not by mere"
2385,THE BROOK.,resolving that we renounce the old and attain unto the new. He who
2386,THE BROOK.,"travels but a few steps and keeps his face heavenward is on the way,"
2387,THE BROOK.,"and every small decision for the right, faithfully adhered to, is a"
2388,THE BROOK.,notable step toward a consummated journey.

2392,THE BROOK.,I am often struck with the selfishness displayed by people who are
2393,THE BROOK.,fortunate enough to be provided with umbrellas in time of sudden
2394,THE BROOK.,showers. They calmly behold hosts of unhappy beings battling their way
2395,THE BROOK.,"through the storm, drenched to the bone, and with ruined garments, yet"
2396,THE BROOK.,"never think of saying, ""Accept a share of my umbrella,"" or ""Walk with me"
2397,THE BROOK.,"as far as our ways lie together."" If I should hear such a speech I might"
2398,THE BROOK.,"drop senseless with surprise, but all the same I should hail it as the"
2399,THE BROOK.,bugle note that heralded a new era of courteous kindness.
2400,THE BROOK.,
2401,THE BROOK.,We are not put into the world to be suspicious of one another. We were
2402,THE BROOK.,"put here to make the world pleasanter for our tarrying, and to cultivate"
2403,THE BROOK.,"a fellowship with souls. If the guests at a mountain inn, sojourning"
2404,THE BROOK.,"together for a stormy night, spend the time in reviling one another, or"
2405,THE BROOK.,"in calling attention to each other's blemishes, we write them down as"
2406,THE BROOK.,snobs; but what shall we call the tenants of transitory time who spend
2407,THE BROOK.,the span of mortal life in doing all they can to make one another
2408,THE BROOK.,uncomfortable? We have only a watch in the night to tarry together; let
2409,THE BROOK.,us try to make that hour a profitable one and a pleasant memory for
2410,THE BROOK.,others when we have journeyed on.
2411,THE BROOK.,
2412,THE BROOK.,"I have often wondered how Christian people got round the gospel command,"
2413,THE BROOK.,"""Love thy neighbor as thyself."" It doesn't say love him (or her) after a"
2414,THE BROOK.,"proper introduction, or if agreeable, or congenial, or of good family"
2415,THE BROOK.,and established reputation--it simply gives the command on general
2416,THE BROOK.,principles. I don't pretend to be good enough to obey the mandate
2417,THE BROOK.,"myself, for I honestly think it is a species of hypocrisy to say you"
2418,THE BROOK.,"love everybody. One might as well say one were fond of all fruit alike,"
2419,THE BROOK.,"whether specked, wormy or rotten. But let my good orthodox professor put"
2420,THE BROOK.,this in his pipe and smoke it. Let him remember it next time he sees his
2421,THE BROOK.,"neighbor plunged into an extremity, or handicapped by an annoyance of"
2422,THE BROOK.,"any kind. If we love our neighbor we are bound to help him, and neighbor"
2423,THE BROOK.,"in this sense means anyone who chances to be near us, whether black or"
2424,THE BROOK.,"white, raggedly disreputable or sanctimoniously frilled."
2425,THE BROOK.,
2426,THE BROOK.,There is more selfishness perpetrated in the world under guise of family
2427,THE BROOK.,ties than in almost any other way. The man who does good and unselfish
2428,THE BROOK.,deeds only for his own children and for the immediate circle housed
2429,THE BROOK.,"beneath his roof, forgetful of the claims of the great, tormented,"
2430,THE BROOK.,"harassed and struggling world, is a selfish man and accountable to"
2431,THE BROOK.,heaven for a great deal of meanness. I don't care how much he puts on
2432,THE BROOK.,"his children's backs, or how many luxuries he surrounds them with, the"
2433,THE BROOK.,Lord will not hold him guiltless if he does nothing for the stranger who
2434,THE BROOK.,"tugs by him in the stress of life's uncertain weather, or for the"
2435,THE BROOK.,neighbor who sits disconsolate outside his gates.
2436,THE BROOK.,
2437,THE BROOK.,I wish that vagabond and his dog who were brought before a west side
2438,THE BROOK.,justice yesterday for vagrancy would travel up my way. I like that sort
2439,THE BROOK.,of thing that leads a man to be faithful to his dog. It goes without
2440,THE BROOK.,"saying that the dog is faithful to the man, but it is not often that the"
2441,THE BROOK.,master shows the same spirit to the fond and steadfast brute. If the two
2442,THE BROOK.,should journey my way I think they would have one white day in the
2443,THE BROOK.,"calendar. Good heavens, my dear, do you ever stop long enough in the"
2444,THE BROOK.,"midst of your golf-playing and your tennis tournaments, your yachtings"
2445,THE BROOK.,and your outings to think what it is to be a tramp? To be unable to find
2446,THE BROOK.,"a stroke of work; to be sick and starved and homeless! Like ""poor Joe,"""
2447,THE BROOK.,"to be told to ""move on"" every time you stop to rest; to eat the"
2448,THE BROOK.,"grudgingly given crust of charity, and have no friend under the sun,"
2449,THE BROOK.,"moon or stars but a flea-bitten dog? Did you ever stop to think, my"
2450,THE BROOK.,"Christian friend, that that tramp is a neighbor whom you are to love?"
2451,THE BROOK.,And if you are going to love him I will love his dog! No doubt the
2452,THE BROOK.,latter is the better man of the two.

2457,THE BROOK.,"full-armored warriors, resplendent in shining metal and plumed crests;"
2458,THE BROOK.,"there were the mighty battering rams, and the flash of battle axes, the"
2459,THE BROOK.,thunder of advancing feet and the trumpet call before the gates. But
2460,THE BROOK.,more potent than all else in the doomed city's destruction was the
2461,THE BROOK.,secret work of the sappers and miners--the patient forces which wrought
2462,THE BROOK.,"their work out of sight and hearing. And I have been thinking to-night,"
2463,THE BROOK.,"as I sit here, where the firelight weaves its delicate tapestry within"
2464,THE BROOK.,"the beautiful walls of home, that it is not going to be the pompous ones"
2465,THE BROOK.,"who shall march triumphant at last into the ""City of Gold,"" but they who"
2466,THE BROOK.,have worked patiently and humbly out of sight and with no need of
2467,THE BROOK.,"praise. The man who has held to the dictates of his own conscience, not"
2468,THE BROOK.,conforming to the company he marched with; the man who has dared to be
2469,THE BROOK.,himself in a world where men are labeled in lots; the man who has held
2470,THE BROOK.,it high honor to suffer for a principle or to be loyal to an unpopular
2471,THE BROOK.,friend or cause; the man who has erected a standard made up between his
2472,THE BROOK.,"own heart and heaven, and, independent of the world's verdict of praise"
2473,THE BROOK.,"or blame, followed it to the end, is going to wear a crown by and by,"
2474,THE BROOK.,when the epauletted general and the pompous staff are forgotten. Prayer
2475,THE BROOK.,is not always a genuflexion and an address. It is oftener hard work. The
2476,THE BROOK.,"farmer praying at his weeds, the pilot praying from every spoke of his"
2477,THE BROOK.,"wheel, the mother whose daily life of unselfish toil and far-reaching"
2478,THE BROOK.,"influence is a prayer, do more to stir the divine heart, to keep the"
2479,THE BROOK.,world's prow headed for heaven than half the solicitations or
2480,THE BROOK.,apologetic addresses made in our churches under the name of prayer.

2487,THE BROOK.,"who through good heartedness, or lack of forethought or unselfish desire"
2488,THE BROOK.,"to make other folks happy, have never laid by a cent, and we will give"
2489,THE BROOK.,those silly people such a good time they will carry its impress all
2490,THE BROOK.,"through their after lives, as a pat of butter carries the print. We will"
2491,THE BROOK.,slyly pay the bills for improvident ones who have grown gray in the
2492,THE BROOK.,effort to make a decent funeral for dead horses. They shall forget how
2493,THE BROOK.,"to spell ""care"" and their new and happy dialect shall know no such words"
2494,THE BROOK.,"as ""monthly payments,"" ""righteous dues"" or ""can't afford it."" I am"
2495,THE BROOK.,convinced that as a rule it is not the sweet-hearted people who take on
2496,THE BROOK.,this world's gain. There is many a poor beggar with not a change of
2497,THE BROOK.,"linen to his back who would make a more royal host, had the smiling"
2498,THE BROOK.,"face of fortune turned his way, than the rightful owner of the vast"
2499,THE BROOK.,estates at whose gate he stands and begs. The big hearts too often go
2500,THE BROOK.,"with the empty purse, and the little, wizened, skin-flint souls, that it"

2513,THE BROOK.,"Or is there a nearer one yet and a dearer, from whom I could buy or"
2514,THE BROOK.,"borrow a pair of stockings that I may go in bathing?"" He didn't"

2516,THE BROOK.,"matter clear so that he got me a pair of canary-striped woolen hose,"
2517,THE BROOK.,"evidently laid by for some farmer's winter use, and I bought them for a"

2587,THE BROOK.,Yonder goes a small and worthless yellow dog. He is young; you can tell
2588,THE BROOK.,"that from the abnormal size of his paws, and a certain remnant of"
2589,THE BROOK.,"wistful trust in human kind, which displays itself in the furtive wag of"
2590,THE BROOK.,his tail and the cock of his limp and discouraged ear. He is as
2591,THE BROOK.,absolutely friendless as anything to which God has granted life can be.
2592,THE BROOK.,Of his existence there is no thought in the mind of any man or woman
2593,THE BROOK.,"beneath the stars. The boys grow mindful of him now and then, though,"
2594,THE BROOK.,and their manifested interest has made of his life one terrible specter
2595,THE BROOK.,of cringing fear. He hears the hurrah of their cruel chase in every tone
2596,THE BROOK.,of sudden speech; he sees the menace of a blow in every shadow. Do you
2597,THE BROOK.,"know, my dear, that I never spoke a truer word in all my life than when"
2598,THE BROOK.,I say that underneath the hide of that forlorn and friendless little
2599,THE BROOK.,yellow dog there is something more valuable than beats under the
2600,THE BROOK.,broadcloth vests and silken waists of many of the men and women who pass
2601,THE BROOK.,"him by! A grateful heart mindful of the smallest kindnesses, a faithful"
2602,THE BROOK.,instinct which keeps dogs loyal even to cruel masters. I sometimes think
2603,THE BROOK.,I would rather take my chances with honest dogs than with half the men
2604,THE BROOK.,who own them. They may not be able to pass up the stamped ticket which
2605,THE BROOK.,transfers the human passenger from the earthly to the celestial railroad
2606,THE BROOK.,and carries him through on the passport of an immortal soul; but no
2607,THE BROOK.,"ticket at all is quite as good as a forged or fraudulent one, as some of"

2615,THE BROOK.,"dreams without which a man's life is like bread without leaven, or a"
2616,THE BROOK.,"laid fire without tinder. I don't like noisy people, do you? People who"
2617,THE BROOK.,talk and bluster and swagger. People who remind us of bladders filled to

2621,THE BROOK.,much greater demand there is for bluster than there is for force.
2622,THE BROOK.,Sometimes I am inclined to think that life is a farce played with an

2658,WHAT I MISS.,My hungry heart will claim them still;

2665,WHAT I MISS.,The other day my strolling took me into a second-hand furniture shop. I
2666,WHAT I MISS.,"wanted to find an ice chest. ""Have you any second-hand chests?"" I asked"
2667,WHAT I MISS.,of the hoary-headed son of Erin who tended the place and raked in the
2668,WHAT I MISS.,"shekels. He didn't answer a word, but silently arose and beckoned me to"
2669,WHAT I MISS.,follow. Through ranks of withered tables and blighted chairs I picked my
2670,WHAT I MISS.,way until my guide dived down a gruesome stairway and then I stopped.
2671,WHAT I MISS.,Presently his head emerged like a grimy Jack-in-the-box.
2672,WHAT I MISS.,
2673,WHAT I MISS.,"""Is it an ice chist yez want?"" asked he. There was mold on his faded"
2674,WHAT I MISS.,cheeks and a cobweb on his brow as he awaited my answer.
2675,WHAT I MISS.,
2676,WHAT I MISS.,"""Must I go down there to find it?"" I inquired. He replied in the"
2677,WHAT I MISS.,affirmative.
2678,WHAT I MISS.,
2679,WHAT I MISS.,"""Old man, I will go no further,"" said I, ""but come back here and tell me"
2680,WHAT I MISS.,"the price of this lovely desk."" So saying, I designated a delightful old"
2681,WHAT I MISS.,"claw-handled, brass-mounted, spider-legged piece of furniture, which"
2682,WHAT I MISS.,might have been used by Adam to cast up his accounts on. There was a
2683,WHAT I MISS.,suggestion of secret drawers about it that was quite ravishing. The
2684,WHAT I MISS.,"doors were oddly shaped little panes of mirror glass, within which I"
2685,WHAT I MISS.,"gazed pensively at a soot blemish on my nose. ""Is it the price of that"
2686,WHAT I MISS.,"yez'd be afther knowing?"" said the old man, in the tone of one who dealt"
2687,WHAT I MISS.,"with a harmless lunatic. ""I thought it was ice chists yez was afther."""
2688,WHAT I MISS.,"""Yes,"" said I, drawing out two long slabs as I spoke, such as were used"
2689,WHAT I MISS.,to support the shelf of the desk I remembered in my grandmother's house.
2690,WHAT I MISS.,"""That bit of furnichoor,"" said the old-man, gazing sadly meanwhile at"
2691,WHAT I MISS.,"the grime of ages which I could not rub from off my nose, ""is more than"
2692,WHAT I MISS.,"two hundred years old."" He stopped for a moment to see if I would"
2693,WHAT I MISS.,"believe him, then went on: ""Yis, ma'am, that same is nearer three"
2694,WHAT I MISS.,"hundred years old, all told."""
2695,WHAT I MISS.,
2696,WHAT I MISS.,Here I gave him a look which stopped him at the threshold of the fourth
2697,WHAT I MISS.,century.
2698,WHAT I MISS.,
2699,WHAT I MISS.,"""Yez may have it for $25,"" says he."
2700,WHAT I MISS.,
2701,WHAT I MISS.,"""I'll give you five,"" says I."
2702,WHAT I MISS.,
2703,WHAT I MISS.,He turned away as one who found his mother tongue inadequate to express
2704,WHAT I MISS.,the deep-seated scorn of his soul. I followed.
2705,WHAT I MISS.,
2706,WHAT I MISS.,"""Did yez say twenty?"" he asked stopping abruptly and facing me with the"
2707,WHAT I MISS.,blurred photograph of what was once an engaging smile.
2708,WHAT I MISS.,
2709,WHAT I MISS.,"""I said five,"" I answered."
2710,WHAT I MISS.,
2711,WHAT I MISS.,"""Well, take it thin,"" said he, ""but it would be dirt chape at fifty."
2712,WHAT I MISS.,"It's not a day less than four hun--"""
2713,WHAT I MISS.,
2714,WHAT I MISS.,"""Stop,"" said I, ""if you add another century I'll only pay you two and a"
2715,WHAT I MISS.,"half for it."""
2716,WHAT I MISS.,
2717,WHAT I MISS.,And so to-night it comes to pass that I am writing at my new old desk. I
2718,WHAT I MISS.,"am half conscious, as my pencil glides along the paper, of a laughing"
2719,WHAT I MISS.,"face, half-hidden by showers of falling hair, that flickers like a"
2720,WHAT I MISS.,"shadow in and out of the soft gloom that enfolds me. Fingers, light as"
2721,WHAT I MISS.,"air, seem to follow the motion of my own, and the ghost of the mistress"
2722,WHAT I MISS.,"who thought and wrote at this same desk, one, two, three, four hundred"
2723,WHAT I MISS.,"years ago, seems whispering in my ear. I wonder what will be the effect"
2724,WHAT I MISS.,"if I read to that sweet, gentle woman of ""ye olden time"" a few bits from"
2725,WHAT I MISS.,the morning paper.
2726,WHAT I MISS.,
2727,WHAT I MISS.,"Madam, are you aware that a man kicked his wife to death yesterday"

2729,WHAT I MISS.,congratulated that you are out of reach of this latter day development
2730,WHAT I MISS.,of the human brute? Do you know that the Blank concerts began this last
2731,WHAT I MISS.,"week, and that the melodies that throng the beautiful hall yonder on the"
2732,WHAT I MISS.,avenue are like bands of singing angels charming a world's sorrows to
2733,WHAT I MISS.,rest? Do not the gentle caprices of the flutes and the swing of the
2734,WHAT I MISS.,"fiddles make even you, flake of airy nothingness that you are! dance"
2735,WHAT I MISS.,"like a thistle-down in a summer breeze? Madam, do you know, and how"
2736,WHAT I MISS.,"does it affect you to know, that there are bargain sales in town where"
2737,WHAT I MISS.,"you can buy a gown for a song, and a pair of all-wool blankets for the"
2738,WHAT I MISS.,worth of a dream? In your long time disembodied state have you yet
2739,WHAT I MISS.,"reached a point, I wonder, when such news as this can no longer thrill a"
2740,WHAT I MISS.,"woman's heart? If so, madam, you are truly and undeniably dead, and your"
2741,WHAT I MISS.,room is better than your company. I bid you a gentle good evening.

2746,WHAT I MISS.,"in spite of heroic effort to keep it straight, my hat always gets"
2747,WHAT I MISS.,crooked and my hair becomes disordered on the march. I thoroughly detest
2748,WHAT I MISS.,"the sight of a typical ""blue-stocking,"" or a literary woman who affects"
2749,WHAT I MISS.,"a sublime superiority to appearances, and yet Mrs. Jellyby was nowhere"
2750,WHAT I MISS.,as to general demoralization of raiment compared to my unfortunate self.
2751,WHAT I MISS.,"Taking my seat in a down-town restaurant the other day, I found myself"
2752,WHAT I MISS.,surrounded by half a dozen girls as bright and pretty and jolly as
2753,WHAT I MISS.,girls go. No sooner was I seated than the whisper went round that a
2754,WHAT I MISS.,"newspaper woman had invaded the party. ""Looks like one,"" murmured the"
2755,WHAT I MISS.,"plumpest one of the lot, and I could have cried. ""Girls,"" I wanted to"
2756,WHAT I MISS.,"say, ""judge not by appearances. The best christians sometimes have red"
2757,WHAT I MISS.,"noses, just as the jolliest literary folks have frowsy hair and"
2758,WHAT I MISS.,"abandoned hats. They can't help it, my dears, any more than a black cat"
2759,WHAT I MISS.,"can help being somber. It is never safe to condemn anybody, not even a"
2760,WHAT I MISS.,"poor, miserable scribbler for the press, on circumstantial evidence. You"
2761,WHAT I MISS.,"see a crooked hat, electric hair, and that is all. Put on Titbottom"
2762,WHAT I MISS.,spectacles and look deeper. Perhaps you will then see an
2763,WHAT I MISS.,anguish-stricken woman rising at 5 a. m. to make herself smart for the
2764,WHAT I MISS.,day. You will note how carefully she adjusts the feeble adjuncts to her
2765,WHAT I MISS.,"toilet, how she places her hat on straight and secures it with a"
2766,WHAT I MISS.,cast-iron cable! How she combs out her curls and sticks a feathery
2767,WHAT I MISS.,kerchief within her belt. Two hours later the cable hat-pin has been
2768,WHAT I MISS.,struck by a tidal-wave and swept from its anchorage; the curls have
2769,WHAT I MISS.,degenerated into wisps of wind-tossed hay; and the kerchief? Gone as a
2770,WHAT I MISS.,"feather is gone when the summer tempest gets behind it! We mean well,"
2771,WHAT I MISS.,girls. We want to look trim and slick and span. All of us poor literary
2772,WHAT I MISS.,"people do, but we can't bring it about. Life is so everlastingly full,"
2773,WHAT I MISS.,"anyway, that it seems preposterous to spend more than half one's time in"
2774,WHAT I MISS.,getting fixed up. Sometimes I am foolish enough to believe that good St.
2775,WHAT I MISS.,"Peter, when we come toiling up to his gate, won't look so much to the"
2776,WHAT I MISS.,condition of our hats and our hair as he will to the way we wear our
2777,WHAT I MISS.,souls. If they are tip-tilted and frowsy it may go a little bit hard
2778,WHAT I MISS.,"with us. Of course, it is a good thing to be able to wear a hat"
2779,WHAT I MISS.,"straight, and be remarked for your pretty hair and generally pleasing"
2780,WHAT I MISS.,"appearance, but I declare to you if it comes to a question of mental"
2781,WHAT I MISS.,"array and soul-correction as opposed to style and good form, I am"

2809,WHAT I MISS.,"If you expect to escape criticism, girls, in this world, you will put"
2810,WHAT I MISS.,yourselves very much in the plight of flower-roots that expect to grow
2811,WHAT I MISS.,without the discipline of the hoe. Before we can amount to anything
2812,WHAT I MISS.,"either in blossom or as fruit, we must undergo much honest criticism,"
2813,WHAT I MISS.,and of such we need never be afraid. A candid and above-board enemy is
2814,WHAT I MISS.,"of far more benefit, often, than a timid friend, who, seeing our faults,"
2815,WHAT I MISS.,is afraid to tell us of them. The fact that boys stone certain trees and
2816,WHAT I MISS.,"pass others by, is explained when we find that the stones are always"
2817,WHAT I MISS.,thrown at the fruit-bearing trees. And so with character; the fact that
2818,WHAT I MISS.,we are criticized proves that we are something better than scrub-oak
2819,WHAT I MISS.,"saplings. But all criticism that does not make us grow, and put forth"
2820,WHAT I MISS.,"fairer and richer blossoms, is like a hoe made of wood, or a cultivator"
2821,WHAT I MISS.,without power applied to cause it to destroy the weeds. If the unanimous
2822,WHAT I MISS.,"verdict of the community in which we live asserts that we are proud, or"
2823,WHAT I MISS.,"ill-natured, or lazy, we may be pretty sure that there is some cause"
2824,WHAT I MISS.,"for the application of that particular stroke of the hoe, and the sooner"

2826,WHAT I MISS.,crop of blossoms. Nobody (save One) was ever yet maligned without some
2827,WHAT I MISS.,little cause. Those who come in contact with you at home may not see
2828,WHAT I MISS.,little blemishes upon your conduct or character which those who meet you
2829,WHAT I MISS.,"in business may detect. For instance, to the folks at home you never put"
2830,WHAT I MISS.,on that indifferent and languid air to which you treat the customer who
2831,WHAT I MISS.,"drops in to buy ribbon, or the woman who asks you a question at your"
2832,WHAT I MISS.,office desk. The customer and the questioner go away with an estimate of
2833,WHAT I MISS.,"your behavior very unlike the one held at home, where you are frank and"
2834,WHAT I MISS.,"cheerful, and willing to please. And, on the other hand, the party with"
2835,WHAT I MISS.,"whom you associate casually in business, or with whom you ride daily to"
2836,WHAT I MISS.,"and from your office and your home, has no conception how snappy and"
2837,WHAT I MISS.,snarly you can be when none but familiar ears are open to your surly
2838,WHAT I MISS.,complaints.
2839,WHAT I MISS.,
2840,WHAT I MISS.,"The statement from your little brother or sister that you are a ""cross"
2841,WHAT I MISS.,"old thing"" would hardly be believed by those who meet you away from"
2842,WHAT I MISS.,home. And yet the hoe in the little hands strikes at a weed that
2843,WHAT I MISS.,"threatens to make havoc in the garden. Better look to it, dearie, before"
2844,WHAT I MISS.,the ugly thing quite overtops the mignonette and the pinks! Whenever you
2845,WHAT I MISS.,hear of an adverse criticism set to find the weed somewhere in your
2846,WHAT I MISS.,character. I believe firmly that every one of us was born into the world
2847,WHAT I MISS.,with capabilities for almost every evil under the sun if environment
2848,WHAT I MISS.,"favors the development. Like a garden patch, the roots of the weeds lie"
2849,WHAT I MISS.,"already deep, the flower seeds must be sown. And no gardener ever"
2850,WHAT I MISS.,"struggled with ""pusley"" and burdock as we must struggle with the evil"
2851,WHAT I MISS.,"crop, heredity-sown. Thanks be to the quick eye, then, be it of friend"
2852,WHAT I MISS.,"or foe, who discerns the weed before we do, and whips out the hoe to"
2853,WHAT I MISS.,attack it. We are not exactly pleased when it is borne in upon us
2854,WHAT I MISS.,"through the criticism of some acquaintance or neighbor, that we are"
2855,WHAT I MISS.,"selfish in little things. Our folks don't say so, and we try to believe"
2856,WHAT I MISS.,the charge is a libel. Next time you throw your banana skin heedlessly
2857,WHAT I MISS.,"on the pavement, or crowd into a seat without a ""by your leave,"" or"
2858,WHAT I MISS.,"refuse to move up in a crowded car, or open your window without asking"
2859,WHAT I MISS.,"if it be agreeable to the person behind you, or eat peanuts and throw"
2860,WHAT I MISS.,"the shucks on the floor instead of out of the window, or see a lady"
2861,WHAT I MISS.,"going by with a disarranged dress and don't tell her of it, or return an"
2862,WHAT I MISS.,"indifferent answer to a civil question, or refuse the sweet service of a"
2863,WHAT I MISS.,smile and a gentle look to the humblest wayfarer that jostles you on the
2864,WHAT I MISS.,"road, just remember the criticism, and see if there is not occasion for"
2865,WHAT I MISS.,"it. Set about correcting the little faults, and the great ones leave to"
2866,WHAT I MISS.,"God. He will keep you, no doubt, from theft, and murder, and perjury,"
2867,WHAT I MISS.,but you don't ask or seem to stand in need of His help in getting rid of
2868,WHAT I MISS.,"temptations to be mean and selfish, and discourteous and lazy."
2869,WHAT I MISS.,
2870,WHAT I MISS.,What would you think of a gardener who went about with a spade seeking
2871,WHAT I MISS.,"to exterminate nothing but Canada thistles, and let all the rest of the"
2872,WHAT I MISS.,weeds go? It is not often that so big and determinate a thing as a
2873,WHAT I MISS.,"Canada thistle gets in among the roses, and when it does it is quickly"
2874,WHAT I MISS.,"disposed of. But oh, the wee growths! The tiny shoots that come up"
2875,WHAT I MISS.,"faster than flies swarm in dog-days, and need to be forever stood over"
2876,WHAT I MISS.,against with a steady hand and a hoe. If my neighbor comes out and
2877,WHAT I MISS.,"charges me with stealing a barrel of flour from her storehouse, or"
2878,WHAT I MISS.,"attacking her first-born with a meat-axe, I can quickly disprove that"
2879,WHAT I MISS.,sort of a charge; but when she says that I am unprincipled because I
2880,WHAT I MISS.,steal in and coax her girl away from her with the offer of higher
2881,WHAT I MISS.,wages--how is that? Or that I am selfish because she sees me let my old
2882,WHAT I MISS.,"mother wait on me to what I am able to get myself; or cross, because I"
2883,WHAT I MISS.,"am untender to the children; or untruthful, because I instruct the"
2884,WHAT I MISS.,"servant to say I am ""not at home"" when I am, how am I going to dispose"
2885,WHAT I MISS.,"of those charges? Sure as you live, there are weeds in front of such hoe"
2886,WHAT I MISS.,"strokes, and with heaven's help we'll get rid of 'em."
2887,WHAT I MISS.,
2888,WHAT I MISS.,"Cultivate your critics, then, provided they be honest and fair-dealing."
2889,WHAT I MISS.,Avoid only such as strike in the dark. The man who goes out to hoe weeds
2890,WHAT I MISS.,"in the night time is not to be trusted, and the enemy who resorts to the"
2891,WHAT I MISS.,"underhand methods of backbiting and scandal to do his work, is not worth"
2892,WHAT I MISS.,"talking about, much less heeding. Take criticism that is fair and open,"
2893,WHAT I MISS.,"as you occasionally take quinine, to tone up the system and dissipate"
2894,WHAT I MISS.,the malaria of sloth and inertia. Only they shall come into the

2902,WHAT I MISS.,"""My fairest child, I have no song to give you;"
2903,WHAT I MISS.,No lark could pipe 'neath skies so dull and gray;

2906,WHAT I MISS.,
2907,WHAT I MISS.,"""Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever;"
2908,WHAT I MISS.,"Do noble things, not dream them, all day long,"
2909,WHAT I MISS.,"And so make life, death and that vast forever"
2910,WHAT I MISS.,"One grand, sweet song."""

2914,WHAT I MISS.,See that half-grown man? He never will know as much again as he does now
2915,WHAT I MISS.,"at the ripe age of twenty. When he gets to be fifty, when his hair is"
2916,WHAT I MISS.,grizzled and his hopes are like the dead leaves that cling to November
2917,WHAT I MISS.,"trees, he will look back upon these years of rare wisdom and colossal"
2918,WHAT I MISS.,"effrontery and blush a little, perhaps, at the recollection. Now he has"
2919,WHAT I MISS.,no reverence for a woman or for God. He sneers at good in a world whose
2920,WHAT I MISS.,"threshold he has barely crossed, as a year-old child might stand in the"
2921,WHAT I MISS.,doorway of his nursery and denounce what was going on in the
2922,WHAT I MISS.,drawing-room. Most of the scathing things that are said about domestic
2923,WHAT I MISS.,"felicity, and the sneers that are bestowed on love, and the gibes that"
2924,WHAT I MISS.,"are flung at purity, and the scoffs that are launched at established"
2925,WHAT I MISS.,religions; all the jokes at the expense of noble womanhood and the
2926,WHAT I MISS.,"witticisms that are lavished upon the old-fashioned virtues, spring from"
2927,WHAT I MISS.,the gigantic brain of the youth of the period.

2931,WHAT I MISS.,Often as I pass along the streets of this town I notice certain places
2932,WHAT I MISS.,"which I do not burn down, nor tear down, nor otherwise demolish, merely"
2933,WHAT I MISS.,because of inherent cowardice and inadequate strength. If I had a
2934,WHAT I MISS.,"wide-awake, growing boy I would no more turn him loose in your town, Mr."
2935,WHAT I MISS.,"Alderman, than I would cut his throat with my own hand. Not, certainly,"
2936,WHAT I MISS.,"if there was a spark of human nature within him, and a boy without such"
2937,WHAT I MISS.,"a spark is hardly worth raising. And more than that, I will say this,"
2938,WHAT I MISS.,"that what with your saloons and your wide-open gambling resorts, and"
2939,WHAT I MISS.,"your doorways of hell, wherein sit spiders luring flies, it has come to"
2940,WHAT I MISS.,pass that every mother whose boy encounters harm thereby should be
2941,WHAT I MISS.,entitled to damages at least as great as juries award a careless
2942,WHAT I MISS.,pedestrian who gets his legs cut off at a railway crossing. You say that
2943,WHAT I MISS.,"laws are inadequate to cope with evils of this kind; if that is so, then"
2944,WHAT I MISS.,"an outraged citizenhood should rise superior to law, and enter upon a"
2945,WHAT I MISS.,crusade to destroy the infamous dens that decoy our boys. On a certain
2946,WHAT I MISS.,"downtown street there is a newly opened resort, the windows of which are"
2947,WHAT I MISS.,"closely draped, and before the door of which a placard is suspended"
2948,WHAT I MISS.,which invites only men to enter within. Now and then a hideously ugly
2949,WHAT I MISS.,"man, with a yellow beard, comes to the ticket window and looks out like"
2950,WHAT I MISS.,"a tarantula from its hole, but in the main the place seems absolutely"
2951,WHAT I MISS.,unfrequented.
2952,WHAT I MISS.,
2953,WHAT I MISS.,"Take your stand and watch for awhile, though, and you will see young men"
2954,WHAT I MISS.,"and small boys, old men and slouching reprobates of all conditions and"
2955,WHAT I MISS.,colors going in and coming out by dozens. Why doesn't some good citizen
2956,WHAT I MISS.,enter a complaint of that place and break it up? We would pounce upon a
2957,WHAT I MISS.,"smallpox case soon enough wherever it might lurk, but we are strangely"
2958,WHAT I MISS.,indifferent where the menace is only to the soul.
2959,WHAT I MISS.,
2960,WHAT I MISS.,How can we expect to keep our boys pure and raise them to lives of
2961,WHAT I MISS.,usefulness when such iniquitous places are run wide open on public
2962,WHAT I MISS.,"streets at noonday, granting admission to all masculinity between the"
2963,WHAT I MISS.,ages of 7 and 70?
2964,WHAT I MISS.,
2965,WHAT I MISS.,A well-guarded youth is supposed to be at home in the night time and not
2966,WHAT I MISS.,to be frequenting shy neighborhoods at any hour. So that we might feel
2967,WHAT I MISS.,comparatively safe about the boy we send out into the world at an early
2968,WHAT I MISS.,age to begin his career as errand boy or messenger if these pernicious
2969,WHAT I MISS.,decoys were maintained only at night and in low vicinities. When the
2970,WHAT I MISS.,"trap is set, however, right in the business center of the town by"
2971,WHAT I MISS.,"daylight, what safety have we? Whenever I look into the face of an"
2972,WHAT I MISS.,"eager, bright, curious, thoroughly alive boy I feel like shaking every"
2973,WHAT I MISS.,other duty of life and going forth to do battle with the devil for that
2974,WHAT I MISS.,lad's soul.
2975,WHAT I MISS.,
2976,WHAT I MISS.,Why should evil have so much greater chance than good? For one reason I
2977,WHAT I MISS.,don't believe we make the good attractive enough. The devil has stolen
2978,WHAT I MISS.,the trademark of light for half his wares. Why not have more fun and
2979,WHAT I MISS.,frolic in the home? Why not add a gymnasium and dancing hall to the
2980,WHAT I MISS.,Sunday school and filter some of the world's innocent sunshine inside
2981,WHAT I MISS.,"its gloomy walls? Why may not the eager, active heart of youth find its"
2982,WHAT I MISS.,good cheer and jollity somewhere else than in forbidden places and among
2983,WHAT I MISS.,smooth and unscrupulous knaves? If we made our churches less austere and
2984,WHAT I MISS.,"their gatherings more alluring to the young, these low and vicious"
2985,WHAT I MISS.,resorts might close for lack of patronage.
2986,WHAT I MISS.,
2987,WHAT I MISS.,"God bless the boys. I love them next best to girls, and sometimes even a"
2988,WHAT I MISS.,"little better, when they are especially frank and brave and true. I am"
2989,WHAT I MISS.,"not going to see them harmed without a protest, either, and I would be"
2990,WHAT I MISS.,one of a crowd this very day to march upon the resorts of evil that lie
2991,WHAT I MISS.,"in wait, all over town, to destroy the bonnie fellows. If I had my way,"
2992,WHAT I MISS.,every man or woman who makes money by pandering to the curiosity of a
2993,WHAT I MISS.,"boy's nature, inciting to unworthy passion by means of lewd pictures"
2994,WHAT I MISS.,"and the like, should be consigned to instant perdition. The earth is too"
2995,WHAT I MISS.,hallowed to receive their vile dust!

3000,WHAT I MISS.,"in heaven, first of all be natural. Be true to something within you"
3001,WHAT I MISS.,higher than any conventional code or worldly wise mandate. If it is your
3002,WHAT I MISS.,"natural impulse to be courteous, and sympathetic, and sweet (and blessed"
3003,WHAT I MISS.,"be the fact, it is the natural impulse of most girls so to be!), don't"
3004,WHAT I MISS.,let miserable conformity and its tricksters exchange your genuine
3005,WHAT I MISS.,"blossom for a mere shred of painted muslin, fashioned though it be after"
3006,WHAT I MISS.,even so perfect a similitude of a rose. The birds of the air nor the
3007,WHAT I MISS.,"angels in heaven will ever be fooled by any artificial rose, let me tell"
3008,WHAT I MISS.,"you, however much dudes and society feather-heads may pretend to desire"
3009,WHAT I MISS.,it. Grow for something better than this world; wear your sweetness in

3013,WHAT I MISS.,
3014,WHAT I MISS.,The great drawback to domestic felicity often lies in the fact that we
3015,WHAT I MISS.,get too familiar with one another. There should be a certain reserve in
3016,WHAT I MISS.,the most intimate relationships. Sisters and brothers have no right to
3017,WHAT I MISS.,burst into one another's private rooms without knocking. Wives have no
3018,WHAT I MISS.,more right to search their husband's pockets than they have to do the
3019,WHAT I MISS.,same little service for a distant acquaintance. I have no right to read
3020,WHAT I MISS.,"the Young Person's letters without permission, although I have a right"
3021,WHAT I MISS.,to win her confidence so that she shows them freely. The Captain has no
3022,WHAT I MISS.,more right to visit the Boy's bank for pennies because he is her
3023,WHAT I MISS.,"brother, than she has to abstract money from the grocery-man's till. You"
3024,WHAT I MISS.,"have no more right to obtrude your conversation upon your wife, nor she"
3025,WHAT I MISS.,"upon her husband, when either is in the middle of a thrilling story,"
3026,WHAT I MISS.,than you or she would have to interrupt the Queen of England at her
3027,WHAT I MISS.,"devotions. An ""excuse me,"" if a mother is obliged to interrupt her"
3028,WHAT I MISS.,"youngest child's babble, is quite as good a way to teach the baby"
3029,WHAT I MISS.,manners as a course of lectures later on etiquette. The man who gets up
3030,WHAT I MISS.,and slams shut the ventilator in a crowded car to suit his own
3031,WHAT I MISS.,"convenience, or the woman who throws open a car-window regardless of the"
3032,WHAT I MISS.,"occupants of the seat behind her, is no ruder than Bess is when she"
3033,WHAT I MISS.,"ignores brother Tom's comfort at home, or Tom is when he pounces for the"
3034,WHAT I MISS.,biggest orange on the plate when only Bess and he are at table. When
3035,WHAT I MISS.,"either makes rude remarks to the other, they sin against the true code"
3036,WHAT I MISS.,of etiquette more than when they are discourteous at a party or
3037,WHAT I MISS.,"boisterously unkind with a comrade, just as he is more criminally"
3038,WHAT I MISS.,careless who pounds a piano to pieces with a hammer than he who batters
3039,WHAT I MISS.,"the pine case it was brought in. The greater the value of the article,"
3040,WHAT I MISS.,"the choicer we are supposed to be of it, and in the same line of"
3041,WHAT I MISS.,"argument, the dearer and closer the tie that binds us, the more"
3042,WHAT I MISS.,considerate we should be in the handling of it. I may hurt the feelings
3043,WHAT I MISS.,"of a society acquaintance, and there is restitution and forgiveness, but"
3044,WHAT I MISS.,"when I stab the dear old mother's heart with an unkind word, or wound my"
3045,WHAT I MISS.,"child's feelings with an injustice or a cruelty, or ridicule the"
3046,WHAT I MISS.,"sensitive feelings of a brother or a sister, not eternity itself shall"
3047,WHAT I MISS.,be long enough to extract the sting from my memory when my dear ones are
3048,WHAT I MISS.,dead and love's opportunity is vanished forever.

3070,WHAT I MISS.,brooding dove? Where were you the other night when out of the sullen

3076,WHAT I MISS.,No law of morals should be less arbitrary for men than it is for women.
3077,WHAT I MISS.,"An impure heart, a riotous appetite, a profane tongue, are no more"
3078,WHAT I MISS.,excusable in a man than they are in a woman. If a man is supposed to
3079,WHAT I MISS.,shrink from selecting his wife among the unclean in thought and immoral
3080,WHAT I MISS.,"of practice, why should not a young girl be allowed an undefiled"
3081,WHAT I MISS.,selection? When girls grow so queenly natured that they demand that
3082,WHAT I MISS.,their lover should be of the royal stock and never demean themselves to
3083,WHAT I MISS.,stoop to mate with impurity and profligacy just because it carries a
3084,WHAT I MISS.,"handsome face and a well-filled pocketbook, there will be some chance"
3085,WHAT I MISS.,for happiness in the married estate. It is this placing white flowers in
3086,WHAT I MISS.,"smutty buttonholes, or, in other words, the wedding of pure women to"
3087,WHAT I MISS.,"blasé and wicked men, that sows the seed of the tare in what was meant"
3088,WHAT I MISS.,by the primal law to be a harvest of golden grain. Do you pick
3089,WHAT I MISS.,slug-eaten roses and wind-fall blossoms? When you go forth to buy
3090,WHAT I MISS.,material for a new gown do you choose cotton warp fabrics and colors
3091,WHAT I MISS.,that will fade in the first washing? Your answers to all these question
3092,WHAT I MISS.,"are prompt enough, but when I ask you what choice you make of gentlemen"
3093,WHAT I MISS.,"friends, you are not quite so ready with a reply. Do you choose the"
3094,WHAT I MISS.,"young man who has a clean record, who neither drinks nor wastes his"
3095,WHAT I MISS.,money in riotous practices? How about the tobacco chewers and the
3096,WHAT I MISS.,swearers? How about the lewd jesters and the low-minded? Provided he
3097,WHAT I MISS.,"wears fine clothes, can dance well and make a good appearance in"
3098,WHAT I MISS.,"society, and above all can give you a handsome diamond for an engagement"
3099,WHAT I MISS.,"ring, are you not willing to accept a lover in spite of his known"
3100,WHAT I MISS.,"reputation as a fast young man about town? Girls, you had much better"
3101,WHAT I MISS.,choose a specked peach for canning than such a man for a husband. Do you
3102,WHAT I MISS.,"imagine that by and by at the upper court, whither we are all hastening"
3103,WHAT I MISS.,"as quickly as the old patrol wagon of time can carry us, there will be"
3104,WHAT I MISS.,any distinction made between men and women? Think you a man is going to
3105,WHAT I MISS.,get off easier than a sorrowful and sinful woman merely because the
3106,WHAT I MISS.,world falsely taught him that the exigencies of his nature demanded
3107,WHAT I MISS.,greater latitude than hers?

3113,WHAT I MISS.,will wither and die in spite of every effort to restore it to the stem
3114,WHAT I MISS.,from which it fell. And so with the heart from which a low desire in the
3115,WHAT I MISS.,guise of an alluring temptation has snatched the flower of innocence.
3116,WHAT I MISS.,That heart will fade into hopeless loss unless a greater love than yours
3117,WHAT I MISS.,or mine intervenes to save. An impure soul never started out impure from
3118,WHAT I MISS.,the first any more than a peach was decayed in the blossom. It is the
3119,WHAT I MISS.,"small beginnings, dear girls, that lead up to the bitter endings. The"
3120,WHAT I MISS.,"impure book read on the sly, the questionable jest laughed at in secret,"
3121,WHAT I MISS.,the talk indulged in with a schoolmate or a friend which you would be
3122,WHAT I MISS.,"unwilling for ""mother"" to hear, the horrible card circulated under the"

3124,WHAT I MISS.,sadder than the blight of any desolation that storm or drought or frost
3125,WHAT I MISS.,"can bring upon the blossoms. If I only could, how gladly I would dip my"
3126,WHAT I MISS.,pen to-night in a light that should outshine the electric splendor of
3127,WHAT I MISS.,"our streets and write a message against the dark background of the sky,"
3128,WHAT I MISS.,to startle young girls into the realization of the danger that lurks in
3129,WHAT I MISS.,the first indulgence of thoughts and companionships that are not pure.
3130,WHAT I MISS.,"Avoid all such as you would avoid the contagion of small-pox, and a"

3212,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"china and decorate the panels of doors, and on the whole she was"
3213,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"calculated to enjoy life and make it enjoyable for others. But her home,"
3214,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"on the contrary, was utterly devoid of peace and comfort. Her husband"
3215,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"took no pleasure there, although he was lavish in the expenditure of"
3216,THIS BABY OF OURS.,money to render the place attractive. Her children were glad to get away
3217,THIS BABY OF OURS.,from their home and find otherwhere the freedom and gaiety denied them
3218,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"there. Why was all this, when the mother was so eminently fitted by"
3219,THIS BABY OF OURS.,grace and accomplishments to create a beautiful and happy home? Simply
3220,THIS BABY OF OURS.,because she was always fretting and fussing about trifles. She was a
3221,THIS BABY OF OURS.,croaker and always finding fault. She fought flies until life was a
3222,THIS BABY OF OURS.,burden to everybody who watched her. She said that they would spoil the
3223,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"paint, poison the food and ruin the curtains. She was after them at"
3224,THIS BABY OF OURS.,early dawn nor gave over the chase until late at night. She would leave
3225,THIS BABY OF OURS.,the dinner table to chase a fly and kill it with a folded paper. She
3226,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"would stop the lullaby song she was singing to her pretty baby, to get"
3227,THIS BABY OF OURS.,up and call somebody to come in and hunt a stray blue-bottle that was
3228,THIS BABY OF OURS.,bunting its stupid head against the window screen. She said that her
3229,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"life wasn't worth a farthing to her if the flies got into her home, and"
3230,THIS BABY OF OURS.,she would sooner jump in the river than submit to the pestilential
3231,THIS BABY OF OURS.,infliction. Then she was forever prophesying some dreadful fate for
3232,THIS BABY OF OURS.,herself by reason of the muddy footprints that occasionally found their
3233,THIS BABY OF OURS.,way onto the carpets.
3234,THIS BABY OF OURS.,
3235,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"""I declare,"" she would say, ""if you boys don't stop tracking dirt into"
3236,THIS BABY OF OURS.,the house I'll die before my time. If there is anything I hate it is a
3237,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"careless boy!"""
3238,THIS BABY OF OURS.,
3239,THIS BABY OF OURS.,And the boys took her at her word and stopped tracking mud. But they
3240,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"were gradually lured to stay away from home, and the soil they took into"
3241,THIS BABY OF OURS.,their hearts was perhaps harder to efface than the footmarks they left
3242,THIS BABY OF OURS.,upon the floor of mother's neatly kept hallways.
3243,THIS BABY OF OURS.,
3244,THIS BABY OF OURS.,She was always anticipating trouble that never came. She knew the girl
3245,THIS BABY OF OURS.,was going to leave. She was simply too great a treasure to keep. She was
3246,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"absolutely certain that the milkman was watering his milk, and the baby"
3247,THIS BABY OF OURS.,would get sick. She had no doubt whatever but what her husband was
3248,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"going to ruin himself on 'Change, and then what would become of them"
3249,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"all? So she worried and fretted and fumed, until patience, like a hunted"
3250,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"bird, spread its wings and flew away, and what might have been a happy"
3251,THIS BABY OF OURS.,home became a stranded wreck upon the rocks of contention.
3252,THIS BABY OF OURS.,
3253,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"Oh, I tell you right now, girls, if you can only cultivate one"
3254,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"accomplishment out of the many that wait to crown a perfect womanhood,"
3255,THIS BABY OF OURS.,cultivate a pleasant temper and cheerful disposition. The ability to
3256,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"speak many languages, to paint, to dance, to sing, or even to wield a"
3257,THIS BABY OF OURS.,graceful pen is nothing compared to the ability to make a lovely home.
3258,THIS BABY OF OURS.,Nobody ever yet succeeded in that noblest endeavor without abjuring
3259,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"needless faultfinding, croaking and fretting."

3264,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"serve beef--in slices. I believe in teaching truths, rather, as one"
3265,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"whips cream, dropping in the moral as an almost imperceptible flavoring."
3266,THIS BABY OF OURS.,But I tell you there are times when I feel like mounting a pulpit and
3267,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"thundering with old Calvin, until the air emits sulphur. Especially when"
3268,THIS BABY OF OURS.,I see the inhumanities and outrages practiced upon children by witless
3269,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"parents, do I feel stirred to my soul's depths. If we treated our flower"
3270,THIS BABY OF OURS.,beds as we do our children there wouldn't be a blossom left in the
3271,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"world. If we served our meals as we do our children, there would be"
3272,THIS BABY OF OURS.,rampant indigestion and black-browed death at the heels of every one of
3273,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"us. Now and then you see a wise mother and sensible father, but the"
3274,THIS BABY OF OURS.,biggest half of humanity receive their children as youngsters receive
3275,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"their Christmas toys, to be played with when in a good humor, and"
3276,THIS BABY OF OURS.,bundled anywhere out of sight when out of sorts or engrossed with more
3277,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"important matters. We forget, half of us, that a little child's sense of"
3278,THIS BABY OF OURS.,injustice and sorrow and wrong is compatible with its own growth and
3279,THIS BABY OF OURS.,experience rather than with our own. What to us is a paltry trial is the
3280,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"cause of keenest, unalleviated woe to the child of five. The possession"
3281,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of uncounted gold at forty will not be more precious than the possession
3282,THIS BABY OF OURS.,at three of the apple or the book we so rudely snatch from the little
3283,THIS BABY OF OURS.,hands without a word of apology. Take the time to explain to the little
3284,THIS BABY OF OURS.,fellow why you deprive him of some cherished possession and you will
3285,THIS BABY OF OURS.,save the tender bit of a heart a vast amount of unnecessary aching.

3289,THIS BABY OF OURS.,I have many things to be thankful for this stormy winter night. One is
3290,THIS BABY OF OURS.,that the coal bin is full and the lock on the outer door secure. Another
3291,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"is that the rooftree bends above an unbroken band, and that disease with"
3292,THIS BABY OF OURS.,its fell touch lingers the other side of the threshold of the little
3293,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"home. Another is that, as a family, we all have straight backs and"
3294,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"moderately developed intellects; that we are neither dime museum freaks,"
3295,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"lunatics, nor half-wits. Another is that none of us chew gum, carry"
3296,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"around dogs, nor make expectoration the chief business of a day's"
3297,THIS BABY OF OURS.,outing. Another is that I am getting so used to the alarm clock that I
3298,THIS BABY OF OURS.,sleep through its wild clamor and escape the duties that fall to the lot
3299,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of that other member of the home circle whose ear and conscience are not
3300,THIS BABY OF OURS.,so sadly seared as mine. Another is that I know enough to detect butter
3301,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"from oleomargarine, and am not roped in by Blank street vendors with"
3302,THIS BABY OF OURS.,their dollar and a half tubs. Another is that I am not the sort of
3303,THIS BABY OF OURS.,fellow to be always hitting another fellow when he has been down and is
3304,THIS BABY OF OURS.,trying to stand steady again. Another is that I am modest enough to
3305,THIS BABY OF OURS.,question whether I could run a grip any better than he does? Another is
3306,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"that I got one answer to the ""ad."" wherewith I sought to capture a gold"
3307,THIS BABY OF OURS.,watch. It would have been an embarrassing thing to have received not one
3308,THIS BABY OF OURS.,solitary little nibble. Another is that the elevator boy who
3309,THIS BABY OF OURS.,occasionally carries me to the top floor and intermediate stations
3310,THIS BABY OF OURS.,around at Blank's is kind and does not treat me with the haughty scorn
3311,THIS BABY OF OURS.,he bestows on others. Another is that I have the serene equipoise of
3312,THIS BABY OF OURS.,nerve which renders me calm and even cheerful under the knowledge that
3313,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"there is nothing in the house to eat, and two invited guests gently"
3314,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"sleeping the happy hours away in the chamber above, dreaming perchance"
3315,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of toothsome viands not to be. Another is that in spite of weather I
3316,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"take no colds, and am as impervious to catarrhal or pneumonic affections"
3317,THIS BABY OF OURS.,as an eagle is impervious to the attack of tom-tits. Another is that I
3318,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"live in a town where people sell no beer; they may steal and backbite,"
3319,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"and raise the old lad generally, but thank goodness the baleful glitter"
3320,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of a glass beer bottle has never yet eclipsed the moral splendor of the
3321,THIS BABY OF OURS.,scene. Another is that I have been enabled to preserve a few staunch and
3322,THIS BABY OF OURS.,trusty friends through the evolution of that rainy-weather costume which
3323,THIS BABY OF OURS.,a few of my sex have joined me in essaying. I cannot speak for future
3324,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"tests, but so far my henchmen have stood firm. And right here let me say"
3325,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"that any friend, man, woman or babe, who can remain loyal to you after"
3326,THIS BABY OF OURS.,you have been seen in public in a dress-reform garment is worth
3327,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"cultivating, and should be made the theme of special psalms of praise."
3328,THIS BABY OF OURS.,Another is that the picture I had taken the other day looks worse than I
3329,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"do, and when I send it off to unsuspecting admirers I am not torn with"
3330,THIS BABY OF OURS.,the thought that when they see the original they will drop scalding hot
3331,THIS BABY OF OURS.,tears of disappointment. This idea of raising false hopes in the minds
3332,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of confiding strangers savors too much of Ananias and Sapphira. Another
3333,THIS BABY OF OURS.,is that so far in life I have preserved a stern and unshaken resolution
3334,THIS BABY OF OURS.,not to wear a false front. A woman in a store bang is next worse to a
3335,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"chromo in an art gallery, or a muslin rose among American beauties"
3336,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"fresh from the rose gardens. Artificiality, my dear, pretense and"
3337,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"assumption, are harder to put up with than anything else in the world,"
3338,THIS BABY OF OURS.,unless it is corns. But far ahead of all the above enumerated causes for
3339,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"gratitude is one which thrills me most profoundly, and which can be"
3340,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"summed up in half a dozen words, the echo of which, perhaps, will find a"
3341,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"lodgment in some other hearts. I am thankful, very, very thankful, that"
3342,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"I am not the mother, nor the aunt, nor the half-sister, nor the first"
3343,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"cousin, nor even the next-door neighbor, of the boy who kills sparrows"
3344,THIS BABY OF OURS.,for two cents bounty on the little heads. If I had such a boy within
3345,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"range of my voice to-night I should say to him, ""Be poor, my man; be"
3346,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"unsuccessful in business, and not up to bargains all your life, but"
3347,THIS BABY OF OURS.,don't be shrewd and sordid and cruel in seeking your gains. Better go by
3348,THIS BABY OF OURS.,the name of 'mollycoddle' and 'baby' among the other boys than get to be
3349,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"a little ruffian with your arrow and your sling-shot, and the name of a"
3350,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"keen-killer tacked on to yourself. Let the sparrows alone, or if you"
3351,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"really feel that they are the nuisance they are made out to be, kill"
3352,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"them if you like, but do it in a gentlemanly way (if such a paradox is"
3353,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"possible), and don't take money for the job."" The boy or the man who"
3354,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"will take a life for sordid ends, or, in other words, who will seek to"
3355,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"enrich himself on ""blood money,"" is pretty low down in the human scale."

3360,THIS BABY OF OURS.,should be well cleared of deleterious substance before use. Ill-will and
3361,THIS BABY OF OURS.,malice and the desire to wound are worse than chicory. Between a laugh
3362,THIS BABY OF OURS.,and a giggle there is the width of the horizons. I could sit all day and
3363,THIS BABY OF OURS.,listen to the hearty and heartsome ha! ha! of a lot of bright and jolly
3364,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"people, but would rather be shot by a Winchester rifle at short range"
3365,THIS BABY OF OURS.,than be forced to stay within earshot of a couple of silly gossips.
3366,THIS BABY OF OURS.,Cultivate that part of your nature that is quick to see the mirthful
3367,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"side of things, so shall you be enabled to shed many of life's troubles,"
3368,THIS BABY OF OURS.,as the plumage of the bird sheds rain. But discourage all tendencies to
3369,THIS BABY OF OURS.,seek your amusement at the expense of another's feelings or in aught
3370,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"that is impure. It was Goethe who said: ""Tell me what a man laughs at"

3375,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"I'll take my chances any day to find heaven on earth, if I can have the"
3376,THIS BABY OF OURS.,run of the woods up along our northern lake shore in early springtime. I
3377,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"want no companions either, unless, perhaps, it be a child or a dog, for"
3378,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"artificial women and dudish men, let loose in the woods, are harder to"
3379,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"endure than gad-flies. It was scarcely more than sunrise, the other"
3380,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"morning, when I left the house and took my way toward the forest shrine"
3381,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"undesecrated as yet by surveyors or wood-choppers, the advent of either"
3382,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of whom in a country town means good-bye to heaven on that particular
3383,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"spot of earth! We found the air so full of sweetness, the instant we"
3384,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"struck the depths of the woods, that one could almost fancy the wise men"
3385,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of the East had been there before us to greet the new-born Spring with
3386,THIS BABY OF OURS.,spices as they greeted another Heaven-born child a score of centuries
3387,THIS BABY OF OURS.,ago in Bethlehem. Every shrub held a softly-tinted leafbud half
3388,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"unfolded, like a listless hand. The maple leaves were pink and glossy,"
3389,THIS BABY OF OURS.,like rose petals wet with rain. The hickory trees were unfolding great
3390,THIS BABY OF OURS.,creamy buds that looked like magnolias. The hawthorns were all afloat
3391,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"with silver blossoms, like loosened sails. The earth seemed singing to"
3392,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"the heavens, ""God is here!"" and from the blue depths of quietude, where"
3393,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"a few clouds spread their soft wings like brooding birds, came back the"
3394,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"answer, ""He is here!"" The lake claimed Him, and a thousand azure waves"
3395,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"murmured His presence on the deep. Wherever we looked, at our feet where"
3396,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"the June lilies whitened the ground like perfumed snow, and the moss was"
3397,THIS BABY OF OURS.,bubbling like a wayside spring with sunshine in place of water; at the
3398,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"misty foliage overhead, like shadowy spirit wings; at the circle of blue"
3399,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"that bounded the earth, or into the very heart of heaven above us, it"
3400,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"seemed as though God, visible and manifest, was there to give us"
3401,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"greeting. Finally, we found a point of high land, touched here and there"
3402,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"with shadows flung down from budding birches, and starred with"
3403,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"dandelions in flocks, like golden butterflies. Here, leaving the"
3404,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"material part of me leaning up against a tree-trunk to rest, as one"
3405,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"thrusts a cumbersome garment on a nail, my soul went wandering off into"

3497,THIS BABY OF OURS.,civilization and the marts of trade. I want to gather together a picked
3498,THIS BABY OF OURS.,band of kindred souls and go out and pitch tent by the Gunnison River.
3499,THIS BABY OF OURS.,Ever been there? Imagine a stream of gold flowing through hills colored
3500,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"like an apple orchard in May, with a sky bending down above them like"
3501,THIS BABY OF OURS.,the wing of an oriole. I want to forget the insolence of a class who may
3502,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"be as good as I am in the eye of the law, but whom it would take a ton"
3503,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of soap and God's grace to make my equal in point of cleanliness and
3504,THIS BABY OF OURS.,decency. I want to forget forever the clang of the cable car and the
3505,THIS BABY OF OURS.,rumble of its wheels. I want to return to the heathendom that worships
3506,THIS BABY OF OURS.,gods instead of dollars and loves mankind simply because it knows
3507,THIS BABY OF OURS.,nothing of faithlessness and fraud.

3511,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"""Plaze, sor,"" said a servant to the head of a certain suburban household"
3512,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"the other morning, ""the gintleman who sthole the chickens left his hat"
3513,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"in the hincoop."" Just so, Bridget. And the lady who attends to the"
3514,THIS BABY OF OURS.,affairs of the kitchen has her foot upon the neck of the miserable woman
3515,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"who is nominally at the head of the house. Oh, no! I am not going to"
3516,THIS BABY OF OURS.,enter into a disquisition upon the merits of the servant question. Years
3517,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"ago, when I cantered lightly in my ride against windmills, I might have"
3518,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"undertaken it, but the question has grown too large to be settled by"
3519,THIS BABY OF OURS.,talking. The state of things in this free country is growing just a
3520,THIS BABY OF OURS.,trifle too free. There are no longer any servants in this proud land. It
3521,THIS BABY OF OURS.,is not ladylike to serve. The person who superintends the domestic
3522,THIS BABY OF OURS.,affairs of our home merely condescends for a consideration. We no
3523,THIS BABY OF OURS.,longer have any rights as employers. The wind has tacked to another
3524,THIS BABY OF OURS.,quarter. Should we wish to discharge our lady cook or dispense with the
3525,THIS BABY OF OURS.,services of a gentleman artisan it stands in place for us to approach
3526,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"them in a respectful manner, put the case before them clearly and ask"
3527,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"them humbly, without offense to their delicate sensibilities, if they"
3528,THIS BABY OF OURS.,will kindly allow us to forego their so-called services. Question
3529,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"yourself seriously, my dear; are you sufficiently considerate? Think how"
3530,THIS BABY OF OURS.,these defenseless ladies and thin-skinned gentlemen who fill positions
3531,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of trust in your establishment must suffer sometimes from your boorish
3532,THIS BABY OF OURS.,impetuosity. Are you always cordial in your greeting when the worn face
3533,THIS BABY OF OURS.,of the cook appears at the delayed breakfast hour and she places before
3534,THIS BABY OF OURS.,you the hurried pancake and the underdone steak? Do you stop to think
3535,THIS BABY OF OURS.,how the poor creature has danced all night at a ball and has crept home
3536,THIS BABY OF OURS.,after your stiff-necked and rebellious husband has bounded away to catch
3537,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"the early train, breakfastless and profane? And when the low-voiced and"
3538,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"timid second girl tells you that, as a lady who knows her place, she"
3539,THIS BABY OF OURS.,really cannot demean herself to wipe off the paint or sweep the front
3540,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"steps, do you take her by the hand and acknowledge the indiscretion of"
3541,THIS BABY OF OURS.,your coarser nature in expecting her to do such menial service? How many
3542,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"of us, clods that we are, have raged when the mild-mannered laundry maid"
3543,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"has appropriated our underclothing, or remonstrated when the number"
3544,THIS BABY OF OURS.,seven foot of the blue-blooded cook has condescended to stretch our
3545,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"silken hose? It behooves us to join the ranks of the ""philanthropic"
3546,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"fiends"" and look to it that we improve our methods of treating the"
3547,THIS BABY OF OURS.,delicate gentry who tarry with us so briefly.

3552,THIS BABY OF OURS.,effect that the girls are responsible for all the tomfoolery in the
3553,THIS BABY OF OURS.,world. Don't you know that you are the very ones who tend to make them
3554,THIS BABY OF OURS.,so--you men? You follow after and woo and wed just that sort of girls.
3555,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"You won't look at a sensible little woman who can make ""lovely"" bread,"
3556,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"abjures bangs, can't dance and has no ""style."" You laugh at and make sly"
3557,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"jokes at the expense of our big hats and our pronounced fashions, but"
3558,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"when you choose your company, and often your wives, I notice you pass"
3559,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"right by the home-keeping birds and take the peacocks. Of course, no one"
3560,THIS BABY OF OURS.,lives in this age who doubts for a moment that woman's chief aim in life
3561,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"and purpose of creation, as well as her hope of a blessed hereafter, is"
3562,THIS BABY OF OURS.,to please the men and get a husband. If you won't have her modest and
3563,THIS BABY OF OURS.,simply gowned she is willing to make a feather-headed doll and a
3564,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"travesty of herself to get you and win heaven! You know perfectly well,"
3565,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"you men, that you don't care half so much for brains as you do for"
3566,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"general ""get-up,"" and the woman you honor with your choice is selected"
3567,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"for a pretty face and form, and a becoming costume rather than for a"
3568,THIS BABY OF OURS.,clever head and an honest heart. I am not talking to old fogies who
3569,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"cling to old-fashioned notions, but to young men who ridicule the"
3570,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"customs of their grandmothers, who shake their heads at salaries of two"
3571,THIS BABY OF OURS.,and three thousand a year as inadequate to support wives; who rail
3572,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"against woman's extravagance, yet do their best to maintain her in it."
3573,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"When you, my fine and dapper gentleman, begin to seek out the modestly"
3574,THIS BABY OF OURS.,"appareled and the sedate girls, then shall folly and vain show fly over"
3575,THIS BABY OF OURS.,seas for want of encouragement and the grand transformation of sawdust
3576,THIS BABY OF OURS.,dolls into women and pleasure-seekers into home-keepers take place.

3602,TWO DAYS.,There are some people who live in this world as a cucumber grows in a
3603,TWO DAYS.,garden. They cling to their own vine and serve no higher end than
3604,TWO DAYS.,rotundity and relish. There are others who live in the world as a summer
3605,TWO DAYS.,breeze lives in a meadow; they find out all the hidden flowers and set
3606,TWO DAYS.,the perfumes flying. There are others who live as the sea lives in a
3607,TWO DAYS.,shell; their existence is nothing but a sigh. There are others who live
3608,TWO DAYS.,as the fire lives in a diamond; they are all sparkle. And there are
3609,TWO DAYS.,"others, and they outnumber all the rest, who live as a blind mole lives"
3610,TWO DAYS.,"in the soil; they see nothing, feel nothing, suffer and enjoy a little"
3611,TWO DAYS.,"now and then, perhaps, but know nothing to all eternity. Such people"
3612,TWO DAYS.,"walk through life as the mole walks through the glory of a summer day,"
3613,TWO DAYS.,or burrows beneath the dazzle of a winter storm. They are as
3614,TWO DAYS.,irresponsive to the voices all about them as the mole is to the singing
3615,TWO DAYS.,of April robins. They are as untouched by the myriad influences of life
3616,TWO DAYS.,as the mole is by the light of a star or the flash of a comet. Their
3617,TWO DAYS.,"only interest is in the question, ""Wherewith shall we be clothed, and"
3618,TWO DAYS.,"what shall we have to eat?"" They gather the ripened hours from the tree"
3619,TWO DAYS.,"of life as a child gathers fruit, merely for the gratification of an"
3620,TWO DAYS.,"instant appetite, not as the careful housewife does, who garners in a"
3621,TWO DAYS.,store for wintry weather. Life to them is merely a fattening process.
3622,TWO DAYS.,They remind one of prize beef at a county fair; to-morrow brings the
3623,TWO DAYS.,"shambles and the butcher's axe, but in the serene content of a"
3624,TWO DAYS.,"well-filled stall and a full stomach, they take no thought of the"
3625,TWO DAYS.,future. We meet such people every day and everywhere. On the streets
3626,TWO DAYS.,"they may see a brute tyrannizing over a helpless beast of burden, or a"
3627,TWO DAYS.,"mother (?) yanking a sobbing child along by the arm, as full of ugliness"
3628,TWO DAYS.,"herself as a thunder-cloud is of electricity, or a man following an"
3629,TWO DAYS.,"innocent young girl with the devil in his heart, or a big boy"
3630,TWO DAYS.,tyrannizing over a smaller one; and they pass it all by as indifferently
3631,TWO DAYS.,as the mole would sneak across a battlefield the morning after a battle.
3632,TWO DAYS.,They have too much to do themselves to waste time in remedying other
3633,TWO DAYS.,people's grievances. They think too much of personal reputation to
3634,TWO DAYS.,"involve themselves in an altercation with defilers of the innocent, and"
3635,TWO DAYS.,tramplers of the weak. They are too respectable to get mixed up in
3636,TWO DAYS.,"brawls, even if the disturbance is brought about by the devil's own"
3637,TWO DAYS.,drummers looking up recruits among the championless and defenseless
3638,TWO DAYS.,"working-girls, or the parentless and homeless children of a great city."
3639,TWO DAYS.,We meet them traveling through the mountains or loitering by the sea.
3640,TWO DAYS.,Their only use for mountains is that they may carve their precious
3641,TWO DAYS.,"initials on the highest peaks, pick winter-greens and blue-berries and"
3642,TWO DAYS.,display their fashionable suits and striped stockings. They look upon
3643,TWO DAYS.,"the sea as a big bathing-tank, and the sky, with all its splendor of"
3644,TWO DAYS.,"cloud and its glory of sunrise and sunset, as a barometer to forecast"
3645,TWO DAYS.,"the weather. We meet them in business relations, and they never believe"
3646,TWO DAYS.,that courtesy and business can go together. A merchant in his office or
3647,TWO DAYS.,"a lady in her parlor will bluntly refuse to buy of a worn-out,"
3648,TWO DAYS.,"discouraged, heart-sick book-agent, ignoring the fact that a smile"
3649,TWO DAYS.,"accompanying even a refusal acts like a spoonful of sugar in bitter tea,"
3650,TWO DAYS.,"and costs less. Even a ""lady"" clerk, behind a counter, will be haughty"
3651,TWO DAYS.,"and unaccommodating and insolent to the woman who comes to buy,"
3652,TWO DAYS.,forgetful that a customer will go a long distance out of her way to deal
3653,TWO DAYS.,"with a polite and well-mannered clerk, and that, like honesty,"
3654,TWO DAYS.,"politeness is ever the best policy. And, on the other hand, a woman"
3655,TWO DAYS.,"shopper will be whimsical and captious and trying, forgetting that the"
3656,TWO DAYS.,"girl who serves her has human blood in her veins, and often carries a"
3657,TWO DAYS.,troubled heart behind her smile or her frown.

3681,TWO DAYS.,"them and let you strike the balance at the close, to see which way the"
3682,TWO DAYS.,"world is jogging. I saw a father, drunk, beside his little blue-eyed"
3683,TWO DAYS.,"daughter. His head was laid in maudlin sleep upon her shoulder, and with"
3684,TWO DAYS.,blushes that came and went across her face like cloud shadows on the
3685,TWO DAYS.,"slope of a hill, she sat and bore the burden of her childish shame like"
3686,TWO DAYS.,"a little angel. I saw a hard-faced, labor-grimed man step out of his way"
3687,TWO DAYS.,to pick a wild rose that grew by the side of the road. I saw a young man
3688,TWO DAYS.,lash his horse because his own bungling driving came near colliding his
3689,TWO DAYS.,vehicle with a cable car. I saw a policeman spring to the rescue of an
3690,TWO DAYS.,"old beggar woman who stumbled on a street crossing, and saw him fall and"
3691,TWO DAYS.,trampled upon in the discharge of duty. I saw a pretty girl reach out
3692,TWO DAYS.,her white fingers and feed a discouraged street-car horse the banana she
3693,TWO DAYS.,was eating as she passed by. I saw a beaten dog turn and fawn beneath
3694,TWO DAYS.,"his master's brutal kick, and I thought to myself, where is a more"
3695,TWO DAYS.,faithful friendship than that? I saw a little golden-headed boy at the
3696,TWO DAYS.,"window of a house as I rode by, and when I waved my hand he kissed his"
3697,TWO DAYS.,in return. I saw a tired mother stoop to hug the child who fidgeted at
3698,TWO DAYS.,"her knee in the tedious depot waiting-room, and I saw another slap her"
3699,TWO DAYS.,baby because its sticky fingers sought to fondle her cheek. I saw a
3700,TWO DAYS.,"little girl get up, without suggestion from her mother, and yield her"
3701,TWO DAYS.,seat to an older person. I saw a lamed and dying bird just brought down
3702,TWO DAYS.,by a boy's sling-shot. (I saw that same boy in Sabbath-school last
3703,TWO DAYS.,Sunday!) I saw one woman in fifty thousand wearing the dress-reform. I
3704,TWO DAYS.,saw eleven girls out of nineteen with tightly-laced waists! I saw a hurt
3705,TWO DAYS.,"kitten tenderly attended to by a soldier in blue, as I passed Fort"
3706,TWO DAYS.,"Sheridan Camp, and involuntarily I said to myself: ""The bravest are the"
3707,TWO DAYS.,"tenderest; the loving are the daring."" I saw a small boy beating his"

3709,TWO DAYS.,"dangerous way, and so, I thought, we treat the tender God who sometimes"
3710,TWO DAYS.,"lifts us, against our will, from evil ways. I saw a little coffin in an"

3821,TWO DAYS.,"facial contortions, and that the time has come for the extinction of her"
3822,TWO DAYS.,type from the face of the blooming earth. I want the power to consign
3823,TWO DAYS.,"every man who even mentions ""nose bag"" to a horse, to the guillotine,"
3824,TWO DAYS.,and to imprison for life every brute who carries a snake-whip or uses a
3825,TWO DAYS.,check-rein. I want to solder the man or woman who objects to fresh air

3841,TWO DAYS.,people to disturb. I want to grow to be more like an eagle that wings
3842,TWO DAYS.,"its way out of the habitat of gadflies, and less like a trembling hare"
3843,TWO DAYS.,pursued by hounds. I want to take the lesson to my heart that the soul
3844,TWO DAYS.,that is constant to itself and aspires towards heaven shall never be
3845,TWO DAYS.,left a prey to care and unrest. I want to strike a dress reform which
3846,TWO DAYS.,"shall make women look less like guys, and to encounter a rainy day in"
3847,TWO DAYS.,"which I shall not bite the dust, I and my umbrella, and my"

3896,TWO DAYS.,altogether too jolly and bright a spot to link with thoughts of sorrow
3897,TWO DAYS.,"and pain and death. We drove over to the soldiers' home, where from four"
3898,TWO DAYS.,to five thousand veteran warriors have found shelter from the bombarding

3900,TWO DAYS.,"and still golden with April sap, in sunny corners of broad piazzas, on"
3901,TWO DAYS.,"benches by the slope of sluggish streams, or walking about the well-kept"

3909,TWO DAYS.,scarcely more eventless than their death shall finally be. Some way the

4001,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"could not dance a step, save in front of a northeast gale, or in a game"

4021,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,although drifting far from her childhood's faith in many ways still

4180,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"Once when I was a child, with two long yellow braids down my back, and a"
4181,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"very great capacity for happiness in my heart, I lived in a remote"
4182,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,country with an aunt who didn't believe in any one having too good a
4183,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,time here on earth. She thought they would appreciate the new Jerusalem
4184,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"all the more, perhaps, for having a dismal experience here (there are"
4185,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"lots like her, too, in the world to-day). Well, once afterward when I"
4186,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"came home from school (and, ah! as I write how I can see the old road"
4187,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"where I walked, winding its way under silver birches by the side of a"
4188,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"trout-brook), somebody came out of the house and beckoned wildly, madly"
4189,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"for me to hurry up. It was my little cousin, and she looked as though"
4190,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,she had just skipped out of heaven! Her cheeks were all aglow and her
4191,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"eyes were shining like stars. ""Oh, come! Come quick!"" she shouted."
4192,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"""There's something in the parlor."" I made haste to enter, and there"
4193,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"before me sat a doll, the biggest and most splendid it had ever entered"
4194,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"my young heart to imagine. It was dressed in pink tarletan, and had a"
4195,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,pair of jeweled earrings in its exceedingly life-like ears. At once I
4196,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,became embarrassed. Self-consciousness sprang into full being. I was
4197,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,painfully aware that my own dress and general appearance suffered by
4198,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,contrast with the doll. Nor have I ever since experienced a keener
4199,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,sensation of embarrassment than overcame me as I faced that gaudy image
4200,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"in wax. My aunt's sarcastic remark, ""No wonder that child's mother can't"
4201,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,lay up a cent for a rainy day when she throws away her dollars on a doll
4202,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"like that!"" gave me the sad impression that my darling mother was a"
4203,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"spendthrift, something after the pattern of the prodigal son. From the"
4204,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,first moment the doll was a source of disappointment and sorrow to me. I
4205,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,never could play with it with any comfort because I was afraid of
4206,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"soiling its splendid clothes, losing its earrings, or feeling myself and"
4207,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,my calico and homespun abashed by its superior attire. That doll did me
4208,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"no good, and just what it did for me its costly and extravagantly"
4209,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,dressed sisterhood is doing for hundreds of little girls to-day. Too
4210,THE STORY OF A ROSE.,"fine to be played with, rigged out in all its paraphernalia of empty"

4275,LINES TO MY LOVE.,nothing but a big bunch of tulips standing within a crystal vase in the
4276,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"sun. The maples glistened like gold, and were flecked with ruby drops"
4277,LINES TO MY LOVE.,that burned and glowed like spilled wine. The oaks were russet brown and
4278,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"dusky purple, cleft here and there with vivid green, like glimpses of a"
4279,LINES TO MY LOVE.,windy sea through shadowed hills. The leaves that had fallen to the

4281,LINES TO MY LOVE.,that made the air as sweet as any bakeshop. The odor of fallen leaves

4289,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"before the road struck landward through the woods, I could but extend my"
4290,LINES TO MY LOVE.,arm to the glorious expanse of waters and bless the Lord with all my
4291,LINES TO MY LOVE.,soul for so lovely a place to tarry in between times. If this world is

4297,LINES TO MY LOVE.,After leaving Ravinia I proceeded to get lost in the woods. A very
4298,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"small boy and a very large dog were standing by a fence. ""Does that dog"
4299,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"bite?"" I asked. ""Yes'm,"" promptly replied the sweet and candid child. So"
4300,LINES TO MY LOVE.,I climbed a fence and struck for the timber. I soon found that all
4301,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"knowledge of the points of the compass had failed me. ""If I am going"
4302,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"east,"" I mused, ""I shall soon strike the lake; if west, the track; south"
4303,LINES TO MY LOVE.,will eventually bring me to the Chicago River; but a northerly direction
4304,LINES TO MY LOVE.,will restore me to the sleuth-hound. I will say my prayers and endeavor
4305,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"to keep to the south."" The way grew denser. My hat gave me some trouble,"
4306,LINES TO MY LOVE.,as it insisted upon hanging itself to every tree in the wilderness. The
4307,LINES TO MY LOVE.,twigs twitched the hair-pins from my hair and poked themselves into my
4308,LINES TO MY LOVE.,eyes. A few corpulent bugs toyed with my ankles and a large caterpillar
4309,LINES TO MY LOVE.,passed the blockade of my collar-button and basked in the warmth of my
4310,LINES TO MY LOVE.,neck. I nearly stepped on a snake and was confronted by a toad that
4311,LINES TO MY LOVE.,froze me with a glance of its basilisk eye. So I changed my course and
4312,LINES TO MY LOVE.,suddenly entered a little woodland graveyard--a handful of neglected
4313,LINES TO MY LOVE.,mounds of earth and silence. No tombstones marked the graves. A
4314,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"rudely-constructed cross of wood, gray with lichens, alone told of"
4315,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"consecrated ground. There, away off from the road in the silence of the"
4316,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"woods, a few tired hearts were taking their rest. Silently I stood a"
4317,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"moment, then stole away and left the place to its hush of lonely peace."
4318,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"What right had I, with my frets and feathers, my twig-punctured"
4319,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"eye-balls and my toad-perturbed nerves, to bring an unquiet presence"
4320,LINES TO MY LOVE.,within this abode of silence and of rest? I sat down on a fence-rail a
4321,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"moment while, like Miss Riderhood, I deftly twisted up my back hair and"
4322,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"mused briefly. When the time comes, oh, intensely alive and happy Amber,"
4323,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"for your feet to halt in the march, ask to be buried in the woods, where"
4324,LINES TO MY LOVE.,your grave will be forgotten and the constant years with falling leaves

4334,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"""Glints."" After leaving the little graveyard I allowed my instincts to"
4335,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"carry me in a new direction, and soon a rustling among the dead leaves,"
4336,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"and the sound of hushed breathing, convinced me that I was approaching a"
4337,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"living presence. I felt for my revolver. It was there, but unloaded. (I"
4338,LINES TO MY LOVE.,would sooner walk arm in arm with death than carry loaded firearms.) I
4339,LINES TO MY LOVE.,advanced bravely and became speedily aware of a score or so of large and
4340,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"startled eyes, all fixed upon me. A half-score of woolly heads were"
4341,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"lifted, and a flock of sheep stood ready to take instant flight if I"
4342,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"showed sign of battle. ""My dear young friends,"" said I, ""it is a relief"
4343,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"to meet you, and I give you good morrow. I fully expected to encounter a"
4344,LINES TO MY LOVE.,band of cutthroat tramps who should toss pennies for my heart's blood.
4345,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"The blessings of a rescued woman rest upon your crinkly coats, my"
4346,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"beauties."" A half-hour's walk through the woods brought me to a clearing"
4347,LINES TO MY LOVE.,where a flock of bluebirds were holding council together among the
4348,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"falling leaves. They seemed inclined to start southward, but tarried for"
4349,LINES TO MY LOVE.,one last frolic. How beautiful they were as they flitted in and out
4350,LINES TO MY LOVE.,among the golden underbrush no eye but mine shall ever know. Bluebirds
4351,LINES TO MY LOVE.,have always been associated with thoughts of spring and apple-blossoms
4352,LINES TO MY LOVE.,heretofore. I could hardly believe my senses to find them here amid the
4353,LINES TO MY LOVE.,late and falling leaves. For a while I loitered in their midst and
4354,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"wished for a fairy to change me into one of their winged company, that I"
4355,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"might forget care and find no need of revolvers; but time, as sternly"
4356,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"announced by my exquisite Waterbury, admitted of no delay, so I hied me"
4357,LINES TO MY LOVE.,onward. At this point in my walk I approached a broken gate and a
4358,LINES TO MY LOVE.,stretch of shockingly muddy road. The vanity of confidence in any
4359,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"strength that emanates alone from the ""heels of a man"" was by this time"
4360,LINES TO MY LOVE.,beginning to make itself felt. I longed to sit down in the miry way and
4361,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"go to sleep. A child could have played with me despite my revolver, and"
4362,LINES TO MY LOVE.,a day-old lamb have gained the victory in a personal encounter. At this
4363,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"moment, while I lingered, picking my way daintily from tuft to tuft of"
4364,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"the swamp, I was confronted by a tall, gaunt woman. Of course you don't"
4365,LINES TO MY LOVE.,believe this; it reads too much like a dime novel. You think I am
4366,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"painting my picture in lurid tints for public exhibition, but in spite"
4367,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"of your incredulity I repeat that I was confronted by a tall, gaunt"
4368,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"woman, who appeared as suddenly as though invoked by an evil spell from"
4369,LINES TO MY LOVE.,the mud. The woman was shabbily dressed and wore an old-fashioned scoop
4370,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"bonnet. She had a bundle on her arm, and was dragging by the hair of the"
4371,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"head, as it were, an indescribable umbrella. My voice sank out of sight,"
4372,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"like a stone in the sea, and my feet grew too heavy to lift. I stared in"
4373,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"silence. ""Is your name Maria Hopkins?"" asked the woman."
4374,LINES TO MY LOVE.,
4375,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"""Indeed it is,"" I replied, prepared to get down on my knees and swear to"
4376,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"the truth of what I said, if need be. ""I thought so,"" said my companion;"
4377,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"""let us pray."" But I didn't stop for prayers. Convinced that my time had"
4378,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"come, and that I was in the presence of a lunatic, I fell over the fence"
4379,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"and ran. When I was out of breath I looked over my shoulder, but the"
4380,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"woman was nowhere in sight. To pursue my walk seemed unnecessary,"
4381,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"especially as I was nearing the house of a friend, so summoning what"
4382,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"strength was left me I toddled onward, completing my tenth mile in five"
4383,LINES TO MY LOVE.,hours from the starting. After my sympathizing friend had emptied her
4384,LINES TO MY LOVE.,camphor bottle upon me I asked her if she knew a party of the name of
4385,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"Hopkins anywhere in town, and if there was any resemblance between such"
4386,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"a person and myself. I saw she thought I was delirious, and no"
4387,LINES TO MY LOVE.,explanation has ever dispelled that belief. Some day I shall complete
4388,LINES TO MY LOVE.,the walk and write up the finish.

4399,LINES TO MY LOVE.,between them as there is between griddle cakes made with yeast and
4400,LINES TO MY LOVE.,griddle cakes in which the careless cook forgot to put the leaven. Shall
4401,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"I tell you the kind of girl I especially adore? Well, first of all, let"
4402,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"us take the working girl. She is not a ""lady"" in the acceptance of the"
4403,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"term by this latter day's hybrid democracy. She is just a blithe,"
4404,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"cheery, sweet-tempered young woman. She may have a father rich enough to"
4405,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"support her at home, but for all that she is a working girl. She is"
4406,LINES TO MY LOVE.,never idle. She is studying or sewing or helping about the home part of
4407,LINES TO MY LOVE.,the day. She is romping or playing or swinging out of doors the other
4408,LINES TO MY LOVE.,part. She is never frowsy nor untidy nor lazy. She is never rude nor
4409,LINES TO MY LOVE.,slangy nor bold. And yet she is always full of fun and ready for frolic.
4410,LINES TO MY LOVE.,She does not depend upon a servant to do what she can do for herself.
4411,LINES TO MY LOVE.,She is considerate to all who serve her. She is reverent to the old and
4412,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"thoughtful of the feeble. She never criticises when criticism can wound,"
4413,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"and she is ready with a helpful, loving word for every one. Sometimes"
4414,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"she has no father, or her parents are too poor to support her. Then she"
4415,LINES TO MY LOVE.,goes out and earns her living by whatever her hands find to do. She
4416,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"clerks in a store, or she counts out change at a cashier's desk, or she"
4417,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"teaches school, or she clicks a typewriter, or rather a telegrapher's"
4418,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"key, but always and everywhere she is modest and willing and sweet,"
4419,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"provided she doesn't get that meddlesome little ""bee"" of ""lady""-hood in"
4420,LINES TO MY LOVE.,her bonnet. If she tries to be a lady at the expense of all that is
4421,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"honest and frank in her nature, she is like a black baby crying for a"
4422,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"black kitten in the dark--you can't tell what she is exactly, but you"
4423,LINES TO MY LOVE.,know she is mighty disagreeable. She has too much dignity to be imposed
4424,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"upon, or put to open affront, but she has humility also, and purity that"
4425,LINES TO MY LOVE.,differs from prudishness as a dove in the air differs from a stuffed
4426,LINES TO MY LOVE.,bird in a showcase. She is quick to apologize when she knows she is in
4427,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"the wrong, yet no young queen ever carried a higher head than she can"
4428,LINES TO MY LOVE.,upon justifiable occasions. She is not always imagining herself looked
4429,LINES TO MY LOVE.,down upon because she is poor. She knows full well that out of her own
4430,LINES TO MY LOVE.,heart and mouth proceed the only witnesses that can absolve or condemn
4431,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"her. If she eats peanuts in public places, and talks loud, and flirts"
4432,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"with strange boys, and chews gum or displays a toothpick she is common,"
4433,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"even though she wore a four-foot placard emblazoned with the misnomer,"
4434,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"""lady."" If she is quick to be courteous, unselfish, gentle and retiring"
4435,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"in speech and manner in public places, she is true gold, even though her"
4436,LINES TO MY LOVE.,dress be faded and her bonnet be old. You cannot mistake any girl any
4437,LINES TO MY LOVE.,more than you can mistake the sunshine that follows the rain or the
4438,LINES TO MY LOVE.,lark that springs from the hawthorn hedge. All things that are blooming
4439,LINES TO MY LOVE.,and sweet attend her! The earth is better for her passing through it and
4440,LINES TO MY LOVE.,heaven will be fairer for her habitation therein. God bless her!

4462,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"Dominated by that superfluous energy which has, so far, rendered my"
4463,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"earthly career cyclonic, I called together a confiding band during the"
4464,LINES TO MY LOVE.,height of the recent snow carnival for the purpose of a sleigh ride. The
4465,LINES TO MY LOVE.,opening up of that sleigh ride was propitious. The caravan moved due
4466,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"north, bound for a destination that shall be nameless. We tried to look"
4467,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"upon the attention we attracted as a public ovation, but it was far more"
4468,LINES TO MY LOVE.,suggestive of the way they used to accompany outlaws beyond the limits
4469,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"of a mining town, or of the children of Israel chased by Pharaoh's"
4470,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"mocking hosts. It was cold. Our noses, in the light of a wan old moon,"
4471,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"looked like doorknobs. Our ears cracked to the lightest touch, like harp"
4472,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"strings in the wind. Patient, long-suffering ""doctor!"" Shall I ever"
4473,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"forget how, turning to him when the carnival of sport was at its height,"
4474,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"I murmured: ""Are you enjoying yourself, dear?"" And he replied, with"
4475,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"ghastly sarcasm: ""Tumultuously, my love!"" So might an arctic frigate,"
4476,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"ice-bound, have hailed a polar bear. Suddenly, when all seemed"
4477,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"progressing serenely, we came to a standstill, something like what might"
4478,LINES TO MY LOVE.,be expected from a runaway horse checked by the newly patented electric
4479,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"button. What was the matter? Bare ground. Now, under ordinary"
4480,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"circumstances, the term ""bare ground"" is not synonymous of disaster. But"
4481,LINES TO MY LOVE.,if ever in the dispensation of providence it falls to your lot to be one
4482,LINES TO MY LOVE.,of a band of sleigh-riding imbeciles then shall those two words be to
4483,LINES TO MY LOVE.,you what snags in the channel are to seaward-hastening keels. The driver
4484,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"shouted and became distinctly profane. ""Would you please get out and"
4485,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"walk over this bad place?"" said he. With such speed as our petrified"
4486,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"members would allow we all got out, and the women sat on a wayside"
4487,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"fence, while the men ""heaved to"" and dragged the chariot over about a"
4488,LINES TO MY LOVE.,mile and a quarter of bare ground.
4489,LINES TO MY LOVE.,
4490,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"""Shall we make for the nearest line of street cars?"" asked one of the"

4505,LINES TO MY LOVE.,have it write a word that could be construed into defense or
4506,LINES TO MY LOVE.,encouragement of loud and blatant women. The over-dressed and slangy
4507,LINES TO MY LOVE.,sisterhood who parade in public places and storm the land these latter
4508,LINES TO MY LOVE.,days will meet with nothing from Amber and her pen but wholesale
4509,LINES TO MY LOVE.,denunciation while the lamp of an insignificant life holds out to burn.
4510,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"I hate them as a Quaker hates gunpowder, and I am more than half"
4511,LINES TO MY LOVE.,inclined to believe that the total extermination of the stock would be
4512,LINES TO MY LOVE.,one of the supremest blessings that could be vouchsafed to man. The
4513,LINES TO MY LOVE.,tendencies toward boldness and effrontery which characterize the present
4514,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"day, the unabashed speech and action and the manifest lack of"
4515,LINES TO MY LOVE.,old-fashioned courtesy and the reserve that springs from gentle breeding
4516,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"are evils that grow rather than diminish. A gentlewoman, a pure, correct"
4517,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"and lovely gentlewoman, occupies a loftier place than any throne, and"
4518,LINES TO MY LOVE.,wields an influence more potent than the swing of a jeweled scepter. Yet
4519,LINES TO MY LOVE.,it is never by vulgar assumption that she enters into her kingdom. The
4520,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"parrot is not a bird we prize, although its plumage is resplendent with"
4521,LINES TO MY LOVE.,green and purple and gold. In the proud breast of the homely and
4522,LINES TO MY LOVE.,unpretentious thrush is hidden the heavenly song. Wherever gentle
4523,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"forbearance is found, wherever patience and tenderness and love idealize"
4524,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"and sweeten life, there you will find woman as heaven meant she should"
4525,LINES TO MY LOVE.,be--the crowned queen of hearth and home. And in saying all this I do
4526,LINES TO MY LOVE.,not wish to be understood as advancing the idea that a woman has no
4527,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"wider scope than home, or that she must be all sugar, without any spice."
4528,LINES TO MY LOVE.,Next to the loud and bold-mannered woman as a specimen to be detested I
4529,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"would put the meek Griselda, with less spirit than a boneless herring"
4530,LINES TO MY LOVE.,and less sparkle than tepid tea. There is no charm left to femininity
4531,LINES TO MY LOVE.,when you add idiocy to a pretty woman's make-up. A fool may be very
4532,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"docile, but a fool is not good company. Of the two, perhaps, if a man"
4533,LINES TO MY LOVE.,were forced to choose a comrade to share a life that was to be cast on a
4534,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"South Sea island, he would do better to take the ""loud"" type. Either"
4535,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"would drive him to the ""cups,"" if such relief were to be found upon an"
4536,LINES TO MY LOVE.,island of the sea. But who would not rather go to wreck in a storm than
4537,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"founder in becalmed waters? Or, to bring it nearer home, who would not"
4538,LINES TO MY LOVE.,rather be drowned away out in the middle of Lake Michigan in a howling
4539,LINES TO MY LOVE.,gale than in a gentle 7×9 cistern? If circumstances call a woman out
4540,LINES TO MY LOVE.,into the thickest of the old bread-and-butter fight that has been waging
4541,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"ever since Eve ran afoul of the apple, it is to her credit if she rolls"
4542,LINES TO MY LOVE.,up her sleeves and goes into the thickest of the scrimmage and holds her
4543,LINES TO MY LOVE.,own with the pluckiest of them all. It is no disgrace to her to be
4544,LINES TO MY LOVE.,quick to seize an opportunity and shrewd to find a point of vantage. Let
4545,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"her rank with the men, and make ever so fine a name for herself in"
4546,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"whatever business vocation she chooses to make her own, it will not"
4547,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"detract one whit from her womanliness, provided she keep herself"
4548,LINES TO MY LOVE.,unsullied of soul and tender of heart. The moment she lends herself to
4549,LINES TO MY LOVE.,practices that lead men to forget to touch their hats when she passes by
4550,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"she becomes unsexed, and a sexless woman is worse than a pestilence, a"
4551,LINES TO MY LOVE.,cyclone and a strike condensed into one vast calamity. No sensible man
4552,LINES TO MY LOVE.,will think any less of a woman if she has spirit enough to get downright
4553,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"mad at injustice, insult or iniquity. I don't know, though, why we women"
4554,LINES TO MY LOVE.,should always get together and compare notes as to what course of
4555,LINES TO MY LOVE.,conduct will best please the men. They don't lie awake nights to conform
4556,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"their behavior to ways and manners that shall please us; but, even"
4557,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"putting our argument on the basis of what shall win approval from men, I"
4558,LINES TO MY LOVE.,repeat that I don't believe that there are many of them who would object
4559,LINES TO MY LOVE.,to a woman knowing how to use a pistol or to her carrying one in case of
4560,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"an unprotected walk, or a night spent in an unguarded home. There would"

4605,LINES TO MY LOVE.,after two days' search found a down-trodden African who said he would
4606,LINES TO MY LOVE.,undertake the job for $1.50. I wish you could have seen the look in the
4607,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"darky's face when he tried to lift the desk. ""Gor-a-mighty, Missus,"
4608,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"what's in that ar desk?"" cried he. I had to unpack every blessed article"
4609,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"but the penknife and a postage stamp before he would move the thing, and"
4610,LINES TO MY LOVE.,all the long day I trotted back and forth with market baskets full of
4611,LINES TO MY LOVE.,the original contents of that desk. When at last I had them moved I
4612,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"couldn't find anything. I wanted my pencils, but haven't seen 'em yet."
4613,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"The paperweight had smashed the ink bottle, and the mucilage had formed"

4615,LINES TO MY LOVE.,frizzes and hairpins and other little what-nots that I kept in the right
4616,LINES TO MY LOVE.,hand drawer had dabbled themselves in the ink and mucilage and fused
4617,LINES TO MY LOVE.,themselves into one indistinguishable horror. I haven't been able to
4618,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"find one thing that I wanted since I moved but a toothpick, and that"

4621,LINES TO MY LOVE.,haven't been seen since they left in the market basket under convoy of
4622,LINES TO MY LOVE.,the Ethiopian. He has probably opened a costumer's shop on Halsted
4623,LINES TO MY LOVE.,street with them. When I move again I shall carry my pencils behind my

4647,LINES TO MY LOVE.,"this that made dear little ""Tom,"" at ""Rugby,"" loyal to his mother's"

4693,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,It fell to my lot the other day to witness a scene that I shall not soon
4694,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,forget. Death has myriad ways of coming to the sons and daughters of
4695,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"men, and it chanced that death had drawn near to a certain dear woman in"
4696,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,a way that well might blanch the cheek of the bravest hero. As surely
4697,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"condemned to die as is the murderer when he hears the judge's sentence,"
4698,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"with absolute hopelessness of any cure, and with the certainty of no"
4699,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"more than a brief span of weeks wherein to live, this brave woman faced"
4700,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"her doom with all the condemned man's certainty, and yet without his"
4701,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"shame. Grown old in a life of peculiar usefulness, with not a single"
4702,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,abated enthusiasm and with a heart as keenly attuned to nature's as is
4703,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"the flute to the master's touch, this dear old heroine calmly renounced"
4704,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"the world she had so loved and turned her face direct to ""headquarters,"""
4705,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,with no friend to interfere between herself and God. For one bitter
4706,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"hour, perhaps, she wept and watched alone in her Gethsemane, then turned"
4707,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,about to await the chariot wheels of her deliverance with a heart as
4708,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,glad and a faith as warm and bright as a little child's who waits in the
4709,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,shadow the coming of a loving father to lead her home. Taken to the
4710,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"hospital to die, knowing that those doors swung for her last entrance"
4711,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"within any earthly home, fully realizing that from beneath that roof"
4712,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"her soul should ascend to its home beyond the stars, bidding good-bye"
4713,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"forever to the sunset skies and the rural walks that she had so loved,"
4714,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"to all the bright company of wild flowers she had known by name, to the"
4715,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"pomp of seasons and the communion of happy homes, she took up her abode"
4716,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,in the ward of the incurables. Every day she sits in the sunshine and
4717,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,reads her books or indites letters to her friends. Every day she
4718,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"struggles with devastating pain, and every day she grows a little"
4719,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"thinner and a little weaker in the body, while her soul springs"
4720,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"heavenward like a white flower from the dust, which no earthly blight"
4721,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,can reach. As I sat by her side the other morning and held her wasted
4722,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,hand in mine it seemed the most natural thing in the world to send a
4723,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"message by this sweet soul to the unseen land, and we almost forgot the"
4724,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,pain of parting in the bright anticipation of the many who would throng
4725,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,to meet the gray-headed voyager when at last her sail should beat across
4726,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,the blue waters into the heavenly harbor. And as we talked there came a
4727,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,message that a very old friend had called to see the sufferer; one who
4728,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,had been the closest comrade of her brilliant youth and the companion
4729,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,of her maturer years. Slowly the guest entered the shrine wherein a soul
4730,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"awaited the sacrament of death, silently she stretched out her arms and"
4731,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,gathered that wasted frame within their close embrace. As a mother
4732,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"comforts the baby at her breast, so they comforted one another with"
4733,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,tender words. The years of their life fell away from them as petals from
4734,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"a rose which the wind lightly rocks, and they were girls again. ""Oh, my"
4735,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"dear child, how sweet, how brave, how grand you are!"" said the guest."
4736,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"""My precious girl, my poor, dear one, how can I bear to see you here!"""
4737,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"she cried again and yet again, while her tears fell like rain, and the"
4738,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,turmoil of her sobs rent her very inmost heart. I shall live long before
4739,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,I see so touching a sight again. In the presence of a love so perfect
4740,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"and so true I felt to be almost an interloper and an alien, so I quietly"
4741,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"stole away and left these two old women, bowed with the weight of many"
4742,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"years, sustaining and sustained by the trust that the portals of the"
4743,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"tomb, within whose shadows they stood, were but the gates that usher the"
4744,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,soul into the full affluence of life and love.

4748,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,It is almost impossible to get the average young person past the
4749,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,florist's window nowadays. She has a way of clasping her hands and
4750,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,pursing her lips over the roses that would make the average young man
4751,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"shed his last dollar, as the almond tree shakes its blossoms. I am"
4752,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,always sorry for a poor young man in love with a pretty girl. He longs
4753,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,to buy the world for her and she longs quite as ardently to receive it
4754,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"as a gift, and so he is hurrying along his bankrupt career until"
4755,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,matrimony or estrangement checks him. Have you not a pitying remembrance
4756,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,in your own heart of a certain youth of the long ago who deluged your
4757,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"house with roses, confectionery and novels until his salary was wildly"
4758,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"wasted in the unequal contests? Girls, be a little less receptive, as it"
4759,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,were; be just a bit more thoughtful and delicate in your orders at the
4760,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"restaurant and your selection from the florist's window, and I think"
4761,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,your matrimonial chances will be the better for it. How often have I
4762,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,seen a young woman order a costly dinner when some young man whom she
4763,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"well knew to be the recipient of a small salary was to foot the bill,"
4764,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,yet when ordering for herself I am told she never goes higher than
4765,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"beans and bread and butter. Now, girls, don't think Amber is an"
4766,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"everlasting old grandmother! Not a bit of it, but she has tossed about"
4767,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"the world so much and heard so many ""little birds"" telling their secrets"
4768,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,that she has taken unto herself quite a pack of knowledge of the ways
4769,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"and manners of mankind. I positively adore a young girl, and always"
4770,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"have, and, what is more, expect I always shall. But admiring and loving"
4771,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"them as I do, from the tip of their bangs to the click of their boot"
4772,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"heels, I cannot bear to see them do unlovely things. I want to see them"
4773,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"helpful, lovable, sweet. I want to see them slow to wound another's"
4774,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"feelings, and quick as sunshine after rain with tender smiles and"
4775,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"womanly ways. I want to see them brave, yet gentle; gay, yet kind;"
4776,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"fun-loving, yet never loud and rude. I want to hear the young men in"
4777,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,speaking of them speak of something besides their extravagance and their
4778,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"greed. I want the very air to be the sweeter for their passing, as when"
4779,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,one carries roses through a room their fragrance lingers. And what shall
4780,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"make you sweet, dear girls? Not fashionable gowns and dainty clothing;"
4781,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,not beauty nor grace nor wealth so much as womanliness and unselfish
4782,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,thought for others.

4786,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,The woman who can wear an arctic overshoe over a No. 5 shoe and make no
4787,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,moan ought to have been born a Joan of Arc or a Charlotte Corday. She is
4788,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"made of the ""dust"" that heroines have a corner on. At one time in my"
4789,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,life I owned a dog--a guileless pup--whose darling aim on earth was to
4790,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,drag my colossal arctics before admiring gentlemen callers and lay them
4791,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"by the fireside, where they overshadowed the big base-burner with their"
4792,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,bulk. I was rid of the dog long before I was rid of the feeling that it
4793,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,was a disgrace for a woman to wear the feet God gave her. The most
4794,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,colossal overshoe is neither so big nor so objectionable as an early
4795,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"grave, and that is just what lies before some of you girls if you don't"
4796,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,quit wearing French heels and going about in damp and chilly weather
4797,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"without protection for your feet. Burn up the high-heeled slippers,"
4798,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"then, with their atrocious shape; cultivate health and common-sense"
4799,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,rather than the empty flattery of a world that cares nothing for you. So
4800,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"shall you be as beautiful as houris, as healthy as Hebes, as long lived"

4806,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,A graveyard never saddens me. It seems nothing more than one of the
4807,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,flies behind the scenes when the actors have gone on in front. What
4808,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,matters the room where we doff our toggery when we are once out of it?
4809,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"So, not long since, when in rambling about one of the Apostle Islands,"
4810,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"away up in Lake Superior country, I ran across a sunshiny little"
4811,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"graveyard, and I was glad to loiter about for an hour and read the"
4812,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,inscriptions on the age-worn stones. It was a blue day--blue in the sky
4813,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"above and blue in the haze on the hills, blue in the sparkling waters of"
4814,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,the lake and bluer yet in the far distance that marked a score of miles
4815,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,from shore. Before the gateway of the graveyard a clump of golden rod
4816,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"stood, like an angel barring the way with a sword of light. A tangle of"
4817,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"luxuriant vines had curtained most of the graves from sight A few, more"
4818,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"carefully tended than the rest, stood bravely out from behind fences of"
4819,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"ornamental woodwork, but most of them were sheltered and peaceful"
4820,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,within their neglected bowers of green. When my time comes to lie down
4821,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"in my narrow home, I pray you, kind gentlefolks, grant me the seclusion"
4822,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,of an unremembered grave rather than the accentuated desolation of a
4823,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"painted fence and a padlocked gate. There is rest in neglect, and"
4824,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"nature, if left alone, will never allow a grave to grow unsightly. She"
4825,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,folds it away in added coverings of mossy green from year to year as a
4826,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,mother when the nights are long will tuck her sleeping children under
4827,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"soft, warm blankets. She appoints her choristers from the leafy belfry"
4828,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,of the woods to keep the chimes ringing when the days are long and slow
4829,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"and sweet, and lights her tapers nightly in the wavering shimmer of the"
4830,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,stars. In a secluded corner we found a handbreadth space where a baby
4831,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,was laid to rest many a year ago. No chronicle of the little life
4832,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"remains, and yet a stranger stands beside its grave and drops a tear. I"
4833,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"don't know why, I'm sure, for why should we cry when a baby dies? So"
4834,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,roses are picked before the frost finds them! Another stone was erected
4835,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,to a young bride who died at twenty. Looking about at the
4836,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"stoop-shouldered, care-lined and prematurely old women who toiled in"
4837,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"those island homes, we could not feel very sorry for the young bride who"
4838,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"died, perhaps, while life still held an illusion. With lingering step at"
4839,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"last we left the graveyard, repassed the golden sentry at the gate and"
4840,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,sought the little boat that awaited us on the beautiful bay. Long after
4841,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,other details of that pleasant outing are forgotten the memory of that
4842,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,blue day among the quiet graves on the island of the great lake shall
4843,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,linger like a song within our hearts.

4850,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,another one to be hunted up when I get over yonder! I shall have to make
4851,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"the acquaintance of a man, prophet or not, who gave utterance to such a"
4852,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"sentiment as that. How many of us, poor earthworms that we are, would"
4853,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,rather spend our dollar for white hyacinths than for a big supper? How
4854,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,many of us ever stop to think that there is something under the sleek
4855,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,rotundity of our girth that demands food quite as eagerly as our stomach
4856,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"does, and fails and faints and dies quite as surely without it? Take"
4857,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"less of the food that goes to fatten the perishable part of you, and"
4858,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"give more sustenance to that inner guest who, like a captive, sits and"
4859,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,starves with long and cruel neglect. Buy fewer glasses of beer and more
4860,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"""white hyacinths."" Smoke less tobacco and invest in a few sunsets and"
4861,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,dawns. Let cheap shows alone and go hear music of the right sort. So
4862,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,shall your soul lift up its drooping head and grow less and less to
4863,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,resemble one of Pharaoh's lean kine. I adore a man or a woman who has
4864,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"enough sentiment to appreciate what dead and gone Mahomet said, and"

4876,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"unreasoning caprices, like the ""What is it?"" and foolish deeds of daring"

4878,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"tendencies which kept us heavy-footed like the fat woman, and others"

4881,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"to the angels who watched us, and the cowardice that kept us in leading"

4883,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"lies we have told, all labeled and dated, like pebbles from the"
4884,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,Mediterranean or bits of shell from the sea. There will be fragments of
4885,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,blighted lives ruined by wagging tongues and shafts of tea table gossip.
4886,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"There will be the old-time masks wherein we masqueraded, and the flimsy"

4888,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"memories of little children we might have kept had we been wiser, and"
4889,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,snatches of lullaby songs. There will be jars full of love glances and

4891,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"mistakes, a Gobelin tapestry to drape the world, and stacks of dead and"
4892,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"withered ""might-have-beens."" There will be peacock feathers of pride"
4893,A BOBOLINK'S SONG.,"tied together with faded ribbons of regret, and whole cabinets full of"

5028,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,of fair women of which a poet once wrote. I dreamed that I sat within a
5029,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,court-room. Before me passed the meanest men and women God ever
5030,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"permitted to live, and upon them I was to pass the verdict as to which"
5031,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"should carry off the palm. The scandal-monger came first, he or she who"
5032,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"sits like a fly-catcher on a tree, snapping up morsels of news. He or"
5033,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,she who is swelled full of conjecture whenever anybody commits an
5034,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"innocent indiscretion, as an owl blinks and ruffles up its feathers when"
5035,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the bobolink sings. He or she who goes about the world like a lean cat
5036,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,after a mouse. He or she who is always looking for clouds in a bright
5037,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"June sky, and slugs in roses and flies in honey. He or she whose heart"
5038,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"is made of brass, and whose soul is so small it will take eleven cycles"
5039,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,of eternity to develop it to the dimension of a hayseed. I was about to
5040,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,hand this specimen the banner without looking further when a being
5041,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,glided by me with a noiseless tread. She wore felt shoes and a mask. She
5042,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"spoke with the voice of a canary, yet had the talons of a vulture. She"
5043,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"wore a stomacher made from the fleece of a lamb, and between her bright"
5044,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"red lips were the tusks of a wolf. I recognized her as the hypocrite,"
5045,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the false friend; she who hands over your living bones for your enemies
5046,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"to pick, while you believe she is your champion and your defender."
5047,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,Following her came the man who keeps his horse standing all day with its
5048,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,nose in a nosebag. There was a groan like the sighing of wind in the
5049,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,poplars as he went by. Then came the merciless man who oppresses and
5050,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,torments the helpless and grinds the faces of the poor; and following
5051,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,him I beheld yet another monster--the worst of all in male attire. He
5052,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"came sneaking around a corner, with a smile on his lips and a devil in"
5053,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"his eye, seeking to entrap innocent girlhood and unsuspecting womanhood."
5054,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,Then came the woman who gives her children to the care of servants while
5055,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"she goes downtown with a dog in her arms. Then came a lean-faced,"
5056,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,weasel-eyed creature with the general expression of a sneak thief. I
5057,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,discovered her to be the representative of that type of women who coaxes
5058,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,her neighbor's hired girl away with promises of better wages. Then came
5059,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the envious person whose evil passions are kindled like the fires of
5060,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"sheol at the prosperity of others, and who, because his own cup of life"
5061,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"holds vinegar, is determined no other shall contain wine. I suddenly"
5062,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,awoke without having bestowed the palm on any. Perhaps some of my

5081,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,not any of these impressed me as the most gruesome of a great city's
5082,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,many sights. As I passed the corner of Washington and Dearborn streets I
5083,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"came face to face with a red-cheeked, wholesome boy of barely twenty"
5084,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"years of age. He was leaning upon the arm of an elderly man, and at"
5085,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"first I thought him ill, but it took but a second glance to see that he"
5086,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"was drunk. Now, I consider that the very saddest sight a great city has"
5087,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,to offer. When the old men are wicked there is some comfort in the
5088,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"thought that their day is nearly spent, and their worthless places may"
5089,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"be soon filled with a nobler and a better stock, but a drunken and"
5090,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,dissolute boy means just what it means for the fruit harvest when the
5091,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,blight gets into the blossom. The gathered apple that rots in the bin is
5092,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"bad enough, but the worm that destroys the fruit in the germ makes"
5093,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,greater loss. Be thankful that the grave has taken to its protecting
5094,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"shelter the boy you loved so dearly, and of whom you were so proud,"
5095,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,rather than that he should have grown to be a drunkard before his

5100,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,We are each of us missing constant chances to bestow a kindness upon
5101,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,some needy soul for the reason that we dread being imposed upon by a
5102,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,case of causeless complaining. Is it worth while to keep our hearts
5103,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,stolid merely because we may be cheated in the bestowal of a nickel's
5104,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,worth of alms? I think not. You looked up from your work a few minutes
5105,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,ago and saw a little boy not much bigger than your thumb looking through
5106,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the open doorway. He began at once a sing-song tale of woe about a sick
5107,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"mother and a father out of work--or in his grave, it doesn't much"
5108,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,matter. At the same time he held out a paper of cheap pins to tempt a

5110,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5111,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"""I have no time to bother with such as you,"" you said, and turned your"

5113,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,again and noticed that the small hand that held the pins was well kept
5114,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"and very, very thin. Then your eyes followed the diminutive form down to"
5115,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"the feet; they, too, showed signs of somebody's care, although the shoes"
5116,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,were shabby and the stockings thin.
5117,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5118,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"""He is not an ordinary little beggar,"" you said to yourself. And then"

5120,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,so full of trouble and of entreaty that they looked like twin Killarney

5126,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,a sunburst to follow the rain. That was an opportunity you nearly
5127,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"missed, but it brought a blessing sweeter than a Crawford peach. You"
5128,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"didn't want the pins, but the little desolate heart wanted the kind word"

5229,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,There is just one thing in the latter part of the nineteenth century
5230,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"that never fails to bring success, and that is assurance. If you are"
5231,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,going to make yourself known it is no longer the thing to quietly pass
5232,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,out a visiting card--you must advance with a trumpet and blow a brazen
5233,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,blast to shake the stars. The time has gone by when self-advancement
5234,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,can be gained by modest and unassuming methods. To stand with a lifted
5235,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,hat and solicit a hearing savors of mendicancy and an humble spirit. The
5236,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"easily abashed and the diffident may starve in a garret, or go die on"
5237,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the highways--there is no chance for them in the jostling rush of life.
5238,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"The gilded circus chariot, with a full brass band and a plump goddess"
5239,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"distributing circulars, is what takes the popular heart by storm. Your"
5240,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"silent entry into town, depending upon the merits of your wares to gain"
5241,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"an audience or work up a custom, is chimerical and obsolete. We no"
5242,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,longer sit in the shadow and play flutes; we mount a pine platform and
5243,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"blow on a trombone, and in that way we draw a crowd, and that is what we"
5244,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,live for. Who are the women who succeed in business ventures of any
5245,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"sort? Mostly the mannish, bold, aggressive amazons who are unmindful of"
5246,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,rebuffs and impervious to contempt. Who are the men who wear diamonds
5247,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,and live easy lives? Largely the politicians who have made their
5248,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"reputation in bar-room rostrums and among sharpers. Oh, for a wind to"
5249,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,blow us forward a hundred years out of this age of sordid self-seeking
5250,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,and impudent assertiveness into something larger and sweeter and finer.
5251,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,Give us less yeast in our bread and more substance; fill our cups with
5252,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"wine rather than froth, and for sweet pity's sake hang up the great"
5253,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"American trumpet and let ""silence, like a poultice, come to heal the"
5254,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"blows of sound."""

5258,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"Every day, for months, as I have taken my morning ride to town I have"
5259,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,noticed a dog who bounds forth from a dooryard that overlooks the busy
5260,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,highway of the steed of steam and barks himself weak at the rushing
5261,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"trains. He really accomplishes nothing, but do you suppose you could"
5262,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,convince his canine brain that he was not at once a reproach and a
5263,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,terror to the numerous trains that disturb his rest? He reminds me of
5264,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,certain people we meet all the way through life. They bark at trains
5265,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"continually while the Lord prolongs their breath, and the faster the"
5266,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,train and the more it carries the louder they bark. They fondly imagine
5267,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,that the voice of their ranting protest accomplishes a purpose in the
5268,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,world. They are always barking at capital and at rich men and at
5269,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"corporations. They bark at people of courteous manners, and all the ways"
5270,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"and customs of polite and gentle society, with fierce and futile"
5271,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,yelpings. They bark at the swift advancement of the world from ignorance
5272,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"to enlightenment, from superstition to liberalism. They bark at the"
5273,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,churches because they are on a train that has sidetracked Calvin. They
5274,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"bark at polite young men who wear clean linen, and call them dudes; they"
5275,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,bark at women who have one or two ideas outside of fashionable folly and
5276,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"inane conventionalism, and call them cranks; they bark at everything on"
5277,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"wheels, where wheels typify strength and achievement. They will go on"
5278,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"barking, too, while the world finds room and maintains patience for them"
5279,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,and their barking.

5283,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,I think I have said before that I loathe meek people. But even if I have
5284,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,I am going to say it again. Your half-wits who sit and turn first one
5285,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,cheek and then the other to be slapped are not the sort for me. The man
5286,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"or woman, boy or girl, child or otherwise, that will endure direct"
5287,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,insult day after day without resenting it ought to sell themselves at
5288,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,so much a pint for illuminating oil--that is all they are good for. I
5289,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"love a fighter, provided he foils gracefully and does not snatch out his"
5290,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"sword in every brawling and unworthy cause. In the defense of woman, in"
5291,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"the cause of honor, purity and truth; in battle against sordidness, and"
5292,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"greed, and a lying tongue, let your blade flash like summer rain and"
5293,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"your white plume outdistance the plume of Navarre! For God and mother,"
5294,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"justice and honor, self-respect and the approval of our own conscience,"
5295,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"let us go forward then with a chip, if need be, on each shoulder and a"
5296,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,standard copy of the celestial army tactics in our side pocket! The Lord
5297,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"loves a good many things, cheerful givers and self-sacrificing widows"
5298,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"with their mites, merciful men and sweet and noble women, but most of"
5299,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"all, I think, he loves a valiant fighter in the cause of right."

5302,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5303,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,Now it came to pass that there dwelt in a certain city of the land of
5304,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"the great lakes a woman called Lydia, sister to Simon, the shipwright."
5305,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And Lydia, being comely and fair to look upon, was sought in marriage"
5306,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"by one John, a dealer in spices and fine teas. And the years of their"
5307,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"wedlock having outnumbered the fingers upon a man's two hands, it came"
5308,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,to pass that they dwelt together in exceeding prosperity in a town near
5309,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,by the blue waters of a mighty lake.
5310,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5311,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And Heaven sent unto them children to the number of three, so that their"
5312,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"hearts were exceeding glad, and the cords of their habitation were"
5313,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,stretched from year to year. And it came to pass that the home in which
5314,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"they lived was spacious and full of salubrious air. Their beds, also,"
5315,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"were of curled hair, and all their bed-springs of beaten steel. And"
5316,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,bath-rooms made glad the heart of the dust-laden when summer dwelt in
5317,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the land. Also there were cunningly devised screens of fine wire in all
5318,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"the windows, so that the marauding fly and the pestilential mosquito"
5319,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,might not enter.
5320,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5321,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And the flesh increased from year to year upon the bones of Lydia and
5322,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"the children that heaven sent her, while they remained in the home that"
5323,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"John, the tea merchant, had given them."
5324,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5325,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,But it came to pass that the neighbors of the woman Lydia closed up the
5326,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"shutters of their dwellings, and one by one stole from town when the"
5327,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,heat descended upon the land.
5328,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5329,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"Then spake Lydia unto John, the vender of spices and fine teas, saying:"
5330,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5331,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"""Arise, let us go hence and dwell within a farm-house, where the"
5332,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"children may leap together in the sweet-smelling hay, and I may comfort"
5333,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"myself with flagons of cream."""
5334,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5335,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"But John, being a man among men, and accounted somewhat wise withal,"
5336,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"would have restrained Lydia, saying: ""Not so; for verily I say unto you,"
5337,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"comfort abideth not in the dwelling of the farmer, neither does joy"
5338,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"linger in the shadow of his doorway."""
5339,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5340,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"Now Lydia, being president of a Woman's Club and reputed of knowledge"
5341,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"beyond the generality of womankind, would not listen, but beat her hands"
5342,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"together, crying: ""I prithee hold thy peace, for behold, I and the"
5343,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,children heaven sent me will depart hence by to-morrow's chariot of
5344,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"steam, and will make our home with the gentle farmer and his"
5345,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"sweet-breathed kine."""
5346,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5347,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"So John, being loth to war with the tongue, albeit he was heavy-hearted"
5348,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"and walked with a bent head, purchased tickets for Lydia and the"
5349,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,children heaven had given her.
5350,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5351,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And it came to pass that they left town by the train which men call ""the"
5352,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"limited."""
5353,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5354,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,Now the way of that train through the land is like unto the way of a
5355,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"ship at sea, or of a strong eagle that never wearieth. And the"
5356,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,sufferings of Lydia were such that she sought relief in peppermint and
5357,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,found it not.
5358,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5359,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And the babes by reason of the swiftness with which they traversed a
5360,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"crooked land, were made ill and languished like sea-sick rangers of the"
5361,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,deep.
5362,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5363,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"Yet, after many hours, their torment abated not, so that, reaching their"
5364,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"destination, the bodies of Lydia and her children were removed in a hack"
5365,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,and hurried to an inn that was built near by.
5366,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5367,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And in the inn where they were fain to tarry until strength should be
5368,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"given them for further journeying, it chanced that a young babe lay"
5369,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,sorely stricken with the whooping-cough.
5370,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5371,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"Now, when Lydia knew this, her heart fainted with fear, and she"
5372,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,prophesied evil.
5373,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5374,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"For well she knew that her own babes had not had the disease, and that"
5375,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the time of their prostration was at hand.
5376,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5377,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"So Lydia, being president of a Woman's Club, and accounted without a"
5378,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"peer in the gift of words, sent for the keeper of the inn, that she"
5379,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,might rebuke him.
5380,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5381,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And she opened her mouth impulsively and questioned him saying: ""Why"
5382,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,broughtest thou me and the children heaven gave me into thine inn
5383,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"knowing that contagious disease lurked within its gates?"""
5384,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5385,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And the keeper of the inn shot out the lip at her and was undismayed.
5386,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5387,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And he cried, ""Go to! And what wouldst thou of a public house? Thou"
5388,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"talkest like one with little sense!"""
5389,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5390,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And it came to pass that Lydia and her children departed thence by stage
5391,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"and sought the farm-house. And, arriving there, they would have laid"
5392,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"themselves down to rest, being sorely bruised by reason of protracted"
5393,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,stage-riding.
5394,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5395,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,But the beds were made of straw and corded underneath with ropes. So
5396,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"that lying upon them caused the children to roar loudly, and they found"
5397,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"rest from their lamentations, four in a bed, on the bosom of Lydia."
5398,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5399,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And, supper being served, it consisted of tinted warm water and"
5400,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,gooseberries sweetened with brown sugar.
5401,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5402,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"Now Lydia, by reason of her connection with the club, was enabled to"
5403,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"speak boldly, and she called for cream."
5404,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5405,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"But the wife of the farmer made answer, saying, ""We have none."""
5406,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5407,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And Lydia spoke yet again, saying, ""Why, O woman of many wiles, hast"
5408,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"thou no cream?"""
5409,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5410,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And the woman made way with an insect that swam gaily in a pitcher of
5411,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"azure milk, and said gently, ""Because we sell it to a neighboring"
5412,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"dairy."""
5413,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5414,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And Lydia said nothing, but remembering the words of John, the"
5415,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"tea-merchant, wept silently."
5416,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5417,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And it came to pass that next morning the children went forth to leap in
5418,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the hay.
5419,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5420,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And the farmer led them firmly away from the hay-mow by the tip of the
5421,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"ear, saying, ""I allow no children to spoil my fodder."""
5422,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5423,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And the morning of the second day, the woman Lydia, being starved for"
5424,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"nutritious food, wended her way with her babes across a stretch of"
5425,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,pasture land in search of wild blackberries.
5426,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5427,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And a beast, whose voice was baritone and whose approach was like the"
5428,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"approach of a Kansas cyclone, bore down upon her and the children"
5429,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"heaven had given her, while yet they were midway in the meadow. Now only"
5430,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,by leaping could they save themselves.
5431,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5432,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,And it came to pass that they leaped mightily and flung themselves over
5433,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,a five-barred fence.
5434,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5435,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And a snake made free with the draperies of Lydia, so that her hair"
5436,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"whitened with fear, and between the beast with the baritone voice and"
5437,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,the serpent she knew not which way to turn.
5438,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,
5439,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"And the morning of the third day she wrote to John, the tea-merchant,"
5440,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,saying only:

5442,SLEEP'S SERENADE.,"""My darling--Meet the first train that returns from this place to the"

5507,IMPATIENCE.,"If there is anything more utterly desolate than a poorly-conducted farm,"
5508,IMPATIENCE.,preserve me from it. There is an ideal farm familiar to the writers of
5509,IMPATIENCE.,"pretty tales, where everything is kept in apple-pie order throughout"
5510,IMPATIENCE.,"the year, and where one can walk broadcast, so to speak, in a spick and"
5511,IMPATIENCE.,span white gown without attracting so much as the shadow of a shade of
5512,IMPATIENCE.,minutest defilement. We have seen pictures of such farms wherein sleek
5513,IMPATIENCE.,"cattle stood around knee-deep in dewy clover, or lay serenely on"
5514,IMPATIENCE.,"polished hillsides, or meandered dreamily by crystal streams; wherein"
5515,IMPATIENCE.,"pale pink farm-houses with green gables and yellow piazzas, fairly"
5516,IMPATIENCE.,"scintillated from behind decorous foliage, and peacocks, with tails"
5517,IMPATIENCE.,"nearly as long as the Mississippi River, posed on the gate-posts;"
5518,IMPATIENCE.,wherein neat little boys in variegated trousers rode prancing chargers
5519,IMPATIENCE.,"down blooming lanes, and correct little girls in ruffled underclothing"
5520,IMPATIENCE.,fed well-mannered chickens from morning till night. But the actual farm
5521,IMPATIENCE.,of the remote rural districts is about as much like its ideal picture as
5522,IMPATIENCE.,Esau was like a modern dude. Not long ago somebody suggested that I go
5523,IMPATIENCE.,"and board for a fortnight at a farm-house. ""You will have perfect rest,"""
5524,IMPATIENCE.,"said my friend, ""and that is what you need."" So I went, and rather than"
5525,IMPATIENCE.,again undergo the torments of the five days spent in that restful (?)
5526,IMPATIENCE.,spot I think I would cheerfully hire out with a Siberian chain-gang. In
5527,IMPATIENCE.,the first place there was no such a thing as rest possible after the
5528,IMPATIENCE.,"first glimmer of each day's dawn. Every rooster on the farm, and there"
5529,IMPATIENCE.,"were millions of them, was up ""for keeps"" long before sunrise. Their"
5530,IMPATIENCE.,united chorus smote the skies. One might as well have tried to sleep
5531,IMPATIENCE.,through Gettysburg's battle. A score or so of bereaved cows lamented all
5532,IMPATIENCE.,"night for their murdered babies, and a couple of donkeys, kept purely"
5533,IMPATIENCE.,"for ornamental purposes, made sounds every half hour or so that turned"
5534,IMPATIENCE.,my hair snow white with terror. After breakfast each day I used to walk
5535,IMPATIENCE.,"down the hill and fish for pickerel in a river that had no current, and"
5536,IMPATIENCE.,"looked discouraged. ""Walked,"" did I say? Nay, there was nothing so"
5537,IMPATIENCE.,"decorous as a walk possible down the slippery, stony descent which led"
5538,IMPATIENCE.,"to the haunts of the pickerel. When I didn't hurl myself down that hill,"
5539,IMPATIENCE.,"I slid down, and between the two methods I wrecked both muscle and shoe"
5540,IMPATIENCE.,leather. The latter part of the way led through a pasture devoted to
5541,IMPATIENCE.,several cows and a bull. As I am more afraid of the latter than of death
5542,IMPATIENCE.,"and all his cohorts, my morning walks ended in heart failures and had to"
5543,IMPATIENCE.,be abandoned. Occasionally I would take a book and go out and sit in my
5544,IMPATIENCE.,"hammock. Then the large roosters, each one of them at least seven feet"
5545,IMPATIENCE.,"tall and highly ruffled about the legs, would come around and look at"
5546,IMPATIENCE.,"me, so that I would have to go into the house to hide my embarrassment."
5547,IMPATIENCE.,"I know of nothing harder to endure than the stare of a Brahma fowl,"

5551,IMPATIENCE.,"Nothing happened while I was at the farm but meal time, and the"
5552,IMPATIENCE.,intervals were so long between those episodes that I used to wonder
5553,IMPATIENCE.,daily at my own mission subsequent to the farm-life as one gropes for
5554,IMPATIENCE.,prehistoric clues. There was a man about the premises who walked to and
5555,IMPATIENCE.,from the village twice a day with a large brown jug. When I asked at
5556,IMPATIENCE.,"different times what he fetched in the jug, not because I wanted to"
5557,IMPATIENCE.,"know, but merely to find a topic of conversation, I was successively"
5558,IMPATIENCE.,"told that it was ""kerosene,"" ""maple molasses,"" ""buttermilk,"" and"
5559,IMPATIENCE.,"""vinegar."" I wish I knew if I was told the truth every time, or if"
5560,IMPATIENCE.,somebody tried to impose upon me merely because I was town-bred.

5562,IMPATIENCE.,Occasionally we took rides over stony trails where boulders and ruts
5563,IMPATIENCE.,"marked the way, and only the creaking of our bones broke the primeval"
5564,IMPATIENCE.,silence. These rides were supposed to be part of the generous plan of
5565,IMPATIENCE.,"contemplated rest, but a few more of them would have resulted in the"
5566,IMPATIENCE.,"rest from which there is no awaking. No, my dear, I am an ardent lover"
5567,IMPATIENCE.,"of the country, and I love it as the epicure loves a good dinner, or the"
5568,IMPATIENCE.,"musician loves music, but I will take it, please, without the"
5569,IMPATIENCE.,accessories of a poorly-kept hoosier farm. I do not yearn for the
5570,IMPATIENCE.,"defilements of a barn-yard that is never cleansed, nor for the"
5571,IMPATIENCE.,"frolicsomeness of pigs that wander at their own sweet will, nor for the"
5572,IMPATIENCE.,"clamor of aggressively alert poultry, nor for piscatorial delights. I"
5573,IMPATIENCE.,love the country as God made it before greed and gain and all the
5574,IMPATIENCE.,abominations of man entered into and spoiled it. I love it clean and
5575,IMPATIENCE.,"wholesome and sweet, as it was turned out of the workshop; its streams"
5576,IMPATIENCE.,"untainted, and their banks unbereft of beautiful trees; its hills still"
5577,IMPATIENCE.,"covered with verdure, and its winds uncontaminated with the scent of"
5578,IMPATIENCE.,defiling drains and waterways.

5599,IMPATIENCE.,consumptive's grave or are sneezing upon their catarrhal pilgrimage to
5600,IMPATIENCE.,"the tomb.'"" The man was worth looking at, hale and hearty, his chest like"
5601,IMPATIENCE.,"the convex curve of a barrel, his eye like a falcon's."
5602,IMPATIENCE.,
5603,IMPATIENCE.,"""But,"" said my friend, ""were I to throw aside my overcoat and go forth"

5608,IMPATIENCE.,coddled yourself so long between blankets and absorbed red-hot furnace
5609,IMPATIENCE.,heat until you haven't the stamina of an aspen leaf. Take a hot-house
5610,IMPATIENCE.,flower out of doors and it soon wilts. But mark the beautiful Edelweiss
5611,IMPATIENCE.,"of the Alps--it thrives in the pure breath of eternal snow."" But what is"
5612,IMPATIENCE.,the use of talking? Although my tongue became a golden bell and my pen a
5613,IMPATIENCE.,"gleaming flame, I could never convince you, my dear old, shivery, shaky"
5614,IMPATIENCE.,"public, of the advantage of fresh air and plenty of it, and the"
5615,IMPATIENCE.,advisability of a generous cultivation of nature and her free gifts. As
5616,IMPATIENCE.,well expect to be nourished by looking at your food through an opera

5618,IMPATIENCE.,"pure air and sunshine, or in spite of the devices you plan to shut"
5619,IMPATIENCE.,"yourself away and hermetically seal your body, as it were, from the"
5620,IMPATIENCE.,"sweet, health-giving influence of sun and wind and frost. Just stop a"
5621,IMPATIENCE.,"moment before you turn away from this subject, my dear, and hear a"
5622,IMPATIENCE.,"little story. I know the subject is a bore and that I am a crank, but"
5623,IMPATIENCE.,listen. Once there was a grand beneficent power--call it God if you
5624,IMPATIENCE.,will--who planned a spot wherein to place some atom which he had shaped
5625,IMPATIENCE.,out of dust and vivified with a spark of his own life. He looked about a
5626,IMPATIENCE.,"little, we will imagine, and finally settled upon a garden wherein to"
5627,IMPATIENCE.,"place these precious pensioners on his care. A roofless, wall-less spot"
5628,IMPATIENCE.,"full of draughts and dew, breezes and blossoms. He filled it with birds"
5629,IMPATIENCE.,"and carpeted it with grass, set rivulets running through it for ""water"
5630,IMPATIENCE.,"works"" and sunbeams and starbeams for ""electric light"" plants, etc. That"
5631,IMPATIENCE.,is all I have to say. Like the Mother Morey legend my story is done
5632,IMPATIENCE.,"before it is scarcely begun. But ask yourself the question, Why didn't"
5633,IMPATIENCE.,God put his well-beloved models of the forthcoming race into a more
5634,IMPATIENCE.,"sheltered place if there was so much danger in fresh air, draughts and"
5635,IMPATIENCE.,chilly weather? Why didn't he seal them up behind double windows in an
5636,IMPATIENCE.,"airless, sunless, hot and unhealthful home where the dear things could"
5637,IMPATIENCE.,"keep warm? Because he was God and knew everything, and not man and knew"
5638,IMPATIENCE.,nothing.

5645,IMPATIENCE.,"pieces on the breakers before ever sighting land again, and a hundred to"
