224,THE MAPLE TREE,
225,THE MAPLE TREE,
226,THE MAPLE TREE,An April sun with April showers
227,THE MAPLE TREE,Had burst the buds of lagging flowers;
228,THE MAPLE TREE,From their fresh leaves the violets’ eyes
229,THE MAPLE TREE,Mirrored the deep blue of the skies;
230,THE MAPLE TREE,"The daffodils, in clustering ranks,"
231,THE MAPLE TREE,"Fringed with their spears the garden banks,"
232,THE MAPLE TREE,And with the blooms I love so well
233,THE MAPLE TREE,"Their paper buds began to swell,"
234,THE MAPLE TREE,While every bush and every tree
235,THE MAPLE TREE,Burgeoned with flowers of melody;
236,THE MAPLE TREE,From the quick robin with his range
237,THE MAPLE TREE,"Of silver notes, a warbling change,"
238,THE MAPLE TREE,Which he from sad to merry drew
239,THE MAPLE TREE,"A sparkling shower of tuneful dew,"
240,THE MAPLE TREE,To the brown sparrow in the wheat
241,THE MAPLE TREE,A plaintive whistle clear and sweet.
242,THE MAPLE TREE,Over my head the royal sky
243,THE MAPLE TREE,"Spread clear from cloud his canopy,"
244,THE MAPLE TREE,The idle noon slept far and wide
245,THE MAPLE TREE,"On misty hill and river side,"
246,THE MAPLE TREE,And far below me glittering lay
247,THE MAPLE TREE,The mirror of the azure bay.
248,THE MAPLE TREE,
249,THE MAPLE TREE,I stood beneath the maple tree;
250,THE MAPLE TREE,"Its crimson blooms enchanted me,"
251,THE MAPLE TREE,"Its honey perfume haunted me,"
252,THE MAPLE TREE,"And drew me thither unaware,"
253,THE MAPLE TREE,A nameless influence in the air.
254,THE MAPLE TREE,Its boughs were hung with murmuring bees
255,THE MAPLE TREE,Who robbed it of its sweetnesses--
256,THE MAPLE TREE,"Their cheerful humming, loud and strong,"
257,THE MAPLE TREE,"Drowned with its bass the robin’s song,"
258,THE MAPLE TREE,And filled the April noontide air
259,THE MAPLE TREE,With Labor’s universal prayer.
260,THE MAPLE TREE,I paused to listen--soon I heard
261,THE MAPLE TREE,"A sound of neither bee nor bird,"
262,THE MAPLE TREE,A sullen murmur mixed with cheer
263,THE MAPLE TREE,That rose and fell upon the ear
264,THE MAPLE TREE,As the wind might--yet far away
265,THE MAPLE TREE,"Unstirred the sleeping river lay,"
266,THE MAPLE TREE,And even across the hillside wheat
267,THE MAPLE TREE,No silvery ripples wandered fleet.
268,THE MAPLE TREE,"It was the murmur of the town,"
269,THE MAPLE TREE,No song of bird or bee could drown--
270,THE MAPLE TREE,"The rattling wheels along the street,"
271,THE MAPLE TREE,"The pushing crowd with hasty feet,"
272,THE MAPLE TREE,"The schoolboy’s call, the gossip’s story,"
273,THE MAPLE TREE,"The lawyer’s purchased oratory,"
274,THE MAPLE TREE,"The glib-tongued shopman with his wares,"
275,THE MAPLE TREE,"The chattering schoolgirl with her airs,"
276,THE MAPLE TREE,"The moaning sick man on his bed,"
277,THE MAPLE TREE,"The coffin nailing for the dead,"
278,THE MAPLE TREE,"The new-born infant’s lusty wail,"
279,THE MAPLE TREE,"The bells that bade the bridal hail,"
280,THE MAPLE TREE,The factory’s wheels that round and round
281,THE MAPLE TREE,"Forever turn, and with their sound"
282,THE MAPLE TREE,Make the young children deaf to all
283,THE MAPLE TREE,"God’s voices that about them call,"
284,THE MAPLE TREE,Sweet sounds of bird and wind and wave;
285,THE MAPLE TREE,And Life no gladder than a grave.
286,THE MAPLE TREE,
287,THE MAPLE TREE,"These myriad, mingled human voices,"
288,THE MAPLE TREE,These intertwined and various noises
289,THE MAPLE TREE,Made up the murmur that I heard
290,THE MAPLE TREE,Through the sweet hymn of bee and bird.
291,THE MAPLE TREE,I said--“If all these sounds of life
292,THE MAPLE TREE,"With which the noontide air is rife,"
293,THE MAPLE TREE,These busy murmurings of the bee
294,THE MAPLE TREE,"Robbing the honied maple tree,"
295,THE MAPLE TREE,"These warblings of the song-birds’ voices,"
296,THE MAPLE TREE,"With which the blooming hedge rejoices,"
297,THE MAPLE TREE,These harsher mortal chords that rise
298,THE MAPLE TREE,"To mar Earth’s anthem to the skies,"
299,THE MAPLE TREE,If all these sounds fall on my ear
300,THE MAPLE TREE,So little varying--yet so near--
301,THE MAPLE TREE,How can I tell if God can know
302,THE MAPLE TREE,A cry of human joy or woe
303,THE MAPLE TREE,"From the loud humming of the bee,"
304,THE MAPLE TREE,Or the blithe robin’s melody?”
305,THE MAPLE TREE,
306,THE MAPLE TREE,God sitteth somewhere in his heaven--
307,THE MAPLE TREE,About him sing the planets seven;
308,THE MAPLE TREE,"With every thought a world is made,"
309,THE MAPLE TREE,To grow in sun or droop in shade;
310,THE MAPLE TREE,He holds Creation like a flower
311,THE MAPLE TREE,In his right hand--an æon’s hour--
312,THE MAPLE TREE,"It fades, it dies,--another’s bloom"
313,THE MAPLE TREE,Makes the air sweet with fresh perfume.
314,THE MAPLE TREE,"Or, did he listen on that day"
315,THE MAPLE TREE,To what the rolling Earth might say?
316,THE MAPLE TREE,"Or, did he mark, as, one by one,"
317,THE MAPLE TREE,The gliding hours in light were spun?
318,THE MAPLE TREE,And if he heard the choral hymn
319,THE MAPLE TREE,"The Earth sent up to honor him,"
320,THE MAPLE TREE,Which note rose sweetest to his ear?
321,THE MAPLE TREE,Which murmur did he gladliest hear?

330,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,_Poem founded on a Rabinnical Legend_
331,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,
332,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,
333,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Abram and Zimri owned a field together,"
334,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"A level field, hid in a happy vale;"
335,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"They ploughed it with one plough, and in the spring"
336,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Sowed, walking side by side, the fruitful grain;"
337,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Each carried to his home one-half the sheaves,"
338,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And stored them, with much labor, in his barns."
339,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Now Abram had a wife and seven sons,"
340,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,But Zimri dwelt alone within his house.
341,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"One night, before the sheaves were gathered in,"
342,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"As Zimri lay upon his lonely bed,"
343,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And counted in his mind his little gains,"
344,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"He thought upon his brother Abram’s lot,"
345,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And said, “I dwell alone within my house,"
346,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,But Abram hath a wife and seven sons;
347,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And yet we share the harvest sheaves alike:
348,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,He surely needeth more for life than I:
349,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"I will arise and gird myself, and go"
350,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Down to the field, and add to his from mine.”"
351,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"So he arose and girded up his loins,"
352,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And went out softly to the level field.
353,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"The moon shone out from dusky bars of clouds,"
354,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"The trees stood black against the cold blue sky,"
355,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,The branches waved and whispered in the wind.
356,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"So Zimri, guided by the shifting light,"
357,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Went down the mountain path, and found the field;"
358,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Took from his store of sheave a generous third,"
359,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And bore them gladly to his brother’s heap,"
360,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And then went back to sleep and happy dreams.
361,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,
362,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Now that same night, as Abram lay in bed,"
363,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Thinking upon his blissful state in life,"
364,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"He thought upon his brother Zimri’s lot,"
365,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And said, “He dwells within his house alone,"
366,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"He goeth forth to toil with few to help,"
367,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"He goeth home at night to a cold house,"
368,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And hath few other friends but me and mine
369,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"(For these two tilled the happy vale alone),"
370,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"While I, whom Heaven hath very greatly blessed,"
371,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Dwell happy with my wife and seven sons,"
372,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Who aid me in my toil, and make it light;"
373,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And yet we share the harvest sheaves alike;
374,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"This, surely, is not pleasing unto God."
375,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"I will arise and gird myself, and go"
376,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Out to the field, and borrow from my store,"
377,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And add unto my brother Zimri’s pile.”
378,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,
379,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"So he arose and girded up his loins,"
380,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And went down softly to the level field.
381,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"The moon shone out from silver bars of clouds,"
382,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"The trees stood black against the starry sky,"
383,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,The dark leaves waved and whispered in the breeze;
384,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"So Abram, guided by the doubtful light,"
385,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Passed down the mountain path, and found the field,"
386,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Took from his store of sheaves a generous third,"
387,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And added them unto his brother’s heap;
388,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,Then he went back to sleep and happy dreams.
389,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,
390,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"So the next morning, with the early sun,"
391,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,The brothers rose and went out to their toil;
392,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And when they came to see the heavy sheaves,"
393,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Each wondered in his heart to find his heap,"
394,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Though he had given a third, was still the same."
395,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,
396,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Now the next night went Zimri to the field,"
397,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,Took from his store of sheaves a generous share
398,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And placed them on his brother Abram’s heap;
399,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And then lay down behind his pile to watch.
400,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"The moon looked out from bars of silvery cloud,"
401,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"The cedars stood up black against the sky,"
402,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,The olive branches whispered in the wind.
403,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Then Abram came down softly from his home,"
404,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And, looking to the left and right, went on,"
405,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Took from his ample store a generous third,"
406,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,And laid it on his brother Zimri’s pile.
407,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Then Zimri rose and caught him in his arms,"
408,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And wept upon his neck and kissed his cheek,"
409,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"And Abram saw the whole, and could not speak,"
410,ABRAM AND ZIMRI,"Neither could Zimri, for their hearts were full."

442,AN APRIL VIOLET,The sparrows cannot sing;
443,AN APRIL VIOLET,Is this the reason why
444,AN APRIL VIOLET,Thou look’st so woefully?
445,AN APRIL VIOLET,
446,AN APRIL VIOLET,To-morrow’s laughing sun
447,AN APRIL VIOLET,"Will cheer thee, pallid one;"
448,AN APRIL VIOLET,To-morrow will bring back
449,AN APRIL VIOLET,"The gay bee on his track,"
450,AN APRIL VIOLET,Bursting thy cloister dim
451,AN APRIL VIOLET,With his wild roistering.
452,AN APRIL VIOLET,
453,AN APRIL VIOLET,"Canst thou not wait the morrow,"
454,AN APRIL VIOLET,That rids thee of thy sorrow?
455,AN APRIL VIOLET,Art thou too desolate
456,AN APRIL VIOLET,To smile at any fate?
457,AN APRIL VIOLET,Then there is naught for thee
458,AN APRIL VIOLET,But Death’s delivery.
