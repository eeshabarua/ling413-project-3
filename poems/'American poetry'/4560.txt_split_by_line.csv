26,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
27,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Nourished by peaceful suns and gracious dew,"
28,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Your sweet youth budded and your sweet lives grew,"
29,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,And all the world seemed rose-beset for you.
30,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
31,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"The rose of beauty was your mutual dower,"
32,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"The stainless rose of love, an early flower,"
33,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,The stately blooms of ease and wealth and power.
34,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
35,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"And treading thus on pathways flower-bestrewn,"
36,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"It well might be, that, cold and careless grown,"
37,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,You both had lived for your own joys alone.
38,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
39,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"But, holding all these fair things as in trust."
40,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Gently you walked, still scattering on the dust"
41,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Of harder roads, which others tread, and must,--"
42,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
43,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Your heritage of brightness, not a ray"
44,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Of noontide sought you out, but straight away"
45,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,You caught and halved it with some darker day:
46,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
47,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"And as the sweet saint's loaves were turned, it is said,"
48,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"To roses, so your roses turned to bread,"
49,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,That hungering souls and weary might be fed.
50,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
51,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Dear friends, my poor words do but paint you wrong,"
52,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Nor can I utter, in one trivial song,"
53,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,The goodness I have honored for so long.
54,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,
55,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"Only this leaf, a single petal flung,"
56,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,"One chord from a full harmony unsung,"
57,TO J. H.  AND E. W. H.,May speak the life-long love that lacks a tongue.

148,PRELUDE.,"They bloom on earthly trees,"
149,PRELUDE.,"Poised on a low-hung stem,"

151,PRELUDE.,Who cannot fly to where
152,PRELUDE.,The heavenly gardens are.
153,PRELUDE.,
154,PRELUDE.,So I by devious ways
155,PRELUDE.,Have pulled some easy sprays
156,PRELUDE.,From the down-dropping bough
157,PRELUDE.,"Which all may reach, and now"
158,PRELUDE.,"I knot them, bud and leaf,"
159,PRELUDE.,Into a rhymed sheaf.
160,PRELUDE.,
161,PRELUDE.,Not mine the pinion strong
162,PRELUDE.,To win the nobler song;
163,PRELUDE.,I only cull and bring
164,PRELUDE.,A hedge-row offering

185,COMMISSIONED.,
186,COMMISSIONED.,
187,COMMISSIONED.,"What can I do for thee, Beloved,"
188,COMMISSIONED.,Whose feet so little while ago
189,COMMISSIONED.,"Trod the same way-side dust with mine,"
190,COMMISSIONED.,And now up paths I do not know
191,COMMISSIONED.,"Speed, without sound or sign?"
192,COMMISSIONED.,
193,COMMISSIONED.,What can I do? The perfect life
194,COMMISSIONED.,All fresh and fair and beautiful
195,COMMISSIONED.,Has opened its wide arms to thee;
196,COMMISSIONED.,Thy cup is over-brimmed and full;
197,COMMISSIONED.,Nothing remains for me.
198,COMMISSIONED.,
199,COMMISSIONED.,"I used to do so many things,--"
200,COMMISSIONED.,Love thee and chide thee and caress;
201,COMMISSIONED.,"Brush little straws from off thy way,"
202,COMMISSIONED.,Tempering with my poor tenderness
203,COMMISSIONED.,The heat of thy short day.
204,COMMISSIONED.,
205,COMMISSIONED.,"Not much, but very sweet to give;"
206,COMMISSIONED.,And it is grief of griefs to bear
207,COMMISSIONED.,"That all these ministries are o'er,"
208,COMMISSIONED.,"And thou, so happy, Love, elsewhere,"
209,COMMISSIONED.,Never can need me more:--
210,COMMISSIONED.,
211,COMMISSIONED.,And I can do for thee but this
212,COMMISSIONED.,"(Working on blindly, knowing not"

221,COMMISSIONED.,I am sent forth by her.
222,COMMISSIONED.,
223,COMMISSIONED.,Feeling the while how good it is
224,COMMISSIONED.,"To do thy errands thus, and think"
225,COMMISSIONED.,"It may be, in the blue, far space,"
226,COMMISSIONED.,"Thou watchest from the heaven's brink,--"
227,COMMISSIONED.,A smile upon my face.
228,COMMISSIONED.,
229,COMMISSIONED.,"And when the day's work ends with day,"
230,COMMISSIONED.,"And star-eyed evening, stealing in,"
231,COMMISSIONED.,"Waves a cool hand to flying noon,"
232,COMMISSIONED.,"And restless, surging thoughts begin,"
233,COMMISSIONED.,"Like sad bells out of tune,"
234,COMMISSIONED.,
235,COMMISSIONED.,"I'll pray: ""Dear Lord, to whose great love"
236,COMMISSIONED.,"Nor bound nor limit line is set,"
237,COMMISSIONED.,"Give to my darling, I implore,"
238,COMMISSIONED.,"Some new sweet joy not tasted yet,"
239,COMMISSIONED.,"For I can give no more."""
240,COMMISSIONED.,
241,COMMISSIONED.,And with the words my thoughts shall climb
242,COMMISSIONED.,With following feet the heavenly stair
243,COMMISSIONED.,"Up which thy steps so lately sped,"
244,COMMISSIONED.,"And, seeing thee so happy there,"
245,COMMISSIONED.,Come back half comforted.

261,THE CRADLE TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,

282,THE CRADLE TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,For wistful mother-eyes are blurred
283,THE CRADLE TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"With sudden mists, as lingerers stay,"

287,THE CRADLE TOMB IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.,"Soft, furtive hands caress the stone,"

2581,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Kintu, the god, appeared as man."
2582,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Clad in the plain white priestly dress,"
2583,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He journeyed through the wilderness,"
2584,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,His wife beside. A mild-faced cow
2585,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"They drove, and one low-bleating lamb;"
2586,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He bore a ripe banana-bough,"
2587,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And she a root of fruitful yam:
2588,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"This was their worldly worth and store,"
2589,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,But God can make the little more.
2590,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The glad earth knew his feet; her mould
2591,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Trembled with quickening thrills, and stirred."
2592,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Miraculous harvests spread and rolled,"
2593,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The orchards shone with ruddy gold;
2594,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The flocks increased, increased the herd,"
2595,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And a great nation spread and grew
2596,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"From the swift lineage of the two,"
2597,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Peopling the solitary place;
2598,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A fair and strong and fruitful race,"
2599,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Who knew not pain nor want nor grief,"
2600,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And Kintu reigned their lord and chief.
2601,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2602,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"So sped three centuries along,"
2603,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Till Kintu's sons waxed fierce and strong;
2604,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"They learned to war, they loved to slay;"
2605,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Cruel and dark grew all their faces;
2606,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Discordant death-cries scared the day,"
2607,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Blood stained the green and holy places;
2608,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And drunk with lust, with anger hot,"
2609,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,His sons mild Kintu heeded not.
2610,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"At last the god arose in wrath,"
2611,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"His sandals tied, and down the path,"
2612,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"His wife beside him, as of yore,"
2613,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He went. A cow, a single lamb"
2614,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,They took; one tuber of the yam;
2615,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,One yellow-podded branch they bore
2616,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Of ripe banana,--these, no more,"
2617,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Of all the heaped-up harvest store.
2618,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"They left the huts, they left the tent,"
2619,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Nor turned, nor cast a backward look:"
2620,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Behind, the thick boughs met and shook."
2621,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,They vanished. Long with wild lament
2622,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Mourned all the tribe, in vain, in vain;"
2623,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The gift once given was given no more,"
2624,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The grieved god came not again.
2625,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2626,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"To what far paradise they fared,"
2627,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"That heavenly pair, what wilderness"
2628,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Their gentle rule next owned and shared,"
2629,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Knoweth no man,--no man can guess."
2630,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"On secret roads, by pathways blind,"
2631,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The gods go forth, and none may find;"
2632,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,But sad the world where God is not!
2633,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"By man was Kintu soon forgot,"
2634,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Or named and held as legend dim,"
2635,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"But the wronged earth, remembering him,"
2636,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,By scanty fruit and tardy grain
2637,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And silent song revealed her pain.
2638,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"So centuries came, and centuries went,"
2639,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And heaped the graves and filled the tent.
2640,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Kings rose, and fought their royal way"
2641,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"To conquest over heaps of slain,"
2642,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And reigned a little. Then, one day,"
2643,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,They vanished into dust again.
2644,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And other kings usurped their place,"
2645,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Who called themselves of Kintu's race,"
2646,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And worshipped Kintu; not as he,"
2647,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The mild, benignant deity,"
2648,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Who held all life a holy thing,"
2649,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Be it of insect or of king,"
2650,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Would have ordained, but with wild rite,"
2651,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With altars heaped, and dolorous cries,"
2652,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And savage dance, and bale-fires light,"
2653,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,An unaccepted sacrifice.
2654,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"At last, when thousand years were flown,"
2655,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The great Ma-anda filled the throne:
2656,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A prince of generous heart and high,"
2657,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Impetuous, noble, fierce, and true;"
2658,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"His wrath like lightning hurtling by,"
2659,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,His pardon like the healing dew.
2660,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And chiefs and sages swore each one
2661,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,He was great Kintu's worthiest son.
2662,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2663,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"One night, in forests still and deep,"
2664,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A shepherd sat to watch his sheep,"
2665,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And started, as through darkness dim"
2666,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,A strange voice rang and calmed to him:
2667,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Wake! there are wonders waiting thee!"
2668,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Go where the thick mimosas be,"
2669,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Fringing a little open plain,"
2670,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Honor and power wouldest thou gain?
2671,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Go, foolish man, to fortune blind;"
2672,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Follow the stream, and thou shall find."""
2673,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Three several nights the voice was heard,"
2674,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Louder and more emphatic grown.
2675,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Then, at the thrice-repeated word,"
2676,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The shepherd rose and went alone,"
2677,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Threading the mazes of the stream
2678,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Like one who wanders in a dream.
2679,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Long miles he ran, the stream beside,"
2680,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Which this way, that way, turned and sped,"
2681,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And called and sang, a noisy guide."
2682,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,At last its vagrant dances led
2683,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,To where the thick mimosas' shade
2684,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Circled and fringed an open glade;
2685,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"There the wild streamlet danced away,"
2686,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The moon was shining strangely white,"
2687,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And by its fitful, gleaming ray"
2688,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The shepherd saw a wondrous sight;
2689,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"In the glade's midst, each on his mat,"
2690,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A group of armed warriors sat,"
2691,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"White-robed, majestic, with deep eyes"
2692,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Fixed on him with a stern surprise;
2693,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And in their midst an aged chief
2694,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Enthroned sat, whose beard, like foam,"
2695,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Caressed his mighty knees. As leaf
2696,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Shakes in the wind the shepherd shook,"
2697,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And veiled his eyes before that look,"
2698,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And prayed, and thought upon his home,"
2699,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Nor spoke, nor moved, till the old man,"
2700,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"In voice like waterfall, began:"
2701,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Shepherd, how names himself thy king?"""
2702,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Ma-anda,"" answered, shuddering,"
2703,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The shepherd. ""Good, thou speakest well."
2704,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And now, my son, I bid thee tell"
2705,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Thy first king's name."" ""It was Kintu."""
2706,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""'Tis rightly said, thou answerest true."
2707,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Hark! To Ma-anda, Kintu's son,"
2708,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Hasten, and bid him, fearing naught,"
2709,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Come hither, taking thee for guide;"
2710,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Thou and he, not another one,"
2711,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Not even a dog may run beside!
2712,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Long has Ma-anda Kintu sought
2713,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With spell and conjuration dim,"
2714,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Now Kintu has a word for him.
2715,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Go, do thy errand, haste thee hence,"
2716,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Kintu insures thy recompense."""
2717,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"All night the shepherd ran, star-led,"
2718,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"All the hot day he hastened straight,"
2719,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Nor stopped for sleep, nor stopped for bread,"
2720,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Until he reached the city gate,"
2721,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And saw red rays of evening fall
2722,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,On the leaf-hutted capital.
2723,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He sought the king, his tale he told."
2724,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Ma-anda faltered not, nor stayed."
2725,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He seized his spear, he left the tent:"
2726,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Shook off the brown arms of his queens,"
2727,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Who clasped his knees with wailing screams;
2728,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,On pain of instant death forbade
2729,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,That man should spy or follow him;
2730,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And down the pathway, arching dim,"
2731,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Fearless and light of heart and bold
2732,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Followed the shepherd where he went.
2733,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2734,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,But one there was who loved his king
2735,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Too well to suffer such strange thing,--"
2736,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The chieftain of the host was he,"
2737,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Next to the monarch in degree;
2738,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And, fearing wile or stratagem"
2739,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Menaced the king, he followed them"
2740,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,With noiseless tread and out of sight.
2741,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"So on they fared the forest through,"
2742,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"From evening shades to dawning light,"
2743,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"From damning to the dusk and dew,--"
2744,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The unseen follower and the two.
2745,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Ofttimes the king turned back to scan
2746,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The path, but never saw he man."
2747,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,At last the forest-guarded space
2748,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"They reached, where, ranged in order, sat,"
2749,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Each couched upon his braided mat,"
2750,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The white-robed warriors, face to face"
2751,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With their majestic chief. The king,"
2752,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Albeit unused to fear or awe,"
2753,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Bowed down in homage, wondering,"
2754,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And bent his eyes, as fearing to be"
2755,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Blinded by rays of deity.
2756,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Then asked the mighty voice and calm,"
2757,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Art thou Ma-anda called?"" ""I am."""
2758,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""And art thou king?"" ""The king am I,"""
2759,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The bold Ma-anda made reply.
2760,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Tis rightly spoken; but, my son,"
2761,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Why hast thou my command forgot,"
2762,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,That no man with thee to this spot
2763,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Should come, except thy guide alone?"""
2764,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""No man has come,"" Ma-anda said."
2765,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2766,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Alone we journeyed, he and I;"
2767,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And often have I turned my head,"
2768,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And never living thing could spy.
2769,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"None is there, on my faith as king."""
2770,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""A king's word is a weighty thing,"""
2771,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The old man answered. ""Let it be,--"
2772,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,But still a man HAS followed thee!
2773,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Now answer, Ma-anda, one more thing:"
2774,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Who, first of all thy line, was king?"""
2775,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Kintu the god."" ""'Tis well, my son,"
2776,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"All creatures Kintu loved,--not one"
2777,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Too pitiful or weak or small;
2778,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,He knew them and he loved them all;
2779,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And never did a living thing,"
2780,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Or bird in air or fish in lake,"
2781,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Endure a pang for Kintu's sake.
2782,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Then rose his sons, of differing mind,"
2783,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Who gorged on cruel feasts each day,"
2784,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And bathed in blood, and joyed to slay,"
2785,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And laughed at pain and suffering.
2786,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Then Kintu sadly went his way.
2787,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The gods long-suffering are and kind,"
2788,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Often they pardon, long they wait;"
2789,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"But men are evil, men are blind."
2790,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"After much tarriance, much debate,"
2791,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The good gods leave them to their fate;
2792,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,So Kintu went where none may find.
2793,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2794,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Each king in turn has sought since then,"
2795,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"From Chora down, the first in line,"
2796,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,To win lost Kintu back to men.
2797,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Vain was his search, and vain were thine,"
2798,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Save that the gods have special grace
2799,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"To thee, Ma-anda. Face to face"
2800,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With Kintu thou shall stand, and he"
2801,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Shall speak the word of power to thee;
2802,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Clasped to his bosom, thou shall share"
2803,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"His knowledge of the earth, the air,"
2804,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And deep things, secret things, shall learn."
2805,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"But stay,""--the old man's voice grew stern,--"
2806,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Before I further speak, declare"
2807,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Who is that man in ambush there!"""
2808,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""There is no man,--no man I see."""
2809,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Deny no longer, it is vain."
2810,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Within the shadow of the tree
2811,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He lurketh; lo, behold him plain!"""
2812,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And the king saw;--for at the word
2813,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"From covert stole the hidden spy,"
2814,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And sought his monarch's side. One cry,"
2815,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A lion's roar, Ma-anda gave,"
2816,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Then seized his spear, and poised and drave."
2817,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Like lightning bolt it hissed and whirred,"
2818,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,A flash across the midnight blue.
2819,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A single groan, a jet of red,"
2820,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And, pierced and stricken through and through,"
2821,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Upon the ground the chief fell dead;
2822,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"But still with love no death could chase,"
2823,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,His eyes sought out his master's face.
2824,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2825,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Blent with Ma-anda's a wild cry
2826,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Of many voices rose on high,"
2827,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,A shriek of anguish and despair.
2828,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Which shook and filled the startled air;
2829,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And when the king, his wrath still hot,"
2830,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Turned him, the little grassy plain"
2831,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,All lonely in the moonlight lay:
2832,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The chiefs had vanished all away
2833,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"As melted into thin, blue wind;"
2834,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Gone was the old man. Stunned and blind,"
2835,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,For a long moment stood the king;
2836,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"He tried to wake; he rubbed his eyes,"
2837,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,As though some fearful dream to end.
2838,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"It was no dream, this fearful thing:"
2839,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"There was the forest, there the skies,"
2840,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The shepherd--and his murdered friend.
2841,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With feverish haste, bewildered, mazed,"
2842,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"This way and that he vainly sped,"
2843,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Beating the air like one half crazed;
2844,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With prayers and cries unnumbered,"
2845,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Searching, imploring,--vain, all vain."
2846,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Only the echoing woods replied,"
2847,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With mocking booms their long aisles through,"
2848,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Come back, Kintu, Kintu, Kintu!"""
2849,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And pitiless to all his pain
2850,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The unanswering gods his suit denied.
2851,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"At last, as dawning slowly crept"
2852,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"To day, the king sank down and wept"
2853,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"A space; then, lifting as they could"
2854,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The lifeless burden, once a man,"
2855,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,He and the shepherd-guide began
2856,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Their grievous journey through the wood,"
2857,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"The long and hard and dreary way,"
2858,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Trodden so lightly yesterday;
2859,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And the third day, at evening's fall,"
2860,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Gained the leaf-hutted capital.
2861,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,There burial rites were duly paid:
2862,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,
2863,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Like bridegroom decked for banqueting,"
2864,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The chief adorned his funeral-pyre;
2865,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Rare gums and spices fed the fire,"
2866,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,Perfumes and every precious thing;
2867,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And songs were sung, and prayers were prayed,"
2868,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And priests danced jubilant all day.
2869,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"But prone the king Ma-anda lay,"
2870,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"With ashes on his royal crest,"
2871,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"And groaned, and beat upon his breast,"
2872,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,And called on Kintu loud and wild:
2873,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"""Father, come back, forgive thy child!"""
2874,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,"Bitter the cry, but vain, all vain;"
2875,THE LEGEND OF KINTU.,The grieved god came not again.
