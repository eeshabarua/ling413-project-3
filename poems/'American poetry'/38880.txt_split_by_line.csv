55,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"The inestimable value of literature in supplying healthful recreation,"
56,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"in opening the mind to larger views of life, and in creating ideals that"
57,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"shall mold the spiritual nature, is conceded now by every one who has"
58,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,intelligently considered the problems of education. But the basis upon
59,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,which literature shall be selected and arranged is still a matter of
60,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,discussion.
61,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
62,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Chronology, race-correspondence, correlation, and ethical training"
63,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,should all be recognized incidentally; but the main purpose of the
64,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,teacher of literature is to send children on into life with a genuine
65,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"love for good reading. To accomplish this, three things should be true"
66,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"of the reading offered: first, it should be _literature_; second, it"
67,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"should be literature of some scope, not merely some small phase of"
68,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"literature, such as the fables or the poetry of one of the less eminent"
69,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"poets; and third, it should appeal to children's natural interests."
70,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Children's interests, varied as they seem, center in the marvelous and"
71,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"the preternatural; in the natural world; and in human life, especially"
72,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,child life and the romantic and heroic aspects of mature life. In the
73,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"selections made for each grade, we have recognized these different"
74,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,interests.
75,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
76,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,To grade poetry perfectly for different ages is an impossibility; much
77,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,of the greatest verse is for all ages--that is one reason why it _is_
78,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,great. A child of five will lisp the numbers of Horatius with delight;
79,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"and Scott's _Lullaby of an Infant Chief_, with its romantic color and"
80,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"its exquisite human tenderness, is dear to childhood, to manhood, and to"
81,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,old age. But the Land of Song is a great undiscovered country to the
82,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,little child; by some road or other he must find his way into it; and
83,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,these volumes simply attempt to point out a path through which he may be
84,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,led into its happy fields.
85,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
86,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,Our earnest thanks are due to the following publishers for permission
87,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"to use copyrighted poems: to Houghton, Mifflin & Co. for poems by"
88,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Longfellow, Whittier, Emerson, Holmes, Lowell, Aldrich, Bayard Taylor,"
89,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"James T. Fields, Phoebe Cary, Lucy Larcom, Celia Thaxter, and Sarah Orne"
90,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,Jewett; to D. Appleton & Co. for a large number of Bryant's poems; to
91,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"Charles Scribner's Sons for two poems by Stevenson, from _Underwoods_,"
92,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,and _A Child's Garden of Verse_; to J. B. Lippincott & Co. for two poems
93,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,by Thomas Buchanan Read; and to Henry T. Coates & Co. for a poem by
94,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,Charles Fenno Hoffman.
95,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,
96,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"The present volume is intended for the fourth, fifth, and sixth school"
97,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"years, or lower grammar grades. It is the second of three books prepared"
98,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,for use in the grades below the high school. As no collection of this
99,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"size can supply as much poetry as may be used to advantage, and as many"
100,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"desirable poems by American writers have necessarily been omitted, we"
101,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,have noted at the end of this volume lists of poems which it would be
102,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,"well to add to the material given here, that our children may realize"
103,_COMPILERS' PREFACE._,the scope and beauty of the poetry of their own land.

1568,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The seabirds screamed as they wheeled around,"
1569,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And there was joyance in their sound.
1570,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1571,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The buoy of the Inchcape bell was seen
1572,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,A darker speck on the ocean green;
1573,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,"
1574,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.
1575,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1576,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"He felt the cheering power of spring,"
1577,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"It made him whistle, it made him sing;"
1578,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"His heart was mirthful to excess,"
1579,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,But the Rover's mirth was wickedness.
1580,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1581,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,His eye was on the Inchcape float;
1582,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Quoth he, ""My men, put out the boat,"
1583,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"And row me to the Inchcape Rock,"
1584,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"And I'll plague the priest of Aberbrothok."""
1585,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1586,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,"
1587,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And to the Inchcape Rock they go;
1588,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,"
1589,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.
1590,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1591,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Down sunk the bell, with a gurgling sound,"
1592,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The bubbles rose and burst around;
1593,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Quoth Sir Ralph, ""The next who comes to the Rock"
1594,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Won't bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok."""
1595,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1596,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away;
1597,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,He scoured the seas for many a day;
1598,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"And now grown rich with plunder's store,"
1599,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,He steers his course for Scotland's shore.
1600,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1601,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky,"
1602,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,They cannot see the sun on high;
1603,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The wind hath blown a gale all day,"
1604,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,At evening it hath died away.
1605,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1606,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,On the deck the Rover takes his stand;
1607,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,So dark it is they see no land.
1608,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Quoth Sir Ralph, ""It will be lighter soon,"
1609,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"For there is the dawn of the rising moon."""
1610,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1611,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"""Can'st hear,"" said one, ""the breakers roar?"
1612,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,For methinks we should be near the shore;
1613,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Now where we are I cannot tell,"
1614,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"But I wish I could hear the Inchcape bell."""
1615,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1616,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"They hear no sound, the swell is strong;"
1617,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,"
1618,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock;
1619,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Cried they, ""It is the Inchcape Rock!"""
1620,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1621,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair,"
1622,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,And curst himself in his despair;
1623,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"The waves rush in on every side,"
1624,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The ship is sinking beneath the tide.
1625,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,
1626,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,But even in his dying fear
1627,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,"One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,"
1628,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,A sound as if with the Inchcape bell
1629,THE INCHCAPE ROCK.,The fiends below were ringing his knell.

1649,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Rats!
1650,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"They fought the dogs and killed the cats,"

1654,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Split open the kegs of salted sprats,"
1655,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,"

1662,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1663,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,At last the people in a body
1664,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,To the town hall came flocking:
1665,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""'Tis clear,"" cried they, ""our Mayor's a noddy:"
1666,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And as for our Corporation--shocking
1667,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,To think we buy gowns lined with ermine
1668,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,For dolts that can't or won't determine
1669,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,What's best to rid us of our vermin!
1670,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"You hope, because you're old and obese,"
1671,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,To find in the furry civic robe ease!
1672,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Rouse up, Sirs! Give your brains a racking"
1673,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"To find the remedy we're lacking,"
1674,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"
1675,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,At this the Mayor and Corporation
1676,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Quaked with a mighty consternation.
1677,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1678,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,An hour they sat in council;
1679,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,At length the Mayor broke silence:
1680,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;"
1681,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,I wish I were a mile hence!
1682,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,It's easy to bid one rack one's brain--
1683,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"I'm sure my poor head aches again,"
1684,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"I've scratched it so, and all in vain."
1685,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Oh, for a trap, a trap, a trap!"""
1686,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Just as he said this, what should hap"
1687,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,At the chamber door but a gentle tap?
1688,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""Bless us,"" cried the Mayor, ""what's that?"
1689,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Anything like the sound of a rat
1690,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Makes my heart go pitapat!
1691,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1692,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""Come in!"" the Mayor cried, looking bigger;"
1693,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And in did come the strangest figure!
1694,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,His queer long coat from heel to head
1695,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Was half of yellow and half of red;
1696,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And he himself was tall and thin,"
1697,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,"
1698,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,"
1699,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"No tuft on cheek, nor beard on chin,"
1700,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,But lips where smiles went out and in--
1701,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,There was no guessing his kith and kin!
1702,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And nobody could enough admire
1703,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,The tall man and his quaint attire:
1704,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Quoth one, ""It's as my great-grandsire,"
1705,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Starting up at the trump of Doom's tone,"
1706,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Had walked this way from his painted tombstone!"""
1707,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1708,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,He advanced to the council table:
1709,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And, ""Please your honors,"" said he, ""I'm able,"
1710,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"By means of a secret charm, to draw"
1711,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"All creatures living beneath the sun,"
1712,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"That creep, or swim, or fly, or run,"
1713,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,After me so as you never saw!
1714,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And I chiefly use my charm
1715,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"On creatures that do people harm,"
1716,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"The mole, the toad, the newt, the viper;"
1717,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And people call me the Pied Piper."""
1718,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And here they noticed round his neck
1719,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
1720,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,To match with his coat of the selfsame check;
1721,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And at the scarf's end hung a pipe;
1722,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying,"
1723,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,As if impatient to be playing
1724,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Upon this pipe, as low it dangled"
1725,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Over his vesture so old fangled.
1726,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""Yet,"" said he, ""poor piper as I am,"
1727,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"In Tartary I freed the Cham,"
1728,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Last June, from his huge swarm of gnats;"
1729,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,I eased in Asia the Nizam
1730,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Of a monstrous brood of vampire bats:
1731,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And as for what your brain bewilders,"
1732,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,If I can rid your town of rats
1733,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Will you give me a thousand guilders?"""
1734,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""One? fifty thousand!"" was the exclamation"
1735,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
1736,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1737,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Into the street the Piper stept,"
1738,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Smiling first a little smile,"
1739,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,As if he knew what magic slept
1740,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,In his quiet pipe the while;
1741,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Then like a musical adept,"
1742,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
1743,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
1744,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Like a candle flame where salt is sprinkled;
1745,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe had uttered,"
1746,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,You heard as if an army muttered;
1747,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And the muttering grew into a grumbling;
1748,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
1749,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling--
1750,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"
1751,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,"
1752,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
1753,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
1754,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Curling tails, and pricking whiskers,"
1755,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Families by tens and dozens,"
1756,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives,--"
1757,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Followed the Piper for their lives.
1758,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"From street to street he piped, advancing,"
1759,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And step for step they followed, dancing,"
1760,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Until they came to the river Weser
1761,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Wherein all plunged and perished,"
1762,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Save one, who stout as Julius Cæsar,"
1763,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Swam across, and lived to carry"
1764,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,(As he the manuscript he cherished)
1765,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"To Rat-land home his commentary,"
1766,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Which was, ""At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
1767,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,"
1768,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And putting apples wondrous ripe
1769,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Into a cider press's gripe;
1770,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And a moving away of pickle-tub boards,"
1771,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And a leaving ajar of conserve cupboards,"
1772,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil flasks,"
1773,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And a breaking the hoops of butter casks;
1774,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And it seemed as if a voice
1775,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
1776,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Is breathed) called out, O rats, rejoice!"
1777,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
1778,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,"
1779,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Breakfast, dinner, supper, luncheon!"
1780,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And just as a bulky sugar puncheon,"
1781,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"All ready staved, like a great sun shone"
1782,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Glorious, scarce an inch before me,"
1783,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'"
1784,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"--I found the Weser rolling o'er me."""
1785,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1786,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,You should have heard the Hamelin people
1787,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple;
1788,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""Go,"" cried the Mayor, ""and get long poles!"
1789,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Poke out the nests, and block up the holes!"
1790,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Consult with carpenters and builders,"
1791,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And leave in town not even a trace
1792,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Of the rats!"" When suddenly up the face"
1793,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Of the Piper perked in the market place,"
1794,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"With a ""First, if you please, my thousand guilders!"""
1795,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1796,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue;
1797,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,So did the Corporation too.
1798,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,For council dinners made rare havoc
1799,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock;"
1800,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And half the money would replenish
1801,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.
1802,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,To pay this sum to a wandering fellow
1803,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,With a gypsy coat of red and yellow!
1804,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""Besides,"" quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,"
1805,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""Our business was done at the river's brink;"
1806,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,"
1807,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And what's dead can't come to life, I think."
1808,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink"
1809,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"From the duty of giving you something for drink,"
1810,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And a matter of money to put in your poke;
1811,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"But, as for the guilders, what we spoke"
1812,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Of them, as you very well know, was in joke--"
1813,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Beside, our losses have made us thrifty:"
1814,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!"""
1815,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1816,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"The Piper's face fell, and he cried,"
1817,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""No trifling! I can't wait; beside"
1818,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,I've promised to visit by dinner time
1819,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Bagdat, and accept the prime"
1820,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Of the head cook's pottage, all he's rich in,"
1821,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"For having left in the Caliph's kitchen,"
1822,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Of a nest of scorpions no survivor.
1823,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,With him I proved no bargain-driver;
1824,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver!"
1825,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And folks who put me in a passion
1826,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"May find me pipe to another fashion."""
1827,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""How?"" cried the Mayor, ""d'ye think I'll brook"
1828,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Being worse treated than a cook?
1829,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Insulted by a lazy ribald
1830,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,With idle pipe and vesture piebald?
1831,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst,"
1832,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Blow your pipe there till you burst!"""
1833,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1834,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Once more he stept into the street,"
1835,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And to his lips again
1836,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Laid his long pipe of smooth, straight cane;"
1837,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And ere he blew three notes (such sweet
1838,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
1839,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Never gave the enraptured air),"
1840,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling,"
1841,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,"
1842,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,"
1843,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Little hands clapping and little tongues chattering,"
1844,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering,"
1845,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Out came the children running:
1846,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"All the little boys and girls,"
1847,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,"
1848,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,"
1849,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after"
1850,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
1851,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,
1852,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood"
1853,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"As if they were changed into blocks of wood,"
1854,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Unable to move a step, or cry"
1855,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"To the children merrily skipping by,--"
1856,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And could only follow with the eye
1857,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.
1858,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And now the Mayor was on the rack,"
1859,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,"
1860,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,As the Piper turned from the High Street
1861,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,To where the Weser rolled its waters
1862,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
1863,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"However, he turned from south to west,"
1864,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,"
1865,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And after him the children pressed;
1866,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Great was the joy in every breast.
1867,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""He never can cross that mighty top!"
1868,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"He's forced to let the piping drop,"
1869,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And we shall see our children stop!"""
1870,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"When, lo! as they reached the mountain's side,"
1871,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
1872,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
1873,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And the Piper advanced, and the children followed;"
1874,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And when all were in to the very last,"
1875,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,The door in the mountain side shut fast.
1876,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Did I say, all? No! one was lame,"
1877,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And could not dance the whole of the way;
1878,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And in after years, if you would blame"
1879,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"His sadness, he was used to say,--"
1880,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"""It's dull in our town since my playmates left!"
1881,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,I can't forget that I'm bereft
1882,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Of all the pleasant sights they see,"
1883,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,Which the Piper also promised me:
1884,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,"
1885,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Joining the town and just at hand,"
1886,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew,"
1887,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And flowers put forth a fairer hue,"
1888,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And everything was strange and new;
1889,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,"
1890,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And their dogs outran our fallow deer,"
1891,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,"And honeybees had lost their stings,"
1892,THE PIED PIPER OF HAMELIN.,And horses were born with eagles' wings;

2394,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,In time brought forth to light.
2395,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,A gentleman of good account
2396,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"In Norfolk dwelt of late,"
2397,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Who did in honor far surmount

2405,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Each was to other kind;
2406,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"In love they lived, in love they died,"

2409,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The one, a fine and pretty boy,"

2463,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The parents being dead and gone,"
2464,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The children home he takes,"
2465,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And brings them straight unto his house,"
2466,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Where much of them he makes.
2467,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He had not kept these pretty babes
2468,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"A twelvemonth and a day,"
2469,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"But, for their wealth, he did devise"
2470,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,To make them both away.
2471,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2472,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He bargained with two ruffians strong
2473,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Which were of furious mood,"
2474,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,That they should take these children young
2475,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And slay them in a wood.
2476,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He told his wife an artful tale:
2477,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He would the children send
2478,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"To be brought up in fair London,"
2479,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,With one that was his friend.
2480,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2481,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Away then went those pretty babes,"
2482,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Rejoicing at that tide,"
2483,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Rejoicing with a merry mind,"
2484,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,They should on cockhorse ride.
2485,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"They prate and prattle pleasantly,"
2486,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"As they rode on the way,"
2487,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,To those that should their butchers be
2488,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And work their lives' decay.
2489,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2490,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"So that the pretty speech they had,"
2491,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Made murder's heart relent;
2492,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And they that undertook the deed
2493,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Full sore did now repent.
2494,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Yet one of them, more hard of heart,"
2495,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Did vow to do his charge,"
2496,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Because the wretch that hired him
2497,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Had paid him very large.
2498,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2499,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"The other won't agree thereto,"
2500,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,So here they fall to strife;
2501,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,With one another they did fight
2502,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,About the children's life:
2503,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And he that was of mildest mood,"
2504,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Did slay the other there,"
2505,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Within an unfrequented wood:
2506,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,The babes did quake for fear!
2507,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2508,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"He took the children by the hand,"
2509,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Tears standing in their eye,"
2510,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And bade them straightway follow him,"
2511,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And look they did not cry;
2512,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And two long miles he led them on,"
2513,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,While they for food complain:
2514,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"""Stay here,"" quoth he, ""I'll bring you bread,"
2515,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"When I come back again."""
2516,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2517,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"These pretty babes, with hand in hand,"
2518,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Went wandering up and down;
2519,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,But never more could see the man
2520,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Approaching from the town:
2521,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Their pretty lips with blackberries
2522,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Were all besmeared and dyed,"
2523,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And when they saw the darksome night,"
2524,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,They sat them down and cried.
2525,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2526,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Thus wandered these poor innocents
2527,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Till death did end their grief,"
2528,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"In one another's arms they died,"
2529,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,As wanting due relief.
2530,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,No burial this pretty pair
2531,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Of any man received,"
2532,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Till Robin Redbreast piously
2533,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Did cover them with leaves.
2534,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2535,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And now the heavy wrath of God
2536,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Upon their uncle fell;
2537,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,"
2538,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,His conscience felt an hell:
2539,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His barns were fired, his goods consumed,"
2540,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His lands were barren made,"
2541,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"His cattle died within the field,"
2542,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And nothing with him stayed.
2543,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2544,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And in the voyage to Portugal
2545,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Two of his sons did die;
2546,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And to conclude, himself was brought"
2547,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,To want and misery.
2548,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,He pawned and mortgaged all his land
2549,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Ere seven years came about.
2550,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And now at length this wicked act
2551,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Did by this means come out:
2552,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2553,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,The fellow that did take in hand
2554,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"These children for to kill,"
2555,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Was for a robbery judged to die,"
2556,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Such was God's blessèd will.
2557,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Who did confess the very truth,"
2558,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,As here hath been displayed:
2559,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Their uncle having died in gaol,"
2560,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Where he for debt was laid.
2561,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,
2562,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"You that executors be made,"
2563,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And overseers eke
2564,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Of children that be fatherless,"
2565,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,And infants mild and meek;
2566,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"Take you example by this thing,"
2567,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,"And yield to each his right,"
2568,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Lest God with such like misery
2569,THE CHILDREN IN THE WOOD.,Your wicked minds requite.

5927,WINSTANLEY.,"""And the heavier seas few look on nigh,"

5932,WINSTANLEY.,"""Oh, beacons sighted in the dark,"

5951,WINSTANLEY.,
5952,WINSTANLEY.,"The old Mayor looked him in the face,"

5967,WINSTANLEY.,Winstanley chose him men and gear;

5976,WINSTANLEY.,
5977,WINSTANLEY.,"Then he and the sea began their strife,"
5978,WINSTANLEY.,And worked with power and might;

6012,WINSTANLEY.,"With men and stores he put to sea,"
6013,WINSTANLEY.,As he was wont to do:

6015,WINSTANLEY.,A ghostly craft and crew.
6016,WINSTANLEY.,
6017,WINSTANLEY.,"And the sea fog lay and waxed alway,"

6021,WINSTANLEY.,
6022,WINSTANLEY.,They paced the Hoe in doubt and dread;
6023,WINSTANLEY.,"""Where may our mariners be?"""
6024,WINSTANLEY.,But the brooding fog lay soft as down

6026,WINSTANLEY.,
6027,WINSTANLEY.,"A Scottish schooner made the port,"

6037,WINSTANLEY.,"""And a stately house one instant showed,"

6041,WINSTANLEY.,
6042,WINSTANLEY.,"Then sighed the folk, ""The Lord be praised!"""
6043,WINSTANLEY.,And they flocked to the shore amain:

6046,WINSTANLEY.,
6047,WINSTANLEY.,"It ceased; and the red sun reared his head,"

6051,WINSTANLEY.,
6052,WINSTANLEY.,In fair weather with mirth and cheer
6053,WINSTANLEY.,The stately tower uprose;
6054,WINSTANLEY.,In foul weather with hunger and cold
6055,WINSTANLEY.,They were content to close;
6056,WINSTANLEY.,
6057,WINSTANLEY.,"Till up the stair Winstanley went,"
6058,WINSTANLEY.,To fire the wick afar;
6059,WINSTANLEY.,And Plymouth in the silent night
6060,WINSTANLEY.,Looked out and saw her star.
6061,WINSTANLEY.,
6062,WINSTANLEY.,Winstanley set his foot ashore;

6111,WINSTANLEY.,
6112,WINSTANLEY.,"The great mad waves were rolling graves,"
