67,YOUNG ADVENTURE,Foreword by Chauncey Brewster Tinker
68,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
69,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"In these days when the old civilisation is crumbling beneath our feet,"
70,YOUNG ADVENTURE,the thought of poetry crosses the mind like the dear memory of things
71,YOUNG ADVENTURE,that have long since passed away.  In our passionate desire for the new
72,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"era, it is difficult to refrain oneself from the commonplace practice of"
73,YOUNG ADVENTURE,speculating on the effects of warfare and of prophesying all manner of
74,YOUNG ADVENTURE,novel rebirths.  But it may be well for us to remember that the era
75,YOUNG ADVENTURE,which has recently closed was itself marked by a mad idealisation of all
76,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"novelties.  In the literary movements of the last decade --when, indeed,"
77,YOUNG ADVENTURE,any movement at all has been perceptible -- we have witnessed a
78,YOUNG ADVENTURE,bewildering rise and fall of methods and ideals.  We were captivated for
79,YOUNG ADVENTURE,a time by the quest of the golden phrase and the accompanying
80,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"cultivation of exotic emotions; and then, wearying of the pretty and the"
81,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"temperamental, we plunged into the bloodshot brutalities of naturalism."
82,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
83,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"From the smooth-flowing imitations of Tennyson and Swinburne, we passed"
84,YOUNG ADVENTURE,into a false freedom that had at its heart a repudiation of all law and
85,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"standards, for a parallel to which one turns instinctively to certain"
86,YOUNG ADVENTURE,recent developments in the political world.  We may hope that the eager
87,YOUNG ADVENTURE,search for novelty of form and subject may have its influence in
88,YOUNG ADVENTURE,releasing us from our old bondage to the commonplace and in broadening
89,YOUNG ADVENTURE,the scope of poetry; but we cannot blind ourselves to the fact that it
90,YOUNG ADVENTURE,has at the same time completed that estrangement between the poet and
91,YOUNG ADVENTURE,the general public which has been developing for half a century.  The
92,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"great mass of the reading world, to whom the arts should minister, have"
93,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"now forgotten that poetry is a consolation in times of doubt and peril,"
94,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"a beacon, and ""an ever-fixed mark"" in a crazed and shifting world.  Our"
95,YOUNG ADVENTURE,poetry --and I am speaking in particular of American poetry -- has been
96,YOUNG ADVENTURE,centrifugal; our poets have broken up into smaller and ever smaller
97,YOUNG ADVENTURE,groups. Individualism has triumphed.
98,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
99,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"To the general confusion, critics, if they may be said to have existed"
100,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"at all, have added by their paltry conception of the art. They have"
101,YOUNG ADVENTURE,deemed it a sufficient denunciation of a poet to accuse him of imitating
102,YOUNG ADVENTURE,his masters; as though the history of an art were rather a series of
103,YOUNG ADVENTURE,violent rebellions than a growth and a progressive illumination. Not all
104,YOUNG ADVENTURE,generations are privileged to see the working of a great creative
105,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"impulse, but the want, keen though it be, furnishes no reason for the"
106,YOUNG ADVENTURE,utter rejection of
107,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
108,YOUNG ADVENTURE,A tremulous murmur from great days long dead.
109,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
110,YOUNG ADVENTURE,But this fear of echoing the past may work us a yet greater misfortune.
111,YOUNG ADVENTURE,In the rejection of the manner of an earlier epoch may be implicit also
112,YOUNG ADVENTURE,the rejection of the very sources from which springs the life of the
113,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"fair art.  Melody, and a love of the green earth, and a yearning for God"
114,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"are of the very fabric of poetry, deny it who will. The Muses still"
115,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"reign on Parnassus, wax the heathen never so furious. Poets who love"
116,YOUNG ADVENTURE,poetry better than their own fame in Grub Street will do well to
117,YOUNG ADVENTURE,remember
118,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
119,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"The flame, the noble pageant of our life;"
120,YOUNG ADVENTURE,The burning seal that stamps man's high indenture
121,YOUNG ADVENTURE,To vain attempt and most forlorn adventure;
122,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"Romance and purple seas, and toppling towns,"
123,YOUNG ADVENTURE,And the wind's valiance crying o'er the downs.
124,YOUNG ADVENTURE,
125,YOUNG ADVENTURE,It is a poor business to find in such words only the illusions of youth
126,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"and a new enthusiasm.  The desire for novelty, the passion for force and"
127,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"dirt, and the hankering after freakishness of mood, which many have"
128,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"attempted to substitute for the older and simpler things, are themselves"
129,YOUNG ADVENTURE,the best evidence of disillusion and jaded nerves.  There is a weariness
130,YOUNG ADVENTURE,and a disgust in our recent impatience with beauty which indicate too
131,YOUNG ADVENTURE,clearly the exhaustion of our spiritual resources.  It may well be that
132,YOUNG ADVENTURE,the rebirth of poetry is to be manifest in a reappearance of the
133,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"obvious, --in a love of the sea and of the beauty of clouds, in the"
134,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"adventure of death and the yet more amazing adventure of living, in a"
135,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"vital love of colour, whether of the Orient or the drug-shop, in"
136,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"childlike love of melody, and the cool cleansing of rain, in strange"
137,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"faces and old memories. This, in the past, has been poetry, and this"
138,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"will be poetry again. The singer who, out of a full heart, can offer to"
139,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"the world his vision of its beauty, and out of a noble mind, his"
140,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"conception of its destiny, will bestow upon his time the most precious"
141,YOUNG ADVENTURE,"gift which we can now receive, the gift of his healing power."

215,II.,"Johnny, mooning around as usual!  He will never make his"
216,II.,"way."""
217,II.,"--Letter of George Keats, 18--"
218,II.,
219,II.,
220,II.,
221,II.,"Night falls; the great jars glow against the dark,"
222,II.,"Dark green, dusk red, and, like a coiling snake,"
223,II.,"Writhing eternally in smoky gyres,"
224,II.,Great ropes of gorgeous vapor twist and turn
225,II.,Within them.  So the Eastern fisherman
226,II.,"Saw the swart genie rise when the lead seal,"
227,II.,"Scribbled with charms, was lifted from the jar;"
228,II.,"And -- well, how went the tale?  Like this, like this?..."
229,II.,
230,II.,"No herbage broke the barren flats of land,"
231,II.,"No winds dared loiter within smiling trees,"
232,II.,"Nor were there any brooks on either hand,"
233,II.,"Only the dry, bright sand,"
234,II.,"Naked and golden, lay before the seas."
235,II.,
236,II.,"One boat toiled noiselessly along the deep,"
237,II.,The thirsty ripples dying silently
238,II.,"Upon its track.  Far out the brown nets sweep,"
239,II.,And night begins to creep
240,II.,Across the intolerable mirror of the sea.
241,II.,
242,II.,"Twice the nets rise, a-trail with sea-plants brown,"
243,II.,"Distorted shells, and rocks green-mossed with slime,"
244,II.,"Nought else.  The fisher, sick at heart, kneels down;"
245,II.,"""Prayer may appease God's frown,"""
246,II.,"He thinks, then, kneeling, casts for the third time."
247,II.,
248,II.,"And lo! an earthen jar, bound round with brass,"
249,II.,Lies tangled in the cordage of his net.
250,II.,"About the bright waves gleam like shattered glass,"
251,II.,And where the sea's rim was
252,II.,"The sun dips, flat and red, about to set."
253,II.,
254,II.,The prow grates on the beach.  The fisherman
255,II.,"Stoops, tearing at the cords that bind the seal."
256,II.,"Shall pearls roll out, lustrous and white and wan?"
257,II.,Lapis? carnelian?
258,II.,Unheard-of stones that make the sick mind reel
259,II.,
260,II.,"With wonder of their beauty?  Rubies, then?"
261,II.,"Green emeralds, glittering like the eyes of beasts?"
262,II.,"Poisonous opals, good to madden men?"
263,II.,"Gold bezants, ten and ten?"
264,II.,"Hard, regal diamonds, like kingly feasts?"
265,II.,
266,II.,He tugged; the seal gave way.  A little smoke
267,II.,Curled like a feather in the darkening sky.
268,II.,"A blinding gush of fire burst, flamed, and broke."
269,II.,A voice like a wind spoke.
270,II.,"Armored with light, and turbaned terribly,"
271,II.,
272,II.,A genie tramped the round earth underfoot;
273,II.,"His head sought out the stars, his cupped right hand"
274,II.,Made half the sky one darkness.  He was mute.
275,II.,"The sun, a ripened fruit,"
276,II.,Drooped lower.  Scarlet eddied o'er the sand.
277,II.,
278,II.,"The genie spoke:  ""O miserable one!"
279,II.,"Thy prize awaits thee; come, and hug it close!"
280,II.,A noble crown thy draggled nets have won
281,II.,For this that thou hast done.
282,II.,"Blessed are fools!  A gift remains for those!"""
283,II.,
284,II.,"His hand sought out his sword, and lightnings flared"
285,II.,Across the sky in one great bloom of fire.
286,II.,"Poised like a toppling mountain, it hung bared;"
287,II.,Suns that were jewels glared
288,II.,Along its hilt.  The air burnt like a pyre.
289,II.,
290,II.,"Once more the genie spoke:  ""Something I owe"
291,II.,"To thee, thou fool, thou fool.  Come, canst thou sing?"
292,II.,"Yea?  Sing then; if thy song be brave, then go"
293,II.,Free and released -- or no!
294,II.,"Find first some task, some overmastering thing"
295,II.,"I cannot do, and find it speedily,"
296,II.,"For if thou dost not thou shalt surely die!"""
297,II.,
298,II.,"The sword whirled back.  The fisherman uprose,"
299,II.,And if at first his voice was weak with fear
300,II.,"And his limbs trembled, it was but a doze,"
301,II.,And at the high song's close
302,II.,He stood up straight.  His voice rang loud and clear.
303,II.,
304,II.,
305,II.,The Song.
306,II.,
307,II.,Last night the quays were lighted;
308,II.,Cressets of smoking pine
309,II.,Glared o'er the roaring mariners
310,II.,That drink the yellow wine.
311,II.,
312,II.,"Their song rolled to the rafters,"
313,II.,"It struck the high stars pale,"
314,II.,"Such worth was in their discourse,"
315,II.,Such wonder in their tale.
316,II.,
317,II.,"Blue borage filled the clinking cups,"
318,II.,"The murky night grew wan,"
319,II.,"Till one rose, crowned with laurel-leaves,"
320,II.,That was an outland man.
321,II.,
322,II.,"""Come, let us drink to war!"" said he,"
323,II.,"""The torch of the sacked town!"
324,II.,"The swan's-bath and the wolf-ships,"
325,II.,And Harald of renown!
326,II.,
327,II.,"""Yea, while the milk was on his lips,"
328,II.,"Before the day was born,"
329,II.,He took the Almayne Kaiser's head
330,II.,To be his drinking-horn!
331,II.,
332,II.,"""Yea, while the down was on his chin,"
333,II.,"Or yet his beard was grown,"
334,II.,"He broke the gates of Micklegarth,"
335,II.,And stole the lion-throne!
336,II.,
337,II.,"""Drink to Harald, king of the world,"
338,II.,Lord of the tongue and the troth!
339,II.,"To the bellowing horns of Ostfriesland,"
340,II.,"And the trumpets of the Goth!"""
341,II.,
342,II.,"Their shouts rolled to the rafters,"
343,II.,"The drink-horns crashed and rang,"
344,II.,"And all their talk was a clangor of war,"
345,II.,As swords together sang!
346,II.,
347,II.,"_But dimly, through the deep night,"
348,II.,"Where stars like flowers shone,"
349,II.,A passionate shape came gliding --
350,II.,I saw one thing alone.
351,II.,
352,II.,I only saw my young love
353,II.,"Shining against the dark,"
354,II.,"The whiteness of her raiment,"
355,II.,The head that bent to hark.
356,II.,
357,II.,"I only saw my young love,"
358,II.,Like flowers in the sun --
359,II.,"Her hands like waxen petals,"
360,II.,Where yawning poppies run.
361,II.,
362,II.,"I only felt there, chrysmal,"
363,II.,"Against my cheek her breath,"
364,II.,"Though all the winds were baying,"
365,II.,And the sky bright with Death._
366,II.,
367,II.,"Red sparks whirled up the chimney,"
368,II.,"A hungry flaught of flame,"
369,II.,And a lean man from Greece arose;
370,II.,Thrasyllos was his name.
371,II.,
372,II.,"""I praise all noble wines!"" he cried,"
373,II.,"""Green robes of tissue fine,"
374,II.,"Peacocks and apes and ivory,"
375,II.,"And Homer's sea-loud line,"
376,II.,
377,II.,"""Statues and rings and carven gems,"
378,II.,And the wise crawling sea;
379,II.,"But most of all the crowns of kings,"
380,II.,The rule they wield thereby!
381,II.,
382,II.,"""Power, fired power, blank and bright!"
383,II.,A fit hilt for the hand!
384,II.,"The one good sword for a freeman,"
385,II.,"While yet the cold stars stand!"""
386,II.,
387,II.,"Their shouts rolled to the rafters,"
388,II.,The air was thick with wine.
389,II.,"_I only knew her deep eyes,"
390,II.,And felt her hand in mine.
391,II.,
392,II.,"Softly as quiet water,"
393,II.,One finger touched my cheek;
394,II.,Her face like gracious moonlight --
395,II.,I might not move nor speak.
396,II.,
397,II.,"I only saw that beauty,"
398,II.,I only felt that form
399,II.,"There, in the silken darkness --"
400,II.,God wot my heart was warm!_
401,II.,
402,II.,"Their shouts rolled to the rafters,"
403,II.,Another chief began;
404,II.,His slit lips showed him for a Hun;
405,II.,He was an evil man.
406,II.,
407,II.,"""Sing to the joys of women!"" he yelled,"
408,II.,"""The hot delicious tents,"
409,II.,"The soft couch, and the white limbs;"
410,II.,"The air a steam of scents!"""
411,II.,
412,II.,"His eyes gleamed, and he wet his lips,"
413,II.,"The rafters shook with cheers,"
414,II.,"As he sang of woman, who is man's slave"
415,II.,For all unhonored years.
416,II.,
417,II.,"""Whether the wanton laughs amain,"
418,II.,"With one white shoulder bare,"
419,II.,Or in a sacked room you unbind
420,II.,Some crouching maiden's hair;
421,II.,
422,II.,"""This is the only good for man,"
423,II.,Like spices of the South --
424,II.,To see the glimmering body laid
425,II.,As pasture to his mouth!
426,II.,
427,II.,"""To leave no lees within the cup,"
428,II.,To see and take and rend;
429,II.,"To lap a girl's limbs up like wine,"
430,II.,"And laugh, knowing the end!"""
431,II.,
432,II.,"_Only, like low, still breathing,"
433,II.,"I heard one voice, one word;"
434,II.,"And hot speech poured upon my lips,"
435,II.,As my hands held a sword._
436,II.,
437,II.,"""Fools, thrice fools of lust!"" I cried,"
438,II.,"""Your eyes are blind to see"
439,II.,"Eternal beauty, moving far,"
440,II.,More glorious than horns of war!
441,II.,"But though my eyes were one blind scar,"
442,II.,That sight is shown to me!
443,II.,
444,II.,"""You nuzzle at the ivory side,"
445,II.,You clasp the golden head;
446,II.,"Fools, fools, who chatter and sing,"
447,II.,"You have taken the sign of a terrible thing,"
448,II.,"You have drunk down God with your beeswing,"
449,II.,And broken the saints for bread!
450,II.,
451,II.,"""For God moves darkly,"
452,II.,In silence and in storm;
453,II.,But in the body of woman
454,II.,He shows one burning form.
455,II.,
456,II.,"""For God moves blindly,"
457,II.,In darkness and in dread;
458,II.,But in the body of woman
459,II.,He raises up the dead.
460,II.,
461,II.,"""Gracile and straight as birches,"
462,II.,"Swift as the questing birds,"
463,II.,"They fill true-lovers' drink-horns up,"
464,II.,"Who speak not, having no words."
465,II.,
466,II.,"""Love is not delicate toying,"
467,II.,A slim and shimmering mesh;
468,II.,"It is two souls wrenched into one,"
469,II.,Two bodies made one flesh.
470,II.,
471,II.,"""Lust is a sprightly servant,"
472,II.,Gallant where wines are poured;
473,II.,"Love is a bitter master,"
474,II.,Love is an iron lord.
475,II.,
476,II.,"""Satin ease of the body,"
477,II.,"Fattened sloth of the hands,"
478,II.,"These and their like he will not send,"
479,II.,Only immortal fires to rend --
480,II.,"And the world's end is your journey's end,"
481,II.,And your stream chokes in the sands.
482,II.,
483,II.,"""Pleached calms shall not await you,"
484,II.,Peace you shall never find;
485,II.,Nought but the living moorland
486,II.,Scourged naked by the wind.
487,II.,
488,II.,"""Nought but the living moorland,"
489,II.,And your love's hand in yours;
490,II.,"The strength more sure than surety,"
491,II.,The mercy that endures.
492,II.,
493,II.,"""Then, though they give you to be burned,"
494,II.,"And slay you like a stoat,"
495,II.,"You have found the world's heart in the turn of a cheek,"
496,II.,Heaven in the lift of a throat.
497,II.,
498,II.,"""Although they break you on the wheel,"
499,II.,"That stood so straight in the sun,"
500,II.,"Behind you the trumpets split the sky,"
501,II.,Where the lost and furious fight goes by --
502,II.,"And God, our God, will have victory"
503,II.,"When the red day is done!"""
504,II.,
505,II.,"Their mirth rolled to the rafters,"
506,II.,They bellowed lechery;
507,II.,Light as a drifting feather
508,II.,My love slipped from my knee.
509,II.,
510,II.,"Within, the lights were yellow"
511,II.,In drowsy rooms and warm;
512,II.,"Without, the stabbing lightning"
513,II.,Shattered across the storm.
514,II.,
515,II.,"Within, the great logs crackled,"
516,II.,The drink-horns emptied soon;
517,II.,"Without, the black cloaks of the clouds"
518,II.,Strangled the waning moon.
519,II.,
520,II.,My love crossed o'er the threshold --
521,II.,God! but the night was murk!
522,II.,"I set myself against the cold,"
523,II.,And left them to their work.
524,II.,
525,II.,Their shouts rolled to the rafters;
526,II.,"A bitterer way was mine,"
527,II.,"And I left them in the tavern,"
528,II.,Drinking the yellow wine!
529,II.,
530,II.,"The last faint echoes rang along the plains,"
531,II.,"Died, and were gone.  The genie spoke:  ""Thy song"
532,II.,Serves well enough -- but yet thy task remains;
533,II.,Many and rending pains
534,II.,"Shall torture him who dares delay too long!"""
535,II.,
536,II.,His brown face hardened to a leaden mask.
537,II.,A bitter brine crusted the fisher's cheek --
538,II.,"""Almighty God, one thing alone I ask,"
539,II.,"Show me a task, a task!"""
540,II.,"The hard cup of the sky shone, gemmed and bleak."
541,II.,
542,II.,"""O love, whom I have sought by devious ways;"
543,II.,"O hidden beauty, naked as a star;"
544,II.,"You whose bright hair has burned across my days,"
545,II.,Making them lamps of praise;
546,II.,"O dawn-wind, breathing of Arabia!"
547,II.,
548,II.,"""You have I served.  Now fire has parched the vine,"
549,II.,And Death is on the singers and the song.
550,II.,"No longer are there lips to cling to mine,"
551,II.,"And the heart wearies of wine,"
552,II.,"And I am sick, for my desire is long."
553,II.,
554,II.,"""O love, soft-moving, delicate and tender!"
555,II.,"In her gold house the pipe calls querulously,"
556,II.,"They cloud with thin green silks her body slender,"
557,II.,They talk to her and tend her;
558,II.,"Come, piteous, gentle love, and set me free!"""
559,II.,
560,II.,"He ceased -- and, slowly rising o'er the deep,"
561,II.,"A faint song chimed, grew clearer, till at last"
562,II.,A golden horn of light began to creep
563,II.,"Where the dumb ripples sweep,"
564,II.,Making the sea one splendor where it passed.
565,II.,
566,II.,"A golden boat!  The bright oars rested soon,"
567,II.,And the prow met the sand.  The purple veils
568,II.,Misting the cabin fell.  Fair as the moon
569,II.,"When the morning comes too soon,"
570,II.,"And all the air is silver in the dales,"
571,II.,
572,II.,A gold-robed princess stepped upon the beach.
573,II.,"The fisher knelt and kissed her garment's hem,"
574,II.,"And then her lips, and strove at last for speech."
575,II.,The waters lapped the reach.
576,II.,"""Here thy strength breaks, thy might is nought to stem!"""
577,II.,
578,II.,He cried at last.  Speech shook him like a flame:
579,II.,"""Yea, though thou plucked the stars from out the sky,"
580,II.,Each lovely one would be a withered shame --
581,II.,Each thou couldst find or name --
582,II.,"To this fire-hearted beauty!""  Wearily"
583,II.,
584,II.,The genie heard.  A slow smile came like dawn
585,II.,"Over his face.  ""Thy task is done!"" he said."
586,II.,"A whirlwind roared, smoke shattered, he was gone;"
587,II.,"And, like a sudden horn,"
588,II.,"The moon shone clear, no longer smoked and red."
589,II.,
590,II.,They passed into the boat.  The gold oars beat
591,II.,"Loudly, then fainter, fainter, till at last"
592,II.,Only the quiet waters barely moved
593,II.,Along the whispering sand -- till all the vast
594,II.,"Expanse of sea began to shake with heat,"
595,II.,"And morning brought soft airs, by sailors loved."
596,II.,
597,II.,And after?...  Well...
598,II.,The shop-bell clangs!  Who comes?
599,II.,Quinine -- I pour the little bitter grains
600,II.,"Out upon blue, glazed squares of paper.  So."
601,II.,"And all the dusk I shall sit here alone,"
602,II.,"With many powers in my hands -- ah, see"
603,II.,How the blurred labels run on the old jars!
604,II.,"Opium -- and a cruel and sleepy scent,"
605,II.,The harsh taste of white poppies; India --
606,II.,"The writhing woods a-crawl with monstrous life,"
607,II.,"Save where the deodars are set like spears,"
608,II.,And a calm pool is mirrored ebony;
609,II.,Opium -- brown and warm and slender-breasted
610,II.,"She rises, shaking off the cool black water,"
611,II.,"And twisting up her hair, that ripples down,"
612,II.,"A torrent of black water, to her feet;"
613,II.,How the drops sparkle in the moonlight!  Once
614,II.,"I made a rhyme about it, singing softly:"
615,II.,
616,II.,Over Damascus every star
617,II.,"Keeps his unchanging course and cold,"
618,II.,"The dark weighs like an iron bar,"
619,II.,"The intense and pallid night is old,"
620,II.,Dim the moon's scimitar.
621,II.,
622,II.,"Still the lamps blaze within those halls,"
623,II.,Where poppies heap the marble vats
624,II.,For girls to tread; the thick air palls;
625,II.,And shadows hang like evil bats
626,II.,About the scented walls.
627,II.,
628,II.,"The girls are many, and they sing;"
629,II.,"Their white feet fall like flakes of snow,"
630,II.,Making a ceaseless murmuring --
631,II.,"Whispers of love, dead long ago,"
632,II.,"And dear, forgotten Spring."
633,II.,
634,II.,One alone sings not.  Tiredly
635,II.,"She sees the white blooms crushed, and smells"
636,II.,"The heavy scent.  They chatter:  ""See!"
637,II.,White Zira thinks of nothing else
638,II.,But the morn's jollity --
639,II.,
640,II.,"""Then Haroun takes her!""  But she dreams,"
641,II.,"Unhearing, of a certain field"
642,II.,"Of poppies, cut by many streams,"
643,II.,"Like lines across a round Turk shield,"
644,II.,Where now the hot sun gleams.
645,II.,
646,II.,"The field whereon they walked that day,"
647,II.,"And splendor filled her body up,"
648,II.,"And his; and then the trampled clay,"
649,II.,And slow smoke climbing the sky's cup
650,II.,From where the village lay.
651,II.,
652,II.,"And after -- much ache of the wrists,"
653,II.,"Where the cords irked her -- till she came,"
654,II.,"The price of many amethysts,"
655,II.,Hither.  And now the ultimate shame
656,II.,Blew trumpet in the lists.
657,II.,
658,II.,"And so she trod the poppies there,"
659,II.,"Remembering other poppies, too,"
660,II.,And did not seem to see or care.
661,II.,"Without, the first gray drops of dew"
662,II.,Sweetened the trembling air.
663,II.,
664,II.,She trod the poppies.  Hours passed
665,II.,Until she slept at length -- and Time
666,II.,Dragged his slow sickle.  When at last
667,II.,"She woke, the moon shone, bright as rime,"
668,II.,And night's tide rolled on fast.
669,II.,
670,II.,"She moaned once, knowing everything;"
671,II.,"Then, bitterer than death, she found"
672,II.,"The soft handmaidens, in a ring,"
673,II.,"Come to anoint her, all around,"
674,II.,That she might please the king.
675,II.,
676,II.,"Opium -- and the odor dies away,"
677,II.,Leaving the air yet heavy -- cassia -- myrrh --
678,II.,"Bitter and splendid.  See, the poisons come,"
679,II.,"Trooping in squat green vials, blazoned red"
680,II.,"With grinning skulls:  strychnine, a pallid dust"
681,II.,"Of tiny grains, like bones ground fine; and next"
682,II.,"The muddy green of arsenic, all livid,"
683,II.,Likest the face of one long dead -- they creep
684,II.,"Along the dusty shelf like deadly beetles,"
685,II.,"Whose fangs are carved with runnels, that the blood"
686,II.,May run down easily to the blind mouth
687,II.,"That snaps and gapes; and high above them there,"
688,II.,"My master's pride, a cobwebbed, yellow pot"
689,II.,Of honey from Mount Hybla.  Do the bees
690,II.,"Still moan among the low sweet purple clover,"
691,II.,"Endlessly many?  Still in deep-hushed woods,"
692,II.,When the incredible silver of the moon
693,II.,"Comes like a living wind through sleep-bowed branches,"
694,II.,"Still steal dark shapes from the enchanted glens,"
695,II.,"Which yet are purple with high dreams, and still"
696,II.,Fronting that quiet and eternal shield
697,II.,"Which is much more than Peace, does there still stand"
698,II.,"One sharp black shadow -- and the short, smooth horns"
699,II.,Are clear against that disk?
700,II.,O great Diana!
701,II.,"I, I have praised thee, yet I do not know"
702,II.,"What moves my mind so strangely, save that once"
703,II.,"I lay all night upon a thymy hill,"
704,II.,And watched the slow clouds pass like heaped-up foam
705,II.,"Across blue marble, till at last no speck"
706,II.,"Blotted the clear expanse, and the full moon"
707,II.,"Rose in much light, and all night long I saw"
708,II.,"Her ordered progress, till, in midmost heaven,"
709,II.,"There came a terrible silence, and the mice"
710,II.,"Crept to their holes, the crickets did not chirp,"
711,II.,All the small night-sounds stopped -- and clear pure light
712,II.,"Rippled like silk over the universe,"
713,II.,"Most cold and bleak; and yet my heart beat fast,"
714,II.,Waiting until the stillness broke.  I know not
715,II.,For what I waited -- something very great --
716,II.,I dared not look up to the sky for fear
717,II.,A brittle crackling should clash suddenly
718,II.,"Against the quiet, and a black line creep"
719,II.,"Across the sky, and widen like a mouth,"
720,II.,"Until the broken heavens streamed apart,"
721,II.,"Like torn lost banners, and the immortal fires,"
722,II.,"Roaring like lions, asked their meat from God."
723,II.,"I lay there, a black blot upon a shield"
724,II.,"Of quivering, watery whiteness.  The hush held"
725,II.,"Until I staggered up and cried aloud,"
726,II.,And then it seemed that something far too great
727,II.,"For knowledge, and illimitable as God,"
728,II.,"Rent the dark sky like lightning, and I fell,"
729,II.,"And, falling, heard a wild and rushing wind"
730,II.,"Of music, and saw lights that blinded me"
731,II.,"With white, impenetrable swords, and felt"
732,II.,"A pressure of soft hands upon my lips,"
733,II.,Upon my eyelids -- and since then I cough
734,II.,"At times, and have strange thoughts about the stars,"
735,II.,That some day -- some day --
736,II.,"Come, I must be quick!"
737,II.,My master will be back soon.  Let me light
738,II.,"Thin blue Arabian pastilles, and sit"
739,II.,"Like a dead god incensed by chanting priests,"
740,II.,"And watch the pungent smoke wreathe up and up,"
741,II.,Until he comes -- though he may rage because
742,II.,They cost good money.  Then I shall walk home
743,II.,Over the moor.  Already the moon climbs
744,II.,Above the world's edge.  By the time he comes
745,II.,She will be fully risen. --  There's his step!

805,II.,Filling the waves with colored fire
806,II.,Till each seemed like a jewelled spire
807,II.,Thrust up from some drowned city.  Soon
808,II.,From peak and cliff and minaret
809,II.,"The city's lights began to wink,"
810,II.,Each like a friendly word.  The moon
811,II.,"Began to broaden out her shield,"
812,II.,Spurting with silver.  Straight before
813,II.,The brown hills lay like quiet beasts
814,II.,"Stretched out beside a well-loved door,"
815,II.,And filling earth and sky and field
816,II.,With the calm heaving of their breasts.

822,II.,Their welcome like the hills stood fast:
823,II.,"And I, I had come home at last."
824,II.,
825,II.,So I laughed out with them aloud
826,II.,"To think that now the sun was broad,"
827,II.,"And climbing up the iron sky,"
828,II.,Where the raw streets stretched sullenly
829,II.,"About another room I knew,"
830,II.,"In a mean house -- and soon there, too,"
831,II.,The smith would burst the flimsy door
832,II.,And find me lying on the floor.

847,II.,"So, waiting for my wings to grow,"

849,II.,"Rising and falling, soft and swift,"

887,II.,"Once more knew eves of perfume, days ablaze"
888,II.,"With clear, dry heat on the brown, rolling fields;"

890,II.,Over a book of knights and bloody shields...
891,II.,"The ship slowed, jarred and stopped.  There, straight ahead,"
892,II.,"Were dock and fellows.  Stumbling, he was whirled"
893,II.,Out and away to meet them -- and his back
894,II.,"Slumped to the old half-cringe, his hands fell slack;"
895,II.,A big boy's arm went round him -- and a twist

941,II.,"Air foul with wine; a shouting, reeling crowd"

953,II.,Like great light

956,II.,"His friends were fools....  He was not fit to touch,"

962,II.,Others might do it... but he didn't care

964,II.,Suddenly his vision cleared.
965,II.,And something seemed to grow within his mind....
966,II.,Something was wrong -- the color of the wall --
967,II.,The queer shape of the bedposts -- everything
968,II.,"Was changed, somehow... his room.  Was this his room?"
969,II.,
970,II.,... He turned his head -- and saw beside him there
971,II.,"The sagging body's slope, the paint-smeared face,"
972,II.,"And the loose, open mouth, lax and awry,"
973,II.,"The breasts, the bleached and brittle hair... these things."

975,II.,"Of lightning for a moment.  Then he sank,"
976,II.,Prone beneath an intolerable weight.
977,II.,And bitter loathing crept up all his limbs.

990,II.,"Writhing like streams, like twisted charms"
991,II.,Of hot lead flung in snow.  Below
992,II.,"The iron ice stung like a goad,"
993,II.,"Slashing the torn shoes from my feet,"
994,II.,And all the air was bitter sleet.
995,II.,
996,II.,"And all the land was cramped with snow,"
997,II.,"Steel-strong and fierce and glimmering wan,"
998,II.,Like pale plains of obsidian.
999,II.,-- And yet I strove -- and I was fire
1000,II.,And ice -- and fire and ice were one
1001,II.,In one vast hunger of desire.
1002,II.,"A dim desire, of pleasant places,"
1003,II.,"And lush fields in the summer sun,"
1004,II.,"And logs aflame, and walls, and faces,"
1005,II.,"-- And wine, and old ambrosial talk,"

1010,II.,"Etched in unutterable pain,"

1013,II.,"In agony, in agony,"
1014,II.,And horribly a part of me....
1015,II.,"For Lethe is for no man set,"
1016,II.,And in Hell may no man forget.)
1017,II.,
1018,II.,"And there were flowers, and jugs, bright-glancing,"

1020,II.,"A moment's glance of fire, of fire,"
1021,II.,"Spiring, leaping, flaming higher,"

1023,II.,"Until two souls were one, and flame,"

1025,II.,As if all springs were crushed anew
1026,II.,Into one globed drop of dew!
1027,II.,"But for the most I thought of heat,"
1028,II.,Desiring greatly....  Hot white sand
1029,II.,"The lazy body lies at rest in,"
1030,II.,"Or sun-dried, scented grass to nest in,"
1031,II.,"And fires, innumerable fires,"
1032,II.,Great fagots hurling golden gyres
1033,II.,"Of sparks far up, and the red heart"
1034,II.,"In sea-coals, crashing as they part"
1035,II.,"To tiny flares, and kindling snapping,"
1036,II.,Bunched sticks that burst their string and wrapping

1039,II.,"And heavy, sullen lumps of coke"
1040,II.,"With still, fierce heat and ugly smoke...."
1041,II.,"... And then the vision of his face,"
1042,II.,"And theirs, all theirs, came like a sword,"
1043,II.,"Thrice, to the heart -- and as I fell"
1044,II.,I thought I saw a light before.
1045,II.,
1046,II.,"I woke.  My hands were blue and sore,"
1047,II.,Torn on the ice.  I scarcely felt
1048,II.,The frozen sleet begin to melt
1049,II.,"Upon my face as I breathed deeper,"
1050,II.,"But lay there warmly, like a sleeper"
1051,II.,"Who shifts his arm once, and moans low,"
1052,II.,"And then sinks back to night.  Slow, slow,"
1053,II.,"And still as Death, came Sleep and Death"
1054,II.,And looked at me with quiet breath.
1055,II.,"Unbending figures, black and stark"
1056,II.,Against the intense deeps of the dark.
1057,II.,Tall and like trees.  Like sweet and fire
1058,II.,"Rest crept and crept along my veins,"
1059,II.,Gently.  And there were no more pains....
1060,II.,
1061,II.,Was it not better so to lie?
1062,II.,The fight was done.  Even gods tire
1063,II.,Of fighting....  My way was the wrong.
1064,II.,Now I should drift and drift along
1065,II.,"To endless quiet, golden peace..."
1066,II.,And let the tortured body cease.
1067,II.,
1068,II.,And then a light winked like an eye.
1069,II.,... And very many miles away
1070,II.,"A girl stood at a warm, lit door,"
1071,II.,Holding a lamp.  Ray upon ray
1072,II.,It cloaked the snow with perfect light.
1073,II.,And where she was there was no night
1074,II.,"Nor could be, ever.  God is sure,"
1075,II.,And in his hands are things secure.
1076,II.,It is not given me to trace
1077,II.,"The lovely laughter of that face,"
1078,II.,"Like a clear brook most full of light,"
1079,II.,"Or olives swaying on a height,"
1080,II.,"So silver they have wings, almost;"
1081,II.,Like a great word once known and lost
1082,II.,And meaning all things.  Nor her voice
1083,II.,"A happy sound where larks rejoice,"
1084,II.,"Her body, that great loveliness,"
1085,II.,"The tender fashion of her dress,"
1086,II.,I may not paint them.
1087,II.,"These I see,"
1088,II.,"Blazing through all eternity,"
1089,II.,"A fire-winged sign, a glorious tree!"
1090,II.,
1091,II.,"She stood there, and at once I knew"
1092,II.,The bitter thing that I must do.
1093,II.,There could be no surrender now;
1094,II.,Though Sleep and Death were whispering low.
1095,II.,My way was wrong.  So.  Would it mend
1096,II.,If I shrank back before the end?
1097,II.,And sank to death and cowardice?
1098,II.,"No, the last lees must be drained up,"
1099,II.,Base wine from an ignoble cup;
1100,II.,(Yet not so base as sleek content
1101,II.,When I had shrunk from punishment)
1102,II.,The wretched body strain anew!
1103,II.,Life was a storm to wander through.
1104,II.,"I took the wrong way.  Good and well,"
1105,II.,At least my feet sought out not Hell!
1106,II.,Though night were one consuming flame
1107,II.,"I must go on for my base aim,"
1108,II.,"And so, perhaps, make evil grow"
1109,II.,To something clean by agony...
1110,II.,And reach that light upon the snow...
1111,II.,And touch her dress at last...
1112,II.,"So, so,"
1113,II.,I crawled.  I could not speak or see
1114,II.,"Save dimly.  The ice glared like fire,"
1115,II.,"A long bright Hell of choking cold,"
1116,II.,"And each vein was a tautened wire,"
1117,II.,Throbbing with torture -- and I crawled.
1118,II.,My hands were wounds.
1119,II.,So I attained
1120,II.,The second Hell.  The snow was stained
1121,II.,"I thought, and shook my head at it"
1122,II.,How red it was!  Black tree-roots clutched
1123,II.,And tore -- and soon the snow was smutched
1124,II.,"Anew; and I lurched babbling on,"
1125,II.,"And then fell down to rest a bit,"
1126,II.,And came upon another Hell...
1127,II.,"Loose stones that ice made terrible,"
1128,II.,That rolled and gashed men as they fell.
1129,II.,"I stumbled, slipped... and all was gone"
1130,II.,That I had gained.  Once more I lay
1131,II.,Before the long bright Hell of ice.
1132,II.,And still the light was far away.
1133,II.,There was red mist before my eyes
1134,II.,Or I could tell you how I went
1135,II.,"Across the swaying firmament,"
1136,II.,"A glittering torture of cold stars,"
1137,II.,And how I fought in Titan wars...
1138,II.,And died... and lived again upon
1139,II.,The rack... and how the horses strain
1140,II.,When their red task is nearly done....
1141,II.,
1142,II.,"I only know that there was Pain,"
1143,II.,Infinite and eternal Pain.
1144,II.,And that I fell -- and rose again.
1145,II.,
1146,II.,So she was walking in the road.
1147,II.,"And I stood upright like a man,"
1148,II.,"Once, and fell blind, and heard her cry..."
1149,II.,And then there came long agony.
1150,II.,"There was no pain when I awoke,"
1151,II.,"No pain at all.  Rest, like a goad,"
1152,II.,Spurred my eyes open -- and light broke
1153,II.,Upon them like a million swords:
1154,II.,And she was there.  There are no words.
1155,II.,
1156,II.,Heaven is for a moment's span.
1157,II.,And ever.
1158,II.,"So I spoke and said,"
1159,II.,"""My honor stands up unbetrayed,"
1160,II.,"And I have seen you.  Dear..."""
1161,II.,Sharp pain
1162,II.,Closed like a cloak....
1163,II.,I moaned and died.
1164,II.,
1165,II.,"Here, even here, these things remain."
1166,II.,I shall draw nearer to her side.
1167,II.,
1168,II.,"Oh dear and laughing, lost to me,"
1169,II.,"Hidden in grey Eternity,"
1170,II.,"I shall attain, with burning feet,"
1171,II.,To you and to the mercy-seat!
1172,II.,"The ages crumble down like dust,"
1173,II.,"Dark roses, deviously thrust"
1174,II.,"And scattered in sweet wine -- but I,"
1175,II.,"I shall lift up to you my cry,"
1176,II.,And kiss your wet lips presently
1177,II.,Beneath the ever-living Tree.
1178,II.,
1179,II.,This in my heart I keep for goad!

1454,II.,Captain Hawk scourged clean the seas
1455,II.,(Black is the gap below the plank)
1456,II.,From the Great North Bank to the Caribbees
1457,II.,(Down by the marsh the hemp grows rank).
1458,II.,
1459,II.,"His fear was on the seaport towns,"
1460,II.,The weight of his hand held hard the downs.
1461,II.,"And the merchants cursed him, bitter and black,"
1462,II.,For a red flame in the sea-fog's wrack
1463,II.,Was all of their ships that might come back.
1464,II.,
1465,II.,"For all he had one word alone,"
1466,II.,"One clod of dirt in their faces thrown,"
1467,II.,"""The hemp that shall hang me is not grown!"""
1468,II.,
1469,II.,His name bestrode the seas like Death.
1470,II.,The waters trembled at his breath.
1471,II.,
1472,II.,"This is the tale of how he fell,"
1473,II.,"Of the long sweep and the heavy swell,"
1474,II.,And the rope that dragged him down to hell.
1475,II.,
1476,II.,"The fight was done, and the gutted ship,"
1477,II.,"Stripped like a shark the sea-gulls strip,"
1478,II.,
1479,II.,"Lurched blindly, eaten out with flame,"
1480,II.,"Back to the land from where she came,"
1481,II.,"A skimming horror, an eyeless shame."
1482,II.,
1483,II.,"And Hawk stood upon his quarter-deck,"
1484,II.,And saw the sky and saw the wreck.
1485,II.,
1486,II.,"Below, a butt for sailors' jeers,"
1487,II.,"White as the sky when a white squall nears,"
1488,II.,Huddled the crowd of the prisoners.
1489,II.,
1490,II.,"Over the bridge of the tottering plank,"
1491,II.,"Where the sea shook and the gulf yawned blank,"
1492,II.,"They shrieked and struggled and dropped and sank,"
1493,II.,
1494,II.,Pinioned arms and hands bound fast.
1495,II.,One girl alone was left at last.
1496,II.,
1497,II.,Sir Henry Gaunt was a mighty lord.
1498,II.,He sat in state at the Council board;
1499,II.,The governors were as nought to him.
1500,II.,From one rim to the other rim
1501,II.,
1502,II.,"Of his great plantations, flung out wide"
1503,II.,"Like a purple cloak, was a full month's ride."
1504,II.,
1505,II.,"Life and death in his white hands lay,"
1506,II.,"And his only daughter stood at bay,"
1507,II.,Trapped like a hare in the toils that day.
1508,II.,
1509,II.,"He sat at wine in his gold and his lace,"
1510,II.,"And far away, in a bloody place,"
1511,II.,"Hawk came near, and she covered her face."
1512,II.,
1513,II.,"He rode in the fields, and the hunt was brave,"
1514,II.,And far away his daughter gave
1515,II.,"A shriek that the seas cried out to hear,"
1516,II.,And he could not see and he could not save.
1517,II.,
1518,II.,Her white soul withered in the mire
1519,II.,"As paper shrivels up in fire,"
1520,II.,"And Hawk laughed, and he kissed her mouth,"
1521,II.,And her body he took for his desire.

1524,II.,The Growing of the Hemp.
1525,II.,
1526,II.,
1527,II.,"Sir Henry stood in the manor room,"
1528,II.,And his eyes were hard gems in the gloom.
1529,II.,
1530,II.,"And he said, ""Go dig me furrows five"
1531,II.,Where the green marsh creeps like a thing alive --
1532,II.,"There at its edge, where the rushes thrive."""
1533,II.,
1534,II.,"And where the furrows rent the ground,"
1535,II.,He sowed the seed of hemp around.
1536,II.,
1537,II.,And the blacks shrink back and are sore afraid
1538,II.,"At the furrows five that rib the glade,"
1539,II.,And the voodoo work of the master's spade.
1540,II.,
1541,II.,"For a cold wind blows from the marshland near,"
1542,II.,"And white things move, and the night grows drear,"
1543,II.,And they chatter and crouch and are sick with fear.
1544,II.,
1545,II.,"But down by the marsh, where the gray slaves glean,"
1546,II.,"The hemp sprouts up, and the earth is seen"
1547,II.,Veiled with a tenuous mist of green.
1548,II.,
1549,II.,"And Hawk still scourges the Caribbees,"
1550,II.,And many men kneel at his knees.
1551,II.,
1552,II.,"Sir Henry sits in his house alone,"
1553,II.,And his eyes are hard and dull like stone.
1554,II.,
1555,II.,"And the waves beat, and the winds roar,"
1556,II.,And all things are as they were before.
1557,II.,
1558,II.,"And the days pass, and the weeks pass,"
1559,II.,And nothing changes but the grass.
1560,II.,
1561,II.,"But down where the fireflies are like eyes,"
1562,II.,"And the damps shudder, and the mists rise,"
1563,II.,The hemp-stalks stand up toward the skies.
1564,II.,
1565,II.,And down from the poop of the pirate ship
1566,II.,"A body falls, and the great sharks grip."
1567,II.,
1568,II.,"Innocent, lovely, go in grace!"
1569,II.,At last there is peace upon your face.
1570,II.,
1571,II.,"And Hawk laughs loud as the corpse is thrown,"
1572,II.,"""The hemp that shall hang me is not grown!"""
1573,II.,
1574,II.,"Sir Henry's face is iron to mark,"
1575,II.,And he gazes ever in the dark.
1576,II.,
1577,II.,"And the days pass, and the weeks pass,"
1578,II.,And the world is as it always was.
1579,II.,
1580,II.,"But down by the marsh the sickles beam,"
1581,II.,"Glitter on glitter, gleam on gleam,"
1582,II.,And the hemp falls down by the stagnant stream.
1583,II.,
1584,II.,"And Hawk beats up from the Caribbees,"
1585,II.,Swooping to pounce in the Northern seas.
1586,II.,
1587,II.,"Sir Henry sits sunk deep in his chair,"
1588,II.,And white as his hand is grown his hair.
1589,II.,
1590,II.,"And the days pass, and the weeks pass,"
1591,II.,And the sands roll from the hour-glass.
1592,II.,
1593,II.,But down by the marsh in the blazing sun
1594,II.,"The hemp is smoothed and twisted and spun,"
1595,II.,"The rope made, and the work done."

1603,II.,From the Great North Bank to the Caribbees
1604,II.,(Down by the marsh the hemp grows rank).
1605,II.,
1606,II.,"He sailed in the broad Atlantic track,"
1607,II.,And the ships that saw him came not back.
1608,II.,
1609,II.,"And once again, where the wide tides ran,"
1610,II.,He stooped to harry a merchantman.
1611,II.,
1612,II.,He bade her stop.  Ten guns spake true
1613,II.,"From her hidden ports, and a hidden crew,"
1614,II.,Lacking his great ship through and through.
1615,II.,
1616,II.,"Dazed and dumb with the sudden death,"
1617,II.,He scarce had time to draw a breath
1618,II.,
1619,II.,"Before the grappling-irons bit deep,"
1620,II.,And the boarders slew his crew like sheep.
1621,II.,
1622,II.,"Hawk stood up straight, his breast to the steel;"
1623,II.,His cutlass made a bloody wheel.
1624,II.,
1625,II.,His cutlass made a wheel of flame.
1626,II.,They shrank before him as he came.
1627,II.,
1628,II.,"And the bodies fell in a choking crowd,"
1629,II.,"And still he thundered out aloud,"
1630,II.,
1631,II.,"""The hemp that shall hang me is not grown!"""
1632,II.,They fled at last.  He was left alone.
1633,II.,
1634,II.,Before his foe Sir Henry stood.
1635,II.,"""The hemp is grown, and my word made good!"""
1636,II.,
1637,II.,And the cutlass clanged with a hissing whir
1638,II.,On the lashing blade of the rapier.
1639,II.,
1640,II.,Hawk roared and charged like a maddened buck.
1641,II.,"As the cobra strikes, Sir Henry struck,"
1642,II.,
1643,II.,"Pouring his life in a single thrust,"
1644,II.,And the cutlass shivered to sparks and dust.
1645,II.,
1646,II.,"Sir Henry stood on the blood-stained deck,"
1647,II.,And set his foot on his foe's neck.
1648,II.,
1649,II.,"Then from the hatch, where the rent decks slope,"
1650,II.,"Where the dead roll and the wounded grope,"
1651,II.,He dragged the serpent of the rope.
1652,II.,
1653,II.,"The sky was blue, and the sea was still,"
1654,II.,"The waves lapped softly, hill on hill,"
1655,II.,And between one wave and another wave
1656,II.,The doomed man's cries were little and shrill.
1657,II.,
1658,II.,"The sea was blue, and the sky was calm;"
1659,II.,The air dripped with a golden balm.
1660,II.,"Like a wind-blown fruit between sea and sun,"
1661,II.,A black thing writhed at a yard-arm.
1662,II.,
1663,II.,"Slowly then, and awesomely,"
1664,II.,"The ship sank, and the gallows-tree,"
1665,II.,And there was nought between sea and sun --
1666,II.,Nought but the sun and the sky and the sea.
1667,II.,
1668,II.,"But down by the marsh where the fever breeds,"
1669,II.,Only the water chuckles and pleads;
1670,II.,"For the hemp clings fast to a dead man's throat,"
1671,II.,And blind Fate gathers back her seeds.

1682,II.,"I loved once, crushed me with an iron yoke."
1683,II.,"I longed for the cool quiet and the dark,"
1684,II.,Under the common sod where louts and kings
1685,II.,"Lie down, serene, unheeding, careless, stark,"
1686,II.,"Never to rise or move or feel again,"
1687,II.,Filled with the ecstasy of being dead....
1688,II.,
1689,II.,I put the shining pistol to my head
1690,II.,"And pulled the trigger hard -- I felt no pain,"
1691,II.,No pain at all; the pistol had missed fire
1692,II.,"I thought; then, looking at the floor, I saw"
1693,II.,My huddled body lying there -- and awe
1694,II.,Swept over me.  I trembled -- and looked up.
1695,II.,"About me was -- not that, my heart's desire,"
1696,II.,That small and dark abode of death and peace --
1697,II.,But all from which I sought a vain release!
1698,II.,"The sky, the people and the staring sun"
1699,II.,Glared at me as before.  I was undone.
1700,II.,My last state ten times worse than was my first.
1701,II.,"Helpless I stood, befooled, betrayed, accursed,"
1702,II.,"Fettered to Life forever, horribly;"
1703,II.,"Caught in the meshes of Eternity,"

1780,I.,"You hear, Father?  Hsh, he is asleep in the night's cloak."
1781,I.,
1782,I.,Over me too steals sleep.
1783,I.,Sleep like a white mist on the rotting paintings of cupids and gods
1784,I.,on the ceiling;
1785,I.,"Sleep on the carven shields and knots at the foot of the bed,"
1786,I.,"Oozing, blurring outlines, obliterating colors,"

1788,I.,
1789,I.,"Father, Father, I must not sleep!"

1801,II.,The grass beneath it is gray; the stars pale in the sky.
1802,II.,The night dew has fallen;
1803,II.,"An infinity of little drops, crystals from which all light has been taken,"
1804,II.,Glint on the sighing branches.
1805,II.,"All is purity, without color, without stir, without passion."
1806,II.,
1807,II.,Suddenly a peacock screams.
1808,II.,
1809,II.,My heart shocks and stops;
1810,II.,"Sweat, cold corpse-sweat"

1812,II.,My hair stands on end.  I cannot stir.  I cannot speak.
1813,II.,"It is terror, terror that is walking the pale sick gardens"

1815,II.,Ah-h-h-h-h!
1816,II.,"Father, Father, wake! wake and save me!"
1817,II.,In his corner all is shadow.
1818,II.,
1819,II.,Dead things creep from the ground.

1822,II.,"Fiends, do you not know that she is dead?..."
1823,II.,"""Let us dance the pavon!"" she said; the waxlights glittered like swords"
1824,II.,on the polished floor.
1825,II.,"Twinkling on jewelled snuffboxes, beaming savagely from the crass gold"
1826,II.,"of candelabra,"
1827,II.,From the white shoulders of girls and the white powdered wigs of men...
1828,II.,All life was that dance.
1829,II.,"The mocking, resistless current,"
1830,II.,"The beauty, the passion, the perilous madness --"
1831,II.,"As she took my hand, released it and spread her dresses like petals,"
1832,II.,"Turning, swaying in beauty,"
1833,II.,"A lily, bowed by the rain, --"
1834,II.,"Moonlight she was, and her body of moonlight and foam,"
1835,II.,And her eyes stars.
1836,II.,Oh the dance has a pattern!
1837,II.,"But the clear grace of her thrilled through the notes of the viols,"
1838,II.,"Tremulous, pleading, escaping, immortal, untamed,"
1839,II.,"And, as we ended,"
1840,II.,She blew me a kiss from her hand like a drifting white blossom --
1841,II.,And the starshine was gone; and she fled like a bird up the stair.
1842,II.,
1843,II.,"Underneath the window a peacock screams,"
1844,II.,"And claws click, scrape"
1845,II.,Like little lacquered boots on the rough stone.
1846,II.,
1847,II.,"Oh the long fantasy of the kiss; the ceaseless hunger, ceaselessly,"
1848,II.,divinely appeased!
1849,II.,The aching presence of the beloved's beauty!
1850,II.,"The wisdom, the incense, the brightness!"
1851,II.,
1852,II.,Once more on the ice-bright floor they danced the pavon
1853,II.,But I turned to the garden and her from the lighted candles.
1854,II.,Softly I trod the lush grass between the black hedges of box.
1855,II.,"Softly, for I should take her unawares and catch her arms,"
1856,II.,"And embrace her, dear and startled."
1857,II.,
1858,II.,By the arbor all the moonlight flowed in silver
1859,II.,And her head was on his breast.
1860,II.,She did not scream or shudder
1861,II.,When my sword was where her head had lain
1862,II.,In the quiet moonlight;
1863,II.,"But turned to me with one pale hand uplifted,"
1864,II.,"All her satins fiery with the starshine,"
1865,II.,"Nacreous, shimmering, weeping, iridescent,"
1866,II.,Like the quivering plumage of a peacock...
1867,II.,"Then her head drooped and I gripped her hair,"
1868,II.,"Oh soft, scented cloud across my fingers! --"
1869,II.,Bending her white neck back....
1870,II.,
1871,II.,Blood writhed on my hands; I trod in blood....
1872,II.,Stupidly agaze
1873,II.,"At that crumpled heap of silk and moonlight,"
1874,II.,"Where like twitching pinions, an arm twisted,"
1875,II.,"Palely, and was still"
1876,II.,As the face of chalk.

1883,II.,Shattering the moonlight.
1884,II.,White wings fan.
1885,II.,"Father, Father!"
1886,II.,
1887,II.,"All its plumage fiery with the starshine,"
1888,II.,"Nacreous, shimmering, weeping, iridescent,"
1889,II.,"It drifts across the floor and mounts the bed,"
1890,II.,To the tap of little satin shoes.
1891,II.,Gazing with infernal eyes.
1892,II.,"Its quick beak thrusting, rending, devil's crimson..."
1893,II.,"Screams, great tortured screams shake the dark canopy."
1894,II.,"The light flickers, the shadow in the corner stirs;"
1895,II.,The wax face lifts; the eyes open.

1916,II.,Scarlet screamed out above the battered gold

1935,II.,"Yet, if you hold me close against the ear,"
1936,II.,"A dim, far whisper rises clamorously,"

1958,II.,"From Bel, there, as he slept... Look! -- oh look, look!"
1959,II.,They've got at Nero!  Oh it isn't fair!
1960,II.,"Lord, how he squeals!  Stop it... it's, well -- indecent!"

1965,II.,"Black, strangling trees, whispering obscene things"
1966,II.,"Amongst their branches, clutching with maimed hands,"
1967,II.,"Or oozing slowly, like blind tentacles"
1968,II.,Up to the gates; higher than that heaped brick
1969,II.,Man piled to smite the sun.  And all around
1970,II.,Are devils.  One can laugh... but that hunched shape
1971,II.,"The face one stone, like those Assyrian kings!"
1972,II.,"One sees in carvings, watching men flayed red"
1973,II.,Horribly laughable in leaps and writhes;
1974,II.,"That face -- utterly evil, clouded round"

1976,II.,"... And Nero there, the flabby cheeks astrain"
1977,II.,And sweating agony... long agony...

1986,II.,She stands there in the sun.
1987,II.,... It seems so quaint she should have long gold wings.
1988,II.,I never have got used -- folded across
1989,II.,"Her breast, or fluttering with fierce, pure light,"
1990,II.,"Like shaken steel.  Her crown too.  Well, it's queer!"
1991,II.,And then she never cared much for the harp
1992,II.,"On earth.  Here, though..."
1993,II.,"She is all peace, all quiet,"
1994,II.,"All passionate desires, the eloquent thunder"
1995,II.,"Of new, glad suns, shouting aloud for joy,"
1996,II.,"Over fresh worlds and clean, trampling the air"
1997,II.,"Like stooping hawks, to the long wind of horns,"
1998,II.,Flung from the bastions of Eternity...
1999,II.,"And she is the low lake, drowsy and gentle,"
2000,II.,"And good words spoken from the tongues of friends,"
2001,II.,"And calmness in the evening, and deep thoughts,"
2002,II.,Falling like dreams from the stars' solemn mouths.
2003,II.,All these.
2004,II.,They said she was unfaithful once.
2005,II.,"Or I remembered it -- and so, for that,"
2006,II.,"I lie here, I suppose.  Yes, so they said."
2007,II.,"You see she is so troubled, looking down,"
2008,II.,Sorrowing deeply for my torments.  I
2009,II.,"Of course, feel nothing while I see her -- save"
2010,II.,"That sometimes when I think the matter out,"
2011,II.,"And what earth-people said of us, of her,"
2012,II.,"It seems as if I must be, here, in heaven,"
2013,II.,And she --
2014,II.,... Then I grow proud; and suddenly
2015,II.,"There comes a splatter of oil against my skin,"
2016,II.,Hurting this time.  And I forget my pride:
2017,II.,And my face writhes.
2018,II.,Some day the little ladder
2019,II.,"Of white words that I build up, up, to her"

2375,II.,"With shouting faces, turned a pasty white"
2376,II.,"By the strange light, for foam.  They all had clods,"
2377,II.,Or slimy balls of mud.  A few gripped stones.
2378,II.,"And there, his back against the battered door,"
2379,II.,"His pile of books scattered about his feet,"
2380,II.,"Stood Shelley while two others held him fast,"
2381,II.,And the clods beat upon him.  `Shelley!  Shelley!'
2382,II.,"The high shouts rang through all the corridors,"
2383,II.,`Shelley!  Mad Shelley!  Come along and help!'
2384,II.,"And all the crowd dug madly at the earth,"
2385,II.,"Scratching and clawing at the streaming mud,"
2386,II.,And fouled each other and themselves.  And still
2387,II.,Shelley stood up.  His eyes were like a flame
2388,II.,"Set in some white, still room; for all his face"
2389,II.,"Was white, a whiteness like no human color,"
2390,II.,But white and dreadful as consuming fire.
2391,II.,"His hands shook now and then, like slender cords"
2392,II.,Which bear too heavy weights.  He did not speak.
2393,II.,"So I saw Shelley plain."""
2394,II.,"""And you?"" I said."
2395,II.,
2396,II.,"""I?  I threw straighter than the most of them,"
2397,II.,"And had firm clods.  I hit him -- well, at least"
2398,II.,"Thrice in the face.  He made good sport that night."""

2551,II.,
2552,II.,
2553,II.,Stephen Vincent Bene't (22 July 1898 - 13 March 1943) was from a family
2554,II.,"with roots in Florida, which explains the Spanish name.  Although born"
2555,II.,"in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, his father was a colonel in the U.S. Army,"
2556,II.,and hence he grew up in California and Georgia.  He attended Yale
2557,II.,"starting in 1915 and that same year published his first book of poems,"
2558,II.,`Five Men and Pompey'.  `Young Adventure' (1918) is considered his first
2559,II.,"mature book of poetry, and he went on to win two Pulitzer Prizes, in"
2560,II.,1929 for `John Brown's Body' and in 1944 for `Western Star'.
2561,II.,
2562,II.,"It appears that the whole family had great talents, as his grandfather"
2563,II.,"was a Brigadier General, his father a Colonel, and both Stephen and his"
2564,II.,brother William Rose Benet won Pulitzer Prizes for poetry.
