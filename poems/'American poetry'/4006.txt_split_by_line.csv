140,FOREWORD,
141,FOREWORD,
142,FOREWORD,This little volume might be called 'Echoes from the land of youthful
143,FOREWORD,imaginings'; or 'Ghosts of old dreams.'  It has been compiled at the
144,FOREWORD,request of Messrs. Gay and Hancock (my only authorised publishers in
145,FOREWORD,"Great Britain), and contains verses written in my early youth, and which"
146,FOREWORD,"never before (with the exception, perhaps, of three or four) have been"
147,FOREWORD,placed in book form.
148,FOREWORD,
149,FOREWORD,"Given the poetical temperament, and a lonely environment, with few"
150,FOREWORD,"distractions, youthful imagination is sure to express itself in mournful"
151,FOREWORD,wails and despairing moans.  Such wails and moans will be found to excess
152,FOREWORD,"in this little book, and will serve to show better than any amount of"
153,FOREWORD,"common-sense reasoning, how fleeting are the sorrows of youth, and how"
154,FOREWORD,slight the foundation on which the young build towers of despair.
155,FOREWORD,
156,FOREWORD,"In the days when these verses were written, each little song represented"
157,FOREWORD,"a few dollars (to my emaciated purse), and so the slightest experience of"
158,FOREWORD,"my own, or of any friend, with every passing mood, every trivial"
159,FOREWORD,"happening, was utilised by my imaginative and thrifty muse."
160,FOREWORD,
161,FOREWORD,"That the writer has always possessed robust health, and has lived to a"
162,FOREWORD,"good age, is proof positive that the verses are not all expressions of"
163,FOREWORD,"personal experiences, since no human being could have borne such"
164,FOREWORD,continual agonies and retained life and reason.
165,FOREWORD,
166,FOREWORD,All the verses in the book were written while I bore the name of Ella
167,FOREWORD,"Wheeler, and are quite inconsistent with the ideas and philosophy of"

179,AN OLD HEART,"How young I am!  Ah! heaven, this curse of youth"
180,AN OLD HEART,"Doth mock me from my mirror with great eyes,"
181,AN OLD HEART,"And pulsing veins repeat the unwelcome truth,"
182,AN OLD HEART,"That I must live, though hope within me dies."
183,AN OLD HEART,
184,AN OLD HEART,"So young, and yet I have had all of life."
185,AN OLD HEART,"Why, men have lived to see a hundred years,"
186,AN OLD HEART,"Who have not known the rapture, joy, and strife"
187,AN OLD HEART,"Of my brief youth, its passion and its tears."
188,AN OLD HEART,
189,AN OLD HEART,Oh! what are years?  A ripe three score and ten
190,AN OLD HEART,"Hold often less of life, in its best sense,"
191,AN OLD HEART,"Than just a twelvemonth lived by other men,"
192,AN OLD HEART,Whose high-strung souls are ardent and intense.

194,AN OLD HEART,"But having seen all depths and scaled all heights,"
195,AN OLD HEART,"Having a heart love thrilled, and sorrow wrung,"
196,AN OLD HEART,"Knowing all pains, all pleasures, all delights,"
197,AN OLD HEART,"Now I would die--but cannot, being young."

208,WARP AND WOOF,
209,WARP AND WOOF,
210,WARP AND WOOF,"Through the sunshine, and through the rain"
211,WARP AND WOOF,"Of these changing days of mist and splendour,"
212,WARP AND WOOF,I see the face of a year-old pain
213,WARP AND WOOF,Looking at me with a smile half tender.
214,WARP AND WOOF,
215,WARP AND WOOF,"With a smile half tender, and yet all sad,"
216,WARP AND WOOF,Into each hour of the mild September
217,WARP AND WOOF,"It comes, and finding my life grown glad"
218,WARP AND WOOF,"Looks down in my eyes, and says 'Remember.'"
219,WARP AND WOOF,
220,WARP AND WOOF,"Says 'Remember,' and points behind"
221,WARP AND WOOF,"To days of sorrow, and tear-wet lashes;"
222,WARP AND WOOF,"When joy lay dead and hope was blind,"
223,WARP AND WOOF,And nothing was left but dust and ashes.
224,WARP AND WOOF,
225,WARP AND WOOF,"Dust and ashes and vain regret,"
226,WARP AND WOOF,"Flames fanned out, and the embers falling."
227,WARP AND WOOF,"But the sun of the saddest day must set,"
228,WARP AND WOOF,And hope wakes ever with Springtime's calling.
229,WARP AND WOOF,
230,WARP AND WOOF,With Springtime's calling the pulses thrill;
231,WARP AND WOOF,And the heart is tuned to a sweeter measure.
232,WARP AND WOOF,For never a green Spring crossed the hill
233,WARP AND WOOF,That came not laden with some new pleasure.
234,WARP AND WOOF,
235,WARP AND WOOF,Some new pleasure that brings content;
236,WARP AND WOOF,"And the heart looks up with a smile of gladness,"
237,WARP AND WOOF,And wonders idly when sorrow went
238,WARP AND WOOF,Out of the life that seemed all sadness.
239,WARP AND WOOF,
240,WARP AND WOOF,"That seemed all sadness, and yet grew bright"
241,WARP AND WOOF,With colours we thought could tinge it never.
242,WARP AND WOOF,"Yet I think the pain though out of sight,"
243,WARP AND WOOF,"Like the warp of the carpet, is there for ever."
244,WARP AND WOOF,
245,WARP AND WOOF,"There for ever, and by and by"
246,WARP AND WOOF,"When the woof wears thin, or draws asunder,"
247,WARP AND WOOF,We see the sombre threads that lie
248,WARP AND WOOF,Intertwining and twisting under.
249,WARP AND WOOF,
250,WARP AND WOOF,Twisting under and binding so
251,WARP AND WOOF,The brighter threads that they may not sever.
252,WARP AND WOOF,Thus the pain of a year ago
253,WARP AND WOOF,Must stay a part of my life for ever.

273,SO LONG,"Under my window there blooms a rose,"
274,SO LONG,(How long a day can be.)

285,SO LONG,"The summer sun rides high and clear,"
286,SO LONG,"(The day is long, so long,)"
287,SO LONG,How long it must be ere it grows to a year--

289,SO LONG,But only a wail of song.

321,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,
322,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,
323,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Why should we sigh o'er a summer that's dead--
324,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Let us think of the summer to be.
325,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,"It always better to look ahead,"
326,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,For the rose will come again just as red
327,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,And just as fair to see.
328,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,
329,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Why should we weep o'er a pleasure past--
330,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Let us look for the pleasure to be.
331,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,New shells on the shore by new waves are cast;
332,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,"Let us prize each new joy more than the last,"
333,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,And laugh if the old joy flee.
334,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,
335,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,What folly to die for a love that was--
336,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Let us live for the one to be.
337,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,"For time is passing, and will not pause;"
338,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,How foolish the shore were it sad because
339,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,One wave ebbed out to sea.
340,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,
341,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Then let us not sing of a year that is fled--
342,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,Though dear its memory be:
343,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,"For though summer and pleasure and love seem dead,"
344,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,"Love will be sweet, and the rose will be red"
345,WHY SHOULD WE SIGH,When they blossom for you and me.

351,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,
352,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,
353,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,In the dark and the gloom when winds were fretting
354,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"Like restless children worn out with play,"
355,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"I said to my heart, 'This task, forgetting--"
356,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,Is harder now than it is by day.
357,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"For a hungry love that hides from the light,"
358,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"Like a tiger steals forth, and is bold at night.'"
359,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,
360,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,The wind wailed low like a woman weeping;
361,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,Deeper and darker the dense gloom grew.
362,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"And, oh! for the old, sweet nights of sleeping,"
363,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"When dreams were happy, and love was true."
364,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,Before the stars from heaven went out
365,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,In a sudden blackness of dread and doubt.
366,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,
367,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"The wind wailed loud, like a madman shrieking,"
368,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"And I said to my heart, 'Oh! vain, vain strife;"
369,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"We cannot forget, and the peace we are seeking"
370,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,Can only be won at the end of life.
371,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,For see! like a lurid and living spark
372,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,The eyes of the tiger shine through the dark.'
373,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,
374,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"The wind sighed low like a sick man dying,"
375,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,And the dawn crept silently over the hill.
376,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"And I said, 'O heart! there is no use trying,"
377,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"We must _remember_, and love on still.'"
378,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,"And the tiger, appeased with its midnight feast,"
379,A WAKEFUL NIGHT,Fled as the dawn rose red in the East.

418,TWO,As I sat in my opera box last night
419,TWO,"In a glimmer of gems and a blaze of light,"
420,TWO,"And smiling that all might see,"
421,TWO,This curious thought came all unsought--
422,TWO,That there were _two_ of me.
423,TWO,
424,TWO,"One who sat in her silk and lace,"
425,TWO,"With gems on her bosom and smiles on her face,"
426,TWO,"And hot-house blossoms in her hair,"
427,TWO,While her fan kept time to the swaying rhyme
428,TWO,Of the lilting opera air.
429,TWO,
430,TWO,"And one who sat in the dark somewhere,"
431,TWO,"With her wan face hid by her falling hair,"
432,TWO,And her hands clasped over her eyes;
433,TWO,And the sickening pain of heart and brain
434,TWO,Breathed out in long-drawn sighs.
435,TWO,
436,TWO,One in the sheen of her opera suit;
437,TWO,"And one who was swathed from head to foot,"
438,TWO,In crepe of the blackest dye.
439,TWO,"One hiding her heart and playing a part,"
440,TWO,And one with her mask thrown by.
441,TWO,
442,TWO,"But over the voice of the singer there,"
443,TWO,"The one who sat with a rose in her hair,"
444,TWO,Seemed ever to hear the moan
445,TWO,Of the one who kept in the dark and wept
446,TWO,With her desolate heart alone.

467,NO COMFORT,"What know they of the world to-day,"
468,NO COMFORT,Of hearts that are silently breaking;
469,NO COMFORT,"Of the human breast, and its great unrest,"
470,NO COMFORT,"And its pitiless aching, aching?"
471,NO COMFORT,
472,NO COMFORT,They send me out into Nature's heart
473,NO COMFORT,"For help to bear my sorrow,"
474,NO COMFORT,"Nothing of strength can she impart,"

476,NO COMFORT,"Her rose-red June and her billing tune,"
477,NO COMFORT,"Her birds and blossoms only,"
478,NO COMFORT,"Mocked at the grief that seeks relief,"
479,NO COMFORT,And leave me lonely--lonely.
480,NO COMFORT,"If I might stand on the treacherous sand,"

985,GERALDINE,"Of liquid amber, flecked with caps of gold, I told"
986,GERALDINE,"The sweet old story unto Geraldine, my Queen,"
987,GERALDINE,Who long hath made the whole of life for me.

989,GERALDINE,"But though she smiled upon me yesterday,"

991,GERALDINE,She held me but as one of many men; and then
992,GERALDINE,"Dismissed me in her proud, yet gracious way."
993,GERALDINE,
994,GERALDINE,"Ah, Geraldine! my lady of sweet arts,"
995,GERALDINE,"There waits for thee not very far away, a day"
996,GERALDINE,"When thou shalt waken out of tranquil sleep, and weep"
997,GERALDINE,Such bitter tears as spring from anguished hearts.
998,GERALDINE,
999,GERALDINE,Thou shalt look in thy mirror with dismay
1000,GERALDINE,"To find upon each feature of thy face, the trace"
1001,GERALDINE,"Of time, the lover who shall follow thee, and see"
1002,GERALDINE,Thy rare youth slipping suddenly away.
1003,GERALDINE,
1004,GERALDINE,"So self-assured, so certain of thy power,"
1005,GERALDINE,It shall come on thee with a swift surprise.  Thine eyes
1006,GERALDINE,"Appalled, shall fall upon each certain, strange, sad change,"
1007,GERALDINE,And rob thee of thy triumph in an hour.
1008,GERALDINE,
1009,GERALDINE,"And when that day shall come, as come it must,"
1010,GERALDINE,"You then will think of me, sweet Geraldine, my Queen,"
1011,GERALDINE,"And of the faithful heart there tossed away one day,"
1012,GERALDINE,Before thy dead sea apples turned to dust.
1013,GERALDINE,
1014,GERALDINE,"To dust and ashes, leaving nothing more,"
1015,GERALDINE,"That day will come, my lady, I can wait; and Fate"

1865,THE LAW,"To grace and perfume sweeter than the rose,"
1866,THE LAW,Or leave neglected while our heart soil grows
1867,THE LAW,"Rank with that vile and poison thistle, hate."
1868,THE LAW,
1869,THE LAW,"Love is a joyous thrush, that one can teach"
1870,THE LAW,To sing sweet lute-like songs which all may hear.
1871,THE LAW,Or we can silence him and tune the ear
1872,THE LAW,"To caw of crows, or to the vulture's screech."
1873,THE LAW,
1874,THE LAW,Love is a feast; and if the guests divide
1875,THE LAW,"With all who pass, though thousands swell the van,"
1876,THE LAW,There shall be food and drink for every man;
1877,THE LAW,The loaves and fishes will be multiplied.
1878,THE LAW,
1879,THE LAW,Love is the guide.  I look to heights above
1880,THE LAW,"So beautiful, so very far away;"
1881,THE LAW,"Yet I shall tread their sunlit peaks some day,"
1882,THE LAW,Since close in mine I hold the hand of love.
1883,THE LAW,
1884,THE LAW,Love is the law.  But yield to its control
1885,THE LAW,"And thou shalt find all things work for the best,"
1886,THE LAW,"And in the calm, still heaven of thy breast,"
1887,THE LAW,"That God, Himself, sits talking with thy soul."

2438,UN RENCONTRE,With never one thrill of emotion.
2439,UN RENCONTRE,

3171,TWO ROOMS,You know sweet love is there.
3172,TWO ROOMS,
3173,TWO ROOMS,"In one, there lies a white and wasted face"
3174,TWO ROOMS,"Whereon is frozen such supreme despair,"

3176,TWO ROOMS,You know love _has been_ there.
3177,TWO ROOMS,
3178,TWO ROOMS,To one he comes!  She leans her head of gold
3179,TWO ROOMS,Upon his breast and bids him no more roam.
3180,TWO ROOMS,"Ah God!  Ah God! and one lies stark and cold,"
3181,TWO ROOMS,Because he ceased to come.

3189,THREE AT THE OPERA,Last night the house was crowded.  Were you there?
3190,THREE AT THE OPERA,"You thought our box held only two, maybe--"
3191,THREE AT THE OPERA,"Myself and chaperon, a matron fair."
3192,THREE AT THE OPERA,There was another whom you did not see.
3193,THREE AT THE OPERA,
3194,THREE AT THE OPERA,"Close, close beside me, sat a phantom form;"
3195,THREE AT THE OPERA,Above the music and loud cheer on cheer
3196,THREE AT THE OPERA,"That rose, and thundered like a sudden storm,"
3197,THREE AT THE OPERA,I heard his low voice whispering in my ear.
3198,THREE AT THE OPERA,
3199,THREE AT THE OPERA,A dead man's voice.  You know when dead men speak
3200,THREE AT THE OPERA,There is no noise their least tone will not drown.
3201,THREE AT THE OPERA,"His sweet soft words brought blushes to my cheek,"
3202,THREE AT THE OPERA,And made my happy eyelids flutter down.
3203,THREE AT THE OPERA,
3204,THREE AT THE OPERA,"There were so many glasses turned on me,"
3205,THREE AT THE OPERA,"My chaperon was proud.  She called me fair,"
3206,THREE AT THE OPERA,"And said I drew their glances.  Well, may be."
3207,THREE AT THE OPERA,_I_ think they saw that dead man sitting there.
3208,THREE AT THE OPERA,
3209,THREE AT THE OPERA,A dead man at an opera: how strange!
3210,THREE AT THE OPERA,I know it must have seemed much out of place.
3211,THREE AT THE OPERA,"He smiled, and spoke, and there was little change"
3212,THREE AT THE OPERA,In the white pallor of his perfect face.
3213,THREE AT THE OPERA,
3214,THREE AT THE OPERA,"Yet he was dead.  I knew it all the while,"
3215,THREE AT THE OPERA,I do not wonder people looked that way.
3216,THREE AT THE OPERA,It seemed so odd to see a dead man smile;
3217,THREE AT THE OPERA,Its strangeness never struck me till to-day.
3218,THREE AT THE OPERA,
3219,THREE AT THE OPERA,He rose and went out when we left our stall;
3220,THREE AT THE OPERA,"Rose up, went out, and vanished in the night."
3221,THREE AT THE OPERA,"He always sits beside me in that hall,"
3222,THREE AT THE OPERA,But goes when goes the music and the light.

3242,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,Were keeping the music's time.
3243,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,Like a leaf in the breeze of summer
3244,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"I drifted down the hall,"

3249,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,(A voice that is long since stilled)
3250,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"I felt the flush of a rising blush,"
3251,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,And my pulses leaped and thrilled.
3252,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"Once more in a sea of faces,"
3253,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,I only saw one face;
3254,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"And life grew bright with a new delight,"
3255,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,And sweet with a nameless grace.
3256,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,
3257,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"A crash of passionate music,"
3258,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,A hush and a silence then;
3259,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"The dancers rest in their pleasure quest,"
3260,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,And lo!  I am old again.
3261,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"Old and alone in my chamber,"
3262,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,"While the night wears wearily on,"
3263,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,And the pallid wraith of a broken faith--
3264,A STRAIN OF MUSIC,Keeps watch with me till the dawn.

3665,TWO FRIENDS,"All filled with vague and nameless longings, found"
3666,TWO FRIENDS,"Slow wasting Genius, who from spot to spot"
3667,TWO FRIENDS,"Went idly grazing, through the Realms of Thought."
3668,TWO FRIENDS,
3669,TWO FRIENDS,"Ambition cried, 'Come, wander forth with me;"
3670,TWO FRIENDS,I like thy face--but cannot stay with thee.'
3671,TWO FRIENDS,"'I will,' said Genius, 'for I needs must own"
3672,TWO FRIENDS,I'm getting dull by being much alone.'
3673,TWO FRIENDS,
3674,TWO FRIENDS,"'Your hands are cold--come, warm them at my fire,'"

3677,TWO FRIENDS,Lie gems untold.  Let's plough them out together.'
3678,TWO FRIENDS,
3679,TWO FRIENDS,"They bent like strong young oxen to the plough,"
3680,TWO FRIENDS,"This done, Ambition questioned, 'Whither now?"

3697,TWO FRIENDS,Ambition crowned fair Genius with a wreath.
3698,TWO FRIENDS,
3699,TWO FRIENDS,"All day they journeyed, swift from place to place;"

3716,I DIDN'T THINK,"Were traced back to their start,"
3717,I DIDN'T THINK,We'd find not one in ten begun
3718,I DIDN'T THINK,From want of willing heart.
3719,I DIDN'T THINK,"But there's a sly, woe-working elf"
3720,I DIDN'T THINK,"Who lurks about youth's brink,"
3721,I DIDN'T THINK,And sure dismay he brings alway--
3722,I DIDN'T THINK,"The elf, 'I didn't think.'"
3723,I DIDN'T THINK,
3724,I DIDN'T THINK,He seems so sorry when he's caught;
3725,I DIDN'T THINK,His mien is all contrite;
3726,I DIDN'T THINK,"He so regrets the woe he wrought,"
3727,I DIDN'T THINK,And wants to make things right.
3728,I DIDN'T THINK,But wishes do not heal a wound
3729,I DIDN'T THINK,Or weld a broken link;
3730,I DIDN'T THINK,"The heart aches on, the link is gone,"

3735,I DIDN'T THINK,In life's long run less harm has done
3736,I DIDN'T THINK,Because he is so rare;
3737,I DIDN'T THINK,"And one can be so stern with him,"
3738,I DIDN'T THINK,Can make the monster shrink;
3739,I DIDN'T THINK,"But, lack a day, what can we say"
3740,I DIDN'T THINK,To whining 'Didn't think'?
3741,I DIDN'T THINK,
3742,I DIDN'T THINK,This most unpleasant imp of strife
3743,I DIDN'T THINK,Pursues us everywhere.
3744,I DIDN'T THINK,There's scarcely one whole day of life
3745,I DIDN'T THINK,He does not cause us care;
3746,I DIDN'T THINK,"Small woes and great he brings the world,"
3747,I DIDN'T THINK,"Strong ships are forced to sink,"
3748,I DIDN'T THINK,"And trains from iron track are hurled, alack,"
3749,I DIDN'T THINK,By stupid 'Didn't think.'
3750,I DIDN'T THINK,
3751,I DIDN'T THINK,"When brain is comrade to the heart,"
3752,I DIDN'T THINK,"And heart from soul draws grace,"
3753,I DIDN'T THINK,'I didn't think will quick depart
3754,I DIDN'T THINK,For lack of resting-place.

3763,A BURIAL,A BURIAL
3764,A BURIAL,
3765,A BURIAL,
3766,A BURIAL,To-day I had a burial of my dead.
3767,A BURIAL,"There was no shroud, no coffin, and no pall,"
3768,A BURIAL,No prayers were uttered and no tears were shed--
3769,A BURIAL,I only turned a picture to the wall.
3770,A BURIAL,
3771,A BURIAL,A picture that had hung within my room
3772,A BURIAL,For years and years; a relic of my youth.
3773,A BURIAL,It kept the rose of love in constant bloom
3774,A BURIAL,To see those eyes of earnestness and truth.
3775,A BURIAL,
3776,A BURIAL,"At hours wherein no other dared intrude,"
3777,A BURIAL,I had drawn comfort from its smiling grace.
3778,A BURIAL,"Silent companion of my solitude,"
3779,A BURIAL,My soul held sweet communion with that face.
3780,A BURIAL,
3781,A BURIAL,"I lived again the dream so bright, so brief,"
3782,A BURIAL,Though wakened as we all are by some Fate;
3783,A BURIAL,"This picture gave me infinite relief,"
3784,A BURIAL,And did not leave me wholly desolate.
3785,A BURIAL,
3786,A BURIAL,"To-day I saw an item, quite by chance,"
3787,A BURIAL,That robbed me of my pitiful poor dole:
3788,A BURIAL,"A marriage notice fell beneath my glance,"
3789,A BURIAL,And I became a lonely widowed soul.
3790,A BURIAL,
3791,A BURIAL,"With drooping eyes, and cheeks a burning flame,"
3792,A BURIAL,I turned the picture to the blank wall's gloom.
3793,A BURIAL,"My very heart had died in me of shame,"
3794,A BURIAL,If I had left it smiling in my room.
3795,A BURIAL,
3796,A BURIAL,"Another woman's husband.  So, my friend,"
3797,A BURIAL,"My comfort, my sole relic of the past,"
3798,A BURIAL,"I bury thee, and, lonely, seek the end."
3799,A BURIAL,Swift age has swept my youth from me at last.

3810,THEIR FACES,Come near to me that I may see thy faces.

3815,THEIR FACES,"That, even in sleep, my dreaming fancy sings."
3816,THEIR FACES,
3817,THEIR FACES,"Sometimes when seeing snow-white clouds at noon,"
3818,THEIR FACES,"Or watching silver shadows from the moon,"

3820,THEIR FACES,As if some kindred spirit lingered near.

3822,THEIR FACES,"Come closer, Angels! thou whose haloed wings"
3823,THEIR FACES,"Do gild for me the meanest ways and things,"

3826,THEIR FACES,
3827,THEIR FACES,O thought supreme!  O death!  O life! unknown
3828,THEIR FACES,I shall not solve thy mystery alone.
3829,THEIR FACES,The angels who have kissed me at my birth
3830,THEIR FACES,"Shall take again my soul when done with earth,"
3831,THEIR FACES,"And as we soar through vast, star-lighted spaces,"
3832,THEIR FACES,"At last, at last I shall behold their faces."

3840,THE LULLABY,"When the long day leans to the twilight,"
3841,THE LULLABY,"When the Evening star climbs to the moon,"
3842,THE LULLABY,"With a heart that is silently breaking,"
3843,THE LULLABY,I sit in the gloaming and croon.
3844,THE LULLABY,"I croon a low song for my darling,"
3845,THE LULLABY,"My wee one, my baby, my own;"
3846,THE LULLABY,"Who, cradled in rosewood and velvet,"
3847,THE LULLABY,Sleeps out in the churchyard alone.
3848,THE LULLABY,
3849,THE LULLABY,"Alone with no arms to enfold her,"
3850,THE LULLABY,"Alone with no pillowing breast,"
3851,THE LULLABY,"Alone with no hand on her cradle,"
3852,THE LULLABY,To rock her to soundlier rest.
3853,THE LULLABY,"But each day in the hush of the twilight,"
3854,THE LULLABY,Is silenced my broken heart's cry;
3855,THE LULLABY,"And I sit where I sat with my darling,"
3856,THE LULLABY,And sing her the old lullaby.
3857,THE LULLABY,
3858,THE LULLABY,"Oh! the dreams that come back to me mocking,"
3859,THE LULLABY,The sorrow that makes the days long;
3860,THE LULLABY,"As I sit in the twilight there rocking,"
3861,THE LULLABY,And singing that lullaby song.
3862,THE LULLABY,But I think my wee darling rests better
3863,THE LULLABY,"As the night shadows lengthen, and creep"
3864,THE LULLABY,"Across her low bed, in the churchyard,"
3865,THE LULLABY,If her mother's voice sings her to sleep.
3866,THE LULLABY,And so with a heart that is breaking
3867,THE LULLABY,I sing the old 'Lullaby dear'
3868,THE LULLABY,That hushed her so oft into slumber--
3869,THE LULLABY,O baby--my own--do you hear?

3878,MIRAGE,As lovely a sight as the eyes desire;
3879,MIRAGE,"When the leaves of the sumac bush are burning,"
3880,MIRAGE,Like the steady flame of a winter fire;
3881,MIRAGE,"When the weeds by the roadside all grow golden,"
3882,MIRAGE,"When maples are glowing and asters gleam,"
3883,MIRAGE,"It is then that the new is changed to the olden,"
3884,MIRAGE,And back to my heart comes the past like a dream.
3885,MIRAGE,
3886,MIRAGE,"Like a mirage I see the blue haze o'er me,"
3887,MIRAGE,The City of Youth that I left behind.
3888,MIRAGE,"Oh! whitely its turrets are gleaming before me,"
3889,MIRAGE,And out of the window lean faces kind.
3890,MIRAGE,And I hear the echo of jubilant voices;
3891,MIRAGE,There are cheeks of beauty and eyes of truth:
3892,MIRAGE,And every pulse in my heart rejoices--
3893,MIRAGE,There's no other place like the City of Youth.
3894,MIRAGE,
3895,MIRAGE,"And lo! the City is full of splendour,"
3896,MIRAGE,And a voice in my soul breaks into song.
3897,MIRAGE,"Yes, a passionate love, as fair as tender,"
3898,MIRAGE,Creeps out of the grave where it slept so long.
3899,MIRAGE,"As the strings of a harp by winds are shaken,"
3900,MIRAGE,"To endless music my heart is stirred,"
3901,MIRAGE,"When my name is breathed and my hand is taken,"
3902,MIRAGE,Though I cannot utter a single word.
3903,MIRAGE,
3904,MIRAGE,"But with souls that are full of the beautiful weather,"
3905,MIRAGE,"And the perfect peace that has no name,"
3906,MIRAGE,Under the autumn skies together
3907,MIRAGE,"We stray, by the sumacs all aflame."
3908,MIRAGE,And the forest flushes to fuller glory:
3909,MIRAGE,"Brighter glow asters and golden rod,"
3910,MIRAGE,"As eye unto eye tells the old, old story,"
3911,MIRAGE,And the sunlight seems like the smile of God.
3912,MIRAGE,
3913,MIRAGE,Alone I stand and sorrowful hearted;
3914,MIRAGE,The dead leaves fall in the chilly wind.
3915,MIRAGE,"The mirage is fled, and the glory departed,"
3916,MIRAGE,And the City of Youth is far behind.

3974,AN OLD BOUQUET,"Those faded leaves were as white as snow,"
3975,AN OLD BOUQUET,"With a background of green, to make them show,"

3978,AN OLD BOUQUET,They carried me back in a flash of light
3979,AN OLD BOUQUET,"To a perfumed, perfect summer night,"

4027,AT THE BRIDAL,He felt her icy breath;
4028,AT THE BRIDAL,And under the bride's warm clinging hand
4029,AT THE BRIDAL,There crept the touch of death.
4030,AT THE BRIDAL,
4031,AT THE BRIDAL,And above the low responses
4032,AT THE BRIDAL,There fell upon his ear
4033,AT THE BRIDAL,A voice forbidding the nuptial banns;
4034,AT THE BRIDAL,But no one else could hear.
4035,AT THE BRIDAL,
4036,AT THE BRIDAL,"And when the ring was given,"
4037,AT THE BRIDAL,"And when the prayer was said,"
4038,AT THE BRIDAL,"He knew, as he led his bride away,"
4039,AT THE BRIDAL,That he was not truly wed.
4040,AT THE BRIDAL,
4041,AT THE BRIDAL,"And while they sat at the banquet,"
4042,AT THE BRIDAL,"And mirth flowed like the wine,"
4043,AT THE BRIDAL,"A dead girl's voice hissed in his ear,"
4044,AT THE BRIDAL,"'You are not hers, but mine.'"
4045,AT THE BRIDAL,
4046,AT THE BRIDAL,"Oh! never beside his hearthstone,"
4047,AT THE BRIDAL,"And never in any place,"
4048,AT THE BRIDAL,Shall he be free from the haunting thought
4049,AT THE BRIDAL,Of that accusing face.
4050,AT THE BRIDAL,
4051,AT THE BRIDAL,

4054,BEST,BEST

4057,BEST,"In the gruesome night and the wintry weather,"
4058,BEST,"I watched two dear friends die,"
4059,BEST,And I buried them both in one grave together.
4060,BEST,Oh! who is so sad as I?
4061,BEST,"For the old love, and the old year,"
4062,BEST,They both have passed away;
4063,BEST,And I never can find the old cheer
4064,BEST,Come what will or may.
4065,BEST,
4066,BEST,I heard the bell in the tall church steeple
4067,BEST,Clang out a joyful strain.
4068,BEST,"And I thought, 'Of all the great world's people,"
4069,BEST,I have the bitterest pain.'
4070,BEST,"For the old year was a good year,"
4071,BEST,And the old love was sweet;
4072,BEST,And how could my heart hold any cheer
4073,BEST,When both lay dead at my feet.
4074,BEST,
4075,BEST,"Life may smile and the skies may brighten,"
4076,BEST,Winter will pass with its snows;
4077,BEST,Grief will wane and the burden lighten--
4078,BEST,And June will come with the rose.
4079,BEST,But it cannot bring the old cheer
4080,BEST,To fill my empty breast;
4081,BEST,"For the old year was the one year,"
4082,BEST,And the old love was best.
