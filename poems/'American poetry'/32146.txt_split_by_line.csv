190,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
191,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
192,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],It was a sultry day of summer time.
193,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],The sun pour'd down upon the ripen'd grain
194,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"With quivering heat, and the suspended leaves"
195,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Hung motionless. The cattle on the hills
196,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Stood still, and the divided flock were all"
197,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Laying their nostrils to the cooling roots,"
198,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And the sky look'd like silver, and it seem'd"
199,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"As if the air had fainted, and the pulse"
200,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Of nature had run down, and ceas'd to beat."
201,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
202,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"'Haste thee, my child!' the Syrian mother said,"
203,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],'Thy father is athirst'--and from the depths
204,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Of the cool well under the leaning tree,"
205,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"She drew refreshing water, and with thoughts"
206,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Of God's sweet goodness stirring at her heart,"
207,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"She bless'd her beautiful boy, and to his way"
208,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Committed him. And he went lightly on,"
209,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],With his soft hands press'd closely to the cool
210,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Stone vessel, and his little naked feet"
211,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Lifted with watchful care, and o'er the hills,"
212,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And thro' the light green hollows, where the lambs"
213,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Go for the tender grass, he kept his way,"
214,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Wiling its distance with his simple thoughts,"
215,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Till, in the wilderness of sheaves, with brows"
216,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Throbbing with heat, he set his burden down."
217,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
218,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Childhood is restless ever, and the boy"
219,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Stay'd not within the shadow of the tree,"
220,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],But with a joyous industry went forth
221,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Into the reapers' places, and bound up"
222,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"His tiny sheaves, and plaited cunningly"
223,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"The pliant withs out of the shining straw,"
224,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Cheering their labor on, till they forgot"
225,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],The very weariness of their stooping toil
226,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],In the beguiling of his earnest mirth.
227,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Presently he was silent, and his eye"
228,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Closed as with dizzy pain, and with his hand"
229,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Press'd hard upon his forehead, and his breast"
230,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Heaving with the suppression of a cry,"
231,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"He uttered a faint murmur, and fell back"
232,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Upon the loosen'd sheaf, insensible."
233,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
234,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"They bore him to his mother, and he lay"
235,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Upon her knees till noon--and then he died!
236,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"She had watch'd every breath, and kept her hand"
237,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Soft on his forehead, and gaz'd in upon"
238,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"The dreamy languor of his listless eye,"
239,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And she had laid back all his sunny curls,"
240,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And kiss'd his delicate lip, and lifted him"
241,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Into her bosom, till her heart grew strong--"
242,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],His beauty was so unlike death! She leaned
243,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Over him now, that she might catch the low"
244,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Sweet music of his breath, that she had learn'd"
245,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],To love when he was slumbering at her side
246,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],In his unconscious infancy--
247,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"--""So still!"
248,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"'Tis a soft sleep! How beautiful he lies,"
249,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"With his fair forehead, and the rosy veins"
250,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Playing so freshly in his sunny cheek!
251,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],How could they say that he would die! Oh God!
252,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],I could not lose him! I have treasured all
253,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"His childhood in my heart, and even now,"
254,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"As he has slept, my memory has been there,"
255,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Counting like ingots all his winning ways--
256,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],His unforgotten sweetness--
257,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"--""Yet so still!--"
258,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],How like this breathless slumber is to death!
259,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],I could believe that in that bosom now
260,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],There were no pulse--it beats so languidly!
261,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],I cannot see it stir; but his red lip!--
262,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Death would not be so very beautiful!
263,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],And that half smile--would death have left _that_ there?
264,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],--And should I not have felt that he would die?
265,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],And have I not wept over him?--and prayed
266,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Morning and night for him?--and _could_ he die?
267,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],--No--God will keep him. He will be my pride
268,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Many long years to come, and this fair hair"
269,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Will darken like his father's, and his eye"
270,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Be of a deeper blue when he is grown;
271,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And he will be so tall, and I shall look"
272,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"With such a pride upon him!--_He_ to die!"""
273,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And the fond mother lifted his soft curls,"
274,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And smiled, as if 'twere mockery to think"
275,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],That such fair things could perish--
276,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],--Suddenly
277,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Her hand shrunk from him, and the color fled"
278,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"From her fix'd lip, and her supporting knees"
279,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Were shook beneath her child. Her hand had touch'd
280,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"His forehead, as she dallied with his hair--"
281,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],And it was cold--like clay!--slow--very slow
282,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Came the misgiving that her child was dead.
283,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],She sat a moment and her eyes were clos'd
284,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"In a still prayer for strength, and then she took"
285,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],His little hand and press'd it earnestly--
286,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],And put her lip to his--and look'd again
287,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Fearfully on him--and then, bending low,"
288,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"She whisper'd in his ear, ""My son!--My son!"""
289,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And as the echo died, and not a sound"
290,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Broke on the stillness, and he lay there still,"
291,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Motionless on her knee--the truth _would_ come!
292,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"And with a sharp, quick cry, as if her heart"
293,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Were crush'd, she lifted him and held him close"
294,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Into her bosom--with a mother's thought--
295,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],As if death had no power to touch him there!
296,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
297,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],*       *       *       *       *
298,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
299,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"The man of God came forth, and led the child"
300,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Unto his mother, and went on his way."
301,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],And he was there--her beautiful--her own--
302,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Living and smiling on her--with his arms
303,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Folded about her neck, and his warm breath"
304,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"Breathing upon her lips, and in her ear"
305,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],The music of his gentle voice once more!
306,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],
307,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],Oh for a burning word that would express
308,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],"The measure of a mother's holy joy,"
309,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],When God has given back to her her child
310,THE SHUNAMITE.[A],From death's dark portal! It surpasseth words.

322,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,And the deep silence which subdues the breath
323,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Like a strong feeling, hung upon the world"
324,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,As sleep upon the pulses of a child.
325,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"'Twas the last watch of night. Gethsemane,"
326,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"With its bath'd leaves of silver, seem'd dissolv'd"
327,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"In visible stillness, and as Jesus' voice"
328,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,With its bewildering sweetness met the ear
329,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Of his disciples, it vibrated on"
330,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,Like the first whisper in a silent world.
331,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,They came on slowly. Heaviness oppress'd
332,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"The Saviour's heart, and when the kindnesses"

334,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Of near communion, for his gift of strength"
335,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,Was wasted by the spirit's weariness.
336,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"He left them there, and went a little on,"
337,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"And in the depth of that hush'd silentness,"
338,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Alone with God, he fell upon his face,"
339,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,And as his heart was broken with the rush
340,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Of his surpassing agony, and death,"
341,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Wrung to him from a dying universe,"
342,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Were mightier than the Son of man could bear,"

347,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Like the forc'd drop before the fountain breaks,"

349,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,The Saviour felt its quiet in his soul;
350,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"And though his strength was weakness, and the light"
351,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Which led him on till now was sorely dim,"

354,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Voices were heard in heaven, and music stole"

356,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,As if the stars were swept like instruments.
357,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"No cloud was visible, but radiant wings"

361,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,Whose fountain is the mystery of God
362,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Encalm'd within his eye, bow'd down to him,"
363,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,And nerv'd him with a ministry of strength.
364,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,It was enough--and with his godlike brow
365,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"Re-written, of his Father's messenger,"
366,SCENE IN GETHSEMANE.,"With meekness, whose divinity is more"

379,CONTEMPLATION.,Searching the pearly depths through which they spring
380,CONTEMPLATION.,"Like beautiful creations, till I feel"
381,CONTEMPLATION.,"As if it were a new and perfect world,"
382,CONTEMPLATION.,Waiting in silence for the word of God
383,CONTEMPLATION.,"To breathe it into motion. There they stand,"
384,CONTEMPLATION.,"Shining in order, like a living hymn"
385,CONTEMPLATION.,"Written in light, awaking at the breath"

387,CONTEMPLATION.,"Who made them, with the harmony of spheres."
388,CONTEMPLATION.,I would I had an angel's ear to list

390,CONTEMPLATION.,"Up in that boundless element, and feel"
391,CONTEMPLATION.,"Its ravishing vibrations, like a pulse"
392,CONTEMPLATION.,Beating in heaven! My spirit is athirst
393,CONTEMPLATION.,For music--rarer music! I would bathe

402,CONTEMPLATION.,Thus mused Alethe. She was one to whom
403,CONTEMPLATION.,"Life had been like the witching of a dream,"
404,CONTEMPLATION.,Of an untroubled sweetness. She was born
405,CONTEMPLATION.,"Of a high race, and laid upon the knee,"
406,CONTEMPLATION.,With her soft eye perusing listlessly
407,CONTEMPLATION.,"The fretted roof, or, on Mosaic floors,"
408,CONTEMPLATION.,"Grasped at the tessellated squares, inwrought"
409,CONTEMPLATION.,With metals curiously. Her childhood pass'd
410,CONTEMPLATION.,Like faery--amid fountains and green haunts--
411,CONTEMPLATION.,Trying her little feet upon a lawn
412,CONTEMPLATION.,"Of velvet evenness, and hiding flowers"
413,CONTEMPLATION.,"In her sweet bosom, as it were a fair"
414,CONTEMPLATION.,And pearly altar to crush incense on.
415,CONTEMPLATION.,Her youth--oh! that was queenly! She was like
416,CONTEMPLATION.,A dream of poetry that may not be
417,CONTEMPLATION.,Written or told--exceeding beautiful!
418,CONTEMPLATION.,"And so came worshippers; and rank bow'd down,"
419,CONTEMPLATION.,"And breathed upon her heart, as with a breath"
420,CONTEMPLATION.,"Of pride, and bound her forehead gorgeously"
421,CONTEMPLATION.,"With dazzling scorn, and gave unto her step"
422,CONTEMPLATION.,"A majesty as if she trod the sea,"
423,CONTEMPLATION.,"And the proud waves, unbidden, lifted her."
424,CONTEMPLATION.,And so she grew to woman--her mere look
425,CONTEMPLATION.,"Strong as a monarch's signet, and her hand"
426,CONTEMPLATION.,The ambition of a kingdom.
427,CONTEMPLATION.,
428,CONTEMPLATION.,From all this
429,CONTEMPLATION.,"Turn'd her high heart away! She had a mind,"
430,CONTEMPLATION.,"Deep and immortal, and it would not feed"
431,CONTEMPLATION.,On pageantry. She thirsted for a spring
432,CONTEMPLATION.,"Of a serener element, and drank"
433,CONTEMPLATION.,"Philosophy, and for a little while"
434,CONTEMPLATION.,"She was allay'd--till, presently, it turn'd"
435,CONTEMPLATION.,"Bitter within her, and her spirit grew"
436,CONTEMPLATION.,Faint for undying waters.
437,CONTEMPLATION.,
438,CONTEMPLATION.,Then she came
439,CONTEMPLATION.,To the pure fount of God--and is athirst
440,CONTEMPLATION.,"No more--save when the ""fever of the world"""

452,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Vividly in my mind, as if he went"
453,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,From me but yesterday--its pleasant smile
454,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And the rich, joyous laughter of his eye,"
455,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And the free play of his unhaughty lip,"
456,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"So redolent of his heart! He was not fair,"
457,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Nor singular, nor over-fond of books,"
458,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,And never melancholy when alone.
459,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"He was the heartiest in the ring, the last"
460,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Home from the summer's wanderings, and the first"
461,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Over the threshold when the school was done.
462,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,All of us loved him. We shall speak his name
463,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"In the far years to come, and think of him"
464,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"When we have lost life's simplest passages,"
465,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,And pray for him--forgetting he is dead--
466,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Life was in him so passing beautiful!
467,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,
468,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,His childhood had been wasted in the close
469,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,And airless city. He had never thought
470,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"That the blue sky was ample, or the stars"
471,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Many in heaven, or the chainless wind"
472,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Of a medicinal freshness. He had learn'd
473,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Perilous tricks of manhood, and his hand"
474,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Was ready, and his confidence in himself"
475,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Bold as a quarreller's. Then he came away
476,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"To the unshelter'd hills, and brought an eye"
477,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"New as a babe's to nature, and an ear"
478,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,As ignorant of its music. He was sad.
479,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"The broad hill sides seem'd desolate, and the woods"
480,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Gloomy and dim, and the perpetual sound"
481,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Of wind and waters and unquiet leaves
482,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Like the monotony of a dirge. He pined
483,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,For the familiar things until his heart
484,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Sicken'd for home!--and so he stole away
485,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"To the most silent places, and lay down"
486,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"To weep upon the mosses of the slopes,"
487,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And follow'd listlessly the silver streams,"
488,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Till he found out the unsunn'd shadowings,"
489,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And the green openings to the sky, and grew"
490,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Fond of them all insensibly. He found
491,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Sweet company in the brooks, and loved to sit"
492,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And bathe his fingers wantonly, and feel"
493,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,The wind upon his forehead; and the leaves
494,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Took a beguiling whisper to his ear,"
495,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And the bird-voices music, and the blast"
496,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Swept like an instrument the sounding trees.
497,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,His heart went back to its simplicity
498,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,As the stirr'd waters in the night grow pure--
499,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Sadness and silence and the dim-lit woods
500,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Won on his love so well--and he forgot
501,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"His pride and his assumingness, and lost"
502,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"The mimicry of the man, and so unlearn'd"
503,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,His very character till he became
504,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,As diffident as a girl.
505,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,'Tis very strange
506,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,How nature sometimes wins upon a child.
507,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Th' experience of the world is not on him,"
508,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,And poetry has not upon his brain
509,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Left a mock thirst for solitude, nor love"
510,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Writ on his forehead the effeminate shame
511,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Which hideth from men's eyes. He has a full,"
512,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Shadowless heart, and it is always toned"
513,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,More merrily than the chastened voice of winds
514,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And waters--yet he often, in his mirth,"
515,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Stops by the running brooks, and suddenly"
516,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Loiters, he knows not why, and at the sight"
517,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Of the spread meadows and the lifted hills
518,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Feels an unquiet pleasure, and forgets"
519,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,To listen for his fellows. He will grow
520,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Fond of the early star, and lie awake"
521,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Gazing with many thoughts upon the moon,"
522,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,And lose himself in the deep chamber'd sky
523,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,With his untaught philosophies. It breeds
524,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Sadness in older hearts, but not in his;"
525,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And he goes merrier to his play, and shouts"
526,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Louder the joyous call--but it will sink
527,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Into his memory like his mother's prayer,"
528,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,For after years to brood on.
529,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Cheerful thoughts
530,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Came to the homesick boy as he became

532,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And he came oftener to our noisy play,"
533,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,Cheering us on with his delightful shout
534,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Over the hills, and giving interest"
535,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,With his keen spirit to the boyish game.
536,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"We loved him for his carelessness of himself,"
537,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And his perpetual mirth, and tho' he stole"
538,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Sometimes away into the woods alone,"
539,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,And wandered unaccompanied when the night
540,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"Was beautiful, he was our idol still,"
541,SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW.,"And we have not forgotten him, tho' time"

553,IDLENESS.,"Fitfully on the skylight, and the shade"
554,IDLENESS.,Of the fast flying clouds across my book
555,IDLENESS.,Passes with delicate change. My merry fire
556,IDLENESS.,Sings cheerfully to itself; my musing cat
557,IDLENESS.,"Purrs as she wakes from her unquiet sleep,"

559,IDLENESS.,Like me the gentle influence of the rain.
560,IDLENESS.,"Here have I sat since morn, reading sometimes,"
561,IDLENESS.,And sometimes listening to the faster fall
562,IDLENESS.,"Of the large drops, or rising with the stir"
563,IDLENESS.,"Of an unbidden thought, have walked awhile"
564,IDLENESS.,"With the slow steps of indolence, my room,"
565,IDLENESS.,And then sat down composedly again
566,IDLENESS.,To my quaint book of olden poetry.
567,IDLENESS.,"It is a kind of idleness, I know;"
568,IDLENESS.,And I am said to be an idle man--
569,IDLENESS.,And it is very true. I love to go

572,IDLENESS.,Each with its gay or busy interest;
573,IDLENESS.,"And then I muse upon their lot, and read"

575,IDLENESS.,"And so grow kind of heart, as if the sight"
576,IDLENESS.,Of human beings were humanity.
577,IDLENESS.,"And I am better after it, and go"
578,IDLENESS.,"More gratefully to my rest, and feel a love"
579,IDLENESS.,"Stirring my heart to every living thing,"
580,IDLENESS.,"And my low prayer has more humility,"

584,IDLENESS.,I love to go and mingle with the young
585,IDLENESS.,In the gay festal room--when every heart
586,IDLENESS.,"Is beating faster than the merry tune,"
587,IDLENESS.,"And their blue eyes are restless, and their lips"
588,IDLENESS.,"Parted with eager joy, and their round cheeks"
589,IDLENESS.,Flushed with the beautiful motion of the dance.
590,IDLENESS.,"'Tis sweet, in the becoming light of lamps,"
591,IDLENESS.,"To watch a brow half shaded, or a curl"
592,IDLENESS.,"Playing upon a neck capriciously,"
593,IDLENESS.,"Or, unobserved, to watch in its delight,"
594,IDLENESS.,The earnest countenance of a child. I love
595,IDLENESS.,"To look upon such things, and I can go"
596,IDLENESS.,"Back to my solitude, and dream bright dreams"
597,IDLENESS.,"For their fast coming years, and speak of them"
598,IDLENESS.,"Earnestly in my prayer, till I am glad"
599,IDLENESS.,"With a benevolent joy--and this, I know,"
600,IDLENESS.,"To the world's eye, is only idleness!"
601,IDLENESS.,
602,IDLENESS.,"And when the clouds pass suddenly away,"
603,IDLENESS.,"And the blue sky is like a newer world,"
604,IDLENESS.,"And the sweet growing things--forest and flower,"
605,IDLENESS.,Humble and beautiful alike--are all
606,IDLENESS.,Breathing up odors to the very heaven--
607,IDLENESS.,Or when the frost has yielded to the sun
608,IDLENESS.,"In the rich autumn, and the filmy mist"
609,IDLENESS.,"Lies like a silver lining on the sky,"
610,IDLENESS.,"And the clear air exhilarates, and life"
611,IDLENESS.,"Simply, is luxury--and when the hush"
612,IDLENESS.,"Of twilight, like a gentle sleep, steals on,"
613,IDLENESS.,"And the birds settle to their nests, and stars"
614,IDLENESS.,"Spring in the upper sky, and there is not"
615,IDLENESS.,A sound that is not low and musical--
616,IDLENESS.,At all these pleasant seasons I go out
617,IDLENESS.,"With my first impulse guiding me, and take"
618,IDLENESS.,"Woodpath, or stream, or sunny mountain side,"
619,IDLENESS.,"And, in my recklessness of heart, stray on,"
620,IDLENESS.,"Glad with the birds, and silent with the leaves,"

624,IDLENESS.,"And I should love to go up to the sky,"
625,IDLENESS.,"And course the heaven like stars, and float away"
626,IDLENESS.,Upon the gliding clouds that have no stay
627,IDLENESS.,In their swift journey--and 'twould be a joy
628,IDLENESS.,"To walk the chambers of the deep, and tread"
629,IDLENESS.,"The pearls of its untrodden floor, and know"
630,IDLENESS.,The tribes of its unfathomable depths--
631,IDLENESS.,Dwellers beneath the pressure of a sea!
632,IDLENESS.,And I should love to issue with the wind
633,IDLENESS.,"On a strong errand, and o'ersweep the earth,"
634,IDLENESS.,"With its broad continents and islands green,"

692,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,
693,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,'Twas a rich night in June. The air was all
694,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Fragrance and balm, and the wet leaves were stirred"
695,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"By the soft fingers of the southern wind,"
696,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"And caught the light capriciously, like wings"
697,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Haunting the greenwood with a silvery sheen.
698,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"The stars might not be numbered, and the moon"
699,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Exceeding beautiful, went up in heaven,"
700,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"And took her place in silence, and a hush,"
701,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Like the deep Sabbath of the night, came down"
702,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,And rested upon nature. I was out
703,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"With three sweet sisters wandering, and my thoughts"
704,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Took color of the moonlight, and of them,"
705,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"And I was calm and happy. Their deep tones,"
706,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Low in the stillness, and by that soft air"
707,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Melted to reediness, bore out, like song,"
708,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"The language of high feelings, and I felt"
709,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,How excellent is woman when she gives
710,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,To the fine pulses of her spirit way.
711,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"One was a noble being, with a brow"
712,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Ample and pure, and on it her black hair"
713,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Was parted, like a raven's wing on snow."
714,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Her tone was low and sweet, and in her smile"
715,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,You read intense affections. Her moist eye
716,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Had a most rare benignity; her mouth,"
717,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Bland and unshadowed sweetness; and her face
718,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Was full of that mild dignity that gives
719,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,A holiness to woman. She was one
720,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Whose virtues blossom daily, and pour out"
721,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,A fragrance upon all who in her path
722,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Have a blest fellowship. I longed to be
723,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Her brother, that her hand might lie upon"
724,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"My forehead, and her gentle voice allay"
725,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,The fever that is at my heart sometimes.
726,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,
727,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,There was a second sister who might witch
728,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,An angel from his hymn. I cannot tell
729,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,The secret of her beauty. It is more
730,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Than her slight penciled lip, and her arch eye"
731,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Laughing beneath its lashes, as if life"
732,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Were nothing but a merry mask; 'tis more
733,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Than motion, though she moveth like a fay;"
734,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Or music, though her voice is like a reed"
735,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Blown by a low south wind; or cunning grace,"
736,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Though all she does is beautiful; or thought,"
737,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Or fancy, or a delicate sense, though mind"
738,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Is her best gift, and poetry her world,"
739,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,And she will see strange beauty in a flower
740,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,As by a subtle vision. I care not
741,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,To know how she bewitches; 'tis enough
742,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,For me that I can listen to her voice
743,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"And dream rare dreams of music, or converse"
744,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Upon unwrit philosophy, till I"
745,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Am wildered beneath thoughts I cannot bound
746,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,And the red lip that breathes them.
747,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,On my arm
748,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Leaned an unshadowed girl, who scarcely yet"
749,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Had numbered fourteen summers. I know not
750,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,How I shall draw her picture--the young heart
751,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Has such a restlessness of change, and each"
752,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Of its wild moods so lovely! I can see
753,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Her figure in its rounded beauty now,"
754,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"With her half-flying step, her clustering hair"
755,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Bathing a neck like Hebe's, and her face"
756,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,By a glad heart made radiant. She was full
757,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Of the romance of girlhood. The fair world
758,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Was like an unmarred Eden to her eye,"
759,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"And every sound was music, and the tint"
760,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Of every cloud a silent poetry.
761,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Light to thy path, bright creature! I would charm"
762,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Thy being if I could, that it should be"
763,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Ever as now thou dreamest, and flow on"
764,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Thus innocent and beautiful to heaven!
765,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,We walked beneath the full and mellow moon
766,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Till the late stars had risen. It was not
767,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"In silence, though we did not seem to break"
768,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,The hush with our low voices; but our thoughts
769,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,Stirred deeply at their sources; and when night
770,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Divided us, I slumbered with a peace"
771,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Floating about my heart, which only comes"
772,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,From high communion. I shall never see
773,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,That silver moon again without a crowd
774,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Of gentle memories, and a silent prayer,"
775,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,That when the night of life shall oversteal
776,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,"Your sky, ye lovely sisters! there may be"
777,THE TRI-PORTRAIT.,A light as beautiful to lead you on.

1409,MERE ACCIDENT.,"Here did I win thee, Viola! We came--"
1410,MERE ACCIDENT.,Thou knowest how carelessly--and never thought
1411,MERE ACCIDENT.,Love lived in such a wilderness; and thou--
1412,MERE ACCIDENT.,"I had a cousin's kindness for thy lip,"

1437,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1438,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,I had a passion when I was a child
1439,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"For a most pleasant idleness. In June,"
1440,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,When the thick masses of the leaves were stirr'd
1441,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"With a just audible murmur, and the streams"
1442,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Fainted in their cool places to a low
1443,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Unnotic'd tinkle, and the reapers hung"
1444,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Their sickles in the trees and went to sleep,"
1445,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Then might you find me in an antique chair
1446,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Cushion'd with cunning luxury, which stood"
1447,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"In the old study corner, by a nook"
1448,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Crowded with volumes of the old romance;
1449,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And there, the long and quiet summer day,"
1450,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Lay I with half clos'd eyelids, turning o'er"
1451,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Leaf after leaf, until the twilight blurr'd"
1452,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Their singular and time-stain'd characters.
1453,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"'Twas a forgetful lore, and it is blent"
1454,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"With dreams that in my fitful slumber came,"
1455,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,And is remember'd faintly. But to-day
1456,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"With the strange waywardness of human thought,"
1457,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,A story has come back to me which I
1458,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Had long forgotten, and I tell it now"
1459,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Because it hath a savour that I find
1460,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,But seldom in the temper of the world.
1461,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1462,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Angelo turn'd away. He was a poor
1463,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Unhonor'd minstrel, and he might not breathe"
1464,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Love to the daughter of an Earl. She rais'd
1465,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Proudly her beautiful head, and shook away"
1466,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"From her clear temples the luxuriant hair,"
1467,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,And told him it would ever please her well
1468,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"To listen to his minstrelsy, but love"
1469,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Was for a loftier lip--and then the tear
1470,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Stole to her flashing eye, for as she spoke"
1471,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"There rose up a remembrance of his keen,"
1472,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Unstooping spirit, and his noble heart"
1473,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Given her like a sacrifice, and she held"
1474,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Her hand for him to kiss, and said, ""Farewell!"
1475,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Think of me, Angelo!"" and so pass'd on."
1476,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1477,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"The color to his forehead mounted high,"
1478,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And his thin lip curl'd haughtily, and then"
1479,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"As if his mood had chang'd, he bow'd his head"
1480,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Low on his bosom, and remain'd awhile"
1481,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Lost in his bitter thoughts--and then again
1482,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"He lifted to its height his slender form,"
1483,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And his moist eye grew clear, and his hand pass'd"
1484,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Rapidly o'er his instrument while thus
1485,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,He gave his spirit voice:--
1486,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1487,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"It did not need that alter'd look,"
1488,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Nor that uplifted brow--
1489,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"I had not ask'd thy haughty love,"

1491,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,My love was like a beating heart--
1492,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Unbidden and unstayed;
1493,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And had I known but half its power,"
1494,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,It had not been betray'd.
1495,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1496,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,I did not seek thy titled hand;
1497,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,I thought not of thy name;
1498,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,I only granted utterance
1499,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,To one wild thought of flame.
1500,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"I did not dream thou couldst be mine,"
1501,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Or I a thought to thee--
1502,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,I only knew my lip must let
1503,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Some burning thought go free.
1504,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1505,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"I lov'd thee for thy high born grace,"

1513,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1514,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,And are they not all thine? still thine?
1515,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Is not thy heart as true?
1516,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Holds not thy step its noble grace--
1517,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Thy cheek its dainty hue?
1518,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,And have I not an ear to hear--
1519,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,A cloudless eye to see--
1520,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And a thirst for beautiful human thought,"
1521,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,That first was stirr'd with thee?
1522,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1523,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Then why should I turn from thee now?
1524,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,Why should not I love on--
1525,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"Dreaming of thee by night, by day,"
1526,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,As I have ever done?
1527,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"My service shall be still as leal,"
1528,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,My love as quenchless burn
1529,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,It shames me of my selfish thought
1530,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,That dream'd of a return!
1531,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,
1532,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,He married her! Perhaps it spoils the tale--
1533,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"But she had listen'd to his song, unseen,"
1534,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And kept it in her heart, and, by and by,"
1535,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"When Angelo did service for his king,"
1536,THE EARL'S MINSTREL.,"And was prefer'd to honor, she betray'd"

2249,MAY.,The lilac has a load of balm
2250,MAY.,"For every wind that stirs,"
2251,MAY.,And the larch stands green and beautiful
2252,MAY.,Amid the sombre firs.
2253,MAY.,
2254,MAY.,There's perfume upon every wind--
2255,MAY.,Music in every tree--
2256,MAY.,Dews for the moisture-loving flowers--
2257,MAY.,Sweets for the sucking bee;
2258,MAY.,"The sick come forth for the healing South,"
2259,MAY.,The young are gathering flowers;
2260,MAY.,"And life is a tale of poetry,"
2261,MAY.,That is told by golden hours.
2262,MAY.,
2263,MAY.,"If 'tis not a true philosophy,"
2264,MAY.,That the spirit when set free
2265,MAY.,"Still lingers about its olden home,"
2266,MAY.,"In the flower and the tree,"
2267,MAY.,It is very strange that our pulses thrill
2268,MAY.,"At the tint of a voiceless thing,"
2269,MAY.,And our hearts yearn so with tenderness
2270,MAY.,In the beautiful time of Spring.

2311,FOR A BALL.,And that slow look that seems to stray
2312,FOR A BALL.,As each sweet feature made it stay--
2313,FOR A BALL.,"And that small finger, lightly laid"
2314,FOR A BALL.,"On dimpled cheek and glossy braid,"
2315,FOR A BALL.,As if to know that all they seem
2316,FOR A BALL.,"Is really there, and not a dream--"

2334,TO A BELLE.,"For my eye doth see, and my ear doth hear,"
2335,TO A BELLE.,And my heart is not of steel;
2336,TO A BELLE.,I meet thee in the festal hall--
2337,TO A BELLE.,I turn thee in the dance--
2338,TO A BELLE.,"And I wait, as would a worshipper,"
2339,TO A BELLE.,The giving of thy glance.
2340,TO A BELLE.,
2341,TO A BELLE.,Thy beauty is as undenied

2358,TO A BELLE.,
2359,TO A BELLE.,I know all this--I feel all this--
2360,TO A BELLE.,And my heart believes it true;
2361,TO A BELLE.,"And my fancy hath often borne me on,"

2363,TO A BELLE.,"And I have a heart, that is strong and deep,"
2364,TO A BELLE.,"And would love with its human all,"
2365,TO A BELLE.,"And it waits for a fetter that's sweet to wear,"
2366,TO A BELLE.,And would bound to a silken thrall.
2367,TO A BELLE.,
2368,TO A BELLE.,But it loves not thee.--It would sooner bind
2369,TO A BELLE.,Its thoughts to the open sky;
2370,TO A BELLE.,"It would worship as soon a familiar star,"
2371,TO A BELLE.,That is bright to every eye.

2382,TO A BELLE.,And worshippers leave thy shrine--
2383,TO A BELLE.,"My love were, then, but a gift for thee,"
