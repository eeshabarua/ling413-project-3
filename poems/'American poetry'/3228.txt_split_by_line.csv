43,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,LOVE’S LANGUAGE
44,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,
45,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,
46,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"When silence flees before the voice of Love,"
47,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,Of what expression does that god approve?
48,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"Is dulcet song or flowing verse his choice,"
49,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"Or stately prose, made regal by his voice?"
50,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"Speaks Love in couplets, or in epics grand?"
51,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"And is Love humble, or does he command?"
52,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,
53,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,There is no language that Love does not speak:
54,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"To-day commanding and to-morrow meek,"
55,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"One hour laconic and the next verbose,"
56,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"With hope triumphant and with doubt morose,"
57,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,His varying moods all forms of speech employ.
58,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"To give expression to his painful joy,"
59,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,
60,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"To voice the phases of his joyful pain,"
61,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,He rings the changes on the poet’s strain.
62,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"Yet not in epic, epigram or verse"
63,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,Can Love the passion of his heart rehearse.
64,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,"All speech, all language, is inadequate,"
65,LOVE’S LANGUAGE,There are no words with Love commensurate.

178,THE LAND BETWEEN,
179,THE LAND BETWEEN,
180,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Between the little Here and larger Yonder,"
181,THE LAND BETWEEN,There is a realm (or so one day I read)
182,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Where faithful spirits love-enchained may wander,"
183,THE LAND BETWEEN,Till some remembering soul from earth has fled.
184,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Then, reunited, they go forth afar,"
185,THE LAND BETWEEN,"From sphere to sphere, where wondrous angels are."
186,THE LAND BETWEEN,
187,THE LAND BETWEEN,Not many spirits in that realm are waiting;
188,THE LAND BETWEEN,Not many pause upon its shores to rest;
189,THE LAND BETWEEN,"For only love, intense and unabating,"
190,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Can hold them from the longer, higher quest."
191,THE LAND BETWEEN,"And after grief has wept itself to sleep,"
192,THE LAND BETWEEN,Few hearts on earth their vital memories keep.
193,THE LAND BETWEEN,
194,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Should I pass on, across the mystic border,"
195,THE LAND BETWEEN,Let thy love link me to that pallid land;
196,THE LAND BETWEEN,I would not seek the heavens of finer order
197,THE LAND BETWEEN,Until thy barque had left this coarser strand.
198,THE LAND BETWEEN,"How desolate such journeyings would be,"
199,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Though straight to Him, were they not shared by thee."
200,THE LAND BETWEEN,
201,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Wert thou first called (dear God, how could I bear it?)"
202,THE LAND BETWEEN,"I should enchain thee with my love, I know."
203,THE LAND BETWEEN,Not great enough am I to free thy spirit
204,THE LAND BETWEEN,"From all these tender ties, and bid thee go."
205,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Nor would a soul, unselfish as thine own,"
206,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Forget so soon, and speed to heaven alone."
207,THE LAND BETWEEN,
208,THE LAND BETWEEN,On earth we find no joy in ways diverging;
209,THE LAND BETWEEN,How could we find it in the worlds unseen?
210,THE LAND BETWEEN,"I know old memories from my bosom surging,"
211,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Would keep thee waiting in that Land Between,"
212,THE LAND BETWEEN,"Until together, side by side, we trod"
213,THE LAND BETWEEN,"A path of stars, in our great search for God."

220,LOVE’S MIRAGE,
221,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"Midway upon the route, he paused athirst"
222,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"And suddenly across the wastes of heat,"
223,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"He saw cool waters gleaming, and a sweet"
224,LOVE’S MIRAGE,Green oasis upon his vision burst.
225,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"A tender dream, long in his bosom nursed,"
226,LOVE’S MIRAGE,Spread love’s illusive verdure for his feet;
227,LOVE’S MIRAGE,The barren sands changed into golden wheat;
228,LOVE’S MIRAGE,The way grew glad that late had seemed accursed.
229,LOVE’S MIRAGE,
230,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"She shone, the woman wonder, on his soul;"
231,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"The garden spot, for which men toil and wait;"
232,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"The house of rest, that is each heart’s demand;"
233,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"But when, at last, he reached the gleaming goal,"
234,LOVE’S MIRAGE,"He found, oh, cruel irony of fate,"
235,LOVE’S MIRAGE,But desert sun upon the desert sand.

240,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,THE NEED OF THE WORLD
241,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,
242,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,
243,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"I know the need of the world,"
244,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,Though it would not have me know.
245,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"It would hide its sorrow deep,"
246,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,Where only God may go.
247,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,Yet its secret it can not keep;
248,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"It tells it awake, or asleep,"
249,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"It tells it to all who will heed,"
250,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,And he who runs may read.
251,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,The need of the world I know.
252,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,
253,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"I know the need of the world,"
254,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"When it boasts of its wealth the loudest,"
255,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"When it flaunts it in all men’s eyes,"
256,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,When its mien is the gayest and proudest.
257,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,"Oh! ever it lies—it lies,"
258,THE NEED OF THE WORLD,For the sound of its laughter dies

722,MAIDEN,
723,MAIDEN,Who knocks upon my door?
724,MAIDEN,
725,MAIDEN,_A Voice Outside_
726,MAIDEN,
727,MAIDEN,"’Tis I, your fate!"
728,MAIDEN,
729,MAID,MAID
730,MAID,
731,MAID,"Thou dost deceive, not me, but thine own self."
732,MAID,"My fate is not a wandering, vagrant elf."
733,MAID,"My fate is here, within this throbbing heart"
734,MAID,"That beats alone for glory, and for art."

737,MAID,
738,MAID,[_Another knock at door_.]
739,MAID,
740,MAID,"Pray, let me in; I am so faint and cold."
741,MAID,
742,MAID,"[_Door is pushed ajar_.  _Enter_ CUPID, _who approaches the fire with"
743,MAID,outstretched hands_.]
744,MAID,
745,MAID,MAID (_indignantly_)
746,MAID,
747,MAID,"Methinks thou art not faint, however cold,"
748,MAID,"But rather too courageous, and most bold;"
749,MAID,"Surprisingly ill-mannered, sir, and rude,"
750,MAID,Without an invitation to intrude
751,MAID,Into my very presence.
752,MAID,
753,MAID,CUPID (_warming his hands_)
754,MAID,
755,MAID,"But, you see,"
756,MAID,Girls never mind a little chap like me.
757,MAID,"They’re always watching for me on the sly,"
758,MAID,And hoping I will call.
759,MAID,
760,MAID,MAID (_haughtily_)
761,MAID,
762,MAID,"Indeed, not I!"
763,MAID,"My heart has listened to a sweeter voice,"
764,MAID,A clarion call that gives command—not choice.
765,MAID,"And I have answered to that call, ‘I come’;"
766,MAID,To other voices shall my ears be dumb.
767,MAID,To art alone I consecrate my life—
768,MAID,"Art is my spouse, and I his willing wife."
769,MAID,
770,MAID,"CUPID (_slowly_, _gazing in the grate_)"
771,MAID,
772,MAID,"Art is a sultan, and you must divide"
773,MAID,His love with many another ill-fed bride.
774,MAID,Now I know one who worships you alone.
775,MAID,
776,MAID,MAID (_impatiently_)
777,MAID,
778,MAID,I will not listen! for the dice is thrown
779,MAID,And art has won me.  On my brow some day
780,MAID,Shall rest the laurel wreath—
781,MAID,
782,MAID,CUPID (_sitting down and looking at_ MAID _critically_)
783,MAID,
784,MAID,Just let me say
785,MAID,I think sweet orange blossoms under lace
786,MAID,Are better suited to your type of face.
787,MAID,
788,MAID,MAID (_ignoring interruption_)
789,MAID,
790,MAID,I yet shall stand before an audience
791,MAID,"That listens as one mind, absorbed, intense,"
792,MAID,"And with my genius I shall rouse its cheers,"
793,MAID,"Still it to silence, soften it to tears,"
794,MAID,"Or wake its laughter.  Oh, the play! the play!"
795,MAID,"The play’s the thing!  My boy, _the play_!!"
796,MAID,
797,MAID,CUPID (_suddenly clapping his hands_)
798,MAID,
799,MAID,"Oh, say!"
800,MAID,"I know a splendid role for you to take,"
801,MAID,And one that always keeps the house awake—
802,MAID,"And calls for pretty dressing.  Oh, it’s great!"
803,MAID,
804,MAID,MAID (_excitedly_)
805,MAID,
806,MAID,"Well, well, what is it?  Wherefore make me wait?"
807,MAID,

809,MAID,
810,MAID,"How is it those lines run—oh, now I know;"
811,MAID,You make a stately entrance—measured—slow—
812,MAID,"To stirring music, then you kneel and say"
813,MAID,Something about—to honour and obey—
814,MAID,For better and for worse—till death do part.
815,MAID,
816,MAID,MAID (_angrily_)

821,MAID,
822,MAID,She needs great skill who takes the role of wife
823,MAID,In God’s stupendous drama human life.

825,MAID,MAID (_suddenly becoming serious_)
826,MAID,
827,MAID,"So I once thought!  Oh, once my very soul"
828,MAID,Was filled and thrilled with dreaming of that role.
829,MAID,Life seemed so wonderful; it held for me
830,MAID,"No purpose, no ambition, but to be"
831,MAID,Loving and loved.  My highest thought of fame
832,MAID,Was some day bearing my dear lover’s name.
833,MAID,"Alone, I ofttimes uttered it aloud,"
834,MAID,"Or wrote it down, half timid, and all proud"
835,MAID,To see myself lost utterly in him:
836,MAID,As some small star might joy in growing dim
837,MAID,"When sinking in the sun; or as the dew,"
838,MAID,Forgetting the brief little life it knew
839,MAID,"In space, might on the ocean’s bosom fall"
840,MAID,And ask for nothing—only to give all.
841,MAID,
842,MAID,CUPID (_aside_)
843,MAID,
844,MAID,"Now, _that’s_ the talk—it’s music to my ear"
845,MAID,After that stuff on ‘art’ and a ‘career.’
846,MAID,I hope she’ll keep it up.
847,MAID,
848,MAID,MAIDEN (_continuing her reverie_)
849,MAID,
850,MAID,Again my dream
851,MAID,Shaped into changing pictures.  I would seem
852,MAID,To see myself in beautiful array
853,MAID,Move down the aisle upon my wedding day;
854,MAID,And then I saw the modest living-room
855,MAID,"With lighted lamp, and fragrant plants in bloom,"
856,MAID,"And books and sewing scattered all about,"
857,MAID,And just we two alone.
858,MAID,
859,MAID,CUPID (_in glee aside_)
860,MAID,
861,MAID,There’s not a doubt
862,MAID,I’ll land her yet!

874,MAIDEN,
875,MAIDEN,"Another scene! a matron in her prime,"
876,MAIDEN,I saw myself glide peacefully with time
877,MAIDEN,"Into the quiet middle years, content"
878,MAIDEN,With simple joys the dear home circle lent.
879,MAIDEN,My sons and daughters made my diadem;
880,MAIDEN,I saw my happy youth renewed in them.
881,MAIDEN,"The pain of growing old lost all its sting,"
882,MAIDEN,"For Love stood near—in Winter, as in Spring."

887,MAIDEN,’Twas but a dream!  I woke all suddenly.
888,MAIDEN,The world had changed!  And now life means to me
889,MAIDEN,My art—the stage—excitement and the crowd—
890,MAIDEN,The glare of many foot-lights—and the loud
891,MAIDEN,"Applause of men, as I cry in rage,"
892,MAIDEN,‘Give me the dagger!’ or creep down the stage
893,MAIDEN,"In that sleep-walking scene.  Oh, art like mine"
894,MAIDEN,Will send the chills down every listener’s spine!
895,MAIDEN,"And when I choose, salt tears shall freely flow"

1188,AHASUERAS,"Across thy face, that for a moment veiled"
1189,AHASUERAS,"Thy soul from mine, and left me desolate."
1190,AHASUERAS,Thy thoughts were not of me?

1194,ESTHER,"Ay, _all_ of thee!"
1195,ESTHER,"I wondered, if in truth, thou wert content"
1196,ESTHER,With me—thy choice.  Was there no other one
1197,ESTHER,Of all who passed before thee at thy court
1198,ESTHER,Whose memory pursues thee with regret?
1199,ESTHER,
1200,AHASUERAS,AHASUERAS
1201,AHASUERAS,
1202,AHASUERAS,I do confess I much regret that day

1211,AHASUERAS,Yea!  I regret those hours I wasted on
1212,AHASUERAS,The poor procession that preceded thee.
1213,AHASUERAS,"Hadst thou come first, then all the added wealth"
1214,AHASUERAS,
1215,AHASUERAS,Of one long day of loving thee were mine—
1216,AHASUERAS,A boundless fortune squandered.  Though I live
1217,AHASUERAS,"To three score years and ten, as I do hope,"
1218,AHASUERAS,"In wedded love beside thee, that one day"
1219,AHASUERAS,Was filched from me and cannot be restored.

1221,ESTHER,ESTHER
1222,ESTHER,
1223,ESTHER,And then to think how frightened and abashed
1224,ESTHER,"I hung outside thy gates from early morn,"
1225,ESTHER,"Not daring to go in and meet thine eyes,"
1226,ESTHER,"Till pitying twilight clothed me in her veil,"
1227,ESTHER,And evening walked beside me to thy door.
1228,ESTHER,
1229,AHASUERAS,AHASUERAS
1230,AHASUERAS,
1231,AHASUERAS,"So it was thou, fair thief, who stole that day,"

1233,AHASUERAS,
1234,ESTHER,ESTHER
1235,ESTHER,
1236,ESTHER,"Full eight, I think.  They seemed a hundred then,"

1238,ESTHER,
1239,AHASUERAS,AHASUERAS
1240,AHASUERAS,
1241,AHASUERAS,"Then eight more kisses do I claim from thee,"
1242,AHASUERAS,This very hour—first tithes of many due.
1243,AHASUERAS,"I shall exact these payments as I will,"
1244,AHASUERAS,"And if they be not ready on demand,"
1245,AHASUERAS,"I’ll lock thee in the prison of my arms,"
1246,AHASUERAS,Like this—and take them so—and so—and so!
1247,AHASUERAS,
1248,ESTHER,ESTHER
1249,ESTHER,
1250,ESTHER,But kings must think of other things than love
1251,ESTHER,And live for other aims than happiness.
1252,ESTHER,I would not drag thee from thy altitude
1253,ESTHER,Of mighty ruler and great conqueror
1254,ESTHER,To chain thee by my side.
1255,ESTHER,
1256,AHASUERAS,AHASUERAS
1257,AHASUERAS,
1258,AHASUERAS,Such slavery
1259,AHASUERAS,Would please me better than to conquer earth
1260,AHASUERAS,"Without thee, Esther.  I have stood on heights"
1261,AHASUERAS,And heard the cheers of multitudes below;
1262,AHASUERAS,Have known the loneliness of being great.
1263,AHASUERAS,"Now, let me live and love thee, like a man,"
1264,AHASUERAS,Forgetting I am king—
1265,AHASUERAS,I am content.
1266,AHASUERAS,
1267,ESTHER,ESTHER
1268,ESTHER,
1269,ESTHER,Content is not the pathway to great deeds.
1270,ESTHER,"As man, I hold thee higher than all kings;"
1271,ESTHER,"As king, thou must stand higher than all men"
1272,ESTHER,In other eyes.  Let no one say of me:
1273,ESTHER,‘She spoiled his greatness by her littleness;
1274,ESTHER,"She made a languorous lover of a king,"
1275,ESTHER,And silenced war-cries on commanding lips—
1276,ESTHER,With honeyed kisses; made her woman’s arms
1277,ESTHER,"Preferred to armour, and her couch to tents,"
1278,ESTHER,"Until the kingdom, with no guiding hand,"
1279,ESTHER,Plunged down to ruin.’
1280,ESTHER,
1281,AHASUERAS,AHASUERAS
1282,AHASUERAS,
1283,AHASUERAS,Thou wouldst have me go—
1284,AHASUERAS,So soon thy heart hath wearied?
1285,AHASUERAS,
1286,ESTHER,ESTHER
1287,ESTHER,
1288,ESTHER,My heart is bursting with its love for thee!
1289,ESTHER,Canst thou not feel its fervour?  But great men
1290,ESTHER,Need wiser guidance than a woman’s heart.
1291,ESTHER,"My pride in thee is equal to my love,"
1292,ESTHER,And I would have thee greater than thou art—
1293,ESTHER,"Ay, greater than all other men on earth—"
1294,ESTHER,Though forced long years to feed my hungry heart
1295,ESTHER,"On food of memories and wine of tears,"
1296,ESTHER,Wert thou but winning glory and renown.
1297,ESTHER,
1298,AHASUERAS,AHASUERAS

1300,AHASUERAS,"Thou art most noble, Esther; thou art fit"
1301,AHASUERAS,To be the consort of a king of kings.
1302,AHASUERAS,But I have chewed upon ambition’s husks
1303,AHASUERAS,And starved for love through all my manhood’s years;
1304,AHASUERAS,And now the mighty gods have seen it fit
1305,AHASUERAS,"To spread love’s banquet and to name thee host,"
1306,AHASUERAS,"May I not feast my fill?  O Esther, take"
1307,AHASUERAS,The tempting nectar of those lips away
1308,AHASUERAS,"And give me wine to rouse the brute in me,"
1309,AHASUERAS,To make me thirst for blood instead of love!
1310,AHASUERAS,Wine!  Wine!  I say!

1317,ESTHER,Pressed from the ripened fruit of my fond heart.
1318,ESTHER,Mine own the words and mine the melody
1319,ESTHER,And may it linger longer in thine ear
1320,ESTHER,Than on thy lip would stay the taste of wine.

1378,THE COST,
1379,THE COST,All night she dreamed and wondered.  With the light
1380,THE COST,Her lover came—and then she understood
1381,THE COST,The purpose of her being.  Life was good
1382,THE COST,And all the world seemed right—
1383,THE COST,"And nothing was, but right."
1384,THE COST,

1402,THE COST,
1403,THE COST,Yet in the nights (oh! nights so dark and long)
1404,THE COST,She clasped her little children to her breast

1441,THE VOICE,And there was consternation in the camps;
1442,THE VOICE,And men who strutted under braid and lace
1443,THE VOICE,"Beat on their medalled breasts, and wailed, ‘Undone!’"
1444,THE VOICE,"The word was echoed from a thousand hills,"
1445,THE VOICE,"And shop and mill, and factory and forge,"
1446,THE VOICE,"Where throve the awful industries of death,"
1447,THE VOICE,"Hushed into silence.  Scrawled upon the doors,"

1452,THE VOICE,Again the Voice commanded: ‘Now go forth

1454,THE VOICE,This work has waited since the earth was shaped;

1456,THE VOICE,The needs of life outnumber needs of death.
1457,THE VOICE,"Leave death with God.  Go forth, I say, and build.’"
1458,THE VOICE,
1459,THE VOICE,"And then a sudden, comprehensive joy"
1460,THE VOICE,Shone in the eyes of men; and one who thought
1461,THE VOICE,Only of conquests and of victories
1462,THE VOICE,"Woke from his gloomy reverie and cried,"
1463,THE VOICE,"‘Ay, come and build!  I challenge all to try."

1472,THE VOICE,Their banquet tables spread with feasts of truth
1473,THE VOICE,"For all who hungered.  Music kissed the air,"
1474,THE VOICE,Once rent with boom of cannons.  Statues gleamed
1475,THE VOICE,"From wooded ways, where ambushed armies hid"
1476,THE VOICE,In times of old.  The sea and air were gay
1477,THE VOICE,With shining sails that soared from land to land.
1478,THE VOICE,A universal language of the world
1479,THE VOICE,"Made nations kin, and poverty was known"
1480,THE VOICE,
1481,THE VOICE,"But as a word marked ‘obsolete,’ like war."
1482,THE VOICE,The arts were kindled with celestial fire;
1483,THE VOICE,New poets sang so Homer’s fame grew dim;
1484,THE VOICE,And brush and chisel gave the wondering race
1485,THE VOICE,Sublimer treasures than old Greece displayed.
1486,THE VOICE,"Men differed still; fierce argument arose,"
1487,THE VOICE,For men are human in this human sphere;

1641,THE HEIGHTS,‘Outside thy gates; till thou hast given heed

1645,THE HEIGHTS,The beggar left me singing.  ‘Now at last—
1646,THE HEIGHTS,At last the path is clear.’
1647,THE HEIGHTS,"‘Nay, there is one draws near"
1648,THE HEIGHTS,"Who seeks, like thee, the difficult highway."
1649,THE HEIGHTS,He lacks thy courage; cheer him through the day
1650,THE HEIGHTS,"Then will we cry, “At last!”’"
1651,THE HEIGHTS,
1652,THE HEIGHTS,I helped my weaker brother.  ‘Now the heights;

1654,THE HEIGHTS,"The Presence at my side,"
1655,THE HEIGHTS,"With radiant face, said, ‘Look, where are we now?’"

1774,TIME’S GAZE,Was both an accusation and reproach.
1775,TIME’S GAZE,No speech was needed.  In a sorrowing look
1776,TIME’S GAZE,"More meaning lies than in complaining words,"

3794,OBSTACLES,There are no lions in the street;
3795,OBSTACLES,No lions in the way.

3837,CLIMBING,The winding road slants downward many a time;
3838,CLIMBING,Yet each descent is higher than the last.
3839,CLIMBING,Has thy path fallen?  That will soon be past.
3840,CLIMBING,Beyond the curve the way leads up and on.

3893,REALISATION,"Hers was a lonely, shadowed lot;"
3894,REALISATION,"Or so the unperceiving thought,"
3895,REALISATION,"Who looked no deeper than her face,"
3896,REALISATION,Devoid of chiselled lines of grace—
3897,REALISATION,"No farther than her humble grate,"
3898,REALISATION,And wondered how she bore her fate.
3899,REALISATION,
3900,REALISATION,Yet she was neither lone nor sad;
3901,REALISATION,"So much of love her spirit had,"
3902,REALISATION,She found an ever-flowing spring
3903,REALISATION,Of happiness in everything.
3904,REALISATION,
3905,REALISATION,So near to her was Nature’s heart
3906,REALISATION,It seemed a very living part
3907,REALISATION,"Of her own self; and bud and blade,"
3908,REALISATION,"And heat and cold, and sun and shade,"
3909,REALISATION,"And dawn and sunset, Spring and Fall,"
3910,REALISATION,"Held raptures for her, one and all."
3911,REALISATION,
3912,REALISATION,The year’s four changing seasons brought
3913,REALISATION,To her own door what thousands sought
3914,REALISATION,In wandering ways and did not find—
3915,REALISATION,Diversion and content of mind.
3916,REALISATION,
3917,REALISATION,She loved the tasks that filled each day—
3918,REALISATION,Such menial duties; but her way
3919,REALISATION,Of looking at them lent a grace
3920,REALISATION,To things the world deemed commonplace.
3921,REALISATION,
3922,REALISATION,"Obscure and without place or name,"
3923,REALISATION,She gloried in another’s fame.
3924,REALISATION,"Poor, plain and humble in her dress,"
3925,REALISATION,She thrilled when beauty and success
3926,REALISATION,"And wealth passed by, on pleasure bent;"
3927,REALISATION,They made earth seem so opulent.
3928,REALISATION,"Yet none of quicker sympathy,"
3929,REALISATION,"When need or sorrow came, than she."
3930,REALISATION,"And so she lived, and so she died."
3931,REALISATION,
3932,REALISATION,She woke as from a dream.  How wide
3933,REALISATION,And wonderful the avenue
3934,REALISATION,That stretched to her astonished view!
3935,REALISATION,And up the green ascending lawn
3936,REALISATION,A palace caught the rays of dawn.
3937,REALISATION,
3938,REALISATION,Then suddenly the silence stirred
3939,REALISATION,With one clear keynote of a bird;
3940,REALISATION,"A thousand answered, till ere long"
3941,REALISATION,The air was quivering bits of song.
3942,REALISATION,"She rose and wandered forth in awe,"
3943,REALISATION,"Amazed and moved by all she saw,"
3944,REALISATION,"For, like so many souls who go"
3945,REALISATION,"Away from earth, she did not know"
3946,REALISATION,The cord was severed.
3947,REALISATION,
3948,REALISATION,"Down the street,"
3949,REALISATION,"With eager arms stretched forth to greet,"
3950,REALISATION,Came one she loved and mourned in youth;
3951,REALISATION,Her mother followed; then the truth
3952,REALISATION,"Broke on her, golden wave on wave,"
3953,REALISATION,"Of knowledge infinite.  The grave,"
3954,REALISATION,The body and the earthly sphere
3955,REALISATION,Were gone!  Immortal life was here!
3956,REALISATION,They led her through the Palace halls;
3957,REALISATION,From gleaming mirrors on the walls
3958,REALISATION,"She saw herself, with radiant mien,"
3959,REALISATION,"And robed in splendour like a queen,"
3960,REALISATION,While glory round about her shone.
3961,REALISATION,"‘All this,’ Love murmured, ‘is your own.’"
3962,REALISATION,
3963,REALISATION,"And when she gazed with wondering eye,"
3964,REALISATION,"And questioned whence and where and why,"
3965,REALISATION,Love answered thus: ‘All Heaven is made
3966,REALISATION,"By thoughts on earth; your walls were laid,"
3967,REALISATION,"Year after year, of purest gold;"
3968,REALISATION,The beauty of your mind behold
3969,REALISATION,"In this fair palace; ay, and more"
3970,REALISATION,"Waits farther on, so vast your store."
3971,REALISATION,I was not worthy when I died
3972,REALISATION,To take my place here at your side;
3973,REALISATION,I toiled through long and weary years
3974,REALISATION,From lower planes to these high spheres;
3975,REALISATION,And through the love you sent from earth
3976,REALISATION,I have attained a second birth.
3977,REALISATION,Oft when my erring soul would tire
3978,REALISATION,I felt the strength of your desire;
3979,REALISATION,"I heard you breathe my name in prayer,"
3980,REALISATION,And courage conquered weak despair.
3981,REALISATION,"Ah! earth needs heaven, but heaven indeed"
3982,REALISATION,Of earth has just as great a need.’
3983,REALISATION,
3984,REALISATION,Across the terrace with a bound
3985,REALISATION,There sped a lambkin and a hound
3986,REALISATION,(Dumb comrades of the old earth land)
3987,REALISATION,And fondled her caressing hand.
3988,REALISATION,
3989,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’
3990,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,Was answered to her questioning eyes;
3991,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,‘You taught them love; love has no end!
3992,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,Nor does love’s life on form depend.
3993,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,"If there be mortal without love,"
3994,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,He wakes to no new life above.
3995,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,"If love in humbler things exist,"
3996,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,It must through other realms persist
3997,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,Until all love rays merge in HIM.
3998,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,Hark!  Hear the heavenly Cherubim!’
3999,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,
4000,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,"Then hushed and awed, with joy so vast"
4001,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,"It knew no future and no past,"
4002,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,She stood amidst the radiant throng
4003,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,That came to swell love’s welcoming song—
4004,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,This humble soul from earth’s far coast
4005,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,The centre of the heavenly host.
4006,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,
4007,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,On earth they see her grave and say:
4008,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,‘She lies there till the judgment day;’
4009,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,"Nor dream, so limited their thought,"
4010,‘YOU LOVED THEM INTO PARADISE’,What miracles by love are wrought.
