37,FOREWORD,"Adelaide Crapsey, daughter of Algernon Sidney and Adelaide Trowbridge"
38,FOREWORD,"Crapsey, was born on the ninth of September, 1878.  She died in her"
39,FOREWORD,"thirty-sixth year on October the eighth, 1914.  Her young girlhood"
40,FOREWORD,"was spent in Rochester, New York, where her eminent father was rector"
41,FOREWORD,of St. Andrew's Parish.  At fourteen she entered the preparatory
42,FOREWORD,"school of Kemper Hall, Kenosha, Wisconsin, from which school she"
43,FOREWORD,"graduated at the head of her class, in 1897.  She entered Vassar"
44,FOREWORD,"College the same year, graduating with the class of 1901."
45,FOREWORD,
46,FOREWORD,Two years after her graduation she began her work as a teacher of
47,FOREWORD,"History and Literature, in Kemper Hall.  In 1905 she went abroad and"
48,FOREWORD,became a student in the School of Archaeology in Rome.  The following
49,FOREWORD,year she assumed the position of instructor in Literature and History
50,FOREWORD,"in Miss Lowe's Preparatory School in Stamford, Conn., but in 1908 on"
51,FOREWORD,account of failing health she was compelled to abandon teaching for
52,FOREWORD,"a time.  The two succeeding years she spent in Italy and England,"
53,FOREWORD,working on her _Analysis of English Metrics_--an exhaustive scientific
54,FOREWORD,thesis relating to accent--which years before she had planned to
55,FOREWORD,accomplish as her serious life work.
56,FOREWORD,
57,FOREWORD,In 1911 she returned to America and became instructor in Poetics at
58,FOREWORD,Smith College.  The double burden of teaching and writing proved too
59,FOREWORD,"much for her frail constitution, and in 1913, gravely ill, she was"
60,FOREWORD,obliged to abandon definitely and finally both activities.  The rest
61,FOREWORD,is a silence broken only by the remarkable verses of her last poetic
62,FOREWORD,phase.
63,FOREWORD,
64,FOREWORD,These are the bare biographical facts in the life of Adelaide
65,FOREWORD,"Crapsey, but it would be an injustice to the reader not to attempt to"
66,FOREWORD,"render some sense of her personality, all compounded of beauty,"
67,FOREWORD,"mystery and charm.  I remember her as fair and fragile, in action"
68,FOREWORD,"swift, in repose still; so quick and silent in her movements that she"
69,FOREWORD,"seemed never to enter a room but to appear there, and on the stroke of"
70,FOREWORD,some invisible clock to vanish as she had come.
71,FOREWORD,
72,FOREWORD,"Although in Meredith's phrase ""a man and a woman both for brains,"""
73,FOREWORD,she was an intensely feminine presence.  Perfection was the passion of
74,FOREWORD,"her life, and as one discerns it in her verse, one marked it also in"
75,FOREWORD,her raiment.  In the line
76,FOREWORD,
77,FOREWORD,"""And know my tear-drenched veil along the grass"""
78,FOREWORD,
79,FOREWORD,I see again her drooping figure with some trail of gossamer
80,FOREWORD,bewitchment clinging about or drifting after her.  Although her body
81,FOREWORD,spoke of a fastidious and sedulous care in keeping with her
82,FOREWORD,"essentially aristocratic nature, she was merciless in the demands she"
83,FOREWORD,"made upon it, and this was the direct cause of her loss of health."
84,FOREWORD,The keen and shining blade of her spirit too greatly scorned its
85,FOREWORD,"scabbard the body, and for this she paid the uttermost penalty."
86,FOREWORD,
87,FOREWORD,Her death was tragic.  Full of the desire of life she yet was forced
88,FOREWORD,"to go, leaving her work all unfinished.  Her last year was spent in"
89,FOREWORD,exile at Saranac Lake.  From her window she looked down on the
90,FOREWORD,"graveyard--""Trudeau's Garden,"" she called it, with grim-gay irony."
91,FOREWORD,"Here, forbidden the work her metrical study entailed, these poems"
92,FOREWORD,grew--flowers of a battlefield of the spirit.  But of her passionate
93,FOREWORD,revolt against the mandate of her destiny she spared her family and
94,FOREWORD,friends even a sign.  When they came to cheer and comfort her it was
95,FOREWORD,she who brought them cheer and comfort.  With magnificent and
96,FOREWORD,appalling courage she gave forth to them the humor and gaiety of her
97,FOREWORD,"unclouded years, saving them even beyond the end from knowledge of"
98,FOREWORD,"this beautiful and terrible testament of a spirit all unreconciled,"
99,FOREWORD,"flashing ""unquenched defiance to the stars."""
100,FOREWORD,
101,FOREWORD,"This collection of her verse is of her own choosing, arranged and"
102,FOREWORD,prepared by her own hand.  She wrote gay verse in the earlier days
103,FOREWORD,"before the shadow fell upon her, but her rigorous regard for unity"
104,FOREWORD,banished it from this record of the fearful questioning of her
105,FOREWORD,spirit.
106,FOREWORD,
107,FOREWORD,"This ""immortal residue"" is full of poignancy and power.  The heart"
108,FOREWORD,is stricken with her own terror at the approach of
109,FOREWORD,
110,FOREWORD,"""The despot of our days the lord of dust."""
111,FOREWORD,
112,FOREWORD,The book which is her funeral urn will be found to hold more than
113,FOREWORD,"the ashes of a personal passion, it contains"
114,FOREWORD,
115,FOREWORD,"""Infinite passion, and the pain of finite hearts that yearn."""

123,PREFACE,PREFACE
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,"Adelaide Crapsey was, over a term of many years, an eager student of"
126,PREFACE,the technical aspects of English poetry.  She died on October eighth
127,PREFACE,"1914, after having completed two-thirds of her _Analysis of English"
128,PREFACE,"Metrics_--an exhaustive scientific thesis relating to accent--which,"
129,PREFACE,"years before, she had planned to accomplish as her serious life work."
130,PREFACE,Though her mind was intensely preoccupied with the technical and
131,PREFACE,"analytical aspects of prosody, still the creative, artistic side of"
132,PREFACE,"her nature was so spontaneously alive, that she accomplished a very"
133,PREFACE,considerable volume of original poetry--almost as a by-product of her
134,PREFACE,study in metrics.
135,PREFACE,
136,PREFACE,"In the gay and somewhat insouciant period of her early days, she could"
137,PREFACE,write finished verse with the ease and readiness that the majority of
138,PREFACE,people reserve only for the most commonplace of prose.  I have
139,PREFACE,actually known her to produce the book of an acceptable operetta over
140,PREFACE,the week-end!  That early work is gone.  It lives only in the memory
141,PREFACE,of those who happened to be near her at the time.  She tossed it off
142,PREFACE,"as the fleeting expression of a moment, and took no slightest care to"
143,PREFACE,preserve it.  But several of those early poems stick persistently in
144,PREFACE,"my mind over the years, and though I have no copy and cannot quote"
145,PREFACE,"them accurately, I still believe them worthy of a permanent form."
146,PREFACE,"That delightful quality of camaraderie, her quick, bubbling humor she"
147,PREFACE,"retained to the end in conversation; the sadder, sombre questioning of"
148,PREFACE,her inner life attained expression only in the poetry she has left.
149,PREFACE,
150,PREFACE,"These poems, of a gossamer delicacy and finish, are the stronger for"
151,PREFACE,"the technical knowledge behind them.  Likewise, her technical work"
152,PREFACE,possessed the more vigor because it was not the result of mere
153,PREFACE,"theoretical analysis, but also of the first-hand knowledge gained"
154,PREFACE,through her own creative achievement.  In each field she spoke with
155,PREFACE,the authority that experience in the other gave.  Her studies in
156,PREFACE,prosody were too technical for comprehension by the lay reader.  It
157,PREFACE,"is through her creative work that she will be remembered, though she"
158,PREFACE,herself considered this the slightest part of her accomplishment.
159,PREFACE,
160,PREFACE,As her study in metrics was astoundingly objective and coldly
161,PREFACE,"unreflective of any emotional mood, so her own poems were at the other"
162,PREFACE,"extreme, astoundingly subjective and descriptive of a mental state"
163,PREFACE,that found expression in no other form.  They are heart-breakingly
164,PREFACE,sombre; but they are true.
165,PREFACE,
166,PREFACE,"Adelaide Crapsey, by nature as vivid and joyous and alive a spirit as"
167,PREFACE,"ever loved the beauty of life, like Keats and Stevenson, worked"
168,PREFACE,doggedly for many years against the numbing weight of a creeping
169,PREFACE,"pitiless disease.  In her last year, spent in exile at Saranac Lake,"
170,PREFACE,"forbidden the strength-sapping work that her metrical study entailed,"
171,PREFACE,she was forced to lie and look into space--and these poems grew.  Her
172,PREFACE,"window looked down upon the Saranac graveyard, ""Trudeau's garden,"""
173,PREFACE,"she gaily called it; but its meaning struck home.  ""To the Dead in the"
174,PREFACE,"Graveyard Underneath my Window,"" was among the papers she left behind."
175,PREFACE,
176,PREFACE,"The verse form which she calls ""Cinquain"" she originated herself.  It"
177,PREFACE,is an example of extremest compression.  She reduces an idea to its
178,PREFACE,very lowest terms--and presents it in a single sharp impression.
179,PREFACE,
180,PREFACE,In spite of the fact that many of these poems were left only in their
181,PREFACE,"first rough draft, they are marvelously perfect.  A fastidious"
182,PREFACE,distinction marks all of her work--all of her life--it was the most
183,PREFACE,characteristic feature of a very rare nature.
