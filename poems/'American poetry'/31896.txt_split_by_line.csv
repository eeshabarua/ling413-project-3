57,R. E. LEE GIBSON,"four which appeared in two earlier volumes, published some ten years"
58,R. E. LEE GIBSON,"ago. The reprinted poems have been carefully re-written, and so changed"
59,R. E. LEE GIBSON,"throughout as to hardly bear any resemblance, except that of subject, to"

160,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
161,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
162,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
163,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
164,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The Brothers
165,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
166,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
167,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Not far from here, it lies beyond"
168,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That low-hilled belt of woods. We'll take
169,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,This unused lane where brambles make
170,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A wall of twilight, and the blond"
171,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Brier-roses pelt the path and flake
172,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The margin waters of a pond.
173,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
174,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,This is its fence--or that which was
175,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Its fence once--now, rock rolled from rock,"
176,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"One tangle of the vine and dock,"
177,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Where bloom the wild petunias;
178,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And this its gate, the iron-weeds block,"
179,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Hot with the insects' dusty buzz.
180,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
181,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Two wooden posts, wherefrom has peeled"
182,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The weather-crumbled paint, still rise;"
183,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Gaunt things--that groan when someone tries
184,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The gate whose hinges, rust-congealed,"
185,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Snarl open:--on each post still lies
186,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Its carven lion with a shield.
187,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
188,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,We enter; and between great rows
189,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of locusts winds a grass-grown road;
190,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And at its glimmering end,--o'erflowed"
191,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"With quiet light,--the white front shows"
192,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of an old mansion, grand and broad,"
193,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,With grave Colonial porticoes.
194,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
195,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Grown thick around it, dark and deep,"
196,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The locust trees make one vast hush;
197,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Their brawny branches crowd and crush
198,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Its very casements, and o'ersweep"
199,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Its rotting roofs; their tranquil rush
200,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Haunts all its spacious rooms with sleep.
201,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
202,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Still is it called The Locusts; though
203,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,None lives here now. A tale's to tell
204,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of some dark thing that here befell;
205,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A crime that happened years ago,"
206,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"When by its walls, with shot and shell,"
207,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The war swept on and left it so.
208,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
209,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"For one black night, within it, shame"
210,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Made revel, while, all here about,"
211,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"With prayer or curse or battle-shout,"
212,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Men died and homesteads leapt in flame:
213,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Then passed the conquering Northern rout,"
214,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And left it silent and the same.
215,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
216,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Why should I speak of what has been?
217,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Or what dark part I played in all?
218,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Why ruin sits in porch and hall
219,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Where pride and gladness once were seen;
220,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And why beneath this lichened wall
221,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The grave of Margaret is green.
222,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
223,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Heart-broken Margaret! whose fate
224,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Was sadder yet than his who won
225,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Her hand--my brother Hamilton--
226,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Or mine, who learned to know too late;"
227,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Who learned to know, when all was done,"
228,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And nothing could exonerate.
229,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
230,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"To expiate is still my lot,--"
231,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And, like the Ancient Mariner,"
232,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To show to others how things are
233,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And what I am, still helps me blot"
234,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A little from that crime's red scar,"
235,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That on my soul is branded hot.
236,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
237,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,He was my only brother. She
238,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A sister of my brother's friend.
239,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"They met, and married in the end."
240,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And I remember well when he
241,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Brought her rejoicing home, the trend"
242,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of war moved towards us sullenly.
243,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
244,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And scarce a year of wedlock when
245,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Its red arms took him from his bride.
246,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,With lips by hers thrice sanctified
247,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,He left to ride with Morgan's men.
248,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And I--I never could decide--
249,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Remained at home. It happened then.
250,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
251,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"For days went by. And, oft delayed,"
252,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A letter came of loving word
253,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Scrawled by some camp-fire, sabre-stirred,"
254,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Or by a pine-knot's fitful aid,"
255,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"When in the saddle, armed and spurred"
256,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And booted for some hurried raid.
257,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
258,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Then weeks went by. I do not know
259,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"How long it was before there came,"
260,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Blown from the North, the clarion fame"
261,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of Morgan, who, with blow on blow,"
262,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Had drawn a line of blood and flame
263,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,From Tennessee to Ohio.
264,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
265,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Then letters ceased; and days went on.
266,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"No word from him. The war rolled back,"
267,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And in its turgid crimson track
268,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A rumor grew, like some wild dawn,"
269,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"All ominous and red and black,"
270,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"With news of our lost Hamilton,"
271,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
272,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That hinted death or capture. Yet
273,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"No thing was sure; till one day,--fed"
274,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"By us,--some men rode up who said"
275,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,They'd been with Morgan and had met
276,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Disaster, and that he was dead,"
277,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,My brother.--I and Margaret
278,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
279,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Believed them. Grief was ours too:
280,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,But mine was more for her than him;
281,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Grief, that her eyes with tears were dim;"
282,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Grief, that became the avenue"
283,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"For love, who crowned the sombre brim"
284,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of death's dark cup with rose-red hue.
285,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
286,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In sympathy,--unconsciously"
287,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Though it be given--I hold, doth dwell"
288,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The germ of love that time shall swell
289,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To blossom. Sooner then in me--
290,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,When close relations so befell--
291,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That love should spring from sympathy.
292,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
293,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Our similar tastes and mutual bents
294,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Combined to make us intimates
295,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,From our first meeting. Different states
296,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of interest then our temperaments
297,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Begot. Then friendship, that abates"
298,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"No love, whose self it represents."
299,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
300,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,These led to talks and dreams: how oft
301,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,We sat at some wide window while
302,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The sun sank o'er the hills' far file,"
303,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Serene; and of the cloud aloft
304,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Made one vast rose; and mile on mile
305,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of firmament grew sad and soft.
306,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
307,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And all in harmony with these
308,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Dim clemencies of dusk, afar"
309,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Our talks and dreams went; while the star
310,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of evening brightened o'er the trees:
311,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,We spoke of home; the end of war:
312,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,We dreamed of life and love and peace.
313,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
314,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,How on our walks in listening lanes
315,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Or confidences of the wood,"
316,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,We paused to hear the dove that cooed;
317,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Or gathered wild-flowers, taking pains"
318,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To find the fairest; or her hood
319,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Filled with wild fruit that left deep stains.
320,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
321,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"No echo of the drum or fife,"
322,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,No hint of conflict entered in
323,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Our thoughts then. Will you call it sin--
324,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Indifference to a nation's strife?
325,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"What side might lose, what side might win,"
326,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Both immaterial to our life.
327,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
328,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Into the past we did not look;
329,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Beyond what was we did not dream;
330,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,While onward rushed the thunderous stream
331,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of war, that, in its torrent, took"
332,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,One of our own. No crimson gleam
333,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of its wild course around us shook.
334,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
335,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,At last we knew. And when we learned
336,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"How he had fallen, Margaret"
337,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Wept; and, albeit my eyes were wet,"
338,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Within my soul I half discerned
339,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A joy that mingled with regret,"
340,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A grief that to relief was turned.
341,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
342,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,As time went on and confidence
343,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Drew us more strongly each to each,"
344,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Why did no intimation reach
345,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Its warning hand into the dense
346,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Soul-silence, and confuse the speech"
347,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of love's unbroken eloquence!
348,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
349,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"But, no! no hint to turn the poise,"
350,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Or check the impulse of our youth;
351,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To chill it with the living truth
352,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,As with the awe of God's own voice;
353,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"No hint, to make our hope uncouth;"
354,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"No word, to warn us from our choice."
355,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
356,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To me a wall seemed overthrown
357,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That social law had raised between;
358,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And o'er its ruin, broad and green"
359,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A path went, I possessed alone;"
360,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The sky above seemed all serene;
361,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The land around seemed all my own.
362,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
363,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,What shall I say of Margaret
364,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To justify her part in this?
365,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That her young heart was never his?
366,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,But had been mine since first we met?
367,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,So would you say!--Enough it is
368,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That when he left she loved him yet.
369,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
370,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"So passed the Spring, and Summer sped;"
371,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And early Autumn brought the day
372,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"When she her hand in mine should lay,"
373,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And I should take her hand and wed.
374,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And still no hint that might gainsay,"
375,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,No warning word of quick or dead.
376,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
377,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The day arrived; and, with it born,"
378,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A battle, sullying the East"
379,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"With boom of cannon, that increased,"
380,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And throb of musket and of horn:
381,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Until at last, towards dusk, it ceased;"
382,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And men with faces wild and worn,"
383,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
384,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,In fierce retreat swept past; now groups;
385,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Now one by one; now sternly white,"
386,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Or blood-stained; now with looks whose fright
387,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Said all was lost. Then sullen troops
388,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"That, beaten, still kept up the fight."
389,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Then came the victors; shadowy loops
390,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
391,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of men and horse, that left a crowd"
392,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of officers in hall and porch....
393,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,While through the land around the torch
394,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Circled, and many a fiery cloud"
395,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Marked out the army's iron march
396,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In furrows red, that pillage plowed,"
397,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
398,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Here we were wedded.--Ask the years
399,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"How such could be, while over us"
400,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A sword of wrath swung ominous,"
401,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And on our cheeks its breath was fierce!
402,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"All I remember is--'twas thus,"
403,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And Margaret's eyes were wet with tears.
404,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
405,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,No other cause my memory sees
406,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Save this, _that night was set_; and when"
407,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I found my home filled with armed men
408,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,With whom were all my sympathies
409,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of Union--why postpone it then?
410,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,So argued conscience into peace.
411,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
412,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And then it was, when night had passed"
413,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,There came to me an orderly
414,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,With word of a confederate spy
415,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Late taken, who, with head downcast,"
416,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Had asked one favor, this: ""That I"
417,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Would see him ere he breathed his last."""
418,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
419,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I stand alone here. Heavily
420,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"My thoughts go back. Had I not gone,"
421,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The dead had still been dead!--for none
422,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Had yet believed his story--he,"
423,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"My dead-deemed brother, Hamilton,"
424,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Who in the spy confronted me.
425,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
426,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"O you who never have been tried,"
427,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,How can you judge me!--in my place
428,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I saw him standing--who can trace
429,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"My heart thoughts then!--I turned aside,"
430,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A thing of some unnatural race,"
431,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And did not speak; and so he died.
432,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
433,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In hospital or prison, when"
434,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,It was he lay; what had forbid
435,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,His home return so long: amid
436,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"What hardships he had suffered, then"
437,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"I dared not ask; and when I did,"
438,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Long afterwards, inquire of men,"
439,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
440,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,No thing I learned. But this I feel--
441,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,He who had so returned to life
442,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Was not a spy. Through stress and strife,--"
443,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,This makes my conscience hard to heal!--
444,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,He had escaped; he sought his wife;
445,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,He sought his home that should conceal.
446,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
447,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And Margaret! Oh, pity her!"
448,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A criminal I sought her side,"
449,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Still thinking love was justified
450,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,In all for her--whatever were
451,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The price, a brother thrice denied,"
452,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Or thrice a brother's murderer.
453,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
454,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Since then long years have passed away.
455,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And through those years, perhaps, you'll ask"
456,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,How to the world I wore my mask
457,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of honesty?--I can but say
458,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Beyond my powers it was a task;
459,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Before my time it turned me gray.
460,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
461,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And when at last the ceaseless hiss
462,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of conscience drove, and I betrayed"
463,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"All to her, she knelt down and prayed,"
464,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Then rose; and 'twixt us an abyss
465,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Was opened; and she seemed to fade
466,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Out of my life: I came to miss
467,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
468,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The sweet attentions of a bride:
469,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,For each appealing heart's caress
470,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In me, her heart assumed a dress"
471,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of dull indifference; till denied
472,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,To me was all responsiveness;
473,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And then I knew her love had died.
474,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
475,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, had she loaded me, perchance,"
476,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"With wild reproach or even hate,"
477,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Such would have helped a hope to wait
478,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Forgiveness and returned romance;
479,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"But 'twixt our souls, instead, a gate"
480,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,She closed of silent tolerance.
481,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
482,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Yet, 't was for love of her I lent"
483,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,My soul to crime ... I question me
484,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Often, if less entirely"
485,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"I'd loved her, then, in that event,"
486,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,She had been justified to see
487,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The deed alone stand prominent.
488,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
489,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The deed alone! But love records
490,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In his own heart, I will aver,"
491,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,No depth I did not feel for her
492,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Beyond the plummet-reach of words:
493,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And though there may be worthier,"
494,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,No truer love this world affords
495,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
496,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Than mine was, though it could not rise"
497,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Above itself. And so 't was best,"
498,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Perhaps, that she saw manifest"
499,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Its crime, that I, as saw her eyes,"
500,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Might see; and so, in soul confessed,"
501,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Some life atonement might devise.
502,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
503,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Sadly my heart one comfort keeps,"
504,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"That, towards the end, she took my hands"
505,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And said, as one who understands,"
506,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"""Had I but seen! But love that weeps,"
507,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Sees only as its loss commands,"""
508,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And sighed. Beneath this stone she sleeps.
509,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
510,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Yes; I have suffered for that sin;
511,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Yet in no instance would I shun
512,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"What I should suffer. Many a one,"
513,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Who heard my tale, has tried to win"
514,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Me to believe that Hamilton
515,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"It was not; and, though proven kin,"
516,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
517,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,This had not saved him. Still the stain
518,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of the intention--had I erred
519,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And 't was not he--had writ the word
520,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Red on my soul that branded Cain;
521,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,For still my error had incurred
522,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The fact of guilt that would remain.
523,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
524,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, love at best is insecure,"
525,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And lives with doubt and vain regret;
526,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And hope and faith, with faces set"
527,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Upon the past, are never sure;"
528,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And through their fever, grief, and fret"
529,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The heart may fail that should endure.
530,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
531,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"For in ourselves, however blend"
532,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The passions that make heaven and hell,"
533,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Is evil not accountable
534,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,For most the good we comprehend?
535,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And through these two, or ill, or well,"
536,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Man must evolve his spiritual end.
537,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
538,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,It is with deeds that we must ask
539,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Forgiveness; for upon this earth,"
540,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Life walks alone from very birth
541,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"With death, hope tells us is a mask"
542,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"For life beyond of vaster worth,"
543,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Where sin no more sets love a task.
544,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
545,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
546,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
547,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
548,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Geraldine
549,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
550,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
551,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine,"
552,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"That night of love, when first we met,"
553,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"You have forgotten, Geraldine--"
554,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I never dreamed you would forget.
555,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
556,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, Geraldine, sweet Geraldine,"
557,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"More lovely than that Asian queen,"
558,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Scheherazade, the beautiful,"
559,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Who in her orient palace cool
560,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of India, for a thousand nights"
561,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And one, beside her monarch lay,"
562,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Telling--while sandal-scented lights
563,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And music stole the soul away--
564,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Love tales of old Arabia,"
565,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Full of enchantments and emprise--
566,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,But no enchantments like your eyes.
567,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
568,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, Geraldine, loved Geraldine,"
569,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"More lovely than those maids, I ween,"
570,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Pampinea and Lauretta, who,"
571,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In gardens old of dusk and dew,"
572,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Sat with their lovers, maid and man,"
573,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"In stately days Italian,"
574,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And in quaint stories, that we know"
575,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Through grace of good Boccaccio,"
576,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Told of fond loves, some false, some true,--"
577,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"But, Geraldine, none false as you."
578,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
579,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine,"
580,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"That night of love, when first we met,"
581,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"You have forgotten, Geraldine--"
582,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I never dreamed you would forget.
583,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
584,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"'T was summer, and the moon swam high,"
585,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A great pale pearl within the sky:
586,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And down that purple night of love
587,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The stars, concurrent spark on spark,"
588,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Seemed fiery moths that swarmed above:
589,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And through the roses, o'er the park,"
590,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Star-like the fire-flies filled the dark:
591,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A mocking-bird in some deep tree,"
592,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Drowsy with dreams and melody,"
593,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Like a magnolia bud, that, dim,"
594,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Opens and pours its soul in musk,"
595,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Gave to the moonlight and the dusk
596,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Its heart's pure song, its evening hymn."
597,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Oh, night of love! when in the dance"
598,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Your heart thrilled rapture into mine,"
599,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,As in a state of necromance
600,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A mortal hears a voice divine.
601,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Oh, night of love! when from your glance"
602,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I drank sweet death as men drink wine.
603,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
604,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,You wearied of the waltz at last.
605,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I led you out into the night.
606,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Warm in my hand I held yours fast.
607,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
608,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Your face was flushed; your eyes were bright.
609,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The moon hung like a shell of light
610,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Above the lake, above the trees:"
611,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And borne to us with fragrances
612,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of roses that were ripe to fall,"
613,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The soul of music from the hall
614,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Beat in the moonlight and the breeze,"
615,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,As youth's wild heart grown weary of
616,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Desire and its dream of love.
617,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
618,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"I held your arm and, for awhile,"
619,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,We walked along the balmy aisle
620,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of flowers that, like velvet, dips"
621,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Unto the lake which lilies tile
622,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Like stars; and hyacinths, like strips"
623,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of heaven: and beside a fall,"
624,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"That, down a ferned and mossy wall,"
625,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Fell in the lake,--deep, woodbine-wound,"
626,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A latticed summer-house we found;
627,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A green kiosk,--through which the sound"
628,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Of waters and of breezes swayed,"
629,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And honeysuckle bugles played
630,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Soft serenades of perfume sweet,--"
631,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Around which ran a rustic seat.
632,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And seated in that haunted nook,--"
633,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"I know not how it was,--a word,"
634,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"A touch, perhaps, a sigh, a look,"
635,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Was father to the kiss I took;
636,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
637,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Great things grow out of small I've heard.
638,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,And then it was I took between
639,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"My hands your face, loved Geraldine,"
640,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And gazed into your eyes, and told"
641,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The story ever new though old.
642,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"You did not look away, but met"
643,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,My eyes with eyes whose lids were wet
644,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,With tears of truth; and you did lean
645,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Your cheek to mine, sweet Geraldine,--"
646,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I never dreamed you would forget.
647,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
648,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The night-wind and the water sighed:
649,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And through the leaves, that stirred above,"
650,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The moonbeams swooned with music of
651,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The dance--soft things in league with love:
652,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I never dreamed that you had lied.
653,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
654,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"How all comes back now, Geraldine!"
655,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The melody; the glimmering scene;
656,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Your angel face; and ev'n, between"
657,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Your lawny breasts, the heart-shaped jewel,--"
658,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"To which your breath gave fluctuant fuel,--"
659,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,A rosy star of stormy fire;
660,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The snowy drift of your attire,"
661,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Lace-deep and fragrant: and your hair,"
662,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Disordered in the dance, held back"
663,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"By one gemmed pin,--a moonbeam there,"
664,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Half-drowned within its night-like black.
665,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"And I who sat beside you then,"
666,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Seemed blessed above all mortal men.
667,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
668,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I loved you for the way you sighed;
669,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The way you said, ""I love but you;"""
670,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The smile with which your lips replied;
671,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Your lips, that from my bosom drew"
672,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"The soul; your looks, like undenied"
673,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Caresses, that seemed naught but true:"
674,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I loved you for the violet scent
675,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That clung about you as a flower;
676,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Your moods, where shine and shadow blent,"
677,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,An April-tide of sun and shower;
678,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"You were my creed, my testament,"
679,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Wherein I read of God's high power.
680,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
681,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Was it because the loving see
682,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Only what they desire shall be
683,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"There in the well-belovéd's soul,"
684,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Affection and affinity,"
685,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,That I beheld in you the whole
686,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,Of my love's image? and believed
687,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,You loved as I did? nor perceived
688,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"'T was but a mask, a mockery!"
689,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
690,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"Ah, Geraldine, lost Geraldine,"
691,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"That night of love, when first we met,"
692,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,"You have forgotten, Geraldine--"
693,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,I never dreamed you would forget.
694,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
695,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
696,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
697,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
698,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,The Moated Manse
699,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
700,IDYLLIC MONOLOGUES,
701,I.,I.
702,I.,
703,I.,And now once more we stood within the walls
704,I.,Of her old manor near the riverside;
705,I.,"Dead leaves lay rotting in its empty halls,"
706,I.,And here and there the ivy could not hide
707,I.,"The year-old scars, made by the Royalists' balls,"
708,I.,"Around the doorway, where so many died"
709,I.,"In that last effort to defend the stair,"
710,I.,"When Rupert, like a demon, entered there."
711,I.,
712,I.,
713,II.,II.
714,II.,
715,II.,The basest Cavalier who yet wore spurs
716,II.,"Or drew a sword, I count him; with his grave"
717,II.,Eyes 'neath his plumed hat like a wolf's whom curs
718,II.,"Rouse, to their harm, within a forest cave;"
719,II.,And hair like harvest; and a voice like verse
720,II.,"For smoothness. Ay, a handsome man and brave!--"
721,II.,Brave?--who would question it! although 't is true
722,II.,He warred with one weak woman and her few.
723,II.,
724,II.,
725,III.,III.
726,III.,
727,III.,"Lady Isolda of the Moated Manse,"
728,III.,"Whom here, that very noon, it happened me"
729,III.,To meet near her old home. A single glance
730,III.,Told me 't was she. I marveled much to see
731,III.,"How lovely still she was! as fair, perchance,"
732,III.,"As when Red Rupert thrust her brutally,--"
733,III.,"Her long hair loosened,--down the shattered stair,"
734,III.,"And cast her, shrieking, 'mid his followers there."
735,III.,
736,III.,
737,IV.,IV.
738,IV.,
739,IV.,"""She is for you! Take her! I promised it!"
740,IV.,"She is for you!""--he shouted, as he flung"
741,IV.,"Her in their midst. Then, on her poor hands (split,"
742,IV.,And beaten by his dagger when she clung
743,IV.,"Resisting him) and knees, she crept a bit"
744,IV.,Nearer his feet and begged for death. No tongue
745,IV.,"Can tell the way he turned from her and cursed,"
746,IV.,Then bade his men draw lots for which were first.
747,IV.,
748,IV.,
749,V.,V.
750,V.,
751,V.,"I saw it all from that low parapet,"
752,V.,"Where, bullet-wounded in the hip and head,"
753,V.,"I lay face-upward in the whispering wet,"
754,V.,Exhausted 'mid the dead and left for dead.
755,V.,We had held out two days without a let
756,V.,"Against these bandits. You could trace with red,"
757,V.,"From room to room, how we resisted hard"
758,V.,Since the great door crashed in to their petard.
759,V.,
760,V.,
761,VI.,VI.
762,VI.,
763,VI.,"The rain revived me, and I leaned with pain"
764,VI.,"And saw her lying there, all soiled and splashed"
765,VI.,"And miserable; on her cheek a stain,"
766,VI.,"A dull red bruise, made when his hand had dashed"
767,VI.,Her down upon the stones; the wretched rain
768,VI.,Dripped from her dark hair; and her hands were gashed.--
769,VI.,"Oh, for a musket or a petronel"
770,VI.,With which to send his devil's soul to hell!
771,VI.,
772,VI.,
773,VII.,VII.
774,VII.,
775,VII.,"But helpless there I lay, no weapon near,"
776,VII.,Only the useless sword I could not reach
777,VII.,"His traitor's heart with, while I chafed to hear"
778,VII.,"The laugh, the insult and the villain speech"
779,VII.,"Of him to her. Oh, God! could I but clear"
780,VII.,"The height between and, hanging like a leech,"
781,VII.,"My fingers at his throat, there tear his base"
782,VII.,"Vile tongue out, yea, and lash it in his face!"
783,VII.,
784,VII.,
785,VIII.,VIII.
786,VIII.,
787,VIII.,"But, badly wounded, what could I but weep"
788,VIII.,With rage and pity of my helplessness
789,VIII.,And her misfortune! Could I only creep
790,VIII.,A little nearer so that she might guess
791,VIII.,I was not dead; that I my life would keep
792,VIII.,"But to avenge her!--Oh, the wild distress"
793,VIII.,"Of that last moment when, half-dead, I saw"
794,VIII.,Them mount and bear her swooning through the shaw.
795,VIII.,
796,VIII.,
797,IX.,IX.
798,IX.,
799,IX.,Long time I lay unconscious. It befell
800,IX.,"Some woodsmen found me, having heard the sound"
801,IX.,"Of fighting cease that, for two days, made dell"
802,IX.,And dingle echo; ventured on the ground
803,IX.,For plunder; and it had not then gone well
804,IX.,"With me, I fear, had not their leader found"
805,IX.,That in some way I would repay his care;
806,IX.,So bore me to his hut and nursed me there.
807,IX.,
808,IX.,
809,X.,X.
810,X.,
811,X.,How roughly kind he was. For weeks I hung
812,X.,"'Twixt life and death; health, like a varying, sick,"
813,X.,"And fluttering pendulum, now this way swung,"
814,X.,"Now that, until at last its querulous tick"
815,X.,"Beat out life's usual time, and slowly rung"
816,X.,"The long loud hours that exclaimed, ""Be quick!--"
817,X.,Arise--Go forth!--Hear how her black wrongs call!--
818,X.,"Make them the salve to cure thy wounds withal!"""

821,XI.,XI.
822,XI.,
823,XI.,"They were my balsam: for, ere autumn came,"
824,XI.,"Weak still, but over eager to be gone,"
825,XI.,I took my leave of him. A little lame
826,XI.,"From that hip-wound, and somewhat thin and wan,"
827,XI.,I sought the village. Here I heard her name
828,XI.,"And shame's made one. How Rupert passed one dawn,"
829,XI.,And she among his troopers rode--astride
830,XI.,Like any man--pale-faced and feverish-eyed.
831,XI.,
832,XII.,XII.
833,XII.,
834,XII.,"Which way these took they pointed, and I went"
835,XII.,"Like fire after. Oh, the thought was good"
836,XII.,That they were on before! And much it meant
837,XII.,"To know she lived still; she, whose image stood"
838,XII.,"Ever before me, making turbulent"
839,XII.,"Each heart-beat with her wrongs, that were fierce food"
840,XII.,"Unto my hate that, ""Courage!"" cried, ""Rest not!"
841,XII.,"Think of her there, and let thy haste be hot!"""
842,XII.,
843,XIII.,XIII.
844,XIII.,
845,XIII.,But months passed by and still I had not found:
846,XIII.,"Yet here and there, as wearily I sought,"
847,XIII.,I caught some news: how he had held his ground
848,XIII.,Against the Roundhead troops; or how he'd fought
849,XIII.,"Then fled, returned and conquered. Like a hound,"
850,XIII.,"Questing a boar, I followed; but was brought"
851,XIII.,Never to see my quarry. Day by day
852,XIII.,It seemed that Satan kept him from my way.
853,XIII.,
854,XIII.,
855,XIV.,XIV.
856,XIV.,
857,XIV.,"A woman rode beside him, so they said,"
858,XIV.,"A fair-faced wanton, mounted like a man--"
859,XIV.,"Isolda!--my Isolda!--better dead,"
860,XIV.,"Yea, dead and damned! than thus the courtesan,"
861,XIV.,"Bold, unreluctant, of such men! A dread,"
862,XIV.,"That such should be, unmanned me. Doubt began"
863,XIV.,"To whisper at my heart.--But I was mad,"
864,XIV.,"To insult her with such thoughts, whose love I had."
865,XIV.,
866,XIV.,
867,XV.,XV.
868,XV.,
869,XV.,At last one day I rested in a glade
870,XV.,Near that same woodland which I lay in when
871,XV.,"Sore wounded; and, while sitting in the shade"
872,XV.,"Of an old beech--what! did I dream, or men"
873,XV.,Like Rupert's own ride near me? and a maid--
874,XV.,Isolda or her spirit!--Wildly then
875,XV.,"I rose and, shouting, leapt upon my horse;"
876,XV.,Unsheathed my sword and rode across their course.
877,XV.,
878,XV.,
879,XVI.,XVI.
880,XVI.,
881,XVI.,"Mainly I looked for Rupert, and by name"
882,XVI.,"Challenged him forth:--""Dog! dost thou hide behind?--"
883,XVI.,Insulter of women! Coward! save where shame
884,XVI.,"And rapine call thee! God at last is kind,"
885,XVI.,"And my sword waits!""--Like an upbeating flame,"
886,XVI.,My voice rose to a windy shout; and blind
887,XVI.,"I seemed to sit, till, with an outstretched hand,"
888,XVI.,Isolda rode before me from that band.
889,XVI.,
890,XVI.,
891,XVII.,XVII.
892,XVII.,
893,XVII.,"""Gerald!"" she cried; not as a heart surprised"
894,XVII.,"With gladness that the loved, deemed dead, still lives;"
895,XVII.,But like the heart that long hath realized
896,XVII.,Only misfortune and to fortune gives
897,XVII.,"No confidence, though it be recognized"
898,XVII.,"As good. She spoke: ""Lo, we are fugitives."
899,XVII.,"Rupert is slain. And I am going home."""
900,XVII.,"Then like a child asked simply, ""Wilt thou come?..."
901,XVII.,

906,XVIII.,"What shame, what vileness! Once my soul was clean--"
907,XVIII.,Stained and defiled behold it!--I have trod
908,XVIII.,Sad ways of hell and horror. I have seen
909,XVIII.,"And lived all depths of lust. Yet, oh, my God!"
910,XVIII.,"Blameless I hold myself of what hath been,"
911,XVIII.,"Though through it all, yea, this thou too must know,"

916,XIX.,
917,XIX.,"Sobbing she spoke as if but half awake,"
918,XIX.,"Her eyes far-fixed beyond me, far beyond"
919,XIX.,"All hope of mine.--So it was for his sake,"
920,XIX.,"His love, that she had suffered!... blind and fond,"
921,XIX.,"For what return!... And I to nurse a snake,"
922,XIX.,And never dream its nature would respond
923,XIX.,With some such fang of venom! 'T was for this
924,XIX.,"That I had ventured all, to find her his!"

926,XIX.,
927,XX.,XX.
928,XX.,
929,XX.,"At first half-stunned I stood; then blood and brain,"
930,XX.,"Like two stern judges, who had slept, awoke,"
931,XX.,"Rose up and thundered, ""Slay her!"" Every vein"
932,XX.,"And nerve responded, ""Slay her at a stroke!""--"
933,XX.,"And I had done it, but my heart again,"
934,XX.,"Like a strong captain in a tumult, spoke,"
935,XX.,And the fierce discord fell. And quietly
936,XX.,"I sheathed my sword and said, ""I'll go with thee."""
937,XX.,
938,XX.,
939,XXI.,XXI.
940,XXI.,
941,XXI.,"But this was my reward for all I'd borne,"
942,XXI.,My loyalty and love! To see her eyes
943,XXI.,Hollow from tears for him; her pale cheeks worn
944,XXI.,"With grief for him; to know them all for lies,"
945,XXI.,"Her vows of faith to me; to come forlorn,"
946,XXI.,"Where I had hoped to come on Paradise,"
947,XXI.,"On Hell's black gulf; and, as if not enough,"
948,XXI.,"Soiled as she was and outcast, still to love!"
949,XXI.,
950,XXI.,
951,XXII.,XXII.
952,XXII.,
953,XXII.,"Then rode one ruffian from the rest, clay-flecked"
954,XXII.,"From spur to plume with hurry; seized my rein,"
955,XXII.,"And--""What art thou,"" demanded, ""who hast checked"
956,XXII.,"Our way, and challenged?""--Then, with some disdain,"
957,XXII.,"Isolda, ""Sir, my kinsman did expect"
958,XXII.,Your captain here. What honor may remain
959,XXII.,To me I pledge for him. Hold off thy hands!
960,XXII.,"He but attends me to the Moated Manse."""
961,XXII.,
962,XXII.,
963,XXIII.,XXIII.
964,XXIII.,
965,XXIII.,We rode in silence. And at twilight came
966,XXIII.,Into the Moated Manse.--Great clouds had grown
967,XXIII.,"Up in the West, on which the sunset's flame"
968,XXIII.,Lay like the hand of slaughter.--Very lone
969,XXIII.,"Its rooms and halls: a splintered door that, lame,"
970,XXIII.,Swung on one hinge; a cabinet o'erthrown;
971,XXIII.,"Or arras torn; or blood-stain turning wan,"
972,XXIII.,Showed us the way the battle once had gone.
973,XXIII.,
974,XXIII.,
975,XXIV.,XXIV.
976,XXIV.,
977,XXIV.,"We reached the tower-chamber towards the West,"
978,XXIV.,In which on that dark day she thought to hide
979,XXIV.,"From Rupert when, at last, 't was manifest"
980,XXIV.,We could not hold the Manse. There was no pride
981,XXIV.,In her deep eyes now; nor did scorn invest
982,XXIV.,Her with such dignity as once defied
983,XXIV.,Him bursting in to find her standing here
984,XXIV.,Prepared to die like some dog-hunted deer.
985,XXIV.,
986,XXIV.,
987,XXV.,XXV.
988,XXV.,
989,XXV.,"She took my hand, and, as if naught of love"
990,XXV.,"Had ever been between us, said,--""All know"
991,XXV.,The madness of that day when with his glove
992,XXV.,"He struck then slew my brother, and brought woe"
993,XXV.,"On all our house; and thou, incensed above"
994,XXV.,"The rest, came here, and made my foe thy foe."
995,XXV.,But he had left. 'T was then I promised thee
996,XXV.,"My hand, but, ah! my heart was gone from me."
997,XXV.,
998,XXV.,
999,XXVI.,XXVI.
1000,XXVI.,
1001,XXVI.,"""Yea, he had won me, this same Rupert, when"
1002,XXVI.,He was our guest.--Thou know'st how gallantry
1003,XXVI.,And beauty can make heroes of all men
1004,XXVI.,To us weak women!--And so secretly
1005,XXVI.,I vowed to be his wife. It happened then
1006,XXVI.,My brother found him in some villainy;
1007,XXVI.,The insult followed; he was killed ... and thou
1008,XXVI.,Dost still remember how I made a vow.
1009,XXVI.,
1010,XXVI.,
1011,XXVII.,XXVII.
1012,XXVII.,
1013,XXVII.,"""But still this man pursued me, and I held"
1014,XXVII.,"Firm to my vow, albeit I loved him still,"
1015,XXVII.,"Unknown to all, with all the love unquelled"
1016,XXVII.,"Of first impressions, and against my will."
1017,XXVII.,At last despair of winning me compelled
1018,XXVII.,"Him to the oath he swore: He would not kill,"
1019,XXVII.,But take me living and would make my life
1020,XXVII.,A living death. No man should make me wife.

1022,XXVII.,
1023,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
1024,XXVIII.,
1025,XXVIII.,"The war, that now consumes us, did, indeed,"
1026,XXVIII.,"Give him occasion.--I had not been warned,"
1027,XXVIII.,When down he came against me in the lead
1028,XXVIII.,Of his marauders. With thy help I scorned
1029,XXVIII.,His mad attacks two days. I would not plead
1030,XXVIII.,"Nor parley with him, who came hoofed and horned,"
1031,XXVIII.,"Like Satan's self in soul, and, with his aid,"
1032,XXVIII.,Took this strong house and kept the oath he made.
1033,XXVIII.,

1037,XXIX.,"""Months passed. Alas! it needs not here to tell"
1038,XXIX.,What often thou hast heard--Of how he led
1039,XXIX.,His troopers here now there; nor what befell
1040,XXIX.,"Me of dishonor. Oft I wished me dead,"
1041,XXIX.,"Loathing my life, than which the nether hell"
1042,XXIX.,Hath less of horror ... So we fought or fled
1043,XXIX.,"From place to place until a year had passed,"
1044,XXIX.,And Parliament forces hemmed us in at last.

1051,XXX.,"Contended in my bosom when, that night"
1052,XXX.,"Before the fight that should decide our fate,"
1053,XXX.,I entered where he slept. There was no light
1054,XXX.,Save of the stars to see by. Long and late
1055,XXX.,"I leaned above him there, yet could not kill--"

1063,XXXI.,At this long-waited moment!--Wave on wave
1064,XXXI.,"Of pitying weakness swept me, and I bent"
1065,XXXI.,And kissed his face. Then prayed to God; and gave
1066,XXXI.,My trust to God; and left to God th' event.--
1067,XXXI.,"I never looked on Rupert's face again,"
1068,XXXI.,For in that morning's combat--he was slain.

1076,XXXII.,"And in their road, good as a fortress, lay"
1077,XXXII.,"The Moated Manse, where their three score or more"
1078,XXXII.,"Might well hold out, I pointed them the way."
1079,XXXII.,"And they are come, amid its wrecks to end"

1089,XXXIII.,"Yea, dost thou think I'd have thee die 'mid men"
1090,XXXIII.,"Like these, for such an one as I!--No! no!--"
1091,XXXIII.,Thy life is clean. Thou shalt not cast away

1096,XXXIV.,
1097,XXXIV.,She ceased. I spoke--I know not what it was.
1098,XXXIV.,Then took her hand and kissed it and so said--
1099,XXXIV.,"""Thou art my promised wife. Thou hast no cause"
1100,XXXIV.,That is not mine. I love thee. We will wed.
1101,XXXIV.,"I love thee. Come!""--A moment did she pause,"
1102,XXXIV.,"Then shook her head and sighed, ""My heart is dead."
1103,XXXIV.,"This can not be. Behold, that way is thine."

1108,XXXV.,
1109,XXXV.,Then turning from me ere I could prevent
1110,XXXV.,"Passed like a shadow from the shadowy room,"
1111,XXXV.,Leaving my soul in shadow ... Naught was meant
1112,XXXV.,By my sweet flower of love then! bloom by bloom
1113,XXXV.,"I'd watched it wither; then its fragrance went,"
1114,XXXV.,"And naught was left now.--It was dark as doom,"
1115,XXXV.,"And bells were tolling far off through the rain,"
1116,XXXV.,When from that house I turned my face again.
1117,XXXV.,
1118,XXXV.,
1119,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
1120,XXXVI.,
1121,XXXVI.,Then in the night a trumpet; and the dull
1122,XXXVI.,Close thud of horse and clash of Puritan arms;
1123,XXXVI.,And glimmering helms swept by me. Sorrowful
1124,XXXVI.,I stood and waited till upon the storm's
1125,XXXVI.,"Black breast, the Manse, a burning carbuncle,"
1126,XXXVI.,"Blazed like a battle-beacon, and alarms"
1127,XXXVI.,"Of onslaught clanged around it; then, like one"
1128,XXXVI.,"Who bears with him God's curse, I galloped on."
1129,XXXVI.,
1130,XXXVI.,
1131,XXXVI.,
1132,XXXVI.,
1133,XXXVI.,The Forester
1134,XXXVI.,
1135,XXXVI.,
1136,XXXVI.,I met him here at Ammendorf one Spring.
1137,XXXVI.,"It was the end of April and the Harz,"
1138,XXXVI.,"Veined to their ruin-crested summits, seemed"
1139,XXXVI.,"One pulse of tender green and delicate gold,"
1140,XXXVI.,Beneath a heaven that was like the face
1141,XXXVI.,Of girlhood waking into motherhood.
1142,XXXVI.,"Along the furrowed meadow, freshly ploughed,"
1143,XXXVI.,"The patient oxen, loamy to the knees,"
1144,XXXVI.,Plodded or lowed or snuffed the fragrant soil;
1145,XXXVI.,And in each thorntree hedge the wild bird sang
1146,XXXVI.,"A song to Spring, made of its own wild heart"
1147,XXXVI.,"And soul, that heard the dairy-maiden May's"
1148,XXXVI.,"Heart beating like a star at break of day,"
1149,XXXVI.,"As, kissing ripe the blossoms, she drew near,"
1150,XXXVI.,Her mouth's sweet rose all dew-drops and perfume.
1151,XXXVI.,Here at this inn and underneath this tree
1152,XXXVI.,"We took our wine, the morning prismed in its"
1153,XXXVI.,Flame-angled gold.--A goodly vintage that!
1154,XXXVI.,Tang with the ripeness of full twenty years.
1155,XXXVI.,"Rare! I remember!--wine that spurred the blood,"
1156,XXXVI.,"That brought the heart glad to the limbered lip,"
1157,XXXVI.,And made the eyes unlatticed casements where
1158,XXXVI.,A man's true soul you could not help but see.
1159,XXXVI.,"As royal a Rhenish, I will vouch to say,"
1160,XXXVI.,"As that, old legends tell, which Necromance"
1161,XXXVI.,"And Magic keep, gnome-guarded, in huge casks"
1162,XXXVI.,"Of antique make deep in the Kyffhäuser,"
1163,XXXVI.,The Cellar of the Knights near Sittendorf.--
1164,XXXVI.,So solaced of that wine we sat an hour.
1165,XXXVI.,He told me his intent in coming here.
1166,XXXVI.,"His name was Rudolf; and his native home,"
1167,XXXVI.,Franconia; but no word of parentage:
1168,XXXVI.,Only his mind to don the buff and green
1169,XXXVI.,And live a forester with us and be
1170,XXXVI.,"Enfellowed in the Duke of Brunswick's train,"
1171,XXXVI.,And for the Duke's estate even now was bound.
1172,XXXVI.,"Tall was he for his age and strong and brown,"
1173,XXXVI.,And lithe of limb; and with a face that seemed
1174,XXXVI.,Hope's counterpart--but with the eyes of doubt;
1175,XXXVI.,"Deep restless disks, instinct with gleaming night,"
1176,XXXVI.,"That seemed to say, ""We're sure of earth, at least"
1177,XXXVI.,"For some short space, my friend; but afterward--"
1178,XXXVI.,"Nay! ransack not to-morrow till to-day,"
1179,XXXVI.,"Lest it engulf thy joy before it is!""--"
1180,XXXVI.,"And when he spoke, the fire in his eyes"
1181,XXXVI.,Worked stealthy as a hunted animal's;
1182,XXXVI.,"Or like the Count von Hackelnburg's that turn,"
1183,XXXVI.,Feeling the unseen presence of a fiend.
1184,XXXVI.,"Then, as it chanced, old Kurt had come that morn"
1185,XXXVI.,With some six of his jerkined foresters
1186,XXXVI.,"From the Thuringian forest; wet with dew,"
1187,XXXVI.,And fresh as morn with early travel; bound
1188,XXXVI.,"For Brunswick, Dummburg and the Hakel passed."
1189,XXXVI.,"Chief huntsman he then to our lord the Duke,"
1190,XXXVI.,And father of the loveliest maiden here
1191,XXXVI.,"In Ammendorf, the sunny Ilsabe:"
1192,XXXVI.,"Her mother dead, the gray-haired father prized"
1193,XXXVI.,His daughter more than all that men hold dear;
1194,XXXVI.,"His only happiness, who was beloved"
1195,XXXVI.,"Of all as Lora of Thuringia was,"
1196,XXXVI.,"For gentle ways that spoke a noble soul,"
1197,XXXVI.,"Winning all hearts to love her and to praise,"
1198,XXXVI.,As might a great and beautiful thought that holds
1199,XXXVI.,Us by the simplest words.--Her eyes were blue
1200,XXXVI.,As the high influence of a summer day.
1201,XXXVI.,"Her hair,--serene and braided over brows"
1202,XXXVI.,"White as a Harz dove's wing,--was auburn brown,"
1203,XXXVI.,And deep as mists the sun has drenched with gold.
1204,XXXVI.,"And her young presence--well, 't was like a song,"
1205,XXXVI.,"A far Tyrolean melody of love,"
1206,XXXVI.,Heard on an Alpine path at close of day
1207,XXXVI.,When shepherds homeward lead their tinkling flocks.
1208,XXXVI.,"And when she left, being with you awhile,--"
1209,XXXVI.,How shall I say it?--'t was as when one hath
1210,XXXVI.,"Beheld an Undine by the moonlit Rhine,"
1211,XXXVI.,"Who, ere the mind adjusts a thought, is gone,"
1212,XXXVI.,And in your soul you wonder if a dream.
1213,XXXVI.,"Some thirty years ago it was;--and I,"
1214,XXXVI.,Commissioner of the Duke--(no sinecure
1215,XXXVI.,I can assure you)--had scarce reached the age
1216,XXXVI.,"Of thirty,--that we sat here at our wine;"
1217,XXXVI.,"And 't was through me that Rudolf,--whom at first,"
1218,XXXVI.,"From some rash words dropped then in argument,"
1219,XXXVI.,"The foresterhood was like to be denied,--"
1220,XXXVI.,"Was then enfellowed. ""Yes,"" said I, ""he's young."
1221,XXXVI.,"Kurt, he is young; but see, a wiry frame;"
1222,XXXVI.,A chamois footing and a face for deeds;
1223,XXXVI.,An eye that likes me not; too quick to turn;
1224,XXXVI.,But that may be the restless soul within;
1225,XXXVI.,A soul perhaps with virtues that have been
1226,XXXVI.,Severely tried and could not stand the test;
1227,XXXVI.,"These be thy care, Kurt; and if not too deep"
1228,XXXVI.,"In vices of the flesh, discover them,"
1229,XXXVI.,As divers bring lost riches up from ooze.
1230,XXXVI.,"Thou hast a daughter; let him be thy son."""
1231,XXXVI.,A year thereafter was it that I heard
1232,XXXVI.,Of Rudolf's passion for Kurt's Ilsabe;
1233,XXXVI.,"Then their betrothal. And it was from this,--"
1234,XXXVI.,Good Mother Mary! how she haunts me still!
1235,XXXVI.,"Sweet Ilsabe! whose higher womanhood,"
1236,XXXVI.,True as the touchstone which philosophers feign
1237,XXXVI.,"Transmutes to gold base metals it may touch,"
1238,XXXVI.,"Had turned to good all evil in this man,--"
1239,XXXVI.,Surmised I of the excellency which
1240,XXXVI.,"Refinement of her purer company,"
1241,XXXVI.,"And contact with her innocence, had resolved"
1242,XXXVI.,"His fiery nature to, conditioning slave."
1243,XXXVI.,"And so I came from Brunswick--as, you know,"
1244,XXXVI.,"Is custom of the Duke or, by his seal"
1245,XXXVI.,"Commissioned proxy, his commissioner--"
1246,XXXVI.,"To test the marksmanship of Rudolf, who"
1247,XXXVI.,"Succeeded Kurt with marriage of his child,"
1248,XXXVI.,An heir of Kuno.--He?--Greatgrandfather
1249,XXXVI.,Of Kurt; and of this forestkeepership
1250,XXXVI.,The first possessor; thus established here--
1251,XXXVI.,Or this the tale they tell on winter nights:
1252,XXXVI.,"Kuno, once in the Knight of Wippach's train,"
1253,XXXVI.,"Rode on a grand hunt with the Duke, who came,--"
1254,XXXVI.,"Grandfather of the father of our Duke,--"
1255,XXXVI.,"With much magnificence of knights and squires,"
1256,XXXVI.,"Great velvet-vestured nobles, cloaked and plumed,"
1257,XXXVI.,"To hunt Thuringian deer. Then morn,--too quick"
1258,XXXVI.,"To bid good-morrow,--was too slow for these,"
1259,XXXVI.,And on the wind-trod hills recumbent yawned
1260,XXXVI.,"Disturbed an hour too soon; all sleepy-eyed,"
1261,XXXVI.,"Like some young milkmaid whom the cock hath roused,"
1262,XXXVI.,Who sits and rubs stiff eyes that still will close.
1263,XXXVI.,"Horns sang and deer-hounds tugged a whimpering leash,"
1264,XXXVI.,"Or, loosened, bounded through the baying glens:"
1265,XXXVI.,"And ere the mountain mists, compact of white,"
1266,XXXVI.,"Broke wild before the azure spears of day,"
1267,XXXVI.,"The far-off hunt, that woke the woods to life,"
1268,XXXVI.,Seemed but the heart-beat of the ancient hills.
1269,XXXVI.,"And then, near noon, within a forest brake,"
1270,XXXVI.,"The ban-dogs roused a red gigantic stag,"
1271,XXXVI.,"Lashed to whose back with gnarly-knotted cords,"
1272,XXXVI.,"And borne along like some pale parasite,"
1273,XXXVI.,"A man shrieked: tangle-bearded, and wild hair"
1274,XXXVI.,"A mane of forest-burs. The man himself,"
1275,XXXVI.,Emaciated and half-naked from
1276,XXXVI.,"The stag's mad flight through headlong rocks and trees,"
1277,XXXVI.,"One bleeding bruise, with eyes like holes of fire."
1278,XXXVI.,For such the law then: when the peasant chased
1279,XXXVI.,"Or slew the dun deer of his tyrant lords,"
1280,XXXVI.,"If seized, as punishment the withes and spine"
1281,XXXVI.,"Of some strong stag, a gift to him of game,"
1282,XXXVI.,"Enough till death--death in the antlered herd,"
1283,XXXVI.,Or slow starvation in the haggard hills.
1284,XXXVI.,"Then was the great Duke glad, and forthwith cried"
1285,XXXVI.,To all his hunting train a rich reward
1286,XXXVI.,"For him who slew the stag and saved the man,"
1287,XXXVI.,But death for him who slew both man and stag.
1288,XXXVI.,"So plunged the hunt after the hurrying slot,"
1289,XXXVI.,"A shout and glimmer through the sounding woods,--"
1290,XXXVI.,Like some mad torrent that the hills have loosed
1291,XXXVI.,With death for goal.--'T was late; and none had risked
1292,XXXVI.,"That shot as yet,--too desperate the risk"
1293,XXXVI.,"Beside the poor life and a little gold,--"
1294,XXXVI.,"When this young Kuno, with fierce eyes, wherein"
1295,XXXVI.,"Hunt and impatience kindled reckless flame,"
1296,XXXVI.,"Cried, ""Has the dew then made our powder wet?"
1297,XXXVI.,Or have we left our marksmanship at home?
1298,XXXVI.,"Here's for its heart! the Fiend direct my ball!""--"
1299,XXXVI.,"And fired into a covert deeply packed,"
1300,XXXVI.,"An intertangled wall of matted night,"
1301,XXXVI.,Wherein the eye might vainly strive and strive
1302,XXXVI.,"To pierce one fathom, earn one foot beyond."
1303,XXXVI.,"But, ha! the huge stag staggered from the brake"
1304,XXXVI.,"Hit full i' the heart. And that wan wretch, unbound,"
1305,XXXVI.,"Was ta'en and cared for. Then his grace, the Duke,"
1306,XXXVI.,"Charmed with the eagle aim, called Kuno up,"
1307,XXXVI.,And there to him and his forever gave
1308,XXXVI.,The forestkeepership.
1309,XXXVI.,But envious tongues
1310,XXXVI.,Were soon at wag; and whispered went the tale
1311,XXXVI.,"Of how the shot was free, and how the balls"
1312,XXXVI.,Used by young Kuno were free bullets--which
1313,XXXVI.,"To say is: Lead by magic moulded, in"
1314,XXXVI.,"The influence and directed, of the Fiend."
1315,XXXVI.,"Of some effect these tales, and had some force"
1316,XXXVI.,"Even with the Duke, who lent an ear so far"
1317,XXXVI.,As to ordain Kuno's descendants all
1318,XXXVI.,To proof of skill ere their succession to
1319,XXXVI.,The father's office. Kurt himself hath shot
1320,XXXVI.,The silver ring out o' the popinjay's beak--
1321,XXXVI.,"A good shot he, you see, who would succeed."
1322,XXXVI.,Of these enchanted bullets let me speak:
1323,XXXVI.,"There may be such; our Earth has things as strange,"
1324,XXXVI.,"Perhaps, and stranger, that we doubt not of,"
1325,XXXVI.,"While we behold, not only 'neath the thatch"
1326,XXXVI.,"Of Ignorance's hovel, but within"
1327,XXXVI.,"The pictured halls of Wisdom's palaces,"
1328,XXXVI.,How Superstition sits an honored guest.
1329,XXXVI.,A cross-way let it be among the hills;
1330,XXXVI.,A cross-way in a solitude of pines;
1331,XXXVI.,And on the lonely cross-way you must draw
1332,XXXVI.,A blood-red circle with a bloody sword;
1333,XXXVI.,"And round the circle, runic characters,"
1334,XXXVI.,"Gaunt and satanic; here a skull, and there"
1335,XXXVI.,"A scythe and cross-bones, and an hour-glass here;"
1336,XXXVI.,"And in the centre, fed with coffin-wood,"
1337,XXXVI.,"Stol'n from the grave of one, a murderer,"
1338,XXXVI.,A smouldering fire. Eleven of the clock
1339,XXXVI.,The first ball leaves the mold--the sullen lead
1340,XXXVI.,"Mixed with three bullets that have hit their mark,"
1341,XXXVI.,"And blood, the wounded Sacramental Host"
1342,XXXVI.,"Stolen, and hence unhallowed, oozed, when shot"
1343,XXXVI.,Fixed to a riven pine. Ere twelve o'clock
1344,XXXVI.,"With never a word until that hour sound,"
1345,XXXVI.,Must all the balls be cast; and these must be
1346,XXXVI.,In number three and sixty; three of which
1347,XXXVI.,"The Fiend's dark agent, demon Sammael,"
1348,XXXVI.,Claims for his master and stamps for his own
1349,XXXVI.,"To hit aside their mark, askew for harm."
1350,XXXVI.,The other sixty shall not miss their mark.
1351,XXXVI.,"No cry, no word, no whisper, even though"
1352,XXXVI.,"Vague, gesturing shapes, that loom like moonlit mists,"
1353,XXXVI.,"Their faces human but with animal forms,"
1354,XXXVI.,Rise thick around and threaten to destroy.
1355,XXXVI.,"No cry, no word, no whisper should there come,"
1356,XXXVI.,"Weeping, a wandering shadow like the girl"
1357,XXXVI.,"You love, or loved, now lost to you, her eyes"
1358,XXXVI.,Hollow with tears; all palely beckoning
1359,XXXVI.,"With beautiful arms, or censuring; her face"
1360,XXXVI.,"Sad with a desolate love; who, if you speak"
1361,XXXVI.,Or waver from that circle--hideous change!--
1362,XXXVI.,"Shrinks to a wrinkled hag, whose harpy hands"
1363,XXXVI.,Shall tear you limb from limb with horrible mirth.
1364,XXXVI.,Nor be deceived if some far midnight bell
1365,XXXVI.,Strike that anticipated hour; nor leave
1366,XXXVI.,"By one short inch the circle, for, unseen"
1367,XXXVI.,"Though now they be, Hell's minions still are there,"
1368,XXXVI.,Watching with flaming eyes to seize your soul.
1369,XXXVI.,"But when the hour of midnight sounds, be sure"
1370,XXXVI.,"You have your bullets, neither more nor less;"
1371,XXXVI.,"For if through fear one more or less you have,"
1372,XXXVI.,Your soul is forfeit to Hell's majesty.--
1373,XXXVI.,"Then while the hour of midnight strikes, will come"
1374,XXXVI.,"A noise of galloping hoofs and outriders,"
1375,XXXVI.,"Shouting; six midnight steeds,--their nostrils, pits"
1376,XXXVI.,"Of burning blood,--postilioned, roll a stage,"
1377,XXXVI.,Black and with groaning wheels of spinning fire:
1378,XXXVI.,"""Room there!--ho! ho!--who bars the mountain-way?"
1379,XXXVI.,"On over him!""--But fear not, nor fare forth;"
1380,XXXVI.,'T is but the last trick of your bounden slave.
1381,XXXVI.,And ere the red moon rushes through the clouds
1382,XXXVI.,"And dives again, high the huge leaders leap,"
1383,XXXVI.,"Their fore-hoofs fire, and their eye-balls flame,"
1384,XXXVI.,"And, spun a spiral spark into the night,"
1385,XXXVI.,Whistling the phantom flies and fades away.
1386,XXXVI.,"Some say there comes no stage; that Hackelnburg,"
1387,XXXVI.,"Wild-huntsman of the Harz, comes dark as storm,"
1388,XXXVI.,"With rain and wind and demon dogs of Hell,"
1389,XXXVI.,"The terror of his hunting-horn, an owl,"
1390,XXXVI.,"And the dim deer he hunts, rush on before;"
1391,XXXVI.,"The forests crash, and whirlwinds are the leaves,"
1392,XXXVI.,"And all the skies a-thunder, as he hurls"
1393,XXXVI.,"Straight on the circle, horse and hounds and stag."
1394,XXXVI.,"And at the last, plutonian-cloaked, there comes,"
1395,XXXVI.,"Upon a stallion gaunt and lurid black,"
1396,XXXVI.,"The minister of Satan, Sammael,"
1397,XXXVI.,"Who greets you, and informs you, and assures."
1398,XXXVI.,"Enough! these wives'-tales told, to what I've seen:"
1399,XXXVI.,To Ammendorf I came; and Rudolf here
1400,XXXVI.,"With Kurt and his assembled men, I met."
1401,XXXVI.,"The abundant year,--like some sweet wife,--a-smile"
1402,XXXVI.,"At her brown baby, Autumn, in her arms,"
1403,XXXVI.,Stood 'mid the garnered harvests of her fields
1404,XXXVI.,Dreaming of days that pass like almoners
1405,XXXVI.,Scattering their alms in minted gold of flowers;
1406,XXXVI.,"Of nights, that forest all the skies with stars,"
1407,XXXVI.,"Wherethrough the moon--bare-bosomed huntress--rides,"
1408,XXXVI.,One cloud before her like a flying fawn.
1409,XXXVI.,Then I proposed the season's hunt; till eve
1410,XXXVI.,"The test of Rudolf's skill postponed, at which"
1411,XXXVI.,He seemed impatient. And 't was then I heard
1412,XXXVI.,How he an execrable marksman was;
1413,XXXVI.,"And tales that told of near, incredible shots,"
1414,XXXVI.,That missed their mark; or how his flint-lock oft
1415,XXXVI.,"Flashed harmless powder, while the curious deer"
1416,XXXVI.,Stood staring; as in pity of such aim
1417,XXXVI.,Bidding him try his marksmanship again.
1418,XXXVI.,"Howbeit, he that day acquitted him"
1419,XXXVI.,Of all this gossip; in that day's long hunt
1420,XXXVI.,"Missing no shot, however rashly made"
1421,XXXVI.,Or distant through the intercepting trees.
1422,XXXVI.,"And the piled, various game brought down of all"
1423,XXXVI.,"Good marksmen of Kurt's train had not sufficed,"
1424,XXXVI.,"Doubled, nay, trebled, there to match his heap."
1425,XXXVI.,"And marvelling the hunters saw, nor knew"
1426,XXXVI.,"How to excuse them. My indulgence giv'n,"
1427,XXXVI.,Some told me that but yesterday old Kurt
1428,XXXVI.,"Had made his daughter weep and Rudolf frown,"
1429,XXXVI.,"By vowing end to their betrothéd love,"
1430,XXXVI.,Unless that love developed better aim
1431,XXXVI.,Against the morrow's test; his ancestors'
1432,XXXVI.,High fame should not be tarnished. So he railed;
1433,XXXVI.,And bowed his gray head and sat moodily;
1434,XXXVI.,"But looking up, forgave all when he saw"
1435,XXXVI.,Tears in his daughter's eyes and Rudolf gone
1436,XXXVI.,Out in the night black with approaching storm.
1437,XXXVI.,"Before this inn, yonder and here, they stood,"
1438,XXXVI.,The holiday village come to view the trial:
1439,XXXVI.,Fair maidens and their comely mothers with
1440,XXXVI.,Their sweethearts and their husbands. And I marked
1441,XXXVI.,Kurt and his daughter here; his florid face
1442,XXXVI.,All jubilant at Rudolf's great success;
1443,XXXVI.,"Hers, radiant with happiness; for this"
1444,XXXVI.,Her marriage eve--so had her father said--
1445,XXXVI.,Should Rudolf come successful from the hunt.
1446,XXXVI.,"So pleased was I with what I'd seen him do,"
1447,XXXVI.,"The trial of skill superfluous seemed, and so"
1448,XXXVI.,"Was on the bare brink of announcing, when"
1449,XXXVI.,"Out of the western heaven's deepening red,--"
1450,XXXVI.,"Like a white message dropped by rosy lips,--"
1451,XXXVI.,"A wild dove clove the luminous winds and there,"
1452,XXXVI.,"Upon that limb, a peaceful moment sat."
1453,XXXVI.,"Then I, ""Thy rifle, Rudolf! pierce its head!"""
1454,XXXVI.,"Cried pointing, ""and chief-forester art thou!""--"
1455,XXXVI.,Why did he falter with a face as strange
1456,XXXVI.,As a dark omen? did his soul foresee
1457,XXXVI.,What was to be with tragic prescience?--
1458,XXXVI.,What a bad dream it all seems now!--Again
1459,XXXVI.,"I see him aim. Again I hear the cry,"
1460,XXXVI.,"""My dove! O Rudolf, do not kill my dove!"""
1461,XXXVI.,"And from the crowd, like some sweet dove herself,"
1462,XXXVI.,"A fluttering whiteness, came our Ilsabe--"
1463,XXXVI.,Too late! the rifle cracked ... The unhurt dove
1464,XXXVI.,"Rose, beating frightened wings--but Ilsabe!..."
1465,XXXVI.,"The sight! the sight!... lay smitten; a red stain,"
1466,XXXVI.,"Sullying the pureness of her bridal bodice,"
1467,XXXVI.,Showed where the ball had pierced her through the heart.
1468,XXXVI.,"And Rudolf?--Ah, of him you still would know?--"
1469,XXXVI.,"When he beheld this thing that he had done,"
1470,XXXVI.,Why he went mad--I say--but others not.
1471,XXXVI.,An hour he raved of how her life had paid
1472,XXXVI.,"For the unholy bullets he had used,"
1473,XXXVI.,And how his soul was three times lost and damned.
1474,XXXVI.,I say that he went mad and fled forthwith
1475,XXXVI.,"Into the haunted Harz.--Some say, to die"
1476,XXXVI.,The prey of demons of the Dummburg ruin.
1477,XXXVI.,"I, one of those less superstitious, say,"
1478,XXXVI.,"He in the Bodé--from that blackened rock,--"
1479,XXXVI.,"Whereon were found his hunting-cap and gun,--"
1480,XXXVI.,"The Devil's Dancing Place, did leap and die."
1481,XXXVI.,
1482,XXXVI.,
1483,XXXVI.,
1484,XXXVI.,
1485,XXXVI.,My Lady of Verne
1486,XXXVI.,
1487,XXXVI.,
1488,XXXVI.,It all comes back as the end draws near;
1489,XXXVI.,All comes back like a tale of old!
1490,XXXVI.,Shall I tell you all? Will you lend an ear?
1491,XXXVI.,"You, with your face so stern and cold;"
1492,XXXVI.,"You, who have found me dying here ..."
1493,XXXVI.,
1494,XXXVI.,Lady Leona's villa at Verne--
1495,XXXVI.,"You have walked its terraces, where the fount"
1496,XXXVI.,And statue gleam and the fluted urn;
1497,XXXVI.,"Its world-old elms, that are avenues gaunt"
1498,XXXVI.,Of shadow and flame when the West is a-burn.
1499,XXXVI.,
1500,XXXVI.,"'T is a lonely region of tarns and trees,"
1501,XXXVI.,And hollow hills that circle the West;
1502,XXXVI.,Haunted of rooks and the far-off sea's
1503,XXXVI.,Immemorial vague unrest;
1504,XXXVI.,A land of sorrowful memories.
1505,XXXVI.,
1506,XXXVI.,"A gray sad land, where the wind has its will,"
1507,XXXVI.,And the sun its way with the fruits and flowers;
1508,XXXVI.,"Where ever the one all night is shrill,"
1509,XXXVI.,And ever the other all day brings hours
1510,XXXVI.,Of glimmering silence that dead days fill.
1511,XXXVI.,
1512,XXXVI.,"A gray sad land, where her girlhood grew"
1513,XXXVI.,"To womanhood proud, that the hill-winds seemed"
1514,XXXVI.,"To give their heart, like melody, to;"
1515,XXXVI.,"And the stars, their soul, like a dream undreamed--"
1516,XXXVI.,The only glad thing that the sad land knew.
1517,XXXVI.,
1518,XXXVI.,"My Lady, you know, how nobly born!"
1519,XXXVI.,"Haughty of form, with a head that rose"
1520,XXXVI.,Like a dream of empire; love and scorn
1521,XXXVI.,Made haunts of her eyes; and her lips were bows
1522,XXXVI.,Whence pride imperious flashed flower and thorn.
1523,XXXVI.,
1524,XXXVI.,"And I--oh, I was nobody: one"
1525,XXXVI.,Her worshiper only; who chose to be
1526,XXXVI.,"Silent, seeing that love alone"
1527,XXXVI.,"Was his only badge of nobility,"
1528,XXXVI.,Set in his heart's escutcheon.
1529,XXXVI.,
1530,XXXVI.,"How long ago does the springtime look,"
1531,XXXVI.,"When we wandered away to the hills! the hills,--"
1532,XXXVI.,"Like the land in the tale in the fairy-book,--"
1533,XXXVI.,"Covered with gold of the daffodils,"
1534,XXXVI.,And gemmed with the crocus by brae and brook!
1535,XXXVI.,
1536,XXXVI.,"When I gathered a branch from a hawthorn tree,"
1537,XXXVI.,"For her hair or bosom, from boughs that hung"
1538,XXXVI.,Odorous of heaven and purity;
1539,XXXVI.,"And she thanked me smiling; then merrily sung,"
1540,XXXVI.,"Laughingly sung, while she looked at me:--"
1541,XXXVI.,
1542,XXXVI.,"""There dwelt a princess over the sea--"
1543,XXXVI.,"Right fair was she, right fair was she--"
1544,XXXVI.,"Who loved a squire of low degree,"
1545,XXXVI.,But married a king of Brittany--
1546,XXXVI.,"Ah, woe is me!"
1547,XXXVI.,
1548,XXXVI.,"""And it came to pass on the wedding-day--"
1549,XXXVI.,"So people say, so people say--"
1550,XXXVI.,"That they found her dead in her bridal array,"
1551,XXXVI.,"Dead, and her lover beside her lay--"
1552,XXXVI.,"Ah, well-away!"
1553,XXXVI.,
1554,XXXVI.,"""A sour stave for your sweets,"" she said,"
1555,XXXVI.,Pressing the blossoms against her lips:
1556,XXXVI.,"Then petal by petal the branch she shred,"
1557,XXXVI.,"Snowing the blooms from her finger-tips,"
1558,XXXVI.,Tossing them down for her feet to tread.
1559,XXXVI.,
1560,XXXVI.,What to her was the look I gave
1561,XXXVI.,"Of love despised! though she seemed to start,"
1562,XXXVI.,"Seeing, and said, with a quick hand-wave,"
1563,XXXVI.,"""Why, one would think that _that_ was your heart,"""
1564,XXXVI.,While her face with a sudden thought grew grave.
1565,XXXVI.,
1566,XXXVI.,But I answered nothing. And so to her home
1567,XXXVI.,"We came in the twilight; falling clear,"
1568,XXXVI.,"With a few first stars and a moon's curved foam,"
1569,XXXVI.,"Over the hush of meadow and mere,"
1570,XXXVI.,Whence the boom of the bittern would often come.
1571,XXXVI.,
1572,XXXVI.,Would you think that she loved me?--Who can say?--
1573,XXXVI.,What a riddle unread was she to me!--
1574,XXXVI.,When I kissed her fingers and turned away
1575,XXXVI.,"I wanted to speak, but--what cared she,"
1576,XXXVI.,Though her eyes looked soft and she begged me stay!
1577,XXXVI.,
1578,XXXVI.,Though she lingered to watch me--that might be
1579,XXXVI.,"A slim moon-beam or the evening haze,--"
1580,XXXVI.,But never my Lady's drapery
1581,XXXVI.,Or wistful face!--in the ivy maze....
1582,XXXVI.,"Leona of Verne--why, what cared she!"
1583,XXXVI.,
1584,XXXVI.,"So the days went by, and the Summer wore"
1585,XXXVI.,"Her hot heart out; and, a mighty slayer,"
1586,XXXVI.,"The Autumn harried the land and shore,"
1587,XXXVI.,And the world was red with his wrecks; but grayer
1588,XXXVI.,That land with the ghosts of the nevermore.
1589,XXXVI.,
1590,XXXVI.,The sheaves of the Summer had long been bound;
1591,XXXVI.,The harvests of Autumn had long been past;
1592,XXXVI.,"And the snows of the Winter lay deep around,"
1593,XXXVI.,When the dark news came and I knew at last;
1594,XXXVI.,And the reigning woe of my heart was crowned.
1595,XXXVI.,
1596,XXXVI.,"So I sought her here, the young Earl's bride;"
1597,XXXVI.,"In the ancient room at the oriel dreaming,"
1598,XXXVI.,"Pale as the blooms in her hair; and, wide,"
1599,XXXVI.,"Her robe's rich satin, flung stormily, gleaming,"
1600,XXXVI.,"Like shimmering silver, twilight-dyed."
1601,XXXVI.,
1602,XXXVI.,I marked as I stole to her side that tears
1603,XXXVI.,Were vaguely large in her beautiful eyes;
1604,XXXVI.,"That the loops of pearls on her throat, and years"
1605,XXXVI.,Old lace on her bosom were heaved with sighs;
1606,XXXVI.,"So I spoke what I thought--""Then, it appears""--"
1607,XXXVI.,
1608,XXXVI.,"And stopped with, it seemed, my soul in my gaze--"
1609,XXXVI.,"""That you are not happy, Leona of Verne?"
1610,XXXVI.,"There is that at your heart which--well, betrays"
1611,XXXVI.,These mocking mummeries.--Live and learn!--
1612,XXXVI.,And this is the truth that the poet says:--
1613,XXXVI.,
1614,XXXVI.,"""'I went to my love and I told with my heart,"
1615,XXXVI.,"In words of the soul, that are silent in speech,"
1616,XXXVI.,"All of my passion, too sacred for art;"
1617,XXXVI.,But she heard me not--for I could not reach
1618,XXXVI.,Her in that world of which she is part.'--
1619,XXXVI.,
1620,XXXVI.,"""That world, where I saw you as one afar"
1621,XXXVI.,"Sees palms and waters, and knows that sands,"
1622,XXXVI.,"Pitiless sands, before him are;"
1623,XXXVI.,Yet follows ever with helpless hands
1624,XXXVI.,"Till he sinks at last.--You were my star,"
1625,XXXVI.,
1626,XXXVI.,"""My hope, my heaven!--I loved you!... Life"
1627,XXXVI.,"Is less than nothing to me!""... She turned,"
1628,XXXVI.,"With a wild look, saying--""Now I am his wife"
1629,XXXVI.,You come and tell me!--Indeed you are learn'd
1630,XXXVI.,"In the language of hearts that's unheard!""... A Knife,"
1631,XXXVI.,
1632,XXXVI.,"As she ceased and leaned on a cabinet,--"
1633,XXXVI.,"A curve of scintillant steel, keen, cold,--"
1634,XXXVI.,Fell icily clashing; some curio met
1635,XXXVI.,"Among Asian antiques, bronze and gold,"
1636,XXXVI.,"Mystical, curiously graven and set."
1637,XXXVI.,
1638,XXXVI.,"A Bactrian dagger, whose slightest prick"
1639,XXXVI.,"Through its ancient poison was death, I knew;"
1640,XXXVI.,If true that she loved me--then!--And quick
1641,XXXVI.,"To the unspoken thought she replied, ""'T is true!"
1642,XXXVI.,"I have loved you long, and my soul was sick,"
1643,XXXVI.,
1644,XXXVI.,"""Sick for the love that has made me weak,"
1645,XXXVI.,"Weak to your will even now!""--And more"
1646,XXXVI.,"She said, in my arms, that I shall not speak--"
1647,XXXVI.,And the dagger there on the polished floor
1648,XXXVI.,"Ever her eyes, while she spoke, would seek."
1649,XXXVI.,
1650,XXXVI.,"""'And it came to pass on the wedding-day'""--"
1651,XXXVI.,Then my lips for a moment were crushed to hers--
1652,XXXVI.,"""'That they found her dead in her bridal array,'"""
1653,XXXVI.,"She sang; then said, ""You finish the verse!"
1654,XXXVI.,"Finish the song, for you know the way."""
1655,XXXVI.,
1656,XXXVI.,"And I whispered ""yes,"" for my mind had thought"
1657,XXXVI.,Her own thought through--that life were a hell
1658,XXXVI.,"To her as to me,--So the blade I caught"
1659,XXXVI.,"With a sudden hand; and she leaned, and--well,"
1660,XXXVI.,"What a little wound, and the blood it brought"
1661,XXXVI.,
1662,XXXVI.,To crimson her bosom!--I set her there
1663,XXXVI.,"In that carven chair; then turned the blade,--"
1664,XXXVI.,With its glittering haft one savage glare
1665,XXXVI.,"Of gold and jewels, wildly inlaid,--"
1666,XXXVI.,"To my breast, for the poisonous point rent bare."
1667,XXXVI.,
1668,XXXVI.,"A stain of blood on her bosom, and one"
1669,XXXVI.,"Black red o'er my heart.--You see, 't is good"
1670,XXXVI.,"To die so for love!... Does the sinking sun,"
1671,XXXVI.,Through the dull vast west burst banked with blood?--
1672,XXXVI.,Or is it that life will at last have done?...
1673,XXXVI.,
1674,XXXVI.,"So you are her husband? and--well, you see,"
1675,XXXVI.,"You see she is dead ... But your face, how white!"
1676,XXXVI.,--Is it with hate or with misery?--
1677,XXXVI.,"What matters it now!--For, at last, the night"
1678,XXXVI.,Falls and the silence covers me.
1679,XXXVI.,
1680,XXXVI.,
1681,XXXVI.,
1682,XXXVI.,
1683,XXXVI.,An Old Tale Re-told
1684,XXXVI.,
1685,XXXVI.,
1686,XXXVI.,"From the terrace here, where the hills indent,"
1687,XXXVI.,You can see the uttermost battlement
1688,XXXVI.,Of the castle there; the Cliffords' home;
1689,XXXVI.,Where the seasons go and the seasons come
1690,XXXVI.,And never a footstep else doth fall
1691,XXXVI.,Save the prowling fox's; the ancient hall
1692,XXXVI.,Echoes no voice save the owlet's call:
1693,XXXVI.,Its turret chambers are homes for the bat;
1694,XXXVI.,And its courts are tangled and wild to see;
1695,XXXVI.,"And where in the cellar was once the rat,"
1696,XXXVI.,The viper and toad move stealthily.
1697,XXXVI.,"Long years have passed since the place was burned,"
1698,XXXVI.,And he sailed to the wars in France and earned
1699,XXXVI.,The name that he bears of the bold and true
1700,XXXVI.,"On his tomb. Long years, since my lord, Sir Hugh,"
1701,XXXVI.,"Lived; and I was his favorite page,"
1702,XXXVI.,And the thing then happened; and he of an age
1703,XXXVI.,"When a man will love and be loved again,"
1704,XXXVI.,"Or hie to the wars or a monastery,"
1705,XXXVI.,"Or toil till he conquer his heart's sore pain,"
1706,XXXVI.,Or drink and forget it and finally bury.
1707,XXXVI.,
1708,XXXVI.,I was his page. And often we fared
1709,XXXVI.,"Through the Clare demesnes, in autumn, hawking;"
1710,XXXVI.,"If the Baron had known, how they would have glared"
1711,XXXVI.,"'Neath their bushy brows, those eyes of mocking!--"
1712,XXXVI.,"That last of the Strongbows, Richard, I mean--"
1713,XXXVI.,And growling some six of his henchmen lean
1714,XXXVI.,To mount and after this Clifford and hang
1715,XXXVI.,"With his crop-eared page to the nearest oak,"
1716,XXXVI.,How he would have cursed us while he spoke!
1717,XXXVI.,For Clare and Clifford had ever a fang
1718,XXXVI.,In the other's side ... And I hear the clang
1719,XXXVI.,Of his rage in the hall when the hawker told--
1720,XXXVI.,If he told!--how we met on the autumn wold
1721,XXXVI.,"His daughter, sweet Clara of Clare, the day"
1722,XXXVI.,"Her hooded tiercel its brails did burst,"
1723,XXXVI.,"And trailing its jesses, came flying our way--"
1724,XXXVI.,An untrained haggard the falconer cursed
1725,XXXVI.,While he tried to secure:--as the eyas flew
1726,XXXVI.,"Slant, low and heavily over us, Hugh,--"
1727,XXXVI.,"Who saw it coming, and had just then cast"
1728,XXXVI.,"His peregrine hawk at a heron quarry,--"
1729,XXXVI.,"In his saddle rising, so, as it passed,"
1730,XXXVI.,"By the jesses caught, and to her did carry,"
1731,XXXVI.,Where she stood near the wood. Her face flushed rose
1732,XXXVI.,With the glad of the meeting. No two foes
1733,XXXVI.,"Her eyes and my Lord's, I swear, who saw"
1734,XXXVI.,'Twas love from the start. And I heard him speak
1735,XXXVI.,"Some words; then he knelt; and the sombre shaw,"
1736,XXXVI.,"With the rust of the autumn waste and bleak,"
1737,XXXVI.,"Grew spring with her smile, as the hawk she took"
1738,XXXVI.,"On her lily wrist, where it pruned and shook"
1739,XXXVI.,Its ragged wings. Then I saw him seize
1740,XXXVI.,"The hand, that she reached to him, long and white,"
1741,XXXVI.,As she smilingly bade him rise from his knees--
1742,XXXVI.,
1743,XXXVI.,"When he kissed its fingers, her eyes grew bright."
1744,XXXVI.,"But her cheeks grew pallid when, lashing through"
1745,XXXVI.,"The woodland there, with a face a-flare"
1746,XXXVI.,"With the sting of the wind, and his gipsy hair"
1747,XXXVI.,"Flying, the falconer came, and two"
1748,XXXVI.,Or three of the people of Castle Clare.
1749,XXXVI.,And the leaves of the autumn made a frame
1750,XXXVI.,For the picture there in the morning's flame.
1751,XXXVI.,
1752,XXXVI.,"What was said in that moment, I do not know,"
1753,XXXVI.,"That moment of meeting, between those lovers;"
1754,XXXVI.,"But whatever it was, 't was whispered low,"
1755,XXXVI.,"And soft as a leaf that swings and hovers,"
1756,XXXVI.,"A twinkling gold, when the leaves are yellow."
1757,XXXVI.,"And her face with the joy was still aglow,"
1758,XXXVI.,When down through the wood that burly fellow
1759,XXXVI.,"Came with his frown, and made a pause"
1760,XXXVI.,"In the pulse of their words. My lord, Sir Hugh,"
1761,XXXVI.,Stood with the soil on his knee. No cause
1762,XXXVI.,"Had he, but his hanger he partly drew,"
1763,XXXVI.,"Then clapped it sharp in its sheath again,"
1764,XXXVI.,"And bowed to my Lady, and strode away;"
1765,XXXVI.,"And mounting his horse, with a swinging rein"
1766,XXXVI.,Rode with a song in his heart all day.
1767,XXXVI.,
1768,XXXVI.,"He loved and was loved, I knew; for, look!"
1769,XXXVI.,All other sports for the chase he forsook.
1770,XXXVI.,"And strange that he never went to hawk,"
1771,XXXVI.,"Or hunt, but Clara would meet him there"
1772,XXXVI.,"In the Strongbow forest! I know the rock,"
1773,XXXVI.,"With its fern-filled moss, by the bramble lair,"
1774,XXXVI.,"Were oft and again he met--by chance,"
1775,XXXVI.,Shall I say?--the daughter of Clare; as fair
1776,XXXVI.,"Of face as a queen in an old romance,"
1777,XXXVI.,Who waits with her sweet face pale; her hair
1778,XXXVI.,Night-deep; and eyes dove-gray with dreams;--
1779,XXXVI.,By the fountain-side where the statue gleams
1780,XXXVI.,"And the moonbeam lolls in the lily white,--"
1781,XXXVI.,For the knightly lover who comes at night.
1782,XXXVI.,
1783,XXXVI.,"Heigho! they ceased, those meetings; I wot,"
1784,XXXVI.,Betrayed to the Baron by some of his crew
1785,XXXVI.,Of menials who followed and saw and knew.
1786,XXXVI.,For she loved too well to have once forgot
1787,XXXVI.,The time and the place of their trysting true.
1788,XXXVI.,"""Why and when?"" would ask Sir Hugh"
1789,XXXVI.,In the labored letters he used to lock--
1790,XXXVI.,The lovers' post--in a coigne of that rock.
1791,XXXVI.,"She used to answer, but now did not."
1792,XXXVI.,"But nearing Yule, love got them again"
1793,XXXVI.,A twilight tryst--through frowardness sure!--
1794,XXXVI.,"They met. And that day was gray with rain,"
1795,XXXVI.,Or snow: and the wind did ever endure
1796,XXXVI.,"A long bleak moaning thorough the wood,"
1797,XXXVI.,That chapped i' the cheek and smarted the blood;
1798,XXXVI.,"And a brook in the forest went throb and throb,"
1799,XXXVI.,And over it all was the wild-beast sob
1800,XXXVI.,Of the rushing boughs like a thing pursued.
1801,XXXVI.,"And then it was that he learned how she,"
1802,XXXVI.,(God's blood! how it makes my old limbs quiver
1803,XXXVI.,To think what a miserable tyrant he--
1804,XXXVI.,The Baron Richard--aye and ever
1805,XXXVI.,To his daughter was!) forsooth! must wed
1806,XXXVI.,"With an eastern earl, a Lovell: to whom"
1807,XXXVI.,(Would God o' his mercy had struck him dead!)
1808,XXXVI.,"Clara of Clare when only a child,--"
1809,XXXVI.,"With a face like a flower, that blooms in the wild"
1810,XXXVI.,"Of the hills, and a soul like its soft perfume,--"
1811,XXXVI.,"Was given; to seal, or strengthen, some ties"
1812,XXXVI.,"Of power and wealth--say bartered, then,"
1813,XXXVI.,Like the merest chattel. With tearful eyes
1814,XXXVI.,And trembling lips she spoke; and when
1815,XXXVI.,"Her lover, the Clifford, had learned and heard,--"
1816,XXXVI.,"He'd have had her flee with him then, 'sdeath!"
1817,XXXVI.,"In spite of them all! Let her speak the word,"
1818,XXXVI.,They would fly together; the Baron's men
1819,XXXVI.,"Might follow, and if ... and he touched his sword,"
1820,XXXVI.,"It should answer! But she, while she seemed to stay,"
1821,XXXVI.,"With a hand on her bosom, her heart's quick breath,"
1822,XXXVI.,"Replied to his heat, ""They would take and slay"
1823,XXXVI.,Thee who art life of me!--No! not thus
1824,XXXVI.,Shall we fly! there's another way for us;
1825,XXXVI.,A way that is sure; an only way;
1826,XXXVI.,"I have thought it out this many a day.""--"
1827,XXXVI.,"The words that she spoke, how well I remember!"
1828,XXXVI.,"As well as the mood o' that day of December,"
1829,XXXVI.,"That bullied and blustered and seemed in league,"
1830,XXXVI.,"Like a spiteful shrew, with the wind and snow,"
1831,XXXVI.,"To drown the words of their sweet intrigue,"
1832,XXXVI.,With the boom of the boughs tossed to and fro.
1833,XXXVI.,"Her last words these, ""By curfew sure,"
1834,XXXVI.,"On Christmas eve, at the postern door."""
1835,XXXVI.,
1836,XXXVI.,And we were there; with a led horse too;
1837,XXXVI.,Armed for a journey I hardly knew
1838,XXXVI.,"Whither, but why, you well can guess."
1839,XXXVI.,"For often he whispered a certain name,"
1840,XXXVI.,"The talisman of his happiness,"
1841,XXXVI.,That warmed his blood like a yule-log's flame.
1842,XXXVI.,"While we waited there, till its owner came,"
1843,XXXVI.,"We saw how the castle's baronial girth,"
1844,XXXVI.,"Like a giant's, loosed for reveling more,"
1845,XXXVI.,Shone; and we heard the wassail and mirth
1846,XXXVI.,"Where the mistletoe hung in the hearth's red roar,"
1847,XXXVI.,And the holly brightened the weaponed wall
1848,XXXVI.,Of ancient oak in the banqueting hall.
1849,XXXVI.,"And the spits, I trow, by the scullions turned"
1850,XXXVI.,"O'er the snoring logs, rich steamed and burned,"
1851,XXXVI.,"While the whole wild-boar and the deer were roasted,"
1852,XXXVI.,And the half of an ox and the roe-buck haunches;
1853,XXXVI.,"While tuns of ale, that the cellars boasted,"
1854,XXXVI.,"And casks of sack, were broached for paunches"
1855,XXXVI.,Of vassals who reveled in stable and hall.
1856,XXXVI.,The song of the minstrel; the yeomen's quarrel
1857,XXXVI.,O'er the dice and the drink; and the huntsman's bawl
1858,XXXVI.,"In the baying kennels, its hounds a-snarl"
1859,XXXVI.,"O'er the bones of the banquet; now loud, now low,"
1860,XXXVI.,We could hear where we crouched in the drifting snow.
1861,XXXVI.,
1862,XXXVI.,Was she long? did she come?... By the postern we
1863,XXXVI.,"Like shadows waited. My lord, Sir Hugh,"
1864,XXXVI.,"Spoke, pointing a tower, ""That casement, see?"
1865,XXXVI.,When a stealthy light in its slit burns blue
1866,XXXVI.,"And signals thrice slowly, thus--'t is she."""
1867,XXXVI.,"And close to his breast his gaberdine drew,"
1868,XXXVI.,For the wind it whipped and the snow beat through.
1869,XXXVI.,"Did she come?--We had waited an hour or twain,"
1870,XXXVI.,"When the taper flashed in the central pane,"
1871,XXXVI.,And flourished three times and vanished so.
1872,XXXVI.,"And under the arch of the postern's portal,"
1873,XXXVI.,"Holding the horses, we stood in the snow,"
1874,XXXVI.,"Stiff with the cold. Ah, me! immortal"
1875,XXXVI.,"Minutes we waited, breath-bated, and listened"
1876,XXXVI.,Shivering there in the hiss of the gale:
1877,XXXVI.,"The parapets whistled, the angles glistened,"
1878,XXXVI.,And the night around seemed one black wail
1879,XXXVI.,"Of death, whose ominous presence over"
1880,XXXVI.,The stormy battlements seemed to hover.
1881,XXXVI.,"Said my lord, Sir Hugh,--to himself he spoke,--"
1882,XXXVI.,"""She feels for the spring in the sliding panel"
1883,XXXVI.,"'Neath the arras, hid in the carven oak."
1884,XXXVI.,"It opens. The stair, like a well's dark channel,"
1885,XXXVI.,Yawns; and the draught makes her taper slope.
1886,XXXVI.,"Wrapped deep in her mantle she stoops, now puts"
1887,XXXVI.,One foot on the stair; now a listening pause
1888,XXXVI.,As nearer and nearer the mad search draws
1889,XXXVI.,Of the thwarted castle. No smallest hope
1890,XXXVI.,That they find her now that the panel shuts!...
1891,XXXVI.,"If the wind, that howls like a tortured thing,"
1892,XXXVI.,"Would throttle itself with itself, then I"
1893,XXXVI.,Might hear how her hurrying footsteps ring
1894,XXXVI.,Down the hollow ... there! 't is her fingers try
1895,XXXVI.,"The postern's bolts that the rust makes cling.""--"
1896,XXXVI.,But ever some whim of the storm that shook
1897,XXXVI.,A clanging ring or a creaking hook
1898,XXXVI.,"In buttress or wall. And we waited, numb"
1899,XXXVI.,"With the cold, till dawn--but she did not come."
1900,XXXVI.,
1901,XXXVI.,"I must tell you why and have done: 'T is said,"
1902,XXXVI.,On the brink of the marriage she fled the side
1903,XXXVI.,Of the guests and the bridegroom there; she fled
1904,XXXVI.,"With a mischievous laugh,--""I'll hide! I'll hide!"
1905,XXXVI.,"Seek! and be sure that you find!""--so led"
1906,XXXVI.,A long search after her; but defied
1907,XXXVI.,All search for--a score and ten long years....
1908,XXXVI.,
1909,XXXVI.,"Well, the laughter of Yule was turned to tears"
1910,XXXVI.,For them and for us. We saw the glare
1911,XXXVI.,Of torches that hurried from chamber to stair;
1912,XXXVI.,"And we heard the castle re-echo her name,"
1913,XXXVI.,But neither to them nor to us she came.
1914,XXXVI.,And that was the last of Clara of Clare.
1915,XXXVI.,
1916,XXXVI.,"That winter it was, a month thereafter,"
1917,XXXVI.,"That the home of the Cliffords, roof and rafter,"
1918,XXXVI.,"Burned.--I could swear 't was the Strongbow's doing,"
1919,XXXVI.,Were I sure that he knew of the Clifford's wooing
1920,XXXVI.,"His daughter; and so, by the Rood and Cross!"
1921,XXXVI.,Had burned Hugh's home to avenge his loss.--
1922,XXXVI.,"So over the channel to France with his King,"
1923,XXXVI.,"The Black Prince, sailed to the wars--to deaden"
1924,XXXVI.,"The ache of the mystery--Hugh that spring,"
1925,XXXVI.,And fell at Poitiers; for his loss made leaden
1926,XXXVI.,"His heart; and his life was a weary sadness,"
1927,XXXVI.,So he flung it away in a moment's madness.
1928,XXXVI.,"And the Baron died. And the bridegroom?--well,"
1929,XXXVI.,Unlucky was he in truth!--to tell
1930,XXXVI.,"Of him there is nothing. The Baron died,"
1931,XXXVI.,The last of the Strongbows he--gramercy!
1932,XXXVI.,And the Clare estate with its wealth and pride
1933,XXXVI.,"Devolved to the Bloets, Walter and Percy."
1934,XXXVI.,
1935,XXXVI.,And years went by. And it happened that they
1936,XXXVI.,"Ransacked the old castle; and so, one day,"
1937,XXXVI.,"In a lonesome tower uprummaged a chest,"
1938,XXXVI.,"From Flanders; of ebon, and wildly carved"
1939,XXXVI.,"All over with things: a sinister crest,"
1940,XXXVI.,"And evil faces, distorted and starved;"
1941,XXXVI.,"Fast-locked with a spring, which they forced and, lo!"
1942,XXXVI.,"When they opened it--Death, like a lady dressed,"
1943,XXXVI.,"Grinned up at their terror!--but no, not so!"
1944,XXXVI.,"A skeleton, jeweled and laced, and wreathed"
1945,XXXVI.,With flowers of dust; and a miniver
1946,XXXVI.,"Around it clasped, that the ruin sheathed"
1947,XXXVI.,Of a once rich raiment of silk and fur.
1948,XXXVI.,
1949,XXXVI.,"I'd have given my life to hear him tell,"
1950,XXXVI.,"The courtly Clifford, how this befell!"
1951,XXXVI.,"He'd have known how it was: For, you see, in groping"
1952,XXXVI.,"For the secret spring of that panel, hoping"
1953,XXXVI.,And fearing as nearer and nearer drew
1954,XXXVI.,"The search of retainers, why, out she blew"
1955,XXXVI.,"The tell-tale taper; and, seeing this chest,"
1956,XXXVI.,"Would hide her a minute in it, mayhap,"
1957,XXXVI.,"Till the hurry had passed; but the death-lock, pressed"
1958,XXXVI.,"By the lid's great weight, closed fast with a snap,"
1959,XXXVI.,Ere her heart was aware of the fiendish trap.
1960,XXXVI.,
1961,XXXVI.,
1962,XXXVI.,
1963,XXXVI.,
1964,XXXVI.,The Water Witch
1965,XXXVI.,
1966,XXXVI.,
1967,XXXVI.,See! the milk-white doe is wounded.
1968,XXXVI.,He will follow as it bounds
1969,XXXVI.,Through the woods. His horn has sounded.
1970,XXXVI.,"Echoing, for his men and hounds."
1971,XXXVI.,But no answering bugle blew.
1972,XXXVI.,He has lost his retinue
1973,XXXVI.,For the shapely deer that bounded
1974,XXXVI.,Past him when his bow he drew.
1975,XXXVI.,
1976,XXXVI.,Not one hound or huntsman follows.
1977,XXXVI.,Through the underbrush and moss
1978,XXXVI.,Goes the slot; and in the hollows
1979,XXXVI.,"Of the hills, that he must cross,"
1980,XXXVI.,He has lost it. He must fare
1981,XXXVI.,Over rocks where she-wolves lair;
1982,XXXVI.,Wood-pools where the wild-boar wallows;
1983,XXXVI.,So he leaves his good steed there.
1984,XXXVI.,
1985,XXXVI.,Through his mind then flashed an olden
1986,XXXVI.,Legend told him by the monks:--
1987,XXXVI.,"Of a girl, whose hair is golden,"
1988,XXXVI.,Haunting fountains and the trunks
1989,XXXVI.,"Of the woodland; who, they say,"
1990,XXXVI.,Is a white doe all the day;
1991,XXXVI.,But when woods are night-enfolden
1992,XXXVI.,Turns into an evil fay.
1993,XXXVI.,
1994,XXXVI.,Then the story oft his teacher
1995,XXXVI.,Told him; of a mountain lake
1996,XXXVI.,"Demons dwell in; vague of feature,"
1997,XXXVI.,"Human-like, but each a snake,"
1998,XXXVI.,She is queen of.--Did he hear
1999,XXXVI.,Laughter at his startled ear?
2000,XXXVI.,"Or a bird? And now, what creature"
2001,XXXVI.,"Is it, or the wind, stirs near?"
2002,XXXVI.,
2003,XXXVI.,"Fever of the hunt. This water,"
2004,XXXVI.,"Murmuring here, will cool his head."
2005,XXXVI.,"Through the forest, fierce as slaughter,"
2006,XXXVI.,Slants the sunset; ruby red
2007,XXXVI.,Are the drops that slip between
2008,XXXVI.,"His cupped hands, while on the green,--"
2009,XXXVI.,Like the couch of some wild daughter
2010,XXXVI.,"Of the forest,--he doth lean."
2011,XXXVI.,
2012,XXXVI.,"But the runnel, bubbling, dripping,"
2013,XXXVI.,Seems to bid him to be gone;
2014,XXXVI.,"As with crystal words, and tripping"
2015,XXXVI.,Steps of sparkle luring on.
2016,XXXVI.,Now a spirit in the rocks
2017,XXXVI.,"Calls him; now a face that mocks,"
2018,XXXVI.,"From behind some bowlder slipping,"
2019,XXXVI.,Laughs at him with lilied locks.
2020,XXXVI.,
2021,XXXVI.,"So he follows through the flowers,"
2022,XXXVI.,"Blue and gold, that blossom there;"
2023,XXXVI.,Thridding twilight-haunted bowers
2024,XXXVI.,Where each ripple seems the bare
2025,XXXVI.,Beauty of white limbs that gleam
2026,XXXVI.,Rosy through the running stream;
2027,XXXVI.,"Or bright-shaken hair, that showers"
2028,XXXVI.,Starlight in the sunset's beam.
2029,XXXVI.,
2030,XXXVI.,"Till, far in the forest, sleeping"
2031,XXXVI.,"Like a luminous darkness, lay"
2032,XXXVI.,"A deep water, wherein, leaping,"
2033,XXXVI.,"Fell the Fountain of the Fay,"
2034,XXXVI.,"With a singing, sighing sound,"
2035,XXXVI.,"As of spirit things around,"
2036,XXXVI.,"Musically laughing, weeping"
2037,XXXVI.,In the air and underground.
2038,XXXVI.,
2039,XXXVI.,Not a ripple o'er it merried:
2040,XXXVI.,"Like the round moon 'neath a cloud,"
2041,XXXVI.,In its rocks the lake lay buried:
2042,XXXVI.,And strange creatures seemed to crowd
2043,XXXVI.,Its dark depths; vague limbs and eyes
2044,XXXVI.,To the surface seemed to rise
2045,XXXVI.,"Spawn-like and, as formless, ferried"
2046,XXXVI.,"Through the water, shadow-wise."
2047,XXXVI.,
2048,XXXVI.,"Foliage things with human faces,"
2049,XXXVI.,"Demon-dreadful, pale and wild"
2050,XXXVI.,As the forms the lightning traces
2051,XXXVI.,"On the clouds the storm has piled,"
2052,XXXVI.,"Seeming now to draw to land,"
2053,XXXVI.,Now away--Then up the strand
2054,XXXVI.,Comes a woman; and she places
2055,XXXVI.,On his arm a spray-white hand.
2056,XXXVI.,
2057,XXXVI.,Ah! an untold world of sorrow
2058,XXXVI.,"Were her eyes; her hair, a place"
2059,XXXVI.,Whence the moon its gold might borrow;
2060,XXXVI.,And a dream of ice her face:
2061,XXXVI.,'Round her hair and throat in rims
2062,XXXVI.,Pearls of foam hung; and through whims
2063,XXXVI.,"Of her robe, as breaks the morrow,"
2064,XXXVI.,Shone the rose-light of her limbs.
2065,XXXVI.,
2066,XXXVI.,Who could help but look with gladness
2067,XXXVI.,"On such beauty? though within,"
2068,XXXVI.,Deep within the beryl sadness
2069,XXXVI.,"Of those eyes, the serpent sin"
2070,XXXVI.,Coil?--When she hath placed her cheek
2071,XXXVI.,"Chilly upon his, and weak,"
2072,XXXVI.,"With love longing and its madness,"
2073,XXXVI.,"Is his will grown, then she'll speak:"
2074,XXXVI.,
2075,XXXVI.,"""Dost thou love me?""--""If surrender"
2076,XXXVI.,"Is to love thee, then I love.""--"
2077,XXXVI.,"""Hast no fear then?""--""In the splendor"
2078,XXXVI.,Of thy gaze who knows thereof?
2079,XXXVI.,Yet I fear--I fear to lose
2080,XXXVI.,"Thee, thy love!""--""And thou dost choose"
2081,XXXVI.,"Aye to be my heart's defender?""--"
2082,XXXVI.,"""Take me. I am thine to use."""
2083,XXXVI.,
2084,XXXVI.,"""Follow then. Ah, love, no lowly"
2085,XXXVI.,"Home I give thee.""--With fixed eyes,"
2086,XXXVI.,To the water's edge she slowly
2087,XXXVI.,Drew him.... And he did surmise
2088,XXXVI.,"'Twas her lips on his, until"
2089,XXXVI.,"O'er his face the foam closed chill,"
2090,XXXVI.,"Whisp'ring, and the lake unholy"
2091,XXXVI.,"Rippled, rippled and was still."
2092,XXXVI.,
2093,XXXVI.,
2094,XXXVI.,
2095,XXXVI.,
2096,XXXVI.,At Nineveh
2097,XXXVI.,
2098,XXXVI.,Written for my friend Walter S. Mathews.
2099,XXXVI.,
2100,XXXVI.,
2101,XXXVI.,"There was a princess once, who loved the slave"
2102,XXXVI.,"Of an Assyrian king, her father; known"
2103,XXXVI.,At Nineveh as Hadria; o'er whose grave
2104,XXXVI.,The sands of centuries have long been blown;
2105,XXXVI.,Yet sooner shall the night forget its stars
2106,XXXVI.,"Than love her story:--How, unto his throne,"
2107,XXXVI.,"One day she came, where, with his warriors,"
2108,XXXVI.,"The king sat in the hall of audience,"
2109,XXXVI.,"'Mid pillared trophies of barbaric wars,"
2110,XXXVI.,"And, kneeling to him, asked, ""O father, whence"
2111,XXXVI.,"Comes love and why?""--He, smiling on her, said,--"
2112,XXXVI.,"""O Hadria, love is of the gods, and hence"
2113,XXXVI.,"Divine, is only soul-interpreted."
2114,XXXVI.,"But why love is, ah, child, we do not know,"
2115,XXXVI.,"Unless 'tis love that gives us life when dead.""--"
2116,XXXVI.,"And then his daughter, with a face aglow"
2117,XXXVI.,With all the love that clamored in her blood
2118,XXXVI.,"Its sweet avowal, lifted arms of snow,"
2119,XXXVI.,"And, like Aurora's rose, before him stood,"
2120,XXXVI.,"Saying,--""Since love is of the powers above,"
2121,XXXVI.,"I love a slave, O Asshur! Let the good"
2122,XXXVI.,The gods have giv'n be sanctioned. Speak not of
2123,XXXVI.,Dishonor and our line's ancestral dead!
2124,XXXVI.,"They are imperial dust. I live and love.""--"
2125,XXXVI.,"Black as black storm then rose the king and said,--"
2126,XXXVI.,"A lightning gesture at her standing there,--"
2127,XXXVI.,"""Enough! ho, Rhana, strike me off her head!"""
2128,XXXVI.,"And at the mandate, with his limbs half bare"
2129,XXXVI.,A slave strode forth. Majestic was his form
2130,XXXVI.,"As some young god's. He, gathering up her hair,"
2131,XXXVI.,Wound it three times around his sinewy arm.
2132,XXXVI.,Then drew his sword. It for one moment shone
2133,XXXVI.,"A semicircling light, and, dripping warm,"
2134,XXXVI.,Lifting the head he stood before the throne.
2135,XXXVI.,"Then cried the despot, ""By the horn of Bel!"
2136,XXXVI.,"This was no child of mine!""--Like chiselled stone"
2137,XXXVI.,"Still stood the slave, a son of Israel."
2138,XXXVI.,"Then striding towards the monarch, in his eye"
2139,XXXVI.,"The wrath of heaven and the hate of hell,"
2140,XXXVI.,"Shrieked, ""Lust! I loved her! look on us and die!"""
2141,XXXVI.,Swifter than fire clove him to the brain.
2142,XXXVI.,"Then kissed the dead fair face of her held high,"
2143,XXXVI.,"And crying, ""Judge, O God, between us twain!"""
2144,XXXVI.,"A thousand daggers in his heart, fell slain."
2145,XXXVI.,

2148,XXXVI.,
2149,XXXVI.,How They Brought Aid to Bryan's Station
2150,XXXVI.,
2151,XXXVI.,"During the siege of Bryan's Station, Kentucky, August 16, 1782, Nicholas"
2152,XXXVI.,"Tomlinson and Thomas Bell, two inhabitants of the Fort, undertook to"
2153,XXXVI.,"ride through the besieging Indian and Tory lines to Lexington, Ky., for"
2154,XXXVI.,aid. It happened also during this siege that the pioneer women of the
2155,XXXVI.,"Fort, when the water supply was exhausted, heroically carried water from"
2156,XXXVI.,"a spring, at a considerable distance outside the palisades of the"
2157,XXXVI.,"Station, to its inmates, under the very guns of the enemy."
2158,XXXVI.,
2159,XXXVI.,
2160,XXXVI.,"With saddles girt and reins held fast,"
2161,XXXVI.,"Our rifles well in front, at last"
2162,XXXVI.,Tom Bell and I were mounted.
2163,XXXVI.,"The gate swung wide. We said, ""Good-bye."""
2164,XXXVI.,No time for talk had Bell and I.
2165,XXXVI.,"One said, ""God speed!"" another, ""Fly!"""
2166,XXXVI.,"Then out we galloped. Live or die,"
2167,XXXVI.,We felt each moment counted.
2168,XXXVI.,
2169,XXXVI.,"The trace, the buffaloes had worn,"
2170,XXXVI.,Stretched broad before us; and the corn
2171,XXXVI.,"And cane through which it wended,"
2172,XXXVI.,We knew for acres from the gate
2173,XXXVI.,Hid Indian guile and Tory hate.
2174,XXXVI.,We rode with hearts that seemed to wait
2175,XXXVI.,For instant death; and on our fate
2176,XXXVI.,The Station's fate depended.
2177,XXXVI.,
2178,XXXVI.,"No rifle cracked. No creature stirred,"
2179,XXXVI.,As on towards Lexington we spurred
2180,XXXVI.,Unflinchingly together.
2181,XXXVI.,We reached the woods: no savage shout
2182,XXXVI.,Of all the wild Wyandotte rout
2183,XXXVI.,And Shawanese had yet rung out:
2184,XXXVI.,But now and then an Indian scout
2185,XXXVI.,Showed here a face and feather.
2186,XXXVI.,
2187,XXXVI.,We rode expecting death each stride
2188,XXXVI.,"From thicket depth or tree-trunk side,"
2189,XXXVI.,Where some red foe might huddle--
2190,XXXVI.,"For well we knew that renegade,"
2191,XXXVI.,"The blood-stained Girty, had not stayed"
2192,XXXVI.,"His fiends from us, who rode for aid,--"
2193,XXXVI.,The dastard he who had betrayed
2194,XXXVI.,The pioneers of Ruddle.
2195,XXXVI.,
2196,XXXVI.,And when an arrow grazed my hair
2197,XXXVI.,"I did not turn, I did not spare"
2198,XXXVI.,To spur as men spur warward:
2199,XXXVI.,A war-whoop rang this side a rock:
2200,XXXVI.,"Then painted faces swarmed, to block"
2201,XXXVI.,"Our way, with brandished tomahawk"
2202,XXXVI.,"And rifle: then a shout, a shock--"
2203,XXXVI.,And we again rode forward.
2204,XXXVI.,
2205,XXXVI.,They followed; but 'twas no great while
2206,XXXVI.,Before from them by some long mile
2207,XXXVI.,Of forest we were sundered.
2208,XXXVI.,We galloped on. I'd lost my gun;
2209,XXXVI.,"And Bell, whose girth had come undone,"
2210,XXXVI.,Rode saddleless. The summer sun
2211,XXXVI.,Was up when into Lexington
2212,XXXVI.,Side unto side we thundered.
2213,XXXVI.,
2214,XXXVI.,Too late. For Todd had left that day
2215,XXXVI.,With many men. Decoyed away
2216,XXXVI.,To Hoy's by some false story.
2217,XXXVI.,And we must after. Bryan's needs
2218,XXXVI.,"Said, ""On!"" although our gallant steeds"
2219,XXXVI.,Were blown--Enough! we must do deeds!
2220,XXXVI.,"Must follow where our duty leads,"
2221,XXXVI.,Be it to death or glory.
2222,XXXVI.,
2223,XXXVI.,The way was wild and often barred
2224,XXXVI.,By trees and rocks; and it was hard
2225,XXXVI.,To keep our hearts from sinking;
2226,XXXVI.,But thoughts of those we'd left behind
2227,XXXVI.,Gave strength to muscle and to mind
2228,XXXVI.,To help us onward through the blind
2229,XXXVI.,Deep woods. And often we would find
2230,XXXVI.,Ourselves of loved ones thinking.
2231,XXXVI.,
2232,XXXVI.,The hot stockade. No water left.
2233,XXXVI.,The fierce attack. All hope bereft
2234,XXXVI.,The powder-grimed defender.
2235,XXXVI.,The war-cry and the groan of pain.
2236,XXXVI.,All day the slanting arrow-rain
2237,XXXVI.,Of fire from the corn and cane.
2238,XXXVI.,"The stern defence, but all in vain."
2239,XXXVI.,And then at last--surrender.
2240,XXXVI.,
2241,XXXVI.,But not for Bryan's!--no! too well
2242,XXXVI.,Must they remember what befell
2243,XXXVI.,At Ruddle's and take warning.
2244,XXXVI.,"So thought we as, all dust and sweat,"
2245,XXXVI.,"We rode with faces forward set,"
2246,XXXVI.,And came to Station Boone while yet
2247,XXXVI.,An hour from noon ... We had not let
2248,XXXVI.,Our horses rest since morning.
2249,XXXVI.,
2250,XXXVI.,Here Ellis met us with his men.
2251,XXXVI.,They did not stop nor tarry then.
2252,XXXVI.,That little band of lions;
2253,XXXVI.,"But setting out at once with aid,"
2254,XXXVI.,Right well you know how unafraid
2255,XXXVI.,"They charged the Indian ambuscade,"
2256,XXXVI.,And through a storm of bullets made
2257,XXXVI.,Their entrance into Bryan's.
2258,XXXVI.,
2259,XXXVI.,And that is all I have to tell.
2260,XXXVI.,No more the Huron's hideous yell
2261,XXXVI.,Sounds to assault and slaughter.--
2262,XXXVI.,Perhaps to us some praise is due;
2263,XXXVI.,"But we are men, accustomed to"
2264,XXXVI.,"Such dangers, which we often woo."
2265,XXXVI.,Much more is due our women who
2266,XXXVI.,Brought to the Station--water.
2267,XXXVI.,
2268,XXXVI.,
2269,XXXVI.,
2270,XXXVI.,
2271,XXXVI.,On the Jellico Spur of the Cumberlands
2272,XXXVI.,

2274,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2275,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2276,"TO J. FOX, JR.","You remember how the mist,"
2277,"TO J. FOX, JR.","When we climbed to Devil's Den,"
2278,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Pearly in the mountain glen,"
2279,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And above us, amethyst,"
2280,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Throbbed or circled? then away,"
2281,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Through the wildwoods opposite,"
2282,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Torn and scattered, morning-lit,"
2283,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Vanished into dewy gray?--
2284,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Vague as in romance we saw,"
2285,"TO J. FOX, JR.","From the fog, one riven trunk,"
2286,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Talon-like with branches shrunk,"
2287,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Thrust a monster dragon claw.
2288,"TO J. FOX, JR.",And we climbed for hours through
2289,"TO J. FOX, JR.","The dawn-dripping Jellicoes,"
2290,"TO J. FOX, JR.",To a wooded rock that shows
2291,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Undulating leagues of blue
2292,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Summits; mountain-chains that lie
2293,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Dark with forests; bar on bar,"
2294,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Ranging their irregular
2295,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Purple peaks beneath a sky
2296,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Soft as slumber. Range on range
2297,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Billow their enormous spines,"
2298,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Where the rocks and priestly pines
2299,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Sit eternal, without change."
2300,"TO J. FOX, JR.",We were sons of Nature then:
2301,"TO J. FOX, JR.","She had taken us to her,"
2302,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Signalized by brier and burr,"
2303,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Something more to her than men:
2304,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Pupils of her lofty moods,"
2305,"TO J. FOX, JR.","From her bloom-anointed looks,"
2306,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Wisdom of no man-made books
2307,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Learned we in those solitudes:
2308,"TO J. FOX, JR.",How the seed supplied the flower;
2309,"TO J. FOX, JR.",How the sapling held the oak;
2310,"TO J. FOX, JR.",How within the vine awoke
2311,"TO J. FOX, JR.",The wild impulse still to tower;
2312,"TO J. FOX, JR.","How in fantasy or mirth,"
2313,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Springing from her footsteps there,"
2314,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Curious fungi everywhere
2315,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Bulged, exuded from the earth;"
2316,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Coral vegetable things,"
2317,"TO J. FOX, JR.","That the underworld exhaled,"
2318,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Bulbous, crystal-ribbed and scaled,"
2319,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Many colored and in rings,"
2320,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Like the Indian-Pipe that grew
2321,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Pink and white in loamy cracks,"
2322,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Flowers of a natural wax,"
2323,"TO J. FOX, JR.",She had turned her fancy to.--
2324,"TO J. FOX, JR.","On that laureled precipice,"
2325,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Where the chestnuts dropped their burrs,"
2326,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Sweet with balsam of the firs,"
2327,"TO J. FOX, JR.",First we felt her mother kiss
2328,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Full of heaven and the wind;
2329,"TO J. FOX, JR.","While the forests, wood on wood,"
2330,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Murmured like a multitude
2331,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Giving praise where none hath sinned.--
2332,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Freedom met us there; we saw
2333,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Freedom giving audience;
2334,"TO J. FOX, JR.","In her face the eloquence,"
2335,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Lightning-like, of love and law:"
2336,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Round her, with majestic hips,"
2337,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Lay the giant mountains; there
2338,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Near her, cataracts tossed their hair,"
2339,"TO J. FOX, JR.",God and thunder on their lips.--
2340,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Oft an eagle, or a hawk,"
2341,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Or a scavenger, we knew"
2342,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Winged through altitudes of blue,"
2343,"TO J. FOX, JR.",By its shadow on the rock.
2344,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Or a cloud of templed white
2345,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Moved, a lazy berg of pearl,"
2346,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Through the sky's pacific swirl,"
2347,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Shot with cool cerulean light.
2348,"TO J. FOX, JR.",So we dreamed an hour upon
2349,"TO J. FOX, JR.","That warm rock the lichens mossed,"
2350,"TO J. FOX, JR.",While around us foliage tossed
2351,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Coins, gold-minted of the sun:"
2352,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Then arose; and a ravine,"
2353,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Which a torrent once had worn,"
2354,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Made our roadway to the corn,"
2355,"TO J. FOX, JR.","In the valley, deep and green;"
2356,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And the farm house with its bees,"
2357,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Where old-fashioned flowers spun
2358,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Gay rag-carpets in the sun,"
2359,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Hid among the apple trees.
2360,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Here we watched the twilight fall;
2361,"TO J. FOX, JR.",O'er Wolf-Mountain sunset made
2362,"TO J. FOX, JR.",A huge rhododendron rayed
2363,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Round the sun's cloud-centered ball.
2364,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Then through scents of herb and soil,"
2365,"TO J. FOX, JR.","To the mining-camp we turned,"
2366,"TO J. FOX, JR.",In the twinkling dusk discerned
2367,"TO J. FOX, JR.",With its white-washed homes of toil.
2368,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Ah, those nights!--We wandered forth"
2369,"TO J. FOX, JR.","On some haunted mountain path,"
2370,"TO J. FOX, JR.","When the moon was late, and rathe"
2371,"TO J. FOX, JR.","The large stars, sowed south and north,"
2372,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Splashed with gold the purple skies;
2373,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And the milky zodiac,"
2374,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Rolled athwart the belted black,"
2375,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Seemed a path to Paradise.
2376,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And we walked or lingered till,"
2377,"TO J. FOX, JR.","In the valley-land beneath,"
2378,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Like the vapor of a breath
2379,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Breathed in frost, arose the still"
2380,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Architecture of the mist:
2381,"TO J. FOX, JR.",And the moon-dawn's necromance
2382,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Touched the mist and made it glance
2383,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Like a town of amethyst.
2384,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Then around us, sharp and brusque,"
2385,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Night's shrill insects strident strung
2386,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Instruments that buzzed and sung
2387,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Pixy music of the dusk.
2388,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And we seemed to hear soft sighs,"
2389,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And hushed steps of ghostly things,"
2390,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Fluttered feet or rustled wings,"
2391,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Moved before us. Fire-flies,"
2392,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Gleaming in the tangled glade,"
2393,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Seemed the eyes of warriors
2394,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Stealing under watching stars
2395,"TO J. FOX, JR.",To some midnight ambuscade;
2396,"TO J. FOX, JR.","To the Indian village there,"
2397,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Wigwamed with the mist, that slept"
2398,"TO J. FOX, JR.","By the woodland side, whence crept"
2399,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Shadowy Shawnees of the air.
2400,"TO J. FOX, JR.","When the moon rose, like a cup"
2401,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Lay the valley, brimmed with wine"
2402,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Of mesmeric shade and shine,"
2403,"TO J. FOX, JR.",To the moon's pale face held up.
2404,"TO J. FOX, JR.",As she rose from out the mines
2405,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Of the eastern darkness, night"
2406,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Met her, clad in dewy light"
2407,"TO J. FOX, JR.",'Mid Pine Mountain's sachem pines.
2408,"TO J. FOX, JR.",As from clouds in pearly parts
2409,"TO J. FOX, JR.","Her serene circumference grew,"
2410,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Home we turned. And all night through
2411,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Dreamed the dreams of happy hearts.
2412,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2413,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2414,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2415,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2416,"TO J. FOX, JR.",A Confession
2417,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2418,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2419,"TO J. FOX, JR.",These are the facts:--I was to blame:
2420,"TO J. FOX, JR.",I brought her here and wrought her shame:
2421,"TO J. FOX, JR.",She came with me all trustingly.
2422,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Lovely and innocent her face:
2423,"TO J. FOX, JR.","And in her perfect form, the grace"
2424,"TO J. FOX, JR.",Of purity and modesty.
2425,"TO J. FOX, JR.",
2426,"TO J. FOX, JR.",I think I loved her then: 'would dote
2427,"TO J. FOX, JR.","On her ambrosial breast and throat,"
