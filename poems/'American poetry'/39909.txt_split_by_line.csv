364,NEVERSINK[1],"In vast retirements herd the deer,"

370,NEVERSINK[1],"Proud heights! with pain so often seen,"

381,NEVERSINK[1],[1] The first trace I can find of this poem is in the _Freeman's
382,NEVERSINK[1],"Journal_, February 2, 1791, where it is entitled ""Stanzas written on the"
383,NEVERSINK[1],"Hills of Neversink near Sandy Hook, 1790."" In the republication of the"
384,NEVERSINK[1],"poem in the _National Gazette_, November 28, 1791, the month ""July"" was"
385,NEVERSINK[1],added to the title. It was the poet's valedictory to the ocean after his
386,NEVERSINK[1],"wanderings. He was married in May, 1790, and he now evidently looked"
387,NEVERSINK[1],forward to a settled career. The poem has been placed slightly out of
388,NEVERSINK[1],order as will be seen. It was republished only in the 1795 edition which
389,NEVERSINK[1],the text follows. The first five lines of the original version were as
390,NEVERSINK[1],follows:
391,NEVERSINK[1],
392,NEVERSINK[1],"""In early days and vanished years"
393,NEVERSINK[1],"To rougher toils resigned,"
394,NEVERSINK[1],You saw me rove in search of care
395,NEVERSINK[1],And leave true bliss behind;
396,NEVERSINK[1],"You saw me rig the barque so trim,"" etc."

1368,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],
1369,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],
1370,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],On a fine Sunday morning I mounted my steed
1371,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],And southward from Hartford had meant to proceed;
1372,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"My baggage was stow'd in a cart very snug,"
1373,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Which Ranger, the gelding, was destined to lug;"
1374,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"With his harness and buckles, he loom'd very grand,"
1375,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"And was drove by young Darby, a lad of the land--"
1376,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"On land, or on water, most handy was he,"
1377,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"A jockey on shore, and a sailor at sea,"
1378,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"He knew all the roads, he was so very keen"
1379,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"And the Bible by heart, at the age of fifteen."
1380,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"As thus I jogg'd on, to my saddle confined,"
1381,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],With Ranger and Darby a distance behind;
1382,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],At last in full view of a steeple we came
1383,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],With a cock on the spire (I suppose he was game;
1384,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"A dove in the pulpit may suit your grave people,"
1385,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],But always remember--a cock on the steeple)
1386,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Cries Darby--""Dear master, I beg you to stay;"
1387,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Believe me, there's danger in driving this way;"
1388,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Our deacons on Sundays have power to arrest
1389,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],And lead us to church--if your honour thinks best--
1390,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Though still I must do them the justice to tell,"
1391,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"They would choose you should pay them the fine--full as well."""
1392,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"The fine (said I) Darby, how much may it be--"
1393,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"A shilling or sixpence?--why, now let me see,"
1394,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Three shillings are all the small pence that remain,"
1395,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],And to change a half joe would be rather profane.
1396,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Is it more than three shillings, the fine that you speak on;"
1397,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],What say you good Darby--will that serve the deacon.
1398,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"""Three shillings (cried Darby) why, master, you're jesting!--"
1399,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Let us luff while we can and make sure of our westing--
1400,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Forty shillings, excuse me, is too much to pay"
1401,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],It would take my month's wages--that's all I've to say.
1402,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],By taking this road that inclines to the right
1403,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"The squire and the sexton may bid us good night,"
1404,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],If once to old Ranger I give up the rein
1405,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"The parson himself may pursue us in vain."""
1406,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"""Not I, my good Darby (I answer'd the lad)"
1407,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Leave the church on the left! they would think we were mad;
1408,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"I would sooner rely on the heels of my steed,"
1409,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],And pass by them all like a Jehu indeed:--
1410,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],As long as I'm able to lead in the race
1411,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Old Ranger, the gelding, will go a good pace,"
1412,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"As the deacon pursues, he will fly like a swallow,"
1413,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"And you in the cart must, undoubtedly, follow."""
1414,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Then approaching the church, as we pass'd by the door"
1415,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"The sexton peep'd out, with a saint or two more,"
1416,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"A deacon came forward and waved us his hat,"
1417,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],A signal to drop him some money--mind that!--
1418,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"""Now, Darby (I halloo'd) be ready to skip,"
1419,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Ease off the curb bridle--give Ranger the whip:
1420,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"While you have the rear, and myself lead the way,"
1421,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"No doctor or deacon shall catch us this day."""
1422,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],By this time the deacon had mounted his poney
1423,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],And chaced for the sake of our souls and--our money:
1424,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"The saint, as he followed, cried--""Stop them, halloo!"""
1425,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"As swift as he followed, as swiftly we flew--"
1426,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"""Ah master! (said Darby) I very much fear"
1427,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"We must drop him some money to check his career,"
1428,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],He is gaining upon us and waves with his hat
1429,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"There's nothing, dear master, will stop him but that."
1430,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Remember the Beaver (you well know the fable)
1431,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Who flying the hunters as long as he's able,"
1432,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],When he finds that his efforts can nothing avail
1433,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"But death and the puppies are close at his tail,"
1434,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Instead of desponding at such a dead lift
1435,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"He bites off their object, and makes a free gift--"
1436,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Since fortune all hope of escaping denies
1437,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Better give them a little, than lose the whole prize."""
1438,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"But scarce had he spoke, when we came to a place"
1439,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],"Whose muddy condition concluded the chace,"
1440,THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATH-DAY CHACE[28],Down settled the cart--and old Ranger stuck fast

3053,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"Let some in beer place their delight,"
3054,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"O'er bottled porter waste the night,"

3077,THE DISH OF TEA[53],This magic bowl revives the soul;
3078,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"With gentlest sway, bids care be gay;"
3079,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"Nor mounts, to cloud the brain."
3080,THE DISH OF TEA[53],
3081,THE DISH OF TEA[53],If learned men the truth would speak
3082,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"They prize it far beyond their Greek,"
3083,THE DISH OF TEA[53],More fond attention pay;
3084,THE DISH OF TEA[53],No Hebrew root so well can suit;
3085,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"More quickly taught, less dearly bought,"
3086,THE DISH OF TEA[53],Yet studied twice a day.
3087,THE DISH OF TEA[53],
3088,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"This leaf, from distant regions sprung,"
3089,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"Puts life into the female tongue,"
3090,THE DISH OF TEA[53],And aids the cause of love.
3091,THE DISH OF TEA[53],Such power has Tea o'er bond and free;
3092,THE DISH OF TEA[53],"Which priests admire, delights the 'squire,"
3093,THE DISH OF TEA[53],And Galen's sons approve.

3182,A BACK-WOODSMAN[56],"Where lords and knights, as thick as rushes grow,"
3183,A BACK-WOODSMAN[56],And vulgar folks are in each other's way;

3190,A BACK-WOODSMAN[56],How few aspire to quit the ungrateful soil
3191,A BACK-WOODSMAN[56],That starves the plant it had the strength to bear:

5627,MR. JAY'S TREATY[97],"Jay's treaty with England was laid before the Senate in June, 1795, and"
5628,MR. JAY'S TREATY[97],after two weeks of fierce discussion was ratified by a very small
5629,MR. JAY'S TREATY[97],"majority. The Senate, fearing popular criticism, forbade the publication"
5630,MR. JAY'S TREATY[97],"of the treaty, a course which caused such widespread indignation that"
5631,MR. JAY'S TREATY[97],Mason on his own responsibility gave a perfect copy of the text to the

5644,PARODY[98],"Americans! behold the fruits,"
5645,PARODY[98],"The end of all your vain pursuits,"
5646,PARODY[98],Whole years in blood and warfare spent
5647,PARODY[98],To save this injur'd continent.--
5648,PARODY[98],How must it mortify your pride
5649,PARODY[98],To take once more the British side;
5650,PARODY[98],How will your eyes contain their tears
5651,PARODY[98],When all the sad effect appears!
5652,PARODY[98],
5653,PARODY[98],This Treaty in one page confines
5654,PARODY[98],The sad result of base designs;
5655,PARODY[98],The wretched purchase here behold
5656,PARODY[98],Of traitors--who their country sold.
5657,PARODY[98],"Here, in their proper shape and mien"
5658,PARODY[98],"Fraud, perjury, and guilt are seen."

5662,PARODY[98],"Go home, ye merchants, poor and lean,"
5663,PARODY[98],And kiss the--_hand_--of Britain's queen.
5664,PARODY[98],I see you of your cargoes stript
5665,PARODY[98],"Your vessels stolen, your seamen whipt,"
5666,PARODY[98],I see them from their decks compell'd
5667,PARODY[98],To wander o'er the wat'ry field;--
5668,PARODY[98],"In British ships, by force detain'd"
5669,PARODY[98],I see the gallant sailor band
5670,PARODY[98],Engage the power that lent us aid
5671,PARODY[98],When Britain here her entry made--
5672,PARODY[98],"I see them mix'd with George's sons,"
5673,PARODY[98],"I see them torn by gallic guns,"
5674,PARODY[98],"Disfigur'd, in the ocean cast"
5675,PARODY[98],To find a resting place at last.
5676,PARODY[98],
5677,PARODY[98],"Philosophy! thou friend of man,"
5678,PARODY[98],Teach me these strange events to scan;
5679,PARODY[98],Aid me to learn the secret cause
5680,PARODY[98],"That alien seems from Nature's laws,"
5681,PARODY[98],Why on this stage of human things
5682,PARODY[98],Man bows his neck to tyrant kings?
5683,PARODY[98],"Say did the God, when life he gave,"
5684,PARODY[98],Design his Image for a slave?--
5685,PARODY[98],"Necessity, the tyrant's law,"
5686,PARODY[98],"All human race doth this way draw,"
5687,PARODY[98],All prompted by the same desire
5688,PARODY[98],"The vigorous youth, and aged sire--"
5689,PARODY[98],"Observe, the coward and the bold"
5690,PARODY[98],Agree to have their freedom sold;
5691,PARODY[98],"Physician, lawyer, and divine"
5692,PARODY[98],All make oblation at this shrine.
5693,PARODY[98],
5694,PARODY[98],Yet from this dismal state of things
5695,PARODY[98],In time a new creation springs;
5696,PARODY[98],"From vile materials, fresh, shall rise"
5697,PARODY[98],"And fill the earth, and air, and skies;"
5698,PARODY[98],"In various forms appear again,"
5699,PARODY[98],"Popes, Presidents, and gentlemen:"
5700,PARODY[98],"So Jove pronounc'd among the Gods,"

7954,THE INDIAN CONVERT[149],
7955,THE INDIAN CONVERT[149],You fool (said the preacher) no liquors are there!
7956,THE INDIAN CONVERT[149],"The place I'm describing is most like our meeting,"

8617,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]",America was full of rumors of a French invasion. Talleyrand was
8618,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]",scattering obscure hints that an invading army was preparing; that
8619,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]",France well knew that America was divided; that only the Federalists
8620,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]","would support the administration. The Federalists, supported by"
8621,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]","President Adams and by Washington, took active measures at once. In July"
8622,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]",they formally abrogated the treaty between the two countries and
8623,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]",authorized the President to grant letters to shipmen empowering them to
8624,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]","seize French vessels. The army was put into readiness, and financial"
8625,"ON THE WAR PATRONS, 1798[156]",legislation was enacted to procure means for carrying on the war. All

9543,STANZAS[169],"The chief, the patriot, and the sage"
9544,STANZAS[169],To Vernon bids his last adieu:
9545,STANZAS[169],To reap in some exalted sphere
9546,STANZAS[169],The just rewards of virtue here.
9547,STANZAS[169],
9548,STANZAS[169],"Thou, Washington, by heaven design'd"
9549,STANZAS[169],To act a part in human things
9550,STANZAS[169],"That few have known among mankind,"
9551,STANZAS[169],And far beyond the task of kings;
9552,STANZAS[169],"We hail you now to heaven received,"
9553,STANZAS[169],Your mighty task on earth achieved.
9554,STANZAS[169],

10721,GENERAL NOTE.,"From the best accounts that could be procured at Madeira, there perished"
10722,GENERAL NOTE.,"in and near the city of Funchal, five hundred and fifty persons. The"
10723,GENERAL NOTE.,ravages were chiefly confined to the eastern parts of the town where the
10724,GENERAL NOTE.,"loss was immense in bridges, houses, streets and other property, public"
10725,GENERAL NOTE.,"as well as private--there was one magnificent church totally destroyed,"
10726,GENERAL NOTE.,"standing near the sea, and called in the portuguese tongue, Nossa"
10727,GENERAL NOTE.,"Senyora da Caillou (lady of the beach) besides this, there were five"
10728,GENERAL NOTE.,handsome chapels carried away. Five very considerable streets with their
10729,GENERAL NOTE.,"immense stone buildings have entirely disappeared, or but some"
10730,GENERAL NOTE.,insignificant parts remaining. The water rose in a short space of time
10731,GENERAL NOTE.,"from 14 to 16 feet in the adjacent parts of the city, and bursting into"
10732,GENERAL NOTE.,"the buildings, where it did not much injure the latter, it greatly"
10733,GENERAL NOTE.,damaged the merchantile property lodged therein. There were about two
10734,GENERAL NOTE.,"hundred persons supposed to be lost in other parts of the island,"
10735,GENERAL NOTE.,"particularly in the villages, and small towns. The following"
10736,GENERAL NOTE.,"circumstance it was asserted, added not a little to the devastations"
10737,GENERAL NOTE.,"occasioned by the accumulation of water in the vallies. The governor,"
10738,GENERAL NOTE.,"with several other considerable landholders in the mountains, had, for"
10739,GENERAL NOTE.,"several years back, been in the practice of erecting stone dams across"
10740,GENERAL NOTE.,"the vast and spacious valley above the city, at different intervals of"
10741,GENERAL NOTE.,"distance for the purpose of watering the adjacent grounds, or leading"
10742,GENERAL NOTE.,off streams in a variety of directions--when the immense body of rain
10743,GENERAL NOTE.,"fell in October last, all this gave way, and carried death and"

12513,MILITARY RECRUITING,When first I arrived to the age of a man
12514,MILITARY RECRUITING,"And met the distraction of care,"
12515,MILITARY RECRUITING,As the day to a close rather sorrowful ran
12516,MILITARY RECRUITING,Yet I smiled and I smoked my segar:

12518,MILITARY RECRUITING,"What a feast, what a dream"
12519,MILITARY RECRUITING,What a pleasure to smoke the segar!

12521,MILITARY RECRUITING,In vain did the din of the females assail
12522,MILITARY RECRUITING,"Or the noise of the carts in the street,"
12523,MILITARY RECRUITING,With a spanish segar and a pint of good ale
12524,MILITARY RECRUITING,I found my enjoyment complete:
12525,MILITARY RECRUITING,Old care I dismiss'd
12526,MILITARY RECRUITING,While I held in my fist
12527,MILITARY RECRUITING,"The pitcher, and smoked the segar."
12528,MILITARY RECRUITING,
12529,MILITARY RECRUITING,"What a world are we in, if we do not retire,"

12532,MILITARY RECRUITING,"With a sixpence or shilling to spare,"

12536,MILITARY RECRUITING,

12540,MILITARY RECRUITING,What are they without the segar?
12541,MILITARY RECRUITING,"What they say may be right,"
12542,MILITARY RECRUITING,But they give no delight
12543,MILITARY RECRUITING,Unless they have smoked the segar.

12545,MILITARY RECRUITING,"The farmer still plodding, who follows his plough,"

12557,MILITARY RECRUITING,To keep them in trim

12564,MILITARY RECRUITING,Would they let him but smoke his segar:
12565,MILITARY RECRUITING,Every gun in the fort
12566,MILITARY RECRUITING,Should make its report
12567,MILITARY RECRUITING,From the fire which illumes the segar.

12821,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,And all to yield to Britain's law.
12822,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12823,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,And thus he made a sad mistake;
12824,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Forsooth he must possess the lake,"
12825,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,As merely made for England's sake
12826,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,To play her pranks and rule the roast;
12827,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Where she might govern, uncontrol'd,"
12828,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"An unmolested empire hold,"
12829,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And keep a fleet to fish up gold,"
12830,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,To pay the troops of George Provost.
12831,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12832,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"The ships approach'd, of either side,"
12833,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And Erie, on his bosom wide"
12834,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Beheld two hostile navies ride,"
12835,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,Each for the combat well prepared:
12836,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"The lake was smooth, the sky was clear,"
12837,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"The martial drum had banish'd fear,"
12838,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And death and danger hover'd near,"
12839,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,Though both were held in disregard.
12840,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12841,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"From lofty heights their colors flew,"
12842,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And Britain's standard all in view,"
12843,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,With frantic valor fired the crew
12844,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,That mann'd the guns of queen Charlotte.
12845,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"""And we must Perry's squadron take,"
12846,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,And England shall command the lake;--
12847,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And you must fight for Britain's sake,"
12848,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"(Said Barclay) sailors, will you not?"""
12849,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12850,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,Assent they gave with heart and hand;
12851,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,For never yet a braver band
12852,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"To fight a ship, forsook the land,"
12853,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,Than Barclay had on board that day;--
12854,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"The guns were loosed the game to win,"
12855,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Their muzzles gaped a dismal grin,"
12856,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And out they pulled their tompion pin,"
12857,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,The bloody game of war to play.
12858,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12859,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"But Perry soon, with flowing sail,"
12860,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Advanced, determined to prevail,"
12861,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,When from his bull-dogs flew the hail
12862,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,Directed full at queen Charlotte.
12863,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"His wadded guns were aim'd so true,"
12864,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And such a weight of ball they threw,"
12865,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"As, Barclay said, he never knew"
12866,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"To come, before, so scalding hot!"
12867,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12868,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"But still, to animate his men"
12869,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,From gun to gun the warrior ran
12870,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,And blazed away and blazed again--
12871,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,Till Perry's ship was half a wreck:
12872,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"They tore away both tack and sheet,--"
12873,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Their victory might have been complete,"
12874,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Had Perry not, to shun defeat"
12875,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,In lucky moment left his deck.
12876,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12877,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Repairing to another post,"
12878,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,From another ship he fought their host
12879,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And soon regain'd the fortune lost,"
12880,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"And down, his flag the briton tore:"
12881,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,With loss of arm and loss of blood
12882,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Indignant, on his decks he stood"
12883,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,To witness Erie's crimson flood
12884,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"For miles around him, stain'd with gore!"
12885,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,
12886,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Thus, for dominion of the lake"
12887,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"These captains did each other rake,"
12888,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,And many a widow did they make;--
12889,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"Whose is the fault, or who to blame?--"
12890,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"The briton challenged with his sword,"
12891,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,"The yankee took him at his word,"
12892,THE BATTLE OF LAKE ERIE,With spirit laid him close on board--

14780,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,The Armstrong appear'd like all hell in a blaze!
14781,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,At the blast of Long Tom
14782,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,The foe was struck dumb:
14783,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,O lord! are the sons of old England alarm'd--
14784,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,With music like this they were formerly charm'd!
14785,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,
14786,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"Huzza for old England! three cheers, and a damn!"
14787,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,And up to the conflict they manfully came;
14788,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"On the bows and the quarters they grappled a hold,"
14789,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,And board! was the word in those barges so bold;
14790,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"But board they could not--to no devil she strikes,"
14791,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,So the Armstrong repell'd them with pistols and pikes--
14792,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,From her musquetry fire
14793,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,They by dozens expire!
14794,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"And soon was the work of destruction complete,"
14795,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,And soon was determined their total defeat--!
14796,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,
14797,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"Three hundred brave fellows were wounded and kill'd,"
14798,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Their boats and their barges with slaughter were fill'd;
14799,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"With shame they retreated, the few that remain'd,"
14800,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,To tell the event of the battle--not gain'd:
14801,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Their commander in chief
14802,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Was astounded with grief!--
14803,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"Dont grieve, my good fellows--he hail'd them--I beg"
14804,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"I too have my wounds--""an ox trod on my leg!"""
14805,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,
14806,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,But to save the stout Armstrong--even Reid could not do--
14807,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,A ship of the line with a frigate in tow--!
14808,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,A brig of their navy accoutred for war--!
14809,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,All this was too much for e'en yankees to dare:
14810,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,So he scuttled his barque--
14811,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Nor need we remark
14812,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,That she sunk on the sands by the beach of Fayal
14813,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,With her colors all flying--no colors could fall!
14814,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,
14815,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Of neutrals what nonsense some tell us each day!
14816,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Exists there a neutral where Britain has sway?
14817,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,The rights of a neutral!--away with such stuff--
14818,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,What neutral remains that can England rebuff?--
14819,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,To be safe from disgrace
14820,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,The deep seas are our place:
14821,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"The flag of no neutral our flag can defend,"
14822,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"By ourselves we must fight, on ourselves must depend."
14823,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,
14824,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"Now in bumpers of reason, success to brave Reid!"
14825,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Himself and his heroes are heroes indeed!--
14826,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"In conquests, like this, can an englishman glory,"
14827,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"One traitor among us, one Halifax tory?"
14828,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,If they can--let them brag--
14829,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,Here's success to our flag!
14830,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,"May it ever be ready, the britons to maul,"
14831,GENERAL ARMSTRONG,As the Armstrong behaved in the road of Fayal.--
