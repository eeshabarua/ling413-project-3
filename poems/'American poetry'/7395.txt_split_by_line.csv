52,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY
53,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
54,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"'T is like stirring living embers when, at eighty, one remembers"
55,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"All the achings and the quakings of ""the times that tried men's souls"";"
56,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"When I talk of Whig and Tory, when I tell the Rebel story,"
57,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"To you the words are ashes, but to me they're burning coals."
58,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
59,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,I had heard the muskets' rattle of the April running battle;
60,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Lord Percy's hunted soldiers, I can see their red-coats still;"
61,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"But a deadly chill comes o'er me, as the day looms up before me,"
62,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,When a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of Bunker's Hill.
63,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
64,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"'T was a peaceful summer's morning, when the first thing gave us warning"
65,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Was the booming of the cannon from the river and the shore:
66,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Child,"" says grandma, ""what 's the matter, what is all this noise and"
67,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,clatter?
68,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Have those scalping Indian devils come to murder us once more?"""
69,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
70,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Poor old soul! my sides were shaking in the midst of all my quaking,"
71,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,To hear her talk of Indians when the guns began to roar:
72,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"She had seen the burning village, and the slaughter and the pillage,"
73,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,When the Mohawks killed her father with their bullets through his door.
74,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
75,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Then I said, ""Now, dear old granny, don't you fret and worry any,"
76,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,For I'll soon come back and tell you whether this is work or play;
77,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"There can't be mischief in it, so I won't be gone a minute""--"
78,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,For a minute then I started. I was gone the live-long day.
79,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
80,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,No time for bodice-lacing or for looking-glass grimacing;
81,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Down my hair went as I hurried, tumbling half-way to my heels;"
82,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"God forbid your ever knowing, when there's blood around her flowing,"
83,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"How the lonely, helpless daughter of a quiet house-hold feels!"
84,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
85,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,In the street I heard a thumping; and I knew it was the stumping
86,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Of the Corporal, our old neighbor, on that wooden leg he wore,"
87,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"With a knot of women round him,-it was lucky I had found him,"
88,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"So I followed with the others, and the Corporal marched before."
89,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
90,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"They were making for the steeple,--the old soldier and his people;"
91,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,The pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creaking stair.
92,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Just across the narrow river--oh, so close it made me shiver!--"
93,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Stood a fortress on the hill-top that but yesterday was bare.
94,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
95,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Not slow our eyes to find it; well we knew who stood behind it,"
96,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Though the earthwork hid them from us, and the stubborn walls were dumb"
97,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Here were sister, wife, and mother, looking wild upon each other,"
98,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And their lips were white with terror as they said, THE HOUR HAS COME!"
99,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
100,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"The morning slowly wasted, not a morsel had we tasted,"
101,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And our heads were almost splitting with the cannons' deafening thrill,"
102,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode sedately;
103,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"It was PRESCOTT, one since told me; he commanded on the hill."
104,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
105,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Every woman's heart grew bigger when we saw his manly figure,"
106,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"With the banyan buckled round it, standing up so straight and tall;"
107,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for pleasure,"
108,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Through the storm of shells and cannon-shot he walked around the wall.
109,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
110,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"At eleven the streets were swarming, for the red-coats' ranks were"
111,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,forming;
112,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,At noon in marching order they were moving to the piers;
113,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"How the bayonets gleamed and glistened, as we looked far down, and"
114,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,listened
115,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,To the trampling and the drum-beat of the belted grenadiers!
116,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
117,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"At length the men have started, with a cheer (it seemed faint-hearted),"
118,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"In their scarlet regimentals, with their knapsacks on their backs,"
119,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And the reddening, rippling water, as after a sea-fight's slaughter,"
120,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood along their tracks.
121,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
122,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"So they crossed to the other border, and again they formed in order;"
123,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And the boats came back for soldiers, came for soldiers, soldiers still:"
124,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"The time seemed everlasting to us women faint and fasting,--"
125,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"At last they're moving, marching, marching proudly up the hill."
126,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
127,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"We can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines advancing,--"
128,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Now the front rank fires a volley,--they have thrown away their shot;"
129,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"For behind their earthwork lying, all the balls above them flying,"
130,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Our people need not hurry; so they wait and answer not.
131,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
132,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Then the Corporal, our old cripple (he would swear sometimes and tipple),"
133,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"He had heard the bullets whistle (in the old French war) before,--"
134,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Calls out in words of jeering, just as if they all were hearing,--"
135,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,And his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry floor:--
136,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
137,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Oh! fire away, ye villains, and earn King George's shillin's,"
138,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,But ye 'll waste a ton of powder afore a 'rebel' falls;
139,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"You may bang the dirt and welcome, they're as safe as Dan'l Malcolm"
140,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Ten foot beneath the gravestone that you've splintered with your balls!"""
141,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
142,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"In the hush of expectation, in the awe and trepidation"
143,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Of the dread approaching moment, we are well-nigh breathless all;"
144,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry railing,"
145,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,We are crowding up against them like the waves against a wall.
146,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
147,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Just a glimpse (the air is clearer), they are nearer,--nearer,--nearer,"
148,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,When a flash--a curling smoke-wreath--then a crash--the steeple shakes--
149,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,The deadly truce is ended; the tempest's shroud is rended;
150,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Like a morning mist it gathered, like a thunder-cloud it breaks!"
151,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
152,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Oh the sight our eyes discover as the blue-black smoke blows over!
153,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,The red-coats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes his hay;
154,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Here a scarlet heap is lying, there a headlong crowd is flying"
155,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Like a billow that has broken and is shivered into spray.
156,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
157,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Then we cried, ""The troops are routed! they are beat--it can't be"
158,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,doubted!
159,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"God be thanked, the fight is over!""--Ah! the grim old soldier's smile!"
160,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Tell us, tell us why you look so?"" (we could hardly speak, we shook so),"
161,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Are they beaten? Are they beaten? ARE they beaten?""--""Wait a while."""
162,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
163,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Oh the trembling and the terror! for too soon we saw our error:
164,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"They are baffled, not defeated; we have driven them back in vain;"
165,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And the columns that were scattered, round the colors that were tattered,"
166,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Toward the sullen, silent fortress turn their belted breasts again."
167,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
168,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"All at once, as we are gazing, lo the roofs of Charlestown blazing!"
169,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,They have fired the harmless village; in an hour it will be down!
170,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"The Lord in heaven confound them, rain his fire and brimstone round them,"
171,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"The robbing, murdering red-coats, that would burn a peaceful town!"
172,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
173,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"They are marching, stern and solemn; we can see each massive column"
174,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,As they near the naked earth-mound with the slanting walls so steep.
175,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Have our soldiers got faint-hearted, and in noiseless haste departed?"
176,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Are they panic-struck and helpless? Are they palsied or asleep?
177,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
178,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Now! the walls they're almost under! scarce a rod the foes asunder!
179,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Not a firelock flashed against them! up the earth-work they will swarm!
180,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"But the words have scarce been spoken, when the ominous calm is broken,"
181,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,And a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance of the storm!
182,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
183,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"So again, with murderous slaughter, pelted backwards to the water,"
184,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Fly Pigot's running heroes and the frightened braves of Howe;
185,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And we shout, ""At last they're done for, it's their barges they have run"
186,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,for:
187,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"They are beaten, beaten, beaten; and the battle 's over now!"""
188,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
189,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And we looked, poor timid creatures, on the rough old soldier's features,"
190,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Our lips afraid to question, but he knew what we would ask:"
191,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Not sure,"" he said; ""keep quiet,--once more, I guess, they 'll try it--"
192,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Here's damnation to the cut-throats!""--then he handed me his flask,"
193,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
194,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Saying, ""Gal, you're looking shaky; have a drop of old Jamaiky;"
195,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"I 'm afeard there 'll be more trouble afore the job is done"";"
196,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"So I took one scorching swallow; dreadful faint I felt and hollow,"
197,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Standing there from early morning when the firing was begun.
198,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
199,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"All through those hours of trial I had watched a calm clock dial,"
200,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"As the hands kept creeping, creeping,--they were creeping round to four,"
201,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"When the old man said, ""They're forming with their bagonets fixed for"
202,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,storming:
203,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"It 's the death-grip that's a coming,--they will try the works once"
204,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"more."""
205,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
206,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"With brazen trumpets blaring, the flames behind them glaring,"
207,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"The deadly wall before them, in close array they come;"
208,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Still onward, upward toiling, like a dragon's fold uncoiling,--"
209,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,Like the rattlesnake's shrill warning the reverberating drum.
210,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
211,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Over heaps all torn and gory--shall I tell the fearful story,"
212,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"How they surged above the breastwork, as a sea breaks over a deck;"
213,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"How, driven, yet scarce defeated, our worn-out men retreated,"
214,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"With their powder-horns all emptied, like the swimmers from a wreck?"
215,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
216,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"It has all been told and painted; as for me, they say I fainted,"
217,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,And the wooden-legged old Corporal stumped with me down the stair:
218,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"When I woke from dreams affrighted the evening lamps were lighted,--"
219,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,On the floor a youth was lying; his bleeding breast was bare.
220,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
221,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And I heard through all the flurry, ""Send for WARREN! hurry! hurry!"
222,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Tell him here's a soldier bleeding, and he 'll come and dress his"
223,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"wound!"""
224,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Ah, we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death and sorrow,"
225,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,How the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and bloody ground.
226,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
227,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Who the youth was, what his name was, where the place from which he came"
228,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"was,"
229,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Who had brought him from the battle, and had left him at our door,"
230,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"He could not speak to tell us; but 't was one of our brave fellows,"
231,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,As the homespun plainly showed us which the dying soldier wore.
232,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
233,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"For they all thought he was dying, as they gathered round him crying,--"
234,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And they said, ""Oh, how they'll miss him!"" and, ""What will his mother"
235,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"do?"""
236,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Then, his eyelids just unclosing like a child's that has been dozing,"
237,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"He faintly murmured, ""Mother!""--and--I saw his eyes were blue."
238,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
239,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Why, grandma, how you 're winking!"" Ah, my child, it sets me thinking"
240,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Of a story not like this one. Well, he somehow lived along;"
241,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"So we came to know each other, and I nursed him like a--mother,"
242,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"Till at last he stood before me, tall, and rosy-checked, and strong."
243,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,
244,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"And we sometimes walked together in the pleasant summer weather,--"
245,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"""Please to tell us what his name was?"" Just your own, my little dear,--"
246,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"There's his picture Copley painted: we became so well acquainted,"
247,AS SHE SAW IT FROM THE BELFRY,"That--in short, that's why I 'm grandma, and you children all are here!"

260,"DECEMBER 15, 1874",But pray what's the reason that I am expected to?

1507,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Asks heavenly guidance; finds the chapter's place
1508,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",That tells some tale of Israel's stubborn race;
1509,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Gives out the sacred song; all voices join,"
1510,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",For no quartette extorts their scanty coin;
1511,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Then while both hands their black-gloved palms display,"
1512,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Lifts his gray head, and murmurs, ""Let us pray!"""
1513,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And pray he does! as one that never fears
1514,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",To plead unanswered by the God that hears;
1515,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",What if he dwells on many a fact as though
1516,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Some things Heaven knew not which it ought to know,--"
1517,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Thanks God for all his favors past, and yet,"
1518,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Tells Him there's something He must not forget;
1519,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Such are the prayers his people love to hear,--"
1520,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",See how the Deacon slants his listening ear!
1521,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","What! look once more! Nay, surely there I trace"
1522,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The hinted outlines of a well-known face!
1523,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Not those the lips for laughter to beguile,"
1524,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Yet round their corners lurks an embryo smile,"
1525,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The same on other lips my childhood knew
1526,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",That scarce the Sabbath's mastery could subdue.
1527,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Him too my lineage gives me leave to claim,--"
1528,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The good, grave man that bears the Psalmist's name."
1529,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
1530,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And still in ceaseless round the seasons passed;
1531,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Spring piped her carol; Autumn blew his blast;
1532,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Babes waxed to manhood; manhood shrunk to age;
1533,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Life's worn-out players tottered off the stage;
1534,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The few are many; boys have grown to men
1535,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Since Putnam dragged the wolf from Pomfret's den;
1536,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Our new-old Woodstock is a thriving town;
1537,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Brave are her children; faithful to the crown;
1538,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Her soldiers' steel the savage redskin knows;
1539,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Their blood has crimsoned his Canadian snows.
1540,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And now once more along the quiet vale
1541,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Rings the dread call that turns the mothers pale;
1542,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Full well they know the valorous heat that runs
1543,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In every pulse-beat of their loyal sons;
1544,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Who would not bleed in good King George's cause
1545,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",When England's lion shows his teeth and claws?
1546,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",With glittering firelocks on the village green
1547,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",In proud array a martial band is seen;
1548,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","You know what names those ancient rosters hold,--"
1549,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose belts were buckled when the drum-beat rolled,--"
1550,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","But mark their Captain! tell us, who is he?"
1551,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",On his brown face that same old look I see
1552,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Yes! from the homestead's still retreat he came,"
1553,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Whose peaceful owner bore the Psalmist's name;
1554,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The same his own. Well, Israel's glorious king"
1555,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Who struck the harp could also whirl the sling,--"
1556,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Breathe in his song a penitential sigh
1557,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And smite the sons of Amalek hip and thigh:
1558,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","These shared their task; one deaconed out the psalm,"
1559,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",One slashed the scalping hell-hounds of calm;
1560,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The praying father's pious work is done,"
1561,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Now sword in hand steps forth the fighting son.
1562,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",On many a field he fought in wilds afar;
1563,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",See on his swarthy cheek the bullet's scar!
1564,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","There hangs a murderous tomahawk; beneath,"
1565,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Without its blade, a knife's embroidered sheath;"
1566,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Save for the stroke his trusty weapon dealt
1567,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",His scalp had dangled at their owner's belt;
1568,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",But not for him such fate; he lived to see
1569,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The bloodier strife that made our nation free,"
1570,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","To serve with willing toil, with skilful hand,"
1571,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The war-worn saviors of the bleeding land.
1572,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","His wasting life to others' needs he gave,--"
1573,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Sought rest in home and found it in the grave.
1574,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","See where the stones life's brief memorials keep,"
1575,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The tablet telling where he ""fell on sleep,""--"
1576,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Watched by a winged cherub's rayless eye,--"
1577,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","A scroll above that says we all must die,--"
1578,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Those saddening lines beneath, the ""Night-Thoughts"" lent:"
1579,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","So stands the Soldier's, Surgeon's monument."
1580,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Ah! at a glance my filial eye divines
1581,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The scholar son in those remembered lines.
1582,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
1583,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",The Scholar Son. His hand my footsteps led.
1584,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No more the dim unreal past I tread.
1585,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","O thou whose breathing form was once so dear,"
1586,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose cheering voice was music to my ear,"
1587,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Art thou not with me as my feet pursue
1588,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The village paths so well thy boyhood knew,"
1589,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Along the tangled margin of the stream
1590,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose murmurs blended with thine infant dream,"
1591,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Or climb the hill, or thread the wooded vale,"
1592,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Or seek the wave where gleams yon distant sail,"
1593,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Or the old homestead's narrowed bounds explore,"
1594,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Where sloped the roof that sheds the rains no more,"
1595,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Where one last relic still remains to tell
1596,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Here stood thy home,--the memory-haunted well,"
1597,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Whose waters quench a deeper thirst than thine,"
1598,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Changed at my lips to sacramental wine,--"
1599,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Art thou not with me, as I fondly trace"
1600,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","The scanty records of thine honored race,"
1601,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Call up the forms that earlier years have known,"
1602,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",And spell the legend of each slanted stone?
1603,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","With thoughts of thee my loving verse began,"
1604,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Not for the critic's curious eye to scan,"
1605,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Not for the many listeners, but the few"
1606,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Whose fathers trod the paths my fathers knew;
1607,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Still in my heart thy loved remembrance burns;
1608,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Still to my lips thy cherished name returns;
1609,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Could I but feel thy gracious presence near
1610,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Amid the groves that once to thee were dear
1611,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Could but my trembling lips with mortal speech
1612,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Thy listening ear for one brief moment reach!
1613,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",How vain the dream! The pallid voyager's track
1614,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No sign betrays; he sends no message back.
1615,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",No word from thee since evening's shadow fell
1616,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","On thy cold forehead with my long farewell,--"
1617,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877","Now from the margin of the silent sea,"
1618,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",Take my last offering ere I cross to thee!
1619,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
1620,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
1621,"WOODSTOCK, CONN., JULY 4, 1877",
