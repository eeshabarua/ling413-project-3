178,BRUTUS AND ANTONY,
179,B.C. 20,B.C. 20
180,B.C. 20,
181,B.C. 20,
182,B.C. 20,How shall I write this out? I do not write.
183,B.C. 20,"Talk to you? Yes, and tell of Antony,"
184,B.C. 20,And how I knew him. There at Philippi
185,B.C. 20,"I let myself be captured, so to give"
186,B.C. 20,Time to escape to Brutus--made pretense
187,B.C. 20,"That I was Brutus, and so Brutus flies"
188,B.C. 20,"And I am captured. Antony forgives me,"
189,B.C. 20,And to his death I was his faithful friend.
190,B.C. 20,"Well, after Actium, in Africa,"
191,B.C. 20,"He roamed with no companions but us two,"
192,B.C. 20,"Our friend Aristocrates, here, myself,"
193,B.C. 20,And fed upon his bitter heart. Our guest
194,B.C. 20,"Nods truth to what I say, he knows it all."
195,B.C. 20,And after certain days in solitude
196,B.C. 20,"He seeks his Cleopatra. As for her,"
197,B.C. 20,She was the sovereign queen of many nations;
198,B.C. 20,"Yet that she might be with her Antony,"
199,B.C. 20,"Live with him and enjoy him, did not shun"
200,B.C. 20,"The name of mistress, and let Fulvia keep"
201,B.C. 20,"Her wifehood without envy. As for him,"
202,B.C. 20,"A lover’s soul lives in the loved one’s body,"
203,B.C. 20,"And where bode Cleopatra, there his soul"
204,B.C. 20,"Lived only, though his feet of flesh pursued"
205,B.C. 20,"The Parthian, or Cæsar’s hateful heir...."
206,B.C. 20,And if this Antony would wreathe his spear
207,B.C. 20,With ivy like a thyrsus; from the chamber
208,B.C. 20,"Of his beloved rush to battle, helmet"
209,B.C. 20,Smelling of unguents and of Egypt; leave
210,B.C. 20,Great action and great enterprise to play
211,B.C. 20,Along the seashore of Canopus with her;
212,B.C. 20,"And fly the combat, not as Paris did,"
213,B.C. 20,"Already beaten, with lift sail, desert"
214,B.C. 20,"The victory that was his, yet true it is"
215,B.C. 20,"His rank, his eloquence, his liberal blood,"
216,B.C. 20,"His interest in all grades and breeds of men,"
217,B.C. 20,"His pity and his kindness to the sick,"
218,B.C. 20,"His generous sympathies, stamped Antony"
219,B.C. 20,"A giant in this dusty, roaring place"
220,B.C. 20,Which we call earth. Who ruined Antony?
221,B.C. 20,"Why, Brutus! For he gave to Antony"
222,B.C. 20,The truth of which the Queen of Egypt stood
223,B.C. 20,As proof in the flesh:--Beauty and Life. His heart
224,B.C. 20,"Was apt to see her for mad days in Rome,"
225,B.C. 20,And soul created sateless for the cup
226,B.C. 20,Of ecstasy in living.
227,B.C. 20,On a day
228,B.C. 20,"Myself and Aristocrates and Antony,"
229,B.C. 20,"We two companioning him in Africa,"
230,B.C. 20,"Wandering in solitary places, Antony"
231,B.C. 20,"Brooding on Actium, and the love that kept"
232,B.C. 20,"His soul with Cleopatra, up he speaks,"
233,B.C. 20,"And asks us if we knew what Brutus said,"
234,B.C. 20,"While nearing death, to Cassius. “No,” we said."
235,B.C. 20,And Antony began to tell of Brutus:--
236,B.C. 20,"How all his life was spent in study, how"
237,B.C. 20,"He starved his body, slept but briefly, cut"
238,B.C. 20,His hours of sleep by practice; fixed his thought
239,B.C. 20,On virtue and on glory; made himself
240,B.C. 20,A zealot of one purpose: liberty;
241,B.C. 20,A spirit as of a beast that knows one thing:
242,B.C. 20,Its food and how to get it; over its spirit
243,B.C. 20,No heaven keeps of changing light; no stars
244,B.C. 20,Of wandering thought; no moons that charm
245,B.C. 20,"Still groves by singing waters, and no suns"
246,B.C. 20,"Of large illumination, showing life"
247,B.C. 20,"As multiform and fathomless, filled with wings"
248,B.C. 20,"Of various truth, each true as other truth."
249,B.C. 20,"This was that Brutus, made an asp by thought"
250,B.C. 20,"And nature, to be used by envious hands"
251,B.C. 20,And placed to Cæsar’s breast. So Antony
252,B.C. 20,"Discoursed upon our walk, and capped it off"
253,B.C. 20,With Brutus’ words when dying. They were these:
254,B.C. 20,"“O virtue, miserable virtue, bawd and cheat;"
255,B.C. 20,Thou wert a bare word and I followed thee
256,B.C. 20,"As if thou hadst been real. But even as evil,"
257,B.C. 20,"Lust, ignorance, thou wert the plaything too"
258,B.C. 20,Of fortune and of chance.”
259,B.C. 20,So Antony
260,B.C. 20,"Consoled himself with Brutus, sighed and lapsed"
261,B.C. 20,"To silence; thinking, as we deemed, of life"
262,B.C. 20,"And what it yet could be, and how ’twould end;"
263,B.C. 20,"And how to join his Cleopatra, what"
264,B.C. 20,The days would hold amid the toppling walls
265,B.C. 20,"Of Rome in demolition, now the hand"
266,B.C. 20,"Of Cæsar rotted, and no longer stayed"
267,B.C. 20,The picks and catapults of an idiot world!
268,B.C. 20,"So, as it seemed, he would excuse himself"
269,B.C. 20,For Actium and his way in life. For soon
270,B.C. 20,"He speaks again, of Theophrastus now,"
271,B.C. 20,"Who lived a hundred years, spent all his life"
272,B.C. 20,"In study and in writing, brought to death"
273,B.C. 20,By labor; dying lay encompassed by
274,B.C. 20,"Two thousand followers, disciples, preachers"
275,B.C. 20,Of what he taught; and dying was penitent
276,B.C. 20,"For glory, even as Brutus was penitent"
277,B.C. 20,For virtue later. And so Antony
278,B.C. 20,"Spoke Theophrastus’ dying words, and told"
279,B.C. 20,How Theophrastus by a follower
280,B.C. 20,"Asked for a last commandment, spoke these words:"
281,B.C. 20,“There is none. But ’tis folly to cast away
282,B.C. 20,Pleasure for glory! And no love is worse
283,B.C. 20,Than love of glory. Look upon my life:--
284,B.C. 20,Its toil and hard denial! To what end?
285,B.C. 20,"Therefore live happy; study, if you must,"
286,B.C. 20,For fame and happiness. Life’s vanity
287,B.C. 20,Exceeds its usefulness.”
288,B.C. 20,So speaking thus
289,B.C. 20,Wise Theophrastus died.
290,B.C. 20,Now I have said
291,B.C. 20,"That Brutus ruined Antony. So he did,"
292,B.C. 20,If Antony were ruined--that’s the question.
293,B.C. 20,"For Antony hearing Brutus say, “O virtue,"
294,B.C. 20,"Miserable virtue, bawd and cheat,” and seeing"
295,B.C. 20,"The eyes of Brutus stare in death, threw over him"
296,B.C. 20,"A scarlet mantle, and took to his heart"
297,B.C. 20,The dying words of Brutus.
298,B.C. 20,
299,B.C. 20,It is true
300,B.C. 20,That Cicero said Antony as a youth
301,B.C. 20,"Was odious for drinking-bouts, amours,"
302,B.C. 20,"For bacchanals, luxurious life, and true"
303,B.C. 20,"When as triumvir, after Cæsar’s death,"
304,B.C. 20,"He kept the house of Pompey, where he lived,"
305,B.C. 20,"Filled up with jugglers, drunkards, flatterers."
306,B.C. 20,"All this before the death of Brutus, or"
307,B.C. 20,His love for Cleopatra. But it’s true
308,B.C. 20,"He was great Cæsar’s colleague. Cæsar dead,"
309,B.C. 20,"This Antony is chief ruler of all Rome,"
310,B.C. 20,"And wars in Greece, and Asia. So it’s true"
311,B.C. 20,"He was not wholly given to the cup,"
312,B.C. 20,"But knew fatigue and battle, hunger too,"
313,B.C. 20,"Living on roots in Parthia. Yet, you see,"
314,B.C. 20,"With Cæsar slaughtered in the capitol,"
315,B.C. 20,"His friend, almost his god; and Brutus gasping"
316,B.C. 20,“O miserable virtue”; and the feet of men
317,B.C. 20,"From Syria to Hispania, slipping off"
318,B.C. 20,"The world that broke in pieces, like an island"
319,B.C. 20,Falling apart beneath a heaving tide--
320,B.C. 20,Whence from its flocculent fragment wretches leap--
321,B.C. 20,"You see it was no wonder for this Antony,"
322,B.C. 20,"Made what he was by nature and by life,"
323,B.C. 20,"In such a time and fate of the drifting world,"
324,B.C. 20,"To turn to Cleopatra, and leave war"
325,B.C. 20,And rulership to languish.
326,B.C. 20,Thus it was:
327,B.C. 20,"Cæsar is slaughtered, Antony must avenge"
328,B.C. 20,"The death of Cæsar. Brutus is brought to death,"
329,B.C. 20,And dying scoffs at virtue which took off
330,B.C. 20,In Brutus’ hand the sovran life of Cæsar.
331,B.C. 20,And soon our Antony must fight against
332,B.C. 20,"The recreant hordes of Asia, finding here"
333,B.C. 20,His Cleopatra for coadjutor....
334,B.C. 20,"He’s forty-two and ripe. She’s twenty-eight,"
335,B.C. 20,"Fruit fresh and blushing, most mature and rich;"
336,B.C. 20,Her voice an instrument of many strings
337,B.C. 20,"That yielded laughter, wisdom, folly, song,"
338,B.C. 20,"And tales of many lands, in Arabic,"
339,B.C. 20,"And Hebrew, Syriac and Parthiac."
340,B.C. 20,"She spoke the language of the troglodytes,"
341,B.C. 20,The Medes and others. And when Antony
342,B.C. 20,"Sent for her in Cilicia, she took time,"
343,B.C. 20,"Ignored his orders, leisurely at last"
344,B.C. 20,Sailed up the Cydnus in a barge whose stern
345,B.C. 20,"Was gilded, and with purple sails. Returned"
346,B.C. 20,"His dining invitation with her own,"
347,B.C. 20,"And bent his will to hers. He went to her,"
348,B.C. 20,And found a banquet richer than his largess
349,B.C. 20,"Could give her. For while feasting, branches sunk"
350,B.C. 20,"Around them, budding lights in squares and circles,"
351,B.C. 20,"And lighted up their heaven, as with stars."
352,B.C. 20,"She found him broad and gross, but joined her taste"
353,B.C. 20,To him in this. And then their love began.
354,B.C. 20,And while his Fulvia kept his quarrels alive
355,B.C. 20,"With force of arms in Rome on Octavianus,"
356,B.C. 20,"And while the Parthian threatened Syria,"
357,B.C. 20,He lets the Queen of Egypt take him off
358,B.C. 20,"To Alexandria, where he joins with her"
359,B.C. 20,The Inimitable Livers; and in holiday
360,B.C. 20,"Plays like a boy and riots, while great Brutus"
361,B.C. 20,Is rotting in the earth for Virtue’s sake;
362,B.C. 20,And Theophrastus for three hundred years
363,B.C. 20,"Has changed from dust to grass, and grass to dust!"
364,B.C. 20,And Cleopatra’s kitchen groans with food.
365,B.C. 20,Eight boars are roasted whole--though only twelve
366,B.C. 20,"Of these Inimitable Livers, with the Queen"
367,B.C. 20,And Antony are to eat--that every dish
368,B.C. 20,May be served up just roasted to a turn.
369,B.C. 20,And who knows when Marc Antony may sup?
370,B.C. 20,"Perhaps this hour, perhaps another hour,"
371,B.C. 20,"Perhaps this minute he may call for wine,"
372,B.C. 20,Or start to talk with Cleopatra; fish--
373,B.C. 20,For fish they did together. On a day
374,B.C. 20,"They fished together, and his luck was ill,"
375,B.C. 20,And so he ordered fishermen to dive
376,B.C. 20,And put upon his hook fish caught before.
377,B.C. 20,"And Cleopatra feigned to be deceived,"
378,B.C. 20,And shouted out his luck. Next day invited
379,B.C. 20,"The Inimitable Livers down to see him fish,"
380,B.C. 20,Whereat she had a diver fix his hook
381,B.C. 20,With a salted fish from Pontus. Antony
382,B.C. 20,Drew up amid their laughter. Then she said:
383,B.C. 20,"“Sweet Antony, leave us poor sovereigns here,"
384,B.C. 20,"Of Pharos and Canopus, to the rod;"
385,B.C. 20,"Your game is cities, provinces and kingdoms.”"
386,B.C. 20,"Were Antony serious, or disposed to mirth?"
387,B.C. 20,"She had some new delight. She diced with him,"
388,B.C. 20,"Drank with him, hunted with him. When he went"
389,B.C. 20,"To exercise in arms, she sat to see."
390,B.C. 20,"At night she rambled with him in the streets,"
391,B.C. 20,"Dressed like a servant-woman, making mischief"
392,B.C. 20,At people’s doors. And Antony disguised
393,B.C. 20,"Got scurvy answers, beatings from the folk,"
394,B.C. 20,Tormented in their houses. So it went
395,B.C. 20,"Till Actium. She loved him, let him be"
396,B.C. 20,"By day nor night alone, at every turn"
397,B.C. 20,Was with him and upon him.
398,B.C. 20,
399,B.C. 20,"Well, this life"
400,B.C. 20,"Was neither virtue, glory, fame, nor study,"
401,B.C. 20,"But it was life, and life that did not slay"
402,B.C. 20,A Cæsar for a word like Liberty.
403,B.C. 20,"And it was life, its essence nor changed nor lost"
404,B.C. 20,"By Actium, where his soul shot forth to her"
405,B.C. 20,"As from a catapult a stone is cast,"
406,B.C. 20,Seeing her lift her sixty sails and fly.
407,B.C. 20,His soul lived in her body as ’twere born
408,B.C. 20,"A part of her, and whithersoever she went"
409,B.C. 20,There followed he. And all their life together
410,B.C. 20,"Was what it was, a rapture, justified"
411,B.C. 20,"By its essential honey of realest blossoms,"
412,B.C. 20,In spite of anguished shame. When hauled aboard
413,B.C. 20,"The ship of Cleopatra, he sat down"
414,B.C. 20,And with his two hands covered up his face!
415,B.C. 20,Brutus had penitence at Philippi
416,B.C. 20,For virtue which befooled him. Antony
417,B.C. 20,Remorse and terror there at Actium
418,B.C. 20,"Deserting with his queen, for love that made"
419,B.C. 20,"His body not his own, as Brutus’ will"
420,B.C. 20,Was subject to the magic of a word....
421,B.C. 20,"For what is Virtue, what is Love? At least"
422,B.C. 20,"We know their dire effects, that both befool,"
423,B.C. 20,"Betray, destroy."
424,B.C. 20,
425,B.C. 20,The Queen and Antony
426,B.C. 20,"Had joined the Inimitable Livers, now they joined"
427,B.C. 20,The Diers Together. They had kept how oft
428,B.C. 20,"The Festival of Flagons, now to keep"
429,B.C. 20,The Ritual of Passing Life was theirs.
430,B.C. 20,But first they suffered anger with each other
431,B.C. 20,"While on her ship, till touching Tenarus"
432,B.C. 20,"When they were brought to speak by women friends,"
433,B.C. 20,At last to eat and sleep together. Yet
434,B.C. 20,"Poison had fallen on their leaves, which stripped"
435,B.C. 20,"Their greenness to the stalk, as you shall see...."
436,B.C. 20,"Here to make clear what flight of Antony meant,"
437,B.C. 20,"For cause how base or natural, let me say"
438,B.C. 20,That Actium’s battle had not been a loss
439,B.C. 20,"To Antony and his honor, if Canidius,"
440,B.C. 20,"Commanding under Antony, had not flown"
441,B.C. 20,In imitation of his chief; the soldiers
442,B.C. 20,Fought desperately in hope that Antony
443,B.C. 20,Would come again and lead them.
444,B.C. 20,
445,B.C. 20,So it was
446,B.C. 20,"He touched, with Cleopatra, Africa,"
447,B.C. 20,"And sent her into Egypt; and with us,"
448,B.C. 20,"Myself and Aristocrates, walked and brooded"
449,B.C. 20,"In solitary places, as I said."
450,B.C. 20,But when he came to Alexandria
451,B.C. 20,He finds his Cleopatra dragging her fleet
452,B.C. 20,Over the land space which divides the sea
453,B.C. 20,"Near Egypt from the Red Sea, so to float"
454,B.C. 20,"Her fleet in the Arabian Gulf, and there,"
455,B.C. 20,"Somewhere upon earth’s other side, to find"
456,B.C. 20,A home secure from war and slavery.
457,B.C. 20,"She failed in this; but Antony leaves the city,"
458,B.C. 20,"And leaves his queen, plays Timon, builds a house"
459,B.C. 20,Near Pharos on a little mole; lives here
460,B.C. 20,Until he hears all princes and all kings
461,B.C. 20,Desert him in the realm of Rome; which news
462,B.C. 20,"Brings gladness to him, for hope put away,"
463,B.C. 20,"And cares slipped off. Then leaving Timoneum,--"
464,B.C. 20,For such he named his dwelling there near Pharos--
465,B.C. 20,"He goes to Cleopatra, is received,"
466,B.C. 20,And sets the city feasting once again.
467,B.C. 20,"The order of Inimitable Livers breaks,"
468,B.C. 20,And forms the Diers Together in its place.
469,B.C. 20,"And all who banquet with them, take the oath"
470,B.C. 20,"To die with Antony and Cleopatra,"
471,B.C. 20,Observing her preoccupation with
472,B.C. 20,Drugs poisonous and creatures venomous.
473,B.C. 20,And thus their feast of flagons and of love
474,B.C. 20,In many courses riotously consumed
475,B.C. 20,Awaits the radiate liquor dazzling through
476,B.C. 20,"Their unimagined terror, like the rays"
477,B.C. 20,"Shot from the bright eyes of the cockatrice,"
478,B.C. 20,Crackling for poison in the crystal served
479,B.C. 20,By fleshless hands! A skeleton steward soon
480,B.C. 20,"Will pass the liquer to them; they will drink,"
481,B.C. 20,"And leave no message, no commandment either--"
482,B.C. 20,As Theophrastus was reluctant to--
483,B.C. 20,Denied disciples; for Inimitable Livers
484,B.C. 20,"Raise up no followers, create no faith,"
485,B.C. 20,"No cult or sect. Joy has his special wisdom,"
486,B.C. 20,"Which dies with him who learned it, does not fire"
487,B.C. 20,Mad bosoms like your Virtue.
488,B.C. 20,
489,B.C. 20,I must note
490,B.C. 20,"The proffered favors, honors of young Cæsar"
491,B.C. 20,"To Cleopatra, if she’d put to death"
492,B.C. 20,"Her Antony; and Antony’s jealousy,"
493,B.C. 20,"Aroused by Thyrsus, messenger of Cæsar,"
494,B.C. 20,"Whom Cleopatra gave long audiences,"
495,B.C. 20,"And special courtesies; seized, whipped at last"
496,B.C. 20,"By Antony, sent back to Cæsar. Yet"
497,B.C. 20,The queen was faithful. When her birth-day came
498,B.C. 20,"She kept it suitable to her fallen state,"
499,B.C. 20,"But all the while paying her Antony love,"
500,B.C. 20,"And honor, kept his birth-day with such richness"
501,B.C. 20,That guests who came in want departed rich ...
502,B.C. 20,
503,B.C. 20,"Wine, weariness, much living, early age"
504,B.C. 20,Made fall for Antony. October’s clouds
505,B.C. 20,"In man’s life, like October, have no sun"
506,B.C. 20,"To lift the mists of doubt, distortion, fear."
507,B.C. 20,"Faces, events, and wills around us show"
508,B.C. 20,"Malformed, or ugly, changed from what they were."
509,B.C. 20,And when his troops desert him in the city
510,B.C. 20,"To Cæsar, Antony cries out, the queen,"
511,B.C. 20,"His Cleopatra, has betrayed him. She"
512,B.C. 20,"In terror seeks her monument, sends word"
513,B.C. 20,That she is dead. And Antony believes
514,B.C. 20,"And says delay no longer, stabs himself,"
515,B.C. 20,"Is hauled up dying to the arms of her,"
516,B.C. 20,Where midst her frantic wailings he expires!
517,B.C. 20,Kings and commanders begged of Cæsar grace
518,B.C. 20,To give this Antony his funeral rites.
519,B.C. 20,But Cæsar left the body with the queen
520,B.C. 20,Who buried it with royal pomp and splendor.
521,B.C. 20,"Thus died at fifty-six Marc Antony,"
522,B.C. 20,"And Cleopatra followed him with poison,"
523,B.C. 20,"The asp or hollow bodkin, having lived"
524,B.C. 20,"To thirty-nine, and reigned with Antony"
525,B.C. 20,As partner in the empire fourteen years ...
526,B.C. 20,
527,B.C. 20,"Who in a time to come will gorge and drink,"
528,B.C. 20,"Filch treasure that it may be spent for wine,"
529,B.C. 20,"Kill as Marc Antony did, war as he did,"
530,B.C. 20,"Because Marc Antony did so, taking him"
531,B.C. 20,"As warrant and exemplar? Why, never a soul!"
532,B.C. 20,"These things are done by souls who do not think,"
533,B.C. 20,But act from feeling. But those mad for stars
534,B.C. 20,Glimpsed in wild waters or through mountain mists
535,B.C. 20,Seen ruddy and portentous will take Brutus
536,B.C. 20,"As inspiration, since for Virtue’s sake"
537,B.C. 20,And for the good of Rome he killed his friend;
538,B.C. 20,And in the act made Liberty as far
539,B.C. 20,"From things of self, as murder is apart"
540,B.C. 20,"From friendship and its ways. Yes, Brutus lives"
541,B.C. 20,To fire the mad-men of the centuries
542,B.C. 20,As Cæsar lives to guide new tyrants. Yet
543,B.C. 20,Tyrannicide but snips the serpent’s head.
544,B.C. 20,The body of a rotten state still writhes
545,B.C. 20,"And wriggles though the head is gone, or worse,"
546,B.C. 20,Festers and stinks against the setting sun....
547,B.C. 20,
548,B.C. 20,Marc Antony lived happier than Brutus
549,B.C. 20,And left the old world happier for his life
550,B.C. 20,Than Brutus left it.

555,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN
556,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
557,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"(_April 10th, 1613_)"
558,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
559,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
560,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,(LIONARD DIGGES _is speaking_)
561,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
562,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Yes, so I said: ’twas labored “Cataline”"
563,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Insufferable for learning, tedious."
564,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And so I said: the audience was kept
565,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,There at the Globe twelve years ago to hear:
566,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,“It is no matter; let no images
567,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Be hung with Cæsar’s trophies.”
568,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
569,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And to-day
570,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,They played his Julius Cæsar at the Court.
571,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"I saw it at the Globe twelve years ago,"
572,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A gala day! The flag over the Theatre
573,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Fluttered the April breeze and I was thrilled.
574,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And look what wherries crossed the Thames with freight
575,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of hearts expectant for the theatre.
576,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,For all the town was posted with the news
577,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of Shakespeare’s “Julius Cæsar.” So we paid
578,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Our six-pence, entered, all the house was full."
579,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And dignitaries, favored ones had seats"
580,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Behind the curtain on the stage. At last
581,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The trumpet blares, the curtains part, Marullus"
582,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And Flavius enter, scold the idiot mob"
583,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And we sat ravished, listening to the close."
584,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
585,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"We knew he pondered manuscripts, forever"
586,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Was busy with his work, no rest, no pause."
587,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Often I saw him leave the theatre
588,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And cross the Thames where in a little room
589,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,He opened up his Plutarch. What was that?
590,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A fertilizing sun, a morning light"
591,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of bursting April! What was he? The earth
592,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That under such a sun put forth and grew,"
593,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Showed all his valleys, mountain peaks and fields,"
594,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Brought forth the forests of his cosmic soul,"
595,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The coppice, jungle, blossoms good and bad."
596,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A world of growth, creation! This the work,"
597,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Precedent force of Thomas North, his work"
598,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"In causal link the Bishop of Auxerre,"
599,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And so it goes.
600,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
601,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,But others tried their hand
602,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"At Julius Cæsar, witness “Cæsar’s Fall”"
603,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Which Drayton, Webster, others wrote. And look"
604,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"At Jonson’s “Cataline,” that labored thing,"
605,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Dug out of Plutarch, Cicero. Go read,"
606,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Then read this play of Shakespeare’s.
607,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
608,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,I recall
609,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"What came to me to see this, scene by scene,"
610,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Unroll beneath my eyes. ’Twas like a scroll
611,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Lettered in gold and purple where one theme
612,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"In firmest sequence, precious artistry"
613,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Is charactered, and all the sound and sense,"
614,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And every clause and strophe ministers
615,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To one perfection. So it was we sat
616,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Until the scroll lay open at our feet:
617,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"“According to his virtue, let us use him"
618,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"With all respect and rites of burial,”"
619,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Then gasped for breath! The play’s a miracle!
620,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"This world has had one Cæsar and one Shakespeare,"
621,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And with their birth is shrunk, can only bear"
622,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Less vital spirits.
623,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
624,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,For what did he do
625,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,There in that room with Plutarch? First his mind
626,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Was ready with the very moulds of nature.
627,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And then his spirit blazing like the sun
628,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Smelted the gold from Plutarch, till it flowed"
629,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Molten and dazzling in these moulds of his.
630,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And lo! he sets up figures for our view
631,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That blind the understanding till you close
632,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Eyes to reflect, and by their closing see"
633,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"What has been done. O, well I could go on"
634,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And show how Jonson makes homonculus,"
635,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And Shakespeare gets with child, conceives and bears"
636,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Beauty of flesh and blood. Or I could say
637,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Jonson lays scholar’s hands upon a trait,"
638,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Ambition, let us say, as if a man"
639,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Were peak and nothing else thrust to the sky
640,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"By blasting fires of earth, just peak alone,"
641,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"No slopes, no valleys, pines, or sunny brooks,"
642,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"No rivers winding at the base, no fields,"
643,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"No songsters, foxes, nothing but the peak."
644,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"But Shakespeare shows the field-mice and the cricket,"
645,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The louse upon the leaf, all things that live"
646,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,In every mountain which his soaring light
647,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Takes cognizance; by which I mean to say
648,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Shows not ambition only, that’s the peak,"
649,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"But mice-moods, cricket passions in the man;"
650,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"How he can sing, or whine, or growl, or hiss,"
651,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Be bird, fox, wolf, be eagle or be snake."
652,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And so this “Julius Cæsar” paints the mob
653,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That stinks and howls, a woman in complaint"
654,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Most feminine shut from her husband’s secrets;
655,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Paints envy, paints the demagogue, in brief,"
656,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Paints Cæsar till we lose respect for Cæsar.
657,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"For there he stands in verity, it seems,"
658,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A tyrant, coward, braggart, aging man,"
659,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A stale voluptuary shoved about
660,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And stabbed most righteously by patriots
661,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To avenge the fall of Rome!
662,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
663,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Now I have said
664,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Enough to give me warrant to say this:
665,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"This play of Shakespeare fails, is an abuse"
666,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Upon the memory of the greatest man
667,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That ever trod this earth. And Shakespeare failed
668,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,By just so much as he might have achieved
669,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Surpassing triumph had he made the play
670,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Cæsar instead of Brutus, had he shown"
671,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A sovereign will and genius struck to earth
672,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,With loss irreparable to Time and ruin
673,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To Cæsar’s dreams; struck evilly to death
674,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"By a mad enthusiast, a brutal stoic,"
675,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,In whom all gratitude was tricked aside
676,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"By just a word, the word of Liberty."
677,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Or might I also say the man had envy
678,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of Cæsar’s greatness, or might it be true"
679,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Brutus took edge for hatred with the thought
680,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That Brutus’ sister flamed with love for Cæsar?
681,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"But who was Brutus, by the largest word"
682,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That comes to us that he should be exalted,"
683,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Forefronted in this play, and warrant given"
684,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To madmen down the ages to repeat
685,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"This act of Brutus’, con the golden words"
686,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of Shakespeare as he puts them in his mouth:
687,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"“Not that I loved him less, but loved Rome more."
688,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,He was ambitious so I slew him. Tears
689,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"For his love, joy for his fortune, honor for valor,"
690,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Death for ambition. Would you die all slaves
691,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That Cæsar might still live, or live free men"
692,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,With Cæsar dead?”
693,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
694,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And so it is the echo
695,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of Cæsar’s fall is cried to by this voice
696,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of Shakespeare’s and increased, to travel forth,"
697,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To fool the ages and to madden men
698,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,With thunder in the hills of time to deeds
699,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,As horrible as this.
700,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
701,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Did Shakespeare know
702,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The worth of Cæsar, that we may impute"
703,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Fault for this cartoon--caricature? Why look,"
704,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Did he not write the “mightiest Julius,” write"
705,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"“The foremost man of all the world,” “the conqueror"
706,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Whom death could conquer not,” make Cleopatra,"
707,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The pearl of all the east, say she was glad"
708,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That Cæsar wore her on his hand? He knew
709,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,What Cæsar’s greatness was! Yet what have we?
710,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A Cæsar with the falling sickness, deaf,"
711,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Who faints upon the offering of the crown;
712,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Who envies Cassius stronger arms in swimming,"
713,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"When it is known that Cæsar swam the Tiber,"
714,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Being more than fifty; pompous, superstitious,"
715,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Boasting his will, but flagging in the act;"
716,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Greedy of praise, incautious, unalert"
717,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To dangers seen of all; a lust incarnate
718,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of power and rulership; a Cæsar smashing
719,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A great republic like a criminal,"
720,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A republic which had lived except for him.
721,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
722,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,So what was Rome when Cæsar took control?
723,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,All wealth and power concentered in the few;
724,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A coterie of the rich who lived in splendor;
725,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A working class that lived on doles of corn
726,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And hordes of slaves from Asia, Africa,"
727,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Who plotted murders in the dark purlieus;
728,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,The provinces were drained to feed the rich;
729,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The city ruled by bribery, and corruption;"
730,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Armed gladiators sold their services.
731,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And battled in the Forum; magistrates
732,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Were freely scoffed at, consuls were attacked;"
733,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And orators spat in each other’s faces
734,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,When reason failed them speaking in the Forum;
735,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,No man of prominence went on the streets
736,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Without his hired gladiators, slaves."
737,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The streets were unpoliced, no fire brigade,"
738,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Safe-guarded property. Domestic life
739,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Was rotten at the heart, and vice was taught."
740,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Divorce was rife and even holy Cato
741,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Put by his wife.
742,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
743,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And this was the republic
744,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That Cæsar took; and not the lovely state
745,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Ordered and prospered, which ambitious Cæsar,"
746,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"As Shakespeare paints him, over-whelmed. For Cæsar"
747,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Could execute the vision that the people
748,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Deserve not what they want, but otherwise"
749,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"What they should want, and in that mind was king"
750,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And emperor.
751,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
752,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And what was here for Shakespeare
753,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"To love and manifest by art, who hated"
754,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The Puritan, the mob? Colossus Cæsar,"
755,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Whose harmony of mind took deep offense
756,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"At ugliness, disharmony! See the man:"
757,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of body perfect and of rugged health,"
758,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of graceful carriage, fashion, bold of eye,"
759,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A swordsman, horseman, and a general"
760,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Not less than Alexander; orator
761,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Who rivalled Cicero, a man of charm,"
762,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of wit and humor, versed in books as well;"
763,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Who at one time could dictate, read and write,"
764,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Composing grammars as he rode to war,"
765,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Amid distractions, dangers, battles, writing"
766,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Great commentaries. Yes, he is the man"
767,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,In whom was mixed the elements that Nature
768,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Might say:--this was a man--and not this Brutus.
769,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
770,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Look at his camp, wherever pitched in Gaul,"
771,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Thronged by young poets, thinkers, scholars, wits,"
772,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And headed by this Cæsar, who when arms"
773,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Are resting from the battle, makes reports"
774,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of all that’s said and done to Cicero.
775,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Here is a man large minded and sincere,"
776,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Active, a lover, conscious of his place,"
777,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Knowing his power, no reverence for the past,"
778,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Save what the past deserved, who made the task"
779,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,What could be done and did it--seized the power
780,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of rulership and did not put it by
781,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,As Shakespeare clothes him with pretence of doing.
782,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,For what was kingship to him? empty name!
783,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"He who had mastered Asia, Africa,"
784,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Egypt, Hispania, after twenty years"
785,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of cyclic dreams and labor--king indeed!
786,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A name! when sovereign power was nothing new.
787,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"He’s fifty-six, and knows the human breed,"
788,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Sees man as body hiding a canal
789,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"For passing food along, a little brain"
790,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That watches, loves, attends the said canal."
791,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,He’s been imperator at least two years--
792,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"King in good sooth! He knows he is not valued,"
793,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That he’s misprized and hated, is compelled"
794,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"To use whom he distrusts, despises too."
795,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Why, what was life to him with such contempt"
796,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of all this dirty world, this eagle set"
797,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Amid a flock of vultures, cow-birds, bats?"
798,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"His ladder was not lowliness, but genius."
799,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Read of his capture in Bithynia,"
800,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,When he was just a stripling by Cilician
801,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Pirates whom he treated like his slaves,"
802,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And told them to their face when he was ransomed
803,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"He’d have them crucified. He did it, too."
804,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"His ransom came at last, he was released,"
805,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And set to work at once to keep his word;
806,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Fitted some ships out, captured every one"
807,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And crucified them all at Pergamos.
808,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Not lowliness his ladder, but the strength"
809,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That steps on shoulders, fit for steps alone."
810,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,So on this top-most rung he did not scan
811,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The base degrees by which he did ascend,"
812,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,But sickened rather at a world whose heights
813,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Are not worth reaching. So it was he went
814,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Unarmed and unprotected to the Senate,"
815,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Knowing that death is noble, being nature,"
816,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And scorning fear. Why, he had lived enough."
817,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The night before he dined with Lepidus,"
818,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"To whom he said the death that is not seen,"
819,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Is not expected, is the best. But look,"
820,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Here in this play he’s shown a weak old man,"
821,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Propped up with stays and royal robes, to amble,"
822,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Trembling and babbling to his coronation;
823,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And to the going, driven by the fear"
824,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That he would be thought coward if he failed.
825,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Who was to think so? Cassius, whom he cowed,"
826,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And whipped against strong odds, this Brutus, too,"
827,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"There at Pharsalus! Faith, I’d like to know"
828,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,What Francis Bacon thinks of this.
829,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
830,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"My friend,"
831,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Seeing the Rome that Cæsar took, we turn"
832,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To what he did with what he took. This Rome
833,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,At Cæsar’s birth was governed by the people
834,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"In name alone, in fact the Senate ruled,"
835,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And money ruled the Senate. Rank and file
836,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Was made of peasants, tradesmen, manumitted"
837,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Slaves and soldiers--these the populares,"
838,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Who made our Cæsar’s uncle Marius
839,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Chief magistrate six times. This was the party
840,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That Cæsar joined and wrought for to the last.
841,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,He fought the aristocracy all his life.
842,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,His heart was democratic and his head
843,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Patrician--was ambitious from the first,"
844,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"As Shakespeare is ambitious, gifted by"
845,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The Muses, must work out his vision or"
846,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Rot down with gifts neglected; so this Cæsar
847,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Gifted to rule must rule--but what’s the dream?
848,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"To use his power for democratic weal,"
849,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Bring order, justice in a rotten state,"
850,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And carry on the work of Marius,"
851,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"His democratic uncle. Now behold,"
852,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,He’s fifty when he reaches sovereign power;
853,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Few years are left in which he may achieve
854,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"His democratic ideas, for he sought"
855,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"No gain in power, but chance to do his work,"
856,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Fulfill his genius. Well, he takes the Senate"
857,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And breaks its aristocracy, then frees"
858,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,The groaning debtors; reduces the congestion
859,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Of stifled Italy, founds colonies,"
860,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Helps agriculture, executes the laws."
861,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Crime skulks before him, luxury he checks."
862,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The franchise is enlarged, he codifies"
863,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The Roman laws, and founds a money system;"
864,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Collects a library, and takes a census;"
865,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Reforms the calendar, and thus bestrode"
866,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,The world with work accomplished. Round his legs
867,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"All other men must peer; and envy, hatred"
868,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Were serpents at his heels, whose poison reached"
869,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"His heart at last. He was the tower of Pharos,"
870,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,That lighted all the world.
871,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
872,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Now who was Brutus?
873,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Cæsar forgave this Brutus seven times seven,"
874,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Forgave him for Pharsalia, all his acts"
875,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of constant opposition. Who was Brutus?
876,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A simple, honest soul? A heart of hate,"
877,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Bred by his uncle Cato! Was he gentle?
878,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Look what he did to Salamis! Besieged
879,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Its senate house and starved the senators
880,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To force compliance with a loan to them
881,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,At 48 per cent! This is the man
882,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Whom Shakespeare makes to say he’d rather be
883,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A villager than to report himself
884,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A son of Rome under these hard conditions,"
885,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Which Cæsar wrought! Who thought or called them hard?
886,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Brutus or Shakespeare? Is it Plutarch, maybe,"
887,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Whom Shakespeare follows, all against the grain"
888,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of truth so long revealed?
889,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Do you not see
890,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Matter in plenty for our Shakespeare’s hand,"
891,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,To show a sovereign genius and its work
892,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Pursued by mad-dogs, bitten to its death,"
893,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Its plans thrown into chaos? Is there clay
894,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Wherewith to mould the face of Cæsar; take
895,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,What clay remains to mould the face of Brutus?
896,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Do you not see a straining of the stuff,"
897,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Making that big and salient which should be
898,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Little and hidden in a group of figures?
899,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"And why, I ask? Here is the irony:"
900,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Shakespeare has minted Plutarch, stamped the coin"
901,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"With the face of Brutus. It’s his inner genius,"
902,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,The very flavor of his genius’ flesh
903,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"To do this thing. Here is a world that’s mad,"
904,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A Cæsar mad with power, a Brutus madder,"
905,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Being a dreamer, student, patriot"
906,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Who can’t see things as clearly as the madman
907,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Cæsar sees them, Brutus sees through books."
908,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,A mad-man butchered by a man more mad.
909,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"His father mad before him. Why, it’s true"
910,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"That every one is mad, because the world"
911,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Cannot be solved. Why are we here and why
912,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,This agony of being? Why these tasks
913,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Imposed upon us never done, which drive"
914,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Our souls to desperation. So to print
915,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The tragedy of life, our Shakespeare takes,"
916,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And by the taking shows he deems the theme
917,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Greater than Cæsar’s greatness: human will,"
918,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A dream, a hope, a love, and makes them big."
919,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Strains all the clay to that around a form
920,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Too weak to hold the moulded stuff in place.
921,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Thus from his genius fashioning the tales
922,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Of human life he passes judgment on
923,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,The mystery of life. Which could he do
924,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"By making Cæsar great, and would it be"
925,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"So bitter and so hopeless if he did,"
926,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,So adequate to curse this life of ours?
927,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,Why make a man as great as Nature can
928,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The gods will raise a manakin to kill him,"
929,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And over-turn the order that he founds.
930,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"A grape seed strangles Sophocles, a turtle"
931,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Falls from an eagle’s claws on Aeschylos,"
932,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And cracks his shiny pate.
933,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
934,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,So at the last
935,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"The question is, is history the truth,"
936,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Or is the Shakespeare genius, which arranges"
937,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"History to speak the Shakespeare mood,"
938,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,"Reaction to our life, the truth?"
939,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,
940,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And here
941,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,I leave you to reflect. Let’s one more ale
942,AT THE MERMAID TAVERN,And then I go.

1198,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,FOUQUER-TINVILLE
1199,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1200,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Let’s see now what’s her mind.
1201,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,This letter to the friends of peace and laws:--
1202,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"“O France, thy peace depends upon the laws.”"
1203,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Laws! And she hastens to the cutler’s shop,"
1204,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And buys a knife with which to slay Marat.
1205,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Now look! This friend of France’s peace and laws
1206,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Must dodge self-contradiction. How? That’s plain:
1207,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"“I do not break the law, killing Marat.”"
1208,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Why? What’s Marat? A man? Of course, a man."
1209,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"But then an “out-law,” as she writes. How’s that?"
1210,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Outlawed by whom? Charlotte Corday of Caen!
1211,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,What else? A man! But then condemned. By whom?
1212,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,“The universe.” Voila! The universe
1213,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Is swallowed by her swollen vanity.
1214,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She speaks for God, for solar systems, stars;"
1215,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Adjudges laws, interprets, executes;"
1216,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Is greater than the Revolution, France."
1217,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,She’s a descendant of the great Corneille;
1218,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"A stage imagination, actress, acts,"
1219,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And quotes here in this letter from Voltaire’s
1220,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,“Mort de César.” Now listen what her hate
1221,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Has used for whetrock, in the words of Brutus:"
1222,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,_“Whether the world astonished loads my name_
1223,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"_“And deed with horror, admiration, censure,_"
1224,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"_“I do not care, nor care to live in Time._"
1225,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"_“I act indifferent to reproach or glory,_"
1226,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"_“A free, untrameled patriot am I._"
1227,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,_“Duty accomplished I shall rest content._
1228,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"_“Think only, friends, how you may break your chains.”_"
1229,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,So Brutus lives in her! And like disease
1230,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Loosed from the crumbling cerements and dust
1231,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of broken tombs, the madness which slew Cæsar"
1232,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Infects, makes mad this woman; and she slays"
1233,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,The great Marat!
1234,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,She does not care for the world’s
1235,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Censure or admiration! Does not care
1236,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"To live in time! She lies! Why, in this room"
1237,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"A man, Huer, is sketching her. Behold"
1238,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,He’s drawing now her face for Time to see.
1239,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And in this letter written to the Committee
1240,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She says: “_Since I have little time to live,_"
1241,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,“_I trust you will permit me to have painted_
1242,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,“_My portrait._” Why? If careless if she live
1243,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"In memory or time? The secret’s out,"
1244,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And written in her hand: “_I want to leave_
1245,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,“_A picture for remembrance to my friends._”
1246,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"What friends? Her father? Barbarous? Caen,"
1247,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Paris, the whole of France, the world, if Time"
1248,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Writes down the people’s friend as beast, would see"

1250,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Condemned first by the “universe” and at last
1251,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"By France, the world! What next? She doubts her God,"
1252,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Her Brutus warrant, “universe” approval,"
1253,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And writes here as a reason, in addition:"
1254,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"_“That as men cherish memory of good men,_"

1257,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,_“So curiosity sometimes seeks out_

1279,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,This is not all
1280,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"About her picture, a memorial"
1281,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,For admiration by posterity.
1282,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She writes this Barbarous, lover or what,"
1283,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"It matters nothing, writes him pages here"
1284,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"In detail of herself, and intimate"
1285,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Portrayal of her feelings: how she planned,"
1286,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And killed Marat. To Barbarous she writes
1287,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"About her letter to the Committee, asking"
1288,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"To have her portrait painted. _Now_, for whom?"
1289,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Her friends? Not now! For the department now
1290,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of Calvados. There! hanging on a wall,"
1291,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"A prize of history, is the deathless face"
1292,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of Charlotte Corday, destroyer of Marat,"
1293,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Saviour of France, as _Brutus struck for Rome_!"
1294,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Yes, I invite your thought to what she writes"
1295,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,To Barbarous: description of her act
1296,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,In sneaking to Marat with hidden knife;
1297,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And as he sat there helpless in the tub,"
1298,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And unsuspecting of her hatred, quick"
1299,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She rips him like a butcher. Then, “A moi!”"
1300,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"He cries, “A moi!” And she’s elate, her eyes"
1301,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Bright as the lightning that has struck. Look now!
1302,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"How she writhes here, how passing cross her face"
1303,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Are lights of ghastly fields of fire and clouds

1311,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1312,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"I am a beast, eh? _You_ are what? I’ll tell."
1313,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"From Caen, as ’tis known. She’s being sketched,"
1314,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"I’ll sketch her too. You see, she’s strongly built,"
1315,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Large eyes of blue, large features, handsome though;"
1316,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Nose shapely, and good teeth; equipped to play"
1317,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"In dramas of Corneille, her ancestor."
1318,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,She needs a man. A husband would have drawn
1319,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Innocuously the electric passion, which"
1320,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Collected in a bolt to loose and lurch
1321,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Against Marat. All women should be farmed.
1322,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She has her schooling in a convent, reads;"
1323,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Lives with her thoughts and dreams. I’ll sketch her soul:
1324,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Has not enough of living to consume
1325,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"The forces of her dreams. She reads Rousseau,"
1326,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And Plutarch’s heroes, Brutus most of all."
1327,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Thrills at the words “Republic,” “Liberty.”"
1328,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Thinks the Girondists only can set up
1329,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,A real republic. Ideas are the stuff
1330,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Of history. Kill ideas or be killed
1331,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"By ideas is the fate of man. Republic,"
1332,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Liberty, Brutus are ideas. Ideas"
1333,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Are dangerous, being truths, more so as lies."
1334,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And lies destroyed Marat.
1335,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1336,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Who was Marat?
1337,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"A man of study, learning. Physicist,"
1338,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Admired of Franklin, Göethe for his works"
1339,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"On heat and light; a doctor, having won"
1340,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,An honorary title at St. Andrew’s
1341,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"In England. Linguist, speaking Spanish, German,"
1342,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Italian, English. Versed in Governments:--"
1343,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,You know his work on England’s constitution
1344,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Whereby he sought to clear the mind of France--
1345,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,This Charlotte Corday’s with the rest--that England
1346,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Is free, her systems free; stop the Girondists"
1347,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,From that re-iterated lie; stop France
1348,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,From taking on the English system.
1349,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1350,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,So
1351,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"True ideas of Marat, evolved from life,"
1352,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Living and study must combat, destroy"
1353,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"False ideas of Girondists, will succeed;"
1354,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,But cannot bar the door to the idea
1355,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,That enters at his bathroom with a knife.
1356,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,How was it that no valet and no guard
1357,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Preserved him? Why? Lovers of liberty
1358,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Starve in her service!
1359,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1360,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,But there was a time
1361,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,When he knew elegance and privacy.
1362,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,But Liberty and Wisdom would be served.
1363,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"He went to rags, was hunted, had to hide"
1364,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,In sewers for the cause of Liberty;
1365,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And there took loathsome trouble, eased at times"
1366,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"By steam, hot tubs. And thus our people’s friend"
1367,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Is found accessible to this female lie,"
1368,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Girondist lie, possessing her, and stabbed."
1369,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Or at the best ideas of Liberty
1370,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Conduct her to his bath-room, where Marat"
1371,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Is tubbed in sequence and in punishment
1372,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of his idea of Liberty. Gods can laugh,"
1373,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"But men must weep. O worthless, rotten world!"
1374,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"It is most pitiful, most tragic, lifts"
1375,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Man’s heart to spit at heaven, that these friends"
1376,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of peoples must be slain, starved, hunted first,"
1377,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Then butchered for their service and their love.
1378,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Saved not by truth; destroyed by lies, a lie"
1379,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"That he was evil, by the maniac lie"
1380,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of her mad vision that she knew what Freedom,"
1381,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Liberty, Republic mean. Slain by the lie"
1382,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of this Girondist dream, this milk and water,"
1383,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Emasculated, luke-warm craft of states:"
1384,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Girondists: patches on the robes of kings;
1385,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Girondists: autogamists; mating sisters,"
1386,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"The past, and in the mating without child"
1387,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of truth or progress. Neither hot nor cold,"
1388,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Spewed, therefore, from the mouth of Time. Betrayers,"
1389,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Waylayers of the brave, the clear of eye;"
1390,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Girondists: ’twixt republicans and kings,"
1391,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And holding hands of each to make them friends.
1392,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Workers and owners of the new foaled mule
1393,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Bred of the royal stallion and an ass.
1394,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Girondists! loving wealth and ease, the church"
1395,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Which loves them too. Girondists picking steps
1396,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Of moderate reform. Girondists hating
1397,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"The Revolution, which must kill the foes"
1398,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of Liberty, as criminals are killed"
1399,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"For robbery, yet rejoice to see the blood"
1400,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Of dead Marat. They’re lofty! They are pure!
1401,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"They love the laws, love peace! Yes, as this woman"
1402,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Loves law and peace.
1403,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1404,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,What is it like? A play
1405,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Where all is mimicked. Do we talk of facts?
1406,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Are these not fautocinni? Where’s the hand
1407,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,That plays this coarse and bloody joke to eyes
1408,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Of men that crave reality? I mean this:
1409,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"A woman with lovers who suggest, abet;"
1410,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"A woman with no man, who dreams and reads,"
1411,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Lives in the stench of these Girondist lies;
1412,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Ghosts float on fogs of her miasmic soul.
1413,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She hears Marat’s a monster, dabbling blood,"
1414,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,A rabid ignoramus running foul
1415,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of liberty and order, nihilist,"
1416,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And sanguinary madman, dragon slimed"
1417,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"In back-wash of all hatred, envy, lust"
1418,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of the dispossessed, malformed, misborn; and then"
1419,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"She dreams of Brutus, who struck down--there now"
1420,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,I nail a lie that will be always truth
1421,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,To Charlotte Cordays. Cæsar? Tyrant? No.
1422,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,No man is tyrant who sees truth and rules
1423,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,For truth’s sake. For the ruled must share the truth
1424,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Where Cæsars rule.
1425,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1426,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,So much for her. She stands
1427,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Watchful and envious in the wings, and sees"
1428,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Marat, not as we see him; not as Time"
1429,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Will see Marat. L’Ami du Peuple to her
1430,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Is enemy of France, of Liberty."
1431,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"This man most rare, most pure of soul, most clear"
1432,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Of vision that the contest lies between
1433,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"The rich and poor, has always lain between"
1434,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"The rich and poor, and not between the people"
1435,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"And kings; that poverty’s the thing, is seen"
1436,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"By Charlotte Corday from the wings, as nothing"
1437,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"But hatred, murder."
1438,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1439,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Well, my girl, you’ll get"
1440,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Your picture in the galleries of history.
1441,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,You’ll get it; and to choke you with your words:
1442,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,“So curiosity would have memorials
1443,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Of criminals, which serve to keep alive"
1444,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Horror for their crimes.”
1445,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,
1446,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Your picture’s up
1447,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,Already. Horror stares! You killed Marat.
1448,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,That is your place in Time: you killed Marat!
1449,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"You sneaked upon a great man, true man, weak"
1450,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"From torture of disease, contracted serving"
1451,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Democracy, and slew him like a beast."
1452,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,"Charlotte Corday, assassin! That’s your place,"
1453,FOUQUER-TINVILLE,And character in history.

1468,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,Your clemency? The girl’s fanatical.
1469,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,The prosecutor argues well for me
1470,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"In saying that a lie corrupted her,"
1471,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,And maddened her to act; which is to say
1472,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"If that lie were a truth, she had the right"
1473,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"To slay Marat. With this regard Voltaire,"
1474,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Great minds before him, painted Brutus great"
1475,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,Because he slew a tyrant. But if Cæsar
1476,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Was not a tyrant, how does Brutus stand"
1477,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"But mad-man who believed, was honest, slew"
1478,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,In honesty of heart? Then what’s the case?
1479,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"To punish for ill-judging of the facts,"
1480,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,Or mercy show for human frailty
1481,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,Of judgment and of vision? Great Marat
1482,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Has done his work, and left his legacy."
1483,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"We cannot help him, meting death for death."
1484,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,And would his noble spirit ask her death?
1485,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Think of it! You will answer no, I think."
1486,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"He would say: kill the ideas of Caen,"
1487,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,The world which fires these Charlottes with a lie.
1488,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Smallpox is deadly as a butcher knife,"
1489,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,He had to die. The syllabus is death
1490,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,In this our human logic: what’s the odds
1491,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"What premises produce conclusions? Knives,"
1492,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Consumptions, fevers, wars? We may be gods"
1493,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,Withholding death where we have power to kill;
1494,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Withhold it saying: She mistook, believed"
1495,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"A lie, was faultless for believing it,"
1496,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,And slew believing. Were it truth and all
1497,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Believed we would applaud, as nations war,"
1498,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,Bound in a common vision of one truth.
1499,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"The Revolution, France, will lose not, rather"
1500,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Gain by this clemency; ’twill lift a light,"
1501,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"First in the world, of reason, justice purged"
1502,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Of hatred’s refuse: vengeance, fear, all passions"
1503,CHAVEAU-LAGARDE,"Of bitterness of soul. We worship Reason,"

1603,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And just to think I named you Junius Brutus,"
1604,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,After the great republican who slew
1605,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,The Roman tyrant Cæsar--I myself
1606,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"A worshipper of Liberty all my life,"
1607,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,And choosing such a patronym for you
1608,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,To dedicate you to the faith in me.
1609,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Now you would leave this dignity to speak
1610,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Mimetic words, and act. I beg of you,"
1611,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Listen, my boy, before it is too late,"
1612,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And let me tell my story to you now,"
1613,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,That you may profit by the things I’ve lived....
1614,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,
1615,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"You see that face of Washington, hung up"
1616,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,There on the wall where every entering eye
1617,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Must mark it? You remember that I ask,"
1618,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Enforce respect to Washington and make
1619,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"The passer bow his head--well, listen now:"
1620,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,
1621,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"It’s seventeen seventy-seven, I’m fourteen."
1622,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Burgoyne’s surrender fires my tender heart.
1623,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,We hear Lord George Germain forgets to take
1624,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,A letter from a pigeon hole containing
1625,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Instructions to Burgoyne that touches on
1626,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"The campaign on the Hudson. Anyway,"
1627,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Burgoyne gets tangled in the wilderness
1628,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Around Champlain. He faces broken bridges,"
1629,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And trees felled in his way. His horses fail,"
1630,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Provisions are exhausted. Then he sends
1631,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,A thousand men to Bennington to get
1632,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,More horses and provisions. There he’s stumped:
1633,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"A veteran of Bunker Hill is there,"
1634,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"A Colonel Stark, whose wife is Mollie Stark,"
1635,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Who says we beat the British here to-day,"
1636,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Or Mollie Stark’s a widow. August 16th
1637,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,They whipped the British soundly--and Burgoyne
1638,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Was driven to defeat.
1639,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,
1640,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,That made us flame!
1641,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,I was a hot republican. Slipped away
1642,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,To Paris with a cousin to set sail
1643,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"For America and help the Americans,"
1644,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And wrote from there a letter to John Wilkes,"
1645,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,And asked his help to get me in the army
1646,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Of Washington. As Englishmen, I wrote,"
1647,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,It may be said we are not justified
1648,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,In taking arms against the English cause.
1649,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"That argument with you could have no weight,"
1650,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"You, who have fought for Liberty so long."
1651,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And England, what is she? All human rights"
1652,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Are lost in England under tyrant rule.
1653,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,It is the duty of an English heart
1654,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,To help those whom this lawless tyranny
1655,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Oppresses in America. So I wrote,"
1656,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,And sent to London. What do you suppose?
1657,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,John Wilkes went to my father with this letter.
1658,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"They caught me, brought me home, and here I am,"
1659,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,A lawyer to this day. You think it strange!
1660,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Who was John Wilkes, that he should thus betray?--"
1661,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"I wonder, even now."
1662,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,
1663,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,For he had been
1664,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"A rebel spirit from his boyhood up,"
1665,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Born here in London seventeen twenty-seven;
1666,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Was sent to Parliament when he was thirty.
1667,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Attacked the king in writing, was arrested;"
1668,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Refused to answer questions, then they chucked"
1669,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Our rebel in the Tower; he got out,"
1670,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Saying he had a privilege as a member
1671,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Of Parliament. They passed a special law
1672,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"To warrant prosecution, ousted him"
1673,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"From Parliament, and then he went to France,"
1674,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Was outlawed, but returned, again was sent"
1675,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"To Parliament, before he took his seat."
1676,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Was sent to prison on the sentences
1677,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Passed on the old conviction, and expelled"
1678,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,From Parliament again for libeling
1679,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,The minister of war. Three times again
1680,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"They elected him to Parliament, but they kept"
1681,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Our rebel out. He now became the people’s
1682,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Idol for his sufferings and his courage.
1683,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"They let him out of prison, made him mayor"
1684,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Of London, and in seventeen seventy-four"
1685,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,He goes from Middlesex to Parliament
1686,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And takes his seat at last, and there he was"
1687,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"When I wrote to him, seventeen seventy-seven."
1688,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Why did he tell my father, send my father"
1689,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,The letter which I wrote?
1690,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,
1691,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"I know, I think:"
1692,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"He knew the dangers, agonies ahead,"
1693,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,For a boy who sets his feet along the path
1694,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Of Liberty and working for the world
1695,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,To free the world--and did not know my stuff;
1696,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,Whether I had the will to fight and die
1697,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"With no regrets. He knew what he had suffered,"
1698,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,And had a tenderness for the youth who flames
1699,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And beats his wings for freedom, would release"
1700,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,From tyranny and wrong.
1701,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,
1702,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And so they caught me,"
1703,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,And brought me home and set me to the law.
1704,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And here I am, who never lost the dream"
1705,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And named you Junius Brutus. Oh, my son,"
1706,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Leave off this actor calling, stay with me,"
1707,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"I who was nipped would see you grow to flower,"
1708,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Fulfill my vision. What, you promise me,"
1709,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"If I will let you act this time, to come"
1710,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"And let me mould you, teach you what I know,"
1711,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"Fill full your spirit with the hope I had,"
1712,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,That you may do what I have failed to do?
1713,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,"You promise that? Well, Junius Brutus, go"
1714,RICHARD BOOTH TO HIS SON JUNIUS BRUTUS,And may you fail at acting and return.

1752,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1753,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1754,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,You missed it--case all over! Lincoln’s gone.
1755,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,He’s just had time about to reach the mill.
1756,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,He couldn’t wait until the stage arrived.
1757,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Had business in the courts of Springfield--well,"
1758,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,You can believe he has become a lawyer.
1759,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,He borrowed Mentor Graham’s horse to ride.
1760,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,John Yoakum is in Springfield and to-morrow
1761,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Will bring it back.
1762,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1763,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Who won the case? Why, Abe."
1764,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,He won it by his horse-sense and his wit.
1765,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,You must have met the jury down the road.
1766,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,What were they laughing at? About the case.
1767,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,We started yesterday on the evidence
1768,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And finished up this morning. An appeal?
1769,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"The verdict satisfies both parties, and"
1770,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,My judgment stands.
1771,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1772,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Abe is a natural lawyer,"
1773,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Knows things that can’t be found in books, although"
1774,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,He knows the books. And why not? You recall
1775,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,When he was boarding with me how he studied?
1776,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"It’s just four years ago or so, that he"
1777,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Came home one night with Blackstone. Well, I’ve noticed"
1778,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"A man attracts what’s his, just like a magnet"
1779,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Draws bits of steel. You can’t make me believe
1780,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,That Blackstone came to him unless ’twas meant
1781,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,That he should be a lawyer. Don’t you know?
1782,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,He read this Blackstone in his store all day
1783,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And half the night as well. He said to me
1784,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Not Volney’s “Ruins,” Shakespeare, Burns, had taken"
1785,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"His interest like this Blackstone. Yes, he took it"
1786,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"When he went fishing with Jack Kelso, read,"
1787,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And let jack row the boat and bait the hooks....
1788,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1789,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,I think he knows this Blackstone all by heart.
1790,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"But anyway, he knows the human heart."
1791,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Well, now here is the case: Here is a colt."
1792,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,George Cameron says the colt is his--John Spears
1793,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Says no, the colt is mine, and Cameron sues,"
1794,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And Spears defends, and sixty witnesses"
1795,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Come here to testify, on my word it’s true,"
1796,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,On my judicial oath it is the fact.
1797,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,The thirty swear the colt is Cameron’s;
1798,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And thirty swear the colt belongs to Spears;
1799,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And not a man impeached, these witnesses"
1800,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Are everyone good men, and most of them"
1801,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"I know as I know you. Well, what’s to do?"
1802,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"The scales are balanced. And besides all this,"
1803,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Here’s Cameron who swears the colt is his,"
1804,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And Spears who swears the opposite, and both"
1805,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Are credible, I know them both. So I"
1806,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Sit like a fellow trying to decide
1807,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,What happens when a thing impenetrable
1808,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Is struck by something irresistible--
1809,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"I’m stumped, that’s all."
1810,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1811,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,You see the facts were these:
1812,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Each of these fellows owns a mare, the mares"
1813,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Look pretty much alike, each had a colt"
1814,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,In April. But the other day one colt--
1815,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Which colt, that is the question--strayed away"
1816,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And can’t be found. George Cameron has a colt--
1817,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,These men are neighbors--but John Spears comes over
1818,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And sees the colt at Cameron’s in the field;
1819,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And says, “That is my colt.” “Not on your life,”"
1820,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"George Cameron replies, “The colt is mine--"
1821,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Your colt has strayed, not mine.” They come to law."
1822,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"John Spears gets Lincoln, and they come to court"
1823,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,With sixty witnesses; and here this noon
1824,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"With all the evidence put in, I sit"
1825,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And eye the jury, know the jury’s stumped,"
1826,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,As I am stumped.
1827,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1828,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Then Lincoln says: “Your honor,"
1829,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Let’s have a trial on view.” I’d heard of that,"
1830,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,But never sat on such a trial before.
1831,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"“Let’s bring the colt, the two mares over here,"
1832,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And let the jury see which mare the colt
1833,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Resembles, let the jury use their eyes"
1834,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,As witnesses use theirs.”
1835,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1836,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,That seemed fair.
1837,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And so we sent one fellow for the mares,"
1838,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Another for the colt. For Lincoln said:
1839,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"“Your honor, bring them separate, so the jury"
1840,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Can have the sudden flash of seeing them
1841,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Separate, to study them.”"
1842,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1843,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,For an hour
1844,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Abe sat here in the shade and told us stories.
1845,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And pretty soon we heard the horses whinney,"
1846,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And heard the colt. And Lincoln said, “Your honor,"
1847,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Let’s have the mares led past the jury, trotting,"
1848,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Let’s see their pace.” And so they trotted them.
1849,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"“Now trot the colt,” said Lincoln--we did that."
1850,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"The jury watched to see the look of legs,"
1851,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And movement, if you please, to catch a likeness."
1852,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,But nothing came of this. Then Lincoln said:
1853,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,“Now turn the colt loose”--and they turned it loose.
1854,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,It galloped to the mare of Spears and sucked!
1855,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Well, now it’s true a colt’s a silly thing,"
1856,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And may mistake its mother, but a mare"
1857,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Will never let a colt that’s not her own
1858,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Put under flanks its nose. Of course the jury,"
1859,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,And all of us know that--and so did Abe.
1860,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,The jury yelled and all the witnesses
1861,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,Began to whoop. And when I rapped for order
1862,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"And got things quiet--Lincoln rose and said,"
1863,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"“I rest, your honor.”"
1864,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1865,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,So I entered judgment
1866,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,For Spears. They went to Berry’s for the drinks--
1867,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,There! hear them laughing.
1868,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,
1869,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Lincoln took his fee,"
1870,SQUIRE BOWLING GREEN,"Ten dollars, I believe, and went to Springfield."

1923,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"I said to him. “O yes, you can,” he said."
1924,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"“You must recite for me.” And I was scared,"
1925,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"Began to cry, and he said, “Hush, my boy,"
1926,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"I will not hurt you, but you must recite,"
1927,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,I want to see what you have memorized.”
1928,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"So I was choking, but I tried to do it:"
1929,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"“The tyrannous and bloody deed is done,"
1930,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,The most arch act of piteous massacre
1931,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,That ever yet this land was guilty of.” ...
1932,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,
1933,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"“No Richard III,” he said. “Here look at me!"
1934,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,Why do you dodge? Why not recite some words
1935,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"From Brutus, for you know them, why, my boy?"
1936,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,You’ve heard your father speak the words of Brutus.
1937,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,Why do you hide your knowledge? Look at me!”
1938,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,He terrified me so that I began:
1939,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,“It must be by his death: and for my part
1940,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"I know no personal cause to spurn at him,"
1941,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,But for the general. He would be crowned:
1942,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"How that might change his nature, there’s the question."
1943,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,It is the bright day that brings forth the adder.”
1944,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"I got so far and saw him looking down,"
1945,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,As if he saw--I don’t know what--and then
1946,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,I stopped and looked--and there I saw an adder
1947,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,Coiled close to me. I jumped and screamed. He laughed--
1948,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"I ran away, and left him standing there."
1949,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,"Mother, I am afraid. Who was this man?"
1950,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,My head hurts. I’m afraid. Keep close to me--
1951,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,I am so frightened.
1952,JOHN WILKES BOOTH AT THE FARM,

2007,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,The fateful note that thrills--all other hours
2008,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,Are spent in saving power and making ready

2010,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,A medium round whom the spirits swarm

2022,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"The spirits are a-crying, there you are,"
2023,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Ambitious but enfeebled, can’t respond,"

2041,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,
2042,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"My friend,"
2043,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,Another drink of brandy!
2044,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,

2049,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"I knew Old Hickory and supped with him,"
2050,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"A man from top to toe! And I have lived,"
2051,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Fought, suffered, triumphed, lived through self and lived"
2052,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Through Brutus, Lear, and Richard."
2053,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,
2054,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Look at me,"

2056,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Mad-men have struck at me, a lunatic"
2057,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Struck at me with an ax, I cowed his hate"
2058,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"And fixed him with my eye. But as for me,"
2059,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Here have I been for life a lover of home,"
2060,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"A husband blest with happiness in a wife,"
2061,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,And yet reputed mad. For little things
2062,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Like this reputed mad: I’m playing Shylock,"
2063,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"The call boy searches me, my time has come,"
2064,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,Where was I? In a closet. Was it queer?
2065,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,A symptom? No! I hid to shut the light
2066,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,Of other things external from the mind
2067,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Of Shylock’s mood. Why, is it strange at all"
2068,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,For a soul that incarnates itself with souls
2069,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Like Brutus’ and Lear’s to lose itself,"
2070,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Seem sometimes naked, trembling, swaying too"
2071,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"With such exhaustion, such tremendous change?"
2072,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,These common minds see not the genius mind
2073,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"For what it is, forget the strength and wisdom"
2074,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"That makes the genius, in my case, forget"

2076,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Greek, Latin, German, French and Arabic,"
2077,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Hebrew and Spanish; the philosophies,"
2078,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,I’ve mastered in my life.
2079,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,
2080,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,I tremble too
2081,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"For thinking of my little son, John Wilkes,"
2082,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"So beautiful and gifted, has the touch;"
2083,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Is full of dreams, goes charging on his horse,"
2084,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Spouting heroic speeches, lance in hand"
2085,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"There on “The Farm,” a patriot and a lover"
2086,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Of liberty even now. What will he be,"
2087,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"A statesman or an actor, warrior, what?"
2088,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"God knows alone, and what his fate God knows."
2089,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"I named him after John Wilkes, patriot"
2090,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"And English libertarian--but no matter,"
2091,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,He’ll do what he will do. They named me Brutus
2092,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"And I became an actor, not a statesman,"
2093,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,"Warrior, no tyrannicide."
2094,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,
2095,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,Hold there!
2096,JUNIUS BRUTUS BOOTH,What is this? Take my hand! Sharp pain again--

2114,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,There’s not a document I have not studied

2134,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Solemn and noisy, rapt, tumultuous,"
2135,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Sober and drunk, who carry whips and spit"

2137,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The babies squall, wagons and democrats"
2138,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Befog the air with dust, and oh, the heat!"

2143,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Dimmed to the eyes this side; the sun is there!
2144,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,But yet the sun knows it is there--the dust

2147,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"These days. Oh, yes, the dust will rise at last"
2148,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"When evening--that’s reflection, settles down;"
2149,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And then you’ll see a star--first magnitude,"
2150,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The name is Lincoln!
2151,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2152,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,I have read. I know.
2153,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Never in Rome or Greece were such debates,"
2154,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Never in all this world. Look at the theme:
2155,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Slavery in a republic! As for men,"
2156,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Where is their equal? Is it Pericles,"
2157,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Demosthenes or Cicero, here with us,"
2158,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Great Webster? And the setting, think of that!"

2160,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"From town to town, stand up before the mass,"
2161,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And battle with their wits--set falcons loose
2162,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Of swift and ravenous logic to devour
2163,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The other’s flights. The crowds perceive the trend,"
2164,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Gather enough to guide them and persuade,"
2165,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,But much of it is over them. You heard
2166,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Lincoln to-day, when he had subtilized"
2167,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The point to deadly ether, say to them:"
2168,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,“An audience like this will scarcely see
2169,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The force of what I say, but minds well trained"
2170,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Will follow me and see.” That is the point.
2171,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Out of this popular oratory rises
2172,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,A durable spire of truth. This Lincoln leaves
2173,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Great thought and beauty to the race. And yet
2174,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Douglas will be our senator, and Seward"
2175,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Our President two years from now. As Webster
2176,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Could never win the prize, this Lincoln too"
2177,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Will fail to win it.
2178,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2179,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Why, you silly fools!"
2180,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Lincoln has sprained his arms and back for good--
2181,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"But he has laid the South out flat and cold,"
2182,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And broken the slavocracy in two.
2183,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,He did it with one question; asking that
2184,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"He made the Little Giant cough and stammer,"
2185,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And blush his guilt before America.
2186,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Oh, yes, he answered well enough to win"
2187,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"This contest here in Illinois; but look,"
2188,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The Southern press is after him already,"
2189,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"They scent the carcass moved, withdrawn a little;"
2190,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,They croak like buzzards--and there will be war
2191,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Between the eagles and the buzzards now,"
2192,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Perhaps when Seward is elected; truly
2193,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"If Lincoln should be chosen, as he won’t."
2194,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,It isn’t that this Douglas isn’t a master.
2195,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,It is that he is caught between the mill-stones.
2196,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The upper is this Kansas and Nebraska,"
2197,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The lower is Dred Scott--and I am glad!
2198,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Why did he father Kansas and Nebraska?
2199,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Why did he flout the ancient ordinance
2200,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Of 1787, which kept out"
2201,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"This curse of slavery, out of Illinois,"
2202,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"But brought us liberty of press and speech,"
2203,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The bill of rights? Did Congress have the power
2204,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,To pass this ordinance of ’87?
2205,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Or did it lack the power, because the states"
2206,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,That came into the union with their slaves
2207,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Might keep their slaves, reclaim as fugitive"
2208,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Their slaves on freedom’s soil? Well, if it be"
2209,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,That Congress had the power to plaster down
2210,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The ordinance of 1787
2211,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Upon this Illinois, this great Northwest,"
2212,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,It had the power to say the western land
2213,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Of Kansas and Nebraska should be free
2214,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,As territories ruled from Washington
2215,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And no imperialism! So, I say again"
2216,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"It serves this Douglas right to be destroyed,"
2217,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And ground to powder for this act of his,"
2218,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,This Kansas and Nebraska.
2219,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2220,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Well, all right."
2221,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"It sounds all right, it makes the idiots whoop"
2222,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,To hear the Little Giant say he favors
2223,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The people’s rule in Kansas and Nebraska.
2224,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Their right to say they’ll have this slavery
2225,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Or have it not--yes, popular sovereignty!--"
2226,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"But why not let the people vote on God,"
2227,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Or choose a king, or take me, all the whites,"
2228,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And make us slaves? It may be so, if truth"
2229,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Is just a mockery and there’s nothing real
2230,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,In human thought at all--one thing is true
2231,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"As anything, and everything is false."
2232,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2233,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Thus ruin smites the temple of our life,"
2234,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And all of us lie down as beasts and grunt
2235,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Around its broken arches and its columns!
2236,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2237,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,All right! He gets his Kansas and Nebraska.
2238,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,That makes him president! Not on your life!
2239,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Momus is watching, growls a horrid laugh"
2240,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And whispers something to Slavocracy,"
2241,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Which whispers it to Taney--and behold
2242,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The prophets and the guardians of the ark
2243,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Of the covenant declare a slave’s a slave,"
2244,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And can be taken to a territory,"
2245,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And kept there in the face of national law
2246,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"That makes the territory free. Or else,"
2247,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Were this not so, the Congress is supreme,"
2248,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Has slipped the chain of the organic law,"
2249,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Which recognizes slavery. What is this
2250,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,But just imperialism?
2251,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2252,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,God Almighty!
2253,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"They’re all for freedom, a republic too."
2254,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Kansas, Nebraska--let the people rule."
2255,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Dred Scott:--the Congress is a Parliament
2256,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Like England has, unless it pins and tucks"
2257,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The constitution round its pocky body.
2258,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"That may be true, but then the question is:"
2259,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Is slavery charactered upon the robe,"
2260,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And must the figure of the slave be seen
2261,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Wherever Congress walks?
2262,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2263,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,I’ll come to that.
2264,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The point is now that Douglas has been caught
2265,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Between his Kansas and Nebraska act,"
2266,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And Dred Scott never his. And being lawful,"
2267,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Obedient to the law and to the courts--
2268,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,You heard him hammer Lincoln as a man
2269,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Who flouted courts--while he, the Little Giant,"
2270,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Obeyed the laws--oh, yes!--So, being lawful,"
2271,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"As I began, must hold in level hands"
2272,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Dred Scott in one, and in the other hand"
2273,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,This Kansas and Nebraska.
2274,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2275,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Very good.
2276,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Lincoln has got him now, and out of all"
2277,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"This rhetoric, these sorties half successful,"
2278,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"These scrimmages with Lincoln, half perplexed,"
2279,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,You find your Little Giant on his back
2280,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,With Lincoln over him and pinning shoulders
2281,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Down to the floor.
2282,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2283,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Here is the wrestling trick:
2284,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Can any territory keep this slavery
2285,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Out lawfully, that is, against the wish"
2286,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Of any citizen? What is the answer?
2287,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"If you say yes, where is Dred Scott? If no,"
2288,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,How do the people rule?
2289,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2290,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,What is his answer?
2291,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Why, yes, he says, a territory can"
2292,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Keep slavery out. Dred Scott still sends it there,"
2293,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"But then the people rule, and if the people"
2294,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,There in Nebraska make it hot for slavery
2295,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"By local law and custom, frowns and blows,"
2296,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,It will not thrive. That satisfied the crowd;
2297,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Enough at least, elects him Senator,"
2298,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"But loses him the South, the golden prize,"
2299,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Splits up the country, gives us war in time,"
2300,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,When argument is silenced cannon boom--
2301,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And when your Seward comes to Washington
2302,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The South secedes.
2303,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2304,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Now, listen for a moment!"
2305,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,What is Abe Lincoln’s genealogy
2306,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"In faith political? Sired by the Federalists,"
2307,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And mothered by the Whigs. A tariff man;
2308,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Believes too in the Bank--tariffs and banks
2309,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Filched from the plenary stores of privilege
2310,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,By hands that break the shackles of the law.
2311,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"He’s born a Whig, has turned Republican,"
2312,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"What is his blood? Why, liberal construction,"
2313,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Twisting the constitution out of shape,"
2314,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And tearing holes in it to let the Congress
2315,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Escape and wander--where? Why, anywhere!"
2316,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And though it be that touching slavery
2317,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,There’s nothing which forbids the Congress acting
2318,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,In freedom’s way--and that’s the very point--
2319,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And granting that the Constitution’s over
2320,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The territories, still the Congress can"
2321,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Bring freedom there--this theory is akin
2322,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"To loose construction, scarcely can be told"
2323,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"From loose construction. For you see, if freedom,"
2324,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Since Congress is not hampered, can be brought,"
2325,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Why not then slavery, if it be not hampered?"
2326,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And why not colonies, dependencies,"
2327,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Ruled just as Congress wills, if never a word"
2328,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Lies in our charter to forbid or grant
2329,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,The power to do it.
2330,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,
2331,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Well, there’ll be a war,"
2332,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And hell thereafter. So you like my talk!
2333,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"What is my name? Why, Satan is my name--"
2334,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"And I go wandering on the earth to see,"
2335,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Walk to and fro and laugh and drop a tear
2336,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,In spite of all my laughter. Tears and laughter
2337,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"For ideas in the heads of men that seethe,"
2338,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Pop, crackle, ferment, blow up bottles, kegs,"
2339,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Spill and destroy bacteria on the floor
2340,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Of epochs, ruin wisdoms, cultures, faiths."
2341,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,Time scrubs the floor of all such verses--Time
2342,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"Matures fresh grapes, new ferments, and repeats"
2343,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,"The old catastrophes; and hence I laugh,"
2344,A CERTAIN POET ON THE DEBATES,And drop a tear on all the sorry waste.

2574,ANOTHER VOICE,_The vision grows confused. Lincoln seems to himself to attempt to

2577,ANOTHER VOICE,which there are lights and faces. Voices are mingled together
2578,ANOTHER VOICE,indistinguishably and then fade away. There is a silence. Out of
2579,ANOTHER VOICE,"the confusion two figures emerge, one bright, the other shadowy."
2580,ANOTHER VOICE,Both are images of Lincoln. They become seated in a boat which is

2674,SECOND PHANTOM,On human will and thought you must concede
2675,SECOND PHANTOM,"A contradiction in your dream, who break"
2676,SECOND PHANTOM,The law a rebel spirit to arrest.
2677,SECOND PHANTOM,This is a way of sowing nettle seed.
2678,SECOND PHANTOM,"Once you were faithful to a better creed,"
2679,SECOND PHANTOM,That men may found new nations when the old
2680,SECOND PHANTOM,No longer have the people’s fair consent.
2681,SECOND PHANTOM,Rights are not hostile. If this be a right
2682,SECOND PHANTOM,How may you overthrow it with your might?
2683,SECOND PHANTOM,
2684,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2685,FIRST PHANTOM,
2686,FIRST PHANTOM,Have you not heard this story of me told:
2687,FIRST PHANTOM,At New Orleans I saw the children cry
2688,FIRST PHANTOM,When from the auction block their sire was sold.
2689,FIRST PHANTOM,I then resolved to strike this curse a blow
2690,FIRST PHANTOM,If ever Heaven gave
2691,FIRST PHANTOM,My arm the strength. It is my deepest hate.
2692,FIRST PHANTOM,
2693,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2694,SECOND PHANTOM,
2695,SECOND PHANTOM,This is the thought then lying further back
2696,SECOND PHANTOM,"In your fanatic spirit, child of woe,"
2697,SECOND PHANTOM,Reached through a devious and hidden track!
2698,SECOND PHANTOM,For this you will prepare your country’s grave.
2699,SECOND PHANTOM,"You will free some, but only to enslave"
2700,SECOND PHANTOM,A wider realm of being.
2701,SECOND PHANTOM,
2702,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2703,FIRST PHANTOM,
2704,FIRST PHANTOM,I would know
2705,FIRST PHANTOM,What may be best.
2706,FIRST PHANTOM,
2707,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2708,SECOND PHANTOM,
2709,SECOND PHANTOM,The country is at peace.
2710,SECOND PHANTOM,You do not dare to ask your Congress for
2711,SECOND PHANTOM,Troops on the Southern people to make war.
2712,SECOND PHANTOM,
2713,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2714,FIRST PHANTOM,
2715,FIRST PHANTOM,I do not need to ask. I have enrolled
2716,FIRST PHANTOM,An oath with God the Nation to uphold.
2717,FIRST PHANTOM,
2718,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2719,SECOND PHANTOM,
2720,SECOND PHANTOM,But if you call the troops will you not ask
2721,SECOND PHANTOM,Congress to validate your powers’ increase
2722,SECOND PHANTOM,And sharpening of the sword for such a task?
2723,SECOND PHANTOM,"You do not answer. Well, if this may be"
2724,SECOND PHANTOM,Do you not contemplate a tyranny?
2725,SECOND PHANTOM,
2726,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2727,FIRST PHANTOM,
2728,FIRST PHANTOM,"What is this rupture but a mere defection,"
2729,FIRST PHANTOM,"What might be called rebellion, insurrection"
2730,FIRST PHANTOM,"Against the laws, which I must overthrow,"
2731,FIRST PHANTOM,As others did before me from the first?
2732,FIRST PHANTOM,No word writ in the charter of the nation
2733,FIRST PHANTOM,Has made provision for its termination.
2734,FIRST PHANTOM,
2735,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2736,SECOND PHANTOM,
2737,SECOND PHANTOM,But not to argue this--you have reversed
2738,SECOND PHANTOM,Your mind upon the right of revolution.
2739,SECOND PHANTOM,
2740,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2741,FIRST PHANTOM,
2742,FIRST PHANTOM,Not for a righteous or a holy cause.
2743,FIRST PHANTOM,
2744,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2745,SECOND PHANTOM,
2746,SECOND PHANTOM,You test it in your own soul’s resolution.
2747,SECOND PHANTOM,But tell me when there are no writs or laws
2748,SECOND PHANTOM,For you to execute in the Southern land
2749,SECOND PHANTOM,How are you acting?
2750,SECOND PHANTOM,
2751,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2752,FIRST PHANTOM,
2753,FIRST PHANTOM,But I still command
2754,FIRST PHANTOM,"The property and forts, and other places"
2755,FIRST PHANTOM,Belonging to the Nation.
2756,FIRST PHANTOM,
2757,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2758,SECOND PHANTOM,
2759,SECOND PHANTOM,Understand
2760,SECOND PHANTOM,Their territory all such forts embraces
2761,SECOND PHANTOM,And sovereignty thereover is resumed.
2762,SECOND PHANTOM,"You cannot have a war on that account,"
2763,SECOND PHANTOM,When they would pay you for the places lost.
2764,SECOND PHANTOM,
2765,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2766,FIRST PHANTOM,
2767,FIRST PHANTOM,First the rebellious spirit must surmount
2768,FIRST PHANTOM,The barriers that keep them home with us.
2769,FIRST PHANTOM,"They cannot leave us, cannot take and hold"
2770,FIRST PHANTOM,"What is not theirs, or what if they had sold"
2771,FIRST PHANTOM,They could not grant.
2772,FIRST PHANTOM,
2773,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2774,SECOND PHANTOM,
2775,SECOND PHANTOM,That is but bloody gold.
2776,SECOND PHANTOM,And what you say if acted on will bring
2777,SECOND PHANTOM,A million deaths.
2778,SECOND PHANTOM,
2779,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2780,FIRST PHANTOM,
2781,FIRST PHANTOM,They are responsible
2782,FIRST PHANTOM,For all the consequences if they cling
2783,FIRST PHANTOM,To this rebellious purpose.
2784,FIRST PHANTOM,
2785,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2786,SECOND PHANTOM,
2787,SECOND PHANTOM,To compel
2788,SECOND PHANTOM,This fortress’s provisioning
2789,SECOND PHANTOM,Will be a blow first struck. It is the law:
2790,SECOND PHANTOM,The first blow of a war is struck by him
2791,SECOND PHANTOM,Who makes the first blow needful to be struck.
2792,SECOND PHANTOM,
2793,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2794,FIRST PHANTOM,
2795,FIRST PHANTOM,You put the woven substance in a ruck.
2796,FIRST PHANTOM,I leave the issue of a war with them.
2797,FIRST PHANTOM,"They shall not be assailed, nor may they have"
2798,FIRST PHANTOM,Conflict with me unless they first aggress
2799,FIRST PHANTOM,The government.
2800,FIRST PHANTOM,
2801,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2802,SECOND PHANTOM,
2803,SECOND PHANTOM,"Oh, then they must withdraw"
2804,SECOND PHANTOM,Resistance to your plan.
2805,SECOND PHANTOM,
2806,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2807,FIRST PHANTOM,
2808,FIRST PHANTOM,"Well, I confess"
2809,FIRST PHANTOM,"No open plan, as yet. But now attend:"
2810,FIRST PHANTOM,I have an oath in heaven registered
2811,FIRST PHANTOM,"The Union to preserve, protect, defend;"
2812,FIRST PHANTOM,They have no oath the Union to destroy.
2813,FIRST PHANTOM,
2814,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2815,SECOND PHANTOM,
2816,SECOND PHANTOM,What is the Union but a verbal toy
2817,SECOND PHANTOM,"Like Justice, Beauty, Liberty or Truth?"
2818,SECOND PHANTOM,"And as for them they need not take an oath,"
2819,SECOND PHANTOM,They need but act.
2820,SECOND PHANTOM,
2821,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2822,FIRST PHANTOM,
2823,FIRST PHANTOM,"The Union is unbroken, is a pact"
2824,FIRST PHANTOM,Which cannot be erased or torn apart
2825,FIRST PHANTOM,By less than half of those who gave it breath.
2826,FIRST PHANTOM,
2827,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2828,SECOND PHANTOM,
2829,SECOND PHANTOM,How does a State sink partly into death
2830,SECOND PHANTOM,By joining other States? Can it accede
2831,SECOND PHANTOM,And thereby lose its virtue to secede?
2832,SECOND PHANTOM,
2833,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2834,FIRST PHANTOM,
2835,FIRST PHANTOM,The Union is much older than accession.
2836,FIRST PHANTOM,
2837,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2838,SECOND PHANTOM,
2839,SECOND PHANTOM,"Some Union, not the Union which you rule."
2840,SECOND PHANTOM,The states which formed the old Confederacy
2841,SECOND PHANTOM,Withdrew to form the Union. Liberty
2842,SECOND PHANTOM,Is older than all States.
2843,SECOND PHANTOM,Her handmaiden has always been secession.
2844,SECOND PHANTOM,
2845,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2846,FIRST PHANTOM,
2847,FIRST PHANTOM,These arguments are used but to befool
2848,FIRST PHANTOM,The minds who loathe the wrong they would conceal.
2849,FIRST PHANTOM,No justice will be lost by him who waits.
2850,FIRST PHANTOM,
2851,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2852,SECOND PHANTOM,
2853,SECOND PHANTOM,They ask a council for the general weal
2854,SECOND PHANTOM,Of all the States these matters to arrange
2855,SECOND PHANTOM,Without the flow of blood.
2856,SECOND PHANTOM,
2857,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2858,FIRST PHANTOM,
2859,FIRST PHANTOM,I shall not change
2860,FIRST PHANTOM,"What I have said: If God who rules above,"
2861,FIRST PHANTOM,"Almighty Ruler of all nations, deems"
2862,FIRST PHANTOM,"Eternal truth with them, or with our side,"
2863,FIRST PHANTOM,That truth eternal ever must abide.
2864,FIRST PHANTOM,
2865,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2866,SECOND PHANTOM,
2867,SECOND PHANTOM,But after all the truth is that which seems
2868,SECOND PHANTOM,"The truth to you. And if mankind you love,"
2869,SECOND PHANTOM,Why draw the sword to justify such truth?
2870,SECOND PHANTOM,Has any warrior of the world said more?
2871,SECOND PHANTOM,
2872,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2873,FIRST PHANTOM,
2874,FIRST PHANTOM,The people may be trusted to restore
2875,FIRST PHANTOM,"All broken rights, to them I leave all things."
2876,FIRST PHANTOM,
2877,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2878,SECOND PHANTOM,
2879,SECOND PHANTOM,What do you say? These dubious wanderings
2880,SECOND PHANTOM,Travel along a pathway scarcely smooth.
2881,SECOND PHANTOM,You vowed to let no forces intermit
2882,SECOND PHANTOM,"The Nation’s laws in no place, save the means"
2883,SECOND PHANTOM,"Which should be requisite,"
2884,SECOND PHANTOM,Were by the people from your arms withheld.
2885,SECOND PHANTOM,You do not let them choose when you’ve compelled
2886,SECOND PHANTOM,"Their action by your act, which intervenes"
2887,SECOND PHANTOM,Their virgin will and what you do before
2888,SECOND PHANTOM,"You learn its voice. Yes, so arise all wars!"
2889,SECOND PHANTOM,What people ever had a chance to voice
2890,SECOND PHANTOM,Free and deliberate their honest choice
2891,SECOND PHANTOM,’Twixt war and peace? Kings leave them to deplore
2892,SECOND PHANTOM,The initial step while fighting to retrieve
2893,SECOND PHANTOM,Or mitigate its ills. Your counselors
2894,SECOND PHANTOM,"Have spoken, and your counselors believe"
2895,SECOND PHANTOM,The pending step unwise. So at the last
2896,SECOND PHANTOM,Out of all dialectics stand two men
2897,SECOND PHANTOM,"Each judging, each appealing to the shrine"
2898,SECOND PHANTOM,"Of God, Eternal Justice, all unknown,"
2899,SECOND PHANTOM,Save as they see reflections of them cast
2900,SECOND PHANTOM,In their refracted speculations--then
2901,SECOND PHANTOM,What is it but the clash of sovereignties
2902,SECOND PHANTOM,Grown firmer from offense and wounded pride?
2903,SECOND PHANTOM,Yet cunning to manipulate decrees
2904,SECOND PHANTOM,With forethought in successive acts to hide
2905,SECOND PHANTOM,"Provocative offenses, put in fault"
2906,SECOND PHANTOM,The other sovereign for the first assault.
2907,SECOND PHANTOM,
2908,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2909,FIRST PHANTOM,
2910,FIRST PHANTOM,"One man may risk his life, or suffer wrong,"
2911,FIRST PHANTOM,He has no other but himself at stake.
2912,FIRST PHANTOM,"A ruler has been chosen to be strong,"
2913,FIRST PHANTOM,And save his people for his people’s sake.
2914,FIRST PHANTOM,"The clearest vision, most commanding power,"
2915,FIRST PHANTOM,"Interprets and must rule the hour,"
2916,FIRST PHANTOM,Must call its purest sense of duty God.
2917,FIRST PHANTOM,"Must stake its being now, in worlds to come"
2918,FIRST PHANTOM,Before what thrones of judgment chance to be.
2919,FIRST PHANTOM,One phase alone of life’s immensity
2920,FIRST PHANTOM,"May one o’ermaster, though it bring him doom"
2921,FIRST PHANTOM,"For things unseen, the path he never trod"
2922,FIRST PHANTOM,Strewn with his errors. Yet he may be free
2923,FIRST PHANTOM,By acting through that genesis and win
2924,FIRST PHANTOM,Approval for the warp. No soul has room
2925,FIRST PHANTOM,"For growth in love, but may it also thrive"
2926,FIRST PHANTOM,To needed power in thought. If heaven require
2927,FIRST PHANTOM,"Excess in either, while the other shrinks"
2928,FIRST PHANTOM,"In heaven’s ends, should heaven then requite"
2929,FIRST PHANTOM,The sacrifice with penitential fire?
2930,FIRST PHANTOM,It is enough that whosoever drinks
2931,FIRST PHANTOM,"Of such success finds bitterness within,"
2932,FIRST PHANTOM,The cup on earth. Can anyone begrudge
2933,FIRST PHANTOM,"The work before me, sword that I possess?"
2934,FIRST PHANTOM,Nor do I of another’s motives judge.
2935,FIRST PHANTOM,"If rights conflict not, yet one master right"
2936,FIRST PHANTOM,Attuned to highest law must still prevail
2937,FIRST PHANTOM,And lesser laws must fail.
2938,FIRST PHANTOM,"The winds of destiny may bear me far,"
2939,FIRST PHANTOM,Which out of deepest heaven are arising.
2940,FIRST PHANTOM,"I have one compass and one guiding star,"
2941,FIRST PHANTOM,One altar for my spirit’s sacrificing:
2942,FIRST PHANTOM,The Union is my soul’s profoundest love.
2943,FIRST PHANTOM,
2944,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2945,SECOND PHANTOM,
2946,SECOND PHANTOM,"If you knew heaven’s wish you might fulfill it,"
2947,SECOND PHANTOM,"Seen heaven’s law revealed, then you might will it,"
2948,SECOND PHANTOM,What man can say he knows the word thereof?
2949,SECOND PHANTOM,"Oh, not alone you dedicate your life"
2950,SECOND PHANTOM,To this adventure in uncertain strife!
2951,SECOND PHANTOM,You give the Nation’s blood and spirit too.
2952,SECOND PHANTOM,If you could know the Nation would renew
2953,SECOND PHANTOM,"Its strength in years or cycles from your thought,"
2954,SECOND PHANTOM,And through your godlike daring might be wrought
2955,SECOND PHANTOM,"To finer triumphs in the time to come,"
2956,SECOND PHANTOM,You would have warrant to pronounce the doom
2957,SECOND PHANTOM,"Of blood and tears to fertilize the soil,"
2958,SECOND PHANTOM,Where at the start revenge and hate will grow.
2959,SECOND PHANTOM,But what unending sorrow may recoil
2960,SECOND PHANTOM,"Upon your purposes, who do not know?"
2961,SECOND PHANTOM,
2962,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2963,FIRST PHANTOM,
2964,FIRST PHANTOM,What are these cliffs of purple which we near?
2965,FIRST PHANTOM,Gray castes of stagnant mists above them lie.
2966,FIRST PHANTOM,The boat glides downward as if in a sphere
2967,FIRST PHANTOM,"Of liquid crystal mowing, dizzily"
2968,FIRST PHANTOM,The forked rocks point upward to the sky--
2969,FIRST PHANTOM,Have I then died?
2970,FIRST PHANTOM,
2971,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2972,SECOND PHANTOM,
2973,SECOND PHANTOM,There is a place of moss
2974,SECOND PHANTOM,Whereon the prow must strike lest it be crushed.
2975,SECOND PHANTOM,
2976,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2977,FIRST PHANTOM,
2978,FIRST PHANTOM,This is the world’s end. How the air is hushed!
2979,FIRST PHANTOM,
2980,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2981,SECOND PHANTOM,
2982,SECOND PHANTOM,Come now! You have been ferried well across.
2983,SECOND PHANTOM,There! We have landed. Hear the whispering keel.
2984,SECOND PHANTOM,
2985,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2986,FIRST PHANTOM,
2987,FIRST PHANTOM,I’m growing faint.
2988,FIRST PHANTOM,
2989,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2990,SECOND PHANTOM,
2991,SECOND PHANTOM,Much still must I reveal.
2992,SECOND PHANTOM,We two must stand on yonder highest rock.
2993,SECOND PHANTOM,
2994,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
2995,FIRST PHANTOM,
2996,FIRST PHANTOM,It cannot be!
2997,FIRST PHANTOM,
2998,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
2999,SECOND PHANTOM,
3000,SECOND PHANTOM,I will the door unlock.
3001,SECOND PHANTOM,They may not be away. First let me knock.
3002,SECOND PHANTOM,
3003,SECOND PHANTOM,(_He knocks on the cliff. The vision grows cloudy._)
3004,SECOND PHANTOM,
3005,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3006,FIRST PHANTOM,
3007,FIRST PHANTOM,What heights are these where midway to the sea
3008,FIRST PHANTOM,The gulls like flakes of snow eddy around!
3009,FIRST PHANTOM,
3010,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3011,SECOND PHANTOM,
3012,SECOND PHANTOM,The purple wastes lie under a shorn sun.
3013,SECOND PHANTOM,"They do not bleed, no golden ooze is seen,"
3014,SECOND PHANTOM,No arrows pierce them.
3015,SECOND PHANTOM,
3016,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3017,FIRST PHANTOM,
3018,FIRST PHANTOM,And how could it be?
3019,FIRST PHANTOM,"A barrier of mud, a sunken realm"
3020,FIRST PHANTOM,With shores where wrecks are rotting are before you.
3021,FIRST PHANTOM,They sleep upon the tideless water.
3022,FIRST PHANTOM,
3023,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3024,SECOND PHANTOM,
3025,SECOND PHANTOM,"Yes,"
3026,SECOND PHANTOM,This is a quiet sea of perished dreams!
3027,SECOND PHANTOM,
3028,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3029,FIRST PHANTOM,
3030,FIRST PHANTOM,"Greater than Asia was this kingdom once,"
3031,FIRST PHANTOM,But in a war it sank.
3032,FIRST PHANTOM,
3033,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3034,SECOND PHANTOM,
3035,SECOND PHANTOM,What is the tale?
3036,SECOND PHANTOM,
3037,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3038,FIRST PHANTOM,
3039,FIRST PHANTOM,There was a city set upon a hill
3040,FIRST PHANTOM,Which heaven governed as a pilot guides
3041,FIRST PHANTOM,"The vessel from the stern, by force of thought."
3042,FIRST PHANTOM,Till spirits here were given air and light
3043,FIRST PHANTOM,"To prove their natures, for it was the wish"
3044,FIRST PHANTOM,Of that first pair which built its earliest hearth.
3045,FIRST PHANTOM,"There since the husband worked with iron and fire,"
3046,FIRST PHANTOM,"Where twenty bellows blew, and all the day"
3047,FIRST PHANTOM,"The anvil sounded in a shop, which seemed"
3048,FIRST PHANTOM,"A palace thick with stars, and giants bore"
3049,FIRST PHANTOM,"Great burdens, wielded sledges, and obeyed"
3050,FIRST PHANTOM,"The master workman, so the city heaped"
3051,FIRST PHANTOM,Great store of armament and priceless works.
3052,FIRST PHANTOM,Meanwhile the woman in whose eyes and brow
3053,FIRST PHANTOM,"The final reason, compress of all light"
3054,FIRST PHANTOM,"Made of all lights absorbed, resolved, and tamed"
3055,FIRST PHANTOM,"Lay like a high serenity of power,"
3056,FIRST PHANTOM,"Or balanced wisdom, bore great sons to rule"
3057,FIRST PHANTOM,The state and to preserve it in the wars
3058,FIRST PHANTOM,"When wars should come. In peace to keep the courts,"
3059,FIRST PHANTOM,"And laws like to their mother’s face, a face"
3060,FIRST PHANTOM,"Which awed the dullest slave, out of whose brain"
3061,FIRST PHANTOM,The idea like a statue carved in rock
3062,FIRST PHANTOM,"By hammers broken, rolled, beholding it."
3063,FIRST PHANTOM,"She taught her sons that some are born to rule,"
3064,FIRST PHANTOM,"And some to serve, and some to carry torches,"
3065,FIRST PHANTOM,And some to blow the bellows for the fire
3066,FIRST PHANTOM,Where torches may be lit; and how a state
3067,FIRST PHANTOM,Where high and low remain as high and low
3068,FIRST PHANTOM,"So long as nature wills, move in a sphere"
3069,FIRST PHANTOM,"Of democratic laws, where all may have"
3070,FIRST PHANTOM,"The bread they earn, and where no strength may seize"
3071,FIRST PHANTOM,"Another’s happiness, another’s bread."
3072,FIRST PHANTOM,Hence was it that she fired her sons to drive
3073,FIRST PHANTOM,"A giant troubler from the city’s gates,"
3074,FIRST PHANTOM,And shut him up in Sicily.
3075,FIRST PHANTOM,
3076,FIRST PHANTOM,But the land
3077,FIRST PHANTOM,Over whose hills and vales the waters lie
3078,FIRST PHANTOM,There where we look had other life. I speak:
3079,FIRST PHANTOM,"It was a land of many lakes and rivers,"
3080,FIRST PHANTOM,"And plains and meadows, mountains full of ore,"
3081,FIRST PHANTOM,"Both gold and silver, copper, precious stones."
3082,FIRST PHANTOM,"And valued wood, most fruitful of all things,"
3083,FIRST PHANTOM,"Herbage or roots, or corn, whatever gives"
3084,FIRST PHANTOM,Delight or sustenance. And the ruler’s strength
3085,FIRST PHANTOM,Brought riches from all ports. But to relate
3086,FIRST PHANTOM,"Its founder’s part, the country was divided"
3087,FIRST PHANTOM,Among ten rulers who had sworn to obey
3088,FIRST PHANTOM,"Injunctions carven on a shaft of gold,"
3089,FIRST PHANTOM,Erected in the middle of the realm.
3090,FIRST PHANTOM,And here the people of the several States
3091,FIRST PHANTOM,"Gathered for conference on the general weal,"
3092,FIRST PHANTOM,And to inquire if any of the states
3093,FIRST PHANTOM,"Had trespassed on the other, or transgressed"
3094,FIRST PHANTOM,"The writing on the shaft of gold, and pass"
3095,FIRST PHANTOM,Appropriate judgment; for upon the shaft
3096,FIRST PHANTOM,Curses were graven on the recreant.
3097,FIRST PHANTOM,And it was written none should take up arms
3098,FIRST PHANTOM,Against the other; and if one should raise
3099,FIRST PHANTOM,His hand against the central strength (for where
3100,FIRST PHANTOM,"The shaft of gold stood, there a palace stood"
3101,FIRST PHANTOM,"Where lived a ruler speaking for them all),"
3102,FIRST PHANTOM,Then should the others rescue it and fling
3103,FIRST PHANTOM,The rebels back.
3104,FIRST PHANTOM,
3105,FIRST PHANTOM,Such was this empire lost
3106,FIRST PHANTOM,And so did it remain so long as men
3107,FIRST PHANTOM,Obeyed the laws and heaven loved. At first
3108,FIRST PHANTOM,"They practiced wisdom, they despised all things"
3109,FIRST PHANTOM,"Save virtue only, lightly thought of gold,"
3110,FIRST PHANTOM,"Were sober, hated luxury, knew control"
3111,FIRST PHANTOM,Of passions and of self. And knew that wealth
3112,FIRST PHANTOM,"Grows with such virtues, and by unity"
3113,FIRST PHANTOM,"With one another, but by zeal for wealth"
3114,FIRST PHANTOM,All friendship dies. And so they waxed in store
3115,FIRST PHANTOM,"Of gold and spirit. But at last the soul,"
3116,FIRST PHANTOM,"Which was divine and moved in them, fell off"
3117,FIRST PHANTOM,"And weakened, grew diluted with too much"
3118,FIRST PHANTOM,"Of human nature, and became unjust,"
3119,FIRST PHANTOM,"Cruel and base, voracious, drunken, lost"
3120,FIRST PHANTOM,"To wisdom, discipline; and the seeing eye"
3121,FIRST PHANTOM,"Saw all good things forgotten, but to those"
3122,FIRST PHANTOM,Who had no eye to see true happiness
3123,FIRST PHANTOM,"They still appeared most blest and glorious,"
3124,FIRST PHANTOM,Filled as they were with avarice and lust.
3125,FIRST PHANTOM,"So then arose one state, and then another"
3126,FIRST PHANTOM,"Against the central ruler, none was free"
3127,FIRST PHANTOM,Of disobedience to the graven words
3128,FIRST PHANTOM,"Upon the shaft of gold, until at last"
3129,FIRST PHANTOM,The city on the hill watching the strife
3130,FIRST PHANTOM,Embarked with troops.
3131,FIRST PHANTOM,
3132,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3133,SECOND PHANTOM,
3134,SECOND PHANTOM,Have you not prophesied
3135,SECOND PHANTOM,Your country’s fate if you assault the South?
3136,SECOND PHANTOM,It is the zeal for wealth that cries for war.
3137,SECOND PHANTOM,"From such a war our spirit shall be lost,"
3138,SECOND PHANTOM,"Our justice fouled, our friendship turned to hate,"
3139,SECOND PHANTOM,Our laughter rendered drunken. We shall be
3140,SECOND PHANTOM,"The city on the hill, the island lost--"
3141,SECOND PHANTOM,Have both not perished?
3142,SECOND PHANTOM,
3143,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3144,FIRST PHANTOM,
3145,FIRST PHANTOM,Stay! It is enough
3146,FIRST PHANTOM,"To live amid the misery of today,"
3147,FIRST PHANTOM,Without this contemplation of the past.
3148,FIRST PHANTOM,"What is this sky, this earth to which we come?"
3149,FIRST PHANTOM,"This nothingness, this substance, air and rock"
3150,FIRST PHANTOM,Which to our life is hard reality
3151,FIRST PHANTOM,"And to our thought a dream? All nature sings,"
3152,FIRST PHANTOM,"Creates, rejoices, man alone has life"
3153,FIRST PHANTOM,"In pain as life, unfolding life as pain,"
3154,FIRST PHANTOM,As if a child could live but never be
3155,FIRST PHANTOM,Delivered from the womb. And for myself
3156,FIRST PHANTOM,"What am I but a creature, heart and head,"
3157,FIRST PHANTOM,Hands reaching up to catch at rock or bough?
3158,FIRST PHANTOM,"Hands, heart and head of flesh, immortal fire,"
3159,FIRST PHANTOM,"With feet unshapen, still a part of earth"
3160,FIRST PHANTOM,Where from that undistinguished mass of clay
3161,FIRST PHANTOM,"Hands, heart and head would pluck them? I could faint,"
3162,FIRST PHANTOM,Fly from the task before me but for this:
3163,FIRST PHANTOM,The will which when confronted bares its face
3164,FIRST PHANTOM,"And says go on, or lie down with the beasts"
3165,FIRST PHANTOM,In silence and corruption. Let me look
3166,FIRST PHANTOM,No more upon this sea!
3167,FIRST PHANTOM,
3168,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3169,SECOND PHANTOM,
3170,SECOND PHANTOM,Where shall we go?
3171,SECOND PHANTOM,
3172,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3173,FIRST PHANTOM,
3174,FIRST PHANTOM,"To some place less disquieting, more secure."
3175,FIRST PHANTOM,
3176,FIRST PHANTOM,"(_They leave the heights and descend, approaching a mysterious"
3177,FIRST PHANTOM,place where heaven and earth are connected by gates._)
3178,FIRST PHANTOM,
3179,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3180,FIRST PHANTOM,
3181,FIRST PHANTOM,I can no further walk or fly.
3182,FIRST PHANTOM,
3183,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3184,SECOND PHANTOM,
3185,SECOND PHANTOM,You enter at these gates near by.
3186,SECOND PHANTOM,
3187,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3188,FIRST PHANTOM,
3189,FIRST PHANTOM,"I fall through space. Your hand, my friend."
3190,FIRST PHANTOM,
3191,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3192,SECOND PHANTOM,
3193,SECOND PHANTOM,Quietly like a star descend.
3194,SECOND PHANTOM,
3195,SECOND PHANTOM,
3196,SECOND PHANTOM,(_They pass through the gates into a meadow._)
3197,SECOND PHANTOM,
3198,SECOND PHANTOM,
3199,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3200,FIRST PHANTOM,
3201,FIRST PHANTOM,What is this meadow which I see?
3202,FIRST PHANTOM,
3203,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3204,SECOND PHANTOM,
3205,SECOND PHANTOM,Here come the souls of men to be.
3206,SECOND PHANTOM,Can you remember what you said
3207,SECOND PHANTOM,Among the living and the dead:
3208,SECOND PHANTOM,I would know heaven’s deepest law
3209,SECOND PHANTOM,"And flood the world of men with light,"
3210,SECOND PHANTOM,I would bring justice and be just.
3211,SECOND PHANTOM,
3212,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3213,FIRST PHANTOM,
3214,FIRST PHANTOM,Out of each soul’s prenatal night
3215,FIRST PHANTOM,Something of what you say returns.
3216,FIRST PHANTOM,The soul descending into dust
3217,FIRST PHANTOM,Loses its memory as it burns
3218,FIRST PHANTOM,Less brightly when the spirit wanes.
3219,FIRST PHANTOM,
3220,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3221,SECOND PHANTOM,
3222,SECOND PHANTOM,Behold that pillar of splendor shining
3223,SECOND PHANTOM,And bound to earth and heaven by chains!
3224,SECOND PHANTOM,You see the distaff to it fixed
3225,SECOND PHANTOM,"And in the distaff whorls of iron,"
3226,SECOND PHANTOM,"Each rising to a higher rim,"
3227,SECOND PHANTOM,And on each whirling rim a siren
3228,SECOND PHANTOM,"Chants, as you hear, her solemn hymn."
3229,SECOND PHANTOM,
3230,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3231,FIRST PHANTOM,
3232,FIRST PHANTOM,I hear it with the singing mixed
3233,FIRST PHANTOM,Of one upon whose giant knee
3234,FIRST PHANTOM,The distaff turns to hands that reach
3235,FIRST PHANTOM,From thrones which stand at equal spaces.
3236,FIRST PHANTOM,
3237,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3238,SECOND PHANTOM,
3239,SECOND PHANTOM,"The giant is Necessity,"
3240,SECOND PHANTOM,The Fates are reaching from the thrones.
3241,SECOND PHANTOM,
3242,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3243,FIRST PHANTOM,
3244,FIRST PHANTOM,Such garlands for such darkened faces!
3245,FIRST PHANTOM,"What are these solemn monotones,"
3246,FIRST PHANTOM,"Which are not music, are not speech?"
3247,FIRST PHANTOM,
3248,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3249,SECOND PHANTOM,
3250,SECOND PHANTOM,They labor through Eternity.
3251,SECOND PHANTOM,The Universe of visible things
3252,SECOND PHANTOM,Turns with the distaff here again.
3253,SECOND PHANTOM,The dead come back with questionings
3254,SECOND PHANTOM,"Of earthly failure, loss or pain,"
3255,SECOND PHANTOM,And would choose better than before.
3256,SECOND PHANTOM,Some say that Agamemnon chose
3257,SECOND PHANTOM,The loneliness of eagle wings
3258,SECOND PHANTOM,In hatred of his mortal woes.
3259,SECOND PHANTOM,
3260,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3261,FIRST PHANTOM,
3262,FIRST PHANTOM,"From dreams like these I must be free! I know,"
3263,FIRST PHANTOM,"Dread phantom, you are nothing but myself."
3264,FIRST PHANTOM,"You stand before me lately, mocking elf,"
3265,FIRST PHANTOM,"Too much, and follow me where’er I go."
3266,FIRST PHANTOM,"What this portends I know not, death I fear."
3267,FIRST PHANTOM,But what seems just to do I shall perform.
3268,FIRST PHANTOM,"A nation’s destiny is mine to steer,"
3269,FIRST PHANTOM,A people’s hope is on me in the storm.
3270,FIRST PHANTOM,Behind these voices when they sing or laugh
3271,FIRST PHANTOM,I hear the droning of the telegraph:
3272,FIRST PHANTOM,Come! I would study now the last dispatches.
3273,FIRST PHANTOM,
3274,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3275,SECOND PHANTOM,
3276,SECOND PHANTOM,No meaning it is clear your soul attaches
3277,SECOND PHANTOM,"To thrones, or sirens, or the giant knees."
3278,SECOND PHANTOM,You have not fixed upon a policy.
3279,SECOND PHANTOM,
3280,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3281,FIRST PHANTOM,
3282,FIRST PHANTOM,I shall be guided--
3283,FIRST PHANTOM,
3284,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3285,SECOND PHANTOM,
3286,SECOND PHANTOM,By necessity--
3287,SECOND PHANTOM,
3288,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3289,FIRST PHANTOM,
3290,FIRST PHANTOM,"Well, yes, but by the will of God as well."
3291,FIRST PHANTOM,
3292,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3293,SECOND PHANTOM,
3294,SECOND PHANTOM,How can you tell it from the will of hell?

3298,FIRST THRONE,FIRST THRONE
3299,FIRST THRONE,
3300,FIRST THRONE,Here I sit spinning
3301,FIRST THRONE,From what beginning
3302,FIRST THRONE,Did I begin?
3303,FIRST THRONE,
3304,SECOND THRONE,SECOND THRONE
3305,SECOND THRONE,
3306,SECOND THRONE,Give me the thread!
3307,SECOND THRONE,I will assign him
3308,SECOND THRONE,"Grief to refine him,"
3309,SECOND THRONE,Thorns for his head.
3310,SECOND THRONE,Toil never ending
3311,SECOND THRONE,Up from his birth
3312,SECOND THRONE,This shall be leaven
3313,SECOND THRONE,To lift him from earth
3314,SECOND THRONE,Up into heaven.
3315,SECOND THRONE,
3316,SECOND THRONE,(_Many souls are crowded into the meadow. A figure takes from the
3317,SECOND THRONE,lap of Lachesis lots and scatters them._)

3319,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3320,SECOND PHANTOM,
3321,SECOND PHANTOM,"Who honors heaven, heaven wins."
3322,SECOND PHANTOM,Not here your fate on earth begins.
3323,SECOND PHANTOM,I only show you where you stood
3324,SECOND PHANTOM,Amid the fates and now your work
3325,SECOND PHANTOM,Of justice and of brotherhood.
3326,SECOND PHANTOM,"You’re weary, yet you cannot shrink"
3327,SECOND PHANTOM,The task assumed--how it increases!
3328,SECOND PHANTOM,A giant hand thrust in releases
3329,SECOND PHANTOM,"The numbered lots of mortal life,"
3330,SECOND PHANTOM,"There from the apron of Lachesis,"
3331,SECOND PHANTOM,And throws them to the multitude
3332,SECOND PHANTOM,Awaiting mortal strife.
3333,SECOND PHANTOM,
3334,SECOND THRONE,SECOND THRONE
3335,SECOND THRONE,
3336,SECOND THRONE,One fluttered to his hand. He ran
3337,SECOND THRONE,"Between the thrones, the distaff under"
3338,SECOND THRONE,Which swayed and rolled upon her knees.
3339,SECOND THRONE,The chains that bound it clanked and creaked.
3340,SECOND THRONE,The far-off depths the lightening streaked
3341,SECOND THRONE,Uprolled the deep symphonic thunder
3342,SECOND THRONE,"Which rumbled like a chariot, till"
3343,SECOND THRONE,"Its echoes died and all was still,"
3344,SECOND THRONE,Save for the tinkling pipe and purl
3345,SECOND THRONE,As faster sped the seventh whorl.
3346,SECOND THRONE,"We nodded, laughing at the game,"
3347,SECOND THRONE,And said: He’s dreaming Pericles
3348,SECOND THRONE,Who gave his soul to ancient Greece.
3349,SECOND THRONE,What will he do with such a name?
3350,SECOND THRONE,
3351,SECOND PHANTOM,SECOND PHANTOM
3352,SECOND PHANTOM,
3353,SECOND PHANTOM,Do you remember?
3354,SECOND PHANTOM,
3355,FIRST PHANTOM,FIRST PHANTOM
3356,FIRST PHANTOM,
3357,FIRST PHANTOM,I remember
3358,FIRST PHANTOM,A dream I had in early youth:
3359,FIRST PHANTOM,"My birth was humble, still I dreamed"
3360,FIRST PHANTOM,To consecrate my life to Truth
3361,FIRST PHANTOM,And for the truth to be esteemed.
3362,FIRST PHANTOM,"I love the Republic, I would see"
3363,FIRST PHANTOM,Its soil and all its people free!

3537,THE DESTINY,"Around my bed, a worthy group, and spoke"
3538,THE DESTINY,My trophies and authority and fame.
3539,THE DESTINY,Not one took notice of my greatest deeds:
3540,THE DESTINY,"No father’s heart for my fault ever broke,"
3541,THE DESTINY,Nor wailing woman tore her widow’s weeds.
3542,THE DESTINY,"Law, Freedom, Progress, Virtue, Beauty, Truth,"
3543,THE DESTINY,"Humility, Religion, Knowledge lay"
3544,THE DESTINY,Along the pathway of my city’s youth.
3545,THE DESTINY,Ill fortune forced imperial temptation
3546,THE DESTINY,And these divided even by heaven sundered
3547,THE DESTINY,Leaving to Empire and to Riches sway
3548,THE DESTINY,"O’er Beauty, Knowledge, Progress, till the day"
3549,THE DESTINY,"Of hatred, envy, bitter disputation,"
3550,THE DESTINY,"All good was sunk. Its walls and temples thundered,"
3551,THE DESTINY,My city on the hill was crushed and fell
3552,THE DESTINY,"Through lust of riches, from its elevation."
3553,THE DESTINY,Study my problem and my spirit well.
3554,THE DESTINY,Yours are not greatly different--beware
3555,THE DESTINY,Great riches for your country lest they come
3556,THE DESTINY,With weakness and debasement for a snare.
3557,THE DESTINY,And to this end curb studied greed and those
3558,THE DESTINY,"Spirits luxurious, and adventuresome,"
3559,THE DESTINY,"And those unjust, their hatred, guile oppose."
3560,THE DESTINY,"Right is a thing ’twixt equals, and the strong"
3561,THE DESTINY,"Do what they can, the weak must suffer wrong."
3562,THE DESTINY,"Therefore the balance hold for all, assuage"
3563,THE DESTINY,The fury and revenge which yet may rage

3633,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"If I had known of it--if I had known,"
3634,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"I had not played to-night, no, by the gods,"
3635,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"I had not played Marc Antony, nor heard"

3637,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,You nursed in liberty--you nourished upon
3638,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"Great thoughts and dreams, have soiled me, soiled the name"

3640,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"All spirits free, all lofty souls, the soul"
3641,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"Of Brutus and of Shakespeare. Why, till now"
3642,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,Conceal from me your vote for Lincoln--why?
3643,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"Why? In your heart of hearts you are ashamed,"
3644,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,And loose the secret now for penitence!
3645,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,For you have helped the hand that wrecks and slays
3646,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,Who will be king and on these ruined States
3647,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,"Erect a throne. He who commenced this war,"
3648,WINTER GARDEN THEATRE,And broke the law to do it. He who struck

3677,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3678,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"(_Liberty Hall, April 9th, 1865._)"
3679,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3680,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That’s done! And well, I’d rather not have gone"
3681,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To take such news. But now I’m glad you picked me--
3682,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I saw and heard him. I was ushered in,"
3683,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And after hems and haws, I said at last,"
3684,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“Lee has surrendered.”
3685,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3686,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,What a face he had
3687,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"When I said that: “Lee has surrendered.” Once,"
3688,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"When I was just a boy, I shot a sparhawk,"
3689,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Just tore his breast away, and did not kill him."
3690,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"He hopped up to a twig and perched, I peered"
3691,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Through bushes for my victim--there he was
3692,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"His breast shot all away, so I could see"
3693,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,His heart a-beating--but the sparhawk’s eyes
3694,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Were bright as dew, with pain! I thought of this"
3695,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"When I saw Alec Stephens, said to him,"
3696,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“Lee has surrendered.”
3697,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3698,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,There the midget sat
3699,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"His face as wrinkled as thin cream, as yellow"
3700,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"As squirrel skin--But ah, that piercing eye!"
3701,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"As restless as my sparhawk’s, not with moving"
3702,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"But just with light, such pained uneasiness."
3703,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"So there he sat, a thin, pale, little man,"
3704,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Wrapped in a monstrous cloak, as wide and dark"
3705,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,As his own melancholy--I shed tears
3706,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"For such soul sickness, sorrow and such eyes,"
3707,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That breast all shot away, that heart exposed"
3708,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"For eyes to see it beat, those burning eyes!"
3709,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3710,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I stood there with my hat within my hand,"
3711,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Said: “Mr. Stephens, I have come to tell you,"
3712,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Lee has surrendered.” He just looked at me
3713,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Then in a thin, cracked voice he said at once,"
3714,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“It had to come.” That’s all, “It had to come.”"
3715,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“Pray have a seat,” he added. For you see"
3716,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"He’s known me for some years, I am his friend."
3717,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“It had to come.” He only said that once.
3718,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Then, after silence, he chirped up again:"
3719,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“I knew when I came back from Hampton Roads
3720,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,It soon would be. Home-coming is the thing
3721,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"When all is over in the world you’ve loved,"
3722,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And worked with. And this Liberty Hall is good.
3723,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"My sleeplessness is not so tiring here,"
3724,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"My pain more tolerable, and as for thought,"
3725,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That goes on anywhere, and thought is life,"
3726,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And while I think, I live.”"
3727,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3728,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"He paused a minute,"
3729,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I took a seat, enthralled with what he said,"
3730,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A sparhawk in the rain, breast torn away,"
3731,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"His beating heart in view, his burning eyes!"
3732,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“But everyone will see, the North will see,"
3733,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Our cause was theirs, the South’s cause was the cause"
3734,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Of everyone both north and south. They’ll see
3735,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Their liberties not long survive our own.
3736,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"There is no difference, and cannot be"
3737,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Between empire, consolidation, none"
3738,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Between imperialism, centralism, none!”"
3739,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3740,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I saw he was disposed to talk, let fall"
3741,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,My hat upon the floor. There in that cloak
3742,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,All huddled like a child he sat and talked
3743,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"In that thin voice. Bent over, hands on knees,"
3744,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,I listened like a man bewitched.
3745,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3746,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,He said:
3747,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“As I am sick, cannot endure the strain"
3748,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of practice at the bar, am face to face"
3749,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"With silence after thunder, after war,"
3750,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"This terrifying calm, and after days"
3751,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Top full of problems, duties in my place"
3752,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"In the South, vice-president, adviser,"
3753,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Upon insoluble things, now after these"
3754,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I cannot sit here idle, so I plan"
3755,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To write a book. For, if I tell the truth,"
3756,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"My book will live, will be a shaft of granite"
3757,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Which guns can never batter. First, perhaps,"
3758,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I’ll have to go to prison, let it be."
3759,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The North is now a maniac--here I am,"
3760,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Easy to capture, but I’ll think in prison,"
3761,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Perhaps they’ll let me write, but anyway"
3762,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,I’ll try to write a book and answer questions.
3763,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3764,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“A soldier at Manassas shot to death
3765,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Asked, as he died, ‘What is it all about?’"
3766,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Thousands of boys, I fancy, asked the same"
3767,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Dying at Petersburg and Antietam,"
3768,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Cold Harbor, Gettysburg. I’ll answer them."
3769,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,I’ll dedicate the book to all true friends
3770,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of Liberty wherever they may be,"
3771,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Especially to those with eyes to look
3772,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Upon a federation of free states as means
3773,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Surest and purest to preserve mankind
3774,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Against the monarch principle.”
3775,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3776,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Just then
3777,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A darkey came to bring him broth, he drank"
3778,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And I arose to go. He waved his hand
3779,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And asked me: “Would you like to hear about
3780,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,The book I plan to write?”
3781,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3782,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,I longed to stay
3783,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And hear him talk, but feared to tire him out."
3784,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I hinted this, he smiled a little smile"
3785,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And said: “If I’m alone, I think, and thought"
3786,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Without you talk it out is like a hopper
3787,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That is not emptied and may overflow,"
3788,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Or choke the grinding stones. Be seated, sir,"
3789,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,If you would please to listen.”
3790,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3791,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,So I stayed.
3792,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"When he had drunk the broth, he settled back"
3793,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To talk to me and tell me of his book,"
3794,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A sparhawk, as I said, with burning eyes!"
3795,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“First I will show the nature of the league,"
3796,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The compact, constitution, the republic"
3797,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Called federative even by Washington.
3798,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,I only sketch the plan to you. Take this:
3799,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"States make the Declaration, therefore states"
3800,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Existed at the time to make it. States
3801,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Signed up the Articles of Confederation
3802,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"In seventeen seventy-eight, and to what end?"
3803,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Why for ‘perpetual union.’ Was it so?
3804,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"No, nine years after, states, the very same"
3805,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Withdrew, seceded from ‘perpetual union’"
3806,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Under the Articles and acceded to,"
3807,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Ratified, what you will, the Constitution,"
3808,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And formed not a ‘perpetual union’ but
3809,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,`More perfect union.’
3810,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3811,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“If there is a man
3812,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Or ever was more gifted with the power
3813,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of cunning words that reach the heart than Lincoln,"
3814,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"I do not know him. Don’t you see it wins,"
3815,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Captures the swelling feelings to declare
3816,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The Union older than the states?--it’s false,"
3817,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,But Lincoln says it. Here’s another strain
3818,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,That moves the mob: ‘The Constitution has
3819,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"No word providing for its own destruction,"
3820,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,The ending of the government thereunder.’
3821,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"This Lincoln is a sophist, and in truth"
3822,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,With all this moral cry against the curse
3823,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Of slavery and these arguments of Lincoln
3824,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"We were put down, just as a hue and cry"
3825,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Will stifle Reason; but you can be sure
3826,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Reason will have her way and punishment
3827,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Will fall for her betrayal.
3828,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3829,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“Let us see:
3830,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,‘Was there provisions in the Articles
3831,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Of that perpetual union for the end
3832,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Of that perpetual union? Not at all!
3833,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,How did these states then end it? By seceding
3834,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To form a better one! Is there provision
3835,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"For getting out, withdrawing from the Union"
3836,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Formed by the Constitution? No! Why not?
3837,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Could not states do what they had done before,"
3838,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Leave ‘a more perfect union,’ as they left"
3839,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,‘Perpetual union?’ What’s a state in fact?
3840,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A state’s a sovereign, look in Vattell, look"
3841,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,In any great authority. So a sovereign
3842,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"May take back what it delegated, mark you,"
3843,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Not what it deeded, parted with, but only"
3844,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Delegated. In regard to that
3845,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,All powers not delegated were reserved.
3846,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Well, to resume, no word is in the charter"
3847,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To end the charter. And a contract has
3848,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"No word to end it by, how do you end it?"
3849,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"You end it by rescinding, when one party"
3850,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Has broken it. Is this a contract, compact?"
3851,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Even the mighty Webster said it was.
3852,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And further, if the Northern States, he said,"
3853,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Refuse to carry in effect the part
3854,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Respecting restoration of fugitive slaves,"
3855,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,The South would be no longer bound to keep--
3856,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"What did he say? the _compact_, that’s the word!"
3857,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Next then, what caused the war? I’ll show and prove"
3858,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"It was not slavery of the blacks, but slavery"
3859,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,The North would force on us. For seventy years
3860,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Fierce, bitter conflict waged between the forces"
3861,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of those who would maintain the Federal form,"
3862,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And those who would absorb in the Federal head
3863,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,All power of government; between the forces
3864,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of sovereignty in the people and control,"
3865,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And sovereignty in a central hand. Why, look,"
3866,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,No sooner was the perfect union formed
3867,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Than monarchists began to play their arts
3868,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Through tariffs, banks, assumption bills, the Act"
3869,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,That made the Federal Courts. And none of these
3870,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Had warrant in the charter; yet you see
3871,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,They overleaped its bounds. And so it was
3872,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To make all clear, explicit, when we framed"
3873,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"For these Confederate States our charter, we"
3874,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Forbade expressly tariffs, meant to foster"
3875,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Industrial adventures.
3876,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3877,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“No, my friend,"
3878,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Our slavery was not the cause of war.
3879,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,They would have Empire and the slavery
3880,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,That comes from it: unlicensed power to deal
3881,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"With fortunes, lives, economies and rights."
3882,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,We fought them in the Congress seventy years;
3883,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"We fought them at the hustings, with the ballot;"
3884,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And when they shouldered guns, we shouldered guns,"
3885,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And fought them to the last--now we have lost,"
3886,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And so I write my book.
3887,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3888,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“What is the difference
3889,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Between a mob, an army shouting God,"
3890,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Fired by a moral erethism fixed
3891,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"On slaughter for the triumph of its dream,"
3892,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,A riddance of its hate--what is the difference
3893,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Between an army like this and a man
3894,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Who dreams God moves, inspires him to an act"
3895,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Of foul assassination? None at all!
3896,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Why, there’s your Northern army shouting God,"
3897,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Your pure New England with its tariff spoils,"
3898,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Its banks and growing wealth, uplifting hands,"
3899,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Invoking God against us till they flame
3900,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A crazy party and a maddened army,"
3901,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To war upon us. But if slavery
3902,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Be sinful, where’s the word of Christ to say"
3903,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,That slavery is sinful? Not a word
3904,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,From him who scourged the Scribes and Pharisees
3905,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"For robbing widows’ houses, but no word"
3906,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Against the sin of slavery. Yet behold
3907,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,He found no faith in all of Israel
3908,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To equal that--of whom?--a man who owned
3909,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Slaves, as we did. I mean the Centurion."
3910,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And is this all? St. Paul who speaks for God
3911,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"With equal inspiration with New England,"
3912,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"As I should judge, enjoins the slaves to count"
3913,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Their masters worthy of all honor, that"
3914,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
3915,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3916,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“But
3917,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,If it be wrong to hold as property
3918,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A service, even a man to keep the service--"
3919,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Let us be clear and fair--then is it wrong
3920,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To hold indentures of apprenticeship?
3921,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And if, as Lincoln says, it is a right"
3922,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Given of God for every man to have,"
3923,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Eat if he will the bread he earns, then God"
3924,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Is blasphemed in the North where labor’s paid
3925,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Not what it earns, but what it must accept,"
3926,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Chained by necessity, and so enslaved."
3927,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And all these tariff laws are slavery
3928,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"By which my bread is taken, all the banks"
3929,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That profit by their issues, special rights,"
3930,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Enslave us, in the future will enslave"
3931,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Both North and South, when darkeys shall be free"
3932,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To choose their masters, but must choose, no less"
3933,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Take what the master hand consents to pay,"
3934,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And eat what bread is given. Yes, you know"
3935,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Our slavery was a gentle thing, belied"
3936,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"As bloody, sullen, selfish--yet you know"
3937,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"It was a gentle thing, a way to keep"
3938,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A race inferior in a place of work,"
3939,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Duly controlled. For once that race is freed
3940,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"It will go forth to mingle, mix and wed"
3941,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"With whites and claim equality, the ballot,"
3942,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Places of trust and profit, judgment seats."
3943,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Lincoln denies he favors this, no less"
3944,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,We’ll come to that. And all the while the mills
3945,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And factories in the North will bring to us
3946,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The helpless poor of Europe, and enslave them"
3947,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"By pauper wages, and enslave us all"
3948,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,With tariff-favored products. Slavery!
3949,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,God’s curse is on us for our Slavery!
3950,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,What do you think?
3951,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3952,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“They say we broke the law,"
3953,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Were rebels, insurrectionists; I’ll treat"
3954,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Those subjects in my book. But let us see,"
3955,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"They did not keep the law; they had their banks,"
3956,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"They had their tariffs, they infracted laws"
3957,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Respecting slaves who ran away, they joined"
3958,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Posses and leagues to break those laws, and we"
3959,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"In virtue of these breaches, were released"
3960,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"From this, the compact, just as Webster says."
3961,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Did Lincoln keep the law and keep his oath
3962,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The Constitution to support, obey?"
3963,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"He did not keep it, and he broke his oath."
3964,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Did he have lawful power to call the troops?
3965,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Did he have lawful warrant to blockade
3966,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Our southern ports? No one pretends he did.
3967,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,His Congress by a special act made valid
3968,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,These tyrant usurpations. Had he power
3969,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To strike the habeas corpus, gag the press?--"
3970,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,No power at all--he only seized the power
3971,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To reach what he conceived was all supreme,"
3972,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,The saving of the Union--more of this.
3973,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Well, then, what are these words: You break the law"
3974,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,On those who break it and confess they do?
3975,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"You have two ideas: Union and Secession,"
3976,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Or two republics made from one, that’s all."
3977,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And those who think secession criminal
3978,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Turn criminals themselves to stay the crime,"
3979,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And shout the Union. To this end I come,"
3980,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"This figment called the Union, which obsessed"
3981,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,The brain of Lincoln.
3982,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
3983,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“For the point is this,"
3984,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,You may take Truth or Liberty or Union
3985,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"For a battle cry, kill and be killed therefor,"
3986,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"But if our reasons rule, if we are men,"
3987,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,We take them at our peril. We must stake
3988,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Our souls upon the choice, be clear of mind"
3989,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That what we cry as Truth is Truth indeed,"
3990,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"That Liberty is Liberty, that the Union"
3991,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Is not a noun, a word, a subtlety,"
3992,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"But is a status, substance, living temple"
3993,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Reared from the bottom up on stones of fate,"
3994,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Predestined. Yet the truth is only this:
3995,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The Union is a noun and nothing more,"
3996,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And stands for what? A federative thing
3997,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Formed of the wills of states, not otherwise."
3998,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Existing; and to kill to save the Union
3999,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Is but the exercise of a hue and cry,"
4000,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"An arbitrary passion, sophist’s dream."
4001,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And Robespierre, who killed for liberty,"
4002,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And Cæsar, who destroyed the Roman liberties"
4003,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To have his way, are of the quality"
4004,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of Lincoln, whom I know. Take Robespierre,"
4005,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Was he not by a sense of justice moved,"
4006,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Pure, and as frigid as a bust of stone?"
4007,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And Cæsar had devoted friends, and Cæsar,"
4008,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The accomplished orator, general and scholar,"
4009,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Charming and gentle in his private walks,"
4010,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Destroyed the hopes of Rome.
4011,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
4012,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"“Now, mark me friend,"
4013,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,I do not think that Lincoln meant to crush
4014,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The institutions of his country--no,"
4015,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"His fault was this--the Union, yes the noun,"
4016,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Rose to religious mysticism, and enthralled"
4017,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,With sentiment his soul. And his ideas
4018,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of its formation, structure in his logic"
4019,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Rested upon a subtle solecism.
4020,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And for this noun, in spite of virtues great"
4021,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of head and heart, he used his other self,"
4022,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"His Cæsar self, his self of Robespierre,"
4023,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"In the great office which he exercised,"
4024,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"To bring us Oak Hill, Corinth, Fredericksburg."
4025,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Think you, if when he kept the store at Salem"
4026,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"A humble, studious man, he had been told"
4027,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"He would make wails of horror, wake the cries"
4028,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Of pestilence and famine in the camps,"
4029,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Bring devastation, rapine, fire and death--"
4030,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Had he been told this, he had said--‘My soul!"
4031,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Never,’ and with Hazael said, ‘Behold,"
4032,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?’"
4033,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Power changes men! And when the people give
4034,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Power or surrender it, they scarcely know"
4035,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"The thing they give, surrender."
4036,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,
4037,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,“But I ask
4038,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"What is there in the Union, what indeed"
4039,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,In any government’s supremacy
4040,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Or maintenance that justifies these acts--
4041,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"These horrors, slaughters--near a million men"
4042,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Slaughtered for what? The Union. Treasure spent
4043,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Beyond all counting for the Union. When
4044,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"No life had been destroyed, no dollar spent"
4045,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"If they had let us go, left us alone"
4046,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,To go our way. You see they did to us
4047,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"What England did; succeeded, where she failed."
4048,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And thus you see that human life is cheap,"
4049,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"And suffering a sequence when a dream,"
4050,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"An Idea takes a man, a mob, an army."
4051,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Which makes our life a jest, our boasted Reason"
4052,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,An instrument too weak for savagery.
4053,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Then for the rest--you see--I think you see.--”
4054,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,Sleep now was taking him. My little sparhawk
4055,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,"Was worn out, and his eyes began to droop,"
4056,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,His voice to fail him. In a moment then
4057,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,He sank down in his cloak and fell asleep--
4058,THE SPARROW HAWK IN THE RAIN,And I arose and left.

4109,ADELAIDE,"The patriot, move you so; and why not Brutus"
4110,ADELAIDE,As a soul made clear by Shakespeare for your Art

4151,BOOTH,"What is this trifling Art beside my country,"
4152,BOOTH,"This rhetoric spoken, memorized? My friend,"
4153,BOOTH,I would have given a thousand lives to see
4154,BOOTH,"My country whole, unbroken. Even now"
4155,BOOTH,"I’d give my life to see her what she was,"

4163,BOOTH,How I have loved that flag! How I have longed
4164,BOOTH,To see it flap free from the scarlet mist
4165,BOOTH,"That spoils its glory. As for me, this country"
4166,BOOTH,"Which I loved as a lover loves his bride,"
4167,BOOTH,"Seems now a dream! The South has all my love,"
4168,BOOTH,"What has it done? Withdrawn, and that alone,"
4169,BOOTH,From the Union which was formed by states withdrawing
4170,BOOTH,"From the old confederacy, and leaving states"
4171,BOOTH,Out in the cold that did not wish to join.
4172,BOOTH,What has the South done that it might not do
4173,BOOTH,Under the Declaration? Then to think
4174,BOOTH,"That all these tens of thousands of our kin,"
4175,BOOTH,"Our blood, our brothers, should be massacred"
4176,BOOTH,"For loving God and Liberty, serving God."

4178,BOOTH,"The negroes freed by what?--by force, by force"
4179,BOOTH,"Which John Brown used, and for the which he paid"
4180,BOOTH,"With his damned neck! O Reason! Adelaide,"
4181,BOOTH,"Of all men I am sanest, they are mad"
4182,BOOTH,Who cannot see these truths: that slavery
4183,BOOTH,"Is sanctioned by the Creator, read St. Paul;"
4184,BOOTH,"That men may revolutionize, as matter of right,"
4185,BOOTH,"Secede from what they have acceded to,"
4186,BOOTH,And not be murdered for it. Do you think
4187,BOOTH,"I have not measured motives, thoughts? My friend,"
4188,BOOTH,"I could be happy, if I could forget"
4189,BOOTH,"The duty laid upon me, have the means"
4190,BOOTH,"For happiness, so many friends and you,"
4191,BOOTH,"Great competence and fame, and greater fame"
4192,BOOTH,In store for deeper art. So much for this!
4193,BOOTH,"As for the South, as citizens, persons, love"
4194,BOOTH,"The South is not my friend. Then there’s my mother,"
4195,BOOTH,Whom I adore: See what I sacrifice:
4196,BOOTH,"Fame, money, friends, my mother--and for what?"
4197,BOOTH,"Were it the South, I should not think to act--"

4945,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,So this is what we bury? How his face
4946,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,Seems like a smear of yellow wax. This beard
4947,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"Grown fine and curly. Something nasty here,"
4948,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"Hermaphroditic, feminine. Like a dog"
4949,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"That has run loose with rabies, yelps and snaps,"

4952,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,So he lies here: this steadfast paranoic!
4953,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,How vanished from these sealed lids dreams of God!
4954,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,Where are they now? For all this outer world
4955,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"Of lunatics, care-takers, wardens, world"

4965,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,This Corbett slew the slayer in a faith

4977,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"To shoot the state assembly to a man,"
4978,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,When he was keeper of the door. Perhaps
4979,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"’Twas right enough to slay the actor Booth,"
4980,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,Obeying God; we might accept his word
4981,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,God told him to kill Booth. But was it God
4982,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,Commanded him to slay so many honorable
4983,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,Members of the Kansas legislature
4984,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"For legislating, or not legislating"
4985,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"As God would have them? Well, I have a doubt."
4986,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,And many doubted his divine appointment
4987,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,For massacre like that. And so we flung
4988,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"The lasso round him, gathered him, and quick"
4989,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"We shut him in the pound, dishonored God,"
4990,THE BURIAL OF BOSTON CORBETT,"As he conceived it, doing so."

5031,BUSINESS REVERSES,The prophet of Galilee.
5032,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5033,BUSINESS REVERSES,We two were there at Damascus
5034,BUSINESS REVERSES,Dealing in figs and wine.

5044,BUSINESS REVERSES,"There were crowds, and hungry, too."
5045,BUSINESS REVERSES,Five thousand stood in the desert
5046,BUSINESS REVERSES,And listened the whole day through.
5047,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5048,BUSINESS REVERSES,"Famished? Well, yes. The disciples"
5049,BUSINESS REVERSES,Were saying to send them away
5050,BUSINESS REVERSES,"To buy their bread in the village,"
5051,BUSINESS REVERSES,But the prophet went on to say:
5052,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5053,BUSINESS REVERSES,"“Feed them yourselves, O you"
5054,BUSINESS REVERSES,Of little faith.” But they said:
5055,BUSINESS REVERSES,“We have just five little fishes
5056,BUSINESS REVERSES,And two little loaves of bread.”
5057,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5058,BUSINESS REVERSES,"We heard it, me and Hipparch,"
5059,BUSINESS REVERSES,And rubbed our hands. You see
5060,BUSINESS REVERSES,We were there to make some money
5061,BUSINESS REVERSES,In the land of Galilee.
5062,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5063,BUSINESS REVERSES,We had stock in plenty. We waited.
5064,BUSINESS REVERSES,"I wiped the scales, and my chum"
5065,BUSINESS REVERSES,"Re-stacked the loaves. We bellowed,"
5066,BUSINESS REVERSES,But no one seemed to come.
5067,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5068,BUSINESS REVERSES,“Fresh fish!” I bawled my lungs out:
5069,BUSINESS REVERSES,"“Nice bread!” poor Hipparch cried,"
5070,BUSINESS REVERSES,But what did they do? Sat down there
5071,BUSINESS REVERSES,"In fifties, side by side,"
5072,BUSINESS REVERSES,"In ranks, the whole five thousand."
5073,BUSINESS REVERSES,"Then--well, the prophet spoke,"
5074,BUSINESS REVERSES,"And broke the five little fishes,"
5075,BUSINESS REVERSES,And the two little loaves he broke.
5076,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5077,BUSINESS REVERSES,And fed the whole five thousand.
5078,BUSINESS REVERSES,"Why, yes! So gorged they slept."
5079,BUSINESS REVERSES,And we stood beaten and bankrupt.
5080,BUSINESS REVERSES,Poor Hipparch swore and wept.
5081,BUSINESS REVERSES,
5082,BUSINESS REVERSES,They gathered up twelve baskets
5083,BUSINESS REVERSES,Full from the loaves of bread;
5084,BUSINESS REVERSES,Five little fishes--twelve baskets

5116,THE FIG TREE,"Soldiers of Cæsar saw me and ate of my tree, nor drew"
5117,THE FIG TREE,"Ax nor sword to the branches, nor even a hack on the bole."
5118,THE FIG TREE,Now what had I done or my tree? I call it an evil dole
5119,THE FIG TREE,
5120,THE FIG TREE,To a tree that must rest as a man rests. Why last year what a crop!
5121,THE FIG TREE,"Figs all over the branches, from lower limb to top."

5141,THE FIG TREE,"He ran to my tree expectant, saw nothing but leaves thereon."
5142,THE FIG TREE,"Then raged for the lack of figs, no grace for the years that it bore."
5143,THE FIG TREE,And he said may no fruit grow hereon forevermore.
5144,THE FIG TREE,
5145,THE FIG TREE,With that my tree curled up like a leaf in a windy blaze.
5146,THE FIG TREE,I was standing here on my step half blind in a sudden maze.
5147,THE FIG TREE,"Then he said: have faith and do what I have done to this tree,"
5148,THE FIG TREE,Or say to the mountains move and be cast into the sea.
5149,THE FIG TREE,
5150,THE FIG TREE,"So now I have no shade at noon under leafy boughs,"
5151,THE FIG TREE,"Why the tree was good for resting, cooler than in the house,"
5152,THE FIG TREE,"If it never bore again, if the life is more than meat"
5153,THE FIG TREE,"Why not this tree for my dreams, though he found no figs to eat."
5154,THE FIG TREE,
5155,THE FIG TREE,"But I swear it had borne next year, it was only taking a rest."
5156,THE FIG TREE,There’s too many saints who are straining the world to a dream
5157,THE FIG TREE,in the breast.
5158,THE FIG TREE,"Next year no figs for Cæsar, and none for myself, what’s worse,"

5240,THE GREAT MERGER,And now at last is the worst:

5420,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"And already with child,"
5421,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5422,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Before they had come to each other,"

5426,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5427,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"The witnesses, judge her and make her"
5428,THE SINGLE STANDARD,A noise and a shame--
5429,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"We knew this, and what would he do"
5430,THE SINGLE STANDARD,If the case were the same
5431,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5432,THE SINGLE STANDARD,As his father believed was the case
5433,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"With his mother? would he,"
5434,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"A prophet, fulfill all the law,"

5436,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5437,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"This Sarah, you know, that I caught,"
5438,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Was a witness and saw.
5439,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Now what would he do, shade away,"
5440,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Or judge by the law?
5441,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5442,THE SINGLE STANDARD,For Moses decreed if a woman
5443,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Who is married shall lie
5444,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"With a man, whether wedded or not,"
5445,THE SINGLE STANDARD,The woman shall die
5446,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5447,THE SINGLE STANDARD,With the man in a volley of stones;

5449,THE SINGLE STANDARD,If a virgin already betrothed
5450,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Shall lust in the deed
5451,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5452,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"With a man not the bridegroom, and whether"
5453,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"The man shall be wed,"
5454,THE SINGLE STANDARD,The people shall stone them with stones
5455,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Until they be dead.
5456,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5457,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Now mark you, how equal the law"
5458,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Of weight and of span:
5459,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"One law for the woman in sin,"
5460,THE SINGLE STANDARD,The same for the man.
5461,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5462,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"If Moses be still the law-giver,"
5463,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"By nothing dethroned,"
5464,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"And this be the law, then this Sarah"
5465,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Was fit to be stoned.
5466,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5467,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"And if it be true, as he says,"
5468,THE SINGLE STANDARD,That he came to fulfill
5469,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"The law, nor destroy it, why then"
5470,THE SINGLE STANDARD,We thought he would will
5471,THE SINGLE STANDARD,The death of this woman we took
5472,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"In adultery, yes in the act,"
5473,THE SINGLE STANDARD,So we argued together beforehand
5474,THE SINGLE STANDARD,The law and the fact.
5475,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5476,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Now the case was this way: this Josiah
5477,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Late journeyed from Tyre,"
5478,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Three wives to his household already,"
5479,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Yet alive with desire,"
5480,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5481,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And free by our custom and law
5482,THE SINGLE STANDARD,To add to his hearth
5483,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"A fourth for the heirs to his house,"
5484,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"And for comfort and mirth,"
5485,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5486,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Came back in the cause of a field
5487,THE SINGLE STANDARD,He had bought; as it chanced
5488,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Met up with this Sarah, a wife,"
5489,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"They feasted and danced,"
5490,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5491,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Her spouse being absent, what’s more"
5492,THE SINGLE STANDARD,In Egypt for good.
5493,THE SINGLE STANDARD,So Josiah and Sarah were found
5494,THE SINGLE STANDARD,In the act in the wood.
5495,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5496,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"We brought her before him, accused,"
5497,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And told him the case.
5498,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"He stooped, as it seemed, to conceal"
5499,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"A blush on his face,"
5500,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"And wrote in the sand, as we stood"
5501,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And pressed him he wrote:
5502,THE SINGLE STANDARD,“Anise” and “cummin” and “gnat”
5503,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And “Moses” and “mote.”
5504,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5505,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"We cried all the more, he uplifted"
5506,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Himself, said: “Begin"
5507,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Your throwing of stones, let the first"
5508,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Be him without sin.”
5509,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5510,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"So there I was caught, for he knew--"
5511,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Like wheat from the scythe
5512,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"We shrank--I was guilty of sin,"
5513,THE SINGLE STANDARD,I had failed in my tithe
5514,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5515,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Of anise. But why have clean hands
5516,THE SINGLE STANDARD,To work at our smudges?
5517,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And how will you ever stop sin
5518,THE SINGLE STANDARD,If you ask of the judges
5519,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5520,THE SINGLE STANDARD,To be without sin ere they punish
5521,THE SINGLE STANDARD,A matter of lust?
5522,THE SINGLE STANDARD,I call this a ruling where morals
5523,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Fall down in the dust.
5524,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5525,THE SINGLE STANDARD,The most of us left then. He asked her:
5526,THE SINGLE STANDARD,“Does no man condemn?
5527,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Nor do I.” And so he made one
5528,THE SINGLE STANDARD,With me and with them.
5529,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5530,THE SINGLE STANDARD,So here in a sense was the world
5531,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Spiritual, civil,"
5532,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Prophet and Pharisee, judge"
5533,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Leagued up with the devil.
5534,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5535,THE SINGLE STANDARD,For what did it matter to say
5536,THE SINGLE STANDARD,To go and no more
5537,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"Sin as she had, if the sin"
5538,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Would fare as before?
5539,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5540,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"It followed that Sarah went free,"
5541,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And Josiah the man.
5542,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"One standard for both is the rule,"
5543,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And the modern plan.
5544,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5545,THE SINGLE STANDARD,What’s that? Why to sin if you wish--
5546,THE SINGLE STANDARD,For what is a sin
5547,THE SINGLE STANDARD,If no stones are hurled for the lack
5548,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Of a man to begin?
5549,THE SINGLE STANDARD,
5550,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And so it all ended. This Sarah
5551,THE SINGLE STANDARD,Was given a bill.
5552,THE SINGLE STANDARD,"She married Josiah, they say,"
5553,THE SINGLE STANDARD,And lives with him still.

5623,FIRST ENTRANTS,Without pretense or pride. We are children

5643,JOHN IN PRISON,"(_St. Luke, Chapter XVI. St. Matthew, Chapter XI._)"
5644,JOHN IN PRISON,
5645,JOHN IN PRISON,
5646,JOHN IN PRISON,John said to the jailer: “Where are my disciples? Befriend
5647,JOHN IN PRISON,"My grief and my doubt, and entreat them to come, to the end"
5648,JOHN IN PRISON,
5649,JOHN IN PRISON,"That they ask him for me if we look for another, or deem,"
5650,JOHN IN PRISON,"As I did, that this prophet shall save and fulfill and redeem.”"
5651,JOHN IN PRISON,
5652,JOHN IN PRISON,And the jailer replied: “Since the wrath of King Herod a dish
5653,JOHN IN PRISON,"Your head shall contain by to-morrow, I give you your wish.”"
5654,JOHN IN PRISON,
5655,JOHN IN PRISON,So he brought the disciples to John and the two of them led
5656,JOHN IN PRISON,"To the cell where he sat, and John to the two of them said:--"
5657,JOHN IN PRISON,
5658,JOHN IN PRISON,"“At this end of my life and my hopes, at the door of my doom"
5659,JOHN IN PRISON,"Go ask him for me and report: is it he that should come,"
5660,JOHN IN PRISON,
5661,JOHN IN PRISON,Or shall we yet look for another?” Amazed were the two
5662,JOHN IN PRISON,And one of them spoke to the Baptist and said: “Is it true
5663,JOHN IN PRISON,
5664,JOHN IN PRISON,That you preached in the wilderness saying repent and prepare
5665,JOHN IN PRISON,"The way of the Lord, whose shoes I am worthless to bear;"
5666,JOHN IN PRISON,
5667,JOHN IN PRISON,"Who will fan out the chaff, gather wheat, purge the floor"
5668,JOHN IN PRISON,"With fire and the Spirit baptize you, bring down and restore"
5669,JOHN IN PRISON,
5670,JOHN IN PRISON,The kingdom of heaven? And are we abused in the word
5671,JOHN IN PRISON,That as he came out of the waters of Jordan you heard
5672,JOHN IN PRISON,
5673,JOHN IN PRISON,A voice call from heaven which thundered: ‘This son of my love
5674,JOHN IN PRISON,"With whom I am pleased you shall hear,’ and a dove"
5675,JOHN IN PRISON,
5676,JOHN IN PRISON,For the Spirit descended upon him--and yet can you ask
5677,JOHN IN PRISON,If he be the one that should come? Yet we take up the
5678,JOHN IN PRISON,task
5679,JOHN IN PRISON,
5680,JOHN IN PRISON,And go at your bidding.” And John said: “I suffer without
5681,JOHN IN PRISON,"You seek him and ask, for this is the cause of my doubt:--"
5682,JOHN IN PRISON,
5683,JOHN IN PRISON,I have heard of his works and rejoice. But why does he feast
5684,JOHN IN PRISON,When I fasted myself? And how have the rumors increased
5685,JOHN IN PRISON,
5686,JOHN IN PRISON,"That he fellows with publicans, sinners and drinkers of wine,"
5687,JOHN IN PRISON,"A bibber himself, when the springs of the desert were mine?"
5688,JOHN IN PRISON,
5689,JOHN IN PRISON,"And how is the ax, as I said, laid close to the root of the tree,"
5690,JOHN IN PRISON,"And my curses fulfilled of the Pharisees, if this must be?"
5691,JOHN IN PRISON,
5692,JOHN IN PRISON,"And if, as they say, he is preaching the word that we make"
5693,JOHN IN PRISON,Of the unrighteous mammon a friend for the day when we break
5694,JOHN IN PRISON,
5695,JOHN IN PRISON,"With the lords of the riches of truth, as he put it, for then"
5696,JOHN IN PRISON,"The unrighteous mammon shall take us, console us again:--"
5697,JOHN IN PRISON,
5698,JOHN IN PRISON,I have wasted the goods of my lord! I am caught and accused!
5699,JOHN IN PRISON,Shall I make good the theft from my lord in a trust I abused?
5700,JOHN IN PRISON,
5701,JOHN IN PRISON,"Why, no! I go out to the debtors, my master to foil,"
5702,JOHN IN PRISON,"How much do you owe him? Why, so many measures of oil!"
5703,JOHN IN PRISON,
5704,JOHN IN PRISON,"Sit down then, I say, make the bill but a half, quickly write:--"
5705,JOHN IN PRISON,"I am wiser in this, so he says, than the children of light--"
5706,JOHN IN PRISON,
5707,JOHN IN PRISON,"As I make for myself by the trick of a thief, and a theft,"
5708,JOHN IN PRISON,The confederates’ home for my own for my honor bereft.
5709,JOHN IN PRISON,
5710,JOHN IN PRISON,Go! learn if he said this. Return ere the rise of the sun:--
5711,JOHN IN PRISON,"Shall we look for another to save us, or is he the one?”"

5719,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Who is that coming? Look! They are bearing a body again.
5720,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"It’s a woman now, I think. And the very same young men"
5721,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5722,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Who brought Ananias’ body we buried a moment ago.
5723,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Pat down the earth a little, the grass will sooner grow."
5724,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5725,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Yes, now I see it’s Sapphira. What did she do to win"
5726,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Death at the hands of Peter, or was it her husband’s sin?"
5727,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5728,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"To which she agreed, or kept her husband’s secret in faith."
5729,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"They sold a sheep, as I hear it, and suffered sudden death"
5730,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5731,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"For hiding part of the price, for a thing commendable:"
5732,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Their boy is sick, and they needed money to get him well."
5733,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5734,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Just look how things are going: Cæsar the despot rules,"
5735,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"The state is his. For the rest, we are run by a pack of fools;"
5736,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5737,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Zealots and mystics who say that the end of the world is near.
5738,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Tyranny around us, on top, under us dullness and fear."
5739,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5740,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Songs and the wine-cup banished, freedom throttled blue."
5741,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"It’s the same here being a Greek, Persian, Median, Jew."
5742,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5743,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Roman sovereignty over us, merciless, cold and bright."
5744,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Fogs over the land of dust, day no different than night."
5745,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5746,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Listless we labor or idle, creep into an early bed."
5747,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Sleep is the best thing now, and the best is the sleep of the dead."

5751,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5752,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Put everything in common. That’s one cry. What remains?
5753,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Taxes, soldiers, prisons, edicts, laws and chains."
5754,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5755,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,There never was such a time! What man is lord of his soul?
5756,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Someone entered my barn and took my ass with foal
5757,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5758,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"For the prophet to ride on in triumph. I was there and saw him ride,"
5759,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Crowds crying hallelujah pressing on every side.
5760,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5761,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"They would have all things in common. They kill a man and his wife,"
5762,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"And Cæsar rules as always, and yet they call this life!"
5763,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5764,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Wars forever and ever, manned by hovels and huts;"
5765,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"And what is it all about? lands, and gold and guts;"
5766,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5767,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"And baptists stirring the dreamers, and bankers that thrive thereby."
5768,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Why kill off Ananias when the whole of life is a lie?
5769,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5770,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"All right, young men, put her down. Go to it now with the spade."
5771,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,We’ll bury the woman Sapphira here where her husband’s laid.
5772,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5773,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,They’re out of it. Neither Cæsar nor Peter can wake their sleep.
5774,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"I lost my ass, and they lost their lives for the price of a sheep."
5775,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5776,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,And Cæsar will rule forever! And Peter if he grows strong
5777,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Will make a pact with Cæsar, and Israel’s woe and wrong"
5778,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5779,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,Will spread all over the earth. It takes no prophet to see
5780,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,That while there is Gold and Fear man will never be free--
5781,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,
5782,ANANIAS AND SAPPHIRA,"Until the world is fed, and hunger steals like a wraith"

5789,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5790,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5791,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Ask Matthew, or ask Mark, and get the truth."
5792,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"I know myself, was there and heard them both--"
5793,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Both railed at him. No! one did not rebuke
5794,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The other for his railing; did not ask
5795,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,To be remembered when into his Kingdom
5796,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Jesus should come. What kingdom? David’s?--pah!
5797,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,That had gone whirling with the desert’s dust.
5798,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,What kingdom? That within you? A fool’s kingdom!
5799,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"“To-day thou shalt be with me in Paradise,”"
5800,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He never said that. I was there. I know.
5801,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And if he did, where is that paradise?"
5802,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Where is he? And where is the man they say
5803,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"He said this to? Ask Matthew, learn the truth:"
5804,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Both railed at him. Both died, nerved to the last"
5805,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,By bitter disappointment.
5806,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5807,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Listen, friend,"
5808,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"These malefactors were my brothers! Well,"
5809,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,I saw them grow up lusty. I beheld
5810,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Their course from hope to action, till defeat"
5811,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And prison took them.
5812,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5813,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"For we are the sons,"
5814,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"We Jews, of those who went to Babylon;"
5815,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Returned to fall by Alexander’s sword;
5816,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Were snatched by Syria, then Egypt came,"
5817,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Put heels upon our necks. Rome sailed to us,"
5818,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And took us over. And these bitter years
5819,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Made poets, prophets of us, spurred us on"
5820,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,To inflate the dream Jehovah with our breath
5821,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Of threats and curses; yet these bitter years
5822,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Kept at white heat the hope of David’s throne,"
5823,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Restored, triumphant, and our prophecies"
5824,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Were from Jehovah of a king to come
5825,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Who would free Israel, drive the oppressor off,"
5826,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And let us live as men.
5827,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5828,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Now it may be
5829,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"A certain Jacob was his grandfather,"
5830,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,As Matthew says; or it may be that Heli
5831,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Was his grandfather, as Luke says, but still"
5832,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Both say he was of David. And Luke says
5833,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The angel Gabriel came to Mary, his mother,"
5834,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And said he shall be great and shall be called
5835,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The Son of the Most High, and God shall give him"
5836,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The throne of his father David. He shall reign
5837,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Over the house of Jacob, and his kingdom"
5838,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Shall have no end. We looked for such a one
5839,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"To free us and with portents such as stars,"
5840,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And Gabriel descending, Bethlehem"
5841,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Become his birth-place, and the prophecies"
5842,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Of old fulfilled, we looked for Israel freed,"
5843,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And for a king of Jewish blood to rule us--
5844,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,No Cæsar any more. For it was prophesied
5845,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Of Bethlehem: For out of thee shall come
5846,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"A governor, a shepherd of my people!"
5847,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And look, he’s born in Bethlehem! And why not"
5848,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Our hope re-kindled?
5849,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5850,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And now look at us;
5851,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"These centuries bruised, imprisoned and made poor,"
5852,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Jerusalem a city of wails and woes,"
5853,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The whole of Israel slaved! And look at him!
5854,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"How does he start his work, whatever it be?"
5855,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,By reading from Isaiah at Nazareth:--
5856,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"“The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because"
5857,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He anointed me to preach good tidings to
5858,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The poor, hath sent me to proclaim release"
5859,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,To captives and to set at liberty
5860,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Them that are bruised.”
5861,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5862,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"What doctrine may this be,"
5863,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"But change, or revolution, and the ferment"
5864,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Of new wine bursting bottles frail and old,"
5865,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"This tyranny of Cæsar, this dependence"
5866,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,On alien rulership? You know yourself
5867,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Barabbas was not single in the crime
5868,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Of insurrection, ask the fellow Mark."
5869,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He’ll tell you this Barabbas lay in bonds
5870,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"With many who rose up, committed murder."
5871,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Of these were my two brothers, crucified"
5872,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,With Jesus on that day.
5873,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5874,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Well, so it was"
5875,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"He preached, was followed by the poor, the weak,"
5876,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The slaved, despoiled until ’twas noised abroad"
5877,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Through all the hill country and in the cities
5878,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"That he stirred up the people everywhere,"
5879,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Devising revolution, overthrow"
5880,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Of Cæsar’s rule. But there was murmuring too:
5881,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"For some said he was good, and others said"
5882,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He deceived the people. For upon a day
5883,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"When he was asked directly of our tribute,"
5884,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Whether to pay to Cæsar, not to pay,"
5885,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He dodged and said: “Give Cæsar his due and God
5886,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"His due”; but what we wished to know, was what"
5887,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Was Cæsar’s due, and give it him, and if"
5888,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"No tribute was his due, but rather casting"
5889,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The yoke of Cæsar, then give Cæsar that."
5890,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"He did not answer what the Pharisees asked,"
5891,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"That which _we_ wished to hear him answer, though"
5892,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The Pharisees had asked him. For we poor,"
5893,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Enslaved and disinherited had followed
5894,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,His leadership thus far.
5895,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5896,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Behold the change:
5897,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Passing from work unfinished he becomes
5898,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The Son of God and God himself, becomes"
5899,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"A mystery, the Word that lived and wrought"
5900,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Before John who announced him. Tidings preached,"
5901,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"I grant you, to the poor, but who remain"
5902,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Poor as before, but worn for broken hope"
5903,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Of words that changed no thing. And no release
5904,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"To captives, and no liberty to those"
5905,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Bruised and in chains. And so I say his work
5906,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Is left unfinished, nothing done in truth."
5907,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And quickly, like a sun-rise on the hills,"
5908,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"He flashes forth his God-head, and we’re left"
5909,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"To Cæsar’s will, and end up with the words:--"
5910,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"His kingdom is of heaven, not of earth;"
5911,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Refines the point: this kingdom is within us.
5912,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And he will die and rise again from death,"
5913,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Ascend to heaven, and return again"
5914,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Before this generation passes to take up
5915,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"His own to heaven, and will rule forever"
5916,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"In heaven, not in Israel. For the world"
5917,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Is to be burnt, with all its disbelievers."
5918,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And when it’s burnt, sitting at God’s right hand"
5919,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He’ll rule forever with his own! You see
5920,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"What we expected vanished in such words,"
5921,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Such madness, idle dreams."
5922,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5923,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"But, as I said,"
5924,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"His lineage was David’s; Matthew, Mark"
5925,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Will tell you so. But David said of Christ,"
5926,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Calling him Lord; sit thou on my right hand
5927,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Till I make enemies of thine thy foot-stool.
5928,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"“How is Christ son of David, being his Lord?”"
5929,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Asked Jesus of the Pharisees, closed their mouths"
5930,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,With asking that. The common people heard
5931,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Him gladly when he said this--true enough!
5932,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"But I, my brothers, did not hear him gladly."
5933,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"For if he were the son of God, yet equal"
5934,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"In being and in time with God, why not"
5935,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The son and lord of David? Both perplex
5936,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The spirit of man; one mystery is as dark
5937,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"As another mystery, and if one be so, then"
5938,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Another may be also. Pass the point....
5939,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5940,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,They crucified my brothers with him! Both
5941,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Railed on him for deliverance from the cross.
5942,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"If he were God, he could have plucked the nails"
5943,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And let them down, escape. And listen now:"
5944,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"My brothers kept their faith in him to the last,"
5945,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And since they were condemned and had to pay
5946,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"For insurrection on the cross, chose out"
5947,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,His day of crucifixion for their own;
5948,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Believed that he would save them, and so make"
5949,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,This choosing of his time of penalty
5950,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,An hour of luck. And so I tell you truth:
5951,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Though both were railing it was rather pain
5952,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Than lack of hope that made them rail at him.
5953,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Nor was it mockery that made them rail.
5954,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"They hoped to stir him by their words, evoke"
5955,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,His greatest strength to help them that they railed.
5956,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,They even smiled a little when the nails
5957,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Were driven through their hands, as if to say:"
5958,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,“You cannot harm us when this god is here;
5959,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Go, do your butcher business, for at last"
5960,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,He’ll save himself and us.” And just as men
5961,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Refuse to think death near, and still believe"
5962,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"They will escape it somehow, when no aid,"
5963,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"But human hands is near, my brothers thought"
5964,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"This god would surely save them. So they talked,"
5965,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Hunched up their legs and shoulders to ease up
5966,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The strain of hanging on the nails, and waited,"
5967,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Joked with the lookers on, and smiled and begged,"
5968,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And sweated agony and railed at last.
5969,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,But when the voices in the crowd called out:
5970,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"“If you trust God, let God deliver you,"
5971,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"If you are God’s son, let Him save you now;"
5972,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Save thou thyself!” my older brother said:
5973,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"“If I were off this cross I’d break your heads,"
5974,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"You crooked priests, you whited sepulchers,"
5975,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,You carrion Scribes and Pharisees.”
5976,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
5977,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And such noise
5978,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"As they cast lots to get his garments, shouts"
5979,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,When they were won and parted! In a silence
5980,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"He asked his Father to forgive them, saying"
5981,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,They knew not what they did. My brother bawled:
5982,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"“They know what they are doing, they have killed"
5983,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The prophets in all ages! Don’t say that!
5984,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Don’t end up soft, you cursed them hitherto,"
5985,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,These are the vipers that you cursed before;
5986,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,These are the vultures that you said you’d shut
5987,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,The gates of heaven against; these are the wolves
5988,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"That thirst for blood and lap it, unrepentant"
5989,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Blasphemers against you and the Holy Ghost;
5990,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Committers of unpardonable sins, the band"
5991,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,You drove with knotted cords from out the temple.
5992,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And what is usury or selling doves
5993,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,To killing you? Why ask your Father this?
5994,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Why now this softness? Change of mood, why prayers"
5995,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Instead of curses? If you’re dying, sire,"
5996,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Be what you were when you were flush with life,"
5997,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And curse them into hell. Hold to your strength,"
5998,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And curse them into hell.” And so it went
5999,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"With talking back and forth, mixed in with groans,"
6000,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And curses, railings, while my brothers twisted"
6001,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Their bodies, and hunched up their thighs and backs"
6002,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"To ease the strain of hanging on the nails,"
6003,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And dribbled at the mouth, and babbled things"
6004,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And laughed like devils in a soul possessed.
6005,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
6006,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,But when he thirsted and they took a sponge
6007,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And gave him vinegar, and he sucked it in,"
6008,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,They looked at him with eyes that bulged with fear:--
6009,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"They saw him drooping, fainting, losing strength,"
6010,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,They struggled then and shouted: “Keep on breathing!
6011,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Breathe deep! Call on your Father! Don’t give up!
6012,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Fight for your life, your god-head and ourselves!"
6013,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"We’re here because you came and preached, and stirred"
6014,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"The people! Don’t desert us now! Great Lord,"
6015,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Messiah, Son of God, are we first martyrs"
6016,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"To what you failed to do? We cannot die,"
6017,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,You must not die. Let David’s throne be lost
6018,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"As lost it is, but not our lives! Great Lord!”"
6019,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Thus as they chattered, chattered, bawled and shouted"
6020,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Jesus threw back his head and cried so loud
6021,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"That all the valleys echoed it: “My God,"
6022,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"My God, why hast thou forsaken me?” And then"
6023,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,His head dropped on his chest--and he was dead....
6024,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
6025,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"They looked at him--my brothers looked at him,"
6026,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And whimpered--they were beaten, but fought on."
6027,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Tears stained with blood went coursing down their cheeks.
6028,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And then the soldiers came to break their legs.
6029,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"And one had fainted, but the other one"
6030,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Was fighting still and said: “Have mercy friend,"
6031,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Cæsar would save me, what does Cæsar care"
6032,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,For one poor rebel?”
6033,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,
6034,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,"Then they broke their legs,"
6035,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,And all were dead. So ended up another
6036,THE TWO MALEFACTORS,Chapter in this poor world’s hopeless hope.

6061,BERENICE,Is desecrated.

6063,FESTUS,FESTUS
6064,FESTUS,
6065,FESTUS,How to firmly keep

6067,FESTUS,That is the problem. Where the state and god
6068,FESTUS,"Are one, inseparable, can Cæsar rule"
6069,FESTUS,And not subject their god? There was this Judas
6070,FESTUS,Together with a Pharisee named Sadduk
6071,FESTUS,"Who fought the Roman census of the Jews,"
6072,FESTUS,"Raised revolution in religion’s name,"
6073,FESTUS,A cunning strategy. You could not crush
6074,FESTUS,"The revolution, leave their faith unharmed."
6075,FESTUS,And now this new sect called the Nazarenes--

6084,BERENICE,
6085,BERENICE,I have heard the desert
6086,BERENICE,Fosters a little burr of poisonous spines
6087,BERENICE,"Which sometimes as the lion roams the sands,"
6088,BERENICE,Sticks in the hairy clefts between his claws.
6089,BERENICE,"It itches, stings, and maddens; with a growl"
6090,BERENICE,The lion lays him down and with his tongue
6091,BERENICE,Licks out the pest. It sticks upon his tongue.
6092,BERENICE,He has no second tongue to lick it thence.
6093,BERENICE,It sticks and stings. The poison spreads apace
6094,BERENICE,And puffs the rebelling member till his throat
6095,BERENICE,"Narrows for breath. And then he runs and roars,"
6096,BERENICE,"And with his nose plows through the sand, lies down,"
6097,BERENICE,"Digs in the desert, leaps, rolls over, froths,"
6098,BERENICE,Grows green of eye; chokes to his death at last.
6099,BERENICE,"Rome is your lion, and the burr these Jews."

6112,BERENICE,Jesus they killed and Stephen. But should Rome
6113,BERENICE,"Repress religions, doctrines, script or speech?"
6114,BERENICE,"If what they teach be false ’twill die, if true"
6115,BERENICE,You cannot kill it.

6122,AGRIPPA,But thickets bear no apples. Apple trees
6123,AGRIPPA,"Fall easily to the ax. And so with truth,"
6124,AGRIPPA,And false truth. Where you have one man who’s wise
6125,AGRIPPA,"You have a million fools, who take the stones"

6136,FESTUS,"Offenses numerous against him, such"
6137,FESTUS,"As breaches of the Jewish law, attacks"
6138,FESTUS,"Upon their temple, on the emperor,"
6139,FESTUS,"Contemned perhaps, the which they could not prove."
6140,FESTUS,"Now to report to you, O King, my judgment"
6141,FESTUS,Divided in the case of Paul. I sought
6142,FESTUS,To do the Jews a pleasure. So I asked:
6143,FESTUS,Will you go to Jerusalem and be judged?
6144,FESTUS,"But Paul replied: I stand at Cæsar’s seat,"
6145,FESTUS,There should my judgment be.
6146,FESTUS,
6147,AGRIPPA,AGRIPPA

6149,AGRIPPA,"O, wicked Rome,"

6153,FESTUS,FESTUS
6154,FESTUS,
6155,FESTUS,"Yes, I told these Jews"
6156,FESTUS,Rome does not give a man to die before
6157,FESTUS,"He meets his accusers face to face, has time"
6158,FESTUS,To answer for himself. And so it was
6159,FESTUS,"I came to Cæsarea, had him brought"
6160,FESTUS,"And heard the case. As I supposed, they charged"
6161,FESTUS,"This Paul with nothing, only matters raised"
6162,FESTUS,"Of their own superstitions, and of Jesus"
6163,FESTUS,"Whom Paul affirmed, affirms to be alive,"
6164,FESTUS,Though dead long since. But as he had appealed
6165,FESTUS,To Cæsar I commanded he be kept
6166,FESTUS,Till I might send him. But what shall I say?
6167,FESTUS,"How shall I send him, after all, to Cæsar"
6168,FESTUS,Without a writing that shall signify
6169,FESTUS,Why and for what I send him? Cæsar’s time
6170,FESTUS,Is not for crimeless causes.
6171,FESTUS,
6172,AGRIPPA,AGRIPPA
6173,AGRIPPA,
6174,AGRIPPA,Nevertheless
6175,AGRIPPA,As he’s appealed to Cæsar he must go.
6176,AGRIPPA,But I would hear him.
6177,AGRIPPA,
6178,FESTUS,FESTUS
6179,FESTUS,
6180,FESTUS,I have sent for him
6181,FESTUS,"That you may hear him. There, he enters now!"
6182,FESTUS,
6183,FESTUS,(_Paul is brought in._)
6184,FESTUS,
6185,FESTUS,He has a speech that he has often made
6186,FESTUS,"How first he persecuted, for in truth Agrippa"
6187,FESTUS,He is a catapult that has sprung up
6188,FESTUS,As far as he was pulled the other way.
6189,FESTUS,"And he will tell you how he stoned this Stephen,"
6190,FESTUS,And hunted Nazarenes: and how he went
6191,FESTUS,With writs of persecution from the priests
6192,FESTUS,"Up to Damascus, on the way saw light"
6193,FESTUS,"From heaven, heard the voice of Jesus cry"
6194,FESTUS,"That he should be a minister to the faith,"
6195,FESTUS,And preach as he had persecuted. You see
6196,FESTUS,"The rebound of nature, mind."

6200,BERENICE,"How thin,"

6202,BERENICE,Confine him to the matter of this god
6203,BERENICE,"Who died, and from the dead arose. O Death,"
6204,BERENICE,"You are man’s horror, and we brood upon you,"
6205,BERENICE,Our altars are placations to your wrath.
6206,BERENICE,"This Paul is mad for thinking of you, mad"
6207,BERENICE,With faith that he has conquered you. Look there!
6208,BERENICE,See how his eyes are staring bright as fire--
6209,BERENICE,I am afraid. And yet if it were true
6210,BERENICE,"Jesus arose, nay if the world could be"
6211,BERENICE,"Persuaded that he rose, the faith would sweep"
6212,BERENICE,"The world with fire, and crumble every temple"
6213,BERENICE,And altar of our gods in almighty Rome.
6214,BERENICE,Look how he stares!
6215,BERENICE,
6216,AGRIPPA,AGRIPPA
6217,AGRIPPA,
6218,AGRIPPA,"There is a noble madness,"
6219,AGRIPPA,A madness which has slaved nobility
6220,AGRIPPA,And energy and eloquence. Say now
6221,AGRIPPA,Who saw this Jesus after he arose?
6222,AGRIPPA,Did Paul? Who saw him?
6223,AGRIPPA,
6224,FESTUS,FESTUS
6225,FESTUS,
6226,FESTUS,No one that I know.

6230,AGRIPPA,AGRIPPA
6231,AGRIPPA,
6232,AGRIPPA,Where are they?
6233,AGRIPPA,Bring one to me. Bring Peter; bring a woman.
6234,AGRIPPA,This is the cause I’d hear. And if this Paul
6235,AGRIPPA,"Can bring me witness, though his crime were great"
6236,AGRIPPA,"As Hannibal’s on Rome, I’ll set him free."
6237,AGRIPPA,Why look at him! Is this new matter to me?
6238,AGRIPPA,Is he the first who for the gods went mad?
6239,AGRIPPA,Or for the mystery of life went mad?
6240,AGRIPPA,"Or madness took for what we are and why,"
6241,AGRIPPA,And what this life means? For this world has seen
6242,AGRIPPA,A perfect harmony and working thought
6243,AGRIPPA,And inspiration in a thousand minds
6244,AGRIPPA,"Of madness on some matter. Fellow, come"
6245,AGRIPPA,"Close here before me. Look at me. Yes, well,"
6246,AGRIPPA,"There is the light of rising suns, and stars"

6416,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,First attend:
6417,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"What would the gods, the god Jehovah even"
6418,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Have me to do, me gifted with this strength,"
6419,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"This wisdom, skill in arms? Sit in a hut"
6420,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of mud beside the Tigris, be a marsh"
6421,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of spirit, sleeping, oozing, grown with flags?"
6422,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Or be Euphrates rushing, giving life"
6423,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And drink of life to fields? What should I do?
6424,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Suffer this Syra to dream and drool?
6425,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Jerusalem to boast, dispute and trade,"
6426,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And vaunt its favoring heaven, or go forth"
6427,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And smite Jerusalem and Tyre and take them,"
6428,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And lead their peoples back to Babylon,"
6429,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And make them work and serve me, build canals,"
6430,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Great reservoirs, my palace, city walls,"
6431,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The Hanging Gardens, till my Babylon"
6432,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"In all this would become a wonder, terror"
6433,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And worthy of my spirit, hope and dream;"
6434,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,A city and a kingdom in the world
6435,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Become the external substance, form and beauty,"
6436,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Administration, order of a soul"
6437,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Lordly and gifted--mine, my Babylon,"
6438,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My dream expressed!
6439,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6440,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,That which I did they tried
6441,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"To do and failed in doing, even themselves"
6442,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Would rule as I have ruled, build as I builded,"
6443,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Win glory as I won it; to that end
6444,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Did they invoke their gods, and in the mouths"
6445,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Of gods and of Jehovah put the curses
6446,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And wails of failure. I have triumphed, now"
6447,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My gods are full of song; I have maintained
6448,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"My kingdom and my spirit, driving out"
6449,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The aggressor Necho, who came forth from Egypt,"
6450,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Syria and Palestine to take from me,"
6451,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Him I destroyed at Carchemish--my spirit
6452,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Have I regained and healed. And now in age,"
6453,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"These eighty years of life gone over me,"
6454,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And rulership of forty years, I sit"
6455,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Within the level sun-light of my age,"
6456,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And at this close of day upon my roof
6457,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And view my Babylon; but without fear
6458,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Madness will come upon me ever again.
6459,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The glory of my kingdom has returned,"
6460,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My honor and my brightness have returned;
6461,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My counselors and lords have come to me;
6462,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"I am established in my age, and excellent"
6463,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Majesty is added unto me.
6464,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6465,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,All this
6466,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Though here upon this roof, upon this spot,"
6467,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"My madness came upon me, when I looked"
6468,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Over the roofs and temples of my city
6469,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And said: Is not this Babylon, the great,"
6470,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,That I have builded for my kingdom’s house
6471,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,By the might of my power and for the honor
6472,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Of my great majesty? Why was it so?
6473,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6474,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"First genius and the dream, then toil and pain"
6475,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"While hands lay stone on stone, and as the stones"
6476,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Rise from the earth, where naked slaves cry out,"
6477,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Wheel, lift and grunt; and mortar, scaffolding,"
6478,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Pillars of cedar strewn confusedly,"
6479,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Your dream is blurred, even while your city rises"
6480,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Out of the dream. I was like to a woman
6481,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"In the pain of travail, who is mad with pain,"
6482,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Scarce knows her friends or what is being done,"
6483,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Nor needs to know, since nature orders all,"
6484,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Delivers her, but lets the mid-wife lift"
6485,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The infant to her breast. Even so with me,"
6486,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"I had conceived this Babylon, nourished it"
6487,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"In the womb of my genius where it grew, came forth"
6488,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Whole like a child at last from scaffoldings,"
6489,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Confusion, waste of mortar, stone and bronze."
6490,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And when it was accomplished, then my madness"
6491,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Came on me in a moment of clear seeing
6492,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"That this which was within me, was without me;"
6493,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Was substance and reality before me;
6494,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Was even myself gone out of me, as the child"
6495,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Goes from the mother--then my madness came
6496,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Not when I saw it first, for I had seen it"
6497,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Both from this roof and from the Hanging Gardens,"
6498,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And from the temple of Bel, and in the streets;"
6499,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"But seen it without knowing, as the mother"
6500,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Exhausted, dulled with agony may know"
6501,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The child is born, without the consciousness,"
6502,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The wonder and the rapture of the child,"
6503,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"As the miracle that was of her, but now"
6504,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Is a miracle external and a life,"
6505,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"A beauty separate, that walks from her"
6506,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And has its life and way, herself and hers,"
6507,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,But different and its own.
6508,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6509,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And so it was
6510,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"When I beheld my Babylon, saw my dream"
6511,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Spread out before me, clear and definite,"
6512,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"A beauty separate, my very soul"
6513,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Torn out of me and fashioned into stone,"
6514,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Having its life and way, myself and mine,"
6515,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Yet being itself, its own. If I had seen"
6516,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Myself divided and become two men,"
6517,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"My other self come toward me, stand, extend"
6518,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"His hand to me, my terror were not more"
6519,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Than this to see my Babylon. In that moment
6520,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My madness came upon me.
6521,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6522,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"But before,"
6523,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Some nights and days before this I had lain
6524,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"In troubled dreams upon my couch, had dreamed"
6525,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of images and trees, for daily cares"
6526,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Of empire and the fears of change and loss
6527,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Had entered in my dreams. Cyaxeres
6528,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Dreamed that a vine grew from his daughter’s womb
6529,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And overshadowed Asia, which denoted"
6530,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Her offspring should be clothed with majesty
6531,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And rulership of Asia. As for me,"
6532,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"My tree was felled, only the stump was left,"
6533,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Bound to the earth with brass and iron--this
6534,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Foretold what I am now, as Daniel said,"
6535,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Interpreting my dream. These dreams had come
6536,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Which shook me for the thought of human life--
6537,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,How frail and fleeting! But again to hear
6538,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Curses about me for my work and genius
6539,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Called by these Jews Ha-Rashang; and to feel
6540,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Though I had chosen Daniel, Hananiah,"
6541,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Michael, Azariah for mine own,"
6542,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And to be taught to help me in the task
6543,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Of my administration; even though
6544,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"I chose all men for duty, wisest use"
6545,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And in my great humanity and strength
6546,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Had placed my subjects where they best could serve
6547,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,The beauty and the progress of my city--
6548,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Though, as I said, to feel that I had done"
6549,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"All things for good and with no thought but good,"
6550,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Yet still to hear these curses and to see
6551,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The worthlessness of human kind, the crowd,"
6552,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,I bowed my head and prayed to Ishtar saying:
6553,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Make me an animal and let me feed
6554,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,With beasts instead of these: So had I prayed
6555,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Before my madness in that moment came.
6556,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6557,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Then as to that, my madness: it was sunset,"
6558,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"I walked upon my palace’s level roof,"
6559,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And looked upon my Babylon; then I thought
6560,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of all my labors, how I had restored"
6561,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The temples of Borsippa, Uruk, Ur,"
6562,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Sippar and Larsa, Dilbat; made the plains"
6563,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Below the great Euphrates rich in corn;
6564,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Brought plenty to my people, bread and wine"
6565,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"To all my people; laughter, as it may be,"
6566,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Between our fated tears to all my people,"
6567,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,And then I looked on Babylon lying there
6568,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Beneath the evening’s sunlight, safe behind"
6569,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Its sixty miles of walls unscalable,"
6570,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Rising four hundred feet, impregnable"
6571,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,For near a hundred feet of width in stone.
6572,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,I saw its hundred gates of durable bronze;
6573,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My eyes were lifted to the terraces
6574,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Up, up above the river to the temple"
6575,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of Bel who blessed my city, and I saw"
6576,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The temples built to Nebo, Sin and Nana,"
6577,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Marduk and Shamash, saw my aqueducts,"
6578,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"The houses of my people, in between"
6579,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,The palm grooves and the gardens bearing food
6580,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Enough to feed the city if besieged;
6581,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Beheld the Hanging Gardens which I built
6582,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"To soothe Amytis, who had memories"
6583,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of mountainous Media, gazing on"
6584,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,The Babylonian plains.
6585,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6586,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,So as I stood
6587,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And looked upon my city, voices passed"
6588,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Below me muttering Ha-Rashang, and then"
6589,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"This Babylon, my Babylon, lay before me"
6590,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"As my genius realized, grown out of me,"
6591,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Myself become another, and a being"
6592,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Which once was me, but now no more was me,"
6593,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Was mine and was not mine; and with that thought
6594,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Rising like Enlil, god of storm and thunder,"
6595,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Over my terrored spirit, I grew mad"
6596,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And fled among the beasts, where for a season"
6597,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"I ate grass with the oxen, let the dew"
6598,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Fall on my body, till my hairs were grown"
6599,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Like eagle’s feathers and my nails were grown
6600,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Like claws of birds. In madness and in hate
6601,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of men and life, in loathing of my glory,"
6602,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,My genius and my labors did I live;
6603,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,In loathing of these tribes who hate the mother
6604,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Goddess of our ritual and belief;
6605,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Tribes who have made religion of the hate
6606,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of procreative nature, curse the flame"
6607,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Of beauty, and of love wherewith I built"
6608,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"This Babylon of glory, lust of life;"
6609,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Till nature cured me and I came again
6610,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"To rule my Babylon, my excellence"
6611,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Of majesty returned.
6612,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,
6613,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"What am I now,"
6614,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Bowed with these eighty years? My Babylon,"
6615,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,What is it now to me? I am a father
6616,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Whose son is aging, even has made his place"
6617,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And lived to see it fade, diminish. A son"
6618,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"So old his sonship is a memory,"
6619,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,Has almost ceased to be--that’s Babylon.
6620,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And I, the father, know this Babylon"
6621,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"As creature of my loins, yet indeed"
6622,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,This city scarcely differs from the cities
6623,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"That lie afar, as aging sons are men"
6624,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"Among the men of earth, but scarcely more"
6625,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,To a father bent with time than other men.
6626,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"For in my riotous genius, like a vine"
6627,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"I did put forth this branch, the vine decays,"
6628,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,The branch will live a season. Out of genius
6629,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"And lust of life to madness, out of madness"
6630,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,"To this tranquillity, and this setting sun,"
6631,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,This peace with heaven.
6632,NEBUCHADNEZZAR: _OR_ EATING GRASS,

6777,ULYSSES,
6778,ULYSSES,
6779,ULYSSES,Settled to evenings before the doorway
6780,ULYSSES,"With Telemachus, who sat at his knee,"
6781,ULYSSES,"“Why did you stay so long from Ithaca,"
6782,ULYSSES,Leaving my mother Penelope?”
6783,ULYSSES,
6784,ULYSSES,"The eyes of the hero rolled and wandered,"
6785,ULYSSES,Thinking of Scylla and Sicily.
6786,ULYSSES,"“That’s a hard question,” answered Ulysses,"
6787,ULYSSES,"“Harder, if answered, for you to see."
6788,ULYSSES,
6789,ULYSSES,"“There was the Cyclops, there was Æolus,"
6790,ULYSSES,"There were the Sirens, and Hades for me;"
6791,ULYSSES,"Apollo’s oxen, Hades’ horrors,"
6792,ULYSSES,"Circe, and then Ogygia."
6793,ULYSSES,
6794,ULYSSES,"“All these after the war, Telemachus--"
6795,ULYSSES,"Too long a tale, as you will agree."
6796,ULYSSES,"The bards must write it, when you are older"
6797,ULYSSES,Read till the gray hairs give you the key
6798,ULYSSES,
6799,ULYSSES,“Of the wonder and richness that were your father’s
6800,ULYSSES,"Life in the war, the long way home."
6801,ULYSSES,"No man has lived, as I, Telemachus,"
6802,ULYSSES,None ever will live in the days to come
6803,ULYSSES,“A life that followed the paths and hollows
6804,ULYSSES,"Of Time, the wayward ways of the streams"
6805,ULYSSES,"That flow round earth, the winds and waters"
6806,ULYSSES,"Of passion, wisdom, thought and dreams."
6807,ULYSSES,
6808,ULYSSES,"“There are two things, my boy, and only"
6809,ULYSSES,"Two in the world, remember this:"
6810,ULYSSES,"One thing is men, the other women,"
6811,ULYSSES,And after the two of them nothing is.
6812,ULYSSES,
6813,ULYSSES,"“I have known men as king and warrior,"
6814,ULYSSES,"Known them as liegmen, spears of the line."
6815,ULYSSES,Good enough lamps for workaday darkness--
6816,ULYSSES,"They are not food, they are not wine;"
6817,ULYSSES,
6818,ULYSSES,“They are not heat that stir the secret
6819,ULYSSES,"Core of the seed of a man, be sure."
6820,ULYSSES,"And I, Ulysses, needed the planets,"
6821,ULYSSES,"And suns of the spring to live, mature.”"
6822,ULYSSES,
6823,ULYSSES,"“What do you mean?” asked Telemachus,"
6824,ULYSSES,"“And, say is it true you lost eight years"
6825,ULYSSES,"Away from Ithaca, me and my mother"
6826,ULYSSES,Because of a certain Calypso’s tears?”
6827,ULYSSES,
6828,ULYSSES,The eyes of the hero rolled and wandered.
6829,ULYSSES,"“There now, my boy, you have the truth."
6830,ULYSSES,I’ll try to tell you perhaps you’ll get it
6831,ULYSSES,In spite of your filial love and your youth.
6832,ULYSSES,
6833,ULYSSES,"“First, understand there are two things only;--"
6834,ULYSSES,"One is women, the other men."
6835,ULYSSES,"And men I knew before and at Troyland,"
6836,ULYSSES,And searched their hearts again and again.
6837,ULYSSES,
6838,ULYSSES,"“What do you get? Secrets of cunning,"
6839,ULYSSES,"Cruelty, strength, and much that you use"
6840,ULYSSES,In the battle with them; but what’s a woman?
6841,ULYSSES,"She is the mother, she is the Muse"
6842,ULYSSES,
6843,ULYSSES,“That leads and lifts to life--Telemachus
6844,ULYSSES,How can I tell you?--have a care!
6845,ULYSSES,"Young men seize on the words of wisdom,"
6846,ULYSSES,"And find their hands in a silken snare,"
6847,ULYSSES,
6848,ULYSSES,"“Hearing blindly, seeing literally,"
6849,ULYSSES,"What is a sword, a lamp, a shield?"
6850,ULYSSES,"Touch and learn, the name is only"
6851,ULYSSES,The shell wherein the thing is concealed.”
6852,ULYSSES,
6853,ULYSSES,“What do you mean?” asked Telemachus.
6854,ULYSSES,“What do I mean? Attend to me!
6855,ULYSSES,"I’ll try to tell you, telling a story"
6856,ULYSSES,Of the island called Ogygia.
6857,ULYSSES,
6858,ULYSSES,“I know women--how shall I tell you?
6859,ULYSSES,"Women are good, and good is wine."
6860,ULYSSES,Yet how to tell the wine and women
6861,ULYSSES,That turn her adorers into swine.
6862,ULYSSES,
6863,ULYSSES,"“You must have aid of Hermes, swiftness"
6864,ULYSSES,Of spirit and sense to tell them apart;
6865,ULYSSES,"How to be strong, how to be tender,"
6866,ULYSSES,How to surrender and keep your heart.
6867,ULYSSES,
6868,ULYSSES,"“Easy for me to baffle Circe,"
6869,ULYSSES,Easy the Sirens to slip--just wax!
6870,ULYSSES,"I steered for Ithaca, you and your mother,"
6871,ULYSSES,"Isle to isle on the ocean’s tracks,"
6872,ULYSSES,
6873,ULYSSES,“Until I came and saw Calypso.
6874,ULYSSES,Son you would be with Calypso yet.
6875,ULYSSES,It takes a hero suppled in flame
6876,ULYSSES,"To see Calypso, and leave, forget"
6877,ULYSSES,
6878,ULYSSES,"Face and voice enough to leave her,"
6879,ULYSSES,"Spurn her promises, turn from her tears,"
6880,ULYSSES,"Come to Ithaca with this doorway,"
6881,ULYSSES,"Age that hovers, the little years.”"
6882,ULYSSES,
6883,ULYSSES,“What do you mean?” asked Telemachus.
6884,ULYSSES,"“Live and learn,” Ulysses replied."
6885,ULYSSES,“Calypso promised me youth eternal
6886,ULYSSES,If I would stay and make her my bride.”
6887,ULYSSES,
6888,ULYSSES,“And why not stay?” asked Telemachus
6889,ULYSSES,"“To have her for wife, if not a youth"
6890,ULYSSES,Eternal given you?” “Boy of me listen
6891,ULYSSES,Now for the core of the deepest truth:
6892,ULYSSES,
6893,ULYSSES,“We dined in grottoes of blooming ivy;
6894,ULYSSES,We supped in halls of cedar and gold;
6895,ULYSSES,"We slept on balconies, sapphire tented--"
6896,ULYSSES,But even I found this growing old.
6897,ULYSSES,
6898,ULYSSES,"“I saw her beauty bare by star light,"
6899,ULYSSES,"And by the sea in the sun, and stoled"
6900,ULYSSES,In silk as white as snow on Parnassus--
6901,ULYSSES,But even I found this growing old.
6902,ULYSSES,
6903,ULYSSES,"“Her tresses smelt of the blooms of Hymettus,"
6904,ULYSSES,Her breasts were cymbals sweet to behold;
6905,ULYSSES,Her voice was a harp of pearl and silver--
6906,ULYSSES,But even I found this growing old.
6907,ULYSSES,
6908,ULYSSES,“Her Lips were like the flame of a taper
6909,ULYSSES,"Scented and musical, as she would fold"
6910,ULYSSES,White arms over the brawn of my shoulders--
6911,ULYSSES,But even I found this growing old.
6912,ULYSSES,
6913,ULYSSES,"“She promised me this and youth forever,"
6914,ULYSSES,So long as the sun and the planets rolled.
6915,ULYSSES,"I knew they were gifts she could not give me,"
6916,ULYSSES,Empty promises too grow old.
6917,ULYSSES,
6918,ULYSSES,"“And even if given, why forever"
6919,ULYSSES,Live the things that have grown enough?
6920,ULYSSES,"She loved me, wonderful Calypso."
6921,ULYSSES,But what is love? It is only love.
6922,ULYSSES,
6923,ULYSSES,"“And the salt of a man turns to his doorway,"
6924,ULYSSES,He makes his will for his blood at the end.
6925,ULYSSES,"My boy, that’s why I left Calypso"
6926,ULYSSES,And came to you--do you comprehend?
6927,ULYSSES,
6928,ULYSSES,"“To sit unshorn, and clothed as I choose,"
6929,ULYSSES,"Talk with the swineherd, potter or shirk,"
6930,ULYSSES,"Babble at ease, my boy, with your mother"
6931,ULYSSES,Around the house at rest or at work.
6932,ULYSSES,
6933,ULYSSES,"“And you must not forget, Telemachus,"
6934,ULYSSES,In order to have immortality
6935,ULYSSES,It had to be with Calypso--therefore
6936,ULYSSES,"I came to you and Penelope,"
6937,ULYSSES,
6938,ULYSSES,"“Who soon will leave me, at best, or else"
6939,ULYSSES,I’ll leave you for the Isles of the Blest.
6940,ULYSSES,"I find this doorway good, Telemachus,"
6941,ULYSSES,As a place to dream and a place to rest.”
6942,ULYSSES,
6943,ULYSSES,"“I do not understand, Ulysses,"
6944,ULYSSES,Father of me. At first the call
6945,ULYSSES,"Of the blood, I thought, would hasten you homeward."
6946,ULYSSES,And now I wonder you came at all
6947,ULYSSES,
6948,ULYSSES,"“Here to Ithaca. What, my father,"
6949,ULYSSES,Is here but my mother growing old;
6950,ULYSSES,"Aged Lærtes, Telemachus--"
6951,ULYSSES,What of Calypso’s hair of gold?
6952,ULYSSES,
6953,ULYSSES,"“What of the island, what of the feasting,"
6954,ULYSSES,"What of her kisses, were it I"
6955,ULYSSES,"I’d spurn eternal youth, as a mortal"
6956,ULYSSES,Live with Calypso until I should die.”
6957,ULYSSES,
6958,ULYSSES,"“I have no doubt,” said the many minded"
6959,ULYSSES,Great Ulysses. “It’s plain to see
6960,ULYSSES,You are a boy yet. When is supper?
6961,ULYSSES,Go ask your mother Penelope.”

6966,THE PARTY,THE PARTY
6967,THE PARTY,
6968,THE PARTY,
6969,THE PARTY,Our wishes not consulted whether
6970,THE PARTY,"We chose to come, not even the hour,"
6971,THE PARTY,Some would have asked for fairer weather
6972,THE PARTY,Than on a day of sun and shower.
6973,THE PARTY,"No chance to choose! And some got wet,"
6974,THE PARTY,Were sick and nervous while they stayed;
6975,THE PARTY,"Others came in the sun, the debt"
6976,THE PARTY,Of Fortune to them overpaid.
6977,THE PARTY,"We all came ignorant, willy-nilly,"
6978,THE PARTY,"Pell mell, piebald, grave and silly,"
6979,THE PARTY,"Resistless to the party drawn,"
6980,THE PARTY,Which had gone on and would go on
6981,THE PARTY,From dawn to night and night to dawn.
6982,THE PARTY,"Though some, it seemed, had scarcely come"
6983,THE PARTY,"Before they left; and some at noon,"
6984,THE PARTY,Or morning bade adieu. The moon
6985,THE PARTY,Saw others take departure home.
6986,THE PARTY,All talked about it as you would;
6987,THE PARTY,"Esteemed it dull, over too soon,--"
6988,THE PARTY,"Bad, sad, or wearing, very good!"
6989,THE PARTY,
6990,THE PARTY,Over too soon! Yet truth to tell
6991,THE PARTY,It was a lasting festival.
6992,THE PARTY,Guests had to leave--and that was all.
6993,THE PARTY,To each some different thing befell.
6994,THE PARTY,The party went on just the same.
6995,THE PARTY,"First guests departed, late arrived;"
6996,THE PARTY,Fresh candles burned with brighter flame;
6997,THE PARTY,"New cakes were cut, and laughter thrived"
6998,THE PARTY,Over a wit re-sharpened. Crumbs
6999,THE PARTY,Of eaten things were brushed away;
7000,THE PARTY,Dishes were cleared and lovelier bowls
7001,THE PARTY,Were piled with new picked grapes and plums.
7002,THE PARTY,The place the while was mad and gay
7003,THE PARTY,Because of sad and merry souls.
7004,THE PARTY,There was a room for love’s romancing;
7005,THE PARTY,"A room for talk, a room for dancing;"
7006,THE PARTY,A room for globes and maps and books;
7007,THE PARTY,"A room with sky lights, a room of nooks;"
7008,THE PARTY,"A room of pictures, marbles, bronzes;"
7009,THE PARTY,"Guns, gauntlets, spears, armor, sconces;"
7010,THE PARTY,A room of racks and torture hooks;
7011,THE PARTY,"A room of ikons, shrines and josses;"
7012,THE PARTY,"A room of crosiers, cups and crosses;"
7013,THE PARTY,A room--but everything was here--
7014,THE PARTY,"That brain can think of, plan or make"
7015,THE PARTY,"To shackle spirits, honor brows,"
7016,THE PARTY,"To thrill the heart, or start the tear,"
7017,THE PARTY,"Or stir a rapture, or an ache--"
7018,THE PARTY,It was a wonder house!
7019,THE PARTY,
7020,THE PARTY,I noticed this: You enter with
7021,THE PARTY,"Fellow arrivers, ill at ease."
7022,THE PARTY,"The rooms are full, and some of these"
7023,THE PARTY,"Know you, but only with their eyes"
7024,THE PARTY,Acknowledge you in mild surprise.
7025,THE PARTY,Listen! and you will get the pith
7026,THE PARTY,And meaning of what went before
7027,THE PARTY,"From these. The high ones talk in myth,"
7028,THE PARTY,Who own the rooms--in loose ellipsis
7029,THE PARTY,Show what their tried out fellowships’
7030,THE PARTY,Inner communion is and lore.
7031,THE PARTY,But kinder souls say: “Some one great
7032,THE PARTY,Was here before you came.” “This thing
7033,THE PARTY,Happened this morning.” “Look! that one
7034,THE PARTY,"Just going out, is so and so.”"
7035,THE PARTY,“There comes the waiter with your plate!”
7036,THE PARTY,“You should have heard that woman sing!
7037,THE PARTY,"She’s going!” “Oh, we’ve had such fun.”"
7038,THE PARTY,“What happened? What’s ahead? Its slow!”
7039,THE PARTY,Late stayers stare your ignorance:
7040,THE PARTY,"“Why don’t they tell us?” “Oh, no use,"
7041,THE PARTY,You wouldn’t understand. You’ll know
7042,THE PARTY,"Later, perhaps, by happy chance."
7043,THE PARTY,"And if you don’t, it’s too abstruse,"
7044,THE PARTY,We have no words. Feed on and run
7045,THE PARTY,The rooms around. You’ll see what we
7046,THE PARTY,"Have felt, seen, suffered and enjoyed.”"
7047,THE PARTY,
7048,THE PARTY,"And so it is to father and son,"
7049,THE PARTY,Mother and maid. Then what should be?
7050,THE PARTY,"The bell rings, some are glad, annoyed:"
7051,THE PARTY,"New guests are coming, and for some"
7052,THE PARTY,"The Chauffeur rings, the Car has come!"
7053,THE PARTY,"And we who were the novices,"
7054,THE PARTY,"And wondered, stared, deferred, inquired,"
7055,THE PARTY,"Are now in charge, and take amiss"
7056,THE PARTY,"Curious questions, have acquired"
7057,THE PARTY,"The Party’s manner, secrets, speech."
7058,THE PARTY,"And see, as those before us saw,"
7059,THE PARTY,"New and old groups are troubled, each"
7060,THE PARTY,Is deaf and dumb. How can we draw
7061,THE PARTY,Their wordless wonder to the point?
7062,THE PARTY,What would you know? How can we reach
7063,THE PARTY,And vocalize your dumbness? What
7064,THE PARTY,"To ask of us you do not know,"
7065,THE PARTY,And what to tell you we know not--
7066,THE PARTY,"Groups, therefore, clearly out of joint."
7067,THE PARTY,
7068,THE PARTY,"Yes, but they do not know us now."
7069,THE PARTY,Most here are strange. Where is the throng
7070,THE PARTY,With whom we came? Where is the brow
7071,THE PARTY,"Sunny of hair, the voice of song?"
7072,THE PARTY,"Where is the hand that understood,"
7073,THE PARTY,"Without a word? There’s none to hear,"
7074,THE PARTY,And know our meaning as he would ...
7075,THE PARTY,New wine is opened. No more wine!
7076,THE PARTY,New cake is cut. I must instead
7077,THE PARTY,"Drink brandy, bitters, heavy beer."
7078,THE PARTY,"I rather like this coarse, black bread."
7079,THE PARTY,"Strange music plays, not high and clear."
7080,THE PARTY,No matter! For you might inspect
7081,THE PARTY,"The pictures, marbles, once again,"
7082,THE PARTY,"Look at the books some more, correct"
7083,THE PARTY,First errors. Surely that were well.
7084,THE PARTY,"And you can do it, having fared"
7085,THE PARTY,So differently. Was that the bell?
7086,THE PARTY,“Your chauffeur’s here!” “Why speed me so?”
7087,THE PARTY,“Too bad! Too bad you have to go!”
7088,THE PARTY,
7089,THE PARTY,"Yes, but the party’s over! No?"
7090,THE PARTY,Over for me. And I am tired.
7091,THE PARTY,Desire for what I once desired
7092,THE PARTY,Is dying or is satisfied.
7093,THE PARTY,Tell him to wait a moment--yes
7094,THE PARTY,I wish to see what may betide;
7095,THE PARTY,Watch the new corners laugh and feast;
7096,THE PARTY,"Watch eyes that glance, and breasts that heave;"
7097,THE PARTY,"Watch cunning, aspiration, pride;"
7098,THE PARTY,"Watch soldier, statesman, poet, priest;"
7099,THE PARTY,"Watch those who doubt and who believe,"
7100,THE PARTY,"Untangle, tangle, spin and weave."
7101,THE PARTY,"I’ve helped to make the party, still"
7102,THE PARTY,The party is not to my will.
7103,THE PARTY,"I can re-make it, now I know"
7104,THE PARTY,"How to enjoy it better, use"
7105,THE PARTY,Its hour more wisely. “By your leave.
7106,THE PARTY,"Just wait a moment!” “Well, your car"
7107,THE PARTY,Is at the door and must not park;
7108,THE PARTY,"The way you go is rather far,"
7109,THE PARTY,Besides it’s growing dark.”
7110,THE PARTY,Bowed out! No matter! I am due
7111,THE PARTY,"At a better party, so they say."
7112,THE PARTY,To-morrow is a better day--
7113,THE PARTY,Always to-morrow. “What of you?
7114,THE PARTY,"You’re coning? Well, I hope you may.”"
7115,THE PARTY,"“Meantime good night, a safe return,"
7116,THE PARTY,And blessings on your way.”

7121,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA
7122,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7123,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7124,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"This is the place, my friend Aristo. Here"
7125,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,We sit and muse on the state of the world. Alas!
7126,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,What are we coming to?
7127,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7128,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,The tufa walls
7129,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Inlaid with yellow lichens look like bronze
7130,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Gold filagreed. And through those rifts and breaks
7131,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"There are the trunks of ilex, gnarled and dark."
7132,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Look! Nature mocks us. Hadrian is asleep
7133,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,These nearly hundred years. Does cyclamen
7134,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Crimson about these walls grow less profuse?
7135,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Or these anemones laugh less to the sun?
7136,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Or bramble, honeysuckle, bougainvillea"
7137,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Desert the gardens of the emperor?
7138,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The merle and golden-crested wrens build nests,"
7139,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Sing the hymeneal song! But man, poor man,"
7140,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Forsakes his triumphs, work, his palaces."
7141,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And barbarous weeds sprout over them and creep,"
7142,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And choke his wisdom and his art.
7143,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7144,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Let’s sit
7145,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Here in this colonnade. Philosophers
7146,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"From Rome and Athens, Alexandria,"
7147,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"From mystic India, walked this colonnade,"
7148,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And let the mind run free. It is no more,"
7149,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Unless we fight the human weeds that spring
7150,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Under the rains that darken Rome. Let’s up
7151,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,With hoes and root them.
7152,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7153,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Here’s cat-brier--chop!
7154,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Cat-brier, Christian meekness, fair to view--"
7155,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,But how it stinks! And briars: pain and loss
7156,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,For ecstasy and gain beyond--I chop!
7157,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Chop here, Aristo, get your friends to chop,"
7158,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Lest all the world be given up to weeds,"
7159,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,As Hadrian’s Villa is about to be.
7160,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Rome soon will stretch her templed neck to breathe
7161,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Above the thorns, the hyssop. Even now"
7162,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,The state is crumbling with the heresy
7163,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"That Rome should not be reverenced and saved,"
7164,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,But every soul saved. The Imperial City
7165,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,To which each Roman is a servitor
7166,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Put by for doctrine making every heart
7167,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Worthy of saving from the wreck of life--
7168,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"I chop this weed. And for the soul of Rome,"
7169,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The lazar soul, the slave, the fuller, cobbler,"
7170,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The fool, the God-forsaken and the child ..."
7171,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,What if Rome fall? The City of God remains
7172,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Eternal in the Heavens. Yes, but Earth,"
7173,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Where is thy city, if it be not Rome?"
7174,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Destroy your Romans, Hadrians, what is left?--"
7175,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Itinerant exorcists and prophets, idlers,"
7176,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And sacred beggars, leper lips that curse"
7177,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Rome and her beauty? These the citizens
7178,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of the City of God! What will that city be?
7179,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Themselves externalized, as Rome has flowered"
7180,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,From Roman minds; but never a Hadrian Villa
7181,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"In the City of God, never from scowls and sores!"
7182,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"No You shall have a world of trade and lies,"
7183,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of itching and denials, for a world"
7184,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of freedom and expression, wine and song."
7185,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,These huckstering Jews are planting in our Rome
7186,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,The faith that they persuaded God to kill
7187,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,His Son to save them. And a huckstering
7188,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Will taint the flesh of all who eat this god.
7189,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,But yet how they will rub their palms and coo
7190,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And ape a meekness. Here! Aristo, chop!..."
7191,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7192,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,But just so long as stories remain in place
7193,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of Hadrian’s Villa, eyes will look upon them"
7194,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And sense the mind of Rome, and what it was:"
7195,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"That eyes were made for seeing, ears for hearing,"
7196,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Hands made to touch, tongues made to taste, minds made"
7197,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"To think, imagine, love given to indulge"
7198,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,For rapture. There’s no law of heaven or earth
7199,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"That trims eyes, ears, the senses,"
7200,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of use; but all were made to leaf and bloom
7201,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The idea of the eye, the ear, the hand."
7202,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And only reason with regard for health
7203,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of eyes, ears, hands, may guide and say: how far...."
7204,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,See now what Hadrian’s mind created here:--
7205,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A tragic theatre, a comic theatre."
7206,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"What for? For eyes’ sake, for exploring life."
7207,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Katharsis? Yes. But use? No use to him
7208,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Who thinks life sin, the world’s end near, for Jews"
7209,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Who like the frogs in marshes croaking, say:"
7210,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"“For our sakes was the world created, we"
7211,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Alone are chosen of God.” No use for him
7212,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Who sees enough of suffering in life
7213,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Without its mimicry; sees not the art
7214,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of shooting light between the mystery
7215,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of human fate, and waking sympathy"
7216,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Through understanding. Christian weeds I chop,"
7217,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Whose roots begin to sap the tragic roots
7218,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of Sophocles.
7219,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7220,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,But I say eyes may see:
7221,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And if I wish to watch the lions fight
7222,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"What interdicts me, and what reason for it?"
7223,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Now look how Hadrian’s mind puts into flower:
7224,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A temple for Greek books, and one for Latin;"
7225,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And there’s the stadium, and there’s the baths."
7226,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,These Christians frown the bath. If I make out
7227,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Jesus may come today, and wherefore wash?"
7228,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Besides the naked bathers cling and kiss
7229,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Within the tepidarium at times, and hence"
7230,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Out with all bathing!
7231,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7232,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,There’s the palace too
7233,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Which o’ertops Nero’s Golden House, they say."
7234,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And what guest chambers here! The laughing soul
7235,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of Hadrian glows amid his friends. What’s best
7236,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"In life, Aristo? Why, when the soul is freed,"
7237,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"From business, traffic, grasping, thought of self,"
7238,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The aches of the day, and being freed shines forth"
7239,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"As star companions star, in smiles and words"
7240,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of praise, affection. Hadrian loves the faith"
7241,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of happiness, and lets his guests fare free,"
7242,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Wander eight miles of garden, enter vales"
7243,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of Tempe, watch a mimic Peneus"
7244,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Flow by; encounter fauns amid the brakes;
7245,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Surprise Bacchantes sleeping; hear from hills
7246,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,A chorus of Euripides soothe their souls
7247,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"With dreams before Faustina’s sculptured face,"
7248,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Or Antinous, Apollo, Venus; bathe"
7249,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Their glowing bodies in the pools; partake
7250,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of food or wine, gifts of the gods. Such life"
7251,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Is passing, soon will pass. Aurelius"
7252,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Lies under thought, which thrived before the day"
7253,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of Paul for all of that, the folly sees not"
7254,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of slaving Christians, while himself is teaching"
7255,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The Christian doctrine! Ugliness, denial,"
7256,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Self-laceration, beggary, are older"
7257,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Than Jesus--and I chop!
7258,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7259,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,But let the world
7260,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Submit to weeds, in time what will you have?"
7261,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Not Hadrian’s Villa, but a villa walled,"
7262,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Walls spiked and guarded, and a house of walls"
7263,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Empty of sculpture, where a miser-man,"
7264,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Guarding his gold, a lone man eating bread"
7265,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And milk, rules realms and countries from the book"
7266,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of Enoch, Exodus, the Septuagint,"
7267,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And these purported writings of one Paul;
7268,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And who has made his heart a granary
7269,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,For seed of faith and trade. This weed I chop!
7270,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,For then your world lies flatter than the land
7271,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of that campagna, made a marsh for frogs,"
7272,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Dull grass and feculent roots, as it would lie"
7273,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,If once invaders smashed the aqueducts
7274,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And drowned our lovely plain!
7275,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7276,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"You see, my friend"
7277,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Why I fight back the weeds. This is not all,"
7278,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,For I know what engenders Christian faith:
7279,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Man dreams he can be saved, but saved from what?"
7280,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Sin? What is sin? Age? What can save from age,"
7281,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"What keep the spring of youth, its rosy flesh,"
7282,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Its spirit never tiring, hope undarkened,"
7283,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Its courage without fears, long dreams and days?"
7284,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Why nothing! All’s illusion that holds forth
7285,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A medicine for wrinkles, shrunken arms."
7286,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Therefore what saves from death? Does Jesus save?
7287,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Does Jesus ease a soul’s pain, cure a loss"
7288,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Save as these devotees may soothe their hearts
7289,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"With prospects of to-morrow, or of heaven?"
7290,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"No! good Aristo, all this Roman realm,"
7291,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Washed by this sea, for centuries has been"
7292,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,As fertile as the valley of the Nile
7293,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"For seed of this salvation dream, the seed"
7294,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of Mithra and Osiris, Krishna, Budda,"
7295,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Adonis, Tammuz, Dionysus, Attis,"
7296,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,What is this seed of Jesus? Nothing new:
7297,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,The virgin birth? That’s old as human dreams.
7298,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"There’s Dionysus born of Semele,"
7299,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A virgin, and of Zeus; great Dionysus"
7300,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"The resurrection of the year, the mad"
7301,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Intoxicating power of nature, wine."
7302,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,There is a myth that Jesus at a feast
7303,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Turned water into wine, a Bacchic feat."
7304,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,One myth blends in another like mosaics
7305,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of microscopic jewels. I go on.
7306,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Zeus fathers many sons of virgins born,"
7307,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Is not content with one. He takes Danæ
7308,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And Perseus is the fruit, who slays the Gorgons"
7309,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And saves Andromeda, the human soul."
7310,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Devaki is a virgin, weds Vishnu,"
7311,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And Krishna comes. A virgin is the mother
7312,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of Budda. Horus springs from virgin Isis,"
7313,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Our Lady, Queen of Heaven, Star of the Sea,"
7314,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Mother of God, so called for centuries"
7315,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Before the days of Mary. Neith, the virgin,"
7316,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Was mother of Osiris. Mithra’s born
7317,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of a virgin mother.
7318,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7319,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,This is what I mean
7320,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"By fertile soil of Egypt, Persia, Greece,"
7321,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,That crops the seed of Jesus. Is this all?
7322,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,All saviours tally fully. All were born
7323,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"In caves or stables, chambers under ground;"
7324,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,All labored for the welfare of the race;
7325,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"All were light bringers, healers, mediators"
7326,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Between the gods and men. All fell in death,"
7327,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Descended to the underworld. All rose
7328,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,To strive for men in heaven; all created
7329,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Communions, churches, rites of water, wine,"
7330,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Last suppers, brought the entheos, spilt their blood;"
7331,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"God, Krishna, Dionysus, Hercules."
7332,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And as for that Tammuz was crucified,"
7333,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Prometheus was nailed and chained.
7334,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7335,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,You know!
7336,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"These from the mysteries of the heart, from life;--"
7337,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Death of the year, birth of the year, the hope"
7338,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,That shines amid the mist of doubts and days;
7339,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,The dream that says if nature leave the grave
7340,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of winter, what’s the life of man, to be"
7341,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Shut from the law that wakes the fallen seed?
7342,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"If God renews the wine, I drink the juice"
7343,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of the grape and live! If God be in the bull,"
7344,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And must be, life is life, and all is life"
7345,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of one divinity, I drink the blood,"
7346,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"I wash therein, cleanse sin, and celebrate"
7347,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A ritual of salvation, endless life!..."
7348,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"I trace all Krishnas, Mithras in this god,"
7349,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Hope’s latest dream.
7350,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,
7351,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,What’s needed but a flame
7352,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,That draws these older flames? What but a man
7353,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of inspiration, labor, sacrifice,"
7354,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A poet, hater of the scurvy times,"
7355,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Killed for his blasting eyes, accusing tongue,"
7356,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,To have your Christos? Jesus lived. Why not?
7357,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"’Tis credible; killed by the Jews, why not?"
7358,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And made a sacrifice for many--doctrine
7359,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,World old and wide. From Babylon the Jews
7360,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Brought Hammurapi, brought Sacaea too,"
7361,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"A ritual for prisoners doomed to die,"
7362,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"By which they would be decked in kingly robes,"
7363,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Stripped, scourged and hanged even as we have done"
7364,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"At Saturnalia. How else “King of the Jews,”"
7365,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Except by ancient custom? Think, Aristo,"
7366,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Would great Tiberius suffer such sedition
7367,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Except as drama and in mockery?
7368,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Aristo, if this Jesus were the god"
7369,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"As Mithra, Dionysus are, ’twere well"
7370,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,With Rome and Hadrian’s Villa. Understand
7371,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"If these infatuate zealots, Jews would keep"
7372,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Their god, belief, but still conform to Rome,"
7373,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Rome’s gods, the empire reverence, who would care?"
7374,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,No Roman! No one! But to hear these prophets
7375,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Cry through our cities, camps: to everlasting"
7376,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Flames commit our cities and our lands,"
7377,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And curse us out of Jewish scriptures, draw"
7378,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,The imprecations of the epileptic
7379,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Paul upon us, this I fight, I chop!"
7380,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,I stand with sword against the enervation
7381,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Of private judgment, that the common man"
7382,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Is heaven’s prize. This demos mania
7383,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,And ruin of the empire I oppose.
7384,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And when these plagues of Christians grow too loud,"
7385,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And Rome arouses, wants the lions fed,"
7386,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Or crosses painted with a little red,"
7387,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"I go to see. These anarch colleges,"
7388,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Illicit schools, called churches, quiet down"
7389,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,When in the circus Christian bones are crunched....
7390,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,

7392,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,If lowliness and other worldiness;
7393,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"If meekness, sacrifice; if life’s denial;"
7394,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"If all this creed out of inverted thought,"
7395,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Shame for the lust of life, the Orient’s"
7396,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Sick perfume, drugs, if all of this be taken"
7397,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Into the body of Rome, the world; the poison"
7398,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,Of Jesus swallowed--this my consolation:
7399,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Life, being God, is stronger than God’s Son;"
7400,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"Life will digest it, and evacuate"
7401,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"What cannot be digested, and retain"
7402,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,What can be used. Another Rome will rise
7403,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"If our Rome fall. Let’s go up there, a while,"
7404,CELSUS AT HADRIAN’S VILLA,"And watch the waterfalls, and have some wine."

7795,VI,"Have we given up the sister realms, the freedom of the States"
7796,VI,Through a tyranny of shame
7797,VI,In the South land where the black-man wears the gag?
7798,VI,"Shall we bear the blight of cities, charged to electorates"
7799,VI,In the silence of the bearers of the flag?
7800,VI,Shall the cowardice of sycophants commissioned to obey
7801,VI,"Defeat the trust, but call it still our voice?"
7802,VI,"Shall we who give you, as we wish, the choice"
7803,VI,"Of freedom to be solemn or rejoice,"

7810,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS
7811,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7812,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7813,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Marion Strode, my friend, a chanting voice"
7814,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"For heaven’s kingdom on this earth, a hand"
7815,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Ready to open prisons, heal the bruised,"
7816,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Bring liberty to men, was wrought to fire"
7817,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Over the martyrdom of Ott. He called it
7818,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"A martyrdom, and said: “Come go with me"
7819,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And comfort Ott in prison.” So he went.
7820,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7821,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"And on the train I read what Ott had said,"
7822,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,For which he suffered prison. Jail for words
7823,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Is older than Saint Paul; as old as cities,"
7824,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And fear that dreads the change that words may bring.
7825,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,I also saw a picture of this Ott:
7826,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Head like a billiard ball, a little cracked,"
7827,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Warped egg-like too. A homeless cat made furtive
7828,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,By missive cans and frightful hoots. A ragged
7829,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Gabriel shut from heaven’s bliss. A porter
7830,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Of righteousness compelled to open the gate
7831,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of paradise for Mark Hanna, but himself"
7832,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Debarred an entrance. Asking nothing either,"
7833,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Yet facing God to sift him, find him pure"
7834,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,As those who enter.
7835,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7836,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Here’s a man who never
7837,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,To eighty years loses from brightening eyes
7838,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Flames from the stake reflected, or the shadows"
7839,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Of prison for the sake of conscience. Thinks
7840,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,No one who has soft raiment ever reads
7841,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"“The Ancient Lowly,” or the “Martyrdom"
7842,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of Labor,” history, science; none are wise"
7843,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,But radicals.
7844,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7845,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And then I read in full
7846,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,What Ott had said for which they prisoned him.
7847,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,They charged him with obstructing the enlistment.
7848,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,But in his speech there isn’t a single word
7849,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Advising a resistance to the draft,"
7850,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,By just so many words concretely. Quite
7851,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Adroit this speech, quite foxy. Yet it’s true"
7852,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,If you knew you could get a man to act
7853,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"On what was in his mind, long brooded on"
7854,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,By giving him a shot of alcohol;
7855,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And if you gave it and he did the deed
7856,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"You would be an inciter, principal"
7857,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And doer of the deed.
7858,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7859,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Now take this speech
7860,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Which glorifies the socialistic cause;
7861,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Lauds divers martyrs tried, already jailed"
7862,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"For words against the draft; denounces Prussia,"
7863,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Oh, yes! but in such words as hit the home"
7864,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of the brave, the free America! Ouch! Quit!"
7865,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Says that the master class has always made
7866,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The wars in which the subject class was used,"
7867,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Which never had a voice in making war:
7868,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Affirmative universal! What’s the answer?
7869,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"He means this war, this holy war, the traitor!"
7870,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Denounces capital, exhorts the crowd"
7871,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,To strive for something better than to be
7872,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Fodder for cannon. What? The prize of death
7873,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,In battle called a foddering of the cannon!
7874,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,What better thing to strive for? Throw him out!
7875,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,The price of coal is due to plutocrats;
7876,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"They’re bleeding you, and say it’s for the war."
7877,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,They lie! What’s treason? Not disloyal
7878,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To those you work for, but disloyalty"
7879,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To truth, your better self."
7880,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7881,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,If you believe this
7882,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Would you become a soldier, or say no,"
7883,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,I will not fight for such a cause or country?...
7884,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"I see, said Voltaire, three times one are one."
7885,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,A man in heat might flout the trinity;
7886,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,But when he studies out some persiflage
7887,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,With which to flout it--well--here’s Ott who has
7888,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Contempt aforethought for the war and draft,"
7889,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"And squirts his venom through closed teeth, the better"
7890,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To shoot it further, make it hit."
7891,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7892,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,I said:
7893,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,“Your Mr. Ott is guilty of the charge.
7894,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,No use to talk of constitutions. No.
7895,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"He loves the Lovejoys, Garrisons and Paines,"
7896,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The Brunos, martyrs, let him stand his ground.”"
7897,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"And Marion Strode replied: “Yes, Ott is guilty."
7898,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,But did he speak the truth? Yes? Very well.
7899,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,It must have been the time and place that made
7900,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,The penitentiary for twenty years
7901,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,A fitting penalty. But when’s the time
7902,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To talk against war’s horror? When there’s war,"
7903,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"And words are vivid, or when war is not,"
7904,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And talks against it sound like when you say
7905,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,‘Look out for bears’ to children?
7906,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7907,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,“War-lords talk
7908,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,In peace and war to be prepared. May I
7909,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Prepare for peace in war time, when my words"
7910,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Have demonstrations in the events of war?
7911,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,You think not? The majority has spoken!
7912,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Well, has it? Point me out a plebiscite"
7913,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,That asked for war. But take your point at full
7914,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,The majority has spoken: why forbid
7915,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The back-hall, soap-box rostrum; what will come?"
7916,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,The majority will stick and go ahead;
7917,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Or else the soap box will persuade it back
7918,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And end the war. Is there another term?
7919,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The great majority annoyed, obstructed,"
7920,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Delayed, distracted, harried! Well, you know"
7921,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,The Tories did that to George Washington.
7922,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"And Lincoln! Why, the people at the polls"
7923,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Returned a critical congress. And if trials
7924,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Strengthen the character of a man, why not"
7925,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Obstructions for majorities howling war
7926,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,To clarify and strengthen them? God works
7927,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"In ways mysterious, but in every way;"
7928,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Whatever is is true.
7929,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7930,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"“Ott, as I see it,"
7931,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Was jailed for twenty years for speaking truth
7932,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,At the wrong time and place. A heavy fine
7933,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"For wrong a æsthetics, etiquette."
7934,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7935,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"“I go deeper,"
7936,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"I pass the law that jailed him, all æsthetics,"
7937,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"All etiquette, all wrong of time and place."
7938,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Let’s enter in a realm of realer things.
7939,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,What does Ott stand for in a war or peace?
7940,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Is it not freedom, equal rights, the end"
7941,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of poverty, disease? Has he not held"
7942,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The torch of science up, the torch of thought"
7943,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Interpreting the greatest minds to win
7944,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Attention to them and adherence to them?
7945,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"If he did this, has not his life been given"
7946,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To making America a brighter light,"
7947,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"A sounder realm, her breed a stronger breed?"
7948,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"If he be not a light himself, but only"
7949,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"A humble trimmer of the wick, let’s say"
7950,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The wick of Socrates, or Franklin, Paine,"
7951,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Or Jesus as the prophet in the work
7952,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of freeing for the truth, then what of that?"
7953,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Who gets the judgment in the years to come,"
7954,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"A parlor lamp of yellow flame, that smells"
7955,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of coal oil, or your Ott?"
7956,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7957,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,“Let’s take a type:
7958,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"He woos the average man, appeals to him;"
7959,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The average man whose morals, art and books"
7960,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Are just victrola records, microscopic"
7961,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Echoes of small realities of the past.
7962,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,He sees what he can do with this America
7963,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of the average man, the common people called."
7964,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,He follows them and gives them vapid stuff
7965,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of morals, laws and politics. His aim?"
7966,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Talk which will win the very largest nod
7967,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Of ignorant assent. Result? Why look,"
7968,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"He is a daily of a million sale,"
7969,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"He coins the money lecturing, uses too"
7970,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,His following to keep America
7971,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Upon the level of the common man
7972,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"In morals, freedom, thought, virility."
7973,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,He scoffs at science and the noodles giggle.
7974,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Music? Why, who’s Beethoven? Let me hear"
7975,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"‘Lead Kindly Light.’ The drama? Well, Ben Hur"
7976,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Is moral and historical. Sculpture? Look
7977,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,At those bronze figures by the mantel clock--
7978,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,That’s Faith and Hope. Freedom of speech and press?
7979,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Within the limits of the law! And war?
7980,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"I loathe it, I opposed it, but when war"
7981,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Is by the law decreed, I enter too"
7982,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"And howl for what I hissed, for what I called"
7983,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,An evil and a wrong.
7984,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7985,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,“Now hear me out:
7986,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Suppose he could persuade America
7987,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To take his books, and music, sculpture, ethics--"
7988,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"That is his purpose, to persuade us all"
7989,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To take them, as it was the aim of Ott"
7990,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,To stay enlistment and so stop the war--
7991,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,What of our civilization? It would fall.
7992,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"If so who should be jailed, this orator"
7993,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Or Ott?
7994,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
7995,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"“Now we’ve arrived, can test these souls."
7996,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Ott fights the war and sticks, your orator"
7997,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Opposes the war and quotes the Nazarene.
7998,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,But does he stick? Why no! The truth remains.
7999,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"He changes, lifts his nose for noting when"
8000,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,The noses of the majority are lifted.
8001,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Our Mr. Ott winters behind the bars.
8002,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Our orator retires to Florida;
8003,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Emerges slick and strong when April comes
8004,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To lecture, get the money."
8005,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
8006,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,“Now suppose
8007,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Ott by his talk had balked the war, that crime"
8008,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Is nothing by the side of the other crime
8009,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Of keeping common followers commoner;
8010,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Corrupting thought. The war is over now.
8011,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,With Ott in prison and the orator out.
8012,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Let’s test them on the whole, and wholly freed"
8013,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,From war tests; Ott’s a trimmer of great wicks;
8014,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Your orator a parlor lamp that smells
8015,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Of coal oil. And the larger truth would open
8016,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"The prison doors for Ott, and push the orator"
8017,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Behind the doors and lock them.”
8018,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
8019,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Marion Strode
8020,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Went on till we arrived. And there was Ott
8021,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Serene and smiling in his prison clothes.
8022,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
8023,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,“We mean
8024,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"To get a pardon for you,” Marion Strode"
8025,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Spoke out at once, “and give this prison cell"
8026,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,To a certain orator of the commonplace.”
8027,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Ott laughed and said, “What for? You’d break his puerile"
8028,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,And shifty heart. This is a place for men
8029,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,"Who stand their ground. I may not have much brains,"
8030,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,But what I have I use as Socrates
8031,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Devoted his. I want to share the greatness
8032,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Of the great with what brains I possess. I like
8033,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,This cell because it helps me do this.”
8034,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,
8035,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,Then
8036,COMPARATIVE CRIMINALS,We shook the hand of Ott and turned away!

8224,THE INN,Low windows in the room
8225,THE INN,That tunnel the darkness with light!
8226,THE INN,The tick of a clock in the fog that hovers
8227,THE INN,From the cave and slide of the darkness
8228,THE INN,Into the tunnels of light.
8229,THE INN,"A cannon stove, a dog at my feet;"
8230,THE INN,"Cheap magazines on a table,"
8231,THE INN,"Dead flies, an atlas;"
8232,THE INN,"A register for guests,"
8233,THE INN,"And stillness! Not a voice, a step--"
8234,THE INN,Only the tick of the clock!
8235,THE INN,
8236,THE INN,"Mists of Fear, Mists of Memory, swirl and writhe,"
8237,THE INN,"Dive, curl and coil"
8238,THE INN,From the mountain tops.
8239,THE INN,A stretch of ochre grass by the river;
8240,THE INN,Bent trees imploring the sun;
8241,THE INN,And by the inn a road that stretches
8242,THE INN,"Along the river, full of dead dreams, patience,"
8243,THE INN,Weariness long endured!
8244,THE INN,
8245,THE INN,Second morning of rain.
8246,THE INN,"Second morning of separation, death in loneliness!"
8247,THE INN,The wind rushes to the corner of the porch
8248,THE INN,And sighs as it hides.
8249,THE INN,Second morning that I see
8250,THE INN,The walker of the road:
8251,THE INN,"An opera cloak of blue blows round him,"
8252,THE INN,Flaps out a lining of red.
8253,THE INN,And an Alpine hat comes down to his little ears.
8254,THE INN,"He is booted, he limps a little."
8255,THE INN,"But he’s a figure compacted of iron,"
8256,THE INN,He’s master of the landscape;
8257,THE INN,"He has cowed it, kicks it about him,"
8258,THE INN,"As if to say: “A village, a road,"
8259,THE INN,"A river, mountains, rain, an inn,"
8260,THE INN,And a lonely soul in the inn.
8261,THE INN,"Well, what of it? To-morrow Benares,"
8262,THE INN,To-morrow Bactria--who knows?”
8263,THE INN,
8264,THE INN,"And I know as well as I know dead flies,"
8265,THE INN,And the tick of the clock
8266,THE INN,"He wants me, passes the inn to draw me."
8267,THE INN,"Strides to my view, though he never looks in."
8268,THE INN,The flap of his cloak is a gesture;
8269,THE INN,His eyes fixed straight ahead allure.
8270,THE INN,"He is passing again, returns and passes."
8271,THE INN,I can stand no more!
8272,THE INN,
8273,THE INN,"I walk from the room, and haste to his side."
8274,THE INN,A rusty hand out of the blue of his cloak
8275,THE INN,Reaches for mine; silken soft in the palm
8276,THE INN,"Like an anthropoid’s, but boned"
8277,THE INN,To the strength of bronze in the fingers.
8278,THE INN,Red scar on his cheek--a sabre cut!
8279,THE INN,Or was it an aiguille gashed him
8280,THE INN,"When he fell headlong like a meteor,"
8281,THE INN,"And rolled to a valley, got up, shook out,"
8282,THE INN,"And dusted himself, set forth to travel"
8283,THE INN,From Ctesiphon to Sarajevo?...
8284,THE INN,
8285,THE INN,"But now the blue and red,"
8286,THE INN,"The Alpine hat, the little ears,"
8287,THE INN,Against the ochre of stricken grass
8288,THE INN,"Are shrunk to the rust of jowl and jaw,"
8289,THE INN,"And the scar, like lips grown to;"
8290,THE INN,And the smile of Jenghiz Khan....
8291,THE INN,His voice is the lowest octave
8292,THE INN,"Of riotous thought, conscienceless as nature."
8293,THE INN,"No talk, much thought. The earth’s a treadmill,"
8294,THE INN,"And spheres back of us to toes dug in,"
8295,THE INN,Until we come to a mountain lake
8296,THE INN,Clear and calm as a sky.
8297,THE INN,Green shadows rich as moss around the shores;
8298,THE INN,"Clouds, clear blues at the centre!"
8299,THE INN,"We are bending over, see each other’s faces"
8300,THE INN,In the water.
8301,THE INN,"What was it? Red scar on his cheek,"
8302,THE INN,Or red feather in the Alpine hat?
8303,THE INN,I thrill! For I see his eyes at last;
8304,THE INN,"They are the fires of burning cities,"
8305,THE INN,"Carthage, Athens."
8306,THE INN,Quick! And we are lying
8307,THE INN,Looking up into the sky.
8308,THE INN,When a whiff of rotting men--I turn
8309,THE INN,But he stays me with his hand.
8310,THE INN,The scent passes--he talks
8311,THE INN,To me--the sky!
8312,THE INN,
8313,THE INN,"“I am a soul fancier and catcher,"
8314,THE INN,"A catcher and cager of birds,"
8315,THE INN,"Whether they be kites, condors, cormorants,"
8316,THE INN,"Crows, cow-birds, vultures,"
8317,THE INN,"Or martins, mocking-birds, or hawks,"
8318,THE INN,"Shrikes, orioles, clarindas, thrushes,"
8319,THE INN,"Songsters, or scavengers, I catch them,"
8320,THE INN,"And in these mountains, call them of memory"
8321,THE INN,"Or bitter reflection,"
8322,THE INN,I cage them.
8323,THE INN,But to be brief: Your bird of prey I catch
8324,THE INN,By luring him with carrion;
8325,THE INN,And your mocking bird with sounds
8326,THE INN,"Sweet as his own soul’s echo, as it were"
8327,THE INN,"Unreal made real. But whether bird of prey,"
8328,THE INN,"Or songster, it’s to fool them"
8329,THE INN,"Always, until my hand cups over so--"
8330,THE INN,"Then a cottage, in the mountains of memory!"
8331,THE INN,
8332,THE INN,“I prize the soul called mocking bird
8333,THE INN,"Mimetic of all spirits, would be all,"
8334,THE INN,"Self-fooler, and world fooler!"
8335,THE INN,"Coos in scourged kingdoms like the dove,"
8336,THE INN,Presaging peace;
8337,THE INN,Croaks like the eagle where the serfs implore
8338,THE INN,Omens and leadership.
8339,THE INN,"I caught one lately, big as any crow."
8340,THE INN,And cooped him--you shall see!
8341,THE INN,"But first as far as Prague, borne over seas,"
8342,THE INN,"I heard the eagle, yes, was nearly fooled,"
8343,THE INN,"Me, the expert in songsters, souls!"
8344,THE INN,I looked my soul-bird up and found
8345,THE INN,My eagle was a mocking-bird;
8346,THE INN,"And when he croaked of counsel and debate,"
8347,THE INN,"And breathing bracing air of matching minds,"
8348,THE INN,He was the mocking bird embowered and hidden
8349,THE INN,"In scented leaves of dreams,"
8350,THE INN,"And sang what he would be, but could not be!"
8351,THE INN,"A lyrist who sang down seclusion, still"
8352,THE INN,Could live nowhere but in concealment.
8353,THE INN,"A seeker of sweet notes from rich thesauri,"
8354,THE INN,Slaved to the habit of the lexicon.
8355,THE INN,I would not catch him yet! Believe me now
8356,THE INN,"There is that in each soul which builds its cage,"
8357,THE INN,"Achieves its capture, be it thirst or lust,"
8358,THE INN,"A lexicon or rhetoric, singing notes"
8359,THE INN,Which makes the world say: ‘Hear the eagle cry!’
8360,THE INN,"The world is fooled, but not the self is fooled;"
8361,THE INN,"It sleeps, submits to singing, but arouses"
8362,THE INN,"When soul is highest charmed with its own song,"
8363,THE INN,"And at the apex of the life, and treats"
8364,THE INN,The man as mocking bird for what he is!...
8365,THE INN,"The self as mocking bird betrays and leads,"
8366,THE INN,"Not eagle-wings, but weak wings to the fray,"
8367,THE INN,And there the realest self is seen at last
8368,THE INN,Of self and all. To capture them or slay
8369,THE INN,Is where I come and act.
8370,THE INN,
8371,THE INN,"“Sweet bird of dawning, dreaming of Fourteen,"
8372,THE INN,"Who carried Christ across a stream,"
8373,THE INN,"And gained the magic sack,"
8374,THE INN,Into the which whatever he wished would come
8375,THE INN,When saying Artchila and Murtchila.
8376,THE INN,"But, he, this Fourteen, bird of dawning, mock-bird"
8377,THE INN,How could he carry Christ? What magic bag
8378,THE INN,"Would gather in, to words like ‘counsel,’ ‘process’?"
8379,THE INN,So charmed with voice of self he flew alone
8380,THE INN,"To a parley of fowls. And there amid rich crumbs,"
8381,THE INN,"Silk vestured falconers, birds of paradise,"
8382,THE INN,"Mock eagle fails, but true to song"
8383,THE INN,Utters what self of him destroys him for.
8384,THE INN,"Then I, to end, come in!"
8385,THE INN,
8386,THE INN,“Wouldn’t you think he’d know what had been done
8387,THE INN,"To him, his counsels, processes?"
8388,THE INN,"Voice of the eagle sometimes, but the talons"
8389,THE INN,"And wings, where were they?"
8390,THE INN,"How was he Christopherus, how Fourteen?"
8391,THE INN,I step in here and send him
8392,THE INN,"On a great tour of singing, laugh in my sleeve"
8393,THE INN,To see him start with his empty magic bag--
8394,THE INN,"Empty? Great wars to come and woes,"
8395,THE INN,"Hatreds and desolations, blight of unfaith,"
8396,THE INN,And distillate of night-shade: Soul’s despair
8397,THE INN,Were in the bag now.
8398,THE INN,"But I forget--all could not see these in it,"
8399,THE INN,"Though most could see an empty bag. Well, now"
8400,THE INN,My project was to send him forth to chant
8401,THE INN,"The rhetoric of a life-time, tent him to"
8402,THE INN,"The repetend and echo, the refrain"
8403,THE INN,"That hides a hollow courage, and a brain"
8404,THE INN,"Tired of its make-believe, and borrowed moods."
8405,THE INN,"My plan went further: Thus to send him forth,"
8406,THE INN,And in keen lighting have him see himself
8407,THE INN,As some ten thousand saw him; in one moment
8408,THE INN,Together by him and them! flash picture
8409,THE INN,"Photographed on a mountain’s wall,"
8410,THE INN,And visible for ages! So it was!
8411,THE INN,"I laughed, but being master I could pity...."
8412,THE INN,"My hand goes over him cup-like now, shuts eyes"
8413,THE INN,"From sight of how he pecked me peevishly,"
8414,THE INN,Like a stud-sparrow shrilled. Time for the cage
8415,THE INN,"For our mock-eagle, logolyrist, truly!--"
8416,THE INN,You shall know them by their words.”
8417,THE INN,
8418,THE INN,"“How’s this so quick, on a peak?”"
8419,THE INN,"I said, for there we were, and the lake lost."
8420,THE INN,"Below us the plum world, pitted with gums: oceans."
8421,THE INN,Streaked with streams: white-wash excrement of sparrows;
8422,THE INN,Pine forests: fuzz on the rind; lice green and brown: men.
8423,THE INN,I bawl in his ear against the breeze
8424,THE INN,Whirl-pooled around us:
8425,THE INN,"“No Jesus business, no Budda business,"
8426,THE INN,I wouldn’t give a damn for it all.”
8427,THE INN,"“You lie,” he said. “You’re like the rest"
8428,THE INN,"Esophagus, coil of guts, a vent.”"
8429,THE INN,“Man is a spirit.” “Man is a smell.”
8430,THE INN,Just then up from the world’s valley a breeze
8431,THE INN,Bearing the stench of ten million corpses--
8432,THE INN,“Hey! I faint.”
8433,THE INN,"I back away, bump into a cottage wall, a door"
8434,THE INN,Which opens--and there
8435,THE INN,"Is logolyrist caged, in durance,"
8436,THE INN,"Twittering to himself the habitual notes,"
8437,THE INN,"Impotent, damned, alone!"
8438,THE INN,
8439,THE INN,"“Night comes quickly these days,” says the landlady"
8440,THE INN,Lighting the lamp. I stretch out of sleep
8441,THE INN,And pat the head of an honest dog.

8595,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"As big as mine. He started to play bear,"
8596,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And took me in his arms and hugged me so
8597,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,I felt my ribs crack. Then I wondered when
8598,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"He had quit wearing stockings and knee breeches,"
8599,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And when it was he slipped to seventeen,"
8600,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Became a man.
8601,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,
8602,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And so the war came on.
8603,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"He tried to be a flyer, for he knew"
8604,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,What engines were and all about machines
8605,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And he knew trigonometry, and chemistry,"
8606,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And wireless telegraphy--but his age
8607,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Debarred him from the flyers; so he chafed
8608,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And did not whistle as he used to do,"
8609,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,But growled a little like a yearling bear.
8610,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And then his face grew bright again: he had gone,"
8611,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Enlisted in the army, came to me,"
8612,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,His face all glowing: “Everything I am
8613,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"You taught to me,” he said; “to love the truth,"
8614,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,To love democracy and America.
8615,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And now we have a war, the very first"
8616,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,When men could fight to bring democracy.
8617,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Our country turned against the revolution
8618,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"In France, which was a democratic cause,"
8619,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,But now we war to bring democracy
8620,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"To peoples everywhere, and I am off."
8621,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"God moves among us, and to serve and die"
8622,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Are blessings, I am happy, and am off.”"
8623,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,
8624,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"He terrified me with his shining face,"
8625,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"His blue eyes, beautiful body, slim and strong."
8626,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"St. George was not more beautiful. I was awed,"
8627,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And said to him: “You terrify me, boy."
8628,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"There are plenty of men to go, await the call;"
8629,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Go if they call you, but you have your school,"
8630,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And if you go you’ll never go to school
8631,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Again, and that will leave you half prepared"
8632,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"For life, you’ll feel it all the rest of life.”"
8633,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,But he stood up so straight and stern and shining
8634,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And said: “I owe this service to you, Dad,"
8635,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"For what you’ve been and taught me, and I owe it"
8636,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,To God and to my country.” So it was
8637,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"He terrified me, and I said: “My boy,"
8638,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"I am not wise enough, after all, to say"
8639,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,What you should do. Perhaps you have a vision--
8640,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,You are America come to herself;
8641,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,A vision and a mission and a glory
8642,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Perhaps, perhaps. I step aside. Go on!”"
8643,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,
8644,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"They took him to a camp, and in a week"
8645,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,I went to see him. He was in a pen
8646,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Like a prize porker, looked a little down."
8647,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He had been shot with vaccines of all sorts.
8648,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He didn’t say much. Two weeks after that
8649,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,I saw him and he had a cold he caught
8650,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,From doing picket duty in the rain
8651,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And sleeping on a mattress soaked with rain.
8652,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"The food was pretty good, not very good."
8653,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He whispered: “All the pin-heads in the world
8654,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Have got the jobs of officers. I’m surprised.
8655,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"I know more mathematics than they do,"
8656,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And more of everything. I thought an officer
8657,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Was educated. Well, I am surprised.”"
8658,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He said the boys were dying right and left
8659,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Because they had no care. And on a day
8660,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,When he came home to visit for a while
8661,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He was stricken with the flu. I telephoned
8662,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"The officer, who raved and said no trick"
8663,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Would go with him. He’d send for him. He did,"
8664,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And took him out with a raging temperature,"
8665,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And back to camp. He almost died for that.
8666,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And, when he got up, wobbled for some weeks."
8667,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And about the time he stood up fairly strong
8668,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,They shipped him off to Europe; and they went
8669,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Yelling like tigers smelling blood, and God"
8670,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Seemed farthest from their thoughts.
8671,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,
8672,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Well, so it went."
8673,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And after while we had the armistice,"
8674,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"The war was over, but no letter came."
8675,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Where was he? Dead? We couldn’t learn a thing.
8676,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Until at last this boy who went to fight
8677,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,For God and for democracy landed up
8678,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"In Russia fighting democracy, as America"
8679,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Fought France in eighteen hundred--for a letter
8680,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Came to us telling where he was. And there
8681,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He stayed some months and fought for covenants
8682,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Arrived at in the open, independence"
8683,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Of little and big peoples, for the sea’s"
8684,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Freedom, or democracy, I’m not sure,"
8685,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"For one of these or all, I am not sure."
8686,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"He got through anyway, or they got through"
8687,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"With him, perhaps, for he came back at last,"
8688,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"One eye out and one leg gone, and he’d lost"
8689,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"God, so he said, and didn’t use the word"
8690,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Democracy at all, and, as for war,"
8691,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,He said to me: “What is it? Everything
8692,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Has its own idea, and the idea of war"
8693,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Is killing people? That’s our job, that’s war!"
8694,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And everybody yells atrocities,"
8695,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And everybody does ’em--what the hell
8696,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Do people think war is, a Sunday School?"
8697,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"I want some money, Dad, for I am broke;"
8698,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And I can’t work at much now, and, by God,"
8699,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,I think I’ll write my story. So they’ll know
8700,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"They use you, and they fool you, and you die"
8701,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"That some one may make money selling stuff,"
8702,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,Or grab off lands or commerce. Hell’s delight!
8703,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"When I was sick in Russia, had delusions,"
8704,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,I saw a snake so big he wrapped the world
8705,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,And swallowed it with everybody in it.
8706,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"You see, the snake’s the money-men, big business,"
8707,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"The schemers, human buzzards, who eat up"
8708,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Young fellows and the kids, and lay on fat"
8709,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,With fresh young blood that wants to shed itself
8710,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,For God and truth! I killed a Russian soldier
8711,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"And said: ‘You bastard,’ as I stuck him through,"
8712,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"You hate yourself, so you just kill to glut"
8713,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Your hatred of yourself, your cruelty"
8714,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"Which lusts, as it can masquerade behind"
8715,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,"The mask of duty. Give me a dollar, Dad,"
8716,GOD AND MY COUNTRY,To get some cigarettes and some shaving blades.”

8736,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"The dunes are a quilt of yellow, green and gray"
8737,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Spread to the Calumet River.
8738,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Peaked by giant children who play
8739,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Circus with feet for poles. Fantastic dunes,"
8740,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Protean hills, and migratory tents"
8741,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Of invisible gypsies, changing with the moon’s"
8742,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Replenished and exhausted valleys of light.
8743,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Forests of pine and oak arise
8744,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"On many a height,"
8745,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,And down the steep descents
8746,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Flourish and vanish from sight,"
8747,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Under the restless feet of the wandering hills.
8748,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,They trace in sand the changes of the skies
8749,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,When the sun of evening smelts
8750,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Great towers of cloud or battlements,"
8751,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"And levels them, or warps"
8752,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Their shapes to broken walls,"
8753,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Or twisted scraps,"
8754,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Or floors of emerald strewn with lion pelts....
8755,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Here there are water-falls;
8756,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Lakes bright as mercury, and pools"
8757,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Green as the mosses, where hepaticas"
8758,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,And asters scurry before the gesturing wind;
8759,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Cool hollows, scented brakes"
8760,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Of bramble, fern and cane;"
8761,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Great marshes where the flags leap like green snakes,"
8762,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Bordered with garish gules
8763,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Of pye-weed; over whose wastes the crane
8764,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Flaps the slow rhythm of extended wings.
8765,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,And on whose reeds the blackbird sings
8766,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"A quaver of blue water, March’s fire."
8767,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,
8768,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Between the feet of the dunes and the trampling troops
8769,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Of waves along the shore the sand is pounded
8770,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Into a broad mosaic firm and smooth,"
8771,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Whereon are strewn old reels, between the groups"
8772,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Of blackened hut and booth.
8773,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Boats lie here where they grounded,"
8774,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Like skeletons in the desert ribbed and black,"
8775,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Scaled with the water’s scurf.
8776,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,
8777,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,The shore is the moat between the ruined rampart
8778,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Of the dunes, whose shifting is stayed"
8779,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"By splotches of thickets, trees and turf,"
8780,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,And the invading surf.
8781,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Here phantom mists descend, and the wrack"

8785,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,There is forever here the futile fashioning
8786,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Of hills, and their leveling;"
8787,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,The growth of forests and their burial;
8788,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,Pools filled and rivers changed or dried

8794,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"Toward the blue of the lake, a hundred feet below."
8795,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,"They have been sand, now being blossoms drift"
8796,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,With the winds whose spirit cannot be

8798,THE DUNES OF INDIANA,By night they howl or whine

8821,NATURE,As a spider winds the nerve white gossamer
8822,NATURE,"From its own being, and unwinding sails"
8823,NATURE,"The heights--the secrets of the stars, the sheer"
8824,NATURE,"Chasms of space, and tears the vaporous veils"
8825,NATURE,From Force and Distance. Nature! At the last
8826,NATURE,Our breast of consolation! Man exhales
8827,NATURE,Thereon the spirit which was an him cast
8828,NATURE,From that same breast at birth. But what you are
8829,NATURE,"Remains, or on the mind of man is glassed"
8830,NATURE,"As you, remaining; while the farthest star,"
8831,NATURE,"The changing moon, the lessening sun, the sands"
8832,NATURE,Of buried cities toll our calendar
8833,NATURE,"Of dying days. Waters by star light, lands"
8834,NATURE,"That slip or climb; leaves, blossoms, fruits contain"
8835,NATURE,"The flesh of wonder perished, and the hands"
8836,NATURE,"That sought with zeal or laughter, but in pain"
8837,NATURE,"To know you and themselves. Still nourishing,"
8838,NATURE,"Destroying, but unriddled, you remain!"
8839,NATURE,
8840,NATURE,Immeasurable Arc! To which our brief existence
8841,NATURE,"Is a point, if relative, not understood."
8842,NATURE,"With you endowed with motion and persistence,"
8843,NATURE,"Contained within you, is life evil, good?"
8844,NATURE,Is life not of you? Is there aught without
8845,NATURE,By which to judge this restless brotherhood
8846,NATURE,"Of will and water, and to quiet doubt"
8847,NATURE,That life is good? And may the scheme deny
8848,NATURE,"Itself when it is all, and rules throughout,"
8849,NATURE,"Knows no defeat, except as forces vie"
8850,NATURE,"Within it, striving? But, O Nature, you"
8851,NATURE,"Mother of suns and systems, what can lie"
8852,NATURE,"As God beyond you, making you untrue"
8853,NATURE,To larger truth or being? You are all!
8854,NATURE,And man who moves within you may imbrue
8855,NATURE,"His hands in war, or famine on him fall"
8856,NATURE,"Out of your eyeless genius, yet what wrong"
8857,NATURE,"Is wrought to your creating, magical"
8858,NATURE,"Renewal, scheme? What arbiter more strong"
8859,NATURE,Than you are judges discord for the strife
8860,NATURE,"That stirs upon our earth, wherever throng"
8861,NATURE,"Thoughts, forces, fires. What is evil? Life!"
8862,NATURE,"Even as life is struggle, whether it smite,"
8863,NATURE,"Or lift, as waves to waves in will are rife"
8864,NATURE,"With enmity. Whatever is, is right."
8865,NATURE,Like insects on a drift weed water tossed
8866,NATURE,"The sea of nature moves in man’s despite,"
8867,NATURE,While generations flourish and are lost.
8868,NATURE,
8869,NATURE,Ether of the ethereal energy
8870,NATURE,Which whirls the atoms: Will in man. And soul
8871,NATURE,Which is to light as light to flame: the free
8872,NATURE,Soaring of man’s thought. This is the dole
8873,NATURE,And tragedy of man: He has outgrown
8874,NATURE,"His kinship with the beasts that kept him whole,"
8875,NATURE,"Through thought, which is not instinct, but would own"
8876,NATURE,The unerring realm of instinct. Like a sun
8877,NATURE,"He flares his thought in storms of fire, has flown"
8878,NATURE,"His symmetry and sphere, has wandered, won"
8879,NATURE,"No orbit for the beast’s, which he has marred,"
8880,NATURE,"Departed from; must finish what’s begun,"
8881,NATURE,"Until he be in spirit moved and starred,"
8882,NATURE,"Instinct regained to thought, his sun created"
8883,NATURE,As far as flames have leaped; or leave the scarred
8884,NATURE,Black cavities of his hopes to beings fated
8885,NATURE,To grow therefrom to what he failed to reach.
8886,NATURE,"Something within him drew the gods, and mated"
8887,NATURE,His spirit to celestial powers. The breach
8888,NATURE,Between him and the beast is fixed. He sinks
8889,NATURE,"In tangled madness, anger, railing speech,"
8890,NATURE,"Below the ape, or else he rises, links"
8891,NATURE,"His being to a life to which he climbs,"
8892,NATURE,"A realm of thought harmonious, while he thinks."
8893,NATURE,"This is the tragedy of man, and Time’s"
8894,NATURE,Colossal task laid on him: Roll he must
8895,NATURE,"The stone up to the peak against the slimes,"
8896,NATURE,"And fasten it, or let it make him dust,"
8897,NATURE,"Escaped his hand and crushing, still confess"
8898,NATURE,"That you, O Mighty Mother, still are just"
8899,NATURE,"Who fling him down to failure, nothingness."
8900,NATURE,This is the tragedy of man: to learn
8901,NATURE,"Your secret wishes, having learned to press"
8902,NATURE,"The heights of life, or ignorant still to burn"
8903,NATURE,With questioning; and on this stage of earth
8904,NATURE,"Live as they lived of old in a return,"
8905,NATURE,"Endless of useless labor, madder mirth."
8906,NATURE,
8907,NATURE,"Labor or Mirth! No matter--but to man,"
8908,NATURE,And for an hour! And after that the sleep.
8909,NATURE,Waking or sleeping man fulfills the plan
8910,NATURE,"Of you, O Mother. Other thought may creep"
8911,NATURE,"On man’s defeated spirit, make him say"
8912,NATURE,"That you should weep, O Mother, if he weep."
8913,NATURE,But we are but ephemera in a play
8914,NATURE,"Of tangled sun light, and the universe"
8915,NATURE,"Of ages counts the minutes of our day,"
8916,NATURE,And makes them of the ages. And the curse
8917,NATURE,That man deems his is not upon the far
8918,NATURE,And infinite existence. It could nurse
8919,NATURE,"No evil in great spaces, sun and star"
8920,NATURE,"As great as man’s to man, and not lie down"
8921,NATURE,To death as man does. Hence if you unbar
8922,NATURE,"To us, O Nature, nothing better, crown"
8923,NATURE,"Our hour with folly still, you give us rest"
8924,NATURE,"Among the mountains, meadows, and unclown"
8925,NATURE,"Our idiot brows, and on your infinite breast"
8926,NATURE,Rock us eternally under the infinite sky.
