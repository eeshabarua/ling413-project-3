56,THE IRON GATE,
57,THE IRON GATE,Read at the Breakfast given in honor of Dr. Holmes's Seventieth Birthday
58,THE IRON GATE,"by the publishers of the ""Atlantic  Monthly,"" Boston, December 3, 1879."
59,THE IRON GATE,
60,THE IRON GATE,WHERE is this patriarch you are kindly greeting?
61,THE IRON GATE,"Not unfamiliar to my ear his name,"
62,THE IRON GATE,Nor yet unknown to many a joyous meeting
63,THE IRON GATE,"In days long vanished,--is he still the same,"
64,THE IRON GATE,
65,THE IRON GATE,"Or changed by years, forgotten and forgetting,"
66,THE IRON GATE,"Dull-eared, dim-sighted, slow of speech and thought,"
67,THE IRON GATE,"Still o'er the sad, degenerate present fretting,"
68,THE IRON GATE,"Where all goes wrong, and nothing as it ought?"
69,THE IRON GATE,
70,THE IRON GATE,"Old age, the graybeard! Well, indeed, I know him,--"
71,THE IRON GATE,"Shrunk, tottering, bent, of aches and ills the prey;"
72,THE IRON GATE,"In sermon, story, fable, picture, poem,"
73,THE IRON GATE,Oft have I met him from my earliest day.
74,THE IRON GATE,
75,THE IRON GATE,"In my old AEsop, toiling with his bundle,--"
76,THE IRON GATE,"His load of sticks,--politely asking Death,"
77,THE IRON GATE,"Who comes when called for,--would he lug or trundle"
78,THE IRON GATE,His fagot for him?--he was scant of breath.
79,THE IRON GATE,
80,THE IRON GATE,"And sad ""Ecclesiastes, or the Preacher,""--"
81,THE IRON GATE,"Has he not stamped the image on my soul,"
82,THE IRON GATE,"In that last chapter, where the worn-out Teacher"
83,THE IRON GATE,"Sighs o'er the loosened cord, the broken bowl?"
84,THE IRON GATE,
85,THE IRON GATE,"Yes, long, indeed, I've known him at a distance,"
86,THE IRON GATE,And now my lifted door-latch shows him here;
87,THE IRON GATE,"I take his shrivelled hand without resistance,"
88,THE IRON GATE,And find him smiling as his step draws near.
89,THE IRON GATE,
90,THE IRON GATE,"What though of gilded baubles he bereaves us,"
91,THE IRON GATE,"Dear to the heart of youth, to manhood's prime;"
92,THE IRON GATE,"Think of the calm he brings, the wealth he leaves us,"
93,THE IRON GATE,"The hoarded spoils, the legacies of time!"
94,THE IRON GATE,
95,THE IRON GATE,"Altars once flaming, still with incense fragrant,"
96,THE IRON GATE,"Passion's uneasy nurslings rocked asleep,"
97,THE IRON GATE,"Hope's anchor faster, wild desire less vagrant,"
98,THE IRON GATE,"Life's flow less noisy, but the stream how deep!"
99,THE IRON GATE,
100,THE IRON GATE,"Still as the silver cord gets worn and slender,"
101,THE IRON GATE,"Its lightened task-work tugs with lessening strain,"
102,THE IRON GATE,"Hands get more helpful, voices, grown more tender,"
103,THE IRON GATE,Soothe with their softened tones the slumberous brain.
104,THE IRON GATE,
105,THE IRON GATE,"Youth longs and manhood strives, but age remembers,"
106,THE IRON GATE,"Sits by the raked-up ashes of the past,"
107,THE IRON GATE,Spreads its thin hands above the whitening embers
108,THE IRON GATE,That warm its creeping life-blood till the last.
109,THE IRON GATE,
110,THE IRON GATE,Dear to its heart is every loving token
111,THE IRON GATE,"That comes unbidden ere its pulse grows cold,"
112,THE IRON GATE,"Ere the last lingering ties of life are broken,"
113,THE IRON GATE,Its labors ended and its story told.
114,THE IRON GATE,
115,THE IRON GATE,"Ah, while around us rosy youth rejoices,"
116,THE IRON GATE,"For us the sorrow-laden breezes sigh,"
117,THE IRON GATE,And through the chorus of its jocund voices
118,THE IRON GATE,Throbs the sharp note of misery's hopeless cry.
119,THE IRON GATE,
120,THE IRON GATE,As on the gauzy wings of fancy flying
121,THE IRON GATE,"From some far orb I track our watery sphere,"
122,THE IRON GATE,"Home of the struggling, suffering, doubting, dying,"
123,THE IRON GATE,The silvered globule seems a glistening tear.
124,THE IRON GATE,
125,THE IRON GATE,But Nature lends her mirror of illusion
126,THE IRON GATE,"To win from saddening scenes our age-dimmed eyes,"
127,THE IRON GATE,And misty day-dreams blend in sweet confusion
128,THE IRON GATE,The wintry landscape and the summer skies.
129,THE IRON GATE,
130,THE IRON GATE,"So when the iron portal shuts behind us,"
131,THE IRON GATE,"And life forgets us in its noise and whirl,"
132,THE IRON GATE,"Visions that shunned the glaring noonday find us,"
133,THE IRON GATE,And glimmering starlight shows the gates of pearl.
134,THE IRON GATE,
135,THE IRON GATE,"I come not here your morning hour to sadden,"
136,THE IRON GATE,"A limping pilgrim, leaning on his staff,--"
137,THE IRON GATE,"I, who have never deemed it sin to gladden"
138,THE IRON GATE,This vale of sorrows with a wholesome laugh.
139,THE IRON GATE,
140,THE IRON GATE,"If word of mine another's gloom has brightened,"
141,THE IRON GATE,Through my dumb lips the heaven-sent message came;
142,THE IRON GATE,"If hand of mine another's task has lightened,"
143,THE IRON GATE,It felt the guidance that it dares not claim.
144,THE IRON GATE,
145,THE IRON GATE,"But, O my gentle sisters, O my brothers,"
146,THE IRON GATE,These thick-sown snow-flakes hint of toil's release;
147,THE IRON GATE,These feebler pulses bid me leave to others
148,THE IRON GATE,The tasks once welcome; evening asks for peace.
149,THE IRON GATE,
150,THE IRON GATE,Time claims his tribute; silence now is golden;
151,THE IRON GATE,Let me not vex the too long suffering lyre;
152,THE IRON GATE,"Though to your love untiring still beholden,"
153,THE IRON GATE,The curfew tells me--cover up the fire.
154,THE IRON GATE,
155,THE IRON GATE,"And now with grateful smile and accents cheerful,"
156,THE IRON GATE,"And warmer heart than look or word can tell,"
157,THE IRON GATE,In simplest phrase--these traitorous eyes are tearful--
158,THE IRON GATE,"Thanks, Brothers, Sisters,--Children,--and farewell!"
159,THE IRON GATE,
160,THE IRON GATE,
161,THE IRON GATE,
162,THE IRON GATE,

167,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
168,AN ACADEMIC POEM,1829-1879
169,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
170,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Read at the Commencement Dinner of the Alumni of Harvard
171,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"University, June 25, 1879."
172,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
173,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"WHILE fond, sad memories all around us throng,"
174,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Silence were sweeter than the sweetest song;
175,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Yet when the leaves are green and heaven is blue,"
176,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"The choral tribute of the grove is due,"
177,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And when the lengthening nights have chilled the skies,"
178,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"We fain would hear the song-bird ere be flies,"
179,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And greet with kindly welcome, even as now,"
180,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The lonely minstrel on his leafless bough.
181,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
182,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"This is our golden year,--its golden day;"
183,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Its bridal memories soon must pass away;
184,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Soon shall its dying music cease to ring,"
185,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And every year must loose some silver string,"
186,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Till the last trembling chords no longer thrill,--"
187,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Hands all at rest and hearts forever still.
188,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
189,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A few gray heads have joined the forming line;
190,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"We hear our summons,--""Class of 'Twenty-Nine!"""
191,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Close on the foremost, and, alas, how few!"
192,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Are these ""The Boys"" our dear old Mother knew?"
193,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Sixty brave swimmers. Twenty--something more--
194,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Have passed the stream and reached this frosty shore!
195,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
196,AN ACADEMIC POEM,How near the banks these fifty years divide
197,AN ACADEMIC POEM,When memory crosses with a single stride!
198,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"'T is the first year of stern ""Old Hickory"" 's rule"
199,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"When our good Mother lets us out of school,"
200,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Half glad, half sorrowing, it must be confessed,"
201,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"To leave her quiet lap, her bounteous breast,"
202,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Armed with our dainty, ribbon-tied degrees,"
203,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Pleased and yet pensive, exiles and A. B.'s."
204,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
205,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Look back, O comrades, with your faded eyes,"
206,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And see the phantoms as I bid them rise.
207,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Whose smile is that? Its pattern Nature gave,"
208,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A sunbeam dancing in a dimpled wave;
209,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"KIRKLAND alone such grace from Heaven could win,"
210,AN ACADEMIC POEM,His features radiant as the soul within;
211,AN ACADEMIC POEM,That smile would let him through Saint Peter's gate
212,AN ACADEMIC POEM,While sad-eyed martyrs had to stand and wait.
213,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Here flits mercurial _Farrar_; standing there,"
214,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"See mild, benignant, cautious, learned _Ware_,"
215,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And sturdy, patient, faithful, honest _Hedge_,"
216,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Whose grinding logic gave our wits their edge;
217,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"_Ticknor_, with honeyed voice and courtly grace;"
218,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And _Willard_, larynxed like a double bass;"
219,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And _Channing_, with his bland, superior look,"
220,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Cool as a moonbeam on a frozen brook,"
221,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
222,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"While the pale student, shivering in his shoes,"
223,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Sees from his theme the turgid rhetoric ooze;
224,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And the born soldier, fate decreed to wreak"
225,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"His martial manhood on a class in Greek,"
226,AN ACADEMIC POEM,_Popkin_! How that explosive name recalls
227,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The grand old Busby of our ancient halls
228,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Such faces looked from Skippon's grim platoons,"
229,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Such figures rode with Ireton's stout dragoons:
230,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"He gave his strength to learning's gentle charms,"
231,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"But every accent sounded ""Shoulder arms!"""
232,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
233,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Names,--empty names! Save only here and there"
234,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Some white-haired listener, dozing in his chair,"
235,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Starts at the sound he often used to hear,"
236,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And upward slants his Sunday-sermon ear.
237,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And we--our blooming manhood we regain;
238,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Smiling we join the long Commencement train,"
239,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"One point first battled in discussion hot,--"
240,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Shall we wear gowns? and settled: We will not.
241,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"How strange the scene,--that noisy boy-debate"
242,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where embryo-speakers learn to rule the State!
243,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"This broad-browed youth, sedate and sober-eyed,"
244,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Shall wear the ermined robe at Taney's side;
245,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And he, the stripling, smooth of face and slight,"
246,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Whose slender form scarce intercepts the light,"
247,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Shall rule the Bench where Parsons gave the law,"
248,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And sphinx-like sat uncouth, majestic Shaw"
249,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Ah, many a star has shed its fatal ray"
250,AN ACADEMIC POEM,On names we loved--our brothers--where are they?
251,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
252,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Nor these alone; our hearts in silence claim
253,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Names not less dear, unsyllabled by fame."
254,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
255,AN ACADEMIC POEM,How brief the space! and yet it sweeps us back
256,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Far, far along our new-born history's track"
257,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Five strides like this;--the sachem rules the land;
258,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The Indian wigwams cluster where we stand.
259,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
260,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The second. Lo! a scene of deadly strife--
261,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A nation struggling into infant life;
262,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Not yet the fatal game at Yorktown won
263,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where failing Empire fired its sunset gun.
264,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"LANGDON sits restless in the ancient chair,--"
265,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Harvard's grave Head,--these echoes heard his prayer"
266,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"When from yon mansion, dear to memory still,"
267,AN ACADEMIC POEM,The banded yeomen marched for Bunker's Hill.
268,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Count on the grave triennial's thick-starred roll
269,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"What names were numbered on the lengthening scroll,--"
270,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Not unfamiliar in our ears they ring,--"
271,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Winthrop, Hale, Eliot, Everett, Dexter, Tyng."
272,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
273,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Another stride. Once more at 'twenty-nine,--"
274,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"GOD SAVE KING GEORGE, the Second of his line!"
275,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And is Sir Isaac living? Nay, not so,--"
276,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"He followed Flainsteed two short years ago,--"
277,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And what about the little hump-backed man
278,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Who pleased the bygone days of good Queen Anne?
279,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"What, Pope? another book he's just put out,--"
280,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"""The Dunciad,""--witty, but profane, no doubt."
281,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
282,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where's Cotton Mather? he was always here.
283,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"And so he would be, but he died last year."
284,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Who is this preacher our Northampton claims,"
285,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Whose rhetoric blazes with sulphureous flames
286,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And torches stolen from Tartarean mines?
287,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Edwards, the salamander of divines."
288,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"A deep, strong nature, pure and undefiled;"
289,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Faith, firm as his who stabbed his sleeping child;"
290,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Alas for him who blindly strays apart,"
291,AN ACADEMIC POEM,And seeking God has lost his human heart!
292,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Fall where they might, no flying cinders caught"
293,AN ACADEMIC POEM,These sober halls where WADSWORTH ruled and
294,AN ACADEMIC POEM,taught.
295,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
296,AN ACADEMIC POEM,One footstep more; the fourth receding stride
297,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Leaves the round century on the nearer side.
298,AN ACADEMIC POEM,GOD SAVE KING CHARLES! God knows that pleasant knave
299,AN ACADEMIC POEM,His grace will find it hard enough to save.
300,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Ten years and more, and now the Plague, the Fire,"
301,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Talk of all tongues, at last begin to tire;"
302,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"One fear prevails, all other frights forgot,--"
303,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"White lips are whispering,--hark! The Popish Plot!"
304,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Happy New England, from such troubles free"
305,AN ACADEMIC POEM,In health and peace beyond the stormy sea!
306,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"No Romish daggers threat her children's throats,"
307,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"No gibbering nightmare mutters ""Titus Oates;"""
308,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Philip is slain, the Quaker graves are green,"
309,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Not yet the witch has entered on the scene;
310,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Happy our Harvard; pleased her graduates four;
311,AN ACADEMIC POEM,URIAN OAKES the name their parchments bore.
312,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
313,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Two centuries past, our hurried feet arrive"
314,AN ACADEMIC POEM,At the last footprint of the scanty five;
315,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Take the fifth stride; our wandering eyes explore
316,AN ACADEMIC POEM,A tangled forest on a trackless shore;
317,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Here, where we stand, the savage sorcerer howls,"
318,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"The wild cat snarls, the stealthy gray wolf prowls,"
319,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"The slouching bear, perchance the trampling moose"
320,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Starts the brown squaw and scares her red pappoose;
321,AN ACADEMIC POEM,At every step the lurking foe is near;
322,AN ACADEMIC POEM,His Demons reign; God has no temple here!
323,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
324,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Lift up your eyes! behold these pictured walls;
325,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Look where the flood of western glory falls
326,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Through the great sunflower disk of blazing panes
327,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"In ruby, saffron, azure, emerald stains;"
328,AN ACADEMIC POEM,With reverent step the marble pavement tread
329,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Where our proud Mother's martyr-roll is read;
330,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"See the great halls that cluster, gathering round"
331,AN ACADEMIC POEM,This lofty shrine with holiest memories crowned;
332,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"See the fair Matron in her summer bower,"
333,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Fresh as a rose in bright perennial flower;
334,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Read on her standard, always in the van,"
335,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"""TRUTH,""--the one word that makes a slave a man;"
336,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Think whose the hands that fed her altar-fires,"
337,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Then count the debt we owe our scholar-sires!
338,AN ACADEMIC POEM,
339,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Brothers, farewell! the fast declining ray"
340,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Fades to the twilight of our golden day;
341,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Some lesson yet our wearied brains may learn,"
342,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Some leaves, perhaps, in life's thin volume turn."
343,AN ACADEMIC POEM,How few they seem as in our waning age
344,AN ACADEMIC POEM,We count them backwards to the title-page!
345,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Oh let us trust with holy men of old
346,AN ACADEMIC POEM,Not all the story here begun is told;
347,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"So the tired spirit, waiting to be freed,"
348,AN ACADEMIC POEM,On life's last leaf with tranquil eye shall read
349,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"By the pale glimmer of the torch reversed,"
350,AN ACADEMIC POEM,"Not Finis, but _The End of Volume First_!"

357,MY AVIARY,
358,MY AVIARY,"Through my north window, in the wintry weather,--"
359,MY AVIARY,"My airy oriel on the river shore,--"
360,MY AVIARY,I watch the sea-fowl as they flock together
361,MY AVIARY,Where late the boatman flashed his dripping oar.
362,MY AVIARY,
363,MY AVIARY,"The gull, high floating, like a sloop unladen,"
364,MY AVIARY,Lets the loose water waft him as it will;
365,MY AVIARY,"The duck, round-breasted as a rustic maiden,"
366,MY AVIARY,"Paddles and plunges, busy, busy still."
367,MY AVIARY,
368,MY AVIARY,I see the solemn gulls in council sitting
369,MY AVIARY,"On some broad ice-floe pondering long and late,"
370,MY AVIARY,"While overhead the home-bound ducks are flitting,"
371,MY AVIARY,"And leave the tardy conclave in debate,"
372,MY AVIARY,
373,MY AVIARY,Those weighty questions in their breasts revolving
374,MY AVIARY,"Whose deeper meaning science never learns,"
375,MY AVIARY,"Till at some reverend elder's look dissolving,"
376,MY AVIARY,The speechless senate silently adjourns.
377,MY AVIARY,
378,MY AVIARY,But when along the waves the shrill north-easter
379,MY AVIARY,"Shrieks through the laboring coaster's shrouds ""Beware!"""
380,MY AVIARY,"The pale bird, kindling like a Christmas feaster"
381,MY AVIARY,"When some wild chorus shakes the vinous air,"
382,MY AVIARY,
383,MY AVIARY,"Flaps from the leaden wave in fierce rejoicing,"
384,MY AVIARY,"Feels heaven's dumb lightning thrill his torpid nerves,"
385,MY AVIARY,"Now on the blast his whistling plumage poising,"
386,MY AVIARY,"Now wheeling, whirling in fantastic curves."
387,MY AVIARY,
388,MY AVIARY,"Such is our gull; a gentleman of leisure,"
389,MY AVIARY,Less fleshed than feathered; bagged you'll find him such;
390,MY AVIARY,His virtue silence; his employment pleasure;
391,MY AVIARY,"Not bad to look at, and not good for much."
392,MY AVIARY,
393,MY AVIARY,"What of our duck? He has some high-bred cousins,--"
394,MY AVIARY,"His Grace the Canvas-back, My Lord the Brant,--"
395,MY AVIARY,"Anas and Anser,--both served up by dozens,"
396,MY AVIARY,"At Boston's Rocher, half-way to Nahant."
397,MY AVIARY,
398,MY AVIARY,"As for himself, he seems alert and thriving,--"
399,MY AVIARY,"Grubs up a living somehow--what, who knows?"
400,MY AVIARY,Crabs? mussels? weeds?--Look quick! there 's one just diving!
401,MY AVIARY,Flop! Splash! his white breast glistens--down he goes!
402,MY AVIARY,
403,MY AVIARY,And while he 's under--just about a minute--
404,MY AVIARY,I take advantage of the fact to say
405,MY AVIARY,His fishy carcase has no virtue in it
406,MY AVIARY,The gunning idiot's worthless hire to pay.
407,MY AVIARY,
408,MY AVIARY,Shrewd is our bird; not easy to outwit him!

1166,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"foundation of Phillips Academy, Andover."
1167,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1168,THE SCHOOL-BOY,1778-1878
1169,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1170,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"THESE hallowed precincts, long to memory dear,"
1171,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Smile with fresh welcome as our feet draw near;
1172,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With softer gales the opening leaves are fanned,"
1173,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With fairer hues the kindling flowers expand,"
1174,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The rose-bush reddens with the blush of June,"
1175,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The groves are vocal with their minstrels' tune,"
1176,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The mighty elm, beneath whose arching shade"
1177,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The wandering children of the forest strayed,"
1178,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Greets the bright morning in its bridal dress,"
1179,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And spreads its arms the gladsome dawn to bless.
1180,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is it an idle dream that nature shares
1181,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Our joys, our griefs, our pastimes, and our cares?"
1182,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Is there no summons when, at morning's call,"
1183,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The sable vestments of the darkness fall?
1184,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Does not meek evening's low-voiced Ave blend
1185,THE SCHOOL-BOY,With the soft vesper as its notes ascend?
1186,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is there no whisper in the perfumed air
1187,THE SCHOOL-BOY,When the sweet bosom of the rose is bare?
1188,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Does not the sunshine call us to rejoice?
1189,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Is there no meaning in the storm-cloud's voice?
1190,THE SCHOOL-BOY,No silent message when from midnight skies
1191,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Heaven looks upon us with its myriad eyes?
1192,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1193,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Or shift the mirror; say our dreams diffuse
1194,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"O'er life's pale landscape their celestial hues,"
1195,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Lend heaven the rainbow it has never known,"
1196,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And robe the earth in glories not its own,"
1197,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Sing their own music in the summer breeze,"
1198,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"With fresher foliage clothe the stately trees,"
1199,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Stain the June blossoms with a livelier dye
1200,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And spread a bluer azure on the sky,--"
1201,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Blest be the power that works its lawless will
1202,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And finds the weediest patch an Eden still;
1203,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"No walls so fair as those our fancies build,--"
1204,THE SCHOOL-BOY,No views so bright as those our visions gild!
1205,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1206,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So ran my lines, as pen and paper met,"
1207,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The truant goose-quill travelling like Planchette;
1208,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Too ready servant, whose deceitful ways"
1209,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Full many a slipshod line, alas! betrays;"
1210,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Hence of the rhyming thousand not a few
1211,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Have builded worse--a great deal--than they knew.
1212,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1213,THE SCHOOL-BOY,What need of idle fancy to adorn
1214,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Our mother's birthplace on her birthday morn?
1215,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Hers are the blossoms of eternal spring,"
1216,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From these green boughs her new-fledged birds take wing,"
1217,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"These echoes hear their earliest carols sung,"
1218,THE SCHOOL-BOY,In this old nest the brood is ever young.
1219,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"If some tired wanderer, resting from his flight,"
1220,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Amid the gay young choristers alight,"
1221,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"These gather round him, mark his faded plumes"
1222,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"That faintly still the far-off grove perfumes,"
1223,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And listen, wondering if some feeble note"
1224,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yet lingers, quavering in his weary throat:--"
1225,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"I, whose fresh voice yon red-faced temple knew,"
1226,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"What tune is left me, fit to sing to you?"
1227,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Ask not the grandeurs of a labored song,"
1228,THE SCHOOL-BOY,But let my easy couplets slide along;
1229,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Much could I tell you that you know too well;
1230,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Much I remember, but I will not tell;"
1231,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Age brings experience; graybeards oft are wise,"
1232,THE SCHOOL-BOY,But oh! how sharp a youngster's ears and eyes!
1233,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1234,THE SCHOOL-BOY,My cheek was bare of adolescent down
1235,THE SCHOOL-BOY,When first I sought the academic town;
1236,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Slow rolls the coach along the dusty road,"
1237,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Big with its filial and parental load;
1238,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The frequent hills, the lonely woods are past,"
1239,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The school-boy's chosen home is reached at last.
1240,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"I see it now, the same unchanging spot,"
1241,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The swinging gate, the little garden plot,"
1242,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The narrow yard, the rock that made its floor,"
1243,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The flat, pale house, the knocker-garnished door,"
1244,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The small, trim parlor, neat, decorous, chill,"
1245,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The strange, new faces, kind, but grave and still;"
1246,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Two, creased with age,--or what I then called age,--"
1247,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Life's volume open at its fiftieth page;
1248,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One, a shy maiden's, pallid, placid, sweet"
1249,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"As the first snow-drop, which the sunbeams greet;"
1250,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One, the last nursling's; slight she was, and fair,"
1251,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Her smooth white forehead warmed with auburn hair;
1252,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Last came the virgin Hymen long had spared,"
1253,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose daily cares the grateful household shared,"
1254,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Strong, patient, humble; her substantial frame"
1255,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Stretched the chaste draperies I forbear to name.
1256,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Brave, but with effort, had the school-boy come"
1257,THE SCHOOL-BOY,To the cold comfort of a stranger's home;
1258,THE SCHOOL-BOY,How like a dagger to my sinking heart
1259,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Came the dry summons, ""It is time to part;"
1260,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Good-by!"" ""Goo-ood-by!"" one fond maternal kiss. . . ."
1261,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Homesick as death! Was ever pang like this?
1262,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Too young as yet with willing feet to stray
1263,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From the tame fireside, glad to get away,--"
1264,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Too old to let my watery grief appear,--"
1265,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And what so bitter as a swallowed tear!
1266,THE SCHOOL-BOY,One figure still my vagrant thoughts pursue;
1267,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"First boy to greet me, Ariel, where are you?"
1268,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Imp of all mischief, heaven alone knows how"
1269,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"You learned it all,--are you an angel now,"
1270,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or tottering gently down the slope of years,"
1271,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Your face grown sober in the vale of tears?
1272,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Forgive my freedom if you are breathing still;
1273,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1274,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"If in a happier world, I know you will."
1275,THE SCHOOL-BOY,You were a school-boy--what beneath the sun
1276,THE SCHOOL-BOY,So like a monkey? I was also one.
1277,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Strange, sure enough, to see what curious shoots"
1278,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The nursery raises from the study's roots!
1279,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"In those old days the very, very good"
1280,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Took up more room--a little--than they should;
1281,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Something too much one's eyes encountered then
1282,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Of serious youth and funeral-visaged men;
1283,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The solemn elders saw life's mournful half,--"
1284,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Heaven sent this boy, whose mission was to laugh,"
1285,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Drollest of buffos, Nature's odd protest,"
1286,THE SCHOOL-BOY,A catbird squealing in a blackbird's nest.
1287,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Kind, faithful Nature! While the sour-eyed Scot--"
1288,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Her cheerful smiles forbidden or forgot--
1289,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Talks only of his preacher and his kirk,--"
1290,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Hears five-hour sermons for his Sunday work,--"
1291,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Praying and fasting till his meagre face
1292,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Gains its due length, the genuine sign of grace,--"
1293,THE SCHOOL-BOY,An Ayrshire mother in the land of Knox
1294,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Her embryo poet in his cradle rocks;--
1295,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Nature, long shivering in her dim eclipse,"
1296,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Steals in a sunbeam to those baby lips;
1297,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So to its home her banished smile returns,"
1298,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And Scotland sweetens with the song of Burns!
1299,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1300,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The morning came; I reached the classic hall;
1301,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A clock-face eyed me, staring from the wall;"
1302,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Beneath its hands a printed line I read
1303,THE SCHOOL-BOY,YOUTH IS LIFE'S SEED-TIME: so the clock-face said:
1304,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some took its counsel, as the sequel showed,--"
1305,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Sowed,--their wild oats,--and reaped as they had sowed."
1306,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"How all comes back! the upward slanting floor,--"
1307,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The masters' thrones that flank the central door,--"
1308,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The long, outstretching alleys that divide"
1309,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The rows of desks that stand on either side,--"
1310,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The staring boys, a face to every desk,"
1311,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Bright, dull, pale, blooming, common, picturesque."
1312,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Grave is the Master's look; his forehead wears
1313,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Thick rows of wrinkles, prints of worrying cares;"
1314,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Uneasy lie the heads of all that rule,"
1315,THE SCHOOL-BOY,His most of all whose kingdom is a school.
1316,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Supreme he sits; before the awful frown
1317,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That bends his brows the boldest eye goes down;
1318,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Not more submissive Israel heard and saw
1319,THE SCHOOL-BOY,At Sinai's foot the Giver of the Law.
1320,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Less stern he seems, who sits in equal Mate"
1321,THE SCHOOL-BOY,On the twin throne and shares the empire's weight;
1322,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Around his lips the subtle life that plays
1323,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Steals quaintly forth in many a jesting phrase;
1324,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A lightsome nature, not so hard to chafe,"
1325,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Pleasant when pleased; rough-handled, not so safe;"
1326,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some tingling memories vaguely I recall,"
1327,THE SCHOOL-BOY,But to forgive him. God forgive us all!
1328,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1329,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"One yet remains, whose well-remembered name"
1330,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Pleads in my grateful heart its tender claim;
1331,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"His was the charm magnetic, the bright look"
1332,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That sheds its sunshine on the dreariest book;
1333,THE SCHOOL-BOY,A loving soul to every task he brought
1334,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That sweetly mingled with the lore he taught;
1335,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Sprung from a saintly race that never could
1336,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"From youth to age be anything but good,"
1337,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"His few brief years in holiest labors spent,"
1338,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Earth lost too soon the treasure heaven had lent.
1339,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Kindest of teachers, studious to divine"
1340,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some hint of promise in my earliest line,"
1341,THE SCHOOL-BOY,These faint and faltering words thou canst not hear
1342,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Throb from a heart that holds thy memory dear.
1343,THE SCHOOL-BOY,As to the traveller's eye the varied plain
1344,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Shows through the window of the flying train,"
1345,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A mingled landscape, rather felt than seen,"
1346,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A gravelly bank, a sudden flash of green,"
1347,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A tangled wood, a glittering stream that flows"
1348,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Through the cleft summit where the cliff once rose,"
1349,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"All strangely blended in a hurried gleam,"
1350,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Rock, wood, waste, meadow, village, hill-side, stream,--"
1351,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So, as we look behind us, life appears,"
1352,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Seen through the vista of our bygone years.
1353,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yet in the dead past's shadow-filled domain,"
1354,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Some vanished shapes the hues of life retain;
1355,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Unbidden, oft, before our dreaming eyes"
1356,THE SCHOOL-BOY,From the vague mists in memory's path they rise.
1357,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So comes his blooming image to my view,"
1358,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The friend of joyous days when life was new,"
1359,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Hope yet untamed, the blood of youth unchilled,"
1360,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"No blank arrear of promise unfulfilled,"
1361,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Life's flower yet hidden in its sheltering fold,"
1362,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Its pictured canvas yet to be unrolled.
1363,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"His the frank smile I vainly look to greet,"
1364,THE SCHOOL-BOY,His the warm grasp my clasping hand should meet;
1365,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"How would our lips renew their school-boy talk,"
1366,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Our feet retrace the old familiar walk!
1367,THE SCHOOL-BOY,For thee no more earth's cheerful morning shines
1368,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Through the green fringes of the tented pines;
1369,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Ah me! is heaven so far thou canst not hear,"
1370,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or is thy viewless spirit hovering near,"
1371,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A fair young presence, bright with morning's glow,"
1372,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The fresh-cheeked boy of fifty years ago?
1373,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yes, fifty years, with all their circling suns,"
1374,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Behind them all my glance reverted runs;
1375,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where now that time remote, its griefs, its joys,"
1376,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where are its gray-haired men, its bright-haired boys?"
1377,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where is the patriarch time could hardly tire,--"
1378,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The good old, wrinkled, immemorial ""squire ""?"
1379,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"(An honest treasurer, like a black-plumed swan,"
1380,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Not every day our eyes may look upon.)
1381,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where the tough champion who, with Calvin's sword,"
1382,THE SCHOOL-BOY,In wordy conflicts battled for the Lord?
1383,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where the grave scholar, lonely, calm, austere,"
1384,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose voice like music charmed the listening ear,"
1385,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose light rekindled, like the morning star"
1386,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Still shines upon us through the gates ajar?
1387,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where the still, solemn, weary, sad-eyed man,"
1388,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose care-worn face and wandering eyes would scan,--"
1389,THE SCHOOL-BOY,His features wasted in the lingering strife
1390,THE SCHOOL-BOY,With the pale foe that drains the student's life?
1391,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where my old friend, the scholar, teacher, saint,"
1392,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Whose creed, some hinted, showed a speck of taint;"
1393,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"He broached his own opinion, which is not"
1394,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Lightly to be forgiven or forgot;
1395,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Some riddle's point,--I scarce remember now,--"
1396,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Homoi-, perhaps, where they said homo-ou."
1397,THE SCHOOL-BOY,(If the unlettered greatly wish to know
1398,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Where lies the difference betwixt oi and o,"
1399,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Those of the curious who have time may search
1400,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Among the stale conundrums of their church.)
1401,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Beneath his roof his peaceful life I shared,"
1402,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And for his modes of faith I little cared,--"
1403,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"I, taught to judge men's dogmas by their deeds,"
1404,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Long ere the days of india-rubber creeds.
1405,THE SCHOOL-BOY,
1406,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Why should we look one common faith to find,"
1407,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Where one in every score is color-blind?
1408,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"If here on earth they know not red from green,"
1409,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Will they see better into things unseen!
1410,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Once more to time's old graveyard I return
1411,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And scrape the moss from memory's pictured urn.
1412,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Who, in these days when all things go by steam,"
1413,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Recalls the stage-coach with its four-horse team?
1414,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Its sturdy driver,--who remembers him?"
1415,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or the old landlord, saturnine and grim,"
1416,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Who left our hill-top for a new abode
1417,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And reared his sign-post farther down the road?
1418,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Still in the waters of the dark Shawshine
1419,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Do the young bathers splash and think they're clean?
1420,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Do pilgrims find their way to Indian Ridge,"
1421,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Or journey onward to the far-off bridge,"
1422,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And bring to younger ears the story back
1423,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Of the broad stream, the mighty Merrimac?"
1424,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Are there still truant feet that stray beyond
1425,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"These circling bounds to Pomp's or Haggett's Pond,"
1426,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Or where the legendary name recalls
1427,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The forest's earlier tenant,--""Deerjump Falls""?"
1428,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Yes, every nook these youthful feet explore,"
1429,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Just as our sires and grand sires did of yore;
1430,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So all life's opening paths, where nature led"
1431,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Their father's feet, the children's children tread."
1432,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Roll the round century's fivescore years away,"
1433,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Call from our storied past that earliest day
1434,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"When great Eliphalet (I can see him now,--"
1435,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Big name, big frame, big voice, and beetling brow),"
1436,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Then young Eliphalet,--ruled the rows of boys"
1437,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"In homespun gray or old-world corduroys,--"
1438,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And save for fashion's whims, the benches show"
1439,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The self-same youths, the very boys we know."
1440,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Time works strange marvels: since I trod the green
1441,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And swung the gates, what wonders I have seen!"
1442,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"But come what will,--the sky itself may fall,--"
1443,THE SCHOOL-BOY,As things of course the boy accepts them all.
1444,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The prophet's chariot, drawn by steeds of flame,"
1445,THE SCHOOL-BOY,For daily use our travelling millions claim;
1446,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The face we love a sunbeam makes our own;
1447,THE SCHOOL-BOY,No more the surgeon hears the sufferer's groan;
1448,THE SCHOOL-BOY,What unwrit histories wrapped in darkness lay
1449,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Till shovelling Schliemann bared them to the day!
1450,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Your Richelieu says, and says it well, my lord,"
1451,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The pen is (sometimes) mightier than the sword;
1452,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Great is the goosequill, say we all; Amen!"
1453,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Sometimes the spade is mightier than the pen;
1454,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"It shows where Babel's terraced walls were raised,"
1455,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"The slabs that cracked when Nimrod's palace blazed,"
1456,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Unearths Mycenee, rediscovers Troy,--"
1457,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Calmly he listens, that immortal boy."
1458,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A new Prometheus tips our wands with fire,"
1459,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"A mightier Orpheus strains the whispering wire,"
1460,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Whose lightning thrills the lazy winds outrun
1461,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"And hold the hours as Joshua stayed the sun,--"
1462,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"So swift, in truth, we hardly find a place"
1463,THE SCHOOL-BOY,For those dim fictions known as time and space.
1464,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"Still a new miracle each year supplies,--"
1465,THE SCHOOL-BOY,"See at his work the chemist of the skies,"
1466,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Who questions Sirius in his tortured rays
1467,THE SCHOOL-BOY,And steals the secret of the solar blaze;
1468,THE SCHOOL-BOY,Hush! while the window-rattling bugles play
1469,THE SCHOOL-BOY,The nation's airs a hundred miles away!
1470,THE SCHOOL-BOY,That wicked phonograph! hark! how it swears!
