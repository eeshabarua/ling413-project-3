320,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,
321,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,As the mandate rang
322,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"The heavens through,"
323,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Quick the ray sprang:
324,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"Unheard it flew,"
325,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Sped by the touch of an unseen spur.
326,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,It crumbled the dusk of the deep
327,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"That folds the worlds in sleep,"
328,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,And shot through night with noiseless stir.
329,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,
330,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Then came the day;
331,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,And all that swift array
332,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Of diamond-sparkles died.
333,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,And lo! the far star cried:
334,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"""My light has lost its way!"""
335,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Ages on ages passed:

350,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"I passed and touched, on my round."
351,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Many a life undone
352,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,I lit with a tender gleam:
353,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"I shone in the lover's eyes,"
354,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,And soothed the maiden's dream.
355,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,But alas for the stifling mist of lies!
356,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"Alas, for the wrath of the battle-field"
357,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Where my glance was mixed with blood!
358,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,"And woe for the hearts by hate congealed,"
359,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,And the crime that rolls like a flood!
360,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Too vast is the world for me;
361,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Too vast for the sparkling dew
362,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Of a force like yours to renew.
363,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,Hopeless the world's immensity!
364,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,The suns go on without end:
365,THE STAR TO ITS LIGHT,The universe holds no friend:

408,JESSAMINE,"Here stands the great tree still, with broad bent head;"
409,JESSAMINE,"Its wide arms grown aweary, yet outspread"
410,JESSAMINE,With their old blessing. But wan memory weaves
411,JESSAMINE,"Strange garlands, now, amongst the darkening leaves."
412,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm_.
413,JESSAMINE,
414,JESSAMINE,Beneath these glimmering arches Jessamine
415,JESSAMINE,Walked with her lover long ago; and in
416,JESSAMINE,"The leaf-dimmed light he questioned, and she spoke;"
417,JESSAMINE,"Then on them both, supreme, love's radiance broke."
418,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm_.
419,JESSAMINE,
420,JESSAMINE,Sweet Jessamine we called her; for she shone
421,JESSAMINE,"Like blossoms that in sun and shade have grown,"
422,JESSAMINE,"Gathering from each alike a perfect white,"
423,JESSAMINE,Whose rich bloom breaks opaque through darkest night.
424,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm_.
425,JESSAMINE,
426,JESSAMINE,"For this her sweetness Walt, her lover, sought"
427,JESSAMINE,"To win her; wooed her here, his heart o'er fraught"
428,JESSAMINE,With fragrance of her being; and gained his plea.
429,JESSAMINE,"So ""We will wed,"" they said, ""beneath this tree."""
430,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
431,JESSAMINE,
432,JESSAMINE,Yet dreams of conquering greater prize for her
433,JESSAMINE,Roused his wild spirit with a glittering spur.
434,JESSAMINE,"Eager for wealth, far, far from home he sailed;"
435,JESSAMINE,"And life paused;--while she watched joy vanish, veiled."
436,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
437,JESSAMINE,
438,JESSAMINE,"Ah, better at the elm-tree's sunbrowned feet"
439,JESSAMINE,If he had been content to let life fleet
440,JESSAMINE,"Its wonted way!--lord of his little farm,"
441,JESSAMINE,In zest of joys or cares unmixed with harm.
442,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
443,JESSAMINE,
444,JESSAMINE,"For, as against a snarling sea one steers,"
445,JESSAMINE,He battled vainly with the surging years;
446,JESSAMINE,"While ever Jessamine must watch and pine,"
447,JESSAMINE,Her vision bounded by the bleak sea-line.
448,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
449,JESSAMINE,
450,JESSAMINE,Then silence fell; and all the neighbors said
451,JESSAMINE,"That Walt had married, faithless, or was dead:"
452,JESSAMINE,"Unmoved in constancy, her tryst she kept,"
453,JESSAMINE,"Each night beneath the tree, ere sorrow slept."
454,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
455,JESSAMINE,
456,JESSAMINE,"So, circling years went by, till in her face"
457,JESSAMINE,"Slow melancholy wrought a mingled grace,"
458,JESSAMINE,Of early joy with suffering's hard alloy--
459,JESSAMINE,"Refined and rare, no doom could e'er destroy."
460,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
461,JESSAMINE,
462,JESSAMINE,"Sometimes at twilight, when sweet Jessamine"
463,JESSAMINE,"Slow-footed, weary-eyed, passed by to win"
464,JESSAMINE,"The elm, we smiled for pity of her, and mused"
465,JESSAMINE,"On love that so could live, with love refused."
466,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._
467,JESSAMINE,
468,JESSAMINE,And none could hope for her. But she had grown
469,JESSAMINE,"Too high in love, for hope. She bloomed alone,"
470,JESSAMINE,Aloft in proud devotion; and secure
471,JESSAMINE,"Against despair; so sweet her faith, so sure."
472,JESSAMINE,_And the moon hangs low in the elm._

677,BRIDE BROOK,
678,BRIDE BROOK,"Received and ushered them, along."
679,BRIDE BROOK,"The very beasts before them fled,"

682,BRIDE BROOK,

684,BRIDE BROOK,Bore the maid's carrying-chair aloft;
685,BRIDE BROOK,"She swayed above, as roses nod"

687,BRIDE BROOK,
688,BRIDE BROOK,"At last beside the brook they stood,"
689,BRIDE BROOK,With Winthrop and his followers;
690,BRIDE BROOK,"The maid in flake-embroidered hood,"
691,BRIDE BROOK,"The magistrate well cloaked in furs,"
692,BRIDE BROOK,
693,BRIDE BROOK,"That, parting, showed a glimpse beneath"
694,BRIDE BROOK,"Of ample, throat-encircling ruff"

697,BRIDE BROOK,
698,BRIDE BROOK,"A few grave words, a question asked;"
699,BRIDE BROOK,Eyelids that with the answer fell
700,BRIDE BROOK,Like falling petals;--form that tasked
701,BRIDE BROOK,Brief time;--and so was wrought the spell!
702,BRIDE BROOK,
703,BRIDE BROOK,"Then ""Brooklet,"" Winthrop smiled and said,"
704,BRIDE BROOK,"""Frost's finger on thy lip makes dumb"
705,BRIDE BROOK,The voice wherewith thou shouldst have sped
706,BRIDE BROOK,"These lovers on their way. But, come,"
707,BRIDE BROOK,

712,BRIDE BROOK,
713,BRIDE BROOK,"Then laughed they all, and sudden beams"
714,BRIDE BROOK,Of sunshine quivered through the sky.
715,BRIDE BROOK,"Below the ice, the unheard stream's"
716,BRIDE BROOK,Clear heart thrilled on in ecstasy;
717,BRIDE BROOK,
718,BRIDE BROOK,"And lo, a visionary blush"
719,BRIDE BROOK,Stole warmly o'er the voiceless wild;
720,BRIDE BROOK,And in her rapt and wintry hush
721,BRIDE BROOK,The lonely face of Nature smiled.
722,BRIDE BROOK,
723,BRIDE BROOK,"Ah, Time, what wilt thou? Vanished quite"
724,BRIDE BROOK,Is all that tender vision now;
725,BRIDE BROOK,"And, like lost snow-flakes in the night,"
726,BRIDE BROOK,Mute are the lovers as their vow.
727,BRIDE BROOK,
728,BRIDE BROOK,"And O thou little, careless brook,"
729,BRIDE BROOK,Hast thou thy tender trust forgot?
730,BRIDE BROOK,"Her modest memory forsook,"
731,BRIDE BROOK,"Whose name, known once, thou utterest not?"
732,BRIDE BROOK,
733,BRIDE BROOK,Spring wakes the rill's blithe minstrelsy;
734,BRIDE BROOK,In willow bough or alder bush

736,BRIDE BROOK,Of pebbles 'neath the flood's clear gush;

802,THE SINGING WIRE,
803,THE SINGING WIRE,I listened to the branchless pole

807,THE SINGING WIRE,
808,THE SINGING WIRE,"""O wire more soft than seasoned lute,"

812,THE SINGING WIRE,
813,THE SINGING WIRE,"I listened, but it was in vain."
814,THE SINGING WIRE,"At first, the wind's old wayward will"
815,THE SINGING WIRE,"Drew forth the tearless, sad refrain."
816,THE SINGING WIRE,That ceased; and all was still.
817,THE SINGING WIRE,
818,THE SINGING WIRE,But suddenly some kindling shock
819,THE SINGING WIRE,"Struck flashing through the wire: a bird,"

902,THE LOVER'S YEAR,"The heart of Time, with purpose to relieve"

944,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,
945,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,
946,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Haunted by unknown feet--
947,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Ways of the midnight hour!
948,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Strangely you murmur below me,"
949,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Strange is your half-silent power.
950,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Places of life and of death,"
951,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Numbered and named as streets,"
952,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"What, through your channels of stone,"
953,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Is the tide that unweariedly beats?
954,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"A whisper, a sigh-laden breath,"
955,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Is all that I hear of its flowing.
956,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Footsteps of stranger and foe--
957,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Footsteps of friends, could we meet--"
958,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Alike to me in my sorrow;
959,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Alike to a life left alone.
960,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Yet swift as my heart they throb,"
961,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,They fall thick as tears on the stone:
962,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,My spirit perchance may borrow
963,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,New strength from their eager tone.
964,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,
965,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Still ever that slip and slide
966,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Of the feet that shuffle or glide,"
967,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,And linger or haste through the populous waste
968,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Of the shadowy, dim-lit square!"
969,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"And I know not, from the sound,"
970,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"As I sit and ponder within,"
971,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"The goal to which those steps are bound,--"
972,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"On hest of mercy, or hest of sin,"
973,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Or joy's short-measured round;
974,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Yet a meaning deep they bear
975,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,In their vaguely muffled din.
976,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,
977,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Roar of the multitude,"
978,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Chafe of the million-crowd,"
979,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,To this you are all subdued
980,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"In the murmurous, sad night-air!"
981,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Yet whether you thunder aloud,"
982,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Or hush your tone to a prayer,"
983,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,You chant amain through the modern maze
984,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,The only epic of our days.
985,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,
986,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Still as death are the places of life;
987,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"The city seems crumbled and gone,"
988,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Sunk 'mid invisible deeps--
989,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,The  city so lately rife
990,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,With the stir of brain and brawn.
991,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Haply it only sleeps;
992,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"But what if indeed it were dead,"
993,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,And another earth should arise
994,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,To greet the gray of the dawn?
995,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Faint then our epic would wail
996,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,To those who should come in our stead.
997,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,But what if that earth were ours?
998,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"What if, with holier eyes,"
999,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"We should meet the new hope, and not fail?"
1000,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,
1001,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Weary, the night grows pale:"
1002,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,With a blush as of opening flowers
1003,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Dimly the east shines red.
1004,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Can it be that the morn shall fulfil
1005,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"My dream, and refashion our clay"
1006,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,As the poet may fashion his rhyme?
1007,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Hark to that mingled scream
1008,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Rising from workshop and mill--
1009,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Hailing some marvelous sight;
1010,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Mighty breath of the hours,"
1011,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Poured through the trumpets of steam;
1012,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,"Awful tornado of time,"
1013,NIGHT IN NEW YORK,Blowing us whither it will!

1033,THE SONG-SPARROW,"It was there, perhaps, last year,"

1041,THE SONG-SPARROW,Held there by the sideward thrust

1060,THE SONG-SPARROW,
1061,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Oh, my sparrow, thou dost breed"
1062,THE SONG-SPARROW,Thought in me beyond all telling;

1064,THE SONG-SPARROW,"And fruitful blessing, with that welling"
1065,THE SONG-SPARROW,Ripple of ecstatic rest
1066,THE SONG-SPARROW,Gurgling ever from thy breast!

1069,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Vital motion in my blood,"
1070,THE SONG-SPARROW,"Such as in the sap-wood stirs,"
1071,THE SONG-SPARROW,Swells and shapes the pointed bud

1075,THE SONG-SPARROW,Yet I know not any charm

1287,V,Seemed but a smothered groan.
1288,V,Like sheeted wanderers from the grave
1289,V,"They moved, and yet seemed not to stir,"
1290,V,As icy gorge and sere-leaf'd grove
1291,V,Of withered oak and shrouded fir
1292,V,"Were passed, and onward still they strove;"
1293,V,While the loud wind's artillery clave

1302,VI,"And there the soldier sank, and died."
1303,VI,"Death-dumb he fell; yet ere life sped,"
1304,VI,Child-like on her knee he laid his head.
1305,VI,She strove to pray; but all words fled
1306,VI,Save those their love had sanctified.
1307,VI,
1308,VI,And then her voice rose waveringly
1309,VI,To the notes of a mother's lullaby;
1310,VI,"But her song was only ""Ah, must thou die?"""
1311,VI,And to her his eyes death-still replied.
1312,VI,

1315,VII,Dead leaves and stricken boughs

1319,VII,"But first, with solemn vows,"
1320,VII,"Took rifle, pouch, and horn,"
1321,VII,And the belt that he had worn.
1322,VII,"Then, onward pressing fast"
1323,VII,"Through the forest rude and vast,"
1324,VII,"Hunger-wasted, fever-parch'd,"
1325,VII,Many bitter days she marched
1326,VII,With bleeding feet that spurned the flinty pain;
1327,VII,One thought always throbbing through her brain:
1328,VII,"""They shall never say, 'He was afraid,'--"

1338,VIII,From cabin and rough settlement
1339,VIII,They come to speed her on her way--
1340,VIII,"Maidens, whose ruddy cheeks grow pale"
1341,VIII,With pity never felt before;
1342,VIII,Children that cluster at the door;
1343,VIII,"Mothers, whose toil-worn hands are lent"
1344,VIII,"To help, or bid her longer stay."
1345,VIII,"But through them all she passes on,"
1346,VIII,"Strangely martial, fair and wan;"
1347,VIII,Nor waits to listen to their cheers
1348,VIII,That sound so faintly in her ears.
1349,VIII,"For now all scenes around her shift,"
1350,VIII,Like those before a racer's eyes
1351,VIII,"When, foremost sped and madly swift,"
1352,VIII,"Quick stretching toward the goal he flies,"
1353,VIII,"Yet feels his strength wane with his breath,"
1354,VIII,"And purpose fail 'mid fears of death,--"
1355,VIII,
1356,VIII,"Till, like the flashing of a lamp,"
1357,VIII,"Starts forth the sight of Arnold's camp,--"
1358,VIII,"The bivouac flame, and sinuous gleam"
1359,VIII,"Of steel,--where, crouched, the army waits,"
1360,VIII,"Ere long, beyond the midnight stream,"
1361,VIII,To storm Quebec's ice-mounded gates.
1362,VIII,
1363,IX,IX
1364,IX,
1365,IX,"Then to the leader she was brought,"
1366,IX,And spoke her simply loyal thought.
1367,IX,"If, 'mid the shame of after-days,"
1368,IX,The man who wronged his country's trust
1369,IX,(Yet now in worth outweighed all praise)
1370,IX,"Remembered what this woman wrought,"
1371,IX,It should have bowed him to the dust!
1372,IX,"""Humbly my soldier-husband tried"
1373,IX,"To do his part. He served,--and died."
1374,IX,But honor did not die. His name
1375,IX,"And honor--bringing both, I came;"
1376,IX,"And this his rifle, here, to show,"
1377,IX,"While far away the tired heart sleeps,"
1378,IX,"To-day his faith with you he keeps!"""
1379,IX,
1380,IX,"Proudly the war bride, ending so,"
1381,IX,Sank breathless in the dumb white snow.

1388,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,A RUNE OF THE RAIN
1389,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,
1390,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,
1391,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,O many-toned rain!
1392,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,O myriad sweet voices of the rain!
1393,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,How welcome is its delicate overture
1394,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"At evening, when the moist and glowing west"
1395,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Seals all things with cool promise of night's rest.
1396,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,
1397,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,At first it would allure
1398,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"The earth to kinder mood,"
1399,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,With dainty flattering
1400,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Of soft, sweet pattering:"
1401,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Faintly now you hear the tramp
1402,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Of the fine drops, falling damp"
1403,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"On the dry, sun-seasoned ground"
1404,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"And the thirsty leaves, resound."
1405,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"But anon, imbued"
1406,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"With a sudden, bounding access"
1407,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Of passion, it relaxes"
1408,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,All timider persuasion.
1409,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"And, with nor pretext nor occasion,"
1410,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Its wooing redoubles;
1411,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"And pounds the ground, and bubbles"
1412,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"In sputtering spray,"
1413,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Flinging itself in a fury
1414,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Of flashing white away;
1415,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Till the dusty road,"
1416,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Dank-perfumed, is o'erflowed;"
1417,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"And the grass, and the wide-hung trees,"
1418,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"The vines, the flowers in their beds,--"
1419,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,The virid corn that to the breeze
1420,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Rustles along the garden-rows,--"
1421,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Visibly lift their heads,"
1422,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"And, as the quick shower wilder grows,"
1423,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Upleap with answering kisses to the rain.
1424,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,
1425,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Then, the slow and pleasant murmur"
1426,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Of its subsiding,"
1427,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"As the pulse of the storm beats firmer,"
1428,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,And the steady rain
1429,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Drops into a cadenced chiding!
1430,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Deep-breathing rain,"
1431,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,The sad and ghostly noise
1432,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Wherewith thou dost complain---
1433,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Thy plaintive, spiritual voice,"
1434,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Heard thus at close of day
1435,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Through vaults of twilight gray--
1436,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Vexes me with sweet pain;
1437,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,And still my soul is fain
1438,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,To know the secret of that yearning
1439,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Which in thine utterance I hear returning.
1440,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Hush, oh hush!"
1441,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Break not the dreamy rush
1442,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Of the rain:
1443,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Touch not the marring doubt
1444,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Words bring to the certainty
1445,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Of its soft refrain;
1446,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,But let the flying fringes flout
1447,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,"Their drops against the pane,"
1448,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,And the gurgling throat of the water-spout
1449,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Groan in the eaves amain.
1450,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,
1451,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,The earth is wedded to the shower;
1452,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,Darkness and awe gird round the bridal hour!
1453,A RUNE OF THE RAIN,
1454,II,II
1455,II,
1456,II,O many-toned rain!
1457,II,It hath caught the strain
1458,II,"Of a wilder tune,"
1459,II,"Ere the same night's noon,"
1460,II,"When dreams and sleep forsake me,"
1461,II,"And sudden dread doth wake me,"
1462,II,To hear the booming drums of heaven beat
1463,II,"The long roll to battle; when the knotted cloud,"
1464,II,"With an echoing loud,"
1465,II,Bursts asunder
1466,II,At the sudden resurrection of the thunder;
1467,II,"And the fountains of the air,"
1468,II,"Unsealed again, sweep, ruining, everywhere,"
1469,II,To wrap the world in a watery winding-sheet.
1470,II,
1471,III,III
1472,III,
1473,III,O myriad sweet voices of the rain!
1474,III,"When the airy war doth wane,"
1475,III,"And the storm to the east hath flown,"
1476,III,"Cloaked close in the whirling wind,"
1477,III,There's a voice still left behind
1478,III,"In each heavy-hearted tree,"
1479,III,Charged with tearful memory
1480,III,Of the vanished rain:
1481,III,From their leafy lashes wet
1482,III,Drip the dews of fresh regret
1483,III,For the lover that's gone!
1484,III,All else is still;
1485,III,"Yet the stars are listening,"
1486,III,And low o'er the wooded hill
1487,III,"Hangs, upon listless wing"
1488,III,"Outspread, a shape of damp, blue cloud,"
1489,III,"Watching, like a bird of evil"
1490,III,"That knows nor mercy nor reprieval,"
1491,III,The slow and silent death of the pallid moon.
1492,III,
1493,IV,IV
1494,IV,
1495,IV,"But soon, returning duly,"
1496,IV,Dawn whitens the wet hilltops bluely.
1497,IV,To her vision pure and cold
1498,IV,The night's wild tale is told
1499,IV,"On the glistening leaf, in the mid-road pool,"
1500,IV,"The garden mold turned dark and cool,"
1501,IV,And the meadows' trampled acres.
1502,IV,"But hark, how fresh the song of the winged music-makers!"
1503,IV,"For now the moanings bitter,"
1504,IV,"Left by the rain, make harmony"
1505,IV,"With the swallow's matin-twitter,"
1506,IV,"And the robin's note, like the wind's in a tree."
1507,IV,"The infant morning breathes sweet breath,"
1508,IV,And with it is blent
1509,IV,"The wistful, wild, moist scent"
1510,IV,Of the grass in the marsh which the sea nourisheth:
1511,IV,And behold!
1512,IV,"The last reluctant drop of the storm,"
1513,IV,"Wrung from the roof, is smitten warm"
1514,IV,And turned to gold;
1515,IV,For in its veins doth run
1516,IV,"The very blood of the bold, unsullied sun!"
1517,IV,
1518,IV,
1519,IV,
1520,IV,
1521,IV,
1522,IV,
1523,BREAKERS,BREAKERS
1524,BREAKERS,
1525,BREAKERS,
1526,BREAKERS,"Far out at sea there has been a storm,"
1527,BREAKERS,"And still, as they roll their liquid acres,"
1528,BREAKERS,High-heaped the billows lower and glisten.
1529,BREAKERS,"The air is laden, moist, and warm"
1530,BREAKERS,With the dying tempest's breath;
1531,BREAKERS,"And, as I walk the lonely strand"
1532,BREAKERS,"With sea-weed strewn, my forehead fanned"
1533,BREAKERS,"By wet salt-winds, I watch the breakers,"
1534,BREAKERS,"Furious sporting, tossed and tumbling,"
1535,BREAKERS,Shatter here with a dreadful rumbling--
1536,BREAKERS,"Watch, and muse, and vainly listen"
1537,BREAKERS,To the inarticulate mumbling
1538,BREAKERS,Of the hoary-headed deep;
1539,BREAKERS,"For who may tell me what it saith,"
1540,BREAKERS,"Muttering, moaning as in sleep?"
1541,BREAKERS,
1542,BREAKERS,Slowly and heavily
1543,BREAKERS,"Comes in the sea,"
1544,BREAKERS,"With memories of storm o'erfreighted,"
1545,BREAKERS,"With heaving heart and breath abated,"
1546,BREAKERS,"Pregnant with some mysterious, endless sorrow,"
1547,BREAKERS,"And seamed with many a gaping, sighing furrow."
1548,BREAKERS,
1549,BREAKERS,Slowly and heavily
1550,BREAKERS,Grows the green water-mound;
1551,BREAKERS,"But drawing ever nigher,"
1552,BREAKERS,"Towering ever higher,"
1553,BREAKERS,Swollen with an inward rage
1554,BREAKERS,"Naught but ruin can assuage,"
1555,BREAKERS,"Swift, now, without sound,"
1556,BREAKERS,Creeps stealthily
1557,BREAKERS,Up to the shore--
1558,BREAKERS,"Creeps, creeps and undulates;"
1559,BREAKERS,As one dissimulates
1560,BREAKERS,"Till, swayed by hateful frenzy,"
1561,BREAKERS,"Through passion grown immense, he"
1562,BREAKERS,Bursts forth hostilely;
1563,BREAKERS,"And rising, a smooth billow--"
1564,BREAKERS,"Its swelling, sunlit dome"
1565,BREAKERS,Thinned to a tumid ledge
1566,BREAKERS,"With keen, curved edge"
1567,BREAKERS,Like the scornful curl
1568,BREAKERS,Of lips that snarl--
1569,BREAKERS,O'ertops itself and breaks
1570,BREAKERS,Into a raving foam;
1571,BREAKERS,So springs upon the shore
1572,BREAKERS,With a hungry roar;
1573,BREAKERS,Its first fierce anger slakes
1574,BREAKERS,On the stony shallow;
1575,BREAKERS,"And runs up on the land,"
1576,BREAKERS,"Licking the smooth, hard sand,"
1577,BREAKERS,"Relentless, cold, yet wroth;"
1578,BREAKERS,And dies in savage froth.
1579,BREAKERS,
1580,BREAKERS,Then with its backward swirl
1581,BREAKERS,"The sands and the stones, how they whirl!"
1582,BREAKERS,"O, fiercely doth it draw"
1583,BREAKERS,"Them to its chasm'd maw,"
1584,BREAKERS,And against it in vain
1585,BREAKERS,They linger and strain;
1586,BREAKERS,And as they slip away
1587,BREAKERS,Into the seething gray
1588,BREAKERS,Fill all the thunderous air
1589,BREAKERS,"With the horror of their despair,"
1590,BREAKERS,And their wild terror wreak
1591,BREAKERS,"In one hoarse, wailing shriek."
1592,BREAKERS,
1593,BREAKERS,"But scarce is this done,"
1594,BREAKERS,When another one
1595,BREAKERS,"Falls like the bolt from a bellowing gun,"
1596,BREAKERS,And sucks away the shore
1597,BREAKERS,As that did before:
1598,BREAKERS,And another shall smother it o'er.
1599,BREAKERS,
1600,BREAKERS,Then there's a lull--a half-hush;
1601,BREAKERS,"And forward the little waves rush,"
1602,BREAKERS,"Toppling and hurrying,"
1603,BREAKERS,"Each other worrying,"
1604,BREAKERS,And in their haste
1605,BREAKERS,Run to waste.
1606,BREAKERS,
1607,BREAKERS,Yet again is heard the trample
1608,BREAKERS,Of the surges high and ample:
1609,BREAKERS,Their dreadful meeting--
1610,BREAKERS,The wild and sudden breaking--
1611,BREAKERS,"The dinting, and battering, and beating,"
1612,BREAKERS,And swift forsaking.
1613,BREAKERS,
1614,BREAKERS,"And ever they burst and boom,"
1615,BREAKERS,A numberless host;
1616,BREAKERS,Like heralds of doom
1617,BREAKERS,To the trembling coast;
1618,BREAKERS,And ever the tangled spray
1619,BREAKERS,"Is tossed from the fierce affray,"
1620,BREAKERS,"And, as with spectral arms"
1621,BREAKERS,"That taunt and beckon and mock,"
1622,BREAKERS,"And scatter vague alarms,"
1623,BREAKERS,Clasps and unclasps the rock;
1624,BREAKERS,Listlessly over it wanders;
1625,BREAKERS,"Moodily, madly maunders,"
1626,BREAKERS,And hissingly falls
1627,BREAKERS,From the glistening walls.
1628,BREAKERS,
1629,BREAKERS,So all day along the shore
1630,BREAKERS,"Shout the breakers, green and hoar,"
1631,BREAKERS,Weaving out their weird tune;
1632,BREAKERS,Till at night the full moon
1633,BREAKERS,Weds the dark with that ring
1634,BREAKERS,Of gold that you see her fling
1635,BREAKERS,On the misty air.
1636,BREAKERS,Then homeward slow returning
1637,BREAKERS,"To slumbers deep I fare,"
1638,BREAKERS,"Filled with an infinite yearning,"
1639,BREAKERS,With thoughts that rise and fall
1640,BREAKERS,"To the sound of the sea's hollow call,"
1641,BREAKERS,Breathed now from white-lit waves that reach
1642,BREAKERS,"Cold fingers o'er the damp, dark beach,"
1643,BREAKERS,To scatter a spray on my dreams;
1644,BREAKERS,Till the slow and measured rote
1645,BREAKERS,Brings a drowsy ease
1646,BREAKERS,"To my spirit, and seems"
1647,BREAKERS,To set it soothingly afloat
1648,BREAKERS,On broad and buoyant seas
1649,BREAKERS,"Of endless rest, lulled by the dirge"
1650,BREAKERS,Of the melancholy surge.
1651,BREAKERS,

1658,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1659,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","""Who is Blackmouth?"" Well, that's hard to say."
1660,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Mebbe he might ha' told you, 't other day,"
1661,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","If you'd been here. Now,--he's gone away."
1662,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Come to think on, 't wouldn't ha' been no use"
1663,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",If you'd called here earlier. His excuse
1664,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Always was, whenever folks would ask him"
1665,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Where he hailed from, an' _would_ tease an' task him;--"
1666,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","What d' you s'pose? He just said, ""I don' know."""
1667,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1668,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",That was truth. He came here long ago;
1669,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","But, before that, he'd been born somewhere:"
1670,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","The conundrum started first, right there."
1671,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Little shaver--afore he knew his name
1672,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Or the place from whereabouts he came--
1673,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",On a wagon-train the Apaches caught him.
1674,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Killed the old folks! But this cus'--they brought him
1675,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Safe away from fire an' knife an' arrows.
1676,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",So'thin' 'bout him must have touched their marrows:
1677,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",They was merciful;--treated him real good;
1678,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Brought him up to man's age well's they could.
1679,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Now, d' you b'lieve me, that there likely lad,"
1680,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","For all they used him so, went to the bad:"
1681,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Leastways left the red men, that he knew,"
1682,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",'N' come to look for folks like me an' you;--
1683,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Goldarned white folks that he never saw.
1684,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Queerest thing was--though he loved a squaw,"
1685,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",'T was on her account he planned escape;
1686,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Shook the Apaches, an' took up red tape"
1687,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",With the U. S. gov'ment arter a while;
1688,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Tho' they do say gov'ment may be vile,"
1689,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Mean an' treacherous an' deceivin'. Well,"
1690,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",_I_ ain't sayin' our gov'ment is a sell.
1691,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1692,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Bocanegra--Spanish term--I've heard
1693,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Stands for ""Blackmouth."" Now this curious bird,"
1694,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Known as Bocanegra, gave his life"
1695,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Most for others. First, he saved his wife;"
1696,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Her I spoke of;--nothin' but a squaw.
1697,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",You might wonder by what sort of law
1698,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","He, a white man born, should come to love her."
1699,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",But 't was somehow so: he _did_ discover
1700,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Beauty in her, of the holding kind."
1701,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Some men love the light, an' some the shade."
1702,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Round that little Indian girl there played
1703,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Soft an' shadowy tremblings, like the dark"
1704,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Under trees; yet now an' then a spark,"
1705,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Quick 's a firefly, flashing from her eyes,"
1706,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Made you think of summer-midnight skies.
1707,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","She was faithful, too, like midnight stars."
1708,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","As for Blackmouth, if you'd seen the scars"
1709,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Made by wounds he suffered for her sake,"
1710,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","You'd have called _him_ true, and no mistake."
1711,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1712,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Growin' up a man, he scarcely met"
1713,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Other white folks; an' his heart was set
1714,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","On this red girl. Yet he said: ""We'll wait."
1715,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",You must never be my wedded mate
1716,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Till we reach the white man's country. There,"
1717,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Everything that's done is fair and square."""
1718,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Patiently they stayed, thro' trust or doubt,"
1719,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Till tow'rds Colorado he could scout
1720,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Some safe track. He told her: ""You go first."
1721,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",All my joy goes with you:--that's the worst!
1722,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","But _I_ wait, to guard or hide the trail."""
1723,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1724,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Indians caught him; an' they gave him--hail;
1725,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Cut an' tortured him, till he was bleeding;"
1726,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Yet they found that still they weren't succeeding.
1727,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","""Where's that squaw?"" they asked. ""We'll have her blood!"
1728,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Either that, or grind you into mud;"
1729,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Pick your eyes out, too, if you can't see"
1730,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Where she's gone to. Which, now, shall it be?"
1731,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Tell us where she's hid."""
1732,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1733,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","""I'll show the way,"""
1734,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Blackmouth says; an' leads toward dawn of day,"
1735,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Till they come straight out beside the brink
1736,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Of a precipice that seems to sink
1737,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Into everlasting gulfs below.
1738,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","""Loose me!"" Blackmouth tells 'em. ""But go slow."""
1739,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Then they loosed him; and, with one swift leap,"
1740,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Blackmouth swooped right down into the deep;--
1741,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Jumped out into space beyond the edge,"
1742,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",While the Apaches cowered along the ledge.
1743,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Seven hundred feet, they say. That's guff!"
1744,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Seventy foot, I tell you, 's 'bout enough."
1745,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Indians called him a dead antelope;
1746,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",But they couldn't touch the bramble-slope
1747,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Where he, bruised and stabbed, crawled under brush."
1748,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",_Their_ hand was beat hollow: _he_ held a flush.
1749,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1750,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Day and night he limped or crawled along:
1751,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Winds blew hot, yet sang to him a song"
1752,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","(So he told me, once) that gave him hope."
1753,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Every time he saw a shadow grope
1754,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Down the hillsides, from a flying cloud,"
1755,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Something touched his heart that made him proud:
1756,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Seemed to him he saw her dusky face
1757,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Watching over him, from place to place."
1758,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Every time the dry leaves rustled near,"
1759,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","Seemed to him she whispered, ""Have no fear!"""
1760,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",
1761,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",So at last he found her:--they were married.
1762,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO","But, from those days on, he always carried"
1763,"BLACKMOUTH, OF COLORADO",Marks of madness; actually--yes!--

2646,NINTH OPAL,One venturous day Love came;
2647,NINTH OPAL,Found us; and bound with a link

3123,A STRONG CITY,"That smote the air with blackness, and devoured"

3125,A STRONG CITY,Till it grew livid with a sudden age--
3126,A STRONG CITY,The death of hope.
3127,A STRONG CITY,
3128,A STRONG CITY,O squandered happiness;
3129,A STRONG CITY,Vain dust of misery powdering life's fresh flower!
3130,A STRONG CITY,"The sky was holy, but the earth was not."
3131,A STRONG CITY,
3132,A STRONG CITY,"Men ruled, but ruled in vain; since wretchedness"
3133,A STRONG CITY,"Of soul and body, for the mass of men,"
3134,A STRONG CITY,Made them like dead leaves in an idle drift
3135,A STRONG CITY,Around the plough of progress as it drove
3136,A STRONG CITY,"Sharp through the glebe of modern days, to plant"
3137,A STRONG CITY,A civilized world. Ay; civilized--but not Christian!
3138,A STRONG CITY,
3139,A STRONG CITY,Civilization is a clarion voice
3140,A STRONG CITY,Crying in the wilderness; a prophet-word

3142,A STRONG CITY,"Crowded with nations, there arose a strife;"
3143,A STRONG CITY,Disturbance of men; tongues contradicting tongues;
3144,A STRONG CITY,"Madness of noise, that scattered multitudes;"

3147,A STRONG CITY,"Howled ""Progress! Change!""--as though all moods of change"
3148,A STRONG CITY,Were fiats of truth eternal.
3149,A STRONG CITY,
3150,A STRONG CITY,'Mid the din
3151,A STRONG CITY,"Two pilgrims, faring forward, saw the light"
3152,A STRONG CITY,"In a strong city, fortified, and moved"

3154,A STRONG CITY,"Cried scoffers. ""There is mercy in the world;"
3155,A STRONG CITY,But chiefly mercy of man to man. For we

3157,A STRONG CITY,Our charity is enormous. Look at these
3158,A STRONG CITY,Long rolls of rich subscriptions. We are good.
3159,A STRONG CITY,"'T is true, God's mercy plays a part in things;"
3160,A STRONG CITY,But most is left to us; and we judge well.
3161,A STRONG CITY,Stay with us in the field of endless war!
3162,A STRONG CITY,Here only is health. Yon city fortified
3163,A STRONG CITY,"You dream of--why, its ramparts are as dust."
3164,A STRONG CITY,It gives no safety. One assaulting sweep
3165,A STRONG CITY,Of our huge cohorts would annul its power--
3166,A STRONG CITY,"Crush it in atoms; make it meaningless."""
3167,A STRONG CITY,
3168,A STRONG CITY,The pilgrims listened; but onward still they moved.
3169,A STRONG CITY,They passed the gates; they stood upon a hill
3170,A STRONG CITY,"Enclosed, but in that strong enclosure free!"
3171,A STRONG CITY,"Though earth opposed, they held the key to heaven."
3172,A STRONG CITY,"On came the turbulent multitude in war,"
3173,A STRONG CITY,Dashing against the city's walls; and swept
3174,A STRONG CITY,"Through all the streets, and robbed and burned and killed."
3175,A STRONG CITY,The walls were strong; the gates were always open.
3176,A STRONG CITY,"And so the invader rioted, and was proud."
3177,A STRONG CITY,"But sudden, in seeming triumph, the enemy host"
3178,A STRONG CITY,Was stricken with death; and still the city stayed.
3179,A STRONG CITY,"Skyward the souls of its defenders rose,"
3180,A STRONG CITY,Returning soon in mist intangible
3181,A STRONG CITY,That flashed with radiance of half-hidden swords;
3182,A STRONG CITY,And those who still assaulted--though they crept
3183,A STRONG CITY,"Into the inmost vantage-points, with craft--"
3184,A STRONG CITY,"Fell, blasted namelessly by this veiled flash,"
3185,A STRONG CITY,"Even as they shouted out, ""The place is ours!"""
3186,A STRONG CITY,
3187,A STRONG CITY,"So those two pilgrims dwelt there, fortified"
3188,A STRONG CITY,In that strong city men had thought so frail.
3189,A STRONG CITY,"They died, and lived again. Fiercest attack"
3190,A STRONG CITY,"Was as a perfumed breeze to them, which drew"
3191,A STRONG CITY,Their souls still closer unto God. And there
3192,A STRONG CITY,Beauty and splendor bloomed untouched. The stars
3193,A STRONG CITY,"Spoke to them, bidding them be of good cheer,"
3194,A STRONG CITY,Though hostile hordes rushed over them in blood.
3195,A STRONG CITY,And still the prayers of all that people rose
3196,A STRONG CITY,As incense mingled with music of their hearts.
3197,A STRONG CITY,For Christ was with them: angels were their aid.
3198,A STRONG CITY,What though the enemy used their open gates?
3199,A STRONG CITY,The children of the citadel conquered all
3200,A STRONG CITY,"Their conquerors, smiting them with the pure light"

3876,MARTHY VIRGINIA'S HAND,"Long ago ended the struggle, in union of"

3891,I,I
3892,I,
3893,I,"Victors, living, with laureled brow,"
3894,I,And you that sleep beneath the sward!
3895,I,Your song was poured from cannon throats:
3896,I,It rang in deep-tongued bugle-notes:
3897,I,"Your triumph came; you won your crown,"
3898,I,The grandeur of a world's renown.
3899,I,"But, in our later lays,"
3900,I,"Full freighted with your praise,"
3901,I,"Fair memory harbors those whose lives, laid down"
3902,I,"In gallant faith and generous heat,"
3903,I,Gained only sharp defeat.
3904,I,"All are at peace, who once so fiercely warred:"

3908,II,II
3909,II,
3910,II,"For, if we say God wills,"
3911,II,Shall we then idly deny Him
3912,II,Care of each host in the fight?
3913,II,His thunder was here in the hills
3914,II,When the guns were loud in July;
3915,II,And the flash of the musketry's light
3916,II,Was sped by a ray from God's eye.
3917,II,In its good and its evil the scheme
3918,II,"Was framed with omnipotent hand,"
3919,II,Though the battle of men was a dream
3920,II,That they could but half understand.
3921,II,Can the purpose of God pass by him?
3922,II,"Nay; it was sure, and was wrought"
3923,II,Under inscrutable powers:
3924,II,Bravely the two armies fought
3925,II,"And left the land, that was greater than they, still theirs and ours!"
3926,II,
3927,II,
3928,III,III
3929,III,
3930,III,"Lucid, pure, and calm and blameless"
3931,III,Dawned on Gettysburg the day
3932,III,"That should make the spot, once fameless,"
3933,III,Known to nations far away.
3934,III,"Birds were caroling, and farmers"
3935,III,"Gladdened o'er their garnered hay,"
3936,III,When the clank of gathering armors
3937,III,Broke the morning's peaceful sway;
3938,III,And the living lines of foemen
3939,III,"Drawn o'er pasture, brook, and hill,"
3940,III,Formed in figures weird of omen
3941,III,That should work with mystic will
3942,III,Measures of a direful magic--
3943,III,"Shattering, maiming--and should fill"
3944,III,Glades and gorges with a tragic
3945,III,Madness of desire to kill.
3946,III,Skirmishers flung lightly forward
3947,III,Moved like scythemen skilled to sweep
3948,III,"Westward o'er the field and nor'ward,"
3949,III,Death's first harvest there to reap.
3950,III,"You would say the soft, white smoke-puffs"
3951,III,"Were but languid clouds asleep,"
3952,III,"Here on meadows, there on oak-bluffs,"
3953,III,Fallen foam of Heaven's blue deep.
3954,III,Yet that blossom-white outbreaking
3955,III,Smoke wove soon a martyr's shroud.
3956,III,"Reynolds fell, with soul unquaking,"
3957,III,Ardent-eyed and open-browed:
3958,III,Noble men in humbler raiment
3959,III,"Fell where shot their graves had plowed,"
3960,III,Dying not for paltry payment:
3961,III,"Proud of home, of honor proud."

3964,IV,IV
3965,IV,
3966,IV,"Mute Seminary there,"
3967,IV,"Filled once with resonant hymn and prayer,"
3968,IV,How your meek walls and windows shuddered then!
3969,IV,"Though Doubleday stemmed the flood,"
3970,IV,McPherson's Wood and Willoughby's Run
3971,IV,Saw ere the set of sun
3972,IV,The light of the gospel of blood.
3973,IV,"And, on the morrow again,"
3974,IV,Loud the unholy psalm of battle
3975,IV,"Burst from the tortured Devil's Den,"
3976,IV,In cries of men and musketry rattle
3977,IV,Mixed with the helpless bellow of cattle
3978,IV,"Torn by artillery, down in the glen;"
3979,IV,"While, hurtling through the branches"
3980,IV,"Of the orchard by the road,"
3981,IV,"Where Sickles and Birney were walled with steel,"
3982,IV,Shot fiery avalanches
3983,IV,That shivered hope and made the sturdiest reel.
3984,IV,Yet peach-bloom bright as April saw
3985,IV,"Blushed there anew, in blood that flowed"
3986,IV,O'er faces white with death-dealt awe;
3987,IV,"And ruddy flowers of warfare grew,"
3988,IV,"Though withering winds as of the desert blew,"
3989,IV,"Far at the right while Ewell and Early,"
3990,IV,"Plunging at Slocum and Wadsworth and Greene,"
3991,IV,Thundered in onslaught consummate and surly;
3992,IV,Till trembling nightfall crept between
3993,IV,And whispered of rest from the heat of the whelming strife.
3994,IV,But unto those forsaken of life
3995,IV,What has the night to say?
3996,IV,"Silent beneath the moony sky,"
3997,IV,Crushed in a costly dew they lie:
3998,IV,"Deaf to plaint or paean, they:--"
3999,IV,Freed from Earth's dull tyranny.
4000,IV,
4001,IV,
4002,V,V
4003,V,
4004,V,"Wordless the night-wind, funereal plumes of the tree-tops swaying--"
4005,V,Writhing and nodding anon at the beck of the unseen breeze!
4006,V,"Yet its voice ever a murmur resumes, as of multitudes praying:"
4007,V,Liturgies lost in a moan like the mourning of far-away seas.
4008,V,"May then those spirits, set free, a celestial council obeying,"
4009,V,"Move in this rustling whisper here thro' the dark, shaken trees?--"
4010,V,"Souls that are voices alone to us, now, yet linger, returning"
4011,V,Thrilled with a sweet reconcilement and fervid with speechless desire?
4012,V,"Sundered in warfare, immortal they meet now with wonder and yearning,"
4013,V,"Dwelling together united, a rapt, invisible choir:"
4014,V,"Hearken! They wail for the living, whose passion of battle, yet burning,"
4015,V,"Sears and enfolds them in coils, and consumes, like a serpent of fire!"
4016,V,
4017,V,
4018,VI,VI
4019,VI,
4020,VI,"Men of New Hampshire, Pennsylvanians,"
4021,VI,"Maine men, firm as the rock's rough ledge!"
4022,VI,"Swift Mississippians, lithe Carolinians"
4023,VI,Bursting over the battle's edge!
4024,VI,Bold Indiana men; gallant Virginians;
4025,VI,Jersey and Georgia legions clashing;--
4026,VI,Pick of Connecticut; quick Vermonters;
4027,VI,"Louisianians, madly dashing;--"
4028,VI,"And, swooping still to fresh encounters,"
4029,VI,"New-York myriads, whirlwind-led!--"
4030,VI,"All your furious forces, meeting,"
4031,VI,"Torn, entangled, and shifting place,"
4032,VI,Blend like wings of eagles beating
4033,VI,"Airy abysses, in angry embrace."
4034,VI,Here in the midmost struggle combining--
4035,VI,Flags immingled and weapons crossed--
4036,VI,Still in union your States troop shining:
4037,VI,Never a star from the lustre is lost!
4038,VI,
4039,VI,
4040,VII,VII
4041,VII,
4042,VII,Once more the sun deploys his rays:
4043,VII,Third in the trilogy of battle-days
4044,VII,The awful Friday comes:
4045,VII,"A day of dread,"
4046,VII,"That should have moved with slow, averted head"
4047,VII,"And muffled feet,"
4048,VII,"Knowing what streams of pure blood shed,"
4049,VII,What broken hearts and wounded lives must meet
4050,VII,Its pitiless tread.
4051,VII,"At dawn, like monster mastiffs baying,"
4052,VII,"Federal cannon, with a din affraying,"
4053,VII,"Roused the old Stonewall brigade,"
4054,VII,"That, eagerly and undismayed,"
4055,VII,"Charged amain, to be repelled"
4056,VII,"After four hours' bitter fighting,"
4057,VII,"Forth and back, with bayonets biting;"
4058,VII,"Where in after years, the wood--"
4059,VII,Flayed and bullet-riddled--stood
4060,VII,"A presence ghostly, grim and stark,"
4061,VII,"With trees all withered, wasted, gray,"
4062,VII,The place of combat night and day
4063,VII,Like marshaled skeletons to mark.
4064,VII,"Anon, a lull: the troops are spelled."
4065,VII,No sound of guns or drums
4066,VII,Disturbs the air.
4067,VII,"Only the insect-chorus faintly hums,"
4068,VII,"Chirping around the patient, sleepless dead"
4069,VII,"Scattered, or fallen in heaps all wildly spread;"
4070,VII,Forgotten fragments left in hurried flight;
4071,VII,"Forms that, a few hours since, were human creatures,"
4072,VII,"Now blasted of their features,"
4073,VII,Or stamped with blank despair;
4074,VII,"Or with dumb faces smiling as for gladness,"
4075,VII,Though stricken by utter blight
4076,VII,"Of motionless, inert, and hopeless sadness."
4077,VII,Fear you the naked horrors of a war?
4078,VII,"Then cherish peace, and take up arms no more."
4079,VII,"For, if you fight, you must"
4080,VII,Behold your brothers' dust
4081,VII,Unpityingly ground down
4082,VII,"And mixed with blood and powder,"
4083,VII,To write the annals of renown
4084,VII,That make a nation prouder!
4085,VII,
4086,VII,
4087,VIII,VIII
4088,VIII,
4089,VIII,All is quiet till one o'clock;
4090,VIII,"Then the hundred and fifty guns,"
4091,VIII,"Metal loaded with metal in tons,"
4092,VIII,"Massed by Lee, send out their shock."
4093,VIII,"And, with a movement magnificent,"
4094,VIII,"Pickett, the golden-haired leader,"
4095,VIII,"Thousands and thousands flings onward, as if he sent"
4096,VIII,Merely a meek interceder.
4097,VIII,"Steadily sure his division advances,"
4098,VIII,Gay as the light on its weapons that dances.
4099,VIII,Agonized screams of the shell
4100,VIII,The doom that it carries foretell:
4101,VIII,"Rifle-balls whistle, like sea-birds singing;"
4102,VIII,"Limbs are severed, and souls set winging;"
4103,VIII,Yet Pickett's warriors never waver.
4104,VIII,Show me in all the world anything braver
4105,VIII,"Than the bold sweep of his fearless battalions,"
4106,VIII,Three half-miles over ground unsheltered
4107,VIII,"Up to the cannon, where regiments weltered"
4108,VIII,Prone in the batteries' blast that raked
4109,VIII,"Swaths of men and, flame-tongued, drank"
4110,VIII,Their blood with eager thirst unslaked.
4111,VIII,"Armistead, Kemper, and Pettigrew"
4112,VIII,"Rush on the Union men, rank against rank,"
4113,VIII,Planting their battle-flags high on the crest.
4114,VIII,"Pause not the soldiers, nor dream they of rest,"
4115,VIII,Till they fall with their enemy's guns at the breast
4116,VIII,And the shriek in their ears of the wounded artillery stallions.
4117,VIII,"So Pickett charged, a man indued"
4118,VIII,With knightly power to lead a multitude
4119,VIII,And bring to fame the scarred surviving few.

4122,IX,IX
4123,IX,
4124,IX,In vain the mighty endeavor;
4125,IX,In vain the immortal valor;
4126,IX,In vain the insurgent life outpoured!
4127,IX,"Faltered the column, spent with shot and sword;"
4128,IX,Its bright hope blanched with sudden pallor;
4129,IX,While Hancock's trefoil bloomed in triple fame.
4130,IX,He chose the field; he saved the second day;
4131,IX,"And, honoring here his glorious name,"
4132,IX,Again his phalanx held victorious sway.
4133,IX,"Meade's line stood firm, and volley on volley roared"
4134,IX,"Triumphant Union, soon to be restored,"
4135,IX,Strong to defy all foes and fears forever.
4136,IX,The Ridge was wreathed with angry fire
4137,IX,As flames rise round a martyr's stake;
4138,IX,For many a hero on that pyre
4139,IX,"Was offered for our dear land's sake,"
4140,IX,What time in heaven the gray clouds flew
4141,IX,To mingle with the deathless blue;
4142,IX,"While here, below, the blue and gray"
4143,IX,"Melted minglingly away,"
4144,IX,"Mirroring heaven, to make another day."
4145,IX,"And we, who are Americans, we pray"
4146,IX,The splendor of strength that Gettysburg knew
4147,IX,"May light the long generations with glorious ray,"
4148,IX,And keep us undyingly true!

4154,X,Dear are the strong hearts broken!
4155,X,Proudly their memory we keep for
4156,X,Our help and hope; a token
4157,X,Of sacred thought too deep for
4158,X,Words that leave it unspoken.
4159,X,"All that we know of fairest,"
4160,X,"All that we have of meetest,"
4161,X,Here we lay down for the rarest
4162,X,Doers whose souls rose fleetest
4163,X,"And in their homes of air rest,"
4164,X,Ranked with the truest and sweetest.
4165,X,"Days, with fiery-hearted, bold advances;"
4166,X,"Nights in dim and shadowy, swift retreat;"
4167,X,"Rains that rush with bright, embattled lances;"
4168,X,"Thunder, booming round your stirless feet;--"
4169,X,Winds that set the orchard with sweet fancies
4170,X,"All abloom, or ripple the ripening wheat;"
4171,X,"Moonlight, starlight, on your mute graves falling;"
4172,X,"Dew, distilled as tears unbidden flow;--"
4173,X,Dust of drought in drifts and layers crawling;
4174,X,Lulling dreams of softly whispering snow;
4175,X,"Happy birds, from leafy coverts calling;--"
4176,X,"These go on, yet none of these you know:"
4177,X,Hearing not our human voices
4178,X,"Speaking to you all in vain,"
4179,X,"Nor the psalm of a land that rejoices,"
4180,X,Ringing from churches and cities and foundries a mighty refrain!
4181,X,"But we, and the sun and the birds, and the breezes that blow"
4182,X,"When tempests are striving and lightnings of heaven are spent,"
4183,X,With one consent
4184,X,Make unto them
4185,X,Who died for us eternal requiem.

4193,XI,Our hearts go out to you as toward a bride!
4194,XI,"Garmented soft in white,"
4195,XI,"Haughty, and yet how love-imbuing and tender!"
4196,XI,You stand before us with your gently mournful
4197,XI,"Memory-haunted eyes and flower-like mouth,"
4198,XI,Where clinging thoughts--as bees a-cluster
4199,XI,"Murmur through the leafy gloom,"
4200,XI,Musical in monotone--
4201,XI,Whisper sadly. Yet a lustre
4202,XI,As of glowing gold-gray light
4203,XI,"Shines upon the orient bloom,"
4204,XI,"Sweet with orange-blossoms, thrown"
4205,XI,"Round the jasmine-starred, deep night"
4206,XI,Crowning with dark hair your brow.
4207,XI,"Ruthless, once, we came to slay,"
4208,XI,And you met us then with hate.
4209,XI,"Rough was the wooing of war: we won you,"
4210,XI,"Won you at last, though late!"
4211,XI,"Dear South, to-day,"
4212,XI,As our country's altar made us
4213,XI,"One forever, so we vow"
4214,XI,Unto yours our love to render:
4215,XI,"Strength with strength we here endow,"
4216,XI,And we make your honor ours.
4217,XI,Happiness and hope shall sun you:
4218,XI,All the wiles that half betrayed us

4232,XII,Our hearts together!

4254,NOTES,[1] _Bride Brook_.--The colony of New London (now part of
4255,NOTES,"Connecticut) was founded by John Winthrop, Jr., under the jurisdiction"
4256,NOTES,of Massachusetts. One of the boundary lines was a stream flowing into
4257,NOTES,"Long Island Sound, between the present city of New London and the"
4258,NOTES,"Connecticut River. In the snowy winter of 1646, Jonathan Rudd, who dwelt"
4259,NOTES,"in the settlement of Saybrook Fort, at the mouth of the Connecticut,"
4260,NOTES,sent for Winthrop to celebrate a marriage between himself and a certain
4261,NOTES,"""Mary"" of Saybrook, whose last name has been lost. Winthrop performed"
4262,NOTES,"the ceremony on the frozen surface of the streamlet, the farthest limit"
4263,NOTES,"of his magistracy; and thereupon bestowed the name ""Bride Brook,"" which"

4269,NOTES,"equipments and herself carried them to Quebec, where she delivered them"

4276,NOTES,"triumphed in his assault on Quebec. It is a curious circumstance that,"
4277,NOTES,"with this traitor at the rear, and with Benedict Arnold at its head, the"
