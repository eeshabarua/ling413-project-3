151,PART I.,
152,PART I.,_He waits musing._
153,PART I.,
154,PART I.,Herein the dearness of her is:
155,PART I.,The thirty perfect days of June
156,PART I.,"Made one, in beauty and in bliss"
157,PART I.,"Were not more white to have to kiss,"
158,PART I.,To love not more in tune.
159,PART I.,
160,PART I.,"And oft I think she is too true,"
161,PART I.,Too innocent for our day;
162,PART I.,For in her eyes her soul looks new--
163,PART I.,Two crowfoot-blossoms watchet-blue
164,PART I.,Are not more soft than they.
165,PART I.,
166,PART I.,"So good, so kind is she to me,"
167,PART I.,"In darling ways and happy words,"
168,PART I.,Sometimes my heart fears she may be
169,PART I.,Too much with God and secretly
170,PART I.,Sweet sister to the birds.
171,PART I.,
172,PART I.,
173,PART I.,2.
174,PART I.,
175,PART I.,_Becoming impatient._
176,PART I.,
177,PART I.,"The owls are quavering, two, now three,"
178,PART I.,And all the green is graying;
179,PART I.,The owls our trysting dials be--
180,PART I.,There is no time for staying.
181,PART I.,
182,PART I.,I wait you where this buckeye throws
183,PART I.,Its tumbled shadow over
184,PART I.,"Wood-violet and the bramble-rose,"
185,PART I.,Long lady-fern and clover.
186,PART I.,
187,PART I.,Spice-seeded sassafras weighs deep
188,PART I.,"Rough rail and broken paling,"
189,PART I.,Where all day long the lizards sleep
190,PART I.,Like lichen on the railing.
191,PART I.,
192,PART I.,Behind you you will feel the moon's
193,PART I.,Gold stealing like young laughter;
194,PART I.,And mists--gray ghosts of picaroons--
195,PART I.,Its phantom treasure after.
196,PART I.,
197,PART I.,"And here together, youth and youth,"
198,PART I.,Love will be doubly able;
199,PART I.,"Each be to each as true as truth,"
200,PART I.,And dear as fairy fable.
201,PART I.,
202,PART I.,The owls are calling and the maize
203,PART I.,With fallen dew is dripping--
204,PART I.,"Ah, girlhood, through the dewy haze"
205,PART I.,Come like a moonbeam slipping.
206,PART I.,
207,PART I.,
208,PART I.,3.
209,PART I.,
210,PART I.,_He hums._
211,PART I.,
212,PART I.,"There is a fading inward of the day,"
213,PART I.,And all the pansy sunset hugs one star;
214,PART I.,"To eastward dwindling all the land is gray,"
215,PART I.,While barley meadows westward smoulder far.
216,PART I.,
217,PART I.,Now to your glass will you pass
218,PART I.,For the last time?
219,PART I.,"Pass,"
220,PART I.,Humming that ballad we know?--
221,PART I.,Here while I wait it is late
222,PART I.,And is past time--
223,PART I.,"Late,"
224,PART I.,"And love's hours they go, they go."
225,PART I.,
226,PART I.,There is a drawing downward of the night;
227,PART I.,The wedded Heaven wends married to the Moon;
228,PART I.,"Above, the heights hang golden in her light,"
229,PART I.,"Below, the woods bathe dewy in the June."
230,PART I.,
231,PART I.,There through the dew is it you
232,PART I.,Coming lawny?
233,PART I.,"You,"
234,PART I.,Or a moth in the vines?
235,PART I.,You!--at your throat I may note
236,PART I.,"Twinkling tawny,"
237,PART I.,"Note,"
238,PART I.,"A glow-worm, your brooch that shines."
239,PART I.,
240,PART I.,
241,PART I.,4.
242,PART I.,
243,PART I.,_She speaks._
244,PART I.,
245,PART I.,How many smiles in the asking?--
246,PART I.,Herein I can not deceive you;
247,PART I.,"My ""yes"" in a ""no"" was a-masking,"
248,PART I.,"Nor thought, dear, once to grieve you."
249,PART I.,I hid. The humming-bird happiness here
250,PART I.,Danced up i' the blood ... but what are words
251,PART I.,When the speech of two souls all truth affords?
252,PART I.,"Affirmative, negative what in love's ear?--"
253,PART I.,"I wished to say ""yes"" and somehow said ""no"";"
254,PART I.,"The woman within me knew you would know,"
255,PART I.,For it held you six times dear.
256,PART I.,
257,PART I.,
258,PART I.,_He speaks._
259,PART I.,
260,PART I.,So many hopes in a wooing!--
261,PART I.,Therein you could not deceive me;
262,PART I.,"The heart was here and the hope pursuing,"
263,PART I.,"Knew that you loved, believe me.--"
264,PART I.,Bunched bells o' the blush pomegranate--to fix
265,PART I.,At your throat; three drops of fire they are;
266,PART I.,And the maiden moon and the maiden star
267,PART I.,Sink silvery over yon meadow ricks.
268,PART I.,"Will you look?--till I hug your head back, so--"
269,PART I.,"For I know it is ""yes"" though you whisper ""no,""--"
270,PART I.,"And my kisses, sweet, are six."
271,PART I.,
272,PART I.,
273,PART I.,5.
274,PART I.,
275,PART I.,_She speaks._
276,PART I.,
277,PART I.,Could I recall every joy that befell me
278,PART I.,"There in the past with its anguish and bliss,"
279,PART I.,"Here in my heart it has whispered to tell me,"
280,PART I.,These were no joys to this.
281,PART I.,
282,PART I.,"Were it not well if our love could forget them,"
283,PART I.,Veiling the _was_ with the dawn of the _is_?
284,PART I.,"Dead with the past we should never regret them,"
285,PART I.,These were no joys to this.
286,PART I.,
287,PART I.,"When they were gone and the present stood speechful,"
288,PART I.,"Ardent with word and with look and with kiss,"
289,PART I.,"What though we know that their eyes are beseechful,"
290,PART I.,These were no joys to this.
291,PART I.,
292,PART I.,"Is it not well to have more of the spirit,"
293,PART I.,Living high futures this earthly must miss?
294,PART I.,Less of the flesh with the past pining near it?--
295,PART I.,Such is the joy of this.
296,PART I.,
297,PART I.,
298,PART I.,6.
299,PART I.,
300,PART I.,_She sings._
301,PART I.,
302,PART I.,"We will leave reason,"
303,PART I.,"Dear, for a season;"
304,PART I.,Reason were treason
305,PART I.,Since yonder nether
306,PART I.,Foot-hills are clad now
307,PART I.,In nothing sad now;
308,PART I.,"We will be glad now,"
309,PART I.,Glad as this weather.
310,PART I.,"Heart and heart! in the Maytime, Maytime,"
311,PART I.,"Youth and Love take playtime, playtime ..."
312,PART I.,I in the dairy; you are the airy
313,PART I.,Majesty passing; Love is the fairy
314,PART I.,Bringing us two together.
315,PART I.,
316,PART I.,
317,PART I.,_He sings._
318,PART I.,
319,PART I.,Starlight in masses
320,PART I.,"Of mist that passes,"
321,PART I.,Stars in the grasses;
322,PART I.,Star-bud and flower
323,PART I.,Laughingly know us;
324,PART I.,Secretly show us
325,PART I.,Earth is below us
326,PART I.,And for the hour
327,PART I.,"Soul has soul. In the Maytime, Maytime,"
328,PART I.,"Youth and Love take playtime, playtime ..."
329,PART I.,You are a song; a singer I hear it
330,PART I.,"Whispered in star and in flower; the spirit,"
331,PART I.,"Love, is the power."
332,PART I.,
333,PART I.,
334,PART I.,7.
335,PART I.,
336,PART I.,_He speaks._
337,PART I.,
338,PART I.,"And say we can not wed us now,"
339,PART I.,"Since roses and the June are here,"
340,PART I.,"Meseems, beneath the beechen bough"
341,PART I.,"'T is just as sweet, my doubly dear,"
342,PART I.,"To swear anew each old love vow,"
343,PART I.,And love another year.
344,PART I.,
345,PART I.,When breathe green woodlands through and through
346,PART I.,"Wild scents of heliotrope and rain,"
347,PART I.,"Where deep the moss mounds cool with dew,"
348,PART I.,"Beyond the barley-blowing lane,"
349,PART I.,"More wise than wedding, is to woo--"
350,PART I.,So we will woo again.
351,PART I.,
352,PART I.,All night I lie awake and mark
353,PART I.,"The hours by no clanging clock,"
354,PART I.,But in the dim and dewy dark
355,PART I.,Far crowing of some punctual cock;
356,PART I.,Until the lyric of the lark
357,PART I.,Mounts and Morn's gates unlock.
358,PART I.,
359,PART I.,And would you be a nun and miss
360,PART I.,All this delightful ache of love?
361,PART I.,Not have the moon for what she is?
362,PART I.,Love's honey-horn God holds above--
363,PART I.,"No world, for worlds are in a kiss"
364,PART I.,If worlds are good enough.
365,PART I.,
366,PART I.,"So say we can not wed us now,"
367,PART I.,Since roses and the June are here
368,PART I.,"We 'll stroll beneath the doddered bough,"
369,PART I.,"Heaven's mated songsters singing near,"
370,PART I.,"To swear anew each old love vow,"
371,PART I.,And love another year.
372,PART I.,
373,PART I.,
374,PART I.,8.
375,PART I.,
376,PART I.,_He opens his heart._
377,PART I.,
378,PART I.,And had we lived in the days
379,PART I.,"Of the Khalif Haroun er Reshid,"
380,PART I.,"We had loved, as the story says,"
381,PART I.,Did the Sultan's favorite one
382,PART I.,And the Persian Emperor's son
383,PART I.,"Ali ben Bekkar, he"
384,PART I.,Of the Kisra dynasty.
385,PART I.,
386,PART I.,Do you know the story well
387,PART I.,Of the Khalif Haroun's sultana?--
388,PART I.,"When night on the palace fell,"
389,PART I.,"A slave through a secret door,"
390,PART I.,"Low-arched on the Tigris' shore,"
391,PART I.,By a hidden winding stair
392,PART I.,Ben Bekkar brought to his fair?
393,PART I.,
394,PART I.,"Then there was laughter and mirth,"
395,PART I.,"And feasting and singing together,"
396,PART I.,In a chamber of marvellous worth;
397,PART I.,In a chamber vaulted high
398,PART I.,On columns of ivory;
399,PART I.,"Its dome, like the irised skies,"
400,PART I.,Mooned over with peacock eyes;
401,PART I.,"And the curtains and furniture,"
402,PART I.,Damask and juniper.
403,PART I.,
404,PART I.,Ten slave-girls--so many blooms--
405,PART I.,"Stand sconcing tamarisk torches,"
406,PART I.,Silk-clad from the Irak looms;
407,PART I.,"Ten handmaidens serve the feast,"
408,PART I.,Each like to a star in the East;
409,PART I.,"Ten singers, their lutes a-tune,"
410,PART I.,Each like to a bosomed moon.
411,PART I.,
412,PART I.,For her in the stuff of Merv
413,PART I.,"Blue-clad, unveiled, and jewelled,"
414,PART I.,No metaphor made may serve;
415,PART I.,"Scarved deep with her own dark hair,"
416,PART I.,The jewels like fire-flies there--
417,PART I.,"Blossom and moon and star,"
418,PART I.,The Lady Shemsennehar.
419,PART I.,
420,PART I.,"The zone embracing her waist,--"
421,PART I.,"The ransom of forty princes,--"
422,PART I.,But her form more priceless is placed;
423,PART I.,Carbuncles of Istakhar
424,PART I.,In her coronet burning are--
425,PART I.,"Though gems of the Jamshid race,"
426,PART I.,Far rarer the gem of her face.
427,PART I.,
428,PART I.,"Tall-shaped like the letter I,"
429,PART I.,With a face like an Orient morning;
430,PART I.,Eyes of the bronze-black sky;

432,PART I.,With the light of her language lit;
433,PART I.,"Cheeks, which the young blood dares"
434,PART I.,Make blood-red anemone lairs.
435,PART I.,
436,PART I.,"Kohled with voluptuous look,"
437,PART I.,"From opaline casting-bottles,"
438,PART I.,Handmaidens over them shook
439,PART I.,"Rose-water, and strewed with bloom"
440,PART I.,Mosaics old of the room;

442,PART I.,Or minted down golden dinars.
443,PART I.,
444,PART I.,"Roses of Rocknabad,"
445,PART I.,Hyacinths of Bokhara;--

449,PART I.,Pomegranates and bells of clear
450,PART I.,Tulips of far Kashmeer.
451,PART I.,
452,PART I.,And the chamber glows like a flower
453,PART I.,"Of the Tuba, or vale of El Liwa;"

472,PART I.,"Barbaric on free and slave,"

490,PART I.,With spray of spar on the cup.--
491,PART I.,

518,PART I.,In docile shadows under bluebell skies
519,PART I.,"A home upon the poppied edge of eve,"

532,PART I.,
533,PART I.,O country by the undiscovered sea!
534,PART I.,The dream infolds thee and the way is dim--

540,PART I.,
541,PART I.,"_He, after a pause, lightly._"
542,PART I.,
543,PART I.,An elf there is who stables the hot

545,PART I.,"An elf who rowels his spiteful bay,"
546,PART I.,"Like a mote on a ray, away, away;"
547,PART I.,An elf who saddles the hornet lean
548,PART I.,To din i' the ear o' the swinging bean;
549,PART I.,Who hunts with a hat cocked half awry
550,PART I.,The bottle-blue o' the dragon-fly:--
551,PART I.,"O ho, O hi! Oh, well know I."
552,PART I.,
553,PART I.,An elf there is where the clover tips
554,PART I.,"A horn whence the summer leaks and drips,"
555,PART I.,"Where lanthorns of mustard-flowers bloom,"
556,PART I.,In the dusk awaits the bee's dull boom;
557,PART I.,"Gay gold brocade from head to knee,"
558,PART I.,Who robs the caravan bumble-bee;
559,PART I.,Big bags of honey bee-merchants pay
560,PART I.,"To the bandit elf of the Fairy way,--"
561,PART I.,"O ho, O hey! I have heard them say."
562,PART I.,

565,PART I.,"Flowers, staining the dew-drops through,"
566,PART I.,Seals their colors in tubes of dew;
567,PART I.,Colors to dazzle the butterflies' wing--
568,PART I.,The evening moth is another thing:
569,PART I.,"The butterfly's glory he got at dawn,"
570,PART I.,The moon-moth's got when the moon was wan;
571,PART I.,"He it is, that the hollyhocks hear,"
572,PART I.,Who dangles a brilliant i' each one's ear;
573,PART I.,"Teases at noon the pane's green fly,"
574,PART I.,And lights at night the glow-worm's eye:--
575,PART I.,"O ho, O hi! Oh, well know I."
576,PART I.,
577,PART I.,"But the dearest elf, so the poets say,"
578,PART I.,Is the elf who hides in an eye of gray;
579,PART I.,Who curls in a dimple and slips along
580,PART I.,The strings of a lute or a lover's song;
581,PART I.,"Shines in a scent, or wings a rhyme,"
582,PART I.,And laughs in the bells of a wedding chime;
583,PART I.,"Hides unhidden, where none may know,"
584,PART I.,In her bosom's blossom or throat's blue bow--
585,PART I.,"O ho, O ho!--a friend or foe?"

589,PART I.,
590,PART I.,"_She, seriously._"
591,PART I.,
592,PART I.,"Who the loser, who the winner,"
593,PART I.,If the Fancy fail as preacher?--
594,PART I.,None who loved was yet beginner
595,PART I.,Though another's love-beseecher;
596,PART I.,Love's revealment 's of the inner
597,PART I.,"Life and deity, the teacher."
598,PART I.,
599,PART I.,Who may falsify the feeling
600,PART I.,To the lover who is loser?
601,PART I.,Has she felt:--the mere revealing
602,PART I.,Of the passion 's his accuser;
603,PART I.,She conceals it; the concealing
604,PART I.,Is her own love's self-abuser.
605,PART I.,
606,PART I.,"One hath said, no flower knoweth"
607,PART I.,Of the fragrance it revealeth;
608,PART I.,"Song, its soul that overfloweth,"

616,PART I.,_He._
617,PART I.,
618,PART I.,Handsels of anemones
619,PART I.,The surrendered hours

622,PART I.,Her unstudied flowers.
623,PART I.,
624,PART I.,"When 't is dawn, bestowing Day"
625,PART I.,Strews with coins of golden

646,PART I.,
647,PART I.,"How it was I can not tell,"

649,PART I.,And the beautiful befell
650,PART I.,In a land that does not lie
651,PART I.,East or West where mortals dwell--
652,PART I.,But beneath a vaguer sky.
653,PART I.,
654,PART I.,"Was it in the golden ages,"
655,PART I.,"Or the iron, that I heard,"
656,PART I.,"In prophetic speech of sages,"

658,PART I.,'Neath whose wing lay written pages
659,PART I.,Of an unknown lover's word?
660,PART I.,
661,PART I.,I forget; you may remember
662,PART I.,How the earthquake shook our ships;
663,PART I.,"How our city, one huge ember,"
664,PART I.,Blazed within the thick eclipse;
665,PART I.,When you found me--deep December
666,PART I.,Sealed on icy eyes and lips.
667,PART I.,
668,PART I.,I forget. No one may say
669,PART I.,Pre-existences are true:
670,PART I.,"Here 's a flower dies to-day,"
671,PART I.,Resurrected blooms anew:
672,PART I.,Death is dumb and Life is gray--

683,PART I.,"Here where your image is chief,"
684,PART I.,"Royal, to quicken or quell,"
685,PART I.,Swaying no sceptre of grief.
686,PART I.,
687,PART I.,Wise with the wisdom of Spring--
688,PART I.,"Dew-drops, a world in each prism,"
689,PART I.,Gems from the universe ring:--
690,PART I.,"Free of all creed and all schism,"
691,PART I.,Buds that are speechless but bring
692,PART I.,God-uttered God aphorism.
693,PART I.,
694,PART I.,See how the synod is met
695,PART I.,There of the planets to preach us--
696,PART I.,"Freed from the frost's oubliette,"
697,PART I.,Here how the flowers beseech us--
698,PART I.,Were it not well to forget
699,PART I.,Winter and night as they teach us?
700,PART I.,
701,PART I.,"Dew-drop, a bud, and a star,"
702,PART I.,These--each a separate thought
703,PART I.,Over man's logic how far!--
704,PART I.,God to a unit hath wrought--
705,PART I.,"Love, making these what they are,"
706,PART I.,For without love they were naught.
707,PART I.,
708,PART I.,Millions of stars; and they roll
709,PART I.,"Over your path that is white,"
710,PART I.,Here where we end the long stroll.--
711,PART I.,"Seen of the innermost sight,"

723,PART II.,"_She delays, meditating._"
724,PART II.,
725,PART II.,Sad skies and a foggy rain
726,PART II.,Dripping from streaming eaves;
727,PART II.,Over and over again
728,PART II.,Dead drop of the trickling leaves;
729,PART II.,"And the woodward winding lane,"
730,PART II.,"And the hill with its shocks of sheaves,"
731,PART II.,One scarce perceives.
732,PART II.,
733,PART II.,Must I go in such sad weather
734,PART II.,By the lane or over the hill?
735,PART II.,Where the splitting milk-weed's feather
736,PART II.,"Dim, diamond-like rain-drops fill?"
737,PART II.,"Or where, ten stars together,"

741,PART II.,"The creek by this is swollen,"

744,PART II.,In the race look dull and drowned;--
745,PART II.,'T is the path we oft have stolen
746,PART II.,"To the bridge, that rambles round"
747,PART II.,With willows crowned.
748,PART II.,
749,PART II.,Through a bottom wild with berry
750,PART II.,"Or packed with the iron-weeds,"
751,PART II.,With their blue combs washed and very
752,PART II.,Purple; the sorghum meads
753,PART II.,Glint green near a wilding cherry;
754,PART II.,Where the high wild-lettuce seeds
755,PART II.,The fenced path leads.
756,PART II.,
757,PART II.,A bird in the rain beseeches;
758,PART II.,And the balsams' budding balls
759,PART II.,Smell drenched by the way which reaches
760,PART II.,The wood where the water falls;
761,PART II.,Where the warty water-beeches
762,PART II.,"Hang leaves one blister of galls,"
763,PART II.,The mill-wheel drawls.
764,PART II.,
765,PART II.,My shawl instead of a bonnet!...
766,PART II.,Though the wood be soaking yet
767,PART II.,Through the wet to the rock I 'll run it--
768,PART II.,How sweet to meet in the wet!--
769,PART II.,"Our rock with the vine upon it,"

781,PART II.,White nenuphars about our boat
782,PART II.,This side the woodland we have reached;
783,PART II.,Two rapid strokes our skiff is beached.
784,PART II.,
785,PART II.,There is no path. Heaped foxgrapes choke
786,PART II.,Huge trunks they wrap. This giant oak
787,PART II.,Floods from the Alleghanies bore
788,PART II.,To wedge here by this sycamore;
789,PART II.,"Its wounded bulk, heart-rotted white,"
790,PART II.,Lights ghostly foxfire in the night.
791,PART II.,
792,PART II.,Now oar we through this willow fringe
793,PART II.,"The bulging shore that bosks,--a tinge"
794,PART II.,"Of green mists down the marge;--where old,"
795,PART II.,Scarred cottonwoods build walls of shade
796,PART II.,With breezy balsam pungent; bowled
797,PART II.,Around vined trunks the floods have made
798,PART II.,Concentric hollows. On we pass.
799,PART II.,
800,PART II.,"As we pass, we pass, we pass,"
801,PART II.,"In daisy jungles deep as grass,"

804,PART II.,A white-streaked woodpecker afar
805,PART II.,"Knocks: slant the sun dashed, each a star,"
806,PART II.,Three glittering jays flash over: slim
807,PART II.,The piping sand-snipes skip and skim
808,PART II.,Before us: and a finch or thrush--
809,PART II.,Who may discover where such sing?--
810,PART II.,The silence rinses with a gush
811,PART II.,Of mellow music gurgling.
812,PART II.,
813,PART II.,"On we pass, and onward oar"
814,PART II.,"To yon long lip of ragged shore,"
815,PART II.,"Where from yon rock spouts, babbling frore"
816,PART II.,A ferny spring; where dodging by
817,PART II.,Rests sulphur-disced that butterfly;
818,PART II.,"Mallows, rank crowded in for room,"
819,PART II.,'Mid wild bean and wild mustard bloom;
820,PART II.,Where fishers 'neath those cottonwoods

829,PART II.,
830,PART II.,Here the shores are irised; grasses
831,PART II.,Clump the water gray that glasses
832,PART II.,Broken wood and deepened distance:
833,PART II.,Far the musical persistence
834,PART II.,Of a field-lark lingers low
835,PART II.,In the west where tulips blow.
836,PART II.,
837,PART II.,White before us flames one pointed
838,PART II.,Star; and Day hath Night anointed
839,PART II.,King; from out her azure ewer
840,PART II.,"Pouring starry fire, truer"
841,PART II.,Than true gold. Star-crowned he stands
842,PART II.,With the starlight in his hands.
843,PART II.,
844,PART II.,Will the moon bleach through the ragged
845,PART II.,Tree-tops ere we reach yon jagged
846,PART II.,"Rock, that rises gradually?"
847,PART II.,Pharos of our homeward valley.
848,PART II.,Down the dusk burns golden-red;
849,PART II.,Embers are the stars o'erhead.
850,PART II.,
851,PART II.,At my soul some Protean elf is:
852,PART II.,"You 're Simaetha, I am Delphis;"

856,PART II.,'Round the violet Lesbian leas.
857,PART II.,
858,PART II.,On we drift. He loves you. Nearer
859,PART II.,"Looms our island. Rosier, clearer"
860,PART II.,"The Leucadian cliff we follow,"
861,PART II.,Where the temple of Apollo
862,PART II.,Lifts a pale and pillared fire--
863,PART II.,"Strike, oh, strike the Lydian lyre;"
864,PART II.,Out of Hellas blows the breeze
865,PART II.,Singing to the Sapphic seas.

874,PART II.,"Love, love, my love, and all the stars above us,"
875,PART II.,The stars above and every star a dream.
876,PART II.,
877,PART II.,"In odorous purple, where the falling warble"
878,PART II.,"Of water cascades and the plunged foam glows,"
879,PART II.,A columned ruin heaps its sculptured marble
880,PART II.,Curled with the chiselled rebeck and the rose.
881,PART II.,
882,PART II.,
883,PART II.,_She sings._
884,PART II.,
885,PART II.,"Sleep, Sleep, sweet Sleep sleeps at the drifting tiller,"

888,PART II.,"And, hark! the music of the harping main."
889,PART II.,
890,PART II.,What flowers are those that blow their balm unto us?
891,PART II.,Bow white their brows' aromas each a flame?
892,PART II.,"Ah, child, too kind the love we know, that knew us,"
893,PART II.,That kissed our eyes that we might see the same.

904,PART II.,_She._
905,PART II.,
906,PART II.,"Night! night! good night! and love's own star before thee,"

908,PART II.,"Yes, yes, ah yes! a presence to watch o'er thee--"
909,PART II.,Night! night! good night and good the gods to thee!
910,PART II.,
911,PART II.,
912,PART II.,5.
913,PART II.,
914,PART II.,_Homeward through flowers: she speaks._
915,PART II.,
916,PART II.,O simple offerings of the common hills;
917,PART II.,"Love's lowly names, that make you trebly sweet!"
918,PART II.,"One Johnny-jump-up, but an apron-full"
919,PART II.,"Of starry crowfoot, making mossy dells"
920,PART II.,Dim with heaven's morning blue; dew-dripping plumes
921,PART II.,"Of waxen ""dog-mouths""; red the tippling cups"
922,PART II.,"Of gypsy-lilies all along the creek,"
923,PART II.,"Where dull the freckled silence sleeps, and dark"
924,PART II.,"The water runs when, at high noon, the cows"
925,PART II.,Wade knee-deep and the heat hums drowsy with
926,PART II.,The drone of dizzy flies;--one Samson-flower
927,PART II.,Blue-streaked and crystal as a summer's cloud;
928,PART II.,"White violets, milk-weed, scarlet Indian-pinks,"
929,PART II.,All fragile-scented and familiar as
930,PART II.,Pink baby faces and blue infant eyes.
931,PART II.,
932,PART II.,O fair suggestions of a life more fair!
933,PART II.,"Love's fragrant whispers of an untaught faith,"
934,PART II.,High habitations 'neath a godlier blue
935,PART II.,"Beyond the sin of Earth, in heavens prepared--"
936,PART II.,"What is it?--halcyon to utter calm,"
937,PART II.,"Faith? such as wrinkled wisdom, doubting, has"
938,PART II.,"Yearned for and sought in miser'd lore of worlds,"
939,PART II.,"And vainly?--Love?--Oh, have I learned to live?"
940,PART II.,
941,PART II.,
942,PART II.,6.
943,PART II.,
944,PART II.,_He speaks._
945,PART II.,
946,PART II.,Would you have known it seeing it?
947,PART II.,Could you have seen it being it?
948,PART II.,Waving me out of the budding land
949,PART II.,"Sunbeam-jewelled a bloom-white hand,"
950,PART II.,"Wafting me life and hope and love,"
951,PART II.,"Life with the hope of the love thereof,"
952,PART II.,Love.
953,PART II.,
954,PART II.,"--""What is the value of knowing it?""--"
955,PART II.,Only the worth of owing it;
956,PART II.,Need of the bud contents the light;
957,PART II.,"Dew at dawn and nard at night,"
958,PART II.,"Beauty, aroma, honey at heart,"
959,PART II.,"Which is debtor, part for part,"
960,PART II.,Heart?
961,PART II.,
962,PART II.,"Thoughts, when the heart is heedable,"
963,PART II.,Then to the heart are readable;
964,PART II.,I in the texts of your eyes have read
965,PART II.,"Deep as the depth of the living dead,"
966,PART II.,Measures of truth in unsaid song
967,PART II.,"Learned from the soul to haunt me long,"
968,PART II.,Song.
969,PART II.,
970,PART II.,Love perpends each laudable
971,PART II.,"Thought of the soul made audible,"
972,PART II.,Said in gardens of bliss or pain:
973,PART II.,"Moonlight rays in drops of rain,"
974,PART II.,"Feels the faith in its sleep awake,"
975,PART II.,Wish of the silent words that shake
976,PART II.,Sleep.
977,PART II.,
978,PART II.,
979,PART II.,7.
980,PART II.,
981,PART II.,_She hums and muses._
982,PART II.,
983,PART II.,"_If love I have had of thee thou hadst of me,"
984,PART II.,No loss was in giving it over;
985,PART II.,"Could I give aught but that I had of thee,"
986,PART II.,Being no more than thy lover?_
987,PART II.,
988,PART II.,"And let it cease. When what befalls befalls,"
989,PART II.,"You cannot love me less,"
990,PART II.,"Loving me much now. Neither weeks nor walls,"
991,PART II.,"With bitterest distress,"
992,PART II.,
993,PART II.,"Shall all avail. Despair will find reprieve,"
994,PART II.,"Though dark the soul be tossed,"
995,PART II.,"In past possession of that love you grieve,"
996,PART II.,The love which you have lost.
997,PART II.,
998,PART II.,"Ponder the morning, or the midnight moon,"
999,PART II.,"The wilding of the wold,"
1000,PART II.,The morning slitting from night's brown cocoon
1001,PART II.,Wide wings of flaxen gold:
1002,PART II.,
1003,PART II.,"The moon that, had not darkness been before,"
1004,PART II.,Had never shone to lead;
1005,PART II.,"And think that, though you are, you are not poor,"
1006,PART II.,Since you have loved indeed.
1007,PART II.,
1008,PART II.,From flower to star read upward; you shall see
1009,PART II.,"The purposes of loss,"
1010,PART II.,"Deep hierograms of gracious deity,"
1011,PART II.,And comfort in your cross.
1012,PART II.,
1013,PART II.,
1014,PART II.,8.
1015,PART II.,
1016,PART II.,_She speaks._
1017,PART II.,
1018,PART II.,Sunday shall we ride together?
1019,PART II.,"Not the root-rough, rambling way"
1020,PART II.,"Through the woods we went that day,"
1021,PART II.,"In the sultry summer weather,"
1022,PART II.,
1023,PART II.,"Past the Methodist Camp-Meeting,"
1024,PART II.,Where religion helped the hymn
1025,PART II.,"Gather volume, and a slim"
1026,PART II.,Minister with textful greeting
1027,PART II.,
1028,PART II.,Welcomed us and still expounded.
1029,PART II.,From the service on the hill
1030,PART II.,We had rode three hills and still
1031,PART II.,Far away the singing sounded.
1032,PART II.,
1033,PART II.,Nor that road through weed and berry
1034,PART II.,Drowsy days led me and you
1035,PART II.,"To the old-time barbecue,"
1036,PART II.,Where the country-side made merry.
1037,PART II.,
1038,PART II.,Dusty vehicles together;
1039,PART II.,Darkies with the horses by
1040,PART II.,"'Neath the soft Kentucky sky,"
1041,PART II.,And a smell of bark and leather;
1042,PART II.,
1043,PART II.,"When you smiled, ""Our modern tourney:"
1044,PART II.,Gallantry and politics
1045,PART II.,"Dinner, dance and intermix."""
1046,PART II.,As we went the homeward journey
1047,PART II.,
1048,PART II.,"'Twixt hot chaparrals and thickets,"
1049,PART II.,"Heard brisk fiddles, scraping still,"
1050,PART II.,"Drone and thump the quaint quadrille,"
1051,PART II.,Like a worried band of crickets.--
1052,PART II.,
1053,PART II.,Neither road. The shady quiet
1054,PART II.,"Of that way by beech and birch,"
1055,PART II.,Winding to the ruined church
1056,PART II.,On the Fork that sparkles by it.
1057,PART II.,
1058,PART II.,Where the silent Sundays listen
1059,PART II.,"For the preacher whom we bring,"
1060,PART II.,In our hearts to preach and sing
1061,PART II.,Week-day shade to Sabbath glisten.
1062,PART II.,
1063,PART II.,
1064,PART II.,9.
1065,PART II.,
1066,PART II.,"_He, at parting._"
1067,PART II.,
1068,PART II.,"Yes, to-morrow; when the morn,"
1069,PART II.,"Pentecost of flame, uncloses"
1070,PART II.,"Portals that the stars adorn,"
1071,PART II.,Whence a golden presence throws his
1072,PART II.,Fiery swords and burning roses
1073,PART II.,"At the wide wood's world of wall,"
1074,PART II.,Spears of sparkle at each fall;
1075,PART II.,
1076,PART II.,Then together let us ride
1077,PART II.,"Down deep-wood cathedral places,"
1078,PART II.,"Where the pilgrim wild-flowers hide,"
1079,PART II.,Praying Sabbath in their faces;
1080,PART II.,"Where in truest untaught phrases,"
1081,PART II.,"Worship in each rhythmic word,"
1082,PART II.,Sings no migratory bird....
1083,PART II.,
1084,PART II.,Pearl on pearl the high stars dight
1085,PART II.,Jewels of divine devices
1086,PART II.,'Round the Afric throat of Night;
1087,PART II.,Where yon misty glimmer rises
1088,PART II.,Soon the white moon crystallizes
1089,PART II.,"Out of darkness, like a spell.--"
1090,PART II.,"Late, 't is late. Till dawn, farewell."

1096,PART III.,
1097,PART III.,
1098,PART III.,1.
1099,PART III.,
1100,PART III.,"Now rests the season in forgetfulness,"
1101,PART III.,Careless in beauty of maturity;
1102,PART III.,"The ripened roses 'round brown temples, she"
1103,PART III.,Fulfils completion in a dreamy guess:
1104,PART III.,Now Time grants night the more and day the less;
1105,PART III.,The gray decides; and brown
1106,PART III.,Dim golds and reds in dulling greens express
1107,PART III.,Themselves and broaden as the year goes down.
1108,PART III.,"Sadder the croft where, thrusting gray and high"
1109,PART III.,"Their balls of seeds, the hoary onions die,"
1110,PART III.,"Where, Falstaff-like, buff-bellied pumpkins lie:"
1111,PART III.,Deeper each wilderness;
1112,PART III.,Sadder the blue of hills that lounge along
1113,PART III.,The lonesome west; sadder the song
1114,PART III.,"Of the wild red-bird in the leafage yellow,"
1115,PART III.,"Deeper and dreamier, aye!"
1116,PART III.,"Than woods or waters, leans the languid sky"
1117,PART III.,Above lone orchards where the cider-press
1118,PART III.,Drips and the russets mellow.
1119,PART III.,
1120,PART III.,Nature grows liberal; under woodland leaves
1121,PART III.,"The beech-nuts' burs their little pockets poke,"
1122,PART III.,Plump with the copper of the nuts that choke;
1123,PART III.,Above our bristling way the spider weaves
1124,PART III.,A glittering web for which the Dawn designs
1125,PART III.,"Thrice twenty rows of sparkles. By the oak,"
1126,PART III.,"That rolls old roots in many gnarly lines,"
1127,PART III.,"The acorn thimble, smoothly broke,"
1128,PART III.,Shines by its saucer. On sonorous pines
1129,PART III.,The far wind organs; but the forest here
1130,PART III.,To no weak breeze hath woke;
1131,PART III.,"Far off the wind, but crumbling near and near,--"
1132,PART III.,"Each tingling twig expectant, and the gray"
1133,PART III.,"Surmise of heaven pilots it the way,"
1134,PART III.,"Rippling the leafy spines,"
1135,PART III.,"Until the wildwood, one exultant sway,"
1136,PART III.,"Booms, and the sunlight, arrowing through it, shines"
1137,PART III.,Visible applause you hear.
1138,PART III.,
1139,PART III.,How glows the garden! though the white mists keep
1140,PART III.,The vagabond in flowers reminded of
1141,PART III.,"Decay that comes to slay in open love,"
1142,PART III.,"When the full moon hangs cold and night is deep,"
1143,PART III.,Unheeding such their cardinal colors leap
1144,PART III.,Gay in the crescent of the blade of death;
1145,PART III.,"Spaced innocents in swaths he weeps to reap,"
1146,PART III.,"Waiting his scythe a breath,"
1147,PART III.,To gravely lay them dead with one last sweep.--
1148,PART III.,"Long, long admire"
1149,PART III.,Their splendors manifold:--
1150,PART III.,The scarlet salvia showered with spurts of fire;
1151,PART III.,"Cascading lattices, dark vines that creep,"
1152,PART III.,Nightshade and cypress; there the marigold
1153,PART III.,Burning--a shred of orange sunset caught
1154,PART III.,And elfed in petals that eve's goblins brought
1155,PART III.,"From elfland; there, predominant red,"
1156,PART III.,The dahlia lifts its head
1157,PART III.,"By the white balsams' red-bruised horns of honey,"
1158,PART III.,In humming spaces sunny.
1159,PART III.,The crickets singing dirges noon and night
1160,PART III.,"For morn-born flowers, at dusk already dead,"
1161,PART III.,For dusk-dead flowers weep;
1162,PART III.,"While tired Summer white,"
1163,PART III.,"Where yonder aster whispering odor rocks,--"
1164,PART III.,"The withered poppies knotted in her locks,--"
1165,PART III.,"Sighs, 'mong her sleepy hollyhocks asleep."
1166,PART III.,
1167,PART III.,
1168,PART III.,2.
1169,PART III.,
1170,PART III.,"The hips were reddening on the rose,"
1171,PART III.,The haws hung slips of fire;
1172,PART III.,We went the woodland way that goes
1173,PART III.,Up hills of branch and briar.
1174,PART III.,The hooked thorn held her gown and seemed
1175,PART III.,Imploring her be staying
1176,PART III.,The sunlight of herself that beamed
1177,PART III.,Beside it gently swaying.
1178,PART III.,
1179,PART III.,Low bent the golden saxifrage;
1180,PART III.,Its yellow bells like bangles
1181,PART III.,The foxglove fluttered. Like a page--
1182,PART III.,From out the rail-fence angles--
1183,PART III.,"With crimson plume the sumach, hosed"
1184,PART III.,"In Lincoln green, attended"
1185,PART III.,"My lady of the elder, posed"
1186,PART III.,In blue-black jewels splendid.
1187,PART III.,
1188,PART III.,And as we mounted up the hill
1189,PART III.,The rocky path that stumbled
1190,PART III.,Spread smooth; and all the day was still
1191,PART III.,And odorous with umbled
1192,PART III.,Tops of wild-carrots drying gray;
1193,PART III.,"And there, soft-sunned before us,"
1194,PART III.,An orchard dwindling away
1195,PART III.,With dappled boughs bent o'er us.
1196,PART III.,
1197,PART III.,An orchard where the pippin fell
1198,PART III.,"Worm-bitten, bruised, and dusty;"
1199,PART III.,"And hornet-stung, each like a bell,"
1200,PART III.,The Bartlett ripened rusty;
1201,PART III.,"The smell of tawny peach and plum,"
1202,PART III.,That offered luscious yellow;
1203,PART III.,"Of wasp and bee the hidden hum,"
1204,PART III.,Made all the warm air mellow.
1205,PART III.,
1206,PART III.,And on we went where many-hued
1207,PART III.,"Hung wild the morning-glory,"
1208,PART III.,"Their blue balloons in shadows, dewed"
1209,PART III.,With frost-white dew-drops hoary;
1210,PART III.,In bush and burgrass far away
1211,PART III.,"Beneath us stretched the valley,"
1212,PART III.,Cleft by one creek that laughed with day
1213,PART III.,And babbled musically.
1214,PART III.,
1215,PART III.,"The brown, the bronze, the gray, the red"
1216,PART III.,Of weed and briar ran riot
1217,PART III.,Flush to dark woodland walls that led
1218,PART III.,To nooks of whispering quiet.
1219,PART III.,"Long, feathering bursts of golden-rod"
1220,PART III.,Ran golden woolly patches--
1221,PART III.,Bloom-sunsets of the withered sod
1222,PART III.,The dying summer catches.
1223,PART III.,
1224,PART III.,"Then o'er the hills, loose-tumbling rolled--"
1225,PART III.,O'erleaping expectation--
1226,PART III.,"The sunset, flaming marigold,"
1227,PART III.,A system's conflagration:
1228,PART III.,"And homeward turning, she and I"
1229,PART III.,Went as one self in being--
1230,PART III.,God met us in the earth and sky
1231,PART III.,And Love had purged our seeing.
1232,PART III.,
1233,PART III.,
1234,PART III.,3.
1235,PART III.,
1236,PART III.,"Say, my dear, O my dear,"
1237,PART III.,These are the eves for speaking;
1238,PART III.,There is no wight will work us spite
1239,PART III.,Beneath the sunset's streaking.
1240,PART III.,
1241,PART III.,"Yes, my dear, O my dear,"
1242,PART III.,These are the eves for telling;
1243,PART III.,To walk together in starry weather
1244,PART III.,Ere springs o' the moon are welling.
1245,PART III.,
1246,PART III.,"O my dear, yes, my dear,"
1247,PART III.,These are the dusks for staying;
1248,PART III.,When twilight dreams of night who seems
1249,PART III.,Among long-purples praying.
1250,PART III.,
1251,PART III.,"""No, my dear!""--""Yes, my dear!"""
1252,PART III.,These are the nights to kiss it
1253,PART III.,Times twice-a-twenty: they grow a-plenty
1254,PART III.,On lips that will not miss it.
1255,PART III.,
1256,PART III.,
1257,PART III.,4.
1258,PART III.,
1259,PART III.,To dream where silence sleeps
1260,PART III.,A sorrow's sleep that sighs;
1261,PART III.,Where all heaven's azure peeps
1262,PART III.,Blue from one wildflower's eyes
1263,PART III.,"Where, in reflecting deeps,--"
1264,PART III.,"Of cloudier woods and skies,--"
1265,PART III.,Another gray world lies.
1266,PART III.,
1267,PART III.,Divining God from things
1268,PART III.,Humble as weeds and bees;
1269,PART III.,From songs the free bird sings
1270,PART III.,Learn all are vain but these;
1271,PART III.,"In light-delighted springs,"
1272,PART III.,"Wise, star-familiar trees,"
1273,PART III.,Seek love's philosophies.
1274,PART III.,
1275,PART III.,
1276,PART III.,5.
1277,PART III.,
1278,PART III.,"Here where the days are dimmest,"
1279,PART III.,"Each old, big-hearted tree"
1280,PART III.,Gives bounteous sympathy;
1281,PART III.,Here where dead nights sit grimmest
1282,PART III.,In druid company;
1283,PART III.,Here where the days are dimmest.
1284,PART III.,
1285,PART III.,"Leaves of my lone communion,"
1286,PART III.,Leaves; and the listening sigh
1287,PART III.,Of silence wanders by;
1288,PART III.,While on my soul the union
1289,PART III.,Is--of the wood and sky--
1290,PART III.,Leaves of my lone communion.
1291,PART III.,
1292,PART III.,"And eyes with tears are aching,"
1293,PART III.,While life waits wistfully
1294,PART III.,For love that may not be:
1295,PART III.,In visions vain of waking
1296,PART III.,Lives all it can not see.--
1297,PART III.,"And eyes with tears are aching,"
1298,PART III.,And eyes with tears are aching.
1299,PART III.,
1300,PART III.,
1301,PART III.,6.
1302,PART III.,
1303,PART III.,And here alone I sit and see it so.
1304,PART III.,"A vale of willows swelling into knobs,"
1305,PART III.,A bulwark eastward. Sloping low
1306,PART III.,Westward the scooping waters flow
1307,PART III.,Under a rocky culvert's arch that throbs
1308,PART III.,With clanging wheels of transient trains that go
1309,PART III.,Screaming to north and south.
1310,PART III.,"Here all the weary waters, stagnant stayed,"
1311,PART III.,Sleep at the culvert's mouth;
1312,PART III.,"The current's hungry hiccup still afraid,"
1313,PART III.,"Haply, that I should never know"
1314,PART III.,The secret 'neath the striate scum o' the stream
1315,PART III.,"The devil and the dream,"
1316,PART III.,"I, dropping gravels so the echo sob"
1317,PART III.,Mocking and thin as music of a shade
1318,PART III.,"In shades that wring from rocks a hollow woe,"
1319,PART III.,Complaining phantoms of faint whispers rob.
1320,PART III.,
1321,PART III.,"There, up the valley where the lank grass leaps"
1322,PART III.,"Blades each a crooked kris,"
1323,PART III.,The currents strike or miss
1324,PART III.,Dream melodies: No wide-belled mallow sleeps
1325,PART III.,Monandrous flowers oval as a kiss;
1326,PART III.,No mandrake curling convolutions up
1327,PART III.,"Loops heavy blossoms, each a conical cup"
1328,PART III.,That swoons moon-nectar and a serpent's hiss;
1329,PART III.,"No tiger-lily, where the crayfish play,"
1330,PART III.,"Mirrors a savage face, a copper hue"
1331,PART III.,Streaked with a crimson dew;
1332,PART III.,No dragon-fly in endless error keeps
1333,PART III.,Sewing the pale-gold gown of day
1334,PART III.,"With tangled stitches of a burning blue,--"
1335,PART III.,"Whose brilliant body but a needle is,"
1336,PART III.,An azurn and incarnate ray:--
1337,PART III.,"But here, where haunted with the shade,"
1338,PART III.,"The dull stream stales and dies,"
1339,PART III.,"Are beauties none or few,"
1340,PART III.,Such sinister and new;
1341,PART III.,And one at widest noon-gaze shrinks afraid
1342,PART III.,Beneath the timid skies;
1343,PART III.,"So, if you ask me why I answer this:--"
1344,PART III.,
1345,PART III.,You know not; only where the kildees wade
1346,PART III.,"There in the foamy scum,"
1347,PART III.,"There where the wet rocks ail,--"
1348,PART III.,"Low rocks to which the water-reptiles come,"
1349,PART III.,"Basking pied bodies in the brindled shade,--"
1350,PART III.,Dim as a bubble's prism on the grail
1351,PART III.,"Below, an angled sparkle rayed,"
1352,PART III.,While lights and shadows aid
1353,PART III.,"From breeze-blown clouds that lounge at sunny loss,"
1354,PART III.,"Deep down, a sense of wavy features quail"
1355,PART III.,The heart; with lips that writhe and fade
1356,PART III.,"And clench; tough, rooty limbs that twist and cross,"
1357,PART III.,And flabby hair of smoky moss.
1358,PART III.,
1359,PART III.,A brimstone sunset. And at night
1360,PART III.,The twinkling flies in will-o'-the-wisp dance wheel
1361,PART III.,"Through copse and open, all a gnomish green."
1362,PART III.,"I hear the water, and the wave is white"
1363,PART III.,"There where the boulder plants a keel,"
1364,PART III.,And each taunt ripple 's sheen.--
1365,PART III.,Where instant insects dot
1366,PART III.,"The dark with spurts of sulphur--bright,"
1367,PART III.,"Beneath the hazy height,"
1368,PART III.,"No bitter-almond trees make wan the night,"
1369,PART III.,"Building bloom ridges of a ghostly lustre,"
1370,PART III.,But white-tops tossing cluster over cluster:
1371,PART III.,Huge-seen within that twilight spot--
1372,PART III.,"As if a hill-born giant, half asleep,"
1373,PART III.,Had dropped his night-cap while he drove his sheep
1374,PART III.,Foldward through fallow browns
1375,PART III.,"And foxy grays,--a something crowns"
1376,PART III.,The knoll--is it the odorous peak
1377,PART III.,Of one June-savory timothy stack?
1378,PART III.,
1379,PART III.,"Now, one dead ash behind,"
1380,PART III.,A weak moon shows a withered cheek
1381,PART III.,"Of Quaker quiet, wasted o'er the vines'"
1382,PART III.,Appentice ruins roofing pillared pines:
1383,PART III.,"Beyond these, back and back,"
1384,PART III.,An oak-wood stretches black--
1385,PART III.,And here the whining were-wolves of the wind
1386,PART III.,"Snuff snarling: but their eyes are blind,"
1387,PART III.,Although their fangs are fierce;
1388,PART III.,And though they never pierce
1389,PART III.,"Beyond the bad, bedevilled woodland streak,"
1390,PART III.,"I hear them, yes, I hear"
1391,PART III.,"A padding o' footsteps near,"
1392,PART III.,A prowling pant in ear
1393,PART III.,And can not fly!--yes!--no!--
1394,PART III.,"What horror holds me?--That uncoiling slow,"
1395,PART III.,"Sure, mastering chimera there,"
1396,PART III.,Hooping firm unseen feelers 'round my neck
1397,PART III.,"A binding, bruising coil ..."
1398,PART III.,The waters burn and boil;
1399,PART III.,The fire-flies the dappled darkness fleck
1400,PART III.,With impish dabs of blazing wizard's oil ...
1401,PART III.,"Deep, deep into the black eye of the beck"
1402,PART III.,"I stare, magnetic fixed, and little reck"
1403,PART III.,"If all the writhing shadow slips,"
1404,PART III.,"Dripping around me, to the eyes and hips,"
1405,PART III.,Where grinning murder leers with lupine lips.
1406,PART III.,
1407,PART III.,
1408,PART III.,7.
1409,PART III.,
1410,PART III.,What can it mean for me? what have I done to her?
1411,PART III.,I in our freedom of love as a sun to her;
1412,PART III.,She to our liberty goddess and slumberless
1413,PART III.,Moon of the stars shining silver and numberless:
1414,PART III.,"Who on my life, that was thorny and showery,"
1415,PART III.,Came--and made dewyness; smiled--and made flowery;
1416,PART III.,Mine! the affinitized one of humanity:
1417,PART III.,Mine! the elected of soul over vanity--
1418,PART III.,"What have I done to her, what have I done!"
1419,PART III.,
1420,PART III.,What can it mean for me? what have I said to her?
1421,PART III.,"I, who have idolized, worshipped, and pled to her;"
1422,PART III.,"Sung for her, laughed for her, sorrowed and sighed for her,"
1423,PART III.,"Lived for her, hated and gladly had died for her!"
1424,PART III.,See; she has written me thus! she has written me--
1425,PART III.,Sooner would dagger or serpent had smitten me!
1426,PART III.,Would they had shrivelled or ever they'd read of it!
1427,PART III.,"Eyes, that are wide to the bitterest dread of it--"
1428,PART III.,"What have I said to her, what have I said!"
1429,PART III.,
1430,PART III.,"What shall I make of it, I, who am trembling"
1431,PART III.,"Fearful of loss?--Oh, enamored, dissembling"
1432,PART III.,"Flame!--of the candle that burning, but guttering,"
1433,PART III.,Flatters the moth that comes circling and fluttering
1434,PART III.,"Out of the summer night; trusting, importunate,"
1435,PART III.,Quitting cool flowers for this--O unfortunate!--
1436,PART III.,"Such has she been to me making me such to her,"
1437,PART III.,"Slaying me, saying I never was much to her--"
1438,PART III.,"What shall I make of it, what can I make!"
1439,PART III.,
1440,PART III.,"Love, in thy everglades, moaning and motionless"
1441,PART III.,"Look, I have fallen; the evil is potionless:"
1442,PART III.,"I, with no thought but the heavens that lock us in,"
1443,PART III.,"Set naked feet 'mid the cottonmouth, moccasin"
1444,PART III.,"Under wild-roses, the Cherokee, eying me:--"
1445,PART III.,"In the sweet blue with the egrets that, flying me,"
1446,PART III.,"Loosened like blooms from magnolias, rose slenderly"
1447,PART III.,White and pale pink; where the mocking-bird tenderly
1448,PART III.,"Sang, making vistas of mosses melodious,"
1449,PART III.,Wandered unheeding my steps in the odious
1450,PART III.,Slime that was venom; I followed the fiery
1451,PART III.,Violet curve of thy star falling wiry--
1452,PART III.,"So was I lost in night, thus am undone!..."
1453,PART III.,
1454,PART III.,Have I not told to her--living alone for her--
1455,PART III.,Purposed unfoldments of love I had sown for her
1456,PART III.,Here in the soil of my soul? their variety
1457,PART III.,Endless; and ever she answered with piety.--
1458,PART III.,See! it has come to this ... all the tale's suavity
1459,PART III.,At the ninth chapter grows stupid with gravity;
1460,PART III.,Duller than death all our beautiful history--
1461,PART III.,Close it!--the _finis_ is more than a mystery.--
1462,PART III.,"Yes, I will tell her this; yes, I will tell."
1463,PART III.,
1464,PART III.,
1465,PART III.,8.
1466,PART III.,
1467,PART III.,I seem to hear her speak and see
1468,PART III.,That blue-hung room. Her perfume comes
1469,PART III.,From lavender folds vined dreamily--
1470,PART III.,"A-blossom with brocaded blooms,--"
1471,PART III.,A stuff of Orient looms.
1472,PART III.,
1473,PART III.,"Again I hear her speak and back,"
1474,PART III.,"Where steals the showery sunlight, piles"
1475,PART III.,A whatnot dainty bric-a-brac
1476,PART III.,Beside a tall clock; each glazed tile's
1477,PART III.,Blue-patterned profile smiles.
1478,PART III.,
1479,PART III.,"I hear her say, ""Ah, had we known,"
1480,PART III.,Could what has been have ever been?--
1481,PART III.,"And now!""... How hurt the hard ache shone"
1482,PART III.,In eyes whose sadness seemed to lean
1483,PART III.,"On something far, unseen!"
1484,PART III.,
1485,PART III.,And as in sleep my own self seems
1486,PART III.,Outside my suffering self: I flush
1487,PART III.,In mists of undetermined dreams;
1488,PART III.,Behold her musing in that hush
1489,PART III.,Of lilac light and plush.
1490,PART III.,
1491,PART III.,"Smiling but tortured. Yes, I feel"
1492,PART III.,"Despite that face, not seeming sad,"
1493,PART III.,In those calm temples thoughts like steel
1494,PART III.,Remorseless bore. I had gone mad
1495,PART III.,Had I once deemed her glad.
1496,PART III.,
1497,PART III.,"Unconsciously, with eyes that yearn"
1498,PART III.,"To pierce beyond the present far,"
1499,PART III.,"Searching some future hope, I turn;--"
1500,PART III.,"There in her garden one fierce star,"
1501,PART III.,"Beyond the window's bar,--"
1502,PART III.,
1503,PART III.,"Vermilion as a storm-sunk sun,--"
1504,PART III.,A phyllocactus?--all the life
1505,PART III.,Of torrid middays in but one
1506,PART III.,Rich crimson bloom--flames red as strife;
1507,PART III.,"And near it, rankly rife--"
1508,PART III.,
1509,PART III.,Deep coreopsis?--heavy hues
1510,PART III.,"Of soft seal-bronze and satiny gold,"
1511,PART III.,Sway girandoles whose jets of dews
1512,PART III.,"Burn points of starlight diamond-cold,"
1513,PART III.,"Warm-colored, manifold."
1514,PART III.,
1515,PART III.,She dare not speak; I can not. Yet
1516,PART III.,An intercourse 'twixt brain and brain
1517,PART III.,"Goes feverish on.--Crushed, smelling wet,"
1518,PART III.,Through silken curtains drift again
1519,PART III.,Verbena-scents of rain.
1520,PART III.,
1521,PART III.,I in the doorway turn and stay;
1522,PART III.,Angry her cameo beauty mark
1523,PART III.,Set in that smile--Oh! will she say
1524,PART III.,No farewell? no regret? one spark
1525,PART III.,Of hope to cheer the dark?
1526,PART III.,
1527,PART III.,That sepia-sketch--conceive it so--
1528,PART III.,A roguish head with jaunty eyes
1529,PART III.,"Laughing beneath a rose-chapeau,"
1530,PART III.,"Silk-masked, unmasking--it denies"
1531,PART III.,The full-faced flower surprise;
1532,PART III.,
1533,PART III.,Hung o'er her davenport.... We read
1534,PART III.,The true beneath the false; perceive
1535,PART III.,The smile that hides the ache.--Indeed!
1536,PART III.,_Whose_ soul unmasks?... not mine!--I grieve
1537,PART III.,"Here, here, but laugh and leave...."
1538,PART III.,
1539,PART III.,
1540,PART III.,9.
1541,PART III.,
1542,PART III.,Beyond the knotty apple-trees
1543,PART III.,"That fade about the old brick-barn,"
1544,PART III.,Its tattered arms and tattered knees
1545,PART III.,A scare-crow tosses to the breeze
1546,PART III.,Among the shocks of corn.
1547,PART III.,
1548,PART III.,All things grow gray in earth and sky;
1549,PART III.,The cold wind sounding drearily
1550,PART III.,Makes all the rusty branches fly;
1551,PART III.,The rustling leaves a-rotting lie;
1552,PART III.,The year is waning wearily.
1553,PART III.,
1554,PART III.,At night I hear the far wild geese
1555,PART III.,"Honk in frost-bitten heavens, under"
1556,PART III.,Arcturus. Though I seem to cease
1557,PART III.,"Outside myself and sleep in peace,"
1558,PART III.,I drowse awake and wonder.
1559,PART III.,
1560,PART III.,I know torn thistles by the creek
1561,PART III.,Hang hairy with the frost; the tented
1562,PART III.,Brown acres of the corn stretch bleak
1563,PART III.,"And ghostly in the moonlight, weak"
1564,PART III.,In hollows bitter-scented.
1565,PART III.,
1566,PART III.,Dream back the ways we strolled at morn
1567,PART III.,Through woods of summer ever singing;
1568,PART III.,"Moon-trysts beneath the crooked thorn,"
1569,PART III.,The tasselled meads of cane and corn
1570,PART III.,Their restless shadows swinging....
1571,PART III.,
1572,PART III.,I stand and oar our boat among
1573,PART III.,The dripping lilies of the river;
1574,PART III.,I reach her hat the grape-vine long
1575,PART III.,"Struck in the stream; we sing a song,"
1576,PART III.,That song ... I wake and shiver.
1577,PART III.,
1578,PART III.,And then my feverish mind reverts
1579,PART III.,To our sad words and sadder parting
1580,PART III.,"In days long gone; and, oh! it hurts"
1581,PART III.,"Within here, for the soul asserts"
1582,PART III.,Mine the fool fault from starting.
1583,PART III.,
1584,PART III.,And I must lie awake and think
1585,PART III.,Of her with such regrets as gladly
1586,PART III.,No unrebuking conscience shrink;
1587,PART III.,And hear the wild-fowls' clangor sink
1588,PART III.,Through plaintive starlight sadly.
1589,PART III.,
1590,PART III.,When all are overflown and deep
1591,PART III.,"The stoic night is left forsaken,"
1592,PART III.,"For company I well would weep,"
1593,PART III.,"Since all my spirit fears to sleep,"
1594,PART III.,Sleep of such visions shaken.
1595,PART III.,
1596,PART III.,Grave visions of dead deeds that flaw
1597,PART III.,"Our waking hours, ever haunting;"
1598,PART III.,"Else were we, lacking love and law,"
1599,PART III.,Rude scare-crow things of sticks and straw
1600,PART III.,Undaunted and undaunting.
1601,PART III.,
1602,PART III.,
1603,PART III.,10.
1604,PART III.,
1605,PART III.,The sun a splintered splendor was
1606,PART III.,"In sober trees that broke and blurred,"
1607,PART III.,That afternoon we went together
1608,PART III.,"In droning hum and whirling buzz,"
1609,PART III.,"Where hard the dinning locust whirred,"
1610,PART III.,Through fields of golden-rod a-feather.
1611,PART III.,
1612,PART III.,So sweet it was to look and lean
1613,PART III.,To your young face and feel the light
1614,PART III.,Of eyes that fondled mine unsaddened!
1615,PART III.,The laugh that left lips more serene;
1616,PART III.,The words that blossomed like the white
1617,PART III.,Life-everlasting there and gladdened.
1618,PART III.,
1619,PART III.,"Maturing Summer, you were fraught"
1620,PART III.,With wiser beauties then than now
1621,PART III.,Parades rich Autumn's red November;
1622,PART III.,This stuns: there dreams no subtle thought
1623,PART III.,As then on hinting bush and bough--
1624,PART III.,"But now I am alone, remember."
1625,PART III.,
1626,PART III.,
1627,PART III.,11.
1628,PART III.,
1629,PART III.,Through iron-weeds and roses
1630,PART III.,"And bronzing beech and oak,"
1631,PART III.,"Old porches it discloses,"
1632,PART III.,Above the briars and roses
1633,PART III.,Fall's feeble sunbeams soak.
1634,PART III.,
1635,PART III.,Neglected walks that tangle
1636,PART III.,The dodder-strangled grass;
1637,PART III.,Its chimney shows one angle
1638,PART III.,Heaped with dead leaves that spangle
1639,PART III.,The paths that round it pass.
1640,PART III.,
1641,PART III.,The early mists that bury
1642,PART III.,"And hide them in its rooms,"
1643,PART III.,From spider closets--very
1644,PART III.,Dim with old webs--will hurry
1645,PART III.,Out in the raining glooms.
1646,PART III.,
1647,PART III.,They haunt each stair and basement;
1648,PART III.,They stand on hearth and porch;
1649,PART III.,"Lean from each paneless casement,"
1650,PART III.,Or in the moonlight's lacement
1651,PART III.,Fly with a phantom torch.
1652,PART III.,
1653,PART III.,There is a sense of frost here;
1654,PART III.,And gusts that sob away
1655,PART III.,"Of something that was lost here,"
1656,PART III.,"Long, long ago was lost here,"
1657,PART III.,"But what, they can not say."
1658,PART III.,
1659,PART III.,There croons no owl to startle
1660,PART III.,Despondency within;
1661,PART III.,No raven o'er its portal
1662,PART III.,To scare the daring mortal
1663,PART III.,And guard its cellared sin.
1664,PART III.,
1665,PART III.,The creaking road descries it
1666,PART III.,This side the dusty toll;
1667,PART III.,The farmer passing eyes it;
1668,PART III.,"None stops t' philosophize it,"
1669,PART III.,This symbol of a soul.
1670,PART III.,
1671,PART III.,
1672,PART III.,12.
1673,PART III.,
1674,PART III.,Though the dog-tooth violet come
1675,PART III.,"With the shower,"
1676,PART III.,And the wild-bee haunt and hum
1677,PART III.,"Every flower,"
1678,PART III.,We shall never wend as when
1679,PART III.,Love laughed leading us from men
1680,PART III.,"Over violet vale and glen,"
1681,PART III.,"Where the red-bird sang an hour,"
1682,PART III.,And we heard the partridge drum.
1683,PART III.,
1684,PART III.,"Here October shadows pray,"
1685,PART III.,Till one stills
1686,PART III.,"Joyance, where for buried May"
1687,PART III.,Sob the rills:
1688,PART III.,So love's vision has arisen
1689,PART III.,Of the long ago: I listen--
1690,PART III.,"Memory, tears in eyes that glisten"
1691,PART III.,Points but Indiana hills
1692,PART III.,Fading dark-blue far away.
1693,PART III.,
1694,PART III.,
1695,PART III.,
1696,PART III.,
1697,PART IV.,PART IV.
1698,PART IV.,
1699,PART IV.,
1700,PART IV.,1.
1701,PART IV.,
1702,PART IV.,When in her cloudy chiton
1703,PART IV.,"Spring freed the donjoned rills,"
1704,PART IV.,"And trumpeting, a Triton,"
1705,PART IV.,Wind-war was on the hills;
1706,PART IV.,"O'er ways, hope's buds bedizen,"
1707,PART IV.,"Long ways the glory lies on,"
1708,PART IV.,Love spread us an horizon
1709,PART IV.,Of gold beyond life's ills.
1710,PART IV.,
1711,PART IV.,When Summer came with sickle
1712,PART IV.,"Stuck in a sheaf of gleams,"
1713,PART IV.,And eves were honey-trickle
1714,PART IV.,From bee-hives of the beams;
1715,PART IV.,"Scrolls of the days blue-blotted,"
1716,PART IV.,"Scrolls of the night star-dotted,"
1717,PART IV.,To love and us allotted
1718,PART IV.,A world of woven dreams.
1719,PART IV.,
1720,PART IV.,When Autumn waited tired--
1721,PART IV.,A fair-faced heretic--
1722,PART IV.,_Auto-de-f√©s_ Frost fired
1723,PART IV.,In Winter's Bishopric;
1724,PART IV.,"Our loves, a song had started,"
1725,PART IV.,"Grew with the song sad-hearted,"
1726,PART IV.,"Sweet loves long-sworn were parted,"
1727,PART IV.,Though life for love was sick.
1728,PART IV.,
1729,PART IV.,Now is the Winter waited
1730,PART IV.,"'Neath skies of frozen gold,"
1731,PART IV.,Or raining heavens hated
1732,PART IV.,Of winds that curse and scold.--
1733,PART IV.,Shall this be so: that never
1734,PART IV.,Shall sunlight snowlight sever?
1735,PART IV.,Forever and forever
1736,PART IV.,The heart wait winter-cold?
1737,PART IV.,
1738,PART IV.,
1739,PART IV.,2.
1740,PART IV.,
1741,PART IV.,Soft music bring that seems to weep
1742,PART IV.,All this dull sorrow of the soul;
1743,PART IV.,"Vague music soft to utter sleep,"
1744,PART IV.,Sleep and undying dole:
1745,PART IV.,Forgetting not--forgotten most--
1746,PART IV.,How love is well though lost.
1747,PART IV.,
1748,PART IV.,"So weary, oh! and yet so fain"
1749,PART IV.,In silent service of the heart;
1750,PART IV.,Still feeling if it be in vain
1751,PART IV.,Love's spirit hath His part;
1752,PART IV.,And if in death God grant the rest
1753,PART IV.,Life were but kind at best.
1754,PART IV.,
1755,PART IV.,
1756,PART IV.,3.
1757,PART IV.,
1758,PART IV.,Last night I slept till midnight
1759,PART IV.,"Then woke, and far away"
1760,PART IV.,A cock crowed; lonely and distant
1761,PART IV.,Came mournful a watch-dog's bay;
1762,PART IV.,"But lonelier, slower the tedious"
1763,PART IV.,Old clock ticked on towards day.
1764,PART IV.,
1765,PART IV.,And what a day!--remember
1766,PART IV.,"The morns of a Summer and Spring,"
1767,PART IV.,That bound two lives together?
1768,PART IV.,Each morn a wedding ring
1769,PART IV.,"Of dew and dreams and sparkle,"
1770,PART IV.,Of flowers and birds a-wing?
1771,PART IV.,
1772,PART IV.,Broad morns when I strolled the garden
1773,PART IV.,Awaiting one the rose
1774,PART IV.,"Expected, fresh in its blushes--"
1775,PART IV.,The Giant of Battle that grows
1776,PART IV.,"A head of radiance and fragrance,"
1777,PART IV.,The champion of the close.
1778,PART IV.,
1779,PART IV.,"Not in vain did I wait, departed"
1780,PART IV.,"Summer, this morning mocks;"
1781,PART IV.,'Mid the powdery crystal and crimson
1782,PART IV.,Of your hollow hollyhocks;
1783,PART IV.,"Your fairy-bells and poppies,"
1784,PART IV.,And the bee that in them rocks.
1785,PART IV.,
1786,PART IV.,Cool-clad 'mid the pendulous purple
1787,PART IV.,"Of the morning-glory vine,"
1788,PART IV.,By the giant pearls pellucid
1789,PART IV.,"Of the peonies a-line,"
1790,PART IV.,The snapdragons' and the pansies'
1791,PART IV.,Deep-colored jewel mine.
1792,PART IV.,
1793,PART IV.,"Shall I ever see my mealy,"
1794,PART IV.,Drunk dusty-millers gay;
1795,PART IV.,My lady-slippers bashful
1796,PART IV.,Of butterfly and ray;
1797,PART IV.,My gillyflowers as spicy
1798,PART IV.,Each as a day of May?
1799,PART IV.,
1800,PART IV.,"Oh, dear when I think of the handfuls"
1801,PART IV.,"Of little gold coin a-mass,"
1802,PART IV.,My bachelor's-buttons scatter
1803,PART IV.,Over the garden grass;
1804,PART IV.,Of the marigold that boasts its
1805,PART IV.,One bit of burning brass;
1806,PART IV.,
1807,PART IV.,More bitter I feel the winter
1808,PART IV.,Tighten to spirit and heart;
1809,PART IV.,And dream of the days remembered
1810,PART IV.,As lost--of the past a part;
1811,PART IV.,"Of the ways we went, all blotted,"
1812,PART IV.,Tear-blotted on love's chart.
1813,PART IV.,
1814,PART IV.,And I see the mill and the diamonds
1815,PART IV.,Of foam tossed from its wheel;
1816,PART IV.,"Red lilies tumbled together,"
1817,PART IV.,The madcap wind at heel;
1818,PART IV.,And the timid veronicas' blossoms--
1819,PART IV.,Those prayers the woods conceal.
1820,PART IV.,
1821,PART IV.,The wild-cat gray of the meadows
1822,PART IV.,"That the ox-eyed daisies dot,"
1823,PART IV.,"Fawn-eyed and a leopard-yellow,"
1824,PART IV.,That tangle a tawny spot--
1825,PART IV.,As if some panther tired
1826,PART IV.,Lay dozing tame and hot.
1827,PART IV.,
1828,PART IV.,"Ah! back again with the present,"
1829,PART IV.,With winds that pinch and twist
1830,PART IV.,"Each leaf in their peevish passion,"
1831,PART IV.,And whirl wherever they list;
1832,PART IV.,"With the morning hoary and nipping,"
1833,PART IV.,Whose mausolean mist
1834,PART IV.,
1835,PART IV.,Builds white a tomb for the daylight--
1836,PART IV.,"A frosty, shaggy fog,"
1837,PART IV.,"That fits gray wigs on the cedars,"
1838,PART IV.,And furs with wool each log;
1839,PART IV.,"Carpets with satin the meadow,"
1840,PART IV.,And velvets white the bog.
1841,PART IV.,
1842,PART IV.,Alone at morn--indifferent;
1843,PART IV.,Alone at eve--I sigh;
1844,PART IV.,"And wait, like the wind complaining,"
1845,PART IV.,Complain and know not why;
1846,PART IV.,But ailing and longing and hating
1847,PART IV.,Because I cannot die.
1848,PART IV.,
1849,PART IV.,How dull are the sunsets! dreary
1850,PART IV.,"Cold, hard and harsh and dead!"
1851,PART IV.,"Far richer were those of August,"
1852,PART IV.,One stain of wine-dark red--
1853,PART IV.,The juice of a mulberry vintage--
1854,PART IV.,To the new moon overhead.
1855,PART IV.,
1856,PART IV.,But now I sit with the sighing
1857,PART IV.,Dead wests of a dying year!
1858,PART IV.,Like the fallen leaves and the acorns
1859,PART IV.,Am worthless and feel as sear;
1860,PART IV.,"For the soul and the body sicken,"
1861,PART IV.,And the heart's one scalding tear.
1862,PART IV.,
1863,PART IV.,"And I stare from my window! The darkness,"
1864,PART IV.,"Like a bravo, his cloak throws on;"
1865,PART IV.,"The moon, like a hidden lanthorn,"
1866,PART IV.,Glitters--or dagger drawn;
1867,PART IV.,All my heart cries out beseeching:
1868,PART IV.,"""Strike here! strike and be gone!"""
1869,PART IV.,
1870,PART IV.,
1871,PART IV.,4.
1872,PART IV.,
1873,PART IV.,When friends are sighing
1874,PART IV.,Round one and one
1875,PART IV.,"Nearer is lying,"
1876,PART IV.,"Nearer the sun,"
1877,PART IV.,When one is dying
1878,PART IV.,And all is done;
1879,PART IV.,
1880,PART IV.,"I may remember,"
1881,PART IV.,You may forget
1882,PART IV.,"Words, each an ember,"
1883,PART IV.,Burning here yet--
1884,PART IV.,In dead December
1885,PART IV.,One will regret.
1886,PART IV.,
1887,PART IV.,"Love we have given,"
1888,PART IV.,"Over and o'er,"
1889,PART IV.,"All, who has driven"
1890,PART IV.,"Us from his door,"
1891,PART IV.,Is he forgiven
1892,PART IV.,When he is poor?
1893,PART IV.,
1894,PART IV.,"What if you wept once,"
1895,PART IV.,What though he knew!
1896,PART IV.,What if he slept once!
1897,PART IV.,"Still he was true,"
1898,PART IV.,If he but kept once
1899,PART IV.,Something of you.
1900,PART IV.,
1901,PART IV.,"Never forgetful,"
1902,PART IV.,Love may forget;
1903,PART IV.,"Froward and fretful,"
1904,PART IV.,"Child, he will fret;"
1905,PART IV.,"Ever regretful,"
1906,PART IV.,He will regret.
1907,PART IV.,
1908,PART IV.,Love would be sweeter
1909,PART IV.,If we but knew;
1910,PART IV.,Lives be completer
1911,PART IV.,To themselves true;
1912,PART IV.,"Hearts more in metre,"
1913,PART IV.,Truth looking through.
1914,PART IV.,
1915,PART IV.,"Flesh never near it,"
1916,PART IV.,"Being impure,"
1917,PART IV.,Mind must endear it
1918,PART IV.,Making it sure--
1919,PART IV.,"Love in the spirit,"
1920,PART IV.,That will endure.
1921,PART IV.,
1922,PART IV.,So when to-morrow
1923,PART IV.,Ceases and we
1924,PART IV.,"Quit this we borrow,"
1925,PART IV.,"Mortality,"
1926,PART IV.,Such chastens sorrow
1927,PART IV.,So it may see.
1928,PART IV.,
1929,PART IV.,"There will be weeping,"
1930,PART IV.,"Weary and deep,--"
1931,PART IV.,God's be the keeping
1932,PART IV.,Of those that weep!--
1933,PART IV.,"When our loved, sleeping,"
1934,PART IV.,Sleep their long sleep;
1935,PART IV.,
1936,PART IV.,Then they are dearer
1937,PART IV.,Than we're aware;
1938,PART IV.,"Character clearer,"
1939,PART IV.,Being more fair;
1940,PART IV.,"Then they are nearer,"
1941,PART IV.,Nearer by prayer.
1942,PART IV.,
1943,PART IV.,
1944,PART IV.,5.
1945,PART IV.,
1946,PART IV.,"They will not say I can not live beyond the weary night,"
1947,PART IV.,But then I know that I shall die before comes morning's light.
1948,PART IV.,How frail is flesh!--but you 'll forgive me now I tell you how
1949,PART IV.,"I loved you, love you; and the pain it gives to leave you now?"
1950,PART IV.,
1951,PART IV.,"This could not be on earth; the flesh, that clothes the soul of me--"
1952,PART IV.,Ordained at birth a sacrifice to this heredity--
1953,PART IV.,"Denied, forbade.--Ah, you have seen the bright spots in my cheeks"
1954,PART IV.,"Grow hectic, as before comes night blood dyes the sunset's streaks?"
1955,PART IV.,
1956,PART IV.,"Consumption. ""But I promised you my love""--'t is left forlorn"
1957,PART IV.,"Of life God summons unto him, and is it then forsworn?"
1958,PART IV.,"Oh, I was glad in love of you; but think: if I had died"
1959,PART IV.,Ere babe of mine had come to be a solace at your side?
1960,PART IV.,
1961,PART IV.,"Had it been little then, your grief, when Heaven had made us one"
1962,PART IV.,In everything that's good on earth and then the good undone?
1963,PART IV.,No! no!--and had I lived to raise a boy we saw each day
1964,PART IV.,"Bud into beauty, with that blight born in him that must slay!"
1965,PART IV.,
1966,PART IV.,"Just when we cherish him the most, and youthful, sunny pride"
1967,PART IV.,"Sits on his curly front, he pines and dies ere I have died."
1968,PART IV.,"Whose fault?--not mine! but hers or his, that ancestor who gave"
1969,PART IV.,Escutcheon to our humble house--a death's-head and a grave.
1970,PART IV.,
1971,PART IV.,Beneath the pomp of those grim arms we live and may not move;
1972,PART IV.,"Nor faith, nor fame, nor wealth avail to hurl them down, nor love."
1973,PART IV.,How could I tell you this?--not then! when all the world was spun
1974,PART IV.,Of morning colors for our love to walk and dance upon.
1975,PART IV.,
1976,PART IV.,"I could not tell you how disease hid here a viper germ,"
1977,PART IV.,Precedence slowly claiming and so slowly fixing firm.
1978,PART IV.,"And when I broke our plighted troth and would not tell you why,"
1979,PART IV.,"I loved you, thinking ""time enough when I have come to die."""
1980,PART IV.,
1981,PART IV.,Draw off my rings and let my hands rest so ... the wretched cough
1982,PART IV.,Will interrupt my feeble speech and will not be put off....
1983,PART IV.,"Ah, anyhow, my anodyne is this--to feel that you"
1984,PART IV.,"Are near me, that your healthy hand soothes mine's unhealthy dew."
1985,PART IV.,
1986,PART IV.,"And that your heart excuses all, and that you will not fret"
1987,PART IV.,Because you understand me now and never will forget.--
1988,PART IV.,"Now bring me roses pale and pure and tell me death's a lie,"
1989,PART IV.,"--Late was it hard for me to live, now it is hard to die."

1997,PART V.,1.
1998,PART V.,
1999,PART V.,"Vased in her bedroom window, white"
2000,PART V.,"As her glad girlhood, never lost,"
2001,PART V.,I smelt the roses; and the night
2002,PART V.,Outside was fog and frost.
2003,PART V.,
2004,PART V.,What though I claimed her dying there!
2005,PART V.,God nor one angel understood
2006,PART V.,"Nor cared, who from loved feet to hair"
2007,PART V.,Had changed to mist her blood.
2008,PART V.,
2009,PART V.,"Love, love had claimed us long, and long"
2010,PART V.,"Our hearts sang harp-strung, late and soon;"
2011,PART V.,But God!--God jangles thus the song
2012,PART V.,And makes discord of tune.
2013,PART V.,
2014,PART V.,What lily lilier than her face!
2015,PART V.,More virgin than her lips I kissed!
2016,PART V.,"When morn like God, with gold and grace"
2017,PART V.,Broke massed in mist! broke massed in mist!
2018,PART V.,
2019,PART V.,
2020,PART V.,2.
2021,PART V.,
2022,PART V.,"Love, to your face farewell now,"
2023,PART V.,Pillowed a flower on flowers;
2024,PART V.,"Eyes, white-weighed with a spell now;"
2025,PART V.,"Lips, with nothing to tell now,"
2026,PART V.,That bade adieu to ours.
2027,PART V.,
2028,PART V.,"Dear, is your soul so daggered"
2029,PART V.,There by a world that hates?
2030,PART V.,Love--is _he_ ever laggard?
2031,PART V.,Hope--is _her_ face so haggard?
2032,PART V.,"You, who are one with the Fates?"
2033,PART V.,
2034,PART V.,Never to wait to-morrow
2035,PART V.,Under such worldly skies!
2036,PART V.,Never to sleep with sorrow!
2037,PART V.,Hour by hour to borrow
2038,PART V.,Joy that has only sighs!
2039,PART V.,
2040,PART V.,"Sweet, farewell forever;"
2041,PART V.,And a burning tear or two--
2042,PART V.,"Will they reach your knowledge ever,"
2043,PART V.,And touch through the dreams that sever
2044,PART V.,My life from the life of you?
2045,PART V.,
2046,PART V.,"O Life, in my flesh so fearful"
2047,PART V.,Medicine me this pain!
2048,PART V.,"Thy eyes with a science cheerful,"
2049,PART V.,"But mine, with a mystery tearful,"
2050,PART V.,Tearful and slumber-fain.
2051,PART V.,
2052,PART V.,"Love, to your lips farewell now--"
2053,PART V.,Your spirit through them I kiss;
2054,PART V.,Lips--so sealed with a spell now!
2055,PART V.,"Lips, with nothing to tell now"
2056,PART V.,But this! but this! but this!...
2057,PART V.,
2058,PART V.,
2059,PART V.,3.
2060,PART V.,
2061,PART V.,"So long it seems since last I saw her face,"
2062,PART V.,"So long ago it seems,"
2063,PART V.,"Like some sad soul, in unconjectured space,"
2064,PART V.,Lost in the happiness of some dead grace
2065,PART V.,"Remembered--I. And, oh! a little while"
2066,PART V.,The sorrow stabs and Death conceals no smile
2067,PART V.,From Love bowed weeping in a thorny place--
2068,PART V.,"So long ago, our love is what are dreams!"
2069,PART V.,
2070,PART V.,"Since she is gone no more I feel the light,"
2071,PART V.,"Since she is gone beyond,"
2072,PART V.,"Burst like a revelation out of night,--"
2073,PART V.,"Golden convictions of far futures bright,--"
2074,PART V.,Whiles clouds around the west take marble tones;
2075,PART V.,"For Hope sits sighing in a place of stones,"
2076,PART V.,"Dark locks dishevelled and face very white,--"
2077,PART V.,Since she is gone and life's an iron bond.
2078,PART V.,
2079,PART V.,"Now she is dead the doubt Love dulled with awe,"
2080,PART V.,"Now she is dead to me,"
2081,PART V.,Questions the wisdom of diviner law.
2082,PART V.,Self-solved of self I search to find a flaw--
2083,PART V.,O egotism of Earth's fools and slaves!--
2084,PART V.,"For Faith leans thoughtful in a place of graves,"
2085,PART V.,"On that unseen from this seen known to draw,"
2086,PART V.,Now she is dead and it is hard to see.
2087,PART V.,
2088,PART V.,
2089,PART V.,4.
2090,PART V.,
2091,PART V.,Ridged and bleak the gray forsaken
2092,PART V.,"Twilight at the night has guessed,"
2093,PART V.,Where no star of dusk has taken
2094,PART V.,Flame unshaken in the west.
2095,PART V.,
2096,PART V.,All the day the woodlands dying
2097,PART V.,"Moaned, and drippings as of grief"
2098,PART V.,Tossed from barren boughs with sighing
2099,PART V.,Death of flying twig and leaf.
2100,PART V.,
2101,PART V.,"Ah, to be a dream unbroken,"
2102,PART V.,Past the ironies of Fate!
2103,PART V.,Born a tree; with branches oaken
2104,PART V.,Dear unspoken intimate.
2105,PART V.,
2106,PART V.,Who may say that man has never
2107,PART V.,Lived the mighty hearts of trees?
2108,PART V.,"Graduating Godward ever,"
2109,PART V.,The Forever finds through these?
2110,PART V.,
2111,PART V.,"Colors, we have lived, are cherished;"
2112,PART V.,"Odors, we have been, are ours;"
2113,PART V.,Entity alone has perished;
2114,PART V.,Beauty-nourished souls were flowers.
2115,PART V.,
2116,PART V.,"Music, when the fancy guesses,"
2117,PART V.,Lifts us loftier thoughts among;
2118,PART V.,"Spirit that the flesh distresses,"
2119,PART V.,But expresses self with song....
2120,PART V.,
2121,PART V.,Heaven in darkness bends upbraiding
2122,PART V.,"Without moonlight, without star;"
2123,PART V.,"Darkness and the reason aiding,"
2124,PART V.,All but fading phantoms are.
2125,PART V.,
2126,PART V.,Still philosophy is saying:
2127,PART V.,"""Now that hope with life seems gone,"
2128,PART V.,"Some are cursing, some are praying,"
2129,PART V.,"God smiles raying in the dawn!"""
2130,PART V.,
2131,PART V.,
2132,PART V.,5.
2133,PART V.,
2134,PART V.,Wild weather; the whip of the sleet
2135,PART V.,On the shuttered casement tapping;
2136,PART V.,"A shadow from face to feet,"
2137,PART V.,"Like a shroud, my spirit wrapping,"
2138,PART V.,
2139,PART V.,Wild weather; and how is she
2140,PART V.,"Now the sting of the storm beats serried,"
2141,PART V.,Over the stone and the tree
2142,PART V.,Of the grave where she is buried?
2143,PART V.,
2144,PART V.,Wild weather; I cannot weep--
2145,PART V.,But the skies weep on and worry;
2146,PART V.,"So I sleep, and dream in my sleep"
2147,PART V.,How I hear dim garments hurry....
2148,PART V.,
2149,PART V.,Star weather and footsteps of stars;
2150,PART V.,"And I see white raiment glisten,"
2151,PART V.,Like the glow on the face of Mars
2152,PART V.,When the stars to the angels listen.
2153,PART V.,
2154,PART V.,And with me I see how she stands
2155,PART V.,With lips high thought has weighted;
2156,PART V.,"With testifying hands,"
2157,PART V.,And eyes with purity mated.
2158,PART V.,
2159,PART V.,Have I spoken and have I kneeled
2160,PART V.,"To the prayer I worship, I wonder?--"
2161,PART V.,What waits on her lips that are sealed?
2162,PART V.,God-sealed and who shall sunder!
2163,PART V.,
2164,PART V.,"I sob, ""Oh your stay was long!"
2165,PART V.,"You are come, but your feet were laggard,"
2166,PART V.,With mansuetude and song
2167,PART V.,"For a heart your death has daggered."""
2168,PART V.,
2169,PART V.,And I lift wet eyes to her
2170,PART V.,"Unutterable with weeping,"
2171,PART V.,"And beg for the loves that were,"
2172,PART V.,Now passed into Heaven's keeping....
2173,PART V.,
2174,PART V.,I wake and a clock tolls three--
2175,PART V.,And the night and the storm lie serried
2176,PART V.,"On the testament that's she,"
2177,PART V.,"Closed, clasped, and forever buried."
2178,PART V.,
2179,PART V.,
2180,PART V.,6.
2181,PART V.,
2182,PART V.,The night is shrewd with storm and sleet;
2183,PART V.,Each loose-warped casement raps or groans;
2184,PART V.,I hear the wailing woodland beat
2185,PART V.,"The tempest with long blatant moans,"
2186,PART V.,Like one who fears defeat.
2187,PART V.,
2188,PART V.,"And sitting here beyond the storm,"
2189,PART V.,"Alone within the lonely house,"
2190,PART V.,It seems of Sleep the Fairy charm
2191,PART V.,Weaves incantations; even the mouse
2192,PART V.,That scratched has come to harm.
2193,PART V.,
2194,PART V.,"And in this grave light, stolen o'er"
2195,PART V.,"Familiar objects, grown severe,"
2196,PART V.,"I 'm strange--as, opening a door,"
2197,PART V.,"One finds one's dead self standing near,"
2198,PART V.,One knew not dead before.
2199,PART V.,
2200,PART V.,The old stair rings with growling gusts;
2201,PART V.,Each hearth's flue gasps a gorgon throat
2202,PART V.,"That snores and sleeps; the spectral dusts,"
2203,PART V.,"Which yonder Shawnee war-gear coat,"
2204,PART V.,"Whose quiver hangs and rusts,"
2205,PART V.,
2206,PART V.,"Are shaken; till I feel that he,"
2207,PART V.,"Who wore it in the wild war-dance,"
2208,PART V.,"And died in it, fills shadowy"
2209,PART V.,"Its wampumed skins; its plume, perchance,"
2210,PART V.,"Shakes, scowling eyes at me."
2211,PART V.,
2212,PART V.,And so the Swedenborge I toss
2213,PART V.,"Aside, contented with the dark"
2214,PART V.,That takes me. O'er the fire-light cross;
2215,PART V.,"Pass where the andirons spit and spark,"
2216,PART V.,And ponder o'er her loss.
2217,PART V.,
2218,PART V.,Or from the flaw-splashed window yearn
2219,PART V.,"Out toward the waste, where sway and dip"
2220,PART V.,"Dank, dark December boughs, where burn"
2221,PART V.,"Some late last leaves, that icy drip"
2222,PART V.,No matter where you turn.
2223,PART V.,
2224,PART V.,"Where sodden soil, you scarce have trod,"
2225,PART V.,Fills oozy footprints; and the night
2226,PART V.,"So ugly that it mocks at God,"
2227,PART V.,Creating monsters which the sight
2228,PART V.,"Fancies, unseen, abroad."
2229,PART V.,
2230,PART V.,The months I count: how long it seems
2231,PART V.,"Since that bland summer when with her,"
2232,PART V.,"There on her porch, in rainy gleams"
2233,PART V.,We watched the mellow lightning stir
2234,PART V.,In rain-clouds gray as dreams!
2235,PART V.,
2236,PART V.,When all the west a torn gold sheet--
2237,PART V.,Swift openings of some Titan's forge--
2238,PART V.,Laid bald with storm; in quivering heat
2239,PART V.,"Pitched precipice and nightmare gorge,"
2240,PART V.,Where thunder torrents beat.
2241,PART V.,
2242,PART V.,And strong the wind was as again
2243,PART V.,Storm lit the instant earth; and how
2244,PART V.,The wood sprang out one virent stain;
2245,PART V.,We read no more--lost is it now!--
2246,PART V.,In _Romance of a Reign_;
2247,PART V.,
2248,PART V.,A tale of nowhere; then that we
2249,PART V.,Were reading till we heard the plunge
2250,PART V.,"Of distant thunder sullenly,"
2251,PART V.,And left to mark long lightnings lunge
2252,PART V.,Convulsions fiery.
2253,PART V.,
2254,PART V.,"What worlds love wrought us, dreaming there,"
2255,PART V.,Of sorcery and necromance!
2256,PART V.,"With spirits lustrous of the air,"
2257,PART V.,"A land like one great pearl, a trance"
2258,PART V.,Of floods and forests fair.
2259,PART V.,
2260,PART V.,Where white-faced flowers sang and thought;
2261,PART V.,"Where fragrant birds flew, brilliant-blown,"
2262,PART V.,In winging odors; feather-fraught
2263,PART V.,"With light, where breathing colors shone,"
2264,PART V.,On throbbing music brought.
2265,PART V.,
2266,PART V.,Or built us some snug country home
2267,PART V.,Among the hills; with terraces
2268,PART V.,Vine-hung and orchared o'er the foam
2269,PART V.,"Of the Ohio, far one sees"
2270,PART V.,Wind crimson in the gloam.
2271,PART V.,
2272,PART V.,And this! and this!--alone! alone!
2273,PART V.,"To hear the sweep of winter rain,"
2274,PART V.,The missiled sleet's sharp arrows blown;
2275,PART V.,"Dark shadow on the freezing pane,"
2276,PART V.,And on my heart a moan!

2287,DAYS AND DREAMS.,Down rocks of sullen dye.

2740,THE EVE OF ALL-SAINTS.,And the moon like a twisted torch
2741,THE EVE OF ALL-SAINTS.,Burned over one lonesome larch;

3130,ELPHIN.,"She spun the flax of a spindle,"
3131,ELPHIN.,And I watched a little space.
3132,ELPHIN.,
3133,ELPHIN.,But nerves of my manhood weakened;

3142,ELPHIN.,"But I knew how the charm was mastered,"
3143,ELPHIN.,And snapped in the hissing vein;
