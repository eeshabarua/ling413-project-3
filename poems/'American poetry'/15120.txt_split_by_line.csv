103,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN
104,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,
105,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"He was a burly Dutch tenor,"
106,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,And I patiently trailed him in his waking and sleeping hours
107,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"That I might not lose a story,--"
108,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,But his life was commonplace and unimaginative--
109,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"Air raids and abdications kept his activities,"
110,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"(A game of bridge yesterday, a ride to Tarrytown),"
111,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Out of the papers.
112,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"I watchfully waited,"
113,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Yearning a coup that would place him on the
114,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Musical map.
115,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"A coup, such as kissing a Marshal Joffre,"
116,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,"Aeroplaning over the bay,"
117,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Diving with Annette Kellerman.
118,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Then for three days I quit the city
119,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,To get a simple contralto into the western papers.
120,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Returning I entered my office; the phone jangled.
121,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,The burly tenor was tearfully sobbing and moaning over the wire;
122,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Tremor and emotion choked his throat.
123,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,This was his ominous message:
124,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,A taxicab accident almost had killed him two and one half days ago;
125,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,He had escaped with his body and orchid-lined voice--
126,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,And not a line in the mornings or evenings!
127,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,What could I do about it?
128,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,Accidents will happen.
129,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,
130,ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN,
131,THE BARITONE,THE BARITONE
132,THE BARITONE,
133,THE BARITONE,He was a wonderful Metropolitan singer.
134,THE BARITONE,"His name had been blazoned over these United States,"
135,THE BARITONE,And in Europe it was as well known.
136,THE BARITONE,Records of him could be bought in the smallest hamlet;
137,THE BARITONE,Nothing but praise had been shed upon the glory of his name.
138,THE BARITONE,In May he was scheduled to sing in Chicago
139,THE BARITONE,At a festival where thousands were to foregather
140,THE BARITONE,To do praise to him and his voice.
141,THE BARITONE,"Two days before he left, he came to his manager's office"
142,THE BARITONE,With a sickly expression all over his rotund face
143,THE BARITONE,And a deathly gasp in his voice.
144,THE BARITONE,"One thought he needed a doctor,"
145,THE BARITONE,Or the first aid of some Red Cross nurses.
146,THE BARITONE,He was ushered into the private office
147,THE BARITONE,To find out his trouble.
148,THE BARITONE,This was his lament in short;
149,THE BARITONE,"A friend, in the hurry of the moment,"
150,THE BARITONE,Had procured tickets for him on the Twentieth Century
151,THE BARITONE,"Which demanded an extra fare of six dollars,--"
152,THE BARITONE,And he wanted to ride on the cheapest train.
153,THE BARITONE,So we got him tickets on another road
154,THE BARITONE,"Which takes thirty six hours to Chicago and perhaps more,"
155,THE BARITONE,"And the great singer, whose name has been blazoned over these United States"
156,THE BARITONE,"And was as well known in Europe,"
157,THE BARITONE,Walked out contented and smiling like a young boy.
158,THE BARITONE,
159,THE BARITONE,
160,PATRIOTISM,PATRIOTISM
161,PATRIOTISM,
162,PATRIOTISM,The patriotic orchestra of eighty five men
163,PATRIOTISM,Was keyed to an extraordinary patriotic pitch
164,PATRIOTISM,"For these were patriotic concerts,"
165,PATRIOTISM,"Supported by the leading patriots of the town,"
166,PATRIOTISM,"(Including a Bulgarian merchant, an Austrian physician and a German lawyer),"
167,PATRIOTISM,And all the musicians were getting union wages--and in the summer at that.
168,PATRIOTISM,So they were patriotic too.
169,PATRIOTISM,"The Welsh conductor was also patriotic,"
170,PATRIOTISM,"For his name on the program was larger than that of the date or the hall,"
171,PATRIOTISM,But when the manager asked him to play a number
172,PATRIOTISM,"Designated as ""Dixie,"""
173,PATRIOTISM,He disposed of it shortly with the words:
174,PATRIOTISM,"""It is too trivial--that music."""
175,PATRIOTISM,"And, instead, he played a lullaby by an unknown Welsh composer,--"
176,PATRIOTISM,(Because he was a Welshman)....
177,PATRIOTISM,The audience left after the concert was over
178,PATRIOTISM,"And complimented itself individually and collectively on ""doing its bit"""
179,PATRIOTISM,By attending and listening to these patriotic concerts.

182,THE PILLOW CASES,THE PILLOW CASES
183,THE PILLOW CASES,
184,THE PILLOW CASES,"The train was due to arrive at eleven that night,"
185,THE PILLOW CASES,But owing to the usual delay it did not arrive until one.
186,THE PILLOW CASES,The reporters of the leading dailies
187,THE PILLOW CASES,Were still waiting grouchily on the station platform for the great star.
188,THE PILLOW CASES,"For weeks his name had blotted out every bare wall,"
189,THE PILLOW CASES,And the date sheets of his coming had reddened the horizon.
190,THE PILLOW CASES,"Now he steps off the train, tired and disgruntled."
191,THE PILLOW CASES,What cares he for the praise of the public and their prophets
192,THE PILLOW CASES,Awaiting him impatiently at the station?
193,THE PILLOW CASES,It's a bed he wants--any bed will do;
194,THE PILLOW CASES,"The quicker he gets it, the better for the song on the morrow."
195,THE PILLOW CASES,But in cooking the news for the public
196,THE PILLOW CASES,One a.m. is the same thing as noon day.
197,THE PILLOW CASES,So they rushed the star with these questions:
198,THE PILLOW CASES,"""Not conscripted yet?..."""
199,THE PILLOW CASES,"""How do you like this town?..."""
200,THE PILLOW CASES,"""Will you give any encores tomorrow?..."""
201,THE PILLOW CASES,"""When will the war end?..."""
202,THE PILLOW CASES,"Ruthlessly he plowed through them,"
203,THE PILLOW CASES,Like a British tank at Messines.
204,THE PILLOW CASES,"The tenor wanted a bed,"
205,THE PILLOW CASES,But Lesville wanted a story....
206,THE PILLOW CASES,"On the platform patiently nestled were twenty six pieces of luggage,"
207,THE PILLOW CASES,"Twenty six pieces of luggage, containing more than their content,"
208,THE PILLOW CASES,"Twenty six pieces of luggage would get him the story, he had not given himself."
209,THE PILLOW CASES,"Craftily, one lured the reporters to look on this bulging baggage,"
210,THE PILLOW CASES,"""Pillows and pillows and pillow...."" was whispered,"
211,THE PILLOW CASES,"""Tonight he will sleep on them."""
212,THE PILLOW CASES,"Vulture-like swooped down the porters,"
213,THE PILLOW CASES,Bearing them off to the taxis.
214,THE PILLOW CASES,Next morning the papers carried the story:
215,THE PILLOW CASES,"""Singer Transports His Own Bedding,"""
216,THE PILLOW CASES,But the artist slept soundly on Ostermoors that night.
217,THE PILLOW CASES,The baggage held scores for the orchestra.

221,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,
222,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"He was the head of a large real estate firm,"
223,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,And his avocation was seeking the good in a Better Industrial Relations Society.
224,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"They were going to have an exhibit in their church building,"
225,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,At which it was to be proved
226,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,That giving a gold watch for an invention
227,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,That made millions for the factory owner
228,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Was worthwhile.
229,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,But they needed a press agent
230,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,To let the world and themselves
231,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Know that what they were doing was good.
232,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,"I was chosen for the work,"
233,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,But the head of the large real estate firm
234,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Thought that half a column a day was too little
235,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,To record the fact that a cash register company
236,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,In which he owned stock
237,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Had presented a medal to an employee who had remained with them
238,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,At the same salary for fifteen years.
239,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,So he had me fired.
240,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,And the Better Industrial Relations Exhibit was a great success.
241,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,And many of the morning and evening newspapers
242,BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS,Ran editorials about it.

246,THE PRIMA DONNA,
247,THE PRIMA DONNA,"She had been interviewed at all possible times,--"
248,THE PRIMA DONNA,And sometimes the interviews came at impossible ones;
249,THE PRIMA DONNA,But it did not matter to her
250,THE PRIMA DONNA,As long as the stories were printed and her name was spelt correctly.
251,THE PRIMA DONNA,So we sent a photographer to the hotel one day
252,THE PRIMA DONNA,To take pictures of her in her drawing room.
253,THE PRIMA DONNA,He was an ungentle photographer
254,THE PRIMA DONNA,Who had been accustomed to take pictures of young women
255,THE PRIMA DONNA,"Coming into the harbor on shipboard, and no photograph was complete"
256,THE PRIMA DONNA,Without limbs being crossed or suchwise.
257,THE PRIMA DONNA,"But she did not mind even that,"
258,THE PRIMA DONNA,If the pictures were published the next day.
259,THE PRIMA DONNA,"He took a great number of her in her salon,"
260,THE PRIMA DONNA,And departed happy at the day's bagging.
261,THE PRIMA DONNA,A great international disturbance reduced all the white space available
262,THE PRIMA DONNA,And no photographs were printed the next day
263,THE PRIMA DONNA,Of the prima donna.
264,THE PRIMA DONNA,"And when I met her at rehearsal, she said very shortly:"
265,THE PRIMA DONNA,"""Je vous ne parle plus"" and looked at me harshly."
266,THE PRIMA DONNA,Was I to blame for the international situation?

273,PRESS STORIES,"I painstakingly pick out words on the typewriter,"
274,PRESS STORIES,"By fits and starts, thinking up a story about the great Metropolitan tenor."
275,PRESS STORIES,The typewriter keys now hold no rhythmic tingle.
276,PRESS STORIES,But the local manager in Iowa wants the story.
277,PRESS STORIES,He has engaged the great tenor for a date next March
278,PRESS STORIES,When the Tuesday musicale ladies give their annual benefit for the Shriners.
279,PRESS STORIES,"He wants the concert to be such a success,"
280,PRESS STORIES,That his Iowan town will henceforth be in the foreground
281,PRESS STORIES,"Of Iowan towns, as far as music is concerned."
282,PRESS STORIES,"So he has wired in for this tale about the singer,"
283,PRESS STORIES,"A story about his wife and baby, and what the baby eats per diem."
284,PRESS STORIES,"And though the call is to the street below,"
285,PRESS STORIES,"Where jubilant masses proclaim the holiday,"
286,PRESS STORIES,I must finish the story about the tenor's wife and baby
287,PRESS STORIES,"To put the Iowan town in the foreground, as far as music is concerned."

292,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,The Irish prize play had come back to Broadway.
293,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Where to put the credit? On the astute manager
294,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Who saw in it
295,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,"A year of Broadway, two of stock, eternity in the movies;"
296,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Or the League of Public Spirited Women
297,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Banded together to uplift the Drama--
298,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,That was the question stirring dramatic circles and the public.
299,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,It had failed in its first run of three weeks at an uptown theatre
300,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,"Miserably,"
301,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Despite glowing reviews in all the dailies.
302,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,But this come-back
303,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,"At a Broadway theatre, with electric lights, and transient crowds"
304,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,That would save it--
305,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Was the universal verdict.
306,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,During the first week there was a tremendous fight
307,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,Between the two factions for the
308,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,"Distribution of credit, and some critics said"
309,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,The League of Public Spirited Women was responsible
310,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,"For bringing the play back, because they had bulletined it,"
311,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,And others said it was the astute manager.
312,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,But no audience came to the play after the second week.
313,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,And it went to the storehouse.
314,THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT,No one fought any longer for

331,TEARS,This was her charity:

334,TEARS,She received no response from the American public.

358,PHOTOGRAPHS,"The telephone bell rings and awakens me from my reveries,--"
359,PHOTOGRAPHS,It is the voice of the beautiful prima donna herself;
360,PHOTOGRAPHS,But the melodious notes the critics have praised are changed.
361,PHOTOGRAPHS,"There is a raucous, strident tone in the voice;"
362,PHOTOGRAPHS,It sounds like the rasping bark of the harpies.
363,PHOTOGRAPHS,"""How dare you use those terrible photographs?"""
364,PHOTOGRAPHS,"""What do you mean by insulting my beauty?"""

869,GEORGE M. COHAN,"He fattened his average,"
870,GEORGE M. COHAN,Batting four hundred
871,GEORGE M. COHAN,"By taking a kindred irreverent soul,"
872,GEORGE M. COHAN,Graduated out of the whirlpool
873,GEORGE M. COHAN,"That wrecks all but the strongest,"
874,GEORGE M. COHAN,Born on the eastern edge
875,GEORGE M. COHAN,"Of Manhattan,"
876,GEORGE M. COHAN,"Sam H. Harris, man of business,"
877,GEORGE M. COHAN,Who to the skill of the trader
878,GEORGE M. COHAN,Adds the joy in life
879,GEORGE M. COHAN,"And the sense of humor,"
880,GEORGE M. COHAN,Coupled with pleasure in giving
881,GEORGE M. COHAN,And helping
882,GEORGE M. COHAN,That Cohan demands of his pals.
883,GEORGE M. COHAN,"Together they plan wonderful projects,"
884,GEORGE M. COHAN,And the artist soul
885,GEORGE M. COHAN,And the soul of commerce
886,GEORGE M. COHAN,Are an unbeatable union.
887,GEORGE M. COHAN,Best of all about Cohan
888,GEORGE M. COHAN,Is his congenital manliness.
889,GEORGE M. COHAN,He sees Americans
890,GEORGE M. COHAN,As our soil and our air and our water
891,GEORGE M. COHAN,Have made them;
892,GEORGE M. COHAN,Types as distinct as the Indian.
893,GEORGE M. COHAN,"He follows no school,"
894,GEORGE M. COHAN,Knows little of movements artistic.
895,GEORGE M. COHAN,"A lonely creator,"
896,GEORGE M. COHAN,"His friends are not writing men,"
897,GEORGE M. COHAN,"Reformers, uplifters or zealots."
898,GEORGE M. COHAN,He writes the life he has lived
899,GEORGE M. COHAN,"So fully and zestfully,"
900,GEORGE M. COHAN,And over it all plays like sheet lightning
901,GEORGE M. COHAN,A beneficent humor.
902,GEORGE M. COHAN,"Growth is his hall-mark,"
903,GEORGE M. COHAN,Hard work his chief recreation;
904,GEORGE M. COHAN,Not Balzac could toil with labor titanic
905,GEORGE M. COHAN,More terribly.
906,GEORGE M. COHAN,"George M. Cohan,"
907,GEORGE M. COHAN,Excelling in everything--

914,DAVID BELASCO,King David of old slew the Philistines;
915,DAVID BELASCO,Our David has made them admirers and patrons;
916,DAVID BELASCO,He has numbered the people
917,DAVID BELASCO,Night after night in his theatres.
918,DAVID BELASCO,"Will he ever, I wonder, send forth for the Shunammite?"
919,DAVID BELASCO,"Many there be who would answer his calling,"
920,DAVID BELASCO,For he has shown ambitious fair women
921,DAVID BELASCO,To acting's high places.
922,DAVID BELASCO,As Rodin in marble saw wondrous creations
923,DAVID BELASCO,"To be freed by the chisel,"
924,DAVID BELASCO,So Belasco in immature genius and beauty
925,DAVID BELASCO,Sees the resplendent star to be kindled
926,DAVID BELASCO,At his own steady beacon.
927,DAVID BELASCO,"Too varied a mind for our comprehension,"
928,DAVID BELASCO,Too big and too broad and too subtle
929,DAVID BELASCO,To be understood of the bourgeois American
930,DAVID BELASCO,Whom he has led decade after decade
931,DAVID BELASCO,By a nose ring artistic.
932,DAVID BELASCO,"Capable of everything, he has worked"
933,DAVID BELASCO,"With the ease of a master, giving the public"
934,DAVID BELASCO,"Marvelous detail, unfailing sensation and poses pictorial;"
935,DAVID BELASCO,Preferring the certain success to arduous striving
936,DAVID BELASCO,For the more excellent things of the future.
937,DAVID BELASCO,"Like David his forebear, a king but no prophet,"
938,DAVID BELASCO,Amazingly wise in his own generation.
939,DAVID BELASCO,"A wizard in art of the everyday,"
940,DAVID BELASCO,"Lord of the spotlight and dimmer,"
941,DAVID BELASCO,"But nursing the unconquerable hope, the inviolable shade"
942,DAVID BELASCO,Of what in his dreams Oriental
943,DAVID BELASCO,"He fain would do, did not necessity drive him."
944,DAVID BELASCO,His the fascination of a great personality.
945,DAVID BELASCO,Who knoweth not him of the clerical collar?
946,DAVID BELASCO,"Hair of the sage and eyes of the poet,"
947,DAVID BELASCO,Features perfectly drawn and as mobile
948,DAVID BELASCO,As those of the inspired actor;
949,DAVID BELASCO,With speech so much blander than honey
950,DAVID BELASCO,And insight that maketh his staged stumbling in bargains
951,DAVID BELASCO,Cover the shrewdness of a masterly trader.
952,DAVID BELASCO,"None better than he knoweth the crowd and its likings,"
953,DAVID BELASCO,"As to using the patter of drama artistic,"
954,DAVID BELASCO,That's where he lives.
955,DAVID BELASCO,With incense and color and scenery
956,DAVID BELASCO,He refilleth the bottle of art so that the contents
957,DAVID BELASCO,Go twice better than in the original package.
958,DAVID BELASCO,Thanks be to David for joy in the playhouse.
959,DAVID BELASCO,"Wizard, magician, necromancer of switchboards,"
960,DAVID BELASCO,"He hath woven spells from the actual,"
961,DAVID BELASCO,Keeping ideals and ideas well in the background.
962,DAVID BELASCO,"Like Gautier, these things delight him:"
963,DAVID BELASCO,"Gold, marble and purple; brilliance, solidity, color."
964,DAVID BELASCO,He can stage Tiffany's jewels but not Maeterlinck's bees.
965,DAVID BELASCO,Deep in his soul there are tempests
966,DAVID BELASCO,Revealed in the storms of his dramas--
967,DAVID BELASCO,"Sandstorm and snowstorm, rainstorm and hurricane."
968,DAVID BELASCO,That nature revealed in its subtle reactions
969,DAVID BELASCO,Would show in its deeps the soul of an Angelo
970,DAVID BELASCO,Subdued to success and dyed by democracy.
971,DAVID BELASCO,Opportunism hath made him
972,DAVID BELASCO,An artistic materialist.
973,DAVID BELASCO,"One work remains for David Belasco,"
974,DAVID BELASCO,And that is to stage with patient precision
975,DAVID BELASCO,"A cross section in drama of his own self-surprising,"
976,DAVID BELASCO,Making the world sit up and take notice
977,DAVID BELASCO,"With what ""masterly detail,"" ""unfailing atmosphere,"""

1050,THE SCREEN,"I stand in shadow,"
1051,THE SCREEN,"Just a splotch of white,"
1052,THE SCREEN,Unnoted by the cleaning crew
1053,THE SCREEN,Who've spent their hours of toil
1054,THE SCREEN,That I might live again.
1055,THE SCREEN,"Yet they hold no reverence for my charms,"
1056,THE SCREEN,And if they pause amid their work
1057,THE SCREEN,They do not glance at me;
1058,THE SCREEN,"All their admiration, all their awe,"
1059,THE SCREEN,Is for the gold and scarlet trappings of the home
1060,THE SCREEN,That's built to house my wonders;
1061,THE SCREEN,"Or for the gorgeous murals all around,"
1062,THE SCREEN,"Which really, after all,"
1063,THE SCREEN,"Were put in place as most lame substitutes,"
1064,THE SCREEN,Striving to soothe the patron's ire
1065,THE SCREEN,For those few moments when my face is dark.
1066,THE SCREEN,"Yes, men have built a palace sheltering me,"
1067,THE SCREEN,And as the endless ocean washes on its stretch of beach
1068,THE SCREEN,The tides of people flow to me.
1069,THE SCREEN,
1070,THE SCREEN,All things I am to everyone;
1071,THE SCREEN,"The newsboys, shopgirls,"

1073,THE SCREEN,"Who've clutched at life and missed,"
1074,THE SCREEN,"See in my magic face,"
1075,THE SCREEN,"The lowly rise to fame and palaces,"
1076,THE SCREEN,See virtue triumph every time
1077,THE SCREEN,And rich and wicked justly flayed.

1085,THE SCREEN,Who seem aloof but inwardly are fond of me
1086,THE SCREEN,Because I've caught the gracious beauty of their pets.
1087,THE SCREEN,Then some there are who watch my changing face

1089,THE SCREEN,As it falls from day to day.

1144,MATINEE,"The air is pungent with the mixed perfumes,"

1150,MATINEE,
1151,MATINEE,The play is on.

1153,MATINEE,There is a hastening of the beat

1157,MATINEE,From waiting eyes;

1160,MATINEE,"The playwright's puppet has to woo,"

1168,MATINEE,Implants the kiss.
1169,MATINEE,
1170,MATINEE,And then against his heaving breast
1171,MATINEE,The hero feels the beatings of six hundred hearts
1172,MATINEE,"In mighty unison,"
1173,MATINEE,And on his lips there is the pulse

1175,MATINEE,Returned six-hundred fold.

1179,PAVLOWA,
1180,PAVLOWA,I was working on _The Daily News_
1181,PAVLOWA,"When I first heard of her,"
1182,PAVLOWA,And from that time
1183,PAVLOWA,Until the day she came to town
1184,PAVLOWA,I longed to see her dance.
1185,PAVLOWA,The night the dancer and her ballet came
1186,PAVLOWA,The Desk assigned me to my nightly run
1187,PAVLOWA,"Of hotels, clubs, and undertakers' shops;"
1188,PAVLOWA,I was so green
1189,PAVLOWA,I had not learned
1190,PAVLOWA,The art of using telephones
1191,PAVLOWA,To make it seem
1192,PAVLOWA,That I was hot upon the trail of news
1193,PAVLOWA,While loafing otherwhere.
1194,PAVLOWA,How could I do my trick
1195,PAVLOWA,And also see her dance?
1196,PAVLOWA,"So I left bread and butter flat,"
1197,PAVLOWA,"To feast my eyes, which had been prairie-fed,"
1198,PAVLOWA,Upon this vision from another world.
1199,PAVLOWA,
1200,PAVLOWA,I'd seen the wind
1201,PAVLOWA,Go rippling over seas of wheat;
1202,PAVLOWA,I'd stood at night within a wood
1203,PAVLOWA,And felt the pulse of growing things
1204,PAVLOWA,Upon the April air;
1205,PAVLOWA,I'd seen the hawks arise and soar;
1206,PAVLOWA,And dragon-flies
1207,PAVLOWA,At sunrise over misty pools--
1208,PAVLOWA,But all these things had never known a name
1209,PAVLOWA,Until I saw Pavlowa dance.
1210,PAVLOWA,
1211,PAVLOWA,Next day the editor explained
1212,PAVLOWA,"That although art was--art,"
1213,PAVLOWA,He'd found a boy to take my place.
1214,PAVLOWA,The days that followed
1215,PAVLOWA,When I walked the town
1216,PAVLOWA,"Seeking for some sort of work,"
1217,PAVLOWA,The haze of Indian Summer
1218,PAVLOWA,Blended with the dream
1219,PAVLOWA,Of that one night's magic.
1220,PAVLOWA,And though I needed work to keep alive
1221,PAVLOWA,My thoughts would go no further
1222,PAVLOWA,Than Pavlowa as the maid Giselle ...
1223,PAVLOWA,"Then cold days came,"
1224,PAVLOWA,And found the dream a fabric much too thin;
1225,PAVLOWA,"And finally a job,"
1226,PAVLOWA,And I was back to stomach fare.
1227,PAVLOWA,
1228,PAVLOWA,But through the years
1229,PAVLOWA,"I've nursed the sacrifice,"
1230,PAVLOWA,Counting it a tribute
1231,PAVLOWA,Unlike all the things
1232,PAVLOWA,That Kings and Queens have laid before her feet;
1233,PAVLOWA,And wishing somehow she might know
1234,PAVLOWA,About the price
1235,PAVLOWA,The cub reporter paid
1236,PAVLOWA,To see Pavlowa dance.
1237,PAVLOWA,
1238,PAVLOWA,"And then by trick of time,"
1239,PAVLOWA,We came together at the Hippodrome;
1240,PAVLOWA,And every day I saw her dance.
1241,PAVLOWA,One morning in the darkened wings
1242,PAVLOWA,I saw a big-eyed woman in a filmy thing
1243,PAVLOWA,Go through the exercises
1244,PAVLOWA,Athletes use when training for a team;
1245,PAVLOWA,And from a stage-hand learned
1246,PAVLOWA,"That this Pavlowa, incomparable one,"
1247,PAVLOWA,Out of every day spent hours
1248,PAVLOWA,On elementary practice steps.
1249,PAVLOWA,And now somehow
1250,PAVLOWA,I can not find the heart
1251,PAVLOWA,To tell Pavlowa of the price I paid
1252,PAVLOWA,To see her dance.

1287,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"I was Christian, that is white and Infidel,"
1288,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,So old Abdullah took me in his tent
1289,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,And stripping off my white man's clothes
1290,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Painted me with dye made from the chestnut hulls,"
1291,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Laughing the while about the potency of juice
1292,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,That would prove armour 'gainst some zealot's scimitar.
1293,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Four camels made our caravan
1294,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"And these we also used for ""props."""
1295,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,When we played a Morocco town
1296,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,The chieftain met us at the hamlet's edge
1297,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Asked of Abdullah what his mission there,"
1298,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Then let us enter
1299,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"He leading our caravan to the chieftain's hut,"
1300,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Where we sat upon the sand
1301,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,The thirty odd of us
1302,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Surrounded by as many lesser chiefs.
1303,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,The hookah solemnly was passed around
1304,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,And then the hamlet chief would speak;
1305,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"""Stranger, why have you forsaken home"
1306,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"And drawn believers after you,"
1307,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"You bear no spices, oil, or woven cloth,"
1308,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"No jewels nor any merchantry?"""
1309,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1310,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,And then Abdullah:
1311,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"""True, Allah's precious son,"
1312,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,We trade in naught men feed their bellies on
1313,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"But we have wares to thrill brave men,"
1314,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"To make your youth see what use bodies are,"
1315,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,To make your women blush
1316,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"That they have no such men."""
1317,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1318,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"""What are these magic wares?"""
1319,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1320,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"""Why we have here an Arab youth"
1321,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Who seems possessed of wings,"
1322,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Jumping three camels in a row."""
1323,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1324,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"""So! In this very village there's a lad"
1325,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Who jumps four camels
1326,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"With half the wind it takes you, telling of your boy."""
1327,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1328,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Scoff followed boast and back again
1329,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Until the chief arose,"
1330,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Saying to the lesser chiefs
1331,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,That they should call the local tribe
1332,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,To meet beside the caravanserai
1333,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Before another sun went down
1334,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,To see if these vain wandering men
1335,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Could do one half the deeds they boasted.
1336,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1337,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"So we met at sundown,"
1338,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Our brown men stripped
1339,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Except for linen clouts.
1340,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"We tumbled, jumped, made human pyramids,"
1341,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,And whirled as only Dervish whirl.
1342,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1343,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Then as a climax the village boy essayed
1344,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,To span the four trained camels
1345,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Who at Abdullah's soft-spoke word
1346,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Moved just enough apart to make the boy fall short.
1347,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"And then our sinewed lad would make the leap,"
1348,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,The camels crowding close together
1349,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,At another soft command.
1350,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Our lad making good his jump,"
1351,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,The populace would grant our greater skill;
1352,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"A goatskin filled with wine,"
1353,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,And honey mixed with melted butter
1354,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Was offered us within the caravanserai.
1355,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Then we moved out beyond the town
1356,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"And pitched our tents of camels' hair,"
1357,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Rising before the sun to face the friendless desert wastes
1358,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Until we reached another habitation on the camel trail,"
1359,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,I (who played the dumb boy of the tribe
1360,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Lest my Christian tongue betray me)
1361,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Trudging behind with all the salary--
1362,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Chasing the desert after two new sheep,"
1363,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Our net receipts for that Moroccan one-night stand.
1364,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1365,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Now twice each day within the Hippodrome
1366,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"I, a buffoon in absurd clothes,"
1367,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Strive to make the thousands laugh;
1368,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,And when my act is done
1369,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"There comes the tread of camels' feet,"
1370,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Followed by Slayman Ali and his Arab troupe,"
1371,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Who tumble, jump and build pyramids"
1372,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Before a canvas Sphinx upon a painted desert....
1373,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,When I saw Slayman last
1374,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,He was a boy
1375,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Chasing the sheep with me
1376,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,Beneath Morocco's moon.
1377,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"Tell me, where dwells romance, anyway?"
1378,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,"In Manhattan, or Arabian, nights?"
1379,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1380,BLUCH LANDOLF'S TALE,
1381,PRE-EMINENCE,PRE-EMINENCE
1382,PRE-EMINENCE,
1383,PRE-EMINENCE,I once knew a man
1384,PRE-EMINENCE,"Who'd met Duse,"
1385,PRE-EMINENCE,(Or so he said)
1386,PRE-EMINENCE,And talked with her;
1387,PRE-EMINENCE,As she came down a windy street
1388,PRE-EMINENCE,He turned a corner
1389,PRE-EMINENCE,Headlong into her.
1390,PRE-EMINENCE,"""I am so sorry,"" Duse said,"
1391,PRE-EMINENCE,"""I was looking at the stars."""
1392,PRE-EMINENCE,
1393,PRE-EMINENCE,My envy of that man
1394,PRE-EMINENCE,Withstood the years
1395,PRE-EMINENCE,Until one day I met a Dane
1396,PRE-EMINENCE,Who'd talked with Henrik Ibsen:
1397,PRE-EMINENCE,"This man, with head bowed to the wind,"
1398,PRE-EMINENCE,Was walking up a Stockholm way
1399,PRE-EMINENCE,"When 'round the corner came the seer,"
1400,PRE-EMINENCE,And he plumped into him.
1401,PRE-EMINENCE,And that great mind
1402,PRE-EMINENCE,Whose thinking moved the world
1403,PRE-EMINENCE,Surveyed my friend
1404,PRE-EMINENCE,Through his big eyes
1405,PRE-EMINENCE,And slowly spoke:
1406,PRE-EMINENCE,"""Since when have codfish come to land?"""
1407,PRE-EMINENCE,
1408,PRE-EMINENCE,With all the awe
1409,PRE-EMINENCE,"One has for those who've known the great,"
1410,PRE-EMINENCE,These two I've envied
1411,PRE-EMINENCE,Until the other day
1412,PRE-EMINENCE,When blundering 'round behind the scenes
1413,PRE-EMINENCE,I stepped upon Pavlowa's toe.
1414,PRE-EMINENCE,
1415,PRE-EMINENCE,
1416,PRE-EMINENCE,
1417,PRE-EMINENCE,
1418,PRE-EMINENCE,
1419,PRE-EMINENCE,
1420,PRE-EMINENCE,
