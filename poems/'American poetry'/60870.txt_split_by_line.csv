148,THE RACE OF THE MIGHTY,
149,THE RACE OF THE MIGHTY,
150,THE RACE OF THE MIGHTY,The Race of the Mighty[A]
151,THE RACE OF THE MIGHTY,
152,THE START,THE START
153,THE START,
154,THE START,The appointed time at length the dials show.
155,THE START,"“Attention, both!... Now, are you ready?... Go!!”"
156,THE START,The chauffeur grips his lever with a hand
157,THE START,Of steel.--A leap!--A flash of wheels! A grand
158,THE START,And supple beast-like spring!--A growl of gear!
159,THE START,"As, sweeping through the multitudinous sea"
160,THE START,"Of men upraising full-voiced cheer on cheer,"
161,THE START,He whirls away to promised victory!...
162,THE START,
163,ON THE ROAD,ON THE ROAD
164,ON THE ROAD,
165,ON THE ROAD,The high road stretches straight and white
166,ON THE ROAD,Away
167,ON THE ROAD,"To dreamy distance, on and on--"
168,ON THE ROAD,The day
169,ON THE ROAD,Dawns sharp and foggy; nips the driver’s
170,ON THE ROAD,"Nose,"
171,ON THE ROAD,Despite his costly furs. Zounds! How
172,ON THE ROAD,It blows!
173,ON THE ROAD,The motor purrs!--Our mobile seems
174,ON THE ROAD,"To fly,"
175,ON THE ROAD,Nor touch the ground... (Pneumatic
176,ON THE ROAD,Mystery!)
177,ON THE ROAD,"The motor purrs!--Farewell wood, field"
178,ON THE ROAD,And stream!
179,ON THE ROAD,"Once on the road, we’ve scanty time"
180,ON THE ROAD,To dream!
181,ON THE ROAD,The motor purrs!--Look out! A sheer
182,ON THE ROAD,Decline.
183,ON THE ROAD,Temptation whispers: Faster here!
184,ON THE ROAD,It’s fine!
185,ON THE ROAD,"Faster? It’s madness! Yes, I know!--"
186,ON THE ROAD,But on!
187,ON THE ROAD,Full speed down hill! Another record
188,ON THE ROAD,Gone!...
189,ON THE ROAD,The driver plunges out of view...
190,ON THE ROAD,"See, there"
191,ON THE ROAD,He climbs the distant slope again.
192,ON THE ROAD,I swear
193,ON THE ROAD,He’d scale Olympus! Yet that course
194,ON THE ROAD,Is clear
195,ON THE ROAD,From many mishaps that beset
196,ON THE ROAD,Us here!
197,ON THE ROAD,We crush a curséd mongrel in
198,ON THE ROAD,The dust!
199,ON THE ROAD,"Slow down to miss an English spinster,"
200,ON THE ROAD,Just
201,ON THE ROAD,"Graze by her on her clumsy, ancient"
202,ON THE ROAD,Wheel!--
203,ON THE ROAD,"Rout ducks and chickens, set the pigs"
204,ON THE ROAD,A-squeal!
205,ON THE ROAD,It’s not _our_ fault! We can’t be kept
206,ON THE ROAD,All day
207,ON THE ROAD,To clear the road!... Speed on!--Away!
208,ON THE ROAD,Away!...
209,ON THE ROAD,
210,THE STRUGGLE,THE STRUGGLE
211,THE STRUGGLE,
212,THE STRUGGLE,"But hark!... Behind, a trumpet-blast winds clear!"
213,THE STRUGGLE,Great God! Our dread competitor draws near;
214,THE STRUGGLE,"We’d half a minute start, and now, like Fate,"
215,THE STRUGGLE,He’s rushing onward to annihilate
216,THE STRUGGLE,"Distance and time, whirled in a hurricane!"
217,THE STRUGGLE,Inexorably we see him gain and gain....
218,THE STRUGGLE,
219,THE STRUGGLE,“Now!--speed her up!” the boy cries out. “More speed!”
220,THE STRUGGLE,"“The curséd motor’s gone to sleep!--Indeed,"
221,THE STRUGGLE,“We’re hardly doing fifty miles an hour.
222,THE STRUGGLE,“But he won’t pass us yet awhile! More power!”...
223,THE STRUGGLE,The driver heeds; he moves--the furious pace
224,THE STRUGGLE,"Grows frenzied! Oh, the glory of a race"
225,THE STRUGGLE,"Like this of modern days, with steady hand"
226,THE STRUGGLE,To steer a whirlwind through a startled land!
227,THE STRUGGLE,
228,THE WATCHERS,THE WATCHERS
229,THE WATCHERS,
230,THE WATCHERS,“The first is near!--Let no one cross!--Take care!
231,THE WATCHERS,“See! There they are!--Look out! The horn! Beware!
232,THE WATCHERS,"“Stand back!--They’re two!... It’s Girardot! No, no;"
233,THE WATCHERS,"“It’s Charron! No, it’s Levegh!--How they blow"
234,THE WATCHERS,“That horn!”... But who can hope to recognize
235,THE WATCHERS,Or name the shrilling bullet in its flight?
236,THE WATCHERS,And what are names when glory blinds the eyes?
237,THE WATCHERS,"The towns love sport, and cheer; but, half in fright"
238,THE WATCHERS,The laboring peasants stop their ploughs to see
239,THE WATCHERS,This avalanche--this hurtling mystery!
240,THE WATCHERS,
241,THE FINISH,THE FINISH
242,THE FINISH,
243,THE FINISH,"Untiring, on their mounts of fire and steel,"
244,THE FINISH,"The shielded chauffeurs, watchful, hand on wheel,"
245,THE FINISH,Have flashed through many a league;--have breathed the dust
246,THE FINISH,Of devious ways; have skirted wood and sea;
247,THE FINISH,"Have traversed towns, crossed rivers, hills and dales;--"
248,THE FINISH,Nor halted once! To learn geography
249,THE FINISH,"By such vast lessons, though it tire the flesh,"
250,THE FINISH,Exalts the soul and makes the spirit free.
251,THE FINISH,"But now must end this vast, Titanic race!"
252,THE FINISH,(It cannot last forever!)--See! The place
253,THE FINISH,"Lies there!... A broad, white banner bars the way,"
254,THE FINISH,Between two lofty poles with streamers gay.
255,THE FINISH,The “FINISH” there we read. The end at last!
256,THE FINISH,"All rest and glory, once that goal is passed!"
257,THE FINISH,A final burst!--The driver grips the bar!
258,THE FINISH,The “FINISH!” In the road he sees afar
259,THE FINISH,"A judge with solemn air attentive stand,"
260,THE FINISH,Waving a crimson kerchief in his hand...
261,THE FINISH,“Stop!” Harshly grinds the brake--“What number’s this?”
262,THE FINISH,“Your name?”
263,THE FINISH,Recorded!
264,THE FINISH,Apotheosis!!
265,THE FINISH,
266,THE FINISH,

272,SONGS & SONNETS,Love Beatified.
273,SONGS & SONNETS,
274,SONGS & SONNETS,"Love, slain by us and buried yesterday,"
275,SONGS & SONNETS,"Rose up again, nor in his grave would stay."
276,SONGS & SONNETS,
277,SONGS & SONNETS,On his earth-stainèd brow and sightless eyes
278,SONGS & SONNETS,Still shone the splendours of our Paradise.
279,SONGS & SONNETS,
280,SONGS & SONNETS,"Hushed was each dissonance, every fault made clean,"
281,SONGS & SONNETS,"And joys alone I saw, that might have been."
282,SONGS & SONNETS,
283,SONGS & SONNETS,It never seemed our Love could shew so fair
284,SONGS & SONNETS,"As that dead Presence, shrined in glory there."
285,SONGS & SONNETS,
286,SONGS & SONNETS,"I would not have our Love to live again,"
287,SONGS & SONNETS,And blend each pleasure with his greater pain.--
288,SONGS & SONNETS,
289,SONGS & SONNETS,"Oh better far this blessèd death, and rest!"
290,SONGS & SONNETS,"Dead Love I clasp, I cherish to my breast"

292,SONGS & SONNETS,
293,SONGS & SONNETS,
294,SONGS & SONNETS,"Morning, Noon and Night."
295,SONGS & SONNETS,
296,SONGS & SONNETS,I love thee when the gates of eastern light
297,SONGS & SONNETS,"Are opened by the Morning-star, aflame;"
298,SONGS & SONNETS,I love thee when the rose-red heavens proclaim
299,SONGS & SONNETS,"The coming of their lord, to mortal sight,"
300,SONGS & SONNETS,"And cloudless, when from his imperial height"
301,SONGS & SONNETS,He looks in glory down. I breathe thy name
302,SONGS & SONNETS,"With thoughts of love, when drowsy Noon the same"
303,SONGS & SONNETS,"Poised, equal distance holds, twixt dawn and night."
304,SONGS & SONNETS,
305,SONGS & SONNETS,"I love thee when the West begins to glow,"
306,SONGS & SONNETS,And when the restless winds lie still in heaven;
307,SONGS & SONNETS,"I love thee when the deep’ning shadows fall,"
308,SONGS & SONNETS,"As comes with Tyrian dye, soft, purple even;"
309,SONGS & SONNETS,"But when, from out the waters, rises slow"
310,SONGS & SONNETS,"The noiseless Night, I love thee best of all."

314,SONGS & SONNETS,
315,SONGS & SONNETS,"Thou’rt but a pensive, dreaming Boy, when first"
316,SONGS & SONNETS,To thy sad eyne the sight of Love appears
317,SONGS & SONNETS,With blessèd Beatrice. Nine circling years
318,SONGS & SONNETS,"Name thee the wounded Lover, whose sweet thirst"
319,SONGS & SONNETS,"Is never sated, nor whose fever less."
320,SONGS & SONNETS,At Campaldino thou’rt the mailèd Knight;
321,SONGS & SONNETS,Savage to spur thy City on toward right
322,SONGS & SONNETS,"Thou’rt driven, its scape-goat, to the wilderness."
323,SONGS & SONNETS,
324,SONGS & SONNETS,"There, in the stranger’s house whose stairs are pain"
325,SONGS & SONNETS,"To mount, whose bread is bitter to thy mouth,"
326,SONGS & SONNETS,"Dawns thy Great Vision, mid thy soul’s last drouth;"
327,SONGS & SONNETS,"And, past Hell’s flame and Purgatory’s round,"
328,SONGS & SONNETS,"Greets thee thy love most gentle, once again,"
329,SONGS & SONNETS,Thou frowning Florentine with laurels crowned!
330,SONGS & SONNETS,

332,SONGS & SONNETS,Love’s Blindness.
333,SONGS & SONNETS,
334,SONGS & SONNETS,"“O Love, my Love, thou canst not know how sweet,"
335,SONGS & SONNETS,"How dear thou art!”--“Naught would I know, save this"
336,SONGS & SONNETS,That thou wilt ever yearn to share my kiss!
337,SONGS & SONNETS,"So being, I reck not whether years be fleet"
338,SONGS & SONNETS,Or endless!”--“But thou canst not see thy face
339,SONGS & SONNETS,As others see thee! Thy deep eyes that greet
340,SONGS & SONNETS,"Their lucent-mirrored glimmerings, melt and meet"
341,SONGS & SONNETS,"In glory there, to blind themselves a space!”"
342,SONGS & SONNETS,
343,SONGS & SONNETS,"“Hush, O my heart! Thy vain hyperbole"
344,SONGS & SONNETS,Means naught; but take in both thy hands and turn
345,SONGS & SONNETS,"To thee this face of mine, and kiss my brow,"
346,SONGS & SONNETS,And after that mine eyes which cannot see
347,SONGS & SONNETS,"But only feel thy lips that thrill, and now"
348,SONGS & SONNETS,"My mouth, and now--O God! thy kisses burn!”"

359,I,Rise up to toil another day.
360,I,"Down flares the heat on town and street,"
361,I,"Wide-warping pillar, span and plinth;"
362,I,"Once more my burning, wearied eyes"
363,I,Within this monstrous labyrinth
364,I,"Meet the mad heat that stifles me,"

367,I,To thee!... To thee!...

371,II,My pavement-wearied feet again
372,II,"Tread the rough streets whose ways are pain,"
373,II,"Hot with the sun’s last sullen beam,"
374,II,And yet--I dream!
375,II,"Dream when I wake, and at high, blinding Noon,"
376,II,Or when the moon
377,II,Mocks the sad City in her sullen night
378,II,That burns too bright!
379,II,So sweet my visions seem
380,II,"That from this sordid smoke and dust I turn,"
381,II,Turn where the dim Wood-world calls out to me
382,II,And where the forest-virgins I half see
383,II,With green mysterious fingers beckoning!
384,II,"Where vine-wreathed woodland altars sunlit burn,"
385,II,"Or Dryads weave their mystic rounds and sing,"
386,II,"Sing high, sing low, with magic cadences"
387,II,That once the wild oaks of Dodona heard;
388,II,And every wood-note bids me burst asunder
389,II,The bonds that hold me from the leaf-hid bird!
390,II,"I quaff thee, O Nepenthe! Ah, the wonder"
391,II,"Grows that there be who scorn not wealth and ease,"
392,II,"Who still will choose the street-life, rough and blurred,"
393,II,"Who will not quest you, O Hesperides!..."

395,III,III
396,III,
397,III,"And now, and now... I feel the forest-moss!"
398,III,"O, on these moss-beds let me lie with Pan,"
399,III,Twined with the ivy-vine in tendrilled curls!
400,III,And I will hold all gold that hampers man
401,III,But the base ashes of a barren dross!
402,III,On with the love-dance of the pagan girls!
403,III,"The pagan girls with lips all rosy-red,"
404,III,With breasts up-girt and foreheads garlanded!
405,III,With fair white foreheads nobly garlanded!
406,III,With sandalled feet that weave the magic ring
407,III,"Now ... let them sing,"
408,III,"And I will pipe a song that all may hear,"
409,III,To bid them mind the time of my wild rhyme!
410,III,Away! Away! Beware our mystic trees!

413,IV,IV
414,IV,
415,IV,"Great men of song, what sing ye? Woodland meadows?"
416,IV,"Rocks, trees and rills where sunlight glints to gold?"
417,IV,Sing ye the hills adown whose sides blue shadows
418,IV,Creep when the westering day is growing old?
419,IV,Sing ye the brooks where in the purling shallows
420,IV,The small fish dart and gleam?
421,IV,Sing ye the pale green tresses of the willows
422,IV,That stoop to kiss the stream?
423,IV,
424,IV,Or sing ye burning streets and sweating toil
425,IV,"Where we spawned swarms of men, unendingly,"
426,IV,"Above, below, in mart and workshop’s moil"
427,IV,"Have quite forgot thee, O mine Arcady?..."

438,IV,Of such frail flowers. Let aye the world consume
439,IV,Itself with toil and labour--such are all

504,IV,With each dark surge of long-pent enmity.
505,IV,
506,IV,"On through sea’s salty wastes the tempests spurn,"

640,I,
641,I,There lies a City of Unnumbered Dead
642,I,"Where paths entwine, where hills and valleys be,"
643,I,"And still, black pools; the cypress mystically"
644,I,Shrouds those dark ways. There living souls may tread
645,I,"With but slow steps and rare. With slow steps, led"
646,I,"By Love two lovers passed; they spake, and she"
647,I,Cast down her mystic eyes lest he might see
648,I,In their vague depths the image of her dread.
649,I,
650,I,A great round-tower of granite crowns that land.
651,I,"Thither they came, and now her starry eyes"
652,I,Were raised to his; that dread which wrought them ill
653,I,Behind them with the frozen dead lay chill.
654,I,Up the enchanted stairway hand in hand
655,I,"They passed, and issued forth to see the skies."
656,I,
657,II,II
658,II,
659,II,And yet their sweetest moment did not seem
660,II,"That dizzying issue into tenuous light,"
661,II,Where the keen salt-sea wind that lashed their height
662,II,Drowned their love-quickened breath as in a stream
663,II,"Of chill, on-rushing æther; not the gleam"
664,II,"Of multitudinous Ocean, nor the bright"
665,II,Expanse of Earth could draw their dazzled sight
666,II,From the new glory of their passionate dream.
667,II,
668,II,It was upon the tower’s midmost stair
669,II,At one dim diamond-window; both beguiled
670,II,Paused in the gloom; she trembled like a child;
671,II,"His hot mouth found her mouth, her gold-twined hair,"
672,II,And in her milk-white breast her heart beat wild
673,II,Beneath one burning kiss he printed there.
674,II,
675,II,
676,II,Love’s Prayer.
677,II,
678,II,When thy ripe lips in kisses mould to meet
679,II,Mine eager mouth--when thy full pulsing throat
680,II,Throbs with thy quickening life-breath--when the float
681,II,"And tangle of thine ungirt hair, oh Sweet,"
682,II,"Entwines us, breast to breast, the perfumed heat"
683,II,"Of each wild sigh fans all my face aflame,"
684,II,And beat to beat our passionate hearts the same
685,II,"Responses cry, as we Love’s creed repeat."
686,II,
687,II,"When in each other’s arms, love-wearied, we"
688,II,Both nested safe in silken cushions warm
689,II,
690,II,"At Winter-evenfall entrancèd lie,"
691,II,"Kissing but closer as we list the storm,"

704,II,"Oh France, be thou my love, my praise"
705,II,Always!
706,II,
707,II,Our mother--hath thy memory flown?--
708,II,Beside our humble chimney-stone
709,II,"Pressed us against her heart, whilst you,"
710,II,"Dear one,"
711,II,"And I her white hair kissed anew,"
712,II,We two.
713,II,
714,II,"Sweet little sister, dost recall"
715,II,The stream that bathed the castle-wall?
716,II,The old round-tower whence came alway
717,II,The call
718,II,Of bells to banish night away
719,II,At day?
720,II,
721,II,Dost thou recall the lake--how still!--
722,II,Where swallows skimmed at their sweet will?
723,II,"The reeds, swayed by the gentle air"
724,II,Until
725,II,"The sun set on the waters there,"
726,II,So fair?
727,II,
728,II,"Oh, who will give me my Helène?"
729,II,"My mountains, my great oak again?"
730,II,Their memory brings with all my days
731,II,Fresh pain;
732,II,"My land shall be my love, my praise"
733,II,Always!
734,II,
735,II,
736,II,My Little Red Devil and I.
737,II,
738,II,“The Prince of Darkness is a gentleman.”
739,II,
740,II,_Twelfth Night._
741,II,
742,II,My little Red Devil upon my desk
743,II,With a smile sardonic stands.
744,II,He holds my pen with a patient air
745,II,"In his crooked, outstretched hands;"
746,II,The paint is worn from his hoof and horn
747,II,"And scratched is his curving tail,"
748,II,"Yet he still holds on with a right good grace,"
749,II,"A knowing look on his crafty face,"
750,II,And spirits that never fail.
751,II,
752,II,"So, what if his fingers are some of them gone,"
753,II,And twisted the horns on his head?
754,II,"His cheek still glows, and his aquiline nose"
755,II,Is a genuine devilish red;
756,II,"And his tail, beside, is a thing of pride,"
757,II,"For it swings in a glorious sweep,"
758,II,With a graceful bend and a fork in the end
759,II,"That would cause a sinner his ways to mend,"
760,II,"Or a saint, his vows to keep!"
761,II,
762,II,Though only a single eye has he
763,II,"The world and the flesh to view,"
764,II,"(For the right is gone,) yet the other one"
765,II,Has fire enough for two.
766,II,So his eyes ill-mated an air jocund
767,II,"To his wrinkled features lend,"
768,II,And to see his look you would almost think
769,II,That he was tipping a devilish wink
770,II,"To his old, familiar friend."
771,II,
772,II,"Oh, he is a jolly good fellow, in truth,"
773,II,"With a wit that is ever new,"
774,II,"And a heart like which, in this world of ours,"
775,II,"There are only, I fear, too few."
776,II,And he doesn’t complain when I come in late
777,II,"Or keep him awake o’ nights,"
778,II,"So I have respect for his comfort, too,"
779,II,"By giving the Devil his utmost due,"
780,II,And the whole of his royal rights.
781,II,
782,II,To everyone else but myself his smile
783,II,Is fixed as the solid stone;
784,II,He changes the curve of his parted lips
785,II,"For me, and for me alone."
786,II,So when I’m in luck he wishes me joy
787,II,"With his whole Satanic heart,"
788,II,"But when I’ve the blues, it seems he would say"
789,II,"“Brace up, for the luck will be better some day!”"
790,II,And my cares like the wind depart.
791,II,
792,II,So my Devil and I are the best of friends
793,II,"In a sort of a cynical way,"
794,II,For he watches me out of his only eye
795,II,"As I work at my desk each day,"
796,II,"And the idle verses I write in hope,"
797,II,"He quietly smiles to see,"
798,II,"For he knows full well that at first or last,"
799,II,"Like Biblical bread on the waters cast,"
800,II,They will surely come back to me...
801,II,
802,II,"And at night, as I sit by the ruddy hearth,"
803,II,"With my pipe and my book, alone,"
804,II,Or lazily muse by the embers red
805,II,"When the light of the fire is gone,"
806,II,"I think of him sometimes, and hope in my heart"
807,II,I never shall see the day
808,II,That sets me adrift from my little friend
809,II,"And puts to our sociable life an end,"
810,II,By taking my Devil away!...

874,II,
875,II,"Far in the west the crescent moon hung low,"
876,II,"A filmy haze about it faintly spread,"
877,II,"And one bright star, a point of silver light"
878,II,Seem’d comrade to it. Whispering Zephyrus
879,II,"Tender as love, stole through the list’ning leaves,"
880,II,"Making a pleasant murmur in the night,"
881,II,And touched the glimmering waters with his breath.
882,II,"The ripples came unnumbered to the shore,"
883,II,Soft-murmuring through the sedge and fenny reeds
884,II,With that same whisp’ring voice that Pan once heard
885,II,What time he first made pipes to sound the praise
886,II,Of her whom he had lost. The water’s breast
887,II,Was banded with a path of shimmering light
888,II,"Broken by the ever-restless waves, which made"
889,II,A thousand points of liquid brilliancy.
890,II,"And in the beauty of still, hallowed night"
891,II,"Beside the plashing sandy shore, we met"
892,II,"In happiness. Each whispering of the wind,"
893,II,"Each tremulous leaf, and even the sleeping flowers"
894,II,"Seem’d breathing “Love” in tender unison,"
895,II,And the sphered star in Heaven sang that word.
896,II,"Dost thou remember how from out the grass,"
897,II,"I plucked a gentle flow’ret by that shore,"
898,II,"--Anemone some call it, wind-flower some,"
899,II,Sprung from the crimson of Adonis’ blood
900,II,"Where he was slain,--and how I softly said,"
901,II,"“O thou belovèd, beauty is a rose"
902,II,"Growing in Life’s fair garden, by the spring"
903,II,"Of deathless Purity, and that clear dew"
904,II,"Which lies within its sweetness hid, is Love.”"
905,II,"Dost thou recall? And so it chance, I pray"
906,II,"Though we be parted, now and evermore,"
907,II,"Think sometimes of that night, and fancy still"
908,II,"We see the summer landscape, glimmering,"
909,II,"Lit by the steady-burning lights of heaven,"
910,II,"We scent the sweetness of the warm young night,"
911,II,"We hold the tender wind-flower, and still hear"
912,II,The murmuring ripples on the sounding shore.

1560,HAMPTON HOLIDAYS.,Whirled from the maelstrom of the polar sea
1561,HAMPTON HOLIDAYS.,To sweep our mighty hill in mockery

1563,HAMPTON HOLIDAYS.,And wrap their frozen mother. Stiffly lined
1564,HAMPTON HOLIDAYS.,Through thin and crackling ice the leaves lie stark

1727,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,Over the spinet let her fair hand glide.
1728,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,So soft the murmur was it scarce could seem

1730,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Soft moving lest the birds, warm-nested there"

1732,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,Of that sweet summer night breathed forth to us
1733,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,From flowery chalices beside the glimmering stream.
1734,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,Far in the silent grove the chestnut-trees
1735,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,And ancient oaks swayed their sad branches slow;
1736,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"We sat and, listening to the amorous breeze,"
1737,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,Through the half-opened casement let the low
1738,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Sweet breath of Spring float in. The winds were still,"
1739,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,The plain deserted. All alone we were
1740,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,And very young... Lucie was blonde and pale
1741,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,And pensive. As I musing gazed on her
1742,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,No sweeter eyes than hers e’er pierced the deep
1743,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Of purest heaven, or mirrored back its blue."
1744,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,I with her beauty drunken was; in all

1747,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"A sister, in all innocence. We two"
1748,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Sat silent and alone; my hand touched hers,"
1749,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,I watched the dreams upon her face and knew
1750,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,In my own soul how strong to heal distress
1751,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Are those twin signs of peace and happiness,"
1752,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Youth in the heart, youth mirrored on the brow."

1777,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,"Drooping upon my heart, she leaned her head."
1778,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,The cry of Desdemona didst thou hear

1781,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,Sweet mouth in sadness let me press mine own;

1786,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,Oh my chaste flower! And thy dying was
1787,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,A smile as sweet as thy fair life had been.
1788,MORS OMNIUM VICTOR,God took thee pure as when He gave thee breath.

1935,III.,For here in the grave I died...
1936,III.,"Yea, I screamed full loud in my ghastly shroud"
1937,III.,"When I woke in the noisome gloom,"
1938,III.,And the sweat of my agony froze like ice
1939,III.,As I fought with my fearful doom...
1940,III.,
1941,III.,"But now--I am dead, though my lips still laugh"
1942,III.,"In the motionless black of night,"
1943,III.,"Though my bleared eyes stare in the grave, for they see"
1944,III.,
1945,III.,Not even the glow-worm’s light;
1946,III.,Yet still I can see that to buried be
1947,III.,"Is a sweet and a happy thing,"
1948,III.,"For I sing my Song in the House of Death,"
1949,III.,And this is the Song I sing:
1950,III.,
1951,III.,Welcome - slimy - worm - with - sightless - head -
1952,III.,Blindly - burrowing - in - the - fearful - night -
1953,III.,Happy - shouldst - thou - be - for - lack - of - sight -
1954,III.,Since - thou - canst - not - see - that - I - am - dead -
1955,III.,When - thou - comest - from - thy - secret - place -
1956,III.,Eating - through - the - earth - with - silent - care -
1957,III.,Boldly - come - I - bid - and - boldly - dare -
1958,III.,Down - to - drop - upon - my - leaden - face -
1959,III.,Drag - thy - sluggish - slime - across - my - eyes -
1960,III.,They - will - never - close - to - touch - of - thine -
1961,III.,Coil - within - these - hideous - lips - of - mine -
1962,III.,Where - a - Maid - breathed - long - ago - her - sighs -
1963,III.,
1964,III.,Welcome - slimy - worm - with - creeping - head -
1965,III.,Meet - it - is - that - thou - my - friend - shouldst - be -
1966,III.,Happy - art - thou - since - thou - canst - not - see -
1967,III.,I - am - buried - deep - and - I - am - dead
1968,III.,
1969,III.,Then these be the words of the Song of Death
1970,III.,That I sing in my prison-cell.
1971,III.,"It charms the worms with the hooded heads,"
1972,III.,And the worms I love full well.
1973,III.,"It charms the worms, though my singing is"
1974,III.,"But a mouthing, mumbling groan,"
1975,III.,For I have no breath in this House of Death
1976,III.,And I mutter with lips alone...
1977,III.,
1978,III.,"So, my tale it is told of the dread and cold"
1979,III.,In the depths of this livid gloom;
1980,III.,"And I motionless lie, as I strive to die,"
1981,III.,"As I rot in my narrow room,"
1982,III.,For I am not dead whilst my fearful head
1983,III.,"The foul, fat worms forsake;"
1984,III.,"But, when that is gone, then my dream it is done,"
1985,III.,"And I sleep at last, never to wake..."
1986,III.,
1987,III.,*       *       *       *       *
1988,III.,
1989,III.,"This is the Song of Death,"
1990,III.,This is the burial-note
1991,III.,After the end of breath
1992,III.,Gasped by corrupted throat;
1993,III.,After the passing breath
1994,III.,Heard from the grave remote;
1995,III.,"This is the burial-note,"
1996,III.,This is the Song of Death...
