164,FOREWORD.,
165,FOREWORD.,"_""Fair the Dandelion is,"
166,FOREWORD.,But for me too lowly;
167,FOREWORD.,And the winsome Violet
168,FOREWORD.,"Is, forsooth, too holy."
169,FOREWORD.,'But the Touchmenot?' Go to!
170,FOREWORD.,What! a face that's speckled
171,FOREWORD.,"Like a common milking-maid's,"
172,FOREWORD.,Whom the sun hath freckled.
173,FOREWORD.,Then the Wild-Rose is a flirt;
174,FOREWORD.,"And the trillium Lily,"
175,FOREWORD.,"In her spotless gown, 's a prude,"
176,FOREWORD.,Sanctified and silly.
177,FOREWORD.,"By her cap the Columbine,"
178,FOREWORD.,"To my mind, 's too merry;"
179,FOREWORD.,"Gossips, I would sooner wed"
180,FOREWORD.,Some plebeian Berry.

182,FOREWORD.,"Well, her face shows sorrow;"

187,FOREWORD.,She's been chosen overmuch!--
188,FOREWORD.,"Sirs, I mean the Daisy."

198,FOREWORD.,"_In my youth 'twas thus I sang,"
199,FOREWORD.,"In my heart's young hours,"
200,FOREWORD.,"In the first rare spring of song,"
201,FOREWORD.,Choosing 'mid the flowers.
202,FOREWORD.,So I hesitated when
203,FOREWORD.,Time alone was reckoned
204,FOREWORD.,"By the hours that Fancy smiled,"
205,FOREWORD.,Love and Beauty beckoned.
206,FOREWORD.,Hard it was for me to choose
207,FOREWORD.,From the flowers that flattered;
208,FOREWORD.,And the blossom that I chose
209,FOREWORD.,Soon lay dead and scattered.
210,FOREWORD.,"Hard I found it then, ah, me!"
211,FOREWORD.,Hard I found the choosing;
212,FOREWORD.,"Harder, harder since I've found,"
213,FOREWORD.,"Ah, too hard the losing."
214,FOREWORD.,Haply had I chosen then
215,FOREWORD.,From the weeds that tangle
216,FOREWORD.,"Wayside, woodland and the wall"
217,FOREWORD.,"Of my garden's angle,"
218,FOREWORD.,"I had chosen better, yea,"

232,A WILD IRIS.,
233,A WILD IRIS.,
234,A WILD IRIS.,"That day we wandered 'mid the hills,--so lone"
235,A WILD IRIS.,"Clouds are not lonelier,--the forest lay"
236,A WILD IRIS.,In emerald darkness 'round us. Many a stone
237,A WILD IRIS.,"And gnarly root, gray-mossed, made wild our way;"
238,A WILD IRIS.,And many a bird the glimmering light along
239,A WILD IRIS.,Showered the golden bubbles of its song.
240,A WILD IRIS.,
241,A WILD IRIS.,"Then in the valley, where the brook went by,"
242,A WILD IRIS.,"Silvering the ledges that it rippled from,--"
243,A WILD IRIS.,"An isolated slip of fallen sky,"
244,A WILD IRIS.,"Epitomizing heaven in its sum,--"
245,A WILD IRIS.,"An iris bloomed--blue, as if, flower-disguised,"
246,A WILD IRIS.,The gaze of Spring had there materialized.
247,A WILD IRIS.,
248,A WILD IRIS.,I have forgotten many things since then--
249,A WILD IRIS.,Much beauty and much happiness and grief;
250,A WILD IRIS.,"And toiled and dreamed among my fellow-men,"
251,A WILD IRIS.,Rejoicing in the knowledge life is brief.
252,A WILD IRIS.,"""'T is winter now,"" so says each barren bough;"
253,A WILD IRIS.,And face and hair proclaim 't is winter now.
254,A WILD IRIS.,
255,A WILD IRIS.,I would forget the gladness of that spring!
256,A WILD IRIS.,"I would forget that day when she and I,"
257,A WILD IRIS.,"Between the bird-song and the blossoming,"
258,A WILD IRIS.,Went hand in hand beneath the soft spring sky!--
259,A WILD IRIS.,"Much is forgotten, yea--and yet, and yet,"
260,A WILD IRIS.,The things we would we never can forget.--
261,A WILD IRIS.,
262,A WILD IRIS.,Nor I how May then minted treasuries
263,A WILD IRIS.,Of crowfoot gold; and molded out of light
264,A WILD IRIS.,"The sorrel's cups, whose elfin chalices"
265,A WILD IRIS.,Of limpid spar were streaked with rosy white.
266,A WILD IRIS.,"Nor all the stars of twinkling spiderwort,"
267,A WILD IRIS.,And mandrake moons with which her brows were girt.
268,A WILD IRIS.,
269,A WILD IRIS.,"But most of all, yea, it were well for me,"
270,A WILD IRIS.,"Me and my heart, that I forget that flower,"
271,A WILD IRIS.,"The wild blue iris, azure fleur-de-lis,"
272,A WILD IRIS.,That she and I together found that hour.
273,A WILD IRIS.,Its recollection can but emphasize
274,A WILD IRIS.,"The pain of loss, remindful of her eyes."

282,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,There is a path that leads
283,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Through purple iron-weeds,"
284,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,By button-bush and mallow
285,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Along a creek;
286,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"A path that wildflowers hallow,"
287,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,That wild birds seek;
288,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Roofed thick with eglantine
289,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,And grape and trumpet-vine.
290,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
291,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"This side, blackberries sweet"
292,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Glow cobalt in the heat;
293,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"That side, a creamy yellow,"
294,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,In summertime
295,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,The pawpaws slowly mellow;
296,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,And autumn's prime
297,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Strews red the Chickasaw,"
298,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Persimmon brown and haw.
299,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
300,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"The glittering dragon-fly,"
301,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"A wingéd flash, goes by;"
302,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,And tawny wasp and hornet
303,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Seem gleams that drone;
304,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"The beetle, like a garnet,"
305,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Slips from the stone;
306,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"And butterflies float there,"
307,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Spangling with gold the air.
308,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
309,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Here the brown thrashers hide,"
310,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,The chat and cat-bird chide;
311,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,The blue kingfisher houses
312,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Above the stream,"
313,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,And here the heron drowses
314,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Lost in his dream;
315,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,The vireo's flitting note
316,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Haunts all the wild remote.
317,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
318,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,And now a cow's slow bell
319,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Tinkles along the dell;
320,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Where breeze-dropped petals winnow
321,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,From blossomy limbs
322,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"On waters, where the minnow,"
323,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Faint-twinkling, swims;"
324,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Where, in the root-arched shade,"
325,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Slim prisms of light are laid.
326,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
327,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,When in the tangled thorn
328,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"The new-moon hangs a horn,"
329,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Or, 'mid the sunset's islands,"
330,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Guides a canoe,"
331,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,The brown owl in the silence
332,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Calls, and the dew"
333,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Beads here its orbs of damp,"
334,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Each one a firefly lamp.
335,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
336,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Then when the night is still
337,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Here sings the whippoorwill;
338,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"And stealthy sounds of crickets,"
339,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"And winds that pass,"
340,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Whispering, through bramble thickets"
341,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Along the grass,"
342,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Faint with far scents of hay,"
343,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Seem feet of dreams astray.
344,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
345,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,And where the water shines
346,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Dark through tree-twisted vines,"
347,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Some water-spirit, dreaming,"
348,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Braids in her hair
349,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,A star's reflection; seeming
350,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,A jewel there;
351,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,While all the sweet night long
352,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Ripples her quiet song....
353,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
354,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Would I could imitate,"
355,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"O path, thy happy state!"
356,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Making my life all beauty,"

361,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Lead feet that come and go.
362,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,
363,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Leading to calm content,"
364,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"O'er ways the Master went,"
365,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"Through lowly things and humble,"
366,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,To peace and love;
367,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,Teaching the lives that stumble
368,THE PATH BY THE CREEK.,"To look above,"
