37,,"Ten idle, wasted summers gone, and how"

49,,Art happier there than I who mourn thee now.

83,I. S. D.,
84,I. S. D.,"About a year ago, having collected all those poems and verses which I"
85,I. S. D.,"considered of any value, I took a certain pride in the thought that I"
86,I. S. D.,"might soon bring under one roof these imaginary children of mine, so"
87,I. S. D.,"that they might be sheltered in time of storm, as it were, from the"
88,I. S. D.,"cold, and oftimes unfeeling world of commerce but where friends of"
89,I. S. D.,"poetry, who had met with some of my stray children of verse in public"
90,I. S. D.,"journals, might meet with them again, if they desired, with other"
91,I. S. D.,friendly faces around one common fireside.
92,I. S. D.,
93,I. S. D.,But I found that the expense incident to such a venture was so great
94,I. S. D.,that unless a large number of copies were sold I would be involved in a
95,I. S. D.,larger debt than I cared to contract. Then the plan of securing
96,I. S. D.,sufficient advance subscriptions to meet part of the expense of a first
97,I. S. D.,"edition occurred to me, thereby following the method of Tennyson, Robert"
98,I. S. D.,"Burns and others, of whose example I needed not to be ashamed, but other"
99,I. S. D.,"work prevented me, and still prevents me, from carrying out this plan."
100,I. S. D.,
101,I. S. D.,So lest those friends who have shown an interest in my verses should
102,I. S. D.,"think that I have turned aside from the Path of Poetry, I herewith offer"
103,I. S. D.,"""The Calendar and Other Verses,"" as evidence of my love for and interest"
104,I. S. D.,"in the greatest of all the arts, hoping that the time may come when I"
105,I. S. D.,shall be able to present a more worthy offering to the Muses and perhaps
106,I. S. D.,justify the kind words that have recently appeared in regards to the
107,I. S. D.,"author of ""The Quiet Life""--A Plain Poem of the Hills, which, in a"
108,I. S. D.,"revised form, appeared serially during the past summer in The Wayne"

134,JANUARY,
135,JANUARY,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis January;
136,JANUARY,The knee-deep snow lies heavy on the ground
137,JANUARY,And hark!--the icy winds--how swift they hurry
138,JANUARY,Over the fields with melancholy sound;
139,JANUARY,"And save these winds or some forsaken raven,"
140,JANUARY,"Winging its way along yon frozen hill,"
141,JANUARY,Nature is hush'd--her dormant image graven
142,JANUARY,"In marble masks on woodland, lake and rill."
143,JANUARY,
144,JANUARY,"And look!--the trees their naked trunks are swaying,"
145,JANUARY,"As bitterly each blast goes howling by,"
146,JANUARY,"And hark!--the music in the hemlocks playing,"
147,JANUARY,"Like some lost spirit banished from the sky,"
148,JANUARY,"And see the smoke from yonder chimney curling,"
149,JANUARY,"Hugs the broad roofs, deep-burden'd with the snow,"
150,JANUARY,While clouds of snow are round the low eaves whirling.
151,JANUARY,"How cold it is!--Come, let us homeward go"
152,JANUARY,"There will we find the cheerful fire still burning,"
153,JANUARY,"There ruddy warmth will make our faces glow,"
154,JANUARY,And there kind hearts will welcome our returning;
155,JANUARY,Come!--let us hasten through the drifty snow.

158,FEBRUARY.,FEBRUARY.
159,FEBRUARY.,
160,FEBRUARY.,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis February;
161,FEBRUARY.,"The sun is creeping slowly toward the North,"
162,FEBRUARY.,"And every breeze to-day seems blithe and merry,"
163,FEBRUARY.,And prophets of the Spring are waking forth--
164,FEBRUARY.,"The hungry ground-hog casts a thin, gray shadow"
165,FEBRUARY.,"Beside his open villa, dark and cold,"
166,FEBRUARY.,"And the starv'd hare surveys the icy meadow,"
167,FEBRUARY.,And chipmonks chatter in the leafless wold.
168,FEBRUARY.,
169,FEBRUARY.,"And hark!--the blue-jay's fife is sounding shrilly,"
170,FEBRUARY.,"And merry chickadees are piping loud,"
171,FEBRUARY.,"E'en though the bitter North-wind's breath is chilly,"
172,FEBRUARY.,And the great trees are low before him bow'd;
173,FEBRUARY.,And see!--the Lady of the South is creeping
174,FEBRUARY.,"Higher and higher--'Tis the hour of noon,"
175,FEBRUARY.,"And sad-eyed Winter by yon brook is weeping,--"
176,FEBRUARY.,Yon little brook that sings a pleasant tune.
177,FEBRUARY.,"Yet, as the sun is with the day declining,"
178,FEBRUARY.,"Swift, darkening clouds are gathering in the West,"
179,FEBRUARY.,Where the snow-fairies are again designing
180,FEBRUARY.,Another robe for Nature's barren breast.
181,FEBRUARY.,
182,FEBRUARY.,
183,MARCH.,MARCH.
184,MARCH.,
185,MARCH.,"Come walk a mile with me--'Tis March and windy,"
186,MARCH.,"And Winter's dying breath comes hard and fast,"
187,MARCH.,"And hark!--the storm, like death-bells of a Sunday,"
188,MARCH.,Tolls the sad knell upon the icy blast;
189,MARCH.,"Louder and louder now the winds are wailing,"
190,MARCH.,"Faster and faster wings the frozen snow,"
191,MARCH.,"Darker and darker the cold clouds are sailing,"
192,MARCH.,As the March-storm goes hurrying to and fro.
193,MARCH.,
194,MARCH.,"But see!--the sun above the clouds is creeping,"
195,MARCH.,"And look!--soft flakes are falling, one by one,"
196,MARCH.,"And Winter, pale in death, lies gently sleeping,"
197,MARCH.,While Spring awakes e'er half the day is done.
198,MARCH.,"And soon the sun, like some great hearth is burning,"
199,MARCH.,"Melting the ghosts of Winter on the hills,"
200,MARCH.,"And hark!--the robin from the South returning,"
201,MARCH.,"Joins the glad music of the murmuring rills,"
202,MARCH.,"And now the farmer-boy, whose heart is leaping,"
203,MARCH.,"Gathers the sap that sings a merry song,"
204,MARCH.,"While the blue-birds sweet melodies are keeping,"
205,MARCH.,And noisy squirrels leap the trees among.

208,APRIL.,APRIL.
209,APRIL.,
210,APRIL.,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis April weather;
211,APRIL.,A voice like Spring is calling: Let us go
212,APRIL.,"Where violets are blooming on the heather,"
213,APRIL.,And song-birds bend the branches to and fro;
214,APRIL.,"For everywhere the very ground is springing,"
215,APRIL.,And everywhere the grass is getting green--
216,APRIL.,How can I now--how can I keep from singing
217,APRIL.,When all the world is like a fairy scene!
218,APRIL.,
219,APRIL.,"The buds in all the trees, are ripe for bursting,"
220,APRIL.,"And fleecy catkins flutter everywhere,"
221,APRIL.,And every little flower seems a-thirsting
222,APRIL.,For something sweet and beautiful and fair.
223,APRIL.,But look!--to Westward--see!--an April shower
224,APRIL.,"Sudden has gathered, darkening the sun,"
225,APRIL.,"Yet wait!--beside me lifts a gentle flower,"
226,APRIL.,"That lights my pathway, blossoming alone;"
227,APRIL.,"And hark!--O hark, the meadow-lark is singing,"
228,APRIL.,"Greeting the storm from yon tall maple tree,"
229,APRIL.,"While, like a herald in its homeward winging,"
230,APRIL.,Wheels a lone flicker o'er the darkening lea.

233,MAY,MAY
234,MAY,
235,MAY,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis merry May-time;
236,MAY,"The little lambs are gamboling on the green,--"
237,MAY,"Nature is glad--it is her hour of playtime,"
238,MAY,"And now, or never, her true heart is seen;"
239,MAY,"The butterflies are floating down from heaven,"
240,MAY,"And humming-birds again are on the wing,--"
241,MAY,"And the kind swallows, seventy times seven,"
242,MAY,Fill all the air with merry murmuring.
243,MAY,
244,MAY,And see the lilacs by yon cottage blooming!--
245,MAY,"How sweet the air is!--sweetness everywhere,"
246,MAY,For look!--rich apple-blossoms are perfuming
247,MAY,"This little lane that leads to woodlands fair,--"
248,MAY,"Here honeysuckle-bells are softly swinging,"
249,MAY,"And pink azaleas perfume all the wood,"
250,MAY,"And, in the trees, the vireos are singing"
251,MAY,"Incessantly their songs of solitude,"
252,MAY,"While round the hill, as slow our steps are wending,"
253,MAY,"We hear a sweet Voice calling,--""Come, O come!"""
254,MAY,"For see!--the sun is in the West decending,"
255,MAY,And happy hearts are waiting us at home.

258,JUNE,JUNE
259,JUNE,
260,JUNE,"Come walk a mile with me--'Tis June,--fair June-day,"
261,JUNE,"And Nature smiles--her magic hands are still,"
262,JUNE,"For not a ripple stirs yon lake at noon-day,"
263,JUNE,And not a breeze disturbs this woody hill;
264,JUNE,But hark!--what idle dreamer there is drumming?
265,JUNE,"It is--it is a pheasant calling--""Come!"""
266,JUNE,And listen!--like a low voice sweetly humming
267,JUNE,Is heard the brook within its forest home.
268,JUNE,
269,JUNE,"But wait!--We cannot wait--'Twill soon be Summer,"
270,JUNE,"So let us now enjoy these days of June,"
271,JUNE,"For hear ye not that late, but welcome comer,"
272,JUNE,Robert-of-Lincoln carroling his tune;
273,JUNE,And see ye not yon oriole high swinging
274,JUNE,His basket from that tall and leafy tree--
275,JUNE,"O Comrade, Comrade!--Time is swiftly winging,--"
276,JUNE,'Twill not be always June with you and me;
277,JUNE,"Spring-time is passing--Summer is a-coming,"
278,JUNE,"And soon fair Autumn with her idle dreams,"
279,JUNE,"And then cold Winter, her White hands benumbing"
280,JUNE,"The icy lakes and silent, woodland streams!"
281,JUNE,
282,JUNE,"O Comrade!--Comrade!--let us not be weary,"
283,JUNE,"But pick life's pretty blossoms while they bloom,"
284,JUNE,"Forgetting every prospect, sad or dreary,"
285,JUNE,Avoiding every lane that leads to gloom!
286,JUNE,For see!--each flower lifts a golden chalice
287,JUNE,"Inviting us to drink--Shall we pass by,"
288,JUNE,"With faces sad, nor enter this fair palace"
289,JUNE,That June has rear'd us 'neath a cloudless sky?

296,JULY.,
297,JULY.,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis July weather;
298,JULY.,"The western sun is burning round and bright,"
299,JULY.,And not a breeze disturbs yon tiny feather
300,JULY.,From a young swallow loosen'd in its flight;
301,JULY.,But hark!--in yonder broad and sunlit meadow
302,JULY.,"The sound of busy mowers fill the air,"
303,JULY.,"While from a tree that casts a pleasing shadow,"
304,JULY.,Is heard the locust piping shrilly there.
305,JULY.,
306,JULY.,"And see, how strong men lift the scented grasses!"
307,JULY.,And how they pile the wagons with the hay!
308,JULY.,"How fast the rake, with rolling burden, passes!"
309,JULY.,"How regular the long, round winrows lay!"
310,JULY.,"And see!--the sun--the great round sun is setting,"
311,JULY.,"Like a red rose upon the distant hill,"
312,JULY.,Till all the earth seems tenderly forgetting
313,JULY.,"Day's dying light on meadow, lake and rill;"
314,JULY.,"But come!--for darkness soon will gather round us,"
315,JULY.,And we must pass through yonder woodlands there;
316,JULY.,"And then white fields of buckwheat will surround us,"
317,JULY.,And then--then--home we shall together share.

321,AUGUST,
322,AUGUST,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis August. Listen!
323,AUGUST,"The meadow-quail is whistling merrily,"
324,AUGUST,"And see!--the dew-drops, like great diamonds, glisten"
325,AUGUST,On grass and shrub and bush and bending tree;
326,AUGUST,"And everywhere is peace and joy and plenty,"
327,AUGUST,For everywhere this morning we may go
328,AUGUST,"One seed of Spring has well returned its twenty,"
329,AUGUST,Till Autumn's face with goodness is aglow.
330,AUGUST,
331,AUGUST,"Yes, oaten fields are white and ripe for reaping,"
332,AUGUST,And green things paling in the garden there
333,AUGUST,"Tell us too well that Summer is a-sleeping,"
334,AUGUST,And harvest-time is on us unaware;
335,AUGUST,"The early apples even now are falling,"
336,AUGUST,"The tassel'd corn, the fields of ripening rye,"
337,AUGUST,"The purpling grape--all, all are sadly calling"
338,AUGUST,"That Summer's glory, too, must fade and die."
339,AUGUST,"But hark!--what sound is that!--it seems like thunder,"
340,AUGUST,"And yet 'tis but the wind, within the trees,--"
341,AUGUST,"The far-off wind, fresh-filled with nameless wonder,--"
342,AUGUST,A prophesy of Autumn's freshening breeze.

346,SEPTEMBER,
347,SEPTEMBER,Come walk a mile with me--'Tis sweet September;
348,SEPTEMBER,"And quietly the clouds are gliding by,"
349,SEPTEMBER,"And silent runs the brook that, you remember,"
350,SEPTEMBER,"We pass'd last Spring--it now is dumb and dry,"
351,SEPTEMBER,"And overhead, the first red leaf is falling,"
352,SEPTEMBER,"And, underfoot, the flowers are fading fast,"
353,SEPTEMBER,"While in the air I hear a strange, sad calling"
354,SEPTEMBER,That tells me Summer is forever past.
355,SEPTEMBER,
356,SEPTEMBER,"And yet how peaceful seems the face of Heaven,"
357,SEPTEMBER,"How calm the earth is--Nature is at rest,"
358,SEPTEMBER,"And all the hopes that unto Spring were given,"
359,SEPTEMBER,Folds Autumn now in silence to her breast;
360,SEPTEMBER,"The birds are singing, yet not half so sweetly"
361,SEPTEMBER,"As when they sung their song at opening Spring,"
362,SEPTEMBER,"And flowers are blooming, yet not so completely"
363,SEPTEMBER,As when the birds were first upon the wing;
364,SEPTEMBER,And I am singing--but the fading glory
365,SEPTEMBER,"Of Autumn-time subdues my idle song,"
366,SEPTEMBER,For what is Autumn but the sweet sad story
367,SEPTEMBER,Of leaves that fade and lives that last not long.

373,OCTOBER,And yet the fields put forth fresh blades of green.
374,OCTOBER,"Lest the advancing days shall seem to sober,"
375,OCTOBER,And prophesy too plainly the unseen;
376,OCTOBER,"For Nature loves to lead us forward blindly,--"
377,OCTOBER,Giving a glory to the fading leaf!
378,OCTOBER,"Yet were it worse if, speaking less unkindly,"
379,OCTOBER,Nature should plainly tell us life is brief.
380,OCTOBER,
381,OCTOBER,"The flowers, too, are fading--and are dying,"
382,OCTOBER,"The leaves are falling, and incessantly,"
383,OCTOBER,"And on the hills great flocks of crows are crying,"
384,OCTOBER,And the blue-jays once more are calling me;
385,OCTOBER,"But Winter!--Winter soon, too soon, is coming,"
386,OCTOBER,"For see!--see there,--the frost is on the grass!"
387,OCTOBER,And the wild-bee--I hear no more its humming
388,OCTOBER,"As once I did, wherever I might pass;"
389,OCTOBER,"And robin--he is gone, and all the singing"
390,OCTOBER,"Of all the sweet birds now no more I hear,"
391,OCTOBER,"While the dry leaves, to barren branches clinging,"
392,OCTOBER,Full plainly speak the passing of the year.

397,NOVEMBER,Come walk a mile with me--November!--Faintly
398,NOVEMBER,"The long, blue hills lift to the eastern sky;"
399,NOVEMBER,"'Tis Indian-summer now--this day seems saintly,"
400,NOVEMBER,Like some good martyr e'er he goes to die;
401,NOVEMBER,"The skies are cloudless; not a breeze is blowing,"
402,NOVEMBER,And silent is each bare and leafless form;
403,NOVEMBER,"The brooks--how quiet!--I like not their flowing,"
404,NOVEMBER,"For oh,--it is the calm before the storm."
405,NOVEMBER,
406,NOVEMBER,"Yes, yes--e'en now--to Westward--look! a figure"
407,NOVEMBER,"Is sudden forming, stretching forth a wand,"
408,NOVEMBER,"Shaping a shape as of some giant, bigger"
409,NOVEMBER,Than any fabled thing from Fairyland;
410,NOVEMBER,"Higher and higher that strange shape is lifting,"
411,NOVEMBER,"Swifter and swifter its fleet heralds run,"
412,NOVEMBER,Wider and wider its white breath is drifting
413,NOVEMBER,As lower sinks the slow decending sun;
414,NOVEMBER,And now--the storm!--the storm is on us. Hurry!
415,NOVEMBER,Yet see!--the myriad snow-flakes--see them come!
416,NOVEMBER,O Comrade!--See!--it is young Winter's flurry--
417,NOVEMBER,And yet 'tis but the storm that drives us home.

424,DECEMBER,O for the days of Spring I well remember!
425,DECEMBER,O for the flowers that blossomed on the hill!--
426,DECEMBER,"And wish you not that you,--you too were playing"
427,DECEMBER,"Upon the hillside, building castles there,"
428,DECEMBER,"Dreaming sweet dreams, as when we went a-Maying,"
429,DECEMBER,Midst singing birds and blossoms sweet and fair?
430,DECEMBER,
431,DECEMBER,"But hark, the wind!--and see, the falling snow-flakes!"
432,DECEMBER,How thick they come--how beautiful they seem!
433,DECEMBER,Yet I am weary--weary of the snow-flakes--
434,DECEMBER,"O Comrade!--tell me,--is it all a dream;"
435,DECEMBER,O Comrade!--Comrade!--Winter is upon us;
436,DECEMBER,"Our hopes, like snow-flakes, now are falling fast,"
437,DECEMBER,Our dreams are broken--God have mercy on us!--
438,DECEMBER,We must not perish in the wintry blast--
439,DECEMBER,"For see, O see!--the sun,--the sun is shining!"
440,DECEMBER,"'Tis noon, and lo!--yon glorious orb of day"
441,DECEMBER,"Is turning backward, a New-year designing--"
442,DECEMBER,So shall all Winters turn to Spring alway.
443,DECEMBER,
444,DECEMBER,And so shall Winter be an emblem only
445,DECEMBER,"Of the dark days that meet us, one and all,"
446,DECEMBER,"Making our little lives seem sad and lonely,"
447,DECEMBER,"Until the New-Year answers to our call,"
448,DECEMBER,Until another Spring renewing Nature;
449,DECEMBER,Renews our hopes that were so desolate
450,DECEMBER,Giving us faith that not one living creature
451,DECEMBER,Is blindly born to blindly meet its fate.

573,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"At birth this school begins, at death it ends,"
574,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"And many terms there be,--and faithful teachers"
575,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,Not a few. Necessity is one;
576,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,For e'en the babe when first it feels the cool
577,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"And earthly air, and sees the light of day,"
578,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Shrinks from their touch, and cries aloud--herewith"
579,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,It doth begin to learn the alphabet
580,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,Of life. Then hunger comes; and so to ease
581,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,Itself the babe doth learn to love the things
582,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"That give it life. Thus hour by hour, and day"
583,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,By day it gathers knowledge at the school
584,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"But knows it not--even as wiser men,"

590,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Repeating words of wisdom, gems of truth"

592,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,Until at length in childish innocence
593,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"It leaves the kindergarten of the world,"
594,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"And knocks upon the door of adult life,"
595,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"And enters there, flushed with the lulling sense"

603,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,There is a longing now for deeper life
604,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,That fills the heart to overflow--there is

645,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Is here--the errors and the follies, everyone,"

655,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"These, his instructors, will rehearse him well,"
656,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Lest he forget in later life these things,"
657,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"And be a dullard in the school of schools,"

665,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Yet leaves the student to himself alone,"
666,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,Half puzzled by the figures on the dial
667,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,That tell the hour when he shall graduate
668,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Above earth's petty problems, and shall hold"
669,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"A clearance to that life which is to come,"
670,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"And whereunto he graduates, perchance,"
671,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,A better man.
672,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"A better man--if not,"
673,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,So shall he go again in that same grade
674,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Where like a laggard half-asleep in school,"
675,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"He wakes to find himself a scholar still,"
676,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"With all the vexing problems yet unsolved,"
677,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Which, in his idleness and lust of life,"
678,THE SCHOOL OF LIFE,"Were left until the morrow, and the sun"

1020,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1021,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"""Titanic!--rightly named, sir""--says the captain of the ship,"
1022,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"""And the safest of all vessels--now mark her maiden trip,"""
1023,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And all think as the captain thinks--all her two thousand souls
1024,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,As steadily out o'er the sea the stately vessel rolls.
1025,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1026,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"For she is shod with iron and her frame is built of oak,"
1027,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And stout hearts man the vessel, wherefore the captain spoke;"
1028,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And with naught for pleasure lacking, so stately and so fair,"
1029,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,She seems a floating palace--fit for angels living there.
1030,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"So ""farewell,"" says merry England, ""farewell"" says each green isle,"
1031,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"""And blessings for this noble ship on her initial trial,"

1035,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"O there were pleasant partings as the vessel sail'd away,"
1036,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And there was joy in every heart that pleasant April day,"
1037,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And there were happy thoughts of home--of meeting kith and kin,"
1038,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,For the stately vessel soon would be her harbor safe within.
1039,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1040,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And so blue the sky above them and so blue the wave beneath,"
1041,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"That all,--all thought of living and no one thought of death,"
1042,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"As, hour by hour, the vessel left England far behind,"
1043,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And, hour by hour, the ship sped on as speeds an ocean wind."
1044,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1045,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And when night came, with fond good-nights the floating city slept,"

1050,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1051,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Then there was breaking timbers, and bulging plates of steel,"
1052,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And noise of great commotion along that vessel's keel--
1053,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Then there were cries of anguish, and curses from rough men,"
1054,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And earnest prayers for safety--O prayers for safety then.
1055,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1056,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"For women wept in terror, and stout men drop'd a tear,"
1057,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And the shouting and the tumult was maddening to hear,"
1058,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Yet there amidst that seething the life-boats, one by one,"
1059,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Were set adrift at midnight--where cold sea-rivers run.
1060,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1061,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Then, on that fated vessel, the thousand waited there"
1062,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"In hope some sea-born sister would snatch them from despair,"
1063,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"But no ship came to aid her, and, in the dead of night,"

1066,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"O midway in old ocean, in her darkest, deepest gloom,"
1067,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"A thousand brave hearts bravely went down to meet their doom,--"
1068,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And what a tragic picture!--Oh, what a solemn sight"
1069,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,Upon that fated vessel with the stars still shining bright!
1070,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1071,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Then there was time for thinking--O time enough to spare,"
1072,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And there was time for cursing and time enough for pray'r,--"
1073,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Time,--time for retrospection, and time enough to die,"
1074,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Time, time for life's great tragedy--and time to reason why."
1075,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1076,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,That was the greatest battle that ever yet was fought;
1077,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,That was the greatest picture on any canvas wrought;
1078,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,That was the greatest lesson that mortal man can teach;
1079,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,That was the greatest sermon that priests of earth can preach.
1080,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1081,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Yet no one fought that battle with saber or with gun,"
1082,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And no one saw that picture, save those brave hearts alone,"
1083,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And no one read that lesson there written in the dark,"
1084,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,And no one heard that sermon that went straight to its mark.
1085,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1086,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Nor shall we know their story, the saddest of the sea,"
1087,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"Or shall we learn the sequel, the sorrow yet to be,"
1088,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,But long shall we remember how brave men bravely died
1089,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"For some poor, lowly woman with a baby at her side."
1090,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,
1091,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"And when the world gets scorning the greatest of the great,"
1092,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"When poverty sits cursing the man of large estate,"
1093,THE SINKING OF THE TITANIC,"O then let men remember, how, in that awful hour,"
