107,PRELUDE,
108,PRELUDE,
109,PRELUDE,I am a little tired of all things mortal;
110,PRELUDE,I see through half-shut eyelids languorous
111,PRELUDE,The old monotonous
112,PRELUDE,"Gold sun set slowly through the western portal,"
113,PRELUDE,"Where I recline upon my deep dîwân,"
114,PRELUDE,In Ispahân.
115,PRELUDE,
116,PRELUDE,I am a little weary of the Persian
117,PRELUDE,Girl that I lov'd; I am quite tir'd of love;
118,PRELUDE,And I am weary of
119,PRELUDE,"The smoking censers, and the sweet diversion"
120,PRELUDE,"Of stroking Leila's jasmine-scented hair,"
121,PRELUDE,I thought so fair.
122,PRELUDE,
123,PRELUDE,At last I think I am quite tired of beauty;
124,PRELUDE,Why do the stars shine always in the sky?
125,PRELUDE,"I think if I might die,"
126,PRELUDE,"Something more sweet, less tiring than the duty"
127,PRELUDE,"Of kissing her, might be; I am tired of myrrh,"
128,PRELUDE,And kissing her.
129,PRELUDE,
130,PRELUDE,"Khaled, come, come, and slowly move the scented"
131,PRELUDE,Gold narghilé away; let the lyres cease.
132,PRELUDE,And now a little peace!
133,PRELUDE,"For see, moon-faced Leila hath repented"
134,PRELUDE,"Of singing Hafiz' songs melodiously,"
135,PRELUDE,And languidly.
136,PRELUDE,
137,PRELUDE,"Surely all things are vain, and great thanksgiving"
138,PRELUDE,Is due not; surely all things now are vain;
139,PRELUDE,And all my heart is fain
140,PRELUDE,"Of something, something, far too great for living;"
141,PRELUDE,"Nothing is very sad, nor wonderful,"
142,PRELUDE,Nor beautiful.
143,PRELUDE,
144,PRELUDE,"Well now, since all things are not worth the winning,"
145,PRELUDE,Goodbye! With these I have a little play'd;
146,PRELUDE,"And once, alas, I pray'd"
147,PRELUDE,"That gorgeous, golden sins be mine for sinning;"
148,PRELUDE,But now I would not leave my palanquin
149,PRELUDE,For any sin.
150,PRELUDE,
151,PRELUDE,And long ago I prov'd in great compassion
152,PRELUDE,"For man, that Brahm is not nor ever was;"
153,PRELUDE,"But now, alas, alas"
154,PRELUDE,
155,PRELUDE,"I would he were, that in the olden fashion"
156,PRELUDE,I might laugh once again ere all is said;
157,PRELUDE,But Brahm is dead.
158,PRELUDE,
159,PRELUDE,Then with philosophy I bor'd me duly;
160,PRELUDE,"And since I could not slumber all the time,"
161,PRELUDE,"I, in sweet golden rhyme,"
162,PRELUDE,On white papyrus scented with patchouli
163,PRELUDE,Wrote masterpieces starry-beautiful.
164,PRELUDE,The earth was full.
165,PRELUDE,
166,PRELUDE,So beauty wearied me; in order slowly
167,PRELUDE,"Love, Joy, and Victory came unto me;"
168,PRELUDE,I kiss'd them languidly;
169,PRELUDE,"And Virtue came, and Duty, stiff and holy;"
170,PRELUDE,To these I said--Pray come another day;
171,PRELUDE,And turn'd away.
172,PRELUDE,
173,PRELUDE,"Now since of all I am a little weary,"
174,PRELUDE,"And since on earth I must a while sojourn,"
175,PRELUDE,And since a while must burn
176,PRELUDE,"The censer of my long existence dreary,"
177,PRELUDE,"All things shall walk, that own my mastery,"
178,PRELUDE,In luxury.
179,PRELUDE,
180,PRELUDE,"My Ennui shall in vestments falling lowly,"
181,PRELUDE,"Stiff, purple, trailing, long, episcopal"
182,PRELUDE,"Sweep through her palace hall,"
183,PRELUDE,Like to a consecrated bishop holy;
184,PRELUDE,My Sin from golden goblets of Byzant
185,PRELUDE,Shall drink absinthe.
186,PRELUDE,
187,PRELUDE,"And my gold-crowned wanton goddess Pleasure,"
188,PRELUDE,(My candles are all burning at her shrine)
189,PRELUDE,"Shall be made drunk with wine,"
190,PRELUDE,And walk unto the velvet-falling measure
191,PRELUDE,"Of golden-voiced, solemn-sounding shawms."
192,PRELUDE,No rhyme for shawms.
193,PRELUDE,
194,PRELUDE,"All they that wait upon me in my glory,"
195,PRELUDE,"My purple Pride, and my Luxuriousness,"
196,PRELUDE,"And my Voluptuousness,"
197,PRELUDE,Shall show within their faces transitory
198,PRELUDE,"Something more subtile than all life can give,"
199,PRELUDE,While I shall live....
200,PRELUDE,
201,PRELUDE,"Ah, all is liv'd, all eaten, all is drunken!"
202,PRELUDE,"Soul, is there anything now left for thee"
203,PRELUDE,Excepting sanctity?
204,PRELUDE,
205,PRELUDE,"Nay, ev'n we too have been in virtue sunken,"
206,PRELUDE,"We have been holy priest, we have confess'd,"
207,PRELUDE,"Said, Missa Est."
208,PRELUDE,
209,PRELUDE,"I have drunk out of heavy goblets golden,"
210,PRELUDE,As from some hellish tabernaculum
211,PRELUDE,"Cannabis, conium;"
212,PRELUDE,"I know quite all the poisons, all the olden"
213,PRELUDE,"Sins, all the ténébreux dark secrets hid,"
214,PRELUDE,And things forbid.
215,PRELUDE,
216,PRELUDE,"I have had all things unto mortals given,"
217,PRELUDE,"I all the women, all the passion I,"
218,PRELUDE,All the satiety;
219,PRELUDE,"I have had all the pleasures known in heaven,"
220,PRELUDE,"Paradisiacal, purpureal,"
221,PRELUDE,Exstatical.
222,PRELUDE,
223,PRELUDE,"With all the sciences I am acquainted,"
224,PRELUDE,"Alas! I know quite all the languages,"
225,PRELUDE,"All the philosophies,"
226,PRELUDE,"Alas! and all the pictures that are painted,"
227,PRELUDE,And all the palac'd capitals that be
228,PRELUDE,Have wearied me.
229,PRELUDE,
230,PRELUDE,"Alas, all art, all knowledge, and all passion"
231,PRELUDE,I have had: I have heard all the symphonies;
232,PRELUDE,I have sail'd all the seas;
233,PRELUDE,I have drain'd all life's cup in languid fashion;
234,PRELUDE,"And I am come to Persia again,"
235,PRELUDE,Land of cocagne.

250,ASHTORETH,In thy blue pallid gown that shimmereth
251,ASHTORETH,"So pale thou standest in the wan moonlight,"
252,ASHTORETH,Where the gold censer near thy body white
253,ASHTORETH,Wraps thee around with its perfumed breath;
254,ASHTORETH,
255,ASHTORETH,So wan thy high tiara glimmereth
256,ASHTORETH,"Above thy mystical far eyes of light,"
257,ASHTORETH,"Thou seemest some dead goddess of the night,"
258,ASHTORETH,"O starry love, O changeless Ashtoreth."
259,ASHTORETH,
260,ASHTORETH,"Pallid thou standest in thy divinity,"
261,ASHTORETH,"Like some moon-idol of the buried time,"
262,ASHTORETH,Before whose face priests sing in solemn chime.
263,ASHTORETH,
264,ASHTORETH,"So I prostrate before thy deity,"
265,ASHTORETH,"Unto thy face have solemn praises sung,"

275,PARFAIT AMOUR,"As dying sunsets are,"
276,PARFAIT AMOUR,Nor that thy lovely eyelids wear
277,PARFAIT AMOUR,The splendour of a star;
278,PARFAIT AMOUR,Tis the deep sadness of thine eyes
279,PARFAIT AMOUR,"Hath my heart captive led,"
280,PARFAIT AMOUR,And that within thy soul I prize
281,PARFAIT AMOUR,The calmness of the dead.
282,PARFAIT AMOUR,
283,PARFAIT AMOUR,"O holy love, O fair white face,"
284,PARFAIT AMOUR,O sweet lost soul of thine!
285,PARFAIT AMOUR,"Thy bosom is an altar-place,"
286,PARFAIT AMOUR,Thy kisses holy wine;
287,PARFAIT AMOUR,Sweet incense offer'd for my bliss
288,PARFAIT AMOUR,"Is thy corrupted breath,"
289,PARFAIT AMOUR,And on thy stained lips I kiss
290,PARFAIT AMOUR,The holy lips of Death!
291,PARFAIT AMOUR,
292,PARFAIT AMOUR,Wherefore because thy heart is all
293,PARFAIT AMOUR,"Fill'd full of mournfulness,"
294,PARFAIT AMOUR,And thy gold head as with a pall
295,PARFAIT AMOUR,Hung o'er with sinfulness;
296,PARFAIT AMOUR,Because thy soul is utterly
297,PARFAIT AMOUR,Sinful unto the core--
298,PARFAIT AMOUR,"Therefore my heart is bound to thee,"

310,OPIUM,
311,OPIUM,O where the air winds its myrrh-scented steam
312,OPIUM,"About thy naked body's disarray,"

314,OPIUM,Born and forgot in the dead ages gray?

383,ENNUI,"Came in and knelt: one old, and weak, and gray,"

725,BALLAD,"Through the leafy woods funereal,"
726,BALLAD,And all the length of her moonlit way
727,BALLAD,Was wanly white as the light of day;
728,BALLAD,"Solemnly rob'd she rode along,"
729,BALLAD,Unmindful of their droning throng
730,BALLAD,"That throng'd her shadowy path, alas,"
731,BALLAD,As though to see her funeral pass;
732,BALLAD,So through the mournful forest slow
733,BALLAD,"Her palfrey's silken feet did go,"
734,BALLAD,Bearing her solemnly like a god
735,BALLAD,Over the shadow-haunted sod;
736,BALLAD,She laught to see the dead desire
737,BALLAD,"That even now her life should tire,"
738,BALLAD,She laught to think that to the earth
739,BALLAD,"They call'd her that was full of mirth,"

741,BALLAD,Throng'd the wan legions of the dead
742,BALLAD,"Wanly attempting to stop her way,"

745,BALLAD,Under the far gaze of the moon.
746,BALLAD,Then out from the dying woods at last
747,BALLAD,Into the moonlit plain she passt;
748,BALLAD,The misty stars were almost dead
749,BALLAD,"Sunk in the heavens overhead,"
750,BALLAD,While low down in the solemn skies
751,BALLAD,The white moon wan'd as one that dies.
752,BALLAD,Solemnly through the misty air
753,BALLAD,She rode with gold gems in her hair;
754,BALLAD,"Bright were her holy eyes divine,"
755,BALLAD,And red her lips as the red red wine.
756,BALLAD,At last in the unceasing night
757,BALLAD,Down from her palfrey she doth alight
758,BALLAD,By the strange murmuring of the sea;
759,BALLAD,"She climbs the tall stair fearlessly,"
760,BALLAD,And cometh at last to her chamber high
761,BALLAD,Beneath the wide face of the sky.
762,BALLAD,"At last her journey being done,"
763,BALLAD,"She hath her golden stays undone,"
764,BALLAD,"And being a little wearied,"

2239,I,"Sat solitary as who would fain divine,"
2240,I,Of seeing and of hearing ill content;
2241,I,"With these I sat, half drunken with the vine,"
2242,I,And sick of visions that aye came and went;
2243,I,But all the knowledge that their striving found
2244,I,Was but one vision more than wine had sent;
2245,I,All these also shall moulder in the ground.
2246,I,From these I past as from dead flesh and bones.
2247,I,Then came I where the kings of earth sat crown'd
2248,I,Neath purple canopies on golden thrones;
2249,I,"These offer'd me part in that changeless state,"
2250,I,Until my soul wearied of brass and bronze.
2251,I,Others whose sweating nothing could abate
2252,I,"Kingdoms and cities build and overthrow,"
2253,I,Till my soul wonder'd at the striving great
2254,I,Of all the puppets in that puppet-show:
2255,I,"--Doth the string move them with such urgency,"
2256,I,That all their limbs such strange grimaces show?
2257,I,"--These are all they that do, one made reply;"

2266,I,"And some stood round with faces that implore,"

2268,I,Did but like these delude themselves the more;
2269,I,But rottenness shall stop all these that rave.
2270,I,"Last, some there were that did with vanity"
2271,I,Toil ever with unwearied hands to save
2272,I,And to eternize all things great and high;
2273,I,"With these I stay'd, till my heart questioned:"
2274,I,--What are the things thou doëst here and why?
2275,I,Whereat all these became as persons dead.

2284,I,"And is this all the meaning of that throng,"

2291,I,For pride; nor in them that in gladness sate;
2292,I,Wherefore with none of these shall I abide.
2293,I,The sought is vanity; the seeking great
2294,I,Vanity; the not-seeking vanity;
2295,I,For none of these change I my solemn state.
2296,I,
2297,II,II
2298,II,
2299,II,Then since no one could answer unto me
2300,II,"The question, and since no one could me tell"
2301,II,The wherefore of this endless Vanity
2302,II,"Of all the spirits that on earth did dwell,"
2303,II,I said--I go unto the Absolute;
2304,II,He will perchance release me from this hell.
2305,II,Him that made noisy what before was mute
2306,II,I found upon a heap of filthy dung
2307,II,Low-sitting in the fashion of the brute.
2308,II,"In strange grimaces still his face he wrung,"
2309,II,"Up to the chin within that filth immerst,"
2310,II,Which still his busy hands about him flung.
2311,II,--Do thou those clothes wherein he is inhearst
2312,II,"Take off, said I to one, and do not shirk."
2313,II,"He did, while still that being howl'd and curst,"
2314,II,"For there so thick and muddy was the murk,"
2315,II,"And he still bore of clothes so thick a weight,"
2316,II,I knew not well what thing therein did lurk.
2317,II,Three coverings then that one removed straight--
2318,II,"Omniscience, Omnipresence, Omnipotence,"
2319,II,From off the thing that in the ordure sate.
2320,II,"Then did his truth show clear to every sense,"
2321,II,"A filthy idiot so foul and low,"
2322,II,That decency the perfect tale prevents.
2323,II,And I--O thou whose nakedness doth show
2324,II,"Like one not in the womb to fulness brought,"
2325,II,Why are all things that are; if thou dost know?
2326,II,Then he replied from out the ordure hot:
2327,II,"--Brahma, great Brahma, Everlasting, I!"
2328,II,And I--Not such reply my question sought.
2329,II,Answer thou me! And he still made reply:
2330,II,"--Brahma, great Brahma! repetition vain."
2331,II,I asked again: and--Brahma! he did cry.
2332,II,Then one thereby to me--Why art thou fain
2333,II,"Knowledge to have from It? It knows not, It;"
2334,II,Why seek for truth among the low insane?
2335,II,Then he that did within the ordure sit
2336,II,Out of the filth that lay about his feet
2337,II,Such things as children make with little wit
2338,II,"Made, and then broke, and did the act repeat."
2339,II,"--I have made all the worlds, he gibbered;"
2340,II,And I his labour with these words did greet.
2341,II,"--Why dost thou these things? why, O why? I said."
2342,II,"No word vouchsaf'd the mouth of him that stank,"
2343,II,But giggling sounds and idiot uttered.
2344,II,"Then seated in that place of ordure rank,"
2345,II,"With his two lips he made a cackling sound,"
2346,II,And back within the friendly ordure sank.
2347,II,Then I with a great sad and awful voice
2348,II,"Cried out--O thou that rottest in this sty,"
2349,II,"O thou whose soul in ordure doth rejoice,"
2350,II,What art thou doing these things for and why?
2351,II,Then one to me--His bliss is not to know
2352,II,The infiniteness of his own Vanity;
2353,II,"Therefore the soul of him that stinketh so,"
2354,II,Because his sense is blind and deaf and mad
2355,II,"Forever, knoweth not eternal woe."
2356,II,Lo from the first his soul no reason had;
2357,II,"He thinketh he himself is everything,"
2358,II,And nothing is but him! He is not sad.
2359,II,"Ignorance, ignorance, shrouds him like a pall;"
2360,II,Therefore thus low upon the fetid floor
2361,II,"He sits, and knoweth naught outside his stall."
2362,II,And I--He maketh naught outside his store.
2363,II,Why doth he this? and in this fetid tomb
2364,II,Sitteth he here in madness evermore?
2365,II,"How long shall iron, awful, gnashing doom"
2366,II,Leave him thus naked old and idiot
2367,II,"Blind deaf and stinking, in the loathed gloom"
2368,II,How long shall This within the ordure squat?
2369,II,How long shall This cease not to beck and nod
2370,II,How long shall This cease not to rot and rot?
2371,II,And he--This rottenness that seemeth God
2372,II,More woe than this nor any other mode
2373,II,"Shall know not, till It ceaseth in the sod."
2374,II,"And as a gnat, a viper, or a toad,"
2375,II,"Because its nature is not infinite,"
2376,II,It too shall perish in the worm's abode;
2377,II,Till then It suppurateth in the night.
2378,II,
2379,III,III
2380,III,
2381,III,Then from the world I turn'd my steps afar;
2382,III,I came there where the holy Trinity
2383,III,"And all the blessed saints in glory are,"
2384,III,"And did the beatific vision see,"
2385,III,And how those happy are that once did mourn;
2386,III,But my heart said--All this is naught to me;
2387,III,Nor knew I why all these should be reborn.
2388,III,Where moon-fac'd houris wanton arms do fling
2389,III,"Round Mahmud's blessed, I past by in scorn,"
2390,III,For my heart dream'd a deeper revelling.
2391,III,Then came I to that banquet more divine
2392,III,That Jayadeva and that Jami sing;
2393,III,And the fair goblet fill'd full of the wine
2394,III,Brought the cup-bearer clad with wantonness;
2395,III,And there with the beloved and the vine
2396,III,My heart grew weary of that blessedness.
2397,III,"From life I past, finding no joy therein."
2398,III,The vision and the vine and drunkenness
2399,III,Still like a circle ever closing in.
2400,III,"Then I departed to the final peace,"
2401,III,"Sick of what is and shall be and hath been,"
2402,III,"Of Brahma, as the drop sinks in the seas:"
2403,III,"I past out from the bonds of thee-and-me,"
2404,III,Lost in that Infinite whose being is
2405,III,Glory in all things and reality;
2406,III,"But therein I that was not I, alas"
2407,III,In that deliverance from me-and-thee
2408,III,"Where all illusion fadeth like to grass,"
2409,III,Found naught that equall'd my undimm'd desire;
2410,III,"--If that reality then real was,"
2411,III,What is that real more than trodden mire?
2412,III,"Then from all being did my spirit pass,"
2413,III,Sick of all being whether low or higher.
2414,III,Out of that circle unto nothingness
2415,III,"I came, unto Nirvana, the far goal"
2416,III,"Of many a holy saint, where visions cease;"
2417,III,But nothingness did not my heart console.
2418,III,"Ah not in nothingness is any peace,"
2419,III,"Nor in peace any peace, nor in the whole,"
2420,III,"Nor in the vine nor in the vision, nor"
2421,III,"In being nor non-being, nor in all"
2422,III,That man hath dream'd of and hath anguisht for.
2423,III,"Nay not in joy nor the vine jovial,"
2424,III,"Nor in the perfume of the lov'd one's breath,"
2425,III,Nay nor in anything anywhere at all;
2426,III,Nor in illusion; nor what sundereth
2427,III,Illusion; in the sundering of that chain
2428,III,There is no joy; and not alas in death
2429,III,Find I that thing whereof my soul is fain.
2430,III,All these things also are all vanity
2431,III,No less than sun and stars that wax and wane
2432,III,Forever in the everlasting sky.

2445,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,All my life's hopes are gone tombwards to die.
2446,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,All my life's glories lie perisht around me; and lo with great laughing
2447,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Laugh I out loud, and I care not at all;"
2448,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Here with mine Anguish, my Sorrow, my Madness, my Grief, I sit quaffing"
2449,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Wine, in high state in my echoing hall."
2450,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"This is the last night I drink with you, maniac wassailers dreary!"
2451,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Lift up your goblets and drink ere I go!
2452,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Lo, I am easily bor'd, I am easily tired and made weary;"
2453,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Now at the last I am weary of Woe.
2454,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Lo, I that walk in the flower crown'd season of youthfulness golden,"
2455,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Think ye that all things my gladness can slay?
2456,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Sorrow is fitting for dotards and them that are loathsome and olden;
2457,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,_I_ am as one that goes ever away.
2458,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Lo, I laugh out at Grief, lo, I laugh in unending rejoicing,"
2459,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,I that have nightshade entwin'd in my hair;
2460,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Heart of me, what dost thou here in the wearisome darkness, revoicing"
2461,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Yesterday's stale and forgotten despair?
2462,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Now it is midnight; but soon shall the wakening glory of morning
2463,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Shine in the East, when the darkness is gone;"
2464,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Now in my spirit that sat for a time in the darkness of mourning
2465,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Waketh in gladness the mystical dawn.
2466,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,New spring laugheth without--to thy heart it is calling! and o'er thee
2467,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Soon shall the banners of dawn be unfurl'd;
2468,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Wait thou no longer, O heart, O heart that art strong, for before thee"
2469,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,Lieth the pomp of the great high world!
2470,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Now it is midnight; my Anguish, my Mourning, my Sadness, my Sorrow,"
2471,AT THE END OF THE CENTURY,"Crown you with nightshade, and once more with me"

2486,SONG OF INDIA,
2487,SONG OF INDIA,
2488,SONG OF INDIA,"Now at the last, Zulaikha, all my sorrows olden"
2489,SONG OF INDIA,"Are farther off than Europe or than China seem,"
2490,SONG OF INDIA,And like an idle dream
2491,SONG OF INDIA,The North is faded far off in the distance golden;
2492,SONG OF INDIA,And here with thee I sit in perfect peace enfolden
2493,SONG OF INDIA,Beside the Ganges-stream.
2494,SONG OF INDIA,
2495,SONG OF INDIA,Full well I knew that ne'er those northern promontories
2496,SONG OF INDIA,Could give to me the dream that did my soul desire;
2497,SONG OF INDIA,For there my heart did tire;
2498,SONG OF INDIA,For always me allur'd the strangely whisper'd stories
2499,SONG OF INDIA,"Of skies that burn with more consuming languid glories,"
2500,SONG OF INDIA,And suns of mightier fire.
2501,SONG OF INDIA,
2502,SONG OF INDIA,"I dream'd of heavier suns than burn in skies of ours,"
2503,SONG OF INDIA,And heavier airs that through the long long evening swoon
2504,SONG OF INDIA,"Under a larger moon,"
2505,SONG OF INDIA,"And heavier-scented gardens fill'd with stranger flowers,"
2506,SONG OF INDIA,And tropic palms that wave through all the long long hours
2507,SONG OF INDIA,Of endless afternoon.
2508,SONG OF INDIA,
2509,SONG OF INDIA,"At last now from that northern dream am I awoken,"
2510,SONG OF INDIA,At last I am come home over the watery main;
2511,SONG OF INDIA,Long long I sigh'd in vain;
2512,SONG OF INDIA,"Now under tropic palms I lie in peace unbroken,"
2513,SONG OF INDIA,"And mine own land I see, beloved, and hear spoken"
2514,SONG OF INDIA,My natal tongue again.
2515,SONG OF INDIA,
2516,SONG OF INDIA,"Zulaikha, past is all the longing and endeavour;"
2517,SONG OF INDIA,"The palm-trees sleep, and sleeping move not any leaf;"
2518,SONG OF INDIA,Perisht is woe and grief;
2519,SONG OF INDIA,Stilly the padmas float upon the holy river;
2520,SONG OF INDIA,Among all these we two with languid eyes forever
2521,SONG OF INDIA,Lie sunk in endless kief.
2522,SONG OF INDIA,
2523,SONG OF INDIA,Before us riseth white our marble-builded palace;
2524,SONG OF INDIA,Thou hast let fall from out thy hands that weary are
2525,SONG OF INDIA,The volume of Attár.
2526,SONG OF INDIA,Thy hand hath spill'd the wine within the silver chalice;
2527,SONG OF INDIA,Upon the river winding through the distant valleys
2528,SONG OF INDIA,Sleepeth the nénufar.
2529,SONG OF INDIA,
2530,SONG OF INDIA,"From out the oleanders languid slumber steepeth,"
2531,SONG OF INDIA,"And thou, Zulaihka, dost, in rest too deep for dream,"
2532,SONG OF INDIA,Like one enchanted seem;
2533,SONG OF INDIA,"Thy beauty now in waking slumber sunken sleepeth,"
2534,SONG OF INDIA,And dreaming past thy wholly closed eyelids creepeth
2535,SONG OF INDIA,The sleepy-flowing stream.
2536,SONG OF INDIA,
2537,SONG OF INDIA,"Thou hast the light of Asia in thy face divinest,"
2538,SONG OF INDIA,"And in thy scented mouth and in thy lotus-eyes,"
2539,SONG OF INDIA,O wine of Paradise!
2540,SONG OF INDIA,"O moon-fac'd love that by the sacred stream reclinest,"
2541,SONG OF INDIA,Hath this world anything for which in vain thou pinest?
2542,SONG OF INDIA,That thing shall be thy prize.
2543,SONG OF INDIA,
2544,SONG OF INDIA,"The caravans that in the desert, heavy-laden,"
2545,SONG OF INDIA,"By unknown oases pitch their sun-blacken'd tents,"
2546,SONG OF INDIA,Shall bring thee all sweet scents
2547,SONG OF INDIA,Wherein delight in heaven the houris ever-maiden--
2548,SONG OF INDIA,"Patchouli, nard, and myrrh, from many a distant aden"
2549,SONG OF INDIA,Of heavenly indolence.
2550,SONG OF INDIA,
2551,SONG OF INDIA,"All kinds of gems wherefore thine almond eyes have yearning,"
2552,SONG OF INDIA,"In heaps, wherein to bathe thy beauties languorous,"
2553,SONG OF INDIA,"O maiden amorous,"
2554,SONG OF INDIA,They shall bring home to thee from distant isles returning--
2555,SONG OF INDIA,"Pearl, sapphire, diamond, topaz, and ruby burning,"
2556,SONG OF INDIA,And opal luminous.
2557,SONG OF INDIA,
2558,SONG OF INDIA,"Thou art that sweet whereof all poets dead have chaunted,"
2559,SONG OF INDIA,"Therefore my soul hath sought thy face o'er pathless seas,"
2560,SONG OF INDIA,Here to have endless peace;
2561,SONG OF INDIA,"Thou art the garden of delight with slumber haunted,"
2562,SONG OF INDIA,"Thy perfume maketh dream of desert lands enchaunted,"
2563,SONG OF INDIA,And far-off oases.
2564,SONG OF INDIA,
2565,SONG OF INDIA,Thou hast that beauty in thine all-consuming glances
2566,SONG OF INDIA,"That openeth the ways to far enchanted skies,"
2567,SONG OF INDIA,And in thy lotus-eyes
2568,SONG OF INDIA,Thou hast the light that shineth in the countenances
2569,SONG OF INDIA,Of them whose eyes have seen the glory which entrances
2570,SONG OF INDIA,The blest of Paradise.
2571,SONG OF INDIA,
2572,SONG OF INDIA,"Thou art all sweets that unto perfect joy devote us,"
2573,SONG OF INDIA,"In thee all spices and all scents together come,"
2574,SONG OF INDIA,O lute that now art dumb!
2575,SONG OF INDIA,"Thou art musk, frankincense, amomum, stephanotis,"
2576,SONG OF INDIA,"Thou art the fragrant wine, the paradisal lotus,"
2577,SONG OF INDIA,Thou art the opium.
2578,SONG OF INDIA,
2579,SONG OF INDIA,"Hashsheesh nor opium are worth not thy caresses,"
2580,SONG OF INDIA,Sweeter than opium to still the spirit's drouth
2581,SONG OF INDIA,Thine unassuaged mouth;
2582,SONG OF INDIA,Him that hath known thy love no mortal grief distresses;
2583,SONG OF INDIA,Sweeter thy kisses are than incense which oppresses
2584,SONG OF INDIA,The breezes of the South....
2585,SONG OF INDIA,
2586,SONG OF INDIA,"At last I am come home, come home; and all regretting"
2587,SONG OF INDIA,Is with the North afar from thee and me away.
2588,SONG OF INDIA,"Behold O love, the day"
2589,SONG OF INDIA,"Is past, in Indian skies the holy sun is setting;"
2590,SONG OF INDIA,"The mûzin from his tower calleth unforgetting,"
2591,SONG OF INDIA,The faithful ones to pray.
2592,SONG OF INDIA,
2593,SONG OF INDIA,Under the velvet night wide India reposes
2594,SONG OF INDIA,Now in the scented dark the champak odours swoon;
2595,SONG OF INDIA,Slowly the summer moon
2596,SONG OF INDIA,Riseth into the azure night made drunk with roses;
2597,SONG OF INDIA,"And lo the camel-bells, now that the daylight closes,"
2598,SONG OF INDIA,Tinkle their quiet tune.
2599,SONG OF INDIA,
2600,SONG OF INDIA,"Behold, O well-beloved, 'neath the moonlight gleaming"
2601,SONG OF INDIA,"The travellers depart from out the sleeping khan,"
2602,SONG OF INDIA,O perfume Asian!
2603,SONG OF INDIA,"And past the moonlit palace, where we two lie dreaming,"
2604,SONG OF INDIA,With camels and with horsemen like to shadows seeming
2605,SONG OF INDIA,Departs the caravan.
2606,SONG OF INDIA,
2607,SONG OF INDIA,"It is the starting hour, O most melancholy!"
2608,SONG OF INDIA,"In long procession underneath the moon's pale gleams,"
2609,SONG OF INDIA,"Like something that but seems,"
2610,SONG OF INDIA,"The caravan departeth to the desert slowly,"
2611,SONG OF INDIA,There far afar to seek through endless time the holy
2612,SONG OF INDIA,Mirages of their dreams.
