143,,Introduction by William Archer
144,,
145,,"This book contains the undesigned, but all the more spontaneous and authentic,"
146,,"biography of a very rare spirit.  It contains the record of a short life,"
147,,into which was crowded far more of keen experience and high aspiration--of
148,,the thrill of sense and the rapture of soul--than it is given to
149,,"most men, even of high vitality, to extract from a life of twice the length."
150,,"Alan Seeger had barely passed his twenty-eighth birthday, when,"
151,,"charging up to the German trenches on the field of Belloy-en-Santerre,"
152,,"his ""escouade"" of the Foreign Legion was caught in a deadly flurry"
153,,"of machine-gun fire, and he fell, with most of his comrades,"
154,,on the blood-stained but reconquered soil.  To his friends
155,,"the loss was grievous, to literature it was--we shall never know how great,"
156,,"but assuredly not small.  Yet this was a case, if ever there was one,"
157,,"in which we may not only say ""Nothing is here for tears,"""
158,,but may add to the well-worn phrase its less familiar sequel:
159,,
160,,Nothing to wail
161,,"Or knock the breast, no weakness, no contempt,"
162,,"Dispraise, or blame,--nothing but well and fair,"
163,,And what may quiet us in a death so noble.
164,,
165,,"Of all the poets who have died young, none has died so happily."
166,,"Without suggesting any parity of stature, one cannot but think"
167,,"of the group of English poets who, about a hundred years ago,"
168,,"were cut off in the flower of their age.  Keats, coughing out his soul"
169,,by the Spanish Steps; Shelley's spirit of flame snuffed out
170,,by a chance capful of wind from the hills of Carrara;
171,,"Byron, stung by a fever-gnat on the very threshold of his great"
172,,adventure--for all these we can feel nothing but poignant unrelieved regret.
173,,"Alan Seeger, on the other hand, we can very truly envy.  Youth had given him"
174,,all that it had to give; and though he would fain have lived
175,,on--though no one was ever less world-weary than he--yet in the plenitude
176,,"of his exultant strength, with eye undimmed and pulse unslackening,"
177,,"he met the death he had voluntarily challenged, in the cause"
178,,"of the land he loved, and in the moment of victory.  Again and again,"
179,,"both in prose and in verse, he had said that this seemed to him"
180,,a good death to die; and two years of unflinching endurance
181,,of self-imposed hardship and danger had proved that he meant what he said.
182,,
183,,"I do not, I repeat, pretend to measure him with Shelley, Byron or Keats,"
184,,though I think none of them would have disdained his gift of song.
185,,"But assuredly he is of their fellowship in virtue,"
186,,"not only of his early death, but of his whole-hearted devotion"
187,,"to the spirit of Romance, as they understood it.  From his boyhood upward,"
188,,his one passion was for beauty; and it was in the guise of Romance
189,,that beauty revealed itself to him.  He was from the first determined
190,,"not only to write but to live Romance, and when fate threw in his way"
191,,"a world-historic opportunity, he seized it with delight."
192,,"He knew that he was dicing with Death, but that was the very essence"
193,,"of his ideal; and he knew that if Death won the throw,"
194,,"his ideal was crowned and consummated, for ever safe"
195,,"from the withering touch of time, or accidental soilure."
196,,"If it had been given to Swinburne to fall, rifle in hand,"
197,,"on, say, the field of Mentana, we should have been the poorer"
198,,"by many splendid verses, but the richer by a heroic life-story."
199,,"And would his lot have been the less enviable?  Nay, surely, much the more."
200,,That is the thought which may well bring solace to those
201,,"who loved Alan Seeger, and who may at first have felt as an unmixed cruelty"
202,,"the cutting short of so eager, so generous, so gallant a life."
203,,
204,,"The description ""Juvenilia"" attached to the first series of these poems"
205,,is of his own choosing.  It is for the reader to judge
206,,"what allowance is to be made for unripeness, whether of substance or of form."
207,,Criticism is none of my present business.  But I think no discerning reader
208,,can fail to be impressed by one great virtue pervading all the poet's
209,,"work--its absolute sincerity.  There is no pose, no affectation of any sort."
210,,"There are marks of the loving study of other poets, and these the best."
211,,We are frequently reminded of this singer and of that.  The young American
212,,is instinctively loyal to the long tradition of English literature.
213,,"He is content to undergo the influence of the great masters,"
214,,and does not seek for premature originality on the by-paths of eccentricity.
215,,"But while he is the disciple of many, he is the vassal of none."
216,,"His matter is always his own, the fruit of personal vision, experience,"
217,,"imagination, even if he may now and then unconsciously pour it into a mould"
218,,"provided by another.  He is no mere echo of the rhythms of this poet,"
219,,or mimic of that other's attitude and outlook.  The great zest of living
220,,which inspires him is far too real and intense to clothe itself
221,,in the trappings of any alien individuality.  He is too straightforward
222,,"to be even dramatic.  It is not his instinct to put on a mask,"
223,,"even for purposes of artistic personation, and much less of affectation."
224,,
225,,"If ever there was a being who said ""Yea"" to life, accepted it"
226,,"as a glorious gift, and was determined to live it with all his might,"
227,,it was Alan Seeger.  Such a frame of mind is too instinctive and temperamental
228,,"to be called optimism.  It is not the result of a balancing of good and ill,"
229,,and a reasoned decision that good preponderates.  Rather it is
230,,"a direct perception, an intuition, of the beauty and wonder of the"
231,,universe--an intuition too overpowering to be seriously disturbed
232,,"by the existence of pain and evil, some of which, at any rate,"
233,,"has its value as a foil, a background, to joy.  This was the message--not"
234,,a philosophy but an irresistible emotion--which he sought to deliver
235,,through the medium of an art which he seriously studied and deeply loved.
236,,"It spoke from the very depths of his being, and the poems in which"
237,,"it found utterance, whatever their purely literary qualities,"
238,,"have at least the value of a first-hand human document,"
239,,the sincere self-portraiture of a vivid and virile soul.
240,,
241,,There are three more or less clearly-marked elements in a poet's
242,,"equipment--observation, passion, reflection, or in simpler terms,"
243,,"seeing, feeling and thinking.  The first two are richly represented"
244,,"in the following poems, the third, as was natural, much less so."
245,,The poet was too fully occupied in garnering impressions and experiences
246,,to think of co-ordinating and interpreting them.  That would have come later;
247,,"and later, too, would have come a general deepening of the spiritual content"
248,,of his work.  There had been nothing in either his outward or his inward life
249,,that could fairly be called suffering or struggle.  He had not sounded
250,,"the depths of human experience, which is as much as to say that"
251,,"neither had he risen to the heights.  This he no doubt recognised himself,"
252,,and was not thinking merely of the date of composition
253,,"when he called his pre-war poems ""Juvenilia"".  Great emotions,"
254,,"and perhaps great sorrows, would have come to him in due time,"
255,,and would have deepened and enriched his vein of song.
256,,"The first great emotion which found him, when he rallied"
257,,"to the trumpet-call of France and freedom, did, as a matter of fact,"
258,,lend new reality and poignancy to his verse; but the soldier's life
259,,"left him small leisure for composition.  We must regard his work, then,"
260,,"as a fragment, a mere foretaste of what he might have achieved"
261,,"had his life been prolonged.  But, devoted though he was to his art,"
262,,he felt that to live greatly is better than to write greatly.
263,,The unfulfilment of his poetic hopes and dreams meant
264,,the fulfilment of a higher ambition.
265,,
266,,
267,,"Alan Seeger was born in New York on June 22nd, 1888."
268,,His father and his mother belonged to old New England families.
269,,
270,,"When he was a year old his parents removed to Staten Island,"
271,,"which forms, as it were, the stopper to the bottle of New York harbour."
272,,"There he remained until his tenth year, growing up along with"
273,,"a brother and a sister, the one a little older, the other a little younger,"
274,,"than himself.  From their home on the heights of Staten Island,"
275,,the children looked out day by day upon one of the most romantic scenes
276,,in the world--the gateway to the Western Hemisphere.
277,,They could see the great steamships of all the nations
278,,threading their way through the Narrows and passing in procession
279,,"up the glorious expanse of New York Bay, to which the incessant local traffic"
280,,"of tug-boats, river steamers and huge steam-ferries lent"
281,,"an ever-shifting animation.  In the foreground lay Robbins Reef Lighthouse,"
282,,"in the middle distance the Statue of Liberty, in the background"
283,,"the giant curves of Brooklyn Bridge, and, range over range,"
284,,"the mountainous buildings of ""down town"" New York--not then as colossal"
285,,"as they are to-day, but already unlike anything else under the sun."
286,,And the incoming stream of tramps and liners met the outgoing stream
287,,"which carried the imagination seaward, to the islands of the buccaneers,"
288,,"and the haunts of all the heroes and villains of history, in the Old World."
289,,The children did not look with incurious eyes upon this stirring scene.
290,,They knew the names of all the great European liners and of the warships
291,,passing to and from the Navy Yard; and the walls of their nursery
292,,"were covered with their drawings of the shipping, rude enough, no doubt,"
293,,"but showing accurate observation of such details as funnels,"
294,,"masts and rigging.  They were of an age, before they left Staten Island,"
295,,to realize something of the historic implications of their environment.
296,,
297,,"In 1898 the family returned to New York, and there Alan continued"
298,,at the Horace Mann School the education begun at the Staten Island Academy.
299,,The great delight of the ten-year-old schoolboy was to follow
300,,the rushing fire-engines which were an almost daily feature
301,,in the life of the New York streets.  Even in manhood he could never resist
302,,the lure of the fire-alarm.
303,,
304,,"Two years later (1900) came a new migration, which no doubt exercised"
305,,a determining influence on the boy's development.  The family removed
306,,"to Mexico, and there Alan spent a great part of the most impressionable years"
307,,"of his youth.  If New York embodies the romance of Power,"
308,,Mexico represents to perfection the romance of Picturesqueness.
309,,To pass from the United States to Mexico is like passing at one bound from
310,,"the New World to the Old.  Wherever it has not been recently Americanized,"
311,,"its beauty is that of sunbaked, somnolent decay.  It is in many ways"
312,,"curiously like its mother--or rather its step-mother--country, Spain."
313,,But Spain can show nothing to equal the spacious magnificence of its scenery
314,,or the picturesqueness of its physiognomies and its costumes.
315,,And then it is the scene of the most fascinating adventure
316,,recorded in history--an exploit which puts to shame
317,,the imagination of the greatest masters of romance.
318,,It is true that the Mexico City of to-day shows scanty traces
319,,(except in its Museum) of the Tenochtitlan of Montezuma;
320,,"but the vast amphitheatre on which it stands is still wonderfully impressive,"
321,,and still the great silver cones of Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl
322,,look down upon it from their immaculate altitudes.
323,,
324,,"Though well within the tropics, the great elevation of the city (7400 feet)"
325,,renders its climate very attractive to those for whom height has no terrors;
326,,and the Seegers soon became greatly attached to it.
327,,"For two very happy years, it was the home of the whole family."
328,,"The children had a tutor whom they respected and loved,"
329,,and who helped to develop their taste for poetry and good literature.
330,,"""One of our keenest pleasures,"" writes one of the family, ""was to go in a body"
331,,"to the old book-shops, and on Sunday morning to the 'Thieves Market',"
332,,"to rummage for treasures; and many were the Elzevirs and worm-eaten,"
333,,vellum-bound volumes from the old convent libraries that fell into our hands.
334,,"At that time we issued a home magazine called 'The Prophet',"
335,,in honour of a large painting that we had acquired and chose to consider
336,,"as the patron of our household.  The magazine was supposed to appear monthly,"
337,,"but was always months behind its time.  Alan was the sporting editor,"
338,,"but his literary ability had even then begun to appear,"
339,,and he overstepped his department with contributions of poetry
340,,and lengthy essays.  No copies of this famous periodical are extant:
341,,"they all went down in the wreck of the 'Merida'."""
342,,
343,,"In the chilly days of winter, frequent visits were paid"
344,,"to the lower levels of the 'tierra templada', especially to Cuernavaca,"
345,,"one of the ""show"" places of the country.  The children learned to ride"
346,,"and to cycle, and were thus able to extend their excursions on all sides."
347,,"When, after two years, they went back to the United States to school,"
348,,they were already familiar with Mexican nature and life;
349,,and they kept their impressions fresh by frequent vacation visits.
350,,It must have been a delightful experience to slip down every now and then
351,,to the tropics:  first to pass under the pink walls of Morro Castle
352,,into the wide lagoon of Havana; then to cross the Spanish Main to Vera Cruz;
353,,"then, after skirting the giant escarpment of Orizaba,"
354,,to crawl zigzagging up the almost precipitous ascent
355,,that divides the 'tierra templada' from the 'tierra fria';
356,,"and finally to speed through the endless agave-fields of the upland haciendas,"
357,,to Mexico City and home.
358,,
359,,"Mexico, and the experiences associated with it, have left deep marks"
360,,on Alan Seeger's poetry.  The vacation voyages thither
361,,"speak in this apostrophe from the ""Ode to Antares"":"
362,,
363,,Star of the South that now through orient mist
364,,At nightfall off Tampico or Belize
365,,"Greetest the sailor, rising from those seas"
366,,"Where first in me, a fond romanticist,"
367,,The tropic sunset's bloom on cloudy piles
368,,Cast out industrious cares with dreams of fabulous isles. . . .
369,,
370,,"The longest of his poems, ""The Deserted Garden""--a veritable gallery"
371,,of imaginative landscape--is entirely Mexican in colouring.
372,,Indeed we may conjecture without too much rashness that it is a mere expansion
373,,"of the sonnet entitled ""Tezcotzinco"", the fruit of a solitary excursion"
374,,"to the ruins of Nezahualcoyotl's baths, in the hills beyond Tezcoco."
375,,"But even where there is no painting of definite Mexican scenes,"
376,,"motives from the vast uplands with their cloud pageantry,"
377,,"and from the palm-fringed, incandescent coasts, frequently recur in his verse."
378,,"For instance, he had not forgotten Mexico when he wrote in a volume"
379,,of the Comtesse de Noailles:
380,,
381,,Be my companion under cool arcades
382,,"That frame some drowsy street and dazzling square,"
383,,Beyond whose flowers and palm-tree promenades
384,,White belfries burn in the blue tropic air.
385,,
386,,"And even when the tropics were finally left behind,"
387,,"he carried with him in his memory their profusion of colour,"
388,,an ever-ready palette on which to draw.  Assuredly it was a fortunate chance
389,,"that took this lover of sunlight and space and splendor,"
390,,"in his most receptive years, to regions where they superabound."
391,,"Perhaps, had he been confined to gloomier climates, he could not have written:"
392,,
393,,From a boy
394,,I gloated on existence.  Earth to me
395,,"Seemed all-sufficient, and my sojourn there"
396,,One trembling opportunity for joy.
397,,
398,,But the same good fortune pursued him throughout.  He seemed predestined
399,,"to environments of beauty.  When, at fourteen, he left his Mexican home,"
400,,"it was to go to the Hackley School at Tarrytown, N.Y., an institution"
401,,"placed on a high hill overlooking that noblest of rivers, the Hudson,"
402,,"and surrounded by a domain of its own, extending to many acres"
403,,of meadow and woodland.  An attack of scarlet fever in his childhood
404,,"had left his health far from robust, and it was thought"
405,,that the altitude of Mexico City was too great for him.
406,,"He therefore spent one of his vacations among the hills of New Hampshire,"
407,,"and was afterwards given a year out of school, with the family"
408,,"of his former tutor, in Southern California--again a region"
409,,"famed for its beauty.  He returned much improved in health,"
410,,"and after a concluding year at Hackley, he entered Harvard College in 1906."
411,,
412,,"He now plunged into wide and miscellaneous reading, both at Harvard,"
413,,"and at the magnificent Boston Library.  During his first two years at college,"
414,,his bent seemed to lie rather towards the studious and contemplative
415,,"than towards the active life.  His brother, at this time,"
416,,appeared to him to be of a more pleasure-loving and adventurous disposition;
417,,"and there exists a letter to his mother in which, after contrasting,"
418,,"with obvious allusion to Chaucer's ""Prologue"", the mediaeval ideals"
419,,"of the Knight and the Clerk, he adds:  ""C. is the Knight and I the Clerk,"
420,,deriving more keen pleasure from the perusal of a musty old volume
421,,"than in pursuing adventure out in the world.""  But about the middle"
422,,"of his Harvard career, a marked change came over his habits of thought"
423,,"and of action.  He emerged from his shell, made many friends,"
424,,and threw himself with great zest into the social life of his comrades.
425,,"It is evident, however, that this did not mean any slackening"
426,,"in his literary interests.  His work gives ample proof of real,"
427,,"if not of systematic, culture.  He genuinely loves and has made his own"
428,,many of the great things of the past.  His translations from
429,,"Dante and Ariosto, for example, show no less sympathy than accomplishment."
430,,Very characteristic is his selection of the Twenty-sixth Canto
431,,"of the 'Inferno', in which the narrative of Ulysses brings with it"
432,,a breath from the great romance of the antique world.  It is noteworthy
433,,that before he graduated he took up with zeal and with distinction
434,,"the study of Celtic literature--a corrective, perhaps, in its cooler tones,"
435,,to the tropical motives with which his mind was stored.
436,,"He was one of the editors of the 'Harvard Monthly', to which he made"
437,,frequent contributions of verse.
438,,
439,,There followed two years (1910-12) in New York--probably the
440,,least satisfactory years of his life.  The quest of beauty
441,,"is scarcely a profession, and it caused his parents some concern"
442,,"to find him pausing irresolute on the threshold of manhood,"
443,,instead of setting himself a goal and bracing his energies
444,,"for its achievement.  In 1911 his mother and sister left Mexico,"
445,,"a week or two before Porfirio Diaz made his exit, and the Maderists"
446,,"entered the capital.  They returned to New York, to find Alan still unsettled,"
447,,"and possessed with the thought, or perhaps rather the instinct,"
448,,"that the life he craved for was not to be found in America,"
449,,"but awaited him in Europe.  In the following year he carried his point,"
450,,"and set off for Paris--a departure which may fairly be called his Hegira,"
451,,the turning-point of his history.  That it shortened his span
452,,"there can be little doubt.  Had he settled down to literary work,"
453,,"in his native city, he might have lived to old age.  But it secured him"
454,,four years of the tense and poignant joy of living on which his heart was set;
455,,and during two of these years the joy was of a kind which
456,,absolved him for ever from the reproach of mere hedonism and self-indulgence.
457,,"He would certainly have said--or rather he was continually saying,"
458,,in words full of passionate conviction --
459,,
460,,One crowded hour of glorious life
461,,Is worth an age without a name.
462,,
463,,It was in the spirit of a romanticist of the eighteen-forties that
464,,"he plunged into the life of Paris.  He had a room near the Musee de Cluny,"
465,,and he found himself thoroughly at home among the artists and students
466,,"of the Latin Quarter, though he occasionally varied the 'Vie de Boheme'"
467,,"by excursions into ""society"" of a more orthodox type."
468,,"Paris has had many lovers, but few more devoted than Alan Seeger."
469,,"He accepted the life of ""die singende, springende, schoene Paris"""
470,,with a curious whole-heartedness.  Here and there we find evidence
471,,"-- for instance, in the first two sonnets--that he was not blind"
472,,to its seamy side.  But on the whole he appears to have seen beauty
473,,even in aspects of it for which it is almost as difficult
474,,"to find aesthetic as moral justification.  The truth is, no doubt,"
475,,that the whole spectacle was plunged for him in the glamour of romance.
476,,"Paris did not belong to the working-day world, but was like"
477,,"Baghdad or Samarcand, a city of the Arabian Nights."
478,,How his imagination transfigured it we may see in such a passage as this:
479,,
480,,By silvery waters in the plains afar
481,,"Glimmers the inland city like a star,"
482,,"With gilded gates and sunny spires ablaze,"
483,,And burnished domes half seen through luminous haze.
484,,"Lo, with what opportunity earth teems!"
485,,How like a fair its ample beauty seems!
486,,Fluttering with flags its proud pavilions rise:
487,,"What bright bazaars, what marvellous merchandise,"
488,,"Down seething alleys what melodious din,"
489,,"What clamor, importuning from every booth:"
490,,At Earth's great mart where Joy is trafficked in
491,,Buy while thy purse yet swells with golden Youth!
492,,
493,,"Into this fair he sallied forth, not as one to the manner born,"
494,,"but with the eagerness of a traveller from a far country, who feels as though"
495,,he were living in a dream.  His attitude to the whole experience
496,,"is curiously ingenuous, but perfectly sane and straightforward."
497,,"It is the Paris of Murger in which he lives, not the Paris"
498,,of Baudelaire and the Second Empire.  He takes his experiences lightly.
499,,There is no sign either of any struggle of the soul or of any very rending
500,,"tempest of the heart.  There is no posing, self-conscious Byronism,"
501,,"nor any of that morbid dallying with the idea of ""sin"""
502,,"which gives such an unpleasant flavor to a good deal of romantic poetry,"
503,,"both French and English.  There are traces of disappointment and disillusion,"
504,,but they are accepted without a murmur as inevitable incidents
505,,"of a great, absorbing experience.  All this means, of course,"
506,,"that there is no tragic depth, and little analytic subtlety, in these poems."
507,,"They are the work of a young man enamoured of his youth,"
508,,"enthusiastically grateful for the gift of life, and entirely at his ease"
509,,within his own moral code.  He had known none of what he himself calls
510,,"""that kind of affliction which alone can unfold the profundities"
511,,"of the human spirit."""
512,,
513,,"It was in Paris that he produced most of the ""Juvenilia"".  He included"
514,,only a few of the pieces which he had written at Harvard and in New York.
515,,"Thus all, or nearly all, the poems ranged under that title, are, as he said --"
516,,
517,,Relics of the time when I too fared
518,,Across the sweet fifth lustrum of my days.
519,,
520,,"Paris, however, did not absorb him entirely during these years."
521,,He would occasionally set forth on long tramps through the French provinces;
522,,for he loved every aspect of that gracious country.  He once spent some weeks
523,,with a friend in Switzerland; but this experience seems to have left no trace
524,,in his work.
525,,
526,,
527,,"Then came the fateful year 1914.  His ""Juvenilia"" having grown"
528,,"to a passable bulk, he brought them in the early summer to London,"
529,,with a view to finding a publisher for them; but it does not appear
530,,that he took any very active steps to that effect.  His days were mainly spent
531,,"in the British Museum, and his evenings with a coterie of friends"
532,,"at the Cafe Royal.  In the middle of July, his father came to England"
533,,and spent a week with him.  Of this meeting Mr. Seeger writes:
534,,
535,,==
536,,We passed three days at Canterbury--three days of such intimacy
537,,as we had hardly had since he was a boy in Mexico.  For four or five years
538,,"I had only seen him a few days at a time, during my hurried visits"
539,,"to the United States.  We explored the old town together,"
540,,"heard services in the Cathedral, and had long talks in the close."
541,,"After service in the Cathedral on a Monday morning,"
542,,"the last of our stay at Canterbury, Alan was particularly enthusiastic"
543,,"over the reading of the Psalms, and said ""Was there ever such English written"
544,,"as that of the Bible?""  I said good-bye to Alan on July 25th."
545,,
546,,==
547,,
548,,"Two days earlier, the Austrian Ultimatum had been presented to Serbia;"
549,,"on that very day the time limit expired, the Serbian reply was rejected,"
550,,and the Austrian Minister left Belgrade.  The wheels of fate
551,,were already whirling.
552,,
553,,As soon as it became evident that a European war was inevitable
554,,"Alan returned to Paris.  He took Bruges on his way, and there left"
555,,"the manuscript of his poems in the keeping of a printer,"
556,,not foreseeing the risks to which he was thus exposing them.
557,,
558,,"The war was not three weeks old when, along with forty or fifty"
559,,"of his fellow-countrymen, he enlisted in the Foreign Legion of France."
560,,"Why did he take this step?  Fundamentally, no doubt, because he felt war"
561,,"to be one of the supreme experiences of life, from which,"
562,,"when it offered itself, he could not shrink without disloyalty to his ideal."
563,,"Long before the war was anything more than a vague possibility,"
564,,he had imagined the time
565,,
566,,. . . when courted Death shall claim my limbs and find them
567,,"Laid in some desert place alone, or where the tides"
568,,Of war's tumultuous waves on the wet sands behind them
569,,Leave rifts of gasping life when their red flood subsides.
570,,
571,,"So far back indeed as May, 1912, he had written to his mother from Paris:"
572,,"""Is it not fine the way the Balkan States are triumphing?"
573,,"I have been so excited over the war, it would have needed"
574,,"a very small opportunity to have taken me over there.""  It is evident, then,"
575,,that the soldier's life had long been included among the possibilities
576,,"which fascinated him.  But apart from this general proclivity to adventure,"
577,,"this desire to ""live dangerously"", he was impelled by a simple sentiment"
578,,"of loyalty to the country and city of his heart, which he himself explained"
579,,in a letter written from the Aisne trenches to 'The New Republic'
580,,"(New York, May 22, 1915):"
581,,
582,,==
583,,
584,,I have talked with so many of the young volunteers here.  Their case
585,,"is little known, even by the French, yet altogether interesting and appealing."
586,,They are foreigners on whom the outbreak of war laid no formal compulsion.
587,,"But they had stood on the butte in springtime perhaps,"
588,,"as Julian and Louise stood, and looked out over the myriad twinkling lights"
589,,"of the beautiful city.  Paris--mystic, maternal, personified,"
590,,to whom they owed the happiest moments of their lives--Paris was in peril.
591,,"Were they not under a moral obligation, no less binding than [that by which]"
592,,"their comrades were bound legally, to put their breasts between her"
593,,"and destruction?  Without renouncing their nationality, they had yet chosen"
594,,to make their homes here beyond any other city in the world.
595,,Did not the benefits and blessings they had received point them a duty
596,,that heart and conscience could not deny?
597,,
598,,"""Why did you enlist?""  In every case the answer was the same."
599,,"That memorable day in August came.  Suddenly the old haunts were desolate,"
600,,the boon companions had gone.  It was unthinkable to leave the danger to them
601,,"and accept only the pleasures oneself, to go on enjoying"
602,,the sweet things of life in defence of which they were perhaps even then
603,,"shedding their blood in the north.  Some day they would return,"
604,,"and with honor--not all, but some.  The old order of things"
605,,would have irrevocably vanished.  There would be a new companionship
606,,"whose bond would be the common danger run, the common sufferings borne,"
607,,"the common glory shared.  ""And where have you been all the time,"
608,,"and what have you been doing?""  The very question would be a reproach,"
609,,though none were intended.  How could they endure it?
610,,
611,,"Face to face with a situation like that, a man becomes reconciled,"
612,,"justifies easily the part he is playing, and comes to understand,"
613,,in a universe where logic counts for so little and sentiment and the impulse
614,,"of the heart for so much, the inevitableness and naturalness of war."
615,,Suddenly the world is up in arms.  All mankind takes sides.  The same faith
616,,"that made him surrender himself to the impulses of normal living and of love,"
617,,forces him now to make himself the instrument through which a greater force
618,,works out its inscrutable ends through the impulses of terror and repulsion.
619,,And with no less a sense of moving in harmony with a universe
620,,where masses are in continual conflict and new combinations are engendered
621,,"out of eternal collisions, he shoulders arms and marches forth with haste."
622,,
623,,==
624,,
625,,Already in this passage we can discern the fatalistic acceptance of war
626,,"which runs through many of his utterances on the subject,"
627,,"and may be read especially in the noble conclusion of his poem, ""The Hosts"":"
628,,
629,,There was a stately drama writ
630,,By the hand that peopled the earth & air
631,,And set the stars in the infinite
632,,And made night gorgeous & morning fair;
633,,And all that had sense to reason knew
634,,That bloody drama must be gone through.
635,,Some sat & watched how the action veered --
636,,"Waited, profited, trembled, cheered --"
637,,"We saw not clearly nor understood,"
638,,"But, yielding ourselves to the master hand,"
639,,"Each in his part, as best he could,"
640,,We played it through as the author planned.
641,,
642,,"It was not, in his own conception, a ""war against war"" that he was waging;"
643,,it was simply a fight for freedom and for France.  Some of us may hope
644,,"and believe that, in after years, when he was at leisure"
645,,"to view history in perspective and carry his psychology a little deeper,"
646,,"he would have allowed, if not more potency, at any rate more adaptability,"
647,,"to the human will.  In order to do so, it would not have been necessary"
648,,"to abandon his fatalistic creed.  He would have seen, perhaps,"
649,,"that even if we only will what we have to will, the factors which shape"
650,,"the will--of the individual, the nation, or the race--are always changing,"
651,,and that it is not only possible but probable that the factors
652,,which make for peace may one day gain the upper hand of those which
653,,(for perfectly definite and tangible reasons) have hitherto made for war.
654,,"The fact remains, however, that he shouldered his knapsack"
655,,without any theoretic distaste for the soldier's calling.
656,,In so far he was more happily situated than thousands who have made
657,,all the better soldiers for their intense detestation of the stupidity of war.
658,,"But this in no way detracts from his loyalty to his personal ideal,"
659,,or from the high chivalry of his devotion to France.
660,,
661,,"The story of his life as a soldier shall be told, so far as possible,"
662,,in his own words.
663,,
664,,After some brief preliminary training at Rouen he was sent to Toulouse.
665,,"Thence, on September 28, 1914, he wrote as follows:"
666,,
667,,==
668,,
669,,"2me Regiment Etranger,"
670,,"Bataillon C., 1re. Cie, 3me Section."
671,,"Toulouse, Sept. 28, 1914."
672,,
673,,"Dear Mother,"
674,,
675,,". . .  We have been putting in our time here at very hard drilling,"
676,,"and are supposed to have learned in six weeks what the ordinary recruit,"
677,,"in times of peace, takes all his two years at.  We rise at 5,"
678,,and work stops in the afternoon at 5.  A twelve hours day at one sou a day.
679,,"I hope to earn higher wages than this in time to come, but I never expect"
680,,to work harder.  The early rising hour is splendid for it gives one the chance
681,,to see the most beautiful part of these beautiful autumn days in the South.
682,,We march up to a lovely open field on the end of the ridge
683,,"behind the barracks, walking right into the rising sun."
684,,"From this panorama, spread about on three sides is incomparably fine"
685,,"-- yellow cornfields, vineyards, harvest-fields where"
686,,the workers and their teams can be seen moving about in tiny figures --
687,,"poplars, little hamlets and church-towers, and far away to the south"
688,,"the blue line of the Pyrenees, the high peaks capped with snow."
689,,"It makes one in love with life, it is all so peaceful and beautiful."
690,,"But Nature to me is not only hills and blue skies and flowers,"
691,,"but the Universe, the totality of things, reality as it most obviously"
692,,presents itself to us; and in this universe strife and sternness
693,,"play as big a part as love and tenderness, and cannot be shirked"
694,,by one whose will it is to rule his life in accordance with the cosmic forces
695,,"he sees in play about him.  I hope you see the thing as I do, and think"
696,,"that I have done well, being without responsibilities and with no one"
697,,"to suffer materially by my decision, in taking upon my shoulders, too,"
698,,"the burden that so much of humanity is suffering under,"
699,,"and, rather than stand ingloriously aside when the opportunity was given me,"
700,,doing my share for the side that I think right. . . .

704,,The battalion must have left Toulouse almost immediately
705,,"after this was written, for in a post-card of October 10,"
706,,"from the Camp de Mailly, Aube, he says that they have been there ten days."
707,,A week later he wrote:
708,,
709,,==
710,,
711,,". . .  After two weeks here and less than two months from enlistment,"
712,,we are actually going at last to the firing line.  By the time
713,,you receive this we shall already perhaps have had our 'bapteme de feu'.
714,,We have been engaged in the hardest kind of hard work
715,,"-- two weeks of beautiful autumn weather on the whole,"
716,,frosty nights and sunny days and beautiful coloring on the sparse foliage
717,,that breaks here and there the wide rolling expanses of open country.
718,,"Every day, from the distance to the north, has come the booming of the cannon"
719,,around Reims and the lines along the Meuse. . . .  But imagine how thrilling
720,,"it will be tomorrow and the following days, marching toward the front"
721,,with the noise of battle growing continually louder before us.
722,,"I could tell you where we are going, but I do not want to run any risk"
723,,"of having this letter stopped by the censor.  The whole regiment is going,"
724,,"four battalions, about 4000 men.  You have no idea how beautiful it is to see"
725,,"the troops undulating along the road in front of one, in 'colonnes par quatre'"
726,,"as far as the eye can see, with the captains and lieutenants on horseback"
727,,at the head of their companies. . . .  Tomorrow the real hardship
728,,and privations begin.  But I go into action with the lightest of light hearts.
729,,The hard work and moments of frightful fatigue have not broken
730,,"but hardened me, and I am in excellent health and spirits. . . ."
731,,I am happy and full of excitement over the wonderful days that are ahead.

752,,Dear Mother. . . .  I am sitting on the curbstone of a street
753,,at the edge of the town.  The houses end abruptly and the yellow vineyards
754,,begin here.  The view is broad and uninterrupted to the crest
755,,ten kilometers or so across the valley.  Between this and ourselves are
756,,"the lines of the two armies.  A fierce cannonading is going on continually,"
757,,"and I lift my eyes from the sheet at each report, to see the puffs of smoke"
758,,two or three miles off.  The Germans have been firing salvoes of four shots
759,,"over a little village where the French batteries are stationed,"
760,,shrapnel that burst in little puffs of white smoke; the French reply
761,,with explosive shells that raise columns of dust over the German lines.
762,,Half of our regiment have left already for the trenches.  We may go tonight.
763,,"We have made a march of about 75 kilometers in four days, and are now"
764,,"on the front, ready to be called on at any moment.  I am feeling fine,"
765,,"in my element, for I have always thirsted for this kind of thing,"
766,,to be present always where the pulsations are liveliest.  Every minute here
767,,"is worth weeks of ordinary experience.  How beautiful the view is here,"
768,,over the sunny vineyards!  And what a curious anomaly.
769,,"On this slope the grape pickers are singing merrily at their work,"
770,,on the other the batteries are roaring.  Boom!  Boom!
771,,
772,,This will spoil one for any other kind of life.  The yellow afternoon sunlight
773,,is sloping gloriously across this beautiful valley of Champagne.
774,,Aeroplanes pass continually overhead on reconnaissance.  I must mail this now.
775,,There is too much to be said and too little time to say it.
776,,So glad to get your letter.  Love and lots of it to all.

780,,==
781,,
782,,"Alas! the hopes of swift, decisive action with which the Legion advanced"
783,,were destined to disappointment.  They soon settled down for the winter into
784,,the monotonous hardships of trench warfare.  Alan described this experience
785,,"in admirably vivid letters published in the New York 'Sun',"
786,,"from which a few extracts must suffice.  He writes on December 8,"
787,,during his fourth period of service in the trenches:
788,,
789,,==
790,,
791,,"We left our camp in the woods before daybreak this morning,"
792,,"and marched up the hill in single file, under the winter stars. . . ."
793,,Through openings in the woods we could see that we were marching
794,,"along a high ridge, and on either hand vaporous depths and distances expanded,"
795,,the darkness broken sometimes by a far light or the momentary glow
796,,of a magnesium rocket sent up from the German lines.
797,,There is something fascinating if one is stationed on sentry-duty
798,,"immediately after arrival, in watching the dawn slowly illumine"
799,,"one of these new landscapes, from a position taken up under cover of darkness."
800,,"The other section has been relieved and departs.  We are given the 'consigne',"
801,,"by the preceding sentinel, and are left alone behind a mound of dirt,"
802,,"facing the north and the blank, perilous night.  Slowly the mystery"
803,,that it shrouds resolves as the grey light steals over the eastern hills.
804,,"Like a photograph in the washing, its high lights and shadows"
805,,come gradually forth.  The light splash in the foreground
806,,"becomes a ruined chateau, the grey street a demolished village."
807,,
808,,"The details come out on the hillside opposite, where the silent trenches"
809,,of the enemy are hidden a few hundred metres away.  We find ourselves
810,,"in a woody, mountainous country, with broad horizons and streaks of mist"
811,,"in the valleys.  Our position is excellent this time, a high crest,"
812,,with open land sloping down from the trenches and plenty of barbed wire
813,,strung along immediately in front.  It would be a hard task
814,,"to carry such a line, and there is not much danger that the enemy will try."
815,,
816,,"With increasing daylight the sentinel takes a sheltered position,"
817,,and surveys his new environment through little gaps where the mounds
818,,have been crenellated and covered with branches.  Suddenly he starts
819,,as a metallic bang rings out from the woods immediately behind him.
820,,It is of the unmistakable voice of a French 75 starting the day's
821,,"artillery duel.  By the time the sentinel is relieved, in broad daylight,"
822,,the cannonade is general all along the line.  He surrenders his post
823,,"to a comrade, and crawls down into his bombproof dugout almost reluctantly,"
824,,for the long day of inactive waiting has commenced.
825,,
826,,==
827,,
828,,"Though he never expresses even a momentary regret for the choice he has made,"
829,,"he freely admits that trench warfare is ""anything but romantic""."
830,,"For the artilleryman it is ""doubtless very interesting"""
831,,"but ""the poor common soldier"" has a pretty mean time of it:"
832,,
833,,==
834,,
835,,His rule is simply to dig himself a hole in the ground
836,,and to keep hidden in it as tightly as possible.  Continually under
837,,"the fire of the opposing batteries, he is yet never allowed"
838,,"to get a glimpse of the enemy.  Exposed to all the dangers of war,"
839,,"but with none of its enthusiasm or splendid elan, he is condemned to sit"
840,,"like an animal in its burrow, and hear the shells whistle over his head,"
841,,and take their little daily toll from his comrades.
842,,
843,,The winter morning dawns with grey skies and the hoar frost on the fields.
844,,"His feet are numb, his canteen frozen, but he is not allowed to make a fire."
845,,"The winter night falls, with its prospect of sentry-duty,"
846,,and the continual apprehension of the hurried call to arms; he is not
847,,"even permitted to light a candle, but must fold himself in his blanket"
848,,and lie down cramped in the dirty straw to sleep as best he may.
849,,"How different from the popular notion of the evening campfire,"
850,,the songs and good cheer.
851,,
852,,==
853,,
854,,"Of the commissariat arrangements he gives, on the whole, a very good account;"
855,,"but he admits that ""to supplement the regular rations with luxuries"
856,,"such as butter, cheese, preserves, & especially chocolate,"
857,,is a matter that occupies more of the young soldier's thoughts
858,,than the invisible enemy.  Our corporal told us the other day
859,,that there wasn't a man in the squad that wouldn't exchange his rifle
860,,"for a jar of jam.""  But ""though modern warfare allows us to think"
861,,"more about eating than fighting, still we do not actually forget"
862,,"that we are in a battle line."""
863,,
864,,==
865,,
866,,Ever over our heads goes on the precise and scientific struggle
867,,"of the artillery.  Packed elbow to elbow in these obscure galleries,"
868,,"one might be content to squat all day long, auditor of the magnificent"
869,,"orchestra of battle, were it not that one becomes so soon habituated to it"
870,,that it is no longer magnificent.  We hear the voices of cannon
871,,of all calibres and at all distances.  We learn to read the score
872,,& distinguish the instruments.  Near us are field batteries;
873,,"far away are siege guns.  Over all there is the unmistakable,"
874,,"sharp, metallic twang of the French 75, the whistle of its shell"
875,,and the lesser report of its explosion.
876,,
877,,==
878,,
879,,"And every now and then comes the bursting of a shell immediately overhead,"
880,,and the rattle of its fragments on the roof of the bomb-proof dug-out.
881,,"Think what it must have meant to this eager, ardent, pleasure-loving spirit"
882,,"to sit out, day after day, in a chill, sodden, verminous trench,"
883,,a grand orchestral concert of this music of human madness!
884,,
885,,The solitude of sentry-duty evidently comes to him as something of a relief.
886,,"""It may,"" he says, ""be all that is melancholy if the night is bad"
887,,"and the winter wind moans through the pines""; but it also"
888,,"""brings moments of exaltation, if the cloud-banks roll back,"
889,,"if the moonlight breaks over the windless hills, or the heavens blaze"
890,,"with the beauty of the northern stars."""

894,,"The sentinel has ample time for reflection.  Alone under the stars,"
895,,war in its cosmic rather than its moral aspect reveals itself to him. . . .
896,,"He thrills with the sense of filling an appointed, necessary place"

915,,"""like many others of his type, was long ago eliminated from our ranks,"
916,,for a person buoyed up by no noble purpose is the first to succumb
917,,to the hardships of the winter that we have been through. . . .

922,,"has been generous beyond anything that one would think possible,"
923,,"it is too shameful for any words to characterize."""

934,,"in the ruined villages, loafing in the pretty garden of the chateau,"
935,,"or reading up in the library.  We have cleaned this up now,"
936,,"and it is an altogether curious sensation to recline here in an easy-chair,"

962,,to the triumph of the cause whose righteousness you feel so keenly.
963,,Everybody should take part in this struggle which is to have
964,,"so decisive an effect, not only on the nations engaged but on all humanity."
965,,"There should be no neutrals, but everyone should bear some part of the burden."
966,,"If so large a part should fall to your share, you would be in so far"

980,,Whether I am on the winning or losing side is not the point with me:
981,,"it is being on the side where my sympathies lie that matters,"

990,,In this letter he says that an article about Rupert Brooke
991,,"in which his name was mentioned ""gave him rather more pain than pleasure,"
992,,"for it rubbed in the matter which most rankled in his heart,"
993,,"that he never could get his book of poems published before the war."""
994,,However he consoles himself with the reflection that the M.S.
995,,"is probably as safe at Bruges as anywhere else.  ""We have finished"

997,,"of an imminent return to the rear for reorganization."""

1004,,"We have finally come to the rear for a little rest and reorganization,"
1005,,"and are cantoned in a valley not far from Belfort, in the extreme east"
1006,,"of France, very near the Swiss frontier.  Since I wrote you last,"
1007,,"all the Americans in the regiment received 48 hours permission in Paris,"
1008,,and it was a great happiness to get back even for so short a while
1009,,and to see again old scenes and faces after almost a year's absence.
1010,,We shall be here several weeks perhaps.

1014,,Three weeks later (August 8) he wrote to his mother:

1017,,
1018,,". . .  I have always had the passion to play the biggest part within my reach,"
1019,,and it is really in a sense a supreme success to be allowed to play this.
1020,,"If I do not come out, I will share the good fortune of those who disappear"
1021,,at the pinnacle of their careers.  Come to love France and understand
1022,,"the almost unexampled nobility of the effort this admirable people is making,"

1028,,"The spell of rest lasted some two months, and then the Legion"
1029,,returned to the front in time for the battle in Champagne
1030,,"""in which"" he writes ""we took part from the beginning,"
1031,,"the morning of the memorable 25th. September.""  I cannot resist"
1032,,quoting at some length from the admirably vivid letter
1033,,in which he gave an account of this experience:
1034,,
1035,,==
1036,,
1037,,The part we played in the battle is briefly as follows.
1038,,"We broke camp about 11 o'clock the night of the 24th, and marched up"
1039,,through ruined Souain to our place in one of the numerous 'boyaux'
1040,,where the 'troupes d'attaque' were massed.  The cannonade was pretty violent
1041,,"all that night, as it had been for several days previous, but toward dawn"
1042,,it reached an intensity unimaginable to anyone who has not seen
1043,,"a modern battle.  A little before 9.15 the fire lessened suddenly,"
1044,,and the crackle of the fusillade between the reports of the cannon
1045,,told us that the first wave of assault had left and the attack begun.
1046,,At the same time we received the order to advance.  The German artillery
1047,,had now begun to open upon us in earnest.  Amid the most infernal roar of
1048,,"every kind of fire-arms, and through an atmosphere heavy with dust and smoke,"
1049,,we marched up through the 'boyaux' to the 'tranchees de depart'.
1050,,"At shallow places and over breaches that shells had made in the bank,"
1051,,we caught momentary glimpses of the blue lines sweeping up the hillside
1052,,or silhouetted on the crest where they poured into the German trenches.
1053,,"When the last wave of the Colonial brigade had left, we followed."
1054,,"'Bayonette au canon', in lines of 'tirailleurs', we crossed"
1055,,"the open space between the lines, over the barbed wire,"
1056,,"where not so many of our men were lying as I had feared,"
1057,,"(thanks to the efficacy of the bombardment) and over the German trench,"
1058,,knocked to pieces and filled with their dead.  In some places
1059,,"they still resisted in isolated groups.  Opposite us, all was over,"
1060,,and the herds of prisoners were being already led down as we went up.
1061,,"We cheered, more in triumph than in hate; but the poor devils,"
1062,,"terror-stricken, held up their hands, begged for their lives,"
1063,,"cried ""Kamerad"", ""Bon Francais"", even ""Vive la France""."
1064,,We advanced and lay down in columns by twos behind the second crest.
1065,,"Meanwhile, bridges had been thrown across trenches and 'boyaux',"
1066,,"and the artillery, leaving the emplacements where they had been"
1067,,"anchored a whole year, came across and took position in the open,"
1068,,a magnificent spectacle.  Squadrons of cavalry came up.
1069,,"Suddenly the long, unpicturesque 'guerre de tranchees' was at an end,"
1070,,"and the field really presented the aspect of the familiar battle pictures, --"
1071,,"the battalions in manoeuvre, the officers, superbly indifferent to danger,"
1072,,"galloping about on their chargers.  But now the German guns, moved back,"
1073,,"began to get our range, and the shells to burst over and around"
1074,,"batteries and troops, many with admirable precision.  Here my best comrade"
1075,,"was struck down by shrapnel at my side,--painfully but not mortally wounded."
1076,,
1077,,I often envied him after that.  For now our advanced troops
1078,,"were in contact with the German second-line defenses,"
1079,,and these proved to be of a character so formidable
1080,,that all further advance without a preliminary artillery preparation
1081,,"was out of the question.  And our role, that of troops in reserve,"
1082,,was to lie passive in an open field under a shell fire that every hour
1083,,"became more terrific, while aeroplanes and captive balloons,"
1084,,"to which we were entirely exposed, regulated the fire."
1085,,
1086,,That night we spent in the rain.  With portable picks and shovels
1087,,each man dug himself in as well as possible.  The next day
1088,,"our concentrated artillery again began the bombardment,"
1089,,and again the fusillade announced the entrance of the infantry into action.
1090,,"But this time only the wounded appeared coming back, no prisoners."
1091,,"I went out and gave water to one of these, eager to get news."
1092,,"It was a young soldier, wounded in the hand.  His face and voice"
1093,,"bespoke the emotion of the experience he had been through,"
1094,,"in a way that I will never forget.  ""Ah, les salauds!"" he cried,"
1095,,"""They let us come right up to the barbed wire without firing.  Then a hail"
1096,,"of grenades and balls.  My comrade fell, shot through the leg, got up,"
1097,,"and the next moment had his head taken off by a grenade before my eyes."""
1098,,"""And the barbed wire, wasn't it cut down by the bombardment?"""
1099,,"""Not at all in front of us.""  I congratulated him on having"
1100,,a 'blessure heureuse' and being well out of the affair.
1101,,But he thought only of his comrade and went on down the road toward Souain
1102,,"nursing his mangled hand, with the stream of wounded"
1103,,seeking their 'postes de secours'.
1104,,
1105,,==
1106,,
1107,,"He then tells how, in spite of substantial gains, it gradually"
1108,,"""became more and more evident that the German second line of defence"
1109,,"presented obstacles too serious to attempt overcoming for the moment,"
1110,,and we began going up at night to work at consolidating our advanced trenches
1111,,"and turning them into a new permanent line.""  To this time, perhaps,"
1112,,"belongs the incident related by Rif Baer, an Egyptian,"
1113,,who was his comrade and best friend in the regiment.
1114,,"A piece of difficult trench work was allotted to the men,"
1115,,"to be finished in one night.  ""Each was given the limit,"
1116,,that he was supposed to be able to complete in the time.
1117,,"It happened that Rif Baer was ill, and, after working a while,"
1118,,"his strength gave out.  Alan completed his own job and R. B.'s also,"
1119,,"and although he was quite exhausted by the extra labour,"
1120,,"his eyes glowed with happiness, and he said he had never done"
1121,,"anything in his life that gave him such entire satisfaction."""
1122,,
1123,,"Summing up the results of the battle, Alan wrote (still in the same letter,"
1124,,"October 25):  ""It was a satisfaction at least to get out of the trenches,"
1125,,to meet the enemy face to face and to see German arrogance
1126,,"turned into suppliance.  We knew many splendid moments,"
1127,,"worth having endured many trials for.  But in our larger aim,"
1128,,"of piercing their line, of breaking the long deadlock,"
1129,,"of entering Vouziers in triumph, of course we failed.""  Then he proceeds:"
1130,,
1131,,==
1132,,
1133,,"This affair only deepened my admiration for, my loyalty to, the French."
1134,,"If we did not entirely succeed, it was not the fault of the French soldier."
1135,,"He is a better man, man for man, than the German.  Anyone who had seen"
1136,,the charge of the Marsouins at Souain would acknowledge it.
1137,,"Never was anything more magnificent.  I remember a captain,"
1138,,"badly wounded in the leg, as he passed us, borne back on a litter"
1139,,"by four German prisoners.  He asked us what regiment we were,"
1140,,"and when we told him, he cried ""Vive la Legion,"" and kept repeating"
1141,,"""Nous les avons en.  Nous les avons en.""  He was suffering, but,"
1142,,"oblivious of his wound, was still fired with the enthusiasm of the assault"
1143,,and all radiant with victory.  What a contrast with the German wounded
1144,,on whose faces was nothing but terror and despair.  What is the stimulus
1145,,"in their slogans of ""Gott mit uns"" and ""Fuer Koenig und Vaterland"""
1146,,beside that of men really fighting in defense of their country?
1147,,Whatever be the force in international conflicts of having justice
1148,,"and all the principles of personal morality on one's side, it at least"
1149,,gives the French soldier a strength that's like the strength of ten
1150,,against an adversary whose weapon is only brute violence.
1151,,"It is inconceivable that a Frenchman, forced to yield,"
1152,,"could behave as I saw German prisoners behave, trembling, on their knees,"
1153,,for all the world like criminals at length overpowered and brought to justice.
1154,,"Such men have to be driven to the assault, or intoxicated."
1155,,But the Frenchman who goes up is possessed with a passion
1156,,beside which any of the other forms of experience that are reckoned
1157,,to make life worth while seem pale in comparison.

1161,,A report appeared in the American newspapers that he had been killed
1162,,"in the battle of Champagne.  On learning of it, he wrote to his mother:"

1230,,They were marked on the other hand by two afternoons of rather
1231,,"memorable emotion.  Exasperated by the inactivity of the sector here,"
1232,,"and tempted by danger, I stole off twice after guard,"
1233,,and made a patrol all by myself through the wood paths and trails
1234,,"between the lines.  In the front of these, at a crossing of paths"
1235,,"not far from one of our posts, I found a burnt rocket-stick"

1312,,Withered beneath the shrapnel's iron showers: --
1313,,"Now heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops,"
1314,,"Now heaven be thanked, a few brave drops were ours."
1315,,
1316,,His death was briefly noticed in one or two French papers.
1317,,"The 'Matin' published a translation of part of the poem, ""Champagne, 1914-15"","
1318,,"and remarked that ""Cyrano de Bergerac would have signed it."""
1319,,"But France had no time, even if she had had the knowledge,"
1320,,to realize the greatness of the sacrifice that had been made for her.
1321,,That will come later.  One day France will know that this unassuming
1322,,"soldier of the Legion,"
1323,,
1324,,"Who, not unmindful of the antique debt,"
1325,,"Came back the generous path of Lafayette,"
1326,,
1327,,was one whom even she may be proud to have reckoned among her defenders.
1328,,
1329,,"The ""Last Poems"" speak for themselves.  They contain lines which he would"
1330,,doubtless have remodelled had he lived to review them in tranquillity --
1331,,"perhaps one or two pieces, sprung from a momentary mood,"
1332,,"which, on reflection he would have rejected.*  But they not only show"
1333,,"a great advance on his earlier work:  they rank high, or I am much mistaken,"
1334,,"among the hitherto not very numerous poems in the English language produced,"
1335,,"not in mere memory or imagination of war, but in its actual stress"
1336,,and under its haunting menace.
1337,,
1338,,--

1340,,"* Neither in the ""Juvenilia"" nor in the ""Last Poems"""
1341,,has anything been suppressed that he himself ever thought of publishing.
1342,,"Indeed nothing at all has been omitted, except two early poems"
1343,,"on which he had written ""These are worthless."""

1350,,
1351,,The resignation and the calm
1352,,"And wisdom of the East,"
1353,,
1354,,he returns to the note of fatalism.  Here he has not only
1355,,the wisdom of the East but the logic of the West on his side.
1356,,Necessity is as incontrovertible to thought as it is incredible to feeling.
1357,,But in the potent illusion of free-will (if illusion it be) rests
1358,,all morality and all the admiration that we feel for good and evil deeds.
1359,,"Not even at Alan Seeger's bidding can we quite persuade ourselves that,"
1360,,"when he took up arms for France, he was exercising no brave,"
1361,,"no generous choice, but was the conscript of Destiny."

1380,,
1381,,
1382,,There is a power whose inspiration fills
1383,,"Nature's fair fabric, sun- and star-inwrought,"
1384,,"Like airy dew ere any drop distils,"
1385,,"Like perfume in the laden flower, like aught"
1386,,Unseen which interfused throughout the whole
1387,,Becomes its quickening pulse and principle and soul.
1388,,"Now when, the drift of old desire renewing,"
1389,,"Warm tides flow northward over valley and field,"
1390,,When half-forgotten sound and scent are wooing
1391,,From their deep-chambered recesses long sealed
1392,,Such memories as breathe once more
1393,,"Of childhood and the happy hues it wore,"
1394,,"Now, with a fervor that has never been"
1395,,"In years gone by, it stirs me to respond, --"
1396,,Not as a force whose fountains are within
1397,,"The faculties of the percipient mind,"
1398,,"Subject with them to darkness and decay,"
1399,,"But something absolute, something beyond,"
1400,,Oft met like tender orbs that seem to peer
1401,,"From pale horizons, luminous behind"
1402,,Some fringe of tinted cloud at close of day;
1403,,"And in this flood of the reviving year,"
1404,,"When to the loiterer by sylvan streams,"
1405,,"Deep in those cares that make Youth loveliest,"
1406,,Nature in every common aspect seems
1407,,To comment on the burden in his breast --
1408,,The joys he covets and the dreams he dreams --
1409,,One then with all beneath the radiant skies
1410,,"That laughs with him or sighs,"
1411,,"It courses through the lilac-scented air,"
1412,,"A blessing on the fields, a wonder everywhere."
1413,,
1414,,"Spirit of Beauty, whose sweet impulses,"
1415,,"Flung like the rose of dawn across the sea,"
1416,,Alone can flush the exalted consciousness
1417,,With shafts of sensible divinity --
1418,,"Light of the World, essential loveliness:"
1419,,Him whom the Muse hath made thy votary
1420,,Not from her paths and gentle precepture
1421,,"Shall vulgar ends engage, nor break the spell"
1422,,That taught him first to feel thy secret charms
1423,,"And o'er the earth, obedient to their lure,"
1424,,"Their sweet surprise and endless miracle,"
1425,,To follow ever with insatiate arms.
1426,,"On summer afternoons,"
1427,,"When from the blue horizon to the shore,"
1428,,Casting faint silver pathways like the moon's
1429,,"Across the Ocean's glassy, mottled floor,"
1430,,Far clouds uprear their gleaming battlements
1431,,"Drawn to the crest of some bleak eminence,"
1432,,When autumn twilight fades on the sere hill
1433,,And autumn winds are still;
1434,,"To watch the East for some emerging sign,"
1435,,Wintry Capella or the Pleiades
1436,,Or that great huntsman with the golden gear;
1437,,Ravished in hours like these
1438,,Before thy universal shrine
1439,,"To feel the invoked presence hovering near,"
1440,,He stands enthusiastic.  Star-lit hours
1441,,Spent on the roads of wandering solitude
1442,,"Have set their sober impress on his brow,"
1443,,"And he, with harmonies of wind and wood"
1444,,"And torrent and the tread of mountain showers,"
1445,,Has mingled many a dedicative vow
1446,,"That holds him, till thy last delight be known,"
1447,,Bound in thy service and in thine alone.
1448,,
1449,,"I, too, among the visionary throng"
1450,,"Who choose to follow where thy pathway leads,"
1451,,"Have sold my patrimony for a song,"
1452,,"And donned the simple, lowly pilgrim's weeds."
1453,,"From that first image of beloved walls,"
1454,,"Deep-bowered in umbrage of ancestral trees,"
1455,,"Where earliest thy sweet enchantment falls,"
1456,,Tingeing a child's fantastic reveries
1457,,With radiance so fair it seems to be
1458,,Of heavens just lost the lingering evidence
1459,,"From that first dawn of roseate infancy,"
1460,,So long beneath thy tender influence
1461,,My breast has thrilled.  As oft for one brief second
1462,,The veil through which those infinite offers beckoned
1463,,"Has seemed to tremble, letting through"
1464,,Some swift intolerable view
1465,,"Of vistas past the sense of mortal seeing,"
1466,,"So oft, as one whose stricken eyes might see"
1467,,"In ferny dells the rustic deity,"
1468,,"I stood, like him, possessed, and all my being,"
1469,,"Flooded an instant with unwonted light,"
1470,,Quivered with cosmic passion; whether then
1471,,On woody pass or glistening mountain-height
1472,,"I walked in fellowship with winds and clouds,"
1473,,"Whether in cities and the throngs of men,"
1474,,"A curious saunterer through friendly crowds,"
1475,,"Enamored of the glance in passing eyes,"
1476,,"Unuttered salutations, mute replies, --"
1477,,In every character where light of thine
1478,,Has shed on earthly things the hue of things divine
1479,,"I sought eternal Loveliness, and seeking,"
1480,,If ever transport crossed my brow bespeaking
1481,,Such fire as a prophetic heart might feel
1482,,"Where simple worship blends in fervent zeal,"
1483,,It was the faith that only love of thee
1484,,Needed in human hearts for Earth to see
1485,,Surpassed the vision poets have held dear
1486,,Of joy diffused in most communion here;
1487,,"That whomsoe'er thy visitations warmed,"
1488,,"Lover of thee in all thy rays informed,"
1489,,Needed no difficulter discipline
1490,,To seek his right to happiness within
1491,,"Than, sensible of Nature's loveliness,"
1492,,To yield him to the generous impulses
1493,,"By such a sentiment evoked.  The thought,"
1494,,"Bright Spirit, whose illuminings I sought,"
1495,,That thou unto thy worshipper might be
1496,,"An all-sufficient law, abode with me,"
1497,,Importing something more than unsubstantial dreams
1498,,To vigils by lone shores and walks by murmuring streams.
1499,,
1500,,Youth's flowers like childhood's fade and are forgot.
1501,,Fame twines a tardy crown of yellowing leaves.
1502,,"How swift were disillusion, were it not"
1503,,That thou art steadfast where all else deceives!
1504,,"Solace and Inspiration, Power divine"
1505,,"That by some mystic sympathy of thine,"
1506,,"When least it waits and most hath need of thee,"
1507,,Can startle the dull spirit suddenly
1508,,"With grandeur welled from unsuspected springs, --"
1509,,"Long as the light of fulgent evenings,"
1510,,When from warm showers the pearly shades disband
1511,,"And sunset opens o'er the humid land,"
1512,,"Shows thy veiled immanence in orient skies, --"
1513,,Long as pale mist and opalescent dyes
1514,,"Hung on far isle or vanishing mountain-crest,"
1515,,Fields of remote enchantment can suggest
1516,,"So sweet to wander in it matters nought,"
1517,,"They hold no place but in impassioned thought,"
1518,,Long as one draught from a clear sky may be
1519,,A scented luxury;
1520,,"Be thou my worship, thou my sole desire,"
1521,,"Thy paths my pilgrimage, my sense a lyre"
1522,,Aeolian for thine every breath to stir;
1523,,"Oft when her full-blown periods recur,"
1524,,To see the birth of day's transparent moon
1525,,Far from cramped walls may fading afternoon
1526,,Find me expectant on some rising lawn;
1527,,"Often depressed in dewy grass at dawn,"
1528,,"Me, from sweet slumber underneath green boughs,"
1529,,"Ere the stars flee may forest matins rouse,"
1530,,Afoot when the great sun in amber floods
1531,,Pours horizontal through the steaming woods
1532,,And windless fumes from early chimneys start
1533,,And many a cock-crow cheers the traveller's heart
1534,,Eager for aught the coming day afford
1535,,In hills untopped and valleys unexplored.
1536,,"Give me the white road into the world's ends,"
1537,,"Lover of roadside hazard, roadside friends,"
1538,,Loiterer oft by upland farms to gaze
1539,,"On ample prospects, lost in glimmering haze"
1540,,"At noon, or where down odorous dales twilit,"
1541,,"Filled with low thundering of the mountain stream,"
1542,,Over the plain where blue seas border it
1543,,The torrid coast-towns gleam.
1544,,
1545,,I have fared too far to turn back now; my breast
1546,,"Burns with the lust for splendors unrevealed,"
1547,,"Stars of midsummer, clouds out of the west,"
1548,,"Pallid horizons, winds that valley and field"
1549,,"Laden with joy, be ye my refuge still!"
1550,,What though distress and poverty assail!
1551,,"Though other voices chide, yours never will."
1552,,The grace of a blue sky can never fail.
1553,,"Powers that my childhood with a spell so sweet,"
1554,,"My youth with visions of such glory nursed,"
1555,,"Ye have beheld, nor ever seen my feet"
1556,,"On any venture set, but 'twas the thirst"
1557,,"For Beauty willed them, yea, whatever be"
1558,,The faults I wanted wings to rise above;
1559,,I am cheered yet to think how steadfastly
1560,,I have been loyal to the love of Love!
1561,,
1562,,
1563,,
1564,,
1565,,The Deserted Garden
1566,,
1567,,
1568,,I know a village in a far-off land
1569,,"Where from a sunny, mountain-girdled plain"
1570,,With tinted walls a space on either hand
1571,,And fed by many an olive-darkened lane
1572,,"The high-road mounts, and thence a silver band"
1573,,"Through vineyard slopes above and rolling grain,"
1574,,Winds off to that dim corner of the skies
1575,,Where behind sunset hills a stately city lies.
1576,,
1577,,"Here, among trees whose overhanging shade"
1578,,"Strews petals on the little droves below,"
1579,,Pattering townward in the morning weighed
1580,,"With greens from many an upland garden-row,"
1581,,Runs an old wall; long centuries have frayed
1582,,"Its scalloped edge, and passers to and fro"
1583,,Heard never from beyond its crumbling height
1584,,Sweet laughter ring at noon or plaintive song at night.
1585,,
1586,,But here where little lizards bask and blink
1587,,"The tendrils of the trumpet-vine have run,"
1588,,At whose red bells the humming bird to drink
1589,,Stops oft before his garden feast is done;
1590,,"And rose-geraniums, with that tender pink"
1591,,"That cloud-banks borrow from the setting sun,"
1592,,"Have covered part of this old wall, entwined"
1593,,"With fair plumbago, blue as evening heavens behind."
1594,,
1595,,And crowning other parts the wild white rose
1596,,Rivals the honey-suckle with the bees.
1597,,Above the old abandoned orchard shows
1598,,"And all within beneath the dense-set trees,"
1599,,"Tall and luxuriant the rank grass grows,"
1600,,That settled in its wavy depth one sees
1601,,"Grass melt in leaves, the mossy trunks between,"
1602,,Down fading avenues of implicated green;
1603,,
1604,,Wherein no lack of flowers the verdurous night
1605,,With stars and pearly nebula o'erlay;
1606,,Azalea-boughs half rosy and half white
1607,,"Shine through the green and clustering apple-spray,"
1608,,Such as the fairy-queen before her knight
1609,,"Waved in old story, luring him away"
1610,,Where round lost isles Hesperian billows break
1611,,"Or towers loom up beneath the clear, translucent lake;"
1612,,
1613,,"And under the deep grass blue hare-bells hide,"
1614,,"And myrtle plots with dew-fall ever wet,"
1615,,"Gay tiger-lilies flammulate and pied,"
1616,,"Sometime on pathway borders neatly set,"
1617,,"Now blossom through the brake on either side,"
1618,,"Where heliotrope and weedy mignonette,"
1619,,"With vines in bloom and flower-bearing trees,"
1620,,"Mingle their incense all to swell the perfumed breeze,"
1621,,
1622,,That sprung like Hermes from his natal cave
1623,,"In some blue rampart of the curving West,"
1624,,"Comes up the valleys where green cornfields wave,"
1625,,"Ravels the cloud about the mountain crest,"
1626,,Breathes on the lake till gentle ripples pave
1627,,"Its placid floor; at length a long-loved guest,"
1628,,"He steals across this plot of pleasant ground,"
1629,,Waking the vocal leaves to a sweet vernal sound.
1630,,
1631,,"Here many a day right gladly have I sped,"
1632,,"Content amid the wavy plumes to lie,"
1633,,And through the woven branches overhead
1634,,"Watch the white, ever-wandering clouds go by,"
1635,,And soaring birds make their dissolving bed
1636,,"Far in the azure depths of summer sky,"
1637,,"Or nearer that small huntsman of the air,"
1638,,"The fly-catcher, dart nimbly from his leafy lair;"
1639,,
1640,,Pillowed at ease to hear the merry tune
1641,,Of mating warblers in the boughs above
1642,,And shrill cicadas whom the hottest noon
1643,,Keeps not from drowsy song; the mourning dove
1644,,Pours down the murmuring grove his plaintive croon
1645,,That like the voice of visionary love
1646,,Oft have I risen to seek through this green maze
1647,,(Even as my feet thread now the great world's garden-ways);
1648,,
1649,,"And, parting tangled bushes as I passed"
1650,,"Down beechen alleys beautiful and dim,"
1651,,Perhaps by some deep-shaded pool at last
1652,,"My feet would pause, where goldfish poise and swim,"
1653,,And snowy callas' velvet cups are massed
1654,,"Around the mossy, fern-encircled brim."
1655,,"Here, then, that magic summoning would cease,"
1656,,Or sound far off again among the orchard trees.
1657,,
1658,,And here where the blanched lilies of the vale
1659,,"And violets and yellow star-flowers teem,"
1660,,And pink and purple hyacinths exhale
1661,,"Their heavy fume, once more to drowse and dream"
1662,,"My head would sink, from many an olden tale"
1663,,"Drawing imagination's fervid theme,"
1664,,Or haply peopling this enchanting spot
1665,,Only with fair creations of fantastic thought.
1666,,
1667,,"For oft I think, in years long since gone by,"
1668,,That gentle hearts dwelt here and gentle hands
1669,,Stored all this bowery bliss to beautify
1670,,The paradise of some unsung romance;
1671,,"Here, safe from all except the loved one's eye,"
1672,,"'Tis sweet to think white limbs were wont to glance,"
1673,,Well pleased to wanton like the flowers and share
1674,,Their simple loveliness with the enamored air.
1675,,
1676,,Thrice dear to them whose votive fingers decked
1677,,"The altars of First Love were these green ways, --"
1678,,These lawns and verdurous brakes forever flecked
1679,,With the warm sunshine of midsummer days;
1680,,Oft where the long straight allies intersect
1681,,"And marble seats surround the open space,"
1682,,"Where a tiled pool and sculptured fountain stand,"
1683,,"Hath Evening found them seated, silent, hand in hand."
1684,,
1685,,"When twilight deepened, in the gathering shade"
1686,,"Beneath that old titanic cypress row,"
1687,,Whose sombre vault and towering colonnade
1688,,"Dwarfed the enfolded forms that moved below,"
1689,,"Oft with close steps these happy lovers strayed,"
1690,,Till down its darkening aisle the sunset glow
1691,,Grew less and patterning the garden floor
1692,,Faint flakes of filtering moonlight mantled more and more.
1693,,
1694,,And the strange tempest that a touch imparts
1695,,"Through the mid fibre of the molten frame,"
1696,,When the sweet flesh in early youth asserts
1697,,"Its heyday verve and little hints enflame,"
1698,,Disturbed them as they walked; from their full hearts
1699,,"Welled the soft word, and many a tender name"
1700,,Strove on their lips as breast to breast they strained
1701,,"And the deep joy they drank seemed never, never drained."
1702,,
1703,,Love's soul that is the depth of starry skies
1704,,Set in the splendor of one upturned face
1705,,To beam adorably through half-closed eyes;
1706,,Love's body where the breadth of summer days
1707,,And all the beauty earth and air comprise
1708,,"Come to the compass of an arm's embrace,"
1709,,To burn a moment on impassioned lips
1710,,"And yield intemperate joy to quivering finger-tips,"
1711,,
1712,,They knew; and here where morning-glories cling
1713,,"Round carven forms of carefullest artifice,"
1714,,They made a bower where every outward thing
1715,,Should comment on the cause of their own bliss;
1716,,With flowers of liveliest hue encompassing
1717,,That flower that the beloved body is --
1718,,That rose that for the banquet of Love's bee
1719,,Has budded all the aeons of past eternity.
1720,,
1721,,"But their choice seat was where the garden wall,"
1722,,"Crowning a little summit, far and near,"
1723,,Looks over tufted treetops onto all
1724,,The pleasant outer country; rising here
1725,,From rustling foliage where cuckoos call
1726,,"On summer evenings, stands a belvedere,"
1727,,"Buff-hued, of antique plaster, overrun"
1728,,With flowering vines and weatherworn by rain and sun.
1729,,
1730,,Still round the turrets of this antique tower
1731,,"The bougainvillea hangs a crimson crown,"
1732,,"Wistaria-vines and clematis in flower,"
1733,,"Wreathing the lower surface further down,"
1734,,Hide the old plaster in a very shower
1735,,Of motley blossoms like a broidered gown.
1736,,"Outside, ascending from the garden grove,"
1737,,A crumbling stairway winds to the one room above.
1738,,
1739,,And whoso mounts by this dismantled stair
1740,,"Finds the old pleasure-hall, long disarrayed,"
1741,,"Brick-tiled and raftered, and the walls foursquare"
1742,,Ringed all about with a twofold arcade.
1743,,Backward dense branches intercept the glare
1744,,Of afternoon with eucalyptus shade;
1745,,"Eastward the level valley-plains expand,"
1746,,Sweet as a queen's survey of her own Fairyland.
1747,,
1748,,"For through that frame the ivied arches make,"
1749,,"Wide tracts of sunny midland charm the eye,"
1750,,"Frequent with hamlet, grove, and lucent lake"
1751,,Where the blue hills' inverted contours lie;
1752,,Far to the east where billowy mountains break
1753,,"In surf of snow against a sapphire sky,"
1754,,"Huge thunderheads loom up behind the ranges,"
1755,,Changing from gold to pink as deepening sunset changes;
1756,,
1757,,And over plain and far sierra spread
1758,,"The fulgent rays of fading afternoon,"
1759,,Showing each utmost peak and watershed
1760,,"All clarified, each tassel and festoon"
1761,,"Of floating cloud embroidered overhead,"
1762,,"Like lotus-leaves on bluest waters strewn,"
1763,,"Flushing with rose, while all breathes fresh and free"
1764,,In peace and amplitude and bland tranquillity.
1765,,
1766,,Dear were such evenings to this gentle pair;
1767,,Love's tide that launched on with a blast too strong
1768,,"Sweeps toward the foaming reef, the hidden snare,"
1769,,"Baffling with fond illusion's siren-song,"
1770,,"Too faint, on idle shoals, to linger there"
1771,,"Far from Youth's glowing dream, bore them along,"
1772,,With purple sail and steered by seraph hands
1773,,To isles resplendent in the sunset of romance.
1774,,
1775,,"And out of this old house a flowery fane,"
1776,,"A bridal bower, a pearly pleasure-dome,"
1777,,"They built, and furnished it with gold and grain,"
1778,,"And bade all spirits of beauty hither come,"
1779,,And winged Love to enter with his train
1780,,"And bless their pillow, and in this his home"
1781,,Make them his priests as Hero was of yore
1782,,In her sweet girlhood by the blue Dardanian shore.
1783,,
1784,,"Tree-ferns, therefore, and potted palms they brought,"
1785,,"Tripods and urns in rare and curious taste,"
1786,,Polychrome chests and cabinets inwrought
1787,,With pearl and ivory etched and interlaced;
1788,,"Pendant brocades with massive braid were caught,"
1789,,"And chain-slung, oriental lamps so placed"
1790,,"To light the lounger on some low divan,"
1791,,Sunken in swelling down and silks from Hindustan.
1792,,
1793,,"And there was spread, upon the ample floors,"
1794,,"Work of the Levantine's laborious loom,"
1795,,Such as by Euxine or Ionian shores
1796,,Carpets the dim seraglio's scented gloom.
1797,,"Each morn renewed, the garden's flowery stores"
1798,,"Blushed in fair vases, ochre and peach-bloom,"
1799,,And little birds through wicker doors left wide
1800,,Flew in to trill a space from the green world outside.
1801,,
1802,,"And there was many a dainty attitude,"
1803,,"Bronze and eburnean.  All but disarrayed,"
1804,,Here in eternal doubt sweet Psyche stood
1805,,"Fain of the bath's delight, yet still afraid"
1806,,Lest aught in that palatial solitude
1807,,Lurked of most menace to a helpless maid.
1808,,"Therefore forever faltering she stands,"
1809,,Nor yet the last loose fold slips rippling from her hands.
1810,,
1811,,"Close by upon a beryl column, clad"
1812,,"In the fresh flower of adolescent grace,"
1813,,"They set the dear Bithynian shepherd lad,"
1814,,"The nude Antinous.  That gentle face,"
1815,,"Forever beautiful, forever sad,"
1816,,"Shows but one aspect, moon-like, to our gaze,"
1817,,Yet Fancy pictures how those lips could smile
1818,,"At revelries in Rome, and banquets on the Nile."
1819,,
1820,,"And there were shapes of Beauty myriads more,"
1821,,"Clustering their rosy bridal bed around,"
1822,,Whose scented breadth a silken fabric wore
1823,,"Broidered with peacock hues on creamiest ground,"
1824,,Fit to have graced the barge that Cydnus bore
1825,,"Or Venus' bed in her enchanted mound,"
1826,,"While pillows swelled in stuffs of Orient dyes,"
1827,,All broidered with strange fruits and birds of Paradise.
1828,,
1829,,"'Twas such a bower as Youth has visions of,"
1830,,"Thither with one fair spirit to retire,"
1831,,"Lie upon rose-leaves, sleep and wake with Love"
1832,,And feast on kisses to the heart's desire;
1833,,"Where by a casement opening on a grove,"
1834,,"Wide to the wood-winds and the sweet birds' choir,"
1835,,"A girl might stand and gaze into green boughs,"
1836,,Like Credhe at the window of her golden house.
1837,,
1838,,"Or most like Vivien, the enchanting fay,"
1839,,"Where with her friend, in the strange tower they planned,"
1840,,"She lies and dreams eternity away,"
1841,,"Above the treetops in Broceliande,"
1842,,Sometimes at twilight when the woods are gray
1843,,"And wolf-packs howl far out across the lande,"
1844,,"Waking to love, while up behind the trees"
1845,,The large midsummer moon lifts--even so loved these.
1846,,
1847,,"For here, their pleasure was to come and sit"
1848,,"Oft when the sun sloped midway to the west,"
1849,,Watching with sweet enjoyment interknit
1850,,"The long light slant across the green earth's breast,"
1851,,"And clouds upon the ranges opposite,"
1852,,"Rolled up into a gleaming thundercrest,"
1853,,"Topple and break and fall in purple rain,"
1854,,And mist of summer showers trail out across the plain.
1855,,
1856,,"Whereon the shafts of ardent light, far-flung"
1857,,"Across the luminous azure overhead,"
1858,,Ofttimes in arcs of transient beauty hung
1859,,The fragmentary rainbow's green and red.
1860,,"Joy it was here to love and to be young,"
1861,,"To watch the sun sink to his western bed,"
1862,,And streaming back out of their flaming core
1863,,The vesperal aurora's glorious banners soar.
1864,,
1865,,"Tinging each altitude of heaven in turn,"
1866,,Those fiery rays would sweep.  The cumuli
1867,,That peeped above the mountain-tops would burn
1868,,"Carmine a space; the cirrus-whorls on high,"
1869,,"More delicate than sprays of maiden fern,"
1870,,"Streak with pale rose the peacock-breasted sky,"
1871,,"Then blanch.  As water-lilies fold at night,"
1872,,Sank back into themselves those plumes of fervid light.
1873,,
1874,,"And they would watch the first faint stars appear,"
1875,,"The blue East blend with the blue hills below,"
1876,,As lovers when their shuddering bliss draws near
1877,,Into one pulse of fluid rapture grow.
1878,,New fragrance on the freshening atmosphere
1879,,"Would steal with evening, and the sunset glow"
1880,,Draw deeper down into the wondrous west
1881,,Round vales of Proserpine and islands of the blest.
1882,,
1883,,"So dusk would come and mingle lake and shore,"
1884,,"The snow-peaks fade to frosty opaline,"
1885,,"To pearl the domed clouds the mountains bore,"
1886,,Where late the sun's effulgent fire had been --
1887,,Showing as darkness deepened more and more
1888,,"The incandescent lightnings flare within,"
1889,,And Night that furls the lily in the glen
1890,,"And twines impatient arms would fall, and then--and then . . ."
1891,,
1892,,"Sometimes the peasant, coming late from town"
1893,,With empty panniers on his little drove
1894,,Past the old lookout when the Northern Crown
1895,,"Glittered with Cygnus through the scented grove,"
1896,,Would hear soft noise of lute-strings wafted down
1897,,And voices singing through the leaves above
1898,,Those songs that well from the warm heart that woos
1899,,At balconies in Merida or Vera Cruz.
1900,,
1901,,"And he would pause under the garden wall,"
1902,,"Caught in the spell of that voluptuous strain,"
1903,,"With all the sultry South in it, and all"
1904,,Its importunity of love and pain;
1905,,And he would wait till the last passionate fall
1906,,"Died on the night, and all was still again, --"
1907,,"Then to his upland village wander home,"
1908,,Marvelling whence that flood of elfin song might come.
1909,,
1910,,"O lyre that Love's white holy hands caress,"
1911,,"Youth, from thy bosom welled their passionate lays --"
1912,,Sweet opportunity for happiness
1913,,"So brief, so passing beautiful--O days,"
1914,,When to the heart's divine indulgences
1915,,All earth in smiling ministration pays --
1916,,"Thine was the source whose plenitude, past over,"
1917,,"What prize shall rest to pluck, what secret to discover!"
1918,,
1919,,The wake of color that follows her when May
1920,,"Walks on the hills loose-haired and daisy-crowned,"
1921,,"The deep horizons of a summer's day,"
1922,,"Fair cities, and the pleasures that abound"
1923,,"Where music calls, and crowds in bright array"
1924,,Gather by night to find and to be found;
1925,,What were these worth or all delightful things
1926,,Without thine eyes to read their true interpretings!
1927,,
1928,,"For thee the mountains open glorious gates,"
1929,,"To thee white arms put out from orient skies,"
1930,,"Earth, like a jewelled bride for one she waits,"
1931,,"Decks but to be delicious in thine eyes,"
1932,,"Thou guest of honor for one day, whose fetes"
1933,,Eternity has travailed to devise;
1934,,"Ah, grace them well in the brief hour they last!"
1935,,"Another's turn prepares, another follows fast."
1936,,
1937,,Yet not without one fond memorial
1938,,Let my sun set who found the world so fair!
1939,,"Frail verse, when Time the singer's coronal"
1940,,"Has rent, and stripped the rose-leaves from his hair,"
1941,,Be thou my tablet on the temple wall!
1942,,"Among the pious testimonials there,"
1943,,Witness how sweetly on my heart as well
1944,,The miracles of dawn and starry evening fell!
1945,,
1946,,"Speak of one then who had the lust to feel,"
1947,,"And, from the hues that far horizons take,"
1948,,"And cloud and sunset, drank the wild appeal,"
1949,,"Too deep to live for aught but life's sweet sake,"
1950,,Whose only motive was the will to kneel
1951,,"Where Beauty's purest benediction spake,"
1952,,Who only coveted what grove and field
1953,,And sunshine and green Earth and tender arms could yield --
1954,,
1955,,"A nympholept, through pleasant days and drear"
1956,,"Seeking his faultless adolescent dream,"
1957,,A pilgrim down the paths that disappear
1958,,"In mist and rainbows on the world's extreme,"
1959,,A helpless voyager who all too near
1960,,"The mouth of Life's fair flower-bordered stream,"
1961,,Clutched at Love's single respite in his need
1962,,More than the drowning swimmer clutches at a reed --
1963,,
1964,,That coming one whose feet in other days
1965,,"Shall bleed like mine for ever having, more"
1966,,"Than any purpose, felt the need to praise"
1967,,"And seek the angelic image to adore,"
1968,,"In love with Love, its wonderful, sweet ways"
1969,,"Counting what most makes life worth living for,"
1970,,That so some relic may be his to see
1971,,How I loved these things too and they were dear to me.
1972,,
1973,,I sometimes think a conscious happiness
1974,,Mantles through all the rose's sentient vine
1975,,When summer winds with myriad calyces
1976,,Of bloom its clambering height incarnadine;
1977,,"I sometimes think that cleaving lips, no less,"
1978,,And limbs that crowned desires at length entwine
1979,,"Are nerves through which that being drinks delight,"
1980,,Whose frame is the green Earth robed round with day and night.
1981,,
1982,,"And such were theirs:  the traveller without,"
1983,,"Pausing at night under the orchard trees,"
1984,,"Wondered and crossed himself in holy doubt,"
1985,,For through their song and in the murmuring breeze
1986,,It seemed angelic choirs were all about
1987,,"Mingling in universal harmonies,"
1988,,"As though, responsive to the chords they woke,"
1989,,All Nature into sweet epithalamium broke.
1990,,
1991,,And still they think a spirit haunts the place:
1992,,"'Tis said, when Night has drawn her jewelled pall"
1993,,And through the branches twinkling fireflies trace
1994,,"Their mimic constellations, if it fall"
1995,,That one should see the moon rise through the lace
1996,,"Of blossomy boughs above the garden wall,"
1997,,That surely would he take great ill thereof
1998,,And famish in a fit of unexpressive love.
1999,,
2000,,"But this I know not, for what time the wain"
2001,,"Was loosened and the lily's petal furled,"
2002,,"Then I would rise, climb the old wall again,"
2003,,"And pausing look forth on the sundown world,"
2004,,"Scan the wide reaches of the wondrous plain,"
2005,,"The hamlet sites where settling smoke lay curled,"
2006,,"The poplar-bordered roads, and far away"
2007,,Fair snowpeaks colored with the sun's last ray.
2008,,
2009,,Waves of faint sound would pulsate from afar --
2010,,Faint song and preludes of the summer night;
2011,,Deep in the cloudless west the evening star
2012,,Hung 'twixt the orange and the emerald light;
2013,,From the dark vale where shades crepuscular
2014,,"Dimmed the old grove-girt belfry glimmering white,"
2015,,"Throbbing, as gentlest breezes rose or fell,"
2016,,Came the sweet invocation of the evening bell.

2025,,"Came sleeved in vapors and miasmal dew,"
2026,,"Curling across the jungle's ferny floor,"
2027,,"Becking each fevered brain.  On bleak divides,"
2028,,Where Sleep grew niggardly for nipping cold
2029,,"That twinged blue lips into a mouthed curse,"
2030,,Not back to Seville and its sunny plains
2031,,"Winged their brief-biding dreams, but once again,"
2032,,"Lords of a palace in Tenochtitlan,"
2033,,They guarded Montezuma's treasure-hoard.
2034,,"Gold, like some finny harvest of the sea,"
2035,,"Poured out knee deep around the rifted floors,"
2036,,"Shiny and sparkling,--arms and crowns and rings:"
2037,,"Gold, sweet to toy with as beloved hair, --"
2038,,"To plunge the lustful, crawling fingers down,"
2039,,"Arms elbow deep, and draw them out again,"
2040,,"And watch the glinting metal trickle off,"
2041,,"Even as at night some fisherman, home bound"
2042,,With speckled cargo in his hollow keel
2043,,"Caught off Campeche or the Isle of Pines,"
2044,,"Dips in his paddle, lifts it forth again,"
2045,,And laughs to see the luminous white drops
2046,,Fall back in flakes of fire. . . .  Gold was the dream
2047,,That cheered that desperate enterprise.  And now? . . .
2048,,"Victory waited on the arms of Spain,"
2049,,"Fallen was the lovely city by the lake,"
2050,,The sunny Venice of the western world;
2051,,"There many corpses, rotting in the wind,"
2052,,"Poked up stiff limbs, but in the leprous rags"
2053,,"No jewel caught the sun, no tawny chain"
2054,,"Gleamed, as the prying halberds raked them o'er."
2055,,Pillage that ran red-handed through the streets
2056,,Came railing home at evening empty-palmed;
2057,,"And they, on that sad night a twelvemonth gone,"
2058,,"Who, ounce by ounce, dear as their own life's blood"
2059,,"Retreating, cast the cumbrous load away:"
2060,,"They, when brown foemen lopped the bridges down,"
2061,,Who tipped thonged chests into the stream below
2062,,And over wealth that might have ransomed kings
2063,,"Passed on to safety;--cheated, guerdonless --"
2064,,Found (through their fingers the bright booty slipped)
2065,,"A city naked, of that golden dream"
2066,,Shorn in one moment like a sunset sky.
2067,,
2068,,Deep in a chamber that no cheerful ray
2069,,"Purged of damp air, where in unbroken night"
2070,,"Black scorpions nested in the sooty beams,"
2071,,Helpless and manacled they led him down --
2072,,Cuauhtemotzin--and other lords beside --
2073,,"All chieftains of the people, heroes all --"
2074,,And stripped their feathered robes and bound them there
2075,,"On short stone settles sloping to the head,"
2076,,"But where the feet projected, underneath"
2077,,"Heaped the red coals.  Their swarthy fronts illumed,"
2078,,"The bearded Spaniards, helmed and haubergeoned,"
2079,,Paced up and down beneath the lurid vault.
2080,,Some kneeling fanned the glowing braziers; some
2081,,Stood at the sufferers' heads and all the while
2082,,"Hissed in their ears:  ""The gold . . . the gold . . . the gold."
2083,,Where have ye hidden it--the chested gold?
2084,,"Speak--and the torments cease!"""
2085,,
2086,,They answered not.
2087,,Past those proud lips whose key their sovereign claimed
2088,,"No accent fell to chide or to betray,"
2089,,Only it chanced that bound beside the king
2090,,"Lay one whom Nature, more than other men"
2091,,"Framing for delicate and perfumed ease,"
2092,,"Not yet, along the happy ways of Youth,"
2093,,Had weaned from gentle usages so far
2094,,To teach that fortitude that warriors feel
2095,,"And glory in the proof.  He answered not,"
2096,,"But writhing with intolerable pain,"
2097,,"Convulsed in every limb, and all his face"

2102,,For leave--for leave to utter it--one sign --
2103,,One word--one little word--to ease his pain.
2104,,
2105,,"As one reclining in the banquet hall,"
2106,,"Propped on an elbow, garlanded with flowers,"
2107,,Saw lust and greed and boisterous revelry
2108,,"Surge round him on the tides of wine, but he,"
2109,,Staunch in the ethic of an antique school --
2110,,Stoic or Cynic or of Pyrrho's mind --
2111,,"With steady eyes surveyed the unbridled scene,"
2112,,"Himself impassive, silent, self-contained:"
2113,,"So sat the Indian prince, with brow unblanched,"
2114,,Amid the tortured and the torturers.
2115,,"He who had seen his hopes made desolate,"
2116,,"His realm despoiled, his early crown deprived him,"
2117,,And watched while Pestilence and Famine piled
2118,,"His stricken people in their reeking doors,"
2119,,Whence glassy eyes looked out and lean brown arms
2120,,Stretched up to greet him in one last farewell
2121,,As back and forth he paced along the streets
2122,,With words of hopeless comfort--what was this
2123,,That one should weaken now?  He weakened not.
2124,,"Whate'er was in his heart, he neither dealt"
2125,,"In pity nor in scorn, but, turning round,"
2126,,"Met that racked visage with his own unmoved,"
2127,,"Bent on the sufferer his mild calm eyes,"
2128,,"And while the pangs smote sharper, in a voice,"
2129,,As who would speak not all in gentleness
2130,,"Nor all disdain, said:  ""Yes!  And am -I- then"
2131,,"Upon a bed of roses?"""
2132,,
2133,,Stung with shame --
2134,,Shame bitterer than his anguish--to betray
2135,,"Such cowardice before the man he loved,"
2136,,"And merit such rebuke, the boy grew calm;"
2137,,"And stilled his struggling limbs and moaning cries,"
2138,,"And shook away his tears, and strove to smile,"
2139,,And turned his face against the wall--and died.

2149,,"Timid, irresolute, yet dauntless still,"
2150,,"Who one bright dawn, when each remotest hill"
2151,,Stood sharp and clear in Heaven's unclouded blue
2152,,"And all Earth shimmered with fresh-beaded dew,"
2153,,"Risen in the first beams of the gladdening sun,"
2154,,Walked up into the mountains.  One by one
2155,,Each towering trunk beneath his sturdy stride
2156,,"Fell back, and ever wider and more wide"
2157,,"The boundless prospect opened.  Long he strayed,"
2158,,From dawn till the last trace of slanting shade
2159,,"Had vanished from the canyons, and, dismayed"
2160,,"At that far length to which his path had led,"
2161,,He paused--at such a height where overhead
2162,,"The clouds hung close, the air came thin and chill,"
2163,,"And all was hushed and calm and very still,"
2164,,"Save, from abysmal gorges, where the sound"
2165,,"Of tumbling waters rose, and all around"
2166,,"The pines, by those keen upper currents blown,"
2167,,Muttered in multitudinous monotone.
2168,,"Here, with the wind in lovely locks laid bare,"
2169,,"With arms oft raised in dedicative prayer,"
2170,,"Lost in mute rapture and adoring wonder,"
2171,,"He stood, till the far noise of noontide thunder,"
2172,,Rolled down upon the muffled harmonies
2173,,"Of wind and waterfall and whispering trees,"
2174,,Made loneliness more lone.  Some Panic fear
2175,,"Would seize him then, as they who seemed to hear"
2176,,In Tracian valleys or Thessalian woods
2177,,The god's hallooing wake the leafy solitudes;
2178,,I think it was the same:  some piercing sense
2179,,"Of Deity's pervasive immanence,"
2180,,The Life that visible Nature doth indwell
2181,,Grown great and near and all but palpable . . .
2182,,"He might not linger, but with winged strides"
2183,,"Like one pursued, fled down the mountain-sides --"
2184,,"Down the long ridge that edged the steep ravine,"
2185,,"By glade and flowery lawn and upland green,"
2186,,And never paused nor felt assured again
2187,,"But where the grassy foothills opened.  Then,"
2188,,While shadows lengthened on the plain below
2189,,And the sun vanished and the sunset-glow
2190,,Looked back upon the world with fervid eye
2191,,"Through the barred windows of the western sky,"
2192,,"Homeward he fared, while many a look behind"
2193,,"Showed the receding ranges dim-outlined,"
2194,,"Highland and hollow where his path had lain,"
2195,,Veiled in deep purple of the mountain rain.

2201,,
2202,,
2203,,To see the clouds his spirit yearned toward so
2204,,"Over new mountains piled and unploughed waves,"
2205,,Back of old-storied spires and architraves
2206,,"To watch Arcturus rise or Fomalhaut,"
2207,,
2208,,And roused by street-cries in strange tongues when day
2209,,"Flooded with gold some domed metropolis,"
2210,,Between new towers to waken and new bliss
2211,,Spread on his pillow in a wondrous way:
2212,,
2213,,"These were his joys.  Oft under bulging crates,"
2214,,"Coming to market with his morning load,"
2215,,The peasant found him early on his road
2216,,"To greet the sunrise at the city-gates, --"
2217,,
2218,,"There where the meadows waken in its rays,"
2219,,"Golden with mist, and the great roads commence,"
2220,,"And backward, where the chimney-tops are dense,"
2221,,Cathedral-arches glimmer through the haze.
2222,,
2223,,"White dunes that breaking show a strip of sea,"
2224,,"A plowman and his team against the blue,"
2225,,"Swiss pastures musical with cowbells, too,"
2226,,"And poplar-lined canals in Picardie,"
2227,,
2228,,And coast-towns where the vultures back and forth
2229,,"Sail in the clear depths of the tropic sky,"
2230,,And swallows in the sunset where they fly
2231,,"Over gray Gothic cities in the north,"
2232,,
2233,,"And the wine-cellar and the chorus there,"
2234,,"The dance-hall and a face among the crowd, --"
2235,,Were all delights that made him sing aloud
2236,,For joy to sojourn in a world so fair.
2237,,
2238,,Back of his footsteps as he journeyed fell
2239,,Range after range; ahead blue hills emerged.
2240,,Before him tireless to applaud it surged
2241,,The sweet interminable spectacle.
2242,,
2243,,And like the west behind a sundown sea
2244,,"Shone the past joys his memory retraced,"
2245,,And bright as the blue east he always faced
2246,,Beckoned the loves and joys that were to be.
2247,,
2248,,From every branch a blossom for his brow
2249,,"He gathered, singing down Life's flower-lined road,"
2250,,And youth impelled his spirit as he strode
2251,,Like winged Victory on the galley's prow.
2252,,
2253,,"That Loveliness whose being sun and star,"
2254,,"Green Earth and dawn and amber evening robe,"

2259,,"From every pore of universal space,"
2260,,As the fair soul illumes the lovely face --
2261,,"That was his guest, his passion, his desire."
2262,,
2263,,His heart the love of Beauty held as hides

2273,,
2274,,The need to love that all the stars obey
2275,,Entered my heart and banished all beside.
2276,,Bare were the gardens where I used to stray;
2277,,Faded the flowers that one time satisfied.
2278,,
2279,,"Before the beauty of the west on fire,"
2280,,"The moonlit hills from cloister-casements viewed,"
2281,,"Cloud-like arose the image of desire,"
2282,,And cast out peace and maddened solitude.
2283,,
2284,,I sought the City and the hopes it held:
2285,,"With smoke and brooding vapors intercurled,"
2286,,As the thick roofs and walls close-paralleled
2287,,Shut out the fair horizons of the world --
2288,,
2289,,"A truant from the fields and rustic joy,"
2290,,In my changed thought that image even so
2291,,Shut out the gods I worshipped as a boy
2292,,And all the pure delights I used to know.
2293,,
2294,,Often the veil has trembled at some tide
2295,,Of lovely reminiscence and revealed
2296,,How much of beauty Nature holds beside
2297,,Sweet lips that sacrifice and arms that yield:
2298,,
2299,,"Clouds, window-framed, beyond the huddled eaves"
2300,,"When summer cumulates their golden chains,"
2301,,"Or from the parks the smell of burning leaves,"
2302,,"Fragrant of childhood in the country lanes,"
2303,,
2304,,An organ-grinder's melancholy tune
2305,,"In rainy streets, or from an attic sill"
2306,,The blue skies of a windy afternoon
2307,,Where our kites climbed once from some grassy hill:
2308,,
2309,,And my soul once more would be wrapped entire
2310,,In the pure peace and blessing of those years
2311,,Before the fierce infection of Desire
2312,,Had ravaged all the flesh.  Through starting tears
2313,,
2314,,"Shone that lost Paradise; but, if it did,"
2315,,Again ere long the prison-shades would fall
2316,,"That Youth condemns itself to walk amid,"
2317,,"So narrow, but so beautiful withal."
2318,,
2319,,"And I have followed Fame with less devotion,"
2320,,And kept no real ambition but to see
2321,,Rise from the foam of Nature's sunlit ocean
2322,,My dream of palpable divinity;
2323,,
2324,,And aught the world contends for to mine eye
2325,,Seemed not so real a meaning of success
2326,,As only once to clasp before I die
2327,,My vision of embodied happiness.
2328,,

2330,,
2331,,
2332,,El Extraviado
2333,,
2334,,
2335,,"Over the radiant ridges borne out on the offshore wind,"
2336,,I have sailed as a butterfly sails whose priming wings unfurled
2337,,Leave the familiar gardens and visited fields behind
2338,,To follow a cloud in the east rose-flushed on the rim of the world.
2339,,
2340,,I have strayed from the trodden highway for walking with upturned eyes
2341,,"On the way of the wind in the treetops, and the drift of the tinted rack."
2342,,For the will to be losing no wonder of sunny or starlit skies
2343,,I have chosen the sod for my pillow and a threadbare coat for my back.
2344,,
2345,,"Evening of ample horizons, opaline, delicate, pure,"
2346,,"Shadow of clouds on green valleys, trailed over meadows and trees,"
2347,,"Cities of ardent adventure where the harvests of Joy mature,"
2348,,"Forests whose murmuring voices are amorous prophecies,"
2349,,
2350,,"World of romance and profusion, still round my journey spread"
2351,,"The glamours, the glints, the enthralments, the nurture of one whose feet"
2352,,From hours unblessed by beauty nor lighted by love have fled
2353,,As the shade of the tomb on his pathway and the scent of the winding-sheet.
2354,,
2355,,I never could rest from roving nor put from my heart this need
2356,,"To be seeing how lovably Nature in flower and face hath wrought, --"
2357,,In flower and meadow and mountain and heaven where the white clouds breed
2358,,And the cunning of silken meshes where the heart's desire lies caught.
2359,,
2360,,"Over the azure expanses, on the offshore breezes borne,"
2361,,"I have sailed as a butterfly sails, nor recked where the impulse led,"
2362,,"Sufficed with the sunshine and freedom, the warmth and the summer morn,"
2363,,"The infinite glory surrounding, the infinite blue ahead."
2364,,
2365,,
2366,,
2367,,
2368,,La Nue
2369,,
2370,,
2371,,"Oft when sweet music undulated round,"
2372,,Like the full moon out of a perfumed sea
2373,,Thine image from the waves of blissful sound
2374,,Rose and thy sudden light illumined me.
2375,,
2376,,"And in the country, leaf and flower and air"
2377,,Would alter and the eternal shape emerge;
2378,,"Because they spoke of thee the fields seemed fair,"
2379,,And Joy to wait at the horizon's verge.
2380,,
2381,,The little cloud-gaps in the east that filled
2382,,Gray afternoons with bits of tenderest blue
2383,,Were windows in a palace pearly-silled
2384,,That thy voluptuous traits came glimmering through.
2385,,
2386,,"And in the city, dominant desire"
2387,,"For which men toil within its prison-bars,"
2388,,I watched thy white feet moving in the mire
2389,,And thy white forehead hid among the stars.
2390,,
2391,,"Mystical, feminine, provoking, nude,"
2392,,"Radiant there with rosy arms outspread,"
2393,,"Sum of fulfillment, sovereign attitude,"
2394,,"Sensual with laughing lips and thrown-back head,"
2395,,
2396,,"Draped in the rainbow on the summer hills,"
2397,,"Hidden in sea-mist down the hot coast-line,"
2398,,"Couched on the clouds that fiery sunset fills,"
2399,,"Blessed, remote, impersonal, divine;"
2400,,
2401,,"The gold all color and grace are folded o'er,"
2402,,"The warmth all beauty and tenderness embower, --"
2403,,"Thou quiverest at Nature's perfumed core,"
2404,,The pistil of a myriad-petalled flower.
2405,,
2406,,"Round thee revolves, illimitably wide,"
2407,,"The world's desire, as stars around their pole."
2408,,Round thee all earthly loveliness beside
2409,,"Is but the radiate, infinite aureole."
2410,,
2411,,Thou art the poem on the cosmic page --
2412,,In rubric written on its golden ground --
2413,,That Nature paints her flowers and foliage
2414,,And rich-illumined commentary round.
2415,,
2416,,Thou art the rose that the world's smiles and tears
2417,,Hover about like butterflies and bees.
2418,,Thou art the theme the music of the spheres
2419,,"Echoes in endless, variant harmonies."
2420,,
2421,,Thou art the idol in the altar-niche
2422,,"Faced by Love's congregated worshippers,"
2423,,Thou art the holy sacrament round which
2424,,The vast cathedral is the universe.
2425,,
2426,,"Thou art the secret in the crystal where,"
2427,,"For the last light upon the mystery Man,"
2428,,"In his lone tower and ultimate despair,"
2429,,Searched the gray-bearded Zoroastrian.
2430,,
2431,,"And soft and warm as in the magic sphere,"
2432,,"Deep-orbed as in its erubescent fire,"
2433,,"So in my heart thine image would appear,"
2434,,Curled round with the red flames of my desire.
2435,,
2436,,
2437,,
2438,,
2439,,All That's Not Love . . .
2440,,
2441,,
2442,,"All that's not love is the dearth of my days,"
2443,,"The leaves of the volume with rubric unwrit,"
2444,,"The temple in times without prayer, without praise,"
2445,,The altar unset and the candle unlit.
2446,,
2447,,Let me survive not the lovable sway
2448,,"Of early desire, nor see when it goes"
2449,,"The courts of Life's abbey in ivied decay,"
2450,,Whence sometime sweet anthems and incense arose.
2451,,
2452,,The delicate hues of its sevenfold rings
2453,,The rainbow outlives not; their yellow and blue
2454,,"The butterfly sees not dissolve from his wings,"
2455,,But even with their beauty life fades from them too.
2456,,
2457,,No more would I linger past Love's ardent bounds
2458,,"Nor live for aught else but the joy that it craves,"
2459,,"That, burden and essence of all that surrounds,"
2460,,Is the song in the wind and the smile on the waves.
2461,,
2462,,

2465,,Paris
2466,,
2467,,
2468,I,I
2469,I,
2470,I,"First, London, for its myriads; for its height,"
2471,I,Manhattan heaped in towering stalagmite;
2472,I,But Paris for the smoothness of the paths
2473,I,That lead the heart unto the heart's delight. . . .
2474,I,
2475,I,Fair loiterer on the threshold of those days
2476,I,When there's no lovelier prize the world displays
2477,I,"Than, having beauty and your twenty years,"
2478,I,"You have the means to conquer and the ways,"
2479,I,
2480,I,And coming where the crossroads separate
2481,I,"And down each vista glories and wonders wait,"
2482,I,Crowning each path with pinnacles so fair
2483,I,"You know not which to choose, and hesitate --"
2484,I,
2485,I,"Oh, go to Paris. . . .  In the midday gloom"
2486,I,Of some old quarter take a little room
2487,I,That looks off over Paris and its towers
2488,I,"From Saint Gervais round to the Emperor's Tomb, --"
2489,I,
2490,I,So high that you can hear a mating dove
2491,I,"Croon down the chimney from the roof above,"
2492,I,See Notre Dame and know how sweet it is
2493,I,To wake between Our Lady and our love.
2494,I,
2495,I,And have a little balcony to bring
2496,I,"Fair plants to fill with verdure and blossoming,"
2497,I,"That sparrows seek, to feed from pretty hands,"
2498,I,And swallows circle over in the Spring.
2499,I,
2500,I,There of an evening you shall sit at ease
2501,I,"In the sweet month of flowering chestnut-trees,"
2502,I,"There with your little darling in your arms,"
2503,I,Your pretty dark-eyed Manon or Louise.
2504,I,
2505,I,And looking out over the domes and towers
2506,I,"That chime the fleeting quarters and the hours,"
2507,I,While the bright clouds banked eastward back of them
2508,I,"Blush in the sunset, pink as hawthorn flowers,"
2509,I,
2510,I,"You cannot fail to think, as I have done,"
2511,I,"Some of life's ends attained, so you be one"
2512,I,Who measures life's attainment by the hours
2513,I,That Joy has rescued from oblivion.
2514,I,
2515,I,
2516,I,
2517,II,II
2518,II,
2519,II,Come out into the evening streets.  The green light lessens in the west.
2520,II,The city laughs and liveliest her fervid pulse of pleasure beats.
2521,II,
2522,II,The belfry on Saint Severin strikes eight across the smoking eaves:
2523,II,Come out under the lights and leaves
2524,II,to the Reine Blanche on Saint Germain. . . .
2525,II,
2526,II,Now crowded diners fill the floor of brasserie and restaurant.
2527,II,"Shrill voices cry ""L'Intransigeant,"" and corners echo ""Paris-Sport."""
2528,II,
2529,II,"Where rows of tables from the street are screened with shoots of box and bay,"
2530,II,The ragged minstrels sing and play and gather sous from those that eat.
2531,II,
2532,II,"And old men stand with menu-cards, inviting passers-by to dine"
2533,II,On the bright terraces that line the Latin Quarter boulevards. . . .
2534,II,
2535,II,"But, having drunk and eaten well, 'tis pleasant then to stroll along"
2536,II,And mingle with the merry throng that promenades on Saint Michel.
2537,II,
2538,II,Here saunter types of every sort.  The shoddy jostle with the chic:
2539,II,Turk and Roumanian and Greek; student and officer and sport;
2540,II,
2541,II,"Slavs with their peasant, Christ-like heads,"
2542,II,"and courtezans like powdered moths,"
2543,II,"And peddlers from Algiers, with cloths"
2544,II,bright-hued and stitched with golden threads;
2545,II,
2546,II,"And painters with big, serious eyes go rapt in dreams, fantastic shapes"
2547,II,In corduroys and Spanish capes and locks uncut and flowing ties;
2548,II,
2549,II,"And lovers wander two by two, oblivious among the press,"
2550,II,"And making one of them no less, all lovers shall be dear to you:"
2551,II,
2552,II,"All laughing lips you move among, all happy hearts that, knowing what"
2553,II,"Makes life worth while, have wasted not the sweet reprieve of being young."
2554,II,
2555,II,"""Comment ca va!""  ""Mon vieux!""  ""Mon cher!"""
2556,II,Friends greet and banter as they pass.
2557,II,"'Tis sweet to see among the mass comrades and lovers everywhere,"
2558,II,
2559,II,"A law that's sane, a Love that's free, and men of every birth and blood"
2560,II,Allied in one great brotherhood of Art and Joy and Poverty. . . .
2561,II,
2562,II,"The open cafe-windows frame loungers at their liqueurs and beer,"
2563,II,And walking past them one can hear fragments of Tosca and Boheme.
2564,II,
2565,II,"And in the brilliant-lighted door of cinemas the barker calls,"
2566,II,And lurid posters paint the walls with scenes of Love and crime and war.
2567,II,
2568,II,"But follow past the flaming lights, borne onward with the stream of feet,"
2569,II,Where Bullier's further up the street is marvellous on Thursday nights.
2570,II,
2571,II,Here all Bohemia flocks apace; you could not often find elsewhere
2572,II,So many happy heads and fair assembled in one time and place.
2573,II,
2574,II,"Under the glare and noise and heat the galaxy of dancing whirls,"
2575,II,"Smokers, with covered heads, and girls dressed in the costume of the street."
2576,II,
2577,II,From tables packed around the wall the crowds that drink and frolic there
2578,II,"Spin serpentines into the air far out over the reeking hall,"
2579,II,
2580,II,"That, settling where the coils unroll, tangle with pink and green and blue"
2581,II,"The crowds that rag to ""Hitchy-koo"" and boston to the ""Barcarole"". . . ."
2582,II,
2583,II,"Here Mimi ventures, at fifteen, to make her debut in romance,"
2584,II,And join her sisters in the dance and see the life that they have seen.
2585,II,
2586,II,"Her hair, a tight hat just allows to brush beneath the narrow brim,"
2587,II,"Docked, in the model's present whim, 'frise' and banged above the brows."
2588,II,
2589,II,"Uncorseted, her clinging dress with every step and turn betrays,"
2590,II,"In pretty and provoking ways her adolescent loveliness,"
2591,II,
2592,II,"As guiding Gaby or Lucile she dances, emulating them"
2593,II,In each disturbing stratagem and each lascivious appeal.
2594,II,
2595,II,"Each turn a challenge, every pose an invitation to compete,"
2596,II,"Along the maze of whirling feet the grave-eyed little wanton goes,"
2597,II,
2598,II,"And, flaunting all the hue that lies in childish cheeks and nubile waist,"
2599,II,"She passes, charmingly unchaste, illumining ignoble eyes. . . ."
2600,II,
2601,II,But now the blood from every heart leaps madder through abounding veins
2602,II,"As first the fascinating strains of ""El Irresistible"" start."
2603,II,
2604,II,"Caught in the spell of pulsing sound, impatient elbows lift and yield"
2605,II,"The scented softnesses they shield to arms that catch and close them round,"
2606,II,
2607,II,"Surrender, swift to be possessed, the silken supple forms beneath"
2608,II,To all the bliss the measures breathe and all the madness they suggest.
2609,II,
2610,II,Crowds congregate and make a ring.  Four deep they stand and strain to see
2611,II,The tango in its ecstasy of glowing lives that clasp and cling.
2612,II,
2613,II,"Lithe limbs relaxed, exalted eyes fastened on vacancy, they seem"
2614,II,"To float upon the perfumed stream of some voluptuous Paradise,"
2615,II,
2616,II,"Or, rapt in some Arabian Night, to rock there, cradled and subdued,"
2617,II,In a luxurious lassitude of rhythm and sensual delight.
2618,II,
2619,II,And only when the measures cease and terminate the flowing dance
2620,II,"They waken from their magic trance and join the cries that clamor ""Bis!"" . . ."
2621,II,
2622,II,"Midnight adjourns the festival.  The couples climb the crowded stair,"
2623,II,And out into the warm night air go singing fragments of the ball.
2624,II,
2625,II,"Close-folded in desire they pass, or stop to drink and talk awhile"
2626,II,In the cafes along the mile from Bullier's back to Montparnasse:
2627,II,
2628,II,"The ""Closerie"" or ""La Rotonde"", where smoking, under lamplit trees,"
2629,II,"Sit Art's enamored devotees, chatting across their 'brune' and 'blonde'. . . ."
2630,II,
2631,II,"Make one of them and come to know sweet Paris--not as many do,"
2632,II,"Seeing but the folly of the few, the froth, the tinsel, and the show --"
2633,II,
2634,II,But taking some white proffered hand that from Earth's barren every day
2635,II,Can lead you by the shortest way into Love's florid fairyland.
2636,II,
2637,II,And that divine enchanted life that lurks under Life's common guise --
2638,II,That city of romance that lies within the City's toil and strife --
2639,II,
2640,II,"Shall, knocking, open to your hands, for Love is all its golden key,"
2641,II,And one's name murmured tenderly the only magic it demands.
2642,II,
2643,II,"And when all else is gray and void in the vast gulf of memory,"
2644,II,Green islands of delight shall be all blessed moments so enjoyed:
2645,II,
2646,II,"When vaulted with the city skies, on its cathedral floors you stood,"
2647,II,"And, priest of a bright brotherhood, performed the mystic sacrifice,"
2648,II,
2649,II,"At Love's high altar fit to stand, with fire and incense aureoled,"
2650,II,The celebrant in cloth of gold with Spring and Youth on either hand.

2656,III,Choral Song
2657,III,
2658,III,
2659,III,Have ye gazed on its grandeur
2660,III,Or stood where it stands
2661,III,With opal and amber
2662,III,"Adorning the lands,"
2663,III,And orcharded domes
2664,III,Of the hue of all flowers?
2665,III,Sweet melody roams
2666,III,"Through its blossoming bowers,"
2667,III,Sweet bells usher in from its belfries the train of the honey-sweet hour.
2668,III,
2669,III,"A city resplendent,"
2670,III,"Fulfilled of good things,"
2671,III,On its ramparts are pendent
2672,III,The bucklers of kings.
2673,III,Broad banners unfurled
2674,III,Are afloat in its air.
2675,III,The lords of the world
2676,III,Look for harborage there.
2677,III,"None finds save he comes as a bridegroom, having roses and vine in his hair."
2678,III,
2679,III,"'Tis the city of Lovers,"
2680,III,There many paths meet.
2681,III,"Blessed he above others,"
2682,III,"With faltering feet,"
2683,III,Who past its proud spires
2684,III,Intends not nor hears
2685,III,The noise of its lyres
2686,III,Grow faint in his ears!
2687,III,"Men reach it through portals of triumph, but leave through a postern of tears."
2688,III,
2689,III,"It was thither, ambitious,"
2690,III,"We came for Youth's right,"
2691,III,When our lips yearned for kisses
2692,III,"As moths for the light,"
2693,III,When our souls cried for Love
2694,III,As for life-giving rain
2695,III,"Wan leaves of the grove,"
2696,III,"Withered grass of the plain,"
2697,III,"And our flesh ached for Love-flesh beside it with bitter, intolerable pain."
2698,III,
2699,III,"Under arbor and trellis,"
2700,III,"Full of flutes, full of flowers,"
2701,III,"What mad fortunes befell us,"
2702,III,What glad orgies were ours!
2703,III,"In the days of our youth,"
2704,III,"In our festal attire,"
2705,III,"When the sweet flesh was smooth,"
2706,III,"When the swift blood was fire,"
2707,III,And all Earth paid in orange and purple to pavilion the bed of Desire!
2708,III,

2710,III,
2711,III,
2712,III,The Sultan's Palace
2713,III,
2714,III,
2715,III,"My spirit only lived to look on Beauty's face,"
2716,III,As only when they clasp the arms seem served aright;
2717,III,"As in their flesh inheres the impulse to embrace,"
2718,III,To gaze on Loveliness was my soul's appetite.
2719,III,
2720,III,I have roamed far in search; white road and plunging bow
2721,III,Were keys in the blue doors where my desire was set;
2722,III,"Obedient to their lure, my lips and laughing brow"
2723,III,The hill-showers and the spray of many seas have wet.
2724,III,
2725,III,"Hot are enamored hands, the fragrant zone unbound,"
2726,III,"To leave no dear delight unfelt, unfondled o'er,"
2727,III,The will possessed my heart to girdle Earth around
2728,III,With their insatiate need to wonder and adore.
2729,III,
2730,III,"The flowers in the fields, the surf upon the sands,"
2731,III,"The sunset and the clouds it turned to blood and wine,"
2732,III,Were shreds of the thin veil behind whose beaded strands
2733,III,"A radiant visage rose, serene, august, divine."
2734,III,
2735,III,"A noise of summer wind astir in starlit trees,"
2736,III,"A song where sensual love's delirium rose and fell,"
2737,III,Were rites that moved my soul more than the devotee's
2738,III,When from the blazing choir rings out the altar bell.
2739,III,
2740,III,I woke amid the pomp of a proud palace; writ
2741,III,"In tinted arabesque on walls that gems o'erlay,"
2742,III,"The names of caliphs were who once held court in it,"
2743,III,Their baths and bowers were mine to dwell in for a day.
2744,III,
2745,III,Their robes and rings were mine to draw from shimmering trays --
2746,III,"Brocades and broidered silks, topaz and tourmaline --"
2747,III,"Their turban-cloths to wind in proud capricious ways,"
2748,III,And fasten plumes and pearls and pendent sapphires in.
2749,III,
2750,III,I rose; far music drew my steps in fond pursuit
2751,III,Down tessellated floors and towering peristyles:
2752,III,"Through groves of colonnades fair lamps were blushing fruit,"
2753,III,On seas of green mosaic soft rugs were flowery isles.
2754,III,
2755,III,"And there were verdurous courts that scalloped arches wreathed,"
2756,III,Where fountains plashed in bowls of lapis lazuli.
2757,III,"Through enigmatic doors voluptuous accents breathed,"
2758,III,And having Youth I had their Open Sesame.
2759,III,
2760,III,"I paused where shadowy walls were hung with cloths of gold,"
2761,III,And tinted twilight streamed through storied panes above.
2762,III,In lamplit alcoves deep as flowers when they unfold
2763,III,Soft cushions called to rest and fragrant fumes to love.
2764,III,
2765,III,I hungered; at my hand delicious dainties teemed --
2766,III,Fair pyramids of fruit; pastry in sugared piles.
2767,III,I thirsted; in cool cups inviting vintage beamed --
2768,III,Sweet syrups from the South; brown muscat from the isles.
2769,III,
2770,III,I yearned for passionate Love; faint gauzes fell away.
2771,III,Pillowed in rosy light I found my heart's desire.
2772,III,"Over the silks and down her florid beauty lay,"
2773,III,As over orient clouds the sunset's coral fire.
2774,III,
2775,III,"Joys that had smiled afar, a visionary form,"
2776,III,"Behind the ranges hid, remote and rainbow-dyed,"
2777,III,"Drew near unto my heart, a wonder soft and warm,"
2778,III,"To touch, to stroke, to clasp, to sleep and wake beside."
2779,III,
2780,III,"Joy, that where summer seas and hot horizons shone"
2781,III,"Had been the outspread arms I gave my youth to seek,"
2782,III,"Drew near; awhile its pulse strove sweetly with my own,"
2783,III,Awhile I felt its breath astir upon my cheek.
2784,III,
2785,III,"I was so happy there; so fleeting was my stay, --"
2786,III,"What wonder if, assailed with vistas so divine,"
2787,III,I only lived to search and sample them the day
2788,III,When between dawn and dusk the sultan's courts were mine!
2789,III,
2790,III,"Speak not of other worlds of happiness to be,"
2791,III,As though in any fond imaginary sphere
2792,III,Lay more to tempt man's soul to immortality
2793,III,Than ripens for his bliss abundant now and here!
2794,III,
2795,III,Flowerlike I hope to die as flowerlike was my birth.
2796,III,"Rooted in Nature's just benignant law like them,"
2797,III,I want no better joys than those that from green Earth
2798,III,My spirit's blossom drew through the sweet body's stem.
2799,III,
2800,III,"I see no dread in death, no horror to abhor."
2801,III,I never thought it else than but to cease to dwell
2802,III,"Spectator, and resolve most naturally once more"
2803,III,Into the dearly loved eternal spectacle.
2804,III,
2805,III,Unto the fields and flowers this flesh I found so fair
2806,III,"I yield; do you, dear friend, over your rose-crowned wine,"
2807,III,"Murmur my name some day as though my lips were there,"
2808,III,And frame your mouth as though its blushing kiss were mine.
2809,III,
2810,III,"Yea, where the banquet-hall is brilliant with young men,"
2811,III,"You whose bright youth it might have thrilled my breast to know,"
2812,III,"Drink . . . and perhaps my lips, insatiate even then"
2813,III,"Of lips to hang upon, may find their loved ones so."
2814,III,
2815,III,Unto the flush of dawn and evening I commend
2816,III,"This immaterial self and flamelike part of me, --"
2817,III,"Unto the azure haze that hangs at the world's end,"
2818,III,"The sunshine on the hills, the starlight on the sea, --"
2819,III,
2820,III,"Unto angelic Earth, whereof the lives of those"
2821,III,Who love and dream great dreams and deeply feel may be
2822,III,The elemental cells and nervules that compose
2823,III,Its divine consciousness and joy and harmony.

2828,III,Fragments
2829,III,
2830,III,
2831,I,I
2832,I,
2833,I,"In that fair capital where Pleasure, crowned"
2834,I,"Amidst her myriad courtiers, riots and rules,"
2835,I,I too have been a suitor.  Radiant eyes
2836,I,"Were my life's warmth and sunshine, outspread arms"
2837,I,My gilded deep horizons.  I rejoiced
2838,I,In yielding to all amorous influence
2839,I,"And multiple impulsion of the flesh,"
2840,I,To feel within my being surge and sway
2841,I,The force that all the stars acknowledge too.
2842,I,Amid the nebulous humanity
2843,I,"Where I an atom crawled and cleaved and sundered,"
2844,I,"I saw a million motions, but one law;"
2845,I,And from the city's splendor to my eyes
2846,I,"The vapors passed and there was nought but Love,"
2847,I,"A ferment turbulent, intensely fair,"
2848,I,Where Beauty beckoned and where Strength pursued.
2849,I,
2850,I,
2851,II,II
2852,II,
2853,II,"There was a time when I thought much of Fame,"
2854,II,And laid the golden edifice to be
2855,II,That in the clear light of eternity
2856,II,Should fitly house the glory of my name.
2857,II,
2858,II,"But swifter than my fingers pushed their plan,"
2859,II,"Over the fair foundation scarce begun,"
2860,II,"While I with lovers dallied in the sun,"
2861,II,The ivy clambered and the rose-vine ran.
2862,II,
2863,II,"And now, too late to see my vision, rise,"
2864,II,"In place of golden pinnacles and towers,"
2865,II,"Only some sunny mounds of leaves and flowers,"
2866,II,Only beloved of birds and butterflies.
2867,II,
2868,II,"My friends were duped, my favorers deceived;"
2869,II,"But sometimes, musing sorrowfully there,"
2870,II,That flowered wreck has seemed to me so fair
2871,II,I scarce regret the temple unachieved.
2872,II,
2873,II,
2874,III,III
2875,III,
2876,III,For there were nights . . . my love to him whose brow
2877,III,"Has glistened with the spoils of nights like those,"
2878,III,"Home turning as a conqueror turns home,"
2879,III,What time green dawn down every street uprears
2880,III,Arches of triumph!  He has drained as well
2881,III,Joy's perfumed bowl and cried as I have cried:
2882,III,Be Fame their mistress whom Love passes by.
2883,III,"This only matters:  from some flowery bed,"
2884,III,"Laden with sweetness like a homing bee,"
2885,III,"If one have known what bliss it is to come,"
2886,III,Bearing on hands and breast and laughing lips
2887,III,The fragrance of his youth's dear rose.  To him
2888,III,"The hills have bared their treasure, the far clouds"
2889,III,Unveiled the vision that o'er summer seas
2890,III,"Drew on his thirsting arms.  This last thing known,"
2891,III,"He can court danger, laugh at perilous odds,"
2892,III,"And, pillowed on a memory so sweet,"
2893,III,Unto oblivious eternity
2894,III,"Without regret yield his victorious soul,"
2895,III,The blessed pilgrim of a vow fulfilled.
2896,III,
2897,III,
2898,IV,IV
2899,IV,
2900,IV,What is Success?  Out of the endless ore
2901,IV,Of deep desire to coin the utmost gold
2902,IV,Of passionate memory; to have lived so well
2903,IV,"That the fifth moon, when it swims up once more"
2904,IV,Through orchard boughs where mating orioles build
2905,IV,"And apple flowers unfold,"
2906,IV,Find not of that dear need that all things tell
2907,IV,The heart unburdened nor the arms unfilled.
2908,IV,
2909,IV,"O Love, whereof my boyhood was the dream,"
2910,IV,"My youth the beautiful novitiate,"
2911,IV,"Life was so slight a thing and thou so great,"
2912,IV,How could I make thee less than all-supreme!
2913,IV,In thy sweet transports not alone I thought
2914,IV,Mingled the twain that panted breast to breast.
2915,IV,The sun and stars throbbed with them; they were caught
2916,IV,Into the pulse of Nature and possessed
2917,IV,By the same light that consecrates it so.
2918,IV,Love!--'tis the payment of the debt we owe
2919,IV,"The beauty of the world, and whensoe'er"
2920,IV,In silks and perfume and unloosened hair
2921,IV,"The loveliness of lovers, face to face,"
2922,IV,"Lies folded in the adorable embrace,"
2923,IV,Doubt not as of a perfect sacrifice
2924,IV,That soul partakes whose inspiration fills
2925,IV,"The springtime and the depth of summer skies,"
2926,IV,"The rainbow and the clouds behind the hills,"
2927,IV,That excellence in earth and air and sea
2928,IV,That makes things as they are the real divinity.
2929,IV,

2931,IV,
2932,IV,
2933,IV,Thirty Sonnets:
2934,IV,
2935,IV,
2936,IV,
2937,IV,
2938,IV,Sonnet I
2939,IV,
2940,IV,
2941,IV,Down the strait vistas where a city street
2942,IV,"Fades in pale dust and vaporous distances,"
2943,IV,Stained with far fumes the light grows less and less
2944,IV,And the sky reddens round the day's retreat.
2945,IV,"Now out of orient chambers, cool and sweet,"
2946,IV,"Like Nature's pure lustration, Dusk comes down."
2947,IV,Now the lamps brighten and the quickening town
2948,IV,Rings with the trample of returning feet.
2949,IV,"And Pleasure, risen from her own warm mould"
2950,IV,Sunk all the drowsy and unloved daylight
2951,IV,"In layers of odorous softness, Paphian girls"
2952,IV,"Cover with gauze, with satin, and with pearls,"
2953,IV,"Crown, and about her spangly vestments fold"
2954,IV,The ermine of the empire of the Night.
2955,IV,
2956,IV,
2957,IV,
2958,IV,
2959,IV,Sonnet II
2960,IV,
2961,IV,
2962,IV,"Her courts are by the flux of flaming ways,"
2963,IV,Between the rivers and the illumined sky
2964,IV,Whose fervid depths reverberate from on high
2965,IV,Fierce lustres mingled in a fiery haze.
2966,IV,They mark it inland; blithe and fair of face
2967,IV,"Her suitors follow, guessing by the glare"
2968,IV,Beyond the hilltops in the evening air
2969,IV,How bright the cressets at her portals blaze.
2970,IV,On the pure fronts Defeat ere many a day
2971,IV,Falls like the soot and dirt on city-snow;
2972,IV,There hopes deferred lie sunk in piteous seams.
2973,IV,"Her paths are disillusion and decay,"
2974,IV,"With ruins piled and unapparent woe,"
2975,IV,The graves of Beauty and the wreck of dreams.
2976,IV,
2977,IV,
2978,IV,
2979,IV,
2980,IV,Sonnet III
2981,IV,
2982,IV,
2983,IV,There was a youth around whose early way
2984,IV,"White angels hung in converse and sweet choir,"
2985,IV,"Teaching in summer clouds his thought to stray, --"
2986,IV,In cloud and far horizon to desire.
2987,IV,"His life was nursed in beauty, like the stream"
2988,IV,"Born of clear showers and the mountain dew,"
2989,IV,Close under snow-clad summits where they gleam
2990,IV,Forever pure against heaven's orient blue.
2991,IV,Within the city's shades he walked at last.
2992,IV,Faint and more faint in sad recessional
2993,IV,"Down the dim corridors of Time outworn,"
2994,IV,"A chorus ebbed from that forsaken past,"
2995,IV,A hymn of glories fled beyond recall
2996,IV,With the lost heights and splendor of life's morn.
2997,IV,
2998,IV,
2999,IV,
3000,IV,
3001,IV,Sonnet IV
3002,IV,
3003,IV,
3004,IV,Up at his attic sill the South wind came
3005,IV,And days of sun and storm but never peace.
3006,IV,Along the town's tumultuous arteries
3007,IV,He heard the heart-throbs of a sentient frame:
3008,IV,"Each night the whistles in the bay, the same"
3009,IV,Whirl of incessant wheels and clanging cars:
3010,IV,"For smoke that half obscured, the circling stars"
3011,IV,Burnt like his youth with but a sickly flame.
3012,IV,Up to his attic came the city cries --
3013,IV,The throes with which her iron sinews heave --
3014,IV,And yet forever behind prison doors
3015,IV,Welled in his heart and trembled in his eyes
3016,IV,The light that hangs on desert hills at eve
3017,IV,And tints the sea on solitary shores. . . .
3018,IV,
3019,IV,
3020,IV,
3021,IV,
3022,IV,Sonnet V
3023,IV,
3024,IV,
3025,IV,A tide of beauty with returning May
3026,IV,Floods the fair city; from warm pavements fume
3027,IV,Odors endeared; down avenues in bloom
3028,IV,The chestnut-trees with phallic spires are gay.
3029,IV,Over the terrace flows the thronged cafe;
3030,IV,The boulevards are streams of hurrying sound;
3031,IV,"And through the streets, like veins when they abound,"
3032,IV,The lust for pleasure throbs itself away.
3033,IV,"Here let me live, here let me still pursue"
3034,IV,"Phantoms of bliss that beckon and recede, --"
3035,IV,"Thy strange allurements, City that I love,"
3036,IV,"Maze of romance, where I have followed too"
3037,IV,The dream Youth treasures of its dearest need
3038,IV,And stars beyond thy towers bring tidings of.
3039,IV,
3040,IV,
3041,IV,
3042,IV,
3043,IV,Sonnet VI
3044,IV,
3045,IV,
3046,IV,"Give me the treble of thy horns and hoofs,"
3047,IV,"The ponderous undertones of 'bus and tram,"
3048,IV,A garret and a glimpse across the roofs
3049,IV,"Of clouds blown eastward over Notre Dame,"
3050,IV,The glad-eyed streets and radiant gatherings
3051,IV,"Where I drank deep the bliss of being young,"
3052,IV,The strife and sweet potential flux of things
3053,IV,I sought Youth's dream of happiness among!
3054,IV,"It walks here aureoled with the city-light,"
3055,IV,Forever through the myriad-featured mass
3056,IV,"Flaunting not far its fugitive embrace, --"
3057,IV,"Heard sometimes in a song across the night,"
3058,IV,"Caught in a perfume from the crowds that pass,"
3059,IV,And when love yields to love seen face to face.
3060,IV,
3061,IV,
3062,IV,
3063,IV,
3064,IV,Sonnet VII
3065,IV,
3066,IV,
3067,IV,"To me, a pilgrim on that journey bound"
3068,IV,"Whose stations Beauty's bright examples are,"
3069,IV,As of a silken city famed afar
3070,IV,"Over the sands for wealth and holy ground,"
3071,IV,Came the report of one--a woman crowned
3072,IV,"With all perfection, blemishless and high,"
3073,IV,"As the full moon amid the moonlit sky,"
3074,IV,With the world's praise and wonder clad around.
3075,IV,And I who held this notion of success:
3076,IV,To leave no form of Nature's loveliness
3077,IV,"Unworshipped, if glad eyes have access there, --"
3078,IV,Beyond all earthly bounds have made my goal
3079,IV,To find where that sweet shrine is and extol
3080,IV,The hand that triumphed in a work so fair.
3081,IV,
3082,IV,
3083,IV,
3084,IV,
3085,IV,Sonnet VIII
3086,IV,
3087,IV,
3088,IV,"Oft as by chance, a little while apart"
3089,IV,"The pall of empty, loveless hours withdrawn,"
3090,IV,"Sweet Beauty, opening on the impoverished heart,"
3091,IV,Beams like the jewel on the breast of dawn:
3092,IV,Not though high heaven should rend would deeper awe
3093,IV,"Fill me than penetrates my spirit thus,"
3094,IV,Nor all those signs the Patmian prophet saw
3095,IV,Seem a new heaven and earth so marvelous;
3096,IV,"But, clad thenceforth in iridescent dyes,"
3097,IV,"The fair world glistens, and in after days"
3098,IV,The memory of kind lips and laughing eyes
3099,IV,"Lives in my step and lightens all my face, --"
3100,IV,So they who found the Earthly Paradise
3101,IV,"Still breathed, returned, of that sweet, joyful place."
3102,IV,
3103,IV,
3104,IV,
3105,IV,
3106,IV,Sonnet IX
3107,IV,
3108,IV,
3109,IV,Amid the florid multitude her face
3110,IV,Was like the full moon seen behind the lace
3111,IV,Of orchard boughs where clouded blossoms part
3112,IV,When Spring shines in the world and in the heart.
3113,IV,As the full-moon-beams to the ferny floor
3114,IV,"Of summer woods through flower and foliage pour,"
3115,IV,So to my being's innermost recess
3116,IV,Flooded the light of so much loveliness;
3117,IV,She held as in a vase of priceless ware
3118,IV,The wine that over arid ways and bare
3119,IV,"My youth was the pathetic thirsting for,"
3120,IV,And where she moved the veil of Nature grew
3121,IV,Diaphanous and that radiance mantled through
3122,IV,"Which, when I see, I tremble and adore."
3123,IV,
3124,IV,
3125,IV,
3126,IV,
3127,IV,Sonnet X
3128,IV,
3129,IV,
3130,IV,"A splendor, flamelike, born to be pursued,"
3131,IV,With palms extent for amorous charity
3132,IV,"And eyes incensed with love for all they see,"
3133,IV,"A wonder more to be adored than wooed,"
3134,IV,On whom the grace of conscious womanhood
3135,IV,Adorning every little thing she does
3136,IV,"Sits like enchantment, making glorious"
3137,IV,"A careless pose, a casual attitude;"
3138,IV,Around her lovely shoulders mantle-wise
3139,IV,Hath come the realm of those old fabulous queens
3140,IV,"Whose storied loves are Art's rich heritage,"
3141,IV,To keep alive in this our latter age
3142,IV,That force that moving through sweet Beauty's means
3143,IV,Lifts up Man's soul to towering enterprise.
3144,IV,
3145,IV,
3146,IV,
3147,IV,
3148,IV,Sonnet XI
3149,IV,
3150,IV,"* A paraphrase of Petrarca, 'Quando fra l'altre donne . . .'"
3151,IV,
3152,IV,
3153,IV,When among creatures fair of countenance
3154,IV,"Love comes enformed in such proud character,"
3155,IV,"So far as other beauty yields to her,"
3156,IV,So far the breast with fiercer longing pants;
3157,IV,"I bless the spot, and hour, and circumstance,"
3158,IV,"That wed desire to a thing so high,"
3159,IV,"And say, Glad soul, rejoice, for thou and I"
3160,IV,Of bliss unpaired are made participants;
3161,IV,Hence have come ardent thoughts and waking dreams
3162,IV,"That, feeding Fancy from so sweet a cup,"
3163,IV,Leave it no lust for gross imaginings.
3164,IV,Through her the woman's perfect beauty gleams
3165,IV,That while it gazes lifts the spirit up
3166,IV,To that high source from which all beauty springs.
3167,IV,
3168,IV,
3169,IV,
3170,IV,
3171,IV,Sonnet XII
3172,IV,
3173,IV,
3174,IV,"Like as a dryad, from her native bole"
3175,IV,"Coming at dusk, when the dim stars emerge,"
3176,IV,To a slow river at whose silent verge
3177,IV,"Tall poplars tremble and deep grasses roll,"
3178,IV,"Come thou no less and, kneeling in a shoal"
3179,IV,"Of the freaked flag and meadow buttercup,"
3180,IV,Bend till thine image from the pool beam up
3181,IV,Arched with blue heaven like an aureole.
3182,IV,See how adorable in fancy then
3183,IV,"Lives the fair face it mirrors even so,"
3184,IV,O thou whose beauty moving among men
3185,IV,"Is like the wind's way on the woods below,"
3186,IV,Filling all nature where its pathway lies
3187,IV,With arms that supplicate and trembling sighs.
3188,IV,

3190,IV,
3191,IV,
3192,IV,Sonnet XIII
3193,IV,
3194,IV,
3195,IV,"I fancied, while you stood conversing there,"
3196,IV,"Superb, in every attitude a queen,"
3197,IV,"Her ermine thus Boadicea bare,"
3198,IV,So moved amid the multitude Faustine.
3199,IV,"My life, whose whole religion Beauty is,"
3200,IV,Be charged with sin if ever before yours
3201,IV,A lesser feeling crossed my mind than his
3202,IV,Who owning grandeur marvels and adores.
3203,IV,"Nay, rather in my dream-world's ivory tower"
3204,IV,"I made your image the high pearly sill,"
3205,IV,"And mounting there in many a wistful hour,"
3206,IV,"Burdened with love, I trembled and was still,"
3207,IV,Seeing discovered from that azure height
3208,IV,"Remote, untrod horizons of delight."
3209,IV,
3210,IV,
3211,IV,
3212,IV,
3213,IV,Sonnet XIV
3214,IV,
3215,IV,
3216,IV,It may be for the world of weeds and tares
3217,IV,And dearth in Nature of sweet Beauty's rose
3218,IV,That oft as Fortune from ten thousand shows
3219,IV,One from the train of Love's true courtiers
3220,IV,"Straightway on him who gazes, unawares,"
3221,IV,"Deep wonder seizes and swift trembling grows,"
3222,IV,"Reft by that sight of purpose and repose,"
3223,IV,Hardly its weight his fainting breast upbears.
3224,IV,Then on the soul from some ancestral place
3225,IV,"Floods back remembrance of its heavenly birth,"
3226,IV,"When, in the light of that serener sphere,"
3227,IV,It saw ideal beauty face to face
3228,IV,That through the forms of this our meaner Earth
3229,IV,Shines with a beam less steadfast and less clear.

3239,IV,"Whose hands, when men had craved substantial food,"
3240,IV,"Gave not, nor folded when they cried, Embrace,"
3241,IV,I saw exalted in the latter days
3242,IV,"Her whom west winds with natal foam bedewed,"
3243,IV,"Wafted toward Cyprus, lily-breasted, nude,"
3244,IV,Standing with arms out-stretched and flower-like face.
3245,IV,"And, sick with all those centuries of tears"
3246,IV,"Shed in the penance for factitious woe,"
3247,IV,"Once more I saw the nations at her feet,"
3248,IV,"For Love shone in their eyes, and in their ears"

3260,IV,On some green headland fronting to the East
3261,IV,Our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day.
3262,IV,"Naked, uplifting in a laden tray"
3263,IV,"New milk and honey and sweet-tinctured wine,"
3264,IV,Not without twigs of clustering apple-spray
3265,IV,To wreath a garland for Our Lady's shrine.
3266,IV,The morning planet poised above the sea
3267,IV,Shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid;
3268,IV,"Dew-drenched, his delicate virginity"

3283,IV,Watching blue ocean where the white sails steer
3284,IV,Fruit-laden forth or with the wares and news
3285,IV,"Of merchant cities seek our harbors here,"
3286,IV,"Careless how Corinth fares, how Syracuse;"

3324,IV,"Her robes were gauzes--gold and green and gules,"
3325,IV,"All furry things flocked round her, from her hand"
3326,IV,Nibbling their foods and fawning at her feet.
3327,IV,Two peacocks watched her where she made her seat
3328,IV,Beside a fountain in Broceliande.
3329,IV,Sometimes she sang. . . .  Whoever heard forgot
3330,IV,"Errand and aim, and knights at noontide here,"
3331,IV,"Riding from fabulous gestes beyond the seas,"
3332,IV,"Would follow, tranced, and seek . . . and find her not . . ."

3343,IV,That eddy through their incandescent nights.
3344,IV,I loved remote horizons with far clouds
3345,IV,"Girdled, and fringed about with snowy heights."
3346,IV,"I loved fair women, their sweet, conscious ways"
3347,IV,Of wearing among hands that covet and plead
3348,IV,The rose ablossom at the rainbow's base
3349,IV,That bounds the world's desire and all its need.
3350,IV,"Nature I worshipped, whose fecundity"
3351,IV,"Embraces every vision the most fair,"
3352,IV,Of perfect benediction.  From a boy
3353,IV,I gloated on existence.  Earth to me

3367,IV,"But sometime on an afternoon in spring,"
3368,IV,"When dandelions dot the fields with gold,"
3369,IV,And under rustling shade a few weeks old
3370,IV,"'Tis sweet to stroll and hear the bluebirds sing,"
3371,IV,"Do you, blond head, whom beauty and the power"
3372,IV,Of being young and winsome have prepared
3373,IV,"For life's last privilege that really pays,"
3374,IV,Make the companion of an idle hour

3391,IV,Through thee achieved the love that Shakespeare knew.

3409,IV,Lie near me in dim forests where the croon
3410,IV,"Of wood-doves sounds and moss-banked water flows,"
3411,IV,Or musing late till the midsummer moon
3412,IV,Breaks through some ruined abbey's empty rose.
3413,IV,Sweetest of those to-day whose pious hands

3431,IV,"Cover, and tangled vines have overgrown"
3432,IV,The gate where banners blazoned with a cross
3433,IV,Rolled forth to toss round Tyre and Ascalon.

3595,IV,"Each tender charm intolerable to lose,"
3596,IV,Each happy scene his fancy recreates.

3612,IV,Even as by inches darkens all his joy.
3613,IV,"He dreams of the sweet night their lips first met,"

3630,IV,"He kneels and bows his head upon his breast,"
3631,IV,"And feigns a prayer to hide his burning tears,"
3632,IV,While the satanic voice reiterates

3696,II,Like a returning caravel caressed
3697,II,By breezes that load all the ambient airs
3698,II,With clinging fragrance of the bales it bears
3699,II,"From harbors where the caravans come down,"
3700,II,I see over the roof-tops of the town
3701,II,"The new moon back again, but shall not see"
3702,II,"The joy that once it had in store for me,"
3703,II,"Nor know again the voice upon the stair,"
3704,II,"The little studio in the candle-glare,"
3705,II,And all that makes in word and touch and glance
3706,II,The bliss of the first nights of a romance
3707,II,When will to love and be beloved casts out
3708,II,The want to question or the will to doubt.
3709,II,You loved me once. . . .  Under the western seas
3710,II,The pale moon settles and the Pleiades.

3728,III,That cost a lesser agony to lose.
3729,III,
3730,III,I had not bid for beautifuller hours
3731,III,"Had I not found the door so near unsealed,"
3732,III,"Nor hoped, had you not filled my arms with flowers,"
3733,III,For that one flower that bloomed too far afield.
3734,III,
3735,III,"If I have wept, it was because, forsaken,"
3736,III,I felt perhaps more poignantly than some
3737,III,The blank eternity from which we waken
3738,III,And all the blank eternity to come.
3739,III,
3740,III,And I betrayed how sweet a thing and tender
3741,III,(In the regret with which my lip was curled)
3742,III,"Seemed in its tragic, momentary splendor"
3743,III,My transit through the beauty of the world.

3753,III,"By the light veils they burned and blushed amid,"
3754,III,"Skilled to provoke in soft, lascivious ways,"
3755,III,And there was invitation in her voice
3756,III,"And laughing lips and wonderful dark eyes,"
3757,III,As though above the gates of Paradise
3758,III,"Fair verses bade, Be welcome and rejoice!"
3759,III,
3760,III,O'er rugs where mottled blue and green and red
3761,III,"Blent in the patterns of the Orient loom,"
3762,III,"Like a bright butterfly from bloom to bloom,"
3763,III,She floated with delicious arms outspread.
3764,III,"There was no pose she took, no move she made,"
3765,III,"But all the feverous, love-envenomed flesh"
3766,III,Wrapped round as in the gladiator's mesh
3767,III,And smote as with his triple-forked blade.
3768,III,
3769,III,I thought that round her sinuous beauty curled
3770,III,"Fierce exhalations of hot human love, --"
3771,III,Around her beauty valuable above
3772,III,The sunny outspread kingdoms of the world;
3773,III,Flowing as ever like a dancing fire
3774,III,"Flowed her belled ankles and bejewelled wrists,"
3775,III,Around her beauty swept like sanguine mists

3846,III,
3847,III,Came a term to that land's old favoredness:

3874,III,So bowed with years--when still he lingered on:

3878,III,"Where, on the wide world's uttermost extremes,"
3879,III,"Her amber-walled, auroral palace gleams,"
3880,III,High in an orient chamber bade prepare
3881,III,"An everlasting couch, and laid him there,"
3882,III,"And leaving, closed the shining doors.  But he,"
3883,III,"Deathless by Jove's compassionless decree,"
3884,III,"Found not, as others find, a dreamless rest."
3885,III,"There wakeful, with half-waking dreams oppressed,"
3886,III,"Still in an aural, visionary haze"
3887,III,Float round him vanished forms of happier days;
3888,III,Still at his side he fancies to behold
3889,III,"The rosy, radiant thing beloved of old;"
3890,III,"And oft, as over dewy meads at morn,"
3891,III,Far inland from a sunrise coast is borne
3892,III,"The drowsy, muffled moaning of the sea,"

3942,III,Above the currents that tarnish and profane

3974,III,The tropic sunset's bloom on cloudy piles
3975,III,Cast out industrious cares with dreams of fabulous isles --

3999,III,"In one long tension to hear, to see, to touch."
4000,III,Now on each rustling night-wind from the South
4001,III,Far music calls; beyond the harbor mouth
4002,III,Each outbound argosy with sail unfurled
4003,III,May point the path through this fortuitous world
4004,III,That holds the heart from its desire.  Away!

4087,III,"The spirits lie confined.""  Whom answering,"
4088,III,"""Master,"" I said, ""thy words assurance bring"

4090,III,And I was fain to ask who lies enclosed
4091,III,"In the embrace of that dividing fire,"
4092,III,"Which seems to curl above the fabled pyre,"
4093,III,"Where with his twin-born brother, fiercely hated,"
4094,III,"Eteocles was laid.""  He answered, ""Mated"
4095,III,"In punishment as once in wrath they were,"
4096,III,Ulysses there and Diomed incur
4097,III,The eternal pains; there groaning they deplore
4098,III,"The ambush of the horse, which made the door"

4115,III,
4116,III,So when the flame had come where time and place
4117,III,Seemed not unfitting to my guide with grace
4118,III,"To question, thus he spoke at my desire:"

4121,III,"Merit, or more or less--for tribute done"

4142,III,I launched once more upon the open main.
4143,III,"Both shores I visited as far as Spain, --"
4144,III,"Sardinia, and Morocco, and what more"
4145,III,The midland sea upon its bosom wore.
4146,III,The hour of our lives was growing late
4147,III,When we arrived before that narrow strait
4148,III,Where Hercules had set his bounds to show
4149,III,"That there Man's foot shall pause, and further none shall go."
4150,III,"Borne with the gale past Seville on the right,"
4151,III,"And on the left now swept by Ceuta's site,"
4152,III,"'Brothers,' I cried, 'that into the far West"
4153,III,"Through perils numberless are now addressed,"
4154,III,In this brief respite that our mortal sense
4155,III,"Yet hath, shrink not from new experience;"
4156,III,"But sailing still against the setting sun,"
4157,III,Seek we new worlds where Man has never won
4158,III,Before us.  Ponder your proud destinies:
4159,III,"Born were ye not like brutes for swinish ease,"
4160,III,But virtue and high knowledge to pursue.'
4161,III,My comrades with such zeal did I imbue
4162,III,"By these brief words, that scarcely could I then"
4163,III,Have turned them from their purpose; so again
4164,III,"We set out poop against the morning sky,"
4165,III,And made our oars as wings wherewith to fly
4166,III,Into the Unknown.  And ever from the right
4167,III,"Our course deflecting, in the balmy night"
4168,III,"All southern stars we saw, and ours so low,"
4169,III,That scarce above the sea-marge it might show.
4170,III,"So five revolving periods the soft,"
4171,III,"Pale light had robbed of Cynthia, and as oft"
4172,III,"Replenished since our start, when far and dim"
4173,III,"Over the misty ocean's utmost rim,"
4174,III,"Rose a great mountain, that for very height"
4175,III,Passed any I had seen.  Boundless delight
4176,III,"Filled us--alas, and quickly turned to dole:"
4177,III,"For, springing from our scarce-discovered goal,"
4178,III,A whirlwind struck the ship; in circles three
4179,III,It whirled us helpless in the eddying sea;
4180,III,"High on the fourth the fragile stern uprose,"
4181,III,"The bow drove down, and, as Another chose,"
4182,III,"Over our heads we heard the surging billows close."""

4212,III,"A savage people, cruel and untamed,"
4213,III,Brought the rich prize of many a hateful war.

4226,III,Could turn that people from their harsh intent.
4227,III,"Alas, what temper is conceived so ill"
4228,III,"But, Pity moving not, Love's soft enthralment will?"
4229,III,
4230,III,On the cold granite at the ocean's rim
4231,III,These folk had chained her fast and gone their way;
4232,III,Fresh in the softness of each delicate limb
4233,III,The pity of their bruising violence lay.
4234,III,"Over her beauty, from the eye of day"
4235,III,"To hide its pleading charms, no veil was thrown."
4236,III,Only the fragments of the salt sea-spray
4237,III,"Rose from the churning of the waves, wind-blown,"

4240,III,"Carved out of candid marble without flaw,"
4241,III,"Or alabaster blemishless and rare,"
4242,III,"Ruggiero might have fancied what he saw,"
4243,III,"For statue-like it seemed, and fastened there"
4244,III,By craft of cunningest artificer;
4245,III,Save in the wistful eyes Ruggiero thought
4246,III,"A teardrop gleamed, and with the rippling hair"
4247,III,The ocean breezes played as if they sought
4248,III,In its loose depths to hide that which her hand might not.

4250,III,Pity and wonder and awakening love
4251,III,Strove in the bosom of the Moorish Knight.
4252,III,Down from his soaring in the skies above
4253,III,He urged the tenor of his courser's flight.
4254,III,Fairer with every foot of lessening height
4255,III,Shone the sweet prisoner.  With tightening reins
4256,III,"He drew more nigh, and gently as he might:"
4257,III,"""O lady, worthy only of the chains"
4258,III,"With which his bounden slaves the God of Love constrains,"
4259,III,
4260,III,"""And least for this or any ill designed,"
4261,III,"Oh, what unnatural and perverted race"
4262,III,"Could the sweet flesh with flushing stricture bind,"
4263,III,And leave to suffer in this cold embrace
4264,III,"That the warm arms so hunger to replace?"""
4265,III,Into the damsel's cheeks such color flew
4266,III,As by the alchemy of ancient days
4267,III,If whitest ivory should take the hue
4268,III,Of coral where it blooms deep in the liquid blue.
4269,III,
4270,III,Nor yet so tightly drawn the cruel chains
4271,III,"Clasped the slim ankles and the wounded hands,"
4272,III,"But with soft, cringing attitudes in vain"
4273,III,She strove to shield her from that ardent glance.
4274,III,"So, clinging to the walls of some old manse,"
4275,III,"The rose-vine strives to shield her tender flowers,"
4276,III,"When the rude wind, as autumn weeks advance,"
4277,III,Beats on the walls and whirls about the towers
4278,III,And spills at every blast her pride in piteous showers.
4279,III,
4280,III,"And first for choking sobs she might not speak,"
4281,III,"And then, ""Alas!"" she cried, ""ah, woe is me!"""
4282,III,"And more had said in accents faint and weak,"
4283,III,Pleading for succor and sweet liberty.
4284,III,But hark! across the wide ways of the sea
4285,III,Rose of a sudden such a fierce affray
4286,III,That any but the brave had turned to flee.

4345,III,"Where the flood-tide of France's early gain,"
4346,III,"Big with wrecked promise and abandoned hopes,"
4347,III,Broke in a surf of blood along the Aisne.
4348,III,
4349,III,"The charge her heroes left us, we assumed,"
4350,III,"What, dying, they reconquered, we preserved,"
4351,III,"In the chill trenches, harried, shelled, entombed,"
4352,III,"Winter came down on us, but no man swerved."
4353,III,
4354,III,"Winter came down on us.  The low clouds, torn"
4355,III,"In the stark branches of the riven pines,"
4356,III,Blurred the white rockets that from dusk till morn
4357,III,Traced the wide curve of the close-grappling lines.
4358,III,
4359,III,"In rain, and fog that on the withered hill"
4360,III,"Froze before dawn, the lurking foe drew down;"
4361,III,Or light snows fell that made forlorner still
4362,III,The ravaged country and the ruined town;
4363,III,
4364,III,"Or the long clouds would end.  Intensely fair,"
4365,III,The winter constellations blazing forth --
4366,III,"Perseus, the Twins, Orion, the Great Bear --"
4367,III,Gleamed on our bayonets pointing to the north.
4368,III,
4369,III,And the lone sentinel would start and soar
4370,III,On wings of strong emotion as he knew
4371,III,That kinship with the stars that only War
4372,III,Is great enough to lift man's spirit to.
4373,III,
4374,III,"And ever down the curving front, aglow"
4375,III,"With the pale rockets' intermittent light,"
4376,III,"He heard, like distant thunder, growl and grow"
4377,III,"The rumble of far battles in the night, --"
4378,III,
4379,III,"Rumors, reverberant, indistinct, remote,"
4380,III,Borne from red fields whose martial names have won

4383,III,

4385,III,"Where like sere leaves lay strewn September's dead,"
4386,III,I found for all dear things I forfeited
4387,III,A recompense I would not now forego.
4388,III,
4389,III,For that high fellowship was ours then
4390,III,"With those who, championing another's good,"
4391,III,"More than dull Peace or its poor votaries could,"
4392,III,Taught us the dignity of being men.
4393,III,
4394,III,"There we drained deeper the deep cup of life,"
4395,III,"And on sublimer summits came to learn,"
4396,III,"After soft things, the terrible and stern,"
4397,III,"After sweet Love, the majesty of Strife;"
4398,III,
4399,III,There where we faced under those frowning heights
4400,III,"The blast that maims, the hurricane that kills;"
4401,III,There where the watchlights on the winter hills
4402,III,Flickered like balefire through inclement nights;
4403,III,
4404,III,"There where, firm links in the unyielding chain,"
4405,III,Where fell the long-planned blow and fell in vain --
4406,III,"Hearts worthy of the honor and the trial,"
4407,III,We helped to hold the lines along the Aisne.

4421,III,"The undisturbed, delightful paths of Earth,"

4424,III,
4425,III,"Here, by devoted comrades laid away,"

4427,III,Beside the crater at the Ferme d'Alger

4430,III,And round the city whose cathedral towers

4433,III,That clothe the sunny chalk-fields of Champagne.
4434,III,

4440,III,That other generations might possess --
4441,III,From shame and menace free in years to come --
4442,III,"A richer heritage of happiness,"
4443,III,He marched to that heroic martyrdom.
4444,III,
4445,III,Esteeming less the forfeit that he paid
4446,III,Than undishonored that his flag might float
4447,III,"Over the towers of liberty, he made"

4453,III,And Autumn yellow with maturing vines.
4454,III,
4455,III,There the grape-pickers at their harvesting
4456,III,"Shall lightly tread and load their wicker trays,"
4457,III,Blessing his memory as they toil and sing
4458,III,In the slant sunshine of October days. . . .
4459,III,
4460,III,I love to think that if my blood should be
4461,III,"So privileged to sink where his has sunk,"
4462,III,"I shall not pass from Earth entirely,"
4463,III,"But when the banquet rings, when healths are drunk,"
4464,III,
4465,III,And faces that the joys of living fill
4466,III,"Glow radiant with laughter and good cheer,"
4467,III,In beaming cups some spark of me shall still
4468,III,Brim toward the lips that once I held so dear.
4469,III,
4470,III,So shall one coveting no higher plane
4471,III,"Than nature clothes in color and flesh and tone,"
4472,III,Even from the grave put upward to attain
4473,III,The dreams youth cherished and missed and might have known;
4474,III,
4475,III,And that strong need that strove unsatisfied
4476,III,"Toward earthly beauty in all forms it wore,"
4477,III,Not death itself shall utterly divide
4478,III,From the beloved shapes it thirsted for.
4479,III,
4480,III,"Alas, how many an adept for whose arms"
4481,III,"Life held delicious offerings perished here,"
4482,III,"How many in the prime of all that charms,"
4483,III,Crowned with all gifts that conquer and endear!
4484,III,
4485,III,"Honor them not so much with tears and flowers,"
4486,III,"But you with whom the sweet fulfilment lies,"
4487,III,Where in the anguish of atrocious hours
4488,III,"Turned their last thoughts and closed their dying eyes,"
4489,III,
4490,III,Rather when music on bright gatherings lays
4491,III,"Its tender spell, and joy is uppermost,"
4492,III,"Be mindful of the men they were, and raise"
4493,III,Your glasses to them in one silent toast.
4494,III,
4495,III,"Drink to them--amorous of dear Earth as well,"
4496,III,They asked no tribute lovelier than this --

5059,II,From your imaginary height

5062,II,The neighbor at your southern gate

5096,II,And understand--what you are blind to --
5097,II,The things that the individual
5098,II,Must sacrifice for the good of all.
5099,II,
5100,II,You have a leader who knows--the man
5101,II,"Most fit to be called American,"
5102,II,A prophet that once in generations
5103,II,Is given to point to erring nations
5104,II,Brighter ideals toward which to press
5105,II,And lead them out of the wilderness.
5106,II,Will you turn your back on him once again?
5107,II,Will you give the tiller once more to men
5108,II,Who have made your country the laughing-stock
5109,II,"For the older peoples to scorn and mock,"
5110,II,"Who would make you servile, despised, and weak,"
5111,II,"A country that turns the other cheek,"
5112,II,"Who care not how bravely your flag may float,"
5113,II,"Who answer an insult with a note,"
5114,II,"Whose way is the easy way in all,"
5115,II,"And, seeing that polished arms appal"
5116,II,"Their marrow of milk-fed pacifist,"
5117,II,Would tell you menace does not exist?
5118,II,"Are these, in the world's great parliament,"
5119,II,The men you would choose to represent
5120,II,"Your honor, your manhood, and your pride,"
5121,II,And the virtues your fathers dignified?
5122,II,"Oh, bury them deeper than the sea"
5123,II,In universal obloquy;
5124,II,"Forget the ground where they lie, or write"
5125,II,"For epitaph:  ""Too proud to fight."""
5126,II,
5127,II,I have been too long from my country's shores
5128,II,"To reckon what state of mind is yours,"
5129,II,But as for myself I know right well
5130,II,I would go through fire and shot and shell
5131,II,And face new perils and make my bed
5132,II,"In new privations, if ROOSEVELT led;"
5133,II,But I have given my heart and hand
5134,II,"To serve, in serving another land,"
5135,II,Ideals kept bright that with you are dim;
5136,II,"Here men can thrill to their country's hymn,"
5137,II,For the passion that wells in the Marseillaise
5138,II,"Is the same that fires the French these days,"
5139,II,"And, when the flag that they love goes by,"
5140,II,With swelling bosom and moistened eye
5141,II,"They can look, for they know that it floats there still"
5142,II,"By the might of their hands and the strength of their will,"
5143,II,And through perils countless and trials unknown
5144,II,Its honor each man has made his own.
5145,II,"They wanted the war no more than you,"
5146,II,"But they saw how the certain menace grew,"
5147,II,And they gave two years of their youth or three
5148,II,The more to insure their liberty
5149,II,When the wrath of rifles and pennoned spears
5150,II,Should roll like a flood on their wrecked frontiers.
5151,II,"They wanted the war no more than you,"
5152,II,But when the dreadful summons blew
5153,II,And the time to settle the quarrel came
5154,II,"They sprang to their guns, each man was game;"
5155,II,And mark if they fight not to the last
5156,II,"For their hearths, their altars, and their past:"
5157,II,"Yea, fight till their veins have been bled dry"
5158,II,For love of the country that WILL not die.
5159,II,
5160,II,"O friends, in your fortunate present ease"
5161,II,"(Yet faced by the self-same facts as these),"
5162,II,If you would see how a race can soar
5163,II,"That has no love, but no fear, of war,"
5164,II,How each can turn from his private role
5165,II,"That all may act as a perfect whole,"
5166,II,How men can live up to the place they claim
5167,II,"And a nation, jealous of its good name,"
5168,II,"Be true to its proud inheritance,"
5169,II,"Oh, look over here and learn from FRANCE!"

5173,II,Introduction and Conclusion of a Long Poem
5174,II,
5175,II,
5176,II,I have gone sometimes by the gates of Death
5177,II,And stood beside the cavern through whose doors
5178,II,Enter the voyagers into the unseen.
5179,II,"From that dread threshold only, gazing back,"
5180,II,Have eyes in swift illumination seen
5181,II,"Life utterly revealed, and guessed therein"
5182,II,What things were vital and what things were vain.
5183,II,"Know then, like a vast ocean from my feet"
5184,II,"Spreading away into the morning sky,"
5185,II,"I saw unrolled my vanished days, and, lo,"
5186,II,Oblivion like a morning mist obscured
5187,II,"Toils, trials, ambitions, agitations, ease,"
5188,II,"And like green isles, sun-kissed, with sweet perfume"
5189,II,"Loading the airs blown back from that dim gulf,"
5190,II,Gleamed only through the all-involving haze
5191,II,The hours when we have loved and been beloved.
5192,II,
5193,II,"Therefore, sweet friends, as often as by Love"
5194,II,You rise absorbed into the harmony
5195,II,"Of planets singing round magnetic suns,"
5196,II,Let not propriety nor prejudice
5197,II,Nor the precepts of jealous age deny
5198,II,What Sense so incontestably affirms;
5199,II,Cling to the blessed moment and drink deep
5200,II,"Of the sweet cup it tends, as there alone"
5201,II,Were that which makes life worth the pain to live.
5202,II,What is so fair as lovers in their joy
5203,II,"That dies in sleep, their sleep that wakes in joy?"
5204,II,Caressing arms are their light pillows.  They
5205,II,That like lost stars have wandered hitherto
5206,II,"Lonesome and lightless through the universe,"
5207,II,Now glow transfired at Nature's flaming core;
5208,II,They are the centre; constellated heaven
5209,II,Is the embroidered panoply spread round
5210,II,"Their bridal, and the music of the spheres"
5211,II,Rocks them in hushed epithalamium.
5212,II,
5213,II,.    .    .    .    .
5214,II,
5215,II,I know that there are those whose idle tongues
5216,II,Blaspheme the beauty of the world that was
5217,II,So wondrous and so worshipful to me.
5218,II,"I call them those that, in the palace where"
5219,II,"Down perfumed halls the Sleeping Beauty lay,"
5220,II,Wandered without the secret or the key.
5221,II,"I know that there are those, of gentler heart,"
5222,II,"Broken by grief or by deception bowed,"
5223,II,Who in some realm beyond the grave conceive
5224,II,"The bliss they found not here; but, as for me,"
5225,II,In the soft fibres of the tender flesh
5226,II,I saw potentialities of Joy
5227,II,"Ten thousand lifetimes could not use.  Dear Earth,"
5228,II,In this dark month when deep as morning dew
5229,II,On thy maternal breast shall fall the blood
5230,II,"Of those that were thy loveliest and thy best,"
5231,II,"If it be fate that mine shall mix with theirs,"
5232,II,"Hear this my natural prayer, for, purified"
5233,II,By that Lethean agony and clad
5234,II,"In more resplendent powers, I ask nought else"
5235,II,"Than reincarnate to retrace my path,"
5236,II,"Be born again of woman, walk once more"
5237,II,"Through Childhood's fragrant, flowery wonderland"
5238,II,"And, entered in the golden realm of Youth,"
5239,II,Fare still a pilgrim toward the copious joys
5240,II,I savored here yet scarce began to sip;
5241,II,"Yea, with the comrades that I loved so well"
5242,II,Resume the banquet we had scarce begun
5243,II,When in the street we heard the clarion-call
5244,II,"And each man sprang to arms--ay, even myself"
5245,II,Who loved sweet Youth too truly not to share
5246,II,Its pain no less than its delight.  If prayers
5247,II,"Are to be prayed, lo, here is mine!  Be this"
5248,II,"My resurrection, this my recompense!"

5253,II,

5259,I,
5260,I,"Ay, it is fitting on this holiday,"
5261,I,"Commemorative of our soldier dead,"
5262,I,When--with sweet flowers of our New England May
5263,I,Hiding the lichened stones by fifty years made gray --
5264,I,"Their graves in every town are garlanded,"
5265,I,That pious tribute should be given too
5266,I,To our intrepid few
5267,I,Obscurely fallen here beyond the seas.
5268,I,Those to preserve their country's greatness died;
5269,I,But by the death of these
5270,I,Something that we can look upon with pride
5271,I,"Has been achieved, nor wholly unreplied"
5272,I,Can sneerers triumph in the charge they make
5273,I,That from a war where Freedom was at stake
5274,I,"America withheld and, daunted, stood aside."
5275,I,
5276,I,
5277,II,II
5278,II,
5279,II,"Be they remembered here with each reviving spring,"
5280,II,"Not only that in May, when life is loveliest,"
5281,II,Around Neuville-Saint-Vaast and the disputed crest
5282,II,"Of Vimy, they, superb, unfaltering,"
5283,II,"In that fine onslaught that no fire could halt,"
5284,II,Parted impetuous to their first assault;
5285,II,But that they brought fresh hearts and springlike too
5286,II,"To that high mission, and 'tis meet to strew"
5287,II,With twigs of lilac and spring's earliest rose
5288,II,The cenotaph of those
5289,II,Who in the cause that history most endears
5290,II,Fell in the sunny morn and flower of their young years.
5291,II,
5292,II,
5293,III,III
5294,III,
5295,III,"Yet sought they neither recompense nor praise,"
5296,III,Nor to be mentioned in another breath
5297,III,Than their blue coated comrades whose great days
5298,III,"It was their pride to share--ay, share even to the death!"
5299,III,"Nay, rather, France, to you they rendered thanks"
5300,III,"(Seeing they came for honor, not for gain),"
5301,III,"Who, opening to them your glorious ranks,"
5302,III,"Gave them that grand occasion to excel,"
5303,III,That chance to live the life most free from stain
5304,III,And that rare privilege of dying well.

5309,IV,O friends!  I know not since that war began
5310,IV,From which no people nobly stands aloof
5311,IV,If in all moments we have given proof
5312,IV,Of virtues that were thought American.
5313,IV,I know not if in all things done and said
5314,IV,"All has been well and good,"
5315,IV,Or if each one of us can hold his head
5316,IV,"As proudly as he should,"
5317,IV,"Or, from the pattern of those mighty dead"
5318,IV,"Whose shades our country venerates to-day,"
5319,IV,If we've not somewhat fallen and somewhat gone astray.
5320,IV,"But you to whom our land's good name is dear,"
5321,IV,If there be any here
5322,IV,"Who wonder if her manhood be decreased,"
5323,IV,Relaxed its sinews and its blood less red
5324,IV,"Than that at Shiloh and Antietam shed,"
5325,IV,"Be proud of these, have joy in this at least,"
5326,IV,"And cry:  ""Now heaven be praised"
5327,IV,"That in that hour that most imperilled her,"
5328,IV,Menaced her liberty who foremost raised
5329,IV,"Europe's bright flag of freedom, some there were"
5330,IV,"Who, not unmindful of the antique debt,"
5331,IV,Came back the generous path of Lafayette;
5332,IV,And when of a most formidable foe
5333,IV,"She checked each onset, arduous to stem --"
5334,IV,Foiled and frustrated them --
5335,IV,On those red fields where blow with furious blow
5336,IV,"Was countered, whether the gigantic fray"
5337,IV,"Rolled by the Meuse or at the Bois Sabot,"
5338,IV,Accents of ours were in the fierce melee;
5339,IV,And on those furthest rims of hallowed ground
5340,IV,"Where the forlorn, the gallant charge expires,"
5341,IV,"When the slain bugler has long ceased to sound,"
5342,IV,And on the tangled wires
5343,IV,"The last wild rally staggers, crumbles, stops,"
5344,IV,Withered beneath the shrapnel's iron showers: --
5345,IV,"Now heaven be thanked, we gave a few brave drops;"
