108,THE FREEMAN,"“_Hope is a slave, Despair is a freeman_”"
109,THE FREEMAN,
110,THE FREEMAN,
111,THE FREEMAN,"A vagabond between the East and West,"
112,THE FREEMAN,Careless I greet the scourging and the rod;
113,THE FREEMAN,"I fear no terror any man may bring,"
114,THE FREEMAN,Nor any god.
115,THE FREEMAN,
116,THE FREEMAN,The clankless chains that bound me I have rent
117,THE FREEMAN,No more a slave to hope I cringe or cry;
118,THE FREEMAN,"Captives to Fate, men rear their prison walls,"
119,THE FREEMAN,But free am I.
120,THE FREEMAN,
121,THE FREEMAN,"I tread where arrows press upon my path,"
122,THE FREEMAN,I smile to see the danger and the dart;
123,THE FREEMAN,"My breast is bared to meet the slings of hate,"
124,THE FREEMAN,But not my heart.
125,THE FREEMAN,
126,THE FREEMAN,"I face the thunder and I face the rain,"
127,THE FREEMAN,"I lift my head, defiance far I fling--"
128,THE FREEMAN,"My feet are set, I face the autumn as"
129,THE FREEMAN,I face the spring.
130,THE FREEMAN,
131,THE FREEMAN,"Around me, on the battle-fields of life,"
132,THE FREEMAN,I see men fight and fail and crouch in prayer;
133,THE FREEMAN,"Aloft I stand unfettered, for I know"
134,THE FREEMAN,The freedom of despair.

167,THE TRAVELLER,
168,THE TRAVELLER,
169,THE TRAVELLER,"The storm clouds swirl against the moon,"
170,THE TRAVELLER,"The hawk flies black across the snow,"
171,THE TRAVELLER,"My steed shies at the shifting gloom,"
172,THE TRAVELLER,The darkness thickens where I go.
173,THE TRAVELLER,"But I ride on when stars are flown,"
174,THE TRAVELLER,As one who journeys to his own.
175,THE TRAVELLER,
176,THE TRAVELLER,From hamlets draped in frozen white
177,THE TRAVELLER,"The flames of ruddy windows fall,"
178,THE TRAVELLER,Above the lashing of the night
179,THE TRAVELLER,I hear the cheerful voices call.
180,THE TRAVELLER,The homely hearths are lit in vain
181,THE TRAVELLER,For one who rides across the plain.
182,THE TRAVELLER,
183,THE TRAVELLER,"The sharp blasts beat upon my breast,"
184,THE TRAVELLER,The wolves bay loud behind my back;
185,THE TRAVELLER,"I greet their howls with jest for jest,"
186,THE TRAVELLER,And laugh to hear them on my track.
187,THE TRAVELLER,"Across the night with terrors sown,"
188,THE TRAVELLER,I spur and journey to my own.
189,THE TRAVELLER,
190,THE TRAVELLER,"From open graves on either side,"
191,THE TRAVELLER,Wan fingers rise and beckon me;
192,THE TRAVELLER,"Old wrongs, uprooted as I ride,"
193,THE TRAVELLER,Cry out that right is yet to be.
194,THE TRAVELLER,"Dead faces throng upon the way,"
195,THE TRAVELLER,Dead voices speak and bid me stay.
196,THE TRAVELLER,
197,THE TRAVELLER,The night hawk flies across the snow--
198,THE TRAVELLER,My way leads past the furthest hill;
199,THE TRAVELLER,"Though beggared to the tryst I go,"
200,THE TRAVELLER,Death waits to woo me to her will.
201,THE TRAVELLER,"I press my spurs, I ride alone,"
202,THE TRAVELLER,I laugh and journey to my own.

208,A PRAYER,
209,A PRAYER,
210,A PRAYER,"Grant me but courage, Lord!"
211,A PRAYER,I ask not that Thou smooth the appointed path;
212,A PRAYER,"I ask not any joys the years afford,"
213,A PRAYER,I ask not even Thine averted wrath.
214,A PRAYER,
215,A PRAYER,Let me but learn to smile--
216,A PRAYER,Let me face lightly any blow that falls;
217,A PRAYER,"Bear bravely with my bondage all the while,"
218,A PRAYER,And hug my freedom within prison walls.
219,A PRAYER,
220,A PRAYER,"Thus when the end draws near,"
221,A PRAYER,"With lifted head let me the potion quaff,"
222,A PRAYER,And so--as one who never learned to fear--

229,A BATTLE CRY,
230,A BATTLE CRY,
231,A BATTLE CRY,I have made my stand at last
232,A BATTLE CRY,Where the thickest foes are found;
233,A BATTLE CRY,"I shall fall as I have fought,"
234,A BATTLE CRY,Yielding inch by inch the ground.
235,A BATTLE CRY,
236,A BATTLE CRY,"I have no surrender given,"
237,A BATTLE CRY,I have measured hate with hate;
238,A BATTLE CRY,"I have never stooped to call,"
239,A BATTLE CRY,“Quarter!” to victorious Fate.
240,A BATTLE CRY,
241,A BATTLE CRY,When sore pressed I have not sought
242,A BATTLE CRY,Aid from comrades in the field;
243,A BATTLE CRY,I have never turned to find
244,A BATTLE CRY,Succour from a friendly shield.
245,A BATTLE CRY,
246,A BATTLE CRY,"This shall be my guerdon gained,"
247,A BATTLE CRY,When the hounds of war are passed:
248,A BATTLE CRY,"“Peace to him who fought alone,"

260,FAME,Whereon to lay his head.
261,FAME,
262,FAME,"In death, where flaming poppies fired the dust,"
263,FAME,They brought a laurel wreath:

273,RESURRECTION,"The trumpet of the Judgment shook the night,"
274,RESURRECTION,Dust quickened and was flesh; grave-clothes were shed;
275,RESURRECTION,"With moaning of strong travail and lament,"
276,RESURRECTION,The sea gave up her dead.
277,RESURRECTION,
278,RESURRECTION,"One, rising from a rotting tomb, beheld"
279,RESURRECTION,The heavens unfold beneath Jehovah’s breath.

287,THE SHADOW,
288,THE SHADOW,
289,THE SHADOW,"It has followed me for years,"
290,THE SHADOW,I have seen It slim and tall;
291,THE SHADOW,"When the day its distance wears,"
292,THE SHADOW,It has lengthened on the wall;
293,THE SHADOW,Slanting black
294,THE SHADOW,"On my track,"
295,THE SHADOW,I have felt Its presence fall.
296,THE SHADOW,
297,THE SHADOW,"Oft I flee at break of day,"
298,THE SHADOW,But It races as I ride;
299,THE SHADOW,"Oft I seek to slink away,"
300,THE SHADOW,But It slouches at my side;
301,THE SHADOW,Or It steals
302,THE SHADOW,"On my heels,"
303,THE SHADOW,As the bridegroom to the bride.
304,THE SHADOW,
305,THE SHADOW,As I roam along the track
306,THE SHADOW,Of the vagrants o’er the leas;
307,THE SHADOW,"Oft I mark one glancing back,"
308,THE SHADOW,And I ask him what he sees--
309,THE SHADOW,But they laugh
310,THE SHADOW,"As they chaff,"
311,THE SHADOW,“’Tis his shadow that he flees!”
312,THE SHADOW,
313,THE SHADOW,"I shall ask of one I love,"
314,THE SHADOW,"Pointing to Its passage fleet,"
315,THE SHADOW,"As along the ways we rove,"
316,THE SHADOW,What It is that haunts the street.
317,THE SHADOW,"She will say,"
318,THE SHADOW,"“Nay, nay, nay,"
319,THE SHADOW,’Tis the shadow at your feet!”
320,THE SHADOW,
321,THE SHADOW,I shall wink and see the trick--
322,THE SHADOW,Do they dream that I am blind?
323,THE SHADOW,"I have but to turn, and quick,"
324,THE SHADOW,On my pathway I shall find
325,THE SHADOW,"That It wags,"
326,THE SHADOW,"And It lags,"
327,THE SHADOW,But It follows close behind.
328,THE SHADOW,
329,THE SHADOW,All the night It hides Its shape
330,THE SHADOW,In the dusk beside my bed;
331,THE SHADOW,"If my vigil I escape,"
332,THE SHADOW,"If I once but turn my head,"
333,THE SHADOW,"While I sleep,"
334,THE SHADOW,"It will creep,"
335,THE SHADOW,Till I lie beneath It dead.
336,THE SHADOW,
337,THE SHADOW,"And the end at last shall come,"
338,THE SHADOW,"Weariness will close my eyes,"
339,THE SHADOW,"I shall fall before It dumb,"
340,THE SHADOW,When unto my heart It flies.
341,THE SHADOW,It will gloat
342,THE SHADOW,"O’er my throat,"
343,THE SHADOW,As Its length upon me lies.

353,JUSTICE,"With brands of fire they branded her,"
354,JUSTICE,And brands of shame.
355,JUSTICE,
356,JUSTICE,She fell beside the road and lay
357,JUSTICE,Silent within the sounding place;
358,JUSTICE,A dog turned from the passers-by
359,JUSTICE,And licked her face.
360,JUSTICE,
361,JUSTICE,Their anger melted into tears;
362,JUSTICE,They wept for her they had disowned--
363,JUSTICE,"They bore her to her grave, and then"
364,JUSTICE,The dog they stoned.

855,DEATH-IN-LIFE,Perchance she is lost where the thickets crowd;
856,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"It is far from the church where a vault she owns,"
857,DEATH-IN-LIFE,And for cover she has but a crumbling shroud.
858,DEATH-IN-LIFE,(_’Tis a mad soul clutched by a demon--hist_!
859,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"_Nay, nay, but the wail of the wind, I wist._)"
860,DEATH-IN-LIFE,
861,DEATH-IN-LIFE,She enters the door with a blast of cold--
862,DEATH-IN-LIFE,She enters to me and to my embrace;
863,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"Her fingers are freed from their fleshly fold,"
864,DEATH-IN-LIFE,The veil is rent from her ashen face.
865,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"To her sheet there lingers a scent of mould,"
866,DEATH-IN-LIFE,Where the wily worms have woven a trace.
867,DEATH-IN-LIFE,(_Hark! is it Love on the writhing rack!_
868,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"_Nay, nay, but the wolves on a shepherd’s track._)"
869,DEATH-IN-LIFE,
870,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"She has taken her seat at my board of pine,"
871,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"We have poured the water and broken the bread,"
872,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"I have pledged her health in the blood-red wine,"
873,DEATH-IN-LIFE,She has bowed to me with her spectral head.
874,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"I am hers forever, as she is mine,"
875,DEATH-IN-LIFE,I shall lie with her in her nuptial bed.
876,DEATH-IN-LIFE,(_Hark! ’tis a stroke on a coffin nail!_
877,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"_Nay, the beat of your heart as the pulses fail!_)"
878,DEATH-IN-LIFE,
879,DEATH-IN-LIFE,From her fleshless lips I have felt her kiss
880,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"(The room is small, but the world is wide)."
881,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"What matter the honours that I shall miss,"
882,DEATH-IN-LIFE,When I find her lying against my side?
883,DEATH-IN-LIFE,From the reefs of Fate God has spared me this--
884,DEATH-IN-LIFE,The love that is long and the breast of a bride.
885,DEATH-IN-LIFE,(_For bone of my bone I have chosen Death!_
886,DEATH-IN-LIFE,"_“Nay, nay--ah, love, I am Life,” she saith._)"
