282,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"Since we have had no stories to-night I will venture, Mr. President,"
283,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,to tell a story that I have heretofore heard at nearly all the
284,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"banquets I have ever attended. It is a story simply, and you must bear"
285,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"with it kindly. It is a story as told by a friend of us all, who is"
286,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"found in all parts of all countries, who is immoderately fond of a"
287,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"funny story, and who, unfortunately, attempts to tell a funny story"
288,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"himself--one that he has been particularly delighted with. Well, he is"
289,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"not a story-teller, and especially he is not a funny story-teller. His"
290,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"funny stories, indeed, are oftentimes touchingly pathetic. But to such"
291,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"a story as he tells, being a good-natured man and kindly disposed, we"
292,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"have to listen, because we do not want to wound his feelings by"
293,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"telling him that we have heard that story a great number of times, and"
294,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,that we have heard it ably told by a great number of people from the
295,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"time we were children. But, as I say, we can not hurt his feelings. We"
296,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,can not stop him. We can not kill him; and so the story generally
297,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"proceeds. He selects a very old story always, and generally tells it"
298,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,in about this fashion:--
299,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,
300,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,I heerd an awful funny thing the other day--ha! ha! I don't know
301,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"whether I kin git it off er not, but, anyhow, I'll tell it to you."
302,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"Well!--le's see now how the fool-thing goes. Oh, yes!--W'y, there was"
303,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"a feller one time--it was durin' the army, and this feller that I"
304,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"started in to tell you about was in the war, and--ha! ha!--there was a"
305,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"big fight a-goin' on, and this feller was in the fight, and it was a"
306,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"big battle and bullets a-flyin' ever' which way, and bombshells"
307,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"a-bu'stin', and cannon-balls a-flyin' 'round promiskus; and this"
308,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"feller right in the midst of it, you know, and all excited and het up,"
309,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,and chargin' away; and the fust thing you know along come a
310,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,cannon-ball and shot his head off--ha! ha! ha! Hold on here a
311,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"minute!--no sir; I'm a-gittin' ahead of my story; no, no; it didn't"
312,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,shoot his _head_ off--I'm gittin' the cart before the horse there--shot
313,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,his _leg_ off; that was the way; shot his leg off; and down the poor
314,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"feller drapped, and, of course, in that condition was perfectly"
315,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"he'pless, you know, but yit with presence o' mind enough to know that"
316,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,he was in a dangerous condition ef somepin' wasn't done fer him right
317,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"away. So he seen a comrade a-chargin' by that he knowed, and he"
318,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,hollers to him and called him by name--I disremember now what the
319,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,feller's name was....
320,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,
321,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"Well, that's got nothin' to do with the story, anyway; he hollers to"
322,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"him, he did, and says, ""Hello, there,"" he says to him; ""here, I want"
323,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"you to come here and give me a lift; I got my leg shot off, and I want"
324,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"you to pack me back to the rear of the battle""--where the doctors"
325,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"always is, you know, during a fight--and he says, ""I want you to pack"
326,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,me back there where I can get med-dy-cinal attention er I'm a dead
327,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"man, fer I got my leg shot off,"" he says, ""and I want you to pack me"
328,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"back there so's the surgeons kin take keer of me."" Well--the feller,"
329,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"as luck would have it, ricko-nized him and run to him and throwed down"
330,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"his own musket, so's he could pick him up; and he stooped down and"
331,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,picked him up and kindo' half-way shouldered him and half-way helt him
332,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"betwixt his arms like, and then he turned and started back with"
333,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"him--ha! ha! ha! Now, mind, the fight was still a-goin' on--and right"
334,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"at the hot of the fight, and the feller, all excited, you know, like"
335,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"he was, and the soldier that had his leg shot off gittin' kindo fainty"
336,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"like, and his head kindo' stuck back over the feller's shoulder that"
337,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,was carryin' him. And he hadn't got more'n a couple o' rods with him
338,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"when another cannon-ball come along and tuk his head off, shore"
339,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,enough!--and the curioust thing about it was--ha! ha!--that the feller
340,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"was a-packin' him didn't know that he had been hit ag'in at all, and"
341,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,back he went--still carryin' the deceased back--ha! ha! ha!--to where
342,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"the doctors could take keer of him--as he thought. Well, his cap'n"
343,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"happened to see him, and he thought it was a ruther cur'ous"
344,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,p'ceedin's--a soldier carryin' a dead body out o' the fight--don't you
345,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"see? And so he hollers at him, and he says to the soldier, the cap'n"
346,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"did, he says, ""Hullo, there; where you goin' with that thing?"" the"
347,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,cap'n said to the soldier who was a-carryin' away the feller that had
348,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"his leg shot off. Well, his head, too, by that time. So he says,"
349,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"""Where you goin' with that thing?"" the cap'n said to the soldier who"
350,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"was a-carryin' away the feller that had his leg shot off. Well, the"
351,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"soldier he stopped--kinder halted, you know, like a private soldier"
352,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"will when his presidin' officer speaks to him--and he says to him,"
353,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"""W'y,"" he says, ""Cap, it's a comrade o' mine and the pore feller has"
354,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"got his leg shot off, and I'm a-packin' him back to where the doctors"
355,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"is; and there was nobody to he'p him, and the feller would 'a' died in"
356,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"his tracks--er track ruther--if it hadn't a-been fer me, and I'm"
357,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,a-packin' him back where the surgeons can take keer of him; where he
358,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"can get medical attendance--er his wife's a widder!"" he says, ""'cause"
359,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"he's got his leg shot off!"" Then _Cap'n_ says, ""You blame fool you, he's"
360,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"got his _head_ shot off."" So then the feller slacked his grip on the"
361,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"body and let it slide down to the ground, and looked at it a minute,"
362,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,"all puzzled, you know, and says, ""W'y, he told me it was his leg!"" Ha!"
363,AS TOLD BEFORE THE NEW ENGLAND SOCIETY IN NEW YORK CITY,ha! ha!

1107,ANOTHER RIDE FROM GHENT TO AIX,Then I cast loose my ulster--each ear-tab let fall--
1108,ANOTHER RIDE FROM GHENT TO AIX,Kicked off both my shoes--let go arctics and all--
1109,ANOTHER RIDE FROM GHENT TO AIX,Stood up with the boys--leaned--patted each head

1202,DREAMS,"head--and oh! how cold her hands were! And they were very hard hands,"
1203,DREAMS,"too, and very heavy--and, horror of horrors!--they were not"
1204,DREAMS,hands--they were claws!--they were iron!--they were like the things I
1205,DREAMS,had seen the hardware man yank nails out of a keg with. I quailed and
1206,DREAMS,shivered till the long and slim and slender old woman jerked my head
1207,DREAMS,"up and snarled spitefully, ""What's the matter with you, bub,"" and I"
1208,DREAMS,"said, ""Nawthin'!"" and she said, ""Don't you dare to lie to me!"" I"
1209,DREAMS,moaned.
1210,DREAMS,
1211,DREAMS,"""Don't you like me?"" she asked."
1212,DREAMS,
1213,DREAMS,I hesitated.
1214,DREAMS,
1215,DREAMS,"""And lie if you dare!"" she said--""Don't you like me?"""
1216,DREAMS,
1217,DREAMS,"""Oomh-oomh!"" said I."
1218,DREAMS,
1219,DREAMS,"""Why?"" said she."
1220,DREAMS,
1221,DREAMS,"""Cos, you're too long--and slim--an'""--"
1222,DREAMS,
1223,DREAMS,"""Go on!"" said she."
1224,DREAMS,
1225,DREAMS,"""--And tall!"" said I."
1226,DREAMS,
1227,DREAMS,"""Ah, ha!"" said she,--""and that's it, hey?"""
1228,DREAMS,
1229,DREAMS,"And then she began to grow shorter and thicker, and fatter and"
1230,DREAMS,squattier.
1231,DREAMS,
1232,DREAMS,"""And how do I suit you now?"" she wheezed at length, when she had"
1233,DREAMS,wilted down to about the size of a large loaf of bread.
1234,DREAMS,
1235,DREAMS,I shook more violently than ever at the fearful spectacle.
1236,DREAMS,
1237,DREAMS,"""How do you like me now?"" she yelped again,--""And don't you lie to me"
1238,DREAMS,"neither, or I'll swaller you whole!"""
1239,DREAMS,
1240,DREAMS,I writhed and hid my face.
1241,DREAMS,
1242,DREAMS,"""Do you like me?"""
1243,DREAMS,
1244,DREAMS,"""No-o-oh!"" I moaned."
1245,DREAMS,
1246,DREAMS,She made another snatch at my hair. I felt her jagged claws sink into
1247,DREAMS,my very brain. I struggled and she laughed hideously.
1248,DREAMS,
1249,DREAMS,"""You don't, hey?"""
1250,DREAMS,
1251,DREAMS,"""Yes, yes, I do. I love you!"" said I."
1252,DREAMS,
1253,DREAMS,"""You lie! You lie!"" She shrieked derisively. ""You know you lie!"" and"
1254,DREAMS,"as I felt the iron talons sinking and gritting in my very brain, with"
1255,DREAMS,"one wild, despairing effort, I awoke."
1256,DREAMS,
1257,DREAMS,"I saw the fire gleaming in the grate, and by the light it made I dimly"
1258,DREAMS,"saw the outline of the old mantelpiece that straddled it, holding the"
1259,DREAMS,"old clock high upon its shoulders. I was awake then, and the little"
1260,DREAMS,squatty woman with her iron talons was a dream! I felt an oily
1261,DREAMS,"gladness stealing over me, and yet I shuddered to be all alone."
1262,DREAMS,
1263,DREAMS,"If only some one were awake, I thought, whose blessed company would"
1264,DREAMS,drown all recollections of that fearful dream; but I dared not stir or
1265,DREAMS,"make a noise. I could only hear the ticking of the clock, and my"
1266,DREAMS,father's sullen snore. I tried to compose my thoughts to pleasant
1267,DREAMS,"themes, but that telescopic old woman in white would rise up and mock"
1268,DREAMS,"my vain appeals, until in fancy I again saw her altitudinous"
1269,DREAMS,proportions dwindling into that repulsive and revengeful figure with
1270,DREAMS,"the iron claws, and I grew restless and attempted to sit up. Heavens!"
1271,DREAMS,something yet held me by the hair. The chill sweat that betokens
1272,DREAMS,speedy dissolution gathered on my brow. I made another effort and
1273,DREAMS,"arose, that deadly clutch yet fastened in my hair. Could it be"
1274,DREAMS,"possible! The short, white woman still held me in her vengeful grasp!"
1275,DREAMS,I could see her white dress showing from behind either of my ears. She
1276,DREAMS,"still clung to me, and with one wild, unearthly cry of ""Pap!"" I"
1277,DREAMS,started round the room.
1278,DREAMS,
1279,DREAMS,"I remember nothing further, until as the glowing morn sifted through"
1280,DREAMS,"the maple at the window, powdering with gold the drear old room, and"
1281,DREAMS,baptizing with its radiance the anxious group of old home-faces
1282,DREAMS,"leaning over my bed, I heard my father's voice once more rasping on my"
1283,DREAMS,"senses--""Now get the booby up, and wash that infernal wax out of his"
1284,DREAMS,"hair!"""

1898,IMITATED,He knew the earth--the air--the sky;
1899,IMITATED,"He knew when it would blow or rain,"
1900,IMITATED,And when the weather would be dry:
1901,IMITATED,The blended blades of grass spake out
1902,IMITATED,To him when Redskins were about;
1903,IMITATED,"The wagon tracks would tell him too,"
1904,IMITATED,The very day that they rolled through:
1905,IMITATED,He knew their burden--whence they came--
1906,IMITATED,"If any horse along were lame,"
1907,IMITATED,And what its owner ought to do;
1908,IMITATED,"He knew when it would snow; he knew,"
1909,IMITATED,"By some strange intuition, when"
1910,IMITATED,The buffalo would overflow
1911,IMITATED,"The prairies like a flood, and then"
1912,IMITATED,Recede in their stampede again.
1913,IMITATED,"He knew all things--yea, he did know"
1914,IMITATED,"The brand of liquor in my flask,"
1915,IMITATED,"And many times did tilt it up,"
1916,IMITATED,"Nor halt or hesitate one whit,"
1917,IMITATED,Nor pause to slip the silver cup
1918,IMITATED,"From off its crystal base, nor ask"
1919,IMITATED,Why I preferred to drink from it.
1920,IMITATED,"And more and more I plied him, and"
1921,IMITATED,"Did query of him o'er and o'er,"
1922,IMITATED,And seek to lure from him the lore
1923,IMITATED,By which the man did understand
1924,IMITATED,These hidden things of sky and land:
1925,IMITATED,"And, wrought upon, he sudden drew"
1926,IMITATED,"His bridle--wheeled, and caught my hand--"
1927,IMITATED,"Pressed it, as one that loved me true,"
1928,IMITATED,And bade me listen.
1929,IMITATED,................... There be few
1930,IMITATED,Like tales as strange to listen to!
1931,IMITATED,"He told me all--How, when a child,"
1932,IMITATED,The Indians stole him--there he laughed--
1933,IMITATED,"""They stole me, and I stole their craft!"""
1934,IMITATED,"Then slowly winked both eyes, and smiled,"
1935,IMITATED,"And went on ramblingly,--""And they--"
1936,IMITATED,"They reared me, and I ran away--"

1941,IMITATED,My feet ere human hands again
1942,IMITATED,"Were reached to me in my distress,--"
1943,IMITATED,"And lo, since then not any rain"
1944,IMITATED,"May fall upon me anywhere,"
1945,IMITATED,Nor any cyclone's cussedness
1946,IMITATED,"Slip up behind me unaware,--"
1947,IMITATED,"Nor any change of cold, or heat,"
1948,IMITATED,"Or blow, or snow, but I do know"
1949,IMITATED,"It's coming, days and days before;--"
1950,IMITATED,I know it by my frozen feet--
1951,IMITATED,"I know it by my itching heels,"
1952,IMITATED,And by the agony one feels
1953,IMITATED,Who knows that scratching nevermore
1954,IMITATED,Will bring to him the old and sweet

1956,IMITATED,With knowledge that a certain cloud
1957,IMITATED,"Will burst with storm on such a day,"
1958,IMITATED,"And when a snow will fall, and--nay,"

2029,HER LIGHT GUITAR,"A low, sweet jangle of tangled sounds,"
2030,HER LIGHT GUITAR,"As blurred as the voices of the fairies are,"
2031,HER LIGHT GUITAR,Dancing in moondawn dales and downs;
2032,HER LIGHT GUITAR,And the tinkling drip of the strange refrain
2033,HER LIGHT GUITAR,Ran over the rim of my soul like rain.

2035,HER LIGHT GUITAR,The great blond moon in the midnight skies
2036,HER LIGHT GUITAR,"Paused and poised o'er the trellis eaves,"

2038,HER LIGHT GUITAR,"Sifted their love through the rifted leaves,"
2039,HER LIGHT GUITAR,Glittered and splintered in crystal mist
2040,HER LIGHT GUITAR,Down the glittering strings that her fingers kissed.
2041,HER LIGHT GUITAR,
2042,HER LIGHT GUITAR,O the melody mad! O the tinkle and thrill
2043,HER LIGHT GUITAR,Of the ecstasy of the exquisite thing!
2044,HER LIGHT GUITAR,The red rose dropped from the window-sill
2045,HER LIGHT GUITAR,And lay in a long swoon quivering;
2046,HER LIGHT GUITAR,While the dying notes of the strain divine
2047,HER LIGHT GUITAR,Rippled in glee up my spellbound spine.

2307,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,It was a dim and chill and loveless afternoon in the late fall of
2308,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,eighty-three when I first saw the genial subject of this hasty sketch.
2309,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,From time to time the daily paper on which I worked had been
2310,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"receiving, among the general literary driftage of amateur essayists,"
2311,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"poets and sketch-writers, some conceits in verse that struck the"
2312,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"editorial head as decidedly novel; and, as they were evidently the"
2313,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"production of an unlettered man, and an _old_ man, and a farmer at that,"
2314,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"they were usually spared the waste-basket, and preserved--not for"
2315,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"publication, but to pass from hand to hand among the members of the"
2316,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,staff as simply quaint and mirth-provoking specimens of the verdancy
2317,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,of both the venerable author and the Muse inspiring him. Letters as
2318,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"quaint as were the poems invariably accompanied them, and the oddity"
2319,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"of these, in fact, had first called attention to the verses. I well"
2320,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,remember the general merriment of the office when the first of the old
2321,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"man's letters was read aloud, and I recall, too, some of his comments"
2322,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"on his own verse, verbatim. In one place he said: ""I make no doubt you"
2323,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"will find some purty _sad_ spots in my poetry, considerin'; but I hope"
2324,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"you will bear in mind that I am a great sufferer with rheumatizum, and"
2325,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"have been, off and on, sence the cold New Year's. In the main,"
2326,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"however,"" he continued, ""I allus aim to write in a cheerful,"
2327,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"comfortin' sperit, so's ef the stuff hangs fire, and don't do no good,"
2328,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"it hain't a-goin' to do no harm,--and them's my honest views on"
2329,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"poetry."""
2330,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
2331,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"In another letter, evidently suspecting his poem had not appeared in"
2332,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"print because of its dejected tone, he said: ""The poetry I herewith"
2333,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,send was wrote off on the finest Autumn day I ever laid eyes on! I
2334,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,never felt better in my life. The morning air was as invigoratin' as
2335,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"bitters with tanzy in it, and the folks at breakfast said they never"
2336,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,saw such a' appetite on mortal man before. Then I lit out for the
2337,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"barn, and after feedin', I come back and tuck my pen and ink out on"
2338,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"the porch, and jest cut loose. I writ and writ till my fingers was"
2339,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,that cramped I couldn't hardly let go of the penholder. And the poem I
2340,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,send you is the upshot of it all. Ef you don't find it cheerful enough
2341,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"fer your columns, I'll have to knock under, that's all!"" And that"
2342,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"poem, as I recall it, certainly was cheerful enough for publication,"
2343,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"only the ""copy"" was almost undecipherable, and the ink, too, so pale"
2344,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"and vague, it was thought best to reserve the verses, for the time, at"
2345,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"least, and later on revise, copy, punctuate, and then print it"
2346,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"sometime, as much for the joke of it as anything. But it was still"
2347,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"delayed, neglected, and in a week's time almost entirely forgotten."
2348,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"And so it was, upon this chill and sombre afternoon I speak of that an"
2349,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,event occurred which most pleasantly reminded me of both the poem with
2350,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"the ""sad spots"" in it, and the ""cheerful"" one, ""writ out on the porch"""
2351,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,that glorious autumn day that poured its glory through the old man's
2352,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,letter to us.
2353,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
2354,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,Outside and in the sanctum the gloom was too oppressive to permit an
2355,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,elevated tendency of either thought or spirit. I could do nothing but
2356,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"sit listless and inert. Paper and pencil were before me, but I could"
2357,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"not write--I could not even think coherently, and was on the point of"
2358,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"rising and rushing out into the streets for a wild walk, when there"
2359,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,came a hesitating knock at the door.
2360,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
2361,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"""Come in!"" I snarled, grabbing up my pencil and assuming a frightfully"
2362,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"industrious air: ""Come in!"" I almost savagely repeated, ""Come in! And"
2363,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"shut the door behind you!"" and I dropped my lids, bent my gaze fixedly"
2364,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,upon the blank pages before me and began scrawling some disconnected
2365,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,nothings with no head or tail or anything.
2366,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
2367,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"""Sir; howdy,"" said a low and pleasant voice. And at once, in spite of"
2368,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"my perverse resolve, I looked up. I someway felt rebuked."
2369,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,
2370,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"The speaker was very slowly, noiselessly closing the door. I could"
2371,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"hardly face him when he turned around. An old man, of sixty-five, at"
2372,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"least, but with a face and an eye of the most cheery and wholesome"
2373,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,expression I had ever seen in either youth or age. Over his broad
2374,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"bronzed forehead and white hair he wore a low-crowned, wide-brimmed"
2375,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"black felt hat, somewhat rusted now, and with the band grease-crusted,"
2376,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"and the binding frayed at intervals, and sagging from the threads that"
2377,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"held it on. An old-styled frock coat of black, dull brown in streaks,"
2378,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,and quite shiny about the collar and lapels. A waistcoat of no
2379,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"describable material or pattern, and a clean white shirt and collar of"
2380,BENJ. F. JOHNSON VISITS THE EDITOR,"one piece, with a black string-tie and double bow, which would have"

3740,FATHER AND SON,
3741,FATHER AND SON,Mr. Judkins' boy came home yesterday with a bottle of bugs in his
3742,FATHER AND SON,"pocket, and as the quiet little fellow sat on the back porch in his"
3743,FATHER AND SON,"favorite position, his legs elbowed and flattened out beneath him like"
3744,FATHER AND SON,"a letter ""W,"" his genial and eccentric father came suddenly upon him."
3745,FATHER AND SON,
3746,FATHER AND SON,"""And what's the blame' boy up to now?"" said Mr. Judkins, in an assumed"
3747,FATHER AND SON,"tone of querulous displeasure, as he bent over the boy from behind and"
3748,FATHER AND SON,gently tweaked his ear.
3749,FATHER AND SON,
3750,FATHER AND SON,"""Oh, here, mister!"" said the boy, without looking up; ""you thist let"
3751,FATHER AND SON,"up on that, will you!"""
3752,FATHER AND SON,
3753,FATHER AND SON,"""What you got there, I tell you!"" continued the smiling Mr. Judkins,"
3754,FATHER AND SON,"in a still gruffer tone, relinquishing the boy's ear, and gazing down"
3755,FATHER AND SON,"upon the fluffy towhead with more than ordinary admiration. ""What you"
3756,FATHER AND SON,"got there?"""
3757,FATHER AND SON,
3758,FATHER AND SON,"""Bugs,"" said the boy--""you know!"""
3759,FATHER AND SON,
3760,FATHER AND SON,"""Dead, are they?"" said Mr. Judkins."
3761,FATHER AND SON,
3762,FATHER AND SON,"""Some of 'em's dead,"" said the boy, carefully running a needle through"
3763,FATHER AND SON,"the back of a large bumblebee. ""All these uns is, you kin bet! You"
3764,FATHER AND SON,"don't think a feller 'ud try to string a live bumblebee, I reckon?"""
3765,FATHER AND SON,
3766,FATHER AND SON,"""Well, no, 'Squire,"" said Mr. Judkins, airily, addressing the boy by"
3767,FATHER AND SON,"one of the dozen nicknames he had given him; ""not a live bumblebee--a"
3768,FATHER AND SON,"real stem-winder, of course not. But what in the name o' limpin'"
3769,FATHER AND SON,"Lazarus air you stringin' 'em fer?"""
3770,FATHER AND SON,
3771,FATHER AND SON,"""Got a live snake-feeder,"" said the boy, ignoring the parental"
3772,FATHER AND SON,"inquiry. ""See him down there in the bottom, 'ith all th' other uns on"
3773,FATHER AND SON,"top of him. Thist watch him now, an' you kin see him pant. I kin. Yes,"
3774,FATHER AND SON,"an' I got a beetle 'at's purt' nigh alive, too--on'y he can't pull in"
3775,FATHER AND SON,"his other wings. See 'em?"" continued the boy, with growing enthusiasm,"
3776,FATHER AND SON,"twirling the big-mouthed bottle like a kaleidoscope. ""Hate beetles!"
3777,FATHER AND SON,"'cause they allus act so big, an' make s'much fuss about theirselves,"
3778,FATHER AND SON,an' don't know nothin' neither! Bet ef I had as many wings as a beetle
3779,FATHER AND SON,I wouldn't let no boy my size knock the stuffin' out o' me with no
3780,FATHER AND SON,"bunch o' weeds, like I done him!"""
3781,FATHER AND SON,
3782,FATHER AND SON,"""Howd'ye know you wouldn't?"" said Mr. Judkins, austerely, biting his"
3783,FATHER AND SON,nails and winking archly to himself.
3784,FATHER AND SON,
3785,FATHER AND SON,"""W'y, I know I wouldn't,"" said the boy, ""'cause I'd keep up in the air"
3786,FATHER AND SON,"where I could fly, an' wouldn't come low down ut all--bumpin' around"
3787,FATHER AND SON,"'mongst them bushes, an' buzzin' against things, an' buttin' my brains"

3789,FATHER AND SON,
3790,FATHER AND SON,"""'Spect you'd ruther be a snake-feeder, wouldn't you, Bud?"" said Mr."
3791,FATHER AND SON,"Judkins suggestively. ""Snake-feeders has got about enough wings to"
3792,FATHER AND SON,"suit you, ef you want more'n one pair, and ever' day's a picnic with a"

3794,FATHER AND SON,"crick, and roost on reeds and cat-tails, er fool around a feller's"
3795,FATHER AND SON,fish-line and light on the cork and bob up and down with it till she
3796,FATHER AND SON,"goes clean under, don't you know?"""
3797,FATHER AND SON,
3798,FATHER AND SON,"""Don't want to be no snake-feeder, neither,"" said the boy, ""'cause"
3799,FATHER AND SON,"they gits gobbled up, first thing they know, by these 'ere big green"
3800,FATHER AND SON,bullfrogs ut they can't ever tell from the skum till they've lit right
3801,FATHER AND SON,"in their mouth--and then they're goners! No, sir;"" continued the boy,"
3802,FATHER AND SON,"drawing an extra quinine-bottle from another pocket, and holding it up"
3803,FATHER AND SON,"admiringly before his father's eyes: ""There's the feller in there ut"

3805,FATHER AND SON,
3806,FATHER AND SON,"""W'y, it's a nasty p'izen spider!"" exclaimed Mr. Judkins, pushing back"
3807,FATHER AND SON,"the bottle with affected abhorrence, ""and he's alive, too!"""
3808,FATHER AND SON,
3809,FATHER AND SON,"""You bet he's alive!"" said the boy, ""an' you kin bet he'll never come"
3810,FATHER AND SON,"to no harm while I own him!"" and as the little fellow spoke his face"
3811,FATHER AND SON,"glowed with positive affection, and the twinkle of his eyes, as he"
3812,FATHER AND SON,"continued, seemed wonderfully like his father's own. ""Tell you, I like"
3813,FATHER AND SON,"spiders! Spiders is awful fat--all but their head--and that's level,"
3814,FATHER AND SON,you kin bet! Flies hain't got no business with a spider. Ef a spider
3815,FATHER AND SON,"ever reaches fer a fly, he's his meat! The spider, he likes to loaf"
3816,FATHER AND SON,an' lay around in the shade an' wait fer flies an' bugs an' things to
3817,FATHER AND SON,come a-foolin' round his place. He lays back in the hole in the corner
3818,FATHER AND SON,"of his web, an' waits till somepin' lights on it an' nen when he hears"
3819,FATHER AND SON,"'em buzzin', he thist crawls out an' fixes 'em so's they can't buzz,"
3820,FATHER AND SON,an' he's got the truck to do it with! I bet ef you'd unwind all the
3821,FATHER AND SON,"web-stuff out of thist one little spider not bigger'n a pill, it 'ud"
3822,FATHER AND SON,be long enough fer a kite-string! Onc't they wuz one in our
3823,FATHER AND SON,"wood-house, an' a taterbug got stuck in his web, an' the spider worked"
3824,FATHER AND SON,purt' nigh two days 'fore he got him so's he couldn't move. Nen he
3825,FATHER AND SON,"couldn't eat him neither--'cause they's shells on 'em, you know, an'"
3826,FATHER AND SON,the spider didn't know how to hull him. Ever' time I'd go there the
3827,FATHER AND SON,"spider, he'd be a-wrappin' more stuff around th' ole bug, an' stoopin'"
3828,FATHER AND SON,"down like he wuz a-whisperin' to him. An' one day I went in ag'in, an'"
3829,FATHER AND SON,"he was a-hangin', alas an' cold in death! An' I poked him with a"
3830,FATHER AND SON,splinter an' his web broke off--'spect he'd used it all up on the
3831,FATHER AND SON,wicked bug--an' it killed him; an' I buried him in a' ink-bottle an'
3832,FATHER AND SON,"mashed the old bug 'ith a chip!"""
3833,FATHER AND SON,
3834,FATHER AND SON,"""Yes,"" said Judkins, in a horrified tone, turning away to conceal the"
3835,FATHER AND SON,"real zest and enjoyment his face must have betrayed; ""yes, and some"
3836,FATHER AND SON,"day you'll come home p'izened, er somepin'! And I want to say right"
3837,FATHER AND SON,"here, my young man, ef ever you do, and it don't kill you, I'll lint"
3838,FATHER AND SON,"you within an inch of your life!"" And as the eccentric Mr. Judkins"
3839,FATHER AND SON,whirled around the corner of the porch he heard the boy murmur in his

3915,ON PIRUTS,his shame fer those he loved. In the dead of night he stol'd a new

3937,ON HACKMENS,Hackmens has the softest thing in the bizness. They hain't got nothin'
3938,ON HACKMENS,to do but look hump-shouldered an' chaw tobacker an' wait. Hackmens
3939,ON HACKMENS,"all looks like detectives, an' keeps still, an' never even spits when"
3940,ON HACKMENS,you walk past 'em. An' they're allus cold. A hackman that stands high
3941,ON HACKMENS,in the p'fession kin wear a overcoat in dog-days an' then look chilly
3942,ON HACKMENS,"an' like his folks wuz all dead but the old man, an' he wuz a"
3943,ON HACKMENS,drunkard. Ef a hackman would on'y be a blind fiddler he'd take in more
3944,ON HACKMENS,money than a fair-ground. Hackmens never gives nothin' away. You kin
3945,ON HACKMENS,trust a hackman when you can't trust your own mother. Some people
3946,ON HACKMENS,thinks when they hire a hack to take 'em some place that the hackman
3947,ON HACKMENS,has got some grudge ag'in' 'em--but he hain't--he's allus that way. He
3948,ON HACKMENS,"loves you but he knows his place, and smothers his real feelings. In"
3949,ON HACKMENS,life's giddy scenes hackmens all wears a mask; but down deep in their
3950,ON HACKMENS,heart you kin bet they are yourn till deth. Some hackmens look like
3951,ON HACKMENS,"they wuz stuck up, but they hain't--it's only 'cause they got on so"
3952,ON HACKMENS,much clothes. Onc't a hackman wuz stabbed by a friend of his in the
3953,ON HACKMENS,"same bizness, an' when the doctors wuz seein' how bad he wuz karved"
3954,ON HACKMENS,"up, they found he had on five shurts. They said that wuz all that"
3955,ON HACKMENS,"saved his life. They said ef he'd on'y had on four shurts, he'd 'a'"
3956,ON HACKMENS,"been a ded man. An' the hackman hissef, when he got well, used to brag"
3957,ON HACKMENS,"it wuz the closetest call he ever had, an' laid fer the other hackman,"
3958,ON HACKMENS,"an' hit him with a car couplin' an' killed him, an' come mighty nigh"
3959,ON HACKMENS,goin' to the penitenchary fer it. Influenshal friends wuz all that
3960,ON HACKMENS,saved him that time. No five shurts would 'a' done it. The mayor said
3961,ON HACKMENS,"that when he let him off, an' brought down the house, an' made hissef"
3962,ON HACKMENS,"a strong man fer another term. Some mayors is purty slick, but a"
3963,ON HACKMENS,humble hackman may sometimes turn out to be thist as smooth. The on'y
3964,ON HACKMENS,thing w'y a hackman don't show up no better is 'cause he loses so much
3965,ON HACKMENS,"sleep. That's why he allus looks like he had the headache, an' didn't"
3966,ON HACKMENS,care ef he did. Onc't a hackman wuz waitin' in front of a hotel one
3967,ON HACKMENS,"morning an' wuz sort o' dozin' like, an' fell off his seat. An' they"
3968,ON HACKMENS,"run an' picked him up, an' he wuz unconshus, an' they worked with him"
3969,ON HACKMENS,till 'way long in the afternoon 'fore they found out he wuz thist

4051,THE CROSS-EYED GIRL,and she used to amuse herself by watchin' 'em curl up as I'd be

4053,THE CROSS-EYED GIRL,"jealous disposition, you know, and so, at last, I jes' casually hinted"

4060,THE CROSS-EYED GIRL,"reality, she only had one off eye--the right eye, ef I don't"
4061,THE CROSS-EYED GIRL,disremember--the other one was as square as a gouge. And that girl

4086,HOMESICKNESS,"say right here that of all diseases, afflictions er complaints, this"

4089,HOMESICKNESS,"bone-erysipelas, that he's to be looked up to as bein' purty well"

4095,HOMESICKNESS,"You see, there's no way of treatin' homesickness only one--and that is"
4096,HOMESICKNESS,to git back home--but as that's a remedy you can't git at no drug
4097,HOMESICKNESS,"store, at so much per box--and ef you could, fer instance, and only"

4116,HOMESICKNESS,"his reclinin' chair, and walks him up and down the car, and runs him"

4294,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"His presence, all-commanding, as his thought"

4303,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4304,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,And so he played with it--joyed at its call--
4305,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Ran rioting with it, forgetting all"

4307,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"A devotee of learning, still the same!"
4308,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4309,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"In fancy, even now we catch the glance"
4310,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Of the rapt eye and radiant countenance,"
4311,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"As when his discourse, like a woodland stream,"
4312,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,Flowed musically on from theme to theme:
4313,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4314,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"The skies, the stars, the mountains, and the sea,"
4315,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,He worshipped as their high divinity--
4316,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,Nor did his reverent spirit find one thing
4317,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,On earth too lowly for his worshipping.
4318,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4319,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"The weed, the rose, the wildwood or the plain,"
4320,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"The teeming harvest, or the blighted grain--"
4321,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"All--all were fashioned beautiful and good,"
4322,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,As the soul saw and senses understood.
4323,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4324,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Thus broadly based, his spacious faith and love"
4325,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,Enfolded all below as all above--
4326,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Nay, ev'n if overmuch he loved mankind,"
4327,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,He gave his love's vast largess as designed.
4328,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4329,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Therefore, in fondest, faithful service, he"
4330,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,Wrought ever bravely for humanity--
4331,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Stood, first of heroes for the Right allied--"
4332,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Foes, even, grieving, when (for them) he died."
4333,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4334,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"This was the man we loved--are loving yet,"
4335,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,And still shall love while longing eyes are wet
4336,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,With selfish tears that well were brushed away
4337,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,Remembering his smile of yesterday.--
4338,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,
4339,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"For, even as we knew him, smiling still,"
4340,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,"Somewhere beyond all earthly ache or ill,"
4341,JOHN CLARK RIDPATH,He waits with the old welcome--just as when

4853,THE OBJECT LESSON,Barely a year ago I attended the Friday afternoon exercises of a

4855,THE OBJECT LESSON,"mind with such material as might be gathered, for a ""valedictory,"""
4856,THE OBJECT LESSON,"which, I regret to say, was to be handed down to posterity under"
4857,THE OBJECT LESSON,another signature than my own.
4858,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4859,THE OBJECT LESSON,"There was present, among a host of visitors, a pale young man of"
4860,THE OBJECT LESSON,"perhaps thirty years, with a tall head and bulging brow and a highly"
4861,THE OBJECT LESSON,intellectual pair of eyes and spectacles. He wore his hair without
4862,THE OBJECT LESSON,"roach or ""part"" and the smile he beamed about him was ""a joy forever."""
4863,THE OBJECT LESSON,"He was an educator--from the East, I think I heard it rumoured--anyway"
4864,THE OBJECT LESSON,"he was introduced to the school at last, and he bowed, and smiled, and"
4865,THE OBJECT LESSON,"beamed upon us all, and entertained us after the most delightfully"
4866,THE OBJECT LESSON,edifying manner imaginable. And although I may fail to reproduce the
4867,THE OBJECT LESSON,"exact substance of his remarks upon that highly important occasion, I"
4868,THE OBJECT LESSON,think I can at least present his theme in all its coherency of detail.
4869,THE OBJECT LESSON,"Addressing more particularly the primary department of the school, he"
4870,THE OBJECT LESSON,said:--
4871,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4872,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""As the little exercise I am about to introduce is of recent origin,"
4873,THE OBJECT LESSON,"and the bright, intelligent faces of the pupils before me seem rife"
4874,THE OBJECT LESSON,"with eager and expectant interest, it will be well for me, perhaps, to"
4875,THE OBJECT LESSON,"offer by way of preparatory preface, a few terse words of explanation."
4876,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4877,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""The Object Lesson is designed to fill a long-felt want, and is"
4878,THE OBJECT LESSON,"destined, as I think, to revolutionize, in a great degree, the"
4879,THE OBJECT LESSON,"educational systems of our land.--In my belief, the Object Lesson will"
4880,THE OBJECT LESSON,supply a want which I may safely say has heretofore left the most
4881,THE OBJECT LESSON,egregious and palpable traces of mental confusion and intellectual
4882,THE OBJECT LESSON,"inadequacies stamped, as it were, upon the gleaming reasons of the"
4883,THE OBJECT LESSON,"most learned--the highest cultured, and the most eminently gifted and"
4884,THE OBJECT LESSON,promising of our professors and scientists both at home and abroad.
4885,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4886,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""Now this deficiency--if it may be so termed--plainly has a beginning;"
4887,THE OBJECT LESSON,"and probing deeply with the bright, clean scalpel of experience we"
4888,THE OBJECT LESSON,"discover that--'As the twig is bent the tree's inclined.' To remedy,"
4889,THE OBJECT LESSON,"then, a deeply seated error which for so long has rankled at the very"
4890,THE OBJECT LESSON,"root of educational progress throughout the land, many plausible, and"
4891,THE OBJECT LESSON,"we must admit, many helpful theories have been introduced to allay the"
4892,THE OBJECT LESSON,painful errors resulting from the discrepancy of which we speak: but
4893,THE OBJECT LESSON,"until now, nothing that seemed wholly to eradicate the defect has been"
4894,THE OBJECT LESSON,"discovered, and that, too, strange as it may seem, is, at last,"
4895,THE OBJECT LESSON,"emanating, like the mighty river, from the simplest source, but"
4896,THE OBJECT LESSON,"broadening and gathering in force and power as it flows along, until,"
4897,THE OBJECT LESSON,"at last, its grand and mighty current sweeps on in majesty to the vast"
4898,THE OBJECT LESSON,illimitable ocean of--of--of--Success! Ahem!
4899,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4900,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""And, now, little boys and girls, that we have had by implication, a"
4901,THE OBJECT LESSON,clear and comprehensive explanation of the Object Lesson and its

4903,THE OBJECT LESSON,endeavor--in my humble way--to direct your newly acquired knowledge
4904,THE OBJECT LESSON,through the proper channel. For instance:--
4905,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4906,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""This little object I hold in my hand--who will designate it by its"
4907,THE OBJECT LESSON,"proper name? Come, now, let us see who will be the first to answer. 'A"
4908,THE OBJECT LESSON,"peanut,' says the little boy here at my right. Very good--very good! I"
4909,THE OBJECT LESSON,"hold, then, in my hand, a peanut. And now who will tell me, what is"
4910,THE OBJECT LESSON,the peanut? A very simple question--who will answer? 'Something good
4911,THE OBJECT LESSON,"to eat,' says the little girl. Yes, 'something good to eat,' but would"
4912,THE OBJECT LESSON,it not be better to say simply that the peanut is an edible? I think
4913,THE OBJECT LESSON,"so, yes. The peanut, then, is--an edible--now, all together, an"
4914,THE OBJECT LESSON,edible!
4915,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4916,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""To what kingdom does the peanut belong? The animal, vegetable, or"
4917,THE OBJECT LESSON,"mineral kingdom? A very easy question. Come, let us have prompt"
4918,THE OBJECT LESSON,"answers. 'The animal kingdom,' does the little boy say? Oh, no! The"
4919,THE OBJECT LESSON,peanut does not belong to the animal kingdom! Surely the little boy
4920,THE OBJECT LESSON,"must be thinking of a larger object than the peanut--the elephant,"
4921,THE OBJECT LESSON,"perhaps. To what kingdom, then, does the peanut belong? The"
4922,THE OBJECT LESSON,"v-v-veg--'The vegetable kingdom,' says the bright-faced little girl on"
4923,THE OBJECT LESSON,the back seat. Ah! that is better. We find then that the peanut
4924,THE OBJECT LESSON,"belongs to the--what kingdom? The 'vegetable kingdom.' Very good, very"
4925,THE OBJECT LESSON,good!
4926,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4927,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""And now who will tell us of what the peanut is composed. Let us have"
4928,THE OBJECT LESSON,quick responses now. Time is fleeting! Of what is the peanut composed?
4929,THE OBJECT LESSON,"'The hull and the goody,' some one answers. Yes, 'the hull and the"
4930,THE OBJECT LESSON,"goody' in vulgar parlance, but how much better it would be to say"
4931,THE OBJECT LESSON,"simply, the shell and the kernel. Would not that sound better? Yes, I"
4932,THE OBJECT LESSON,thought you would agree with me there!
4933,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4934,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""And now who will tell me the color of the peanut! And be careful now!"
4935,THE OBJECT LESSON,for I shouldn't like to hear you make the very stupid blunder I once
4936,THE OBJECT LESSON,heard a little boy make in reply to the same question. Would you like
4937,THE OBJECT LESSON,to hear what color the stupid little boy said the peanut was? You
4938,THE OBJECT LESSON,"would, eh? Well, now, how many of you would like to hear what color"
4939,THE OBJECT LESSON,"the stupid little boy said the peanut was? Come now, let's have an"
4940,THE OBJECT LESSON,expression. All who would like to hear what color the stupid little
4941,THE OBJECT LESSON,"boy said the peanut was, may hold up their right hands. Very good,"
4942,THE OBJECT LESSON,"very good--there, that will do."
4943,THE OBJECT LESSON,
4944,THE OBJECT LESSON,"""Well, it was during a professional visit I was once called upon to"
4945,THE OBJECT LESSON,"make to a neighboring city, where I was invited to address the"
4946,THE OBJECT LESSON,"children of a free school--Hands down, now, little boy--founded for"
4947,THE OBJECT LESSON,"the exclusive benefit of the little newsboys and bootblacks, who, it"
4948,THE OBJECT LESSON,"seems, had not the means to defray the expenses of the commonest"
4949,THE OBJECT LESSON,"educational accessories, and during an object lessen--identical with"
4950,THE OBJECT LESSON,the one before us now--for it is a favorite one of mine--I propounded
4951,THE OBJECT LESSON,"the question, what is the color of the peanut? Many answers were given"
4952,THE OBJECT LESSON,"in response, but none as sufficiently succinct and apropos as I deemed"
4953,THE OBJECT LESSON,"the facts demanded; and so at last I personally addressed a ragged,"
4954,THE OBJECT LESSON,"but, as I then thought, a bright-eyed little fellow, when judge of my"
4955,THE OBJECT LESSON,"surprise, in reply to my question what is the color of the peanut, the"
4956,THE OBJECT LESSON,"little fellow, without the slightest gleam of intelligence lighting up"
4957,THE OBJECT LESSON,"his face, answered, that 'if not scorched in roasting, the peanut was"
4958,THE OBJECT LESSON,"a blond.' Why, I was almost tempted to join in the general merriment"
4959,THE OBJECT LESSON,his inapposite reply elicited. But I occupy your attention with
4960,THE OBJECT LESSON,trivial things; and as I notice the time allotted to me has slipped
4961,THE OBJECT LESSON,"away, we will drop the peanut for the present. Trusting the few facts"
4962,THE OBJECT LESSON,gleaned from a topic so homely and unpromising will sink deep in your
4963,THE OBJECT LESSON,"minds, in time to bloom and blossom in the fields of future"
4964,THE OBJECT LESSON,"usefulness--I--I----I thank you."""
