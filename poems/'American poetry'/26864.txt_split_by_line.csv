37,PREFACE,
38,PREFACE,_This little volume was written for no reason on earth and with no
39,PREFACE,"earthly reason. It just simply happened, on the principle, I suppose"
40,PREFACE,"that ""murder will out."" Murder is a bad thing and so are nonsense"
41,PREFACE,rhymes. There is often a valid excuse for murder; there is none for
42,PREFACE,nonsense rhymes. They seem to be a necessary evil to be classed with
43,PREFACE,"smallpox, chicken-pox, yellow fever and other irruptive diseases. They"
44,PREFACE,are also on the order of the boomerang and eventually rebound and
45,PREFACE,inflict much suffering on the unlucky verse-slinger. So you see
46,PREFACE,"nonsense, like a little learning is a dangerous thing and should be"
47,PREFACE,handled with as much care as the shotgun which is never known to be
48,PREFACE,loaded._
49,PREFACE,
50,PREFACE,_A man who writes nonsense may become in time a big gun. But this is
51,PREFACE,rare; more often he becomes a small bore. This appears paradoxical and
52,PREFACE,"will probably require thinking over, but the more you think it over the"
53,PREFACE,less you will understand. This is true of parlor magic. It is also true
54,PREFACE,of the magazine poets. It really never pays to think. Thinking is too
55,PREFACE,much like work. After reading these rhymes you will not think that the
56,PREFACE,"writer ever did think, which after all is the right way to think._"
57,PREFACE,
58,PREFACE,"_When Dryden wrote ""Alexander's Feast"" he modestly stated that it was"
59,PREFACE,the grandest poem ever written. Mr. Dryden evidently believed this or
60,PREFACE,he wouldn't have said so. But then every one did not agree with Mr.
61,PREFACE,Dryden. Now I am going one step further and will positively state that
62,PREFACE,the writer of this volume is the greatest poetical genius who has not
63,PREFACE,yet died in infancy._
64,PREFACE,
65,PREFACE,_This is an astounding statement but it can be corroborated by admiring
66,PREFACE,"friends, for the writer is like a certain brand of children's food in"
67,PREFACE,that he is advertised by his loving friends._
68,PREFACE,
69,PREFACE,"_Speaking of ""Alexander's Feast"" it simply cannot be compared to any"
70,PREFACE,"one of the finished, poetic gems in this collection because it is so"
71,PREFACE,utterly different. The difference is what made Dryden famous. But
72,PREFACE,"comparisons are odious, and Mr. Dryden has been dead several years._"
73,PREFACE,
74,PREFACE,"_""But what,"" you may ask, ""is the object of nonsense verse?"" Most"
75,PREFACE,"assuredly to make one laugh. That masterpiece of nonsense ""Alice In"
76,PREFACE,"Wonderland"" and its companion volume ""Through The Looking Class"" are"
77,PREFACE,"absurd books, but their very absurdity is what appeals to us most."
78,PREFACE,"Their author, Mr. Lewis Carroll was, in private life a very sober"
79,PREFACE,gentleman (at least we hope so). Nonsense is the salt of life with
80,PREFACE,which we season the dry food of everyday cooking._
81,PREFACE,
82,PREFACE,"_""A little nonsense now and then"
83,PREFACE,"Is relished by the wisest men.""_"
84,PREFACE,
85,PREFACE,_Even serious old Longfellow had this feeling in his bones when he
86,PREFACE,wrote the immortal lines which all of us recall from childhood:_
87,PREFACE,
88,PREFACE,"_""There was a little girl"
89,PREFACE,And she had a little curl
90,PREFACE,Which hung way down on her forehead;
91,PREFACE,"And when she was good,"
92,PREFACE,"She was very good indeed,"
93,PREFACE,"But when she was bad, she was horrid.""_"
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,_This is nonsense pure and simple and even the most ardent admirers of
96,PREFACE,"Mr. Longfellow must, when they try to make ""forehead"" and ""horrid"""
97,PREFACE,"rhyme, admit that it was very poor verse for the author of"
98,PREFACE,"""Evangeline.""_"
99,PREFACE,
100,PREFACE,"_Bret Harte flew off at a tangent when he wrote about ""Ah Sin, The"
101,PREFACE,"Chinaman,"" a nonsense poem that gave ""Bill Nye"" his pseudonym. Oliver"
102,PREFACE,"Wendell Holmes wrote ""The Wonderful One-Hoss Shay."" Rudyard Kipling is"
103,PREFACE,"often ""caught with the goods on him"" and Mark Twain wrote an ""Ode to"
104,PREFACE,"Stephen Dowling Botts.""_"
105,PREFACE,
106,PREFACE,"_And Great Scott! I almost forgot that even such a gentle, domestic"
107,PREFACE,creature as the cow has been the unconscious inspiration of much
108,PREFACE,nonsense and has doubtless often chewed the bitter cud of reflection in
109,PREFACE,deploring her undesired popularity. First she was forced (very much
110,PREFACE,"against her will, no doubt) to jump over the moon to the undignified"
111,PREFACE,"strains of ""Hey Diddle, Diddle."" Then, just when beginning to breathe"
112,PREFACE,"easily again after that astounding performance, Gelett Burgess came"
113,PREFACE,along and gave her more notoriety by raising the question as to whether
114,PREFACE,"there was such a thing as a ""purple cow."" And even today in many of the"
115,PREFACE,rural districts there are old farmers who never heard of Burgess and
116,PREFACE,"his ""purple cow"" who will tell you solemnly that ""there is a cow of a"
117,PREFACE,"sort of purplish color."" Which goes to prove that after all nonsense is"
118,PREFACE,only sense plus--NON._

130,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.
131,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
132,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
133,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"In days gone by, when cows could fly"
134,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And goblins rode on bears;
135,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,When fairies danced upon the green
136,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"And giants moped in lairs,"
137,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,There lived alone upon a shelf
138,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"A tinsie, winsie little elf."
139,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
140,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Just when the stars came out at night
141,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"And moonbeams filled the earth with light,"
142,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Down from his perch this little elf
143,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Would jump and wander by himself.
144,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He wore a pair of little wings
145,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Tied in their place by golden strings.
146,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
147,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,One day he took a kind of notion
148,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,To take a trip upon the ocean.
149,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He combed his hair and washed his face
150,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"And put his little wings in place,"
151,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Then from his shelf he softly stole
152,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And went to see his friend the mole
153,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Who gave to him a pea-green boat
154,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And guaranteed that it would float.
155,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
156,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,A funny thing about this boat
157,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,'Twas patterned from a ten-pound note.
158,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The little elf was greatly pleased
159,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And laughed until he sneezed and sneezed;
160,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He launched his boat upon the sea
161,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And kicked his little heels in glee.
162,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
163,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The mole looked on in glad surprise
164,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,(For in those days all moles had eyes.)
165,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He shouted out a loud farewell
166,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,As the little row-boat rose and fell.
167,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The elf picked up a golden oar
168,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And soon lost sight of mole and shore.
169,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
170,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The elf rowed out for quite a way
171,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"And in the waves did sport and play,"
172,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Until at length the sun sank low
173,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And then he thought it time to go.
174,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Now just as luck would have it then
175,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,A prowling sea gull left his den.
176,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
177,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The savage sea gull loudly laughed
178,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"To see an elf in such a craft,"
179,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And swooping down upon the water
180,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"He did a thing he hadn't oughter,"
181,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,For with his strong and sturdy beak
182,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He caused the boat to spring a leak.
183,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
184,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He said he longed for a little change
185,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And the bank-note boat was just in range;
186,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The poor young elf gave one big holler
187,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,Just as the sea gull made a swallow
188,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,(And this is strange indeed to follow
189,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,For a gull himself is just a swallow.)
190,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
191,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The faithful mole heard this loud yell
192,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And rushed down to the shore pell-mell.
193,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"Alas, alas he was too late"
194,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And saw his friend's unhappy fate;
195,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"He groaned, and shrieked and tore his fur"
196,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And raised an awful din and stir.
197,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
198,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The sea gull heard this awful racket
199,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"And seized the mole, just like a packet."
200,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,He carried him across the seas
201,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,To teach the young gulls A B C's.
202,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,But the loving mole went blind with rage
203,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,"And they had to put him in a cage,"
204,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,And ever since that fatal night
205,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,The moles have all been out of sight.
206,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
207,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
208,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
209,WHY THE MOLE IS BLIND.,
210,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.
211,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,
212,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,
213,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,"There was once an eccentric old coon,"
214,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,"Who ate dynamite with a spoon,"
215,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,But when he got loaded
216,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,The powder exploded--
217,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,And now there's a coon in the moon.
218,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,
219,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,
220,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,
221,NOW THERE'S A COON IN THE MOON.,

223,THE COUNTY FAIR.,
224,THE COUNTY FAIR.,
225,THE COUNTY FAIR.,"Oh, let's go out to the county fair"
226,THE COUNTY FAIR.,"And breathe the balmy country air,"
227,THE COUNTY FAIR.,"And whittle a stick and look at the hosses,"
228,THE COUNTY FAIR.,Discuss the farmer's profit and losses.
229,THE COUNTY FAIR.,
230,THE COUNTY FAIR.,We'll take a look at the country stock
231,THE COUNTY FAIR.,And drink some milk from a dairy crock;
232,THE COUNTY FAIR.,"Look at the pigs and admire the chickens,"
233,THE COUNTY FAIR.,And try to forget it's hot as the dickens.
234,THE COUNTY FAIR.,
235,THE COUNTY FAIR.,Forget there are any political rings
236,THE COUNTY FAIR.,Just think of the butter and eggs and things;
237,THE COUNTY FAIR.,"So wash off the buggy and hitch up the mare,"
238,THE COUNTY FAIR.,And we'll all go out to the county fair.

251,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,"And the air is full of vague commands,"
252,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,While across the street a retail grocer

254,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,"When suddenly out of the mad hubbub,"
255,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,Steps Jimmie O'Dowd of the Jefferson Club.

262,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,He brings the old plug to a halt again.
263,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,Then every man there doffs his hat
264,O'DOWD OF THE JEFFERSON CLUB.,"And cries ""Well, what do you think of that?"""

1768,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And frogs obeyed a wooden king,"
1769,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"There lived a tribe of rats so mean,"
1770,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,That such a set was never seen.
1771,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,For during all the livelong day
1772,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"They fought and quarrelled in the hay,"
1773,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And then at night they robbed the mice,"
1774,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,Who always were so kind and nice.
1775,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"They stole their bread, they stole their meat,"
1776,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And all the jam they had to eat;
1777,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"They gobbled up their pies and cake,"
1778,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And everything the mice could bake;
1779,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"They stuffed themselves with good fresh meal,"
1780,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And ruined all they could not steal;
1781,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,They slapped their long tails in the butter
1782,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,Until they made a frightful splutter;
1783,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Then, sleek and fine in coats of silk,"
1784,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,They swam about in buttermilk.
1785,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"They ate up everything they found,"
1786,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And flung the plates upon the ground.
1787,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And catching three mice by their tails,"
1788,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,They drowned them in the water-pails;
1789,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Then seeing it was morning light,"
1790,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,They scampered home with all their might.
1791,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The mouse-tribe living far and near,"
1792,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"At once this awful thing did hear,"
1793,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And all declared with cries of rage,"
1794,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,A war against the rats they'd wage.
1795,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The mouse-king blew a trumpet blast,"
1796,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And soon the mice came thick and fast
1797,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"From every place, in every manner,"
1798,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And crowded round the royal banner.
1799,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Each had a sword, a bow and arrow;"
1800,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Each felt as brave as any sparrow,"
1801,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And promised, in the coming fight,"
1802,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,To die or put the rats to flight.
1803,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The king put on a coat of mail,"
1804,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And tied a bow-knot to his tail;
1805,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"He wore a pistol by his side,"
1806,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And on a bull-frog he did ride.
1807,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"""March on!"" he cried. And, hot and thick,"
1808,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"His army rushed, in double quick."
1809,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And hardly one short hour had waned,"
1810,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Before the ranks the rat-camp gained,"
1811,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"With sounding drum and screaming fife,"
1812,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,Enough to raise the dead to life.
1813,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The rats, awakened by the clatter,"
1814,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Rushed out to see what was the matter,"
1815,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Then down the whole mouse-army flew,"
1816,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And many thieving rats it slew.
1817,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The mice hurrahed, the rats they squealed,"
1818,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And soon the dreadful battle-field
1819,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Was blue with smoke and red with fire,"
1820,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And filled with blood and savage ire.
1821,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The rats had eaten so much jam,"
1822,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"So many pies and so much ham,"
1823,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And were so fat and sick and swollen
1824,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,With all the good things they had stolen
1825,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,That they could neither fight nor run;
1826,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And so the mice the battle won.
1827,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,They threw up rat-fur in the air;
1828,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,They piled up rat-tails everywhere;
1829,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And slaughtered rats bestrewed the ground
1830,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,For ten or twenty miles around.
1831,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,The rat-king galloped from the field
1832,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,When all the rest were forced to yield;
1833,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"But though he still retained his skin,"
1834,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"He nearly fainted with chagrin,"
1835,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,To think that in that bloody tide
1836,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,So many of his rats had died.
1837,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,Fierce anger blazed within his breast;
1838,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,He would not stop to eat or rest;
1839,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"But spurring up his fiery steed,"
1840,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,He seized a sharp and trusty reed--
1841,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Then, wildly shouting, rushed like hail"
1842,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,To cut off little mouse-king's tail.
1843,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,The mouse-king's face turned red with passion
1844,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"To see a rat come in such fashion,"
1845,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,For he had just that minute said
1846,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,That every thieving rat was dead.
1847,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The rat was scared, and tried to run,"
1848,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And vowed that he was just in fun;
1849,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,But nought could quell the mouse-king's fury--
1850,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,He cared not then for judge or jury;
1851,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And with his sharp and quivering spear,"
1852,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,He pierced the rat right through the ear.
1853,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The rat fell backward in the clover,"
1854,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Kicked up his legs, and all was over."
1855,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The mice, with loud and joyful tones,"
1856,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Now gathered all the bad rats' bones,"
1857,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"And with them built a pyramid,"
1858,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,Down which their little children slid.
1859,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And after that eventful day
1860,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"The mice in peace and joy could play,"
1861,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,For now no wicked rats could steal
1862,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Their cakes and jam and pies and meal,"
1863,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,"Nor catch them by their little tails,"
1864,[1]THE WAR OF THE RATS AND MICE.,And drown them in the water-pails.
