22,HIS LIGHT,
23,HIS LIGHT,"Gray mist on the sea,"
24,HIS LIGHT,"And the night coming down,"
25,HIS LIGHT,She stays with sorrow
26,HIS LIGHT,In a far town.
27,HIS LIGHT,
28,HIS LIGHT,He goes the sea-ways
29,HIS LIGHT,"By channel lights dim,"
30,HIS LIGHT,"Her love, a true light,"
31,HIS LIGHT,Watches for him.
32,HIS LIGHT,
33,HIS LIGHT,They would be wedded
34,HIS LIGHT,"On a fair yesterday,"
35,HIS LIGHT,But the quick regiment
36,HIS LIGHT,Saw him away.
37,HIS LIGHT,
38,HIS LIGHT,Gray mist in her eyes
39,HIS LIGHT,And the night coming down:
40,HIS LIGHT,He feels a prayer
41,HIS LIGHT,From a far town.
42,HIS LIGHT,
43,HIS LIGHT,"He goes the sea-ways,"
44,HIS LIGHT,The land lights are dim;
45,HIS LIGHT,She and an altar light
46,HIS LIGHT,Keep watch for him.

51,THE COUNTERSIGN,THE COUNTERSIGN
52,THE COUNTERSIGN,
53,THE COUNTERSIGN,
54,THE COUNTERSIGN,Along Virginia's wondering roads
55,THE COUNTERSIGN,"While armies hastened on,"
56,THE COUNTERSIGN,"To Beauregard's great Southern host,"
57,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Manassas fields upon,"
58,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Came Colonel Smith's good regiment,"
59,THE COUNTERSIGN,Eager for Washington.
60,THE COUNTERSIGN,
61,THE COUNTERSIGN,But Colonel Smith must halt his men
62,THE COUNTERSIGN,"In a dangerous delay,"
63,THE COUNTERSIGN,Though well he knows the countryside
64,THE COUNTERSIGN,To the distant host of grey.
65,THE COUNTERSIGN,He cannot join with Beauregard
66,THE COUNTERSIGN,For Bull Run's bloody fray.
67,THE COUNTERSIGN,
68,THE COUNTERSIGN,"And does he halt for storm or ford,"
69,THE COUNTERSIGN,Or does he stay to dine?
70,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Say, No! but death will meet his men,"
71,THE COUNTERSIGN,Onward if moves the line:
72,THE COUNTERSIGN,"He dares not hurry to Beauregard,"
73,THE COUNTERSIGN,Not knowing the countersign.
74,THE COUNTERSIGN,
75,THE COUNTERSIGN,Flashed in the sun his waving sword;
76,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""Who rides for me?"" he cried,"
77,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""And ask of the Chief the countersign,"
78,THE COUNTERSIGN,Upon a daring ride;
79,THE COUNTERSIGN,Though never the lad come back again
80,THE COUNTERSIGN,With the good that will betide.
81,THE COUNTERSIGN,
82,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""I will send a letter to Beauregard,"""
83,THE COUNTERSIGN,The Colonel slowly said;
84,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""The bearer dies at the pickets' line,"
85,THE COUNTERSIGN,But the letter shall be read
86,THE COUNTERSIGN,"When the pickets find it for the Chief,"
87,THE COUNTERSIGN,"In the brave hand of the dead."""
88,THE COUNTERSIGN,
89,THE COUNTERSIGN,
90,THE COUNTERSIGN,
91,THE COUNTERSIGN,
92,THE COUNTERSIGN,THE COUNTERSIGN
93,THE COUNTERSIGN,
94,THE COUNTERSIGN,
95,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""Ready I ride to the Chief for the sign,"""
96,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Said little Dan O'Shea,"
97,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""Though never I come from the picket's line,"
98,THE COUNTERSIGN,But a faded suit of grey:
99,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Yet over my death will the road be safe,"
100,THE COUNTERSIGN,"And the regiment march away."""
101,THE COUNTERSIGN,
102,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""In a mother's name, I bless thee, lad,"""
103,THE COUNTERSIGN,The Colonel drew him near:
104,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""But first in the name of God,"" said Dan,"
105,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""And then is my mother's dear--"
106,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Her own good lips that taught me well,"
107,THE COUNTERSIGN,"With the Cross of Christ no fear."""
108,THE COUNTERSIGN,
109,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Quickly he rode by valley and hill,"
110,THE COUNTERSIGN,"On to the outpost line,"
111,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Till the pickets arise by wall and mound,"
112,THE COUNTERSIGN,And the levelled muskets shine;
113,THE COUNTERSIGN,"""Halt!"" they cried, ""count three to death,"
114,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Or give us the countersign."""
115,THE COUNTERSIGN,
116,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Lightly the lad leaped from his steed,"
117,THE COUNTERSIGN,"No fear was in his sigh,"
118,THE COUNTERSIGN,But a mother's face and a home he loved
119,THE COUNTERSIGN,Under an Irish sky:
120,THE COUNTERSIGN,"He made the Sign of the Cross and stood,"
121,THE COUNTERSIGN,Bravely he stood to die.
122,THE COUNTERSIGN,
123,THE COUNTERSIGN,"Lips in a prayer at the blessed Sign,"
124,THE COUNTERSIGN,"And calmly he looked around,"
125,THE COUNTERSIGN,And wonder seized his waiting soul
126,THE COUNTERSIGN,"To hear no musket sound,"
127,THE COUNTERSIGN,"But only the pickets calling to him,"
128,THE COUNTERSIGN,Heartily up the mound.
129,THE COUNTERSIGN,
130,THE COUNTERSIGN,For this was the order of Beauregard
131,THE COUNTERSIGN,Around his camp that day--
132,THE COUNTERSIGN,"The Sign of the Cross was countersign,"
133,THE COUNTERSIGN,(And a blessing to Dan O'Shea)
134,THE COUNTERSIGN,And the word came quick to Colonel Smith
135,THE COUNTERSIGN,For the muster of the grey.
136,THE COUNTERSIGN,
137,THE COUNTERSIGN,
138,THE COUNTERSIGN,
139,THE COUNTERSIGN,

141,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
142,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
143,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Turn from Kerry crossroads and leave the wooded dells,"
144,A HILL O' LIGHTS,Take the mountain path and find where Tip O'Leary dwells;
145,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Tip O'Leary is the name, I sing it all day long,"
146,A HILL O' LIGHTS,And every bird whose heart is wise will have it for a song.
147,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
148,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Tip O'Leary keeps the lights of many lamps aglow,"
149,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Little matters it to him the seasons come or go,"
150,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Sure if spring is in the air his hedges are abloom,"
151,A HILL O' LIGHTS,And fairy buds like candles shine across his garden room.
152,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
153,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Roses in the June days are light the miles around,"
154,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Tapers of the fuchsias move along the August ground,"
155,A HILL O' LIGHTS,Sumachs light the flaming torches by October's grave
156,A HILL O' LIGHTS,And like the campfires on the hills the oaks and maples wave.
157,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
158,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"All the lights but only one die out when summer goes,"
159,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"One that Tip O'Leary keeps is brighter than the rose,"
160,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Through the window comes the bloom on any winter night,"
161,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"And every sense goes wild to it, soft and sweet and bright."
162,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
163,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"Lamps are fair that have the light from flowers all day long,"
164,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"When the birds are here and sing the Tip O'Leary song,"
165,A HILL O' LIGHTS,"But a winter window is the fairest rose of all,"
166,A HILL O' LIGHTS,When Tip O'Leary's hearth is lit and lamps upon the wall.
167,A HILL O' LIGHTS,
168,A HILL O' LIGHTS,

191,OFF TO THE WAR,"Fitted the armor, plate and bands,"
192,OFF TO THE WAR,And blessed them with her tears.
193,OFF TO THE WAR,
194,OFF TO THE WAR,
195,OFF TO THE WAR,Older than Rhodes and Ascalon
196,OFF TO THE WAR,"And the farthest forts of sea,"
197,OFF TO THE WAR,Is the Master voice that calls him on
198,OFF TO THE WAR,From the hills in Galilee:
199,OFF TO THE WAR,From hills where Christ in gentle guise
200,OFF TO THE WAR,"Called, as He calls again,"
201,OFF TO THE WAR,With His heart of love and His love-lit eyes
202,OFF TO THE WAR,Unto His warrior men.

208,OFF TO THE WAR,"And whether he die in a peaceful cell,"
209,OFF TO THE WAR,"Or alone in the lonely night,"
210,OFF TO THE WAR,"The Cross of Christ shall keep him well,"
211,OFF TO THE WAR,And be his death's delight.

1290,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"And the jewels of morning light,"
1291,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Pennants of green ye fling to the air,"
1292,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,And the tall plumes waving bright.
1293,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,
1294,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Gaily away and steady ye go,"
1295,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Never a faltering line:
1296,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Forward!  I follow and try to know
1297,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Word of your countersign:
1298,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Hist!  The spies of the tyrant sun
1299,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Eagerly watch your plan,"
1300,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Lavish with bribes of gold, they run"
1301,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Down to your outmost man.
1302,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,
1303,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Steady, good lads, go bravely on"
1304,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"By the parching hills of pain,"
1305,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,An armor of shade ye soon may don
1306,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,And meet the allies of rain:
1307,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,And night in the bivouac hours will sing
1308,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Praise of the march ye made,"
1309,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"And into your pockets good gold will bring,"
1310,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Men of the Green Brigade.
1311,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,
1312,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Yea, and upon September's field,"
1313,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"When the long campaign is done,"
1314,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"With arms up-stacked, your hearts will yield"
1315,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Conquest of rain and sun:
1316,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"The pennants and plumes will then be sere,"
1317,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"Your pearls delight no morn,"
1318,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,"But tents of plenty will bless the year,"
1319,ON THE FIELD OF CORN,Brave Grenadiers of Corn.

1324,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,ALLELUIA HEIGHT
1325,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,
1326,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,
1327,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Obedience to the seasons' marshall-rod,"
1328,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"That is a law of God,"
1329,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Here beauty passes with her gorgeous train,"
1330,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,On paths that range from bud to grain.
1331,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"O, here the searching eyes"
1332,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,In traffic for the soul's good gain
1333,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Earn wealth of rare delight.
1334,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Far pathways of surprise,"
1335,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"In color's frumenty bedight,"
1336,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Lead off from avenues of day
1337,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Through miles of pageantries:
1338,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And from the starry chancels of the night
1339,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And the inscrutable farther skies,"
1340,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Beyond where trackless comets stray,"
1341,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Outspreads a world in thought's array.
1342,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And lo!  the heart's true voices sing
1343,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"From the exulting reverent breast,"
1344,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And lips proclaim, with adoration blessed,"
1345,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Glad Alleluias to the King.
1346,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,
1347,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Prompt is our praise unto a jewelled queen
1348,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"In all her courtly splendor set,"
1349,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,(Fair as those fairylands are seen
1350,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,By childhood's other sight):
1351,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"But if in pauper mien,"
1352,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Too poor for stray regret
1353,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Where crowded streets affright
1354,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"She stood in beggary,"
1355,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Unknown, though faithful to her high degree,--"
1356,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"O, then her praise  'twere easy to forget."
1357,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Yet ever here,"
1358,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,For all of time's prompt fickleness--
1359,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,From plenteous June and wide largess
1360,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Of full midsummer days,"
1361,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,To dwarf December pitiless
1362,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Amid the earth's uncomplimented ways--
1363,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Yea, constant through the changeful year,"
1364,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,This queenly Height commands our praise.
1365,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,To stand in meek unflinching hardihood
1366,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"When fortune blows its storm of fright,"
1367,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And work to full effect that good
1368,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Resolved in open days of clearer sight--
1369,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"O, this is worth!"
1370,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,That daily sees the soul
1371,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"To braver liberties give birth,"
1372,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"That heeds not time's annoy,"
1373,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And hears surrounding voices roll
1374,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Perennial circumstance of joy.
1375,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Then come not only when the springtime blows
1376,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,The old familiar strangeness of its breath
1377,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Across the long-lain snows,"
1378,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And chants her resurrected songs
1379,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,About the tombs of death;
1380,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Nor yet when summer glows
1381,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,In roseate throngs
1382,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And works her plenitude of deeds
1383,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"By tangled dells and waving meads,"
1384,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Come here in beauty's pilgrimage:
1385,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Nor when the autumn reads
1386,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Illuminate her page
1387,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,With tints of magicry besprent
1388,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Of iridescent wonderment--
1389,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"(As scrolls in old monastic towers,"
1390,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Done in an earnest far-off age).
1391,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,But choose to come in winter hours
1392,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"To see how character can live,"
1393,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,How noble character will give
1394,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Through desolate distress
1395,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And cold neglect's duress,"
1396,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,The fulness of its powers
1397,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And win the soul its victor sign.
1398,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Yea, come when in a peasant gown,"
1399,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Amid the ample banners of the pine,"
1400,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And the resounding harpers of the vine,"
1401,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Lone winter holds upon the Height
1402,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Her court in full renown.
1403,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Obedient her courtiers go,"
1404,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Their gonfalons aloft and bright,"
1405,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And scatter pearls of snow;
1406,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Her sturdy knighthood wear for crown
1407,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Prismatic sheen in young delight,"
1408,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,And wave the cedar oriflamme on high;
1409,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"While windward heralds cry,"
1410,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Across the battlements of earth
1411,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"To parapets along the sky,"
1412,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,The lauds of character's full worth.
1413,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,
1414,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,The winter passes and the days come in
1415,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Vibrant with spring.
1416,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And men find welcome at the Easter tomb,"
1417,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Reward they win,"
1418,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Who make their hearts with courage sing
1419,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Through Lenten opportunity of gloom:
1420,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"(Not as the Pharisees,"
1421,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"With faces lacrimose,"
1422,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Who wear pretence of ashen woes,"
1423,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And murmur like the tuneless bees,"
1424,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Whose honies are hypocrisies),"
1425,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"But men of character's delight,"
1426,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Who like this valiant Height
1427,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Still serving through the bleakest day,"
1428,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"With humble offerings of sound and sight,"
1429,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Do steadfast stand and pray:
1430,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"O, count those souls of noble worth,"
1431,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"And God's good pleasure on His earth,"
1432,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Who still, if joy or pain"
1433,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,"Brings sun or rain,"
1434,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,Heroic sing
1435,ALLELUIA HEIGHT,The law of Alleluia to the King.
