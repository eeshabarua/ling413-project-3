104,PREFACE,PREFACE
105,PREFACE,
106,PREFACE,THIS volume is the first compilation of the recent experiments in
107,PREFACE,Spectra. It is the aim of the Spectric group to push the possibilities
108,PREFACE,"of poetic expression into a new region,--to attain a fresh brilliance"
109,PREFACE,of impression by a method not so wholly different from the
110,PREFACE,methods of Futurist Painting.
111,PREFACE,
112,PREFACE,"An explanation of the term ""Spectric"" will indicate something of the"
113,PREFACE,"nature of the technique which it describes. ""Spectric"" has, in this"
114,PREFACE,"connection, three separate but closely related meanings. In the first"
115,PREFACE,"place, it speaks, to the mind, of that process of diffraction by"
116,PREFACE,which are disarticulated the several colored and other rays of which
117,PREFACE,light is composed. It indicates our feeling that the theme of a
118,PREFACE,"poem is to be regarded as a prism, upon which the colorless white"
119,PREFACE,"light of infinite existence falls and is broken up into glowing,"
120,PREFACE,"beautiful, and intelligible hues. In its second sense, the term"
121,PREFACE,"Spectric relates to the reflex vibrations of physical sight, and"
122,PREFACE,suggests the luminous appearance which is seen after exposure of
123,PREFACE,"the eye to intense light, and, by analogy, the after-colors of"
124,PREFACE,"the poet's initial vision. In its third sense, Spectric connotes"
125,PREFACE,"the overtones, adumbrations, or spectres which for the poet haunt"
126,PREFACE,"all objects both of the seen and the unseen world,--those"
127,PREFACE,"shadowy projections, sometimes grotesque, which, hovering around the"
128,PREFACE,"real, give to the real its full ideal significance and its poetic"
129,PREFACE,worth. These spectres are the manifold spell and true essence of
130,PREFACE,"objects,--like the magic that would inevitably encircle a mirror from"
131,PREFACE,the hand of Helen of Troy.
132,PREFACE,
133,PREFACE,"Just as the colors of the rainbow recombine into a white light,--just"
134,PREFACE,"as the reflex of the eye's picture vividly haunts sleep,--just as"
135,PREFACE,the ghosts which surround reality are the vital part of that
136,PREFACE,"existence,--so may the Spectric vision, if successful, synthesize,"
137,PREFACE,"prolong, and at the same time multiply the emotional images of"
138,PREFACE,the reader. The rays which the poet has dissociated into colorful
139,PREFACE,beauty should recombine in the reader's brain into a new intensity
140,PREFACE,of unified brilliance. The reflex of the poet's sight should sustain
141,PREFACE,the original perception with a haunting keenness. The insubstantiality
142,PREFACE,of the poet's spectres should touch with a tremulous vibrancy of
143,PREFACE,ultimate fact the reader's sense of the immediate theme.
144,PREFACE,
145,PREFACE,"If the Spectrist wishes to describe a landscape, he will not"
146,PREFACE,"attempt a map, but will put down those winged emotions, those"
147,PREFACE,"fantastic analogies, which the real scene awakens in his own mind."
148,PREFACE,In practice this will be found to be the vividest of all modes of
149,PREFACE,"communication, as the touch of hands quickens a mere exchange of names."
150,PREFACE,
151,PREFACE,"It may be noted that to Spectra, to these reflected experiences of"
152,PREFACE,"life, as we perceive them, adheres often a tinge of humor. Occidental"
153,PREFACE,"art, in contrast to art in the Orient, has until lately been afraid"
154,PREFACE,of the flash of humor in its serious works. But a growing acquaintance
155,PREFACE,with Chinese painting is surely liberating in our poets and painters
156,PREFACE,a happy sense of the disproportion of man to his assumed place in
157,PREFACE,"the universe, a sense of the tortuous grotesque vanity of the"
158,PREFACE,"individual. By this weapon, man helps defend his intuition of the"
159,PREFACE,Absolute and of his own obscure but real relation to it.
160,PREFACE,
161,PREFACE,The Spectric method is as yet in its infancy; and the poems that
162,PREFACE,follow are only experimental efforts toward the desired end. Among
163,PREFACE,"them, the most obvious illustrations of the method are perhaps _Opus"
164,PREFACE,41_ by Emanuel Morgan and _Opus 76_ by Anne Knish.
165,PREFACE,
166,PREFACE,"Emanuel Morgan, with whom the Spectric theory originated, has"
167,PREFACE,found the best expression of his genius in regular metrical forms
168,PREFACE,"and rhyme. Anne Knish, on the other hand, has used only free"
169,PREFACE,verse. We wish to make it clear that the Spectric manner does
170,PREFACE,hot necessitate the employment of either of these metrical systems
171,PREFACE,to the exclusion of the other.
172,PREFACE,
173,PREFACE,Although the members of our group would by no means attempt to
174,PREFACE,"establish a claim as actual inventors of the Spectric method,"
175,PREFACE,yet we can justifiably say that we have for the first time
176,PREFACE,"used the method consciously and consistently, and formulated"
177,PREFACE,its possibilities by means of elaborate experiment. Among
178,PREFACE,"recent poets in English, we have noted few who can be regarded"
179,PREFACE,in a sure sense as Spectrists.

1257,ANNE KNISH,"""And so I married him,"
1258,ANNE KNISH,I really wanted a merman;
1259,ANNE KNISH,And this slimy quality in him
1260,ANNE KNISH,Won me.
1261,ANNE KNISH,No one forbade the banns.
1262,ANNE KNISH,"Ergo--will you love me?"""

1269,EMANUEL MORGAN,HE not only plays
1270,EMANUEL MORGAN,One note
1271,EMANUEL MORGAN,But holds another note
1272,EMANUEL MORGAN,Away from it--
1273,EMANUEL MORGAN,As a lover
1274,EMANUEL MORGAN,Lifts
1275,EMANUEL MORGAN,A waft of hair
1276,EMANUEL MORGAN,From loved eyes.

1289,ANNE KNISH,"For long ago, in some palmed forest,"
1290,ANNE KNISH,I too felt claws curling
1291,ANNE KNISH,Within my fingers . . .
1292,ANNE KNISH,Moons wax and wane;
1293,ANNE KNISH,"My eyes, too, once narrowed and widened"
1294,ANNE KNISH,Why do you shrink back?
1295,ANNE KNISH,Come to me: let me pat you--
1296,ANNE KNISH,"Come, vast-eyed one . . ."
1297,ANNE KNISH,Or I will spring upon you
1298,ANNE KNISH,And with steel-hook fingers

1308,EMANUEL MORGAN,I AM beset by liking so many people.
1309,EMANUEL MORGAN,What can I do but hide my face away?--
1310,EMANUEL MORGAN,"Lest, looking up in love, I see no eyes or lids"
1311,EMANUEL MORGAN,"In the gleaming whirl of day,"
1312,EMANUEL MORGAN,"Lest, reaching for the fingers of love,"
1313,EMANUEL MORGAN,"I know not which are they,"
1314,EMANUEL MORGAN,"Lest the dear-lipped multitude,"
1315,EMANUEL MORGAN,"Kissing me, choke me dead!--"
1316,EMANUEL MORGAN,
1317,EMANUEL MORGAN,"O green eyes in the breakers,"
1318,EMANUEL MORGAN,"White heave unquieted,"

1328,ANNE KNISH,"Under an arch of great stones,"
1329,ANNE KNISH,"Where my eyes were sightless, groping,"
1330,ANNE KNISH,I touched this figment of clay.
1331,ANNE KNISH,
1332,ANNE KNISH,"Forgotten vase of immemorial Greece,"
1333,ANNE KNISH,Colorless form!
1334,ANNE KNISH,I have entered to the blind dark
1335,ANNE KNISH,Of the tomb where you have slept forever
1336,ANNE KNISH,And with the dreams of my importunate hands
1337,ANNE KNISH,I touch you in the profound darkness.
1338,ANNE KNISH,
1339,ANNE KNISH,You are cold and estranged;
1340,ANNE KNISH,Yet the ends of my fingers cling to your porous surface.
1341,ANNE KNISH,You are thin and very tall;
1342,ANNE KNISH,My palm can cover your mouth.
1343,ANNE KNISH,Your lip curves but a little;
1344,ANNE KNISH,Around your throat
1345,ANNE KNISH,"My two hands meet,"
1346,ANNE KNISH,And then part as I follow the swelling
1347,ANNE KNISH,"Rhythm that downward widens,"
1348,ANNE KNISH,"And I pass around and under,"
1349,ANNE KNISH,And the returning line
1350,ANNE KNISH,Ebbs home.
1351,ANNE KNISH,
1352,ANNE KNISH,Beneath your feet I touch cold marble;
1353,ANNE KNISH,My hand returns
1354,ANNE KNISH,To sleep upon your breast
1355,ANNE KNISH,Dreaming it warm.
