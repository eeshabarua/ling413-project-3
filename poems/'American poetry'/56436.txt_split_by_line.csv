224,FORT DEARBORN,Here the old Fort stood
225,FORT DEARBORN,When the river bent southward.
226,FORT DEARBORN,Now because the world pours itself into Chicago
227,FORT DEARBORN,The Lake runs into the river
228,FORT DEARBORN,"Past docks and switch-yards,"
229,FORT DEARBORN,And under bridges of iron.
230,FORT DEARBORN,
231,FORT DEARBORN,Sand dunes stretched along the lake for miles.
232,FORT DEARBORN,There was a great forest in the Loop.
233,FORT DEARBORN,Now Michigan Avenue lies
234,FORT DEARBORN,"Between miles of lights,"
235,FORT DEARBORN,And the Rialto blazes
236,FORT DEARBORN,Where the wolf howled.
237,FORT DEARBORN,
238,FORT DEARBORN,"In the loneliness of the log-cabin,"
239,FORT DEARBORN,"Across the river,"
240,FORT DEARBORN,The fur-trader played his fiddle
241,FORT DEARBORN,When the snow lay
242,FORT DEARBORN,About the camp of the Pottawatomies
243,FORT DEARBORN,In the great forest.
244,FORT DEARBORN,"Now to the music of the Kangaroo Hop,"
245,FORT DEARBORN,"And Ragging the Scale,"
246,FORT DEARBORN,"And La Seduccion,"
247,FORT DEARBORN,The boys and girls are dancing
248,FORT DEARBORN,In a cafe near Lake Street.
249,FORT DEARBORN,
250,FORT DEARBORN,The world is theirs now.
251,FORT DEARBORN,"There is neither a past nor a to-morrow,"
252,FORT DEARBORN,Save of dancing.
253,FORT DEARBORN,Nor do they know that behind them
254,FORT DEARBORN,In the seed not yet sown
255,FORT DEARBORN,"There are eyes which will open upon Chicago,"
256,FORT DEARBORN,"And feet which will blossom for the dance,"
257,FORT DEARBORN,And hands which will reach up
258,FORT DEARBORN,And push them into the silence
259,FORT DEARBORN,Of the old fiddler.
260,FORT DEARBORN,
261,FORT DEARBORN,They threw a flag
262,FORT DEARBORN,Over the coffin of Lieutenant Farnum
263,FORT DEARBORN,And buried him back of the Fort
264,FORT DEARBORN,In ground where now
265,FORT DEARBORN,The spice mills stand.
266,FORT DEARBORN,And his little squaw with a baby
267,FORT DEARBORN,Sat on the porch grieving
268,FORT DEARBORN,While the band played.
269,FORT DEARBORN,Then hands pushing the world
270,FORT DEARBORN,Buried a million soldiers and afterward
271,FORT DEARBORN,Pale multitudes swept through the Court-house
272,FORT DEARBORN,To gaze for the last time
273,FORT DEARBORN,Upon the shrunken face of Lincoln.
274,FORT DEARBORN,
275,FORT DEARBORN,And the fort at thirty-fifth street vanished.
276,FORT DEARBORN,And where the Little Giant lived
277,FORT DEARBORN,They made a park
278,FORT DEARBORN,And put his statue
279,FORT DEARBORN,Upon a column of marble.
280,FORT DEARBORN,Now the glare of the steel mills at South Chicago
281,FORT DEARBORN,Lights the bronze brow of Douglas.
282,FORT DEARBORN,It is his great sorrow
283,FORT DEARBORN,Haunting the Lake at mid-night.
284,FORT DEARBORN,
285,FORT DEARBORN,When the South was beaten
286,FORT DEARBORN,They were playing
287,FORT DEARBORN,"John Brown’s body lies mouldering in the Grave,"
288,FORT DEARBORN,And Babylon is Fallen and Wake Nicodemus.
289,FORT DEARBORN,Now the boys and girls are dancing
290,FORT DEARBORN,To the Merry Whirl and Hello Frisco
291,FORT DEARBORN,Where they waltzed in crinoline
292,FORT DEARBORN,When the Union was saved.
293,FORT DEARBORN,
294,FORT DEARBORN,There was the Marble Terrace
295,FORT DEARBORN,Glory of the seventies!
296,FORT DEARBORN,"They wrecked it,"
297,FORT DEARBORN,And brought colors and figures
298,FORT DEARBORN,From later Athens and Pompeii
299,FORT DEARBORN,And put them on walls.
300,FORT DEARBORN,"And beneath panels of red and gold,"
301,FORT DEARBORN,"And shimmering tesseræ,"
302,FORT DEARBORN,"And tragic masks and comic masks,"
303,FORT DEARBORN,"And wreaths and bucrania,"
304,FORT DEARBORN,Upon mosaic floors
305,FORT DEARBORN,Red lipped women are dancing
306,FORT DEARBORN,With dark men.
307,FORT DEARBORN,"Some sit at tables drinking and watching,"
308,FORT DEARBORN,Amorous in an air of French perfumes.
309,FORT DEARBORN,
310,FORT DEARBORN,Like ships at mid-night
311,FORT DEARBORN,The kingdoms of the world
312,FORT DEARBORN,Know not whither they go nor to what port.
313,FORT DEARBORN,"Nor do you, embryo hands,"
314,FORT DEARBORN,In the seed not yet sown
315,FORT DEARBORN,Know of the wars to come.
316,FORT DEARBORN,
317,FORT DEARBORN,They may fill the sky with armored dragons
318,FORT DEARBORN,And the waters with iron monsters;
319,FORT DEARBORN,They may build arsenals
320,FORT DEARBORN,Where now upon marble floors
321,FORT DEARBORN,The boys and girls
322,FORT DEARBORN,"Are dancing the Alabama Jubilee,"
323,FORT DEARBORN,The processional of time is a falling stream
324,FORT DEARBORN,Through which you thrust your hand.
325,FORT DEARBORN,And between the dancers and the silence forever
326,FORT DEARBORN,There shall be the livers
327,FORT DEARBORN,"Gazing upon the torches they have lighted,"
328,FORT DEARBORN,"And watching their own which are failing,"
329,FORT DEARBORN,"And crying for oil,"

342,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Abbott McNeill Whistler._)
343,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
344,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
345,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Throw logs upon the fire! Relieve the guard
346,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,At the main gate and wicket gate! Lieutenant
347,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Send two men ’round the palisades, perhaps"
348,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,They’ll find some thirsty Indians loitering
349,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Who may think there is whiskey to be had
350,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,After the wedding. Get my sealing wax!
351,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Now let me see “November, eighteen four:"
352,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Dear Jacob: On this afternoon my daughter
353,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Was married to James Abbott, it’s the first"
354,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Wedding of white people in Chicago--
355,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,That’s what we call Fort Dearborn now and then.
356,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,They left at once on horseback for Detroit.”
357,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,The “Tracy” will sail in to-morrow likely.
358,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“To Jacob Kingsbury”--that’s well addressed.
359,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Don’t fail to give this letter to the captain,"
360,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,That it may reach Detroit ere they do.
361,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,I wonder how James Abbott and my Sarah
362,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Will fare three hundred miles of sand and marsh,"
363,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And tangled forest in this hard November?
364,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,More logs upon the fire! The mist comes down!
365,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The lake roars like a wind, and not a star"
366,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Lights up the blackness. They have almost reached
367,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,The Calumet by now. Good luck James Abbott!
368,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"I’m glad my Sarah wed so brave a man,"
369,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And one so strong of arm.
370,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
371,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"It’s eighteen four,"
372,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,It’s almost eighteen five. It’s twenty years
373,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Since I was captured when Burgoyne was whipped
374,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"At Saratoga. Why, it’s almost twenty"
375,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Since I became an American soldier. Now
376,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Here am I builder of this frontier fort,"
377,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And its commander! Aged now forty-nine.
378,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"But in my time a British soldier first,"
379,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Now an American; first resident
380,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Of Ireland, then England, Maryland,"
381,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Now living here. I see the wild geese fly
382,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,To distant shores from distant shores and wonder
383,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,How they endure such strangeness. But what’s that
384,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"To man’s adventures, change of home, what’s that"
385,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,To my unsettled life? Why there’s La Salle:
386,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,They say La Salle in sixteen seventy-one
387,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Was here, and now it’s almost eighteen five."
388,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And what’s your wild geese to La Salle! He’s born
389,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"At Rouen, sails the seas, and travels over"
390,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Some several thousand miles through Canada.
391,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Is here exploring portages and rivers.
392,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Ends up at last down by the Rio Grande,"
393,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And dies almost alone half way around
394,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,The world from where he started. There’s a man!
395,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,May some one say of me: There was a man!...
396,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
397,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"I’m lonely without Sarah, without James."
398,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Tom bring my pipe and that tobacco bag.
399,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Here place my note to Jacob Kingsbury
400,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"There on the shelf--remember, to the captain"
401,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"When the “Tracy” comes. Draw, boys, up to the fire"
402,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"I’ll tell you what a wondrous dream I had,"
403,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And woke with on my Sarah’s wedding day....
404,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
405,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,I had an uncle back in Ireland
406,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Who failed at everything except his Latin.
407,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,He could spout Virgil till your head would ache.
408,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And when I was a boy he used to roll
409,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The Latin out, translating as he went:"
410,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The ghost of Hector comes before Æneas,"
411,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And warns him to leave Troy. His mother Venus
412,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Tells him to settle in another land!
413,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The Delphic oracle misunderstood,"
414,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Æneas goes to Crete. He finds at last
415,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"His ships are fired by the Trojan women,"
416,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Great conflagration! Down he goes to hell,"
417,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And then the Sibyl shows him what’s to be:
418,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"What race of heroes shall descend from him,"
419,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And how a city’s walls he shall up-build
420,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,In founding Rome....
421,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
422,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,So last night in my dream
423,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,This uncle came to me and said to me:
424,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“‘Aeneas’ Whistler you shall found a city.
425,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"You’ve built Fort Dearborn, that is the beginning."
426,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Imperial Rome could be put in a corner
427,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Of this, the city which you’ll found. Fear not"
428,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The wooden horse, but have a care for cows:"
429,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"I see ships burning on your muddy Tiber,"
430,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And toppling walls.” I dreamed I felt the heat.
431,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,But then a voice said “Where’s your little boy
432,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"George Washington?”--come sit on father’s knee,"
433,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And hear about my dream--there little boy!
434,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Well, as I said, I felt the heat and then"
435,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,I felt the cruelest cold and then the voice:
436,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"“You cannot come to Russia with your boy,"
437,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"He’ll make his way.” I woke up with these words,"
438,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And found the covers off and I was cold.
439,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And then no sooner did I fall asleep
440,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Than this old uncle re-appeared and said:
441,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"“A race of heroes shall descend from you,"
442,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Here shall a city stand greater than Rome.”
443,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"With that he seemed to alter to a witch,"
444,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"A woman’s form, the voice of him changed too,"
445,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And said: “I’m Mother Shipton, Captain Whistler."
446,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"“Men through the mountains then shall ride,"
447,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“Nor horse nor ass be by their side”--
448,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Think, gentlemen, what it would be to ride"
449,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,In carriages propelled by steam! And then
450,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,This dream became a wonder in a wonder
451,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Of populous streets, of flying things, of spires"
452,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Of driven mist that looked like fiddle strings
453,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,From tree to tree. Of smoke-stacks over-topping
454,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The tallest pine; of bridges built of levers,"
455,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And such a haze of smoke, and cloud like shapes"
456,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Passing along like etchings one by one:
457,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Cathedrals, masts as thick as hazel thickets,"
458,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And buildings great as hills, and miles of lights."
459,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Till by some miracle the sun had moved,"
460,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And rose not in the east but in the south.
461,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And shone along the shore line of the Lake,"
462,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"As he shines o’er the Lake when he arises,"
463,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And makes an avenue of gold, no less"
464,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,This yellow sand took glory of his light.
465,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And where he shone it seemed an avenue,"
466,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And over it, where now the dunes stretch south,"
467,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Along the level shore of sand, there stood"
468,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"These giant masses, etchings as it were!"
469,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And Mother Shipton said: “This is your city.
470,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“A race of heroes shall descend from you;
471,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“Your son George Washington shall do great deeds.
472,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“And if he had a son what would you name him?”
473,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Well, as I went to sleep with thoughts of Sarah"
474,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And praises for James Abbott, it was natural"
475,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,That I should say “I’d name him after James.”
476,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,“Well done” said Mother Shipton and then vanished....
477,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"I woke to find the sun-light in my room,"
478,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And from my barracks window saw the Lake
479,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Stirred up to waves slate-colored by the wind;
480,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Some Indians loitering about the fort.
481,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"They knew this was James Abbott’s wedding day,"
482,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And Sarah’s day of leaving.
483,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
484,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Soldiers! Comrades!
485,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"What is most real, our waking hours, our dreams?"
486,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Where was I in this sleep? What are our dreams
487,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"But lands which lie below our hour’s horizon,"
488,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Yet still are seen in a reflecting sky,"
489,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And which through earth and heaven draw us on?
490,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Look at me now! Consider of yourselves:
491,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Housed, fed, yet lonely, in this futile task"
492,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"By this great water, in this waste of grass,"
493,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Close to this patch of forest, on this river"
494,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Where wolves howl, and the Indian waits his chance--"
495,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Consider of your misery, your sense"
496,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Of worthless living, living to no end:"
497,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,I tell you no man lives but to some end.
498,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,He may live only to increase the mass
499,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Wherewith Fate is borne-down, or just to swell"
500,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"The needed multitude when the hero passes,"
501,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,To give the hero heart! But every man
502,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Walks, though in blindness, to some destiny"
503,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Of human growth, who only helps to fill,"
504,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And helps that way alone, the empty Fate"
505,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,That waits for lives to give it Life.
506,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,
507,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And look
508,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Here are we housed and fed, here is a fire"
509,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And here a bed. A hundred years ago
510,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Marquette, La Salle, scarce housed and poorly fed"
511,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Gave health and life itself to find the way
512,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Through icy marshes, treacherous swamps and forests"
513,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"For this Fort Dearborn, where to-night we sit"
514,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Warming ourselves against a roaring hearth.
515,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And what’s our part? It is not less than theirs.
516,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And what’s the part of those to come? Not less
517,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Than ours has been! And what’s the life of man?
518,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"To live up to the God in him, to obey"
519,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,The Voice which says: You shall not live and rest.
520,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Nor sleep, nor mad delight nor senses fed,"
521,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Nor memory dulled, nor tortured hearing stopped"
522,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,To drown my Voice shall leave you to forget
523,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Life’s impulse at the heart of Life, to strive"
524,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"For men to be, for cities, nobler states"
525,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Moving foreshadowed in your dreams at night,"
526,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And realized some hundred years to come.
527,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"When this Fort Dearborn, you and all of you,"
528,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"And I who sit with pipe and son on knee,"
529,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Regretting a dear daughter, who this hour"
530,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Is somewhere in the darkness (like our souls
531,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Which move in darkness, listening to the beat"
532,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Of our mysterious hearts, or with closed eyes"
533,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Sensing a central Purpose) shall be dust--
534,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"Our triumphs, sorrows, even our names forgotten."
535,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And all we knew lost in the wreck and waste
536,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,And change of things. And even what we did
537,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"For cities, nobler states, and greater men"
538,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Forgotten too. It matters not. We work
539,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,"For cities, nobler states and greater men,"
540,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Or else we die in Life which is the death
541,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,Which soldiers must not die!
542,CAPTAIN JOHN WHISTLER,

567,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
568,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Now Jean we are alone! Your very stillness
569,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Is like intenser life, as in your brow"
570,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Your soul was crystallized and made more strong,"
571,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"And nearer to me. You are here, I feel you."
572,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I close my eyes and feel you, you are here."
573,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Therefore a little talk before the dawn,"
574,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Which will come soon. Dawn always comes too soon
575,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,In times like this. It waits too long in times
576,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Of absence, and you will be absent soon...."
577,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
578,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I want to talk about my happiness,"
579,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"My happy life, the part you played in it."
580,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,There never was a day you did not kiss me
581,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Through nearly seventy years of married life.
582,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,I had two hours of heaven in my life.
583,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,The first one was the dance where first we met.
584,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"The other when last fall they brought me roses,"
585,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Those ninety roses for my birth-day, when"
586,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,They had me tell them of the first Chicago
587,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I saw when just a child, about the Fort;"
588,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"The cabins where the traders lived, who worked,"
589,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And made the fortune of John Jacob Astor.
590,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Poor Jean! It’s scarce a week since you were struck.
591,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"You sat down in your chair, ’twas after dinner,"
592,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Then suddenly I saw your head fall forward.
593,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,You could not speak when I went over to you.
594,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,But afterwards when you were on the bed
595,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I leaned above you and you took the ribbon,"
596,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,That hung down from my cap and pressed it trembling
597,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Against your lips. What triumph in your death!
598,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Your death was like a mass, mysterious, rich"
599,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Like Latin which the priests sing and the choir--
600,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"May angels take you and with Lazarus,"
601,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Once poor, receive you to eternal rest...."
602,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Two hours of heaven in my life that’s true!
603,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And years between that made life more than good.
604,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,My first sight of Chicago stands for all
605,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,My life became for you and all I’ve lived.
606,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"The year is 1829, you know of course."
607,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,I’ve told you of the trip in Prairie schooners
608,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"From Ft. Detroit round the lake, we camped"
609,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Along the way, the last time near the place"
610,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Where Gary and the steel mills are to-day.
611,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And the next morning what a sky! as blue
612,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"As a jay’s wing, with little rifts of snow"
613,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Along the hollows of the yellow dunes,"
614,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"And some ice in the lake, which lapped a little,"
615,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And purplish colors far off in the north.
616,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,So round these more than twenty miles we drove
617,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,That April day. And when we came as far
618,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,As thirty-ninth or thirty-first perhaps--
619,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Just sand hills then--I never can forget it--
620,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"What should I see? Fort Dearborn dazzling bright,"
621,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"All newly white-washed right against that sky,"
622,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"And the log cabins round it, far away"
623,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"The rims of forests, and between a prairie"
624,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,With wild flowers in the grasses red and blue--
625,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Such wild flowers and such grasses, such a sky,"
626,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Such oceans of sweet air, in which were rising"
627,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Straight up from Indian wigwams spires of smoke,"
628,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,About where now the Public Library stands
629,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,On Randolph Street. And as we neared the place
630,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"There was the flag, a streaming red and white"
631,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Upon a pole within the Fort’s inclosure.
632,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I cried for happiness though just a child,"
633,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And cry now thinking....
634,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
635,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,I must set this candle
636,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,To see your pale brow better! What’s the hour?
637,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"The night is passing, and I have so much"
638,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,To say to you before the dawn....
639,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
640,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Well, then"
641,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,The first hour that I call an hour of heaven:
642,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Who was that man that built the first hotel?--
643,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,It stood across the river from the Fort--
644,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,No matter. But before that I had heard
645,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Nothing beside a fiddle, living here"
646,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Amid the traders eleven years or so.
647,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And this man for his hotel’s opening
648,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Had brought an orchestra from somewhere. Think
649,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Bass viols, violins, and horns and flutes."
650,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,I’m dressed up like a princess for those days.
651,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I’m sixteen years of age and pass the door,"
652,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Enter the ball-room where such candle-light
653,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"As I had never seen shone on me, they"
654,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Bored sockets in suspended wheels of wood
655,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"And hung them from the ceiling, chandeliers!"
656,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And at that moment all the orchestra
657,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Broke into music, yes, it was a waltz!"
658,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And in that moment--what a moment-full!
659,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,This hotel man presented you and said
660,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,You were my partner for the evening. Jean
661,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I call this heaven, for its youth and love!"
662,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,I’m sixteen and you’re twenty and I love you.
663,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I slip my arm through yours for you to lead me,"
664,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"You are so strong, so ruddy, kind and brave."
665,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I want you for a husband, for a friend,"
666,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"A guide, a solace, father to the child"
667,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,That I can bear. Oh Jean how can I talk so
668,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"In this lone church at mid-night of such things,"
669,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,With all these candles burning round your face.
670,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I who have rounded ninety-years, and look"
671,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"On what was sweet, long seventy years ago?"
672,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Feeling this city even at mid-night move
673,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"In restlessness, desire, around this church,"
674,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Where once I saw the prairie grass and flowers;
675,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And saw the Indians in their colored trappings
676,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Pour from a bottle of whisky on the fire
677,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"A tribute to the Spirit of the world,"
678,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And dance and sing for madness of that Spirit?
679,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
680,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Well, Jean, my other hour. I’ve spoken before"
681,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Of our long life together glad and sad,"
682,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,But mostly good. I’m happy for it all.
683,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"This other hour is marked, I call it heaven"
684,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Just as I told you, not because they stood"
685,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Around me as a mystery from the past,"
686,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"And looked at me admiringly for my age,"
687,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"My strength in age, my life that spanned the growth"
688,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Of my Chicago from a place of huts,"
689,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Just four or five, a fort, and all around it"
690,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"A wilderness, to what it is this hour"
691,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Where most three million souls are living, nor"
692,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Because I saw this rude life, and beheld"
693,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,The World’s Fair where such richnesses of time
694,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Were spread before me--not because of these,"
695,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Nor for the ninety roses, nor the tribute"
696,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"They paid me in them, nor their gentle words--"
697,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"These did not make that hour a heaven, no--"
698,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Jean, it was this:"
699,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
700,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,First I was just as happy
701,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,As I was on that night we danced together.
702,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And that I could repeat that hour’s great bliss
703,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"At ninety years, though in a different way,"
704,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"And for a different cause, that was the thing"
705,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"That made me happy. For you see it proves,"
706,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Just give the soul a chance it’s happiness
707,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Is endless, let the body house it well,"
708,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Or house it ill, but give it but a chance"
709,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"To speak itself, not stifle it, or hush it"
710,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"With hands of flesh against the quivering strings,"
711,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Made sick or weak by time, the soul will find"
712,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Delights as good as youth has to the end.
713,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And even if the flesh be sick there’s Heine:
714,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Few men had raptures keen as his, though lying"
715,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,With death beside him through a stretch of years.
716,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"It must be something in the soul as well,"
717,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Which makes me think a third hour shall be mine
718,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"In spite of death, yes Jean it must be so!"
719,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"I want that third hour, I shall pray for it"
720,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"Unceasingly, I want it for my soul’s sake:"
721,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Which will have happiness in its very power
722,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And dignity that time nor change can hurt.
723,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,For if I have it you shall have it too.
724,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,And in that third hour we shall give each other
725,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,Something that’s kindred to the souls we gave
726,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,That night we danced together--but much more!...
727,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,
728,EMILY BROSSEAU: IN CHURCH,"It’s dawn! Good bye till then, my Jean, good bye!"

739,THE OUIJA BOARD,
740,THE OUIJA BOARD,
741,THE OUIJA BOARD,David Kennison is here born at Kingston in the year
742,THE OUIJA BOARD,"Seventeen thirty-seven and it’s nineteen sixteen now,"
743,THE OUIJA BOARD,"Dumped the tea into the harbor, saw Cornwallis’ career"
744,THE OUIJA BOARD,End at Yorktown with the sullen thunder written on his brow.
745,THE OUIJA BOARD,
746,THE OUIJA BOARD,"Was at West Point when the traitor Arnold gave up the fort,"
747,THE OUIJA BOARD,Saw them hang Major Andre for a spy and his due.
748,THE OUIJA BOARD,"Settled down in Sackett’s Harbor for a rest of a sort,"
749,THE OUIJA BOARD,Till I crossed the western country in the year forty-two.
750,THE OUIJA BOARD,
751,THE OUIJA BOARD,"And I saw Chicago rising in the ten years to come,"
752,THE OUIJA BOARD,Ere I passed in the fifties to the peace of the dead.
753,THE OUIJA BOARD,Now where is there a city in the whole of Christendom
754,THE OUIJA BOARD,Where such roar is and such walking is around a grave’s head?
755,THE OUIJA BOARD,
756,THE OUIJA BOARD,"Oh, ’twas fighting as a soldier in the wars of the land;"
757,THE OUIJA BOARD,And ’twas giving and living to make the people free
758,THE OUIJA BOARD,That kept me past a century an oak to withstand
759,THE OUIJA BOARD,The heat and snow and weevils that break down a tree.
760,THE OUIJA BOARD,
761,THE OUIJA BOARD,There were other dead around me with a slab to mark
762,THE OUIJA BOARD,When they heaped the final pillow for my honor’s meed.
763,THE OUIJA BOARD,Now the lovers stopping curiously in Lincoln Park
764,THE OUIJA BOARD,Look at the bronze tablet on my boulder and read:
765,THE OUIJA BOARD,
766,THE OUIJA BOARD,How I fought at Long Island and fought at White Plains--
767,THE OUIJA BOARD,What does it mean you lovers who scan what is scored
768,THE OUIJA BOARD,On the tablet on my boulder?--Why the task remains
769,THE OUIJA BOARD,To make the torch brighter and to keep clean the sword.
770,THE OUIJA BOARD,
771,THE OUIJA BOARD,Go labor for the future. Go make the cities great:
772,THE OUIJA BOARD,There are other realms to conquer for the men to be.
773,THE OUIJA BOARD,"For it’s toil and it’s courage that solve a soul’s fate,"

783,HANGING THE PICTURE,
784,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Before you pull that string,"
785,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And strip away that veil,"
786,HANGING THE PICTURE,I rise to enter my objection
787,HANGING THE PICTURE,To the hanging of Archer Price’s picture
788,HANGING THE PICTURE,Here in this hall....
789,HANGING THE PICTURE,For I’ll venture the artist has tried to soften
790,HANGING THE PICTURE,The vain and shifty look of the eyes;
791,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And the face that looked like a harte-beest’s,"
792,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And the rabbit mouth that looked like a horse’s,"
793,HANGING THE PICTURE,Lipping oats from a leather bag!
794,HANGING THE PICTURE,
795,HANGING THE PICTURE,I knew this man in ’28
796,HANGING THE PICTURE,"When he drifted here from Maine, he said."
797,HANGING THE PICTURE,And now it’s eighteen ninety two:
798,HANGING THE PICTURE,"This year is sacred to conquerors,"
799,HANGING THE PICTURE,Discoverers and soldiers.
800,HANGING THE PICTURE,And I object to the hanging of pictures
801,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Of men who trade while others fight,"
802,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And follow the army to get the loot,"
803,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And rest till other men are tired,"
804,HANGING THE PICTURE,Then grab the spoils while the workers sleep.
805,HANGING THE PICTURE,"I would like to burn all masks,"
806,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And padded shoes,"
807,HANGING THE PICTURE,And smash all dark lanterns.
808,HANGING THE PICTURE,And take all friends of the people
809,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And brand them with the letter “B,”"
810,HANGING THE PICTURE,Which means “Betrayer.”
811,HANGING THE PICTURE,And I would like to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
812,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Just to see the publicans who will be there,"
813,HANGING THE PICTURE,And the Archer Prices who will not be there!
814,HANGING THE PICTURE,
815,HANGING THE PICTURE,"You call him a great man,"
816,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And a prophetic man,"
817,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And a leader, and a savior,"
818,HANGING THE PICTURE,And a man who was wise in an evil world
819,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Of tangled interests and selfish power,"
820,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And who knew the art of compromise,"
821,HANGING THE PICTURE,And how to get half when you can’t get all!
822,HANGING THE PICTURE,You haven’t probed deep enough in this man.
823,HANGING THE PICTURE,For he was great as the condor is great.
824,HANGING THE PICTURE,And prophetic as the wolf is prophetic.
825,HANGING THE PICTURE,And a leader as the jackal is a leader.
826,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And his wisdom was that of the python,"
827,HANGING THE PICTURE,Which will swallow a hare when no pig is at hand!
828,HANGING THE PICTURE,
829,HANGING THE PICTURE,"He was rich,"
830,HANGING THE PICTURE,"He was well known,"
831,HANGING THE PICTURE,"His name was linked with lofty things,"
832,HANGING THE PICTURE,And adorned all noble committees.
833,HANGING THE PICTURE,And he was a friend of art and music--
834,HANGING THE PICTURE,He gave them money!
835,HANGING THE PICTURE,"He was on the Library Board,"
836,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And the Commerce Board, and every board"
837,HANGING THE PICTURE,For building up the city--
838,HANGING THE PICTURE,I admit these things. They were pawns on the board for him.
839,HANGING THE PICTURE,That’s why I rise to enter my objection
840,HANGING THE PICTURE,To hanging his picture here!
841,HANGING THE PICTURE,
842,HANGING THE PICTURE,We had no telephones in those days.
843,HANGING THE PICTURE,"But there was a certain man of power,"
844,HANGING THE PICTURE,"A man who was feared, as one might fear"
845,HANGING THE PICTURE,A lion that hides in the jungle.
846,HANGING THE PICTURE,And this man sat in a hidden room
847,HANGING THE PICTURE,As a banded-epira waits and watches.
848,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And he went from this room to his house in a cab,"
849,HANGING THE PICTURE,And back to this room in a cab.
850,HANGING THE PICTURE,But everyone knew that Archer Price
851,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Was doing the will of the man in the room,"
852,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Though you never saw the two together,"
853,HANGING THE PICTURE,As you never could see together the leaders
854,HANGING THE PICTURE,Of some of these late bi-partisan deals.
855,HANGING THE PICTURE,But Archer Price was so much alike
856,HANGING THE PICTURE,This secret man in the room;
857,HANGING THE PICTURE,And did so much what we knew
858,HANGING THE PICTURE,"He wanted done, and built the city"
859,HANGING THE PICTURE,So near to the heart’s desire of this man
860,HANGING THE PICTURE,That all of us knew that the two conferred
861,HANGING THE PICTURE,In spite of the fact that telephones
862,HANGING THE PICTURE,Had never been heard of then....
863,HANGING THE PICTURE,
864,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Well, because of this man in the room,"
865,HANGING THE PICTURE,"As well as because of Price himself,"
866,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Everyone feared him, no one knew"
867,HANGING THE PICTURE,Exactly how to fight him.
868,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Everyone hated him, although"
869,HANGING THE PICTURE,Everyone helped him to wealth and power.
870,HANGING THE PICTURE,He was what you’d call a touch-me-not.
871,HANGING THE PICTURE,If you clodded him you ran the risk
872,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Of hitting the teacher, or maybe a child."
873,HANGING THE PICTURE,He always walked with the wind to his back:
874,HANGING THE PICTURE,If you spit at him it would fly in your face.
875,HANGING THE PICTURE,And though we suspected more than we knew
876,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Of his subtle machinations,"
877,HANGING THE PICTURE,No one could attack him for what was known.
878,HANGING THE PICTURE,Because the things he was known to be doing
879,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Were service to those, who couldn’t allow"
880,HANGING THE PICTURE,The service to be imperiled.
881,HANGING THE PICTURE,
882,HANGING THE PICTURE,There never was a time
883,HANGING THE PICTURE,This man was out of public office.
884,HANGING THE PICTURE,He clung to the people’s treasury
885,HANGING THE PICTURE,As a magnet clings to a magnet.
886,HANGING THE PICTURE,Why didn’t your orator tell this audience
887,HANGING THE PICTURE,He started in life as town assessor?
888,HANGING THE PICTURE,That would have left me with nothing to say
889,HANGING THE PICTURE,Except he traded the fixing of taxes
890,HANGING THE PICTURE,For business!
891,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Oh, you people who unveil pictures!"
892,HANGING THE PICTURE,In his day no one was permitted to say this.
893,HANGING THE PICTURE,And now everyone has forgotten it.
894,HANGING THE PICTURE,It is useless to say it.
895,HANGING THE PICTURE,And here in the year of Columbus
896,HANGING THE PICTURE,You are unveiling his picture!
897,HANGING THE PICTURE,
898,HANGING THE PICTURE,And you say the Illinois and Michigan Canal
899,HANGING THE PICTURE,Had never been built or saved for the people
900,HANGING THE PICTURE,Except for Archer Price!
901,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Why don’t you tell that he fought the Canal in 1830,"
902,HANGING THE PICTURE,Saying it would burden the people?
903,HANGING THE PICTURE,And why don’t you say that even then
904,HANGING THE PICTURE,He was acting for his own interests and the man in the room?
905,HANGING THE PICTURE,Why don’t you show that his art of compromise
906,HANGING THE PICTURE,Created the Public Canal Committee
907,HANGING THE PICTURE,"When he failed to block the Canal,"
908,HANGING THE PICTURE,And failed of appointment as Canal Commissioner?
909,HANGING THE PICTURE,Why don’t you show that through that committee
910,HANGING THE PICTURE,The squatters stole the wharves on the river?
911,HANGING THE PICTURE,Why don’t you show how his friends grew rich
912,HANGING THE PICTURE,Through buying the lands at public sales
913,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Which were given to build the Canal,"
914,HANGING THE PICTURE,And which the Committee was pretending to conserve?
915,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Why don’t you show that through that Committee,"
916,HANGING THE PICTURE,"Pretending to be a friend of the people,"
917,HANGING THE PICTURE,He opened a fight at length on the squatters
918,HANGING THE PICTURE,"And won the fight, and won the wharves"
919,HANGING THE PICTURE,For himself and a clique of friends?
920,HANGING THE PICTURE,Why don’t you tell--?
921,HANGING THE PICTURE,Cry me down if you will--
922,HANGING THE PICTURE,I object--I object--

929,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES
930,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
931,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
932,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Have you ever seen the Douglas monument
933,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,There in Chicago?
934,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"They say it’s by the Lake,"
935,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"With a column of marble a hundred feet high,"
936,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And a statue of The Little Giant on top,"
937,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"With knit brows and lion face,"
938,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Like he used to look when debatin’ with Linkern.
939,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"I want to go up to Chicago sometime,"
940,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,To see that monument.
941,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
942,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And some one told me
943,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,They carved on his marble coffin the words:
944,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"“Tell my children to obey the laws,"
945,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And uphold the constitution.”
946,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Well, they couldn’t have put sadder words"
947,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,On his coffin than that.
948,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,For it was tryin’ to obey the laws and support the
949,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,constitution
950,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,That killed him.
951,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And why should his children do the same thing and die?
952,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
953,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"You young men of this day don’t care,"
954,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And you don’t understand the old questions.
955,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"But a man’s life is always worth understanding,"
956,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Especially a man’s like The Little Giant.
957,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Now this was the point:
958,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"There was that devilish thing slavery,"
959,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And The Little Giant, as senator,"
960,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Put through a bill for leaving it to the people
961,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Whether they would have slavery in Kansas or Nebraska,"
962,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Or any other territory, and that was popular sovereignty--"
963,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And sounds democratic; but three years later
964,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Along comes the Supreme Court and says:
965,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,The people of a territory must have slavery
966,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Whether they want it or not, because"
967,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"The constitution is for slavery, and it follows the flag!"
968,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Well, there was The Little Giant"
969,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Caught between the law and the constitution!
970,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And tryin’ to obey ’em both!
971,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Or better still he was like Lem Reese’s boy
972,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Who was standin’ one time one foot on shore,"
973,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And one in a skiff, baitin’ a hook,"
974,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And all at once Col. Lankford’s little steamer
975,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Came along and bobbled the skiff;
976,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And it started to glide out into the river,--"
977,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Why the boy walked like a spread compass
978,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,For a month.
979,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
980,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"For the skiff was movin’, and that’s the law."
981,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And his other foot slipped on the slimy bank,"
982,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And that’s the constitution!
983,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
984,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,But if you want to consider a minute
985,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"How Time plays tag with people,"
986,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And how no one can tell
987,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"When he’ll be It, just think:"
988,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,There was Bill McKinley
989,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Who kept the old constitution’s from goin’ to the Philippines,"
990,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And they elected him.
991,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And here was The Little Giant,"
992,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Who wanted to send it everywhere,"
993,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And they defeated him.
994,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,So you see it depends on what it means
995,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Whether you want to keep it or send it.
996,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And nobody knows what it means--
997,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Not even judges.
998,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
999,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,But just the same them were great days.
1000,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,One time The Little Giant came here with Linkern
1001,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And talked from the steps of the Court-house;
1002,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And you never saw such a crowd of people:
1003,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Democrats, Whigs, and Locofocos,"
1004,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Know-nothings and Anti-masonics,"
1005,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Blue lights, Spiritualists, Republicans"
1006,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Free Soilers, Socialists, Americans--such a crowd."
1007,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Linkern’s voice squeaked up high,"
1008,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And didn’t carry.
1009,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,But Douglas!
1010,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"People out yonder in Proctor’s Grove,"
1011,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"A mile from the Court House steps,"
1012,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Could hear him roar and hear him say:
1013,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,“I’m going to trot him down to Egypt
1014,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And see if he’ll say the things he says
1015,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,To the black republicans in northern Illinois.”
1016,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,It made you shiver all down your spine
1017,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,To see that face and hear that voice--
1018,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And that was The Little Giant!
1019,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
1020,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And then on the other hand there was
1021,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Abe Linkern standing six foot four,"
1022,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"As thin as a rail, with a high-keyed voice,"
1023,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And sometimes solemn, and sometimes comic"
1024,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"As any clown you ever saw,"
1025,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And runnin’ Col. Lankford’s little steamer,"
1026,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"As it were, you know, which would bobble the skiff,"
1027,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Which was the law; and The Little Giant’s other foot
1028,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Would slip on the bank, which was the constitution."
1029,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And you could almost hear him holler “ouch.”
1030,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And Linkern would say: This argument
1031,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Of the Senator’s is thin as soup
1032,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Made from the shadow of a starved pigeon!
1033,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And then the crowd would yell, and the cornet band"
1034,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Would play, and men would walk away and say:"
1035,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Linkern floored him. And others would say:
1036,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,He aint no match for The Little Giant.
1037,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,But I’ll declare if I could decide
1038,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Which whipped the other.
1039,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,For to let the people decide whether they wanted slavery
1040,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Sounded good.
1041,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And to have the constitution in force sounded good.
1042,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And not to have any slavery at all sounded good.
1043,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"But so far as the law was concerned,"
1044,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And where it was, and what you could do with it"
1045,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,It was like the shell game:
1046,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Now you see the little ball and now you don’t!
1047,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Who’s got a dollar to say where the little ball is?
1048,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
1049,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"But when you try to obey the laws and support the constitution,"
1050,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,It reminds me of a Campbellite preacher
1051,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,We had here years ago.
1052,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And he debated with the Methodist preacher
1053,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,As to whether immersion or sprinkling
1054,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Was the way to salvation.
1055,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And the Campbellite preacher said:
1056,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,“The holy scripture says:
1057,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,‘And Jesus when he was baptised
1058,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Went up straightway out of the water.’
1059,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And how could he come up out of the water
1060,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"If he wasn’t in?” asked the Campbellite preacher,"
1061,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Pointing a long finger at the Methodist preacher.
1062,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,“And how could he be in without being immersed?”
1063,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Well, the Campbellite preacher won the debate."
1064,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"But the next day Billy Bell,"
1065,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"An infidel we had here,"
1066,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Met the Campbellite preacher and said:
1067,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,“I suppose it wouldn’t be possible for a man
1068,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,To stand in water up to his knees
1069,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And have water sprinkled on his head, would it?”"
1070,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And the Campbellite preacher said:
1071,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"“Get thee behind me Satan,” and went on."
1072,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Well Linkern was kind of an infidel,"
1073,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And The Little Giant got caught in his own orthodoxy,"
1074,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And his ability for debate led him into
1075,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,The complete persuading of himself.
1076,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And by arguin’ for the law
1077,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,He made Linkern appear
1078,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,As bein’ against the law.
1079,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
1080,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"But just think, for a minute, young man:"
1081,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Here is The Little Giant the greatest figure in all the land
1082,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And the wheel of fortune turns
1083,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And he stands by Linkern’s side and holds
1084,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,His hat while Linkern takes the oath
1085,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,As president!
1086,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Then the war comes and his leadership
1087,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Has left him, and millions who followed him"
1088,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Turn from him, and then Death comes,"
1089,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And sits by him and says: Your time’s up!
1090,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,So I say when they put up that monument
1091,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And carved those words upon it
1092,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"They had just as well have carved the words,"
1093,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,“He took poison.”
1094,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
1095,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Which reminds me:
1096,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,There was a family over at Dutchland
1097,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Named Nitchie.
1098,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And my boy writes me from college
1099,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,That there is a writer named Nitchie
1100,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Who says--well I can’t tell you just now.
1101,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,But if you’ll look at things close
1102,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"You’ll see that Linkern was against the legal law,"
1103,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"And Douglas against the moral law so-called,"
1104,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And neither cared for the other’s law--
1105,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And that was the real debate!
1106,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Linkern rode over laws to save the Union,"
1107,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And Douglas said he cared more for white supremacy
1108,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Than anything else.
1109,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Which being true, who can tell"
1110,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Who won the debates?
1111,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,"Is it better to have the Union,"
1112,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,Or better to have a master race?
1113,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,
1114,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,I’ll go over to the post-office now
1115,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,And see if there’s a letter from my boy.
1116,THE LINCOLN AND DOUGLAS DEBATES,

1121,VII,
1122,AUTOCHTHON,AUTOCHTHON
1123,AUTOCHTHON,
1124,AUTOCHTHON,
1125,AUTOCHTHON,In a rude country some four thousand miles
1126,AUTOCHTHON,"From Charles’ and Alfred’s birthplace you were born,"
1127,AUTOCHTHON,In the same year. But Charles and you were born
1128,AUTOCHTHON,"On the same day, and Alfred six months later."
1129,AUTOCHTHON,Thus start you in a sense the race together....
1130,AUTOCHTHON,"Charles goes to Edinburgh, afterwards"
1131,AUTOCHTHON,"His father picks him for the ministry,"
1132,AUTOCHTHON,And sends him off to Cambridge where he spends
1133,AUTOCHTHON,"His time on beetles and geology,"
1134,AUTOCHTHON,Neglects theology. Alfred is here
1135,AUTOCHTHON,Fondling a Virgil and a Horace.
1136,AUTOCHTHON,"But you--these years you give to reading Æsop,"
1137,AUTOCHTHON,"The Bible, lives of Washington and Franklin,"
1138,AUTOCHTHON,And Kirkham’s grammar.
1139,AUTOCHTHON,
1140,AUTOCHTHON,In 1830 Alfred prints a book
1141,AUTOCHTHON,"Containing “Mariana,” certain other"
1142,AUTOCHTHON,"Delicate, wind-blown bells of airy music."
1143,AUTOCHTHON,And in this year you move from Indiana
1144,AUTOCHTHON,"And settle near Decatur, Illinois,"
1145,AUTOCHTHON,Hard by the river Sangamon where fever
1146,AUTOCHTHON,And ague burned and shook the poor
1147,AUTOCHTHON,Swamp saffron creatures of that desolate land.
1148,AUTOCHTHON,"While Alfred walks the flowering lanes of England,"
1149,AUTOCHTHON,And reads Theocritus to the song of larks
1150,AUTOCHTHON,"You clear the forests, plow the stumpy land,"
1151,AUTOCHTHON,"Fight off the torments of mosquitoes, flies"
1152,AUTOCHTHON,And study Kirkham’s grammar.
1153,AUTOCHTHON,
1154,AUTOCHTHON,In 1831 Charles takes a trip
1155,AUTOCHTHON,"Around the world, sees South America,"
1156,AUTOCHTHON,"And studies living things in Galapagos,"
1157,AUTOCHTHON,"Tahiti, Keeling Island and Tasmania."
1158,AUTOCHTHON,In 1831 you take a trip
1159,AUTOCHTHON,Upon a flat-boat down to New Orleans
1160,AUTOCHTHON,Through hardships scarcely less than Joliet
1161,AUTOCHTHON,"And Marquette knew in 1673,"
1162,AUTOCHTHON,Return on foot to Orfutt’s store at Salem.
1163,AUTOCHTHON,
1164,AUTOCHTHON,By this time Jacques Rousseau was canonized;
1165,AUTOCHTHON,Jefferson dead but seven years or so;
1166,AUTOCHTHON,"Brook Farm was budding, Garrison had started"
1167,AUTOCHTHON,"His _Liberator_, Fourier still alive;"
1168,AUTOCHTHON,And Emerson was preening his slim wings
1169,AUTOCHTHON,For flights into broad spaces--there was stir
1170,AUTOCHTHON,"Enough to sweep the Shelleyan heads,--in truth"
1171,AUTOCHTHON,Shelley was scarcely passed a decade then.
1172,AUTOCHTHON,"Old Godwin still was writing, wars for freedom"
1173,AUTOCHTHON,"Swept through the Grecian Isles, America"
1174,AUTOCHTHON,"Had “isms” in abundance, but not one"
1175,AUTOCHTHON,Took hold of you.
1176,AUTOCHTHON,
1177,AUTOCHTHON,In 1832 Alfred has drawn
1178,AUTOCHTHON,Out of old Mallory and Grecian myths
1179,AUTOCHTHON,"The “Lady of Shalott” and fair “Œnone,”"
1180,AUTOCHTHON,And put them into verse.
1181,AUTOCHTHON,"This is the year you fight the Black Hawk war,"
1182,AUTOCHTHON,And issue an address to Sangamon’s people.
1183,AUTOCHTHON,"You are but twenty-three, yet this address"
1184,AUTOCHTHON,"Would not shame Charles or Alfred; it’s restrained,"
1185,AUTOCHTHON,"And sanely balanced, without extra words,"
1186,AUTOCHTHON,"Or youth’s conceits, or imitative figures, dreams"
1187,AUTOCHTHON,"Or “isms” of the day. No, here you hope"
1188,AUTOCHTHON,"That enterprise, morality, sobriety"
1189,AUTOCHTHON,"May be more general, and speak a word"
1190,AUTOCHTHON,"For popular education, so that all"
1191,AUTOCHTHON,May have a “moderate education” as you say.
1192,AUTOCHTHON,"You make a plea for railroads and canals,"
1193,AUTOCHTHON,"And ask the suffrages of the people, saying"
1194,AUTOCHTHON,You have known disappointment far too much
1195,AUTOCHTHON,"To be chagrined at failure, if you lose."
1196,AUTOCHTHON,They take you at your word and send another
1197,AUTOCHTHON,To represent them in the Legislature.
1198,AUTOCHTHON,Then you decide to learn the blacksmith’s trade.
1199,AUTOCHTHON,"But Fate comes by and plucks you by the sleeve,"
1200,AUTOCHTHON,"And changes history, doubtless."
1201,AUTOCHTHON,
1202,AUTOCHTHON,By ’36 when Charles returns to England
1203,AUTOCHTHON,You have become a legislator; yes
1204,AUTOCHTHON,You tried again and won. You have become
1205,AUTOCHTHON,"A lawyer too, by working through the levels"
1206,AUTOCHTHON,"Of laborer, store-keeper and surveyor,"
1207,AUTOCHTHON,"Wrapped up in problems of geometry,"
1208,AUTOCHTHON,"And Kirkham’s grammar and Sir William Blackstone,"
1209,AUTOCHTHON,"And Coke on Littleton, and Joseph Chitty."
1210,AUTOCHTHON,"Brook Farm will soon bloom forth, Francois Fourier"
1211,AUTOCHTHON,"Is still on earth, and Garrison is shaking"
1212,AUTOCHTHON,Terrible lightning at Slavocracy.
1213,AUTOCHTHON,"And certain libertarians, _videlicet_"
1214,AUTOCHTHON,"John Greenleaf Whittier and others, sing"
1215,AUTOCHTHON,The trampling out of grapes of wrath; in truth
1216,AUTOCHTHON,The Hebrews taught the idealist how to sing
1217,AUTOCHTHON,Destruction in the name of God and curse
1218,AUTOCHTHON,Where strength was lacking for the sword--but you
1219,AUTOCHTHON,"Are not a Robert Emmet, or a Shelley,"
1220,AUTOCHTHON,Have no false dreams of dying to bring in
1221,AUTOCHTHON,The day of Liberty. At twenty-three
1222,AUTOCHTHON,You’re measuring the world and waiting for
1223,AUTOCHTHON,"Dawn’s mists to clear that you may measure it,"
1224,AUTOCHTHON,And know the field’s dimensions ere you put
1225,AUTOCHTHON,Your handle to the plow.
1226,AUTOCHTHON,
1227,AUTOCHTHON,"In 1833 a man named Hallam,"
1228,AUTOCHTHON,"A friend of Alfred’s, died at twenty-two."
1229,AUTOCHTHON,Thereafter Alfred worked his hopes and fears
1230,AUTOCHTHON,Upon the dark impasto of this loss
1231,AUTOCHTHON,In delicate colors. And in 1850
1232,AUTOCHTHON,"When you were sunk in melancholia,"
1233,AUTOCHTHON,"As one of no use in the world, adjudged"
1234,AUTOCHTHON,"To be of no use by your time and place,"
1235,AUTOCHTHON,"Alfred brought forth his Dante dream of life,"
1236,AUTOCHTHON,Received the laureate wreath and settled down
1237,AUTOCHTHON,With a fair wife amid entrancing richness
1238,AUTOCHTHON,Of sunny seas and silken sails and dreams
1239,AUTOCHTHON,"Of Araby,"
1240,AUTOCHTHON,"And ivied halls, and meadows where the breeze"
1241,AUTOCHTHON,Of temperate England blows the hurrying cloud.
1242,AUTOCHTHON,"There, seated like an Oriental king"
1243,AUTOCHTHON,In silk and linen clothed took the acclaim
1244,AUTOCHTHON,Of England and the world!...
1245,AUTOCHTHON,This is the year
1246,AUTOCHTHON,"You sit in a little office there in Springfield,"
1247,AUTOCHTHON,Feet on the desk and brood. What are you thinking?
1248,AUTOCHTHON,You’re forty-one; around you spears are whacking
1249,AUTOCHTHON,"The wind-mills of the day, you watch and weigh."
1250,AUTOCHTHON,The sun-light of your mind quivers about
1251,AUTOCHTHON,"The darkness every thinking soul must know,"
1252,AUTOCHTHON,"And lights up hidden things behind the door,"
1253,AUTOCHTHON,"And in dark corners. You have fathomed much,"
1254,AUTOCHTHON,"Weighed life and men. O what a spheréd brain,"
1255,AUTOCHTHON,"Strong nerved, fresh blooded, firm in plasmic fire,"
1256,AUTOCHTHON,"And ready for a task, if there be one!"
1257,AUTOCHTHON,That is the question that makes brooding thought:
1258,AUTOCHTHON,For you know well men come into the world
1259,AUTOCHTHON,"And find no task, and die, and are not known--"
1260,AUTOCHTHON,"Great spheréd brains gone into dust again,"
1261,AUTOCHTHON,Their light under a bushel all their days!
1262,AUTOCHTHON,"In 1859, Charles publishes"
1263,AUTOCHTHON,"His “Origin of Species,” and ’tis said"
1264,AUTOCHTHON,"You see it, or at least hear what it is."
1265,AUTOCHTHON,Out of three travelers in a distant land
1266,AUTOCHTHON,One writes a book of what the three have seen.
1267,AUTOCHTHON,"Perhaps you never read much, yet perhaps"
1268,AUTOCHTHON,Some books were just a record of your mind.
1269,AUTOCHTHON,How had it helped you in your work to read
1270,AUTOCHTHON,"The “Idylls of the King”? As much, perhaps,"
1271,AUTOCHTHON,Had Alfred read the Northwest Ordinance
1272,AUTOCHTHON,Of 1787....
1273,AUTOCHTHON,
1274,AUTOCHTHON,But in this year
1275,AUTOCHTHON,Of ’59 you’re sunk in blackest thought
1276,AUTOCHTHON,"About the country maybe, but, I think,"
1277,AUTOCHTHON,About this riddle of our mortal life.
1278,AUTOCHTHON,"You were a poet, Abraham, from your birth."
1279,AUTOCHTHON,"That makes you think, and makes you deal at last"
1280,AUTOCHTHON,With things material to the tune of laws
1281,AUTOCHTHON,Moving in higher spaces when you’re called
1282,AUTOCHTHON,To act--and show a poet moulding stuff
1283,AUTOCHTHON,Too tough for spirits practical to mould.
1284,AUTOCHTHON,Here are you with your feet upon the desk.
1285,AUTOCHTHON,You have been beaten in a cause which kept
1286,AUTOCHTHON,Some strings too loose to catch the vibrate waves
1287,AUTOCHTHON,Of a great Harp whose music you have sensed.
1288,AUTOCHTHON,You are a mathematician using symbols
1289,AUTOCHTHON,"Like Justice, Truth, with keenness to perceive"
1290,AUTOCHTHON,"Disturbance of equations, a logician"
1291,AUTOCHTHON,"Who sees invariable laws, and beauty born"
1292,AUTOCHTHON,Of finding out and following the laws.
1293,AUTOCHTHON,You are a Plato brooding there in Springfield.
1294,AUTOCHTHON,"You are a poet with a voice for Truth,"
1295,AUTOCHTHON,And never to be claimed by visionaries
1296,AUTOCHTHON,Who chant the theme of bread and bread alone.
1297,AUTOCHTHON,
1298,AUTOCHTHON,But here and now
1299,AUTOCHTHON,"They want you not for Senator, it seems."
1300,AUTOCHTHON,You have been tossed to one side by the rush
1301,AUTOCHTHON,"Of world events, left stranded and alone,"
1302,AUTOCHTHON,"And fitted for no use, it seems, in Springfield."
1303,AUTOCHTHON,"A country lawyer with a solid logic,"
1304,AUTOCHTHON,And gift of prudent phrase which has a way
1305,AUTOCHTHON,Of hardening under time to rock as hard
1306,AUTOCHTHON,As the enduring thought you seal it with.
1307,AUTOCHTHON,"You’ve reached your fiftieth year, your occultation"
1308,AUTOCHTHON,"Should pass. If ever, we should see a light:"
1309,AUTOCHTHON,In all your life you have not seen a city.
1310,AUTOCHTHON,"But now our Springfield giant strides Broadway,"
1311,AUTOCHTHON,"Thrills William Cullen Bryant, sets a wonder"
1312,AUTOCHTHON,"Going about the East, that Kirkham’s grammar"
1313,AUTOCHTHON,"Can give a man such speech at Cooper Union,"
1314,AUTOCHTHON,"Which even Alfred’s, trained to Virgil’s style,"
1315,AUTOCHTHON,Cannot disdain for matching in the thought
1316,AUTOCHTHON,With faultless clearness.
1317,AUTOCHTHON,And still in 1860 all the Brahmins
1318,AUTOCHTHON,Have fear to give you power.
1319,AUTOCHTHON,"You are a backwoodsman, a country lawyer"
1320,AUTOCHTHON,Unlettered in the difficult art of states.
1321,AUTOCHTHON,"A denizen of a squalid western town,"
1322,AUTOCHTHON,"Dowered with a knack of argument alone,"
1323,AUTOCHTHON,"Which wakes the country school-house, and may lift"
1324,AUTOCHTHON,Its devotees to Congress by good fortune.
1325,AUTOCHTHON,But then at Cooper Union intuitive eyes
1326,AUTOCHTHON,"Had measured your tall frame, and careful speech,"
1327,AUTOCHTHON,Your strength and self-possession. Then they came
1328,AUTOCHTHON,With that dramatic sense which is American
1329,AUTOCHTHON,"Into the hall with rails which you had split,"
1330,AUTOCHTHON,"And called you Honest Abe, and wearing badges"
1331,AUTOCHTHON,With your face on them and the poor catch words
1332,AUTOCHTHON,"Of Honest Abe, as if you were a referee"
1333,AUTOCHTHON,"Like Honest Kelly, when in truth no man"
1334,AUTOCHTHON,"Had ever been your intimate, ever slapped you"
1335,AUTOCHTHON,"With brisk familiarity, or called you"
1336,AUTOCHTHON,"Anything but Mr. Lincoln, never"
1337,AUTOCHTHON,"Abe, or Abraham, and never used"
1338,AUTOCHTHON,The Hello Bill of salutation to you--
1339,AUTOCHTHON,"O great patrician, therefore fit to be"
1340,AUTOCHTHON,Great democrat as well!
1341,AUTOCHTHON,
1342,AUTOCHTHON,In 1862 Charles publishes
1343,AUTOCHTHON,"“How Orchid Flowers are Fertilized by Insects,”"
1344,AUTOCHTHON,And you give forth a proclamation saying
1345,AUTOCHTHON,"“The Union must have peace, or I wipe out"
1346,AUTOCHTHON,"The blot of negro slavery. You see,"
1347,AUTOCHTHON,"The symphony’s the thing, and if you mar it,"
1348,AUTOCHTHON,"Contending over slavery, I remove"
1349,AUTOCHTHON,The source of the disharmony. I admit
1350,AUTOCHTHON,The freedom of the press--but for the Union.
1351,AUTOCHTHON,"When you abuse the Union, you shall stop."
1352,AUTOCHTHON,"And when you are in jail, no habeas corpus"
1353,AUTOCHTHON,Shall bring relief--I have suspended it.”
1354,AUTOCHTHON,To-day they call you libertarian--
1355,AUTOCHTHON,"Well, so you were, but just as Beauty is,"
1356,AUTOCHTHON,"And Truth is, even if they curb and vanquish"
1357,AUTOCHTHON,The lower heights of beauty and of truth.
1358,AUTOCHTHON,They take your speech and deeds and give you place
1359,AUTOCHTHON,"In Hebrew temples with Ezekiel,"
1360,AUTOCHTHON,Habakkuk and Isaiah--you emerge
1361,AUTOCHTHON,"From this association, master man!"
1362,AUTOCHTHON,You are not of the faith that breeds the ethic
1363,AUTOCHTHON,"Wranglers, who make economic goals"
1364,AUTOCHTHON,"The strain and test of life. You are not one,"
1365,AUTOCHTHON,"Spite of your lash and sword threat, who believe"
1366,AUTOCHTHON,God will avenge the weak. That is the dream
1367,AUTOCHTHON,Which builds millenniums where disharmonies
1368,AUTOCHTHON,That make the larger harmony shall cease--
1369,AUTOCHTHON,A dream not yours. And they shall lose you who
1370,AUTOCHTHON,Enthrone you as a prophet who cut through
1371,AUTOCHTHON,The circle of our human sphere of life
1372,AUTOCHTHON,"To let in wrath and judgments, final tests"
1373,AUTOCHTHON,"On Life around the price of sparrows, weights"
1374,AUTOCHTHON,Wherewith bread shall be weighed....
1375,AUTOCHTHON,
1376,AUTOCHTHON,"There is a windless flame where cries and tears,"
1377,AUTOCHTHON,"Where hunger, strife, and war and human blood"
1378,AUTOCHTHON,"No shadow cast, and where the love of Truth,"
1379,AUTOCHTHON,"Which is not love of individual souls,"
1380,AUTOCHTHON,Finds solace in a Judgment of our life.
1381,AUTOCHTHON,That is the Flame that took both Charles and You--
1382,AUTOCHTHON,O leader in a Commonwealth of Thought!

1423,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"The fort becomes a town within a year,"
1424,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,A great metropolis in half a cycle.
1425,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1426,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Within a lifetime you have gained
1427,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Some seven million souls.
1428,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,The land of Luther sends a swarming host;
1429,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And Milton’s land adventurous sons;
1430,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"And Scandinavia’s realm,"
1431,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"And Michael Angelo’s mountains,"
1432,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,All Europe pours her wealth
1433,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Of brawn and spirit on you,"
1434,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Until you are an empire
1435,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Of restless vital men, and teeming towns."
1436,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1437,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Before you were grown rich,"
1438,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And populous
1439,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,You brightened history;
1440,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Great men came from you.
1441,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,But now that you have cities and great treasure
1442,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Where are your great ones?
1443,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,What is your genius?
1444,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,What star enwraps your eyes?
1445,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1446,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,What heights allure you?
1447,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Hermaphroditic giant, sad and drunk"
1448,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Not gay, but foolish, stuffed with new baked bread,"
1449,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Who took away your gland pituitary,"
1450,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Abandoned you to such exaggerate growth
1451,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Without increase of soul?
1452,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"You blasphemous, yet afraid,"
1453,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Licentious, yet ashamed,"
1454,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Swaggering, yet blubbering"
1455,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And boasting of your rights.
1456,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Materialist who woos the spiritual,"
1457,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Who holds aloft the cross from which you’ve sold
1458,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,The nails to junk-men.
1459,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And makes a hackle from the crown of thorns
1460,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Wherewith to hackle hemp to make a rope
1461,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,For your own hanging in the Philippines!
1462,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Who with one hand grabs off the widow’s mite,"
1463,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And with the other tosses golden coins
1464,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Into the beggar’s cup.
1465,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"The black-snake whip in one hand, in the other"
1466,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,A plentiful supply of surgeon’s tape. Oh you!
1467,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"A hard oppressor, charitably inclined,"
1468,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And keen to see and take the outward image--
1469,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Devoid of categories to reduce
1470,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Its truth and meaning.
1471,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1472,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"No seed of old world thistles should be sown here,"
1473,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Or let to fly upon this soil.
1474,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Yet dogma has been sown here
1475,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Men rise thereby who sow the seed again;
1476,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Accessory spirits keep the ground well stirred.
1477,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"It’s gold and then it’s power, but gold at last."
1478,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And for the rest what are your dominant breeds?
1479,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Smug cultures where the aggregate mind is leather
1480,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Gorged with the oil respectability
1481,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Impervious to thought.
1482,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"These pick the eunuch type as being safe,"
1483,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"American, it’s called:"
1484,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Sleek, quiet, smiling, ready servitors"
1485,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Who for the salary, and that alone,"
1486,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,(Require no bribes)
1487,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Effect the business will.
1488,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1489,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"You are a hollow thing of steel, a cauldron,"
1490,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,No monument of freedom.
1491,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"You’re lettered, it is true,"
1492,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,With many luminous truths that came to be
1493,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Through deeds of men who died for liberty.
1494,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,But inside you there is a seething compost
1495,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Of public schools, the ballot, journalism,"
1496,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Laws, jurisprudence, dogma, gold the chief"
1497,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Ingredient all stirred into a brew
1498,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Wherewith to feed yourself and keep yourself
1499,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,The thing you are!
1500,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Not wholly slave, not really free,"
1501,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Desiring vaguely to be master moral,"
1502,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"And yet too sicklied over by old truths,"
1503,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"The ballot, fear, plebian spirit, lack of mind,"
1504,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,To reach patrician levels--
1505,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Hermaphroditic giant, misty-eyed,"
1506,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Half blinded by ideals, half by greed!"
1507,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1508,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Can nothing but a war,"
1509,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,The prospect of a slaughter or the prize
1510,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Of foreign lands, shake off your lethargy,"
1511,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And make you seem as big in spirit as
1512,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,You are in body?
1513,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Would you not love the general weal improved?
1514,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Would you not love your towns made beautiful?
1515,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Your halls and courts
1516,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Reclaimed from dicers’ oaths?
1517,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Your laws made just and tuned to god-like laws?
1518,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Your weights and measures made invariable?
1519,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Is there no tonic in such hopes as these
1520,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"To rouse you, giant?"
1521,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,
1522,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,I think you are Delilah
1523,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Tricked out as Liberty for a fancy ball,"
1524,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Spiritless, provincal, shabby, dull,"
1525,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Where no ways gentle, no natural mirth prevails."
1526,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,You’ve put your Samson’s eye out; he would see.
1527,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"You’ve chained him to the grinder, he would play,"
1528,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Be wise and human, free, courageous, fair,"
1529,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,Of cleaner flesh and nobler spirit. Look
1530,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"He may pull down your bastard temple yet,"
1531,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And make you use pentelic marble for
1532,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,"Rebuilding of the Parthenon you planned,"
1533,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,And leave the misse stone thrown in a heap
1534,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,For sheep gates in the walls of Ancient Zion!
1535,GRANT AND LOGAN AND OUR TEARS,

1539,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,THE MUNICIPAL PIER
1540,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,
1541,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,
1542,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Great snail whose lofty horns are knobbed with gold;
1543,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Long javelin of red-wood lying straight
1544,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Upon the changing indigos which unfold
1545,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,In blues and chrysophrases from the gate
1546,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Of this our city sea-ward, till the gull"
1547,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Becomes a gnat where lights annihilate
1548,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The wings’ last beat! Or are you like a hull
1549,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Pompeiian red upon the Nile’s slate green?
1550,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Or are you like these clouds which fanciful
1551,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Half open eyes make giant fish serene,"
1552,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,And motionless as rifts of carbuncles
1553,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Sunk in a waste of faience sky, between"
1554,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Such terrifying turquoise? Darkness dulls
1555,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The torches of your towers struck to flame
1556,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"By sun-set, and you mass amid the hulls"
1557,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Of shadows on the water, then reclaim"
1558,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,This blackness with a thousand eyes of light!
1559,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Peiræus made with hands, which over-came"
1560,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"The waters, where no point of land gave might"
1561,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"To walls and slips, no Peiraic promontory"
1562,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Inspired our Hippodamus in his flight
1563,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Sea-ward with docks, parades, an auditory"
1564,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"For music and a dancing floor for youths,"
1565,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,But only the sea tempted. Telling the story
1566,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"That grows within the loop, its dens and booths,"
1567,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"And palaces of trade, is to omit"
1568,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The city’s lofty genius and the truths
1569,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Through which she works at best, against the wit"
1570,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Of creatures who would sell her body, take"
1571,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The money of the sale as perquisite
1572,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,For grossness in luxurious life. Awake
1573,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Themistocles of us and carve the dream
1574,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Of Burnham into stone! Along this lake
1575,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Such as no city looks on, to redeem"
1576,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Its shores from shrieks and crashes, refuse, smoke"
1577,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,His architectural vision sketched the scheme
1578,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Of harbors, islands, boulevards--he spoke"
1579,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"For these, the concourse, stadium and a tomb"
1580,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,For that dull infamy of filth whose cloak
1581,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Is law, hiding the greedy hands that doom"
1582,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,To long delay with bribery. He is gone
1583,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,These several years into the narrow room
1584,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Where beauty is no more of walk or lawn,"
1585,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Or arch or peristyle, but still he says:"
1586,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"“Work quickly into form what I have drawn,"
1587,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,And give Chicago of these middle days
1588,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The glory which it merits: To this Pier
1589,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Make wide the marble way, build new the quays"
1590,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Give to the swimmers depths made fresh and clear,"
1591,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Lay out the flowering gardens, founts and pools"
1592,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Such as Versailles knows. The river steer
1593,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Under the arches of two decked bascules.”
1594,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Look at the photographs of seventy-six,"
1595,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Whoever you are who mocks or ridicules
1596,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"This city, then imagine stones and bricks"
1597,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Which from such lowness rose, in fifty years"
1598,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,By so much grown miraculous to transfix
1599,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The future’s wonder as ours is for piers
1600,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Like this, Chicago! O ye men who wield"
1601,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Small strength or great or none, too apt at sneers"
1602,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"For men who did too little, you must yield"
1603,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Your names for judgment soon, have you done more"
1604,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,To make this city great than Marshall Field?
1605,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"While you were railing, idling, on this shore"
1606,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Hands silent, out of sight were plunged in toil."
1607,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,You woke one morning to the waters’ roar
1608,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,And saw these gilded turrets flash and spoil
1609,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,The sun-light of the spring. What have you sown
1610,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Of truth or beauty in this eager soil
1611,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"To make your living felt, your labor known?"
1612,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Sometimes I see silk banners in the sky,"
1613,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"And hear the sound of silver trumpets blown,"
1614,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,And bells high turreted. And passing by
1615,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,This firmament of rolling blue great throngs
1616,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Stream in an air of brilliant sun where I
1617,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"A century gone am of it, when my songs"
1618,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Are but a record of a day that died,"
1619,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,And saw the end of desecrating wrongs.
1620,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,How sweet bells are borne on the evening tide
1621,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,High up where heaven is flushed and the moon’s sphere
1622,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,"Looks down on temples, arches, where the wide"
1623,THE MUNICIPAL PIER,Eternal waters thunder round the Pier!

1628,GOBINEAU TO TREE,GOBINEAU TO TREE
1629,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1630,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1631,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Since our talk at Christiana I have read
1632,GOBINEAU TO TREE,All you referred me to concerning Lincoln:
1633,GOBINEAU TO TREE,His speeches and the story of the struggle
1634,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Which ended in your war, not civil really"
1635,GOBINEAU TO TREE,But waged between two nations--but no matter!
1636,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"To me whose life is closing, and whose life"
1637,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Was spent in struggle, much of misery,"
1638,GOBINEAU TO TREE,In friendship with De Tocqueville then at odds
1639,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"With him and his philosophy, who knew"
1640,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Bismarck, who saw the wars of Europe, saw"
1641,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Great men come up and fall, and systems change,"
1642,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Who probed into the Renaissance and mastered
1643,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Religions and philosophies and wrote
1644,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Concerning racial inequalities--
1645,GOBINEAU TO TREE,To me I say this crisis of your time
1646,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And country seems remote as it might be
1647,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Almost in far Australia, trivial"
1648,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"In substance and effect, or world result."
1649,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And now your letter and these documents
1650,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Concerning Douglas yield but scanty gold.
1651,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Perhaps I’ve reached an age where I cannot
1652,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Digest new matter, or resolve its worth,"
1653,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Extract its bearing and significance.
1654,GOBINEAU TO TREE,But since you ask me I am writing you
1655,GOBINEAU TO TREE,What I’ve arrived at.
1656,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1657,GOBINEAU TO TREE,From the photographs
1658,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And the descriptions of your Illinois,"
1659,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Where Lincoln spent his youth, I almost sicken:"
1660,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Small muddy rivers flanked by bottom lands
1661,GOBINEAU TO TREE,So fat of fertile stuff the grossest weeds
1662,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Thrive thriftier than in Egypt, round their roots"
1663,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Repulsive serpents crawl, the air is full"
1664,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Of loathsome insects, and along these banks"
1665,GOBINEAU TO TREE,An agued people live who have no life
1666,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Except hard toil, whose pleasures are the dance"
1667,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Where violent liquor takes the gun or knife;
1668,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Who have no inspiration save the orgy
1669,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Of the religious meeting, where the cult"
1670,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Of savage dreams is almost theirs. The towns
1671,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Places of filth, of maddening quietude;"
1672,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Streets mired with mud, board sidewalks where the men,"
1673,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Like chickens with the cholera, stand and squeak"
1674,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Foul or half-idiot things; near by the churches,"
1675,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Mere arch-ways to the grave-yard. Nothing here
1676,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Of conscious plan to lift the spirit up.
1677,GOBINEAU TO TREE,All is defeat of liberty in spite
1678,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Of certain strong men, certain splendid breeds,"
1679,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The pioneers who made your state; no beauty
1680,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Save as a soul delves in a master book.
1681,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And out of this your Lincoln came, not poor"
1682,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"As Burns was in a land of storied towers,"
1683,GOBINEAU TO TREE,But poor as a degenerate breed is poor
1684,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Sunk down in squalor.
1685,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1686,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Yet he seems a man
1687,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Of master qualities. The muddy streets,"
1688,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And melancholy of a pastoral town,"
1689,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And sights of people sick, the stifling weeds"
1690,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Which grew about him left his spirit clean,"
1691,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Save for an ache that all his youth was spent
1692,GOBINEAU TO TREE,In such surroundings.
1693,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1694,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And observe the man!
1695,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Do poverty and life among such people
1696,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Make him a libertarian? Let us see.
1697,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"At twenty years he is a centralist,"
1698,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Stands for the bank which Andrew Jackson fought,"
1699,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And lauds protection, thinks of Washington"
1700,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Much more than Springfield. That is right I say--
1701,GOBINEAU TO TREE,But call him not a democrat.
1702,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1703,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Look here!
1704,GOBINEAU TO TREE,This master book of Stephens which you sent me
1705,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Accuses Lincoln of imperial deeds,"
1706,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And breach of laws, and rightly so, in truth."
1707,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"That makes me love him, but the end he sought"
1708,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Is something else. At first that was the Union,"
1709,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Straight through it was the Union, but at last"
1710,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The strain of Christian softness always his
1711,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Which filled him full of hate for slavery
1712,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Cropped out in freedom for your negro slaves,"
1713,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Which was an act of war, and so confessed,"
1714,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Not propped by law, but only by a will."
1715,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Thus he became a man who broke all law
1716,GOBINEAU TO TREE,To have his law. He killed a million men
1717,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"For what he called the Union, what he thought"
1718,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Was truth of Christian brotherhood. I say
1719,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"He killed a million men, for it is true"
1720,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Your war had never come, had he believed"
1721,GOBINEAU TO TREE,All government must rest in men’s consent.
1722,GOBINEAU TO TREE,What have we but a soul imperial?
1723,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"A brother to me, standing for the strong,"
1724,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"For master races, blindly at the work"
1725,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Of biologic mount? The cells of him
1726,GOBINEAU TO TREE,That make him saint for radicals and dreamers
1727,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Are but somatic, but the sperm of him"
1728,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Will propagate great rulers.
1729,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1730,GOBINEAU TO TREE,See his face!
1731,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Its tragic pathos fools the idealist--
1732,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"But study it. First, then, observe the eyes,"
1733,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And tell me how within their gaze events
1734,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Or men could lose their true proportions! Here
1735,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"No visions swarm, no dreams with flashing wings"
1736,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Throw light upon them. No, they only look"
1737,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Across a boundless prairie, that is all."
1738,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And in that brow and nose we see a strength
1739,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Slow, steady, wary, cautious--why this man"
1740,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Is your conservative, perhaps your best,"
1741,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Which is one reason why he loved the Union,"
1742,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And even said at last that government
1743,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Of the people meant the Union--how absurd!--
1744,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Would perish, if it perished, clearly false!"
1745,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And if ’twere true would be the better. Read
1746,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"My Renaissance, and other books, you’ll see"
1747,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"How I’d protect the master spirits, keep"
1748,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The master races pure; how I detest
1749,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"The brotherhood of man, how I have shown"
1750,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"The falseness of these Galilean dreams,"
1751,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"These syrups strained in secret, used to drug"
1752,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The strong and make them equal with the weak.
1753,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Such things are of the mind which weaves in space,--"
1754,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"A penalty of thought. Come back to earth,"
1755,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Live close to nature. Do not sap a rose
1756,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"To nourish cabbages, and call it truth!"
1757,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1758,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Well, then, your negro’s freed! But what of that?"
1759,GOBINEAU TO TREE,You do not want him for a friend or spouse.
1760,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"I would not see him whipped, or made a bond."
1761,GOBINEAU TO TREE,But tell me what you’re thinking of who say
1762,GOBINEAU TO TREE,His freedom is a gain for liberty?
1763,GOBINEAU TO TREE,To buy men’s labor is to buy their bodies.
1764,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Your country now has entered on a course
1765,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Of buying labor, wait and see what comes!"
1766,GOBINEAU TO TREE,I see processions filing through your land.
1767,GOBINEAU TO TREE,They carry banners bearing Lincoln’s face.
1768,GOBINEAU TO TREE,And there are hordes who think the kingdom’s coming:
1769,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"As Lincoln freed the slaves, one will arise"
1770,GOBINEAU TO TREE,To free all men! The signs before the war
1771,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Are come again, portentous stars appear"
1772,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Which prophesied the war! All revolutions
1773,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Are so announced, the world is rising higher"
1774,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Through ordered revolutions, preordained!"
1775,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Well, certain men look at these mad processions"
1776,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"From well-protected windows, with a smile--"
1777,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"They are your millionaires, they think they know"
1778,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The soul of Lincoln better than the crowds
1779,GOBINEAU TO TREE,That carry banners with his picture on them.
1780,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Yes, all they have they owe to Lincoln, they"
1781,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Grew strong through Lincoln.
1782,GOBINEAU TO TREE,
1783,GOBINEAU TO TREE,But are you content
1784,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"To have your negroes free, and millionaires"
1785,GOBINEAU TO TREE,In mastership of your republic? Where
1786,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Are men to overlord your millionaires? You know
1787,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Out of the eater comes forth meat, who will"
1788,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Exhaust the strength of those whose strength was gained
1789,GOBINEAU TO TREE,From blood of boys shed on the battle field?
1790,GOBINEAU TO TREE,What can you do to have a Renaissance
1791,GOBINEAU TO TREE,That with a terrible light will drive to covert
1792,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Owls, bats, and mousing hawks, that neither know"
1793,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"What life is, whence they come, nor what they are,"
1794,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Who live by superstition, codes of slaves,"
1795,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Fear truth, are weak, and only hunger know--"
1796,GOBINEAU TO TREE,You must have such a Renaissance or die
1797,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"While slipping smugly, self sufficiently"
1798,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Along a way unvisioned, while you play"
1799,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The hypocrite as it was never played
1800,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"In any place, in any time on earth!"
1801,GOBINEAU TO TREE,These things I see. But let me in conclusion
1802,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Point to your Lincoln as a man who makes
1803,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"For power and beauty in your country, call it"
1804,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Republic if you will, the name is nothing."
1805,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"I say the vitalest force is love, not hate."
1806,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"I say that all great souls are lovers, but of what?"
1807,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Why, what great Goethe loved! Your master men"
1808,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Should learn of Goethe, hold the crowd through him."
1809,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And Lincoln was a lover, but of what?"
1810,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Well not the cesspool of the black man’s slavery.
1811,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"He loved the mathematics of high truths,"
1812,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"And heightened spirituality, that’s the reason"
1813,GOBINEAU TO TREE,"Only a man like me can know him, that’s"
1814,GOBINEAU TO TREE,The reason that your crude American thought
1815,GOBINEAU TO TREE,Misses the man.
1816,GOBINEAU TO TREE,

1820,OLD PIERY,OLD PIERY
1821,OLD PIERY,
1822,OLD PIERY,
1823,OLD PIERY,I had a paying little refinery
1824,OLD PIERY,"And all was well with me, and then"
1825,OLD PIERY,The Trust edged up to me and wiped me out.
1826,OLD PIERY,"So much for northern tariff, freedom"
1827,OLD PIERY,Of niggers and New England rule.
1828,OLD PIERY,Praise God for sponging slavery from the Slate!
1829,OLD PIERY,"Well, then I was without a cent again,"
1830,OLD PIERY,"What should I do? I wanted first a change,"
1831,OLD PIERY,"And rest in the use of other faculties,"
1832,OLD PIERY,So I went out and took a farm.
1833,OLD PIERY,One thing leads to another. I wake up one morning
1834,OLD PIERY,And find a man from Illinois
1835,OLD PIERY,Become my neighbor on the adjoining farm.
1836,OLD PIERY,"It’s your John Cogdall, once of Petersburg,"
1837,OLD PIERY,"County of Menard, in Illinois,"
1838,OLD PIERY,"Precinct Indian Point, he said to me."
1839,OLD PIERY,"We’re friends at once, and visit back and forth."
1840,OLD PIERY,Two months ago I saw upon his table
1841,OLD PIERY,A copy of the _Petersburg Observer_--
1842,OLD PIERY,John likes to hear the home-town news--
1843,OLD PIERY,I pick it up and scan it through to see
1844,OLD PIERY,What a country paper is in Illinois.
1845,OLD PIERY,"And there I read this notice of “Old Piery,”"
1846,OLD PIERY,"Real name Cordelia Stacke, dead thirty years,"
1847,OLD PIERY,Whose money in the county treasury
1848,OLD PIERY,Is to be made escheat. So here I am
1849,OLD PIERY,"Maneuvering for this money, rather shabby"
1850,OLD PIERY,If I was not so devilish poor and pressed;
1851,OLD PIERY,If letting Menard County have the prize
1852,OLD PIERY,"Would profit any one, when I can prove"
1853,OLD PIERY,"Old Piery was my great aunt,"
1854,OLD PIERY,"Her father and my grandfather brothers,"
1855,OLD PIERY,When I can prove that I’m her only heir.
1856,OLD PIERY,
1857,OLD PIERY,"Yes, but not as pure of blood."
1858,OLD PIERY,"Her father was a judge in South Carolina,"
1859,OLD PIERY,"Her mother was a belle of New Orleans,"
1860,OLD PIERY,"My father told me so. Cordelia Stacke,"
1861,OLD PIERY,"“Old Piery,” as you called her, was a story"
1862,OLD PIERY,We heard as children sitting on his knee.
1863,OLD PIERY,"I know to prove my name is Stacke,"
1864,OLD PIERY,And then because her name was Stacke
1865,OLD PIERY,"Won’t draw this money from your treasury,"
1866,OLD PIERY,But wait
1867,OLD PIERY,"Go to your vault and get that ring she wore,"
1868,OLD PIERY,Slipped from her dead hand when you found her body
1869,OLD PIERY,Dead for a week amid her rags and stuff.
1870,OLD PIERY,"Go get that ring, Mr. Treasurer of Menard,"
1871,OLD PIERY,If I don’t describe it
1872,OLD PIERY,"Down to the finest point,"
1873,OLD PIERY,Just as I heard my father say
1874,OLD PIERY,The night she disappeared she wore a ring
1875,OLD PIERY,"Of such and such, I’ll go back to my farm"
1876,OLD PIERY,In Mississippi. But I’ll do much more
1877,OLD PIERY,I’ll trace her from Columbia to Old Salem;
1878,OLD PIERY,I’ll show her crazed brain luring her along
1879,OLD PIERY,To find the spot where Lincoln kept the store
1880,OLD PIERY,Two miles from where we sit.
1881,OLD PIERY,She must have walked
1882,OLD PIERY,"Across Virginia, West Virginia,"
1883,OLD PIERY,"Ohio, Indiana, or perhaps"
1884,OLD PIERY,"She footed it through Tennessee, Kentucky."
1885,OLD PIERY,
1886,OLD PIERY,I talked this morning with your county judge.
1887,OLD PIERY,He said she came here late in ’65
1888,OLD PIERY,"Or early ’66,"
1889,OLD PIERY,"Was seen by farmers near the Salem Mill,"
1890,OLD PIERY,"A loitering, mumbling woman,"
1891,OLD PIERY,"Not old, but looking old, and aging fast"
1892,OLD PIERY,As she became a figure in your streets
1893,OLD PIERY,"And alleys with a gunny-sack on back,"
1894,OLD PIERY,"Wherein she stuffed old bottles, paper, things"
1895,OLD PIERY,She picked industriously and stored away.
1896,OLD PIERY,Would buy a bit of cold food at the baker’s.
1897,OLD PIERY,"Sometimes would sit on door steps eating cake,"
1898,OLD PIERY,"Which friendly hands had given her, then depart"
1899,OLD PIERY,"And say, “God rest your souls!” Attended mass"
1900,OLD PIERY,"On Sunday mornings, knew no one"
1901,OLD PIERY,And had no friends.
1902,OLD PIERY,"In ’69 was found incompetent,"
1903,OLD PIERY,And placed in charge of a conservator.
1904,OLD PIERY,Then as she was not dangerous went ahead
1905,OLD PIERY,"At picking rags,"
1906,OLD PIERY,Until in ’97 passed away.
1907,OLD PIERY,
1908,OLD PIERY,"Such was the life and death of a fine girl,"
1909,OLD PIERY,The daughter of a judge in South Carolina
1910,OLD PIERY,And a belle of New Orleans.
1911,OLD PIERY,"And after life at best knew life at worst,"
1912,OLD PIERY,Beginning in a southern capitol
1913,OLD PIERY,"Where she knew riches, admiration, place,"
1914,OLD PIERY,"She ended up in Petersburg, Illinois,"
1915,OLD PIERY,"A little croaking, mad but harmless waif,"
1916,OLD PIERY,A withered leaf stirred by the Lincoln storm.
1917,OLD PIERY,And here’s my guess:
1918,OLD PIERY,The fancy of her madness brought her here
1919,OLD PIERY,To see the country where
1920,OLD PIERY,"The man who was a laborer, kept a store,"
1921,OLD PIERY,"Could rise therefrom,"
1922,OLD PIERY,"And bring such desolation to the South,"
1923,OLD PIERY,"Such sorrow to herself, that is my guess."
1924,OLD PIERY,
1925,OLD PIERY,The name’s Cordelia Stacke inside this ring
1926,OLD PIERY,You tell me. She’s the same no doubt.
1927,OLD PIERY,We all lived in Columbia when the troops
1928,OLD PIERY,Of Sherman whirled upon us to the sea.
1929,OLD PIERY,"I was a year old then. We were burned out,"
1930,OLD PIERY,Lost everything.
1931,OLD PIERY,"The troops came howling, plundering,"
1932,OLD PIERY,And tossing combustible chemicals.
1933,OLD PIERY,They butchered just for sport our cattle;
1934,OLD PIERY,Split chests and cabinets with savage axes;
1935,OLD PIERY,Walked with their hob-nailed boots on our pianos;
1936,OLD PIERY,Ran bayonets through pictures;
1937,OLD PIERY,Rode horses in our parlors;
1938,OLD PIERY,Broke open trunks and safes;
1939,OLD PIERY,"Searched cellars, opened graves for hoarded gold,"
1940,OLD PIERY,And yelled “You dirty rebels now we’ve got you.”
1941,OLD PIERY,"They filled their bellies up with wine and whisky,"
1942,OLD PIERY,"And drunken, howling through Columbia’s streets"
1943,OLD PIERY,"They carried vases, goblets, silver, gold,"
1944,OLD PIERY,"And rolled about with pockets full of loot,"
1945,OLD PIERY,And then at last they stuck the torch to us
1946,OLD PIERY,And made a bon-fire of our city.
1947,OLD PIERY,
1948,OLD PIERY,Cordelia had a lover who was killed
1949,OLD PIERY,"At Antietam fighting, not for niggers,"
1950,OLD PIERY,But fighting back the fools who had been crazed
1951,OLD PIERY,"By preachers, poets, Garrisons and Whittiers"
1952,OLD PIERY,"Who thought they worked for freedom, but instead"
1953,OLD PIERY,Worked for New England’s tariff--look at me
1954,OLD PIERY,How could the trust destroy me if the tariff
1955,OLD PIERY,Put no bricks in the bully’s boxing gloves?
1956,OLD PIERY,"Well, then, Cordelia lost her lover,"
1957,OLD PIERY,And when the troops came was a novitiate
1958,OLD PIERY,Nun at the convent. And the soldiers came
1959,OLD PIERY,To say the convent would be spared. But when
1960,OLD PIERY,"The flames arose, she ran into the city"
1961,OLD PIERY,To be beside her father and her mother.
1962,OLD PIERY,And she arrived
1963,OLD PIERY,Just as the soldiers entered the house for loot.
1964,OLD PIERY,"Her mother was in bed half dead from fright,"
1965,OLD PIERY,Not well at best.
1966,OLD PIERY,"The soldiers broke the bedroom door,"
1967,OLD PIERY,And howled for treasure. When the mother said
1968,OLD PIERY,"There was no treasure, then they took her"
1969,OLD PIERY,"And flung her from the bed, ripped up the matress,"
1970,OLD PIERY,"Raked pictures from the walls, and smashed the mirrors,"
1971,OLD PIERY,"Tore closets open, then went to the cellar"
1972,OLD PIERY,"Leaving the mother lying on the floor,"
1973,OLD PIERY,Who lay as dead.
1974,OLD PIERY,"They drank what wine they found,"
1975,OLD PIERY,"Then seized the father, hung him to a tree"
1976,OLD PIERY,To make him tell where he kept money hidden.
1977,OLD PIERY,The mother died in two days from the fright.
1978,OLD PIERY,"The father was not killed, they took him down,"
1979,OLD PIERY,"And went their way carousing, yelling out"
1980,OLD PIERY,“You dirty rebels now we’ve got you fair.”
1981,OLD PIERY,Cordelia thought no doubt that both were dead.
1982,OLD PIERY,A passerby beheld her on the lawn
1983,OLD PIERY,Her hair let down and plucking at her dress.
1984,OLD PIERY,But who could stop to help her in that hell
1985,OLD PIERY,"Of a city burning and the howls and shouts,"
1986,OLD PIERY,And falling walls?
1987,OLD PIERY,Cordelia disappeared and from that night
1988,OLD PIERY,Was never seen or heard of. To his death
1989,OLD PIERY,Her father thought she met a terrible fate:
1990,OLD PIERY,Was raped and slaughtered.
1991,OLD PIERY,
1992,OLD PIERY,So you see
1993,OLD PIERY,All of this put together tells the story
1994,OLD PIERY,Of this poor creature whom you called “Old Piery.”
1995,OLD PIERY,But let me add Cordelia had a horse
1996,OLD PIERY,She called “Old Piery”--that fits in my proof.
1997,OLD PIERY,"That’s why she named herself “Old Piery” here,"
1998,OLD PIERY,And gave your boys and girls a mocking name
1999,OLD PIERY,To hail her with as she went up your alleys;
2000,OLD PIERY,"With which to rap the windows of her room,"
2001,OLD PIERY,"Where bottles, cans, waste rags, and copper things,"
2002,OLD PIERY,"Old hoops of iron, staves, old boots and shoes,"
2003,OLD PIERY,"Springs, wheels of clocks, and locks of broken guns,"
2004,OLD PIERY,"Old boards and boxes, stacks of paper waste"
2005,OLD PIERY,"Stuffed up the place, and where unknown to all"
2006,OLD PIERY,Paper and silver money hid in cracks
2007,OLD PIERY,"Between the leaves of fouled and rain-soaked books,"
2008,OLD PIERY,Or packed in jars were kept by her. You see
2009,OLD PIERY,"Her mind was turned to treasure, hiding it"
2010,OLD PIERY,"Against the soldiers maybe, in this land"
2011,OLD PIERY,"Where Lincoln was a laborer, farmer, kept"
2012,OLD PIERY,A store at Salem.
2013,OLD PIERY,
2014,OLD PIERY,Well I say
2015,OLD PIERY,"God rest her soul, as she was used to say."
2016,OLD PIERY,"I want to raise a stone to mark her grave,"
2017,OLD PIERY,And carve her name below a broken heart.
2018,OLD PIERY,For listen now: the ring Cordelia wore
2019,OLD PIERY,Was just a little band of gold and set
2020,OLD PIERY,With a cornelian heart--am I not right?
2021,OLD PIERY,I knew I was.
2022,OLD PIERY,
2023,OLD PIERY,
2024,OLD PIERY,
2025,OLD PIERY,
2026,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?
2027,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,
2028,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,
2029,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,He calls himself an American citizen--
2030,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,And yet among such various breeds of men
2031,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Who’ll call him typical? At any rate
2032,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,His faults or virtues one may predicate
2033,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Somewhat as follows: He is sent to school
2034,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Little or much, where he imbibes the rule"
2035,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Of safety first and comfort; in his youth
2036,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,He joins the church and ends the quest of truth.
2037,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Beyond the pages of theology
2038,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"He does not turn, he does not seem to see"
2039,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,How hunger makes these Occidental creeds
2040,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Sweet foliage on which the stomach feeds.
2041,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Like those thick tussock moths upon the bole
2042,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Of a great beech tree, feed the human soul"
2043,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,And it will use the food for gold and power!
2044,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"So men have used Christ Jesus’ tender flower,"
2045,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"And garnered it for porridge, opiates,"
2046,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,And made it flesh of customs laws and states
2047,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Where life repeats itself after a plan
2048,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,And breeds the typical American--
2049,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,As he regards himself.
2050,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,
2051,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Our man matures
2052,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"And enters business, following the lures"
2053,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Of great increase in business, more receipts--"
2054,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Upon this object center all his wits.
2055,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"And greater crops make needful larger barns,"
2056,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Vainly the parable of Jesus warns.
2057,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"His soul is now required, is taken away"
2058,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"From living waters, in a little day"
2059,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Thrift, labor dooms him, leaves him banqueting"
2060,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Where nothing nourishes, they are the sting"
2061,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Which deadens him and casts him down at last
2062,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Fly blown or numb or lifeless in this vast
2063,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Surrounding air of Vital Power, where God"
2064,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Like the great sun, invites the wayside clod"
2065,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,To live at full.
2066,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,
2067,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,In time our hero weds
2068,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"A woman like himself, and little heads"
2069,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Soon run about a house or pleasant yard.
2070,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,He must work now to keep them--have regard
2071,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"To the community, its thoughts and ways."
2072,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,What church is here? He finds it best to praise
2073,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Its pastor and its flock, his children send"
2074,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"To Sunday school, if never he attend"
2075,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Its services. What politics obtain?
2076,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,He must support the tussock leaf campaigns
2077,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,If he would eat himself. ’Tis best to join
2078,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,The party which controls the greater coin.
2079,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,And so what is his party’s interest
2080,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,In business? There must his soul invest
2081,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Its treasure till the two are wholly one.
2082,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Like the poor prostitute he is undone
2083,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"In virtue not alone, but he has made"
2084,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Himself a cog-wheel in the filthy trade
2085,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Of justice courts, police and graft in wine"
2086,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Bondsmen and lawyers with a strength malign
2087,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Moving the silken vestured marionette
2088,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"To laugh, entice and play the sad coquette."
2089,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Yet if for bread you are compelled to ask
2090,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"The giver may impose an evil task,"
2091,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Or terms of life. Would you retain a roof,"
2092,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Mix with the crowd, nor dare to stand aloof."
2093,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Our hero sees this, wears a hopeful smile"
2094,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"To cover up his spattered soul, and while"
2095,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Digesting wounded truth, hiding his thought,"
2096,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"His own opinions, for his soul is caught"
2097,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Amid the idiot hands that strike and press--
2098,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"One may glide through who learns to say yes, yes,"
2099,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,While in heart-sickness whispering to himself:
2100,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"I do this for the children, and for pelf"
2101,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"To keep the house and yard, the cupboard full."
2102,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Some time I hope to free myself and pull
2103,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,My legs out of this social muck and mire.
2104,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"First money is, then freedom his desire,"
2105,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,But often neither comes. If he win wealth
2106,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"He has become lead-poisoned, for by stealth"
2107,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,The virus of the colors which he used
2108,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,To paint his life is spread and interfused
2109,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,In every vein. By ways complaisant
2110,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Our hero has got gold from ignorant
2111,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Vulgarian nondescripts, has entertained"
2112,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"The odorous cormorants, and has profaned"
2113,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,His household gods to keep them safe and whole
2114,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Upon the altar--winning what a goal!
2115,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,For meantime in this living he has schooled
2116,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,His children in the precepts which have ruled
2117,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,His days from the beginning. They are bred
2118,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"His out-look to repeat, and even to tread"
2119,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,The way he went amid the tangled wood
2120,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,In their own time and chosen neighborhood.
2121,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,What has our hero done? Why nothing more
2122,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"Than feed upon the beech leaves, gather store"
2123,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,"For children moths to feed on, and get strength"
2124,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,To climb the branches and on leaves at length
2125,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,To feed of their own will.
2126,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,
2127,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Is this a man?
2128,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,Is this your typical American?
2129,THE TYPICAL AMERICAN?,

2290,AT HAVANA,
2291,AT HAVANA,"I met a fisherman at Havana once,"
2292,AT HAVANA,"Havana on the Illinois, I mean,"
2293,AT HAVANA,There by the house and fish boats. He was burned
2294,AT HAVANA,"The color of an acorn, and his hair"
2295,AT HAVANA,Was coarse as a horse’s tail. His scraggy hands
2296,AT HAVANA,"Looked like thick bands of weather-colored copper,"
2297,AT HAVANA,But his eyes were blue as faded gingham is.
2298,AT HAVANA,"I stood amid the smell of scales and heads,"
2299,AT HAVANA,And fishes’ entrails dumped along the sand.
2300,AT HAVANA,The still air was a burning glass which focused
2301,AT HAVANA,A bon-fire sun right through my leghorn hat;
2302,AT HAVANA,And a black fly from crannies of the air
2303,AT HAVANA,Lit on my hand and bit it venomously.
2304,AT HAVANA,Across the yellow river lay the bottoms
2305,AT HAVANA,Where giant sycamores and elms o’ertopped
2306,AT HAVANA,A jungle of disgusting weeds. The breeze
2307,AT HAVANA,Hot as a tropic breath exhaled the reek
2308,AT HAVANA,"Of baking mud and of those noisome weeds,"
2309,AT HAVANA,Wherewith the odors of putrescent fish
2310,AT HAVANA,Mixed on the simmering sands. A naturalist
2311,AT HAVANA,Must seek the habitat of the life he studies....
2312,AT HAVANA,"There on a platform lay the dressed fish, carp,"
2313,AT HAVANA,"Black-bass, and pike and pickerel, buffalo,"
2314,AT HAVANA,"Cat-fish, which I had come to see, and talk"
2315,AT HAVANA,With fishermen along the Illinois.
2316,AT HAVANA,My man held up a fish and said to me;
2317,AT HAVANA,“Here is the bastard who drives all the fish
2318,AT HAVANA,"Out of the river, out of any water"
2319,AT HAVANA,"He comes in, and he comes wherever food"
2320,AT HAVANA,"Can be obtained; the black-bass, even cat-fish,"
2321,AT HAVANA,"And all the good stocks run away from him,"
2322,AT HAVANA,"He is so hoggish, plaguy, and so mean."
2323,AT HAVANA,"The other fish may try to live with him,"
2324,AT HAVANA,"I’m thinking sometimes, anyway I know"
2325,AT HAVANA,He drives the others out.” I looked to see
2326,AT HAVANA,What fish is so unfriendly to his fellows.
2327,AT HAVANA,"“Just look at him,” he said, but as he spoke"
2328,AT HAVANA,The black fly stung my hand again. When I
2329,AT HAVANA,"Looked up from swatting him, the man had thrown"
2330,AT HAVANA,"The fish upon the sand, and a stray dog"
2331,AT HAVANA,Was running off with him along the river.

2346,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,They danced at Revis Springs.

2356,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"And Greenberry Atterberry, who toed it like a pigeon"
2357,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Has gone and got religion;
2358,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"He’s deserted the dancers, the fiddlers, merry-makers,"
2359,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And I should do it too.
2360,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"For Charley, Charley has left me for to roam."
2361,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,But a woman at the mourner’s bench must tell her story true--
2362,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,What shall I do? What shall I do?
2363,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,
2364,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,My grandmother told me of Old Peter Cartwright
2365,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Who preached hell-fire
2366,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And the worm that never dies.
2367,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"And here’s a young preacher at the New Hope Meeting house,"
2368,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"And every one allows, he has old Peter’s brows,"
2369,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"And flaming of the eyes,"
2370,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"And the very same way, they say."
2371,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"Last night he stuck his finger right down in my direction,"
2372,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And said: “God doesn’t care
2373,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,For your woman’s hair.
2374,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Jesus wants to know if your soul is fair
2375,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,As your woman’s complexion.”
2376,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And then I thought he knew--
2377,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,O what shall I do?
2378,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,
2379,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"Greenberry Atterberry, weeping and unsteady"
2380,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Had left his seat already.
2381,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,He stood at the mourner’s bench in great tribulation
2382,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And told the congregation:
2383,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,That fiddling and dancing and tobacco chewin’
2384,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Led up to whisky and to woman’s ruin--
2385,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And I thought he looked at me.
2386,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"Well, you can stop dancing, and you can stop drinking"
2387,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,And you can leave the quarter-horses at the crooked races.
2388,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"But a woman, a woman, the people will be thinking"
2389,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Forever of a woman who confesses her behavior.
2390,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"And then I couldn’t look in the people’s faces,"
2391,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"All weeping and singing, O gentle Saviour!"
2392,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Then the devil said: You wench
2393,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"You’d cut a pretty figure at the mourner’s bench,"
2394,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"Go out and look for Charley,"
2395,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"Go out and look for Charley,"
2396,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,He’s down at Leese’s Grove.
2397,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,He has found a fresh love
2398,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Go win him back again.
2399,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,He is dancing on the platform to the Speckled Hen.
2400,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,
2401,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"O Saviour, Saviour, how can I join the mourners,"
2402,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Face all the scorners?
2403,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,But how can I hunt Charley at Leese’s Grove?
2404,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"How can I stand the staring, the whispering of things"
2405,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Down at Revis Springs?
2406,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,How can I stand the mocking of the fiddle strings?
2407,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,Charley! Charley!
2408,THE MOURNER’S BENCH,"So it’s knowing what’s best to do,"

2416,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2417,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2418,THE BAY-WINDOW,She sat at a bay-window where she saw
2419,THE BAY-WINDOW,First open carriages and buggies pass!
2420,THE BAY-WINDOW,And then Victorias with horses docked
2421,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And bits and buckles, chains of shining brass."
2422,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And then the horseless carriage, till at last"
2423,THE BAY-WINDOW,The swallow-gleam of varnished limousines
2424,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Silent as shadows took her lifted eye,"
2425,THE BAY-WINDOW,Uplifted from a book. She always sat
2426,THE BAY-WINDOW,"In her bay-window with a book,"
2427,THE BAY-WINDOW,And with a tinted fan in summer-time.
2428,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2429,THE BAY-WINDOW,But first she was a bride
2430,THE BAY-WINDOW,Before the war.
2431,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Springing from honest blood, her place"
2432,THE BAY-WINDOW,Passed over lightly as her grandeur grew:
2433,THE BAY-WINDOW,She was of seed too vital to decay
2434,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Wholly in any soil, the sort that grows and blooms"
2435,THE BAY-WINDOW,Where never gardener comes.
2436,THE BAY-WINDOW,And this bay-window! An aging man of gold
2437,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Had plucked her up, and here she rests and breathes"
2438,THE BAY-WINDOW,The free air of Chicago’s reclamation.
2439,THE BAY-WINDOW,And then she is
2440,THE BAY-WINDOW,"A wonder-bride for her brown hair,"
2441,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And gray-blue eyes, and laughter, sunny wit,"
2442,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And naturally patrician ways and speech,"
2443,THE BAY-WINDOW,"(Acquiring French now that the chance has come),"
2444,THE BAY-WINDOW,And she is eighteen and is born to rule.
2445,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2446,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And her great merchant husband with blue eyes,"
2447,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And strong beaked English nose,"
2448,THE BAY-WINDOW,Walks straighter for a pride that she is his.
2449,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Gives her a country place spaced out in walks,"
2450,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And flower beds, where now such flimsy flats"
2451,THE BAY-WINDOW,Confront Grand Boulevard!
2452,THE BAY-WINDOW,And for a city house he builds a house
2453,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Three stories high at Twentieth street,"
2454,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Where then the manifest was sand and oaks,"
2455,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And what is now the Loop, was just as far"
2456,THE BAY-WINDOW,As Hyde Park from the Loop is now.
2457,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2458,THE BAY-WINDOW,"In this bay-window then she sits a bride,"
2459,THE BAY-WINDOW,And sees the scrub oak cut and mansions fill
2460,THE BAY-WINDOW,Gradually year by year the waste of sand.
2461,THE BAY-WINDOW,"For fashion follows her and builds beside her,"
2462,THE BAY-WINDOW,Till Prairie Avenue becomes the street
2463,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Of millionaires, who hear from traveled wives"
2464,THE BAY-WINDOW,"What London is, what Paris is,"
2465,THE BAY-WINDOW,And open purses to unfolding tastes
2466,THE BAY-WINDOW,For canvases and sculpture.
2467,THE BAY-WINDOW,For every one grows rich now in Chicago.
2468,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And in the seventies women go to Paris,"
2469,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Herself among the first, at least the chief,"
2470,THE BAY-WINDOW,See Egypt and see Rome.
2471,THE BAY-WINDOW,And when returned drive down where wondering eyes
2472,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Along the marble terrace promenading,"
2473,THE BAY-WINDOW,Where Michigan Avenue was bounded by
2474,THE BAY-WINDOW,"The Lake across the street,"
2475,THE BAY-WINDOW,Behold the striped silk of their parasols
2476,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Fluttering over plumes and dancing eyes,"
2477,THE BAY-WINDOW,And purple velvet of Victorias.
2478,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2479,THE BAY-WINDOW,For now it is the classic age!
2480,THE BAY-WINDOW,"There is the driving park,"
2481,THE BAY-WINDOW,"There is the Palmer House,"
2482,THE BAY-WINDOW,There are cathedrals too.
2483,THE BAY-WINDOW,"There are the lofty ceilings walnut trimmed,"
2484,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And foliate chandeliers of polished brass,"
2485,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And marble-slabbed buffets with heavy cupids,"
2486,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And clustered fruits carved in their sombre wood,"
2487,THE BAY-WINDOW,And square pianos with their rosewood legs
2488,THE BAY-WINDOW,Swelled out with oval figures like great plums.
2489,THE BAY-WINDOW,And paintings deeply daubed in brown asphaltum
2490,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Where chiaroscuro ends were lost in shadows,"
2491,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Not lost in light, depressionistic things,"
2492,THE BAY-WINDOW,From which her lambent intuition led her.
2493,THE BAY-WINDOW,She was among the first to catch the psychic
2494,THE BAY-WINDOW,Waves that sweep around this little world
2495,THE BAY-WINDOW,And change all things.
2496,THE BAY-WINDOW,"She traveled much and lived in Europe much,"
2497,THE BAY-WINDOW,Returning to her window where she watched
2498,THE BAY-WINDOW,"The city pass and bow its admiration,"
2499,THE BAY-WINDOW,"The half of whom she knew as time went on,"
2500,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Though all knew her and said “there is the queen,”"
2501,THE BAY-WINDOW,Or “there she is who thinks she is the queen.”
2502,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2503,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And when the opera came she was the queen,"
2504,THE BAY-WINDOW,At least a queen whose sovereignty withstood
2505,THE BAY-WINDOW,Encroaching claims to ripen into rights.
2506,THE BAY-WINDOW,But then if all were lost where not a million
2507,THE BAY-WINDOW,"People lived as yet, and where, oh well"
2508,THE BAY-WINDOW,Packers and others threw their heavier gold
2509,THE BAY-WINDOW,"In what was once a scale of primogeniture,"
2510,THE BAY-WINDOW,Rome stood and London stood and Paris.
2511,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Have your own way at home, the mood began,"
2512,THE BAY-WINDOW,I am off here where you can scarcely come.
2513,THE BAY-WINDOW,"The next place is the best, a far off place"
2514,THE BAY-WINDOW,Has teasing witcheries to those at home.
2515,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Her husband now was dead some years, the children"
2516,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Grown up, or off to school, a daughter married"
2517,THE BAY-WINDOW,To an Italian count kept state in Florence
2518,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Where Browning came, with whom our queen would fence"
2519,THE BAY-WINDOW,In spiritual dialectics. In her travels
2520,THE BAY-WINDOW,"She had known Ibsen, Patti and George Eliot,"
2521,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Sat as a dinner guest by Beaconsfield,"
2522,THE BAY-WINDOW,And taken tea upon Hawarden’s lawn.
2523,THE BAY-WINDOW,And so in escritoires and cabinets
2524,THE BAY-WINDOW,She kept mementoes of her days abroad:
2525,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Like letters from George Eliot,"
2526,THE BAY-WINDOW,“Ferishtah’s Fancies” inscribed by Robert.
2527,THE BAY-WINDOW,And in the course of time this three-floored house
2528,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Was filled with treasures, tapestries,"
2529,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Etruscan things, and faience peacock blue;"
2530,THE BAY-WINDOW,And oriental jade with letters of gold.
2531,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And there she reigned, but lived alone"
2532,THE BAY-WINDOW,The house kept by French maids
2533,THE BAY-WINDOW,And impeccable butlers.
2534,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And so the years went, and she saw at last"
2535,THE BAY-WINDOW,The city start to slip away from her
2536,THE BAY-WINDOW,And make her royal isolation
2537,THE BAY-WINDOW,An ignorant solitude!
2538,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2539,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Yet she was beautiful at forty years,"
2540,THE BAY-WINDOW,Some years a widow then and very rich.
2541,THE BAY-WINDOW,She was most fresh and matronly at fifty.
2542,THE BAY-WINDOW,At fifty-five and sixty she could charm
2543,THE BAY-WINDOW,A man of any age. And master-men
2544,THE BAY-WINDOW,Paid suit to her and gained
2545,THE BAY-WINDOW,The stimulating richness of her mind.
2546,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Some said they did not want her, others said"
2547,THE BAY-WINDOW,Her wisdom and self-mastery froze their hearts.
2548,THE BAY-WINDOW,But when she spoke she said she could not change
2549,THE BAY-WINDOW,"The name she loved, or change her place in life"
2550,THE BAY-WINDOW,"To forced forgetfulness of that English face,"
2551,THE BAY-WINDOW,Who lifted up her life from some obscurity
2552,THE BAY-WINDOW,And made it flower.
2553,THE BAY-WINDOW,At any rate she lived for forty years
2554,THE BAY-WINDOW,With only maids and butlers in a house
2555,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Round which the warring city crept,"
2556,THE BAY-WINDOW,Until at last the street with lowered pulse
2557,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Saw vacant mansions, as the mob psychology,"
2558,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Which sways in fashion, brought an exodus."
2559,THE BAY-WINDOW,But she knew no temptation to depart.
2560,THE BAY-WINDOW,"This was her house, her center of the world."
2561,THE BAY-WINDOW,And when the Countess left the Count she came
2562,THE BAY-WINDOW,To ease her mother’s loneliness--oh yes!
2563,THE BAY-WINDOW,Six months of loneliness was quite enough.
2564,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And then in spite of everything she left,"
2565,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Returned to Florence and her rascal count,"
2566,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Because she could not stand the loneliness,"
2567,THE BAY-WINDOW,And saw ahead long years of loneliness
2568,THE BAY-WINDOW,"In some bay window--no, it could not be!"
2569,THE BAY-WINDOW,And so she left her mother sitting there
2570,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Now sixty-eight or so,"
2571,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Who watched the city pass,"
2572,THE BAY-WINDOW,"All now the swallow-gleam of limousines,"
2573,THE BAY-WINDOW,"And all around her now the boarding house,"
2574,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Or institutes for drunkards, hideous blocks"
2575,THE BAY-WINDOW,Of offices and warehouses.
2576,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2577,THE BAY-WINDOW,And all her neighbors lying up in Rose Hill.
2578,THE BAY-WINDOW,Perhaps a few remaining who remembered
2579,THE BAY-WINDOW,"All that she was, could only say to those"
2580,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Who had heard of her as she was in the eighties,"
2581,THE BAY-WINDOW,And in the nineties:
2582,THE BAY-WINDOW,"“She was a great woman, I can scarce explain."
2583,THE BAY-WINDOW,It was this way: Chicago then was young.
2584,THE BAY-WINDOW,Chicago in ten years is changed all through.
2585,THE BAY-WINDOW,You see it was this way: But then you see
2586,THE BAY-WINDOW,This great two million thing has slipped away
2587,THE BAY-WINDOW,From all our hands.”
2588,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2589,THE BAY-WINDOW,And then perhaps
2590,THE BAY-WINDOW,A limousine would pass with reckless pridelings
2591,THE BAY-WINDOW,"Coming from tea or dancing at the Blackstone,"
2592,THE BAY-WINDOW,And find their laughter shortened by her face
2593,THE BAY-WINDOW,At this bay-window
2594,THE BAY-WINDOW,Would say: “Who’s that old woman at the window?
2595,THE BAY-WINDOW,"She always has a book, or has a fan.”"
2596,THE BAY-WINDOW,
2597,THE BAY-WINDOW,

2600,MAN OF OUR STREET,MAN OF OUR STREET
2601,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2602,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2603,MAN OF OUR STREET,This Man’s life had four stages as I hear.
2604,MAN OF OUR STREET,The first stage took him through the days of school
2605,MAN OF OUR STREET,And fastened on his name a prophecy
2606,MAN OF OUR STREET,That he would win success. The second stage
2607,MAN OF OUR STREET,Took him to thirty years while he was fumbling
2608,MAN OF OUR STREET,The strings to find the key and play in key.
2609,MAN OF OUR STREET,"The third stage marked discouragement, departure"
2610,MAN OF OUR STREET,To speculations and to reconcilement
2611,MAN OF OUR STREET,That he was born no lawyer. And the fourth
2612,MAN OF OUR STREET,Was one of quietude and trivial days.
2613,MAN OF OUR STREET,I knew him in this fourth stage as a man
2614,MAN OF OUR STREET,Emerging from a house across the street
2615,MAN OF OUR STREET,"On Sunday mornings in silk hat, long coat"
2616,MAN OF OUR STREET,And bamboo cane. When summer came he donned
2617,MAN OF OUR STREET,"A flannel suit of gray, a panama"
2618,MAN OF OUR STREET,And gloves of tan. When winter came he wore
2619,MAN OF OUR STREET,A double-breasted coat with lamb’s fur collar.
2620,MAN OF OUR STREET,"He had no friends, so far as one could see,"
2621,MAN OF OUR STREET,"No membership in clubs, was never seen"
2622,MAN OF OUR STREET,"Where men meet, or society is gathered."
2623,MAN OF OUR STREET,Sometimes he stopped to tell a passer-by
2624,MAN OF OUR STREET,"The day is fine, it’s very fine, you’re right,"
2625,MAN OF OUR STREET,In voice complaisant. The neighbors knew
2626,MAN OF OUR STREET,He lived upon a little purse he made
2627,MAN OF OUR STREET,In compromise of some preposterous wrong.
2628,MAN OF OUR STREET,"And people wondered how the purse was lasting,"
2629,MAN OF OUR STREET,"And wondered how much longer he could loaf,"
2630,MAN OF OUR STREET,How many seasons more he could appear
2631,MAN OF OUR STREET,So seasonably attired and walk the streets
2632,MAN OF OUR STREET,"In such velleity, with such vacuous light"
2633,MAN OF OUR STREET,Grown steady in his eyes.
2634,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2635,MAN OF OUR STREET,I love to watch
2636,MAN OF OUR STREET,The chickens in a barn-yard. Nothing else
2637,MAN OF OUR STREET,Is quite so near the human brood. You’ll see
2638,MAN OF OUR STREET,Invariably a rooster stalk about
2639,MAN OF OUR STREET,"In aimless fashion, moving here and there,"
2640,MAN OF OUR STREET,Picking at times with dull inappetence
2641,MAN OF OUR STREET,"At grains or grit, or standing for a time"
2642,MAN OF OUR STREET,In listless revery. I never saw
2643,MAN OF OUR STREET,A man with such resemblance to this rooster
2644,MAN OF OUR STREET,As this man was.
2645,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2646,MAN OF OUR STREET,At last we had not seen
2647,MAN OF OUR STREET,Our man upon the street for several days.
2648,MAN OF OUR STREET,And some one said he had been very ill.
2649,MAN OF OUR STREET,His wife had fears and wept and said ’twas hard
2650,MAN OF OUR STREET,Just on the eve of great success to die.
2651,MAN OF OUR STREET,"He had thought out a plan, she said, to win"
2652,MAN OF OUR STREET,Great trade in South America for us.
2653,MAN OF OUR STREET,Our State Department thought it excellent.
2654,MAN OF OUR STREET,And then one day four doctors passed his door
2655,MAN OF OUR STREET,"For consultation, and the word went round"
2656,MAN OF OUR STREET,Our man rebelled most piteously and said
2657,MAN OF OUR STREET,He could not die until he had worked out
2658,MAN OF OUR STREET,His dream of South America. He knew
2659,MAN OF OUR STREET,"His danger, had the doctors called to check"
2660,MAN OF OUR STREET,"The inroads of the peril, though the purse"
2661,MAN OF OUR STREET,"Was growing slim, as we discovered later."
2662,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2663,MAN OF OUR STREET,One noon-time as I came along the street
2664,MAN OF OUR STREET,"Where twenty children laughed and followed me,"
2665,MAN OF OUR STREET,"Half playing at their game, half following"
2666,MAN OF OUR STREET,"My banterings and idle talk, and asking"
2667,MAN OF OUR STREET,About the bundle underneath my arm.
2668,MAN OF OUR STREET,"“It’s nothing but a chicken, go away,”"
2669,MAN OF OUR STREET,I said to them.
2670,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2671,MAN OF OUR STREET,And there across the street
2672,MAN OF OUR STREET,"Was crape upon the door--our man was dead,"
2673,MAN OF OUR STREET,And I was carrying chicken home to boil
2674,MAN OF OUR STREET,
2675,MAN OF OUR STREET,

2686,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,"“Achilles Deatheridge, you have done"

2691,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,“Why didn’t you know how plain he is?
2692,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,"And didn’t you ever hear,"

2694,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,Like a sooty cannoneer?”
2695,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,
2696,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,"“You must have been half dead for sleep,"

2701,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,“I cocked my gun at the swish of the grass
2702,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,And how am I at fault

2704,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,When a sentry hollers halt?”
2705,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,
2706,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,“I cried out halt and he only smiled
2707,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,And waved his hand like that.

2710,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,
2711,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,“I hollered halt again and he stopped
2712,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,And lighted a fresh cigar.
2713,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,"I never noticed his shoulder badge,"
2714,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,And I never noticed a star.”
2715,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,
2716,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,"“So you arrested him? Well, Achilles,"
2717,ACHILLES DEATHERIDGE,When you hear the swish of the grass

2728,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,A gentle idiot body.
2729,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,You are slender like a broom
2730,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"Weaving up and down the room,"
2731,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,With your dirt hair in a twist
2732,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,And your left eye in a mist.
2733,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"Never thinkin’, never hopin’"
2734,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,With your wet mouth open.
2735,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,So bewildered and so busy
2736,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"As you scrape the dirty kettles,"
2737,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,O Slip Shoe Lizzie
2738,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,As you rattle with the pans.
2739,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"There’s a clatter of old metals,"
2740,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"O Slip Shoe Lovey,"
2741,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,As you clean the milk cans.
2742,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"You’re a greasy little dovey,"
2743,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"A laughing scullery daughter,"
2744,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"As you slop the dish water,"

2747,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,
2748,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"So mussy, little hussie,"
2749,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"With the china that you break,"
2750,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,And the kitchen in a smear
2751,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"When the bread is yet to bake,"
2752,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,And the market things are here--
2753,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,O Slip Shoe Lovey!
2754,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,
2755,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,You are hurrying and scurrying
2756,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"From the sink to the oven,"
2757,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,So forgetful and so sloven.
2758,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,You are bustling and hustling
2759,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"From the pantry to the door,"
2760,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"With your shoe strings on the floor,"

2766,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"Washing dishes, beating batter."
2767,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,But there is another matter
2768,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,As you dream above the sink:
2769,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"You’re in love pitter-patter,"
2770,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,With the butcher-boy I think.
2771,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"And he’ll get you, he has got you"
2772,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,If he hasn’t got you yet.
2773,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,
2774,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"For he means to make you his,"
2775,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,O Slip Shoe Liz.
2776,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,And your open mouth is wet
2777,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,To a little boyish chatter.
2778,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,You’re an easy thing to flatter
2779,SLIP SHOE LOVEY,"With your hank of hair a-twist,"

2796,THE ARCHANGELS,Flopped on the floor
2797,THE ARCHANGELS,"With such a silken richness of dark hair,"
2798,THE ARCHANGELS,"Descending breezily like blown water from her brow,"
2799,THE ARCHANGELS,"And from the arched crown of her Raphael head,"
2800,THE ARCHANGELS,"Between the years of twenty-five and thirty,"
2801,THE ARCHANGELS,"Her face glows and is white,"
2802,THE ARCHANGELS,Like the thin spirit of a candle light.
2803,THE ARCHANGELS,And over her forehead passes
2804,THE ARCHANGELS,"Swift waves of splendor, which must be her thought,"
2805,THE ARCHANGELS,"Looking, it seems, as if a snowy curtain"
2806,THE ARCHANGELS,Were rhythmically blown at dawn in a white room!
2807,THE ARCHANGELS,
2808,THE ARCHANGELS,In each of her eyes there is a blue-bright spark!
2809,THE ARCHANGELS,One time I saw two stars
2810,THE ARCHANGELS,Held in an inch of water when the evening
2811,THE ARCHANGELS,Was pale from dying day.
2812,THE ARCHANGELS,And under this thin water lay dead leaves
2813,THE ARCHANGELS,The drift of late October--
2814,THE ARCHANGELS,Gray leaves beneath clear water by an edge
2815,THE ARCHANGELS,"Where spring’s first flower, the azure pickerel weed,"
2816,THE ARCHANGELS,Bent over contemplated those two stars:
2817,THE ARCHANGELS,These were the sparks in her unruffled eyes.
2818,THE ARCHANGELS,Flopped on the floor
2819,THE ARCHANGELS,With little hands clasped round her girlish knees
2820,THE ARCHANGELS,Such musical thought sings through her cherub lips--
2821,THE ARCHANGELS,"Raptures for Beauty,"
2822,THE ARCHANGELS,"Raptures for Truth,"
2823,THE ARCHANGELS,Raptures for Freedom and a world that is free.
2824,THE ARCHANGELS,While around her flames the fire of a durable hope.
2825,THE ARCHANGELS,Till at last I sit in wonder
2826,THE ARCHANGELS,"At the miracle of such spirit,"
2827,THE ARCHANGELS,"And the miracle of the youths about her,"
2828,THE ARCHANGELS,"Listening with bright eyes, in the fellowship of delight,"
2829,THE ARCHANGELS,"Who prompt, suggest, applaud, are passionate"
2830,THE ARCHANGELS,"For the right word, the soaring thought to beat"
2831,THE ARCHANGELS,At heaven’s gate in a last burst of song.
2832,THE ARCHANGELS,"And here am I a part of this psychic circle,"
2833,THE ARCHANGELS,Bound with soft loops of gold in a charméd band
2834,THE ARCHANGELS,Of a brood of youthful archangels fiery and strong....
2835,THE ARCHANGELS,
2836,THE ARCHANGELS,Then thrilled with love of a land that can grow such souls
2837,THE ARCHANGELS,I turn and ask them questions:
2838,THE ARCHANGELS,"How old are you, who were your father and mother?"
2839,THE ARCHANGELS,What chance have you had in life?
2840,THE ARCHANGELS,What books have you read?
2841,THE ARCHANGELS,And where have you bred these dreams?
2842,THE ARCHANGELS,But why do you laugh? for there must be soil or blood
2843,THE ARCHANGELS,"Or both, for there must be the souls of free men"
2844,THE ARCHANGELS,"And the loins of free men,"
2845,THE ARCHANGELS,"To make archangels you know,"
2846,THE ARCHANGELS,And pour them into the city to think and plan
2847,THE ARCHANGELS,For a greater Republic to come.
2848,THE ARCHANGELS,And though it matters nothing that villages
2849,THE ARCHANGELS,"In Iowa, Indiana, Illinois"
2850,THE ARCHANGELS,"In the great far west, in New England, gave us you,"
2851,THE ARCHANGELS,"Or you, or you, or you--"
2852,THE ARCHANGELS,"I somehow thrill at the contrast, or thrill with the thought"
2853,THE ARCHANGELS,"Of such great richness and vastness in the land,"
2854,THE ARCHANGELS,"Flowering such souls all fresh and keen,"
2855,THE ARCHANGELS,And eager to make the Republic wholly free--
2856,THE ARCHANGELS,May she deserve your love!

3010,CATO BRADEN,
3011,CATO BRADEN,
3012,CATO BRADEN,I went to Winston Prairie to attend
3013,CATO BRADEN,The funeral of Cato Braden. He
3014,CATO BRADEN,Had died at fifty-one and I had known him
3015,CATO BRADEN,"Since he was twenty-four, but for fifteen"
3016,CATO BRADEN,"Years or more I had not seen him, nor"
3017,CATO BRADEN,Exchanged with him more than a telegraphic
3018,CATO BRADEN,Note about some trivial thing. Indeed
3019,CATO BRADEN,I had not been in Winston Prairie during
3020,CATO BRADEN,These fifteen years.
3021,CATO BRADEN,
3022,CATO BRADEN,But on the train I thought
3023,CATO BRADEN,"Of Cato Braden, brought back all the days"
3024,CATO BRADEN,"Through which I knew him, from the very first"
3025,CATO BRADEN,When he returned to Winston Prairie from
3026,CATO BRADEN,"De Pauw, or was it Valparaiso? Yet"
3027,CATO BRADEN,’Twas called a university I remember.
3028,CATO BRADEN,And when I knew him first he kept at hand
3029,CATO BRADEN,"De Senectute, also Anthon’s Homer,"
3030,CATO BRADEN,"And lexicons in Latin and in Greek,"
3031,CATO BRADEN,Both unabridged. Sometimes he let me read
3032,CATO BRADEN,The orations he had won the prizes with.
3033,CATO BRADEN,And sometimes he would tell me what it meant
3034,CATO BRADEN,To study at a university.
3035,CATO BRADEN,And what they did and what the boys were like.
3036,CATO BRADEN,This Cato Braden was a happy soul
3037,CATO BRADEN,"At twenty-four, of a full noble brow,"
3038,CATO BRADEN,"A gentle smiling mouth, an honest eye,"
3039,CATO BRADEN,"A tall and handsome figure, altogether"
3040,CATO BRADEN,"A man conspicuous for form, a bearing"
3041,CATO BRADEN,"Of grace and courtliness, engaging ways;"
3042,CATO BRADEN,"He might be called most lovable, he had"
3043,CATO BRADEN,"The gift of friendship, was not envious,"
3044,CATO BRADEN,"Could scarcely be enraged, was not offended"
3045,CATO BRADEN,By little things and often not by great.
3046,CATO BRADEN,He had in short a nature fit to work
3047,CATO BRADEN,With great capacity; had he combined
3048,CATO BRADEN,An intellect but half his nature’s worth
3049,CATO BRADEN,He might have won the race. But many thought
3050,CATO BRADEN,"He promised much, his father most of all"
3051,CATO BRADEN,"Because he had these virtues, and in truth"
3052,CATO BRADEN,Before his leaves unfolded with the spring
3053,CATO BRADEN,"His mind seemed apt, perhaps seemed measured full"
3054,CATO BRADEN,"Of quality, the prizes he had won"
3055,CATO BRADEN,At Valparaiso pointed to the fruit
3056,CATO BRADEN,He would produce at last.
3057,CATO BRADEN,
3058,CATO BRADEN,So on the train
3059,CATO BRADEN,I thought of Cato Braden. Then I thought
3060,CATO BRADEN,"Of when he came from school with his degree,"
3061,CATO BRADEN,"And for that summer when he walked the square,"
3062,CATO BRADEN,"Was whispered of as “Cato Braden, look.”"
3063,CATO BRADEN,The first thing Winston Prairie knew it saw
3064,CATO BRADEN,His name conjoined with that of Jerry Ott’s--
3065,CATO BRADEN,"It was Ott and Braden, editors and owners,"
3066,CATO BRADEN,The Winston Prairie Eagle. Jerry Ott
3067,CATO BRADEN,Was sixty-nine and wheezy from the fight
3068,CATO BRADEN,"For Jefferson Democracy, free trade."
3069,CATO BRADEN,Besides the capital that Cato Braden
3070,CATO BRADEN,Brought through his father to the enterprise
3071,CATO BRADEN,Meant bitter war on enemies of truth.
3072,CATO BRADEN,And Cato Braden’s father had some wealth
3073,CATO BRADEN,Made from the making of a vermifuge
3074,CATO BRADEN,And a preposterous compound which he called
3075,CATO BRADEN,Pesodorne; and I have always thought
3076,CATO BRADEN,That Cato Braden’s father garrisoned
3077,CATO BRADEN,His factory for making patent nostrums
3078,CATO BRADEN,"By buying for his son this interest,"
3079,CATO BRADEN,And place of power in journalism; for
3080,CATO BRADEN,The father’s strong devotion to the church
3081,CATO BRADEN,Did not protect him ’gainst the casual sneers
3082,CATO BRADEN,"Of Winston Prairie’s paper called the Lance,"
3083,CATO BRADEN,"Which used to print such things as this, to instance:"
3084,CATO BRADEN,"“There’s Braden’s Vermifuge, well, Doctor Braden,"
3085,CATO BRADEN,"Try your own vermifuge, let’s see it work.”"
3086,CATO BRADEN,
3087,CATO BRADEN,"Well, anyway I know that Cato Braden"
3088,CATO BRADEN,"Intended to pursue a legal course,"
3089,CATO BRADEN,And practice the profession in a city.
3090,CATO BRADEN,I know his father bought for him this place
3091,CATO BRADEN,With Jerry Ott as editor of the Eagle.
3092,CATO BRADEN,I know he went to work. I know he changed
3093,CATO BRADEN,"The paper’s motto from “Hew to the line,”"
3094,CATO BRADEN,To _Principia non homines_. I know
3095,CATO BRADEN,"He used to sing “Over the Garden Wall,”"
3096,CATO BRADEN,While writing editorials and smoked
3097,CATO BRADEN,A number of cheroots. I know he had
3098,CATO BRADEN,A locked drawer where he kept a secret bottle
3099,CATO BRADEN,From which he’d take a drink at noon or night.
3100,CATO BRADEN,I know he was on terms of friendship with
3101,CATO BRADEN,The milliner and dressmaker in a month
3102,CATO BRADEN,"After he came from Valparaiso. Yes,"
3103,CATO BRADEN,"I know he advocated a gymnasium,"
3104,CATO BRADEN,"And dancing hall for Winston Prairie, and"
3105,CATO BRADEN,He opened up a fight to get a park
3106,CATO BRADEN,Where concerts might be given. Cato Braden
3107,CATO BRADEN,Had these ideas at least. About this park
3108,CATO BRADEN,A word remains to say.
3109,CATO BRADEN,
3110,CATO BRADEN,"Fernando Winston,"
3111,CATO BRADEN,Who founded Winston Prairie and surveyed
3112,CATO BRADEN,"The original town, laid out a square along"
3113,CATO BRADEN,"The river for a pleasure ground; in time,"
3114,CATO BRADEN,"Some fifty years or more, it was forgotten."
3115,CATO BRADEN,And when this Cato Braden came to town
3116,CATO BRADEN,And started as a journalist ’twas used
3117,CATO BRADEN,In part by Winston Prairie’s creamery;
3118,CATO BRADEN,In part ’twas used for gardening by the pastor
3119,CATO BRADEN,Of Winston Prairie’s strongest church. But Cato
3120,CATO BRADEN,"Had searched the records, found them straight, began"
3121,CATO BRADEN,"To agitate the park. And it was this,"
3122,CATO BRADEN,"Together with _Principia non homines_,"
3123,CATO BRADEN,"Free trade, the dressmaker and milliner,"
3124,CATO BRADEN,"Perhaps the bottle in the drawer, whose secret"
3125,CATO BRADEN,"Leaked out at once, that clove the people of"
3126,CATO BRADEN,The town into two groups of friends and foes.
3127,CATO BRADEN,He had but just begun his editorship
3128,CATO BRADEN,When I left Winston Prairie; after that
3129,CATO BRADEN,"Knew little of it, saw him but at times,"
3130,CATO BRADEN,"Long separated, saw him not at all"
3131,CATO BRADEN,"For fifteen years before his death, and now"
3132,CATO BRADEN,Because I was his friend was on the train
3133,CATO BRADEN,His funeral to attend.
3134,CATO BRADEN,
3135,CATO BRADEN,I drove to Oakland
3136,CATO BRADEN,With Dr. Green and William Smoot the grocer.
3137,CATO BRADEN,"’Twas hot without a breeze, the town was still."
3138,CATO BRADEN,"The church bell tolled until we reached the grave,"
3139,CATO BRADEN,It was the church whose pastor used the square
3140,CATO BRADEN,For gardening. And on the way I asked
3141,CATO BRADEN,Why Cato Braden died at fifty-one.
3142,CATO BRADEN,"“Why, whisky,” answered William Smoot, the grocer,"
3143,CATO BRADEN,"“And women,” for he had bad luck they say."
3144,CATO BRADEN,"“How is that, Doc, you know?”"
3145,CATO BRADEN,
3146,CATO BRADEN,And Dr. Green
3147,CATO BRADEN,After a silence said: “It isn’t true.
3148,CATO BRADEN,"“He was as sound, so far as that’s concerned"
3149,CATO BRADEN,“As any of us.”
3150,CATO BRADEN,
3151,CATO BRADEN,Then I asked again
3152,CATO BRADEN,Why Cato Braden died at fifty-one.
3153,CATO BRADEN,"And Dr. Green said laughing, “Well, you know"
3154,CATO BRADEN,"“They die at thirty-one and forty-one,"
3155,CATO BRADEN,"“And sixty-one of what killed Cato Braden,"
3156,CATO BRADEN,“That’s Bright’s Disease.”
3157,CATO BRADEN,
3158,CATO BRADEN,“And whisky brings that on--”
3159,CATO BRADEN,I ventured to assert.
3160,CATO BRADEN,
3161,CATO BRADEN,“Sometimes” replied
3162,CATO BRADEN,"The man of medicine, “But other things"
3163,CATO BRADEN,“Produce it. There’s a man’s diathesis;
3164,CATO BRADEN,"“There’s worry, over-work, sometimes disease"
3165,CATO BRADEN,"“Suffered in childhood, leaving an effect"
3166,CATO BRADEN,"“Like soil, all fertilized for such seed as this."
3167,CATO BRADEN,"“He should have drunk no whisky, yet he drank"
3168,CATO BRADEN,“Not half so much as Winston Prairie thought.
3169,CATO BRADEN,“But you can see if whisky caused this thing
3170,CATO BRADEN,"“All whisky drinkers would be sure to have it,"
3171,CATO BRADEN,“Or die of it if not killed by a train.”
3172,CATO BRADEN,
3173,CATO BRADEN,"We left the carriage, having reached the place"
3174,CATO BRADEN,"Where Cato Braden’s grave was dug, and stood"
3175,CATO BRADEN,Together in a company of fifty
3176,CATO BRADEN,And heard the pastor pray for heaven’s lessons
3177,CATO BRADEN,From Cato Braden’s life. And after that
3178,CATO BRADEN,"We separated, made the horses trot"
3179,CATO BRADEN,To reach our different destinations. I
3180,CATO BRADEN,Looked up Will Boyden for a little talk
3181,CATO BRADEN,Before my train left for the city.
3182,CATO BRADEN,
3183,CATO BRADEN,Will
3184,CATO BRADEN,"Was in his office with his sleeves rolled up,"
3185,CATO BRADEN,"Cob-pipe in mouth, typing a legal paper,"
3186,CATO BRADEN,"A narratio in slander, so he said."
3187,CATO BRADEN,He smiled from ear to ear and dropped his work.
3188,CATO BRADEN,"“You’re here for Cato’s funeral,” he said,"
3189,CATO BRADEN,"And added, “It’s a shame he had to die,"
3190,CATO BRADEN,Damned if it isn’t.”
3191,CATO BRADEN,
3192,CATO BRADEN,Then I asked again
3193,CATO BRADEN,"Why Cato Braden died at fifty-one,"
3194,CATO BRADEN,"And Will said: “Winston Prairie, Illinois,"
3195,CATO BRADEN,Killed Cato Braden.”
3196,CATO BRADEN,
3197,CATO BRADEN,“Tell me what you mean?”
3198,CATO BRADEN,Then Will refreshed his pipe and talked to me:
3199,CATO BRADEN,“I’m fifty-two and good for twenty years
3200,CATO BRADEN,"I have no stronger frame than Cato Braden,"
3201,CATO BRADEN,But then I got a formula for life
3202,CATO BRADEN,"As time went on, and it was one that suited"
3203,CATO BRADEN,"My nature, and I thrived as you can see."
3204,CATO BRADEN,I have the power to draw the nutriment
3205,CATO BRADEN,"Out of this soil, and I get strength thereby"
3206,CATO BRADEN,Wherewith to overcome the things that kill.
3207,CATO BRADEN,"I work, but then I play, I hunt and fish,"
3208,CATO BRADEN,I read and sometimes take a little trip.
3209,CATO BRADEN,"I don’t drink whisky, not because I fear it,"
3210,CATO BRADEN,But I hate putting in myself such fire--
3211,CATO BRADEN,"Beer and light wines are pleasant, more like food"
3212,CATO BRADEN,"Than stimulants. Well, Cato Braden started"
3213,CATO BRADEN,"When ‘Over the Garden Wall’ was all the rage,"
3214,CATO BRADEN,‘All Coons Look Alike to Me’ was my
3215,CATO BRADEN,Key-note for starting. You know what I mean:
3216,CATO BRADEN,Between my day and his there’s just the difference
3217,CATO BRADEN,That lies between waltz time and syncopation;
3218,CATO BRADEN,"Between the magic lantern and the movie,"
3219,CATO BRADEN,The rattan phaeton and Ford machine.
3220,CATO BRADEN,"These new things came along before he died,"
3221,CATO BRADEN,"But he had made his life for the old things,"
3222,CATO BRADEN,"Could not adjust himself, De Senectute"
3223,CATO BRADEN,And Valparaiso had not taught him how
3224,CATO BRADEN,To reach out in the world from Winston Prairie
3225,CATO BRADEN,And get the new things for his life. But if
3226,CATO BRADEN,They taught him how he lost the secret here.
3227,CATO BRADEN,For after all a place like Winston Prairie
3228,CATO BRADEN,Will kill your spirit just as surely as
3229,CATO BRADEN,The Island where they cooped up great Napoleon.
3230,CATO BRADEN,In the first place what is a man to do
3231,CATO BRADEN,With life in any place? That is the problem.
3232,CATO BRADEN,And what could Cato Braden do with life
3233,CATO BRADEN,In Winston Prairie? First he was as fitted
3234,CATO BRADEN,"To be a journalist as I, and if"
3235,CATO BRADEN,"Endowed to be a journalist, just think"
3236,CATO BRADEN,Of editing The Eagle. But you see
3237,CATO BRADEN,His father was at war then with the Lance
3238,CATO BRADEN,Over that vermifuge and pesodorne.
3239,CATO BRADEN,And under guise of starting him in life
3240,CATO BRADEN,Bought Cato in the paper for the selfish
3241,CATO BRADEN,Purpose of defending vermifuge.
3242,CATO BRADEN,"And Cato did it too, and put away"
3243,CATO BRADEN,From year to year his dream of studying
3244,CATO BRADEN,The law and practicing in a city.
3245,CATO BRADEN,During which time the poisons of this town
3246,CATO BRADEN,Crept in his blood and stupefied and killed him.
3247,CATO BRADEN,"He married Mary Comfort, as you know."
3248,CATO BRADEN,"And Mary is--well, what I call a brood-mare,"
3249,CATO BRADEN,Although they had no children. What I mean
3250,CATO BRADEN,"She is a well-fleshed woman, sound of nerve,"
3251,CATO BRADEN,"A help-eat, but she made a loyal wife"
3252,CATO BRADEN,"Who had two eyes to see what Cato saw,"
3253,CATO BRADEN,And never an eye to help him see the things
3254,CATO BRADEN,"That lay around him, which he stumbled over."
3255,CATO BRADEN,And marriage to my mind means this to man:
3256,CATO BRADEN,"He drains his body out to be a father,"
3257,CATO BRADEN,"And drains his spirit out to be a husband,"
3258,CATO BRADEN,Unless the woman helps him see or feel
3259,CATO BRADEN,More than he sees or feels for self. Well then
3260,CATO BRADEN,The years went on. And every day at eight
3261,CATO BRADEN,He could be seen toward his office bent.
3262,CATO BRADEN,At half past ten just as the morning train
3263,CATO BRADEN,Was whistling for the crossing he would go
3264,CATO BRADEN,To get the mail. Returning he would walk
3265,CATO BRADEN,"Along Main Street, slapping the folded News"
3266,CATO BRADEN,Against his leg. He scanned it in his office.
3267,CATO BRADEN,"At twelve o’clock he went to dinner, then"
3268,CATO BRADEN,"As whisky made him eat, he over-ate"
3269,CATO BRADEN,And took a nap till two o’clock. At three
3270,CATO BRADEN,One might discover him at solitaire--
3271,CATO BRADEN,He had clipped from the morning paper quite enough
3272,CATO BRADEN,To keep the boys in copy. Then at four
3273,CATO BRADEN,"He might be sitting at the livery stable,"
3274,CATO BRADEN,Or sometimes might be found in that back room
3275,CATO BRADEN,"Of Little’s restaurant, where a keg of beer"
3276,CATO BRADEN,Shipped in was being tapped. At night perhaps
3277,CATO BRADEN,"He might be seen down there on Locust street,"
3278,CATO BRADEN,Waiting to enter where the milliner lived.
3279,CATO BRADEN,So passed his life away from twenty-four
3280,CATO BRADEN,To fifty-one. It’s simple enough to ask
3281,CATO BRADEN,"Why not write for the Eagle, make it better,"
3282,CATO BRADEN,"Give ideas to the people, help the town,"
3283,CATO BRADEN,"Refresh the mind, read, study history,"
3284,CATO BRADEN,"De Senectute? Fancy Teddy Roosevelt,"
3285,CATO BRADEN,"Who’s labored for this land with restless gifts,"
3286,CATO BRADEN,"Tied down in Winston Prairie--well, you can’t,"
3287,CATO BRADEN,"He’d break the ties, and that’s the point, you see."
3288,CATO BRADEN,"For Cato couldn’t break them, had to stay,"
3289,CATO BRADEN,"Incapable to extract the good that’s here,"
3290,CATO BRADEN,Susceptible to all the bad that’s here;
3291,CATO BRADEN,He was a nose half active
3292,CATO BRADEN,"Who enters in a room where gas escapes,"
3293,CATO BRADEN,Sits in the room unconscious of the gas
3294,CATO BRADEN,"Till he grows sluggish, lies him down to rest"
3295,CATO BRADEN,And dies unknowing. So I say it’s true
3296,CATO BRADEN,That Winston Prairie ruined Cato Braden
3297,CATO BRADEN,And killed him in the end.
3298,CATO BRADEN,
3299,CATO BRADEN,"You must go see,"
3300,CATO BRADEN,"Before you leave, our park called Willard Park,"
3301,CATO BRADEN,"Named after Emma Willard, that devout"
3302,CATO BRADEN,"Old woman, dead these fifteen years or so."
3303,CATO BRADEN,"She left enough to build a granite coping,"
3304,CATO BRADEN,"Set out some trees, and buy park seats, a stone"
3305,CATO BRADEN,"Whereon to carve the words, ‘The gracious gift"
3306,CATO BRADEN,"Of Emma Willard.’ Well, this Cato Braden"
3307,CATO BRADEN,"First talked this park, was first to tell the truth"
3308,CATO BRADEN,About this plot of ground. And more than that
3309,CATO BRADEN,When Cato Braden came here he had dreams:
3310,CATO BRADEN,"He wrote at first that boxing, wrestling, racing"
3311,CATO BRADEN,Would help this town; that games were needed here;
3312,CATO BRADEN,That Americans seemed ignorant of the art
3313,CATO BRADEN,"Of being gay, feeling light-hearted, wise"
3314,CATO BRADEN,"To play; that they were wise to work and pray,"
3315,CATO BRADEN,Fear happiness. And Cato Braden said
3316,CATO BRADEN,"The little town was cursed by just these things,"
3317,CATO BRADEN,And many human souls destroyed by them.
3318,CATO BRADEN,"These were not thoughts of his, he found them somewhere,"
3319,CATO BRADEN,"But knew them when he found them, that’s his credit."
3320,CATO BRADEN,What though he was a drunk man whom you ask
3321,CATO BRADEN,"What road to take, who points and gurgles guttural"
3322,CATO BRADEN,Sounds inarticulate? Or better still
3323,CATO BRADEN,What though he was a sick man who in vain
3324,CATO BRADEN,Attempts to make his household orders clear?
3325,CATO BRADEN,For it was true that Cato Braden spoke
3326,CATO BRADEN,"About these things at first, then gave them up."
3327,CATO BRADEN,For no one seemed responsive to his plans.
3328,CATO BRADEN,"And some there were who sneered, and others said"
3329,CATO BRADEN,"He’d better help the church, and leave alone"
3330,CATO BRADEN,"The questions which make bitterness and strife,"
3331,CATO BRADEN,Which was their way of speaking of the square
3332,CATO BRADEN,Which Cato tried to make into a park.
3333,CATO BRADEN,They say a lung will turn to stone or steel
3334,CATO BRADEN,When men work in the filings and the dust.
3335,CATO BRADEN,At last the dust of Winston Prairie turned
3336,CATO BRADEN,His soul to dust.
3337,CATO BRADEN,
3338,CATO BRADEN,You see old Jerry Ott
3339,CATO BRADEN,"Had left a son his interest in the Eagle,"
3340,CATO BRADEN,And Cato Braden died right at his table
3341,CATO BRADEN,While playing solitaire. This son came in
3342,CATO BRADEN,"And found him dead, a card clutched in his hand."
3343,CATO BRADEN,"The card was, strange enough, the deuce of clubs!"
3344,CATO BRADEN,This son was glad that Cato Braden died
3345,CATO BRADEN,For now he runs the Eagle by himself.
3346,CATO BRADEN,This Cato Braden had three strains of thought.
3347,CATO BRADEN,I never met him lately but he talked
3348,CATO BRADEN,"Some one of them, at times all three of them."
3349,CATO BRADEN,"One was the American town must be improved,"
3350,CATO BRADEN,So better to conserve the souls and bodies
3351,CATO BRADEN,"Of boys and girls. And even when the movie,"
3352,CATO BRADEN,And other things of this day came along
3353,CATO BRADEN,He still maintained they did not meet the case.
3354,CATO BRADEN,He never said what thing was requisite.
3355,CATO BRADEN,But in a general way I think he meant
3356,CATO BRADEN,"A stronger, and more truthful and more natural"
3357,CATO BRADEN,Outlook and attitude would save a town
3358,CATO BRADEN,"From dust, and mold and death. For once he said:"
3359,CATO BRADEN,“This winter I shall read Grote’s History.”
3360,CATO BRADEN,He never read it. But I think he meant
3361,CATO BRADEN,He would find out the secret of the Greeks.
3362,CATO BRADEN,"And then he’d say the young, the middle aged"
3363,CATO BRADEN,"The old made separate spheres of feeling, thought;"
3364,CATO BRADEN,"And that a town should not be ruled by one,"
3365,CATO BRADEN,"Should not be governed as all folks were old,"
3366,CATO BRADEN,"Or young, or middle aged, but each should have"
3367,CATO BRADEN,"The town for his according to his age,"
3368,CATO BRADEN,"And thought and vital power, within his sphere"
3369,CATO BRADEN,And period of life; these separate spheres
3370,CATO BRADEN,"Should move untroubled by the others, move"
3371,CATO BRADEN,"Free, independent of the other spheres."
3372,CATO BRADEN,
3373,CATO BRADEN,I talked with Cato Braden for the last
3374,CATO BRADEN,A week ago last night. He said to me:
3375,CATO BRADEN,I wake these mornings lately with the thought
3376,CATO BRADEN,"Another chance will come to me, that death"
3377,CATO BRADEN,Will bring another chance. And then he said:
3378,CATO BRADEN,This is the way of it. When you are young
3379,CATO BRADEN,"You say in five years I shall take a trip,"
3380,CATO BRADEN,"See New York City, go abroad perhaps."
3381,CATO BRADEN,When five years pass you do not take the trip.
3382,CATO BRADEN,Then you say in a year I’ll take the trip.
3383,CATO BRADEN,"And so it goes, while you say in a year,"
3384,CATO BRADEN,"Next year, next year, until at last you say"
3385,CATO BRADEN,"No, never now! Well, now you’d think a man"
3386,CATO BRADEN,"Would weep when he stands up against the wall,"
3387,CATO BRADEN,"And knows he cannot climb the wall. But no,"
3388,CATO BRADEN,Something still whispers you will do it yet.
3389,CATO BRADEN,"And then you know it must be after death,"
3390,CATO BRADEN,"In life again, the chance will come to you."
3391,CATO BRADEN,For you know well it is not in this life.
3392,CATO BRADEN,Then Cato Braden said: Not in this life
3393,CATO BRADEN,"Shall I read Grote, I could not understand it"
3394,CATO BRADEN,After these years in Winston Prairie--still
3395,CATO BRADEN,I have a feeling I shall know about it
3396,CATO BRADEN,"Somewhere, somehow."
3397,CATO BRADEN,You’d better catch your train.
3398,CATO BRADEN,It’s good to see you. Up there in the city
3399,CATO BRADEN,Think sometimes of the American village and
3400,CATO BRADEN,What may be done for conservation of
3401,CATO BRADEN,The souls of men and women in the village.”
3402,CATO BRADEN,
3403,CATO BRADEN,
3404,CATO BRADEN,
3405,CATO BRADEN,
3406,WINSTON PRAIRIE,WINSTON PRAIRIE
3407,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3408,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3409,WINSTON PRAIRIE,“What made you buy those lots in Winston Prairie?
3410,WINSTON PRAIRIE,If you had come to me I could have told you
3411,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"About the circuit judge, the state’s attorney,"
3412,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"The county judge, the county clerk, the treasurer,"
3413,WINSTON PRAIRIE,The assessors and collectors who belong
3414,WINSTON PRAIRIE,To what we call a court-house ring. You know
3415,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"They run the county, re-elect themselves,"
3416,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Play with the local bosses, stand in league"
3417,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"With sellers of cement, and brick and lumber,"
3418,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And with the papers given the public printing,"
3419,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And with the sharks who buy in property
3420,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"For taxes sold, and with the intriguing thieves"
3421,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Who make improvements, levy the assessments"
3422,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"For side-walk, sewers.”"
3423,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3424,WINSTON PRAIRIE,So my friend to me.
3425,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"“Good land,” I answered, “I inherited them,"
3426,WINSTON PRAIRIE,I did not buy these lots. But apropos
3427,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Of what you say, I’ve wondered what’s the matter."
3428,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I write and write for statements of my taxes,"
3429,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And cannot get them. Then I take the train,"
3430,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And travel through the heat to Winston Prairie.
3431,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And I stand before a window asking for them.
3432,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Your property was sold, I am informed."
3433,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"So I redeem, and go out to the grave-yard"
3434,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"To look at Cato Braden’s grave, and then"
3435,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Catch the next train for home. A week or so
3436,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Elapses and I get a letter--hum!
3437,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Winston Prairie--office of the controller;
3438,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Your property was sold for special numbered
3439,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Two thousand and eighty-six, when you reply"
3440,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Please mention sale 1019.--Damn these thieves!
3441,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"So I pay that. I see! your court-house ring,--"
3442,WINSTON PRAIRIE,The men who’re sworn to enforce the law are those
3443,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Who break it, and who use it to despoil you--"
3444,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Well, let me tell you."
3445,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3446,WINSTON PRAIRIE,In this very June
3447,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I went to Winston Prairie on this errand,"
3448,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And after I had written several times
3449,WINSTON PRAIRIE,To get a statement. I arrived at noon--
3450,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And yet the court-house offices were closed,"
3451,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"The treasurer’s, the clerk’s, controller’s, all."
3452,WINSTON PRAIRIE,I met a janitor who said: All closed
3453,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Till half past one. That meant I’d miss my train
3454,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Back to Chicago, and would have to stay"
3455,WINSTON PRAIRIE,In Winston Prairie until six o’clock.
3456,WINSTON PRAIRIE,I sat down in the hall-way with a curse.
3457,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"But in a minute there were hideous yells,"
3458,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Shrieks, curses, as it were of women beaten,"
3459,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Tortured, or strangled. So I went to see,"
3460,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And found a door behind which I could hear
3461,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Intolerable tears, the scratching of weak hands"
3462,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Against the door and wall. What is the matter?
3463,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I hallooed through the door. O, go to hell"
3464,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"A woman said, you know what is the matter."
3465,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I don’t, I said, I’ll help you if I can."
3466,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Then followed sobs and wails, and incoherent"
3467,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Blubbering of words. At last I saw a finger
3468,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Stuck through the broken plaster by the door,"
3469,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And leaning down I said: look through at me.
3470,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And then I stooped and looking through the crack
3471,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Saw a gray eye, which looked as it might be"
3472,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Of Slavic birth. But who can read an eye
3473,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Shown singly through a crack? So while I talked
3474,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"To get the story of these girls in prison,"
3475,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"(For where they were was called the calaboose,"
3476,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Built in the court-house) some one back of me
3477,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Said: They’ll be quiet in due time, the cooler"
3478,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Cools people off. I turned and saw a man
3479,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Who seemed to be a judge, and was a judge,"
3480,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"As I discovered later. Well, I said,"
3481,WINSTON PRAIRIE,I cannot bear to see a human being
3482,WINSTON PRAIRIE,In such distress and terror--what’s their ages?
3483,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"One’s sixteen and one’s seventeen, said the judge,"
3484,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"But they are bad ones, so I made the fine"
3485,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Enough to hold them thirty days. I asked
3486,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"What did they do? They were soliciting,"
3487,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"The judge replied, and here in Winston Prairie"
3488,WINSTON PRAIRIE,The law is law and we enforce the law.
3489,WINSTON PRAIRIE,We do not do as you do in Chicago.
3490,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I felt my heart shut tight its valves and stop,"
3491,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And was about to say: You are a fool.
3492,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"You are what some would have America,"
3493,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"You are an Illinoisan, damn your soul."
3494,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"You are a figure in the court-house ring,"
3495,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Whereof the tax shark is a figure too.
3496,WINSTON PRAIRIE,But then I thought these girls might prove to be
3497,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Worth while some time. But even if they live
3498,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Street walkers all their lives, they stone no prophets,"
3499,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Devour no widows’ houses, do less harm"
3500,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Than court-house rings and judges in the rings.
3501,WINSTON PRAIRIE,So this is what I said: May I enquire
3502,WINSTON PRAIRIE,What are your Honor’s hours for holding court?
3503,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And he replied: Court has adjourned till two.
3504,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I hold till six o’clock, we do not loaf"
3505,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"As judges in Chicago do, good-day!"
3506,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3507,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Well, then at half past one I paid my taxes,"
3508,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"With interest, penalties and all the costs."
3509,WINSTON PRAIRIE,At two o’clock I stood before the bar
3510,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And to the judge addressed these words: Your Honor,"
3511,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I represent Miss Christine Leichentritt,"
3512,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Miss Garda Gerstenburg, who are in jail"
3513,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Under your Honor’s sentence. I have seen
3514,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"The state’s attorney, who is satisfied"
3515,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"To let them go, if all the costs are paid."
3516,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I went to see him on a matter of taxes,"
3517,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And this came up. The state’s attorney rose
3518,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And said: Your Honor, they are very young,"
3519,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And though they have been caught before at this,"
3520,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And warned that Winston Prairie is no place
3521,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"For them to ply their trade, I am inclined"
3522,WINSTON PRAIRIE,To think they will not break our laws again.
3523,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3524,WINSTON PRAIRIE,I thought I saw his honor’s eye light up
3525,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"As if it caught a wireless, so he said:"
3526,WINSTON PRAIRIE,“The court is satisfied.” I paid the costs
3527,WINSTON PRAIRIE,And took Christine and Garda to Chicago.
3528,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"But at the station, as I said good bye,"
3529,WINSTON PRAIRIE,Christine flared up: You don’t suppose that I
3530,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Will let you pay those costs, I am not cheap."
3531,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"I may be bad, but I am square, she said."
3532,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"And I have money in my room, come on"
3533,WINSTON PRAIRIE,To Twelfth and Wabash and I’ll pay you back
3534,WINSTON PRAIRIE,For me and Garda.
3535,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3536,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"No, I said, go on."
3537,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Try to be good, but if you can’t be good,"
3538,WINSTON PRAIRIE,"Be wise, and do not go to Winston Prairie."
3539,WINSTON PRAIRIE,I turned and disappeared among the crowds.
3540,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3541,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3542,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3543,WINSTON PRAIRIE,
3544,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES
3545,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,
3546,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,
3547,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,The Sunday after Cato Braden died
3548,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Will Boyden lectured in the Masons’ Hall
3549,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Upon the theme, “Was Jesus Really Great?”"
3550,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,At first he pointed out that Jesus knew
3551,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,No history except that of the Jews.
3552,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And if he’d heard of Athens never spoke
3553,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"A word about it, never read a line"
3554,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Of Homer, Sophocles, or Aristotle,"
3555,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Or Plato, or of Virgil, never a word"
3556,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Concerning Egypt’s wisdom, or of India’s."
3557,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And then he dropped this point with the remark
3558,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,That one could know one’s people’s history
3559,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"And that alone, and still be great, perhaps."
3560,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,But still he thought it was unfortunate
3561,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,That Jesus gave the Hebrews such a lift
3562,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,So that to-day they rule the Occident
3563,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Where Athens should have ruled, if only Time"
3564,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Had given her the right dramatic touch
3565,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,To catch the populace.
3566,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,
3567,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,He then declared
3568,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"That Jesus was a poet, but he said:"
3569,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"“What are his figures? Never a word of stars,"
3570,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"And never a word of oceans, nor of mountains"
3571,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Save Olivet or Zion, so you see"
3572,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,His limitations as to imagery.
3573,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Then have you noted how his sombre soul
3574,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Picked blasted fig-trees, tares, the leprous poor,"
3575,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"And sepulchres and sewers, dirty cups,"
3576,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Wherewith to make interpretations, yes"
3577,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"He spoke of lilies, too. Well, so have I."
3578,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And yet you people call me pessimist
3579,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Because I’ve tried to rescue Winston Prairie,"
3580,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And have not shrunk from charging Winston Prairie
3581,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,With Cato Braden’s death. The difference
3582,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Between the Man of Galilee and me
3583,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Is this: He wanted to fulfill the law
3584,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Of Moses and Isaiah, make Jerusalem,"
3585,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Which was a Winston Prairie in a way,"
3586,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,A Hebrew citadel to rule the world.
3587,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"And I, if I could have my way, would make"
3588,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Of Winston Prairie Athens.”
3589,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,
3590,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Then he said
3591,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,“I have four thoughts to-day to touch upon.
3592,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,The first one is concerning hogs--you start:
3593,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Well, look at Matthew chapter eight and find"
3594,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,How certain hogs had cast in them the devils
3595,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Of fierceness, blindness, lustfulness and ran"
3596,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Down in the sea to kill themselves for being
3597,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Made perfecter as hogs. Go get some hogs
3598,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And let me try my hand at exorcising
3599,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,
3600,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,The Winston Prairie devils which destroyed
3601,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Poor Cato Braden.
3602,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,“My next thought is found
3603,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,In Matthew chapter nine; and it is this;
3604,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"When Jesus saw the multitude all fainting,"
3605,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"And scattered abroad as sheep without a shepherd,"
3606,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"His soul was stirred--that is a way with genius,"
3607,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Whether it be your Altgeld, Pericles,"
3608,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Or yet your artist soul like Heinrich Heine.
3609,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,But think of this: If you would lead and save
3610,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"The multitude, assuming that can be,"
3611,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Shall you accomplish it by rules and laws
3612,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Applied externally, which is the way"
3613,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Ecclesiastic powers pursue and find
3614,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Divine authority in Jesus for it?
3615,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Or shall you teach the way of opening up
3616,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"The soul of man to sun-light, letting in"
3617,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"The Power which is around us, in the which"
3618,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"We live and move, and so give chance for growth"
3619,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,To what is in us? For your shepherd drives.
3620,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"No, Jesus hit it better when he spoke"
3621,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Of leaven than of shepherds.
3622,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,“So if one
3623,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Find leaven and would give it, let there be"
3624,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"A few to watch the final hour with him,"
3625,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"When he would be delivered from the cup,"
3626,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"But knows it cannot be, that to refuse"
3627,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,The cup is to deny the inexorable law.
3628,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,
3629,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,“So now I come to what is chiefest here:
3630,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Destroy this temple and I will re-build it
3631,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,In three days. Now you know what preachers say:
3632,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,This means the resurrection--not at all!
3633,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,These were the greatest words that Jesus said.
3634,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"And here his genius seized its fullest power,"
3635,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Here was it that he hid Jerusalem
3636,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Under his hands as if it were a toy,"
3637,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And tossed the world up as it were a ball.
3638,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Why, what are temples, cities, cultures, ages"
3639,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Of beauty, glory, but the work of genius?"
3640,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,What earth and stone and flesh but plastic stuff
3641,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Responsive to the touch of prophet hands?
3642,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"What Winston Prairie, what America"
3643,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,And all this turbulence of bobbing heads
3644,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"In fields and markets, temples, halls across"
3645,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,This continent of sovereign states but puppets
3646,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Which may be changed in flesh, in deepest spirit,"
3647,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Made more erect, heroic, God-like, wise"
3648,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"By genius’ hands, not revolutionists’,"
3649,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Nor shepherds’. So destroy America,"
3650,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"But not by picks and axes, let it be"
3651,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,As in the movies where a lovelier face
3652,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,"Steals in and blots with brighter light a face,"
3653,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Which must fade out to let the lovelier face
3654,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Complete the story.
3655,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Now in a moment’s silence
3656,WILL BOYDEN LECTURES,Let’s pray for Cato Braden.”

3665,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,And yet above the forest’s leafy gloom
3666,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,The glory of the evening lightens still.
3667,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Smooth as a mirror is the river’s face
3668,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"With Heaven’s light, and all its radiant clouds"
3669,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,And shadows which against the river’s shore
3670,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Already are as night. From some retreat
3671,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Obscure and lonely, evening’s saddest bird"
3672,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Whistles, and beyond the water comes"
3673,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"The musical reply, and silence reigns--"
3674,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Save for the noisy chorus of the frogs,"
3675,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,And undistinguished sounds of faint portent
3676,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,That night has come. There is a rustic bridge
3677,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Which spans the stream, from which we look below"
3678,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"At Heaven above, till revery reclaims"
3679,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,The mind from hurried thought and merges it
3680,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Into the universal mind which broods
3681,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,O’er such a scene. Strange quietude o’erspreads
3682,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"The restless flame of being, and the soul"
3683,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Beholds its source and destiny and feels
3684,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Not sorrowful to sink into the breast
3685,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Of that large life whereof it is a part.
3686,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,What are we? But the question is not solved
3687,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Here in the presence of intensest thought,"
3688,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Where nature stills the clamor of the world,"
3689,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,And leaves us in communion with ourselves.
3690,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Hence to the strivings of the clear-eyed day
3691,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,What take we that shall mitigate the pangs
3692,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"That each soul is alone, and that all friends"
3693,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Gentle and wise and good can never soothe
3694,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,The ache of that sub-consciousness which is
3695,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Something unfathomed and unmedicined?
3696,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Yet this it is which keeps us in the path
3697,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Of some ambition cherished or pursued;
3698,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"The still, small voice that is not quieted"
3699,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"By disregard, but ever speaks to us"
3700,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Its mandates while we wake or sleep, and asks"
3701,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,A closer harmony with that great scheme
3702,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Which is the music of the universe.
3703,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,
3704,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,So as the cherubim of Heaven defend
3705,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"The realms of the unknown with flaming swords,"
3706,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Thence are we driven to the world which is
3707,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Ours to be known through Art, who beckons us"
3708,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"To excellence, and in her rarer moods"
3709,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Casts shadowy glances of serener lands,"
3710,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"Where all the serious gods, removed from stress"
3711,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"And interruption, build, as we conceive,"
3712,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,In fellowship that knows not that reserve
3713,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,Which clouds the hearts of those who wish to live
3714,THE DESPLAINES FOREST,"As they, in that large realm of perfect mind."

3719,THE GARDEN,THE GARDEN
3720,THE GARDEN,
3721,THE GARDEN,
3722,THE GARDEN,"I do not like my garden, but I love"
3723,THE GARDEN,The trees I planted and the flowers thereof.
3724,THE GARDEN,How does one choose his garden? O with eyes
3725,THE GARDEN,O’er which a passion or illusion lies.
3726,THE GARDEN,Perhaps it wakens memories of a lawn
3727,THE GARDEN,You knew before somewhere. Or you are drawn
3728,THE GARDEN,"By an old urn, a little gate, a roof"
3729,THE GARDEN,"Which soars into a blue sky, clear, aloof."
3730,THE GARDEN,One buys a garden gladly. Even the worst
3731,THE GARDEN,Seems tolerable or beautiful at first.
3732,THE GARDEN,Their very faults give loving labor scope:
3733,THE GARDEN,"One can correct, adorn; ’tis sweet to hope"
3734,THE GARDEN,"For beauty to emerge out of your toil,"
3735,THE GARDEN,To build the walks and fertilize the soil.
3736,THE GARDEN,Before I knew my garden or awoke
3737,THE GARDEN,To its banality I set an oak
3738,THE GARDEN,"At one end for a life-long husbandry,"
3739,THE GARDEN,"A white syringa and a lilac tree,"
3740,THE GARDEN,"Close to one side to hide a crumbling wall,"
3741,THE GARDEN,"Which was my neighbor’s, held in several"
3742,THE GARDEN,Title and beyond my right to mend--
3743,THE GARDEN,One cannot with an ancient time contend.
3744,THE GARDEN,Some houses shadowed me. I did not dream
3745,THE GARDEN,"The sun would never look o’er them and gleam,"
3746,THE GARDEN,Save at the earliest hour. So all the day
3747,THE GARDEN,One half my garden under twilight lay.
3748,THE GARDEN,Another soul had overlooked the shade:
3749,THE GARDEN,I found the boundaries of a bed he made
3750,THE GARDEN,"For tulips. Well, I had a fresher trust"
3751,THE GARDEN,And spent my heart upon this sterile dust.
3752,THE GARDEN,What thing will grow where never the sun shines?
3753,THE GARDEN,Vainly I planted flowering stalks and vines.
3754,THE GARDEN,What years to learn the soil! Why even weeds
3755,THE GARDEN,Look green and fresh. But if one concedes
3756,THE GARDEN,"Salvia will flourish not, nor palest phlox"
3757,THE GARDEN,One might have hope left for a row of box.
3758,THE GARDEN,
3759,THE GARDEN,Why is it that some silent places thrill
3760,THE GARDEN,"With elfin comradeship, and others fill"
3761,THE GARDEN,The heart with sickening loneliness? My breast
3762,THE GARDEN,"Seems hollow for great emptiness, unrest"
3763,THE GARDEN,Casting my eyes about my garden where
3764,THE GARDEN,"I still must live, breathing its lifeless air."
3765,THE GARDEN,Why should I have a garden anyway?
3766,THE GARDEN,I have so many friends who pass the day
3767,THE GARDEN,"In streets or squares, or little barren courts,"
3768,THE GARDEN,"I fancy there are gardens of all sorts,"
3769,THE GARDEN,Far worse than mine. And who has this delight:
3770,THE GARDEN,There’s my syringa with its blooms of white!
3771,THE GARDEN,It flourishes in my garden! In this brief
3772,THE GARDEN,Season of blossoms and unfolding leaf
3773,THE GARDEN,What if I like my garden not but love
3774,THE GARDEN,"The oak tree and the lilac tree thereof,"
3775,THE GARDEN,"And hide my face, lest one my rapture guess,"
3776,THE GARDEN,Amid the white syringa’s loveliness?

3781,THE TAVERN,THE TAVERN
3782,THE TAVERN,
3783,THE TAVERN,(_For my daughter Madeline_)
3784,THE TAVERN,
3785,THE TAVERN,
3786,THE TAVERN,"Nothing disturbed my night of sleep,"
3787,THE TAVERN,I wonder that I ever woke
3788,THE TAVERN,"It was so heavy, was so deep"
3789,THE TAVERN,I scarce had heard the thunder-stroke.
3790,THE TAVERN,"So what was drinking, feasting, talking"
3791,THE TAVERN,"By guests who came and guests who went,"
3792,THE TAVERN,Or those who spent the time in walking
3793,THE TAVERN,The halls and rooms in argument
3794,THE TAVERN,About the Tavern? Some declared
3795,THE TAVERN,No better Tavern could be built.
3796,THE TAVERN,"And others called it a deception,"
3797,THE TAVERN,"Its purest gold but thinnest gilt,"
3798,THE TAVERN,A cruel cheat considering
3799,THE TAVERN,No other Tavern gave reception
3800,THE TAVERN,To folks who might be wayfaring
3801,THE TAVERN,Anywhere in the whole wide land.
3802,THE TAVERN,
3803,THE TAVERN,"I woke a stranger to it all,"
3804,THE TAVERN,But quickly grew to understand
3805,THE TAVERN,The ways and customs which prevailed:
3806,THE TAVERN,"Those who won favor, those who failed;"
3807,THE TAVERN,What feasting rooms had echoed laughter;
3808,THE TAVERN,What kisses stolen in what hall;
3809,THE TAVERN,What corners where the old had cried;
3810,THE TAVERN,What stairways where the breathless bride
3811,THE TAVERN,Paused for a moment just to toss
3812,THE TAVERN,Among the bridesmaids her bouquet;
3813,THE TAVERN,What rooms where men in work or play
3814,THE TAVERN,Approved or cursed for gain or loss
3815,THE TAVERN,"The Tavern’s roof-tree, roof and rafter."
3816,THE TAVERN,
3817,THE TAVERN,"Then when I woke, as I have said,"
3818,THE TAVERN,Save a few children there was none
3819,THE TAVERN,Who was not older far than I.
3820,THE TAVERN,Many were trembling gray of head;
3821,THE TAVERN,The strong walked forth in rain or sun
3822,THE TAVERN,And seemed all danger to defy.
3823,THE TAVERN,"All welcomed me and called me fair,"
3824,THE TAVERN,And told me strange events which passed
3825,THE TAVERN,Around the Tavern while I slept.
3826,THE TAVERN,Soon there were changes. Scarce aware
3827,THE TAVERN,Of their departure many stept
3828,THE TAVERN,Out of the door and seemed to cast
3829,THE TAVERN,"Their fortunes elsewhere, but as fast"
3830,THE TAVERN,New guests came in to take the places
3831,THE TAVERN,Of those who left. And through the day
3832,THE TAVERN,"I lost the old, remembering faces"
3833,THE TAVERN,Freshly arrived. When it was noon
3834,THE TAVERN,"I knew what things were opportune,"
3835,THE TAVERN,I had become one of the crowd
3836,THE TAVERN,In all their ways initiate:
3837,THE TAVERN,"Knew what their love was, what their hate,"
3838,THE TAVERN,"Myself stole kisses in the hall,"
3839,THE TAVERN,And saw the old who sat and cried
3840,THE TAVERN,"In corners, saw the rosy bride"
3841,THE TAVERN,Pause for a moment just to toss
3842,THE TAVERN,"Among the bridesmaids her bouquet,"
3843,THE TAVERN,Where I stood best man to the groom.
3844,THE TAVERN,"Was myself of the noisy room,"
3845,THE TAVERN,Where men in work or men in play
3846,THE TAVERN,Approve or curse the gain or loss.
3847,THE TAVERN,
3848,THE TAVERN,Toward afternoon I seemed to feel
3849,THE TAVERN,More people knew me than I knew.
3850,THE TAVERN,Then it was good to meet with you.
3851,THE TAVERN,I saw you as you left the stair.
3852,THE TAVERN,And who were you? I do not dare
3853,THE TAVERN,"To praise your brow, or paint your hair,"
3854,THE TAVERN,"Your eyes how gray, or were they blue?"
3855,THE TAVERN,A pain strikes through me if I let
3856,THE TAVERN,The full strength of my love have sway.
3857,THE TAVERN,I only know I can forget
3858,THE TAVERN,All others who had gone away
3859,THE TAVERN,Remembering our happy day
3860,THE TAVERN,Together in the house and yard.
3861,THE TAVERN,It was to you all fair and new.
3862,THE TAVERN,You listened with such rapt regard
3863,THE TAVERN,"To all the stories of the guests,"
3864,THE TAVERN,And what had been their interests.
3865,THE TAVERN,And was the Tavern just the same
3866,THE TAVERN,"As it had been before you came,"
3867,THE TAVERN,"You asked me, and I answered, yes,"
3868,THE TAVERN,"No change, my dear, not even the name."
3869,THE TAVERN,
3870,THE TAVERN,"No change, except the people change,"
3871,THE TAVERN,"And change they do, I must confess."
3872,THE TAVERN,In truth a few alone remain
3873,THE TAVERN,Of those who lived here when I first
3874,THE TAVERN,"Entered the door there, most are strange."
3875,THE TAVERN,And as I rose much earlier
3876,THE TAVERN,"Than you arose, you may suppose"
3877,THE TAVERN,"I shall grow drowsy, yet who knows"
3878,THE TAVERN,"Before you do, and leave the stir"
3879,THE TAVERN,"The dancing, feasting, just to creep"
3880,THE TAVERN,Back for another night of sleep.
3881,THE TAVERN,I’d like so well to stay awake
3882,THE TAVERN,And watch the dancing for your sake.
3883,THE TAVERN,"It may be, though it scarce may be--"
3884,THE TAVERN,No one remained awake for me.
3885,THE TAVERN,
3886,THE TAVERN,You cannot fail to find the bed
3887,THE TAVERN,"When you are sleepy, but no doubt"
3888,THE TAVERN,It will be black with the light out.
3889,THE TAVERN,"Come dear, that sleep is loveliest"
3890,THE TAVERN,"Where side by side two lovers rest,"
3891,THE TAVERN,That sweetens sleep--it may be best!

3899,O SAEPE MECUM,
3900,O SAEPE MECUM,
3901,O SAEPE MECUM,Edward! you knew the city and you knew
3902,O SAEPE MECUM,"Where dancing and where music were,"
3903,O SAEPE MECUM,"And every hall and theatre,"
3904,O SAEPE MECUM,And every green purlieu
3905,O SAEPE MECUM,
3906,O SAEPE MECUM,Of gardens where beneath the vines and trees
3907,O SAEPE MECUM,One might sip beer and be consoled
3908,O SAEPE MECUM,"By music mixed with talk, behold"
3909,O SAEPE MECUM,The summer’s devotees
3910,O SAEPE MECUM,
3911,O SAEPE MECUM,"About the tables, idling June away."
3912,O SAEPE MECUM,"And you knew chicory and cress,"
3913,O SAEPE MECUM,With French or Mayonnaise could dress
3914,O SAEPE MECUM,"A salad, growing gay"
3915,O SAEPE MECUM,
3916,O SAEPE MECUM,"As you poured Burgundy or Rhenish wine,"
3917,O SAEPE MECUM,Or had a sirloin brought to see
3918,O SAEPE MECUM,"If it were ripe, the recipe"
3919,O SAEPE MECUM,"For broiling it, to dine"
3920,O SAEPE MECUM,
3921,O SAEPE MECUM,"Thereon in fitting state, the waiter took"
3922,O SAEPE MECUM,"And bowed in admiration, then"
3923,O SAEPE MECUM,You snapped your silver case again
3924,O SAEPE MECUM,And from the holders shook
3925,O SAEPE MECUM,"Such cigarettes as Turkish grandees smoke,"
3926,O SAEPE MECUM,"And blew the perfumed incense forth,"
3927,O SAEPE MECUM,"Descanting on our life, the worth"
3928,O SAEPE MECUM,"Of lawyers, noted folk:"
3929,O SAEPE MECUM,
3930,O SAEPE MECUM,"Of judges, politicians, governors,"
3931,O SAEPE MECUM,Until the dinner came at last.
3932,O SAEPE MECUM,And there amid the rich repast
3933,O SAEPE MECUM,We poor solicitors
3934,O SAEPE MECUM,
3935,O SAEPE MECUM,"Gloried in life, and ruddy faced would laugh"
3936,O SAEPE MECUM,"At any mishap, any fate"
3937,O SAEPE MECUM,"That we could fancy might await,"
3938,O SAEPE MECUM,And glorying would quaff
3939,O SAEPE MECUM,
3940,O SAEPE MECUM,"Incredible goblets of the quickening juice,"
3941,O SAEPE MECUM,"With blackest coffee topping all,"
3942,O SAEPE MECUM,And afterwards a cordial--
3943,O SAEPE MECUM,Nothing we could abuse
3944,O SAEPE MECUM,
3945,O SAEPE MECUM,"And nothing hurt us, Edward! It was well"
3946,O SAEPE MECUM,"We lived, I think, and memories stored:"
3947,O SAEPE MECUM,For now I am a little bored
3948,O SAEPE MECUM,With the invariable
3949,O SAEPE MECUM,
3950,O SAEPE MECUM,And settled round of nights and days wherein
3951,O SAEPE MECUM,"I must have sleep to work, and keep"
3952,O SAEPE MECUM,Abstemious to work and sleep--
3953,O SAEPE MECUM,While you long since have been
3954,O SAEPE MECUM,The tangled lion of a woman’s hair
3955,O SAEPE MECUM,"Who reads you novels and the news,"
3956,O SAEPE MECUM,"And mends you, tends you, even brews"
3957,O SAEPE MECUM,Your broth and gives you care
3958,O SAEPE MECUM,
3959,O SAEPE MECUM,In these dyspeptic mornings. As for me
3960,O SAEPE MECUM,"The cafés, gardens haunt me yet."
3961,O SAEPE MECUM,I go about as one who can’t forget
3962,O SAEPE MECUM,A dead felicity--
3963,O SAEPE MECUM,
3964,O SAEPE MECUM,"The Bismarck, Rector’s where I enter not--"
3965,O SAEPE MECUM,The music all is changed--and where
3966,O SAEPE MECUM,"No faces that we knew are there,"
3967,O SAEPE MECUM,And where we are forgot.

4009,MALACHY DEGAN,A judge who loved the game and whose decree

4065,MY DOG PONTO,"Great book on gravitation, here’s a thesis"
4066,MY DOG PONTO,"Upon the logos, of the word made man."
4067,MY DOG PONTO,Or if I say let’s talk about my soul--
4068,MY DOG PONTO,Since I have talked to yours in terms of meat--
4069,MY DOG PONTO,Which sails out like a spider on its thread
4070,MY DOG PONTO,"Through mathematics, music,--look at you"
4071,MY DOG PONTO,"You merely lie there with half open eye,"
4072,MY DOG PONTO,"And thump your tail quite feebly just because,"
4073,MY DOG PONTO,"And for no other reason save I’m talking,"
4074,MY DOG PONTO,"And I’m your master and you’re fond of me,"
4075,MY DOG PONTO,And through affection would no doubt be glad
4076,MY DOG PONTO,"To know what I am saying, as ’twere meat"
4077,MY DOG PONTO,I might be saying. But I know a way
4078,MY DOG PONTO,To make you howl for things not understood:
4079,MY DOG PONTO,It makes you howl to hear my new Victrola
4080,MY DOG PONTO,"With a Beethoven record, why is this?"
4081,MY DOG PONTO,Perhaps this is to you a maddening token
4082,MY DOG PONTO,"Of realms that lie above the realms of meat,"
4083,MY DOG PONTO,And torture you because they have suggestions
4084,MY DOG PONTO,Of things beyond you.
4085,MY DOG PONTO,
4086,MY DOG PONTO,"But in any case,"
4087,MY DOG PONTO,"Dear Ponto, if you were an infidel"
4088,MY DOG PONTO,“You might say “What’s harmonics? they’re a joke.”
4089,MY DOG PONTO,"“And who’s Spinoza, Newton, they are myths.”"
4090,MY DOG PONTO,"“And mathematics, music, can you eat them,”"
4091,MY DOG PONTO,“For what you cannot eat has no existence.”
4092,MY DOG PONTO,Deny them as you will these spheres of thought
4093,MY DOG PONTO,Lie as the steps of mountains over you.
4094,MY DOG PONTO,"They wait for you to gain them, you can find them"
4095,MY DOG PONTO,"By rising to them, then how real they are!"
4096,MY DOG PONTO,As real as scampering when I take a walk.
4097,MY DOG PONTO,But are they all? How do I know what spheres
4098,MY DOG PONTO,"Of life lie all around me and above me,"
4099,MY DOG PONTO,"Just waiting not for me, but till I climb"
4100,MY DOG PONTO,And rest awhile and take their meaning in.
4101,MY DOG PONTO,How do I know what hand plays a Victrola
4102,MY DOG PONTO,"With records greater than Beethoven’s song,"
4103,MY DOG PONTO,Which make me howl as piteously as you?
4104,MY DOG PONTO,But here again our minds meet on a level:
4105,MY DOG PONTO,I know no more than you do why I howl;
4106,MY DOG PONTO,"Nor what it is that makes me howl, nor why,"
4107,MY DOG PONTO,"Though not content with meat, I want to know,"
4108,MY DOG PONTO,And keep as all my own this higher music.
4109,MY DOG PONTO,
4110,MY DOG PONTO,
4111,MY DOG PONTO,
4112,MY DOG PONTO,
4113,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,THE GOSPEL OF MARK
4114,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4115,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4116,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,How long have you been waiting? Not so long?
4117,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,I’m glad of that. You found the place at once.
4118,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Well, there’s the Campus Martius, when you’re there"
4119,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"You see above this Collis Hortulorum,"
4120,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,A good place for two men like us to meet:
4121,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Here’s where luxurious souls have their abodes.
4122,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,That’s Sallust’s garden there. They do not care
4123,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,So much about us as some others do.
4124,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"There is a tolerance comes from being rich,"
4125,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,An urbane soul is fashioned by a villa.
4126,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Our faith is not to these a wicked thing,"
4127,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,A deadly superstition as some deem it.
4128,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"But Mark, my son, there’s Rome below you there--"
4129,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"What temples, arches, under the full moon!"
4130,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Here let us sit beside this chestnut tree,"
4131,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And while the soft wind blows out of the sea
4132,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Let’s finish up our talks. You must know all
4133,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Wherewith to write the story ere I die
4134,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Beneath the wrath of Nero. See that light,"
4135,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Faint like a little candle--I passed there.
4136,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"That’s one of our poor men, they make us lamps"
4137,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Wherewith to light the streets and Nero’s gardens.
4138,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,We shall be lamps they’ll wish to snuff in time.
4139,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,We met to-night at one Silvanus’ house.
4140,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And I was telling them about the night
4141,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"When in Gethsemane you followed Him,"
4142,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Having a cloth around your naked body.
4143,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"And how you laid hold on him, left the cloth"
4144,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And fled. But when you write this you can say
4145,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"“A certain young man,” leaving out your name,"
4146,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,You may not wish to have it known ’twas you
4147,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Who ran away, as I would like to hide"
4148,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"How I fell into sleep and failed to watch,"
4149,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And afterwards declared I knew Him not:
4150,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,But as for me omit no thing. The world
4151,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Will gain for seeing me rise out of weakness
4152,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"To strength, and out of fear to boldness. Time"
4153,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Has wrought his wonders in me, I am rock,"
4154,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Let hell beat on me, I shall stand from now!"
4155,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4156,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Then don’t forget the first man that he healed.
4157,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"There’s deep significance in this, my son,"
4158,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,That first of all he’d take an unclean spirit
4159,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And cast it out. Then second was my mother
4160,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Cured of her fever, just as you might say:"
4161,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Be rid of madness, things that tear and plague,"
4162,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Then cool you of the fever of vain life.
4163,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,But don’t forget to write how he would say
4164,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"“Tell no man of this,” say that and no more."
4165,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Though I may think he said it lest the crowds
4166,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"That followed him would take his strength for healing,"
4167,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"And leave no strength for words, let be and write"
4168,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,“Tell no man of this” simply. For you see
4169,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"These madmen quieted, these lepers cleaned"
4170,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Had soon to die, all now are dead, perhaps."
4171,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And with them ends their good. But what he said
4172,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Remains for generations yet to come, with power"
4173,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"To heal and heal. My son, preserve your notes,"
4174,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Of what I’ve told you, even above your life."
4175,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Make many copies lest one script be lost.
4176,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,I shall not to another tell it all
4177,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,As I have told it you.
4178,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4179,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,But as for me
4180,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,What merit have I that I saw and said
4181,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,“Thou art the Christ?” One sees the thing he sees.
4182,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,That is a matter of the eye--behold
4183,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,What is the eye? Is there an Eye Power which
4184,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Produces eyes, a primal source of seeing,"
4185,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"An ocean of beholding, as the ocean"
4186,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Makes rivers, streams and pools, so does this Power"
4187,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Make eyes? You take an egg and keep it warm
4188,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"About a day, then break the shell and look:"
4189,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,You’ll find dark spots on either side of what
4190,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Will be the head in time, these will be eyes"
4191,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"In season, but just now they cannot see,"
4192,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Although the Eye Power back of them can see
4193,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Both what they are and how to make them eyes
4194,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,By giving them its quality and strength.
4195,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And all the time while these dark spots emerge
4196,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"From yolk to eyes, this Rome is here no less,"
4197,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"This moon, these stars, this wonder! Take a child"
4198,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"It stares at flowers and tears them, or again"
4199,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"It claws the whiteness of its mother’s breast,"
4200,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Sees nothing but the things beneath its nose.
4201,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"The world around it lies here to be seen,"
4202,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And will be seen from boyhood on to age
4203,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"In different guises, aspects, richnesses"
4204,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"According to the man, for every man"
4205,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Sees different from his fellow. What’s an eye?
4206,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"I say not what’s an eye, but what is here"
4207,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,For eyes to see? What wonders in that sky
4208,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Beyond my eye! What living things concealed
4209,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Beneath my feet in grass or moss or slime,"
4210,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,As small to crickets as they are to us!
4211,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,For Nero at the Circus holds a ruby
4212,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Before his eye to give his eye more sight
4213,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,To see the games and tortures. So I say
4214,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,There was no merit in me when I said
4215,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,“Thou art the Christ.”
4216,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4217,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Let’s think of eyes this way:
4218,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,The lawyers said there’s nothing in this fellow.
4219,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,His family beheld no wonder in him.
4220,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Have Mary Magdalene and I invented
4221,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"These words, this story?--who are we to do so,--"
4222,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,A fallen woman and a fisherman!
4223,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Or did this happen? Did we see these things?
4224,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Did Mary see him risen and did I?
4225,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Were other eyes still dark spots on the yolk,"
4226,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And were our eyes full grown and did we see?
4227,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Is this a madman’s world where I can talk,"
4228,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And have you write for centuries to read
4229,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And play the fool with them? Or do all things
4230,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Of spirit, as of stars, of spring and growth"
4231,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Proceed in order, under law to ends?"
4232,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"No, Mark, my son, this is the truth, so write,"
4233,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Preserve this story taken from my lips.
4234,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,My work is almost done. Rome is the end
4235,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Of all my labors, I have faith The Eye"
4236,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Will give me other eyes for other worlds!
4237,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4238,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Why should I not believe this? Not all seasons
4239,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Are for unfolding. In the winter time
4240,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"You cannot see the miracle of birth,"
4241,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Of germinating seeds, of blossoming."
4242,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Why not then that one time for seeing Death
4243,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Go up like mist before the rising sun?
4244,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And in this single instance of our Lord
4245,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Arising from the grave, see all men rise,"
4246,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"And all men’s souls discovered in his soul,"
4247,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Their quality and essence, strength made clear?"
4248,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And why not I the seer of these things?
4249,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Why should there be another and not I?
4250,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And I declare to you that untold millions
4251,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,In centuries untold will live and die
4252,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"By these words which you write, as I have told them."
4253,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"And nation after nation will be moulded,"
4254,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"As heated wax is moulded, by these words."
4255,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And spirits in their inmost power will feel
4256,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Change and regeneration through them--well, what then?"
4257,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Do you say God is living, that this world,"
4258,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"These constellations, move by law, that all"
4259,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,This miracle of life and light is held
4260,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"In harmony, and that the soul of man"
4261,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Moves not in order, but that it’s allowed"
4262,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"To prove an anarch to itself, sole thing"
4263,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"That turns upon itself, sole thing that’s shown"
4264,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,The path that leads no whither? is allowed
4265,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,To feed on falsehood? that it’s allowed
4266,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"To wander lawless to its ruin, fooled"
4267,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"By what it craves, by what it feels, by eyes"
4268,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,That swear the truth of what they see? by words
4269,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Which you will write from words I have affirmed?
4270,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And do you say that Life shall prove the foe
4271,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Of life, and Law of law? Or do you say"
4272,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,The child’s eyes see reality which see
4273,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"The poppy blossoms or the mother’s breast,"
4274,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And this Rome and these stars do not exist
4275,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Because the child’s eyes cannot compass them,"
4276,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And get their image? Shall we trust our vision
4277,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Mounting to higher things, or only trust"
4278,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Those things which all have seen except the souls
4279,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Who have not soared, or risen to the gift"
4280,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Of seeing what seemed walking trees grow clear
4281,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"As men or angels? No, it cannot be."
4282,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Man’s soul, the chiefest flower of all we know,"
4283,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Is not the toy of Malice or of Sport.
4284,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"It is not set apart to be betrayed,"
4285,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Or gulled to its undoing, left to dash"
4286,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Its hopeless head against this rock’s exception,"
4287,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"No water for its thirst, no Life to feed it,"
4288,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"No law to guide it, though this universe"
4289,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Is under Law, no God to mark its steps,"
4290,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Except the God of worlds and suns and stars,"
4291,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Who loves it not, loves worlds and suns and stars,"
4292,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"And them alone, and leaves the soul to pass"
4293,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Unfathered--lets me have a madman’s dream
4294,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,And gives it such reality that I
4295,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Take fire and light the world, convincing eyes"
4296,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,Left foolish to believe. It cannot be....
4297,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4298,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,"Go write what I have told you, come what will"
4299,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,I’m going to the catacombs to pray.
4300,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4301,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4302,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4303,THE GOSPEL OF MARK,
4304,MARSYAS,MARSYAS
4305,MARSYAS,
4306,MARSYAS,
4307,MARSYAS,Pallas Athena in an hour of ease
4308,MARSYAS,"From guarding states and succoring the wise,"
4309,MARSYAS,Pressed wistfully her lips against a flute
4310,MARSYAS,Made by a Phrygian youth from resonant wood
4311,MARSYAS,Cut near Sangarius. Upon a bank
4312,MARSYAS,Made sweet by daisies and anemone
4313,MARSYAS,She sat with godly wisdom exercised
4314,MARSYAS,Blowing her breath against the stubborn tube
4315,MARSYAS,That it might answer and vibrate in song.
4316,MARSYAS,"But while she played, down-looking, she beheld"
4317,MARSYAS,"A serpent’s eyes, which by the water’s edge"
4318,MARSYAS,"Lay coiled among the reeds, as if aware"
4319,MARSYAS,Of the divinity that filled the place.
4320,MARSYAS,"Then Athena saw her image in the cove,"
4321,MARSYAS,"Where like a silver mirror, motionless"
4322,MARSYAS,"Sangarius lay, and seeing her own face"
4323,MARSYAS,"Thus suddenly, was stricken with surprise"
4324,MARSYAS,"Of her fair forehead wrinkled, and her lips"
4325,MARSYAS,Pursed and distorted as she strove to curb
4326,MARSYAS,"The resisting instrument. So with a smile,"
4327,MARSYAS,"A little laugh, which brought her beauty back,"
4328,MARSYAS,And gilded like a gradual burst of sun
4329,MARSYAS,The water where the charmed serpent lay
4330,MARSYAS,"Lifting his head up to the living warmth,"
4331,MARSYAS,"She threw the flute down, and Olympus way"
4332,MARSYAS,"Vanished, from sight."
4333,MARSYAS,
4334,MARSYAS,Marsyas all the while
4335,MARSYAS,Beneath an oak’s shade by the water’s edge
4336,MARSYAS,"Had drowsed voluptuously, and heard the notes,"
4337,MARSYAS,Dreaming some shepherd youth who watched his sheep
4338,MARSYAS,Upon a near-by hill which to the swale
4339,MARSYAS,"Sloped in luxuriance, upon a reed"
4340,MARSYAS,His idle fancies loosened from the stops.
4341,MARSYAS,"But when Athena passed him, since he heard"
4342,MARSYAS,"A roar of wings, as when a flock of quail"
4343,MARSYAS,"Up-fly the hunter’s step, he woke to find"
4344,MARSYAS,The forest silent and the music gone.
4345,MARSYAS,"Then straying toward the rushes, he espied"
4346,MARSYAS,"The flute upon the golden sands, and took it"
4347,MARSYAS,"And tried his lips upon it, where the lips"
4348,MARSYAS,"Of Pallas Athena left it fragrant, moist,"
4349,MARSYAS,"And with a soul, which to the artless breath"
4350,MARSYAS,Of the rude Satyr gave melodious speech.
4351,MARSYAS,So thinking that the music was his own
4352,MARSYAS,And that the flute was but a worthless wood
4353,MARSYAS,"Save that it made his genius manifest,"
4354,MARSYAS,And swollen with conceit Marsyas sent
4355,MARSYAS,"A word of challenge to the Delphic god,"
4356,MARSYAS,"Apollo of the cithara, for trial"
4357,MARSYAS,"Of skill in music, saying who should prove"
4358,MARSYAS,The victor might do with the other what
4359,MARSYAS,"Pleased him to do, and let the Muses judge."
4360,MARSYAS,
4361,MARSYAS,"But when Athena heard Apollo laugh,"
4362,MARSYAS,Where the nine Muses gossiped of the dare
4363,MARSYAS,"Which Marsyas uttered, for the lower meadows"
4364,MARSYAS,Of flowered Olympus whispered of the thing
4365,MARSYAS,"In jest and quip, and knowing that her soul"
4366,MARSYAS,"Still echoed in the flute, but would anon"
4367,MARSYAS,Fade from it as the perfume from a girdle
4368,MARSYAS,"Tinct by the touch of Aphrodite’s hand,"
4369,MARSYAS,Spoke to Apollo: “Grant a little time
4370,MARSYAS,Wherein the Satyr may improve his skill.”
4371,MARSYAS,To which the Muses nodded ’mid their smiles.
4372,MARSYAS,"But yet Apollo gave assent, though teased"
4373,MARSYAS,By reason of their chatter and the thought
4374,MARSYAS,Hid in Athena’s word that any respite
4375,MARSYAS,Granted the Satyr could prosper his success.
4376,MARSYAS,
4377,MARSYAS,Meanwhile Marsyas waited for the day
4378,MARSYAS,Appointed of Apollo. Near Sangarius
4379,MARSYAS,And through the woodlands tireless with the flute:
4380,MARSYAS,Sometimes in imitative harmony
4381,MARSYAS,"Mocking the sound of fluttering leaves, and now"
4382,MARSYAS,The musical winds that blow in early spring
4383,MARSYAS,Around a peak of dancing asphodel
4384,MARSYAS,"Where the sea warms them, and at other times"
4385,MARSYAS,The little waves that patter on the sands
4386,MARSYAS,Of old Sangarius rich in numerous flags.
4387,MARSYAS,And once he strove with music’s alchemy
4388,MARSYAS,To turn to sound the sunlight of the morn
4389,MARSYAS,Which fills the senses as illuminate dew
4390,MARSYAS,Quickens the ovule of the tiger-flower.
4391,MARSYAS,Again he sang the sorrow of his youth
4392,MARSYAS,When a wild nymph after one day of bliss
4393,MARSYAS,Fled him while sleeping. And again he beat
4394,MARSYAS,The rhythm lying at the root of life
4395,MARSYAS,Which marks the whirling planets. And Apollo
4396,MARSYAS,Hearing betimes a note of purest tone
4397,MARSYAS,"Fall like a star, betrayed his wonderment--"
4398,MARSYAS,Whereat the muses vexed him with their smiles
4399,MARSYAS,And whisperings to each other. But Apollo
4400,MARSYAS,"Could sense the Satyr’s waning skill, which dulled"
4401,MARSYAS,"With its employment, as Athena’s soul"
4402,MARSYAS,"Died from the flute, although the Satyr knew not"
4403,MARSYAS,Each day of waiting doomed him:
4404,MARSYAS,
4405,MARSYAS,Then at last
4406,MARSYAS,"The day dawned for the trial of their skill,"
4407,MARSYAS,And Marsyas came bearing the hollow flute--
4408,MARSYAS,For all had left it of Athena’s soul.
4409,MARSYAS,Then on Sangarius’ wooded banks the muses
4410,MARSYAS,"To judge assembled, fair, majestical."
4411,MARSYAS,"With arms entwined some close together stood,"
4412,MARSYAS,"Some half-reclined upon the flowery grass,"
4413,MARSYAS,But all bore in their eyes the light of mirth
4414,MARSYAS,"Suppressed, half-hidden. Then, for that Euterpe"
4415,MARSYAS,"Was mistress of the flute, since it was deemed"
4416,MARSYAS,Fair to the Satyr that the contest be
4417,MARSYAS,"Judged by the flute, gave signal to begin."
4418,MARSYAS,Whereat Apollo struck the cithara
4419,MARSYAS,"To test the strings, and all the wood was hushed,"
4420,MARSYAS,Awed by the magic of its harmony.
4421,MARSYAS,But when Marsyas blew upon the flute
4422,MARSYAS,A fear coursed through him as his wonder rose
4423,MARSYAS,Whether Apollo had bewitched its soul
4424,MARSYAS,"To such discordance, or its utterance,"
4425,MARSYAS,"Such as he knew it, when compared with the god’s"
4426,MARSYAS,Was so unmusical. Yet he dare not fail
4427,MARSYAS,"The contest, so they waged it to the end,"
4428,MARSYAS,While the sweet muses now grown pitiful
4429,MARSYAS,"No longer smiled, but turned their heads away"
4430,MARSYAS,"In sorrow for Marsyas, for his shame"
4431,MARSYAS,And for the fate to follow.
4432,MARSYAS,
4433,MARSYAS,So at last
4434,MARSYAS,With one accord the muses rose and looked
4435,MARSYAS,"With eyes significant upon Apollo,"
4436,MARSYAS,Who angered by the Satyr’s swollen pride
4437,MARSYAS,"And monstrous failure, had become a will"
4438,MARSYAS,"Of resolute retribution. But the muses,"
4439,MARSYAS,"Because they feel for those who trying lose,"
4440,MARSYAS,Even as a mother for her crippled son
4441,MARSYAS,"Whom the sound-footed distance in the race,"
4442,MARSYAS,Hastened away lest they behold the thing
4443,MARSYAS,That came to pass. And flinging far the flute
4444,MARSYAS,Marsyas shrieked and sank upon the earth.
4445,MARSYAS,
4446,MARSYAS,Whereat Apollo seized his wretched form
4447,MARSYAS,"And lifting him up, with strips of laurel bark"
4448,MARSYAS,Bound the poor Satyr to a rugged oak
4449,MARSYAS,"And flayed him alive, and took the Satyr’s skin"
4450,MARSYAS,"And hung it in a cave, and turned his blood"
4451,MARSYAS,"To water, whence the river Marsyas"
4452,MARSYAS,That from the cave flows onward to this day.

4459,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,
4460,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,This was the world: It was a house
4461,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,With a cool hallway end to end
4462,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Where buckets, pans and dippers hung,"
4463,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And coats that in the breezes swung;
4464,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And eaves in which ’twas good to browse
4465,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,On books stored in a musty box.
4466,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Along the walks were lilac boughs,"
4467,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And by the windows hollyhocks.
4468,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And there were fields down to the hills
4469,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Which marked the earth’s far boundary;
4470,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"A church-spire at the roadway’s bend,"
4471,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"And barns and cribs and twinkling mills,"
4472,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"And neighbor friends like Mrs. Gray,"
4473,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And endless days of dream and play.
4474,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"It was a world so guarded, safe,"
4475,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,So cherished by a God-watched sky
4476,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Seeing the summers come and pass,"
4477,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,A world so quiet it appeared
4478,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Like to the mimic world ensphered
4479,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,By witchery of the old field glass
4480,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Which from an uncle’s drawer I took
4481,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Upon the distant hills to look.
4482,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,You know not then that worlds not dead
4483,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Lie back of you and bide their chance
4484,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,To seize your world of ignorance:
4485,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,There was an opening in the ceiling
4486,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Above the kitchen where the man
4487,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Sat humming to himself at night
4488,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Amid the enshadowed candle-light,"
4489,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And played on his accordion
4490,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Happy, unconscious and alone."
4491,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,There full of mischief would I lie
4492,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"And watch him through the ceiling’s hole,"
4493,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"And laugh for thought of elfish tricks,"
4494,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Of whispering words or dropping sticks
4495,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,To fright his well contented soul.
4496,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Sometimes I think there is an eye
4497,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Which is not God’s that spies upon us;
4498,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,That other worlds may lie about us
4499,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Our fathers or our mothers lived,"
4500,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Where Forces lurk and laugh and wait.
4501,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,
4502,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Here then was my world’s fair estate--
4503,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,For so I knew it--could it be
4504,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Disturbed or wrecked? I never thought
4505,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"That change or loss could come to me,"
4506,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,With God above the church’s spire....
4507,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,
4508,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,But what are all these April dreams?
4509,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Less tangible the landscape seems;
4510,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"The windmills, barns and houses swim"
4511,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"In a sphered ether, wheeling, dim."
4512,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Red cattle on green meadows pass
4513,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Across a belt of bluest sky
4514,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Like objects in the old field glass.
4515,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,The chickens stalk about the yard
4516,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Like phantom things in my regard
4517,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And songs and cries and voices sound
4518,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Like muffled echoes from the ground.
4519,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Stones and dead sticks crawl and move;
4520,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And bones that through the winter lay
4521,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Something of living power betray.
4522,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"I sink in all things dizzily,"
4523,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Made one with nature, all I see,"
4524,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Until I have no way to prove
4525,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,My separate identity.
4526,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Yet death is what? Why, death is this:"
4527,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Something that comes but is far off.
4528,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,They worry sometimes for my cough.
4529,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"I know they watch me, know they cry,"
4530,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,But what can wreck my earth or sky?
4531,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,
4532,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,The doctor comes now every day
4533,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"And with my father sits and talks,"
4534,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Or stands about the garden walks.
4535,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,One day I hear them: “It appears
4536,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Sometimes in ten or twenty years
4537,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,As madness or paralysis.
4538,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Sometimes it passes, leaves a scar"
4539,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And never troubles one again.
4540,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,You say you had this in the war?
4541,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"It’s hit your boy as phthisis,"
4542,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Also I think he’s going blind.”
4543,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,I saw my father trembling wind
4544,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Some plucked grass round and round his hand.
4545,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"They noticed me, walked further on"
4546,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,And left me dreaming where I sat.
4547,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,
4548,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,Some years since that day now are gone.
4549,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"I have no world now, none but night."
4550,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,My father’s world lay back of mine
4551,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"And wrecked my world so guarded, safe,"
4552,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,So cherished by a God-watched sky
4553,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,"Which looked on summers rise and pass,"
4554,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,So like an image caught and held
4555,WORLDS BACK OF WORLDS,By witchery of the old field glass.

4615,I,"The substance of your being, if you stay"
4616,I,The impetus of life you will not learn
4617,I,The simples of salvation. Go pluck off
4618,I,A serpent from Alecto’s head and laugh
4619,I,Exhilarate with its poison. If you scoff
4620,I,You will perceive. You cannot love the staff
4621,I,You have not scorned. You cannot weigh the act
4622,I,"You have not lived, the fear you did not prove."
4623,I,Your soul was made to focus and extract
4624,I,"Through action every hatred, every love."

4667,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,APOLLO AT PHERÆ
4668,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4669,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4670,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Zeus envied Æsculapius that he healed
4671,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"The sick and brought the dead to life, and fain"
4672,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Would slay him. So the Cyclops brought Zeus lightning
4673,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,With which Zeus smote the healer. Then Apollo
4674,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Destroyed the Cyclops, grieving for his son."
4675,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And Clotho laughed to see the thread of fate
4676,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Slip by Atropos, woven in the cloth"
4677,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Of destiny. For had she cut the thread
4678,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Shot from the spindle, then a little trace"
4679,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Of scarlet, but no figures of despair"
4680,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Had marked the storied tapestry. So Apollo
4681,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Was doomed for punishment to tend the flocks
4682,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Of King Admetus, lord of Pheræ. Next"
4683,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Apollo met a mortal woman, daughter"
4684,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Of an old soldier, servitor of the gods"
4685,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And rich in land.
4686,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4687,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"He, sitting on a rock"
4688,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,That overlooked a green Thessalian field
4689,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Where grazed the flocks, clad in a leopard’s skin,"
4690,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"His crook beside him, dreamed of wide Olympus:"
4691,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"“This hour the muses dance, the Council sits"
4692,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And there is high debate, or Hera storms"
4693,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"For Zeus’ absence; there is life, and I"
4694,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Unknown, alone, a shepherd by this field"
4695,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Of pastoral pathos labor all the day.”
4696,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And then a step disturbed his revery;
4697,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And looking up he saw a slender maid
4698,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"White as gardenias, jonquil-haired, with eyes"
4699,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,As blue as Peneus when he meets the sea.
4700,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And an old weakness crept upon the god.
4701,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,For ever in his soul there shone the face
4702,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Of woman, like the face of Artemis,"
4703,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"His virgin sister, delicate and chaste;"
4704,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And to o’ercome such whiteness and reserve
4705,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Had been Apollo’s madness from his birth.
4706,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And this Chione, daughter of the soldier,"
4707,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Servitor of the gods and rich in land
4708,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,At once became his passion. So he rose
4709,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And to Chione spoke, and she, to him."
4710,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And then anon she saw the unkept curls
4711,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Sun-bleached, that touched his shoulders, then his breast,"
4712,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Smooth as her own, and then his arms, his hands"
4713,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"His shapely knees, his firm and pointed feet,"
4714,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And her eyes closed as stars beneath the dawn
4715,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And dawn rose in her cheeks. And the god knew
4716,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Her inmost thought.
4717,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4718,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"So all that day they played,"
4719,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Amid the wind-blown light of Thessaly.
4720,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"He wove her traps for crickets from the grass,"
4721,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And from the willow branches made her flutes;
4722,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"He caught her butterflies, and sang her runes"
4723,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Of living things, and how the earth and sea"
4724,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,From Erebus and Love sprang into being;
4725,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And how the sun, and the bright pageant of the stars"
4726,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Dance joyously to music. And Chione
4727,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Was dumb for happiness; and the day went by.
4728,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"But with the dusk there came a swooning languor,"
4729,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,All was forgotten save the shepherd’s face
4730,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Held close to hers, and round his moving curls"
4731,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,The circled splendor of the sickle moon--
4732,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Nor eyes, nor lips, only a golden blur."
4733,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And rousing she beheld the enshadowed field
4734,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Flockless and silent, and the shepherd gone."
4735,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Then through the night Chione weakly walked
4736,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And found at last her home.
4737,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4738,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,The light of day
4739,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Brought terror to Chione. Then she sought
4740,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And found Apollo where he sat before
4741,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And told him that her father, the old soldier,"
4742,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Was favored of Admetus, and would bring"
4743,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"The royal power against him, if he failed"
4744,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,The troth of wedlock. And Apollo mused
4745,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Upon his exile from Olympus’ throne,"
4746,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And Zeus’ wrath against him, that he slew"
4747,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"The Cyclops, and upon his shepherd state"
4748,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Tending Admetus’ flocks, and how unknown"
4749,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And weak he stood between these kingly hands
4750,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Of Zeus and of Admetus. And seeing her fair,"
4751,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"More fair in tears, he gave her his consent."
4752,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4753,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Next day Chione brought the god a robe
4754,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And sandals and a girdle. Thus arrayed
4755,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Chione took him to her father’s home
4756,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"The ancient soldier, servitor of the gods,"
4757,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And rich in land, and spoke of him as Acteus"
4758,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,A merchant from the city. Then the father
4759,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Gave thanks to Zeus and at the family board
4760,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Apollo supped, as one who would become"
4761,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Chione’s husband. So it came to pass.
4762,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,They walked together in the bridal train
4763,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Behind the perfumed torches.
4764,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4765,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,All the while
4766,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Zeus smiled to see Apollo’s punishment.
4767,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And Hera, who with woman’s subtlety,"
4768,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Knew that there shone within Apollo’s soul
4769,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"A face like to the face of Artemis,"
4770,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"His virgin sister, delicate and chaste,"
4771,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And to o’ercome such whiteness and reserve
4772,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Had been Apollo’s madness from his birth,"
4773,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Laughed freely with the muses as she said:
4774,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,“Thus is the masculine spirit ever caught
4775,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"By its own lure, let Zeus himself take heed"
4776,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Lest sometime he be snared.”
4777,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4778,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,So when Olympus
4779,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Grew dull, the gods for fun looked o’er the ramparts"
4780,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And spied upon Apollo at the board
4781,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,With all Chione’s family; or at night
4782,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Beside Chione and the little faces
4783,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Which every year increased. Or on Apollo
4784,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,About his bitter task of shepherding
4785,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,To win the bread for faded Chione
4786,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And for the children.
4787,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4788,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Thus the nine years passed.
4789,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Then Zeus, avenged, sent all the muses down"
4790,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"To bring Apollo back, and to Olympus"
4791,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Humbled and sorrowful he came again,"
4792,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"With wrinkles and a touch of whitened hair,"
4793,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And a lack-lustre eye, which all the art"
4794,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Of Aphrodite after many days
4795,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Could scarce remove.
4796,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4797,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,Then Chione told her father
4798,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,That Acteus was not a merchant from the city.
4799,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"“Too late,” she said, “I found he had deceived me"
4800,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,And masked his shepherd calling.”
4801,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,
4802,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,To which her father
4803,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"The ancient soldier, servitor of the gods"
4804,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"And rich in land: “Yea, daughter, he deceived you."
4805,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,"Now he has run away, abandoned you,"
4806,APOLLO AT PHERÆ,May the gods note it and avenge the wrong.”

4813,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4814,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"Steam Shovel Cut lies through a wood,"
4815,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the trestle’s at the end.
4816,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"And north are the lonely Fillmore Hills,"
4817,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And south the river’s bend.
4818,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4819,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,It’s Christmas day and the blue on the hill
4820,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Is flapped by a flying crow.
4821,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"And the steel of the railroad track is cold,"
4822,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the Cut is piled with snow.
4823,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4824,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,What is that there by the trestle’s end
4825,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Where the Cut slopes down to the slough?
4826,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,That’s Cora Williams lying there
4827,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,In her cloak of faded blue.
4828,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4829,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"Her skirt is red as a northern spy,"
4830,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And her mittens blackberry black.
4831,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And under her cotton underskirt
4832,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,There’s a green place on her back.
4833,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4834,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"Her little gray hat is over her brow,"
4835,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And covers a purple bruise.
4836,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,She had white stockings for her feet
4837,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the holes were in her shoes.
4838,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4839,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"Where did you meet Croak Carless, girl?"
4840,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And where did you start to booze?
4841,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"They saw you once at Rigdon’s place,"
4842,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And last at Sandy Hughes’.
4843,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4844,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,On the night that Jesus Christ was born
4845,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,You were drinking gin and beer.
4846,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,They saw you sitting on Carless’ knees
4847,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,As the midnight hour drew near.
4848,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4849,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"They saw you two start into the night,"
4850,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the night was cold and black.
4851,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And then they found you there by the bridge
4852,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,With the green bruise on your back.
4853,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4854,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Down through the dark to the Shovel Cut
4855,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,The two of you walked and sang.
4856,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,You were holding hands on the trestle bridge
4857,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,When the bell began to clang.
4858,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4859,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,’Twas back of the curve that the head-light shone
4860,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,So what was the use of eyes?
4861,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,The mad iron thing leaped on you there
4862,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,As you ran on the trestle ties.
4863,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4864,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,It rushed on you like a furious bull
4865,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,That charges a scarlet flag.
4866,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,The engineer looked long at the gauge
4867,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,As the fireman scraped the slag.
4868,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4869,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Croak Carless jumped and fell on a stone
4870,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the world to him was a blank.
4871,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,But the iron thing struck at your back
4872,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And doubled you down on the bank.
4873,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4874,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Croak Carless woke from a sleep like death
4875,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And found you covered with blood.
4876,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"He slinks to the river to wash his hands,"
4877,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,He runs to hide in the wood.
4878,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4879,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"He steals through thickets, hides in a barn,"
4880,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,He cowers where the corn’s in shock.
4881,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"But the posse catches Croak by noon,"
4882,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the jailer turns the lock.
4883,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4884,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"Croak Carless’ wife weeps at the bars,"
4885,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Croak weeps in a grated cell.
4886,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,They’ve mortgaged the farm for a lawyer’s fee
4887,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,To save Croak’s soul from hell.
4888,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4889,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,For the Coroner has a bat-like thing
4890,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,In a bottle safe in his room.
4891,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,It looks like a baby devil fish--
4892,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,It’s Cora Williams’ womb.
4893,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4894,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,A woman’s womb is a thing of doom
4895,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And winged with a fan-like mesh.
4896,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"And who was the father, they’re asking Croak,"
4897,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Of this bit of jelly flesh?
4898,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4899,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the doctors took an oath in the court
4900,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,That a sharp club did the deed.
4901,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the judge was a foe of the lawyer man
4902,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Croak Carless paid to plead.
4903,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4904,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"And Croak had talked too much in jail,"
4905,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And he trembled and testified
4906,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"To a woeful tangle of time and place,"
4907,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the jury thought he lied.
4908,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4909,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Croak Carless’ wife sobbed out in court
4910,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,As they twisted him out and in.
4911,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"For they made him swear he drank with the girl,"
4912,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And swear to his carnal sin.
4913,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4914,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,They stood him up on the gallow’s trap
4915,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And his voice was clear and low:
4916,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"If I killed Cora Williams, men,"
4917,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,My soul to hell should go.
4918,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4919,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"They sprang the trap, Croak Carless shot"
4920,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Like a wheat bag toward the floor.
4921,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And the doctors let his body hang
4922,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,Till his old heart beat no more.
4923,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4924,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,They let him alone to work and sweat
4925,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,For a wife’s and children’s ease.
4926,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,But they hung him up for a little beer
4927,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,With a woman on his knees.
4928,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4929,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"And he might have died in bed in a year,"
4930,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,For when they opened him up
4931,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"They found his heart was a played out pump,"
4932,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And leaked like a rusty cup.
4933,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4934,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"And a man can live as the church decrees,"
4935,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"Or dance in the way of vice,"
4936,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"A woman’s womb is a thing of doom,"
4937,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And life is the current price.
4938,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,
4939,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"’Tis a vampire bat, or the leather box"
4940,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,From which you rattle the dice.
4941,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,"’Tis an altar of doom, is a woman’s womb,"
4942,STEAM SHOVEL CUT,And man is the sacrifice.

4947,THE HOUSES,THE HOUSES
4948,THE HOUSES,
4949,THE HOUSES,
4950,THE HOUSES,"You wonder why I bought so many houses,"
4951,THE HOUSES,"Bought and repaired, built over home on house."
4952,THE HOUSES,"The first one was to make a home for Mary,"
4953,THE HOUSES,"And Frank and Bessie, for I had myself"
4954,THE HOUSES,"A settled home when I was boy and man,"
4955,THE HOUSES,"And knew the feeling of respect, content"
4956,THE HOUSES,Which comes of one familiar and continued
4957,THE HOUSES,Habitation for a boy who’s growing.
4958,THE HOUSES,"The first house, then, was poor enough, God knows!"
4959,THE HOUSES,A place that smelt in all the rooms of breath
4960,THE HOUSES,A sick man breathes into the very paper.
4961,THE HOUSES,The rat holes in the base boards had to be
4962,THE HOUSES,"Stopped up with plaster, all the floors were loose."
4963,THE HOUSES,Bricks lay awry upon the chimney tops.
4964,THE HOUSES,An old well with a windlass on the porch
4965,THE HOUSES,Made one remember typhoid all the time.
4966,THE HOUSES,"Some apple trees half-rotted, covered over"
4967,THE HOUSES,With water sprouts stood in a yard of weeds.
4968,THE HOUSES,A barn was at the yard’s end out of shape
4969,THE HOUSES,From leaning at an angle. All in all
4970,THE HOUSES,"The place was haunted, but it was the best"
4971,THE HOUSES,"I could afford just then, and naturally"
4972,THE HOUSES,She hated it and grumbled all the time.
4973,THE HOUSES,"A few years past, it seemed scarce two or three,"
4974,THE HOUSES,"And all the children married, went away."
4975,THE HOUSES,Just then I grew more prosperous and built over
4976,THE HOUSES,"The haunted house, and built a handsome barn,"
4977,THE HOUSES,"Cut out the apple trees, destroyed the weeds,"
4978,THE HOUSES,And put an iron fence around the yard.
4979,THE HOUSES,"Put bathrooms, running water in the house."
4980,THE HOUSES,"She jawed at me for doing this, and asked"
4981,THE HOUSES,Why did you wait until the children left?
4982,THE HOUSES,"Of course she knew, but blamed me just the same."
4983,THE HOUSES,And so we had no pleasure with this house.
4984,THE HOUSES,"She wanted larger rooms, and trees in front,"
4985,THE HOUSES,A sunny dining room--there was that porch
4986,THE HOUSES,"On which ours looked, and though I closed the well"
4987,THE HOUSES,She often wondered why we had not died
4988,THE HOUSES,Before I closed it.
4989,THE HOUSES,
4990,THE HOUSES,And about this time
4991,THE HOUSES,Our banker moved away and left his house
4992,THE HOUSES,For sale at public auction. I went down
4993,THE HOUSES,"Alone, not telling her, to look at it."
4994,THE HOUSES,Here was a house upon a stone foundation
4995,THE HOUSES,"Built of red brick, peaked roof of slate, three stories,"
4996,THE HOUSES,"Brick walks about the yard with plots of flowers,"
4997,THE HOUSES,A barn of brick--it was the very place!
4998,THE HOUSES,There now were grandchildren; and so I dreamed
4999,THE HOUSES,"How they would romp about this lovely yard,"
5000,THE HOUSES,Or play on rainy days in that wide garret.
5001,THE HOUSES,And so I bid and got the house at auction.
5002,THE HOUSES,But when I told her she was up in arms:
5003,THE HOUSES,The house would hold a family of ten!
5004,THE HOUSES,Besides the upper rooms were far too small:
5005,THE HOUSES,"What is a dining room, or huge drawing room"
5006,THE HOUSES,If you step out of bed against the wall?
5007,THE HOUSES,Then there’s that gully just below the barn
5008,THE HOUSES,"Breeding malaria, the banker’s family"
5009,THE HOUSES,Were sick year in and out--that’s why they sold it
5010,THE HOUSES,For anything at public sale. O fool!
5011,THE HOUSES,"Well, Mary came that summer with her children,"
5012,THE HOUSES,And my poor dream in part was realized.
5013,THE HOUSES,But Frank and Bessie moved to California
5014,THE HOUSES,And never saw the happiness I planned
5015,THE HOUSES,For them and for their children. Mary’s husband
5016,THE HOUSES,Disliked the house--his hatred was beginning.
5017,THE HOUSES,"Next summer Mary left him and divorced him,"
5018,THE HOUSES,And started out to earn her children’s bread.
5019,THE HOUSES,She didn’t come again.
5020,THE HOUSES,
5021,THE HOUSES,"And so it was true,"
5022,THE HOUSES,We didn’t need so large a house--we sold it
5023,THE HOUSES,And bought a cottage of six rooms; this time
5024,THE HOUSES,"She joined with me in picking out the house,"
5025,THE HOUSES,"But that was nothing, for no other house"
5026,THE HOUSES,Besides this one was up for sale just then.
5027,THE HOUSES,No sooner had we moved than she was full
5028,THE HOUSES,Of wounded memory and a mad regret:
5029,THE HOUSES,She saw what she had lost. These little rooms!
5030,THE HOUSES,This front fence almost jammed against the door!
5031,THE HOUSES,And stoves again instead of radiators!
5032,THE HOUSES,"No running water, only an old pump"
5033,THE HOUSES,Above the kitchen sink! And near the station--
5034,THE HOUSES,The bawling bussmen bothered her at night!
5035,THE HOUSES,The midnight train woke her unfailingly.
5036,THE HOUSES,And now she said our first house was all right
5037,THE HOUSES,"With this, or that corrected. We had blundered"
5038,THE HOUSES,In ever selling it and taking on
5039,THE HOUSES,Such luxury in the brick house. It had spoiled
5040,THE HOUSES,"Her taste for living in a house like this,"
5041,THE HOUSES,"With just a little yard, that hideous fence,"
5042,THE HOUSES,Which one could touch while standing in the door!
5043,THE HOUSES,"She said she could not breathe because of it,"
5044,THE HOUSES,And railed against her fate so that it brought
5045,THE HOUSES,The next step in my life of buying houses....
5046,THE HOUSES,
5047,THE HOUSES,"Dreams entered in my brain of fields and woods,"
5048,THE HOUSES,"A little lake perhaps, river or stream."
5049,THE HOUSES,There was a fad of buying farms just then.
5050,THE HOUSES,"I went to Michigan on other business,"
5051,THE HOUSES,"And there I saw one, bought it on the spot."
5052,THE HOUSES,"You see I had the passion as of drink,"
5053,THE HOUSES,And knew it as I ventured once again.
5054,THE HOUSES,But then there was the house upon the bluff!
5055,THE HOUSES,And there below it was the river! there
5056,THE HOUSES,Beeches and oaks down to the river’s edge!
5057,THE HOUSES,"A great white house all new, and apple trees,"
5058,THE HOUSES,A vineyard and a field of eighty acres.
5059,THE HOUSES,"Here will I sit, I said, upon my bluff"
5060,THE HOUSES,And watch the river. I will keep a man
5061,THE HOUSES,"To farm the place, and prune the vines and trees,"
5062,THE HOUSES,This is the place at last. But then I thought
5063,THE HOUSES,"What will she say? She wants a farm I know,"
5064,THE HOUSES,But will this suit her? So I sent for her.
5065,THE HOUSES,"And when she came she kissed me, she was glad,"
5066,THE HOUSES,"Commended my good judgment, loved the house,"
5067,THE HOUSES,"Went through the barn in rapture, stood beneath"
5068,THE HOUSES,"The windmill, which was near, to watch it pump."
5069,THE HOUSES,"Strolled down the wooded bluff, threw pebbles in"
5070,THE HOUSES,"The river where the swallows dipped and flew,"
5071,THE HOUSES,And gathered daisies by the river’s shore.
5072,THE HOUSES,"I sat down in the grass flushed through with joy,"
5073,THE HOUSES,"Like one who finds his haven, who has solved"
5074,THE HOUSES,"Laborious troubles, thinking of the rest"
5075,THE HOUSES,"I should take here--a man to run the place,"
5076,THE HOUSES,And months of summer recreation here!
5077,THE HOUSES,I told her what my plan was.
5078,THE HOUSES,
5079,THE HOUSES,"No, she said,"
5080,THE HOUSES,To own a farm is business. You should know
5081,THE HOUSES,By this time that you have no head for business.
5082,THE HOUSES,"I think you’ve shown some wisdom in this farm,"
5083,THE HOUSES,Or better you’ve had luck in buying it.
5084,THE HOUSES,Your other ventures buying houses were
5085,THE HOUSES,Enough to make you have distrust of self.
5086,THE HOUSES,Now that you’ve bought the farm to make it pay
5087,THE HOUSES,"Is what we have in hand, and you must work."
5088,THE HOUSES,"We’ll keep a man, but he cannot do all"
5089,THE HOUSES,"There is to do here, I will work and you"
5090,THE HOUSES,"Must work as well, the farm must pay, you know."
5091,THE HOUSES,I want the man to live with us in the house
5092,THE HOUSES,"So I can watch him, rout him out to work"
5093,THE HOUSES,At sun-up and keep watch upon his time.
5094,THE HOUSES,
5095,THE HOUSES,We’ll keep two rooms for our use. For the man
5096,THE HOUSES,"Must have a family, these single fellows"
5097,THE HOUSES,Are off too much at night and think too much
5098,THE HOUSES,In working hours of what they’ll do at night.
5099,THE HOUSES,
5100,THE HOUSES,Perhaps I am a weakling with my dream
5101,THE HOUSES,"Of buying houses, for I dream of joys"
5102,THE HOUSES,"And build my palaces, invite my joys"
5103,THE HOUSES,To enter and be glad. They never come!
5104,THE HOUSES,"She took the farm and ran it. It was business,"
5105,THE HOUSES,But business in disorder with a loss
5106,THE HOUSES,"For seed which did not sprout, and stock that died,"
5107,THE HOUSES,And glutted markets when the fruit was good.
5108,THE HOUSES,"I worked awhile, I fished once in the river,"
5109,THE HOUSES,I sat a few times on my wooded bluff--
5110,THE HOUSES,And then I fled and left her to the farm
5111,THE HOUSES,"To rule a single farmer who cut weeds,"
5112,THE HOUSES,"Abandoned weeds for plowing, left the plow"
5113,THE HOUSES,"To make a flower bed, following her whims"
5114,THE HOUSES,"Obedient, indifferent to results...."
5115,THE HOUSES,
5116,THE HOUSES,If you destroy a bird’s nest that’s the end.
5117,THE HOUSES,The nesting birds return to find the branch
5118,THE HOUSES,"Where they had builded with such patient care,"
5119,THE HOUSES,All naked of their work. They look and fly
5120,THE HOUSES,And think of what? But build no more that year.
5121,THE HOUSES,But if you take a twig and scratch the grains
5122,THE HOUSES,"About the ant hill, overturn their work,"
5123,THE HOUSES,"Stop up the door, the little folk begin"
5124,THE HOUSES,"To build again, clear out the ruined hall--"
5125,THE HOUSES,They cannot be discouraged like the birds.
5126,THE HOUSES,I think I am an ant--for even yet
5127,THE HOUSES,"I’m looking for a house, or better a home."
5128,THE HOUSES,There is that house walled in with earth--that’s sure--
5129,THE HOUSES,But if there is no house to fill my joy
5130,THE HOUSES,Why have I looked for houses all my life?

5138,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Over the dead lake
5139,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,And in a dusty sky
5140,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,The full moon is speared by the spire of the Baptist church;
5141,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Or now it hangs over the Groveland Hotel:
5142,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,I do not know whether it is over the spire
5143,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Or over the hotel.
5144,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,
5145,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,In a dusty sky the moon
5146,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Is the bottom of a copper kettle
5147,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Which cannot be scoured into brightness.
5148,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,The sky is a faded mosquito net

5155,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,At the pulpit under this spire
5156,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,With habitual regularity
5157,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Used to say:
5158,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Let us pray.
5159,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,"And the Rev. Albert McDugall, D.D."
5160,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,With habitual regularity
5161,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Used to preach
5162,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,On the wages of sin.

5165,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,"Ed Breen in Henry Hughes’ buffet,"
5166,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,There in the Groveland Hotel

5173,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,"When the Rev. Albert McDugall, D.D."
5174,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,"Was saying let us pray,"

5182,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,You lived to marry a second wife.
5183,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,"And you, Ed Breen, died in the thirties."
5184,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,But whether it be better to have ptomaine poisoning
5185,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,"From eating cold chicken,"
5186,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Or to drug yourself to death with bourbon
5187,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,I will ask the moon.
5188,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,For there is the moon
5189,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Like a German silver watch
5190,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,Under a grimy show case.
5191,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,I think it hangs as much over the hotel
5192,THE CHURCH AND THE HOTEL,As over the church.

5200,SUSIE,"Where did you go, pale Susie, after the day"
5201,SUSIE,You left the service of the boarding house?
5202,SUSIE,The night before we made carouse
5203,SUSIE,And danced the time away.
5204,SUSIE,
5205,SUSIE,We boys were in the kitchen and were drinking
5206,SUSIE,Small beer--you slapped the hands of us
5207,SUSIE,Who stroked your arms half amorous--
5208,SUSIE,"Where did you go, I’m thinking?"
5209,SUSIE,
5210,SUSIE,Medical students up at Hahnemann
5211,SUSIE,Hunt women on a Saturday night.
5212,SUSIE,"And sing, tell tales, and verse recite,"
5213,SUSIE,And rush the forbidden can.
5214,SUSIE,
5215,SUSIE,The paltry mistress made you pay for all
5216,SUSIE,"The fault of us, and packed you out of doors"
5217,SUSIE,"When you had scrubbed the floors,"
5218,SUSIE,And swept the entrance hall.
5219,SUSIE,
5220,SUSIE,I watched you in your faded cloak and hat
5221,SUSIE,With canvas bag walk towards the Grove.
5222,SUSIE,"Then something in my fancy hove,"
5223,SUSIE,Laughing I caught you at
5224,SUSIE,The doorway of the hotel on the street
5225,SUSIE,Where I had tracked you round from thirty-first.
5226,SUSIE,You laughed and cried and called me worst
5227,SUSIE,Of devils on two feet.
5228,SUSIE,
5229,SUSIE,There I had followed you and seized you when
5230,SUSIE,"You did not care what happened, so"
5231,SUSIE,"You fell into my hands, you know--"
5232,SUSIE,’Tis twenty years since then.
5233,SUSIE,
5234,SUSIE,"I never saw you after that, nor heard"
5235,SUSIE,In all this city aught of you.
5236,SUSIE,"You vanished like a blot of dew,"
5237,SUSIE,Or ashen hued seed bird.
5238,SUSIE,
5239,SUSIE,I wonder if you wed a red bull-throat
5240,SUSIE,"Who ran a rivet hammer, drove a truck,"
5241,SUSIE,Bore many children or worse luck
5242,SUSIE,Went where the drift weeds float....

5247,HAVING HIS WAY,HAVING HIS WAY
5248,HAVING HIS WAY,
5249,HAVING HIS WAY,
5250,HAVING HIS WAY,"We parted at the Union Station,"
5251,HAVING HIS WAY,"Tom Hall and I,"
5252,HAVING HIS WAY,Two boys in the early twenties
5253,HAVING HIS WAY,"Fresh from the quiet of fields,"
5254,HAVING HIS WAY,And the sleepy silence of village life.
5255,HAVING HIS WAY,"And we stepped into Adams Street,"
5256,HAVING HIS WAY,"Noisy from trucks and rattling cars,"
5257,HAVING HIS WAY,And babbling multitudes.
5258,HAVING HIS WAY,"He with his great invention,"
5259,HAVING HIS WAY,"And I with my translation of Homer,"
5260,HAVING HIS WAY,And the books of Rousseau and Marx.
5261,HAVING HIS WAY,
5262,HAVING HIS WAY,And he went his way
5263,HAVING HIS WAY,To sell his great invention.
5264,HAVING HIS WAY,And I in the village glory
5265,HAVING HIS WAY,"Of clothes ill-fitting, timid, sensitive"
5266,HAVING HIS WAY,"And proud, a little learned, so zealous"
5267,HAVING HIS WAY,For the weal of the world
5268,HAVING HIS WAY,"Came to your chateau palace near the Drive,"
5269,HAVING HIS WAY,"To you my friend, my queenly cousin,"
5270,HAVING HIS WAY,For a little visit before I entered
5271,HAVING HIS WAY,Upon the city’s life.
5272,HAVING HIS WAY,"You looked me over with calm Egyptian eyes,"
5273,HAVING HIS WAY,And put me at ease with your lovely smile.
5274,HAVING HIS WAY,And there was about you the calm of desert air in Nevada
5275,HAVING HIS WAY,That made me forget myself.
5276,HAVING HIS WAY,"Yet you began to guide me with subtlest words,"
5277,HAVING HIS WAY,"And to mould me with delicate hands,"
5278,HAVING HIS WAY,"As one might smooth a rumpled collar,"
5279,HAVING HIS WAY,"Or fasten a loosened scarf,"
5280,HAVING HIS WAY,Or lift to place a strand of hair
5281,HAVING HIS WAY,Of one beloved who thrills to the touch.
5282,HAVING HIS WAY,Even with closed eyes you saw everything
5283,HAVING HIS WAY,"Of harmony, or form, or hue."
5284,HAVING HIS WAY,There were silver strings in your little ears
5285,HAVING HIS WAY,"Which caught the tone pictures of sounds,"
5286,HAVING HIS WAY,And the intonations and sonorities of voices;
5287,HAVING HIS WAY,Which trembled to the barbarities of unmelodic words.
5288,HAVING HIS WAY,"And there as you saw and heard me,"
5289,HAVING HIS WAY,"(I knew it at once,)"
5290,HAVING HIS WAY,You took me for your piece of bronze in the rough
5291,HAVING HIS WAY,To be made under your hands
5292,HAVING HIS WAY,"Your triumph, your work, your creation"
5293,HAVING HIS WAY,In the world where you ruled as queen.
5294,HAVING HIS WAY,You would see me as finished art
5295,HAVING HIS WAY,Move before admiring eyes
5296,HAVING HIS WAY,"Where music is and richness,"
5297,HAVING HIS WAY,And where poverty and struggle
5298,HAVING HIS WAY,And sacrifice and failure are forgotten.
5299,HAVING HIS WAY,
5300,HAVING HIS WAY,That was the cousin you meant me to be.
5301,HAVING HIS WAY,And in a few nights
5302,HAVING HIS WAY,There was an evening dress and fine linen
5303,HAVING HIS WAY,And an opera hat and cloak
5304,HAVING HIS WAY,"Laid out for me in my snow white room,"
5305,HAVING HIS WAY,And a valet came to help me.
5306,HAVING HIS WAY,For we were to see Carmen together--
5307,HAVING HIS WAY,You and I in a box.
5308,HAVING HIS WAY,"You the queen,"
5309,HAVING HIS WAY,And I a genius from the country
5310,HAVING HIS WAY,Of whom the word had gone the rounds:
5311,HAVING HIS WAY,"A translator of Homer,"
5312,HAVING HIS WAY,"And a dreamer of revolutions,"
5313,HAVING HIS WAY,"Her cousin, you know!"
5314,HAVING HIS WAY,
5315,HAVING HIS WAY,I was pale from fear and pride
5316,HAVING HIS WAY,As I entered the box with you.
5317,HAVING HIS WAY,I felt I was wronging my dreams
5318,HAVING HIS WAY,And apostatizing all I had dreamed
5319,HAVING HIS WAY,To be in this box with you.
5320,HAVING HIS WAY,And a sullen hatred of everything:
5321,HAVING HIS WAY,"The mass of color, the faint perfumes,"
5322,HAVING HIS WAY,"The lights, the jewels, the dazzling breasts"
5323,HAVING HIS WAY,Of the queens in the boxes angered me.
5324,HAVING HIS WAY,"And everyone was smiling, and everyone was leveling"
5325,HAVING HIS WAY,"Opera glasses, sometimes at me,"
5326,HAVING HIS WAY,A translator of Homer
5327,HAVING HIS WAY,And a dreamer of socialism.
5328,HAVING HIS WAY,And there like a fool I sat and thought
5329,HAVING HIS WAY,Of the cold without and the beggar man
5330,HAVING HIS WAY,Who stood at your carriage as we alighted.
5331,HAVING HIS WAY,
5332,HAVING HIS WAY,And when the music arose at last
5333,HAVING HIS WAY,A sort of madness whirled in my brain.
5334,HAVING HIS WAY,For what was this Carmen thing
5335,HAVING HIS WAY,But subtle wickedness and cruel lust
5336,HAVING HIS WAY,"And hardest heathenism,"
5337,HAVING HIS WAY,"And delight that seeks its own,"
5338,HAVING HIS WAY,"In a setting of bloody voluptuousness,"
5339,HAVING HIS WAY,"Fiendish caprice and faithlessness,"
5340,HAVING HIS WAY,In music through which a pagan soul
5341,HAVING HIS WAY,Had sensed and voiced it all?
5342,HAVING HIS WAY,Till at least (I almost shrieked at this)
5343,HAVING HIS WAY,Don Jose in his amorous madness
5344,HAVING HIS WAY,Plunged a knife in the back of the whore he loved
5345,HAVING HIS WAY,To the growl of horns and moan of viols....
5346,HAVING HIS WAY,
5347,HAVING HIS WAY,And you sat through it all
5348,HAVING HIS WAY,Like a firefly on a vine leaf
5349,HAVING HIS WAY,"Suspiring in all your body,"
5350,HAVING HIS WAY,"And gazing with calm Egyptian eyes,"
5351,HAVING HIS WAY,Or turning to me as if you would know
5352,HAVING HIS WAY,If the poison was in my blood....
5353,HAVING HIS WAY,But I was immune:
5354,HAVING HIS WAY,"Democracy seemed too glorious,"
5355,HAVING HIS WAY,"And the cause of the poor too just,"
5356,HAVING HIS WAY,And fair sweet love of men and women
5357,HAVING HIS WAY,"So worth the cost to gain and keep,"
5358,HAVING HIS WAY,And honest bread too sweet--
5359,HAVING HIS WAY,I was immune....
5360,HAVING HIS WAY,And I scarcely saw the fair slim girl
5361,HAVING HIS WAY,To whom you introduced me.
5362,HAVING HIS WAY,And I scarcely heard what you said in the carriage
5363,HAVING HIS WAY,About her countless riches.
5364,HAVING HIS WAY,And I scarcely heard your words of praise
5365,HAVING HIS WAY,"That I looked like a prince,"
5366,HAVING HIS WAY,"And that you meant to help me,"
5367,HAVING HIS WAY,And do by me what your husband would do
5368,HAVING HIS WAY,"If he were living,"
5369,HAVING HIS WAY,And lift me along to a place in life
5370,HAVING HIS WAY,"Where power and riches are,"
5371,HAVING HIS WAY,"And beauty is and music,"
5372,HAVING HIS WAY,And where struggle and sacrifice are forgotten.
5373,HAVING HIS WAY,
5374,HAVING HIS WAY,And when I did not answer you thought
5375,HAVING HIS WAY,I sat abashed by your side.
5376,HAVING HIS WAY,Instead in my mind were running
5377,HAVING HIS WAY,"The notes to Queen Mab,"
5378,HAVING HIS WAY,And bits of Greek.
5379,HAVING HIS WAY,"I did this to stifle my wrath,"
5380,HAVING HIS WAY,"And to forget the cage you were luring me into,"
5381,HAVING HIS WAY,"And the poison you were offering me,"
5382,HAVING HIS WAY,And the cause of Truth!
5383,HAVING HIS WAY,And hiding my wrath in a day or two
5384,HAVING HIS WAY,"I left you saying I would return,"
5385,HAVING HIS WAY,But I never returned.
5386,HAVING HIS WAY,
5387,HAVING HIS WAY,"Instead I went where the youths were thinking,"
5388,HAVING HIS WAY,"Painting and writing,"
5389,HAVING HIS WAY,"And talking of the revolution,"
5390,HAVING HIS WAY,And the glorious day to come.
5391,HAVING HIS WAY,And I was happy even though
5392,HAVING HIS WAY,They sent my great translation back
5393,HAVING HIS WAY,As poor and amateurish.
5394,HAVING HIS WAY,For the years of youth were long ahead
5395,HAVING HIS WAY,There was time to try again....
5396,HAVING HIS WAY,
5397,HAVING HIS WAY,Then Margaret’s stepmother
5398,HAVING HIS WAY,"Drove her from home, and she came to the city"
5399,HAVING HIS WAY,"Crying in her loneliness and destitution,"
5400,HAVING HIS WAY,Suffering from her lame hip.
5401,HAVING HIS WAY,"And even these were happy days,"
5402,HAVING HIS WAY,"For I loved her for her sorrows,"
5403,HAVING HIS WAY,I loved her for her lameness.
5404,HAVING HIS WAY,It was all transfigured through my love
5405,HAVING HIS WAY,"For democracy and sacrifice,"
5406,HAVING HIS WAY,And the sweetness of honest bread.
5407,HAVING HIS WAY,"And it was like taking the sacrament, our marriage."
5408,HAVING HIS WAY,And there in our little flat far out
5409,HAVING HIS WAY,On Robey Street I toiled at writing
5410,HAVING HIS WAY,"While she went about so lame,"
5411,HAVING HIS WAY,"Trying to keep the house for me,"
5412,HAVING HIS WAY,And to clear away the disorders
5413,HAVING HIS WAY,Which piled about her constantly
5414,HAVING HIS WAY,And were never cleared away....
5415,HAVING HIS WAY,
5416,HAVING HIS WAY,"And is it not strange that to-day,"
5417,HAVING HIS WAY,After the lapse of ten years
5418,HAVING HIS WAY,These two things happen within an hour?
5419,HAVING HIS WAY,Your letter from Rome arrived--
5420,HAVING HIS WAY,"For though I scorned your life and love,"
5421,HAVING HIS WAY,"And went my way,"
5422,HAVING HIS WAY,"You write me still it seems,"
5423,HAVING HIS WAY,"Not to wound my fallen state,"
5424,HAVING HIS WAY,Nor to show me what my life had been
5425,HAVING HIS WAY,If I had heeded you.
5426,HAVING HIS WAY,But just in the continuous sunshine
5427,HAVING HIS WAY,Of noble friendship to show me
5428,HAVING HIS WAY,I am sometimes in your thought.
5429,HAVING HIS WAY,And scarcely had your letter come
5430,HAVING HIS WAY,When Tom Hall crept up the creaking stairs
5431,HAVING HIS WAY,Dragging his feet with the help of a cane--
5432,HAVING HIS WAY,He is rich and came to help me.
5433,HAVING HIS WAY,And Tom Hall had his way as well:
5434,HAVING HIS WAY,"He hated marriage and went the rounds,"
5435,HAVING HIS WAY,Wherever a pretty face allured.
5436,HAVING HIS WAY,And now he is sick and dragging his feet.
5437,HAVING HIS WAY,And here am I at a writing desk:
5438,HAVING HIS WAY,I’m cap and bells for the Daily Globe
5439,HAVING HIS WAY,And my grind is a column a day.
5440,HAVING HIS WAY,"You see it comes to this, dear queen:"
5441,HAVING HIS WAY,Can a man or woman alive escape
5442,HAVING HIS WAY,"The granite’s edges or ditch’s mire,"
5443,HAVING HIS WAY,"The thorny thickets or marsh’s gas,"
5444,HAVING HIS WAY,Or the traps one thinks would never be set
5445,HAVING HIS WAY,Except for the fox or wolf?....
5446,HAVING HIS WAY,And here is Margaret down with a cough
5447,HAVING HIS WAY,Never to rise from her bed again.
5448,HAVING HIS WAY,"And I sit by at my task of jokes,"
5449,HAVING HIS WAY,"And I stop to read your letter again,"
5450,HAVING HIS WAY,"And wonder why life has never caught you,"
5451,HAVING HIS WAY,And why you are laughing there in Rome
5452,HAVING HIS WAY,Where you dine with happy friends;
5453,HAVING HIS WAY,Or tramp the thickets around the ruins
5454,HAVING HIS WAY,Of the Baths of Caracalla--
5455,HAVING HIS WAY,I see the platforms and dizzy arches
5456,HAVING HIS WAY,Under a sky of Italy.
5457,HAVING HIS WAY,It’s cloudy here and the elevated
5458,HAVING HIS WAY,Rattles and roars beneath my window.
5459,HAVING HIS WAY,You’re picking flowers while it’s winter here.
5460,HAVING HIS WAY,I read these things in your letter and wonder
5461,HAVING HIS WAY,Is the asp at your breast in spite of laughter?
5462,HAVING HIS WAY,Or when is the asp to sting you?
5463,HAVING HIS WAY,
5464,HAVING HIS WAY,
5465,HAVING HIS WAY,
5466,HAVING HIS WAY,
5467,THE ASP,THE ASP
5468,THE ASP,
5469,THE ASP,
5470,THE ASP,As the train rushed on
5471,THE ASP,"The days of our youth swept through me,"
5472,THE ASP,As if they were brought to life by a sort of friction.
5473,THE ASP,I thought of how madly you laughed
5474,THE ASP,When we played at blindman’s buff with the Miller girls;
5475,THE ASP,"And of the May baskets we made together,"
5476,THE ASP,And hung as we rang the bell and ran.
5477,THE ASP,And of our games in the first spring days
5478,THE ASP,When we stole from house to house.
5479,THE ASP,And the children were shouting
5480,THE ASP,And the April moon was new.
5481,THE ASP,And the smell of burning leaves
5482,THE ASP,And the first tulips filled us with such ecstasy.
5483,THE ASP,"We laughed, we shouted, we leaped for joy."
5484,THE ASP,"We ran like mad through the rooms,"
5485,THE ASP,And we went to bed at last
5486,THE ASP,"Laughing and gasping,"
5487,THE ASP,"And lay looking at the moon through the leafless boughs,"
5488,THE ASP,"And fell to sleep with joyous hearts,"
5489,THE ASP,"Thinking of to-morrow,"
5490,THE ASP,"And the days and days to come for play,"
5491,THE ASP,"And the summer to come,"
5492,THE ASP,"And all the mad raptures of school at an end,"
5493,THE ASP,"And no death, and no end"
5494,THE ASP,"Of the love of father and mother,"
5495,THE ASP,And the home we loved.
5496,THE ASP,
5497,THE ASP,And here it was spring again--
5498,THE ASP,But such a spring!
5499,THE ASP,At the end of such years and years
5500,THE ASP,"And births and births and spheres and spheres of life,"
5501,THE ASP,Each like a life or a world of its own
5502,THE ASP,"With its friends, its own completeness, its rounded end."
5503,THE ASP,And back of them all
5504,THE ASP,"Our old home forgotten,"
5505,THE ASP,"Our father and mother gone,"
5506,THE ASP,And back of this spring that ended world of ours
5507,THE ASP,Wherein we parted
5508,THE ASP,Grown misty too!
5509,THE ASP,And as the train rushed on
5510,THE ASP,And the hour of meeting you neared
5511,THE ASP,"I was thrilled with gladness, thrilled with fear."
5512,THE ASP,"And now the station was Herkimer,"
5513,THE ASP,"And now it was Amsterdam,"
5514,THE ASP,"And now it was Albany,"
5515,THE ASP,And then Poughkeepsie on the Hudson.
5516,THE ASP,"And I looked from the car to the passing scene,"
5517,THE ASP,And back to the car again.
5518,THE ASP,Or I turned in my seat
5519,THE ASP,"Or took up my book and laid it down,"
5520,THE ASP,"Or fastened my bag for the hundredth time,"
5521,THE ASP,"Or straightened my cloak on the seat,"
5522,THE ASP,And waited and waited.
5523,THE ASP,For I had a story to tell you
5524,THE ASP,That I could not wait to tell.
5525,THE ASP,"I was traveling a thousand miles to tell you,"
5526,THE ASP,"And to get your advice, to have your solace,"
5527,THE ASP,"To look in your eyes again,"
5528,THE ASP,"And to feel in spite of springs that were gone,"
5529,THE ASP,"And our old home, and father and mother gone"
5530,THE ASP,There was an arm in the world for me to lean on.
5531,THE ASP,
5532,THE ASP,And the train rushed on
5533,THE ASP,Bringing me nearer to you.
5534,THE ASP,And the tears welled up to my eyes
5535,THE ASP,As I wondered why life had mangled me so:
5536,THE ASP,Why the man I loved at first and hated afterward
5537,THE ASP,"Had died that tragic death,"
5538,THE ASP,"Leaving me with memories of that love,"
5539,THE ASP,And such agony for that hate.
5540,THE ASP,And why as a sort of Empress Eugenia
5541,THE ASP,"The world turned on me when I fell,"
5542,THE ASP,And the little power I had departed.
5543,THE ASP,And why in spite of my aspiration
5544,THE ASP,"I had run into such disgust,"
5545,THE ASP,"Such overthrow of my work,"
5546,THE ASP,"Such undoing of myself,"
5547,THE ASP,Such spiritual wreck and shame!
5548,THE ASP,And to think of what had done it:
5549,THE ASP,"My search for love, my struggle for excellence--"
5550,THE ASP,These things alone!
5551,THE ASP,"I had married this second man for love,"
5552,THE ASP,And because I believed in him
5553,THE ASP,"As a man of power, a man of thought,"
5554,THE ASP,A man who loved me.
5555,THE ASP,And hoping through him to retrieve my life
5556,THE ASP,From the smut of the man I married first.
5557,THE ASP,But I found my very soul deceived:
5558,THE ASP,"He was just a violent visionary,"
5559,THE ASP,"A frothing fool,"
5560,THE ASP,"A spendthrift, coward, hedonist."
5561,THE ASP,And there I was tied to him.
5562,THE ASP,And carrying his child while finding him out.
5563,THE ASP,So I used to stand with my face to the wall
5564,THE ASP,And choke my mouth with a handkerchief
5565,THE ASP,To keep from crying out.
5566,THE ASP,For I knew if a whimper passed my lips
5567,THE ASP,"I should fall and roll on the floor with madness,"
5568,THE ASP,And beat my head on the floor.
5569,THE ASP,
5570,THE ASP,So when the train rolled into the station
5571,THE ASP,"A sickness, a weakness came over me."
5572,THE ASP,I had spent myself in expectation.
5573,THE ASP,"And now that I was about to see you,"
5574,THE ASP,"The thought of the vainness of seeing you,"
5575,THE ASP,"And the thought that you could not help me,"
5576,THE ASP,"Though I had traveled these thousand miles,"
5577,THE ASP,"Made me wish to fly, to hide."
5578,THE ASP,"So I stepped from the train in a kind of daze,"
5579,THE ASP,And scarcely felt your kiss.
5580,THE ASP,"It seemed relaxed, so faint."
5581,THE ASP,And your voice was weak.
5582,THE ASP,And your eyes were dim and dry.
5583,THE ASP,
5584,THE ASP,And there in the cab as we drove to the Park
5585,THE ASP,I was still in a daze
5586,THE ASP,Talking of May baskets
5587,THE ASP,"And blindman’s buff,"
5588,THE ASP,"And laughing, for one always laughs"
5589,THE ASP,When the moment is worst.
5590,THE ASP,And so it was I did not really see you.
5591,THE ASP,But when we began to walk
5592,THE ASP,Things about you began to limn themselves:
5593,THE ASP,Your shoulders seemed a little bent.
5594,THE ASP,There were streaks of snow on your temples.
5595,THE ASP,And you were quiet with the terrible quietness
5596,THE ASP,Of understanding of life.
5597,THE ASP,"And the old wit I knew,"
5598,THE ASP,"And the glad defiance of fate,"
5599,THE ASP,"And the light in your eyes,"
5600,THE ASP,And the musical laugh
5601,THE ASP,All were gone.
5602,THE ASP,Perhaps the daily grind of Cap and Bells
5603,THE ASP,"Had sapped you, dear."
5604,THE ASP,But when I looked at your hand on your cane
5605,THE ASP,"And saw how white and slim it was,"
5606,THE ASP,"And how it trembled, I knew"
5607,THE ASP,"You were not the giant man of old,"
5608,THE ASP,"Though you said you were gaining strength again,"
5609,THE ASP,And I could lean on your arm.
5610,THE ASP,
5611,THE ASP,"Well, then I told you all:"
5612,THE ASP,How my search for love had fooled me again;
5613,THE ASP,And how this beast had wronged and robbed me;
5614,THE ASP,"And how he stood in his paranoiac rages,"
5615,THE ASP,And compared himself to Christ.
5616,THE ASP,"But when I began to speak of the child,"
5617,THE ASP,"What a darling girl she was,"
5618,THE ASP,You sank in a seat and said: “No more--
5619,THE ASP,I didn’t think I was weak as this--
5620,THE ASP,"You mustn’t tell me another thing,"
5621,THE ASP,"Not now, not just now.”"
5622,THE ASP,"Then I saw, what Time had done,"
5623,THE ASP,And I saw that you could not help me.
5624,THE ASP,"And the next day and the next day,"
5625,THE ASP,"When I did not see you,"
5626,THE ASP,"And weeks passed by and I scarcely saw you,"
5627,THE ASP,"And I scarcely saw you again,"
5628,THE ASP,Though I had come a thousand miles
5629,THE ASP,"To lean on your arm,"
5630,THE ASP,"It grew in my mind that you despised me,"
5631,THE ASP,"Or that you were indifferent to my lot,"
5632,THE ASP,Or at least that I was a wounded thing
5633,THE ASP,You could not bear to see.
5634,THE ASP,"Till at last, though I knew"
5635,THE ASP,That my way was clear: there was nothing to do
5636,THE ASP,"But to fly with my child,"
5637,THE ASP,"And leave him forever,"
5638,THE ASP,"And endure great loneliness forever, if need be,"
5639,THE ASP,"And whatever shame there was,"
5640,THE ASP,"For the sake of my soul’s honor,"
5641,THE ASP,"Which only myself could save,"
5642,THE ASP,And you could save not at all.
5643,THE ASP,"Though I knew, I say, that my way was clear,"
5644,THE ASP,"And I needed your help not at all,"
5645,THE ASP,Still in a kind of madness
5646,THE ASP,"I began to reproach you for not helping me,"
5647,THE ASP,And for abandoning me to my fate.
5648,THE ASP,As a sick child will cry and blame its mother
5649,THE ASP,When it is not healed at once.
5650,THE ASP,
5651,THE ASP,And that was the mood he found me in
5652,THE ASP,When he came with a smile and honey words.
5653,THE ASP,"Well, I fell in his arms, and here I am"
5654,THE ASP,"Plunged up to the mouth in spiritual muck,"
5655,THE ASP,And what life is left for me now?
5656,THE ASP,How can I go on with life?
5657,THE ASP,"For he hates me now as a humbled thing,"
5658,THE ASP,He has broken my pride and he hates me now.
5659,THE ASP,"And he roars and curses about the house,"
5660,THE ASP,"And yells at our little girl when she cries,"
5661,THE ASP,And stands with his hands outstretched and says
5662,THE ASP,That his fate is worse than Christ’s.
5663,THE ASP,"And I tremble and rustle around like a fallen leaf,"
5664,THE ASP,And neither laugh nor cry nor return him a word....
5665,THE ASP,
5666,THE ASP,"For you know there’s a spring,"
5667,THE ASP,"And you know there’s a fire,"
5668,THE ASP,To burn dead leaves.
5669,THE ASP,And after the ashes
5670,THE ASP,There’s a spirit given a chance!

5678,THE FAMILY,We were three larks in the same nest.
5679,THE FAMILY,All spring the wind blew from the west.
5680,THE FAMILY,"We chirped beneath the enshadowing wheat,"
5681,THE FAMILY,"It grew to green, it grew to gold."
5682,THE FAMILY,Our mother’s voice was piercing sweet
5683,THE FAMILY,To see how strong we were and bold--
5684,THE FAMILY,How palpitant of wing.
5685,THE FAMILY,
5686,THE FAMILY,"We knew our father not, alas!"
5687,THE FAMILY,A hunter slew him while the grass
5688,THE FAMILY,Was fresh beneath the April rain.
5689,THE FAMILY,And ere I had the strength to fly
5690,THE FAMILY,Our brother sang a farewell strain
5691,THE FAMILY,And soared into the empty sky.
5692,THE FAMILY,And then our sister knew the fear
5693,THE FAMILY,And hunger of a serpent’s eye.
5694,THE FAMILY,"And our sweet mother, lone and drear,"
5695,THE FAMILY,Fled far afield and left me here
5696,THE FAMILY,To nurse my heart and sing.

5702,THE SUBWAY,
5703,THE SUBWAY,
5704,THE SUBWAY,"There was the white face of Fear,"
5705,THE SUBWAY,"And the solemn face of Duty,"
5706,THE SUBWAY,And the face of self looking in the mirror.
5707,THE SUBWAY,"But there were voices calling from vernal hilltops,"
5708,THE SUBWAY,"And silver spirits by moonlit gardens calling,"
5709,THE SUBWAY,"And voices of no sound from far horizons calling,"
5710,THE SUBWAY,But even if there be penitence for living
5711,THE SUBWAY,And thought and tears for the past
5712,THE SUBWAY,And even shame and even hunger;
5713,THE SUBWAY,"And if there be nothing gained at the last in living,"
5714,THE SUBWAY,And much to pay for the madness of briefest bliss;
5715,THE SUBWAY,"And if there be nothing in life, and life be nothing"
5716,THE SUBWAY,So that to nail one’s self to the cross is nothing lost--
5717,THE SUBWAY,Is Death not even less?
5718,THE SUBWAY,
5719,THE SUBWAY,These were the voices whereto we tore our flower
5720,THE SUBWAY,"Petal by petal apart and scattered it,"
5721,THE SUBWAY,And paused and paltered.
5722,THE SUBWAY,
5723,THE SUBWAY,"But lest the whispers grow louder,"
5724,THE SUBWAY,"And the eyebrows arch to a fiercer scorn,"
5725,THE SUBWAY,You fled away to France and left me
5726,THE SUBWAY,"With only a poor half uttered farewell,"
5727,THE SUBWAY,"A scrawl put off to the last, then written"
5728,THE SUBWAY,"As with shut eyes, swift nervous hands:"
5729,THE SUBWAY,As one might wait for the heroic thought
5730,THE SUBWAY,"To take his poison--wait in vain, and then"
5731,THE SUBWAY,Cowardly gulp it down and reel to death.
5732,THE SUBWAY,"I could not hate you for the pain of hate,"
5733,THE SUBWAY,"And could not love you who had hid yourself,"
5734,THE SUBWAY,Belied yourself behind this scrawl.
5735,THE SUBWAY,"I could only sit half-numb,"
5736,THE SUBWAY,And drift in thought.
5737,THE SUBWAY,
5738,THE SUBWAY,"And afterwards it wasn’t so much to be alone,"
5739,THE SUBWAY,"Nor to dream of the days that were done,"
5740,THE SUBWAY,"Save as it deepened the surge in my heart,"
5741,THE SUBWAY,Or strengthened the ebb of my soul for thought
5742,THE SUBWAY,"Of your soul drawn away from me,"
5743,THE SUBWAY,So needlessly drawn it seemed.
5744,THE SUBWAY,"And it’s the music that deepens and changes,--"
5745,THE SUBWAY,For as your soul adds strings to its strings
5746,THE SUBWAY,There are fingers to play--it almost seems
5747,THE SUBWAY,There are fingers about us that watch and wait
5748,THE SUBWAY,For a soul that’s adding strings to its harp
5749,THE SUBWAY,To play them when they’re strung.
5750,THE SUBWAY,And so it’s the music that deepens and changes
5751,THE SUBWAY,That kills you at last I think.
5752,THE SUBWAY,
5753,THE SUBWAY,"Well, I had a dream one night"
5754,THE SUBWAY,That a dead man well could dream:
5755,THE SUBWAY,They had buried me in Rosehill.
5756,THE SUBWAY,And after twenty years from France they brought you
5757,THE SUBWAY,And put you just across the walk from me
5758,THE SUBWAY,Where we slept while the crowding city grew
5759,THE SUBWAY,"To a vast six millions, and they were building"
5760,THE SUBWAY,A subway to Lake Forest.
5761,THE SUBWAY,"And we were forgotten of everyone,"
5762,THE SUBWAY,And almost our family names were lost.
5763,THE SUBWAY,"And our love you fled from all forgotten,"
5764,THE SUBWAY,"And everything we said, or thought, or felt forgotten"
5765,THE SUBWAY,With the whispers of boys and girls
5766,THE SUBWAY,In a temple’s shadow in Babylon.
5767,THE SUBWAY,
5768,THE SUBWAY,"Well, to pursue, it’s a day in March"
5769,THE SUBWAY,When the colors are brilliantly white and blue;
5770,THE SUBWAY,And it’s cold except for Poles and Italians
5771,THE SUBWAY,Who dig with spades and cut with picks.
5772,THE SUBWAY,"And some of these fellows are digging us up,"
5773,THE SUBWAY,"We lie in the way of the subway, you know."
5774,THE SUBWAY,"And they dump our bones in a careless heap,"
5775,THE SUBWAY,"The ribs of me by the ribs of you,"
5776,THE SUBWAY,My skull lies ignorant by your skull.
5777,THE SUBWAY,And behold our poor arms are entwined.
5778,THE SUBWAY,For death you know is a mocker of Life.
5779,THE SUBWAY,"And there we lie like stocks and stones,"
5780,THE SUBWAY,And where is our love and where is your fear?
5781,THE SUBWAY,And a young Pole pushes our bones together
5782,THE SUBWAY,"With a lusty shove of his heavy shoe,"
5783,THE SUBWAY,And he says to another: “You saw that girl
5784,THE SUBWAY,I was dancing with last night?
5785,THE SUBWAY,"Well, I don’t think I’m the only one."
5786,THE SUBWAY,And besides she bothers me most to death.
5787,THE SUBWAY,"And as soon as this subway job is over,"
5788,THE SUBWAY,"Which will be in a year, or year and a half,"
5789,THE SUBWAY,I’m going to beat it back to Poland.”
5790,THE SUBWAY,Then the other beginning to shovel muttered:
5791,THE SUBWAY,“1976.”

5796,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE
5797,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5798,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5799,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To the archangels and the fiery seed
5800,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Of mad Prometheus, fighting gods for men,"
5801,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"And heaven for earth, this greeting:"
5802,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"I led you once, I taught you, am the sire"
5803,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Of hosts of you, but fellow to you all."
5804,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"And when I fell, was chained upon this bed"
5805,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"By adamantine sickness, then I lay"
5806,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"And had you in my thought hour after hour,"
5807,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Day after day, and saw you in dreams by night"
5808,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Still fighting, bleeding, caring for the fallen,"
5809,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Or objurgating heaven for the curse
5810,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"It sheds on men, or arming for the fray"
5811,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,With steel of resisting thought; and so the sense
5812,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Of my responsibility has weighed
5813,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Upon me as my night has deftly dawned
5814,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"To something clearer than the soul you knew,"
5815,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Who led you once, with breath of iron horns,"
5816,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Called to you: Charge! there is the trench of greed!
5817,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Avenge the poor! bring justice! purge the state
5818,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Of fraud! And so I lay and thought of you
5819,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Still guarding the old lines, fighting the old fights,"
5820,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"While I was changed, was not your leader now,"
5821,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Cared no more for your battles, save as strife"
5822,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"That leads up higher, for upon my wall"
5823,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I woke to see these words: He only wins
5824,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,His freedom and existence who each day
5825,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Conquers them newly. How can I tell you
5826,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,What has come over me?
5827,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5828,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"You walk through galleries,"
5829,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Devour the pictures in the different rooms,"
5830,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Then gaze about you where you stand at last
5831,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Amid supernal canvases of light.
5832,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Try to recall the pictures you have studied,"
5833,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,What you have seen has helped you to perceive
5834,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"The final beauties, but is blurred in mind,"
5835,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"It has been lived, has lost its vital power,"
5836,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Is not the sovereign moment.
5837,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5838,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Climb a mountain
5839,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"The whole day through, and at the time of stars"
5840,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Stand on a peak and search infinity!
5841,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"You have forgot the valleys, save perhaps"
5842,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,The torment of the flies of which you’re freed
5843,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,In these cool heights.
5844,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5845,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,So age cannot recall
5846,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,The thrill and intimate complexities
5847,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,That made the thought of youth. A sickness comes:
5848,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"One has been metamorphosed, cannot live"
5849,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"The old emotions, habits, old delights."
5850,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,And as for that we change each day and all
5851,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Our yesterdays are chrysalises whence
5852,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"We crawled to what we are. In short, archangels,"
5853,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I have become another soul. Now listen:
5854,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5855,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I have seen things I cannot tell you of.
5856,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I have gained understandings past my power
5857,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To give you clearly; yet upon me rests
5858,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"The teasing call to tell you, here I lie"
5859,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Revolving this new task of leadership.
5860,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,How shall I make you see I have not failed you?
5861,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Not really played a treasonous soul to you?
5862,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Not scorned the cause I gave you, kept you in?"
5863,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Or damned you for, or made you suffer for?"
5864,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"I railed at heaven, I instructed you"
5865,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To rail as well. How can you understand
5866,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I now accept the fate? Will you despise me
5867,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,For saying this? Or will you say disease
5868,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Has weakened me, cooled off the fire of soul"
5869,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,And damped my courage? Then go on your way
5870,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To find a worthier leader?
5871,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5872,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,So to doubt
5873,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"I taught you once, but now my mind believes."
5874,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,And to deny the order of the world
5875,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"I gave you words, now I affirm the plan."
5876,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"To fight against the gods in man’s behalf,"
5877,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I made my leadership. Now I perceive
5878,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,The cause of gods and men made one. You see
5879,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,It is not individual gain that counts
5880,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,In these external benefits of freedom
5881,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"And satisfaction of material wants,"
5882,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"That counts so much, I say, as inner chains"
5883,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Struck from the wrists, and inner scales peeled off"
5884,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"From inner eyes. I grant the human cause,"
5885,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"And say this,--Can I make you understand?"
5886,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To give you proof my heart is with you yet
5887,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Let me reveal my sacrifice.
5888,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5889,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Suppose
5890,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"You’ve found a truth that others knew before you,"
5891,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Seen, let us say, the cat, as single taxers"
5892,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Are wont to say? You hunt up some adherent
5893,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Who’s labored with you, tell him, “I’m convinced,"
5894,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I see the cat at last.” You want to share
5895,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Your joy with some one, want his dragging hope"
5896,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To hear you have arrived. And so with me
5897,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,I hungered to communicate my vision
5898,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"To some one who had seen it, and who knew"
5899,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Its meaning, what it meant to me."
5900,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,
5901,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,But then
5902,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,You archangels and hot Promethean seed
5903,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Each time I thought of making the confession
5904,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"To some delighted spirit, ranged yourselves"
5905,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"In thought around my sick bed, with contempt,"
5906,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Or pained compassion written on your brows,"
5907,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"And words like these: He has deserted us,"
5908,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"He has surrendered, cringed before the gods."
5909,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,And so my sacrifice is this: You’ll be
5910,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"The first to know my second birth, you can"
5911,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"In such case never charge it up to fear,"
5912,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Or weakness, shrunken nerves, or spirit"
5913,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,That lost the human touch through the effects
5914,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"Of some delirium. What mind so clear,"
5915,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,Or will so strong to die with this denial
5916,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,For your sakes? For it may be best for you
5917,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,To live the rebel out of you. And if
5918,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,You thought--at least I fear it--if you thought
5919,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"I had gone over to the hosts you hate,"
5920,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"As you are now, through weakness, made my peace"
5921,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"With heaven, as you’d call it, just to save"
5922,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"My wretched self, you’d have a mad regret,"
5923,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"A fine disgust to work through, added labor"
5924,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,"To all you must achieve. That’s why I die,"
5925,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,And seal this message. Break it on the day
5926,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,They make me ashes!
5927,THE RADICAL’S MESSAGE,

6043,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,I am filled with my loathing! Oh keep me a Greek though
6044,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,"you make me a whoreson,"
6045,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,When the worship of beauty is dead you may pare off my foreskin.
6046,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,

6056,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,"Areopagus listened to Paul, I am told, for Athens is spending"

6065,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,"Oh Athens, who set up that shrine, do you think it was just superstition"
6066,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,Which carved for all passers to see that profoundest inscription:

6070,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,

6089,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,
6090,THE APOLOGY OF DEMETRIUS,And yet Hyacinthus I pity this Paul for profoundest compassion

6110,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6111,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"There was slight rain that afternoon,"
6112,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And tempest in the apple trees;
6113,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,But as the sun went down the moon
6114,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Sailed swiftly to a western breeze.
6115,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6116,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Day kindled something in your blood,"
6117,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Your fancies roved with dove and hawk;
6118,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,There was no promise in your mood
6119,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Nor soft assurance in your talk.
6120,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6121,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,I felt you might mislead my trust
6122,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And slight a love too surely yours;
6123,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"You were so wild, I felt you must"
6124,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Be kindred to the woods and moors.
6125,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6126,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,But when we passed the orchard through
6127,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,The dusk had crept into the sky;
6128,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Your eyes betrayed a dream which grew
6129,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Until I thought I heard you sigh.
6130,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6131,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,You were an ardent star that waited
6132,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,For night to be yourself and show
6133,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,How surely afternoon had fated
6134,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,A love that nothing could forego.
6135,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6136,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6137,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,_Act Two_
6138,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6139,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,The sky was full of clouds at rest
6140,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Like dolphins in a waste of blue.
6141,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,We tramped along a country road
6142,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Into the village, I and you."
6143,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6144,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,The dogwood bloomed along the fences.
6145,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,We heard the songs of larks and thrushes.
6146,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,The country door-yards teemed with hues
6147,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Of lilac trees and almond bushes.
6148,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6149,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,The long blaze of the setting sun
6150,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Shone in your eyes and analyzed
6151,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Their little rifts of gray and brown,"
6152,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And left your secret undisguised.
6153,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6154,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And I was silent thinking over
6155,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,The old threads raveled from your heart.
6156,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,I hear you clearer now than then:
6157,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,“How can we part? How can we part?”
6158,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6159,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6160,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,_Act Three_
6161,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6162,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Shadows upon the wall
6163,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"And the ghost of a past on the floor,"
6164,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Here where the hours made carnival
6165,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,In the days that are no more.
6166,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6167,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"And the chamber is cold and bare,"
6168,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And the wax from the taper drips;
6169,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"But I bury my face in your hair,"
6170,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And swoon at the touch of your lips.
6171,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6172,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"We went from the house to the wood,"
6173,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,But never a word we spoke;
6174,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And an eerie wind like our mood
6175,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Rustled the leaves of the oak.
6176,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6177,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Dead leaves, tremulous, crisp,"
6178,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,That breathed a forgotten tune;
6179,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,A cloud the shape of a wisp
6180,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Blotted the soaring moon.
6181,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6182,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Silent we walked the path,"
6183,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And then the wild farewell;
6184,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,I saw your form like a wraith
6185,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Fade in the forest’s dell.
6186,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6187,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"If joy would never depart,"
6188,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,If we could but still the pain--
6189,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Dear, I awoke with a pang in my heart"
6190,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And heard the sound of the rain.

6197,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"It’s April again, and there are dolphin"
6198,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Clouds at rest in a waste of blue.
6199,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6200,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,A girl goes by with a spray of lilacs
6201,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Pinned at her breast, and quick as thought"
6202,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Country fences, dogwood blossoms"
6203,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Over the granite scene are wrought.
6204,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6205,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,You come in my mind! It’s spoiled by the glimpse
6206,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Of a monster diamond that glints and glows;
6207,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,A black-eyed Gadarene goes past
6208,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Insolent, heavy, and hooked of nose."
6209,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,
6210,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"I scan his face that runs with fat,"
6211,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,And the fleshly sag of his under lip;
6212,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,"Then back to the diamond again, the hand"
6213,A PLAY IN FOUR ACTS,Holds your arm with a master grip!

6227,THEODORE DREISER,"Moving about rhythmically, exploding in laughter."
6228,THEODORE DREISER,"Touching fingers together back and forth,"

6364,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Hungered for gifts with hunger passionate
6365,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And in her childhood made a hard fate
6366,NEW YEAR’S DAY,For a father who had failed and who was wild
6367,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"With a kind of laughing despair,"
6368,NEW YEAR’S DAY,That comes of having failed.
6369,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"She had plain dresses, only a little strand"
6370,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Of coral beads, and ribbons for her hair"
6371,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Bestowed by grandmama. And on her hand
6372,NEW YEAR’S DAY,A ring of beads that maddened her and paled
6373,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Beside the gold rings other girls could show.
6374,NEW YEAR’S DAY,So she grew up out of this woe
6375,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Of wanting and not having things.
6376,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And round this nucleus of desire
6377,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Her nature wound itself into a spire,"
6378,NEW YEAR’S DAY,As a vine climbs up and clings
6379,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Till it becomes the tree;
6380,NEW YEAR’S DAY,So she became all fire
6381,NEW YEAR’S DAY,For the world’s glittering glory.
6382,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6383,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Then in the process of her being’s story
6384,NEW YEAR’S DAY,She married a man of riches and took over
6385,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Dresses and jewels, houses, with her lover."
6386,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"And learned the ways of Paris and New York,"
6387,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"And how to sit, or look, or use one’s fork."
6388,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"And how to speak in French, and how to dress."
6389,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And how to find and use the loveliness
6390,NEW YEAR’S DAY,That gold brings. And she lived where thought is white
6391,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"With its great longing for the infinite,"
6392,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Where pale youths dream and write,"
6393,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And starve and lie awake at night;
6394,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Where sculpture, music and where painting is"
6395,NEW YEAR’S DAY,On priceless canvases.
6396,NEW YEAR’S DAY,But none of this saw she
6397,NEW YEAR’S DAY,In feeding her desire with jollity
6398,NEW YEAR’S DAY,In the cafés and in society;
6399,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Wherever the denials of her youth
6400,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Could be made whole, or leveled up"
6401,NEW YEAR’S DAY,With idle splendor or the champagne cup.
6402,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"That was her dream of making her life truth,"
6403,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Till she devoured her husband like a leman--
6404,NEW YEAR’S DAY,She was at last one of this kind of women.
6405,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Then as a widow she came journeying back
6406,NEW YEAR’S DAY,With trunks and maids upon a New Year’s day
6407,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Over her childhood’s disappointed track.
6408,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6409,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Her father meanwhile had gone on the way
6410,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Which was his at the start.
6411,NEW YEAR’S DAY,His life was like a bruise which does not smart
6412,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Now that it has grown hard.
6413,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And he was stoical like one who hugs
6414,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"His inner self until sensation dies,"
6415,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Or dulls his fears or sorrows with strong drugs.
6416,NEW YEAR’S DAY,There was a light of hardness in his eyes
6417,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Through which no one could see his secret pain.
6418,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Failure had made him so--he could explain
6419,NEW YEAR’S DAY,To no one how he had been caught in life;
6420,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Sometimes it seemed himself, sometimes his wife,"
6421,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And he had thought of it so much he lost
6422,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Perspective of himself, therefore he kept"
6423,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Great silence, speaking little, even then"
6424,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"But trivial things. He trod his path and slept,"
6425,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And rose to tread the path and slept again.
6426,NEW YEAR’S DAY,He was resolved to pay the bitter cost
6427,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And not cry out--his thinking stood on guard
6428,NEW YEAR’S DAY,To this end chiefly.
6429,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6430,NEW YEAR’S DAY,With impassive heart
6431,NEW YEAR’S DAY,He wrote his daughter on a postal card
6432,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"To come, if it should please her, and be home"
6433,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"On Christmas, if she could, on New Year’s day"
6434,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"If she preferred, but anyway to come."
6435,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6436,NEW YEAR’S DAY,If a ghost could patch its tomb
6437,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"With a trowel from time to time,"
6438,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"If it had a little lime,"
6439,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"So as to stop the cracks and growing rifts,"
6440,NEW YEAR’S DAY,That would be like this man who hated gifts
6441,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Because he scarce could give them, and had patched"
6442,NEW YEAR’S DAY,With hardness where his heart had broken
6443,NEW YEAR’S DAY,In years gone for the holidays when she
6444,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Cried in such ignorance of his poverty.
6445,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Now with walled feelings he could sit unspoken
6446,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Of what he felt, regretted, or had lost--"
6447,NEW YEAR’S DAY,He was that kind of ghost.
6448,NEW YEAR’S DAY,So when the daughter came he only had
6449,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Her mother and the dinner, greetings glad,"
6450,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And certain pride because her life had matched
6451,NEW YEAR’S DAY,With childhood’s hopes--but still he had no gifts
6452,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"For Christmas or for New Year’s, and the daughter"
6453,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Wept when she found it so,--’twas always so,--"
6454,NEW YEAR’S DAY,It made her youthful bitterness alive.
6455,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And so she spilled her water
6456,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Out of a trembling hand at dinner and arose
6457,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And left the table. But with specs on nose
6458,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Self-mastered, not revealing"
6459,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"What was his feeling,"
6460,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"The father ate the dinner alone, while mother"
6461,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Was comforting the daughter.
6462,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6463,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"“He might have given me a dollar, a little book,"
6464,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"A handkerchief, or any other"
6465,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Little thing, he always acted so.”"
6466,NEW YEAR’S DAY,The mother tried to soothe her daughter’s woe.
6467,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"But while they were together, the father took"
6468,NEW YEAR’S DAY,His steps up town and when the two came back
6469,NEW YEAR’S DAY,They found him gone and the room growing black
6470,NEW YEAR’S DAY,From falling night....
6471,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6472,NEW YEAR’S DAY,But later he came in
6473,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And sat by the fire all silent. This had been
6474,NEW YEAR’S DAY,His New Year’s day! And later his wife came
6475,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And sat across him silent in her blame
6476,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Of him and of his life.
6477,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6478,NEW YEAR’S DAY,She said at last:
6479,NEW YEAR’S DAY,“Blanche is heart sick.”
6480,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6481,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"“Well, I am sixty-five,”"
6482,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"He answered her, “and never while I’m alive"
6483,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Will I remember Christmas or a New Year’s day.
6484,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"I’m glad so many of such days are past,"
6485,NEW YEAR’S DAY,They have been always this way. We had dinner
6486,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And ourselves for her and she brought herself
6487,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And nothing else. This is the way to win her
6488,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Admiration, yet this thing of giving"
6489,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Dollars or books, wins only a little thrill"
6490,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Of tickled pride or egotism, still"
6491,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"I might have done it, just to have the peace"
6492,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Of her self-satisfaction.”
6493,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6494,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Said the wife:
6495,NEW YEAR’S DAY,“You might find happiness in her happiness.
6496,NEW YEAR’S DAY,The only thing you understand in living
6497,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Is how to stand your misery, one can guess"
6498,NEW YEAR’S DAY,The working of your thought.”
6499,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6500,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Ere she could cease
6501,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"The daughter entered like the devil’s elf,"
6502,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"And saw her father bent before the fire,"
6503,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And saw the back of his head which spoke to her
6504,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"Of hardness, or of something that she hated"
6505,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Which moved her pity and her hate at once.
6506,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6507,NEW YEAR’S DAY,And then the mother said: “You two are fated
6508,NEW YEAR’S DAY,To be as blind as two cliffs to each other.
6509,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"You need I think a spiritual re-birth,"
6510,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Something that you could have upon this earth.
6511,NEW YEAR’S DAY,For I can see a book or handkerchief
6512,NEW YEAR’S DAY,Would give one happiness and one relief
6513,NEW YEAR’S DAY,From hardness which is girding in your soul.
6514,NEW YEAR’S DAY,"That would be rich return for small outlay,"
6515,NEW YEAR’S DAY,God give us all another New Year’s day.”
6516,NEW YEAR’S DAY,
6517,NEW YEAR’S DAY,

6522,PLAYING BLIND,
6523,PLAYING BLIND,You used to play at being blind--
6524,PLAYING BLIND,Now you are blind--you used to say:
6525,PLAYING BLIND,“Play I am blind and help me find
6526,PLAYING BLIND,Where the gate opens on the way.”
6527,PLAYING BLIND,
6528,PLAYING BLIND,"I laughed at you, we laughed together"
6529,PLAYING BLIND,"When you were playing blind, your staff"
6530,PLAYING BLIND,My walking cane of varnished leather--
6531,PLAYING BLIND,Now you are blind and still you laugh.
6532,PLAYING BLIND,
6533,PLAYING BLIND,You sit beneath the reading lamp
6534,PLAYING BLIND,With long lashed eyelids closed and pale
6535,PLAYING BLIND,"And make me read you Riley’s Tramp,"
6536,PLAYING BLIND,And Grimm and many a fairy tale.
6537,PLAYING BLIND,
6538,PLAYING BLIND,Sometimes I stop--you see I choke
6539,PLAYING BLIND,Before the tale is done by half--
6540,PLAYING BLIND,One’s eyes blur from tobacco smoke--
6541,PLAYING BLIND,I cannot laugh now when you laugh.

6546,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN
6547,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6548,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6549,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,If I could only see you again--
6550,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,If I could only see you again!
6551,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,How can it be
6552,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,I shall never see you again?
6553,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,For the world has shown it can roll on its way
6554,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And blot you out forever--
6555,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And I shall never see you again!
6556,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,I thrill as one who slips on the edge of a gulf
6557,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,When I think I shall never see you again!
6558,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6559,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,As a dead leaf is hurtled over the tops of trees;
6560,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,As a dead leaf is dizzily driven through woodland valleys
6561,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,I am driven and tossed in the storms of living.
6562,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"But as the dead leaf escapes the breeze’s fingers,"
6563,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And sinks till it nestles motionless under a rock
6564,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,So in quiet moments I dream
6565,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Of you,"
6566,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,I dream of all that you were--
6567,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And I shall never see you again!
6568,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6569,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,There never was any one like you!
6570,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"There never yet was such joy in a heart,"
6571,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Such strength to live whatever the fate,"
6572,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Such love to love,"
6573,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Such thought to see how life is good,"
6574,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Such maternal passion,"
6575,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Such breasts eager to nurse child after child--
6576,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And I shall never see you again!
6577,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6578,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Your breasts were made to suckle conquerors,"
6579,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Warriors, prophets,"
6580,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Invincible souls
6581,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Loving life, and loving death at last."
6582,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"And now your breasts are dust,"
6583,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"You are all dust,"
6584,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,You are lost save for my memory.
6585,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6586,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And this morning I woke
6587,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,As a leaf might wake in its sheltered place
6588,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Under the rock
6589,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Stirred by a breath of April.
6590,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And I lived again the last time I saw you--
6591,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,The last visit!
6592,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,You were almost ninety then.
6593,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,But there was the old zest in your heart
6594,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,To do all things and have all things
6595,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Unchanged, as I had known them"
6596,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,As a boy.
6597,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"You gave me the same room,"
6598,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Nothing was changed,"
6599,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Not a chair, a curtain, a picture."
6600,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And you came up-stairs before it was day
6601,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And lighted a fire in the little stove
6602,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,To have the room warm for me to dress in--
6603,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,There never was love like yours!
6604,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6605,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And I went down to the kitchen and found you
6606,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"Frying batter cakes, and laughing,"
6607,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And bringing back my boyhood days
6608,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,With the old stories.
6609,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"And how you kissed me, and hugged me"
6610,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,With your withered arms!
6611,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"And then you sat down with me,"
6612,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"And ate with me as of old,"
6613,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,And brought out priceless jars of things
6614,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Which you had made and saved for me!
6615,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6616,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,The breath of memory stirs me
6617,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Under the rock.
6618,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,"I must have the madness of life to drive me,"
6619,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,To toss me
6620,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,Into forgetfulness of my loss of you--
6621,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,For I shall never see you again!
6622,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6623,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6624,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6625,I SHALL NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
6626,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----
6627,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,
6628,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,
6629,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,I pace the rooms and wait for John’s return.
6630,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"My heart beats all too fast, I feel a pain"
6631,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Around my heart, my hands grow cold, I burn"
6632,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Through neck and cheeks. And thus I live in vain.
6633,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"John comes at last and says, “There is no mail,"
6634,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,No letter for you.” And with whirling brain
6635,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"I turn away in silence, growing pale,"
6636,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,And whisper to myself: to be resigned
6637,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,To wretchedness perhaps is to prevail
6638,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,O’er wretchedness and win a peace of mind.
6639,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"To love you so, to thirst for you, to pay"
6640,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"For outward calm with inner storms confined,"
6641,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,To lie awake by night and spend the day
6642,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"In restless thoughts, is life too hard to bear."
6643,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"I see you in my troubled dreams alway,"
6644,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"You face me with a grave and haughty air,"
6645,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Serene, incensed against me who intrude"
6646,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,An interest which you have no heart to share.
6647,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Forgive me then my sorrow’s servitude,"
6648,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"To write to you my suffering will ease,"
6649,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,And fill the aching of my solitude.
6650,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,I have gone forth to Nature to find peace:
6651,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"The woods are filled with purple lupine now,"
6652,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Small yellow asters, phlox, and cramoisies"
6653,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Of columbine and roses, vine and bough."
6654,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The wild grape and the cherry haunt the dunes
6655,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,With odors sweet as love. To cool my brow
6656,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,I walk the heights upon these afternoons
6657,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,And watch the blue waste of the sky’s descent.
6658,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,And yesterday where golden light festoons
6659,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,With flickering sorcery the way we went
6660,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,’Twixt sprays of beech and sassafras I stole
6661,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Till once again at the hill’s top half-spent
6662,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,I saw the shore dunes and the waters roll.
6663,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,We climbed it once together--it was there
6664,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The Bacchic madness came into your soul
6665,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,To take me in your arms. And now I bear
6666,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Your coldness, your reproaches, you who call"
6667,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,My longing and my spiritual despair
6668,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"A mere neurosis, or hysterical"
6669,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Outcropping to be conquered. It was wrong
6670,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"To take me in your arms, and then when all"
6671,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Was not yours then to tell me to be strong,"
6672,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,And urge your marriage vows now I have thought
6673,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The problem of my love through. I belong
6674,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,To you Monsieur; whatever grief is wrought
6675,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Of body or of soul to satisfy
6676,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"The flame is better, and is far less fraught"
6677,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,With mad regret than it can be to lie
6678,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,In restless torture. O my friend withdraw
6679,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Your friendship from me never lest I die!
6680,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Yes, I could live and work if I foresaw"
6681,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Your friendship mine and letters by your hand
6682,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Arriving in this lonely place to thaw
6683,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The ice around my heart’s flame. Understand
6684,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,From those I love but little love I need:
6685,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Crumbs from your feast you scarce can countermand,"
6686,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"And crumbs are all I ask, and just the meed"
6687,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Of friendly interest. I abase my pride.
6688,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The strong can suffer silently and bleed
6689,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"As long as strength lasts, keep the blood inside,"
6690,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Until one weakens when it spurts and drips.
6691,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"And Pride turns Nature, careless now to hide"
6692,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The inner bleeding bubbling at the lips.
6693,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,I write you this without regret or shame.
6694,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,My strength has left me in the blue eclipse
6695,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Of agony. Monsieur, I take the blame,"
6696,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"If any come, of fanning dangerously"
6697,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The spark that brightened once and would be flame--
6698,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Is that not true? Or do you say to me:
6699,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"“You are no more my pupil, I retrench"
6700,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"“The memory of things that cease to be,"
6701,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"“And go my way with teaching young girls French,"
6702,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,“As I taught you. Two years have passed since then.
6703,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,“What is this thought that time has failed to quench?
6704,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"“You who are laureled in the world of men,"
6705,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"“A genius risen like a morning star,"
6706,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,“Does not that glory fill you?” Yet again
6707,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,I answer you one’s genius burns afar
6708,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"In useless splendor if it warm no cheek,"
6709,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Make bright no eye, lead on no darkling spar--"
6710,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Genius is love, is freedom, it must speak,"
6711,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Work out its fate from egocentric life;
6712,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,It is more swift than other feet to seek
6713,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Its ruin with its hope, or take the knife"
6714,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,More willingly to breast than those who sink
6715,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,In involuted growth. To be your wife
6716,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"I do not dream, I only wish to drink"
6717,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"The cup with you and break the bread with you,"
6718,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,To feel thereby our lives are one and think
6719,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"We are one creed and one communion, new"
6720,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"In spirit, born anew, that I may have"
6721,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"An altar for my genius, something true"
6722,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"And near in flesh to triumph for, or brave"
6723,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The world or evil for. Genius is love.
6724,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,It cannot bear itself alone to save;
6725,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"It must another rescue, it must prove"
6726,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Its growing strength in ministry. Monsieur,"
6727,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Bruise not my soul by ignorance hereof,"
6728,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,My reverend father thinks my thoughts are pure--
6729,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,If he should read this! But if you dismiss
6730,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,This letter with a smile and say her cure
6731,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Is the reaction of forbidden bliss,"
6732,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"It is most true, but you would not degrade"
6733,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"My love for you with that analysis,"
6734,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,And that alone. For surely God who made
6735,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,Our souls and bodies so meant we should rise
6736,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"Through their desires, and does God pervade"
6737,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"This glowing mass of life, these starry skies"
6738,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,"With other power? Now scorn me, if you will."
6739,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,The unburdened heart has tamed its agonies.
6740,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,
6741,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,
6742,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,
6743,ELIZABETH TO MONSIEUR D----,
6744,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST
6745,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6746,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6747,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,In time I’ll tell you all the dreams I’ve had--
6748,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"But now--well, let me think! O yes three times"
6749,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I’ve dreamed a creature with a dragon’s head,"
6750,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Which was her head as well, for so it seemed,"
6751,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Gemmed with her brazen eyes half luminous
6752,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And half opaque, slate colored, lay across"
6753,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My breast and hurt my heart, and breathed her breath"
6754,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"From half-dead, livid overlapping lips"
6755,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,(As when you crush a snake’s head jaws will lie
6756,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Awry and out of plumb) like pestilence
6757,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Right in my nostrils. This interpreted
6758,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Means characters are breaths, and most are bad"
6759,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"When closely known. Such breath suits well the dragon,"
6760,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"But would not suit her, so you’d think to see"
6761,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"How fair her face, how seeming fair her soul."
6762,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,So let me tell you.
6763,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6764,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"All my hair is gray,"
6765,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My youth is gone, pretense will work no more."
6766,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I’m fifty-seven, yet I cling to youth,"
6767,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Because I cling to love, have never known"
6768,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Aught but successions of immoderate--what?
6769,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6770,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Some call it lust--you call it libido.
6771,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Well it is urge, creative fire and drives"
6772,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"The artist half-soul mad, as I am mad--"
6773,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Look how my poor hand trembles, my voice breaks--"
6774,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"No! I’ll go on. I’ll tell you all, be done."
6775,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Then if you cannot cure me, there’s a balm"
6776,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I know myself.
6777,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6778,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,If I had only loved
6779,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Elizabeth, who wrote me years ago"
6780,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Such pleading letters--every man can win
6781,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Some woman’s love completely, had she won"
6782,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,My love as well! O what a monstrous world
6783,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Where such envenomed fire is, held by Chance"
6784,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And shot in blindness. So she felt the flame
6785,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And looked on me, I felt the flame and looked"
6786,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Upon this cockatrice.
6787,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6788,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,So as I said
6789,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I had been teacher, actor, writer, poet,"
6790,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Had seen my face on lithographs, felt warm"
6791,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,In every capillary for that face
6792,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Which seemed star-guided, noble, to be loved,"
6793,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Revered, and thus through self-esteem I bore"
6794,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My failures hoping, buoyed by some success"
6795,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,As the swift years went by.
6796,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6797,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,But on a day
6798,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"When I was forty-five, looked thirty-five,"
6799,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"No gray hairs then, they called me thirty-five,"
6800,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My name went round the city, in the press"
6801,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"They hailed me as a genius, I had played"
6802,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Othello to their liking, was yet young"
6803,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And promised much, they said. That afternoon"
6804,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"A woman came to see me in my suite,"
6805,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Wonder and admiration in her eyes.
6806,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Her manner halted, as she thumbed a book"
6807,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Upon the table, while she told her tale:"
6808,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She had won favor as an amateur,"
6809,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Could I, the greatest talked of man to-day,"
6810,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Show her the way to greatness, might it be"
6811,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,A modest part could be assigned to her
6812,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,When I played mad Othello?
6813,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6814,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I have found
6815,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,That when a woman has no business with you
6816,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Her calling speaks the oldest one of all.
6817,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,So true to this I acted. We commenced
6818,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And for three months I struggled for the prize.
6819,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Her first play was to make me pity her.
6820,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She told me of her suffering, her youth,"
6821,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"(She was then thirty-five), her poverty,"
6822,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Her labor to learn French. And like a man
6823,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I pitied her and opened up my purse.
6824,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She said, “No! No! this hat and dress will do,"
6825,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,It brushes well.” She would not take a cent.
6826,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I saw her daily for a month before
6827,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I won her. Though she gave me hands and lips--
6828,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"There was a fury in her lips, my heart"
6829,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Seemed like to stop--I could not win the prize.
6830,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"One day she broke in tears: “You seemed so noble,"
6831,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"So great of mind, are you then like the rest"
6832,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Who want a woman’s body, nothing else?”"
6833,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"“I want your love,” I said, “your love for mine,"
6834,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I love you, dearest!” faugh, must I repeat"
6835,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,The gagging words? So I declared the love
6836,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I felt too deeply, and to prove my love"
6837,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I added: “I’ll renounce the gift of love,"
6838,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My Lady Wonderful, worship you afar."
6839,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"You would not have me tortured by your eyes,"
6840,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Nor have me see you often, in this case!”"
6841,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,So I had given love as I had given
6842,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"All wealth that I could pour of soul, achievement,"
6843,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Name in the world, all pride, all thought of self"
6844,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Present or future to this woman, now"
6845,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,For love’s sake I renounced the gift of love.
6846,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And so I left her. Well, she called me back."
6847,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And though I was a fool, and blinded too,"
6848,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I saw her thought and won her in an hour.
6849,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"So then commenced my madness, for she said"
6850,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,It could not be again. The blood I tasted
6851,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Could not be drunk. “You love me,” she would say,"
6852,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"“Then bring me not to shame, it will be known"
6853,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,If we go on. I cannot lose my bread.
6854,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Librarians cannot have their names in doubt
6855,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Who serve the public, as I do.” So it was"
6856,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"The madness braced my will, and unrelenting"
6857,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I sought her, won her. In a little while"
6858,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,We were adjusted to habitual love.
6859,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And I was happy save when I was mad.
6860,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,For she knew younger men who came to call;
6861,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Or take her to the theatre, with one"
6862,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She corresponded. “Let it be,” she said,"
6863,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"“I must not be in public with you, dear,"
6864,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Whose name and greatness in the world would point
6865,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To our relationship, how could it be"
6866,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"You would be with a woman without station,"
6867,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Celebrity or wealth, except for this?"
6868,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,These others are a blind.”
6869,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6870,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I could not solve
6871,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Out of the whirling clouds of passion truth--
6872,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My days were tortured, in the dreams of sleep"
6873,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I saw this dragon head I told you of.
6874,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And so through heavy venery, and dread,"
6875,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And anger, doubt, faith, love and much of hate,"
6876,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I took to drink.
6877,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6878,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"So drinking with her once,"
6879,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"For she could drink me blind, I turned and said:"
6880,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"“You say I am the first, I think you lie.”"
6881,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,She wailed a flood of tears. A hundred eyes
6882,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Turned on us in the café where we sat.
6883,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6884,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"We left and walked the park. I goaded her,"
6885,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Pried out the secret. Why, at twenty-three"
6886,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,She had become the mistress of a man.
6887,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,It ended just six months before she came
6888,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,To see me in my suite.
6889,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6890,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Now here I was:
6891,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,To hold on to myself I had to hold
6892,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"This woman, win her wholly, crush her soul,"
6893,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Destroy her so she would no longer be
6894,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,My heart’s desire. For I had given all.
6895,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And I could see she valued it the less
6896,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"As time went on. My name, what was it now?"
6897,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My art, what was it now? She even hinted"
6898,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I could not act Othello. There was nothing
6899,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I could do more to keep her, hold her love,"
6900,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Her admiration. O how good esteem
6901,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Seems to a man who forfeits it to her
6902,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Whose body he can have, who cannot have"
6903,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,That sympathy whereby a man is nerved
6904,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,To daily work and living. What is Art?
6905,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"No picture would be painted, poem sung"
6906,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Save for the thought that woman close at hand,"
6907,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Or somewhere in the world yet to be found
6908,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"By reason of the picture or the poem,"
6909,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Will see and love you for it.
6910,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6911,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Let me say
6912,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"In passing, and dismiss it, I began"
6913,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,With little sums until I gave her much.
6914,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,There’s matter of more moment.
6915,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6916,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I confess,"
6917,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"In spite of my licentious life, the creed"
6918,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"One sees among the artists, where I’ve lived,"
6919,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To strong belief in woman’s virtue, yes,"
6920,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,In spite of lip avowal of the faith
6921,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Of love called free, I have not quite believed it."
6922,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"But it was in her soul. She sucked that milk,"
6923,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"A child upon her mother’s breast, she said--"
6924,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"It all came out at last from many talks,"
6925,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And then, just then, I thought I saw foreshadowed"
6926,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,A social change upon the things of sex:
6927,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"We read together Ann Veronica,"
6928,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And Bernard Shaw, and laughed and said, at last"
6929,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,We see each other clearly. We have found
6930,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,A footing for our life. I slept at last.
6931,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,The dragon vanished from my dreams. I waked
6932,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"A song upon my lips, left drink alone,"
6933,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Could face my image in the looking-glass,"
6934,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And find restored a noble quality,"
6935,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,A strength and genius.
6936,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6937,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,But if love be free
6938,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And if you love though only for an hour
6939,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Why not the cup of love? Her former friend
6940,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Piqued to an interest by my love for her
6941,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Came back to see if he had overlooked
6942,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"A beauty he would have. Well, she confessed"
6943,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Their night together. It was at the time
6944,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,My poor canzones which sang our stormy love
6945,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Had just been finished. Every artist fool
6946,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Writes sonnets or canzones once in his life.
6947,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And so I had to add a verse to tell
6948,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Her faithlessness--or was it faithlessness?
6949,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Since she declared she loved me, did not love"
6950,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,This older friend. But if she did not love him
6951,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,What was this act? She called it just a trial
6952,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Of our love which had stood the test, O God"
6953,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Such mazes for my soul!
6954,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6955,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Flushed then with wrath
6956,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And drink I beat her cruelly. She stood
6957,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"With scarce a cry of pain and let me strike,"
6958,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And said if I considered it was just
6959,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To beat her so, she wished to bear the pain."
6960,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Then with a cry I ceased. We fell asleep
6961,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Stretched on the bed together. When we woke
6962,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,She kissed me her forgiveness. I returned
6963,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"The kiss, ah me!"
6964,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6965,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,So now the story turns.
6966,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,There was a woman critic who pursued
6967,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,My work with hateful words. Before I knew
6968,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,The cockatrice I found it best to fold
6969,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"This critic’s column under, never read."
6970,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And in a day or two from that on which
6971,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I beat my mistress, what should I behold?--"
6972,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,A letter from her--she had left the town
6973,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Without my knowing, she was visiting"
6974,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,This critic enemy at her summer home.
6975,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And in this mail I found my poor canzones
6976,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Returned to me, and in the letter this:"
6977,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,“My friend says for some reason you would try
6978,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To compromise me by this wretched verse,"
6979,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"So I return it to you, go and burn."
6980,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I shall not see you more--so she advises,"
6981,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And so I think. I wish you well no less.
6982,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"You are a little old to rise to fame,"
6983,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Or excellence in acting, yet go on."
6984,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Perhaps there is not aught beside to do,"
6985,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And it will occupy your mind, good-bye.”"
6986,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
6987,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,So shortly everywhere I seemed to sense
6988,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,The feeling that they deemed me foul and base.
6989,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"While we were friends I made her known to artists,"
6990,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And writers in the city. With this start
6991,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,She had gone on and multiplied her friends
6992,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Among this folk. I saw it all at once
6993,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,As one sees dawn from darkness. Then
6994,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"The social standard melted, gave away"
6995,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,To all that had been written for some years.
6996,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Free love had won at last. And we who kept
6997,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Our love in hiding, she who lied to keep"
6998,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Her name as one who lived a maiden’s life,"
6999,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And I who doubted, hated her because"
7000,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She was not freshly mine, we, she and I,"
7001,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Stepped to a world all new, she to enjoy"
7002,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And I to perish. I was weak from loss
7003,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Of blood from wounds she gave me, spent for love"
7004,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Poured for her sorrow, for she grieved and wept"
7005,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"That I was not her early love, her love"
7006,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,At love’s beginning. I went here and there
7007,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To build her life up, make it rich, repair"
7008,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"The injuries of her youth, retrieve the days"
7009,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Which had brought loneliness. Forbear with me--
7010,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I thought I could tell all in just a word--
7011,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Yes, this is it--She learned what was my strength"
7012,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And took it for her own, found out my faults"
7013,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And struck me there. She gave me confidence
7014,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And trust, I fancied. On analysis"
7015,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She had concealed herself, there had not been"
7016,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Clear understanding with us. So she took
7017,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My friends, and friends are never wholly friends,"
7018,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And made them hers, through these made other friends,"
7019,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Explored my havens, my alliances,"
7020,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,My secret powers of prestige in the world.
7021,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And I awoke to find the world my foe!
7022,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And every desk of every editor
7023,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Silent for knowledge of me, breaking silence"
7024,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,In just a word of hate. You see she loosed
7025,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,This story like a mist which creeps through cracks
7026,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,That I had compromised her. Then behold
7027,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I who had helped to bring this era in
7028,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Of sex equality, yes, in spite of all,"
7029,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My ingrained feelings I have spoken of,"
7030,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Found myself robbed of her by just the creed
7031,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I had upheld, and saw her live with him"
7032,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Who was her friend, before I knew her, yes,"
7033,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And justified by those whom she had feared,"
7034,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Because they hated me, and pitied him"
7035,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Bound to a woman in a loveless life
7036,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Who would not free him, let him marry her."
7037,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
7038,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Then the last atom of my strength I summoned
7039,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,To play Othello. It was death or life!
7040,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Soul triumph or soul ruin. But you see
7041,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,The cockatrice had sent the word around
7042,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And sharpened every critic eye. I faced
7043,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"An audience of one mind, could sense it all"
7044,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Where hatred, mild amusement were well mixed"
7045,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To poison, paralyze creative power,"
7046,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And even break my memory. But I said
7047,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Show now your genius, drink the hatred in"
7048,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Till all your spirit sparkles as a star
7049,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,When the north wind of winter blows at night.
7050,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Nothing opposes but a woman’s hate.
7051,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Rise on its wreckage. So I spurred myself.
7052,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,And even when I saw her critic friend
7053,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Limned from the mass of faces, lost my clue"
7054,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"And waited for the prompter, then my rage"
7055,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Upheld me--yes, but wait--the rest is brief."
7056,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
7057,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,I had not acted through the strangle scene
7058,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"When I heard calls and bells, the curtain fell,"
7059,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,My understudy led me from the stage.
7060,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Out in the night we went--I knew not where--
7061,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"It was a night of drink, and I awoke"
7062,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"To strange surroundings in a scented room,"
7063,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,A woman with light hair lay by my side
7064,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,“How did I get here”--then the woman laughed--
7065,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"She was a Fury, for the Furies had me."
7066,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"Out of the house I ran, from place to place,"
7067,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"All day went wandering in the city, thus"
7068,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"My wanderings of ten years began, they seem"
7069,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Ten centuries. What do you think of this?
7070,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,"I’m fifty-seven, with a bad complex,"
7071,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,Can you unravel it and make me well?
7072,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
7073,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
7074,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
7075,MONSIEUR D---- TO THE PSYCHOANALYST,
7076,THE LAST CONFESSION,THE LAST CONFESSION
7077,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7078,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7079,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Dear, if you knew how my poor heart"
7080,THE LAST CONFESSION,Aches for your heart by day and night--
7081,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Forever lost to life’s delight,"
7082,THE LAST CONFESSION,"As seasons pass and years depart,"
7083,THE LAST CONFESSION,You would not let the invisible flame
7084,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Of hatred sear and scar your soul,"
7085,THE LAST CONFESSION,Where once in living light my name
7086,THE LAST CONFESSION,Was lettered like an aureole!
7087,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7088,THE LAST CONFESSION,"You, who lost faith in me, will not"
7089,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Believe this last confession, made"
7090,THE LAST CONFESSION,To lift your spirit from the shade
7091,THE LAST CONFESSION,Wherein it walks and views the spot
7092,THE LAST CONFESSION,Of my offense. But when I saw
7093,THE LAST CONFESSION,"That our love’s life must have an end,"
7094,THE LAST CONFESSION,I looked back o’er our path with awe
7095,THE LAST CONFESSION,And traced it toward us to the sign
7096,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Where our ways severed, yours and mine."
7097,THE LAST CONFESSION,There stood Remorse’s dreaded shape!
7098,THE LAST CONFESSION,Your Disbelief! Your Self-Contempt!
7099,THE LAST CONFESSION,I saw our love was not exempt
7100,THE LAST CONFESSION,From ruin and could not escape.
7101,THE LAST CONFESSION,"We could not separate and smile,"
7102,THE LAST CONFESSION,And keep a faithful thought the while
7103,THE LAST CONFESSION,Of understanding (like a spring
7104,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Hidden, refreshing, murmuring)"
7105,THE LAST CONFESSION,As friend sometimes takes leave of friend.
7106,THE LAST CONFESSION,Then what was left? It was this thought
7107,THE LAST CONFESSION,That at the last came forth to slay
7108,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Your love, without a warning brought"
7109,THE LAST CONFESSION,Ere my lips tightened to betray!
7110,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7111,THE LAST CONFESSION,For as our love found depths too deep;
7112,THE LAST CONFESSION,As absence almost deadened sense;
7113,THE LAST CONFESSION,As often I awoke from sleep
7114,THE LAST CONFESSION,"And looked for hours at you, all tense,"
7115,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Lest you awake and see my eyes,"
7116,THE LAST CONFESSION,Where the one thought of purest love
7117,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Shone like a fixed star’s paradise,"
7118,THE LAST CONFESSION,I learned to know that Self above--
7119,THE LAST CONFESSION,Making the heart’s hierarchy pure--
7120,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Stands the archangel Truth, preferred--"
7121,THE LAST CONFESSION,Throned over Love which can endure
7122,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Only where Truth has stood, unstirred."
7123,THE LAST CONFESSION,Watchful and with his torch of stars
7124,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Held o’er Love’s face, although it shows"
7125,THE LAST CONFESSION,"The forehead’s pain, the bosom’s scars,"
7126,THE LAST CONFESSION,The cheeks bleached out from secret tears
7127,THE LAST CONFESSION,"In memory of impalpable blows,"
7128,THE LAST CONFESSION,Shed in the night’s long solitude.
7129,THE LAST CONFESSION,You see I could not give you truth!
7130,THE LAST CONFESSION,There was the Shadow in my life
7131,THE LAST CONFESSION,Cast by the fierce Sun of my youth.
7132,THE LAST CONFESSION,And as our day fell to the west
7133,THE LAST CONFESSION,The Shadow lengthened and the strife
7134,THE LAST CONFESSION,’Twixt Love and Truth within my breast
7135,THE LAST CONFESSION,Waxed fiercer. Heaven’s deathless blue
7136,THE LAST CONFESSION,Leaned on my hungering soul and pained
7137,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Its wings, as if a joy were lost,"
7138,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Or never had been quite attained,"
7139,THE LAST CONFESSION,Or captured at too great a cost.
7140,THE LAST CONFESSION,I could not give you truth all true.
7141,THE LAST CONFESSION,My love for you and then the thirst
7142,THE LAST CONFESSION,"For all your love, made me accursed"
7143,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Of fear that if you knew me first,"
7144,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Just as I am, your heart would cease"
7145,THE LAST CONFESSION,To cherish mine. And then much more
7146,THE LAST CONFESSION,Was this fear venom to my peace
7147,THE LAST CONFESSION,When all the world spread out before
7148,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Our astonished eyes, as our own world,"
7149,THE LAST CONFESSION,"And we its children, each for each."
7150,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7151,THE LAST CONFESSION,This was the sleepless worm which curled
7152,THE LAST CONFESSION,"In my heart’s petals, at the root"
7153,THE LAST CONFESSION,Where my heart’s sweetness had its source.
7154,THE LAST CONFESSION,You never saw the worm! My speech
7155,THE LAST CONFESSION,Poised like a bee who knows the loot
7156,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Of honey’s gone, and turns his course."
7157,THE LAST CONFESSION,"I kept the petals closed, and you"
7158,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Breathed at their tips, but would have known"
7159,THE LAST CONFESSION,"All of their fragrance, or of blight."
7160,THE LAST CONFESSION,That’s love--to have no place where light
7161,THE LAST CONFESSION,And understanding have not shone.
7162,THE LAST CONFESSION,Your face reproached me--I who knew
7163,THE LAST CONFESSION,No sweet or bitter essences
7164,THE LAST CONFESSION,Can be withheld from Love that keeps
7165,THE LAST CONFESSION,"An onward flight, which ever sees,"
7166,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Or would see, all in the heart’s deeps."
7167,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7168,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Then Life came, and with lifted sword"
7169,THE LAST CONFESSION,Laid on our souls his dread command;
7170,THE LAST CONFESSION,"“Say your farewells, part hand from hand,"
7171,THE LAST CONFESSION,"You the adorer, and adored."
7172,THE LAST CONFESSION,Duty is seeking you! And Grief
7173,THE LAST CONFESSION,Would have her child return and see
7174,THE LAST CONFESSION,"The changeless halls of Misery,"
7175,THE LAST CONFESSION,And the bare board and darkened hearth.”
7176,THE LAST CONFESSION,I reeled with anguish as the earth
7177,THE LAST CONFESSION,Sank from my feet. For oh the end
7178,THE LAST CONFESSION,Seemed far as death! And when it came
7179,THE LAST CONFESSION,"It was my hope, my soul’s desire"
7180,THE LAST CONFESSION,"To part as friend may part from friend,"
7181,THE LAST CONFESSION,And that you’d keep alive my name
7182,THE LAST CONFESSION,Bright as an altar’s quenchless fire.
7183,THE LAST CONFESSION,It could not be! How could it be?
7184,THE LAST CONFESSION,I was not truth! I was not true--
7185,THE LAST CONFESSION,I kept my soul’s real self from you.
7186,THE LAST CONFESSION,Then I bethought me: “Since his earth
7187,THE LAST CONFESSION,Is Autumn-stricken with a doubt
7188,THE LAST CONFESSION,"That I am worth not his love’s worth,"
7189,THE LAST CONFESSION,Were it no better he should know
7190,THE LAST CONFESSION,Disloyalty made definite
7191,THE LAST CONFESSION,"By a suspected past re-knit,"
7192,THE LAST CONFESSION,"And see our love a play played out,"
7193,THE LAST CONFESSION,Than to live through the soft decline
7194,THE LAST CONFESSION,Of our bright day to solemn eve--
7195,THE LAST CONFESSION,A sunset of remembrance--where
7196,THE LAST CONFESSION,He walks devoured by love and hate--
7197,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Love for the love I strove to give,"
7198,THE LAST CONFESSION,Hate for a thought intuitive:
7199,THE LAST CONFESSION,Some newer love her heart hath won
7200,THE LAST CONFESSION,Or some first love hath won her back.
7201,THE LAST CONFESSION,"No, to my faith, he says, “I’ll cleave,"
7202,THE LAST CONFESSION,Believing that I can’t believe.”
7203,THE LAST CONFESSION,“Slow death to love! Exquisite rack!”
7204,THE LAST CONFESSION,Ah me! I had not made this fate--
7205,THE LAST CONFESSION,"The warp was stretched, the woof was spun,"
7206,THE LAST CONFESSION,The roof-tree laid long years before
7207,THE LAST CONFESSION,You entered at the unbolted door.
7208,THE LAST CONFESSION,“Then what is best? What can be done?
7209,THE LAST CONFESSION,"To give him back his pride and strength,"
7210,THE LAST CONFESSION,And even his peace of mind at length?
7211,THE LAST CONFESSION,Better a quick blow! Better blood!
7212,THE LAST CONFESSION,To brace the soul and poise the brain
7213,THE LAST CONFESSION,And make him what he was again.”
7214,THE LAST CONFESSION,Just then the Shadow near me stood
7215,THE LAST CONFESSION,Who stepped aside for you. He took
7216,THE LAST CONFESSION,With unabated comradeship
7217,THE LAST CONFESSION,My hand in his. That closed our book.
7218,THE LAST CONFESSION,I woke to hear the water drip
7219,THE LAST CONFESSION,Blown out of heavens low and dim.
7220,THE LAST CONFESSION,He brushed my tears off with his hand--
7221,THE LAST CONFESSION,Nor clouds nor memory trouble him.
7222,THE LAST CONFESSION,And my one thought of you was this:
7223,THE LAST CONFESSION,I’ve cured you with this sacrifice--
7224,THE LAST CONFESSION,The hate has come to you I planned.
7225,THE LAST CONFESSION,"The hate that may take form in words,"
7226,THE LAST CONFESSION,For scorn like this: “I found a seam
7227,THE LAST CONFESSION,“Right at the contact of our love.
7228,THE LAST CONFESSION,“No recreative fire can warm
7229,THE LAST CONFESSION,"“And fuse fine gold with lifeless dross,"
7230,THE LAST CONFESSION,“Or worthy metal make thereof.”
7231,THE LAST CONFESSION,This killed your love and wrecked your dream!
7232,THE LAST CONFESSION,"This is my soul’s confession. Wait,"
7233,THE LAST CONFESSION,A trickster in a hooded form
7234,THE LAST CONFESSION,Stands by as we begin to pull
7235,THE LAST CONFESSION,"The weaving beam, and throws between"
7236,THE LAST CONFESSION,The warp and woof a ball of wool.
7237,THE LAST CONFESSION,It catches and is woven in
7238,THE LAST CONFESSION,"The colors, spoils the conscious blend,"
7239,THE LAST CONFESSION,Changes the pattern to the end.
7240,THE LAST CONFESSION,Whatever it be I call it fate.
7241,THE LAST CONFESSION,In misery or in happiness
7242,THE LAST CONFESSION,We must live on awhile no less.
7243,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Shall we be master weavers, climb,"
7244,THE LAST CONFESSION,"Or leave the loom, or waste the time?"
7245,THE LAST CONFESSION,Or guide the shuttle till the threads
7246,THE LAST CONFESSION,Weave clear or turn to worthless shreds?
7247,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7248,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7249,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7250,THE LAST CONFESSION,
7251,IN THE LOGGIA,IN THE LOGGIA
7252,IN THE LOGGIA,
7253,IN THE LOGGIA,
7254,IN THE LOGGIA,There were seven nights of the moon
7255,IN THE LOGGIA,"This August, beloved."
7256,IN THE LOGGIA,There were nights before the seven
7257,IN THE LOGGIA,"When we scarcely saw the moon,"
7258,IN THE LOGGIA,"Or perhaps as we canoed, ere the sun sank,"
7259,IN THE LOGGIA,We saw her as a transparent tissue of white
7260,IN THE LOGGIA,Against a sky as white.
7261,IN THE LOGGIA,But when we first saw the moon
7262,IN THE LOGGIA,She had risen before the sun had sunk.
7263,IN THE LOGGIA,Then the next night she was brighter
7264,IN THE LOGGIA,"With the evening planet above her,"
7265,IN THE LOGGIA,Despite the tongues of fire in the west
7266,IN THE LOGGIA,Where the sun had set on fire
7267,IN THE LOGGIA,Great coils of cloud!
7268,IN THE LOGGIA,And then there were those nights between
7269,IN THE LOGGIA,Her growth and her o’erflowing fullness
7270,IN THE LOGGIA,When hand in hand we walked in your garden
7271,IN THE LOGGIA,"Amid the Chinese balloons and coreopsis,"
7272,IN THE LOGGIA,"Hibiscus, marigold, hydrangeas,"
7273,IN THE LOGGIA,"Under the rose arches,"
7274,IN THE LOGGIA,"And by the hedge of California privet,"
7275,IN THE LOGGIA,"And looked at the lake,"
7276,IN THE LOGGIA,And the moon in the sky
7277,IN THE LOGGIA,And the moon on the lake.
7278,IN THE LOGGIA,
7279,IN THE LOGGIA,And do you remember what we saw
7280,IN THE LOGGIA,As we stared at the wake of the moon
7281,IN THE LOGGIA,On the lake?
7282,IN THE LOGGIA,"The ripples made blacknesses,"
7283,IN THE LOGGIA,"And the moon made silver splendors,"
7284,IN THE LOGGIA,And as we stared we saw
7285,IN THE LOGGIA,In the shadows of waves
7286,IN THE LOGGIA,Running into the light of the moon on the water
7287,IN THE LOGGIA,Youths and maids and children
7288,IN THE LOGGIA,"Coming from darkness into the light in a dance,"
7289,IN THE LOGGIA,"Joining hands, falling into embraces,"
7290,IN THE LOGGIA,Hurrying to evanishment at the path of light
7291,IN THE LOGGIA,Where the moon had paved the water.
7292,IN THE LOGGIA,I shall never see the moon on the water
7293,IN THE LOGGIA,"Without seeing these youths and maids and children,"
7294,IN THE LOGGIA,And without thinking of that night
7295,IN THE LOGGIA,Of the full moon!
7296,IN THE LOGGIA,
7297,IN THE LOGGIA,This was the night
7298,IN THE LOGGIA,"We saw the moon rise, from the very first,"
7299,IN THE LOGGIA,Across the lake o’ertopping the forest.
7300,IN THE LOGGIA,A spire of pine stood up
7301,IN THE LOGGIA,Against a sky made pale as of the northern lights.
7302,IN THE LOGGIA,But in a moment a bit of fire lit the spire of the pine
7303,IN THE LOGGIA,As it were a candle lighted.
7304,IN THE LOGGIA,And she rose so fast that I took my watch
7305,IN THE LOGGIA,To time the rising of the moon
7306,IN THE LOGGIA,Free and clear of the spire.
7307,IN THE LOGGIA,And she rose so fast that as we gazed
7308,IN THE LOGGIA,"She cleared the spire,"
7309,IN THE LOGGIA,"And soared with such silent glory above the forest,"
7310,IN THE LOGGIA,And sailed to the southwest of the spire.
7311,IN THE LOGGIA,And at that moment the whippoorwills
7312,IN THE LOGGIA,Began to sing in the woodlands near--
7313,IN THE LOGGIA,We had not heard them before in all this summer.
7314,IN THE LOGGIA,And we stood in the loggia
7315,IN THE LOGGIA,"In the silence of our own thoughts,"
7316,IN THE LOGGIA,In the silence of the full moon!
7317,IN THE LOGGIA,
7318,IN THE LOGGIA,And it was then that the pressure of your hand
7319,IN THE LOGGIA,Gave me a meaning of sorrow.
7320,IN THE LOGGIA,It was then that the pressure of your hand
7321,IN THE LOGGIA,"Spoke, as flame which turns in the wind,"
7322,IN THE LOGGIA,Of a change in your heart.
7323,IN THE LOGGIA,"But if not a change, of another’s heart"
7324,IN THE LOGGIA,Toward whom you turned.
7325,IN THE LOGGIA,
7326,IN THE LOGGIA,And I sit in the loggia to-night
7327,IN THE LOGGIA,"Waiting for the moon to rise,"
7328,IN THE LOGGIA,"She will not rise till midnight,"
7329,IN THE LOGGIA,"And then she will rise, a poor half wreck of herself."
7330,IN THE LOGGIA,"No whippoorwill has sung to-night,"
7331,IN THE LOGGIA,And none will sing.
7332,IN THE LOGGIA,And if there are youths and maids and children
7333,IN THE LOGGIA,"Hurrying into the dance on the water,"
7334,IN THE LOGGIA,"Embracing and fading in light,"
7335,IN THE LOGGIA,I shall not see.
7336,IN THE LOGGIA,"No, in this darkness where I breathe"
7337,IN THE LOGGIA,The scent of the sweet alyssum
7338,IN THE LOGGIA,Which you planted and tended
7339,IN THE LOGGIA,"I shall wait for midnight,"
7340,IN THE LOGGIA,And the rise of our ruined moon.
7341,IN THE LOGGIA,
7342,IN THE LOGGIA,In the darkness of the loggia
7343,IN THE LOGGIA,"Under a sky that hopes for no moon to-night,"
7344,IN THE LOGGIA,"Save the wasted moon of midnight,"
7345,IN THE LOGGIA,I am filled with a deep happiness
7346,IN THE LOGGIA,And a thankfulness to the Power
7347,IN THE LOGGIA,Behind the sky:
7348,IN THE LOGGIA,I am filled with a joy as wide and deep as nature
7349,IN THE LOGGIA,That my love for you
7350,IN THE LOGGIA,"Can live without your love for me,"
7351,IN THE LOGGIA,"And asks nothing of you,"
7352,IN THE LOGGIA,And nothing for you
7353,IN THE LOGGIA,Save that you find what you seek!
7354,IN THE LOGGIA,
7355,IN THE LOGGIA,
7356,IN THE LOGGIA,
7357,IN THE LOGGIA,
7358,BE WITH ME THROUGH THE SPRING,BE WITH ME THROUGH THE SPRING

7417,THE SEARCH,Whether you weep or play.
7418,THE SEARCH,
7419,THE SEARCH,Where Little Boy Blue and the Knave of Hearts
7420,THE SEARCH,And the Goose Girl dance on the green;
7421,THE SEARCH,Where Knights in red and gold ride forth
7422,THE SEARCH,Guarding the King and Queen;
7423,THE SEARCH,
7424,THE SEARCH,Where the glint of swords is the only light
7425,THE SEARCH,On a passing storm of men;

7429,THE SEARCH,Galloping in the quest:
7430,THE SEARCH,"One wears black and one wears yellow,"

7432,THE SEARCH,

7442,THE SEARCH,
7443,THE SEARCH,They pass through a village where
7444,THE SEARCH,Some boys are flying kites.
7445,THE SEARCH,The people come with food and wine
7446,THE SEARCH,To entertain the Knights.
7447,THE SEARCH,
7448,THE SEARCH,"And one takes bread and one takes cake,"

7450,THE SEARCH,"And two drink for their heart’s delight,"

7452,THE SEARCH,
7453,THE SEARCH,And the Knight in red slips off to a tavern
7454,THE SEARCH,"And drinks him deep and strong,"
7455,THE SEARCH,And then he hurries to catch his fellows
7456,THE SEARCH,And hails them with a song.
7457,THE SEARCH,
7458,THE SEARCH,They come to a village that lay
7459,THE SEARCH,Within a King’s domains:
7460,THE SEARCH,The Knight in yellow takes his sword
7461,THE SEARCH,And strikes away the chains.
7462,THE SEARCH,
7463,THE SEARCH,They come to a place of festival
7464,THE SEARCH,Through which there passed a hearse:
7465,THE SEARCH,The Knight in black reins in his steed
7466,THE SEARCH,To look thereon and curse.
7467,THE SEARCH,
7468,THE SEARCH,They come to a hall of curious books
7469,THE SEARCH,Under a mountain peak:
7470,THE SEARCH,The Knight in the scholar’s cloak goes in
7471,THE SEARCH,And talks with them in Greek.
7472,THE SEARCH,
7473,THE SEARCH,And all the way by the winding river
7474,THE SEARCH,By heaven’s breeze unfurled
7475,THE SEARCH,The tiger banner and dragon banner
7476,THE SEARCH,Flutter around the world.
7477,THE SEARCH,
7478,THE SEARCH,As night drew down they come to a palace
7479,THE SEARCH,"Of laughter, lights and din."
7480,THE SEARCH,"Says the Knight in red, “I tarry here,"
7481,THE SEARCH,For I hear the violin.”
7482,THE SEARCH,
7483,THE SEARCH,"“Nay,” says the Knight in yellow dressed;"
7484,THE SEARCH,"“Nay,” says the Knight in black;"
7485,THE SEARCH,"“Nay,” says the scholar, “I sleep in the open"
7486,THE SEARCH,To study the Zodiac.”
7487,THE SEARCH,
7488,THE SEARCH,Out comes to them an equerry
7489,THE SEARCH,And sees their piteous dole:
7490,THE SEARCH,"“Come in,” says the ruddy equerry,"
7491,THE SEARCH,“And dine with Old King Cole.”
7492,THE SEARCH,
7493,THE SEARCH,He seized their horses ere they could turn
7494,THE SEARCH,"And led them where candles shone,"
7495,THE SEARCH,And there with a crown tipped on his head
7496,THE SEARCH,Sat the monarch on his throne.
7497,THE SEARCH,
7498,THE SEARCH,"“What is your name, all yellow dight,"
7499,THE SEARCH,And where does your sovereign reign?”
7500,THE SEARCH,The sorrowful Knight then answered the King:
7501,THE SEARCH,“I’m traveling back to Spain.”
7502,THE SEARCH,
7503,THE SEARCH,"“What is your name, all dressed in black,"
7504,THE SEARCH,And whither do you roam?”
7505,THE SEARCH,“I was a mad prince they sent to England
7506,THE SEARCH,And now I’m going home.”
7507,THE SEARCH,
7508,THE SEARCH,"“What is your name, in a scholar’s cloak,"
7509,THE SEARCH,And what is your heart’s joy?”
7510,THE SEARCH,“I search through Europe night and day
7511,THE SEARCH,For a spouse for Helen of Troy.”
7512,THE SEARCH,
7513,THE SEARCH,"“They’re as mad as hatters,” said King Cole"
7514,THE SEARCH,As he straightened his crown on his head.
7515,THE SEARCH,"“Go call in the fiddlers, bring my bowl,"
7516,THE SEARCH,"Fetch me my pipe,” he said."
7517,THE SEARCH,
7518,THE SEARCH,"“But hold,” said Cole, “who are you, fellow,"
7519,THE SEARCH,“Now answer me fair and well?”
7520,THE SEARCH,"“I was born in France,” said the Knight in red,"
7521,THE SEARCH,“And my name’s Pantagruel.”
7522,THE SEARCH,
7523,THE SEARCH,"“That’s a good name,” laughed old King Cole."
7524,THE SEARCH,“But whither are you bound?”
7525,THE SEARCH,"“I search for the Holy Bottle, King,"
7526,THE SEARCH,“And I pray it may be found.”
7527,THE SEARCH,
7528,THE SEARCH,"“That’s a true answer,” said Old King Cole,"
7529,THE SEARCH,“And here you shall abide;
7530,THE SEARCH,"“Come up to my throne and reign forever,"
7531,THE SEARCH,“And sit you by my side.”
7532,THE SEARCH,
7533,THE SEARCH,"“Away with the rest,” said Old King Cole,"
7534,THE SEARCH,"“And fetch my bowl,” said he."
7535,THE SEARCH,"“Here is Pantagruel found at last,"
7536,THE SEARCH,“To keep me company.”
7537,THE SEARCH,
7538,THE SEARCH,From under the throne he drew the bottle
7539,THE SEARCH,And poured wine into the bowl;
7540,THE SEARCH,Pantagruel stepped to the dais
7541,THE SEARCH,And drank with Old King Cole.
7542,THE SEARCH,
7543,THE SEARCH,“Give yellow and black and scholar’s cloak
7544,THE SEARCH,A bed in the royal room.”
7545,THE SEARCH,But Old King Cole and Pantagruel
7546,THE SEARCH,Drank till the morning’s bloom.
7547,THE SEARCH,
7548,THE SEARCH,"They laughed and drank till the dawn was red,"
7549,THE SEARCH,While the sleepers prayed and wept.
7550,THE SEARCH,"They sang to the violins till day,"
7551,THE SEARCH,While black and yellow slept.
7552,THE SEARCH,
7553,THE SEARCH,"But Old King Cole, the merry old soul,"
7554,THE SEARCH,Was a curious soul as well:
7555,THE SEARCH,"“Who are these fellows,” queried he"
7556,THE SEARCH,Of his friend Pantagruel.
7557,THE SEARCH,
7558,THE SEARCH,"“Well, never ask me,” said Pantagruel,"
7559,THE SEARCH,“I met them down by the river;
7560,THE SEARCH,“But whether they came from the Land of Lanterns
7561,THE SEARCH,“They’re traveling on forever.”
7562,THE SEARCH,
7563,THE SEARCH,They went to the room with a candle light
7564,THE SEARCH,And looked in the face of the three--
7565,THE SEARCH,"“They’re a sorry lot,” said Old King Cole;"
7566,THE SEARCH,"“They’re a sorry lot,” said he."
7567,THE SEARCH,
7568,THE SEARCH,"They held the candle to gray beard’s face,"
7569,THE SEARCH,And gray beard moaned in his rest.
7570,THE SEARCH,And pricked in color of India ink
7571,THE SEARCH,Was a windmill on his breast.
7572,THE SEARCH,
7573,THE SEARCH,"The other muttered “Life is a shadow,”"
7574,THE SEARCH,And his face was young and pale:
7575,THE SEARCH,And pricked on his arm was a green serpent
7576,THE SEARCH,Devouring its own tail.
7577,THE SEARCH,
7578,THE SEARCH,The other sighed: “I still must struggle
7579,THE SEARCH,And strive until I die.”
7580,THE SEARCH,And over his heart was pricked the shape
7581,THE SEARCH,Of a wingéd butterfly.
7582,THE SEARCH,
7583,THE SEARCH,"“What do I see,” said Old King Cole,"
7584,THE SEARCH,“Has the wine gone into my brain?
7585,THE SEARCH,“Who’s Helen of Troy? Who’d leave England?
7586,THE SEARCH,“And who’d return to Spain?”
7587,THE SEARCH,
7588,THE SEARCH,Pantagruel and Old King Cole
7589,THE SEARCH,"Slip down the stairs in stealth,"
7590,THE SEARCH,They fill the bowl from the Holy Bottle
7591,THE SEARCH,And drink each other’s health.
7592,THE SEARCH,
7593,THE SEARCH,They stand at the window to watch the sun
7594,THE SEARCH,And the mists of morning clear:
7595,THE SEARCH,"Three knights on horses climb the hill,"
7596,THE SEARCH,And silently disappear.
7597,THE SEARCH,
7598,THE SEARCH,And yellow and black and scholar’s cloak
7599,THE SEARCH,Into the light have gone;
7600,THE SEARCH,And the tiger banner and dragon banner
7601,THE SEARCH,Flutter against the dawn.
7602,THE SEARCH,
7603,THE SEARCH,"“There’s the dragon banner,” says Old King Cole,"
7604,THE SEARCH,"“And the tiger banner,” he sighs."
