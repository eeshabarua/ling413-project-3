56,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
57,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"SARAH CHAUNCEY WOOLSEY (Susan Coolidge) was born in Cleveland, Ohio,"
58,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"January 29, 1835. Her father, John M. Woolsey, a New Yorker, had come"
59,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"to Cleveland to attend to property owned by his father, and had there"
60,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"met Jane Andrews, a charming and graceful girl from Connecticut, whom"
61,SUSAN COOLIDGE,he made his wife.
62,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
63,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Their home was on Euclid Avenue, and comprised about five acres in"
64,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"house-lot, garden, orchard, pasture, and woodland. Here came into the"
65,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"world a family of four girls and a boy,—all vigorous and active and"
66,SUSAN COOLIDGE,full of life. Sarah was the eldest and the predestined leader of the
67,SUSAN COOLIDGE,little tribe. They grew up as children of that day did under similar
68,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"conditions. There was the regular old-fashioned schooling, not too"
69,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"exacting or strenuous, and much wholesome out-of-door life. There were"
70,SUSAN COOLIDGE,horses and dogs and cattle and birds for the children to care for and
71,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"play with, and much climbing and romping were permitted in a place"
72,SUSAN COOLIDGE,where no near neighbors could be disturbed. To the other children
73,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"life was a joyous holiday, diversified with small disappointments"
74,SUSAN COOLIDGE,and dismays; but to Sarah the sky and the earth held boundless
75,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"anticipations and intentions, and the world was a place of enchantment."
76,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
77,SUSAN COOLIDGE,She was always individual from the moment she first opened her big
78,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"brown eyes—passionately loving and passionately wilful, with heroic"
79,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"intentions and desires, and with remorse and disappointments in"
80,SUSAN COOLIDGE,proportion. Part of the woodland where the axe had not yet done
81,SUSAN COOLIDGE,its work of cutting and clipping was given to the children for a
82,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"playground. They called it “Paradise,” and for all of them it was a"
83,SUSAN COOLIDGE,place of rapture and mystery. To the others it was full of hiding
84,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"places,—to little Sarah the hiding places were bowers. They looked for"
85,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"eggs and birds’ nests, and had thrilling encounters with furry wild"
86,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"creatures, which fled at their approach; but her intercourse was all"
87,SUSAN COOLIDGE,with the fairies and elves and gnomes which peopled the place. After a
88,SUSAN COOLIDGE,time they felt the presence of the fairies too; but it was under the
89,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"influence of her enthusiastic imagination, which controlled their"
90,SUSAN COOLIDGE,own more mundane perceptions. With her for a leader they often passed
91,SUSAN COOLIDGE,into a new world of romance and adventure and high undertakings. They
92,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"lived in battlemented castles, attended by knights and squires, with"
93,SUSAN COOLIDGE,danger on all sides met by lofty courage; or they rode on elephants
94,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"in India, always on dignified missions, attended by great pomp and"
95,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"ceremony; or they lived with fairies, whose gifts might crop up under"
96,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"every toadstool. To be sure, the elephant on which they made their"
97,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"proud progress might at other times, stripped of his trappings, be"
98,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"serviceable as a nursery table, and the fairy gifts were apt to bear"
99,SUSAN COOLIDGE,a prosaic resemblance to certain well-known and well-worn nursery
100,SUSAN COOLIDGE,properties; but invested with the mystery and romance cast upon them by
101,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Sarah’s vivid imagination, the little band went, as she led them, into"
102,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"the land of dreams, and felt no incongruity."
103,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
104,SUSAN COOLIDGE,Her education went on much as she chose. The best teachers available
105,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"were employed, and to each in turn she became a favorite and"
106,SUSAN COOLIDGE,interesting pupil; but though her quick intelligence enabled her
107,SUSAN COOLIDGE,to pass excellent examinations and gave her a foremost place in
108,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"her classes, she really assimilated and retained only what she"
109,SUSAN COOLIDGE,enjoyed. Mathematics she ignored entirely. All scientific problems
110,SUSAN COOLIDGE,fascinated her by their results; but she would not open her mind to
111,SUSAN COOLIDGE,the processes by which the results were reached. For languages she
112,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"had no predilections, though she used her own with singular grace and"
113,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"precision, drawing her words from an apparently limitless vocabulary."
114,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Through life this charming use of language, combined with her keen"
115,SUSAN COOLIDGE,humor and sympathetic appreciation of all that makes life stirring and
116,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"vital, made her a most fascinating companion. Her delight in literature"
117,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"was her real education. From her early youth she revelled in books,"
118,SUSAN COOLIDGE,reading so rapidly that it seemed impossible that she could remember
119,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"what she read; but, in fact, remembering it all! To have looked over a"
120,SUSAN COOLIDGE,poem two or three times was enough to make it a permanent possession.
121,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"She devoured history, biography, romances, and poetry, and with"
122,SUSAN COOLIDGE,intuitive judgment and taste revelled in what was really beautiful and
123,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"interesting, and discarded the second-rate and commonplace. She began"
124,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"writing at a very early age,—fairy stories, verses, and romances,—but"
125,SUSAN COOLIDGE,she never published anything until she had reached full maturity.
126,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Meantime she grew to vigorous, active womanhood, full of interests and"
127,SUSAN COOLIDGE,friendships and delightful experiences of one sort and another. She
128,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"was much loved, and gave such a wealth of self-forgetting, idolizing,"
129,SUSAN COOLIDGE,ardent affection in return that her friends were all lovers. She drew a
130,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"circle of loving admirers about her wherever she went, and was always"
131,SUSAN COOLIDGE,totally unconscious of the charm she worked by her very sweet voice and
132,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"manner, brilliant fun, and warm sympathy."
133,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
134,SUSAN COOLIDGE,The Civil War broke out just as she passed from girlhood to young
135,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"womanhood. It aroused in her a passion of enthusiasm and devotion,"
136,SUSAN COOLIDGE,and she threw herself with all her heart and soul into work for the
137,SUSAN COOLIDGE,soldiers at home and afield. In the Soldiers’ Hospital at New Haven
138,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"she was an enthusiastic helper, in the wards, or storeroom, or linen"
139,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"closet, wherever her energy was most needed. And her leisure was"
140,SUSAN COOLIDGE,filled with knitting or sewing or preparing special diet for the sick
141,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"and wounded. She was a tireless worker then and ever, and nature had"
142,SUSAN COOLIDGE,endowed her with great practical gifts. She was an excellent cook
143,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"and an expert needlewoman, both in plain sewing and the most dainty"
144,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"embroidery, and all work was done with such rapidity and perfection"
145,SUSAN COOLIDGE,that it was a despair for the race of plodders even to watch her swift
146,SUSAN COOLIDGE,achievements.
147,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
148,SUSAN COOLIDGE,From New Haven she went to the Convalescent Hospital established at
149,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Portsmouth Grove, and was one of a band of excellent workers there"
150,SUSAN COOLIDGE,during the second year of the war. It was a very developing and vivid
151,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"experience, and one which she counted among the greatest points of"
152,SUSAN COOLIDGE,interest in her life.
153,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
154,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"When the war was over, her old career of busy, never-slackening"
155,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"industry and purpose began again. It was full, as ever, of friendships"
156,SUSAN COOLIDGE,which could not possibly claim more than she was willing to give.
157,SUSAN COOLIDGE,She naturally drew around her the cleverest men and women of her
158,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"acquaintance, and her society was sought far and near."
159,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
160,SUSAN COOLIDGE,But she did not really begin her life as an author until a few years
161,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"later, when in a grove at Bethlehem, N. H., sitting on a fallen tree,"
162,SUSAN COOLIDGE,she sketched the outline of “The New Year’s Bargain.” She had sent a
163,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"few fugitive articles to certain magazines before this, but only now"
164,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"did she take up writing as a real work. That dainty little book, with"
165,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"its fantastic and graceful imaginings, was so well received by the"
166,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"public that she went on in a different vein, through the series of the"
167,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"“Katy Did” books, where fact and fiction, experience and fancy, were"
168,SUSAN COOLIDGE,so blended that it was hardly possible to say in answer to the eager
169,SUSAN COOLIDGE,questionings of some of her little readers where the one ended and the
170,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"other began. Katy found a large audience, and her biographer went on"
171,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"from children’s books to verses or historical studies, such as “Old"
172,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Convent Days,” or mere editor’s work, like the condensations of those"
173,SUSAN COOLIDGE,famous old diaries of Mrs. Delany and Miss Burney. She was consulting
174,SUSAN COOLIDGE,reader for Roberts Company in the days when the hall-mark of that firm
175,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"was a proof of excellence. She was very industrious, but her literary"
176,SUSAN COOLIDGE,work never seemed the most absorbing part of her life. This was partly
177,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"because of her intense and vivid interest in the rest of life,—the"
178,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"journeys, the visits, and above all the friends,—and largely because"
179,SUSAN COOLIDGE,she was absolutely devoid of literary vanity or self-consciousness.
180,SUSAN COOLIDGE,She seldom talked of her work or referred in any way to her success.
181,SUSAN COOLIDGE,Her verses found a warm welcome in many hearts whose owners were all
182,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"unknown to her, and sometimes she acknowledged, with a sort of tender"
183,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"surprise, that it was a great reward to have been able to help and"
184,SUSAN COOLIDGE,encourage others. But anything like flattery or mere compliment was
185,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"very distasteful to her, and she sometimes owned impatiently that"
186,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"“Susan Coolidge” bored her to death, and she wished she had never heard"
187,SUSAN COOLIDGE,of her!
188,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
189,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"While literature became the chief occupation of her life, her artistic"
190,SUSAN COOLIDGE,temperament and love of the beautiful found expression in many other
191,SUSAN COOLIDGE,ways. She instinctively surrounded herself with beautiful objects and
192,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"colors. Her taste was almost unerring, and harmony of design and softly"
193,SUSAN COOLIDGE,shaded tints seemed to be her natural setting. She transformed every
194,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"room she lived in, were it for a week only."
195,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
196,SUSAN COOLIDGE,She thought little of her drawings in water color. They were all
197,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"flower pieces studied from life, and she was conscious of the little"
198,SUSAN COOLIDGE,instruction she had received and her ignorance of technique. But all
199,SUSAN COOLIDGE,the same these lovely panels were a joy to those who were fortunate
200,SUSAN COOLIDGE,enough to possess them. As was once said by one who was no mean
201,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"artist himself, “She can do what many artists—adepts in technique—fail"
202,SUSAN COOLIDGE,in. She gives us the flower in all its life and spirit.” Her china
203,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"painting—necessarily more conventional—was still charming, holding"
204,SUSAN COOLIDGE,something of her individuality.
205,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
206,SUSAN COOLIDGE,This vivid life of purpose and energy and never-failing zest appeared
207,SUSAN COOLIDGE,to bubble up from such an inexhaustible fountain of vitality that it
208,SUSAN COOLIDGE,seemed as if it might go on for ever. But gradually a shadow stole
209,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"over it—not a very dark one at first, but inexorable. She fought with"
210,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"it, played with it, defied it, but it was always there! She could not"
211,SUSAN COOLIDGE,acknowledge defeat and was always planning for the future with gay
212,SUSAN COOLIDGE,self-confidence; but the shadow grew! By and by the narrowing limits
213,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"shut her in her chamber, but even then she looked out upon the days"
214,SUSAN COOLIDGE,to come with undaunted courage. The chamber was not like a sick room.
215,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"It was bright with sunshine and the sparkle of fire, and scented and"
216,SUSAN COOLIDGE,gay with the flowers she so dearly loved. Here she read and wrote and
217,SUSAN COOLIDGE,saw her many friends. From hence came words of rejoicing for all her
218,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"dear ones who were happy, and words of truest sympathy for those who"
219,SUSAN COOLIDGE,were sad. She was one of the few people to whom the joys and sorrows
220,SUSAN COOLIDGE,of others are of equal importance to their own. She pondered over the
221,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"lives of her friends with never-ending interest, and gave at every turn"
222,SUSAN COOLIDGE,and crisis the truest and most comprehending sympathy. No wonder that
223,SUSAN COOLIDGE,so many warmed hands and hearts by that generous flame!
224,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
225,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Slowly the shadow deepened. She was disturbed by it, but still wrote"
226,SUSAN COOLIDGE,happily of the future and filled it with plans and purposes. But one
227,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"day, April 9, 1905, very gently, Death’s finger touched her. She was"
228,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"not conscious of pain or trouble, “only a new sensation,” but she"
229,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"closed her eyes, and without a word of farewell, was gone away from us."
230,SUSAN COOLIDGE,
231,SUSAN COOLIDGE,It is hard to sum up such a life. It was a very full and happy one.
232,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"She gave much, but received much. She loved beauty, and she was always"
233,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"surrounded by it. She loved friendship, and nobody had more or better"
234,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"friends. She gave them of her best, but she drew their best from them."
235,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"Hers was an ideal companionship, so full of appreciative interest and"
236,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"sympathy, so illuminated by wit and humor. She was ardent and eager"
237,SUSAN COOLIDGE,in her plans of life. Nothing could exceed the absorption and energy
238,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"with which she carried them out. But she accepted disappointment, after"
239,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"a little struggle, with a gay _insouciance_. So when the final defeat"
240,SUSAN COOLIDGE,"came she seemed to resign herself without struggle to the inevitable,"
241,SUSAN COOLIDGE,and to those of us who loved her best it seemed as if that sweet and
242,SUSAN COOLIDGE,brilliant and unwearied spirit had only folded its wings for a moment
243,SUSAN COOLIDGE,before taking a longer and surer flight.

1085,THROUGH THE CLOUD,And the elm-fringed intervale.
1086,THROUGH THE CLOUD,
1087,THROUGH THE CLOUD,"We gazed in a puzzled wonder,"

1115,THROUGH THE CLOUD,And a pink cloud floated through.
1116,THROUGH THE CLOUD,
1117,THROUGH THE CLOUD,And I thought of some heavy-hearted ones
1118,THROUGH THE CLOUD,Whose world had suddenly changed
1119,THROUGH THE CLOUD,To a whirl of mist and driving cloud
1120,THROUGH THE CLOUD,"From all fair things estranged,"
1121,THROUGH THE CLOUD,
1122,THROUGH THE CLOUD,And who sat and wearily wondered
1123,THROUGH THE CLOUD,"If ever the world seemed bright,"
1124,THROUGH THE CLOUD,And half believed that joy was a dream
1125,THROUGH THE CLOUD,Which fled with the flying night;
1126,THROUGH THE CLOUD,
1127,THROUGH THE CLOUD,"And how, by little and little,"
1128,THROUGH THE CLOUD,"The clouds were tinged with sun,"

1844,A SUMMER SONG,"SING thyself out, sweet summer, leave not a note unsung;"
1845,A SUMMER SONG,"Smile to the end, dear summer, dimpling on land and sea,"
1846,A SUMMER SONG,"Voice all the praise of the roses, O bells of the lily which rung"
1847,A SUMMER SONG,"The holiday signal for the world, heard by my heart and me!"
1848,A SUMMER SONG,
1849,A SUMMER SONG,"The earth it was weary of winter, of the frost and the tingling snow,"
1850,A SUMMER SONG,"Of winds which blew from the icy Pole, daunting the faint sun-ray;"
1851,A SUMMER SONG,"And the pulse of life beat fainter, and the fire of hope burned low,"
1852,A SUMMER SONG,"And we yearned for thy coming, summer, and thou wert so far away."
1853,A SUMMER SONG,
1854,A SUMMER SONG,"Then the shy, cool noon shone warmer, and the shrunken veins of earth"
1855,A SUMMER SONG,"Pulsed with a quicker current which glowed in the willow’s stem,"
1856,A SUMMER SONG,"And the frozen graves were opened, and death gave place to birth,"
1857,A SUMMER SONG,"And the drowsy flowers reared their heads, and called the birds to them."
1858,A SUMMER SONG,
1859,A SUMMER SONG,"Back they came trooping blithely, the oriole and the wren,"
1860,A SUMMER SONG,"Robin and jay and hermit-thrush, to twilight-haunted grove;"
1861,A SUMMER SONG,"New nests, new music, and new hopes, in upland and in glen,"
1862,A SUMMER SONG,And all the winter discords turned to harmonies of love.
1863,A SUMMER SONG,
1864,A SUMMER SONG,"O hearts that failed and doubted, and eyes that were blind and wet,"
1865,A SUMMER SONG,"And dared not trust the heavenly love which giveth each good thing,"
1866,A SUMMER SONG,"The Lord he never forgets his world, and he never will forget,"
1867,A SUMMER SONG,And year by year from the graving snows he builds his blessed spring!
1868,A SUMMER SONG,
1869,A SUMMER SONG,"Tell thyself out then, summer, leave not a word unsaid,"
1870,A SUMMER SONG,"Give sun to sky, and dew to earth, and moon to silver sea;"

1883,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"The birds’ songs die away to sleepy croon,"
1884,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"And each white lily on the garden walk,"
1885,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Dew-heavy, hangs its head upon its stalk;"
1886,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,
1887,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"When dawning soft and faint upon the blue,"

1891,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Its pale gold, wayside blossoms near and far,"

1893,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,
1894,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"The freshness of the morning tempts it not,"

1904,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Hail it as sister, but the drowsy bee"

1911,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"And the dim, hovering night shuts darkly down"
1912,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,And all the happy things which feed on day
1913,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,Shiver and shrink and hide themselves away—
1914,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,
1915,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Then, like the primrose with its pale gold star,"
1916,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"They open sudden blooms of love and cheer,"
1917,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Giving out fragrance where no others are,"
1918,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Gilding the heavy hours of doubt and fear,"
1919,AN EVENING PRIMROSE,"Fronting the shadows, till with dawn ends pain,"

1929,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Set by a sick man’s bed;
1930,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"The day was weary, the day was long,"
1931,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"But the rose it spoke with a voice like song,"
1932,A ROSE IN A GLASS,And this is what it said:
1933,A ROSE IN A GLASS,
1934,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"“I know that the wind is keen,"
1935,A ROSE IN A GLASS,And the drifted snows lie deep;
1936,A ROSE IN A GLASS,I know that the cruel ice lies spread
1937,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"O’er the laughing brook and the lake’s blue bed,"
1938,A ROSE IN A GLASS,And the fountain’s rush and leap.
1939,A ROSE IN A GLASS,
1940,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"“I know, I know all this;"
1941,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Yet here I sit—a rose!
1942,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"Smiling I sit, and I feel no fear,"
1943,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"For God is good and the Spring is near,"
1944,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Couched in the shrouding snows.
1945,A ROSE IN A GLASS,
1946,A ROSE IN A GLASS,“Canst thou not smile with me?
1947,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Art thou less strong than I?
1948,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Less strong at heart than a feeble flower
1949,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"Which lives and blossoms but one brief hour,"
1950,A ROSE IN A GLASS,And then must droop and die?
1951,A ROSE IN A GLASS,
1952,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"“Surely, thou canst endure"
1953,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"Thy little pains and fears,"
1954,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"Before whose eyes, all fair and bright,"
1955,A ROSE IN A GLASS,In endless vistas of delight
1956,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Stretch the Eternal Years!”
1957,A ROSE IN A GLASS,
1958,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Then over the sick man’s heart
1959,A ROSE IN A GLASS,Fell a deep and hushed repose.
1960,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"He turned on his pillow and whispered low,"
1961,A ROSE IN A GLASS,That only the listening flower might know:
1962,A ROSE IN A GLASS,"“I thank thee, Rose, dear Rose.”"

2060,THE OLD PINE,"To watch the seasons come and go,"
2061,THE OLD PINE,"In stalwart and unbending lines,"
2062,THE OLD PINE,There stands a row of hoary pines.

2088,THE OLD PINE,"And smote their leader’s lofty head,"

2184,INTERRUPTED,And each for each made room and way.
2185,INTERRUPTED,
2186,INTERRUPTED,I set my wilful feet to tread

2202,INTERRUPTED,Hope changed to grief and smile to frown.
2203,INTERRUPTED,
2204,INTERRUPTED,Then I said sadly: “All is vain;

2220,INTERRUPTED,Which touch and tangle soon or late?
2221,INTERRUPTED,
2222,INTERRUPTED,"“These ‘hindrances’ which made you fret,"

2234,INTERRUPTED,"Forgive me, Lord, my selfish day,"

2289,J. S. W.,"THE voice of Duty, low, but clarion clear,"
2290,J. S. W.,"Found her, safe seated in the golden haze"
2291,J. S. W.,"Of youth and ease, living luxurious days."
2292,J. S. W.,She roused to listen; her enchanted ear
2293,J. S. W.,Heard nevermore the music of the earth—
2294,J. S. W.,"The dancing measure, or the reveler’s call,"
2295,J. S. W.,"Or flute note of Apollo, nor the fall"
2296,J. S. W.,Of Orphic melodies. As nothing worth
2297,J. S. W.,She counted them; in vain her ear to please
2298,J. S. W.,"They rang their varied changes, urged and wooed,"
2299,J. S. W.,"Following swift Duty, leader to all good,"
2300,J. S. W.,She went thenceforward;—so she conquered Ease.
2301,J. S. W.,
2302,J. S. W.,"Then fell her tender feet on harder road,"
2303,J. S. W.,With stones beset and briers and many a thorn;
2304,J. S. W.,"And there, her woman’s strength all overborne,"
2305,J. S. W.,"She sank at length, fainting beneath her load."
2306,J. S. W.,"And time went by, while helpless still she lay,"
2307,J. S. W.,"Shackled by weakness, vexed with hopes and fears,"
2308,J. S. W.,Watching the long and tantalizing years
2309,J. S. W.,Built from the salt sands of her every day;
2310,J. S. W.,But still she bravely smiled through loss and gain;
2311,J. S. W.,"Through the slow ebb of cheer and fortune’s frown,"
2312,J. S. W.,"Her quenchless soul no chilling waves could drown,"
2313,J. S. W.,No fires exhaust;—and so she conquered Pain.
2314,J. S. W.,
2315,J. S. W.,"And, last, the dim, mysterious shape drew near,"
2316,J. S. W.,"Whom men name “Death,” with pale, averted eyes;"
2317,J. S. W.,(But whom the Heavenly ones call otherwise!)
2318,J. S. W.,She met his hovering presence without fear.
2319,J. S. W.,"Long time they strove; and as the Patriarch cried,"
2320,J. S. W.,"“Except thou bless, I will not let thee go”!"
2321,J. S. W.,So she; until at dawn the vanquished foe
2322,J. S. W.,"Utterly blessed, and left her satisfied."
2323,J. S. W.,"Oh, sweet to her the first, long, rapturous breath"
2324,J. S. W.,"Of Heaven, after life’s pent and prisoning air;"
2325,J. S. W.,"Freedom unstinted, power to will and dare"
2326,J. S. W.,The victory won from Life and over Death.

2362,THE YEAR AND THE CENTURY,"Yet He made us both, He loves us both, and now we go to Him.”"
2363,THE YEAR AND THE CENTURY,
2364,THE YEAR AND THE CENTURY,The Old Year shivered as he heard these words of lofty cheer;
2365,THE YEAR AND THE CENTURY,"Then light came to his faded eyes, and courage chased his fear."
2366,THE YEAR AND THE CENTURY,"He felt a strong hand clasp his own, and, held and guided so,"

3451,LITTLE BY LITTLE,HOW does the Spring come? With many mischances.
3452,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now the frost pricketh sore, then the sun glances;"
3453,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now the rain beateth down, then the snow falleth,"
3454,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Nothing the cheery, brave Springtime appalleth."
3455,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Bravely she smiles through the somber chill weather,"
3456,LITTLE BY LITTLE,Smiles on the blight and the promise together;
3457,LITTLE BY LITTLE,And at the end of the long suffering
3458,LITTLE BY LITTLE,All the world over is ruled by the Spring.
3459,LITTLE BY LITTLE,
3460,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"How does the tide come? Not all in one rising,"
3461,LITTLE BY LITTLE,Daunting the land and the heavens surprising;
3462,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Here a wave, there a wave, rising and falling,"
3463,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Billow to billow still beckoning and calling,"
3464,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Heaving, receding, now farther, now nigher,"
3465,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now it is lower, and now it is higher;"
3466,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now it seems spent and tired; then, with insistence,"
3467,LITTLE BY LITTLE,Gaily and strongly it comes from the distance;
3468,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Till, at the end of the plunge and the roar,"
3469,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"It is full tide, and the sea rules the shore."
3470,LITTLE BY LITTLE,
3471,LITTLE BY LITTLE,How does the soul grow? Not all in a minute:
3472,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now it may lose ground, and now it may win it;"
3473,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now it resolves, and again the will faileth;"
3474,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now it rejoiceth, and now it bewaileth;"
3475,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now its hopes fructify, then they are blighted;"
3476,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Now it walks sunnily, now gropes benighted;"
3477,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Fed by discouragements, taught by disaster,"
3478,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"So it goes forward, now slower, now faster,"
3479,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"Till, all the pain past, and failures made whole,"
3480,LITTLE BY LITTLE,"It is full grown, and the Lord rules the soul."

3499,TWO YEARS,"We did not mark how sad the smile and strange,"
3500,TWO YEARS,"But deemed all well, then in a little while"
3501,TWO YEARS,The skies grew dark with swift tempestuous change.
3502,TWO YEARS,
3503,TWO YEARS,"Led by thy hand he vanished from our eyes,"
3504,TWO YEARS,"And thou fulfilled thy date day after day,"
3505,TWO YEARS,And still to grief and question and surmise
3506,TWO YEARS,"Made never answer, keeping on thy way."
3507,TWO YEARS,
3508,TWO YEARS,"But still we love thee, for thou wert the last"
3509,TWO YEARS,"To see the face which we no longer see,"
3510,TWO YEARS,And all the grace and glory of his past
3511,TWO YEARS,Completes and ends and culminates in thee.
3512,TWO YEARS,
3513,TWO YEARS,"The New Year’s hands with good gifts may be full,"
3514,TWO YEARS,"The New Year’s heart with love and peace may brim,"

3516,TWO YEARS,As the old years which caught their best from him.
