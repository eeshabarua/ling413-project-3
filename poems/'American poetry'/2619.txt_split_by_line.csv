2758,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,
2759,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Who is she here that now I see,"
2760,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"This dainty new divinity,"
2761,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Love's sister, Venus' child?  She shows"
2762,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Her hues, white lily and pink rose,"
2763,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,And in her laughing eyes the snares
2764,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,That hearts entangle unawares.
2765,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Ah, woe to men if Love should yield"
2766,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,His arrows to this girl to wield
2767,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Even in play, for she would give"
2768,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Sore wounds that none might take and live.
2769,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Yet no such wanton strain is hers,"
2770,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Nor Leda's child and Jupiter's
2771,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Is she, though swans no softer are"
2772,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Than whom she fairer is by far.
2773,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,For she was born beside the rill
2774,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"That gushes from Parnassus' hill,"
2775,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,And by the bright Pierian spring
2776,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,She shall receive an offering
2777,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,From every youth who pipes a strain
2778,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Beside his flocks upon the plain.
2779,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"But I, the first, this very day,"
2780,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Will tune for her my humble lay,"
2781,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Invoking this new Muse to render
2782,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"My oaten reed more sweet and tender,"
2783,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Within its vibrant hollows wake
2784,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Such dulcet voices for her sake
2785,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"As, curved hand at straining ear,"
2786,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,I long have stood and sought to hear
2787,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Borne with the warm midsummer breeze
2788,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,With scent of hay and hum of bees
2789,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Faintly from far-off Sicily....
2790,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,
2791,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Ah, well I know that not for us"
2792,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Are Virgil and Theocritus,"
2793,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,And that the golden age is past
2794,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Whereof they sang, and thou, the last,"
2795,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Sweet Spenser, of their god-like line,"
2796,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Soar far too swift for verse of mine
2797,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,One strain to compass of your song.
2798,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Yet there are poets that prolong
2799,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Of your rare voice the ravishment
2800,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,In silver cadences; content
2801,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Were I if I could but rehearse
2802,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"One stave of Wither's starry verse,"
2803,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Weave such wrought richness as recalls
2804,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Britannia's lovely Pastorals,"
2805,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Or in some garden-spot suspire
2806,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,One breath of Marvell's magic fire
2807,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,When in the green and leafy shade
2808,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,He sees dissolving all that's made.
2809,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Ah, little Muse still far too high"
2810,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"On weak, clipped wings my wishes fly."
2811,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Transform them then and make them doves,"
2812,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,"Soft-moaning birds that Venus loves,"
2813,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,That they may circle ever low
2814,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Above the abode where you shall grow
2815,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Into your gracious womanhood.
2816,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,And you shall feed the gentle brood
2817,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,From out your hand--content they'll be
2818,TO LITTLE RENEE ON FIRST SEEING HER LYING IN HER CRADLE,Only to coo their songs to thee.

3120,CHOOSING A NAME,I was nigh the first that kissed her.
3121,CHOOSING A NAME,When the nursing-woman brought her
3122,CHOOSING A NAME,"To papa, his infant daughter,"
3123,CHOOSING A NAME,How papa's dear eyes did glisten!

3738,I,I
3739,I,
3740,I,Have you not heard the poets tell
3741,I,How came the dainty Baby Bell
3742,I,Into this world of ours?
3743,I,The gates of heaven were left ajar:
3744,I,"With folded hands and dreamy eyes,"
3745,I,"Wandering out of Paradise,"
3746,I,"She saw this planet, like a star,"
3747,I,Hung in the glistening depths of even--
3748,I,"Its bridges, running to and fro,"
3749,I,"O'er which the white-winged Angels go,"
3750,I,Bearing the holy Dead to heaven.
3751,I,"She touched a bridge of flowers--those feet,"
3752,I,So light they did not bend the bells
3753,I,"Of the celestial asphodels,"
3754,I,They fell like dew upon the flowers:
3755,I,Then all the air grew strangely sweet.
3756,I,And thus came dainty Baby Bell
3757,I,Into this world of ours.
3758,I,
3759,II,II
3760,II,
3761,II,She came and brought delicious May;
3762,II,The swallows built beneath the eaves;
3763,II,"Like sunlight, in and out the leaves"
3764,II,"The robins went, the livelong day;"
3765,II,The lily swung its noiseless bell;
3766,II,And on the porch the slender vine
3767,II,Held out its cups of fairy wine.
3768,II,How tenderly the twilights fell!
3769,II,"Oh, earth was full of singing-birds"
3770,II,"And opening springtide flowers,"
3771,II,When the dainty Baby Bell
3772,II,Came to this world of ours.
3773,II,
3774,III,III
3775,III,
3776,III,"O Baby, dainty Baby Bell,"
3777,III,How fair she grew from day to day!
3778,III,"What woman-nature filled her eyes,"
3779,III,What poetry within them lay--
3780,III,"Those deep and tender twilight eyes,"
3781,III,"So full of meaning, pure and bright"
3782,III,As if she yet stood in the light
3783,III,Of those oped gates of Paradise.
3784,III,And so we loved her more and more:
3785,III,"Ah, never in our hearts before"
3786,III,Was love so lovely born:
3787,III,We felt we had a link between
3788,III,This real world and that unseen--
3789,III,The land beyond the morn;
3790,III,"And for the love of those dear eyes,"
3791,III,"For love of her whom God led forth,"
3792,III,(The mother's being ceased on earth
3793,III,"When Baby came from Paradise,)--"
3794,III,"For love of Him who smote our lives,"
3795,III,"And woke the chords of joy and pain,"
3796,III,"We said, Dear Christ!--our hearts bowed down"
3797,III,Like violets after rain.
3798,III,
3799,IV,IV
3800,IV,
3801,IV,"And now the orchards, which were white"
3802,IV,"And pink with blossoms when she came,"
3803,IV,Were rich in autumn's mellow prime;
3804,IV,"The clustered apples burnt like flame,"
3805,IV,"The folded chestnut burst its shell,"
3806,IV,"The grapes hung purpling, range on range;"
3807,IV,And time wrought just as rich a change
3808,IV,In little Baby Bell.
3809,IV,"Her lissome form more perfect grew,"
3810,IV,"And in her features we could trace,"
3811,IV,"In softened curves, her mother's face."
3812,IV,Her angel-nature ripened too:
3813,IV,"We thought her lovely when she came,"
3814,IV,"But she was holy, saintly now..."
3815,IV,Around her pale angelic brow
3816,IV,We saw a slender ring of flame.
3817,IV,
3818,V,V
3819,V,
3820,V,God's hand had taken away the seal
3821,V,That held the portals of her speech;
3822,V,And oft she said a few strange words
3823,V,Whose meaning lay beyond our reach.
3824,V,"She never was a child to us,"
3825,V,We never held her being's key;
3826,V,We could not teach her holy things
3827,V,Who was Christ's self in purity.
3828,V,
3829,VI,VI
3830,VI,
3831,VI,"It came upon us by degrees,"
3832,VI,We saw its shadow ere it fell--
3833,VI,The knowledge that our God had sent
3834,VI,His messenger for Baby Bell.
3835,VI,"We shuddered with unlanguaged pain,"
3836,VI,"And all our hopes were changed to fears,"
3837,VI,And all our thoughts ran into tears
3838,VI,Like sunshine into rain.
3839,VI,"We cried aloud in our belief,"
3840,VI,"""Oh, smite us gently, gently, God!"
3841,VI,"Teach us to bend and kiss the rod,"
3842,VI,"And perfect grow through grief."""
3843,VI,"Ah! how we loved her, God can tell;"
3844,VI,Her heart was folded deep in ours.
3845,VI,"Our hearts are broken, Baby Bell!"
3846,VI,
3847,VII,VII
3848,VII,
3849,VII,"At last he came, the messenger,"
3850,VII,The messenger from unseen lands:
3851,VII,And what did dainty Baby Bell?
3852,VII,"She only crossed her little hands,"
3853,VII,She only looked more meek and fair!
3854,VII,"We parted back her silken hair,"
3855,VII,We wove the roses round her brow--
3856,VII,"White buds, the summer's drifted snow--"
3857,VII,Wrapped her from head to foot in flowers...
3858,VII,And thus went dainty Baby Bell
3859,VII,Out of this world of ours.

6826,TUCKING THE BABY IN,The dark-fringed eyelids slowly close
6827,TUCKING THE BABY IN,On eyes serene and deep;
6828,TUCKING THE BABY IN,Upon my breast my own sweet child
6829,TUCKING THE BABY IN,Has gently dropped to sleep;
6830,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"I kiss his soft and dimpled cheek,"
6831,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"I kiss his rounded chin,"
6832,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"Then lay him on his little bed,"
6833,TUCKING THE BABY IN,And tuck my baby in.

6838,TUCKING THE BABY IN,That slumbers unafraid;
6839,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"Or like some new embodied soul,"
6840,TUCKING THE BABY IN,Still pure from taint of sin--
6841,TUCKING THE BABY IN,My thoughts are reverent as I stoop
6842,TUCKING THE BABY IN,To tuck my baby in.
6843,TUCKING THE BABY IN,
6844,TUCKING THE BABY IN,What toil must stain these tiny hands
6845,TUCKING THE BABY IN,That now lie still and white?
6846,TUCKING THE BABY IN,What shadows creep across the face
6847,TUCKING THE BABY IN,That shines with morning light?
6848,TUCKING THE BABY IN,These wee pink shoeless feet--how far
6849,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"Shall go their lengthening tread,"
6850,TUCKING THE BABY IN,When they no longer cuddled close
6851,TUCKING THE BABY IN,May rest upon this bed?
6852,TUCKING THE BABY IN,
6853,TUCKING THE BABY IN,O what am I that I should train
6854,TUCKING THE BABY IN,An angel for the skies;
6855,TUCKING THE BABY IN,Or mix the potent draught that feeds
6856,TUCKING THE BABY IN,The soul within these eyes?
6857,TUCKING THE BABY IN,I reach him up to the sinless Hands
6858,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"Before his cares begin,--"
6859,TUCKING THE BABY IN,"Great Father, with Thy folds of love,"
6860,TUCKING THE BABY IN,O tuck my baby in.

9269,THE CRICKET'S STORY,"Ah, what shall my lord of the manor do?"
9270,THE CRICKET'S STORY,He pondered the day and the whole night through.

11044,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"With that bespake their mother dear,"

11052,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"God will your deeds regard."""
11053,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"With lips as cold as any stone,"
11054,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,They kissed their children small:
11055,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"""God bless you both, my children dear;"""
11056,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,With that the tears did fall.

11069,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And brings them straight into his house,"
11070,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Where much of them he makes.
11071,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,He had not kept these pretty babes
11072,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"A twelvemonth and a day,"
11073,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"But, for their wealth, he did devise"
11074,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,To make them both away.
11075,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11076,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"He bargained with two ruffians strong,"
11077,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Which were of furious mood,"
11078,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"That they should take these children young,"
11079,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And slay them in a wood.
11080,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"He told his wife an artful tale,"
11081,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,He would the children send
11082,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"To be brought up in fair London,"
11083,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,With one that was his friend.
11084,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11085,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Away then went these pretty babes,"
11086,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Rejoicing at that tide,"
11087,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Rejoicing with a merry mind,"
11088,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,They should on cock-horse ride.
11089,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"They prate and prattle pleasantly,"
11090,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"As they rode on the way,"
11091,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"To those that should their butchers be,"
11092,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And work their lives' decay:
11093,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11094,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"So that the pretty speech they had,"
11095,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Made Murder's heart relent;
11096,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And they that undertook the deed,"
11097,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Full sore did now repent.
11098,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Yet one of them more hard of heart,"
11099,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Did vow to do his charge,"
11100,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Because the wretch that hired him,"
11101,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Had paid him very large.
11102,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11103,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"The other won't agree thereto,"
11104,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,So here they fall to strife;
11105,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"With one another they did fight,"
11106,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,About the children's life:
11107,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And he that was of mildest mood,"
11108,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Did slay the other there,"
11109,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Within an unfrequented wood;
11110,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,The babes did quake for fear!

11112,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"He took the children by the hand,"
11113,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Tears standing in their eye,"
11114,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And bade them straightway follow him,"
11115,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And look they did not cry:
11116,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And two long miles he led them on,"
11117,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,While they for food complain:
11118,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"""Stay here,"" quoth he, ""I'll bring you bread,"

11120,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11121,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"These pretty babes, with hand in hand,"
11122,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Went wandering up and down,"
11123,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,But never more could see the man
11124,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Approaching from the town;
11125,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Their pretty lips with black-berries
11126,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Were all besmeared and dyed,"
11127,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And, when they saw the darksome night,"
11128,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,They sat them down and cried.
11129,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11130,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Thus wandered these poor innocents,"
11131,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Till death did end their grief;
11132,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"In one another's arms they died,"
11133,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,As wanting due relief:
11134,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,No burial this pretty pair
11135,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Of any man receives,"
11136,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Till Robin-red-breast piously
11137,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Did cover them with leaves.
11138,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11139,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And now the heavy wrath of God
11140,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Upon their uncle fell;
11141,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Yea, fearful fiends did haunt his house,"
11142,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,His conscience felt an hell:
11143,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"His barns were fired, his goods consumed,"
11144,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"His lands were barren made,"
11145,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"His cattle died within the field,"
11146,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And nothing with him stayed.
11147,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,
11148,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And in a voyage to Portugal
11149,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Two of his sons did die;
11150,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"And, to conclude, himself was brought"
11151,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,To want and misery:
11152,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,He pawned and mortgaged all his land
11153,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Ere seven years came about,"
11154,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,And now at length his wicked act
11155,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Did by this means come out:

11157,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"The fellow, that did take in hand"
11158,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"These children for to kill,"
11159,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Was for a robbery judged to die,"
11160,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Such was God's blessed will:
11161,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Who did confess the very truth
11162,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,As here hath been displayed:
11163,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,"Their uncle having died in jail,"
11164,THE BABES IN THE WOOD,Where he for debt was laid.

11182,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"The summer and autumn had been so wet,"
11183,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,That in winter the corn was growing yet:
11184,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"'Twas a piteous sight to see, all around,"
11185,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,The grain lie rotting on the ground.
11186,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11187,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,Every day the starving poor
11188,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door;
11189,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"For he had a plentiful last-year's store,"
11190,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,And all the neighborhood could tell
11191,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,His granaries were furnished well.
11192,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11193,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day
11194,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,To quiet the poor without delay;
11195,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"He bade them to his great barn repair,"
11196,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,And they should have food for the winter there.
11197,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11198,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,"
11199,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,The poor folk flocked from far and near;
11200,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,The great barn was full as it could hold
11201,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"Of women and children, and young and old."
11202,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11203,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"Then, when he saw it could hold no more,"
11204,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;
11205,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And, while for mercy on Christ they call,"
11206,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"He set fire to the barn, and burnt them all."
11207,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11208,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"""I' faith, 'tis an excellent bonfire!"" quoth he;"

11212,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11213,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"So then to his palace returned he,"
11214,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And he sat down to supper merrily,"
11215,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,And he slept that night like an innocent man;
11216,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,But Bishop Hatto never slept again.
11217,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11218,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"In the morning, as he entered the hall,"
11219,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"Where his picture hung against the wall,"
11220,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"A sweat like death all over him came,"
11221,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,For the rats had eaten it out of the frame.
11222,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11223,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"As he looked, there came a man from his farm,--"
11224,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,He had a countenance white with alarm:
11225,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"""My Lord, I opened your granaries this morn,"

11236,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"The walls are high, and the shores are steep,"
11237,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And the tide is strong, and the water deep."""
11238,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11239,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"Bishop Hatto fearfully hastened away,"
11240,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And he crossed the Rhine without delay,"
11241,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And reached his tower, and barred with care"

11243,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11244,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"He laid him down and closed his eyes,"
11245,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,But soon a scream made him arise;
11246,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"He started, and saw two eyes of flame"
11247,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"On his pillow, from whence the screaming came."
11248,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11249,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"He listened and looked,--it was only the cat;"
11250,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"But the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,"
11251,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"For she sat screaming, mad with fear,"
11252,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,At the army of rats that were drawing near.
11253,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11254,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"For they have swum over the river so deep,"
11255,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And they have climbed the shores so steep,"
11256,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,And now by thousands up they crawl
11257,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,To the holes and the windows in the wall.
11258,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11259,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"Down on his knees the Bishop fell,"
11260,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And faster and faster his beads did he tell,"
11261,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"As louder and louder, drawing near,"
11262,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,The saw of their teeth without he could hear.
11263,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11264,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And in at the windows, and in at the door,"
11265,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,And through the walls by thousands they pour;
11266,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"And down from the ceiling and up through the floor,"
11267,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"From the right and the left, from behind and before,"
11268,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"From within and without, from above and below,--"

11270,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,
11271,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"They have whetted their teeth against the stones,"
11272,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,And now they pick the Bishop's bones;
11273,GOD'S JUDGMENT ON A WICKED BISHOP,"They gnawed the flesh from every limb,"

11291,I,"Almost five hundred years ago,"
11292,I,To see the townsfolk suffer so
11293,I,From vermin was a pity.
11294,I,
11295,II,II
11296,II,Rats!
11297,II,"They fought the dogs and killed the cats,"
11298,II,"And bit the babies in the cradles,"

11300,II,"And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles,"
11301,II,"Split open the kegs of salted sprats,"
11302,II,"Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,"

11306,II,In fifty different sharps and flats.
11307,II,
11308,III,III
11309,III,At last the people in a body
11310,III,To the Town Hall came flocking:
11311,III,"""'Tis clear,"" cried they, ""our Mayor's a noddy;"
11312,III,"And as for our Corporation,--shocking"

11315,III,What's best to rid us of our vermin!
11316,III,"You hope, because you're old and obese,"
11317,III,To find in the furry civic robe ease?
11318,III,"Rouse up, sirs! Give your brains a racking,"
11319,III,"To find the remedy we're lacking,"
11320,III,"Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"""
11321,III,At this the Mayor and Corporation
11322,III,Quaked with a mighty consternation.

11324,IV,IV
11325,IV,"An hour they sat in council,--"
11326,IV,At length the Mayor broke silence:

11333,IV,"Just as he said this, what should hap"
11334,IV,At the chamber-door but a gentle tap?

11349,V,His queer long coat from heel to head
11350,V,"Was half of yellow and half of red,"
11351,V,"And he himself was tall and thin,"
11352,V,"With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,"
11353,V,"And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,"
11354,V,"No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,"

11369,VI,After me so as you never saw!

11372,VI,The mole and toad and newt and viper;
11373,VI,"And people call me the Pied Piper."""
11374,VI,(And here they noticed round his neck
11375,VI,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"

11378,VI,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying"
11379,VI,As if impatient to be playing

11394,VII,"Into the street the Piper stepped,"
11395,VII,"Smiling first a little smile,"
11396,VII,As if he knew what magic slept
11397,VII,In his quiet pipe the while;
11398,VII,"Then, like a musical adept,"
11399,VII,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
11400,VII,"And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,"
11401,VII,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
11402,VII,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,"
11403,VII,You heard as if an army muttered;
11404,VII,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
11405,VII,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
11406,VII,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.
11407,VII,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"
11408,VII,"Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,"
11409,VII,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
11410,VII,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
11411,VII,Cocking tails and pricking whiskers;
11412,VII,"Families by tens and dozens,"
11413,VII,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives,--"
11414,VII,Followed the Piper for their lives.
11415,VII,"From street to street he piped advancing,"
11416,VII,"And step for step they followed dancing,"
11417,VII,"Until they came to the river Weser,"
11418,VII,Wherein all plunged and perished!
11419,VII,"--Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar,"
11420,VII,Swam across and lived to carry
11421,VII,"(As he, the manuscript he cherished)"
11422,VII,"To Rat-land home his commentary,"
11423,VII,"Which was: ""At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
11424,VII,"I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,"
11425,VII,"And putting apples, wondrous ripe,"
11426,VII,"Into a cider-press's gripe,--"
11427,VII,"And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,"
11428,VII,"And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,"
11429,VII,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,"
11430,VII,And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks;
11431,VII,And it seemed as if a voice
11432,VII,(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
11433,VII,"Is breathed) called out, 'Oh rats, rejoice!"
11434,VII,The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!
11435,VII,"So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,"
11436,VII,"Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!'"
11437,VII,"And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon,"
11438,VII,"Already staved, like a great sun shone"
11439,VII,"Glorious scarce an inch before me,"
11440,VII,"Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!'--"

11458,IX,"With Claret, Moselle, Via-de-Grave, Hock;"
11459,IX,And half the money would replenish
11460,IX,Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.

11468,IX,"From the duty of giving you something to drink,"
11469,IX,And a matter of money to put in your poke;
11470,IX,"But as for the guilders, what we spoke"
11471,IX,"Of them, as you very well know, was in joke."

11498,XII,And to his lips again
11499,XII,Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
11500,XII,And ere he blew three notes (such sweet
11501,XII,Soft notes as yet musician's cunning
11502,XII,Never gave the enraptured air)
11503,XII,There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling
11504,XII,Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;
11505,XII,"Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,"
11506,XII,"Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering;"
11507,XII,"And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,"
11508,XII,Out came the children running:
11509,XII,"All the little boys and girls,"
11510,XII,"With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,"
11511,XII,"And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,"
11512,XII,"Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after"
11513,XII,The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
11514,XII,
11515,XIII,XIII
11516,XIII,"The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood"
11517,XIII,"As if they were changed into blocks of wood,"
11518,XIII,"Unable to move a step, or cry"
11519,XIII,"To the children merrily skipping by,--"
11520,XIII,And could only follow with the eye
11521,XIII,That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.
11522,XIII,"But how the Mayor was on the rack,"
11523,XIII,"And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,"
11524,XIII,As the Piper turned from the High Street
11525,XIII,To where the Weser rolled its waters
11526,XIII,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!
11527,XIII,"However, he turned from south to west,"
11528,XIII,"And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,"
11529,XIII,And after him the children pressed;
11530,XIII,Great was the joy in every breast.
11531,XIII,"""He never can cross that mighty top!"
11532,XIII,"He's forced to let the piping drop,"
11533,XIII,"And we shall see our children stop!"""
11534,XIII,"When, lo, as they reached the mountain-side,"
11535,XIII,"A wondrous portal opened wide,"
11536,XIII,As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
11537,XIII,And the Piper advanced and the children followed;
11538,XIII,"And when all were in, to the very last,"
11539,XIII,The door in the mountain-side shut fast.
11540,XIII,"Did I say, all?  No!  One was lame,"
11541,XIII,And could not dance the whole of the way;
11542,XIII,"And in after years, if you would blame"
11543,XIII,"His sadness, he was used to say,--"
11544,XIII,"""It's dull in our town since my playmates left!"
11545,XIII,I can't forget that I'm bereft
11546,XIII,"Of all the pleasant sights they see,"
11547,XIII,Which the Piper also promised me;
11548,XIII,"For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,"
11549,XIII,"Joining the town and just at hand,"
11550,XIII,"Where waters gushed, and fruit-trees grew,"
11551,XIII,"And flowers put forth a fairer hue,"
11552,XIII,And everything was strange and new;
11553,XIII,"The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,"
11554,XIII,"And their dogs outran our fallow deer,"
11555,XIII,"And honey-bees had lost their stings,"
11556,XIII,And horses were born with eagles' wings;
11557,XIII,And just as I became assured
11558,XIII,"My lame foot would be speedily cured,"
11559,XIII,"The music stopped and I stood still,"
11560,XIII,"And found myself outside the hill,"
11561,XIII,"Left alone against my will,"
11562,XIII,"To go now limping as before,"
11563,XIII,And never hear of that country more!
11564,XIII,
11565,XIV,XIV
11566,XIV,"Alas, alas for Hamelin!"
11567,XIV,There came into many a burgher's pate
11568,XIV,A text which says that heaven's gate
11569,XIV,Opes to the rich at as easy rate
11570,XIV,As the needle's eye takes a camel in!
11571,XIV,"The Mayor sent East, West, North and South,"
11572,XIV,"To offer the Piper, by word of mouth,"
11573,XIV,"Wherever it was men's lot to find him,"
11574,XIV,"Silver and gold to his heart's content,"
11575,XIV,"If he'd only return the way he went,"
11576,XIV,And bring the children behind him.
11577,XIV,"But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,"
11578,XIV,"And piper and dancers were gone forever,"
11579,XIV,They made a decree that lawyers never
11580,XIV,Should think their records dated duly
11581,XIV,"If, after the day of the month and year,"
11582,XIV,"These words did not as well appear,"
11583,XIV,"""And so long after what happened here"
11584,XIV,"On the Twenty-second of July,"
11585,XIV,"Thirteen hundred and seventy-six:"""
11586,XIV,And the better in memory to fix
11587,XIV,"The place of the children's last retreat,"
11588,XIV,"They called it, the Pied Piper's Street--"
11589,XIV,Where any one playing on pipe or tabor
11590,XIV,Was sure for the future to lose his labor.
11591,XIV,Nor suffered they hostlery or tavern
11592,XIV,To shock with mirth a street so solemn;
11593,XIV,But opposite the place of the cavern
11594,XIV,"They wrote the story on a column,"
11595,XIV,And on the great church-window painted
11596,XIV,"The same, to make the world acquainted"
11597,XIV,"How their children were stolen away,"
11598,XIV,And there it stands to this very day.
11599,XIV,And I must not omit to say
11600,XIV,That in Transylvania there's a tribe
11601,XIV,Of alien people who ascribe
11602,XIV,The outlandish ways and dress

11604,XIV,To their fathers and mothers having risen
11605,XIV,Out of some subterraneous prison
11606,XIV,Into which they were trepanned
11607,XIV,Long time ago in a mighty band
11608,XIV,"Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,"

12178,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Out of an inn to roam;
12179,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,In the place where she was homeless
12180,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,All men are at home.
12181,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"The crazy stable close at hand,"
12182,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"With shaking timber and shifting sand,"
12183,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Grew a stronger thing to abide and stand
12184,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Than the square stones of Rome.
12185,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,
12186,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"For men are homesick in their homes,"
12187,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"And strangers under the sun,"
12188,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,And they lay their heads in a foreign land
12189,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Whenever the day is done.
12190,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"Here we have battle and blazing eyes,"
12191,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"And chance and honor and high surprise,"
12192,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,But our homes are under miraculous skies
12193,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Where the yule tale was begun.
12194,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,
12195,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"A Child in a foul stable,"
12196,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"Where the beasts feed and foam,"
12197,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Only where He was homeless
12198,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Are you and I at home;
12199,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"We have hands that fashion and heads that know,"
12200,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,But our hearts we lost--how long ago!
12201,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,In a place no chart nor ship can show
12202,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Under the sky's dome.
12203,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,
12204,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"This world is wild as an old wives' tale,"
12205,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"And strange the plain things are,"
12206,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,The earth is enough and the air is enough
12207,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,For our wonder and our war;
12208,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,But our rest is as far as the fire-drake swings
12209,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,And our peace is put in impossible things
12210,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Where clashed and thundered unthinkable wings
12211,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,Round an incredible star.
12212,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,
12213,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,To an open house in the evening
12214,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"Home shall men come,"
12215,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,To an older place than Eden
12216,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,And a taller town than Rome.
12217,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"To the end of the way of the wandering star,"
12218,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,"To the things that cannot be and that are,"
12219,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,To the place where God was homeless
12220,THE HOUSE OF CHRISTMAS,And all men are at home.

12243,THE FEAST OF THE SNOW,
12244,THE FEAST OF THE SNOW,"The gods lie dead where the leaves lie red,"

12348,THE THREE KINGS,"Three Wise Men out of the East were they,"
12349,THE THREE KINGS,"And they travelled by night and they slept by day,"
12350,THE THREE KINGS,"For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star."
12351,THE THREE KINGS,
12352,THE THREE KINGS,"The star was so beautiful, large and clear,"
12353,THE THREE KINGS,That all the other stars of the sky
12354,THE THREE KINGS,Became a white mist in the atmosphere;
12355,THE THREE KINGS,And by this they knew that the coming was near
12356,THE THREE KINGS,Of the Prince foretold in the prophecy.
12357,THE THREE KINGS,
12358,THE THREE KINGS,"Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows,"
12359,THE THREE KINGS,Three caskets of gold with golden keys;
12360,THE THREE KINGS,"Their robes were of crimson silk, with rows"

12362,THE THREE KINGS,Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees.
12363,THE THREE KINGS,
12364,THE THREE KINGS,"And so the Three Kings rode into the West,"
12365,THE THREE KINGS,"Through the dusk of night, over hill and dell,"
12366,THE THREE KINGS,"And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast,"
12367,THE THREE KINGS,"And sometimes talked, as they paused to rest,"
12368,THE THREE KINGS,With the people they met at some wayside well.
12369,THE THREE KINGS,
12370,THE THREE KINGS,"""Of the child that is born,"" said Baltasar,"
12371,THE THREE KINGS,"""Good people, I pray you, tell us the news,"
12372,THE THREE KINGS,"For we in the East have seen his star,"

12375,THE THREE KINGS,
12376,THE THREE KINGS,"And the people answered, ""You ask in vain;"
12377,THE THREE KINGS,"We know of no king but Herod the Great!"""
12378,THE THREE KINGS,"They thought the Wise Men were men insane,"
12379,THE THREE KINGS,As they spurred their horses across the plain
12380,THE THREE KINGS,"Like riders in haste, and who cannot wait."
12381,THE THREE KINGS,
12382,THE THREE KINGS,"And when they came to Jerusalem,"
12383,THE THREE KINGS,"Herod the Great, who had heard this thing,"
12384,THE THREE KINGS,Sent for the Wise Men and questioned them;
12385,THE THREE KINGS,"And said, ""Go down unto Bethlehem,"

12387,THE THREE KINGS,
12388,THE THREE KINGS,"So they rode away, and the star stood still,"
12389,THE THREE KINGS,The only one in the gray of morn;
12390,THE THREE KINGS,"Yes, it stopped,--it stood still of its own free will,"
12391,THE THREE KINGS,"Right over Bethlehem on the hill,"
12392,THE THREE KINGS,"The city of David, where Christ was born."
12393,THE THREE KINGS,
12394,THE THREE KINGS,"And the Three Kings rode through the gate and the guard,"
12395,THE THREE KINGS,"Through the silent street, till their horses turned"
12396,THE THREE KINGS,And neighed as they entered the great inn-yard;
12397,THE THREE KINGS,"But the windows were closed, and the doors were barred,"
12398,THE THREE KINGS,And only a light in the stable burned.
12399,THE THREE KINGS,
12400,THE THREE KINGS,"And cradled there in the scented hay,"
12401,THE THREE KINGS,"In the air made sweet by the breath of kine,"
12402,THE THREE KINGS,"The little child in the manger lay,"
12403,THE THREE KINGS,The Child that would be King one day
12404,THE THREE KINGS,"Of a kingdom not human, but divine."
12405,THE THREE KINGS,
12406,THE THREE KINGS,"His mother, Mary of Nazareth,"
12407,THE THREE KINGS,"Sat watching beside his place of rest,"
12408,THE THREE KINGS,"Watching the even flow of his breath,"
12409,THE THREE KINGS,For the joy of life and the terror of death
12410,THE THREE KINGS,Were mingled together in her breast.
12411,THE THREE KINGS,
12412,THE THREE KINGS,They laid their offerings at his feet:
12413,THE THREE KINGS,The gold was their tribute to a King;
12414,THE THREE KINGS,"The frankincense, with its odor sweet,"
12415,THE THREE KINGS,"Was for the Priest, the Paraclete;"
12416,THE THREE KINGS,The myrrh for the body's burying.
12417,THE THREE KINGS,
12418,THE THREE KINGS,"And the mother wondered and bowed her head,"
12419,THE THREE KINGS,And sat as still as a statue of stone;
12420,THE THREE KINGS,"Her heart was troubled yet comforted,"
12421,THE THREE KINGS,Remembering what the Angel had said
12422,THE THREE KINGS,Of an endless reign and of David's throne.
12423,THE THREE KINGS,
12424,THE THREE KINGS,"Then the Kings rode out of the city gate,"
12425,THE THREE KINGS,With a clatter of hoofs in proud array;
12426,THE THREE KINGS,"But they went not back to Herod the Great,"
12427,THE THREE KINGS,"For they knew his malice and feared his hate,"
12428,THE THREE KINGS,And returned to their homes by another way.

12557,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,
12558,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house"
12559,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;"
12560,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,"
12561,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
12562,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"The children were nestled all snug in their beds,"
12563,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;
12564,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,"
12565,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,"
12566,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,"
12567,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
12568,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Away to the window I flew like a flash,"
12569,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
12570,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow
12571,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,"
12572,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,"
12573,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,"
12574,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"With a little old driver, so lively and quick,"
12575,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
12576,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,"
12577,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;"
12578,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"""Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!"
12579,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!"
12580,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
12581,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"""
12582,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,"
12583,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,"
12584,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,"
12585,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too."
12586,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof"
12587,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.
12588,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"As I drew in my head, and was turning around,"
12589,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
12590,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,"
12591,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
12592,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,"
12593,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
12594,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,His eyes--how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!
12595,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!"
12596,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,"
12597,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
12598,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,"
12599,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
12600,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He had a broad face and a little round belly,"
12601,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"That shook, when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly."
12602,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,"
12603,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;"
12604,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,"
12605,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
12606,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,"
12607,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,"
12608,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And laying his finger aside of his nose,"
12609,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;"
12610,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,"
12611,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.
12612,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,"
12613,A VTSTT FROM ST. NICHOLAS,"""Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."""

12682,THE HYMN,THE HYMN
12683,THE HYMN,It was the winter wild
12684,THE HYMN,While the heaven-born Child
12685,THE HYMN,All meanly wrapped in the rude manger lies;
12686,THE HYMN,Nature in awe to Him
12687,THE HYMN,"Had doffed her gaudy trim,"
12688,THE HYMN,With her great Master so to sympathize:
12689,THE HYMN,It was no season then for her
12690,THE HYMN,"To wanton with the sun, her lusty paramour."
12691,THE HYMN,
12692,THE HYMN,Only with speeches fair
12693,THE HYMN,She woos the gentle air
12694,THE HYMN,To hide her guilty front with innocent snow;
12695,THE HYMN,"And on her naked shame,"
12696,THE HYMN,"Pollute with sinful blame,"
12697,THE HYMN,The saintly veil of maiden white to throw;
12698,THE HYMN,"Confounded, that her Maker's eyes"
12699,THE HYMN,Should look so near upon her foul deformities.
12700,THE HYMN,
12701,THE HYMN,"But he, her fears to cease,"
12702,THE HYMN,Sent down the meek-eyed Peace;
12703,THE HYMN,"She, crowned with olive green, came softly sliding"
12704,THE HYMN,"Down through the turning sphere,"
12705,THE HYMN,"His ready harbinger,"
12706,THE HYMN,With turtle wing and amorous clouds dividing;
12707,THE HYMN,"And waving wide her myrtle wand,"
12708,THE HYMN,She strikes a universal peace through sea and land.
12709,THE HYMN,
12710,THE HYMN,"No war, or battle's sound"
12711,THE HYMN,Was heard the world around:
12712,THE HYMN,The idle spear and shield were high uphung;
12713,THE HYMN,The hooked chariot stood
12714,THE HYMN,Unstained with hostile blood;
12715,THE HYMN,The trumpet spake not to the armed throng;
12716,THE HYMN,"And kings sat still with awful eye,"
12717,THE HYMN,As if they surely knew their sovereign Lord was by.
12718,THE HYMN,
12719,THE HYMN,But peaceful was the night
12720,THE HYMN,Wherein the Prince of Light
12721,THE HYMN,His reign of peace upon the earth began:
12722,THE HYMN,"The winds, with wonder whist,"
12723,THE HYMN,"Smoothly the waters kissed,"
12724,THE HYMN,Whispering new joys to the mild ocean--
12725,THE HYMN,"Who now hath quite forgot to rave,"
12726,THE HYMN,While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave.
12727,THE HYMN,
12728,THE HYMN,"The stars, with deep amaze,"
12729,THE HYMN,"Stand fixed in steadfast gaze,"
12730,THE HYMN,Bending one way their precious influence;
12731,THE HYMN,And will not take their flight
12732,THE HYMN,"For all the morning light,"
12733,THE HYMN,Or Lucifer that often warned them thence;
12734,THE HYMN,But in their glimmering orbs did glow
12735,THE HYMN,"Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go."
12736,THE HYMN,
12737,THE HYMN,And though the shady gloom
12738,THE HYMN,"Had given day her room,"
12739,THE HYMN,"The sun himself withheld his wonted speed,"
12740,THE HYMN,"And hid his head for shame,"
12741,THE HYMN,As his inferior flame
12742,THE HYMN,The new-enlightened world no more should need;
12743,THE HYMN,He saw a greater Sun appear
12744,THE HYMN,"Than his bright throne, or burning axletree, could bear."
12745,THE HYMN,
12746,THE HYMN,The shepherds on the lawn
12747,THE HYMN,Or ere the point of dawn
12748,THE HYMN,Sat simply chatting in a rustic row;
12749,THE HYMN,Full little thought they then
12750,THE HYMN,That the mighty Pan
12751,THE HYMN,Was kindly come to live with them below;
12752,THE HYMN,"Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep,"
12753,THE HYMN,Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep.
12754,THE HYMN,
12755,THE HYMN,When such music sweet
12756,THE HYMN,Their hearts and ears did greet
12757,THE HYMN,As never was by mortal finger strook--
12758,THE HYMN,Divinely-warbled voice
12759,THE HYMN,"Answering the stringed noise,"
12760,THE HYMN,As all their souls in blissful rapture took:
12761,THE HYMN,"The air, such pleasure loth to lose,"
12762,THE HYMN,With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close.
12763,THE HYMN,
12764,THE HYMN,"Nature, that heard such sound"
12765,THE HYMN,Beneath the hollow round
12766,THE HYMN,"Of Cynthia's seat the airy region thrilling,"
12767,THE HYMN,Now was almost won
12768,THE HYMN,"To think her part was done,"
12769,THE HYMN,And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;
12770,THE HYMN,She knew such harmony alone
12771,THE HYMN,Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union.
12772,THE HYMN,
12773,THE HYMN,At last surrounds their sight
12774,THE HYMN,A globe of circular light
12775,THE HYMN,That with long beams the shamefaced night arrayed;
12776,THE HYMN,The helmed Cherubim
12777,THE HYMN,And sworded Seraphim
12778,THE HYMN,"Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed,"
12779,THE HYMN,Harping in loud and solemn choir
12780,THE HYMN,"With unexpressive notes, to Heaven's new-born Heir."
12781,THE HYMN,
12782,THE HYMN,Such music (as 'tis said)
12783,THE HYMN,Before was never made
12784,THE HYMN,"But when of old the sons of morning sung,"
12785,THE HYMN,While the Creator great
12786,THE HYMN,His constellations set
12787,THE HYMN,And the well-balanced world on hinges hung;
12788,THE HYMN,"And cast the dark foundations deep,"
12789,THE HYMN,And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep.
12790,THE HYMN,
12791,THE HYMN,"Ring out, ye crystal spheres!"
12792,THE HYMN,"Once bless our human ears,"
12793,THE HYMN,If ye have power to touch our senses so;
12794,THE HYMN,And let your silver chime
12795,THE HYMN,Move in melodious time;
12796,THE HYMN,And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;
12797,THE HYMN,And with your ninefold harmony
12798,THE HYMN,Make up full consort to the angelic symphony.
12799,THE HYMN,
12800,THE HYMN,For if such holy song
12801,THE HYMN,"Enwrap our fancy long,"
12802,THE HYMN,"Time will run back, and fetch the age of gold;"
12803,THE HYMN,And speckled vanity
12804,THE HYMN,"Will sicken soon and die,"
12805,THE HYMN,And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould;
12806,THE HYMN,"And Hell itself will pass away,"
12807,THE HYMN,And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day.
12808,THE HYMN,
12809,THE HYMN,"Yea, Truth and Justice then"
12810,THE HYMN,"Will down return to men,"
12811,THE HYMN,"Orbed in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing,"
12812,THE HYMN,Mercy will sit between
12813,THE HYMN,"Throned in celestial sheen,"
12814,THE HYMN,With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering;
12815,THE HYMN,"And Heaven, as at some festival,"
12816,THE HYMN,Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.
12817,THE HYMN,
12818,THE HYMN,But wisest Fate says No;
12819,THE HYMN,This must not yet be so;
12820,THE HYMN,The Babe yet lies in smiling infancy
12821,THE HYMN,That on the bitter cross
12822,THE HYMN,Must redeem our loss;
12823,THE HYMN,So both himself and us to glorify:
12824,THE HYMN,"Yet first, to those ychained in sleep"
12825,THE HYMN,The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep;
12826,THE HYMN,
12827,THE HYMN,With such a horrid clang
12828,THE HYMN,As on Mount Sinai rang
12829,THE HYMN,While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake:
12830,THE HYMN,The aged Earth aghast
12831,THE HYMN,With terror of that blast
12832,THE HYMN,"Shall from the surface to the centre shake,"
12833,THE HYMN,"When, at the world's last session,"
12834,THE HYMN,The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread His throne.
12835,THE HYMN,
12836,THE HYMN,And then at last our bliss
12837,THE HYMN,"Full and perfect is,"
12838,THE HYMN,But now begins; for from this happy day
12839,THE HYMN,"The old Dragon under ground,"
12840,THE HYMN,"In straiter limits bound,"
12841,THE HYMN,Not half so far casts his usurped sway;
12842,THE HYMN,"And, wroth to see his kingdom fail,"
12843,THE HYMN,Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail.
12844,THE HYMN,
12845,THE HYMN,The oracles are dumb;
12846,THE HYMN,No voice or hideous hum
12847,THE HYMN,Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving.
12848,THE HYMN,Apollo from his shrine
12849,THE HYMN,"Can no more divine,"
12850,THE HYMN,With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving:
12851,THE HYMN,No nightly trance or breathed spell
12852,THE HYMN,Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell.
12853,THE HYMN,
12854,THE HYMN,The lonely mountains o'er
12855,THE HYMN,And the resounding shore
12856,THE HYMN,"A voice of weeping heard, and loud lament;"
12857,THE HYMN,From haunted spring and dale
12858,THE HYMN,Edged with poplar pale
12859,THE HYMN,The parting Genius is with sighing sent;
12860,THE HYMN,With flower-inwoven tresses torn
12861,THE HYMN,The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn.
12862,THE HYMN,
12863,THE HYMN,In consecrated earth
12864,THE HYMN,And on the holy hearth
12865,THE HYMN,The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint;
12866,THE HYMN,"In urns, and altars round"
12867,THE HYMN,A drear and dying sound
12868,THE HYMN,Affrights the Flamens at their service quaint;
12869,THE HYMN,"And the chill marble seems to sweat,"
12870,THE HYMN,While each peculiar Power foregoes his wonted seat.
12871,THE HYMN,
12872,THE HYMN,Peor and Baalim
12873,THE HYMN,"Forsake their temples dim,"
12874,THE HYMN,With that twice-battered god of Palestine;
12875,THE HYMN,And mooned Ashtaroth
12876,THE HYMN,"Heaven's queen and mother both,"
12877,THE HYMN,Now sits not girt with tapers' holy shine;
12878,THE HYMN,The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn:
12879,THE HYMN,In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn.
12880,THE HYMN,
12881,THE HYMN,"And sullen Moloch, fled,"
12882,THE HYMN,Hath left in shadows dread
12883,THE HYMN,His burning idol all of blackest hue;
12884,THE HYMN,In vain with cymbals' ring
12885,THE HYMN,"They call the grisly king,"
12886,THE HYMN,In dismal dance about the furnace blue;
12887,THE HYMN,"The brutish gods of Nile as fast,"
12888,THE HYMN,"Isis, and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste."
12889,THE HYMN,
12890,THE HYMN,Nor is Osiris seen
12891,THE HYMN,"In Memphian grove, or green,"
12892,THE HYMN,Trampling the unshowered grass with lowings loud:
12893,THE HYMN,Nor can he be at rest
12894,THE HYMN,Within his sacred chest;
12895,THE HYMN,Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud;
12896,THE HYMN,In vain with timbrelled anthems dark
12897,THE HYMN,The sable stoled sorcerers bear his worshiped ark.
12898,THE HYMN,
12899,THE HYMN,He feels from Juda's land
12900,THE HYMN,The dreaded Infant's hand;
12901,THE HYMN,The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyen;
12902,THE HYMN,Nor all the gods beside
12903,THE HYMN,Longer dare abide
12904,THE HYMN,Nor Typhon huge ending in snaky twine:

13344,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"And each put a horn into his mouth,"

13356,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,
13357,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"""And some they brought the brown linseed"

13380,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,There was no one left but me.
13381,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,
13382,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"""And all on the top of the Caldon-Low"
13383,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"The mists were cold and gray,"
13384,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,And nothing I saw but the mossy stones
13385,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,That round about me lay.
13386,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,
13387,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"""But, coming down from the hill-top,"

13391,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,
13392,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"""And I peeped into the widow's field,"
13393,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"And, sure enough, was seen"
13394,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,The yellow ears of the mildewed corn
13395,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,All standing stout and green.
13396,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,
13397,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"""And down the weaver's croft I stole,"
13398,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,To see if the flax were sprung;
13399,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,And I met the weaver at his gate
13400,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,With the good news on his tongue!
13401,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,
13402,THE FAIRIES OF THE CALDON-LOW,"""Now, this is all I heard, mother,"

13700,THE VISITOR,"Without his oaten warning,--"
13701,THE VISITOR,And found he'd gone away.
13702,THE VISITOR,
13703,THE VISITOR,He left no trace behind him;
13704,THE VISITOR,But still the milkmaids deem
13705,THE VISITOR,"That they, perhaps, may find him"
13706,THE VISITOR,With butter and with cream:
13707,THE VISITOR,Beside the door they set them
13708,THE VISITOR,"In bowl and golden pat,"
13709,THE VISITOR,But no one comes to get them--

15356,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,We looked into the pit prepared to take her:

15358,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"From the sleep wherein she lieth none will wake her,"
15359,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Crying, 'Get up, little Alice! it is day.'"

15362,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Could we see her face, be sure we should not know her,"

15391,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Through the coal-dark, underground;"
15392,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Or, all day, we drive the wheels of iron"

15400,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Turns the long light that drops adown the wall,"
15401,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Turn the black flies that crawl along the ceiling:
15402,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"All are turning, all the day, and we with all."
15403,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And all day, the iron wheels are droning;"
15404,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And sometimes we could pray,"

15406,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"'Stop! be silent for to-day!'"""
15407,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,
15408,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Ay, be silent!  Let them hear each other breathing"

15410,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Let them touch each other's hands, in a fresh wreathing"
15411,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Of their tender human youth!
15412,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Let them feel that this cold metallic motion
15413,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Is not all the life God fashions or reveals:
15414,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Let them prove their living souls against the notion
15415,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"That they live in you, or under you, O wheels!"
15416,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Still, all day, the iron wheels go onward,"
15417,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Grinding life down from its mark;
15418,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And the children's souls, which God is calling sunward,"
15419,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Spin on blindly in the dark.
15420,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,
15421,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Now tell the poor young children, O my brothers,"
15422,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,To look up to Him and pray;
15423,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"So the blessed One, who blesseth all the others,"
15424,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Will bless them another day.
15425,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"They answer, ""Who is God that He should hear us,"
15426,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,While the rushing of the iron wheels is stirred?
15427,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"When we sob aloud, the human creatures near us"
15428,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Pass by, hearing not, or answer not a word!"
15429,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,And we hear not (for the wheels in their resounding)
15430,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Strangers speaking at the door:
15431,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Is it likely God, with angels singing round Him,"
15432,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Hears our weeping any more?
15433,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,
15434,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"""Two words, indeed, of praying we remember,"
15435,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And at midnight's hour of harm,"
15436,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"'Our Father,' looking upward in the chamber,"
15437,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,We say softly for a charm.
15438,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"We know no other words except 'Our Father,'"
15439,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And we think that, in some pause of angels' song,"
15440,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"God may pluck them with the silence sweet to gather,"
15441,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,And hold both within his right hand which is strong.
15442,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"'Our Father!' If He heard us, He would surely"
15443,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,(For they call Him good and mild)
15444,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Answer, smiling down the steep world very purely,"
15445,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"'Come and rest with me, my child.'"
15446,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,
15447,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"""But no!"" say the children, weeping faster,"
15448,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"""He is speechless as a stone;"
15449,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And they tell us, of His image is the master"
15450,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Who commands us to work on.
15451,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Go to!"" say the children,--""Up in Heaven,"
15452,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Dark, wheel-like, turning clouds are all we find."
15453,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Do not mock us; grief has made us unbelieving:
15454,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"We look up for God, but tears have made us blind."""
15455,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Do you hear the children weeping and disproving,"
15456,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"O my brothers, what ye preach?"
15457,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"For God's possible is taught by His world's loving,"
15458,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,And the children doubt of each.
15459,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,
15460,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,And well may the children weep before you!
15461,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,They are weary ere they run;
15462,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"They have never seen the sunshine, nor the glory"
15463,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Which is brighter than the sun.
15464,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"They know the grief of man, without its wisdom;"
15465,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"They sink in man's despair, without its calm;"
15466,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Are slaves, without the liberty in Christdom,"
15467,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Are martyrs, by the pang without the palm:"
15468,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Are worn as if with age, yet unretrievingly"
15469,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"The harvest of its memories cannot reap,--"
15470,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Are orphans of the earthly love and heavenly.
15471,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,Let them weep! let them weep!
15472,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,
15473,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"They look up, with their pale and sunken faces,"
15474,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"And their look is dread to see,"
15475,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"For they mind you of their angels in high places,"
15476,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,With eyes turned on Deity.
15477,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"""How long,"" they say, ""how long, O cruel nation,"
15478,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Will you stand, to move the world, on a child's heart,--"
15479,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Stifle down with a mailed heel its palpitation,"
15480,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?
15481,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,"Our blood splashes upward, O gold-heaper,"
15482,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,And your purple shows your path;
15483,THE CRY OF THE CHILDREN,But the child's sob in the silence curses deeper

15594,LUCY GRAY,Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray:
15595,LUCY GRAY,"And, when I crossed the wild,"
15596,LUCY GRAY,"I chanced to see, at break of day,"
15597,LUCY GRAY,The solitary child.
15598,LUCY GRAY,
15599,LUCY GRAY,"No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;"
15600,LUCY GRAY,"She dwelt on a wide moor,"

15604,LUCY GRAY,"You yet may spy the fawn at play,"
15605,LUCY GRAY,The hare upon the green;
15606,LUCY GRAY,But the sweet face of Lucy Gray

15618,LUCY GRAY,
15619,LUCY GRAY,"At this the Father raised his hook,"
15620,LUCY GRAY,And snapped a fagot-brand.
15621,LUCY GRAY,He plied his work;--and Lucy took
15622,LUCY GRAY,The lantern in her hand.

15625,LUCY GRAY,With many a wanton stroke
15626,LUCY GRAY,"Her feet disperse the powdery snow,"
15627,LUCY GRAY,That rises up like smoke.
15628,LUCY GRAY,
15629,LUCY GRAY,The storm came on before its time:
15630,LUCY GRAY,She wandered up and down:
15631,LUCY GRAY,And many a hill did Lucy climb:
15632,LUCY GRAY,But never reached the town.
15633,LUCY GRAY,
15634,LUCY GRAY,The wretched parents all that night
15635,LUCY GRAY,Went shouting far and wide;
15636,LUCY GRAY,But there was neither sound nor sight
15637,LUCY GRAY,To serve them for a guide.
15638,LUCY GRAY,
15639,LUCY GRAY,At daybreak on the hill they stood
15640,LUCY GRAY,That overlooked the moor;
15641,LUCY GRAY,"And thence they saw the bridge of wood,"
15642,LUCY GRAY,A furlong from their door.
15643,LUCY GRAY,
15644,LUCY GRAY,"They wept,--and, turning homeward, cried,"
15645,LUCY GRAY,"""In heaven we all shall meet;"""
15646,LUCY GRAY,When in the snow the mother spied
15647,LUCY GRAY,The print of Lucy's feet.
15648,LUCY GRAY,
15649,LUCY GRAY,Then downwards from the steep hill's edge
15650,LUCY GRAY,They tracked the footmarks small:
15651,LUCY GRAY,"And through the broken hawthorn-hedge,"
15652,LUCY GRAY,And by the low stone-wall;
15653,LUCY GRAY,
15654,LUCY GRAY,And then an open field they crossed--
15655,LUCY GRAY,The marks were still the same--
15656,LUCY GRAY,"They tracked them on, nor ever lost;"
15657,LUCY GRAY,And to the bridge they came.
15658,LUCY GRAY,
15659,LUCY GRAY,They followed from the snowy bank
15660,LUCY GRAY,"Those footmarks, one by one,"
15661,LUCY GRAY,Into the middle of the plank;
15662,LUCY GRAY,And further there were none!
15663,LUCY GRAY,
15664,LUCY GRAY,--Yet some maintain that to this day
15665,LUCY GRAY,She is a living child;
15666,LUCY GRAY,That you may see sweet Lucy Gray
15667,LUCY GRAY,Upon the lonesome wild.
15668,LUCY GRAY,
15669,LUCY GRAY,"O'er rough and smooth she trips along,"
15670,LUCY GRAY,And never looks behind;
15671,LUCY GRAY,And sings a solitary song
15672,LUCY GRAY,That whistles in the wind.

15680,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Emmie
15681,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15682,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Our doctor had called in another, I never had seen him before,"
15683,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"But he sent a chill to my heart when I saw him come in at the door,"
15684,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Fresh from the surgery-schools of France and of other lands--
15685,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Harsh red hair, big voice, big chest, big merciless hands!"
15686,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Wonderful cures he had done, O yes, but they said too of him"
15687,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"He was happier using the knife than in trying to save the limb,"
15688,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"And that I can well believe, for he looked so coarse and so red,"
15689,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"I could think he was one of those who would break their jests on the dead,"
15690,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,And mangle the living dog that had loved him and fawned  at his knee--
15691,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Drenched with the hellish oorali--that ever such things should be!
15692,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15693,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Here was a boy--I am sure that some of our children would die
15694,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"But for the voice of love, and the smile, and the comforting eye--"
15695,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Here was a boy in the ward, every bone seemed out of its place--"
15696,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Caught in a mill and crushed--it was all but a hopeless case:
15697,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"And he handled him gently enough; but his voice and his face were not kind,"
15698,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"And it was but a hopeless case, he had seen it and made up his mind,"
15699,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"And he said to me roughly ""The lad will need little more of your care."""
15700,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"""All the more need,"" I told him, ""to seek the Lord Jesus in prayer;"
15701,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"They are all His children here, and I pray for them all as my own:"""
15702,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"But he turned to me, ""Ay, good woman, can prayer set a broken bone?"""
15703,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Then he muttered half to himself, but I know that I heard him say,"
15704,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"""All very well--but the good Lord Jesus has had his day."""
15705,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15706,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Had? has it come?  It has only dawned.  It will come by and by.
15707,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"O, how could I serve in the wards if the hope of the world were a lie?"
15708,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,How could I bear with the sights and the loathsome smells of disease
15709,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"But that He said ""Ye do it to me, when ye do it to these""?"
15710,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15711,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,So he went.  And we passed to this ward where the younger children are laid:
15712,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Here is the cot of our orphan, our darling, our meek little maid;"
15713,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Empty you see just now!  We have lost her who loved her so much--
15714,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Patient of pain though as quick as a sensitive plant to the touch;
15715,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Hers was the prettiest prattle, it often moved me to tears,"
15716,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Hers was the gratefullest heart I have found in a child of her years--
15717,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Nay you remember our Emmie; you used to send her the flowers;
15718,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"How she would smile at 'em, play with 'em, talk to 'em hours after hours!"
15719,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15720,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,They that can wander at will where the works of the Lord are revealed
15721,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Little guess what joy can be got from a cowslip out of the field;
15722,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Flowers to these ""spirits in prison"" are all they can know of the spring,"
15723,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,They freshen and sweeten the wards like the waft of an angel's wing;
15724,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,And she lay with a flower in one hand and her thin hands crossed on
15725,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,her breast--
15726,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Wan, but as pretty as heart can desire, and we thought her at rest,"
15727,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Quietly sleeping--so quiet, our doctor said, ""Poor little dear,"
15728,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Nurse, I must do it to-morrow; she'll never live through it, I fear."""
15729,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15730,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"I walked with our kindly old doctor as far as the head of the stair,"
15731,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,Then I returned to the ward; the child didn't see I was there.
15732,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15733,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Never since I was nurse, had I been so grieved and so vexed!"
15734,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Emmie had heard him.  Softly she called from her cot to the next,"
15735,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"""He says I shall never live through it; O Annie, what shall I do?"""
15736,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Annie considered.  ""If I,"" said the wise little Annie, ""was you,"
15737,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"I should cry to the dear Lord Jesus to help me, for, Emmie, you see,"
15738,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"It's all in the picture there: 'Little children should come to Me.'""--"
15739,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"(Meaning the print that you gave us, I find that it always can please"
15740,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Our children, the dear Lord Jesus with children about His knees.)"
15741,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"""Yes, and I will,"" said Emmie, ""but then if I call to the Lord,"
15742,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"How should He know that it's me? such a lot of beds in the ward?"""
15743,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,That was a puzzle for Annie.  Again she considered and said:
15744,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"""Emmie, you put out your arms, and you leave 'em outside on the bed--"
15745,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"The Lord has so much to see to! but, Emmie, you tell it Him plain,"
15746,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"It's the little girl with her arms lying out on the counterpane."""
15747,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15748,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,I had sat three nights by the child--I could not watch her for four--
15749,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,My brain had begun to reel--I felt I could do it no more.
15750,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"That was my sleeping-night, but I thought that it never would pass."
15751,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"There was a thunderclap once, and a clatter of hail on the glass,"
15752,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"And there was a phantom cry that I heard as I tossed about,"
15753,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,The motherless bleat of a lamb in the storm and the darkness without;
15754,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,My sleep was broken besides with dreams of the dreadful knife
15755,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,And fears for our delicate Emmie who scarce would escape with her life;
15756,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Then in the gray of the morning it seemed she stood by me and smiled,"
15757,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"And the doctor came at his hour, and we went to see the child."
15758,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,
15759,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,He had brought his ghastly tools: we believed her asleep again--
15760,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Her dear, long, lean, little arms lying out on the counterpane;--"
15761,IN THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,"Say that His day is done! Ah, why should we care what they say?"

15907,THE DISCOVERER,"He is a brave discoverer,"
15908,THE DISCOVERER,"And, far beyond the tether"
15909,THE DISCOVERER,"Of them who seek the frozen Pole,"
15910,THE DISCOVERER,Has sailed where the noiseless surges roll.
15911,THE DISCOVERER,"Ay, he has travelled whither"
15912,THE DISCOVERER,A winged pilot steered his bark
15913,THE DISCOVERER,"Through the portals of the dark,"
15914,THE DISCOVERER,"Past hoary Mimir's well and tree,"
15915,THE DISCOVERER,Across the unknown sea.
15916,THE DISCOVERER,
15917,THE DISCOVERER,"Suddenly, in his fair young hour,"
15918,THE DISCOVERER,"Came one who bore a flower,"
15919,THE DISCOVERER,And laid it in his dimpled hand
15920,THE DISCOVERER,With this command:
15921,THE DISCOVERER,"""Henceforth thou art a rover!"
15922,THE DISCOVERER,"Thou must make a voyage far,"
15923,THE DISCOVERER,"Sail beneath the evening star,"
15924,THE DISCOVERER,"And a wondrous land discover."""
15925,THE DISCOVERER,--With his sweet smile innocent
15926,THE DISCOVERER,Our little kinsman went.
15927,THE DISCOVERER,
15928,THE DISCOVERER,Since that time no word
15929,THE DISCOVERER,From the absent has been heard.
15930,THE DISCOVERER,Who can tell
15931,THE DISCOVERER,"How he fares, or answer well"
15932,THE DISCOVERER,What the little one has found
15933,THE DISCOVERER,"Since he left us, outward bound?"
15934,THE DISCOVERER,Would that he might return!
15935,THE DISCOVERER,Then should we learn
15936,THE DISCOVERER,From the pricking of his chart
15937,THE DISCOVERER,How the skyey roadways part.
15938,THE DISCOVERER,"Hush! does not the baby this way bring,"
15939,THE DISCOVERER,"To lay beside this severed curl,"
15940,THE DISCOVERER,Some starry offering
15941,THE DISCOVERER,Of chrysolite or pearl?
15942,THE DISCOVERER,
15943,THE DISCOVERER,"Ah, no! not so!"
15944,THE DISCOVERER,"We may follow on his track,"
15945,THE DISCOVERER,But he comes not back.
15946,THE DISCOVERER,And yet I dare aver
15947,THE DISCOVERER,He is a brave discoverer
15948,THE DISCOVERER,Of climes his elders do not know.
15949,THE DISCOVERER,He has more learning than appears
15950,THE DISCOVERER,"On the scroll of twice three thousand years,"
15951,THE DISCOVERER,"More than in the groves is taught,"
15952,THE DISCOVERER,Or from furthest Indies brought;
15953,THE DISCOVERER,"He knows, perchance, how spirits fare,--"
15954,THE DISCOVERER,"What shapes the angels wear,"
15955,THE DISCOVERER,What is their guise and speech
15956,THE DISCOVERER,"In those lands beyond our reach,--"

15967,A CHRYSALIS,My little Madchen found one day
15968,A CHRYSALIS,"A curious something in her play,"
15969,A CHRYSALIS,"That was not fruit, nor flower, nor seed;"
15970,A CHRYSALIS,"It was not anything that grew,"
15971,A CHRYSALIS,"Or crept, or climbed, or swam, or flew;"
15972,A CHRYSALIS,"Had neither legs nor wings, indeed;"
15973,A CHRYSALIS,"And yet she was not sure, she said,"
15974,A CHRYSALIS,Whether it was alive or dead.
15975,A CHRYSALIS,
15976,A CHRYSALIS,She brought in her tiny hand
15977,A CHRYSALIS,"To see if I would understand,"
15978,A CHRYSALIS,"And wondered when I made reply,"
15979,A CHRYSALIS,"""You've found a baby butterfly."""
15980,A CHRYSALIS,"""A butterfly is not like this,"""
15981,A CHRYSALIS,With doubtful look she answered me.
15982,A CHRYSALIS,So then I told her what would be
15983,A CHRYSALIS,Some day within the chrysalis;
15984,A CHRYSALIS,"How, slowly, in the dull brown thing"
15985,A CHRYSALIS,"Now still as death, a spotted wing,"
15986,A CHRYSALIS,"And then another, would unfold,"
15987,A CHRYSALIS,Till from the empty shell would fly
15988,A CHRYSALIS,"A pretty creature, by and by,"
15989,A CHRYSALIS,All radiant in blue and gold.
15990,A CHRYSALIS,
15991,A CHRYSALIS,"""And will it, truly?"" questioned she--"
15992,A CHRYSALIS,Her laughing lips and eager eyes
15993,A CHRYSALIS,All in a sparkle of surprise--
15994,A CHRYSALIS,"""And shall your little Madchen see?"""
15995,A CHRYSALIS,"""She shall! I said.  How could I tell"
15996,A CHRYSALIS,That ere the worm within its shell
15997,A CHRYSALIS,"Its gauzy, splendid wings had spread,"
15998,A CHRYSALIS,My little Madchen would be dead?
15999,A CHRYSALIS,
16000,A CHRYSALIS,"To-day the butterfly has flown,--"
16001,A CHRYSALIS,"She was not here to see it fly,--"
16002,A CHRYSALIS,And sorrowing I wonder why
16003,A CHRYSALIS,The empty shell is mine alone.
16004,A CHRYSALIS,Perhaps the secret lies in this:
16005,A CHRYSALIS,"I too had found a chrysalis,"
16006,A CHRYSALIS,And Death that robbed me of delight
16007,A CHRYSALIS,Was but the radiant creature's flight!

17449,THE SOLITARY REAPER,No Nightingale did ever chaunt
17450,THE SOLITARY REAPER,More welcome notes to weary bands
17451,THE SOLITARY REAPER,"Of Travellers in some shady haunt,"

17453,THE SOLITARY REAPER,A voice so thrilling ne'er was heard
17454,THE SOLITARY REAPER,"In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,"
17455,THE SOLITARY REAPER,Breaking the silence of the seas
17456,THE SOLITARY REAPER,Among the farthest Hebrides.
17457,THE SOLITARY REAPER,

17459,THE SOLITARY REAPER,Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
17460,THE SOLITARY REAPER,"For old, unhappy, far-off things,"
17461,THE SOLITARY REAPER,And battles long ago:

17463,THE SOLITARY REAPER,Familiar matter of to-day?

17470,THE SOLITARY REAPER,And o'er the sickle bending;--
17471,THE SOLITARY REAPER,"I listened, motionless and still;"
17472,THE SOLITARY REAPER,"And, as I mounted up the hill,"
17473,THE SOLITARY REAPER,"The music in my heart I bore,"
17474,THE SOLITARY REAPER,Long after it was heard no more.

17520,III,--Say whence that modulated shout!
17521,III,From Wood-nymph of Diana's throng?
17522,III,Or does the greeting to a rout
17523,III,Of giddy Bacchanals belong?
17524,III,Jubilant outcry! rock and glade

17526,III,The breath of an Helvetian Maid.

17538,IV,And nobly wilt thou brook the chains
17539,IV,"That, for the virtuous, Life prepares;"

18794,MIDDLE AGE,With Fancy's sparkling wine;
18795,MIDDLE AGE,And all the things I willed then

18846,MIDDLE AGE,
18847,MIDDLE AGE,For youth it is the season
18848,MIDDLE AGE,Of restlessness and strife;
18849,MIDDLE AGE,"Of passion and unreason,"
18850,MIDDLE AGE,And ignorance of life.
18851,MIDDLE AGE,"Since, though his cheeks have roses,"
18852,MIDDLE AGE,No boy can understand
18853,MIDDLE AGE,That everything he knows is
18854,MIDDLE AGE,A graft at second hand.
18855,MIDDLE AGE,
18856,MIDDLE AGE,But we have toiled and wandered
18857,MIDDLE AGE,With weary feet and numb;
18858,MIDDLE AGE,"Have doubted, sifted, pondered,--"
18859,MIDDLE AGE,How else should knowledge come?
18860,MIDDLE AGE,"Have seen too late for heeding,"
18861,MIDDLE AGE,"Our hopes go out in tears,"
18862,MIDDLE AGE,"Lost in the dim receding,"
18863,MIDDLE AGE,Irrevocable years.
18864,MIDDLE AGE,
18865,MIDDLE AGE,"Yet, though with busy fingers"
18866,MIDDLE AGE,"No more we wreathe the flowers,"
18867,MIDDLE AGE,"An airy perfume lingers,"
18868,MIDDLE AGE,A brightness still is ours.
18869,MIDDLE AGE,"And though no rose our cheeks have,"
18870,MIDDLE AGE,The sky still shines as blue;

19110,I,"The earth, and every common sight,"
19111,I,To me did seem
19112,I,"Apparelled in celestial light,"
19113,I,The glory and the freshness of a dream.

19213,VII,"A wedding or a festival,"
19214,VII,A mourning or a funeral;

19260,IX,"Delight and liberty, the simple creed"

19269,IX,"Moving about in worlds not realized,"

19271,IX,Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
19272,IX,"But for those first affections,"
19273,IX,"Those shadowy recollections,"
19274,IX,"Which, be they what they may,"
19275,IX,"Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,"
19276,IX,Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;

19285,IX,"Hence, in a season of calm weather,"
19286,IX,"Though inland far we be,"
19287,IX,Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea
19288,IX,"Which brought us hither,"
19289,IX,Can in a moment travel thither

19318,XI,I only have relinquished one delight
19319,XI,To live beneath your more habitual sway.
19320,XI,"I love the Brooks, which down their channels fret,"
19321,XI,Even more than when I tripped lightly as they:
19322,XI,The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
19323,XI,Is lovely yet;
19324,XI,The Clouds that gather round the setting sun
19325,XI,Do take a sober coloring from an eye
19326,XI,That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
19327,XI,"Another race hath been, and other palms are won."
19328,XI,"Thanks to the human heart by which we live,"
19329,XI,"Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,"

21848,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21849,SONGS OF SEVEN,A song of a boat:--
21850,SONGS OF SEVEN,There was once a boat on a billow:
21851,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Lightly she rocked to her port remote,"
21852,SONGS OF SEVEN,"And the foam was white in her wake like snow,"
21853,SONGS OF SEVEN,"And her frail mast bowed when the breeze would blow,"
21854,SONGS OF SEVEN,And bent like a wand of willow.
21855,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21856,SONGS OF SEVEN,I shaded mine eyes one day when a boat
21857,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Went curtsying over the billow,"
21858,SONGS OF SEVEN,"I marked her course till a dancing mote,"
21859,SONGS OF SEVEN,"She faded out on the moonlit foam,"
21860,SONGS OF SEVEN,And I stayed behind in the dear-loved home;
21861,SONGS OF SEVEN,"And my thoughts all day were about the boat,"
21862,SONGS OF SEVEN,And my dreams upon the pillow.
21863,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21864,SONGS OF SEVEN,I pray you hear my song of a boat
21865,SONGS OF SEVEN,For it is but short:--
21866,SONGS OF SEVEN,"My boat you shall find none fairer afloat,"
21867,SONGS OF SEVEN,In river or port.
21868,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Long I looked out for the lad she bore,"
21869,SONGS OF SEVEN,"On the open desolate sea,"
21870,SONGS OF SEVEN,"And I think he sailed to the heavenly shore,"
21871,SONGS OF SEVEN,For he came not back to me--
21872,SONGS OF SEVEN,Ah me!
21873,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21874,SONGS OF SEVEN,A song of a nest:--
21875,SONGS OF SEVEN,There was once a nest in a hollow:
21876,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Down in the mosses and knot-grass pressed,"
21877,SONGS OF SEVEN,Soft and warm and full to the brim--
21878,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Vetches leaned over it purple, and dim,"
21879,SONGS OF SEVEN,With buttercup buds to follow.
21880,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21881,SONGS OF SEVEN,"I pray you hear my song of a nest,"
21882,SONGS OF SEVEN,For it is not long:--
21883,SONGS OF SEVEN,You shall never light in a summer quest
21884,SONGS OF SEVEN,The bushes among--
21885,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Shall never light on a prouder sitter,"
21886,SONGS OF SEVEN,"A fairer nestful, nor ever know"
21887,SONGS OF SEVEN,"A softer sound than their tender twitter,"
21888,SONGS OF SEVEN,That wind-like did come and go.
21889,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21890,SONGS OF SEVEN,"I had a nestful once of my own,"
21891,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Ah, happy, happy I!"
21892,SONGS OF SEVEN,Right dearly I loved them; but when they were grown
21893,SONGS OF SEVEN,They spread out their wings to fly--
21894,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Oh, one after one they flew away"
21895,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Far up to the heavenly blue,"
21896,SONGS OF SEVEN,"To the better country, the upper day,"
21897,SONGS OF SEVEN,And--I wish I was going too.
21898,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21899,SONGS OF SEVEN,"I pray you what is the nest to me,"
21900,SONGS OF SEVEN,My empty nest?
21901,SONGS OF SEVEN,And what is the shore where I stood to see
21902,SONGS OF SEVEN,My boat sail down to the west?
21903,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Can I call that home where I anchor yet,"
21904,SONGS OF SEVEN,Though my good man has sailed?
21905,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Can I call that home where my nest was set,"
21906,SONGS OF SEVEN,Now all its hope hath failed?
21907,SONGS OF SEVEN,
21908,SONGS OF SEVEN,"Nay, but the port where my sailor went,"
21909,SONGS OF SEVEN,And the land where my nestlings be:
21910,SONGS OF SEVEN,There is the home where my thoughts are sent
21911,SONGS OF SEVEN,The only home for me--
21912,SONGS OF SEVEN,Ah me!

21986,THE RETREAT,A several sin to every sense;

22284,THE WASTREL,"Along the sky-line, swallowed up the last kind light of day;"
22285,THE WASTREL,And then I seemed to hear you
22286,THE WASTREL,In the twilight; and be near you;
22287,THE WASTREL,Seemed to hear your dear voice calling--
22288,THE WASTREL,"Through the meadows, calling, calling--"
22289,THE WASTREL,"And I followed and I found you,"
22290,THE WASTREL,"Flung my tired arms around you,"

22296,THE WASTREL,Though I never looked enough ahead to ken the Inn of Fears;
22297,THE WASTREL,"Still I knew your heart was near me,"
22298,THE WASTREL,"That your ear was strained to hear me,"
22299,THE WASTREL,That your love would need no pleading
22300,THE WASTREL,"To forgive me, but was pleading"
22301,THE WASTREL,"Of its self that, in disaster,"
22302,THE WASTREL,I should run to you the faster
22303,THE WASTREL,And be sure that I was dearer for your sacrifice of tears.

22308,THE WASTREL,Night-passages that maze me with the ultimate dismay.
22309,THE WASTREL,Then when Death and Doubt shall blind me--
22310,THE WASTREL,Even then--I know you'll find me:
22311,THE WASTREL,"I shall hear you, Mother, calling--"
22312,THE WASTREL,Hear you calling--calling--calling:
22313,THE WASTREL,I shall fight and follow--find you
22314,THE WASTREL,"Though the grave-clothes swathe and bind you,"

22996,THE PET NAME,With sad associate thoughts the same?

23000,THE PET NAME,My brother gave that name to me
23001,THE PET NAME,"When we were children twain,"
23002,THE PET NAME,When names acquired baptismally
23003,THE PET NAME,"Were hard to utter, as to see"
23004,THE PET NAME,That life had any pain.
23005,THE PET NAME,
23006,THE PET NAME,"No shade was on us then, save one"
23007,THE PET NAME,Of chestnuts from the hill;
23008,THE PET NAME,And through the word our laugh did run
23009,THE PET NAME,"As part thereof: the mirth being done,"
23010,THE PET NAME,He calls me by it still.
23011,THE PET NAME,
23012,THE PET NAME,"Nay, do not smile!  I hear in it"
23013,THE PET NAME,"What none of you can hear,--"

23015,THE PET NAME,The bird and wind that did repeat
23016,THE PET NAME,"Around, our human cheer."
23017,THE PET NAME,
23018,THE PET NAME,I hear the birthday's noisy bliss
23019,THE PET NAME,"My sisters' woodland glee,"
23020,THE PET NAME,My father's praise I did not miss
23021,THE PET NAME,"When stooping down, he cared to kiss"
23022,THE PET NAME,"The poet at his knee,--"
23023,THE PET NAME,
23024,THE PET NAME,"And voices which, to name me, aye"
23025,THE PET NAME,"Their tenderest tones were keeping,--"
23026,THE PET NAME,To some I nevermore can say
23027,THE PET NAME,An answer till God wipes away
23028,THE PET NAME,In heaven these drops of weeping.
23029,THE PET NAME,
23030,THE PET NAME,My name to me a sadness wears:
23031,THE PET NAME,No murmurs cross my mind--
23032,THE PET NAME,"Now God be thanked for these thick tears,"
23033,THE PET NAME,"Which show, of those departed years,"
23034,THE PET NAME,Sweet memories left behind.
23035,THE PET NAME,
23036,THE PET NAME,Now God be thanked for years enwrought
23037,THE PET NAME,With love which softens yet:
23038,THE PET NAME,Now God be thanked for every thought
23039,THE PET NAME,Which is so tender it has caught
23040,THE PET NAME,Earth's guerdon of regret.
23041,THE PET NAME,
23042,THE PET NAME,"Earth saddens, never shall remove"
23043,THE PET NAME,Affections purely given;
23044,THE PET NAME,And e'en that mortal grief shall prove
23045,THE PET NAME,"The immortality of love,"
23046,THE PET NAME,And heighten it with Heaven.

23069,THREESCORE AND TEN,
23070,THREESCORE AND TEN,To have a place in the high choir

23088,THREESCORE AND TEN,The dear unrest.
23089,THREESCORE AND TEN,
23090,THREESCORE AND TEN,"Back on my past, through gathering tears,"

23442,THE BUCKET,
23443,THE BUCKET,"How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,"
23444,THE BUCKET,When fond recollection presents them to view!
23445,THE BUCKET,"The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood,"
23446,THE BUCKET,And every loved spot which my infancy knew!
23447,THE BUCKET,"The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it,"
23448,THE BUCKET,"The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell,"
23449,THE BUCKET,"The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it,"
23450,THE BUCKET,And e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well--
23451,THE BUCKET,"The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,"
23452,THE BUCKET,The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.
23453,THE BUCKET,
23454,THE BUCKET,"That moss-covered vessel I hailed as a treasure,"
23455,THE BUCKET,"For often at noon, when returned from the field,"
23456,THE BUCKET,"I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,"
23457,THE BUCKET,The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.
23458,THE BUCKET,"How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,"
23459,THE BUCKET,And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;
23460,THE BUCKET,"Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing,"
23461,THE BUCKET,"And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well--"
23462,THE BUCKET,"The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,"
23463,THE BUCKET,The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.
23464,THE BUCKET,
23465,THE BUCKET,"How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,"
23466,THE BUCKET,As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips!
23467,THE BUCKET,"Not a full blushing goblet would tempt me to leave it,"
23468,THE BUCKET,The brightest that beauty or revelry sips.
23469,THE BUCKET,"And now, far removed from the loved habitation,"
23470,THE BUCKET,"The tear of regret will intrusively swell,"
23471,THE BUCKET,"As fancy reverts to my father's plantation,"
23472,THE BUCKET,And sighs for the bucket that hangs in the well--
23473,THE BUCKET,"The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,"
23474,THE BUCKET,The moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well!

23496,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,On thy waving train is a playful hold
23497,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,Thou shalt never to lighter grasp persuade;
23498,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,"While a maiden sits in thy drooping fold,"

23505,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,"I think of thee still with a sweet regret,"
23506,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,"As the cordage yields to my playful grasp,--"
23507,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,Dost thou spring and cling in our woodlands yet?
23508,THE GRAPE-VINE SWING,Does the maiden still swing in thy giant clasp?

23541,THE OLD SWIMMIN'-HOLE,But the lost joys is past!  Let your tears in sorrow roll

23556,THE OLD SWIMMIN'-HOLE,Whare the old divin'-log lays sunk and fergot.

23569,FORTY YEARS AGO,"I've wandered to the village, Tom, I've sat beneath the tree,"
23570,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Upon the schoolhouse playground, that sheltered you and me;"
23571,FORTY YEARS AGO,"But none were there to greet me, Tom; and few were left to know,"
23572,FORTY YEARS AGO,Who played with us upon that green some forty years ago.
23573,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23574,FORTY YEARS AGO,"The grass is just as green, Tom; barefooted boys at play"
23575,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Were sporting, just as we did then, with spirits just as gay."
23576,FORTY YEARS AGO,"But the ""master"" sleeps upon the hill, which, coated o'er with snow,"
23577,FORTY YEARS AGO,Afforded us a sliding-place some forty years ago.
23578,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23579,FORTY YEARS AGO,The old schoolhouse is altered some; the benches are replaced
23580,FORTY YEARS AGO,"By new ones, very like the same our jackknives once defaced;"
23581,FORTY YEARS AGO,"But the same old bricks are in the wall, the bell swings to and fro;"
23582,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Its music's just the same, dear Tom, 'twas forty years ago."
23583,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23584,FORTY YEARS AGO,"The boys were playing some old game, beneath that same old tree;"
23585,FORTY YEARS AGO,"I have forgot the name just now--you've played the same with me,"
23586,FORTY YEARS AGO,"On that same spot; 'twas played with knives, by throwing so and so;"
23587,FORTY YEARS AGO,"The loser had a task to do, there, forty years ago."
23588,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23589,FORTY YEARS AGO,The river's running just as still; the willows on its side
23590,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Are larger than they were, Tom; the stream appears less wide;"
23591,FORTY YEARS AGO,"But the grape-vine swing is ruined now, where once we played the beau,"
23592,FORTY YEARS AGO,And swung our sweethearts--pretty girls--just forty years ago.
23593,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23594,FORTY YEARS AGO,"The spring that bubbled 'neath the hill, close by the spreading beech,"
23595,FORTY YEARS AGO,Is very low--'twas then so high that we could scarcely reach;
23596,FORTY YEARS AGO,"And, kneeling down to get a drink, dear Tom, I started so,"
23597,FORTY YEARS AGO,To see how sadly I am changed since forty years ago.
23598,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23599,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Near by that spring, upon an elm, you know I cut your name,"
23600,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Your sweetheart's just beneath it, Tom, and you did mine the same;"
23601,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark, 'twas dying sure but slow,"
23602,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Just as she died, whose name you cut, some forty years ago."
23603,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23604,FORTY YEARS AGO,"My lids have long been dry, Tom, but tears came to my eyes;"
23605,FORTY YEARS AGO,"I thought of her I loved so well, those early broken ties;"
23606,FORTY YEARS AGO,"I visited the old churchyard, and took some flowers to strow"
23607,FORTY YEARS AGO,Upon the graves of those we loved some forty years ago.
23608,FORTY YEARS AGO,
23609,FORTY YEARS AGO,"Some are in the churchyard laid, some sleep beneath the sea,"
23610,FORTY YEARS AGO,"And none are left of our old class, excepting you and me;"
23611,FORTY YEARS AGO,"But when our time shall come, Tom, and we are called to go,"
