317,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,illustrates the point. Did we not know that it was published some
318,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,"fifteen years ago in a volume entitled ""The Haunted Temple,"" we should"
319,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,assume that it was written on the occasion of the fall of the Czar. In

322,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,prophecy is one capable of repeated fulfillment.
323,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,
324,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,But it is as a prophet of nationalism that this man compels our
325,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,"particular attention. The prophecy is embodied in a play entitled ""The"

327,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,is a microcosm of American life. The chief character is a college

329,THE JEWS IN RUSSIA,nationalism and to give voice and utterance to the principle of

455,GENEVRA,the atmosphere that of a plague stricken city in a time when man was
456,GENEVRA,"helpless, authorities hopeless, social life in shreds and patches. The"
457,GENEVRA,"plot of the play founded on this state of affairs is rich in incident,"
458,GENEVRA,"varied and sufficiently complex in color, passion and character to"
459,GENEVRA,furnish material for an exciting spectacular representation. The
460,GENEVRA,"tragic element is strong, but supported and shaded by the company of"
461,GENEVRA,"roysterers, a jester, whose foolery is a compound of bluff of that"
462,GENEVRA,"period and bluff of modern politics and athletics. The jester, the black"
463,GENEVRA,"company and the penitents, together with the roysterers, form now the"
464,GENEVRA,"foreground, now the background, of action, which in itself is never"
465,GENEVRA,without the dolorous sound of the death bell. The doomed city is under

482,GENEVRA,"necessary to justify the dramatist in introducing the ""Crimson Cross."""
483,GENEVRA,It was a part of the pyrotechnics of the church propaganda. Though the
