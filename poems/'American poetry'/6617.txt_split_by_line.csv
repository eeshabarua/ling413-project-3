117,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
118,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"A wild Pink nestled in a garden bed,"
119,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"A rich Carnation flourished high above her,"
120,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,One day he chanced to see her pretty head
121,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"And leaned and looked again, and grew to love her."
122,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
123,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,The Moss (her humble mother) saw with fear
124,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,The ardent glances of the princely stranger;
125,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,With many an anxious thought and dewy tear
126,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,She sought to hide her darling from this danger.
127,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
128,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,The gardener-guardian of this noble bud
129,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,A cruel trellis interposed between them.
130,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"No common Pink should mate with royal blood,"
131,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"He said, and sought in every way to wean them."
132,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
133,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,The poor Pink pined and faded day by day:
134,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,Her restless lover from his prison bower
135,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"Called in a priestly bee who passed that way,"
136,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,And sent a message to the sorrowing flower.
137,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
138,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"The fainting Pink wept as the bee drew near,"
139,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"Droning his prayers, and begged him to confess her."
140,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"Her weary mother, over-taxed by fear,"
141,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"Slept, while the priest leaned low to shrive and bless her."
142,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
143,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"But lo! ere long the tale went creeping out,"
144,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,The rich Carnation and the Pink were married!
145,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,The cunning bee had brought the thing about
146,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,While Mamma Moss in Slumber’s arms had tarried.
147,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,
148,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"And proud descendants of that loving pair,"
149,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"The offspring of that true and ardent passion,"
150,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,"Are famous for their beauty everywhere,"
151,DOUBLE CARNATIONS,And leaders in the floral world of fashion.

159,NEVER MIND,"Whatever your work and whatever its worth,"
160,NEVER MIND,"No matter how strong or clever,"
161,NEVER MIND,"Some one will sneer if you pause to hear,"
162,NEVER MIND,And scoff at your best endeavour.
163,NEVER MIND,"For the target art has a broad expanse,"
164,NEVER MIND,"And wherever you chance to hit it,"
165,NEVER MIND,"Though close be your aim to the bull’s-eye fame,"
166,NEVER MIND,There are those who will never admit it.
167,NEVER MIND,
168,NEVER MIND,"Though the house applauds while the artist plays,"
169,NEVER MIND,"And a smiling world adores him,"
170,NEVER MIND,Somebody is there with an ennuied air
171,NEVER MIND,To say that the acting bores him.
172,NEVER MIND,"For the tower of art has a lofty spire,"
173,NEVER MIND,"With many a stair and landing,"
174,NEVER MIND,And those who climb seem small oft-time
175,NEVER MIND,To one at the bottom standing.
176,NEVER MIND,
177,NEVER MIND,So work along in your chosen niche
178,NEVER MIND,With a steady purpose to nerve you;
179,NEVER MIND,Let nothing men say who pass your way
180,NEVER MIND,Relax your courage or swerve you.
181,NEVER MIND,The idle will flock by the Temple of Art
182,NEVER MIND,For just the pleasure of gazing;
183,NEVER MIND,"But climb to the top and do not stop,"
184,NEVER MIND,Though they may not all be praising.

193,TWO WOMEN,"And cold as the snows on a winter waste,"
194,TWO WOMEN,Stainless ever in act and thought
195,TWO WOMEN,"(As a man, born dumb, in speech errs not)."
196,TWO WOMEN,"But she has malice toward her kind,"
197,TWO WOMEN,A cruel tongue and a jealous mind.
198,TWO WOMEN,"Void of pity and full of greed,"
199,TWO WOMEN,She judges the world by her narrow creed;
200,TWO WOMEN,"A brewer of quarrels, a breeder of hate,"
201,TWO WOMEN,Yet she holds the key to “Society’s” Gate.
202,TWO WOMEN,
203,TWO WOMEN,"The other woman, with heart of flame,"
204,TWO WOMEN,Went mad for a love that marred her name:
205,TWO WOMEN,And out of the grave of her murdered faith
206,TWO WOMEN,She rose like a soul that has passed through death.
207,TWO WOMEN,"Her aims are noble, her pity so broad,"
208,TWO WOMEN,It covers the world like the mercy of God.
209,TWO WOMEN,"A soother of discord, a healer of woes,"
210,TWO WOMEN,Peace follows her footsteps wherever she goes.
211,TWO WOMEN,"The worthier life of the two, no doubt,"
212,TWO WOMEN,And yet “Society” locks her out.

222,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,The honest years that speed along
223,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,Will trample in the dust.
224,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,In restless youth I railed at fate
225,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"With all my puny might,"
226,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,But now I know if I but wait
227,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,It all will come out right.
228,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,
229,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,Though Vice may don the judge’s gown
230,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"And play the censor’s part,"
231,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,And Fact be cowed by Falsehood’s frown
232,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,And Nature ruled by art;
233,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,Though Labour toils through blinding tears
234,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"And idle Wealth is might,"
235,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"I know the honest, earnest years"
236,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,Will bring it all out right.
237,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,
238,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,Though poor and loveless creeds may pass
239,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,For pure religion’s gold;

241,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"While truth meets glances cold,"
242,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"I know a law complete, sublime,"
243,IT ALL WILL COME OUT RIGHT,"Controls us with its might,"

299,THE WATCHER,"She gave her soul and body for a carriage,"
300,THE WATCHER,"And livened lackey with a vacant grin,"
301,THE WATCHER,"And all the rest—house, lands—and called it marriage:"
302,THE WATCHER,"The bargain made, a husband was thrown in."
303,THE WATCHER,
304,THE WATCHER,"And now, despite her luxury, she’s faded,"
305,THE WATCHER,Gone is the bloom that was so fresh and bright;
306,THE WATCHER,"She has the dark-rimmed eye, the countenance jaded,"
307,THE WATCHER,Of one who watches with the sick at night.
308,THE WATCHER,
309,THE WATCHER,"Ah, heaven, she does! her sick heart, sick and dying,"
310,THE WATCHER,"Beyond the aid of human skill to save,"
311,THE WATCHER,"In that cold room her breast is hourly lying,"
312,THE WATCHER,And her grim thoughts crowd near to dig its grave.
313,THE WATCHER,
314,THE WATCHER,"And yet it lingers, suffering and wailing,"
315,THE WATCHER,"As sick hearts will that feed upon despair,"
316,THE WATCHER,"And that lone watcher, unrelieved, is paling"
317,THE WATCHER,With vigils that no pitying soul can share.
318,THE WATCHER,
319,THE WATCHER,"Ah, lady! it is hardly what you thought it,"
320,THE WATCHER,This life of luxury and social power;
321,THE WATCHER,"You gave yourself as principal, and bought it,"
322,THE WATCHER,But God extracts the interest hour by hour.

364,THE LAW,
365,THE LAW,
366,THE LAW,"The sun may be clouded, yet ever the sun"
367,THE LAW,Will sweep on its course till the cycle is run.
368,THE LAW,"And when into chaos the systems are hurled,"
369,THE LAW,Again shall the Builder reshape a new world.
370,THE LAW,
371,THE LAW,"Your path may be clouded, uncertain your goal;"
372,THE LAW,"Move on, for the orbit is fixed for your soul."
373,THE LAW,"And though it may lead into darkness of night,"
374,THE LAW,The torch of the Builder shall give it new light.
375,THE LAW,
376,THE LAW,"You were, and you will be: know this while you are."
377,THE LAW,Your spirit has travelled both long and afar.
378,THE LAW,"It came from the Source, to the Source it returns;"
379,THE LAW,"The spark that was lighted, eternally burns."
380,THE LAW,
381,THE LAW,"It slept in the jewel, it leaped in the wave,"
382,THE LAW,"It roamed in the forest, it rose in the grave,"
383,THE LAW,"It took on strange garbs for long æons of years,"
384,THE LAW,And now in the soul of yourself it appears.
385,THE LAW,
386,THE LAW,From body to body your spirit speeds on;
387,THE LAW,It seeks a new form when the old one is gone;
388,THE LAW,And the form that it finds is the fabric you wrought
389,THE LAW,"On the loom of the mind, with the fibre of thought."
390,THE LAW,
391,THE LAW,"As dew is drawn upward, in rain to descend,"
392,THE LAW,Your thoughts drift away and in destiny blend.
393,THE LAW,"You cannot escape them; or petty, or great,"
394,THE LAW,"Or evil, or noble, they fashion your fate."
395,THE LAW,
396,THE LAW,"Somewhere on some planet, sometime and somehow,"

464,THE TWO AGES,On great cathedral window I have seen
465,THE TWO AGES,"A summer sunset swoon and sink away,"
466,THE TWO AGES,Lost in the splendours of immortal art.
467,THE TWO AGES,"Angels and saints and all the heavenly hosts,"
468,THE TWO AGES,"With smiles undimmed by half a thousand years,"
469,THE TWO AGES,From wall and niche have met my lifted gaze.
470,THE TWO AGES,"Sculpture and carving and illumined page,"
471,THE TWO AGES,"And the fair, lofty dreams of architects,"
472,THE TWO AGES,That speak of beauty to the centuries—
473,THE TWO AGES,All these have fed me with divine repasts.
474,THE TWO AGES,"Yet in my mouth is left a bitter taste,"
475,THE TWO AGES,The taste of blood that stained that age of art.
476,THE TWO AGES,
477,THE TWO AGES,Those glorious windows shine upon the black
478,THE TWO AGES,And hideous structure of the guillotine;
479,THE TWO AGES,Beside the haloed countenance of saints

492,THE TWO AGES,"And such large hopes of heaven, could entertain"
493,THE TWO AGES,Such hellish projects for their fellow-men?
494,THE TWO AGES,"How could the hand that, with consummate skill"
495,THE TWO AGES,"And loving patience, limned the luminous page,"
496,THE TWO AGES,"Drop pen and brush, and seize the branding-rod,"

505,THE TWO AGES,Yet great this age: its mighty work is man
506,THE TWO AGES,"Knowing himself, the universal life."
507,THE TWO AGES,"And great our faith, which shows itself in works"

816,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"The empty white hearse from the grave rumbled back,"
817,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,And the morning somehow seemed less smiling and gay
818,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"As I paused on the walk while it crossed on its way,"
819,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,And a shadow seemed drawn o’er the sun’s golden tract.
820,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,
821,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"Somebody’s baby was laid out to rest,"
822,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"White as a snowdrop, and fair to behold,"
823,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"And the soft little hands were crossed over the breast,"
824,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,And those hands and the lips and the eyelids were pressed
825,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,With kisses as hot as the eyelids were cold.
826,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,
827,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"Somebody saw it go out of her sight,"
828,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,Under the coffin lid—out through the door;
829,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,Somebody finds only darkness and blight
830,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,All through the glory of summer-sun light;
831,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,Somebody’s baby will waken no more.
832,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,
833,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,Somebody’s sorrow is making me weep:
834,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"I know not her name, but I echo her cry,"
835,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"For the dearly bought baby she longed so to keep,"
836,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,The baby that rode to its long-lasting sleep
837,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,In the little white hearse that went rumbling by.
838,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,
839,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"I know not her name, but her sorrow I know;"
840,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"While I paused on the crossing I lived it once more,"
841,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,And back to my heart surged that river of woe
842,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,That but in the breast of a mother can flow;
843,THE LITTLE WHITE HEARSE,"For the little white hearse has been, too, at _my_ door."

1002,LOVE’S SUPREMACY,"So does my love absorb each vain ambition,"
1003,LOVE’S SUPREMACY,Each outside purpose which my life has known.
1004,LOVE’S SUPREMACY,Stars cannot shine so near that vast orb’d splendour;
1005,LOVE’S SUPREMACY,They are content to feed his flames of fire:

1242,DUTY’S PATH,To brim joy’s largest measure.

1392,AN ERRING WOMAN’S LOVE,
1393,PART I,PART I
1394,PART I,
1395,PART I,
1396,PART I,She was a light and wanton maid:
1397,PART I,"Not one whom fickle Love betrayed,"
1398,PART I,For indolence was her undoer.
1399,PART I,"Fair, frivolous, and very poor,"
1400,PART I,"She scorned the thought of toil, in youth,"
1401,PART I,And chose the path that leads from truth.
1402,PART I,
1403,PART I,More women fall from want of gold
1404,PART I,"Than love leads wrong, if truth were told;"
1405,PART I,More women sin for gay attire
1406,PART I,Than sin through passion’s blinding fire.
1407,PART I,Her god was gold: and gold she saw
1408,PART I,Prove mightier than the sternest law
1409,PART I,"With judge and jury, priest and king;"
1410,PART I,"So, made herself an offering"
1411,PART I,"At Mammon’s shrine; and lived for power,"
1412,PART I,"And ease, and pleasures of the hour."
1413,PART I,
1414,PART I,Who looks beneath life’s outer crust
1415,PART I,Is satisfied that God is just;
1416,PART I,"Who looks not under, but about,"
1417,PART I,Finds much to make him sad with doubt.
1418,PART I,"For Virtue walks with feet worn bare,"
1419,PART I,While Sin rides by with coach and pair:
1420,PART I,"Men praise the modest heart and chaste,"
1421,PART I,"And yet they let it go to waste,"
1422,PART I,"And follow, fierce to have and hold,"
1423,PART I,"Some creature, wanton, selfish, bold."
1424,PART I,
1425,PART I,"She saw but this, life’s outer side,"
1426,PART I,No higher faith was hers to guide;
1427,PART I,"She worshipped gold, and hated toil,"
1428,PART I,"And hence her youth with all its soil,"
1429,PART I,"With all its sins too dark to name,"
1430,PART I,"Of secret crimes and public shame,"
1431,PART I,"With all its trail of broken lives,"
1432,PART I,"Of ruined homes, neglected wives,"
1433,PART I,And weeping mothers.  Proud and gay
1434,PART I,She went her devastating way
1435,PART I,With untouched brow and fadeless grace.
1436,PART I,
1437,PART I,"Not time, but feeling, marks the face."
1438,PART I,Sin on the outer being tells
1439,PART I,Not till the startled soul rebels:
1440,PART I,And she felt nothing but content.
1441,PART I,She was too light and indolent
1442,PART I,To worry over days to come.
1443,PART I,"This little earth held all life’s sum,"
1444,PART I,"She thought, and to be young and fair,"
1445,PART I,"Well clothed, well fed, was all her care."
1446,PART I,With pitying eyes and lifted head
1447,PART I,"She gazed on those who toiled for bread,"
1448,PART I,And laughed to scorn the talk she heard
1449,PART I,"Of punishment for those who erred,"
1450,PART I,And virtue’s certain recompense.
1451,PART I,"She seemed devoid of moral sense,"
1452,PART I,An ignorant thing whose appetites
1453,PART I,Bound her horizon of delights.
1454,PART I,
1455,PART I,Men were her puppets to control;
1456,PART I,Unconscious of a heart or soul
1457,PART I,"She lived, and gloried in the ease"
1458,PART I,She purchased by her power to please
1459,PART I,The eye and senses.  Life’s one woe
1460,PART I,Which caused her pitying tears to flow
1461,PART I,Was poverty.  Though hearts might break
1462,PART I,"And homes be ruined for her sake,"
1463,PART I,She showed no mercy.  But when need
1464,PART I,"Of gold she saw, her heart would bleed."
1465,PART I,"The lack of clothing, fire, and food"
1466,PART I,"Was earth’s one pain, she understood."
1467,PART I,
1468,PART I,"The suffering poor oft blest her name,"
1469,PART I,"Nor questioned whence the ducats came,"
1470,PART I,She gave so freely.  Once she found
1471,PART I,"A fainting woman on the ground,"
1472,PART I,A wailing child clasped to her breast.
1473,PART I,With her own hands she bathed and dressed
1474,PART I,The weary waifs! gave food and gold
1475,PART I,"And clothed them warmly from the cold,"
1476,PART I,Nor guessed that one she lured from home
1477,PART I,Had caused that suffering pair to roam
1478,PART I,"Unhoused, neglected.  Then one day,"
1479,PART I,"Unheralded across her way,"
1480,PART I,"The conqueror came.  She knew not why,"
1481,PART I,But with the first glance of his eye
1482,PART I,"A feeling, new and unexplained,"
1483,PART I,Woke in her what she oft had feigned.
1484,PART I,"And when his arm stole near her waist,"
1485,PART I,As startled maidens blush with chaste
1486,PART I,"Sweet fear at love’s advances, so"
1487,PART I,She blushed from brow to breast of snow.
1488,PART I,"Strange, new emotions, fraught with joy"
1489,PART I,"And pain commingled, made her coy;"
1490,PART I,But when he would have clasped her neck
1491,PART I,With gems that might a queen bedeck
1492,PART I,"And offered gold, her lips grew white"
1493,PART I,With sudden anger at the sight
1494,PART I,Of what had been her god for years.
1495,PART I,She flung them from her.  Then such tears
1496,PART I,As only spring from love’s despair
1497,PART I,"Welled from her eyes.  “So, lady fair,"
1498,PART I,"My gifts are scorned?” quoth he, and laughed."
1499,PART I,"“Like Cleopatra, you have quaffed"
1500,PART I,"Such lordly pearls in draughts of wine,"
1501,PART I,You spurn poor simple gems like mine.
1502,PART I,"Well, well, fair queen, I’ll bring to you"
1503,PART I,A richer gift next time.  Adieu.”
1504,PART I,
1505,PART I,His light words stung like lash of whip;
1506,PART I,With gasping breath and ashen lip
1507,PART I,"She strove to speak, but he was gone"
1508,PART I,She kneeled and pressed her mouth upon
1509,PART I,"The latch his hand had touched, the floor"
1510,PART I,"His foot had trod, and o’er and o’er"
1511,PART I,"She sobbed his name, as children moan"
1512,PART I,A mother’s name when left alone.
1513,PART I,
1514,PART I,Out from the dim and roseate gloom
1515,PART I,And subtle odours of her room
1516,PART I,Accusing memories rose.  She felt
1517,PART I,A loneliness that seemed to belt
1518,PART I,The universe in its embrace.
1519,PART I,It was as if from some high place
1520,PART I,A giant hand had reached and hurled
1521,PART I,"To nothingness her petty world,"
1522,PART I,"And left her staring, awed, alone,"
1523,PART I,"Up into regions vast, unknown."
1524,PART I,There is no other loneliness
1525,PART I,That can so sadden and oppress
1526,PART I,As when beside the burned-out fire
1527,PART I,Of sated passion and desire
1528,PART I,"The wakening spirit, in a glance,"
1529,PART I,Beholds its lost inheritance.
1530,PART I,"She rose and turned the dim lights higher,"
1531,PART I,"Brought forth rich gems and grand attire,"
1532,PART I,And robed herself in feverish haste;
1533,PART I,"Before the mirror posed and paced,"
1534,PART I,With jewels on her breast and wrists;
1535,PART I,Then sudden clenched her little fists
1536,PART I,"And beat her face until it bled,"
1537,PART I,"And tore her garments shred from shred,"
1538,PART I,"Gazed in the mirror, spoke her name"
1539,PART I,"And hissed a word that told her shame,"
1540,PART I,Then on her knees fell sobbing there.
1541,PART I,
1542,PART I,There are sweet messengers of prayer
1543,PART I,"Who down through space on soft wings steal,"
1544,PART I,And offer aid to all who kneel.
1545,PART I,"Her lips, unused to pious phrase,"
1546,PART I,"Recalled some words of bygone days,"
1547,PART I,"And “Now I lay me down to sleep,"
1548,PART I,"I pray the Lord my soul to keep,”"
1549,PART I,"She whispered timidly, and then,"
1550,PART I,"“Lord, let me be a child again"
1551,PART I,"And grow up good.”  The strange prayer said,"
1552,PART I,"Like some o’er-weary child, her head"
1553,PART I,"She pillowed on her arm, and wept"
1554,PART I,"Low, shuddering sobs, until she slept"
1555,PART I,And dreamed; and in that dream she thought
1556,PART I,She sat within a vine-wreathed cot;
1557,PART I,"An infant slumbered on her breast,"
1558,PART I,"She crooned a lullaby, and pressed"
1559,PART I,"Its waxen hand against her cheek,"
1560,PART I,"While one, too proud and fond to speak,"
1561,PART I,"The happy father of the child,"
1562,PART I,"Stood near, and gazing on them, smiled."
1563,PART I,
1564,PART I,She woke while still the lullaby
1565,PART I,"Was on her lips—then such a cry,"
1566,PART I,As souls in fabled realms below
1567,PART I,"Might utter, voiced her awful woe."
1568,PART I,
1569,PART I,The mighty moral labour-pain
1570,PART I,Of new-born conscience wracked her brain
1571,PART I,And tore her soul.  She understood
1572,PART I,"The meaning now of womanhood,"
1573,PART I,"And chastity, and o’er her came"
1574,PART I,"The full, dark sense of all her shame."
1575,PART I,"As some poor drunken wretch, at night,"
1576,PART I,"Wakes up to know his piteous plight,"
1577,PART I,"And sees, while sinking in the mire,"
1578,PART I,"Afar, his waiting hearth-light’s fire;"
1579,PART I,So now she saw from depths of sin
1580,PART I,The hearth-light of the might-have-been.
1581,PART I,"How beautiful, how like a star"
1582,PART I,"That lost light shone, but ah, how far!"
1583,PART I,
1584,PART I,"She reached her longing arms toward space,"
1585,PART I,And lifted up her tear-wet face.
1586,PART I,"“O God,” she wailed, “I have been bad!"
1587,PART I,"I see it all, and I am sad,"
1588,PART I,And long to be a good girl now.
1589,PART I,"Lord, Lord, will some one show me how?"
1590,PART I,"Why, men have trod the burning track"
1591,PART I,"Of sin for years, and then gone back!"
1592,PART I,"And cannot I for sin atone,"
1593,PART I,Or did Christ die for men alone?
1594,PART I,"I want to lead an honest life,"
1595,PART I,I want to be his own true wife
1596,PART I,And hold upon my breast his child.”
1597,PART I,"Then suddenly her voice grew wild,"
1598,PART I,"“No, no,” she cried, “it could not be—"
1599,PART I,Those infant eyes would torture me:
1600,PART I,"Though God condoned my sinful ways,"
1601,PART I,I could not meet my child’s pure gaze.”
1602,PART I,
1603,PART I,"She hid her face upon her knees,"
1604,PART I,And swayed as reeds sway in a breeze.
1605,PART I,"“O Christ,” she moaned, “could I forget,"
1606,PART I,There might be something for me yet:
1607,PART I,"But though both God and man forgave,"
1608,PART I,"And I should win the love I crave,"
1609,PART I,"Why, memory would drive me mad.”"
1610,PART I,
1611,PART I,"When woman drifts from good to bad,"
1612,PART I,"To make her final fall complete,"
1613,PART I,She puts her soul beneath her feet.
1614,PART I,Man’s dual selves seem separate;
1615,PART I,"He leaves his soul outside sin’s gate,"
1616,PART I,And finds it waiting when he tires
1617,PART I,"Of carnal pleasures and desires,"
1618,PART I,"Depleted, sickened, and depressed,"
1619,PART I,"As souls must be with such a test,"
1620,PART I,Yet strong enough to help him grope
1621,PART I,Back into happiness and hope.
1622,PART I,"But woman, far more complicate,"
1623,PART I,Can take no chances with her fate;
1624,PART I,"A subtle creature, finely spun,"
1625,PART I,Her body and her soul are one.
1626,PART I,And now this erring woman wept
1627,PART I,The soul she murdered while it slept.
1628,PART I,She felt too stunned with pain to think.
1629,PART I,She seemed to stand upon a brink;
1630,PART I,"Behind her loomed the sinful past,"
1631,PART I,"Below her, rocks, beyond her, vast"
1632,PART I,And awful darkness.  Not one ray
1633,PART I,Of sun or star to show the way!
1634,PART I,She drew a long and shuddering breath;
1635,PART I,“There is no other path but death
1636,PART I,"For me to tread,” she sighed, “and so"
1637,PART I,I will prepare my house and go.”
1638,PART I,
1639,PART I,As housewives move with willing feet
1640,PART I,And skilful hands to make things neat
1641,PART I,"And ready for some welcome one,"
1642,PART I,She toiled until her tasks were done.
1643,PART I,"Then, seated at her desk, she wrote,"
1644,PART I,"With painful care, a tear-wet note."
1645,PART I,"The childish penmanship was rude,"
1646,PART I,"Ill spelled the words, the phrasing crude;"
1647,PART I,"Yet thought and feeling both were there,"
1648,PART I,And mighty love and great despair.
1649,PART I,"“Dear heart,” it ran, “you did not know"
1650,PART I,"How, from the first, I loved you so,"

1652,PART I,And so I leave it all to-night.
1653,PART I,"The kiss I gave, dear heart, to you"

1664,PART I,"When woman errs, and then regrets,"

1671,PART I,"I saw there was a wrong and right,"

1684,PART I,Of loneliness and dark disgrace.
1685,PART I,There cannot be another place

1695,PART I,With nothing but a broken spar.

2495,A SUGGESTION,Let the wild red-rose bloom.  Though not to thee
2496,A SUGGESTION,So delicately perfect as the white
2497,A SUGGESTION,"And unwed lily drooping in the light,"
2498,A SUGGESTION,Though she has known the kisses of the bee
2499,A SUGGESTION,And tells her amorous tale to passers-by
2500,A SUGGESTION,"In perfumed whispers and with untaught grace,"
2501,A SUGGESTION,Still let the red-rose bloom in her own place;
2502,A SUGGESTION,She could not be the lily should she try.
2503,A SUGGESTION,
2504,A SUGGESTION,Why to the wondrous nightingale cry hush
2505,A SUGGESTION,"Or bid her cease her wild heart-breaking lay,"
2506,A SUGGESTION,And tune her voice to imitate the way
2507,A SUGGESTION,"The whip-poor-will makes music, or the thrush?"
2508,A SUGGESTION,"All airs of sorrow to one theme belong,"
2509,A SUGGESTION,And passion is not copyrighted yet.
2510,A SUGGESTION,Each heart writes its own music.  Why not let
