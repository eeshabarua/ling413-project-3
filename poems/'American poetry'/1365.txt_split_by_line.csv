697,PRELUDE,PRELUDE
698,PRELUDE,
699,PRELUDE,"Pleasant it was, when woods were green,"
700,PRELUDE,"And winds were soft and low,"
701,PRELUDE,To lie amid some sylvan scene.
702,PRELUDE,"Where, the long drooping boughs between,"
703,PRELUDE,Shadows dark and sunlight sheen
704,PRELUDE,Alternate come and go;
705,PRELUDE,
706,PRELUDE,Or where the denser grove receives
707,PRELUDE,"No sunlight from above,"
708,PRELUDE,But the dark foliage interweaves
709,PRELUDE,"In one unbroken roof of leaves,"
710,PRELUDE,Underneath whose sloping eaves
711,PRELUDE,The shadows hardly move.
712,PRELUDE,
713,PRELUDE,Beneath some patriarchal tree
714,PRELUDE,I lay upon the ground;
715,PRELUDE,"His hoary arms uplifted he,"
716,PRELUDE,And all the broad leaves over me
717,PRELUDE,"Clapped their little hands in glee,"
718,PRELUDE,With one continuous sound;—
719,PRELUDE,
720,PRELUDE,"A slumberous sound, a sound that brings"
721,PRELUDE,"The feelings of a dream,"
722,PRELUDE,"As of innumerable wings,"
723,PRELUDE,"As, when a bell no longer swings,"
724,PRELUDE,Faint the hollow murmur rings
725,PRELUDE,"O’er meadow, lake, and stream."
726,PRELUDE,
727,PRELUDE,"And dreams of that which cannot die,"
728,PRELUDE,"Bright visions, came to me,"
729,PRELUDE,"As lapped in thought I used to lie,"
730,PRELUDE,"And gaze into the summer sky,"
731,PRELUDE,"Where the sailing clouds went by,"
732,PRELUDE,Like ships upon the sea;
733,PRELUDE,
734,PRELUDE,Dreams that the soul of youth engage
735,PRELUDE,Ere Fancy has been quelled;
736,PRELUDE,"Old legends of the monkish page,"
737,PRELUDE,"Traditions of the saint and sage,"
738,PRELUDE,"Tales that have the rime of age,"
739,PRELUDE,And chronicles of Eld.
740,PRELUDE,
741,PRELUDE,"And, loving still these quaint old themes,"
742,PRELUDE,Even in the city’s throng
743,PRELUDE,"I feel the freshness of the streams,"
744,PRELUDE,"That, crossed by shades and sunny gleams,"
745,PRELUDE,"Water the green land of dreams,"
746,PRELUDE,The holy land of song.
747,PRELUDE,
748,PRELUDE,"Therefore, at Pentecost, which brings"
749,PRELUDE,"The Spring, clothed like a bride,"
750,PRELUDE,"When nestling buds unfold their wings,"
751,PRELUDE,"And bishop’s-caps have golden rings,"
752,PRELUDE,"Musing upon many things,"
753,PRELUDE,I sought the woodlands wide.
754,PRELUDE,
755,PRELUDE,The green trees whispered low and mild;
756,PRELUDE,It was a sound of joy!
757,PRELUDE,"They were my playmates when a child,"
758,PRELUDE,And rocked me in their arms so wild!
759,PRELUDE,"Still they looked at me and smiled,"
760,PRELUDE,As if I were a boy;
761,PRELUDE,
762,PRELUDE,"And ever whispered, mild and low,"
763,PRELUDE,"“Come, be a child once more!”"
764,PRELUDE,"And waved their long arms to and fro,"
765,PRELUDE,And beckoned solemnly and slow;
766,PRELUDE,"O, I could not choose but go"
767,PRELUDE,"Into the woodlands hoar,—"
768,PRELUDE,
769,PRELUDE,"Into the blithe and breathing air,"
770,PRELUDE,"Into the solemn wood,"
771,PRELUDE,Solemn and silent everywhere
772,PRELUDE,Nature with folded hands seemed there
773,PRELUDE,Kneeling at her evening prayer!
774,PRELUDE,Like one in prayer I stood.
775,PRELUDE,
776,PRELUDE,Before me rose an avenue
777,PRELUDE,Of tall and sombrous pines;
778,PRELUDE,"Abroad their fan-like branches grew,"
779,PRELUDE,"And, where the sunshine darted through,"
780,PRELUDE,"Spread a vapor soft and blue,"
781,PRELUDE,In long and sloping lines.
782,PRELUDE,
783,PRELUDE,"And, falling on my weary brain,"
784,PRELUDE,"Like a fast-falling shower,"
785,PRELUDE,"The dreams of youth came back again,"
786,PRELUDE,"Low lispings of the summer rain,"
787,PRELUDE,"Dropping on the ripened grain,"
788,PRELUDE,As once upon the flower.
789,PRELUDE,
790,PRELUDE,"Visions of childhood! Stay, O stay!"
791,PRELUDE,Ye were so sweet and wild!
792,PRELUDE,"And distant voices seemed to say,"
793,PRELUDE,“It cannot be! They pass away!
794,PRELUDE,Other themes demand thy lay;
795,PRELUDE,Thou art no more a child!
796,PRELUDE,
797,PRELUDE,"“The land of Song within thee lies,"
798,PRELUDE,Watered by living springs;
799,PRELUDE,The lids of Fancy’s sleepless eyes
800,PRELUDE,"Are gates unto that Paradise,"
801,PRELUDE,"Holy thoughts, like stars, arise,"
802,PRELUDE,Its clouds are angels’ wings.
803,PRELUDE,
804,PRELUDE,"“Learn, that henceforth thy song shall be,"
805,PRELUDE,"Not mountains capped with snow,"
806,PRELUDE,"Nor forests sounding like the sea,"
807,PRELUDE,"Nor rivers flowing ceaselessly,"
808,PRELUDE,Where the woodlands bend to see
809,PRELUDE,The bending heavens below.
810,PRELUDE,
811,PRELUDE,“There is a forest where the din
812,PRELUDE,Of iron branches sounds!
813,PRELUDE,"A mighty river roars between,"
814,PRELUDE,And whosoever looks therein
815,PRELUDE,"Sees the heavens all black with sin,"
816,PRELUDE,"Sees not its depths, nor bounds."
817,PRELUDE,
818,PRELUDE,"“Athwart the swinging branches cast,"
819,PRELUDE,Soft rays of sunshine pour;
820,PRELUDE,Then comes the fearful wintry blast
821,PRELUDE,"Our hopes, like withered leaves, fail fast;"
822,PRELUDE,"Pallid lips say, ‘It is past!"
823,PRELUDE,We can return no more!’
824,PRELUDE,
825,PRELUDE,"“Look, then, into thine heart, and write!"
826,PRELUDE,"Yes, into Life’s deep stream!"
827,PRELUDE,"All forms of sorrow and delight,"
828,PRELUDE,"All solemn Voices of the Night,"
829,PRELUDE,"That can soothe thee, or affright,—"
830,PRELUDE,Be these henceforth thy theme.”

1669,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Still in rude armor drest,"
1670,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Comest to daunt me!
1671,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Wrapt not in Eastern balms,"
1672,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Bat with thy fleshless palms
1673,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Stretched, as if asking alms,"
1674,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Why dost thou haunt me?"""
1675,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1676,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Then, from those cavernous eyes"
1677,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Pale flashes seemed to rise,"
1678,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,As when the Northern skies
1679,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Gleam in December;
1680,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And, like the water's flow"
1681,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Under December's snow,"
1682,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Came a dull voice of woe
1683,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,From the heart's chamber.
1684,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1685,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""I was a Viking old!"
1686,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"My deeds, though manifold,"
1687,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"No Skald in song has told,"
1688,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,No Saga taught thee!
1689,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Take heed, that in thy verse"
1690,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Thou dost the tale rehearse,"
1691,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Else dread a dead man's curse;
1692,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,For this I sought thee.
1693,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1694,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Far in the Northern Land,"
1695,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"By the wild Baltic's strand,"
1696,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"I, with my childish hand,"
1697,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Tamed the gerfalcon;
1698,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And, with my skates fast-bound,"
1699,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Skimmed the half-frozen Sound,"
1700,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,That the poor whimpering hound
1701,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Trembled to walk on.
1702,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1703,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Oft to his frozen lair"
1704,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Tracked I the grisly bear,"
1705,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,While from my path the hare
1706,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fled like a shadow;
1707,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Oft through the forest dark
1708,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Followed the were-wolf's bark,"
1709,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Until the soaring lark
1710,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Sang from the meadow.
1711,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1712,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""But when I older grew,"
1713,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Joining a corsair's crew,"
1714,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,O'er the dark sea I flew
1715,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,With the marauders.
1716,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Wild was the life we led;
1717,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Many the souls that sped,"
1718,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Many the hearts that bled,"
1719,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,By our stern orders.
1720,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1721,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Many a wassail-bout"
1722,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Wore the long Winter out;
1723,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Often our midnight shout
1724,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Set the cocks crowing,"
1725,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,As we the Berserk's tale
1726,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Measured in cups of ale,"
1727,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Draining the oaken pail,"
1728,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Filled to o'erflowing.
1729,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1730,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Once as I told in glee"
1731,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Tales of the stormy sea,"
1732,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Soft eyes did gaze on me,"
1733,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Burning yet tender;
1734,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And as the white stars shine
1735,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"On the dark Norway pine,"
1736,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,On that dark heart of mine
1737,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fell their soft splendor.
1738,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1739,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""I wooed the blue-eyed maid,"
1740,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Yielding, yet half afraid,"
1741,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And in the forest's shade
1742,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Our vows were plighted.
1743,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Under its loosened vest
1744,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fluttered her little breast
1745,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Like birds within their nest
1746,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,By the hawk frighted.
1747,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1748,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Bright in her father's hall"
1749,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Shields gleamed upon the wall,"
1750,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Loud sang the minstrels all,"
1751,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Chanting his glory;
1752,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,When of old Hildebrand
1753,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"I asked his daughter's hand,"
1754,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Mute did the minstrels stand
1755,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,To hear my story.
1756,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1757,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""While the brown ale he quaffed,"
1758,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Loud then the champion laughed,"
1759,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And as the wind-gusts waft
1760,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"The sea-foam brightly,"
1761,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"So the loud laugh of scorn,"
1762,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Out of those lips unshorn,"
1763,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,From the deep drinking-horn
1764,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Blew the foam lightly.
1765,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1766,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""She was a Prince's child,"
1767,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"I but a Viking wild,"
1768,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And though she blushed and smiled,"
1769,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,I was discarded!
1770,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Should not the dove so white
1771,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Follow the sea-mew's flight,"
1772,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Why did they leave that night
1773,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Her nest unguarded?
1774,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1775,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Scarce had I put to sea,"
1776,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Bearing the maid with me,"
1777,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Fairest of all was she
1778,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Among the Norsemen!
1779,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"When on the white sea-strand,"
1780,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Waving his armed hand,"
1781,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Saw we old Hildebrand,"
1782,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,With twenty horsemen.
1783,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1784,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Then launched they to the blast,"
1785,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Bent like a reed each mast,"
1786,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Yet we were gaining fast,"
1787,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,When the wind failed us;
1788,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,And with a sudden flaw
1789,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Came round the gusty Skaw,"
1790,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,So that our foe we saw
1791,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Laugh as he hailed us.
1792,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1793,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""And as to catch the gale"
1794,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Round veered the flapping sail,"
1795,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Death I was the helmsman's hail,"
1796,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Death without quarter!
1797,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Mid-ships with iron keel
1798,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Struck we her ribs of steel
1799,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Down her black hulk did reel
1800,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Through the black water!
1801,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1802,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""As with his wings aslant,"
1803,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Sails the fierce cormorant,"
1804,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Seeking some rocky haunt
1805,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"With his prey laden,"
1806,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"So toward the open main,"
1807,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Beating to sea again,"
1808,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Through the wild hurricane,"
1809,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Bore I the maiden.
1810,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1811,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Three weeks we westward bore,"
1812,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"And when the storm was o'er,"
1813,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Cloud-like we saw the shore
1814,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Stretching to leeward;
1815,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,There for my lady's bower
1816,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Built I the lofty tower,"
1817,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Which, to this very hour,"
1818,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Stands looking seaward.
1819,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1820,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""There lived we many years;"
1821,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Time dried the maiden's tears
1822,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"She had forgot her fears,"
1823,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,She was a mother.
1824,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Death closed her mild blue eyes,"
1825,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Under that tower she lies;
1826,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Ne'er shall the sun arise
1827,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,On such another!
1828,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1829,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Still grew my bosom then."
1830,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Still as a stagnant fen!
1831,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Hateful to me were men,"
1832,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,The sunlight hateful!
1833,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"In the vast forest here,"
1834,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Clad in my warlike gear,"
1835,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Fell I upon my spear,"
1836,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"O, death was grateful!"
1837,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,
1838,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"""Thus, seamed with many scars,"
1839,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Bursting these prison bars,"
1840,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,Up to its native stars
1841,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,My soul ascended!
1842,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,There from the flowing bowl
1843,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Deep drinks the warrior's soul,"
1844,THE SKELETON IN ARMOR,"Skoal! to the Northland! skoal!"""

1850,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1851,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"It was the schooner Hesperus,"
1852,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,That sailed the wintry sea;
1853,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And the skipper had taken his little daughter,"
1854,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,To bear him company.
1855,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1856,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax,"
1857,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Her cheeks like the dawn of day,"
1858,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,"

1861,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The skipper he stood beside the helm,"
1862,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"His pipe was in his month,"
1863,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And he watched how the veering flaw did blow
1864,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The smoke now West, now South."
1865,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1866,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Then up and spake an old Sailor,"

1873,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,"
1874,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And a scornful laugh laughed he.
1875,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1876,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Colder and louder blew the wind,"
1877,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,A gale from the Northeast.
1878,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The snow fell hissing in the brine,"
1879,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And the billows frothed like yeast.
1880,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1881,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Down came the storm, and smote amain"
1882,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,The vessel in its strength;
1883,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,"
1884,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Then leaped her cable's length.
1885,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1886,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,"
1887,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And do not tremble so;
1888,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,For  I can weather the roughest gale
1889,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"That ever wind did blow."""
1890,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1891,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1892,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,He wrapped her warm in his seaman's coat
1893,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Against the stinging blast;
1894,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"He cut a rope from a broken spar,"
1895,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And bound her to the mast.
1896,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1897,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""O father! I hear the church-bells ring,"
1898,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"O say, what may it be?"""
1899,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"""'Tis a fog-bell on a rock-bound coast!""--"
1900,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And he steered for the open sea.

1909,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"But the father answered never a word,"
1910,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,A frozen corpse was he.
1911,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1912,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,"
1913,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"With his face turned to the skies,"
1914,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
1915,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On his fixed and glassy eyes.
1916,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1917,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
1918,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,That saved she might be;
1919,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave,"
1920,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On the Lake of Galilee.
1921,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,

1924,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept"
1925,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Tow'rds the reef of Norman's Woe.
1926,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1927,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And ever the fitful gusts between
1928,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,A sound came from the land;
1929,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,It was the sound of the trampling surf
1930,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.
1931,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1932,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The breakers were right beneath her bows,"
1933,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"She drifted a dreary wreck,"
1934,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,And a whooping billow swept the crew
1935,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Like icicles from her deck.
1936,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1937,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,She struck where the white and fleecy waves
1938,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Looked soft as carded wool,"
1939,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"But the cruel rocks, they gored her side"
1940,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Like the horns of an angry bull.
1941,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1942,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,"
1943,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,With the masts went by the board;

1945,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,Ho! ho! the breakers roared!
1946,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1947,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"At daybreak, on the bleak sea-beach,"
1948,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"A fisherman stood aghast,"
1949,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"To see the form of a maiden fair,"

1951,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1952,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"The salt sea was frozen on her breast,"
1953,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,The salt tears in her eyes;
1954,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"And he saw her hair, like the brown sea-weed,"
1955,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,On the billows fall and rise.
1956,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,
1957,THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS,"Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,"

2495,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2496,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"Beside the ungathered rice he lay,"
2497,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,His sickle in his hand;
2498,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"His breast was bare, his matted hair"
2499,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Was buried in the sand.
2500,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"Again, in the mist and shadow of sleep,"
2501,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,He saw his Native Land.
2502,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2503,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Wide through the landscape of his dreams
2504,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,The lordly Niger flowed;
2505,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Beneath the palm-trees on the plain
2506,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Once more a king he strode;
2507,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,And heard the tinkling caravans
2508,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Descend the mountain-road.
2509,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2510,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,He saw once more his dark-eyed queen
2511,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Among her children stand;
2512,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"They clasped his neck, they kissed his cheeks,"
2513,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,They held him by the hand!--
2514,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,A tear burst from the sleeper's lids
2515,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,And fell into the sand.
2516,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2517,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,And then at furious speed he rode
2518,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Along the Niger's bank;
2519,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"His bridle-reins were golden chains,"
2520,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"And, with a martial clank,"
2521,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,At each leap he could feel his scabbard of steel
2522,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Smiting his stallion's flank.
2523,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2524,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"Before him, like a blood-red flag,"
2525,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,The bright flamingoes flew;
2526,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"From morn till night he followed their flight,"
2527,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"O'er plains where the tamarind grew,"
2528,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"Till he saw the roofs of Caffre huts,"
2529,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,And the ocean rose to view.
2530,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2531,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"At night he heard the lion roar,"
2532,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"And the hyena scream,"
2533,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"And the river-horse, as he crushed the reeds"
2534,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Beside some hidden stream;
2535,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"And it passed, like a glorious roll of drums,"
2536,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Through the triumph of his dream.
2537,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2538,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"The forests, with their myriad tongues,"
2539,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Shouted of liberty;
2540,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"And the Blast of the Desert cried aloud,"
2541,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"With a voice so wild and free,"
2542,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,That he started in his sleep and smiled
2543,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,At their tempestuous glee.
2544,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,
2545,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"He did not feel the driver's whip,"
2546,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Nor the burning heat of day;
2547,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"For Death had illumined the Land of Sleep,"
2548,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,And his lifeless body lay
2549,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,"A worn-out fetter, that the soul"
2550,THE SLAVE'S DREAM,Had broken and thrown away!

2849,ACT I.,Pray who was there?
2850,ACT I.,
2851,ACT I.,Lara.  Why all the town and court.
2852,ACT I.,The house was crowded; and the busy fans
2853,ACT I.,Among the gayly dressed and perfumed ladies
2854,ACT I.,Fluttered like butterflies among the flowers.
2855,ACT I.,There was the Countess of Medina Celi;
2856,ACT I.,"The Goblin Lady with her Phantom Lover,"
2857,ACT I.,"Her Lindo Don Diego; Dona Sol,"
2858,ACT I.,"And Dona Serafina, and her cousins."
2859,ACT I.,
2860,ACT I.,Don C.  What was the play?
2861,ACT I.,
2862,ACT I.,Lara.  It was a dull affair;
2863,ACT I.,"One of those comedies in which you see,"
2864,ACT I.,"As Lope says, the history of the world"
2865,ACT I.,Brought down from Genesis to the Day of Judgment.
2866,ACT I.,"There were three duels fought in the first act,"
2867,ACT I.,"Three gentlemen receiving deadly wounds,"
2868,ACT I.,"Laying their hands upon their hearts, and saying,"
2869,ACT I.,"""O, I am dead!"" a lover in a closet,"
2870,ACT I.,"An old hidalgo, and a gay Don Juan,"
2871,ACT I.,"A Dona Inez with a black mantilla,"
2872,ACT I.,"Followed at twilight by an unknown lover,"
2873,ACT I.,Who looks intently where he knows she is not!
2874,ACT I.,
2875,ACT I.,"Don C.  Of course, the Preciosa danced to-night?"
2876,ACT I.,
2877,ACT I.,Lara.  And never better.  Every footstep fell
2878,ACT I.,As lightly as a sunbeam on the water.
2879,ACT I.,I think the girl extremely beautiful.
2880,ACT I.,
2881,ACT I.,Don C.  Almost beyond the privilege of woman!
2882,ACT I.,I saw her in the Prado yesterday.
2883,ACT I.,"Her step was royal,--queen-like,--and her face"
2884,ACT I.,As beautiful as a saint's in Paradise.
2885,ACT I.,
2886,ACT I.,"Lara.  May not a saint fall from her Paradise,"
2887,ACT I.,And be no more a saint?
2888,ACT I.,
2889,ACT I.,Don C.      Why do you ask?
2890,ACT I.,
2891,ACT I.,"Lara.  Because I have heard it said this angel fell,"
2892,ACT I.,"And though she is a virgin outwardly,"
2893,ACT I.,Within she is a sinner; like those panels
2894,ACT I.,Of doors and altar-pieces the old monks
2895,ACT I.,"Painted in convents, with the Virgin Mary"
2896,ACT I.,"On the outside, and on the inside Venus!"
2897,ACT I.,
2898,ACT I.,"Don C.  You do her wrong; indeed, you do her wrong!"
2899,ACT I.,She is as virtuous as she is fair.
2900,ACT I.,
2901,ACT I.,"Lara.  How credulous you are!  Why look you, friend,"
2902,ACT I.,"There's not a virtuous woman in Madrid,"
2903,ACT I.,In this whole city!  And would you persuade me
2904,ACT I.,"That a mere dancing-girl, who shows herself,"
2905,ACT I.,"Nightly, half naked, on the stage, for money,"
2906,ACT I.,And with voluptuous motions fires the blood
2907,ACT I.,"Of inconsiderate youth, is to be held"
2908,ACT I.,A model for her virtue?
2909,ACT I.,
2910,ACT I.,Don C.         You forget
2911,ACT I.,She is a Gypsy girl.
2912,ACT I.,
2913,ACT I.,Lara.        And therefore won
2914,ACT I.,The easier.
2915,ACT I.,
2916,ACT I.,"Don C.  Nay, not to be won at all!"
2917,ACT I.,The only virtue that a Gypsy prizes
2918,ACT I.,Is chastity.  That is her only virtue.
2919,ACT I.,Dearer than life she holds it.  I remember
2920,ACT I.,"A Gypsy woman, a vile, shameless bawd,"
2921,ACT I.,Whose craft was to betray the young and fair;
2922,ACT I.,And yet this woman was above all bribes.
2923,ACT I.,"And when a noble lord, touched by her beauty,"
2924,ACT I.,"The wild and wizard beauty of her race,"
2925,ACT I.,"Offered her gold to be what she made others,"
2926,ACT I.,"She turned upon him, with a look of scorn,"
2927,ACT I.,And smote him in the face!
2928,ACT I.,
2929,ACT I.,Lara.        And does that prove
2930,ACT I.,That Preciosa is above suspicion?
2931,ACT I.,
2932,ACT I.,Don C.  It proves a nobleman may be repulsed
2933,ACT I.,When he thinks conquest easy.  I believe
2934,ACT I.,"That woman, in her deepest degradation,"
2935,ACT I.,"Holds something sacred, something undefiled,"
2936,ACT I.,"Some pledge and keepsake of her higher nature,"
2937,ACT I.,"And, like the diamond in the dark, retains"
2938,ACT I.,Some quenchless gleam of the celestial light!
2939,ACT I.,
2940,ACT I.,Lara.  Yet Preciosa would have taken the gold.
2941,ACT I.,
2942,ACT I.,Don C.  (rising).  I do not think so.
2943,ACT I.,
2944,ACT I.,Lara.         I am sure of it.
2945,ACT I.,"But why this haste?  Stay yet a little longer,"
2946,ACT I.,And fight the battles of your Dulcinea.
2947,ACT I.,
2948,ACT I.,"Don C.  'T is late.  I must begone, for if I stay"
2949,ACT I.,You will not be persuaded.
2950,ACT I.,
2951,ACT I.,Lara.         Yes; persuade me.
2952,ACT I.,
2953,ACT I.,Don C.  No one so deaf as he who will not hear!
2954,ACT I.,
2955,ACT I.,Lara.  No one so blind as he who will not see!
2956,ACT I.,
2957,ACT I.,"Don C.  And so good night.  I wish you pleasant dreams,"
2958,ACT I.,And greater faith in woman.      [Exit.
2959,ACT I.,
2960,ACT I.,Lara.          Greater faith!
2961,ACT I.,I have the greatest faith; for I believe
2962,ACT I.,Victorian is her lover.  I believe
2963,ACT I.,That I shall be to-morrow; and thereafter
2964,ACT I.,"Another, and another, and another,"
2965,ACT I.,"Chasing each other through her zodiac,"
2966,ACT I.,As Taurus chases Aries.

2975,ACT I.,She is not to be purchased by your gold.
2976,ACT I.,
2977,ACT I.,Lara.  Then I will try some other way to win her.
2978,ACT I.,"Pray, dost thou know Victorian?"
2979,ACT I.,
2980,ACT I.,"Fran.          Yes, my lord;"
2981,ACT I.,I saw him at the jeweller's to-day.
2982,ACT I.,
2983,ACT I.,Lara.  What was he doing there?
2984,ACT I.,
2985,ACT I.,Fran.         I saw him buy
2986,ACT I.,"A golden ring, that had a ruby in it."
2987,ACT I.,
2988,ACT I.,Lara.  Was there another like it?
2989,ACT I.,
2990,ACT I.,Fran.          One so like it
2991,ACT I.,I could not choose between them.
2992,ACT I.,
2993,ACT I.,Lara.             It is well.
2994,ACT I.,To-morrow morning bring that ring to me.
2995,ACT I.,Do not forget. Now light me to my bed.

3011,ACT I.,"Mother, what does marry mean?  It means to spin, to bear"

3014,ACT I.,"musicians.)  And now, gentlemen, Pax vobiscum! as the ass said to"
3015,ACT I.,"the cabbages.  Pray, walk this way; and don't hang down your"
3016,ACT I.,heads. It is no disgrace to have an old father and a ragged
3017,ACT I.,"shirt.  Now, look you,  you are gentlemen who lead the life of"
3018,ACT I.,"crickets; you enjoy hunger by  day and noise by night.  Yet, I"
3019,ACT I.,"beseech you, for this once be not loud, but pathetic; for it is a"

3031,ACT I.,
3032,ACT I.,First Mus.  Why so?
3033,ACT I.,
3034,ACT I.,Chispa.  Because I have heard it said that Saturday is an

3224,SERENADE.,Vict.  Thou blessed angel!
3225,SERENADE.,
3226,SERENADE.,Prec.     And when thou wast gone
3227,SERENADE.,I felt an acting here.  I did not speak
3228,SERENADE.,To any one that day.  But from that day
3229,SERENADE.,Bartolome grew hateful unto me.

3231,SERENADE.,Vict.  Remember him no more.  Let not his shadow
3232,SERENADE.,Come between thee and me.  Sweet Preciosa!
3233,SERENADE.,"I loved thee even then, though I was silent!"
3234,SERENADE.,
3235,SERENADE.,Prec.  I thought I ne'er should see thy face again.
3236,SERENADE.,Thy farewell had a sound of sorrow in it.
3237,SERENADE.,
3238,SERENADE.,Vict.  That was the first sound in the song of love!
3239,SERENADE.,"Scarce more than silence is, and yet a sound."
3240,SERENADE.,Hands of invisible spirits touch the strings
3241,SERENADE.,"Of that mysterious instrument, the soul,"
3242,SERENADE.,And play the prelude of our fate.  We hear
3243,SERENADE.,"The voice prophetic, and are not alone."
3244,SERENADE.,
3245,SERENADE.,Prec.  That is my faith.  Dust thou believe these warnings?
3246,SERENADE.,
3247,SERENADE.,Vict.  So far as this.  Our feelings and our thoughts
3248,SERENADE.,"Tend ever on, and rest not in the Present."
3249,SERENADE.,"As drops of rain fall into some dark well,"
3250,SERENADE.,"And from below comes a scarce audible sound,"
3251,SERENADE.,"So fall our thoughts into the dark Hereafter,"
3252,SERENADE.,And their mysterious echo reaches us.
3253,SERENADE.,
3254,SERENADE.,"Prec.  I have felt it so, but found no words to say it!"
3255,SERENADE.,I cannot reason; I can only feel!
3256,SERENADE.,But thou hast language for all thoughts and feelings.
3257,SERENADE.,Thou art a scholar; and sometimes I think
3258,SERENADE.,We cannot walk together in this world!
3259,SERENADE.,The distance that divides us is too great!
3260,SERENADE.,Henceforth thy pathway lies among the stars;
3261,SERENADE.,I must not hold thee back.
3262,SERENADE.,
3263,SERENADE.,Vict.        Thou little sceptic!
3264,SERENADE.,Dost thou still doubt?  What I most prize in woman
3265,SERENADE.,"Is her affections, not her intellect!"
3266,SERENADE.,The intellect is finite; but the affections
3267,SERENADE.,"Are infinite, and cannot be exhausted."
3268,SERENADE.,Compare me with the great men of the earth;
3269,SERENADE.,"What am I?  Why, a pygmy among giants!"
3270,SERENADE.,"But if thou lovest,--mark me! I say lovest,"
3271,SERENADE.,The greatest of thy sex excels thee not!
3272,SERENADE.,"The world of the affections is thy world,"
3273,SERENADE.,Not that of man's ambition.  In that stillness
3274,SERENADE.,"Which most becomes a woman, calm and holy,"
3275,SERENADE.,"Thou sittest by the fireside of the heart,"
3276,SERENADE.,Feeding its flame.  The element of fire
3277,SERENADE.,"Is pure.  It cannot change nor hide its nature,"
3278,SERENADE.,But burns as brightly in a Gypsy camp
3279,SERENADE.,As in a palace hall.  Art thou convinced?
3280,SERENADE.,
3281,SERENADE.,"Prec.  Yes, that I love thee, as the good love heaven;"
3282,SERENADE.,But not that I am worthy of that heaven.
3283,SERENADE.,How shall I more deserve it?
3284,SERENADE.,
3285,SERENADE.,Vict.           Loving more.
3286,SERENADE.,
3287,SERENADE.,Prec.  I cannot love thee more; my heart is full.
3288,SERENADE.,
3289,SERENADE.,"Vict.  Then let it overflow, and I will drink it,"
3290,SERENADE.,As in the summer-time the thirsty sands
3291,SERENADE.,"Drink the swift waters of the Manzanares,"
3292,SERENADE.,And still do thirst for more.
3293,SERENADE.,
3294,SERENADE.,A  Watchman (in the street).  Ave Maria
3295,SERENADE.,Purissima!  'T is midnight and serene!
3296,SERENADE.,
3297,SERENADE.,Vict.  Hear'st thou that cry?
3298,SERENADE.,
3299,SERENADE.,"Prec.      It is a hateful sound,"
3300,SERENADE.,To scare thee from me!
3301,SERENADE.,
3302,SERENADE.,Vict.      As the hunter's horn
3303,SERENADE.,"Doth scare the timid stag, or bark of hounds"
3304,SERENADE.,The moor-fowl from his mate.
3305,SERENADE.,
3306,SERENADE.,"Prec.        Pray, do not go!"
3307,SERENADE.,
3308,SERENADE.,Vict.  I must away to Alcala to-night.
3309,SERENADE.,Think of me when I am away.
3310,SERENADE.,
3311,SERENADE.,Prec.            Fear not!
3312,SERENADE.,I have no thoughts that do not think of thee.
3313,SERENADE.,
3314,SERENADE.,Vict.  (giving her a ring).
3315,SERENADE.,"And to remind thee of my love, take this;"
3316,SERENADE.,"A serpent, emblem of Eternity;"
3317,SERENADE.,"A ruby,--say, a drop of my heart's blood."
3318,SERENADE.,
3319,SERENADE.,"Prec.  It is an ancient saying, that the ruby"
3320,SERENADE.,"Brings gladness to the wearer, and preserves"
3321,SERENADE.,"The heart pure, and, if laid beneath the pillow,"
3322,SERENADE.,"Drives away evil dreams.  But then, alas!"
3323,SERENADE.,It was a serpent tempted Eve to sin.
3324,SERENADE.,
3325,SERENADE.,Vict.  What convent of barefooted Carmelites
3326,SERENADE.,Taught thee so much theology?
3327,SERENADE.,
3328,SERENADE.,Prec. (laying her hand upon his mouth).  Hush! hush!
3329,SERENADE.,Good night! and may all holy angels guard thee!
3330,SERENADE.,
3331,SERENADE.,Vict.  Good night! good night!  Thou art my guardian angel!
3332,SERENADE.,I have no other saint than thou to pray to!
3333,SERENADE.,
3334,SERENADE.,(He descends by the balcony.)
3335,SERENADE.,
3336,SERENADE.,"Prec.  Take care, and do not hurt thee.  Art thou safe?"
3337,SERENADE.,
3338,SERENADE.,Vict.  (from the garden).
3339,SERENADE.,Safe as my love for thee!  But art thou safe?
3340,SERENADE.,Others can climb a balcony by moonlight
3341,SERENADE.,As well as I.  Pray shut thy window close;
3342,SERENADE.,I am jealous of the perfumed air of night
3343,SERENADE.,That from this garden climbs to kiss thy lips.
3344,SERENADE.,
3345,SERENADE.,Prec.  (throwing down her handkerchief).
3346,SERENADE.,Thou silly child!  Take this to blind thine eyes.
3347,SERENADE.,It is my benison!
3348,SERENADE.,
3349,SERENADE.,Vict.      And brings to me
3350,SERENADE.,"Sweet fragrance from thy lips, as the soft wind"
3351,SERENADE.,Wafts to the out-bound mariner the breath
3352,SERENADE.,Of the beloved land he leaves behind.
3353,SERENADE.,
3354,SERENADE.,Prec.  Make not thy voyage long.
3355,SERENADE.,
3356,SERENADE.,Vict.        To-morrow night
3357,SERENADE.,Shall see me safe returned.  Thou art the star
3358,SERENADE.,To guide me to an anchorage.  Good night!
3359,SERENADE.,"My beauteous star!  My star of love, good night!"
3360,SERENADE.,
3361,SERENADE.,Prec. Good night!
3362,SERENADE.,
3363,SERENADE.,Watchman (at a distance).  Ave Maria Purissima!

3367,SERENADE.,Scene IV. -- An inn on the road to Alcala.
3368,SERENADE.,BALTASAR asleep on a bench.  Enter CHISPA.
3369,SERENADE.,
3370,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  And here we are, halfway to Alcala, between cocks and"
3371,SERENADE.,"midnight.  Body o' me! what an inn this is!  The lights out, and"
3372,SERENADE.,the  landlord asleep.  Hola! ancient Baltasar!
3373,SERENADE.,
3374,SERENADE.,Bal. (waking).  Here I am.
3375,SERENADE.,
3376,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  Yes, there you are, like a one-eyed Alcalde in a town"
3377,SERENADE.,"without inhabitants.  Bring a light, and let me have supper."
3378,SERENADE.,
3379,SERENADE.,Bal.  Where is your master?
3380,SERENADE.,
3381,SERENADE.,Chispo.  Do not trouble yourself about him.  We have stopped a
3382,SERENADE.,"moment to breathe our horses; and, if he chooses to walk up and"
3383,SERENADE.,"down in the open air, looking into the sky as one who hears it"
3384,SERENADE.,"rain, that does not satisfy my hunger, you know.  But be quick,"
3385,SERENADE.,"for I am in a hurry, and every man stretches his legs according"
3386,SERENADE.,to the length of his coverlet.  What have we here?
3387,SERENADE.,
3388,SERENADE.,Bal. (setting a light on the table).  Stewed rabbit.
3389,SERENADE.,
3390,SERENADE.,"Chispa (eating).  Conscience of Portalegre! Stewed kitten, you"
3391,SERENADE.,mean!
3392,SERENADE.,
3393,SERENADE.,"Bal.  And a pitcher of Pedro Ximenes, with a roasted pear in"
3394,SERENADE.,it.
3395,SERENADE.,
3396,SERENADE.,"Chispa (drinking).  Ancient Baltasar, amigo!  You know how to"
3397,SERENADE.,cry wine and sell vinegar.  I tell you this is nothing but Vino
3398,SERENADE.,"Tinto of La Mancha, with a tang of the swine-skin."
3399,SERENADE.,
3400,SERENADE.,"Bal.  I swear to you by Saint Simon and Judas, it is all as I"
3401,SERENADE.,say.
3402,SERENADE.,
3403,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  And I swear to you by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, that"
3404,SERENADE.,"it is no such thing.  Moreover, your supper is like the hidalgo's"
3405,SERENADE.,"dinner, very little meat and a great deal of tablecloth."
3406,SERENADE.,
3407,SERENADE.,Bal.  Ha! ha! ha!
3408,SERENADE.,
3409,SERENADE.,Chispa. And more noise than nuts.
3410,SERENADE.,
3411,SERENADE.,"Bal.  Ha! ha! ha!  You must have your joke, Master Chispa.  But"
3412,SERENADE.,"shall I not ask Don Victorian in, to take a draught of the Pedro"
3413,SERENADE.,Ximenes?
3414,SERENADE.,
3415,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  No; you might as well say, ""Don't-you-want-some?"" to a"
3416,SERENADE.,dead man.
3417,SERENADE.,
3418,SERENADE.,Bal.  Why does he go so often to Madrid?
3419,SERENADE.,
3420,SERENADE.,Chispa.  For the same reason that he eats no supper.  He is in
3421,SERENADE.,"love.  Were you ever in love, Baltasar?"
3422,SERENADE.,
3423,SERENADE.,"Bal.  I was never out of it, good Chispa.  It has been the"
3424,SERENADE.,torment of my life.
3425,SERENADE.,
3426,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  What! are you on fire, too, old hay-stack?  Why, we"
3427,SERENADE.,shall never be able to put you out.
3428,SERENADE.,
3429,SERENADE.,Vict. (without).  Chispa!
3430,SERENADE.,
3431,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  Go to bed, Pero Grullo, for the cocks are crowing."
3432,SERENADE.,
3433,SERENADE.,Vict.  Ea! Chispa! Chispa!
3434,SERENADE.,
3435,SERENADE.,"Chispa.  Ea! Senor.  Come with me, ancient Baltasar, and bring"
3436,SERENADE.,water for the horses.  I will pay for the supper tomorrow.

3438,SERENADE.,
3439,SERENADE.,
3440,SERENADE.,
3441,SERENADE.,SCENE V. -- VICTORIAN'S chambers at  Alcala.  HYPOLITO asleep in
3442,SERENADE.,an arm-chair.  He awakes slowly.
3443,SERENADE.,
3444,SERENADE.,"Hyp.  I must have been asleep! ay, sound asleep!"
3445,SERENADE.,"And it was all a dream.  O sleep, sweet sleep"
3446,SERENADE.,"Whatever form thou takest, thou art fair,"
3447,SERENADE.,Holding unto our lips thy goblet filled
3448,SERENADE.,"Out of Oblivion's well, a healing draught!"
3449,SERENADE.,The candles have burned low; it must be late.
3450,SERENADE.,"Where can Victorian be?  Like Fray Carrillo,"
3451,SERENADE.,The only place in which one cannot find him
3452,SERENADE.,"Is his own cell.  Here's his guitar, that seldom"
3453,SERENADE.,Feels the caresses of its master's hand.
3454,SERENADE.,"Open thy silent lips, sweet instrument!"
3455,SERENADE.,And make dull midnight merry with a song.
3456,SERENADE.,
3457,SERENADE.,(He plays and sings.)
3458,SERENADE.,
3459,SERENADE.,Padre Francisco!
3460,SERENADE.,Padre Francisco!
3461,SERENADE.,What do you want of Padre Francisco?
3462,SERENADE.,Here is a pretty young maiden
3463,SERENADE.,Who wants to confess her sins!
3464,SERENADE.,"Open the door and let her come in,"
3465,SERENADE.,I will shrive her from every sin.
3466,SERENADE.,
3467,SERENADE.,(Enter VICTORIAN.)
3468,SERENADE.,
3469,SERENADE.,Vict.  Padre Hypolito!  Padre Hypolito!
3470,SERENADE.,
3471,SERENADE.,Hyp.  What do you want of Padre Hypolito?
3472,SERENADE.,
3473,SERENADE.,"Vict.  Come, shrive me straight; for, if love be a sin,"
3474,SERENADE.,I am the greatest sinner that doth live.
3475,SERENADE.,"I will confess the sweetest of all crimes,"
3476,SERENADE.,A maiden wooed and won.
3477,SERENADE.,
3478,SERENADE.,Hyp.        The same old tale
3479,SERENADE.,"Of the old woman in the chimney-corner,"
3480,SERENADE.,"Who, while the pot boils, says, ""Come here, my child;"
3481,SERENADE.,"I'll tell thee a story of my wedding-day."""
3482,SERENADE.,
3483,SERENADE.,"Vict.  Nay, listen, for my heart is full; so full"
3484,SERENADE.,That I must speak.
3485,SERENADE.,
3486,SERENADE.,Hyp.    Alas! that heart of thine
3487,SERENADE.,Is like a scene in the old play; the curtain
3488,SERENADE.,"Rises to solemn music, and lo! enter"
3489,SERENADE.,The eleven thousand virgins of Cologne!
3490,SERENADE.,
3491,SERENADE.,"Vict.  Nay, like the Sibyl's volumes, thou shouldst say;"
3492,SERENADE.,"Those that remained, after the six were burned,"
3493,SERENADE.,Being held more precious than the nine together.
3494,SERENADE.,But listen to my tale.  Dost thou remember
3495,SERENADE.,The Gypsy girl we saw at Cordova
3496,SERENADE.,Dance the Romalis in the market-place?
3497,SERENADE.,
3498,SERENADE.,Hyp.  Thou meanest Preciosa.
3499,SERENADE.,
3500,SERENADE.,"Vict.          Ay, the same."
3501,SERENADE.,Thou knowest how her image haunted me
3502,SERENADE.,Long after we returned to Alcala.
3503,SERENADE.,She's in Madrid.
3504,SERENADE.,
3505,SERENADE.,Hyp.      I know it.
3506,SERENADE.,
3507,SERENADE.,Vict.         And I'm in love.
3508,SERENADE.,
3509,SERENADE.,Hyp.  And therefore in Madrid when thou shouldst be
3510,SERENADE.,In Alcala.
3511,SERENADE.,
3512,SERENADE.,"Vict.  O pardon me, my friend,"
3513,SERENADE.,If I so long have kept this secret from thee;
3514,SERENADE.,"But silence is the charm that guards such treasures,"
3515,SERENADE.,"And, if a word be spoken ere the time,"
3516,SERENADE.,"They sink again, they were not meant for us."
3517,SERENADE.,
3518,SERENADE.,Hyp.  Alas! alas!  I see thou art in love.
3519,SERENADE.,Love keeps the cold out better than a cloak.
3520,SERENADE.,It serves for food and raiment.  Give a Spaniard
3521,SERENADE.,"His mass, his olla, and his Dona Luisa--"
3522,SERENADE.,"Thou knowest the proverb.  But pray tell me, lover,"
3523,SERENADE.,How speeds thy wooing?  Is the maiden coy?
3524,SERENADE.,"Write her a song, beginning with an Ave;"
3525,SERENADE.,"Sing as the monk sang to the Virgin Mary,"
3526,SERENADE.,
3527,SERENADE.,Ave! cujus calcem clare
3528,SERENADE.,Nec centenni commendare
3529,SERENADE.,Sciret Seraph studio!
3530,SERENADE.,
3531,SERENADE.,"Vict.  Pray, do not jest!  This is no time for it!"
3532,SERENADE.,I am in earnest!
3533,SERENADE.,
3534,SERENADE.,Hyp.         Seriously enamored?
3535,SERENADE.,"What, ho!  The Primus of great Alcala"
3536,SERENADE.,"Enamored of a Gypsy?  Tell me frankly,"
3537,SERENADE.,How meanest thou?
3538,SERENADE.,
3539,SERENADE.,Vict.       I mean it honestly.
3540,SERENADE.,
3541,SERENADE.,Hyp.  Surely thou wilt not marry her!
3542,SERENADE.,
3543,SERENADE.,Vict.             Why not?
3544,SERENADE.,
3545,SERENADE.,"Hyp.  She was betrothed to one Bartolome,"
3546,SERENADE.,"If I remember rightly, a young Gypsy"
3547,SERENADE.,Who danced with her at Cordova.
3548,SERENADE.,
3549,SERENADE.,"Vict.      They quarrelled,"
3550,SERENADE.,And so the matter ended.
3551,SERENADE.,
3552,SERENADE.,Hyp.            But in truth
3553,SERENADE.,Thou wilt not marry her.
3554,SERENADE.,
3555,SERENADE.,Vict.         In truth I will.
3556,SERENADE.,The angels sang in heaven when she was born!
3557,SERENADE.,She is a precious jewel I have found
3558,SERENADE.,Among the filth and rubbish of the world.
3559,SERENADE.,"I'll stoop for it; but when I wear it here,"
3560,SERENADE.,"Set on my forehead like the morning star,"
3561,SERENADE.,"The world may wonder, but it will not laugh."
3562,SERENADE.,
3563,SERENADE.,"Hyp.  If thou wear'st nothing else upon thy forehead,"
3564,SERENADE.,'T will be indeed a wonder.
3565,SERENADE.,
3566,SERENADE.,Vict.          Out upon thee
3567,SERENADE.,"With thy unseasonable jests!  Pray tell me,"
3568,SERENADE.,Is there no virtue in the world?
3569,SERENADE.,
3570,SERENADE.,Hyp.            Not much.
3571,SERENADE.,"What, think'st thou, is she doing at this moment;"
3572,SERENADE.,"Now, while we speak of her?"
3573,SERENADE.,
3574,SERENADE.,"Vict.         She lies asleep,"
3575,SERENADE.,And from her parted lips her gentle breath
3576,SERENADE.,Comes like the fragrance from the lips of flowers.
3577,SERENADE.,"Her tender limbs are still, and on her breast"
3578,SERENADE.,"The cross she prayed to, ere she fell asleep,"
3579,SERENADE.,"Rises and falls with the soft tide of dreams,"
3580,SERENADE.,Like a light barge safe moored.
3581,SERENADE.,
3582,SERENADE.,"Hyp.     Which means, in prose,"
3583,SERENADE.,She's sleeping with her mouth a little open!
3584,SERENADE.,
3585,SERENADE.,"Vict.  O, would I had the old magician's glass"
3586,SERENADE.,To see her as she lies in childlike sleep!
3587,SERENADE.,
3588,SERENADE.,Hyp.  And wouldst thou venture?
3589,SERENADE.,
3590,SERENADE.,"Vict.      Ay, indeed I would!"
3591,SERENADE.,
3592,SERENADE.,Hyp.  Thou art courageous.  Hast thou e'er reflected
3593,SERENADE.,"How much lies hidden in that one word, NOW?"
3594,SERENADE.,
3595,SERENADE.,Vict.  Yes; all the awful mystery of Life!
3596,SERENADE.,"I oft have thought, my dear Hypolito,"
3597,SERENADE.,"That could we, by some spell of magic, change"
3598,SERENADE.,"The world and its inhabitants to stone,"
3599,SERENADE.,"In the same attitudes they now are in,"
3600,SERENADE.,What fearful glances downward might we cast
3601,SERENADE.,Into the hollow chasms of human life!
3602,SERENADE.,"What groups should we behold about the death-bed,"
3603,SERENADE.,Putting to shame the group of Niobe!
3604,SERENADE.,"What joyful welcomes, and what sad farewells!"
3605,SERENADE.,What stony tears in those congealed eyes!
3606,SERENADE.,What visible joy or anguish in those cheeks!
3607,SERENADE.,"What bridal pomps, and what funereal shows!"
3608,SERENADE.,"What foes, like gladiators, fierce and struggling!"
3609,SERENADE.,What lovers with their marble lips together!
3610,SERENADE.,
3611,SERENADE.,"Hyp.  Ay, there it is! and, if I were in love,"
3612,SERENADE.,That is the very point I most should dread.
3613,SERENADE.,"This magic glass, these magic spells of thine,"
3614,SERENADE.,Might tell a tale were better left untold.
3615,SERENADE.,"For instance, they might show us thy fair cousin,"
3616,SERENADE.,"The Lady Violante, bathed in tears"
3617,SERENADE.,"Of love and anger, like the maid of Colchis,"
3618,SERENADE.,"Whom thou, another faithless Argonaut,"
3619,SERENADE.,"Having won that golden fleece, a woman's love,"
3620,SERENADE.,Desertest for this Glauce.
3621,SERENADE.,
3622,SERENADE.,Vict.          Hold thy peace!
3623,SERENADE.,"She cares not for me.  She may wed another,"
3624,SERENADE.,"Or go into a convent, and, thus dying,"
3625,SERENADE.,Marry Achilles in the Elysian Fields.
3626,SERENADE.,
3627,SERENADE.,"Hyp. (rising).  And so, good night!  Good morning, I should say."
3628,SERENADE.,
3629,SERENADE.,(Clock strikes three.)
3630,SERENADE.,
3631,SERENADE.,Hark! how the loud and ponderous mace of Time
3632,SERENADE.,Knocks at the golden portals of the day!
3633,SERENADE.,"And so, once more, good night!  We'll speak more largely"
3634,SERENADE.,Of Preciosa when we meet again.
3635,SERENADE.,"Get thee to bed, and the magician, Sleep,"
3636,SERENADE.,"Shall show her to thee, in his magic glass,"
3637,SERENADE.,In all her loveliness.  Good night!
3638,SERENADE.,[Exit.
3639,SERENADE.,
3640,SERENADE.,Vict.         Good night!
3641,SERENADE.,But not to bed; for I must read awhile.
3642,SERENADE.,
3643,SERENADE.,"(Throws himself into the arm-chair which HYPOLITO has left, and"
3644,SERENADE.,lays a large book open upon his knees.)
3645,SERENADE.,
3646,SERENADE.,"Must read, or sit in revery and watch"
3647,SERENADE.,The changing color of the waves that break
3648,SERENADE.,Upon the idle sea-shore of the mind!
3649,SERENADE.,"Visions of Fame! that once did visit me,"
3650,SERENADE.,"Making night glorious with your smile, where are ye?"
3651,SERENADE.,"O, who shall give me, now that ye are gone,"
3652,SERENADE.,Juices of those immortal plants that bloom
3653,SERENADE.,"Upon Olympus, making us immortal?"
3654,SERENADE.,Or teach me where that wondrous mandrake grows
3655,SERENADE.,"Whose magic root, torn from the earth with groans,"
3656,SERENADE.,"At midnight hour, can scare the fiends away,"
3657,SERENADE.,And make the mind prolific in its fancies!
3658,SERENADE.,"I have the wish, but want the will, to act!"
3659,SERENADE.,Souls of great men departed!  Ye whose words
3660,SERENADE.,"Have come to light from the swift river of Time,"
3661,SERENADE.,"Like Roman swords found in the Tagus' bed,"
3662,SERENADE.,Where is the strength to wield the arms ye bore?
3663,SERENADE.,From the barred visor of Antiquity
3664,SERENADE.,"Reflected shines the eternal light of Truth,"
3665,SERENADE.,As from a mirror!  All the means of action--
3666,SERENADE.,"The shapeless masses, the materials--"
3667,SERENADE.,Lie everywhere about us.  What we need
3668,SERENADE.,Is the celestial fire to change the flint
3669,SERENADE.,"Into transparent crystal, bright and clear."
3670,SERENADE.,That fire is genius!  The rude peasant sits
3671,SERENADE.,"At evening in his smoky cot, and draws"
3672,SERENADE.,With charcoal uncouth figures on the wall.
3673,SERENADE.,"The son of genius comes, foot-sore with travel,"
3674,SERENADE.,And begs a shelter from the inclement night.
3675,SERENADE.,"He takes the charcoal from the peasant's hand,"
3676,SERENADE.,"And, by the magic of his touch at once"
3677,SERENADE.,"Transfigured, all its hidden virtues shine,"
3678,SERENADE.,"And, in the eyes of the astonished clown,"
3679,SERENADE.,"It gleams a diamond!  Even thus transformed,"
3680,SERENADE.,Rude popular traditions and old tales
3681,SERENADE.,"Shine as immortal poems, at the touch"
3682,SERENADE.,"Of some poor, houseless, homeless, wandering bard,"
3683,SERENADE.,Who had but a night's lodging for his pains.
3684,SERENADE.,"But there are brighter dreams than those of Fame,"
3685,SERENADE.,Which are the dreams of Love!  Out of the heart
3686,SERENADE.,"Rises the bright ideal of these dreams,"
3687,SERENADE.,As from some woodland fount a spirit rises
3688,SERENADE.,"And sinks again into its silent deeps,"
3689,SERENADE.,Ere the enamored knight can touch her robe!
3690,SERENADE.,"'T is this ideal that the soul of man,"
3691,SERENADE.,"Like the enamored knight beside the fountain,"
3692,SERENADE.,Waits for upon the margin of Life's stream;
3693,SERENADE.,"Waits to behold her rise from the dark waters,"
3694,SERENADE.,Clad in a mortal shape!  Alas! how many
3695,SERENADE.,"Must wait in vain!  The stream flows evermore,"
3696,SERENADE.,But from its silent deeps no spirit rises!
3697,SERENADE.,"Yet I, born under a propitious star,"
3698,SERENADE.,Have found the bright ideal of my dreams.
3699,SERENADE.,"Yes! she is ever with me.  I can feel,"
3700,SERENADE.,"Here, as I sit at midnight and alone,"
3701,SERENADE.,Her gentle breathing! on my breast can feel
3702,SERENADE.,The pressure of her head!  God's benison
3703,SERENADE.,"Rest ever on it!  Close those beauteous eyes,"
3704,SERENADE.,Sweet Sleep! and all the flowers that bloom at night
3705,SERENADE.,With balmy lips breathe in her ears my name!
3706,SERENADE.,

3712,ACT II.,
3713,ACT II.,SCENE I. -- PRECIOSA'S chamber.  Morning.  PRECIOSA and ANGELICA.
3714,ACT II.,
3715,ACT II.,Prec.  Why will you go so soon?  Stay yet awhile.
3716,ACT II.,The poor too often turn away unheard
3717,ACT II.,From hearts that shut against them with a sound
3718,ACT II.,"That will be heard in heaven.  Pray, tell me more"
3719,ACT II.,Of your adversities.  Keep nothing from me.
3720,ACT II.,What is your landlord's name?
3721,ACT II.,
3722,ACT II.,Ang.        The Count of Lara.
3723,ACT II.,
3724,ACT II.,"Prec.  The Count of Lara?  O, beware that man!"
3725,ACT II.,"Mistrust his pity,--hold no parley with him!"
3726,ACT II.,And rather die an outcast in the streets
3727,ACT II.,Than touch his gold.
3728,ACT II.,
3729,ACT II.,"Ang.      You know him, then!"
3730,ACT II.,
3731,ACT II.,Prec.              As much
3732,ACT II.,"As any woman may, and yet be pure."
3733,ACT II.,"As you would keep your name without a blemish,"
3734,ACT II.,Beware of him!
3735,ACT II.,
3736,ACT II.,Ang.      Alas! what can I do?
3737,ACT II.,"I cannot choose my friends.  Each word of kindness,"
3738,ACT II.,"Come whence it may, is welcome to the poor."
3739,ACT II.,
3740,ACT II.,Prec.  Make me your friend.  A girl so young and fair
3741,ACT II.,Should have no friends but those of her own sex.
3742,ACT II.,What is your name?
3743,ACT II.,
3744,ACT II.,Ang.        Angelica.
3745,ACT II.,
3746,ACT II.,Prec.            That name
3747,ACT II.,"Was given you, that you might be an angel"
3748,ACT II.,To her who bore you!  When your infant smile
3749,ACT II.,"Made her home Paradise, you were her angel."
3750,ACT II.,"O, be an angel still!  She needs that smile."
3751,ACT II.,"So long as you are innocent, fear nothing."
3752,ACT II.,"No one can harm you!  I am a poor girl,"
3753,ACT II.,Whom chance has taken from the public streets.
3754,ACT II.,I have no other shield than mine own virtue.
3755,ACT II.,That is the charm which has protected me!
3756,ACT II.,"Amid a thousand perils, I have worn it"
3757,ACT II.,Here on my heart!  It is my guardian angel.
3758,ACT II.,
3759,ACT II.,"Ang. (rising).  I thank you for this counsel, dearest lady."
3760,ACT II.,
3761,ACT II.,Prec.  Thank me by following it.
3762,ACT II.,
3763,ACT II.,Ang.           Indeed I will.
3764,ACT II.,
3765,ACT II.,"Prec.  Pray, do not go.  I have much more to say."
3766,ACT II.,
3767,ACT II.,Ang.  My mother is alone.  I dare not leave her.
3768,ACT II.,
3769,ACT II.,"Prec.  Some other time, then, when we meet again."
3770,ACT II.,You must not go away with words alone.
3771,ACT II.,
3772,ACT II.,(Gives her a purse.)
3773,ACT II.,
3774,ACT II.,Take this.  Would it were more.
3775,ACT II.,
3776,ACT II.,"Ang.        I thank you, lady."
3777,ACT II.,
3778,ACT II.,Prec.  No thanks.  To-morrow come to me again.
3779,ACT II.,"I dance to-night,--perhaps for the last time."
3780,ACT II.,"But what I gain, I promise shall be yours,"
3781,ACT II.,If that can save you from the Count of Lara.
3782,ACT II.,
3783,ACT II.,"Ang.  O, my dear lady! how shall I be grateful"
3784,ACT II.,For so much kindness?
3785,ACT II.,
3786,ACT II.,"Prec.      I  deserve no thanks,"
3787,ACT II.,"Thank Heaven, not me."
3788,ACT II.,
3789,ACT II.,Ang.        Both Heaven and you.
3790,ACT II.,
3791,ACT II.,Prec.             Farewell.
3792,ACT II.,Remember that you come again tomorrow.
3793,ACT II.,
3794,ACT II.,"Ang.  I will.  And may the Blessed Virgin guard you,"
3795,ACT II.,And all good angels.    [Exit.
3796,ACT II.,
3797,ACT II.,"Prec.    May they guard thee too,"
3798,ACT II.,And all the poor; for they have need of angels.
3799,ACT II.,"Now  bring me, dear Dolores, my basquina,"
3800,ACT II.,"My richest maja dress,--my dancing dress,"
3801,ACT II.,And my most precious jewels!  Make me look
3802,ACT II.,Fairer than night e'er saw me!  I've a prize
3803,ACT II.,"To win this day, worthy of Preciosa!"
3804,ACT II.,
3805,ACT II.,(Enter BELTRAN CRUZADO.)
3806,ACT II.,
3807,ACT II.,Cruz.  Ave Maria!
3808,ACT II.,
3809,ACT II.,Prec.       O God! my evil genius!
3810,ACT II.,What seekest thou here to-day?
3811,ACT II.,
3812,ACT II.,"Cruz.       Thyself,--my child."
3813,ACT II.,
3814,ACT II.,Prec.  What is thy will with me?
3815,ACT II.,
3816,ACT II.,Cruz.           Gold! gold!
3817,ACT II.,
3818,ACT II.,Prec.  I gave thee yesterday; I have no more.
3819,ACT II.,
3820,ACT II.,"Cruz.  The gold of the Busne,--give me his gold!"
3821,ACT II.,
3822,ACT II.,Prec.  I gave the last in charity to-day.
3823,ACT II.,
3824,ACT II.,Cruz.  That is a foolish lie.
3825,ACT II.,
3826,ACT II.,Prec.          It is the truth.
3827,ACT II.,
3828,ACT II.,Cruz.  Curses upon thee!  Thou art not my child!
3829,ACT II.,"Hast thou given gold away, and not to me?"
3830,ACT II.,"Not to thy father?  To whom, then?"
3831,ACT II.,
3832,ACT II.,Prec.               To one
3833,ACT II.,Who needs it more.
3834,ACT II.,
3835,ACT II.,Cruz.  No one can need it more.
3836,ACT II.,
3837,ACT II.,Prec.  Thou art not poor.
3838,ACT II.,
3839,ACT II.,"Cruz.  What, I, who lurk about"
3840,ACT II.,In dismal suburbs and unwholesome lanes
3841,ACT II.,"I, who am housed worse than the galley slave;"
3842,ACT II.,"I, who am fed worse than the kennelled hound;"
3843,ACT II.,"I, who am clothed in rags,--Beltran Cruzado,--"
3844,ACT II.,Not poor!
3845,ACT II.,
3846,ACT II.,Prec. Thou hast a stout heart and strong hands.
3847,ACT II.,Thou canst supply thy wants; what wouldst thou more?
3848,ACT II.,
3849,ACT II.,Cruz.  The gold of the Busne! give me his gold!
3850,ACT II.,
3851,ACT II.,Prec.  Beltran Cruzado! hear me once for all.
3852,ACT II.,"I speak the truth.  So long as I had gold,"
3853,ACT II.,"I gave it to thee freely, at all times,"
3854,ACT II.,Never denied thee; never had a wish
3855,ACT II.,But to fulfil thine own.  Now go in peace!
3856,ACT II.,"Be merciful, be patient, and ere long"
3857,ACT II.,Thou shalt have more.
3858,ACT II.,
3859,ACT II.,"Cruz.    And if I have it not,"
3860,ACT II.,"Thou shalt no longer dwell here in rich chambers,"
3861,ACT II.,"Wear silken dresses, feed on dainty food,"
3862,ACT II.,"And live in idleness; but go with me,"
3863,ACT II.,"Dance the Romalis in the public streets,"
3864,ACT II.,And wander wild again o'er field and fell;
3865,ACT II.,For here we stay not long.
3866,ACT II.,
3867,ACT II.,Prec.     What! march again?
3868,ACT II.,
3869,ACT II.,"Cruz.  Ay, with all speed. I hate the crowded town!"
3870,ACT II.,I cannot breathe shut up within its gates
3871,ACT II.,"Air,--I want air, and sunshine, and blue sky,"
3872,ACT II.,"The feeling of the breeze upon my face,"
3873,ACT II.,"The feeling of the turf beneath my feet,"
3874,ACT II.,And no walls but the far-off mountain-tops.
3875,ACT II.,"Then I am free and strong,--once more myself,"
3876,ACT II.,"Beltran Cruzado, Count of the Cales!"
3877,ACT II.,
3878,ACT II.,Prec.   God speed thee on thy march!--I cannot go.
3879,ACT II.,
3880,ACT II.,"Cruz.  Remember who I am, and who thou art"
3881,ACT II.,Be silent and obey! Yet one thing more.
3882,ACT II.,Bartolome Roman--
3883,ACT II.,
3884,ACT II.,"Prec. (with emotion).  O, I beseech thee"
3885,ACT II.,"If my obedience and blameless life,"
3886,ACT II.,If my humility and meek submission
3887,ACT II.,"In all things hitherto, can move in thee"
3888,ACT II.,One feeling of compassion; if thou art
3889,ACT II.,"Indeed my father, and canst trace in me"
3890,ACT II.,"One look of her who bore me, or one tone"
3891,ACT II.,"That doth remind thee of her, let it plead"
3892,ACT II.,"In my behalf, who am a feeble girl,"
3893,ACT II.,"Too feeble to resist, and do not force me"
3894,ACT II.,To wed that man!  I am afraid of him!
3895,ACT II.,I do not love him! On my knees I beg thee
3896,ACT II.,"To use no violence, nor do in haste"
3897,ACT II.,What cannot be undone!
3898,ACT II.,
3899,ACT II.,"Cruz.    O child, child, child!"
3900,ACT II.,"Thou hast betrayed thy secret, as a bird"
3901,ACT II.,"Betrays her nest, by striving to conceal it."
3902,ACT II.,I will not leave thee here in the great city
3903,ACT II.,To be a grandee's mistress.  Make thee ready
3904,ACT II.,To go with us; and until then remember
3905,ACT II.,A watchful eye is on thee.    [Exit.
3906,ACT II.,
3907,ACT II.,Prec.          Woe is me!
3908,ACT II.,I have a strange misgiving in my heart!
3909,ACT II.,"But that one deed of charity I'll do,"
3910,ACT II.,Befall what may; they cannot take that from me.
3911,ACT II.,
3912,ACT II.,
3913,ACT II.,
3914,ACT II.,SCENE II --  A room in the ARCHBISHOP'S Palace. The ARCHBISHOP
3915,ACT II.,and a CARDINAL seated.
3916,ACT II.,
3917,ACT II.,"Arch.  Knowing how near it touched the public morals,"
3918,ACT II.,And that our age is grown corrupt and rotten
3919,ACT II.,"By such excesses, we have sent to Rome,"
3920,ACT II.,Beseeching that his Holiness would aid
3921,ACT II.,"In curing the gross surfeit of the time,"
3922,ACT II.,By seasonable stop put here in Spain
3923,ACT II.,To bull-fights and lewd dances on the stage.
3924,ACT II.,All this you know.
3925,ACT II.,
3926,ACT II.,Card.      Know and approve.
3927,ACT II.,
3928,ACT II.,"Arch.          And further,"
3929,ACT II.,"That, by a mandate from his Holiness,"
3930,ACT II.,The first have been suppressed.
3931,ACT II.,
3932,ACT II.,Card.         I trust forever.
3933,ACT II.,It was a cruel sport.
3934,ACT II.,
3935,ACT II.,"Arch.     A barbarous pastime,"
3936,ACT II.,Disgraceful to the land that calls itself
3937,ACT II.,Most Catholic and Christian.
3938,ACT II.,
3939,ACT II.,Card.         Yet the people
3940,ACT II.,"Murmur at this; and, if the public dances"
3941,ACT II.,"Should be condemned upon too slight occasion,"
3942,ACT II.,Worse ills might follow than the ills we cure.
3943,ACT II.,As Panem et Circenses was the cry
3944,ACT II.,"Among the Roman populace of old,"
3945,ACT II.,So Pan y Toros is the cry in Spain.
3946,ACT II.,Hence I would act advisedly herein;
3947,ACT II.,And therefore have induced your Grace to see
3948,ACT II.,"These national dances, ere we interdict them."
3949,ACT II.,
3950,ACT II.,(Enter a Servant)
3951,ACT II.,
3952,ACT II.,"Serv.  The dancing-girl, and with her the musicians"
3953,ACT II.,"Your Grace was pleased to order, wait without."
3954,ACT II.,
3955,ACT II.,Arch.  Bid them come in.  Now shall your eyes behold
3956,ACT II.,"In what angelic, yet voluptuous shape"
3957,ACT II.,The Devil came to tempt Saint Anthony.
3958,ACT II.,
3959,ACT II.,"(Enter PRECIOSA, with a mantle thrown over her head.  She"
3960,ACT II.,"advances slowly, in modest, half-timid attitude.)"
3961,ACT II.,
3962,ACT II.,"Card. (aside).  O, what a fair and ministering angel"
3963,ACT II.,Was lost to heaven when this sweet woman fell!
3964,ACT II.,
3965,ACT II.,Prec. (kneeling before the ARCHBISHOP).
3966,ACT II.,I have obeyed the order of your Grace.
3967,ACT II.,"If I intrude upon your better hours,"
3968,ACT II.,"I proffer this excuse, and here beseech"
3969,ACT II.,Your holy benediction.
3970,ACT II.,
3971,ACT II.,"Arch.      May God bless thee,"
3972,ACT II.,And lead thee to a better life.  Arise.
3973,ACT II.,
3974,ACT II.,"Card. (aside).  Her acts are modest, and her words discreet!"
3975,ACT II.,"I did not look for this!  Come hither, child."
3976,ACT II.,Is thy name Preciosa?
3977,ACT II.,
3978,ACT II.,Prec.       Thus I am called.
3979,ACT II.,
3980,ACT II.,Card.  That is a Gypsy name.  Who is thy father?
3981,ACT II.,
3982,ACT II.,"Prec.  Beltran Cruzado, Count of the Cales."
3983,ACT II.,
3984,ACT II.,Arch.  I have a dim remembrance of that man:
3985,ACT II.,"He was a bold and reckless character,"
3986,ACT II.,A sun-burnt Ishmael!
3987,ACT II.,
3988,ACT II.,Card.      Dost thou remember
3989,ACT II.,Thy earlier days?
3990,ACT II.,
3991,ACT II.,Prec.  Yes; by the Darro's side
3992,ACT II.,My childhood passed.  I can remember still
3993,ACT II.,"The river, and the mountains capped with snow"
3994,ACT II.,"The village, where, yet a little child,"
3995,ACT II.,I told the traveller's fortune in the street;
3996,ACT II.,"The smuggler's horse, the brigand and the shepherd;"
3997,ACT II.,The march across the moor; the halt at noon;
3998,ACT II.,"The red fire of the evening camp, that lighted"
3999,ACT II.,"The forest where we slept; and, further back,"
4000,ACT II.,"As in a dream or in some former life,"
4001,ACT II.,Gardens and palace walls.
4002,ACT II.,
4003,ACT II.,"Arch.      'T is the Alhambra,"
4004,ACT II.,Under whose towers the Gypsy camp was pitched.
4005,ACT II.,But the time wears; and we would see thee dance.
4006,ACT II.,
4007,ACT II.,Prec.  Your Grace shall be obeyed.
4008,ACT II.,
4009,ACT II.,(She lays aside her mantilla.  The music of the cachucha is
4010,ACT II.,"played, and the dance begins.  The ARCHBISHOP and the CARDINAL"
4011,ACT II.,look on with gravity and an occasional frown; then make signs to
4012,ACT II.,"each other; and, as the dance continues, become more and more"
4013,ACT II.,"pleased and excited; and at length rise from their seats, throw"
4014,ACT II.,"their caps in the air, and applaud vehemently as the scene"
4015,ACT II.,closes.)
4016,ACT II.,
4017,ACT II.,
4018,ACT II.,
4019,ACT II.,SCENE III. -- The Prado.  A long avenue of trees leading to the
4020,ACT II.,gate of Atocha.  On the right the dome and spires of a convent.
4021,ACT II.,"A fountain. Evening, DON CARLOS and HYPOLITO meeting."
4022,ACT II.,
4023,ACT II.,"Don C.  Hola! good evening, Don Hypolito."
4024,ACT II.,
4025,ACT II.,"Hyp.  And a good evening to my friend, Don Carlos."
4026,ACT II.,Some lucky star has led my steps this way.
4027,ACT II.,I was in search of you.
4028,ACT II.,
4029,ACT II.,Don. C.     Command me always.
4030,ACT II.,
4031,ACT II.,"Hyp. Do you remember, in Quevedo's Dreams,"
4032,ACT II.,"The miser, who, upon the Day of Judgment,"
4033,ACT II.,Asks if his money-bags would rise?
4034,ACT II.,
4035,ACT II.,Don C.              I do;
4036,ACT II.,But what of that?
4037,ACT II.,
4038,ACT II.,Hyp.  I am that wretched man.
4039,ACT II.,
4040,ACT II.,Don C.  You mean to tell me yours have risen empty?
4041,ACT II.,
4042,ACT II.,Hyp.  And amen! said my Cid the Campeador.
4043,ACT II.,
4044,ACT II.,"Don C.  Pray, how much need you?"
4045,ACT II.,
4046,ACT II.,"Hyp.       Some half-dozen ounces,"
4047,ACT II.,"Which, with due interest--"
4048,ACT II.,
4049,ACT II.,"Don C. (giving his purse).  What, am I a Jew"
4050,ACT II.,To put my moneys out at usury?
4051,ACT II.,Here is my purse.
4052,ACT II.,
4053,ACT II.,Hyp.  Thank you.  A pretty purse.
4054,ACT II.,Made by the hand of some fair Madrilena;
4055,ACT II.,Perhaps a keepsake.
4056,ACT II.,
4057,ACT II.,"Don C.  No, 't is at your service."
4058,ACT II.,
4059,ACT II.,"Hyp.  Thank you again.  Lie there, good Chrysostom,"
4060,ACT II.,"And with thy golden mouth remind me often,"
4061,ACT II.,I am the debtor of my friend.
4062,ACT II.,
4063,ACT II.,"Don C.         But tell me,"
4064,ACT II.,Come you to-day from Alcala?
4065,ACT II.,
4066,ACT II.,Hyp.           This moment.
4067,ACT II.,
4068,ACT II.,"Don C.  And pray, how fares the brave Victorian?"
4069,ACT II.,
4070,ACT II.,"Hyp.  Indifferent well; that is to say, not well."
4071,ACT II.,A damsel has ensnared him with the glances
4072,ACT II.,"Of her dark, roving eyes, as herdsmen catch"
4073,ACT II.,A steer of Andalusia with a lazo.
4074,ACT II.,He is in love.
4075,ACT II.,
4076,ACT II.,Don C.  And is it faring ill
4077,ACT II.,To be in love?
4078,ACT II.,
4079,ACT II.,Hyp.     In his case very ill.
4080,ACT II.,
4081,ACT II.,Don C.  Why so?
4082,ACT II.,
4083,ACT II.,"Hyp.  For many reasons.  First and foremost,"
4084,ACT II.,Because he is in love with an ideal;
4085,ACT II.,A creature of his own imagination;
4086,ACT II.,A child of air; an echo of his heart;
4087,ACT II.,"And, like a lily on a river floating,"
4088,ACT II.,She floats upon the river of his thoughts!
4089,ACT II.,
4090,ACT II.,Don C.  A common thing with poets.  But who is
4091,ACT II.,"This floating lily?  For, in fine, some woman,"
4092,ACT II.,"Some living woman,--not a mere ideal,--"
4093,ACT II.,Must wear the outward semblance of his thought.
4094,ACT II.,Who is it?  Tell me.
4095,ACT II.,
4096,ACT II.,"Hyp.       Well, it is a woman!"
4097,ACT II.,"But, look you, from the coffer of his heart"
4098,ACT II.,"He brings forth precious jewels to adorn her,"
4099,ACT II.,As pious priests adorn some favorite saint
4100,ACT II.,"With gems and gold, until at length she gleams"
4101,ACT II.,"One blaze of glory.  Without these, you know,"
4102,ACT II.,"And the priest's benediction, 't is a doll."
4103,ACT II.,
4104,ACT II.,"Don C.  Well, well! who is this doll?"
4105,ACT II.,
4106,ACT II.,"Hyp.       Why, who do you think?"
4107,ACT II.,
4108,ACT II.,Don C.  His cousin Violante.
4109,ACT II.,
4110,ACT II.,Hyp.           Guess again.
4111,ACT II.,"To ease his laboring heart, in the last storm"
4112,ACT II.,"He threw her overboard, with all her ingots."
4113,ACT II.,
4114,ACT II.,Don C.  I cannot guess; so tell me who it is.
4115,ACT II.,
4116,ACT II.,Hyp.  Not I.
4117,ACT II.,
4118,ACT II.,Don. C.   Why not?
4119,ACT II.,
4120,ACT II.,Hyp. (mysteriously).  Why?  Because Mari Franca
4121,ACT II.,Was married four leagues out of Salamanca!
4122,ACT II.,
4123,ACT II.,"Don C.  Jesting aside, who is it?"
4124,ACT II.,
4125,ACT II.,Hyp.                 Preciosa.
4126,ACT II.,
4127,ACT II.,Don C.  Impossible!  The Count of Lara tells me
4128,ACT II.,She is not virtuous.
4129,ACT II.,
4130,ACT II.,Hyp.       Did I say she was?
4131,ACT II.,The Roman Emperor Claudius had a wife
4132,ACT II.,"Whose name was Messalina, as I think;"
4133,ACT II.,Valeria Messalina was her name.
4134,ACT II.,"But hist! I see him yonder through the trees,"
4135,ACT II.,Walking as in a dream.
4136,ACT II.,
4137,ACT II.,Don C.     He comes this way.
4138,ACT II.,
4139,ACT II.,"Hyp.  It has been truly said by some wise man,"
4140,ACT II.,"That money, grief, and love cannot be hidden."
4141,ACT II.,
4142,ACT II.,(Enter VICTORIAN in front.)
4143,ACT II.,
4144,ACT II.,Vict.  Where'er thy step has passed is holy ground!
4145,ACT II.,These groves are sacred!  I behold thee walking
4146,ACT II.,"Under these shadowy trees, where we have walked"
4147,ACT II.,"At evening, and I feel thy presence now;"
4148,ACT II.,"Feel that the place has taken a charm from thee,"
4149,ACT II.,And is forever hallowed.
4150,ACT II.,
4151,ACT II.,Hyp.          Mark him well!
4152,ACT II.,"See how he strides away with lordly air,"
4153,ACT II.,"Like that odd guest of stone, that grim Commander"
4154,ACT II.,Who comes to sup with Juan in the play.
4155,ACT II.,
4156,ACT II.,Don C.  What ho!  Victorian!
4157,ACT II.,
4158,ACT II.,Hyp.         Wilt thou sup with us?
4159,ACT II.,
4160,ACT II.,"Vict.  Hola! amigos!  Faith, I did not see you."
4161,ACT II.,How fares Don Carlos?
4162,ACT II.,
4163,ACT II.,Don C.       At your service ever.
4164,ACT II.,
4165,ACT II.,Vict.  How is that young and green-eyed Gaditana
4166,ACT II.,That you both wot of?
4167,ACT II.,
4168,ACT II.,"Don C.   Ay, soft, emerald eyes!"
4169,ACT II.,She has gone back to Cadiz.
4170,ACT II.,
4171,ACT II.,Hyp.              Ay de mi!
4172,ACT II.,
4173,ACT II.,Vict.  You are much to blame for letting her go back.
4174,ACT II.,A pretty girl; and in her tender eyes
4175,ACT II.,Just that soft shade of green we sometimes see
4176,ACT II.,In evening skies.
4177,ACT II.,
4178,ACT II.,"Hyp.  But, speaking of green eyes,"
4179,ACT II.,Are thine green?
4180,ACT II.,
4181,ACT II.,Vict.     Not a whit.  Why so?
4182,ACT II.,
4183,ACT II.,Hyp.               I think
4184,ACT II.,"The slightest shade of green would be becoming,"
4185,ACT II.,For thou art jealous.
4186,ACT II.,
4187,ACT II.,"Vid.            No, I am not jealous."
4188,ACT II.,
4189,ACT II.,Hyp.  Thou shouldst be.
4190,ACT II.,
4191,ACT II.,Vict.                  Why?
4192,ACT II.,
4193,ACT II.,Hyp.    Because thou art in love.
4194,ACT II.,And they who are in love are always jealous.
4195,ACT II.,Therefore thou shouldst be.
4196,ACT II.,
4197,ACT II.,
4198,ACT II.,"Vict.       Marry, is that all?"
4199,ACT II.,"Farewell; I am in haste.  Farewell, Don Carlos."
4200,ACT II.,Thou sayest I should be jealous?
4201,ACT II.,
4202,ACT II.,
4203,ACT II.,"Hyp.            Ay, in truth"
4204,ACT II.,I fear there is reason.  Be upon thy guard.
4205,ACT II.,I hear it whispered that the Count of Lara
4206,ACT II.,Lays siege to the same citadel.
4207,ACT II.,
4208,ACT II.,Vict.              Indeed!
4209,ACT II.,Then he will have his labor for his pains.
4210,ACT II.,
4211,ACT II.,"Hyp.  He does not think so, and Don Carlos tells me"
4212,ACT II.,He boasts of his success.
4213,ACT II.,
4214,ACT II.,"Vict.   How's this, Don Carlos?"
4215,ACT II.,
4216,ACT II.,Don. C.  Some hints of it I heard from his own lips.
4217,ACT II.,"He spoke but lightly of the lady's virtue,"
4218,ACT II.,As a gay man might speak.
4219,ACT II.,
4220,ACT II.,Vict.     Death and damnation!
4221,ACT II.,"I'll cut his lying tongue out of his mouth,"
4222,ACT II.,"And throw it to my dog!  But no, no, no!"
4223,ACT II.,"This cannot be.  You jest, indeed you jest."
4224,ACT II.,Trifle with me no more.  For otherwise
4225,ACT II.,"We are no longer friends.  And so, fare well!"
4226,ACT II.,[Exit.
4227,ACT II.,
4228,ACT II.,Hyp.  Now what a coil is here!  The Avenging Child
4229,ACT II.,"Hunting the traitor Quadros to his death,"
4230,ACT II.,"And the Moor Calaynos, when he rode"
4231,ACT II.,"To Paris for the ears of Oliver,"
4232,ACT II.,Were nothing to him!  O hot-headed youth!
4233,ACT II.,But come; we will not follow.  Let us join
4234,ACT II.,The crowd that pours into the Prado.  There
4235,ACT II.,We shall find merrier company; I see
4236,ACT II.,"The Marialonzos and the Almavivas,"
4237,ACT II.,"And fifty fans, that beckon me already."
4238,ACT II.,[Exeunt.
4239,ACT II.,
4240,ACT II.,
4241,ACT II.,
4242,ACT II.,"SCENE IV. -- PRECIOSA'S chamber.  She is sitting, with a book in"
4243,ACT II.,"her hand, near a table, on which are flowers.  A bird singing in"
4244,ACT II.,its cage. The COUNT OF LARA enters behind unperceived.
4245,ACT II.,
4246,ACT II.,Prec. (reads).
4247,ACT II.,"All are sleeping, weary heart!"
4248,ACT II.,"Thou, thou only sleepless art!"
4249,ACT II.,
4250,ACT II.,Heigho! I wish Victorian were here.
4251,ACT II.,I know not what it is makes me so restless!
4252,ACT II.,
4253,ACT II.,(The bird sings.)
4254,ACT II.,
4255,ACT II.,"Thou little prisoner with thy motley coat,"
4256,ACT II.,"That from thy vaulted, wiry dungeon singest,"
4257,ACT II.,"Like thee I am a captive, and, like thee,"
4258,ACT II.,I have a gentle jailer.  Lack-a-day!
4259,ACT II.,
4260,ACT II.,"All are sleeping, weary heart!"
4261,ACT II.,"Thou, thou only sleepless art!"
4262,ACT II.,"All this throbbing, all this aching,"
4263,ACT II.,"Evermore shall keep thee waking,"
4264,ACT II.,For a heart in sorrow breaking
4265,ACT II.,Thinketh ever of its smart!
4266,ACT II.,
4267,ACT II.,"Thou speakest truly, poet! and methinks"
4268,ACT II.,More hearts are breaking in this world of ours
4269,ACT II.,Than one would say.  In distant villages
4270,ACT II.,"And solitudes remote, where winds have wafted"
4271,ACT II.,"The barbed seeds of love, or birds of passage"
4272,ACT II.,"Scattered them in their flight, do they take root,"
4273,ACT II.,"And grow in silence, and in silence perish."
4274,ACT II.,Who hears the falling of the forest leaf?
4275,ACT II.,Or who takes note of every flower that dies?
4276,ACT II.,Heigho! I wish Victorian would come.
4277,ACT II.,Dolores!
4278,ACT II.,
4279,ACT II.,(Turns to lay down her boot and perceives the COUNT.)
4280,ACT II.,
4281,ACT II.,Ha!
4282,ACT II.,
4283,ACT II.,"Lara.      Senora, pardon me."
4284,ACT II.,
4285,ACT II.,Prec.  How's this?  Dolores!
4286,ACT II.,
4287,ACT II.,Lara.           Pardon me--
4288,ACT II.,
4289,ACT II.,Prec.               Dolores!
4290,ACT II.,
4291,ACT II.,Lara.  Be not alarmed; I found no one in waiting.
4292,ACT II.,If I have been too bold--
4293,ACT II.,
4294,ACT II.,Prec. (turning her back upon him).  You are too bold!
4295,ACT II.,"Retire! retire, and leave me!"
4296,ACT II.,
4297,ACT II.,"Lara.         My dear lady,"
4298,ACT II.,"First hear me!  I beseech you, let me speak!"
4299,ACT II.,'T is for your good I come.
4300,ACT II.,
4301,ACT II.,Prec. (turning toward him with indignation).  Begone! begone!
4302,ACT II.,"You are the Count of Lara, but your deeds"
4303,ACT II.,Would make the statues of your ancestors
4304,ACT II.,"Blush on their tombs!  Is it Castilian honor,"
4305,ACT II.,"Is it Castilian pride, to steal in here"
4306,ACT II.,"Upon a friendless girl, to do her wrong?"
4307,ACT II.,"O shame! shame! shame! that you, a nobleman,"
4308,ACT II.,Should be so little noble in your thoughts
4309,ACT II.,"As to send jewels here to win my love,"
4310,ACT II.,And think to buy my honor with your gold!
4311,ACT II.,I have no words to tell you how I scorn you!
4312,ACT II.,Begone!  The sight of you is hateful to me!
4313,ACT II.,"Begone, I say!"
4314,ACT II.,
4315,ACT II.,Lara.  Be calm; I will not harm you.
4316,ACT II.,
4317,ACT II.,Prec.  Because you dare not.
4318,ACT II.,
4319,ACT II.,Lara.             I dare anything!
4320,ACT II.,Therefore beware!  You are deceived in me.
4321,ACT II.,"In this false world, we do not always know"
4322,ACT II.,Who are our friends and who our enemies.
4323,ACT II.,"We all have enemies, and all need friends."
4324,ACT II.,"Even you, fair Preciosa, here at court"
4325,ACT II.,"Have foes, who seek to wrong you."
4326,ACT II.,
4327,ACT II.,Prec.              If to this
4328,ACT II.,"I owe the honor of the present visit,"
4329,ACT II.,"You might have spared the coming.  Raving spoken,"
4330,ACT II.,"Once more I beg you, leave me to myself."
4331,ACT II.,
4332,ACT II.,Lara.  I thought it but a friendly part to tell you
4333,ACT II.,What strange reports are current here in town.
4334,ACT II.,"For my own self, I do not credit them;"
4335,ACT II.,"But there are many who, not knowing you,"
4336,ACT II.,Will lend a readier ear.
4337,ACT II.,
4338,ACT II.,Prec.       There was no need
4339,ACT II.,That you should take upon yourself the duty
4340,ACT II.,Of telling me these tales.
4341,ACT II.,
4342,ACT II.,Lara.       Malicious tongues
4343,ACT II.,Are ever busy with your name.
4344,ACT II.,
4345,ACT II.,Prec.              Alas!
4346,ACT II.,"I've no protectors.  I am a poor girl,"
4347,ACT II.,Exposed to insults and unfeeling jests.
4348,ACT II.,"They wound me, yet I cannot shield myself."
4349,ACT II.,I give no cause for these reports.  I live
4350,ACT II.,Retired; am visited by none.
4351,ACT II.,
4352,ACT II.,Lara.             By none?
4353,ACT II.,"O, then, indeed, you are much wronged!"
4354,ACT II.,
4355,ACT II.,Prec.        How mean you?
4356,ACT II.,
4357,ACT II.,"Lara.  Nay, nay; I will not wound your gentle soul"
4358,ACT II.,By the report of idle tales.
4359,ACT II.,
4360,ACT II.,Prec.           Speak out!
4361,ACT II.,What are these idle tales? You need not spare me.
4362,ACT II.,
4363,ACT II.,Lara.  I will deal frankly with you.  Pardon me
4364,ACT II.,"This window, as I think, looks toward the street,"
4365,ACT II.,"And this into the Prado, does it not?"
4366,ACT II.,"In yon high house, beyond the garden wall,--"
4367,ACT II.,"You see the roof there just above the trees,--"
4368,ACT II.,"There lives a friend, who told me yesterday,"
4369,ACT II.,"That on a certain night,--be not offended"
4370,ACT II.,"If I too plainly speak,--he saw a man"
4371,ACT II.,Climb to your chamber window.  You are silent!
4372,ACT II.,"I would not blame you, being young and fair--"
4373,ACT II.,
4374,ACT II.,"(He tries to embrace her. She starts back, and draws a dagger"
4375,ACT II.,from her bosom.)
4376,ACT II.,
4377,ACT II.,Prec.  Beware! beware!  I am a Gypsy girl!
4378,ACT II.,Lay not your hand upon me.  One step nearer
4379,ACT II.,And I will strike!
4380,ACT II.,
4381,ACT II.,"Lara.  Pray you, put up that dagger."
4382,ACT II.,Fear not.
4383,ACT II.,
4384,ACT II.,Prec. I do not fear.  I have a heart
4385,ACT II.,In whose strength I can trust.
4386,ACT II.,
4387,ACT II.,Lara.          Listen to me
4388,ACT II.,"I come here as your friend,--I am your friend,--"
4389,ACT II.,And by a single word can put a stop
4390,ACT II.,"To all those idle tales, and make your name"
4391,ACT II.,"Spotless as lilies are.  Here on my knees,"
4392,ACT II.,"Fair Preciosa! on my knees I swear,"
4393,ACT II.,"I love you even to madness, and that love"
4394,ACT II.,"Has driven me to break the rules of custom,"
4395,ACT II.,And force myself unasked into your presence.
4396,ACT II.,
4397,ACT II.,(VICTORIAN enters behind.)
4398,ACT II.,
4399,ACT II.,"Prec.  Rise, Count of Lara!  That is not the place"
4400,ACT II.,For such as you are.  It becomes you not
4401,ACT II.,To kneel before me.  I am strangely moved
4402,ACT II.,To see one of your rank thus low and humbled;
4403,ACT II.,"For your sake I will put aside all anger,"
4404,ACT II.,"All unkind feeling, all dislike, and speak"
4405,ACT II.,"In gentleness, as most becomes a woman,"
4406,ACT II.,And as my heart now prompts me.  I no more
4407,ACT II.,"Will hate you, for all hate is painful to me."
4408,ACT II.,"But if, without offending modesty"
4409,ACT II.,"And that reserve which is a woman's glory,"
4410,ACT II.,"I may speak freely, I will teach my heart"
4411,ACT II.,To love you.
4412,ACT II.,
4413,ACT II.,Lara.  O sweet angel!
4414,ACT II.,
4415,ACT II.,"Prec.           Ay, in truth,"
4416,ACT II.,Far better than you love yourself or me.
4417,ACT II.,
4418,ACT II.,"Lara.  Give me some sign of this,--the slightest token."
4419,ACT II.,Let me but kiss your hand!
4420,ACT II.,
4421,ACT II.,"Prec.     Nay, come no nearer."
4422,ACT II.,The words I utter are its sign and token.
4423,ACT II.,Misunderstand me not!  Be not deceived!
4424,ACT II.,The love wherewith I love you is not such
4425,ACT II.,As you would offer me.  For you come here
4426,ACT II.,"To take from me the only thing I have,"
4427,ACT II.,"My honor.  You are wealthy, you have friends"
4428,ACT II.,"And kindred, and a thousand pleasant hopes"
4429,ACT II.,That fill your heart with happiness; but I
4430,ACT II.,"Am poor, and friendless, having but one treasure,"
4431,ACT II.,"And you would take that from me, and for what?"
4432,ACT II.,"To flatter your own vanity, and make me"
4433,ACT II.,"What you would most despise.  O sir, such love,"
4434,ACT II.,"That seeks to harm me, cannot be true love."
4435,ACT II.,Indeed it cannot.  But my love for you
4436,ACT II.,Is of a different kind.  It seeks your good.
4437,ACT II.,It is a holier feeling.  It rebukes
4438,ACT II.,"Your earthly passion, your unchaste desires,"
4439,ACT II.,"And bids you look into your heart, and see"
4440,ACT II.,"How you do wrong that better nature in you,"
4441,ACT II.,And grieve your soul with sin.
4442,ACT II.,
4443,ACT II.,"Lara.         I swear to you,"
4444,ACT II.,I would not harm you; I would only love you.
4445,ACT II.,"I would not take your honor, but restore it,"
4446,ACT II.,And in return I ask but some slight mark
4447,ACT II.,"Of your affection.  If indeed you love me,"
4448,ACT II.,"As you confess you do, O let me thus"
4449,ACT II.,With this embrace--
4450,ACT II.,
4451,ACT II.,Vict. (rushing forward).  Hold! hold!  This is too much.
4452,ACT II.,What means this outrage?
4453,ACT II.,
4454,ACT II.,"Lara.  First, what right have you"
4455,ACT II.,To question thus a nobleman of Spain?
4456,ACT II.,
4457,ACT II.,"Vict.  I too am noble, and you are no more!"
4458,ACT II.,Out of my sight!
4459,ACT II.,
4460,ACT II.,Lara.       Are you the master here?
4461,ACT II.,
4462,ACT II.,"Vict.  Ay, here and elsewhere, when the wrong of others"
4463,ACT II.,Gives me the right!
4464,ACT II.,
4465,ACT II.,"Prec. (to LARA).  Go! I beseech you, go!"
4466,ACT II.,
4467,ACT II.,"Vict.  I shall have business with you, Count, anon!"
4468,ACT II.,
4469,ACT II.,Lara.  You cannot come too soon!
4470,ACT II.,[Exit.
4471,ACT II.,
4472,ACT II.,Prec.           Victorian!
4473,ACT II.,"O, we have been betrayed!"
4474,ACT II.,
4475,ACT II.,Vict.      Ha! ha! betrayed!
4476,ACT II.,"'T is I have been betrayed, not we!--not we!"
4477,ACT II.,
4478,ACT II.,Prec.  Dost thou imagine--
4479,ACT II.,
4480,ACT II.,Vict.      I imagine nothing;
4481,ACT II.,I see how 't is thou whilest the time away
4482,ACT II.,When I am gone!
4483,ACT II.,
4484,ACT II.,Prec.  O speak not in that tone!
4485,ACT II.,It wounds me deeply.
4486,ACT II.,
4487,ACT II.,Vict.  'T was not meant to flatter.
4488,ACT II.,
4489,ACT II.,Prec.  Too well thou knowest the presence of that man
4490,ACT II.,Is hateful to me!
4491,ACT II.,
4492,ACT II.,Vict.     Yet I saw thee stand
4493,ACT II.,"And listen to him, when he told his love."
4494,ACT II.,
4495,ACT II.,Prec.  I did not heed his words.
4496,ACT II.,
4497,ACT II.,"Vict.       Indeed thou didst,"
4498,ACT II.,And answeredst them with love.
4499,ACT II.,
4500,ACT II.,Prec.       Hadst thou heard all--
4501,ACT II.,
4502,ACT II.,Vict.  I heard enough.
4503,ACT II.,
4504,ACT II.,Prec.      Be not so angry with me.
4505,ACT II.,
4506,ACT II.,Vict.  I am not angry; I am very calm.
4507,ACT II.,
4508,ACT II.,Prec.  If thou wilt let me speak--
4509,ACT II.,
4510,ACT II.,"Vict.       Nay, say no more."
4511,ACT II.,I know too much already.  Thou art false!
4512,ACT II.,I do not like these Gypsy marriages!

4582,ACT II.,"By daylight, when the very sunshine mocks me,"
4583,ACT II.,"And voices, and familiar sights and sounds"
4584,ACT II.,"Cry, ""Hide thyself!""  O what a thin partition"
4585,ACT II.,Doth shut out from the curious world the knowledge
4586,ACT II.,Of evil deeds that have been done in darkness!
4587,ACT II.,"Disgrace has many tongues.  My fears are windows,"
4588,ACT II.,Through which all eyes seem gazing.  Every face
4589,ACT II.,"Expresses some suspicion of my shame,"
4590,ACT II.,And in derision seems to smile at me!
4591,ACT II.,
4592,ACT II.,Hyp.  Did I not caution thee?  Did I not tell thee
4593,ACT II.,I was but half persuaded of her virtue?
4594,ACT II.,
4595,ACT II.,"Vict.  And yet, Hypolito, we may be wrong,"
4596,ACT II.,We may be over-hasty in condemning!
4597,ACT II.,The Count of Lara is a cursed villain.
4598,ACT II.,
4599,ACT II.,"Hyp.  And therefore is she cursed, loving him."
4600,ACT II.,
4601,ACT II.,Vid.  She does not love him! 'T is for gold! for gold!
4602,ACT II.,
4603,ACT II.,"Hyp.  Ay, but remember, in the public streets"
4604,ACT II.,"He shows a golden ring the Gypsy gave him,"

4606,ACT II.,
4607,ACT II.,Vict.  She had that ring from me!  God! she is false!

4609,ACT II.,Where stays the coward?
4610,ACT II.,
4611,ACT II.,"Hyp.     Nay, he is no coward;"
4612,ACT II.,"A villain, if thou wilt, but not a coward."
4613,ACT II.,I've seen him play with swords; it is his pastime.

4624,ACT II.,
4625,ACT II.,"Vict.  Not long, and yet too long.  Are you prepared?"
4626,ACT II.,
4627,ACT II.,Lara.  I am.
4628,ACT II.,
4629,ACT II.,Hyp.      It grieves me much to see this quarrel
4630,ACT II.,"Between you, gentlemen.  Is there no way"
4631,ACT II.,"Left open to accord this difference,"
4632,ACT II.,But you must make one with your swords?
4633,ACT II.,

4635,ACT II.,"I do entreat thee, dear Hypolito,"
4636,ACT II.,Stand not between me an my foe.  Too long
4637,ACT II.,Our tongues have spoken.  Let these tongues of steel

4640,ACT II.,(They fight. VICTORIAN disarms the COUNT.)
4641,ACT II.,
4642,ACT II.,Your life is mine; and what shall now withhold me
4643,ACT II.,From sending your vile soul to its account?
4644,ACT II.,
4645,ACT II.,Lara.  Strike! strike!
4646,ACT II.,
4647,ACT II.,Vict.    You are disarmed.  I will not kill you.
4648,ACT II.,I will not murder you.  Take up your sword.

4650,ACT II.,"(FRANCISCO hands the COUNT his sword, and HYPOLITO interposes.)"

4652,ACT II.,Hyp.  Enough!  Let it end here!  The Count of Lara
4653,ACT II.,"Has shown himself a brave man, and Victorian"
4654,ACT II.,"A generous one, as ever.  Now be friends."
4655,ACT II.,"Put up your swords; for, to speak frankly to you,"
4656,ACT II.,Your cause of quarrel is too slight a thing
4657,ACT II.,To move you to extremes.
4658,ACT II.,
4659,ACT II.,"Lara.          I am content,"
4660,ACT II.,"I sought no quarrel.  A few hasty words,"
4661,ACT II.,"Spoken in the heat of blood, have led to this."
4662,ACT II.,
4663,ACT II.,"Vict.  Nay, something more than that."
4664,ACT II.,
4665,ACT II.,Lara.       I understand you.
4666,ACT II.,Therein I did not mean to cross your path.
4667,ACT II.,"To me the door stood open, as to others."
4668,ACT II.,"But, had I known the girl belonged to you,"
4669,ACT II.,Never would I have sought to win her from you.
4670,ACT II.,The truth stands now revealed; she has been false
4671,ACT II.,To both of us.
4672,ACT II.,
4673,ACT II.,"Vict.       Ay, false as hell itself!"
4674,ACT II.,
4675,ACT II.,"Lara.  In truth, I did not seek her; she sought me;"
4676,ACT II.,"And told me how to win her, telling me"
4677,ACT II.,The hours when she was oftenest left alone.
4678,ACT II.,
4679,ACT II.,"Vict.  Say, can you prove this to me?  O, pluck out"
4680,ACT II.,"These awful doubts, that goad me into madness!"
4681,ACT II.,Let me know all! all! all!
4682,ACT II.,
4683,ACT II.,Lara.      You shall know all.
4684,ACT II.,"Here is my page, who was the messenger"

4687,ACT II.,

4689,ACT II.,
4690,ACT II.,Lara.         If further proof
4691,ACT II.,"Is needful, I have here a ring she gave me."

4693,ACT II.,Vict. Pray let me see that ring!  It is the same!

4695,ACT II.,"(Throws it upon the ground, and tramples upon it.)"

4697,ACT II.,Thus may she perish who once wore that ring!
4698,ACT II.,Thus do I spurn her from me; do thus trample
4699,ACT II.,"Her memory in the dust!  O Count of Lara,"
4700,ACT II.,"We both have been abused, been much abused!"
4701,ACT II.,I thank you for your courtesy and frankness.
4702,ACT II.,"Though, like the surgeon's hand, yours gave me pain,"
4703,ACT II.,"Yet it has cured my blindness, and I thank you."
4704,ACT II.,"I now can see the folly I have done,"
4705,ACT II.,"Though 't is, alas! too late.  So fare you well!"
4706,ACT II.,To-night I leave this hateful town forever.
4707,ACT II.,Regard me as your friend. Once more farewell!

6173,CARILLON,

6273,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6274,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,I beheld the pageants splendid that adorned those days of old;
6275,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"Stately dames, like queens attended, knights who bore the Fleece of Gold"
6276,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6277,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,Lombard and Venetian merchants with deep-laden argosies;
6278,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,Ministers from twenty nations; more than royal pomp and ease.
6279,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6280,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"I beheld proud Maximilian, kneeling humbly on the ground;"
6281,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"I beheld the gentle Mary, hunting with her hawk and hound;"
6282,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6283,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"And her lighted bridal-chamber, where a duke slept with the queen,"

6289,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"Saw the light at Minnewater, saw the White Hoods moving west,"
6290,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,Saw great Artevelde victorious scale the Golden Dragon's nest.
6291,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6292,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,And again the whiskered Spaniard all the land with terror smote;
6293,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,And again the wild alarum sounded from the tocsin's throat;
6294,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6295,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"Till the bell of Ghent responded o'er lagoon and dike of sand,"

6297,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6298,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,Then the sound of drums aroused me.  The awakened city's roar
6299,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,Chased the phantoms I had summoned back into their graves once more.
6300,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,
6301,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,"Hours had passed away like minutes; and, before I was aware,"
6302,THE BELFRY OF BRUGES,Lo! the shadow of the belfry crossed the sun-illumined square.

6361,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,And still I thought of thee.
6362,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,
6363,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,"But now, alas! the place seems changed;"
6364,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,Thou art no longer here:
6365,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,Part of the sunshine of the scene
6366,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,With thee did disappear.
6367,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,
6368,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,"Though thoughts, deep-rooted in my heart,"

6374,A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE,"As when the sun, concealed"

6648,RAIN IN SUMMER,And commotion;
6649,RAIN IN SUMMER,And down the wet streets
6650,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Sail their mimic fleets,"
6651,RAIN IN SUMMER,Till the treacherous pool
6652,RAIN IN SUMMER,Ingulfs them in its whirling
6653,RAIN IN SUMMER,And turbulent ocean.
6654,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6655,RAIN IN SUMMER,"In the country, on every side,"
6656,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Where far and wide,"
6657,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Like a leopard's tawny and spotted hide,"
6658,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Stretches the plain,"
6659,RAIN IN SUMMER,To the dry grass and the drier grain
6660,RAIN IN SUMMER,How welcome is the rain!
6661,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6662,RAIN IN SUMMER,In the furrowed land
6663,RAIN IN SUMMER,The toilsome and patient oxen stand;
6664,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Lifting the yoke encumbered head,"
6665,RAIN IN SUMMER,"With their dilated nostrils spread,"
6666,RAIN IN SUMMER,They silently inhale
6667,RAIN IN SUMMER,"The clover-scented gale,"
6668,RAIN IN SUMMER,And the vapors that arise
6669,RAIN IN SUMMER,From the well-watered and smoking soil.
6670,RAIN IN SUMMER,For this rest in the furrow after toil
6671,RAIN IN SUMMER,Their large and lustrous eyes
6672,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Seem to thank the Lord,"
6673,RAIN IN SUMMER,More than man's spoken word.
6674,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6675,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Near at hand,"
6676,RAIN IN SUMMER,"From under the sheltering trees,"
6677,RAIN IN SUMMER,The farmer sees
6678,RAIN IN SUMMER,"His pastures, and his fields of grain,"
6679,RAIN IN SUMMER,As they bend their tops
6680,RAIN IN SUMMER,To the numberless beating drops
6681,RAIN IN SUMMER,Of the incessant rain.
6682,RAIN IN SUMMER,He counts it as no sin
6683,RAIN IN SUMMER,That he sees therein
6684,RAIN IN SUMMER,Only his own thrift and gain.
6685,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6686,RAIN IN SUMMER,"These, and far more than these,"
6687,RAIN IN SUMMER,The Poet sees!
6688,RAIN IN SUMMER,He can behold
6689,RAIN IN SUMMER,Aquarius old
6690,RAIN IN SUMMER,Walking the fenceless fields of air;
6691,RAIN IN SUMMER,And from each ample fold
6692,RAIN IN SUMMER,Of the clouds about him rolled
6693,RAIN IN SUMMER,Scattering everywhere
6694,RAIN IN SUMMER,"The showery rain,"
6695,RAIN IN SUMMER,As the farmer scatters his grain.
6696,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6697,RAIN IN SUMMER,He can behold
6698,RAIN IN SUMMER,Things manifold
6699,RAIN IN SUMMER,"That have not yet been wholly told,--"
6700,RAIN IN SUMMER,Have not been wholly sung nor said.
6701,RAIN IN SUMMER,"For his thought, that never stops,"
6702,RAIN IN SUMMER,Follows the water-drops
6703,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Down to the graves of the dead,"
6704,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Down through chasms and gulfs profound,"
6705,RAIN IN SUMMER,To the dreary fountain-head
6706,RAIN IN SUMMER,Of lakes and rivers under ground;
6707,RAIN IN SUMMER,"And sees them, when the rain is done,"
6708,RAIN IN SUMMER,On the bridge of colors seven
6709,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Climbing up once more to heaven,"
6710,RAIN IN SUMMER,Opposite the setting sun.
6711,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6712,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Thus the Seer,"
6713,RAIN IN SUMMER,"With vision clear,"
6714,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Sees forms appear and disappear,"
6715,RAIN IN SUMMER,"In the perpetual round of strange,"
6716,RAIN IN SUMMER,Mysterious change
6717,RAIN IN SUMMER,"From birth to death, from death to birth,"
6718,RAIN IN SUMMER,"From earth to heaven, from heaven to earth;"
6719,RAIN IN SUMMER,Till glimpses more sublime
6720,RAIN IN SUMMER,"Of things, unseen before,"
6721,RAIN IN SUMMER,Unto his wondering eyes reveal
6722,RAIN IN SUMMER,"The Universe, as an immeasurable wheel"
6723,RAIN IN SUMMER,Turning forevermore
6724,RAIN IN SUMMER,In the rapid and rushing river of Time.
6725,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6726,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6727,RAIN IN SUMMER,
6728,TO A CHILD,TO A CHILD
6729,TO A CHILD,
6730,TO A CHILD,"Dear child! how radiant on thy mother's knee,"
6731,TO A CHILD,"With merry-making eyes and jocund smiles,"
6732,TO A CHILD,"Thou gazest at the painted tiles,"
6733,TO A CHILD,"Whose figures grace,"
6734,TO A CHILD,With many a grotesque form and face.
6735,TO A CHILD,The ancient chimney of thy nursery!
6736,TO A CHILD,"The lady with the gay macaw,"
6737,TO A CHILD,"The dancing girl, the grave bashaw"
6738,TO A CHILD,With bearded lip and chin;
6739,TO A CHILD,"And, leaning idly o'er his gate,"
6740,TO A CHILD,"Beneath the imperial fan of state,"
6741,TO A CHILD,The Chinese mandarin.
6742,TO A CHILD,
6743,TO A CHILD,With what a look of proud command
6744,TO A CHILD,Thou shakest in thy little hand
6745,TO A CHILD,"The coral rattle with its silver bells,"
6746,TO A CHILD,Making a merry tune!
6747,TO A CHILD,Thousands of years in Indian seas
6748,TO A CHILD,"That coral grew, by slow degrees,"
6749,TO A CHILD,Until some deadly and wild monsoon
6750,TO A CHILD,Dashed it on Coromandel's sand!
6751,TO A CHILD,Those silver bells
6752,TO A CHILD,"Reposed of yore,"
6753,TO A CHILD,"As shapeless ore,"
6754,TO A CHILD,Far down in the deep-sunken wells
6755,TO A CHILD,"Of darksome mines,"
6756,TO A CHILD,"In some obscure and sunless place,"
6757,TO A CHILD,"Beneath huge Chimborazo's base,"
6758,TO A CHILD,Or Potosi's o'erhanging pines
6759,TO A CHILD,"And thus for thee, O little child,"
6760,TO A CHILD,"Through many a danger and escape,"
6761,TO A CHILD,The tall ships passed the stormy cape;
6762,TO A CHILD,"For thee in foreign lands remote,"
6763,TO A CHILD,"Beneath a burning, tropic clime,"
6764,TO A CHILD,"The Indian peasant, chasing the wild goat,"
6765,TO A CHILD,"Himself as swift and wild,"
6766,TO A CHILD,"In falling, clutched the frail arbute,"
6767,TO A CHILD,"The fibres of whose shallow root,"
6768,TO A CHILD,"Uplifted from the soil, betrayed"
6769,TO A CHILD,"The silver veins beneath it laid,"
6770,TO A CHILD,"The buried treasures of the miser, Time."
6771,TO A CHILD,
6772,TO A CHILD,"But, lo! thy door is left ajar!"
6773,TO A CHILD,Thou hearest footsteps from afar!
6774,TO A CHILD,"And, at the sound,"
6775,TO A CHILD,Thou turnest round
6776,TO A CHILD,"With quick and questioning eyes,"
6777,TO A CHILD,"Like one, who, in a foreign land,"
6778,TO A CHILD,Beholds on every hand
6779,TO A CHILD,Some source of wonder and surprise!
6780,TO A CHILD,"And, restlessly, impatiently,"
6781,TO A CHILD,"Thou strivest, strugglest, to be free,"
6782,TO A CHILD,The four walls of thy nursery
6783,TO A CHILD,Are now like prison walls to thee.
6784,TO A CHILD,"No more thy mother's smiles,"
6785,TO A CHILD,"No more the painted tiles,"
6786,TO A CHILD,"Delight thee, nor the playthings on the floor,"
6787,TO A CHILD,"That won thy little, beating heart before;"
6788,TO A CHILD,Thou strugglest for the open door.
6789,TO A CHILD,
6790,TO A CHILD,Through these once solitary halls
6791,TO A CHILD,Thy pattering footstep falls.
6792,TO A CHILD,The sound of thy merry voice
6793,TO A CHILD,Makes the old walls
6794,TO A CHILD,"Jubilant, and they rejoice"
6795,TO A CHILD,"With the joy of thy young heart,"
6796,TO A CHILD,O'er the light of whose gladness
6797,TO A CHILD,No shadows of sadness
6798,TO A CHILD,From the sombre background of memory start.
6799,TO A CHILD,
6800,TO A CHILD,"Once, ah, once, within these walls,"
6801,TO A CHILD,"One whom memory oft recalls,"
6802,TO A CHILD,"The Father of his Country, dwelt."
6803,TO A CHILD,And yonder meadows broad and damp
6804,TO A CHILD,The fires of the besieging camp
6805,TO A CHILD,Encircled with a burning belt.
6806,TO A CHILD,"Up and down these echoing stairs,"
6807,TO A CHILD,"Heavy with the weight of cares,"
6808,TO A CHILD,Sounded his majestic tread;
6809,TO A CHILD,"Yes, within this very room"
6810,TO A CHILD,"Sat he in those hours of gloom,"
6811,TO A CHILD,Weary both in heart and head.
6812,TO A CHILD,
6813,TO A CHILD,But what are these grave thoughts to thee?
6814,TO A CHILD,"Out, out! into the open air!"
6815,TO A CHILD,"Thy only dream is liberty,"
6816,TO A CHILD,Thou carest little how or where.
6817,TO A CHILD,"I see thee eager at thy play,"
6818,TO A CHILD,"Now shouting to the apples on the tree,"
6819,TO A CHILD,With cheeks as round and red as they;
6820,TO A CHILD,"And now among the yellow stalks,"
6821,TO A CHILD,"Among the flowering shrubs and plants,"
6822,TO A CHILD,As restless as the bee.
6823,TO A CHILD,"Along the garden walks,"
6824,TO A CHILD,The tracks of thy small carriage-wheels I trace;
6825,TO A CHILD,And see at every turn how they efface
6826,TO A CHILD,"Whole villages of sand-roofed tents,"
6827,TO A CHILD,That rise like golden domes
6828,TO A CHILD,Above the cavernous and secret homes
6829,TO A CHILD,Of wandering and nomadic tribes of ants.
6830,TO A CHILD,"Ah, cruel little Tamerlane,"
6831,TO A CHILD,"Who, with thy dreadful reign,"
6832,TO A CHILD,Dost persecute and overwhelm
6833,TO A CHILD,These hapless Troglodytes of thy realm!
6834,TO A CHILD,"What! tired already! with those suppliant looks,"
6835,TO A CHILD,"And voice more beautiful than a poet's books,"
6836,TO A CHILD,Or murmuring sound of water as it flows.
6837,TO A CHILD,Thou comest back to parley with repose;
6838,TO A CHILD,"This rustic seat in the old apple-tree,"
6839,TO A CHILD,With its o'erhanging golden canopy
6840,TO A CHILD,"Of leaves illuminate with autumnal hues,"
6841,TO A CHILD,"And shining with the argent light of dews,"
6842,TO A CHILD,Shall for a season be our place of rest.
6843,TO A CHILD,"Beneath us, like an oriole's pendent nest,"
6844,TO A CHILD,"From which the laughing birds have taken wing,"
6845,TO A CHILD,"By thee abandoned, hangs thy vacant swing."
6846,TO A CHILD,Dream-like the waters of the river gleam;
6847,TO A CHILD,"A sailless vessel drops adown the stream,"
6848,TO A CHILD,"And like it, to a sea as wide and deep,"
6849,TO A CHILD,Thou driftest gently down the tides of sleep.
6850,TO A CHILD,
6851,TO A CHILD,O child! O new-born denizen
6852,TO A CHILD,Of life's great city! on thy head
6853,TO A CHILD,"The glory of the morn is shed,"
6854,TO A CHILD,Like a celestial benison!
6855,TO A CHILD,"Here at the portal thou dost stand,"
6856,TO A CHILD,And with thy little hand
6857,TO A CHILD,Thou openest the mysterious gate
6858,TO A CHILD,Into the future's undiscovered land.
6859,TO A CHILD,"I see its valves expand,"
6860,TO A CHILD,As at the touch of Fate!
6861,TO A CHILD,"Into those realms of love and hate,"
6862,TO A CHILD,"Into that darkness blank and drear,"
6863,TO A CHILD,"By some prophetic feeling taught,"
6864,TO A CHILD,"I launch the bold, adventurous thought,"
6865,TO A CHILD,Freighted with hope and fear;
6866,TO A CHILD,"As upon subterranean streams,"
6867,TO A CHILD,"In caverns unexplored and dark,"
6868,TO A CHILD,"Men sometimes launch a fragile bark,"
6869,TO A CHILD,"Laden with flickering fire,"
6870,TO A CHILD,"And watch its swift-receding beams,"
6871,TO A CHILD,"Until at length they disappear,"
6872,TO A CHILD,And in the distant dark expire.
6873,TO A CHILD,
6874,TO A CHILD,By what astrology of fear or hope
6875,TO A CHILD,Dare I to cast thy horoscope!
6876,TO A CHILD,Like the new moon thy life appears;
6877,TO A CHILD,"A little strip of silver light,"
6878,TO A CHILD,And widening outward into night
6879,TO A CHILD,The shadowy disk of future years;
6880,TO A CHILD,"And yet upon its outer rim,"
6881,TO A CHILD,"A luminous circle, faint and dim,"
6882,TO A CHILD,"And scarcely visible to us here,"
6883,TO A CHILD,Rounds and completes the perfect sphere;
6884,TO A CHILD,"A prophecy and intimation,"
6885,TO A CHILD,"A pale and feeble adumbration,"
6886,TO A CHILD,"Of the great world of light, that lies"
6887,TO A CHILD,Behind all human destinies.
6888,TO A CHILD,
6889,TO A CHILD,"Ah! if thy fate, with anguish fraught,"
6890,TO A CHILD,Should be to wet the dusty soil
6891,TO A CHILD,"With the hot tears and sweat of toil,--"
6892,TO A CHILD,"To struggle with imperious thought,"
6893,TO A CHILD,"Until the overburdened brain,"
6894,TO A CHILD,"Weary with labor, faint with pain,"
6895,TO A CHILD,"Like a jarred pendulum, retain"
6896,TO A CHILD,"Only its motion, not its power,--"
6897,TO A CHILD,"Remember, in that perilous hour,"
6898,TO A CHILD,"When most afflicted and oppressed,"
6899,TO A CHILD,From labor there shall come forth rest.
6900,TO A CHILD,
6901,TO A CHILD,And if a more auspicious fate
6902,TO A CHILD,On thy advancing steps await
6903,TO A CHILD,Still let it ever be thy pride
6904,TO A CHILD,To linger by the laborer's side;
6905,TO A CHILD,With words of sympathy or song
6906,TO A CHILD,To cheer the dreary march along
6907,TO A CHILD,"Of the great army of the poor,"
6908,TO A CHILD,"O'er desert sand, o'er dangerous moor."
6909,TO A CHILD,Nor to thyself the task shall be
6910,TO A CHILD,Without reward; for thou shalt learn
6911,TO A CHILD,The wisdom early to discern
6912,TO A CHILD,True beauty in utility;
6913,TO A CHILD,"As great Pythagoras of yore,"
6914,TO A CHILD,"Standing beside the blacksmith's door,"
6915,TO A CHILD,"And hearing the hammers, as they smote"
6916,TO A CHILD,"The anvils with a different note,"
6917,TO A CHILD,"Stole from the varying tones, that hung"
6918,TO A CHILD,"Vibrant on every iron tongue,"
6919,TO A CHILD,The secret of the sounding wire.
6920,TO A CHILD,And formed the seven-chorded lyre.
6921,TO A CHILD,
6922,TO A CHILD,Enough! I will not play the Seer;
6923,TO A CHILD,I will no longer strive to ope
6924,TO A CHILD,"The mystic volume, where appear"
6925,TO A CHILD,"The herald Hope, forerunning Fear,"
6926,TO A CHILD,"And Fear, the pursuivant of Hope."
6927,TO A CHILD,Thy destiny remains untold;
6928,TO A CHILD,"For, like Acestes' shaft of old,"
6929,TO A CHILD,"The swift thought kindles as it flies,"
6930,TO A CHILD,And burns to ashes in the skies.

6934,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION
6935,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,
6936,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"I saw, as in a dream sublime,"
6937,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,The balance in the hand of Time.
6938,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,O'er East and West its beam impended;
6939,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And day, with all its hours of light,"
6940,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Was slowly sinking out of sight,"
6941,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"While, opposite, the scale of night"
6942,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Silently with the stars ascended.
6943,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,
6944,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Like the astrologers of eld,"
6945,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,In that bright vision I beheld
6946,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Greater and deeper mysteries.
6947,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"I saw, with its celestial keys,"
6948,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Its chords of air, its frets of fire,"
6949,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"The Samian's great Aeolian lyre,"
6950,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Rising through all its sevenfold bars,"
6951,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,From earth unto the fixed stars.
6952,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And through the dewy atmosphere,"
6953,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Not only could I see, but hear,"
6954,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Its wondrous and harmonious strings,"
6955,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"In sweet vibration, sphere by sphere,"
6956,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"From Dian's circle light and near,"
6957,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Onward to vaster and wider rings.
6958,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Where, chanting through his beard of snows,"
6959,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Majestic, mournful, Saturn goes,"
6960,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,And down the sunless realms of space
6961,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Reverberates the thunder of his bass.
6962,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,
6963,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Beneath the sky's triumphal arch
6964,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"This music sounded like a march,"
6965,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,And with its chorus seemed to be
6966,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Preluding some great tragedy.
6967,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Sirius was rising in the east;
6968,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And, slow ascending one by one,"
6969,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,The kindling constellations shone.
6970,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Begirt with many a blazing star,"
6971,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Stood the great giant Algebar,"
6972,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Orion, hunter of the beast!"
6973,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"His sword hung gleaming by his side,"
6974,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And, on his arm, the lion's hide"
6975,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Scattered across the midnight air
6976,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,The golden radiance of its hair.
6977,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,
6978,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"The moon was pallid, but not faint;"
6979,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And beautiful as some fair saint,"
6980,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Serenely moving on her way
6981,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,In hours of trial and dismay.
6982,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"As if she heard the voice of God,"
6983,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Unharmed with naked feet she trod
6984,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Upon the hot and burning stars,"
6985,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"As on the glowing coals and bars,"
6986,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"That were to prove her strength, and try"
6987,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Her holiness and her purity.
6988,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,
6989,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Thus moving on, with silent pace,"
6990,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And triumph in her sweet, pale face,"
6991,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,She reached the station of Orion.
6992,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Aghast he stood in strange alarm!
6993,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,And suddenly from his outstretched arm
6994,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Down fell the red skin of the lion
6995,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Into the river at his feet.
6996,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,His mighty club no longer beat
6997,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,The forehead of the bull; but he
6998,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Reeled as of yore beside the sea,"
6999,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"When, blinded by Oenopion,"
7000,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"He sought the blacksmith at his forge,"
7001,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And, climbing up the mountain gorge,"
7002,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,Fixed his blank eyes upon the sun.
7003,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,
7004,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Then, through the silence overhead,"
7005,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"An angel with a trumpet said,"
7006,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"""Forevermore, forevermore,"
7007,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"The reign of violence is o'er!"""
7008,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"And, like an instrument that flings"
7009,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Its music on another's strings,"
7010,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,The trumpet of the angel cast
7011,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Upon the heavenly lyre its blast,"
7012,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,And on from sphere to sphere the words
7013,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"Re-echoed down the burning chords,--"
7014,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"""Forevermore, forevermore,"
7015,THE OCCULTATION OF ORION,"The reign of violence is o'er!"""

7019,THE BRIDGE,THE BRIDGE
7020,THE BRIDGE,
7021,THE BRIDGE,"I stood on the bridge at midnight,"
7022,THE BRIDGE,"As the clocks were striking the hour,"
7023,THE BRIDGE,"And the moon rose o'er the city,"
7024,THE BRIDGE,Behind the dark church-tower.
7025,THE BRIDGE,
7026,THE BRIDGE,I saw her bright reflection
7027,THE BRIDGE,"In the waters under me,"
7028,THE BRIDGE,Like a golden goblet falling
7029,THE BRIDGE,And sinking into the sea.
7030,THE BRIDGE,
7031,THE BRIDGE,And far in the hazy distance
7032,THE BRIDGE,"Of that lovely night in June,"
7033,THE BRIDGE,The blaze of the flaming furnace
7034,THE BRIDGE,Gleamed redder than the moon.
7035,THE BRIDGE,
7036,THE BRIDGE,"Among the long, black rafters"
7037,THE BRIDGE,"The wavering shadows lay,"
7038,THE BRIDGE,And the current that came from the ocean
7039,THE BRIDGE,Seemed to lift and bear them away;
7040,THE BRIDGE,
7041,THE BRIDGE,"As, sweeping and eddying through them,"
7042,THE BRIDGE,"Rose the belated tide,"
7043,THE BRIDGE,"And, streaming into the moonlight,"
7044,THE BRIDGE,The seaweed floated wide.
7045,THE BRIDGE,
7046,THE BRIDGE,And like those waters rushing
7047,THE BRIDGE,"Among the wooden piers,"
7048,THE BRIDGE,A flood of thoughts came o'er me
7049,THE BRIDGE,That filled my eyes with tears.
7050,THE BRIDGE,
7051,THE BRIDGE,"How often, oh, how often,"
7052,THE BRIDGE,"In the days that had gone by,"
7053,THE BRIDGE,I had stood on that bridge at midnight
7054,THE BRIDGE,And gazed on that wave and sky!
7055,THE BRIDGE,
7056,THE BRIDGE,"How often, oh, how often,"
7057,THE BRIDGE,I had wished that the ebbing tide
7058,THE BRIDGE,Would bear me away on its bosom
7059,THE BRIDGE,O'er the ocean wild and wide!
7060,THE BRIDGE,
7061,THE BRIDGE,"For my heart was hot and restless,"
7062,THE BRIDGE,"And my life was full of care,"
7063,THE BRIDGE,And the burden laid upon me
7064,THE BRIDGE,Seemed greater than I could bear.
7065,THE BRIDGE,
7066,THE BRIDGE,"But now it has fallen from me,"
7067,THE BRIDGE,It is buried in the sea;
7068,THE BRIDGE,And only the sorrow of others
7069,THE BRIDGE,Throws its shadow over me.
7070,THE BRIDGE,
7071,THE BRIDGE,Yet whenever I cross the river
7072,THE BRIDGE,"On its bridge with wooden piers,"
7073,THE BRIDGE,Like the odor of brine from the ocean
7074,THE BRIDGE,Comes the thought of other years.
7075,THE BRIDGE,
7076,THE BRIDGE,And I think how many thousands
7077,THE BRIDGE,"Of care-encumbered men,"
7078,THE BRIDGE,"Each bearing his burden of sorrow,"
7079,THE BRIDGE,Have crossed the bridge since then.
7080,THE BRIDGE,
7081,THE BRIDGE,I see the long procession
7082,THE BRIDGE,"Still passing to and fro,"
7083,THE BRIDGE,"The young heart hot and restless,"
7084,THE BRIDGE,And the old subdued and slow!
7085,THE BRIDGE,
7086,THE BRIDGE,"And forever and forever,"
7087,THE BRIDGE,"As long as the river flows,"
7088,THE BRIDGE,"As long as the heart has passions,"
7089,THE BRIDGE,As long as life has woes;
7090,THE BRIDGE,
7091,THE BRIDGE,The moon and its broken reflection
7092,THE BRIDGE,"And its shadows shall appear,"
7093,THE BRIDGE,"As the symbol of love in heaven,"
7094,THE BRIDGE,And its wavering image here.

7117,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Pave the floors of thy palace-halls with gold, and in summer"
7118,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,Pine-trees waft through its chambers the odorous breath of their branches.
7119,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"There thou art strong and great, a hero, a tamer of horses!"
7120,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"There thou chasest the stately stag on the banks of the Elkhorn,"

7123,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,Blackfeet!
7124,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,
7125,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,Hark! what murmurs arise from the heart of those mountainous deserts?
7126,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Is it the cry of the Foxes and Crows, or the mighty Behemoth,"
7127,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Who, unharmed, on his tusks once caught the bolts of the thunder,"
7128,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,And now lurks in his lair to destroy the race of the red man?
7129,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Far more fatal to thee and thy race than the Crows and the Foxes,"
7130,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Far more fatal to thee and thy race than the tread of Behemoth,"
7131,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Lo! the big thunder-canoe, that steadily breasts the Missouri's"
7132,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Merciless current! and yonder, afar on the prairies, the camp-fires"
7133,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,Gleam through the night; and the cloud of dust in the gray of the daybreak
7134,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Marks not the buffalo's track, nor the Mandan's dexterous horse-race;"
7135,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"It is a caravan, whitening the desert where dwell the Camanches!"
7136,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,"Ha! how the breath of these Saxons and Celts, like the blast of the east-wind,"
7137,TO THE DRIVING CLOUD,Drifts evermore to the west the scanty smokes of thy wigwams!

7150,THE DAY IS DONE,I see the lights of the village
7151,THE DAY IS DONE,"Gleam through the rain and the mist,"
7152,THE DAY IS DONE,And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
7153,THE DAY IS DONE,That my soul cannot resist:
7154,THE DAY IS DONE,
7155,THE DAY IS DONE,"A feeling of sadness and longing,"
7156,THE DAY IS DONE,"That is not akin to pain,"
7157,THE DAY IS DONE,And resembles sorrow only
7158,THE DAY IS DONE,As the mist resembles the rain.
7159,THE DAY IS DONE,
7160,THE DAY IS DONE,"Come, read to me some poem,"
7161,THE DAY IS DONE,"Some simple and heartfelt lay,"

7169,THE DAY IS DONE,
7170,THE DAY IS DONE,"For, like strains of martial music,"
7171,THE DAY IS DONE,Their mighty thoughts suggest
7172,THE DAY IS DONE,Life's endless toil and endeavor;
7173,THE DAY IS DONE,And to-night I long for rest.
7174,THE DAY IS DONE,
7175,THE DAY IS DONE,"Read from some humbler poet,"
7176,THE DAY IS DONE,"Whose songs gushed from his heart,"

7178,THE DAY IS DONE,Or tears from the eyelids start;

7180,THE DAY IS DONE,"Who, through long days of labor,"
7181,THE DAY IS DONE,"And nights devoid of ease,"
7182,THE DAY IS DONE,Still heard in his soul the music
7183,THE DAY IS DONE,Of wonderful melodies.
7184,THE DAY IS DONE,
7185,THE DAY IS DONE,Such songs have power to quiet
7186,THE DAY IS DONE,"The restless pulse of care,"
7187,THE DAY IS DONE,And come like the benediction
7188,THE DAY IS DONE,That follows after prayer.
7189,THE DAY IS DONE,
7190,THE DAY IS DONE,Then read from the treasured volume
7191,THE DAY IS DONE,"The poem of thy choice,"
7192,THE DAY IS DONE,And lend to the rhyme of the poet
7193,THE DAY IS DONE,The beauty of thy voice.
7194,THE DAY IS DONE,
7195,THE DAY IS DONE,And the night shall be filled with music
7196,THE DAY IS DONE,"And the cares, that infest the day,"
7197,THE DAY IS DONE,"Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,"
7198,THE DAY IS DONE,And as silently steal away.

7220,AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY,"Like fearful shadows,"
7221,AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY,Slowly passes

7229,AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY,"Shadows are trailing,"
7230,AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY,My heart is bewailing
7231,AFTERNOON IN FEBRUARY,And tolling within

7723,I,"In the Acadian land, on the shores of the Basin of Minas,"
7724,I,"Distant, secluded, still, the little village of Grand-Pre"
7725,I,"Lay in the fruitful valley.  Vast meadows stretched to the eastward,"
7726,I,"Giving the village its name, and pasture to flocks without number."
7727,I,"Dikes, that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant,"
7728,I,Shut out the turbulent tides; but at stated seasons the flood-gates
7729,I,"Opened, and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows."
7730,I,"West and south there were fields of flax, and orchards and cornfields"
7731,I,Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain; and away to the northward
7732,I,"Blomidon rose, and the forests old, and aloft on the mountains"
7733,I,"Sea-fogs pitched their tents, and mists from the mighty Atlantic"
7734,I,"Looked on the happy valley, but ne'er from their station descended"
7735,I,"There, in the midst of its farms, reposed the Acadian village."
7736,I,"Strongly built were the houses, with frames of oak and of hemlock,"
7737,I,Such as the peasants of Normandy built in the reign of the Henries.
7738,I,"Thatched were the roofs, with dormer-windows; and gables projecting"
7739,I,Over the basement below protected and shaded the doorway.
7740,I,"There in the tranquil evenings of summer, when brightly the sunset"
7741,I,"Lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys,"
7742,I,Matrons and maidens sat in snow-white caps and in kirtles
7743,I,"Scarlet and blue and green, with distaffs spinning the golden"
7744,I,"Flax for the gossiping looms, whose noisy shuttles within doors"
7745,I,"Mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens,"
7746,I,"Solemnly down the street came the parish priest, and the children"
7747,I,Paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them.
7748,I,"Reverend walked he among them; and up rose matrons and maidens,"
7749,I,Hailing his slow approach with words of affectionate welcome.
7750,I,"Then came the laborers home from the field, and serenely the sun sank"
7751,I,"Down to his rest, and twilight prevailed.  Anon from the belfry"
7752,I,"Softly the Angelus sounded, and over the roofs of the village"
7753,I,"Columns of pale blue smoke, like clouds of incense ascending,"
7754,I,"Rose from a hundred hearths, the homes of peace and contentment."
7755,I,"Thus dwelt together in love these simple Acadian farmers,--"
7756,I,Dwelt in the love of God and of man.  Alike were they free from
7757,I,"Fear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics."
7758,I,"Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;"
7759,I,But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners;
7760,I,"There the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance."
7761,I,
7762,I,"Somewhat apart from the village, and nearer the Basin of Minas,"
7763,I,"Benedict Bellefontaine, the wealthiest farmer of Grand-Pre,"
7764,I,"Dwelt on his goodly acres: and with him, directing his household,"
7765,I,"Gentle Evangeline lived, his child, and the pride of the village."
7766,I,Stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters;
7767,I,"Hearty and hale was he, an oak that is covered with snow-flakes;"
7768,I,"White as the snow were his locks, and his cheeks as brown as the oak-leaves."
7769,I,"Fair was she to behold, that maiden of seventeen summers."
7770,I,"Black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside,"
7771,I,"Black, yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses!"
7772,I,Sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows.
7773,I,When in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
7774,I,"Flagons of home-brewed ale, ah! fair in sooth was the maiden,"
7775,I,"Fairer was she when, on Sunday morn, while the bell from its turret"
7776,I,"Sprinkled with holy sounds the air, as the priest with his hyssop"
7777,I,"Sprinkles the congregation, and scatters blessings upon them,"
7778,I,"Down the long street she passed, with her chaplet of beads and her missal,"
7779,I,"Wearing her Norman cap and her kirtle of blue, and the ear-rings,"
7780,I,"Brought in the olden time from France, and since, as an heirloom,"
7781,I,"Handed down from mother to child, through long generations."
7782,I,But a celestial brightness--a more ethereal beauty--
7783,I,"Shone on her face and encircled her form, when, after confession,"
7784,I,Homeward serenely she walked with God's benediction upon her.
7785,I,"When she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music."
7786,I,
7787,I,"Firmly builded with rafters of oak, the house of the farmer"
7788,I,Stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea; and a shady
7789,I,"Sycamore grew by the door, with a woodbine wreathing around it."
7790,I,"Rudely carved was the porch, with seats beneath; and a footpath"
7791,I,"Led through an orchard wide, and disappeared in the meadow."
7792,I,"Under the sycamore-tree were hives overhung by a penthouse,"
7793,I,"Such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside,"
7794,I,"Built o'er a box for the poor, or the blessed image of Mary."
7795,I,"Farther down, on the slope of the hill, was the well with its moss-grown"
7796,I,"Bucket, fastened with iron, and near it a trough for the horses."
7797,I,"Shielding the house from storms, on the north, were the barns and the farm-yard,"
7798,I,There stood the broad-wheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows;
7799,I,"There were the folds for the sheep; and there, in his feathered seraglio,"
7800,I,"Strutted the lordly turkey, and crowed the cock, with the selfsame"
7801,I,Voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent Peter.
7802,I,"Bursting with hay were the barns, themselves a village.  In each one"
7803,I,"Far o'er the gable projected a roof of thatch; and a staircase,"
7804,I,"Under the sheltering eaves, led up to the odorous corn-loft."
7805,I,"There too the dove-cot stood, with its meek and innocent inmates"
7806,I,Murmuring ever of love; while above in the variant breezes
7807,I,Numberless noisy weathercocks rattled and sang of mutation.
7808,I,
7809,I,"Thus, at peace with God and the world, the farmer of Grand-Pre"
7810,I,"Lived on his sunny farm, and Evangeline governed his household."
7811,I,"Many a youth, as he knelt in the church and opened his missal,"
7812,I,Fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion;
7813,I,Happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment!
7814,I,"Many a suitor came to her door, by the darkness befriended,"
7815,I,"And, as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps,"
7816,I,"Knew not which beat the louder, his heart or the knocker of iron;"
7817,I,"Or at the joyous feast of the Patron Saint of the village,"
7818,I,"Bolder grew, and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered"
7819,I,"Hurried words of love, that seemed a part of the music."
7820,I,"But, among all who came, young Gabriel only was welcome;"
7821,I,"Gabriel Lajeunesse, the son of Basil the blacksmith,"
7822,I,"Who was a mighty man in the village, and honored of all men;"
7823,I,"For, since the birth of time, throughout all ages and nations,"
7824,I,Has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people.
7825,I,Basil was Benedict's friend.  Their children from earliest childhood
7826,I,"Grew up together as brother and sister; and Father Felician,"
7827,I,"Priest and pedagogue both in the village, had taught them their letters"
7828,I,"Out of the selfsame book, with the hymns of the church and the plain-song."
7829,I,"But when the hymn was sung, and the daily lesson completed,"
7830,I,Swiftly they hurried away to the forge of Basil the blacksmith.
7831,I,"There at the door they stood, with wondering eyes to behold him"
7832,I,"Take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything,"
7833,I,Nailing the shoe in its place; while near him the tire of the cart-wheel
7834,I,"Lay like a fiery snake, coiled round in a circle of cinders."
7835,I,"Oft on autumnal eves, when without in the gathering darkness"
7836,I,"Bursting with light seemed the smithy, through every cranny and crevice,"
7837,I,"Warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows,"
7838,I,"And as its panting ceased, and the sparks expired in the ashes,"
7839,I,"Merrily laughed, and said they were nuns going into the chapel."
7840,I,"Oft on sledges in winter, as swift as the swoop of the eagle,"
7841,I,"Down the hillside hounding, they glided away o'er the meadow."
7842,I,"Oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters,"
7843,I,"Seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone, which the swallow"
7844,I,Brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings;
7845,I,Lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow!
7846,I,"Thus passed a few swift years, and they no longer were children."
7847,I,"He was a valiant youth, and his face, like the face of the morning,"
7848,I,"Gladdened the earth with its light, and ripened thought into action."
7849,I,"She was a woman now, with the heart and hopes of a woman."
7850,I,"""Sunshine of Saint Eulalie"" was she called; for that was the sunshine"
7851,I,"Which, as the farmers believed, would load their orchards with apples"
7852,I,"She, too, would bring to her husband's house delight and abundance,"
7853,I,Filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children.
7854,I,
7855,I,
7856,I,
7857,II,II
7858,II,
7859,II,"Now had the season returned, when the nights grow colder and longer,"
7860,II,And the retreating sun the sign of the Scorpion enters.
7861,II,"Birds of passage sailed through the leaden air, from the ice-bound,"
7862,II,"Desolate northern bays to the shores of tropical islands,"
7863,II,Harvests were gathered in; and wild with the winds of September
7864,II,"Wrestled the trees of the forest, as Jacob of old with the angel."
7865,II,All the signs foretold a winter long and inclement.
7866,II,"Bees, with prophetic instinct of want, had hoarded their honey"
7867,II,Till the hives overflowed; and the Indian bunters asserted
7868,II,"Cold would the winter be, for thick was the fur of the foxes."
7869,II,"Such was the advent of autumn.  Then followed that beautiful season,"
7870,II,Called by the pious Acadian peasants the Summer of All-Saints!
7871,II,Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape
7872,II,Lay as if new-created in all the freshness of childhood.
7873,II,"Peace seemed to reign upon earth, and the restless heart of the ocean"
7874,II,Was for a moment consoled.  All sounds were in harmony blended.
7875,II,"Voices of children at play, the crowing of cocks in the farm-yards,"
7876,II,"Whir of wings in the drowsy air, and the cooing of pigeons,"
7877,II,"All were subdued and low as the murmurs of love, and the great sun"
7878,II,Looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him;
7879,II,"While arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow,"
7880,II,"Bright with the sheen of the dew, each glittering tree of the forest"
7881,II,Flashed like the plane-tree the Persian adorned with mantles and
7882,II,jewels.
7883,II,
7884,II,Now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness.
7885,II,"Day with its burden and heat had departed, and twilight descending"
7886,II,"Brought back the evening star to the sky, and the herds to the homestead."
7887,II,"Pawing the ground they came, and resting their necks on each other,"
7888,II,And with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening.
7889,II,"Foremost, bearing the bell, Evangeline's beautiful heifer,"
7890,II,"Proud of her snow-white hide, and the ribbon that waved from her collar,"
7891,II,"Quietly paced and slow, as if conscious of human affection."
7892,II,"Then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside,"
7893,II,"Where was their favorite pasture.  Behind them followed the watch-dog,"
7894,II,"Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,"
7895,II,"Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly"
7896,II,"Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;"
7897,II,"Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,"
7898,II,"When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled."
7899,II,"Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,"
7900,II,"Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor."
7901,II,"Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,"
7902,II,"While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,"
7903,II,"Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,"
7904,II,"Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms."
7905,II,"Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders"
7906,II,Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence
7907,II,Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.
7908,II,"Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,"
7909,II,Echoed back by the barns.  Anon they sank into stillness;
7910,II,"Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,"
7911,II,"Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent."
7912,II,
7913,II,"In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer"
7914,II,"Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths"
7915,II,"Struggled together like foes in a burning city.  Behind him,"
7916,II,"Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic,"
7917,II,"Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness."
7918,II,"Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair"
7919,II,"Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser"
7920,II,"Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine."
7921,II,"Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,"
7922,II,"Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him"
7923,II,Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.
7924,II,"Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,"
7925,II,"Spinning flax for the loom, that stood in the corner behind her."
7926,II,"Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,"
7927,II,"While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,"
7928,II,Followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together.
7929,II,"As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,"
7930,II,"Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar,"
7931,II,"So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked."
7932,II,
7933,II,"Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,"
7934,II,"Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges."
7935,II,"Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,"
7936,II,And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.
7937,II,"""Welcome!"" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold."
7938,II,"""Welcome, Basil, my friend!  Come, take thy place on the settle"
7939,II,"Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;"
7940,II,Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;
7941,II,Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
7942,II,Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
7943,II,"Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes."""
7944,II,"Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,"
7945,II,Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:--
7946,II,"""Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!"
7947,II,"Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with"
7948,II,"Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them."
7949,II,"Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe."""
7950,II,"Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,"
7951,II,"And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:--"
7952,II,"""Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors"
7953,II,"Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us."
7954,II,What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded
7955,II,"On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate"
7956,II,Will be proclaimed as law in the land.  Alas! in the mean time
7957,II,"Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people."""
7958,II,"Then made answer the farmer:--""Perhaps some friendlier purpose"
7959,II,Brings these ships to our shores.  Perhaps the harvests in England
7960,II,"By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,"
7961,II,"And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children."""
7962,II,"""Not so thinketh the folk in the village,"" said, warmly, the blacksmith,"
7963,II,"Shaking his head, as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:--"
7964,II,"""Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal."
7965,II,"Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,"
7966,II,Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.
7967,II,"Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;"
7968,II,"Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower."""
7969,II,Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:--
7970,II,"""Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,"
7971,II,"Safer within these peaceful dikes, besieged by the ocean,"
7972,II,"Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon."
7973,II,"Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow"
7974,II,Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.
7975,II,Built are the house and the barn.  The merry lads of the village
7976,II,"Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,"
7977,II,"Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth."
7978,II,"Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn."
7979,II,"Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?"""
7980,II,"As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,"
7981,II,"Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,"
7982,II,"And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered."
7983,II,
7984,II,
7985,II,
7986,III,III
7987,III,
7988,III,"Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,"
7989,III,"Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;"
7990,III,"Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung"
7991,III,Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows
7992,III,"Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal."
7993,III,"Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred"
7994,III,"Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick."
7995,III,"Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,"
7996,III,Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.
7997,III,"Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,"
7998,III,"Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike."
7999,III,"He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;"
8000,III,"For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,"
8001,III,"And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,"
8002,III,"And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened"
8003,III,"Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;"
8004,III,"And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,"
8005,III,"And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,"
8006,III,"And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,"
8007,III,With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.
8008,III,"Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,"
8009,III,"Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,"
8010,III,"""Father Leblanc,"" he exclaimed, ""thou hast heard the talk in the village,"
8011,III,"And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand."""
8012,III,"Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,--"
8013,III,"""Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;"
8014,III,And what their errand may be I know not better than others.
8015,III,Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention
8016,III,"Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?"""
8017,III,"""God's name!"" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;"
8018,III,"""Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?"
8019,III,"Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!"""
8020,III,"But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,--"
8021,III,"""Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice"
8022,III,"Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,"
8023,III,"When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal."""
8024,III,"This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it"
8025,III,When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.
8026,III,"""Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,"
8027,III,"Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice"
8028,III,"Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,"
8029,III,"And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided"
8030,III,"Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people."
8031,III,"Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,"
8032,III,Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.
8033,III,But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;
8034,III,"Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty"
8035,III,Ruled with an iron rod.  Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace
8036,III,"That a necklace of pearls was lost, and erelong a suspicion"
8037,III,Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.
8038,III,"She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,"
8039,III,Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.
8040,III,"As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,"
8041,III,Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder
8042,III,"Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand"
8043,III,"Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,"
8044,III,"And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,"
8045,III,"Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven."""
8046,III,"Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith"
8047,III,"Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;"
8048,III,"All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors"
8049,III,Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.
8050,III,
8051,III,"Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,"
8052,III,"Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed"
8053,III,"Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pre;"
8054,III,"While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,"
8055,III,"Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,"
8056,III,Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.
8057,III,"Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,"
8058,III,And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.
8059,III,Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
8060,III,Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;
8061,III,"And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,"
8062,III,Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.
8063,III,"Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,"
8064,III,"While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,"
8065,III,Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.
8066,III,Soon was the game begun.  In friendly contention the old men
8067,III,"Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuver,"
8068,III,"Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row"
8069,III,"Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,"
8070,III,"Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise"
8071,III,Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.
8072,III,"Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,"
8073,III,"Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels."
8074,III,
8075,III,Thus was the evening passed.  Anon the bell from the belfry
8076,III,"Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway"
8077,III,Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.
8078,III,Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step
8079,III,"Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness."
8080,III,"Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,"
8081,III,And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.
8082,III,Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.
8083,III,"Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,"
8084,III,Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.
8085,III,"Silent she passed the hall, and entered the door of her chamber."
8086,III,"Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press"
8087,III,"Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded"
8088,III,"Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven."
8089,III,"This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,"
8090,III,"Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife."
8091,III,"Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight"
8092,III,"Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden"
8093,III,"Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean."
8094,III,"Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with"
8095,III,Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!
8096,III,"Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,"
8097,III,Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.
8098,III,"Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness"
8099,III,"Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight"
8100,III,Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.
8101,III,"And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass"
8102,III,"Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,"
8103,III,As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar!
8104,III,
8105,III,
8106,IV,IV
8107,IV,
8108,IV,Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pre.
8109,IV,"Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,"
8110,IV,"Where the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor."
8111,IV,"Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor"
8112,IV,Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.
8113,IV,"Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,"
8114,IV,Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.
8115,IV,Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
8116,IV,"Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,"
8117,IV,"Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,"
8118,IV,"Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway."
8119,IV,"Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced."
8120,IV,Thronged were the streets with people; and noisy groups at the house-doors
8121,IV,"Sat in the cheerful sun, and rejoiced and gossiped together."
8122,IV,"Every house was an inn, where all were welcomed and feasted;"
8123,IV,"For with this simple people, who lived like brothers together,"
8124,IV,"All things were held in common, and what one had was another's."
8125,IV,Yet under Benedict's roof hospitality seemed more abundant:
8126,IV,For Evangeline stood among the guests of her father;
8127,IV,"Bright was her face with smiles, and words of welcome and gladness"
8128,IV,"Fell from her beautiful lips, and blessed the cup as she gave it."
8129,IV,
8130,IV,"Under the open sky, in the odorous air of the orchard,"
8131,IV,"Stript of its golden fruit, was spread the feast of betrothal."
8132,IV,There in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated;
8133,IV,"There good Benedict sat, and sturdy Basil the blacksmith."
8134,IV,"Not far withdrawn from these, by the cider-press and the beehives,"
8135,IV,"Michael the fiddler was placed, with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats."
8136,IV,Shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow-white
8137,IV,"Hair, as it waved in the wind; and the jolly face of the fiddler"
8138,IV,Glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers.
8139,IV,"Gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle,"
8140,IV,"Tous les Bourgeois de Chartres, and Le Carillon de Dunkerque,"
8141,IV,And anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music.
8142,IV,"Merrily, merrily whirled the wheels of the dizzying dances"
8143,IV,Under the orchard-trees and down the path to the meadows;
8144,IV,"Old folk and young together, and children mingled among them."
8145,IV,"Fairest of all the maids was Evangeline, Benedict's daughter!"
8146,IV,"Noblest of all the youths was Gabriel, son of the blacksmith!"
8147,IV,
8148,IV,So passed the morning away.  And lo! with a summons sonorous
8149,IV,"Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat."
8150,IV,"Thronged erelong was the church with men.  Without, in the churchyard,"
8151,IV,"Waited the women.  They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones"
8152,IV,Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.
8153,IV,"Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them"
8154,IV,Entered the sacred portal.  With loud and dissonant clangor
8155,IV,"Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,--"
8156,IV,"Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal"
8157,IV,"Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers."
8158,IV,"Then uprose their commander, and spoke from the steps of the altar,"
8159,IV,"Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission."
8160,IV,"""You are convened this day,"" he said, ""by his Majesty's orders."
8161,IV,"Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness,"
8162,IV,Let your own hearts reply!  To my natural make and my temper
8163,IV,"Painful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous."
8164,IV,"Yet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch;"
8165,IV,"Namely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds"
8166,IV,Forfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province
8167,IV,Be transported to other lands.  God grant you may dwell there
8168,IV,"Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!"
8169,IV,"Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty's pleasure!"""
8170,IV,"As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,"
8171,IV,"Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones"
8172,IV,"Beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,"
8173,IV,"Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,"
8174,IV,"Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;"
8175,IV,So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.
8176,IV,"Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose"
8177,IV,"Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,"
8178,IV,"And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way."
8179,IV,Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations
8180,IV,Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others
8181,IV,"Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,"
8182,IV,"As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows."
8183,IV,"Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,--"
8184,IV,"""Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!"
8185,IV,"Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!"""
8186,IV,"More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier"
8187,IV,"Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement."
8188,IV,
8189,IV,"In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,"
8190,IV,"Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician"
8191,IV,"Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar."
8192,IV,"Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence"
8193,IV,All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;
8194,IV,Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful
8195,IV,"Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes."
8196,IV,"""What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?"
8197,IV,"Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,"
8198,IV,"Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!"
8199,IV,"Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?"
8200,IV,Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?
8201,IV,"This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it"
8202,IV,Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?
8203,IV,Lo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!
8204,IV,See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!
8205,IV,"Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, 'O Father, forgive them!'"
8206,IV,"Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,"
8207,IV,"Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father, forgive them!'"""
8208,IV,"Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people"
8209,IV,"Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,"
8210,IV,"While they repeated his prayer, and said, ""O Father, forgive them!"""
8211,IV,
8212,IV,Then came the evening service.  The tapers gleamed from the altar.
8213,IV,"Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,"
8214,IV,"Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria"
8215,IV,"Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,"
8216,IV,"Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven."
8217,IV,
8218,IV,"Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides"
8219,IV,"Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children."
8220,IV,"Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand"
8221,IV,"Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,"
8222,IV,"Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each"
8223,IV,"Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows."
8224,IV,Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;
8225,IV,"There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers;"
8226,IV,"There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy;"
8227,IV,"And, at the head of the board, the great arm-chair of the farmer."
8228,IV,"Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset"
8229,IV,Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows.
8230,IV,"Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,"
8231,IV,"And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,--"
8232,IV,"Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience!"
8233,IV,"Then, all-forgetful of self, she wandered into the village,"
8234,IV,"Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,"
8235,IV,"As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,"
8236,IV,"Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children."
8237,IV,"Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors"
8238,IV,"Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai."
8239,IV,Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.
8240,IV,
8241,IV,"Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered."
8242,IV,All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows
8243,IV,"Stood she, and listened and looked, till, overcome by emotion,"
8244,IV,"""Gabriel!"" cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer"
8245,IV,"Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living."
8246,IV,Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.
8247,IV,"Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted,"
8248,IV,"Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror."
8249,IV,Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.
8250,IV,In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall
8251,IV,Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.
8252,IV,Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder
8253,IV,"Told her that God was in heaven, and governed the world he created!"
8254,IV,Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;
8255,IV,"Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning."
8256,IV,
8257,IV,
8258,V,V
8259,V,
8260,V,Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day
8261,V,Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm-house.
8262,V,"Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession,"
8263,V,"Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,"
8264,V,"Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,"
8265,V,"Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,"
8266,V,Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.
8267,V,"Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,"
8268,V,While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.
8269,V,
8270,V,Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach
8271,V,Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants.
8272,V,All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;
8273,V,All day long the wains came laboring down from the village.
8274,V,"Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,"
8275,V,Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.
8276,V,Thither the women and children thronged.  On a sudden the church-doors
8277,V,"Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession"
8278,V,"Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers."
8279,V,"Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,"
8280,V,"Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,"
8281,V,So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended
8282,V,"Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters."
8283,V,"Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices,"
8284,V,Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:--
8285,V,"""Sacred heart of the Saviour!  O inexhaustible fountain!"
8286,V,"Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!"""
8287,V,"Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside"
8288,V,"Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them"
8289,V,"Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed."
8290,V,
8291,V,"Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,"
8292,V,"Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,--"
8293,V,"Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,"
8294,V,And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.
8295,V,"Team then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him,"
8296,V,"Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,--"
8297,V,"""Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another"
8298,V,"Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!"""
8299,V,"Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father"
8300,V,Saw she slowly advancing.  Alas! how changed was his aspect!
8301,V,"Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep"
8302,V,Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.
8303,V,"But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,"
8304,V,Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.
8305,V,Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.
8306,V,
8307,V,"There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking."
8308,V,Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion
8309,V,"Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children"
8310,V,"Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties."
8311,V,"So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,"
8312,V,While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.
8313,V,"Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight"
8314,V,Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean
8315,V,"Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach"
8316,V,"Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed."
8317,V,"Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,"
8318,V,"Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,"
8319,V,"All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,"
8320,V,Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.
8321,V,"Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,"
8322,V,"Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving"
8323,V,Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.
8324,V,"Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures;"
8325,V,Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders;
8326,V,"Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,--"
8327,V,Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.
8328,V,"Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,"
8329,V,"Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows."
8330,V,
8331,V,"But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,"
8332,V,Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.
8333,V,"Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,"
8334,V,"Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children."
8335,V,"Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,"
8336,V,"Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,"
8337,V,Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore.
8338,V,"Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,"
8339,V,"And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,"
8340,V,"Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,"
8341,V,E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.
8342,V,"Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,"
8343,V,"Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not"
8344,V,"But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light."
8345,V,"""Benedicite!"" murmured the priest, in tones of compassion."
8346,V,"More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents"
8347,V,"Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,"
8348,V,"Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow."
8349,V,"Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,"
8350,V,Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them
8351,V,"Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals."
8352,V,"Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence."
8353,V,
8354,V,"Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red"
8355,V,"Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon"
8356,V,"Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,"
8357,V,"Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together."
8358,V,"Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,"
8359,V,"Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead."
8360,V,"Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were"
8361,V,"Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr."
8362,V,"Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,"
8363,V,"Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops"
8364,V,Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.
8365,V,
8366,V,These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.
8367,V,"Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,"
8368,V,"""We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pre!"""
8369,V,"Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,"
8370,V,Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle
8371,V,"Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted."
8372,V,"Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments"
8373,V,"Far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the Nebraska,"
8374,V,"When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,"
8375,V,Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.
8376,V,"Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses"
8377,V,"Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows."
8378,V,
8379,V,"Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden"
8380,V,Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;
8381,V,"And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,"
8382,V,"Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the sea-shore"
8383,V,"Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed."
8384,V,"Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden"
8385,V,"Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror."
8386,V,"Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom."
8387,V,"Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber;"
8388,V,"And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her."
8389,V,"Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her,"
8390,V,"Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion."
8391,V,"Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,"
8392,V,"Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her,"
8393,V,And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses.
8394,V,"Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people,--"
8395,V,"""Let us bury him here by the sea.  When a happier season"
8396,V,"Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,"
8397,V,"Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard."""
8398,V,"Such were the words of the priest.  And there in haste by the sea-side,"
8399,V,"Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,"
8400,V,"But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pre."
8401,V,"And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,"
8402,V,"Lo! with a mournful sound, like the voice of a vast congregation,"
8403,V,"Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges."
8404,V,"'T was the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean,"
8405,V,"With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward."
8406,V,Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking;
8407,V,"And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,"
8408,V,"Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins."

8416,I,"Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pre,"
8417,I,"When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,"
8418,I,"Bearing a nation, with all its household gods, into exile."
8419,I,"Exile without an end, and without an example in story."
8420,I,"Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed;"
8421,I,"Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast"
8422,I,Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.
8423,I,"Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city,"
8424,I,"From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas,--"
8425,I,From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters
8426,I,"Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean,"
8427,I,Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.
8428,I,"Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken,"
8429,I,"Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside."
8430,I,Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.
8431,I,"Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,"
8432,I,"Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things."
8433,I,"Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended,"
8434,I,"Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway"
8435,I,"Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,"
8436,I,"Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned,"
8437,I,As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert is marked by
8438,I,"Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine."
8439,I,"Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished;"
8440,I,"As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine,"
8441,I,"Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly descended"
8442,I,"Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen."
8443,I,"Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her,"
8444,I,"Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit,"
8445,I,She would commence again her endless search and endeavor;
8446,I,"Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,"
8447,I,"Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom"
8448,I,"He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him."
8449,I,"Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper,"
8450,I,Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward.
8451,I,"Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,"
8452,I,"But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten."
8453,I,"""Gabriel Lajeunesse!"" they said; ""yes! we have seen him."
8454,I,"He was with Basil the blacksmith, and both have gone to the prairies;"
8455,I,"Coureurs-des-Bois are they, and famous hunters and trappers."""
8456,I,"""Gabriel Lajeunesse!"" said others; ""O yes! we have seen him."
8457,I,"He is a Voyageur in the lowlands of Louisiana."""
8458,I,"Then would they say, ""Dear child! why dream and wait for him longer?"
8459,I,Are there not other youths as fair as Gabriel? others
8460,I,"Who have hearts as tender and true, and spirits as loyal?"
8461,I,"Here is Baptiste Leblanc, the notary's son, who has loved thee"
8462,I,"Many a tedious year; come, give him thy hand and be happy!"
8463,I,"Thou art too fair to be left to braid St. Catherine's tresses."""
8464,I,"Then would Evangeline answer, serenely but sadly, ""I cannot!"
8465,I,"Whither my heart has gone, there follows my hand, and not elsewhere."
8466,I,"For when the heart goes before, like a lamp, and illumines the pathway,"
8467,I,"Many things are made clear, that else lie hidden in darkness."""
8468,I,"Thereupon the priest, her friend and father-confessor,"
8469,I,"Said, with a smile, ""O daughter! thy God thus speaketh within thee!"
8470,I,"Talk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;"
8471,I,"If it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning"
8472,I,"Back to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment;"
8473,I,That which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain.
8474,I,Patience; accomplish thy labor; accomplish thy work of affection!
8475,I,"Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike."
8476,I,"Therefore accomplish thy labor of love, till the heart is made godlike,"
8477,I,"Purified, strengthened, perfected, and rendered more worthy of heaven!"""
8478,I,"Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline labored and waited."
8479,I,"Still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean,"
8480,I,"But with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered, ""Despair not?"""
8481,I,Thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
8482,I,"Bleeding, barefooted, over the shards and thorns of existence."
8483,I,"Let me essay, O Muse! to follow the wanderer's footsteps;--"
8484,I,"Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence;"
8485,I,But as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley:
8486,I,"Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water"
8487,I,"Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only;"
8488,I,"Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it,"
8489,I,"Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur;"
8490,I,"Happy, at length, if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet."

8501,II,"Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,"
8502,II,Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;
8503,II,"Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,"

8505,II,"On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas."
8506,II,"With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician."
8507,II,"Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,"

8509,II,"Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders."
8510,II,"Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike"
8511,II,"Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current,"
8512,II,"Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars"
8513,II,"Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin,"
8514,II,"Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded."
8515,II,"Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river,"
8516,II,"Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of luxuriant gardens,"
8517,II,"Stood the houses of planters, with negro-cabins and dove-cots."
8518,II,"They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,"
8519,II,"Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron,"
8520,II,Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.
8521,II,"They, too, swerved from their course; and, entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,"
8522,II,"Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,"
8523,II,"Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction."
8524,II,Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
8525,II,"Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air"
8526,II,Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.
8527,II,"Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons"
8528,II,"Home to their roasts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,"
8529,II,"Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter."
8530,II,"Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,"
8531,II,"Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,"
8532,II,Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.
8533,II,"Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;"
8534,II,"And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,--"
8535,II,"Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed."
8536,II,"As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,"
8537,II,"Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,"
8538,II,"So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,"
8539,II,"Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it."
8540,II,"But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly"
8541,II,"Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight."
8542,II,It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.
8543,II,"Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,"
8544,II,And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.
8545,II,
8546,II,"Then in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen,"
8547,II,"And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure"
8548,II,"Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle."
8549,II,"Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,"
8550,II,"Breaking the seal of silence, and giving tongues to the forest."
8551,II,Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.
8552,II,"Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,"
8553,II,"Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;"
8554,II,But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;
8555,II,"And, when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence."
8556,II,"Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,"
8557,II,"Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,"
8558,II,"Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers,"
8559,II,"While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,"
8560,II,"Far off,--indistinct,--as of wave or wind in the forest,"
8561,II,Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.
8562,II,
8563,II,Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them
8564,II,"Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya."
8565,II,Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations
8566,II,"Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus"
8567,II,Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.
8568,II,"Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,"
8569,II,"And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands,"
8570,II,"Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,"
8571,II,"Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber."
8572,II,Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.
8573,II,"Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin,"
8574,II,"Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward,"
8575,II,"Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered."
8576,II,Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.
8577,II,"Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine"
8578,II,"Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob,"
8579,II,"On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending,"
8580,II,"Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom."
8581,II,Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.
8582,II,"Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven"
8583,II,Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.
8584,II,
8585,II,"Nearer, ever nearer, among the numberless islands,"
8586,II,"Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er the water,"
8587,II,Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.
8588,II,"Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver."
8589,II,"At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn."
8590,II,"Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness"
8591,II,Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.
8592,II,"Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,"
8593,II,Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.
8594,II,"Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,"
8595,II,"But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos,"
8596,II,"So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows,"
8597,II,"All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen, were the sleepers,"
8598,II,Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.
8599,II,"Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie."
8600,II,"After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,"
8601,II,"As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden"
8602,II,"Said with a sigh to the friendly priest, ""O Father Felician!"
8603,II,Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.
8604,II,"Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?"
8605,II,"Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?"""
8606,II,"Then, with a blush, she added, ""Alas for my credulous fancy!"
8607,II,"Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning."""
8608,II,"But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,--"
8609,II,"""Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning."
8610,II,Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface
8611,II,"Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden."
8612,II,"Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions."
8613,II,"Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the southward,"
8614,II,"On the banks of the Teche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin."
8615,II,"There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,"
8616,II,There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.
8617,II,"Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;"
8618,II,"Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens"
8619,II,"Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest."
8620,II,"They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana."""
8621,II,
8622,II,With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.
8623,II,Softly the evening came.  The sun from the western horizon
8624,II,Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;
8625,II,Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest
8626,II,"Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together."
8627,II,"Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,"
8628,II,"Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water."
8629,II,Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.
8630,II,"Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling"
8631,II,"Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her."
8632,II,"Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,"
8633,II,"Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,"
8634,II,"Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,"
8635,II,That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.
8636,II,Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then soaring to madness
8637,II,Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.
8638,II,"Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation;"
8639,II,"Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,"
8640,II,"As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops"
8641,II,Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.
8642,II,"With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,"
8643,II,"Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,"
8644,II,"And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,"
8645,II,Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;--
8646,II,"Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle."
8647,II,
8648,III,III
8649,III,
8650,III,"Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks, from whose branches"
8651,III,"Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,"
8652,III,"Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,"
8653,III,"Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman.  A garden"
8654,III,"Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,"
8655,III,Filling the air with fragrance.  The house itself was of timbers
8656,III,"Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together."
8657,III,"Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,"
8658,III,"Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,"
8659,III,"Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it."
8660,III,"At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,"
8661,III,"Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol,"
8662,III,"Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals."
8663,III,Silence reigned o'er the place.  The line of shadow and sunshine
8664,III,"Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,"
8665,III,"And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding"
8666,III,"Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose."
8667,III,"In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway"
8668,III,"Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,"
8669,III,Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.
8670,III,"Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas"
8671,III,"Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,"
8672,III,"Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines."
8673,III,
8674,III,"Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,"
8675,III,"Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,"
8676,III,"Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin."
8677,III,Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero
8678,III,"Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master."
8679,III,"Round about him were numberless herds of kine, that were grazing"
8680,III,"Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness"
8681,III,"That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape."
8682,III,"Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding"
8683,III,"Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded"
8684,III,"Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening."
8685,III,Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
8686,III,Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.
8687,III,"Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,"
8688,III,"And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance."
8689,III,"Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden"
8690,III,Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.
8691,III,"Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward"
8692,III,Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;
8693,III,"When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith."
8694,III,"Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden."
8695,III,There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
8696,III,"Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,"
8697,III,"Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful."
8698,III,"Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings"
8699,III,"Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,"
8700,III,"Broke the silence and said, ""If you came by the Atchafalaya,"
8701,III,"How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?"""
8702,III,Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.
8703,III,"Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,"
8704,III,"""Gone? is Gabriel gone?"" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,"
8705,III,"All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented."
8706,III,"Then the good Basil said,--and his voice grew blithe as he said it,--"
8707,III,"""Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed."
8708,III,Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.
8709,III,"Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit"
8710,III,Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.
8711,III,"Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,"
8712,III,"Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,"
8713,III,"He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,"
8714,III,"Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him"
8715,III,Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.
8716,III,"Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,"
8717,III,"Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver."
8718,III,Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;
8719,III,"He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him."
8720,III,"Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning"
8721,III,"We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison."""
8722,III,
8723,III,"Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,"
8724,III,"Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler."
8725,III,"Long under Basil's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus,"
8726,III,Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.
8727,III,Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.
8728,III,"""Long live Michael,"" they cried, ""our brave Acadian minstrel!"""
8729,III,As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway
8730,III,"Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man"
8731,III,"Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,"
8732,III,"Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,"
8733,III,"Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters."
8734,III,"Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith,"
8735,III,"All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;"
8736,III,"Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,"
8737,III,And of the prairie; whose numberless herds were his who would take them;
8738,III,"Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise."
8739,III,"Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,"
8740,III,"Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil"
8741,III,Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.
8742,III,
8743,III,Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.
8744,III,"All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,"
8745,III,"Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,"
8746,III,"Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight."
8747,III,"Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman"
8748,III,Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.
8749,III,"Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,"
8750,III,"Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:--"
8751,III,"""Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,"
8752,III,"Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!"
8753,III,Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;
8754,III,Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer.
8755,III,"Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water."
8756,III,All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom; and grass grows
8757,III,More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.
8758,III,"Here, too, numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies;"
8759,III,"Here, too, lands may be had for the asking, and forests of timber"
8760,III,With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.
8761,III,"After your houses are built, and your fields are yellow with harvests,"
8762,III,"No King George of England shall drive you away from your homesteads,"
8763,III,"Burning your dwellings and barns, and stealing your farms and your cattle."""
8764,III,"Speaking these words, he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils,"
8765,III,"While his huge, brown hand came thundering down on the table,"
8766,III,"So that the guests all started; and Father Felician, astounded,"
8767,III,"Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils."
8768,III,"But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:--"
8769,III,"""Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!"
8770,III,"For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,"
8771,III,"Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!"""
8772,III,"Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching"
8773,III,Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.
8774,III,"It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,"
8775,III,Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman.
8776,III,Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:
8777,III,"Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,"
8778,III,"Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,"
8779,III,Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.
8780,III,"But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding"
8781,III,"From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,"
8782,III,"Broke up all further speech.  Away, like children delighted,"
8783,III,"All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening"
8784,III,"Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music,"
8785,III,"Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments."
8786,III,
8787,III,"Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman"
8788,III,"Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;"
8789,III,"While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her"
8790,III,"Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music"
8791,III,"Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness"
8792,III,"Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden."
8793,III,"Beautiful was the night.  Behind the black wall of the forest,"
8794,III,"Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon.  On the river"
8795,III,"Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,"
8796,III,Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.
8797,III,"Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden"
8798,III,"Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions"
8799,III,"Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian."
8800,III,"Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,"
8801,III,Hung the heart of the maiden.  The calm and the magical moonlight
8802,III,Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing;
8803,III,"As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,"
8804,III,Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.
8805,III,"Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies"
8806,III,Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.
8807,III,"Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,"
8808,III,"Shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,"
8809,III,"Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,"
8810,III,"As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, ""Upharsin."""
8811,III,"And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,"
8812,III,"Wandered alone, and she cried, ""O Gabriel!  O my beloved!"
8813,III,"Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?"
8814,III,"Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?"
8815,III,Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!
8816,III,Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!
8817,III,"Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,"
8818,III,Thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers!
8819,III,"When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?"""
8820,III,Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
8821,III,"Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets,"
8822,III,Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.
8823,III,"""Patience!"" whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness:"
8824,III,"And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, ""To-morrow!"""
8825,III,
8826,III,Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden
8827,III,"Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses"
8828,III,With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.
8829,III,"""Farewell!"" said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;"
8830,III,"""See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,"
8831,III,"And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming."""
8832,III,"""Farewell!"" answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended"
8833,III,"Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting."
8834,III,"Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,"
8835,III,"Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,"
8836,III,Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.
8837,III,"Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,"
8838,III,"Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,"
8839,III,"Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain"
8840,III,Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate Country;
8841,III,"Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,"
8842,III,"Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord,"
8843,III,"That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,"
8844,III,"Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies."
8845,III,
8846,III,
8847,III,
8848,IV,IV
8849,IV,
8850,IV,"Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains"
8851,IV,"Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits."
8852,IV,"Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway,"
8853,IV,"Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,"
8854,IV,Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee.
8855,IV,"Eastward, with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains,"
8856,IV,Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska;
8857,IV,"And to the south, from Fontaine-qui-bout and the Spanish sierras,"
8858,IV,"Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert,"
8859,IV,"Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean,"
8860,IV,"Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations."
8861,IV,"Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies,"
8862,IV,"Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,"
8863,IV,Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.
8864,IV,"Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk and the roebuck;"
8865,IV,"Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;"
8866,IV,"Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;"
8867,IV,"Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,"
8868,IV,Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails
8869,IV,"Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,"
8870,IV,"Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,"
8871,IV,By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.
8872,IV,Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;
8873,IV,Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;
8874,IV,"And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,"
8875,IV,"Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,"
8876,IV,"And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,"
8877,IV,Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.
8878,IV,
8879,IV,"Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains,"
8880,IV,"Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him."
8881,IV,"Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil"
8882,IV,"Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him."
8883,IV,"Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire"
8884,IV,"Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,"
8885,IV,"When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes."
8886,IV,"And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,"
8887,IV,"Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana"
8888,IV,"Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them."
8889,IV,
8890,IV,"Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered"
8891,IV,"Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features"
8892,IV,"Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow."
8893,IV,"She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,"
8894,IV,"From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,"
8895,IV,"Where her Canadian husband, a Coureur-des-Bois, had been murdered."
8896,IV,"Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome"
8897,IV,"Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them"
8898,IV,On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.
8899,IV,"But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,"
8900,IV,"Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,"
8901,IV,"Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light"
8902,IV,"Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets"
8903,IV,Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated
8904,IV,"Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,"
8905,IV,"All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses."
8906,IV,"Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another"
8907,IV,Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.
8908,IV,"Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,"
8909,IV,"Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,"
8910,IV,She in turn related her love and all its disasters.
8911,IV,"Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended"
8912,IV,"Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror"
8913,IV,"Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;"
8914,IV,"Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden,"
8915,IV,"But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,"
8916,IV,"Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,"
8917,IV,"Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest."
8918,IV,"Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,"
8919,IV,"Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,"
8920,IV,"That, through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,"
8921,IV,"Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,"
8922,IV,"Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,"
8923,IV,"And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people."
8924,IV,"Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened"
8925,IV,"To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her"
8926,IV,"Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress."
8927,IV,"Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,"
8928,IV,"Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor"
8929,IV,"Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland."
8930,IV,"With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches"
8931,IV,Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.
8932,IV,"Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,"
8933,IV,"Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,"
8934,IV,"As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow."
8935,IV,It was no earthly fear.  A breath from the region of spirits
8936,IV,Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment
8937,IV,"That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom."
8938,IV,"With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished."
8939,IV,
8940,IV,Early upon the morrow the march was resumed; and the Shawnee
8941,IV,"Said, as they journeyed along, ""On the western slope of these mountains"
8942,IV,Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.
8943,IV,"Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;"
8944,IV,"Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him."""
8945,IV,"Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,"
8946,IV,"""Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!"""
8947,IV,"Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,"
8948,IV,"Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,"
8949,IV,"And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,"
8950,IV,"Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission."
8951,IV,"Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,"
8952,IV,Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children.  A crucifix fastened
8953,IV,"High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines,"
8954,IV,Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.
8955,IV,"This was their rural chapel.  Aloft, through the intricate arches"
8956,IV,"Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,"
8957,IV,Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.
8958,IV,"Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,"
8959,IV,"Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions."
8960,IV,"But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen"
8961,IV,"Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower,"
8962,IV,"Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them"
8963,IV,"Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression,"
8964,IV,"Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest,"
8965,IV,"And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam."
8966,IV,"There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on cakes of the maize-ear"
8967,IV,"Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher."
8968,IV,Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered:--
8969,IV,"""Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated"
8970,IV,"On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes,"
8971,IV,"Told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey!"""
8972,IV,"Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness;"
8973,IV,But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes
8974,IV,Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.
8975,IV,"""Far to the north he has gone,"" continued the priest; ""but in autumn,"
8976,IV,"When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission."""
8977,IV,"Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive,"
8978,IV,"""Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted."""
8979,IV,"So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,"
8980,IV,"Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions."
8981,IV,"Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission."
8982,IV,
8983,IV,"Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other,--"
8984,IV,Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing
8985,IV,"Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving above her,"
8986,IV,"Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming"
8987,IV,Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels.
8988,IV,"Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens"
8989,IV,"Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover,"
8990,IV,"But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the corn-field."
8991,IV,Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.
8992,IV,"""Patience!"" the priest would say; ""have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!"
8993,IV,"Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,"
8994,IV,"See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;"
8995,IV,"This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted"
8996,IV,"Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller's journey"
8997,IV,"Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert."
8998,IV,"Such in the soul of man is faith.  The blossoms of passion,"
8999,IV,"Gay and luxuriant flowers, are brighter and fuller of fragrance,"
9000,IV,"But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odor is deadly."
9001,IV,"Only this humble plant can guide us here, and hereafter"
9002,IV,"Crown us with asphodel flowers, that are wet with the dews of nepenthe."""
9003,IV,
9004,IV,"So came the autumn, and passed, and the winter,--yet Gabriel came not;"
9005,IV,"Blossomed the opening spring, and the notes of the robin and bluebird"
9006,IV,"Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not."
9007,IV,But on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
9008,IV,"Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odor of blossom."
9009,IV,"Far to the north and east, it said, in the Michigan forests,"
9010,IV,"Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw River,"
9011,IV,"And, with returning guides, that sought the lakes of St. Lawrence,"
9012,IV,"Saying a sad farewell, Evangeline went from the Mission."
9013,IV,"When over weary ways, by long and perilous marches,"
9014,IV,"She had attained at length the depths of the Michigan forests,"
9015,IV,Found she the hunter's lodge deserted and fallen to ruin!
9016,IV,
9017,IV,"Thus did the long sad years glide on, and in seasons and places"
9018,IV,Divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden;--
9019,IV,"Now in the Tents of Grace of the meek Moravian Missions,"
9020,IV,"Now in the noisy camps and the battle-fields of the army,"
9021,IV,"Now in secluded hamlets, in towns and populous cities."
9022,IV,"Like a phantom she came, and passed away unremembered."
9023,IV,"Fair was she and young, when in hope began the long journey;"
9024,IV,"Faded was she and old, when in disappointment it ended."
9025,IV,"Each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty,"
9026,IV,"Leaving behind it, broader and deeper, the gloom and the shadow."
9027,IV,"Then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray o'er her forehead,"
9028,IV,"Dawn of another life, that broke o'er her earthy horizon,"
9029,IV,As in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning.
9030,IV,
9031,IV,
9032,IV,
9033,V,V
9034,V,
9035,V,"In that delightful land which is washed by the Delaware's waters,"
9036,V,"Guarding in sylvan shades the name of Penn the apostle,"
9037,V,Stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded.
9038,V,"There all the air is balm, and the peach is the emblem of beauty,"
9039,V,"And the streets still re-echo the names of the trees of the forest,"
9040,V,As if they fain would appease the Dryads whose haunts they molested.
9041,V,"There from the troubled sea had Evangeline landed, an exile,"
9042,V,Finding among the children of Penn a home and a country.
9043,V,"There old Rene Leblanc had died; and when he departed,"
9044,V,Saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants.
9045,V,"Something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city,"
9046,V,"Something that spake to her heart, and made her no longer a stranger;"
9047,V,"And her ear was pleased with the Thee and Thou of the Quakers,"
9048,V,"For it recalled the past, the old Acadian country,"
9049,V,"Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters."
9050,V,"So, when the fruitless search, the disappointed endeavor,"
9051,V,"Ended, to recommence no more upon earth, uncomplaining,"
9052,V,"Thither, as leaves to the light, were turned her thoughts and her footsteps."
9053,V,As from a mountain's top the rainy mists of the morning
9054,V,"Roll away, and afar we behold the landscape below us,"
9055,V,"Sun-illumined, with shining rivers and cities and hamlets,"
9056,V,"So fell the mists from her mind, and she saw the world far below her,"
9057,V,"Dark no longer, but all illumined with love; and the pathway"
9058,V,"Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance."
9059,V,"Gabriel was not forgotten.  Within her heart was his image,"
9060,V,"Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,"
9061,V,Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.
9062,V,"Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not."
9063,V,"Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;"
9064,V,"He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;"
9065,V,"Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,"
9066,V,This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.
9067,V,"So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,"
9068,V,"Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma."
9069,V,"Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow"
9070,V,"Meekly, with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour."
9071,V,Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting
9072,V,"Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,"
9073,V,"Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,"
9074,V,Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.
9075,V,"Night after night, when the world was asleep, as the watchman repeated"
9076,V,"Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,"
9077,V,High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.
9078,V,"Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs"
9079,V,"Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market,"
9080,V,"Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings."
9081,V,
9082,V,"Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,"
9083,V,"Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,"
9084,V,"Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn."
9085,V,"And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,"
9086,V,"Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,"
9087,V,"So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its natural margin,"
9088,V,"Spread to a brackish lake, the silver stream of existence."
9089,V,"Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;"
9090,V,But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;--
9091,V,"Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,"
9092,V,"Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless."
9093,V,"Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;"
9094,V,"Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket"
9095,V,"Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble walls seem to echo"
9096,V,"Softly the words of the Lord:--""The poor ye always have with you."""
9097,V,"Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy.  The dying"
9098,V,"Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there"
9099,V,"Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,"
9100,V,"Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,"
9101,V,Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance.
9102,V,"Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,"
9103,V,Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.
9104,V,
9105,V,"Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,"
9106,V,"Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse."
9107,V,Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden;
9108,V,"And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,"
9109,V,That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.
9110,V,"Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridors, cooled by the east-wind,"
9111,V,"Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,"
9112,V,"While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted"
9113,V,"Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco."
9114,V,Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit;
9115,V,"Something within her said, ""At length thy trials are ended"";"
9116,V,"And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness."
9117,V,"Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,"
9118,V,"Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence"
9119,V,"Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,"
9120,V,"Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside."
9121,V,"Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,"
9122,V,"Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence"
9123,V,Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.
9124,V,"And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,"
9125,V,"Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever."
9126,V,Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;
9127,V,"Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers."
9128,V,
9129,V,"Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,"
9130,V,"Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart, while a shudder"
9131,V,"Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,"
9132,V,And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.
9133,V,"Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,"
9134,V,"That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows."
9135,V,On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.
9136,V,"Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples;"
9137,V,"But, as he lay in the in morning light, his face for a moment"
9138,V,Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood;
9139,V,So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.
9140,V,"Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,"
9141,V,"As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals,"
9142,V,"That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over."
9143,V,"Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted"
9144,V,"Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,"
9145,V,"Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking."
9146,V,"Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,"
9147,V,"Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded"
9148,V,"Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like,"
9149,V,"""Gabriel!  O my beloved!"" and died away into silence."
9150,V,"Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;"
9151,V,"Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,"
9152,V,"Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow,"
9153,V,"As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision."
9154,V,"Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,"
9155,V,"Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside."
9156,V,"Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered"
9157,V,"Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken."
9158,V,"Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,"
9159,V,"Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom."
9160,V,"Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,"
9161,V,As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.
9162,V,
9163,V,"All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,"
9164,V,"All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,"
9165,V,"All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!"
9166,V,"And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,"
9167,V,"Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, ""Father, I thank thee!"""
9168,V,

9171,V,"Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow,"
9172,V,"Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping."
9173,V,"Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,"
9174,V,"In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed."
9175,V,"Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,"
9176,V,"Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and forever,"
9177,V,"Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,"
9178,V,"Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labors,"
9179,V,"Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey!"
9180,V,
9181,V,Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches
9182,V,"Dwells another race, with other customs and language."
9183,V,Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic
9184,V,"Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile"
9185,V,Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.
9186,V,In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy;
9187,V,"Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,"
9188,V,"And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story,"
9189,V,"While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean"
9190,V,"Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest."

9334,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The sun was rising o'er the sea,"

9378,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Standing before
9379,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Her father's door,"
9380,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,He saw the form of his promised bride.
9381,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The sun shone on her golden hair,"
9382,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair,"
9383,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,With the breath of morn and the soft sea air.
9384,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Like a beauteous barge was she,"
9385,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Still at rest on the sandy beach,"
9386,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Just beyond the billow's reach;
9387,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,But he
9388,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Was the restless, seething, stormy sea!"

9391,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"It is the heart, and not the brain,"

9394,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Far excelleth all the rest!
9395,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9396,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Thus with the rising of the sun
9397,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Was the noble task begun
9398,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds
9399,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Were heard the intermingled sounds
9400,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Of axes and of mallets, plied"
9401,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,With vigorous arms on every side;
9402,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Plied so deftly and so well,"
9403,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"That, ere the shadows of evening fell,"
9404,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The keel of oak for a noble ship,"
9405,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong"
9406,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Was lying ready, and stretched along"
9407,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The blocks, well placed upon the slip."
9408,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Happy, thrice happy, every one"
9409,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Who sees his labor well begun,"
9410,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And not perplexed and multiplied,"
9411,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,By idly waiting for time and tide!
9412,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9413,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And when the hot, long day was o'er,"
9414,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,The young man at the Master's door
9415,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Sat with the maiden calm and still.
9416,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And within the porch, a little more"
9417,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Removed beyond the evening chill,"
9418,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The father sat, and told them tales"
9419,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Of wrecks in the great September gales,"
9420,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main,"
9421,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And ships that never came back again,"
9422,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The chance and change of a sailor's life,"
9423,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Want and plenty, rest and strife,"
9424,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"His roving fancy, like the wind,"
9425,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"That nothing can stay and nothing can bind,"
9426,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And the magic charm of foreign lands,"
9427,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With shadows of palms, and shining sands,"
9428,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Where the tumbling surf,"
9429,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar,"
9430,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar,"
9431,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,As he lies alone and asleep on the turf.
9432,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And the trembling maiden held her breath
9433,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea,"
9434,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With all its terror and mystery,"
9435,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death,"
9436,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,That divides and yet unites mankind!
9437,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And whenever the old man paused, a gleam"
9438,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume
9439,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The silent group in the twilight gloom,"
9440,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And thoughtful faces, as in a dream;"
9441,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And for a moment one might mark
9442,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"What had been hidden by the dark,"
9443,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"That the head of the maiden lay at rest,"
9444,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Tenderly, on the young man's breast!"
9445,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9446,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Day by day the vessel grew,"
9447,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With timbers fashioned strong and true,"
9448,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee,"
9449,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Till, framed with perfect symmetry,"
9450,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,A skeleton ship rose up to view!
9451,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And around the bows and along the side
9452,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The heavy hammers and mallets plied,"
9453,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Till after many a week, at length,"
9454,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Wonderful for form and strength,"
9455,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Sublime in its enormous bulk,"
9456,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk!
9457,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And around it columns of smoke, up-wreathing."
9458,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething"
9459,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Caldron, that glowed,"
9460,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And overflowed
9461,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With the black tar, heated for the sheathing."
9462,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And amid the clamors
9463,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Of clattering hammers,"
9464,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,He who listened heard now and then
9465,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,The song of the Master and his men:--
9466,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9467,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"""Build me straight, O worthy Master."
9468,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel,"

9471,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9472,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With oaken brace and copper band,"
9473,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Lay the rudder on the sand,"

9475,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Over the movement of the whole;
9476,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And near it the anchor, whose giant hand"
9477,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Would reach down and grapple with the land,"
9478,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And immovable and fast
9479,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast!
9480,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And at the bows an image stood,"
9481,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"By a cunning artist carved in wood,"
9482,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With robes of white, that far behind"
9483,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Seemed to be fluttering in the wind.
9484,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"It was not shaped in a classic mould,"
9485,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old,"
9486,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Or Naiad rising from the water,"

9488,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"On many a dreary and misty night,"
9489,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light,"
9490,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Speeding along through the rain and the dark,"

9493,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Guiding the vessel, in its flight,"
9494,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,By a path none other knows aright!
9495,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Behold, at last,"
9496,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Each tall and tapering mast
9497,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Is swung into its place;
9498,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Shrouds and stays
9499,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Holding it firm and fast!

9501,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Long ago,"

9504,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Lay the snow,"
9505,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"They fell,--those lordly pines!"
9506,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Those grand, majestic pines!"
9507,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,'Mid shouts and cheers
9508,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The jaded steers,"

9519,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9520,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And everywhere
9521,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The slender, graceful spars"
9522,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Poise aloft in the air,"
9523,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And at the mast-head,"
9524,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"White, blue, and red,"
9525,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,A flag unrolls the stripes and stars.
9526,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless,"

9533,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,All is finished! and at length
9534,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Has come the bridal day
9535,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Of beauty and of strength.
9536,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,To-day the vessel shall be launched!

9544,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled,"
9545,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Paces restless to and fro,"
9546,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Up and down the sands of gold.
9547,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,His beating heart is not at rest;
9548,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"And far and wide,"
9549,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"With ceaseless flow,"
9550,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,His beard of snow
9551,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Heaves with the heaving of his breast.
9552,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,He waits impatient for his bride.
9553,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"There she stands,"

9555,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Decked with flags and streamers gay,"
9556,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"In honor of her marriage day,"
9557,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending,"
9558,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Round her like a veil descending,"
9559,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Ready to be

9561,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9562,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,On the deck another bride

9568,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,
9569,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The prayer is said,"
9570,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"The service read,"
9571,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,The joyous bridegroom bows his head;
9572,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And in tear's the good old Master
9573,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Shakes the brown hand of his son,"
9574,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek
9575,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"In silence, for he cannot speak,"
9576,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,And ever faster

9584,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,"Words of warning, words of cheer,"
9585,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,But tedious to the bridegroom's ear.
9586,THE BUILDING OF THE SHIP,He knew the chart

10373,PEGASUS IN POUND,"It was Autumn, and incessant"
10374,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Piped the quails from shocks and sheaves,"
10375,PEGASUS IN POUND,"And, like living coals, the apples"
10376,PEGASUS IN POUND,Burned among the withering leaves.
10377,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10378,PEGASUS IN POUND,Loud the clamorous bell was ringing
10379,PEGASUS IN POUND,From its belfry gaunt and grim;
10380,PEGASUS IN POUND,"'T was the daily call to labor,"
10381,PEGASUS IN POUND,Not a triumph meant for him.
10382,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10383,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Not the less he saw the landscape,"
10384,PEGASUS IN POUND,In its gleaming vapor veiled;

10387,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10388,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Thus, upon the village common,"

10392,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10393,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Then the sombre village crier,"
10394,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Ringing loud his brazen bell,"
10395,PEGASUS IN POUND,Wandered down the street proclaiming
10396,PEGASUS IN POUND,There was an estray to sell.
10397,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10398,PEGASUS IN POUND,"And the curious country people,"
10399,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Rich and poor, and young and old,"
10400,PEGASUS IN POUND,Came in haste to see this wondrous

10402,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10403,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Thus the day passed, and the evening"

10405,PEGASUS IN POUND,"But it brought no food nor shelter,"
10406,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Brought no straw nor stall, for him."
10407,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10408,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Patiently, and still expectant,"
10409,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Looked he through the wooden bars,"
10410,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Saw the moon rise o'er the landscape,"
10411,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Saw the tranquil, patient stars;"
10412,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10413,PEGASUS IN POUND,Till at length the bell at midnight
10414,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Sounded from its dark abode,"
10415,PEGASUS IN POUND,"And, from out a neighboring farm-yard"
10416,PEGASUS IN POUND,Loud the cock Alectryon crowed.
10417,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10418,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Then, with nostrils wide distended,"
10419,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Breaking from his iron chain,"
10420,PEGASUS IN POUND,"And unfolding far his pinions,"
10421,PEGASUS IN POUND,To those stars he soared again.
10422,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10423,PEGASUS IN POUND,"On the morrow, when the village"
10424,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Woke to all its toil and care,"
10425,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Lo! the strange steed had departed,"
10426,PEGASUS IN POUND,And they knew not when nor where.
10427,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10428,PEGASUS IN POUND,"But they found, upon the greensward"
10429,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Where his straggling hoofs had trod,"
10430,PEGASUS IN POUND,"Pure and bright, a fountain flowing"
10431,PEGASUS IN POUND,From the hoof-marks in the sod.
10432,PEGASUS IN POUND,
10433,PEGASUS IN POUND,"From that hour, the fount unfailing"

10781,THE PEACE-PIPE,From the red stone of the quarry
10782,THE PEACE-PIPE,"With his hand he broke a fragment,"

10787,THE PEACE-PIPE,With its dark green leaves upon it;
10788,THE PEACE-PIPE,"Filled the pipe with bark of willow,"
10789,THE PEACE-PIPE,With the bark of the red willow;
10790,THE PEACE-PIPE,"Breathed upon the neighboring forest,"
10791,THE PEACE-PIPE,"Made its great boughs chafe together,"

10795,THE PEACE-PIPE,"Smoked the calumet, the Peace-Pipe,"
10796,THE PEACE-PIPE,As a signal to the nations.
10797,THE PEACE-PIPE,"And the smoke rose slowly, slowly,"
10798,THE PEACE-PIPE,"Through the tranquil air of morning,"
10799,THE PEACE-PIPE,"First a single line of darkness,"

10845,THE PEACE-PIPE,"The creator of the nations,"
10846,THE PEACE-PIPE,"Looked upon them with compassion,"
10847,THE PEACE-PIPE,With paternal love and pity;
10848,THE PEACE-PIPE,Looked upon their wrath and wrangling
10849,THE PEACE-PIPE,"But as quarrels among children,"
10850,THE PEACE-PIPE,But as feuds and fights of children!

10936,II,"""Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"""
10937,II,"Cried the warriors, cried the old men,"
10938,II,When he came in triumph homeward
10939,II,"With the sacred Belt of Wampum,"
10940,II,"From the regions of the North-Wind,"
10941,II,"From the kingdom of Wabasso,"
10942,II,From the land of the White Rabbit.
10943,II,He had stolen the Belt of Wampum
10944,II,"From the neck of Mishe-Mokwa,"
10945,II,"From the Great Bear of the mountains,"
10946,II,"From the terror of the nations,"
10947,II,As he lay asleep and cumbrous
10948,II,"On the summit of the mountains,"
10949,II,"Like a rock with mosses on it,"
10950,II,Spotted brown and gray with mosses.
10951,II,"Silently he stole upon him,"
10952,II,Till the red nails of the monster
10953,II,"Almost touched him, almost scared him,"
10954,II,Till the hot breath of his nostrils
10955,II,"Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis,"
10956,II,As he drew the Belt of Wampum
10957,II,"Over the round ears, that heard not,"
10958,II,"Over the small eyes, that saw not,"
10959,II,"Over the long nose and nostrils,"
10960,II,"The black muffle of the nostrils,"
10961,II,Out of which the heavy breathing
10962,II,Warmed the hands of Mudjekeewis.
10963,II,"Then he swung aloft his war-club,"
10964,II,"Shouted loud and long his war-cry,"
10965,II,Smote the mighty Mishe-Mokwa
10966,II,"In the middle of the forehead,"
10967,II,Right between the eyes he smote him.
10968,II,"With the heavy blow bewildered,"
10969,II,Rose the Great Bear of the mountains;
10970,II,"But his knees beneath him trembled,"
10971,II,"And he whimpered like a woman,"
10972,II,"As he reeled and staggered forward,"
10973,II,As he sat upon his haunches;
10974,II,"And the mighty Mudjekeewis,"
10975,II,"Standing fearlessly before him,"
10976,II,"Taunted him in loud derision,"
10977,II,Spake disdainfully in this wise:--
10978,II,"""Hark you, Bear! you are a coward;"
10979,II,"And no Brave, as you pretended;"
10980,II,Else you would not cry and whimper
10981,II,Like a miserable woman!
10982,II,"Bear! you know our tribes are hostile,"
10983,II,Long have been at war together;
10984,II,"Now you find that we are strongest,"
10985,II,"You go sneaking in the forest,"
10986,II,You go hiding in the mountains!
10987,II,Had you conquered me in battle
10988,II,Not a groan would I have uttered;
10989,II,"But you, Bear! sit here and whimper,"
10990,II,"And disgrace your tribe by crying,"
10991,II,"Like a wretched Shaugodaya,"
10992,II,"Like a cowardly old woman!"""
10993,II,"Then again he raised his war-club,"
10994,II,Smote again the Mishe-Mokwa
10995,II,"In the middle of his forehead,"
10996,II,"Broke his skull, as ice is broken"
10997,II,When one goes to fish in Winter.
10998,II,"Thus was slain the Mishe-Mokwa,"
10999,II,"He the Great Bear of the mountains,"
11000,II,He the terror of the nations.
11001,II,"""Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"""
11002,II,"With a shout exclaimed the people,"
11003,II,"""Honor be to Mudjekeewis!"
11004,II,"Henceforth he shall be the West-Wind,"
11005,II,And hereafter and forever
11006,II,Shall he hold supreme dominion
11007,II,Over all the winds of heaven.
11008,II,"Call him no more Mudjekeewis,"
11009,II,"Call him Kabeyun, the West-Wind!"""
11010,II,Thus was Mudjekeewis chosen
11011,II,Father of the Winds of Heaven.
11012,II,"For himself he kept the West-Wind,"
11013,II,Gave the others to his children;
11014,II,"Unto Wabun gave the East-Wind,"
11015,II,"Gave the South to Shawondasee,"
11016,II,"And the North-Wind, wild and cruel,"
11017,II,To the fierce Kabibonokka.
11018,II,Young and beautiful was Wabun;
11019,II,"He it was who brought the morning,"
11020,II,He it was whose silver arrows
11021,II,Chased the dark o'er hill and valley;
11022,II,He it was whose cheeks were painted
11023,II,"With the brightest streaks of crimson,"
11024,II,"And whose voice awoke the village,"
11025,II,"Called the deer, and called the hunter."
11026,II,Lonely in the sky was Wabun;
11027,II,"Though the birds sang gayly to him,"
11028,II,Though the wild-flowers of the meadow
11029,II,"Filled the air with odors for him,"
11030,II,Though the forests and the rivers
11031,II,"Sang and shouted at his coming,"
11032,II,"Still his heart was sad within him,"
11033,II,For he was alone in heaven.
11034,II,"But one morning, gazing earthward,"
11035,II,"While the village still was sleeping,"
11036,II,"And the fog lay on the river,"
11037,II,"Like a ghost, that goes at sunrise,"
11038,II,He beheld a maiden walking
11039,II,"All alone upon a meadow,"
11040,II,Gathering water-flags and rushes
11041,II,By a river in the meadow.
11042,II,"Every morning, gazing earthward,"
11043,II,Still the first thing he beheld there
11044,II,"Was her blue eyes looking at him,"
11045,II,Two blue lakes among the rushes.
11046,II,"And he loved the lonely maiden,"
11047,II,Who thus waited for his coming;
11048,II,"For they both were solitary,"
11049,II,She on earth and he in heaven.
11050,II,"And he wooed her with caresses,"
11051,II,"Wooed her with his smile of sunshine,"
11052,II,"With his flattering words he wooed her,"
11053,II,"With his sighing and his singing,"
11054,II,"Gentlest whispers in the branches,"
11055,II,"Softest music, sweetest odors,"
11056,II,"Till he drew her to his bosom,"
11057,II,"Folded in his robes of crimson,"
11058,II,"Till into a star he changed her,"
11059,II,Trembling still upon his bosom;
11060,II,And forever in the heavens
11061,II,"They are seen together walking,"
11062,II,"Wabun and the Wabun-Annung,"
11063,II,Wabun and the Star of Morning.
11064,II,But the fierce Kabibonokka
11065,II,"Had his dwelling among icebergs,"
11066,II,"In the everlasting snow-drifts,"
11067,II,"In the kingdom of Wabasso,"
11068,II,In the land of the White Rabbit.
11069,II,He it was whose hand in Autumn
11070,II,"Painted all the trees with scarlet,"
11071,II,Stained the leaves with red and yellow;
11072,II,"He it was who sent the snow-flake,"
11073,II,"Sifting, hissing through the forest,"
11074,II,"Froze the ponds, the lakes, the rivers,"
11075,II,"Drove the loon and sea-gull southward,"
11076,II,Drove the cormorant and curlew
11077,II,To their nests of sedge and sea-tang
11078,II,In the realms of Shawondasee.
11079,II,Once the fierce Kabibonokka
11080,II,Issued from his lodge of snow-drifts
11081,II,"From his home among the icebergs,"
11082,II,"And his hair, with snow besprinkled,"
11083,II,"Streamed behind him like a river,"
11084,II,"Like a black and wintry river,"
11085,II,"As he howled and hurried southward,"
11086,II,Over frozen lakes and moorlands.
11087,II,There among the reeds and rushes
11088,II,"Found he Shingebis, the diver,"
11089,II,"Trailing strings of fish behind him,"
11090,II,"O'er the frozen fens and moorlands,"
11091,II,"Lingering still among the moorlands,"
11092,II,Though his tribe had long departed
11093,II,To the land of Shawondasee.
11094,II,"Cried the fierce Kabibonokka,"
11095,II,"""Who is this that dares to brave me?"
11096,II,"Dares to stay in my dominions,"
11097,II,"When the Wawa has departed,"
11098,II,"When the wild-goose has gone southward,"
11099,II,"And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
11100,II,Long ago departed southward?
11101,II,"I will go into his wigwam,"
11102,II,"I will put his smouldering fire out!"""
11103,II,"And at night Kabibonokka,"
11104,II,"To the lodge came wild and wailing,"
11105,II,"Heaped the snow in drifts about it,"
11106,II,"Shouted down into the smoke-flue,"
11107,II,"Shook the lodge-poles in his fury,"
11108,II,Flapped the curtain of the door-way.
11109,II,"Shingebis, the diver, feared not,"
11110,II,"Shingebis, the diver, cared not;"
11111,II,"Four great logs had he for firewood,"
11112,II,"One for each moon of the winter,"
11113,II,And for food the fishes served him.
11114,II,"By his blazing fire he sat there,"
11115,II,"Warm and merry, eating, laughing,"
11116,II,"Singing, ""O Kabibonokka,"
11117,II,"You are but my fellow-mortal!"""
11118,II,"Then Kabibonokka entered,"
11119,II,"And though Shingebis, the diver,"
11120,II,"Felt his presence by the coldness,"
11121,II,"Felt his icy breath upon him,"
11122,II,"Still he did not cease his singing,"
11123,II,"Still he did not leave his laughing,"
11124,II,"Only turned the log a little,"
11125,II,"Only made the fire burn brighter,"
11126,II,Made the sparks fly up the smoke-flue.
11127,II,"From Kabibonokka's forehead,"
11128,II,"From his snow-besprinkled tresses,"
11129,II,"Drops of sweat fell fast and heavy,"
11130,II,"Making dints upon the ashes,"
11131,II,"As along the eaves of lodges,"
11132,II,"As from drooping boughs of hemlock,"
11133,II,"Drips the melting snow in spring-time,"
11134,II,Making hollows in the snow-drifts.
11135,II,"Till at last he rose defeated,"
11136,II,"Could not bear the heat and laughter,"
11137,II,"Could not bear the merry singing,"
11138,II,"But rushed headlong through the door-way,"
11139,II,"Stamped upon the crusted snow-drifts,"
11140,II,"Stamped upon the lakes and rivers,"
11141,II,"Made the snow upon them harder,"
11142,II,"Made the ice upon them thicker,"
11143,II,"Challenged Shingebis, the diver,"
11144,II,"To come forth and wrestle with him,"
11145,II,To come forth and wrestle naked
11146,II,On the frozen fens and moorlands.
11147,II,"Forth went Shingebis, the diver,"
11148,II,"Wrestled all night with the North-Wind,"
11149,II,Wrestled naked on the moorlands
11150,II,"With the fierce Kabibonokka,"
11151,II,"Till his panting breath grew fainter,"
11152,II,"Till his frozen grasp grew feebler,"
11153,II,"Till he reeled and staggered backward,"
11154,II,"And retreated, baffled, beaten,"
11155,II,"To the kingdom of Wabasso,"
11156,II,"To the land of the White Rabbit,"
11157,II,"Hearing still the gusty laughter,"
11158,II,"Hearing Shingebis, the diver,"
11159,II,"Singing, ""O Kabibonokka,"
11160,II,"You are but my fellow-mortal!"""
11161,II,"Shawondasee, fat and lazy,"
11162,II,"Had his dwelling far to southward,"
11163,II,"In the drowsy, dreamy sunshine,"
11164,II,In the never-ending Summer.
11165,II,"He it was who sent the wood-birds,"
11166,II,"Sent the robin, the Opechee,"
11167,II,"Sent the bluebird, the Owaissa,"
11168,II,"Sent the Shawshaw, sent the swallow,"
11169,II,"Sent the wild-goose, Wawa, northward,"
11170,II,"Sent the melons and tobacco,"
11171,II,And the grapes in purple clusters.
11172,II,From his pipe the smoke ascending
11173,II,"Filled the sky with haze and vapor,"
11174,II,"Filled the air with dreamy softness,"
11175,II,"Gave a twinkle to the water,"
11176,II,"Touched the rugged hills with smoothness,"
11177,II,Brought the tender Indian Summer
11178,II,"To the melancholy north-land,"
11179,II,In the dreary Moon of Snow-shoes.
11180,II,"Listless, careless Shawondasee!"
11181,II,"In his life he had one shadow,"
11182,II,In his heart one sorrow had he.
11183,II,"Once, as he was gazing northward,"
11184,II,Far away upon a prairie
11185,II,"He beheld a maiden standing,"
11186,II,Saw a tall and slender maiden
11187,II,All alone upon a prairie;
11188,II,"Brightest green were all her garments,"
11189,II,And her hair was like the sunshine.
11190,II,"Day by day he gazed upon her,"
11191,II,"Day by day he sighed with passion,"
11192,II,Day by day his heart within him
11193,II,Grew more hot with love and longing
11194,II,For the maid with yellow tresses.
11195,II,But he was too fat and lazy
11196,II,To bestir himself and woo her;
11197,II,"Yes, too indolent and easy"
11198,II,To pursue her and persuade her;
11199,II,"So he only gazed upon her,"
11200,II,Only sat and sighed with passion
11201,II,For the maiden of the prairie.
11202,II,"Till one morning, looking northward,"
11203,II,He beheld her yellow tresses
11204,II,"Changed and covered o'er with whiteness,"
11205,II,Covered as with whitest snow-flakes.
11206,II,"""Ah! my brother from the North-land,"
11207,II,"From the kingdom of Wabasso,"
11208,II,From the land of the White Rabbit!
11209,II,"You have stolen the maiden from me,"
11210,II,"You have laid your hand upon her,"
11211,II,"You have wooed and won my maiden,"
11212,II,"With your stories of the North-land!"""
11213,II,Thus the wretched Shawondasee
11214,II,Breathed into the air his sorrow;
11215,II,And the South-Wind o'er the prairie
11216,II,"Wandered warm with sighs of passion,"
11217,II,"With the sighs of Shawondasee,"
11218,II,"Till the air seemed full of snow-flakes,"
11219,II,"Full of thistle-down the prairie,"
11220,II,And the maid with hair like sunshine
11221,II,Vanished from his sight forever;
11222,II,Never more did Shawondasee
11223,II,See the maid with yellow tresses!
11224,II,"Poor, deluded Shawondasee!"
11225,II,"'T was no woman that you gazed at,"
11226,II,"'T was no maiden that you sighed for,"
11227,II,'T was the prairie dandelion
11228,II,That through all the dreamy Summer
11229,II,"You had gazed at with such longing,"
11230,II,"You had sighed for with such passion,"
11231,II,"And had puffed away forever,"
11232,II,Blown into the air with sighing.
11233,II,Ah! deluded Shawondasee!
11234,II,Thus the Four Winds were divided;
11235,II,Thus the sons of Mudjekeewis
11236,II,"Had their stations in the heavens,"
11237,II,At the corners of the heavens;
11238,II,For himself the West-Wind only
11239,II,Kept the mighty Mudjekeewis.

11503,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Ere the first to earth had fallen!
11504,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"He had mittens, Minjekahwun,"
11505,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Magic mittens made of deer-skin;
11506,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"When upon his hands he wore them,"
11507,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"He could smite the rocks asunder,"
11508,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,He could grind them into powder.
11509,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"He had moccasins enchanted,"
11510,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Magic moccasins of deer-skin;
11511,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"When he bound them round his ankles,"
11512,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"When upon his feet he tied them,"
11513,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,At each stride a mile he measured!
11514,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Much he questioned old Nokomis
11515,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Of his father Mudjekeewis;
11516,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Learned from her the fatal secret
11517,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the beauty of his mother,"
11518,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Of the falsehood of his father;
11519,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And his heart was hot within him,"
11520,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Like a living coal his heart was.
11521,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Then he said to old Nokomis,"
11522,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""I will go to Mudjekeewis,"
11523,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"See how fares it with my father,"
11524,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"At the doorways of the West-Wind,"
11525,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"At the portals of the Sunset!"""
11526,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"From his lodge went Hiawatha,"
11527,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Dressed for travel, armed for hunting;"
11528,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Dressed in deer-skin shirt and leggings,"
11529,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Richly wrought with quills and wampum;
11530,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"On his head his eagle-feathers,"
11531,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Round his waist his belt of wampum,"
11532,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"In his hand his bow of ash-wood,"
11533,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Strung with sinews of the reindeer;
11534,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"In his quiver oaken arrows,"
11535,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Tipped with jasper, winged with feathers;"
11536,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With his mittens, Minjekahwun,"
11537,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,With his moccasins enchanted.
11538,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Warning said the old Nokomis,"
11539,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Go not forth, O Hiawatha!"
11540,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"To the kingdom of the West-Wind,"
11541,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"To the realms of Mudjekeewis,"
11542,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Lest he harm you with his magic,"
11543,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Lest he kill you with his cunning!"""
11544,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,But the fearless Hiawatha
11545,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Heeded not her woman's warning;
11546,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Forth he strode into the forest,"
11547,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,At each stride a mile he measured;
11548,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Lurid seemed the sky above him,"
11549,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Lurid seemed the earth beneath him,"
11550,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Hot and close the air around him,"
11551,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Filled with smoke and fiery vapors,"
11552,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"As of burning woods and prairies,"
11553,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"For his heart was hot within him,"
11554,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Like a living coal his heart was.
11555,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"So he journeyed westward, westward,"
11556,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Left the fleetest deer behind him,"
11557,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Left the antelope and bison;
11558,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Crossed the rushing Esconaba,"
11559,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Crossed the mighty Mississippi,"
11560,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Passed the Mountains of the Prairie,"
11561,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Passed the land of Crows and Foxes,"
11562,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Passed the dwellings of the Blackfeet,"
11563,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Came unto the Rocky Mountains,"
11564,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"To the kingdom of the West-Wind,"
11565,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Where upon the gusty summits
11566,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Sat the ancient Mudjekeewis,"
11567,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Ruler of the winds of heaven.
11568,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Filled with awe was Hiawatha
11569,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,At the aspect of his father.
11570,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,On the air about him wildly
11571,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Tossed and streamed his cloudy tresses,"
11572,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Gleamed like drifting snow his tresses,"
11573,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Glared like Ishkoodah, the comet,"
11574,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Like the star with fiery tresses.
11575,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Filled with joy was Mudjekeewis
11576,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"When he looked on Hiawatha,"
11577,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Saw his youth rise up before him
11578,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"In the face of Hiawatha,"
11579,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Saw the beauty of Wenonah
11580,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,From the grave rise up before him.
11581,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Welcome!"" said he, ""Hiawatha,"
11582,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,To the kingdom of the West-Wind!
11583,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Long have I been waiting for you!
11584,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Youth is lovely, age is lonely,"
11585,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Youth is fiery, age is frosty;"
11586,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"You bring back the days departed,"
11587,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"You bring back my youth of passion,"
11588,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And the beautiful Wenonah!"""
11589,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Many days they talked together,"
11590,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Questioned, listened, waited, answered;"
11591,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Much the mighty Mudjekeewis
11592,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Boasted of his ancient prowess,"
11593,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of his perilous adventures,"
11594,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"His indomitable courage,"
11595,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,His invulnerable body.
11596,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Patiently sat Hiawatha,"
11597,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Listening to his father's boasting;
11598,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With a smile he sat and listened,"
11599,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Uttered neither threat nor menace,"
11600,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Neither word nor look betrayed him,"
11601,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"But his heart was hot within him,"
11602,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Like a living coal his heart was.
11603,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Then he said, ""O Mudjekeewis,"
11604,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Is there nothing that can harm you?
11605,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Nothing that you are afraid of?"""
11606,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And the mighty Mudjekeewis,"
11607,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Grand and gracious in his boasting,"
11608,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Answered, saying, ""There is nothing,"
11609,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Nothing but the black rock yonder,"
11610,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Nothing but the fatal Wawbeek!"""
11611,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,And he looked at Hiawatha
11612,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With a wise look and benignant,"
11613,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With a countenance paternal,"
11614,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Looked with pride upon the beauty
11615,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of his tall and graceful figure,"
11616,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Saying, ""O my Hiawatha!"
11617,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Is there anything can harm you?
11618,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Anything you are afraid of?"""
11619,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,But the wary Hiawatha
11620,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Paused awhile, as if uncertain,"
11621,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Held his peace, as if resolving,"
11622,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And then answered, ""There is nothing,"
11623,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Nothing but the bulrush yonder,"
11624,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Nothing but the great Apukwa!"""
11625,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And as Mudjekeewis, rising,"
11626,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Stretched his hand to pluck the bulrush,"
11627,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Hiawatha cried in terror,"
11628,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Cried in well-dissembled terror,"
11629,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Kago! kago! do not touch it!"""
11630,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Ah, kaween!"" said Mudjekeewis,"
11631,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""No indeed, I will not touch it!"""
11632,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Then they talked of other matters;
11633,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"First of Hiawatha's brothers,"
11634,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"First of Wabun, of the East-Wind,"
11635,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the South-Wind, Shawondasee,"
11636,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the North, Kabibonokka;"
11637,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Then of Hiawatha's mother,"
11638,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the beautiful Wenonah,"
11639,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of her birth upon the meadow,"
11640,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of her death, as old Nokomis"
11641,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Had remembered and related.
11642,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And he cried, ""O Mudjekeewis,"
11643,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"It was you who killed Wenonah,"
11644,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Took her young life and her beauty,"
11645,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Broke the Lily of the Prairie,"
11646,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Trampled it beneath your footsteps;
11647,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"You confess it! you confess it!"""
11648,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,And the mighty Mudjekeewis
11649,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Tossed upon the wind his tresses,"
11650,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Bowed his hoary head in anguish,"
11651,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,With a silent nod assented.
11652,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Then up started Hiawatha,"
11653,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,And with threatening look and gesture
11654,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Laid his hand upon the black rock,"
11655,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"On the fatal Wawbeek laid it,"
11656,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With his mittens, Minjekahwun,"
11657,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Rent the jutting crag asunder,"
11658,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Smote and crushed it into fragments,"
11659,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Hurled them madly at his father,"
11660,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"The remorseful Mudjekeewis,"
11661,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"For his heart was hot within him,"
11662,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Like a living coal his heart was.
11663,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,But the ruler of the West-Wind
11664,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Blew the fragments backward from him,"
11665,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With the breathing of his nostrils,"
11666,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With the tempest of his anger,"
11667,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Blew them back at his assailant;
11668,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Seized the bulrush, the Apukwa,"
11669,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Dragged it with its roots and fibres
11670,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"From the margin of the meadow,"
11671,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,From its ooze the giant bulrush;
11672,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Long and loud laughed Hiawatha!
11673,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Then began the deadly conflict,"
11674,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Hand to hand among the mountains;
11675,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"From his eyry screamed the eagle,"
11676,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"The Keneu, the great war-eagle,"
11677,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Sat upon the crags around them,"
11678,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Wheeling flapped his wings above them.
11679,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Like a tall tree in the tempest
11680,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Bent and lashed the giant bulrush;
11681,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,And in masses huge and heavy
11682,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Crashing fell the fatal Wawbeek;
11683,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Till the earth shook with the tumult
11684,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And confusion of the battle,"
11685,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And the air was full of shoutings,"
11686,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And the thunder of the mountains,"
11687,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Starting, answered, ""Baim-wawa!"""
11688,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Back retreated Mudjekeewis,"
11689,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Rushing westward o'er the mountains,"
11690,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Stumbling westward down the mountains,"
11691,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Three whole days retreated fighting,"
11692,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Still pursued by Hiawatha
11693,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"To the doorways of the West-Wind,"
11694,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"To the portals of the Sunset,"
11695,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"To the earth's remotest border,"
11696,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Where into the empty spaces
11697,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Sinks the sun, as a flamingo"
11698,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Drops into her nest at nightfall,"
11699,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,In the melancholy marshes.
11700,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Hold!"" at length cried Mudjekeewis,"
11701,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Hold, my son, my Hiawatha!"
11702,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"'T is impossible to kill me,"
11703,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,For you cannot kill the immortal.
11704,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"I have put you to this trial,"
11705,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,But to know and prove your courage;
11706,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Now receive the prize of valor!
11707,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""Go back to your home and people,"
11708,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Live among them, toil among them,"
11709,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Cleanse the earth from all that harms it,"
11710,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Clear the fishing-grounds and rivers,"
11711,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Slay all monsters and magicians,"
11712,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"All the Wendigoes, the giants,"
11713,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"All the serpents, the Kenabeeks,"
11714,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"As I slew the Mishe-Mokwa,"
11715,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Slew the Great Bear of the mountains.
11716,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"""And at last when Death draws near you,"
11717,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,When the awful eyes of Pauguk
11718,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Glare upon you in the darkness,"
11719,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"I will share my kingdom with you,"
11720,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Ruler shall you be thenceforward
11721,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,"
11722,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the home-wind, the Keewaydin."""
11723,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Thus was fought that famous battle
11724,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"In the dreadful days of Shah-shah,"
11725,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"In the days long since departed,"
11726,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,In the kingdom of the West-Wind.
11727,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Still the hunter sees its traces
11728,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Scattered far o'er hill and valley;
11729,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Sees the giant bulrush growing
11730,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"By the ponds and water-courses,"
11731,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Sees the masses of the Wawbeek
11732,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Lying still in every valley.
11733,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Homeward now went Hiawatha;
11734,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Pleasant was the landscape round him,"
11735,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Pleasant was the air above him,"
11736,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,For the bitterness of anger
11737,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Had departed wholly from him,"
11738,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"From his brain the thought of vengeance,"
11739,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,From his heart the burning fever.
11740,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Only once his pace he slackened,"
11741,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Only once he paused or halted,"
11742,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Paused to purchase heads of arrows
11743,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Of the ancient Arrow-maker,"
11744,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"In the land of the Dacotahs,"
11745,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Where the Falls of Minnehaha
11746,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Flash and gleam among the oak-trees,"
11747,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Laugh and leap into the valley.
11748,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,There the ancient Arrow-maker
11749,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Made his arrow-heads of sandstone,"
11750,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Arrow-heads of chalcedony,"
11751,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Arrow-heads of flint and jasper,"
11752,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Smoothed and sharpened at the edges,"
11753,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Hard and polished, keen and costly."
11754,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With him dwelt his dark-eyed daughter,"
11755,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Wayward as the Minnehaha,"
11756,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"With her moods of shade and sunshine,"
11757,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Eyes that smiled and frowned alternate,"
11758,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Feet as rapid as the river,"
11759,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Tresses flowing like the water,"
11760,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,And as musical a laughter;
11761,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"And he named her from the river,"
11762,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"From the water-fall he named her,"
11763,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Minnehaha, Laughing Water."
11764,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Was it then for heads of arrows,"
11765,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Arrow-heads of chalcedony,"
11766,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Arrow-heads of flint and jasper,"
11767,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,That my Hiawatha halted
11768,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,In the land of the Dacotahs?
11769,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Was it not to see the maiden,"
11770,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,See the face of Laughing Water
11771,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Peeping from behind the curtain,"
11772,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Hear the rustling of her garments
11773,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"From behind the waving curtain,"
11774,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,As one sees the Minnehaha
11775,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Gleaming, glancing through the branches,"
11776,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,As one hears the Laughing Water
11777,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,From behind its screen of branches?
11778,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Who shall say what thoughts and visions
11779,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Fill the fiery brains of young men?
11780,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Who shall say what dreams of beauty
11781,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Filled the heart of Hiawatha?
11782,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"All he told to old Nokomis,"
11783,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"When he reached the lodge at sunset,"
11784,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Was the meeting with his father,"
11785,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Was his fight with Mudjekeewis;
11786,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,"Not a word he said of arrows,"
11787,HIAWATHA AND MUDJEKEEWIS,Not a word of Laughing Water.

11795,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,You shall hear how Hiawatha
11796,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Prayed and fasted in the forest,"
11797,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Not for greater skill in hunting,"
11798,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Not for greater craft in fishing,"
11799,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Not for triumphs in the battle,"
11800,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And renown among the warriors,"
11801,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"But for profit of the people,"
11802,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,For advantage of the nations.
11803,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"First he built a lodge for fasting,"
11804,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Built a wigwam in the forest,"
11805,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"By the shining Big-Sea-Water,"
11806,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"In the blithe and pleasant Spring-time,"
11807,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"In the Moon of Leaves he built it,"
11808,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And, with dreams and visions many,"
11809,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Seven whole days and nights he fasted.
11810,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,On the first day of his fasting
11811,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Through the leafy woods he wandered;
11812,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the deer start from the thicket,"
11813,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the rabbit in his burrow,"
11814,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard the pheasant, Bena, drumming,"
11815,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard the squirrel, Adjidaumo,"
11816,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Rattling in his hoard of acorns,"
11817,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the pigeon, the Omeme,"
11818,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Building nests among the pine-trees,"
11819,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And in flocks the wild-goose, Wawa,"
11820,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Flying to the fen-lands northward,"
11821,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Whirring, wailing far above him."
11822,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Master of Life!"" he cried, desponding,"
11823,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Must our lives depend on these things?"""
11824,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,On the next day of his fasting
11825,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"By the river's brink he wandered,"
11826,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Through the Muskoday, the meadow,"
11827,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the wild rice, Mahnomonee,"
11828,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the blueberry, Meenahga,"
11829,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the strawberry, Odahmin,"
11830,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the gooseberry, Shahbomin,"
11831,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the grape-vine, the Bemahgut,"
11832,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Trailing o'er the alder-branches,"
11833,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Filling all the air with fragrance!
11834,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Master of Life!"" he cried, desponding,"
11835,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Must our lives depend on these things?"""
11836,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,On the third day of his fasting
11837,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"By the lake he sat and pondered,"
11838,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"By the still, transparent water;"
11839,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the sturgeon, Nahma, leaping,"
11840,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Scattering drops like beads of wampum,"
11841,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the yellow perch, the Sahwa,"
11842,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Like a sunbeam in the water,"
11843,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,"
11844,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the herring, Okahahwis,"
11845,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the Shawgashee, the crawfish!"
11846,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Master of Life!"" he cried, desponding,"
11847,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Must our lives depend on these things?"""
11848,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,On the fourth day of his fasting
11849,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,In his lodge he lay exhausted;
11850,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,From his couch of leaves and branches
11851,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Gazing with half-open eyelids,"
11852,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Full of shadowy dreams and visions,"
11853,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"On the dizzy, swimming landscape,"
11854,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"On the gleaming of the water,"
11855,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,On the splendor of the sunset.
11856,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And he saw a youth approaching,"
11857,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Dressed in garments green and yellow,"
11858,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Coming through the purple twilight,"
11859,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Through the splendor of the sunset;
11860,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Plumes of green bent o'er his forehead,"
11861,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And his hair was soft and golden.
11862,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Standing at the open doorway,"
11863,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Long he looked at Hiawatha,"
11864,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Looked with pity and compassion
11865,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"On his wasted form and features,"
11866,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And, in accents like the sighing"
11867,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Of the South-Wind in the tree-tops,"
11868,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Said he, ""O my Hiawatha!"
11869,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"All your prayers are heard in heaven,"
11870,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,For you pray not like the others;
11871,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Not for greater skill in hunting,"
11872,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Not for greater craft in fishing,"
11873,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Not for triumph in the battle,"
11874,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Nor renown among the warriors,"
11875,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"But for profit of the people,"
11876,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,For advantage of the nations.
11877,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""From the Master of Life descending,"
11878,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"I, the friend of man, Mondamin,"
11879,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Come to warn you and instruct you,"
11880,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,How by struggle and by labor
11881,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,You shall gain what you have prayed for.
11882,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Rise up from your bed of branches,"
11883,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Rise, O youth, and wrestle with me!"""
11884,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Faint with famine, Hiawatha"
11885,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Started from his bed of branches,"
11886,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,From the twilight of his wigwam
11887,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Forth into the flush of sunset
11888,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Came, and wrestled with Mondamin;"
11889,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,At his touch he felt new courage
11890,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Throbbing in his brain and bosom,"
11891,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Felt new life and hope and vigor
11892,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Run through every nerve and fibre.
11893,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,So they wrestled there together
11894,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"In the glory of the sunset,"
11895,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the more they strove and struggled,"
11896,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Stronger still grew Hiawatha;
11897,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the darkness fell around them,"
11898,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
11899,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"From her nest among the pine-trees,"
11900,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Gave a cry of lamentation,"
11901,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Gave a scream of pain and famine.
11902,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""'T is enough!"" then said Mondamin,"
11903,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Smiling upon Hiawatha,"
11904,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""But tomorrow, when the sun sets,"
11905,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"I will come again to try you."""
11906,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And he vanished, and was seen not;"
11907,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Whether sinking as the rain sinks,"
11908,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Whether rising as the mists rise,"
11909,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Hiawatha saw not, knew not,"
11910,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Only saw that he had vanished,"
11911,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Leaving him alone and fainting,"
11912,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"With the misty lake below him,"
11913,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And the reeling stars above him.
11914,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"On the morrow and the next day,"
11915,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"When the sun through heaven descending,"
11916,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Like a red and burning cinder
11917,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"From the hearth of the Great Spirit,"
11918,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Fell into the western waters,"
11919,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Came Mondamin for the trial,"
11920,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,For the strife with Hiawatha;
11921,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Came as silent as the dew comes,"
11922,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"From the empty air appearing,"
11923,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Into empty air returning,"
11924,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Taking shape when earth it touches,"
11925,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,But invisible to all men
11926,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,In its coming and its going.
11927,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Thrice they wrestled there together
11928,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"In the glory of the sunset,"
11929,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the darkness fell around them,"
11930,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
11931,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"From her nest among the pine-trees,"
11932,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Uttered her loud cry of famine,"
11933,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And Mondamin paused to listen.
11934,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Tall and beautiful he stood there,"
11935,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,In his garments green and yellow;
11936,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"To and fro his plumes above him,"
11937,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Waved and nodded with his breathing,"
11938,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And the sweat of the encounter
11939,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Stood like drops of dew upon him.
11940,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And he cried, ""O Hiawatha!"
11941,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Bravely have you wrestled with me,"
11942,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Thrice have wrestled stoutly with me,"
11943,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the Master of Life, who sees us,"
11944,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"He will give to you the triumph!"""
11945,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Then he smiled, and said: ""To-morrow"
11946,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Is the last day of your conflict,"
11947,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Is the last day of your fasting.
11948,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,You will conquer and o'ercome me;
11949,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Make a bed for me to lie in,"
11950,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Where the rain may fall upon me,"
11951,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Where the sun may come and warm me;
11952,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Strip these garments, green and yellow,"
11953,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Strip this nodding plumage from me,"
11954,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Lay me in the earth, and make it"
11955,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Soft and loose and light above me.
11956,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"""Let no hand disturb my slumber,"
11957,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Let no weed nor worm molest me,"
11958,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Let not Kahgahgee, the raven,"
11959,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Come to haunt me and molest me,"
11960,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Only come yourself to watch me,"
11961,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till I wake, and start, and quicken,"
11962,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till I leap into the sunshine."""
11963,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And thus saying, he departed;"
11964,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Peacefully slept Hiawatha,"
11965,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"But he heard the Wawonaissa,"
11966,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard the whippoorwill complaining,"
11967,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Perched upon his lonely wigwam;
11968,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard the rushing Sebowisha,"
11969,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard the rivulet rippling near him,"
11970,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Talking to the darksome forest;
11971,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard the sighing of the branches,"
11972,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,As they lifted and subsided
11973,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"At the passing of the night-wind,"
11974,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Heard them, as one hears in slumber"
11975,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Far-off murmurs, dreamy whispers:"
11976,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Peacefully slept Hiawatha.
11977,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"On the morrow came Nokomis,"
11978,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"On the seventh day of his fasting,"
11979,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Came with food for Hiawatha,"
11980,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Came imploring and bewailing,"
11981,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Lest his hunger should o'ercome him,"
11982,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Lest his fasting should be fatal.
11983,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"But he tasted not, and touched not,"
11984,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Only said to her, ""Nokomis,"
11985,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Wait until the sun is setting,"
11986,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the darkness falls around us,"
11987,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
11988,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Crying from the desolate marshes,"
11989,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Tells us that the day is ended."""
11990,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Homeward weeping went Nokomis,"
11991,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Sorrowing for her Hiawatha,"
11992,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Fearing lest his strength should fail him,"
11993,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Lest his fasting should be fatal.
11994,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,He meanwhile sat weary waiting
11995,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"For the coming of Mondamin,"
11996,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the shadows, pointing eastward,"
11997,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Lengthened over field and forest,"
11998,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Till the sun dropped from the heaven,"
11999,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Floating on the waters westward,"
12000,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,As a red leaf in the Autumn
12001,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Falls and floats upon the water,"
12002,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Falls and sinks into its bosom.
12003,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And behold! the young Mondamin,"
12004,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"With his soft and shining tresses,"
12005,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"With his garments green and yellow,"
12006,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"With his long and glossy plumage,"
12007,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Stood and beckoned at the doorway.
12008,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And as one in slumber walking,"
12009,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Pale and haggard, but undaunted,"
12010,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,From the wigwam Hiawatha
12011,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Came and wrestled with Mondamin.
12012,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Round about him spun the landscape,"
12013,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Sky and forest reeled together,"
12014,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And his strong heart leaped within him,"
12015,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,As the sturgeon leaps and struggles
12016,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,In a net to break its meshes.
12017,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Like a ring of fire around him
12018,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Blazed and flared the red horizon,"
12019,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And a hundred suns seemed looking
12020,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,At the combat of the wrestlers.
12021,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Suddenly upon the greensward
12022,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"All alone stood Hiawatha,"
12023,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Panting with his wild exertion,"
12024,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Palpitating with the struggle;
12025,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And before him breathless, lifeless,"
12026,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Lay the youth, with hair dishevelled,"
12027,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Plumage torn, and garments tattered,"
12028,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Dead he lay there in the sunset.
12029,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And victorious Hiawatha
12030,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Made the grave as he commanded,"
12031,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Stripped the garments from Mondamin,"
12032,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Stripped his tattered plumage from him,"
12033,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Laid him in the earth, and made it"
12034,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Soft and loose and light above him;
12035,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
12036,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"From the melancholy moorlands,"
12037,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Gave a cry of lamentation,"
12038,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Gave a cry of pain and anguish!
12039,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Homeward then went Hiawatha
12040,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"To the lodge of old Nokomis,"
12041,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And the seven days of his fasting
12042,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Were accomplished and completed.
12043,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,But the place was not forgotten
12044,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Where he wrestled with Mondamin;
12045,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Nor forgotten nor neglected
12046,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Was the grave where lay Mondamin,"
12047,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Sleeping in the rain and sunshine,"
12048,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Where his scattered plumes and garments
12049,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Faded in the rain and sunshine.
12050,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Day by day did Hiawatha
12051,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Go to wait and watch beside it;
12052,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Kept the dark mould soft above it,"
12053,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Kept it clean from weeds and insects,"
12054,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Drove away, with scoffs and shoutings,"
12055,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Kahgahgee, the king of ravens."
12056,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Till at length a small green feather
12057,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"From the earth shot slowly upward,"
12058,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Then another and another,"
12059,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And before the Summer ended
12060,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Stood the maize in all its beauty,"
12061,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"With its shining robes about it,"
12062,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And its long, soft, yellow tresses;"
12063,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And in rapture Hiawatha
12064,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Cried aloud, ""It is Mondamin!"
12065,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Yes, the friend of man, Mondamin!"""
12066,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Then he called to old Nokomis
12067,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And Iagoo, the great boaster,"
12068,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Showed them where the maize was growing,"
12069,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Told them of his wondrous vision,"
12070,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Of his wrestling and his triumph,"
12071,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Of this new gift to the nations,"
12072,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,Which should be their food forever.
12073,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"And still later, when the Autumn"
12074,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Changed the long, green leaves to yellow,"
12075,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And the soft and juicy kernels
12076,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Grew like wampum hard and yellow,"
12077,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Then the ripened ears he gathered,"
12078,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Stripped the withered husks from off them,"
12079,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"As he once had stripped the wrestler,"
12080,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,"Gave the first Feast of Mondamin,"
12081,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,And made known unto the people
12082,HIAWATHA'S FASTING,This new gift of the Great Spirit.

12432,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"See the yellow perch, the Sahwa,"
12433,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Like a sunbeam in the water,"
12434,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"See the Shawgashee, the craw-fish,"
12435,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Like a spider on the bottom,"
12436,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,On the white and sandy bottom.
12437,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"At the stern sat Hiawatha,"
12438,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With his fishing-line of cedar;
12439,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,In his plumes the breeze of morning
12440,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Played as in the hemlock branches;
12441,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"On the bows, with tail erected,"
12442,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sat the squirrel, Adjidaumo;"
12443,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,In his fur the breeze of morning
12444,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Played as in the prairie grasses.
12445,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,On the white sand of the bottom
12446,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lay the monster Mishe-Nahma,"
12447,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lay the sturgeon, King of Fishes;"
12448,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Through his gills he breathed the water,"
12449,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With his fins he fanned and winnowed,"
12450,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With his tail he swept the sand-floor.
12451,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,There he lay in all his armor;
12452,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"On each side a shield to guard him,"
12453,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Plates of bone upon his forehead,"
12454,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Down his sides and back and shoulders
12455,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Plates of bone with spines projecting
12456,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Painted was he with his war-paints,"
12457,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Stripes of yellow, red, and azure,"
12458,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Spots of brown and spots of sable;
12459,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he lay there on the bottom,"
12460,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Fanning with his fins of purple,"
12461,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,As above him Hiawatha
12462,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In his birch canoe came sailing,"
12463,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With his fishing-line of cedar.
12464,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take my bait,"" cried Hiawatha,"
12465,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Down into the depths beneath him,"
12466,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take my bait, O Sturgeon, Nahma!"
12467,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Come up from below the water,"
12468,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Let us see which is the stronger!"""
12469,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And he dropped his line of cedar
12470,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Through the clear, transparent water,"
12471,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Waited vainly for an answer,"
12472,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Long sat waiting for an answer,"
12473,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And repeating loud and louder,"
12474,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take my bait, O King of Fishes!"""
12475,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Quiet lay the sturgeon, Nahma,"
12476,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Fanning slowly in the water,"
12477,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Looking up at Hiawatha,"
12478,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Listening to his call and clamor,"
12479,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"His unnecessary tumult,"
12480,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till he wearied of the shouting;
12481,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he said to the Kenozha,"
12482,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"To the pike, the Maskenozha,"
12483,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take the bait of this rude fellow,"
12484,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Break the line of Hiawatha!"""
12485,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,In his fingers Hiawatha
12486,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Felt the loose line jerk and tighten;
12487,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As he drew it in, it tugged so"
12488,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"That the birch canoe stood endwise,"
12489,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Like a birch log in the water,"
12490,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With the squirrel, Adjidaumo,"
12491,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Perched and frisking on the summit.
12492,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Full of scorn was Hiawatha
12493,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"When he saw the fish rise upward,"
12494,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Saw the pike, the Maskenozha,"
12495,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Coming nearer, nearer to him,"
12496,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he shouted through the water,"
12497,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Esa! esa! shame upon you!"
12498,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are but the pike, Kenozha,"
12499,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the fish I wanted,"
12500,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the King of Fishes!"""
12501,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Reeling downward to the bottom
12502,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sank the pike in great confusion,"
12503,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And the mighty sturgeon, Nahma,"
12504,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Said to Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
12505,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"To the bream, with scales of crimson,"
12506,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Take the bait of this great boaster,"
12507,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Break the line of Hiawatha!"""
12508,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slowly upward, wavering, gleaming,"
12509,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Rose the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
12510,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Seized the line of Hiawatha,"
12511,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Swung with all his weight upon it,"
12512,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Made a whirlpool in the water,"
12513,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Whirled the birch canoe in circles,"
12514,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Round and round in gurgling eddies,"
12515,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the circles in the water
12516,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Reached the far-off sandy beaches,"
12517,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the water-flags and rushes
12518,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Nodded on the distant margins.
12519,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,But when Hiawatha saw him
12520,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slowly rising through the water,"
12521,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lifting up his disk refulgent,"
12522,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Loud he shouted in derision,"
12523,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Esa! esa! shame upon you!"
12524,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
12525,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the fish I wanted,"
12526,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"You are not the King of Fishes!"""
12527,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slowly downward, wavering, gleaming,"
12528,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sank the Ugudwash, the sun-fish,"
12529,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And again the sturgeon, Nahma,"
12530,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard the shout of Hiawatha,"
12531,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard his challenge of defiance,"
12532,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"The unnecessary tumult,"
12533,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Ringing far across the water.
12534,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,From the white sand of the bottom
12535,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Up he rose with angry gesture,"
12536,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Quivering in each nerve and fibre,"
12537,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Clashing all his plates of armor,"
12538,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Gleaming bright with all his war-paint;
12539,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In his wrath he darted upward,"
12540,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Flashing leaped into the sunshine,"
12541,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Opened his great jaws, and swallowed"
12542,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Both canoe and Hiawatha.
12543,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Down into that darksome cavern
12544,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Plunged the headlong Hiawatha,"
12545,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,As a log on some black river
12546,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Shoots and plunges down the rapids,"
12547,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Found himself in utter darkness,"
12548,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Groped about in helpless wonder,"
12549,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till he felt a great heart beating,"
12550,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Throbbing in that utter darkness.
12551,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he smote it in his anger,"
12552,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With his fist, the heart of Nahma,"
12553,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Felt the mighty King of Fishes
12554,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Shudder through each nerve and fibre,"
12555,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Heard the water gurgle round him
12556,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As he leaped and staggered through it,"
12557,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Sick at heart, and faint and weary."
12558,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Crosswise then did Hiawatha
12559,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Drag his birch-canoe for safety,"
12560,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lest from out the jaws of Nahma,"
12561,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In the turmoil and confusion,"
12562,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Forth he might be hurled and perish.
12563,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And the squirrel, Adjidaumo,"
12564,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Frisked and chatted very gayly,"
12565,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Toiled and tugged with Hiawatha
12566,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the labor was completed.
12567,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then said Hiawatha to him,"
12568,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""O my little friend, the squirrel,"
12569,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Bravely have you toiled to help me;
12570,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Take the thanks of Hiawatha,"
12571,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And the name which now he gives you;
12572,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,For hereafter and forever
12573,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Boys shall call you Adjidaumo,"
12574,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Tail-in-air the boys shall call you!"""
12575,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And again the sturgeon, Nahma,"
12576,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Gasped and quivered in the water,"
12577,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then was still, and drifted landward"
12578,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till he grated on the pebbles,"
12579,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Till the listening Hiawatha
12580,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard him grate upon the margin,"
12581,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Felt him strand upon the pebbles,"
12582,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Knew that Nahma, King of Fishes,"
12583,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Lay there dead upon the margin.
12584,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then he heard a clang and flapping,"
12585,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As of many wings assembling,"
12586,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard a screaming and confusion,"
12587,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"As of birds of prey contending,"
12588,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Saw a gleam of light above him,"
12589,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Shining through the ribs of Nahma,"
12590,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Saw the glittering eyes of sea-gulls,"
12591,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Of Kayoshk, the sea-gulls, peering,"
12592,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Gazing at him through the opening,"
12593,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Heard them saying to each other,"
12594,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""'T is our brother, Hiawatha!"""
12595,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he shouted from below them,"
12596,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Cried exulting from the caverns:
12597,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""O ye sea-gulls! O my brothers!"
12598,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"I have slain the sturgeon, Nahma;"
12599,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Make the rifts a little larger,"
12600,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"With your claws the openings widen,"
12601,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Set me free from this dark prison,"
12602,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And henceforward and forever
12603,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Men shall speak of your achievements,"
12604,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Calling you Kayoshk, the sea-gulls,"
12605,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Yes, Kayoshk, the Noble Scratchers!"""
12606,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And the wild and clamorous sea-gulls
12607,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Toiled with beak and claws together,"
12608,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Made the rifts and openings wider
12609,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In the mighty ribs of Nahma,"
12610,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And from peril and from prison,"
12611,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"From the body of the sturgeon,"
12612,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"From the peril of the water,"
12613,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,They released my Hiawatha.
12614,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"He was standing near his wigwam,"
12615,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"On the margin of the water,"
12616,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And he called to old Nokomis,"
12617,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Called and beckoned to Nokomis,"
12618,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Pointed to the sturgeon, Nahma,"
12619,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Lying lifeless on the pebbles,"
12620,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,With the sea-gulls feeding on him.
12621,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""I have slain the Mishe-Nahma,"
12622,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Slain the King of Fishes!"" said he;"
12623,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"""Look! the sea-gulls feed upon him,"
12624,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Yes, my friends Kayoshk, the sea-gulls;"
12625,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Drive them not away, Nokomis,"
12626,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,They have saved me from great peril
12627,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"In the body of the sturgeon,"
12628,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Wait until their meal is ended,"
12629,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till their craws are full with feasting,"
12630,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till they homeward fly, at sunset,"
12631,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,To their nests among the marshes;
12632,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Then bring all your pots and kettles,"
12633,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And make oil for us in Winter."""
12634,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And she waited till the sun set,"
12635,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the pallid moon, the Night-sun,"
12636,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Rose above the tranquil water,"
12637,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till Kayoshk, the sated sea-gulls,"
12638,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"From their banquet rose with clamor,"
12639,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And across the fiery sunset
12640,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Winged their way to far-off islands,"
12641,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,To their nests among the rushes.
12642,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"To his sleep went Hiawatha,"
12643,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And Nokomis to her labor,"
12644,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Toiling patient in the moonlight,"
12645,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the sun and moon changed places,"
12646,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the sky was red with sunrise,"
12647,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"And Kayoshk, the hungry sea-gulls,"
12648,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Came back from the reedy islands,"
12649,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Clamorous for their morning banquet.
12650,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Three whole days and nights alternate
12651,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,Old Nokomis and the sea-gulls
12652,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Stripped the oily flesh of Nahma,"
12653,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the waves washed through the rib-bones,"
12654,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,"Till the sea-gulls came no longer,"
12655,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,And upon the sands lay nothing
12656,HIAWATHA'S FISHING,But the skeleton of Nahma.

12670,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Fiercely the red sun descending
12671,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Burned his way along the heavens,"
12672,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Set the sky on fire behind him,"

12743,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And they answered, hissing fiercely,"
12744,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,With their fiery breath made answer:
12745,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Back, go back! O Shaugodaya!"
12746,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!"""
12747,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Then the angry Hiawatha
12748,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Raised his mighty bow of ash-tree,"
12749,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Seized his arrows, jasper-headed,"
12750,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Shot them fast among the serpents;
12751,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Every twanging of the bow-string
12752,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Was a war-cry and a death-cry,"
12753,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Every whizzing of an arrow
12754,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Was a death-song of Kenabeek.
12755,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Weltering in the bloody water,"
12756,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Dead lay all the fiery serpents,"
12757,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And among them Hiawatha
12758,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Harmless sailed, and cried exulting:"
12759,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Onward, O Cheemaun, my darling!"
12760,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Onward to the black pitch-water!"""
12761,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Then he took the oil of Nahma,"
12762,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And the bows and sides anointed,"
12763,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Smeared them well with oil, that swiftly"
12764,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,He might pass the black pitch-water.
12765,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"All night long he sailed upon it,"
12766,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Sailed upon that sluggish water,"
12767,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Covered with its mould of ages,"
12768,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Black with rotting water-rushes,"
12769,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Rank with flags and leaves of lilies,"
12770,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Stagnant, lifeless, dreary, dismal,"
12771,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Lighted by the shimmering moonlight,"
12772,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And by will-o'-the-wisps illumined,"
12773,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled,"
12774,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,In their weary night-encampments.
12775,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"All the air was white with moonlight,"
12776,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"All the water black with shadow,"
12777,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And around him the Suggema,"
12778,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"The mosquito, sang his war-song,"
12779,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And the fire-flies, Wah-wah-taysee,"
12780,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Waved their torches to mislead him;
12781,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And the bull-frog, the Dahinda,"
12782,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Thrust his head into the moonlight,"
12783,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Fixed his yellow eyes upon him,"
12784,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Sobbed and sank beneath the surface;
12785,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And anon a thousand whistles,"
12786,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Answered over all the fen-lands,"
12787,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
12788,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Far off on the reedy margin,"
12789,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Heralded the hero's coming.
12790,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Westward thus fared Hiawatha,"
12791,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Toward the realm of Megissogwon,"
12792,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather,"
12793,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Till the level moon stared at him,"
12794,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"In his face stared pale and haggard,"
12795,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Till the sun was hot behind him,"
12796,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Till it burned upon his shoulders,"
12797,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And before him on the upland
12798,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,He could see the Shining Wigwam
12799,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Of the Manito of Wampum,"
12800,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Of the mightiest of Magicians.
12801,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Then once more Cheemaun he patted,"
12802,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"To his birch-canoe said, ""Onward!"""
12803,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And it stirred in all its fibres,"
12804,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And with one great bound of triumph
12805,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Leaped across the water-lilies,"
12806,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Leaped through tangled flags and rushes,"
12807,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And upon the beach beyond them
12808,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Dry-shod landed Hiawatha.
12809,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Straight he took his bow of ash-tree,"
12810,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"On the sand one end he rested,"
12811,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With his knee he pressed the middle,"
12812,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter,"
12813,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Took an arrow, jasper-headed,"
12814,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Shot it at the Shining Wigwam,"
12815,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Sent it singing as a herald,"
12816,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"As a bearer of his message,"
12817,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Of his challenge loud and lofty:
12818,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Come forth from your lodge, Pearl-Feather!"
12819,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Hiawatha waits your coming!"""
12820,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Straightway from the Shining Wigwam
12821,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Came the mighty Megissogwon,"
12822,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Tall of stature, broad of shoulder,"
12823,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Dark and terrible in aspect,"
12824,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Clad from head to foot in wampum,"
12825,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Armed with all his warlike weapons,"
12826,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Painted like the sky of morning,"
12827,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Streaked with crimson, blue, and yellow,"
12828,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Crested with great eagle-feathers,"
12829,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Streaming upward, streaming outward."
12830,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Well I know you, Hiawatha!"""
12831,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Cried he in a voice of thunder,"
12832,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,In a tone of loud derision.
12833,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Hasten back, O Shaugodaya!"
12834,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Hasten back among the women,"
12835,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart!"
12836,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"I will slay you as you stand there,"
12837,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"As of old I slew her father!"""
12838,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"But my Hiawatha answered,"
12839,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Nothing daunted, fearing nothing:"
12840,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Big words do not smite like war-clubs,"
12841,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Boastful breath is not a bow-string,"
12842,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Taunts are not so sharp as arrows,"
12843,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Deeds are better things than words are,"
12844,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Actions mightier than boastings!"""
12845,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Then began the greatest battle
12846,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"That the sun had ever looked on,"
12847,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,That the war-birds ever witnessed.
12848,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"All a Summer's day it lasted,"
12849,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,From the sunrise to the sunset;
12850,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,For the shafts of Hiawatha
12851,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Harmless hit the shirt of wampum,"
12852,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Harmless fell the blows he dealt it
12853,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With his mittens, Minjekahwun,"
12854,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Harmless fell the heavy war-club;
12855,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"It could dash the rocks asunder,"
12856,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,But it could not break the meshes
12857,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Of that magic shirt of wampum.
12858,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Till at sunset Hiawatha,"
12859,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Leaning on his bow of ash-tree,"
12860,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Wounded, weary, and desponding,"
12861,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With his mighty war-club broken,"
12862,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With his mittens torn and tattered,"
12863,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And three useless arrows only,"
12864,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree,"
12865,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"From whose branches trailed the mosses,"
12866,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And whose trunk was coated over
12867,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With the Dead-man's Moccasin-leather,"
12868,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,With the fungus white and yellow.
12869,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Suddenly from the boughs above him
12870,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Sang the Mama, the woodpecker:"
12871,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Aim your arrows, Hiawatha,"
12872,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"At the head of Megissogwon,"
12873,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Strike the tuft of hair upon it,"
12874,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,At their roots the long black tresses;
12875,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"There alone can he be wounded!"""
12876,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper,"
12877,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow,"
12878,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Just as Megissogwon, stooping,"
12879,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Raised a heavy stone to throw it.
12880,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Full upon the crown it struck him,"
12881,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"At the roots of his long tresses,"
12882,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And he reeled and staggered forward,"
12883,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Plunging like a wounded bison,"
12884,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Yes, like Pezhekee, the bison,"
12885,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,When the snow is on the prairie.
12886,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Swifter flew the second arrow,"
12887,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"In the pathway of the other,"
12888,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Piercing deeper than the other,"
12889,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Wounding sorer than the other;
12890,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And the knees of Megissogwon
12891,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Shook like windy reeds beneath him,"
12892,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Bent and trembled like the rushes.
12893,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,But the third and latest arrow
12894,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Swiftest flew, and wounded sorest,"
12895,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And the mighty Megissogwon
12896,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk,"
12897,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Saw the eyes of Death glare at him,"
12898,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Heard his voice call in the darkness;
12899,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,At the feet of Hiawatha
12900,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather,"
12901,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Lay the mightiest of Magicians.
12902,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Then the grateful Hiawatha
12903,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Called the Mama, the woodpecker,"
12904,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,From his perch among the branches
12905,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Of the melancholy pine-tree,"
12906,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And, in honor of his service,"
12907,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Stained with blood the tuft of feathers
12908,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,On the little head of Mama;
12909,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Even to this day he wears it,"
12910,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Wears the tuft of crimson feathers,"
12911,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,As a symbol of his service.
12912,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Then he stripped the shirt of wampum
12913,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"From the back of Megissogwon,"
12914,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"As a trophy of the battle,"
12915,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,As a signal of his conquest.
12916,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"On the shore he left the body,"
12917,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Half on land and half in water,"
12918,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"In the sand his feet were buried,"
12919,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And his face was in the water.
12920,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And above him, wheeled and clamored"
12921,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"The Keneu, the great war-eagle,"
12922,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Sailing round in narrower circles,"
12923,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Hovering nearer, nearer, nearer."
12924,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,From the wigwam Hiawatha
12925,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Bore the wealth of Megissogwon,"
12926,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"All his wealth of skins and wampum,"
12927,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Furs of bison and of beaver,"
12928,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Furs of sable and of ermine,"
12929,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Wampum belts and strings and pouches,"
12930,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Quivers wrought with beads of wampum,"
12931,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Filled with arrows, silver-headed."
12932,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Homeward then he sailed exulting,"
12933,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Homeward through the black pitch-water,"
12934,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Homeward through the weltering serpents,"
12935,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With the trophies of the battle,"
12936,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,With a shout and song of triumph.
12937,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"On the shore stood old Nokomis,"
12938,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"On the shore stood Chibiabos,"
12939,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And the very strong man, Kwasind,"
12940,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Waiting for the hero's coming,"
12941,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Listening to his songs of triumph.
12942,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,And the people of the village
12943,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Welcomed him with songs and dances,"
12944,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Made a joyous feast, and shouted:"
12945,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"""Honor be to Hiawatha!"
12946,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"He has slain the great Pearl-Feather,"
12947,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Slain the mightiest of Magicians,"
12948,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Him, who sent the fiery fever,"
12949,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Sent the white fog from the fen-lands,"
12950,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"Sent disease and death among us!"""
12951,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Ever dear to Hiawatha
12952,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Was the memory of Mama!
12953,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"And in token of his friendship,"
12954,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"As a mark of his remembrance,"
12955,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,He adorned and decked his pipe-stem
12956,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"With the crimson tuft of feathers,"
12957,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,With the blood-red crest of Mama.
12958,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"But the wealth of Megissogwon,"
12959,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"All the trophies of the battle,"
12960,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,"He divided with his people,"
12961,HIAWATHA AND THE PEARL-FEATHER,Shared it equally among them.

13027,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Striding over moor and meadow,"
13028,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Through interminable forests,"
13029,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Through uninterrupted silence.
13030,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"With his moccasins of magic,"
13031,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,At each stride a mile he measured;
13032,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Yet the way seemed long before him,"
13033,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And his heart outran his footsteps;
13034,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And he journeyed without resting,"
13035,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Till he heard the cataract's laughter,"
13036,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
13037,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Calling to him through the silence.
13038,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""Pleasant is the sound!"" he murmured,"
13039,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""Pleasant is the voice that calls me!"""
13040,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"On the outskirts of the forests,"
13041,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,"
13042,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Herds of fallow deer were feeding,"
13043,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,But they saw not Hiawatha;
13044,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"To his bow he whispered, ""Fail not!"""
13045,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"To his arrow whispered, ""Swerve not!"""
13046,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sent it singing on its errand,"
13047,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,To the red heart of the roebuck;
13048,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Threw the deer across his shoulder,"
13049,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And sped forward without pausing.
13050,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,At the doorway of his wigwam
13051,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sat the ancient Arrow-maker,"
13052,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"In the land of the Dacotahs,"
13053,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Making arrow-heads of jasper,"
13054,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Arrow-heads of chalcedony.
13055,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"At his side, in all her beauty,"
13056,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sat the lovely Minnehaha,"
13057,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sat his daughter, Laughing Water,"
13058,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Plaiting mats of flags and rushes
13059,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Of the past the old man's thoughts were,"
13060,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And the maiden's of the future.
13061,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"He was thinking, as he sat there,"
13062,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Of the days when with such arrows
13063,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"He had struck the deer and bison,"
13064,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"On the Muskoday, the meadow;"
13065,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Shot the wild goose, flying southward"
13066,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"On the wing, the clamorous Wawa;"
13067,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Thinking of the great war-parties,"
13068,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"How they came to buy his arrows,"
13069,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Could not fight without his arrows.
13070,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Ah, no more such noble warriors"
13071,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Could be found on earth as they were!
13072,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Now the men were all like women,"
13073,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Only used their tongues for weapons!
13074,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"She was thinking of a hunter,"
13075,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"From another tribe and country,"
13076,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Young and tall and very handsome,"
13077,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Who one morning, in the Spring-time,"
13078,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Came to buy her father's arrows,"
13079,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sat and rested in the wigwam,"
13080,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Lingered long about the doorway,"
13081,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Looking back as he departed.
13082,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"She had heard her father praise him,"
13083,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Praise his courage and his wisdom;
13084,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Would he come again for arrows
13085,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,To the Falls of Minnehaha?
13086,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"On the mat her hands lay idle,"
13087,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And her eyes were very dreamy.
13088,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Through their thoughts they heard a footstep,"
13089,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Heard a rustling in the branches,"
13090,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And with glowing cheek and forehead,"
13091,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"With the deer upon his shoulders,"
13092,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Suddenly from out the woodlands
13093,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Hiawatha stood before them.
13094,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Straight the ancient Arrow-maker
13095,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Looked up gravely from his labor,"
13096,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Laid aside the unfinished arrow,"
13097,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Bade him enter at the doorway,"
13098,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Saying, as he rose to meet him,"
13099,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"'Hiawatha, you are welcome!"""
13100,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,At the feet of Laughing Water
13101,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Hiawatha laid his burden,"
13102,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Threw the red deer from his shoulders;
13103,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And the maiden looked up at him,"
13104,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Looked up from her mat of rushes,"
13105,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Said with gentle look and accent,"
13106,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""You are welcome, Hiawatha!"""
13107,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Very spacious was the wigwam,"
13108,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Made of deer-skins dressed and whitened,"
13109,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,With the Gods of the Dacotahs
13110,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Drawn and painted on its curtains,"
13111,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And so tall the doorway, hardly"
13112,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Hiawatha stooped to enter,"
13113,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Hardly touched his eagle-feathers
13114,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,As he entered at the doorway.
13115,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Then uprose the Laughing Water,"
13116,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"From the ground fair Minnehaha,"
13117,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Laid aside her mat unfinished,"
13118,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Brought forth food and set before them,"
13119,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Water brought them from the brooklet,"
13120,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Gave them food in earthen vessels,"
13121,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood,"
13122,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Listened while the guest was speaking,"
13123,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Listened while her father answered,"
13124,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"But not once her lips she opened,"
13125,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Not a single word she uttered.
13126,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Yes, as in a dream she listened"
13127,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"To the words of Hiawatha,"
13128,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"As he talked of old Nokomis,"
13129,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Who had nursed him in his childhood,"
13130,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"As he told of his companions,"
13131,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Chibiabos, the musician,"
13132,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And the very strong man, Kwasind,"
13133,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And of happiness and plenty
13134,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"In the land of the Ojibways,"
13135,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,In the pleasant land and peaceful.
13136,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""After many years of warfare,"
13137,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Many years of strife and bloodshed,"
13138,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,There is peace between the Ojibways
13139,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And the tribe of the Dacotahs."""
13140,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Thus continued Hiawatha,"
13141,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And then added, speaking slowly,"
13142,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""That this peace may last forever,"
13143,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And our hands be clasped more closely,"
13144,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And our hearts be more united,"
13145,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Give me as my wife this maiden,"
13146,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Minnehaha, Laughing Water,"
13147,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Loveliest of Dacotah women!"""
13148,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And the ancient Arrow-maker
13149,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Paused a moment ere he answered,"
13150,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Smoked a little while in silence,"
13151,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Looked at Hiawatha proudly,"
13152,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Fondly looked at Laughing Water,"
13153,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And made answer very gravely:
13154,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""Yes, if Minnehaha wishes;"
13155,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!"""
13156,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And the lovely Laughing Water
13157,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Seemed more lovely as she stood there,"
13158,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Neither willing nor reluctant,"
13159,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"As she went to Hiawatha,"
13160,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Softly took the seat beside him,"
13161,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"While she said, and blushed to say it,"
13162,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""I will follow you, my husband!"""
13163,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,This was Hiawatha's wooing!
13164,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Thus it was he won the daughter
13165,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Of the ancient Arrow-maker,"
13166,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,In the land of the Dacotahs!
13167,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"From the wigwam he departed,"
13168,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Leading with him Laughing Water;
13169,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Hand in hand they went together,"
13170,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Through the woodland and the meadow,"
13171,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Left the old man standing lonely
13172,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"At the doorway of his wigwam,"
13173,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
13174,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Calling to them from the distance,"
13175,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Crying to them from afar off,"
13176,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""Fare thee well, O Minnehaha!"""
13177,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And the ancient Arrow-maker
13178,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Turned again unto his labor,"
13179,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sat down by his sunny doorway,"
13180,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Murmuring to himself, and saying:"
13181,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""Thus it is our daughters leave us,"
13182,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Those we love, and those who love us!"
13183,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Just when they have learned to help us,"
13184,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"When we are old and lean upon them,"
13185,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Comes a youth with flaunting feathers,"
13186,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"With his flute of reeds, a stranger"
13187,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Wanders piping through the village,"
13188,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Beckons to the fairest maiden,"
13189,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And she follows where he leads her,"
13190,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Leaving all things for the stranger!"""
13191,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Pleasant was the journey homeward,"
13192,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Through interminable forests,"
13193,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Over meadow, over mountain,"
13194,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Over river, hill, and hollow."
13195,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Short it seemed to Hiawatha,"
13196,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Though they journeyed very slowly,"
13197,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Though his pace he checked and slackened
13198,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,To the steps of Laughing Water.
13199,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Over wide and rushing rivers
13200,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,In his arms he bore the maiden;
13201,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Light he thought her as a feather,"
13202,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,As the plume upon his head-gear;
13203,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Cleared the tangled pathway for her,"
13204,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Bent aside the swaying branches,"
13205,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Made at night a lodge of branches,"
13206,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And a bed with boughs of hemlock,"
13207,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,And a fire before the doorway
13208,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,With the dry cones of the pine-tree.
13209,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"All the travelling winds went with them,"
13210,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"O'er the meadows, through the forest;"
13211,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"All the stars of night looked at them,"
13212,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber;
13213,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,From his ambush in the oak-tree
13214,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo,"
13215,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Watched with eager eyes the lovers;
13216,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"And the rabbit, the Wabasso,"
13217,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Scampered from the path before them,"
13218,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Peering, peeping from his burrow,"
13219,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sat erect upon his haunches,"
13220,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Watched with curious eyes the lovers.
13221,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Pleasant was the journey homeward!
13222,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,All the birds sang loud and sweetly
13223,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,Songs of happiness and heart's-ease;
13224,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,"
13225,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"""Happy are you, Hiawatha,"
13226,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Having such a wife to love you!"""

13229,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Having such a noble husband!"""
13230,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,From the sky the sun benignant
13231,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Looked upon them through the branches,"
13232,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Saying to them, ""O my children,"
13233,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Love is sunshine, hate is shadow,"
13234,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Life is checkered shade and sunshine,"
13235,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Rule by love, O Hiawatha!"""
13236,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"From the sky the moon looked at them,"
13237,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Filled the lodge with mystic splendors,"
13238,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Whispered to them, ""O my children,"
13239,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Day is restless, night is quiet,"
13240,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Man imperious, woman feeble;"

13245,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,To the lodge of old Nokomis
13246,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Brought the moonlight, starlight, firelight,"
13247,HIAWATHA'S WOOING,"Brought the sunshine of his people,"

13328,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Little cared he for their insults,"
13329,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,For the women and the maidens
13330,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Loved the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis.
13331,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"He was dressed in shirt of doeskin,"
13332,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"White and soft, and fringed with ermine,"
13333,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,All inwrought with beads of wampum;
13334,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"He was dressed in deer-skin leggings,"
13335,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Fringed with hedgehog quills and ermine,"
13336,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And in moccasins of buck-skin,"
13337,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thick with quills and beads embroidered.
13338,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"On his head were plumes of swan's down,"
13339,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"On his heels were tails of foxes,"
13340,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"In one hand a fan of feathers,"
13341,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,And a pipe was in the other.
13342,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Barred with streaks of red and yellow,"
13343,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Streaks of blue and bright vermilion,"
13344,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Shone the face of Pau-Puk-Keewis.
13345,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"From his forehead fell his tresses,"
13346,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Smooth, and parted like a woman's,"
13347,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Shining bright with oil, and plaited,"
13348,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Hung with braids of scented grasses,"
13349,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"As among the guests assembled,"
13350,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"To the sound of flutes and singing,"
13351,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"To the sound of drums and voices,"
13352,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Rose the handsome Pau-Puk-Keewis,"
13353,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,And began his mystic dances.
13354,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"First he danced a solemn measure,"
13355,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Very slow in step and gesture,"
13356,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"In and out among the pine-trees,"
13357,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Through the shadows and the sunshine,"
13358,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Treading softly like a panther.
13359,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Then more swiftly and still swifter,"
13360,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Whirling, spinning round in circles,"
13361,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Leaping o'er the guests assembled,"
13362,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Eddying round and round the wigwam,"
13363,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Till the leaves went whirling with him,"
13364,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Till the dust and wind together
13365,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Swept in eddies round about him.
13366,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Then along the sandy margin
13367,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Of the lake, the Big-Sea-Water,"
13368,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"On he sped with frenzied gestures,"
13369,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Stamped upon the sand, and tossed it"
13370,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Wildly in the air around him;
13371,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Till the wind became a whirlwind,"
13372,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Till the sand was blown and sifted
13373,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Like great snowdrifts o'er the landscape,"
13374,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Heaping all the shores with Sand Dunes,"
13375,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Sand Hills of the Nagow Wudjoo!
13376,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thus the merry Pau-Puk-Keewis
13377,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Danced his Beggar's Dance to please them,"
13378,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And, returning, sat down laughing"
13379,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"There among the guests assembled,"
13380,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Sat and fanned himself serenely
13381,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,With his fan of turkey-feathers.
13382,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Then they said to Chibiabos,"
13383,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"To the friend of Hiawatha,"
13384,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"To the sweetest of all singers,"
13385,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"To the best of all musicians,"
13386,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""Sing to us, O Chibiabos!"
13387,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Songs of love and songs of longing,"
13388,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"That the feast may be more joyous,"
13389,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"That the time may pass more gayly,"
13390,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And our guests be more contented!"""
13391,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,And the gentle Chibiabos
13392,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Sang in accents sweet and tender,"
13393,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Sang in tones of deep emotion,"
13394,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Songs of love and songs of longing;
13395,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Looking still at Hiawatha,"
13396,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Looking at fair Laughing Water,"
13397,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Sang he softly, sang in this wise:"
13398,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""Onaway!  Awake, beloved!"
13399,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thou the wild-flower of the forest!
13400,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thou the wild-bird of the prairie!
13401,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thou with eyes so soft and fawn-like!
13402,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""If thou only lookest at me,"
13403,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"I am happy, I am happy,"
13404,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"As the lilies of the prairie,"
13405,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,When they feel the dew upon them!
13406,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""Sweet thy breath is as the fragrance"
13407,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Of the wild-flowers in the morning,"
13408,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"As their fragrance is at evening,"
13409,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,In the Moon when leaves are falling.
13410,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""Does not all the blood within me"
13411,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Leap to meet thee, leap to meet thee,"
13412,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"As the springs to meet the sunshine,"
13413,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,In the Moon when nights are brightest?
13414,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""Onaway! my heart sings to thee,"
13415,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Sings with joy when thou art near me,"
13416,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"As the sighing, singing branches"
13417,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,In the pleasant Moon of Strawberries!
13418,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""When thou art not pleased, beloved,"
13419,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Then my heart is sad and darkened,"
13420,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,As the shining river darkens
13421,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,When the clouds drop shadows on it!
13422,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""When thou smilest, my beloved,"
13423,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Then my troubled heart is brightened,"
13424,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,As in sunshine gleam the ripples
13425,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,That the cold wind makes in rivers.
13426,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""Smiles the earth, and smile the waters,"
13427,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Smile the cloudless skies above us,"
13428,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,But I lose the way of smiling
13429,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,When thou art no longer near me!
13430,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""I myself, myself! behold me!"
13431,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Blood of my beating heart, behold me!"
13432,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Oh awake, awake, beloved!"
13433,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Onaway! awake, beloved!"""
13434,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thus the gentle Chibiabos
13435,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Sang his song of love and longing;
13436,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And Iagoo, the great boaster,"
13437,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"He the marvellous story-teller,"
13438,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"He the friend of old Nokomis,"
13439,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Jealous of the sweet musician,"
13440,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Jealous of the applause they gave him,"
13441,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Saw in all the eyes around him,"
13442,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Saw in all their looks and gestures,"
13443,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,That the wedding guests assembled
13444,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Longed to hear his pleasant stories,"
13445,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,His immeasurable falsehoods.
13446,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Very boastful was Iagoo;
13447,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Never heard he an adventure
13448,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,But himself had met a greater;
13449,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Never any deed of daring
13450,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,But himself had done a bolder;
13451,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Never any marvellous story
13452,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,But himself could tell a stranger.
13453,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Would you listen to his boasting,"
13454,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Would you only give him credence,"
13455,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,No one ever shot an arrow
13456,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Half so far and high as he had;
13457,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Ever caught so many fishes,"
13458,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Ever killed so many reindeer,"
13459,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Ever trapped so many beaver!
13460,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"None could run so fast as he could,"
13461,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"None could dive so deep as he could,"
13462,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,None could swim so far as he could;
13463,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"None had made so many journeys,"
13464,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"None had seen so many wonders,"
13465,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"As this wonderful Iagoo,"
13466,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,As this marvellous story-teller!
13467,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Thus his name became a by-word
13468,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,And a jest among the people;
13469,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,And whene'er a boastful hunter
13470,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Praised his own address too highly,"
13471,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Or a warrior, home returning,"
13472,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Talked too much of his achievements,"
13473,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"All his hearers cried, ""Iagoo!"
13474,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Here's Iagoo come among us!"""
13475,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,He it was who carved the cradle
13476,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Of the little Hiawatha,"
13477,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Carved its framework out of linden,"
13478,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Bound it strong with reindeer sinews;
13479,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,He it was who taught him later
13480,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"How to make his bows and arrows,"
13481,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"How to make the bows of ash-tree,"
13482,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,And the arrows of the oak-tree.
13483,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,So among the guests assembled
13484,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,At my Hiawatha's wedding
13485,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Sat Iagoo, old and ugly,"
13486,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,Sat the marvellous story-teller.
13487,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And they said, ""O good Iagoo,"
13488,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Tell us now a tale of wonder,"
13489,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Tell us of some strange adventure,"
13490,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"That the feast may be more joyous,"
13491,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"That the time may pass more gayly,"
13492,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And our guests be more contented!"""
13493,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"And Iagoo answered straightway,"
13494,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"""You shall hear a tale of wonder,"
13495,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,You shall hear the strange adventures
13496,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"Of Osseo, the Magician,"
13497,HIAWATHA'S WEDDING-FEAST,"From the Evening Star descending."""

13503,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR
13504,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,
13505,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Can it be the sun descending
13506,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,O'er the level plain of water?
13507,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Or the Red Swan floating, flying,"
13508,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Wounded by the magic arrow,"
13509,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Staining all the waves with crimson,"
13510,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"With the crimson of its life-blood,"
13511,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Filling all the air with splendor,"
13512,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,With the splendor of its plumage?
13513,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Yes; it is the sun descending,"
13514,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Sinking down into the water;
13515,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All the sky is stained with purple,"
13516,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,All the water flushed with crimson!
13517,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"No; it is the Red Swan floating,"
13518,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Diving down beneath the water;
13519,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"To the sky its wings are lifted,"
13520,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,With its blood the waves are reddened!
13521,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Over it the Star of Evening
13522,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Melts and trembles through the purple,"
13523,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Hangs suspended in the twilight.
13524,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,No; it is a bead of wampum
13525,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,On the robes of the Great Spirit
13526,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"As he passes through the twilight,"
13527,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Walks in silence through the heavens.
13528,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,This with joy beheld Iagoo
13529,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And he said in haste: ""Behold it!"
13530,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,See the sacred Star of Evening!
13531,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"You shall hear a tale of wonder,"
13532,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Hear the story of Osseo,"
13533,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Son of the Evening Star, Osseo!"
13534,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Once, in days no more remembered,"
13535,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Ages nearer the beginning,"
13536,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"When the heavens were closer to us,"
13537,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And the Gods were more familiar,"
13538,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"In the North-land lived a hunter,"
13539,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"With ten young and comely daughters,"
13540,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Tall and lithe as wands of willow;
13541,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Only Oweenee, the youngest,"
13542,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"She the wilful and the wayward,"
13543,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"She the silent, dreamy maiden,"
13544,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Was the fairest of the sisters.
13545,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""All these women married warriors,"
13546,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Married brave and haughty husbands;
13547,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Only Oweenee, the youngest,"
13548,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Laughed and flouted all her lovers,"
13549,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All her young and handsome suitors,"
13550,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And then married old Osseo,"
13551,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Old Osseo, poor and ugly,"
13552,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Broken with age and weak with coughing,"
13553,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Always coughing like a squirrel.
13554,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Ah, but beautiful within him"
13555,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Was the spirit of Osseo,"
13556,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"From the Evening Star descended,"
13557,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Star of Evening, Star of Woman,"
13558,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Star of tenderness and passion!
13559,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All its fire was in his bosom,"
13560,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All its beauty in his spirit,"
13561,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All its mystery in his being,"
13562,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,All its splendor in his language!
13563,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""And her lovers, the rejected,"
13564,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Handsome men with belts of wampum,"
13565,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Handsome men with paint and feathers.
13566,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Pointed at her in derision,"
13567,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Followed her with jest and laughter.
13568,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"But she said: 'I care not for you,"
13569,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Care not for your belts of wampum,"
13570,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Care not for your paint and feathers,"
13571,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Care not for your jests and laughter;
13572,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,I am happy with Osseo!'
13573,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Once to some great feast invited,"
13574,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Through the damp and dusk of evening,"
13575,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Walked together the ten sisters,"
13576,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Walked together with their husbands;
13577,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Slowly followed old Osseo,"
13578,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,With fair Oweenee beside him;
13579,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All the others chatted gayly,"
13580,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,These two only walked in silence.
13581,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""At the western sky Osseo"
13582,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Gazed intent, as if imploring,"
13583,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Often stopped and gazed imploring
13584,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"At the trembling Star of Evening,"
13585,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,At the tender Star of Woman;
13586,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And they heard him murmur softly,"
13587,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"'Ah, showain nemeshin, Nosa!"
13588,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Pity, pity me, my father!'"
13589,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""'Listen!' said the eldest sister,"
13590,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,'He is praying to his father!

13592,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Does not stumble in the pathway,"
13593,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Does not break his neck by falling!'
13594,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And they laughed till all the forest
13595,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Rang with their unseemly laughter.
13596,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""On their pathway through the woodlands"
13597,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Lay an oak, by storms uprooted,"
13598,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Lay the great trunk of an oak-tree,"
13599,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Buried half in leaves and mosses,"
13600,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Mouldering, crumbling, huge and hollow."
13601,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And Osseo, when he saw it,"
13602,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Gave a shout, a cry of anguish,"
13603,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Leaped into its yawning cavern,"
13604,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"At one end went in an old man,"
13605,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly;"
13606,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"From the other came a young man,"
13607,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Tall and straight and strong and handsome.
13608,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Thus Osseo was transfigured,"
13609,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Thus restored to youth and beauty;
13610,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"But, alas for good Osseo,"
13611,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And for Oweenee, the faithful!"
13612,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Strangely, too, was she transfigured."
13613,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Changed into a weak old woman,"
13614,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"With a staff she tottered onward,"
13615,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly!"
13616,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And the sisters and their husbands
13617,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Laughed until the echoing forest
13618,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Rang with their unseemly laughter.
13619,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""But Osseo turned not from her,"
13620,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Walked with slower step beside her,"
13621,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Took her hand, as brown and withered"
13622,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"As an oak-leaf is in Winter,"
13623,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Called her sweetheart, Nenemoosha,"
13624,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Soothed her with soft words of kindness,"
13625,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Till they reached the lodge of feasting,"
13626,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Till they sat down in the wigwam,"
13627,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Sacred to the Star of Evening,"
13628,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,To the tender Star of Woman.
13629,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Wrapt in visions, lost in dreaming,"
13630,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,At the banquet sat Osseo;
13631,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All were merry, all were happy,"
13632,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,All were joyous but Osseo.
13633,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Neither food nor drink he tasted,"
13634,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Neither did he speak nor listen;
13635,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"But as one bewildered sat he,"
13636,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Looking dreamily and sadly,"
13637,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"First at Oweenee, then upward"
13638,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,At the gleaming sky above them.
13639,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Then a voice was heard, a whisper,"

13642,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Low, and musical, and tender;"
13643,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And the voice said: 'O Osseo!
13644,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"O my son, my best beloved!"
13645,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Broken are the spells that bound you,"
13646,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"All the charms of the magicians,"
13647,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,All the magic powers of evil;

13653,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,All your bowls and all your kettles
13654,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Shall be wood and clay no longer;
13655,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"But the bowls be changed to wampum,"
13656,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And the kettles shall be silver;
13657,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"They shall shine like shells of scarlet,"

13663,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Painted with the dusky splendors
13664,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Of the skies and clouds of evening!'
13665,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""What Osseo heard as whispers,"
13666,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"What as words he comprehended,"
13667,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Was but music to the others,"
13668,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Music as of birds afar off,"
13669,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Of the whippoorwill afar off,"
13670,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Of the lonely Wawonaissa
13671,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Singing in the darksome forest.
13672,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Then the lodge began to tremble,"

13683,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And the roof-poles of the wigwam
13684,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Were as glittering rods of silver,"
13685,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And the roof of bark upon them
13686,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,As the shining shards of beetles.
13687,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Then Osseo gazed around him,"

13699,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Wasted, wrinkled, old, and ugly,"
13700,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Looking sadly at the others;
13701,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Till Osseo, gazing upward,"
13702,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Gave another cry of anguish,"
13703,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Such a cry as he had uttered
13704,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,By the oak-tree in the forest.
13705,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Then returned her youth and beauty,"
13706,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And her soiled and tattered garments

13713,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,And amid celestial splendors
13714,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"On the Evening Star alighted,"
13715,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"As a snow-flake falls on snow-flake,"
13716,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"As a leaf drops on a river,"
13717,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,As the thistledown on water.
13718,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"""Forth with cheerful words of welcome"
13719,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Came the father of Osseo,"
13720,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"He with radiant locks of silver,"
13721,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,He with eyes serene and tender.
13722,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And he said: 'My son, Osseo,"

13729,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Listened to Osseo's father,"
13730,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Ruler of the Star of Evening,"
13731,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,As he said: 'O my Osseo!
13732,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"I have had compassion on you,"
13733,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Given you back your youth and beauty,"
13734,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Into birds of various plumage
13735,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Changed your sisters and their husbands;
13736,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Changed them thus because they mocked you
13737,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"In the figure of the old man,"
13738,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"In that aspect sad and wrinkled,"
13739,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Could not see your heart of passion,"
13740,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Could not see your youth immortal;
13741,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Only Oweenee, the faithful,"
13742,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Saw your naked heart and loved you.

13747,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"The Wabeno, the magician,"
13748,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Who transformed you to an old man.
13749,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Take heed lest his beams fall on you,"
13750,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,For the rays he darts around him
13751,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Are the power of his enchantment,"
13752,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,Are the arrows that he uses.'

13777,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"Shot a swift and fatal arrow,"
13778,THE SON OF THE EVENING STAR,"And a bird, with shining feathers,"

14087,BLESSING THE CORNFIELDS,In uninterrupted silence
14088,BLESSING THE CORNFIELDS,Looked they at the gamesome labor

14347,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Right across the Big-Sea-Water
14348,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Sprang with speed the deer before him.
14349,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"With the wind and snow he followed,"
14350,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"O'er the treacherous ice he followed,"
14351,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Wild with all the fierce commotion
14352,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And the rapture of the hunting.
14353,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"But beneath, the Evil Spirits"
14354,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Lay in ambush, waiting for him,"
14355,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Broke the treacherous ice beneath him,"
14356,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Dragged him downward to the bottom,"
14357,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Buried in the sand his body.
14358,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Unktahee, the god of water,"
14359,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"He the god of the Dacotahs,"
14360,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Drowned him in the deep abysses
14361,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Of the lake of Gitche Gumee.
14362,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,From the headlands Hiawatha
14363,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Sent forth such a wail of anguish,"
14364,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Such a fearful lamentation,"
14365,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"That the bison paused to listen,"
14366,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"And the wolves howled from the prairies,"
14367,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And the thunder in the distance
14368,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Starting answered ""Baim-wawa!"""
14369,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Then his face with black he painted,"
14370,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"With his robe his head he covered,"
14371,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"In his wigwam sat lamenting,"
14372,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Seven long weeks he sat lamenting,"
14373,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Uttering still this moan of sorrow:--
14374,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"""He is dead, the sweet musician!"
14375,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,He the sweetest of all singers!
14376,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"He has gone from us forever,"

14378,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"To the Master of all music,"

14381,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And the melancholy fir-trees

14383,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Waved their purple cones above him,"
14384,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Sighing with him to console him,"
14385,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Mingling with his lamentation
14386,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Their complaining, their lamenting."
14387,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Came the Spring, and all the forest"
14388,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Looked in vain for Chibiabos;
14389,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Sighed the rivulet, Sebowisha,"
14390,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Sighed the rushes in the meadow.
14391,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"From the tree-tops sang the bluebird,"
14392,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Sang the bluebird, the Owaissa,"
14393,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"""Chibiabos! Chibiabos!"
14394,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"He is dead, the sweet musician!"""
14395,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"From the wigwam sang the robin,"

14399,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And at night through all the forest

14401,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Wailing went the Wawonaissa,"
14402,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"""Chibiabos! Chibiabos!"

14408,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Came to visit Hiawatha;
14409,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Built a Sacred Lodge beside him,"
14410,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"To appease him, to console him,"
14411,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Walked in silent, grave procession,"
14412,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Bearing each a pouch of healing,"
14413,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Skin of beaver, lynx, or otter,"
14414,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Filled with magic roots and simples,"

14419,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Naught he questioned, naught he answered,"
14420,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"But his mournful head uncovered,"
14421,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,From his face the mourning colors
14422,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Washed he slowly and in silence,"
14423,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Slowly and in silence followed
14424,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Onward to the Sacred Wigwam.
14425,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"There a magic drink they gave him,"
14426,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Made of Nahma-wusk, the spearmint,"

14462,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"O'er the head of Hiawatha,"
14463,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Danced their medicine-dance around him;
14464,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"And upstarting wild and haggard,"
14465,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Like a man from dreams awakened,"
14466,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,He was healed of all his madness.
14467,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"As the clouds are swept from heaven,"
14468,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Straightway from his brain departed
14469,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,All his moody melancholy;
14470,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"As the ice is swept from rivers,"
14471,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Straightway from his heart departed
14472,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,All his sorrow and affliction.
14473,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Then they summoned Chibiabos
14474,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"From his grave beneath the waters,"
14475,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,From the sands of Gitche Gumee
14476,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Summoned Hiawatha's brother.
14477,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And so mighty was the magic
14478,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Of that cry and invocation,"
14479,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,That he heard it as he lay there
14480,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Underneath the Big-Sea-Water;
14481,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"From the sand he rose and listened,"
14482,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Heard the music and the singing,"
14483,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Came, obedient to the summons,"
14484,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"To the doorway of the wigwam,"
14485,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,But to enter they forbade him.
14486,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Through a chink a coal they gave him,"
14487,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Through the door a burning fire-brand;
14488,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Ruler in the Land of Spirits,"
14489,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Ruler o'er the dead, they made him,"
14490,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Telling him a fire to kindle

14495,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,To the land of the Hereafter.
14496,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"From the village of his childhood,"
14497,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"From the homes of those who knew him,"
14498,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Passing silent through the forest,"
14499,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Like a smoke-wreath wafted sideways,"
14500,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Slowly vanished Chibiabos!

14502,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Where he trod, the grasses bent not,"
14503,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And the fallen leaves of last year
14504,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Made no sound beneath his footstep.
14505,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Four whole days he journeyed onward
14506,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,Down the pathway of the dead men;
14507,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"On the dead-man's strawberry feasted,"
14508,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Crossed the melancholy river,"
14509,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"On the swinging log he crossed it,"
14510,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Came unto the Lake of Silver,"
14511,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,In the Stone Canoe was carried
14512,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"To the Islands of the Blessed,"
14513,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,To the land of ghosts and shadows.
14514,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"On that journey, moving slowly,"
14515,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Many weary spirits saw he,"
14516,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Panting under heavy burdens,"
14517,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Laden with war-clubs, bows and arrows,"
14518,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Robes of fur, and pots and kettles,"
14519,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,And with food that friends had given
14520,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,For that solitary journey.
14521,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"""Ay! why do the living,"" said they,"
14522,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"""Lay such heavy burdens on us!"
14523,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Better were it to go naked,"
14524,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Better were it to go fasting,"

14526,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"On our long and weary journey!"""
14527,HIAWATHA'S LAMENTATION,"Forth then issued Hiawatha,"

14648,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Must have very nimble fingers;
14649,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Though you think yourself so skilful,"
14650,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"I can beat you, Pau-Puk-Keewis,"
14651,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,I can even give you lessons
14652,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"In your game of Bowl and Counters!"""
14653,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"So they sat and played together,"
14654,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"All the old men and the young men,"
14655,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Played for dresses, weapons, wampum,"
14656,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Played till midnight, played till morning,"
14657,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Played until the Yenadizze,"
14658,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Till the cunning Pau-Puk-Keewis,"
14659,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Of their treasures had despoiled them,"
14660,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Of the best of all their dresses,"
14661,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Shirts of deer-skin, robes of ermine,"
14662,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Belts of wampum, crests of feathers,"
14663,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Warlike weapons, pipes and pouches."
14664,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Twenty eyes glared wildly at him,"
14665,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Like the eyes of wolves glared at him.
14666,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Said the lucky Pau-Puk-Keewis:
14667,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"""In my wigwam I am lonely,"

14671,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,An attendant and pipe-bearer.
14672,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"I will venture all these winnings,"
14673,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"All these garments heaped about me,"
14674,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"All this wampum, all these feathers,"

14677,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"'T was a youth of sixteen summers,"

14679,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Face-in-a-Mist, the people called him."
14680,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,As the fire burns in a pipe-head
14681,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Dusky red beneath the ashes,"
14682,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,So beneath his shaggy eyebrows
14683,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Glowed the eyes of old Iagoo.
14684,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"""Ugh!"" he answered very fiercely;"
14685,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"""Ugh!"" they answered all and each one."
14686,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Seized the wooden bowl the old man,"
14687,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Closely in his bony fingers
14688,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Clutched the fatal bowl, Onagon,"
14689,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Shook it fiercely and with fury,"
14690,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Made the pieces ring together
14691,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,As he threw them down before him.
14692,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Red were both the great Kenabeeks,"
14693,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Red the Ininewug, the wedge-men,"
14694,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Red the Sheshebwug, the ducklings,"

14696,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"White alone the fish, the Keego;"
14697,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Only five the pieces counted!
14698,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Then the smiling Pau-Puk-Keewis
14699,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Shook the bowl and threw the pieces;
14700,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Lightly in the air he tossed them,"
14701,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,And they fell about him scattered;

14703,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Red and white the other pieces,"
14704,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,And upright among the others
14705,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"One Ininewug was standing,"
14706,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Even as crafty Pau-Puk-Keewis
14707,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Stood alone among the players,"
14708,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Saying, ""Five tens! mine the game is!"""

14722,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Hot and red with smoke and gambling

14724,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,As he came forth to the freshness
14725,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Of the pleasant Summer morning.
14726,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"All the birds were singing gayly,"
14727,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"All the streamlets flowing swiftly,"
14728,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,And the heart of Pau-Puk-Keewis
14729,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Sang with pleasure as the birds sing,"
14730,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Beat with triumph like the streamlets,"
14731,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"As he wandered through the village,"
14732,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"In the early gray of morning,"
14733,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"With his fan of turkey-feathers,"
14734,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"With his plumes and tufts of swan's down,"
14735,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Till he reached the farthest wigwam,"
14736,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Reached the lodge of Hiawatha.
14737,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Silent was it and deserted;
14738,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"No one met him at the doorway,"
14739,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,No one came to bid him welcome;
14740,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"But the birds were singing round it,"

14742,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Hopping, singing, fluttering, feeding,"
14743,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,And aloft upon the ridge-pole
14744,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Kahgahgee, the King of Ravens,"
14745,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Sat with fiery eyes, and, screaming,"
14746,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Flapped his wings at Pau-Puk-Keewis.
14747,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"""All are gone! the lodge is empty!"""
14748,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Thus it was spake Pau-Puk-Keewis,"

14758,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,From the ridge-pole of the wigwam
14759,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Left its lifeless body hanging,"
14760,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"As an insult to its master,"
14761,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,As a taunt to Hiawatha.
14762,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"With a stealthy step he entered,"
14763,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Round the lodge in wild disorder
14764,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Threw the household things about him,"
14765,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Piled together in confusion
14766,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Bowls of wood and earthen kettles,"
14767,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Robes of buffalo and beaver,"
14768,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Skins of otter, lynx, and ermine,"
14769,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"As an insult to Nokomis,"
14770,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,As a taunt to Minnehaha.
14771,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Then departed Pau-Puk-Keewis,"
14772,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Whistling, singing through the forest,"
14773,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Whistling gayly to the squirrels,"
14774,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Who from hollow boughs above him
14775,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Dropped their acorn-shells upon him,"
14776,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Singing gayly to the wood birds,"
14777,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Who from out the leafy darkness
14778,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Answered with a song as merry.
14779,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Then he climbed the rocky headlands,"
14780,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Looking o'er the Gitche Gumee,"
14781,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Perched himself upon their summit,"
14782,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Waiting full of mirth and mischief
14783,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,The return of Hiawatha.
14784,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Stretched upon his back he lay there;
14785,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Far below him plashed the waters,"
14786,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,Plashed and washed the dreamy waters;
14787,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Far above him swam the heavens,"

14793,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"And he killed them as he lay there,"
14794,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Slaughtered them by tens and twenties,"
14795,PAU-PUK-KEEWIS,"Threw their bodies down the headland,"

15191,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"""If this great, outrageous fellow"
15192,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Goes on thus a little longer,"
15193,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Tearing everything he touches,"
15194,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Rending everything to pieces,"
15195,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Filling all the world with wonder,"
15196,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,What becomes of the Puk-Wudjies?
15197,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Who will care for the Puk-Wudjies?
15198,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"He will tread us down like mushrooms,"
15199,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Drive us all into the water,"
15200,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Give our bodies to be eaten
15201,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"By the wicked Nee-ba-naw-baigs,"
15202,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,By the Spirits of the water!
15203,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,So the angry Little People
15204,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"All conspired against the Strong Man,"
15205,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"All conspired to murder Kwasind,"
15206,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Yes, to rid the world of Kwasind,"
15207,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"The audacious, overbearing,"
15208,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Heartless, haughty, dangerous Kwasind!"
15209,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Now this wondrous strength of Kwasind
15210,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,In his crown alone was seated;
15211,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,In his crown too was his weakness;
15212,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"There alone could he be wounded,"
15213,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Nowhere else could weapon pierce him,"
15214,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Nowhere else could weapon harm him.
15215,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Even there the only weapon
15216,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"That could wound him, that could slay him,"
15217,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Was the seed-cone of the pine-tree,"
15218,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Was the blue cone of the fir-tree.
15219,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"This was Kwasind's fatal secret,"
15220,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Known to no man among mortals;
15221,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"But the cunning Little People,"
15222,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"The Puk-Wudjies, knew the secret,"
15223,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Knew the only way to kill him.
15224,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"So they gathered cones together,"
15225,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Gathered seed-cones of the pine-tree,"
15226,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Gathered blue cones of the fir-tree,"
15227,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"In the woods by Taquamenaw,"
15228,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Brought them to the river's margin,"
15229,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Heaped them in great piles together,"
15230,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Where the red rocks from the margin
15231,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Jutting overhang the river.
15232,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"There they lay in wait for Kwasind,"
15233,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,The malicious Little People.
15234,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,'T was an afternoon in Summer;
15235,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Very hot and still the air was,"
15236,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Very smooth the gliding river,"
15237,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Motionless the sleeping shadows:
15238,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Insects glistened in the sunshine,"
15239,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Insects skated on the water,"
15240,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Filled the drowsy air with buzzing,"
15241,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,With a far resounding war-cry.
15242,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Down the river came the Strong Man,"
15243,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"In his birch canoe came Kwasind,"
15244,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Floating slowly down the current
15245,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Of the sluggish Taquamenaw,"
15246,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Very languid with the weather,"
15247,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Very sleepy with the silence.
15248,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"From the overhanging branches,"
15249,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"From the tassels of the birch-trees,"
15250,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Soft the Spirit of Sleep descended;
15251,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"By his airy hosts surrounded,"
15252,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"His invisible attendants,"
15253,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Came the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin;"
15254,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Like a burnished Dush-kwo-ne-she,"
15255,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Like a dragon-fly, he hovered"
15256,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,O'er the drowsy head of Kwasind.
15257,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,To his ear there came a murmur
15258,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"As of waves upon a sea-shore,"
15259,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"As of far-off tumbling waters,"
15260,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,As of winds among the pine-trees;
15261,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,And he felt upon his forehead
15262,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Blows of little airy war-clubs,"
15263,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Wielded by the slumbrous legions
15264,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Of the Spirit of Sleep, Nepahwin,"
15265,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,As of some one breathing on him.
15266,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"At the first blow of their war-clubs,"
15267,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Fell a drowsiness on Kwasind;
15268,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"At the second blow they smote him,"
15269,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Motionless his paddle rested;
15270,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"At the third, before his vision"
15271,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Reeled the landscape into darkness,"
15272,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Very sound asleep was Kwasind.
15273,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"So he floated down the river,"
15274,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Like a blind man seated upright,"
15275,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Floated down the Taquamenaw,"
15276,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Underneath the trembling birch-trees,"
15277,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Underneath the wooded headlands,"
15278,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Underneath the war encampment
15279,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Of the pygmies, the Puk-Wudjies."
15280,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"There they stood, all armed and waiting,"
15281,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Hurled the pine-cones down upon him,"
15282,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Struck him on his brawny shoulders,"
15283,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,On his crown defenceless struck him.
15284,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"""Death to Kwasind!"" was the sudden"
15285,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,War-cry of the Little People.
15286,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"And he sideways swayed and tumbled,"
15287,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Sideways fell into the river,"
15288,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Plunged beneath the sluggish water
15289,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Headlong, as an otter plunges;"
15290,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"And the birch canoe, abandoned,"
15291,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Drifted empty down the river,"
15292,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Bottom upward swerved and drifted:
15293,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,Nothing more was seen of Kwasind.
15294,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,But the memory of the Strong Man
15295,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Lingered long among the people,"
15296,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,And whenever through the forest
15297,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Raged and roared the wintry tempest,"
15298,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"And the branches, tossed and troubled,"
15299,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"Creaked and groaned and split asunder,"
15300,THE DEATH OF KWASIND,"""Kwasind!"" cried they; ""that is Kwasind!"

15311,THE GHOSTS,"On the sick or wounded bison,"
15312,THE GHOSTS,"But another vulture, watching"
15313,THE GHOSTS,"From his high aerial look-out,"
15314,THE GHOSTS,"Sees the downward plunge, and follows;"
15315,THE GHOSTS,"And a third pursues the second,"
15316,THE GHOSTS,"Coming from the invisible ether,"
15317,THE GHOSTS,"First a speck, and then a vulture,"
15318,THE GHOSTS,Till the air is dark with pinions.
15319,THE GHOSTS,So disasters come not singly;
15320,THE GHOSTS,"But as if they watched and waited,"
15321,THE GHOSTS,"Scanning one another's motions,"
15322,THE GHOSTS,"When the first descends, the others"
15323,THE GHOSTS,"Follow, follow, gathering flock-wise"
15324,THE GHOSTS,"Round their victim, sick and wounded,"
15325,THE GHOSTS,"First a shadow, then a sorrow,"
15326,THE GHOSTS,Till the air is dark with anguish.
15327,THE GHOSTS,"Now, o'er all the dreary North-land,"
15328,THE GHOSTS,"Mighty Peboan, the Winter,"
15329,THE GHOSTS,"Breathing on the lakes and rivers,"
15330,THE GHOSTS,Into stone had changed their waters.
15331,THE GHOSTS,"From his hair he shook the snow-flakes,"
15332,THE GHOSTS,"Till the plains were strewn with whiteness,"
15333,THE GHOSTS,"One uninterrupted level,"
15334,THE GHOSTS,"As if, stooping, the Creator"
15335,THE GHOSTS,With his hand had smoothed them over.
15336,THE GHOSTS,"Through the forest, wide and wailing,"
15337,THE GHOSTS,Roamed the hunter on his snow-shoes;
15338,THE GHOSTS,"In the village worked the women,"
15339,THE GHOSTS,"Pounded maize, or dressed the deer-skin;"
15340,THE GHOSTS,And the young men played together
15341,THE GHOSTS,"On the ice the noisy ball-play,"
15342,THE GHOSTS,On the plain the dance of snow-shoes.
15343,THE GHOSTS,"One dark evening, after sundown,"
15344,THE GHOSTS,In her wigwam Laughing Water
15345,THE GHOSTS,"Sat with old Nokomis, waiting"
15346,THE GHOSTS,For the steps of Hiawatha
15347,THE GHOSTS,Homeward from the hunt returning.
15348,THE GHOSTS,"On their faces gleamed the firelight,"
15349,THE GHOSTS,"Painting them with streaks of crimson,"
15350,THE GHOSTS,In the eyes of old Nokomis
15351,THE GHOSTS,"Glimmered like the watery moonlight,"
15352,THE GHOSTS,In the eyes of Laughing Water
15353,THE GHOSTS,Glistened like the sun in water;
15354,THE GHOSTS,And behind them crouched their shadows
15355,THE GHOSTS,"In the corners of the wigwam,"
15356,THE GHOSTS,And the smoke in wreaths above them
15357,THE GHOSTS,Climbed and crowded through the smoke-flue.
15358,THE GHOSTS,Then the curtain of the doorway
15359,THE GHOSTS,From without was slowly lifted;
15360,THE GHOSTS,"Brighter glowed the fire a moment,"
15361,THE GHOSTS,"And a moment swerved the smoke-wreath,"
15362,THE GHOSTS,"As two women entered softly,"
15363,THE GHOSTS,"Passed the doorway uninvited,"
15364,THE GHOSTS,"Without word of salutation,"
15365,THE GHOSTS,"Without sign of recognition,"
15366,THE GHOSTS,"Sat down in the farthest corner,"
15367,THE GHOSTS,Crouching low among the shadows.
15368,THE GHOSTS,"From their aspect and their garments,"
15369,THE GHOSTS,Strangers seemed they in the village;
15370,THE GHOSTS,"Very pale and haggard were they,"
15371,THE GHOSTS,"As they sat there sad and silent,"
15372,THE GHOSTS,"Trembling, cowering with the shadows."
15373,THE GHOSTS,"Was it the wind above the smoke-flue,"
15374,THE GHOSTS,Muttering down into the wigwam?
15375,THE GHOSTS,"Was it the owl, the Koko-koho,"
15376,THE GHOSTS,Hooting from the dismal forest?
15377,THE GHOSTS,Sure a voice said in the silence:
15378,THE GHOSTS,"""These are corpses clad in garments,"
15379,THE GHOSTS,"These are ghosts that come to haunt you,"
15380,THE GHOSTS,"From the kingdom of Ponemah,"
15381,THE GHOSTS,"From the land of the Hereafter!"""
15382,THE GHOSTS,Homeward now came Hiawatha
15383,THE GHOSTS,"From his hunting in the forest,"
15384,THE GHOSTS,"With the snow upon his tresses,"
15385,THE GHOSTS,And the red deer on his shoulders.
15386,THE GHOSTS,At the feet of Laughing Water
15387,THE GHOSTS,Down he threw his lifeless burden;
15388,THE GHOSTS,"Nobler, handsomer she thought him,"
15389,THE GHOSTS,"Than when first he came to woo her,"
15390,THE GHOSTS,"First threw down the deer before her,"
15391,THE GHOSTS,"As a token of his wishes,"
15392,THE GHOSTS,As a promise of the future.
15393,THE GHOSTS,"Then he turned and saw the strangers,"
15394,THE GHOSTS,"Cowering, crouching with the shadows;"
15395,THE GHOSTS,"Said within himself, ""Who are they?"
15396,THE GHOSTS,"What strange guests has Minnehaha?"""
15397,THE GHOSTS,"But he questioned not the strangers,"
15398,THE GHOSTS,Only spake to bid them welcome
15399,THE GHOSTS,"To his lodge, his food, his fireside."
15400,THE GHOSTS,"When the evening meal was ready,"
15401,THE GHOSTS,"And the deer had been divided,"
15402,THE GHOSTS,"Both the pallid guests, the strangers,"
15403,THE GHOSTS,"Springing from among the shadows,"
15404,THE GHOSTS,"Seized upon the choicest portions,"
15405,THE GHOSTS,"Seized the white fat of the roebuck,"
15406,THE GHOSTS,"Set apart for Laughing Water,"
15407,THE GHOSTS,For the wife of Hiawatha;
15408,THE GHOSTS,"Without asking, without thanking,"
15409,THE GHOSTS,"Eagerly devoured the morsels,"
15410,THE GHOSTS,Flitted back among the shadows
15411,THE GHOSTS,In the corner of the wigwam.
15412,THE GHOSTS,"Not a word spake Hiawatha,"
15413,THE GHOSTS,"Not a motion made Nokomis,"
15414,THE GHOSTS,Not a gesture Laughing Water;
15415,THE GHOSTS,Not a change came o'er their features;
15416,THE GHOSTS,Only Minnehaha softly
15417,THE GHOSTS,"Whispered, saying, ""They are famished;"
15418,THE GHOSTS,Let them do what best delights them;
15419,THE GHOSTS,"Let them eat, for they are famished."""
15420,THE GHOSTS,"Many a daylight dawned and darkened,"
15421,THE GHOSTS,Many a night shook off the daylight
15422,THE GHOSTS,As the pine shakes off the snow-flakes
15423,THE GHOSTS,From the midnight of its branches;
15424,THE GHOSTS,Day by day the guests unmoving
15425,THE GHOSTS,Sat there silent in the wigwam;
15426,THE GHOSTS,"But by night, in storm or starlight,"
15427,THE GHOSTS,"Forth they went into the forest,"
15428,THE GHOSTS,"Bringing fire-wood to the wigwam,"
15429,THE GHOSTS,"Bringing pine-cones for the burning,"
15430,THE GHOSTS,Always sad and always silent.
15431,THE GHOSTS,And whenever Hiawatha
15432,THE GHOSTS,"Came from fishing or from hunting,"
15433,THE GHOSTS,"When the evening meal was ready,"
15434,THE GHOSTS,"And the food had been divided,"
15435,THE GHOSTS,"Gliding from their darksome corner,"
15436,THE GHOSTS,"Came the pallid guests, the strangers,"
15437,THE GHOSTS,Seized upon the choicest portions
15438,THE GHOSTS,"Set aside for Laughing Water,"
15439,THE GHOSTS,And without rebuke or question
15440,THE GHOSTS,Flitted back among the shadows.
15441,THE GHOSTS,Never once had Hiawatha
15442,THE GHOSTS,By a word or look reproved them;
15443,THE GHOSTS,Never once had old Nokomis
15444,THE GHOSTS,Made a gesture of impatience;
15445,THE GHOSTS,Never once had Laughing Water
15446,THE GHOSTS,Shown resentment at the outrage.
15447,THE GHOSTS,"All had they endured in silence,"
15448,THE GHOSTS,"That the rights of guest and stranger,"
15449,THE GHOSTS,"That the virtue of free-giving,"
15450,THE GHOSTS,"By a look might not be lessened,"
15451,THE GHOSTS,By a word might not be broken.
15452,THE GHOSTS,"Once at midnight Hiawatha,"
15453,THE GHOSTS,"Ever wakeful, ever watchful,"
15454,THE GHOSTS,"In the wigwam, dimly lighted"
15455,THE GHOSTS,"By the brands that still were burning,"
15456,THE GHOSTS,"By the glimmering, flickering firelight"
15457,THE GHOSTS,"Heard a sighing, oft repeated,"
15458,THE GHOSTS,"Heard a sobbing, as of sorrow."
15459,THE GHOSTS,"From his couch rose Hiawatha,"
15460,THE GHOSTS,"From his shaggy hides of bison,"
15461,THE GHOSTS,"Pushed aside the deer-skin curtain,"
15462,THE GHOSTS,"Saw the pallid guests, the shadows,"
15463,THE GHOSTS,"Sitting upright on their couches,"
15464,THE GHOSTS,Weeping in the silent midnight.
15465,THE GHOSTS,"And he said: ""O guests! why is it"
15466,THE GHOSTS,"That your hearts are so afflicted,"
15467,THE GHOSTS,That you sob so in the midnight?
15468,THE GHOSTS,"Has perchance the old Nokomis,"
15469,THE GHOSTS,"Has my wife, my Minnehaha,"
15470,THE GHOSTS,"Wronged or grieved you by unkindness,"
15471,THE GHOSTS,"Failed in hospitable duties?"""
15472,THE GHOSTS,"Then the shadows ceased from weeping,"
15473,THE GHOSTS,"Ceased from sobbing and lamenting,"
15474,THE GHOSTS,"And they said, with gentle voices:"
15475,THE GHOSTS,"""We are ghosts of the departed,"
15476,THE GHOSTS,Souls of those who once were with you.
15477,THE GHOSTS,From the realms of Chibiabos

15479,THE GHOSTS,Hither have we come to warn you.
15480,THE GHOSTS,"""Cries of grief and lamentation"

15483,THE GHOSTS,"Calling back their friends departed,"
15484,THE GHOSTS,Sadden us with useless sorrow.
15485,THE GHOSTS,Therefore have we come to try you;
15486,THE GHOSTS,"No one knows us, no one heeds us."
15487,THE GHOSTS,"We are but a burden to you,"
15488,THE GHOSTS,And we see that the departed
15489,THE GHOSTS,Have no place among the living.
15490,THE GHOSTS,"""Think of this, O Hiawatha!"

15493,THE GHOSTS,They no more with lamentations
15494,THE GHOSTS,Sadden the souls of the departed
15495,THE GHOSTS,In the Islands of the Blessed.
15496,THE GHOSTS,"""Do not lay such heavy burdens"
15497,THE GHOSTS,"In the graves of those you bury,"
15498,THE GHOSTS,"Not such weight of furs and wampum,"
15499,THE GHOSTS,"Not such weight of pots and kettles,"
15500,THE GHOSTS,For the spirits faint beneath them.
15501,THE GHOSTS,"Only give them food to carry,"
15502,THE GHOSTS,Only give them fire to light them.
15503,THE GHOSTS,"""Four days is the spirit's journey"
15504,THE GHOSTS,"To the land of ghosts and shadows,"
15505,THE GHOSTS,Four its lonely night encampments;
15506,THE GHOSTS,Four times must their fires be lighted.
15507,THE GHOSTS,"Therefore, when the dead are buried,"
15508,THE GHOSTS,"Let a fire, as night approaches,"
15509,THE GHOSTS,"Four times on the grave be kindled,"
15510,THE GHOSTS,That the soul upon its journey
15511,THE GHOSTS,"May not lack the cheerful firelight,"
15512,THE GHOSTS,May not grope about in darkness.
15513,THE GHOSTS,"""Farewell, noble Hiawatha!"
15514,THE GHOSTS,"We have put you to the trial,"
15515,THE GHOSTS,"To the proof have put your patience,"
15516,THE GHOSTS,"By the insult of our presence,"
15517,THE GHOSTS,By the outrage of our actions.
15518,THE GHOSTS,We have found you great and noble.
15519,THE GHOSTS,"Fail not in the greater trial,"
15520,THE GHOSTS,"Faint not in the harder struggle."""
15521,THE GHOSTS,"When they ceased, a sudden darkness"

15569,THE FAMINE,"Came two other guests, as silent"
15570,THE FAMINE,"As the ghosts were, and as gloomy,"
15571,THE FAMINE,Waited not to be invited
15572,THE FAMINE,Did not parley at the doorway
15573,THE FAMINE,Sat there without word of welcome
15574,THE FAMINE,In the seat of Laughing Water;
15575,THE FAMINE,Looked with haggard eyes and hollow
15576,THE FAMINE,At the face of Laughing Water.
15577,THE FAMINE,"And the foremost said: ""Behold me!"
15578,THE FAMINE,"I am Famine, Bukadawin!"""
15579,THE FAMINE,"And the other said: ""Behold me!"
15580,THE FAMINE,"I am Fever, Ahkosewin!"""
15581,THE FAMINE,And the lovely Minnehaha
15582,THE FAMINE,"Shuddered as they looked upon her,"
15583,THE FAMINE,"Shuddered at the words they uttered,"
15584,THE FAMINE,"Lay down on her bed in silence,"
15585,THE FAMINE,"Hid her face, but made no answer;"
15586,THE FAMINE,"Lay there trembling, freezing, burning"
15587,THE FAMINE,"At the looks they cast upon her,"
15588,THE FAMINE,At the fearful words they uttered.
15589,THE FAMINE,Forth into the empty forest
15590,THE FAMINE,Rushed the maddened Hiawatha;
15591,THE FAMINE,"In his heart was deadly sorrow,"
15592,THE FAMINE,In his face a stony firmness;
15593,THE FAMINE,On his brow the sweat of anguish
15594,THE FAMINE,"Started, but it froze and fell not."
15595,THE FAMINE,"Wrapped in furs and armed for hunting,"
15596,THE FAMINE,"With his mighty bow of ash-tree,"
15597,THE FAMINE,"With his quiver full of arrows,"
15598,THE FAMINE,"With his mittens, Minjekahwun,"
15599,THE FAMINE,Into the vast and vacant forest
15600,THE FAMINE,On his snow-shoes strode he forward.
15601,THE FAMINE,"""Gitche Manito, the Mighty!"""
15602,THE FAMINE,Cried he with his face uplifted
15603,THE FAMINE,"In that bitter hour of anguish,"
15604,THE FAMINE,"""Give your children food, O father!"
15605,THE FAMINE,"Give us food, or we must perish!"
15606,THE FAMINE,"Give me food for Minnehaha,"
15607,THE FAMINE,"For my dying Minnehaha!"""
15608,THE FAMINE,"Through the far-resounding forest,"
15609,THE FAMINE,Through the forest vast and vacant
15610,THE FAMINE,"Rang that cry of desolation,"
15611,THE FAMINE,But there came no other answer
15612,THE FAMINE,"Than the echo of his crying,"
15613,THE FAMINE,"Than the echo of the woodlands,"
15614,THE FAMINE,"""Minnehaha! Minnehaha!"""
15615,THE FAMINE,All day long roved Hiawatha
15616,THE FAMINE,"In that melancholy forest,"
15617,THE FAMINE,"Through the shadow of whose thickets,"
15618,THE FAMINE,"In the pleasant days of Summer,"
15619,THE FAMINE,"Of that ne'er forgotten Summer,"
15620,THE FAMINE,He had brought his young wife homeward
15621,THE FAMINE,From the land of the Dacotahs;
15622,THE FAMINE,"When the birds sang in the thickets,"
15623,THE FAMINE,"And the streamlets laughed and glistened,"
15624,THE FAMINE,"And the air was full of fragrance,"
15625,THE FAMINE,And the lovely Laughing Water
15626,THE FAMINE,"Said with voice that did not tremble,"
15627,THE FAMINE,"""I will follow you, my husband!"""
15628,THE FAMINE,"In the wigwam with Nokomis,"
15629,THE FAMINE,"With those gloomy guests that watched her,"
15630,THE FAMINE,"With the Famine and the Fever,"
15631,THE FAMINE,"She was lying, the Beloved,"
15632,THE FAMINE,"She, the dying Minnehaha."
15633,THE FAMINE,"""Hark!"" she said; ""I hear a rushing,"
15634,THE FAMINE,"Hear a roaring and a rushing,"
15635,THE FAMINE,Hear the Falls of Minnehaha
15636,THE FAMINE,"Calling to me from a distance!"""
15637,THE FAMINE,"""No, my child!"" said old Nokomis,"
15638,THE FAMINE,"""'T is the night-wind in the pine-trees!"""
15639,THE FAMINE,"""Look!"" she said; ""I see my father"
15640,THE FAMINE,"Standing lonely at his doorway,"
15641,THE FAMINE,Beckoning to me from his wigwam
15642,THE FAMINE,"In the land of the Dacotahs!"""
15643,THE FAMINE,"""No, my child!"" said old Nokomis."
15644,THE FAMINE,"""'T is the smoke, that waves and beckons!"""
15645,THE FAMINE,"""Ah!"" said she, ""the eyes of Pauguk"
15646,THE FAMINE,"Glare upon me in the darkness,"
15647,THE FAMINE,I can feel his icy fingers
15648,THE FAMINE,Clasping mine amid the darkness!
15649,THE FAMINE,"Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"""
15650,THE FAMINE,"And the desolate Hiawatha,"
15651,THE FAMINE,"Far away amid the forest,"
15652,THE FAMINE,"Miles away among the mountains,"
15653,THE FAMINE,"Heard that sudden cry of anguish,"
15654,THE FAMINE,Heard the voice of Minnehaha
15655,THE FAMINE,"Calling to him in the darkness,"
15656,THE FAMINE,"""Hiawatha! Hiawatha!"""
15657,THE FAMINE,"Over snow-fields waste and pathless,"
15658,THE FAMINE,"Under snow-encumbered branches,"
15659,THE FAMINE,"Homeward hurried Hiawatha,"
15660,THE FAMINE,"Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,"
15661,THE FAMINE,"Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing:"
15662,THE FAMINE,"""Wahonowin! Wahonowin!"
15663,THE FAMINE,"Would that I had perished for you,"
15664,THE FAMINE,Would that I were dead as you are!
15665,THE FAMINE,"Wahonowin! Wahonowin!"""
15666,THE FAMINE,"And he rushed into the wigwam,"
15667,THE FAMINE,Saw the old Nokomis slowly
15668,THE FAMINE,"Rocking to and fro and moaning,"
15669,THE FAMINE,Saw his lovely Minnehaha
15670,THE FAMINE,"Lying dead and cold before him,"
15671,THE FAMINE,And his bursting heart within him
15672,THE FAMINE,"Uttered such a cry of anguish,"
15673,THE FAMINE,"That the forest moaned and shuddered,"
15674,THE FAMINE,That the very stars in heaven
15675,THE FAMINE,Shook and trembled with his anguish.
15676,THE FAMINE,"Then he sat down, still and speechless,"
15677,THE FAMINE,"On the bed of Minnehaha,"
15678,THE FAMINE,"At the feet of Laughing Water,"
15679,THE FAMINE,"At those willing feet, that never"
15680,THE FAMINE,"More would lightly run to meet him,"
15681,THE FAMINE,Never more would lightly follow.
15682,THE FAMINE,"With both hands his face he covered,"
15683,THE FAMINE,"Seven long days and nights he sat there,"
15684,THE FAMINE,"As if in a swoon he sat there,"
15685,THE FAMINE,"Speechless, motionless, unconscious"
15686,THE FAMINE,Of the daylight or the darkness.
15687,THE FAMINE,Then they buried Minnehaha;
15688,THE FAMINE,In the snow a grave they made her
15689,THE FAMINE,In the forest deep and darksome
15690,THE FAMINE,Underneath the moaning hemlocks;
15691,THE FAMINE,Clothed her in her richest garments
15692,THE FAMINE,"Wrapped her in her robes of ermine,"
15693,THE FAMINE,"Covered her with snow, like ermine;"
15694,THE FAMINE,Thus they buried Minnehaha.
15695,THE FAMINE,"And at night a fire was lighted,"
15696,THE FAMINE,"On her grave four times was kindled,"
15697,THE FAMINE,For her soul upon its journey
15698,THE FAMINE,To the Islands of the Blessed.
15699,THE FAMINE,From his doorway Hiawatha
15700,THE FAMINE,"Saw it burning in the forest,"
15701,THE FAMINE,Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks;
15702,THE FAMINE,"From his sleepless bed uprising,"
15703,THE FAMINE,"From the bed of Minnehaha,"
15704,THE FAMINE,"Stood and watched it at the doorway,"
15705,THE FAMINE,"That it might not be extinguished,"
15706,THE FAMINE,Might not leave her in the darkness.
15707,THE FAMINE,"""Farewell!"" said he, ""Minnehaha!"
15708,THE FAMINE,"Farewell, O my Laughing Water!"
15709,THE FAMINE,"All my heart is buried with you,"
15710,THE FAMINE,All my thoughts go onward with you!
15711,THE FAMINE,"Come not back again to labor,"
15712,THE FAMINE,"Come not back again to suffer,"
15713,THE FAMINE,Where the Famine and the Fever
15714,THE FAMINE,Wear the heart and waste the body.
15715,THE FAMINE,"Soon my task will be completed,"
15716,THE FAMINE,Soon your footsteps I shall follow
15717,THE FAMINE,"To the Islands of the Blessed,"
15718,THE FAMINE,"To the Kingdom of Ponemah,"
15719,THE FAMINE,"To the Land of the Hereafter!"""

15726,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,
15727,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"In his lodge beside a river,"
15728,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Close beside a frozen river,"
15729,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sat an old man, sad and lonely."
15730,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,White his hair was as a snow-drift;
15731,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Dull and low his fire was burning,"
15732,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the old man shook and trembled,"
15733,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Folded in his Waubewyon,"
15734,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"In his tattered white-skin-wrapper,"
15735,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Hearing nothing but the tempest
15736,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"As it roared along the forest,"
15737,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Seeing nothing but the snow-storm,"
15738,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,As it whirled and hissed and drifted.
15739,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"All the coals were white with ashes,"
15740,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the fire was slowly dying,"
15741,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"As a young man, walking lightly,"
15742,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,At the open doorway entered.
15743,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Red with blood of youth his cheeks were,"
15744,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Soft his eyes, as stars in Spring-time,"
15745,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Bound his forehead was with grasses;
15746,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Bound and plumed with scented grasses,"
15747,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"On his lips a smile of beauty,"
15748,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Filling all the lodge with sunshine,"
15749,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,In his hand a bunch of blossoms
15750,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Filling all the lodge with sweetness.
15751,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Ah, my son!"" exclaimed the old man,"
15752,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Happy are my eyes to see you."
15753,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sit here on the mat beside me,"
15754,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sit here by the dying embers,"
15755,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Let us pass the night together,"
15756,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Tell me of your strange adventures,"
15757,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Of the lands where you have travelled;
15758,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"I will tell you of my prowess,"
15759,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Of my many deeds of wonder."""
15760,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From his pouch he drew his peace-pipe,"
15761,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Very old and strangely fashioned;
15762,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Made of red stone was the pipe-head,"
15763,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And the stem a reed with feathers;
15764,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Filled the pipe with bark of willow,"
15765,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Placed a burning coal upon it,"
15766,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Gave it to his guest, the stranger,"
15767,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And began to speak in this wise:
15768,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""When I blow my breath about me,"
15769,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"When I breathe upon the landscape,"
15770,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Motionless are all the rivers,"

15772,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the young man answered, smiling:"

15777,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""When I shake my hoary tresses,"""

15786,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"For I speak, and lo! they are not."
15787,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And where'er my footsteps wander,"
15788,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,All the wild beasts of the forest
15789,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Hide themselves in holes and caverns,"
15790,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the earth becomes as flintstone!"""
15791,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""When I shake my flowing ringlets,"""

15797,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Homeward shoots the arrowy swallow,"
15798,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sing the bluebird and the robin,"
15799,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And where'er my footsteps wander,"
15800,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"All the meadows wave with blossoms,"

15803,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"While they spake, the night departed:"
15804,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From the distant realms of Wabun,"

15806,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Like a warrior robed and painted,"
15807,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came the sun, and said, ""Behold me"
15808,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Gheezis, the great sun, behold me!"""
15809,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Then the old man's tongue was speechless
15810,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the air grew warm and pleasant,"
15811,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And upon the wigwam sweetly
15812,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sang the bluebird and the robin,"
15813,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the stream began to murmur,"
15814,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And a scent of growing grasses
15815,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Through the lodge was gently wafted.
15816,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And Segwun, the youthful stranger,"
15817,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,More distinctly in the daylight
15818,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Saw the icy face before him;
15819,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"It was Peboan, the Winter!"
15820,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From his eyes the tears were flowing,"
15821,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"As from melting lakes the streamlets,"
15822,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And his body shrunk and dwindled
15823,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"As the shouting sun ascended,"
15824,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Till into the air it faded,"
15825,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Till into the ground it vanished,"
15826,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the young man saw before him,"
15827,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"On the hearth-stone of the wigwam,"
15828,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Where the fire had smoked and smouldered,"
15829,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Saw the earliest flower of Spring-time,"
15830,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Saw the Beauty of the Spring-time,"
15831,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Saw the Miskodeed in blossom.
15832,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Thus it was that in the North-land
15833,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"After that unheard-of coldness,"
15834,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"That intolerable Winter,"
15835,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came the Spring with all its splendor,"
15836,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"All its birds and all its blossoms,"
15837,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,All its flowers and leaves and grasses.
15838,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sailing on the wind to northward,"
15839,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Flying in great flocks, like arrows,"
15840,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Like huge arrows shot through heaven,"
15841,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Passed the swan, the Mahnahbezee,"
15842,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Speaking almost as a man speaks;
15843,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And in long lines waving, bending"
15844,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Like a bow-string snapped asunder,"
15845,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came the white goose, Waw-be-wawa;"
15846,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And in pairs, or singly flying,"
15847,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Mahng the loon, with clangorous pinions,"
15848,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"The blue heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
15849,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the grouse, the Mushkodasa."
15850,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,In the thickets and the meadows
15851,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Piped the bluebird, the Owaissa,"
15852,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,On the summit of the lodges
15853,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Sang the robin, the Opechee,"
15854,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,In the covert of the pine-trees
15855,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Cooed the pigeon, the Omemee;"
15856,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"And the sorrowing Hiawatha,"
15857,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Speechless in his infinite sorrow,"
15858,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Heard their voices calling to him,"
15859,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Went forth from his gloomy doorway,"
15860,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Stood and gazed into the heaven,"
15861,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Gazed upon the earth and waters.
15862,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From his wanderings far to eastward,"
15863,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From the regions of the morning,"
15864,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From the shining land of Wabun,"
15865,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Homeward now returned Iagoo,"
15866,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"The great traveller, the great boaster,"
15867,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Full of new and strange adventures,"
15868,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Marvels many and many wonders.
15869,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And the people of the village
15870,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Listened to him as he told them
15871,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Of his marvellous adventures,"
15872,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Laughing answered him in this wise:
15873,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Ugh! it is indeed Iagoo!"
15874,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"No one else beholds such wonders!"""
15875,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"He had seen, he said, a water"
15876,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Bigger than the Big-Sea-Water,"
15877,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Broader than the Gitche Gumee,"
15878,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Bitter so that none could drink it!
15879,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"At each other looked the warriors,"
15880,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Looked the women at each other,"
15881,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Smiled, and said, ""It cannot be so!"""
15882,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Kaw!"" they said, it cannot be so!"""
15883,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"O'er it, said he, o'er this water"
15884,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came a great canoe with pinions,"
15885,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"A canoe with wings came flying,"
15886,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Bigger than a grove of pine-trees,"
15887,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Taller than the tallest tree-tops!
15888,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And the old men and the women
15889,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Looked and tittered at each other;
15890,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Kaw!"" they said, ""we don't believe it!"""
15891,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From its mouth, he said, to greet him,"
15892,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came Waywassimo, the lightning,"
15893,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came the thunder, Annemeekee!"
15894,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And the warriors and the women
15895,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Laughed aloud at poor Iagoo;
15896,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Kaw!"" they said, ""what tales you tell us!"""
15897,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"In it, said he, came a people,"
15898,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,In the great canoe with pinions
15899,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Came, he said, a hundred warriors;"
15900,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Painted white were all their faces
15901,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And with hair their chins were covered!
15902,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And the warriors and the women
15903,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Laughed and shouted in derision,"
15904,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Like the ravens on the tree-tops,"
15905,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Like the crows upon the hemlocks.
15906,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Kaw!"" they said, ""what lies you tell us!"
15907,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Do not think that we believe them!"""
15908,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Only Hiawatha laughed not,"
15909,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,But he gravely spake and answered
15910,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,To their jeering and their jesting:
15911,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""True is all Iagoo tells us;"
15912,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"I have seen it in a vision,"
15913,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Seen the great canoe with pinions,"

15917,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"From the regions of the morning,"
15918,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,From the shining land of Wabun.
15919,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Gitche Manito, the Mighty,"

15931,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,And the heart's right hand of friendship

15934,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Said this to me in my vision.
15935,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""I beheld, too, in that vision"

15944,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"In the woodlands rang their axes,"
15945,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Smoked their towns in all the valleys,"
15946,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Over all the lakes and rivers
15947,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Rushed their great canoes of thunder.
15948,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"""Then a darker, drearier vision"
15949,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Passed before me, vague and cloud-like;"

15951,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"All forgetful of my counsels,"
15952,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,"Weakened, warring with each other;"
15953,THE WHITE MAN'S FOOT,Saw the remnants of our people

15965,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"By the shining Big-Sea-Water,"
15966,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"At the doorway of his wigwam,"
15967,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"In the pleasant Summer morning,"
15968,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Hiawatha stood and waited.
15969,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"All the air was full of freshness,"
15970,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"All the earth was bright and joyous,"
15971,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And before him, through the sunshine,"
15972,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Westward toward the neighboring forest
15973,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Passed in golden swarms the Ahmo,"
15974,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Passed the bees, the honey-makers,"
15975,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Burning, singing in the sunshine."
15976,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Bright above him shone the heavens,"

15978,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"From its bosom leaped the sturgeon,"
15979,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sparkling, flashing in the sunshine;"
15980,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,On its margin the great forest
15981,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Stood reflected in the water,"
15982,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Every tree-top had its shadow,"
15983,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Motionless beneath the water.
15984,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,From the brow of Hiawatha
15985,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Gone was every trace of sorrow,"
15986,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"As the fog from off the water,"
15987,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,As the mist from off the meadow.
15988,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"With a smile of joy and triumph,"
15989,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"With a look of exultation,"
15990,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,As of one who in a vision
15991,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sees what is to be, but is not,"
15992,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Stood and waited Hiawatha.
15993,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Toward the sun his hands were lifted,"
15994,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Both the palms spread out against it,"
15995,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And between the parted fingers
15996,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Fell the sunshine on his features,"
15997,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Flecked with light his naked shoulders,"
15998,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,As it falls and flecks an oak-tree
15999,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Through the rifted leaves and branches.
16000,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"O'er the water floating, flying,"
16001,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Something in the hazy distance,"

16004,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Now seemed floating, now seemed flying,"
16005,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Coming nearer, nearer, nearer."
16006,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Was it Shingebis the diver?

16008,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Or the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah?"
16009,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Or the white goose, Waw-be-wawa,"
16010,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"With the water dripping, flashing,"
16011,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,From its glossy neck and feathers?
16012,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"It was neither goose nor diver,"

16018,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Dripping, flashing in the sunshine;"
16019,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And within it came a people
16020,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"From the distant land of Wabun,"
16021,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,From the farthest realms of morning
16022,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Came the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,"
16023,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"He the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face,"
16024,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,With his guides and his companions.
16025,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the noble Hiawatha,"
16026,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"With his hands aloft extended,"
16027,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Held aloft in sign of welcome,"
16028,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Waited, full of exultation,"
16029,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Till the birch canoe with paddles
16030,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Grated on the shining pebbles,"
16031,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Stranded on the sandy margin,"
16032,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,"
16033,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"With the cross upon his bosom,"
16034,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Landed on the sandy margin.
16035,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Then the joyous Hiawatha
16036,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Cried aloud and spake in this wise:
16037,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""Beautiful is the sun, O strangers,"
16038,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,When you come so far to see us!
16039,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"All our town in peace awaits you,"
16040,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,All our doors stand open for you;
16041,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"You shall enter all our wigwams,"
16042,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,For the heart's right hand we give you.
16043,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""Never bloomed the earth so gayly,"
16044,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Never shone the sun so brightly,"
16045,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,As to-day they shine and blossom
16046,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,When you come so far to see us!
16047,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Never was our lake so tranquil,"
16048,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Nor so free from rocks, and sand-bars;"
16049,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,For your birch canoe in passing
16050,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Has removed both rock and sand-bar.
16051,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""Never before had our tobacco"
16052,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Such a sweet and pleasant flavor,"
16053,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Never the broad leaves of our cornfields
16054,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Were so beautiful to look on,"
16055,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"As they seem to us this morning,"
16056,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,When you come so far to see us!'
16057,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the Black-Robe chief made answer,"
16058,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Stammered in his speech a little,"
16059,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Speaking words yet unfamiliar:
16060,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""Peace be with you, Hiawatha,"
16061,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Peace be with you and your people,"
16062,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Peace of prayer, and peace of pardon,"
16063,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Peace of Christ, and joy of Mary!"""
16064,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Then the generous Hiawatha
16065,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Led the strangers to his wigwam,"
16066,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Seated them on skins of bison,"
16067,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Seated them on skins of ermine,"
16068,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And the careful old Nokomis
16069,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Brought them food in bowls of basswood,"
16070,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Water brought in birchen dippers,"
16071,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the calumet, the peace-pipe,"
16072,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Filled and lighted for their smoking.
16073,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"All the old men of the village,"
16074,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"All the warriors of the nation,"
16075,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"All the Jossakeeds, the Prophets,"
16076,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"The magicians, the Wabenos,"
16077,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the Medicine-men, the Medas,"
16078,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Came to bid the strangers welcome;
16079,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""It is well"", they said, ""O brothers,"
16080,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"That you come so far to see us!"""
16081,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"In a circle round the doorway,"
16082,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"With their pipes they sat in silence,"
16083,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Waiting to behold the strangers,"
16084,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Waiting to receive their message;
16085,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Till the Black-Robe chief, the Pale-face,"
16086,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"From the wigwam came to greet them,"
16087,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Stammering in his speech a little,"
16088,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Speaking words yet unfamiliar;
16089,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""It is well,"" they said, ""O brother,"
16090,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"That you come so far to see us!"""
16091,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Then the Black-Robe chief, the Prophet,"
16092,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Told his message to the people,"
16093,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Told the purport of his mission,"
16094,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Told them of the Virgin Mary,"
16095,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And her blessed Son, the Saviour,"
16096,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,How in distant lands and ages
16097,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,He had lived on earth as we do;
16098,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"How he fasted, prayed, and labored;"
16099,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"How the Jews, the tribe accursed,"
16100,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Mocked him, scourged him, crucified him;"
16101,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"How he rose from where they laid him,"
16102,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Walked again with his disciples,"
16103,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And ascended into heaven.
16104,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the chiefs made answer, saying:"
16105,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""We have listened to your message,"
16106,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"We have heard your words of wisdom,"
16107,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,We will think on what you tell us.
16108,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"It is well for us, O brothers,"
16109,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"That you come so far to see us!"""
16110,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Then they rose up and departed
16111,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Each one homeward to his wigwam,"
16112,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,To the young men and the women
16113,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Told the story of the strangers
16114,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Whom the Master of Life had sent them
16115,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,From the shining land of Wabun.
16116,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Heavy with the heat and silence
16117,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Grew the afternoon of Summer;
16118,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,With a drowsy sound the forest
16119,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Whispered round the sultry wigwam,"
16120,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,With a sound of sleep the water
16121,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Rippled on the beach below it;
16122,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,From the cornfields shrill and ceaseless
16123,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sang the grasshopper, Pah-puk-keena;"
16124,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the guests of Hiawatha,"
16125,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Weary with the heat of Summer,"
16126,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Slumbered in the sultry wigwam.
16127,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Slowly o'er the simmering landscape
16128,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Fell the evening's dusk and coolness,"
16129,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And the long and level sunbeams
16130,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Shot their spears into the forest,"
16131,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Breaking through its shields of shadow,"
16132,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Rushed into each secret ambush,"
16133,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Searched each thicket, dingle, hollow;"
16134,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Still the guests of Hiawatha
16135,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Slumbered in the silent wigwam.
16136,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"From his place rose Hiawatha,"
16137,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Bade farewell to old Nokomis,"
16138,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,"
16139,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Did not wake the guests, that slumbered."

16141,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"On a long and distant journey,"
16142,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,To the portals of the Sunset.

16149,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Never danger nor suspicion,"
16150,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Never want of food or shelter,"
16151,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"In the lodge of Hiawatha!"""
16152,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Forth into the village went he,"
16153,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Bade farewell to all the warriors,"
16154,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Bade farewell to all the young men,"
16155,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Spake persuading, spake in this wise:"
16156,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"""I am going, O my people,"
16157,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,On a long and distant journey;
16158,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Many moons and many winters
16159,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Will have come, and will have vanished,"
16160,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Ere I come again to see you.
16161,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,But my guests I leave behind me;
16162,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Listen to their words of wisdom,"
16163,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Listen to the truth they tell you,"
16164,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,For the Master of Life has sent them
16165,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"From the land of light and morning!"""
16166,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"On the shore stood Hiawatha,"
16167,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Turned and waved his hand at parting;
16168,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,On the clear and luminous water
16169,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Launched his birch canoe for sailing,"
16170,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,From the pebbles of the margin
16171,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Shoved it forth into the water;
16172,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Whispered to it, ""Westward! westward!"""
16173,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And with speed it darted forward.
16174,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And the evening sun descending
16175,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Set the clouds on fire with redness,"
16176,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Burned the broad sky, like a prairie,"
16177,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Left upon the level water
16178,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"One long track and trail of splendor,"
16179,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Down whose stream, as down a river,"
16180,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Westward, westward Hiawatha"
16181,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sailed into the fiery sunset,"
16182,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sailed into the purple vapors,"
16183,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Sailed into the dusk of evening:
16184,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,And the people from the margin
16185,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Watched him floating, rising, sinking,"
16186,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Till the birch canoe seemed lifted
16187,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"High into that sea of splendor,"
16188,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Till it sank into the vapors
16189,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Like the new moon slowly, slowly"
16190,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,Sinking in the purple distance.
16191,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And they said, ""Farewell forever!"""
16192,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Said, ""Farewell, O Hiawatha!"""
16193,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the forests, dark and lonely,"
16194,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Moved through all their depths of darkness,"
16195,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sighed, ""Farewell, O Hiawatha!"""

16197,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Rising, rippling on the pebbles,"
16198,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"Sobbed, ""Farewell, O Hiawatha!"""
16199,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah,"
16200,HIAWATHA'S DEPARTURE,"From her haunts among the fen-lands,"

16603,VOCABULARY,wa-ge-min is the word shouted aloud.  It is the symbol of a thief in
16604,VOCABULARY,the cornfield.  It is considered as the image of an old man stooping
16605,VOCABULARY,as he enters the lot.  Had the chisel of Praxiteles been employed to
16606,VOCABULARY,"produce this image, it could not more vividly bring to the minds of"

16637,VOCABULARY,"desperate stakes I have seen no examples, nor do I think the game"

16640,VOCABULARY,"not noted as hunters or warriors, or steady providers for their"

16660,VOCABULARY,"District, Part II. p. 124.  From this I make the following extract:--"
16661,VOCABULARY,
16662,VOCABULARY,"""The Pictured Rocks may be described, in general terms, as a series"
16663,VOCABULARY,of sandstone bluffs extending along the shore of Lake Superior for
16664,VOCABULARY,"about five miles, and rising, in most places, vertically from the"
16665,VOCABULARY,"water, without any beach at the base, to a height varying from fifty"
16666,VOCABULARY,"to nearly two hundred feet.  Were they simply a line of cliffs, they"
16667,VOCABULARY,"might not, so far as relates to height or extent, be worthy of a"
16668,VOCABULARY,"rank among great natural curiosities, although such an assemblage of"
16669,VOCABULARY,"rocky strata, washed by the waves of the great lake, would not,"
16670,VOCABULARY,"under any circumstances, be destitute of grandeur.  To the voyager,"
16671,VOCABULARY,"coasting along their base in his frail canoe, they would, at all"
16672,VOCABULARY,"times, be an object of dread; the recoil of the surf, the rock-bound"
16673,VOCABULARY,"coast, affording, for miles, no place of refuge,--the lowering sky,"
16674,VOCABULARY,"the rising wind,--all these would excite his apprehension, and"
16675,VOCABULARY,induce him to ply a vigorous oar until the dreaded wall was passed.
16676,VOCABULARY,But in the Pictured Rocks there are two features which communicate
16677,VOCABULARY,"to the scenery a wonderful and almost unique character.  These are,"
16678,VOCABULARY,"first, the curious manner in which the cliffs have been excavated"
16679,VOCABULARY,"and worn away by the action of the lake, which, for centuries, has"
16680,VOCABULARY,"dashed an ocean-like surf against their base; and, second, the"
16681,VOCABULARY,equally curious manner in which large portions of the surface have
16682,VOCABULARY,been colored by bands of brilliant hues.
16683,VOCABULARY,
16684,VOCABULARY,"""It is from the latter circumstance that the name, by which these"
16685,VOCABULARY,"cliffs are known to the American traveller, is derived; while that"
16686,VOCABULARY,applied to them by the French voyageurs ('Les Portails') is derived
16687,VOCABULARY,"from the former, and by far the most striking peculiarity."
16688,VOCABULARY,
16689,VOCABULARY,"""The term Pictured Rocks has been in use for a great length of time;"
16690,VOCABULARY,"but when it was first applied, we have been unable to discover.  It"
16691,VOCABULARY,would seem that the first travellers were more impressed with the
16692,VOCABULARY,novel and striking distribution of colors on the surface than with
16693,VOCABULARY,the astonishing variety of form into which the cliffs themselves

16910,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,"""Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that prompts me;"
16911,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,"Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!"""
16912,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,"Then made answer John Alden: ""The name of friendship is sacred;"
16913,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,"What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!"""
16914,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,"So the strong will prevailed, subduing and moulding the gentler,"
16915,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP,"Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand."

16921,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,THE LOVER'S ERRAND
16922,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
16923,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,"
16924,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,"
16925,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Into the tranquil woods, where blue-birds and robins were building"
16926,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,"
16927,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Peaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom."
16928,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,"
16929,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse."
16930,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,"
16931,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"As in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,"
16932,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!"
16933,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""Must I relinquish it all,"" he cried with a wild lamentation,"
16934,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?"
16935,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshipped in silence?"
16936,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Was it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow
16937,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?"
16938,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption"
16939,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Rise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion;"
16940,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan."
16941,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!"
16942,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,"
16943,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"For I have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,"
16944,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Worshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal."
16945,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution."""
16946,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
16947,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;
16948,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and shallow,"
16949,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Gathering still, as he went, the May-flowers blooming around him,"
16950,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness,"
16951,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Children lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber."
16952,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""Puritan flowers,"" he said, ""and the type of Puritan maidens,"
16953,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!"
16954,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the May-flower of Plymouth,"
16955,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;"
16956,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,"
16957,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver."""
16958,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;
16959,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,"
16960,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Sailless, sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;"
16961,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Saw the new-built house and people at work in a meadow;
16962,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla"
16963,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,"
16964,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,"
16965,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many."
16966,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden"
16967,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift"
16968,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,"
16969,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.
16970,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth,"
16971,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together,"
16972,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a churchyard,"
16973,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.
16974,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,"
16975,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,"
16976,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Making the humble house and the modest apparel of home-spun
16977,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!"
16978,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,"
16979,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Thoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe of his errand;"
16980,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,"
16981,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,"
16982,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Haunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces."
16983,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Still he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,"
16984,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""Let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards;"
16985,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains,"
16986,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Though it pass o'er the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living,"
16987,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"It is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth for ever!"""
16988,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
16989,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,So he entered the house: and the hum of the wheel and the singing
16990,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,"
16991,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,"
16992,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Saying, ""I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;"
16993,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning."""
16994,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled"
16995,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,"
16996,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,"
16997,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Finding no words for his thought.  He remembered that day in the winter,"
16998,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,"
16999,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway,"
17000,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and Priscilla"
17001,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fireside,"
17002,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm.
17003,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Had he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken;
17004,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!
17005,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer."
17006,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
17007,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful Spring-time,"
17008,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Talked of their friends at home, and the Mayflower that sailed on the morrow."
17009,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""I have been thinking all day,"" said gently the Puritan maiden,"
17010,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows of England,--"
17011,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;"
17012,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,"
17013,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors"
17014,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,"
17015,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy"
17016,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Climbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard."
17017,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;"
17018,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England."
17019,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it: I almost"
17020,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched."""
17021,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
17022,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Thereupon answered the youth:--""Indeed I do not condemn you;"
17023,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Stouter hearts than a woman's have quailed in this terrible winter.
17024,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;"
17025,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage"
17026,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!"""
17027,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
17028,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters,--"
17029,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Did not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,"
17030,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a schoolboy;"
17031,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.
17032,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden"
17033,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Looked into Alden's face, her eyes dilated with wonder,"
17034,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;"
17035,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:"
17036,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,"
17037,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?"
17038,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!"""
17039,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,"
17040,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,--"
17041,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Had no time for such things;--such things! the words grating harshly
17042,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:
17043,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"""Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he is married,"
17044,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?"
17045,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"That is the way with you men; you don't understand us, you cannot."
17046,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"When you have made up your minds, after thinking of this one and that one,"
17047,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Choosing, selecting, rejecting, comparing one with another,"
17048,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Then you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden avowal,"
17049,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"And are offended and hurt, and indignant perhaps, that a woman"
17050,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected,"
17051,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing.
17052,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,This is not right nor just: for surely a woman's affection
17053,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Is not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking."
17054,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"When one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it."
17055,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Had he but waited awhile, had he only showed that he loved me,"
17056,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Even this Captain of yours--who knows?--at last might have won me,"
17057,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Old and rough as he is; but now it never can happen."""
17058,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
17059,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,"
17060,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding;"
17061,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Spoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders,"
17062,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,"
17063,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth;"
17064,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly"
17065,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,"
17066,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Who was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;"
17067,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,"
17068,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent"
17069,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Combed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon."
17070,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"He was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature;"
17071,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the winter"
17072,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman's;"
17073,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,"
17074,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always,"
17075,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature;"
17076,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;"
17077,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Any woman in Plymouth, nay, any woman in England,"
17078,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish!
17079,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,
17080,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,"
17081,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,"
17082,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Archly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes over-running with laughter,"
17083,THE LOVER'S ERRAND,"Said, in a tremulous voice, ""Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"""

17089,JOHN ALDEN,JOHN ALDEN
17090,JOHN ALDEN,
17091,JOHN ALDEN,"Into the open air John Alden, perplexed and bewildered,"
17092,JOHN ALDEN,"Rushed like a man insane, and wandered alone by the sea-side;"
17093,JOHN ALDEN,"Paced up and down the sands, and bared his head to the east-wind,"
17094,JOHN ALDEN,"Cooling his heated brow, and the fire and fever within him."
17095,JOHN ALDEN,"Slowly as out of the heavens, with apocalyptical splendors,"
17096,JOHN ALDEN,"Sank the City of God, in the vision of John the Apostle,"
17097,JOHN ALDEN,"So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper, and sapphire,"
17098,JOHN ALDEN,"Sank the broad red sun, and over its turrets uplifted"
17099,JOHN ALDEN,Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city.
17100,JOHN ALDEN,
17101,JOHN ALDEN,"""Welcome, O wind of the East!"" he exclaimed in his wild exultation,"
17102,JOHN ALDEN,"""Welcome, O wind of the East, from the caves of the misty Atlantic!"
17103,JOHN ALDEN,"Blowing o'er fields of dulse, and measureless meadows of sea-grass,"
17104,JOHN ALDEN,"Blowing o'er rocky wastes, and the grottos and gardens of ocean!"
17105,JOHN ALDEN,"Lay thy cold, moist hand on my burning forehead, and wrap me"
17106,JOHN ALDEN,"Close in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!"""
17107,JOHN ALDEN,
17108,JOHN ALDEN,"Like an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing,"
17109,JOHN ALDEN,Beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea-shore.
17110,JOHN ALDEN,Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending;
17111,JOHN ALDEN,"Love triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and bleeding,"
17112,JOHN ALDEN,"Passionate cries of desire, and importunate pleadings of duty!"
17113,JOHN ALDEN,"""Is it my fault,"" he said, ""that the maiden has chosen between us?"
17114,JOHN ALDEN,"Is it my fault that he failed,--my fault that I am the victor?"""
17115,JOHN ALDEN,"Then within him there thundered a voice, like the voice of the Prophet:"
17116,JOHN ALDEN,"""It hath displeased the Lord!""--and he thought of David's transgression,"
17117,JOHN ALDEN,"Bathsheba's beautiful face, and his friend in the front of the battle!"
17118,JOHN ALDEN,"Shame and confusion of guilt, and abasement and self-condemnation,"
17119,JOHN ALDEN,Overwhelmed him at once; and he cried in the deepest contrition:
17120,JOHN ALDEN,"""It hath displeased the Lord!  It is the temptation of Satan!"""
17121,JOHN ALDEN,
17122,JOHN ALDEN,"Then, uplifting his head, he looked at the sea, and beheld there"
17123,JOHN ALDEN,"Dimly the shadowy form of the Mayflower riding at anchor,"
17124,JOHN ALDEN,"Rocked on the rising tide, and ready to sail on the morrow;"
17125,JOHN ALDEN,"Heard the voices of men through the mist, the rattle of cordage"
17126,JOHN ALDEN,"Thrown on the deck, the shouts of the mate, and the sailors' ""Ay, ay, Sir!"""
17127,JOHN ALDEN,"Clear and distinct, but not loud, in the dripping air of the twilight."
17128,JOHN ALDEN,"Still for a moment he stood, and listened, and stared at the vessel,"
17129,JOHN ALDEN,"Then went hurriedly on, as one who, seeing a phantom,"
17130,JOHN ALDEN,"Stops, then quickens his pace, and follows the beckoning shadow."
17131,JOHN ALDEN,"""Yes, it is plain to me now,"" he murmured; ""the hand of the Lord is"
17132,JOHN ALDEN,"Leading me out of the land of darkness, the bondage of error,"
17133,JOHN ALDEN,"Through the sea, that shall lift the walls of its waters around me,"
17134,JOHN ALDEN,"Hiding me, cutting me off, from the cruel thoughts that pursue me."
17135,JOHN ALDEN,"Back will I go o'er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,"
17136,JOHN ALDEN,"Her whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended."
17137,JOHN ALDEN,"Better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England,"
17138,JOHN ALDEN,"Close by my mother's side, and among the dust of my kindred;"
17139,JOHN ALDEN,"Better be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonor!"
17140,JOHN ALDEN,"Sacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber"
17141,JOHN ALDEN,"With me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers"
17142,JOHN ALDEN,"Bright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence and darkness,--"
17143,JOHN ALDEN,"Yes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter!"""
17144,JOHN ALDEN,
17145,JOHN ALDEN,"Thus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong resolution,"
17146,JOHN ALDEN,"Leaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight,"
17147,JOHN ALDEN,"Through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre,"
17148,JOHN ALDEN,"Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth,"
17149,JOHN ALDEN,Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening.
17150,JOHN ALDEN,"Soon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain"
17151,JOHN ALDEN,"Sitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Caesar,"
17152,JOHN ALDEN,Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders.
17153,JOHN ALDEN,"""Long have you been on your errand,"" he said with a cheery demeanor,"
17154,JOHN ALDEN,"Even as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue."
17155,JOHN ALDEN,"""Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us;"
17156,JOHN ALDEN,"But you have lingered so long, that while you were going and coming"
17157,JOHN ALDEN,I have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city.
17158,JOHN ALDEN,"Come, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened."""
17159,JOHN ALDEN,
17160,JOHN ALDEN,"Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure,"
17161,JOHN ALDEN,"From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;"
17162,JOHN ALDEN,"How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,"
17163,JOHN ALDEN,"Only smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal."
17164,JOHN ALDEN,"But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,"
17165,JOHN ALDEN,"Words so tender and cruel: ""Why don't you speak for yourself, John?"""
17166,JOHN ALDEN,"Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, till his armor"
17167,JOHN ALDEN,"Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a sound of sinister omen."
17168,JOHN ALDEN,"All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,"
17169,JOHN ALDEN,"Even as a hand-grenade, that scatters destruction around it."
17170,JOHN ALDEN,"Wildly he shouted, and loud: ""John Alden! you have betrayed me!"
17171,JOHN ALDEN,"Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded, betrayed me!"
17172,JOHN ALDEN,One of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of Wat Tyler;
17173,JOHN ALDEN,Who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor?
17174,JOHN ALDEN,"Yours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!"
17175,JOHN ALDEN,"You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;"
17176,JOHN ALDEN,"You, who have fed at my board, and drunk at my cup, to whose keeping"
17177,JOHN ALDEN,"I have intrusted my honor, my thoughts the most sacred and secret,--"
17178,JOHN ALDEN,"You too, Brutus! ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter!"
17179,JOHN ALDEN,"Brutus was Caesar's friend, and you were mine, but henceforward"
17180,JOHN ALDEN,"Let there be nothing between us save war, and implacable hatred!"""
17181,JOHN ALDEN,
17182,JOHN ALDEN,"So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,"
17183,JOHN ALDEN,Chafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins on his temples.
17184,JOHN ALDEN,"But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,"
17185,JOHN ALDEN,"Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,"
17186,JOHN ALDEN,Rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of Indians!
17187,JOHN ALDEN,"Straightway the Captain paused, and, without further question or parley,"
17188,JOHN ALDEN,"Took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,"
17189,JOHN ALDEN,"Buckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed."
17190,JOHN ALDEN,Alden was left alone.  He heard the clank of the scabbard
17191,JOHN ALDEN,"Growing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance."
17192,JOHN ALDEN,"Then he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,"
17193,JOHN ALDEN,"Felt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,"
17194,JOHN ALDEN,"Lifted his eyes to the heavens, and, folding his hands as in childhood,"
17195,JOHN ALDEN,Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.
17196,JOHN ALDEN,
17197,JOHN ALDEN,"Meanwhile the choleric Captain strode wrathful away to the council,"
17198,JOHN ALDEN,"Found it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming;"
17199,JOHN ALDEN,"Men in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment,"
17200,JOHN ALDEN,"Only one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven,"
17201,JOHN ALDEN,"Covered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of Plymouth."
17202,JOHN ALDEN,"God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,"
17203,JOHN ALDEN,"Then had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation;"
17204,JOHN ALDEN,"So say the chronicles old, and such is the faith of the people!"
17205,JOHN ALDEN,"Near them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant,"
17206,JOHN ALDEN,"Naked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect;"
17207,JOHN ALDEN,"While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible,"
17208,JOHN ALDEN,"Ponderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland,"
17209,JOHN ALDEN,"And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattle-snake glittered,"
17210,JOHN ALDEN,"Filled, like a quiver, with arrows; a signal and challenge of warfare,"
17211,JOHN ALDEN,"Brought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance."
17212,JOHN ALDEN,"This Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them debating"
17213,JOHN ALDEN,"What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,"
17214,JOHN ALDEN,"Talking of this and of that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;"
17215,JOHN ALDEN,"One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,"
17216,JOHN ALDEN,"Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted,"
17217,JOHN ALDEN,"Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!"
17218,JOHN ALDEN,"Then out spake Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,"
17219,JOHN ALDEN,"Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger,"
17220,JOHN ALDEN,"""What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?"
17221,JOHN ALDEN,Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted
17222,JOHN ALDEN,"There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?"
17223,JOHN ALDEN,Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage
17224,JOHN ALDEN,"Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon!"""
17225,JOHN ALDEN,"Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth,"
17226,JOHN ALDEN,Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language:
17227,JOHN ALDEN,"""Not so thought Saint Paul, nor yet the other Apostles;"
17228,JOHN ALDEN,"Not from the cannon's mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with!"""
17229,JOHN ALDEN,"But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,"
17230,JOHN ALDEN,"Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:"
17231,JOHN ALDEN,"""Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth."
17232,JOHN ALDEN,"War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,"
17233,JOHN ALDEN,"Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!"""
17234,JOHN ALDEN,
17235,JOHN ALDEN,"Then from the rattlesnake's skin, with a sudden, contemptuous gesture,"
17236,JOHN ALDEN,"Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets"
17237,JOHN ALDEN,"Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,"
17238,JOHN ALDEN,"Saying, in thundering tones: ""Here, take it! this is your answer!"""
17239,JOHN ALDEN,"Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,"
17240,JOHN ALDEN,"Bearing the serpent's skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,"
17241,JOHN ALDEN,Winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest.
17242,JOHN ALDEN,

17247,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER
17248,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17249,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Just in the gray of the dawn, as the mists uprose from the meadows,"
17250,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,There was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth;
17251,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Clanging and clicking of arms, and the order imperative, ""Forward!"""
17252,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Given in tone suppressed, a tramp of feet, and then silence."
17253,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Figures ten, in the mist, marched slowly out of the village."
17254,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Standish the stalwart it was, with eight of his valorous army,"
17255,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Led by their Indian guide, by Hobomok, friend of the white men,"
17256,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage.
17257,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Giants they seemed in the mist, or the mighty men of King David;"
17258,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Giants in heart they were, who believed in God and the Bible,--"
17259,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Ay, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines."
17260,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning;
17261,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Under them loud on the sands, the serried billows, advancing,"
17262,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Fired along the line, and in regular order retreated."
17263,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17264,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Many a mile had they marched, when at length the village of Plymouth"
17265,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Woke from its sleep, and arose, intent on its manifold labors."
17266,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Sweet was the air and soft; and slowly the smoke from the chimneys
17267,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Rose over roofs of thatch, and pointed steadily eastward;"
17268,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Men came forth from the doors, and paused and talked of the weather,"
17269,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Said that the wind had changed, and was blowing fair for the Mayflower;"
17270,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Talked of their Captain's departure, and all the dangers that menaced,"
17271,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"He being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence."
17272,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Merrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women"
17273,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household.
17274,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Out of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming;"
17275,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains;
17276,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Beautiful on the sails of the Mayflower riding at anchor,"
17277,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter.
17278,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas,"
17279,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Rent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors."
17280,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Suddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean,"
17281,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Darted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang"
17282,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Loud over field and forest the cannon's roar, and the echoes"
17283,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Heard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure!"
17284,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Ah! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people!
17285,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Meekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible,"
17286,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Meekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty!"
17287,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth,"
17288,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Men and women and children, all hurrying down to the sea-shore,"
17289,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Eager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the Mayflower,"
17290,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Homeward bound o'er the sea, and leaving them here in the desert."
17291,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17292,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Foremost among them was Alden.  All night he had lain without slumber,"
17293,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever.
17294,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"He had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the council,"
17295,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Stalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur,"
17296,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Sometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like swearing."
17297,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Once he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence;"
17298,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then he had turned away, and said: ""I will not awake him;"
17299,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Let him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!"""
17300,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then he extinguished the light, and threw himself down on his pallet,"
17301,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Dressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the morning,--"
17302,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in Flanders,--"
17303,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action."
17304,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,But with the dawn he arose; in the twilight Alden beheld him
17305,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Put on his corselet of steel, and all the rest of his armor,"
17306,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,"
17307,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Take from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber."
17308,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,"
17309,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Often his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon;"
17310,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"All the old friendship came back, with its tender and grateful emotions;"
17311,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"But his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him,--"
17312,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Pride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult."
17313,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"So he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,"
17314,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!"
17315,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,"
17316,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Joined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,"
17317,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Joined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,"
17318,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore,"
17319,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a door-step"
17320,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Into a world unknown,--the corner-stone of a nation!"
17321,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17322,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"There with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient"
17323,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Lest he should lose the tide, or the wind might shift to the eastward,"
17324,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Square-built, hearty, and strong, with an odor of ocean about him,"
17325,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Speaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels"
17326,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Into his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together"
17327,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Into his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered."
17328,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Nearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gunwale,"
17329,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,"
17330,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Seated erect on the thwarts, all ready and eager for starting."
17331,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,"
17332,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,"
17333,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.
17334,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla"
17335,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing."
17336,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,"
17337,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,"
17338,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,"
17339,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction."
17340,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!"
17341,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,"
17342,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine!"
17343,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"""Here I remain!"" he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,"
17344,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,"
17345,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong."
17346,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"""Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,"
17347,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean.
17348,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like,"
17349,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection."
17350,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!"
17351,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me; I heed not"
17352,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Either your warning or menace, or any omen of evil!"
17353,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"There is no land so sacred, no air so pure and so wholesome,"
17354,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"As is the air she breathes, and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps."
17355,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Here for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence"
17356,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Hover around her for ever, protecting, supporting her weakness;"
17357,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Yes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing,"
17358,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!"""
17359,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17360,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Meanwhile the Master alert, but with dignified air and important,"
17361,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather,"
17362,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Walked about on the sands; and the people crowded around him
17363,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Saying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance."
17364,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were grasping a tiller,"
17365,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Into the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel,"
17366,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry,"
17367,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow,"
17368,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Short allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel!"
17369,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims.
17370,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,O strong hearts and true! not one went back in the Mayflower!
17371,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"No, not one looked back, who had set his hand to this ploughing!"
17372,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17373,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors
17374,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Heaving the windlass round, and hoisting the ponderous anchor."
17375,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then the yards were braced, and all sails set to the west-wind,"
17376,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Blowing steady and strong; and the Mayflower sailed from the harbor,"
17377,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Rounded the point of the Gurnet, and leaving far to the southward"
17378,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Island and cape of sand, and the Field of the First Encounter,"
17379,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Took the wind on her quarter, and stood for the open Atlantic,"
17380,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Borne on the send of the sea, and the swelling hearts of the Pilgrims."
17381,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,
17382,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,"
17383,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Much endeared to them all, as something living and human;"
17384,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Then, as if filled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic,"
17385,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth"
17386,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Said, ""Let us pray!"" and they prayed, and thanked the Lord and took courage."
17387,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock, and above them"
17388,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death, and their kindred"
17389,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Seemed to awake in their graves, and to join in the prayer that they uttered."
17390,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Sun-illumined and white, on the eastern verge of the ocean"
17391,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Gleamed the departing sail, like a marble slab in a graveyard;"
17392,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,Buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping.
17393,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Lo! as they turned to depart, they saw the form of an Indian,"
17394,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Watching them from the hill; but while they spake with each other,"
17395,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Pointing with outstretched hands, and saying, ""Look!"" he had vanished."
17396,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little,"
17397,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Musing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows"
17398,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Round the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine,"
17399,THE SAILING OF THE MAYFLOWER,"Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters."

17406,PRISCILLA,
17407,PRISCILLA,"Thus for a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean,"
17408,PRISCILLA,"Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;"
17409,PRISCILLA,"And as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the loadstone,"
17410,PRISCILLA,"Whatsoever it touches, by subtile laws of its nature,"
17411,PRISCILLA,"Lo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him."
17412,PRISCILLA,
17413,PRISCILLA,"""Are you so much offended, you will not speak to me?"" said she."
17414,PRISCILLA,"""Am I so much to blame, that yesterday, when you were pleading"
17415,PRISCILLA,"Warmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward,"
17416,PRISCILLA,"Pleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum?"
17417,PRISCILLA,"Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying"
17418,PRISCILLA,"What I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it;"
17419,PRISCILLA,"For there are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion,"
17420,PRISCILLA,"That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble"
17421,PRISCILLA,"Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret,"
17422,PRISCILLA,"Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together."
17423,PRISCILLA,"Yesterday I was shocked, when I heard you speak of Miles Standish,"
17424,PRISCILLA,"Praising his virtues, transforming his very defects into virtues,"
17425,PRISCILLA,"Praising his courage and strength, and even his fighting in Flanders,"
17426,PRISCILLA,"As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman,"
17427,PRISCILLA,"Quite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero."
17428,PRISCILLA,"Therefore I spake as I did, by an irresistible impulse."
17429,PRISCILLA,"You will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship between us,"
17430,PRISCILLA,"Which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken!"""
17431,PRISCILLA,"Thereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend of Miles Standish:"
17432,PRISCILLA,"""I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry,"
17433,PRISCILLA,"Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping."""
17434,PRISCILLA,"""No!"" interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt and decisive;"
17435,PRISCILLA,"""No; you were angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely."
17436,PRISCILLA,"It was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman"
17437,PRISCILLA,"Long to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,"
17438,PRISCILLA,Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.
17439,PRISCILLA,Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women
17440,PRISCILLA,"Sunless and silent and deep, like subterranean rivers"
17441,PRISCILLA,"Running through caverns of darkness, unheard, unseen, and unfruitful,"
17442,PRISCILLA,"Chafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs."""
17443,PRISCILLA,"Thereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:"
17444,PRISCILLA,"""Heaven forbid it, Priscilla; and truly they seem to me always"
17445,PRISCILLA,"More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden,"
17446,PRISCILLA,"More like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,"
17447,PRISCILLA,"Filling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!"""
17448,PRISCILLA,"""Ah, by these words, I can see,"" again interrupted the maiden,"
17449,PRISCILLA,"""How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying."
17450,PRISCILLA,"When from the depths of my heart, in pain and with secret misgiving,"
17451,PRISCILLA,"Frankly I speak to you, asking for sympathy only and kindness,"
17452,PRISCILLA,"Straightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct and in earnest,"
17453,PRISCILLA,"Turn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases."
17454,PRISCILLA,"This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;"
17455,PRISCILLA,"For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,"
17456,PRISCILLA,"Lifting mine up to a higher, a more ethereal level."
17457,PRISCILLA,"Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly"
17458,PRISCILLA,"If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,"
17459,PRISCILLA,If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases
17460,PRISCILLA,"Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,"
17461,PRISCILLA,"But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting."""
17462,PRISCILLA,
17463,PRISCILLA,"Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,"
17464,PRISCILLA,"Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty."
17465,PRISCILLA,"He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,"
17466,PRISCILLA,"Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer."
17467,PRISCILLA,"So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined"
17468,PRISCILLA,"What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless."
17469,PRISCILLA,"""Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in all things"
17470,PRISCILLA,"Keep ourselves loyal to truth, and the sacred professions of friendship."
17471,PRISCILLA,"It is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:"
17472,PRISCILLA,"I have liked to be with you, to see you, to speak with you always."
17473,PRISCILLA,"So I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you"
17474,PRISCILLA,"Urge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain Miles Standish."
17475,PRISCILLA,For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship
17476,PRISCILLA,"Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him."""
17477,PRISCILLA,"Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,"
17478,PRISCILLA,"Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding so sorely,"
17479,PRISCILLA,"Healed by the touch of that hand, and he said, with a voice full of feeling:"
17480,PRISCILLA,"""Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship"
17481,PRISCILLA,"Let me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest and dearest!"""
17482,PRISCILLA,
17483,PRISCILLA,"Casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the Mayflower,"
17484,PRISCILLA,"Distant, but still in sight, and sinking below the horizon,"
17485,PRISCILLA,"Homeward together they walked, with a strange, indefinite feeling,"
17486,PRISCILLA,That all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert.
17487,PRISCILLA,"But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine,"
17488,PRISCILLA,"Lighter grew their hearts, and Priscilla said very archly:"
17489,PRISCILLA,"""Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians,"
17490,PRISCILLA,"Where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household,"
17491,PRISCILLA,"You may speak boldly, and tell me of all that happened between you,"
17492,PRISCILLA,"When you returned last night, and said how ungrateful you found me."""
17493,PRISCILLA,"Thereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole of the story,--"
17494,PRISCILLA,"Told her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish."
17495,PRISCILLA,"Whereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and earnest,"
17496,PRISCILLA,"""He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!"""
17497,PRISCILLA,"But as he gently rebuked her, and told her how much he had suffered,--"
17498,PRISCILLA,"How he had even determined to sail that day in the Mayflower,"
17499,PRISCILLA,"And had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers that threatened,--"
17500,PRISCILLA,"All her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent,"
17501,PRISCILLA,"""Truly I thank you for this: how good you have been to me always!"""
17502,PRISCILLA,
17503,PRISCILLA,"Thus, as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys,"
17504,PRISCILLA,"Taking three steps in advance, and one reluctantly backward,"
17505,PRISCILLA,"Urged by importunate zeal, and withheld by pangs of contrition;"
17506,PRISCILLA,"Slowly but steadily onward, receding yet ever advancing,"
17507,PRISCILLA,"Journeyed this Puritan youth to the Holy Land of his longings,"
17508,PRISCILLA,"Urged by the fervor of love, and withheld by remorseful misgivings."

17515,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17516,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Meanwhile the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily northward,"
17517,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Winding through forest and swamp, and along the trend of the sea-shore,"
17518,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"All day long, with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger"
17519,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Burning and crackling within, and the sulphurous odor of powder"
17520,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest.
17521,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Silent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort;"
17522,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"He who was used to success, and to easy victories always,"
17523,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Thus to be flouted, rejected, and laughed to scorn by a maiden,"
17524,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted!
17525,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Ah! 't was too much to be borne, and he fretted and chafed in his armor!"
17526,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17527,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"""I alone am to blame,"" he muttered, ""for mine was the folly."
17528,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"What has a rough old soldier, grown grim and gray in the harness,"
17529,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing of maidens?"
17530,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"'T was but a dream,--let it pass,--let it vanish like so many others!"
17531,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"What I thought was a flower, is only a weed, and is worthless;"
17532,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Out of my heart will I pluck it, and throw it away, and henceforward"
17533,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Be but a fighter of battles, a lover and wooer of dangers!"""
17534,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,"
17535,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"While he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,"
17536,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Looking up at the trees, and the constellations beyond them."
17537,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17538,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,After a three days' march he came to an Indian encampment
17539,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Pitched on the edge of a meadow, between the sea and the forest;"
17540,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Women at work by the tents, and the warriors, horrid with war-paint,"
17541,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Seated about a fire, and smoking and talking together;"
17542,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Who, when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men,"
17543,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket,"
17544,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Straightway leaped to their feet, and two, from among them advancing,"
17545,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Came to parley with Standish, and offer him furs as a present;"
17546,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Friendship was in their looks, but in their hearts there was hatred."
17547,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Braves of the tribe were these, and brothers gigantic in stature,"
17548,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Huge as Goliath of Gath, or the terrible Og, king of Bashan;"
17549,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"One was Pecksuot named, and the other was called Wattawamat."
17550,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum,"
17551,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Two-edged, trenchant knives, with points as sharp as a needle."
17552,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Other arms had they none, for they were cunning and crafty."
17553,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"""Welcome, English!"" they said,--these words they had learned from the traders"
17554,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Touching at times on the coast, to barter and chaffer for peltries."
17555,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Then in their native tongue they began to parley with Standish,"
17556,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Through his guide and interpreter Hobomok, friend of the white man,"
17557,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Begging for blankets and knives, but mostly for muskets and powder,"
17558,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Kept by the white man, they said, concealed, with the plague, in his cellars,"
17559,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Ready to be let loose, and destroy his brother the red man!"
17560,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"But when Standish refused, and said he would give them the Bible,"
17561,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17562,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Suddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster."
17563,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other,"
17564,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"And, with a lofty demeanor, thus vauntingly spake to the Captain:"
17565,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"""Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain,"
17566,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Angry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat
17567,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Is not afraid at the sight.  He was not born of a woman,"
17568,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"But on a mountain, at night, from an oak-tree riven by lightning,"
17569,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Forth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him,"
17570,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Shouting, 'Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat?'"""
17571,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Then he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left hand,"
17572,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Held it aloft and displayed a woman's face on the handle,"
17573,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Saying, with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning:"
17574,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"""I have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle;"
17575,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"By and by they shall marry; and there will be plenty of children!"""
17576,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17577,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Then stood Pecksuot forth, self-vaunting, insulting Miles Standish:"
17578,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"While with his fingers he petted the knife that hung at his bosom,"
17579,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Drawing it half from its sheath, and plunging it back, as he muttered,"
17580,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"""By and by it shall see; it shall eat; ah, ha! but shall speak not!"
17581,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,This is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us!
17582,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"He is a little man; let him go and work with the women!"""
17583,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17584,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Meanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians
17585,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest,"
17586,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Feigning to look for game, with arrows set on their bow-strings,"
17587,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush.
17588,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"But undaunted he stood, and dissembled and treated them smoothly;"
17589,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"So the old chronicles say, that were writ in the days of the fathers."
17590,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"But when he heard their defiance, the boast, the taunt, and the insult,"
17591,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"All the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish,"
17592,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Boiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his temples."
17593,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from its scabbard,"
17594,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Plunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage"
17595,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Fell with his face to the sky, and a fiendlike fierceness upon it."
17596,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war-whoop,"
17597,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"And, like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December,"
17598,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows,"
17599,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Then came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the lightning,"
17600,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Out of the lightning thunder, and death unseen ran before it."
17601,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Frightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket,"
17602,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Hotly pursued and beset; but their sachem, the brave Wattawamat,"
17603,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Fled not; he was dead.  Unswerving and swift had a bullet
17604,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Passed through his brain, and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward,"
17605,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers.
17606,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17607,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"There on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay, and above them,"
17608,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Silent, with folded arms, stood Hobomok, friend of the white man."
17609,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of Plymouth:
17610,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"""Pecksuot bragged very loud, of his courage, his strength, and his stature,--"
17611,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Mocked the great Captain, and called him a little man; but I see now"
17612,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you!"""
17613,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,
17614,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles Standish.
17615,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"When the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth,"
17616,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,And as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat
17617,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Scowled from the roof of the fort, which at once was a church and a fortress,"
17618,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"All who beheld it rejoiced, and praised the Lord, and took courage."
17619,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Only Priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror,"
17620,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,Thanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles Standish;
17621,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"Shrinking, fearing almost, lest, coming home from his battles,"
17622,THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH,"He should lay claim to her hand, as the prize and reward of his valor."

17630,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Month after month passed away, and in Autumn the ships of the merchants"
17631,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Came with kindred and friends, with cattle and corn for the Pilgrims."
17632,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"All in the village was peace; the men were intent on their labors,"
17633,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Busy with hewing and building, with garden-plot and with merestead,"
17634,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Busy with breaking the glebe, and mowing the grass in the meadows,"
17635,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Searching the sea for its fish, and hunting the deer in the forest."
17636,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,All in the village was peace; but at times the rumor of warfare
17637,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Filled the air with alarm, and the apprehension of danger."
17638,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Bravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with his forces,"
17639,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,"
17640,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations.
17641,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Anger was still in his heart, but at times the remorse and contrition"
17642,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak,"
17643,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Came like a rising tide, that encounters the rush of a river,"
17644,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Staying its current awhile, but making it bitter and brackish."
17645,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,
17646,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Meanwhile Alden at home had built him a new habitation,"
17647,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Solid, substantial, of timber rough-hewn from the firs of the forest."
17648,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Wooden-barred was the door, and the roof was covered with rushes;"
17649,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Latticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper,"
17650,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Oiled to admit the light, while wind and rain were excluded."
17651,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"There too he dug a well, and around it planted an orchard:"
17652,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard.
17653,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Close to the house was the stall, where, safe and secure from annoyance,"
17654,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Raghorn, the snow-white steer, that had fallen to Alden's allotment"
17655,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"In the division of cattle, might ruminate in the night-time"
17656,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Over the pastures he cropped, made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal."
17657,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,
17658,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Oft when his labor was finished, with eager feet would the dreamer"
17659,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of Priscilla,"
17660,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Led by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy,"
17661,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Pleasure disguised as duty, and love in the semblance of friendship."
17662,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Ever of her he thought, when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling;"
17663,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Ever of her he thought, when he delved in the soil of his garden;"
17664,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Ever of her he thought, when he read in his Bible on Sunday"
17665,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Praise of the virtuous woman, as she is described in the Proverbs,--"
17666,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"How the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always,"
17667,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"How all the days of her life she will do him good, and not evil,"
17668,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"How she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness,"
17669,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"How she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff,"
17670,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"How she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household,"
17671,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving!
17672,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,
17673,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"So as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the Autumn,"
17674,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Alden, who opposite sat, and was watching her dexterous fingers,"
17675,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune,"
17676,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"After a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle."
17677,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"""Truly, Priscilla,"" he said, ""when I see you spinning and spinning,"
17678,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Never idle a moment, but thrifty and thoughtful of others,"
17679,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Suddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment;"
17680,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"You are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner."""
17681,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter; the spindle
17682,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Uttered an angry snarl, and the thread snapped short in her fingers;"
17683,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"While the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, continued:"
17684,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"""You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia;"
17685,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton,"
17686,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Who, as she rode on her palfrey, o'er valley and meadow and mountain,"
17687,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle.
17688,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"She was so thrifty and good, that her name passed into a proverb."
17689,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"So shall it be with your own, when the spinning-wheel shall no longer"
17690,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Hum in the house of the farmer, and fill its chambers with music."
17691,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Then shall the mothers, reproving, relate how it was in their childhood,"
17692,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Praising the good old times, and the days of Priscilla the spinner!"""
17693,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden,"
17694,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest,"
17695,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning,"
17696,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Thus making answer, meanwhile, to the flattering phrases of Alden:"
17697,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"""Come, you must not be idle; if I am a pattern for housewives,"
17698,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands.
17699,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Hold this skein on your hands, while I wind it, ready for knitting;"
17700,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Then who knows but hereafter, when fashions have changed and the manners,"
17701,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John Alden!"""
17702,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Thus, with a jest and a laugh, the skein on his hands she adjusted,"
17703,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"He sitting awkwardly there, with his arms extended before him,"
17704,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"She standing graceful, erect, and winding the thread from his fingers,"
17705,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding,"
17706,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Sometimes touching his hands, as she disentangled expertly"
17707,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Twist or knot in the yarn, unawares--for how could she help it?--"
17708,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body.
17709,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,
17710,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Lo! in the midst of this scene, a breathless messenger entered,"
17711,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village.
17712,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Yes; Miles Standish was dead!--an Indian had brought them the tidings,--"
17713,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Slain by a poisoned arrow, shot down in the front of the battle,"
17714,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Into an ambush beguiled, cut off with the whole of his forces;"
17715,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"All the town would be burned, and all the people be murdered!"
17716,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,Such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers.
17717,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Silent and statue-like stood Priscilla, her face looking backward"
17718,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Still at the face of the speaker, her arms uplifted in horror;"
17719,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"But John Alden, upstarting, as if the barb of the arrow"
17720,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own, and had sundered"
17721,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Once and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive,"
17722,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Wild with excess of sensation, the awful delight of his freedom,"
17723,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Mingled with pain and regret, unconscious of what he was doing,"
17724,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Clasped, almost with a groan, the motionless form of Priscilla,"
17725,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Pressing her close to his heart, as for ever his own, and exclaiming:"
17726,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"""Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put them asunder!"""
17727,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,
17728,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Even as rivulets twain, from distant and separate sources,"
17729,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Seeing each other afar, as they leap from the rocks, and pursuing"
17730,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Each one its devious path, but drawing nearer and nearer,"
17731,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Rush together at last, at their trysting-place in the forest;"
17732,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"So these lives that had run thus far in separate channels,"
17733,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Coming in sight of each other, then swerving and flowing asunder,"
17734,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Parted by barriers strong, but drawing nearer and nearer,"
17735,THE SPINNING-WHEEL,"Rushed together at last, and one was lost in the other."

17745,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead,"

17749,THE WEDDING-DAY,
17750,THE WEDDING-DAY,This was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.

17752,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Graced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the Gospel,"
17753,THE WEDDING-DAY,One with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven.
17754,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz."

17759,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in affection,"
17760,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Speaking of life and of death, and imploring divine benedictions."
17761,THE WEDDING-DAY,
17762,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,"
17763,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Clad in armor of steel, a sombre and sorrowful figure!"
17764,THE WEDDING-DAY,Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?
17765,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?"
17766,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Is it a phantom of air,--a bodiless, spectral illusion?"
17767,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?"
17768,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;"
17769,THE WEDDING-DAY,Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression
17770,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them,"
17771,THE WEDDING-DAY,As when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud
17772,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Grows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness."
17773,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,"
17774,THE WEDDING-DAY,As if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention.
17775,THE WEDDING-DAY,"But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,"
17776,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement"
17777,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!"
17778,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Grasping the bridegroom's hand, he said with emotion, ""Forgive me!"
17779,THE WEDDING-DAY,"I have been angry and hurt,--too long have I cherished the feeling;"
17780,THE WEDDING-DAY,"I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended."
17781,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,"
17782,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning for error."
17783,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden."""
17784,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Thereupon answered the bridegroom: ""Let all be forgotten between us,--"
17785,THE WEDDING-DAY,"All save the dear, old friendship, and that shall grow older and dearer!"""
17786,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,"
17787,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Gravely, and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England,"
17788,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Something of camp and of court, of town and of country, commingled,"
17789,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband."
17790,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Then he said with a smile: ""I should have remembered the adage,--"
17791,THE WEDDING-DAY,"If you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and moreover,"
17792,THE WEDDING-DAY,"No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!"""
17793,THE WEDDING-DAY,
17794,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Great was the people's amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,"
17795,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Thus to behold once more the sun-burnt face of their Captain,"
17796,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,"
17797,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,"
17798,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other,"
17799,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,"
17800,THE WEDDING-DAY,"He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,"
17801,THE WEDDING-DAY,Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.
17802,THE WEDDING-DAY,
17803,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway,"
17804,THE WEDDING-DAY,Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.
17805,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,"
17806,THE WEDDING-DAY,Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation;
17807,THE WEDDING-DAY,"There were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the sea-shore,"
17808,THE WEDDING-DAY,"There the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows;"
17809,THE WEDDING-DAY,"But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,"
17810,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Filled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the ocean."
17811,THE WEDDING-DAY,
17812,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,"
17813,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying,"
17814,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Each with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncompleted."
17815,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,"
17816,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Alden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,"
17817,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Brought out his snow-white steer, obeying the hand of its master,"
17818,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,"
17819,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle."
17820,THE WEDDING-DAY,"She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;"
17821,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant."
17822,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,"
17823,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,"
17824,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey."
17825,THE WEDDING-DAY,"""Nothing is wanting now,"" he said with a smile, ""but the distaff;"
17826,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Then you would be in truth my queen, my beautiful Bertha!"""
17827,THE WEDDING-DAY,
17828,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation,"
17829,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together."
17830,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Pleasantly murmured the brook, as they crossed the ford in the forest,"
17831,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Pleased with the image that passed, like a dream of love through its bosom,"
17832,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Tremulous, floating in air, o'er the depths of the azure abysses."
17833,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors,"
17834,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Gleaming on purple grapes, that, from branches above them suspended,"
17835,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir-tree,"
17836,THE WEDDING-DAY,Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol.
17837,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Like a picture it seemed of the primitive, pastoral ages,"
17838,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Fresh with the youth of the world, and recalling Rebecca and Isaac,"
17839,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Old and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always,"
17840,THE WEDDING-DAY,"Love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers,"
17841,THE WEDDING-DAY,So through the Plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession.

18144,THE PHANTOM SHIP,May be found in prose the legend

18146,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18147,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"A ship sailed from New Haven,"
18148,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"And the keen and frosty airs,"
18149,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"That filled her sails at parting,"

18151,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18152,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"""O Lord! if it be thy pleasure""--"
18153,THE PHANTOM SHIP,Thus prayed the old divine--
18154,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"""To bury our friends in the ocean,"
18155,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Take them, for they are thine!"""
18156,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18157,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"But Master Lamberton muttered,"

18159,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"""This ship is so crank and walty"
18160,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"I fear our grave she will be!"""
18161,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18162,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"And the ships that came from England,"
18163,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"When the winter months were gone,"
18164,THE PHANTOM SHIP,Brought no tidings of this vessel
18165,THE PHANTOM SHIP,Nor of Master Lamberton.
18166,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18167,THE PHANTOM SHIP,This put the people to praying
18168,THE PHANTOM SHIP,That the Lord would let them hear

18175,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Of a windy afternoon,"
18176,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18177,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"When, steadily steering landward,"
18178,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"A ship was seen below,"
18179,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"And they knew it was Lamberton, Master,"
18180,THE PHANTOM SHIP,Who sailed so long ago.
18181,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18182,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"On she came, with a cloud of canvas,"
18183,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Right against the wind that blew,"

18185,THE PHANTOM SHIP,The faces of the crew.
18186,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18187,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Then fell her straining topmasts,"
18188,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Hanging tangled in the shrouds,"
18189,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"And her sails were loosened and lifted,"
18190,THE PHANTOM SHIP,And blown away like clouds.
18191,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18192,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"And the masts, with all their rigging,"
18193,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Fell slowly, one by one,"
18194,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"And the hulk dilated and vanished,"
18195,THE PHANTOM SHIP,As a sea-mist in the sun!
18196,THE PHANTOM SHIP,
18197,THE PHANTOM SHIP,And the people who saw this marvel
18198,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"Each said unto his friend,"
18199,THE PHANTOM SHIP,"That this was the mould of their vessel,"
18200,THE PHANTOM SHIP,And thus her tragic end.
18201,THE PHANTOM SHIP,

18432,THE TWO ANGELS,Passed o'er our village as the morning broke;
18433,THE TWO ANGELS,"The dawn was on their faces, and beneath,"
18434,THE TWO ANGELS,The sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke.
18435,THE TWO ANGELS,
18436,THE TWO ANGELS,"Their attitude and aspect were the same,"
18437,THE TWO ANGELS,Alike their features and their robes of white;
18438,THE TWO ANGELS,"But one was crowned with amaranth, as with flame,"
18439,THE TWO ANGELS,"And one with asphodels, like flakes of light."
18440,THE TWO ANGELS,
18441,THE TWO ANGELS,I saw them pause on their celestial way;
18442,THE TWO ANGELS,"Then said I, with deep fear and doubt oppressed,"
18443,THE TWO ANGELS,"""Beat not so loud, my heart, lest thou betray"
18444,THE TWO ANGELS,"The place where thy beloved are at rest!"""
18445,THE TWO ANGELS,
18446,THE TWO ANGELS,"And he who wore the crown of asphodels,"
18447,THE TWO ANGELS,"Descending, at my door began to knock,"
18448,THE TWO ANGELS,"And my soul sank within me, as in wells"
18449,THE TWO ANGELS,The waters sink before an earthquake's shock.
18450,THE TWO ANGELS,
18451,THE TWO ANGELS,"I recognized the nameless agony,"
18452,THE TWO ANGELS,"The terror and the tremor and the pain,"
18453,THE TWO ANGELS,"That oft before had filled or haunted me,"
18454,THE TWO ANGELS,And now returned with threefold strength again.
18455,THE TWO ANGELS,
18456,THE TWO ANGELS,"The door I opened to my heavenly guest,"
18457,THE TWO ANGELS,"And listened, for I thought I heard God's voice;"
18458,THE TWO ANGELS,"And, knowing whatsoe'er he sent was best,"
18459,THE TWO ANGELS,Dared neither to lament nor to rejoice.
18460,THE TWO ANGELS,
18461,THE TWO ANGELS,"Then with a smile, that filled the house with light,"
18462,THE TWO ANGELS,"""My errand is not Death, but Life,"" he said;"
18463,THE TWO ANGELS,"And ere I answered, passing out of sight,"
18464,THE TWO ANGELS,On his celestial embassy he sped.
18465,THE TWO ANGELS,
18466,THE TWO ANGELS,"'T was at thy door, O friend! and not at mine,"
18467,THE TWO ANGELS,"The angel with the amaranthine wreath,"
18468,THE TWO ANGELS,"Pausing, descended, and with voice divine,"
18469,THE TWO ANGELS,Whispered a word that had a sound like Death.
18470,THE TWO ANGELS,
18471,THE TWO ANGELS,"Then fell upon the house a sudden gloom,"
18472,THE TWO ANGELS,A shadow on those features fair and thin;
18473,THE TWO ANGELS,"And softly, from that hushed and darkened room,"
18474,THE TWO ANGELS,"Two angels issued, where but one went in."
18475,THE TWO ANGELS,
18476,THE TWO ANGELS,"All is of God!  If he but wave his hand,"
18477,THE TWO ANGELS,"The mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud,"
18478,THE TWO ANGELS,"Till, with a smile of light on sea and land,"
18479,THE TWO ANGELS,Lo! he looks back from the departing cloud.
18480,THE TWO ANGELS,
18481,THE TWO ANGELS,Angels of Life and Death alike are his;
18482,THE TWO ANGELS,Without his leave they pass no threshold o'er;
18483,THE TWO ANGELS,"Who, then, would wish or dare, believing this,"
18484,THE TWO ANGELS,Against his messengers to shut the door?
18485,THE TWO ANGELS,
18486,THE TWO ANGELS,
18487,THE TWO ANGELS,
18488,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT
18489,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
18490,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"In broad daylight, and at noon,"
18491,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Yesterday I saw the moon
18492,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Sailing high, but faint and white,"
18493,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,As a school-boy's paper kite.
18494,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
18495,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"In broad daylight, yesterday,"
18496,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,I read a Poet's mystic lay;
18497,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,And it seemed to me at most
18498,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"As a phantom, or a ghost."
18499,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
18500,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,But at length the feverish day
18501,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Like a passion died away,"
18502,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"And the night, serene and still,"
18503,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Fell on village, vale, and hill."
18504,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
18505,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Then the moon, in all her pride,"
18506,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,"Like a spirit glorified,"
18507,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Filled and overflowed the night
18508,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,With revelations of her light.
18509,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,
18510,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,And the Poet's song again
18511,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Passed like music through my brain;
18512,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,Night interpreted to me
18513,DAYLIGHT AND MOONLIGHT,All its grace and mystery.

18518,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18519,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"How strange it seems!  These Hebrews in their graves,"
18520,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Close by the street of this fair seaport town,"
18521,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Silent beside the never-silent waves,"
18522,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,At rest in all this moving up and down!
18523,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18524,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"The trees are white with dust, that o'er their sleep"
18525,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Wave their broad curtains in the south-wind's breath,"
18526,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,While underneath such leafy tents they keep
18527,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"The long, mysterious Exodus of Death."
18528,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18529,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"And these sepulchral stones, so old and brown,"
18530,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"That pave with level flags their burial-place,"
18531,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Seem like the tablets of the Law, thrown down"
18532,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,And broken by Moses at the mountain's base.
18533,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18534,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"The very names recorded here are strange,"
18535,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Of foreign accent, and of different climes;"
18536,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Alvares and Rivera interchange
18537,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,With Abraham and Jacob of old times.
18538,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18539,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"""Blessed be God! for he created Death!"""
18540,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"The mourners said, ""and Death is rest and peace"";"
18541,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Then added, in the certainty of faith,"
18542,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"""And giveth Life that never more shall cease."""
18543,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18544,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Closed are the portals of their Synagogue,"
18545,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"No Psalms of David now the silence break,"
18546,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,No Rabbi reads the ancient Decalogue
18547,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,In the grand dialect the Prophets spake.
18548,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18549,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Gone are the living, but the dead remain,"
18550,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"And not neglected; for a hand unseen,"
18551,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Scattering its bounty, like a summer rain,"
18552,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Still keeps their graves and their remembrance green.
18553,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18554,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"How came they here?  What burst of Christian hate,"
18555,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"What persecution, merciless and blind,"
18556,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Drove o'er the sea--that desert desolate--
18557,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,These Ishmaels and Hagars of mankind?
18558,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18559,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"They lived in narrow streets and lanes obscure,"
18560,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Ghetto and Judenstrass, in mirk and mire;"
18561,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Taught in the school of patience to endure
18562,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,The life of anguish and the death of fire.
18563,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18564,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"All their lives long, with the unleavened bread"
18565,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"And bitter herbs of exile and its fears,"
18566,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"The wasting famine of the heart they fed,"
18567,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,And slaked its thirst with marah of their tears.
18568,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18569,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Anathema maranatha! was the cry
18570,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"That rang from town to town, from street to street;"
18571,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,At every gate the accursed Mordecai
18572,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Was mocked and jeered, and spurned by Christian feet."
18573,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18574,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Pride and humiliation hand in hand
18575,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Walked with them through the world where'er they went;
18576,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Trampled and beaten were they as the sand,"
18577,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,And yet unshaken as the continent.
18578,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18579,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,For in the background figures vague and vast
18580,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Of patriarchs and of prophets rose sublime,"
18581,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,And all the great traditions of the Past
18582,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,They saw reflected in the coming time.
18583,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18584,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,And thus for ever with reverted look
18585,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"The mystic volume of the world they read,"
18586,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Spelling it backward, like a Hebrew book,"
18587,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,Till life became a Legend of the Dead.
18588,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,
18589,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,But ah! what once has been shall be no more!
18590,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,The groaning earth in travail and in pain
18591,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,"Brings forth its races, but does not restore,"
18592,THE JEWISH CEMETERY AT NEWPORT,And the dead nations never rise again.

18597,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18598,OLIVER BASSELIN,In the Valley of the Vire
18599,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Still is seen an ancient mill,"
18600,OLIVER BASSELIN,"With its gables quaint and queer,"
18601,OLIVER BASSELIN,"And beneath the window-sill,"
18602,OLIVER BASSELIN,"On the stone,"
18603,OLIVER BASSELIN,These words alone:
18604,OLIVER BASSELIN,"""Oliver Basselin lived here."""
18605,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18606,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Far above it, on the steep,"
18607,OLIVER BASSELIN,Ruined stands the old Chateau;
18608,OLIVER BASSELIN,Nothing but the donjon-keep
18609,OLIVER BASSELIN,Left for shelter or for show.
18610,OLIVER BASSELIN,Its vacant eyes
18611,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Stare at the skies,"
18612,OLIVER BASSELIN,Stare at the valley green and deep.
18613,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18614,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Once a convent, old and brown,"
18615,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Looked, but ah! it looks no more,"
18616,OLIVER BASSELIN,From the neighboring hillside down
18617,OLIVER BASSELIN,On the rushing and the roar
18618,OLIVER BASSELIN,Of the stream
18619,OLIVER BASSELIN,Whose sunny gleam
18620,OLIVER BASSELIN,Cheers the little Norman town.
18621,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18622,OLIVER BASSELIN,"In that darksome mill of stone,"
18623,OLIVER BASSELIN,"To the water's dash and din,"
18624,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Careless, humble, and unknown,"
18625,OLIVER BASSELIN,Sang the poet Basselin
18626,OLIVER BASSELIN,Songs that fill
18627,OLIVER BASSELIN,That ancient mill
18628,OLIVER BASSELIN,With a splendor of its own.
18629,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18630,OLIVER BASSELIN,Never feeling of unrest
18631,OLIVER BASSELIN,Broke the pleasant dream he dreamed;
18632,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Only made to be his nest,"
18633,OLIVER BASSELIN,All the lovely valley seemed;
18634,OLIVER BASSELIN,No desire
18635,OLIVER BASSELIN,Of soaring higher
18636,OLIVER BASSELIN,Stirred or fluttered in his breast.
18637,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18638,OLIVER BASSELIN,"True, his songs were not divine;"
18639,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Were not songs of that high art,"
18640,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Which, as winds do in the pine,"
18641,OLIVER BASSELIN,Find an answer in each heart;
18642,OLIVER BASSELIN,But the mirth
18643,OLIVER BASSELIN,Of this green earth
18644,OLIVER BASSELIN,Laughed and revelled in his line.
18645,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18646,OLIVER BASSELIN,"From the alehouse and the inn,"
18647,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Opening on the narrow street,"
18648,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Came the loud, convivial din,"
18649,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Singing and applause of feet,"
18650,OLIVER BASSELIN,The laughing lays
18651,OLIVER BASSELIN,That in those days
18652,OLIVER BASSELIN,Sang the poet Basselin.
18653,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18654,OLIVER BASSELIN,"In the castle, cased in steel,"
18655,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Knights, who fought at Agincourt,"
18656,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Watched and waited, spur on heel;"
18657,OLIVER BASSELIN,But the poet sang for sport
18658,OLIVER BASSELIN,Songs that rang
18659,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Another clang,"
18660,OLIVER BASSELIN,Songs that lowlier hearts could feel.
18661,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18662,OLIVER BASSELIN,"In the convent, clad in gray,"
18663,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Sat the monks in lonely cells,"
18664,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Paced the cloisters, knelt to pray,"
18665,OLIVER BASSELIN,And the poet heard their bells;
18666,OLIVER BASSELIN,But his rhymes
18667,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Found other chimes,"
18668,OLIVER BASSELIN,Nearer to the earth than they.
18669,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18670,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Gone are all the barons bold,"
18671,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Gone are all the knights and squires,"
18672,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Gone the abbot stern and cold,"
18673,OLIVER BASSELIN,And the brotherhood of friars;
18674,OLIVER BASSELIN,Not a name
18675,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Remains to fame,"
18676,OLIVER BASSELIN,From those mouldering days of old!
18677,OLIVER BASSELIN,
18678,OLIVER BASSELIN,But the poet's memory here
18679,OLIVER BASSELIN,Of the landscape makes a part;
18680,OLIVER BASSELIN,"Like the river, swift and clear,"
18681,OLIVER BASSELIN,Flows his song through many a heart;
18682,OLIVER BASSELIN,Haunting still
18683,OLIVER BASSELIN,"That ancient mill,"
18684,OLIVER BASSELIN,In the Valley of the Vire.

18722,VICTOR GALBRAITH,"Three balls are in his breast and brain,"
18723,VICTOR GALBRAITH,"But he rises out of the dust again,"

18806,MY LOST YOUTH,It flutters and murmurs still:
18807,MY LOST YOUTH,"""A boy's will is the wind's will,"
18808,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."""
18809,MY LOST YOUTH,
18810,MY LOST YOUTH,I remember the gleams and glooms that dart
18811,MY LOST YOUTH,Across the schoolboy's brain;
18812,MY LOST YOUTH,"The song and the silence in the heart,"
18813,MY LOST YOUTH,"That in part are prophecies, and in part"
18814,MY LOST YOUTH,Are longings wild and vain.
18815,MY LOST YOUTH,And the voice of that fitful song
18816,MY LOST YOUTH,"Sings on, and is never still:"
18817,MY LOST YOUTH,"""A boy's will is the wind's will,"
18818,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."""
18819,MY LOST YOUTH,
18820,MY LOST YOUTH,There are things of which I may not speak;
18821,MY LOST YOUTH,There are dreams that cannot die;
18822,MY LOST YOUTH,"There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,"
18823,MY LOST YOUTH,"And bring a pallor into the cheek,"
18824,MY LOST YOUTH,And a mist before the eye.
18825,MY LOST YOUTH,And the words of that fatal song
18826,MY LOST YOUTH,Come over me like a chill:
18827,MY LOST YOUTH,"""A boy's will is the wind's will,"
18828,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."""
18829,MY LOST YOUTH,
18830,MY LOST YOUTH,Strange to me now are the forms I meet
18831,MY LOST YOUTH,When I visit the dear old town;
18832,MY LOST YOUTH,"But the native air is pure and sweet,"
18833,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street,"
18834,MY LOST YOUTH,"As they balance up and down,"
18835,MY LOST YOUTH,"Are singing the beautiful song,"
18836,MY LOST YOUTH,Are sighing and whispering still:
18837,MY LOST YOUTH,"""A boy's will is the wind's will,"
18838,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."""
18839,MY LOST YOUTH,
18840,MY LOST YOUTH,"And Deering's Woods are fresh and fair,"
18841,MY LOST YOUTH,And with joy that is almost pain
18842,MY LOST YOUTH,"My heart goes back to wander there,"
18843,MY LOST YOUTH,"And among the dreams of the days that were,"
18844,MY LOST YOUTH,I find my lost youth again.
18845,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the strange and beautiful song,"
18846,MY LOST YOUTH,The groves are repeating it still:
18847,MY LOST YOUTH,"""A boy's will is the wind's will,"
18848,MY LOST YOUTH,"And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."""

18853,THE ROPEWALK,
18854,THE ROPEWALK,"In that building, long and low,"
18855,THE ROPEWALK,"With its windows all a-row,"
18856,THE ROPEWALK,"Like the port-holes of a hulk,"
18857,THE ROPEWALK,"Human spiders spin and spin,"
18858,THE ROPEWALK,Backward down their threads so thin
18859,THE ROPEWALK,"Dropping, each a hempen bulk."
18860,THE ROPEWALK,
18861,THE ROPEWALK,"At the end, an open door;"
18862,THE ROPEWALK,Squares of sunshine on the floor
18863,THE ROPEWALK,Light the long and dusky lane;
18864,THE ROPEWALK,"And the whirring of a wheel,"
18865,THE ROPEWALK,"Dull and drowsy, makes me feel"
18866,THE ROPEWALK,All its spokes are in my brain.
18867,THE ROPEWALK,
18868,THE ROPEWALK,As the spinners to the end
18869,THE ROPEWALK,"Downward go and reascend,"
18870,THE ROPEWALK,Gleam the long threads in the sun;
18871,THE ROPEWALK,While within this brain of mine
18872,THE ROPEWALK,Cobwebs brighter and more fine
18873,THE ROPEWALK,By the busy wheel are spun.
18874,THE ROPEWALK,
18875,THE ROPEWALK,"Two fair maidens in a swing,"
18876,THE ROPEWALK,"Like white doves upon the wing,"
18877,THE ROPEWALK,First before my vision pass;
18878,THE ROPEWALK,"Laughing, as their gentle hands"
18879,THE ROPEWALK,"Closely clasp the twisted strands,"
18880,THE ROPEWALK,At their shadow on the grass.
18881,THE ROPEWALK,
18882,THE ROPEWALK,"Then a booth of mountebanks,"
18883,THE ROPEWALK,"With its smell of tan and planks,"
18884,THE ROPEWALK,And a girl poised high in air
18885,THE ROPEWALK,"On a cord, in spangled dress,"
18886,THE ROPEWALK,"With a faded loveliness,"
18887,THE ROPEWALK,And a weary look of care.
18888,THE ROPEWALK,
18889,THE ROPEWALK,"Then a homestead among farms,"
18890,THE ROPEWALK,And a woman with bare arms
18891,THE ROPEWALK,Drawing water from a well;
18892,THE ROPEWALK,"As the bucket mounts apace,"
18893,THE ROPEWALK,"With it mounts her own fair face,"
18894,THE ROPEWALK,As at some magician's spell.
18895,THE ROPEWALK,
18896,THE ROPEWALK,"Then an old man in a tower,"
18897,THE ROPEWALK,"Ringing loud the noontide hour,"
18898,THE ROPEWALK,While the rope coils round and round
18899,THE ROPEWALK,"Like a serpent at his feet,"
18900,THE ROPEWALK,"And again, in swift retreat,"
18901,THE ROPEWALK,Nearly lifts him from the ground.
18902,THE ROPEWALK,
18903,THE ROPEWALK,"Then within a prison-yard,"
18904,THE ROPEWALK,"Faces fixed, and stern, and hard,"
18905,THE ROPEWALK,Laughter and indecent mirth;
18906,THE ROPEWALK,Ah! it is the gallows-tree!
18907,THE ROPEWALK,"Breath of Christian charity,"
18908,THE ROPEWALK,"Blow, and sweep it from the earth!"
18909,THE ROPEWALK,
18910,THE ROPEWALK,"Then a school-boy, with his kite"
18911,THE ROPEWALK,"Gleaming in a sky of light,"
18912,THE ROPEWALK,"And an eager, upward look;"
18913,THE ROPEWALK,Steeds pursued through lane and field;
18914,THE ROPEWALK,Fowlers with their snares concealed;
18915,THE ROPEWALK,And an angler by a brook.
18916,THE ROPEWALK,
18917,THE ROPEWALK,"Ships rejoicing in the breeze,"
18918,THE ROPEWALK,"Wrecks that float o'er unknown seas,"
18919,THE ROPEWALK,Anchors dragged through faithless sand;
18920,THE ROPEWALK,"Sea-fog drifting overhead,"
18921,THE ROPEWALK,"And, with lessening line and lead,"
18922,THE ROPEWALK,Sailors feeling for the land.
18923,THE ROPEWALK,
18924,THE ROPEWALK,"All these scenes do I behold,"
18925,THE ROPEWALK,"These, and many left untold,"
18926,THE ROPEWALK,In that building long and low;
18927,THE ROPEWALK,"While the wheel goes round and round,"
18928,THE ROPEWALK,"With a drowsy, dreamy sound,"
18929,THE ROPEWALK,And the spinners backward go.

18938,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,In the Red Sea of the Winter sunset.
18939,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18940,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"From the hundred chimneys of the village,"
18941,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Like the Afreet in the Arabian story,"
18942,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Smoky columns
18943,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Tower aloft into the air of amber.
18944,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18945,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,At the window winks the flickering fire-light;
18946,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Here and there the lamps of evening glimmer,"
18947,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Social watch-fires
18948,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Answering one another through the darkness.
18949,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18950,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"On the hearth the lighted logs are glowing,"
18951,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,And like Ariel in the cloven pine-tree
18952,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,For its freedom
18953,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Groans and sighs the air imprisoned in them.
18954,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18955,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"By the fireside there are old men seated,"
18956,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Seeing ruined cities in the ashes,"
18957,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Asking sadly
18958,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Of the Past what it can ne'er restore them.
18959,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18960,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"By the fireside there are youthful dreamers,"
18961,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Building castles fair, with stately stairways,"
18962,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Asking blindly
18963,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Of the Future what it cannot give them.
18964,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18965,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,By the fireside tragedies are acted
18966,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"In whose scenes appear two actors only,"
18967,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Wife and husband,"
18968,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,And above them God the sole spectator.
18969,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18970,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"By the fireside there are peace and comfort,"
18971,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Wives and children, with fair, thoughtful faces,"
18972,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Waiting, watching"
18973,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,For a well-known footstep in the passage.
18974,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18975,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Each man's chimney is his Golden Mile-stone;

18978,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,Through the gateways of the world around him.
18979,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,
18980,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,In his farthest wanderings still he sees it;
18981,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Hears the talking flame, the answering night-wind,"
18982,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,As he heard them
18983,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"When he sat with those who were, but are not."

18985,THE GOLDEN MILE-STONE,"Happy he whom neither wealth nor fashion,"

19003,CATAWBA WINE,When the rain begins
19004,CATAWBA WINE,To darken the drear Novembers.

19009,CATAWBA WINE,Nor the Isabel

19019,CATAWBA WINE,
19020,CATAWBA WINE,For richest and best
19021,CATAWBA WINE,"Is the wine of the West,"
19022,CATAWBA WINE,That grows by the Beautiful River;

19025,CATAWBA WINE,With a benison on the giver.

19034,CATAWBA WINE,Very good in its way
19035,CATAWBA WINE,"Is the Verzenay,"
19036,CATAWBA WINE,Or the Sillery soft and creamy;
19037,CATAWBA WINE,But Catawba wine

19048,CATAWBA WINE,Drugged is their juice
19049,CATAWBA WINE,"For foreign use,"
19050,CATAWBA WINE,"When shipped o'er the reeling Atlantic,"
19051,CATAWBA WINE,To rack our brains
19052,CATAWBA WINE,"With the fever pains,"
19053,CATAWBA WINE,That have driven the Old World frantic.
19054,CATAWBA WINE,
19055,CATAWBA WINE,To the sewers and sinks

19058,CATAWBA WINE,For a poison malign
19059,CATAWBA WINE,"Is such Borgia wine,"
19060,CATAWBA WINE,Or at best but a Devil's Elixir.
19061,CATAWBA WINE,
19062,CATAWBA WINE,While pure as a spring
19063,CATAWBA WINE,"Is the wine I sing,"

19577,THE CUMBERLAND,
19578,THE CUMBERLAND,"At anchor in Hampton Roads we lay,"
19579,THE CUMBERLAND,"On board of the cumberland, sloop-of-war;"
19580,THE CUMBERLAND,And at times from the fortress across the bay
19581,THE CUMBERLAND,"The alarum of drums swept past,"
19582,THE CUMBERLAND,Or a bugle blast
19583,THE CUMBERLAND,From the camp on the shore.
19584,THE CUMBERLAND,
19585,THE CUMBERLAND,Then far away to the south uprose
19586,THE CUMBERLAND,"A little feather of snow-white smoke,"
19587,THE CUMBERLAND,And we knew that the iron ship of our foes
19588,THE CUMBERLAND,Was steadily steering its course
19589,THE CUMBERLAND,To try the force
19590,THE CUMBERLAND,Of our ribs of oak.
19591,THE CUMBERLAND,
19592,THE CUMBERLAND,"Down upon us heavily runs,"
19593,THE CUMBERLAND,"Silent and sullen, the floating fort;"
19594,THE CUMBERLAND,"Then comes a puff of smoke from her guns,"
19595,THE CUMBERLAND,"And leaps the terrible death,"
19596,THE CUMBERLAND,"With fiery breath,"
19597,THE CUMBERLAND,From each open port.
19598,THE CUMBERLAND,
19599,THE CUMBERLAND,"We are not idle, but send her straight"
19600,THE CUMBERLAND,Defiance back in a full broadside!
19601,THE CUMBERLAND,"As hail rebounds from a roof of slate,"
19602,THE CUMBERLAND,Rebounds our heavier hail
19603,THE CUMBERLAND,From each iron scale
19604,THE CUMBERLAND,Of the monster's hide.
19605,THE CUMBERLAND,
19606,THE CUMBERLAND,"""Strike your flag!"" the rebel cries,"
19607,THE CUMBERLAND,In his arrogant old plantation strain.
19608,THE CUMBERLAND,"""Never!"" our gallant Morris replies;"
19609,THE CUMBERLAND,"""It is better to sink than to yield!"""
19610,THE CUMBERLAND,And the whole air pealed
19611,THE CUMBERLAND,With the cheers of our men.
19612,THE CUMBERLAND,
19613,THE CUMBERLAND,"Then, like a kraken huge and black,"
19614,THE CUMBERLAND,She crushed our ribs in her iron grasp!
19615,THE CUMBERLAND,"Down went the Cumberland all a wrack,"
19616,THE CUMBERLAND,"With a sudden shudder of death,"
19617,THE CUMBERLAND,And the cannon's breath
19618,THE CUMBERLAND,For her dying gasp.
19619,THE CUMBERLAND,
19620,THE CUMBERLAND,"Next morn, as the sun rose over the bay,"
19621,THE CUMBERLAND,Still floated our flag at the mainmast head.
19622,THE CUMBERLAND,"Lord, how beautiful was Thy day!"
19623,THE CUMBERLAND,Every waft of the air
19624,THE CUMBERLAND,"Was a whisper of prayer,"
19625,THE CUMBERLAND,Or a dirge for the dead.
19626,THE CUMBERLAND,
19627,THE CUMBERLAND,Ho! brave hearts that went down in the seas
19628,THE CUMBERLAND,Ye are at peace in the troubled stream;
19629,THE CUMBERLAND,"Ho! brave land! with hearts like these,"
19630,THE CUMBERLAND,"Thy flag, that is rent in twain,"
19631,THE CUMBERLAND,"Shall be one again,"

19772,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Across the meadows bare and brown,"
19773,THE WAYSIDE INN,The windows of the wayside inn
19774,THE WAYSIDE INN,Gleamed red with fire-light through the leaves
19775,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of woodbine, hanging from the eaves"
19776,THE WAYSIDE INN,Their crimson curtains rent and thin.
19777,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19778,THE WAYSIDE INN,As ancient is this hostelry
19779,THE WAYSIDE INN,"As any in the land may be,"
19780,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Built in the old Colonial day,"
19781,THE WAYSIDE INN,"When men lived in a grander way,"

19783,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A kind of old Hobgoblin Hall,"
19784,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Now somewhat fallen to decay,"
19785,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With weather-stains upon the wall,"

19787,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And creaking and uneven floors,"
19788,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And chimneys huge, and tiled and tall."
19789,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19790,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A region of repose it seems,"
19791,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A place of slumber and of dreams,"
19792,THE WAYSIDE INN,Remote among the wooded hills!
19793,THE WAYSIDE INN,"For there no noisy railway speeds,"
19794,THE WAYSIDE INN,Its torch-race scattering smoke and gleeds;

19805,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Round this old-fashioned, quaint abode"
19806,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Deep silence reigned, save when a gust"

19811,THE WAYSIDE INN,And through the ancient oaks o’erhead

19813,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19814,THE WAYSIDE INN,But from the parlor of the inn
19815,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A pleasant murmur smote the ear,"

19817,THE WAYSIDE INN,Oft interrupted by the din
19818,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of laughter and of loud applause,"
19819,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And, in each intervening pause,"
19820,THE WAYSIDE INN,The music of a violin.
19821,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The fire-light, shedding over all"
19822,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The splendor of its ruddy glow,"
19823,THE WAYSIDE INN,Filled the whole parlor large and low;
19824,THE WAYSIDE INN,"It gleamed on wainscot and on wall,"
19825,THE WAYSIDE INN,It touched with more than wonted grace
19826,THE WAYSIDE INN,Fair Princess Mary’s pictured face;
19827,THE WAYSIDE INN,"It bronzed the rafters overhead,"
19828,THE WAYSIDE INN,On the old spinet’s ivory keys
19829,THE WAYSIDE INN,"It played inaudible melodies,"
19830,THE WAYSIDE INN,"It crowned the sombre clock with flame,"

19832,THE WAYSIDE INN,And painted with a livelier red
19833,THE WAYSIDE INN,The Landlord’s coat-of-arms again;

19835,THE WAYSIDE INN,Emblazoned with its light and shade
19836,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The jovial rhymes, that still remain,"
19837,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Writ near a century ago,"
19838,THE WAYSIDE INN,"By the great Major Molineaux,"
19839,THE WAYSIDE INN,Whom Hawthorne has immortal made.

19841,THE WAYSIDE INN,Before the blazing fire of wood
19842,THE WAYSIDE INN,Erect the rapt musician stood;
19843,THE WAYSIDE INN,And ever and anon he bent
19844,THE WAYSIDE INN,"His head upon his instrument,"
19845,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And seemed to listen, till he caught"
19846,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Confessions of its secret thought,--"
19847,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The joy, the triumph, the lament,"
19848,THE WAYSIDE INN,The exultation and the pain;
19849,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Then, by the magic of his art,"

19852,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19853,THE WAYSIDE INN,Around the fireside at their ease
19854,THE WAYSIDE INN,"There sat a group of friends, entranced"

19856,THE WAYSIDE INN,Who from the far-off noisy town
19857,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Had to the wayside inn come down,"
19858,THE WAYSIDE INN,To rest beneath its old oak-trees.
19859,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The fire-light on their faces glanced,"
19860,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Their shadows on the wainscot danced,"
19861,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And, though of different lands and speech,"
19862,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Each had his tale to tell, and each"
19863,THE WAYSIDE INN,Was anxious to be pleased and please.
19864,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And while the sweet musician plays,"
19865,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Let me in outline sketch them all,"
19866,THE WAYSIDE INN,Perchance uncouthly as the blaze
19867,THE WAYSIDE INN,With its uncertain touch portrays
19868,THE WAYSIDE INN,Their shadowy semblance on the wall.

19870,THE WAYSIDE INN,But first the Landlord will I trace;
19871,THE WAYSIDE INN,Grave in his aspect and attire;
19872,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A man of ancient pedigree,"
19873,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A Justice of the Peace was he,"
19874,THE WAYSIDE INN,Known in all Sudbury as “The Squire.”
19875,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Proud was he of his name and race,"
19876,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of old Sir William and Sir Hugh,"
19877,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And in the parlor, full in view,"
19878,THE WAYSIDE INN,"His coat-of-arms, well framed and glazed,"
19879,THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon the wall in colors blazed;
19880,THE WAYSIDE INN,"He beareth gules upon his shield,"
19881,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A chevron argent in the field,"
19882,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With three wolf’s heads, and for the crest"
19883,THE WAYSIDE INN,A Wyvern part-per-pale addressed
19884,THE WAYSIDE INN,Upon a helmet barred; below
19885,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The scroll reads, “By the name of Howe.”"
19886,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And over this, no longer bright,"
19887,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Though glimmering with a latent light,"
19888,THE WAYSIDE INN,Was hung the sword his grandsire bore
19889,THE WAYSIDE INN,"In the rebellious days of yore,"
19890,THE WAYSIDE INN,Down there at Concord in the fight.
19891,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19892,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A youth was there, of quiet ways,"
19893,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A Student of old books and days,"
19894,THE WAYSIDE INN,To whom all tongues and lands were known
19895,THE WAYSIDE INN,And yet a lover of his own;
19896,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With many a social virtue graced,"
19897,THE WAYSIDE INN,And yet a friend of solitude;
19898,THE WAYSIDE INN,A man of such a genial mood
19899,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The heart of all things he embraced,"
19900,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And yet of such fastidious taste,"
19901,THE WAYSIDE INN,He never found the best too good.
19902,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Books were his passion and delight,"
19903,THE WAYSIDE INN,And in his upper room at home
19904,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Stood many a rare and sumptuous tome,"
19905,THE WAYSIDE INN,"In vellum bound, with gold bedight,"
19906,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Great volumes garmented in white,"
19907,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Recalling Florence, Pisa, Rome."
19908,THE WAYSIDE INN,He loved the twilight that surrounds
19909,THE WAYSIDE INN,The border-land of old romance;
19910,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Where glitter hauberk, helm, and lance,"
19911,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And banner waves, and trumpet sounds,"
19912,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And ladies ride with hawk on wrist,"
19913,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And mighty warriors sweep along,"
19914,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Magnified by the purple mist,"
19915,THE WAYSIDE INN,The dusk of centuries and of song.
19916,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The chronicles of Charlemagne,"
19917,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of Merlin and the Mort d’Arthure,"
19918,THE WAYSIDE INN,Mingled together in his brain
19919,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With tales of Flores and Blanchefleur,"
19920,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Sir Ferumbras, Sir Eglamour,"
19921,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Sir Launcelot, Sir Morgadour,"
19922,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Sir Guy, Sir Bevis, Sir Gawain."
19923,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19924,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A young Sicilian, too, was there;"
19925,THE WAYSIDE INN,"In sight of Etna born and bred,"
19926,THE WAYSIDE INN,Some breath of its volcanic air
19927,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Was glowing in his heart and brain,"
19928,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And, being rebellious to his liege,"
19929,THE WAYSIDE INN,"After Palermo’s fatal siege,"
19930,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Across the western seas he fled,"
19931,THE WAYSIDE INN,In good King Bomba’s happy reign.
19932,THE WAYSIDE INN,"His face was like a summer night,"
19933,THE WAYSIDE INN,All flooded with a dusky light;
19934,THE WAYSIDE INN,His hands were small; his teeth shone white
19935,THE WAYSIDE INN,"As sea-shells, when he smiled or spoke;"
19936,THE WAYSIDE INN,His sinews supple and strong as oak;
19937,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Clean shaven was he as a priest,"
19938,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Who at the mass on Sunday sings,"
19939,THE WAYSIDE INN,Save that upon his upper lip
19940,THE WAYSIDE INN,"His beard, a good palm’s length least,"
19941,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Level and pointed at the tip,"
19942,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Shot sideways, like a swallow’s wings."
19943,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The poets read he o’er and o’er,"
19944,THE WAYSIDE INN,And most of all the Immortal Four
19945,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of Italy; and next to those,"
19946,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The story-telling bard of prose,"
19947,THE WAYSIDE INN,Who wrote the joyous Tuscan tales
19948,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of the Decameron, that make"
19949,THE WAYSIDE INN,Fiesole’s green hills and vales
19950,THE WAYSIDE INN,Remembered for Boccaccio’s sake.
19951,THE WAYSIDE INN,Much too of music was his thought;
19952,THE WAYSIDE INN,The melodies and measures fraught
19953,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With sunshine and the open air,"
19954,THE WAYSIDE INN,Of vineyards and the singing sea
19955,THE WAYSIDE INN,Of his beloved Sicily;
19956,THE WAYSIDE INN,And much it pleased him to peruse
19957,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The songs of the Sicilian muse,--"
19958,THE WAYSIDE INN,Bucolic songs by Meli sung
19959,THE WAYSIDE INN,"In the familiar peasant tongue,"
19960,THE WAYSIDE INN,"That made men say, “Behold! once more"
19961,THE WAYSIDE INN,The pitying gods to earth restore
19962,THE WAYSIDE INN,Theocritus of Syracuse!”
19963,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19964,THE WAYSIDE INN,A Spanish Jew from Alicant
19965,THE WAYSIDE INN,With aspect grand and grave was there;
19966,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Vender of silks and fabrics rare,"
19967,THE WAYSIDE INN,And attar of rose from the Levant.
19968,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Like an old Patriarch he appeared,"
19969,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Abraham or Isaac, or at least"
19970,THE WAYSIDE INN,Some later Prophet or High-Priest;
19971,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With lustrous eyes, and olive skin,"
19972,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And, wildly tossed from cheeks and chin,"
19973,THE WAYSIDE INN,The tumbling cataract of his beard.
19974,THE WAYSIDE INN,His garments breathed a spicy scent
19975,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of cinnamon and sandal blent,"
19976,THE WAYSIDE INN,Like the soft aromatic gales
19977,THE WAYSIDE INN,"That meet the mariner, who sails"
19978,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Through the Moluccas, and the seas"
19979,THE WAYSIDE INN,That wash the shores of Celebes.
19980,THE WAYSIDE INN,All stories that recorded are
19981,THE WAYSIDE INN,"By Pierre Alphonse he knew by heart,"
19982,THE WAYSIDE INN,And it was rumored he could say
19983,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The Parables of Sandabar,"
19984,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And all the Fables of Pilpay,"
19985,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Or if not all, the greater part!"
19986,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Well versed was he in Hebrew books,"
19987,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Talmud and Targum, and the lore"
19988,THE WAYSIDE INN,Of Kabala; and evermore
19989,THE WAYSIDE INN,There was a mystery in his looks;
19990,THE WAYSIDE INN,"His eyes seemed gazing far away,"
19991,THE WAYSIDE INN,As if in vision or in trance
19992,THE WAYSIDE INN,"He heard the solemn sackbut play,"
19993,THE WAYSIDE INN,And saw the Jewish maidens dance.
19994,THE WAYSIDE INN,
19995,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A Theologian, from the school"
19996,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of Cambridge on the Charles, was there;"
19997,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Skilful alike with tongue and pen,"
19998,THE WAYSIDE INN,He preached to all men everywhere
19999,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The Gospel of the Golden Rule,"
20000,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The New Commandment given to men,"
20001,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Thinking the deed, and not the creed,"
20002,THE WAYSIDE INN,Would help us in our utmost need.
20003,THE WAYSIDE INN,"With reverent feet the earth he trod,"
20004,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Nor banished nature from his plan,"
20005,THE WAYSIDE INN,But studied still with deep research
20006,THE WAYSIDE INN,"To build the Universal Church,"
20007,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Lofty as in the love of God,"
20008,THE WAYSIDE INN,And ample as the wants of man.
20009,THE WAYSIDE INN,
20010,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A Poet, too, was there, whose verse"
20011,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Was tender, musical, and terse;"
20012,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The inspiration, the delight,"
20013,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The gleam, the glory, the swift flight,"
20014,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Of thoughts so sudden, that they seem"
20015,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The revelations of a dream,"
20016,THE WAYSIDE INN,All these were his; but with them came
20017,THE WAYSIDE INN,No envy of another’s fame;
20018,THE WAYSIDE INN,He did not find his sleep less sweet
20019,THE WAYSIDE INN,"For music in some neighboring street,"
20020,THE WAYSIDE INN,Nor rustling hear in every breeze
20021,THE WAYSIDE INN,The laurels of Miltiades.
20022,THE WAYSIDE INN,Honor and blessings on his head
20023,THE WAYSIDE INN,"While living, good report when dead,"
20024,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Who, not too eager for renown,"
20025,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Accepts, but does not clutch, the crown!"
20026,THE WAYSIDE INN,
20027,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Last the Musician, as he stood"
20028,THE WAYSIDE INN,Illumined by that fire of wood;
20029,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Fair-haired, blue-eyed, his aspect blithe."
20030,THE WAYSIDE INN,"His figure tall and straight and lithe,"
20031,THE WAYSIDE INN,And every feature of his face
20032,THE WAYSIDE INN,Revealing his Norwegian race;
20033,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A radiance, streaming from within,"
20034,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Around his eyes and forehead beamed,"
20035,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The Angel with the violin,"
20036,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Painted by Raphael, he seemed."
20037,THE WAYSIDE INN,He lived in that ideal world
20038,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Whose language is not speech, but song;"
20039,THE WAYSIDE INN,Around him evermore the throng
20040,THE WAYSIDE INN,Of elves and sprites their dances whirled;
20041,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The Stromkarl sang, the cataract hurled"
20042,THE WAYSIDE INN,Its headlong waters from the height;
20043,THE WAYSIDE INN,And mingled in the wild delight
20044,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The scream of sea-birds in their flight,"
20045,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The rumor of the forest trees,"
20046,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The plunge of the implacable seas,"
20047,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The tumult of the wind at night,"
20048,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Voices of eld, like trumpets blowing,"
20049,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Old ballads, and wild melodies"
20050,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Through mist and darkness pouring forth,"
20051,THE WAYSIDE INN,Like Elivagar’s river flowing
20052,THE WAYSIDE INN,Out of the glaciers of the North.
20053,THE WAYSIDE INN,
20054,THE WAYSIDE INN,The instrument on which he played
20055,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Was in Cremona’s workshops made,"
20056,THE WAYSIDE INN,"By a great master of the past,"
20057,THE WAYSIDE INN,Ere yet was lost the art divine;
20058,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Fashioned of maple and of pine,"
20059,THE WAYSIDE INN,That in Tyrolian forests vast
20060,THE WAYSIDE INN,Had rocked and wrestled with the blast;
20061,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Exquisite was it in design,"
20062,THE WAYSIDE INN,Perfect in each minutest part.
20063,THE WAYSIDE INN,A marvel of the lutist’s art;
20064,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And in its hollow chamber, thus,"
20065,THE WAYSIDE INN,The maker from whose hands it came
20066,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Had written his unrivalled name,--"
20067,THE WAYSIDE INN,“Antonius Stradivarius.”
20068,THE WAYSIDE INN,
20069,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And when he played, the atmosphere"
20070,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Was filled with magic, and the ear"
20071,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Caught echoes of that Harp of Gold,"
20072,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Whose music had so weird a sound,"
20073,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The hunted stag forgot to bound,"
20074,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The leaping rivulet backward rolled,"
20075,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The birds came down from bush and tree,"
20076,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The dead came from beneath the sea,"
20077,THE WAYSIDE INN,The maiden to the harper’s knee!
20078,THE WAYSIDE INN,
20079,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The music ceased; the applause was loud,"
20080,THE WAYSIDE INN,The pleased musician smiled and bowed;
20081,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The wood-fire clapped its hands of flame,"
20082,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The shadows on the wainscot stirred,"
20083,THE WAYSIDE INN,And from the harpsichord there came
20084,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A ghostly murmur of acclaim,"
20085,THE WAYSIDE INN,A sound like that sent down at night
20086,THE WAYSIDE INN,"By birds of passage in their flight,"
20087,THE WAYSIDE INN,From the remotest distance heard.
20088,THE WAYSIDE INN,
20089,THE WAYSIDE INN,Then silence followed; then began
20090,THE WAYSIDE INN,"A clamor for the Landlord’s tale,--"
20091,THE WAYSIDE INN,"The story promised them of old,"
20092,THE WAYSIDE INN,"They said, but always left untold;"
20093,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And he, although a bashful man,"
20094,THE WAYSIDE INN,"And all his courage seemed to fail,"
20095,THE WAYSIDE INN,"Finding excuse of no avail,"
20096,THE WAYSIDE INN,Yielded; and thus the story ran.

20105,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Listen, my children, and you shall hear"
20106,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,"

20108,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Hardly a man is now alive
20109,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Who remembers that famous day and year.
20110,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20111,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"He said to his friend, “If the British march"
20112,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"By land or sea from the town to-night,"
20113,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch
20114,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Of the North Church tower as a signal light,—"
20115,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"One, if by land, and two, if by sea;"
20116,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And I on the opposite shore will be,"
20117,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Ready to ride and spread the alarm
20118,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Through every Middlesex village and farm
20119,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"For the country folk to be up and to arm,”"
20120,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20121,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Then he said, “Good night!” and with muffled oar"
20122,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,"
20123,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Just as the moon rose over the bay,"
20124,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
20125,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"The Somerset, British man-of-war;"
20126,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A phantom ship, with each mast and spar"
20127,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Across the moon like a prison bar,"

20129,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,By its own reflection in the tide.
20130,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20131,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street,"
20132,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Wanders and watches with eager ears,"
20133,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Till in the silence around him he hears
20134,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"The muster of men at the barrack door,"
20135,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,"
20136,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And the measured tread of the grenadiers,"
20137,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Marching down to their boats on the shore.
20138,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20139,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,"
20140,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,"
20141,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"To the belfry-chamber overhead,"
20142,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And startled the pigeons from their perch
20143,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"On the sombre rafters, that round him made"
20144,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Masses and moving shapes of shade,—"
20145,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"By the trembling ladder, steep and tall"
20146,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"To the highest window in the wall,"
20147,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Where he paused to listen and look down
20148,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A moment on the roofs of the town,"
20149,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And the moonlight flowing over all.
20150,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20151,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,"
20152,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"In their night-encampment on the hill,"
20153,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Wrapped in silence so deep and still
20154,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"That he could hear, like a sentinel’s tread,"
20155,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"The watchful night-wind, as it went"
20156,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Creeping along from tent to tent
20157,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”"
20158,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,A moment only he feels the spell
20159,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread"
20160,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
20161,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
20162,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"On a shadowy something far away,"
20163,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Where the river widens to meet the bay,—"
20164,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,A line of black that bends and floats
20165,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats."
20166,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20167,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,"
20168,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride"
20169,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
20170,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Now he patted his horse’s side,"
20171,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Now gazed at the landscape far and near,"
20172,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,"
20173,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
20174,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,But mostly he watched with eager search
20175,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,"
20176,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"As it rose above the graves on the hill,"
20177,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
20178,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And lo! as he looks, on the belfry’s height"
20179,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!"
20180,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,"
20181,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight"
20182,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,A second lamp in the belfry burns!
20183,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20184,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A hurry of hoofs in a village street,"
20185,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,"
20186,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark"
20187,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
20188,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,"
20189,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,The fate of a nation was riding that night;
20190,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,"
20191,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
20192,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"He has left the village and mounted the steep,"
20193,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,"
20194,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;"
20195,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And under the alders, that skirt its edge,"
20196,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,"
20197,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.
20198,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20199,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,It was twelve by the village clock
20200,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
20201,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"He heard the crowing of the cock,"
20202,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And the barking of the farmer’s dog,"
20203,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And felt the damp of the river fog,"
20204,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,That rises after the sun goes down.
20205,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20206,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"It was one by the village clock,"
20207,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,When he galloped into Lexington.
20208,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,He saw the gilded weathercock
20209,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Swim in the moonlight as he passed,"
20210,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,"
20211,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Gaze at him with a spectral glare,"
20212,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,As if they already stood aghast
20213,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,At the bloody work they would look upon.
20214,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20215,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"It was two by the village clock,"
20216,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
20217,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"He heard the bleating of the flock,"
20218,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"And the twitter of birds among the trees,"
20219,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And felt the breath of the morning breeze
20220,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Blowing over the meadows brown.
20221,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And one was safe and asleep in his bed
20222,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Who at the bridge would be first to fall,"
20223,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Who that day would be lying dead,"
20224,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Pierced by a British musket-ball.
20225,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20226,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"You know the rest. In the books you have read,"
20227,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"How the British Regulars fired and fled,—"
20228,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"How the farmers gave them ball for ball,"
20229,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,"
20230,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Chasing the red-coats down the lane,"
20231,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,Then crossing the fields to emerge again
20232,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Under the trees at the turn of the road,"
20233,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And only pausing to fire and load.
20234,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,
20235,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,So through the night rode Paul Revere;
20236,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And so through the night went his cry of alarm
20237,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"To every Middlesex village and farm,—"
20238,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A cry of defiance and not of fear,"
20239,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,"
20240,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,And a word that shall echo forevermore!
20241,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,"
20242,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"Through all our history, to the last,"
20243,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"In the hour of darkness and peril and need,"
20244,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,The people will waken and listen to hear
20245,PAUL REVERE’S RIDE.,"The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,"

20254,INTERLUDE.,Then rising took down from its nail
20255,INTERLUDE.,"The sword that hung there, dim with dust"
20256,INTERLUDE.,"And cleaving to its sheath with rust,"
20257,INTERLUDE.,"And said, “This sword was in the fight.”"
20258,INTERLUDE.,"The Poet seized it, and exclaimed,"
20259,INTERLUDE.,"“It is the sword of a good knight,"
20260,INTERLUDE.,Though homespun was his coat-of-mail;
20261,INTERLUDE.,What matter if it be not named
20262,INTERLUDE.,"Joyeuse, Colada, Durindale,"

20271,INTERLUDE.,Clinking about in foreign lands
20272,INTERLUDE.,"With iron gauntlets on his hands,"
20273,INTERLUDE.,And on his head an iron pot!”
20274,INTERLUDE.,
20275,INTERLUDE.,All laughed; the Landlord’s face grew red
20276,INTERLUDE.,As his escutcheon on the wall;
20277,INTERLUDE.,He could not comprehend at all
20278,INTERLUDE.,The drift of what the Poet said;
20279,INTERLUDE.,For those who had been longest dead
20280,INTERLUDE.,Were always greatest in his eyes;
20281,INTERLUDE.,And he was speechless with surprise
20282,INTERLUDE.,To see Sir William’s plumed head
20283,INTERLUDE.,"Brought to a level with the rest,"
20284,INTERLUDE.,And made the subject of a jest.
20285,INTERLUDE.,"And this perceiving, to appease"
20286,INTERLUDE.,"The Landlord’s wrath, the others’ fears,"
20287,INTERLUDE.,"The Student said, with careless ease,"
20288,INTERLUDE.,"“The ladies and the cavaliers,"
20289,INTERLUDE.,"The arms, the loves, the courtesies,"
20290,INTERLUDE.,"The deeds of high emprise, I sing!"
20291,INTERLUDE.,"Thus Ariosto says, in words"

20293,INTERLUDE.,Of armed knights and clashing swords.
20294,INTERLUDE.,Now listen to the tale I bring
20295,INTERLUDE.,Listen! though not to me belong
20296,INTERLUDE.,"The flowing draperies of his song,"
20297,INTERLUDE.,"The words that rouse, the voice that charms."
20298,INTERLUDE.,"The Landlord’s tale was one of arms,"
20299,INTERLUDE.,"Only a tale of love is mine,"
20300,INTERLUDE.,"Blending the human and divine,"
20301,INTERLUDE.,"A tale of the Decameron, told"

20303,INTERLUDE.,"By Fiametta, laurel-crowned,"
20304,INTERLUDE.,"While her companions lay around,"

20321,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Weary with labor in his garden-plot,"
20322,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"On a rude bench beneath his cottage eaves,"
20323,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Ser Federigo sat among the leaves
20324,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Of a huge vine, that, with its arms outspread,"
20325,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Hung its delicious clusters overhead.
20326,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Below him, through the lovely valley flowed"
20327,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The river Arno, like a winding road,"
20328,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And from its banks were lifted high in air
20329,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The spires and roofs of Florence called the Fair;
20330,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"To him a marble tomb, that rose above"
20331,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,His wasted fortunes and his buried love.
20332,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"For there, in banquet and in tournament,"
20333,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"His wealth had lavished been, his substance spent,"
20334,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"To woo and lose, since ill his wooing sped,"
20335,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Monna Giovanna, who his rival wed,"
20336,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Yet ever in his fancy reigned supreme,"
20337,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The ideal woman of a young man’s dream.
20338,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20339,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then he withdrew, in poverty and pain,"
20340,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"To this small farm, the last of his domain,"
20341,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,His only comfort and his only care
20342,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"To prune his vines, and plant the fig and pear;"
20343,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,His only forester and only guest
20344,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"His falcon, faithful to him, when the rest,"
20345,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Whose willing hands had found so light of yore
20346,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The brazen knocker of his palace door,"
20347,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Had now no strength to lift the wooden latch,"
20348,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,That entrance gave beneath a roof of thatch.
20349,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Companion of his solitary ways,"
20350,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Purveyor of his feasts on holidays,"
20351,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,On him this melancholy man bestowed
20352,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The love with which his nature overflowed.
20353,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20354,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And so the empty-handed years went round,"
20355,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Vacant, though voiceful with prophetic sound,"
20356,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And so, that summer morn, he sat and mused"
20357,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"With folded, patient hands, as he was used,"
20358,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And dreamily before his half-closed sight
20359,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Floated the vision of his lost delight.
20360,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Beside him, motionless, the drowsy bird"
20361,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Dreamed of the chase, and in his slumber heard"
20362,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The sudden, scythe-like sweep of wings, that dare"
20363,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The headlong plunge thro’ eddying gulfs of air,"
20364,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then, starting broad awake upon his perch,"
20365,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Tinkled his bells, like mass-bells in a church,"
20366,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And, looking at his master, seemed to say,"
20367,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“Ser Federigo, shall we hunt to-day?”"
20368,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20369,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Ser Federigo thought not of the chase;
20370,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The tender vision of her lovely face,"
20371,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"I will not say he seems to see, he sees"
20372,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"In the leaf-shadows of the trellises,"
20373,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Herself, yet not herself; a lovely child"
20374,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"With flowing tresses, and eyes wide and wild,"
20375,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Coming undaunted up the garden walk,"
20376,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And looking not at him, but at the hawk."
20377,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“Beautiful falcon!” said he, “would that I"
20378,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Might hold thee on my wrist, or see thee fly!”"
20379,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The voice was hers, and made strange echoes start"
20380,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Through all the haunted chambers of his heart,"
20381,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,As an æolian harp through gusty doors
20382,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Of some old ruin its wild music pours.
20383,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20384,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“Who is thy mother, my fair boy?” he said,"
20385,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,His hand laid softly on that shining head.
20386,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,“Monna Giovanna. Will you let me stay
20387,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"A little while, and with your falcon play?"
20388,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"We live there, just beyond your garden wall,"
20389,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,In the great house behind the poplars tall.”
20390,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20391,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,So he spake on; and Federigo heard
20392,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"As from afar each softly uttered word,"
20393,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And drifted onward through the golden gleams
20394,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And shadows of the misty sea of dreams,"
20395,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"As mariners becalmed through vapors drift,"
20396,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And feel the sea beneath them sink and lift,"
20397,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And hear far off the mournful breakers roar,"
20398,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And voices calling faintly from the shore!
20399,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then, waking from his pleasant reveries"
20400,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"He took the little boy upon his knees,"
20401,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And told him stories of his gallant bird,"
20402,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Till in their friendship he became a third.
20403,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20404,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Monna Giovanna, widowed in her prime,"
20405,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Had come with friends to pass the summer time
20406,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"In her grand villa, half-way up the hill,"
20407,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"O’erlooking Florence, but retired and still;"
20408,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"With iron gates, that opened through long lines"
20409,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Of sacred ilex and centennial pines,"
20410,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And terraced gardens, and broad steps of stone,"
20411,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And sylvan deities, with moss o’ergrown,"
20412,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And fountains palpitating in the heat,"
20413,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And all Val d’Arno stretched beneath its feet.
20414,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Here in seclusion, as a widow may,"
20415,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The lovely lady whiled the hours away,"
20416,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Pacing in sable robes the statued hall,"
20417,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Herself the stateliest statue among all,"
20418,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And seeing more and more, with secret joy,"
20419,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Her husband risen and living in her boy,"
20420,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Till the lost sense of life returned again,"
20421,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Not as delight, but as relief from pain."
20422,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Meanwhile the boy, rejoicing in his strength,"
20423,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Stormed down the terraces from length to length;
20424,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The screaming peacock chased in hot pursuit,"
20425,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And climbed the garden trellises for fruit.
20426,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,But his chief pastime was to watch the flight
20427,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Of a gerfalcon, soaring into sight,"
20428,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Beyond the trees that fringed the garden wall,"
20429,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Then downward stooping at some distant call;
20430,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And as he gazed full often wondered he
20431,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Who might the master of the falcon be,"
20432,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Until that happy morning, when he found"
20433,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Master and falcon in the cottage ground.
20434,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20435,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And now a shadow and a terror fell
20436,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"On the great house, as if a passing-bell"
20437,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Tolled from the tower, and filled each spacious room"
20438,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"With secret awe, and preternatural gloom;"
20439,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The petted boy grew ill, and day by day"
20440,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Pined with mysterious malady away.
20441,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The mother’s heart would not be comforted;
20442,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Her darling seemed to her already dead,"
20443,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And often, sitting by the sufferer’s side,"
20444,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,“What can I do to comfort thee?” she cried.
20445,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"At first the silent lips made no reply,"
20446,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"But moved at length by her importunate cry,"
20447,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“Give me,” he answered, with imploring tone,"
20448,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,“Ser Federigo’s falcon for my own!”
20449,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,No answer could the astonished mother make;
20450,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"How could she ask, e’en for her darling’s sake,"
20451,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Such favor at a luckless lover’s hand,"
20452,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Well knowing that to ask was to command?
20453,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Well knowing, what all falconers confessed,"
20454,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"In all the land that falcon was the best,"
20455,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The master’s pride and passion and delight,"
20456,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And the sole pursuivant of this poor knight.
20457,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"But yet, for her child’s sake, she could no less"
20458,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Than give assent to soothe his restlessness,"
20459,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"So promised, and then promising to keep"
20460,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Her promise sacred, saw him fall asleep."
20461,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20462,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The morrow was a bright September morn;
20463,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The earth was beautiful as if new-born;
20464,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"There was that nameless splendor everywhere,"
20465,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"That wild exhilaration in the air,"
20466,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Which makes the passers in the city street
20467,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Congratulate each other as they meet.
20468,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Two lovely ladies, clothed in cloak and hood,"
20469,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Passed through the garden gate into the wood,"
20470,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Under the lustrous leaves, and through the sheen"
20471,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Of dewy sunshine showering down between.
20472,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20473,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The one, close-hooded, had the attractive grace"
20474,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Which sorrow sometimes lends a woman’s face;
20475,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Her dark eyes moistened with the mists that roll
20476,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,From the gulf-stream of passion in the soul;
20477,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The other with her hood thrown back, her hair"
20478,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Making a golden glory in the air,"
20479,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Her cheeks suffused with an auroral blush,"
20480,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Her young heart singing louder than the thrush.
20481,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"So walked, that morn, through mingled light and shade,"
20482,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Each by the other’s presence lovelier made,"
20483,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Monna Giovanna and her bosom friend,"
20484,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Intent upon their errand and its end.
20485,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20486,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"They found Ser Federigo at his toil,"
20487,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Like banished Adam, delving in the soil;"
20488,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And when he looked and these fair women spied,"
20489,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The garden suddenly was glorified;
20490,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"His long-lost Eden was restored again,"
20491,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And the strange river winding through the plain
20492,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"No longer was the Arno to his eyes,"
20493,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,But the Euphrates watering Paradise!
20494,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20495,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Monna Giovanna raised her stately head,"
20496,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And with fair words of salutation said:
20497,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“Ser Federigo, we come here as friends,"
20498,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Hoping in this to make some poor amends
20499,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,For past unkindness. I who ne’er before
20500,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Would even cross the threshold of your door,"
20501,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"I who in happier days such pride maintained,"
20502,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Refused your banquets, and your gifts disdained,"
20503,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"This morning come, a self-invited guest,"
20504,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"To put your generous nature to the test,"
20505,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And breakfast with you under your own vine.”
20506,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"To which he answered: “Poor desert of mine,"
20507,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Not your unkindness call it, for if aught"
20508,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Is good in me of feeling or of thought,"
20509,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"From you it comes, and this last grace outweighs"
20510,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"All sorrows, all regrets of other days.”"
20511,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20512,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And after further compliment and talk,"
20513,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Among the asters in the garden walk
20514,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"He left his guests; and to his cottage turned,"
20515,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And as he entered for a moment yearned
20516,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"For the lost splendors of the days of old,"
20517,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The ruby glass, the silver and the gold,"
20518,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And felt how piercing is the sting of pride,"
20519,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,By want embittered and intensified.
20520,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,He looked about him for some means or way
20521,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,To keep this unexpected holiday;
20522,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Searched every cupboard, and then searched again,"
20523,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Summoned the maid, who came, but came in vain;"
20524,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“The Signor did not hunt to-day,” she said,"
20525,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,“There’s nothing in the house but wine and bread.”
20526,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20527,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Then suddenly the drowsy falcon shook
20528,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"His little bells, with that sagacious look,"
20529,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Which said, as plain as language to the ear,"
20530,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“If anything is wanting, I am here!”"
20531,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Yes, everything is wanting, gallant bird!"
20532,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The master seized thee without further word.
20533,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Like thine own lure, he whirled thee round; ah me!"
20534,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The pomp and flutter of brave falconry,"
20535,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The bells, the jesses, the bright scarlet hood,"
20536,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The flight and the pursuit o’er field and wood,"
20537,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,All these forevermore are ended now;
20538,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"No longer victor, but the victim thou!"
20539,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20540,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then on the board a snow-white cloth he spread,"
20541,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Laid on its wooden dish the loaf of bread,"
20542,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Brought purple grapes with autumn sunshine hot,"
20543,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The fragrant peach, the juicy bergamot;"
20544,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then in the midst a flask of wine he placed,"
20545,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And with autumnal flowers the banquet graced.
20546,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Ser Federigo, would not these suffice"
20547,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Without thy falcon stuffed with cloves and spice?
20548,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20549,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"When all was ready, and the courtly dame"
20550,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"With her companion to the cottage came,"
20551,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Upon Ser Federigo’s brain there fell
20552,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The wild enchantment of a magic spell!
20553,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The room they entered, mean and low and small,"
20554,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Was changed into a sumptuous banquet-hall,"
20555,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,With fanfares by aerial trumpets blown;
20556,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,The rustic chair she sat on was a throne;
20557,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"He ate celestial food, and a divine"
20558,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Flavor was given to his country wine,"
20559,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And the poor falcon, fragrant with his spice,"
20560,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"A peacock was, or bird of paradise!"
20561,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20562,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"When the repast was ended, they arose"
20563,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And passed again into the garden-close.
20564,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then said the lady, “Far too well I know"
20565,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Remembering still the days of long ago,"
20566,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Though you betray it not with what surprise
20567,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,You see me here in this familiar wise.
20568,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"You have no children, and you cannot guess"
20569,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"What anguish, what unspeakable distress"
20570,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"A mother feels, whose child is lying ill,"
20571,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Nor how her heart anticipates his will.
20572,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And yet for this, you see me lay aside"
20573,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"All womanly reserve and check of pride,"
20574,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And ask the thing most precious in your sight,"
20575,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Your falcon, your sole comfort and delight,"
20576,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Which if you find it in your heart to give,"
20577,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"My poor, unhappy boy perchance may live.”"
20578,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20579,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Ser Federigo listens, and replies,"
20580,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,With tears of love and pity in his eyes:
20581,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"“Alas, dear lady! there can be no task"
20582,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"So sweet to me, as giving when you ask."
20583,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"One little hour ago, if I had known"
20584,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"This wish of yours, it would have been my own."
20585,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,But thinking in what manner I could best
20586,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Do honor to the presence of my guest,"
20587,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,I deemed that nothing worthier could be
20588,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Than what most dear and precious was to me,"
20589,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,And so my gallant falcon breathed his last
20590,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,To furnish forth this morning our repast.”
20591,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20592,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"In mute contrition, mingled with dismay,"
20593,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The gentle lady tuned her eyes away,"
20594,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Grieving that he such sacrifice should make,"
20595,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And kill his falcon for a woman’s sake,"
20596,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Yet feeling in her heart a woman’s pride,"
20597,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,That nothing she could ask for was denied;
20598,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Then took her leave, and passed out at the gate"
20599,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,With footstep slow and soul disconsolate.
20600,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20601,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Three days went by, and lo! a passing-bell"
20602,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Tolled from the little chapel in the dell;
20603,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Ten strokes Ser Federigo heard, and said,"
20604,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Breathing a prayer, “Alas! her child is dead!”"
20605,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Three months went by; and lo! a merrier chime
20606,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,Rang from the chapel bells at Christmas time;
20607,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The cottage was deserted, and no more"
20608,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Ser Federigo sat beside its door,"
20609,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"But now, with servitors to do his will,"
20610,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"In the grand villa, half-way up the hill,"
20611,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Sat at the Christmas feast, and at his side"
20612,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Monna Giovanna, his beloved bride,"
20613,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Never so beautiful, so kind, so fair,"
20614,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"Enthroned once more in the old rustic chair,"
20615,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,High-perched upon the back of which there stood
20616,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"The image of a falcon carved in wood,"
20617,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,"And underneath the inscription, with date,"
20618,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,“All things come round to him who will but wait.”
20619,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,
20620,THE FALCON OF SER FEDERIGO,

20626,INTERLUDE,"Soon as the story reached its end,"
20627,INTERLUDE,"One, over eager to commend,"
20628,INTERLUDE,Crowned it with injudicious praise;
20629,INTERLUDE,"And then the voice of blame found vent,"
20630,INTERLUDE,And fanned the embers of dissent
20631,INTERLUDE,Into a somewhat lively blaze.
20632,INTERLUDE,
20633,INTERLUDE,The Theologian shook his head;
20634,INTERLUDE,"""These old Italian tales,"" he said,"
20635,INTERLUDE,"""From the much-praised Decameron down"
20636,INTERLUDE,"Through all the rabble of the rest,"
20637,INTERLUDE,"Are either trifling, dull, or lewd;"
20638,INTERLUDE,The gossip of a neighborhood
20639,INTERLUDE,"In some remote provincial town,"
20640,INTERLUDE,A scandalous chronicle at best!
20641,INTERLUDE,"They seem to me a stagnant fen,"
20642,INTERLUDE,"Grown rank with rushes and with reeds,"
20643,INTERLUDE,"Where a white lily, now and then,"
20644,INTERLUDE,Blooms in the midst of noxious weeds
20645,INTERLUDE,"And deadly nightshade on its banks."""
20646,INTERLUDE,
20647,INTERLUDE,"To this the Student straight replied,"
20648,INTERLUDE,"""For the white lily, many thanks!"
20649,INTERLUDE,"One should not say, with too much pride,"
20650,INTERLUDE,"Fountain, I will not drink of thee!"
20651,INTERLUDE,"Nor were it grateful to forget,"
20652,INTERLUDE,That from these reservoirs and tanks
20653,INTERLUDE,Even imperial Shakespeare drew
20654,INTERLUDE,"His Moor of Venice, and the Jew,"
20655,INTERLUDE,"And Romeo and Juliet,"
20656,INTERLUDE,"And many a famous comedy."""
20657,INTERLUDE,
20658,INTERLUDE,"Then a long pause; till some one said,"
20659,INTERLUDE,"""An Angel is flying overhead!"""
20660,INTERLUDE,"At these words spake the Spanish Jew,"
20661,INTERLUDE,And murmured with an inward breath:
20662,INTERLUDE,"""God grant, if what you say be true,"
20663,INTERLUDE,"It may not be the Angel of Death!"""
20664,INTERLUDE,"And then another pause; and then,"
20665,INTERLUDE,"Stroking his beard, he said again:"
20666,INTERLUDE,"""This brings back to my memory"
20667,INTERLUDE,"A story in the Talmud told,"

20688,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,
20689,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Then fell a sudden shadow on the page,"

20691,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"He saw the Angel of Death before him stand,"

20693,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Rabbi Ben Levi was a righteous man,"
20694,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,Yet through his veins a chill of terror ran.
20695,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"With trembling voice he said, “What wilt thou here?”"
20696,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"The angel answered, “Lo! the time draws near"
20697,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"When thou must die; yet first, by God’s decree,"

20703,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Rabbi Ben Levi closed the sacred book,"
20704,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"And rising, and uplifting his gray head,"
20705,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"“Give me thy sword,” he to the Angel said,"
20706,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,“Lest thou shouldst fall upon me by the way.”
20707,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"The angel smiled and hastened to obey,"
20708,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Then led him forth to the Celestial Town,"
20709,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"And set him on the wall, whence, gazing down,"
20710,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Rabbi Ben Levi, with his living eyes,"
20711,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,Might look upon his place in Paradise.
20712,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,
20713,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,Then straight into the city of the Lord
20714,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"The Rabbi leaped with the Death-Angel’s sword,"
20715,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,And through the streets there swept a sudden breath
20716,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Of something there unknown, which men call death."
20717,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Meanwhile the Angel stayed without and cried,"
20718,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"“Come back!” To which the Rabbi’s voice replied,"
20719,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"“No! in the name of God, whom I adore,"

20731,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,Beyond the outer wall the Angel of Death

20734,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Whereat the Rabbi paused, and answered, “Nay!"

20737,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,He heard the awful mandate of the Lord
20738,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,"Resounding through the air, “Give back the sword!”"
20739,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,
20740,THE LEGEND OF RABBI BEN LEVI,The Rabbi bowed his head in silent prayer;

20770,INTERLUDE,"At last, but in a voice subdued,"

20790,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
20791,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Apparelled in magnificent attire,"
20792,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With retinue of many a knight and squire,"
20793,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"On St. John’s eve, at vespers, proudly sat"
20794,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And heard the priests chant the Magnificat,"
20795,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And as he listened, o’er and o’er again"
20796,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Repeated, like a burden or refrain,"
20797,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He caught the words, “Deposuit potentes"
20798,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"De sede, et exaltavit humiles;”"
20799,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And slowly lifting up his kingly head
20800,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He to a learned clerk beside him said,"
20801,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“What mean these words?” The clerk made answer meet,"
20802,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“He has put down the mighty from their seat,"

20804,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,"
20805,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,“’T is well that such seditious words are sung
20806,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;
20807,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"For unto priests and people be it known,"
20808,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,There is no power can push me from my throne!”
20809,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,"
20810,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.
20811,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20812,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"When he awoke, it was already night;"
20813,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The church was empty, and there was no light,"
20814,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,"
20815,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Lighted a little space before some saint.
20816,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He started from his seat and gazed around,"
20817,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,But saw no living thing and heard no sound.
20818,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He groped towards the door, but it was locked;"
20819,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,"
20820,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,"
20821,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And imprecations upon men and saints.
20822,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,The sounds re-echoed from the roof and walls
20823,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls.
20824,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20825,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"At length the sexton, hearing from without"
20826,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The tumult of the knocking and the shout,"
20827,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,"
20828,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Came with his lantern, asking, “Who is there?”"
20829,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,"
20830,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“Open: ’tis I, the King! Art thou afraid?”"
20831,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,"
20832,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!”"
20833,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;
20834,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A man rushed by him at a single stride,"
20835,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,"
20836,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke,"
20837,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"But leaped into the blackness of the night,"
20838,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And vanished like a spectre from his sight.
20839,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20840,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane"
20841,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"

20844,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,"
20845,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;
20846,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Rushed through the courtyard, thrusting in his rage"
20847,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"To right and left each seneschal and page,"
20848,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,"
20849,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,His white face ghastly in the torches’ glare.
20850,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;
20851,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,"
20852,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Until at last he reached the banquet-room,"
20853,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Blazing with light and breathing with perfume.
20854,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20855,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"There on the dais sat another king,"
20856,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet-ring,"
20857,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert’s self in features, form, and height,"
20858,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,But all transfigured with angelic light!
20859,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,It was an Angel; and his presence there
20860,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With a divine effulgence filled the air,"
20861,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"An exaltation, piercing the disguise,"
20862,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Though none the hidden Angel recognize.
20863,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20864,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,"
20865,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The throneless monarch on the Angel gazed,"
20866,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Who met his look of anger and surprise
20867,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,With the divine compassion of his eyes;
20868,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Then said, “Who art thou? and why com’st thou here?”"
20869,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"To which King Robert answered, with a sneer,"
20870,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“I am the King, and come to claim my own"
20871,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"From an impostor, who usurps my throne!”"
20872,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And suddenly, at these audacious words,"
20873,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;"
20874,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Angel answered, with unruffled brow,"
20875,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“Nay, not the King, but the King’s Jester, thou"
20876,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Henceforth shall wear the bells and scalloped cape,"
20877,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape;
20878,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,"
20879,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!”
20880,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20881,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Deaf to King Robert’s threats and cries and prayers,"
20882,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;
20883,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A group of tittering pages ran before,"
20884,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And as they opened wide the folding door,"
20885,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,"
20886,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,"
20887,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring
20888,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,With the mock plaudits of “Long live the King!”
20889,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20890,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Next morning, waking with the day’s first beam,"
20891,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He said within himself, “It was a dream!”"
20892,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"But the straw rustled as he turned his head,"
20893,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"There were the cap and bells beside his bed,"
20894,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,"
20895,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,"
20896,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And in the corner, a revolting shape,"
20897,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape.
20898,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,It was no dream; the world he loved so much
20899,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!
20900,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20901,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Days came and went; and now returned again
20902,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;
20903,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Under the Angel’s governance benign
20904,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The happy island danced with corn and wine,"
20905,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And deep within the mountain’s burning breast
20906,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Enceladus, the giant, was at rest."
20907,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20908,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,"
20909,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Sullen and silent and disconsolate.
20910,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,"
20911,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With look bewildered and a vacant stare,"
20912,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,"
20913,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,"
20914,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"His only friend the ape, his only food"
20915,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"What others left,—he still was unsubdued."
20916,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when the Angel met him on his way,"
20917,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And half in earnest, half in jest, would say"
20918,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel"
20919,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,"
20920,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,“Art thou the King?” the passion of his woe
20921,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Burst from him in resistless overflow,"
20922,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And, lifting high his forehead, he would fling"
20923,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The haughty answer back, “I am, I am the King!”"
20924,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20925,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Almost three years were ended; when there came
20926,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Ambassadors of great repute and name
20927,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,"
20928,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane"
20929,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,By letter summoned them forthwith to come
20930,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.
20931,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Angel with great joy received his guests,"
20932,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And gave them presents of embroidered vests,"
20933,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,"
20934,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.
20935,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Then he departed with them o’er the sea
20936,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Into the lovely land of Italy,"
20937,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Whose loveliness was more resplendent made
20938,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"By the mere passing of that cavalcade,"
20939,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir"
20940,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Of jewelled bridle and of golden spur.
20941,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And lo! among the menials, in mock state,"
20942,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,"
20943,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"His cloak of fox-tails flapping in the wind,"
20944,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The solemn ape demurely perched behind,"
20945,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert rode, making huge merriment"
20946,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,In all the country towns through which they went.
20947,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20948,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,The Pope received them with great pomp and blare
20949,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Of bannered trumpets, on Saint Peter’s square,"
20950,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Giving his benediction and embrace,"
20951,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Fervent, and full of apostolic grace."
20952,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,While with congratulations and with prayers
20953,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He entertained the Angel unawares,"
20954,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert, the Jester, bursting through the crowd,"
20955,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud,"
20956,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“I am the King! Look, and behold in me"
20957,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Robert, your brother, King of Sicily!"
20958,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,"
20959,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Is an impostor in a king’s disguise.
20960,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Do you not know me? does no voice within
20961,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Answer my cry, and say we are akin?”"
20962,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,"
20963,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Gazed at the Angel’s countenance serene;
20964,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Emperor, laughing, said, “It is strange sport"
20965,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,To keep a mad man for thy Fool at court!”
20966,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And the poor, baffled Jester in disgrace"
20967,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Was hustled back among the populace.
20968,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20969,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"In solemn state the Holy Week went by,"
20970,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;
20971,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The presence of the Angel, with its light,"
20972,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Before the sun rose, made the city bright,"
20973,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,"
20974,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.
20975,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Even the Jester, on his bed of straw,"
20976,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw,"
20977,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He felt within a power unfelt before,"
20978,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And, kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,"
20979,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,He heard the rushing garments of the Lord
20980,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward."
20981,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
20982,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And now the visit ending, and once more"
20983,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Valmond returning to the Danube’s shore,"
20984,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Homeward the Angel journeyed, and again"
20985,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The land was made resplendent with his train,"
20986,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Flashing along the towns of Italy
20987,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Unto Salerno, and from thence by sea."
20988,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when once more within Palermo’s wall,"
20989,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And, seated on the throne in his great hall,"
20990,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He heard the Angelus from convent towers,"
20991,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"As if the better world conversed with ours,"
20992,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,"
20993,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And with a gesture bade the rest retire;
20994,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when they were alone, the Angel said,"
20995,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“Art thou the King?” Then, bowing down his head,"
20996,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,"
20997,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And meekly answered him: “Thou knowest best!
20998,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,"
20999,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And in some cloister’s school of penitence,"
21000,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Across those stones, that pave the way to heaven,"
21001,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Walk barefoot, till my guilty soul be shriven!”"
21002,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
21003,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"The Angel smiled, and from his radiant face"
21004,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"A holy light illumined all the place,"
21005,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And through the open window, loud and clear,"
21006,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,"
21007,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Above the stir and tumult of the street:
21008,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“He has put down the mighty from their seat,"
21009,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And has exalted them of low degree!”
21010,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,And through the chant a second melody
21011,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,Rose like the throbbing of a single string:
21012,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"“I am an Angel, and thou art the King!”"
21013,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,
21014,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"King Robert, who was standing near the throne,"
21015,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!"
21016,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"But all apparelled as in days of old,"
21017,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;
21018,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"And when his courtiers came, they found him there"
21019,KING ROBERT OF SICILY,"Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in, silent prayer."

21026,INTERLUDE,
21027,INTERLUDE,And then the blue-eyed Norseman told
21028,INTERLUDE,A Saga of the days of old.
21029,INTERLUDE,"“There is,” said he, “a wondrous book"
21030,INTERLUDE,"Of Legends in the old Norse tongue,"
21031,INTERLUDE,"Of the dead kings of Norroway,—"
21032,INTERLUDE,Legends that once were told or sung
21033,INTERLUDE,In many a smoky fireside nook
21034,INTERLUDE,"Of Iceland, in the ancient day,"
21035,INTERLUDE,By wandering Saga-man or Scald;
21036,INTERLUDE,Heimskringla is the volume called;
21037,INTERLUDE,And he who looks may find therein
21038,INTERLUDE,The story that I now begin.”
21039,INTERLUDE,
21040,INTERLUDE,And in each pause the story made
21041,INTERLUDE,"Upon his violin he played,"
21042,INTERLUDE,"As an appropriate interlude,"
21043,INTERLUDE,Fragments of old Norwegian tunes
21044,INTERLUDE,"That bound in one the separate runes,"
21045,INTERLUDE,"And held the mind in perfect mood,"
21046,INTERLUDE,Entwining and encircling all
21047,INTERLUDE,The strange and antiquated rhymes
21048,INTERLUDE,with melodies of olden times;
21049,INTERLUDE,"As over some half-ruined wall,"
21050,INTERLUDE,"Disjointed and about to fall,"
21051,INTERLUDE,"Fresh woodbines climb and interlace,"
21052,INTERLUDE,And keep the loosened stones in place.

21123,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"Saw the red light in the sky,"
21124,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"Laid his hand upon his sword,"
21125,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"As he leaned upon the railing,"
21126,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"And his ships went sailing, sailing"
21127,KING OLAF’S RETURN,Northward into Drontheim fiord.
21128,KING OLAF’S RETURN,
21129,KING OLAF’S RETURN,There he stood as one who dreamed;
21130,KING OLAF’S RETURN,And the red light glanced and gleamed
21131,KING OLAF’S RETURN,On the armor that he wore;
21132,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"And he shouted, as the rifled"

21140,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"Listening to the wild wind’s wailing,"
21141,KING OLAF’S RETURN,And the dashing of the foam.
21142,KING OLAF’S RETURN,
21143,KING OLAF’S RETURN,To his thoughts the sacred name
21144,KING OLAF’S RETURN,"Of his mother Astrid came,"

21148,KING OLAF’S RETURN,To the home of Hakon old.

21338,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"He kissed the Queen's hand, and he whispered of love,"
21339,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,And swore to be true as the stars are above.
21340,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21341,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"But she smiled with contempt as she answered: ""O King,"
21342,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"Will you swear it, as Odin once swore, on the ring?"""
21343,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21344,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"And the King: ""O speak not of Odin to me,"

21346,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21347,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"Looking straight at the King, with her level brows,"
21348,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"She said, ""I keep true to my faith and my vows."""
21349,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21350,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"Then the face of King Olaf was darkened with gloom,"
21351,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,He rose in his anger and strode through the room.
21352,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21353,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"""Why, then, should I care to have thee?"" he said,--"
21354,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"""A faded old woman, a heathenish jade!"""
21355,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21356,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"His zeal was stronger than fear or love,"
21357,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,And he struck the Queen in the face with his glove.
21358,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21359,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"Then forth from the chamber in anger he fled,"
21360,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,And the wooden stairway shook with his tread.
21361,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,
21362,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"Queen Sigrid the Haughty said under her breath,"
21363,QUEEN SIGRID THE HAUGHTY,"""This insult, King Olaf, shall be thy death!"""

21415,THE SKERRY OF SHRIEKS,"Facing up and down the yard,"

21591,IRON-BEARD,He was the churliest of the churls;

21619,IRON-BEARD,"""Such sacrifices shalt thou bring;"

21623,IRON-BEARD,"King Olaf answered: ""I command"

21633,IRON-BEARD,"Such men as Orm of Lyra and Kar of Gryting!"""
21634,IRON-BEARD,
21635,IRON-BEARD,"Then to their Temple strode he in,"
21636,IRON-BEARD,And loud behind him heard the din
21637,IRON-BEARD,Of his men-at-arms and the peasants fiercely fighting.
21638,IRON-BEARD,
21639,IRON-BEARD,"There in the Temple, carved in wood,"
21640,IRON-BEARD,"The image of great Odin stood,"
21641,IRON-BEARD,"And other gods, with Thor supreme among them."
21642,IRON-BEARD,
21643,IRON-BEARD,King Olaf smote them with the blade
21644,IRON-BEARD,"Of his huge war-axe, gold inlaid,"
21645,IRON-BEARD,And downward shattered to the pavement flung them.
21646,IRON-BEARD,
21647,IRON-BEARD,"At the same moment rose without,"
21648,IRON-BEARD,"From the contending crowd, a shout,"
21649,IRON-BEARD,A mingled sound of triumph and of wailing.
21650,IRON-BEARD,
21651,IRON-BEARD,And there upon the trampled plain
21652,IRON-BEARD,"The farmer iron-Beard lay slain,"
21653,IRON-BEARD,Midway between the assailed and the assailing.
21654,IRON-BEARD,
21655,IRON-BEARD,King Olaf from the doorway spoke.
21656,IRON-BEARD,"""Choose ye between two things, my folk,"
21657,IRON-BEARD,"To be baptized or given up to slaughter!"""
21658,IRON-BEARD,
21659,IRON-BEARD,"And seeing their leader stark and dead,"
21660,IRON-BEARD,"The people with a murmur said,"
21661,IRON-BEARD,"""O King, baptize us with thy holy water"";"
21662,IRON-BEARD,
21663,IRON-BEARD,So all the Drontheim land became

22762,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,But not yet is assuaged
22763,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,The vengeance of Eric the Earl.
22764,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22765,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"The decks with blood are red,"
22766,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"The arrows of death are sped,"
22767,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"The ships are filled with the dead,"
22768,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,And the spears the champions hurl.
22769,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22770,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"They drift as wrecks on the tide,"
22771,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"The grappling-irons are plied,"
22772,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"The boarders climb up the side,"
22773,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,The shouts are feeble and few.
22774,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22775,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Ah! never shall Norway again
22776,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,See her sailors come back o'er the main;
22777,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"They all lie wounded or slain,"
22778,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Or asleep in the billows blue!
22779,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22780,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"On the deck stands Olaf the King,"
22781,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Around him whistle and sing
22782,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"The spears that the foemen fling,"
22783,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,And the stones they hurl with their hands.
22784,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22785,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"In the midst of the stones and the spears,"
22786,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Kolbiorn, the marshal, appears,"
22787,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"His shield in the air he uprears,"
22788,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,By the side of King Olaf he stands.
22789,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22790,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Over the slippery wreck
22791,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Of the Long Serpent's deck
22792,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Sweeps Eric with hardly a check,"
22793,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,His lips with anger are pale;
22794,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22795,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"He hews with his axe at the mast,"
22796,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Till it falls, with the sails overcast,"
22797,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Like a snow-covered pine in the vast
22798,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Dim forests of Orkadale.
22799,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22800,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Seeking King Olaf then,"
22801,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"He rushes aft with his men,"
22802,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,As a hunter into the den
22803,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Of the bear, when he stands at bay."
22804,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22805,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"""Remember Jarl Hakon!"" he cries;"

22807,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Two kingly figures arise,"
22808,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Two Olaf's in warlike array!
22809,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22810,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Then Kolbiorn speaks in the ear
22811,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Of King Olaf a word of cheer,"
22812,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"In a whisper that none may hear,"
22813,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,With a smile on his tremulous lip;
22814,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22815,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Two shields raised high in the air,"
22816,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Two flashes of golden hair,"
22817,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Two scarlet meteors' glare,"
22818,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,And both have leaped from the ship.
22819,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22820,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Earl Eric's men in the boats
22821,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Seize Kolbiorn's shield as it floats,"
22822,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"And cry, from their hairy throats,"
22823,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"""See! it is Olaf the King!"""
22824,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22825,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,While far on the opposite side
22826,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Floats another shield on the tide,"
22827,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Like a jewel set in the wide
22828,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Sea-current's eddying ring.
22829,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22830,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"There is told a wonderful tale,"
22831,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"How the King stripped off his mail,"
22832,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"Like leaves of the brown sea-kale,"
22833,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,As he swam beneath the main;
22834,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,
22835,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"But the young grew old and gray,"
22836,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,"And never, by night or by day,"
22837,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,In his kingdom of Norroway
22838,KING OLAF'S DEATH-DRINK,Was King Olaf seen again!

23013,TORQUEMADA,In the heroic days when Ferdinand
23014,TORQUEMADA,"And Isabella ruled the Spanish land,"
23015,TORQUEMADA,"And Torquemada, with his subtle brain,"
23016,TORQUEMADA,"Ruled them, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain,"
23017,TORQUEMADA,"In a great castle near Valladolid,"
23018,TORQUEMADA,"Moated and high and by fair woodlands hid,"

23025,TORQUEMADA,"Unless, perchance, our eyes can see therein"

23029,TORQUEMADA,
23030,TORQUEMADA,This sombre man counted each day as lost
23031,TORQUEMADA,On which his feet no sacred threshold crossed;
23032,TORQUEMADA,"And when he chanced the passing Host to meet,"
23033,TORQUEMADA,He knelt and prayed devoutly in the street;
23034,TORQUEMADA,"Oft he confessed; and with each mutinous thought,"
23035,TORQUEMADA,"As with wild beasts at Ephesus, he fought."
23036,TORQUEMADA,"In deep contrition scourged himself in Lent,"
23037,TORQUEMADA,"Walked in processions, with his head down bent,"
23038,TORQUEMADA,"At plays of Corpus Christi oft was seen,"
23039,TORQUEMADA,And on Palm Sunday bore his bough of green.
23040,TORQUEMADA,His sole diversion was to hunt the boar
23041,TORQUEMADA,"Through tangled thickets of the forest hoar,"
23042,TORQUEMADA,Or with his jingling mules to hurry down
23043,TORQUEMADA,"To some grand bull-fight in the neighboring town,"
23044,TORQUEMADA,"Or in the crowd with lighted taper stand,"
23045,TORQUEMADA,"When Jews were burned, or banished from the land."
23046,TORQUEMADA,Then stirred within him a tumultuous joy;
23047,TORQUEMADA,The demon whose delight is to destroy
23048,TORQUEMADA,"Shook him, and shouted with a trumpet tone,"

23055,TORQUEMADA,"Reminding him of their dead mother's face,"
23056,TORQUEMADA,"When first she came into that gloomy place,--"
23057,TORQUEMADA,A memory in his heart as dim and sweet
23058,TORQUEMADA,"As moonlight in a solitary street,"
23059,TORQUEMADA,"Where the same rays, that lift the sea, are thrown"
23060,TORQUEMADA,Lovely but powerless upon walls of stone.
23061,TORQUEMADA,These two fair daughters of a mother dead
23062,TORQUEMADA,Were all the dream had left him as it fled.
23063,TORQUEMADA,"A joy at first, and then a growing care,"
23064,TORQUEMADA,"As if a voice within him cried, ""Beware"
23065,TORQUEMADA,"A vague presentiment of impending doom,"
23066,TORQUEMADA,"Like ghostly footsteps in a vacant room,"

23068,TORQUEMADA,"That death to some one of his house was near,"
23069,TORQUEMADA,"With dark surmises of a hidden crime,"
23070,TORQUEMADA,Made life itself a death before its time.
23071,TORQUEMADA,"Jealous, suspicious, with no sense of shame,"
23072,TORQUEMADA,A spy upon his daughters he became;
23073,TORQUEMADA,"With velvet slippers, noiseless on the floors,"
23074,TORQUEMADA,He glided softly through half-open doors;
23075,TORQUEMADA,"Now in the room, and now upon the stair,"
23076,TORQUEMADA,He stood beside them ere they were aware;
23077,TORQUEMADA,"He listened in the passage when they talked,"
23078,TORQUEMADA,"He watched them from the casement when they walked,"
23079,TORQUEMADA,"He saw the gypsy haunt the river's side,"
23080,TORQUEMADA,He saw the monk among the cork-trees glide;
23081,TORQUEMADA,"And, tortured by the mystery and the doubt"
23082,TORQUEMADA,"Of some dark secret, past his finding out,"
23083,TORQUEMADA,Baffled he paused; then reassured again
23084,TORQUEMADA,Pursued the flying phantom of his brain.
23085,TORQUEMADA,He watched them even when they knelt in church;
23086,TORQUEMADA,"And then, descending lower in his search,"
23087,TORQUEMADA,"Questioned the servants, and with eager eyes"
23088,TORQUEMADA,Listened incredulous to their replies;
23089,TORQUEMADA,The gypsy? none had seen her in the wood!
23090,TORQUEMADA,The monk? a mendicant in search of food!
23091,TORQUEMADA,
23092,TORQUEMADA,"At length the awful revelation came,"
23093,TORQUEMADA,Crushing at once his pride of birth and name;

23095,TORQUEMADA,"And the ancestral glories of the vast,"
23096,TORQUEMADA,"All fell together, crumbling in disgrace,"

23104,TORQUEMADA,"Repeating one dread word, till bush and tree"

23109,TORQUEMADA,"He walked all night the alleys of his park,"
23110,TORQUEMADA,"With one unseen companion in the dark,"
23111,TORQUEMADA,"The Demon who within him lay in wait,"
23112,TORQUEMADA,"And by his presence turned his love to hate,"
23113,TORQUEMADA,"Forever muttering in an undertone,"
23114,TORQUEMADA,"""Kill! kill! and let the Lord find out his own!"""
23115,TORQUEMADA,
23116,TORQUEMADA,"Upon the morrow, after early Mass,"
23117,TORQUEMADA,"While yet the dew was glistening on the grass,"
23118,TORQUEMADA,"And all the woods were musical with birds,"
23119,TORQUEMADA,"The old Hidalgo, uttering fearful words,"
23120,TORQUEMADA,"Walked homeward with the Priest, and in his room"
23121,TORQUEMADA,Summoned his trembling daughters to their doom.
23122,TORQUEMADA,"When questioned, with brief answers they replied,"
23123,TORQUEMADA,Nor when accused evaded or denied;
23124,TORQUEMADA,"Expostulations, passionate appeals,"
23125,TORQUEMADA,"All that the human heart most fears or feels,"
23126,TORQUEMADA,In vain the Priest with earnest voice essayed;
23127,TORQUEMADA,"In vain the father threatened, wept, and prayed;"
23128,TORQUEMADA,"Until at last he said, with haughty mien,"
23129,TORQUEMADA,"""The Holy Office, then, must intervene!"""
23130,TORQUEMADA,
23131,TORQUEMADA,"And now the Grand Inquisitor of Spain,"
23132,TORQUEMADA,"With all the fifty horsemen of his train,"
23133,TORQUEMADA,"His awful name resounding, like the blast"
23134,TORQUEMADA,"Of funeral trumpets, as he onward passed,"
23135,TORQUEMADA,"Came to Valladolid, and there began"
23136,TORQUEMADA,To harry the rich Jews with fire and ban.
23137,TORQUEMADA,"To him the Hidalgo went, and at the gate"
23138,TORQUEMADA,"Demanded audience on affairs of state,"
23139,TORQUEMADA,And in a secret chamber stood before
23140,TORQUEMADA,"A venerable graybeard of fourscore,"
23141,TORQUEMADA,Dressed in the hood and habit of a friar;
23142,TORQUEMADA,"Out of his eyes flashed a consuming fire,"
23143,TORQUEMADA,"And in his hand the mystic horn he held,"
23144,TORQUEMADA,Which poison and all noxious charms dispelled.
23145,TORQUEMADA,"He heard in silence the Hidalgo's tale,"
23146,TORQUEMADA,Then answered in a voice that made him quail:
23147,TORQUEMADA,"""Son of the Church! when Abraham of old"
23148,TORQUEMADA,"To sacrifice his only son was told,"
23149,TORQUEMADA,He did not pause to parley nor protest
23150,TORQUEMADA,But hastened to obey the Lord's behest.
23151,TORQUEMADA,In him it was accounted righteousness;
23152,TORQUEMADA,"The Holy Church expects of thee no less!"""
23153,TORQUEMADA,
23154,TORQUEMADA,"A sacred frenzy seized the father's brain,"
23155,TORQUEMADA,And Mercy from that hour implored in vain.
23156,TORQUEMADA,Ah! who will e'er believe the words I say?
23157,TORQUEMADA,"His daughters he accused, and the same day"
23158,TORQUEMADA,"They both were cast into the dungeon's gloom,"
23159,TORQUEMADA,"That dismal antechamber of the tomb,"
23160,TORQUEMADA,"Arraigned, condemned, and sentenced to the flame,"
23161,TORQUEMADA,The secret torture and the public shame.
23162,TORQUEMADA,
23163,TORQUEMADA,Then to the Grand Inquisitor once more
23164,TORQUEMADA,"The Hidalgo went, more eager than before,"
23165,TORQUEMADA,"And said: ""When Abraham offered up his son,"
23166,TORQUEMADA,He clave the wood wherewith it might be done.
23167,TORQUEMADA,"By his example taught, let me too bring"
23168,TORQUEMADA,"Wood from the forest for my offering!"""
23169,TORQUEMADA,"And the deep voice, without a pause, replied:"
23170,TORQUEMADA,"""Son of the Church! by faith now justified,"
23171,TORQUEMADA,"Complete thy sacrifice, even as thou wilt;"
23172,TORQUEMADA,"The Church absolves thy conscience from all guilt!"""
23173,TORQUEMADA,
23174,TORQUEMADA,Then this most wretched father went his way
23175,TORQUEMADA,"Into the woods, that round his castle lay,"
23176,TORQUEMADA,Where once his daughters in their childhood played
23177,TORQUEMADA,With their young mother in the sun and shade.
23178,TORQUEMADA,Now all the leaves had fallen; the branches bare
23179,TORQUEMADA,"Made a perpetual moaning in the air,"
23180,TORQUEMADA,And screaming from their eyries overhead
23181,TORQUEMADA,The ravens sailed athwart the sky of lead.
23182,TORQUEMADA,With his own hands he lopped the boughs and bound
23183,TORQUEMADA,"Fagots, that crackled with foreboding sound,"
23184,TORQUEMADA,"And on his mules, caparisoned and gay"
23185,TORQUEMADA,"With bells and tassels, sent them on their way."
23186,TORQUEMADA,
23187,TORQUEMADA,"Then with his mind on one dark purpose bent,"
23188,TORQUEMADA,"Again to the Inquisitor he went,"
23189,TORQUEMADA,"And said: ""Behold, the fagots I have brought,"
23190,TORQUEMADA,"And now, lest my atonement be as naught,"
23191,TORQUEMADA,"Grant me one more request, one last desire,--"
23192,TORQUEMADA,"With my own hand to light the funeral fire!"""
23193,TORQUEMADA,"And Torquemada answered from his seat,"
23194,TORQUEMADA,"""Son of the Church!  Thine offering is complete;"
23195,TORQUEMADA,Her servants through all ages shall not cease
23196,TORQUEMADA,"To magnify thy deed.  Depart in peace!"""
23197,TORQUEMADA,
23198,TORQUEMADA,"Upon the market-place, builded of stone"
23199,TORQUEMADA,"The scaffold rose, whereon Death claimed his own."
23200,TORQUEMADA,"At the four corners, in stern attitude,"
23201,TORQUEMADA,"Four statues of the Hebrew Prophets stood,"
23202,TORQUEMADA,Gazing with calm indifference in their eyes
23203,TORQUEMADA,"Upon this place of human sacrifice,"
23204,TORQUEMADA,"Round which was gathering fast the eager crowd,"
23205,TORQUEMADA,"With clamor of voices dissonant and loud,"
23206,TORQUEMADA,And every roof and window was alive
23207,TORQUEMADA,"With restless gazers, swarming like a hive."
23208,TORQUEMADA,
23209,TORQUEMADA,"The church-bells tolled, the chant of monks drew near,"
23210,TORQUEMADA,"Loud trumpets stammered forth their notes of fear,"
23211,TORQUEMADA,"A line of torches smoked along the street,"
23212,TORQUEMADA,"There was a stir, a rush, a tramp of feet,"
23213,TORQUEMADA,"And, with its banners floating in the air,"
23214,TORQUEMADA,"Slowly the long procession crossed the square,"
23215,TORQUEMADA,"And, to the statues of the Prophets bound,"
23216,TORQUEMADA,"The victims stood, with fagots piled around."
23217,TORQUEMADA,"Then all the air a blast of trumpets shook,"
23218,TORQUEMADA,"And louder sang the monks with bell and book,"
23219,TORQUEMADA,"And the Hidalgo, lofty, stern, and proud,"
23220,TORQUEMADA,"Lifted his torch, and, bursting through the crowd,"
23221,TORQUEMADA,"Lighted in haste the fagots, and then fled,"
23222,TORQUEMADA,Lest those imploring eyes should strike him dead!
23223,TORQUEMADA,
23224,TORQUEMADA,O pitiless skies! why did your clouds retain
23225,TORQUEMADA,For peasants' fields their floods of hoarded rain?
23226,TORQUEMADA,O pitiless earth! why open no abyss
23227,TORQUEMADA,To bury in its chasm a crime like this?
23228,TORQUEMADA,
23229,TORQUEMADA,That night a mingled column of fire and smoke
23230,TORQUEMADA,"Prom the dark thickets of the forest broke,"
23231,TORQUEMADA,"And, glaring o'er the landscape leagues away,"
23232,TORQUEMADA,Made all the fields and hamlets bright as day.
23233,TORQUEMADA,"Wrapped in a sheet of flame the castle blazed,"
23234,TORQUEMADA,"And as the villagers in terror gazed,"
23235,TORQUEMADA,They saw the figure of that cruel knight
23236,TORQUEMADA,"Lean from a window in the turret's height,"
23237,TORQUEMADA,"His ghastly face illumined with the glare,"
23238,TORQUEMADA,"His hands upraised above his head in prayer,"
23239,TORQUEMADA,"Till the floor sank beneath him, and he fell"
23240,TORQUEMADA,Down the black hollow of that burning well.
23241,TORQUEMADA,
23242,TORQUEMADA,Three centuries and more above his bones
23243,TORQUEMADA,Have piled the oblivious years like funeral stones;
23244,TORQUEMADA,"His name has perished with him, and no trace"
23245,TORQUEMADA,Remains on earth of his afflicted race;
23246,TORQUEMADA,"But Torquemada's name, with clouds o'ercast,"
23247,TORQUEMADA,"Looms in the distant landscape of the Past,"
23248,TORQUEMADA,"Like a burnt tower upon a blackened heath,"
23249,TORQUEMADA,Lit by the fires of burning woods beneath!

23254,INTERLUDE,
23255,INTERLUDE,"Thus closed the tale of guilt and gloom,"
23256,INTERLUDE,That cast upon each listener's face
23257,INTERLUDE,"Its shadow, and for some brief space"
23258,INTERLUDE,Unbroken silence filled the room.
23259,INTERLUDE,The Jew was thoughtful and distressed;
23260,INTERLUDE,Upon his memory thronged and pressed
23261,INTERLUDE,"The persecution of his race,"
23262,INTERLUDE,Their wrongs and sufferings and disgrace;
23263,INTERLUDE,"His head was sunk upon his breast,"
23264,INTERLUDE,And from his eyes alternate came
23265,INTERLUDE,Flashes of wrath and tears of shame.
23266,INTERLUDE,
23267,INTERLUDE,"The student first the silence broke,"
23268,INTERLUDE,As one who long has lain in wait
23269,INTERLUDE,"With purpose to retaliate,"
23270,INTERLUDE,And thus he dealt the avenging stroke.
23271,INTERLUDE,"""In such a company as this,"
23272,INTERLUDE,"A tale so tragic seems amiss,"
23273,INTERLUDE,That by its terrible control
23274,INTERLUDE,O'ermasters and drags down the soul
23275,INTERLUDE,Into a fathomless abyss.
23276,INTERLUDE,"The Italian Tales that you disdain,"
23277,INTERLUDE,"Some merry Night of Straparole,"
23278,INTERLUDE,"Or Machiavelli's Belphagor,"
23279,INTERLUDE,"Would cheer us and delight us more,"

23285,INTERLUDE,"It stopped discussion at its birth,"
23286,INTERLUDE,"And said: ""The story I shall tell"
23287,INTERLUDE,"Has meaning in it, if not mirth;"

23297,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"It was the season, when through all the land"
23298,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The merle and mavis build, and building sing"
23299,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Those lovely lyrics, written by His hand,"
23300,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Whom Saxon Caedmon calls the Blitheheart King;

23302,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The banners of the vanguard of the Spring,"
23303,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And rivulets, rejoicing, rush and leap,"
23304,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And wave their fluttering signals from the steep.
23305,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23306,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The robin and the bluebird, piping loud,"
23307,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Filled all the blossoming orchards with their glee;
23308,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The sparrows chirped as if they still were proud
23309,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Their race in Holy Writ should mentioned be;
23310,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And hungry crows assembled in a crowd,"
23311,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Clamored their piteous prayer incessantly,"
23312,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Knowing who hears the ravens cry, and said:"
23313,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"""Give us, O Lord, this day our daily bread!"""
23314,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23315,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Across the Sound the birds of passage sailed,"
23316,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Speaking some unknown language strange and sweet
23317,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Of tropic isle remote, and passing hailed"
23318,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The village with the cheers of all their fleet;
23319,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Or quarrelling together, laughed and railed"
23320,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Like foreign sailors, landed in the street"
23321,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Of seaport town, and with outlandish noise"
23322,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Of oaths and gibberish frightening girls and boys.
23323,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23324,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Thus came the jocund Spring in Killingworth,"
23325,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,In fabulous day; some hundred years ago;
23326,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And thrifty farmers, as they tilled the earth,"
23327,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Heard with alarm the cawing of the crow,"
23328,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"That mingled with the universal mirth,"
23329,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Cassandra-like, prognosticating woe;"
23330,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"They shook their heads, and doomed with dreadful words"
23331,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,To swift destruction the whole race of birds.
23332,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23333,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And a town-meeting was convened straightway
23334,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,To set a price upon the guilty heads
23335,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Of these marauders, who, in lieu of pay,"
23336,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Levied black-mail upon the garden beds
23337,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And cornfields, and beheld without dismay"
23338,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The awful scarecrow, with his fluttering shreds;"
23339,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The skeleton that waited at their feast,"

23343,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"With fluted columns, and a roof of red,"
23344,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The Squire came forth, august and splendid sight!"
23345,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Slowly descending, with majestic tread,"
23346,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Three flights of steps, nor looking left nor right,"

23353,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The wrath of God he preached from year to year,"
23354,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And read, with fervor, Edwards on the Will;"
23355,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,His favorite pastime was to slay the deer
23356,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,In Summer on some Adirondac hill;
23357,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"E'en now, while walking down the rural lane,"
23358,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,He lopped the wayside lilies with his cane.
23359,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23360,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"From the Academy, whose belfry crowned"

23364,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And all absorbed in reveries profound
23365,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Of fair Almira in the upper class,"
23366,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Who was, as in a sonnet he had said,"
23367,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"As pure as water, and as good as bread."

23372,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"His form was ponderous, and his step was slow;"
23373,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,There never was so wise a man before;
23374,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"He seemed the incarnate ""Well, I told you so!"""
23375,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And to perpetuate his great renown
23376,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,There was a street named after him in town.

23378,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"These came together in the new town-hall,"
23379,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,With sundry farmers from the region round.
23380,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The Squirt presided, dignified and tall,"
23381,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,His air impressive and his reasoning sound;
23382,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Ill fared it with the birds, both great and small;"
23383,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Hardly a friend in all that crowd they found,"
23384,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"But enemies enough, who every one"

23386,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23387,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"When they had ended, from his place apart,"
23388,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Rose the Preceptor, to redress the wrong,"
23389,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And, trembling like a steed before the start,"
23390,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Looked round bewildered on the expectant throng;
23391,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Then thought of fair Almira, and took heart"
23392,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"To speak out what was in him, clear and strong,"
23393,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Alike regardless of their smile or frown,"

23458,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23459,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"""You call them thieves and pillagers; but know,"
23460,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"They are the winged wardens of your farms,"
23461,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Who from the cornfields drive the insidious foe,"
23462,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And from your harvests keep a hundred harms;
23463,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Even the blackest of them all, the crow,"
23464,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Renders good service as your man-at-arms,"
23465,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Crushing the beetle in his coat of mail,"
23466,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And crying havoc on the slug and snail.
23467,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23468,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"""How can I teach your children gentleness,"
23469,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And mercy to the weak, and reverence"
23470,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"For Life, which, in its weakness or excess,"
23471,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Is still a gleam of God's omnipotence,"
23472,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Or Death, which, seeming darkness, is no less"
23473,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The selfsame light, although averted hence,"
23474,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"When by your laws, your actions, and your speech,"
23475,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"You contradict the very things I teach?"""
23476,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23477,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,With this he closed; and through the audience went
23478,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"A murmur, like the rustle of dead leaves;"
23479,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The farmers laughed and nodded, and some bent"
23480,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Their yellow heads together like their sheaves;
23481,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Men have no faith in fine-spun sentiment
23482,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Who put their trust in bullocks and in beeves.
23483,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The birds were doomed; and, as the record shows,"
23484,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,A bounty offered for the heads of crows.
23485,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23486,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"There was another audience out of reach,"
23487,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Who had no voice nor vote in making laws,"
23488,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"But in the papers read his little speech,"
23489,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And crowned his modest temples with applause;
23490,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"They made him conscious, each one more than each,"
23491,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"He still was victor, vanquished in their cause."
23492,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Sweetest of all the applause he won from thee,"
23493,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,O fair Almira at the Academy!
23494,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23495,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And so the dreadful massacre began;
23496,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"O'er fields and orchards, and o'er woodland crests,"
23497,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The ceaseless fusillade of terror ran.
23498,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Dead fell the birds, with blood-stains on their breasts,"
23499,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Or wounded crept away from sight of man,"
23500,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,While the young died of famine in their nests;
23501,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"A slaughter to be told in groans, not words,"
23502,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The very St. Bartholomew of Birds!
23503,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23504,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The Summer came, and all the birds were dead;"
23505,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The days were like hot coals; the very ground
23506,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Was burned to ashes; in the orchards fed
23507,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Myriads of caterpillars, and around"
23508,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The cultivated fields and garden beds
23509,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Hosts of devouring insects crawled, and found"
23510,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"No foe to check their march, till they had made"
23511,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The land a desert without leaf or shade.
23512,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23513,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Devoured by worms, like Herod, was the town,"
23514,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Because, like Herod, it had ruthlessly"
23515,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Slaughtered the Innocents.  From the trees spun down
23516,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The canker-worms upon the passers-by,"
23517,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Upon each woman's bonnet, shawl, and gown,"
23518,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Who shook them off with just a little cry
23519,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"They were the terror of each favorite walk,"
23520,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The endless theme of all the village talk.
23521,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23522,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The farmers grew impatient but a few
23523,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Confessed their error, and would not complain,"
23524,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"For after all, the best thing one can do"
23525,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"When it is raining, is to let it rain."
23526,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Then they repealed the law, although they knew"
23527,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,It would not call the dead to life again;
23528,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"As school-boys, finding their mistake too late,"
23529,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Draw a wet sponge across the accusing slate.
23530,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23531,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,That year in Killingworth the Autumn came
23532,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Without the light of his majestic look,"
23533,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"The wonder of the falling tongues of flame,"
23534,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,The illumined pages of his Doom's-Day book.
23535,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"A few lost leaves blushed crimson with their shame,"
23536,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And drowned themselves despairing in the brook,"
23537,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"While the wild wind went moaning everywhere,"
23538,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Lamenting the dead children of the air!
23539,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23540,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"But the next Spring a stranger sight was seen,"
23541,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"A sight that never yet by bard was sung,"
23542,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,As great a wonder as it would have been
23543,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,If some dumb animal had found a tongue!
23544,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"A wagon, overarched with evergreen,"
23545,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Upon whose boughs were wicker cages hung,"
23546,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"All full of singing birds, came down the street,"
23547,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Filling the air with music wild and sweet.
23548,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23549,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"From all the country round these birds were brought,"
23550,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"By order of the town, with anxious quest,"
23551,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And, loosened from their wicker prisons, sought"
23552,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"In woods and fields the places they loved best,"
23553,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Singing loud canticles, which many thought"
23554,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Were satires to the authorities addressed,"
23555,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"While others, listening in green lanes, averred"
23556,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Such lovely music never had been heard!
23557,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,
23558,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,But blither still and louder carolled they
23559,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Upon the morrow, for they seemed to know"
23560,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"It was the fair Almira's wedding-day,"
23561,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"And everywhere, around, above, below,"
23562,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"When the Preceptor bore his bride away,"
23563,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,"Their songs burst forth in joyous overflow,"
23564,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,And a new heaven bent over a new earth
23565,THE BIRDS OF KILLINGWORTH,Amid the sunny farms of Killingworth.

23576,FINALE,"At this all laughed; the Landlord stirred,"

23600,PRELUDE,
23601,PRELUDE,"A cold, uninterrupted rain,"
23602,PRELUDE,"That washed each southern window-pane,"
23603,PRELUDE,And made a river of the road;
23604,PRELUDE,A sea of mist that overflowed
23605,PRELUDE,"The house, the barns, the gilded vane,"
23606,PRELUDE,"And drowned the upland and the plain,"
23607,PRELUDE,"Through which the oak-trees, broad and high,"
23608,PRELUDE,Like phantom ships went drifting by;
23609,PRELUDE,"And, hidden behind a watery screen,"
23610,PRELUDE,"The sun unseen, or only seen"
23611,PRELUDE,As a faint pallor in the sky;--
23612,PRELUDE,"Thus cold and colorless and gray,"
23613,PRELUDE,"The morn of that autumnal day,"
23614,PRELUDE,"As if reluctant to begin,"
23615,PRELUDE,"Dawned on the silent Sudbury Inn,"
23616,PRELUDE,And all the guests that in it lay.
23617,PRELUDE,
23618,PRELUDE,Full late they slept.  They did not hear
23619,PRELUDE,"The challenge of Sir Chanticleer,"
23620,PRELUDE,"Who on the empty threshing-floor,"
23621,PRELUDE,"Disdainful of the rain outside,"
23622,PRELUDE,"Was strutting with a martial stride,"
23623,PRELUDE,As if upon his thigh he wore
23624,PRELUDE,"The famous broadsword of the Squire,"
23625,PRELUDE,"And said, ""Behold me, and admire!"""
23626,PRELUDE,
23627,PRELUDE,"Only the Poet seemed to hear,"
23628,PRELUDE,"In drowse or dream, more near and near"
23629,PRELUDE,Across the border-land of sleep
23630,PRELUDE,"The blowing of a blithesome horn,"
23631,PRELUDE,That laughed the dismal day to scorn;
23632,PRELUDE,A splash of hoofs and rush of wheels
23633,PRELUDE,"Through sand and mire like stranding keels,"
23634,PRELUDE,As from the road with sudden sweep
23635,PRELUDE,"The Mail drove up the little steep,"
23636,PRELUDE,And stopped beside the tavern door;
23637,PRELUDE,"A moment stopped, and then again"
23638,PRELUDE,With crack of whip and bark of dog
23639,PRELUDE,"Plunged forward through the sea of fog,"
23640,PRELUDE,"And all was silent as before,--"
23641,PRELUDE,All silent save the dripping rain.
23642,PRELUDE,
23643,PRELUDE,"Then one by one the guests came down,"
23644,PRELUDE,"And greeted with a smile the Squire,"
23645,PRELUDE,"Who sat before the parlor fire,"
23646,PRELUDE,Reading the paper fresh from town.
23647,PRELUDE,"First the Sicilian, like a bird,"
23648,PRELUDE,"Before his form appeared, was heard"
23649,PRELUDE,Whistling and singing down the stair;
23650,PRELUDE,"Then came the Student, with a look"
23651,PRELUDE,As placid as a meadow-brook;
23652,PRELUDE,"The Theologian, still perplexed"
23653,PRELUDE,With thoughts of this world and the next;
23654,PRELUDE,"The Poet then, as one who seems"
23655,PRELUDE,Walking in visions and in dreams;
23656,PRELUDE,"Then the Musician, like a fair"
23657,PRELUDE,Hyperion from whose golden hair
23658,PRELUDE,The radiance of the morning streams;
23659,PRELUDE,And last the aromatic Jew
23660,PRELUDE,"Of Alicant, who, as he threw"
23661,PRELUDE,"The door wide open, on the air"
23662,PRELUDE,Breathed round about him a perfume
23663,PRELUDE,"Of damask roses in full bloom,"
23664,PRELUDE,Making a garden of the room.
23665,PRELUDE,
23666,PRELUDE,"The breakfast ended, each pursued"
23667,PRELUDE,The promptings of his various mood;
23668,PRELUDE,Beside the fire in silence smoked
23669,PRELUDE,"The taciturn, impassive Jew,"
23670,PRELUDE,Lost in a pleasant revery;
23671,PRELUDE,"While, by his gravity provoked,"
23672,PRELUDE,"His portrait the Sicilian drew,"
23673,PRELUDE,"And wrote beneath it ""Edrehi,"
23674,PRELUDE,"At the Red Horse in Sudbury."""
23675,PRELUDE,
23676,PRELUDE,"By far the busiest of them all,"
23677,PRELUDE,The Theologian in the hall
23678,PRELUDE,"Was feeding robins in a cage,--"
23679,PRELUDE,"Two corpulent and lazy birds,"
23680,PRELUDE,"Vagrants and pilferers at best,"
23681,PRELUDE,"If one might trust the hostler's words,"
23682,PRELUDE,Chief instrument of their arrest;
23683,PRELUDE,"Two poets of the Golden Age,"
23684,PRELUDE,Heirs of a boundless heritage
23685,PRELUDE,"Of fields and orchards, east and west,"
23686,PRELUDE,"And sunshine of long summer days,"
23687,PRELUDE,Though outlawed now and dispossessed!--
23688,PRELUDE,Such was the Theologian's phrase.
23689,PRELUDE,
23690,PRELUDE,Meanwhile the Student held discourse
23691,PRELUDE,"With the Musician, on the source"
23692,PRELUDE,Of all the legendary lore
23693,PRELUDE,"Among the nations, scattered wide"
23694,PRELUDE,Like silt and seaweed by the force
23695,PRELUDE,And fluctuation of the tide;
23696,PRELUDE,"The tale repeated o'er and o'er,"
23697,PRELUDE,"With change of place and change of name,"
23698,PRELUDE,"Disguised, transformed, and yet the same"
23699,PRELUDE,We've heard a hundred times before.
23700,PRELUDE,
23701,PRELUDE,"The Poet at the window mused,"
23702,PRELUDE,"And saw, as in a dream confused,"
23703,PRELUDE,"The countenance of the Sun, discrowned,"
23704,PRELUDE,"And haggard with a pale despair,"
23705,PRELUDE,And saw the cloud-rack trail and drift
23706,PRELUDE,"Before it, and the trees uplift"
23707,PRELUDE,"Their leafless branches, and the air"
23708,PRELUDE,"Filled with the arrows of the rain,"
23709,PRELUDE,"And heard amid the mist below,"
23710,PRELUDE,"Like voices of distress and pain,"
23711,PRELUDE,"That haunt the thoughts of men insane,"
23712,PRELUDE,The fateful cawings of the crow.
23713,PRELUDE,
23714,PRELUDE,"Then down the road, with mud besprent,"
23715,PRELUDE,"And drenched with rain from head to hoof,"
23716,PRELUDE,The rain-drops dripping from his mane
23717,PRELUDE,"And tail as from a pent-house roof,"
23718,PRELUDE,"A jaded horse, his head down bent,"
23719,PRELUDE,"Passed slowly, limping as he went."
23720,PRELUDE,
23721,PRELUDE,The young Sicilian--who had grown
23722,PRELUDE,Impatient longer to abide
23723,PRELUDE,"A prisoner, greatly mortified"
23724,PRELUDE,To see completely overthrown
23725,PRELUDE,"His plans for angling in the brook,"
23726,PRELUDE,"And, leaning o'er the bridge of stone,"
23727,PRELUDE,"To watch the speckled trout glide by,"
23728,PRELUDE,"And float through the inverted sky,"
23729,PRELUDE,Still round and round the baited hook--
23730,PRELUDE,"Now paced the room with rapid stride,"
23731,PRELUDE,"And, pausing at the Poet's side,"
23732,PRELUDE,"Looked forth, and saw the wretched steed,"
23733,PRELUDE,"And said: ""Alas for human greed,"
23734,PRELUDE,That with cold hand and stony eye
23735,PRELUDE,"Thus turns an old friend out to die,"
23736,PRELUDE,Or beg his food from gate to gate!
23737,PRELUDE,"This brings a tale into my mind,"
23738,PRELUDE,"Which, if you are not disinclined"
23739,PRELUDE,"To listen, I will now relate."""
23740,PRELUDE,
23741,PRELUDE,"All gave assent; all wished to hear,"
23742,PRELUDE,"Not without many a jest and jeer,"
23743,PRELUDE,The story of a spavined steed;
23744,PRELUDE,And even the Student with the rest
23745,PRELUDE,Put in his pleasant little jest
23746,PRELUDE,"Out of Malherbe, that Pegasus"
23747,PRELUDE,Is but a horse that with all speed
23748,PRELUDE,Bears poets to the hospital;
23749,PRELUDE,"While the Sicilian, self-possessed,"
23750,PRELUDE,After a moment's interval
23751,PRELUDE,Began his simple story thus.

23758,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23759,THE BELL OF ATRI,"At Atri in Abruzzo, a small town"
23760,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Of ancient Roman date, but scant renown,"
23761,THE BELL OF ATRI,One of those little places that have run
23762,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Half up the hill, beneath a blazing sun,"
23763,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And then sat down to rest, as if to say,"
23764,THE BELL OF ATRI,"""I climb no farther upward, come what may,""--"
23765,THE BELL OF ATRI,"The Re Giovanni, now unknown to fame,"
23766,THE BELL OF ATRI,"So many monarchs since have borne the name,"
23767,THE BELL OF ATRI,Had a great bell hung in the market-place
23768,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Beneath a roof, projecting some small space,"
23769,THE BELL OF ATRI,By way of shelter from the sun and rain.
23770,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Then rode he through the streets with all his train,"
23771,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And, with the blast of trumpets loud and long,"
23772,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Made proclamation, that whenever wrong"
23773,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Was done to any man, he should but ring"
23774,THE BELL OF ATRI,"The great bell in the square, and he, the King,"
23775,THE BELL OF ATRI,Would cause the Syndic to decide thereon.
23776,THE BELL OF ATRI,Such was the proclamation of King John.
23777,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23778,THE BELL OF ATRI,"How swift the happy days in Atri sped,"
23779,THE BELL OF ATRI,"What wrongs were righted, need not here be said."
23780,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Suffice it that, as all things must decay,"
23781,THE BELL OF ATRI,"The hempen rope at length was worn away,"
23782,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Unravelled at the end, and, strand by strand,"
23783,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Loosened and wasted in the ringer's hand,"
23784,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Till one, who noted this in passing by,"
23785,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Mended the rope with braids of briony,"
23786,THE BELL OF ATRI,So that the leaves and tendrils of the vine
23787,THE BELL OF ATRI,Hung like a votive garland at a shrine.
23788,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23789,THE BELL OF ATRI,By chance it happened that in Atri dwelt
23790,THE BELL OF ATRI,"A knight, with spur on heel and sword in belt,"
23791,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Who loved to hunt the wild-boar in the woods,"
23792,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Who loved his falcons with their crimson hoods,"
23793,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Who loved his hounds and horses, and all sports"
23794,THE BELL OF ATRI,And prodigalities of camps and courts;--
23795,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Loved, or had loved them; for at last, grown old,"
23796,THE BELL OF ATRI,His only passion was the love of gold.
23797,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23798,THE BELL OF ATRI,"He sold his horses, sold his hawks and hounds,"
23799,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Rented his vineyards and his garden-grounds,"
23800,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Kept but one steed, his favorite steed of all,"
23801,THE BELL OF ATRI,"To starve and shiver in a naked stall,"
23802,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And day by day sat brooding in his chair,"
23803,THE BELL OF ATRI,Devising plans how best to hoard and spare.
23804,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23805,THE BELL OF ATRI,"At length he said: ""What is the use or need"
23806,THE BELL OF ATRI,"To keep at my own cost this lazy steed,"
23807,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Eating his head off in my stables here,"
23808,THE BELL OF ATRI,When rents are low and provender is dear?
23809,THE BELL OF ATRI,Let him go feed upon the public ways;
23810,THE BELL OF ATRI,"I want him only for the holidays."""
23811,THE BELL OF ATRI,So the old steed was turned into the heat
23812,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Of the long, lonely, silent, shadeless street;"
23813,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And wandered in suburban lanes forlorn,"
23814,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Barked at by dogs, and torn by brier and thorn."
23815,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23816,THE BELL OF ATRI,"One afternoon, as in that sultry clime"
23817,THE BELL OF ATRI,"It is the custom in the summer time,"
23818,THE BELL OF ATRI,"With bolted doors and window-shutters closed,"
23819,THE BELL OF ATRI,The inhabitants of Atri slept or dozed;
23820,THE BELL OF ATRI,When suddenly upon their senses fell
23821,THE BELL OF ATRI,The loud alarum of the accusing bell!
23822,THE BELL OF ATRI,"The Syndic started from his deep repose,"
23823,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Turned on his couch, and listened, and then rose"
23824,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And donned his robes, and with reluctant pace"
23825,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Went panting forth into the market-place,"
23826,THE BELL OF ATRI,Where the great bell upon its cross-beam swung
23827,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Reiterating with persistent tongue,"
23828,THE BELL OF ATRI,"In half-articulate jargon, the old song:"
23829,THE BELL OF ATRI,"""Some one hath done a wrong, hath done a wrong!"""
23830,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23831,THE BELL OF ATRI,But ere he reached the belfry's light arcade
23832,THE BELL OF ATRI,"He saw, or thought he saw, beneath its shade,"
23833,THE BELL OF ATRI,"No shape of human form of woman born,"
23834,THE BELL OF ATRI,"But a poor steed dejected and forlorn,"
23835,THE BELL OF ATRI,Who with uplifted head and eager eye
23836,THE BELL OF ATRI,Was tugging at the vines of briony.
23837,THE BELL OF ATRI,"""Domeneddio!"" cried the Syndie straight,"
23838,THE BELL OF ATRI,"""This is the Knight of Atri's steed of state!"
23839,THE BELL OF ATRI,"He calls for justice, being sore distressed,"
23840,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And pleads his cause as loudly as the best."""
23841,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23842,THE BELL OF ATRI,Meanwhile from street and lane a noisy crowd
23843,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Had rolled together like a summer cloud,"
23844,THE BELL OF ATRI,And told the story of the wretched beast
23845,THE BELL OF ATRI,"In five-and-twenty different ways at least,"
23846,THE BELL OF ATRI,With much gesticulation and appeal
23847,THE BELL OF ATRI,"To heathen gods, in their excessive zeal."
23848,THE BELL OF ATRI,The Knight was called and questioned; in reply
23849,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Did not confess the fact, did not deny;"
23850,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Treated the matter as a pleasant jest,"
23851,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And set at naught the Syndic and the rest,"
23852,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Maintaining, in an angry undertone,"
23853,THE BELL OF ATRI,That he should do what pleased him with his own.
23854,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23855,THE BELL OF ATRI,And thereupon the Syndic gravely read
23856,THE BELL OF ATRI,The proclamation of the King; then said:
23857,THE BELL OF ATRI,"""Pride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay,"
23858,THE BELL OF ATRI,"But cometh back on foot, and begs its way;"
23859,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds,"
23860,THE BELL OF ATRI,Of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds!
23861,THE BELL OF ATRI,These are familiar proverbs; but I fear
23862,THE BELL OF ATRI,They never yet have reached your knightly ear.
23863,THE BELL OF ATRI,"What fair renown, what honor, what repute"
23864,THE BELL OF ATRI,Can come to you from starving this poor brute?
23865,THE BELL OF ATRI,"He who serves well and speaks not, merits more"
23866,THE BELL OF ATRI,Than they who clamor loudest at the door.
23867,THE BELL OF ATRI,Therefore the law decrees that as this steed
23868,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Served you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed"
23869,THE BELL OF ATRI,"To comfort his old age, and to provide"
23870,THE BELL OF ATRI,"Shelter in stall an food and field beside."""
23871,THE BELL OF ATRI,
23872,THE BELL OF ATRI,The Knight withdrew abashed; the people all
23873,THE BELL OF ATRI,Led home the steed in triumph to his stall.
23874,THE BELL OF ATRI,"The King heard and approved, and laughed in glee"
23875,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And cried aloud: ""Right well it pleaseth me!"
23876,THE BELL OF ATRI,Church-bells at best but ring us to the door;
23877,THE BELL OF ATRI,But go not in to mass; my bell doth more:
23878,THE BELL OF ATRI,It cometh into court and pleads the cause
23879,THE BELL OF ATRI,Of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws;
23880,THE BELL OF ATRI,"And this shall make, in every Christian clime,"
23881,THE BELL OF ATRI,"The Bell of Atri famous for all time."""

23891,INTERLUDE,Something that is beyond the reach

23909,INTERLUDE,"The brutes that wear our form and face,"

23911,INTERLUDE,"Then paused, and waited with a frown,"

23955,KAMBALU,"By the road that leadeth to Ispahan,"
23956,KAMBALU,"At the head of his dusty caravan,"
23957,KAMBALU,"Laden with treasure from realms afar,"
23958,KAMBALU,"Baldacca and Kelat and Kandahar,"
23959,KAMBALU,Rode the great captain Alau.
23960,KAMBALU,
23961,KAMBALU,"The Khan from his palace-window gazed,"
23962,KAMBALU,"And saw in the thronging street beneath,"
23963,KAMBALU,"In the light of the setting sun, that blazed"
23964,KAMBALU,"Through the clouds of dust by the caravan raised,"
23965,KAMBALU,"The flash of harness and jewelled sheath,"
23966,KAMBALU,"And the shining scymitars of the guard,"

23969,KAMBALU,Into the shade of the palace-yard.
23970,KAMBALU,
23971,KAMBALU,Thus into the city of Kambalu
23972,KAMBALU,Rode the great captain Alau;
23973,KAMBALU,"And he stood before the Khan, and said:"
23974,KAMBALU,"""The enemies of my lord are dead;"
23975,KAMBALU,All the Kalifs of all the West
23976,KAMBALU,Bow and obey thy least behest;
23977,KAMBALU,"The plains are dark with the mulberry-trees,"
23978,KAMBALU,"The weavers are busy in Samarcand,"

23981,KAMBALU,And peace and plenty are in the land.
23982,KAMBALU,
23983,KAMBALU,"""Baldacca's Kalif, and he alone,"
23984,KAMBALU,Rose in revolt against thy throne:
23985,KAMBALU,"His treasures are at thy palace-door,"
23986,KAMBALU,With the swords and the shawls and the jewels he wore;
23987,KAMBALU,His body is dust o'er the desert blown.
23988,KAMBALU,
23989,KAMBALU,"""A mile outside of Baldacca's gate"
23990,KAMBALU,"I left my forces to lie in wait,"
23991,KAMBALU,"Concealed by forests and hillocks of sand,"
23992,KAMBALU,"And forward dashed with a handful of men,"
23993,KAMBALU,To lure the old tiger from his den
23994,KAMBALU,Into the ambush I had planned.
23995,KAMBALU,"Ere we reached the town the alarm was spread,"
23996,KAMBALU,For we heard the sound of gongs from within;
23997,KAMBALU,And with clash of cymbals and warlike din
23998,KAMBALU,The gates swung wide; and we turned and fled;
23999,KAMBALU,"And the garrison sallied forth and pursued,"
24000,KAMBALU,"With the gray old Kalif at their head,"
24001,KAMBALU,And above them the banner of Mohammed:
24002,KAMBALU,"So we snared them all, and the town was subdued."
24003,KAMBALU,
24004,KAMBALU,"""As in at the gate we rode, behold,"
24005,KAMBALU,A tower that is called the Tower of Gold!
24006,KAMBALU,"For there the Kalif had hidden his wealth,"
24007,KAMBALU,"Heaped and hoarded and piled on high,"
24008,KAMBALU,Like sacks of wheat in a granary;
24009,KAMBALU,And thither the miser crept by stealth
24010,KAMBALU,"To feel of the gold that gave him health,"
24011,KAMBALU,And to gaze and gloat with his hungry eye
24012,KAMBALU,"On jewels that gleamed like a glow-worm's spark,"
24013,KAMBALU,Or the eyes of a panther in the dark.
24014,KAMBALU,
24015,KAMBALU,"""I said to the Kalif: 'Thou art old,"
24016,KAMBALU,Thou hast no need of so much gold.
24017,KAMBALU,"Thou shouldst not have heaped and hidden it here,"
24018,KAMBALU,"Till the breath of battle was hot and near,"
24019,KAMBALU,But have sown through the land these useless hoards
24020,KAMBALU,"To spring into shining blades of swords,"
24021,KAMBALU,And keep thine honor sweet and clear.
24022,KAMBALU,These grains of gold are not grains of wheat;
24023,KAMBALU,These bars of silver thou canst not eat;
24024,KAMBALU,These jewels and pearls and precious stones
24025,KAMBALU,"Cannot cure the aches in thy bones,"
24026,KAMBALU,Nor keep the feet of Death one hour
24027,KAMBALU,From climbing the stairways of thy tower!'
24028,KAMBALU,
24029,KAMBALU,"""Then into his dungeon I locked the drone,"
24030,KAMBALU,And left him to feed there all alone
24031,KAMBALU,In the honey-cells of his golden hive:
24032,KAMBALU,"Never a prayer, nor a cry, nor a groan"
24033,KAMBALU,"Was heard from those massive walls of stone,"
24034,KAMBALU,Nor again was the Kalif seen alive!
24035,KAMBALU,
24036,KAMBALU,"""When at last we unlocked the door,"
24037,KAMBALU,We found him dead upon the floor;
24038,KAMBALU,"The rings had dropped from his withered hands,"
24039,KAMBALU,His teeth were like bones in the desert sands:
24040,KAMBALU,Still clutching his treasure he had died;
24041,KAMBALU,"And as he lay there, he appeared"
24042,KAMBALU,"A statue of gold with a silver beard,"
24043,KAMBALU,"His arms outstretched as if crucified."""

24107,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"With various melodies and rhymes,"
24108,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,That here in Hagenau there dwelt
24109,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A cobbler,--one who loved debate,"
24110,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And, arguing from a postulate,"
24111,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Would say what others only felt;
24112,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A man of forecast and of thrift,"

24121,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And some Quick Melody of the Plough,"
24122,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Or Double Harmony of the Dove,"
24123,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Was always running in his head.
24124,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"He kept, moreover, at his side,"

24126,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Reynard the Fox, the Ship of Fools,"
24127,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Or Eulenspiegel, open wide;"

24131,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"His good wife, full of godly fear,"

24163,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Of his waxed thread the stitch and rhyme.
24164,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Meanwhile his quiet little dame

24167,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Gazing impatiently to see

24170,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Along the unfrequented street,"
24171,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"With horns that blew, and drums that beat,"
24172,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And banners flying, and the flame"
24173,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Of tapers, and, at times, the sweet"
24174,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Voices of nuns; and as they sang
24175,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Suddenly all the church-bells rang.
24176,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24177,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"In a gay coach, above the crowd,"
24178,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"There sat a monk in ample hood,"
24179,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Who with his right hand held aloft
24180,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A red and ponderous cross of wood,"
24181,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,To which at times he meekly bowed.
24182,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"In front three horsemen rode, and oft,"
24183,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"With voice and air importunate,"
24184,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,A boisterous herald cried aloud:
24185,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""The grace of God is at your gate!"""
24186,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,So onward to the church they passed.
24187,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24188,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The cobbler slowly tuned his last,"
24189,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And, wagging his sagacious head,"
24190,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Unto his kneeling housewife said:
24191,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""'Tis the monk Tetzel.  I have heard"
24192,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The cawings of that reverend bird.
24193,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Don't let him cheat you of your gold;
24194,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Indulgence is not bought and sold."""
24195,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24196,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The church of Hagenau, that night,"
24197,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Was full of people, full of light;"
24198,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"An odor of incense filled the air,"
24199,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The priest intoned, the organ groaned"
24200,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Its inarticulate despair;
24201,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The candles on the altar blazed,"
24202,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And full in front of it upraised
24203,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The red cross stood against the glare.
24204,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Below, upon the altar-rail"
24205,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Indulgences were set to sale,"
24206,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Like ballads at a country fair.
24207,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A heavy strong-box, iron-bound"
24208,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And carved with many a quaint device,"
24209,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Received, with a melodious sound,"
24210,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The coin that purchased Paradise.
24211,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24212,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Then from the pulpit overhead,"
24213,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Tetzel the monk, with fiery glow,"
24214,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Thundered upon the crowd below.
24215,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""Good people all, draw near!"" he said;"
24216,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""Purchase these letters, signed and sealed,"
24217,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"By which all sins, though unrevealed"
24218,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And unrepented, are forgiven!"
24219,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Count but the gain, count not the loss"
24220,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Your gold and silver are but dross,"
24221,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And yet they pave the way to heaven.
24222,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,I hear your mothers and your sires
24223,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Cry from their purgatorial fires,"
24224,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And will ye not their ransom pay?
24225,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,O senseless people! when the gate
24226,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Of heaven is open, will ye wait?"
24227,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Will ye not enter in to-day?
24228,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,To-morrow it will be too late;
24229,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,I shall be gone upon my way.
24230,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Make haste! bring money while ye may!'
24231,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24232,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The women shuddered, and turned pale;"
24233,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Allured by hope or driven by fear,"
24234,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"With many a sob and many a tear,"
24235,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,All crowded to the altar-rail.
24236,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Pieces of silver and of gold
24237,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Into the tinkling strong-box fell
24238,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Like pebbles dropped into a well;
24239,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And soon the ballads were all sold.
24240,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The cobbler's wife among the rest
24241,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Slipped into the capacious chest
24242,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A golden florin; then withdrew,"
24243,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Hiding the paper in her breast;
24244,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And homeward through the darkness went
24245,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Comforted, quieted, content;"
24246,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"She did not walk, she rather flew,"
24247,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A dove that settles to her nest,"
24248,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,When some appalling bird of prey
24249,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,That scared her has been driven away.
24250,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24251,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The days went by, the monk was gone,"
24252,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The summer passed, the winter came;"
24253,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Though seasons changed, yet still the same"
24254,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The daily round of life went on;
24255,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The daily round of household care,"
24256,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The narrow life of toil and prayer.
24257,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,But in her heart the cobbler's dame
24258,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Had now a treasure beyond price,"
24259,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A secret joy without a name,"
24260,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The certainty of Paradise.
24261,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Alas, alas!  Dust unto dust!"
24262,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Before the winter wore away,"
24263,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Her body in the churchyard lay,"
24264,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Her patient soul was with the Just!
24265,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"After her death, among the things"
24266,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"That even the poor preserve with care,--"
24267,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Some little trinkets and cheap rings,"
24268,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A locket with her mother's hair,"
24269,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Her wedding gown, the faded flowers"
24270,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"She wore upon her wedding day,--"
24271,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Among these memories of past hours,"
24272,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"That so much of the heart reveal,"
24273,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Carefully kept and put away,"
24274,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The Letter of Indulgence lay
24275,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Folded, with signature and seal."
24276,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24277,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Meanwhile the Priest, aggrieved and pained,"
24278,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Waited and wondered that no word
24279,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Of mass or requiem he heard,"
24280,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,As by the Holy Church ordained;
24281,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Then to the Magistrate complained,"
24282,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,That as this woman had been dead
24283,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"A week or more, and no mass said,"
24284,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"It was rank heresy, or at least"
24285,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Contempt of Church; thus said the Priest;
24286,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And straight the cobbler was arraigned.
24287,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24288,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"He came, confiding in his cause,"
24289,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,But rather doubtful of the laws.
24290,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The Justice from his elbow-chair
24291,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Gave him a look that seemed to say:
24292,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""Thou standest before a Magistrate,"
24293,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Therefore do not prevaricate!"""
24294,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Then asked him in a business way,"
24295,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Kindly but cold: ""Is thy wife dead?"""
24296,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The cobbler meekly bowed his head;
24297,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""She is,"" came struggling from his throat"
24298,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Scarce audibly.  The Justice wrote
24299,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The words down in a book, and then"
24300,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Continued, as he raised his pen:"
24301,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""She is; and hath a mass been said"
24302,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,For the salvation of her soul?
24303,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Come, speak the truth! confess the whole!"""
24304,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The cobbler without pause replied:
24305,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""Of mass or prayer there was no need;"
24306,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,For at the moment when she died
24307,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Her soul was with the glorified!"""
24308,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And from his pocket with all speed
24309,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"He drew the priestly title-deed,"
24310,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And prayed the Justice he would read.
24311,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24312,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"The Justice read, amused, amazed;"
24313,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And as he read his mirth increased;
24314,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"At times his shaggy brows he raised,"
24315,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Now wondering at the cobbler gazed,"
24316,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Now archly at the angry Priest.
24317,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""From all excesses, sins, and crimes"
24318,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Thou hast committed in past times
24319,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Thee I absolve!  And furthermore,"
24320,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Purified from all earthly taints,"
24321,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,To the communion of the Saints
24322,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,And to the sacraments restore!
24323,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"All stains of weakness, and all trace"
24324,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Of shame and censure I efface;
24325,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Remit the pains thou shouldst endure,"
24326,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"And make thee innocent and pure,"
24327,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"So that in dying, unto thee"
24328,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,The gates of heaven shall open be!
24329,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Though long thou livest, yet this grace"
24330,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,Until the moment of thy death
24331,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Unchangeable continueth!"""
24332,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24333,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Then said he to the Priest: ""I find"
24334,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,This document is duly signed
24335,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Brother John Tetzel, his own hand."
24336,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,At all tribunals in the land
24337,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,In evidence it may be used;
24338,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Therefore acquitted is the accused."""
24339,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Then to the cobbler turned: ""My friend,"
24340,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Pray tell me, didst thou ever read"
24341,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"Reynard the Fox?""--""O yes, indeed!""--"
24342,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,"""I thought so.  Don't forget the end."""
24343,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24344,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24345,THE COBBLER OF HAGENAU,
24346,INTERLUDE,INTERLUDE
24347,INTERLUDE,
24348,INTERLUDE,"""What was the end?  I am ashamed"
24349,INTERLUDE,Not to remember Reynard's fate;
24350,INTERLUDE,I have not read the book of late;
24351,INTERLUDE,"Was he not hanged?"" the Poet said."
24352,INTERLUDE,"The Student gravely shook his head,"
24353,INTERLUDE,"And answered: ""You exaggerate."
24354,INTERLUDE,"There was a tournament proclaimed,"
24355,INTERLUDE,And Reynard fought with Isegrim
24356,INTERLUDE,"The Wolf, and having vanquished him,"
24357,INTERLUDE,"Rose to high honor in the State,"
24358,INTERLUDE,"And Keeper of the Seals was named!"""
24359,INTERLUDE,
24360,INTERLUDE,At this the gay Sicilian laughed:
24361,INTERLUDE,"""Fight fire with fire, and craft with craft;"
24362,INTERLUDE,Successful cunning seems to be
24363,INTERLUDE,"The moral of your tale,"" said he."
24364,INTERLUDE,"""Mine had a better, and the Jew's"
24365,INTERLUDE,"Had none at all, that I could see;"
24366,INTERLUDE,"His aim was only to amuse."""
24367,INTERLUDE,
24368,INTERLUDE,Meanwhile from out its ebon case
24369,INTERLUDE,"His violin the Minstrel drew,"
24370,INTERLUDE,"And having tuned its strings anew,"
24371,INTERLUDE,"Now held it close in his embrace,"
24372,INTERLUDE,And poising in his outstretched hand
24373,INTERLUDE,"The bow, like a magician's wand,"
24374,INTERLUDE,"He paused, and said, with beaming face:"
24375,INTERLUDE,"""Last night my story was too long;"
24376,INTERLUDE,"To-day I give you but a song,"
24377,INTERLUDE,An old tradition of the North;
24378,INTERLUDE,"But first, to put you in the mood,"
24379,INTERLUDE,"I will a little while prelude,"
24380,INTERLUDE,And from this instrument draw forth
24381,INTERLUDE,"Something by way of overture."""
24382,INTERLUDE,
24383,INTERLUDE,He played; at first the tones were pure
24384,INTERLUDE,"And tender as a summer night,"
24385,INTERLUDE,"The full moon climbing to her height,"
24386,INTERLUDE,"The sob and ripple of the seas,"
24387,INTERLUDE,The flapping of an idle sail;
24388,INTERLUDE,And then by sudden and sharp degrees
24389,INTERLUDE,"The multiplied, wild harmonies"
24390,INTERLUDE,Freshened and burst into a gale;
24391,INTERLUDE,"A tempest howling through the dark,"
24392,INTERLUDE,A crash as of some shipwrecked bark.
24393,INTERLUDE,A loud and melancholy wail.
24394,INTERLUDE,
24395,INTERLUDE,Such was the prelude to the tale
24396,INTERLUDE,Told by the Minstrel; and at times
24397,INTERLUDE,"He paused amid its varying rhymes,"
24398,INTERLUDE,And at each pause again broke in
24399,INTERLUDE,"The music of his violin,"
24400,INTERLUDE,"With tones of sweetness or of fear,"
24401,INTERLUDE,"Movements of trouble or of calm,"
24402,INTERLUDE,Creating their own atmosphere;
24403,INTERLUDE,As sitting in a church we hear
24404,INTERLUDE,Between the verses of the psalm
24405,INTERLUDE,"The organ playing soft and clear,"
24406,INTERLUDE,Or thundering on the startled ear.

24417,I,"Within the sandy bar,"
24418,I,"At sunset of a summer's day,"
24419,I,"Ready for sea, at anchor lay"
24420,I,The good ship Valdemar.
24421,I,
24422,I,"The sunbeams danced upon the waves,"
24423,I,And played along her side;
24424,I,And through the cabin windows streamed
24425,I,"In ripples of golden light, that seemed"
24426,I,The ripple of the tide.
24427,I,
24428,I,"There sat the captain with his friends,"
24429,I,"Old skippers brown and hale,"
24430,I,"Who smoked and grumbled o'er their grog,"
24431,I,"And talked of iceberg and of fog,"
24432,I,Of calm and storm and gale.
24433,I,
24434,I,And one was spinning a sailor's yarn
24435,I,"About Klaboterman,"
24436,I,The Kobold of the sea; a spright
24437,I,"Invisible to mortal sight,"
24438,I,Who o'er the rigging ran.
24439,I,
24440,I,"Sometimes he hammered in the hold,"
24441,I,"Sometimes upon the mast,"
24442,I,"Sometimes abeam, sometimes abaft,"
24443,I,"Or at the bows he sang and laughed,"
24444,I,And made all tight and fast.
24445,I,
24446,I,"He helped the sailors at their work,"
24447,I,And toiled with jovial din;
24448,I,"He helped them hoist and reef the sails,"
24449,I,"He helped them stow the casks and bales,"
24450,I,And heave the anchor in.
24451,I,
24452,I,"But woe unto the lazy louts,"
24453,I,The idlers of the crew;
24454,I,"Them to torment was his delight,"
24455,I,"And worry them by day and night,"
24456,I,And pinch them black and blue.
24457,I,
24458,I,And woe to him whose mortal eyes
24459,I,Klaboterman behold.
24460,I,It is a certain sign of death!--
24461,I,"The cabin-boy here held his breath,"
24462,I,He felt his blood run cold.

24469,II,And then again began;
24470,II,"""There is a Spectre Ship,"" quoth he,"
24471,II,"""A ship of the Dead that sails the sea,"
24472,II,And is called the Carmilhan.
24473,II,
24474,II,"""A ghostly ship, with a ghostly crew,"
24475,II,In tempests she appears;
24476,II,"And before the gale, or against the gale,"
24477,II,"She sails without a rag of sail,"
24478,II,Without a helmsman steers.
24479,II,
24480,II,"""She haunts the Atlantic north and south,"
24481,II,"But mostly the mid-sea,"
24482,II,Where three great rocks rise bleak and bare
24483,II,"Like furnace-chimneys in the air,"
24484,II,And are called the Chimneys Three.
24485,II,
24486,II,"""And ill betide the luckless ship"
24487,II,That meets the Carmilhan;
24488,II,"Over her decks the seas will leap,"
24489,II,"She must go down into the deep,"
24490,II,"And perish mouse and man."""
24491,II,
24492,II,The captain of the Valdemar
24493,II,Laughed loud with merry heart.
24494,II,"""I should like to see this ship,"" said he;"

24498,II,"""I have sailed right over the spot,"" he said"

24501,II,"You can follow my course by these pinholes here,--"
24502,II,"And never a rock could find."""
24503,II,
24504,II,"And then he swore a dreadful oath,"
24505,II,"He swore by the Kingdoms Three,"
24506,II,"That, should he meet the Carmilhan,"
24507,II,"He would run her down, although he ran"
24508,II,Right into Eternity!
24509,II,
24510,II,"All this, while passing to and fro,"
24511,II,The cabin-boy had heard;
24512,II,"He lingered at the door to hear,"
24513,II,"And drank in all with greedy ear,"
24514,II,And pondered every word.
24515,II,
24516,II,"He was a simple country lad,"
24517,II,But of a roving mind.
24518,II,"""O, it must be like heaven,"" thought he,"
24519,II,"""Those far-off foreign lands to see,"

24524,II,"He thought of home, he thought of God,"
24525,II,"And his mother under the churchyard sod,"
24526,II,And wished it were a dream.
24527,II,
24528,II,One friend on board that ship had he;
24529,II,"'T was the Klaboterman,"
24530,II,"Who saw the Bible in his chest,"
24531,II,"And made a sign upon his breast,"
24532,II,All evil things to ban.

24536,III,III

24542,III,But on the figure-head;
24543,III,
24544,III,"On Valdemar Victorious,"
24545,III,Who looketh with disdain
24546,III,To see his image in the tide
24547,III,"Dismembered float from side to side,"
24548,III,And reunite again.
24549,III,
24550,III,"""It is the wind,"" those skippers said,"

24555,III,
24556,III,"They shook the captain by the hand,"
24557,III,"""Goodluck! goodluck!"" they cried;"
24558,III,"Each face was like the setting sun,"
24559,III,"As, broad and red, they one by one"
24560,III,Went o'er the vessel's side.
24561,III,
24562,III,"The sun went down, the full moon rose,"
24563,III,Serene o'er field and flood;
24564,III,And all the winding creeks and bays
24565,III,"And broad sea-meadows seemed ablaze,"
24566,III,The sky was red as blood.
24567,III,
24568,III,"The southwest wind blew fresh and fair,"
24569,III,As fair as wind could be;
24570,III,"Bound for Odessa, o'er the bar,"
24571,III,"With all sail set, the Valdemar"
24572,III,Went proudly out to sea.
24573,III,
24574,III,The lovely moon climbs up the sky
24575,III,As one who walks in dreams;
24576,III,"A tower of marble in her light,"
24577,III,"A wall of black, a wall of white,"
24578,III,The stately vessel seems.
24579,III,
24580,III,Low down upon the sandy coast
24581,III,The lights begin to burn;
24582,III,"And now, uplifted high in air,"
24583,III,"They kindle with a fiercer glare,"
24584,III,And now drop far astern.
24585,III,
24586,III,"The dawn appears, the land is gone,"
24587,III,The sea is all around;
24588,III,Then on each hand low hills of sand
24589,III,Emerge and form another land;
24590,III,She steereth through the Sound.
24591,III,
24592,III,Through Kattegat and Skager-rack
24593,III,She flitteth like a ghost;
24594,III,"By day and night, by night and day,"
24595,III,"She bounds, she flies upon her way"
24596,III,Along the English coast.
24597,III,
24598,III,"Cape Finisterre is drawing near,"
24599,III,Cape Finisterre is past;
24600,III,Into the open ocean stream
24601,III,"She floats, the vision of a dream"
24602,III,Too beautiful to last.
24603,III,
24604,III,"Suns rise and set, and rise, and yet"
24605,III,There is no land in sight;
24606,III,The liquid planets overhead
24607,III,"Burn brighter now the moon is dead,"
24608,III,And longer stays the night.
24609,III,
24610,III,
24611,III,
24612,IV,IV
24613,IV,
24614,IV,And now along the horizon's edge
24615,IV,"Mountains of cloud uprose,"
24616,IV,"Black as with forests underneath,"
24617,IV,Above their sharp and jagged teeth
24618,IV,Were white as drifted snows.
24619,IV,
24620,IV,"Unseen behind them sank the sun,"
24621,IV,But flushed each snowy peak
24622,IV,A little while with rosy light
24623,IV,That faded slowly from the sight
24624,IV,As blushes from the cheek.
24625,IV,
24626,IV,"Black grew the sky,--all black, all black;"
24627,IV,The clouds were everywhere;
24628,IV,There was a feeling of suspense
24629,IV,"In nature, a mysterious sense"
24630,IV,Of terror in the air.
24631,IV,
24632,IV,And all on board the Valdemar
24633,IV,Was still as still could be;
24634,IV,"Save when the dismal ship-bell tolled,"
24635,IV,"As ever and anon she rolled,"
24636,IV,And lurched into the sea.
24637,IV,
24638,IV,The captain up and down the deck
24639,IV,Went striding to and fro;
24640,IV,"Now watched the compass at the wheel,"
24641,IV,Now lifted up his hand to feel
24642,IV,Which way the wind might blow.
24643,IV,
24644,IV,"And now he looked up at the sails,"
24645,IV,And now upon the deep;
24646,IV,In every fibre of his frame
24647,IV,"He felt the storm before it came,"
24648,IV,He had no thought of sleep.
24649,IV,
24650,IV,"Eight bells! and suddenly abaft,"
24651,IV,"With a great rush of rain,"
24652,IV,"Making the ocean white with spume,"
24653,IV,"In darkness like the day of doom,"
24654,IV,On came the hurricane.
24655,IV,
24656,IV,"The lightning flashed from cloud to cloud,"
24657,IV,And rent the sky in two;
24658,IV,"A jagged flame, a single jet"
24659,IV,"Of white fire, like a bayonet"
24660,IV,That pierced the eyeballs through.
24661,IV,
24662,IV,"Then all around was dark again,"
24663,IV,And blacker than before;
24664,IV,But in that single flash of light
24665,IV,"He had beheld a fearful sight,"
24666,IV,And thought of the oath he swore.
24667,IV,
24668,IV,"For right ahead lay the Ship of the Dead,"
24669,IV,The ghostly Carmilhan!
24670,IV,"Her masts were stripped, her yards were bare,"
24671,IV,"And on her bowsprit, poised in air,"
24672,IV,Sat the Klaboterman.
24673,IV,
24674,IV,Her crew of ghosts was all on deck
24675,IV,Or clambering up the shrouds;
24676,IV,"The boatswain's whistle, the captain's hail,"
24677,IV,"Were like the piping of the gale,"
24678,IV,And thunder in the clouds.
24679,IV,
24680,IV,And close behind the Carmilhan
24681,IV,"There rose up from the sea,"
24682,IV,"As from a foundered ship of stone,"
24683,IV,Three bare and splintered masts alone:
24684,IV,They were the Chimneys Three.
24685,IV,
24686,IV,And onward dashed the Valdemar
24687,IV,And leaped into the dark;
24688,IV,"A denser mist, a colder blast,"
24689,IV,"A little shudder, and she had passed"
24690,IV,Right through the Phantom Bark.
24691,IV,
24692,IV,"She cleft in twain the shadowy hulk,"
24693,IV,But cleft it unaware;
24694,IV,"As when, careering to her nest,"
24695,IV,The sea-gull severs with her breast
24696,IV,The unresisting air.
24697,IV,
24698,IV,Again the lightning flashed; again
24699,IV,"They saw the Carmilhan,"
24700,IV,Whole as before in hull and spar;
24701,IV,But now on board of the Valdemar
24702,IV,Stood the Klaboterman.
24703,IV,
24704,IV,And they all knew their doom was sealed;
24705,IV,They knew that death was near;
24706,IV,"Some prayed who never prayed before,"
24707,IV,"And some they wept, and some they swore,"
24708,IV,And some were mute with fear.
24709,IV,
24710,IV,"Then suddenly there came a shock,"
24711,IV,And louder than wind or sea
24712,IV,"A cry burst from the crew on deck,"
24713,IV,"As she dashed and crashed, a hopeless wreck,"
24714,IV,Upon the Chimneys Three.
24715,IV,
24716,IV,"The storm and night were passed, the light"
24717,IV,To streak the east began;
24718,IV,"The cabin-boy, picked up at sea,"
24719,IV,"Survived the wreck, and only he,"
24720,IV,To tell of the Carmilhan.

24725,INTERLUDE,
24726,INTERLUDE,When the long murmur of applause
24727,INTERLUDE,That greeted the Musician's lay
24728,INTERLUDE,"Had slowly buzzed itself away,"
24729,INTERLUDE,And the long talk of Spectre Ships
24730,INTERLUDE,That followed died upon their lips
24731,INTERLUDE,"And came unto a natural pause,"
24732,INTERLUDE,"""These tales you tell are one and all"
24733,INTERLUDE,"Of the Old World,"" the Poet said,"
24734,INTERLUDE,"""Flowers gathered from a crumbling wall,"
24735,INTERLUDE,Dead leaves that rustle as they fall;
24736,INTERLUDE,Let me present you in their stead
24737,INTERLUDE,"Something of our New England earth,"
24738,INTERLUDE,"A tale which, though of no great worth,"
24739,INTERLUDE,"Has still this merit, that it yields"
24740,INTERLUDE,"A certain freshness of the fields,"
24741,INTERLUDE,"A sweetness as of home-made bread."""
24742,INTERLUDE,
24743,INTERLUDE,"The Student answered: ""Be discreet;"
24744,INTERLUDE,"For if the flour be fresh and sound,"
24745,INTERLUDE,"And if the bread be light and sweet,"
24746,INTERLUDE,"Who careth in what mill 't was ground,"
24747,INTERLUDE,"Or of what oven felt the heat,"
24748,INTERLUDE,"Unless, as old Cervantes said,"
24749,INTERLUDE,You are looking after better bread
24750,INTERLUDE,Than any that is made of wheat?
24751,INTERLUDE,You know that people nowadays
24752,INTERLUDE,To what is old give little praise;
24753,INTERLUDE,All must be new in prose and verse:
24754,INTERLUDE,"They want hot bread, or something worse,"
24755,INTERLUDE,"Fresh every morning, and half baked;"
24756,INTERLUDE,"The wholesome bread of yesterday,"
24757,INTERLUDE,"Too stale for them, is thrown away,"
24758,INTERLUDE,Nor is their thirst with water slaked.
24759,INTERLUDE,
24760,INTERLUDE,As oft we see the sky in May
24761,INTERLUDE,"Threaten to rain, and yet not rain,"
24762,INTERLUDE,"The Poet's face, before so gay,"
24763,INTERLUDE,"Was clouded with a look of pain,"
24764,INTERLUDE,But suddenly brightened up again;
24765,INTERLUDE,And without further let or stay
24766,INTERLUDE,He told his tale of yesterday.

24772,LADY WENTWORTH.,LADY WENTWORTH.
24773,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24774,LADY WENTWORTH.,"One hundred years ago, and something more,"
24775,LADY WENTWORTH.,"In Queen Street, Portsmouth, at her tavern door,"
24776,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Neat as a pin, and blooming as a rose,"
24777,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Stood Mistress Stavers in her furbelows,"
24778,LADY WENTWORTH.,Just as her cuckoo-clock was striking nine.
24779,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Above her head, resplendent on the sign,"
24780,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The portrait of the Earl of Halifax,"
24781,LADY WENTWORTH.,"In scarlet coat and periwig of flax,"
24782,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Surveyed at leisure all her varied charms,"
24783,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Her cap, her bodice, her white folded arms,"
24784,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And half resolved, though he was past his prime,"
24785,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And rather damaged by the lapse of time,"
24786,LADY WENTWORTH.,To fall down at her feet and to declare
24787,LADY WENTWORTH.,The passion that had driven him to despair.
24788,LADY WENTWORTH.,For from his lofty station he had seen
24789,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Stavers, her husband, dressed in bottle-green,"
24790,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Drive his new Flying Stage-coach, four in hand,"
24791,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Down the long lane, and out into the land,"
24792,LADY WENTWORTH.,And knew that he was far upon the way
24793,LADY WENTWORTH.,To Ipswich and to Boston on the Bay!
24794,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24795,LADY WENTWORTH.,Just then the meditations of the Earl
24796,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Were interrupted by a little girl,"
24797,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Barefooted, ragged, with neglected hair,"
24798,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Eyes full of laughter, neck and shoulders bare,"
24799,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A thin slip of a girl, like a new moon,"
24800,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Sure to be rounded into beauty soon,"
24801,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A creature men would worship and adore,"
24802,LADY WENTWORTH.,Though now in mean habiliments she bore
24803,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A pail of water, dripping, through the street"
24804,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And bathing, as she went her naked feet."
24805,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24806,LADY WENTWORTH.,"It was a pretty picture, full of grace,--"
24807,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The slender form, the delicate, thin face;"
24808,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The swaying motion, as she hurried by;"
24809,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The shining feet, the laughter in her eye,"
24810,LADY WENTWORTH.,"That o'er her face in ripples gleamed and glanced,"
24811,LADY WENTWORTH.,As in her pail the shifting sunbeam danced:
24812,LADY WENTWORTH.,And with uncommon feelings of delight
24813,LADY WENTWORTH.,The Earl of Halifax beheld the sight.
24814,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Not so Dame Stavers, for he heard her say"
24815,LADY WENTWORTH.,"These words, or thought he did, as plain as day:"
24816,LADY WENTWORTH.,"""O Martha Hilton!  Fie! how dare you go"
24817,LADY WENTWORTH.,"About the town half dressed, and looking so!"""
24818,LADY WENTWORTH.,"At which the gypsy laughed, and straight replied:"
24819,LADY WENTWORTH.,"""No matter how I look; I yet shall ride"
24820,LADY WENTWORTH.,"In my own chariot, ma'am.""  And on the child"
24821,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The Earl of Halifax benignly smiled,"
24822,LADY WENTWORTH.,"As with her heavy burden she passed on,"
24823,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Looked back, then turned the corner, and was gone."
24824,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24825,LADY WENTWORTH.,"What next, upon that memorable day,"
24826,LADY WENTWORTH.,Arrested his attention was a gay
24827,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And brilliant equipage, that flashed and spun,"
24828,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The silver harness glittering in the sun,"
24829,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Outriders with red jackets, lithe and lank,"
24830,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Pounding the saddles as they rose and sank,"
24831,LADY WENTWORTH.,While all alone within the chariot sat
24832,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A portly person with three-cornered hat,"
24833,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A crimson velvet coat, head high in air,"
24834,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Gold-headed cane, and nicely powdered hair,"
24835,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And diamond buckles sparkling at his knees,"
24836,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Dignified, stately, florid, much at ease."
24837,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Onward the pageant swept, and as it passed,"
24838,LADY WENTWORTH.,Fair Mistress Stavers courtesied low and fast;
24839,LADY WENTWORTH.,"For this was Governor Wentworth, driving down"
24840,LADY WENTWORTH.,"To Little Harbor, just beyond the town,"
24841,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Where his Great House stood looking out to sea,"
24842,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A goodly place, where it was good to be."
24843,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24844,LADY WENTWORTH.,"It was a pleasant mansion, an abode"
24845,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Near and yet hidden from the great high-road,"
24846,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Sequestered among trees, a noble pile,"
24847,LADY WENTWORTH.,Baronial and colonial in its style;
24848,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Gables and dormer-windows everywhere,"
24849,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And stacks of chimneys rising high in air,--"
24850,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Pandaean pipes, on which all winds that blew"
24851,LADY WENTWORTH.,Made mournful music the whole winter through.
24852,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Within, unwonted splendors met the eye,"
24853,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Panels, and floors of oak, and tapestry;"
24854,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Carved chimney-pieces, where on brazen dogs"
24855,LADY WENTWORTH.,Revelled and roared the Christmas fires of logs;
24856,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Doors opening into darkness unawares,"
24857,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Mysterious passages, and flights of stairs;"
24858,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And on the walls, in heavy gilded frames,"
24859,LADY WENTWORTH.,The ancestral Wentworths with Old-Scripture names.
24860,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24861,LADY WENTWORTH.,Such was the mansion where the great man dwelt.
24862,LADY WENTWORTH.,A widower and childless; and he felt
24863,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The loneliness, the uncongenial gloom,"
24864,LADY WENTWORTH.,That like a presence haunted ever room;
24865,LADY WENTWORTH.,"For though not given to weakness, he could feel"
24866,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The pain of wounds, that ache because they heal."
24867,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24868,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The years came and the years went,--seven in all,"
24869,LADY WENTWORTH.,And passed in cloud and sunshine o'er the Hall;
24870,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The dawns their splendor through its chambers shed,"
24871,LADY WENTWORTH.,The sunsets flushed its western windows red;
24872,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The snow was on its roofs, the wind, the rain;"
24873,LADY WENTWORTH.,Its woodlands were in leaf and bare again;
24874,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Moons waxed and waned, the lilacs bloomed and died,"
24875,LADY WENTWORTH.,"In the broad river ebbed and flowed the tide,"
24876,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Ships went to sea, and ships came home from sea,"
24877,LADY WENTWORTH.,And the slow years sailed by and ceased to be.
24878,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24879,LADY WENTWORTH.,And all these years had Martha Hilton served
24880,LADY WENTWORTH.,"In the Great House, not wholly unobserved:"
24881,LADY WENTWORTH.,"By day, by night, the silver crescent grew,"
24882,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Though hidden by clouds, her light still shining through;"
24883,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A maid of all work, whether coarse or fine,"
24884,LADY WENTWORTH.,A servant who made service seem divine!
24885,LADY WENTWORTH.,Through her each room was fair to look upon;
24886,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The mirrors glistened, and the brasses shone,"
24887,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The very knocker on the outer door,"
24888,LADY WENTWORTH.,"If she but passed, was brighter than before."
24889,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24890,LADY WENTWORTH.,And now the ceaseless turning of the mill
24891,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Of Time, that never for an hour stands still,"
24892,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Ground out the Governor's sixtieth birthday,"
24893,LADY WENTWORTH.,And powdered his brown hair with silver-gray.
24894,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The robin, the forerunner of the spring,"
24895,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The bluebird with his jocund carolling,"
24896,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The restless swallows building in the eaves,"
24897,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The golden buttercups, the grass, the leaves,"
24898,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The lilacs tossing in the winds of May,"
24899,LADY WENTWORTH.,All welcomed this majestic holiday!
24900,LADY WENTWORTH.,"He gave a splendid banquet served on plate,"
24901,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Such as became the Governor of the State,"
24902,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Who represented England and the King,"
24903,LADY WENTWORTH.,And was magnificent in everything.
24904,LADY WENTWORTH.,"He had invited all his friends and peers,--"
24905,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The Pepperels, the Langdons, and the Lears,"
24906,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The Sparhawks, the Penhallows, and the rest;"
24907,LADY WENTWORTH.,For why repeat the name of every guest?
24908,LADY WENTWORTH.,"But I must mention one, in bands and gown,"
24909,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The rector there, the Reverend Arthur Brown"
24910,LADY WENTWORTH.,Of the Established Church; with smiling face
24911,LADY WENTWORTH.,He sat beside the Governor and said grace;
24912,LADY WENTWORTH.,"And then the feast went on, as others do,"
24913,LADY WENTWORTH.,But ended as none other I e'er knew.
24914,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24915,LADY WENTWORTH.,"When they had drunk the King, with many a cheer,"
24916,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The Governor whispered in a servant's ear,"
24917,LADY WENTWORTH.,Who disappeared and presently there stood
24918,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Within the room, in perfect womanhood,"
24919,LADY WENTWORTH.,"A maiden, modest and yet self-possessed,"
24920,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Youthful and beautiful, and simply dressed."
24921,LADY WENTWORTH.,Can this be Martha Hilton?  It must be!
24922,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Yes, Martha Hilton, and no other she!"
24923,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Dowered with the beauty of her twenty years,"
24924,LADY WENTWORTH.,"How ladylike, how queenlike she appears;"
24925,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The pale, thin crescent of the days gone by"
24926,LADY WENTWORTH.,Is Dian now in all her majesty!
24927,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Yet scarce a guest perceived that she was there,"
24928,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Until the Governor, rising from his chair,"
24929,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Played slightly with his ruffles, then looked down,"
24930,LADY WENTWORTH.,And said unto the Reverend Arthur Brown:
24931,LADY WENTWORTH.,"""This is my birthday: it shall likewise be"
24932,LADY WENTWORTH.,"My wedding-day; and you shall marry me!"""
24933,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24934,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The listening guests were greatly mystified,"
24935,LADY WENTWORTH.,"None more so than the rector, who replied:"
24936,LADY WENTWORTH.,"""Marry you?  Yes, that were a pleasant task,"
24937,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Your Excellency; but to whom? I ask."""
24938,LADY WENTWORTH.,"The Governor answered: ""To this lady here"""
24939,LADY WENTWORTH.,And beckoned Martha Hilton to draw near.
24940,LADY WENTWORTH.,"She came and stood, all blushes, at his side."
24941,LADY WENTWORTH.,The rector paused.  The impatient Governor cried:
24942,LADY WENTWORTH.,"""This is the lady; do you hesitate?"
24943,LADY WENTWORTH.,"Then I command you as Chief Magistrate."""
24944,LADY WENTWORTH.,The rector read the service loud and clear:
24945,LADY WENTWORTH.,"""Dearly beloved, we are gathered here,"""
24946,LADY WENTWORTH.,And so on to the end.  At his command
24947,LADY WENTWORTH.,On the fourth finger of her fair left hand
24948,LADY WENTWORTH.,The Governor placed the ring; and that was all:
24949,LADY WENTWORTH.,Martha was Lady Wentworth of the Hall!
24950,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24951,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24952,LADY WENTWORTH.,
24953,INTERLUDE.,INTERLUDE.
24954,INTERLUDE.,
24955,INTERLUDE.,Well pleased the audience heard the tale.
24956,INTERLUDE.,"The Theologian said: ""Indeed,"
24957,INTERLUDE.,To praise you there is little need;
24958,INTERLUDE.,One almost hears the farmers flail
24959,INTERLUDE.,"Thresh out your wheat, nor does there fail"
24960,INTERLUDE.,"A certain freshness, as you said,"
24961,INTERLUDE.,And sweetness as of home-made bread.
24962,INTERLUDE.,But not less sweet and not less fresh
24963,INTERLUDE.,"Are many legends that I know,"
24964,INTERLUDE.,"Writ by the monks of long-ago,"
24965,INTERLUDE.,"Who loved to mortify the flesh,"
24966,INTERLUDE.,"So that the soul might purer grow,"
24967,INTERLUDE.,And rise to a diviner state;
24968,INTERLUDE.,And one of these--perhaps of all
24969,INTERLUDE.,"Most beautiful--I now recall,"
24970,INTERLUDE.,And with permission will narrate;
24971,INTERLUDE.,Hoping thereby to make amends
24972,INTERLUDE.,"For that grim tragedy of mine,"
24973,INTERLUDE.,"As strong and black as Spanish wine,"
24974,INTERLUDE.,"I told last night, and wish almost"
24975,INTERLUDE.,"It had remained untold, my friends;"
24976,INTERLUDE.,For Torquemada's awful ghost
24977,INTERLUDE.,"Came to me in the dreams I dreamed,"
24978,INTERLUDE.,And in the darkness glared and gleamed
24979,INTERLUDE.,"Like a great lighthouse on the coast."""
24980,INTERLUDE.,
24981,INTERLUDE.,"The Student laughing said: ""Far more"

24994,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
24995,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Hads't thou stayed, I must have fled!"""
24996,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,That is what the Vision said.
24997,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
24998,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In his chamber all alone,"
24999,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Kneeling on the floor of stone,"
25000,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Prayed the Monk in deep contrition
25001,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"For his sins of indecision,"
25002,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Prayed for greater self-denial
25003,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,In temptation and in trial;
25004,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"It was noonday by the dial,"
25005,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And the Monk was all alone.
25006,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25007,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Suddenly, as if it lightened,"
25008,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,An unwonted splendor brightened
25009,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,All within him and without him
25010,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,In that narrow cell of stone;
25011,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And he saw the Blessed Vision
25012,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Of our Lord, with light Elysian"
25013,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Like a vesture wrapped about him,"
25014,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a garment round him thrown.
25015,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25016,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not as crucified and slain,"
25017,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not in agonies of pain,"
25018,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Not with bleeding hands and feet,"
25019,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Did the Monk his Master see;
25020,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"But as in the village street,"
25021,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In the house or harvest-field,"
25022,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Halt and lame and blind he healed,"
25023,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,When he walked in Galilee.
25024,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25025,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In an attitude imploring,"
25026,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hands upon his bosom crossed,"
25027,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Wondering, worshipping, adoring,"
25028,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Knelt the Monk in rapture lost.
25029,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,"
25030,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who am I, that thus thou deignest"
25031,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,To reveal thyself to me?
25032,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who am I, that from the centre"
25033,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Of thy glory thou shouldst enter
25034,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"This poor cell, my guest to be?"
25035,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25036,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Then amid his exaltation,"
25037,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Loud the convent bell appalling,"
25038,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
25039,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Rang through court and corridor
25040,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,With persistent iteration
25041,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,He had never heard before.
25042,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,It was now the appointed hour
25043,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When alike in shine or shower,"
25044,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Winter's cold or summer's heat,"
25045,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,To the convent portals came
25046,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"All the blind and halt and lame,"
25047,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"All the beggars of the street,"
25048,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,For their daily dole of food
25049,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Dealt them by the brotherhood;
25050,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And their almoner was he
25051,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Who upon his bended knee,"
25052,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Rapt in silent ecstasy
25053,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Of divinest self-surrender,"
25054,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Saw the Vision and the Splendor.
25055,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25056,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Deep distress and hesitation
25057,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Mingled with his adoration;
25058,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Should he go, or should he stay?"
25059,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Should he leave the poor to wait
25060,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hungry at the convent gate,"
25061,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Till the Vision passed away?
25062,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Should he slight his radiant guest,"
25063,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Slight this visitant celestial,"
25064,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"For a crowd of ragged, bestial"
25065,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Beggars at the convent gate?
25066,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Would the Vision there remain?
25067,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Would the Vision come again?
25068,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Then a voice within his breast
25069,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Whispered, audible and clear"
25070,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,As if to the outward ear:
25071,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Do thy duty; that is best;"
25072,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Leave unto thy Lord the rest!"""
25073,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25074,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Straightway to his feet he started,"
25075,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And with longing look intent
25076,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"On the Blessed Vision bent,"
25077,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Slowly from his cell departed,"
25078,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Slowly on his errand went.
25079,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25080,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"At the gate the poor were waiting,"
25081,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Looking through the iron grating,"
25082,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,With that terror in the eye
25083,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,That is only seen in those
25084,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Who amid their wants and woes
25085,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Hear the sound of doors that close,"
25086,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And of feet that pass them by;
25087,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Grown familiar with disfavor,"
25088,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Grown familiar with the savor
25089,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Of the bread by which men die!
25090,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"But to-day, they knew not why,"
25091,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like the gate of Paradise
25092,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Seemed the convent sate to rise,"
25093,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a sacrament divine
25094,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Seemed to them the bread and wine.
25095,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"In his heart the Monk was praying,"
25096,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Thinking of the homeless poor,"
25097,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,What they suffer and endure;
25098,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"What we see not, what we see;"
25099,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And the inward voice was saying:
25100,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Whatsoever thing thou doest"
25101,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"To the least of mine and lowest,"
25102,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"That thou doest unto me!"""
25103,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25104,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Unto me! but had the Vision
25105,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Come to him in beggar's clothing,"
25106,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Come a mendicant imploring,"
25107,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Would he then have knelt adoring,"
25108,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Or have listened with derision,"
25109,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And have turned away with loathing.
25110,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25111,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Thus his conscience put the question,"
25112,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Full of troublesome suggestion,"
25113,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"As at length, with hurried pace,"
25114,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Towards his cell he turned his face,"
25115,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,And beheld the convent bright
25116,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"With a supernatural light,"
25117,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Like a luminous cloud expanding
25118,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Over floor and wall and ceiling.
25119,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,
25120,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,But he paused with awe-struck feeling
25121,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"At the threshold of his door,"
25122,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,For the Vision still was standing
25123,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"As he left it there before,"
25124,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When the convent bell appalling,"
25125,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"From its belfry calling, calling,"
25126,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Summoned him to feed the poor.
25127,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,Through the long hour intervening
25128,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"It had waited his return,"
25129,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"And he felt his bosom burn,"
25130,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"Comprehending all the meaning,"
25131,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"When the Blessed Vision said,"
25132,THE LEGEND BEAUTIFUL,"""Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!"""

25142,INTERLUDE.,"Until, with ill-concealed distress"
25143,INTERLUDE.,"At all their cavilling, at last"
25144,INTERLUDE.,The Theologian gravely said:
25145,INTERLUDE.,"""The Spanish proverb, then, is right;"
25146,INTERLUDE.,"Consult your friends on what you do,"
25147,INTERLUDE.,"And one will say that it is white,"
25148,INTERLUDE.,"And others say that it is red."""
25149,INTERLUDE.,"And ""Amen!"" quoth the Spanish Jew."
25150,INTERLUDE.,
25151,INTERLUDE.,"""Six stories told!  We must have seven,"
25152,INTERLUDE.,"A cluster like the Pleiades,"

25155,INTERLUDE.,Where is the Landlord?  Bring him here;
25156,INTERLUDE.,"Let the Lost Pleiad reappear."""
25157,INTERLUDE.,
25158,INTERLUDE.,"Thus the Sicilian cried, and went"
25159,INTERLUDE.,"Forthwith to seek his missing star,"
25160,INTERLUDE.,"But did not find him in the bar,"
25161,INTERLUDE.,"A place that landlords most frequent,"
25162,INTERLUDE.,"Nor yet beside the kitchen fire,"
25163,INTERLUDE.,"Nor up the stairs, nor in the hall;"
25164,INTERLUDE.,"It was in vain to ask or call,"
25165,INTERLUDE.,There were no tidings of the Squire.

25168,INTERLUDE.,"Exclaiming: ""Well, our bashful host"

25265,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Their little game of lansquenet

25292,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Word by word, as an acolyte"
25293,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Repeats his prayers and tells his beads;
25294,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Letters full of the rolling sea,"
25295,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Full of a young man's joy to be
25296,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Abroad in the world, alone and free;"
25297,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Full of adventures and wonderful scenes
25298,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Of hunting the deer through forests vast
25299,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,In the royal grant of Pierre du Gast;
25300,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Of nights in the tents of the Tarratines;
25301,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Of Madocawando the Indian chief,"
25302,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And his daughters, glorious as queens,"
25303,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And beautiful beyond belief;
25304,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And so soft the tones of their native tongue,"
25305,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The words are not spoken, they are sung!"
25306,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25307,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And the Curate listens, and smiling says:"
25308,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"""Ah yes, dear friend! in our young days"
25309,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,We should have liked to hunt the deer
25310,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"All day amid those forest scenes,"
25311,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And to sleep in the tents of the Tarratines;
25312,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,But now it is better sitting here
25313,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Within four walls, and without the fear"
25314,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Of losing our hearts to Indian queens;
25315,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"For man is fire and woman is tow,"
25316,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And the Somebody comes and begins to blow."""

25320,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Glimmers and vanishes again;
25321,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"But naught he answers; he only sighs,"
25322,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And for a moment bows his head;
25323,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Then, as their custom is, they play"
25324,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Their little gain of lansquenet,"
25325,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And another day is with the dead.
25326,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25327,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Another day, and many a day"
25328,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And many a week and month depart,"

25330,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Across the sea, like a bird of prey,"
25331,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And strikes and tears the old man's heart.
25332,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Lo! the young Baron of St. Castine,"
25333,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Swift as the wind is, and as wild,"
25334,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Has married a dusky Tarratine,"
25335,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Has married Madocawando's child!
25336,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25337,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The letter drops from the father's hand;
25338,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Though the sinews of his heart are wrung,"
25339,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"He utters no cry, he breathes no prayer,"
25340,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,No malediction falls from his tongue;
25341,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"But his stately figure, erect and grand,"
25342,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Bends and sinks like a column of sand
25343,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,In the whirlwind of his great despair.
25344,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Dying, yes, dying!  His latest breath"

25346,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Is a blessing on his wayward son.
25347,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Lower and lower on his breast
25348,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Sinks his gray head; he is at rest;
25349,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,No longer he waits for any one;
25350,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25351,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,For many a year the old chateau
25352,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Lies tenantless and desolate;
25353,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Rank grasses in the courtyard grow,"
25354,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,About its gables caws the crow;
25355,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Only the porter at the gate
25356,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Is left to guard it, and to wait"
25357,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The coming of the rightful heir;
25358,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,No other life or sound is there;
25359,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"No more the Curate comes at night,"
25360,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"No more is seen the unsteady light,"
25361,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Threading the alleys of the park;
25362,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The windows of the hall are dark,"
25363,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The chambers dreary, cold, and bare!"
25364,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25365,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"At length, at last, when the winter is past,"
25366,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And birds are building, and woods are green,"
25367,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,With flying skirts is the Curate seen
25368,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Speeding along the woodland way,"
25369,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Humming gayly, ""No day is so long"
25370,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"But it comes at last to vesper-song."""
25371,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,He stops at the porter's lodge to say
25372,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,That at last the Baron of St. Castine
25373,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Is coming home with his Indian queen,"
25374,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Is coming without a week's delay;
25375,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And all the house must be swept and clean,"
25376,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And all things set in good array!
25377,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And the solemn porter shakes his head;
25378,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And the answer he makes is: ""Lackaday!"
25379,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"We will see, as the blind man said!"""
25380,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25381,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Alert since first the day began,"
25382,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The cock upon the village church
25383,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Looks northward from his airy perch,"
25384,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,As if beyond the ken of man
25385,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"To see the ships come sailing on,"
25386,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And pass the isle of Oleron,"
25387,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And pass the Tower of Cordouan.
25388,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25389,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,In the church below is cold in clay
25390,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The heart that would have leaped for joy--
25391,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,O tender heart of truth and trust!--
25392,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,To see the coming of that day;
25393,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,In the church below the lips are dust;
25394,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Dust are the hands, and dust the feet,"
25395,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,That would have been so swift to meet
25396,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The coming of that wayward boy.
25397,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25398,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,At night the front of the old chateau
25399,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Is a blaze of light above and below;
25400,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"There's a sound of wheels and hoofs in the street,"
25401,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"A cracking of whips, and scamper of feet,"
25402,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Bells are ringing, and horns are blown,"
25403,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And the Baron hath come again to his own.
25404,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The Curate is waiting in the hall,"
25405,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Most eager and alive of all
25406,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,To welcome the Baron and Baroness;
25407,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"But his mind is full of vague distress,"
25408,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,For he hath read in Jesuit books
25409,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Of those children of the wilderness,"
25410,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And now, good, simple man! he looks"
25411,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,To see a painted savage stride
25412,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Into the room, with shoulders bare,"
25413,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And eagle feathers in her hair,"
25414,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And around her a robe of panther's hide.
25415,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25416,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Instead, he beholds with secret shame"
25417,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"A form of beauty undefined,"
25418,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"A loveliness with out a name,"
25419,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Not of degree, but more of kind;"
25420,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Nor bold nor shy, nor short nor tall,"
25421,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,But a new mingling of them all.
25422,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Yes, beautiful beyond belief,"
25423,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Transfigured and transfused, he sees"
25424,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The lady of the Pyrenees,"
25425,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The daughter of the Indian chief.
25426,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25427,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Beneath the shadow of her hair
25428,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The gold-bronze color of the skin
25429,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Seems lighted by a fire within,"
25430,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,As when a burst of sunlight shines
25431,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Beneath a sombre grove of pines,--"
25432,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,A dusky splendor in the air.
25433,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The two small hands, that now are pressed"
25434,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"In his, seem made to be caressed,"
25435,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"They lie so warm and soft and still,"
25436,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Like birds half hidden in a nest,"
25437,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Trustful, and innocent of ill."
25438,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And ah! he cannot believe his ears
25439,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,When her melodious voice he hears
25440,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Speaking his native Gascon tongue;
25441,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The words she utters seem to be
25442,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Part of some poem of Goudouli,"
25443,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"They are not spoken, they are sung!"
25444,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And the Baron smiles, and says, ""You see,"
25445,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,I told you but the simple truth;
25446,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"Ah, you may trust the eyes of youth!"""
25447,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25448,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,Down in the village day by day
25449,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The people gossip in their way,"
25450,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And stare to see the Baroness pass
25451,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,On Sunday morning to early Mass;
25452,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And when she kneeleth down to pray,"
25453,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"They wonder, and whisper together, and say,"
25454,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"""Surely this is no heathen lass!"""
25455,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And in course of time they learn to bless
25456,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,The Baron and the Baroness.
25457,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,
25458,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,And in course of time the Curate learns
25459,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"A secret so dreadful, that by turns"
25460,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"He is ice and fire, he freezes and burns."
25461,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"The Baron at confession hath said,"
25462,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"That though this woman be his wife,"
25463,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"He bath wed her as the Indians wed,"
25464,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,He hath bought her for a gun and a knife!

25476,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"And the worse, the nearer they are to mend."
25477,THE BARON OF ST. CASTINE,"For the sake of the living and the dead,"

25769,CHARLEMAGNE,"Olger the Dane and Desiderio,"
25770,CHARLEMAGNE,"King of the Lombards, on a lofty tower"
25771,CHARLEMAGNE,"Stood gazing northward o'er the rolling plains,"
25772,CHARLEMAGNE,"League after league of harvests, to the foot"
25773,CHARLEMAGNE,"Of the snow-crested Alps, and saw approach"
25774,CHARLEMAGNE,"A mighty army, thronging all the roads"
25775,CHARLEMAGNE,That led into the city.  And the King
25776,CHARLEMAGNE,"Said unto Olger, who had passed his youth"
25777,CHARLEMAGNE,"As hostage at the court of France, and knew"
25778,CHARLEMAGNE,"The Emperor's form and face ""Is Charlemagne"
25779,CHARLEMAGNE,"Among that host?""  And Olger answered: ""No."""
25780,CHARLEMAGNE,
25781,CHARLEMAGNE,And still the innumerable multitude
25782,CHARLEMAGNE,"Flowed onward and increased, until the King"
25783,CHARLEMAGNE,"Cried in amazement: ""Surely Charlemagne"
25784,CHARLEMAGNE,"Is coming in the midst of all these knights!"""
25785,CHARLEMAGNE,"And Olger answered slowly: ""No; not yet;"
25786,CHARLEMAGNE,"He will not come so soon.""  Then much disturbed"
25787,CHARLEMAGNE,"King Desiderio asked: ""What shall we do,"
25788,CHARLEMAGNE,"if he approach with a still greater army!"""
25789,CHARLEMAGNE,"And Olger answered: ""When he shall appear,"
25790,CHARLEMAGNE,You will behold what manner of man he is;
25791,CHARLEMAGNE,"But what will then befall us I know not."""
25792,CHARLEMAGNE,
25793,CHARLEMAGNE,"Then came the guard that never knew repose,"
25794,CHARLEMAGNE,The Paladins of France; and at the sight
25795,CHARLEMAGNE,The Lombard King o'ercome with terror cried:
25796,CHARLEMAGNE,"""This must be Charlemagne!"" and as before"
25797,CHARLEMAGNE,"Did Olger answer: ""No; not yet, not yet."""
25798,CHARLEMAGNE,
25799,CHARLEMAGNE,And then appeared in panoply complete
25800,CHARLEMAGNE,The Bishops and the Abbots and the Priests
25801,CHARLEMAGNE,"Of the imperial chapel, and the Counts"
25802,CHARLEMAGNE,And Desiderio could no more endure
25803,CHARLEMAGNE,"The light of day, nor yet encounter death,"
25804,CHARLEMAGNE,"But sobbed aloud and said: ""Let us go down"
25805,CHARLEMAGNE,"And hide us in the bosom of the earth,"
25806,CHARLEMAGNE,Far from the sight and anger of a foe
25807,CHARLEMAGNE,"So terrible as this!""  And Olger said:"
25808,CHARLEMAGNE,"""When you behold the harvests in the fields"
25809,CHARLEMAGNE,"Shaking with fear, the Po and the Ticino"
25810,CHARLEMAGNE,"Lashing the city walls with iron waves,"
25811,CHARLEMAGNE,Then may you know that Charlemagne is come.
25812,CHARLEMAGNE,"And even as he spake, in the northwest,"
25813,CHARLEMAGNE,"Lo! there uprose a black and threatening cloud,"
25814,CHARLEMAGNE,Out of whose bosom flashed the light of arms
25815,CHARLEMAGNE,Upon the people pent up in the city;
25816,CHARLEMAGNE,A light more terrible than any darkness;
25817,CHARLEMAGNE,And Charlemagne appeared;--a Man of Iron!
25818,CHARLEMAGNE,
25819,CHARLEMAGNE,"His helmet was of iron, and his gloves"
25820,CHARLEMAGNE,"Of iron, and his breastplate and his greaves"
25821,CHARLEMAGNE,"And tassets were of iron, and his shield."
25822,CHARLEMAGNE,"In his left hand he held an iron spear,"
25823,CHARLEMAGNE,In his right hand his sword invincible.
25824,CHARLEMAGNE,"The horse he rode on had the strength of iron,"
25825,CHARLEMAGNE,And color of iron.  All who went before him
25826,CHARLEMAGNE,"Beside him and behind him, his whole host,"
25827,CHARLEMAGNE,"Were armed with iron, and their hearts within them"
25828,CHARLEMAGNE,Were stronger than the armor that they wore.
25829,CHARLEMAGNE,"The fields and all the roads were filled with iron,"
25830,CHARLEMAGNE,And points of iron glistened in the sun
25831,CHARLEMAGNE,And shed a terror through the city streets.
25832,CHARLEMAGNE,
25833,CHARLEMAGNE,This at a single glance Olger the Dane
25834,CHARLEMAGNE,"Saw from the tower, and turning to the King"
25835,CHARLEMAGNE,"Exclaimed in haste: ""Behold! this is the man"
25836,CHARLEMAGNE,"You looked for with such eagerness!"" and then"
25837,CHARLEMAGNE,Fell as one dead at Desiderio's feet.

25843,INTERLUDE,"Well pleased all listened to the tale,"
25844,INTERLUDE,"That drew, the Student said, its pith"
25845,INTERLUDE,And marrow from the ancient myth
25846,INTERLUDE,Of some one with an iron flail;
25847,INTERLUDE,Or that portentous Man of Brass
25848,INTERLUDE,"Hephæstus made in days of yore,"
25849,INTERLUDE,"Who stalked about the Cretan shore,"
25850,INTERLUDE,"And saw the ships appear and pass,"
25851,INTERLUDE,"And threw stones at the Argonauts,"
25852,INTERLUDE,Being filled with indiscriminate ire
25853,INTERLUDE,That tangled and perplexed his thoughts;
25854,INTERLUDE,"But, like a hospitable host,"
25855,INTERLUDE,"When strangers landed on the coast,"
25856,INTERLUDE,"Heated himself red-hot with fire,"
25857,INTERLUDE,"And hugged them in his arms, and pressed"
25858,INTERLUDE,Their bodies to his burning breast.
25859,INTERLUDE,
25860,INTERLUDE,"The Poet answered: ""No, not thus"
25861,INTERLUDE,The legend rose; it sprang at first
25862,INTERLUDE,Out of the hunger and the thirst
25863,INTERLUDE,In all men for the marvellous.
25864,INTERLUDE,And thus it filled and satisfied
25865,INTERLUDE,"The imagination of mankind,"
25866,INTERLUDE,And this ideal to the mind
25867,INTERLUDE,Was truer than historic fact.
25868,INTERLUDE,Fancy enlarged and multiplied
25869,INTERLUDE,The tenors of the awful name
25870,INTERLUDE,"Of Charlemagne, till he became"
25871,INTERLUDE,"Armipotent in every act,"
25872,INTERLUDE,"And, clothed in mystery, appeared"
25873,INTERLUDE,"Not what men saw, but what they feared."
25874,INTERLUDE,"Besides, unless my memory fail,"
25875,INTERLUDE,Your some one with an iron flail
25876,INTERLUDE,"Is not an ancient myth at all,"
25877,INTERLUDE,But comes much later on the scene
25878,INTERLUDE,"As Talus in the Faerie Queene,"
25879,INTERLUDE,"The iron groom of Artegall,"
25880,INTERLUDE,"Who threshed out falsehood and deceit,"
25881,INTERLUDE,"And truth upheld, and righted wrong,"
25882,INTERLUDE,"As was, as is the swallow, fleet,"

25889,INTERLUDE,Of Artaxerxes to the fight;
25890,INTERLUDE,"At first the low gray cloud of dust,"
25891,INTERLUDE,And then a blackness o'er the fields
25892,INTERLUDE,"As of a passing thunder-gust,"
25893,INTERLUDE,"Then flash of brazen armor bright,"
25894,INTERLUDE,"And ranks of men, and spears up-thrust,"
25895,INTERLUDE,"Bowmen and troops with wicker shields,"

26065,EMMA AND EGINHARD,The Emperor saw his daughter Emma's face!
26066,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26067,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"He started not; he did not speak or moan,"
26068,EMMA AND EGINHARD,But seemed as one who hath been turned to stone;
26069,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And stood there like a statue, nor awoke"
26070,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Out of his trance of pain, till morning broke,"
26071,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Till the stars faded, and the moon went down,"
26072,EMMA AND EGINHARD,And o'er the towers and steeples of the town
26073,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Came the gray daylight; then the sun, who took"
26074,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"The empire of the world with sovereign look,"
26075,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Suffusing with a soft and golden glow
26076,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"All the dead landscape in its shroud of snow,"
26077,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Touching with flame the tapering chapel spires,"
26078,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Windows and roofs, and smoke of household fires,"
26079,EMMA AND EGINHARD,And kindling park and palace as he came;
26080,EMMA AND EGINHARD,The stork's nest on the chimney seemed in flame.
26081,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And thus he stood till Eginhard appeared,"
26082,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Demure and modest with his comely beard
26083,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And flowing flaxen tresses, come to ask,"
26084,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"As was his wont, the day's appointed task."
26085,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26086,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"The Emperor looked upon him with a smile,"
26087,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And gently said: ""My son, wait yet awhile;"
26088,EMMA AND EGINHARD,This hour my council meets upon some great
26089,EMMA AND EGINHARD,And very urgent business of the state.
26090,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Come back within the hour.  On thy return
26091,EMMA AND EGINHARD,The work appointed for thee shalt thou learn.
26092,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26093,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Having dismissed this gallant Troubadour,"
26094,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"He summoned straight his council, and secure"
26095,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And steadfast in his purpose, from the throne"
26096,EMMA AND EGINHARD,All the adventure of the night made known;
26097,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Then asked for sentence; and with eager breath
26098,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Some answered banishment, and others death."
26099,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26100,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Then spake the king: ""Your sentence is not mine;"
26101,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Life is the gift of God, and is divine;"
26102,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Nor from these palace walls shall one depart
26103,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Who carries such a secret in his heart;
26104,EMMA AND EGINHARD,My better judgment points another way.
26105,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Good Alcuin, I remember how one day"
26106,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"When my Pepino asked you, 'What are men?'"
26107,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"You wrote upon his tablets with your pen,"
26108,EMMA AND EGINHARD,'Guests of the grave and travellers that pass!'
26109,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"This being true of all men, we, alas!"
26110,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Being all fashioned of the selfsame dust,"
26111,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Let us be merciful as well as just;
26112,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"This passing traveller, who hath stolen away"
26113,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"The brightest jewel of my crown to-day,"
26114,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Shall of himself the precious gem restore;
26115,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"By giving it, I make it mine once more."
26116,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Over those fatal footprints I will throw
26117,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"My ermine mantle like another snow."""
26118,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26119,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Then Eginhard was summoned to the hall,"
26120,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And entered, and in presence of them all,"
26121,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"The Emperor said: ""My son, for thou to me"
26122,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Hast been a son, and evermore shalt be,"
26123,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Long hast thou served thy sovereign, and thy zeal"
26124,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Pleads to me with importunate appeal,"
26125,EMMA AND EGINHARD,While I have been forgetful to requite
26126,EMMA AND EGINHARD,Thy service and affection as was right.
26127,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"But now the hour is come, when I, thy Lord,"
26128,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Will crown thy love with such supreme reward,"
26129,EMMA AND EGINHARD,A gift so precious kings have striven in vain
26130,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"To win it from the hands of Charlemagne."""
26131,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26132,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Then sprang the portals of the chamber wide,"
26133,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And Princess Emma entered, in the pride"
26134,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Of birth and beauty, that in part o'er-came"
26135,EMMA AND EGINHARD,The conscious terror and the blush of shame.
26136,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And the good Emperor rose up from his throne,"
26137,EMMA AND EGINHARD,And taking her white hand within his own
26138,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Placed it in Eginhard's, and said: ""My son"
26139,EMMA AND EGINHARD,This is the gift thy constant zeal hath won;
26140,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"Thus I repay the royal debt I owe,"
26141,EMMA AND EGINHARD,"And cover up the footprints in the snow."""

26144,EMMA AND EGINHARD,
26145,INTERLUDE,INTERLUDE
26146,INTERLUDE,
26147,INTERLUDE,Thus ran the Student's pleasant rhyme
26148,INTERLUDE,Of Eginhard and love and youth;
26149,INTERLUDE,"Some doubted its historic truth,"
26150,INTERLUDE,"But while they doubted, ne'ertheless"
26151,INTERLUDE,"Saw in it gleams of truthfulness,"
26152,INTERLUDE,And thanked the Monk of Lauresheim.
26153,INTERLUDE,
26154,INTERLUDE,This they discussed in various mood;
26155,INTERLUDE,Then in the silence that ensued
26156,INTERLUDE,Was heard a sharp and sudden sound
26157,INTERLUDE,As of a bowstring snapped in air;
26158,INTERLUDE,And the Musician with a bound
26159,INTERLUDE,"Sprang up in terror from his chair,"
26160,INTERLUDE,"And for a moment listening stood,"
26161,INTERLUDE,"Then strode across the room, and found"
26162,INTERLUDE,"His dear, his darling violin"
26163,INTERLUDE,Still lying safe asleep within
26164,INTERLUDE,"Its little cradle, like a child"
26165,INTERLUDE,"That gives a sudden cry of pain,"
26166,INTERLUDE,And wakes to fall asleep again;
26167,INTERLUDE,"And as he looked at it and smiled,"
26168,INTERLUDE,"By the uncertain light beguiled,"
26169,INTERLUDE,Despair! two strings were broken in twain.
26170,INTERLUDE,
26171,INTERLUDE,"While all lamented and made moan,"
26172,INTERLUDE,With many a sympathetic word
26173,INTERLUDE,"As if the loss had been their own,"
26174,INTERLUDE,Deeming the tones they might have heard
26175,INTERLUDE,"Sweeter than they had heard before,"
26176,INTERLUDE,"They saw the Landlord at the door,"
26177,INTERLUDE,"The missing man, the portly Squire!"
26178,INTERLUDE,"He had not entered, but he stood"
26179,INTERLUDE,"With both arms full of seasoned wood,"
26180,INTERLUDE,"To feed the much-devouring fire,"
26181,INTERLUDE,That like a lion in a cage
26182,INTERLUDE,Lashed its long tail and roared with rage.
26183,INTERLUDE,
26184,INTERLUDE,"The missing man!  Ah, yes, they said,"
26185,INTERLUDE,"Missing, but whither had he fled?"
26186,INTERLUDE,Where had he hidden himself away?
26187,INTERLUDE,No farther than the barn or shed;
26188,INTERLUDE,"He had not hidden himself, nor fled;"
26189,INTERLUDE,How should he pass the rainy day
26190,INTERLUDE,"But in his barn with hens and hay,"
26191,INTERLUDE,"Or mending harness, cart, or sled?"
26192,INTERLUDE,"Now, having come, he needs must stay"
26193,INTERLUDE,And tell his tale as well as they.
26194,INTERLUDE,
26195,INTERLUDE,"The Landlord answered only: ""These"
26196,INTERLUDE,Are logs from the dead apple-trees
26197,INTERLUDE,Of the old orchard planted here
26198,INTERLUDE,By the first Howe of Sudbury.
26199,INTERLUDE,Nor oak nor maple has so clear
26200,INTERLUDE,"A flame, or burns so quietly,"
26201,INTERLUDE,"Or leaves an ash so clean and white"";"
26202,INTERLUDE,Thinking by this to put aside
26203,INTERLUDE,The impending tale that terrified;
26204,INTERLUDE,"When suddenly, to his delight,"
26205,INTERLUDE,"The Theologian interposed,"
26206,INTERLUDE,"Saying that when the door was closed,"
26207,INTERLUDE,"And they had stopped that draft of cold,"
26208,INTERLUDE,"Unpleasant night air, he proposed"
26209,INTERLUDE,To tell a tale world-wide apart
26210,INTERLUDE,From that the Student had just told;
26211,INTERLUDE,"World-wide apart, and yet akin,"
26212,INTERLUDE,As showing that the human heart
26213,INTERLUDE,"Beats on forever as of old,"
26214,INTERLUDE,As well beneath the snow-white fold
26215,INTERLUDE,"Of Quaker kerchief, as within"
26216,INTERLUDE,"Sendal or silk or cloth of gold,"
26217,INTERLUDE,And without preface would begin.
26218,INTERLUDE,
26219,INTERLUDE,"And then the clamorous clock struck eight,"
26220,INTERLUDE,"Deliberate, with sonorous chime"
26221,INTERLUDE,"Slow measuring out the march of time,"
26222,INTERLUDE,Like some grave Consul of old Rome
26223,INTERLUDE,In Jupiter's temple driving home
26224,INTERLUDE,The nails that marked the year and date.
26225,INTERLUDE,"Thus interrupted in his rhyme,"
26226,INTERLUDE,The Theologian needs must wait;
26227,INTERLUDE,"But quoted Horace, where he sings"
26228,INTERLUDE,"The dire Necessity of things,"
26229,INTERLUDE,That drives into the roofs sublime
26230,INTERLUDE,Of new-built houses of the great
26231,INTERLUDE,The adamantine nails of Fate.
26232,INTERLUDE,
26233,INTERLUDE,When ceased the little carillon
26234,INTERLUDE,To herald from its wooden tower
26235,INTERLUDE,"The important transit of the hour,"
26236,INTERLUDE,"The Theologian hastened on,"
26237,INTERLUDE,Content to be all owed at last
26238,INTERLUDE,To sing his Idyl of the Past.

26245,ELIZABETH,
26246,I,I
26247,I,
26248,I,"""Ah, how short are the days!  How soon the night overtakes us!"
26249,I,In the old country the twilight is longer; but here in the forest
26250,I,"Suddenly comes the dark, with hardly a pause in its coming,"
26251,I,"Hardly a moment between the two lights, the day and the lamplight;"
26252,I,"Yet how grand is the winter!  How spotless the snow is, and perfect!"""
26253,I,
26254,I,"Thus spake Elizabeth Haddon at nightfall to Hannah the housemaid,"
26255,I,"As in the farm-house kitchen, that served for kitchen and parlor,"
26256,I,"By the window she sat with her work, and looked on a landscape"
26257,I,"White as the great white sheet that Peter saw in his vision,"
26258,I,By the four corners let down and descending out of the heavens.
26259,I,"Covered with snow were the forests of pine, and the fields and the meadows."
26260,I,"Nothing was dark but the sky, and the distant Delaware flowing"
26261,I,"Down from its native hills, a peaceful and bountiful river."
26262,I,
26263,I,Then with a smile on her lips made answer Hannah the housemaid:
26264,I,"""Beautiful winter! yea, the winter is beautiful, surely,"
26265,I,If one could only walk like a fly with one's feet on the ceiling.
26266,I,"But the great Delaware River is not like the Thames, as we saw it"
26267,I,"Out of our upper windows in Rotherhithe Street in the Borough,"
26268,I,Crowded with masts and sails of vessels coming and going;
26269,I,"Here there is nothing but pines, with patches of snow on their branches."
26270,I,"There is snow in the air, and see! it is falling already;"
26271,I,"All the roads will be blocked, and I pity Joseph to-morrow,"
26272,I,"Breaking his way through the drifts, with his sled and oxen; and then, too,"
26273,I,"How in all the world shall we get to Meeting on First-Day?"""
26274,I,
26275,I,"But Elizabeth checked her, and answered, mildly reproving:"
26276,I,"""Surely the Lord will provide; for unto the snow he sayeth,"
26277,I,"Be thou on the earth, the good Lord sayeth; he is it"
26278,I,"Giveth snow like wool, like ashes scatters the hoar-frost."""
26279,I,So she folded her work and laid it away in her basket.
26280,I,
26281,I,"Meanwhile Hannah the housemaid had closed and fastened the shutters,"
26282,I,"Spread the cloth, and lighted the lamp on the table, and placed there"
26283,I,"Plates and cups from the dresser, the brown rye loaf, and the butter"
26284,I,"Fresh from the dairy, and then, protecting her hand with a holder,"
26285,I,"Took from the crane in the chimney the steaming and simmering kettle,"
26286,I,"Poised it aloft in the air, and filled up the earthen teapot,"
26287,I,"Made in Delft, and adorned with quaint and wonderful figures."
26288,I,
26289,I,"Then Elizabeth said, ""Lo! Joseph is long on his errand."
26290,I,I have sent him away with a hamper of food and of clothing
26291,I,For the poor in the village.  A good lad and cheerful is Joseph;
26292,I,"In the right place is his heart, and his hand is ready and willing."""
26293,I,
26294,I,"Thus in praise of her servant she spake, and Hannah the housemaid"
26295,I,"Laughed with her eyes, as she listened, but governed her tongue, and was silent,"
26296,I,"While her mistress went on: ""The house is far from the village;"
26297,I,"We should be lonely here, were it not for Friends that in passing"
26298,I,"Sometimes tarry o'ernight, and make us glad by their coming."""
26299,I,
26300,I,"Thereupon answered Hannah the housemaid, the thrifty, the frugal:"
26301,I,"""Yea, they come and they tarry, as if thy house were a tavern;"
26302,I,"Open to all are its doors, and they come and go like the pigeons"
26303,I,"In and out of the holes of the pigeon-house over the hayloft,"
26304,I,"Cooing and smoothing their feathers and basking themselves in the sunshine."""
26305,I,
26306,I,"But in meekness of spirit, and calmly, Elizabeth answered:"
26307,I,"""All I have is the Lord's, not mine to give or withhold it;"
26308,I,"I but distribute his gifts to the poor, and to those of his people"
26309,I,Who in journeyings often surrender their lives to his service.
26310,I,"His, not mine, are the gifts, and only so far can I make them"
26311,I,"Mine, as in giving I add my heart to whatever is given."
26312,I,Therefore my excellent father first built this house in the clearing;
26313,I,"Though he came not himself, I came; for the Lord was my guidance,"
26314,I,"Leading me here for this service.  We must not grudge, then, to others"
26315,I,"Ever the cup of cold water, or crumbs that fall from our table."""
26316,I,
26317,I,"Thus rebuked, for a season was silent the penitent housemaid;"
26318,I,And Elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer:
26319,I,"""Dost thou remember, Hannah, the great May-Meeting in London,"
26320,I,"When I was still a child, how we sat in the silent assembly,"
26321,I,Waiting upon the Lord in patient and passive submission?
26322,I,"No one spake, till at length a young man, a stranger, John Estaugh,"
26323,I,"Moved by the Spirit, rose, as if he were John the Apostle,"
26324,I,"Speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts, as a strong wind"
26325,I,"Bends the grass of the fields, or grain that is ripe for the sickle."
26326,I,"Thoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me,"
26327,I,Wherefore I do not know; but strong is the feeling within me
26328,I,"That once more I shall see a face I have never forgotten."""
26329,I,
26330,I,
26331,II,II
26332,II,
26333,II,"E'en as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleigh-bells,"
26334,II,"First far off, with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance,"
26335,II,"Then growing nearer and louder, and turning into the farmyard,"
26336,II,"Till it stopped at the door, with sudden creaking of runners."
26337,II,"Then there were voices heard as of two men talking together,"
26338,II,"And to herself, as she listened, upbraiding said Hannah the housemaid,"
26339,II,"""It is Joseph come back, and I wonder what stranger is with him?"""
26340,II,
26341,II,Down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern
26342,II,"Pierced with holes, and round, and roofed like the top of a lighthouse,"
26343,II,"And went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway,"
26344,II,Casting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow
26345,II,"Over the falling snow, the yellow sleigh, and the horses,"
26346,II,"And the forms of men, snow-covered, looming gigantic."
26347,II,"Then giving Joseph the lantern, she entered the house with the stranger."
26348,II,"Youthful he was and tall, and his cheeks aglow with the night air;"
26349,II,"And as he entered, Elizabeth rose, and, going to meet him,"
26350,II,"As if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence,"
26351,II,"And he had come as one whose coming had long been expected,"
26352,II,"Quietly gave him her hand, and said, ""Thou art welcome, John Estaugh."""
26353,II,"And the stranger replied, with staid and quiet behavior,"
26354,II,"""Dost thou remember me still, Elizabeth?  After so many"
26355,II,"Years have passed, it seemeth a wonderful thing that I find thee."
26356,II,Surely the hand of the Lord conducted me here to thy threshold.
26357,II,"For as I journeyed along, and pondered alone and in silence"
26358,II,"On his ways, that are past finding out, I saw in the snow-mist,"
26359,II,"Seemingly weary with travel, a wayfarer, who by the wayside"
26360,II,"Paused and waited.  Forthwith I remembered Queen Candace's eunuch,"
26361,II,"How on the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,"
26362,II,"Reading Esaias the Prophet, he journeyed, and spake unto Philip,"
26363,II,Praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him.
26364,II,"So I greeted the man, and he mounted the sledge beside me,"
26365,II,"And as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead,"
26366,II,"How, being led by the light of the Spirit, that never deceiveth,"
26367,II,"Full of zeal for the work of the Lord, thou hadst come to this country."
26368,II,"And I remembered thy name, and thy father and mother in England,"
26369,II,"And on my journey have stopped to see thee, Elizabeth Haddon."
26370,II,"Wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing."""
26371,II,
26372,II,"And Elizabeth answered with confident voice, and serenely"
26373,II,"Looking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered,"
26374,II,"""Surely the hand of the Lord is in it; his Spirit hath led thee"
26375,II,"Out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside."""
26376,II,
26377,II,"Then, with stamping of feet, the door was opened, and Joseph"
26378,II,"Entered, bearing the lantern, and, carefully blowing the light out,"
26379,II,"Rung it up on its nail, and all sat down to their supper;"
26380,II,"For underneath that roof was no distinction of persons,"
26381,II,"But one family only, one heart, one hearth and one household."
26382,II,
26383,II,"When the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace,"
26384,II,"Spacious, open-hearted, profuse of flame and of firewood,"
26385,II,"Lord of forests unfelled, and not a gleaner of fagots,"
26386,II,Spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty
26387,II,"All who fled from the cold, exultant, laughing at winter!"
26388,II,"Only Hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table,"
26389,II,"Coming and going, and hustling about in closet and chamber."
26390,II,
26391,II,"Then Elizabeth told her story again to John Estaugh,"
26392,II,"Going far back to the past, to the early days of her childhood;"
26393,II,"How she had waited and watched, in all her doubts and besetments"
26394,II,"Comforted with the extendings and holy, sweet inflowings"
26395,II,"Of the spirit of love, till the voice imperative sounded,"
26396,II,"And she obeyed the voice, and cast in her lot with her people"
26397,II,"Here in the desert land, and God would provide for the issue."
26398,II,
26399,II,"Meanwhile Joseph sat with folded hands, and demurely"
26400,II,"Listened, or seemed to listen, and in the silence that followed"
26401,II,Nothing was heard for a while but the step of Hannah the housemaid
26402,II,"Walking the floor overhead, and setting the chambers in order."
26403,II,"And Elizabeth said, with a smile of compassion, ""The maiden"
26404,II,"Hath a light heart in her breast, but her feet are heavy and awkward."""
26405,II,"Inwardly Joseph laughed, but governed his tongue, and was silent."
26406,II,
26407,II,"Then came the hour of sleep, death's counterfeit, nightly rehearsal"
26408,II,"Of the great Silent Assembly, the Meeting of shadows, where no man"
26409,II,"Speaketh, but all are still, and the peace and rest are unbroken!"
26410,II,Silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended.
26411,II,"But when the morning dawned, and the sun uprose in his splendor,"
26412,II,"Breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens,"
26413,II,Joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway
26414,II,"Through the drifts of snow; the horses already were harnessed,"
26415,II,"And John Estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold,"
26416,II,Saying that he should return at the Meeting in May; while above them
26417,II,"Hannah the housemaid, the homely, was looking out of the attic,"
26418,II,"Laughing aloud at Joseph, then suddenly closing the casement,"
26419,II,"As the bird in a cuckoo-clock peeps out of its window,"
26420,II,"Then disappears again, and closes the shutter behind it."

26426,III,"Now was the winter gone, and the snow; and Robin the Redbreast,"
26427,III,"Boasted on bush and tree it was he, it was he and no other"
26428,III,"That had covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood, and blithely"
26429,III,"All the birds sang with him, and little cared for his boasting,"
26430,III,"Or for his Babes in the Wood, or the Cruel Uncle, and only"
26431,III,"Sang for the mates they had chosen, and cared for the nests they were building."
26432,III,"With them, but more sedately and meekly, Elizabeth Haddon"
26433,III,"Sang in her inmost heart, but her lips were silent and songless."
26434,III,"Thus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music,"
26435,III,"Flooding the earth with flowers, and the air with melodies vernal."
26436,III,
26437,III,"Then it came to pass, one pleasant morning, that slowly"
26438,III,"Up the road there came a cavalcade, as of pilgrims"
26439,III,"Men and women, wending their way to the Quarterly Meeting"
26440,III,In the neighboring town; and with them came riding John Estaugh.
26441,III,"At Elizabeth's door they stopped to rest, and alighting"
26442,III,"Tasted the currant wine, and the bread of rye, and the honey"
26443,III,"Brought from the hives, that stood by the sunny wall of the garden;"
26444,III,"Then remounted their horses, refreshed, and continued their journey,"
26445,III,"And Elizabeth with them, and Joseph, and Hannah the housemaid."
26446,III,"But, as they started, Elizabeth lingered a little, and leaning"
26447,III,"Over her horse's neck, in a whisper said to John Estaugh"
26448,III,"""Tarry awhile behind, for I have something to tell thee,"
26449,III,"Not to be spoken lightly, nor in the presence of others;"
26450,III,"Them it concerneth not, only thee and me it concerneth."""
26451,III,"And they rode slowly along through the woods, conversing together."
26452,III,It was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest;
26453,III,It was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy May morning!
26454,III,
26455,III,"Then Elizabeth said, though still with a certain reluctance,"
26456,III,As if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded:
26457,III,"""I will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee;"
26458,III,"I have received from the Lord a charge to love thee, John Estaugh."""
26459,III,
26460,III,"And John Estaugh made answer, surprised by the words she had spoken,"
26461,III,"""Pleasant to me are thy converse, thy ways, thy meekness of spirit;"
26462,III,"Pleasant thy frankness of speech, and thy soul's immaculate whiteness,"
26463,III,"Love without dissimulation, a holy and inward adorning."
26464,III,"But I have yet no light to lead me, no voice to direct me."
26465,III,"When the Lord's work is done, and the toil and the labor completed"
26466,III,"He hath appointed to me, I will gather into the stillness"
26467,III,"Of my own heart awhile, and listen and wait for his guidance."""
26468,III,
26469,III,"Then Elizabeth said, not troubled nor wounded in spirit,"
26470,III,"""So is it best, John Estaugh.  We will not speak of it further."
26471,III,"It hath been laid upon me to tell thee this, for to-morrow"
26472,III,"Thou art going away, across the sea, and I know not"
26473,III,"When I shall see thee more; but if the Lord hath decreed it,"
26474,III,"Thou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me."""
26475,III,"And they rode onward in silence, and entered the town with the others."

26480,IV,

26482,IV,Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;
26483,IV,"So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,"
26484,IV,"Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence."
26485,IV,
26486,IV,Now went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead.
26487,IV,"Patient and unrepining Elizabeth labored, in all things"
26488,IV,"Mindful not of herself, but bearing the burdens of others,"
26489,IV,Always thoughtful and kind and untroubled; and Hannah the housemaid
26490,IV,"Diligent early and late, and rosy with washing and scouring,"
26491,IV,"Still as of old disparaged the eminent merits of Joseph,"
26492,IV,"And was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior,"
26493,IV,"For her shy looks, and her careless words, and her evil surmisings,"
26494,IV,"Being pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen,"
26495,IV,"As she would sometimes say to Joseph, quoting the Scriptures."
26496,IV,
26497,IV,"Meanwhile John Estaugh departed across the sea, and departing"
26498,IV,"Carried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious,"
26499,IV,"Filling its chambers with fragrance, and seeming to him in its sweetness"
26500,IV,"Mary's ointment of spikenard, that filled all the house with its odor."
26501,IV,"O lost days of delight, that are wasted in doubting and waiting!"
26502,IV,O lost hours and days in which we might have been happy!
26503,IV,"But the light shone at last, and guided his wavering footsteps,"
26504,IV,"And at last came the voice, imperative, questionless, certain."
26505,IV,
26506,IV,"Then John Estaugh came back o'er the sea for the gift that was offered,"
26507,IV,"Better than houses and lands, the gift of a woman's affection."
26508,IV,"And on the First-Day that followed, he rose in the Silent Assembly,"
26509,IV,"Holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little,"
26510,IV,Promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things.
26511,IV,Such were the marriage-rites of John and Elizabeth Estaugh.
26512,IV,
26513,IV,"And not otherwise Joseph, the honest, the diligent servant,"
26514,IV,Sped in his bashful wooing with homely Hannah the housemaid;
26515,IV,"For when he asked her the question, she answered, ""Nay""; and then added"
26516,IV,"""But thee may make believe, and see what will come of it, Joseph."""

26577,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Once on a time, some centuries ago,"
26578,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,In the hot sunshine two Franciscan friars
26579,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Wended their weary way with footsteps slow
26580,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Back to their convent, whose white walls and spires"
26581,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Gleamed on the hillside like a patch of snow;
26582,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Covered with dust they were, and torn by briers,"
26583,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And bore like sumpter-mules upon their backs
26584,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The badge of poverty, their beggar's sacks."
26585,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26586,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The first was Brother Anthony, a spare"
26587,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And silent man, with pallid cheeks and thin,"
26588,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Much given to vigils, penance, fasting, prayer,"
26589,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Solemn and gray, and worn with discipline,"
26590,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"As if his body but white ashes were,"
26591,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Heaped on the living coals that glowed within;
26592,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"A simple monk, like many of his day,"
26593,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Whose instinct was to listen and obey.
26594,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26595,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"A different man was Brother Timothy,"
26596,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Of larger mould and of a coarser paste;
26597,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"A rubicund and stalwart monk was he,"
26598,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Broad in the shoulders, broader in the waist,"
26599,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Who often filled the dull refectory
26600,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"With noise by which the convent was disgraced,"
26601,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"But to the mass-book gave but little heed,"
26602,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,By reason he had never learned to read.
26603,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26604,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Now, as they passed the outskirts of a wood,"
26605,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"They saw, with mingled pleasure and surprise,"
26606,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Fast tethered to a tree an ass, that stood"
26607,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Lazily winking his large, limpid eyes."
26608,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,The farmer Gilbert of that neighborhood
26609,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"His owner was, who, looking for supplies"
26610,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Of fagots, deeper in the wood had strayed,"
26611,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Leaving his beast to ponder in the shade.
26612,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26613,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,As soon as Brother Timothy espied
26614,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The patient animal, he said: ""Good-lack!"
26615,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Thus for our needs doth Providence provide;
26616,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"We'll lay our wallets on the creature's back."""
26617,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"This being done, he leisurely untied"
26618,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"From head and neck the halter of the jack,"
26619,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And put it round his own, and to the tree"
26620,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Stood tethered fast as if the ass were he.
26621,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26622,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And, bursting forth into a merry laugh,"
26623,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"He cried to Brother Anthony: ""Away!"
26624,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And drive the ass before you with your staff;
26625,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And when you reach the convent you may say
26626,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"You left me at a farm, half tired and half"
26627,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Ill with a fever, for a night and day,"
26628,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And that the farmer lent this ass to bear
26629,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Our wallets, that are heavy with good fare."""
26630,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26631,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Now Brother Anthony, who knew the pranks"
26632,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Of Brother Timothy, would not persuade"
26633,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Or reason with him on his quirks and cranks,"
26634,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"But, being obedient, silently obeyed;"
26635,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And, smiting with his staff the ass's flanks,"
26636,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Drove him before him over hill and glade,"
26637,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Safe with his provend to the convent gate,"
26638,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Leaving poor Brother Timothy to his fate.
26639,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26640,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Then Gilbert, laden with fagots for his fire,"
26641,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Forth issued from the wood, and stood aghast"
26642,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,To see the ponderous body of the friar
26643,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Standing where he had left his donkey last.
26644,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Trembling he stood, and dared not venture nigher,"
26645,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"But stared, and gaped, and crossed himself full fast;"
26646,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"For, being credulous and of little wit,"
26647,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,He thought it was some demon from the pit.
26648,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26649,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"While speechless and bewildered thus he gazed,"
26650,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And dropped his load of fagots on the ground,"
26651,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Quoth Brother Timothy: ""Be not amazed"
26652,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,That where you left a donkey should be found
26653,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"A poor Franciscan friar, half-starved and crazed,"
26654,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Standing demure and with a halter bound;
26655,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"But set me free, and hear the piteous story"
26656,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Of Brother Timothy of Casal-Maggiore.
26657,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26658,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""I am a sinful man, although you see"

26661,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Changed and transformed from my own natural shape
26662,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"All for the deadly sin of gluttony,"
26663,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"From which I could not otherwise escape,"
26664,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Than by this penance, dieting on grass,"
26665,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And being worked and beaten as an ass.

26670,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"My wretched lodging in a windy shed,"
26671,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"My scanty fare so grudgingly procured,"
26672,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,The damp and musty straw that formed my bed!

26676,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The simple Gilbert, hearing words like these,"
26677,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Was conscience-stricken, and fell down apace"
26678,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Before the friar upon his bended knees,"
26679,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And with a suppliant voice implored his grace;
26680,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And the good monk, now very much at ease,"
26681,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Granted him pardon with a smiling face,"
26682,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Nor could refuse to be that night his guest,"
26683,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"It being late, and he in need of rest."
26684,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26685,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Upon a hillside, where the olive thrives,"
26686,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"With figures painted on its white-washed walls,"
26687,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,The cottage stood; and near the humming hives
26688,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Made murmurs as of far-off waterfalls;
26689,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,A place where those who love secluded lives
26690,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Might live content, and, free from noise and brawls,"
26691,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Like Claudian's Old Man of Verona here
26692,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Measure by fruits the slow-revolving year.
26693,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26694,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And, coming to this cottage of content"
26695,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"They found his children, and the buxom wench"
26696,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"His wife, Dame Cicely, and his father, bent"
26697,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"With years and labor, seated on a bench,"
26698,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Repeating over some obscure event
26699,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,In the old wars of Milanese and French;
26700,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"All welcomed the Franciscan, with a sense"
26701,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Of sacred awe and humble reverence.
26702,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26703,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"When Gilbert told them what had come to pass,"
26704,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"How beyond question, cavil, or surmise,"
26705,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Good Brother Timothy had been their ass,"
26706,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,You should have seen the wonder in their eyes;
26707,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"You should have heard them cry, ""Alas! alas!"
26708,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Have heard their lamentations and their sighs!
26709,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"For all believed the story, and began"
26710,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,To see a saint in this afflicted man.
26711,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26712,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Forthwith there was prepared a grand repast,"
26713,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,To satisfy the craving of the friar
26714,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,After so rigid and prolonged a fast;
26715,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,The bustling housewife stirred the kitchen fire;
26716,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Then her two barnyard fowls, her best and last,"
26717,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Were put to death, at her express desire,"
26718,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And served up with a salad in a bowl,"
26719,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And flasks of country wine to crown the whole.
26720,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26721,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,It would not be believed should I repeat

26729,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26730,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And all the while he talked without surcease,"
26731,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And told his merry tales with jovial glee
26732,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"That never flagged, but rather did increase,"
26733,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And laughed aloud as if insane were he,"
26734,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And wagged his red beard, matted like a fleece,"
26735,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And cast such glances at Dame Cicely
26736,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"That Gilbert now grew angry with his guest,"
26737,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And thus in words his rising wrath expressed.

26745,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And shows the dreadful peril you are in
26746,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Of a relapse into your deadly sin.
26747,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26748,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""To-morrow morning, with the rising sun,"
26749,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Go back unto your convent, nor refrain"
26750,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"From fasting and from scourging, for you run"
26751,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Great danger to become an ass again,"
26752,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Since monkish flesh and asinine are one;
26753,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Therefore be wise, nor longer here remain,"
26754,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Unless you wish the scourge should be applied
26755,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"By other hands, that will not spare your hide."""
26756,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26757,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"When this the monk had heard, his color fled"
26758,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And then returned, like lightning in the air,"
26759,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Till he was all one blush from foot to head,"
26760,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And even the bald spot in his russet hair
26761,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Turned from its usual pallor to bright red!
26762,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,The old man was asleep upon his chair.
26763,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Then all retired, and sank into the deep"
26764,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And helpless imbecility of sleep.
26765,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26766,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"They slept until the dawn of day drew near,"
26767,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Till the cock should have crowed, but did not crow,"
26768,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,For they had slain the shining chanticleer
26769,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And eaten him for supper, as you know."
26770,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The monk was up betimes and of good cheer,"
26771,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And, having breakfasted, made haste to go,"
26772,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"As if he heard the distant matin bell,"
26773,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And had but little time to say farewell.
26774,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26775,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Fresh was the morning as the breath of kine;
26776,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Odors of herbs commingled with the sweet
26777,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Balsamic exhalations of the pine;
26778,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,A haze was in the air presaging heat;
26779,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Uprose the sun above the Apennine,"
26780,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And all the misty valleys at its feet
26781,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Were full of the delirious song of birds,"
26782,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Voices of men, and bells, and low of herds."
26783,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26784,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,All this to Brother Timothy was naught;
26785,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"He did not care for scenery, nor here"
26786,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,His busy fancy found the thing it sought;
26787,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"But when he saw the convent walls appear,"
26788,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And smoke from kitchen chimneys upward caught
26789,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And whirled aloft into the atmosphere,"
26790,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"He quickened his slow footsteps, like a beast"
26791,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,That scents the stable a league off at least.
26792,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26793,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And as he entered though the convent gate
26794,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"He saw there in the court the ass, who stood"
26795,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Twirling his ears about, and seemed to wait,"
26796,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Just as he found him waiting in the wood;
26797,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And told the Prior that, to alleviate"
26798,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The daily labors of the brotherhood,"
26799,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The owner, being a man of means and thrift,"
26800,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Bestowed him on the convent as a gift.
26801,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26802,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And thereupon the Prior for many days
26803,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Revolved this serious matter in his mind,"
26804,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And turned it over many different ways,"
26805,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Hoping that some safe issue he might find;
26806,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"But stood in fear of what the world would say,"
26807,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"If he accepted presents of this kind,"
26808,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Employing beasts of burden for the packs,"
26809,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,That lazy monks should carry on their backs.
26810,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26811,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Then, to avoid all scandal of the sort,"
26812,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And stop the mouth of cavil, he decreed"
26813,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"That he would cut the tedious matter short,"
26814,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And sell the ass with all convenient speed,"
26815,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Thus saving the expense of his support,"
26816,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And hoarding something for a time of need.
26817,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"So he despatched him to the neighboring Fair,"
26818,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And freed himself from cumber and from care.
26819,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26820,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"It happened now by chance, as some might say,"
26821,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Others perhaps would call it destiny,"
26822,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Gilbert was at the Fair; and heard a bray,"
26823,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And nearer came, and saw that it was he,"
26824,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And whispered in his ear, ""Ah, lackaday!"
26825,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Good father, the rebellious flesh, I see,"
26826,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Has changed you back into an ass again,"
26827,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And all my admonitions were in vain."""
26828,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26829,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The ass, who felt this breathing in his ear,"
26830,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Did not turn round to look, but shook his head,"
26831,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"As if he were not pleased these words to hear,"
26832,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And contradicted all that had been said.
26833,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And this made Gilbert cry in voice more clear,"
26834,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""I know you well; your hair is russet-red;"
26835,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Do not deny it; for you are the same
26836,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Franciscan friar, and Timothy by name."""
26837,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26838,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The ass, though now the secret had come out,"
26839,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Was obstinate, and shook his head again;"
26840,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Until a crowd was gathered round about
26841,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,To hear this dialogue between the twain;
26842,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And raised their voices in a noisy shout
26843,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"When Gilbert tried to make the matter plain,"
26844,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And flouted him and mocked him all day long
26845,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,With laughter and with jibes and scraps of song.
26846,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26847,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""If this be Brother Timothy,"" they cried,"
26848,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""Buy him, and feed him on the tenderest grass;"
26849,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Thou canst not do too much for one so tried
26850,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"As to be twice transformed into an ass."""
26851,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"So simple Gilbert bought him, and untied"
26852,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"His halter, and o'er mountain and morass"
26853,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"He led him homeward, talking as he went"
26854,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Of good behavior and a mind content.
26855,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26856,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"The children saw them coming, and advanced,"
26857,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Shouting with joy, and hung about his neck,--"
26858,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Not Gilbert's, but the ass's,--round him danced,"
26859,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And wove green garlands where-withal to deck
26860,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,His sacred person; for again it chanced
26861,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Their childish feelings, without rein or check,"
26862,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Could not discriminate in any way
26863,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,A donkey from a friar of Orders Gray.
26864,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26865,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""O Brother Timothy,"" the children said,"
26866,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""You have come back to us just as before;"
26867,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"We were afraid, and thought that you were dead,"
26868,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And we should never see you any more."""
26869,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And then they kissed the white star on his head,"
26870,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"That like a birth-mark or a badge he wore,"
26871,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And patted him upon the neck and face,"
26872,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And said a thousand things with childish grace.
26873,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26874,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Thenceforward and forever he was known
26875,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"As Brother Timothy, and led alway"
26876,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"A life of luxury, till he had grown"
26877,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Ungrateful being stuffed with corn and hay,"
26878,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And very vicious.  Then in angry tone,"
26879,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Rousing himself, poor Gilbert said one day"
26880,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"""When simple kindness is misunderstood"
26881,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"A little flagellation may do good."""
26882,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26883,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,His many vices need not here be told;
26884,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Among them was a habit that he had
26885,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Of flinging up his heels at young and old,"
26886,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Breaking his halter, running off like mad"
26887,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"O'er pasture-lands and meadow, wood and wold,"
26888,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And other misdemeanors quite as bad;
26889,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,But worst of all was breaking from his shed
26890,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"At night, and ravaging the cabbage-bed."
26891,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26892,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,So Brother Timothy went back once more
26893,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,To his old life of labor and distress;
26894,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Was beaten worse than he had been before.
26895,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And now, instead of comfort and caress,"
26896,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Came labors manifold and trials sore;
26897,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And as his toils increased his food grew less,"
26898,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Until at last the great consoler, Death,"
26899,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Ended his many sufferings with his breath.
26900,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,
26901,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,Great was the lamentation when he died;
26902,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,And mainly that he died impenitent;
26903,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"Dame Cicely bewailed, the children cried,"
26904,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,The old man still remembered the event
26905,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"In the French war, and Gilbert magnified"
26906,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"His many virtues, as he came and went,"
26907,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And said: ""Heaven pardon Brother Timothy,"
26908,THE MONK OF CASAL-MAGGIORE,"And keep us from the sin of gluttony."""

26916,INTERLUDE,"""The were-wolf is a legend old,"
26917,INTERLUDE,"But the were-ass is something new,"
26918,INTERLUDE,And yet for one I think it true.
26919,INTERLUDE,The days of wonder have not ceased
26920,INTERLUDE,"If there are beasts in forms of men,"
26921,INTERLUDE,"As sure it happens now and then,"

26924,INTERLUDE,
26925,INTERLUDE,"""But this I will not now discuss,"
26926,INTERLUDE,"I leave the theme, that we may thus"
26927,INTERLUDE,Remain within the realm of song.
26928,INTERLUDE,"The story that I told before,"
26929,INTERLUDE,"Though not acceptable to all,"
26930,INTERLUDE,At least you did not find too long.
26931,INTERLUDE,"I beg you, let me try again,"
26932,INTERLUDE,"With something in a different vein,"
26933,INTERLUDE,Before you bid the curtain fall.
26934,INTERLUDE,"Meanwhile keep watch upon the door,"
26935,INTERLUDE,"Nor let the Landlord leave his chair,"
26936,INTERLUDE,"Lest he should vanish into air,"
26937,INTERLUDE,"And thus elude our search once more."""
26938,INTERLUDE,
26939,INTERLUDE,"Thus saying, from his lips he blew"
26940,INTERLUDE,"A little cloud of perfumed breath,"
26941,INTERLUDE,"And then, as if it were a clew"
26942,INTERLUDE,"To lead his footsteps safely through,"

26951,SCANDERBEG,The battle is fought and won
26952,SCANDERBEG,"By King Ladislaus the Hun,"
26953,SCANDERBEG,"In fire of hell and death's frost,"
26954,SCANDERBEG,On the day of Pentecost.
26955,SCANDERBEG,And in rout before his path
26956,SCANDERBEG,From the field of battle red
26957,SCANDERBEG,Flee all that are not dead
26958,SCANDERBEG,Of the army of Amurath.
26959,SCANDERBEG,
26960,SCANDERBEG,In the darkness of the night
26961,SCANDERBEG,"Iskander, the pride and boast"
26962,SCANDERBEG,"Of that mighty Othman host,"
26963,SCANDERBEG,"With his routed Turks, takes flight"
26964,SCANDERBEG,From the battle fought and lost
26965,SCANDERBEG,On the day of Pentecost;
26966,SCANDERBEG,Leaving behind him dead
26967,SCANDERBEG,"The army of Amurath,"
26968,SCANDERBEG,"The vanguard as it led,"
26969,SCANDERBEG,"The rearguard as it fled,"
26970,SCANDERBEG,Mown down in the bloody swath
26971,SCANDERBEG,Of the battle's aftermath.
26972,SCANDERBEG,
26973,SCANDERBEG,"But he cared not for Hospodars,"
26974,SCANDERBEG,"Nor for Baron or Voivode,"
26975,SCANDERBEG,As on through the night he rode
26976,SCANDERBEG,"And gazed at the fateful stars,"
26977,SCANDERBEG,That were shining overhead
26978,SCANDERBEG,"But smote his steed with his staff,"
26979,SCANDERBEG,"And smiled to himself, and said;"
26980,SCANDERBEG,"""This is the time to laugh."""
26981,SCANDERBEG,
26982,SCANDERBEG,"In the middle of the night,"
26983,SCANDERBEG,"In a halt of the hurrying flight,"
26984,SCANDERBEG,There came a Scribe of the King
26985,SCANDERBEG,"Wearing his signet ring,"
26986,SCANDERBEG,And said in a voice severe:
26987,SCANDERBEG,"""This is the first dark blot"
26988,SCANDERBEG,"On thy name, George Castriot!"
26989,SCANDERBEG,"Alas why art thou here,"

26991,SCANDERBEG,"And left on the battle plain?"""
26992,SCANDERBEG,
26993,SCANDERBEG,And Iskander answered and said:
26994,SCANDERBEG,"""They lie on the bloody sod"
26995,SCANDERBEG,By the hoofs of horses trod;
26996,SCANDERBEG,But this was the decree
26997,SCANDERBEG,Of the watchers overhead;
26998,SCANDERBEG,"For the war belongeth to God,"
26999,SCANDERBEG,"And in battle who are we,"
27000,SCANDERBEG,"Who are we, that shall withstand"
27001,SCANDERBEG,"The wind of his lifted hand?"""
27002,SCANDERBEG,
27003,SCANDERBEG,Then he bade them bind with chains
27004,SCANDERBEG,This man of books and brains;
27005,SCANDERBEG,"And the Scribe said: ""What misdeed"
27006,SCANDERBEG,"Have I done, that, without need,"
27007,SCANDERBEG,"Thou doest to me this thing?"""
27008,SCANDERBEG,And Iskander answering
27009,SCANDERBEG,"Said unto him: ""Not one"
27010,SCANDERBEG,Misdeed to me hast thou done;
27011,SCANDERBEG,But for fear that thou shouldst run
27012,SCANDERBEG,"And hide thyself from me,"
27013,SCANDERBEG,Have I done this unto thee.
27014,SCANDERBEG,
27015,SCANDERBEG,"""Now write me a writing, O Scribe,"
27016,SCANDERBEG,And a blessing be on thy tribe!

27022,SCANDERBEG,"In the name of my master, the King;"
27023,SCANDERBEG,For what is writ in his name
27024,SCANDERBEG,"Can never be recalled."""
27025,SCANDERBEG,
27026,SCANDERBEG,"And the Scribe bowed low in dread,"
27027,SCANDERBEG,And unto Iskander said:
27028,SCANDERBEG,"""Allah is great and just,"
27029,SCANDERBEG,But we are as ashes and dust;
27030,SCANDERBEG,"How shall I do this thing,"
27031,SCANDERBEG,When I know that my guilty head
27032,SCANDERBEG,"Will be forfeit to the King?"""
27033,SCANDERBEG,
27034,SCANDERBEG,Then swift as a shooting star
27035,SCANDERBEG,The curved and shining blade
27036,SCANDERBEG,Of Iskander's scimetar
27037,SCANDERBEG,"From its sheath, with jewels bright,"
27038,SCANDERBEG,"Shot, as he thundered: ""Write!"""
27039,SCANDERBEG,"And the trembling Scribe obeyed,"
27040,SCANDERBEG,And wrote in the fitful glare
27041,SCANDERBEG,"Of the bivouac fire apart,"
27042,SCANDERBEG,With the chill of the midnight air
27043,SCANDERBEG,"On his forehead white and bare,"
27044,SCANDERBEG,And the chill of death in his heart.
27045,SCANDERBEG,
27046,SCANDERBEG,Then again Iskander cried:
27047,SCANDERBEG,"""Now follow whither I ride,"
27048,SCANDERBEG,For here thou must not stay.
27049,SCANDERBEG,"Thou shalt be as my dearest friend,"
27050,SCANDERBEG,And honors without end
27051,SCANDERBEG,"Shall surround thee on every side,"
27052,SCANDERBEG,"And attend thee night and day."""
27053,SCANDERBEG,But the sullen Scribe replied
27054,SCANDERBEG,"""Our pathways here divide;"
27055,SCANDERBEG,"Mine leadeth not thy way."""
27056,SCANDERBEG,
27057,SCANDERBEG,And even as he spoke
27058,SCANDERBEG,"Fell a sudden scimetar-stroke,"
27059,SCANDERBEG,When no one else was near;
27060,SCANDERBEG,"And the Scribe sank to the ground,"
27061,SCANDERBEG,"As a stone, pushed from the brink"
27062,SCANDERBEG,"Of a black pool, might sink"
27063,SCANDERBEG,With a sob and disappear;
27064,SCANDERBEG,And no one saw the deed;
27065,SCANDERBEG,And in the stillness around
27066,SCANDERBEG,No sound was heard but the sound
27067,SCANDERBEG,"Of the hoofs of Iskander's steed,"
27068,SCANDERBEG,As forward he sprang with a bound.
27069,SCANDERBEG,
27070,SCANDERBEG,"Then onward he rode and afar,"
27071,SCANDERBEG,"With scarce three hundred men,"
27072,SCANDERBEG,"Through river and forest and fen,"
27073,SCANDERBEG,O'er the mountains of Argentar;
27074,SCANDERBEG,"And his heart was merry within,"

27076,SCANDERBEG,And saw in the gleam of the morn
27077,SCANDERBEG,"The White Castle Ak-Hissar,"
27078,SCANDERBEG,"The city Croia called,"
27079,SCANDERBEG,"The city moated and walled,"
27080,SCANDERBEG,"The city where he was born,--"
27081,SCANDERBEG,And above it the morning star.
27082,SCANDERBEG,
27083,SCANDERBEG,Then his trumpeters in the van
27084,SCANDERBEG,"On their silver bugles blew,"
27085,SCANDERBEG,And in crowds about him ran
27086,SCANDERBEG,"Albanian and Turkoman,"
27087,SCANDERBEG,That the sound together drew.
27088,SCANDERBEG,"And he feasted with his friends,"
27089,SCANDERBEG,"And when they were warm with wine,"
27090,SCANDERBEG,"He said: ""O friends of mine,"

27097,SCANDERBEG,
27098,SCANDERBEG,Then to the Castle White
27099,SCANDERBEG,"He rode in regal state,"
27100,SCANDERBEG,And entered in at the gate
27101,SCANDERBEG,"In all his arms bedight,"
27102,SCANDERBEG,And gave to the Pasha
27103,SCANDERBEG,Who ruled in Croia
27104,SCANDERBEG,"The writing of the King,"
27105,SCANDERBEG,Sealed with his signet ring.
27106,SCANDERBEG,"And the Pasha bowed his head,"
27107,SCANDERBEG,And after a silence said:
27108,SCANDERBEG,"""Allah is just and great!"
27109,SCANDERBEG,"I yield to the will divine,"
27110,SCANDERBEG,The city and lands are thine;

27112,SCANDERBEG,
27113,SCANDERBEG,Anon from the castle walls
27114,SCANDERBEG,"The crescent banner falls,"

27116,SCANDERBEG,"Like a portent in the sky,"
27117,SCANDERBEG,"Iskander's banner fly,"
27118,SCANDERBEG,The Black Eagle with double head;
27119,SCANDERBEG,"And a shout ascends on high,"
27120,SCANDERBEG,"For men's souls are tired of the Turks,"
27121,SCANDERBEG,"And their wicked ways and works,"
27122,SCANDERBEG,That have made of Ak-Hissar
27123,SCANDERBEG,A city of the plague;
27124,SCANDERBEG,"And the loud, exultant cry"
27125,SCANDERBEG,That echoes wide and far
27126,SCANDERBEG,"Is: ""Long live Scanderbeg!"""
27127,SCANDERBEG,
27128,SCANDERBEG,It was thus Iskander came
27129,SCANDERBEG,Once more unto his own;
27130,SCANDERBEG,"And the tidings, like the flame"
27131,SCANDERBEG,Of a conflagration blown
27132,SCANDERBEG,"By the winds of summer, ran,"
27133,SCANDERBEG,"Till the land was in a blaze,"
27134,SCANDERBEG,"And the cities far and near,"
27135,SCANDERBEG,"Sayeth Ben Joshua Ben Meir,"
27136,SCANDERBEG,"In his Book of the Words of the Days,"

27147,INTERLUDE,"Gauntlet on hand and boot on leg,"
27148,INTERLUDE,"And skilled in every warlike art,"

27152,INTERLUDE,
27153,INTERLUDE,The Theologian added here
27154,INTERLUDE,"His word of praise not less sincere,"

27156,INTERLUDE,"""The hero of romance and song"
27157,INTERLUDE,"Was born,"" he said, ""to right the wrong;"
27158,INTERLUDE,And I approve; but all the same

27160,INTERLUDE,"Adds nothing to your hero's fame."""
27161,INTERLUDE,
27162,INTERLUDE,The Student praised the good old times
27163,INTERLUDE,"And liked the canter of the rhymes,"
27164,INTERLUDE,That had a hoofbeat in their sound;
27165,INTERLUDE,But longed some further word to hear
27166,INTERLUDE,"Of the old chronicler Ben Meir,"
27167,INTERLUDE,And where his volume might he found.
27168,INTERLUDE,The tall Musician walked the room
27169,INTERLUDE,"With folded arms and gleaming eyes,"
27170,INTERLUDE,"As if he saw the Vikings rise,"
27171,INTERLUDE,Gigantic shadows in the gloom;
27172,INTERLUDE,"And much he talked of their emprise,"
27173,INTERLUDE,"And meteors seen in Northern skies,"
27174,INTERLUDE,"And Heimdal's horn, and day of doom"
27175,INTERLUDE,But the Sicilian laughed again;
27176,INTERLUDE,"""This is the time to laugh,"" he said,"
27177,INTERLUDE,For the whole story he well knew
27178,INTERLUDE,"Was an invention of the Jew,"
27179,INTERLUDE,"Spun from the cobwebs in his brain,"
27180,INTERLUDE,And of the same bright scarlet thread
27181,INTERLUDE,As was the Tale of Kambalu.
27182,INTERLUDE,
27183,INTERLUDE,Only the Landlord spake no word;
27184,INTERLUDE,'T was doubtful whether he had heard
27185,INTERLUDE,"The tale at all, so full of care"
27186,INTERLUDE,"Was he of his impending fate,"
27187,INTERLUDE,"That, like the sword of Damocles,"
27188,INTERLUDE,"Above his head hung blank and bare,"
27189,INTERLUDE,"Suspended by a single hair,"
27190,INTERLUDE,"So that he could not sit at ease,"
27191,INTERLUDE,"But sighed and looked disconsolate,"
27192,INTERLUDE,"And shifted restless in his chair,"
27193,INTERLUDE,Revolving how he might evade
27194,INTERLUDE,The blow of the descending blade.
27195,INTERLUDE,
27196,INTERLUDE,The Student came to his relief
27197,INTERLUDE,By saying in his easy way
27198,INTERLUDE,"To the Musician: ""Calm your grief,"
27199,INTERLUDE,"My fair Apollo of the North,"

27205,INTERLUDE,Or something of the kind to suit
27206,INTERLUDE,The mood that we are in to-night
27207,INTERLUDE,For what is marvellous and strange;
27208,INTERLUDE,"So give your nimble fancy range,"
27209,INTERLUDE,"And we will follow in its flight."""
27210,INTERLUDE,
27211,INTERLUDE,But the Musician shook his head;
27212,INTERLUDE,"""No tale I tell to-night,"" he said,"
27213,INTERLUDE,"""While my poor instrument lies there,"

27215,INTERLUDE,"Lies in its little coffin dead."""
27216,INTERLUDE,
27217,INTERLUDE,"Yet, being urged, he said at last:"
27218,INTERLUDE,"""There comes to me out of the Past"
27219,INTERLUDE,"A voice, whose tones are sweet and wild,"
27220,INTERLUDE,"Singing a song almost divine,"
27221,INTERLUDE,And with a tear in every line;
27222,INTERLUDE,"An ancient ballad, that my nurse"
27223,INTERLUDE,"Sang to me when I was a child,"
27224,INTERLUDE,In accents tender as the verse;
27225,INTERLUDE,"And sometimes wept, and sometimes smiled"
27226,INTERLUDE,"While singing it, to see arise"
27227,INTERLUDE,"The look of wonder in my eyes,"
27228,INTERLUDE,And feel my heart with tenor beat.

27458,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,This country-seat was little more
27459,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Than a cabin of log's; but in front of the door
27460,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,A modest flower-bed thickly sown
27461,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,With sweet alyssum and columbine
27462,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Made those who saw it at once divine
27463,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,The touch of some other hand than his own.
27464,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And first it was whispered, and then it was known,"
27465,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,That he in secret was harboring there
27466,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"A little lady with golden hair,"
27467,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Whom he called his cousin, but whom he had wed"
27468,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"In the Italian manner, as men said,"
27469,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And great was the scandal everywhere.
27470,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27471,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"But worse than this was the vague surmise,"
27472,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Though none could vouch for it or aver,"
27473,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,That the Knight of the Holy Sepulchre
27474,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Was only a Papist in disguise;
27475,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And the more to imbitter their bitter lives,"
27476,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And the more to trouble the public mind,"
27477,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Came letters from England, from two other wives,"
27478,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Whom he had carelessly left behind;
27479,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Both of them letters of such a kind
27480,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,As made the governor hold his breath;
27481,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,The one imploring him straight to send
27482,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"The husband home, that he might amend;"
27483,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"The other asking his instant death,"
27484,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,As the only way to make an end.
27485,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27486,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"The wary governor deemed it right,"
27487,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"When all this wickedness was revealed,"
27488,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"To send his warrant signed and sealed,"
27489,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And take the body of the knight.
27490,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Armed with this mighty instrument,"
27491,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"The marshal, mounting his gallant steed,"
27492,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Rode forth from town at the top of his speed,"
27493,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And followed by all his bailiffs bold,"
27494,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"As if on high achievement bent,"
27495,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"To storm some castle or stronghold,"
27496,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Challenge the warders on the wall,"
27497,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And seize in his ancestral hall
27498,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,A robber-baron grim and old.
27499,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27500,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,But when though all the dust and heat
27501,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"He came to Sir Christopher's country-seat,"
27502,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"No knight he found, nor warder there,"
27503,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"But the little lady with golden hair,"
27504,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Who was gathering in the bright sunshine
27505,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,The sweet alyssum and columbine;
27506,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"While gallant Sir Christopher, all so gay,"
27507,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Being forewarned, through the postern gate"
27508,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Of his castle wall had tripped away,"
27509,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And was keeping a little holiday
27510,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"In the forests, that bounded his estate."
27511,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27512,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Then as a trusty squire and true
27513,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"The marshal searched the castle through,"
27514,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Not crediting what the lady said;
27515,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Searched from cellar to garret in vain,"
27516,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And, finding no knight, came out again"
27517,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And arrested the golden damsel instead,"
27518,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And bore her in triumph into the town,"
27519,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,While from her eyes the tears rolled down
27520,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"On the sweet alyssum and columbine,"
27521,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,That she held in her fingers white and fine.
27522,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27523,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,The governor's heart was moved to see
27524,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,So fair a creature caught within
27525,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"The snares of Satan and of sin,"
27526,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And he read her a little homily
27527,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,On the folly and wickedness of the lives
27528,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Of women, half cousins and half wives;"
27529,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"But, seeing that naught his words availed,"
27530,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,He sent her away in a ship that sailed
27531,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"For Merry England over the sea,"
27532,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"To the other two wives in the old countree,"
27533,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"To search her further, since he had failed"
27534,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,To come at the heart of the mystery.
27535,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27536,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Meanwhile Sir Christopher wandered away
27537,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Through pathless woods for a month and a day,"
27538,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Shooting pigeons, and sleeping at night"
27539,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"With the noble savage, who took delight"
27540,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"In his feathered hat and his velvet vest,"
27541,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,His gun and his rapier and the rest.
27542,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,But as soon as the noble savage heard
27543,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"That a bounty was offered for this gay bird,"
27544,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"He wanted to slay him out of hand,"
27545,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"And bring in his beautiful scalp for a show,"
27546,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Like the glossy head of a kite or crow,"
27547,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Until he was made to understand
27548,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"They wanted the bird alive, not dead;"
27549,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Then he followed him whithersoever he fled,"
27550,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Through forest and field, and hunted him down,"
27551,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And brought him prisoner into the town.
27552,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27553,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Alas! it was a rueful sight,"
27554,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,To see this melancholy knight
27555,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,In such a dismal and hapless case;
27556,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"His hat deformed by stain and dent,"
27557,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"His plumage broken, his doublet rent,"
27558,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"His beard and flowing locks forlorn,"
27559,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Matted, dishevelled, and unshorn,"
27560,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,His boots with dust and mire besprent;
27561,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"But dignified in his disgrace,"
27562,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And wearing an unblushing face.
27563,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And thus before the magistrate
27564,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,He stood to hear the doom of fate.
27565,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,In vain he strove with wonted ease
27566,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,To modify and extenuate
27567,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"His evil deeds in church and state,"
27568,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,For gone was now his power to please;
27569,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And his pompous words had no more weight
27570,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,Than feathers flying in the breeze.
27571,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27572,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,With suavity equal to his own
27573,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,The governor lent a patient ear
27574,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"To the speech evasive and highflown,"
27575,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,In which he endeavored to make clear
27576,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,That colonial laws were too severe
27577,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"When applied to a gallant cavalier,"
27578,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"A gentleman born, and so well known,"
27579,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And accustomed to move in a higher sphere.
27580,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27581,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"All this the Puritan governor heard,"
27582,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,And deigned in answer never a word;
27583,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"But in summary manner shipped away,"
27584,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"In a vessel that sailed from Salem bay,"
27585,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"This splendid and famous cavalier,"
27586,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"With his Rupert hat and his popery,"
27587,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"To Merry England over the sea,"
27588,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,As being unmeet to inhabit here.
27589,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,
27590,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Thus endeth the Rhyme of Sir Christopher,"
27591,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,"Knight of the Holy Sepulchre,"
27592,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,The first who furnished this barren land
27593,THE RHYME OF SIR CHRISTOPHER,With apples of Sodom and ropes of sand.

27617,FINALE,"Into a momentary glow,"
27618,FINALE,"Lingering like them when forced to go,"

27638,FINALE,"Uprose the sun; and every guest,"

29829,V,"Frequented by the lyric Muse,"
29830,V,"The phantom with the beckoning hand,"
29831,V,That still allures and still eludes.
29832,V,O sweet illusions of the brain!
29833,V,O sudden thrills of fire and frost!

29842,VI,And so the stream of Time that lingereth
29843,VI,"In level places, and so dull appears,"
29844,VI,Runs with a swifter current as it nears
29845,VI,The gloomy mills of Death.
29846,VI,
29847,VI,"And now, like the magician's scroll,"
29848,VI,That in the owner's keeping shrinks
29849,VI,"With every wish he speaks or thinks,"
29850,VI,"Till the last wish consumes the whole,"
29851,VI,"The table dwindles, and again"
29852,VI,I see the two alone remain.
29853,VI,The crown of stars is broken in parts;
29854,VI,"Its jewels, brighter than the day,"
29855,VI,Have one by one been stolen away
29856,VI,To shine in other homes and hearts.
29857,VI,One is a wanderer now afar
29858,VI,"In Ceylon or in Zanzibar,"
29859,VI,Or sunny regions of Cathay;
29860,VI,And one is in the boisterous camp
29861,VI,"Mid clink of arms and horses' tramp,"
29862,VI,And battle's terrible array.
29863,VI,"I see the patient mother read,"
29864,VI,"With aching heart, of wrecks that float"
29865,VI,"Disabled on those seas remote,"
29866,VI,Or of some great heroic deed
29867,VI,On battle-fields where thousands bleed
29868,VI,To lift one hero into fame.
29869,VI,Anxious she bends her graceful head
29870,VI,"Above these chronicles of pain,"
29871,VI,And trembles with a secret dread
29872,VI,Lest there among the drowned or slain
29873,VI,She find the one beloved name.

29879,VII,"Sometimes the setting sun breaks out again,"
29880,VII,"And touching all the darksome woods with light,"
29881,VII,"Smiles on the fields, until they laugh and sing,"
29882,VII,Then like a ruby from the horizon's ring
29883,VII,Drops down into the night.
29884,VII,
29885,VII,"What see I now?  The night is fair,"
29886,VII,"The storm of grief, the clouds of care,"
29887,VII,"The wind, the rain, have passed away;"
29888,VII,"The lamps are lit, the fires burn bright,"
29889,VII,The house is full of life and light:
29890,VII,It is the Golden Wedding day.
29891,VII,"The guests come thronging in once more,"
29892,VII,"Quick footsteps sound along the floor,"
29893,VII,"The trooping children crowd the stair,"
29894,VII,And in and out and everywhere
29895,VII,Flashes along the corridor
29896,VII,The sunshine of their golden hair.
29897,VII,On the round table in the hall
29898,VII,Another Ariadne's Crown
29899,VII,Out of the sky hath fallen down;
29900,VII,More than one Monarch of the Moon
29901,VII,Is drumming with his silver spoon;
29902,VII,The light of love shines over all.
29903,VII,
29904,VII,"O fortunate, O happy day!"
29905,VII,"The people sing, the people say."
29906,VII,"The ancient bridegroom and the bride,"
29907,VII,Smiling contented and serene
29908,VII,"Upon the blithe, bewildering scene,"
29909,VII,"Behold, well pleased, on every side"
29910,VII,"Their forms and features multiplied,"
29911,VII,As the reflection of a light
29912,VII,"Between two burnished mirrors gleams,"
29913,VII,Or lamps upon a bridge at night
29914,VII,"Stretch on and on before the sight,"
29915,VII,Till the long vista endless seems.

29982,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Whose simple lives, complete and without flaw,"

30017,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Of Trojans and Achaians in the field;
30018,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,So from the snowy summits of our years
30019,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"We see you in the plain, as each appears,"
30020,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And question of you; asking, ""Who is he"

30028,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Wherein kind Nature meant you to excel.
30029,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Not every blossom ripens into fruit;
30030,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Minerva, the inventress of the flute,"
30031,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Flung it aside, when she her face surveyed"
30032,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Distorted in a fountain as she played;
30033,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The unlucky Marsyas found it, and his fate"
30034,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Was one to make the bravest hesitate.
30035,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30036,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Write on your doors the saying wise and old,"

30039,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Than the defect; better the more than less;
30040,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Better like Hector in the field to die,"
30041,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Than like a perfumed Paris turn and fly,"
30042,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30043,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And now, my classmates; ye remaining few"
30044,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"That number not the half of those we knew,"

30046,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The fatal asterisk of death is set,"
30047,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Ye I salute!  The horologe of Time
30048,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Strikes the half-century with a solemn chime,"
30049,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And summons us together once again,"
30050,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,The joy of meeting not unmixed with pain.
30051,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30052,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Where are the others?  Voices from the deep
30053,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Caverns of darkness answer me: ""They sleep!"""
30054,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,I name no names; instinctively I feel
30055,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Each at some well-remembered grave will kneel,"
30056,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And from the inscription wipe the weeds and moss,"
30057,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,For every heart best knoweth its own loss.
30058,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,I see their scattered gravestones gleaming white
30059,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Through the pale dusk of the impending night;
30060,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,O'er all alike the impartial sunset throws
30061,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Its golden lilies mingled with the rose;
30062,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"We give to each a tender thought, and pass"
30063,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Out of the graveyards with their tangled grass,"
30064,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Unto these scenes frequented by our feet
30065,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"When we were young, and life was fresh and sweet."
30066,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30067,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,What shall I say to you?  What can I say
30068,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Better than silence is?  When I survey
30069,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"This throng of faces turned to meet my own,"
30070,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Friendly and fair, and yet to me unknown,"
30071,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Transformed the very landscape seems to be;
30072,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"It is the same, yet not the same to me."
30073,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"So many memories crowd upon my brain,"
30074,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"So many ghosts are in the wooded plain,"
30075,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"I fain would steal away, with noiseless tread,"
30076,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,As from a house where some one lieth dead.
30077,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,I cannot go;--I pause;--I hesitate;
30078,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,My feet reluctant linger at the gate;
30079,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,As one who struggles in a troubled dream
30080,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"To speak and cannot, to myself I seem."
30081,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30082,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Vanish the dream! Vanish the idle fears!

30084,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Whatever time or space may intervene,"
30085,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,I will not be a stranger in this scene.
30086,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Here every doubt, all indecision, ends;"
30087,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Hail, my companions, comrades, classmates, friends!"
30088,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30089,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Ah me! the fifty years since last we met
30090,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Seem to me fifty folios bound and set
30091,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"By Time, the great transcriber, on his shelves,"
30092,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Wherein are written the histories of ourselves.
30093,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What tragedies, what comedies, are there;"
30094,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What joy and grief, what rapture and despair!"
30095,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What chronicles of triumph and defeat,"
30096,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Of struggle, and temptation, and retreat!"
30097,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What records of regrets, and doubts, and fears"
30098,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What pages blotted, blistered by our tears!"
30099,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What lovely landscapes on the margin shine,"
30100,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"What sweet, angelic faces, what divine"
30101,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And holy images of love and trust,"

30106,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Not mine.  With reverential feet I pass;
30107,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"I hear a voice that cries, ""Alas! alas!"
30108,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Whatever hath been written shall remain,"
30109,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Nor be erased nor written o'er again;
30110,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,The unwritten only still belongs to thee:
30111,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Take heed, and ponder well what that shall be."""

30114,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Are reassured if some one reads aloud
30115,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"A tale of wonder, with enchantment fraught,"
30116,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Or wild adventure, that diverts their thought,"
30117,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Let me endeavor with a tale to chase
30118,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The gathering shadows of the time and place,"
30119,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,And banish what we all too deeply feel
30120,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Wholly to say, or wholly to conceal."
30121,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30122,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"In mediaeval Rome, I know not where,"
30123,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"There stood an image with its arm in air,"
30124,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And on its lifted finger, shining clear,"
30125,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"A golden ring with the device, ""Strike here!"""
30126,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Greatly the people wondered, though none guessed"
30127,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The meaning that these words but half expressed,"
30128,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Until a learned clerk, who at noonday"
30129,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"With downcast eyes was passing on his way,"
30130,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Paused, and observed the spot, and marked it well,"
30131,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Whereon the shadow of the finger fell;
30132,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And, coming back at midnight, delved, and found"
30133,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,A secret stairway leading under ground.
30134,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Down this he passed into a spacious hall,"
30135,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Lit by a flaming jewel on the wall;
30136,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,And opposite in threatening attitude
30137,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,With bow and shaft a brazen statue stood.
30138,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Upon its forehead, like a coronet,"
30139,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Were these mysterious words of menace set:
30140,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"""That which I am, I am; my fatal aim"
30141,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"None can escape, not even yon luminous flame!"""
30142,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30143,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Midway the hall was a fair table placed,"
30144,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"With cloth of gold, and golden cups enchased"
30145,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"With rubies, and the plates and knives were gold,"
30146,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,And gold the bread and viands manifold.
30147,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Around it, silent, motionless, and sad,"
30148,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Were seated gallant knights in armor clad,"
30149,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And ladies beautiful with plume and zone,"
30150,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"But they were stone, their hearts within were stone;"
30151,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,And the vast hall was filled in every part
30152,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"With silent crowds, stony in face and heart."
30153,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30154,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Long at the scene, bewildered and amazed"
30155,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,The trembling clerk in speechless wonder gazed;
30156,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Then from the table, by his greed made bold,"
30157,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"He seized a goblet and a knife of gold,"
30158,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"And suddenly from their seats the guests upsprang,"
30159,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The vaulted ceiling with loud clamors rang,"
30160,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The archer sped his arrow, at their call,"
30161,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Shattering the lambent jewel on the wall,"
30162,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,And all was dark around and overhead;--
30163,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Stark on the door the luckless clerk lay dead!
30164,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30165,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,The writer of this legend then records
30166,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Its ghostly application in these words:
30167,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The image is the Adversary old,"
30168,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Whose beckoning finger points to realms of gold;
30169,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Our lusts and passions are the downward stair
30170,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,That leads the soul from a diviner air;
30171,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The archer, Death; the flaming jewel, Life;"
30172,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"Terrestrial goods, the goblet and the knife;"
30173,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The knights and ladies, all whose flesh and bone"
30174,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,By avarice have been hardened into stone;
30175,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The clerk, the scholar whom the love of pelf"
30176,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,Tempts from his books and from his nobler self.
30177,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,
30178,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The scholar and the world!  The endless strife,"
30179,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,The discord in the harmonies of life!
30180,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The love of learning, the sequestered nooks,"
30181,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,And all the sweet serenity of books;
30182,IN BOWDOIN COLLEGE,"The market-place, the eager love of gain,"

31327,AMALFI,On its terraced walk aloof
31328,AMALFI,"Leans a monk with folded hands,"
31329,AMALFI,"Placid, satisfied, serene,"
31330,AMALFI,Looking down upon the scene
31331,AMALFI,Over wall and red-tiled roof;
31332,AMALFI,Wondering unto what good end
31333,AMALFI,"All this toil and traffic tend,"
31334,AMALFI,And why all men cannot be
31335,AMALFI,"Free from care and free from pain,"
31336,AMALFI,"And the sordid love of gain,"
31337,AMALFI,And as indolent as he.
31338,AMALFI,
31339,AMALFI,Where are now the freighted barks
31340,AMALFI,From the marts of east and west?
31341,AMALFI,Where the knights in iron sarks
31342,AMALFI,"Journeying to the Holy Land,"
31343,AMALFI,"Glove of steel upon the hand,"
31344,AMALFI,Cross of crimson on the breast?
31345,AMALFI,Where the pomp of camp and court?
31346,AMALFI,Where the pilgrims with their prayers?
31347,AMALFI,"Where the merchants with their wares,"
31348,AMALFI,And their gallant brigantines
31349,AMALFI,Sailing safely into port
31350,AMALFI,Chased by corsair Algerines?
31351,AMALFI,
31352,AMALFI,"Vanished like a fleet of cloud,"
31353,AMALFI,"Like a passing trumpet-blast,"
31354,AMALFI,"Are those splendors of the past,"
31355,AMALFI,And the commerce and the crowd!
31356,AMALFI,Fathoms deep beneath the seas
31357,AMALFI,"Lie the ancient wharves and quays,"
31358,AMALFI,Swallowed by the engulfing waves;
31359,AMALFI,"Silent streets and vacant halls,"
31360,AMALFI,Ruined roofs and towers and walls;
31361,AMALFI,Hidden from all mortal eyes
31362,AMALFI,Deep the sunken city lies:
31363,AMALFI,Even cities have their graves!
31364,AMALFI,
31365,AMALFI,This is an enchanted land!
31366,AMALFI,Round the headlands far away
31367,AMALFI,Sweeps the blue Salernian bay
31368,AMALFI,With its sickle of white sand:
31369,AMALFI,Further still and furthermost
31370,AMALFI,On the dim discovered coast
31371,AMALFI,"Paestum with its ruins lies,"
31372,AMALFI,And its roses all in bloom
31373,AMALFI,Seem to tinge the fatal skies
31374,AMALFI,Of that lonely land of doom.
31375,AMALFI,
31376,AMALFI,"On his terrace, high in air,"
31377,AMALFI,Nothing doth the good monk care
31378,AMALFI,"For such worldly themes as these,"
31379,AMALFI,From the garden just below
31380,AMALFI,"Little puffs of perfume blow,"
31381,AMALFI,And a sound is in his ears
31382,AMALFI,Of the murmur of the bees
31383,AMALFI,In the shining chestnut-trees;
31384,AMALFI,Nothing else he heeds or hears.
31385,AMALFI,All the landscape seems to swoon
31386,AMALFI,In the happy afternoon;
31387,AMALFI,Slowly o'er his senses creep
31388,AMALFI,"The encroaching waves of sleep,"
31389,AMALFI,"And he sinks as sank the town,"
31390,AMALFI,"Unresisting, fathoms down,"
31391,AMALFI,Into caverns cool and deep!
31392,AMALFI,
31393,AMALFI,"Walled about with drifts of snow,"
31394,AMALFI,"Hearing the fierce north-wind blow,"
31395,AMALFI,"Seeing all the landscape white,"
31396,AMALFI,"And the river cased in ice,"
31397,AMALFI,"Comes this memory of delight,"
31398,AMALFI,Comes this vision unto me
31399,AMALFI,Of a long-lost Paradise
31400,AMALFI,In the land beyond the sea.

31462,BELISARIUS,It was for him I chased

31474,BELISARIUS,Like dust in a windy street.
31475,BELISARIUS,
31476,BELISARIUS,For him I won again
31477,BELISARIUS,"The Ausonian realm and reign,"
31478,BELISARIUS,Rome and Parthenope;
31479,BELISARIUS,And all the land was mine
31480,BELISARIUS,From the summits of Apennine

31509,BELISARIUS,Hollow and restless and loud.

31582,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel?  Turn round and round"
31583,KERAMOS,"Without a pause, without a sound:"
31584,KERAMOS,So spins the flying world away!
31585,KERAMOS,"This clay, well mixed with marl and sand,"
31586,KERAMOS,Follows the motion of my hand;
31587,KERAMOS,"Far some must follow, and some command,"
31588,KERAMOS,Though all are made of clay!
31589,KERAMOS,
31590,KERAMOS,Thus sang the Potter at his task
31591,KERAMOS,"Beneath the blossoming hawthorn-tree,"
31592,KERAMOS,"While o'er his features, like a mask,"
31593,KERAMOS,The quilted sunshine and leaf-shade
31594,KERAMOS,"Moved, as the boughs above him swayed,"
31595,KERAMOS,"And clothed him, till he seemed to be"
31596,KERAMOS,"A figure woven in tapestry,"
31597,KERAMOS,So sumptuously was he arrayed
31598,KERAMOS,In that magnificent attire
31599,KERAMOS,Of sable tissue flaked with fire.
31600,KERAMOS,"Like a magician he appeared,"
31601,KERAMOS,A conjurer without book or beard;
31602,KERAMOS,And while he plied his magic art--
31603,KERAMOS,For it was magical to me--
31604,KERAMOS,"I stood in silence and apart,"
31605,KERAMOS,And wondered more and more to see
31606,KERAMOS,"That shapeless, lifeless mass of clay"
31607,KERAMOS,"Rise up to meet the master's hand,"
31608,KERAMOS,"And now contract and now expand,"
31609,KERAMOS,And even his slightest touch obey;
31610,KERAMOS,While ever in a thoughtful mood
31611,KERAMOS,"He sang his ditty, and at times"
31612,KERAMOS,"Whistled a tune between the rhymes,"
31613,KERAMOS,As a melodious interlude.
31614,KERAMOS,
31615,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel!  All things must change"
31616,KERAMOS,"To something new, to something strange;"
31617,KERAMOS,Nothing that is can pause or stay;
31618,KERAMOS,"The moon will wax, the moon will wane,"
31619,KERAMOS,"The mist and cloud will turn to rain,"

31621,KERAMOS,To-morrow be to-day.
31622,KERAMOS,
31623,KERAMOS,"Thus still the Potter sang, and still,"
31624,KERAMOS,"By some unconscious act of will,"
31625,KERAMOS,The melody and even the words
31626,KERAMOS,Were intermingled with my thought
31627,KERAMOS,As bits of colored thread are caught
31628,KERAMOS,And woven into nests of birds.
31629,KERAMOS,"And thus to regions far remote,"

31631,KERAMOS,This wizard in the motley coat
31632,KERAMOS,"Transported me on wings of song,"

31634,KERAMOS,Bore me with restless speed along.
31635,KERAMOS,What land is this that seems to be
31636,KERAMOS,A mingling of the land and sea?
31637,KERAMOS,"This land of sluices, dikes, and dunes?"
31638,KERAMOS,"This water-net, that tessellates"
31639,KERAMOS,The landscape? this unending maze
31640,KERAMOS,"Of gardens, through whose latticed gates"
31641,KERAMOS,The imprisoned pinks and tulips gaze;
31642,KERAMOS,Where in long summer afternoons
31643,KERAMOS,"The sunshine, softened by the haze,"
31644,KERAMOS,Comes streaming down as through a screen;
31645,KERAMOS,Where over fields and pastures green
31646,KERAMOS,"The painted ships float high in air,"
31647,KERAMOS,And over all and everywhere
31648,KERAMOS,The sails of windmills sink and soar
31649,KERAMOS,Like wings of sea-gulls on the shore?
31650,KERAMOS,
31651,KERAMOS,What land is this? Yon pretty town

31657,KERAMOS,From plates that on the dresser shine;
31658,KERAMOS,"Flagons to foam with Flemish beer,"
31659,KERAMOS,"Or sparkle with the Rhenish wine,"
31660,KERAMOS,"And pilgrim flasks with fleurs-de-lis,"
31661,KERAMOS,"And ships upon a rolling sea,"
31662,KERAMOS,"And tankards pewter topped, and queer"
31663,KERAMOS,With comic mask and musketeer!
31664,KERAMOS,Each hospitable chimney smiles
31665,KERAMOS,A welcome from its painted tiles;
31666,KERAMOS,"The parlor walls, the chamber floors,"
31667,KERAMOS,"The stairways and the corridors,"
31668,KERAMOS,"The borders of the garden walks,"
31669,KERAMOS,"Are beautiful with fadeless flowers,"

31673,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel!  All life is brief;"

31675,KERAMOS,What now is leaf will soon decay;
31676,KERAMOS,"The wind blows east, the wind blows west;"
31677,KERAMOS,The blue eyes in the robin's nest
31678,KERAMOS,"Will soon have wings and beak and breast,"
31679,KERAMOS,And flutter and fly away.
31680,KERAMOS,
31681,KERAMOS,"Now southward through the air I glide,"
31682,KERAMOS,"The song my only pursuivant,"
31683,KERAMOS,And see across the landscape wide
31684,KERAMOS,"The blue Charente, upon whose tide"
31685,KERAMOS,The belfries and the spires of Saintes
31686,KERAMOS,"Ripple and rock from side to side,"
31687,KERAMOS,"As, when an earthquake rends its walls,"

31694,KERAMOS,Whose figulines and rustic wares
31695,KERAMOS,Scarce find him bread from day to day?
31696,KERAMOS,"This madman, as the people say,"
31697,KERAMOS,Who breaks his tables and his chairs
31698,KERAMOS,"To feed his furnace fires, nor cares"
31699,KERAMOS,"Who goes unfed if they are fed,"
31700,KERAMOS,Nor who may live if they are dead?
31701,KERAMOS,This alchemist with hollow cheeks
31702,KERAMOS,"And sunken, searching eyes, who seeks,"
31703,KERAMOS,By mingled earths and ores combined
31704,KERAMOS,"With potency of fire, to find"
31705,KERAMOS,"Some new enamel, hard and bright,"
31706,KERAMOS,"His dream, his passion, his delight?"
31707,KERAMOS,
31708,KERAMOS,O Palissy! within thy breast

31710,KERAMOS,"Thine was the prophets vision, thine"
31711,KERAMOS,"The exultation, the divine"
31712,KERAMOS,"Insanity of noble minds,"
31713,KERAMOS,"That never falters nor abates,"
31714,KERAMOS,"But labors and endures and waits,"
31715,KERAMOS,"Till all that it foresees it finds,"
31716,KERAMOS,Or what it cannot find creates!
31717,KERAMOS,
31718,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel!  This earthen jar"
31719,KERAMOS,"A touch can make, a touch can mar;"
31720,KERAMOS,"And shall it to the Potter say,"
31721,KERAMOS,What makest thou.  Thou hast no hand?
31722,KERAMOS,As men who think to understand
31723,KERAMOS,"A world by their Creator planned,"
31724,KERAMOS,Who wiser is than they.
31725,KERAMOS,
31726,KERAMOS,"Still guided by the dreamy song,"
31727,KERAMOS,As in a trance I float along
31728,KERAMOS,"Above the Pyrenean chain,"
31729,KERAMOS,"Above the fields and farms of Spain,"
31730,KERAMOS,"Above the bright Majorcan isle,"
31731,KERAMOS,"That lends its softened name to art,--"
31732,KERAMOS,"A spot, a dot upon the chart,"
31733,KERAMOS,"Whose little towns, red-roofed with tile,"

31736,KERAMOS,And crowned by day with wreaths of smoke.
31737,KERAMOS,"Then eastward, wafted in my flight"
31738,KERAMOS,"On my enchanter's magic cloak,"
31739,KERAMOS,I sail across the Tyrrhene Sea
31740,KERAMOS,"Into the land of Italy,"
31741,KERAMOS,"And o'er the windy Apennines,"
31742,KERAMOS,Mantled and musical with pines.
31743,KERAMOS,
31744,KERAMOS,"The palaces, the princely halls,"
31745,KERAMOS,The doors of houses and the walls
31746,KERAMOS,"Of churches and of belfry towers,"
31747,KERAMOS,"Cloister and castle, street and mart,"
31748,KERAMOS,Are garlanded and gay with flowers
31749,KERAMOS,That blossom in the fields of art.
31750,KERAMOS,Here Gubbio's workshops gleam and glow
31751,KERAMOS,"With brilliant, iridescent dyes,"
31752,KERAMOS,"The dazzling whiteness of the snow,"
31753,KERAMOS,The cobalt blue of summer skies;
31754,KERAMOS,"And vase and scutcheon, cup and plate,"
31755,KERAMOS,In perfect finish emulate
31756,KERAMOS,"Faenza, Florence, Pesaro."
31757,KERAMOS,
31758,KERAMOS,Forth from Urbino's gate there came
31759,KERAMOS,A youth with the angelic name
31760,KERAMOS,"Of Raphael, in form and face"
31761,KERAMOS,"Himself angelic, and divine"
31762,KERAMOS,In arts of color and design.
31763,KERAMOS,From him Francesco Xanto caught
31764,KERAMOS,"Something of his transcendent grace,"
31765,KERAMOS,And into fictile fabrics wrought
31766,KERAMOS,Suggestions of the master's thought.
31767,KERAMOS,Nor less Maestro Giorgio shines
31768,KERAMOS,With madre-perl and golden lines
31769,KERAMOS,"Of arabesques, and interweaves"
31770,KERAMOS,His birds and fruits and flowers and leaves
31771,KERAMOS,"About some landscape, shaded brown,"
31772,KERAMOS,With olive tints on rock and town.
31773,KERAMOS,"Behold this cup within whose bowl,"
31774,KERAMOS,Upon a ground of deepest blue
31775,KERAMOS,"With yellow-lustred stars o'erlaid,"
31776,KERAMOS,Colors of every tint and hue
31777,KERAMOS,Mingle in one harmonious whole!
31778,KERAMOS,"With large blue eyes and steadfast gaze,"
31779,KERAMOS,"Her yellow hair in net and braid,"
31780,KERAMOS,Necklace and ear-rings all ablaze
31781,KERAMOS,"With golden lustre o'er the glaze,"
31782,KERAMOS,"A woman's portrait; on the scroll,"
31783,KERAMOS,"Cana, the Beautiful!  A name"
31784,KERAMOS,Forgotten save for such brief fame
31785,KERAMOS,"As this memorial can bestow,--"
31786,KERAMOS,A gift some lover long ago
31787,KERAMOS,Gave with his heart to this fair dame.
31788,KERAMOS,
31789,KERAMOS,A nobler title to renown
31790,KERAMOS,"Is thine, O pleasant Tuscan town,"
31791,KERAMOS,Seated beside the Arno's stream;
31792,KERAMOS,For Lucca della Robbia there
31793,KERAMOS,"Created forms so wondrous fair,"
31794,KERAMOS,They made thy sovereignty supreme.
31795,KERAMOS,"These choristers with lips of stone,"
31796,KERAMOS,"Whose music is not heard, but seen,"
31797,KERAMOS,"Still chant, as from their organ-screen,"
31798,KERAMOS,"Their Maker's praise; nor these alone,"
31799,KERAMOS,"But the more fragile forms of clay,"
31800,KERAMOS,"Hardly less beautiful than they,"
31801,KERAMOS,These saints and angels that adorn
31802,KERAMOS,"The walls of hospitals, and tell"
31803,KERAMOS,The story of good deeds so well
31804,KERAMOS,"That poverty seems less forlorn,"
31805,KERAMOS,And life more like a holiday.
31806,KERAMOS,
31807,KERAMOS,"Here in this old neglected church,"
31808,KERAMOS,"That long eludes the traveller's search,"
31809,KERAMOS,Lies the dead bishop on his tomb;
31810,KERAMOS,"Earth upon earth he slumbering lies,"
31811,KERAMOS,Life-like and death-like in the gloom;
31812,KERAMOS,Garlands of fruit and flowers in bloom
31813,KERAMOS,And foliage deck his resting place;
31814,KERAMOS,"A shadow in the sightless eyes,"
31815,KERAMOS,"A pallor on the patient face,"
31816,KERAMOS,Made perfect by the furnace heat;
31817,KERAMOS,All earthly passions and desires
31818,KERAMOS,Burnt out by purgatorial fires;
31819,KERAMOS,"Seeming to say, ""Our years are fleet,"
31820,KERAMOS,"And to the weary death is sweet."""
31821,KERAMOS,
31822,KERAMOS,But the most wonderful of all
31823,KERAMOS,The ornaments on tomb or wall
31824,KERAMOS,That grace the fair Ausonian shores
31825,KERAMOS,"Are those the faithful earth restores,"
31826,KERAMOS,"Near some Apulian town concealed,"
31827,KERAMOS,"In vineyard or in harvest field,--"
31828,KERAMOS,"Vases and urns and bas-reliefs,"
31829,KERAMOS,"Memorials of forgotten griefs,"
31830,KERAMOS,Or records of heroic deeds
31831,KERAMOS,Of demigods and mighty chiefs:
31832,KERAMOS,"Figures that almost move and speak,"
31833,KERAMOS,"And, buried amid mould and weeds,"
31834,KERAMOS,Still in their attitudes attest
31835,KERAMOS,"The presence of the graceful Greek,--"
31836,KERAMOS,"Achilles in his armor dressed,"
31837,KERAMOS,"Alcides with the Cretan bull,"
31838,KERAMOS,"And Aphrodite with her boy,"
31839,KERAMOS,"Or lovely Helena of Troy,"
31840,KERAMOS,Still living and still beautiful.
31841,KERAMOS,
31842,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel!  'T is nature's plan"
31843,KERAMOS,"The child should grow into the man,"
31844,KERAMOS,"The man grow wrinkled, old, and gray;"
31845,KERAMOS,"In youth the heart exults and sings,"
31846,KERAMOS,"The pulses leap, the feet have wings;"
31847,KERAMOS,"In age the cricket chirps, and brings"
31848,KERAMOS,The harvest home of day.
31849,KERAMOS,
31850,KERAMOS,"And now the winds that southward blow,"
31851,KERAMOS,"And cool the hot Sicilian isle,"
31852,KERAMOS,Bear me away.  I see below
31853,KERAMOS,"The long line of the Libyan Nile,"
31854,KERAMOS,Flooding and feeding the parched land
31855,KERAMOS,"With annual ebb and overflow,"
31856,KERAMOS,A fallen palm whose branches lie
31857,KERAMOS,"Beneath the Abyssinian sky,"
31858,KERAMOS,"Whose roots are in Egyptian sands,"
31859,KERAMOS,"On either bank huge water-wheels,"
31860,KERAMOS,"Belted with jars and dripping weeds,"
31861,KERAMOS,"Send forth their melancholy moans,"
31862,KERAMOS,"As if, in their gray mantles hid,"
31863,KERAMOS,Dead anchorites of the Thebaid
31864,KERAMOS,"Knelt on the shore and told their beads,"
31865,KERAMOS,Beating their breasts with loud appeals
31866,KERAMOS,And penitential tears and groans.
31867,KERAMOS,
31868,KERAMOS,"This city, walled and thickly set"
31869,KERAMOS,"With glittering mosque and minaret,"
31870,KERAMOS,"Is Cairo, in whose gay bazaars"
31871,KERAMOS,The dreaming traveller first inhales
31872,KERAMOS,"The perfume of Arabian gales,"
31873,KERAMOS,"And sees the fabulous earthen jars,"
31874,KERAMOS,Huge as were those wherein the maid
31875,KERAMOS,Morgiana found the Forty Thieves
31876,KERAMOS,Concealed in midnight ambuscade;
31877,KERAMOS,"And seeing, more than half believes"
31878,KERAMOS,The fascinating tales that run
31879,KERAMOS,"Through all the Thousand Nights and One,"
31880,KERAMOS,Told by the fair Scheherezade.
31881,KERAMOS,
31882,KERAMOS,More strange and wonderful than these
31883,KERAMOS,"Are the Egyptian deities,"
31884,KERAMOS,"Ammonn, and Emeth, and the grand"
31885,KERAMOS,"Osiris, holding in his hand"
31886,KERAMOS,"The lotus; Isis, crowned and veiled;"
31887,KERAMOS,"The sacred Ibis, and the Sphinx;"
31888,KERAMOS,Bracelets with blue enamelled links;
31889,KERAMOS,"The Scarabee in emerald mailed,"
31890,KERAMOS,Or spreading wide his funeral wings;
31891,KERAMOS,Lamps that perchance their night-watch kept
31892,KERAMOS,"O'er Cleopatra while she slept,--"
31893,KERAMOS,All plundered from the tombs of kings.
31894,KERAMOS,
31895,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel!  The human race,"
31896,KERAMOS,"Of every tongue, of every place,"
31897,KERAMOS,"Caucasian, Coptic, or Malay,"
31898,KERAMOS,"All that inhabit this great earth,"
31899,KERAMOS,"Whatever be their rank or worth,"
31900,KERAMOS,"Are kindred and allied by birth,"
31901,KERAMOS,And made of the same clay.
31902,KERAMOS,
31903,KERAMOS,"O'er desert sands, o'er gulf and bay,"
31904,KERAMOS,"O'er Ganges and o'er Himalay,"
31905,KERAMOS,"Bird-like I fly, and flying sing,"
31906,KERAMOS,"To flowery kingdoms of Cathay,"
31907,KERAMOS,And bird-like poise on balanced wing
31908,KERAMOS,"Above the town of King-te-tching,"
31909,KERAMOS,"A burning town, or seeming so,--"
31910,KERAMOS,Three thousand furnaces that glow
31911,KERAMOS,"Incessantly, and fill the air"
31912,KERAMOS,"With smoke uprising, gyre on gyre"
31913,KERAMOS,"And painted by the lurid glare,"
31914,KERAMOS,Of jets and flashes of red fire.
31915,KERAMOS,
31916,KERAMOS,"As leaves that in the autumn fall,"
31917,KERAMOS,"Spotted and veined with various hues,"
31918,KERAMOS,"Are swept along the avenues,"
31919,KERAMOS,"And lie in heaps by hedge and wall,"
31920,KERAMOS,So from this grove of chimneys whirled
31921,KERAMOS,"To all the markets of the world,"
31922,KERAMOS,"These porcelain leaves are wafted on,--"
31923,KERAMOS,Light yellow leaves with spots and stains
31924,KERAMOS,"Of violet and of crimson dye,"
31925,KERAMOS,Or tender azure of a sky
31926,KERAMOS,"Just washed by gentle April rains,"
31927,KERAMOS,And beautiful with celadon.
31928,KERAMOS,
31929,KERAMOS,"Nor less the coarser household wares,--"
31930,KERAMOS,"The willow pattern, that we knew"
31931,KERAMOS,"In childhood, with its bridge of blue"
31932,KERAMOS,Leading to unknown thoroughfares;
31933,KERAMOS,The solitary man who stares
31934,KERAMOS,At the white river flowing through
31935,KERAMOS,"Its arches, the fantastic trees"
31936,KERAMOS,And wild perspective of the view;
31937,KERAMOS,And intermingled among these
31938,KERAMOS,The tiles that in our nurseries
31939,KERAMOS,"Filled us with wonder and delight,"
31940,KERAMOS,Or haunted us in dreams at night.
31941,KERAMOS,
31942,KERAMOS,"And yonder by Nankin, behold!"
31943,KERAMOS,"The Tower of Porcelain, strange and old,"
31944,KERAMOS,Uplifting to the astonished skies
31945,KERAMOS,"Its ninefold painted balconies,"
31946,KERAMOS,"With balustrades of twining leaves,"
31947,KERAMOS,"And roofs of tile, beneath whose eaves"
31948,KERAMOS,Hang porcelain bells that all the time
31949,KERAMOS,"Ring with a soft, melodious chime;"
31950,KERAMOS,While the whole fabric is ablaze
31951,KERAMOS,"With varied tints, all fused in one"
31952,KERAMOS,"Great mass of color, like a maze"
31953,KERAMOS,Of flowers illumined by the sun.
31954,KERAMOS,
31955,KERAMOS,"Turn, turn, my wheel!  What is begun"
31956,KERAMOS,"At daybreak must at dark be done,"
31957,KERAMOS,To-morrow will be another day;
31958,KERAMOS,To-morrow the hot furnace flame
31959,KERAMOS,"Will search the heart and try the frame,"
31960,KERAMOS,And stamp with honor or with shame
31961,KERAMOS,These vessels made of clay.
31962,KERAMOS,
31963,KERAMOS,"Cradled and rocked in Eastern seas,"
31964,KERAMOS,The islands of the Japanese
31965,KERAMOS,Beneath me lie; o'er lake and plain
31966,KERAMOS,"The stork, the heron, and the crane"
31967,KERAMOS,"Through the clear realms of azure drift,"
31968,KERAMOS,And on the hillside I can see
31969,KERAMOS,"The villages of Imari,"
31970,KERAMOS,Whose thronged and flaming workshops lift
31971,KERAMOS,"Their twisted columns of smoke on high,"
31972,KERAMOS,"Cloud cloisters that in ruins lie,"
31973,KERAMOS,"With sunshine streaming through each rift,"
31974,KERAMOS,And broken arches of blue sky.
31975,KERAMOS,
31976,KERAMOS,"All the bright flowers that fill the land,"
31977,KERAMOS,"Ripple of waves on rock or sand,"
31978,KERAMOS,"The snow on Fusiyama's cone,"
31979,KERAMOS,The midnight heaven so thickly sown
31980,KERAMOS,"With constellations of bright stars,"
31981,KERAMOS,"The leaves that rustle, the reeds that make"
31982,KERAMOS,"A whisper by each stream and lake,"
31983,KERAMOS,"The saffron dawn, the sunset red,"
31984,KERAMOS,Are painted on these lovely jars;
31985,KERAMOS,"Again the skylark sings, again"
31986,KERAMOS,"The stork, the heron, and the crane"
31987,KERAMOS,"Float through the azure overhead,"
31988,KERAMOS,The counterfeit and counterpart
31989,KERAMOS,Of Nature reproduced in Art.
31990,KERAMOS,
31991,KERAMOS,"Art is the child of Nature; yes,"
31992,KERAMOS,"Her darling child, in whom we trace"
31993,KERAMOS,"The features of the mother's face,"
31994,KERAMOS,"Her aspect and her attitude,"
31995,KERAMOS,All her majestic loveliness
31996,KERAMOS,Chastened and softened and subdued
31997,KERAMOS,"Into a more attractive grace,"
31998,KERAMOS,And with a human sense imbued.
31999,KERAMOS,"He is the greatest artist, then,"
32000,KERAMOS,"Whether of pencil or of pen,"
32001,KERAMOS,"Who follows Nature.  Never man,"
32002,KERAMOS,"As artist or as artisan,"
32003,KERAMOS,"Pursuing his own fantasies,"
32004,KERAMOS,"Can touch the human heart, or please,"
32005,KERAMOS,"Or satisfy our nobler needs,"
32006,KERAMOS,As he who sets his willing feet
32007,KERAMOS,"In Nature's footprints, light and fleet,"
32008,KERAMOS,And follows fearless where she leads.
32009,KERAMOS,
32010,KERAMOS,"Thus mused I on that morn in May,"
32011,KERAMOS,"Wrapped in my visions like the Seer,"
32012,KERAMOS,"Whose eyes behold not what is near,"
32013,KERAMOS,"But only what is far away,"
32014,KERAMOS,"When, suddenly sounding peal on peal,"
32015,KERAMOS,The church-bell from the neighboring town
32016,KERAMOS,Proclaimed the welcome hour of noon.
32017,KERAMOS,"The Potter heard, and stopped his wheel,"
32018,KERAMOS,"His apron on the grass threw down,"
32019,KERAMOS,"Whistled his quiet little tune,"
32020,KERAMOS,"Not overloud nor overlong,"
32021,KERAMOS,And ended thus his simple song:
32022,KERAMOS,
32023,KERAMOS,"Stop, stop, my wheel!  Too soon, too soon"
32024,KERAMOS,"The noon will be the afternoon,"
32025,KERAMOS,Too soon to-day be yesterday;
32026,KERAMOS,Behind us in our path we cast
32027,KERAMOS,"The broken potsherds of the past,"
32028,KERAMOS,"And all are ground to dust a last,"
32029,KERAMOS,And trodden into clay!

32915,BAYARD TAYLOR,
32916,BAYARD TAYLOR,So those volumes from their shelves
32917,BAYARD TAYLOR,"Watched him, silent as themselves."

33000,THE CHAMBER OVER THE GATE,"O Absalom, my son!"
33001,THE CHAMBER OVER THE GATE,
33002,THE CHAMBER OVER THE GATE,He goes forth from the door
33003,THE CHAMBER OVER THE GATE,Who shall return no more.
33004,THE CHAMBER OVER THE GATE,With him our joy departs;

33029,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,This splendid ebon throne?
33030,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Or by what reason, or what right divine,"
33031,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,Can I proclaim it mine?
33032,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33033,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Only, perhaps, by right divine of song"
33034,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,It may to me belong;
33035,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,Only because the spreading chestnut tree
33036,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,Of old was sung by me.
33037,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33038,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Well I remember it in all its prime,"
33039,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,When in the summer-time
33040,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,The affluent foliage of its branches made
33041,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,A cavern of cool shade.
33042,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33043,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"There, by the blacksmith's forge, beside the street,"
33044,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,Its blossoms white and sweet
33045,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Enticed the bees, until it seemed alive,"
33046,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,And murmured like a hive.
33047,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33048,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"And when the winds of autumn, with a shout,"
33049,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Tossed its great arms about,"
33050,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"The shining chestnuts, bursting from the sheath,"
33051,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,Dropped to the ground beneath.
33052,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33053,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"And now some fragments of its branches bare,"
33054,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Shaped as a stately chair,"
33055,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"Have by my hearthstone found a home at last,"
33056,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,And whisper of the past.
33057,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33058,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,The Danish king could not in all his pride

33063,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"I see again, as one in vision sees,"
33064,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"The blossoms and the bees,"
33065,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"And hear the children's voices shout and call,"
33066,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,And the brown chestnuts fall.
33067,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33068,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"I see the smithy with its fires aglow,"
33069,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"I hear the bellows blow,"
33070,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,And the shrill hammers on the anvil beat
33071,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,The iron white with heat!
33072,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33073,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"And thus, dear children, have ye made for me"
33074,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"This day a jubilee,"
33075,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,And to my more than three-score years and ten
33076,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,Brought back my youth again.
33077,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,
33078,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,"The heart hath its own memory, like the mind,"
33079,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,And in it are enshrined

33082,TO THE CHILDREN OF CAMBRIDGE,

33112,THE IRON PEN,"circlet of gold, inset with three precious stones from Siberia,"
33113,THE IRON PEN,"Ceylon, and Maine."
33114,THE IRON PEN,
33115,THE IRON PEN,I thought this Pen would arise
33116,THE IRON PEN,From the casket where it lies--
33117,THE IRON PEN,Of itself would arise and write
33118,THE IRON PEN,My thanks and my surprise.
33119,THE IRON PEN,
33120,THE IRON PEN,"When you gave it me under the pines,"
33121,THE IRON PEN,I dreamed these gems from the mines
33122,THE IRON PEN,"Of Siberia, Ceylon, and Maine"
33123,THE IRON PEN,Would glimmer as thoughts in the lines;
33124,THE IRON PEN,
33125,THE IRON PEN,That this iron link from the chain
33126,THE IRON PEN,Of Bonnivard might retain
33127,THE IRON PEN,Some verse of the Poet who sang
33128,THE IRON PEN,Of the prisoner and his pain;
33129,THE IRON PEN,
33130,THE IRON PEN,That this wood from the frigate's mast
33131,THE IRON PEN,"Might write me a rhyme at last,"
33132,THE IRON PEN,As it used to write on the sky
33133,THE IRON PEN,The song of the sea and the blast.
33134,THE IRON PEN,
33135,THE IRON PEN,"But motionless as I wait,"
33136,THE IRON PEN,Like a Bishop lying in state
33137,THE IRON PEN,"Lies the Pen, with its mitre of gold,"
33138,THE IRON PEN,And its jewels inviolate.
33139,THE IRON PEN,
33140,THE IRON PEN,"Then must I speak, and say"
33141,THE IRON PEN,That the light of that summer day
33142,THE IRON PEN,In the garden under the pines
33143,THE IRON PEN,Shall not fade and pass away.
33144,THE IRON PEN,
33145,THE IRON PEN,"I shall see you standing there,"
33146,THE IRON PEN,"Caressed by the fragrant air,"
33147,THE IRON PEN,"With the shadow on your face,"
33148,THE IRON PEN,And the sunshine on your hair.
33149,THE IRON PEN,
33150,THE IRON PEN,I shall hear the sweet low tone
33151,THE IRON PEN,"Of a voice before unknown,"
33152,THE IRON PEN,"Saying, ""This is from me to you--"
33153,THE IRON PEN,"From me, and to you alone."""
33154,THE IRON PEN,
33155,THE IRON PEN,And in words not idle and vain

33168,ROBERT BURNS,
33169,ROBERT BURNS,I see amid the fields of Ayr
33170,ROBERT BURNS,"A ploughman, who, in foul and fair,"
33171,ROBERT BURNS,Sings at his task
33172,ROBERT BURNS,"So clear, we know not if it is"
33173,ROBERT BURNS,"The laverock's song we hear, or his,"
33174,ROBERT BURNS,Nor care to ask.
33175,ROBERT BURNS,
33176,ROBERT BURNS,For him the ploughing of those fields
33177,ROBERT BURNS,A more ethereal harvest yields
33178,ROBERT BURNS,Than sheaves of grain;
33179,ROBERT BURNS,"Songs flush with Purple bloom the rye,"
33180,ROBERT BURNS,"The plover's call, the curlew's cry,"
33181,ROBERT BURNS,Sing in his brain.
33182,ROBERT BURNS,
33183,ROBERT BURNS,"Touched by his hand, the wayside weed"
33184,ROBERT BURNS,Becomes a flower; the lowliest reed
33185,ROBERT BURNS,Beside the stream
33186,ROBERT BURNS,Is clothed with beauty; gorse and grass
33187,ROBERT BURNS,"And heather, where his footsteps pass,"
33188,ROBERT BURNS,The brighter seem.
33189,ROBERT BURNS,
33190,ROBERT BURNS,"He sings of love, whose flame illumes"
33191,ROBERT BURNS,The darkness of lone cottage rooms;
33192,ROBERT BURNS,"He feels the force,"
33193,ROBERT BURNS,The treacherous undertow and stress
33194,ROBERT BURNS,"Of wayward passions, and no less"
33195,ROBERT BURNS,The keen remorse.
33196,ROBERT BURNS,
33197,ROBERT BURNS,"At moments, wrestling with his fate,"
33198,ROBERT BURNS,"His voice is harsh, but not with hate;"
33199,ROBERT BURNS,"The brushwood, hung"
33200,ROBERT BURNS,"Above the tavern door, lets fall"
33201,ROBERT BURNS,"Its bitter leaf, its drop of gall"
33202,ROBERT BURNS,Upon his tongue.
33203,ROBERT BURNS,
33204,ROBERT BURNS,But still the music of his song
33205,ROBERT BURNS,Rises o'er all elate and strong;
33206,ROBERT BURNS,Its master-chords
33207,ROBERT BURNS,"Are Manhood, Freedom, Brotherhood,"
33208,ROBERT BURNS,Its discords but an interlude
33209,ROBERT BURNS,Between the words.
33210,ROBERT BURNS,
33211,ROBERT BURNS,And then to die so young and leave
33212,ROBERT BURNS,Unfinished what he might achieve!
33213,ROBERT BURNS,Yet better sure
33214,ROBERT BURNS,"Is this, than wandering up and down"
33215,ROBERT BURNS,"An old man in a country town,"
33216,ROBERT BURNS,Infirm and poor.
33217,ROBERT BURNS,
33218,ROBERT BURNS,For now he haunts his native land
33219,ROBERT BURNS,As an immortal youth; his hand
33220,ROBERT BURNS,Guides every plough;
33221,ROBERT BURNS,"He sits beside each ingle-nook,"
33222,ROBERT BURNS,"His voice is in each rushing brook,"
33223,ROBERT BURNS,Each rustling bough.
33224,ROBERT BURNS,
33225,ROBERT BURNS,"His presence haunts this room to-night,"
33226,ROBERT BURNS,A form of mingled mist and light
33227,ROBERT BURNS,From that far coast.
33228,ROBERT BURNS,Welcome beneath this roof of mine!
33229,ROBERT BURNS,"Welcome! this vacant chair is thine,"
33230,ROBERT BURNS,Dear guest and ghost!

33236,HELEN OF TYRE,What phantom is this that appears
33237,HELEN OF TYRE,"Through the purple mist of the years,"
33238,HELEN OF TYRE,Itself but a mist like these?
33239,HELEN OF TYRE,A woman of cloud and of fire;
33240,HELEN OF TYRE,"It is she; it is Helen of Tyre,"
33241,HELEN OF TYRE,The town in the midst of the seas.
33242,HELEN OF TYRE,
33243,HELEN OF TYRE,O Tyre! in thy crowded streets
33244,HELEN OF TYRE,"The phantom appears and retreats,"
33245,HELEN OF TYRE,And the Israelites that sell
33246,HELEN OF TYRE,"Thy lilies and lions of brass,"
33247,HELEN OF TYRE,"Look up as they see her pass,"
33248,HELEN OF TYRE,"And murmur ""Jezebel!"""
33249,HELEN OF TYRE,
33250,HELEN OF TYRE,Then another phantom is seen
33251,HELEN OF TYRE,"At her side, in a gray gabardine,"
33252,HELEN OF TYRE,With beard that floats to his waist;
33253,HELEN OF TYRE,"It is Simon Magus, the Seer;"
33254,HELEN OF TYRE,"He speaks, and she pauses to hear"
33255,HELEN OF TYRE,The words he utters in haste.
33256,HELEN OF TYRE,
33257,HELEN OF TYRE,"He says: ""From this evil fame,"
33258,HELEN OF TYRE,"From this life of sorrow and shame,"
33259,HELEN OF TYRE,I will lift thee and make thee mine;
33260,HELEN OF TYRE,"Thou hast been Queen Candace,"
33261,HELEN OF TYRE,"And Helen of Troy, and shalt be"
33262,HELEN OF TYRE,"The Intelligence Divine!"""
33263,HELEN OF TYRE,
33264,HELEN OF TYRE,"Oh, sweet as the breath of morn,"
33265,HELEN OF TYRE,To the fallen and forlorn
33266,HELEN OF TYRE,Are whispered words of praise;
33267,HELEN OF TYRE,For the famished heart believes
33268,HELEN OF TYRE,"The falsehood that tempts and deceives,"
33269,HELEN OF TYRE,And the promise that betrays.
33270,HELEN OF TYRE,
33271,HELEN OF TYRE,So she follows from land to land
33272,HELEN OF TYRE,"The wizard's beckoning hand,"
33273,HELEN OF TYRE,"As a leaf is blown by the gust,"
33274,HELEN OF TYRE,Till she vanishes into night.
33275,HELEN OF TYRE,"O reader, stoop down and write"
33276,HELEN OF TYRE,With thy finger in the dust.
33277,HELEN OF TYRE,
33278,HELEN OF TYRE,"O town in the midst of the seas,"
33279,HELEN OF TYRE,"With thy rafts of cedar trees,"
33280,HELEN OF TYRE,"Thy merchandise and thy ships,"
33281,HELEN OF TYRE,"Thou, too, art become as naught,"
33282,HELEN OF TYRE,"A phantom, a shadow, a thought,"
33283,HELEN OF TYRE,A name upon men's lips.

39134,JOACHIM.,"In the first Age, the early prime"
39135,JOACHIM.,"And dawn of all historic time,"
39136,JOACHIM.,The Father reigned; and face to face
39137,JOACHIM.,He spake with the primeval race.
39138,JOACHIM.,"Bright Angels, on his errands sent,"
39139,JOACHIM.,Sat with the patriarch in his tent;
39140,JOACHIM.,His prophets thundered in the street;
39141,JOACHIM.,"His lightnings flashed, his hailstorms beat;"
39142,JOACHIM.,"In earthquake and in flood and flame,"
39143,JOACHIM.,In tempest and in cloud He came!
39144,JOACHIM.,The fear of God is in his Book;
39145,JOACHIM.,The pages of the Pentateuch
39146,JOACHIM.,Are full of the terror of his name.
39147,JOACHIM.,
39148,JOACHIM.,Then reigned the Son; his Covenant
39149,JOACHIM.,"Was peace on earth, good-will to man;"
39150,JOACHIM.,With Him the reign of Law began.
39151,JOACHIM.,"He was the Wisdom and the Word,"
39152,JOACHIM.,"And sent his Angels Ministrant,"
39153,JOACHIM.,"Unterrified and undeterred,"
39154,JOACHIM.,"To rescue souls forlorn and lost,"
39155,JOACHIM.,"The troubled, tempted, tempest-tost"
39156,JOACHIM.,"To heal, to comfort, and to teach."
39157,JOACHIM.,The fiery tongues of Pentecost
39158,JOACHIM.,"His symbols were, that they should preach"

39163,JOACHIM.,"Shine through the darkness of our days,"
39164,JOACHIM.,And touch with their celestial fires
39165,JOACHIM.,Our churches and our convent spires.
39166,JOACHIM.,His Book is the New Testament.

39177,JOACHIM.,Already from the streets and marts
39178,JOACHIM.,"Of town and traffic, and low cares,"
39179,JOACHIM.,Men climb the consecrated stairs
39180,JOACHIM.,"With weary feet, and bleeding hearts;"
39181,JOACHIM.,"And leave the world and its delights,"
39182,JOACHIM.,"Its passions, struggles, and despairs,"
39183,JOACHIM.,For contemplation and for prayers
39184,JOACHIM.,In cloister-cells of coenobites.

39190,JOACHIM.,"In the Land of Labor, thine eagle's nest!"
39191,JOACHIM.,May I be found not derelict

39193,JOACHIM.,"If I have written, in many a page,"

39205,JOACHIM.,"The things that have been and shall be,"
39206,JOACHIM.,"Conscious of right, nor fearing wrong;"
39207,JOACHIM.,"Because I am in love with Love,"
39208,JOACHIM.,And the sole thing I hate is Hate;
39209,JOACHIM.,"For Hate is death; and Love is life,"
39210,JOACHIM.,"A peace, a splendor from above;"
39211,JOACHIM.,"And Hate, a never-ending strife,"
39212,JOACHIM.,"A smoke, a blackness from the abyss"
39213,JOACHIM.,Where unclean serpents coil and hiss!
39214,JOACHIM.,Love is the Holy Ghost within
39215,JOACHIM.,Hate the unpardonable sin!

39437,LUCIFER.,Yes; very nearly.

39440,LUCIFER.,"Such an unnatural, strange proceeding,"
39441,LUCIFER.,By showing conclusively and clearly
39442,LUCIFER.,"That death is a stupid blunder merely,"
39443,LUCIFER.,And not a necessity of our lives.
39444,LUCIFER.,My being here is accidental;
39445,LUCIFER.,"The storm, that against your casement drives,"

39497,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
39498,PRINCE HENRY.,"Ay, whole schools"

39525,PRINCE HENRY.,"And give her life as the price of yours!"""
39526,PRINCE HENRY.,

39730,THE ANGEL.,O thou voice within my breast!
39731,THE ANGEL.,"Why entreat me, why upbraid me,"

39759,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39760,HUBERT.,How sad the grand old castle looks!
39761,HUBERT.,"O'erhead, the unmolested rooks"
39762,HUBERT.,Upon the turret's windy top
39763,HUBERT.,"Sit, talking of the farmer's crop"
39764,HUBERT.,"Here in the court-yard springs the grass,"
39765,HUBERT.,So few are now the feet that pass;
39766,HUBERT.,"The stately peacocks, bolder grown,"
39767,HUBERT.,"Come hopping down the steps of stone,"
39768,HUBERT.,As if the castle were their own;
39769,HUBERT.,"And I, the poor old seneschal,"
39770,HUBERT.,"Haunt, like a ghost, the banquet-hall."
39771,HUBERT.,Alas! the merry guests no more
39772,HUBERT.,Crowd through the hospitable door;
39773,HUBERT.,"No eyes with youth and passion shine,"
39774,HUBERT.,No cheeks glow redder than the wine;
39775,HUBERT.,"No song, no laugh, no jovial din"
39776,HUBERT.,Of drinking wassail to the pin;
39777,HUBERT.,"But all is silent, sad, and drear,"
39778,HUBERT.,And now the only sounds I hear
39779,HUBERT.,"Are the hoarse rooks upon the walls,"
39780,HUBERT.,And horses stamping in their stalls!
39781,HUBERT.,
39782,HUBERT.,A horn sounds.
39783,HUBERT.,
39784,HUBERT.,"What ho! that merry, sudden blast"
39785,HUBERT.,Reminds me of the days long past!
39786,HUBERT.,"And, as of old resounding, grate"
39787,HUBERT.,"The heavy hinges of the gate,"
39788,HUBERT.,"And, clattering loud, with iron clank,"
39789,HUBERT.,"Down goes the sounding bridge of plank,"
39790,HUBERT.,As if it were in haste to greet
39791,HUBERT.,The pressure of a traveller's feet!
39792,HUBERT.,
39793,HUBERT.,Enter WALTER the Minnesinger.
39794,HUBERT.,
39795,WALTER.,WALTER.
39796,WALTER.,"How now, my friend!  This looks quite lonely!"
39797,WALTER.,"No banner flying from the walls,"
39798,WALTER.,"No pages and no seneschals,"
39799,WALTER.,"No warders, and one porter only!"
39800,WALTER.,"Is it you, Hubert?"

39802,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39803,HUBERT.,Ah! Master Walter!
39804,HUBERT.,
39805,WALTER.,WALTER.
39806,WALTER.,Alas! how forms and faces alter!
39807,WALTER.,I did not know you.  You look older!
39808,WALTER.,"Your hair has grown much grayer and thinner,"
39809,WALTER.,And you stoop a little in the shoulder!
39810,WALTER.,
39811,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39812,HUBERT.,"Alack!  I am a poor old sinner,"
39813,HUBERT.,"And, like these towers, begin to moulder;"
39814,HUBERT.,And you have been absent many a year!
39815,HUBERT.,
39816,WALTER.,WALTER.
39817,WALTER.,How is the Prince?
39818,WALTER.,
39819,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39820,HUBERT.,He is not here;
39821,HUBERT.,He has been ill: and now has fled.
39822,HUBERT.,
39823,WALTER.,WALTER.
39824,WALTER.,Speak it out frankly: say he's dead!
39825,WALTER.,Is it not so?
39826,WALTER.,
39827,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39828,HUBERT.,"No; if you please,"
39829,HUBERT.,"A strange, mysterious disease"
39830,HUBERT.,Fell on him with a sudden blight.
39831,HUBERT.,Whole hours together he would stand
39832,HUBERT.,"Upon the terrace in a dream,"
39833,HUBERT.,"Resting his head upon his hand,"
39834,HUBERT.,"Best pleased when he was most alone,"
39835,HUBERT.,"Like Saint John Nepomuck in stone,"
39836,HUBERT.,Looking down into a stream.
39837,HUBERT.,"In the Round Tower, night after night,"
39838,HUBERT.,He sat and bleared his eyes with books;
39839,HUBERT.,Until one morning we found him there
39840,HUBERT.,"Stretched on the floor, as if in a swoon"
39841,HUBERT.,He had fallen from his chair.
39842,HUBERT.,We hardly recognized his sweet looks!
39843,HUBERT.,
39844,WALTER.,WALTER.
39845,WALTER.,Poor Prince!
39846,WALTER.,
39847,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39848,HUBERT.,I think he might have mended;
39849,HUBERT.,And he did mend; but very soon
39850,HUBERT.,"The priests came flocking in, like rooks,"
39851,HUBERT.,"With all their crosiers and their crooks,"
39852,HUBERT.,And so at last the matter ended.
39853,HUBERT.,
39854,WALTER.,WALTER.
39855,WALTER.,How did it end?
39856,WALTER.,
39857,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39858,HUBERT.,"Why, in Saint Rochus"
39859,HUBERT.,They made him stand and wait his doom;
39860,HUBERT.,"And, as if he were condemned to the tomb,"
39861,HUBERT.,Began to mutter their hocus-pocus.
39862,HUBERT.,"First, the Mass for the Dead they chanted,"
39863,HUBERT.,Then three times laid upon his head
39864,HUBERT.,"A shovelful of churchyard clay,"
39865,HUBERT.,"Saying to him, as he stood undaunted,"
39866,HUBERT.,"""This is a sign that thou art dead,"
39867,HUBERT.,"So in thy heart be penitent!"""
39868,HUBERT.,And forth from the chapel door he   went
39869,HUBERT.,"Into disgrace and banishment,"
39870,HUBERT.,"Clothed in a cloak of hodden gray,"
39871,HUBERT.,"And hearing a wallet, and a bell,"
39872,HUBERT.,Whose sound should be a perpetual knell
39873,HUBERT.,To keep all travellers away.
39874,HUBERT.,
39875,WALTER.,WALTER.
39876,WALTER.,"Oh, horrible fate!  Outcast, rejected,"
39877,WALTER.,As one with pestilence infected!
39878,WALTER.,
39879,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39880,HUBERT.,"Then was the family tomb unsealed,"
39881,HUBERT.,"And broken helmet, sword, and shield"
39882,HUBERT.,"Buried together, in common wreck,"
39883,HUBERT.,As is the custom when the last
39884,HUBERT.,"Of any princely house has passed,"
39885,HUBERT.,"And thrice, as with a trumpet-blast,"
39886,HUBERT.,A herald shouted down the stair
39887,HUBERT.,"The words of warning and despair,--"
39888,HUBERT.,"""O Hoheneck!  O Hoheneck!"""
39889,HUBERT.,
39890,WALTER.,WALTER.
39891,WALTER.,"Still in my soul that cry goes on,--"
39892,WALTER.,Forever gone! forever gone!
39893,WALTER.,"Ah, what a cruel sense of loss,"
39894,WALTER.,"Like a black shadow, would fall across"
39895,WALTER.,"The hearts of all, if he should die!"
39896,WALTER.,His gracious presence upon earth
39897,WALTER.,Was as a fire upon a hearth;
39898,WALTER.,"As pleasant songs, at morning sung,"
39899,WALTER.,The words that dropped from his sweet tongue
39900,WALTER.,Strengthened our hearts; or heard at night
39901,WALTER.,Made all our slumbers soft and light.
39902,WALTER.,Where is he?
39903,WALTER.,
39904,HUBERT.,HUBERT.
39905,HUBERT.,In the Odenwald.
39906,HUBERT.,"Some of his tenants, unappalled"
39907,HUBERT.,"By fear of death, or priestly word,--"
39908,HUBERT.,"A holy family, that make"
39909,HUBERT.,"Each meal a Supper of the Lord,--"
39910,HUBERT.,"Have him beneath their watch and ward,"
39911,HUBERT.,"For love of him, and Jesus' sake!"
39912,HUBERT.,Pray you come in.  For why should I
39913,HUBERT.,With out-door hospitality
39914,HUBERT.,My prince's friend thus entertain?
39915,HUBERT.,
39916,WALTER.,WALTER.
39917,WALTER.,I would a moment here remain.
39918,WALTER.,"But you, good Hubert, go before,"
39919,WALTER.,"Fill me a goblet of May-drink,"
39920,WALTER.,As aromatic as the May
39921,WALTER.,"From which it steals the breath away,"
39922,WALTER.,And which he loved so well of yore;
39923,WALTER.,It is of him that I would think.
39924,WALTER.,"You shall attend me, when I call,"
39925,WALTER.,In the ancestral banquet-hall.
39926,WALTER.,"Unseen companions, guests of air,"
39927,WALTER.,"You cannot wait on, will be there;"
39928,WALTER.,"They taste not food, they drink not wine,"
39929,WALTER.,"But their soft eyes look into mine,"
39930,WALTER.,"And their lips speak to me, and all"
39931,WALTER.,The vast and shadowy banquet-hall
39932,WALTER.,Is full of looks and words divine!
39933,WALTER.,
39934,WALTER.,Leaning over the parapet.
39935,WALTER.,
39936,WALTER.,The day is done; and slowly from the scene
39937,WALTER.,"The stooping sun up-gathers his spent shafts,"
39938,WALTER.,And puts them back into his golden quiver!
39939,WALTER.,"Below me in the valley, deep and green"
39940,WALTER.,"As goblets are, from which in thirsty draughts"
39941,WALTER.,"We drink its wine, the swift and mantling river"
39942,WALTER.,"Flows on triumphant through these lovely regions,"
39943,WALTER.,"Etched with the shadows of its sombre margent,"
39944,WALTER.,"And soft, reflected clouds of gold and argent!"
39945,WALTER.,"Yes, there it flows, forever, broad and still"
39946,WALTER.,As when the vanguard of the Roman legions
39947,WALTER.,First saw it from the top of yonder hill!
39948,WALTER.,"How beautiful it is!  Fresh fields of wheat,"
39949,WALTER.,"Vineyard and town, and tower with fluttering flag,"
39950,WALTER.,"The consecrated chapel on the crag,"
39951,WALTER.,"And the white hamlet gathered round its base,"
39952,WALTER.,"Like Mary sitting at her Saviour's feet,"
39953,WALTER.,And looking up at his beloved face!
39954,WALTER.,O friend!  O best of friends!  Thy absence more
39955,WALTER.,Than the impending night darkens the landscape o'er!

39994,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And with his eyes downcast
39995,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,In humility he said:
39996,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""I believe, O Lord,"
39997,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"What is written in thy Word,"
39998,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"But alas! I do not understand!"""
39999,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40000,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And lo! he heard
40001,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The sudden singing of a bird,"
40002,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A snow-white bird, that from a cloud"
40003,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Dropped down,"
40004,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And among the branches brown
40005,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Sat singing,"
40006,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"So sweet, and clear, and loud,"
40007,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,It seemed a thousand harp-strings ringing.
40008,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And the Monk Felix closed his book,"
40009,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And long, long,"
40010,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"With rapturous look,"
40011,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"He listened to the song,"
40012,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And hardly breathed or stirred,"
40013,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Until he saw, as in a vision,"
40014,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The land Elysian,"
40015,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And in the heavenly city heard
40016,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Angelic feet
40017,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Fall on the golden flagging of the street
40018,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And he would fain
40019,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Have caught the wondrous bird,"
40020,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But strove in vain;
40021,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"For it flew away, away,"
40022,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Far over hill and dell,"
40023,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And instead of its sweet singing
40024,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He heard the convent bell
40025,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Suddenly in the silence ringing
40026,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For the service of noonday.
40027,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And he retraced
40028,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,His pathway sadly and in haste.
40029,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40030,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,In the convent there was a change!
40031,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"He looked for each well-known face,"
40032,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But the faces were new and strange;
40033,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"New figures sat in the oaken stalls,"
40034,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,New voices chanted in the choir;
40035,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Yet the place was the same place,"
40036,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The same dusky walls
40037,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of cold, gray stone,"
40038,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The same cloisters and belfry and spire.
40039,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40040,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,A stranger and alone
40041,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Among that brotherhood
40042,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The Monk Felix stood.
40043,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""Forty years,"" said a Friar,"
40044,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""Have I been Prior"
40045,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of this convent in the wood,"
40046,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,But for that space
40047,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Never have I beheld thy face!"""
40048,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40049,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The heart of the Monk Felix fell
40050,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And he answered, with submissive tone,"
40051,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"This morning after the hour of Prime,"
40052,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"I left my cell,"
40053,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And wandered forth alone,"
40054,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Listening all the time
40055,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,To the melodious singing
40056,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of a beautiful white bird,"
40057,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Until I heard
40058,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The bells of the convent ringing
40059,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Noon from their noisy towers.
40060,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,It was as if I dreamed;
40061,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For what to me had seemed
40062,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Moments only, had been hours!"""
40063,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40064,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""Years!"" said a voice close by."
40065,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"It was an aged monk who spoke,"
40066,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,From a bench of oak
40067,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Fastened against the wall;--
40068,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He was the oldest monk of all.
40069,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,For a whole century
40070,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Had he been there,"
40071,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Serving God in prayer,"
40072,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The meekest and humblest of his creatures.
40073,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He remembered well the features
40074,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of Felix, and he said,"
40075,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Speaking distinct and slow:
40076,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"""One hundred years ago,"
40077,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"When I was a novice in this place,"
40078,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"There was here a monk, full of God's grace,"
40079,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Who bore the name
40080,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of Felix, and this man must be the same."""
40081,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40082,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And straightway
40083,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,They brought forth to the light of day
40084,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A volume old and brown,"
40085,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A huge tome, bound"
40086,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"In brass and wild-boar's hide,"
40087,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Wherein were written down
40088,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,The names of all who had died
40089,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"In the convent, since it was edified."
40090,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And there they found,"
40091,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Just as the old monk said,"
40092,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"That on a certain day and date,"
40093,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"One hundred years before,"
40094,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Had gone forth from the convent gate
40095,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"The Monk Felix, and never more"
40096,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,Had entered that sacred door.
40097,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,He had been counted among the dead!
40098,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"And they knew, at last,"
40099,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"That, such had been the power"
40100,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"Of that celestial and immortal song,"
40101,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,"A hundred years had passed,"
40102,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,And had not seemed so long
40103,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,As a single hour!
40104,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,
40105,A FARM IN THE ODENWALD,ELSIE comes in with flowers.

40107,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40108,ELSIE.,"Here are flowers for you,"

40113,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
40114,PRINCE HENRY.,"As thou standest there,"
40115,PRINCE HENRY.,Thou seemest to me like the angel

40117,PRINCE HENRY.,To Saint Cecilia's bridal chamber.
40118,PRINCE HENRY.,
40119,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40120,ELSIE.,But these will fade.
40121,ELSIE.,
40122,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
40123,PRINCE HENRY.,"Themselves will fade,"
40124,PRINCE HENRY.,"But not their memory,"
40125,PRINCE HENRY.,And memory has the power
40126,PRINCE HENRY.,To re-create them from the dust.
40127,PRINCE HENRY.,"They remind me, too,"
40128,PRINCE HENRY.,"Of martyred Dorothea,"
40129,PRINCE HENRY.,Who from Celestial gardens sent
40130,PRINCE HENRY.,Flowers as her witnesses

40133,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40134,ELSIE.,Do you know the story

40139,PRINCE HENRY.,Then tell it to me.
40140,PRINCE HENRY.,But first come hither.
40141,PRINCE HENRY.,"Lay the flowers down beside me,"

40145,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40146,ELSIE.,Early in the morning
40147,ELSIE.,The Sultan's daughter
40148,ELSIE.,"Walked in her father's garden,"

40151,ELSIE.,
40152,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.

40154,PRINCE HENRY.,"This morning, dearest Elsie."
40155,PRINCE HENRY.,
40156,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40157,ELSIE.,And as she gathered them
40158,ELSIE.,She wondered more and more
40159,ELSIE.,"Who was the Master of the Flowers,"
40160,ELSIE.,And made them grow
40161,ELSIE.,"Out of the cold, dark earth."
40162,ELSIE.,"""In my heart,"" she said,"
40163,ELSIE.,"""I love him; and for him"

40166,ELSIE.,
40167,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
40168,PRINCE HENRY.,"Dear, innocent child!"
40169,PRINCE HENRY.,How sweetly thou recallest
40170,PRINCE HENRY.,The long-forgotten legend.
40171,PRINCE HENRY.,That in my early childhood
40172,PRINCE HENRY.,My mother told me!
40173,PRINCE HENRY.,Upon my brain
40174,PRINCE HENRY.,"It reappears once more,"
40175,PRINCE HENRY.,As a birth-mark on the forehead
40176,PRINCE HENRY.,When a hand suddenly
40177,PRINCE HENRY.,"Is raised upon it, and removed!"
40178,PRINCE HENRY.,
40179,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40180,ELSIE.,"And at midnight,"
40181,ELSIE.,"As she lay upon her bed,"
40182,ELSIE.,She heard a voice
40183,ELSIE.,"Call to her from the garden,"
40184,ELSIE.,"And, looking forth from her window,"
40185,ELSIE.,She saw a beautiful youth
40186,ELSIE.,Standing among the flowers.
40187,ELSIE.,It was the Lord Jesus;
40188,ELSIE.,"And she went down to Him,"
40189,ELSIE.,And opened the door for Him;
40190,ELSIE.,"And He said to her, ""O maiden!"
40191,ELSIE.,"Thou hast thought of me with love,"
40192,ELSIE.,And for thy sake
40193,ELSIE.,Out of my Father's kingdom
40194,ELSIE.,Have I come hither:
40195,ELSIE.,I am the Master of the Flowers.
40196,ELSIE.,"My garden is in Paradise,"
40197,ELSIE.,"And if thou wilt go with me,"
40198,ELSIE.,Thy bridal garland
40199,ELSIE.,"Shall be of bright red flowers."""
40200,ELSIE.,And then He took from his finger
40201,ELSIE.,"A golden ring,"
40202,ELSIE.,And asked the Sultan's daughter
40203,ELSIE.,If she would be his bride.
40204,ELSIE.,"And when she answered Him with love,"
40205,ELSIE.,"His wounds began to bleed,"
40206,ELSIE.,"And she said to Him,"
40207,ELSIE.,"""O Love! how red thy heart is,"
40208,ELSIE.,"And thy hands are full of roses."""
40209,ELSIE.,"""For thy sake,"" answered He,"
40210,ELSIE.,"""For thy sake is my heart so red,"
40211,ELSIE.,For thee I bring these roses;
40212,ELSIE.,I gathered them at the cross
40213,ELSIE.,Whereon I died for thee!
40214,ELSIE.,"I Come, for my Father calls."
40215,ELSIE.,"Thou art my elected bride!"""
40216,ELSIE.,And the Sultan's daughter
40217,ELSIE.,Followed Him to his Father's garden.
40218,ELSIE.,
40219,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
40220,PRINCE HENRY.,"Wouldst thou have done so, Elsie?"
40221,PRINCE HENRY.,
40222,ELSIE.,ELSIE.
40223,ELSIE.,"Yes, very gladly."
40224,ELSIE.,
40225,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
40226,PRINCE HENRY.,Then the Celestial Bridegroom
40227,PRINCE HENRY.,Will come for thee also.
40228,PRINCE HENRY.,"Upon thy forehead He will place,"
40229,PRINCE HENRY.,"Not his crown of thorns,"
40230,PRINCE HENRY.,But a crown of roses.
40231,PRINCE HENRY.,"In thy bridal chamber,"
40232,PRINCE HENRY.,"Like Saint Cecilia,"
40233,PRINCE HENRY.,"Thou shalt hear sweet music,"
40234,PRINCE HENRY.,And breathe the fragrance
40235,PRINCE HENRY.,Of flowers immortal!
40236,PRINCE HENRY.,Go now and place these flowers
40237,PRINCE HENRY.,Before her picture.

40836,A VILLAGE CHURCH,At his own particular desire.
40837,A VILLAGE CHURCH,
40838,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"And here, in a corner of the wall,"
40839,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Shadowy, silent, apart from all,"
40840,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"With its awful portal open wide,"
40841,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"And its latticed windows on either side,"
40842,A VILLAGE CHURCH,And its step well worn by the beaded knees
40843,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Of one or two pious centuries,"
40844,A VILLAGE CHURCH,Stands the village confessional!
40845,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Within it, as an honored guest,"

40849,A VILLAGE CHURCH,
40850,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Here sits the priest; and faint and low,"

40853,A VILLAGE CHURCH,The ceaseless sound of human woe;
40854,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Here, while her bosom aches and throbs"
40855,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"With deep and agonizing sobs,"
40856,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"That half are passion, half contrition,"
40857,A VILLAGE CHURCH,The luckless daughter of perdition
40858,A VILLAGE CHURCH,Slowly confesses her secret shame!
40859,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"The time, the place, the lover's name!"
40860,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Here the grim murderer, with a groan,"
40861,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"From his bruised conscience rolls the stone,"
40862,A VILLAGE CHURCH,Thinking that thus he can atone
40863,A VILLAGE CHURCH,For ravages of sword and flame!
40864,A VILLAGE CHURCH,
40865,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Indeed, I marvel, and marvel greatly,"
40866,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"How a priest can sit here so sedately,"
40867,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Reading, the whole year out and in,"
40868,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Naught but the catalogue of sin,"
40869,A VILLAGE CHURCH,And still keep any faith whatever

40875,A VILLAGE CHURCH,The graveyard in the human heart
40876,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Gives up its dead, at the voice of the priest,"
40877,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"As if he were an archangel, at least."
40878,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"It makes a peculiar atmosphere,"
40879,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"This odor of earthly passions and crimes,"
40880,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"Such as I like to breathe, at times,"
40881,A VILLAGE CHURCH,And such as often brings me here
40882,A VILLAGE CHURCH,In the hottest and most pestilential season.
40883,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"To-day, I come for another reason;"
40884,A VILLAGE CHURCH,To foster and ripen an evil thought
40885,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"In a heart that is almost to madness wrought,"
40886,A VILLAGE CHURCH,"And to make a murderer out of a prince,"
40887,A VILLAGE CHURCH,A sleight of hand I learned long since!
40888,A VILLAGE CHURCH,He comes.  In the twilight he will not see
40889,A VILLAGE CHURCH,The difference between his priest and me!

40914,PRINCE HENRY.,"As in a cloudy atmosphere,"

40916,PRINCE HENRY.,A sudden and impetuous wind

40947,PRINCE HENRY.,"With frantic gestures and wild cries,"
40948,PRINCE HENRY.,"It hurries onward, and aloud"
40949,PRINCE HENRY.,Repeats its awful prophecies!
40950,PRINCE HENRY.,Weakness is wretchedness!  To be strong

40960,LUCIFER.,Though in the Decalogue we find
40961,LUCIFER.,"The mandate written, ""Thou shalt not kill!"""
40962,LUCIFER.,Yet there are cases when we must.
40963,LUCIFER.,"In war, for instance, or from scathe"
40964,LUCIFER.,To guard and keep the one true faith

40967,LUCIFER.,"For a mild and general application,"
40968,LUCIFER.,To be understood with the reservation
40969,LUCIFER.,That in certain instances the Right
40970,LUCIFER.,Must yield to the Expedient!
40971,LUCIFER.,Thou art a Prince.  If thou shouldst die
40972,LUCIFER.,What hearts and hopes would prostrate lie!
40973,LUCIFER.,"What noble deeds, what fair renown,"
40974,LUCIFER.,Into the grave with thee go down!
40975,LUCIFER.,What acts of valor and courtesy

40978,LUCIFER.,"With thee a noble name expires,"

40980,LUCIFER.,The glorious memory of thy sires!
40981,LUCIFER.,She is a peasant.  In her veins
40982,LUCIFER.,Flows common and plebeian blood;
40983,LUCIFER.,It is such as daily and hourly stains
40984,LUCIFER.,"The dust and the turf of battle plains,"
40985,LUCIFER.,"By vassals shed, in a crimson flood,"
40986,LUCIFER.,"Without reserve and without reward,"
40987,LUCIFER.,At the slightest summons of their lord!
40988,LUCIFER.,But thine is precious; the fore-appointed
40989,LUCIFER.,"Blood of kings, of God's anointed!"
40990,LUCIFER.,"Moreover, what has the world in store"
40991,LUCIFER.,"For one like her, but tears and toil?"
40992,LUCIFER.,"Daughter of sorrow, serf of the soil,"
40993,LUCIFER.,"A peasant's child and a peasant's wife,"
40994,LUCIFER.,And her soul within her sick and sore
40995,LUCIFER.,With the roughness and barrenness of life!
40996,LUCIFER.,I marvel not at the heart's recoil
40997,LUCIFER.,"From a fate like this, in one so tender,"
40998,LUCIFER.,Nor at its eagerness to surrender
40999,LUCIFER.,"All the wretchedness, want, and woe"
41000,LUCIFER.,"That await it in this world below,"
41001,LUCIFER.,For the unutterable splendor

41003,LUCIFER.,So the Church sanctions the sacrifice:

41007,LUCIFER.,"She offers, as a gift divine;"

41013,PRINCE HENRY.,And will the righteous Heaven forgive?
41014,PRINCE HENRY.,"No action, whether foal or fair,"
41015,PRINCE HENRY.,"Is ever done, but it leaves somewhere"
41016,PRINCE HENRY.,"A record, written by fingers ghostly,"
41017,PRINCE HENRY.,"As a blessing or a curse, and mostly"
41018,PRINCE HENRY.,In the greater weakness or greater strength
41019,PRINCE HENRY.,"Of the acts which follow it, till at length"
41020,PRINCE HENRY.,"The wrongs of ages are redressed,"

41022,PRINCE HENRY.,
41023,LUCIFER.,LUCIFER.
41024,LUCIFER.,In ancient records it is stated
41025,LUCIFER.,"That, whenever an evil deed is done,"
41026,LUCIFER.,Another devil is created
41027,LUCIFER.,To scourge and torment the offending one!
41028,LUCIFER.,"But evil is only good perverted,"
41029,LUCIFER.,"And Lucifer, the bearer of Light,"
41030,LUCIFER.,"But an angel fallen and deserted,"

41552,PRINCE HENRY.,For the bells themselves are the best of preachers;

41563,PRINCE HENRY.,"Representeth the Holy Rood,"
41564,PRINCE HENRY.,"Upon which, like the bell, our hopes are hung."
41565,PRINCE HENRY.,And the wheel wherewith it is swayed and rung
41566,PRINCE HENRY.,"Is the mind of man, that round and round"
41567,PRINCE HENRY.,"Sways, and maketh the tongue to sound!"

41571,PRINCE HENRY.,And the upward and downward motion show
41572,PRINCE HENRY.,That we touch upon matters high and low;

42527,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Of the innocent boy, who, some years back,"
42528,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Was taken and crucified by the Jews,"
42529,FRIAR CLAUS.,In that ancient town of Bacharach!

42532,FRIAR CLAUS.,"The beautiful town, that gives us wine"
42533,FRIAR CLAUS.,With the fragrant odor of Muscadine!
42534,FRIAR CLAUS.,I should deem it wrong to let this pass
42535,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Without first touching my lips to the glass,"
42536,FRIAR CLAUS.,For here in the midst of the current I stand
42537,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Like the stone Pfalz in the midst of the river,"
42538,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Taking toll upon either hand,"
42539,FRIAR CLAUS.,And much more grateful to the giver.

42546,FRIAR CLAUS.,The rascal who drank wine out of a boot.
42547,FRIAR CLAUS.,"And, after all, it was not a crime,"
42548,FRIAR CLAUS.,For he won thereby Dorf Huffelsheim.
42549,FRIAR CLAUS.,A jolly old toper! who at a pull
42550,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Could drink a postilion's jack-boot full,"
42551,FRIAR CLAUS.,"And ask with a laugh, when that was done,"
42552,FRIAR CLAUS.,If the fellow had left the other one!
42553,FRIAR CLAUS.,This wine is as good as we can afford
42554,FRIAR CLAUS.,"To the friars who sit at the lower board,"
42555,FRIAR CLAUS.,"And cannot distinguish bad from good,"
42556,FRIAR CLAUS.,"And are far better off than if they could,"
42557,FRIAR CLAUS.,"Being rather the rude disciples of beer,"

42571,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Ere I that awful name record,"

42574,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,Pure from blemish and blot must it be

42580,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Of this same gentle Evangelist,"
42581,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"That Christ himself perhaps has kissed,"

42583,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"It has a very awful look,"

42585,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,Like the sun in an eclipse.
42586,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Ah me! when I think of that vision divine,"
42587,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Think of writing it, line by line,"
42588,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"I stand in awe of the terrible curse,"

42591,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Take aught from the book of that Prophecy,"

42596,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"In open day, on the selfsame shelf"
42597,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"With the writings of St. Thecla herself,"

42612,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"All ablaze with crimson and gold,"

42614,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,A certain satisfaction steal
42615,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Into my heart, and into my brain,"
42616,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,As if my talent had not lain
42617,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Wrapped in a napkin, and all in vain."
42618,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Yes, I might almost say to the Lord,"
42619,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Here is a copy of thy Word,"

42633,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,For the margin of my Gospel book.
42634,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,
42635,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,He makes a sketch.
42636,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,
42637,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,I can see no more.  Through the valley yonder
42638,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,A shower is passing; I hear the thunder
42639,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"Mutter its curses in the air,"
42640,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,The devil's own and only prayer!
42641,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"The dusty road is brown with rain,"

42643,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,Hitherward rides a gallant train.
42644,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"They do not parley, they cannot wait,"
42645,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,But hurry in at the convent gate.
42646,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,What a fair lady! and beside her
42647,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"What a handsome, graceful, noble rider!"
42648,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,Now she gives him her hand to alight;
42649,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,They will beg a shelter for the night.
42650,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,"I will go down to the corridor,"
42651,FRIAR PACIFICUS.,And try to see that face once more;

43348,IRMINGARD.,"The fragrance of the flowers, were there;"
43349,IRMINGARD.,"And I grew restless as I heard,"
43350,IRMINGARD.,"Restless and buoyant as a bird,"
43351,IRMINGARD.,"Down soft, aerial currents sailing,"
43352,IRMINGARD.,"O'er blossomed orchards and fields in bloom,"
43353,IRMINGARD.,"And through the momentary gloom,"
43354,IRMINGARD.,"Of shadows o'er the landscape trailing,"
43355,IRMINGARD.,"Yielding and borne I knew not where,"
43356,IRMINGARD.,But feeling resistance unavailing.
43357,IRMINGARD.,
43358,IRMINGARD.,"And thus, unnoticed and apart,"
43359,IRMINGARD.,"And more by accident than choice,"
43360,IRMINGARD.,I listened to that single voice
43361,IRMINGARD.,Until the chambers of my heart
43362,IRMINGARD.,Were filled with it by night and day.
43363,IRMINGARD.,"One night,--it was a night in May,--"
43364,IRMINGARD.,"Within the garden, unawares,"
43365,IRMINGARD.,"Under the blossoms in the gloom,"
43366,IRMINGARD.,I heard it utter my own name
43367,IRMINGARD.,With protestations and wild prayers;
43368,IRMINGARD.,"And it rang through me, and became"
43369,IRMINGARD.,"Like the archangel's trump of doom,"
43370,IRMINGARD.,"Which the soul hears, and must obey;"
43371,IRMINGARD.,And mine arose as from a tomb.
43372,IRMINGARD.,My former life now seemed to me
43373,IRMINGARD.,"Such as hereafter death may be,"
43374,IRMINGARD.,When in the great Eternity
43375,IRMINGARD.,We shall awake and find it day.
43376,IRMINGARD.,
43377,IRMINGARD.,"It was a dream, and would not stay;"
43378,IRMINGARD.,"A dream, that in a single night"
43379,IRMINGARD.,Faded and vanished out of sight.
43380,IRMINGARD.,My father's anger followed fast
43381,IRMINGARD.,"This passion, as a freshening blast"
43382,IRMINGARD.,"Seeks out and fans the fire, whose rage"
43383,IRMINGARD.,"It may increase, but not assuage."
43384,IRMINGARD.,"And he exclaimed: ""No wandering bard"
43385,IRMINGARD.,"Shall win thy hand, O Irmingard!"
43386,IRMINGARD.,For which Prince Henry of Hoheneck
43387,IRMINGARD.,"By messenger and letter sues."""
43388,IRMINGARD.,
43389,IRMINGARD.,"Gently, but firmly, I replied:"
43390,IRMINGARD.,"""Henry of Hoheneck I discard!"
43391,IRMINGARD.,Never the hand of Irmingard
43392,IRMINGARD.,Shall lie in his as the hand of a bride!
43393,IRMINGARD.,"This said I, Walter, for thy sake"
43394,IRMINGARD.,"This said I, for I could not choose."
43395,IRMINGARD.,"After a pause, my father spake"
43396,IRMINGARD.,In that cold and deliberate tone
43397,IRMINGARD.,"Which turns the hearer into stone,"
43398,IRMINGARD.,And seems itself the act to be
43399,IRMINGARD.,That follows with such dread certainty
43400,IRMINGARD.,"""This or the cloister and the veil!"""
43401,IRMINGARD.,"No other words than these he said,"
43402,IRMINGARD.,But they were like a funeral wail;
43403,IRMINGARD.,"My life was ended, my heart was dead."
43404,IRMINGARD.,
43405,IRMINGARD.,That night from the castle-gate went down
43406,IRMINGARD.,"With silent, slow, and stealthy pace,"
43407,IRMINGARD.,"Two shadows, mounted on shadowy steeds,"
43408,IRMINGARD.,Taking the narrow path that leads
43409,IRMINGARD.,Into the forest dense and brown.
43410,IRMINGARD.,"In the leafy darkness of the place,"
43411,IRMINGARD.,"One could not distinguish form nor face,"
43412,IRMINGARD.,"Only a bulk without a shape,"
43413,IRMINGARD.,A darker shadow in the shade;
43414,IRMINGARD.,One scarce could say it moved or stayed.
43415,IRMINGARD.,Thus it was we made our escape!
43416,IRMINGARD.,"A foaming brook, with many a bound,"
43417,IRMINGARD.,Followed us like a playful hound;
43418,IRMINGARD.,"Then leaped before us, and in the hollow"
43419,IRMINGARD.,"Paused, and waited for us to follow,"
43420,IRMINGARD.,"And seemed impatient, and afraid"
43421,IRMINGARD.,That our tardy flight should be betrayed
43422,IRMINGARD.,By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made.
43423,IRMINGARD.,"And when we reached the plain below,"
43424,IRMINGARD.,We paused a moment and drew rein
43425,IRMINGARD.,To look back at the castle again;
43426,IRMINGARD.,And we saw the windows all aglow
43427,IRMINGARD.,"With lights, that were passing to and fro;"
43428,IRMINGARD.,Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;
43429,IRMINGARD.,The brook crept silent to our feet;
43430,IRMINGARD.,We knew what most we feared to know.
43431,IRMINGARD.,Then suddenly horns began to blow;
43432,IRMINGARD.,"And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,"
43433,IRMINGARD.,And our horses snorted in the damp
43434,IRMINGARD.,"Night-air of the meadows green and wide,"
43435,IRMINGARD.,"And in a moment, side by side,"
43436,IRMINGARD.,"So close, they must have seemed but one,"
43437,IRMINGARD.,"The shadows across the moonlight run,"
43438,IRMINGARD.,"And another came, and swept behind,"
43439,IRMINGARD.,Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!
43440,IRMINGARD.,
43441,IRMINGARD.,How I remember that breathless flight
43442,IRMINGARD.,"Across the moors, in the summer night!"
43443,IRMINGARD.,"How under our feet the long, white road"
43444,IRMINGARD.,"Backward like a river flowed,"
43445,IRMINGARD.,"Sweeping with it fences and hedges,"
43446,IRMINGARD.,"Whilst farther away and overhead,"
43447,IRMINGARD.,"Paler than I, with fear and dread,"
43448,IRMINGARD.,The moon fled with us as we fled
43449,IRMINGARD.,Along the forest's jagged edges!
43450,IRMINGARD.,
43451,IRMINGARD.,All this I can remember well;
43452,IRMINGARD.,But of what afterwards befell
43453,IRMINGARD.,I nothing further can recall
43454,IRMINGARD.,"Than a blind, desperate, headlong fall;"
43455,IRMINGARD.,The rest is a blank and darkness all.
43456,IRMINGARD.,"When I awoke out of this swoon,"
43457,IRMINGARD.,"The sun was shining, not the moon,"
43458,IRMINGARD.,Making a cross upon the wall
43459,IRMINGARD.,With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;
43460,IRMINGARD.,"And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray"
43461,IRMINGARD.,"From early childhood, day by day,"
43462,IRMINGARD.,"Each morning, as in bed I lay!"
43463,IRMINGARD.,I was lying again in my own room!
43464,IRMINGARD.,"And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,"
43465,IRMINGARD.,That those shadows on the midnight plain
43466,IRMINGARD.,"Were gone, and could not come again!"
43467,IRMINGARD.,I struggled no longer with my doom!
43468,IRMINGARD.,
43469,IRMINGARD.,This happened many years ago.
43470,IRMINGARD.,I left my father's home to come
43471,IRMINGARD.,"Like Catherine to her martyrdom,"
43472,IRMINGARD.,For blindly I esteemed it so.
43473,IRMINGARD.,And when I heard the convent door
43474,IRMINGARD.,"Behind me close, to ope no more,"
43475,IRMINGARD.,I felt it smite me like a blow.
43476,IRMINGARD.,"Through all my limbs a shudder ran,"
43477,IRMINGARD.,And on my bruised spirit fell
43478,IRMINGARD.,The dampness of my narrow cell
43479,IRMINGARD.,"As night-air on a wounded man,"
43480,IRMINGARD.,Giving intolerable pain.
43481,IRMINGARD.,
43482,IRMINGARD.,But now a better life began.
43483,IRMINGARD.,I felt the agony decrease
43484,IRMINGARD.,"By slow degrees, then wholly cease,"
43485,IRMINGARD.,Ending in perfect rest and peace!
43486,IRMINGARD.,"It was not apathy, nor dulness,"
43487,IRMINGARD.,"That weighed and pressed upon my brain,"
43488,IRMINGARD.,But the same passion I had given
43489,IRMINGARD.,"To earth before, now turned to heaven"
43490,IRMINGARD.,With all its overflowing fulness.
43491,IRMINGARD.,
43492,IRMINGARD.,Alas! the world is full of peril!
43493,IRMINGARD.,"The path that runs through the fairest meads,"
43494,IRMINGARD.,"On the sunniest side of the valley, leads"
43495,IRMINGARD.,Into a region bleak and sterile!
43496,IRMINGARD.,"Alike in the high-born and the lowly,"
43497,IRMINGARD.,"The will is feeble, and passion strong."
43498,IRMINGARD.,We cannot sever right from wrong;
43499,IRMINGARD.,Some falsehood mingles with all truth;
43500,IRMINGARD.,Nor is it strange the heart of youth
43501,IRMINGARD.,Should waver and comprehend but slowly
43502,IRMINGARD.,The things that are holy and unholy!
43503,IRMINGARD.,"But in this sacred, calm retreat,"
43504,IRMINGARD.,We are all well and safely shielded
43505,IRMINGARD.,"From winds that blow, and waves that beat,"
43506,IRMINGARD.,"From the cold, and rain, and blighting heat,"
43507,IRMINGARD.,To which the strongest hearts have yielded.
43508,IRMINGARD.,"Here we stand as the Virgins Seven,"
43509,IRMINGARD.,For our celestial bridegroom yearning;
43510,IRMINGARD.,"Our hearts are lamps forever burning,"
43511,IRMINGARD.,"With a steady and unwavering flame,"
43512,IRMINGARD.,"Pointing upward, forever the same,"
43513,IRMINGARD.,Steadily upward toward the heaven!
43514,IRMINGARD.,
43515,IRMINGARD.,The moon is hidden behind a cloud;
43516,IRMINGARD.,"A sudden darkness fills the room,"
43517,IRMINGARD.,"And thy deep eyes, amid the gloom,"
43518,IRMINGARD.,Shine like jewels in a shroud.
43519,IRMINGARD.,On the leaves is a sound of falling rain;
43520,IRMINGARD.,"A bird, awakened in its nest,"
43521,IRMINGARD.,"Gives a faint twitter of unrest,"
43522,IRMINGARD.,Then smooths its plumes and sleeps again.
43523,IRMINGARD.,No other sounds than these I hear;
43524,IRMINGARD.,The hour of midnight must be near.
43525,IRMINGARD.,Thou art o'erspent with the day's fatigue
43526,IRMINGARD.,Of riding many a dusty league;
43527,IRMINGARD.,"Sink, then, gently to thy slumber;"
43528,IRMINGARD.,"Me so many cares encumber,"
43529,IRMINGARD.,"So many ghosts, and forms of fright,"
43530,IRMINGARD.,"Have started from their graves to-night,"
43531,IRMINGARD.,They have driven sleep from mine eyes away:
43532,IRMINGARD.,I will go down to the chapel and pray.

44178,IL PADRONE.,Struck the sea with their cat's-paws.
44179,IL PADRONE.,Only a little hour ago
44180,IL PADRONE.,I was whistling to Saint Antonio
44181,IL PADRONE.,"For a capful of wind to fill our sail,"
44182,IL PADRONE.,And instead of a breeze he has sent a gale.
44183,IL PADRONE.,"Last night I saw St. Elmo's stars,"
44184,IL PADRONE.,"With their glimmering lanterns, all at play"
44185,IL PADRONE.,"On the tops of the masts and the tips of the spars,"

44194,IL PADRONE.,"I was looking when the wind o'ertook her,"
44195,IL PADRONE.,"She had all sail set, and the only wonder"
44196,IL PADRONE.,Is that at once the strength of the blast
44197,IL PADRONE.,Did not carry away her mast.
44198,IL PADRONE.,"She is a galley of the Gran Duca,"

44200,IL PADRONE.,"Convoys those lazy brigantines,"
44201,IL PADRONE.,Laden with wine and oil from Lucca.

44205,IL PADRONE.,"Ha! that is the first dash of the rain,"
44206,IL PADRONE.,"With a sprinkle of spray above the rails,"
44207,IL PADRONE.,"Just enough to moisten our sails,"
44208,IL PADRONE.,And make them ready for the strain.
44209,IL PADRONE.,"See how she leaps, as the blasts o'ertake her,"
44210,IL PADRONE.,And speeds away with a bone in her mouth!
44211,IL PADRONE.,"Now keep her head toward the south,"

44225,SCHOLASTIC.,"There, that is my gauntlet, my banner, my shield,"
44226,SCHOLASTIC.,Hung up as a challenge to all the field!
44227,SCHOLASTIC.,"One hundred and twenty-five propositions,"
44228,SCHOLASTIC.,Which I will maintain with the sword of the tongue
44229,SCHOLASTIC.,"Against all disputants, old and young."
44230,SCHOLASTIC.,Let us see if doctors or dialecticians
44231,SCHOLASTIC.,"Will dare to dispute my definitions,"
44232,SCHOLASTIC.,Or attack any one of my learned theses.
44233,SCHOLASTIC.,Here stand I; the end shall be as God pleases.
44234,SCHOLASTIC.,"I think I have proved, by profound researches,"
44235,SCHOLASTIC.,The error of all those doctrines so vicious
44236,SCHOLASTIC.,"Of the old Areopagite Dionysius,"
44237,SCHOLASTIC.,"That are making such terrible work in the churches,"
44238,SCHOLASTIC.,"By Michael the Stammerer sent from the East,"

44241,SCHOLASTIC.,"In the face of the truth, the error infernal,"
44242,SCHOLASTIC.,That the universe is and must be eternal;
44243,SCHOLASTIC.,"At first laying down, as a fact fundamental,"
44244,SCHOLASTIC.,That nothing with God can be accidental;
44245,SCHOLASTIC.,Then asserting that God before the creation
44246,SCHOLASTIC.,"Could not have existed, because it is plain"
44247,SCHOLASTIC.,"That, had He existed, He would have created;"
44248,SCHOLASTIC.,"Which is begging the question that should be debated,"
44249,SCHOLASTIC.,And moveth me less to anger than laughter.
44250,SCHOLASTIC.,"All nature, he holds, is a respiration"
44251,SCHOLASTIC.,"Of the Spirit of God, who, in breathing, hereafter"
44252,SCHOLASTIC.,"Will inhale it into his bosom again,"
44253,SCHOLASTIC.,So that nothing but God alone will remain.
44254,SCHOLASTIC.,And therein he contradicteth himself;
44255,SCHOLASTIC.,"For he opens the whole discussion by stating,"
44256,SCHOLASTIC.,That God can only exist in creating.
44257,SCHOLASTIC.,That question I think I have laid on the shelf!

44297,SECOND SCHOLAR.,"So much, at least, I am bound to acknowledge:"
44298,SECOND SCHOLAR.,"The air seems healthy, the buildings stately,"

44327,FIRST SCHOLAR.,FIRST SCHOLAR.
44328,FIRST SCHOLAR.,Oh yes
44329,FIRST SCHOLAR.,For none but a clever dialectician
44330,FIRST SCHOLAR.,Can hope to become a great physician;
44331,FIRST SCHOLAR.,That has been settled long ago.
44332,FIRST SCHOLAR.,Logic makes an important part

44350,FIRST SCHOLAR.,And a volume universally known
44351,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"As the Regimen of the School of Salern,"
44352,FIRST SCHOLAR.,For Robert of Normandy written in terse
44353,FIRST SCHOLAR.,And very elegant Latin verse.
44354,FIRST SCHOLAR.,Each of these writings has its turn.
44355,FIRST SCHOLAR.,And when at length we have finished these
44356,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"Then comes the struggle for degrees,"
44357,FIRST SCHOLAR.,Will all the oldest and ablest critics;

44362,FIRST SCHOLAR.,There the triumphant Magister stands!
44363,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"A book is solemnly placed in his hands,"
44364,FIRST SCHOLAR.,On which he swears to follow the rule

44366,FIRST SCHOLAR.,To report if any confectionarius
44367,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"Mingles his drugs with matters various,"

44371,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"Having faithfully promised these,"
44372,FIRST SCHOLAR.,His head is crowned with a laurel crown;
44373,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"A kiss on his cheek, a ring on his hand,"
44374,FIRST SCHOLAR.,The Magister Artium et Physices
44375,FIRST SCHOLAR.,Goes forth from the school like a lord of the land.
44376,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"And now, as we have the whole morning before us,"
44377,FIRST SCHOLAR.,"Let us go in, if you make no objection,"
44378,FIRST SCHOLAR.,And listen awhile to a learned prelection
44379,FIRST SCHOLAR.,On Marcus Aurelius Cassioderus.

44384,LUCIFER.,This is the great School of Salern!

44387,LUCIFER.,"Where every emulous scholar hears,"
44388,LUCIFER.,"In every breath that comes to his ears,"
44389,LUCIFER.,The rustling of another's laurels!
44390,LUCIFER.,The air of the place is called salubrious;
44391,LUCIFER.,The neighborhood of Vesuvius lends it
44392,LUCIFER.,"Au odor volcanic, that rather mends it,"
44393,LUCIFER.,"And the building's have an aspect lugubrious,"
44394,LUCIFER.,That inspires a feeling of awe and terror
44395,LUCIFER.,Into the heart of the beholder.
44396,LUCIFER.,"And befits such an ancient homestead of error,"
44397,LUCIFER.,"Where the old falsehoods moulder and smoulder,"
44398,LUCIFER.,And yearly by many hundred hands
44399,LUCIFER.,"Are carried away in the zeal of youth,"
44400,LUCIFER.,"And sown like tares in the field of truth,"
44401,LUCIFER.,To blossom and ripen in other lands.
44402,LUCIFER.,
44403,LUCIFER.,"What have we here, affixed to the gate?"
44404,LUCIFER.,"The challenge of some scholastic wight,"
44405,LUCIFER.,Who wishes to hold a public debate
44406,LUCIFER.,On sundry questions wrong or right!
44407,LUCIFER.,"Ah, now this is my great delight!"
44408,LUCIFER.,For I have often observed of late
44409,LUCIFER.,That such discussions end in a fight.
44410,LUCIFER.,Let us see what the learned wag maintains
44411,LUCIFER.,With such a prodigal waste of brains.
44412,LUCIFER.,
44413,LUCIFER.,Reads.
44414,LUCIFER.,
44415,LUCIFER.,"""Whether angels in moving from place to place"

44417,LUCIFER.,"Whether God himself is the author of evil,"
44418,LUCIFER.,Or whether that is the work of the Devil.
44419,LUCIFER.,"When, where, and wherefore Lucifer fell,"
44420,LUCIFER.,"And whether he now is chained in hell."""
44421,LUCIFER.,I think I can answer that question well!
44422,LUCIFER.,So long as the boastful human mind
44423,LUCIFER.,"Consents in such mills as this to grind,"
44424,LUCIFER.,I sit very firmly upon my throne!
44425,LUCIFER.,"Of a truth it almost makes me laugh,"
44426,LUCIFER.,To see men leaving the golden grain
44427,LUCIFER.,To gather in piles the pitiful chaff
44428,LUCIFER.,"That old Peter Lombard thrashed with his brain,"
44429,LUCIFER.,To have it caught up and tossed again
44430,LUCIFER.,On the horns of the Dumb Ox of Cologne!
44431,LUCIFER.,
44432,LUCIFER.,But my guests approach! there is in the air
44433,LUCIFER.,"A fragrance, like that of the Beautiful Garden"
44434,LUCIFER.,"Of Paradise, in the days that were!"
44435,LUCIFER.,"An odor of innocence and of prayer,"
44436,LUCIFER.,"And of love, and faith that never fails,"
44437,LUCIFER.,Such as the fresh young heart exhales
44438,LUCIFER.,Before it begins to wither and harden!
44439,LUCIFER.,I cannot breathe such an atmosphere!
44440,LUCIFER.,"My soul is filled with a nameless fear,"
44441,LUCIFER.,"That after all my trouble and pain,"
44442,LUCIFER.,"After all my restless endeavor,"
44443,LUCIFER.,"The youngest, fairest soul of the twain,"
44444,LUCIFER.,"The most ethereal, most divine,"
44445,LUCIFER.,Will escape from my hands for ever and ever.
44446,LUCIFER.,But the other is already mine!
44447,LUCIFER.,"Let him live to corrupt his race,"
44448,LUCIFER.,"Breathing among them, with every breath,"
44449,LUCIFER.,"Weakness, selfishness, and the base"
44450,LUCIFER.,And pusillanimous fear of death.
44451,LUCIFER.,"I know his nature, and I know"

44506,PRINCE HENRY.,PRINCE HENRY.
44507,PRINCE HENRY.,I forbid it!

44522,ELSIE.,The other keeps his dreadful day-book open
44523,ELSIE.,"Till sunset, that we may repent; which doing,"

44525,ELSIE.,And leaves a line of white across the page.
44526,ELSIE.,"Now if my act be good, as I believe,"

44616,URSULA.,Never one of a household only!
44617,URSULA.,"Perhaps it is a mercy of God,"

44725,FORESTER.,I did not tell you she was dead;

44749,FORESTER.,Some beautiful and foreign lady.
44750,FORESTER.,"And the Prince looked so grand and proud,"

45013,MARTIN LUTHER.,MARTIN LUTHER.
45014,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Our God, a Tower of Strength is He,"
45015,MARTIN LUTHER.,A goodly wall and weapon;
45016,MARTIN LUTHER.,"From all our need He helps us free,"
45017,MARTIN LUTHER.,That now to us doth happen.
45018,MARTIN LUTHER.,The old evil foe
45019,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Doth in earnest grow,"
45020,MARTIN LUTHER.,"In grim armor dight,"
45021,MARTIN LUTHER.,Much guile and great might;
45022,MARTIN LUTHER.,On earth there is none like him.
45023,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45024,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Oh yes; a tower of strength indeed,"
45025,MARTIN LUTHER.,"A present help in all our need,"
45026,MARTIN LUTHER.,A sword and buckler is our God.
45027,MARTIN LUTHER.,Innocent men have walked unshod
45028,MARTIN LUTHER.,"O'er burning ploughshares, and have trod"
45029,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Unharmed on serpents in their path,"
45030,MARTIN LUTHER.,And laughed to scorn the Devil's wrath!
45031,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45032,MARTIN LUTHER.,Safe in this Wartburg tower I stand
45033,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Where God hath led me by the hand,"
45034,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And look down, with a heart at ease,"
45035,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Over the pleasant neighborhoods,"
45036,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Over the vast Thuringian Woods,"
45037,MARTIN LUTHER.,"With flash of river, and gloom of trees,"
45038,MARTIN LUTHER.,"With castles crowning the dizzy heights,"
45039,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And farms and pastoral delights,"
45040,MARTIN LUTHER.,And the morning pouring everywhere
45041,MARTIN LUTHER.,Its golden glory on the air.
45042,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Safe, yes, safe am I here at last,"
45043,MARTIN LUTHER.,Safe from the overwhelming blast
45044,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Of the mouths of Hell, that followed me fast,"
45045,MARTIN LUTHER.,And the howling demons of despair
45046,MARTIN LUTHER.,That hunted me like a beast to his lair.
45047,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45048,MARTIN LUTHER.,Of our own might we nothing can;
45049,MARTIN LUTHER.,We soon are unprotected:
45050,MARTIN LUTHER.,"There fighteth for us the right Man,"
45051,MARTIN LUTHER.,Whom God himself elected.
45052,MARTIN LUTHER.,Who is He; ye exclaim?
45053,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Christus is his name,"
45054,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Lord of Sabaoth,"
45055,MARTIN LUTHER.,Very God in troth;
45056,MARTIN LUTHER.,The field He holds forever.
45057,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45058,MARTIN LUTHER.,Nothing can vex the Devil more
45059,MARTIN LUTHER.,Than the name of him whom we adore.
45060,MARTIN LUTHER.,Therefore doth it delight me best
45061,MARTIN LUTHER.,"To stand in the choir among the rest,"
45062,MARTIN LUTHER.,With the great organ trumpeting
45063,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Through its metallic tubes, and sing:"
45064,MARTIN LUTHER.,Et verbum caro factum est!
45065,MARTIN LUTHER.,"These words the devil cannot endure,"
45066,MARTIN LUTHER.,For he knoweth their meaning well!
45067,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Him they trouble and repel,"
45068,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Us they comfort and allure,"
45069,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And happy it were, if our delight"
45070,MARTIN LUTHER.,Were as great as his affright!
45071,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45072,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Yea, music is the Prophet's art;"
45073,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Among the gifts that God hath sent,"
45074,MARTIN LUTHER.,One of the most magnificent!
45075,MARTIN LUTHER.,It calms the agitated heart;
45076,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Temptations, evil thoughts, and all"
45077,MARTIN LUTHER.,"The passions that disturb the soul,"
45078,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Are quelled by its divine control,"
45079,MARTIN LUTHER.,"As the evil spirit fled from Saul,"
45080,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And his distemper was allayed,"
45081,MARTIN LUTHER.,When David took his harp and played.
45082,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45083,MARTIN LUTHER.,"This world may full of Devils be,"
45084,MARTIN LUTHER.,All ready to devour us;
45085,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Yet not so sore afraid are we,"
45086,MARTIN LUTHER.,They shall not overpower us.
45087,MARTIN LUTHER.,"This World's Prince, howe'er"
45088,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Fierce he may appear,"
45089,MARTIN LUTHER.,"He can harm us not,"
45090,MARTIN LUTHER.,"He is doomed, God wot!"
45091,MARTIN LUTHER.,One little word can slay him!
45092,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45093,MARTIN LUTHER.,Incredible it seems to some
45094,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And to myself a mystery,"
45095,MARTIN LUTHER.,"That such weak flesh and blood as we,"
45096,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Armed with no other shield or sword,"
45097,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Or other weapon than the Word,"
45098,MARTIN LUTHER.,Should combat and should overcome
45099,MARTIN LUTHER.,A spirit powerful as he!
45100,MARTIN LUTHER.,He summons forth the Pope of Rome
45101,MARTIN LUTHER.,"With all his diabolic crew,"
45102,MARTIN LUTHER.,His shorn and shaven retinue
45103,MARTIN LUTHER.,Of priests and children of the dark;
45104,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Kill! kill! they cry, the Heresiarch,"
45105,MARTIN LUTHER.,Who rouseth up all Christendom
45106,MARTIN LUTHER.,Against us; and at one fell blow
45107,MARTIN LUTHER.,Seeks the whole Church to overthrow!
45108,MARTIN LUTHER.,Not yet; my hour is not yet come.
45109,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45110,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Yesterday in an idle mood,"
45111,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Hunting with others in the wood,"
45112,MARTIN LUTHER.,"I did not pass the hours in vain,"
45113,MARTIN LUTHER.,For in the very heart of all
45114,MARTIN LUTHER.,"The joyous tumult raised around,"
45115,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Shouting of men, and baying of hound,"
45116,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And the bugle's blithe and cheery call,"
45117,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And echoes answering back again,"
45118,MARTIN LUTHER.,"From crags of the distant mountain chain,--"
45119,MARTIN LUTHER.,"In the very heart of this, I found"
45120,MARTIN LUTHER.,A mystery of grief and pain.
45121,MARTIN LUTHER.,It was an image of the power
45122,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Of Satan, hunting the world about,"
45123,MARTIN LUTHER.,"With his nets and traps and well-trained dogs,"
45124,MARTIN LUTHER.,"His bishops and priests and theologues,"
45125,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And all the rest of the rabble rout,"
45126,MARTIN LUTHER.,Seeking whom he may devour!
45127,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Enough I have had of hunting hares,"
45128,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Enough of these hours of idle mirth,"
45129,MARTIN LUTHER.,Enough of nets and traps and gins!
45130,MARTIN LUTHER.,The only hunting of any worth
45131,MARTIN LUTHER.,Is where I can pierce with javelins
45132,MARTIN LUTHER.,"The cunning foxes and wolves and bears,"
45133,MARTIN LUTHER.,"The whole iniquitous troop of beasts,"
45134,MARTIN LUTHER.,The Roman Pope and the Roman priests
45135,MARTIN LUTHER.,That sorely infest and afflict the earth!
45136,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Ye nuns, ye singing birds of the air!"
45137,MARTIN LUTHER.,"The fowler hath caught you in his snare,"
45138,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And keeps you safe in his gilded cage,"
45139,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Singing the song that never tires,"
45140,MARTIN LUTHER.,To lure down others from their nests;
45141,MARTIN LUTHER.,"How ye flutter and heat your breasts,"
45142,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Warm and soft with young desires,"
45143,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Against the cruel, pitiless wires,"
45144,MARTIN LUTHER.,Reclaiming your lost heritage!
45145,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Behold! a hand unbars the door,"
45146,MARTIN LUTHER.,Ye shall be captives held no more.
45147,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45148,MARTIN LUTHER.,"The Word they shall perforce let stand,"
45149,MARTIN LUTHER.,And little thanks they merit!
45150,MARTIN LUTHER.,"For He is with us in the land,"
45151,MARTIN LUTHER.,With gifts of his own Spirit!
45152,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Though they take our life,"
45153,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Goods, honors, child and wife,"
45154,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Lot these pass away,"
45155,MARTIN LUTHER.,Little gain have they;
45156,MARTIN LUTHER.,The Kingdom still remaineth!
45157,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45158,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Yea, it remaineth forevermore,"
45159,MARTIN LUTHER.,"However Satan may rage and roar,"
45160,MARTIN LUTHER.,Though often be whispers in my ears:
45161,MARTIN LUTHER.,What if thy doctrines false should be?
45162,MARTIN LUTHER.,And wrings from me a bitter sweat.
45163,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Then I put him to flight with jeers,"
45164,MARTIN LUTHER.,Saying: Saint Satan! pray for me;
45165,MARTIN LUTHER.,If thou thinkest I am not saved yet!
45166,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45167,MARTIN LUTHER.,And my mortal foes that lie in wait
45168,MARTIN LUTHER.,In every avenue and gate!
45169,MARTIN LUTHER.,"As to that odious monk John Tetzel,"
45170,MARTIN LUTHER.,Hawking about his hollow wares
45171,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Like a huckster at village fairs,"
45172,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And those mischievous fellows, Wetzel,"
45173,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Campanus, Carlstadt, Martin Cellarius,"
45174,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And all the busy, multifarious"
45175,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Heretics, and disciples of Arius,"
45176,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Half-learned, dunce-bold, dry and hard,"
45177,MARTIN LUTHER.,"They are not worthy of my regard,"
45178,MARTIN LUTHER.,Poor and humble as I am.
45179,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45180,MARTIN LUTHER.,"But ah! Erasmus of Rotterdam,"
45181,MARTIN LUTHER.,He is the vilest miscreant
45182,MARTIN LUTHER.,That ever walked this world below
45183,MARTIN LUTHER.,"A Momus, making his mock and mow,"
45184,MARTIN LUTHER.,"At Papist and at Protestant,"
45185,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Sneering at St. John and St. Paul,"
45186,MARTIN LUTHER.,"At God and Man, at one and all;"
45187,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And yet as hollow and false and drear,"
45188,MARTIN LUTHER.,"As a cracked pitcher to the ear,"
45189,MARTIN LUTHER.,And ever growing worse and worse!
45190,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Whenever I pray, I pray for a curse"
45191,MARTIN LUTHER.,"On Erasmus, the Insincere!"
45192,MARTIN LUTHER.,
45193,MARTIN LUTHER.,Philip Melanethon! thou alone

45201,MARTIN LUTHER.,"My Philip, prayest thou for me?"
45202,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Lifted above all earthly care,"

45204,MARTIN LUTHER.,Among the birds that day and night
45205,MARTIN LUTHER.,Upon the branches of tall trees
45206,MARTIN LUTHER.,"Sing their lauds and litanies,"

45214,MARTIN LUTHER.,"And the divine new births as well,"
45215,MARTIN LUTHER.,"That surely follow after these,"

45321,ACT I.,
45322,ACT I.,"The Lord descended from above,"

45326,ACT I.,
45327,ACT I.,On Cherubim and Seraphim
45328,ACT I.,"Right royally He rode,"

45333,ACT I.,I heard a great voice from the temple saying
45334,ACT I.,"Unto the Seven Angels, Go your ways;"
45335,ACT I.,Pour out the vials of the wrath of God
45336,ACT I.,Upon the earth.  And the First Angel went
45337,ACT I.,And poured his vial on the earth; and straight
45338,ACT I.,There fell a noisome and a grievous sore
45339,ACT I.,"On them which had the birth-mark of the Beast,"
45340,ACT I.,And them which worshipped and adored his image.
45341,ACT I.,On us hath fallen this grievous pestilence.
45342,ACT I.,There is a sense of terror in the air;
45343,ACT I.,And apparitions of things horrible
45344,ACT I.,Are seen by many; from the sky above us
45345,ACT I.,The stars fall; and beneath us the earth quakes!
45346,ACT I.,"The sound of drums at midnight from afar,"
45347,ACT I.,"The sound of horsemen riding to and fro,"
45348,ACT I.,As if the gates of the invisible world
45349,ACT I.,"Were opened, and the dead came forth to warn us,--"
45350,ACT I.,All these are omens of some dire disaster
45351,ACT I.,"Impending over us, and soon to fall,"
45352,ACT I.,"Moreover, in the language of the Prophet,"
45353,ACT I.,"Death is again come up into our windows,"
45354,ACT I.,"To cut off little children from without,"
45355,ACT I.,And young men from the streets.  And in the midst
45356,ACT I.,Of all these supernatural threats and warnings
45357,ACT I.,Doth Heresy uplift its horrid head;
45358,ACT I.,A vision of Sin more awful and appalling
45359,ACT I.,"Than any phantasm, ghost, or apparition,"
45360,ACT I.,As arguing and portending some enlargement
45361,ACT I.,Of the mysterious Power of Darkness!

45363,ACT I.,"EDITH, barefooted, and clad in sackcloth, with her hair hanging"

45396,EDITH.,EDITH.
45397,EDITH.,The law of God is greater than your laws!
45398,EDITH.,"Ye build your church with blood, your town with crime;"
45399,EDITH.,The heads thereof give judgment for reward;
45400,EDITH.,The priests thereof teach only for their hire;
45401,EDITH.,Your laws condemn the innocent to death;
45402,EDITH.,And against this I bear my testimony!
45403,EDITH.,
45404,NORTON.,NORTON.
45405,NORTON.,What testimony?
45406,NORTON.,
45407,EDITH.,EDITH.
45408,EDITH.,"That of the Holy Spirit,"

45412,NORTON.,The laborer is worthy of his hire.

45415,EDITH.,"Yet our great Master did not teach for hire,"
45416,EDITH.,And the Apostles without purse or scrip
45417,EDITH.,Went forth to do his work.  Behold this box
45418,EDITH.,Beneath thy pulpit.  Is it for the poor?
45419,EDITH.,Thou canst not answer.  It is for the Priest
45420,EDITH.,And against this I bear my testimony.
45421,EDITH.,
45422,NORTON.,NORTON.
45423,NORTON.,Away with all these Heretics and Quakers!
45424,NORTON.,"Quakers, forsooth!  Because a quaking fell"
45425,NORTON.,"On Daniel, at beholding of the Vision,"
45426,NORTON.,Must ye needs shake and quake?  Because Isaiah
45427,NORTON.,"Went stripped and barefoot, must ye wail and howl?"
45428,NORTON.,Must ye go stripped and naked? must ye make
45429,NORTON.,"A wailing like the dragons, and a mourning"
45430,NORTON.,As of the owls?  Ye verify the adage
45431,NORTON.,That Satan is God's ape!  Away with them!
45432,NORTON.,
45433,NORTON.,"Tumult.  The Quakers are driven out with violence, EDITH"
45434,NORTON.,following slowly.  The congregation retires in confusion.
45435,NORTON.,
45436,NORTON.,Thus freely do the Reprobates commit
45437,NORTON.,Such measure of iniquity as fits them
45438,NORTON.,For the intended measure of God's wrath
45439,NORTON.,And even in violating God's commands
45440,NORTON.,Are they fulfilling the divine decree!
45441,NORTON.,The will of man is but an instrument
45442,NORTON.,Disposed and predetermined to its action
45443,NORTON.,"According unto the decree of God,"
45444,NORTON.,Being as much subordinate thereto
45445,NORTON.,As is the axe unto the hewer's hand!

45452,NORTON.,"The blast of corn, the death of our young men,"
45453,NORTON.,"Our sufferings in all precious, pleasant things,"
45454,NORTON.,"Are manifestations of the wrath divine,"
45455,NORTON.,Signs of God's controversy with New England.
45456,NORTON.,"These emissaries of the Evil One,"
45457,NORTON.,"These servants and ambassadors of Satan,"
45458,NORTON.,Are but commissioned executioners
45459,NORTON.,Of God's vindictive and deserved displeasure.
45460,NORTON.,We must receive them as the Roman Bishop
45461,NORTON.,"Once received Attila, saying, I rejoice"
45462,NORTON.,"You have come safe, whom I esteem to be"
45463,NORTON.,"The scourge of God, sent to chastise his people."
45464,NORTON.,"This very heresy, perchance, may serve"

45466,NORTON.,With you I leave it; but do not neglect

45468,NORTON.,
45469,ENDICOTT.,ENDICOTT.
45470,ENDICOTT.,And what more can be done?
45471,ENDICOTT.,
45472,NORTON.,NORTON.
45473,NORTON.,The hand that cut
45474,NORTON.,The Red Cross from the colors of the king
45475,NORTON.,Can cut the red heart from this heresy.
45476,NORTON.,Fear not.  All blasphemies immediate
45477,NORTON.,And heresies turbulent must be suppressed
45478,NORTON.,By civil power.
45479,NORTON.,
45480,ENDICOTT.,ENDICOTT.
45481,ENDICOTT.,But in what way suppressed?
45482,ENDICOTT.,
45483,NORTON.,NORTON.
45484,NORTON.,The Book of Deuteronomy declares
45485,NORTON.,"That if thy son, thy daughter, or thy wife,"
45486,NORTON.,"Ay, or the friend which is as thine own soul,"
45487,NORTON.,"Entice thee secretly, and say to thee,"
45488,NORTON.,"Let us serve other gods, then shalt thine eye"
45489,NORTON.,"Not pity him, but thou shalt surely kill him,"
45490,NORTON.,And thine own hand shall be the first upon him
45491,NORTON.,To slay him.
45492,NORTON.,
45493,ENDICOTT.,ENDICOTT.
45494,ENDICOTT.,Four already have been slain;
45495,ENDICOTT.,And others banished upon pain of death.
45496,ENDICOTT.,"But they come back again to meet their doom,"
45497,ENDICOTT.,Bringing the linen for their winding-sheets.
45498,ENDICOTT.,"We must not go too far.  In truth, I shrink"
45499,ENDICOTT.,From shedding of more blood.  The people murmur
45500,ENDICOTT.,At our severity.
45501,ENDICOTT.,
45502,NORTON.,NORTON.
45503,NORTON.,Then let them murmur!
45504,NORTON.,Truth is relentless; justice never wavers;
45505,NORTON.,The greatest firmness is the greatest mercy;
45506,NORTON.,The noble order of the Magistracy
45507,NORTON.,"Cometh immediately from God, and yet"
45508,NORTON.,This noble order of the Magistracy
45509,NORTON.,Is by these Heretics despised and outraged.
45510,NORTON.,
45511,ENDICOTT.,ENDICOTT.
45512,ENDICOTT.,"To-night they sleep in prison.  If they die,"
45513,ENDICOTT.,They cannot say that we have caused their death.
45514,ENDICOTT.,"We do but guard the passage, with the sword"
45515,ENDICOTT.,"Pointed towards them; if they dash upon it,"
45516,ENDICOTT.,"Their blood will be on their own heads, not ours."
45517,ENDICOTT.,
45518,NORTON.,NORTON.
45519,NORTON.,Enough.  I ask no more.  My predecessor
45520,NORTON.,Coped only with the milder heresies
45521,NORTON.,Of Antinomians and of Anabaptists.
45522,NORTON.,He was not born to wrestle with these fiends.
45523,NORTON.,Chrysostom in his pulpit; Augustine
45524,NORTON.,In disputation; Timothy in his house!
45525,NORTON.,The lantern of St. Botolph's ceased to burn
45526,NORTON.,When from the portals of that church he came
45527,NORTON.,To be a burning and a shining light
45528,NORTON.,"Here in the wilderness.  And, as he lay"
45529,NORTON.,"On his death-bed, he saw me in a vision"
45530,NORTON.,Ride on a snow-white horse into this town.
45531,NORTON.,"His vision was prophetic; thus I came,"
45532,NORTON.,"A terror to the impenitent, and Death"
45533,NORTON.,On the pale horse of the Apocalypse

45551,UPSALL.,WALTER MERRY (entering and looking round him).
45552,UPSALL.,All silent as a graveyard!  No one stirring;
45553,UPSALL.,"No footfall in the street, no sound of voices!"
45554,UPSALL.,"By righteous punishment and perseverance,"
45555,UPSALL.,"And perseverance in that punishment,"
45556,UPSALL.,At last I have brought this contumacious town
45557,UPSALL.,To strict observance of the Sabbath day.
45558,UPSALL.,"Those wanton gospellers, the pigeons yonder,"
45559,UPSALL.,Are now the only Sabbath-breakers left.
45560,UPSALL.,"I cannot put them down.  As if to taunt me,"
45561,UPSALL.,They gather every Sabbath afternoon
45562,UPSALL.,"In noisy congregation on my roof,"
45563,UPSALL.,"Billing and cooing.  Whir! take that, ye Quakers."
45564,UPSALL.,
45565,UPSALL.,Throws a stone at the pigeons.  Sees UPSALL.

45578,UPSALL.,"Yea, I have chosen rather to worship God"
45579,UPSALL.,Sitting in silence here at my own door.
45580,UPSALL.,
45581,MERRY.,MERRY.
45582,MERRY.,Worship the Devil!  You this day have broken
45583,MERRY.,"Three of our strictest laws.  First, by abstaining"

45587,UPSALL.,UPSALL.
45588,UPSALL.,Not one step.

45593,MERRY.,You have been in the street with other intent

45604,MERRY.,"Angels in broad-brimmed hats and russet cloaks,"

45606,MERRY.,Into the Meeting-house this afternoon
45607,MERRY.,More in the shape of devils than of angels.
45608,MERRY.,The women screamed and fainted; and the boys

45645,WHARTON.,I saw their noble death.  They to the scaffold

45658,WHARTON.,"Our sister Mary, likewise, the meek woman,"

47512,ENDICOTT.,ENDICOTT.
47513,ENDICOTT.,It means we shall no longer rule the Province;

47515,ENDICOTT.,"Authority, respect for Magistrates,"
47516,ENDICOTT.,The peace and welfare of the Commonwealth.
47517,ENDICOTT.,If all the knaves upon this continent
47518,ENDICOTT.,"Can make appeal to England, and so thwart"
47519,ENDICOTT.,"The ends of truth and justice by delay,"
47520,ENDICOTT.,Our power is gone forever.  We are nothing

47526,BELLINGHAM.,I confess

47535,ENDICOTT.,"I shall not live to fight the battle for you,"
47536,ENDICOTT.,I am a man disgraced in every way;
47537,ENDICOTT.,This order takes from me my self-respect

47539,ENDICOTT.,"Yes, my death-warrant, but must be obeyed!"
47540,ENDICOTT.,"Take it, and see that it is executed"
47541,ENDICOTT.,"So far as this, that all be set at large;"
47542,ENDICOTT.,But see that none of them be sent to England
47543,ENDICOTT.,"To bear false witness, and to spread reports"

47593,NORTON.,This William Brand of yours has tried to beat

47595,NORTON.,"And, if he has been beaten in like manner,"
47596,NORTON.,"It is but justice, and I will appear"
47597,NORTON.,In his behalf that did so.  I suppose
47598,NORTON.,That he refused to work.
47599,NORTON.,
47600,UPSALL.,UPSALL.

47615,UPSALL.,"Down with this weak and cowardly concession,"
47616,UPSALL.,This flag of truce with Satan and with Sin!
47617,UPSALL.,I fling it in his face!  I trample it
47618,UPSALL.,"Under my feet!  It is his cunning craft,"
47619,UPSALL.,"The masterpiece of his diplomacy,"
47620,UPSALL.,To cry and plead for boundless toleration.
47621,UPSALL.,But toleration is the first-born child
47622,UPSALL.,Of all abominations and deceits.
47623,UPSALL.,There is no room in Christ's triumphant army

47646,EDITH.,How silent everywhere!  Alone and lost
47647,EDITH.,"Here in the forest, there comes over me"

47662,EDITH.,And yet I must go back; for ever louder
47663,EDITH.,"I hear the inward calling of the Spirit,"
47664,EDITH.,And must obey the voice.  O woods that wear
47665,EDITH.,"Your golden crown of martyrdom, blood-stained,"
47666,EDITH.,"From you I learn a lesson of submission,"

52237,JULIA.,"The horror of that night, when Barbarossa,"

52239,JULIA.,To seize me for the Sultan Soliman;
52240,JULIA.,"How in the dead of night, when all were sleeping,"
52241,JULIA.,"He scaled the castle wall; how I escaped,"
52242,JULIA.,"And in my night-dress, mounting a swift steed,"
52243,JULIA.,"Fled to the mountains, and took refuge there"
52244,JULIA.,Among the brigands.  Then of all my friends
52245,JULIA.,The Cardinal Ippolito was first
52246,JULIA.,To come with his retainers to my rescue.
52247,JULIA.,Could I refuse the only boon he asked

52254,VITTORIA.,He rides through Rome with a long retinue
52255,VITTORIA.,Of Ethiopians and Numidians
52256,VITTORIA.,"And Turks and Tartars, in fantastic dresses,"

52264,JULIA.,"A poet, a musician, and a scholar;"
52265,JULIA.,"Master of many languages, and a player"
52266,JULIA.,"On many instruments.  In Rome, his palace"
52267,JULIA.,Is the asylum of all men distinguished
52268,JULIA.,"In art or science, and all Florentines"

52294,VITTORIA.,A lion all men fear and none can tame;
52295,VITTORIA.,"A man that all men honor, and the model"
52296,VITTORIA.,"That all should follow; one who works and prays,"
52297,VITTORIA.,"For work is prayer, and consecrates his life"
52298,VITTORIA.,"To the sublime ideal of his art,"
52299,VITTORIA.,Till art and life are one; a man who holds
52300,VITTORIA.,"Such place in all men's thoughts, that when they speak"
52301,VITTORIA.,"Of great things done, or to be done, his name"
52302,VITTORIA.,Is ever on their lips.

52305,JULIA.,You too can paint
52306,JULIA.,"The portrait of your hero, and in colors"

52369,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Were not the paintings on the Sistine ceiling
52370,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Enough for them?  They saw the Hebrew leader
52371,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Waiting, and clutching his tempestuous beard,"
52372,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But heeded not.  The bones of Julius
52373,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Shook in their sepulchre.  I heard the sound;
52374,MICHAEL ANGELO.,They only heard the sound of their own voices.
52375,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
52376,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Are there no other artists here in Rome
52377,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To do this work, that they must needs seek me?"
52378,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Fra Bastian, my Era Bastian, might have done it;"
52379,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But he is lost to art. The Papal Seals,"
52380,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Like leaden weights upon a dead man's eyes,"
52381,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Press down his lids; and so the burden falls
52382,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"On Michael Angelo, Chief Architect"
52383,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And Painter of the Apostolic Palace.
52384,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That is the title they cajole me with,"
52385,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To make me do their work and leave my own;
52386,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But having once begun, I turn not back."

52388,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To the four corners of the earth, and wake"
52389,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The dead to judgment!  Ye recording angels,"
52390,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Open your books and read?  Ye dead awake!
52391,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Rise from your graves, drowsy and drugged with death,"

52395,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In happy hours, when the imagination"
52396,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Wakes like a wind at midnight, and the soul"
52397,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Trembles in all its leaves, it is a joy"
52398,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To be uplifted on its wings, and listen"
52399,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To the prophetic voices in the air
52400,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That call us onward.  Then the work we do
52401,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Is a delight, and the obedient hand"
52402,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Never grows weary.  But how different is it
52403,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"En the disconsolate, discouraged hours,"
52404,MICHAEL ANGELO.,When all the wisdom of the world appears
52405,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As trivial as the gossip of a nurse
52406,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In a sick-room, and all our work seems useless,"
52407,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
52408,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"What is it guides my hand, what thoughts possess me,"

52410,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Where she will be hereafter?  O sweet dreams,"
52411,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That through the vacant chambers of my heart
52412,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Walk in the silence, as familiar phantoms"
52413,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Frequent an ancient house, what will ye with me?"
52414,MICHAEL ANGELO.,'T is said that Emperors write their names in green

52430,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
52431,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"What matters it to me, whose countenance"
52432,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Is like the Laocoon's, full of pain; whose forehead"
52433,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Is a ploughed harvest-field, where three-score years"
52434,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Have sown in sorrow and have reaped in anguish;
52435,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To me, the artisan, to whom all women"
52436,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Have been as if they were not, or at most"
52437,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A sudden rush of pigeons in the air,"
52438,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A flutter of wings, a sound, and then a silence?"
52439,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I am too old for love; I am too old
52440,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To flatter and delude myself with visions
52441,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of never-ending friendship with fair women,"

52605,MICHAEL ANGELO.,We may together view the site.

52607,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
52608,VITTORIA.,I thank you.
52609,VITTORIA.,I did not venture to request so much.

52611,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
52612,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Let us now go to the old walls you spake of,"
52613,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Vossignoria--
52614,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
52615,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
52616,VITTORIA.,"What, again, Maestro?"
52617,VITTORIA.,
52618,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
52619,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Pardon me, Messer Claudio, if once more"
52620,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I use the ancient courtesies of speech.
52621,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I am too old to change.

52626,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.
52627,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,
52628,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,A richly furnished apartment in the Palace of CARDINAL IPPOLITO.
52629,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,Night.
52630,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,
52631,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,"JACOPO NARDI, an old man, alone."
52632,CARDINAL IPPOLITO.,
52633,NARDI.,NARDI.
52634,NARDI.,"I am bewildered.  These Numidian slaves,"
52635,NARDI.,In strange attire; these endless ante-chambers;
52636,NARDI.,"This lighted hall, with all its golden splendors,"
52637,NARDI.,"Pictures, and statues!  Can this be the dwelling"
52638,NARDI.,Of a disciple of that lowly Man
52639,NARDI.,Who had not where to lay his head?  These statues
52640,NARDI.,"Are not of Saints; nor is this a Madonna,"
52641,NARDI.,"This lovely face, that with such tender eyes"
52642,NARDI.,Looks down upon me from the painted canvas.
52643,NARDI.,My heart begins to fail me.  What can he
52644,NARDI.,Who lives in boundless luxury at Rome
52645,NARDI.,"Care for the imperilled liberties of Florence,"
52646,NARDI.,"Her people, her Republic?  Ah, the rich"
52647,NARDI.,Feel not the pangs of banishment.  All doors
52648,NARDI.,"Are open to them, and all hands extended,"
52649,NARDI.,The poor alone are outcasts; they who risked
52650,NARDI.,"All they possessed for liberty, and lost;"
52651,NARDI.,"And wander through the world without a friend,"
52652,NARDI.,"Sick, comfortless, distressed, unknown, uncared for."
52653,NARDI.,
52654,NARDI.,"Enter CARDINAL HIPPOLITO, in Spanish cloak and slouched hat."
52655,NARDI.,
52656,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52657,IPPOLITO.,I pray you pardon me that I have kept you
52658,IPPOLITO.,Waiting so long alone.
52659,IPPOLITO.,
52660,NARDI.,NARDI.
52661,NARDI.,I wait to see
52662,NARDI.,The Cardinal.
52663,NARDI.,
52664,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52665,IPPOLITO.,I am the Cardinal.
52666,IPPOLITO.,And you?
52667,IPPOLITO.,
52668,NARDI.,NARDI.
52669,NARDI.,Jacopo Nardi.
52670,NARDI.,
52671,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52672,IPPOLITO.,You are welcome
52673,IPPOLITO.,I was expecting you.  Philippo Strozzi
52674,IPPOLITO.,Had told me of your coming.
52675,IPPOLITO.,
52676,NARDI.,NARDI.
52677,NARDI.,'T was his son
52678,NARDI.,That brought me to your door.
52679,NARDI.,
52680,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52681,IPPOLITO.,"Pray you, be seated."
52682,IPPOLITO.,"You seem astonished at the garb I wear,"
52683,IPPOLITO.,"But at my time of life, and with my habits,"
52684,IPPOLITO.,The petticoats of a Cardinal would be--
52685,IPPOLITO.,"Troublesome; I could neither ride nor walk,"
52686,IPPOLITO.,"Nor do a thousand things, if I were dressed"
52687,IPPOLITO.,Like an old dowager.  It were putting wine
52688,IPPOLITO.,Young as the young Astyanax into goblets
52689,IPPOLITO.,As old as Priam.
52690,IPPOLITO.,
52691,NARDI.,NARDI.
52692,NARDI.,"Oh, your Eminence"
52693,NARDI.,Knows best what you should wear.
52694,NARDI.,
52695,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52696,IPPOLITO.,"Dear Messer Nardi,"
52697,IPPOLITO.,You are no stranger to me.  I have read
52698,IPPOLITO.,Your excellent translation of the books
52699,IPPOLITO.,"Of Titus Livius, the historian"
52700,IPPOLITO.,"Of Rome, and model of all historians"
52701,IPPOLITO.,That shall come after him.  It does you honor;
52702,IPPOLITO.,But greater honor still the love you bear
52703,IPPOLITO.,"To Florence, our dear country, and whose annals"
52704,IPPOLITO.,"I hope your hand will write, in happier days"
52705,IPPOLITO.,Than we now see.
52706,IPPOLITO.,
52707,NARDI.,NARDI.
52708,NARDI.,Your Eminence will pardon
52709,NARDI.,The lateness of the hour.
52710,NARDI.,
52711,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52712,IPPOLITO.,The hours I count not
52713,IPPOLITO.,"As a sun-dial; but am like a clock,"
52714,IPPOLITO.,That tells the time as well by night as day.
52715,IPPOLITO.,So no excuse.  I know what brings you here.
52716,IPPOLITO.,You come to speak of Florence.
52717,IPPOLITO.,
52718,NARDI.,NARDI.
52719,NARDI.,And her woes.
52720,NARDI.,
52721,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52722,IPPOLITO.,"The Duke, my cousin, the black Alessandro,"
52723,IPPOLITO.,"Whose mother was a Moorish slave, that fed"
52724,IPPOLITO.,"The sheep upon Lorenzo's farm, still lives"
52725,IPPOLITO.,And reigns.
52726,IPPOLITO.,
52727,NARDI.,NARDI.
52728,NARDI.,"Alas, that such a scourge"
52729,NARDI.,Should fall on such a city!
52730,NARDI.,
52731,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52732,IPPOLITO.,"When he dies,"
52733,IPPOLITO.,"The Wild Boar in the gardens of Lorenzo,"
52734,IPPOLITO.,"The beast obscene, should be the monument"
52735,IPPOLITO.,Of this bad man.
52736,IPPOLITO.,
52737,NARDI.,NARDI.
52738,NARDI.,He walks the streets at night
52739,NARDI.,"With revellers, insulting honest men."
52740,NARDI.,No house is sacred from his lusts.  The convents
52741,NARDI.,"Are turned by him to brothels, and the honor"
52742,NARDI.,Of women and all ancient pious customs
52743,NARDI.,Are quite forgotten now.  The offices
52744,NARDI.,Of the Priori and Gonfalonieri
52745,NARDI.,Have been abolished.  All the magistrates
52746,NARDI.,Are now his creatures.  Liberty is dead.
52747,NARDI.,The very memory of all honest living
52748,NARDI.,"Is wiped away, and even our Tuscan tongue"
52749,NARDI.,Corrupted to a Lombard dialect.
52750,NARDI.,
52751,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52752,IPPOLITO.,And worst of all his impious hand has broken
52753,IPPOLITO.,"The Martinella,--our great battle bell,"
52754,IPPOLITO.,"That, sounding through three centuries, has led"
52755,IPPOLITO.,"The Florentines to victory,--lest its voice"
52756,IPPOLITO.,Should waken in their souls some memory
52757,IPPOLITO.,Of far-off times of glory.
52758,IPPOLITO.,
52759,NARDI.,NARDI.
52760,NARDI.,What a change
52761,NARDI.,Ten little years have made!  We all remember
52762,NARDI.,"Those better days, when Niccola Capponi,"
52763,NARDI.,"The Gonfaloniere, from the windows"
52764,NARDI.,"Of the Old Palace, with the blast of trumpets,"
52765,NARDI.,Proclaimed to the inhabitants that Christ
52766,NARDI.,Was chosen King of Florence; and already
52767,NARDI.,"Christ is dethroned, and slain, and in his stead"
52768,NARDI.,"Reigns Lucifer!  Alas, alas, for Florence!"
52769,NARDI.,
52770,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52771,IPPOLITO.,"Lilies with lilies, said Savonarola;"
52772,IPPOLITO.,"Florence and France!  But I say Florence only,"
52773,IPPOLITO.,Or only with the Emperor's hand to help us
52774,IPPOLITO.,In sweeping out the rubbish.
52775,IPPOLITO.,
52776,NARDI.,NARDI.
52777,NARDI.,Little hope
52778,NARDI.,Of help is there from him.  He has betrothed
52779,NARDI.,His daughter Margaret to this shameless Duke.
52780,NARDI.,What hope have we from such an Emperor?
52781,NARDI.,
52782,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52783,IPPOLITO.,"Baccio Valori and Philippo Strozzi,"
52784,IPPOLITO.,"Once the Duke's friends and intimates are with us,"
52785,IPPOLITO.,And Cardinals Salvati and Ridolfi.
52786,IPPOLITO.,"We shall soon see, then, as Valori says,"
52787,IPPOLITO.,"Whether the Duke can best spare honest men,"
52788,IPPOLITO.,Or honest men the Duke.
52789,IPPOLITO.,
52790,NARDI.,NARDI.
52791,NARDI.,We have determined
52792,NARDI.,"To send ambassadors to Spain, and lay"
52793,NARDI.,"Our griefs before the Emperor, though I fear"
52794,NARDI.,More than I hope.
52795,NARDI.,
52796,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52797,IPPOLITO.,The Emperor is busy
52798,IPPOLITO.,"With this new war against the Algerines,"
52799,IPPOLITO.,And has no time to listen to complaints
52800,IPPOLITO.,"From our ambassadors; nor will I trust them,"
52801,IPPOLITO.,But go myself.  All is in readiness
52802,IPPOLITO.,"For my departure, and to-morrow morning"
52803,IPPOLITO.,"I shall go down to Itri, where I meet"
52804,IPPOLITO.,"Dante da Castiglione and some others,"
52805,IPPOLITO.,"Republicans and fugitives from Florence,"
52806,IPPOLITO.,"And then take ship at Gaeta, and go"
52807,IPPOLITO.,To join the Emperor in his new crusade
52808,IPPOLITO.,Against the Turk.  I shall have time enough
52809,IPPOLITO.,And opportunity to plead our cause.
52810,IPPOLITO.,
52811,IPPOLITO.,"NARDI, rising."
52812,IPPOLITO.,"It is an inspiration, and I hail it"
52813,IPPOLITO.,As of good omen.  May the power that sends it
52814,IPPOLITO.,"Bless our beloved country, and restore"
52815,IPPOLITO.,Its banished citizens.  The soul of Florence
52816,IPPOLITO.,Is now outside its gates.  What lies within
52817,IPPOLITO.,"Is but a corpse, corrupted and corrupting."
52818,IPPOLITO.,"Heaven help us all, I will not tarry longer,"
52819,IPPOLITO.,For you have need of rest.  Good-night.
52820,IPPOLITO.,
52821,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52822,IPPOLITO.,Good-night.
52823,IPPOLITO.,
52824,IPPOLITO.,Enter FRA SEBASTIANO; Turkish attendants.
52825,IPPOLITO.,
52826,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52827,IPPOLITO.,"Fra Bastiano, how your portly presence"
52828,IPPOLITO.,Contrasts with that of the spare Florentine
52829,IPPOLITO.,Who has just left me!
52830,IPPOLITO.,
52831,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52832,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"As we passed each other,"
52833,FRA SEBASTIANO.,I saw that he was weeping.
52834,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52835,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52836,IPPOLITO.,Poor old man!
52837,IPPOLITO.,
52838,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52839,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Who is he?
52840,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52841,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52842,IPPOLITO.,Jacopo Nardi.  A brave soul;
52843,IPPOLITO.,"One of the Fuoruseiti, and the best"
52844,IPPOLITO.,And noblest of them all; but he has made me
52845,IPPOLITO.,Sad with his sadness.  As I look on you
52846,IPPOLITO.,My heart grows lighter.  I behold a man
52847,IPPOLITO.,"Who lives in an ideal world, apart"
52848,IPPOLITO.,"From all the rude collisions of our life,"
52849,IPPOLITO.,In a calm atmosphere.
52850,IPPOLITO.,
52851,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52852,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Your Eminence
52853,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Is surely jesting.  If you knew the life
52854,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Of artists as I know it, you might think"
52855,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Far otherwise.
52856,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52857,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52858,IPPOLITO.,But wherefore should I jest?
52859,IPPOLITO.,"The world of art is an ideal world,--"
52860,IPPOLITO.,"The world I love, and that I fain would live in;"
52861,IPPOLITO.,"So speak to me of artists and of art,"
52862,IPPOLITO.,"Of all the painters, sculptors, and musicians"
52863,IPPOLITO.,That now illustrate Rome.
52864,IPPOLITO.,
52865,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52866,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Of the musicians,"
52867,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"I know but Goudimel, the brave maestro"
52868,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"And chapel-master of his Holiness,"
52869,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Who trains the Papal choir.
52870,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52871,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52872,IPPOLITO.,"In church this morning,"
52873,IPPOLITO.,"I listened to a mass of Goudimel,"
52874,IPPOLITO.,"Divinely chanted.  In the Incarnatus,"
52875,IPPOLITO.,"In lieu of Latin words, the tenor sang"
52876,IPPOLITO.,"With infinite tenderness, in plain Italian,"
52877,IPPOLITO.,A Neapolitan love-song.
52878,IPPOLITO.,
52879,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52880,FRA SEBASTIANO.,You amaze me.
52881,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Was it a wanton song?
52882,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52883,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52884,IPPOLITO.,Not a divine one.
52885,IPPOLITO.,"I am not over-scrupulous, as you know,"
52886,IPPOLITO.,"In word or deed, yet such a song as that."
52887,IPPOLITO.,"Sung by the tenor of the Papal choir,"
52888,IPPOLITO.,"And in a Papal mass, seemed out of place;"
52889,IPPOLITO.,There's something wrong in it.
52890,IPPOLITO.,
52891,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52892,FRA SEBASTIANO.,There's something wrong
52893,FRA SEBASTIANO.,In everything.  We cannot make the world
52894,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Go right.  'T is not my business to reform
52895,FRA SEBASTIANO.,The Papal choir.
52896,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52897,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52898,IPPOLITO.,"Nor mine, thank Heaven."
52899,IPPOLITO.,Then tell me of the artists.
52900,IPPOLITO.,
52901,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52902,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Naming one
52903,FRA SEBASTIANO.,I name them all; for there is only one.
52904,FRA SEBASTIANO.,His name is Messer Michael Angelo.
52905,FRA SEBASTIANO.,All art and artists of the present day
52906,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Centre in him.
52907,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52908,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52909,IPPOLITO.,You count yourself as nothing!
52910,IPPOLITO.,
52911,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52912,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Or less than nothing, since I am at best"
52913,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Only a portrait-painter; one who draws
52914,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"With greater or less skill, as best he may,"
52915,FRA SEBASTIANO.,The features of a face.
52916,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52917,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52918,IPPOLITO.,And you have had
52919,IPPOLITO.,"The honor, nay, the glory, of portraying"
52920,IPPOLITO.,Julia Gonzaga!  Do you count as nothing
52921,IPPOLITO.,A privilege like that?  See there the portrait
52922,IPPOLITO.,Rebuking you with its divine expression.
52923,IPPOLITO.,Are you not penitent?  He whose skilful hand
52924,IPPOLITO.,Painted that lovely picture has not right
52925,IPPOLITO.,To vilipend the art of portrait-painting.
52926,IPPOLITO.,But what of Michael Angelo?
52927,IPPOLITO.,
52928,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52929,FRA SEBASTIANO.,But lately
52930,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Strolling together down the crowded Corso,"
52931,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"We stopped, well pleased, to see your Eminence"
52932,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Pass on an Arab steed, a noble creature,"
52933,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Which Michael Angelo, who is a lover"
52934,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Of all things beautiful, especially"
52935,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"When they are Arab horses, much admired,"
52936,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And could not praise enough.
52937,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52938,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"IPPOLITO, to an attendant."
52939,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Hassan, to-morrow,"
52940,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"When I am gone, but not till I am gone,--"
52941,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Be careful about that,--take Barbarossa"
52942,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"To Messer Michael Angelo, the sculptor,"
52943,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Who lives there at Macello dei Corvi,"
52944,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Near to the Capitol; and take besides
52945,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Some ten mule-loads of provender, and say"
52946,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Your master sends them to him as a present.
52947,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52948,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52949,FRA SEBASTIANO.,A princely gift.  Though Michael Angelo
52950,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Refuses presents from his Holiness,"
52951,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Yours he will not refuse.
52952,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52953,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52954,IPPOLITO.,You think him like
52955,IPPOLITO.,"Thymoetes, who received the wooden horse"
52956,IPPOLITO.,Into the walls of Troy.  That book of Virgil
52957,IPPOLITO.,"Have I translated in Italian verse,"
52958,IPPOLITO.,"And shall, some day, when we have leisure for it,"
52959,IPPOLITO.,Be pleased to read you.  When I speak of Troy
52960,IPPOLITO.,I am reminded of another town
52961,IPPOLITO.,"And of a lovelier Helen, our dear Countess"
52962,IPPOLITO.,"Julia Gonzaga.  You remember, surely,"
52963,IPPOLITO.,"The adventure with the corsair Barbarossa,"
52964,IPPOLITO.,And all that followed?
52965,IPPOLITO.,
52966,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52967,FRA SEBASTIANO.,A most strange adventure;
52968,FRA SEBASTIANO.,A tale as marvellous and full of wonder
52969,FRA SEBASTIANO.,As any in Boccaccio or Sacchetti;
52970,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Almost incredible!
52971,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52972,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52973,IPPOLITO.,Were I a painter
52974,IPPOLITO.,I should not want a better theme than that:
52975,IPPOLITO.,The lovely lady fleeing through the night
52976,IPPOLITO.,In wild disorder; and the brigands' camp
52977,IPPOLITO.,With the red fire-light on their swarthy faces.
52978,IPPOLITO.,Could you not paint it for me?
52979,IPPOLITO.,
52980,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52981,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"No, not I."
52982,FRA SEBASTIANO.,It is not in my line.
52983,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52984,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52985,IPPOLITO.,Then you shall paint
52986,IPPOLITO.,"The portrait of the corsair, when we bring him"
52987,IPPOLITO.,A prisoner chained to Naples: for I feel
52988,IPPOLITO.,Something like admiration for a man
52989,IPPOLITO.,Who dared this strange adventure.
52990,IPPOLITO.,
52991,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
52992,FRA SEBASTIANO.,I will do it.
52993,FRA SEBASTIANO.,But catch the corsair first.
52994,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
52995,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
52996,IPPOLITO.,You may begin
52997,IPPOLITO.,"To-morrow with the sword.  Hassan, come hither;"
52998,IPPOLITO.,Bring me the Turkish scimitar that hangs
52999,IPPOLITO.,Beneath the picture yonder.  Now unsheathe it.
53000,IPPOLITO.,'T is a Damascus blade; you see the inscription
53001,IPPOLITO.,"In Arabic: La Allah illa Allah,--"
53002,IPPOLITO.,There is no God but God.
53003,IPPOLITO.,
53004,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
53005,FRA SEBASTIANO.,How beautiful
53006,FRA SEBASTIANO.,In fashion and in finish!  It is perfect.
53007,FRA SEBASTIANO.,The Arsenal of Venice can not boast
53008,FRA SEBASTIANO.,A finer sword.
53009,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
53010,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
53011,IPPOLITO.,You like it? It is yours.
53012,IPPOLITO.,
53013,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
53014,FRA SEBASTIANO.,You do not mean it.
53015,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
53016,IPPOLITO.,IPPOLITO.
53017,IPPOLITO.,"I am not a Spaniard,"
53018,IPPOLITO.,To say that it is yours and not to mean it.
53019,IPPOLITO.,I have at Itri a whole armory
53020,IPPOLITO.,Full of such weapons.  When you paint the portrait
53021,IPPOLITO.,"Of Barbarossa, it will be of use."
53022,IPPOLITO.,You have not been rewarded as you should be
53023,IPPOLITO.,For painting the Gonzaga.  Throw this bauble

53036,IPPOLITO.,"And morning, noon, and night the ceaseless sound"
53037,IPPOLITO.,Of convent bells.  I must be gone from here;
53038,IPPOLITO.,Though Ovid somewhere says that Rome is worthy
53039,IPPOLITO.,"To be the dwelling-place of all the Gods,"
53040,IPPOLITO.,I must be gone from here.  To-morrow morning
53041,IPPOLITO.,"I start for Itri, and go thence by sea"
53042,IPPOLITO.,"To join the Emperor, who is making war"
53043,IPPOLITO.,Upon the Algerines; perhaps to sink
53044,IPPOLITO.,"Some Turkish galleys, and bring back in chains"

53061,IPPOLITO.,"It sounds so like a verse of the Aeneid,--"
53062,IPPOLITO.,"Has brought me eels fresh from the Lake of Fondi,"
53063,IPPOLITO.,And Lucrine oysters cradled in their shells:
53064,IPPOLITO.,"These, with red Fondi wine, the Caecu ban"

53066,IPPOLITO.,"Kept safe, until the heir of Posthumus"

53157,JULIA.,JULIA.
53158,JULIA.,I comprehend you.
53159,JULIA.,You think I am too worldly; that my head

53161,JULIA.,Is that your meaning?
53162,JULIA.,
53163,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53164,VALDESSO.,Yes; your meditations
53165,VALDESSO.,Are more of this world and its vanities

53167,VALDESSO.,
53168,JULIA.,JULIA.
53169,JULIA.,Between the two

53173,VALDESSO.,Yet have I seen you listen

53192,JULIA.,In part I do so; for to put a stop
53193,JULIA.,"To idle tongues, what men might say of me"
53194,JULIA.,"If I lived all alone here in my palace,"

53196,JULIA.,"For the monastic life, I now am living"
53197,JULIA.,With Sister Caterina at the convent
53198,JULIA.,"Of Santa Chiara, and I come here only"
53199,JULIA.,"On certain days, for my affairs, or visits"

53201,JULIA.,"For I confess, to live among my friends"
53202,JULIA.,Is Paradise to me; my Purgatory

53204,JULIA.,"And so I pass my life in these two worlds,"
53205,JULIA.,This palace and the convent.
53206,JULIA.,
53207,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53208,VALDESSO.,It was then
53209,VALDESSO.,"The fear of man, and not the love of God,"

53212,VALDESSO.,
53213,JULIA.,JULIA.
53214,JULIA.,"If God commands it,"

53218,JULIA.,"This jewel from my hand, this gown I wear,"
53219,JULIA.,Or aught else that is mine?
53220,JULIA.,
53221,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53222,VALDESSO.,The hindrance lies

53225,JULIA.,JULIA.
53226,JULIA.,"Ah me, I cannot bring my troubled mind"
53227,JULIA.,"To wish well to that Adam, our first parent,"
53228,JULIA.,"Who by his sin lost Paradise for us,"
53229,JULIA.,And brought such ills upon us.
53230,JULIA.,
53231,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53232,VALDESSO.,"We ourselves,"
53233,VALDESSO.,"When we commit a sin, lose Paradise,"
53234,VALDESSO.,"As much as he did.  Let us think of this,"
53235,VALDESSO.,And how we may regain it.
53236,VALDESSO.,
53237,JULIA.,JULIA.
53238,JULIA.,"Teach me, then,"

53242,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53243,VALDESSO.,"That is a task impossible, until"
53244,VALDESSO.,You tune your heart-strings to a higher key

53247,JULIA.,JULIA.
53248,JULIA.,How shall I do it?
53249,JULIA.,"Point out to me the way of this perfection,"
53250,JULIA.,And I will follow you; for you have made
53251,JULIA.,"My soul enamored with it, and I cannot"
53252,JULIA.,Rest satisfied until I find it out.
53253,JULIA.,"But lead me privately, so that the world"
53254,JULIA.,Hear not my steps; I would not give occasion
53255,JULIA.,For talk among the people.
53256,JULIA.,
53257,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53258,VALDESSO.,Now at last

53266,JULIA.,
53267,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53268,VALDESSO.,Because I rather wait for you to ask it

53270,VALDESSO.,
53271,JULIA.,JULIA.
53272,JULIA.,"Do me the kindness, then,"
53273,JULIA.,"To speak without reserve; and with all frankness,"

53276,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53277,VALDESSO.,I am content.

53286,VALDESSO.,Point out some royal road and lady-like
53287,VALDESSO.,"Which you may walk in, and not wound your feet;"
53288,VALDESSO.,"You would attain to the divine perfection,"
53289,VALDESSO.,And yet not turn your back upon the world;
53290,VALDESSO.,"You would possess humility within,"
53291,VALDESSO.,But not reveal it in your outward actions;
53292,VALDESSO.,"You would have patience, but without the rude"
53293,VALDESSO.,Occasions that require its exercise;
53294,VALDESSO.,"You would despise the world, but in such fashion"
53295,VALDESSO.,The world should not despise you in return;
53296,VALDESSO.,"Would clothe the soul with all the Christian graces,"
53297,VALDESSO.,Yet not despoil the body of its gauds;
53298,VALDESSO.,"Would feed the soul with spiritual food,"
53299,VALDESSO.,Yet not deprive the body of its feasts;
53300,VALDESSO.,"Would seem angelic in the sight of God,"
53301,VALDESSO.,Yet not too saint-like in the eyes of men;
53302,VALDESSO.,"In short, would lead a holy Christian life"
53303,VALDESSO.,In such a way that even your nearest friend
53304,VALDESSO.,Would not detect therein one circumstance
53305,VALDESSO.,To show a change from what it was before.
53306,VALDESSO.,Have I divined your secret?
53307,VALDESSO.,
53308,JULIA.,JULIA.
53309,JULIA.,You have drawn
53310,JULIA.,The portrait of my inner self as truly

53313,JULIA.,
53314,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53315,VALDESSO.,This warrants me in saying
53316,VALDESSO.,"You think you can win heaven by compromise,"

53318,VALDESSO.,
53319,JULIA,JULIA
53320,JULIA,You have often told me

53324,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53325,VALDESSO.,"Yes, in suits at law;"

53331,JULIA.,"Hush, dear Valdesso;"

53344,JULIA.,You have occasion now to show that virtue
53345,JULIA.,Which you lay stress upon.  Let us return

53376,VALDESSO.,VALDESSO.
53377,VALDESSO.,Pardon me; the portrait

53382,JULIA.,That is the same question

53384,JULIA.,I make you the same answer.  That was not
53385,JULIA.,"A pledge of love, but of pure gratitude."
53386,JULIA.,Recall the adventure of that dreadful night
53387,JULIA.,When Barbarossa with two thousand Moors
53388,JULIA.,"Landed upon the coast, and in the darkness"
53389,JULIA.,"Attacked my castle.  Then, without delay,"
53390,JULIA.,The Cardinal came hurrying down from Rome
53391,JULIA.,To rescue and protect me.  Was it wrong
53392,JULIA.,That in an hour like that I did not weigh
53393,JULIA.,"Too nicely this or that, but granted him"

53448,VITTORIA.,A memory of the far-off happy days
53449,VITTORIA.,When we were young.  When did you come from Fondi?
53450,VITTORIA.,
53451,JULIA.,JULIA.
53452,JULIA.,I have not been at Fondi since--
53453,JULIA.,
53454,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53455,VITTORIA.,Ah me!
53456,VITTORIA.,You need not speak the word; I understand you.
53457,VITTORIA.,
53458,JULIA.,JULIA.
53459,JULIA.,I came from Naples by the lovely valley
53460,JULIA.,The Terra di Lavoro.
53461,JULIA.,
53462,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53463,VITTORIA.,And you find me
53464,VITTORIA.,But just returned from a long journey northward.
53465,VITTORIA.,I have been staying with that noble woman
53466,VITTORIA.,"Renee of France, the Duchess of Ferrara."
53467,VITTORIA.,
53468,JULIA.,JULIA.
53469,JULIA.,"Oh, tell me of the Duchess.  I have heard"
53470,JULIA.,Flaminio speak her praises with such warmth
53471,JULIA.,That I am eager to hear more of her
53472,JULIA.,And of her brilliant court.
53473,JULIA.,
53474,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53475,VITTORIA.,You shall hear all
53476,VITTORIA.,But first sit down and listen patiently
53477,VITTORIA.,While I confess myself.
53478,VITTORIA.,
53479,JULIA.,JULIA.
53480,JULIA.,What deadly sin
53481,JULIA.,Have you committed?
53482,JULIA.,
53483,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53484,VITTORIA.,Not a sin; a folly
53485,VITTORIA.,"I chid you once at Ischia, when you told me"
53486,VITTORIA.,That brave Fra Bastian was to paint your portrait.
53487,VITTORIA.,
53488,JULIA,JULIA
53489,JULIA,Well I remember it.
53490,JULIA,
53491,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53492,VITTORIA.,"Then chide me now,"
53493,VITTORIA.,For I confess to something still more strange.
53494,VITTORIA.,"Old as I am, I have at last consented"
53495,VITTORIA.,To the entreaties and the supplications
53496,VITTORIA.,Of Michael Angelo--
53497,VITTORIA.,
53498,JULIA,JULIA
53499,JULIA,To marry him?
53500,JULIA,
53501,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53502,VITTORIA.,"I pray you, do not jest with me!  You now,"
53503,VITTORIA.,"Or you should know, that never such a thought"
53504,VITTORIA.,Entered my breast.  I am already married.
53505,VITTORIA.,"The Marquis of Pescara is my husband,"
53506,VITTORIA.,And death has not divorced us.
53507,VITTORIA.,
53508,JULIA.,JULIA.
53509,JULIA.,Pardon me.
53510,JULIA.,Have I offended you?
53511,JULIA.,
53512,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53513,VITTORIA.,"No, but have hurt me."
53514,VITTORIA.,"Unto my buried lord I give myself,"
53515,VITTORIA.,"Unto my friend the shadow of myself,"
53516,VITTORIA.,"My portrait.  It is not from vanity,"
53517,VITTORIA.,But for the love I bear him.
53518,VITTORIA.,
53519,JULIA.,JULIA.
53520,JULIA.,I rejoice
53521,JULIA.,"To hear these words.  Oh, this will be a portrait"
53522,JULIA.,Worthy of both of you!     [A knock.
53523,JULIA.,
53524,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53525,VITTORIA.,Hark! He is coming.
53526,VITTORIA.,
53527,JULIA.,JULIA.
53528,JULIA.,And shall I go or stay?
53529,JULIA.,
53530,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53531,VITTORIA.,"By all means, stay."
53532,VITTORIA.,The drawing will be better for your presence;
53533,VITTORIA.,You will enliven me.
53534,VITTORIA.,
53535,JULIA.,JULIA.
53536,JULIA.,I shall not speak;
53537,JULIA.,The presence of great men doth take from me
53538,JULIA.,All power of speech.  I only gaze at them
53539,JULIA.,"In silent wonder, as if they were gods,"
53540,JULIA.,Or the inhabitants of some other planet.
53541,JULIA.,
53542,JULIA.,Enter MICHAEL ANGELO.
53543,JULIA.,
53544,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53545,VITTORIA.,Come in.
53546,VITTORIA.,
53547,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53548,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I fear my visit is ill-timed;
53549,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I interrupt you.
53550,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53551,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53552,VITTORIA.,No; this is a friend
53553,VITTORIA.,"Of yours as well as mine,--the Lady Julia,"
53554,VITTORIA.,The Duchess of Trajetto.
53555,VITTORIA.,
53556,VITTORIA.,MICHAEL ANGELO to JULIA.
53557,VITTORIA.,I salute you.
53558,VITTORIA.,"'T is long since I have seen your face, my lady;"
53559,VITTORIA.,"Pardon me if I say that having seen it,"
53560,VITTORIA.,One never can forget it.
53561,VITTORIA.,
53562,JULIA.,JULIA.
53563,JULIA.,You are kind
53564,JULIA.,To keep me in your memory.
53565,JULIA.,
53566,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53567,MICHAEL ANGELO.,It is
53568,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The privilege of age to speak with frankness.
53569,MICHAEL ANGELO.,You will not be offended when I say
53570,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That never was your beauty more divine.
53571,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53572,JULIA.,JULIA.
53573,JULIA.,When Michael Angelo condescends to flatter
53574,JULIA.,"Or praise me, I am proud, and not offended."
53575,JULIA.,
53576,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53577,VITTORIA.,Now this is gallantry enough for one;
53578,VITTORIA.,Show me a little.
53579,VITTORIA.,
53580,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53581,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Ah, my gracious lady,"
53582,MICHAEL ANGELO.,You know I have not words to speak your praise.
53583,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I think of you in silence.  You conceal
53584,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Your manifold perfections from all eyes,"
53585,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And make yourself more saint-like day by day.
53586,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And day by day men worship you the wore.
53587,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But now your hour of martyrdom has come.
53588,MICHAEL ANGELO.,You know why I am here.
53589,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53590,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53591,VITTORIA.,"Ah yes, I know it,"
53592,VITTORIA.,And meet my fate with fortitude.  You find me
53593,VITTORIA.,Surrounded by the labors of your hands:
53594,VITTORIA.,"The Woman of Samaria at the Well,"
53595,VITTORIA.,"The Mater Dolorosa, and the Christ"
53596,VITTORIA.,"Upon the Cross, beneath which you have written"
53597,VITTORIA.,"Those memorable words of Alighieri,"
53598,VITTORIA.,"""Men have forgotten how much blood it costs."""
53599,VITTORIA.,
53600,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53601,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And now I come to add one labor more,"
53602,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"If you will call that labor which is pleasure,"
53603,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And only pleasure.
53604,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53605,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53606,VITTORIA.,How shall I be seated?
53607,VITTORIA.,
53608,VITTORIA.,"MICHAEL ANGELO, opening his portfolio."
53609,VITTORIA.,
53610,VITTORIA.,Just as you are.  The light falls well upon you.
53611,VITTORIA.,
53612,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53613,VITTORIA.,I am ashamed to steal the time from you
53614,VITTORIA.,That should be given to the Sistine Chapel.
53615,VITTORIA.,How does that work go on?
53616,VITTORIA.,
53617,VITTORIA.,"MICHAEL ANGELO, drawing."
53618,VITTORIA.,But tardily.
53619,VITTORIA.,Old men work slowly.  Brain and hand alike
53620,VITTORIA.,"Are dull and torpid.  To die young is best,"
53621,VITTORIA.,And not to be remembered as old men
53622,VITTORIA.,Tottering about in their decrepitude.
53623,VITTORIA.,
53624,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53625,VITTORIA.,"My dear Maestro! have you, then, forgotten"
53626,VITTORIA.,The story of Sophocles in his old age?
53627,VITTORIA.,
53628,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53629,MICHAEL ANGELO.,What story is it?
53630,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53631,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53632,VITTORIA.,"When his sons accused him,"
53633,VITTORIA.,"Before the Areopagus, of dotage,"
53634,VITTORIA.,"For all defence, he read there to his Judges"
53635,VITTORIA.,"The Tragedy of Oedipus Coloneus,--"
53636,VITTORIA.,The work of his old age.
53637,VITTORIA.,
53638,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53639,MICHAEL ANGELO.,'T is an illusion
53640,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A fabulous story, that will lead old men"
53641,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Into a thousand follies and conceits.
53642,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53643,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53644,VITTORIA.,So you may show to cavilers your painting
53645,VITTORIA.,Of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel.
53646,VITTORIA.,
53647,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53648,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Now you and Lady Julia shall resume
53649,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The conversation that I interrupted.
53650,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53651,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53652,VITTORIA.,It was of no great import; nothing more
53653,VITTORIA.,"Nor less than my late visit to Ferrara,"
53654,VITTORIA.,And what I saw there in the ducal palace.
53655,VITTORIA.,Will it not interrupt you?
53656,VITTORIA.,
53657,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53658,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Not the least.
53659,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53660,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53661,VITTORIA.,"Well, first, then, of Duke Ercole: a man"
53662,VITTORIA.,"Cold in his manners, and reserved and silent,"
53663,VITTORIA.,And yet magnificent in all his ways;
53664,VITTORIA.,"Not hospitable unto new ideas,"
53665,VITTORIA.,"But from state policy, and certain reasons"
53666,VITTORIA.,"Concerning the investiture of the duchy,"
53667,VITTORIA.,"A partisan of Rome, and consequently"
53668,VITTORIA.,Intolerant of all the new opinions.
53669,VITTORIA.,
53670,JULIA.,JULIA.
53671,JULIA.,"I should not like the Duke.  These silent men,"
53672,JULIA.,"Who only look and listen, are like wells"
53673,JULIA.,"That have no water in them, deep and empty."
53674,JULIA.,How could the daughter of a king of France
53675,JULIA.,Wed such a duke?
53676,JULIA.,
53677,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53678,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The men that women marry
53679,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And why they marry them, will always be"
53680,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A marvel and a mystery to the world.
53681,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53682,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53683,VITTORIA.,"And then the Duchess,--how shall I describe her,"
53684,VITTORIA.,"Or tell the merits of that happy nature,"
53685,VITTORIA.,Which pleases most when least it thinks of pleasing?
53686,VITTORIA.,"Not beautiful, perhaps, in form and feature,"
53687,VITTORIA.,"Yet with an inward beauty, that shines through"
53688,VITTORIA.,Each look and attitude and word and gesture;
53689,VITTORIA.,"A kindly grace of manner and behavior,"
53690,VITTORIA.,A something in her presence and her ways
53691,VITTORIA.,That makes her beautiful beyond the reach
53692,VITTORIA.,Of mere external beauty; and in heart
53693,VITTORIA.,"So noble and devoted to the truth,"
53694,VITTORIA.,And so in sympathy with all who strive
53695,VITTORIA.,After the higher life.
53696,VITTORIA.,
53697,JULIA.,JULIA.
53698,JULIA.,She draws me to her
53699,JULIA.,As much as her Duke Ercole repels me.
53700,JULIA.,
53701,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53702,VITTORIA.,Then the devout and honorable women
53703,VITTORIA.,"That grace her court, and make it good to be there;"
53704,VITTORIA.,"Francesca Bucyronia, the true-hearted,"
53705,VITTORIA.,"Lavinia della Rovere and the Orsini,"
53706,VITTORIA.,"The Magdalena and the Cherubina,"
53707,VITTORIA.,"And Anne de Parthenai, who sings so sweetly;"
53708,VITTORIA.,"All lovely women, full of noble thoughts"
53709,VITTORIA.,And aspirations after noble things.
53710,VITTORIA.,
53711,JULIA.,JULIA.
53712,JULIA.,Boccaccio would have envied you such dames.
53713,JULIA.,
53714,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53715,VITTORIA.,No; his Fiammettas and his Philomenas
53716,VITTORIA.,Are fitter company for Ser Giovanni;
53717,VITTORIA.,I fear he hardly would have comprehended
53718,VITTORIA.,The women that I speak of.
53719,VITTORIA.,
53720,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53721,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Yet he wrote
53722,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The story of Griselda.  That is something
53723,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To set down in his favor.
53724,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53725,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53726,VITTORIA.,With these ladies
53727,VITTORIA.,"Was a young girl, Olympia Morate,"
53728,VITTORIA.,"Daughter of Fulvio, the learned scholar,"
53729,VITTORIA.,Famous in all the universities.
53730,VITTORIA.,"A marvellous child, who at the spinning wheel,"
53731,VITTORIA.,"And in the daily round of household cares,"
53732,VITTORIA.,Hath learned both Greek and Latin; and is now
53733,VITTORIA.,A favorite of the Duchess and companion
53734,VITTORIA.,Of Princess Anne.  This beautiful young Sappho
53735,VITTORIA.,Sometimes recited to us Grecian odes
53736,VITTORIA.,"That she had written, with a voice whose sadness"
53737,VITTORIA.,"Thrilled and o'ermastered me, and made me look"
53738,VITTORIA.,"Into the future time, and ask myself"
53739,VITTORIA.,What destiny will be hers.
53740,VITTORIA.,
53741,JULIA.,JULIA.
53742,JULIA.,"A sad one, surely."
53743,JULIA.,Frost kills the flowers that blossom out of season;
53744,JULIA.,And these precocious intellects portend
53745,JULIA.,A life of sorrow or an early death.
53746,JULIA.,
53747,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53748,VITTORIA.,About the court were many learned men;
53749,VITTORIA.,"Chilian Sinapius from beyond the Alps,"
53750,VITTORIA.,"And Celio Curione, and Manzolli,"
53751,VITTORIA.,"The Duke's physician; and a pale young man,"
53752,VITTORIA.,"Charles d'Espeville of Geneva, whom the Duchess"
53753,VITTORIA.,"Doth much delight to talk with and to read,"
53754,VITTORIA.,For he hath written a book of Institutes
53755,VITTORIA.,"The Duchess greatly praises, though some call it"
53756,VITTORIA.,The Koran of the heretics.
53757,VITTORIA.,
53758,JULIA.,JULIA.
53759,JULIA.,And what poets
53760,JULIA.,"Were there to sing you madrigals, and praise"
53761,JULIA.,Olympia's eyes and Cherubina's tresses?
53762,JULIA.,
53763,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53764,VITTORIA.,No; for great Ariosto is no more.
53765,VITTORIA.,The voice that filled those halls with melody
53766,VITTORIA.,Has long been hushed in death.
53767,VITTORIA.,
53768,JULIA.,JULIA.
53769,JULIA.,You should have made
53770,JULIA.,"A pilgrimage unto the poet's tomb,"
53771,JULIA.,"And laid a wreath upon it, for the words"
53772,JULIA.,He spake of you.
53773,JULIA.,
53774,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53775,VITTORIA.,"And of yourself no less,"
53776,VITTORIA.,"And of our master, Michael Angelo."
53777,VITTORIA.,
53778,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53779,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of me?
53780,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53781,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53782,VITTORIA.,Have you forgotten that he calls you
53783,VITTORIA.,"Michael, less man than angel, and divine?"
53784,VITTORIA.,You are ungrateful.
53785,VITTORIA.,
53786,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53787,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A mere play on words.
53788,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That adjective he wanted for a rhyme,"
53789,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To match with Gian Bellino and Urbino.
53790,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53791,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53792,VITTORIA.,"Bernardo Tasso is no longer there,"
53793,VITTORIA.,"Nor the gay troubadour of Gascony,"
53794,VITTORIA.,"Clement Marot, surnamed by flatterers"
53795,VITTORIA.,"The Prince of Poets and the Poet of Princes,"
53796,VITTORIA.,"Who, being looked upon with much disfavor"
53797,VITTORIA.,"By the Duke Ercole, has fled to Venice."
53798,VITTORIA.,
53799,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53800,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"There let him stay with Pietro Aretino,"
53801,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The Scourge of Princes, also called Divine."
53802,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The title is so common in our mouths,"
53803,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That even the Pifferari of Abruzzi,"
53804,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Who play their bag-pipes in the streets of Rome
53805,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"At the Epiphany, will bear it soon,"
53806,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And will deserve it better than some poets.
53807,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53808,VITTORIA.,VITTORIA.
53809,VITTORIA.,What bee hath stung you?
53810,VITTORIA.,
53811,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
53812,MICHAEL ANGELO.,One that makes no honey;
53813,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"One that comes buzzing in through every window,"
53814,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And stabs men with his sting.  A bitter thought
53815,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Passed through my mind, but it is gone again;"
53816,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I spake too hastily.
53817,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53818,JULIA.,JULIA.
53819,JULIA.,"I pray you, show me"
53820,JULIA.,What you have done.

53839,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Held the Pope's stirrup, as his Holiness"
53840,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Alighted from his mule!  A fugitive
53841,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"From Cardinal Caraffa's hate, who hurls"
53842,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"His thunders at the house of the Colonna,"
53843,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With endless bitterness!--Among the nuns

53846,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"For my too frequent letters, that disturb"
53847,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Her meditations, and that hinder me"
53848,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And keep me from my work; now graciously
53849,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"She thanks me for the crucifix I sent her,"
53850,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And says that she will keep it: with one hand
53851,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Inflicts a wound, and with the other heals it."

53858,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Nor more could be desired, or even so much."

53865,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To this sweet Christ for you, and to beseech you"
53866,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To hold me altogether yours in all things."""
53867,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53868,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Well, I will write less often, or no more,"
53869,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But wait her coming.  No one born in Rome
53870,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Can live elsewhere; but he must pine for Rome,"

53876,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Because I breathe in Rome an atmosphere
53877,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Heavy with odors of the laurel leaves
53878,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That crowned great heroes of the sword and pen,"
53879,MICHAEL ANGELO.,In ages past.  I feel myself exalted
53880,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To walk the streets in which a Virgil walked,"
53881,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Or Trajan rode in triumph; but far more,"
53882,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And most of all, because the great Colonna"
53883,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Breathes the same air I breathe, and is to me"
53884,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"An inspiration.  Now that she is gone,"
53885,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Rome is no longer Rome till she return.
53886,MICHAEL ANGELO.,This feeling overmasters me.  I know not
53887,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"If it be love, this strong desire to be"
53888,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Forever in her presence; but I know
53889,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That I, who was the friend of solitude,"
53890,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And ever was best pleased when most alone,"
53891,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Now weary grow of my own company.
53892,MICHAEL ANGELO.,For the first time old age seems lonely to me.
53893,MICHAEL ANGELO.,[Opening the Divina Commedia.
53894,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I turn for consolation to the leaves
53895,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of the great master of our Tuscan tongue,"
53896,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Whose words, like colored garnet-shirls in lava,"
53897,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Betray the heat in which they were engendered.
53898,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A mendicant, he ate the bitter bread"
53899,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of others, but repaid their meagre gifts"
53900,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With immortality.  In courts of princes
53901,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"He was a by-word, and in streets of towns"
53902,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Was mocked by children, like the Hebrew prophet,"
53903,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Himself a prophet.  I too know the cry,"
53904,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Go up, thou bald head! from a generation"
53905,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That, wanting reverence, wanteth the best food"
53906,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The soul can feed on.  There's not room enough
53907,MICHAEL ANGELO.,For age and youth upon this little planet.
53908,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Age must give way.  There was not room enough
53909,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Even for this great poet.  In his song
53910,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I hear reverberate the gates of Florence,"
53911,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Closing upon him, never more to open;"
53912,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But mingled with the sound are melodies
53913,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Celestial from the gates of paradise.
53914,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"He came, and he is gone.  The people knew not"
53915,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"What manner of man was passing by their doors,"
53916,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Until he passed no more; but in his vision
53917,MICHAEL ANGELO.,He saw the torments and beatitudes
53918,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of souls condemned or pardoned, and hath left"
53919,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Behind him this sublime Apocalypse.
53920,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
53921,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I strive in vain to draw here on the margin
53922,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The face of Beatrice.  It is not hers,"
53923,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But the Colonna's.  Each hath his ideal,"
53924,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The image of some woman excellent,"
53925,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That is his guide.  No Grecian art, nor Roman,"
53926,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Hath yet revealed such loveliness as hers.

53966,VITTORIA.,Have patience; I will come to thee at last.
53967,VITTORIA.,"A few more goings in and out these doors,"

54006,BENVENUTO.,I come to take my leave.  I start for Florence

54015,MICHAEL ANGELO.,How damp and cold it was!  How my bones ached
54016,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And my head reeled, when I was working there!"
54017,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I am too old.  I will stay here in Rome,"
54018,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Where all is old and crumbling, like myself,"

54035,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The fever to accomplish some great work

54043,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Yes; whenever
54044,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I think of anything beside my work,"
54045,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I think of Florence.  I remember, too,"
54046,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The bitter days I passed among the quarries
54047,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of Seravezza and Pietrasanta;
54048,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Road-building in the marshes; stupid people,"
54049,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And cold and rain incessant, and mad gusts"
54050,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of mountain wind, like howling dervishes,"
54051,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That spun and whirled the eddying snow about them
54052,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"As if it were a garment; aye, vexations"
54053,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And troubles of all kinds, that ended only"
54054,MICHAEL ANGELO.,In loss of time and money.

54057,BENVENUTO.,"True; Maestro,"

54065,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I see the marvellous dome of Brunelleschi,"

54067,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And Ghirlandajo's lovely Benci glides
54068,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With folded hands amid my troubled thoughts,"
54069,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A splendid vision!  Time rides with the old
54070,MICHAEL ANGELO.,At a great pace.  As travellers on swift steeds
54071,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"See the near landscape fly and flow behind them,"
54072,MICHAEL ANGELO.,While the remoter fields and dim horizons
54073,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Go with them, and seem wheeling round to meet them,"
54074,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"So in old age things near us slip away,"
54075,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And distant things go with as.  Pleasantly
54076,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Come back to me the days when, as a youth,"
54077,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I walked with Ghirlandajo in the gardens
54078,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of Medici, and saw the antique statues,"
54079,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The forms august of gods and godlike men,"
54080,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And the great world of art revealed itself
54081,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To my young eyes.  Then all that man hath done

54091,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54092,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The work is nearly done.  But this Last Judgment
54093,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Has been the cause of more vexation to me
54094,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Than it will be of honor.  Ser Biagio,"
54095,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Master of ceremonies at the Papal court,"
54096,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A man punctilious and over nice,"
54097,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Calls it improper; says that those nude forms,"
54098,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Showing their nakedness in such shameless fashion,"
54099,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Are better suited to a common bagnio,"
54100,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Or wayside wine-shop, than a Papal Chapel."
54101,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To punish him I painted him as Minos
54102,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And leave him there as master of ceremonies
54103,MICHAEL ANGELO.,In the Infernal Regions.  What would you
54104,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Have done to such a man?
54105,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54106,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
54107,BENVENUTO.,I would have killed him.
54108,BENVENUTO.,"When any one insults me, if I can"

54111,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54112,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Oh, you gentlemen,"
54113,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Who dress in silks and velvets, and wear swords,"

54115,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A taste for homicide.
54116,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54117,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
54118,BENVENUTO.,I learned that lesson
54119,BENVENUTO.,"Under Pope Clement at the siege of Rome,"
54120,BENVENUTO.,Some twenty years ago.  As I was standing
54121,BENVENUTO.,Upon the ramparts of the Campo Santo
54122,BENVENUTO.,"With Alessandro Bene, I beheld"
54123,BENVENUTO.,"A sea of fog, that covered all the plain,"
54124,BENVENUTO.,"And hid from us the foe; when suddenly,"
54125,BENVENUTO.,"A misty figure, like an apparition,"
54126,BENVENUTO.,"Rose up above the fog, as if on horseback."
54127,BENVENUTO.,"At this I aimed my arquebus, and fired."
54128,BENVENUTO.,The figure vanished; and there rose a cry
54129,BENVENUTO.,"Out of the darkness, long and fierce and loud,"
54130,BENVENUTO.,With imprecations in all languages.
54131,BENVENUTO.,"It was the Constable of France, the Bourbon,"
54132,BENVENUTO.,That I had slain.

54134,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54135,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Rome should be grateful to you.

54138,BENVENUTO.,But has not been; you shall hear presently.
54139,BENVENUTO.,"During the siege I served as bombardier,"
54140,BENVENUTO.,"There in St. Angelo.  His Holiness,"
54141,BENVENUTO.,"One day, was walking with his Cardinals"
54142,BENVENUTO.,"On the round bastion, while I stood above"
54143,BENVENUTO.,"Among my falconets.  All thought and feeling,"
54144,BENVENUTO.,"All skill in art and all desire of fame,"
54145,BENVENUTO.,Were swallowed up in the delightful music
54146,BENVENUTO.,"Of that artillery.  I saw far off,"
54147,BENVENUTO.,"Within the enemy's trenches on the Prati,"
54148,BENVENUTO.,A Spanish cavalier in scarlet cloak;
54149,BENVENUTO.,"And firing at him with due aim and range,"
54150,BENVENUTO.,I cut the gay Hidalgo in two pieces.
54151,BENVENUTO.,The eyes are dry that wept for him in Spain.
54152,BENVENUTO.,"His Holiness, delighted beyond measure"
54153,BENVENUTO.,"With such display of gunnery, and amazed"
54154,BENVENUTO.,"To see the man in scarlet cut in two,"
54155,BENVENUTO.,"Gave me his benediction, and absolved me"
54156,BENVENUTO.,From all the homicides I had committed
54157,BENVENUTO.,"In service of the Apostolic Church,"
54158,BENVENUTO.,Or should commit thereafter.  From that day
54159,BENVENUTO.,I have not held in very high esteem
54160,BENVENUTO.,The life of man.
54161,BENVENUTO.,
54162,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54163,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And who absolved Pope Clement?

54173,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54174,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
54175,BENVENUTO.,"Faith, a pretty artist"

54178,BENVENUTO.,
54179,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54180,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"He has grown fat and lazy,"
54181,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As if the lead clung to him like a sinker.
54182,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"He paints no more, since he was sent to Fondi"
54183,MICHAEL ANGELO.,By Cardinal Ippolito to paint
54184,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The fair Gonzaga.  Ah, you should have seen him"
54185,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"As I did, riding through the city gate,"
54186,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In his brown hood, attended by four horsemen,"
54187,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Completely armed, to frighten the banditti."
54188,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I think he would have frightened them alone,"
54189,MICHAEL ANGELO.,For he was rounder than the O of Giotto.
54190,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54191,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
54192,BENVENUTO.,He must have looked more like a sack of meal

54211,BENVENUTO.,"This gold ring,"
54212,BENVENUTO.,"Made for his Holiness,--my latest work,"
54213,BENVENUTO.,And I am proud of it.  A single diamond
54214,BENVENUTO.,Presented by the Emperor to the Pope.
54215,BENVENUTO.,Targhetta of Venice set and tinted it;
54216,BENVENUTO.,"I have reset it, and retinted it"
54217,BENVENUTO.,"Divinely, as you see.  The jewellers"

54224,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
54225,BENVENUTO.,That is not the expression.

54231,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54232,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Messer Benvenuto,"
54233,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I lose all patience with you; for the gifts
54234,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That God hath given you are of such a kind,"
54235,MICHAEL ANGELO.,They should be put to far more noble uses
54236,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Than setting diamonds for the Pope of Rome.
54237,MICHAEL ANGELO.,You can do greater things.

54239,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
54240,BENVENUTO.,The God who made me

54243,BENVENUTO.,
54244,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54245,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Oh no; an artist

54251,BENVENUTO.,Michael Angelo

54253,BENVENUTO.,From any other man.  He speaks the truth.
54254,BENVENUTO.,I know my life is wasted and consumed
54255,BENVENUTO.,In vanities; but I have better hours
54256,BENVENUTO.,And higher aspirations than you think.
54257,BENVENUTO.,"Once, when a prisoner at St. Angelo,"
54258,BENVENUTO.,"Fasting and praying in the midnight darkness,"
54259,BENVENUTO.,In a celestial vision I beheld
54260,BENVENUTO.,"A crucifix in the sun, of the same substance"
54261,BENVENUTO.,As is the sun itself.  And since that hour
54262,BENVENUTO.,"There is a splendor round about my head,"
54263,BENVENUTO.,That may be seen at sunrise and at sunset
54264,BENVENUTO.,Above my shadow on the grass.  And now
54265,BENVENUTO.,"I know that I am in the grace of God,"
54266,BENVENUTO.,And none henceforth can harm me.

54279,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"At least, forget not the celestial vision."

54286,BENVENUTO.,"The Lilies that illumine heaven and earth,"
54287,BENVENUTO.,And carry in mine equipage the model
54288,BENVENUTO.,Of a most marvellous golden salt-cellar
54289,BENVENUTO.,For the king's table; and here in my brain
54290,BENVENUTO.,A statue of Mars Armipotent for the fountain
54291,BENVENUTO.,"Of Fontainebleau, colossal, wonderful."
54292,BENVENUTO.,"I go a goldsmith, to return a sculptor."
54293,BENVENUTO.,"And so farewell, great Master.  Think of me"
54294,BENVENUTO.,"As one who, in the midst of all his follies,"

54330,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Ah, my Bastiano,"
54331,MICHAEL ANGELO.,If you went up and down as many stairs
54332,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"As I do still, and climbed as many ladders,"
54333,MICHAEL ANGELO.,It would be better for you.  Pray sit down.
54334,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Your idle and luxurious way of living
54335,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Will one day take your breath away entirely.

54337,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54338,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54339,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Well, what then?"
54340,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"That would be better, in my apprehension,"
54341,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Than falling from a scaffold.
54342,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54343,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54344,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That was nothing
54345,MICHAEL ANGELO.,It did not kill me; only lamed me slightly;

54349,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"But why, dear Master,"
54350,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Why do you live so high up in your house,"

54354,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54355,MICHAEL ANGELO.,From this window I can look
54356,MICHAEL ANGELO.,On many gardens; o'er the city roofs

54359,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54360,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54361,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Can you sit down in them,"

54379,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54380,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"It is his nature,--"
54381,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A restless spirit, that consumes itself"

54383,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The goal he aims at.  Patience is a plant
54384,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That grows not in all gardens.  You are made
54385,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of quite another clay.
54386,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54387,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.

54389,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"And now, being somewhat rested, I will tell you"

54400,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54401,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54402,FRA SEBASTIANO.,I will not excuse you.
54403,FRA SEBASTIANO.,You need repose from your incessant work;
54404,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Some recreation, some bright hours of pleasure."
54405,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54406,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54407,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"To me, what you and other men call pleasure"
54408,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Is only pain.  Work is my recreation,"
54409,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The play of faculty; a delight like that
54410,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Which a bird feels in flying, or a fish"
54411,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In darting through the water,--nothing more."
54412,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I cannot go.  The Sibylline leaves of life
54413,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Grow precious now, when only few remain."

54416,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54417,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Berni, perhaps, will read"

54421,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That is another reason for not going.
54422,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"If aught is tedious and intolerable,"
54423,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"It is a poet reading his own verses,"
54424,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54425,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54426,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Berni thinks somewhat better of your verses
54427,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Than you of his.  He says that you speak things,"

54429,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54430,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.

54432,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Luigia Pulci, whom I used to hear"
54433,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With Benvenuto, in the streets of Florence,"
54434,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I might be tempted.  I was younger then

54437,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54438,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"There is a Frenchman here, named Rabelais,"

54440,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And secretary to the embassy:
54441,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"A learned man, who speaks all languages,"
54442,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And wittiest of men; who wrote a book
54443,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Of the Adventures of Gargantua,"
54444,FRA SEBASTIANO.,So full of strange conceits one roars with laughter
54445,FRA SEBASTIANO.,At every page; a jovial boon-companion

54448,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54449,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Then you will not want me, who am not witty,"

54451,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I should be like a dead man at your banquet.
54452,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Why should I seek this Frenchman, Rabelais?"
54453,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And wherefore go to hear Francesco Berni,"
54454,MICHAEL ANGELO.,When I have Dante Alighieri here.
54455,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The greatest of all poets?
54456,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54457,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54458,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And the dullest;
54459,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And only to be read in episodes.
54460,FRA SEBASTIANO.,His day is past.  Petrarca is our poet.
54461,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54462,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54463,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Petrarca is for women and for lovers

54466,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Tinkling their little sonnets all day long,"
54467,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As lap dogs do their bells.

54469,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54470,FRA SEBASTIANO.,I love Petrarca.
54471,FRA SEBASTIANO.,How sweetly of his absent love he sings
54472,FRA SEBASTIANO.,When journeying in the forest of Ardennes!
54473,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"""I seem to hear her, hearing the boughs and breezes"
54474,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"And leaves and birds lamenting, and the waters"

54476,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54477,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54478,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Enough.  It is all seeming, and no being."
54479,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"If you would know how a man speaks in earnest,"

54497,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54498,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54499,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Vituperation; gall that might have spirited

54502,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54503,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Name not that man!
54504,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A profligate, whom your Francesco Berni"
54505,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Describes as having one foot in the brothel
54506,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And the other in the hospital; who lives
54507,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"By flattering or maligning, as best serves"
54508,MICHAEL ANGELO.,His purpose at the time.  He writes to me
54509,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With easy arrogance of my Last Judgment,"
54510,MICHAEL ANGELO.,In such familiar tone that one would say
54511,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The great event already had occurred,"
54512,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And he was present, and from observation"
54513,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Informed me how the picture should be painted.

54515,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54516,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"What unassuming, unobtrusive men"

54518,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Aiming his shafts at you brings back to mind
54519,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"The Gascon archers in the square of Milan,"
54520,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Shooting their arrows at Duke Sforza's statue,"
54521,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"By Leonardo, and the foolish rabble"
54522,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Of envious Florentines, that at your David"

54524,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54525,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54526,MICHAEL ANGELO.,His praises were ironical.  He knows
54527,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"How to use words as weapons, and to wound"

54546,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54547,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And you like this picture.
54548,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And yet it is in oil; which you detest.
54549,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54550,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54551,MICHAEL ANGELO.,When that barbarian Jan Van Eyck discovered
54552,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The use of oil in painting, he degraded"
54553,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"His art into a handicraft, and made it"
54554,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Sign-painting, merely, for a country inn"
54555,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Or wayside wine-shop.  'T is an art for women,"
54556,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Or for such leisurely and idle people
54557,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"As you, Fra Bastiano.  Nature paints not"
54558,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In oils, but frescoes the great dome of heaven"
54559,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With sunset; and the lovely forms of clouds
54560,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And flying vapors.
54561,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54562,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54563,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And how soon they fade!
54564,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Behold yon line of roofs and belfries painted
54565,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Upon the golden background of the sky,"
54566,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Like a Byzantine picture, or a portrait"
54567,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Of Cimabue.  See how hard the outline,"
54568,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Sharp-cut and clear, not rounded into shadow."
54569,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Yet that is nature.
54570,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54571,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54572,MICHAEL ANGELO.,She is always right.
54573,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The picture that approaches sculpture nearest
54574,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Is the best picture.
54575,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54576,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54577,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Leonardo thinks
54578,FRA SEBASTIANO.,The open air too bright.  We ought to paint
54579,FRA SEBASTIANO.,As if the sun were shining through a mist.
54580,FRA SEBASTIANO.,'T is easier done in oil than in distemper.
54581,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54582,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54583,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Do not revive again the old dispute;
54584,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I have an excellent memory for forgetting,"

54587,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54588,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54589,FRA SEBASTIANO.,So  say Petrarca and the ancient proverb.

54595,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54596,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54597,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Why should I paint?  Why should I toil and sweat,"
54598,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Who now am rich enough to live at ease,"

54600,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54601,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54602,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"When Pope Leo died,"
54603,MICHAEL ANGELO.,He who had been so lavish of the wealth
54604,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"His predecessors left him, who received"
54605,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A basket of gold-pieces every morning,"
54606,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Which every night was empty, left behind"
54607,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Hardly enough to pay his funeral.

54609,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54610,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"I care for banquets, not for funerals,"
54611,FRA SEBASTIANO.,As did his Holiness.  I have forbidden
54612,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"All tapers at my burial, and procession"

54614,FRA SEBASTIANO.,The cost thereof be given to the poor!
54615,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54616,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54617,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"You have done wisely, but of that I speak not."
54618,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Ghiberti left behind him wealth and children;
54619,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But who to-day would know that he had lived,"
54620,MICHAEL ANGELO.,If he had never made those gates of bronze
54621,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In the old Baptistery,--those gates of bronze,"
54622,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Worthy to be the gates of Paradise.
54623,MICHAEL ANGELO.,His wealth is scattered to the winds; his children
54624,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Are long since dead; but those celestial gates
54625,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Survive, and keep his name and memory green."
54626,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54627,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54628,FRA SEBASTIANO.,But why should I fatigue myself?  I think
54629,FRA SEBASTIANO.,That all things it is possible to paint
54630,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Have been already painted; and if not,"
54631,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Why, there are painters in the world at present"
54632,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Who can accomplish more in two short months
54633,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Than I could in two years; so it is well
54634,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"That some one is contented to do nothing,"
54635,FRA SEBASTIANO.,And leave the field to others.
54636,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54637,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54638,MICHAEL ANGELO.,O blasphemer!
54639,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Not without reason do the people call you
54640,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Sebastian del Piombo, for the lead"
54641,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of all the Papal bulls is heavy upon you,"
54642,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And wraps you like a shroud.

54644,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54645,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Misericordia!
54646,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"Sharp is the vinegar of sweet wine, and sharp"
54647,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"The words you speak, because the heart within you"

54649,FRA SEBASTIANO.,
54650,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54651,MICHAEL ANGELO.,How changed you are
54652,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"From the Sebastiano I once knew,"
54653,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"When poor, laborious, emulous to excel,"
54654,MICHAEL ANGELO.,You strove in rivalry with Badassare

54656,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
54657,FRA SEBASTIANO.,FRA SEBASTIANO.
54658,FRA SEBASTIANO.,Raphael is dead;
54659,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"He is but dust and ashes in his grave,"
54660,FRA SEBASTIANO.,"While I am living and enjoying life,"

54664,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
54665,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Raphael is not dead;

54668,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"He only drank the precious wine of youth,"
54669,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The outbreak of the grapes, before the vintage"

55390,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Would be departing from the truth. San Gallo,"
55391,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Building about with columns, took all light"
55392,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Out of this plan; left in the choir dark corners

55920,BENVENUTO.,"But ah, what infinite trouble have I had"
55921,BENVENUTO.,"With Bandinello, and that stupid beast,"
55922,BENVENUTO.,"The major-domo of Duke Cosimo,"
55923,BENVENUTO.,"Francesco Ricci, and their wretched agent"
55924,BENVENUTO.,"Gorini, who came crawling round about me"
55925,BENVENUTO.,"Like a black spider, with his whining voice"
55926,BENVENUTO.,That sounded like the buzz of a mosquito!
55927,BENVENUTO.,"Oh, I have wept in utter desperation,"
55928,BENVENUTO.,And wished a thousand times I had not left
55929,BENVENUTO.,"My Tour do Nesle, nor e'er returned to Florence,"
55930,BENVENUTO.,Or thought of Perseus.  What malignant falsehoods
55931,BENVENUTO.,"They told the Grand Duke, to impede my work,"
55932,BENVENUTO.,And make me desperate!
55933,BENVENUTO.,
55934,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
55935,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The nimble lie
55936,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Is like the second-hand upon a clock;
55937,MICHAEL ANGELO.,We see it fly; while the hour-hand of truth
55938,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Seems to stand still, and yet it moves unseen,"
55939,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And wins at last, for the clock will not strike"
55940,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Till it has reached the goal.
55941,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
55942,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
55943,BENVENUTO.,My obstinacy
55944,BENVENUTO.,"Stood me in stead, and helped me to o'ercome"
55945,BENVENUTO.,The hindrances that envy and ill-will
55946,BENVENUTO.,Put in my way.
55947,BENVENUTO.,
55948,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
55949,MICHAEL ANGELO.,When anything is done
55950,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"People see not the patient doing of it,"
55951,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Nor think how great would be the loss to man
55952,MICHAEL ANGELO.,If it had not been done.  As in a building
55953,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Stone rests on stone, and wanting the foundation"
55954,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"All would be wanting, so in human life"
55955,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Each action rests on the foregone event,"
55956,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That made it possible, but is forgotten"
55957,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And buried in the earth.
55958,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
55959,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
55960,BENVENUTO.,"Even Bandinello,"
55961,BENVENUTO.,"Who never yet spake well of anything,"
55962,BENVENUTO.,Speaks well of this; and yet he told the Duke
55963,BENVENUTO.,"That, though I cast small figures well enough,"
55964,BENVENUTO.,I never could cast this.
55965,BENVENUTO.,
55966,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
55967,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But you have done it,"
55968,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And proved Ser Bandinello a false prophet.
55969,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That is the wisest way.
55970,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
55971,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
55972,BENVENUTO.,"And ah, that casting"
55973,BENVENUTO.,"What a wild scene it was, as late at night,"
55974,BENVENUTO.,"A night of wind and rain, we heaped the furnace"
55975,BENVENUTO.,"With pine of Serristori, till the flames"
55976,BENVENUTO.,"Caught in the rafters over us, and threatened"
55977,BENVENUTO.,To send the burning roof upon our heads;
55978,BENVENUTO.,And from the garden side the wind and rain
55979,BENVENUTO.,"Poured in upon us, and half quenched our fires."
55980,BENVENUTO.,I was beside myself with desperation.
55981,BENVENUTO.,"A shudder came upon me, then a fever;"
55982,BENVENUTO.,"I thought that I was dying, and was forced"
55983,BENVENUTO.,"To leave the work-shop, and to throw myself"
55984,BENVENUTO.,"Upon my bed, as one who has no hope."
55985,BENVENUTO.,"And as I lay there, a deformed old man"
55986,BENVENUTO.,"Appeared before me, and with dismal voice,"
55987,BENVENUTO.,Like one who doth exhort a criminal
55988,BENVENUTO.,"Led forth to death, exclaimed, ""Poor Benvenuto,"
55989,BENVENUTO.,"Thy work is spoiled!  There is no remedy!"""
55990,BENVENUTO.,"Then, with a cry so loud it might have reached"
55991,BENVENUTO.,"The heaven of fire, I bounded to my feet,"
55992,BENVENUTO.,And rushed back to my workmen.  They all stood
55993,BENVENUTO.,Bewildered and desponding; and I looked
55994,BENVENUTO.,"Into the furnace, and beheld the mass"
55995,BENVENUTO.,"Half molten only, and in my despair"
55996,BENVENUTO.,"I fed the fire with oak, whose terrible heat"
55997,BENVENUTO.,Soon made the sluggish metal shine and sparkle.
55998,BENVENUTO.,"Then followed a bright flash, and an explosion,"
55999,BENVENUTO.,As if a thunderbolt had fallen among us.
56000,BENVENUTO.,The covering of the furnace had been rent
56001,BENVENUTO.,"Asunder, and the bronze was flowing over;"
56002,BENVENUTO.,So that I straightway opened all the sluices
56003,BENVENUTO.,"To fill the mould.  The metal ran like lava,"
56004,BENVENUTO.,Sluggish and heavy; and I sent my workmen
56005,BENVENUTO.,"To ransack the whole house, and bring together"
56006,BENVENUTO.,"My pewter plates and pans, two hundred of them,"
56007,BENVENUTO.,And cast them one by one into the furnace
56008,BENVENUTO.,"To liquefy the mass, and in a moment"
56009,BENVENUTO.,The mould was filled!  I fell upon my knees
56010,BENVENUTO.,And thanked the Lord; and then we ate and drank
56011,BENVENUTO.,"And went to bed, all hearty and contented."
56012,BENVENUTO.,It was two hours before the break of day.
56013,BENVENUTO.,My fever was quite gone.
56014,BENVENUTO.,
56015,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56016,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A strange adventure,"
56017,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That could have happened to no man alive
56018,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But you, my Benvenuto."
56019,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56020,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56021,BENVENUTO.,As my workmen said
56022,BENVENUTO.,"To major-domo Ricci afterward,"
56023,BENVENUTO.,"When he inquired of them: ""'T was not a man,"
56024,BENVENUTO.,"But an express great devil."""
56025,BENVENUTO.,
56026,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56027,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And the statue?
56028,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56029,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56030,BENVENUTO.,"Perfect in every part, save the right foot"
56031,BENVENUTO.,"Of Perseus, as I had foretold the Duke."
56032,BENVENUTO.,There was just bronze enough to fill the mould;
56033,BENVENUTO.,"Not a drop over, not a drop too little."
56034,BENVENUTO.,I looked upon it as a miracle
56035,BENVENUTO.,Wrought by the hand of God.
56036,BENVENUTO.,
56037,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56038,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And now I see
56039,MICHAEL ANGELO.,How you have turned your vices into virtues.
56040,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56041,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56042,BENVENUTO.,But wherefore do I prate of this?  I came
56043,BENVENUTO.,To speak of other things.  Duke Cosimo
56044,BENVENUTO.,"Through me invites you to return to Florence,"
56045,BENVENUTO.,"And offers you great honors, even to make you"
56046,BENVENUTO.,"One of the Forty-Eight, his Senators."
56047,BENVENUTO.,
56048,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56049,MICHAEL ANGELO.,His Senators!  That is enough.  Since Florence
56050,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Was changed by Clement Seventh from a Republic
56051,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Into a Dukedom, I no longer wish"
56052,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To be a Florentine.  That dream is ended.
56053,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The Grand Duke Cosimo now reigns supreme;
56054,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"All liberty is dead.  Ah, woe is me!"
56055,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I hoped to see my country rise to heights
56056,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of happiness and freedom yet unreached
56057,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"By other nations, but the climbing wave"
56058,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Pauses, lets go its hold, and slides again"
56059,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Back to the common level, with a hoarse"
56060,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Death rattle in its throat.  I am too old
56061,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To hope for better days.  I will stay here
56062,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And die in Rome.  The very weeds, that grow"
56063,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Among the broken fragments of her ruins,"
56064,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Are sweeter to me than the garden flowers
56065,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of other cities; and the desolate ring
56066,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of the Campagna round about her walls
56067,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Fairer than all the villas that encircle
56068,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The towns of Tuscany.
56069,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56070,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56071,BENVENUTO.,But your old friends!
56072,BENVENUTO.,
56073,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56074,MICHAEL ANGELO.,All dead by violence.  Baccio Valori
56075,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Has been beheaded; Guicciardini poisoned;
56076,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Philippo Strozzi strangled in his prison.
56077,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Is Florence then a place for honest men
56078,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To flourish in?  What is there to prevent
56079,MICHAEL ANGELO.,My sharing the same fate?
56080,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56081,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56082,BENVENUTO.,Why this: if all
56083,BENVENUTO.,"Your friends are dead, so are your enemies."
56084,BENVENUTO.,
56085,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56086,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Is Aretino dead?
56087,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56088,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56089,BENVENUTO.,"He lives in Venice,"
56090,BENVENUTO.,And not in Florence.
56091,BENVENUTO.,
56092,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56093,MICHAEL ANGELO.,'T is the same to me
56094,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"This wretched mountebank, whom flatterers"
56095,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Call the Divine, as if to make the word"
56096,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Unpleasant in the mouths of those who speak it
56097,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And in the ears of those who hear it, sends me"
56098,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A letter written for the public eye,"
56099,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And with such subtle and infernal malice,"
56100,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I wonder at his wickedness.  'T is he
56101,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Is the express great devil, and not you."
56102,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Some years ago he told me how to paint
56103,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The scenes of the Last Judgment.
56104,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56105,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56106,BENVENUTO.,I remember.
56107,BENVENUTO.,
56108,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56109,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Well, now he writes to me that, as a Christian,"
56110,MICHAEL ANGELO.,He is ashamed of the unbounded freedom
56111,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With which I represent it.
56112,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56113,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56114,BENVENUTO.,Hypocrite!
56115,BENVENUTO.,
56116,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56117,MICHAEL ANGELO.,He says I show mankind that I am wanting
56118,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In piety and religion, in proportion"
56119,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As I profess perfection in my art.
56120,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Profess perfection?  Why, 't is only men"
56121,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Like Bugiardini who are satisfied
56122,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With what they do.  I never am content,"
56123,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But always see the labors of my hand
56124,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Fall short of my conception.
56125,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56126,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56127,BENVENUTO.,I perceive
56128,BENVENUTO.,The malice of this creature.  He would taint you
56129,BENVENUTO.,"With heresy, and in a time like this!"
56130,BENVENUTO.,'T is infamous!
56131,BENVENUTO.,
56132,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56133,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I represent the angels
56134,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Without their heavenly glory, and the saints"
56135,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Without a trace of earthly modesty.
56136,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56137,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56138,BENVENUTO.,Incredible audacity!
56139,BENVENUTO.,
56140,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56141,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The heathen
56142,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Veiled their Diana with some drapery,"
56143,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And when they represented Venus naked
56144,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"They made her by her modest attitude,"
56145,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Appear half clothed.  But I, who am a Christian,"
56146,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Do so subordinate belief to art
56147,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That I have made the very violation
56148,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of modesty in martyrs and in virgins
56149,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A spectacle at which all men would gaze
56150,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With half-averted eyes even in a brothel.
56151,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56152,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56153,BENVENUTO.,"He is at home there, and he ought to know"
56154,BENVENUTO.,What men avert their eyes from in such places;
56155,BENVENUTO.,"From the Last Judgment chiefly, I imagine."
56156,BENVENUTO.,
56157,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56158,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But divine Providence will never leave
56159,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The boldness of my marvellous work unpunished;
56160,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And the more marvellous it is, the more"
56161,MICHAEL ANGELO.,'T is sure to prove the ruin of my fame!
56162,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And finally, if in this composition"
56163,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I had pursued the instructions that he gave me
56164,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Concerning heaven and hell and paradise,"
56165,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"In that same letter, known to all the world,"
56166,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Nature would not be forced, as she is now,"
56167,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To feel ashamed that she invested me
56168,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With such great talent; that I stand myself
56169,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A very idol in the world of art.
56170,MICHAEL ANGELO.,He taunts me also with the Mausoleum
56171,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of Julius, still unfinished, for the reason"
56172,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That men persuaded the inane old man
56173,MICHAEL ANGELO.,It was of evil augury to build
56174,MICHAEL ANGELO.,His tomb while he was living; and he speaks
56175,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of heaps of gold this Pope bequeathed to me,"
56176,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And calls it robbery;--that is what he says.
56177,MICHAEL ANGELO.,What prompted such a letter?
56178,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56179,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56180,BENVENUTO.,Vanity.
56181,BENVENUTO.,"He is a clever writer, and he likes"
56182,BENVENUTO.,"To draw his pen, and flourish it in the face"
56183,BENVENUTO.,"Of every honest man, as swordsmen do"
56184,BENVENUTO.,"Their rapiers on occasion, but to show"
56185,BENVENUTO.,How skilfully they do it.  Had you followed
56186,BENVENUTO.,"The advice he gave, or even thanked him for it,"
56187,BENVENUTO.,You would have seen another style of fence.
56188,BENVENUTO.,"'T is but his wounded vanity, and the wish"
56189,BENVENUTO.,To see his name in print.  So give it not
56190,BENVENUTO.,A moment's thought; it soon will be forgotten.
56191,BENVENUTO.,
56192,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56193,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I will not think of it, but let it pass"
56194,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"For a rude speech thrown at me in the street,"
56195,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As boys threw stones at Dante.
56196,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56197,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56198,BENVENUTO.,And what answer
56199,BENVENUTO.,Shall I take back to Grand Duke Cosimo?
56200,BENVENUTO.,He does not ask your labor or your service;
56201,BENVENUTO.,"Only your presence in the city of Florence,"
56202,BENVENUTO.,With such advice upon his work in hand
56203,BENVENUTO.,"As he may ask, and you may choose to give."
56204,BENVENUTO.,
56205,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56206,MICHAEL ANGELO.,You have my answer.  Nothing he can offer
56207,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Shall tempt me to leave Rome.  My work is here,"
56208,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And only here, the building of St. Peter's."
56209,MICHAEL ANGELO.,What other things I hitherto have done
56210,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Have fallen from me, are no longer mine;"
56211,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"I have passed on beyond them, and have left them"
56212,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"As milestones on the way.  What lies before me,"
56213,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That is still mine, and while it is unfinished"
56214,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"No one shall draw me from it, or persuade me,"
56215,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"By promises of ease, or wealth, or honor,"
56216,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Till I behold the finished dome uprise
56217,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Complete, as now I see it in my thought."
56218,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56219,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56220,BENVENUTO.,And will you paint no more?
56221,BENVENUTO.,
56222,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56223,MICHAEL ANGELO.,No more.
56224,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56225,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56226,BENVENUTO.,'T is well.
56227,BENVENUTO.,"Sculpture is more divine, and more like Nature,"
56228,BENVENUTO.,"That fashions all her works in high relief,"
56229,BENVENUTO.,"And that is sculpture.  This vast ball, the Earth,"
56230,BENVENUTO.,"Was moulded out of clay, and baked in fire;"
56231,BENVENUTO.,"Men, women, and all animals that breathe"
56232,BENVENUTO.,"Are statues, and not paintings.  Even the plants,"
56233,BENVENUTO.,"The flowers, the fruits, the grasses, were first sculptured,"
56234,BENVENUTO.,"And colored later.  Painting is a lie,"
56235,BENVENUTO.,A shadow merely.
56236,BENVENUTO.,
56237,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56238,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Truly, as you say,"
56239,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Sculpture is more than painting.  It is greater
56240,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To raise the dead to life than to create
56241,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Phantoms that seem to live.  The most majestic
56242,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Of the three sister arts is that which builds;
56243,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The eldest of them all, to whom the others"
56244,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Are but the hand-maids and the servitors,"
56245,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Being but imitation, not creation."
56246,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Henceforth I dedicate myself to her.
56247,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56248,BENVENUTO.,BENVENUTO.
56249,BENVENUTO.,And no more from the marble hew those forms
56250,BENVENUTO.,That fill us all with wonder?
56251,BENVENUTO.,
56252,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56253,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Many statues
56254,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Will there be room for in my work.  Their station
56255,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Already is assigned them in my mind.
56256,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"But things move slowly.  There are hindrances,"
56257,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Want of material, want of means, delays"
56258,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And interruptions, endless interference"
56259,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of Cardinal Commissioners, and disputes"
56260,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And jealousies of artists, that annoy me."
56261,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But twill persevere until the work
56262,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Is wholly finished, or till I sink down"
56263,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Surprised by death, that unexpected guest,"
56264,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Who waits for no man's leisure, but steps in,"
56265,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Unasked and unannounced, to put a stop"
56266,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To all our occupations and designs.
56267,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And then perhaps I may go back to Florence;
56268,MICHAEL ANGELO.,This is my answer to Duke Cosimo.

56280,MICHAEL ANGELO'S STUDIO,
56281,URBINO.,URBINO.
56282,URBINO.,Eccellenza.
56283,URBINO.,That is impossible.  Do I not see you
56284,URBINO.,Attack the marble blocks with the same fury
56285,URBINO.,As twenty years ago?
56286,URBINO.,
56287,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56288,MICHAEL ANGELO.,'T is an old habit.
56289,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I must have learned it early from my nurse
56290,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"At Setignano, the stone-mason's wife;"
56291,MICHAEL ANGELO.,For the first sounds I heard were of the chisel
56292,MICHAEL ANGELO.,chipping away the stone.
56293,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56294,URBINO.,URBINO.
56295,URBINO.,At every stroke
56296,URBINO.,You strike fire with your chisel.
56297,URBINO.,
56298,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56299,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Ay, because"
56300,MICHAEL ANGELO.,The marble is too hard.
56301,MICHAEL ANGELO.,
56302,URBINO.,URBINO.
56303,URBINO.,It is a block
56304,URBINO.,That Topolino sent you from Carrara.
56305,URBINO.,He is a judge of marble.
56306,URBINO.,
56307,MICHAEL ANGELO.,MICHAEL ANGELO.
56308,MICHAEL ANGELO.,I remember.
56309,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With it he sent me something of his making,--"
56310,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"A Mercury, with long body and short legs,"
56311,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As if by any possibility
56312,MICHAEL ANGELO.,A messenger of the gods could have short legs.
56313,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"It was no more like Mercury than you are,"
56314,MICHAEL ANGELO.,But rather like those little plaster figures
56315,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That peddlers hawk about the villages
56316,MICHAEL ANGELO.,As images of saints.  But luckily
56317,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"For Topolino, there are many people"
56318,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Who see no difference between what is best
56319,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And what is only good, or not even good;"
56320,MICHAEL ANGELO.,So that poor artists stand in their esteem
56321,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"On the same level with the best, or higher."

56344,MICHAEL ANGELO.,To hew away the stone walls that imprison

56361,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"As to imagine he would let thee serve,"

56404,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Surges and undulations of the air
56405,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Uplift the leafy boughs, and let them fall"
56406,MICHAEL ANGELO.,With scarce a sound.  Such sylvan quietudes
56407,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Become old age.  These huge centennial oaks,"
56408,MICHAEL ANGELO.,That may have heard in infancy the trumpets
56409,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of Barbarossa's cavalry, deride"
56410,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Man's brief existence, that with all his strength"
56411,MICHAEL ANGELO.,He cannot stretch beyond the hundredth year.
56412,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"This little acorn, turbaned like the Turk,"

56414,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Hereafter, feeding with its bitter mast"

56418,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"They and their children, and their children's children,"
56419,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Shall be but dust and mould, and nothing more."
56420,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Through openings in the trees I see below me
56421,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"The valley of Clitumnus, with its farms"
56422,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And snow-white oxen grazing in the shade

56429,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Yonder I see the little hermitages
56430,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Dotting the mountain side with points of light,"
56431,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And here St. Julian's convent, like a nest"
56432,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Of curlews, clinging to some windy cliff."
56433,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Beyond the broad, illimitable plain"
56434,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Down sinks the sun, red as Apollo's quoit,"
56435,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"That, by the envious Zephyr blown aside,"
56436,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Struck Hyacinthus dead, and stained the earth"
56437,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With his young blood, that blossomed into flowers."
56438,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"And now, instead of these fair deities"

56516,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"You would but see a man of fourscore years,"
56517,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"With sunken eyes, burning like carbuncles,"
56518,MICHAEL ANGELO.,"Who sits at table with his friends for hours,"
56519,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Cursing the Spaniards as a race of Jews
56520,MICHAEL ANGELO.,And miscreant Moors.  And with what soldiery
56521,MICHAEL ANGELO.,Think you he now defends the Eternal City?

56750,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Our lives are rivers, gliding free"
56751,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To that unfathomed, boundless sea,"
56752,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The silent grave!
56753,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Thither all earthly pomp and boast
56754,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Roll, to be swallowed up and lost"
56755,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In one dark wave.
56756,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56757,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Thither the mighty torrents stray,"
56758,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Thither the brook pursues its way,"
56759,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And tinkling rill,"
56760,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,There all are equal; side by side
56761,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The poor man and the son of pride
56762,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Lie calm and still.
56763,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56764,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,I will not here invoke the throng
56765,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Of orators and sons of song,"
56766,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The deathless few;
56767,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Fiction entices and deceives,"
56768,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And, sprinkled o'er her fragrant leaves,"
56769,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Lies poisonous dew.
56770,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56771,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To One alone my thoughts arise,"
56772,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The Eternal Truth, the Good and Wise,"
56773,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To Him I cry,"
56774,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Who shared on earth our common lot,"
56775,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,But the world comprehended not
56776,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,His deity.
56777,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56778,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,This world is but the rugged road
56779,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Which leads us to the bright abode
56780,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Of peace above;
56781,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"So let us choose that narrow way,"
56782,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Which leads no traveller's foot astray
56783,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"From realms of love,"
56784,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56785,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Our cradle is the starting-place,"
56786,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Life is the running of the race,"
56787,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,We reach the goal
56788,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"When, in the mansions of the blest,"
56789,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Death leaves to its eternal rest
56790,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The weary soul.
56791,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56792,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Did we but use it as we ought,"
56793,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,This world would school each wandering thought
56794,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,To its high state.
56795,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Faith wings the soul beyond the sky,"
56796,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Up to that better world on high,"
56797,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,For which we wait.
56798,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56799,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Yes, the glad messenger of love,"
56800,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To guide us to our home above,"
56801,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The Saviour came;
56802,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Born amid mortal cares and fears.
56803,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,He suffered in this vale of tears
56804,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,A death of shame.
56805,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56806,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Behold of what delusive worth
56807,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The bubbles we pursue on earth,"
56808,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The shapes we chase,"
56809,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Amid a world of treachery!
56810,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"They vanish ere death shuts the eye,"
56811,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And leave no trace.
56812,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56813,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Time steals them from us, chances strange,"
56814,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Disastrous accident, and change,"
56815,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,That come to all;
56816,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Even in the most exalted state,"
56817,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Relentless sweeps the stroke of fate;
56818,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The strongest fall.
56819,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56820,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Tell me, the charms that lovers seek"
56821,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"In the clear eye and blushing cheek,"
56822,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The hues that play
56823,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"O'er rosy lip and brow of snow,"
56824,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"When hoary age approaches slow,"
56825,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Ah; where are they?
56826,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56827,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The cunning skill, the curious arts,"
56828,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The glorious strength that youth imparts
56829,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In life's first stage;
56830,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"These shall become a heavy weight,"
56831,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,When Time swings wide his outward gate
56832,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,To weary age.
56833,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56834,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The noble blood of Gothic name,"
56835,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Heroes emblazoned high to fame,"
56836,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In long array;
56837,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"How, in the onward course of time,"
56838,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The landmarks of that race sublime
56839,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Were swept away!
56840,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56841,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Some, the degraded slaves of lust,"
56842,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Prostrate and trampled in the dust,"
56843,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Shall rise no more;
56844,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Others, by guilt and crime, maintain"
56845,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The scutcheon, that without a stain,"
56846,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Their fathers bore.
56847,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56848,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Wealth and the high estate of pride,"
56849,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"With what untimely speed they glide,"
56850,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,How soon depart!
56851,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Bid not the shadowy phantoms stay,"
56852,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The vassals of a mistress they,"
56853,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Of fickle heart.
56854,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56855,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,These gifts in Fortune's hands are found;
56856,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Her swift revolving wheel turns round,"
56857,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And they are gone!
56858,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"No rest the inconstant goddess knows,"
56859,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"But changing, and without repose,"
56860,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Still hurries on.
56861,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56862,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Even could the hand of avarice save
56863,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Its gilded baubles till the grave
56864,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Reclaimed its prey,"
56865,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Let none on such poor hopes rely;
56866,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Life, like an empty dream, flits by,"
56867,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And where are they?
56868,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56869,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Earthly desires and sensual lust
56870,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Are passions springing from the dust,"
56871,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,They fade and die;
56872,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"But in the life beyond the tomb,"
56873,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,They seal the immortal spirits doom
56874,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Eternally!
56875,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56876,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The pleasures and delights, which mask"
56877,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"In treacherous smiles life's serious task,"
56878,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What are they, all,"
56879,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"But the fleet coursers of the chase,"
56880,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And death an ambush in the race,"
56881,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Wherein we fall?
56882,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56883,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"No foe, no dangerous pass, we heed,"
56884,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Brook no delay, but onward speed"
56885,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,With loosened rein;
56886,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And, when the fatal snare is near,"
56887,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"We strive to check our mad career,"
56888,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,But strive in vain.
56889,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56890,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Could we new charms to age impart,"
56891,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And fashion with a cunning art
56892,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The human face,"
56893,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"As we can clothe the soul with light,"
56894,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And make the glorious spirit bright
56895,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"With heavenly grace,"
56896,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56897,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,How busily each passing hour
56898,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Should we exert that magic power,"
56899,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What ardor show,"
56900,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To deck the sensual slave of sin,"
56901,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Yet leave the freeborn soul within,"
56902,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In weeds of woe!
56903,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56904,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Monarchs, the powerful and the strong,"
56905,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Famous in history and in song
56906,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Of olden time,"
56907,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Saw, by the stern decrees of fate,"
56908,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Their kingdoms lost, and desolate"
56909,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Their race sublime.
56910,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56911,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Who is the champion? who the strong?
56912,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Pontiff and priest, and sceptred throng?"
56913,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,On these shall fall
56914,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"As heavily the hand of Death,"
56915,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,As when it stays the shepherd's breath
56916,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Beside his stall.
56917,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56918,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"I speak not of the Trojan name,"
56919,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Neither its glory nor its shame
56920,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Has met our eyes;
56921,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Nor of Rome's great and glorious dead,"
56922,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Though we have heard so oft, and read,"
56923,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Their histories.
56924,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56925,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Little avails it now to know
56926,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Of ages passed so long ago,"
56927,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Nor how they rolled;
56928,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Our theme shall be of yesterday,"
56929,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Which to oblivion sweeps away,"
56930,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Like day's of old.
56931,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56932,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Where is the King, Don Juan?  Where"
56933,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Each royal prince and noble heir
56934,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Of Aragon?
56935,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Where are the courtly gallantries?
56936,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The deeds of love and high emprise,"
56937,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In battle done?
56938,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56939,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Tourney and joust, that charmed the eye,"
56940,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And scarf, and gorgeous panoply,"
56941,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And nodding plume,"
56942,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,What were they but a pageant scene?
56943,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What but the garlands, gay and green,"
56944,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,That deck the tomb?
56945,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56946,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Where are the high-born dames, and where"
56947,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Their gay attire, and jewelled hair,"
56948,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And odors sweet?
56949,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Where are the gentle knights, that came"
56950,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To kneel, and breathe love's ardent flame,"
56951,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Low at their feet?
56952,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56953,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Where is the song of Troubadour?
56954,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Where are the lute and gay tambour
56955,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,They loved of yore?
56956,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Where is the mazy dance of old,"
56957,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The flowing robes, inwrought with gold,"
56958,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The dancers wore?
56959,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56960,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And he who next the sceptre swayed,"
56961,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Henry, whose royal court displayed"
56962,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Such power and pride;
56963,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"O, in what winning smiles arrayed,"
56964,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The world its various pleasures laid
56965,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,His throne beside!
56966,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56967,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,But O how false and full of guile
56968,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"That world, which wore so soft a smile"
56969,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,But to betray!
56970,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"She, that had been his friend before,"
56971,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Now from the fated monarch tore
56972,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Her charms away.
56973,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56974,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The countless gifts, the stately walls,"
56975,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The loyal palaces, and halls"
56976,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,All filled with gold;
56977,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Plate with armorial bearings wrought,"
56978,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Chambers with ample treasures fraught
56979,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Of wealth untold;
56980,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56981,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The noble steeds, and harness bright,"
56982,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And gallant lord, and stalwart knight,"
56983,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"In rich array,"
56984,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Where shall we seek them now?  Alas!
56985,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Like the bright dewdrops on the grass,"
56986,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,They passed away.
56987,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56988,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His brother, too, whose factious zeal"
56989,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Usurped the sceptre of Castile,"
56990,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Unskilled to reign;
56991,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What a gay, brilliant court had he,"
56992,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,When all the flower of chivalry
56993,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Was in his train!
56994,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
56995,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"But he was mortal; and the breath,"
56996,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"That flamed from the hot forge of Death,"
56997,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Blasted his years;
56998,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Judgment of God! that flame by thee,"
56999,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"When raging fierce and fearfully,"
57000,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Was quenched in tears!
57001,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57002,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Spain's haughty Constable, the true"
57003,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And gallant Master, whom we knew"
57004,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Most loved of all;
57005,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Breathe not a whisper of his pride,"
57006,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"He on the gloomy scaffold died,"
57007,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Ignoble fall!
57008,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57009,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The countless treasures of his care,"
57010,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His villages and villas fair,"
57011,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His mighty power,"
57012,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What were they all but grief and shame,"
57013,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Tears and a broken heart, when came"
57014,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The parting hour?
57015,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57016,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His other brothers, proud and high,"
57017,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Masters, who, in prosperity,"
57018,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Might rival kings;
57019,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Who made the bravest and the best
57020,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The bondsmen of their high behest,"
57021,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Their underlings;
57022,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57023,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What was their prosperous estate,"
57024,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,When high exalted and elate
57025,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,With power and pride?
57026,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"What, but a transient gleam of light,"
57027,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"A flame, which, glaring at its height,"
57028,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Grew dim and died?
57029,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57030,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"So many a duke of royal name,"
57031,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Marquis and count of spotless fame,"
57032,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And baron brave,"
57033,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"That might the sword of empire wield,"
57034,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"All these, O Death, hast thou concealed"
57035,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In the dark grave!
57036,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57037,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Their deeds of mercy and of arms,"
57038,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"In peaceful days, or war's alarms,"
57039,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,When thou dost show.
57040,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"O Death, thy stern and angry face,"
57041,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,One stroke of thy all-powerful mace
57042,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Can overthrow.
57043,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57044,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Unnumbered hosts, that threaten nigh,"
57045,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Pennon and standard flaunting high,"
57046,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And flag displayed;
57047,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"High battlements intrenched around,"
57048,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Bastion, and moated wall, and mound,"
57049,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And palisade,"
57050,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57051,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And covered trench, secure and deep,"
57052,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"All these cannot one victim keep,"
57053,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"O Death, from thee,"
57054,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"When thou dost battle in thy wrath,"
57055,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And thy strong shafts pursue their path
57056,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Unerringly.
57057,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57058,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"O World! so few the years we live,"
57059,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Would that the life which thou dost give
57060,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Were life indeed!
57061,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Alas! thy sorrows fall so fast,"
57062,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Our happiest hour is when at last
57063,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The soul is freed.
57064,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57065,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Our days are covered o'er with grief,"
57066,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And sorrows neither few nor brief
57067,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Veil all in gloom;
57068,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Left desolate of real good,"
57069,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Within this cheerless solitude
57070,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,No pleasures bloom.
57071,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57072,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Thy pilgrimage begins in tears,"
57073,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And ends in bitter doubts and fears,"
57074,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Or dark despair;
57075,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Midway so many toils appear,"
57076,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,That he who lingers longest here
57077,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Knows most of care.
57078,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57079,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Thy goods are bought with many a groan,"
57080,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"By the hot sweat of toil alone,"
57081,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And weary hearts;
57082,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Fleet-footed is the approach of woe,"
57083,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,But with a lingering step and slow
57084,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Its form departs.
57085,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57086,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And he, the good man's shield and shade,"
57087,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"To whom all hearts their homage paid,"
57088,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"As Virtue's son,"
57089,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Roderic Manrique, he whose name"
57090,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Is written on the scroll of Fame,"
57091,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Spain's champion;
57092,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57093,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,His signal deeds and prowess high
57094,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Demand no pompous eulogy.
57095,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Ye saw his deeds!
57096,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Why should their praise in verse be sung?
57097,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The name, that dwells on every tongue,"
57098,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,No minstrel needs.
57099,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57100,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,To friends a friend; how kind to all
57101,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The vassals of this ancient hall
57102,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And feudal fief!
57103,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,To foes how stern a foe was he!
57104,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And to the valiant and the free
57105,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,How brave a chief!
57106,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57107,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,What prudence with the old and wise:
57108,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,What grace in youthful gayeties;
57109,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In all how sage!
57110,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Benignant to the serf and slave,"
57111,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,He showed the base and falsely brave
57112,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,A lion's rage.
57113,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57114,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His was Octavian's prosperous star,"
57115,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,The rush of Caesar's conquering car
57116,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,At battle's call;
57117,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His, Scipio's virtue; his, the skill"
57118,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And the indomitable will
57119,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,Of Hannibal.
57120,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57121,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"His was a Trajan's goodness, his"
57122,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,A Titus' noble charities
57123,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And righteous laws;
57124,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The arm of Hector, and the might"
57125,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Of Tully, to maintain the right"
57126,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,In truth's just cause;
57127,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57128,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The clemency of Antonine,"
57129,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Aurelius' countenance divine,"
57130,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"Firm, gentle, still;"
57131,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"The eloquence of Adrian,"
57132,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"And Theodosius' love to man,"
57133,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And generous will;
57134,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,
57135,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,"In tented field and bloody fray,"
57136,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,An Alexander's vigorous sway
57137,COPLAS DE MANRIQUE,And stern command;

58000,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Pentecost, day of rejoicing, had come. The church of the village"
58001,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Gleaming stood in the morning's sheen.
58002,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,On the spire of the bell
58003,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Decked with a brazen cock, the friendly flames of the Spring-sun"
58004,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Glanced like the tongues of fire, beheld by Apostles aforetime."
58005,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Clear was the heaven and blue, and May, with her cap crowned with roses,"
58006,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Stood in her holiday dress in the fields, and the wind and the brooklet"
58007,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Murmured gladness and peace, God's-peace! with lips rosy-tinted"
58008,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Whispered the race of the flowers, and merry on balancing branches"
58009,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Birds were singing their carol, a jubilant hymn to the Highest."
58010,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Swept and clean was the churchyard. Adorned like a leaf-woven arbor
58011,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Stood its old-fashioned gate; and within upon each cross of iron
58012,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hung was a fragrant garland, new twined by the hands of affection."
58013,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Even the dial, that stood on a mound among the departed,"
58014,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"(There full a hundred years had it stood,) was embellished with blossoms"
58015,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Like to the patriarch hoary, the sage of his kith and the hamlet,"
58016,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Who on his birthday is crowned by children and children's children,"
58017,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"So stood the ancient prophet, and mute with his pencil of iron"
58018,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Marked on the tablet of stone, and measured the time and its changes,"
58019,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"While all around at his feet, an eternity slumbered in quiet."
58020,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Also the church within was adorned, for this was the season"
58021,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"When the young, their parents' hope, and the loved-ones of heaven,"
58022,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Should at the foot of the altar renew the vows of their baptism.
58023,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Therefore each nook and corner was swept and cleaned, and the dust was"
58024,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Blown from the walls and ceiling, and from the oil-painted benches."
58025,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,There stood the church like a garden; the Feast of the Leafy Pavilions
58026,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Saw we in living presentment. From noble arms on the church wall
58027,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Grew forth a cluster of leaves, and the preacher's pulpit of oak-wood"
58028,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Budded once more anew, as aforetime the rod before Aaron."
58029,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Wreathed thereon was the Bible with leaves, and the dove, washed with silver"
58030,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Under its canopy fastened, had on it a necklace of wind-flowers."
58031,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"But in front of the choir, round the altar-piece painted by Horberg,"
58032,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Crept a garland gigantic; and bright-curling tresses of angels
58033,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Peeped, like the sun from a cloud, from out of the shadowy leaf-work."
58034,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Likewise the lustre of brass, new-polished, blinked from the ceiling,"
58035,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,And for lights there were lilies of Pentecost set in the sockets.
58036,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58037,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Loud rang the bells already; the thronging crowd was assembled
58038,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Far from valleys and hills, to list to the holy preaching."
58039,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hark! then roll forth at once the mighty tones of the organ,"
58040,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hover like voices from God, aloft like invisible spirits."
58041,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Like as Elias in heaven, when he cast from off him his mantle,"
58042,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,So cast off the soul its garments of earth; and with one voice
58043,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Chimed in the congregation, and sang an anthem immortal"
58044,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Of the sublime Wallin, of David's harp in the North-land"
58045,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Tuned to the choral of Luther; the song on its mighty pinions
58046,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Took every living soul, and lifted it gently to heaven,"
58047,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,And each face did shine like the Holy One's face upon Tabor.
58048,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Lo! there entered then into the church the Reverend Teacher.
58049,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Father he hight and he was in the parish; a Christianly plainness
58050,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Clothed from his head to his feet the old man of seventy winters.
58051,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Friendly was he to behold, and glad as the heralding angel"
58052,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Walked he among the crowds, but still a contemplative grandeur"
58053,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Lay on his forehead as clear as on moss-covered gravestone a sunbeam.
58054,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,As in his inspiration (an evening twilight that faintly
58055,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Gleams in the human soul, even now, from the day of creation)"
58056,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Th' Artist, the friend of heaven, imagines Saint John when in Patmos,"
58057,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Gray, with his eyes uplifted to heaven, so seemed then the old man:"
58058,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Such was the glance of his eye, and such were his tresses of silver."
58059,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,All the congregation arose in the pews that were numbered.
58060,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"But with a cordial look, to the right and the left hand, the old man"
58061,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Nodding all hail and peace, disappeared in the innermost chancel."
58062,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58063,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Simply and solemnly now proceeded the Christian service,"
58064,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Singing and prayer, and at last an ardent discourse from the old man."
58065,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Many a moving word and warning, that out of the heart came,"
58066,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Fell like the dew of the morning, like manna on those in the desert."
58067,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Then, when all was finished, the Teacher re-entered the chancel"
58068,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Followed therein by the young. The boys on the right had their places,"
58069,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Delicate figures, with close-curling hair and cheeks rosy-blooming."
58070,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"But on the left of these there stood the tremulous lilies,"
58071,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Tinged with the blushing light of the dawn, the diffident maidens,--"
58072,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Folding their hands in prayer, and their eyes cast down on the pavement"
58073,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Now came, with question and answer, the catechism. In the beginning"
58074,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Answered the children with troubled and faltering voice, but the old man's"
58075,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Glances of kindness encouraged them soon, and the doctrines eternal"
58076,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Flowed, like the waters of fountains, so clear from lips unpolluted."
58077,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Each time the answer was closed, and as oft as they named the Redeemer,"
58078,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Lowly louted the boys, and lowly the maidens all courtesied."
58079,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Friendly the Teacher stood, like an angel of light there among them."
58080,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"And to the children explained the holy, the highest, in few words,"
58081,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Thorough, yet simple and clear, for sublimity always is simple,"
58082,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Both in sermon and song, a child can seize on its meaning."
58083,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,E'en as the green-growing bud unfolds when Springtide approaches.
58084,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Leaf by leaf puts forth, and warmed, by the radiant sunshine,"
58085,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Blushes with purple and gold, till at last the perfected blossom"
58086,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Opens its odorous chalice, and rocks with its crown in the breezes,"
58087,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"So was unfolded here the Christian lore of salvation,"
58088,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Line by line from the soul of childhood. The fathers and mothers
58089,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Stood behind them in tears, and were glad at the well-worded answer."
58090,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58091,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Now went the old man up to the altar;--and straightway transfigured
58092,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,(So did it seem unto me) was then the affectionate Teacher.
58093,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Like the Lord's Prophet sublime, and awful as Death and as Judgment"
58094,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Stood he, the God-commissioned, the soul-searcher, earthward descending"
58095,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Glances, sharp as a sword, into hearts that to him were transparent"
58096,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Shot he; his voice was deep, was low like the thunder afar off."
58097,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"So on a sudden transfigured he stood there, lie spake and he questioned."
58098,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58099,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"""This is the faith of the Fathers, the faith the Apostles delivered,"
58100,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"This is moreover the faith whereunto I baptized you, while still ye"
58101,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Lay on your mothers' breasts, and nearer the portals of heaven,"
58102,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Slumbering received you then the Holy Church in its bosom;
58103,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Wakened from sleep are ye now, and the light in its radiant splendor"
58104,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Downward rains from the heaven;--to-day on the threshold of childhood
58105,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Kindly she frees you again, to examine and make your election,"
58106,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"For she knows naught of compulsion, and only conviction desireth."
58107,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"This is the hour of your trial, the turning-point of existence,"
58108,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Seed for the coming days; without revocation departeth
58109,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Now from your lips the confession; Bethink ye, before ye make answer!"
58110,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Think not, O think not with guile to deceive the questioning Teacher."
58111,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Sharp is his eye to-day, and a curse ever rests upon falsehood."
58112,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Enter not with a lie on Life's journey; the multitude hears you,"
58113,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Brothers and sisters and parents, what dear upon earth is and holy"
58114,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Standeth before your sight as a witness; the Judge everlasting
58115,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Looks from the sun down upon you, and angels in waiting beside him"
58116,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Grave your confession in letters of fire upon tablets eternal.
58117,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Thus, then,--believe ye in God, in the Father who this world created?"
58118,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Him who redeemed it, the Son, and the Spirit where both are united?"
58119,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Will ye promise me here, (a holy promise!) to cherish"
58120,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"God more than all things earthly, and every man as a brother?"
58121,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Will ye promise me here, to confirm your faith by your living,"
58122,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Th' heavenly faith of affection! to hope, to forgive, and to suffer,"
58123,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Be what it may your condition, and walk before God in uprightness?"
58124,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Will ye promise me this before God and man?""--With a clear voice"
58125,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Answered the young men Yes! and Yes! with lips softly-breathing
58126,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Answered the maidens eke. Then dissolved from the brow of the Teacher
58127,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Clouds with the lightnings therein, and lie spake in accents more gentle,"
58128,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Soft as the evening's breath, as harps by Babylon's rivers."
58129,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58130,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"""Hail, then, hail to you all! To the heirdom of heaven be ye welcome!"
58131,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Children no more from this day, but by covenant brothers and sisters!"
58132,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Yet,--for what reason not children? Of such is the kingdom of heaven."
58133,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Here upon earth an assemblage of children, in heaven one Father,"
58134,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Ruling them all as his household,--forgiving in turn and chastising,"
58135,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"That is of human life a picture, as Scripture has taught us."
58136,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Blest are the pure before God! Upon purity and upon virtue
58137,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Resteth the Christian Faith: she herself from on high is descended.
58138,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Strong as a man and pure as a child, is the sum of the doctrine,"
58139,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Which the Divine One taught, and suffered and died on the cross for"
58140,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Oh, as ye wander this day from childhood's sacred asylum"
58141,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Downward and ever downward, and deeper in Age's chill valley,"
58142,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Oh, how soon will ye come,--too soon!--and long to turn backward"
58143,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Up to its hill-tops again, to the sun-illumined, where Judgment"
58144,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Stood like a father before you, and Pardon, clad like a mother,"
58145,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Gave you her hand to kiss, and the loving heart was for given"
58146,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Life was a play and your hands grasped after the roses of heaven!
58147,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Seventy years have I lived already; the Father eternal
58148,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Gave rue gladness and care; but the loveliest hours of existence,"

58163,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Son of Eternity, fettered in Time, and an exile, the Spirit"
58164,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Tugs at his chains evermore, and struggles like flame ever upward."
58165,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Still he recalls with emotion his Father's manifold mansions,"

58172,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Crushes to earth our hope, and, under the earth, in the graveyard,"
58173,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Then it is good to pray unto God; for his sorrowiug children
58174,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Turns he ne'er from his door, but he heals and helps and consoles them,"
58175,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Yet is it better to pray when all things are prosperous with us,"
58176,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Pray in fortunate days, for life's most beautiful Fortune"

58179,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Or do ye know, ye children, one blessing that comes not from Heaven?"
58180,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"What has mankind forsooth, the poor! that it has not received?"
58181,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Therefore, fall in the dust and pray! The seraphs adoring"
58182,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Cover with pinions six their face in the glory of him who
58183,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hung his masonry pendent on naught, when the world be created."
58184,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Earth declareth his might, and the firmament utters his glory."

58190,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hillocks skip like the kid, and mountains leap like the roebuck."
58191,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Yet,--why are ye afraid, ye children? This awful avenger,"
58192,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Ah! is a merciful God! God's voice was not in the earthquake,"
58193,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Not in the fire, nor the storm, but it was in the whispering breezes."
58194,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Love is the root of creation; God's essence; worlds without number
58195,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Lie in his bosom like children; he made them for this purpose only.
58196,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Only to love and to be loved again, he breathed forth his spirit"
58197,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Into the slumbering dust, and upright standing, it laid its"
58198,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hand on its heart, and felt it was warm with a flame out of heaven."
58199,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Quench, oh quench not that flame! It is the breath of your being."
58200,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Love is life, but hatred is death. Not father, nor mother"
58201,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Loved you, as God has loved you; for 't was that you may be happy"
58202,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Gave he his only Son. When he bowed down his head in the death-hour
58203,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Solemnized Love its triumph; the sacrifice then was completed.

58205,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Earth and heaven apart, and the dead from their sepulchres rising"
58206,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Whispered with pallid lips and low in the ears of each other
58207,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Th' answer, but dreamed of before, to creation's enigma,--Atonement!"
58208,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Depths of Love are Atonement's depths, for Love is Atonement."
58209,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Therefore, child of mortality, love thou the merciful Father;"
58210,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Wish what the Holy One wishes, and not from fear, but affection"
58211,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Fear is the virtue of slaves; but the heart that loveth is willing
58212,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Perfect was before God, and perfect is Love, and Love only."
58213,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Lovest thou God as thou oughtest, then lovest thou likewise thy brethren:"
58214,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"One is the sun in heaven, and one, only one, is Love also."
58215,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Bears not each human figure the godlike stamp on his forehead
58216,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Readest thou not in his face thou origin? Is he not sailing
58217,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Lost like thyself on an ocean unknown, and is he not guided"
58218,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,By the same stars that guide thee? Why shouldst thou hate then thy brother?
58219,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hateth he thee, forgive! For 't is sweet to stammer one letter"
58220,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Of the Eternal's language;--on earth it is called Forgiveness!
58221,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Knowest thou Him, who forgave, with the crown of thorns on his temples?"
58222,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Earnestly prayed for his foes, for his murderers? Say, dost thou know him?"
58223,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Ah! thou confessest his name, so follow likewise his example,"
58224,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Think of thy brother no ill, but throw a veil over his failings,"
58225,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Guide the erring aright; for the good, the heavenly shepherd"
58226,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Took the lost lamb in his arms, and bore it back to its mother."
58227,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"This is the fruit of Love, and it is by its fruits that we know it."
58228,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Love is the creature's welfare, with God; but Love among mortals"
58229,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Is but an endless sigh! He longs, and endures, and stands waiting,"
58230,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Suffers and yet rejoices, and smiles with tears on his eyelids."
58231,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hope,--so is called upon earth, his recompense, Hope, the befriending,"
58232,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Does what she can, for she points evermore up to heaven, and faithful"
58233,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Plunges her anchor's peak in the depths of the grave, and beneath it"
58234,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Paints a more beautiful world, a dim, but a sweet play of shadows!"
58235,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Races, better than we, have leaned on her wavering promise,"
58236,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Having naught else but Hope. Then praise we our Father in heaven,"
58237,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Him, who has given us more; for to us has Hope been transfigured,"
58238,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Groping no longer in night; she is Faith, she is living assurance."
58239,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Faith is enlightened Hope; she is light, is the eye of affection,"
58240,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Dreams of the longing interprets, and carves their visions in marble."
58241,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Faith is the sun of life; and her countenance shines like the Hebrew's,"
58242,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,For she has looked upon God; the heaven on its stable foundation
58243,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Draws she with chains down to earth, and the New Jerusalem sinketh"
58244,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Splendid with portals twelve in golden vapors descending.
58245,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"There enraptured she wanders. and looks at the figures majestic,"
58246,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Fears not the winged crowd, in the midst of them all is her homestead."
58247,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Therefore love and believe; for works will follow spontaneous
58248,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Even as day does the sun; the Right from the Good is an offspring,"
58249,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Love in a bodily shape; and Christian works are no more than
58250,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Animate Love and faith, as flowers are the animate Springtide."
58251,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Works do follow us all unto God; there stand and bear witness
58252,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Not what they seemed,--but what they were only. Blessed is he who"
58253,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Hears their confession secure; they are mute upon earth until death's hand
58254,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Opens the mouth of the silent. Ye children, does Death e'er alarm you?"
58255,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Death is the brother of Love, twin-brother is he, and is only"
58256,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,More austere to behold. With a kiss upon lips that are fading
58257,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Takes he the soul and departs, and, rocked in the arms of affection,"
58258,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Places the ransomed child, new born, 'fore the face of its father."
58259,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Sounds of his coming already I hear,--see dimly his pinions,"
58260,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Swart as the night, but with stars strewn upon them! I fear not before him."
58261,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Death is only release, and in mercy is mute. On his bosom"
58262,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Freer breathes, in its coolness, my breast; and face to face standing"
58263,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Look I on God as he is, a sun unpolluted by vapors;"
58264,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Look on the light of the ages I loved, the spirits majestic,"
58265,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Nobler, better than I; they stand by the throne all transfigured,"
58266,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Vested in white, and with harps of gold, and are singing an anthem,"
58267,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Writ in the climate of heaven, in the language spoken by angels."

58271,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Wander from holiness onward to holiness; earth shall ye heed not
58272,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Earth is but dust and heaven is light; I have pledged you to heaven.
58273,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"God of the universe, hear me! thou fountain of Love everlasting,"
58274,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Hark to the voice of thy servant! I send up my prayer to thy heaven!
58275,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Let me hereafter not miss at thy throne one spirit of all these,"
58276,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Whom thou hast given me here! I have loved them all like a father.
58277,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"May they bear witness for me, that I taught them the way of salvation,"
58278,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Faithful, so far as I knew, of thy word; again may they know me,"
58279,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Fall on their Teacher's breast, and before thy face may I place them,"
58280,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Pure as they now are, but only more tried, and exclaiming with gladness,"
58281,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Father, lo! I am here, and the children, whom thou hast given me!"""
58282,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58283,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Weeping he spake in these words; and now at the beck of the old man
58284,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Knee against knee they knitted a wreath round the altar's enclosure.
58285,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Kneeling he read then the prayers of the consecration, and softly"
58286,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"With him the children read; at the close, with tremulous accents,"
58287,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Asked he the peace of Heaven, a benediction upon them."
58288,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Now should have ended his task for the day; the following Sunday
58289,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Was for the young appointed to eat of the Lord's holy Supper.
58290,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Sudden, as struck from the clouds, stood the Teacher silent and laid his"
58291,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hand on his forehead, and cast his looks upward; while thoughts high and holy,"
58292,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Flew through the midst of his soul, and his eyes glanced with wonderful brightness."
58293,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"""On the next Sunday, who knows! perhaps I shall rest in the graveyard!"
58294,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Some one perhaps of yourselves, a lily broken untimely,"
58295,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Bow down his head to the earth; why delay I? the hour is accomplished,"
58296,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Warm is the heart;--I will! for to-day grows the harvest of heaven.
58297,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,What I began accomplish I now; what failing therein is
58298,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"I, the old man, will answer to God and the reverend father."
58299,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Say to me only, ye children, ye denizens new-come in heaven,"
58300,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Are ye ready this day to eat of the bread of Atonement?
58301,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"What it denoteth, that know ye full well, I have told it you often."
58302,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Of the new covenant symbol it is, of Atonement a token,"
58303,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Stablished between earth and heaven. Man by his sins and transgressions
58304,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Far has wandered from God, from his essence. 'T was in the beginning"
58305,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Fast by the Tree of Knowledge he fell, and it hangs its crown o'er the"
58306,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Fall to this day; in the Thought is the Fall; in the Heart the Atonement.
58307,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Infinite is the fall,--the Atonement infinite likewise."
58308,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"See! behind me, as far as the old man remembers, and forward,"
58309,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Far as Hope in her flight can reach with her wearied pinions,"
58310,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Sin and Atonement incessant go through the lifetime of mortals.
58311,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Sin is brought forth full-grown; but Atonement sleeps in our bosoms
58312,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Still as the cradled babe; and dreams of heaven and of angels,"
58313,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Cannot awake to sensation; is like the tones in the harp's strings,"
58314,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Spirits imprisoned, that wait evermore the deliverer's finger."
58315,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Therefore, ye children beloved, descended the Prince of Atonement,"
58316,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Woke the slumberer from sleep, and she stands now with eyes all resplendent."
58317,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Bright as the vault of the sky, and battles with Sin and o'ercomes her."
58318,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Downward to earth he came and, transfigured, thence reascended,"
58319,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Not from the heart in like wise, for there he still lives in the Spirit,"
58320,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Loves and atones evermore. So long as Time is, is Atonement."
58321,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Therefore with reverence take this day her visible token.
58322,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Tokens are dead if the things live not. The light everlasting
58323,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Unto the blind is not, but is born of the eye that has vision."
58324,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Neither in bread nor in wine, but in the heart that is hallowed"
58325,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Lieth forgiveness enshrined; the intention alone of amendment
58326,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Fruits of the earth ennobles to heavenly things, and removes all"
58327,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Sin and the guerdon of sin. Only Love with his arms wide extended,"
58328,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Penitence wee ping and praying; the Will that is tried, and whose gold flows"
58329,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Purified forth from the flames; in a word, mankind by Atonement"
58330,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Breaketh Atonement's bread, and drinketh Atonement's wine-cup."
58331,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"But he who cometh up hither, unworthy, with hate in his bosom,"
58332,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Scoffing at men and at God, is guilty of Christ's blessed body,"
58333,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,And the Redeemer's blood! To himself he eateth and drinketh
58334,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Death and doom! And from this, preserve us, thou heavenly Father!"
58335,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Are ye ready, ye children, to eat of the bread of Atonement?"""
58336,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Thus with emotion he asked, and together answered the children,"
58337,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"""Yes!"" with deep sobs interrupted. Then read he the due supplications,"
58338,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Read the Form of Communion, and in chimed the organ and anthem:"
58339,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"""O Holy Lamb of God, who takest away our transgressions,"
58340,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Hear us! give us thy peace! have mercy, have mercy upon us!"""
58341,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Th' old man, with trembling hand, and heavenly pearls on his eyelids,"
58342,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Filled now the chalice and paten, and dealt round the mystical symbols."
58343,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Oh, then seemed it to me as if God, with the broad eye of midday,"
58344,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Clearer looked in at the windows, and all the trees in the church yard"
58345,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Bowed down their summits of green, and the grass on the graves 'gan to shiver"
58346,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,But in the children (I noted it well; I knew it) there ran a
58347,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,Tremor of holy rapture along through their ice-cold members.
58348,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Decked like an altar before them, there stood the green earth, and above it"
58349,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Heaven opened itself, as of old before Stephen; they saw there"
58350,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Radiant in glory the Father, and on his right hand the Redeemer."
58351,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Under them hear they the clang of harpstrings, and angels from gold clouds"
58352,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Beckon to them like brothers, and fan with their pinions of purple."
58353,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,
58354,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Closed was the Teacher's task, and with heaven in their hearts and their faces,"
58355,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Up rose the children all, and each bowed him, weeping full sorely,"
58356,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Downward to kiss that reverend hand, but all of them pressed he"
58357,BY ESAIAS TEGNÉR,"Moved to his bosom, and laid, with a prayer, his hands full of blessings,"

59932,I,So fair a bride shall leave her home!
59933,I,"Should blossom and bloom with garlands gay,"
59934,I,So fair a bride shall pass to-day!
59935,I,
59936,I,"It is Baptiste, and his affianced maiden,"
59937,I,With garlands for the bridal laden!
59938,I,
59939,I,"The sky was blue; without one cloud of gloom,"
59940,I,"The sun of March was shining brightly,"
59941,I,And to the air the freshening wind gave lightly
59942,I,Its breathings of perfume.
59943,I,
59944,I,"When one beholds the dusky hedges blossom,"
59945,I,"A rustic bridal, oh! how sweet it is!"
59946,I,"To sounds of joyous melodies,"
59947,I,"That touch with tenderness the trembling bosom,"
59948,I,A band of maidens
59949,I,"Gayly frolicking,"
59950,I,A band of youngsters
59951,I,Wildly rollicking!
59952,I,"Kissing,"
59953,I,"Caressing,"
59954,I,"With fingers pressing,"
59955,I,Till in the veriest
59956,I,"Madness of mirth, as they dance,"
59957,I,"They retreat and advance,"
59958,I,Trying whose laugh shall be loudest and merriest;
59959,I,"While the bride, with roguish eyes,"
59960,I,"Sporting with them, now escapes and cries:"
59961,I,"""Those who catch me"
59962,I,Married verily
59963,I,"This year shall be!"""
59964,I,
59965,I,"And all pursue with eager haste,"
59966,I,"And all attain what they pursue,"
59967,I,"And  touch her pretty apron fresh and new,"
59968,I,And the linen kirtle round her waist.
59969,I,
59970,I,"Meanwhile, whence comes it that among"
59971,I,"These youthful maidens fresh and fair,"
59972,I,"So joyous, with such laughing air,"
59973,I,"Baptiste stands sighing, with silent tongue?"
59974,I,And yet the bride is fair and young!
59975,I,"Is it Saint Joseph would say to us all,"
59976,I,"That love, o'er-hasty, precedeth a fall?"
59977,I,"O no! for a maiden frail, I trow,"
59978,I,Never bore so lofty a brow!
59979,I,What lovers! they give not a single caress!
59980,I,"To see them so careless and cold to-day,"
59981,I,"These are grand people, one would say."
59982,I,What ails Baptiste? what grief doth him oppress?
59983,I,
59984,I,"It is, that half-way up the hill,"
59985,I,"In yon cottage, by whose walls"
59986,I,"Stand the cart-house and the stalls,"
59987,I,"Dwelleth the blind orphan still,"
59988,I,Daughter of a veteran old;
59989,I,"And you must know, one year ago,"
59990,I,"That Margaret, the young and tender,"
59991,I,"Was the village pride and splendor,"
59992,I,And Baptiste her lover bold.
59993,I,"Love, the deceiver, them ensnared;"
59994,I,For them the altar was prepared;
59995,I,"But alas! the summer's blight,"
59996,I,"The dread disease that none can stay,"
59997,I,"The pestilence that walks by night,"
59998,I,Took the young bride's sight away.
59999,I,
60000,I,All at the father's stern command was changed;
60001,I,"Their peace was gone, but not their love estranged."
60002,I,"Wearied at home, erelong the lover fled;"
60003,I,"Returned but three short days ago,"
60004,I,"The golden chain they round him throw,"
60005,I,"He is enticed, and onward led"
60006,I,"To marry Angela, and yet"
60007,I,Is thinking ever of Margaret.
60008,I,
60009,I,"Then suddenly a maiden cried,"
60010,I,"""Anna, Theresa, Mary, Kate!"
60011,I,"Here comes the cripple Jane!""  And by a fountain's side"
60012,I,"A woman, bent and gray with years,"
60013,I,"Under the mulberry-trees appears,"
60014,I,"And all towards her run, as fleet"
60015,I,As had they wings upon their feet.
60016,I,
60017,I,"It is that Jane, the cripple Jane,"
60018,I,"Is a soothsayer, wary and kind."
60019,I,"She telleth fortunes, and none complain."
60020,I,"She promises one a village swain,"
60021,I,"Another a happy wedding-day,"
60022,I,And the bride a lovely boy straightway.
60023,I,All comes to pass as she avers;
60024,I,"She never deceives, she never errs."
60025,I,
60026,I,But for this once the village seer
60027,I,"Wears a countenance severe,"
60028,I,And from beneath her eyebrows thin and white
60029,I,Her two eyes flash like cannons bright
60030,I,"Aimed at the bridegroom in waistcoat blue,"
60031,I,"Who, like a statue, stands in view;"
60032,I,"Changing color as well he might,"
60033,I,When the beldame wrinkled and gray
60034,I,"Takes the young bride by the hand,"
60035,I,"And, with the tip of her reedy wand"
60036,I,"Making the sign of the cross, doth say:--"
60037,I,"""Thoughtless Angela, beware!"
60038,I,"Lest, when thou weddest this false bridegroom,"
60039,I,"Thou diggest for thyself a tomb!"""
60040,I,And she was silent; and the maidens fair
60041,I,Saw from each eye escape a swollen tear;
60042,I,"But on a little streamlet silver-clear,"
60043,I,What are two drops of turbid rain?
60044,I,"Saddened a moment, the bridal train"
60045,I,Resumed the dance and song again;
60046,I,The bridegroom only was pale with fear;--
60047,I,And down green alleys
60048,I,"Of verdurous valleys,"
60049,I,"With merry sallies,"
60050,I,They sang the refrain:--
60051,I,
60052,I,"""The roads should blossom, the roads should bloom,"
60053,I,So fair a bride shall leave her home!
60054,I,"Should blossom and bloom with garlands gay,"
60055,I,"So fair a bride shall pass to-day!"""
60056,I,
60057,I,
60058,II,II
60059,II,
60060,II,"And by suffering worn and weary,"
60061,II,"But beautiful as some fair angel yet,"
60062,II,"Thus lamented Margaret,"
60063,II,In her cottage lone and dreary;--
60064,II,
60065,II,"""He has arrived! arrived at last!"
60066,II,Yet Jane has named him not these three days past;
60067,II,Arrived! yet keeps aloof so far!
60068,II,And knows that of my night he is the star!
60069,II,"Knows that long months I wait alone, benighted,"
60070,II,And count the moments since he went away!
60071,II,"Come! keep the promise of that happier day,"
60072,II,That I may keep the faith to thee I plighted!
60073,II,What joy have I without thee? what delight?
60074,II,"Grief wastes my life, and makes it misery;"
60075,II,"Day for the others ever, but for me"
60076,II,Forever night! forever night!
60077,II,When he is gone 't is dark! my soul is sad!
60078,II,"I suffer! O my God! come, make me glad."
60079,II,"When he is near, no thoughts of day intrude;"
60080,II,"Day has blue heavens, but Baptiste has blue eyes!"
60081,II,"Within them shines for me a heaven of love,"
60082,II,"A heaven all happiness, like that above,"
60083,II,No more of grief! no more of lassitude!
60084,II,"Earth I forget,--and heaven, and all distresses,"
60085,II,When seated by my side my hand he presses;
60086,II,"But when alone, remember all!"
60087,II,Where is Baptiste? he hears not when I call!
60088,II,"A branch of ivy, dying on the ground,"
60089,II,I need some bough to twine around!
60090,II,In pity come! be to my suffering kind!
60091,II,"True love, they say, in grief doth more abound!"
60092,II,What then--when one is blind?
60093,II,
60094,II,"""Who knows? perhaps I am forsaken!"
60095,II,Ah! woe is me! then bear me to my grave!
60096,II,O God! what thoughts within me waken!
60097,II,Away! he will return!  I do but rave!
60098,II,He will return!  I need not fear!
60099,II,He swore it by our Saviour dear;
60100,II,He could not come at his own will;
60101,II,"Is weary, or perhaps is ill!"
60102,II,"Perhaps his heart, in this disguise,"
60103,II,Prepares for me some sweet surprise!
60104,II,"But some one comes!  Though blind, my heart can see!"
60105,II,"And that deceives me not! 't is he! 't is he!"""
60106,II,
60107,II,"And the door ajar is set,"
60108,II,"And poor, confiding Margaret"
60109,II,"Rises, with outstretched arms, but sightless eyes;"
60110,II,"'T is only Paul, her brother, who thus cries:--"
60111,II,"""Angela the bride has passed!"
60112,II,I saw the wedding guests go by;
60113,II,"Tell me, my sister, why were we not asked?"
60114,II,"For all are there but you and I!"""
60115,II,
60116,II,"""Angela married! and not send"
60117,II,To tell her secret unto me!
60118,II,"O, speak! who may the bridegroom be?"""
60119,II,"""My sister, 't is Baptiste, thy friend!"""
60120,II,
60121,II,"A cry the blind girl gave, but nothing said;"
60122,II,A milky whiteness spreads upon her cheeks;
60123,II,"An icy hand, as heavy as lead,"
60124,II,"Descending, as her brother speaks,"
60125,II,"Upon her heart, that has ceased to beat,"
60126,II,Suspends awhile its life and heat.
60127,II,"She stands beside the boy, now sore distressed,"
60128,II,A wax Madonna as a peasant dressed.
60129,II,
60130,II,"At length, the bridal song again"
60131,II,Brings her back to her sorrow and pain.
60132,II,
60133,II,"""Hark! the joyous airs are ringing!"
60134,II,"Sister, dost thou hear them singing?"
60135,II,How merrily they laugh and jest!
60136,II,Would we were bidden with the rest!
60137,II,"I would don my hose of homespun gray,"
60138,II,And my doublet of linen striped and gay;
60139,II,Perhaps they will come; for they do not wed
60140,II,"Till to-morrow at seven o'clock, it is said!"""
60141,II,
60142,II,"""I know it!"" answered Margaret;"
60143,II,"Whom the vision, with aspect black as jet,"
60144,II,Mastered again; and its hand of ice
60145,II,"Held her heart crushed, as in a vice!"
60146,II,"""Paul, be not sad!  'T is a holiday;"
60147,II,To-morrow put on thy doublet gay!
60148,II,"But leave me now for a while alone."""
60149,II,"Away, with a hop and a jump, went Paul,"
60150,II,"And, as he whistled along the hall,"
60151,II,"Entered Jane, the crippled crone."
60152,II,
60153,II,"""Holy Virgin! what dreadful heat!"
60154,II,"I am faint, and weary, and out of breath!"
60155,II,"But thou art cold,--art chill as death;"
60156,II,"My little friend! what ails thee, sweet?"""
60157,II,"""Nothing!  I heard them singing home the bride;"
60158,II,"And, as I listened to the song,"
60159,II,"I thought my turn would come erelong,"
60160,II,Thou knowest it is at Whitsuntide.
60161,II,"Thy cards forsooth can never lie,"
60162,II,"To me such joy they prophesy,"
60163,II,Thy skill shall be vaunted far and wide
60164,II,When they behold him at my side.
60165,II,"And poor Baptiste, what sayest thou?"
60166,II,"It must seem long to him;--methinks I see him now!"""
60167,II,"Jane, shuddering, her hand doth press:"
60168,II,"""Thy love I cannot all approve;"
60169,II,We must not trust too much to happiness;--
60170,II,"Go, pray to God, that thou mayst love him less!"""
60171,II,"""The more I pray, the more I love!"
60172,II,"It is no sin, for God is on my side!"""
60173,II,It was enough; and Jane no more replied.
60174,II,
60175,II,Now to all hope her heart is barred and cold;
60176,II,But to deceive the beldame old
60177,II,"She takes a sweet, contented air;"
60178,II,"Speak of foul weather or of fair,"
60179,II,At every word the maiden smiles!
60180,II,Thus the beguiler she beguiles;
60181,II,"So that, departing at the evening's close,"
60182,II,"She says, ""She may be saved! she nothing knows!"""
60183,II,
60184,II,"Poor Jane, the cunning sorceress!"
60185,II,"Now that thou wouldst, thou art no prophetess!"
60186,II,"This morning, in the fulness of thy heart,"
60187,II,"Thou wast so, far beyond thine art!"
60188,II,
60189,II,
60190,III,III
60191,III,
60192,III,"Now rings the bell, nine times reverberating,"
60193,III,"And the white daybreak, stealing up the sky,"
60194,III,"Sees in two cottages two maidens waiting,"
60195,III,How differently!
60196,III,
60197,III,"Queen of a day, by flatterers caressed,"
60198,III,"The one puts on her cross and crown,"
60199,III,"Decks with a huge bouquet her breast,"
60200,III,"And flaunting, fluttering up and down,"
60201,III,"Looks at herself, and cannot rest,"
60202,III,"The other, blind, within her little room,"
60203,III,Has neither crown nor flower's perfume;
60204,III,"But in their stead for something gropes apart,"
60205,III,"That in a drawer's recess doth lie,"
60206,III,"And, 'neath her bodice of bright scarlet dye,"
60207,III,Convulsive clasps it to her heart.
60208,III,
60209,III,"The one, fantastic, light as air,"
60210,III,"'Mid kisses ringing,"
60211,III,"And joyous singing,"
60212,III,Forgets to say her morning prayer!
60213,III,
60214,III,"The other, with cold drops upon her brow,"
60215,III,"Joins her two hands, and kneels upon the floor,"
60216,III,"And whispers, as her brother opes the door,"
60217,III,"""O God! forgive me now!"""
60218,III,
60219,III,"And then the orphan, young and blind,"
60220,III,"Conducted by her brother's hand,"
60221,III,"Towards the church, through paths unscanned,"
60222,III,"With tranquil air, her way doth wind."
60223,III,"Odors of laurel, making her faint and pale,"
60224,III,"Round her at times exhale,"
60225,III,"And  in the sky as yet no sunny ray,"
60226,III,But brumal vapors gray.
60227,III,
60228,III,"Near that castle, fair to see,"
60229,III,"Crowded with sculptures old, in every part,"
60230,III,"Marvels of nature and of art,"
60231,III,"And proud of its name of high degree,"
60232,III,"A little chapel, almost bare"
60233,III,"At the base of the rock, is builded there;"
60234,III,"All glorious that it lifts aloof,"
60235,III,"Above each jealous cottage roof,"
60236,III,"Its sacred summit, swept by autumn gales,"
60237,III,"And its blackened steeple high in air,"
60238,III,Round which the osprey screams and sails.
60239,III,
60240,III,"""Paul, lay thy noisy rattle by!"""
60241,III,"Thus Margaret said.  ""Where are we? we ascend!"""
60242,III,"""Yes; seest thou not our journey's end?"
60243,III,Hearest not the osprey from the belfry cry?
60244,III,"The hideous bird, that brings ill luck, we know!"
60245,III,"Dost thou remember when our father said,"
60246,III,"The night we watched beside his bed,"
60247,III,"'O daughter, I am weak and low;"
60248,III,Take care of Paul; I feel that I am dying!'
60249,III,"And thou, and he, and I, all fell to crying?"
60250,III,Then on the roof the osprey screamed aloud;
60251,III,And here they brought our father in his shroud.
60252,III,There is his grave; there stands the cross we set;
60253,III,"Why dost thou clasp me so, dear Margaret?"
60254,III,Come in!  The bride will be here soon:
60255,III,"Thou tremblest!  O my God! thou art going to swoon!"""
60256,III,
60257,III,"She could no more,--the blind girl, weak and weary!"
60258,III,"A voice seemed crying from that grave so dreary,"
60259,III,"""What wouldst thou do, my daughter?""--and she started,"
60260,III,"And quick recoiled, aghast, faint-hearted;"
60261,III,"But Paul, impatient, urges evermore"
60262,III,Her steps towards the open door;
60263,III,"And when, beneath her feet, the unhappy maid"
60264,III,"Crushes the laurel near the house immortal,"
60265,III,"And with her head, as Paul talks on again,"
60266,III,Touches the crown of filigrane
60267,III,"Suspended from the low-arched portal,"
60268,III,"No more restrained, no more afraid,"
60269,III,"She walks, as for a feast arrayed,"
60270,III,And in the ancient chapel's sombre night
60271,III,They both are lost to sight.
60272,III,
60273,III,"At length the bell,"
60274,III,"With booming sound,"
60275,III,"Sends forth, resounding round."
60276,III,Its hymeneal peal o'er rock and down the dell.
60277,III,"It is broad day, with sunshine and with rain;"
60278,III,"And yet the guests delay not long,"
60279,III,"For soon arrives the bridal train,"
60280,III,And with it brings the village throng.
60281,III,
60282,III,"In sooth, deceit maketh no mortal gay,"
60283,III,"For lo! Baptiste on this triumphant day,"
60284,III,"Mute as an idiot, sad as yester-morning,"
60285,III,Thinks only of the beldame's words of warning.
60286,III,
60287,III,"And Angela thinks of her cross, I wis;"
60288,III,To be a bride is all!  The pretty lisper
60289,III,"Feels her heart swell to hear all round her whisper,"
60290,III,"""How beautiful! how beautiful she is!""."
60291,III,
60292,III,"But she must calm that giddy head,"
60293,III,For already the Mass is said;
60294,III,At the holy table stands the priest;
60295,III,The wedding ring is blessed; Baptiste receives it;
60296,III,"Ere on the finger of the bride he leaves it,"
60297,III,He must pronounce one word at least!
60298,III,'T is spoken; and sudden at the grooms-man's side
60299,III,"""'T is he!"" a well-known voice has cried."
60300,III,"And while the wedding guests all hold their breath,"
60301,III,"Opes the confessional, and the blind girl, see!"
60302,III,"""Baptiste,"" she said, ""since thou hast wished my death,"
60303,III,"As holy water be my blood for thee!"""
60304,III,And calmly in the air a knife suspended!
60305,III,"Doubtless her guardian angel near attended,"
60306,III,"For anguish did its work so well,"
60307,III,"That, ere the fatal stroke descended,"
60308,III,Lifeless she fell!
60309,III,
60310,III,"At eve instead of bridal verse,"
60311,III,The De Profundis filled the air;
60312,III,Decked with flowers a simple hearse
60313,III,To the churchyard forth they bear;
60314,III,Village girls in robes of snow
60315,III,"Follow, weeping as they go;"
60316,III,"Nowhere was a smile that day,"
60317,III,"No, ah no! for each one seemed to say:--"
60318,III,
60319,III,"""The road should mourn and be veiled in gloom,"
60320,III,So fair a corpse shall leave its home!
60321,III,"Should mourn and should weep, ah, well-away!"
60322,III,"So fair a corpse shall pass to-day!"""
