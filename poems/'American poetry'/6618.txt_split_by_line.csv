88,A GOOD SPORT,
89,A GOOD SPORT,
90,A GOOD SPORT,"I WAS a little lad, and the older boys called to me from the pier:"
91,A GOOD SPORT,They called to me: ‘Be a sport: be a sport!  Leap in and swim!’
92,A GOOD SPORT,"I leaped in and swam, though I had never been taught a stroke."
93,A GOOD SPORT,"Then I was made a hero, and they all shouted:"
94,A GOOD SPORT,"‘Well done!  Well done,"
95,A GOOD SPORT,"Brave boy, you are a sport, a good sport!’"
96,A GOOD SPORT,And I was very glad.
97,A GOOD SPORT,
98,A GOOD SPORT,"But now I wish I had learned to swim the right way,"
99,A GOOD SPORT,Or had never learned at all.
100,A GOOD SPORT,"Now I regret that day,"
101,A GOOD SPORT,For it led to my fall.
102,A GOOD SPORT,
103,A GOOD SPORT,"I was a youth, and I heard the older men talking of the road to"
104,A GOOD SPORT,wealth;
105,A GOOD SPORT,"They talked of bulls and bears, of buying on margins,"
106,A GOOD SPORT,"And they said, ‘Be a sport, my boy, plunge in and win or lose it all!"
107,A GOOD SPORT,It is the only way to fortune.’
108,A GOOD SPORT,"So I plunged in and won; and the older men patted me on the back,"
109,A GOOD SPORT,"And they said, ‘You are a sport, my boy, a good sport!’"
110,A GOOD SPORT,And I was very glad.
111,A GOOD SPORT,
112,A GOOD SPORT,But now I wish I had lost all I ventured on that day—
113,A GOOD SPORT,"Yes, wish I had lost it all."
114,A GOOD SPORT,"For it was the wrong way,"
115,A GOOD SPORT,And pushed me to my fall.
116,A GOOD SPORT,
117,A GOOD SPORT,"I was a young man, and the gay world called me to come;"
118,A GOOD SPORT,"Gay women and gay men called to me, crying:"
119,A GOOD SPORT,‘Be a sport; be a good sport!
120,A GOOD SPORT,Fill our glasses and let us fill yours.
121,A GOOD SPORT,"We are young but once; let us dance and sing,"
122,A GOOD SPORT,And drive the dull hours of night until they stand at bay
123,A GOOD SPORT,Against the shining bayonets of day.’
124,A GOOD SPORT,"So I filled my glass, and I filled their glasses, over and over again,"
125,A GOOD SPORT,"And I sang and danced and drank, and drank and danced and sang,"
126,A GOOD SPORT,"And I heard them cry, ‘He is a sport, a good sport!’"
127,A GOOD SPORT,As they held their glasses out to be filled again.
128,A GOOD SPORT,And I was very glad.
129,A GOOD SPORT,
130,A GOOD SPORT,"Oh the madness of youth and song and dance and wine,"
131,A GOOD SPORT,"Of woman’s eyes and lips, when the night dies in the arms of dawn!"
132,A GOOD SPORT,And now I wish I had not gone that way.
133,A GOOD SPORT,"Now I wish I had not heard them say,"
134,A GOOD SPORT,"‘He is a sport, a good sport!’"
135,A GOOD SPORT,For I am old who should be young.
136,A GOOD SPORT,The splendid vigour of my youth I flung
137,A GOOD SPORT,"Under the feet of a mad, unthinking throng."
138,A GOOD SPORT,My strength went out with wine and dance and song;
139,A GOOD SPORT,"Unto the winds of earth I tossed like chaff,"
140,A GOOD SPORT,"With idle jest and laugh,"
141,A GOOD SPORT,"The pride of splendid manhood, all its wealth"
142,A GOOD SPORT,Of unused power and health—
143,A GOOD SPORT,Its dream of looking into some pure girl’s eyes
144,A GOOD SPORT,And finding there its earthly paradise—
145,A GOOD SPORT,Its hope of virile children free from blight—
146,A GOOD SPORT,Its thoughts of climbing to some noble height
147,A GOOD SPORT,Of great achievement—all these gifts divine
148,A GOOD SPORT,I cast away for song and dance and wine.
149,A GOOD SPORT,"Oh, I have been a sport, a good sport;"
150,A GOOD SPORT,But I am very sad.

155,A SON SPEAKS,A SON SPEAKS
156,A SON SPEAKS,
157,A SON SPEAKS,
158,A SON SPEAKS,"MOTHER, sit down, for I have much to say"
159,A SON SPEAKS,Anent this widespread ever-growing theme
160,A SON SPEAKS,Of woman and her virtues and her rights.
161,A SON SPEAKS,
162,A SON SPEAKS,"I left you for the large, loud world of men,"
163,A SON SPEAKS,When I had lived one little score of years.
164,A SON SPEAKS,"I judged all women by you, and my heart"
165,A SON SPEAKS,Was filled with high esteem and reverence
166,A SON SPEAKS,"For your angelic sex; and for the wives,"
167,A SON SPEAKS,"The sisters, daughters, mothers of my friends"
168,A SON SPEAKS,I held but holy thoughts.  To fallen stars
169,A SON SPEAKS,"(Of whom you told me in our last sweet talk,"
170,A SON SPEAKS,Warning me of the dangers in my path)
171,A SON SPEAKS,"I gave wide pity as you bade me to,"
172,A SON SPEAKS,Saying their sins harked back to my base sex.
173,A SON SPEAKS,
174,A SON SPEAKS,"Now listen, mother mine: Ten years have passed"
175,A SON SPEAKS,"Since that clean-minded and pure-bodied youth,"
176,A SON SPEAKS,"Thinking to write his name upon the stars,"
177,A SON SPEAKS,Went from your presence.  He returns to you
178,A SON SPEAKS,"Fallen from his altitude of thought,"
179,A SON SPEAKS,"Hiding deep scars of sins upon his soul,"
180,A SON SPEAKS,His fair illusions shattered and destroyed.
181,A SON SPEAKS,And would you know the story of his fall?
182,A SON SPEAKS,
183,A SON SPEAKS,He sat beside a good man’s honoured wife
184,A SON SPEAKS,At her own table.  She was beautiful
185,A SON SPEAKS,As woods in early autumn.  Full of soft
186,A SON SPEAKS,And subtle witcheries of voice and look—
187,A SON SPEAKS,"His senior, both in knowledge and in years."
188,A SON SPEAKS,
189,A SON SPEAKS,The boyish admiration of his glance
190,A SON SPEAKS,Was white as April sunlight when it falls
191,A SON SPEAKS,"Upon a blooming tree, until she leaned"
192,A SON SPEAKS,So close her rounded body sent quick thrills
193,A SON SPEAKS,"Along his nerves.  He thought it accident,"
194,A SON SPEAKS,And moved a little; soon she leaned again.
195,A SON SPEAKS,The half-hid beauties of her heaving breast
196,A SON SPEAKS,"Rising and falling under scented lace,"
197,A SON SPEAKS,"The teasing tendrils of her fragrant hair,"
198,A SON SPEAKS,"With intermittent touches on his cheek,"
199,A SON SPEAKS,Changed the boy’s interest to a man’s desire.
200,A SON SPEAKS,She saw that first young madness in his eyes
201,A SON SPEAKS,And smiled and fanned the flame.  That was his fall;
202,A SON SPEAKS,And as some mangled fly may crawl away
203,A SON SPEAKS,"And leave his wings behind him in the web,"
204,A SON SPEAKS,So were his wings of faith in womanhood
205,A SON SPEAKS,Left in the meshes of her sensuous net.
206,A SON SPEAKS,
207,A SON SPEAKS,"The youth, forced into sudden manhood, went"
208,A SON SPEAKS,Seeking the lost ideal of his dreams.
209,A SON SPEAKS,"He met, in churches and in drawing-rooms,"
210,A SON SPEAKS,Women who wore the mask of innocence
211,A SON SPEAKS,"And basked in public favour, yet who seemed"
212,A SON SPEAKS,"To find their pleasure playing with men’s hearts,"
213,A SON SPEAKS,As children play with loaded guns.  He heard
214,A SON SPEAKS,(Until the tale fell dull upon his ears)
215,A SON SPEAKS,The unsolicited complaints of wives
216,A SON SPEAKS,"And mothers all unsatisfied with life,"
217,A SON SPEAKS,While crowned with every blessing earth can give
218,A SON SPEAKS,"Longing for God knows what to bring content,"
219,A SON SPEAKS,And openly or with appealing look
220,A SON SPEAKS,Asking for sympathy.  (The first blind step
221,A SON SPEAKS,"That leads from wifely honour down to shame,"
222,A SON SPEAKS,Is ofttimes hid with flowers of sympathy.)
223,A SON SPEAKS,
224,A SON SPEAKS,He saw proud women who would flush and pale
225,A SON SPEAKS,With sense of outraged modesty if one
226,A SON SPEAKS,"Spoke of the ancient sin before them, bare"
227,A SON SPEAKS,"To all men’s sight, or flimsily conceal"
228,A SON SPEAKS,"By veils that bid adventurous eyes proceed,"
229,A SON SPEAKS,Charms meant alone for lover and for child.
230,A SON SPEAKS,"He saw chaste virgins tempt and tantalise,"
231,A SON SPEAKS,"Lure and deny, invite—and then refuse,"
232,A SON SPEAKS,And drive men forth half crazed to wantons’ arms.
233,A SON SPEAKS,
234,A SON SPEAKS,"Mother, you taught me there were but two kinds"
235,A SON SPEAKS,Of women in the world—the good and bad.
236,A SON SPEAKS,"But you have been too sheltered in the safe,"
237,A SON SPEAKS,"Old-fashioned sweetness of your quiet life,"
238,A SON SPEAKS,To know how women of these modern days
239,A SON SPEAKS,Make licence of their new-found liberty.
240,A SON SPEAKS,"Why, I have been more tempted and more shocked"
241,A SON SPEAKS,"By belles and beauties in the social whirl,"
242,A SON SPEAKS,"By trusted wives and mothers in their homes,"
243,A SON SPEAKS,Than by the women of the underworld
244,A SON SPEAKS,Who sell their favours.  Do you think me mad?
245,A SON SPEAKS,"No, mother; I am sane, but very sad."
246,A SON SPEAKS,
247,A SON SPEAKS,I miss my boyhood’s faith in woman’s worth—
248,A SON SPEAKS,"Torn from my heart, by ‘good folks’ of the earth."

253,THE YOUNGER BORN,THE YOUNGER BORN
254,THE YOUNGER BORN,
255,THE YOUNGER BORN,
256,THE YOUNGER BORN,The modern English-speaking young girl is the astonishment of the world
257,THE YOUNGER BORN,and the despair of the older generation.  Nothing like her has ever been
258,THE YOUNGER BORN,seen or heard before.  Alike in drawing-rooms and the amusement places of
259,THE YOUNGER BORN,"the people, she defies conventions in dress, speech, and conduct.  She is"
260,THE YOUNGER BORN,"bold, yet not immoral.  She is immodest, yet she is chaste.  She has no"
261,THE YOUNGER BORN,"ideals, yet she is kind and generous.  She is an anomaly and a paradox."
262,THE YOUNGER BORN,
263,THE YOUNGER BORN,"_WE are the little daughters of Time and the World his wife_,"
264,THE YOUNGER BORN,"_We are not like the children_, _born in their younger life_,"
265,THE YOUNGER BORN,_We are marred with our mother’s follies and torn with our father’s
266,THE YOUNGER BORN,strife_.
267,THE YOUNGER BORN,
268,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We are the little daughters of the modern world,"
269,THE YOUNGER BORN,"And Time, her spouse."
270,THE YOUNGER BORN,She has brought many children to our father’s house
271,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Before we came, when both our parents were content"
272,THE YOUNGER BORN,
273,THE YOUNGER BORN,With simple pleasures and with quiet homely ways.
274,THE YOUNGER BORN,Modest and mild
275,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Were the fair daughters born to them in those fair days,"
276,THE YOUNGER BORN,Modest and mild.
277,THE YOUNGER BORN,
278,THE YOUNGER BORN,"_But Father Time grew restless and longed for a swifter pace_,"
279,THE YOUNGER BORN,_And our mother pushed out beside him at the cost of her tender
280,THE YOUNGER BORN,"grace_,"
281,THE YOUNGER BORN,_And life was no more living but just a headlong race_.
282,THE YOUNGER BORN,
283,THE YOUNGER BORN,And we are wild—
284,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Yea, wild are we, the younger born of the World"
285,THE YOUNGER BORN,Into life’s vortex hurled.
286,THE YOUNGER BORN,With the milk of our mother’s breast
287,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We drank her own unrest,"
288,THE YOUNGER BORN,And we learned our speech from Time
289,THE YOUNGER BORN,Who scoffs at the things sublime.
290,THE YOUNGER BORN,Time and the World have hurried so
291,THE YOUNGER BORN,They could not help their younger born to grow;
292,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We only follow, follow where they go."
293,THE YOUNGER BORN,
294,THE YOUNGER BORN,_They left their high ideals behind them as they ran_;
295,THE YOUNGER BORN,"_There was but one goal_, _pleasure_, _for Woman or for Man_,"
296,THE YOUNGER BORN,_And they robbed the nights of slumber to lengthen the days’ brief
297,THE YOUNGER BORN,span_.
298,THE YOUNGER BORN,
299,THE YOUNGER BORN,We are the demi-virgins of the modern day;
300,THE YOUNGER BORN,"All evil on the earth is known to us in thought,"
301,THE YOUNGER BORN,But yet we do it not.
302,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We bare our beauteous bodies to the gaze of men,"
303,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We lure them, tempt them, lead them on, and then"
304,THE YOUNGER BORN,Lightly we turn away.
305,THE YOUNGER BORN,By strong compelling passion we are never stirred;
306,THE YOUNGER BORN,To us it is a word—
307,THE YOUNGER BORN,A word much used when tragic tales are told;
308,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We are the younger born, yet we are very old"
309,THE YOUNGER BORN,"In understanding, and our knowledge makes us bold."
310,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Boldly we look at life,"
311,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Loving its stress and strife,"
312,THE YOUNGER BORN,"And hating all conventions that may mean restraint,"
313,THE YOUNGER BORN,Yet shunning sin’s black taint.
314,THE YOUNGER BORN,
315,THE YOUNGER BORN,We know wine’s taste;
316,THE YOUNGER BORN,And the young-maiden bloom and sweetness of our lips
317,THE YOUNGER BORN,Is often in eclipse
318,THE YOUNGER BORN,Under the brown weed’s stain.
319,THE YOUNGER BORN,Yet we are chaste;
320,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We have no large capacity for joy or pain,"
321,THE YOUNGER BORN,But an insatiable appetite for pleasure.
322,THE YOUNGER BORN,We have no use for leisure
323,THE YOUNGER BORN,And never learned the meaning of that word ‘repose.’
324,THE YOUNGER BORN,Life as it goes
325,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Must spell excitement for us, be the cost what may."
326,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Speeding along the way,"
327,THE YOUNGER BORN,
328,THE YOUNGER BORN,"We ofttimes pause to do some generous little deed,"
329,THE YOUNGER BORN,And fill the cup of need;
330,THE YOUNGER BORN,"For we are kind at heart,"
331,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Though with less heart than head,"
332,THE YOUNGER BORN,"Unmoral, not immoral, when the worst is said;"
333,THE YOUNGER BORN,We are the product of the modern day.
334,THE YOUNGER BORN,
335,THE YOUNGER BORN,"_We are the little daughters of Time and the World his wife_,"
336,THE YOUNGER BORN,"_We are not like the children_, _born in their younger life_,"
337,THE YOUNGER BORN,_We are marred with our mother’s follies and torn with our father’s
338,THE YOUNGER BORN,strife_.

344,HAPPINESS,
345,HAPPINESS,
346,HAPPINESS,_THERE are so many little things that make life beautiful_.
347,HAPPINESS,I can recall a day in early youth when I was longing for happiness.
348,HAPPINESS,"Toward the western hills I gazed, watching for its approach."
349,HAPPINESS,"The hills lay between me and the setting sun, and over them led a"
350,HAPPINESS,highway.
351,HAPPINESS,"When some traveller crossed the hill, always a fine grey dust rose"
352,HAPPINESS,cloudless against the sky.
353,HAPPINESS,"The traveller I could not distinguish, but the dust-cloud I could see."
354,HAPPINESS,
355,HAPPINESS,And the dust-cloud seemed formed of hopes and possibilities—each speck
356,HAPPINESS,an embryo event.
357,HAPPINESS,"At sunset, when the skies were fair, the dust-cloud grew radiant and"
358,HAPPINESS,shone with visions.
359,HAPPINESS,The happiness for which I waited came not to me adown that western
360,HAPPINESS,"slope,"
361,HAPPINESS,"But now I can recall the cloud of golden dust, the sunset, and the"
362,HAPPINESS,"highway leading over the hill,"
363,HAPPINESS,"The wonderful hope and expectancy of my heart, the visions of youth in"
364,HAPPINESS,my eyes; and I know this was happiness.
365,HAPPINESS,
366,HAPPINESS,_There are so many little things that make life beautiful_.
367,HAPPINESS,I can recall another day when I rebelled at life’s monotony.
368,HAPPINESS,Everywhere about me was the commonplace; and nothing seemed to happen.
369,HAPPINESS,"Each day was like its yesterday, and to-morrow gave no promise of"
370,HAPPINESS,change.
371,HAPPINESS,My young heart rose rebellious in my breast; and I ran aimlessly into
372,HAPPINESS,the sunlight—the glowing sunlight of June.
373,HAPPINESS,"I sent out a dumb cry to Fate, demanding larger joys and more delight."
374,HAPPINESS,I ran blindly into a field of blooming clover.
375,HAPPINESS,"It was breast-high, and billowed about me like rose-red waves of a"
376,HAPPINESS,fragrant sea.
377,HAPPINESS,
378,HAPPINESS,The bees were singing above it; and their little brown bodies were
379,HAPPINESS,"loaded with honey-dew, extracted from the clover blossoms."
380,HAPPINESS,The sun reeled in the heavens dizzy with its own splendour.
381,HAPPINESS,"The day went into night, without bringing any new event to change my"
382,HAPPINESS,life.
383,HAPPINESS,"But now I recall the field of blooming clover, and the honey-laden"
384,HAPPINESS,"bees, the glorious June sunlight, and the passion of youth in my"
385,HAPPINESS,heart; and I know that was happiness.
386,HAPPINESS,
387,HAPPINESS,_There are so many little things that make life beautiful_.
388,HAPPINESS,"Yesterday a failure stared me in the face, where I had thought to"
389,HAPPINESS,welcome proud success.
390,HAPPINESS,"There was no radiant cloud of dust against the western sky, and no"
391,HAPPINESS,"clover field lying fragrant under mid-June suns,"
392,HAPPINESS,Neither was youth with me any more.
393,HAPPINESS,
394,HAPPINESS,"But under the vines that clung against my walls, a flock of birds"
395,HAPPINESS,sought shelter just at twilight;
396,HAPPINESS,"And, standing at my casement, I could hear the twitter of their voices"
397,HAPPINESS,"and the soft, sweet flutter of their wings."
398,HAPPINESS,"Then over me there fell a sense of peace and calm, and love for all"
399,HAPPINESS,"created things, and trust illimitable."
400,HAPPINESS,
401,HAPPINESS,And that I knew was happiness.

445,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"SAID Willie to Tom, ‘Let us hie away"
446,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,To the wonderful Island of Endless Play.
447,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
448,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"It lies off the border of “No School Land,”"
449,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"And abounds with pleasure, I understand."
450,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
451,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,There boys go swimming whenever they please
452,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,In a lovely river right under the trees.
453,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
454,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"And marbles are free, so you need not buy;"
455,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,And kites of all sizes are ready to fly.
456,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
457,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,We sail down the Isthmus of Idle Delight—
458,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,We sail and we sail for a day and a night.
459,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
460,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"And then, if favoured by billows and breeze,"
461,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,We land in the Harbour of Do-as-You-Please.
462,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
463,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"And there lies the Island of Endless Play,"
464,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"With no one to say to us, Must, or Nay."
465,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
466,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"Books are not known in that land so fair,"
467,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,Teachers are stoned if they set foot there.
468,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
469,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"Hurrah for the Island, so glad and free,"
470,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,That is the country for you and me.’
471,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
472,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,So away went Willie and Tom together
473,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"On a pleasure boat, in the lazy weather,"
474,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,And they sailed in the teeth of a friendly breeze
475,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,Right into the harbour of ‘Do-as-You-Please.’
476,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,Where boats and tackle and marbles and kites
477,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,Were waiting them there in this Land of Delights.
478,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,They dwelt on the Island of Endless Play
479,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,For five long years; then one sad day
480,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"A strange, dark ship sailed up to the strand,"
481,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"And ‘Ho! for the voyage to Stupid Land,’"
482,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"The captain cried, with a terrible noise,"
483,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,As he seized the frightened and struggling boys
484,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,And threw them into the dark ship’s hold;
485,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,And off and away sailed the captain bold.
486,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"They vainly begged him to let them out,"
487,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,He answered only with scoff and shout.
488,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"‘Boys that don’t study or work,’ said he,"
489,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,‘Must sail one day down the Ignorant Sea
490,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"To Stupid Land by the No-Book Strait,"
491,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,With Captain Time on the Pitiless Fate.’
492,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,
493,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,He let out the sails and away went the three
494,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"Over the waters of Ignorant Sea,"
495,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,Out and away to Stupid Land;
496,THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY,"And they live there yet, I understand."

508,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,We’ll visit them all as we leisurely creep
509,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"Down the winding stream whose current is deep,"
510,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,In our beautiful barge of Slumber.
511,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,
512,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,The very first isle in this wonderful stream
513,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"Quite close to the shore is lying,"
514,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And after a supper of cakes and cream
515,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"We come to the Night-Mare-Isle with a scream,"
516,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And hurry away from it crying.
517,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,
518,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"And next is the Island-of-Lullaby,"
519,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And every one there rejoices.
520,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"The winds are only a perfumed sigh,"
521,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And the birds that sing in the treetops try
522,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,To imitate Mothers’ voices.
523,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,
524,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,A little beyond is the Isle-of-Dreams;
525,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"Oh, that is the place to be straying."
526,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,Everything there is just as it seems;
527,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"Dolls are real and sunshine gleams,"
528,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And no one calls us from playing.
529,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,
530,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"And then we come to the drollest isle,"
531,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And the funniest sounds come pouring
532,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"Down from its borderlands once in a while,"
533,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And we lean o’er our barge and listen and smile;
534,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,For that is the Isle-of-Snoring.
535,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,
536,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,And the very last isle in the River of Sleep
537,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,Is the sunshiny Isle-of-Waking.
538,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"We see it first with our eyes a-peep,"
539,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,"And we give a yawn—then away we leap,"
540,THE RIVER OF SLEEP,The barge of Slumber forsaking.

685,THE CONVENTION,
686,THE CONVENTION,"Much they marvelled, these women of earth, at the strange and curious"

688,THE CONVENTION,"And some of them laughed, and some of them sneered, but they answered"

796,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,Those flowery praises led you to suppose
797,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"You were my benefactor.  Well, in truth,"
798,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,When lovely woman on dull man bestows
799,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"Sweet favours of her beauty and her youth,"
800,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,He is her debtor.  I am yours: and yet
801,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,_You robbed me while you placed me thus in debt_.
802,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,
803,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,I owe you for keen moments when you stirred
804,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"My senses with your beauty, when your eyes"
805,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,(Your wanton eyes) belied the prudent word
806,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"Your curled lips uttered.  You are worldly wise,"
807,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"And while you like to set men’s hearts on flame,"
808,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,You take no risks in that old passion-game.
809,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,
810,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"The carnal, common self of dual me"
811,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,Found pleasure in this danger play of yours.
812,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"(An egotist, man always thinks to be"
813,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"The victor, if his patience but endures,"
814,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"And holds in leash the hounds of fierce desire,"
815,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,Until the silly woman’s heart takes fire.)
816,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,

818,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,The Me of me—the inner Man—the real—
819,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,Whoever dreams his dream and ever seeks
820,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,To bring to earth his beautiful ideal.
821,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,That lifelong dream with all its promised joy
822,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,Your soft bedevilments have helped destroy.
823,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,
824,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"Woman, how can I hope for happy life"
825,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"In days to come at my own nuptial hearth,"
826,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,When you who bear the honoured name of wife
827,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,So lightly hold the dearest gifts of earth?
828,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"Descending from your pedestal, alas!"
829,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,You shake the pedestals of all your class.
830,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,
831,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"A vain, flirtatious wife is like a thief"
832,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"Who breaks into the temple of men’s souls,"
833,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"And steals the golden vessels of belief,"
834,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"The swinging censers, and the incense bowls."
835,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,"All women seem less loyal and less true,"
836,A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT,Less worthy of men’s faith since I met you.

852,THE SUPERWOMAN,
853,THE SUPERWOMAN,"She will bring beauty, not the transient dower"
854,THE SUPERWOMAN,Of adolescence which departs with youth—

856,THE SUPERWOMAN,Of its eternal message and the source
857,THE SUPERWOMAN,Of all its potent force.
858,THE SUPERWOMAN,Her outer being by the inner thought
859,THE SUPERWOMAN,Shall into lasting loveliness be wrought.
860,THE SUPERWOMAN,
861,THE SUPERWOMAN,She will bring virtue; but it will not be
862,THE SUPERWOMAN,"The pale, white blossom of cold chastity"
863,THE SUPERWOMAN,Which hides a barren heart.  She will be human—

876,THE SUPERWOMAN,"Will she invite from space an embryo soul,"
877,THE SUPERWOMAN,"To live on earth again in mortal fashion,"
878,THE SUPERWOMAN,Unless love stirs her with divinest passion.
879,THE SUPERWOMAN,
880,THE SUPERWOMAN,To motherhood she will bring common sense—
881,THE SUPERWOMAN,That most uncommon virtue.  She will give
882,THE SUPERWOMAN,Love that is more than she-wolf violence
883,THE SUPERWOMAN,(Which slaughters others that its own may live).
884,THE SUPERWOMAN,
885,THE SUPERWOMAN,Love that will help each little tendril mind
886,THE SUPERWOMAN,To grow and climb;

889,THE SUPERWOMAN,
890,THE SUPERWOMAN,"She will be formed to guide, but not to lead—"

894,THE SUPERWOMAN,"Which casts its searchlight on the course of fate,"
895,THE SUPERWOMAN,"And to the leaders says, ‘Proceed’ or ‘Wait.’"
896,THE SUPERWOMAN,
897,THE SUPERWOMAN,"And best of all, she will bring holy faith"
898,THE SUPERWOMAN,"To penetrate the shadowy world of death,"
899,THE SUPERWOMAN,"And show the road beyond it, bright and broad,"
900,THE SUPERWOMAN,That leads straight up to God.

974,THREE SOULS,And gained permission of the Guard to wait.
975,THREE SOULS,"Barred from the bliss of Paradise by sin,"
976,THREE SOULS,They did not ask or hope to enter in.
977,THREE SOULS,‘We loved one woman (thus their story ran);
978,THREE SOULS,"We lost her, for she chose another man."
979,THREE SOULS,"So great our love, it brought us to this door;"

987,THREE SOULS,"Brought us together, comrades, to this goal,"

989,THREE SOULS,For one great moment—that is all we ask.
990,THREE SOULS,"And, having seen her, we must journey back"
991,THREE SOULS,The path we came—a hard and dangerous track.’
992,THREE SOULS,"‘Wait, then,’ the Angel said, ‘beside me here,"
993,THREE SOULS,But do not strive within God’s Gate to peer
994,THREE SOULS,Nor converse hold with Spirits clothed in light
995,THREE SOULS,Who pass this way; thou hast not earned the right.’
996,THREE SOULS,
997,THREE SOULS,"They waited year on year.  Then, like a flame,"
998,THREE SOULS,News of the woman’s death from earth-land came.

1003,THREE SOULS,"A message to them.  ‘She has gone,’ he said,"
1004,THREE SOULS,‘Down to the lower regions of the dead;
1005,THREE SOULS,Her chosen mate went first; so great her love
1006,THREE SOULS,She has resigned the joys that wait above
1007,THREE SOULS,"To dwell with him, until perchance some day,"
1008,THREE SOULS,"Absolved from sin, he seeks the Better Way.’"
1009,THREE SOULS,
1010,THREE SOULS,"Silent, the lovers turned.  The pitying Guard"
1011,THREE SOULS,"Said: ‘Stay (the while his hand the door unbarred),"
1012,THREE SOULS,There waits for thee no darker grief or woe;
1013,THREE SOULS,"Enter the Gates, and all God’s glories know."
1014,THREE SOULS,"But to be ready for so great a bliss,"
1015,THREE SOULS,Pause for a moment and take heed of this:
1016,THREE SOULS,The dearest treasure by each mortal lost
1017,THREE SOULS,"Lies yonder, when the Threshold has been crossed,"
1018,THREE SOULS,And thou shalt find within that Sacred Place
1019,THREE SOULS,The shining wonder of her worshipped face.
1020,THREE SOULS,All that is past is but a troubled dream;
1021,THREE SOULS,Go forward now and claim the Fact Supreme.’

1626,DIVORCED,Most holy office; knew God meant it so.
1627,DIVORCED,"Yet even then, I held your wishes first;"
1628,DIVORCED,And by my double duties lost the bloom
1629,DIVORCED,And freshness of my beauty; and beheld
1630,DIVORCED,A look of disapproval in your eyes.
1631,DIVORCED,"But with the coming of our precious child,"
1632,DIVORCED,"The lover’s smile, tinged with the father’s pride,"
1633,DIVORCED,Returned again; and helped to make me strong;
1634,DIVORCED,And life was very sweet for both of us.
1635,DIVORCED,
1636,DIVORCED,"Another, and another birth, and twice"
1637,DIVORCED,The little white hearse paused beside our door
1638,DIVORCED,And took away some portion of my youth
1639,DIVORCED,With my sweet babies.  At the first you seemed
1640,DIVORCED,"To suffer with me, standing very near;"
1641,DIVORCED,"But when I wept too long, you turned away."
1642,DIVORCED,"And I was hurt, not realising then"
1643,DIVORCED,My grief was selfish.  I could see the change
1644,DIVORCED,Which motherhood and sorrow made in me;
1645,DIVORCED,"And when I saw the change that came to you,"
1646,DIVORCED,"Saw how your eyes looked past me when you talked,"
1647,DIVORCED,"And when I missed the love tone from your voice,"
1648,DIVORCED,"I did that foolish thing weak women do,"
1649,DIVORCED,"Complained and cried, accused you of neglect,"
1650,DIVORCED,And made myself obnoxious in your sight.
1651,DIVORCED,
1652,DIVORCED,"And often, after you had left my side,"
1653,DIVORCED,"Alone I stood before my mirror, mad"
1654,DIVORCED,"With anger at my pallid cheeks, my dull"
1655,DIVORCED,"Unlighted eyes, my shrunken mother-breasts,"
1656,DIVORCED,"And wept, and wept, and faded more and more."
1657,DIVORCED,"How could I hope to win back wandering love,"
1658,DIVORCED,"And make new flames in dying embers leap,"
1659,DIVORCED,By such ungracious means?
1660,DIVORCED,
1661,DIVORCED,"And then She came,"
1662,DIVORCED,"Firm-bosomed, round of cheek, with such young eyes,"
1663,DIVORCED,And all the ways of youth.  I who had died
1664,DIVORCED,"A thousand deaths, in waiting the return"
1665,DIVORCED,"Of that old love-look to your face once more,"
1666,DIVORCED,Died yet again and went straight into hell
1667,DIVORCED,When I beheld it come at her approach.
1668,DIVORCED,
1669,DIVORCED,"My God, my God, how have I borne it all!"
1670,DIVORCED,Yet since she had the power to wake that look—
1671,DIVORCED,The power to sweep the ashes from your heart
1672,DIVORCED,"Of burned-out love of me, and light new fires,"
1673,DIVORCED,One thing remained for me—to let you go.
1674,DIVORCED,I had no wish to keep the empty frame
1675,DIVORCED,From which the priceless picture had been wrenched.
1676,DIVORCED,Nor do I blame you; it was not your fault:
1677,DIVORCED,You gave me all that most men can give—love
1678,DIVORCED,"Of youth, of beauty, and of passion; and"
1679,DIVORCED,I gave you full return; my womanhood
1680,DIVORCED,"Matched well your manhood.  Yet had you grown ill,"
1681,DIVORCED,"Or old, and unattractive from some cause"
1682,DIVORCED,"(Less close than was my service unto you),"
1683,DIVORCED,"I should have clung the tighter to you, dear;"
1684,DIVORCED,"And loved you, loved you, loved you more and more."
1685,DIVORCED,
1686,DIVORCED,I grow so weary thinking of these things;
1687,DIVORCED,"Day in, day out; and half the awful nights."

1692,THE REVEALING ANGELS,THE REVEALING ANGELS
1693,THE REVEALING ANGELS,
1694,THE REVEALING ANGELS,
1695,THE REVEALING ANGELS,SUDDENLY and without warning they came—
1696,THE REVEALING ANGELS,The Revealing Angels came.
1697,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Suddenly and simultaneously, through city streets,"
1698,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Through quiet lanes and country roads they walked.
1699,THE REVEALING ANGELS,They walked crying: ‘God has sent us to find
1700,THE REVEALING ANGELS,The vilest sinners of earth.
1701,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"We are to bring them before Him, before the Lord of Life.’"
1702,THE REVEALING ANGELS,
1703,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Their voices were like bugles;
1704,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"And then all war, all strife,"
1705,THE REVEALING ANGELS,And all the noises of the world grew still;
1706,THE REVEALING ANGELS,And no one talked;
1707,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"And no one toiled, but many strove to flee away."
1708,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Robbers and thieves, and those sunk in drunkenness and crime,"
1709,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Men and women of evil repute,"
1710,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"And mothers with fatherless children in their arms, all strove to"
1711,THE REVEALING ANGELS,hide.
1712,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"But the Revealing Angels passed them by,"
1713,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Saying: ‘Not you, not you."
1714,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Another day, when we shall come again"
1715,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Unto the haunts of men,"
1716,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Then we will call your names;
1717,THE REVEALING ANGELS,But God has asked us first to bring to him
1718,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Those guilty of greater shames
1719,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Than lust, or theft, or drunkenness, or vice—"
1720,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Yea, greater than murder done in passion,"
1721,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Or self-destruction done in dark despair.
1722,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Now in His Holy Name we call:
1723,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Come one and all
1724,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Come forth; reveal your faces.’
1725,THE REVEALING ANGELS,
1726,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Then through the awful silence of the world,"
1727,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Where noise had ceased, they came—"
1728,THE REVEALING ANGELS,The sinful hosts.
1729,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"They came from lowly and from lofty places,"
1730,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Some poorly clad, but many clothed like queens;"
1731,THE REVEALING ANGELS,They came from scenes of revel and from toil;
1732,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"From haunts of sin, from palaces, from homes,"
1733,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"From boudoirs, and from churches."
1734,THE REVEALING ANGELS,They came like ghosts—
1735,THE REVEALING ANGELS,_The vast brigades of women who had slain_
1736,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"_Their helpless_, _unborn children_.  With them trailed"
1737,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Lovers and husbands who had said, ‘Do this,’"
1738,THE REVEALING ANGELS,And those who helped for hire.
1739,THE REVEALING ANGELS,They stood before the Angels—before the Revealing
1740,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Angels they stood.
1741,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"And they heard the Angels say,"
1742,THE REVEALING ANGELS,And all the listening world heard the Angels say:
1743,THE REVEALING ANGELS,‘These are the vilest sinners of all;
1744,THE REVEALING ANGELS,For the Lord of Life made sex that birth might come;
1745,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Made sex and its keen compelling desire
1746,THE REVEALING ANGELS,To fashion bodies wherein souls might go
1747,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"From lower planes to higher,"
1748,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Until the end is reached (which is Beginning).
1749,THE REVEALING ANGELS,They have stolen the costly pleasures of the senses
1750,THE REVEALING ANGELS,And refused to pay God’s price.
1751,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"They have come together, these men and these women,"
1752,THE REVEALING ANGELS,As male and female they have come together
1753,THE REVEALING ANGELS,In the great creative act.
1754,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"They have invited souls, and then flung them out into space;"
1755,THE REVEALING ANGELS,They have made a jest of God’s design.
1756,THE REVEALING ANGELS,All other sins look white beside this sinning;
1757,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"All other sins may be condoned, forgiven;"
1758,THE REVEALING ANGELS,All other sinners may be cleansed and shriven;
1759,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Not these, not these."
1760,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"Pass on, and meet God’s eyes.’"
1761,THE REVEALING ANGELS,
1762,THE REVEALING ANGELS,"The vast brigade moved forward, and behind then walked the Angels,"
1763,THE REVEALING ANGELS,Walked the sorrowful Revealing Angels.

1773,THE WELL-BORN,In answer to the fertile mother need!
1774,THE WELL-BORN,So few who seem
1775,THE WELL-BORN,The image of the Maker’s mortal dream;
1776,THE WELL-BORN,So many born of mere propinquity—
1777,THE WELL-BORN,"Of lustful habit, or of accident."
1778,THE WELL-BORN,Their mothers felt
1779,THE WELL-BORN,"No mighty, all-compelling wish to see"
1780,THE WELL-BORN,Their bosoms garden-places
1781,THE WELL-BORN,Abloom with flower faces;
1782,THE WELL-BORN,No tidal wave swept o’er them with its flood;
1783,THE WELL-BORN,No thrill of flesh or heart; no leap of blood;
1784,THE WELL-BORN,"No glowing fire, flaming to white desire"
1785,THE WELL-BORN,For mating and for motherhood:
1786,THE WELL-BORN,Yet they bore children.
1787,THE WELL-BORN,"God! how mankind misuses Thy command,"
1788,THE WELL-BORN,To populate the earth!
1789,THE WELL-BORN,How low is brought high birth!
1790,THE WELL-BORN,"How low the woman; when, inert as spawn"
1791,THE WELL-BORN,"Left on the sands to fertilise,"
1792,THE WELL-BORN,She is the means through which the race goes on!
1793,THE WELL-BORN,Not so the first intent.
1794,THE WELL-BORN,"Birth, as the Supreme Mind conceived it, meant"
1795,THE WELL-BORN,The clear imperious call of mate to mate
1796,THE WELL-BORN,And the clear answer.  Only thus and then
1797,THE WELL-BORN,"Are fine, well-ordered, and potential lives"
1798,THE WELL-BORN,Brought into being.  Not by Church or State
1799,THE WELL-BORN,"Can birth be made legitimate,"
1800,THE WELL-BORN,Unless
1801,THE WELL-BORN,Love in its fulness bless.
1802,THE WELL-BORN,Creation so ordains its lofty laws
1803,THE WELL-BORN,"That man, while greater in all other things,"
1804,THE WELL-BORN,Is lesser in the generative cause.
1805,THE WELL-BORN,"The father may be merely man, the male;"
1806,THE WELL-BORN,Yet more than female must the mother be.
1807,THE WELL-BORN,The woman who would fashion
1808,THE WELL-BORN,"Souls, for the use of earth and angels meet,"
1809,THE WELL-BORN,Must entertain a high and holy passion.
1810,THE WELL-BORN,"Not rank, or wealth, or influence of kings"
1811,THE WELL-BORN,Can give a soul its dower
1812,THE WELL-BORN,"Of majesty and power,"
1813,THE WELL-BORN,Unless the mother brings
1814,THE WELL-BORN,Great love to that great hour.

1956,THE SILENT TRAGEDY,Rebellion finds its only utterance
1957,THE SILENT TRAGEDY,"In shattered nerves, and lack of self-control;"

1967,THE SILENT TRAGEDY,Since everywhere in Nature sex is shown

2050,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2051,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"I HAD been almost happy for an hour,"
2052,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Lost to the world that knew me in the park
2053,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Among strange faces; while my little girl
2054,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Leaped with the squirrels, chirruped with the birds"
2055,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"And with the sunlight glowed.  She was so dear,"
2056,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"So beautiful, so sweet; and for the time"
2057,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"The rose of love, shorn of its thorn of shame,"
2058,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Bloomed in my heart.  Then suddenly you passed.
2059,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,I sat alone upon the public bench;
2060,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"You, with your lawful husband, rode in state;"
2061,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"And when your eyes fell on me and my child,"
2062,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"They were not eyes, but daggers, poison tipped."
2063,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2064,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,God! how good women slaughter with a look!
2065,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"And, like cold steel, your glance cut through my heart,"
2066,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Struck every petal from the rose of love
2067,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,And left the ragged stalk alive with thorns.
2068,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2069,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,My little one came running to my side
2070,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,And called me Mother.  It was like a blow
2071,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Between the eyes; and made me sick with pain.
2072,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,And then it seemed as if each bird and breeze
2073,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Took up the word, and changed its syllables"
2074,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,From Mother into Magdalene; and cried
2075,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,My shame to all the world.
2076,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2077,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,It was your eyes
2078,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Which did all this.  But listen now to me

2083,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,(Save one who took your gold and sold his skill
2084,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,And jeopardized his name for your base ends).
2085,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2086,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,I know how you have sunk your soul in sense
2087,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Like any wanton; and refused to bear
2088,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,The harvest of your pleasure-planted seed;
2089,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,I know how you have crushed the tender bud
2090,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Which held a soul; how you have blighted it;
2091,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,And made the holy miracle of birth
2092,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,A wicked travesty of God’s design;
2093,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Yea, many buds, which might be blossoms now"
2094,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"And beautify your selfish, arid life,"
2095,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Have been destroyed, because you chose to keep"
2096,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"The aimless freedom, and the purposeless,"
2097,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Self-seeking liberty of childless wives.
2098,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2099,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"I was an untaught girl.  By nature led,"
2100,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"By love and passion blinded, I became"
2101,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"An unwed mother.  You, an honoured wife,"
2102,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Refuse the crown of motherhood, defy"
2103,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"The laws of nature, and fling baby souls"
2104,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Back in the face of God.  And yet you dare
2105,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Call me a sinner, and yourself a saint;"
2106,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"And all the world smiles on you, and its doors"
2107,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,Swing wide at your approach.
2108,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,I stand outside.
2109,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,
2110,THE UNWED MOTHER TO THE WIFE,"Surely there must be higher courts than earth,"

2129,FATHER AND SON,About my father’s youth.
2130,FATHER AND SON,
2131,FATHER AND SON,She says: ‘Your father laughed his way through earth:
2132,FATHER AND SON,"He laughed right in the doctor’s face at birth,"
2133,FATHER AND SON,"Such joy of life he had, such founts of mirth."
2134,FATHER AND SON,"Ah, what a lad was he!’"
2135,FATHER AND SON,"And then she sighs.  I feel her silent blame,"
2136,FATHER AND SON,Because I brought her nothing but his name.
2137,FATHER AND SON,Because she does not see
2138,FATHER AND SON,Her worshipped son in me.
2139,FATHER AND SON,"I could, but would not, speak in my defence,"
2140,FATHER AND SON,Anent the difference.
2141,FATHER AND SON,
2142,FATHER AND SON,She says: ‘He won all prizes in his time:

2144,FATHER AND SON,At high ambition’s door I lay the crime.
2145,FATHER AND SON,"Ah, what a lad he was!’"
2146,FATHER AND SON,"Well, let her rest in that deceiving thought,"
2147,FATHER AND SON,"Of what avail to say, ‘His death was brought"
2148,FATHER AND SON,"By broken sexual laws,"
2149,FATHER AND SON,The ancient sinful cause.’
2150,FATHER AND SON,"I could, but would not, tell the good old dame"

2152,FATHER AND SON,
2153,FATHER AND SON,"I could say: ‘I am crippled, weak, and pale,"
2154,FATHER AND SON,Because my father was an unleashed male.
2155,FATHER AND SON,"Because he ran so fast, I halt and fail"
2156,FATHER AND SON,"(Ah, yes, he was the lad),"
2157,FATHER AND SON,Because he drained each cup of sense-delight
2158,FATHER AND SON,"I must go thirsting, thirsting, day and night."
2159,FATHER AND SON,"Because he was joy-mad,"
2160,FATHER AND SON,I must be always sad.
2161,FATHER AND SON,
2162,FATHER AND SON,"Because he learned no law of self-control,"
2163,FATHER AND SON,I am a blighted soul.’
2164,FATHER AND SON,Of what avail to speak and spoil her joy.
2165,FATHER AND SON,"Better to see her disapproving eyes,"
2166,FATHER AND SON,"And silent, hear her say, between her sighs,"
