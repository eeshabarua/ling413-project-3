147,I.,I.
148,I.,
149,I.,I'll tell you a Fairy Tale that's new:
150,I.,How the merry Elves o'er the ocean flew
151,I.,"From the Emerald isle to this far-off shore,"
152,I.,As they were wont in the days of yore;
153,I.,"And played their pranks one moonlit night,"
154,I.,Where the zephyrs alone could see the sight.
155,I.,
156,I.,
157,II.,II.
158,II.,
159,II.,"Ere the Old world yet had found the New,"
160,II.,The fairies oft in their frolics flew
161,II.,To the fragrant isles of the Caribbee--
162,II.,Bright bosom-gems of a golden sea.
163,II.,"Too dark was the film of the Indian's eye,"
164,II.,"These gossamer sprites to suspect or spy,--"
165,II.,"So they danced 'mid the spicy groves unseen,"
166,II.,"And mad were their merry pranks, I ween;"
167,II.,"For the fairies, like other discreet little elves,"
168,II.,Are freest and fondest when all by themselves.
169,II.,"No thought had they that in after time,"
170,II.,The Muse would echo their deeds in rhyme;
171,II.,"So gayly doffing light stocking and shoe,"
172,II.,They tripped o'er the meadow all dappled in dew.
173,II.,
174,II.,
175,III.,III.
176,III.,
177,III.,"I could tell, if I would, some right merry tales,"
178,III.,Of unslippered fairies that danced in the vales--
179,III.,But the lovers of scandal I leave in the lurch--
180,III.,"And, beside, these elves don't belong to the church."
181,III.,If they danced--be it known--'twas not in the clime
182,III.,"Of your Mathers and Hookers, where laughter was crime;"
183,III.,"Where sentinel virtue kept guard o'er the lip,"
184,III.,Though witchcraft stole into the heart by a slip!
185,III.,Oh no! 'twas the land of the fruit and the flower--
186,III.,Where Summer and Spring both dwelt in one bower--
187,III.,"Where one hung the citron, all ripe from the bough,"
188,III.,And the other with blossoms encircled her brow;
189,III.,"Where the mountains embosomed rich tissues of gold,"
190,III.,And the rivers o'er rubies and emeralds rolled.
191,III.,"It was there, where the seasons came only to bless,"
192,III.,"And the fashions of Eden still lingered, in dress,"
193,III.,"That these gay little fairies were wont, as I say,"
194,III.,To steal in their merriest gambols away.
195,III.,"But dropping the curtain o'er frolic and fun,"
196,III.,"Too good to be told, or too bad to be done,"
197,III.,"I give you a legend from Fancy's own sketch,"
198,III.,Though I warn you he's given to fibbing--the wretch!
199,III.,"Yet I learn by the legends of breezes and brooks,"
200,III.,'Tis as true as the fairy tales told in the books.
201,III.,
202,III.,
203,IV.,IV.
204,IV.,
205,IV.,"One night, when the moon shone fair on the main,"
206,IV.,Choice spirits were gathered from meadow and plain--
207,IV.,"And lightly embarking from Erin's bold cliffs,"
208,IV.,They slid o'er the wave in their moonbeam skiffs.
209,IV.,A ray for a rudder--a thought for a sail--
210,IV.,"Swift, swift was each bark as the wing of the gale."
211,IV.,
212,IV.,[Illustration: Voyage of the Fairies]
213,IV.,
214,IV.,"Yet long were the tale,"
215,IV.,Should I linger to say
216,IV.,What gambol and frolic
217,IV.,Enlivened the way;
218,IV.,How they flirted with bubbles
219,IV.,"That danced on the wave,"
220,IV.,Or listened to mermaids
221,IV.,That sang from the cave;
222,IV.,Or slid with the moonbeams
223,IV.,Down deep to the grove
224,IV.,"Of coral, where mullet"
225,IV.,And goldfish rove:
226,IV.,"How there, in long vistas"
227,IV.,"Of silence and sleep,"
228,IV.,"They waltzed, as if mocking"
229,IV.,The death of the deep:
230,IV.,"How, oft, where the wreck"
231,IV.,"Lay scattered and torn,"
232,IV.,"They peeped in the skull,"
233,IV.,All ghastly and lorn;
234,IV.,"Or deep, 'mid wild rocks,"
235,IV.,"Quizzed the goggling shark,"
236,IV.,"And mouthed at the sea-wolf,"
237,IV.,So solemn and stark;
238,IV.,Each seeming to think
239,IV.,That the earth and the sea
240,IV.,"Were made but for fairies,"
241,IV.,For gambol and glee!
242,IV.,
243,IV.,
244,V.,V.
245,V.,
246,V.,"Enough, that at last they came to the Isle,"
247,V.,Where moonlight and fragrance were rivals the while.
248,V.,"Not yet had those vessels from Palos been here,"
249,V.,To turn the bright gem to the blood-mingled tear.
250,V.,"Oh no! still blissful and peaceful the land,"
251,V.,And the merry elves flew from the sea to the strand.
252,V.,"Right happy and joyous seemed now the fond crew,"
253,V.,"As they tripped 'mid the orange groves flashing in dew,"
254,V.,"For they were to hold a revel that night,"
255,V.,"A gay fancy ball, and each to be dight"
256,V.,"In the gem or the flower that fancy might choose,"
257,V.,"From mountain or vale, for its fragrance or hues."
258,V.,
259,V.,
260,VI.,VI.
261,VI.,
262,VI.,Away sped the maskers like arrows of light
263,VI.,To gather their gear for the revel bright.
264,VI.,"To the dazzling peaks of far-off Peru,"
265,VI.,"In emulous speed some sportively flew,"
266,VI.,"And deep in the mine, or 'mid glaciers on high,"
267,VI.,For ruby and sapphire searched heedful and sly.
268,VI.,For diamonds rare that gleam in the bed
269,VI.,"Of Brazilian streams, some merrily sped,"
270,VI.,"While others for topaz and emerald stray,"
271,VI.,'Mid the cradle cliffs of the Paraguay.
272,VI.,
273,VI.,[Illustration: The Fairies' Search]
274,VI.,
275,VI.,
276,VII.,VII.
277,VII.,
278,VII.,"As these are gathering the rarest of gems,"
279,VII.,Others are plucking the rarest of stems.
280,VII.,"They range wild dells where the zephyr alone,"
281,VII.,To the blushing blossoms before was known;
282,VII.,"Through forests they fly, whose branches are hung"
283,VII.,"By creeping plants, with fair flowerets strung,"
284,VII.,"Where temples of nature with arches of bloom,"
285,VII.,"Are lit by the moonlight, and faint with perfume."
286,VII.,"They stray where the mangrove and clematis twine,"
287,VII.,Where azalia and laurel in rivalry shine;
288,VII.,"Where, tall as the oak, the passion-tree glows,"
289,VII.,And jasmine is blent with rhodora and rose.
290,VII.,"O'er blooming savannas and meadows of light,"
291,VII.,"'Mid regions of summer they sweep in their flight,"
292,VII.,"And gathering the fairest, they speed to their bower,"
293,VII.,Each one with his favorite brilliant or flower.
294,VII.,
295,VII.,
296,VIII.,VIII.
297,VIII.,
298,VIII.,"The hour is come, and the fairies are seen"
299,VIII.,In their plunder arrayed on the moonlit green.
300,VIII.,"The music is breathed--'tis a soft strain of pleasure,"
301,VIII.,And the light giddy throng whirl into the measure.
302,VIII.,
303,VIII.,[Illustration: The Fairy Dance]
304,VIII.,
305,VIII.,"'Twas a joyous dance, and the dresses were bright,"
306,VIII.,Such as never were known till that famous night;
307,VIII.,"For the gems and the flowers that shone in the scene,"
308,VIII.,O'ermatched the regalia of princess and queen.
309,VIII.,No gaudy slave to a fair one's brow
310,VIII.,"Was the rose, or the ruby, or emerald now,"
311,VIII.,"But lighted with souls by the playful elves,"
312,VIII.,The brilliants and blossoms seemed dancing themselves.
313,VIII.,
314,VIII.,
315,IX.,IX.
316,IX.,
317,IX.,"Of all that did chance, 'twere a long tale to tell,"
318,IX.,"Of the dresses and waltzes, and who was the belle;"
319,IX.,"But each was so happy, and all were so fair,"
320,IX.,That night stole away and the dawn caught them there!
321,IX.,"Such a scampering never before was seen,"
322,IX.,As the fairies' flight on that island green.
323,IX.,"They rushed to the bay with twinkling feet,"
324,IX.,"But vain was their haste, for the moonlight fleet"
325,IX.,"Had passed with the dawn, and never again"
326,IX.,Were those fairies permitted to traverse the main.
327,IX.,"But 'mid the groves, when the sun was high,"
328,IX.,"The Indian marked with a worshipping eye,"
329,IX.,"The HUMMING BIRDS, all unknown before,"
330,IX.,"Glancing like thoughts from flower to flower,"
331,IX.,"And seeming as if earth's loveliest things,"
332,IX.,"The brilliants and blossoms, had taken wings:"
333,IX.,"And Fancy hath whispered in numbers light,"
334,IX.,"That these are the fairies who danced that night,"
335,IX.,"And linger yet in the garb they wore,"
336,IX.,Content in our clime and more blest than before!

347,IX.,
348,IX.,"Father of Lakes! thy waters bend,"
349,IX.,"Beyond the eagle's utmost view,"
350,IX.,"When, throned in heaven, he sees thee send"
351,IX.,Back to the sky its world of blue.
352,IX.,
353,IX.,Boundless and deep the forests weave
354,IX.,"Their twilight shade thy borders o'er,"
355,IX.,"And threatening cliffs, like giants, heave"
356,IX.,Their rugged forms along thy shore.
357,IX.,
358,IX.,"Nor can the light canoes, that glide"
359,IX.,"Across thy breast like things of air,"
360,IX.,"Chase from thy lone and level tide,"
361,IX.,The spell of stillness deepening there.
362,IX.,
363,IX.,"Yet round this waste of wood and wave,"
364,IX.,"Unheard, unseen, a spirit lives,"
365,IX.,"That, breathing o'er each rock and cave,"
366,IX.,"To all, a wild, strange aspect gives."
367,IX.,
368,IX.,"The thunder-riven oak, that flings"
369,IX.,"Its grisly arms athwart the sky,"
370,IX.,"A sudden, startling image brings"
371,IX.,To the lone traveller's kindled eye.
372,IX.,
373,IX.,The gnarled and braided boughs that show
374,IX.,"Their dim forms in the forest shade,"
375,IX.,"Like wrestling serpents seem, and throw"
376,IX.,Fantastic horrors through the glade.
377,IX.,
378,IX.,"The very echoes round this shore,"
379,IX.,"Have caught a strange and gibbering tone,"
380,IX.,"For they have told the war-whoop o'er,"
381,IX.,Till the wild chorus is their own.
382,IX.,
383,IX.,"Wave of the wilderness, adieu--"
384,IX.,"Adieu, ye rocks, ye wilds, ye woods!"
385,IX.,"Roll on, thou Element of blue,"
386,IX.,And fill these awful solitudes!
387,IX.,
388,IX.,Thou hast no tale to tell of man.
389,IX.,"God is thy theme. Ye sounding caves,"
390,IX.,"Whisper of Him, whose mighty plan,"
391,IX.,Deems as a bubble all your waves!

396,IX.,The Leaf.
397,IX.,
398,IX.,
399,IX.,[Illustration: The Leaf]
400,IX.,
401,IX.,"It came with spring's soft sun and showers,"
402,IX.,Mid bursting buds and blushing flowers;
403,IX.,"It flourished on the same light stem,"
404,IX.,It drank the same clear dews with them.
405,IX.,The crimson tints of summer morn
406,IX.,"That gilded one, did each adorn:"
407,IX.,The breeze that whispered light and brief
408,IX.,"To bud or blossom, kissed the leaf;"
409,IX.,"When o'er the leaf the tempest flew,"
410,IX.,The bud and blossom trembled too.
411,IX.,
412,IX.,"But its companions passed away,"
413,IX.,And left the leaf to lone decay.
414,IX.,The gentle gales of spring went by:
415,IX.,The fruits and flowers of summer die.
416,IX.,"The autumn winds swept o'er the hill,"
417,IX.,And winter's breath came cold and chill.
418,IX.,"The leaf now yielded to the blast,"
419,IX.,And on the rushing stream was cast.
420,IX.,"Far, far it glided to the sea,"
421,IX.,"And whirled and eddied wearily,"
422,IX.,"Till suddenly it sank to rest,"
423,IX.,And slumbered in the ocean's breast.
424,IX.,
425,IX.,"Thus life begins--its morning hours,"
426,IX.,Bright as the birthday of the flowers--
427,IX.,"Thus passes like the leaves away,"
428,IX.,As withered and as lost as they.
429,IX.,Beneath the parent roof we meet
430,IX.,"In joyous groups, and gayly greet"
431,IX.,"The golden beams of love and light,"
432,IX.,That dawn upon the youthful sight.
433,IX.,"But soon we part, and one by one,"
434,IX.,"Like leaves and flowers, the group is gone."
435,IX.,"One gentle spirit seeks the tomb,"
436,IX.,His brow yet fresh with childhood's bloom:
437,IX.,"Another treads the paths of fame,"
438,IX.,And barters peace to win a name.
439,IX.,"Another still, tempts fortune's wave,"
440,IX.,"And seeking wealth, secures a grave."
441,IX.,"The last, grasps yet the brittle thread:"
442,IX.,Though friends are gone and joy is dead--
443,IX.,"Still dares the dark and fretful tide,"
444,IX.,And clutches at its power and pride--
445,IX.,"Till suddenly the waters sever,"
446,IX.,"And like the leaf, he sinks for ever!"

455,IX.,
456,IX.,"Twas morn, and, wending on its way,"
457,IX.,Beside my path a stream was playing;
458,IX.,"And down its banks, in humor gay,"
459,IX.,A thoughtless boy was idly straying.
460,IX.,
461,IX.,Light as the breeze they onward flew--
462,IX.,"That joyous youth and laughing tide,"
463,IX.,"And seemed each other's course to woo,"
464,IX.,For long they bounded side by side.
465,IX.,
466,IX.,"And now the dimpling water staid,"
467,IX.,And glassed its ripples in a nook;
468,IX.,"And on its breast a bubble played,"
469,IX.,Which won the boy's admiring look.
470,IX.,
471,IX.,"He bent him o'er the river's brim,"
472,IX.,And on the radiant vision gazed;
473,IX.,"For lovelier still it seemed to him,"
474,IX.,That in its breast his imaged blazed.
475,IX.,
476,IX.,"With beating heart and trembling finger,"
477,IX.,"He stooped the wondrous gem to clasp,"
478,IX.,"But, spellbound, seemed a while to linger,"
479,IX.,Ere yet he made th' adventurous grasp.
480,IX.,
481,IX.,"And still a while the glittering toy,"
482,IX.,"Coquettish, seemed to shun the snare,"
483,IX.,"And then more eager grew the boy,"
484,IX.,And followed with impetuous air.
485,IX.,
486,IX.,"Round and around, with heedful eyes,"
487,IX.,He chased it o'er the wavy river:
488,IX.,"He marked his time and seized his prize,"
489,IX.,But in his hand it burst for ever!
490,IX.,
491,IX.,"Upon the river's marge he sate,"
492,IX.,The tears adown his young cheek gushing;
493,IX.,"And long,--his heart disconsolate--"
494,IX.,He heeded not the river's rushing.
495,IX.,
496,IX.,But tears will cease. And now the boy
497,IX.,Once more looked forth upon the stream:
498,IX.,"'Twas morning still, and lo! a toy,"
499,IX.,"Bright as the last one, in the beam!"
500,IX.,
501,IX.,He rose--pursued--the bubble caught;
502,IX.,It burst--he sighed--then others chased;
503,IX.,"And as I parted, still he sought"
504,IX.,New bubbles in their downward haste.
505,IX.,
506,IX.,"My onward path I still pursued,"
507,IX.,Till the high noontide sun was o'er me.
508,IX.,"And now, though changed in form and mood,"
509,IX.,That Youth and river seemed before me.
510,IX.,
511,IX.,"The deepened stream more proudly swept,"
512,IX.,Though chafed by many a vessel's prow;
513,IX.,"The Youth in manhood's vigor stept,"
514,IX.,But care was chiselled on his brow.
515,IX.,
516,IX.,"Still on the stream he kept his eye,"
517,IX.,"And wooed the bubbles to the shore,"
518,IX.,"And snatched them, as they circled by,"
519,IX.,Though bursting as they burst before.
520,IX.,
521,IX.,Once more we parted. Yet again
522,IX.,We met--though now 'twas evening dim:
523,IX.,"Onward the waters rushed amain,"
524,IX.,And vanished o'er a cataract's brim.
525,IX.,
526,IX.,"Though swift and dark the raging surge,"
527,IX.,The Bubble-Chaser still was there;
528,IX.,"And, bending o'er the dizzy verge,"
529,IX.,Clutched at the gaudy things of air.
530,IX.,
531,IX.,"With staff in hand and tottering knee,"
532,IX.,"Upon the slippery brink he stood,"
533,IX.,"And watched, with doting ecstasy,"
534,IX.,Each wreath of foam that rode the flood.
535,IX.,
536,IX.,"""One bubble more!"" I heard him call,"
537,IX.,And saw his trembling fingers play:
538,IX.,"He snatched, and down the roaring fall,"
539,IX.,"With the lost bubble, passed away!"

548,IX.,
549,IX.,"When I was young--long, long ago--"
550,IX.,I dreamed myself among the flowers;
551,IX.,"And fancy drew the picture so,"
552,IX.,They seemed like Fairies in their bowers.
553,IX.,
554,IX.,"The rose was still a rose, you know--"
555,IX.,But yet a maid. What could I do?
556,IX.,"You surely would not have me go,"
557,IX.,When rosy maidens seem to woo?
558,IX.,
559,IX.,"My heart was gay, and 'mid the throng"
560,IX.,I sported for an hour or two;
561,IX.,"We danced the flowery paths along,"
562,IX.,And did as youthful lovers do.
563,IX.,
564,IX.,"But sports must cease, and so I dreamed"
565,IX.,"To part with these, my fairy flowers--"
566,IX.,"But oh, how very hard it seemed"
567,IX.,To say good-by 'mid such sweet bowers!
568,IX.,
569,IX.,And one fair Maid of modest air
570,IX.,Gazed on me with her eye of blue;
571,IX.,I saw the tear-drop gathering there--
572,IX.,"How could I say to her, Adieu!"
573,IX.,
574,IX.,"I fondly gave my hand and heart,"
575,IX.,And we were wed. Bright hour of youth!
576,IX.,How little did I think to part
577,IX.,"With my sweet bride, whose name was Truth!"
578,IX.,
579,IX.,"But time passed on, and Truth grew gray,"
580,IX.,"And chided, though with gentlest art:"
581,IX.,"I loved her, though I went astray,"
582,IX.,And almost broke her faithful heart.
583,IX.,
584,IX.,"And then I left her, and in tears--"
585,IX.,These could not move my hardened breast!
586,IX.,"I wandered, and for weary years"
587,IX.,"I sought for bliss, but found no rest."
588,IX.,
589,IX.,I sought--yet ever sought in vain--
590,IX.,"To find the peace, the joy of youth:"
591,IX.,"At last, I turned me back again,"
592,IX.,And found them with my faithful Truth.

611,I.,"In the hollow tube and the whitened skull,"
612,I.,"They crouch in fear or in whispers wail,"

626,II.,"I saw a form in the flashing spray,"
627,II.,And white arms beckoned me away.
628,II.,"Away o'er the tide we went together,"
629,II.,Through shade and mist and stormy weather--
630,II.,"Away, away, o'er the lonely water,"
631,II.,"On wings of thought like shadows we flew,"

634,II.,"The staggering ship to the gale we left,"
635,II.,The drifting corse and the vacant boat;
636,II.,The ghastly swimmer all hope bereft--
637,II.,We left them there on the sea to float!
638,II.,"Through mist and shade and stormy weather,"
639,II.,"That night we went to the icy Pole,"
640,II.,"And there on the rocks we stood together,"
641,II.,And saw the ocean before us roll.
642,II.,"No moon shone down on the hermit sea,"
643,II.,"No cheering beacon illumed the shore,"
644,II.,"No ship on the water, no light on the lea,"
645,II.,No sound in the ear but the billow's roar!
646,II.,"But the wave was bright, as if lit with pearls,"
647,II.,And fearful things on its bosom played;
648,II.,"Huge crakens circled in foamy whirls,"
649,II.,"As if the deep for their sport was made,"
650,II.,"And mighty whales through the crystal dashed,"
651,II.,"And upward sent the far glittering spray,"

661,III.,As if its depths were their holy dwelling?
662,III.,"We met more beautiful scenes that night,"
663,III.,"As we slid along in our spirit-car,"
664,III.,"For we crossed the South Sea, and, ere the light,"
665,III.,We doubled Cape Horn on a shooting star.
666,III.,"In our way we stooped o'er a moonlit isle,"
667,III.,"Which the fairies had built in the lonely sea,"
668,III.,"And the Surf Sprite's brow was bent with a smile,"
669,III.,As we gazed through the mist on their revelry.
670,III.,"The ripples that swept to the pebbly shore,"
671,III.,"O'er shells of purple in wantonness played,"
672,III.,"And the whispering zephyrs sweet odors bore,"
673,III.,From roses that bloomed amid silence and shade.
674,III.,"In winding grottos, with gems all bright,"
675,III.,"Soft music trembled from harps unseen,"
676,III.,"And fair forms glided on wings of light,"
677,III.,"'Mid forests of fragrance, and valleys of green."
678,III.,"There were voices of gladness the heart to beguile,"
679,III.,And glances of beauty too fond to be true--
680,III.,"For the Surf Sprite shrieked, and the Fairy Isle,"
681,III.,By the breath of the tempest was swept from our view.

688,IV.,"From stooping clouds the red lightnings gushed,"
689,IV.,And thunders moved in their blazing path.
690,IV.,"'Twas a fearful night, but my shadowy guide"
691,IV.,"Had a voice of glee as we rode on the gale,"
692,IV.,"For we saw afar a ship on the tide,"
693,IV.,With a bounding course and a fearless sail.
694,IV.,"In darkness it came, like a storm-sent bird,"
695,IV.,But another ship it met on the wave:
696,IV.,"A shock--a shout--but no more we heard,"
697,IV.,For they both went down to their ocean-grave!
698,IV.,"We paused on the misty wing of the storm,"
699,IV.,"As a ruddy flash lit the face of the deep,"
700,IV.,And far in its bosom full many a form
701,IV.,Was swinging down to its silent sleep.
702,IV.,"Another flash! and they seemed to rest,"
703,IV.,"In scattered groups, on the floor of the tide:"
704,IV.,"The lover and loved, they were breast to breast,"
705,IV.,"The mother and babe, they were side by side."
706,IV.,"The leaping waves clapped their hands in joy,"
707,IV.,"And gleams of gold with the waters flowed,"

718,V.,"My spirit sank, for aloft in the cloud,"
719,V.,"A Star-set Flag on the whirlwind flew,"
720,V.,And I knew that the billow must be the shroud
721,V.,Of the noble ship and her gallant crew.
722,V.,"Her side was striped with a belt of white,"
723,V.,"And a dozen guns from each battery frowned,"
724,V.,"But the lightning came in a sheet of flame,[B]"
725,V.,And the towering sails in its folds were wound.
726,V.,"Vain, vain was the shout, that in battle rout,"
727,V.,"Had rung as a knell in the ear of the foe,"
728,V.,"For the bursting deck was heaved from the wreck,"
729,V.,And the sky was bathed in the awful glow!
730,V.,"The ocean shook to its oozy bed,"
731,V.,"As the swelling sound to the canopy went,"
732,V.,And the splintered fires like meteors shed
733,V.,Their light o'er the tossing element.
734,V.,"A moment they gleamed, then sank in the foam,"
735,V.,And darkness swept over the gorgeous glare--

777,VI.,"It rose--for the guardian zephyrs had flown,"

779,VI.,"No sigh was borne from the leafy hill,"

797,VI.,
798,VI.,"With a lover's sigh, and a zephyr's breath,"

811,VI.,"The Frost Spirit went, like the lover light,"
812,VI.,In search of fresh beauty and bloom that night
813,VI.,"Its wing was plumed by the moon's cold ray,"
814,VI.,And noiseless it flew o'er the hills away.
815,VI.,"It flew, yet its dallying fingers played,"
816,VI.,"With a thrilling touch, through the maple's shade;"
817,VI.,"It toyed with the leaves of the sturdy oak,"

824,VI.,"It flew to the meadow, and hovering light"

827,VI.,"Each spreading bough heard the whispered bliss,"

829,VI.,"Though giving, the leaves disdainingly shook,"
830,VI.,As if refusing the boon they took.
831,VI.,
832,VI.,"Who dreamed that the morning's light would speak,"
833,VI.,And show that kiss on the blushing cheek?
834,VI.,For in silence the fairy work went through--

851,VI.,"Protesting their innocence, looked to the skies:"
852,VI.,"And the sumach rouged deeper, as stooping to look,"

854,VI.,"The delicate aspen grew nervous and pale,"
855,VI.,As the tittering forest seemed full of the tale;
856,VI.,"And the lofty ash, though it tossed up its bough,"
857,VI.,"With a puritan air on the mountain's brow,"

920,VI.,I gazed on the scene--I saw despair
921,VI.,On the pallid brows of a youthful pair.
922,VI.,"The maiden drooped like a gentle flower,"
923,VI.,When lashed by the gale in its quivering bower:
924,VI.,"Her arms round her lover she wildly twined,"
925,VI.,And gazed on the sea with a wildered mind.
926,VI.,"He bent o'er the trembler, and sheltered her form,"
927,VI.,"From the plash of the sea, and the sweep of the storm;"
928,VI.,"But woe to the lover, and woe to the maid,"
929,VI.,Whose hopes on the treacherous deep are laid!
930,VI.,"For the Sea hath a King whose palaces shine,"

2882,XI.,From the wild uproar of the waves.
2883,XI.,With beckoning hands they seemed to urge
2884,XI.,"My footsteps down the dizzy way,"
2885,XI.,"To join their train upon the surge,"
2886,XI.,And dance with them amidst the spray:
2887,XI.,"And such the madness of my brain,"

2889,XI.,"To meet and mingle on the main,"
2890,XI.,With their mad revelry and song.
2891,XI.,"One step, and down the dizzy cliff,"

2909,XII.,"No father's hand my pride to yoke,"
2910,XII.,No mother's angel voice to warn.

2914,XII.,"With one soft whisper, ""Peace, be still!""--"
2915,XII.,"That vision, spurned by manhood's pride,"
2916,XII.,"Came down from heaven to me no more,"

2927,XII.,"Yes, for the smoothest lake hath waves"

3037,XIV.,Along the lone lake's pebbly shore;
3038,XIV.,I hear the sweeping gust that weaves
3039,XIV.,"The tree tops, and the winds that pour"

3310,XIX.,"With fond regret, I still pursued the theme--"
3311,XIX.,"With clambering step still up the steep was borne,"
3312,XIX.,"Too sad to smile, too pleased perchance to mourn."
3313,XIX.,
3314,XIX.,"And now I stood beside that rivulet's spring,"
3315,XIX.,That came unbidden with a bubbling bound--
3316,XIX.,"And stealing forth, a gentle trembling thing,"
3317,XIX.,It seemed an infant fearing all around--
3318,XIX.,Yet clinging to its mother's breast--the ground.
3319,XIX.,"But soon it bolder grew, and with a wing"
3320,XIX.,"It went: its carol was a joyous sound,"
3321,XIX.,"Making the silent woods responsive ring,"
3322,XIX.,"And the far forest-echoes, sighing, sing."
3323,XIX.,
3324,XIX.,And now I stood upon the mountain's height--
3325,XIX.,"Like a wide map, the landscape lay unrolled--"
3326,XIX.,"There could I trace that rivulet's path of light,"
3327,XIX.,From the steep mountain to the sea of gold;
3328,XIX.,"Now leaping o'er the rocks like chamois bold,--"
3329,XIX.,"Now like a crouching hare concealed from sight,--"
3330,XIX.,"Now hid beneath the willow's bowering fold,"
3331,XIX.,"As if they sought to stay its arrowy flight,"
3332,XIX.,Then give it forth again more swift and bright.
3333,XIX.,
3334,XIX.,"'Twas changeful--beautiful; now dark, now fair--"
3335,XIX.,"A tale of life, from childhood to the tomb--"
3336,XIX.,"Its birth-place near the skies, in mountain air,"
3337,XIX.,"Where wild flowers throw around their sweet perfume,"
3338,XIX.,"Like the blest thoughts that often brightly bloom,"
3339,XIX.,"At home, beneath a mother's culturing care--"
3340,XIX.,"Its form now hid in shadows, such as gloom"
3341,XIX.,"Our downward way--its grave in ocean, where"
3342,XIX.,It mingles with the wave--a dweller there!
3343,XIX.,
3344,XIX.,"And though that stream be hidden from the view,"
3345,XIX.,'Tis yet preserved 'neath ocean's briny crest:
3346,XIX.,That wide eternity of waves is true--
3347,XIX.,"And as the planets anchored in their rest,"
3348,XIX.,"The sparkling streamlet lives; and while unblest,"
3349,XIX.,The land-wave stagnant lingers--there the blue
3350,XIX.,Tide holds the river stainless in its breast--
3351,XIX.,"An image still of life, that sparkles through"
3352,XIX.,"The starry deep of heaven, for ever new."
