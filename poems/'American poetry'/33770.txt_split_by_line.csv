206,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,
207,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,And you don't _read_ poetry very much.
208,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,(Such
209,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,"Is my own case also.) ""But,"" you cry,"

245,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,So you wouldn't look at the worthy stuff.
246,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,But knowing what you prefer to read
247,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,"I'm setting the pace at about your speed,"
248,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,Being rather convinced these truths will hold you
249,DEAD MEN'S DUST.,A little bit better than if I'd told you
