47,I,I
48,I,
49,I,Go search the æons an you will
50,I,"Where withered leaves of Doubt are whirled,"
51,I,"And who hath solved this riddle, Life,"
52,I,"Or Death—that moves with sails unfurled,"
53,I,Beyond the straining eyes of man
54,I,Marooned upon an unknown world.
55,I,
56,II,II
57,II,
58,II,"Nor tongue hath told, nor vision caught"
59,II,"That paradox, Primeval Cause;"
60,II,Each age has had some parable
61,II,Each age succeeding marked the flaws;
62,II,"While shifted, with the calendar,"
63,II,What men have termed generic laws.
64,II,
65,III,III
66,III,
67,III,Creed after creed behold them now
68,III,Like Etna on Vesuvius piled;
69,III,"Till, scaled to earth by drifting sands"
70,III,"They lie in later days reviled,"
71,III,And pushed aside by Time’s rough hand
72,III,"As toys are, by a peevish child."
73,III,
74,IV,IV
75,IV,
76,IV,For Priest-made doctrine reads grotesque.
77,IV,And earthly worship is but dross;
78,IV,Whether it be your Brahm of Ind
79,IV,Or squat and hideous Chinese Joss;
80,IV,"Or Jove, aloft on cloud-capped throne"
81,IV,Or the pale Christ upon his cross.
82,IV,
83,V,V
84,V,
85,V,Why question still the blindfold graves
86,V,Or pluck the veil of Isis dread?
87,V,Over Death’s icy mystery
88,V,A pall immutable is spread;
89,V,And never tear-wrung agony
90,V,Shall move the lips we loved—once dead.
91,V,
92,VI,VI
93,VI,
94,VI,Why grope in labyrinthian maze?
95,VI,Why palter thus with doubt and fear?
96,VI,The Past is but the mollusc print
97,VI,"The Future looms, a barrier sheer;"
98,VI,The Present centers in To-day
99,VI,"The hope for men is Now, and Here."
100,VI,
101,VII,VII
102,VII,
103,VII,Believe no scientific cant
104,VII,That man descended from the ape;
105,VII,Gorilla-like once beat his breast
106,VII,"And grew at last to human shape,"
107,VII,"To watch the flocks, and till the fields,"
108,VII,Harry the seas and bruise the grape.
109,VII,
110,VIII,VIII
111,VIII,
112,VIII,For though enrobed in savage skins
113,VIII,"And though his forehead backward ran,"
114,VIII,The brute was not all-dominant
115,VIII,Some spark revealed a Primal plan;
116,VIII,His brain was coupled with his will
117,VIII,The hairy mammal still was man.
118,VIII,
119,IX,IX
120,IX,
121,IX,And ever as the cycles waned
122,IX,"He came and went, he rose and fell,"
123,IX,"At times transformed, as butterflies"
124,IX,That rise from chrysalis in the cell;
125,IX,And oft through hate and ignorance
126,IX,Sunk downward deep as fabled Hell.
127,IX,
128,X,X
129,X,
130,X,"But through it all, and with it all"
131,X,"How-e’er the upward trending veers,"
132,X,He fought his fight against great odds
133,X,"He peopled ice-bound hemispheres,"
134,X,Endured the sweltering Torrid Zones
135,X,And stamped his impress on the years.

143,I,I
144,I,
145,I,What romance hast thy childhood known
146,I,Of God-made world in seven days?
147,I,Of woven sands and swaying grass
148,I,"And bird and beast in forest ways,"
149,I,Of panoramas vast unrolled
150,I,Before a stern Creator’s gaze?
151,I,
152,II,II
153,II,
154,II,Of rivers ribboning the vales;
155,II,"Of plains that stretched in smoothness down,"
156,II,And unborn seasons yet to be
157,II,"Spring’s violet banks, and Autumn’s brown;"
158,II,"Bright Summer, mistress of the sun,"
159,II,And grey-beard Winter’s boreal crown.
160,II,
161,III,III
162,III,
163,III,And when at length the scheme complete
164,III,"Unfolded to the Maker’s sight,"
165,III,"How He, Almighty and divine"
166,III,"Said in his power, ""Let there be light!"""
167,III,"Gave sun and moon, and sowed the stars"
168,III,Along the furrows of the night!
169,III,
170,IV,IV
171,IV,
172,IV,Lo! every nation has its tale
173,IV,"And every people, how they be;"
174,IV,Whether where Southern zephyrs loose
175,IV,"The blooms from off the tamarind tree,"
176,IV,Or where the six-month seasons bide
177,IV,Around the cloistered Polar sea.
178,IV,
179,V,V
180,V,
181,V,And Science with unyielding scales
182,V,Weighs each and all of varied styles;
183,V,And like a Goddess molds decrees
184,V,Oblivious both to tears or smiles;
185,V,"Points out the error, reads the rule"
186,V,And God with Nature reconciles.
187,V,
188,VI,VI
189,VI,
190,VI,But who shall sift the false and true?
191,VI,What Oracle the rule enforce?
192,VI,"Not man-made creed, nor man-learned law"
193,VI,Is wise to fathom Nature’s course;
194,VI,No sea is deeper than its bed
195,VI,No stream is higher than its source.
196,VI,
197,VII,VII
198,VII,
199,VII,Vain hope to solve the Infinite!
200,VII,"Mere words to babble, when they say"
201,VII,"""Thus Science teaches,""—""thus our God""—"
202,VII,"Thus this or that—what of it, pray?"
203,VII,The marvel overlapping all—
204,VII,Go ask the Sphynx of Yesterday.
205,VII,
206,VIII,VIII
207,VIII,
208,VIII,"We know the All, and nothing know;"
209,VIII,The great we ken as well as least;
210,VIII,But sum it all when we have said
211,VIII,That man is different from the beast;
212,VIII,And spite of all Theology
213,VIII,The Pagan’s equal to the Priest.
214,VIII,
215,IX,IX
216,IX,
217,IX,"And globes will lapse, and suns expire;"
218,IX,"As stars have fallen, worlds can change;"
219,IX,Forever shall the centuries roll
220,IX,And roving planets tireless range;
221,IX,And Life be masked in secrecy
222,IX,"With Death, as ever, passing strange."
223,IX,
224,X,X
225,X,
226,X,"And trow not, Mortal, in thy pride"
227,X,That where yon beetling column stands
228,X,Rests Permanence; ’twill disappear
229,X,"To sink in marsh or barren lands,"
230,X,"Where bitterns boom, or sunlight stares"
231,X,Across the immemorial sands.

239,I,I
240,I,
241,I,Of old when man to being came
242,I,He fashioned Gods of brittle bone;
243,I,Bowed down to wooden fetiches
244,I,Or worshipped idols carved from stone;
245,I,"And, locked in Superstition’s grasp"
246,I,For sacrifice made lives atone.
247,I,
248,II,II
249,II,
250,II,And Fear was then the Higher Law
251,II,And fleshly joys the aftermath;
252,II,He knew no screed of Righteousness
253,II,And trod no straight and narrow path;
254,II,His Deity a terror was
255,II,A Demon winged with might and wrath.
256,II,
257,III,III
258,III,
259,III,And then where Nilus dipped his feet
260,III,"By Egypt sands, rose temples tall"
261,III,To Isis and Osiris—Ptah—
262,III,And many a God foredoomed to fall;
263,III,Where sank the shades of Pharaoh’s reign?
264,III,"Whence have they vanished, one and all?"
265,III,
266,IV,IV
267,IV,
268,IV,But whiles to other years advanced
269,IV,"And now by cosmic marvels won,"
270,IV,Men sought remote Pelagian shores
271,IV,"Where breeze and spray their tapestry spun,"
272,IV,To wait the coming of the day
273,IV,And there adore the rising sun.
274,IV,
275,V,V
276,V,
277,V,This passed; the Gods of Greece and Rome
278,V,In splendor thronged the earth and skies;
279,V,"Jove, with the thunders in his hand"
280,V,"Apollo of the star-lit eyes,"
281,V,"Aurora, Priestess of the Dawn"
282,V,"And Pan of haunting melodies,—"
283,V,
284,VI,VI
285,VI,
286,VI,And countless more; their temples fair
287,VI,"Where reverent Pagans curved the knee,"
288,VI,"Mid sweet, perpetual summer stood"
289,VI,"While murmured as the murmuring bee,"
290,VI,The lulling sweep of listless brine
291,VI,Beside the green Ægean sea.
292,VI,
293,VII,VII
294,VII,
295,VII,And merged in island-wooded calms
296,VII,"By towering groves of ancient oak,"
297,VII,where Triton’s charging cavalry
298,VII,"Against the cliffs of Britain broke,"
299,VII,With horrid rite of human blood
300,VII,The Celtic Druids moved and spoke.
301,VII,
302,VIII,VIII
303,VIII,
304,VIII,Still wheeled the cycles; still did men
305,VIII,With new religions make them wise;
306,VIII,Mahomet rose magnificent
307,VIII,As rainbow in the eastern skies;
308,VIII,With Seven Heavens of Koran taught
309,VIII,And Houris with the sloe-black eyes.
310,VIII,
311,IX,IX
312,IX,
313,IX,"Brahm, Baal, Dagon, Moloch, Thor,"
314,IX,And legions more had long sufficed;
315,IX,Heavens in turn with bliss diverse
316,IX,And Hells with ebon glaciers iced;
317,IX,And latest on celestial scrolls
318,IX,The prophets wrote the name of Christ.
319,IX,
320,X,X
321,X,
322,X,We need them not; No! each and all
323,X,Will load Tradition’s dusty shelf;
324,X,"As shattered Idols, put away"
325,X,To lie forgot like broken delf;
326,X,Humanity is over all!
327,X,And Man’s redemption in himself.

336,I,
337,I,The morning stars together sang
338,I,"So runs the story, in that time,"
339,I,When groves were loud with melody
340,I,And ripples danced to liquid rhyme;
341,I,Far in the embryonic spheres
342,I,Before the earth was in her prime.
343,I,
344,II,II
345,II,
346,II,Then first the feline-padded gales
347,II,"Unleashed and prowling journeyed free,"
348,II,To purr amid the cowering grass
349,II,"Or roar in stormy jubilee,"
350,II,"Or, joining in with Ocean, growl"
351,II,A hoarse duet of wind and sea.
352,II,
353,III,III
354,III,
355,III,And where by meadowy rushes dank
356,III,"The yellow sunbeams thick were sown,"
357,III,And brooks flowed down through April ways
358,III,"O’er pebbled bar and shingly stone,"
359,III,There first welled up in gurgling strain
360,III,The lisping current’s monotone.
361,III,
362,IV,IV
363,IV,
364,IV,"And oft was heard, in forest aisles"
365,IV,"Where rocking trees of leaves were thinned,"
366,IV,And drear November wandered lorn
367,IV,"With wild wide eyes and hair unpinned,"
368,IV,A wailing harp of minor chords
369,IV,Struck by the strong hands of the wind.
370,IV,
371,V,V
372,V,
373,V,"And Man, through imitative art,"
374,V,"With clumsy tool and method crude,"
375,V,Copied these echoes as he might
376,V,To soothe him in his solitude;
377,V,And when that other sound was dumb
378,V,His reed-notes quavered music rude.
379,V,
380,VI,VI
381,VI,
382,VI,And as the gentler graces came
383,VI,"To vivify barbaric night,"
384,VI,"So Poesy, with singing Lyre,"
385,VI,"Descended from Parnassian height,"
386,VI,With constellations aureoled
387,VI,Her raiment wove of flowing light.
388,VI,
389,VII,VII
390,VII,
391,VII,And in Man’s heart a thrill leaped up;
392,VII,His eye was lit by prophet gleams;
393,VII,He sought the truth of When and How
394,VII,He voiced the lyrics of the streams;
395,VII,"His beard was tossed, his locks were gray"
396,VII,His soul beneath the spell of dreams.
397,VII,
398,VIII,VIII
399,VIII,
400,VIII,Thus numbers came; and Poets lived
401,VIII,To chant the glories of the Race;
402,VIII,Their rhyme on limp papyrus roll
403,VIII,"Or etched on crumbling pillar’s base,"
404,VIII,Has long outlived the Kings they sung
405,VIII,And conquered even Time and Space.
406,VIII,
407,IX,IX
408,IX,
409,IX,Aye! vain the vaunt of Heroes; vain
410,IX,The deeds that once were thought sublime;
411,IX,"And vain your Monarchs, briefly staged"
412,IX,In tinselled royal pantomime;
413,IX,Their House was builded on the sands
414,IX,And they unworth a random rhyme.
415,IX,
416,X,X
417,X,
418,X,Vain are the works of man; most vain
419,X,"His bubbled Glory, Aye! or Fame;"
420,X,More fragile than a last-year’s leaf
421,X,Unnoticed of the sunset’s flame;
422,X,And naught endures unless it stands
423,X,Linked with a deathless Poet’s name.

432,I,
433,I,How flourished then the lesser arts
434,I,As man to manhood slowly grew?
435,I,With blackened stick from ruddy fires
436,I,"That on his cave reflections threw,"
437,I,He scrawled the rock which sheltered him
438,I,And thus the first rude picture drew.
439,I,
440,II,II
441,II,
442,II,And catching hints from Nature’s lore
443,II,He squeezed his colors from the clay;
444,II,"Steeped leaf and bark, and dyed the skins"
445,II,That round about his dwelling lay;
446,II,"And, urged by vanity, his cheeks"
447,II,Were daubed with dash of pigments gay.
448,II,
449,III,III
450,III,
451,III,"So, ever as the seasons died"
452,III,His mind expanded with his will;
453,III,He saw the dry leaves touched with gold
454,III,And grass grow tawny on the hill;
455,III,Found etchings on the ruffled streams
456,III,And marked the sunset’s hectic thrill.
457,III,
458,IV,IV
459,IV,
460,IV,"And dreaming thus, with defter skill"
461,IV,"He fast employed his nights and days,"
462,IV,Spun magic webs of chequered lights
463,IV,And limned October’s purple haze;
464,IV,While women’s faces from his brush
465,IV,"Fired, like wine, the se’er’s gaze."
466,IV,
467,V,V
468,V,
469,V,Until at last was handed down
470,V,"Beyond the treasure-trove of Greece,"
471,V,Beyond the strain that Sappho sung
472,V,"And reveries of the Golden Fleece,"
473,V,"The art of Titian, Rubens, Thal,"
474,V,And Tintoretto’s masterpiece.
475,V,
476,VI,VI
477,VI,
478,VI,"Thus, too, as man with curious eye"
479,VI,"Had noted outline, curve, and form,"
480,VI,In toppling surge or lofty crag
481,VI,"In woman’s bosom beating warm,"
482,VI,In cloudy shapes revealed on high
483,VI,"Intaglios of the wind and storm,—"
484,VI,
485,VII,VII
486,VII,
487,VII,He modelled from the plastic loam;
488,VII,On shell and boulder graved a sign;
489,VII,Chiselled the stately obelisks
490,VII,"With hieroglyphics, line on line;"
491,VII,Colossal wrought his haughty Kings
492,VII,Or metal-traced the clambering vine.
493,VII,
494,VIII,VIII
495,VIII,
496,VIII,And many an image was his work
497,VIII,And many a statuette and bust;
498,VIII,"Some that remain, but most that lie"
499,VIII,As shards to outer darkness thrust;
500,VIII,These buried under coral sands
501,VIII,Those cloaked beneath forgotten dust.
502,VIII,
503,IX,IX
504,IX,
505,IX,Upon the lonely washes that stretch
506,IX,"Where the Egyptian rivers croon,"
507,IX,And floats above the Pyramids
508,IX,"On tropic nights the lifeless moon,"
509,IX,"The mightiest waits,—the brooding Sphynx—"
510,IX,Half-lion and half Daemon hewn.
511,IX,
512,X,X
513,X,
514,X,"So Sculpture, pierced in mountain sides"
515,X,"Or dragged from Mythologic seas,"
516,X,Still holds a sway; and worlds will bow
517,X,In homage yet to such as these—
518,X,"The noble bronze by Phidias wrought,"
519,X,The marbles of Praxiteles.

530,I,"To those who die for freedom’s sake,"
531,I,All Hail!  for them the Immortal dawns
532,I,In waves of lilied silver break;
533,I,For them in dusky-templed night
534,I,The eternal stars a halo make.
535,I,
536,II,II
537,II,
538,II,In History’s tome their chronicle
539,II,An ever-living page shall be;
540,II,The souls who flashed like sabers drawn
541,II,The men who died to make men free;
542,II,Their flag in every land has flown
543,II,Their sails have whitened every sea.
544,II,
545,III,III
546,III,
547,III,On gallows high they met their doom
548,III,Or breasted straight the serried spears
549,III,Of Tyranny; in dungeons damp
550,III,Scarred on the stones their name appears;
551,III,For them the flower of Memory
552,III,"Shall blossom, watered by our tears."
553,III,
554,IV,IV
555,IV,
556,IV,"But Conquest, Glory, transient Fame,"
557,IV,"What baubles these to struggle for,"
558,IV,When draped in sulphurous films uprise
559,IV,The cannon-throated fiends of War!
560,IV,What childish trumpery cheap as this—
561,IV,The trophies of a Conqueror?
562,IV,
563,V,V
564,V,
565,V,How many an army marches forth
566,V,"With bugle-note or battle-hymn,"
567,V,To drench the soil in human gore
568,V,And multiply Golgothas grim;
569,V,And all for what? a Ruler’s pique
570,V,"Religion’s call, or Harlot’s whim."
571,V,
572,VI,VI
573,VI,
574,VI,And ghastliest far among them all
575,VI,Where torn and stained the thirsty sod
576,VI,"With carnage reeks—where standards fly,"
577,VI,"And horses gallop, iron-shod,"
578,VI,Are those remorseless mockeries
579,VI,The wars they wage in name of God.
580,VI,
581,VIII,VIII
582,VIII,
583,VIII,"Vague, dim and vague, and noiselessly,"
584,VIII,The Warrior’s triumphs fade like haze;
585,VIII,And building winds have heaped the sands
586,VIII,O’er monuments of martial days;
587,VIII,While Legend throws a flickering gleam
588,VIII,Where the tall Trojan towers blaze.
589,VIII,
590,VIII,VIII
591,VIII,
592,VIII,Yea! whether sought for Woman’s face
